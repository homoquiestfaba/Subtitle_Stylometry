Wind!

32
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,763
- [Demonic voice] Regina!

33
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,016
Spells can't keep us out.

34
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,518

00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,733

George, help me!

Oh, thank God it's you.

41
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,410
My spells can't
keep them out now.

42
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,787
Getting stronger.

43
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:53,084
Did you bring the
daggers and the diary?

00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:00,800

(groaning)

47
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,852
Stop it.

48
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,312
Please, stop it, George.

49
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,146

57
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,175
(sobbing)

58
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,843
No!

59
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,428
No!

60
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,017
(demonic voices murmuring)

61
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,191
Remember?

62
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:03,113
If the crystal breaks it's
the end of both of us.

63
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,783
- And now, my pig, you die!

64
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,663
- No.

65
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,747
No!

66
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,041
Stop!

67
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,375
Please!

68
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,920
(screaming)

69
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,046

70
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,882
(house exploding)

71
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,879
- I can't stand this anymore.

72
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,548
Cory, would you talk to me?

73
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,841
- About what?

74
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,302
- About anything, about
what you're thinking.

75
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,139
- I'm just thinking
about driving.

76
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,101
- How much farther is
your grandparents' farm?

77
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,353
- I don't know.

78
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,938
I think not far.

79
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,150
- [Elaine] Cory, what
was your dad like?

80
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,903
(dramatic music)

81
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:37,915
- Cory.

82
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,628
- Dad.

83
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,839
- [Elaine] Well, what was
it like when you saw him?

84
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,217
- He was just an old drunk.

85
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,052
Stranger.

86
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,306
- You know, it's funny.

87
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,267
- [Cory] What is?

88
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,894
- I really wanted
you to find your dad.

89
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,481
I thought it would
help you (mumbling).

90
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,483
Now I'm sorry I ever
laid eyes on him.

91
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,027
- What's that supposed to mean?

92
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,154
- It means that in the past 48
hours you've not looked to me

93
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,031
in the face once.

94
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,074
In fact, since you found your
father, you've completely

95
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,534
and totally cut me
out of your life

96
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,828
and I'd just like to know why.

97
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,330
- I brought you with me.

98
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,831
- Yeah.

99
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,917
But for what?

100
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,335
You've not even spoken
10 words with me

101
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,339
since we started up
here this morning.

102
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,804
(dramatic music)

103
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,376
So?

104
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,921
- It's just that since...

105
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,509
It's since I saw my
old man there's uh...

106
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,637
It's been this voice inside
my head like a loud speaker

107
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,307
telling me to get to their farm.

108
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,321
(dramatic music)

109
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,910
I've been here before.

110
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:20,786
- [Elaine] What?

111
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,829
- In a dream.

112
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,211
(dramatic music)

113
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,040
- Welcome home, Cory.

114
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,753
(laughing)

115
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,090
(screaming)

116
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,189
- Cory.

117
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,441
Cory, are you all right?

118
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,859
- Yeah.

119
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,569
Yeah, I'm okay.

120
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,862
- [Elaine] You just seemed
to go somewhere else.

121
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,282
- Well, I'm fine now, really.

122
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,392
(dramatic music)

123
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,575
- How are you, folks?

124
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,411
What can I do for you?

125
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,246
- How do we get to the
Carter place from here?

126
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,540
- The Cat?

127
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,542
There's no such place.

128
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,002
- This map says it's
right near here.

129
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,672
- That map is wrong.

130
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,927
Now, unless you want some gas,
why don't you just move on?!

131
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,572
- Cory, maybe he's right.

132
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,948
The map could be wrong.

133
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,783
Let's just go home.

134
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,618
- No.

135
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,249
This is the place of the dream.

136
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,962
The farm is near, I can feel it.

137
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,147
(door creaking)

138
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,162
Hello!

139
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,416
(door creaking)

140
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,502
Anybody here?

141
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:01,758
Hello!

142
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,359
- [Elaine] Hey, Harman!

143
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,658
(chuckles)

144
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,537
- A Moon for the Misbegotten.

145
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,913
- Oh, please!

146
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,917
Cory, I just want
you to lighten up.

147
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,380
- Bathrooms are back.
(gasping)

148
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,799
- Oh, no, I wasn't--

149
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,469
- Can we get something to drink?

150
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,481
- We have beer, Coke,
water and goat's milk.

151
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,649
- Coke, please.

152
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,443
- Same.

153
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,491
Thank you.

154
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,409
Has anyone else
been in here today?

155
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,454
- Old man Deavers a week ago.

156
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:17,248
And Mrs. Wilson came by with
the Little Linda last week.

157
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,710
Are you Little Linda's friends?

158
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,838
Did you meet her when
she went away to school?

159
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,882
I don't think Little Linda
really went away to school.

160
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,218
I think maybe Little
Linda got into trouble

161
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,137
and they sent her away.

162
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,431
Did you meet Little
Linda at school?

163
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,767
- No, we don't
know Little Linda.

164
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,644
Uh, can you tell us how far
the Carter farm is from here?

165
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,312
(dramatic music)

166
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,816
(door creaks)

167
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,781
- I've never heard of it.

168
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,327
(car engine buzzing)

169
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,622
- That's got to be Dell's Jeep.

170
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,455
- Good.

171
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,000
I wanna get moving.

172
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,173
- Elaine.

173
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,092
- Hi, Dell.

174
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,221
No!

175
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,392
- Well, now, don't you
look good enough to eat?

176
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,477
Cory, my man!

177
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,648
- Ow!

178
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,649
Hi, Dell.

179
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,816
How was the drive?

180
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,317
- Sucked!

181
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,819
But you know how women are:
we passed that last mall,

182
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,655
Terri panicked,
and we had to stop.

183
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,990
- I just got to get
some outdoor clothes.

184
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,494
- And you, you do look
good enough to eat.

185
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,671
That is why I keep her around.

186
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,839
- Bonnie, babe!
- Hi!

187
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,799
- [Elaine] How are you?

188
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,216
- I'm fine.

189
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,509
- [Elaine] You look
simply marvelous.

190
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,136
- Oh, and you look
absolutely divine.

191
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,137
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

192
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,764
(smacking)

193
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,016
(laughing)

194
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,688
- Bizarre greeting
rituals of the subculture.

195
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,109
Good afternoon, Mr. Harman.

196
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,779
- Jack, man, I'm
glad to see you.

197
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,864
- Well, your message
sounded urgent.

198
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,532
So, here we are.

199
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,742
- Thanks for coming.

200
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,868
I mean it.

201
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,369
- I know.

202
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,288
- (mumbling) homos can keep
your hands out of each other

203
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,248
for a second, let's
get something to drink.

204
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,420
- Maybe Cory can tell us why
we are here in the sticks.

205
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,554
- Anybody want a beer?

206
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,055
- No, thanks.

207
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,223
- No, we're fine.

208
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,307
- I'm fine.

209
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,851
- What is it, just a no week?

210
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,686
- Not for me.

211
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,272
- That's why I keep her around.

212
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,281
- This thing is about this big.

213
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,076
- What's so funny?

214
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,077
What is it?!

215
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,453
- Nothing, Dell.

216
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,913
- [Dell] No, what is it?

217
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,082
- It's just a little thing,
Dell, it's not worth mentioning.

218
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,667
- You're right.

219
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,460
- So, Cory, uh...

220
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,129
Why did you bring us up here?

221
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,421
- I found my father.

222
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,548
- Is he okay?

223
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,801
- No, uh...

224
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,805
He slit his wrists the
day after I saw him.

225
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,932
- You didn't tell me that.

226
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,768
- I know.

227
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:24,979
I just couldn't.

228
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,440
Four days after
he was born, uh...

229
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,402
His family disappeared
from a farm near here.

230
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,905
- Where was you dad
when that happened?

231
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,572
- He was in an
incubator in a hospital

232
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,660
and maybe he hadn't been
there, they'd have got him too.

233
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,494
- Did anyone ever
find his family?

234
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,622
- No, but after I was
born, he came up here

235
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,208
to find out what happened.

236
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,669
And he never came home.

237
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,545
I think something bizarre has
been going on at that farm

238
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,881
for a long time.

239
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,759
I'm gonna find out what.

240
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,136
I need your help.

241
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,138
- I'm in.

242
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,140
- Me too.

243
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,019
(door creaking)

244
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,786
- Let me give you
some advice, son.

245
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:26,206
Take your friends
and go home now.

246
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,208
- You've got business
at that farm.

247
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,085
Belongs to me now.

248
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,879
- You do not own that property.

249
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,840
- Oh, yeah?

250
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,592
Then who's the owner
of that land, old man?

251
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,510
You, maybe?

252
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,143
(dramatic music)

253
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,020
- The dead.

254
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,690
- You know, you're not only
got (mumbling) problem,

255
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,526
you're so out of
your fucking mind!

256
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,654
- You got to learn to
respect the elders, boy,

257
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,782
before one of them hurt you.

258
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,201
- Oh, just hold on
a minute here, Mr.

259
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,203
We don't want any trouble.

260
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,454
Do we, Dell?

261
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,415
- No, no, no, no,
no, no trouble.

262
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,667
- Then all of you,
get in them cars

263
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,338
and go back where you came from.

264
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,725
- What is it, Harcourt?

265
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,727
What are you trying to hide?

266
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,189
- I saw what happened
to the Carter family.

267
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,276
It was the drought of 29.

268
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,113
A hot dry wind blew that summer.

269
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:44,325
The cattle and the crops
were burning to a crisp.

270
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,246
The smell of death
hung in the air.

271
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,582
It happened on a Sunday.

272
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:56,255
All the families were in
church, except the Carters.

273
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,633
And they never missed church,

274
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:04,806
so that evening I went up to
see if they were all right.

275
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,269
God help me, I saw them...

276
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,603
I saw--

277
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,272
- Saw what, what did you see?

278
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,274
- Blood everywhere!

279
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,402
Black blood on the walls!

280
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,824
Figures in the dark,
laughing, coming to me.

281
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,118
And I screamed, then I ran.

282
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,291
And I never told a soul.

283
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,173
Til now.

284
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,020
I let it not even loaded.

285
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,316
Please, boy, don't go up there.

286
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,235
- I have to.

287
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,653
- I know.

288
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,491
Well, you just follow
that road to...

289
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,534
Till it ends.

290
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:09,745
- Thanks.

291
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,917
It's all right.

292
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,169
It's all right.

293
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,550
(epic instrumental music)

294
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,014
- Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

295
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,225
Welcome to the wonderful
world of magic.

296
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,645
Today we will take you to the
land of illusion and fantasy,

297
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,106
where the common
place is fantastic

298
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,943
and the fantastic
is common place.

299
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,695
- I didn't know your former
boy was gonna be here.

300
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,821
- Oh, neither did I.

301
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:49,326
(epic instrumental music)

302
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,058
- A princess should
always have flowers.

303
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,353
(clanging)

304
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,731
(clanging)

305
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,693
(clanging)

306
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,612
(clanging)

307
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,907
(clanging)

308
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,747
(clanging)

309
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,833
- Skinny little chicken,

310
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,460
I'll shove that karate
crap up your ass!

311
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,212
- Be my guest.

312
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,338
(bursting)

313
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,424
- Come on, man, easy now.

314
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,261
Easy now, don't hurt the rabbit.

315
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:58,269
- Dell, Dell, Dell,
Dell, cool out.

316
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,021
I asked these guys to
come and help me, okay?

317
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,481
This I don't need.

318
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,773
- I have to agree with him.

319
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,442
We don't need the Feast
and Fury demonstration,

320
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,651
you know what I mean?

321
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,611
Hi, Cory.

322
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,113
- Hi, Stacy.

323
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,031
I didn't think you guys
were gonna make it.

324
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,282
- What?

325
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,994
And miss the chance
to play (mumbling),

326
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:16,787
to bring magic and wonder
to the inner lands?

327
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,665
The hangout with the
beautiful people?

328
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,336
My man, there just isn't
any other place to be.

329
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,673
Besides, you needed
us to be here, so...

330
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,300
Voilà.

331
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,301
Here we are.

332
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,136
- Glad to have you.

333
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,054
- So, uh...

334
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,306
What exactly is the nature
of this little expedition,

335
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,557
if I may ask?

336
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,352
- Follow me up the road
away and I'll show you.

337
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,021
Dell, are you still coming?

338
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,773
- Yeah, yeah, we're in.

339
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,316
- What about you?

340
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,526
- I don't know why or where,

341
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,319
but I wouldn't miss
it for anything.

342
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,781
- All right, let's get going.

343
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,543
- Next time, you little fag,
I'll drop you like a bad habit.

344
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,672
(car engine roaring)

345
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,009
- Shazam!

346
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,439
- Son of a bitch and idiots!

347
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,822
- Still onboard?

348
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,741
- All the way, Captain.

349
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:40,621
- You're making a
bad mistake, boy.

350
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,459
- Maybe so, but
it's mine to make.

351
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,719
(car engines roaring)

352
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,160
- Damned fools!

353
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,456
(dramatic music)

354
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,798
- What are you going to
expect to find up here?

355
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,553
- I need to have some
answers about who I am.

356
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:22,743
- Jesus!

357
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,724
What do you think happened here?

358
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,935
- I wonder who it is?

359
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,980
- Stay away from it!

360
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,231
Don't touch it!

361
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,066
Please.

362
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,919
(dramatic music)

363
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,242
(screaming)

364
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:48,786
- What is it, Bonnie?

365
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,620
What's wrong?

366
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,121
- That!

367
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,917
(dramatic music)

368
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,218
(buzzing)

369
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,974
(wind howling)

370
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,335
- It's my dad's older brother.

371
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,795
- How do you know that?

372
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,965
- I just know, that's all.

373
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,135
- Here's the answer to
the mystery right here.

374
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,095
Somebody, somebody
arranged one or two here,

375
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:52,224
tortured whoever is in that
cross and set fire the house.

376
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,895
They must have died in the fire.

377
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,283
- I don't know what happened
here, but you can sure tell

378
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,953
death walked through this place.

379
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,178
(dramatic music)

380
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:51,910
- Cory?

381
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,914
Cory.

382
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,585
Cory.

383
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,636
- I'm going inside.

384
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,763
- Cory, wait.

385
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,849
There's something
really wrong here.

386
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,601
I think we should go.

387
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,060
- Bonnie's right,
Cory, I feel it too.

388
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,645
Don't go in there.

389
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,981
- I have to see what's
through that door.

390
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,190
You guys can wait out here.

391
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,275
- Hey, catch.

392
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,942
(dramatic music)

393
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,746
(dramatic music)

394
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,793
- "To Regina, with all my love."

395
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,730
It's my grandmother.

396
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,399
- "Nunc Protestas,
Satane Vivet."

397
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,569
(howling)

398
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,573
(frantic music)

399
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,578
(banging)

400
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,415
(screaming)

401
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,585
(banging)

402
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,509
(screaming)

403
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,596
(clattering)

404
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,724
(banging)

405
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,434
- Get out!

406
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,270
Get out!

407
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,816
(clattering)

408
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:17,699
- Cory!

409
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,747
(thudding)

410
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,129
- What the hell is
going on here, Harman?!

411
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,255
- I don't know, I don't know!

412
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,464
But what was that Bonnie read?!

413
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,758
What did it say?!

414
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,260
- It was Latin, it says,
"Now Satan shall walk."

415
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,470
- This baby will do the
trick against whatever moves.

416
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,056
- I don't care what it is,
I say we get out of here now

417
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,182
before the sun goes down.

418
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:44,308
- Do what you want.

419
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,309
Whatever is here
killed my grandparents.

420
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,477
I wanna find out why.

421
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,813
(creaking)

422
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,399
(wind howling)

423
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:58,405
- Let's get the hell
out of here, come on!

424
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,076
(dramatic music)

425
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,541
- My battery is dead.

426
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,836
- So it's mine.

427
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,173
- We have to get
out of here now!

428
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,007
- She's right.

429
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,425
This place is possessed.

430
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,844
- Be serious.

431
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,805
I tell you, what we witnessed
here is hallucination.

432
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,932
- Come on, Jack, what happened
in that house was real.

433
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,183
Saw it with your own eyes.

434
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,684
- Well, then I don't
believe my own eyes.

435
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,104
Things like this
simply don't happen.

436
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,148
- Jack, there is something
here, something evil.

437
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,024
- [Jack] Evil?

438
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:34,859
Evil, where?

439
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,318
- There.

440
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,279
It's been waiting all this time.

441
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,197
- [Jack] Waiting for what?

442
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,617
- For us, for us to come here.

443
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,618
Promise me something.

444
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,953
- Anything.

445
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,873
- If we die, don't bury me here.

446
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,041
- [Jack] You're not
going to die, Bonnie.

447
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,501
- Promise me.

448
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,419
- Okay, I promise, but
nothing is going to happen.

449
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,463
I won't let it.

450
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,757
- Let's get her out of here.

451
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,091
- Okay, let's grab
what we can carry

452
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,469
and walk back to the station.

453
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,858
(dramatic music)

454
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,347
- Now look how fast
that fog roamed.

455
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,619
- I think we're in trouble.

456
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,621
- I think you're right.

457
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,540
- I've never seen
a fog like this.

458
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,334
- It's not the same forest.

459
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:16,460
- Of course it is.

460
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,213
- Yeah, (mumbling).

461
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:22,091
The same power that was in
that house is doing this.

462
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,633
- Look, it's coming back!

463
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,221
(wind howling)

464
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:38,815
Where the hell are we now?!

465
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,026
- God, it's cold!

466
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,529
- Oh, no, here it comes again!

467
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,409
(wind howling)

468
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:01,923
Oh, God!

469
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,842
- Oh, no!

470
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,012
- Son of a bitch!

471
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,806
(dramatic music)

472
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,019
(buzzing)

473
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,691
- Dell, stop!

474
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,994
- Hey, where do you
come from, little girl?

475
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,998
(rumbling)

476
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,874
- Dell, are you all right?

477
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,377
- You can't leave.

478
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,129
- No!

479
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,714
(screams)

480
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,341
- You are mine.

481
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,094
(screaming)

482
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,389
(rumbling)

483
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,853
(dramatic music)

484
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,608
- You...

485
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,402
Lied.

486
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,865
(bursting)

487
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,619
(dramatic music)

488
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,331
- Now what do we do, Harman?!

489
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,458
- Well, whatever is here
isn't gonna let us go.

490
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,667
- Then no shit, Sherlock!

491
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,169
Do you have any other
hot news for us?!

492
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,837
- Yeah, the sun is gonna
be down in a few minutes.

493
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,923
We got two choices: the cars
or the house for the night.

494
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,133
I think we'll be
safer in the house.

495
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,594
- But something in there
just tried to kill us!

496
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,096
- I don't think so.

497
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,014
I think whatever it is is
only trying to warn us away.

498
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,182
- [Dell] And how the
hell do you know that?!

499
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,600
- I don't!

500
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,143
It's just a feeling I have.

501
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,686
- Well, that's just crap,
pal, because your feelings

502
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,772
have got us in this shit
hole in the first place!

503
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,775
- I'm going back inside.

504
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,702
(snorting)

505
00:40:55,703 --> 00:41:00,457
- Well, I'm not sleeping out
here with you and (mumbling).

506
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,959
- Lead on, McDuff.

507
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,211
- You're crazy.

508
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,297
Hold it, you're all crazy!

509
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,098
- We have to talk.

510
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,433
- Chuck, there's nothing
left for us to talk about.

511
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,893
- Come on, Terri, I
can see it in your eyes

512
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,270
back at the cafe.

513
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,104
- Chuck, you're
mistaken, I'm Dell's now.

514
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,772
I'm gonna stay with him.

515
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,441
- Terri, I love you.

516
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,611
- Chuck, it's too late for that.

517
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,779
Dell needs me.

518
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,239
You don't.

519
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,823
Life is just a game to you.

520
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,991
It's not to me.

521
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,701
I need somebody who's
serious about me.

522
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,120
Dell is.

523
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,373
(chuckles)

524
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,793
(thudding)

525
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,635
- We could fight if you want to.

526
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:57,348
But we don't have
anything to fight about.

527
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,769
- Well, let's go inside then.

528
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,771
- Good idea.

529
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:25,085
(dramatic music)

530
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,455
- I think it's gonna be okay.

531
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,541
Let's clean up.

532
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,545
(fire crackling)

533
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,289
- [Ghostly voice] Cory.

535
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,128
- Grandmother?

00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,753
- I could ask you
the same thing.

549
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,588
Oh, God!

550
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:01,383
I made you some food.

551
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,594
(laughing)

552
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,474
- Some weekend, huh?

553
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,809
- Yeah.

554
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,603
Really know how to show
a girl a good time.

555
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,440
- I know it may not seem like
it, but I'm glad you're here.

556
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,025
- Oh, I'm glad to
hear you say it.

557
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,610
- I found my
grandmother's diary.

558
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,446
- Oh!

559
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,123
(rustling)

560
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,128
- "It is dusk.

561
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,798
"I know tonight I will die.

562
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,427
"Even the spells Grandmother
taught me can't save us now."

563
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,260
- Spells?

564
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,096
- Yeah.

565
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,974
"I know that someday you
might come to face the evil

566
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,976
"that comes for me.

567
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,436
"In the bottom
drawer of the vanity

568
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:55,937
"you will find two daggers

569
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,690
"which are part of the
sacred set of seven.

570
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:00,400
"The other five have been lost.

571
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,943
"It is written
that with all seven

572
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,903
"you can kill the son of Satan.

573
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,154
(dramatic music)

574
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,825
"I pray these two
might help you."

575
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:45,237
(fire crackling)

576
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,043
I found something.

577
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:03,547
This farm was built by
my great-grandfather.

578
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:06,299
He and a group of settlers
followed a preacher named Anders

579
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,552
to this valley.

580
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:11,137
But when they arrived,
Anders began preaching

581
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,057
about the false
God of the Bible...

582
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,392
And the true God
he had found here.

583
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,228
- He was a Satan worshiper?

584
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,064
- Yeah.

585
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,109
Trying to raise the Devil.

586
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,779
Then three little
girls disappeared.

587
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,948
The searchers found them...

588
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:34,410
What was left of them in an
altar behind Anders' place.

589
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,539
- He was a real sick pup.

590
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,458
- There was a big fight.

591
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:41,626
Anders and all of his
followers were burned to death

592
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,169
in his house.

593
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,755
- That sounds fair.

594
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,883
- I hope they cooked slow.

595
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:53,055
- After that, everything was
okay until the summer of 1929.

596
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:57,391
That was the year
my father was born.

597
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,227
"June 8th.

598
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,063
"Mrs. James just had triplets.

599
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:05,191
"They were killed
right after the birth.

600
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,068
"None of the babies
was even human."

601
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,654
- All the children
were the same.

602
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,447
Except for Cory's dad.

603
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,868
- What was so special about him?

604
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,286
- I have no idea.

605
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,790
But the last entry reads,

606
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,711
"Everyone is dead
except George and I.

607
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,295
"It's all hopeless.

608
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,632
"I can hear them
rising out in the barn.

609
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:29,717
"It's the..."

610
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,638
And that's what
happened to my family.

611
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,806
- Now we're in the
middle of all this.

612
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,809
(dramatic music)

613
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,522
(fire crackling)

614
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,872
- Will the puppets
from hell show tonight?

615
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,457
- My son, if they do,
we'll just have to go out

616
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,002
and kick some supernatural ass.

617
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,754
- Chuck, my man.

618
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,338
I like your attitude.

619
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,633
Very American, very...

620
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:12,634
John Wayne.

621
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,344
- Very what choice do we have?

622
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,346
- It's a good point.

623
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,725
- Man, I just wish we had some
hand grenades or something.

624
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,645
- I'd rather have a
Tahitian vacation.

625
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,021
- Not Tahiti.

626
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,314
- [Chuck] Why not?

627
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:29,067
- Voodoo, man, they
do voodoo in Tahiti.

628
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,736
- Let's say Chicago.

629
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,363
- Vegas.

630
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,866
We know there's no
spiritualism in Vegas.

631
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,201
- Good point.

632
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,328
Vegas, it is.

633
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,371
- Yoo-hoo!

634
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,459
Chuck.

635
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,294
Stacy.

636
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:49,880
Come out!

637
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,425
I'm here for you.

638
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,723
Come out and play with me.

639
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:04,687
Chuck!

640
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,064
Stacy!

641
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,275
Come out.

642
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:13,487
- Demon.

643
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,406
- Stacy!

644
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,035
(wind howling)

645
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,288
- Hey, Cory, guess
what we just saw!

646
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,581
Cory?

647
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,583
Hey, Harman.

648
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,545
Hey, Jack, wake up!

649
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,590
- I guess he only wants us.

650
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,844
- [Demonic girl] Here I am.

651
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,554
- Let's go.

652
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:45,936
- Why not?

653
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:14,464
(demonic voices murmuring)

654
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,888
They're playing our song.

655
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:22,890
- All right.

656
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:24,934
Let's dance.

657
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:30,647
(demonic voices murmuring)

658
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,551
- Over here.

659
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,181
I have something for you.

660
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,070
Surprise!

661
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:23,743
- Eat this!
(gun firing)

662
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,370
Oh, man, I think
we're in trouble.

663
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,455
- I think you're right.

664
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,581
(growling)

665
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,002
(gun firing)

666
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,713
(screaming)

667
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,091
(gun firing)

668
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,843
(screaming)

669
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,221
(gun firing)

670
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,055
(grunting)

671
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,517
(gun firing)

672
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,935
(laughing)

673
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,397
(gun firing)

674
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,446
(grunting)
(gun firing)

675
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,251
I think we've just
to get out of this.

676
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,503
- You doubt it?

677
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,800
(gun firing)

678
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:23,927
Hey, Chuck (groans).

679
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,262
- What, maestro?

680
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,100
- Presto.

681
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:31,936
Eh.

682
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,194
(gun firing)

683
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:51,205
(grunting)

684
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,875
(thudding)

685
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,720
(repetitive thudding)

686
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,725
(dead people murmuring)

687
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,819
- I made it.

688
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,904
I made it!

689
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:25,739
Fuck you!

690
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,992
- Surprise!

691
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:31,494
(screaming)

692
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:32,328
- What happened?

693
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,496
What was that?!

694
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,538
- It came from outside.

695
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:37,001
- Where are Chuck and Stacy?!

696
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,252
(dramatic music)

697
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,087
- Stacy!

698
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,422
Chuck!

699
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,677
(dramatic music)

700
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,512
Oh, no!

701
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:50,347
- My God!

702
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:52,641
Oh, no!

703
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,684
No!

704
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:56,353
No!

705
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,284
- Terri, look, we got
to keep it out together,

706
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,161
we're gonna get
out of this alive.

707
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:14,620
- You didn't just see the blood?

708
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:18,707
- Hey, trust me, I'll
get us out of this, okay?

709
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,543
- Okay.

710
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,923
- Dell, we're gonna
check the backroom.

711
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:25,757
- Yeah.

712
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:41,064
- Why didn't you tell the
others about the daggers

713
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,690
and the spells in the diary?

714
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:44,067
- Tell them what?

715
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,110
That my grandmother was a witch?

716
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:51,032
She used spells to protect
her son and this house?

717
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:53,242
Dell's half crazy and
Jack's a bastard case.

718
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,078
One more thing and
either are gonna lose it.

719
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,706
- Maybe those spells
could help us.

720
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:01,961
- They didn't helped
her much, did they?

721
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:15,848
Keep this with you.

722
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,767
May be some protection.

723
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:21,770
- You don't think we
can beat it, do you?

724
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,856
- I'm sorry I got you into this.

725
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,360
- Don't even think that,
Cory, I got me into this.

726
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,696
I'm here because I love you.

727
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,949
- (mumbling) so lucky.

728
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,784
- Magic.

729
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,413
(wind howling)

730
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,818
(creaking)

731
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,156
(screaming)

732
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:29,172
- Honey, you're all right,
it was only a dream.

733
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:30,882
You're all right now.

734
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,593
- It's not big deal, Dell.

735
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,929
- God, I wish I
was home right now.

736
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:37,763
- Quiet!

737
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,848
(car engine humming)

738
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:40,975
That's a car!

739
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,318
- It's Willy and Reena!

740
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:53,946
- Don't shut it off.

741
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,823
Don't shut it off!

742
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,326
Don't shut it off!

743
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,244
Don't shut it off!

744
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,705
Don't shut it off!

745
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,581
Don't shut it off!

746
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:05,084
Don't shut it off!

747
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,379
- What did you say?

748
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,549
- I said, "Don't shut it off."

749
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,384
- Why not?

750
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,682
(dramatic music)

751
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,518
- But what we did wrong?

752
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,937
We just got here.

753
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,069
(barking)

754
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,246
- Go back inside.

755
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:04,684
- Hey, Cory.

756
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,855
Look, pal, Terri and I aren't
gonna spend another night

757
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,357
in this damned house.

758
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:12,816
Now we're going
through that front door

759
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,943
and we're going for help.

760
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,155
- Dell, are you sure
you wanna do that?

761
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:20,574
- Yeah, I'm sure, sure
as I'm about anything.

762
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,160
(dramatic music)

763
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:25,913
Hey, are you positive
you wanna come with me?

764
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:30,668
- Like I told you before,
honey, wherever you go, I go.

765
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:33,921
- That's why I keep her with me.

766
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,965
(snorts)

767
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,013
- You may need this.

768
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,973
- Thanks, Cory.

769
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,810
Let's get out of here.

770
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,496
- I don't think
they're gonna make it.

771
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,123
- I don't think so, either.

772
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,126
Better get back to work.

773
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,683
Jack.

774
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,601
- Yeah.

775
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:29,352
- I'll be back in a minute.

776
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:30,354
- All right.

777
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,200
(creaking)

778
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,169
(dramatic music)

779
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,213
- Grandmother?

780
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:03,595
Grandmother?

781
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:11,435
Is it you in the
house, isn't it?

782
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:14,230
(fire crackling)

783
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:24,783
Grandmother?

784
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,078
What are the demons afraid of?

785
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:30,914
Grandmother?

786
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:35,584
Grandmother?

787
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,920
- [Elaine] Cory.

788
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,215
- This house is as
secure as it can get.

789
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:44,051
- So what do we do now?

790
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:45,218
- I guess we wait.

791
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,136
- [Jack] No.

792
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,220
- What do you mean?

793
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:49,432
- Well, I say we attack it.

794
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:53,143
Now, Bonnie mentioned she
felt something from the barn.

795
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,353
- Jack's right.

796
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:55,896
My grandmother
mentioned the barn.

797
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,106
Maybe there's a door with
the leads into the barn.

798
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,858
The same with the
leads into this house.

799
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,277
- And if that's the
center of this force,

800
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:05,323
we got to find some
way to destroy it.

801
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:06,782
- Now you're talking.

802
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,659
How about you, guys?

803
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,286
- Sure that beats waiting.

804
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,621
- I don't wanna go,
but if we have to,

805
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,831
let's get it over with.

806
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,123
- I'll get the flashlights.

807
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,917
- I'll get the shotgun.

808
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,671
(dramatic music)

809
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,014
- Oh, no!

810
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:31,850
- Shit!

811
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,645
(wind howling)

812
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:46,322
Terri?

813
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:48,408
Terri!

814
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:52,371
Terri, where the hell are you?!

815
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:59,460
- [Terri] Can't you hear it?

816
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:00,420
- Hear what?

817
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,506
- Death!

818
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:10,847
(thudding)
(groaning)

819
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,314
- But I loved you.

820
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,612
- I loved you too.

821
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:32,368
(laughing)

822
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,874
(wind howling)

823
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:53,556
(howling)

824
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:54,932
- What was that?

825
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,894
- It wasn't human,
that's for sure.

826
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:00,439
- Look.

827
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:04,568
(dramatic music)

828
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:09,739
- Come on.

829
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:14,410
(dramatic music)

830
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:54,158
(dramatic music)

831
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:41,164
(dramatic music)

832
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,318
- What is that?

833
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,366
- It's an altar to the Devil.

834
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,161
- God, it's horrible.

835
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:25,667
- But there's something
kind of beautiful about it.

836
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,090
No, it really is beautiful.

837
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:35,050
(growling)

838
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,468
(whooshing)

839
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,805
(screaming)

840
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:44,810
Come on, help me!

841
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,146
(screaming)

842
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,067
Help me!

843
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:52,902
Help me!

844
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:56,990
(screaming)

845
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,672
- Run, Willy!

846
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,434
- It's just us.

847
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,730
(mumbling)

848
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:33,151
- Dell was good enough to eat.

849
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,950
- But you're dead.

850
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,994
- You can't kill
what's already dead.

851
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,289
(thudding)

852
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:55,422
- Stay right there or I'll
have to blow you in two.

853
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,007
- That thing won't work in here.

854
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,678
This is the house of the damned.

855
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,681
(laughing)

856
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:06,309
(thudding)

857
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:09,436
(grunting)

858
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:10,771
- Cory!

859
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:11,772
Help me!

860
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:15,776
(grunting)
(groaning)

861
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:16,610
- Leave!

862
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,322
Oh, you don't like this, uh?

863
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,533
(grunting)

864
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:40,258
- Cory, where's Willy?

865
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:41,259
- He must still be in the barn!

866
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,219
- [Elaine] Shit!

867
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,846
(screaming)

868
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,180
- Forgot something?

869
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,556
- Ah!

870
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,350
(laughing)

871
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,685
- Isn't he cute?

872
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,858
- Cory, use the dagger!

873
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:58,652
(screaming)

874
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:13,041
- You killed me.

875
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,211
(buzzing)

876
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:19,007
(dramatic music)

877
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,551
(creaking)

878
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:30,058
- You all will scream
in the hell tonight!

879
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,519
- All of you, ha!

880
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,583
(dead people murmuring)

881
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:58,671
- Get ready!

882
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:03,802
(dead people murmuring)

883
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:22,110
(rumbling)

884
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,947
Now what's happening, Harman?

885
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:26,614
- Don't you see?!

886
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:27,866
Ha!

887
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,492
Grandmother's old
spell still works!

888
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:30,743
They can't reach us!

889
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:31,744
- Are you sure?

890
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:33,288
- Yeah!

891
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,539
(laughing)

892
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,958
Eat it, scumbags!

893
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:37,460
- Come and get us!

894
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:40,796
(rumbling)

895
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:53,017
(buzzing)

896
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,997
(banging)

897
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,963
- Cory, now what happened?

898
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:24,172
- Shit!

899
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,716
The demons must have
broken the spell!

900
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:30,720
(dead people murmuring)

901
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:31,679
- Here, take this.

902
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,182
I'm gonna check the backrooms.

903
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,475
- Jack.

904
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:36,768
- Yeah?

905
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,228
- Watch yourself.

906
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:40,189
- Good luck to you too.

907
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:44,402
(dead people murmuring)

908
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,120
(dramatic music)

909
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,918
(dead people murmuring)

910
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,900
- So friend, we meet again.

911
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:29,363
(gun firing)

912
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:45,628
(grunting)

913
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:48,049
(gun firing)

914
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:53,471
(knocking)

915
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:57,433
(gun firing)

916
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:06,024
- Where did they go?

917
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:07,276
- I don't know.

918
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,778
Maybe they're still
afraid of the house.

919

941
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:35,030
Jack!

(groans)

958
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,447
This can't be happening.

959
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:23,120
(dramatic music)

960
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:25,289

Hurry!

972
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,163

can keep them back!

973
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:08,456
- Take the diary and
tell Jack to get in here.

979
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:52,251
- Elaine.

980
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:55,754
It's Jackie.

981
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:59,757
- Oh, no, Jack!

982
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:00,509
Not you.

983
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,178
- It doesn't hurt.

984
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,808
- Jack, we can fight this.

985
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:09,726
- Don't fight.

986
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,520
I'll make it so sweet.

987
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:19,736
(sobbing)

988
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:22,865
You'll give the
Father much pleasure.

989
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:32,291
- Goodbye, Jack.

990
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:38,339

(dead people murmuring)

997
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:10,870
- You all right?

998
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,373
- Look, it's Jack.

999
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:17,084
He turned into one of those
things, I used the last dagger.

1000
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,961
I saw his soul.

1001
01:19:18,962 --> 01:19:19,796
- It's okay.

1002
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:21,047
You did him a favor.

1003
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:22,215
You saved him.

1004
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,804
(banging)

1005
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:31,433

1007
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,775
- Ah!

1008
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:44,111
(dead people murmuring)

1009
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,863
- [Dead man] Kill them.

1010
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:48,033
(whining)

1011
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,790
- I'm sorry.

1012
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:56,958
- I'm not.

1013
01:19:56,959 --> 01:20:00,295
(dead people murmuring)

1014
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,549
- I have arrived, my children.

1015
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:05,675
Gather now.

1016
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:06,969
Come, my sheep.

1017
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,682
I am come to take you.

1018
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,726
Yes, you, the faithful.

1019
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:16,812
Tonight reap your reward.

1020
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,860
Wait is finally over.

1021
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:24,695
Come now.

1022
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,198
Now shall your suffering end.

1023
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:38,083
Our time is at hand.

1024
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:43,672
(dead people murmuring)

1025
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:52,180
Gather now for
the time has come.

I bring you greetings from
the (mumbling) father.

01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:03,776
(dead people murmuring)

1028
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:10,741
Yes, my children, come unto me.

1029
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:17,330
So, my children, at
last have we gathered.

1030
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:23,045
And after all these years
shall we complete the cycle.

1031
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:27,675
- Father, take us.

1032
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,969
- I have fought for him.

1033
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:32,888
I love him.

1034
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:39,437
- Tonight shall we open the
door for our beloved father.

1035
01:21:42,105 --> 01:21:43,356
Yeah, my flock.

1036
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,401
Come.

1037
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:48,487
Come unto me.

1038
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,908

1039
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:56,411
(wind howling)

1040
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:04,544
- No!

1041
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:06,087
No!

1042
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:07,756
No, please, help me!

1043
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:09,674
- Bonnie!

1044
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:11,300
- Oh, God, help me.

1045
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,135
No!

1046
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,429
(screaming)

1047
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,263
- No!

1048
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:17,098
Stop!

1049
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:17,933
Bonnie!

(grunting)

1055
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,860

1056
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:31,863
(screaming)

1057
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:34,782
(grunting)

1058
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:36,283
- There's nothing
we can do for her.

1059
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:37,619
- No!

1060
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,788
(sobbing)

1061
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:44,459

1062
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:52,884
- Now (mumbling),
I've come for thee!

1063
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:53,718
- The book!

1064
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:54,677
The book!

1065
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:55,970
We've got to try it!

1066
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,641
(mumbling), go!

1067
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:05,980
- [Demon] Father of Darkness,
I'm, your son, have arrived.

1068
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:10,234
I have waited long for
this might Cory Harman.

1069
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:12,487
(laughing)

1070
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:18,160
After all these centuries,
now this world will be mine.

1071
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:20,912
(laughing)

1072
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,997
(mumbling)

1073
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:24,082
- I love you.

1074
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:27,127
- I love you too.

1075
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,172
- [Both of them]
Oh, white light,

1076
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:33,465
oh, spirits of
goodness and peace,

1077
01:23:33,466 --> 01:23:36,385
oh, earth mother who
watches over us...

1078
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:37,887
(rumbling)

1079
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:40,557
(mumbling)

1080
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:42,099
We who breathe that breath.

1081
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,269
(banging)

1082
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:48,565
- If you find us
worthy, we beg of you,

1083
01:23:48,566 --> 01:23:50,233
join us now to thee.

1084
01:23:56,824 --> 01:23:59,577
(dramatic music)

1085
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:08,168
- Am I not beautiful?

1086
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:15,718
- I will be done.

1087
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:18,510
(bursting)

1088
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:20,723
(rumbling)

1089
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:31,942
- So, the old witch, she
possessed the great secrets.

1090
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:34,361
- Yes.

1091
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,404
- They did her no good.

1092
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:39,908
I took her also them to grave.

1093
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:44,245
- And now you're
gonna pay for that.

1094
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:47,749
(thudding)
(groaning)

1095
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,250
(grunting)

1096
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:51,836
(dramatic music)

1097
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:56,257
- I will teach you how
to read before you die.

1098
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,510
(rumbling)

1099
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:06,434
(dramatic music)

1100
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:16,778
You were always so weak.

1101
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:18,989
(rumbling)

1102
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,165
- Please, God!

1103
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,459
- The power of your God
is nothing, little man.

1104
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:35,254
I am come to rule this world.

1105
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:37,256
You're the last of your lineage.

1106
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:40,885
The death of yours
will ensure mine.

1107
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,344
(sizzling)

1108
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:44,263
Die, child little man.

1109
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:46,474
(sizzling)

1110
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,289
(rumbling)

1111
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:13,417
- [Elaine] Oh,
he's coming around.

1112
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:14,501
Thank God, Cory.

1113
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:15,712
I can't find your pulse.

1114
01:26:15,713 --> 01:26:17,339
I thought you're...

1115
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:21,801
- Man, you gave us quite
a scare there for a while.

1116
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,510
You looked somewhere else.

1117
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,805
Cory, are you all right?

1118
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,139
- Yeah.

1119
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,809
Just a little woozy.

1120
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:32,603
Where am I?

1121
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:34,146
- We're at your
grandparents' farm, remember?

1122
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:35,523
We drove up here.

1123
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:43,322
- What happened to me?

1124
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:45,950
- We walked in the front
door, looked around

1125
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,701
and you just went
out like a light.

1126
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:48,911
- Man, you hit
the floor so hard,

1127
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:52,999
it was like you had
belted by Mike Tyson.

1128
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,541
- Jack!

1129
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:56,335
Jack, you're all right!

1130
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:57,837
You're all alive!

1131
01:26:57,838 --> 01:26:59,463
- Of course we're all alive.

1132
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:01,215
- Just like real life.

1133
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,260
- You were just dreaming.

1134
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:06,345
- Oops!

1135
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:07,429
(dramatic music)

1136
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:08,348
- Surprise!

1137
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,269
(laughing)

1138
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:21,987
- Cory!

1139
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:23,989
Cory!

1140
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:27,075
Help me!

1141
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:35,042
(rumbling)

1142
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:41,547
- Now you're my pig.

1143
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:44,301
It's the flesh
you loved so well.

1144
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:48,596
- Cory, I'm sorry.

1145
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:51,474
I love you.

1146
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:53,768
- I love you too.

1147
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:01,151
(rumbling)

1148
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:04,905
(laughing)

1149
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:12,537
If she's dead...

1150
01:28:13,831 --> 01:28:16,623
(rumbling)

1151
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:17,459
Dad?!

1152
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:20,794
- I always loved you, Cory.

1153
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:21,963
- No, dad.

1154
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:22,797
Don't!

1155
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:26,468
(dramatic music)

1156
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:37,478
Stop it!

1157
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,313
Stop it!

1158
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:41,816
(thudding)

1159
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:49,157
It won't work.

1160
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,494
I'm not afraid of you.

1161
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:55,997
You're the one who's terrified.

1162
01:28:55,998 --> 01:28:58,208
(rumbling)

1163
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,836
- I fear nothing from you.

1164
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:04,546
- Another lie.

1165
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:07,508
You're terrified of us
because we're alive.

1166
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:08,510
We can feel.

1167
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,512
You're only a shadow.

1168
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:16,350
You hide behind your cheap magic
tricks because you're dead.

1169
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,227
God changed you into a snake

1170
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:21,230
and a chicken shit
at the same time.

1171
01:29:21,231 --> 01:29:24,358
- I don't need magic
to take your soul.

1172
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,653
(grunting)

1173
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:28,362
(thudding)

1174
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:31,074
(dramatic music)

1175
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:38,622
And when you die, I
will have your woman.

1176
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:42,794
Sure it will be fun (mumbling)
how she will beg for death.

1177
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:48,632
(sizzling)

1178
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,885
(groaning)

1179
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:58,393
- Cory.

1180
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:02,064
Cory.

1181
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,692
(grunting)

1182
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,489
(whooshing)

1183
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:15,577
(thudding)

1184
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:17,286
- Get the diary.

1185
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:18,956
Read the last spell.

1186
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:24,169
Do it now!

1187
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:27,254
(thudding)

1188
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,256
- We call upon the
power of Light.

1189
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:31,300
Drive this evil (mumbling).

1190
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:33,552
Set it back into the
darkness from where it came.

1191
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:35,429
We call on the God of Light.

1192
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:38,765
Bring this abomination
(mumbling).

1193
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:39,641
- No!

1194
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:40,726
- They will be done.

1195
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:42,103
- No!

1196
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:44,314
(bursting)

1197
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:52,739
(groaning)

1198
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:20,350
(house exploding)

1199
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:36,491
(dramatic music)

1200
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:19,867
- Cory, you're human again.

1201
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:23,829
Is it over?

1202
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:25,332
Is it really over?

1203
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:08,082
(birds chirping)

1204
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:33,858
(knocking on door)

1205
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:39,697
Hello?

1206
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:41,616
Hello!

1207
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:44,451
Harriet?

1208
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:47,413
- [Harriet] Elaine, is that you?

1209
01:33:47,414 --> 01:33:49,415
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

1210
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:50,249
My uncle, he was--

1211
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:51,917
- I know.

1212
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:53,586
- Elaine, come here.

1213
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:59,675
I have a surprise for you.

1214
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:01,134
- That's okay.

1215
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:03,763
We have a surprise for you too.

1216
01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:08,642
(screaming)

1217
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:10,895
(rumbling)

1218
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:19,654
(car engine roaring)

1219
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:34,711
(growling)

1220
01:34:36,838 --> 01:34:40,091
(dramatic music)
