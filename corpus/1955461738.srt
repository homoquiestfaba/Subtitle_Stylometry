00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:49,858
In 1917,
I signed up to fight the Huns in France.

3
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:04,578
Good men died all around me.
I saw no reason for it.

4
00:01:09,574 --> 00:01:16,507
The rules we lived by were lies and they
didn't apply to those who made them.

5
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:20,402
I swore If I made it home...

6
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:23,102
...I would never follow orders again.

7
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:30,684
I left a soldier I came home an outlaw.

8
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:43,939
I lived one robbery to the next.

9
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:47,817
A good day was filled by sleep...

10
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:51,317
...and a good night spent running
too hard to look back.

11
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:57,531
I lived that life for 10 years...

12
00:01:57,658 --> 00:02:00,525
...until it caught up to me.

13
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:07,359
It all started with an inside man.

14
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:21,740
The Albert White crew was playing
a high stakes poker game...

15
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,684
...and our inside man left
the back door open for us.

16
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,577
Where's the fuckin' money?
You know whose fuckin' place this is?

17
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:39,744
Give it! Well, you know whose fuckin'
card game this is, you fuckin' dunce?

18
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:41,244
You heard of Albert White?
Keep talkin', bimbo!

19
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,460
Miss, come here!

20
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:49,335
Do you want a drink to go with your robbery?
No, just the money, put it in the bag.

21
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,275
What's your name? Emma Gould.

22
00:02:57,808 --> 00:03:00,674
What's yours?
You gonna put a sock in me mouth?

23
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:03,730
That's right. A sock? In my mouth?

24
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:07,714
Never been used before
and I wouldn't lie to you.

25
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:09,414
That's what all the liars say.

26
00:03:09,614 --> 00:03:11,214
Open up.

27
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:21,772
Great!

28
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:25,031
Our boy's here. Let's go!

29
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:28,786
You got some balls.

30
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,681
Slow down and stop driving
like we did something. Relax

31
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:40,522
Made out pretty good.
It was a nice hit. Yeah, it's all mine.

32
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,355
Very funny. Look forward! Drice the car!

33
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:55,908
Good afternoon, I'm Albert White.

34
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,709
You must be Joe.

35
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,876
Coughlin.
Goodood to put a face to the name.

36
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,696
This is Brandon Lumas...friend of mine.
How are you?

37
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,824
You're too smart for the stuff
you been pullin'.

38
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:17,876
Nickel and dimin' with two dumb guineas.

39
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:21,393
They're your friends but
they're stupid and they're Whops.

40
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:23,553
And they won't live to see forty.

41
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:30,325
Take your time.

42
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,103
But you can't work on your own.

43
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,410
Not in this town.

44
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:40,506
Albert was rounding up the troops.

45
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:42,816
They was a war going on...

46
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:45,709
...over rum.
Dermott, go and have a word.

47
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:48,588
Albert White ran the Irish mob...

48
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:56,323
...and Maso Pescatore ran the Italians.

49
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:58,329
It was tit for tat.

50
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:08,305
The daedliest year
in the history of Boston.

51
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:17,452
White's gang set fire to rum trucks.

52
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:22,084
And a guy on Maso's payroll went home
with a girl no one had seen before.

53
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:29,712
The winner...disorder mess.

54
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:40,246
I wanted nothing to do with
Albert White and his war.

55
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:42,498
But I didn't have a choice.

56
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:46,571
His girlfriend was my inside man.

57
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:56,644
And I was in love with her.

58
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,291
He'd kill her if she tried to leave him
and he'd kill us both...

59
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,591
...10 times over if he found out
we were together.

60
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,520
But we were in love and we were stupid.

61
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:27,033
And every time he was out of town,
we were together.

62
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:35,215
The fit was perfect.

63
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:00,220
Mind if I join you?

64
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,520
Sorry father,
but I've been waiting for someone. No!

65
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:07,488
Emma, this is my father, Tom Coughlin.

66
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,431
Dad, this is my friend Emma Gould.

67
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:14,365
Pleasure, Ms. Gould Mind if I sit down?

68
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,187
Where are you from, Miss Gould?
Dorchester.

69
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:27,421
No, I meant before.
You're clearly Irish.

70
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:31,388
On my mother's favor from Cork. Really?
What's her maiden name?

71
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:32,669
I don't know.

72
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,903
You don't know?
She died. She's dead, me mamso

73
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:42,915
So, what is it you do?

74
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,955
It's a really swank place this,
isn't it?

75
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:51,049
I know well how my son earns a living.

76
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:53,426
I can only assume that if
you've come into contact with him.

77
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:56,199
It was either during a crime
or in an establishment...

78
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:58,399
...populated by rough characters.

79
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,370
Are my questions making
you feel uncomfortable?

80
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:06,098
I don't know what you're on about...

81
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:08,464
...and to be honest,
I don't really care.

82
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,973
I'm on about you being the type of
lassie who consorts with criminals...

83
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:14,895
The fact that the criminal is my son
isn't the issue.

84
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:17,669
It is that my son is still my son...

85
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:21,560
and I have feelings that cause me
to question the wisdom of...

86
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:25,844
...consorting with the type of woman
who knowingly consorts with criminals.

87
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:29,891
Did you follow all that?
Enough, Dad. Enough, ok?

88
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,500
My uncle mentioned a copper
on his payroll, name of Coughlin.

89
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,590
Is that you?

90
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,285
This uncle would be your Uncle Robert?

91
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:43,651
Who everyone knows as Bobo?

92
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:48,280
The police officer you
refer to is Elmer Conklin.

93
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:53,834
He stays in...He collects shakedowns from
illegal establishments such as Bobo's.

94
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:58,317
I rarely get out of Dorchester Still,
as Deputy Superintendent...

95
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:00,619
I'd be happy to take
a greater interest in BoBo.

96
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:07,250
I need to powder.

97
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,267
Was that necessary?

98
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,681
I didn't start the fight, Joseph...

99
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:20,981
...so don't criticize me
for how I finished it.

100
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:24,827
I've been a police officer for 37 years...

101
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:27,127
...and I've learned one thing above all.
Do you know what it is?

102
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:30,842
It's gonna to be another
yarn from the old country. No.

103
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:34,155
What you put out in the world
will always come back to you.

104
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,913
But never how you predict.

105
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,867
I'm sure it doesn't.

106
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:43,118
Unearned confidence of that
about which one is ignorant...

107
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,110
...always has the brightest glow.

108
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:48,338
I think I've heard enough.

109
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:52,025
She's quite easy on the eyes.

110
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:53,856
Yeah, she is.

111
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:59,449
Apart from that, I fail to see what
you see in her. She's from Dorchester

112
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:03,547
Well, that doesn't help. Her father's
a pimp, her uncle killed two men.

113
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:06,299
I could overlook all that,
Joseph, if she wasn't...

114
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:08,845
She just doesn't pretend
to be something she's not.

115
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:12,154
Maybe she's just asleep.

116
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,106
Thanks for stopping by.

117
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,002
Maybe you should climb
under his covers tonight. What?

118
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:20,916
He looked at me like I'm trash!

119
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:23,318
We're not people.

120
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,707
We're just the Goulds from Dorchester.

121
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:28,414
We tat the lace for your fuckin'
carpets. Jesus.

122
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:30,348
Don't fuckin' touch me!

123
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:33,002
My whole life,
I got the high hat and the icy mitt...

124
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:35,376
...from people like your father.

125
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,517
We're not less than you.

126
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,020
I never said you were.

127
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Oh, well, he did. Fuck him! Ok?

128
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:44,277
I love you.

129
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:47,622
We can glow so easy.

130
00:10:50,712 --> 00:10:52,212
I know.

131
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:56,617
Fuck!

132
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:03,178
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:05,261
I'm sorry.

134
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:06,861
Let go.

135
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:18,423
Spare two bits?

136
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:20,842
Thanks a lot.

137
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:24,972
Joe Coughlin. Got an invitation.

138
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,420
I gotta check you.

139
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:34,009
Go ahead.

140
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Joseph? Joe Coughlin, yeah.

141
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:51,182
Do you know who I am?

142
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,211
I know enough to show up
here when I'm asked.

143
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,951
My name is Maso Pescatore.

144
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:07,584
I run the North End and liquor
coming up from Florida.

145
00:12:08,638 --> 00:12:14,384
I'm the man with the power
of other mens' lives in my hands.

146
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,101
but the truth is...

147
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:21,116
...I'm just a simple wop
from the old country.

148
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:25,023
Today,
my only true rival is Albert White.

149
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,925
When that is no longer the case...

150
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:34,727
we can see an end to the fighting
that has plagued this town.

151
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:40,793
Well, I got no beef with you.

152
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:44,839
But I don't truck with gangsters,
not even a sheik like you.

153
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:47,928
You do soup jobs and stickups...

154
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:51,323
...but you're not a gangster.

155
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:52,949
What does that make you?

156
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,039
I don't know.

157
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:57,404
An outlaw, I guess.
I just don't want any part of that life.

158
00:12:57,561 --> 00:13:02,494
How many things, good or bad, come to us
whether we ask for them or not.

159
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:07,303
For example, one of my men
saw you with a young lady...

160
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:12,183
Well, not so much a lady,
but a putana whose date is Albert White.

161
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:20,877
So, it no longer matters
so much what you want.

162
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:25,454
You're in this life...

163
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:28,303
and it can only end two ways.

164
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:32,170
One. You get to Albert
and put an end to him.

165
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:37,585
Two. I tell Albert about the girl
and he gets to you first.

166
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,378
Like I said...

167
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,340
I ain't a gangster.

168
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:49,297
I've done enough killin' in this life.

169
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:53,524
If you want to tell your enemy
some rumor you heard, go ahead.

170
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:58,025
If I kill Albert White, someone's just
going to jump up and take his place.

171
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,055
And I'll be married to the Pescatore mob
for the rest of my life.

172
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:07,505
I stopped kissing rings a long time ago.

173
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:11,865
Good afternoon.

174
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:21,564
Do you think he told Albert?

175
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:23,911
I'd be dead already. Christ!

176
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,832
We could leave.

177
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:31,150
Where would we go?

178
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,584
Somewhere warm.

179
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,429
My brother Danny lives in California.
Where?

180
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,467
I don't know.
I haven't talked to him for ten years.

181
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:45,813
He sent back a bunch of postcards sayin'
he was doing stunts, trying to be a writer.

182
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:50,084
God, I'd go to California. I don't know
much about honest work, I gotta tell you.

183
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:53,513
Well, who said anything
about honest work? Good!

184
00:14:53,713 --> 00:14:57,132
We do what we want to do,
go where we want to go.

185
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:01,228
Sleep by day.

186
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:09,434
I got a job in Lawrence on Saturday,
then I'll be free.

187
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:13,700
Free to leave? Yeah, free to leave.

188
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:20,170
I have to see you-know-who on Saturday.
Fuck you, no! That's the idea.

189
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:25,039
Oh, come on, what's the alternative?
You want to wind up in the...?

190
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:30,122
I'm supposed to meet him
at the Statler on Saturday.

191
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:34,051
Turns him on to see me
when his wife's on his arm.

192
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:38,576
After that,
he's going to Detroit for a week.

193
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:42,896
Will you clean yourself up
and get to the Statler by 7?

194
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,180
I think I can clean myself up
and get to the Statler by 7.

195
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:47,906
Shut up.

196
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:56,245
The Lawrence Bank job, we got
enough to get us to California on.

197
00:15:57,641 --> 00:16:00,241
It's true,
that's what I was thinkin' about.

198
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:07,638
Let's go!

199
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,879
What are you doing?

200
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:16,450
Start! Start!

201
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,270
Look out! Look out!

202
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,561
Fuck!

203
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:45,839
Watch out!

204
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,272
Get outa the way!

205
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,590
Fuck it!

206
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,910
Move! Get out of the fuckin' way!

207
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:03,482
What?

208
00:17:18,597 --> 00:17:20,097
God!

209
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:33,148
Come on! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Go!

210
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,254
Shit!

211
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,940
I walked half a mile,
stole a car in North Reading...

212
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,890
...and replaced it with a Dodge
I found in Summerville

213
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:07,891
I came back to my childhood home
and considered my options.

214
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,764
The story was in all the Late Editions.

215
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:21,097
The third dead cop was a trooper who
pulled someone over near the state forest.

216
00:20:23,116 --> 00:20:25,416
It had to be Dion.

217
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,186
Keep going!
There's a Service Elevator up here.

218
00:21:52,262 --> 00:21:56,195
I can't believe you came!
Where was I going to go?

219
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:59,886
I don't know. It's not what people do.
It's what I do.

220
00:22:05,763 --> 00:22:07,230
Shit, shit, shit!

221
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:25,879
Why you crying?

222
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:28,372
Because I love you.

223
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:31,396
Then smile. I can't.

224
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:31,990
I'm sure as you die, you'll
tell yourself you did it for love.

225
00:23:32,604 --> 00:23:36,371
No, you feel guilty about what you do.

226
00:23:37,522 --> 00:23:42,055
So you spend your life hoping
someone will punish you for your sins.

227
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:43,904
Well...

228
00:23:45,422 --> 00:23:48,355
Here I am. Joe, I'm so sorry!

229
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:54,907
She's sorry, we're all fuckin' sorry.
Take her out of here.

230
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:57,609
You said you wouldn't kill him Albert,
that was the deal!

231
00:23:57,694 --> 00:23:59,694
Don't worry.
I would never have brought him here...

232
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,259
I'm going to be humiliated by a whore?

233
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,680
Someone close to me says some...

234
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:13,180
...arsehole is puttin'
a hole into my fuckin' head...

235
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:19,034
You're lucky I didn't cut your tits off
and throw you in the fuckin' dump.

236
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,540
Take her to the car, Donny.
Sorry! Sorry!

237
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:27,901
Ah, it's ok.

238
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:30,786
You should be more worried
about what I'm going to do to you.

239
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,137
Don't kill her.

240
00:24:32,324 --> 00:24:35,724
What the fuck do you care?
She just sold you down the the river.

241
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:39,013
I wasn't honest.

242
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:41,450
I said if she delivered you to us,
I wouldn't kill you.

243
00:24:42,955 --> 00:24:46,989
But we both know I have to kill you,
don't we, Joe.

244
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:49,447
And then I'm going to kill her too.

245
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:03,064
Leave him, let's get out of here.

246
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:17,286
So you're a cop killer now, Joseph?

247
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:18,993
I didn't kill anybody.

248
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,793
Looks like your friends were about to
take you on the dead man's drive.

249
00:25:24,295 --> 00:25:25,895
Dad, they're going to kill her.

250
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:29,714
Well, we won't kill you, Joseph...

251
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,210
...but some of my coworkers
would like a word.

252
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,582
Please, Dad! Oh, I'm going to kill him!

253
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:41,022
She's in the car with Donnie Gishler!

254
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:59,459
I don't know what his skull's
made of but it isn't bone.

255
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:01,962
In a coma two weeks.
No cranial bleeding.

256
00:26:02,014 --> 00:26:06,681
No loss of memory or speech disabilty.
His nose and half his ribs are broken.

257
00:26:07,284 --> 00:26:10,150
It'll be a long time before he doesn't
see any blood in the bowl. Go on in.

258
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,014
Dad, where is she?

259
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,310
Did they find her?

260
00:26:19,384 --> 00:26:21,610
We followed her and Donnie Gishler.

261
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,710
His car went off the road
and into the ocean at 9:20.

262
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,885
An officer from Beverly dove in lookin'
for them.

263
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,200
Ended up in the hospital
for a week with hypothermia.

264
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:39,505
She was Albert White's girl.
She betrayed you.

265
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:42,649
She did...

266
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,516
And?

267
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:48,480
I'm crazy about her. Crazy isn't love.

268
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:51,599
I saw your marriage for 18 years.
It wasn't love.

269
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,793
No, no it wasn't.

270
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:03,029
Anyway, she's gone. She's as
dead as your mother, God rest her..

271
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,143
They caught up with Paolo in St. Albans,
about 10 miles from the border.

272
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,694
A number of officers gave chase.

273
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:17,094
He was struck by at least 14 rounds...

274
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:18,699
...low for a cop killer.

275
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:25,056
What about Dion?
It's possible he made the border.

276
00:27:42,848 --> 00:27:46,182
You were the child that was supposed to fix
the distance between me and your mother.

277
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:48,113
were you aware of that?

278
00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:53,161
I was aware of the distance.

279
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,953
People don't fix each other.

280
00:27:58,824 --> 00:28:02,324
They never become anything
but what they've always been.

281
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:06,249
All we get sometimes is a little luck.

282
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:12,593
Do not waste your's
pining for a dead girl.

283
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:14,467
You make your own luck.

284
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:17,734
Sometimes, sometimes it makes you.

285
00:28:26,814 --> 00:28:30,747
If he pleads guilty, I can take
the death penalty off the table.

286
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:40,918
3 years out, 20 probation.

287
00:28:41,313 --> 00:28:44,580
Three years?
There are 3 dead police officers.

288
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,457
And he didn't kill them.

289
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:52,753
He may be the son
of the Deputy Superintendent...

290
00:28:52,953 --> 00:28:56,209
...but he will long know the
inside of the Charlestown Prison.

291
00:28:56,295 --> 00:29:00,024
I promise you. Chief Inspector,
I was demoted yesterday.

292
00:29:00,594 --> 00:29:04,061
Then we can leave unsaid the notion
I was going to dispell for you.

293
00:29:05,465 --> 00:29:08,465
I have no illusions.
I'm a practical man.

294
00:29:12,496 --> 00:29:15,363
The photograph is of a door
to a rowhouse in Back Bay...

295
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:18,363
...where you have been keeping time
with a young man of Mexican descent.

296
00:29:19,112 --> 00:29:23,979
If you move the location of your
liasons, I will know within the hour.

297
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:33,933
Let me see what I can do.

298
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:37,221
Seeing what you can do
is of little interest to me.

299
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:39,940
<i>Federal Prison Of Charleston</i>

300
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:53,826
I pled guilty to
abetting armed robbery...

301
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:58,183
...and was given 3 years and 4 months
in the Charlestown prison.

302
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,794
If my father had lived 2 more weeks...

303
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,413
I could have said goodbye.

304
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,415
I got one guaranteed life...

305
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:30,235
...and I was going to live it.

306
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:37,285
I would use Maso and his
hatred for Albert to get me started.

307
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:38,914
Funny, how things change.

308
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:43,135
What happened to all the talk
about not being a gangster?

309
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:46,461
Now you come to me looking for a job.

310
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:48,061
I got nothin' left.

311
00:31:49,048 --> 00:31:50,781
I don'tt want to be a gangster.

312
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,370
But I'll work for one if I
can get to Albert White.

313
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:58,686
From what I heard in prison,
you're still the man to see about that.

314
00:31:58,831 --> 00:32:02,231
We ran Albert White
out of Boston like you heard.

315
00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:06,799
Now he's making a run to our
rum operation in central Florida.

316
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:08,254
He won't stand by.

317
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:11,986
It's true,
I could use someone who is committed...

318
00:32:12,086 --> 00:32:14,286
...to putting an end to Mr. White.

319
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:15,667
You found your man right here.

320
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:18,191
Your duty would always have to be...

321
00:32:18,195 --> 00:32:20,591
...to the Pescatore Family first,
then yourself second.

322
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,247
Can you live with that? It sounds fair.

323
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,503
I just need one guy,
Dion Bartolo from my old crew...

324
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:27,703
...to help me go down there and set up.

325
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:30,811
It's good to have someone you can trust.

326
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:36,998
It's hot down there. I don't mind hot.

327
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,156
You ain't never felt hot like this one.

328
00:32:40,206 --> 00:32:44,039
If it's not as wet as in Charlestown,
I could use the change.

329
00:32:44,098 --> 00:32:47,698
Then get the narcotics running,
starting in Tampa.

330
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:49,801
Frank Ormino runs Tampa.

331
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:51,861
He's gonna decide
he doesn't need the headache.

332
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:55,852
When's he gonna decide that?
10 minutes after you get there.

333
00:32:56,036 --> 00:32:59,136
I see, so I gotta make you
and me equal partners?

334
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,813
No! Frank Ormino's an equal partner.

335
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:06,543
But look what's gonna to happen to him.
I guess I work cheap.

336
00:33:07,683 --> 00:33:09,983
Can you tolerate
an Irishman in your crew?

337
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:13,142
This is America. I've lived worse.

338
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:22,329
<i>Ybor City Station Florida</i>

339
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:32,797
I realized it's not
enough to break the rules.

340
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:37,578
You have to be strong enough
to make your own.

341
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:03,434
Joseph!

342
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:09,480
How ya doin'? You! Look at you!

343
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:13,349
Hey, sorry about your father.
Yeah, sorry about your brother.

344
00:34:13,705 --> 00:34:15,604
Thank you, thank you

345
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:18,305
Listen, when Lefty Downer
found me in Montreal...

346
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,492
...told me the Pescatores wanted
me to come work for them...

347
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:22,807
I thought it was a straight bamboozle.

348
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:24,344
Then I thought...

349
00:34:24,352 --> 00:34:28,673
...if anyone could charm the devil,
it's my old partner. Look at this!

350
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:31,796
Holy shit! Would you look at this?

351
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,647
Here, after you.
Get the fuck outta here!

352
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:37,286
I work for you now, Boss Joe Coughlin.

353
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:41,492
Reach under the seat
and you'll find a friend.

354
00:34:47,288 --> 00:34:48,488
Welcome to Ybor.

355
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:49,892
The Harlem of Tampa.

356
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:54,378
The gods built this place.
What you're smellin' now...

357
00:34:54,415 --> 00:34:56,315
...probably bolos or empanadas.

358
00:34:56,823 --> 00:34:58,790
The rest of Tampa leaves Ybor alone.

359
00:34:59,142 --> 00:35:00,309
As far as they're concerned...

360
00:35:00,374 --> 00:35:02,309
...we're a bunch of dirty
Spics and Whops and...

361
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,909
...we can fuck off and
do what we need to do...

362
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:05,209
...as long as we leave them alone.

363
00:35:05,293 --> 00:35:06,560
You'd think we could all get along...

364
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,160
...but it don't work out that way.

365
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:13,023
The Italians and the Cubans
keep to themselves.

366
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:15,546
But the Cubans, they hate the Spaniards.

367
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,046
And the Spaniards look at all
Cubans like they're uppity Coons...

368
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:21,225
...who forgot their place since
America freed them in '98.

369
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:24,788
The Cubans and the Spanish,
they look down on the Puerto Ricans...

370
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:27,588
...and everyone, I mean everyone,
shits on the Dominicans.

371
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,258
The Italians only respect you
if you came off the boat.

372
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,558
How you doing, Laney?

373
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:34,324
And the white people think anyone
gives a shit what they think.

374
00:35:35,586 --> 00:35:37,086
You're a fuckin' piece of work.

375
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:55,203
Port of Tampa!

376
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:04,183
Who is it? Fireplace..

377
00:36:13,678 --> 00:36:15,078
Thanks, JT. No worries.

378
00:36:16,776 --> 00:36:20,709
There is a whole network of tunnels
like this underneath the city.

379
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:25,035
Who owns this warehouse?
Frank Ormino did.

380
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,720
What do you mean Ormino did?

381
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:29,614
Ormino sprung a few leaks the other day.

382
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,037
That was quick. Look at this over here.

383
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:37,354
The best money can buy.

384
00:36:37,444 --> 00:36:39,977
You gotta keep it at 186 Fahrenheit.

385
00:36:41,236 --> 00:36:43,436
Yeah, these babies never lie.

386
00:36:43,845 --> 00:36:47,111
Try to keep people from dying
when they drink your hootch.

387
00:36:47,143 --> 00:36:48,743
Made a lot of toilet booze in prison,

388
00:36:48,856 --> 00:36:51,189
...looks to me like you're
missing two key ingredients.

389
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:53,149
Which are? People and glasses.

390
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:55,716
Yeah, we got a problem. Why?

391
00:36:56,024 --> 00:36:58,224
Our distributor...
he's been comin' up empty.

392
00:36:58,324 --> 00:36:59,824
What is this?

393
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:02,102
The boats have been sinkin'
What's his name?

394
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:03,187
Gary L. Smith.

395
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,004
Gary Elsmith.

396
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:07,541
No, Gary L. Smith

397
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:09,067
It's a middle initial. I don't know...

398
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:11,467
...he wants people to use it.
It's a Southern thing.

399
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:14,856
Not just an asshole thing? Both!

400
00:37:18,024 --> 00:37:19,424
Thank you, Miss Roe.

401
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:21,786
You must be Maso's new find.

402
00:37:22,592 --> 00:37:23,592
Well, I guess, somethin' like that.

403
00:37:24,683 --> 00:37:26,092
How ya doin'?

404
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:30,306
So what brings you by?

405
00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:33,536
I've been asked to take over
Frank Ormino's affairs.

406
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:36,527
Hope that's not permanent! No offense.

407
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,540
None taken. Why is that?

408
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,277
Folks like dealing with who they know...

409
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,957
...and nobody knows you.

410
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,294
I see. Well, what would you suggest?

411
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,438
I have no ambitions for it but...

412
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:51,781
...to keep continuity...
...instead of doin' it for a term.

413
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:55,107
Well, we're mostly concerned with
why the last 3 supply runs were hit.

414
00:37:55,216 --> 00:37:58,116
Well, that's the Cubans.
Then let's just go to a new supplier.

415
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,776
It's not that simple. Why not?

416
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,706
Well, because they're all paying
tribute to the Suarez family.

417
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:07,804
That's the Cubans that are all
down in that club on 7th, right?

418
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,504
We're going to need to
talk to them soon.

419
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:16,318
I'm afraid you don't understand
how things are done here.

420
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,823
I deal with Mr. Suarez and his sister.

421
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:29,276
If you want, I'm sure we can arrange
a table by tomorrow night, 9 o'clock.

422
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:30,571
Great!

423
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:34,265
Now, Gary L., tell me this.
Do you work directly for Albert White?

424
00:38:34,337 --> 00:38:37,004
Or is there some intermediary
I should know about as well?

425
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,681
What? We marked your bottles.

426
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:41,784
You what?
If you distilled it, we marked it.

427
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:45,012
And all these runs that
were supposedly lost at sea...

428
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:48,112
somehow made their way
into Albert White's speakeasies.

429
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,410
Can you explain that?

430
00:38:50,515 --> 00:38:51,982
No, I don't understand.

431
00:38:52,404 --> 00:38:55,204
Dion drove me by your house
on the way over here.

432
00:38:55,221 --> 00:38:56,288
You got a lovely place.

433
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,488
You're gonna have
to bag up all that shit...

434
00:38:58,508 --> 00:39:00,288
and send it to wherever
it is you're going.

435
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,386
Where am I goin'? Are you fuckin' her?

436
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:05,929
What? Who? Miss Roe.

437
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:07,465
What?

438
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,765
He's fuckin' her!
Without question, definitely.

439
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:12,808
Aw, c'mon! Afternoon taste of Miss Roe?

440
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:17,309
Sugar in the mornin', sugar in...whatever.
I don't care what, who you fuck...

441
00:39:17,324 --> 00:39:21,291
Here's some tickets.
This is the 11 o'clock Seaboard tonight.

442
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:25,194
I don't care who you take with you
but you gotta be on that train.

443
00:39:25,894 --> 00:39:29,646
Wait a minute! Wait a minute, gentlemen.
come on, a second here.

444
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:30,916
Look, if you don't do the whole thing...

445
00:39:31,116 --> 00:39:33,416
I can bounce your head off the
floor like a fuckin' bowling ball...

446
00:39:33,616 --> 00:39:34,716
...but let's just make it easy.

447
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:37,431
Put yourself on that train, Gary L...

448
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:40,194
Or we're gonna have to put you under it.

449
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:42,059
Listen, I think...can we...?

450
00:39:42,378 --> 00:39:46,256
Oh, no...c'mon, fellas...gentlemen...
Let's just sit and visit with each other.

451
00:39:46,736 --> 00:39:47,969
Is this...?

452
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:51,161
Mr. Cou...

453
00:39:54,135 --> 00:39:57,812
<i>Francis Ormino found shot
Police seek witnesses</i>

454
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:04,503
When did you mark the bottles?
Frick are you talking about?

455
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:07,051
You been with me every
second since I been here...

456
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:08,451
...you see me mark any bottles?

457
00:40:08,476 --> 00:40:10,946
No,
that's how come I know it was bullshit!

458
00:40:58,636 --> 00:41:01,069
Mr. Suarez, nice to see you.

459
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:04,245
Let me introduce you to Joe Coughlin.

460
00:41:04,302 --> 00:41:05,902
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

461
00:41:07,677 --> 00:41:09,277
Have a drink.

462
00:41:10,088 --> 00:41:11,088
Thank you very much.

463
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,235
I never agreed with the Spanish...

464
00:41:14,236 --> 00:41:16,036
...that the lighter rums were superior.

465
00:41:16,465 --> 00:41:18,965
Of course, we Cubans went along...

466
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,950
because or our obsession that
light is greater in all things.

467
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:25,298
Dion, Joseph! My sister, Graciela.
Nice to meet you.

468
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,950
We've met.
My mistake. Of course, we've met.

469
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,219
Yes, we have.

470
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,312
How you doin'?
Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you.

471
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:35,749
God, this rum is incredible!

472
00:41:36,592 --> 00:41:38,592
It would be nice if
we could sell it up North.

473
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:40,555
When your country
treats you like adults.

474
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,220
Oh, I'd even be out of a job.

475
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:44,987
Esteban took those.

476
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:48,582
The working people of Miami. Very good!

477
00:41:48,736 --> 00:41:52,336
It is a hobby. Perhaps I photograph
you someday, Mr. Coughlin?

478
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:54,756
I don't know about that. The fewer
pictures of me out there, the better.

479
00:41:54,956 --> 00:41:56,356
I'm with the Indians on that one.

480
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:00,818
Speaking of captured souls...

481
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:07,523
I am told that Mr Gary L. Smith was
seen boarding a Seaboard Limited.

482
00:42:07,606 --> 00:42:10,806
with his wife in one Pullman
and that puta maestra in the other.

483
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:12,467
Well, you never know.

484
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:15,646
Sometimes a change of scenery
can do a man good.

485
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:18,731
Is that why you're here in Ybor?
A little change of scenery?

486
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,943
I'm here in Ybor to distill and
distribute the demon rum.

487
00:42:22,037 --> 00:42:25,371
A task which is made more difficult
by your erratic import schedules.

488
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,110
We don't control the tides.

489
00:42:27,175 --> 00:42:29,310
The tides would be fine
if we were in Miami.

490
00:42:29,394 --> 00:42:31,594
We know nothing of the boats to Miami.

491
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:35,112
Senor Famosa assures me
the tides have been calm all summer.

492
00:42:37,446 --> 00:42:39,346
When you say Senor Famosa's name...

493
00:42:39,532 --> 00:42:41,832
...so we worry you may
overtake our supply routes.

494
00:42:42,866 --> 00:42:45,166
No, I use Senor Famosa's name...

495
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,047
...to reassure you that from now on,
you can work directly with me...

496
00:42:49,077 --> 00:42:51,277
...and you can charge me a higher price.

497
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:52,971
What do we get in return?

498
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:57,247
You get access to Ormino's cops
and judges, which we now control.

499
00:42:57,288 --> 00:43:00,388
Most of whom wouldn't do business
with you otherwise because you're Cuban.

500
00:43:00,589 --> 00:43:02,489
And you would want
exclusive access to our molasses?

501
00:43:02,696 --> 00:43:05,196
Nope. You just can't sell
to the White operation.

502
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,300
Albert White is a paying customer.

503
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,252
We've never had a problem with him.

504
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:11,339
I know Albert White.

505
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:15,219
I thought you might like to deal with
someone who treated you like a human being.

506
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:17,995
It is possible this
will bring bloodshed.

507
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,695
This will definitely bring bloodshed.

508
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,767
These are very favorable terms.

509
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,676
Albert White is what we get.

510
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:36,228
The local sheriff wanted to see us.

511
00:43:36,285 --> 00:43:37,985
Apparently it was a custom down there...

512
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:39,985
...to talk about how
you were going to break the law...

513
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,450
...before you did it.

514
00:43:41,504 --> 00:43:45,304
What kind of guy is the Chief?
Well, he's a cop, so he's an asshole.

515
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:47,649
Beyond that, he's ok.

516
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,203
What are you doing?
Don't fuck with the guy's stuff!

517
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:59,304
The Sheriff's gonna come in and find some
dago goin' through his fuckin' papers.

518
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:05,131
Hey, this is Vegas right here.

519
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:12,782
Please, sit down.

520
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:22,704
I won't insult you by...

521
00:44:23,551 --> 00:44:26,251
...asking the nature of your business...

522
00:44:27,124 --> 00:44:29,924
...so you won't have
to insult me by lying.

523
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:33,047
Is that fair?

524
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:35,739
Sounds fair to me.

525
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:39,288
Is it true you're a
police captain's son?

526
00:44:39,372 --> 00:44:40,846
Yes, sir!

527
00:44:40,953 --> 00:44:43,570
You serve overseas? France.

528
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:46,778
Tell it to the Marines.

529
00:44:46,813 --> 00:44:50,011
Yes, sir. They told it to us.

530
00:44:50,096 --> 00:44:53,167
I was a soldier and then a US Marshall.

531
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:56,692
I killed 7 men in my lifetime.

532
00:44:56,898 --> 00:45:01,288
Truth be told,
their faces haunt me most nights.

533
00:45:08,662 --> 00:45:11,877
You keep your business
north of Second...

534
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:16,058
...south of 27th and east of Nebraska.

535
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,872
You and I will have little
in the way of discord.

536
00:45:20,907 --> 00:45:22,140
Sounds good.

537
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:25,192
I know we live in a fallen world...

538
00:45:26,148 --> 00:45:29,541
...but just because I breathe corrupt air...

539
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:32,811
...rub elbows with corrupt men...

540
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,807
Never make the mistake of
thinking that I am corruptible.

541
00:45:40,247 --> 00:45:42,188
I won't make that mistake.

542
00:45:45,255 --> 00:45:48,642
Oh, I'm sorry. Thought you were alone.

543
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,958
That's alright, Loretta.
These gentlemen were just leaving.

544
00:45:51,993 --> 00:45:53,790
Honey, your manners.

545
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,939
Oh, yes, Father.

546
00:45:57,985 --> 00:46:00,041
Miss Loretta Figgis.

547
00:46:00,237 --> 00:46:02,409
Pleased to meet you, Miss.
I'm Joe Coughlin.

548
00:46:02,444 --> 00:46:07,630
Dion Bartolo. Loretta is taking
the train on a long journey today.

549
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,364
It's goin' around.

550
00:46:09,581 --> 00:46:12,128
Is that right?

551
00:46:12,163 --> 00:46:14,465
She gonna be a star in Hollywood.

552
00:46:14,549 --> 00:46:17,136
It's only a screen test, Daddy.
No.

553
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:21,524
A screen agent came here
and picked out a few girls.

554
00:46:22,477 --> 00:46:25,035
My brother's out there.
Your brother's in Hollywood?

555
00:46:25,189 --> 00:46:27,291
He's a stuntman, I'm told.

556
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,941
Fallin' off horses.

557
00:46:29,655 --> 00:46:32,783
Pleased to meet you, Miss. Chief.

558
00:46:33,577 --> 00:46:34,910
Gentlemen.

559
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:38,251
You sure you don't want a banana?
No, it's alright.

560
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:42,339
You can't get fruit like this in Boston.
I know, it looks good.

561
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:45,003
Watch!
There she is.

562
00:46:45,038 --> 00:46:47,643
Just watch this! Yeah?

563
00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:53,730
Hello! Good afternoon! How are you?

564
00:46:53,765 --> 00:46:56,367
I'm well. How are you?
Excellent!

565
00:46:56,902 --> 00:47:00,909
You and your brother
come to any decision on...

566
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:05,528
Not yet. We're still considering,
Mr. Coughlin. Okay.

567
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,031
Yes, it would be quite an upheaval for us.

568
00:47:09,066 --> 00:47:12,533
I understand. Of course.
We don't make changes easily.

569
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,539
Well, there's all kind of change.

570
00:47:15,574 --> 00:47:20,269
Where I was recently staying,
we used to play chess a lot...

571
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:24,252
...this is the kind of change where you
get your pawn to the end of the board...

572
00:47:24,352 --> 00:47:27,920
...and it changes into a queen.
There's not a lot to think about here.

573
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,944
Yes. I do play chess.
You do?

574
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:33,017
My father taught me.

575
00:47:33,162 --> 00:47:34,756
What you might do well
to remember is that...

576
00:47:34,856 --> 00:47:37,256
...the pawn and the king
end up in the same box...

577
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,932
...at the end of the game.

578
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,796
Man! It's not about the end.

579
00:47:43,009 --> 00:47:45,517
It's about when you're playin' the game.

580
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:48,392
You hang me upside down
and light me on fire at the end.

581
00:47:48,476 --> 00:47:50,310
I want to win while I'm playin'.

582
00:47:54,694 --> 00:47:57,418
I have feeling you win
most of the games you play.

583
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,166
Not yet...but I plan on it.

584
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,742
Why don't you join me?

585
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:14,300
You know, some people say
that liquor is only a side business.

586
00:49:14,808 --> 00:49:16,112
Is that so?

587
00:49:16,147 --> 00:49:20,773
In fact, I heard rumors you
give most of your money away.

588
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:22,852
A lot of it in Cuba.

589
00:49:23,946 --> 00:49:25,506
Anything that's foolish?

590
00:49:25,823 --> 00:49:29,087
Not foolish,
Just not my cause, that's all.

591
00:49:29,745 --> 00:49:31,332
What is your cause?

592
00:49:31,665 --> 00:49:33,705
Distribution of Demon Rum.

593
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,730
And no man should rule
another man's life.

594
00:49:40,429 --> 00:49:43,332
If you corner the rum market,
you will be a king.

595
00:49:44,766 --> 00:49:46,602
I'll still have to deal
with Albert White.

596
00:49:46,686 --> 00:49:49,443
But how will you hold the
power, once you have it?

597
00:49:49,527 --> 00:49:51,925
Why, you don't think I'm strong enough?

598
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:54,807
I don't know if you're cruel enough.

599
00:49:56,323 --> 00:50:00,463
And if you are, that would be very sad.

600
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,183
Powerful men don't have to be cruel.

601
00:50:03,964 --> 00:50:05,610
But they usually are.

602
00:50:07,383 --> 00:50:10,803
Tell me something, do you think there
is such a thing as an noble man?

603
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:15,039
I have nothing against noble men.
They just rarely live past 40.

604
00:50:17,146 --> 00:50:19,109
My father died for Cuba.

605
00:50:19,986 --> 00:50:22,020
My mother died of a broken heart.

606
00:50:23,655 --> 00:50:25,449
He would often tell us,
Esteban and I...

607
00:50:25,533 --> 00:50:29,747
"You can not truly live unless there
is something for which you would die."

608
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,979
Sounds like a good man.

609
00:50:34,591 --> 00:50:35,965
He was.

610
00:51:32,129 --> 00:51:34,993
We will never be lovers.
No?

611
00:51:37,554 --> 00:51:39,183
Why's that?

612
00:51:41,936 --> 00:51:43,561
We will not be lovers.

613
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,545
<i>We cornered the rum market
and lived like kings</i>

614
00:52:55,126 --> 00:52:56,419
Fast. Come on. Hurry up.

615
00:52:59,508 --> 00:53:02,365
<i>Banks collapsed. Jobs dried up.</i>

616
00:53:02,565 --> 00:53:07,465
<i>But vice, it seemed,
was Depression-proof</i>

617
00:53:08,392 --> 00:53:09,479
Okay. Let's go.

618
00:53:14,153 --> 00:53:18,358
<i>The Suarez-Coughlin partnership
created a rare stability.</i>

619
00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:40,603
<i>We paid off Albert's guys in Central
Florida to put down their guns.</i>

620
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:46,275
<i>So when Albert wanted to hit us
he had to use his Miami crews.</i>

621
00:53:50,846 --> 00:53:53,456
<i>When they showed up,
we bushwhacked them.</i>

622
00:54:12,862 --> 00:54:15,408
<i>Albert was living on the run in Miami...</i>

623
00:54:15,488 --> 00:54:19,413
<i>and there wasn't a speak in Central
or North Florida we didn't sell to.</i>

624
00:54:52,752 --> 00:54:55,602
Send them in there,
put this shit out. Alright.

625
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:00,116
Get on the floor!

626
00:55:00,151 --> 00:55:01,477
Get down! Now!

627
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:03,767
Get on the floor!
Get down!

628
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,967
Get down! Get Down!

629
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:13,673
This is what happens when
Catholics try to sell liquor down here.

630
00:55:13,757 --> 00:55:16,468
The guy's name is R.D. Pruitt.

631
00:55:16,503 --> 00:55:18,867
Well, we better go find him.

632
00:55:18,973 --> 00:55:20,940
He is in the Clan.
So what?

633
00:55:20,975 --> 00:55:24,499
So are 5 million other guys in this country.
The clan has a lot of fuckin' juice.

634
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:26,571
They're inbreds with
4th grade educations.

635
00:55:26,606 --> 00:55:28,261
Oh. They're gonna love you.

636
00:55:28,296 --> 00:55:31,390
A Catholic who works with coloreds
and lives with the Cubans.

637
00:55:31,951 --> 00:55:34,304
The bigger problem is
R.D.'s brother-in-law.

638
00:55:34,339 --> 00:55:36,746
Who'ss he?
Chief Figgis.

639
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,595
Joe Coughlin.

640
00:55:55,582 --> 00:55:57,709
I don't shake hands with Papists.

641
00:55:58,168 --> 00:55:59,806
No offense.

642
00:55:59,841 --> 00:56:01,223
None taken.

643
00:56:01,255 --> 00:56:04,536
It help if I tell you I haven't
been to church in half of my life?

644
00:56:07,135 --> 00:56:08,895
Alright, now.

645
00:56:09,261 --> 00:56:11,044
R.D.

646
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:14,396
Word is your causin'
trouble down in Ybor.

647
00:56:15,518 --> 00:56:16,998
How's that?

648
00:56:18,352 --> 00:56:21,766
Well, we hear you're stickin' up places.

649
00:56:22,856 --> 00:56:25,292
I don't know a damn thing about that.

650
00:56:27,524 --> 00:56:29,607
I'm just playing with you.

651
00:56:30,526 --> 00:56:31,987
You all know that.

652
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,322
R.D.

653
00:56:36,407 --> 00:56:39,756
This is a businessman
who's come here to business...

654
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:42,493
...and I suggest that
you do it with him.

655
00:56:43,164 --> 00:56:46,717
This man is a bootlegger...

656
00:56:46,752 --> 00:56:49,247
...and a fornicator with niggers.

657
00:56:50,502 --> 00:56:54,903
He needs to be tarred and feathered,
not done business with.

658
00:56:59,425 --> 00:57:02,867
I'm just playin'!
You can take a joke, right?

659
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:04,529
Sure, I can take a joke.

660
00:57:04,564 --> 00:57:06,693
Not if you become one, right?

661
00:57:11,018 --> 00:57:13,326
So you like the Parisian, right?

662
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,095
And if I did?

663
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,484
I might be able to cut you in
on 10% of the house take.

664
00:57:17,564 --> 00:57:19,585
You'd do that?
I would.

665
00:57:20,996 --> 00:57:25,347
Well, I ought to be worth more than 10%.

666
00:57:25,382 --> 00:57:26,572
What were you thinking?

667
00:57:26,607 --> 00:57:29,646
I was thinking 60.
60 percent?

668
00:57:29,681 --> 00:57:31,395
The biggest club in town?

669
00:57:32,075 --> 00:57:34,798
That's right.
For what exactly?

670
00:57:35,162 --> 00:57:37,886
My friends might look
on you more kindly.

671
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:40,377
What friends?
50%.

672
00:57:40,412 --> 00:57:43,251
Son, I ain't giving you 60%.
I ain't your son.

673
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:45,869
Ain't nobody's son.

674
00:57:45,904 --> 00:57:48,341
Save you father some embarrassment.

675
00:57:48,376 --> 00:57:50,275
What's that?
15%.

676
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:54,765
I will beat you to death.
Excuse me?

677
00:57:55,993 --> 00:57:57,193
You know...

678
00:57:59,097 --> 00:58:01,608
...that does sound like
a fair arrangment.

679
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:03,906
You go to 20?
I think 15's pretty good...

680
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:06,681
...for a job you won't
have to show up to work for.

681
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:12,446
Well, it's a fair deal...

682
00:58:12,481 --> 00:58:14,366
...and I'm pleased to agree to it.

683
00:58:16,323 --> 00:58:19,192
How to I pick up my cut?
Come by the Parisian...

684
00:58:19,227 --> 00:58:21,682
...second Tuesday, every month. 7 o'clock.

685
00:58:21,783 --> 00:58:23,665
Pleasure, Mr. Coughlin.

686
00:58:24,232 --> 00:58:25,722
Irv.

687
00:58:32,752 --> 00:58:34,505
Sounds like we have a deal.

688
00:58:37,588 --> 00:58:39,700
The boy's as dumb as a grape.

689
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:45,467
I don't understand what Maso wants.

690
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:49,354
Arrests are down 70%,
revenues up 300%.

691
00:58:49,389 --> 00:58:52,828
I don't like it...some kid sent
down here like we need supervision.

692
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,626
No, no. We don't need supervision.

693
00:58:54,661 --> 00:58:57,809
Digger want to look at the
Casino option, check progress...

694
00:58:57,844 --> 00:58:59,362
...that's all. He's gonna
report back to the old man.

695
00:58:59,397 --> 00:59:01,149
Hey, Joe, don't make a big thing of it.

696
00:59:01,184 --> 00:59:04,689
Maso still gonna listen to what his son
tells him about startin' a new casino.

697
00:59:04,724 --> 00:59:06,009
Don't worry about it.

698
00:59:06,536 --> 00:59:09,000
How'd he get the name Digger?
Because he's a fuckin' dummy.

699
00:59:09,035 --> 00:59:11,942
All they let him do is dig ditches
for the bodies they bump off.

700
00:59:12,075 --> 00:59:13,724
No shit! Yeah!

701
00:59:16,743 --> 00:59:18,349
That's great.

702
00:59:18,384 --> 00:59:23,166
<i>I had come up with a plan to invest in a
casino with stakeholders in Sarasota...</i>

703
00:59:23,201 --> 00:59:25,435
<i>...at the new Ritz development site.</i>

704
00:59:26,126 --> 00:59:27,951
Ritz Hotel and Casino.

705
00:59:27,986 --> 00:59:30,422
Top shelf.
Right to the casino.

706
00:59:30,457 --> 00:59:32,398
Absolute top level resort.

707
00:59:32,433 --> 00:59:36,390
Sure to be a good experience
whether you gamble or not.

708
00:59:40,638 --> 00:59:44,531
<i>For such a violent business it was
populated with surprising number of guys...</i>

709
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:46,614
<i>...who were just puttin'
food on the table.</i>

710
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:49,326
<i>Digger wasn't one of those guys.</i>

711
00:59:52,479 --> 00:59:54,052
So this is it.

712
00:59:54,065 --> 00:59:56,509
Volstead Act won't last forever, right?

713
00:59:56,544 --> 00:59:58,416
What we gonna do when Prohibition ends?

714
00:59:58,568 --> 00:59:59,777
Gambling.

715
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:02,820
We use the connections we put
together to get it legalized...

716
01:00:02,855 --> 01:00:04,944
...and we're the only ones
in place to run it.

717
01:00:04,979 --> 01:00:06,435
And this is it?

718
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,269
Will be. Ritz Longboat Key.

719
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:10,503
I sat down with the
owners of Sarasota last week.

720
01:00:10,703 --> 01:00:13,231
Why'd they let us in?
Because the can't get gambling legal...

721
01:00:13,331 --> 01:00:14,749
...and they can't run a casino.

722
01:00:14,784 --> 01:00:17,712
The own the property, we run the casino.
We chop the profits 50/50.

723
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:19,328
Wait a minute.

724
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:22,550
Do we have a magic
stick for changin' laws?

725
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,542
I heard you got bingo legal.

726
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:27,930
It's a step. It's like a prerequisite,
you gotta do one thing and then...

727
01:00:27,965 --> 01:00:29,604
Yeah, I know...a prerequisite.

728
01:00:29,637 --> 01:00:32,508
Your grandmother can
come down, so plan the church.

729
01:00:32,884 --> 01:00:34,293
Bingo.

730
01:00:34,789 --> 01:00:39,044
Look, I got bag men to buy inspectors
in Talahassee and Sarasota.

731
01:00:39,124 --> 01:00:42,419
I got guys going after Senators
and IRS agents who gamble.

732
01:00:42,503 --> 01:00:46,253
We can gamble legal. We are rich. Legit.

733
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,898
For the long fuckin' haul!

734
01:00:49,469 --> 01:00:51,177
I talk a good game too...

735
01:00:52,303 --> 01:00:53,304
...but I like you.

736
01:00:56,474 --> 01:00:58,334
He's very smart boy.

737
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:03,504
Maso went crazy for the casino.

738
01:01:03,564 --> 01:01:06,734
He called every day for updates,
like it was his idea.

739
01:01:37,023 --> 01:01:41,453
It was addressed to
"Sir Joseph Coughlin, Niggerfucker."

740
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:44,286
Inside was a two word note.

741
01:01:44,321 --> 01:01:45,811
"Sixty percent."

742
01:02:03,612 --> 01:02:06,346
Same note. Same message.

743
01:02:17,287 --> 01:02:19,974
We are doing everything we can,
but he's protected.

744
01:02:20,413 --> 01:02:22,256
His roots here are too deep.

745
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:24,501
Well, time to start diggin'.

746
01:02:36,302 --> 01:02:37,767
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

747
01:02:37,847 --> 01:02:41,302
Virgil Beauregard.
What can I do for you today?

748
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:46,913
We're hopin' you can
talk some sense into RD Pruitt.

749
01:02:47,227 --> 01:02:50,317
Ain't too many people ever
had much success doing that.

750
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:52,821
We'd like you to try.

751
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:56,244
And what would the reason be?
His self-preservation.

752
01:02:56,278 --> 01:02:58,432
He needs to stop
shootin' up my clubs.

753
01:02:59,196 --> 01:03:00,643
Clubs?

754
01:03:01,282 --> 01:03:02,866
What kind of clubs?

755
01:03:02,901 --> 01:03:04,058
Great clubs?

756
01:03:04,158 --> 01:03:07,243
Because I belong to the Greater
Tampa Rotary Club myself...

757
01:03:07,327 --> 01:03:09,561
...and I don't recall ever seein' you.

758
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:14,835
I come here to do piece of business with
you and you wanna play fuckin' games?

759
01:03:15,085 --> 01:03:16,524
Is that what I wanna do?

760
01:03:16,836 --> 01:03:20,878
Look, you're the Grand Wizard
of the Ku Klux Klan around here...

761
01:03:20,913 --> 01:03:22,341
...congratulations...

762
01:03:22,463 --> 01:03:24,249
...but do you think that
we got where we are...

763
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:27,049
...by lettin' some inbred shitpickers
muscle us?

764
01:03:28,428 --> 01:03:32,877
If that's who you think we are,
you're makin' a fatal miscalculation, son.

765
01:03:34,016 --> 01:03:36,878
We're clerks, and bankers...

766
01:03:37,475 --> 01:03:40,135
police officers and deputies...

767
01:03:40,437 --> 01:03:42,224
...hell, we even got a judge.

768
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,273
And if you're dumb
enough to fight us...

769
01:03:46,473 --> 01:03:51,729
...we're gonna rain bloody hellfire
down on you and all you love.

770
01:03:53,364 --> 01:03:56,526
So you're threatening me with
people who are more powerful than you?

771
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:58,868
Exactly.

772
01:03:58,952 --> 01:04:01,494
What the fuck am I talkin' to you for?

773
01:04:32,979 --> 01:04:34,372
You've come to my home.

774
01:04:34,557 --> 01:04:36,899
Thought I'd save you the
trouble of haulin' me in.

775
01:04:36,983 --> 01:04:40,104
75 witnesses.
Not a one who'll come forward.

776
01:04:41,154 --> 01:04:42,363
You want a beer?

777
01:04:43,364 --> 01:04:47,094
It's near-beer. But it ain't bad
Love one.

778
01:04:58,208 --> 01:04:59,417
Thanks.

779
01:05:11,762 --> 01:05:13,677
I need R.D., Chief.

780
01:05:13,804 --> 01:05:16,129
I expect you feel that way.

781
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:20,165
You know what happens
if you don't help me.

782
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:23,283
No, I don't.

783
01:05:24,104 --> 01:05:26,144
More bodies are gonna pile up.

784
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:29,633
More articles like "Cigar City Slaughter"
are gonna get written...

785
01:05:30,778 --> 01:05:33,056
...and the Chief's gonna get pushed out.

786
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:37,239
You too.
Maybe.

787
01:05:37,323 --> 01:05:39,387
Difference is...
when you get pushed out...

788
01:05:40,038 --> 01:05:45,049
...someone does it with a
bullet to the back of your ear.

789
01:05:47,415 --> 01:05:50,617
I'm not sellin' out my wife's brother.

790
01:05:55,129 --> 01:05:57,747
I don't wanna to do this.
Do What?

791
01:05:57,799 --> 01:06:01,637
I don't wanna do what you're makin' me do.
I'm not makin' you do anything.

792
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:03,844
Yeah, you are.

793
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:11,924
What?
She didn't make it to Hollywood.

794
01:06:12,891 --> 01:06:15,264
She just made it to Los Angeles.

795
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,038
That's not right.

796
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:42,777
We got her with a special doctor now.
She's alright.

797
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:47,085
What kind of doctor?

798
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:50,193
The kind that
gets people off heroin, Irv.

799
01:06:52,423 --> 01:06:55,799
You do not ever call me
by my Christian name.

800
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:58,848
You will call me Chief Figgis...

801
01:06:58,928 --> 01:07:02,869
...for whatever years or days
remain in our acquaintance.

802
01:07:02,904 --> 01:07:05,451
Are we clear?
I didn't do this to her.

803
01:07:05,486 --> 01:07:09,570
You just name your price for telling me
where my daughter is.

804
01:07:09,605 --> 01:07:14,205
She's in a clean, safe facility and I'm not
gonna tell you where she is, until we...

805
01:07:16,362 --> 01:07:17,869
Until?

806
01:07:59,477 --> 01:08:02,917
R.D., you are going to
meet with this boy again...

807
01:08:03,772 --> 01:08:07,312
...and that's the end of the
discussion on the matter.

808
01:08:17,367 --> 01:08:20,212
Yes, it'll just be the two of us.

809
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:23,456
Longboat Key...

810
01:08:23,956 --> 01:08:26,250
...by the Ritz. Tonight at ten.

811
01:08:35,341 --> 01:08:37,595
When do I get her location?

812
01:08:37,635 --> 01:08:39,969
As soon as I get out
of this meeting alive.

813
01:08:41,426 --> 01:08:42,887
You do it yourself.

814
01:08:44,264 --> 01:08:45,349
What's that?

815
01:08:45,473 --> 01:08:49,702
If you're going to kill him,
be man enough to pull the trigger.

816
01:08:50,269 --> 01:08:54,994
Ain't no pride in having other people
do what you're too weak to do yourself.

817
01:08:57,775 --> 01:09:01,300
In my experience doesn't
take much to pull the trigger.

818
01:09:33,388 --> 01:09:34,938
Where is my brother-in-law?

819
01:09:35,553 --> 01:09:36,958
He didn't come.

820
01:09:37,431 --> 01:09:40,849
Boys, this one here is rat-tricky.

821
01:09:43,143 --> 01:09:47,939
Take your eyes off that pea shooter,
I promise it will be in his hands.

822
01:09:48,023 --> 01:09:49,192
Not likely.

823
01:09:55,113 --> 01:09:56,984
You a man of your word?

824
01:09:57,323 --> 01:09:58,824
Depends on who I give it to.

825
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:02,426
So you ain't come alone like I ordered?

826
01:10:02,783 --> 01:10:05,345
Shit, R.D., that would spoil the fun.

827
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,946
Where they at?

828
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,969
You know, this could be the
biggest casino in the United States...

829
01:10:13,004 --> 01:10:15,257
...when they end Prohibition.
They ain't gonna end Prohibition...

830
01:10:15,357 --> 01:10:16,857
... in a God fearing country.

831
01:10:16,892 --> 01:10:18,400
Country's in the tank.

832
01:10:18,435 --> 01:10:20,341
Banks going under,
the cities are bankrupt.

833
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:22,551
Cause we got a communist president.

834
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,598
Because we're not taxing liquor.

835
01:10:24,633 --> 01:10:28,336
And that's why this state's gonna
change it's laws to legalize gambling.

836
01:10:28,348 --> 01:10:31,719
And you could be part of that.
I don't wanna be a part of nothin' with you.

837
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:40,109
How much is he paying you?

838
01:10:40,898 --> 01:10:43,410
Who?
Albert White.

839
01:10:43,444 --> 01:10:45,778
How much is he payin' you
to shoot up my speaks?

840
01:10:45,862 --> 01:10:48,040
You're doin' a hell of a job for him.

841
01:10:50,573 --> 01:10:52,973
Yeah, I took his Catholic money.

842
01:10:53,952 --> 01:10:55,661
You know why?

843
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:57,979
Cause I'd have done it for free.

844
01:10:59,581 --> 01:11:01,325
You are a pestilence.

845
01:11:01,666 --> 01:11:06,054
You and your nigger whore girlfriend
and your dirty dago friends.

846
01:11:07,379 --> 01:11:09,277
I'm a take the Parisian.

847
01:11:10,589 --> 01:11:13,957
Not 60%, the whole thing.

848
01:11:14,717 --> 01:11:17,155
I'm a take all your clubs.

849
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,439
I'm a take everything you got.

850
01:11:20,265 --> 01:11:22,927
Might even go by your house...

851
01:11:23,724 --> 01:11:27,435
...tear off a piece of that nigger
girl before I cut her throat.

852
01:11:29,481 --> 01:11:33,457
You ain't got this yet
but you leavin' town, boy.

853
01:11:34,108 --> 01:11:36,629
You just forgot your pack your bags.

854
01:11:38,652 --> 01:11:40,162
Alright.

855
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:42,071
Go ahead.

856
01:11:56,958 --> 01:11:58,787
Bring the car around.

857
01:11:59,168 --> 01:12:01,691
Alright, we'll get you to a doctor.

858
01:12:01,726 --> 01:12:02,906
It hurts.

859
01:12:02,923 --> 01:12:04,898
Hurts but it's not gonna kill you.

860
01:12:08,968 --> 01:12:11,405
Ah, fuck! We should've never
showed him the pictures.

861
01:12:12,055 --> 01:12:14,290
What pictures?
Figgis.

862
01:12:14,557 --> 01:12:17,117
What we had to do to put
this fuckin' guy down.

863
01:12:17,152 --> 01:12:19,030
Price was too high.

864
01:12:21,062 --> 01:12:23,147
I think it was you who shot me.
What?

865
01:12:23,231 --> 01:12:25,942
I got him before he got a shot off.
It wasn't me who shot you.

866
01:12:26,026 --> 01:12:27,651
It couldn't have been nobody else.
Fasini was back there.

867
01:12:27,735 --> 01:12:31,003
It was Fasini who fuckin' shot you.
No, Fasini was coming from back there.

868
01:12:31,103 --> 01:12:34,733
Yeah, Fasini came over here. He came on
this angle, like this, right here.

869
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:36,673
Yeah, I was over here.
I got these motherfuckers.

870
01:12:36,682 --> 01:12:37,863
You hit me!

871
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:41,048
Ah, just get the fucking car.

872
01:12:41,618 --> 01:12:43,463
It's gonna be a great casino.

873
01:12:44,749 --> 01:12:46,943
Right? Yeah!

874
01:12:49,124 --> 01:12:52,398
Albert had been paying R.D.
on his own to come after us.

875
01:12:52,627 --> 01:12:55,318
But once we killed
members of the Klan...

876
01:12:55,549 --> 01:12:57,488
the Klan took it personal.

877
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:03,018
They came to finish me off at the hospital,
but we had guards posted at the doors.

878
01:13:09,308 --> 01:13:13,819
When the Klansmen gave up and went home,
Dion had them followed.

879
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:26,935
The subsequent string of beatings,
bombings and murders...

880
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:30,759
...effectively put an end to the
power of the KKK in Tampa.

881
01:13:45,253 --> 01:13:47,586
How do you feel?
Alright.

882
01:13:47,621 --> 01:13:49,033
You?

883
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,968
Good.

884
01:14:28,203 --> 01:14:31,394
Irv's wife moved out and
took their son with her.

885
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:34,934
No one saw Loretta for the whole season.

886
01:15:38,344 --> 01:15:39,868
Can I take your name?

887
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:42,129
You wanna get married?

888
01:15:44,392 --> 01:15:46,575
We are married, aren't we?

889
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,771
Graciela Isabella...

890
01:15:53,648 --> 01:15:56,112
I can't remember them all.
Lunes, Martes...

891
01:15:57,066 --> 01:15:59,291
I don't have that many names.
Wait, wait, wait,wait

892
01:16:01,778 --> 01:16:03,840
Graciela Coughlin.

893
01:16:04,657 --> 01:16:06,659
Best thing ever happened to that name.
Of yours? Yes.

894
01:16:16,918 --> 01:16:18,579
I bought buildings.

895
01:16:19,376 --> 01:16:22,825
Wow, we're married and just like that,
now you bought some buildings?

896
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:25,797
Yes, I bought three buildings
by the Perez factory.

897
01:16:25,882 --> 01:16:27,719
What are you going to
do with these buildings?

898
01:16:27,799 --> 01:16:31,053
I want to give shelter to
abandoned women and children.

899
01:16:31,302 --> 01:16:33,116
It's important, Joe.

900
01:16:33,724 --> 01:16:36,462
What happened to
Cuban politics for a cause?

901
01:16:36,974 --> 01:16:38,921
I fell in love with you.

902
01:16:38,976 --> 01:16:41,196
You restrict my mobility.

903
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:43,356
Come here.

904
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,105
I love you.

905
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:50,169
After months of seclusion...

906
01:16:50,254 --> 01:16:53,722
Loretta emerged from home and declared
that she would only wear white...

907
01:16:54,174 --> 01:16:56,801
...a decision made for
her by Jesus Christ...

908
01:16:56,886 --> 01:16:58,768
...to whom she would now be wed.

909
01:17:04,812 --> 01:17:07,636
Her show was a hit...

910
01:17:08,484 --> 01:17:10,343
...and her vision of Tampa,
cleansed off sin,

911
01:17:10,443 --> 01:17:12,943
didn't include a casino.

912
01:17:14,452 --> 01:17:16,469
What's the problem with this preacher?

913
01:17:16,494 --> 01:17:20,161
There's no problem with the preacher.
Everything's gonna work out fine.

914
01:17:20,196 --> 01:17:22,754
Nothing can jeopardize our casino deal.

915
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:26,190
Absolutely, Maso. 100%.
Do what you need to.

916
01:17:27,552 --> 01:17:30,802
Look, I'm gonna go down there,
I'm gonna talk to her and...

917
01:17:32,098 --> 01:17:34,601
What needs to be done, will get done.
Okay?

918
01:17:34,977 --> 01:17:39,393
Just make sure the problem goes away.
I don't want to hear about it.

919
01:17:39,428 --> 01:17:41,342
Alright. Thanks a lot.

920
01:17:51,538 --> 01:17:53,388
You don't need to listen in on me.

921
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:56,675
Ask me anything you want
about my business, I'll tell you.

922
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,382
It's your business, not mine.

923
01:18:01,134 --> 01:18:04,152
But I will. Anything you wanna know.

924
01:18:07,598 --> 01:18:13,060
I came down here it was all about
gettin' revenge, makin' money...

925
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:16,811
...now everything I do, every step I take

926
01:18:16,911 --> 01:18:20,811
...is about you and me and
protecting our future...

927
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,943
...and that's what you
need to understand.

928
01:18:22,978 --> 01:18:28,163
But if those steps make you,
little by little, someone else...

929
01:18:28,198 --> 01:18:30,554
...then you will
not be you anymore.

930
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:35,441
You're you, except for
all those bad things you did.

931
01:18:37,172 --> 01:18:38,966
You're almost you.

932
01:18:40,384 --> 01:18:42,606
I want the real you.

933
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:48,936
You have me. Come here.

934
01:18:49,688 --> 01:18:52,108
You have me.

935
01:19:13,966 --> 01:19:16,552
Gambling destroys the spirit.

936
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:18,710
She's right.
Amen.

937
01:19:19,725 --> 01:19:24,620
One hears much of personal liberty...

938
01:19:26,734 --> 01:19:30,127
...but when you've seen
the barbarity of man...

939
01:19:30,154 --> 01:19:33,051
...and been treated to personal doses.

940
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,408
You see..It is simply
the liberty for gambler.

941
01:19:46,006 --> 01:19:49,907
For the gambler to fritter
away the gifts of God...

942
01:19:49,942 --> 01:19:53,173
...using it for himself.
Amen.

943
01:19:54,685 --> 01:19:59,794
Personal liberty is the liberty...

944
01:19:59,829 --> 01:20:02,103
...of a murderer...

945
01:20:04,073 --> 01:20:05,942
...a seducer...

946
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:13,716
...a wolf who wants to
remain in a sheep fold.

947
01:20:16,672 --> 01:20:18,965
I ask you...

948
01:20:19,756 --> 01:20:23,058
How cheap is your virtue?

949
01:20:23,093 --> 01:20:26,312
No! Not cheap.
Not cheap.

950
01:20:26,412 --> 01:20:29,549
How cheap is your virtue?
It's not cheap!

951
01:20:29,689 --> 01:20:33,104
My virtue's always been pretty cheap.
What virtue?

952
01:20:33,149 --> 01:20:39,506
And they seek to build a house
of gambling on our waterfront.

953
01:20:41,452 --> 01:20:43,697
When we act, we act!

954
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:49,838
God bless you.

955
01:20:50,463 --> 01:20:53,406
I'm afraid there's only
one way to deal with it.

956
01:20:53,441 --> 01:20:55,261
With her around the
casino gets voted down.

957
01:20:55,345 --> 01:20:58,752
The casino gets voted down,
me and you are on the hook for it.

958
01:20:58,755 --> 01:21:00,052
I'll handle it. Okay?

959
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:05,746
Mr. Coughlin!
Ms. Figgis, such a pleasure!

960
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:08,201
Thanks so much for seeing us.
It was a great show today.

961
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:09,401
Great! Terrific!

962
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:12,332
You know my father...
Ah, Chief.

963
01:21:12,699 --> 01:21:14,369
..and this is Mayweather.

964
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:17,625
Mayweather is taking the good
word and preaching it down south.

965
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,659
It's a pleasure, sir.
My pleasure. That's good.

966
01:21:19,694 --> 01:21:22,081
They need to hear about this in Miami.
Keep up the good work.

967
01:21:22,116 --> 01:21:23,475
I'll try, sir.

968
01:21:24,257 --> 01:21:25,317
What can I do for you?

969
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:28,517
I was hoping I could just have
a word with you for a second.

970
01:21:31,222 --> 01:21:36,543
I was hoping to talk to you
a little bit about the Ritz.

971
01:21:39,192 --> 01:21:42,182
My father says there once
was a good man in you.

972
01:21:43,361 --> 01:21:45,482
I wasn't aware he departed.

973
01:21:45,572 --> 01:21:47,981
You do quite a lot for the people here.

974
01:21:48,452 --> 01:21:52,620
But we both know, your good works
are mitigated by your evil deeds.

975
01:21:52,665 --> 01:21:53,981
We do?

976
01:21:54,335 --> 01:21:57,463
You profit from the illegal
addictions of others...

977
01:21:57,547 --> 01:22:01,040
...their weakness and sloth
and libidinous behavior...

978
01:22:02,093 --> 01:22:04,283
...but you can free yourself of that.

979
01:22:04,556 --> 01:22:06,250
And I don't want to.

980
01:22:06,558 --> 01:22:08,218
Of course you do.

981
01:22:09,855 --> 01:22:12,313
Miss Figgis, you're a lovely woman...

982
01:22:12,482 --> 01:22:14,502
...and your story is amazing.

983
01:22:14,537 --> 01:22:17,791
I'm not surprised the flock's
up threefold since you started here.

984
01:22:17,826 --> 01:22:19,497
More like 5 times.

985
01:22:20,408 --> 01:22:24,008
More booze has been drunk
in the last 10 years than ever before...

986
01:22:24,043 --> 01:22:26,240
...because people don't
wanna be told they can't do it.

987
01:22:26,624 --> 01:22:29,190
The same could be said of fornication.

988
01:22:29,672 --> 01:22:33,706
People want it, but don't
wanna be told they can't have it.

989
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:35,305
Why should they?

990
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:36,935
I'm sorry?

991
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:39,702
If people want to fornicate,
I see no reason to stop them.

992
01:22:39,724 --> 01:22:43,694
And if they wish to lie down with animals?
Do they?

993
01:22:44,274 --> 01:22:45,697
I'm sorry?

994
01:22:45,732 --> 01:22:48,643
Do people wish to lie down with animals?
Some do.

995
01:22:48,743 --> 01:22:51,299
And their sickness will spread
if you have your way.

996
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:54,144
Forgive me. I see no correlation between
alcohol and lyin' down with animals.

997
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:56,883
There's a correlation across all sin.

998
01:22:56,918 --> 01:23:02,212
It's all against the wishes of God,
therefore all equally offensive.

999
01:23:03,005 --> 01:23:06,617
Let me apologize. I think we
got off on the wrong foot here.

1000
01:23:06,826 --> 01:23:09,558
I'm just here to ask you if
you would be amenable...

1001
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:13,258
to omitting the Casino issue
from your sermons...

1002
01:23:13,266 --> 01:23:16,979
...and in exchange,
we're gonna bring a business here.

1003
01:23:17,063 --> 01:23:18,573
Business will create jobs...

1004
01:23:18,608 --> 01:23:21,104
...which will reduce the
sinfulness that comes with...

1005
01:23:21,105 --> 01:23:23,804
...poverty and idle hands.

1006
01:23:24,364 --> 01:23:26,399
We'd be willing to
contribute to the church.

1007
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:29,280
No, we'd be willing to
build a few churches.

1008
01:23:35,546 --> 01:23:39,474
If God rewrites the Bible to
cast gambling as virtuous...

1009
01:23:39,509 --> 01:23:42,236
...I will refrain from
speaking against it.

1010
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:48,746
But until then, we don't get to
pick our sins, Mr. Coughlin.

1011
01:23:53,985 --> 01:23:55,766
I can't do it.

1012
01:23:56,364 --> 01:24:00,272
What? It's gonna fuck up the whole deal.
What do you mean, you can't do it?

1013
01:24:00,372 --> 01:24:03,325
I know. No one touches her.

1014
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:06,846
That's a mistake.

1015
01:24:08,295 --> 01:24:10,067
No shit.

1016
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:27,324
Can we get you anything?
No, we're ok, thanks.

1017
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:31,863
We know you men are busy and
we don't want to waste your time.

1018
01:24:32,073 --> 01:24:35,438
We are not going to invest
in the casino at the Ritz.

1019
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:41,845
Are you... sure about that?
I'm afraid so.

1020
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,919
The publicity is too much.

1021
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,202
One woman preachin' in a fuckin' tent?

1022
01:24:46,237 --> 01:24:50,765
Yes, because the casino would
represent only 2% of our total holdings...

1023
01:24:50,849 --> 01:24:56,172
...and we can't appear to be a
company of Irish and Italian Catholics...

1024
01:24:56,207 --> 01:24:59,515
...turning white
Protestant girls into drug addicts.

1025
01:25:00,317 --> 01:25:03,356
People I work for are gonna
be very upset about this.

1026
01:25:03,448 --> 01:25:06,075
We aren't men to be muscled or conned.

1027
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:09,701
We are an institution.
We can't be bribed or bullied...

1028
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:14,220
...because I simply represent the
vested interest of a board of governors.

1029
01:25:14,255 --> 01:25:17,264
We are the landed, white
gentry in this country...

1030
01:25:17,299 --> 01:25:21,888
...and we have no plans to
carve off a strip of this country...

1031
01:25:21,972 --> 01:25:25,384
...which we have gone to
great pains to break and colonize...

1032
01:25:25,419 --> 01:25:30,160
...and hand it over to Catholics,
Jews, darkies or dagos.

1033
01:25:32,024 --> 01:25:35,056
It's just a bigger, better racket,
that's all...

1034
01:25:35,091 --> 01:25:38,433
...keepin' the money in your hands
and out of the hands of people like us.

1035
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:43,871
All those people...

1036
01:25:43,955 --> 01:25:49,848
...the Negro, on whose back you went
to great pains to break this country...

1037
01:25:49,883 --> 01:25:51,999
...and the immigrants who
came over here with nothin'...

1038
01:25:52,034 --> 01:25:53,927
...and worked their fingers
to the fuckin' bone...

1039
01:25:54,011 --> 01:25:58,620
...all believed it when you told
them they could get ahead...

1040
01:25:58,655 --> 01:26:02,146
...and one day, and I may not live
to see it, they're gonna figure it out.

1041
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:05,299
But I tell you what,
I'd hate to fuckin' be you.

1042
01:26:05,526 --> 01:26:10,191
Standin' between those people
and what they deserve.

1043
01:26:12,575 --> 01:26:15,185
Good luck to you, prick!

1044
01:26:18,498 --> 01:26:20,539
Would have been a hell of a casino.

1045
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:25,710
You'll get another chance.
Things swing back around.

1046
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:27,634
Not all things.

1047
01:26:28,635 --> 01:26:31,927
They announced it on the radio,
just when we got back.

1048
01:26:34,018 --> 01:26:37,612
President-Elect Roosevelt promised
to sign the Cullen-Harrison Act...

1049
01:26:37,647 --> 01:26:42,167
...the minute he was elected,
effectively ending Prohibition.

1050
01:27:20,035 --> 01:27:22,705
Hello, Ms. Figgis!
Mr. Coughlin.

1051
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:26,017
May I? Yeah.
Just for a minute? Please sit.

1052
01:27:27,961 --> 01:27:29,748
You're lookin' very well.

1053
01:27:30,088 --> 01:27:34,001
I see, you're not wearin' white.

1054
01:27:34,678 --> 01:27:36,701
It's almost white.

1055
01:27:37,598 --> 01:27:39,346
Would you like a menu?
Thank you very much.

1056
01:27:39,381 --> 01:27:40,896
Can I get a cup of coffee, please?

1057
01:27:44,065 --> 01:27:45,400
Thank you.

1058
01:27:52,116 --> 01:27:54,800
Why does my father hate you so much?

1059
01:27:57,291 --> 01:28:00,920
I'm a crook. He's the Chief of Police.

1060
01:28:00,955 --> 01:28:02,431
That's how it goes, I guess.

1061
01:28:02,589 --> 01:28:07,170
No, he liked you.
He said you were the mayor of Ybor.

1062
01:28:07,803 --> 01:28:09,377
Is that what he said?
Mm-hmm.

1063
01:28:13,811 --> 01:28:15,389
What did you do...

1064
01:28:18,064 --> 01:28:19,828
...to him?

1065
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:34,298
We had photographs.

1066
01:28:39,343 --> 01:28:41,090
And you showed them to him.

1067
01:28:41,385 --> 01:28:42,936
I showed him two.

1068
01:28:43,512 --> 01:28:45,655
How many did you have?

1069
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,938
All of them.

1070
01:28:53,525 --> 01:28:55,635
We're all going to hell.

1071
01:28:57,198 --> 01:28:59,116
I don't think you're going to hell.

1072
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,376
You know what I learned...

1073
01:29:01,996 --> 01:29:06,838
...as I've been thrusting
my soul out to God?

1074
01:29:06,873 --> 01:29:08,005
What?

1075
01:29:09,673 --> 01:29:14,382
This is heaven...right here.

1076
01:29:15,512 --> 01:29:17,186
We're in it now.

1077
01:29:17,431 --> 01:29:19,477
Then how come it looks like hell?

1078
01:29:19,641 --> 01:29:21,942
Because we fucked it all up.

1079
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:32,969
After my trials...

1080
01:29:36,747 --> 01:29:39,042
...I slept in the bed of my childhood.

1081
01:29:43,215 --> 01:29:45,466
I felt certain again.

1082
01:29:47,136 --> 01:29:48,385
I missed that.

1083
01:29:54,313 --> 01:29:56,396
I don't know if there is a God...

1084
01:30:00,609 --> 01:30:02,531
...but I hope there is...

1085
01:30:05,615 --> 01:30:07,702
...and I hope he's kind.

1086
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,710
Wouldn't that be swell?

1087
01:30:16,757 --> 01:30:18,343
Yes, it would be.

1088
01:30:25,308 --> 01:30:28,020
You seem not to despair.
Do you have a secret?

1089
01:30:28,104 --> 01:30:30,234
No, no secrets.

1090
01:30:31,608 --> 01:30:35,998
I have my wife. That's enough.

1091
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:39,082
But what if you lose her?

1092
01:30:44,248 --> 01:30:45,817
What are you going to do now?

1093
01:30:46,418 --> 01:30:51,144
What do you mean?
You stopped me, stopped the casino...

1094
01:30:51,425 --> 01:30:52,802
...law couldn't do it...

1095
01:30:52,886 --> 01:30:57,472
...the people couldn't do it.
The Klan couldn't do it. You did it.

1096
01:30:57,556 --> 01:31:01,353
I didn't get rid of alchohol.
No, that was too big.

1097
01:31:01,388 --> 01:31:04,858
But you stopped gambling and before
you came along it was a lock.

1098
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:08,284
I did do that, didn't I?
Yes, you did.

1099
01:31:11,242 --> 01:31:13,200
What's your father gonna do?

1100
01:31:14,746 --> 01:31:16,748
Sit in his chair, I guess...

1101
01:31:17,497 --> 01:31:19,188
...blind with rage that...

1102
01:31:19,288 --> 01:31:23,688
...men touched his daughter
the way he used to touch his wife...

1103
01:31:23,825 --> 01:31:25,300
...and worse.

1104
01:31:31,435 --> 01:31:35,959
He goes around the house
whispering one word over and over.

1105
01:31:36,441 --> 01:31:37,775
What word?

1106
01:31:38,776 --> 01:31:40,579
Repent.

1107
01:31:44,075 --> 01:31:46,824
Repent, repent.

1108
01:31:49,790 --> 01:31:52,677
Give him some time.
Maybe he'll come out of it.

1109
01:32:27,630 --> 01:32:30,381
We heard from Boston.
All three trucks made it up there fine.

1110
01:32:30,465 --> 01:32:32,924
Same payoffs as last week.
So, there's no problem.

1111
01:32:32,959 --> 01:32:34,057
Very good.

1112
01:32:34,178 --> 01:32:36,966
And Loretta Figgis cut
her own throat yesterday.

1113
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:39,933
What?

1114
01:32:40,185 --> 01:32:42,980
Yeah, she did it at home
in the Chief's bed, they say.

1115
01:32:44,106 --> 01:32:45,669
You gotta give it to her...

1116
01:32:46,946 --> 01:32:49,466
...she's got moxie!
I couldn't do that.

1117
01:32:50,322 --> 01:32:53,011
You know, I guess
some things are meant to be.

1118
01:32:53,046 --> 01:32:56,530
She could have done it 3 months earlier
and done us all a fuckin' favor.

1119
01:32:57,583 --> 01:32:59,752
Well, too late.

1120
01:33:11,956 --> 01:33:15,492
<i>Death of a Madonna</i>
You blame yourself?

1121
01:33:16,354 --> 01:33:19,486
She went out West as
so many other girls do...

1122
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:21,024
...and she was preyed upon.

1123
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,871
Not by you.

1124
01:33:22,906 --> 01:33:24,324
Well, by men like me...

1125
01:33:24,409 --> 01:33:29,163
...to get the booze,
to get the girls, get the drugs...

1126
01:33:29,247 --> 01:33:31,377
...one hand washes the other.

1127
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:37,341
You don't need it, mi amigo,
We are not our brother's keeper.

1128
01:33:37,425 --> 01:33:40,637
In fact it is an insult to
our brother to believe we are.

1129
01:33:40,721 --> 01:33:42,387
Look at these people.

1130
01:33:43,472 --> 01:33:47,105
If this man dies of, say drunkenness...

1131
01:33:47,185 --> 01:33:48,990
...is it our fault?

1132
01:33:52,484 --> 01:33:54,639
When did you take this picture?

1133
01:33:55,656 --> 01:33:57,331
A month ago.

1134
01:33:58,159 --> 01:33:59,722
Are you sure?

1135
01:34:01,747 --> 01:34:06,853
I took this picture myself.
A month and three days ago. Why?

1136
01:34:08,132 --> 01:34:11,069
Because that woman died in 1927.

1137
01:34:53,385 --> 01:34:56,405
There's never been
anyone like you in my life.

1138
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:01,194
One day I'm going to
be good enough for you.

1139
01:35:03,697 --> 01:35:06,296
You sure it's her?
You tell me.

1140
01:35:07,246 --> 01:35:09,932
You told Graciela?
Of course I told her.

1141
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:13,086
Jesus Christ.

1142
01:35:13,585 --> 01:35:15,308
What you wouldn't tell your woman?

1143
01:35:15,424 --> 01:35:18,968
No, I don't tell them shit
but you're more of a nance than me.

1144
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:21,080
What'd you say?
Look, sorry, hon...

1145
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:22,980
...that girl I was bent out of shape
over for years...

1146
01:35:22,990 --> 01:35:25,180
...she's not dead. She's in Miami.

1147
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:27,563
Don't make a big
fuckin' thing out of it.

1148
01:35:35,072 --> 01:35:36,198
When you go home?

1149
01:35:36,699 --> 01:35:38,039
Going where?
What do you mean where?

1150
01:35:38,050 --> 01:35:40,939
You found out this girl you used
to be bugs for is 200 miles away.

1151
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:42,893
When you goin'?

1152
01:35:47,504 --> 01:35:52,352
I'm goin' to go after this thing with Maso.
Good. Give you something to live for.

1153
01:35:53,051 --> 01:35:54,144
What does that mean?

1154
01:35:54,179 --> 01:35:57,557
Him and his guys are takin' over
half the train to get down here.

1155
01:35:59,267 --> 01:36:01,138
That's a big fucking entourage!

1156
01:36:02,106 --> 01:36:04,525
Ah, bullshit,
I ain't worried about it.

1157
01:36:04,609 --> 01:36:06,511
There's no percentage in killin' us.

1158
01:36:07,277 --> 01:36:11,871
We do $ 11.5 million a year from
rum alone in this fuckin' cop town.

1159
01:36:12,296 --> 01:36:13,459
What's he gonna kill us for?

1160
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:16,959
All we do is send him bags of money
up to his mansion in fuckin' Mahatts.

1161
01:36:17,059 --> 01:36:19,004
I don't like the signs.
What fuckin' signs?

1162
01:36:19,084 --> 01:36:21,539
We lost the casino,
we never moved our narcotics...

1163
01:36:21,574 --> 01:36:24,453
...and you're a Irish in a world where there
ain't much of a shortage in guineas.

1164
01:36:24,488 --> 01:36:27,638
Ok, you're walkin' into a building
where he bought up every room.

1165
01:36:28,263 --> 01:36:31,579
I can't hide a weapon. Nothin'.
You're going in blind and we'll be outside.

1166
01:36:34,563 --> 01:36:36,398
Is that enough signs for you?

1167
01:36:41,696 --> 01:36:43,761
I need you to do something for me.

1168
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:47,052
I need you to go stay in
Miami for just a little while.

1169
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:52,312
How long is "a little while"?

1170
01:36:52,393 --> 01:36:54,619
I don't know. Not too long.

1171
01:36:55,317 --> 01:36:58,069
I'm not gonna have your address.
I want you give it to Dion.

1172
01:36:58,153 --> 01:37:02,240
When the time comes, he'll tell me
where you are and I'll come get you.

1173
01:37:04,578 --> 01:37:08,371
So you can find out if you are
as cruel as you need to be?

1174
01:37:09,461 --> 01:37:11,211
I guess so.

1175
01:37:12,550 --> 01:37:14,384
Joseph.

1176
01:37:15,133 --> 01:37:20,309
Even if you win today's battle, there
is so much violence in what you do.

1177
01:37:28,196 --> 01:37:29,971
I know.

1178
01:38:33,985 --> 01:38:38,310
Gino, where you livin' now?
In Quonsett. Settlin' down?

1179
01:38:38,899 --> 01:38:42,685
Two kids, hanquera, casa, whole thing.

1180
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,430
Got any?
Not for me.

1181
01:38:45,431 --> 01:38:47,474
There is never a right time.

1182
01:39:11,177 --> 01:39:12,802
This way.

1183
01:39:29,078 --> 01:39:31,317
How are you, my son?

1184
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:33,337
Fine.

1185
01:39:33,376 --> 01:39:37,661
Fausto, see if Dion needs anything.
Please, come in.

1186
01:39:50,277 --> 01:39:54,033
So, how've you been?
Good. You?

1187
01:39:54,133 --> 01:39:57,430
More good days than bad.
Right.

1188
01:40:01,709 --> 01:40:04,943
This is the filly who fucked
up the whole casino thing?

1189
01:40:05,879 --> 01:40:07,926
Yeah, that's her.

1190
01:40:08,301 --> 01:40:10,530
Why didn't you clip her then?

1191
01:40:11,014 --> 01:40:14,107
Too much blowback.
That's not it.

1192
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:17,501
You're not a killer, Joseph.

1193
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:19,822
You are a bandit in a suit.

1194
01:40:19,857 --> 01:40:23,298
That's why you didn't kill that
"puttana pazza."

1195
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:25,922
You know how much money this
place was doing when I got here?

1196
01:40:25,957 --> 01:40:28,161
You know what it's doing it now?
But that's all rum.

1197
01:40:28,261 --> 01:40:30,166
You neglected the girls
and the narcotics.

1198
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:32,535
I went after the rum because
it was the most profitable...

1199
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:34,535
...and I added four houses in my time here

1200
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,225
Yeah, but you could've added more.

1201
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:39,244
Maso, Look...
Mr. Pescatore!

1202
01:40:41,683 --> 01:40:44,479
I ran Ybor. I ran Tampa.

1203
01:40:44,563 --> 01:40:47,152
Do you ever have a problem?
You did more than that.

1204
01:40:47,252 --> 01:40:49,473
You ran the whole coast.

1205
01:40:49,508 --> 01:40:53,707
You boxed out Albert, put him
in a little piss corner of Miami.

1206
01:40:53,784 --> 01:40:55,826
I've been through the books.

1207
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,747
You made as a force down here.

1208
01:40:58,782 --> 01:41:01,459
And now, what? No Irish need apply?
What can I be?

1209
01:41:01,494 --> 01:41:03,403
What I fuckin' tell you to be...

1210
01:41:03,438 --> 01:41:05,644
...before you get
a fuckin' pop in the mouth!

1211
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:07,150
Mick!

1212
01:41:08,513 --> 01:41:11,527
You can be conciliere.

1213
01:41:11,898 --> 01:41:15,589
You teach Digger the ropes,
meet people...

1214
01:41:15,624 --> 01:41:17,302
...teach him to fish...

1215
01:41:17,819 --> 01:41:20,522
...but you need to take a haircut.

1216
01:41:20,557 --> 01:41:22,117
What kind of a haircut?

1217
01:41:22,197 --> 01:41:24,526
Digger gets your take.

1218
01:41:27,997 --> 01:41:31,089
Look, Mr. Pescatore.

1219
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:33,634
I think it's a fabulous idea.

1220
01:41:33,669 --> 01:41:36,388
Digger comes down here, takes over.

1221
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:38,973
We'll run Florida. We'll take over Cuba.

1222
01:41:39,058 --> 01:41:42,075
But my take's gotta stay
somewhere near where it is.

1223
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:45,150
And there's no power in being crew boss
and shakin' down longshoremen.

1224
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:48,727
You ever think, maybe,
that's the point, smart guy?

1225
01:41:48,762 --> 01:41:51,329
You need me. I built this.

1226
01:41:51,364 --> 01:41:52,612
We could use you.

1227
01:41:52,647 --> 01:41:55,857
But I'm sensing a lack of gratitude.
So am I.

1228
01:41:57,916 --> 01:42:02,846
You work for me, not the spics
or the niggers you hang out with.

1229
01:42:03,047 --> 01:42:07,561
If I tell you to clean the shit out
of my toilet, guess what you do?

1230
01:42:09,601 --> 01:42:15,238
I can kill your cunt girlfriend and burn
your house to ambers, if I feel like it.

1231
01:42:16,738 --> 01:42:23,228
So, do want to be crew boss or
clean the shit out of my toilet?

1232
01:42:23,328 --> 01:42:26,107
I'm accepting applications for both.

1233
01:42:33,051 --> 01:42:35,263
I guess it's crew boss.

1234
01:42:36,304 --> 01:42:37,842
That's my boy!

1235
01:42:42,104 --> 01:42:45,397
You want dinner tonight,
we have a few nice spots set aside.

1236
01:42:45,432 --> 01:42:49,361
You know, Joseph, what
I like about Albert White?

1237
01:42:49,575 --> 01:42:51,359
What?

1238
01:42:51,702 --> 01:42:56,684
Is that he knows Tampa too.
Which means nobody needs you, dumb fuck.

1239
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:14,443
My fortune's have changed a little bit.

1240
01:43:16,406 --> 01:43:19,368
Me and Maso, we patched things over.

1241
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:24,789
Turns out when you blew the casino deal,
He looked to me to help his son...

1242
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:27,432
...and that was just the start.

1243
01:43:29,063 --> 01:43:30,637
You see...

1244
01:43:34,237 --> 01:43:36,837
...you need to trust
the people you work with.

1245
01:43:40,565 --> 01:43:43,794
We don't get into this
game to play second...

1246
01:43:44,194 --> 01:43:46,346
...to back the wrong horse.

1247
01:43:48,737 --> 01:43:50,331
That's it.

1248
01:43:51,516 --> 01:43:55,137
You thought you'd be eatin' tomorrow,
lookin' at the fuckin' sun...

1249
01:43:58,382 --> 01:44:00,509
...well, think again.

1250
01:44:00,593 --> 01:44:04,920
Take your last look because you die now.
Wait.

1251
01:44:04,955 --> 01:44:07,468
Albert, I have something
you want to see.

1252
01:44:07,728 --> 01:44:10,834
Something that if you don't see,
you'll regret your whole life.

1253
01:44:11,361 --> 01:44:13,572
You'd never forgive yourself.

1254
01:44:21,083 --> 01:44:24,177
She's dead.
She look dead to you?

1255
01:44:25,669 --> 01:44:29,384
Where is she?
She's in the fucking picture, Albert.

1256
01:44:33,348 --> 01:44:34,683
Where is she?

1257
01:44:34,767 --> 01:44:38,260
I'd love to tell you.
I'd love to walk out of here more.

1258
01:44:39,172 --> 01:44:41,848
That's an old one.
You just folded up an old one.

1259
01:44:41,883 --> 01:44:43,205
That's what I thought too.

1260
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,561
Look at the guy in the
corner with the newspaper.

1261
01:44:45,596 --> 01:44:47,314
That was last month.

1262
01:44:47,829 --> 01:44:51,700
So you tell me or
I'll put you in the fuckin' ground.

1263
01:44:51,735 --> 01:44:56,037
I loved her too, Albert.
Like you love that woman? Yeah.

1264
01:44:56,085 --> 01:45:00,085
Is she a nigger or a spic? She's both.

1265
01:45:23,698 --> 01:45:25,198
Where the fuck are they?

1266
01:45:25,203 --> 01:45:28,403
Why don't you ask Albert,
he knows Tampa.

1267
01:45:28,419 --> 01:45:30,419
Do you know why all
the molasses and rum...

1268
01:45:30,619 --> 01:45:33,219
...that comes into Florida
comes through Tampa, Maso?

1269
01:45:34,521 --> 01:45:36,688
The tunnels. What tunnels?

1270
01:45:36,701 --> 01:45:39,901
The ones runnin' under
this neighborhood.

1271
01:45:40,086 --> 01:45:41,786
That's how they get the booze in.

1272
01:45:41,882 --> 01:45:44,582
That's where my men are right now.

1273
01:45:45,201 --> 01:45:48,201
Your guys are all standin' around
guardin' the front door...

1274
01:45:48,231 --> 01:45:50,731
...but that ain't where we're comin'.

1275
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:53,290
We're comin' for you, Maso...

1276
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:57,600
...but we're comin' from below.

1277
01:48:12,879 --> 01:48:14,179
You cleared the room?

1278
01:48:14,262 --> 01:48:16,107
Everything, the whole floor.

1279
01:48:16,307 --> 01:48:18,152
Seppe, give it another look.

1280
01:48:18,183 --> 01:48:22,483
Boss, they spotted Coughlin downstairs.
He even get a scratch?

1281
01:48:22,511 --> 01:48:23,911
A cut on the head.

1282
01:48:23,988 --> 01:48:27,488
I don't suppose you can wait
for him to die of blood poison.

1283
01:48:27,497 --> 01:48:30,297
Maro,
I don't think we got that kind of time.

1284
01:48:32,022 --> 01:48:37,522
It's a hard thing for a man
to have a son this stupid.

1285
01:48:42,908 --> 01:48:44,908
All clear, Boss.

1286
01:48:45,334 --> 01:48:48,901
I want you to cover
the door and the stairs...

1287
01:48:49,004 --> 01:48:52,204
...like Roman fucking centurions.

1288
01:49:12,375 --> 01:49:14,475
Pour me one, will you?

1289
01:49:26,457 --> 01:49:29,357
Where were you hiding? Hiding?

1290
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:32,330
When Seppe cleared the room.
I was sittin' right here.

1291
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:36,320
I asked him if he wanted to work
for someone who'd be alive tomorrow.

1292
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:38,460
That's what it took?

1293
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:42,860
And you wanted to put a fuckin'
dunce like Digger in charge!

1294
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:46,076
You had a good thing goin' here
and you fucked it all up in one day.

1295
01:49:46,711 --> 01:49:48,311
You know how many people died here...

1296
01:49:48,421 --> 01:49:51,111
...because of your simple wop bullshit.

1297
01:49:51,388 --> 01:49:56,388
Maybe someday you'll have a son
and you'll understand.

1298
01:49:56,836 --> 01:49:58,336
Oh, I understand.

1299
01:50:00,197 --> 01:50:04,097
How is my son? Your son is dead now.

1300
01:50:59,153 --> 01:51:01,653
He would have killed
every last one of us.

1301
01:51:01,753 --> 01:51:03,353
Hunted us down, you know that.

1302
01:51:05,971 --> 01:51:08,671
They didn't expect to see old age.

1303
01:51:10,479 --> 01:51:12,279
Neither do I.

1304
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:20,100
I had this whole thing I was
going to say to Albert before I go.

1305
01:51:26,128 --> 01:51:27,895
Too late.

1306
01:51:33,509 --> 01:51:39,009
Alright, I don't want to see
anyone else get killed today.

1307
01:51:39,383 --> 01:51:40,983
Any of you guys want to die?

1308
01:51:42,329 --> 01:51:43,329
No, Mr. Coughlin.

1309
01:51:43,489 --> 01:51:46,589
Whoever wants to go back up
to Boston has my blessing, go ahead.

1310
01:51:47,930 --> 01:51:50,930
If any of you want to stay down here
where the sun is warm...

1311
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:54,323
...and the girls are pretty,
we got jobs for you.

1312
01:51:57,464 --> 01:51:59,677
But I'm finished.

1313
01:51:59,712 --> 01:52:01,865
If you want the boss, go to him.

1314
01:52:01,971 --> 01:52:03,582
He runs things now.

1315
01:52:06,269 --> 01:52:08,187
Any confusion on that?

1316
01:52:10,358 --> 01:52:11,485
Good.

1317
01:52:23,834 --> 01:52:25,856
Graciela.

1318
01:52:47,701 --> 01:52:50,417
Let's go. Clean up this fuckin' mess.

1319
01:52:50,497 --> 01:52:55,451
Dion ran the crew for eight years
and he was right.

1320
01:52:55,672 --> 01:52:57,905
He didn't see old age.

1321
01:53:50,688 --> 01:53:52,917
Say what you have to say.

1322
01:53:52,952 --> 01:53:54,356
So what?

1323
01:53:54,391 --> 01:53:57,103
You had the racket. You just
thought you'd make the best of it?

1324
01:53:58,744 --> 01:54:00,772
No. Then what?

1325
01:54:01,833 --> 01:54:03,707
What happened, Emma?

1326
01:54:10,302 --> 01:54:13,286
Well, once the coppers started
chasin' me, I said to the driver...

1327
01:54:13,386 --> 01:54:17,386
...the only way to get away was
to drive off the bridge but...

1328
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:20,611
...but he wouldn't listen. So?

1329
01:54:21,318 --> 01:54:23,035
So I shot him..

1330
01:54:24,198 --> 01:54:26,232
We went into the water. I swam out.

1331
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:28,832
Ran to the nearest
house with a light on.

1332
01:54:29,830 --> 01:54:34,596
He was a fisherman.
Oh, he was happy to take me in.

1333
01:54:35,174 --> 01:54:36,622
You didn't want to reach me?

1334
01:54:36,841 --> 01:54:39,344
If I put my head up,
they would have killed me.

1335
01:54:40,598 --> 01:54:42,036
I didn't owe you.

1336
01:54:42,348 --> 01:54:44,688
I mourned for you for years.

1337
01:54:44,769 --> 01:54:48,154
Why don't you tell me how bad
I'm supposed to feel for you?

1338
01:54:48,818 --> 01:54:52,031
Well, maybe if I had a Police Chief
father from a nice part of Ireland...

1339
01:54:52,115 --> 01:54:54,294
...but I just had to make do.

1340
01:54:54,367 --> 01:54:56,081
Did you ever love me?

1341
01:54:56,786 --> 01:54:58,846
We had a laugh, Joe.

1342
01:54:59,959 --> 01:55:04,074
Oh, sure there were moments but do
you have to make it something it wasn't.

1343
01:55:04,217 --> 01:55:05,507
Which was what?

1344
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:07,762
A lie.

1345
01:55:09,433 --> 01:55:11,767
You know we're not God's children.

1346
01:55:12,393 --> 01:55:16,066
We're not fairy tale people
in a true love book.

1347
01:55:16,567 --> 01:55:21,419
We dance like motherfuckers so
the grass can't grow underfoot.

1348
01:55:24,996 --> 01:55:28,171
I'm free, Joseph.

1349
01:55:29,334 --> 01:55:33,101
If you want to come by now,
you've got an open invitation.

1350
01:55:42,522 --> 01:55:45,195
We always had a lot of laughs.

1351
01:55:49,572 --> 01:55:51,601
I don't wanna be free.

1352
01:55:52,036 --> 01:55:53,414
Ah, come on!

1353
01:55:55,125 --> 01:55:56,964
That's all we ever wanted.

1354
01:55:57,584 --> 01:56:02,024
That's what you wanted
and now you got it.

1355
01:56:07,812 --> 01:56:09,630
Goodbye, Emma.

1356
01:56:41,485 --> 01:56:44,822
We built Graciela's casitas for
abandoned women and children...

1357
01:56:44,906 --> 01:56:46,941
...who needed a place to stay.

1358
01:56:48,744 --> 01:56:51,208
We named our son after my father.

1359
01:56:56,007 --> 01:57:00,015
He was thoughtful,
kind, like his mother.

1360
01:57:24,381 --> 01:57:26,007
Repent!

1361
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:37,000
Repent!Repentance.

1362
01:57:39,611 --> 01:57:41,527
Repent!

1363
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:46,993
Repent!

1364
01:57:57,262 --> 01:58:00,603
Is that for me? Come here, sweetheart.
Come to your papa.

1365
01:58:00,687 --> 01:58:03,771
Repent!

1366
01:58:03,855 --> 01:58:05,734
Tomas. Repent!

1367
01:58:07,613 --> 01:58:08,947
Repent!

1368
01:58:09,824 --> 01:58:11,410
Repent!

1369
01:58:12,537 --> 01:58:13,662
Repent!

1370
01:58:30,355 --> 01:58:32,056
Are you alright?

1371
01:58:36,279 --> 01:58:37,778
Oh, no!

1372
01:58:38,407 --> 01:58:39,968
Oh, no!

1373
01:58:43,831 --> 01:58:45,962
Oh, no!

1374
01:58:55,516 --> 01:58:57,643
Oh, no!

1375
01:58:58,212 --> 01:58:59,312
Oh, God, no!

1376
02:00:05,288 --> 02:00:08,084
On Saturdays,
I take my son to the shows.

1377
02:00:10,587 --> 02:00:13,450
Hi, two for...

1378
02:00:15,510 --> 02:00:17,722
Thank you.

1379
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:22,561
Some little German guy's makin'
trouble overseas.

1380
02:00:22,646 --> 02:00:25,645
I don't believe they'll
fight another war, though.

1381
02:00:26,527 --> 02:00:27,945
No percentage in.

1382
02:00:34,703 --> 02:00:36,542
My son loved the show.

1383
02:00:38,878 --> 02:00:42,344
It was about an honest
sheriff in a dirty town.

1384
02:00:49,269 --> 02:00:53,261
All he could talk about was gettin'
his own badge when he grew up.

1385
02:01:00,534 --> 02:01:02,164
That's my brother. Huh!

1386
02:01:03,959 --> 02:01:06,572
That was my brother's name.

1387
02:01:07,004 --> 02:01:08,578
That's your uncle.

1388
02:01:12,259 --> 02:01:15,760
In the afternoons,
we fish for redfin and snook.

1389
02:01:23,111 --> 02:01:27,155
One day, my son asked me
"Where is heaven in the sky?"

1390
02:01:29,368 --> 02:01:31,580
And I told him what Loretta told me.

1391
02:01:36,964 --> 02:01:40,334
"This is heaven, right here."

1392
02:01:42,596 --> 02:01:44,637
"We're in it now."
