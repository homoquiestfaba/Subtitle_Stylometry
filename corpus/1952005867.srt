1
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:21,461
Randall, I'm afraid I gotta take
two of your boys back into town with me.

2
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:24,327
You're outside your jurisdiction, marshal.

3
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,833
And you're trespassing on my land.

4
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,837
They murdered that fellow from Chicago,
and then they raped and killed his wife.

5
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,907
I'm taking them in.

6
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:37,945
No.

7
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:39,604
I can't spare them.

8
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:56,065
Them two on the end. Cut them out.

9
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,597
Do like I tell you.

10
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:02,588
Like my father, I'd been West Point,
and I was good at soldiering.

11
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,394
But soldiering didn't allow
for much expansion of the soul.

12
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:10,232
So after the War Between the States
and a year of fighting Indians...

13
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:15,207
... I turned in my commission and rode away
to see how much I could expand it.

14
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:19,207
First time I met Virgil Cole
was when I and my eight-gauge...

15
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:21,509
... backed him up in a showdown
he was having...

16
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:23,777
... with some drunken mountain men.

17
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,945
Virgil asked me on the spot
if I'd care to partner up with him...

18
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,353
... and his peacekeeping business.

19
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:33,791
Which is why I was with him now,
and why I still carry the eight-gauge.

20
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:38,861
We'd been keeping the peace together
for the last dozen years or so.

21
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:42,566
And as we looked down
on a town called Appaloosa...

22
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,435
... I had no reason to doubt
that we'd be doing just that...

23
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,906
... for the foreseeable future.

24
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:53,574
But life has a way of making the foreseeable
that which never happens...

25
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,380
... and the unforeseeable
that which your life becomes.

26
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:23,639
The black hat. Must be Cole.

27
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,277
They're here.

28
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:34,890
Howdy.

29
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,094
Jack Bell and his deputies
went up to Bragg's place...

30
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:42,663
...to arrest the men
that murdered Clayton Poston...

31
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,424
...and raped and killed his wife.

32
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,468
And Jack Bell and his deputies
were never seen again.

33
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:52,597
I knew Jack Bell. He was a good man.

34
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:54,606
This fella, Bragg...

35
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,043
...what's his story?

36
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,942
He says he's from New York City.

37
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:03,484
Claims that he worked with Chester Arthur
in the customs office up there.

38
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:05,814
Chester Arthur,
President of the United States?

39
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:08,219
That's what Bragg claims.

40
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,949
What the hell's he doing out here?

41
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:11,821
- He's after the copper fields.
- Earl.

42
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:13,622
- What?
- Let Abner speak, please.

43
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:15,320
He is speaking.

44
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,602
The mines shut down back in '75
because of the Apache problem.

45
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:22,931
We finally made a deal...

46
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:26,166
...with a company out of Chicago
to get the operation going again.

47
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:27,434
A fair deal, mind you.

48
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,238
Then this murdering scoundrel
turns up and...

49
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,744
- Phil.
- What?

50
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,077
Our investors pulled out
right after the killings.

51
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,448
Bragg and his men
have got us all running scared.

52
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:42,055
They buy supplies in my store
and they don't pay for them.

53
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:43,685
They harass our women.

54
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,522
They use horses from the livery
and don't bring them back.

55
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:49,096
They eat and drink whatever they like
and never pay.

56
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:53,634
They've been living off of us
like coyotes live off a buffalo carcass.

57
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:56,670
Everything that eats meat
likes a dead buffalo.

58
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:04,713
Mr. Cole, Mr. Hitch...

59
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:09,716
...we want our town back,
and we are ready to pay your price.

60
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:13,617
What do you allow, Everett?

61
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:18,486
- What we do.
- It is, ain't it?

62
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,862
Then you'll do it?

63
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,233
- Sure.
- Oh, thank God.

64
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,993
Mr. Cole and I will do the gun work...

65
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,230
...but we're gonna button the town up
tighter than a nun's corset.

66
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:32,237
We need you to make laws
we can enforce.

67
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:33,739
We got laws.

68
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,404
You're gonna have more.
We need a lot of laws to make it all legal.

69
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:43,050
Well, sure. I mean, if it seems reasonable,
we'll just put them right into the bylaws.

70
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:45,949
- No.
- No what?

71
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:59,567
It basically states
that whatever Mr. Cole says is law.

72
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:03,099
- This means you'd be running the town.
- It does.

73
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:05,433
We can't have that.

74
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:09,710
I mean, you're asking us, so to speak,
to turn the town over to you.

75
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,211
Far as I can see,
you're gonna turn it over anyway.

76
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:14,281
- Us or Bragg.
- Mr. Raines.

77
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,940
Not now, Tilda.

78
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,950
- Trouble in the bar, Mr. Raines.
- Tilda.

79
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:20,351
- It's Mr. Bragg's men.
Oh, Jesus, God.

80
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,083
There's four of them. They have guns.

81
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:30,264
Space for your signature
down at the bottom, gentlemen.

82
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,024
Oh, for God's sake, give me that.

83
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:37,428
So...

84
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:48,413
Sign the damn thing, Abner...

85
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:51,451
...so these men can do
what they came here to do.

86
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:20,541
You piss like a mare, Chalk.

87
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,117
Fat, give me another one.

88
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:33,922
Button them up.

89
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:41,160
- Who the fuck are you?
- Virgil Cole.

90
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:43,328
Virgil Cole?

91
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,469
No shit.

92
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:50,672
Hey, Chalk,
Virgil Cole wants us to button up.

93
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:56,611
Step a little closer, Virgil Cole,
and I'll piss in your pocket.

94
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,522
Fellas, I'm the new city marshal.
Put it away or lose it.

95
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:05,627
- Hey, Bronc, they got a new city marshal.
- Put your little contraptions away.

96
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,595
I'm gonna walk you down to the jailhouse.
I don't wanna spook the horses.

97
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,899
You ain't walking us nowhere, Virgil Cole.

98
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:26,646
You pull on me, either one of you...

99
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:28,040
...l'll kill you both.

100
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,410
Bullshit.

101
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:41,824
I ain't shooting, mister. I ain't shooting.

102
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:47,525
Give me your gun.

103
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,852
I warned them.

104
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,617
- Marshal.
- Morning, Mr. Olson.

105
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:47,058
Bragg and his men, some of them
were at the jail looking for you, sir.

106
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,958
Well, I ain't at the jail.

107
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:51,827
Yes, I can see that.

108
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:57,261
Get a better view of what's going on
sitting right here, don't we, Everett?

109
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,904
Mm-hm.

110
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,970
What should we do?

111
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:04,942
- About what?
- Well, about Bragg and his men.

112
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:06,843
Don't do nothing, Phil.

113
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,779
Oh, my God.

114
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:30,601
My name's Randall Bragg.

115
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,468
Virgil Cole.

116
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:36,868
I know who you are.

117
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:41,547
We need to talk.

118
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:43,651
The only thing I need from you...

119
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:47,087
...is what happened to Jack Bell.

120
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,551
Can't help you there, marshal.

121
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,762
I see the fellow with the shotgun there.

122
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,727
Eight-gauge.

123
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,727
Good idea, spreading out like that.

124
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,495
It is.

125
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:11,769
- You a drinking man, marshal?
- Not so much.

126
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:14,739
And, uh, Mr. Eight-Gauge over there?

127
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,908
Mr. Everett Hitch.

128
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,654
You a drinking man, Everett?

129
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,790
Not so much.

130
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,021
Hard to like a man
who doesn't drink a little.

131
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:28,425
But not impossible.

132
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:32,290
Well, we'll see.

133
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,039
- You shot three of my men.
- Matter of fact, I only shot two.

134
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,700
Mr. Hitch shot the other one.

135
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:47,338
Point is, I can't have my hands
coming in here and you boys shooting them.

136
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,108
I can see how you'd feel that way.

137
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:52,152
So we need to make an arrangement.

138
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:53,879
There's a set of bylaws...

139
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:57,219
...posted right outside the door here
of this very saloon.

140
00:12:57,393 --> 00:13:00,624
Your boys do like the bylaws say,
everything will be muy bueno.

141
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:05,161
- And if they don't?
I arrest them.

142
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:10,435
- And if they don't go along?
- I shoot them, or Mr. Hitch does.

143
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,403
- That's the law.
- Your law.

144
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,236
The same thing.

145
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:17,776
Hm.

146
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,244
Maybe you aren't good enough.

147
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,211
Don't be so sure you're quicker than me.

148
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,721
So far I've been quick enough.

149
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:41,359
Well...

150
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:44,765
...perhaps now is not the time.

151
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:49,538
Don't mean there won't be a time.

152
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,947
See you and your boys there are heeled.

153
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:56,880
I know you haven't had a chance
to read the bylaws yet...

154
00:13:57,052 --> 00:14:00,180
...but the bylaws say it's illegal
to carry guns inside town limits.

155
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:03,723
So next time I'm gonna have to disarm you,
lock you up for a bit.

156
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,765
You are an interesting man, Mr. Cole.

157
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,131
Come on.

158
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:31,478
Mr. Cole's been doing this
a long time, Mr. Olson.

159
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:34,680
Oh, yeah, ahem. Thank you.

160
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:38,952
- Good day to you.
- Good day, Mr. Olson.

161
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,696
- Thank you, that'll be fine. I'll be back.
- Yes, ma'am.

162
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:40,104
Coffee and a biscuit, please.

163
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:41,977
No sell.

164
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:44,884
- But it's on the menu.
- With breakfast.

165
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:46,453
Chin.

166
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:49,854
- Sell the lady a biscuit.
- Menu say...

167
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:52,016
Sell her a biscuit.

168
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:54,257
One time.

169
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:59,757
Thank you.
- My pleasure.

170
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:04,028
Are you the sheriff around here?

171
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,237
City marshal.

172
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:08,205
Virgil Cole.

173
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,977
Now, this fella here's my deputy,
Everett Hitch.

174
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,579
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?

175
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:23,915
Thank you.

176
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:28,196
Thanks, Chin.
You're welcome.

177
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:51,514
Excuse me. Could either of you gentlemen
direct me to a clean, inexpensive hotel?

178
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:55,214
- We only have one.
- Is it expensive?

179
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,689
Probably more than it should be,
there being no other choice.

180
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,522
I only have a dollar.

181
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:02,728
Do you have a name?

182
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:05,130
Mrs. French.

183
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:07,925
Allison French.

184
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:11,963
Thank you.

185
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:18,277
Uh, you have a husband, Mrs. French?

186
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:20,105
He died.

187
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,351
I'm sorry to hear that.

188
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,516
You do any kind of work?

189
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,020
I play the organ and the piano.

190
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,419
You're not a whore?

191
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:34,991
- What?
- Don't be crude.

192
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:37,359
Well, no sense
fluffing your feathers about it.

193
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,195
We don't see a lot of single women here
that ain't whores.

194
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,563
Well, I'm one.

195
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:43,932
Sprightly thing.

196
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:48,203
Do you think the hotel
will let me stay for a dollar?

197
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,403
You can stay as long as you like,
Mrs. French.

198
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:55,507
- Now, how can that be?
- Might even hire you to play the piano.

199
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:57,982
- Think so, Everett?
- I do.

200
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,589
Well...

201
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:09,590
When you finish your breakfast...

202
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:12,996
...Everett will escort you down to the hotel
and help you get settled.

203
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:14,499
It'll be my pleasure.

204
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,228
Thank you very much, Mr. Cole.

205
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,808
- For your kindness.
- No trouble at all.

206
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:28,940
- Hope to see you again, Mrs. French.
- Yes, Mr. Cole. That would be nice.

207
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:49,530
You been gone a while.

208
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,769
She was asking a lot about you, Virgil.

209
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,806
Well, was she asking in a liking way?

210
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,251
- Wanted to know if you were married.
- Well, what'd you tell her?

211
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:38,977
Said I didn't know.

212
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:41,916
Well, hell, Everett,
you see a wife around here?

213
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,114
I do not.

214
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:45,624
Then why the hell did you tell her
you didn't know?

215
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:49,924
You might have a wife in Silver City.
Or in Nogales. Or Bisbee.

216
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:54,501
Bisbee? Everett, if I had a wife in Bisbee,
don't you think you'd know about her?

217
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,937
Allie says she's gonna ask you about it,
so you might wanna have an answer ready.

218
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:04,576
I had an Apache woman
come live with me once...

219
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:07,510
...but there were never any words
spoke over us or anything.

220
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,174
I think she wants to know...
She's more interested...

221
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,944
...in if you're presently married.

222
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,111
Well, hell no, I'm not presently married.

223
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,519
She's gonna be pleased.

224
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:24,055
Allie?

225
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:30,130
Yes, Allie. She likes to be called Allie.

226
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:39,643
So, what do you think?

227
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,909
I think Mrs. French... Allie.

228
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:46,714
- might become exclusively interesting.

229
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,721
I mean, what do you think
about the men on the ridge?

230
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,587
I think you and me might wanna
ride up there, see what they're doing.

231
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:58,663
Can I finish my coffee first?

232
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,825
You surely may.

233
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:10,877
Howdy, boys.

234
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:15,780
Town don't come out this far, marshal.

235
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:17,418
By God, I believe you're right.

236
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,713
I believe it ends
at the bottom of that hill...

237
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:20,980
...where that wash runs.

238
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:24,057
Up here,
you're just another cowboy with a gun.

239
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,693
You think that's right, Everett?

240
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:29,456
I think no matter where you are,
you're not just another cowboy with a gun.

241
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:30,791
That'd be my thought.

242
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:35,300
Well, we ain't doing nothing wrong,
and you ain't got no "jurdiction" up here.

243
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:37,601
"Jurdiction"?

244
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,664
I believe he means jurisdiction.

245
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:43,174
I believe he does,
and he's by God right about it.

246
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:45,609
What are you doing
riding round and round up here?

247
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,045
We're just keeping an eye on things.

248
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:49,843
For who?

249
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,890
Ow!

250
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:00,654
You knocked my teeth out.

251
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:04,458
Well, Colt makes a heavy firearm.
That's a fact.

252
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,993
Who are you riding for?

253
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:09,097
Bragg.

254
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:12,465
- Think Bragg's attempting to frighten us?
- Be my guess.

255
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,767
What's your name?

256
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:14,966
- Dean.
- Well, Dean...

257
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:18,078
...go back to Mr. Bragg
and report that we ain't too frightened.

258
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:20,612
Mr. Bragg ain't gonna like
that you hit me.

259
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:24,047
I don't guess you liked it
all that much yourself, Dean.

260
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:28,121
- You're damn right.
- So you and Mr. Bragg can commi...

261
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:31,552
- What word am I trying for?
- Commiserate?

262
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:35,253
You and Mr. Bragg
can commiserate each other.

263
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:38,422
You son of a bitch.

264
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:42,563
Hard to believe Jack Bell
got himself killed.

265
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:48,407
Well, what do you think happened
between him and Bragg?

266
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:53,042
- Overconfident?
- Be my surmise.

267
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:54,881
Mm-hm.

268
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,679
Probably thought Bragg
had some respect for the law.

269
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,116
Mm-hm.

270
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:02,256
Ain't just gunplay.
You know that, Everett.

271
00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:04,949
You gotta think about men too.

272
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:10,561
Guess that'd be one reason you're here
and Jack Bell isn't.

273
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:14,293
Well, that'd be one reason.
You'd be another.

274
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:33,151
Mighty fine piano playing. Mighty fine.

275
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:35,312
Why, thank you.

276
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:39,654
- Thank you. Oh, that's plenty.
- Little bit more?

277
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:41,728
It's plenty, it's plenty.

278
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:43,794
Thank you.

279
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:55,198
- To music.
- To music.

280
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:04,619
So tell me, Mr. Cole...

281
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:06,981
- Call me Virgil.
- Of course, Virgil.

282
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:10,420
How long have you been killing people
for a living?

283
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:15,020
Well, Allie, I don't kill people for a living.

284
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:17,256
I enforce the law.

285
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,993
Killing's sometimes
a sort of side thing of that.

286
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:24,229
That's not what I wanted to say.
What am I aiming at here, Everett?

287
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:27,500
- Byproduct.
- Killing's sometimes a byproduct.

288
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:30,469
And you've never killed anyone
except as a lawman?

289
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:32,272
Never.

290
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,675
Is he telling me the truth, Everett?

291
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:36,441
Virgil always tells the truth.

292
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,018
Oh, nobody always tells the truth.

293
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:42,156
- Why not?
- Well, they...

294
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:44,957
For heaven's sake, Virgil, they just don't.

295
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,721
Always thought the truth was simpler.
Tell a man what you mean.

296
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,757
And a woman?

297
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:55,468
- A woman?
- That's what I said.

298
00:25:57,105 --> 00:26:02,634
Well, Allie, I don't really remember
ever telling a woman anything.

299
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,142
Virgil Cole.

300
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:07,646
What?

301
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,183
Are you telling me
that you've never had a woman?

302
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:15,653
Well, hell, Allie, I don't think that's
something I should be discussing with you.

303
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,985
- But have you?
- Well, of course I have.

304
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,185
And did you never tell them anything?

305
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:26,367
Mostly, we just did
what we were there to do.

306
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:29,563
Which was what?

307
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:35,337
We won't talk about this anymore.

308
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:40,376
Oh, Virgil.

309
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,243
- I was just funning you.
- I didn't enjoy it.

310
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,684
Shit. Damn you.

311
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,448
Two more, Wallis.

312
00:26:49,624 --> 00:26:52,354
You scrawny little bastard,
where are you putting it all?

313
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,619
Hell, you ain't even pissed.

314
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:55,888
I can outdrink you
any day of the week.

315
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:59,192
Say when, Wallis.
When.

316
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,136
Shit. Shit.

317
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:09,839
- Shut up.
What's that, marshal?

318
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:12,571
- Get out of here.
- We ain't doing anything.

319
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,716
No, Virgil.

320
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,018
Virgil! Virgil!

321
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:28,288
Quit it!

322
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,790
Virgil.

323
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,926
Virgil.

324
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:39,436
You can let go.

325
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:48,282
You can let go.

326
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:19,771
Mr. Hitch,
may I have a word with you, please, sir?

327
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,210
Certainly.

328
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:25,581
Mr. Hitch, it's about the teamster
that Mr. Cole, uh...

329
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:28,120
Well, the teamster he busted up was...

330
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,156
Well, no, is a city employee, sir.

331
00:28:31,326 --> 00:28:33,624
- You might wanna take that up with Virgil.
- Uh, yeah.

332
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,992
Well, I thought you might be
more approachable.

333
00:28:37,165 --> 00:28:39,531
You know, more amenable.

334
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:42,431
We can't have law officers
beating people half to death...

335
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:43,764
...for no good reason.

336
00:28:43,938 --> 00:28:47,374
I took a bottle of whiskey to Tub
this morning, told him Virgil was sorry.

337
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:49,942
Well, perhaps he should have
taken it there himself.

338
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,511
Virgil doesn't do things like that.

339
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,275
Well, what he did, sir, was crazy.

340
00:28:56,451 --> 00:29:00,080
- You calling Virgil crazy?
- Yes. No. Uh...

341
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:01,279
Well, if...

342
00:29:01,456 --> 00:29:04,186
You think a man makes a living
as a gun hand isn't crazy?

343
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:07,988
- You're not crazy.
- Maybe. Maybe not.

344
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:10,894
Whatever I am, I'm not Virgil Cole.

345
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:13,693
It doesn't give him the right
to bust up innocent people.

346
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:14,892
No, it doesn't.

347
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:17,060
Mostly, innocent people
don't get busted up.

348
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:19,365
If they do,
it's because of who and what Virgil is.

349
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:22,908
And you hired him to be Virgil Cole.

350
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:26,008
I'm not sure I understand.

351
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:28,146
No.

352
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:31,215
I'm not sure you do either.

353
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:33,978
- Good day.
- Yes.

354
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,942
Abner.

355
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:58,768
- Morning, Abner.
- Morning.

356
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:04,736
- Morning, Everett.
- Well, good morning, Virgil.

357
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:10,343
- Morning, Tilda.
- Morning, Mr. Cole.

358
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:15,487
Thank you.

359
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,135
- Everything good with you and Allie?
- Lovely.

360
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:33,331
She is a lovely woman,
and everything's lovely between us.

361
00:31:33,508 --> 00:31:35,738
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

362
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,145
- Good morning, Everett.
- Morning.

363
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,887
Thank you.

364
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:56,389
There you are.

365
00:31:57,098 --> 00:31:58,690
Thank you.

366
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,032
Guess what, Everett?

367
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:05,570
What?

368
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,205
You know that house that's being built
on the east end of South Street?

369
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:10,401
Uh-huh.

370
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:13,672
Well, Mr. Olson was having it built
for his daughter and her husband.

371
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,713
- Right.
- But they're moving to Virginia.

372
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:19,709
- So he's gonna sell it.
- Well...

373
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:22,188
To Virgil and me.

374
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:26,656
It's gonna be
the most beautiful house in town...

375
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:29,388
...with a parlor and a white picket fence.

376
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:33,056
And a big porch
so we can see who's coming to call.

377
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:37,136
Well...

378
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:43,140
How about that?

379
00:32:54,822 --> 00:32:56,312
I ain't... I ain't armed.

380
00:32:58,092 --> 00:32:59,787
My name is Whitfield.

381
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:02,759
I'm Joe Whitfield
and I'm a hand over at Bragg's place.

382
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,704
Allie, I'm gonna need to talk to this fella
alone for a minute.

383
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:12,305
Oh.

384
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,505
Well, certainly.

385
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:18,701
Have to do my piano exercises anyway.

386
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:26,578
I was up on the rim
when you and your deputy...

387
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,314
You came up and smacked Dean.

388
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:35,018
I took on because...

389
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,392
I took on because Bragg
was supposed to be running cattle.

390
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:41,194
- And that's what I know.
- What are you driving at, son?

391
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,430
I was at Bragg's place when Marshal Bell
and his deputies was killed.

392
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:49,438
Who done it?

393
00:33:50,812 --> 00:33:52,473
Bragg done it.

394
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,278
You saw Randall Bragg shoot Jack Bell?

395
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,512
Yes, sir. And his two deputies.

396
00:34:00,688 --> 00:34:03,020
He shot them all dead
like they was rattlesnakes.

397
00:34:03,191 --> 00:34:04,920
Sit down there.

398
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,625
Sit down.

399
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:14,697
I don't want no part in killing people.

400
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,104
You testify to what you saw?

401
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,805
Yes. Yes, sir.

402
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,466
- With Bragg looking right at you?
- I will.

403
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:27,943
Because we don't wanna go up there,
shoot up a bunch of people...

404
00:34:28,116 --> 00:34:30,914
...and get Bragg into court
to have you dry up and blow away.

405
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:33,144
I'll say what I saw.

406
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,146
Give me your word on that?

407
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:39,616
I do.

408
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,453
You're under arrest
for the murder of Jack Bell.

409
00:36:19,627 --> 00:36:21,492
Don't make a sound.

410
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:27,899
- You can't do this, Cole.
- Yeah, well, I'm doing it.

411
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:29,468
Let's go.

412
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,183
Get on your horses. They've got Bragg.

413
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,366
Keep that gun on him, Everett.

414
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:04,335
Come on over there.

415
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:25,316
You try anything, you're a dead man.

416
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,686
What you like us to do, Mr. Bragg?

417
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:30,854
Tell them to lower their guns.

418
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:34,000
Hold off, Vince.

419
00:37:34,268 --> 00:37:36,202
Lower your guns.

420
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:40,039
Lower your guns.

421
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:16,372
Tell them not to follow
or I'll blow your jaw off.

422
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,637
- Vince.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Bragg?

423
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:21,281
Don't let them follow,
you understand? Stay put.

424
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:23,914
If you say so, Mr. Bragg.

425
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,160
- Out of the way.
- Stop it.

426
00:38:47,274 --> 00:38:50,334
- It's Mr. Bragg.
- Yes, it is.

427
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:53,780
They have him well in hand.

428
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:58,209
Circuit judge don't come through
for two and a half weeks.

429
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:01,787
You're wasting your time, Cole.
You've got no proof.

430
00:39:14,702 --> 00:39:16,294
You're a dead man.

431
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,766
That's not very neighborly.

432
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,669
You're dead.

433
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:30,108
You'll never hang me, Cole.

434
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:33,520
Never's a long time, Mr. Bragg.

435
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,923
I'm gonna go check on Allie.

436
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:48,057
First sign of any trouble,
fire off a couple rounds, I'll be here.

437
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:50,303
Unless you're riding at a hard gallop.

438
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,935
Everett, we've known each other
a long time.

439
00:39:57,111 --> 00:40:00,342
I don't care for that kind of dis... Dis...

440
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,478
- Disparaging?
- Disparaging remarks.

441
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,983
Especially about Allie.

442
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,585
No, and you shouldn't.

443
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:15,787
I apologize.

444
00:40:15,963 --> 00:40:17,897
You meant no harm.

445
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:20,434
Apology accepted.

446
00:40:36,283 --> 00:40:38,683
I know you're scared, son.

447
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:44,353
You keep your word and testify,
I promise we'll get you out of here safely.

448
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,857
Thank you, sir.

449
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:52,892
You're welcome.

450
00:41:42,116 --> 00:41:45,244
Allie's chewing on me like a young dog.

451
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:50,185
Says all I do is be a marshal,
sit around minding our prisoner.

452
00:41:50,357 --> 00:41:52,325
That I care more about marshaling
than her.

453
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:55,724
That I ain't even brung you down
to see the house yet.

454
00:41:57,298 --> 00:41:59,493
I was figuring to see it
when it's all finished.

455
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,692
Well, go on down there, will you?

456
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:03,632
Calm her down a little.

457
00:42:03,804 --> 00:42:06,534
You know, tell her you like it.

458
00:42:08,342 --> 00:42:09,366
What do you got there?

459
00:42:09,543 --> 00:42:13,445
She asked me which one I liked
for the curtain.

460
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,638
Mm-hm.

461
00:42:14,815 --> 00:42:18,342
Everett, I ain't... I never owned a house.
I didn't know what to say to her.

462
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:22,514
If the wind picks up, house'll blow down
and you won't have to worry about it.

463
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,148
That house ain't going nowhere.
I got a carpenter that used to build boats.

464
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:29,854
Will you go on down there, please?
Go on.

465
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,521
Just... You know,
she's planning the furniture.

466
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,065
All right.

467
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:35,793
Here, take these with you.

468
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,030
Tell her she can pick
whichever one she likes.

469
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,204
You know, I'm kind of partial
to this one here, but look.

470
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:46,175
Look at that.
You can see right through it.

471
00:42:49,683 --> 00:42:52,345
Kind of small for curtains, aren't they?

472
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,179
Get on down there.

473
00:43:15,776 --> 00:43:17,607
Everett.

474
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:20,046
Afternoon, Allie.

475
00:43:20,914 --> 00:43:22,882
I must look awful.

476
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:27,248
- You look lovely. Always do.
- You're too kind, Everett.

477
00:43:28,722 --> 00:43:31,623
Virgil said you should
pick out the curtains.

478
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,025
Couldn't make up his mind.

479
00:43:37,264 --> 00:43:38,788
House is hurrying right along.

480
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:42,026
Virgil ever decides to come and live in it.

481
00:43:42,503 --> 00:43:44,232
Pretty sure he will.

482
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:46,600
Doesn't pay any attention to the house.

483
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:50,107
Hell, Everett,
he doesn't pay any attention to me.

484
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:55,338
Just sits up in his jail with his gun...

485
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:57,347
...being the marshal.

486
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:02,421
Well, has been somewhat expectant
of late.

487
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,356
Yeah, but it's his job.

488
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:07,551
It's not his life.

489
00:44:11,498 --> 00:44:14,990
- Yeah.
- It'll be so elegant.

490
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:16,863
Come see.

491
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,697
This is the parlor...

492
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:23,104
...so we can look out
and see everybody who's coming to call.

493
00:44:25,312 --> 00:44:27,837
Come and see this. Come and see.

494
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:32,178
That will be the bedroom,
and this will be the kitchen.

495
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:35,113
And you'll come often to visit us?

496
00:44:35,522 --> 00:44:36,955
Every time I'm invited.

497
00:44:37,124 --> 00:44:39,490
I can cook, you know.

498
00:44:40,728 --> 00:44:42,787
I never imagined you couldn't.

499
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,301
Do you think I'm pretty?

500
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,300
Well, yes.

501
00:45:12,893 --> 00:45:16,021
Allie, you're with Virgil.

502
00:45:16,263 --> 00:45:17,389
So am I.

503
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:21,296
Virgil's not here.

504
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:27,204
We're not with each other.

505
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:30,742
We're both with him.

506
00:45:33,213 --> 00:45:35,078
Let go of me.

507
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,350
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Let go.

508
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,818
- Allie.
- Let go.

509
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:53,332
Just leave.

510
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,198
- We come for Mr. Bragg.
You can't have him.

511
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,367
Everett, step on in the office
with that eight-gauge.

512
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,207
First anything happens,
you blow Mr. Bragg's head off.

513
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,747
- Yes, sir.
- We'll take him if we have to.

514
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:45,248
If you do, he'll be dead.

515
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,191
We know you're good, Cole,
but you're not as good as 20 of us.

516
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:52,882
You know the arrangement, boy.

517
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,251
First one of you
does an ineluctable thing...

518
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:57,556
You shoot him,
you think we're gonna ride away?

519
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:58,823
Nope.

520
00:46:59,933 --> 00:47:02,265
- We'll kill you and Hitch.
- You'll try.

521
00:47:02,436 --> 00:47:04,700
You're willing to die
to keep us from taking him?

522
00:47:04,872 --> 00:47:06,430
Sure.

523
00:47:07,674 --> 00:47:09,665
Hitch. You willing to die too?

524
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:14,405
Of course he's willing to die. You think
we do this because we're scared to die?

525
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:16,673
You got them turned.

526
00:47:17,117 --> 00:47:18,812
They're arguing with him.

527
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:20,686
You?

528
00:47:20,954 --> 00:47:21,978
Me?

529
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,147
You afraid to die?

530
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,992
- I ain't afraid.
- Good, because you go first.

531
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,530
And that boy with the red scarf
goes next.

532
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:37,831
You go on home, Vince.

533
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:40,863
You go on home.

534
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,803
Go on. Too many people die if you don't.

535
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:46,812
Go on. Get on.

536
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,778
Go. Get. All of you, get out of here.

537
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,851
- There'll be another time, Cole.
Get out of here, get. Hyah!

538
00:47:53,253 --> 00:47:54,584
Hyah!

539
00:47:56,356 --> 00:47:58,085
Virgil?

540
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:04,389
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right, Allie.

541
00:48:05,232 --> 00:48:07,132
Let's get you inside.

542
00:48:13,373 --> 00:48:15,170
What did you do?

543
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:20,203
- What do you care?
- What did you do?

544
00:48:26,753 --> 00:48:28,220
I ran off.

545
00:48:32,192 --> 00:48:35,218
- You say anything to Mr. Cole?
- No.

546
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:37,955
- You gonna say anything?
- No.

547
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,699
Virgil couldn't hear a thing like that.

548
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:48,207
I don't want him hearing about it
from you either.

549
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:51,208
He finds out, I'll know
who couldn't keep her mouth closed.

550
00:48:52,746 --> 00:48:57,080
There have been a few times
when you didn't want my mouth closed.

551
00:49:06,259 --> 00:49:09,717
What if she tells him
and says it was your doing?

552
00:49:11,898 --> 00:49:13,525
Why would she do that?

553
00:49:14,134 --> 00:49:16,295
Sooner or later she's gonna tell him.

554
00:49:29,116 --> 00:49:33,018
Good morning, Tilda.
- Morning, Mr. Hitch.

555
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,520
Couldn't help but notice your books,
marshal.

556
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:47,158
What's the fascination with Emerson?

557
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:52,004
Not the most elegant writer,
but he gets his point across.

558
00:49:54,174 --> 00:49:57,735
Though I'm sure the layman
is sometimes a little befuddled...

559
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:02,439
...by his obfuscating vocabulary,
wouldn't you say?

560
00:50:02,616 --> 00:50:04,379
We've been treating you kindly, Bragg.

561
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:06,883
In return, we expect you
to speak when spoken to...

562
00:50:07,054 --> 00:50:09,113
...and otherwise keep your mouth shut.

563
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,123
I can speak if I want to.

564
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:13,851
Virgil and I can beat
the sweet Jesus hell out of you...

565
00:50:14,027 --> 00:50:16,894
...every morning for breakfast
if we want to.

566
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:32,010
Clyde Stringer, county sheriff.
My undersheriff, Charlie Tewksbury.

567
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:33,908
- Virgil Cole?
- Right there.

568
00:50:34,081 --> 00:50:36,276
Been expecting you, sheriff.

569
00:50:36,883 --> 00:50:38,316
Clyde.

570
00:50:38,919 --> 00:50:39,943
- Charlie.
- Morning.

571
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,020
This fella's my deputy, Everett Hitch.

572
00:50:42,189 --> 00:50:46,057
We just came in on a train from Yaqui
with Judge Elias Callison.

573
00:50:46,393 --> 00:50:51,160
This fella here's our witness.
Former hand of Bragg, Joe Whitfield.

574
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,797
- You're gonna testify?
- Yes, sir.

575
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:57,664
- lf he doesn't die of fright first.
- We been keeping him seque...

576
00:50:58,839 --> 00:50:59,863
Seq...

577
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,406
S... Seq...

578
00:51:05,278 --> 00:51:07,303
What's the word I'm looking for?

579
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:11,417
- Sequestered.
Sequestered here for safety.

580
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,384
Charlie and I'd be happy to help
till the trial's over if you need it.

581
00:51:16,556 --> 00:51:18,854
Might just take you boys up on that.

582
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,753
- Good morning.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

583
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:24,328
Going for a little buggy ride?

584
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:28,525
Yeah, me and Mrs. French
are gonna do a little perambulating.

585
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,202
Mr. Raines, Mr. May.

586
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:34,272
Morning, Everett.

587
00:51:34,441 --> 00:51:36,238
Got your goodies.

588
00:51:38,044 --> 00:51:41,013
- Sure you can handle this rig?
- Well...

589
00:51:44,785 --> 00:51:46,343
You know them?

590
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,179
The Shelton brothers.

591
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,847
They do law work?
They do gun work.

592
00:51:52,392 --> 00:51:55,020
- They good?
- They're excellent.

593
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:57,122
Good as you and me?

594
00:51:57,297 --> 00:51:59,424
Don't know that they ain't.

595
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,295
Don't appear to be heeled.

596
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:08,066
Well...

597
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,041
It's been a long time, Virgil.

598
00:52:13,747 --> 00:52:16,716
- Ring.
- You remember my brother?

599
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,680
Mackie.
- Virgil.

600
00:52:18,852 --> 00:52:20,319
Can I buy you a drink?

601
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:24,389
Are you still doing that?

602
00:52:24,858 --> 00:52:26,416
Well, we ain't.

603
00:52:30,163 --> 00:52:31,892
This is my deputy, Everett Hitch.

604
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,033
You as good as Virgil with a gun?

605
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:36,465
I never seen anybody as good as Virgil.

606
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:40,734
- But you ain't saying you ain't as good.
- Not discussing it, truth be told.

607
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,704
What are you and Mackie doing in town?

608
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:45,674
Everybody's gotta be somewhere,
don't they, Mackie?

609
00:52:45,846 --> 00:52:49,942
You got a trial coming up, a big one.
Might wanna take that in.

610
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,441
I like a good trial.

611
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:54,382
Good morning.

612
00:52:57,691 --> 00:52:58,851
This is Mrs. French.

613
00:53:00,327 --> 00:53:01,794
Ma'am.

614
00:53:02,729 --> 00:53:03,957
Gentlemen.

615
00:53:07,467 --> 00:53:09,094
Thank you.

616
00:53:11,738 --> 00:53:15,003
Well, you boys been in my towns before.

617
00:53:16,076 --> 00:53:18,169
You know the rules.

618
00:53:19,246 --> 00:53:20,645
Come on.

619
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,810
Haven't done this for a while.

620
00:53:26,052 --> 00:53:29,544
I always figured Virgil
for whores and squaws.

621
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,683
She's neither.

622
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:35,323
I'll be damned.

623
00:53:42,669 --> 00:53:44,034
We can try if you wanna.

624
00:53:44,437 --> 00:53:46,462
What happened next?

625
00:53:57,918 --> 00:54:00,546
Mr. Bragg shot the deputy dead
with his Winchester.

626
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,312
You're a goddamn liar!

627
00:54:07,694 --> 00:54:09,992
One more outburst
such as that, Mr. Bragg...

628
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:13,724
...and I will give Sheriff Stringer
the authority to shut you up...

629
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,663
...in any manner he sees fit.

630
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:19,669
With all due respect, Your Honor,
my client's life is on the line.

631
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,433
His life is not on the line yet, counselor.

632
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:27,568
He'll have his chance to speak. Sit down.

633
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:30,072
Go ahead, son.

634
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:36,948
Then Mr. Bragg shot Marshal Bell
and his other deputy.

635
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:41,822
You saw this happen
with your own eyes, son?

636
00:54:41,995 --> 00:54:43,553
Yes, sir.

637
00:54:45,465 --> 00:54:47,365
Thank you, Mr. Whitfield.

638
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,934
Mr. Mueller,
you may cross-examine the witness.

639
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:59,770
You swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

640
00:54:59,946 --> 00:55:00,970
I do.

641
00:55:05,852 --> 00:55:09,253
Well, Mr. Sullivan,
what have you got to say for yourself?

642
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:13,725
Jack Bell and his deputies
never came up to Mr. Bragg's ranch.

643
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,884
I don't know
what Whitfield's talking about.

644
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,053
That's the same thing
all of you have said.

645
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,827
Does anybody have
anything different to say other than:

646
00:55:23,003 --> 00:55:26,530
"Jack Bell and his deputies
never came up to Mr. Bragg's ranch...

647
00:55:26,706 --> 00:55:29,106
...and I don't know
what Whitfield's talking about"?

648
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:34,704
You may step down.

649
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:40,113
Well, no reason to waste time
saying the same thing over and over again.

650
00:55:40,286 --> 00:55:42,686
My client has a right to testify
in his own defense.

651
00:55:42,856 --> 00:55:45,416
Of course he does. One moment.

652
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,923
Mr. Whitfield...

653
00:55:48,395 --> 00:55:49,555
...do you own a horse?

654
00:55:49,729 --> 00:55:50,957
Yes. Yes, sir.

655
00:55:51,131 --> 00:55:53,725
Well, son, I suggest
while the bees are in the butter...

656
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,664
...you get on your horse and ride.

657
00:55:56,836 --> 00:55:58,929
Ride and don't look back.

658
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:03,800
- Now.
Ride hard, boy. Ride hard.

659
00:56:11,351 --> 00:56:12,750
Swear him in, Mr. Wallis.

660
00:56:16,556 --> 00:56:18,547
Put your hand on the Bible.

661
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,449
- Do you swear to tell the whole truth...
- I swear.

662
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,459
- so help you God?

663
00:56:25,832 --> 00:56:29,324
Your Honor,
I sense a certain antipathy toward...

664
00:56:29,502 --> 00:56:31,697
Sit down, Mr. Bragg.

665
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:35,204
I sense a certain antipathy
toward me here today...

666
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:37,969
...because I'm a relative newcomer.

667
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:43,277
Now, I didn't kill Jack Bell or his deputies.
Jack was a friend of mine.

668
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:44,815
I had no reason to kill him.

669
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:50,354
Mr. Whitfield is nothing more
than a fearful boy...

670
00:56:50,523 --> 00:56:53,981
...easily persuaded to say anything.

671
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,095
Easily persuaded by Marshal Cole.

672
00:56:57,597 --> 00:56:59,531
Now, the citizens of Appaloosa...

673
00:57:00,066 --> 00:57:04,025
...have allowed Mr. Cole
to take over their town.

674
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:09,241
But it is not justice
in this new nation of ours...

675
00:57:09,442 --> 00:57:13,378
...to allow him to deprive me
of my liberty...

676
00:57:13,746 --> 00:57:17,341
...let alone my life.

677
00:57:20,086 --> 00:57:22,577
Eloquent, Mr. Bragg.

678
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,087
But unconvincing.

679
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,527
I find you guilty of these charges...

680
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:32,698
...and sentence you to hang
at Yaqui Prison.

681
00:57:35,568 --> 00:57:36,694
Court's adjourned.

682
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,248
Everett?

683
00:58:01,294 --> 00:58:04,991
"What I must do is all that concerns me...

684
00:58:05,165 --> 00:58:07,633
...not what the people think.

685
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:15,569
This rule, equally arduous
in actual and in intellectual life..."

686
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,204
Arduous.

687
00:58:35,061 --> 00:58:38,087
We'll bring out sourdough and ham
when we get to Chester.

688
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,856
How long till Chester?

689
00:58:41,668 --> 00:58:43,659
Three quarters of an hour.

690
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:49,030
When we reach the upgrade,
you'll feel the train slow down.

691
00:58:49,209 --> 00:58:52,144
Ain't a hell of a grade,
but it's a long one.

692
00:59:03,223 --> 00:59:06,283
- We're just gonna take a look outside.
- I got him.

693
01:00:05,952 --> 01:00:08,113
So you see how this is gonna go.

694
01:00:10,223 --> 01:00:13,283
Any sign of trouble from anyone
and Mackie gives her both barrels.

695
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:17,720
Or she breaks her neck
and is dragged through the mesquite.

696
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:20,495
So you folks
are gonna have to unshackle Bragg...

697
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:24,034
...and parade him on out here
or she gets killed.

698
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,194
I got you in my sights.

699
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:29,239
Whatever happens to her, you're dead.

700
01:00:35,948 --> 01:00:40,009
What do you think, Virgil? You think
I'm gonna get scared and change my mind?

701
01:01:01,674 --> 01:01:03,141
Put your rifle down.

702
01:01:03,309 --> 01:01:04,742
Sorry, Cole,
this ain't your jurisdiction.

703
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,538
Put it down!

704
01:01:06,713 --> 01:01:07,805
You too, Everett.

705
01:01:15,021 --> 01:01:16,511
Charlie.
