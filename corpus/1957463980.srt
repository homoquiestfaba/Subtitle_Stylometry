how does this all work so

He was walking properly,
not standing on his tiptoes,

64
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,420
and there was no need
for anyone to help

65

him climb the stairs, which
was what usually happened.

naturally walk up and down

was unable to do this.

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,060
I can open my hand.

76

hurt anymore.

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,180
It is relaxed and cooperates
with the left hand much better,

which is very helpful.

83
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,730
It's not closed into a fist,
which bothered him a lot.

And when he wants
to give us a hug,

85

he used to do it
with only one hand.

don't have a full understanding

00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,950

occurring in our

00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,610
>> Virtually every ancient
culture and every native

116
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,540
culture has thought of
the universe as a unity,

117
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,350
as a circle, and man as
being central to that.

118
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,850
And it was only
with the discoveries

119
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,090
of Isaac Newton
and Rene Descartes

120
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,210
that ripped us out of the
fabric of our universe

121
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,360
and created this
clockwork model where

122
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,510
mind is separate from
body, and that we

123
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,550
are separate from each other.

124
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,280
And that idea of separation
is the foundation

125
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,185
of Western thinking.

126
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,020
Now Newton described a
very well-behaved universe

127
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,710
of separate things
operating in space and time,

128
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,520
according to fixed laws.

129
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,130
The idea of the body
as machine, the body

130
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,640
as this well-behaved
machine with the two

131
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,580
engines of the body being
the brain and the heart,

132
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:11,490
and the whole central orchestra
being conducted by DNA.

133
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,110
That's the model we have.

134
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,840
And we think of
various processes

135
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,350
being localized in
certain parts of the body.

136
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,620
What's wrong with that
is just about everything.

137
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,530
Body is completely
decentralized.

138
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,390
There is no central
brain, in a sense.

139
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,470
And that the brain is closer
to an antenna receiver.

140
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,020
It's closer to a transducer
of information, a receiver

141
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,789
and a transmitter
of information,

142
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,710
but not the central repository
of that information.

143

>> In our conventional world
of biochemistry and cellular

144
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,440

belief of a material world.

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,210
Through the history
of science, we've

146
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,440
focused on the
mechanical reality,

147
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,030
and have let go of the
concept of energy and fields

148
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,980
as information in biology.

149
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,400
That's the Newtonian perspective
that says, focus on the matter.

150
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,920
Don't pay attention to
the rest of the stuff.

151
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,590
Except that we're
now recognizing

152
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,440
that the mind, which is an
energetic field of thought,

153
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,800
which you can read with
EEG wires on your brain,

154
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,920
or even more interesting
is a new process called

155
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,070
magnetoencephalograph,
called MEG--

156
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,890
well, electroencephalograph,
you put wires on the skin

157
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,950
and read brain activity,
magnetoencephalograph

158
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,160
is a probe outside of the head.

159
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,490
And it reads the fields
of neural activity

160
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,279
without even touching the body.

161
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,820
So it basically says
that when you're

162
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,430
processing with your brain,
you're broadcasting fields.

163
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,290
>> 1875 to 1920 was
this enormous growth

of biochemistry.

165
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,910
And it was then thought that
chemistry is probably--you

166
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,710
know--

167
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,080
we're a chemical machine.

168
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,590
The answer is to put the
right chemical in the body,

169
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,820
and you'll get better.

170
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,860
To a point, that's correct.

171
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,730
But it doesn't appear to be
correct for chronic disease.

172
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,990
It's correct in the short term.

173
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,090
There was a major
intellectual split going on

174
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,450
at the time in physics,
because the old Newtonian

175
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,790
world, the clockwork
universe, was going strong.

176
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,280
And a few crackpots
in Denmark, Germany,

177
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,760
and to a lesser extent, England,
developed quantum physics

178
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,810
and said that it doesn't work
the way you said it works.

179
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,190
It doesn't happen like that.

180
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,420
And there were huge
anomalies found in physics

181
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,640
that could not be explained.

182
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,280
And the upshot of this
was that the old idea

183
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,040
of a mechanical universe,
where everything

184
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,380
happens for a specific reason in
its own way, had to be dropped.

185
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,640
>> Quantum physics changed our
perception of reality over 80

186
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,780
years ago.

187
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,630
Surprisingly, this
new viewpoint has yet

188
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,110
to be incorporated into
our current biology model.

189
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,510
>> The main problem with the
current biological model is

190
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,280
that it's reductionist
and mechanistic.

191
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,360
That means first, it tries
to explain everything

192
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,879
in terms of little bits.

193
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,420
Generally, molecules,
because they're

194
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,680
the smallest things
in organisms.

195
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,830
And secondly, it tries
to treat the organism

196
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,960
as a machine that
works simply in terms

197
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,120
of physics and chemistry.

198
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,570
>> Chemical reaction in the
body is supposed to be central,

199
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,800
and the main reason it occurs,
according to current theory,

200
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,650
is through molecular collision.

201
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,410
So that one molecule
collides into another,

202
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,740
and that's how they
have this information,

203
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,890
and how we have a cascade
of chemical processes.

204
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,640
Now if you think
of the usual cell,

205
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,070
a cell is like a swimming
pool, and molecules

206
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,190
are like a couple of tennis
balls in that swimming pool.

207
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,794
And according to this
theory, one tennis ball

208
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,210
is supposed to
find another tennis

209
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:58,710
ball in this vast body of water,
and do so instantaneously.

210
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,090
And that is supposed to
account for all the millions

211
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,280
of instantaneous activities
that occur in our body

212
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,740
at every second.

213
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,110
And that's ludicrous.

214
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,830
>> The existing control system
of modern medicine is enzymes,

215
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,300
hormones.

216
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,930
Not consciousness, not
emotions, not body field.

217
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,560
All that is there as
your control system

218
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,020
is enzymes and hormones.

219
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,800
And we find this a bit
inadequate to explain

220
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,576
the whole majesty of human
behavior and sickness,

221
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:31,700
and the whole darned thing.

222
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,030
It's impossible.

223
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,740
>> We look to science as
some sort of absolute truth,

224
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,110
and a story that's
already been written.

225
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,490
But the reality
is that science is

226
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,810
a story told in installments,
and every new chapter

227
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,910
oftentimes refines or completely
changes what has come before.

228
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,120
>> There's an intellectual
pendulum swing,

229
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,240
and it's swinging towards the
idea of holism and looking

230
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,590
at how an entire
system works together.

231
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,220
Whereas you say,
the doctors began

232
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,120
to look at how each
individual cell worked,

233
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,950
and they got down to
the cellular level.

234
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,730
That's all been
done for 100 years.

235
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,530
Great.

236
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,670
We understand it a lot.

237
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,030
But we don't understand how
the cells talk to each other

238
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,340
and how they deal
with information.

239
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,770
>> Today's medicine is all based
on a Newtonian paradigm where

240
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,460
they haven't taken into account
the implications of quantum

241
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,480
physics.

242
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,390
But once we start looking at a
different model of how matter

243
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,410
actually exists, it enables
the concepts of a body field

244
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,070
and how information and energy
can actually control biology.

245
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,820
And that has huge implications.

246
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,820
>> When I was 15 years old, I
had a very serious motorcycle

247
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,980
accident.

248
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,210
I was on a motorcycle I
shouldn't have been on,

249
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,560
and we were hit by
a car that caused

250
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,200
a very serious wound in my leg.

251
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,930
Ended up with 66 stitches.

252
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,030
At the point of
impact, I clearly

253
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,310
remember having an
out-of-body experience

254
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,790
where my consciousness
watched my body tumbling

255
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,980
through the air and
ultimately landing.

256
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,840
And it was sort
of shocking to me

257
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,090
when I kind of came
back into the body.

258
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,700
That said to me that perhaps
my consciousness isn't just

259
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,950
in my brain, but
that it is imbued

260
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,200
with more quality than that.

261
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,310
And then as I was facing
a very serious outcome,

262
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,720
they talked about
the possibility

263
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,510
of having to amputate
part of my leg.

264
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,980
I remember laying with a cast
from my hip down to my ankle,

265
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,660
and thinking about how
to rally my immune system

266
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,810
through my thoughts, such
that I could promote healing

267
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,860
in my leg.

268
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,860
And so I would lay on
the couch, and I would

269
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,810
visualize my immune system.

270
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,290
And I could feel it tingling.

271
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,480
I could feel the healing
happening in my leg.

272
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,400
And I didn't come
from a medical family.

273
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,300
I have no idea at all
where this idea came from.

274
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,770
But somehow, it was noetic.

275
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,850
It came directly to me, that
that was what I needed to do.

276
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,530
And ultimately, they
took the cast off,

277
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,246
and I'm a two-legged creature
still, thank goodness.

278
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,870
And so I think that
there was something

279
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,400
about my own personal
experience with that healing,

280
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,210
that there was something about
recognizing that my mind was

281
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,670
important to my body, and my
body was important to my mind,

282
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,395
that I just knew intuitively.

283
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:34,740
>> Mind, intention, belief.

284
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,410
Can these factors
influence healing?

285
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,140
>> If you think you have
an incurable disease,

286
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,460
if you think it
yourself, you are right.

287
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,100
If you think your
problem is curable,

288
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,470
then you are also right.

289
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,570
It all depends on
your intention.

290
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,870
>> When you think about
intention, what is intention?

291
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,870
And how does intention
play a role in healing?

292
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,790
Intention plays a
role when you think

293
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,170
about how our thoughts and our
emotions and our cognitions

294
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,890
influence our immune system
and our endocrine system.

295
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,660
And we know that this happens.

296
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,450
We know that people who feel
a tremendous amount of stress,

297
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:19,010
for example, have a
diminished capacity

298
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,620
in terms of their immune
systems functioning.

299
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,170
It's been discovered in the
laboratory over the last 15

300
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,700
or 20 years, for
example, that intention

301
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,960
does have physical effects.

302
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,440
>> So for example, we recently
conducted a study where we

303
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,340
recruited couples, one
of whom had cancer.

304
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,280
And we took the partner
of the cancer patient,

305
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,990
and we trained them
in what we call

306
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,170
the compassionate
intention program.

307
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,020
And so they were invited
in to participate

308
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,250
in a training program.

309
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,200
A lot of it had to
do with meditation.

310
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,480
It had to do with heart opening.

311
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,760
It had to do with
subtle energies.

312
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,950
And we took them through
this training program,

313
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,290
and then we asked them
to go home and continue

314
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:05,119
to practice this
intervention for eight weeks.

315
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,250
We brought them back and we
put them in our laboratory.

316
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,410
And we monitored the
patient in one room,

317
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,560
and we put them in a 2,000-pound
electromagnetically shielded

318
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,940
room so that there was no
possibility of electromagnetic

319
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,900
fields or the partner of the
cancer patient talking to them

320
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,510
on the radio or on their
cell phone and saying, OK.

321
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,280
Breathe deeply now.

322
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,290
We could rule out
any of those kind

323
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,680
of conventional explanations.

324
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,260
Meanwhile, the partner who'd
gone through the training

325
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,650
program sat in another
room and watched

326
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,530
the image of their loved one
on a closed circuit television

327
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,790
screen.

328
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,550
And then at random times
throughout the session,

329
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,360
they were asked to send
loving, compassionate intention

330
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,070
to the patient.

331
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,740
The idea was to see if we
could find correlations

332
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,380
between the intention
of the one person

333
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,800
and the physiological
activity of the other.

334
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,220
What we found is that there
was a significant correlation

335
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,250
in the physiological
activity of this person

336
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,050
and the physiological
activity of the other.

337
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,860
This suggests that there is
some way in which information

338
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,520
is transferred that
isn't accountable

339
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,910
by the conventional Newtonian
model of cause and effect.

340
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,830
You know, the partner
of the cancer patient

341
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,770
wasn't coming in and whispering
in their partner's ear,

342
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,735
calm down now.

343
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:28,100
Quite the contrary.

344
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,990
They were at a distance,
and there was no way

345
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,570
that the two people knew
when this kind of interaction

346
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,270
was happening, and
yet it happened.

347
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,770
>> Sending an intention
that I am better,

348
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,920
sending information with
belief that I am better,

349
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,820
is sending information to
the body to correct itself.

350
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,350
Because as we say, a thought is
an actual, physical energy too,

351
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,150
and it sends information
to the body as well.

352
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,120
>> It's been very well
demonstrated that our belief

353
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,040
system affects how we
behave and how we perform,

354
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,470
and it also affects
our lifestyle.

355
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,180
So if we don't believe
that we can help ourselves,

356
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,680
we probably could not.

357
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,220
If we don't believe that
positive information is

358
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,750
useful to our health
and well-being,

359
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,280
then it probably won't be.

360
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,640
>> Our thoughts create
our body moment by moment.

361
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,670
When we think positive thoughts,
we release certain chemicals

362
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,570
into our body.

363
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,330
When we think negative thoughts,
we release negative chemicals

364
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,780
into our body.

365
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,890
And those have a profound effect
on how the cells are behaving,

366
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,890
and how the nutrition
is being used.

367
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,910
It's very obvious to me,
working as an osteopath,

368
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,490
that the stress that
people hold in their body

369
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,660
has various patterns according
to how they're thinking.

370
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:55,360
>> Probably the most essential
aspect of healing is to believe

371
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,930
in the modality you're using,
and to stay positive in some

372
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,010
way.

373
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,750
There's so much evidence about
belief in a system of medicine

374
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,710
being crucial to the
effectiveness of that.

375
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,830
I used to say to
people who have cancer,

376
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,350
after researching the
limitations of things

377
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,810
like chemotherapy,
don't have chemotherapy.

378
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,240
It only works 9% of the time.

379
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,050
I don't do that anymore.

380
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:25,270
And the reason I don't is that
I believe that belief itself

381
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,610
is the body's
strongest medicine,

382
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,440
and if you believe
something is going

383
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,260
to work, regardless of what that
is, it's going to work for you.

384
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,220
There was a study in Houston
of some patients going

385
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,940
through a knee
operation for arthritis.

386
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,070
Half actually went
through an operation

387
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,110
where they were worked
on for their arthritis.

388
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,266
The other half were
given a sham operation

389
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:52,390
where they just opened the
knee, and then closed it

390
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,070
and did nothing.

391
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,530
They found over three
years of follow-up

392
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:01,120
that both sets of patients
reported having no pain.

393
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,120
So the patients where
nothing was done to them

394
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,400
still reported being pain-free.

395
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,859
Their arthritis was gone.

396
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:11,400
There have been
other studies looking

397
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,490
at if there's any difference
between going to the gym

398
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,890
and thinking about
going to the gym.

399
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,230
And with this study, they
took a group of people,

400
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,050
and they sent half to the
gym to work on their biceps,

401
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,170
and the other half were allowed
to sit in their armchairs

402
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,970
and just think about
going to the gym

403
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,710
and working on their biceps.

404
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,280
And they still recorded
a very strong effect

405
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,880
in the group who had just
sat in their armchairs.

406
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,220
The couch potatoes still
built up their biceps.

407
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,600
So the body really can't
distinguish between action

408
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,010
and thought.

409
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:49,530
And you see this most clearly
with the placebo effect.

410
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,990
>> Traditional Western
medicine typically attributes

411
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,890
spontaneous or miraculous
healing to placebo.

412
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,400
But what exactly is
the placebo effect?

413
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,610
>> The placebo effect is
the fact that a belief that

414
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,390
a person has can
override their biology.

415
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,400
Well, it's so
profoundly important

416
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,570
that science has recognized
that at least one third

417
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,390
of all healings, including
drugs and surgery

418
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,910
and other allopathic
interventions, one

419
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,090
third of all healings has
nothing to do with the process,

420
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,220
but has to do with
the placebo effect.

421
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,850
That a person believes that the
process is going to heal them,

422
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,580
and heals themselves in
spite of the fact that maybe

423
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,830
the pill was a sugar
pill, or the operation

424
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,930
was just a sham and wasn't real.

425
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,750
And why this becomes
important is clearly,

426
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,540
one third of all healings
occurs without anybody

427
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,330
doing anything other than
having a positive thought.

428
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,790
And what interests
me as a biologist

429
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,800
and former professor
in a medical school

430
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,130
is how we can talk about
the placebo effect for about

431
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,830
15 minutes in a
pharmacology course,

432
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,350
and then totally ignore
the relevance of thought

433
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,020
and mental processes
on biology for the rest

434
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,910
of medical education.

435
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,000
So that our doctors are not
really using the placebo effect

436
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,950
effectively, that we're not even
studying the placebo effect.

437
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,480
And right now, we could
cut the health care cost

438
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,950
by exactly one third by just
using the placebo effect.

439
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,150
>> It seems time that we began
to shift the lens and start

440
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,360
really focusing on, what is
the nature of the placebo?

441
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,390
How is it that you can take
an inert substance, something

442
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,410
that has no known
medicinal capacity--

443
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,090
you know, potential--
and that inert substance

444
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,210
not only can create
physiological changes

445
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,790
in the body, but
actually somehow

446
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,390
is able to manage a whole
cascade of responses

447
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,880
within a very
complex system, such

448
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,370
that it can target the liver
or the kidney or the lungs,

449
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,170
you know?

450
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,960
That is a great mystery, and
we don't understand that,

451
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,160
and much more needs to be done.

452
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,390
>> The placebo effect is really
another way of talking about

453
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,120
the body's
self-healing capacity.

454
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,760
And anything that
unleashes more of that

455
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,166
is going to be a better system.

456
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,897
>> I was absolutely
desperate to have children.

457
00:24:09,897 --> 00:24:11,980
It was one of the reasons
why I'd gotten divorced.

458
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,430
I wanted children,
and my husband didn't.

459
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,500
So I moved to London,
thinking it would take me

460
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,220
a maximum of two years to
find myself a new partner

461
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,620
and settle down, and I'd
be out in the country,

462
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,740
having my 2.5 children,
and I'd be totally happy.

463
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,850
That was my plan.

464
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,180
I was very good at making plans.

465
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,140
So there I was.

466
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,030
I had my osteopathic practice.

467
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,830
I was seeing clients.

468
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,910
And I was stressed,
frustrated, depressed.

469
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,740
And I had been having
headaches for years.

470
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,400
Maybe 10 years, I'd been having
these terrible headaches, which

471
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,230
were getting worse
and worse and worse.

472
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,870
Sometimes they lasted
as long as five days.

473
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,810
I had a routine
visit with my doctor,

474
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,879
and the doctor found
that my hormone level was

475
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:56,670
very much out of balance,
and I immediately

476
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,420
suspected that I had a tumor.

477
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,730
So I was sent for a
brain scan, and they

478
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,050
diagnosed a prolactinoma.

479
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,550
It was a huge shock.

480
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,620
Huge shock.

481
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,660
Out of the blue.

482
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,800
And I felt at first, how unfair.

483
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,330
I went off to the
medical library

484
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,260
and started to learn everything
I could about this tumor.

485
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,380
And when I discovered that it
caused infertility, I thought,

486
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,870
that is so ironic.

487
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,440
Every cell in my body was
saying, I want children,

488
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,110
and I had somehow
created a tumor that

489
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,510
stopped me having children.

490
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,190
There had to be some
reason for this.

491
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,240
There had to be--

492
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,280
this was too much of a
coincidence, I thought.

493
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,160
And I got very curious.

494
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,830
Because of my alternative
medicine background,

495
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,890
I decided to treat it
alternatively rather than

496
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,940
go for the orthodox
drugs or surgery.

497
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,450
>> Ariel decided to utilize
neurolinguistic programming,

498
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,510
or NLP, to approach her tumor.

499
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:01,850
>> So then I got into doing
NLP at a much deeper level.

500
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,740
Got through the master
practitioner level,

501
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,060
came home, and was
totally inspired

502
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,560
as to what I could actually do.

503
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,090
I started to really understand
what NLP was all about.

504
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,300
>> NLP is a practical
form of psychology,

505
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,360
which starts from where you are
now and looks at where you want

506
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,560
to be, and uncovers
what's in the way.

507
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,730
>> If you have, like
my five-day headaches,

508
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,280
and you'd like to be without
a tumor in your end state,

509
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,800
the journey to get from square
one to the end square is what

510
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,890
we actually start
exploring with NLP.

511
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,740
>> Ariel made some very
interesting discoveries she

512
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,410
began working with NLP.

513
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,290
>> Now remember, I was the
person who thought every cell

514
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,480
in her body wanted children.

515
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,170
And what I discovered was that
deep down, that going back

516
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,670
to early, early,
early childhood,

517
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:01,370
I had such an abhorrence of
what my family had been like

518
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,980
that the last thing in
the world part of me

519
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,540
wanted was to be a mother.

520
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,670
And this really,
really shocked me.

521
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,780
I thought I wanted one
thing, and in fact,

522
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,590
an unconscious part of me was
going in a completely different

523
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,640
direction.

524
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,410
And when I understood
the reasons

525
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,790
why it didn't want children
and what it was based on,

526
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,320
I was able to kind
of let go of that,

527
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,330
and allow it to be the way it
was, and at least understand

528
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:36,230
why I'd created a life that
didn't go down that path.

529
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:41,480
One day, I heard myself
shouting inside my head.

530
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,690
It was like this little voice
saying, I'm so sick of this.

531
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,050
I just want to be rid
of this whole nightmare.

532
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,780
I want to be rid of this tumor.

533
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,760
And I stopped in
shock as I listened

534
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,140
to this voice inside my head.

535
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,980
And I went, wow.

536
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,220
There's a lot of anger in
there, a lot of frustration.

537
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,160
That's a lot of self-attack.

538
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,240
If I'm attacking my tumor
with all those thoughts

539
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,750
of wanting to get rid
of it, that's murderous.

540
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,920
That can't be healing.

541
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,820
And I had never looked
at healing in that way.

542
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,910
And I realized then that
every thought I'd had

543
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,810
was actually about
making it go away.

544
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,490
Now that's a conflict.

545
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,040
That's a huge inner conflict.

546
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,500
And I decided to look at that
a little bit more closely.

547
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,420
And I thought, well, what
would be the opposite?

548
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,517
It has to be acceptance.

549
00:28:31,517 --> 00:28:33,350
And I thought to myself,
well, what would it

550
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,720
be like if I really
accepted this tumor?

551
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,870
And this was quite
a few years later,

552
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:44,390
but it was absolutely a
turning point in my healing

553
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,260
when I realized that my tumor
had taken me down a journey I'd

554
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,320
never planned.

555
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,080
It had taught me things I
had never intended to learn.

556
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,220
I had changed my career, I
had changed my whole outlook,

557
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,330
I had learned lots of things
about myself and others.

558
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,670
I had insights I'd
never had before.

559
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,550
I'd met amazing people,
wonderful people

560
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,080
all over the world.

561
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,470
I'd had the support of
people all over the world.

562
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:18,570
And I realized I liked
myself a lot better.

563
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,210
And so I thought, OK.

564
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,010
I can see that this tumor
hasn't been totally bad.

565
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,620
What if it has a purpose
or a reason for being here?

566
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,364
Because obviously, it's
done a good job so far.

567
00:29:30,364 --> 00:29:32,030
So if it's got a
purpose for being here,

568
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,745
and it's still here, maybe
there's still a purpose.

569
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,650
What would happen if
I gave it permission

570
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,165
to stay for the rest of my life?

571
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:48,050
It was six months after
I had that realization

572
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,630
and I got to the
point of accepting

573
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,510
the presence of my tumor,
I had my routine blood test

574
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,970
and went to see my specialist.

575
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:02,390
And to my surprise, my hormone
levels were completely normal.

576
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,960
And when my doctor saw
them, he just went, wow.

577
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,464
That's incredible.

578
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:09,380
And you know, I thought
it had been a mistake.

579
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,390
I thought maybe the blood test
reading was wrong or something.

580
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,520
I said, well, you know,
so much time has passed,

581
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,579
and I'm older now.

582
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,870
Maybe my hormones have changed.

583
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,270
He said, no, no, no, no.

584
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,300
Can't be that.

585
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,690
He said, this can
only mean one thing.

586
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,040
Your tumor has gone.

587
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,760
And he said, this is
a real credit to you.

588
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,290
I don't know how you've done it.

589
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,970
I don't know what
you've been doing.

590
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,300
But I have to tell you,
I've seen you for 10 years,

591
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:37,220
and you're not the same
person you were 10 years ago.

592
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,045
You are completely different.

593
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:47,510
>> So when we make
an emotional shift--

594
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,170
let's say we go from
frustration to joy,

595
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,740
those kind of emotional shifts--

596
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,970
about 1,400 biochemical changes
instantly go off in the body.

597
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,780
Now if you think about
the course of one day, all

598
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,310
the emotions that we feel,
the highs and the lows

599
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,340
and the myriad of
emotional textures

600
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,730
that occur through our
perceptions during a day,

601
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,130
you can see that emotions
are creating lots and lots

602
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,480
of changes in our physiology.

603
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,900
So it makes a lot of sense
to start paying attention

604
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,530
to the emotional diet as
well as to the physical diet.

605
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,480
That's one of the
keys to better health,

606
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,200
and certainly to slowing
down the aging process.

607
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,260
Strong negative emotions
just degenerate us.

608
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,600
Positive emotional
states regenerate us.

609
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,520
It becomes simple math.

610
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,550
Feel more love, more care, more
appreciation, and your health's

611
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,040
got a better chance of
improving and staying that way.

612
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:50,380
>> One of the most profound
discoveries made really since

613
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,335
the advent of quantum physics
is a thing called the zero-point

614
00:31:54,335 --> 00:31:55,135
field.

615
00:31:55,135 --> 00:31:58,180
And what this is is the
energy exchange that goes on

616
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,240
between subatomic particles.

617
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,970
All subatomic particles engage
in a little energy dance.

618
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,710
It's almost like playing
a game of basketball.

619
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,430
They send energy back
and forth to each other.

620
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,770
And in that exchange,
a thing called

621
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,500
a virtual particle
is created, just for

622
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,010
less than the blink of an eye.

623
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,650
Now that little individual
exchange isn't much energy.

624
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,720
It's about a half
a watt's worth.

625
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,700
But when you multiply all of
the subatomic particles doing

626
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,810
this energy exchange across
all things in all the universe,

627
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,530
you come up with this
unfathomable amount of energy,

628
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,160
all happening out
there in empty space

629
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,960
like some
super-charged backdrop.

630
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,560
>> While conventional biology
focuses on the material

631
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,000
stimuli, quantum physics reveals
that it's invisible stimuli

632
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,740
that are much more important.

633
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,410
There's a simple quote by Albert
Einstein that makes sense out

634
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:58,840
of this, and the quote is, "The
Field is the sole governing

635
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,076
agency of the particle."

636
00:33:01,076 --> 00:33:02,700
What Einstein meant
by this very simply

637
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,850
is "the field," the invisible
energy forces around us,

638
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,310
they are the sole
governing agencies

639
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,820
of the particle, or
the particle's matter.

640
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,490
And so quantum physics says,
the character of matter

641
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,570
is ultimately
determined by the field.

642
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,165
>> Healing occurs when
your body is able to access

643
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,130
the information it needs to
be able to operate itself

644
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,960
properly.

645
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,520
>> Walk into any great cathedral
in the United States and Europe

646
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,170
anywhere that's been standing
for hundreds of years or more,

647
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,800
and what you will experience
is in that cathedral is a hush

648
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,950
of awe, reverence, quiet.

649
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,588
And it's a palpable experience.

650
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,850
Why is that true?

651
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:56,440
It is true because
for hundreds of years,

652
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,070
the people going
into that cathedral

653
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,200
have been on their
best behavior.

654
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,840
They have been in
awe and worshipful,

655
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,190
and in a state of mind that the
quantum emissions from the body

656
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,090
brain are emitted
into that cathedral,

657
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:17,670
absorbed into that cathedral,
and fed back in later centuries

658
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,600
to the participants
coming into it.

659
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,140
And that's why they feel
the sense of hush, awe,

660
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,320
and reverence.

661
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,880
>> We're all part of
this giant energy field,

662
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,630
this zero-point field,
that we're all connected,

663
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,500
and that we're connected
across the furthest reaches

664
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,300
of the cosmos.

665
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:41,159
>> When you're
looking at the body,

666
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,447
it consists of over
70 trillion cells,

667
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:47,400
and somehow all of them
magically know exactly what

668
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,980
to do at exactly the right time.

669
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,350
And this actually cannot
be explained through normal

670
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,830
biochemical messages or even
nervous system impulses,

671
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,340
because the times involved
just simply don't add up.

672
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,900
This is where we
need the human body

673
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,320
field, which is an
information-structured energy

674
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,130
field.

675
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,250
And a way of looking at that,
if we take the normal Einstein

676
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:12,390
equation of E equals MC squared,
which means energy equals

677
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,420
matter times the speed of
light, what that is saying

678
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,290
is that all matter
is actually energy.

679
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,150
But it's missing one fundamental
thing, and that is actually

680
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:25,110
that all matter is
information-structured energy,

681
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,240
and that applies to biology too.

682
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,450
So when we're looking
at the body, what is it

683
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,680
that is actually coordinating
everything that's

684
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,210
going around in the body?

685
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,390
It's actually
information and energy.

686
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,850
And therefore, what's
really crucial in how

687
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,760
your body operates is to
look at the information

688
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,960
and energy of the body.

689
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,330
Watch an ice skater.

690
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,820
There are things
that they can do

691
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:54,100
that are not describable
in terms of nerve impulses.

692
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,490
Nerve impulses and
chemical reactions

693
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:03,310
are too slow to explain
the subtleties of life.

694
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,090
>> Even now if you look up
the textbooks in psychology,

695
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,690
in medicine, or biology, and
try to find out how the nervous

696
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,740
system works, you're confronted
with the discontinuity

697
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,630
of the system.

698
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,890
>> The nervous system is
comprised of neuron cells that

699
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:25,690
carry electrical and chemical
impulses throughout the body.

700
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,110
>> If you measure the impulses
of the nervous system,

701
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:33,140
we get some of them going
at 200 miles an hour,

702
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,820
whereas other of them
going at two miles an hour.

703
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,780
And I think those are the pain
reflexes that are very slow.

704
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,760
How on Earth the brain or
any other part of the body

705
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,510
can coordinate the nervous
system and your very fine

706
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:50,680
movement when these
impulses are supposed

707
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,300
to be traveling at
many different speeds

708
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,110
is just an impossible problem.

709
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,510
If you're a dancer,
for example, we're

710
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,830
moving in three dimensions,
and you're moving in time.

711
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,500
How on Earth that
person can coordinate

712
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,700
all of these important dance
steps is quite a mystery.

713
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,760
This seems to be impossible
with the contemporary model

714
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,090
of the nervous system.

715
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,280
We need a field
theory to explain

716
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,700
how the nervous system
in all its complexity

717
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,790
can coordinate everything
that happens in the body.

718
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,240
>> We now know when you study
nervous system activity that

719
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,310
the brain can start firing
synchronous pulses throughout

720
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,180
different areas of the brain,
virtually instantaneously.

721
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,400
The significance
of this coherence

722
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,710
of these pulses that begin
to fire when actually

723
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,920
consciousness is functioning
is when scientists

724
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,290
looked at how fast
you could coordinate

725
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,690
all these different areas
that we're focusing on

726
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,690
at the same time, that the
coherence of the firing

727
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,330
was faster than the
physical ability of cells

728
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,670
to communicate from
one area to the other.

729
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,400
So basically, these
results reveal

730
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,250
that the brain is
communicating on a higher level

731
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,400
than through the physical
transmission of nerves.

732
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,230
>> We're understanding that
the brain doesn't have precise

733
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,030
addresses for certain things.

734
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,590
No one's been able to find
where memory is, for instance.

735
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:21,040
And Karl Pribram did some
amazing studies years ago,

736
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,700
horrible studies where
they taught rats certain

737
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,750
runs, and then began
systematically destroying

738
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,340
the rats' brains.

739
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,950
And they found that no
matter how much of the brain

740
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:36,820
they removed, the rats might
have terrible motor skills

741
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,940
from that, but they would
still, over and over,

742
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,465
remember the run.

743
00:38:41,465 --> 00:38:44,080
And from that,
Pribram understood

744
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,670
that you couldn't
say that memory

745
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,930
has one precise address, that
it's much more delocalized.

746
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,410
And in fact, most
radically, that memory

747
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,770
might not exist inside the skull
at all, but maybe somewhere out

748
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,300
here in the field.

749
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,930
And so what you have
instead of this localized,

750
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,380
centralized system is
much more of a paradigm

751
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,600
where the body is
an interaction.

752
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,270
It's not something
that ends here.

753
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,460
It's something
that ends out here.

754
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,150
And that we have an interaction
taking place between us

755
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:21,745
and our environment, us and
the field at every moment.

756
00:39:21,745 --> 00:39:26,035
>> I had an irregularity on
a kidney that was discovered

757
00:39:26,035 --> 00:39:26,835
by an MRI.

758
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,370
The physicians wanted
to operate, biopsy that.

759
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,170
And I said, no.

760
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,320
We're not going to do that.

761
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,260
I had a healer, Adam, a
young man in Vancouver

762
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,370
who was developing his
talents as a healer.

763
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,380
He wanted to work on it.

764
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:54,120
Over a period of a month,
we did that once a week.

765
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,840
>> Using just a photograph, Adam
can perceive a person's body

766
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,140
field in the form of
a holographic image.

767
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,000
He sees areas where the
energy flow is blocked,

768
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,910
which indicates
illness or injury.

769
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,950
Through his
intention to heal, he

770
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,080
manipulates energy
and information

771
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,850
to clear these blockages,
allowing the body to change.

772
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:19,120
>> I went back and had a
sonogram made of that a month

773
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,920
after diagnosis.

774
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,760
The radiologist examined
the data and said,

775
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,100
whatever you're
doing, keep doing it,

776
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,950
that the irregularity
in the kidney is smaller

777
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,780
and disappearing.

778
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:38,440
Went back three months
after that later in 2003

779
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,770
after that, where the
total healing period had

780
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,940
been less than six months,
and again had a sonogram,

781
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,500
and it was totally gone.

782
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,870
Everything was regular again.

783
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:54,180
Nearly all of the healings
that I have worked with

784
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,600
had been remote
or at a distance.

785
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,362
And it didn't seem to make--

786
00:41:00,362 --> 00:41:02,070
the distance, as it
seems, have no effect

787
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,750
at all, which would again
suggest we're dealing

788
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,580
with a quantum phenomena.

789
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,600
The healer was in
Vancouver, British Columbia.

790
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,050
I was in Florida, the longest
distance across the United

791
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,830
States.

792
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,710
I've continued
then to experiment

793
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,990
with different healing
modes for different things

794
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:24,820
with different people, but the
mechanism is always the same.

795
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,770
There's information
being transferred,

796
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,920
and there seems to be an
energy transfer as well that's

797
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,720
palpable.

798
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,490
>> It now appears that
our bodies are connected

799
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,130
to the field, but what
is the mechanism for this

800
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,960
intercommunication?

801
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,630
How can this
connection take place?

802
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,455
One possible solution?

803
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:48,255
The biophoton.

804
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,230
Biophotons are weak
emissions of light

805
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,890
emanating from the cells
of all living things.

806
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,350
>> We know we're sending out
information with biophoton

807
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:05,690
emissions because people like
Fritz Popp have discovered that

808
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,060
we are sending out
tiny currents of light.

809
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,210
>> We started to look
for these photons.

810
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,030
I knew from the beginning
on that it must not

811
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,500
be very high intensity,
but it was clear

812
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:22,760
that one should have these
photons at all in a cell.

813
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,100
>> In order to detect
the biophotons,

814
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,790
Professor Popp and his students
needed a photo multiplier that

815
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,010
was so sensitive it could see
a candle over 12 miles away.

816
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,550
When a living organism is
placed in front of the photon

817
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:42,711
detector, light emitting from
the cells can be observed.

818
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,820
>> We started with
cucumber seedlings,

819
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,490
and later with other ones.

820
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:57,060
And all living systems which
we put into the instrument

821
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,360
showed this very
weak photon emission.

822
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,350
>> Professor Popp theorizes that
these biophoton emissions may

823
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,560
be controlling our
body's metabolism.

824
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,410
>> Molecules cannot
regulate themselves.

825
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,420
They have to have a
field, more or less.

826
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,932
So the photons
should be the carrier

827
00:43:16,932 --> 00:43:20,610
of the information, which
is necessary to regulate

828
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:23,430
the metabolism.

829
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:26,190
>> These biophotons
create a dynamic,

830
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,590
coherent web of light
within our bodies.

831
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,940
Our bodies are
constantly emitting light

832
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,370
in the form of biophotons.

833
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:42,180
Are these biophotons the
body's control mechanism?

834
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,270
Isn't that the function
of our DNA, our genes?

835
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,110
>> Genes are not
controlling our biology.

836
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,900
When we get issues running
in families-- for example,

837
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,790
cancer--

838
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,890
we immediately look
at a genealogy chart

839
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,230
and mark all the recipients
of this cancer running

840
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,570
through the family, and then
turn around and say, look.

841
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:03,410
Genetics.

842
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:06,489
This is running in the family,
so there must be cancer genes.

843
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:08,780
>> What they've left out of
this very interesting piece

844
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,170
of research reveals that
when children are adopted

845
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:16,730
into families that have cancer,
the adopted children will

846
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:20,360
express the cancer with the same
propensity as any natural child

847
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,620
in that family.

848
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,169
But the interesting
fact is the child

849
00:44:23,169 --> 00:44:25,460
comes from totally different
genetics that doesn't even

850
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,720
have that cancer.

851
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,530
So it says, being introduced
into the family dynamics, which

852
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:33,680
is where you learn perceptions
and beliefs and attitudes,

853
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,710
is what shapes the
cancer, not the genetics

854
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,590
that somebody came in with.

855
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:43,220
>> There is a new branch of
genetics known as epigenetics

856
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,530
that addresses this
environmental influence

857
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:48,390
on genetic expression.

858
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:53,090
>> Epigeneticists have
discovered that the information

859
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,900
inside every cell, the thing
that switches it on and turns

860
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:03,380
it on and changes things is not
inside the cell, but outside.

861
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,740
Signals occur outside
from the environment.

862
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,800
>> A gene is a blueprint--
that's basically what it is--

863
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,330
to make a protein molecule.

864
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,860
And the proteins-- there
are over 100,000 of them--

865
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,415
are the building
blocks that give us

866
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,700
our biology, our
structure, our behavior.

867
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,890
So the issue is, we talk
about gene blueprints.

868
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:24,680
And up until the last
10 years, a blueprint

869
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,930
was a hardwired
piece of information

870
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:29,030
to make a particular protein.

871
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,340
The new science is
just mind boggling,

872
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,590
because it reveals that
through epigenetic mechanisms,

873
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,770
through the influence of
the environment on reading

874
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:40,580
the genes, epigenetic
mechanisms can produce over

875
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:45,519
30,000 different variations
from every gene blueprint.

876
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:47,060
And all of the
sudden, when you start

877
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,070
to recognize that,
you realize, we

878
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,620
have potentials that
are totally unlimited.

879
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,200
And this is a great
change from a belief

880
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,510
that genes were deterministic.

881
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,670
Now genes are potentials.

882
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,130
>> If you just look at
the molecular level,

883
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:04,280
the Human Genome Project has
revealed that we have about

884
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,840
25,000 genes, far fewer than
they originally expected.

885
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,210
The Chimpanzee Genome
Project has now

886
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,150
sequenced the entire
chimpanzee genome,

887
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:16,756
and their genome is
virtually the same as ours.

888
00:46:16,756 --> 00:46:18,380
They've got the same
kinds of proteins,

889
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,830
the same kind of genes.

890
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,920
You can hardly tell
the difference.

891
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,690
Yet there's an
obvious difference.

892
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,320
And if you can't explain it in
terms of genes, what can you

893
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,640
explain it in terms of?

894
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,720
And the answer is, I think,
morphogenetic fields.

895
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,050
Just as you can build
two different buildings

896
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:38,180
with the same bricks
and cement, if you

897
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,840
have two different plans, you
can build different organisms

898
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,900
with different fields, even
if the constituent molecules

899
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,610
are very similar, as they are
in humans and chimpanzees.

900
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,950
>> The DNA is like
a library book.

901
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,190
These are all the possible
proteins from earthworms

902
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,020
right up to us.

903
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,810
it's all the same
library, but you've

904
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:04,070
got to know which book to
take out of the library.

905
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,480
This is the big
problem in genetics

906
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,040
itself, is trying to
explain how the body knows

907
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,790
which book to take out
of the genetic library.

908
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,270
And we think the
body field is what

909
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,840
decides which piece
of information

910
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,060
is taken from the DNA.

911
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,970
>> Many cultures of the past
have explored the energetic

912
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:30,830
system of the body.

913
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:33,410
Today researchers
theorize that the body

914
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:37,760
does have a field of energy
known as the morphogenic field,

915
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,560
or the body field.

916
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,650
>> There's a hierarchy of
fields organizing our bodies.

917
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,150
There's the field
of the whole body.

918
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,920
There's the fields of
the organs, and then

919
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,378
the fields of the
tissues, and then

920
00:47:47,378 --> 00:47:49,790
the fields of the
cells within those.

921
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:53,480
Fields of our own body is
within and around the body.

922
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,710
There's an overall field.

923
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,050
And then there's
subsidiary fields,

924
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:02,421
sort of modular fields for arms,
legs, and the different organs.

925
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:06,670
The advantage of fields is that
they're intrinsically holistic.

926
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,470
All fields are holistic.

927
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,000
The gravitational field is.

928
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,310
You can't slice a bit out of it.

929
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:15,160
If you cut a flatworm
into 10 different pieces,

930
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,380
each part can grow
into a new worm.

931
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,510
Now how is that possible?

932
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:23,210
If it was a machine,
that wouldn't happen.

933
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:27,470
If you cut up a machine, all
you get is a broken machine.

934
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:31,610
But if you cut up a magnet,
a field system, then however

935
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,590
many little bits of
magnet you produce,

936
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:36,800
each has a complete
magnetic field.

937
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,280
And it was this analogy
with magnetic fields

938
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,340
that lead developmental
biologists to suggest

939
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,040
the idea of morphogenetic
fields in the first place,

940
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,920
and this was way
back in the 1920s.

941
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,110
And this field is
now a crucial concept

942
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,090
in developmental biology.

943
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:57,320
You can't really understand how
organisms develop without it.

944
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,830
>> All humans begin life
as a single cell that grows

945
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:04,940
and divides, developing into
the various organs and limbs

946
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,340
of our bodies.

947
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,420
How these cells
know what to become

948
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,390
has baffled scientists
and led to the idea

949
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:15,260
of controlled fields in biology.

950
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,130
>> We've already found that
there are different parts

951
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:22,610
of the body field, some of
which relate to the muscles

952
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:23,956
and connective tissue.

953
00:49:23,956 --> 00:49:25,580
There's another part
of the body field

954
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:29,390
that relates to the
brain and nervous system.

955
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,960
Yet another one for the
morphic field, which connects

956
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,150
back to the DNA and the genetic
information of your body.

957
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:40,890
So it links up with
medicine in many places,

958
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,770
so it's not different
from medicine.

959
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:46,790
It's just going a little
bit further conceptually.

960
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,640
>> These energetic fields
may provide the information

961
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,000
necessary for
controlling the body.

962
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,870
>> How does the body know
to maintain its temperature

963
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:59,450
at a particular temperature?

964
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:02,420
What decides or
who decides what is

965
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:07,500
going to be the correct blood
pressure for that person?

966
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,340
Nobody knows.

967
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,060
And we're saying
as a holistic idea,

968
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,410
the body field decides
to turn all the knobs.

969
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:19,560
>> Informational health care
means that if we take the ideas

970
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,190
of epigenetics, we're actually
able to take the information

971
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,830
from your original blueprint
of how your body works when

972
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:29,010
it's working perfectly,
imprint that information back

973
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:30,020
into the body.

974
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,850
And as you do that, the body
starts to correct itself

975
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:36,480
and goes back towards that
original healthy blueprint.

976
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,640
>> Morphogenetic fields,
or more generally,

977
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,960
fields of information, yes, are
control systems over and above

978
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,740
the molecular level or
the biochemical level.

979
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,710
They're systems that
organize the body.

980
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:52,470
They organize the
developing organism.

981
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:54,165
Plants have them too.

982
00:50:54,165 --> 00:50:56,790
All animals have them.

983
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,830
They maintain the
form of the body.

984
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:02,250
They help bodies to recover
from disease or damage.

985
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,990
They underlie
regeneration, for example.

986
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:08,700
And I think that we really need
a field-based model of the body

987
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,530
if we're ever going to
be able to integrate

988
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:12,360
different forms of
healing or medicine

989
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,890
into a coherent understanding.

990
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:19,140
>> The body field is
an energetic field,

991
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:22,020
filled with patterns
of information.

992
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,270
All of the organs in
our bodies generate

993
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:26,790
their own specific fields.

994
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,510
One organ in particular seems
to generate significant fields

995
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:34,130
which affect the entire body.

996
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,300
>> The heart is the
emperor in the system.

997
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,630
The liver and all the
organs have other tasks,

998
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,520
but the heart is overruling all.

999
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,220
>> There's a concept in
energy medicine called energy

1000
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:51,460
cardiology that says that these
signals produced by the heart

1001
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,150
are all of regulatory
importance.

1002
00:51:55,150 --> 00:52:00,050
The heart is constantly emitting
sound, pressure waves, heat,

1003
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:05,230
light, electrical, magnetic,
and electromagnetic signals.

1004
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:09,730
>> All of the cells in the body
are receiving these different

1005
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,820
kinds of signals
at different times,

1006
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:16,120
because they travel at
different velocities through

1007
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,950
the circulatory system.

1008
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,160
>> The heart generates by
far the largest rhythmic

1009
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,682
electromagnetic
signal in the body.

1010
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:29,100
If you look at this magnetic
field as a carrier wave,

1011
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,770
it's being modulated
with information so as

1012
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:34,170
to carry away for information.

1013
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,030
And the work in
our lab has shown

1014
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,620
quite clearly that
it's modulated

1015
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,496
with emotional patterns.

1016
00:52:40,496 --> 00:52:44,830
In other words, if we're feeling
angry or frustrated, irritated,

1017
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:47,650
the information
that's been imprinted

1018
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:50,800
on that magnetic field
is very different

1019
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,500
than if we're feeling
care or love or compassion

1020
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,270
towards that person.

1021
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:58,450
>> The heart has been found to
have rhythmic beating patterns

1022
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,730
that can be incoherent
or coherent.

1023
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,820
These patterns are closely
linked to our emotions

1024
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,590
and how we feel.

1025
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:10,700
>> When the heart's rhythmic
beating pattern is smooth

1026
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,430
and ordered, it's called
a coherent rhythm.

1027
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:18,080
And that coherent rhythm
entrains or synchronizes

1028
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,790
the brain rhythm,
the nervous system.

1029
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:23,210
The bodily organs and
glands all dance in harmony

1030
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:25,700
to that heart coherent rhythm.

1031
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,550
>> Positive emotions, what
we tend to call positive--

1032
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:32,780
things like love, appreciation,
care, forgiveness, gratitude--

1033
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,430
all lead to a very different
kind of heart pattern

1034
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:36,860
than negative things.

1035
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,150
Like if we're feeling anger
or irritation, anxiety,

1036
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:43,010
those create what are
called incoherent rhythms

1037
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,760
or disordered patterns.

1038
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,760
On the other hand, we
have the positive feelings

1039
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,939
when we're just appreciating the
sunset and how beautiful it is.

1040
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:53,480
Our hearts beating out this--
what we call a coherent rhythm.

1041
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,080
It's a sign wave-like
pattern that the heart

1042
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,900
is sending to the brain.

1043
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,480
>> And we call it heart
coherence, because in research,

1044
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,230
we find that the heart has to
get into this synchronized,

1045
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:10,520
coherent, rhythmic pattern
of heart rate in order

1046
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,190
for the rest of the brain and
the nervous system and body

1047
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:17,330
to entrain and synchronize
to that powerful rhythm.

1048
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:19,230
So it starts with the heart.

1049
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:22,010
>> When we feel the pulse, what
we're feeling is the pressure

1050
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,930
wave created by
the beating heart.

1051
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:25,430
It's not actually
the flow of blood.

1052
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,109
It's the pressure wave.

1053
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:29,150
So every time the heart
beats, that pressure wave

1054
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,840
goes to the brain and
throughout the body.

1055
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,860
And if we look at
the brain level,

1056
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,662
that pressure wave
synchronizes all the neurons.

1057
00:54:36,662 --> 00:54:38,120
Like, the brain
would be in trouble

1058
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,170
if it didn't have that
synchronizing signal

1059
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:43,880
to kind of give us a global
synchronizing effect.

1060
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,090
>> When someone is in coherence,
you can often feel their love

1061
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:50,420
or their compassion or
their gratitude radiating.

1062
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,180
>> Coherence is the optimal
physiological state that

1063
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,870
underlies learning and
performance and facilitating

1064
00:54:56,870 --> 00:55:01,190
the body's natural
regenerative processes.

1065
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:04,230
>> The heart has its own
intrinsic nervous system,

1066
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:09,150
which can sense, feel, remember,
and process information

1067
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:12,110
that's independent
from the brain.

1068
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:16,490
>> We always think of the
information input system

1069
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:19,970
as being entirely in the brain.

1070
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:22,130
But we're now
discovering information

1071
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:25,640
that the heart receives
information first, and then

1072
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,360
relays it to the brain.

1073
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,360
>> Studies have shown that
the heart responds faster than

1074
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,480
the brain to
outside stimulation.

1075
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,170
>> One of the more recent
studies we did in our labs was

1076
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:41,136
looking at what we ended up
titling the electrophysiology

1077
00:55:41,136 --> 00:55:42,580
of intuition.

1078
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,670
And there was some previous
research that had been done,

1079
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:48,100
showing that the
body would respond

1080
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,480
in a way that would
predict a future event

1081
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,440
if the future event
was emotionally

1082
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,330
significant and
relevant to the person.

1083
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:59,030
>> Participants were
attached to sensors to record

1084
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:02,090
their brainwave
activity, heart activity,

1085
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:04,560
and heart-brain interactions.

1086
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,607
>> A person would be standing
at a computer, push a button,

1087
00:56:07,607 --> 00:56:09,440
and then we're recording
physiological data.

1088
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,330
And six to eight
seconds later, you

1089
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,400
would be shown a photograph.

1090
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,950
And then the photograph would
be from two opposite ends

1091
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:18,680
of the spectrum of
emotional arousal.

1092
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,260
>> Participants were shown
pictures of car accident

1093
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:26,300
victims, snakes attacking,
and other disturbing images.

1094
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,890
On the other end
of the spectrum,

1095
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:31,460
the pictures included
flowers or sunsets.

1096
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:34,040
The photographs were
randomly assigned for display

1097
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,200
to the participants.

1098
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:40,490
>> What's key here is the
computer assigned not only

1099
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:43,940
which photograph, but which type
of photograph after the data

1100
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,210
was already recorded.

1101
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:48,785
So it was absolutely impossible
for the research subject,

1102
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:51,499
the experimenter to have
any kind of fore knowledge

1103
00:56:51,499 --> 00:56:52,790
of what photograph it might be.

1104
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:55,310
The computer itself
didn't even know.

1105
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:57,960
>> The results were surprising.

1106
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,090
The body responded even before
the picture was displayed.

1107
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:05,900
>> What we found was that
not only did the body indeed

1108
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,760
respond prior to the event--

1109
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,040
you know, seeing the picture in
a way that would predict it--

1110
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,950
but it was the heart
that responded first.

1111
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:19,500
>> The heart's response
was not only faster,

1112
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,650
but the signal it is sent to
the brain varied depending

1113
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:25,690
on the emotional
content of the picture.

1114
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,200
>> Looking at the signals
that the heart was sending

1115
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,210
to the brain, that the heart
literally sent a different

1116
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:34,630
message to the brain depending
on what the future picture was

1117
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:39,420
going to be, then you saw a
brain response and you saw

1118
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:43,710
the body response, which is
where it then became conscious.

1119
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,580
So the flow of this
intuitive information

1120
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,874
is heart, brain, body.

1121
00:57:48,874 --> 00:57:50,790
Then you have to have
the body response for it

1122
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:53,160
to become consciously
aware of it.

1123
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,190
>> What these experiments
reveal is changing our basic

1124
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:59,880
understanding of how the
human body functions.

1125
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,450
>> It appears as though
the heart, and brain later,

1126
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:06,715
have access to a field of
information not bound by time

1127
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:07,515
and space.

1128
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,880
If we're talking kind of
quantum holographics or quantum

1129
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,490
physics, that's old news.

1130
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,260
We're really starting
to have ways now

1131
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,200
of showing that
we really do have

1132
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,020
an energetic or an
electronic system,

1133
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:26,090
and that that's really primary.

1134
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:30,220
It's really not bound
by time and space.

1135
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,710
>> The heart is connected
to a field of information

1136
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,980
and intelligence that's
different but complementary

1137
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,934
to the field of the brain.

1138
00:58:37,934 --> 00:58:39,850
>> It's very clear, these
neurons in the heart

1139
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:43,880
and the brain part have
short and long-term memory.

1140
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,540
They process information.

1141
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,740
It's a functional brain.

1142
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,560
>> Other researchers theorize
that the heart may be

1143
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:54,300
the master organ for imprinting
information into the body

1144
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,620
field.

1145
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:58,740
>> There's a lot of neural
tissue in the heart,

1146
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,890
and we believe that neural
tissue is there in order to act

1147
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:05,130
as an imprinter
for the hologram.

1148
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:08,400
>> The body's holographic body
field is continually supplied

1149
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,060
with information via the
pressure waves of the heart.

1150
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:15,240
>> Inside the heart, there is
an enormous amount of charge.

1151
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,460
Now the pressure
waves in the presence

1152
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:20,880
of this charge inside
the chamber of the heart

1153
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,480
is sufficient to
imprint information.

1154
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,510
>> If the heart is transmitting
or imprinting information,

1155
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:30,360
there must be a way for the
cells in the body to receive

1156
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,640
that information.

1157
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,820
>> There are receptor
protein cells on the outside

1158
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:40,140
of the cell, which is simply
there to receive environmental

1159
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,250
information.

1160
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,570
How is my day today?

1161
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,220
What is going on out there?

1162
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,590
What does the body want this
little cell to do today?

1163
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:48,870
You see what I mean?

1164
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:52,680
There has to be
intercellular communication,

1165
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:57,090
but there has to be one source
so there can be one control

1166
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:58,690
system for the body.

1167
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,890
>> This control system is
sending out information

1168
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:12,820
to the body via the body
field, but what exactly is

1169
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,210
information?

1170
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:19,300
>> We think of the body as both
a material and an energetic,

1171
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,680
dynamically exchanging
open system, which it is.

1172
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,990
We need to eat, like, a ton
of food a year, and most of it

1173
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:26,980
is passed out.

1174
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,520
So all of that food
is somehow turned

1175
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,590
into the body, which
remains extremely

1176
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,420
stable for long periods of time.

1177
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,860
Somebody basically
doesn't change

1178
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:38,650
much for maybe 40
years as an adult.

1179
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:41,050
People recognize you
immediately even 40 years later,

1180
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,210
because the basic body
structure doesn't change,

1181
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:45,950
even though after a
short period of time,

1182
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,730
you don't have a single
atom left in your body.

1183
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:51,190
They've all exchanged,
and gone out.

1184
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:54,564
And so now this is the hamburger
I ate yesterday, and three

1185
01:00:54,564 --> 01:00:56,980
weeks from now, this will be
a carrot that I eat tomorrow,

1186
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:57,820
and so on.

1187
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,580
It's a very dynamic system,
and yet I remain the same.

1188
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:03,550
So if it's not the
material, and presumably not

1189
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,950
the energetic part, the
dynamic, energetic part, then

1190
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,300
what's left?

1191
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,820
There must be something like
an informational pattern which

1192
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,110
holds it together.

1193
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:15,700
>> Many scientists who are on
the frontier theorize and have

1194
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:19,420
demonstrated that we're
an information system,

1195
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,330
and it's not entirely
localized in our body.

1196
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:26,140
That we're accessing information
from the field all the time.

1197
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,870
>> The body appears to be
constantly connecting with

1198
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:33,130
information within itself and
with information in the field.

1199
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:36,490
The body is always looking
for coherent systems,

1200
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:39,880
looking for information
interchange between all cells

1201
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,580
it has, so that every
single cell knows what's on.

1202
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,820
That's a large
information system,

1203
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,550
and some people say
that illness is just

1204
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,960
a lack in the
information system.

1205
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,650
And I suppose they are right.

1206
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:56,380
>> Matter is compressed energy.

1207
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,510
Information is
patterns of energy.

1208
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,780
There's an information
flow in our bodies

1209
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:04,810
that we still don't
completely understand

1210
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:07,660
through our nervous system
and through the tissues.

1211
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:10,390
And even some of The
Ancients, the Chinese

1212
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,160
called it the
acupuncture system, which

1213
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,940
is a system of information
flow in the body itself.

1214
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:20,320
>> We get a system
when we get structure.

1215
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:24,480
You know, there's information
everywhere, isn't there?

1216
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,570
You only get that information
system when it's ordered.

1217
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:33,910
And the great thing that
was discovered in the 1980s

1218
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:36,220
was that the acupuncture
system appears

1219
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:38,870
to be an organized system.

1220
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:43,170
It's not just a random group
of acupuncture meridians.

1221
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:47,530
It looked upon doing
experiments that they wanted

1222
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:50,230
to arrange themselves
in a certain order,

1223
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,970
and that they wanted
to communicate

1224
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:55,940
with each other in
a certain direction.

1225
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,180
So we're saying that
information has order,

1226
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:01,776
and that's what makes the body
field is the order itself.

1227
01:03:01,776 --> 01:03:04,150
>> The implications of looking
at the physics of the body

1228
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:06,910
and combining that with
technology is that more

1229
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,450
and more people are going
to be able to take control

1230
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,825
of their own health
care journey.

1231
01:03:10,825 --> 01:03:13,300
Now if you look at
the past 100 years,

1232
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,220
the control of people's
health has actually

1233
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,230
been in the doctors
and practitioners

1234
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:19,890
and directed what
biochemistry or pharmaceutical

1235
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:21,040
they should take.

1236
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,070
But now as you're
able to work out

1237
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:25,210
what's going on in your
body and trigger a healing

1238
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:28,930
response in the size of
something of your mobile phone,

1239
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,189
the power is directly being
shifted to the individual.

1240
01:03:32,189 --> 01:03:34,480
Now really, the role of the
doctor and the practitioner

1241
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,970
in the future is to
empower the individual

1242
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,800
to take control of
their own health

1243
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,380
and help them on their
own healing journey.

1244
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:43,540
>> Ultimately,
according to Einstein,

1245
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:46,480
and other people more recently
have said that energean

1246
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,570
information must
be interchangeable.

1247
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:51,860
All right?

1248
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,580
So information becomes
a type of energy,

1249
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:59,110
because it's an
orderliness in space.

1250
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,520
So they are interchangeable.

1251
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,710
But on the other
hand, in practice

1252
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:05,980
what happens is you
get a wave of energy,

1253
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:10,900
and then upon that wave, you
can get imprinted information.

1254
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,150
And the amount of
information you can imprint

1255
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:15,430
appears to be limitless.

1256
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:18,970
Informational
medicine, medicine that

1257
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:23,560
takes information and changes
disturbed information,

1258
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,520
is going to be the
future of medicine.

1259
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,820
>> Apparently, the control
system of the body is not genes

1260
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:34,900
or chemistry, but information,
which seems to be available

1261
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,760
in the body field.

1262
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,700
Is it possible to put new
information into the body

1263
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,950
to affect wellness?

1264
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:46,431
That is exactly what a number
of researchers are doing.

1265
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:50,580
>> Now we've learned how to stop
the distortion of information

1266
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:55,200
that occurs as a result of
various disease processes.

1267
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,100
Once you stop the distortion,
surprisingly enough,

1268
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,600
the physiology begins to work.

1269
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,310
The chemistry comes right.

1270
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:05,160
There are really
wonderful healing stories

1271
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,960
to be told here.

1272
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,910
And it's simply
because we've learned

1273
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:14,520
how to correct the distortion of
information in your body field.

1274
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,870
>> Disease is, in a sense,
scrambled information.

1275
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:23,190
And so if we can access the
appropriate information,

1276
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:25,530
we correct the scrambling.

1277
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:29,250
And that's what a number of
these new energy modalities

1278
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,150
are doing.

1279
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:33,774
They're basically correcting
that information scrambling.

1280
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:41,710
>> I was diagnosed with
thyroid cancer when I was 20,

1281
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,630
which resulted in
having to have surgery,

1282
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:47,280
and they removed all but a
fourth of my thyroid gland.

1283
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,450
I've had to take a
synthetic hormone

1284
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:53,290
to give me the thyroid hormone
that I needed ever since.

1285
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:57,430
I was diagnosed with
chronic fatigue syndrome

1286
01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:02,270
some years later, and
fibromyalgia some years later.

1287
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:04,600
Which, I just continued
to get sicker and sicker.

1288
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:13,270
My husband had to pick me up out
of the bed if I had to get up.

1289
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:17,220
He had to feed me, set me
up in the bed and feed me.

1290
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:21,630
>> It got really bad, to the
point of where pretty much I

1291
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:24,280
bathed her and carried her
from the bed to the bathroom,

1292
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,960
and things of this nature just
for her to survive on a daily

1293
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,330
basis.

1294
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:35,721
>> They really didn't know what
to do for that type of illness.

1295
01:06:35,721 --> 01:06:37,720
I was pretty much told
that you just kind of had

1296
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,610
to live with it.

1297
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:41,800
>> I couldn't help
her, you know?

1298
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,730
And no matter what she told
me, what hurt or what felt bad

1299
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:48,670
or what was happening,
I couldn't help her.

1300
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:51,850
And neither could anybody
else, we didn't think.

1301
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:54,220
>> My doctor finally
said, Vanessa, you know,

1302
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,890
I really don't know what to
do for you at this point.

1303
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:59,170
All I can do is try
to give you medicines

1304
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:01,580
to make you more comfortable.

1305
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:08,950
But I would suggest that you
go see this nutritionist,

1306
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:11,890
and maybe she could help you
figure out what you can eat,

1307
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:16,040
or at least you can start to get
some nutrients from something.

1308
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:21,520
>> Vanessa actually was referred
to me by her endocrinologist.

1309
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,000
When she first came to
me, she was literally not

1310
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,740
able to spend a day
at all out of the bed.

1311
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:33,550
She had lost a tremendous
amount of weight.

1312
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:37,510
She was allergic to
almost everything.

1313
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:42,310
>> I was having a lot of trouble
finding any foods that I could

1314
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:47,610
eat at all, which really
resulted in me being so weak.

1315
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:51,820
>> The inside of her mouth had
a lot of sores inside of it.

1316
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:55,850
The lips had multiple
sores on them

1317
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:58,120
like a cold sore-type thing.

1318
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,990
And her hair was like
straw and coming out.

1319
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:04,870
The first thing I did
was the nest testing.

1320
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:07,960
>> The system is designed to
determine areas of distortion

1321
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,550
in the body field.

1322
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:11,920
New information is made
available to the body

1323
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,440
by ingesting drops that
have been imprinted

1324
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,960
with an information pattern.

1325
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,540
>> I started her out at the
dosing that we would have

1326
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:24,430
addressed a child because her
energy fields were that weak.

1327
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:28,540
So we started out
very, very cautiously.

1328
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:33,490
>> One morning, I woke up
after I had been seeing Deborah

1329
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:36,350
probably for a couple of months.

1330
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:40,689
And I just had this feeling
that I hadn't ever had.

1331
01:08:40,689 --> 01:08:42,140
And I knew--

1332
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:48,000
I knew that this was the answer.

1333
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,446
And I felt so good
that I just cried.

1334
01:08:52,446 --> 01:08:54,029
I just sat up in the
middle of my bed,

1335
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:57,080
and I just cried,
and cried, and cried.

1336
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:01,649
>> In about six months,
she reached an energy level

1337
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:06,420
of where the body was beginning
to transfer a message more

1338
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:10,050
effectively to where every
layer that we went through,

1339
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:16,010
she was showing
remarkable health changes.

1340
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:20,790
>> Being from a man's standpoint
and a southern country boy-type

1341
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:24,810
person is how I grew up, I first
thought it was hocus pocus,

1342
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:26,760
you know?

1343
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,740
And I had my doubts,
and it took a while.

1344
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:35,130
But I see now that
it's phenomenal.

1345
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:36,180
It truly is.

1346
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:39,540
>> I've become healthy enough to
what I think is living a normal

1347
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:42,029
life again.

1348
01:09:42,029 --> 01:09:44,970
Because now, I can
clean my own house.

1349
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:46,270
I can cook my meals.

1350
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:48,090
I can even work in the yard.

1351
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:51,250
I can even wash my car.

1352
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:53,620
I can do things that I
never thought I would ever

1353
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,360
be able to do again.

1354
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,670
>> It's 180 degrees
from where it was.

1355
01:09:57,670 --> 01:09:59,620
Just a total turnaround.

1356
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:00,850
It really is.

1357
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:03,520
>> I really don't know how
to explain the difference

1358
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,426
in the way I feel.

1359
01:10:05,426 --> 01:10:09,190
It's like I died, and
I've come back to life.

1360
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:13,600
And I never thought that I
would ever feel this way again.

1361
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,040
I got my life back.

1362
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:19,240
I got my life back,
and it's wonderful.

1363
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:28,710
>> We're on the threshold of an
entire new understanding of how

1364
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:32,940
disease happens, how
information is transferred,

1365
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:37,970
and how to enhance information
transfer within living systems.

1366
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:40,680
There's a vast increase
in chronic disease

1367
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:45,810
in our community, and I believe
using these information methods

1368
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,850
that we can treat the
chronic disease that

1369
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:50,287
couldn't be treated before.

1370
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:51,870
>> Magnetic fields,
and more recently,

1371
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:55,230
pulsed electromagnetic fields
are being used extensively

1372
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:56,180
in medicine.

1373
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,860
But where it gets
really interesting

1374
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,600
is where you put information
in onto the signal

1375
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,600
of a pulsed
electromagnetic field.

1376
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,010
And that, we've been
witnessing within our research,

1377
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:08,280
has been having incredible
effects on people's healing

1378
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,330
responses.

1379
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:13,620
>> One of the most remarkable
instances of the effectiveness

1380
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:18,900
and the instantaneous effect
of informational medicine,

1381
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,610
I heard about recently.

1382
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,130
And it had to do with a
system called thought field

1383
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:28,670
therapy, which is an energy
psychology that supposedly

1384
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:33,200
heals and changes negative
thoughts around us.

1385
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,380
And the theory is that negative
thoughts hang around us almost

1386
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:40,340
like a net, and they
affect bodily systems.

1387
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:43,790
They use this system in
Kosovo with survivors

1388
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:46,970
of the war in former Yugoslavia.

1389
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:49,280
These were families
who'd had been severely

1390
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,760
traumatized because the
policies of ethnic cleansing

1391
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,910
were to kill half of a family
just so the survivors would

1392
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:57,960
be demoralized.

1393
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,900
So they took a
group of people who

1394
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:03,440
had severe post-traumatic
stress syndrome, who

1395
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,290
would have required years and
years and years of talking

1396
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:10,790
cures and medicine, and all that
sort of conventional thinking,

1397
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:13,790
and they gave them
thought field therapy.

1398
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:15,330
And to a person--

1399
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:19,310
this is 100% of the
people in this study--

1400
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:22,550
were made virtually
instantly better,

1401
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:24,560
to the point where they
were laughing, joking.

1402
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,870
They were healed completely
from this trauma.

1403
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:32,960
Even the practitioners
of energy psychology

1404
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,200
were blown away by the
power of this modality.

1405
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,050
But this just gives
us one small example

1406
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:42,646
of the power of using
information as medicine.

1407
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:50,040
>> So the most important thing
for people to do is to take

1408
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,920
total responsibility
for their health.

1409
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,220
Not to think that it comes
from outside themself

1410
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:59,460
or that somebody else
can give it to them.

1411
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,290
And by taking total
responsibility,

1412
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:05,790
that may mean they have
to start with choosing

1413
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:08,220
the thoughts that they
think so that they are

1414
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:11,400
in a good state of mind,
the state of mind that's

1415
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,990
most conducive to healing.

1416
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:16,020
>> One of the fundamental
things that has to change

1417
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:21,660
in the future of medicine is
this focus on the gene as being

1418
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:24,810
the solution to every illness.

1419
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:27,510
If you look at what
epigeneticists are coming up

1420
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:30,270
with, you have an
understanding that the gene

1421
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:36,300
is really subordinate to this
outside information system.

1422
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,910
And that we have to look
at information rather

1423
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:42,510
than the gene as being the
thing that we have to crack,

1424
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:43,440
so to speak.

1425
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,630
We have to come up with
information systems that

1426
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,510
regularize the
things that go wrong.

1427
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:51,480
>> I think there is absolutely
no question that health care

1428
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,000
today, at a global
level, is in crisis.

1429
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,650
And it's a crisis of meaning.

1430
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:57,570
It's a crisis of economics.

1431
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:59,970
It's a crisis of leadership.

1432
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:03,630
And it's a crisis of our
models and our understanding

1433
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:06,600
of what promotes or
facilitates healing.

1434
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,290
>> We do things like we
have a war on cancer.

1435
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:14,620
We try to destroy
invading organisms.

1436
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:19,410
It's a warfare model
of health and disease

1437
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:22,350
and how to treat disease.

1438
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:26,130
And the body really
doesn't go for that.

1439
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,120
>> We have to learn
from other cultures,

1440
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,530
from other traditions, from
the observations of all

1441
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,230
the different kinds of healers
that are working in our own

1442
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:36,540
cultures at the moment.

1443
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:39,000
We have to take the
best of modern science

1444
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,030
and use it to integrate
what's going on.

1445
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:46,200
>> What we need to do is
foster a revolution that shifts

1446
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:49,590
our model from a
disease-centered orientation

1447
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:52,020
to a healing-centered
orientation.

1448
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,210
And once you begin
to make that move,

1449
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:58,830
you are responsive to a
variety of different factors

1450
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:02,670
that can facilitate or enhance
our natural healing capacities.

1451
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:06,010
>> I think we can rightly
say the revolution has begun,

1452
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:08,310
not just in my case.

1453
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:10,650
There are research workers
all around the world

1454
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:13,200
who are thinking much
the same, and who

1455
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:16,200
have research data
that we can incorporate

1456
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,780
into these new ideas
of the body field.

1457
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,990
But I think now we have a
viable scientific theory

1458
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:25,080
for how the body stores
and accesses information.

1459
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:28,202
So we do have a medical
revolution on our hands.

1460
01:15:28,202 --> 01:15:33,535
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1461
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:29,980
>> There seems to be this huge
body of evidence demonstrating

1462
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:33,010
that we can pick up information.

1463
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:38,220
That almost like an electron,
we can be everywhere at once.

1464
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:42,510
>> So I would say, what healing
is is learning to correct

1465
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:47,080
the human body field so that it
works according to the original

1466
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:47,880
blueprint.

1467
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:53,350
>> As the universe is
holographic in nature,

1468
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:56,460
that means that we're all able
to access the information that

1469
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:59,490
we all need to be able
to operate healthfully.

1470
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:08,090
>> So ultimately, what I'd like
to see is a shift from this

1471
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,700
disease-centered to this
healing-centered model,

1472
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:14,150
and recognizing that healing
is a profound mystery,

1473
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:16,160
and that we have
so much to learn.

1474
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,740
And rather than presuming
we have the answers,

1475
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,630
staying open to the
possibility that there

1476
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:22,610
are new things that we
can discover for how

1477
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:24,190
to enhance the human condition.

1478
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:34,595
>> The mind is the functioning
of the brain that interprets

1479
01:17:34,595 --> 01:17:37,800
the environment and
adjusts the biology.

1480
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,320
So rather than being
controlled by our genes,

1481
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,277
our biology's
controlled by our mind.

1482
01:17:42,277 --> 01:17:43,860
And when you understand
this, then you

1483
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:47,470
realize the power of being
able to change your mind.

1484
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:49,174
Because when you
do that, you change

1485
01:17:49,174 --> 01:17:50,465
your biology and your genetics.

1486
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:55,820
>> If someone's sick, they don't
want to know whether pill X

1487
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:59,080
works better than a placebo
in a double-blind trial.

1488
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,800
What they want to
know is, what's

1489
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,290
the best kind of treatment?

1490
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:19,600
>> I believe that we are more
powerful than we realize.

1491
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,560
I believe that many of
the medical techniques

1492
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,800
that we're finding to
be very successful,

1493
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,660
people can do on themselves
once they understand

1494
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:34,750
their own energetics.

1495
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:38,160
>> It's very clear that negative
information is deleterious,

1496
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:42,520
or if you accept it into your
body and into your body system,

1497
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,067
it will change the way you
react and change your state

1498
01:18:45,067 --> 01:18:45,867
of health.

1499
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:00,880
>> We know that from work by
William Tiller and others,

1500
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,110
we found that when you begin to
work with reconnective healing,

1501
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:06,880
there's an amount of,
I believe he calls it,

1502
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,800
excess free thermodynamic
energy that is released.

1503
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,970
That if this were
just energy or just

1504
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:16,750
energy healing instead of the
reconnection, for this amount

1505
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:19,650
to be released and this
change to happen in people,

1506
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:22,990
it would require that the
room temperature rises

1507
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:26,380
over 300 degrees centigrade.

1508
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:28,350
Which, of course,
does not happen,

1509
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:30,210
because we're
accessing something new

1510
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:31,410
and something different.

1511
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:56,160
>> And coherence is the natural
resonant state of the human

1512
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,550
body, which we do
have, us humans.

1513
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:03,160
We have a resonant
frequency, OK?

1514
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,388
And that's also what we
call the coherent state.

1515
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:36,920
>> So a miracle starts
with a change of thinking.

1516
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:41,350
It's like, when I changed
my thinking about my tumor,

1517
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:44,710
and I decided it was my
best friend and my guide,

1518
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:47,170
rather than it being the worst
thing that had ever happened

1519
01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:50,300
to me, that was the miracle.

1520
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,020
When I gave it permission who
stay to the end of my days,

1521
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:55,010
that was the miracle.

1522
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:56,960
People think it's
the end result,

1523
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,480
but it's not the
end result. It's

1524
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,120
the change of thinking,
which leads to a completely

1525
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,450
different inner state.

1526
01:21:25,654 --> 01:21:26,540
>> You need both.

1527
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:31,240
You need the will to be healed
and the good information

1528
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,940
from a therapist from
infoceuticals, whatever.

1529
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:34,740
Yes, of course.

1530
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:35,944
This has to come together.

1531
01:21:35,944 --> 01:21:36,832
