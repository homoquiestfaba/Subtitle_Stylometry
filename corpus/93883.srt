1
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,612
<i>I, Reuben, take you, Lisa</i>...

2
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:56,019
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa,

3
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,250
to be my lawfully wedded wife.

4
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,758
I do. I do.

5
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,955
Hey, Lois.
The room looks beautiful.

6
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,159
Oh, thanks. And all the candles
have been replaced...

7
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,759
with these mini-lamps you asked for,
so now no more fire hazard.
Great.

8
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,567
<i>Hey, did we sanitize these things?</i>
Reuben!

9
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,167
- The best man is in the house! Ohh!
- Oh!

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,177
- <i>Oh, my God.!</i>
- Sandy, you okay?

11
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,406
Jorgè, ice.
The best man went down.

12
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,848
Dance floor's like a Slip 'N Slide, dude.
I thought I told them not to wax this.

13
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,852
Twenty-three percent of the guests
are over 70.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,048
I don't want anyone breaking a hip.
Okay. Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of it.

15
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,921
All right. I analyze risk for a living.
It's my job to worry.

16
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,290
Okay, let me do the worrying
'cause you gotta get married.
Right.

17
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,852
I'm good.

18
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,957
You got my note that
Harry Bard at table seven
is violently allergic to seafood?

19
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,468
Yes. His chicken will go
nowhere near the fish.

20
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,937
We're putting the finishing touches
on the cake.
This looks great. Lisa's gonna love it.

21
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,030
Hit me, dude.

22
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,707
Hey, aren't you that kid
from <i>Crocodile Tears?</i>

23
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,685
That's right. I'm Sandy Lyle.

24
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,721
Man, I saw that movie in high school.

25
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,019
That bagpipe scene,
that was the funniest shit, man.

26
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,218
We had a good time on that picture.
You want an autograph?

27
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,454
Ah, no, thanks.
It's good to see you, man.

28
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,555
I thought you died,
like, 15 years ago.

29
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,696
Ah. Nah.
I'm very much alive, my friend.

30
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,863
I've been doing a lot of stage acting.
Getting back to my roots.

31
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,873
- Sandy, we should get going 'cause...
- They're making an
<i>E.! True Hollywood Story</i> on me,

32
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,841
so that should clear up
a lot of your questions.

33
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,844
So they're really doing
one of those shows about your life?

34
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,210
Yeah. I got a camera crew
following me around
the next few weeks.

35
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,579
It's gonna be huge.
Wow. That's cool.

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,380
Reuben. Two-minute warning.
Lisa's on her way down.
Okay, thanks.

37
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,445
Look, Reuben.
Yeah.

38
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,650
Now, I'm asking you this because
you're my oldest friend in the world.

39
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,659
Uh-huh.
And I'm your wingman.

40
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,093
Okay. What?

41
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,496
Are you sure you wanna do this?

42
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:51,731
Sandy, there's not a doubt
in my mind.

43
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:55,205
Okay? I found the perfect woman.

44
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,470
We're totally in love.

45
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,842
My life's working out
just like I planned.

46
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,576
Let's go get married.
Okay.

47
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,175
- <i>[Glass Breaks]</i>
- <i>Mazel tov.!</i>

48
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,482
Go on. Kiss each other.

49
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,121
Big smile, everyone!
Come on. You love each other.

50
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,461
<i>Smile, Grandma.</i>

51
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,124
Having fun.

52
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,136
- <i>["Hava Nagila"]</i>
- [Yelling]

53
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,297
Whoa!
[Screams]

54
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,306
[Cloth Rips]
Ohh!

55
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,310
Hello, everybody.
I'm Stan Indursky, Reuben's boss.

56
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,743
<i>Thank you. You're very kind.</i>

57
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,805
Now, Reub's not the sort of fellow
to brag about his own success,

58
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,817
so I'm going to do it for him.

59
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,251
<i>The fact is, this young man here...</i>

60
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,983
is the best risk assessment expert...

61
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,083
<i>in this whole</i> meshugas
<i>we call the insurance business.</i>

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,323
<i>Irving, Vivian,</i>
<i>you've raised a wonderful son.</i>

63
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,296
<i>Let's hear it for him.</i>

64
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:56,563
Reuben, Lisa, let me just say...

65
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:01,005
that I would insure your marriage
any day of the week.

66
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,008
<i>Mazel,</i> you two. Good things.

67
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,408
<i>[Woman]</i>
Mazel Tov!

68
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:09,312
Oh, and, Lisa, don't tire him out
too bad on the honeymoon.

69
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:13,284
- <i>I need this kid fresh when he gets back.</i>
- [Laughing]

70
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,720
- <i>Mazel, mazel.!</i> Good things.
- You know what, the truth is,

71
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,917
I've been waiting for this day
my entire life.

72
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,793
And about four and a half years ago,
I met a real estate agent named
Lisa Kramer,

73
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,525
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Lisa.!</i>
who showed me an apartment,

74
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,760
which I rented
just so she'd go out with me.

75
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,030
I gave him a good price.
Yeah, not good enough.

76
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,800
She's a killer. No, seriously, um...

77
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:37,274
After about a month of dating,
I knew she was the one.

78
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:41,279
<i>[Woman] Aw.</i>
And I couldn't be happier...

79
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,646
that on this day that I've been
dreaming about for so long,

80
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:49,086
the woman I'm standing
next to... is you.

81
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,374
<i>[Lisa Laughing]</i>
<i>Oh, my goodness.!</i>

82
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,782
I lost my shoe!
Look at this place!

83
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,945
Oh, it's so pretty!
It's beautiful.

84
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,489
What?
[Screams]

85
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,763
How's your bruise?
It's okay.

86
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,531
You know, it's a little sore.

87
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:42,506
<i>You know, they really should tell you</i>
<i>if they'rejust gonna let komodo dragons</i>
<i>run loose around the hotel.</i>

88
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,509
Really.

89
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,580
Oh! How about this one?

90
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,916
Let's see. "Recently renovated colonial
in Montclair, three-bedroom."

91
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,956
Sweetie, remember?
We took a virtual tour of this one
on the Internet.

92
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,219
It was perfect,
but just a little pricey.

93
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,160
Oh, right, right. That's right.

94
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,163
It's probably off the market anyway.

95
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,165
Why do you say that?

96
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,861
'Cause I bought it.

97
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,961
You what?

98
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,404
I bought it!

99
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,907
Uh...
[Both Laughing]

100
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:22,073
Reuben, I'm in shock.
I mean, you just... you don't...
you don't do things like that.

101
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,207
You love it, right?
Yes, I do, but, Reuby...

102
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,444
We have a house!
Oh, my God,
we have a house!

103
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,487
Honey!

104
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,282
- Hi. Hello.
- [Laughs]
Oh!

105
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,791
- [French Accent]
How's it going?
- [Chuckles]

106
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,920
Uh, it's, uh, going great.
Thank you.

107
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:41,729
So I see you gang are new to the island.
I want to come have a meet with you,
show you my boat.

108
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,133
<i>That is my boat there</i>
<i>on the sandbar.</i>

109
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:48,640
- It's very, uh, big.
- Yeah, it's pretty good size.
It's good size.

110
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,405
So, tell me true,
are you guys for scuba?

111
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,412
What does that mean?

112
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,142
<i>I'm like the unofficial</i>
<i>scuba king of St. Barts,</i>

113
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,582
so if you are for scuba,
I take you out on the boat,

114
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,620
<i>I show you the coral reef,</i>

115
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,087
and we have kinda like a...
like a scuba party.

116
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,649
That sounds great,
but we're not certified,
so we're gonna have to pass.

117
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,026
That is no biggie.
I get you resort-certified
couple of hour.

118
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,794
- Oh, I have always wanted to try it.
- Yeah?

119
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,097
Good. My name is Claude.
What is, uh, you guys' name?

120
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,138
Uh, my name is Reuben.

121
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,470
This is my wife, Lisa.

Hello.

Isn't this exciting?
It is. It's fun.

129
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,893
You know what? I think I'm gonna
skip the scuba diving.

130
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,495
Reuben, no. You called eight hotels.
They all said that this guy was the best.

131
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,632
I know, but you know
how I am about boats,
and I'm feeling a little queasy.

132
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,642
Oh, no.
Your stomach's acting funny?

133
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,146
It's okay now, but I think it might...
You know how it gets, you know?
So why don't you go?

134
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,205
We're on our honeymoon.
I'm not gonna go without you.

135
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,479
No! You've been wanting to try this.
I want you to go, okay?

136
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,646
No.
It'll be fun. I'll pick you up
like at 4:00, all right?

137
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,350

You're not for scuba, Leuban?
<i>No, Claude.</i>

- I'm gonna go run some errands in town.
- [Scoffs]

141
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,567
But you guys go. You have fun.
Can I talk to you for a second though?

142
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,540
- Of course.
- [No Audible Dialogue]

Hey, listen, this woman means more
to me than anything else in the world,

00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,840
so be careful 'cause scuba can be
very dangerous if the proper
precautions aren't taken.

145
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,149
Leuban, look to me in my eyeball.

318
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,196
And now you live here in New York?
Yeah, moved here
a few months ago.

319

Wow.

You've got to be married with kids...

325
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,622
No, I'm not. I'm single.
Yeah, I haven't taken the plunge.

- Oh.
- Can I talk to you for a sec?

327
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:37,961
Yeah. Hey, Sandy, this is Polly Prince.
Remember? From middle school?
Hey, how you doing?

328
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,403
Wow. Okay. Sandy Lyle.

329

Yeah. Sorry.
Excuse us.

00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:57,185
What happened to you?
Reuben, I'm in a situation here.
We have to leave now.

334
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,315
No. Can we stay
a couple more minutes?
Dude, no.

335
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,360
This is serious.
I just sharted.

336
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,952
I don't know what that means.
I tried to fart
and a little shit came out.

337
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,828
I just sharted. Now let's go.

338
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,764
You're the most disgusting person
I've ever met in my life.

339

You have to walk around

Mm-hmm.

340

Polly?
Focus for one second, okay?
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,046
So, hey, guy.
I got to go circulate.

You're still acting?

343

I am. Yeah. It's going incredibly well.

344
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,018

Yeah, you too.

Okay. See ya.
All right. Bye, Polly.

348

- Be good.
- Bye. More wine?

349
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,904
Polly Prince.

350
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,202
It's funny, huh? Seeing her.

351
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:53,005
Are you okay?
<i>Great. Thank you.</i>

352
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,569
Huh. She looks good.

Let it rain!

354
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:03,343
So I did a lot of thinking last night,
and there's something
I'm pretty excited about.

355
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,788
What's up? Nice.

356
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:10,487
Let it rain!
I feel like I might be ready to move on.

357
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,655
You know, get my life back on track.

358
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:16,098
So, I am going to ask
Polly Prince on a date.

359
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,501
Oh, that's a mistake!
She's not right for you, dude.

Actually, we're kind of
in the middle of a conversation, so...
You douche bags bring your "A" game?

363
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,381

You don't even know
this girl, Reuben.

You haven't seen her
since seventh grade.

378
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,716
How different could she be?
I mean, she was a senior delegate
at the Model U.N.

379
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,317
She was in the chess club.
She was a "mathlete."

380
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,296
Her yearbook stats are really impressive.
Did you see the tattoo on her back?

381
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,161
Yeah. So what?

382
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,396
Mathletes don't wear body art
like that. 'Nuff said. Ball in!

383
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:28,200
I really feel like
I ran into Polly for a reason.

384
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,798
Really. I mean, I'm sorry
if you don't agree, Sandy,

385
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,401
but I happen to believe
in a little thing called destiny.

386
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,649
You guys ready?

387
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,616

you could put your shirt back on?

Could we switch?

how to cover this man right here, okay?

deadly bacteria from about

is look at the snack bowl

1101
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,261
on your Riskmaster thingy and...
Okay, you know what?

1102
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:43,526
I can explain this, Polly.
Well, no, it's fascinating.
I learned a lot about myself.

1103
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:47,365
I've learned that I have no career,
I'm flaky, I like ethnic food.

1104
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,370
Polly, would you let me explain this?
Uh-huh.

1105
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:52,771
Lisa came back, and I, you know,
I've been trying to figure things out.

1106
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:57,245
What are you figuring out, Reuben?
Just about us and our future.

1107
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,110
Future?
What are you talking about?

1108
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,115
What future?
Reuben, come on!

1109
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:05,279
This is a fling, you know?
Come on. What, did you think
we were gonna get married?

1110
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:08,152
Whoa! Maybe...

1111
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:10,158
I was gonna ask you
to move in with me first.

1112
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,626
Oh, my God.
You expect me to move
to the suburbs with you?

1113
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:15,823
Reuben, are you insane?
Whoa! Why is that so crazy?

1114
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:18,924
People do that all the time.
They have kids,
they-they-they make plans,

1115
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:20,935
they get married,
they buy houses.
You know what, though?

1116
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:23,938
That's you, Reuben.
You do that, right?
That's what you do.

1117
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:27,271
I don't live my life that way.
Is your lack of a plan
that different than my plan?

1118
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,675
I don't...
I don't have a plan.
Yes, you do!

1119
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:33,442
You're on the non-plan plan.
I am not on a non-plan plan!

1120
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:37,111
You are too!
I've never met anybody more afraid
of committing to anything.

1121
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:40,280
I mean, you were a senior delegate
at the Model U.N., Polly.

1122
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:42,415
What the hell happened to you?
Whoa!

[Leland]
Wahoo!

1124
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:49,961
Come on, you mother!
You can do better than that!

1125
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:51,932
I've been living my life, okay?

1126
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,936
<i>I've been in good relationships</i>
<i>and I've been in shitty ones,</i>

and I've been happy
and I've been sad,

1128
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,599
and I've been lonely,
and that's what I've been doing,

1129
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:03,304
<i>which is a lot more than I can say</i>
<i>for some freak who thinks...</i>

he's gonna get the Ebola virus
from a bowl of mixed nuts.

1131
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:09,009
Those nuts have pee on them!
It's common sense!

1132
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,782
Oh, trust me, that is
so far beyond common sense, Reuben.

1133
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,982

1134
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:16,615
<i>You don't understand</i>
<i>what I grew up with.</i>

1135
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:18,660
I had a mother
who made me afraid of everything.

1136
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:22,060
Okay, well, big deal, Reuben.
My dad had a whole second family.

1137
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:24,565
- What?
- Yeah, on Long Island.

1138
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:27,864
<i>A wife and kids</i>
<i>and a golden retriever.</i>

1139
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,565
A second family?

1140
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:32,573
Whatever. Hey, you know what?

1141
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:36,372

<i>I am.</i>
<i>'Cause you know what?</i>

1143
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:41,274
I'm gonna make this
really, uh, easy for you, Reuben.

1144
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:44,251
I have, um...
I have no interest...

<i>and moving to the suburbs.</i>

1147
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:53,017
So here's what I think
your new plan should be.

1148
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,029
