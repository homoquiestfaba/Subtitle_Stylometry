1
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,980
Your son is arrived from London.

2
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,990
- Father ...
- John ...

3
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:27,950
You will see in my will the estate
of Norland was left to me in a way -

4
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:34,380
- that prevents me from dividing it
between my two families.

5
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:42,680
Norland, in its entirety,
is therefore yours by law.

6
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,890
And I am happy for you and Fanny.

7
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:57,360
But your stepmother, my wife and
daughters are left only 500 a year.

8
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,400
Barely enough to live on.
Nothing for the girls' dowries.

9
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,450
- You must help them.
- Of course.

10
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,120
You must promise to do this.

11
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,840
I promise, Father.
I promise.

12
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,550
Help them? What do you mean?

13
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:31,310
I mean to give them 3,000. The
interest will be an extra income.

14
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,320
- The gift will fulfil my promise.
- Without question. More than amply.

15
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,570
One had rather. on such occasions.
do too much than too little.

16
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,240
Of course, he did not stipulate
a particular sum.

17
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,460
What do you say to 1,500, then?

18
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,170
What brother would be so kind to his
real sisters. Let alone half-blood?

19
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,470
- They can hardly expect more.
- What can you afford?

20
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:16,520
100 a year to their mother is
better than losing 1,500 at once.

21
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,780
Should she live longer than 15 years
we'd be completely taken in.

22
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,610
People live forever
when an annuity is to be paid them.

23
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,080
20 now and then will amply
discharge my promise, you're right.

24
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:40,040
I'm convinced that your father
had no idea of giving them money.

25
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,760
- They will have 500 a year.
- What more could they want for?

26
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,760
No housekeeping, carriage, horses,
few servants, keeping no company ...

27
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,270
How comfortable!

28
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,350
They will be much more able
to give you something.

29
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,210
Marianne.
can you play something else?

30
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,930
Mamma has been weeping
since breakfast.

31
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,310
I meant something less mournful.

32
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,780
A visitor in my own home!
It is not to be borne. Elinor.

33
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:54,490
- Mamma, we have nowhere to go.
- John and Fanny will be here soon.

34
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,250
Do you expect me to be here
to welcome them? Vultures!

35
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,390
I will start making inquiries
for a new house at once.

36
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,020
Until then, we must try
to bear their coming.

37
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,990
Margaret, are you there? Come down,
John and Fanny will be here soon.

38
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,660
Why are they to live at Norland?
They have a house in London.

39
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:44,420
Houses go from father to son, not
father to daughter. It is the law.

40
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:51,720
- Come, we'll play with your atlas.
- It's not mine. it's their atlas.

41
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,140
Do sit down.

42
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:09,070
We are looking for a new home, and
can only retain Thomas and Betsy.

43
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,950
We're sorry
to have to leave you all.

44
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:19,370
But we are certain you will find the
new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.

45
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,080
My only real concern is how long
it will take them to move out.

46
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,990
- How is Mrs. Ferrars?
- She is always in good health.

47
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,070
My brother is with her this season.
Quite the most popular bachelor.

48
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,620
He has his own barouche.

49
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:09,630
- You have two brothers?
- Yes. Edward is the elder.

50
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,130
He's travelling up from Plymouth
and will break his journey here.

51
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:24,180
- If that is agreeable to you.
- Dear John ...

52
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,600
This is your home now.

53
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:36,660
- Fanny wants the key to the silver.
- What does Fanny want with it?

54
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,660
One can presume she wants
to count it. What are you doing?

55
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:48,710
Gifts for the servants. Where is
Margaret? She's taken to hiding.

56
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:55,590
- At least she can escape Fanny.
- You've not said a word to her.

57
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,300
I have.
I've said yes and no.

58
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,030
Good morning, Fanny.

59
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,280
Good morning, Miss Marianne.

60
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,160
How did you find the silver?
Was it all genuine?

61
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:32,090
- When may we expect your brother?
- Edward is due tomorrow.

62
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:39,680
He will not stay long. Will Margaret
give up her room for him?

63
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,230
The view is incomparable, and I
want him to see Norland at its best.

64
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,750
Mrs. Dashwood.
Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne.

65
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,300
My brother, Edward Ferrars.

66
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,550
Do sit down.

67
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:28,180
Where is Miss Margaret? I'm
beginning to doubt of her existence.

68
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:34,230
Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars. My youngest
is shy of strangers at present.

69
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:42,030
I am shy of strangers myself,
and I have nothing like her excuse.

70
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,490
How do you like your view,
Mr. Ferrars?

71
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:53,580
Very much. Your stables are handsome
and beautifully kept.

72
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,130
Stables?
Your windows overlook the lake.

73
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,590
An error led me to a family room,
but I've rectified the situation.

74
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,470
I am happily installed
in the guest quarters.

75
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,440
Tea!

76
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:18,570
They're all spoilt. Miss Margaret is
always up trees and under furniture.

77
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,360
I've barely had a civil word
from Marianne.

78
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:29,120
They've just lost their father.
Their lives will never be the same.

79
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,580
That is no excuse.

80
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,130
Library.

81
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,970
- These are mostly foreign.
- Indeed. Magnificent.

82
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,930
I've never liked the smell of books.

83
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,900
The dust, perhaps. I hear you have
great plans for the walnut grove.

84
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,030
I shall have it knocked down
to make place for a Grecian temple.

85
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,820
That does sound interesting.
Would you show me the site?

86
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:18,710
Too expensive, and we do not need
four bedrooms. We can share.

87
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,130
This one. then.

88
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,970
We have only 500 a year.

89
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,350
I'll send out more inquiries today.

90
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:39,150
Pardon my intrusion, but I think I
have found what you're looking for.

91
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,740
Won't you come out?
We haven't seen you all day.

92
00:11:52,910 --> 00:12:01,170
We'll have to enlarge it. Mattocks
will help you adjust toyour hours.

93
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:11,510
Forgive me, do you by any chance
have a reliable atlas?

94
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,810
- I believe so.
- I must check the Nile's position.

95
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,400
My sister tells me
it is in South America.

96
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:28,320
No!
No, she's quite wrong.

97
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,660
I believe it is in Belgium.

98
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,910
Surely not.
You must be thinking of the Volga.

99
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,380
- The Volga, which starts in ...
- In Vladivostok. and ends in ...

100
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,590
- Wimbledon.
- Yes. where coffee beans come from.

101
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,390
The source of the Nile
is in Abyssinia.

102
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,270
Is it? Interesting.

103
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,310
- How do you do? Edward Ferrars.
- Margaret Dashwood.

104
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,780
It adjoins this property,
and would be a desirable addition.

105
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:12,370
- I'll ride there and speak to ...
- Gibson.

106
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:19,750
- He'll be pleased enough to sell.
- He'll want more than it is worth.

107
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,410
Have I hurt you?

108
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,970
Thank you.
Forgive me.

109
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,980
That was my father's favourite.

110
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,730
Thank you for helping Margaret.
She's changed since you came.

111
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,900
I enjoy her company.

112
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,280
- Has she shown you the tree house?
- Not yet.

113
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,620
Would you do me the honour,
Miss Dashwood?

114
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,340
- It is very fine out.
- With pleasure.

115
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,340
- Margaret always wanted to travel.
- I know. She's off to China soon.

116
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:41,520
I'm to go as her servant, on the
understanding I'll be badly treated.

117
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:48,230
- What will your duties be?
- Sword fighting and swabbing.

118
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,150
Which will take precedence?

119
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,370
All I have ever wanted
is the quiet of a private life.

120
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,540
But my mother is determined
to see me distinguished.

121
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:17,930
Orator. Politician. Even a barrister
would do. if I drove a barouche.

122
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,050
What do you wish for?

123
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,020
I prefer the church, but that is not
smart enough for my mother.

124
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,810
She prefers the army,
but that is too smart for me.

125
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,900
- Would you stay in London?
- I hate London.

126
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:40,450
Country living is my ideal. A small
parish where I might do some good.

127
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,790
Keep chickens ...
Give very short sermons.

128
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,590
You feel idle and useless.
Imagine how that is compounded -

129
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,550
- when one has no choice
of any occupation whatsoever.

130
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,970
Our circumstances are therefore
precisely the same.

131
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,890
Except that you will inherit
your fortune.

132
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,860
We cannot even earnyours.

133
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:20,860
Perhaps Margaret is right.
Piracy isyour only option.

134
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,160
What is swabbing exactly?

135
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:31,250
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone."

136
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,920
'When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

137
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:42,470
"But l, beneath a rougher sea, and
whelmed in deeper gulfs than he ..."

138
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,720
No. Edward.

139
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,430
'"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone."

140
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,190
'When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

141
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,320
Can you not feel his despair?
Try again.

142
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:10,910
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone."

143
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,590
'When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

144
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,930
Mamma ...

145
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:29,100
Look.
This has just arrived.

146
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:34,690
"l should be pleased to offer you a
home at Barton Cottage, as soon ..."

147
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,230
- It's from Sir John Middleton.
- Even Elinor must approve the rent.

148
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,780
- Has she not yet seen this?
- No. I will fetch her.

149
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,080
Wait, let us delay.

150
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,290
I believe that Edward and Elinor
have formed an attachment.

151
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,590
It would be cruel to take her away
so soon. Devonshire is so far.

152
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:04,340
- Do you disapprove her choice?
- By no means.

153
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,350
- Edward is very amiable.
- Amiable? But ..?

154
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:15,060
There is something wanting.
He is too sedate. His reading ...

155
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,610
Elinor has not your feelings.

156
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:25,110
Can he love her? Can the soul
be satisfied with polite affections?

157
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,120
To love is to be on fire.
Like Juliet. Guinevere. Heloise.

158
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:36,040
- They made rather pathetic ends.
- Pathetic? To die for love?

159
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,210
- What could be more glorious?
- Your romantic sensibilities ...

160
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:55,230
"Is love a fancy or a feeling? No,
it is immortal as immaculate truth."

161
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,520
"It is not a blossom shed
when outh drops from life's stem."

162
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:07,240
"It grows without water, nor ray of
promise cheats the pensive gloom."

163
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,370
A pity
Edward has no passion for reading.

164
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:18,790
You asked him to read.
then you made him nervous.

165
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,920
Your behaviour is cordial. You
like him in spite of his reading.

166
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:33,270
I think him everything
that is amiable and worthy.

167
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,350
Praise. indeed.

168
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,690
He shall have my devotion when
you tell me he is to be my brother.

169
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,320
- What shall I do without you?
- Without me?

170
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,580
I'm sure you will be very happy,
but promise you won't live far away.

171
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:59,790
- There is no question of ...
- Do you love him?

172
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:08,180
I do not deny that I think
very highly of him. That I ...

173
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,890
... greatly esteem him.
I like him.

174
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:21,400
Esteem? Like? Use these words again
and I shall leave the room!

175
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,610
Believe my feelings to be stronger.
Further than that. do not believe.

176
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,450
Is love a fancy or a feeling?

177
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,620
- Or a Ferrars?
- Go to bed.

178
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:43,170
"l do not deny
that I think very highly of him."

179
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,090
"That I ... greatly esteem him."

180
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,760
"That I like him."

181
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:15,700
We are so happy
that you invited Edward to Norland.

182
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,200
We're all very fond of him.

183
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:25,960
We have great hopes for him.
Mother expects much of him.

184
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:32,220
And in marriage. She's determined
both he and Robert will marry well.

185
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,510
But I hope she desires them
to marry for love.

186
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:43,690
The heart doesn't always lead us
in the most suitable direction.

187
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:52,280
Edward is a compassionate person.
Penniless women prey on that type.

188
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:59,750
Having entered into an understanding
he would never go back on his word.

189
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,250
But it would lead to his ruin.

190
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:09,170
I'm worried. Mother will withdraw
all financial support from him -

191
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:15,590
- should he plant affection in less
exalted ground than he deserves.

192
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,930
I understand you perfectly.

193
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,150
Devonshire?

194
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:33,200
My cousin, Sir John Middleton,
has offered us a small house.

195
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,030
He must be a man of property.

196
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,500
He's a widower from Barton Park.
It is Barton Cottage he has offered.

197
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,630
A cottage? Charming.
A cottage is always very snug.

198
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,880
You will not leave
before the summer?

199
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,880
We can no longer trespass
upon your sister's goodwill.

200
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,430
- You will come and stay with us.
- I should like that.

201
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,850
Edward has long been expected
byyour mother.

202
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,650
Come as soon as you can, Edward.
Remember, you're always welcome.

203
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:42,510
- Can't you take him with you?
- We can't afford him.

204
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,560
Perhaps he could make himself useful
in the kitchen ... Forgive me.

205
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,110
Miss Dashwood ...

206
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:02,120
Elinor ... I must speak to you.

207
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,710
There is something of
great importance that I need to ...

208
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:17,930
... tell you ...
about my education.

209
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,470
- Your education?
- Yes.

210
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,650
It was conducted.
oddly enough, in Plymouth.

211
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,990
- Do you know it?
- Plymouth? No.

212
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:43,580
I was four years there.

213
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,370
In a school run by Mr. Pratt.

214
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,130
- Pratt?
- Precisely. Pratt.

215
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,590
While I was there ...

216
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,260
That is to say, he had a ...
has a ...

217
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,650
You're needed in London
this instant.

218
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:17,990
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- Mamma wishes you to leave at once.

219
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,580
Excuse me.

220
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,690
Edward promised
he would bring the atlas to Barton.

221
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:05,160
I'll wager he will do so
in less than a fortnight.

222
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,620
Dear Edward ...

223
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,930
Hello there!

224
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,570
Sir John ...

225
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:53,960
Dear ladies!
Upon my word! Here you are!

226
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:00,090
- Sir John, your kindness ...
- None of that! Hush, please!

227
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,090
Here is my dear mamma-in-law,
Mrs. Jennings.

228
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:10,350
You must be Mrs. Dashwood. Was
Your journey tolerable? Poor souls!

229
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,890
Why did you not
come up to the park first?

230
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,020
- We saw you pass.
- I made John call the carriage.

231
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,900
- She would not wait.
- We have so little company.

232
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:29,910
I feel as though I know you already.
Delightful creatures!

233
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,080
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily.
- Dear Sir John. we cannot ...

234
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:43,090
No refusals! I'm quite deaf to them.
But I insist!

235
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,090
Let us settle in.
But thank you very much.

236
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,500
Send your man up for the carriage
as soon as you're ready. Goodbye.

237
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,710
Don't thank us.

238
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,520
Your feet are cold.

239
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,760
What have you been doing?
You can grow potatoes in this dirt.

240
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:18,730
It's cold. I'm cold.

241
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:32,660
Where can Brandon be?
I hope he's not lamed his horse.

242
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:37,490
Col. Brandon is the most
eligible bachelor in the county.

243
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:43,920
He is bound to go for one of you.
He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.

244
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,920
But I dare say she's left her heart
behind in Sussex.

245
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:54,300
I see you, Miss Marianne! I think
I've unearthed a secret.

246
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,560
You are worse than my best pointer.

247
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:06,060
Is he a butcher. baker. candlestick
maker? I'll winkle it out of you.

248
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:12,740
- She's good at winkling.
- We've none of us any secrets here.

249
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,410
Or if we do.
we do not keep them long.

250
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,290
- He's curate of the parish.
- Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.

251
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,590
- Give us a clue. Is he in uniform?
- He has no profession.

252
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,010
He's a gentleman?

253
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:38,720
- You know there is no such person.
- There is. His name begins with F.

254
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,690
F? A promising letter.

255
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:50,730
Foster?
Forrest? Fotheringay? Featherty?

256
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,660
- Fortescue?
- Fondant?

257
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,200
Might I play your pianoforte?

258
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,830
Yes. of course.

259
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,130
- We don't stand on ceremony here.
- Please forgive ...

260
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:14,300
I cannot remember when we last
had a song in the house.

261
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:39,890
Brandon! Come and meet
our beautiful new neighbours.

262
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:45,890
What a pity you're late.
You have not heardyour songbird.

263
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,390
A great pity.

264
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,480
This is my good friend Col. Brandon.
We served in the East Indies.

265
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:59,950
- Not a better fellow in the world.
- You've been to the East Indies?

266
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,530
- What's it like?
- Hot.

267
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,660
The air is full of spices.

268
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:14,250
Now. Miss Dashwood.
it's your turn to entertain us.

269
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:19,090
And I believe I know
what key you will sing in.

270
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,840
F-major ...

271
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,650
You have no right to parade
your ignorant assumptions ...

272
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,580
- You told me.
- I told you nothing.

273
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:49,330
- They'll meet him when he comes.
- You don't speak of such things.

274
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,670
- Everyone else was.
- Mrs. Jennings is not "everyone".

275
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:58,960
I like her. She talks about things.
We never talk about things.

276
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:06,930
If you can say nothing appropriate,
limit your remarks to the weather.

277
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,690
Surely they have enough reeds
for a Moses basket.

278
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,020
You know what they're saying?

279
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:02,860
Word is, you've developed a taste
for certain company. And why not?

280
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:08,120
A man like you in his prime ...
She'd be a fortunate young lady.

281
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,830
Marianne Dashwood would
no more think of me than of you.

282
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,210
- Don't think of yourself so meanly.
- And all the better for her.

283
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,660
Besotted ... An excellent match.

284
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:54,410
- He's rich and she's handsome.
- How long have you known him?

285
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,750
As long as I've been here,
and I came 15 years back.

286
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,090
His estate is but four miles hence.
He and John are very thick.

287
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:10,350
He has no wife and children.
He had a tragic history.

288
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:17,440
He loved a ward to the family.
They were not permitted to marry.

289
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,270
- On what grounds?
- Eliza was poor.

290
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,860
She was flung out of the house,
and he was packed off to the army.

291
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:31,280
I think he'd have done himself harm
if not for John.

292
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:36,540
- What became of the lady?
- She was passed from man to man.

293
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,290
She disappeared from good society.

294
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,500
When Brandon returned from India
he searched and searched. -

295
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,930
- only to find her dying
in a poorhouse.

296
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:54,220
I thought my daughter Charlotte
might have cheered him up.

297
00:37:54,390 --> 00:38:00,650
Look at him now!
So attentive!

298
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:07,570
- I should try a little experiment.
- Please. Let the colonel alone.

299
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,370
All suitors need a little help.

300
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:19,790
- We haven't heard you play of late.
- You have a superior musician here.

301
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:27,590
Brandon shares your passion for
music. He plays the pianoforte well.

302
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:34,180
You know as many melancholy tunes
as Miss Marianne.

303
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:39,810
You must play us a duet.
Let us see you both side by side.

304
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:45,270
I do not know any duets.
Forgive me, Colonel.

305
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:57,290
Will we never have peace? The rent
is low. but it comes on hard terms.

306
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:02,330
Mrs. Jennings has nothing to do but
marry off everyone else's daughters.

307
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,000
There's a parcel arrived.

308
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,300
Look!

309
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,220
When is a man safe from such wit.
if infirmity does not protect him?

310
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:21,600
If he is infirm.
then I am at death's door.

311
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:28,690
- He complained of rheumatism.
- "A slight ache" was his phrase.

312
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,660
Edward said
he would bring it himself.

313
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:45,920
"lt gives me great pleasure to
restore this atlas to its owner."

314
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:52,220
"Business prevents my delivering it,
which will hurt me more than you."

315
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,010
"Memories of your kindness must
sustain me. and I remain -

316
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,470
- your devoted servant,
E.C. Ferrars."

317
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,480
- Why hasn't he come?
- He says he's busy, dear.

318
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:12,610
- He said he'd come. Why hasn't he?
- I'm taking you for a walk.

319
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,740
- It is going to rain.
- It is not going to rain.

320
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:24,410
I fear
Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.

321
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,760
- You must miss him. Elinor.
- We are not engaged, Mamma.

322
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,850
- But he loves you, dearest.
- I am by no means assured of that.

323
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:49,310
And had he such a preference,
there would certainly be obstacles -

324
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,860
- to his marrying a woman of no rank
who cannot afford to buy sugar.

325
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:59,700
- But your heart must tell you ...
- It is better to use one's head.

326
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,420
- It can't be good for me.
- It is. Stop complaining.

327
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:18,510
- It's giving me a cough.
- It is not giving you a cough.

328
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,640
It's lovely. Come on, catch up!

329
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:30,020
- Over there is a field of rabbits.
- I don't want to see rabbits.

330
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:40,370
- Is anything superior to this?
- I told you it would rain.

331
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:44,830
- Blue sky! Let us chase it!
- I'm not supposed to run.

332
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,630
Are you hurt?

333
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:03,260
- I cannot walk. Run and fetch help.
- I will run as fast as I can.

334
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,900
Margaret!

335
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,080
Don't be afraid. He's quite safe.

336
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,380
- Are you hurt?
- Only my ankle.

337
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:40,630
May I have your permission to
ascertain if there are any breaks?

338
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,610
It is not broken.

339
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,290
Can you put your arm about my neck?

340
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,540
Allow me to escort you home.

341
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,420
At last!

342
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:23,930
She fell down and he's carrying her!

343
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:27,220
Marianne, are you hurt?

344
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,060
It's a twisted ankle.

345
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:35,230
It's not serious.
I felt the bone. and it's sound.

346
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,360
- I cannot begin to thank you.
- Do not think of it.

347
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:45,280
- Will you not be seated?
- I'd leave a water mark.

348
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:52,580
- But permit me to call tomorrow.
- We shall look forward to it.

349
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,920
I'll show you out.

350
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,420
Margaret, get the gentleman's hat.

351
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:07,350
- His name!
- To whom are we so much obliged?

352
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:11,020
John Willoughby of Allenham
at your service.

353
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,020
John Willoughby of Allenham ...

354
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,440
What an impressive gentleman!

355
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:24,240
He lifted me as if I weighed no more
than a dried leaf.

356
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,490
- Tell me if I hurt you.
- She feels no pain, Mamma.

357
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,750
Margaret, ask Betsy to make up
a cold compress.

358
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:37,330
Please don't say anything important.

359
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:43,010
- He expressed himself well.
- With decorum and honour.

360
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:48,680
- And spirit and wit and feeling.
- And economy. Ten words at most.

361
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:52,770
- Change, or you'll catch a cold.
- What care I for colds?

362
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:58,440
- You'll care when your nose swells.
- You're right. Help me.

363
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,200
He's worth catching. Marianne must
not have all the men to herself.

364
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:13,080
- But what do you know of him?
- There's not a bolder rider.

365
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:18,250
But what are his tastes.
his passions, his pursuits?

366
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:28,680
- He has a smart little pointer ...
- Where is Allenham?

367
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:34,520
Nice little estate three miles east.
He is to inherit it from a relative.

368
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,060
Lady Allen is the name.

369
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:47,280
It's Col. Brandon.
I should go out and keep watch.

370
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,410
You're looking out for Willoughby.
You'll not think of Brandon now.

371
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,210
Come in.

372
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:04,000
Good morning, Brandon.

373
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:09,890
- How is the invalid?
- Thank you so much, Colonel.

374
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:16,810
Why set your cap at Willoughby when
you've already made such a conquest?

375
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,100
I'll not set my cap at anyone.

376
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:25,280
- Lady Allen's nephew?
- He visits. for he's to inherit.

377
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:33,910
He has a pretty estate of his own.
Combe Magna in Somerset.

378
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:40,080
I'd not give him up to a younger
sister for tumbling down hills.

379
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:50,130
The man himself. Come. Brandon.
We know when we are not wanted.

380
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,140
Thank you so much for calling.

381
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:58,520
Marianne. the colonel and Sir John
are leaving.

382
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,230
Goodbye.
Thank you for the flowers.

383
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:19,330
- How do you do, Colonel?
- How do you do, more like.

384
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:42,690
- Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure!
- The pleasure is all mine.

385
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:48,110
- Miss Marianne has not caught cold?
- You've found out my name.

386
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,950
The area is crawling with my spies.
You cannot venture out to nature ...

387
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:58,990
- So nature must be brought to you.
- How beautiful.

388
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:06,250
- These are not from the hothouse.
- Mine is not the first offering.

389
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:13,300
- They come from an obliging field.
- I always prefer wild flowers.

390
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:18,100
- Would you ..?
-your gratitude is beyond words.

391
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:26,230
I've grieved for this lonely house.
Then I heard it was taken.

392
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,650
I felt an interest which nothing can
account for but my present delight.

393
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:36,200
Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby.

394
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:40,540
Who is reading
Shakespeare's sonnets?

395
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,710
- Marianne is reading them out.
- And which are your favourites?

396
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:49,090
Mine is 1 16.

397
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:53,420
"Let me not to the marriage
of true minds admit impediments."

398
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:57,340
"Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds. -

399
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:01,640
- or bends with the remover
to remove ..."

400
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:06,600
- How does it continue?
- "No. it is an ever fixed mark ..."

401
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:12,990
- "That looks on tempests..."
- Is it "tempests"?

402
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:21,370
It's strange you are reading these.
I carry them with me always.

403
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:33,760
Until tomorrow then ...

404
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:41,510
My pocket sonnets are yours.
A talisman against further injury.

405
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,270
Goodbye. Thank you.

406
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:56,530
Good work. Marianne. You covered
Shakespeare, Scott, poetry.

407
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:03,080
When you know his views on romance,
you'll have nothing left to talk of.

408
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:09,080
I suppose I erred against decorum.
I should have talked of the weather.

409
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:13,670
Mr. Willoughby can be in no doubt
of your enthusiasm for him.

410
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,840
Should I hide my regard?

411
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:23,140
- No. but we know so little of him.
- Time does not determine intimacy.

412
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:28,310
Seven years is too little for some,
seven days is enough for others.

413
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,190
- Or seven hours. in this case.
- I feel I know him already.

414
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:38,650
Had I more shallow feelings, I could
perhaps conceal them as you do.

415
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:43,580
- I'm sorry ...
- Don't trouble yourself, Marianne.

416
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,670
I do not understand her.

417
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,030
Marianne ...

418
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:27,950
- Haven't you finished yet?
- No. Patience.

419
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,470
You're not going to deny us
beef as well as sugar?

420
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,640
- There is nothing under ten pence.
- Do you want us to starve?

421
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:52,850
No.
Just not to eat beef.

422
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,980
If my behaviour was improper,
I should be sensible of it.

423
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:45,950
It has caused impertinent remarks.
Do you not doubt your discretion?

424
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:53,710
If Mrs. Jennings' remarks prove
impropriety, we are all offending.

425
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,630
Good morning, Colonel.

426
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:04,590
Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne.
I come to issue an invitation.

427
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,970
A picnic on my estate
at Delaford.

428
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:16,810
If you would care to join us
on Thursday next.

429
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:22,360
Mrs. Jenning's daughter and husband
are travelling up especially.

430
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,820
We should be delighted, Colonel.

431
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:32,910
I will, of course, be including
Mr. Willoughby in the party.

432
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,250
I should be delighted to join you.

433
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,130
Good morning, Miss Dashwood.
Good morning, Colonel.

434
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,510
The colonel has invited us
to Delaford.

435
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:54,430
- I hear you have a fine pianoforte.
- A Broadwood Grand.

436
00:53:54,600 --> 00:54:00,110
- Then I shall play for you all.
- We shall look forward to it.

437
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:20,670
- Your sister seems very happy.
- She does not hide her emotions.

438
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:26,470
Her romantic prejudices
tend to set propriety at naught.

439
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:32,220
- She is wholly unspoilt.
- Rather too unspoilt.

440
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:37,680
The sooner she is acquainted with
the ways of the world, the better.

441
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,490
I knew a lady with the same
sweetness of temper -

442
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:52,320
- who was forced into a
better acquaintance with the world.

443
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:57,250
The result was only
ruination and despair.

444
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:02,630
Do not desire it. Miss Dashwood.

445
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:09,800
Col. Brandon's lawn
is perfect for kite launching.

446
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:12,680
Mind the pretty ribbons.

447
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:20,230
Imagine my surprise when Charlotte
and her master appeared with Lucy.

448
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,440
The last person I expected to see.

449
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:28,650
She came to join in the fun.
There is no such luxury at home.

450
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:32,530
I'd not seen you for so long.

451
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:36,790
You sly thing! It was the Dashwoods
she wanted to see.

452
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:41,620
I've heard nothing but "Dashwood"
for I don't know how long.

453
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:47,840
What do you think of them? My mother
wrote of little else in her letters.

454
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:52,180
- Are they not as she described?
- Nothing like.

455
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:55,470
You are quite rude today.

456
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:01,850
He's to be an MP. and he is forced
to make everybody like him.

457
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:08,030
- I said nothing so irrational.
- Mr. Palmer's so droll.

458
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:12,990
Here he comes!
Now you shall see, Charlotte.

459
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,330
Hello, Mr. Willoughby!

460
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,790
You must meet my daughter Charlotte,
and Mr. Palmer.

461
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:33,840
- Andyour cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.
- Welcome toyour party.

462
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:42,430
May I sit beside you?

463
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,810
I've longed to meet you. I've heard
nothing but praise for you.

464
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:54,530
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are
too excessive in their compliments.

465
00:56:54,700 --> 00:57:00,410
The praise came from another source.
One not inclined to exaggeration.

466
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,870
What can this be?

467
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:17,970
Is Col. Brandon here?

468
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,860
- My horse!
- What's the matter?

469
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:34,110
- I must away to London.
- Impossible!

470
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:39,990
We can't picnic withoutyour host.
Come up to town tomorrow.

471
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:46,710
- Or wait until we return.
- I can't afford to lose one minute.

472
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:51,800
- Forgive me.
- I hope it's nothing serious.

473
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,380
Upon my soul,
this is all very unusual.

474
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:04,770
- Frailty, thy name is Brandon.
- Some cannot bear pleasure.

475
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:09,400
You are a wicked pair.
Col. Brandon will be missed.

476
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:16,450
Why? Everyone speaks well of him,
but no one remembers to talk to him.

477
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:20,280
Nonsense. He is highly respected
at Barton Park.

478
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:25,410
- Which is enough censure in itself.
- Really, Willoughby.

479
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:30,500
Come, come, Mr. Impudence.
I know your wicked ways.

480
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:37,340
Reveal your beau. No secrets between
friends. I'll winkle it out of you.

481
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:44,890
I'll have you married to the colonel
by tea, or I'll swallow my bonnet.

482
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:49,940
- As if you could marry him.
- Why should you dislike him?

483
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:55,980
Because he threatened me with rain
when I wanted it fine.

484
00:58:56,150 --> 00:59:02,450
He found fault with my high flyer
and will not buy my brown mare.

485
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:06,080
If it will be
of satisfaction to you, -

486
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:11,250
- I believe his character to be. in
all other respects, irreproachable.

487
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:17,010
In return for this acknowledgement,
don't deny me the privilege -

488
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:21,800
- of disliking him
as much as I adore ...

489
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:29,480
... this cottage.

490
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:36,020
- I have plans for improvements.
- That. I will never consent to.

491
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:40,450
Not a stone must be added
to its walls.

492
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:45,830
Were I rich enough, I'd rebuild
Combe Magna to this exact image.

493
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:52,580
- With a fire that smokes?
- Especially the fire that smokes.

494
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:57,800
Then I'd be as happy at Combe
as I've been at Barton.

495
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:03,720
But this place has one claim on
my affections none other can share.

496
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:07,220
Promise never to change it.

497
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:19,230
I'm honoured you risk your honour by
seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.

498
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:24,910
- That is what Elinor would say.
- And she would be right.

499
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:30,580
Miss Marianne, will you grant me
an interview tomorrow ... alone?

500
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:35,330
- Willoughby, we are always alone.
- But there is ...

501
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,710
There is something very particular
I should like to ask you.

502
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:45,890
Of course. I shall ask Mamma
if I may stay behind from church.

503
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:50,220
Thank you.

504
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:54,100
Until tomorrow. then.

505
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:10,200
Oh. Virtue ...

506
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:16,500
Silently and with fear, enter the
hearts of all that hear me this day.

507
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:20,800
Will he kneel down when he asks her?

508
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,420
They always kneel down.

509
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:40,980
What is wrong, dearest?

510
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:45,950
Willoughby?
What is the matter?

511
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:50,950
Forgive me ...
I am sent ...

512
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:56,540
Lady Allen exercised the privilege
of riches upon a dependent cousin.

513
01:01:56,710 --> 01:02:02,590
- She is sending me to London.
- This morning?

514
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:08,510
What a disappointment. Your business
won't detain you for long, I hope?

515
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:14,770
You are kind. but I have no idea of
returning immediately to Devonshire.

516
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:20,900
- I am invited only once a year.
- Can you wait foryour invitation?

517
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:30,870
My engagements are of such a
nature ... I dare not flatter my ...

518
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:36,330
It's folly to linger in this manner.
I will not torment myself further.

519
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,500
Willoughby, come back!

520
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:44,000
Ask Betsy to make a cup of tea
for Marianne.

521
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:50,220
- What is wrong, my love?
- Do not ask me questions.

522
01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:00,650
- They must have quarrelled.
- That is unlikely.

523
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:07,320
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves
of his regard for Marianne.

524
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:12,450
- An excuse to send him away.
- Then why did he not say so?

525
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:17,120
- It's not like him to be secretive.
- What do you suspect?

526
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:24,670
- Why was his manner so guilty?
- You think he's been acting a part?

527
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:29,550
- No. He loves her. I am sure.
- Of course!

528
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:33,720
Has he left her any assurance
of his return?

529
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:36,600
Ask if he proposed.

530
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:41,980
No! I cannot force a confidence
from Marianne. Neither should you.

531
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:47,190
We must trust her to confide in us
in her own time.

532
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,070
There was something underhand
in his manner.

533
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,870
You will think the worst of him.

534
01:03:54,030 --> 01:04:00,040
I give him the benefit of my
good opinion. He deserves no less.

535
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:03,040
I am very fond of Willoughby.

536
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:06,670
Mamma ... Mamma!

537
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:14,800
She would not let me in.

538
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:05,650
- If only this rain would stop.
- If only youwould stop.

539
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:11,030
'Twas you took her off my hands,
Mr. Palmer. A good bargain, too.

540
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:17,200
Now I have the whip hand over you,
for you cannot give her back.

541
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:24,410
Marianne, play with us. Looking at
the weather will not bring him back.

542
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:28,840
- She ate nothing at dinner.
- We're all forlorn these days.

543
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:37,090
Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now
we might haveyour ... discussion.

544
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:42,310
-your discussion?
- I've longed to ask you something.

545
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:49,190
You might think me impertinent.
It is an odd question.

546
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:55,780
If only he'd gone to Combe Magna.
We live but half a mile away.

547
01:05:55,950 --> 01:06:01,450
- Five and a half.
- I cannot believe it is that far.

548
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:06,750
- I can't believe it.
- Try.

549
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:14,420
You may ask any manner of question
if that is of any help.

550
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:16,630
Are you acquainted with your
sister-in-law's mother Mrs. Ferrars?

551
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:26,982
Fanny's mother?
No. I have never met her.

552
01:06:27,152 --> 01:06:33,782
You must think me strange to ask.
If only I dared tell ...

553
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:39,542
If she tells you of the famous
Mr. F, you must pass it on.

554
01:06:41,452 --> 01:06:45,582
Will you take a turn with me,
Miss Dashwood?

555
01:06:49,252 --> 01:06:54,722
I had no idea you were at all
connected with that family.

556
01:06:54,882 --> 01:06:59,312
I am nothing to Mrs. Ferrars
at present.

557
01:06:59,472 --> 01:07:06,982
But the time may come when we
may be very intimately connected.

558
01:07:07,152 --> 01:07:10,612
What do you mean?

559
01:07:12,572 --> 01:07:16,742
Do you have an understanding
with Fanny's brother Robert?

560
01:07:16,912 --> 01:07:23,002
The youngest? No.
I have never met him in my life.

561
01:07:23,162 --> 01:07:28,672
- With Edward.
- Edward Ferrars?

562
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:35,092
Edward and I have been
secretly engaged these five years.

563
01:07:37,932 --> 01:07:41,562
You may well be surprised.

564
01:07:41,722 --> 01:07:48,312
I only mention it because I entirely
trust you to keepyour secret.

565
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:53,362
Edward looks on you
quite as his own sister.

566
01:07:54,442 --> 01:07:59,912
I am sorry.
Surely we ...

567
01:08:00,072 --> 01:08:04,252
We surely do not mean
the same Mr. Ferrars.

568
01:08:04,412 --> 01:08:10,922
Yes. He was under the tutelage
of my uncle, Mr. Pratt, in Plymouth.

569
01:08:11,092 --> 01:08:16,842
- Has he never spoken of it?
- Yes ... Yes. I believe he has.

570
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:26,392
I wanted his mother's approval,
but we loved each other so much.

571
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:36,032
You must have seen how capable he is
of making a woman attached to him.

572
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:42,452
I cannot pretend it has not
been hard on both of us.

573
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:47,662
We can scarcely meet
above twice a year.

574
01:08:56,672 --> 01:09:00,762
You seem out of sorts.
Are you quite well?

575
01:09:00,932 --> 01:09:07,272
- I have not offended you?
- I must know what you are saying.

576
01:09:07,432 --> 01:09:14,692
- Promise me you'll not tell a soul.
- Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed.

577
01:09:15,862 --> 01:09:18,612
I give you my word.

578
01:09:18,782 --> 01:09:24,242
- What has so fascinated you?
- Tell us all!

579
01:09:24,412 --> 01:09:31,622
- We were talking of London.
- Do you hear that, Charlotte?

580
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:37,002
- Charlotte and I concocted a plan.
- The best plan in the world!

581
01:09:37,172 --> 01:09:41,842
I make for London shortly,
and I invite you, Lucy, -

582
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:46,892
- and both the Misses Dashwood
to join me.

583
01:09:49,392 --> 01:09:52,652
Can I go?

584
01:09:52,812 --> 01:09:58,782
You will all come to my Chelsea home
and taste of the season's delights.

585
01:09:58,942 --> 01:10:01,742
Please, can I go?

586
01:10:01,902 --> 01:10:08,912
- Do you not long for it to be so?
- I came here with no other view.

587
01:10:10,202 --> 01:10:17,842
- We can't leave our mother.
- She can spare you very well.

588
01:10:18,002 --> 01:10:22,932
- Of course she can!
- I could not be more delighted.

589
01:10:23,092 --> 01:10:28,512
I will brook no refusal.
Let us strike hands on the bargain.

590
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:35,272
If I don't have you married by
Michaelmas, it will not be my fault.

591
01:10:43,112 --> 01:10:46,702
I've never been so grateful.

592
01:10:46,872 --> 01:10:52,292
I shall see Willoughby,
and you will see Edward.

593
01:10:52,452 --> 01:10:57,792
- Are you asleep?
- With you in the room?

594
01:10:58,632 --> 01:11:06,302
You can't feel as calm as you look.
Oh, I will never sleep tonight.

595
01:11:06,472 --> 01:11:10,892
What were you and Miss Steele
talking about so long?

596
01:11:11,062 --> 01:11:15,102
Nothing of significance.

597
01:11:31,742 --> 01:11:38,002
How do you think I like poking about
in that big house without Charlotte?

598
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:45,172
I wrote to Edward, yet I do not know
how much I may see of him.

599
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:50,892
Secrecy is vital.
He'll never be able to call.

600
01:11:51,062 --> 01:11:55,942
My only comfort has been
the constancy of his affection.

601
01:11:56,102 --> 01:12:01,022
You're fortunate never to have had
any doubts on that score.

602
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:08,282
I am of a jealous nature. Had he
talked more of one young woman ...

603
01:12:08,452 --> 01:12:13,452
But he's not given a moment's alarm
on that count.

604
01:12:13,622 --> 01:12:18,582
Imagine how glad he'll be
to learn that we are friends.

605
01:12:23,712 --> 01:12:28,472
- Have you missed me, Pigeon?
- Very much, ma'am.

606
01:12:28,632 --> 01:12:34,392
- Is everything in order?
- I suggest the ordering of coal.

607
01:12:34,562 --> 01:12:41,272
There you are, Pooter.
Still alive, I see ... Tea, Pigeon.

608
01:12:41,442 --> 01:12:47,992
You do not waste any time.
Give it to Pigeon.

609
01:12:48,152 --> 01:12:56,872
Mrs. Jennings says your sister will
buy her wedding clothes in town.

610
01:12:58,002 --> 01:13:03,002
John and Fanny are in town.
We should be forced to see them.

611
01:13:11,682 --> 01:13:15,682
I think it was for next door.

612
01:13:15,852 --> 01:13:21,352
Sit down for two seconds.
You're making me nervous.

613
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:41,542
Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby.

614
01:13:41,712 --> 01:13:44,922
Indeed it is.

615
01:13:50,842 --> 01:13:53,762
Excuse me. Colonel.

616
01:13:53,932 --> 01:13:56,722
Colonel ...

617
01:13:58,182 --> 01:14:03,152
What a pleasure to see you. Have you
been in London all this while?

618
01:14:03,312 --> 01:14:07,112
What a pleasure to see you. Have you
been in London all this while?

619
01:14:07,272 --> 01:14:12,242
I have heard
reports through town ...

620
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:18,372
Tell me once and for all:

621
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:23,042
Is everything resolved between
your sister and Mr. Willoughby?

622
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:31,922
Though neither one has informed me
of their understanding, -

623
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:37,512
- I have no doubt
of their mutual affection.

624
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:41,432
Thank you, Miss Dashwood.

625
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:45,812
To your sister
I wish all imaginable happiness.

626
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:53,242
To Mr. Willoughby, that
he may endeavour to deserve her.

627
01:14:54,912 --> 01:14:58,412
What do you mean?

628
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:02,752
Forgive me ...

629
01:15:05,622 --> 01:15:08,962
Forgive me.

630
01:15:20,102 --> 01:15:26,402
- Where is dear Edward. John?
- And who is Edward?

631
01:15:26,562 --> 01:15:31,532
My brother.
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

632
01:15:31,692 --> 01:15:35,822
Ferrars with an F?

633
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:46,502
Are there any messages?
No message at all? No cards?

634
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:52,052
- You do not ask for your messages.
- No, for I do not expect any.

635
01:15:52,212 --> 01:15:56,262
I have
very little acquaintance in town.

636
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:18,322
Not another word about the ham bone.
You and Cartwright sort it out.

637
01:16:18,492 --> 01:16:24,122
- No messages.
- Do not fret, my dear.

638
01:16:24,292 --> 01:16:29,332
This good weather is keeping
many a sportsman in the country.

639
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:34,882
But the frost will soon
drive them to town. Depend on it.

640
01:16:35,052 --> 01:16:38,302
I had not thought of that.

641
01:16:38,472 --> 01:16:41,512
And Miss Dashwood
may set her heart at rest, -

642
01:16:41,682 --> 01:16:47,432
- for your sister-in-law is inviting
Mr. F to the ball tonight.

643
01:16:48,352 --> 01:16:48,892
Do be careful.
the horses have been here.

644
01:16:48,892 --> 01:16:52,692
Do be careful.
the horses have been here.

645
01:16:54,022 --> 01:16:58,742
It is beginning to rain also.
Follow me.

646
01:17:27,562 --> 01:17:31,402
Mamma!
This is very merry!

647
01:17:32,812 --> 01:17:37,902
- Do you spy anyone we know?
- No. Mr. Palmer has a better view.

648
01:17:38,072 --> 01:17:43,032
- Do you see anyone we know?
- Unfortunately not.

649
01:17:43,202 --> 01:17:48,792
How can you be such a tease?
There is Mrs. John Dashwood.

650
01:17:52,332 --> 01:17:55,792
Come along, my dears.

651
01:17:58,262 --> 01:18:01,182
There you are!

652
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:05,972
How hot it is ...
You are not alone. I trust?

653
01:18:06,142 --> 01:18:10,892
John is just gone
to fetch my brother.

654
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:17,362
Your brother! I declare.
this is good news, indeed.

655
01:18:17,522 --> 01:18:20,532
I shall faint clean away.

656
01:18:20,692 --> 01:18:25,782
Mrs. Jennings, I am pleased
to meet you. My brother-in-law ...

657
01:18:25,952 --> 01:18:28,202
Mr. Robert Ferrars.

658
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:33,252
Miss Dashwood.
Miss Steele. Miss Marianne.

659
01:18:34,582 --> 01:18:38,462
My dear ladies, we meet at last.

660
01:18:40,172 --> 01:18:44,392
You must be the younger brother.
Is Mr. Edward not here?

661
01:18:44,552 --> 01:18:49,522
- Miss Dashwood was counting on him.
- He is far too busy.

662
01:18:49,682 --> 01:18:55,022
There's no special acquaintance here
to make his attendance worthwhile.

663
01:18:55,192 --> 01:19:00,732
What are the men about these days?
Are they in hiding?

664
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:08,332
In the absence of your brother
you must dance with Miss Dashwood.

665
01:19:11,702 --> 01:19:14,712
It would be my honour.

666
01:19:20,002 --> 01:19:26,642
Perhaps Miss Steele might consider
reserving the allemande?

667
01:20:06,342 --> 01:20:11,262
You reside in Devonshire.
Miss Dashwood!

668
01:20:13,682 --> 01:20:17,812
- In a cottage!
- Yes.

669
01:20:18,942 --> 01:20:24,112
I am excessively fond of a cottage.

670
01:20:24,282 --> 01:20:29,532
If I had any money to spare,
I should build one myself.

671
01:20:41,342 --> 01:20:44,002
Mr. Willoughby ...

672
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:47,972
- How do you do, Miss Dashwood?
- Very well.

673
01:20:48,132 --> 01:20:52,932
- How is your family?
- We are all extremely well.

674
01:20:54,472 --> 01:20:57,812
Thank You for your kind inquiry.

675
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:02,022
Willoughby!

676
01:21:12,832 --> 01:21:16,042
Good God, Willoughby ...

677
01:21:17,962 --> 01:21:21,922
Will you not shake hands with me?

678
01:21:22,082 --> 01:21:26,052
How do you do, Miss Marianne?

679
01:21:27,342 --> 01:21:32,342
What is the matter?
Why have you not come to see me?

680
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:37,222
Were you not in London?
Have you not received my letters?

681
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:42,272
I had the pleasure of receiving
the information you sent to me.

682
01:21:44,322 --> 01:21:48,992
For heaven's sake, Willoughby,
tell me what is wrong.

683
01:21:51,282 --> 01:21:55,032
Thank you. I am most obliged.

684
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:59,872
Excuse me, I must rejoin my party.

685
01:22:19,812 --> 01:22:24,732
Go to him.
Force him to come to me instantly.

686
01:22:24,902 --> 01:22:28,942
You must come away.

687
01:22:30,322 --> 01:22:36,702
- Do you know them?
- Acquaintances from the country.

688
01:22:44,502 --> 01:22:48,712
Come away, dearest.

689
01:22:55,592 --> 01:23:00,472
I do not understand.
I must speak to him ...

690
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:05,442
My goodness. Come, dear.
You need some air.

691
01:23:17,912 --> 01:23:22,412
Lucy!
We must go.

692
01:23:22,582 --> 01:23:27,792
It would be your pleasure
to escort your young charge home.

693
01:23:27,962 --> 01:23:30,302
How kind.

694
01:23:30,462 --> 01:23:35,682
She actually sent him messages
during the night

695
01:23:46,402 --> 01:23:51,072
- Marianne, please tell me.
- Do not ask me questions.

696
01:23:51,232 --> 01:23:58,492
- You have no confidence in me.
- You confide in no one.

697
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:05,162
- I have nothing to tell.
- We neither of us do.

698
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:10,712
I, because I conceal nothing. You,
because you communicate nothing.

699
01:24:17,092 --> 01:24:22,562
Lady Charter is ought to limit her
invitation list. It was very warm.

700
01:24:22,722 --> 01:24:25,942
I am glad we left early.

701
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:30,692
There now ...

702
01:24:33,692 --> 01:24:40,032
Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal.
That letter will do the trick.

703
01:24:40,202 --> 01:24:47,002
I must be off. I do hope he doesn't
keep her waiting much longer.

704
01:24:47,162 --> 01:24:50,002
It hurts to see her this way.

705
01:24:52,502 --> 01:24:56,092
What a welcome I had
from Edward's family.

706
01:24:56,262 --> 01:25:02,812
You never said how agreeable
your sister-in-law is. Robert, also.

707
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:08,692
It is fortunate that none of them
knows of your engagement.

708
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:24,372
"'Dear Madam. I am at a loss to see
how I might have offended you."

709
01:25:24,542 --> 01:25:30,212
"lf I have given rise to a belief of
more than I meant to express, -

710
01:25:30,372 --> 01:25:34,252
- I regret
not having been more guarded."

711
01:25:34,422 --> 01:25:37,422
"My affections
are engaged elsewhere."

712
01:25:37,592 --> 01:25:43,472
"It is with regret that I return
your letters and the lock of hair."

713
01:25:43,642 --> 01:25:48,432
"l am, et cetera, John Willoughby."

714
01:25:50,522 --> 01:25:53,442
Dearest ...

715
01:25:55,362 --> 01:26:03,162
It is better than if your engagement
had carried on before he ended it.

716
01:26:03,322 --> 01:26:06,162
We're not engaged.

717
01:26:06,332 --> 01:26:11,212
I thought he left you
with some kind of understanding.

718
01:26:11,372 --> 01:26:18,462
- He's not so unworthy as you think.
- Did he tell you that he loved you?

719
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:27,352
Yes. No ... Never absolutely.
It was implied but never declared.

720
01:26:27,512 --> 01:26:32,602
Sometimes I thought it had been,
but it never was. He broke no vow.

721
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:37,402
He made us all believe he loved you.

722
01:26:37,572 --> 01:26:43,452
He did! He loved me as I loved him.

723
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:51,332
I had to come straight up.
How are you, Miss Marianne?

724
01:26:51,502 --> 01:26:56,292
Poor thing, she looks very bad.
No wonder. for it is but too true.

725
01:26:56,462 --> 01:27:00,012
I was told by Miss Morton, -

726
01:27:00,172 --> 01:27:04,802
- that he is soon to marry
a Miss Grey with 50,000!

727
01:27:05,802 --> 01:27:11,562
If true, he is a good-for-nothing
who used my young friend ill.

728
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:17,022
And I wish with all my soul that his
wife might plague all his heart out.

729
01:27:17,192 --> 01:27:22,282
He's not the only young man
worth having.

730
01:27:22,442 --> 01:27:26,702
With your pretty face
You'll never want for admirers.

731
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:34,752
Better let her have her cry out
and have done with it.

732
01:27:34,922 --> 01:27:39,502
I will go look out something
to tempt her.

733
01:27:39,672 --> 01:27:45,012
- Does she care for olives?
- I cannot tell you.

734
01:27:52,522 --> 01:27:55,482
Apparently, they never were engaged.

735
01:27:55,642 --> 01:28:00,112
Miss Grey has 50,000.
Marianne is virtually penniless.

736
01:28:00,272 --> 01:28:05,242
She couldn't expect him to go
through with it. But I feel for her.

737
01:28:05,402 --> 01:28:09,662
She will lose her bloom
and end a spinster like Elinor.

738
01:28:09,832 --> 01:28:16,922
We might have them to stay for a
few days. We are, after all, family.

739
01:28:17,082 --> 01:28:20,422
- And my father ...
- My love ...

740
01:28:20,592 --> 01:28:25,592
I would ask them with all my heart,
but I've already asked Miss Steele.

741
01:28:25,762 --> 01:28:29,932
And we cannot deprive Mrs. Jennings
of all her company.

742
01:28:30,102 --> 01:28:33,312
We can invite your sisters
some other year.

743
01:28:33,472 --> 01:28:38,812
Miss Steele will profit more
from your generosity, poor girl.

744
01:28:38,982 --> 01:28:41,902
Excellent notion.

745
01:28:45,952 --> 01:28:48,412
Colonel Brandon to see you.

746
01:28:49,072 --> 01:28:56,462
- Thank you so much for coming.
- How is your sister?

747
01:28:56,622 --> 01:29:03,752
I must get her home. Palmer can take
us to Cleveland, a day from Barton.

748
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:11,932
- I'll take you to Barton myself.
- I confess, that is what I hoped.

749
01:29:12,102 --> 01:29:15,852
Marianne suffers cruelly.

750
01:29:16,022 --> 01:29:23,272
What pains me most is how hard
she tries to justify Mr. Willoughby.

751
01:29:26,572 --> 01:29:30,112
Perhaps ...

752
01:29:31,492 --> 01:29:37,582
Ma I relate some circumstances
which only a desire to be useful ...

753
01:29:37,752 --> 01:29:42,082
You have something to tell me
of Mr. Willoughby?

754
01:29:51,392 --> 01:29:55,182
When I quitted Barton last ...

755
01:29:55,352 --> 01:29:59,182
No, I must go further back.

756
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:04,152
No doubt ...
No doubt ...

757
01:30:04,322 --> 01:30:08,942
... Mrs. Jennings has appraised you
of certain events in my past.

758
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:15,372
The sad outcome of my connection
with a young woman named Eliza.

759
01:30:17,372 --> 01:30:21,292
What is not commonly known -

760
01:30:21,462 --> 01:30:27,502
- is that 20 years ago,
before she died. Eliza bore a child.

761
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:31,802
The father. whoever he was.
abandoned them.

762
01:30:31,972 --> 01:30:38,102
As Eliza lay dying, she begged me
to look after the child.

763
01:30:38,272 --> 01:30:43,732
I had failed her in ever other way,
I could not refuse her now.

764
01:30:43,902 --> 01:30:49,112
I placed the child, Beth,
with a family in the country -

765
01:30:49,282 --> 01:30:54,742
- where I knew she would be looked
after. I saw her whenever I could.

766
01:30:54,912 --> 01:30:58,332
She grew up so headstrong, -

767
01:30:58,492 --> 01:31:04,922
- and, God forgive me,
I allowed her too much freedom.

768
01:31:05,082 --> 01:31:08,422
Almost a year ago she disappeared.

769
01:31:08,592 --> 01:31:13,302
I instigated a search, but for
eight months I imagined the worst.

770
01:31:13,472 --> 01:31:19,182
On the day of the Delaford picnic,
I received the first news of her.

771
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:24,692
She was ... with child.

772
01:31:24,852 --> 01:31:30,692
And the blackguard who had left her
with no hint of his whereabouts ...

773
01:31:36,912 --> 01:31:40,952
Do you mean Willoughby?

774
01:31:42,832 --> 01:31:48,712
Before I could confront him.
Lady Allen had turned him out.

775
01:31:48,882 --> 01:31:53,632
- He fled to London.
- He left without any explanation.

776
01:31:53,802 --> 01:32:01,222
He risked losing the estate, and the
money that remained to his debtors.

777
01:32:01,392 --> 01:32:05,602
So he abandoned Marianne -

778
01:32:05,772 --> 01:32:10,322
- for Miss Grey
and her 50.000.

779
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:15,532
Is Beth still in town?

780
01:32:16,202 --> 01:32:20,412
She has chosen to go to the country
for her confinement.

781
01:32:27,502 --> 01:32:32,382
I would not burden you,
had I not, from my heart, -

782
01:32:32,552 --> 01:32:37,762
- believed it might, in time,
lessen our sister's regrets.

783
01:32:47,692 --> 01:32:53,862
I have described Mr. Willoughby
as the worst of libertines.

784
01:32:54,032 --> 01:32:59,492
But I learned from Lady Allen that
he did mean to propose that day.

785
01:32:59,662 --> 01:33:07,412
I cannot deny that his intentions
towards Marianne were honourable.

786
01:33:09,332 --> 01:33:14,632
I feel certain
that he would have married her.

787
01:33:14,802 --> 01:33:18,842
- Had it not been ...
- For the money.

788
01:33:24,392 --> 01:33:29,602
- Was I right to tell you?
- Of course.

789
01:33:31,942 --> 01:33:36,692
Whatever his past actions,
whatever his present course, -

790
01:33:36,862 --> 01:33:41,532
- you may be certain
that he loved you.

791
01:33:41,702 --> 01:33:45,162
But not enough.

792
01:33:45,332 --> 01:33:48,502
Not enough ...

793
01:33:56,462 --> 01:34:00,182
Here is someone to cheer you up.

794
01:34:02,802 --> 01:34:09,182
How is your dear sister?
Poor thing.

795
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:14,362
I do not know what I'd do if a man
treated me with so little respect.

796
01:34:14,522 --> 01:34:18,152
Are you enjoying your stay
with John and Fanny?

797
01:34:18,322 --> 01:34:24,492
I was never so happy in my life.
Your sister-in-law has taken to me.

798
01:34:24,662 --> 01:34:29,662
- You cannot imagine what happened.
- No. I cannot.

799
01:34:29,832 --> 01:34:37,212
Yesterday I was introduced to his
mother. She was more than civil.

800
01:34:37,382 --> 01:34:43,222
I have not yet seen Edward,
but I feel sure to, very soon.

801
01:34:46,182 --> 01:34:50,942
There is a Mr. Edward Ferrars
to see you.

802
01:34:54,652 --> 01:34:57,822
Do ask him to come in.

803
01:35:33,602 --> 01:35:39,572
What a pleasure to see you.
You know Miss Steele. of course.

804
01:35:43,952 --> 01:35:51,002
- How do you do, Miss Steele?
- I am well, thank you.

805
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:56,672
Do sit down.

806
01:36:01,262 --> 01:36:07,142
Are you surprised to find me here
and not at your sister's house?

807
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:14,062
Let me fetch Marianne. She would be
disappointed to miss you.

808
01:36:15,272 --> 01:36:19,112
Edward! I heard your voice.

809
01:36:19,272 --> 01:36:25,652
- At last you found us.
- My visit is shamefully overdue.

810
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:31,872
- You're pale. Are you not well?
- Don't think of me. Elinor is well.

811
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:38,462
- That is enough for both of us.
- How do you enjoy London?

812
01:36:38,632 --> 01:36:45,552
The sight of you is all the pleasure
it has afforded. Is that not so?

813
01:36:47,222 --> 01:36:52,352
- Why have you not visited before?
- I have been engaged elsewhere.

814
01:36:52,512 --> 01:36:57,272
But what was that when there were
such friends to be met?

815
01:36:57,442 --> 01:37:02,362
Perhaps you think young men
never honour their engagements

816
01:37:02,522 --> 01:37:07,662
Edward is the most incapable of
being selfish of anyone I ever saw.

817
01:37:10,532 --> 01:37:17,252
Edward, will you not sit?
Help me to persuade him.

818
01:37:24,882 --> 01:37:30,222
- Forgive me. I must take m leave.
- You are only just arrived.

819
01:37:30,392 --> 01:37:33,682
I've an urgent commission for Fanny.

820
01:37:33,852 --> 01:37:37,982
Perhaps you might escort me
back to your sister's house.

821
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:44,862
It would be an honour.

822
01:38:03,422 --> 01:38:09,682
- Why did you not urge him to stay?
- He must have had his reasons.

823
01:38:09,842 --> 01:38:16,932
Yes, your coldness. Were I Edward,
I'd assume you didn't care for me.

824
01:38:20,482 --> 01:38:27,192
Marianne looked badly. It makes me
fear that I shall never marry.

825
01:38:27,362 --> 01:38:32,242
Nonsense. You will marry far better
than the Dashwood girls.

826
01:38:32,412 --> 01:38:35,662
But I have no dowry.

827
01:38:35,832 --> 01:38:41,462
There are other important qualities
that you have in abundance.

828
01:38:41,622 --> 01:38:47,002
It would not surprise me if you
married beyond your expectations.

829
01:38:47,172 --> 01:38:51,182
Oh, I wish that might be so.

830
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:55,512
There is a young man ...

831
01:38:55,682 --> 01:38:59,852
Is he of good fortune and breeding?

832
01:39:00,022 --> 01:39:05,772
Of both. But his family
would certainly oppose the match.

833
01:39:05,942 --> 01:39:10,652
They will allow it
as soon as they see you.

834
01:39:10,822 --> 01:39:13,662
It is a very great secret.

835
01:39:13,822 --> 01:39:18,952
I've told nobody in the world
for fear of discovery.

836
01:39:19,122 --> 01:39:25,462
- I am the soul of discretion.
- If I dared tell ...

837
01:39:27,172 --> 01:39:32,552
I can assure you,
I am as silent as the grave.

838
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:43,392
Viper in my bosom!

839
01:39:45,942 --> 01:39:49,732
Stop this!

840
01:40:04,712 --> 01:40:11,802
What a commotion! Edward Ferrars.
the one I used to joke you about, -

841
01:40:11,962 --> 01:40:17,142
- is engaged these five years
to Lucy Steele.

842
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:25,062
His mother has demanded he break the
engagement or suffer disinheritance.

843
01:40:25,232 --> 01:40:30,572
But he refuses to break his promise.
He has stood by her, -

844
01:40:30,732 --> 01:40:36,782
- and is cut off without a penny.
She settled it all on Mr. Robert.

845
01:40:36,952 --> 01:40:43,662
I must find Lucy. Your sister-in-law
drove her to hysteria.

846
01:40:45,502 --> 01:40:49,592
How long have you known?

847
01:40:51,802 --> 01:40:57,132
- Since Mrs. Jennings invited us.
- Why did you not tell me?

848
01:40:57,302 --> 01:41:00,512
Lucy told me in confidence.

849
01:41:00,682 --> 01:41:04,602
- I could not break my word.
- He loves you!

850
01:41:04,772 --> 01:41:10,022
- He tried to tell me about Lucy.
- He cannot marry her.

851
01:41:11,402 --> 01:41:15,992
Should he treat her worse
than Willoughby treated you?

852
01:41:16,152 --> 01:41:22,742
- He can't marry without love.
- He promised a long time ago.

853
01:41:22,912 --> 01:41:31,502
He may harbour some regret, but he
he will be happy he kept his word.

854
01:41:31,672 --> 01:41:40,012
It is bewitching to think one's
happiness depends on one person, -

855
01:41:40,182 --> 01:41:44,852
- but it is not always possible.
We must accept.

856
01:41:45,022 --> 01:41:50,522
Edward will marry Lucy,
and you and I will go home.

857
01:41:50,692 --> 01:41:53,652
Always resignation and acceptance.

858
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:58,032
Always prudence and honour and duty.

859
01:41:58,202 --> 01:42:01,702
Elinor, where is your heart?

860
01:42:02,372 --> 01:42:06,872
What do you know of my heart,
or anything but your own suffering?

861
01:42:07,042 --> 01:42:12,212
For weeks this has been pressed
on me, when I could not speak of it.

862
01:42:12,382 --> 01:42:19,382
Forced on me by the person whose
prior claims ruined all my hopes.

863
01:42:19,552 --> 01:42:24,512
I endured her exaltation, knowing
I was divided from Edward forever.

864
01:42:24,682 --> 01:42:30,392
If not bound to silence. I'd have
produced proof of a broken heart.

865
01:42:57,632 --> 01:43:05,142
I have heard your Mr. Ferrars
has lost his fortune to his brother.

866
01:43:05,302 --> 01:43:10,812
- Have I been rightly informed?
- It is indeed so.

867
01:43:10,982 --> 01:43:18,532
- Are you acquainted with him?
- No. we have never met.

868
01:43:18,692 --> 01:43:23,572
But I know only too well
the cruelty ...

869
01:43:23,742 --> 01:43:30,002
... of dividing two young people
long attached to one another.

870
01:43:32,712 --> 01:43:38,712
I have a proposal that may allow him
to marry Miss Steele immediately.

871
01:43:38,882 --> 01:43:43,682
As he is a friend to your family,
perhaps you'd mention it to him.

872
01:43:46,052 --> 01:43:52,812
I'm sure he'd be delighted
to hear it from your own lips.

873
01:43:54,442 --> 01:43:57,482
I think not.

874
01:43:57,652 --> 01:44:04,202
His behaviour has proved him proud.
In the best sense.

875
01:44:04,362 --> 01:44:08,412
I feel certain
this is the right course.

876
01:44:15,172 --> 01:44:18,382
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

877
01:44:28,182 --> 01:44:31,312
Thank you for responding so quickly.

878
01:44:31,472 --> 01:44:35,442
I was grateful
to receive your message.

879
01:44:35,602 --> 01:44:38,732
God knows what you must think of me.

880
01:44:38,902 --> 01:44:43,902
- I have no right to speak...
- I have good news.

881
01:44:44,072 --> 01:44:47,072
Do please sit down.

882
01:44:51,992 --> 01:44:57,422
- You know of Col. Brandon.
- I've heard his name.

883
01:44:57,582 --> 01:45:03,712
Col. Brandon desires me to say,
as you wish to join the clergy, -

884
01:45:03,882 --> 01:45:09,722
- that he has pleasure in offering
you the parish at Delaford, -

885
01:45:09,892 --> 01:45:14,312
- in the hope it may enable
you and Miss Steele to marry.

886
01:45:15,682 --> 01:45:19,272
- Col. Brandon!
- Yes.

887
01:45:19,442 --> 01:45:26,282
He means it as testimony of his
concern for this cruel situation.

888
01:45:27,822 --> 01:45:31,372
Col. Brandon give me a parish!

889
01:45:32,452 --> 01:45:36,122
Can it be possible?

890
01:45:36,292 --> 01:45:42,962
You shouldn't be astonished to find
friendship outside your family.

891
01:45:43,132 --> 01:45:48,842
No.
Not to find it in you.

892
01:45:49,012 --> 01:45:54,102
I cannot be ignorant that it is
certainly to you that I owe this.

893
01:45:54,272 --> 01:45:58,352
I'd express it if I could,
but I am no orator ...

894
01:45:58,522 --> 01:46:04,652
You are mistaken.
You owe it to your own merit.

895
01:46:09,072 --> 01:46:13,452
Col. Brandon must be a man
of great worth.

896
01:46:13,622 --> 01:46:18,082
He is the kindest and best of men.

897
01:46:20,122 --> 01:46:25,592
May I ask why the colonel
did not tell me himself?

898
01:46:25,752 --> 01:46:31,472
I think he felt it would be better
coming from a friend.

899
01:46:35,892 --> 01:46:41,352
Your friendship has been
the most important in my life.

900
01:46:44,732 --> 01:46:48,402
You will always have it.

901
01:46:52,202 --> 01:46:55,532
Forgive me.

902
01:46:55,702 --> 01:47:00,962
You honour your promises. That is
more important than anything else.

903
01:47:01,122 --> 01:47:05,592
I wish you both happiness.

904
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:49,422
What luck for them
to find a parish so close to Barton.

905
01:47:49,592 --> 01:47:53,842
You'll all be able to meet
very often.

906
01:47:54,012 --> 01:47:58,932
I've never disliked a person so much
as I do Mr. Willoughby.

907
01:47:59,102 --> 01:48:06,612
We can see his house from the hill!
I'll ask Jackson to plant trees.

908
01:48:06,772 --> 01:48:08,902
You won't.

909
01:48:09,072 --> 01:48:13,992
I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown
was everything of the finest ...

910
01:48:25,922 --> 01:48:31,802
Mrs. Bunting!
We're in desperate need of tea.

911
01:48:39,222 --> 01:48:44,142
She's not drawn breath since London.
Had I only found another way home.

912
01:48:44,312 --> 01:48:50,862
There was no other way. I'll just
take a stroll. A moment's peace.

913
01:48:51,032 --> 01:48:55,742
- I think it is going to rain.
- No. it will not rain.

914
01:48:55,912 --> 01:49:01,952
- When you say so, it always does.
- I shall keep to the garden.

915
01:49:21,642 --> 01:49:30,902
We are very proud of your Thomas.
His papa has such a way with him.

916
01:49:42,582 --> 01:49:48,122
Oh, there you are.
Come and meet little Thomas.

917
01:50:03,722 --> 01:50:07,182
I cannot see Marianne.

918
01:50:45,432 --> 01:50:52,352
Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds. -

919
01:50:52,522 --> 01:50:57,902
- or bends with the remover
to remove.

920
01:50:58,072 --> 01:51:03,282
Oh. no. It is an ever fixed mark -

921
01:51:03,452 --> 01:51:08,202
- that looks on tempests
and is never shaken.

922
01:51:10,372 --> 01:51:13,422
Willoughby ...

923
01:51:14,882 --> 01:51:17,962
Willoughby ...

924
01:51:18,132 --> 01:51:21,222
Willoughby ...

925
01:51:25,052 --> 01:51:27,142
Marianne!

926
01:51:27,312 --> 01:51:34,022
- She'll be wet through.
- Thank you for pointing that out.

927
01:51:34,192 --> 01:51:38,112
Do not worry, Miss Dashwood.
Brandon will find her.

928
01:51:38,282 --> 01:51:43,112
We can all guess where she went.

929
01:52:11,932 --> 01:52:16,022
She's not hurt.
but we must get her warm.

930
01:52:16,192 --> 01:52:21,322
There is a fire lit in my room.
Do hurry!

931
01:52:48,932 --> 01:52:52,982
I think Marianne may need
a doctor.

932
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:19,252
You'll wear yourself out. A day or
two in bed will set her to rights.

933
01:53:19,422 --> 01:53:25,882
You can rely upon Harris, Colonel.
I've never found a better physician.

934
01:53:26,052 --> 01:53:33,352
- What is the diagnosis?
- It is an infectious fever.

935
01:53:33,522 --> 01:53:39,612
- I recommend removing your child.
- Mrs. Bunting!

936
01:53:47,742 --> 01:53:53,412
Miss Dashwood ...
I am more sorry than I can say.

937
01:53:53,582 --> 01:53:59,382
- If you prefer me to stay I shall.
- That is very kind.

938
01:53:59,542 --> 01:54:03,842
But Col. Brandon and Dr. Harris
will look after us.

939
01:54:04,002 --> 01:54:07,422
Thank you for all you have done.

940
01:54:35,622 --> 01:54:40,122
She's not doing as well
as I would like.

941
01:54:53,642 --> 01:54:56,892
What can I do?

942
01:54:58,312 --> 01:55:04,732
- You've done so much already.
- Anything, or I shall run mad.

943
01:55:04,902 --> 01:55:09,322
She would be easier
if her mother were here.

944
01:55:53,362 --> 01:55:56,492
I must fetch more laudanum.

945
01:55:56,662 --> 01:56:03,422
I cannot pretend that your sister's
condition is not very serious.

946
01:56:07,922 --> 01:56:11,262
You must prepare yourself.

947
01:56:11,422 --> 01:56:15,092
I will return shortly.

948
01:56:31,572 --> 01:56:34,242
Marianne ...

949
01:56:34,412 --> 01:56:37,872
Marianne, please try ...

950
01:56:39,792 --> 01:56:42,412
Marianne ...

951
01:56:44,622 --> 01:56:48,752
Please try ...

952
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:04,732
I cannot ...
I cannot do without you.

953
01:57:12,482 --> 01:57:18,162
I've tried to bear everything else.
I will try ...

954
01:57:19,372 --> 01:57:23,252
But please, dearest ...

955
01:57:27,212 --> 01:57:30,172
... beloved Marianne ...

956
01:57:33,882 --> 01:57:37,892
... do not leave me alone.

957
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:34,692
Elinor ...

958
01:59:00,262 --> 01:59:02,342
My mother ...

959
01:59:11,812 --> 01:59:16,482
She is out of danger.
She is out of danger.

960
01:59:29,082 --> 01:59:32,372
- Where is Elinor?
- I'm here.

961
01:59:32,542 --> 01:59:35,792
Dearest. I am here.

962
01:59:40,012 --> 01:59:43,512
Col. Brandon ...

963
01:59:50,182 --> 01:59:54,102
Thank you.

964
02:00:34,812 --> 02:00:41,402
He's not so dashing as Willoughby,
but he has a pleasing countenance.

965
02:00:41,572 --> 02:00:47,492
There was something in Willoughby's
eyes at times that I did not like.

966
02:00:51,702 --> 02:00:55,422
"Nor is the earth the lesse.
or loseth aught."

967
02:00:55,582 --> 02:01:03,592
"What from one place doth fall is
with the tide to another brought."

968
02:01:03,762 --> 02:01:10,392
"For there is nothing lost
but may be found ...

969
02:01:10,562 --> 02:01:14,602
... if sought."

970
02:01:17,652 --> 02:01:22,822
- Shall we continue tomorrow?
- No, for I must away.

971
02:01:22,992 --> 02:01:29,282
- Away! Where?
- That I cannot tell you.

972
02:01:29,452 --> 02:01:33,202
It is a secret.

973
02:01:35,332 --> 02:01:39,542
You will not stay away long

974
02:01:55,682 --> 02:01:58,692
There.

975
02:01:59,772 --> 02:02:05,402
There I fell.
and there I first saw Willoughby.

976
02:02:05,572 --> 02:02:10,622
Poor Willoughby.
He will always regret you.

977
02:02:10,782 --> 02:02:16,412
Does it follow that. had he chosen
me he would have been content

978
02:02:16,582 --> 02:02:21,132
He would have had a wife he loved.
but no money, -

979
02:02:21,292 --> 02:02:28,262
- and might have learned to rank
his Pocketbook above his heart.

980
02:02:31,222 --> 02:02:36,892
If his regrets are half as painful
as mine, he will suffer enough.

981
02:02:37,062 --> 02:02:42,982
Do you compare
your conduct with his?

982
02:02:43,152 --> 02:02:49,612
I compare it to what it
ought to have been. With yours.

983
02:03:02,542 --> 02:03:06,052
I fetched those beef fillets. Ma'am.

984
02:03:06,212 --> 02:03:12,342
Beef is less expensive in Exeter.
Anyway, it's for Marianne.

985
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:16,392
- Was Exeter crowded?
- It was. Ma'am.

986
02:03:16,562 --> 02:03:22,272
Miss Pothington
has had another stroke.

987
02:03:22,442 --> 02:03:26,612
And Miss Murden has turned away
Coles for his drunkenness.

988
02:03:26,782 --> 02:03:32,322
And Mr. Ferrars is married.
but of course you know that.

989
02:03:35,372 --> 02:03:38,372
Who told you he was married?

990
02:03:38,542 --> 02:03:46,302
I saw Mrs. Ferrars myself. She and
Mr. Ferrars stopped at the inn.

991
02:03:46,462 --> 02:03:51,052
I saw it was Miss Steele.
so I took off my hat.

992
02:03:51,222 --> 02:03:56,012
She inquired after all of you,
especially Miss Dashwood.

993
02:03:56,182 --> 02:04:04,152
She bade me give their compliments.
They're sending a piece of the cake.

994
02:04:05,402 --> 02:04:10,952
- Did Mrs. Ferrars seem well?
- She said she was vastly contented.

995
02:04:11,112 --> 02:04:16,282
As she was always an affable lady,
I made free to wish her joy.

996
02:04:16,452 --> 02:04:19,792
Thank you, Thomas.

997
02:04:50,822 --> 02:04:55,162
- What is it. Thomas!
- I'm not sure, but it's heavy.

998
02:04:55,862 --> 02:05:01,832
"It is small enough for the parlour.
When I follow shortly, I expect -

999
02:05:02,002 --> 02:05:07,672
- that you've learnt the enclosed.
Your friend, Christopher Brandon."

1000
02:05:07,842 --> 02:05:11,382
It fits perfectly.

1001
02:05:11,712 --> 02:05:14,882
Here you are, Miss Marianne.

1002
02:05:15,052 --> 02:05:17,802
Fetch some tea.

1003
02:05:17,972 --> 02:05:24,442
- He must like you very much.
- It's for all of us.

1004
02:06:12,192 --> 02:06:15,442
Here is Col. Brandon.

1005
02:06:25,332 --> 02:06:32,212
- I do not think it is the colonel.
- He said he would arrive today.

1006
02:06:33,002 --> 02:06:35,842
Edward!

1007
02:06:36,012 --> 02:06:39,012
It is Edward!

1008
02:06:40,932 --> 02:06:44,682
Calm.
We must be calm.

1009
02:07:05,662 --> 02:07:08,582
Mr. Ferrars for you, ma'am.

1010
02:07:12,502 --> 02:07:16,922
Edward ...
What a pleasure to see you.

1011
02:07:33,982 --> 02:07:40,612
- I trust I find you all well
- Thank you. We are all very well.

1012
02:07:45,372 --> 02:07:50,752
We've been enjoying fine weather ...
Well. we have .

1013
02:07:52,042 --> 02:07:58,132
I'm glad to hear it.
The roads were very dry.

1014
02:08:01,882 --> 02:08:07,642
I wish you great joy, Edward.

1015
02:08:24,452 --> 02:08:29,252
I hope
you have left Mrs. Ferrars well.

1016
02:08:30,542 --> 02:08:34,962
Tolerably ... Thank you.

1017
02:08:38,632 --> 02:08:42,932
Is Mrs. Ferrars at the new Parish?

1018
02:08:43,092 --> 02:08:47,262
No ... my mother is in town.

1019
02:08:47,432 --> 02:08:51,102
I meant Mrs. Edward Ferrars.

1020
02:08:54,442 --> 02:08:58,522
You've not heard?

1021
02:09:00,612 --> 02:09:04,742
I think you mean my brother.
Mrs. Robert Ferrars.

1022
02:09:07,282 --> 02:09:11,502
- Mrs. Robert Ferrars?
- Yes.

1023
02:09:13,002 --> 02:09:19,132
I received a letter
from Miss Steele. -

1024
02:09:19,302 --> 02:09:26,142
- or Mrs. Ferrars, I should say,
communicating to me -

1025
02:09:26,302 --> 02:09:31,642
- the transfer of her affections
to my brother Robert.

1026
02:09:31,812 --> 02:09:36,402
It seems they were much
thrown together in London.

1027
02:09:36,562 --> 02:09:42,942
In view of my new circumstances
I felt it only right -

1028
02:09:43,112 --> 02:09:47,702
- that she be released
from our engagement.

1029
02:09:47,872 --> 02:09:52,912
At any rate, they were married
last week in Plymouth.

1030
02:09:58,172 --> 02:10:01,342
Then you ...

1031
02:10:02,962 --> 02:10:06,132
... are not married?

1032
02:10:06,302 --> 02:10:10,182
No.

1033
02:10:36,502 --> 02:10:42,422
Elinor ...
I met Lucy when I was very young.

1034
02:10:42,592 --> 02:10:49,182
Had I had a profession, I would not
have felt such an idle inclination.

1035
02:10:49,342 --> 02:10:56,102
At Norland, I convinced myself that
you felt only friendship for me, -

1036
02:10:56,272 --> 02:11:00,272
- and that it was my heart alone
that I was risking.

1037
02:11:00,442 --> 02:11:07,322
I have come with no expectations,
only to express, now I am able, -

1038
02:11:08,902 --> 02:11:14,872
- that my heart is,
and always will be ...

1039
02:11:16,622 --> 02:11:20,172
... yours.

1040
02:11:33,222 --> 02:11:39,142
- He's sitting next to her.
- What else?

1041
02:11:39,312 --> 02:11:42,152
Tell us!

1042
02:11:42,312 --> 02:11:46,232
He's kneeling down!
