1
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,810
3 billion human lives
ended on August 29th, 1 997.

2
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,015
The survivors of the nuclear fire
called the war Judgment Day.

3
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,372
They lived only
to face a new nightmare,

4
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,730
the war against the machines.

5
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,453
The computer which
controlled the machines, Skynet,

6
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,852
sent two terminators
back through time.

7
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,815
Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance:

8
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,051
John Connor. My son.

9
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,378
The first terminator was programmed
to strike at me,

10
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,538
in the year 1 984,
before John was born.

11
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,458
It failed.

12
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,568
The second was set to strike
at John himself,

13
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,618
when he was still a child.

14
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,339
As before, the Resistance
was able to send a lone warrior.

15
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,531
A protector for John.

16
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,698
It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.

17
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,772
I need your clothes, your boots,
and your motorcycle.

18
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,895
You forgot to say 'please'.

19
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,289
Take it.

20
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,613
You can't leave and take
the man's wheels, son.

21
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,811
Now get off before I put you down.

22
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,893
That's it, goddammit!

23
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,577
Art 31 David show me code 6

24
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,169
at the 6th street bridge in Santa Fé

25
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,291
on an electrical disturbance.

26
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,218
1 0-4, 31 David.

27
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,489
John! Get in there
and clean up that pigsty of yours.

28
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,209
Your foster-parents
are kinda dicks, huh?

29
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,054
I swear I've had it
with that goddamn kid.

30
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,729
Won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move!

31
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,215
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

32
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,254
Todd.
- What?

33
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,691
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

34
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,251
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on, I'll get right on it.

35
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,936
John! Come on get your ass inside,
do what your mother tells you!

36
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,336
She's not my mother, Todd !

37
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,332
This next patient is interesting.
Been following the case for years.

38
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,212
29-year-old female. . .

39
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,253
...diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

40
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,897
Depression, anxiety, violent
acting-out, delusions of persecution.

41
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,292
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

42
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,498
She believes in a machine
called a "terminator",

43
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,614
which looks human of course, was
sent back through time to kill her.

44
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,935
That's original!

45
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,815
And also that the father of her child
was a soldier,

46
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,375
sent back to protect her.
- No.

47
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,016
He was from the future too.
The year 2029,

48
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,450
if I remember correctly.

49
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,134
Here we are.

50
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,253
Morning, Sarah.

51
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,929
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

52
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,535
Fine, Sarah.

53
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,412
She stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.

54
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,135
Repeated escape attempts.

55
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,619
Let's move on, shall we?

56
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,372
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms.

57
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,618
See that she takes her Thorazine.
- I'll take care of it.

58
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,052
Time to take you meds, Connor.

59
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,459
You take it.

60
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,732
You gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

61
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,652
I'm not taking it.

62
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,892
I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble. . .

63
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,214
Yeah, zap her.

64
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,898
Last call, sugar.

65
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,178
Sweet dreams.

66
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,813
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

67
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,250
That's right.
What's he done now?

68
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,258
Could I speak with him, please?

69
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,655
Could if he was here.

70
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,613
He took off on his bike.
So he could be anywhere.

71
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,373
Do you have a photo of John?

72
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,888
Yeah, sure, hold on.

73
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,650
You gonna tell me
what this is about?

74
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,135
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

75
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,533
He's a good looking boy.

76
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,249
Mind if I keep this picture?
- No, go on.

77
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,735
There was a guy here
looking for him too.

78
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,251
Big guy on a bike. Has that
got something to do with this?

79
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,898
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

80
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,258
Thanks for your cooperation.

81
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,173
Please insert your stolen card now!

82
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,169
PIN number...

83
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,571
Hurry up,
this is taking too long!

84
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,339
Go baby, go baby...

85
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,216
Alright! PIN number. . .

86
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,250
Who did you learn this from?
- My mom.

87
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,417
My real mom, I mean.

88
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,978
Withdraw 300 bucks.
Come on, baby, come on. . .

89
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,054
It worked !

90
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,532
Easy money! Come on!

91
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,812
Yeah!
- Piece of cake!

92
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,249
That her?

93
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,855
Yes.

94
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,656
So she's pretty cool, huh?
- No, she's a complete psycho.

95
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,615
That's why she's up at Pescadero,
the mental institute.

96
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,575
Tried to blow up
the computer factory,

97
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,249
but got shot and arrested.
- Oh shit.

98
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,574
She's a total loser.

99
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,376
Come on,
let's go spend some money!

100
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,178
Sarah.

101
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,248
Sarah, wake up.

102
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,096
Kyle?

103
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,929
You're dead.

104
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,899
Where's our son, Sarah?

105
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,416
They took him away from me.

106
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,169
He's the target now.
- I know!

107
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,337
He's alone.
You have to protect him.

108
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,173
I know.

109
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,008
You tell me how I am supposed
to do that.

110
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,336
He doesn't even
believe me anymore.

111
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,572
I've lost him.

112
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,453
You're strong, Sarah.

113
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,890
Stronger than you ever thought.
- No.

114
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,930
On your feet, soldier!

115
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,014
I love you. I always will.

116
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,819
I need you.
- I'll always be with you.

117
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,137
Remember the message?

118
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,014
"The future is not set.

119
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,816
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves."

120
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,335
Stay with me.

121
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,014
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

122
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,819
Kyle, don't go!

123
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,009
Kyle!

124
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,333
It's like a giant strobe light,

125
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,972
burning right to my eyes.

126
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,889
Somehow I can still see.

127
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,814
Look,

128
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,539
we know the dream's the same
every night, why do we have to...

129
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,572
Please continue.

130
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,414
The children look like burnt paper,

131
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,572
black,

132
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,612
not moving.

133
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,334
Then the blast wave hits them...

134
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,858
...and they fly apart like leaves.

135
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,889
Dreams about the end of the world
are very common, Sarah.

136
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,699
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

137
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,019
I know the date it happens!
- I'm sure it feels real to you.

138
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,771
On August 29th, 1 997 it's going to
feel pretty fucking real to you too!

139
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,133
Anybody not wearing
two million sunblock

140
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,695
is gonna have
a real bad day, get it?

141
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,894
God, you think
you're safe and alive.

142
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,492
You're already dead. Everybody,
him, you, you're dead already!

143
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,089
This place,
everything you see, is gone.

144
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,292
You're the one living
in a fucking dream, Silberman!

145
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,258
Because I know it happens.

146
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,495
It happens!

147
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,574
I feel much better now.

148
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,698
Clearer.

149
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,212
Yes. Your attitude has been
much improved lately.

150
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,857
It has helped to have a goal,

151
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,856
something to look forward to.

152
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,375
And what is that?

153
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,568
You said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

154
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,331
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

155
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,576
and I could have visitors.

156
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,970
Well, it's been six months.

157
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,575
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

158
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,775
I see.

159
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,456
Let's go back
to what you were saying

160
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,696
about those terminator machines.

161
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,409
Now you think they don't exist?

162
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,091
They don't exist.
I know that now.

163
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,735
But you've told me
on many occasions

164
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,978
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

165
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,979
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

166
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,694
They would've found
something at the factory.

167
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,254
I see.

168
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,249
So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?

169
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,690
No, why would they?

170
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,408
Let's try a new position.
Right, there.

171
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,857
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

172
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,688
The neurons are all centered.

173
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,370
Maybe the inhibitors failed.

174
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,378
Mr. Dyson?

175
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,929
The materials team. . .

176
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,219
...is running another series
this afternoon, and you have to. . .

177
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,060
You have to sign it out.

178
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,659
Come on. I'll get it.

179
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,448
I know I haven't been here that long,
but I was wondering if you know...

180
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,695
Know what?

181
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,534
Well if you know,
where it came from.

182
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,573
I asked the same question once.
Know what they told me?

183
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,895
"Don't ask."

184
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,975
Hello, Mr. Dyson. - How's it going?
- Okay.

185
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,099
Insert key.

186
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,054
Left and three, two, one, turn.

187
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,010
How are wife and kids?
- Great, thanks.

188
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,417
So what do you think, Doctor?

189
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,218
I've shown improvement,
haven't l?

190
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,170
Well, Sarah, here's the problem:

191
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,012
I know how smart you are.

192
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,329
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

193
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,214
I don't think you believe
what you're telling me.

194
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,135
If I put you in minimum security
you'll just try to escape again.

195
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,850
You have to let me see my son.
Please.

196
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,138
Please.

197
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,899
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

198
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,055
If I could just make a phone call.
- I'm afraid not. Not for a while.

199
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,490
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board

200
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,816
that you stay here
for another six months.

201
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,331
You son of a bitch!

202
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,616
You don't know what you're doing!
- Straighten her now!

203
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,970
You don't know what you're doing!

204
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,977
Model citizen.

205
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,500
You just missed him.
He left fifteen minutes ago.

206
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,419
I think he said he was going to
the Galleria. - Yeah.

207
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,088
The Galleria?

208
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,814
I'll get some quarters.
I'll be back, alright?

209
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,809
Girls, do you know John Connor?
- No.

210
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,413
You know this guy?

211
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,978
No, I don't know him.

212
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,813
John.
- Not now.

213
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,619
There's this cop scoping for you,
check it out.

214
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,657
Split, man, just go.
- Yeah.

215
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,055
I think I saw the kid
you're looking for.

216
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,532
You're not supposed to be here!

217
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,375
Get down!

218
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,295
Come on!

219
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,175
Goddamn!

220
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,496
Okay, time out. Stop the bike!

221
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,493
Come on, stop the bike.

222
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,771
Don't take this the wrong way,
you're a terminator, right?

223
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,972
Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 1 01 .

224
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:58,171
Holy shit! You're really real!

225
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,848
You're like a machine underneath,
but sort of alive outside?

226
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,859
I'm a cybernetic organism.

227
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,370
Living tissue
over a metal endoskeleton.

228
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,339
This is intense.

229
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,534
Get a grip, John.

230
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,009
You're not here to kill me.
I figured that out for myself.

231
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,689
So what's the deal?

232
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,609
My mission is to protect you.

233
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,454
Yeah? Who sent you?

234
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,489
You did.

235
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,976
35 years from now
you reprogrammed me

236
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,376
to be your protector here,
in this time.

237
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,658
This is deep.

238
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,214
This other guy,
he's a terminator like you, right?

239
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,651
Not like me. A T-1 000.

240
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,215
Advanced prototype.

241
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,571
You mean more advanced
than you are?

242
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,055
Yes. A mimetic polyalloy.

243
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,648
What does that mean?

244
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,175
Liquid metal.

245
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,173
Where are we going?
- We have to get out of the city.

246
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,291
And avoid the authorities.

247
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,617
I gotta stop by my house
and pick up some stuff. - Negative.

248
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,937
The T-1 000 will definitely
try to reacquire you there.

249
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,132
You sure?
- I would.

250
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,613
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks

251
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,779
but I gotta warn them.

252
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,335
Shit! You got a quarter?

253
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,415
Hello?

254
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,815
Janelle? It's me.

255
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,058
John?
- Yeah.

256
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,378
Is everything alright?
- Sure.

257
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,892
Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

258
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,049
John, it's late. I was
beginning to worry about you.

259
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,890
If you hurry, we can have dinner
together. I'm making beef stew.

260
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,336
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

261
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,769
Where are you?

262
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,415
What's the goddamn dog
barking at?

263
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,014
Shut up,

264
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,654
you piece of shit!

265
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,055
The dog's barking.

266
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,092
Tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

267
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,733
Honey, it's late.

268
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,292
Could it already be there?

269
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,575
Are you okay?

270
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,449
I'm right here. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

271
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,575
What's the dog's name?
- Max.

272
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,530
Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfy?

273
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,811
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

274
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,489
Wolfy's fine, honey.

275
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,935
Where are you?

276
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,977
Your foster-parents are dead.

277
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,248
I need a minute here.

278
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,453
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

279
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,732
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

280
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,095
Can't be real!

281
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,178
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

282
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,052
Only objects of equal size.

283
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,530
Why not a bomb
or something to get me?

284
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,415
It can't form complex machines.
Guns, explosives have chemicals,

285
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,691
moving parts.
It doesn't work that way.

286
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,777
But it can form solid metal shapes.

287
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,369
Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

288
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,409
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

289
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,373
at the West Highland police station
in 1 984.

290
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,653
He killed 1 7 police officers
that night.

291
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,178
Men with families.

292
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,253
Children.

293
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,335
These were taken
at a mall in Reseda. Today.

294
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,457
Ms Connor, we know
you know who this guy is.

295
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,371
Look, I just sat here
and told you your son is missing,

296
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,528
that the foster-parents
have been murdered.

297
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,333
We know this guy's involved.

298
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,128
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

299
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,694
We're wasting our time.

300
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,179
Let's go.

301
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,499
Sorry, guys. She's just grown
more and more disconnected

302
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,498
from reality as time goes on.

303
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,130
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

304
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,613
If she clears at all and can give us
anything, I'll call you. - Sure.

305
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,616
Douglas, take her
back to her room, please. - Yes, sir.

306
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,058
Come on, let's go.

307
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,936
We spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

308
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,850
For a while she was
with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy,

309
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,289
running guns.

310
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,775
Then there were some other guys.

311
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,774
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from,

312
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,177
so she could teach me
how to be this great military leader.

313
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,689
Then she gets busted and it's like:

314
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,978
"Sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.
Didn't you know?"

315
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:38,210
Everything I've been brought up
to believe is all bullshit.

316
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,619
I hated her for that.

317
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,536
But everything she said was true.

318
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,453
She knew.

319
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,970
And nobody believed her.

320
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,217
Not even me.

321
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,896
We gotta get her out of there.
- Negative.

322
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,774
The T-1 000's highest
probability for success will be

323
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,290
to copy her and wait
for you to make contact.

324
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,298
Great. What happens to her?

325
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,128
The subject being copied
is terminated.

326
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,570
Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go now!

327
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,011
Negative.
It's not a priority.

328
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,655
Fuck you,
she's a priority to me!

329
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,658
Goddammit!
What's your problem?

330
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,969
Help!
- This does not help our mission!

331
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,369
Help me! Get this psycho off of me.

332
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,615
Let me go!

333
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,579
Why did you do that?

334
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,419
Because you told me to.

335
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,848
What?

336
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,298
You have to do what I say?

337
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,657
One of my mission parameters.

338
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,135
Prove it.

339
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,089
Stand on one foot.

340
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,255
Cool! My own terminator.

341
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,695
You okay, kid?

342
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,095
Take a hike, bozo.

343
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,772
Let's get out of here.
- What?

344
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,539
Fuck you, little dipshit.

345
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,292
Dipshit?

346
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,135
Put your leg down.

347
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,178
Did you call moi a dipshit?

348
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,939
Just trying to help this punk.

349
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,778
Grab this guy.

350
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,018
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douchebag?

351
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,099
Put the gun down! Now!

352
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,895
Get out of here!

353
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,772
Come on, let's split!

354
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,132
You were gonna kill that guy!

355
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,258
Of course. I'm a terminator.

356
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,692
Listen to me carefully, okay?

357
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,808
You're not
a terminator anymore. Alright?

358
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,215
You got that?

359
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,773
You just can't go round
killing people! - Why?

360
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,891
What do you mean "why"?
'Cause you can't!

361
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,979
Why?
- Because you just can't, okay?

362
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,012
Trust me on this.

363
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,858
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

364
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,013
And I order you to help me.

365
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:59,015
You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running kind of late.

366
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,977
They've been in there for an hour.
Hold on a second, I'll buzz you in.

367
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,610
Oh, here come your friends now.

368
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,579
Hey Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

369
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,819
How about a beer?
- Yeah, right.

370
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,737
I got a Full House.
- That's good.

371
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,057
Must be my lucky day.

372
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,855
Yeah, I think you're right
about number 24.

373
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,574
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

374
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,737
Same time?
- Yeah.

375
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,814
You broke my arm !

376
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,095
There's 21 5 bones
in the human body. That's one.

377
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,735
Now don't move!

378
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,619
What are you gonna do?

379
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,813
Why do we stop now?

380
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:51,691
You gotta promise
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

381
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,931
Right.
- Swear.

382
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,489
What?

383
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:59,819
Just put up your hand and say
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

384
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,769
I swear I will not kill anyone.
- Alright, let's go.

385
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,689
Visiting hours is 1 0 to 4.
Monday through Friday.

386
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,415
What are you doing?

387
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,977
You son of a bitch! You shot me!

388
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,055
He'll live.

389
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,215
Son of a bitch!

390
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,218
Let's all try to remain calm.
- Open it or he'll be dead!

391
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,491
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

392
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,691
Open the door!
- It ain't gonna happen.

393
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,248
Take it easy, Sarah.

394
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,050
It won't work, Sarah.
You're no killer.

395
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,137
You're already dead, Silberman.

396
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,258
Everybody here dies.
So don't fuck with me!

397
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,213
Open the door.

398
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,495
Back off!

399
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,732
Get back or I'll pump him
full of this shit, I swear!

400
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,815
Don't move!

401
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,255
Drop the shit!

402
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,735
Do it! Do it!

403
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,254
Get in the office!

404
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,292
On the floor! Face down! Not you!

405
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,854
Open the door!

406
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,340
On the floor! Hold it open!
Face the wall!

407
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,775
Get her!

408
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,213
Come on, open it!

409
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,495
Come on!

410
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,498
She just broke it off.
- Open it.

411
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,933
Let's go around, come on!
Move it!

412
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,375
No!

413
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,929
No!

414
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:16,775
Mom! Wait!

415
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,295
No!

416
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,299
Help her.
- Wait here.

417
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,052
He'll kill us all!

418
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,055
He'll kill us all!

419
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,495
Mom, are you okay?

420
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,051
Come with me,
if you want to live.

421
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:11,019
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

422
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,019
Go!

423
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,651
What the fuck is going on?

424
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,929
Get down!

425
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:00,615
Out of the car!

426
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,175
Right now!

427
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:39,575
I'm out.

428
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,738
Come on!
- Here.

429
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,615
Reload !

430
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,419
Next one.

431
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:10,895
Hang on!

432
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,768
Ready!

433
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:52,815
Here, drive!

434
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,256
There's nobody behind us.

435
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,973
Are you alright?
- Yeah.

436
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:52,093
Can you even see anything?

437
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,575
I see everything.

438
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:57,615
Cool.

439
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:02,775
Come here.

440
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,652
I said I was okay.

441
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,168
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

442
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,571
You have to
be smarter than that.

443
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:21,853
You almost got yourself killed.
What were you thinking?

444
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:26,853
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me, do you understand?

445
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,209
You're too important!

446
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:30,539
You understand?

447
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:39,857
I had to get you
out of that place. I'm sorry.

448
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:44,736
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

449
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,855
What's wrong with your eyes?

450
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:54,855
Nothing.

451
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,539
So what's your story?

452
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,650
You okay?
- Fine.

453
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:24,458
Say, that's a nice bike.

454
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,658
Hey, watch it, lug nuts.

455
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:58,491
Listen,
you know what you are doing?

456
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,014
I have detailed files

457
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,372
on human anatomy.
- I bet.

458
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:07,775
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right? - Correct.

459
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,573
Does it hurt when you get shot?

460
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:21,329
I sense injuries. The data
could be called pain.

461
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,051
John, help me with the light.

462
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,376
Will these heal up?
- Yes.

463
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:30,369
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

464
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,777
How long do you live,
I mean "Iast", whatever?

465
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,250
1 20 years with
my existing power cell.

466
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:39,532
Can you learn stuff you
haven't been programmed with?

467
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:44,257
So you can be. . .
you know, more human?

468
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,531
Not such a dork all the time?

469
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:53,809
My CPU is a neural-net processor,
a learning computer,

470
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:57,616
that Skynet presets to READ
only when we are sent out alone.

471
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,774
Doesn't want you
to do too much thinking.

472
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,015
No.

473
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,212
Can we reset the switch?

474
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:28,059
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

475
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:34,895
Do it.

476
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,896
Now open the port cover.

477
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:51,018
Pull to break the seal.

478
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:57,733
Good, now remove
the shock damping assembly.

479
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,930
You can now access the CPU.

480
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,732
Do you see it?
- Yes.

481
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,375
Pull the CPU by its base tap.

482
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:10,975
Pull.

483
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:48,653
Can you see the pin switch?

484
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,379
No!

485
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,889
Out of my way, John!
- Don't kill him!

486
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,971
"It", John, not "him".

487
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:00,570
Okay, "it". But we need "it".

488
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:03,249
Listen to me. Listen.

489
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,337
We're better off on our own.

490
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,533
He's the only proof of
the future, the war and that.

491
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:10,895
Maybe.

492
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,299
I don't trust it.

493
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:18,015
But he's my friend, alright?

494
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,814
You don't know what it's like
to kill these things.

495
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:24,012
If something goes wrong,
this could be our last chance.

496
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,689
If I'm supposed to
be this military leader,

497
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:29,938
maybe you start listening
to my ideas once in a while.

498
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:36,729
'Cause if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

499
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,809
Alright, play it your way.

500
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,698
Was there a problem?

501
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:05,257
No problem.

502
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,255
None whatsoever.

503
01:10:40,065 --> 01:10:42,533
Are we learning yet?

504
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:56,981
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

505
01:11:00,225 --> 01:11:02,739
Just head south.

506
01:11:10,105 --> 01:11:12,858
Keep it under 65.
We don't want to be pulled over.

507
01:11:13,145 --> 01:11:14,180
Affirmative.

508
01:11:15,185 --> 01:11:16,698
No, no, no.

509
01:11:17,345 --> 01:11:19,575
You got to listen to
the way people talk.

510
01:11:19,905 --> 01:11:23,295
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

511
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:25,422
You say "No problemo".

512
01:11:25,945 --> 01:11:29,255
If someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say "Eat me".

513
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:33,413
And if you want to shine them
on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".

514
01:11:34,345 --> 01:11:36,495
Hasta la vista, baby.

515
01:11:37,145 --> 01:11:38,578
Or "Later, dickwad".

516
01:11:38,865 --> 01:11:41,584
If someone gets upset
you say "Chill out".

517
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:42,980
Or do combinations.

518
01:11:43,825 --> 01:11:45,895
Chill out, dickwad.

519
01:11:47,145 --> 01:11:48,498
You're getting it.

520
01:11:49,265 --> 01:11:50,493
No problemo.

521
01:12:01,105 --> 01:12:04,142
You got any cash?
- I got a couple of hundred bucks.

522
01:12:04,505 --> 01:12:05,620
I'll give you half.

523
01:12:06,145 --> 01:12:07,100
Mom!

524
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,258
Get some food.

525
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,297
No sense of humor.

526
01:12:20,105 --> 01:12:21,663
And that's another thing:

527
01:12:22,025 --> 01:12:23,174
Iighten up a bit.

528
01:12:24,425 --> 01:12:28,304
This severe routine is getting old.
You're acting like such a geek.

529
01:12:28,585 --> 01:12:29,938
Smile once in a while.

530
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:31,453
Smile?

531
01:12:31,825 --> 01:12:34,055
Yeah. You know, smile.

532
01:12:34,425 --> 01:12:35,380
Watch.

533
01:12:36,825 --> 01:12:39,737
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

534
01:12:40,905 --> 01:12:42,258
Gimme a break.

535
01:12:43,665 --> 01:12:46,099
Okay. Bad example.

536
01:12:47,105 --> 01:12:49,778
See that guy over there?
That's a smile.

537
01:13:09,265 --> 01:13:10,220
That's good.

538
01:13:10,505 --> 01:13:13,463
You could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

539
01:13:19,985 --> 01:13:22,101
Want some of my fries?

540
01:13:31,505 --> 01:13:32,904
Do you need any help?

541
01:13:33,265 --> 01:13:34,220
No.

542
01:13:34,985 --> 01:13:36,384
Got you!
- No, you didn't!

543
01:13:36,865 --> 01:13:38,014
Got you!
- You didn't!

544
01:13:44,705 --> 01:13:47,458
We're not gonna make it, are we?

545
01:13:49,505 --> 01:13:51,655
People, I mean.

546
01:13:53,825 --> 01:13:56,817
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

547
01:13:57,105 --> 01:13:59,619
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

548
01:14:04,305 --> 01:14:06,455
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

549
01:14:07,385 --> 01:14:08,738
Who's responsible?

550
01:14:09,025 --> 01:14:11,744
The man responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

551
01:14:12,745 --> 01:14:13,894
Who is that?

552
01:14:14,185 --> 01:14:18,098
The director of special projects at
Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

553
01:14:20,385 --> 01:14:21,454
Why him?

554
01:14:22,185 --> 01:14:25,973
In a few months he creates a
revolutionary microprocessor.

555
01:14:26,265 --> 01:14:27,254
Go on. Then what?

556
01:14:28,745 --> 01:14:31,817
In three years Cyberdyne
will become the largest supplier

557
01:14:32,105 --> 01:14:33,743
of military computer systems.

558
01:14:34,025 --> 01:14:37,097
Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers.

559
01:14:37,385 --> 01:14:38,420
Becoming unmanned,

560
01:14:38,705 --> 01:14:41,014
they fly
with a perfect operational record.

561
01:14:41,905 --> 01:14:43,702
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

562
01:14:43,985 --> 01:14:46,704
The system goes on-line
on August 4th, 1 997.

563
01:14:46,985 --> 01:14:50,136
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

564
01:14:50,425 --> 01:14:52,655
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

565
01:14:52,945 --> 01:14:56,699
It becomes self-aware at 2: 1 4 a.m.
eastern time, August 29.

566
01:14:57,945 --> 01:15:01,176
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

567
01:15:01,665 --> 01:15:03,337
Skynet fights back.

568
01:15:03,865 --> 01:15:07,175
Yes. It launches its missiles
against targets in Russia.

569
01:15:07,465 --> 01:15:09,183
Why Russia?
They're our friends now.

570
01:15:09,545 --> 01:15:12,582
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

571
01:15:12,865 --> 01:15:15,379
will eliminate its enemies here.
- Jesus.

572
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:21,024
How much do you know
about Dyson?

573
01:15:21,985 --> 01:15:24,545
I have detailed files.

574
01:15:24,825 --> 01:15:27,100
I want to know everything.

575
01:15:27,745 --> 01:15:31,260
What he looks like.
Where he lives. Everything.

576
01:15:43,185 --> 01:15:44,334
Miles!

577
01:16:05,665 --> 01:16:08,737
You going to work all day?
- I'm sorry, baby.

578
01:16:09,105 --> 01:16:10,857
This thing
is kicking my ass.

579
01:16:11,225 --> 01:16:14,900
It's Sunday. You promised to take
the kids to Raging Waters today.

580
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:19,822
I can't. I'm on a roll.

581
01:16:32,985 --> 01:16:36,216
This is gonna blow 'em away.
It's a neural-net processor.

582
01:16:36,505 --> 01:16:37,858
I know. You told me.

583
01:16:38,145 --> 01:16:40,739
It thinks and learns like we do.

584
01:16:41,105 --> 01:16:43,494
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

585
01:16:43,785 --> 01:16:47,539
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

586
01:16:49,785 --> 01:16:51,343
Why is that so important?

587
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:53,934
I need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like

588
01:16:54,305 --> 01:16:56,421
I'm going crazy here.

589
01:16:57,945 --> 01:16:59,742
Baby, I am this close.

590
01:17:00,785 --> 01:17:01,740
Come here.

591
01:17:04,025 --> 01:17:07,654
Imagine a jet airliner
with a pilot that never gets tired,

592
01:17:07,945 --> 01:17:10,937
never makes mistakes,
never shows up with a hangover.

593
01:17:13,385 --> 01:17:15,103
Meet the pilot.

594
01:17:15,705 --> 01:17:19,664
Why did we get married?
Have children? You don't need us.

595
01:17:20,185 --> 01:17:23,416
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

596
01:17:23,785 --> 01:17:25,821
But it doesn't love you like we do.

597
01:17:33,945 --> 01:17:36,220
I'm sorry. Really.

598
01:17:36,745 --> 01:17:40,374
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

599
01:17:43,265 --> 01:17:45,256
Raging Waters?
- Yeah!

600
01:18:13,625 --> 01:18:15,183
Wait in the car.

601
01:18:33,305 --> 01:18:34,818
Enrique?

602
01:18:35,185 --> 01:18:36,823
You here?

603
01:18:51,905 --> 01:18:53,304
Pretty jumpy, Connor.

604
01:18:55,225 --> 01:18:56,180
What about you?

605
01:18:59,305 --> 01:19:01,182
Always on the lurk.

606
01:19:03,585 --> 01:19:06,543
Good to see you, Connor.
- I promised to make it back.

607
01:19:06,905 --> 01:19:09,100
Man, I knew it.
Good to see you.

608
01:19:09,585 --> 01:19:13,578
Yolanda. Get out here, we got
company. And bring some tequila!

609
01:19:13,865 --> 01:19:15,014
Oye, Big John?

610
01:19:15,385 --> 01:19:16,579
Que pasa?
- What's up?

611
01:19:17,065 --> 01:19:19,021
Who's your friend?
- He's cool.

612
01:19:19,385 --> 01:19:23,378
He's with me. He is Uncle Bob.

613
01:19:23,745 --> 01:19:25,337
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

614
01:19:25,825 --> 01:19:27,656
Uncle Bob, huh?

615
01:19:28,705 --> 01:19:29,979
Okay.

616
01:19:31,905 --> 01:19:32,894
How are you?

617
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,380
How are you? You've gotten big.

618
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:38,097
Drink?

619
01:19:42,545 --> 01:19:43,500
Uncle Bob?

620
01:19:45,065 --> 01:19:46,817
Sarahlita, you pretty famous.

621
01:19:47,385 --> 01:19:50,695
All over the TV. Pictures of
you, John, your big friend here.

622
01:19:51,185 --> 01:19:53,335
Cops are going nuts looking for you.

623
01:19:54,265 --> 01:19:56,301
Take the kid, honey, will you?

624
01:19:56,665 --> 01:19:58,144
I just came for my stuff.

625
01:19:58,425 --> 01:20:00,985
I need clothes, food,
and one of your trucks.

626
01:20:01,345 --> 01:20:04,417
How about the fillings out of
my fucking teeth? - Now.

627
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:09,575
You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on, let's go.

628
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:32,055
One thing about my mom,

629
01:20:33,865 --> 01:20:35,901
she always plans ahead.

630
01:20:45,825 --> 01:20:46,780
Excellent.

631
01:20:51,425 --> 01:20:52,574
Nothing down here.

632
01:20:57,345 --> 01:21:00,894
This is the best truck I got,
but the starter is gone.

633
01:21:01,185 --> 01:21:03,415
You got the time to change it out?
- Yeah.

634
01:21:03,705 --> 01:21:06,139
I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

635
01:21:06,425 --> 01:21:09,258
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.

636
01:21:09,585 --> 01:21:12,053
You get out tonight too, okay?
- Sure.

637
01:21:13,545 --> 01:21:16,742
Just drop by any time
and totally fuck up my life.

638
01:21:22,145 --> 01:21:24,739
See, I grew up in places like this,

639
01:21:25,105 --> 01:21:27,619
so I thought
that's how people lived:

640
01:21:28,305 --> 01:21:31,377
riding around in helicopters,

641
01:21:31,945 --> 01:21:33,901
Iearning how to blow shit up.

642
01:21:35,705 --> 01:21:40,221
But then, when my mom got busted,
I got put in a regular school.

643
01:21:40,865 --> 01:21:43,902
The other kids were into Nintendo.

644
01:21:57,665 --> 01:21:59,337
Are you ever afraid?

645
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:00,819
No.

646
01:22:04,705 --> 01:22:05,854
Not even of dying?

647
01:22:07,145 --> 01:22:08,134
No.

648
01:22:12,985 --> 01:22:16,694
You don't feel any emotion about it
one way or another?

649
01:22:16,985 --> 01:22:19,453
No.
I have to stay functional

650
01:22:19,745 --> 01:22:21,656
until the mission is complete.

651
01:22:26,105 --> 01:22:27,936
Then it doesn't matter.

652
01:22:28,465 --> 01:22:31,821
Yeah. I have to stay functional too.
I'm "too important".

653
01:22:47,945 --> 01:22:49,298
That's definitely you.

654
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,898
Most of the guys my mom
hung round with were geeks.

655
01:23:03,465 --> 01:23:05,979
But there was this one guy.
He was kinda cool.

656
01:23:06,505 --> 01:23:08,735
He taught me engines.

657
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:10,299
Hold here.

658
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:13,053
Mom screwed it up, of course.

659
01:23:13,345 --> 01:23:16,178
She'd always tell
them about Judgment Day

660
01:23:16,465 --> 01:23:18,421
and me being this world leader.

661
01:23:18,705 --> 01:23:21,094
And that'll be all she wrote.

662
01:23:21,465 --> 01:23:25,697
Torque wrench, please.
- Here.

663
01:23:26,345 --> 01:23:29,337
I wish I could've met my real dad.

664
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:30,819
You will.

665
01:23:31,105 --> 01:23:32,618
Yeah. I guess.

666
01:23:33,025 --> 01:23:35,334
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

667
01:23:37,265 --> 01:23:40,337
I'll send him back
through time to 1 984.

668
01:23:43,425 --> 01:23:45,734
He hasn't even been born yet.

669
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:49,980
It messes with your head.

670
01:23:51,785 --> 01:23:53,423
The other bolt.

671
01:23:54,145 --> 01:23:55,100
Here.

672
01:24:01,825 --> 01:24:04,259
Mom and him
were only together one night.

673
01:24:04,585 --> 01:24:06,815
She still loves him, I guess.

674
01:24:07,265 --> 01:24:09,256
I see her crying sometimes.

675
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,456
She denies it totally, of course.

676
01:24:11,745 --> 01:24:14,259
Like she got something
stuck in her eye.

677
01:24:18,105 --> 01:24:19,333
Why do you cry?

678
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:22,138
You mean people?
- Yeah.

679
01:24:22,505 --> 01:24:23,654
I don't know.

680
01:24:23,945 --> 01:24:25,583
We just cry, you know.

681
01:24:26,105 --> 01:24:27,857
When it hurts.

682
01:24:34,025 --> 01:24:35,663
Pain causes it?

683
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:38,414
No, it's different.

684
01:24:38,705 --> 01:24:42,061
It's when there's nothing wrong
but you hurt anyway.

685
01:24:42,385 --> 01:24:43,454
You get it?
- No.

686
01:24:45,185 --> 01:24:46,140
Alright! My man!

687
01:24:46,905 --> 01:24:47,860
No problemo.

688
01:24:48,185 --> 01:24:49,140
Gimme five.

689
01:24:51,705 --> 01:24:53,900
Put out your hand like this.
Come on.

690
01:24:55,265 --> 01:24:56,698
Alright. Now hit me.

691
01:24:56,985 --> 01:25:00,500
Gimme five. Do the same thing.
- Alright!

692
01:25:03,705 --> 01:25:05,775
Okay, that's good.
Up high, up high.

693
01:25:06,985 --> 01:25:07,940
Five low.

694
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:09,580
Too slow.

695
01:25:12,825 --> 01:25:14,656
Just kidding.
One more time.

696
01:25:20,665 --> 01:25:24,624
Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.

697
01:25:25,105 --> 01:25:29,383
The Terminator would never stop,
it would never leave him,

698
01:25:30,345 --> 01:25:31,334
never hurt him,

699
01:25:31,705 --> 01:25:34,697
never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him,

700
01:25:34,985 --> 01:25:37,215
or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.

701
01:25:37,585 --> 01:25:40,053
It would always be there.

702
01:25:40,425 --> 01:25:42,734
And it would die to protect him.

703
01:25:44,425 --> 01:25:47,303
Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went,

704
01:25:47,665 --> 01:25:51,658
this thing, this machine,
was the only one who measured up.

705
01:25:52,705 --> 01:25:56,584
In an insane world,
it was the sanest choice.

706
01:29:21,305 --> 01:29:23,819
She said you go south with him.

707
01:29:24,145 --> 01:29:25,817
She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom !

708
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:28,424
Mom! Wait!

709
01:29:43,465 --> 01:29:44,420
"No fate."

710
01:29:46,945 --> 01:29:49,539
No fate but what we make.

711
01:29:50,465 --> 01:29:51,864
My father told her this.

712
01:29:54,945 --> 01:29:59,541
I mean, I made him memorize it, up
in the future, as a message to her.

713
01:30:00,345 --> 01:30:01,414
Never mind.

714
01:30:02,065 --> 01:30:03,293
Now okay,

715
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:07,744
the whole thing goes:
"The future is not set.

716
01:30:08,265 --> 01:30:11,462
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves."

717
01:30:11,825 --> 01:30:14,100
She intends to change the future.

718
01:30:14,585 --> 01:30:15,984
Yeah, I guess.

719
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:18,739
Oh shit!

720
01:30:19,105 --> 01:30:20,220
Dyson.

721
01:30:20,545 --> 01:30:22,536
Yeah, gotta be!

722
01:30:22,865 --> 01:30:24,617
Miles Dyson!

723
01:30:24,945 --> 01:30:26,424
She's gonna blow him away!

724
01:30:26,705 --> 01:30:28,058
Come on! Let's go!

725
01:30:40,785 --> 01:30:43,424
This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

726
01:30:43,785 --> 01:30:46,379
The T-1 000 has
the same files that I do.

727
01:30:46,665 --> 01:30:49,577
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

728
01:30:49,865 --> 01:30:51,742
I don't care. We've gotta stop her.

729
01:30:52,465 --> 01:30:56,299
Killing Dyson might actually
prevent the war. - I don't care!

730
01:30:56,585 --> 01:31:00,260
Haven't you learnt anything yet?
Why you can't kill people?

731
01:31:03,065 --> 01:31:05,704
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die.

732
01:31:05,985 --> 01:31:08,863
But everybody's not like that!
We have feelings.

733
01:31:09,145 --> 01:31:10,942
We hurt. We're afraid.

734
01:31:13,425 --> 01:31:17,464
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

735
01:31:52,745 --> 01:31:56,215
Danny, I told you
to go to bed like your sister.

736
01:31:56,505 --> 01:31:58,143
Just a couple of minutes, Mom.

737
01:32:14,865 --> 01:32:16,981
Danny, your time is up.

738
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:19,460
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

739
01:33:00,985 --> 01:33:01,940
Danny just go!

740
01:33:12,305 --> 01:33:13,260
Oh my God !

741
01:33:20,385 --> 01:33:22,023
Just take Danny and go. Run!

742
01:33:23,705 --> 01:33:25,058
Oh Jesus, Miles.

743
01:33:46,225 --> 01:33:47,817
Nobody fucking move!

744
01:33:48,505 --> 01:33:50,735
Don't hurt my daddy!
Get on the floor!

745
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:52,617
Fucking down! Now!

746
01:33:53,305 --> 01:33:54,784
Get out of the way!

747
01:33:55,145 --> 01:33:56,624
Don't hurt him!

748
01:33:56,905 --> 01:33:59,135
Get on the floor! Fast!

749
01:34:02,425 --> 01:34:04,256
Just let the boy go.

750
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:05,774
Shut up! Shut up!

751
01:34:07,505 --> 01:34:08,858
It's all your fault!

752
01:34:10,065 --> 01:34:11,896
It's all your fault!
- What?

753
01:34:12,465 --> 01:34:14,183
I'm not gonna let you do it.

754
01:35:04,345 --> 01:35:05,698
Shit, we're too late.

755
01:35:10,585 --> 01:35:11,574
Check them.

756
01:35:15,385 --> 01:35:18,582
Look at me, Mom.
Are you hurt?

757
01:35:19,385 --> 01:35:20,579
Look at me.

758
01:35:22,705 --> 01:35:24,536
I almost. . .

759
01:35:25,145 --> 01:35:27,101
I almost. . .

760
01:35:36,065 --> 01:35:40,104
It'll by okay.
We'll figure something out, okay?

761
01:35:41,545 --> 01:35:42,864
Promise.

762
01:35:46,665 --> 01:35:48,940
You came here to stop me?

763
01:35:50,105 --> 01:35:51,504
Yes, I did.

764
01:35:54,785 --> 01:35:56,184
I love you, John.

765
01:35:58,185 --> 01:36:00,858
I always have.

766
01:36:01,545 --> 01:36:02,978
I know.

767
01:36:10,025 --> 01:36:11,458
Clean penetration.

768
01:36:13,185 --> 01:36:14,823
No shattered bone.

769
01:36:15,185 --> 01:36:18,860
Hold here. Compression
should stop the bleeding.

770
01:36:28,385 --> 01:36:29,374
Who are you?

771
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:31,944
Show him.

772
01:36:34,705 --> 01:36:38,220
Danny, I want you to come with me.
Show me your room.

773
01:37:06,185 --> 01:37:08,460
Oh, my God !

774
01:37:18,825 --> 01:37:21,180
Now listen to me very carefully.

775
01:37:26,865 --> 01:37:30,574
Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.

776
01:37:30,985 --> 01:37:36,423
Skynet, Judgment Day,
the history of things to come.

777
01:37:38,225 --> 01:37:40,500
It's not every day that you find out

778
01:37:40,785 --> 01:37:43,618
you're responsible
for 3 billion deaths.

779
01:37:43,905 --> 01:37:46,339
He took it pretty well.

780
01:37:47,705 --> 01:37:49,661
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

781
01:37:56,185 --> 01:37:57,334
You're judging me

782
01:37:57,865 --> 01:38:00,743
on things I haven't even done yet.

783
01:38:04,145 --> 01:38:06,454
How were we
supposed to know?

784
01:38:08,945 --> 01:38:10,936
Yeah. Right.

785
01:38:12,505 --> 01:38:15,258
How were you supposed to know?

786
01:38:15,825 --> 01:38:19,022
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

787
01:38:19,785 --> 01:38:23,744
Men like you thought it up.

788
01:38:27,225 --> 01:38:29,375
You think you're so creative.

789
01:38:30,345 --> 01:38:33,064
You don't know what it's like
to create something.

790
01:38:33,425 --> 01:38:35,097
To create a life.

791
01:38:35,625 --> 01:38:37,183
To feel it growing inside you.

792
01:38:37,465 --> 01:38:41,014
All you know how to create
is death and destruction. - Mom!

793
01:38:41,745 --> 01:38:45,135
We need to be a little more
constructive here, okay?

794
01:38:45,465 --> 01:38:48,059
We still have to
stop this from happening.

795
01:38:48,345 --> 01:38:49,778
But I thought...

796
01:38:50,305 --> 01:38:54,014
Aren't we changing things?
Changing the way it goes?

797
01:38:54,305 --> 01:38:55,374
That's right!

798
01:38:55,665 --> 01:38:58,941
There's no way I'm gonna
finish the processor. Not now.

799
01:38:59,225 --> 01:39:00,704
Forget it. I'm out of it.

800
01:39:01,345 --> 01:39:03,859
I quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- Not good enough.

801
01:39:04,145 --> 01:39:08,775
No one must follow your work.
- Right, then...

802
01:39:10,425 --> 01:39:13,383
We have to destroy the stuff
at the lab. The files, drives...

803
01:39:13,745 --> 01:39:15,975
Everything. Everything here.

804
01:39:16,905 --> 01:39:19,578
Everything! I don't care.

805
01:39:21,825 --> 01:39:24,259
Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

806
01:39:24,545 --> 01:39:27,298
In a vault at Cyberdyne.
From the other one like you.

807
01:39:27,585 --> 01:39:29,337
The CPU from the first terminator.

808
01:39:29,705 --> 01:39:31,696
Son of a bitch, I knew it!

809
01:39:32,105 --> 01:39:34,380
They told us
not to ask where they got it.

810
01:39:34,745 --> 01:39:36,701
Those lying motherfuckers!

811
01:39:37,065 --> 01:39:38,498
It was radically advanced.

812
01:39:38,865 --> 01:39:42,255
It was smashed, it didn't work.
But it gave us ideas,

813
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:45,219
took us in new directions.
Things we'd never...

814
01:39:47,785 --> 01:39:51,095
All my work is based on it.
- It must be destroyed.

815
01:39:53,745 --> 01:39:56,179
Can you get us in, past security?

816
01:39:56,545 --> 01:39:57,944
I think so, yeah.

817
01:39:58,225 --> 01:39:59,340
When?

818
01:40:03,025 --> 01:40:03,980
Now?

819
01:40:08,145 --> 01:40:10,818
The future, always so clear to me,

820
01:40:11,105 --> 01:40:13,619
had become like
a black highway at night.

821
01:40:13,905 --> 01:40:16,499
We were
in uncharted territory now,

822
01:40:16,785 --> 01:40:19,140
making up history as we went along.

823
01:40:53,585 --> 01:40:54,540
Hi.

824
01:40:56,825 --> 01:40:58,383
Carl, right?

825
01:40:59,545 --> 01:41:01,661
Friends from outta town,
Thought I'd. . .

826
01:41:02,825 --> 01:41:04,338
...show them around.

827
01:41:04,705 --> 01:41:07,538
You know
the rules concerning visitors.

828
01:41:07,905 --> 01:41:09,497
I need authorization...

829
01:41:11,025 --> 01:41:12,140
I insist.

830
01:41:13,185 --> 01:41:14,379
Don't even think about it.

831
01:41:28,105 --> 01:41:31,063
Takes 2 keys to open the vault,
turned simultaneously.

832
01:41:31,345 --> 01:41:33,540
The other one is
at the security station.

833
01:41:35,225 --> 01:41:36,180
Gibbons.

834
01:41:40,585 --> 01:41:44,498
Come on, man,
you can't leave the desk like that.

835
01:41:49,185 --> 01:41:50,174
Oh, shit.

836
01:42:07,305 --> 01:42:08,784
My card should access this.

837
01:42:13,585 --> 01:42:15,337
What is it?
- Dammit.

838
01:42:15,825 --> 01:42:17,975
The silent alarm's been tripped.

839
01:42:24,145 --> 01:42:26,705
It's neutralized
all the codes in the building.

840
01:42:26,985 --> 01:42:28,941
Nothing'll open anywhere now.

841
01:42:29,225 --> 01:42:31,022
We have to abort.

842
01:42:31,305 --> 01:42:32,294
No.

843
01:42:34,185 --> 01:42:37,143
We do it all the way! Okay?

844
01:42:40,185 --> 01:42:42,858
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

845
01:42:43,225 --> 01:42:46,103
I think it's that guy
from the mall. - It is the guy!

846
01:42:46,385 --> 01:42:48,182
Him and the woman.

847
01:42:49,185 --> 01:42:51,779
Just send everything
you've got in the area.

848
01:42:54,265 --> 01:42:57,621
I have a personal entry code
for the lab that may still work.

849
01:43:01,905 --> 01:43:04,465
It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

850
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:10,863
John! Fire-in-the-hole!

851
01:43:23,305 --> 01:43:25,421
Wait! You can't go in there!

852
01:43:26,065 --> 01:43:28,340
The fire's set off the halo system !

853
01:43:34,225 --> 01:43:37,217
You have to wait a few minutes,
until the gas clears.

854
01:43:38,905 --> 01:43:39,860
Put this on.

855
01:43:54,065 --> 01:43:55,703
Alright, let's get to work.

856
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:19,423
All units in the vicinity,
all units able to respond:

857
01:44:19,705 --> 01:44:24,142
A 21 1 in progress at 21 44 Kramer
Street, the Cyberdyne building.

858
01:44:24,425 --> 01:44:25,983
Suspect 1 is white, female,

859
01:44:26,265 --> 01:44:29,382
identified as: last name Connor,
first name Sarah,

860
01:44:29,665 --> 01:44:32,225
escaped from
Pescadero State Hospital.

861
01:44:32,505 --> 01:44:33,699
Suspect 2: white, male. . .

862
01:44:37,865 --> 01:44:41,699
All the disks in my office. All the
disks in that office over there.

863
01:44:41,985 --> 01:44:43,816
Everything behind my desk.

864
01:44:44,105 --> 01:44:45,982
All the processors on my left.

865
01:44:46,265 --> 01:44:47,903
We'll blow it up with the CP4.

866
01:45:01,665 --> 01:45:02,939
Could I . . .

867
01:45:03,465 --> 01:45:04,898
Excuse me...

868
01:45:07,065 --> 01:45:09,056
Could I borrow that thing?

869
01:45:18,225 --> 01:45:20,341
I worked a lot
of years on this thing.

870
01:45:24,345 --> 01:45:28,304
Give me that location again.
- 21 1 1 , Kramer.

871
01:45:28,585 --> 01:45:32,021
The suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.

872
01:46:21,305 --> 01:46:22,658
Alright,

873
01:46:22,985 --> 01:46:24,418
7-2-5-6.

874
01:46:26,825 --> 01:46:27,940
Yes!

875
01:46:31,745 --> 01:46:32,973
Easy money.

876
01:46:41,345 --> 01:46:45,020
Oh, shit.
Not good. Not good.

877
01:46:48,825 --> 01:46:51,703
How we doing?
- Primal cord is set.

878
01:46:52,065 --> 01:46:55,740
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

879
01:46:58,185 --> 01:47:00,574
How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

880
01:47:01,145 --> 01:47:02,658
Piece of cake.

881
01:47:02,945 --> 01:47:04,503
We got company.
- Police?

882
01:47:04,945 --> 01:47:07,459
How many?
- All of them, I think.

883
01:47:08,105 --> 01:47:10,665
Go! I'll finish here.

884
01:47:13,665 --> 01:47:16,498
I'll take care of the police.
- Wait, you swore. . .

885
01:47:19,625 --> 01:47:21,138
Trust me.

886
01:47:33,785 --> 01:47:35,662
Hey you at the window,

887
01:47:36,025 --> 01:47:39,415
drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head.

888
01:47:41,905 --> 01:47:44,294
That's a damn mini-gun!

889
01:48:05,545 --> 01:48:08,059
Come on! Go!

890
01:48:37,545 --> 01:48:39,058
Go! Go!

891
01:48:53,905 --> 01:48:55,577
Fire!

892
01:49:12,465 --> 01:49:16,219
We go the same time to the left.
One, two, three, go!

893
01:49:27,905 --> 01:49:30,055
Alright.
In order to get that out, you. . .

894
01:49:37,425 --> 01:49:41,020
We got Skynet by the balls now,
don't we? Come on, let's book!

895
01:49:42,505 --> 01:49:43,733
Hold your fire!

896
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:10,460
Ready to rock?
- Ready.

897
01:50:13,745 --> 01:50:15,542
Time to go. Now.

898
01:50:16,265 --> 01:50:18,495
Take this. They'll use gas.

899
01:50:19,345 --> 01:50:20,744
Get started on the door.

900
01:50:21,385 --> 01:50:23,216
Miles, hand me the detonator.

901
01:50:45,865 --> 01:50:47,218
Mom! Mom !

902
01:51:33,225 --> 01:51:36,376
Shit! She's in the clean room.
There's no way out of there.

903
01:51:45,785 --> 01:51:46,740
Get down!

904
01:51:53,545 --> 01:51:54,898
Here.

905
01:52:19,145 --> 01:52:21,978
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

906
01:52:26,585 --> 01:52:27,540
Fall back!

907
01:52:27,905 --> 01:52:29,133
Everybody out!

908
01:52:29,505 --> 01:52:30,984
Move it! Now! Go!

909
01:53:05,785 --> 01:53:06,854
We have a war zone here.

910
01:53:38,665 --> 01:53:39,939
Shut your eyes.

911
01:53:45,625 --> 01:53:48,344
Stay here. I'll be back.

912
01:53:56,585 --> 01:53:58,223
Down on the floor, face down!

913
01:54:01,185 --> 01:54:02,334
On the floor, now!

914
01:54:05,225 --> 01:54:06,704
Okay, drop him !

915
01:55:22,945 --> 01:55:24,139
Here, hold this.

916
01:55:57,305 --> 01:55:58,260
Go!

917
01:56:48,665 --> 01:56:49,893
Get out!

918
01:57:08,785 --> 01:57:12,095
Listen, no matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

919
01:57:12,465 --> 01:57:14,262
You got it?
- Yeah.

920
01:57:29,105 --> 01:57:31,141
Chopper is coming in!
- It's him.

921
01:58:30,985 --> 01:58:31,974
Stay down!

922
01:59:37,065 --> 01:59:38,020
Hello?

923
01:59:43,985 --> 01:59:45,259
Goddamn,

924
01:59:45,625 --> 01:59:46,694
you alright?

925
01:59:53,545 --> 01:59:55,820
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

926
01:59:57,745 --> 01:59:59,497
Take the shotgun.
- Okay.

927
02:00:02,745 --> 02:00:04,656
Are you hurt?

928
02:00:17,145 --> 02:00:18,942
Holy shit. Come on!

929
02:00:19,385 --> 02:00:21,580
We need your truck.
- Hurry!

930
02:00:27,585 --> 02:00:28,859
Hurry!
- Get in.

931
02:00:38,945 --> 02:00:40,537
What the hell...

932
02:00:46,905 --> 02:00:48,816
I'm bleeding bad !
- Keep pressure on it.

933
02:00:50,185 --> 02:00:51,982
Here, this'll work.

934
02:00:58,025 --> 02:00:58,980
He's gaining !

935
02:01:01,785 --> 02:01:04,253
Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

936
02:01:04,625 --> 02:01:07,423
I can get out
and run faster than this!

937
02:01:16,545 --> 02:01:18,615
He's coming up, to the right.

938
02:01:43,425 --> 02:01:46,019
Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

939
02:01:52,585 --> 02:01:54,143
Take the off ramp.

940
02:02:08,945 --> 02:02:09,980
Hold on!

941
02:02:53,585 --> 02:02:55,064
Don't stop!

942
02:03:02,345 --> 02:03:03,744
Go straight!

943
02:03:21,545 --> 02:03:23,137
Get the hell out of here!

944
02:03:28,745 --> 02:03:30,576
Get out of here. Let's go!

945
02:04:45,385 --> 02:04:48,343
Hasta la vista, baby.

946
02:05:35,225 --> 02:05:36,499
We don't have much time.

947
02:05:58,545 --> 02:05:59,819
Let's go!

948
02:06:01,145 --> 02:06:03,295
Come on, we gotta get out of here!

949
02:06:03,825 --> 02:06:04,780
Get up!

950
02:06:17,385 --> 02:06:18,818
Hand me the shotgun.

951
02:06:23,785 --> 02:06:25,138
Put your weight on me, Mom.

952
02:06:26,865 --> 02:06:27,854
Hurry!

953
02:06:32,185 --> 02:06:33,220
Come on, Mom !

954
02:06:40,145 --> 02:06:42,056
Come on, Mom, get up!

955
02:07:11,265 --> 02:07:12,778
This way. Come on!

956
02:07:39,425 --> 02:07:40,619
Wait.

957
02:07:41,025 --> 02:07:42,902
Wait, no, it's too hot.

958
02:07:43,225 --> 02:07:44,340
Go back!

959
02:07:52,545 --> 02:07:54,376
Run!
- No, we stick together.

960
02:07:54,785 --> 02:07:57,345
John, you gotta go now.

961
02:07:57,785 --> 02:08:00,140
Go now!
- No!

962
02:09:10,145 --> 02:09:14,423
Take these steps. Go.

963
02:09:20,465 --> 02:09:22,899
Help me.
- I got you. Come on.

964
02:09:56,265 --> 02:09:58,825
Grab the chain. Grab it!

965
02:09:59,785 --> 02:10:01,298
Grab it! Go!

966
02:10:12,265 --> 02:10:13,698
Mom! Come on!

967
02:11:02,945 --> 02:11:04,094
Call to John.

968
02:11:05,745 --> 02:11:06,700
No.

969
02:11:07,345 --> 02:11:08,539
I know this hurts.

970
02:11:10,865 --> 02:11:11,854
Call John.

971
02:11:28,545 --> 02:11:29,978
Call to John now.

972
02:11:32,585 --> 02:11:33,859
Fuck you.

973
02:14:42,945 --> 02:14:44,856
John! Help!

974
02:14:51,945 --> 02:14:52,900
John!

975
02:15:07,545 --> 02:15:08,898
Help me.

976
02:15:12,305 --> 02:15:13,260
Out of the way, John!

977
02:15:16,825 --> 02:15:18,019
Shoot!

978
02:16:10,345 --> 02:16:11,744
Down!

979
02:17:42,145 --> 02:17:43,260
Get up.

980
02:17:43,545 --> 02:17:44,614
Come on.

981
02:17:46,305 --> 02:17:47,704
Holy shit!

982
02:17:48,065 --> 02:17:50,374
I need a vacation.

983
02:18:03,425 --> 02:18:04,653
Is it dead?

984
02:18:05,945 --> 02:18:07,014
Terminated.

985
02:18:10,825 --> 02:18:11,974
Will this melt in there?

986
02:18:15,265 --> 02:18:16,584
Yes. Throw it in.

987
02:18:20,985 --> 02:18:22,179
Adios.

988
02:18:24,105 --> 02:18:25,220
And the chip.

989
02:18:39,825 --> 02:18:41,258
It's over.

990
02:18:44,105 --> 02:18:45,333
No.

991
02:18:48,225 --> 02:18:49,704
There is one more chip.

992
02:18:54,545 --> 02:18:56,183
And it must be
destroyed also.

993
02:19:01,825 --> 02:19:02,780
Here.

994
02:19:03,265 --> 02:19:08,100
I can't self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

995
02:19:14,985 --> 02:19:15,940
No!

996
02:19:19,865 --> 02:19:21,457
I'm sorry, John.

997
02:19:21,865 --> 02:19:23,503
It'll be okay. Stay with us!

998
02:19:24,905 --> 02:19:28,022
I have to go away.
- No don't do it, please don't go.

999
02:19:28,385 --> 02:19:30,945
I must go away, John.
- No.

1000
02:19:31,625 --> 02:19:32,580
No, wait.

1001
02:19:32,945 --> 02:19:34,173
You don't have to.

1002
02:19:34,545 --> 02:19:35,500
Sorry.

1003
02:19:36,785 --> 02:19:38,582
No, don't do it, don't go!

1004
02:19:38,945 --> 02:19:40,583
It has to end here.

1005
02:19:42,065 --> 02:19:44,738
I order you not to go.

1006
02:19:52,705 --> 02:19:55,060
I know now why you cry.

1007
02:19:56,905 --> 02:19:59,783
But it's something I can never do.

1008
02:20:32,585 --> 02:20:34,064
Goodbye.

1009
02:22:09,425 --> 02:22:12,064
The unknown future
rolls toward us.

1010
02:22:12,425 --> 02:22:15,258
I face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.

1011
02:22:16,225 --> 02:22:18,420
Because if a machine, a terminator,

1012
02:22:18,745 --> 02:22:21,100
can learn the value of human life,

1013
02:22:21,545 --> 02:22:24,139
maybe we can too.
