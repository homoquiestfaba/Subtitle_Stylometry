Skyler?

17
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,128
Skyler!

18
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:03,677
I didn't hear you.

19
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,081
Girl, I could bang pots and pans
outside your door

20
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,748
until my blood pressure
got the best of me,

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,985
and you still
wouldn't have answered.

22
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,719
Sorry. I was dancing.

23
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:14,254
Is that what that's called?

24
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:18,126
Looked more to me like you was possessed
by a chicken havin' a spaz attack.

25
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:21,161
- What's up, Ma?
- What's up is I'm headin' to work.

26
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:24,498
Oh! Don't forget to fill out that
application for the program.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,036
Okay?

28
00:01:31,274 --> 00:01:33,141
I haven't
made up my mind yet.

29
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:35,643
Made up your mind?

30
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:38,278
Look, now that you're done with
Greenpeace and finding yourself,

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,081
you're either getting
a full-time job

32
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,783
or we agreed you'd
sign up for the program.

33
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:44,385
I don't think takin' blood is what I
wanna do for the rest of my life.

34
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:48,156
The course is only for three months.
You'll have your certificate.

35
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:51,191
Maggie makes $17 an hour.
That's good money.

36
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:53,495
I know, but I just
don't even like blood.

37
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:56,631
I don't like cleaning
hotel rooms either,

38
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:59,501
but I do it so that you girls can
have a better life than I had.

39
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:01,668
Listen, I wouldn't
be pushing you so hard,

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,539
but Maggie's pulling a lot of strings
to get you a job at the clinic.

41
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,307
She's not gonna be there
for much longer,

42
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:07,809
so it's kind of
now or never.

43
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,278
I hear ya, Mom.

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,780
Why does Tosha get to do
what she wants?

45
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:15,215
Baby, you just spent a whole
year abroad doing your thing,

46
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:17,251
so don't act like now I'm
the Wicked Witch of the West.

47
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:19,320
Well, it's just not fair.

48
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:22,156
Skyler, you're better suited
for working with your head.

49
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:23,825
Now, Tosha,
on the other hand,

50
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:26,361
she's a natural
at dancing, entertaining.

51
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:29,096
- That's <i>her</i> gift.
- Right.

52
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,499
Your sister barely graduated.
Thank God for her gift.

53
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:34,237
Thank God for that.

54
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,775
- Love you.
- Love you too.

55
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,375
What you starin' at, Sis?

56
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:17,479
- Did you see this?
- What is that?

57
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:19,613
First prize is a full
college scholarship.

58
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,516
I did see that.

59
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:24,319
But did you also see the
words, "USA Dance World?"

60
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:26,421
They are the best
of the best, girl.

61
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:28,623
But you say Pulsar
is number one.

62
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,259
- In the city.
- Why not the country?

63
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:34,462
No, you're right.
I mean, why not think big?

64
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,332
Especially if we have a dope
crew this year, Sky. Who knows?

65
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:39,333
You don't know who's
gonna make the crew?

66
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:42,303
Miss J makes everybody audition, even
if they were on the team last year.

67
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,873
So, you don't even know if
you're gonna make the crew, huh?

68
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,741
Girl, no, no.
I'll make the crew.

69
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:49,476
But she gonna make everybody try
out just to keep us humble, girl.

70
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:50,879
- You know her.
- Hey, Skyler.

71
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:52,747
- Hey. What's up, y'all?
- What's up?

72
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:55,249
You thinkin'
of tryin' out?

73
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:57,452
- Have you seen her dance?
- Wow. Thanks a lot.

74
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:59,720
No, no, no. I'm just sayin'.

75
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:02,356
- If she wants to try out, let her try out.
- Yeah. Why not?

76
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:04,691
'Cause Pulsar is not for beginners.
Thank you, Bryce.

77
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:05,827
Okay, come on.

78
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,296
Anyway,
I stopped by because

79
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:11,198
you left your phone on the
kitchen counter, airhead.

80
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,867
- I did?
- Yes.

81
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:15,569
- Ooh.
- Look, I gotta go. I gotta get to work.

82
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:17,271
So I'm-a see y'all later.

83
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:18,809
- All right. Bye.
- Peace. Later, Sky.

84
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:22,776
- Hey, I won't forget what you said.
- Okay, don't be...

85
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:26,648
All right, ladies.
Now make it sexy.

86
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,549
Here we go.
Startin' on the left.

87
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:30,651
Five, six, seven, go.

88
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:36,223
Other side.

89
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,528

We gonna follow Dante.

97
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:07,722
Go on from here.
Ready?

98
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,760

105
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,318

Oh!

106
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,454

I'm tryin' to teach
the whole class a routine.

110
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:53,367
This is not the Maya Show.

111
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:56,470
If your head gets any bigger, I'm
gonna have to widen the doors.

112
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:58,273
- I was just feelin' it.
- Yeah.

113
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,408
I didn't mean for it
to turn into no battle.

114
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,910
Well, that's good, because
if it was a real battle,

115
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:05,715
I would've stepped in
and crushed you.

116
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,818
I'm sorry, Miss J.
Won't happen again.

117
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,723
Oh, I know it won't.

118
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:18,925
All right, what's everybody starin' at?
Class is over.

119
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:21,561
Don't forget, Pulsar tryouts
are right around the corner.

120
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:25,001
From what I saw today,
some of y'all need some work.

121
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:29,970
Jada's just mad 'cause you're a
better dancer then she ever was.

122
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,506
- You killed it.
- Thanks, girl.

123
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:32,309
You're welcome.

124
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:37,778
Yeah?

125
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,681
- Hey, Miss J.
- Hey.

126
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:41,818
I was hoping
if we have time next class,

127
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,552
you could take us through
that last combination again.

128
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,023
Maya kind of
took things off track.

129
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:50,023
Yeah. Maya has a habit
of doin' that.

130
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,727
- You know what I think her problem is?
- What's that, Nia?

131
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,862
She thinks she's better
than everybody else.

132
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:57,698
Well, to be fair,
she is our best dancer.

133
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,835
Yeah. When she's saying she's a better
dancer than you ever even were,

134
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:04,504
I think that's
just straight disrespectful.

135
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:07,641
- She said that?
- I shouldn't have said anything.

136
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:09,646
Gotta learn to keep my mouth shut.
I'll see you Tuesday.

137
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:19,787
Yo, I'll take one of those,
one of those,

138
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:24,424
one of those, and... mm-mm-mm...
definitely one of those.

139
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:27,494
- You are so not funny.
- I thought you were supposed to be off.

140
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:30,131
- Nope, I got another ten.
- Yeah?

141
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,033
You tryin' to get me fired?

142
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,568
Come on.
Give me a little one.

143
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,569
You are something else.

144
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:37,138
All right.
You be like that.

145
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,540
I'm gonna be right over
there, countin' the seconds.

146
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,645
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm!

147
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:49,117
Girl, your man is a trip.
Whoo!

148
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,451
I don't know
what I see in him.

149
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:53,787
Well, I see exactly
what you see in him.

150
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:56,025
Hey, that ass is mine.

151
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,727
I'm just sayin',
that's all.

152
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,064
But lucky for you, I got my
man over there on the skates.

153
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,032
Hey, baby!

154
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:07,068
Hey, baby.

155
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,605
Hey, baby!

156
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:11,773
You know,
I really don't like you.

157
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,577

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:28,855
- I can put it back on if that's what you like.
- Nah.

162
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:31,125
I just got a thing
for women in uniform.

163
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,928

164

- No. I like corny.

166
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:44,838
I don't know.
But that's on the house.

167
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,376
These wings
or that kiss?

168
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,477
Look.

169
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,478
- What's that?
- A dance competition.

170
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,714
And the first prize is a
full four-year scholarship.

171
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:56,717
They're going
to enter the Pulsar.

172
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,756
- That crew that your sister dances for?
- Yes.

173
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,223
So, why you showin' me?

174
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,825
'Cause I'm thinkin'
'bout joinin' the crew.

175
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:07,995
The Pulsar? You think you're
just gonna show up and join?

176
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:10,931
No, but they have
open tryouts in two weeks.

177
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,632
Yeah, babe,
so do the Falcons,

178
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:15,069
but if I tried to walk on
there, I'd get slaughtered.

179
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,536
You think
I'll get slaughtered?

180
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:18,139
No, I don't think
you'll get slaughtered.

181
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,674
- I think I'm good enough.
- Okay.

182
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:22,776
Where's the sudden interest in dancing?
That's all I'm asking.

183
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:24,812
What are you talking about?
I'm always dancin'.

184
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,848
I rap every morning
in the shower.

185
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,217
- That don't make me Eminem.
- Wow!

186
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:31,618
Do not compare my dancing
to your rapping.

187
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,621
Okay. Okay.
Bad comparison.

188
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:37,157
I'm just saying, your sister
goes to school for dance.

189
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,059
You just dance for fun.

190
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,996
Look, this is my chance at
potentially gettin' a scholarship.

191
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,131
And that too. You never even talked
about going to college before.

192
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,801
I didn't even think that was an option.
I don't have the money for that.

193
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:50,570
That's why you should be happy that
your mom's trying to hook you up.

194
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:52,973
You make it sound like she's sending
me to Harvard or something.

195
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:56,676
It is a three-month course
on collectin' blood

196
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:58,545
and collectin'
urine samples.

197
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:00,817
Seriously. And I'm supposed
to just thank her for that?

198
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:05,620
Look, if you have a chance
to make the Pulsar, go for it.

199
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:08,655
- Are you just sayin' that?
- No.

200
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:11,992
Now, you slide over to my place
tonight when you get off.

201
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:15,729
Look, I appreciate
the proposition and all,

202
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:17,631
but I gotta practice.

203
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:21,102
I gotta get up on my game if I'm
serious about joining this crew.

204
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,971
The manager said I could stay
back and dance after we close,

205
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:26,107
so that's even more lit.

206
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:28,177
I knew I hated
this damn dance thing.

238
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:31,232
You're not tryin' out, are you?
Honey Studio's best dancer?

239
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:34,168
Girl, you know Jada don't
be playing no favorites.

240
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,038
More like she wants
to put you in your place.

241
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,906
I can't be nobody's bitch. If you're
fine with that, who am I to judge?

242
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:42,809
- First off, I'm not her bitch.
- So prove it.

243
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:44,310
Here's your chance.

244
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:46,914
Okay, people.
Tryouts start in 15.

245
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,016
When I call your name,
you will have one minute-30

246
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,751
to show me what you got,
all right?

247
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:52,453
- Where you goin'?
- To the mall.

248
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:55,055
Didn't you just hear me
say tryouts start in 15?

249
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:57,323
Well, you can text me and let me
know who's gonna be on the crew.

250
00:12:57,325 --> 00:12:58,958
Okay. My office.

251
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,397
- What?
- Now!

252
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,937
What the hell were you tryin'
to prove out there?

253
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:12,439
You know my rules.
Every season it's a new crew.

254
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:14,375
Anybody who wants in
tries out,

255
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,944
even if they been on the team
for three years.

256
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:19,179
Look, it's not fair
to the other dancers

257
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:21,448
who work hard all year
to improve their skills

258
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,753
only to find
that they didn't have a shot.

259
00:13:26,154 --> 00:13:28,856
I don't know what's gotten
into your head lately,

260
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,761
but you better start
showing me some respect.

261
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:34,795
Now, if you wanna be
a part of the Pulsar,

262
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:39,369
you will get back out there
and try out like everybody else.

263
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:50,144
- Tosha.
- Hmm?

264
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:53,046
- Check it out.
- Oh, my gosh. She came.

265
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,281
- That girl is my biggest fan.
- Oh, you mean besides your mom?

266
00:13:55,283 --> 00:13:57,785
Ooh, I stand corrected.
That is true.

267
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:59,252
Sis!

268
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:01,856
- What's up?
- Look, listen.

269
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:04,525
I appreciate the support.
I promise you, I do.

270
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:07,294
But you did not have to come all
this way to watch me audition.

271
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:10,363
- It is not that serious.
- I know.

272
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:13,000
- But I didn't come to watch you.
- Okay.

273
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:14,434
What... Did something
happen to Mom?

274
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,437
No. She's fine.

275
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,039
Oh.

276
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,876
- So, what you doin' here?
- I'm about to try out for Pulsar.

277
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,077
- Yeah.
- What?

278
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,512
You're trying out
for this team?

279
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:26,914
Yeah.

280
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:33,820
Okay, that was good.
You got me.

281
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,222
'Cause that was a joke,
right?

282
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:37,157
No. I'm not playin'.

283
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:39,260
- Yeah, you go, girl.
- Why are you...

284
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:41,098
- Jamaica, go back! Go back.
- Sorry.

285
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,865
I mean,
what do I have to lose?

286
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,967
Skyler,
we talked about this.

287
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,102
Pulsar is not
for beginners.

288
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:51,872
And I don't wanna see you get
up there and embarrass yourself

289
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:53,907
or hurt yourself
or do anything like that.

290
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:56,142
- Embarrass myself?
- Yes, Skyler.

291
00:14:56,144 --> 00:15:00,280
I really think you might be nervous
that I might make the team.

292
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:02,082
- I'm nervous?
- Yeah.

293
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:05,953
I'm just lookin'
out for you, Sky. That's it.

294
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:09,890
Well, okay, good, 'cause I'm gonna
need you to be cheering for me.

295
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:12,059
Cheer for you... Skyler!

296
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:15,297
All right, everybody. Let's
get this show on the road.

297
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,934
Start with the fellas.
Guys, you're up.

298
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,008

I'll be posting the results outside of
my office today at 5:00 p.m. sharp.

359
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,299
Whoo!

360
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:40,637
Good luck.

361
00:18:52,113 --> 00:18:54,248
Dancers!

362
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,416
Results
are posted inside!

363
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:58,620
Okay, come on. Let's go.

364
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,288
Okay.

365
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,290
Wait.
Shouldn't we go look?

366
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,626
We just don't wanna
look desperate.

367
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:08,462
See, that's fine with me. I was the
last name on the list last year.

368
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:11,065
- Come on. Let's go be desperate together.
- Okay.

369
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,369
Let's go.

370
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:17,171
I made it.
I made it.

371
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:19,440
- How did that happen?
- Yeah, how did that happen, Jamaica?

372
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:21,642
- Seriously, dude?
- No, I'm just kidding.

373
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:24,478
Jamaica, you know
we got your back, bro.

374
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,417
- Hey, I made it though.
- Hey, yo!

375
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,798
At least you tried.

376
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,401
I'm sorry, Sky.

377
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:49,569
You did well.

378
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:51,273
Come on.

379
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,378
Yeah.

380
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,316
Mm-hmm.

381
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:08,121
Congratulations.
You are all Pulsar now.

382
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,457
Hey!

383
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:14,560
All right, all right. For our
dancers who are new to the crew,

384
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:17,199
I expect you to learn fast and
live up to the crew's reputation.

385
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,666
And for those members
who are returning,

386
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:22,469
I expect you
to raise your game,

387
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,505
so don't think you can rely
on what you did last year, okay?

388
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:27,707
- Don't forget about Angelique.
- Ah.

389
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:29,609
We do have one minor hiccup.

390
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:31,712
As you may have noticed,
Angelique is not here.

391
00:20:31,714 --> 00:20:35,449
She had to withdraw because her family
is moving back to West Virginia.

392
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:38,851
So, her spot will be going
to our alternate,

393
00:20:38,853 --> 00:20:40,753
Skyler.

394
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:42,489
- What?
- Who?

395
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,758
Skyler.

396
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,729
And since she's your sister, I will let you
have the honor of giving her the good news.

397
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:53,332
Oh, okay. Well, she'll
be surprised for sure.

398
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:54,703
All right.
Let's spread out and stretch.

399
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:02,475

400
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:04,377

00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:43,644

434

459
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:41,161
Girl, looked more
like possession to me.

460
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:44,630
- Don't hate, Maya.
- Hey, it was sexy to me.

461
00:24:44,632 --> 00:24:47,567
If you into that hood-vibe
thing, I guess.

462
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,569
Oh, why y'all throwin'
all this shade at our girl?

463
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,438
You looked good
on the floor.

464
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,908
- Maya got her stare on.
- He's been starin' at me since we got up in here.

465
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,743
Can I have him
when you're done?

466
00:24:57,745 --> 00:24:59,646
You want
Maya's leftovers?

467
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,848
I have three older sisters.
I'm used to hand-me-downs.

468
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,017
Wait, wait, wait. Maya, before
you get too excited, dear,

469
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:05,719
I think you readin' him
all wrong.

470
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:07,087
How is that, Tosha?

471
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,121
Oh, you didn't see him
lookin' this way?

472
00:25:09,123 --> 00:25:11,023
Girl, good night,
all right?

473
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:13,092
I saw him first.
Don't try it.

474
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,428
I don't know why you all
are being so possessive.

475
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,129
Men are like buses.

476
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:19,065
You wait long enough, another
one comes back around.

477
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:22,472
Nia, open your eyes. That boy is not a bus.
He's a Ferrari. Vroom!

478
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:25,608
Girl, you know
you want him.

479
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:29,144

I'm just eatin' my cereal

508
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:39,779
You look like you got
something on your mind.

509
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:42,081
Tyrell, maybe?

510
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,049
- Why are you pressin' that?
- Why you got a attitude?

511
00:26:44,051 --> 00:26:46,685
You're not jealous that he asked
me to dance and not you, right?

512
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:48,888
Why I gotta be jealous? I can't
just ask you a question?

I ain't gonna ask you nothin' else.

514
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,765
- Hi.
- Hey, babe.

515
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:01,600
What are you doing here
so early?

516
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:04,037
- Just checkin' to see if you're okay.
- Why wouldn't I be?

517
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,905
Oh, I've been callin' you
all night.

518
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:07,706
Oh, damn.

519
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:10,644
My battery died yesterday,
and by the time we got home,

520
00:27:10,646 --> 00:27:12,811
I done forgot to put it on
the charger, I was so tired.

521
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:15,014
Oh, no, babe, that's fine.
I was just on my way to work.

522
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:17,751
- Wanted to make sure my girl was okay.
- Oh!

523
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:19,618
That's so sweet.

524
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,320
That's not sweet.
That's stalker-ish.

525
00:27:21,322 --> 00:27:24,156
Yeah, right. So, where
were you last night?

526
00:27:24,158 --> 00:27:26,126
Oh, I meant to tell you.
I made Pulsar.

527
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:28,895
What? Are you serious?

528
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,931
What, you think
I'm makin' it up?

529
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:34,901
No, no. Congratulations, babe.
I had no idea.

530
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,636
Everybody who made the dance group,
we all went out to celebrate.

531
00:27:37,638 --> 00:27:39,973
- So, that's what I was doing yesterday.
- You should've called me.

532
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:42,107
- I'd have met up with you guys.
- It wasn't that kinda scene.

533
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:44,277
It was just the dancers. Like, literally.
We just went out...

534
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,212
No, it was just us dancers.
She right.

535
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:48,848
Just us dancers
doin' dancer things.

536
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,884
- You know what we do.
- Okay. Well...

537
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,686
I'll leave you two dancers
to do what dancers do.

538
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:55,722
I gotta get to work.
I'll see you later, okay, babe?

539
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:57,290
- All right.
- All right. I'll see you soon.

540
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:58,528
- See ya, Tosh.
- Bye.

541
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:06,801
- Oh, you was dancin', all right.
- You so petty.

542
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:09,636
Listen up.

543
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:12,838
We got a lot of work to do
between now and Dance World.

544
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,974
Only if we make it
into the finals

545
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,309
do we get
to the one-on-one battles.

546
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:21,114
As you know, I can only send
one dancer into the battle,

547
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,249
who will represent
for the entire crew.

548
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:26,886
As our soloist,
I have chosen Maya.

549
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,725
I'm ready. You know I am.

550
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:34,229
Good, 'cause we
countin' on you.

551
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:37,963
And five, six, seven, go.

552
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:40,269
I don't know what you do...
Who's that?

553
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:43,770
Ah!

554
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:45,938
- Tyrell?
- So what?

555
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,308
- You gave Tyrell your number?
- He asked for it.

556
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,778
No. Don't you ever call me
easy ever again, Skyler.

557
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,146
- No, no, stop, stop.
- Uh-uh.

558
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:57,349
No, he wants me to come check
out an underground battle.

559
00:28:57,351 --> 00:28:59,819
Oh. Well,
that sounds dope, Sky.

560
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,121
Exactly.
So you comin' or not?

561
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:04,691
I would come with you, but I
don't wanna be a third wheel.

562
00:29:04,693 --> 00:29:07,092
I don't mind being third wheel.
I'm into sharing.

563
00:29:07,094 --> 00:29:09,061
No, thanks. I'm not.

564
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:11,330
Besides, it's not a date.

565
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,899
Okay, if it's not a date, why you
not askin' Luke to go with you?

566
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:17,369
Because Luke don't even like dance music.
Plus, I wanna check it out.

567
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:20,339
Okay. You don't need my permission, girl.
Go have fun.

568
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,308
Hey, if you change your mind,
I'm still up for it.

569
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,043
No, thanks, Jamaica.

570
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:27,146
- Hey, don't knock it till you try it.
- Ooh!

571
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:29,949
- Did he just say what I think he said?
- We're not gonna address that.

572
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:31,917
- Okay.
- We gonna move past it like he didn't say it.

00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:31,985
It's not like Honey, but it's somewhere
where I can work on my moves

654
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,518
and get better.

655
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,322
Well, that sounds cool, but I
just wanna be honest with you.

656
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:40,492
- I do have a boyfriend.
- I figured.

657
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:42,762
And that's cool, 'cause I'm
talkin' strictly dancin'.

658
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:45,297
You a good dancer.
You could be great.

659
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:47,632
I just wanna
help you with that.

660
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:50,036
And what do you get
out of all of this?

661
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:54,139
I'm not gonna lie. Workin' with
you makes me a better dancer.

662
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:56,175
I could show you
some things.

663
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,012
That's the whole deal.

664
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,716
Well, I get off at 4:00.

665
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,585
I'll see you then.

666
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:29,044
This is it.

667
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:40,420
This is...
really different.

668
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:42,554
Not exactly
what you was expectin'?

669
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:46,261
No, but not in a bad way.
This is dope.

670
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:51,096
Yeah, the owner hired me
to manage the compound

671
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:53,565
and to take the rent
from the artists who use it.

672
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:55,703
In return, he lets me
use this space to rehearse.

673
00:35:57,404 --> 00:35:58,572
Let me see you freestyle.

674
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:04,811
I don't know. It's just usually
easier when there's a crowd.

675
00:36:04,813 --> 00:36:06,615
Don't be shy.
It's just me watchin'.

676
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,817
- Nah.
- Nah?

677
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:13,121
I'll go first.

678
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:19,224
Follow along
when you're ready.

679
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,264
<i>Yeah.</i>

680
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,833
Start off slow.

681
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:32,204
Get into the space.

682
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:34,540
Tease the crowd.

683
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:36,342

Not bad.

704
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:31,663
But you got a lot more
in you.

705
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:34,333
Oh, shit. I'm gonna be
late for Pulsar rehearsal.

706
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,436
I'll get you there on time.

707
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:55,855
We're here.

708
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,893
Thanks a lot. I had fun.

709
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:01,259
It was a good start, Sky,

710
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:02,895
but you got
a lot more work to do.

711
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:04,766
Whatever you say, coach.

712
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,369
I gotta go.

713
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:17,797
Okay, Skyler, girl.
I see you.

714
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:20,465
Well done, everyone.
Nice rehearsal.

715
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:27,840
Oh, my God. That girl in
that video was not all that.

716
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,474
- She don't look better than me though.
- Skyler?

717
00:40:29,476 --> 00:40:30,875
Skyler.

718
00:40:30,877 --> 00:40:34,048
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Oh, sure.

719
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:37,051
Close the door.

720
00:40:43,824 --> 00:40:46,692
I see you've
got some new moves.

721
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:51,596
I wasn't tryin' to show off, Miss J.
I really wasn't.

722
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:53,132
Well, where'd you
learn those moves?

723
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:55,601
Or did they just
come to you?

724
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:57,570
No, I've been working
with a friend.

725
00:40:57,572 --> 00:40:59,904
He's been showin' me
some of his moves.

726
00:40:59,906 --> 00:41:02,141
Yeah, well, I saw you
on the security cam.

727
00:41:02,143 --> 00:41:05,511
Looked like he was showin'
you more than just moves.

728
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:07,982
It's not what it looked like.
Honestly.

729
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:12,650
Look, Skyler, I don't want you
messin' with the likes of that boy.

730
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:14,152
He's trouble.

731
00:41:14,154 --> 00:41:17,088
I know he look a little rough,
but he's really not like that.

732
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,159
I think I have a pretty good
idea of what he's like.

733
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:21,960
He's my son.

734
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:24,963
- What?
- Look, I don't want you to take this wrong

735
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:27,500
because you are
a beautiful young woman,

736
00:41:27,502 --> 00:41:32,741
but the reason Tyrell is involved
with you is to get back at me.

737
00:41:34,674 --> 00:41:38,143
But I don't...
I don't understand.

738
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:40,579
We haven't spoken
in the past two years.

739
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,014
Messing with one of my dancers
is another of his games.

740
00:41:43,016 --> 00:41:45,753
So if you don't want to be
played, stay away from him.

741
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:48,422
But what happened?

742
00:41:50,157 --> 00:41:52,056
I've said more
than I want to.

743
00:41:52,058 --> 00:41:54,128
- But I just...
- I'll see you in rehearsal tomorrow.

744
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:17,618
Babe, what's goin' on?

745
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,855
Nothin's up. I'm just...
not in the mood.

746
00:42:23,857 --> 00:42:26,157
- What's on your mind?
- Too much.

747
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,992
I'm just, like...

748
00:42:27,994 --> 00:42:31,596
Everything is just
so stressful with work and...

749
00:42:31,598 --> 00:42:34,699
Rehearsals with Pulsar,
and my mom is still on my back

750
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:37,536
about this medical
assistant's course.

751
00:42:37,538 --> 00:42:40,206
It's just annoying.
I'm over it.

752
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,476
Come here, baby.
Come here.

753
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,712
Just take it
one day at a time,

754
00:42:46,714 --> 00:42:49,248
and everything
will be okay.

755
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,052
- I guess.
- You worry too much. You know that?

756
00:42:53,054 --> 00:42:55,956
As long as everything's okay
with you and me, it's all good.

757
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,795
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

758
00:43:11,906 --> 00:43:15,940
I do think you should listen to your mom
about that medical assistant job though.

759
00:43:15,942 --> 00:43:19,677
It pays more than minimum wage.
It's a great job.

760
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,114
Damn, Luke!

761
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:24,650
- What, baby?
- It was just gettin' good!

762
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:26,585
What?

763
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:29,521
Sk... Sky,
where you goin'?

764
00:43:53,581 --> 00:43:55,179
Hey.

765
00:43:55,181 --> 00:43:57,049
Hey!

766
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,918
- What?
- You don't answer my phone calls.

767
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,087
Why all the shade, Sky?

768
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:06,025
The shade is that
I spoke to your mother.

769
00:44:06,027 --> 00:44:08,994
- You didn't think I would find out?
- I wasn't hiding anything.

770
00:44:08,996 --> 00:44:11,697
Look, it's gettin' busy in here,
so you want somethin' or not?

771
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:14,166
How 'bout you just come to
the studio after you're done

772
00:44:14,168 --> 00:44:16,067
and let me explain
everything, please.

773
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:18,103
Look, I'll come by
to your studio,

774
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:20,275
but you better not
be wasting my time.

788
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:25,103
Since I can remember, my mom
resented me for a bunch of reasons.

789
00:45:25,105 --> 00:45:26,975
I still don't know why.

790
00:45:30,877 --> 00:45:34,079
Maybe it's because when she
threw my father out the house,

791
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:36,084
she was forced
to raise me alone.

792
00:45:37,784 --> 00:45:40,721
That didn't help her chances
of becoming a dancer.

793
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:44,223
We used to always fight.

794
00:45:44,225 --> 00:45:47,692
When I was 16 years old,
I decided to quit school

795
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:49,997
and get involved into
the underground club scene.

796
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:54,666
So, she decided
to do tough love

797
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:58,936
and said if I got kicked outta
school, if I ever quit,

798
00:45:58,938 --> 00:46:00,938
I had to move out.

799
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,243
So I did.

800
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,281
Maybe I'm as stubborn
as she is.

801
00:46:08,715 --> 00:46:10,882
I don't know if any of this
is makin' sense.

802
00:46:10,884 --> 00:46:13,719
Trust me.

803
00:46:13,721 --> 00:46:17,021
I definitely feel
where you coming from.

804
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:20,858
The only hope in life my mom
sees for me is drawing blood.

805
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,262
And waste all your talent?

806
00:46:23,264 --> 00:46:25,096
That's crazy.

807
00:46:25,098 --> 00:46:29,168
Your mom said that you were
using me to get back at her.

808
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:31,770
She would say that.

809
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:33,806
So when I told you
I was with Pulsar,

810
00:46:33,808 --> 00:46:35,940
why didn't you
just tell me then?

811
00:46:35,942 --> 00:46:38,076
I wanted you
to get to know me first.

812
00:46:38,078 --> 00:46:40,145
I would've told you
I was Jada's son,

813
00:46:40,147 --> 00:46:42,884
you would've looked at me
differently.

814
00:46:43,851 --> 00:46:45,186
I guess.

815
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,954
Whatever
my mom tell you,

816
00:46:49,956 --> 00:46:51,824
know I'm not
playin' games with you.

817
00:46:51,826 --> 00:46:54,025
I'm not lyin'.

818
00:46:54,027 --> 00:46:58,032
I'd like more, but as long as we
can dance together, I'm good.

819
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:35,300
Girl, you made Maya
work for that one.

820
00:47:35,302 --> 00:47:37,469
I was just trying
to keep up with her.

821
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,771
I would not let it
go to your head.

822
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,875
And you know I was bein'
easy on all y'all.

823
00:47:42,877 --> 00:47:45,543
I just don't want Miss J
all up in my face.

824
00:47:45,545 --> 00:47:48,447
Okay. Anyways, some of us are goin'
to the club tonight. You gonna come?

825
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,949
Oh, my God. Y'all always
goin' to the club.

826
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,050
- Yeah.
- Yeah, girl.

827
00:47:53,052 --> 00:47:54,987
All right. I'm in.

828
00:48:36,197 --> 00:48:38,596
- Hey, Tyrell.
- Hey.

829
00:48:38,598 --> 00:48:41,032
Tyrell, this is
my boyfriend Luke.

830
00:48:41,034 --> 00:48:43,201
Luke, Tyrell.

831
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:45,539
- Nice meetin' you.
- How do you know Skyler?

832
00:48:46,906 --> 00:48:48,440
Tyrell's her private
dance teacher.

833
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:50,942
I didn't know that you were
taking private dance lessons.

834
00:48:50,944 --> 00:48:52,376
How you think
she got this good?

835
00:48:52,378 --> 00:48:55,079
Obviously, I need to be
over there taking lessons.

836
00:48:55,081 --> 00:48:58,349
Anytime. I just came over to say you
look good on the dance floor tonight.

837
00:48:58,351 --> 00:49:01,253
Those dance lessons
payin' off.

838
00:49:01,255 --> 00:49:02,423
Nice meetin' you.

839
00:49:04,324 --> 00:49:06,491
So, how long you been taking
private lessons with this guy?

840
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:09,360
- A few weeks.
- Why wouldn't you tell me anything about that?

841
00:49:09,362 --> 00:49:12,331
Do I have to tell you
everything that I'm doing?

842
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:14,366
No, but if we're
gonna have trust...

843
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,335
You don't even want me dancin', so why do
you care about what lessons I'm takin'?

844
00:49:17,337 --> 00:49:18,904
- Uh, Sis.
- What?

845
00:49:18,906 --> 00:49:21,206
- The competition just got here.
- Who are they?

846
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,909
That's the crew we supposed to be goin'
up against in Ultimate Dance World.

847
00:49:23,911 --> 00:49:27,112
- Wait, I know her.
- You know who?

848
00:49:27,114 --> 00:49:30,282
Remember when I told you I got my
ass whupped in that dance battle?

849
00:49:30,284 --> 00:49:32,083
- Yes, I do.
- That's her.

850
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:33,619
- You went up against Eva, Sky?
- Yes.

851
00:49:33,621 --> 00:49:35,353
That's Atmasphere's
best dancer.

852
00:49:35,355 --> 00:49:37,255
Well, well, well.

853
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:39,891
- Hey, Eva.
- Hey, girl.

854
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:43,228
So, you didn't come
to check out the competition?

855
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,463
I mean, if we were, I guess
we'd have to go home early,

856
00:49:45,465 --> 00:49:47,666
'cause looks like
I don't see any here.

857
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:49,500
Yo, she funny.

858
00:49:49,502 --> 00:49:52,570
- Super funny.
- I guess you ain't lost your sense of humor

859
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:56,909
after we beat you
for a... third time in a row.

860
00:49:56,911 --> 00:50:00,545
If you keep living in the past, the future's
gonna sneak up and bite you in your little ass.

861
00:50:00,547 --> 00:50:02,547
Oh, this big ass
right here?

862
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:04,416
Your little...
I don't see anything.

863
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,183
- No, you see it. Thank you.
- Oh, that little thing?

864
00:50:06,185 --> 00:50:08,021
- We're gonna catch you later.
- Bye.

though, the energy's kind of wack.

Why do you have to be
so nasty?

876
00:50:40,154 --> 00:50:42,420

00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,694
She's the only thing keeping
you from beating Pulsar.

She won't be
at Pulsar forever.

881
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,730
Tell me about it.

882
00:50:52,732 --> 00:50:54,733
The way things are going
between her and Jada,

883
00:50:54,735 --> 00:50:57,501
she's ready
to walk out tomorrow.

884
00:50:57,503 --> 00:50:58,538
Really?

885
00:50:59,672 --> 00:51:01,540
Jada's holding her back.

886
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:04,244
She wants to be on a crew
that lets her do her own thing.

887
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:09,081
And why are you
telling me this?

888
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:10,518
I'm just trying
to be helpful.

889
00:51:14,188 --> 00:51:15,753
With Maya gone,

890
00:51:15,755 --> 00:51:17,424
you'd have a shot
at replacing her.

891
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,028
Is that right?

892
00:51:21,194 --> 00:51:22,330

I'm sorry. I just can't help

keep throwing at us, Miss J.

have time for your drama today.

910
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,980
I quit.
How's that for drama?

Ooh. Yeah.

961
00:55:01,748 --> 00:55:04,282
- What up, Sha?
- Girl, I didn't even see you come in.

962
00:55:04,284 --> 00:55:07,686
What you doin' here so early? I thought you went to the mall.

963
00:55:07,688 --> 00:55:09,987
I did. But I
finished up early, so.

964
00:55:09,989 --> 00:55:13,625
I would've came earlier, but of course
I had to listen to Mom's lecture.

965
00:55:13,627 --> 00:55:15,893
I think she tryin' to help. I don't
think she's tryin' to hurt you.

966
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,829
Yeah, whatever.

967
00:55:17,831 --> 00:55:20,532
She don't even think we gonna
win now that we lost Maya.

968
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:22,634
Girl, I hope
she's not right.

969
00:55:22,636 --> 00:55:24,936
- Not you too. Come on.
- I know.

970
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:28,239
I'm just sayin'. Maya was the
best dancer we had on this crew.

971
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:32,009
I watched y'all go head-to-head,
toe-to-toe. You can hold your own.

972
00:55:32,011 --> 00:55:35,413
- Hold my own like I could run this crew?
- Yeah.

973
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,715
And you don't have your eye
on being Jada's number one?

974
00:55:37,717 --> 00:55:40,451
Look, I already told you. I'm cool
with just being down with the crew.

975
00:55:40,453 --> 00:55:41,820
Bitch, you lyin'.

976
00:55:41,822 --> 00:55:43,355
All right,
maybe it might've...

977
00:55:43,357 --> 00:55:45,357
it might've ran through
my mind couple times.

978
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,659
But I mean, who wouldn't
want to do a solo?

979
00:55:47,661 --> 00:55:50,328
Shoot, I wanna do
the solo, obviously.

980
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:52,596
Yeah, obviously. but if
you wanna do that solo,

981
00:55:52,598 --> 00:55:54,532
you gonna need
to get that right.

982
00:55:54,534 --> 00:55:56,034
I'm not even
gonna hold you up.

983
00:55:56,036 --> 00:56:00,438
Your hip was just going
way too far forward.

984
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,373
Okay, so you
giving me tips?

985
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,977
You know, I do what I can.

986
00:56:05,344 --> 00:56:07,279
Man, y'all are
making us look bad,

987
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,612
always showing up early.

988
00:56:08,614 --> 00:56:10,047
Like seriously, stop, okay?

989
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:12,384
That's how
they make you look bad.

990
00:56:12,386 --> 00:56:14,018
Oh, God.
Man, whatever, Randy.

991
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,619
You better watch your back,
okay, bro?

992
00:56:15,621 --> 00:56:17,588
Ha.

993
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:21,925
Hey. What's up with your sister?
She's in some kind of mood today.

994
00:56:21,927 --> 00:56:25,663
Yeah, well, with the competition coming and
no Maya, I think we're all a little stressed.

995
00:56:25,665 --> 00:56:27,866
- Right?
- Maya was and is overrated.

996
00:56:27,868 --> 00:56:29,933
We can still win this, okay?

997
00:56:29,935 --> 00:56:32,404
- As long as Jada picks the right person for the solo.
- You mean you?

998
00:56:32,406 --> 00:56:34,371
Why not?

999
00:56:34,373 --> 00:56:36,708
Although I hear somebody's been taking
private lessons with Jada's son.

1000
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:38,576
He's just been showin' me
some dance moves.

1001
00:56:38,578 --> 00:56:41,413
Good for you. Men have been
getting some on the side forever.

1002
00:56:41,415 --> 00:56:43,748
I'm not getting anything
on the side.

1003
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,849
- Seriously, I'm not.
- Okay.

1004
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:48,255
Enough talk. Let's get to work, people.
Let's go. Let's go.

1005
00:57:20,853 --> 00:57:21,985
Come on.
We're going again.

1006
00:57:35,101 --> 00:57:38,004
Yeah, give me that attitude.
Let me see it in your face. Yes!

1007
00:57:38,971 --> 00:57:40,538
Hit this hard. Hit it hard.

1008
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,476
Up, down. Yes.

1009
00:57:48,614 --> 00:57:50,547
Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

1010
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:55,453
Not bad. It's not bad.

1011
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,922
Uh, why y'all all sucking wind like
you about to take your last breath?

1012
00:57:58,924 --> 00:58:01,659
Dance World
is in two weeks, people.

1013
00:58:01,661 --> 00:58:04,094
I don't want to see
any gasping onstage.

1014
00:58:04,096 --> 00:58:07,632
Tomorrow I am going to decide on
who gets the solo.

1015
00:58:07,634 --> 00:58:09,867
So come in prepared
to show me what you got.

1016
00:58:09,869 --> 00:58:12,440
All right, that's it. Get your
lazy bones out of my studio.

1017
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:17,409
Is it just me, or is Miss J
gettin' hard on us?

1018
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,944
Girl, it is not just you.

1019
00:58:19,946 --> 00:58:23,484
She always gets like this when competition
comes around. Girl, she is tryin' to win.

1020
00:58:24,951 --> 00:58:26,587
We all just tryin' to win.

1021
00:58:27,686 --> 00:58:29,420
Oh, I meant to tell you.

1022
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,623
I'm going to this underground
battle at Lifted with Tyrell.

1023
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:33,023
You want to come?

1024
00:58:33,025 --> 00:58:36,027
Is this another one of your,
um, your not-a-date dates?

1025
00:58:36,029 --> 00:58:39,730
- Forget I asked, Tosha.
- Wait, I'm just playin'. You know I can't come.

1026
00:58:39,732 --> 00:58:42,199
That dude I was telling you about who's
always hooking me up with clothes?

1027
00:58:42,201 --> 00:58:46,036
I gotta go Netflix and chill with
him, act like I like his black ass.

1028
00:58:46,038 --> 00:58:49,072
- -But first I'm hitting
Zesto's with the crew, so...

1029
00:58:49,074 --> 00:58:50,175
Well, have fun.

1030
00:58:50,177 --> 00:58:52,177
Thank you. I love you.

1031
00:58:52,179 --> 00:58:53,514
Love you too.

1032
00:58:57,551 --> 00:59:00,184
Mmm, this shake
is everything!

1033
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:04,188
Yeah, and this is coming from the
guy who literally eats everything.

1034
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:06,090
- So, what's up, Tosh?
- What?

1035
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:08,896
You, uh... You gonna let me get some
clothes from your "friend" tonight?

1036
00:59:10,496 --> 00:59:12,630
- From my "friend"?
- Yeah, your friend.

1037
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,065
I don't think he will be cool with
me getting another guy clothes,

1038
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:18,001
but if you need a crop
top, sir, I'm your girl.

1039
00:59:18,003 --> 00:59:20,572
Hey, Randy, that might
be a good look for you.

1040
00:59:20,574 --> 00:59:22,176
- Like for real. No shade.
- I agree.

1041
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:25,576
- Hey, Tosha. What's up, guys?
- Hey, Luke.

1042
00:59:25,578 --> 00:59:26,911
- What's up?
- What are y'all up to?

1043
00:59:26,913 --> 00:59:28,612
- Chillin'.
- French fries.

1044
00:59:28,614 --> 00:59:30,882
- No practice today?
- Eatin'.

1045
00:59:30,884 --> 00:59:33,016
We finished practice
about an hour ago.

1046
00:59:33,018 --> 00:59:35,753
Oh. Where's Sky? Isn't she
part of the crew now?

1047
00:59:35,755 --> 00:59:37,688
That she is.

1048
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:41,092
But she's getting ready to go to
that underground club thing tonight.

1049
00:59:41,094 --> 00:59:42,994
Oh. She didn't mention
anything to me.

1050
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,063
She said she was gonna
ask you to go,

1051
00:59:45,065 --> 00:59:47,030
but that's not really
your scene, she says.

1052
00:59:47,032 --> 00:59:49,067
Yeah. Yeah.
I guess that's true.

1053
00:59:49,069 --> 00:59:51,569
I think she just decided
to go with Tyrell instead.

1054
00:59:51,571 --> 00:59:54,875
So they gonna go and try to see
what's hot, check out some moves.

1055
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,543
Just her and Tyrell?

1056
00:59:58,545 --> 01:00:01,746
I mean, we were all too tired from
practice to go, but you know Sky.

1057
01:00:01,748 --> 01:00:03,884
She gonna take this dance thing
to the next level.

1058
01:00:05,252 --> 01:00:07,050
Yeah, I know Sky.

1059
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:09,987
Um, you don't happen to know
where that club's at, do you?

1060
01:00:09,989 --> 01:00:11,989
Yeah, actually, I do.

1061
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:14,092
- You know, it's Lifted.
- Mmm.

1062
01:00:14,094 --> 01:00:16,793
Yeah, it's 409 Eighth Street.

1063
01:00:16,795 --> 01:00:18,862
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

1064
01:00:18,864 --> 01:00:21,099
Okay, cool. I'll catch up
with you guys later then.

1065
01:00:21,101 --> 01:00:22,800
- Yeah, sure. -Later, man.
- Peace, man.

1066
01:00:22,802 --> 01:00:24,869
Tell her I said not to come
home too late, please?

1067
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,770
- Okay, I will.
- Thank you.

1068
01:00:26,772 --> 01:00:28,007
- See you, guys.
- See you, man.

1069
01:00:31,944 --> 01:00:33,545
- You threw that?
- Threw what?

1070
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,246
- So you don't want the crop top then?
- All right.

1122
01:03:14,107 --> 01:03:16,174
- Yo, you need to chill out, man.
- Am I talking to you?

1123
01:03:16,176 --> 01:03:18,041
Luke, back off.
Nothin' happened.

1124
01:03:18,043 --> 01:03:20,244
No, just dancing, right? Isn't
that what you said? Just dancing?

1125
01:03:20,246 --> 01:03:23,313
For once she's doing what she likes.
So get to steppin', man.

1126
01:03:23,315 --> 01:03:25,282
I'm talking to my girl, dude.

1127
01:03:25,284 --> 01:03:28,886
She's her own woman, and from the
looks of it, she don't want you.

1128
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,255
- Just get outta here.
- Let me tell ya something, you little broke-ass punk.

1129
01:03:31,257 --> 01:03:33,824
I don't dance, but if you wanna step outside,
I'll show you what a real battle is.

1130
01:03:33,826 --> 01:03:35,328
All right, that's enough.

1131
01:03:38,931 --> 01:03:41,734
- -You know what? That is enough.
Come on. Let's go.

1132
01:03:43,268 --> 01:03:45,369
- Are you coming or what?
- You can't come up in here

1133
01:03:45,371 --> 01:03:47,337
and drag me out
like you own me.

1134
01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:50,443
Know what, Sky?
Enjoy your new life.

1135
01:03:53,045 --> 01:03:54,915
Buh-bye!

1136
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,469
Look, I'm sorry about what
happened at the club tonight, Sky.

1137
01:04:17,936 --> 01:04:19,139
It's not your fault.

1138
01:04:21,473 --> 01:04:23,142
So we cool?

1139
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:25,878
Yeah, we cool.

1140
01:04:37,257 --> 01:04:39,556
- Damn!
- What?

1141
01:04:39,558 --> 01:04:41,793
Skyler, where have you been
hiding these moves?

1142
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,195
- I gotta give it up to you. That's just dope.
- What are you guys talking about?

1143
01:04:44,197 --> 01:04:47,931
- Yeah.
- You got it, flaunt it.

1144
01:04:47,933 --> 01:04:50,268
Damn, you blowin' up
all over the Web.

1145
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,170
Come on. 20,000 hits
in two hours, Sky.

1146
01:04:52,172 --> 01:04:54,371
- Who does that?
- This is crazy.

1147
01:04:54,373 --> 01:04:56,409
- Who posted it though?
- Like, half the kids in the club.

1148
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:58,878
That was ill.

1149
01:05:00,145 --> 01:05:02,813
- I was just following Tyrell.
- Come on, girl.

1150
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,549
You schooled that boy.
He's got nothing on you.

1151
01:05:04,551 --> 01:05:06,918
Looks to me like Jada
has her new soloist.

1152
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,085
I wouldn't be so sure.

1153
01:05:09,087 --> 01:05:12,088
When she sees this
video, she won't have a choice.

1154
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:14,090
Yeah, she's also gonna see
I'm dancing with Tyrell.

1155
01:05:14,092 --> 01:05:16,527
Miss J wants to win just
as much as the rest of us.

1156
01:05:16,529 --> 01:05:18,596
She's gonna come around fast enough.

1157
01:05:18,598 --> 01:05:20,864
- Oh...
- Did you see this?

1158
01:05:20,866 --> 01:05:22,900
Oh, I knew y'all
would be here celebrating.

1159
01:05:22,902 --> 01:05:24,501
I'm not celebrating
though.

1160
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:27,137
- I'd be if I were you.
- It was just a dance battle.

1161
01:05:27,139 --> 01:05:29,340
Your sister is dope.

1162
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,141
We all think
she be dancing the solo.

1163
01:05:31,143 --> 01:05:33,412
Y'all think Miss J gonna have
somethin' to say about it?

1164
01:05:39,219 --> 01:05:41,418
What are you
gonna major in?

1165
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:45,322
Uh... Shit, I don't know.
Politics, maybe?

1166
01:05:45,324 --> 01:05:47,991
Politics? What do you know
about politics?

1167
01:05:47,993 --> 01:05:49,393
Hey, down there.
Chill out.

1168
01:05:49,395 --> 01:05:51,362
What about you?
What are you gonna study?

1169
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,998
Uh, I always wanted to be
an animal doctor.

1170
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,534
- "Animal doctor"? You mean, uh, a vet?
- Yeah.

1171
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,536
- He means a vet.
- Yes, a vet.

1172
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:01,471
Why not just be a human doctor?
Probably takes just as long.

1173
01:06:01,473 --> 01:06:03,608
I like animals better.

1174
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:06,210
That explains a lot. Right?

1175
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,945
Okay, whoa, man.
I'm keeping this.

1176
01:06:07,947 --> 01:06:09,380
- Hey, guys.
- Good color.

1177
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:12,315
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, what's up?

1178
01:06:12,317 --> 01:06:16,186
We were just talking about what we're
gonna do when we win that scholarship.

1179
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:17,520
- 'Sup?
- Okay.

1180
01:06:17,522 --> 01:06:20,023
You all feel like we
about to win this, huh?

1181
01:06:20,025 --> 01:06:24,996
If you think about it and seen Skyler was goin'
dong stupid in the club the other night.

1182
01:06:24,998 --> 01:06:27,030
- I think we got a good chance.
- I hope so.

1183
01:06:27,032 --> 01:06:30,333
'Cause I just want to be able to say
that I'm a college graduate, you know?

1184
01:06:30,335 --> 01:06:32,335
Okay, so what
we doing here?

1185
01:06:32,337 --> 01:06:35,005
We having a slumber party or
dance rehearsal? What's goin'...

1186
01:06:35,007 --> 01:06:37,108
We're just talking about
winning that scholarship.

1187
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:39,576
Oh, well, I'm happy to see
everybody's feeling so confident.

1188
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:41,447
Yeah, well, with Skyler
doing the solo, we can't lose.

1189
01:06:43,116 --> 01:06:45,683
What makes you think
Skyler's doing the solo?

1190
01:06:45,685 --> 01:06:48,451
- Didn't you see the video of her dancing?
- As a matter of fact, I did.

1191
01:06:48,453 --> 01:06:52,290
Which is why I am not putting
her in the solo. Sorry, Skyler.

1192
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:53,627
You can't be
serious though, right?

1193
01:06:56,228 --> 01:06:59,429
It's my decision to make.
So, yes, I am serious.

1194
01:06:59,431 --> 01:07:03,300
I'm not trying to do
the solo for me.

1195
01:07:03,302 --> 01:07:08,371
Everybody who's seen the video of me
dancin' says that I could beat Maya.

1196
01:07:08,373 --> 01:07:11,976
I also saw the video, which is
why I'm not giving you the solo.

1197
01:07:11,978 --> 01:07:14,578
Wait. I'm... I'm confused.

1198
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:18,648
Okay, well, just because you can shake
your booty you think you're a real dancer.

1199
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:22,052
But the kind of dance you do does
not represent the style of dance

1200
01:07:22,054 --> 01:07:25,088
that Honey Studio
stands for.

1201
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:29,326
Okay. It's called hip-hop,
and that's what I was doing.

1202
01:07:29,328 --> 01:07:33,197
Okay. You can call what
you do whatever you want.

1203
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:35,199
But I call it
cheap exhibitionism,

1204
01:07:35,201 --> 01:07:38,268
and your teammates will see that too
once they have time to compare that

1205
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:41,137
to what we do here.

1206
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:42,241
- But I...
- Ah.

1207
01:07:47,212 --> 01:07:49,515
Dante, let's warm
everybody up, huh?

1208
01:07:53,185 --> 01:07:55,421
All right, guys.
Spread out.

1209
01:07:56,556 --> 01:07:58,592
- Sorry, Sky.
- Miss J.

1210
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,228
- You just trying to get back at your son.
- What?

1211
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:06,063
You don't want him
to get any credit

1212
01:08:06,065 --> 01:08:08,666
for everything he's been teaching
me that you've never seen before.

1213
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:10,400
Let's leave Tyrell
out of this.

1214
01:08:10,402 --> 01:08:12,171
Right, 'cause leaving Tyrell out
is easy for you, huh?

1215
01:08:13,406 --> 01:08:15,072
What's that
supposed to mean?

1216
01:08:15,074 --> 01:08:17,440
It's supposed to mean putting
your son out in the streets

1217
01:08:17,442 --> 01:08:19,510
because he dropped out
of school?

1218
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,579
- That's cold.
- Whoa, Tyrell didn't drop out of school.

1219
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:25,783
He was kicked out
for fighting and dealing drugs.

1220
01:08:25,785 --> 01:08:29,019
And I didn't throw him
on the street.

1221
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:31,354
The judge put him in a group
home, and when he was released,

1222
01:08:31,356 --> 01:08:34,225
he chose not to
come back home.

1223
01:08:34,227 --> 01:08:36,229
Not that I was
in a hurry to have him back.

1224
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,473
You forgot
your water... bottle.

1225
01:08:52,145 --> 01:08:54,110
Has everything
you told me been a lie?

1226
01:08:54,112 --> 01:08:55,712
I want you
to get to know me, Sky.

1227
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,747
Dealin' drugs?

1228
01:08:57,749 --> 01:09:00,283
It was stupid. I got caught.
I haven't done it in two years.

1229
01:09:00,285 --> 01:09:03,354
You can't build a relationship
based off of lies, Tyrell.

1230
01:09:03,356 --> 01:09:06,122
Do you know what it's like
to have nobody believe in you?

1231
01:09:06,124 --> 01:09:07,725
That's been me
my whole life.

1232
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:10,728
Do you know how badly I want somebody
in my life to believe in me?

1233
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,462
Support my ambition?

1234
01:09:12,464 --> 01:09:13,632
I believe in you.

1235
01:09:16,302 --> 01:09:19,170
Look. I want somebody
that I can trust.

1236
01:09:19,172 --> 01:09:21,375
And right now,
that trust is broken.

1253
01:11:07,746 --> 01:11:11,649
So you could gloat about how you got one of my
girls all twisted with your sad and made-up story?

1254
01:11:11,651 --> 01:11:13,551
Me and Skyler
had something real.

1255
01:11:13,553 --> 01:11:15,685
- But then you had to mess it up like always?
- No.

1256
01:11:15,687 --> 01:11:17,854
You did that to yourself
by lying to her.

1257
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:20,292
- Why you hate me?
- Is that what you really believe?

1258
01:11:21,727 --> 01:11:24,295
Tyrell, I brought you
into this world.

1259
01:11:24,297 --> 01:11:28,299
I worked hard,
passed on opportunities,

1260
01:11:28,301 --> 01:11:30,367
to provide for you.

1261
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:33,871
So why don't you add that you
resent me because of that?

1262
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:36,207
That's not true.

1263
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,908
And why you was
never there to be a mom.

1264
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:39,579
Is it because
I look like Pops?

1265
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:44,650
I bet when you wanted to throw him
out, you wanted to throw me out too.

1266
01:11:47,852 --> 01:11:51,157
When I met your father,
I thought he was a good man.

1267
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:55,262
He had ambition and dreams.

1268
01:11:58,496 --> 01:12:01,864
But when things didn't go his
way, he started using drugs.

1269
01:12:01,866 --> 01:12:05,301
When he couldn't afford those
drugs, he started dealing.

1270
01:12:05,303 --> 01:12:10,373
So, no, I was not gonna let my son be
put in danger because of his choices.

1271
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:13,946
That's why I tossed him out.
To protect you.

1272
01:12:16,781 --> 01:12:20,619
But how was I supposed to know you was gonna
end up in the same patch as your father?

1273
01:12:23,623 --> 01:12:24,590
I'm sorry.

1274
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:28,926
I shouldn't have said that.

1275
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:32,028
Nah, you just tellin' me
what I need to hear.

1276
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:33,832
But, Mom, if you're never
gonna forgive me,

1277
01:12:35,034 --> 01:12:36,703
don't take it out
on Skyler.

01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,561
I'm sorry to say that Tosha's
not here at the moment.

1298
01:13:38,563 --> 01:13:40,863
You know, actually,
I was hoping to talk to Skyler.

1299
01:13:40,865 --> 01:13:43,502
Oh. Sure. She's in her room.
I'll get her.

1300
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,440
- Skyler?
- I heard the doorbell.

1301
01:13:51,877 --> 01:13:53,743
Hi.

1302
01:13:53,745 --> 01:13:55,414
What's goin' on?

1303
01:13:58,484 --> 01:14:01,417
Well...

1304
01:14:01,419 --> 01:14:04,990
Tyrell was right. I shouldn't punish
you for what's going on between us.

1305
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:09,359
- He said that?
- Yeah.

1306
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:12,796
He did. That's
actually why I'm here.

1307
01:14:12,798 --> 01:14:15,733
I want you to do
the one-on-one battle.

1308
01:14:15,735 --> 01:14:16,899
But-But I thought...

1309
01:14:16,901 --> 01:14:20,738
Never mind what I said.
I... I was wrong.

1310
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,905
So I'm asking you,
will you be our soloist?

1311
01:14:22,907 --> 01:14:24,774
I...

1312
01:14:24,776 --> 01:14:27,411
The answer
is no.

1313
01:14:27,413 --> 01:14:30,514
Skyler's already applied to school so she
could get her medical assistant's certificate

1314
01:14:30,516 --> 01:14:31,814
and get
a good-paying job.

1315
01:14:31,816 --> 01:14:34,150
Wow, that was fast.

1316
01:14:34,152 --> 01:14:38,555
Do you even have an interest
in medicine, or is...

1317
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,922
Hey, Miss J.

1318
01:14:39,924 --> 01:14:41,158
Hi, Tosha.

1319
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,493
Just stopped by
to talk to Skyler.

1320
01:14:43,495 --> 01:14:45,764
- What's goin' on?
- She wants Skyler to dance the solo.

1321
01:14:47,031 --> 01:14:48,866
Congratulations.

1322
01:14:48,868 --> 01:14:52,668
I know I was harsh the other day, but...
I've come to my senses.

1323
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:53,740
And so has Skyler.

1324
01:14:55,473 --> 01:14:56,842
Are you sure about this?

1325
01:14:58,009 --> 01:14:59,579
I promised her I would do it.

1326
01:15:00,879 --> 01:15:02,712
I'm sorry you came
all this way

1327
01:15:02,714 --> 01:15:05,616
just to get an answer you weren't
looking for, but I know my Skyler.

1328
01:15:05,618 --> 01:15:09,789
And when she's made up her mind,
that's that. Right, honey?

1329
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:13,727
Understood. Well,
then I should be leaving.

1330
01:15:15,727 --> 01:15:16,995
We are gonna miss you.

1331
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:23,934
If you change your mind, I have to decide
on who's doing the solo by tomorrow.

1332
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,036
Sounds like she's already
made up her mind.

1333
01:15:26,038 --> 01:15:27,773
It was nice
seeing you again, April.

1334
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,774
You have two
very talented daughters.

1335
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:31,745
Thank you.

1336
01:15:33,212 --> 01:15:34,147
Two.

1337
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:43,921
Well, that was
mature of you.

1338
01:15:43,923 --> 01:15:45,721
What was, Tosha?

1339
01:15:45,723 --> 01:15:48,891
Turning down Miss J so you
could do something practical.

1340
01:15:48,893 --> 01:15:52,162
Yeah, that's me,
Miss Practical.

1341
01:15:52,164 --> 01:15:55,631
Well, it might've been a good decision,
because I think she was coming over here

1342
01:15:55,633 --> 01:15:57,701
because she felt guilty
about what happened with Tyrell.

1343
01:15:57,703 --> 01:15:59,869
Or maybe one of the reasons
why she came over here

1344
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,139
is she felt like I was
the better person for the solo.

1345
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:04,975
- You have to stop trying to compete with your sister.
- Maybe so. I...

1346
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,676
Compete?

1347
01:16:06,678 --> 01:16:08,578
Ain't no competition.

1348
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,814
You've clearly already picked
the winner from jump.

1349
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:14,518
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Look around here. You notice anything?

1350
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,589
How many pictures on the wall
does Mom have of you?

1351
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,123
- I don't know.
- Twenty.

1352
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:24,961
You wanna know how many of me? Three.
And two of 'em, you're in.

1353
01:16:24,963 --> 01:16:27,730
- Why are we doing this?
- That's just nonsense.

1354
01:16:27,732 --> 01:16:29,802
Nonsense? Really? Okay.

1355
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:34,136
I'm not here. I'm not here.
I'm not here.

1356
01:16:34,138 --> 01:16:36,239
I'm not here.
Oh, and this one right here?

1357
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:39,176
I was actually standing
right next to her,

1358
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,612
but for some reason,
I didn't make the picture.

1359
01:16:41,614 --> 01:16:45,084
Okay, now here we go with the dramatics.
And that chip on your shoulder.

1360
01:16:46,252 --> 01:16:48,851
You just really
don't get it.

1361
01:16:48,853 --> 01:16:52,922
Sky, Mom has worked hard all this time for
both of us. It hasn't just been for me.

1362
01:16:52,924 --> 01:16:55,658
It's always been easy
for you,

1363
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:59,796
because you get the better end
of the deal every single time.

1364
01:16:59,798 --> 01:17:01,968
Don't blame me
because I have talent, Sky.

1365
01:17:03,835 --> 01:17:04,803
Wow.

1366
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:09,238
You've really got her
brainwashed.

1367
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,742
You really got her
brainwashed.

1368
01:17:11,744 --> 01:17:14,744
And you really think
I don't have talent.

1369
01:17:14,746 --> 01:17:16,747
I didn't mean that, but...

1370
01:17:16,749 --> 01:17:19,181
I know what you meant.

1371
01:17:19,183 --> 01:17:22,185
Why share the limelight with your
sister if you don't have to?

1372
01:17:22,187 --> 01:17:24,186
- Okay. You know what? Stop.
- That has...

1373
01:17:24,188 --> 01:17:26,756
Stop. I'm not listening
to anymore of this.

1374
01:17:26,758 --> 01:17:28,792
You don't have to.

1375
01:17:28,794 --> 01:17:30,096
'Cause I made my decision.

1376
01:17:31,597 --> 01:17:33,132
You answered Miss J,
not me.

1377
01:17:35,633 --> 01:17:37,768
What are you doing?
Don't tear that up.

1378
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:39,739
You are throwing
everything away.

1379
01:17:40,638 --> 01:17:41,771
Cool.

1380
01:17:41,773 --> 01:17:43,873
And where are you going now?

1381
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:46,111
To let Jada know
that she has a solo dancer.

1382
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:56,720
How can you let that backstreet neophyte
nobody represent us at Dance World?

1383
01:17:56,722 --> 01:18:00,023
Girl, you better back it up.
You are shouting in my face.

1384
01:18:00,025 --> 01:18:02,693
I'm sorry. I just think
you're making a mistake.

1385
01:18:02,695 --> 01:18:04,060
Really?

1386
01:18:04,062 --> 01:18:06,063
With Maya gone, we need
our strongest dancer

1387
01:18:06,065 --> 01:18:08,966
to go head-to-head with her in the
battle, and that is not Skyler.

1388
01:18:08,968 --> 01:18:11,201
So just who do you
think it is, Nia?

1389
01:18:11,203 --> 01:18:13,336
I'm not saying this for my
sake, but for the whole team.

1390
01:18:13,338 --> 01:18:15,305
It should be me.

1391
01:18:15,307 --> 01:18:17,373
There's no doubt
you are one of my best dancers,

1392
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:19,275
but Skyler
brings something fresh,

1393
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:21,677
and we need that going up
against Maya in the battle.

1394
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:23,316
She knows all our moves.

1395
01:18:25,183 --> 01:18:26,716
It's your call.

1396
01:18:26,718 --> 01:18:28,784
Well, good. I'm glad
we at least agree on that.

1397
01:18:28,786 --> 01:18:31,089
- I didn't mean for it to sound like that.
- Uh-huh.

1398
01:18:33,758 --> 01:18:35,859
If it's any consolation,

1399
01:18:35,861 --> 01:18:38,831
I have added something to the routine
that's gonna feature you and Tosha.

1400
01:18:39,964 --> 01:18:41,567
- Really?
- Yes, really.

1401
01:19:03,755 --> 01:19:05,124
Huh.

1402
01:19:11,096 --> 01:19:13,700
- Atmasphere, bring it in, bring it in. Bring it in.
- Yes!

1403
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,100
That was dope.

1404
01:19:17,102 --> 01:19:19,970
We are so close
to winning Dance World.

1405
01:19:19,972 --> 01:19:22,709
If you all can bring it like
you did today, it's ours.

1406
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:27,743
Eva, the helicopter
was fire.

1407
01:19:27,745 --> 01:19:29,945
I want you to rock that
in the solo. Yeah?

1408
01:19:29,947 --> 01:19:31,982
- All right. I got you, Coach.
- All right.

1409
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:35,018
Everybody, take five. When we get
back, running the opening piece.

1410
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,720
Yeah?

1411
01:19:36,722 --> 01:19:38,721
- Hey, Derrick, can I talk to you for a second?
- Cool?

1412
01:19:38,723 --> 01:19:40,857
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Okay.

1413
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:44,327
So, you told Eva to do the
helicopter in the solo.

1414
01:19:44,329 --> 01:19:46,863
Oh, yeah. I think
the helicopter works.

1415
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:49,032
I know it does. I'm the one
who came up with the move.

1416
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,201
And you told me I was doin' the solo.
What's up with that?

1417
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:54,136
I didn't mean for it to come out like that, okay?

1418
01:19:54,138 --> 01:19:57,207
- I changed my mind, and I was gonna tell you...
- Really? When?

1419
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,810
When it was too late for me to change
my mind and go back to Pulsar?

1420
01:19:59,812 --> 01:20:01,978
Why would you do that?
We got a winning crew.

1421
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:05,284
The only reason why you have a chance of
beating Pulsar is because I'm not on the team.

1422
01:20:07,151 --> 01:20:10,019
Damn. That's the only reason why
you recruited me, isn't it?

1423
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:11,387
What are you talking about?

1424
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:13,489
You never planned on
giving me the solo.

1425
01:20:13,491 --> 01:20:15,926
You just didn't want to have Eva
have to go up against me.

1426
01:20:15,928 --> 01:20:17,894
I would never do
something like that.

1427
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:19,996
- I'm only doing what I think is best for this crew.
- Really?

1428
01:20:19,998 --> 01:20:22,669
I'm gonna do the same.
I'm out of here, Derrick.

1429
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:32,509
<i>Ladies.</i>

1430
01:20:39,817 --> 01:20:40,786
<i>Fellas.</i>

1431
01:20:42,221 --> 01:20:44,123
Well, what a surprise.

1432
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:46,288
I got played.

1433
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:47,826
Really?

1434
01:20:51,062 --> 01:20:52,230
Everybody, take five.

1435
01:20:55,868 --> 01:20:58,167
Got played, huh?

1436
01:20:58,169 --> 01:21:02,171
I should've never allowed Nia to talk me into
going over to Atmasphere in the first place.

1437
01:21:02,173 --> 01:21:03,974
It was her idea.

1438
01:21:03,976 --> 01:21:05,975
Nia told me
she begged you to stay.

1439
01:21:05,977 --> 01:21:08,077
Begged?
Are you kidding me?

1440
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:10,012
She's been on my case.

1441
01:21:10,014 --> 01:21:12,515
On my case about
how you be disrespecting me,

1442
01:21:12,517 --> 01:21:15,051
telling me I need to man up
and speak my mind,

1443
01:21:15,053 --> 01:21:17,520
how I need
to not hold my tongue.

1444
01:21:17,522 --> 01:21:21,390
Well, damn, that sounds like the
exact line she's been feeding me.

1445
01:21:21,392 --> 01:21:22,958
It looks like
we both got played.

1446
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,229
Clearly. So...

1447
01:21:26,231 --> 01:21:29,235
does this mean
that I'm back on the team?

1448
01:21:30,268 --> 01:21:31,967
Eh.

1449
01:21:31,969 --> 01:21:33,202
Miss J.

1450
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:36,473
- Of course.
- Okay, yay.

1451
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:39,509
- But now, I have given the solo to Skyler.
- No, no, it's totally fine.

1452
01:21:39,511 --> 01:21:41,379
I just want to dance.
For Pulsar.

1453
01:21:43,382 --> 01:21:45,084
Come here.

1454
01:21:47,553 --> 01:21:50,487
- Welcome back.
- Thanks. Feels good to be home.

1455
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:52,322
Everybody,
listen up.

1456
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:56,059
I am happy to announce
that Maya is back on the team.

1457
01:22:00,164 --> 01:22:02,064
Thank God. We missed you.

1458
01:22:02,066 --> 01:22:04,201
- Does this mean she's doing the solo?
- No.

1459
01:22:04,203 --> 01:22:07,069
No, Skyler's still doing the solo,
but I have made a slight change.

1460
01:22:07,071 --> 01:22:10,607
I'm going to have Maya and Tosha
do the breakout routine.

1461
01:22:10,609 --> 01:22:13,109
- But that's my part.
- Not anymore.

1462
01:22:13,111 --> 01:22:15,979
- How can you do that? She wasn't even here...
- Nia, don't.

1463
01:22:15,981 --> 01:22:18,314
You have caused enough
trouble for a lifetime,

1464
01:22:18,316 --> 01:22:20,850
and if you think I haven't figured
out that you've been playing us,

1465
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:24,320
then you're an even
bigger fool than I was.

1466
01:22:24,322 --> 01:22:27,457
Now step back in that line before I change my
mind and give you what you really deserve.

1467
01:22:27,459 --> 01:22:28,427
Mmm.

1468
01:22:30,294 --> 01:22:31,897
Everybody,
places from the top.

1469
01:22:40,405 --> 01:22:42,404
<i>Coming to you live from Atlanta</i>

1470
01:22:42,406 --> 01:22:46,009
<i>for the 10th Annual
USA Dance World Competition.</i>

1471
01:22:46,011 --> 01:22:50,913
<i>Now, in just a few moments, this place
will be overflowing with thousands of fans</i>

1472
01:22:50,915 --> 01:22:53,216
<i>from far and wide for the competition.</i>

1473
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:55,952
I see you ran back
to your little crew.

1474
01:22:55,954 --> 01:22:57,887
- More like I came home.
- Mmm.

1475
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:00,256
I really hope I get to go up
against you in that solo battle.

1476
01:23:00,258 --> 01:23:02,958
Keep wishing.
I'm not even doing a solo.

1477
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,228
Then who is?

1478
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,029
She is.

1479
01:23:07,031 --> 01:23:10,233
I remember you.

1480
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:12,635
I whupped that ass in the club.

1481
01:23:12,637 --> 01:23:15,572
And Jada wants you
to go up against me?

1482
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:17,474
Is she tryin' to lose?

1483
01:23:17,476 --> 01:23:19,408
- Bye, Eva.
- Oh.

1484
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:21,443
- Good night.
- Round two? See you later?

1485
01:23:21,445 --> 01:23:23,179
- Bye.
- You want it again?

1486
01:23:23,181 --> 01:23:25,649
- Isn't camouflage a little last year?
- I think that red isn't in.

1487
01:23:25,651 --> 01:23:28,150
Nice outfits.

1488
01:23:28,152 --> 01:23:30,619
Can't stand that bitch.

1489
01:23:30,621 --> 01:23:33,256
Hey, don't let her get inside your head.
We're good. We're good.

1490
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:34,556
Forget about them.
Seriously.

1491
01:23:34,558 --> 01:23:37,127
You know, it's not too late
to back out now.

1492
01:23:37,129 --> 01:23:41,230
- What is your problem?
- Nia, go stretch. Seriously?

1493
01:23:41,232 --> 01:23:44,367
Okay, people, hundreds of crews
have competed for spots,

1494
01:23:44,369 --> 01:23:49,104
but only 20 teams were chosen to compete in
the sickest dance competition in the country.

1495
01:23:49,106 --> 01:23:52,007
Y'all ready to battle?
Let's go!

1496
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:58,774
Welcome to the stage Pulsar!

1497
01:25:12,057 --> 01:25:13,422
That's my daughter, Tosha.

1498
01:25:13,424 --> 01:25:15,457
She's amazing.

1499
01:25:15,459 --> 01:25:16,728
One, two...

1500
01:26:22,127 --> 01:26:23,129
That was sick.

Our judges

1529
01:27:53,552 --> 01:27:56,920
have narrowed down
the competition to four crews,

1530
01:27:56,922 --> 01:27:58,720
and they are:

1531
01:27:58,722 --> 01:28:00,323
Atmasphere!

1532
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,595
Hot Ice!

1533
01:28:10,602 --> 01:28:11,967

01:28:17,942 --> 01:28:20,376
Pulsar!

1536
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:21,743
Yo, I'm not even gonna lie.

1537
01:28:21,745 --> 01:28:23,680
Eva picked up some of my moves
while I was over there.

1538
01:28:23,682 --> 01:28:25,614
How am I supposed to beat
those moves?

1539
01:28:25,616 --> 01:28:27,884
Go out there and lay
your killer move on her.

1540
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,220
- What move is that?
- You know what I'm talkin' about.

1541
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:33,389
- The one Mom calls your chicken spaz attack. That one.
- Yeah.

1542
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:34,924
- Mom hates that.
- You've seen that before, right?

1543
01:28:34,926 --> 01:28:36,859
I don't care
if she hates that dance.

1544
01:28:36,861 --> 01:28:39,765
You go out there and take it to the
next level and win us this competition.

1545
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,966
- Are you sure?
- I am 100-percent positive.

1546
01:28:43,968 --> 01:28:46,368
This is your moment.
You got this.

1547
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:47,769
- Okay. Right.
- You got it.

1548
01:28:47,771 --> 01:28:49,838
Come on. Come on, come on.
You got it.

1549
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,241
You got it.
Close up, Sis.

1550
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:52,678
