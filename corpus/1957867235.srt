1
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:15,567
[foreboding music]

2
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:27,337
[911 Dispatcher] 911,
what's your emergency?

3
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:29,857
[Woman] We need
someone here immediately.

4
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:31,893
There are people, there
are a lot of people

5
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:33,309
trying to get into my house.

6
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:38,141
[911 Dispatcher] Okay,
how many people, ma'am?

7
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:39,384
[Woman] I don't know.

8
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:40,833
I don't know how many
people, they're just...

9
00:00:40,868 --> 00:00:42,352
I don't know.

10
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:44,872
[911 Dispatcher] Yeah, are
they inside the house, ma'am?

11
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:46,598
[Woman] No, we have
people inside the house.

12
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:47,461
There's about five of us.

13
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:49,014
You guys, where's Sean?

14
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,188
Where is Sean?

15
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:53,743
We need someone here.

16
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:56,366
[911 Dispatcher]
Okay, ma'am, I uh...

17
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:57,609
Give me your address, ma'am.

18
00:00:57,643 --> 00:00:58,679
[Woman] We're at [beeps].

19
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:01,647
[911 Dispatcher] Okay, ma'am.

20
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:02,855
I need you to stay
on the line with me.

21
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,374
I need you to tell me

22
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:05,789
what's going on.
- You guys, where is Sean?

23
00:01:07,377 --> 00:01:08,482
[Man] I've been looking outside.

24
00:01:09,414 --> 00:01:11,278
I don't know. I don't know.

25
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:12,555
I don't know.

26
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:13,832
[Woman] What do you
mean, you don't know?

27
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,489
[Man] Because we
haven't seen him.

28
00:01:15,523 --> 00:01:17,249
We thought he might
have been outside.

29
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:19,907
I can't see, but-
- There are people outside.

30
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:21,460
[Man] Brett, have
you seen anything?

31
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:22,703
[Brett] No, I haven't.

32
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:25,223
[Man] Well, let's just
get the doors locked.

33
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:26,465
[911 Dispatcher] Ma'am,

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,397
I need you to stay
on the line with me.

35
00:01:27,432 --> 00:01:28,743
Can you tell me what's going on?

36
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:29,572
[Woman] It's okay.

37
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:31,021
I don't know.

38
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:32,230
When I look out the window,
there's just lights.

39
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:33,507
There's lights.

40
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:38,581
[pensive music]

41
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:56,288
It's picturesque,

42
00:01:57,496 --> 00:01:59,809
a cozy farmhouse nestled
in the Golden Plains

43
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:02,915
of America's heartland,
surrounded by rich soil

44
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,849
and the relaxing solitude
of country living.

45
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:08,197
It's the perfect place
to escape your troubles

46
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:09,888
and the trappings
of a busy life.

47
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,339
Perfect.

48
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:14,203
Unless your troubles
can descend on you

49
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:16,481
at any time from any place.

50
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:19,587
[foreboding music]

51
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:24,592
In July of 2013, Sean Miller
disappeared for four days.

52
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:27,630
A four day manhunt ensued
that ended in a phone call

53
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:29,563
from over 100 miles away

54
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:33,774
and a story that would follow
the couple from home to home.

55
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:35,293
Seven years later, the Millers,

56
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:37,087
along with documentary film crew

57
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:40,401
consisting of filmmaker Ash
Hamilton and his wife Chanell

58
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:41,885
and cameraman Brett Pearson

59
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,887
would revisit that
fateful event,

60
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:45,855
culminating in a 911 call

61
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:48,168
that would baffle
anyone who came near it.

62
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:53,138
Hi. It's been a
pleasure to meet you.

63
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,105
Let's just get started
with some basics.

64
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,040
Why don't you give me your
name, your age, occupation.

65
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:00,870
My name is Ash Hamilton.

66
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:05,012
I am 45 years old
and I am a filmmaker.

67
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:06,841
And when I'm not making films,

68
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,912
I also teach film on
the college level,

69
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:10,983
film theory and film production.

70
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:14,539
But I'm probably best known for
my work in the horror genre,

71
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:17,300
serving as a producer on films

72
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:20,027
like "Camp Death III in 2D!".

73
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:21,166
[Announcer] They've
been prescribed

74
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,133
two heaping spoonfuls of death.

75
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,206
"Camp Death III in 2D!"

76
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,831
[Ash] A film based off
of my board game property

77
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:32,384
called "Slice and Dice."

78
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:37,562
[eerie music]

79
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:39,460
I'm gonna slice you to pieces.

80
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,189
[woman grunts]

81
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:49,608
[Ash] And also directing
the award winning short film,

82
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:50,437
"Play With Me."

83
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,063
[Woman] What?
[foreboding music]

84
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:59,515
[man chuckling wickedly]

85
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:07,833
So, tell me how
you became involved

86
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:09,870
in this particular story.

87
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:11,768
How do you know Stacy and Sean?

88
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:13,149
What brought you to this?

89
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:18,396
I had originally heard
about the incident with Sean

90
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:23,124
when it actually
happened in 2013.

91
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,506
I've always been interested
in these subjects,

92
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:29,614
so I was on various different
news sites, different forums,

93
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:33,134
and this was of particular
interest when it came about

94
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:36,241
because I didn't know
how local it was,

95
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,450
but I knew that it was regional.

96
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:41,142
I was pretty sure that it
was in the Illinois area,

97
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:43,938
so I had a little
more interest in it

98
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:46,078
than some of the other stories.

99
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:48,909
And plus, it was, I
mean, in all honesty,

100
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:50,048
it was it was a
little more fantastic

101
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,498
than some of the other stories.

102
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:54,535
This wasn't your typical lights
in the sky kind of thing.

103
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,400
You know, this was an
actual disappearance

104
00:04:57,435 --> 00:04:58,643
and it was something

105
00:04:58,677 --> 00:05:01,508
where they had local law
enforcement involved.

106
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:02,336
It was...

107
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:07,203
I'll reiterate, it was
definitely more fantastic

108
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:08,998
than some of the other
stories at the time

109
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:10,413
that I was taking a look at.

110
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,072
[pensive music]

111
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,945
[Chanell] Okay. So is
this the one you wanted?

112
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:26,395
[Ash] Yes.

113
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:30,260
[Chanell] Okay. Do you
wan't me to get a tripod or...

114
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,332
No, I think we can just
do the hand-held thing.

115
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,851
I mean, this is really
sort of for us anyway,

116
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:36,163
so we don't need to be.

117
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:37,716
- Can I sit down for this?
- Yeah, no.

118
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:39,166
You can go ahead and
sit down. That's fine.

119
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,652
You know, like any good story
that has its own twists,

120
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:44,344
goddammit I'm gonna go
ahead and start that again.

121
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,552
Sorry about that.

122
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:47,450
[beep]

123
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,834
So like any good story,
there are twists and turns.

124
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:53,456
We'll get to that in a minute.

125
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:57,667
Sean Miller incident
happened in 2013.

126
00:05:57,702 --> 00:06:00,187
Sean Miller, who was
a Illinois native,

127
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:03,052
which is sort of why I
was drawn to the story

128
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,606
when it originally
took place in 2013,

129
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:11,025
disappeared for four days,
and when he came back,

130
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,961
there were tall
tales of abduction

131
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,723
from a non-terrestrial
intelligence.

132
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:22,105
He was displaced.

133
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,590
The phone call came.

134
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:26,524
Similar to the Travis
Walton story, miles away.

135
00:06:26,558 --> 00:06:30,631
In this particular instance,
over 100 miles away,

136
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,771
when he finally came back.

137
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:36,534
So there were reports
of phenomena happening

138
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:38,156
previous to this.

139
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,263
So I remember hearing
about it in 2013.

140
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:43,955
We're seeing some
Associated Press articles

141
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:47,234
and it got a hold of it and
ran in a few different places.

142
00:06:47,268 --> 00:06:49,478
And, you know, we thought,

143
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:53,999
man, is there a better
story for a documentary,

144
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:56,036
especially considering
what we're into?

145
00:06:57,693 --> 00:07:02,042
And then we started to try
to make the documentary.

146
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:03,837
And lo and behold,

147
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:10,326
we can't find anything
on the Sean Miller story.

148
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:26,998
[Ash clearing throat]

149
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:32,106
So. It's late.

150
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:34,661
It is, my god!

151
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:41,322
It's 2:56 in the morning
and there's a Reddit thread

152
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,775
that I've been posting
in intermittently

153
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,328
for the last few months.

154
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:52,333
But tonight it was different
because someone DM'd me

155
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:58,098
and they had a screens hot
of one of the articles

156
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:04,449
and this has been
probably the biggest news

157
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,003
on that front in a while.

158
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,489
So I was pretty excited

159
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:15,564
and I'm looking it over
and it looks pretty legit

160
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,705
and not like 5 minutes later

161
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:20,879
I get another DM
from the same guy

162
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:25,815
and he's telling
me that not only

163
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:32,235
does he live like
around the same town

164
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,030
that Sean Miller
currently lives in,

165
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:37,171
like not the residence
from seven years ago

166
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:38,656
or four years ago,

167
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:42,004
but we're talking right now

168
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,974
and he follows all this up

169
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:53,360
with the fact that he says that
he's got his email address.

170
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:10,584
Okay, so it's now
been about a month

171
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:14,692
since I had received
what I was told

172
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:17,487
was Sean Miller's email address.

173
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:21,008
About 8 minutes ago I
receive a notification

174
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:27,774
for a return email from
Sean Miller's email address.

175
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:30,880
Okay.

176
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:35,126
"I hope you don't take
this the wrong way,

177
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,130
but I've been burned on
this before, multiple times,

178
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:40,890
so I'm more than
a little cautious.

179
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,585
We are finally at a point
where we don't get..."

180
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:49,589
I guess it's supposed to say
"we're finally at a point

181
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:54,594
where we don't get a lot
of these emails anymore,

182
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:56,906
and it's taken us
years to get here.

183
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:00,772
Please, you need to
respect our privacy."

184
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,258
Now. Wait.

185
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:06,606
Okay.

186
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,987
"If I give you 5
minutes and I say no.

187
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:10,886
Well, then that's my final no."

188
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,581
So. Yeah, 5 minutes.

189
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:20,343
I'm usually up til midnight.

190
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,002
Holy shit. And there's
actually a phone number here.

191
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:26,591
Here goes.

192
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,456
[expectant music]

193
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:36,739
[phone ringing]

194
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,104
So how are you going to
feel about being away

195
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:58,416
from our home for a week?

196
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:04,353
Well, you know?

197
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:06,873
I'll miss the cats.

198
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:10,704
They won't miss me.

199
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:18,056
And if it were to Disney,

200
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:21,094
that would be super exciting
because it's a vacation.

201
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:23,475
But it's not.

202
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,857
It's to a stranger's house.

203
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:26,686
So.

204
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:30,759
I'm a little bit, little
bit apprehensive, but...

205
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,044
[man laughing]

206
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:46,913
[Ash] I could get a
shoulder under there.

207
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:47,741
That's about it.

208
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:51,296
That's about all I could get.

209
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:53,022
You know I could
probably get under there,

210
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:54,610
but that would not
be that comfortable.

211
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:56,129
I'd probably get a terrible
leg cramp in the hamstring.

212
00:11:56,163 --> 00:11:59,926
I could take a nap, but
I'd wake up with my neck

213
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,928
all screwed up and...

214
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:06,139
[Ash] I am positive that
I could contort myself

215
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:08,175
into position that one testicle

216
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,868
would pop out and
shoot across the room.

217
00:12:10,902 --> 00:12:12,145
Probably.

218
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,629
[Ash] That's what
would happen to me.

219
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:15,044
Just let me know first
and I'll turn on the camera.

220
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:17,115
[Ash] It would be, it would be,

221
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,497
well, it's free special effects,

222
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,637
which I do love free,
as anyone will know.

223
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:24,122
Are you just aiming at me
because you can see my cleavage?

224
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:25,883
[Ash] That's exactly
what I'm doing.

225
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:27,816
Actually.

226
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:33,511
So if you could give
me your full name,

227
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:38,516
your age and what your
affiliation is with the documentary

228
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,519
and the filmmakers behind it.

229
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,762
Okay.

230
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,833
My name is Brett Pearson.

231
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:49,838
I'm 38 years old, and my
association to the filmmakers,

232
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,946
Ash and Chanell are
good friends of mine.

233
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:56,499
I've known 'em for several years

234
00:12:56,534 --> 00:13:00,503
and we've kind of
go back a long way.

235
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:05,474
I've been working
for them on and off,

236
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:10,168
like I said, several years.

237
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:11,307
This is kind of my foundation.

238
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:13,206
This is where I got my feet wet

239
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,382
with doing documentary
type camera work.

240
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:18,314
It's mostly what I do for them,

241
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:20,558
but I've done some mic work,

242
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:24,458
some audio editing, pretty
much whatever I'm asked.

243
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:30,430
So I got called in to do
this documentary to...

244
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:34,917
The Millers.

245
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,438
Things were experienced
at the residence

246
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:41,855
and dropped what I was doing,

247
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,582
which wasn't much of anything
and came to help out.

248
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,347
[Ash] Take a brief tour
here in the Horror Fix offices

249
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:52,832
before we leave.

250
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:57,181
See what our man in the
field, our DP Brett is doing.

251
00:13:58,527 --> 00:13:59,977
Packing shit for the trip.

252
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:04,982
So I got the tripods,
lighting, batteries,

253
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:10,194
extra batteries for when
those don't wanna work.

254
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:12,817
[Ash] You mean, like, every
fucking time? [chuckles]

255
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,922
Tell me about it.

256
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:16,821
Charger for batteries
at the front door.

257
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,443
We can grab that on the way out.

258
00:14:18,478 --> 00:14:19,479
[Ash] Famous last words, man.

259
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:20,376
Yeah, no doubt.

260
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,898
[Ash] What are your
personal thoughts

261
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,900
on the subject matter?

262
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:30,283
Would you consider yourself
a skeptic or a believer?

263
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:31,940
Skeptic, 100%, man,

264
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:34,425
like I got to see
it with my own eyes

265
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:36,185
if I'm gonna believe this.

266
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,637
So, here I come. [chuckles]

267
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,088
All right, get out of here.

268
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:43,848
[Ash] Hey, can I stop
you for just a second?

269
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,711
What?

270
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:50,441
I know I don't pry, and
I'm not trying to pry,

271
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:52,029
but I'm just...

272
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:55,964
You are okay with this, right?

273
00:14:55,998 --> 00:14:59,070
You are fine with
with doing this?

274
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:01,417
Doing this show,
doing documentary?

275
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:02,936
[Ash] Yeah. Yeah.

276
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:04,973
Like, I've done several
of these with you, man.

277
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:07,251
Why would this be any different?

278
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,666
[Ash] Because it is different,

279
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,633
because we know some of the shit

280
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:12,394
that the Millers went through.

281
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,914
And I just want to
know that you're okay

282
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,261
and that you're going
to be okay, because...

283
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:18,676
And because I love you.

284
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,471
I love having you there.

285
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:24,337
But, you know, if you
ever need to sit one out

286
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:26,132
that it's not a big deal, man.

287
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:30,308
Ash. What the fuck
else would I be doing?

288
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:36,797
[Ash] So you're
definitely thinking

289
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:38,661
that we are alone
in the universe.

290
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:43,494
I haven't seen anything
to change my mind.

291
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:47,049
At the end of the night, when
I go to sleep, I'm alone.

292
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:53,159
When we take our last breath,
you're gonna die alone.

293
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:57,335
So unless I was to see
something to change my mind

294
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,889
at this point, no, I don't
believe in any of this.

295
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,693
I prefer to be on the
other end of the camera.

296
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:11,522
Honestly.

297
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:16,354
It's just not really my thing.

298
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:18,943
[Ash] It's okay. I
think we got what we need.

299
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,806
Thanks.

300
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,025
[telephone ringing]

301
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,820
[Ash] And the third
time's the charm.

302
00:16:33,854 --> 00:16:35,270
[Brett] Seriously?

303
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:36,202
[Ash] Like I was telling
you, three in a row.

304
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:37,410
[Brett] Three times a day?

305
00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:39,481
[Ash] Every day,
all from Sean's phone.

306
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:41,034
Seriously, pick it up.

307
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:44,279
No, I'm telling you, pick
it up, it is creepy as hell.

308
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:45,211
Seriously.

309
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:46,143
[Brett] Okay. Okay. Got it.

310
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:48,214
[Ash] Well, do it. Seriously.

311
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:51,217
[Brett] Hello?
[static buzzes]

312
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:52,080
Hello.

313
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:56,187
[static buzzes]

314
00:16:56,222 --> 00:17:00,329
[indistinct whispering]

315
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:02,297
[phone beeps]

316
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:03,850
[Ash] What's wrong?

317
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:05,300
[Brett] I gotta get out
of here for a minute, man.

318
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:06,301
[Ash] Hey, are you okay?

319
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:07,785
- I just need a minute.
- Brett?

320
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,206
[somber music]

321
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:17,174
My name is Chanell Hamilton.

322
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,899
I am 42.

323
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:20,901
I am married to Ash Hamilton

324
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:24,284
and we've been married
for seven years.

325
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,289
And currently my day job is
working for the government.

326
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:35,847
[Brett] And what do
you do with Ash, though,

327
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:37,090
professionally?

328
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:43,579
I do everything he
asks of me, basically.

329
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:47,238
I help set up tripods
and the lighting

330
00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:49,378
and make sure that the
batteries are charged

331
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,553
and make sure we've
got memory cards.

332
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:54,763
[Brett] This is, as you
are, a documentary filmmaker.

333
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:56,385
- Yeah.
- You're part of the crew.

334
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,181
Yeah, definitely a
big part of the crew.

335
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:01,494
He leans on me a
lot for making sure

336
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:04,186
that things are
ready and in order.

337
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:10,296
[car rumbling]

338
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,480
What is your go to,

339
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:30,488
guilty pleasure sad song.

340
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:35,942
The one where-

341
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:37,219
[Chanell] Are we
talking breakup songs

342
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:41,844
or are we talking like
somebody died song or...

343
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:43,018
We can include
breakups in there, sure,

344
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:44,468
we can include breakup songs.

345
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:49,266
So but this is sort of
running the entire scope of,

346
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:52,061
oh my God, I want to die.

347
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,064
This song makes me want to die.

348
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,446
I'm going to listen to
it 10 times on repeat.

349
00:18:58,585 --> 00:18:59,414
How about...

350
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:05,247
R.E.M. "Everybody Hurts".

351
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:08,147
Oh.
[everyone laughs]

352
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:10,356
Breakup song.

353
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,290
[Brett] Oh, you're going
to go for the breakup song?

354
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:15,326
You know, I've had the
most experience, [laughs].

355
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:20,607
Breakup song, there's
this Peter Gabriel song,

356
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:23,127
and I cannot remember
the name of it.

357
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,579
Is it "In your eyes"?
- No.

358
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:27,718
- Or is it "Stay"?
- No.

359
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:28,995
The one he did with Kate Bush.

360
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,892
No.

361
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:31,239
Or is that "Stay"?

362
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:34,173
[Chanell] No, I don't
know. But it's not that.

363
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,244
- "Salisbury Hill"?
- No.

364
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:39,971
I don't think you
know what song it is.

365
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:44,355
I don't remember
the name of the song.

366
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,461
But you know that
it's Peter Gabriel.

367
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:47,289
[Chanell] Yeah.

368
00:19:48,497 --> 00:19:51,811
It's not like a weird
like for some reason,

369
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:53,916
like "Sledgehammer"
was your breakup song?

370
00:20:01,096 --> 00:20:05,065
And what was your initial
opinion of the Millers?

371
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,380
You know, at first they
seemed a little apprehensive.

372
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,452
And somewhat standoffish.

373
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,972
But the the days that
we spent with them,

374
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:19,770
we seemed to grow a
friendship with them.

375
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:24,223
Got to be it.

376
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:26,363
Where are we on the
GPS? Are we close?

377
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:28,192
GPS shows that
this should be it.

378
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,644
So what did he say?

379
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:34,681
Well, he he said a
rickety old picket fence.

380
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:39,686
Which [chuckles] that is a
rickety old picket fence.

381
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:44,864
I mean, it's a great fence,
though, but it's like, man,

382
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:45,830
you can't really
say anything other

383
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:47,246
than a rickety old picket fence.

384
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:51,664
God damn. They are out
in the middle of nowhere.

385
00:20:53,424 --> 00:20:54,218
Jesus.

386
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,603
[Brett] Home sweet home
for the next couple of days.

387
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:03,123
I'm not sure they have
Internet out here, babe.

388
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:06,679
Just being honest with you.

389
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:08,232
I'm not really sure.

390
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,958
I've got like one
and a half bars.

391
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:14,273
[Ash knocking]

392
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:22,729
- Hey.
- Ash?

393
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:24,697
Yes. Hey, you doing?

394
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:25,905
Good seeing you again.

395
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:29,702
Do you mind, just
give her a minute.

396
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:30,668
She's not...

397
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:35,086
super excited that
this happening.

398
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:38,262
So we need to just kind of
let her cool for a second.

399
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,401
Hi.
- Chanell.

400
00:21:39,436 --> 00:21:40,609
Chanell.

401
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:42,370
Yeah, I've heard
about you from Ash.

402
00:21:42,404 --> 00:21:43,578
All good things.

403
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:44,820
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All good things.

404
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:45,683
Brett.

405
00:21:48,168 --> 00:21:50,826
When I first started
talking to Sean,

406
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,140
even though we were hopeful

407
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:56,556
that this whole project
was gonna happen,

408
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:58,834
Sean was extremely reserved.

409
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:03,494
This was a couple that had
not talked to news outlets

410
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:07,533
for the better part of
six years about this.

411
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,203
I'm sorry.

412
00:22:29,244 --> 00:22:33,213
As far I knew everything
was going to be cool.

413
00:22:33,248 --> 00:22:34,698
I feel bad because I
don't want to put you guys

414
00:22:34,732 --> 00:22:38,460
in a position of, not
cool, because, admittedly,

415
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:41,118
that was a little strange.

416
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,396
[Brett] You could cut
tension with a knife.

417
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:46,675
I hope she's going to
be cool because, like.

418
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,643
I already felt
like that tension.

419
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:51,473
Well, it was definitely there.

420
00:22:51,508 --> 00:22:55,443
It was there.

421
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:58,480
What I don't want is for us
to get all the way out here,

422
00:22:58,515 --> 00:23:00,309
and come all the way back,

423
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:03,105
because things weren't
sewn up the way the way

424
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,142
we thought they were gonna be.

425
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,212
But...

426
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:07,765
- I mean, we're here.
- Yeah.

427
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,766
No, you're right.

428
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,009
So let's, for the time being.

429
00:23:11,804 --> 00:23:12,805
You know. All right.

430
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,431
[Interviewer] You've
had some experiences

431
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:21,779
that wouldn't be your
typical shoot, right?

432
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:26,508
And I know this is...

433
00:23:28,337 --> 00:23:31,271
There were incidences,

434
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,416
there were things that happened
on phone calls with Sean,

435
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,421
on Zoom meetings with Sean,
that we could not explain.

436
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:46,873
[Interviewer] So you're
saying that you were starting

437
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:49,117
to experience a co-experience

438
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:51,119
as you were
interacting with Sean?

439
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:57,297
It was, not only very strange,
but it was very unexpected.

440
00:23:57,884 --> 00:23:59,990
[pensive music]

441
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:07,653
Some of the ones that we do,

442
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:10,172
a lot of the the stuff that I do

443
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:13,313
is I try to help organize
the foremen on the job

444
00:24:13,348 --> 00:24:18,353
and try to help
them get stuff done.

445
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:21,252
- Sean, real quick.
- Yeah.

446
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:24,946
Is that what you were
talking about on Zoom

447
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:27,120
as far as the lights?

448
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:29,191
Because I noticed that
that light turned off.

449
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,127
- Yeah.
- There it went again,

450
00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:36,509
but yet we've got the
lights on in the kitchen.

451
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:37,614
Yeah. Yeah.

452
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:41,307
No that's definitely something

453
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:45,173
and I've checked the
wiring in the house

454
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:48,970
and I've had and you
know, at Stacey's,

455
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:53,146
urgency, I've had
other people come in

456
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:55,804
and check it and it's...

457
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:59,290
Everything checked out okay.

458
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,987
[Ash] If you don't
mind me asking.

459
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:08,403
And again, I know that this
is going to seem interruptive

460
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:12,787
because when I think of
questions, I'll ask them.

461
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:15,652
Does that happen so often that
we're going to have problems

462
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:18,309
with our lights, or will
it stay on for a while

463
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:21,071
and then just do
that periodically?

464
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:22,555
I wish I could tell you.

465
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:35,050
[Ash] The incident in 2013

466
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:36,293
and this was
happening in the house

467
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:39,296
previous to the
incident in 2013.

468
00:25:42,713 --> 00:25:44,335
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

469
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,959
[pot clatters]

470
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:48,754
[Ash] Okay.

471
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:54,794
Now, that happened
literally off camera.

472
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:56,313
Yeah.

473
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,970
[Ash] But we're going to
catch the audio on that.

474
00:25:59,454 --> 00:26:03,596
As we were talking about the
phenomena with the lights,

475
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:09,498
Literally one of the
pots from the kitchen

476
00:26:10,983 --> 00:26:15,919
and I'm not exaggerating,
sprang off the wall.

477
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,854
And it did it with such force.

478
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:22,719
Yeah. It busted the
handle, right off.

479
00:26:22,753 --> 00:26:26,377
[Ash] That it actually
busted the handle.

480
00:26:26,412 --> 00:26:29,484
Yeah, 'cause it's only
been used a handful of times.

481
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:30,347
It's fairly new.

482
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:34,454
[Ash] And this is common.

483
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:36,284
This is another common thing.

484
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:37,906
It's something. Yeah.

485
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:42,462
I don't want to say it's normal.

486
00:26:42,497 --> 00:26:45,776
'Cause I mean, this
isn't normal, right?

487
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:48,399
It is for me.

488
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:55,027
[Interviewer]
We've heard reports

489
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:56,545
of cryptids and
poltergeist activity

490
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,031
associated with the
Sean Miller case.

491
00:26:59,065 --> 00:27:03,207
Is this atypical of UFO
abduction encounters?

492
00:27:03,242 --> 00:27:04,726
Yes.

493
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:08,627
Many people don't realize when
there are cases of anything

494
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:11,422
that can be labeled
paranormal or supernatural.

495
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:13,390
There are areas where there are

496
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:16,324
a lot of different
things going on.

497
00:27:16,358 --> 00:27:18,188
And what I mean by that is

498
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:22,123
you'll find even geographical
areas of the world

499
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:25,644
where you will have
reports of UFO sightings,

500
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:28,716
of Bigfoot sightings,
of ghost encounters

501
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,200
all in the same place.

502
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,961
You know, we in the field
are still investigating that.

503
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:34,583
We keep our mind open.

504
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:36,655
We're looking to see if
there's a relationship

505
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:37,863
and all of that that happens.

506
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:41,729
But it is not out of
the realm of possibility

507
00:27:41,763 --> 00:27:44,939
that there are different
paranormal occurrences

508
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:47,527
happening in one
particular incident.

509
00:27:47,562 --> 00:27:50,496
[foreboding music]

510
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:12,483
[Ash] Okay. So we are
going to try this again.

511
00:28:12,518 --> 00:28:15,590
We keep having battery
issues with the audio unit

512
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:20,250
batteries draining as
well as the camera itself.

513
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:23,425
New batteries of both units
that we have had to replace

514
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,876
within about three
minutes of shooting.

515
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:28,879
So we're going to try
to do it this time

516
00:28:28,914 --> 00:28:30,985
and see what happens.

517
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:32,434
Luckily, we got
plenty of batteries,

518
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:35,403
so I think we can keep
switching out if we need to.

519
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,993
So I know that this was
part of the test footage

520
00:28:39,027 --> 00:28:40,546
we ran through earlier,

521
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,755
I know that we had
some lighting issues.

522
00:28:43,963 --> 00:28:45,758
This is all stuff that
we talked about on Zoom

523
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:47,139
that we were prepared for.

524
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:49,348
It is just happening
a little more rapidly

525
00:28:49,382 --> 00:28:50,867
than we had expected.

526
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:53,076
So we should still
be good, though.

527
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:58,081
So if you could please give
me your name, your age.

528
00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:07,366
Just give us your name, your
age, and your occupation.

529
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:12,371
Sean Miller.

530
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:14,822
I'm 43 years old.

531
00:29:14,856 --> 00:29:19,792
I am a Project Inspector for
a local construction company.

532
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:27,282
[pensive music]

533
00:29:27,317 --> 00:29:28,594
[Ash] If you could Sean,

534
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:31,942
Could you tell us how long
you've lived in the Midwest,

535
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:33,323
have you always
lived in the Midwest?

536
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:39,916
Yeah. Since I was little.

537
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:42,815
Probably about eight or nine.

538
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:46,612
For the most part, I
lived in the Midwest area.

539
00:29:49,235 --> 00:29:54,102
When I was young, my
dad did a lot of...

540
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:02,076
traveling with his company

541
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:06,701
and before he left

542
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:16,055
we settled here with
my mom, myself and him.

543
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:21,060
And then we pretty much
stayed, my mom and I.

544
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:25,582
[Ash] Apologies,
but are your parents

545
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:26,997
currently alive or deceased?

546
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:30,380
My mother's alive.

547
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,209
My father...

548
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:34,867
[static buzzes]

549
00:30:38,664 --> 00:30:39,492
Sorry.

550
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:45,084
We talked about this happening.

551
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:54,438
[Interviewer] So we've
seen moments that looks like

552
00:30:54,473 --> 00:30:58,684
it has affected every single
aspect off Sean's life.

553
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:03,654
There were moments where,
now mind you we went into this

554
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:06,726
with the idea of
entertainment value,

555
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:09,764
and that was what we were trying

556
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:11,421
to sort of capture
from the start.

557
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:17,530
However, I think when you
do see just how affected

558
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:21,396
someone is, it does
sort of center things

559
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:23,226
and ground it a little bit.

560
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,231
And I think you can tell,
especially some points

561
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:32,821
where he's trying so
hard to be normal,

562
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:36,135
and I guess he's trying so
hard to just live his life

563
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:39,932
and it's almost like
he almost gets there.

564
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,590
And then there's
just so much baggage

565
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:44,764
that it just draws him back.

566
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,250
And I think we saw that a
lot while we were there.

567
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:54,913
I think the biggest
thing is that I just,

568
00:31:56,121 --> 00:32:00,090
I like how neatly
they wrap up a mystery

569
00:32:01,574 --> 00:32:04,819
in that 20, 15 to 20 minutes.

570
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:07,926
You know, it was kind of
like put a neat bow on it.

571
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,411
But as a kid, you just,

572
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:12,240
you almost kind of
knew it was coming.

573
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:14,346
Like he knew exactly
who the bad guy was.

574
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,796
But you still, there's
a little part of you

575
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:18,660
that thought they might
throw a curve ball.

576
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:20,421
It was whoever
owned property, right?

577
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:21,698
Yeah.

578
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,045
It was like, just look
at the property owner

579
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,253
in "Scooby Doo".

580
00:32:25,288 --> 00:32:28,256
If you're a property
owner, you're a villain.

581
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,809
That's all there is to it.

582
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:33,399
I think this was one of the
first full frontal assaults

583
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:36,092
on out of control capitalism
in American cartoons.

584
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,715
[Chanell] Big fan of the Snorks.

585
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:41,373
You mean underwater Smurfs?

586
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:42,650
Fuck, yeah.

587
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:46,171
Second, but equal to
the Snorks is Smurfs.

588
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:47,689
Obviously.

589
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:53,523
But, you know, when I
was probably somewhere

590
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,490
second, third, fourth grade,

591
00:32:57,285 --> 00:32:59,805
when I would get
home from school,

592
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,531
the exact time I got
home from school,

593
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:04,879
I could not get off the bus
fast enough and get inside.

594
00:33:04,913 --> 00:33:07,813
Oddly, it was the animated
"Dennis the Menace".

595
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,851
It was weird, that
I had to watch

596
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:14,854
those 25 minutes of
"Dennis the Menace".

597
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:18,306
Running from the bus
missed the first 5 minutes,

598
00:33:18,341 --> 00:33:21,309
but still, had to be there.

599
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:23,518
So, you were always running
low 5 minutes of Menace.

600
00:33:23,553 --> 00:33:25,003
There was an episode.

601
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:31,354
I love old school "Star Wars"
and droids was, like it.

602
00:33:33,356 --> 00:33:35,565
Was was it Ewoks and Droids?

603
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,739
- Ewoks and Droids.
- Yes.

604
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:39,914
And there is this episode

605
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:45,954
and it was I want to say,
it's one of the ones that was

606
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:48,405
I mean, a lot of them did
crossovers with End or,

607
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,889
it was one of the
ones where I think

608
00:33:49,924 --> 00:33:51,684
they they all went to End or.

609
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:54,998
And I never got to see it again.

610
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:55,964
It only aired.

611
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:56,896
I missed that episode.

612
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:58,174
You talk about missing episodes.

613
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,692
I missed that episode.

614
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:01,108
And it was, I happened to
miss it because that week...

615
00:34:06,768 --> 00:34:11,635
that week and that weekend, I
was out camping with family.

616
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:14,638
We were out at a lake
and a cabin we had

617
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:16,088
and we were out there camping.

618
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:18,711
It was a great week,
it was a lot of fun.

619
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:22,612
But the reason that I
remember that is because

620
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,821
not only did I miss that
episode that never aired again,

621
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,340
that was super pissed,
because I didn't get to see it

622
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:30,447
until recently when you can
find everything on the internet.

623
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:34,175
But one of my friends I
got back told me that,

624
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,631
my friend Shane, he told me
that all the kids on the block,

625
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:45,945
were sitting there
in front of my house

626
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,328
watching these lights go by.

627
00:34:49,363 --> 00:34:51,330
And I was like, "What are
you talking about lights?"

628
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:54,713
Like, Are you talking about,
like, you know, people

629
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:57,440
running around with
flashlights playing night tag?

630
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,307
Like we used to sit around,
like, you know, give-

631
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:03,446
- Flashlight tag.
- Yeah, flashlight tag.

632
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,551
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

633
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:06,828
But he's like, "No,
no", he's like,

634
00:35:06,863 --> 00:35:11,212
"We were all camped out
kind of on the street."

635
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:13,145
We lived a little outside
of town, but not too far,

636
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,355
kind of in a little
kind of rural suburb.

637
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:20,325
And on my street, all
the kids are gathered,

638
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:24,260
I guess there's these
like spheres of light

639
00:35:24,294 --> 00:35:27,297
that just kind of went
up and down the street

640
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:29,886
and they thought, at first,

641
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,887
"Are you talking about
firefly's or something?"

642
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,510
"No, no, like actual balls,

643
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:36,237
like about the size, some of
them the size of a golf ball,

644
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:38,688
something a little
bigger, like a softball."

645
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:43,693
And they were they were
looking for me, he said.

646
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,629
But I don't know.

647
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:50,976
I don't know.

648
00:35:52,978 --> 00:35:54,773
But they stopped
when I got back.

649
00:35:57,569 --> 00:35:58,846
They stopped.

650
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,814
[foreboding music]

651
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:05,301
[Interviewer] I know
that you've all had

652
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:07,199
some lighthearted moments.

653
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:09,857
Did you ever think that you
could turn your cameras off?

654
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:12,618
It was like it was a
struggle to put the camera down

655
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:14,896
because I think each
of us felt the moment

656
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:16,450
we were going to put one
of those cameras down,

657
00:36:16,484 --> 00:36:17,968
something was going to happen

658
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:19,694
that could not be duplicated.

659
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:23,284
Something new, something
even more intense.

660
00:36:25,907 --> 00:36:30,049
Literally like 65
floors up, 65 floors up.

661
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:31,327
So this guy is hanging
over the railing.

662
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:32,673
This is wrought iron.

663
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:35,123
There's absolutely
nothing keeping him

664
00:36:35,158 --> 00:36:37,298
from literally
falling off the...

665
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,990
[knock on door]

666
00:36:42,338 --> 00:36:44,063
Yeah. Lemme go check.

667
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:45,582
Sorry, guys. Hold on a second.

668
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:52,244
[Chanell] Girl scouts.
Want some cookies?

669
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:54,108
[knocking on back door]

670
00:36:54,142 --> 00:36:56,593
Babe, babe I think.

671
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:57,836
I think they're around back.

672
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,769
Okay. Yeah, they
might go around.

673
00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:05,326
[knock on front door]

674
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:07,811
But probably some fucking kids.

675
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:08,847
Oh, fuck in with us.

676
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:10,331
Okay, you know what?

677
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:13,645
You guys go that way, and
we're gonna go around this way,

678
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,371
and we'll try to see
if we can cut 'em off

679
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:16,337
around the corner, okay?
- Okay.

680
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:17,752
- All right.
- Come on.

681
00:37:18,891 --> 00:37:20,238
Assholes.

682
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:24,725
- Do you have a flashlight?
- Yeah, I got one.

683
00:37:27,866 --> 00:37:28,936
Hey, who's out there?

684
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:46,643
[knocking on door]

685
00:37:46,678 --> 00:37:47,886
[Ash] You guys
seriously just knock?

686
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,922
- No, No.
- No we didn't.

687
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:55,963
I saw the fucking door.

688
00:37:55,997 --> 00:37:57,689
Something was
knocking on the door.

689
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:00,830
You just walked up, and
the door was almost.

690
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,832
[Ash] From the outside?

691
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:04,834
Something was there, knocking.

692
00:38:06,214 --> 00:38:08,596
[Brett] 100% Ash.
Totally seen that.

693
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:11,461
It's on camera.

694
00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:42,941
[Chanell] Hey.

695
00:38:42,975 --> 00:38:44,563
Hey, baby. Ash!

696
00:38:44,598 --> 00:38:46,634
Babe! You got to get up.

697
00:38:46,669 --> 00:38:47,808
You got to.

698
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:49,016
You got to see
what Brett's doing.

699
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:49,913
You got to see what
you he's doing.

700
00:38:49,948 --> 00:38:52,260
He's out here. He's out here.

701
00:38:52,295 --> 00:38:53,331
Okay.

702
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,262
Should I grab my phone?

703
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:55,919
[Chanell] God Yes. Yes.

704
00:38:55,954 --> 00:38:56,989
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

705
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,956
C'mon hurry up.

706
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,958
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

707
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:01,753
[Ash] Goddammit, I gotta find.

708
00:39:01,787 --> 00:39:03,686
I gotta turn the
fucking light on.

709
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,826
[Chanell] You know
how to use this thing?

710
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:17,424
He's not there.

711
00:39:19,184 --> 00:39:20,565
He's on the stairs.

712
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,670
- He's on the fucking stairs?
- He's on the stairs.

713
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:24,914
He's on the stairs.

714
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:27,192
So, I don't know.

715
00:39:27,226 --> 00:39:28,780
[Ash] What the fuck is
he doing on the stairs?

716
00:39:28,814 --> 00:39:32,059
I have no clue.
He's freaking me out.

717
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:34,475
Look at this!

718
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,615
[Ash] He's right over here.

719
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,583
[Chanell] We can't see him,

720
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:41,482
at least let me
get the flashlight.

721
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:51,527
[Ash] What in the fucking world?

722
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:01,399
What the fuck is going on?
- What is he doing?

723
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,265
Is he fucking talking?

724
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,958
[Chanell] Yeah. Looks like it.

725
00:40:11,754 --> 00:40:13,341
[Ash] I gotta
fucking wake him up.

726
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:14,688
[Chanell] I don't
think that's a good idea.

727
00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:16,068
[Ash] I gotta
fucking wake him up.

728
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:17,829
You know what's
gonna fuckin' happen?

729
00:40:17,863 --> 00:40:18,864
He's gonna wake Sean and Stacey,

730
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:21,073
which we can't fucking have.

731
00:40:21,108 --> 00:40:25,284
And second of all, he's half
fucking asleep on the stairs.

732
00:40:27,735 --> 00:40:30,358
[Chanell] Don't make
him fall down the stairs.

733
00:40:30,393 --> 00:40:34,190
[Ash] He's not gonna
fucking fall down the stairs.

734
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:37,262
[Ash] I don't
think is a good idea.

735
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,060
Brett.

736
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:48,825
[Brett mumbling incoherently]
Brett.

737
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:51,656
Brett.

738
00:40:59,629 --> 00:41:02,183
[eerie music]

739
00:41:02,218 --> 00:41:03,012
Dude.

740
00:41:05,117 --> 00:41:06,809
Whoa, whoa. Fuck.

741
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,367
[Interviewer] We
know that Brett,

742
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:16,853
who just went through a divorce,
recently lost their son.

743
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:18,510
Was this the best place for him?

744
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:22,859
I didn't think that this
was the best one for him

745
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:24,378
in the beginning.

746
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:28,106
And we talked about it.

747
00:41:29,314 --> 00:41:33,905
And then by the time
we were as thick

748
00:41:33,939 --> 00:41:35,596
in the situation as we were,

749
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:37,909
he definitely shouldn't
have been there.

750
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,885
Stacy, it's really
nice to meet you today.

751
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,578
Can you tell me, though,
your name and your occupation

752
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:54,408
and how did you know Sean?

753
00:41:54,442 --> 00:41:56,168
I'm Stacey Miller.

754
00:41:56,203 --> 00:41:58,619
I am the wife of Sean Miller.

755
00:41:58,654 --> 00:42:03,590
I'm 36 years old and I'm a
bank teller at a local bank.

756
00:42:04,763 --> 00:42:05,833
I see.

757
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:07,559
Have you talked about this

758
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:09,941
with many of your
neighbors or friends,

759
00:42:09,975 --> 00:42:13,461
or how widely known
is this situation?

760
00:42:13,496 --> 00:42:16,844
No, I don't talk to much people.

761
00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:18,294
I mean, I have my sister.

762
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,365
She's my backbone.

763
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:22,609
Other than that,
I keep to myself.

764
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:24,196
It's just gotten to that point.

765
00:42:26,716 --> 00:42:30,064
[Ash] You'll have to forgive
me here, but I'm still unsure

766
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:32,964
as to why you decided
to stay in the house

767
00:42:32,998 --> 00:42:33,999
that you're in now

768
00:42:35,207 --> 00:42:39,280
when you've left some of
the others so quickly.

769
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:42,318
Well.

770
00:42:45,493 --> 00:42:47,737
[Stacey] Tell them
why you made us stay.

771
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:55,987
Maybe. Why don't we?

772
00:42:56,021 --> 00:42:58,714
Can we circle back
to that one can we,

773
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:00,681
we will circle back.

774
00:43:00,716 --> 00:43:01,579
Yeah.

775
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:02,649
We will circle back.

776
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:09,621
[foreboding music]

777
00:43:14,453 --> 00:43:15,834
[Sean] I gotta be quick

778
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:17,560
because I got the
interview today later on.

779
00:43:18,872 --> 00:43:20,390
Cross your fingers
it all works out.

780
00:43:20,425 --> 00:43:21,737
[Stacey] Okay.

781
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:24,084
Oh hey.

782
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:26,155
Since I know you don't
have a lot of time.

783
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:27,432
I know we had talked about,

784
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:29,020
we needed to get
the video footage

785
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:33,265
that you have on your
phone onto our SDS

786
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,578
so that we can take them back.

787
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,961
So if you could, just
give us your pass code

788
00:43:38,995 --> 00:43:40,376
and we'll go ahead
and do it all.

789
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,584
You don't have to
worry about it.

790
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,792
If you're gonna
be getting ready,

791
00:43:42,827 --> 00:43:43,690
we can do it while
you're getting ready.

792
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:45,864
I looked over it man

793
00:43:45,899 --> 00:43:47,659
and there isn't a whole
lot on there, dude.

794
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:51,387
I don't know if I just didn't
do it right or whatever.

795
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,216
But there's just, I guess I
must not have pressed a button

796
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:55,184
or something or other
just didn't seem like it

797
00:43:55,218 --> 00:43:56,875
turned out okay.

798
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,050
Honestly, we can use
anything for b-roll.

799
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:00,568
So even if it's stuff
just around the house.

800
00:44:00,603 --> 00:44:03,813
I mean, even if it's stuff
that you think is not good.

801
00:44:03,848 --> 00:44:07,541
I don't think really
it picked up anything.

802
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:10,026
I don't think there's
anything on there

803
00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:11,165
that'll work for you.

804
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,652
So listen, babe.

805
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:15,480
This is all great.

806
00:44:15,514 --> 00:44:16,412
Thank you so much.

807
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,069
But I've got to get ready,

808
00:44:18,103 --> 00:44:20,623
so I'm gonna go change
real quick, okay?

809
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,486
Okay.

810
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:28,631
[door squeaking]

811
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,820
Here. One nine, seven, eight.

812
00:44:44,854 --> 00:44:46,166
You can get into it.

813
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:04,563
It's Sean.

814
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:05,841
It's a little after two.

815
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:11,156
I've been hearing this
noise nonstop all night.

816
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:14,332
[unintelligible noise]

817
00:45:14,366 --> 00:45:15,816
Think there's something
outside the window?

818
00:45:15,851 --> 00:45:18,198
It sounds like something's
trying to get my attention.

819
00:45:20,062 --> 00:45:21,649
So I'm gonna, I'm going
to go check it out

820
00:45:21,684 --> 00:45:23,168
and see what it is.

821
00:45:23,203 --> 00:45:27,586
I can hear it our there now,
hopefully I can catch it.

822
00:45:30,003 --> 00:45:33,247
[unintelligible noise]

823
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:37,286
[deep breathing]

824
00:45:38,183 --> 00:45:40,945
[static buzzing]

825
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:43,844
That's imposssible.

826
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,676
It's really him.

827
00:45:49,608 --> 00:45:50,437
God.

828
00:45:53,198 --> 00:45:54,027
He's here.

829
00:45:56,374 --> 00:45:59,101
[deep breathing]

830
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:03,036
[door creaking]

831
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,106
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

832
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:07,005
Excuse me.

833
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,403
We did not take your
phone, by the way.

834
00:46:25,437 --> 00:46:26,645
I want you to know that.

835
00:46:27,715 --> 00:46:32,720
But, we do need to make sure

836
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:36,932
that everything that
you have, we also have.

837
00:46:38,243 --> 00:46:39,555
It's very important.

838
00:46:40,728 --> 00:46:44,111
It is the reason why
we are, let's face it,

839
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:45,768
we're paying for
the documentary.

840
00:46:50,393 --> 00:46:53,224
Well, [clears throat] all right.

841
00:46:53,258 --> 00:46:54,363
I understand.

842
00:46:57,021 --> 00:46:59,126
I don't mean to keep
anything from you.

843
00:47:00,714 --> 00:47:03,372
So I think that there's something
that you guys should see.

844
00:47:05,753 --> 00:47:06,720
I'll be right back.

845
00:47:12,277 --> 00:47:14,555
What do you think he has?

846
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:17,420
Did he tell you about anything?

847
00:47:17,455 --> 00:47:20,078
[Brett] That was super awkward.

848
00:47:20,113 --> 00:47:22,632
This is the stuff that we need.

849
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:24,427
We've got to have it.

850
00:47:35,611 --> 00:47:37,613
This is my me and my dad.

851
00:47:38,545 --> 00:47:39,649
I was eight years old.

852
00:47:40,996 --> 00:47:44,240
It was our last trip.

853
00:47:44,275 --> 00:47:45,966
And the last time
I really saw him.

854
00:47:53,008 --> 00:47:54,664
The other night.

855
00:47:54,699 --> 00:47:55,665
This is...

856
00:47:57,529 --> 00:47:58,876
I took a picture of this.

857
00:48:00,118 --> 00:48:01,671
And you can see if you look,

858
00:48:01,706 --> 00:48:05,192
you can see that's
the same shirt.

859
00:48:06,193 --> 00:48:07,574
You can see that pattern.

860
00:48:09,576 --> 00:48:10,439
Right there.

861
00:48:11,612 --> 00:48:12,890
I don't know if I can
really see anything.

862
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:14,236
Sean, I'm sorry.
- Look.

863
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,202
Look on this.

864
00:48:15,237 --> 00:48:17,032
I mean, I'm not lying.

865
00:48:19,068 --> 00:48:21,174
Look, I mean, it's right there.

866
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:22,416
That's the same.

867
00:48:23,521 --> 00:48:25,316
I mean, maybe
Chanell, can you see?

868
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,732
I mean, right there.
Do you see it?

869
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:31,046
I see something. I just don't.

870
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,015
He's been. It's him.

871
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:42,367
After we found that footage

872
00:48:42,402 --> 00:48:46,095
and after we sort of
confronted him about it,

873
00:48:47,994 --> 00:48:52,377
he was, hellbent

874
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:55,242
to try to persuade us
that that was his father

875
00:48:55,277 --> 00:48:57,141
in those photos.

876
00:48:58,659 --> 00:48:59,937
It was something.

877
00:49:01,248 --> 00:49:03,871
But again, that was the
nature of being there.

878
00:49:03,906 --> 00:49:06,564
You got certain stuff that
was just unbelievable.

879
00:49:06,598 --> 00:49:08,704
You couldn't believe you got it.

880
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:11,086
And then you were
two layers removed

881
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,709
because, and we discussed this,

882
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:17,126
the DSLRs wouldn't work all
of a sudden, hand held devices,

883
00:49:17,161 --> 00:49:18,645
phones wouldn't work
all of a sudden,

884
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:20,750
and then you're forced
to take Polaroids.

885
00:49:20,785 --> 00:49:23,236
And, you know, that's
the nature of the beast

886
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:24,513
when it comes to
stuff like that.

887
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:29,000
It's technology that
it's very difficult

888
00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:31,623
to use as far as proof.

889
00:49:33,591 --> 00:49:34,419
He believed it.

890
00:50:53,464 --> 00:50:56,536
You know, in looking
at the Sean Miller case,

891
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,815
we have to be very, very careful
when we check the evidence.

892
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:02,714
We are in a day and age
where it's very easy

893
00:51:02,749 --> 00:51:05,269
to manipulate your evidence.

894
00:51:05,303 --> 00:51:09,066
So analyzing becomes
very important.

895
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:15,244
[Interviewer] This has
happened more than once,

896
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:16,763
not once, but twice,

897
00:51:16,797 --> 00:51:19,766
Sean, withholding footage
from you and now Brett,

898
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,457
he's withholding
footage from you.

899
00:51:24,702 --> 00:51:29,534
I think after we saw the footage

900
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:31,605
that Sean had withheld from us.

901
00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:39,475
I think Brett's perspective
on why we were there

902
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:45,171
and why he was there,
changed greatly.

903
00:51:45,205 --> 00:51:47,863
[pensive music]

904
00:52:12,957 --> 00:52:16,202
[Brett] [exhaling]
It's 2:32 a.m.

905
00:52:18,756 --> 00:52:21,931
I just fucking got woke
up by this loud ass sound

906
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:24,796
coming outside.

907
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:27,178
I don't know what
it is. It's bizarre.

908
00:52:28,697 --> 00:52:31,907
But it just keeps getting
fuckin' louder and louder.

909
00:52:33,736 --> 00:52:36,601
And I've been up for
about five minutes.

910
00:52:36,636 --> 00:52:38,396
Everyone's asleep in the house.

911
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:41,330
[strange sound]

912
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:42,159
Holy shit.

913
00:52:44,575 --> 00:52:45,645
That's the sound
I'm talking about.

914
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:47,060
You fucking hear that?

915
00:52:48,889 --> 00:52:50,926
[strange sound]

916
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,859
What the fuck was that?

917
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,554
I got up, I grabbed my phone

918
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:00,591
because I don't want
to miss any footage.

919
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:03,318
I'm going to try to get
a peek out the window

920
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:06,804
and see if I can figure out
what is making this sound.

921
00:53:14,605 --> 00:53:18,091
[Brett breathing heavily]

922
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:22,095
Oh, fuck.

923
00:53:24,062 --> 00:53:28,998
Dude, there's someone outside,
just fucking standing there.

924
00:53:34,487 --> 00:53:37,731
I don't want to fucking
be here right now.

925
00:53:37,766 --> 00:53:39,216
There should be no one here.

926
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,460
What the fuck is going on?

927
00:53:43,565 --> 00:53:46,395
[strange sound]
Holy shit!

928
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:49,329
[thudding on roof]

929
00:53:52,401 --> 00:53:55,404
Someone just fucking
came running at the door

930
00:53:55,439 --> 00:53:57,303
and fucking jumped on the roof.

931
00:53:59,857 --> 00:54:01,341
And it fuckin' looked like me.

932
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:05,587
What the fuck is
going on right now?

933
00:54:08,072 --> 00:54:08,866
Holy shit.

934
00:54:13,008 --> 00:54:15,838
My name is James Chandler,
and I'm 54 years old

935
00:54:15,873 --> 00:54:18,151
and I'm an audio
visual specialist.

936
00:54:18,185 --> 00:54:19,842
I've been hired to
look into things

937
00:54:19,877 --> 00:54:21,223
where video has been edited

938
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:24,675
or to see if someone
has faked something.

939
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:28,886
I was not expecting what I saw.

940
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,028
I don't think if it was faked
that my emotional response,

941
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:35,202
I mean, I've seen
a lot of video.

942
00:54:35,237 --> 00:54:37,895
I've seen really
horrible things on video.

943
00:54:37,929 --> 00:54:42,900
That is something that just
got a hold of something in me,

944
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:46,697
and I can't explain it.

945
00:54:46,731 --> 00:54:49,631
[foreboding music]

946
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,369
[Ash] Thank you.
I appreciate it.

947
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:04,646
[Stacey chuckling]

948
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,061
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

949
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:09,098
Hey, you. What
do you have on you?

950
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:10,237
What is this?

951
00:55:12,826 --> 00:55:14,345
Oh, no.

952
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,174
- Sean.
- What? It's nothing.

953
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:17,762
What do you mean?

954
00:55:19,385 --> 00:55:21,939
[static buzzes]

955
00:55:21,973 --> 00:55:24,044
[Chanell] What
did he have on him?

956
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,632
[Stacey] Something black.

957
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:28,048
Something really
dark out of his ear.

958
00:55:31,707 --> 00:55:33,640
As I'm driving, I've
got the window down.

959
00:55:33,675 --> 00:55:34,883
Like I said, it was extreme.

960
00:55:34,917 --> 00:55:36,160
Like I told you before,

961
00:55:36,194 --> 00:55:39,197
it was extremely hot
that summer, you know.

962
00:55:39,232 --> 00:55:41,683
But instead of kicking the
AC on, I felt like maybe

963
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:46,688
just getting that nice like
wind, the smell of the grass,

964
00:55:47,689 --> 00:55:50,554
the smell of the farm soil.

965
00:55:50,588 --> 00:55:53,660
I thought that might help
kind of clear my head.

966
00:55:53,695 --> 00:55:57,319
And so, you know, I'm driving
down the country roads.

967
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,803
I feel like I'm
on the right way.

968
00:55:58,838 --> 00:56:01,392
I've got my hand on
the steering wheel

969
00:56:01,427 --> 00:56:03,670
and I'm just kind
of get my head out

970
00:56:03,705 --> 00:56:08,468
and I'm just feeling it
blow and I'm looking out

971
00:56:08,503 --> 00:56:12,472
and I see, you know, on the
field I could see fireflies,

972
00:56:12,507 --> 00:56:14,716
you know, which is common
at that time of year.

973
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,269
You could see them move around.

974
00:56:19,514 --> 00:56:20,998
And then I realized
that they're not,

975
00:56:21,032 --> 00:56:24,829
like I realize that some of
these are pacing the car.

976
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:30,594
And at first I'm like,
oh drunk brain, you know,

977
00:56:30,628 --> 00:56:32,837
just perception being off.

978
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:35,012
It's dark. I'm tired.

979
00:56:35,046 --> 00:56:36,185
I'm upset.

980
00:56:39,085 --> 00:56:42,226
There was less lights at first.

981
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,504
Just certain ones chasing me.

982
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:49,267
And then I felt
like I wasn't alone.

983
00:56:49,302 --> 00:56:51,615
It felt like
something was almost

984
00:56:51,649 --> 00:56:52,650
whispering to me like that.

985
00:56:52,685 --> 00:56:54,203
So the pressure that, like.

986
00:56:54,238 --> 00:56:57,862
Like that sound was,
like, pulling me...

987
00:56:57,897 --> 00:56:59,174
Like somebody was
controlling my body

988
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:00,347
to pull me in a
different direction.

989
00:57:00,382 --> 00:57:02,280
I realized very
quickly that every time

990
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:05,076
I wanted to go back home,
to go back to my wife,

991
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:07,734
to go back to bed and
wake up the next morning

992
00:57:07,769 --> 00:57:11,566
and just hope this day goes
away and I can start over fresh.

993
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,706
The more I kept being
pulled somewhere else,

994
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,329
and the more I
fought against it,

995
00:57:16,363 --> 00:57:19,470
the stronger like the
brighter the lights

996
00:57:19,505 --> 00:57:20,851
or the brighter
the fireflies were.

997
00:57:20,885 --> 00:57:22,266
And I realized they
weren't fireflies,

998
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,511
they were these motes,
these lights everywhere.

999
00:57:25,545 --> 00:57:29,515
And it was almost like, you
know, I had the car radio

1000
00:57:29,549 --> 00:57:31,206
started getting loud
almost to the point

1001
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,588
where it's like high
pitched and I shut it off.

1002
00:57:33,622 --> 00:57:36,245
I couldn't deal with,
it was sensory overload.

1003
00:57:37,419 --> 00:57:38,696
And I'm just driving
through the dark,

1004
00:57:38,731 --> 00:57:39,732
but it's not dark anymore.

1005
00:57:39,766 --> 00:57:40,974
It's so bright.

1006
00:57:41,009 --> 00:57:42,424
It's brighter than any
daylight I've ever seen.

1007
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,151
And I feel like as I'm
zipping down these roads,

1008
00:57:45,185 --> 00:57:46,670
I'm going so fast,

1009
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:48,326
I don't even know if I'm
even on the road anymore.

1010
00:57:48,361 --> 00:57:51,019
I can't tell what's
up or down anymore.

1011
00:57:51,053 --> 00:57:52,227
I'm just going.

1012
00:58:02,996 --> 00:58:05,171
Were you ever afraid for
your own personal safety.

1013
00:58:05,205 --> 00:58:07,829
Yes. Yes.

1014
00:58:07,863 --> 00:58:10,383
- Yours and the crew?
- Everyone's.

1015
00:58:10,417 --> 00:58:13,006
Everyone's. We were
afraid for my safety.

1016
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:15,043
Especially Ash's safety.

1017
00:58:16,769 --> 00:58:20,393
Sean, Stacey, Brett. Everyone.

1018
00:58:36,616 --> 00:58:37,824
[Woman] I can go talk
to her if you want.

1019
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:39,757
[Sean] You like the burger, man?

1020
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:42,242
Well, I will say, you
made sure it was dead.

1021
00:58:42,277 --> 00:58:43,589
Drew, could you stop?

1022
00:58:43,623 --> 00:58:46,281
- Well, I mean-
- Everything's fine.

1023
00:58:47,593 --> 00:58:50,112
I mean, did you at
least call Dave today?

1024
00:58:50,147 --> 00:58:52,183
- No.
- Here we go.

1025
00:58:52,218 --> 00:58:53,460
I didn't call Dave.

1026
00:58:53,495 --> 00:58:55,221
How many of these
do I have to set up?

1027
00:58:55,255 --> 00:58:58,017
I'm trying real fucking hard

1028
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:00,122
to get you going to set you up.

1029
00:59:00,157 --> 00:59:01,089
No, man, really.

1030
00:59:02,642 --> 00:59:04,886
I want to be able to
just have you guys over

1031
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,163
and have a good time.

1032
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:09,580
Yeah. I can't fucking
do this anymore.

1033
00:59:09,615 --> 00:59:10,650
Drew sit down!

1034
00:59:10,685 --> 00:59:12,859
- No.
- Come on.

1035
00:59:12,894 --> 00:59:14,136
Nice.

1036
00:59:14,171 --> 00:59:16,000
Can't I even go to the bathroom?

1037
00:59:16,035 --> 00:59:17,312
My God.

1038
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:18,382
We have a bathroom
right in there, man.

1039
00:59:18,416 --> 00:59:20,833
Oh, my God. 10 feet away.

1040
00:59:20,867 --> 00:59:22,213
Just stop.

1041
00:59:22,248 --> 00:59:23,732
[Chanell] Should I
turn the camera away

1042
00:59:23,767 --> 00:59:24,837
from the peeing guy?

1043
00:59:27,978 --> 00:59:29,462
He's been a mess for a week now.

1044
00:59:29,496 --> 00:59:31,878
I don't know what's wrong

1045
00:59:31,913 --> 00:59:33,915
I'm sorry. I did
try calling him.

1046
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:35,399
It just didn't work out.

1047
00:59:35,433 --> 00:59:37,504
We just need to
change the subject.

1048
00:59:37,539 --> 00:59:39,783
No more talk about it.

1049
00:59:39,817 --> 00:59:41,647
Drew, what are you doing?

1050
00:59:41,681 --> 00:59:42,889
What's going on?

1051
00:59:42,924 --> 00:59:44,960
You guys see that
fucking guy out there?

1052
00:59:44,995 --> 00:59:46,410
[Stacey] Who?

1053
00:59:46,444 --> 00:59:47,549
Could you stop, there's
nothing out there.

1054
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,757
No, I was just
taking a fucking piss,

1055
00:59:48,792 --> 00:59:50,897
and I see this guy out there,

1056
00:59:50,932 --> 00:59:52,692
he's like, fucking
staring at us.

1057
00:59:52,727 --> 00:59:55,281
- There's nothing out there.
- He's probably just a farmer.

1058
00:59:55,315 --> 00:59:56,213
This is farmland.

1059
00:59:56,247 --> 00:59:58,456
And it's probably just a farmer-

1060
00:59:58,491 --> 01:00:00,148
You've had a lot to drink.

1061
01:00:00,182 --> 01:00:02,426
Yeah, I always have
a fucking lot to drink.

1062
01:00:03,496 --> 01:00:04,739
This guy's staring at you.

1063
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:06,326
He's staring at you,
he's staring at you.

1064
01:00:06,361 --> 01:00:09,019
Drew, dude, honestly,
he's not going to bother us.

1065
01:00:09,053 --> 01:00:11,469
Just come and sit down,
we'll have a drink together.

1066
01:00:11,504 --> 01:00:13,195
Just eat some more burgers.

1067
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:15,819
Man, we're gonna fill
up, it's gonna be nice.

1068
01:00:15,853 --> 01:00:17,890
Don't worry about that guy.

1069
01:00:17,924 --> 01:00:19,546
It's okay.

1070
01:00:19,581 --> 01:00:21,548
- It's no big deal.
- Stop, honey.

1071
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:22,791
There's no big deal.

1072
01:00:22,826 --> 01:00:24,068
No, fuck dude. I'm
going over there.

1073
01:00:24,103 --> 01:00:25,242
Drew, don't.

1074
01:00:25,276 --> 01:00:26,519
I'm going out there.

1075
01:00:26,553 --> 01:00:28,072
[everyone speaking
at the same time]

1076
01:00:28,107 --> 01:00:30,419
He's not hurting anything
if there is someone.

1077
01:00:30,454 --> 01:00:31,455
[Ash] We should probably
follow him over there.

1078
01:00:31,489 --> 01:00:32,801
Stop, Drew. Come on.

1079
01:00:32,836 --> 01:00:33,906
- No!
- Drew.

1080
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:36,080
- Let him go.
- I'm going.

1081
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:39,739
I'm going.
- Go around the barn.

1082
01:00:39,774 --> 01:00:42,086
If you're gonna go over there

1083
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:45,642
and get yourself fucking
arrested, asshole.

1084
01:00:55,962 --> 01:00:56,894
[Ash] Okay. Somebody does
need to get cameras on.

1085
01:00:56,929 --> 01:00:58,447
There is somebody out there.

1086
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,002
There is somebody out there.

1087
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:06,732
[Drew] Hey man, what's up?

1088
01:01:08,803 --> 01:01:10,011
What's up dude.

1089
01:01:12,565 --> 01:01:14,325
[Ash] Did you see
that? Did you see that?

1090
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,950
[Drew speaks indistinctly]

1091
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:23,058
The fuck.

1092
01:01:25,785 --> 01:01:27,960
You guys, by the way,
nobody go out there, okay?

1093
01:01:32,758 --> 01:01:33,966
When also Sean
and Stacey told us

1094
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,761
that this is also
not their land.

1095
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:37,659
What the fuck is that?

1096
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:40,938
Is he coming back?

1097
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:53,123
Where the fuck's
the other guy at?

1098
01:01:54,331 --> 01:01:56,057
Is anybody catching the
other fucking person

1099
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:57,334
on their camera?

1100
01:01:57,368 --> 01:01:58,576
Could someone please
fucking answer me?

1101
01:01:58,611 --> 01:02:01,165
[Chanell] I don't
see the other guy.

1102
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,477
[Ash] I'm not seeing a
goddamn thing out there.

1103
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:04,410
Where the fuck did
the other guy go?

1104
01:02:05,825 --> 01:02:06,792
Did he fucking punch him?

1105
01:02:06,826 --> 01:02:08,034
Is he laying down there?

1106
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:09,726
[Chanell] Drew,
where's the other guy?

1107
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:15,593
[Brett] You okay?

1108
01:02:15,628 --> 01:02:18,700
[Ash] I don't know
what's going on.

1109
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:23,153
Okay. Something's not right.

1110
01:02:25,914 --> 01:02:26,743
Drew?

1111
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:29,504
You know where you're at?

1112
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:31,609
You know what? You need
to go get Tasha now.

1113
01:02:31,644 --> 01:02:32,507
Now.

1114
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:34,129
[Chanelle] Tasha!

1115
01:02:39,928 --> 01:02:42,206
You know, it's weird because

1116
01:02:42,241 --> 01:02:44,588
you have some of
these things on video.

1117
01:02:44,622 --> 01:02:47,729
We have some of these
things that we recorded.

1118
01:02:48,868 --> 01:02:52,354
And in my mind's
eye, my mind's eye,

1119
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:57,394
it's so sort of hazy that...

1120
01:02:58,602 --> 01:03:01,294
you almost have to try
to remember the footage

1121
01:03:02,675 --> 01:03:06,713
more so than your
memory, which is strange,

1122
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:10,890
and I think it's because
it's just so bizarre.

1123
01:03:10,925 --> 01:03:15,481
Yeah, there was very clearly
there was a figure there.

1124
01:03:19,347 --> 01:03:22,660
And then there wasn't
and we all three saw it.

1125
01:03:22,695 --> 01:03:27,665
We all three were
experiencing the same thing.

1126
01:03:33,085 --> 01:03:34,155
I can't explain it.

1127
01:03:38,745 --> 01:03:41,231
Drew. We need to
know if you're okay.

1128
01:03:41,265 --> 01:03:42,059
Hey Drew.

1129
01:03:43,026 --> 01:03:44,682
Drew.

1130
01:03:44,717 --> 01:03:46,201
Can we talk about what
happened up there?

1131
01:03:46,236 --> 01:03:50,240
Because I'm not seeing the
other guy out there at all.

1132
01:03:50,274 --> 01:03:52,276
And I'm afraid that
you did something.

1133
01:03:54,106 --> 01:03:56,936
We need to know because
we've got this all on camera.

1134
01:03:56,971 --> 01:04:00,491
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1135
01:04:00,526 --> 01:04:03,080
You need to calm down.

1136
01:04:03,115 --> 01:04:07,533
You need to calm down and tell
us what happened out there.

1137
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:10,916
Please calm down and
tell us what happened.

1138
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:11,744
Drew!

1139
01:04:13,263 --> 01:04:14,471
He's scaring me.

1140
01:04:14,505 --> 01:04:15,990
Drew, you're scaring me.

1141
01:04:16,024 --> 01:04:17,577
[Brett] Can we at least just
get him up over here. Okay.

1142
01:04:17,612 --> 01:04:19,131
[Tasha] Stop it. Just relax.

1143
01:04:21,374 --> 01:04:24,032
- What the fuck is going on?
- Please stop.

1144
01:04:24,067 --> 01:04:25,275
[Ash] Steady your breathing.

1145
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:28,312
[Tasha] Drew you're
fucking scaring me.

1146
01:04:28,347 --> 01:04:30,418
[Sean] Tasha, I'm
calling the cops.

1147
01:04:30,452 --> 01:04:32,385
You know he has a warrant!

1148
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:33,559
[Sean] He needs help.

1149
01:04:33,593 --> 01:04:34,353
[Stacey] We can't call the cops.

1150
01:04:34,387 --> 01:04:36,320
You can't do that.

1151
01:04:36,355 --> 01:04:37,494
Stop, Drew.

1152
01:04:37,528 --> 01:04:39,116
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Help him!

1153
01:04:39,151 --> 01:04:40,531
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, my God.

1154
01:04:41,463 --> 01:04:44,052
Oh, my God.
[Drew coughing]

1155
01:04:44,087 --> 01:04:45,088
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1156
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:48,954
Oh. Oh, my God.

1157
01:04:48,988 --> 01:04:50,196
[Brett] What? What the fuck?

1158
01:04:50,231 --> 01:04:51,853
[Chanell] All
right. Why is it?

1159
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,131
What's up with the color?

1160
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:55,512
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my God.

1161
01:04:55,546 --> 01:04:58,687
[Drew grunting]

1162
01:04:58,722 --> 01:05:03,002
I don't know how to explain...

1163
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:09,836
how I know it's real.

1164
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:14,393
So, there's no doubt
in your mind right now.

1165
01:05:14,427 --> 01:05:17,603
There's no doubt.
No doubt at all.

1166
01:05:17,637 --> 01:05:20,295
[ominous music]

1167
01:05:43,008 --> 01:05:47,460
What's up man, I didn't
even see you come out.

1168
01:05:47,495 --> 01:05:48,323
Ash?

1169
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:34,611
Ash?

1170
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,168
Ash?

1171
01:06:49,695 --> 01:06:52,215
[Interviewer] Why do
you think that Brett

1172
01:06:52,249 --> 01:06:54,493
didn't show you these videos?

1173
01:06:55,873 --> 01:07:00,844
I think Brett's experience
was very different

1174
01:07:02,432 --> 01:07:06,056
from my experience and
from Chanell's experience.

1175
01:07:07,506 --> 01:07:12,407
And, I think Brett
was going through

1176
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:14,720
something very personal.

1177
01:07:17,343 --> 01:07:20,967
Something very
specific and singular.

1178
01:07:21,002 --> 01:07:23,591
[somber music]

1179
01:07:36,914 --> 01:07:39,262
No. No.

1180
01:07:40,608 --> 01:07:41,954
These things?

1181
01:07:41,988 --> 01:07:43,507
Well, let me make
something abundantly clear.

1182
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:46,269
These things were not human.

1183
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:49,720
They were not of this
Earth, of this planet.

1184
01:07:50,963 --> 01:07:53,621
What they wanted me to see.

1185
01:07:56,072 --> 01:08:00,006
It's like an actor, when
you're watching a show,

1186
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:02,768
you see an actor
break character,

1187
01:08:02,802 --> 01:08:05,633
whether it's like a
skit comedy or just

1188
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:08,222
behind the scenes
on like a movie.

1189
01:08:08,256 --> 01:08:10,500
And you see them break
character for a second,

1190
01:08:10,534 --> 01:08:14,193
you're pull away, you're
pulled out of the moment

1191
01:08:14,228 --> 01:08:16,575
that they're trying
to bring to you,

1192
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:18,715
whether it's comedy
or drama or whatever.

1193
01:08:18,749 --> 01:08:19,957
You're pulled out
of that moment.

1194
01:08:19,992 --> 01:08:22,339
You realize that it's
fake. It's a facade.

1195
01:08:23,823 --> 01:08:28,242
That facade, these faces of
these people that I'm seeing.

1196
01:08:34,938 --> 01:08:39,874
They were real people
for me at first.

1197
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:42,394
It was something for me to
hold on to as an anchor.

1198
01:08:44,706 --> 01:08:48,365
And it was a way
for me to feel safe.

1199
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:52,887
And then for a brief
moment, that facade dropped.

1200
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:55,338
And I was completely...

1201
01:08:56,477 --> 01:08:57,926
my mind can't even comprehend

1202
01:08:57,961 --> 01:09:00,032
the horror that you would see,

1203
01:09:00,066 --> 01:09:03,587
the ability for life
around me to be distorted,

1204
01:09:03,622 --> 01:09:06,452
my safety to crumble around me.

1205
01:09:06,487 --> 01:09:09,455
And what I saw.

1206
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:11,699
The more I hold on to that
and the more they realize

1207
01:09:11,733 --> 01:09:12,803
that I was holding on to that,

1208
01:09:12,838 --> 01:09:14,978
the more they ripped that away,

1209
01:09:15,012 --> 01:09:18,430
and the less I can
even remember now.

1210
01:09:19,672 --> 01:09:24,401
I feel insane thinking
that these things

1211
01:09:24,436 --> 01:09:28,025
were anything but
just a bad memory.

1212
01:09:32,444 --> 01:09:37,414
It's like, losing
pieces of myself.

1213
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:08,031
[Ash] Okay. Now, this
is looking pretty good.

1214
01:10:09,343 --> 01:10:11,103
So if you could please
give us your name,

1215
01:10:11,137 --> 01:10:13,761
your age, and your
occupation, please.

1216
01:10:13,795 --> 01:10:15,280
My name is Brenda Floyd.

1217
01:10:15,314 --> 01:10:19,698
I'm 53 years old and I am
a regression therapist.

1218
01:10:19,732 --> 01:10:22,183
In addition to being
a shamanic minister,

1219
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:25,773
a Reiki practitioner and
a breath work facilitator.

1220
01:10:26,946 --> 01:10:28,154
[Ash] You work with people

1221
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:29,363
who are trying to
remember things

1222
01:10:29,397 --> 01:10:32,124
that obviously are
very painful for them.

1223
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:36,024
Can you speak a little bit
about your experiences there?

1224
01:10:36,059 --> 01:10:39,752
Well, in my experience, when
people have blocks like that,

1225
01:10:39,787 --> 01:10:43,929
it is due to some sort
of trauma in their life.

1226
01:10:43,963 --> 01:10:45,448
It can be from childhood.

1227
01:10:45,482 --> 01:10:47,519
It can be from a past life.

1228
01:10:47,553 --> 01:10:49,452
It can be from
current situations.

1229
01:10:49,486 --> 01:10:52,524
But it is usually
some form of PTSD.

1230
01:11:01,498 --> 01:11:03,120
Want you to take a
nice deep breath.

1231
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:09,299
Just listen to my voice.

1232
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,993
Wherever we go on this
journey, you will be safe

1233
01:11:14,028 --> 01:11:16,099
if you just listen to my voice.

1234
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:21,069
[gentle music]

1235
01:11:26,316 --> 01:11:29,457
Sean, I want you to
think about a time

1236
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:35,221
or remember a time
in July of 2013.

1237
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:43,368
I don't want to.

1238
01:11:43,402 --> 01:11:44,990
[Brenda] Why not?

1239
01:11:48,407 --> 01:11:49,270
It hurts.

1240
01:11:51,548 --> 01:11:55,172
[Brenda] Can you
see anything, Sean?

1241
01:11:55,207 --> 01:11:56,760
Colors? Structures?

1242
01:12:02,628 --> 01:12:04,665
It's hot. Humid inside.

1243
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:18,403
[Brenda] Are you alone?
Are you with other people?

1244
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:21,992
[Ash] Just keep going.

1245
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,133
There's others.

1246
01:12:25,168 --> 01:12:25,996
Stacey.

1247
01:12:27,722 --> 01:12:28,792
Mostly myself.

1248
01:12:30,415 --> 01:12:31,519
[Ash] I'm almost done.

1249
01:12:31,554 --> 01:12:33,245
Seriously, it's almost done...

1250
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,904
[Brenda] In mid-July. 2013,
do remember where you were?

1251
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,085
[Ash] I got nothing.
Dude, I'm out.

1252
01:12:47,086 --> 01:12:48,294
[Brett] I'm out too.

1253
01:12:48,329 --> 01:12:50,158
[indistinct]

1254
01:12:50,193 --> 01:12:51,263
[Sean] We're fighting.

1255
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:54,818
Arguing.

1256
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:57,511
[Brenda] Do you remember

1257
01:12:57,545 --> 01:13:00,030
what you were
arguing about, Sean?

1258
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,725
[exhales] Our time together.

1259
01:13:04,759 --> 01:13:06,382
She's mad.

1260
01:13:07,693 --> 01:13:09,385
We're not connecting.

1261
01:13:11,317 --> 01:13:12,111
Not like we were.

1262
01:13:13,354 --> 01:13:16,702
[Brenda] Is there a
reason for that Sean?

1263
01:13:20,672 --> 01:13:22,812
They're the reason.

1264
01:13:22,846 --> 01:13:24,089
I blame myself.

1265
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:32,235
[Brenda speaking indistinctly]

1266
01:13:32,269 --> 01:13:34,410
[Ash] Chanell, I'm
getting a strong breeze,

1267
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:36,170
coming through here, you
need to watch those candles.

1268
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:43,488
[Sean] We fight.

1269
01:13:46,767 --> 01:13:47,940
I leave..

1270
01:13:47,975 --> 01:13:50,633
[static buzzes]

1271
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:57,950
[Brenda] Sean, can you
tell me where you went?

1272
01:13:57,985 --> 01:13:59,504
I, I left.

1273
01:13:59,538 --> 01:14:01,195
I don't know where I went.

1274
01:14:02,576 --> 01:14:05,682
[Brenda] Can you look
around and see where you are?

1275
01:14:05,717 --> 01:14:08,996
There's lights. There's...

1276
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:10,549
They're following me in the car.

1277
01:14:12,724 --> 01:14:14,484
[Brenda] You're
in your car driving.

1278
01:14:15,623 --> 01:14:17,314
I think.

1279
01:14:18,384 --> 01:14:19,455
I can't tell.

1280
01:14:20,594 --> 01:14:22,112
I can't feel the wheel.

1281
01:14:22,147 --> 01:14:24,839
The lights are
getting so bright.

1282
01:14:24,874 --> 01:14:25,840
Can you look through the light?

1283
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:27,186
- No.
- See past the light.

1284
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:30,362
They don't want me to.

1285
01:14:30,396 --> 01:14:32,951
- Who's "they"?
- I'm trying to.

1286
01:14:32,985 --> 01:14:34,504
[Brenda] Who's "they" Sean?

1287
01:14:34,539 --> 01:14:37,024
They don't want me to know.

1288
01:14:37,058 --> 01:14:38,819
Can you look at
their faces, Sean.

1289
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:43,375
No, they don't.

1290
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:47,448
[Brenda] Can you tell me
what they look like Sean?

1291
01:14:49,795 --> 01:14:51,279
I'll try to see, but.

1292
01:14:53,558 --> 01:14:55,560
[Brenda] Show me their faces.

1293
01:14:55,594 --> 01:14:57,251
They won't let me.

1294
01:14:59,046 --> 01:15:00,254
Ah!

1295
01:15:00,288 --> 01:15:01,600
[Brenda] Try to relax
Sean. Try to relax.

1296
01:15:01,635 --> 01:15:03,188
Take a deep breath.

1297
01:15:03,222 --> 01:15:04,500
You're okay.
- There.

1298
01:15:04,534 --> 01:15:05,328
They're here.

1299
01:15:05,362 --> 01:15:08,400
[electronic distortion]

1300
01:15:08,434 --> 01:15:09,815
[Sean groans]

1301
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:11,610
[Brenda] What's wrong with him?

1302
01:15:11,645 --> 01:15:14,924
[Ash] Keep going.
Keep going, dude.

1303
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:17,513
[Sean roaring]

1304
01:15:20,446 --> 01:15:21,240
Brenda.

1305
01:15:22,725 --> 01:15:23,726
Brenda, seriously.

1306
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,106
Hey, hey, hey.

1307
01:15:25,141 --> 01:15:25,935
I just need you.

1308
01:15:25,969 --> 01:15:27,246
Just come inside.

1309
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:28,593
Just sign a couple
of consent forms.

1310
01:15:28,627 --> 01:15:30,215
I don't know what
the fuck that was,

1311
01:15:30,249 --> 01:15:31,630
but I'm fucking out of here.

1312
01:15:35,047 --> 01:15:36,842
[Ash] Ahhh, fuck me.

1313
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:48,854
So looking back, Chanell, if
you could have done anything

1314
01:15:48,889 --> 01:15:50,925
differently, what
would you have changed?

1315
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:53,652
We would have left.

1316
01:15:53,687 --> 01:15:56,897
We would have left
earlier or left before

1317
01:15:59,209 --> 01:16:03,455
the shit hit the fan,
before, all of that happened,

1318
01:16:06,147 --> 01:16:07,355
we would have left.

1319
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:11,981
We would have talked
Ash into leaving

1320
01:16:12,015 --> 01:16:16,157
and not staying to
get the best footage.

1321
01:16:20,023 --> 01:16:21,024
We would have left.

1322
01:16:22,232 --> 01:16:24,545
We would have all
gotten to leave.

1323
01:16:25,995 --> 01:16:27,168
[Interviewer] But then
you wouldn't have had

1324
01:16:27,203 --> 01:16:28,791
what you have.

1325
01:16:28,825 --> 01:16:33,589
And maybe we wouldn't
have lost what we lost too.

1326
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:36,177
[somber music]

1327
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:51,572
So that fifth day, we were
just, it was a workhorse day.

1328
01:16:52,711 --> 01:16:54,817
I mean, it was all about
like, we need to get

1329
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:56,681
all the shots we didn't get.

1330
01:16:56,715 --> 01:16:59,200
We need to get any interview
questions we didn't get.

1331
01:16:59,235 --> 01:17:00,788
So it was all about
pick up, pick up,

1332
01:17:00,823 --> 01:17:03,204
pick up, pick up, all day long.

1333
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:07,174
And I think we didn't even
realize how late we were there.

1334
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:11,557
And so we started to
sort of break down.

1335
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:16,528
And at that point, I think
we also sort of realized

1336
01:17:17,909 --> 01:17:20,221
that we were there too late.

1337
01:17:20,256 --> 01:17:23,086
And I mean, we were all
struck with that feeling.

1338
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:25,226
It wasn't just that
we were there late

1339
01:17:25,261 --> 01:17:27,435
and we were ready to take off.

1340
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:29,506
We were there too late.

1341
01:17:33,234 --> 01:17:34,719
There's nothing that
we don't know about,

1342
01:17:34,753 --> 01:17:36,203
nothing that we can't see.

1343
01:17:36,237 --> 01:17:38,930
[Brett] I need the lights
and I need the keys to the van.

1344
01:17:38,964 --> 01:17:40,414
[Ash] Okay.

1345
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:42,588
Do you want to go ahead
and take that last bag out?

1346
01:17:42,623 --> 01:17:45,661
Put the lights and the
rest of the lenses away.

1347
01:17:45,695 --> 01:17:46,903
[Brett] All right.

1348
01:17:46,938 --> 01:17:49,319
I'll be back to get
the rest of the shit.

1349
01:17:55,187 --> 01:17:56,637
[Brett] Goddamn.

1350
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,398
[speaks indistinctly]

1351
01:17:59,433 --> 01:18:02,332
[foreboding music]

1352
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:06,198
[car doors opening]

1353
01:18:06,233 --> 01:18:09,063
[gear clattering]

1354
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:13,378
What the fuck is that?

1355
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,600
Hey, hey, hey.

1356
01:18:28,634 --> 01:18:30,291
Shut the lights off.

1357
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,812
Is that on?

1358
01:18:33,847 --> 01:18:34,640
Is that on?

1359
01:18:34,675 --> 01:18:35,503
C'mere.

1360
01:18:38,644 --> 01:18:40,474
Come here.
- What's up?

1361
01:18:41,682 --> 01:18:43,097
[Ash] Can I at least
turn my camera on?

1362
01:18:43,132 --> 01:18:46,929
[Brett speaking indistinctly]

1363
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:50,173
[Brett] What the
fuck is out there?

1364
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:52,831
You see that?
- The lights on the horizon.

1365
01:18:52,866 --> 01:18:55,351
[indistinct whispering]

1366
01:18:55,385 --> 01:18:58,423
[Ash] Okay, I have no
fucking idea what that is.

1367
01:19:02,807 --> 01:19:04,878
I'm going to actually
find the flashlight.

1368
01:19:07,294 --> 01:19:09,434
Do we know where
the flashlight is?

1369
01:19:09,468 --> 01:19:11,022
We were going to
find it earlier.

1370
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:15,233
Course I'm going out there.

1371
01:19:15,267 --> 01:19:16,441
I've got a camera and
I've got a flashlight.

1372
01:19:16,475 --> 01:19:18,581
So that's what I'm doing.

1373
01:19:21,377 --> 01:19:24,587
[Chanelle] Can you
just give me a minute?

1374
01:19:24,621 --> 01:19:26,520
[Ash] I'm going out.

1375
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:28,867
- No. Don't go out there.
- Ash! Ash!

1376
01:19:28,902 --> 01:19:30,835
[Ash] I'm going out.

1377
01:19:30,869 --> 01:19:33,769
[foreboding music]

1378
01:19:42,501 --> 01:19:46,264
[Chanelle] I don't
understand why he's gotta dive

1379
01:19:46,298 --> 01:19:47,955
right into these things.

1380
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:52,166
[Brett] What the fuck
do you think that is?

1381
01:19:52,201 --> 01:19:53,133
Look at it!

1382
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:02,625
See it?

1383
01:20:10,253 --> 01:20:13,981
[foreboding music continues]

1384
01:20:57,231 --> 01:20:58,474
[Ash] Holy fucking shit.

1385
01:20:59,578 --> 01:21:02,719
Shit!
[being screams]

1386
01:21:11,314 --> 01:21:13,799
[Ash panting]

1387
01:21:16,354 --> 01:21:17,251
Oh, my God.

1388
01:21:20,945 --> 01:21:22,429
You gotta tell Stacey.

1389
01:21:22,463 --> 01:21:24,293
She's gotta call, she's got
to call the fucking cops.

1390
01:21:24,327 --> 01:21:25,950
She's gotta to call 911.

1391
01:21:25,984 --> 01:21:27,744
She's got to do it now.
- What is it?

1392
01:21:27,779 --> 01:21:30,333
[Ash] She's got to do it now.

1393
01:21:31,817 --> 01:21:35,925
[Interviewer] So tell me,
Eric, this has been dubbed

1394
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:39,584
or coined the alliteration
of the Miller monster.

1395
01:21:39,618 --> 01:21:40,516
Do you know how?

1396
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:43,001
Who started that? Do you know?

1397
01:21:43,036 --> 01:21:45,176
I'm not sure where
that came from.

1398
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:48,282
Once the snippet came out
and the face came out,

1399
01:21:48,317 --> 01:21:50,146
people started dubbing
it the Miller Monster.

1400
01:21:50,181 --> 01:21:53,943
I'm not sure who exactly
coined that phrase,

1401
01:21:53,978 --> 01:21:56,842
but it's it's been around
for a little while now.

1402
01:21:58,292 --> 01:22:00,916
[pensive music]

1403
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,858
[Dispatcher] 911.
What's your emergency?

1404
01:22:12,893 --> 01:22:15,378
[Stacey] We need
someone here immediately.

1405
01:22:15,413 --> 01:22:16,862
There are people there.

1406
01:22:16,897 --> 01:22:19,210
There's a lot of people
trying to get into my house.

1407
01:22:19,244 --> 01:22:21,384
[Dispatcher] Okay.
How many people, ma'am?

1408
01:22:21,419 --> 01:22:22,661
[Stacey] I don't know.

1409
01:22:22,696 --> 01:22:24,077
I don't know how many
people there's just...

1410
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:25,837
I don't know.

1411
01:22:25,871 --> 01:22:28,046
[Dispatcher] Are they
inside the house, ma'am.

1412
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:29,806
[Stacey] No. We have
people inside the house,

1413
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:30,842
there's about five of us.

1414
01:22:30,876 --> 01:22:32,257
You guys, where's Sean?

1415
01:22:32,292 --> 01:22:33,396
Where is Sean?

1416
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:36,917
We need someone here.

1417
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,643
[Dispatcher] Okay, ma'am,

1418
01:22:38,677 --> 01:22:40,783
can you give me
your address, ma'am?

1419
01:22:40,817 --> 01:22:41,749
[Stacey] We're at [beep].

1420
01:22:43,579 --> 01:22:44,787
[Dispatcher] Okay, Ma'am.

1421
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:46,064
I need you to stay
on the line with me.

1422
01:22:46,099 --> 01:22:47,238
I need you to tell
me what's going on.

1423
01:22:47,272 --> 01:22:48,446
[Stacey] You
guys, where is Sean?

1424
01:22:50,241 --> 01:22:53,451
I've been looking
outside, I don't know.

1425
01:22:53,485 --> 01:22:54,452
I don't know.

1426
01:22:54,486 --> 01:22:55,832
I don't know.

1427
01:22:55,867 --> 01:22:57,144
[Stacey] What do you
mean, you don't know?

1428
01:22:57,179 --> 01:22:58,801
[Ash] Because we
haven't seen him.

1429
01:22:58,835 --> 01:23:01,010
We thought he might
have been outside.

1430
01:23:01,045 --> 01:23:03,185
I can't see-
- There are people outside!

1431
01:23:03,219 --> 01:23:04,841
[Ash] Brett, can
you see anything?

1432
01:23:04,876 --> 01:23:06,464
[Brett] No, I haven't.

1433
01:23:06,498 --> 01:23:08,466
[Ash] So let's just
get the doors locked.

1434
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,399
[Dispatcher] Ma'am,
can you stay...

1435
01:23:10,433 --> 01:23:11,469
I need you to stay
on the line with me.

1436
01:23:11,503 --> 01:23:12,608
Tell me what's going on.
- It's okay.

1437
01:23:12,642 --> 01:23:14,023
I don't know.

1438
01:23:14,058 --> 01:23:15,404
When I look out the window,
there's just lights.

1439
01:23:15,438 --> 01:23:16,853
There's lights.

1440
01:23:16,888 --> 01:23:18,683
[Dispatcher] What kind
of lights are there?

1441
01:23:18,717 --> 01:23:19,753
[Stacey] They're bright.

1442
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:22,687
- Okay.
- But what is that noise?

1443
01:23:22,721 --> 01:23:24,792
There's people on my roof.

1444
01:23:24,827 --> 01:23:26,898
They're trying to get it in.

1445
01:23:26,932 --> 01:23:29,107
[Dispatcher] Alright,
ma'am, just stay calm.

1446
01:23:29,142 --> 01:23:30,833
I need you to stay
calm, ma'am, alright?

1447
01:23:30,867 --> 01:23:32,145
[Ash] So, they're
not going outside.

1448
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:33,525
[Stacey] Then,
I'm going outside.

1449
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:34,768
[Ash] You can't go outside.

1450
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:35,562
[Stacey] You have
to let me go outside.

1451
01:23:35,596 --> 01:23:37,564
We have to get Sean!

1452
01:23:37,598 --> 01:23:39,014
[Dispatcher] I need
you to calm down ma'am.

1453
01:23:39,048 --> 01:23:41,464
I need you to stay on
the phone with me, ma'am.

1454
01:23:41,499 --> 01:23:43,466
[Stacey] We need help.

1455
01:23:44,743 --> 01:23:47,436
I'm Paul Stenson, I'm 55.

1456
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:48,954
I'm a retired sheriff's deputy

1457
01:23:48,989 --> 01:23:50,887
with [beep]
sheriff's department.

1458
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:54,581
I was there for 22 years.

1459
01:23:54,615 --> 01:23:57,239
And now I'm a man of leisure.

1460
01:24:02,278 --> 01:24:04,004
[Interviewer] So you
were called in that night

1461
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:08,767
of the 911 call, here to the
Miller residence, correct?

1462
01:24:08,802 --> 01:24:09,699
That is correct.

1463
01:24:13,565 --> 01:24:15,015
[Ash] That was a fucking window.

1464
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,328
That was a window
that just broke.

1465
01:24:17,362 --> 01:24:18,329
[Stacey] Then I'm getting Sean.

1466
01:24:18,363 --> 01:24:19,502
I'm going outside.

1467
01:24:19,537 --> 01:24:20,952
No, you cant do it.

1468
01:24:20,986 --> 01:24:25,370
[everyone speaks indistinctly]

1469
01:24:25,405 --> 01:24:26,337
[Chanelle] No, no, you can't.

1470
01:24:26,371 --> 01:24:28,270
You need to stay inside.

1471
01:24:28,304 --> 01:24:30,237
[Stacey] We have to get Sean.

1472
01:24:30,272 --> 01:24:32,274
[Chanelle] You
need to calm down.

1473
01:24:32,308 --> 01:24:33,861
[Stacey] No, there
is no calming down.

1474
01:24:33,896 --> 01:24:35,173
What don't you understand?

1475
01:24:36,278 --> 01:24:37,624
You guys need to get here.

1476
01:24:37,658 --> 01:24:40,730
No, I can't stay calm.

1477
01:24:40,765 --> 01:24:42,870
[Dispatcher] I'm
trying to help you ma'am.

1478
01:24:42,905 --> 01:24:44,872
[Stacey] You
guys, that was Sean.

1479
01:24:44,907 --> 01:24:48,013
- I need you to stay calm.
- Do you hear him?

1480
01:24:48,048 --> 01:24:49,636
No, I'm going to go get him.

1481
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:50,844
He's outside.

1482
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:51,672
No I'm done.

1483
01:24:51,707 --> 01:24:52,673
I'm done. I'm going.

1484
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:54,537
[Chanell] No! No! Stacey!

1485
01:24:54,572 --> 01:24:57,540
No, no Stacey, you
can't go! Stacey!

1486
01:24:58,576 --> 01:25:00,681
You can't go outside.

1487
01:25:00,716 --> 01:25:02,269
[everyone speaking
at the same time]

1488
01:25:02,304 --> 01:25:03,581
[Dispatcher] Is someone there?

1489
01:25:03,615 --> 01:25:05,030
[Chanelle] Yeah, I'm here.

1490
01:25:05,065 --> 01:25:05,859
I'm here.

1491
01:25:05,893 --> 01:25:08,655
[Stacey screams]

1492
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:14,350
She's on the ground.
She's unconscious.

1493
01:25:14,385 --> 01:25:16,283
She touched the door-
- Ambulance on the way.

1494
01:25:16,318 --> 01:25:17,802
[Chanell] She touched the door

1495
01:25:17,836 --> 01:25:22,358
and then she flew across the
room, and she's on the floor.

1496
01:25:23,532 --> 01:25:24,636
[Dispatcher] I'll
have ambulances.

1497
01:25:24,671 --> 01:25:26,949
I'll have an ambulance
dispatched...

1498
01:25:28,261 --> 01:25:31,333
medical personnel
are on the way.

1499
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:32,575
We have several units in route.

1500
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:34,267
[Chanell] How long?

1501
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:35,751
[Dispatcher] Five minutes.

1502
01:25:35,785 --> 01:25:36,269
[Chanell] Five minutes? He
said they'll come in 5 minutes.

1503
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:40,894
- We don't have 5 minutes.
- We don't have a choice!

1504
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:42,067
[Chanell] Can you
tell them to go faster?

1505
01:25:43,655 --> 01:25:44,863
[Dispatcher] I
cannot rush personnel.

1506
01:25:44,898 --> 01:25:48,971
They're going as fast
as they're going, ma'am.

1507
01:25:49,005 --> 01:25:50,421
I don't know what's going on.

1508
01:25:50,455 --> 01:25:53,976
They're outside and they've
surrounded the house.

1509
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:58,325
[everyone speaking
at the same time]

1510
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,156
And there's electric
shocks coming out.

1511
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:03,882
[people speaking indistinctly]

1512
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:07,714
[Dispather] I think I
almost lost you ma'am.

1513
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,751
[people speaking indistinctly]

1514
01:26:10,786 --> 01:26:12,581
[Chanell] We need you here.

1515
01:26:12,615 --> 01:26:14,962
You need to be here.

1516
01:26:14,997 --> 01:26:17,689
[people speaking indistinctly]

1517
01:26:17,724 --> 01:26:18,621
No, and now he's
going to go outside.

1518
01:26:18,656 --> 01:26:19,622
No, you can't go outside!

1519
01:26:19,657 --> 01:26:20,865
No, don't go outside.

1520
01:26:20,899 --> 01:26:22,280
[Dispatcher] Don't let
anybody go out there.

1521
01:26:22,315 --> 01:26:23,385
[Chanell] Don't go outside.

1522
01:26:23,419 --> 01:26:26,111
They said don't go outside.

1523
01:26:26,146 --> 01:26:28,148
You can't go outside. No, no.

1524
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,322
[Brett] Then we'll go both go.

1525
01:26:29,356 --> 01:26:32,704
[Chanell] No,
neither of you will go.

1526
01:26:32,739 --> 01:26:33,981
You can't go outside.

1527
01:26:34,016 --> 01:26:35,500
[Dispatcher] They need
to stay in the house.

1528
01:26:35,535 --> 01:26:37,261
[Chanell] They said you
need to stay in the house.

1529
01:26:37,295 --> 01:26:39,884
[Dispatcher] We need
to be able to identify

1530
01:26:39,918 --> 01:26:41,713
who is a threat and who is not.

1531
01:26:41,748 --> 01:26:45,061
- You have to stay in because-
- Ma'am, who are you?

1532
01:26:45,096 --> 01:26:47,340
I'm Chanell, Chanell Hamilton.

1533
01:26:47,374 --> 01:26:51,689
[Man] Okay, and how are
you related to the caller?

1534
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:54,450
We're with the film crew.

1535
01:26:54,485 --> 01:26:58,627
We're filming a documentary
about Stacey and Sean.

1536
01:27:00,387 --> 01:27:03,459
[Man] Okay, and where
did the caller go, ma'am?

1537
01:27:03,494 --> 01:27:06,945
[Chanell] She tried to
go outside to find Sean.

1538
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:11,881
And then she touched the door
and she flew across the room

1539
01:27:12,503 --> 01:27:14,263
She got pushed.

1540
01:27:14,298 --> 01:27:18,992
She, almost like there was
electricity in the door handle.

1541
01:27:19,026 --> 01:27:22,478
[static buzzing]

1542
01:27:22,513 --> 01:27:25,516
[Man] She needs medical
attention as well.

1543
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:26,965
Chanell, get down!

1544
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,969
- What else is going on-
- They're on the fucking roof!

1545
01:27:31,004 --> 01:27:33,627
Dammit, Brett. I'm
fucking sorry, man.

1546
01:27:33,662 --> 01:27:34,559
Dude, don't be sorry.

1547
01:27:34,594 --> 01:27:35,733
I choose to fucking be here.

1548
01:27:35,767 --> 01:27:37,976
We're all here because
we wanted to be.

1549
01:27:38,011 --> 01:27:40,013
No, I'm fucking sorry.

1550
01:27:41,497 --> 01:27:43,050
This is a shit time to say it,

1551
01:27:43,085 --> 01:27:44,362
but I don't know when
I'm gonna get a chance.

1552
01:27:44,397 --> 01:27:45,605
But I'm fucking sorry.

1553
01:27:45,639 --> 01:27:48,263
I am sorry that
I didn't tell you

1554
01:27:50,195 --> 01:27:53,716
we fucking missed you,
we missed you and Angie,

1555
01:27:53,751 --> 01:27:56,029
and we fucking miss David, too.

1556
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:59,895
And I didn't say anything 'cause
you were so goddamned hurt

1557
01:27:59,929 --> 01:28:02,794
and I should have because
you needed to know

1558
01:28:02,829 --> 01:28:04,348
how much everybody loved them,

1559
01:28:04,382 --> 01:28:06,453
because you loved him
so goddamned much.

1560
01:28:06,488 --> 01:28:09,422
But everybody loved him and
Chanell and I loved him.

1561
01:28:09,456 --> 01:28:11,493
And goddamn it, I'm
just fucking sorry

1562
01:28:11,527 --> 01:28:14,012
I didn't say anything earlier.

1563
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:21,296
Brett just fucking
left. Brett, goddamn it!

1564
01:28:22,435 --> 01:28:23,643
[Chanell] Please don't
go outside with him.

1565
01:28:23,677 --> 01:28:24,851
[Ash] I gotta go.
He may need help.

1566
01:28:24,885 --> 01:28:26,093
- Please don't go.
- I gotta go.

1567
01:28:26,128 --> 01:28:28,095
Ma'am, can you please
keep all the personnel

1568
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:29,890
in the house, please.

1569
01:28:29,925 --> 01:28:32,583
[static buzzes]

1570
01:28:36,794 --> 01:28:39,452
[ominous tones]

1571
01:28:41,143 --> 01:28:46,148
[Ash] Brett!

1572
01:28:49,462 --> 01:28:50,290
Oh God.

1573
01:28:53,362 --> 01:28:55,053
Oh Jesus, Brett!

1574
01:28:55,088 --> 01:28:55,916
Brett!

1575
01:28:56,952 --> 01:28:58,609
Brett! Grab my hand!

1576
01:28:59,989 --> 01:29:01,784
Grab my. I've got you.

1577
01:29:01,819 --> 01:29:03,268
Don't let go.

1578
01:29:03,303 --> 01:29:04,511
Don't let go!

1579
01:29:04,546 --> 01:29:05,719
Brett, you're slipping!

1580
01:29:05,754 --> 01:29:07,514
You're slipping!

1581
01:29:07,549 --> 01:29:09,274
It's okay! It's okay.

1582
01:29:15,211 --> 01:29:18,698
[Dispatcher] Okay, ma'am you
need to get them back inside.

1583
01:29:18,732 --> 01:29:21,356
Units should be there in
the next minute, ma'am.

1584
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:23,358
Status of units?

1585
01:29:23,392 --> 01:29:24,842
Where are the units in progress?

1586
01:29:25,843 --> 01:29:27,603
Ma'am? ma'am are
you still there?

1587
01:29:28,846 --> 01:29:30,123
Ma'am are you still there?

1588
01:29:31,331 --> 01:29:32,608
I think I lost the call.

1589
01:29:33,851 --> 01:29:36,301
What are the status of units?

1590
01:29:36,336 --> 01:29:38,545
We need to send more back up.

1591
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,685
No one is answering right now,

1592
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,687
I'm going to try to call back.

1593
01:29:42,722 --> 01:29:45,380
[phone ringing]

1594
01:30:00,153 --> 01:30:02,189
I'm not getting anything.

1595
01:30:02,224 --> 01:30:03,328
It's just ringing.

1596
01:30:03,363 --> 01:30:04,433
I'm not getting anything.

1597
01:30:04,468 --> 01:30:06,124
No one's picking up.

1598
01:30:11,371 --> 01:30:12,855
[Interviewer] You've
been reported as saying

1599
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:15,513
that there's never going to
be a resolution to this case.

1600
01:30:15,548 --> 01:30:17,895
Is that still your position?

1601
01:30:17,929 --> 01:30:19,862
I couldn't find anything

1602
01:30:19,897 --> 01:30:21,692
and I was the first
one on the scene.

1603
01:30:25,178 --> 01:30:27,525
It defies rational explanation.

1604
01:30:34,359 --> 01:30:38,398
I can't even begin
to comment on that.

1605
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,477
[Interviewer] Ash, I
think it's important for us

1606
01:30:48,512 --> 01:30:51,860
to understand, what would
you say to Brett's family?

1607
01:30:57,348 --> 01:31:02,318
I talk, I try to
talk to Brett's family.

1608
01:31:03,803 --> 01:31:08,014
I have tried numerous times
to talk to Brett's family.

1609
01:31:08,048 --> 01:31:12,018
I have tried writing
checks to Brett's family.

1610
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,609
I would say the same thing that
I would say to anybody else.

1611
01:31:18,576 --> 01:31:19,784
Brett was my best friend.

1612
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:23,167
He's still my best friend.

1613
01:31:24,409 --> 01:31:26,204
He's always gonna
be my best friend.

1614
01:31:27,343 --> 01:31:28,655
[Interviewer]
You seem emotional.

1615
01:31:31,624 --> 01:31:33,246
I fucking want him back.

1616
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,765
I want him back.

1617
01:31:34,799 --> 01:31:36,387
Why wouldn't I want him back?

1618
01:31:36,421 --> 01:31:38,182
Why wouldn't I want
my best friend back?

1619
01:31:38,216 --> 01:31:39,666
I'm gonna get emotional.

1620
01:31:39,701 --> 01:31:42,669
I get emotional every
time I think about Brett.

1621
01:31:42,704 --> 01:31:44,706
We had a conversation
before we even went

1622
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,673
into this documentary
where I asked him

1623
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:47,985
if he wanted to sit this out

1624
01:31:48,019 --> 01:31:49,918
and I should have
made him do it,

1625
01:31:49,952 --> 01:31:52,299
because I didn't think
he was up for it then

1626
01:31:52,334 --> 01:31:53,887
and I should have
asked him to sit it out

1627
01:31:53,922 --> 01:31:55,130
and I didn't do it.

1628
01:31:55,164 --> 01:31:56,476
And that's on me and
that's gonna be on me

1629
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,582
every single time
I talk about it.

1630
01:31:58,616 --> 01:32:01,757
Every time I'm asked that
question, it's gonna be on me.

1631
01:32:01,792 --> 01:32:04,104
It's gonna be on me to
think about the people,

1632
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:07,073
not just beside me,
that's missing him.

1633
01:32:07,107 --> 01:32:09,109
And that's what I got to do.

1634
01:32:09,144 --> 01:32:10,248
That's what I do every time

1635
01:32:10,283 --> 01:32:12,250
people ask me if
I'm being honest

1636
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,288
is I've got to
look at the people

1637
01:32:15,322 --> 01:32:17,704
who aren't around to
defend themselves.

1638
01:32:17,739 --> 01:32:19,534
Brett's not around
to defend himself.

1639
01:32:21,294 --> 01:32:22,778
All I can do.

1640
01:32:22,813 --> 01:32:27,265
All I can do is call people
and try to write checks.

1641
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:33,720
Ineffective, because I can't
tell them what really happened

1642
01:32:34,618 --> 01:32:36,309
and have them believe it.

1643
01:32:36,343 --> 01:32:38,345
[Interviewer] So are they
taking your call at all?

1644
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:41,556
No, nobody's taking my calls.

1645
01:32:42,522 --> 01:32:44,559
You know who's taking my calls?

1646
01:32:44,593 --> 01:32:48,148
People who want my documentary
that I can't even give them.

1647
01:32:48,183 --> 01:32:49,564
That's who's taking my calls.

1648
01:32:50,944 --> 01:32:52,359
That's who's taking my calls.

1649
01:32:53,429 --> 01:32:56,018
