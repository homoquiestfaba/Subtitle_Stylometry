Dr. Grace Hart of Boston.

539
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:52,933
A woman doctor?

540
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:55,766
- What times we live in.
- GRACE: (CHUCKLES) Yes.

541
00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:58,332
In America, we're much more progressive.

542
00:27:58,466 --> 00:28:01,200
I now make 30 cents for
every dollar a man earns.

543
00:28:01,365 --> 00:28:03,899
What does "doctor" mean in America?

544
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:05,733
It means "doctor."

Yes.

Holmes, we're in the
presence of a pioneer.

548
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,066
Dr. Hart's work with the use
of electroshock therapy

549
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,432
to cure female hysteria
is groundbreaking.

550

Yes, I proved the higher the voltage,
the more demons are released.

She has the mental capacity
of a four-year-old,

570
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:11,566
but it is my belief that, with
sufficient electroshock therapy,

571
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:14,466
she can achieve the
intellect of a six-year-old.

Wow.
HOLMES: Who put you up to this?

1071
00:50:41,232 --> 00:50:44,399
Oh, they've been leaving me
notes telling me what to do.

1072

I don't know who it is.

1073

I swear, I'm just a simple wanker.

1074
00:50:48,165 --> 00:50:50,032
He's telling the truth, Watson.

1075
00:50:50,165 --> 00:50:52,533
This morally deficient creature,

1076
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:56,232
this awful, awful excuse
for a man, this...

1077
00:50:56,366 --> 00:50:58,633
Bag of rubbish.
Yes, good one, Watson. Yes.

1078
00:50:58,766 --> 00:51:00,466
Come on, guys. I'm dying.

1079
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,032
These are the wages of wanking, you see?

1080
00:51:03,165 --> 00:51:05,232
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

1081
00:51:05,366 --> 00:51:06,366
Just a...

1082
00:51:06,499 --> 00:51:07,566
Don't wank on us.

1083
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,966
A coal.

1084
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:13,566
Said you were to take it to Newcastle.

1085
00:51:15,366 --> 00:51:17,566
- A lump of coal?
- MUSGRAVE: Yeah.

1086
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,866
To Newcastle?

1087
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,833

1088
00:51:20,966 --> 00:51:23,733

lead us to the real mastermind.

Uh...

1137
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,000
Is there a single logical reason

1138
00:53:05,132 --> 00:53:07,499
for Grace to want to seek your company?

Moriarty escapes to America,

1143

and then these two

Grace is the killer?

1145

Of course she's not the killer.
She's an American.

1146
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,000
She would have used a gun.
Ah. Hmm.

that, just this morning
we discovered a new clue.

is depending on you.

suspect two American women

00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,900
are somehow involved in this plot.

do you think I could have
a picture of us together?

1180
00:55:40,499 --> 00:55:42,566
But who is going to take the photograph?

1181
00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:44,566
Oh, no, I'll take the photograph.

1182
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:47,132

of a self-photograph.

I can take it, and I will be in it also.

with the <i>Titanic.</i>

1761
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:15,766
So, when you think of your friends
and relatives on board the <i>Titanic,</i>

1762
01:21:15,899 --> 01:21:17,399
just remember,

1763
01:21:17,532 --> 01:21:22,066
Dr. John H. Watson put them there.

1765

Bloody good we didn't hang him.

QUEEN VICTORIA: Dr. Watson,

1767
01:21:29,833 --> 01:21:31,466
you saved us.

1768
01:21:31,599 --> 01:21:33,200
Thank you.

1769
01:21:33,332 --> 01:21:35,699
It has been my pleasure
to serve you, Your Majesty.

1770

No, Millie.

1775
01:22:04,232 --> 01:22:06,232
I have a confession to make.

1776
01:22:06,365 --> 01:22:08,899
I'm not actually in love with you.

1777
01:22:09,033 --> 01:22:11,166
In order to conclude my investigation,

1778
01:22:11,299 --> 01:22:14,733
it was imperative that I
understood what love felt like.

1779
01:22:14,866 --> 01:22:17,332
I'm sorry to have led you on.

1780
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:19,033
I have a confession as well.

1781
01:22:19,166 --> 01:22:20,666
I was also not in love.

1782
01:22:20,799 --> 01:22:22,265
I was conducting an experiment

1783
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:25,100
on how easy it is
to manipulate the male ego.

1784
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:28,332
What?
I'm sorry I led you on.

1785
01:22:28,466 --> 01:22:30,733
Well, I have another confession.

1786
01:22:30,866 --> 01:22:33,399
Hmm. I was just pretending
to have a big ego

1787
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:36,200
so as to make you think that
your experiment was working

1788
01:22:36,332 --> 01:22:38,365
so that I could conclude
my experiment on you.

1789
01:22:38,499 --> 01:22:40,265
Well, I had to lead you on

1790
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:42,733
because I was doing an
experiment about how men think

1791
01:22:42,866 --> 01:22:44,865
they can manipulate female scientists
while they're doing experiments.

1792
01:22:44,866 --> 01:22:46,699
Well, I have another confession to make.

that was my first kiss.

Mine as well, and we've
already mastered it.

Yes, indeed.

on the safest ship to sail.

1805

Goodbye.

Farewell, Grace.

Make sure you get plenty of bed rest.

There's a good chance you're pregnant.

From the kissing?

Yes.
Oh, yes.

Really?

No, I'm not just saying it.
