1
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:05,733
Come on.

2
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,637
Come on, come on, come on.

3
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,703
- Brian.
- Hi, Miss Reif.

4
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,671
- Is your mom running late?
- Yeah.

5
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:29,777
Oh! Well, you don't have
to sit out here all alone.

6
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,577
You know, next time she's late,

7
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,981
come see me in your old
classroom, right?

8
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,450
You know, we can start
your homework...

9
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:38,718
go over history lessons, yeah?

10
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,553
Yeah. What's that?

11
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:45,292
Oh, this is a surprise for
my friends that I'm meeting.

12
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,593
Do you want to see it?
- Yeah, sure.

13
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:53,601
Well, that looks good.

14
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:55,668
Hey, put that phone away.

15
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,369
I mean, you still like
reading, don't you?

16
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,976
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Well, I...

17
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:05,644
just finished my first
children's book.

18
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,648
And I want you to be
the first to read it.

19
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,984
"Little Snow was a smart
and a happy little puppy.

20
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:14,452
He had a beautiful coat of fur.

21
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,832
...nice and smart
and happy too."

22
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,268
Hey, Brian.

23
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,538
Do you see that janitor inside?

24
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:32,339
Yeah.

25
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,574
I want you to go up to
her and tell her

26
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:39,013
that she is not to mop the
floors until after you leave.

27
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,416
You could've slipped
and really hurt yourself.

28
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,589
I need you to be a big
man here, you know?

29
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,325
Teach people how to respect you.
Stand up for yourself.

30
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,327
Go on.

31
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,463
Go on. I'll be right here.

32
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,019
- Hi.
- Hey.

33
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,755
What's he doing?

34
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,723
That woman was mopping
right where he was walking.

35
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:28,027
He almost slipped
and really hurt himself.

36
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:30,665
- Oh, God.
- I know.

37
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,633
Well, he's such
a sweet kid, right?

38
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,434
And he's the first to help
his classmates

39
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,505
when they're struggling and
it's just, with kids like him,

40
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:42,775
I really try and get them
to be assertive.

41
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,444
Stand up for themselves.

42
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,946
Especially when it involves
their safety.

43
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:49,982
Right, okay. Thank you.

44
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:51,752
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

45
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,819
I'm sorry, I'm late.

46
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,921
- I'm tired.
- I know, buddy.

47
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,959
Go get your stuff,
we'll go home, okay?

48
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,126
Thank you for keeping
him company.

49
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,764
- No problem.
- You're gonna make a great mom.

50
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,368
Thanks.

51
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,603
Thank you.
Have such a good night.

52
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:11,839
You too.

53
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:17,778
Hey, Brian. Don't play too
many video games, okay?

54
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,680
Okay. Bye.

55
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,582
<i>This is a prepaid call from...</i>

56
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,084

Hello?

00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,279
Hello.

63
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:14,748
Hi.

64
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,250
Hi.

65
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,956
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?

66
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:23,924
Oh, no. I'm good.
Thanks.

67
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,259
Yeah, are you lost?

68
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:30,297
No. I'm just meeting a friend.

69
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,901
Okay. Who's your friend?

70
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,036
Kim.

71
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:39,771
Oh!

72
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,176
I'm sorry. I'm meeting Kim too.

73
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,044
Why?

74
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,948
No, I organized the meeting.
The get-together.

75
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,116
- Oh!
- Yeah.

76
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,318
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

77
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,053
- It's good.
- Yeah, she mentioned to me

78
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,791
that she was... she was inviting
someone else, um...

79
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,693
I'm Emily.

80
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:03,295
- Hey. Leslie.
- Nice to meet you.

81
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:06,365
Nice to meet you. Um, do you
need any help with any of this?

82
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,300
- Oh, sure. Yeah. Um...
- Yeah.

83
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:10,936
Do you want me to carry this?
- No, no, no. I got that.

84
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,371
Um, you can take this.
- Sure.

85
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:14,706
And I'll give you this too.

86
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,041
Thank you.
- Yeah.

87
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:19,378
Um, so, how do you know Kim?

88
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,149
Oh, I work with her down
at the store.

89
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:24,449
Oh, wonderful. Yeah, she...

90
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,919
she said she was looking
for someone to help her out.

91
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,755
- Yeah.
- So, how long have you been in town?

92
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:32,791
Um, about two weeks,
but I used to come through here

93
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,126
all the time on my way
to Jackson Hole.

94
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,861
So it's really familiar.

95
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:36,795
You married?

96
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,798
No.
- What?

97
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,901
Um, well, any guy that wants
to marry me is fucking crazy.

98
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,803
And I don't feel like
dating a crazy man.

99
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,940
So, no.
- Well, do you like

100
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:50,742
the burly type
or the lanky type?

101
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,412
- Um...
- Hm?

102
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:55,981
- I don't know, lanky?
- Oh!

103
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:59,284
Well, I've got seven guys off
the top of my head

104
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,119
who would kill for
a date with you.

105
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,222
No. They're all friends
of my husband's.

106
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:04,790
They're great guys.
- All right.

107
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,158
Well, just let me see
pictures first,

108
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,292
'cause I'm not about
the blind date.

109
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,529
I'm sorry, of course.

110
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:11,763
Remind me after the meeting.
- Okay.

111
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,468
We are upstairs.

112
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:17,972
Wow.

113
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,940
- Leslie!
- Sorry.

114
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,777
Um, so, how do you know Kim?

115
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,180
Oh, I taught her kiddos.

116
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:31,450
- Oh, are you like a teacher?
- You bet.

117
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,854
Oh, so, you must be like
really smart.

118
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:36,021
Yeah.

119
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:41,561
Knock knock.

120
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:43,295
Oh, yay!

121
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:44,863
- How are you?
- There they are.

122
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,798
Look at those pretty girls.

123
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,267
Here, let me take this from you.

124
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,835
- Got it.
- Thank you.

125
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:52,237
We have been snackin'
and waitin' for 25 minutes.

126
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,972
I'm sorry, there was a
straggler at school.

127
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,374
You know how that goes.
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:57,075
Oh my God.
This bitch is hilarious.

129
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,344
- Marjorie.
- And she brought pie.

130
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,514
- I did!
- I've got an insane sweet tooth.

131
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:04,149
You love to outdo yourself.
You're so good.

132
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:07,152
I thought this was, you know,
the perfect thing

133
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,453
for our first meeting.

134
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,857
You know, my way of saying
thank you for coming.

135
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:15,093
Oh, fuck. That looks amazing!
Leslie, we're in a church.

136
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:17,863
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
It just, it looks so good.

137
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,833
Wait, is this for real?

138
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,237
Why? Can no one take
a joke anymore?

139
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,372
Why is everyone so serious
all the time?

140
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,074
Okay.

141
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,310
- Let's dig in.
- This is not meant for decoration.

142
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:33,912
- Let's eat it.
- We should make this a tradition!

143
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:36,817
Pie for the meetings.
- ...as soon as I can, I guess.

144
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,484
Alice, thank you so much
for talking to Father Marcus.

145
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,087
This is perfect.
- Oh, so easy! Don't mention it.

146
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,156
Everybody, this is Leslie.

147
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,491
She has been helping me
and Dylan out at the store.

148
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,293
It's so nice to meet you.

149
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,095
- Nice to meet you.
- Leslie, will you grab me

150
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:51,363
like a little cupcake
or something?

151
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,065
Oh, yeah. Do you need help
sitting down?

152
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,866
- I might.
- You look like you're caring a little...

153
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,168
- Well...
- ...a little extra.

154
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,606
I am. Thank you so much.

155
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,609
- Look at this.
- Isn't that beautiful?

156
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:08,880
Oh, my goodness.
She worked all day and made pie?

157
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,118
- Oh, my goodness.
- Thank you, Alice.

158
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:13,420
Oh, my goodness.

159
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,024
Hm...

160
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,192
Ah!

161
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,262
- So good.
- So good.

162
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:23,995
- Butter.
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,297
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

164
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,065
I mean how can something...

165
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,135
so delicious be so bad for you?

166
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:41,581
I am really, really happy
that we are finally doing this.

167
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,515
Yes.

168
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:45,352
Um, today I just want us to...

169
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,353
introduce ourselves, you know,
get to know each other.

170
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:49,622
There's...

171
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:53,460
There's no agenda
that needs to be accomplished.

172
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:59,665
We are here to support
each other

173
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:02,000
through this
multicultural warfare.

174
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,168
- That's right.
- Mm-hmm.

175
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,072
Now, I... I have been
brainwashed

176
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,275
to feel ashamed of my heritage.

177
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:14,946
To feel...
guilt for the prosperity

178
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:19,317
that our husbands, our fathers,
our brothers,

179
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,521
created in the Western world

180
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:25,223
and that everyone else
benefitted from.

181
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,529
We're all brainwashed.
All of us.

182
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:34,435
Um... I'm a teacher down
at the school and...

183
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,538
Um...

184
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:41,208
I, um...

185
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:45,245
I really want to be a mom.

186
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,481
And, um...

187
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:52,184
getting pregnant is taking
a little bit longer

188
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:54,321
than we expected, so...

189
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:01,460
maybe God is giving me a
higher purpose, right?

190
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:02,662
- That's right.
- Right.

191
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:05,499
This club.

192
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,535
Yeah.

193
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:09,502
Well, I like the name.

194
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:12,239
It has a sense of moving
through generations.

195
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:14,707
Yeah. Um...

196
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:18,276
Well, do we want to go around
and introduce ourselves?

197
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,146
Sort of, I don't know,
throw out ideas

198
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,116
for what we might
want this to be.

199
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:26,220
Um...

200
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,422
- I...
- Caught you off guard.

201
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,192
I'm Marjorie, um...

202
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,627
I'm actually not sure
I belong here.

203
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,228
I'm sorry, I don't want
to make you mad.

204
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,264
Just...
- No. You can never make me mad, Marjorie.

205
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,733
No, I mean that.

206
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:43,335
No, this doesn't have
to be anything

207
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:45,573
other than what you
want it to be.

208
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:49,074
I mean, is there a
particular reason

209
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,276
why you did come today?

210
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,647
Oh, I just wanted advice
with a work thing.

211
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:58,784
Um? Well, do you want to
explain what happened

212
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:00,555
and we can talk it out?

213
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:04,524
Um... yeah.

214
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:08,161
Okay, so...
I work in town, um...

215
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:12,063
Well, first off I want
to say I don't hate her.

216
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,500
I don't hate anyone, um...

217
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:15,768
But, yeah, I work in town

218
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,539
and I take the bus
an hour each way

219
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,509
and I have been busting
my ass for two years

220
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:28,683
and... so that I could
get manager pay.

221
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,352
And it's not her fault,
but um...

222
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:35,153
but this Colombian girl,

223
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,657
she started around
the same time as me.

224
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:39,459
Me a little bit before her,
well...

225
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,327
so she got promoted
and I didn't.

226
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,830
- Of course.
- That's not fair.

227
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:46,398
That's how I felt.

228
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,601
So did the Colombian
woman stick up for you

229
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:50,570
and say, "Hey, she was hired
before I was?"

230
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:52,237
Nope.

231
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,808
No, so, I...

232
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,107
Quick question.

233
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,745
Nobody's gonna post
about this, right?

234
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:02,447
Oh, Marjorie. Our constitution
was designed to protect you.

235
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,115
- Yeah.
- Right?

236
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:05,620
You have feelings.

237
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:07,687
Those feelings,
they're not wrong.

238
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,289
Right. Hmm...

239
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:13,793
Right. So, anyway, I decided
to stand up for myself...

240
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:16,394
- Good.
- And I asked my manager

241
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,764
why she got promoted
and I didn't.

242
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:21,534
And he said it was because
she has better

243
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:24,537
leadership skills than I do.

244
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,272
Um... I don't know
what happened,

245
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,910
but I just kinda snapped,
you know?

246
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:32,814
Mm-hmm.

247
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,882
- It's 'cause she's brown.
- Thank you!

248
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:38,751
And nobody would stand up
for me.

249
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:40,753
You know, my co-workers
didn't have my back

250
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:43,321
and I... I just felt crazy.

251
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:44,790
No. No, you're not
crazy.

252
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,224
You're not crazy.
- Yeah.

253
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,794
No, it's just like diversity.
Inclusion.

254
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:50,495
It's like they're speaking
in fucking code.

255
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:53,431
You know what I mean? It's on
every fucking form, you know.

256
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,804
Every government form,
every employment form.

257
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:59,874
Every fucking receipt.
You know what I mean? And...

258
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,708
Yeah, so I just, I don't
know what to do and I...

259
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,445
I guess that's why I'm here.

260
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,280
Hey.

261
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:08,881
Thank you for sharing.

262
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:11,151
And for speaking
up for yourself.

263
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,555
I'd like to also add, you know,

264
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:19,391
Mexicans and Blacks can get away
with saying things like,

265
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:21,627
you know, "White people
are so awful."

266
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:22,728
All the time.
- Yes!

267
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,864
Or "White..."
This is my favourite.

268
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:29,334
"White people are the worst."
And no one says anything.

269
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,905
But the minute we offer up
any sort of critique...

270
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:35,741
Ouh! People shout, "racist."

271
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:37,242
Yep.

272
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:40,278
Marjorie just know
you are in good company, okay?

273
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,548
We all kind of feel how you feel

274
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,820
and anything you gotta say,
you're safe to get it out here.

275
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:48,756
You know, it's like...

276
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,223
the Asians come over,
they take over companies...

277
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,629
get us sick, I don't say
anything, you know?

278
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:56,461
And then...

279
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:58,898
urban kids, right? They can't
even spell their name

280
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,633
and they get into better
colleges than me.

281
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:02,868
And it's like okay still, fine.
I don't say anything.

282
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,438
- Mm-hmm.
- Now every brown bitch gets special treatment

283
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,674
because they've convinced people
to feel sorry for her

284
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:10,343
and it's like...
I...

285
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:12,410
then I'm the racist?

286
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:15,514
It's like, there's nothing left
for me in this country.

287
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:18,851
Yeah, I'm a good person.
I work hard.

288
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,954
But I refuse to grow old
this poor

289
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:24,690
and have people tell me
that I've got it good!

290
00:20:24,692 --> 00:20:26,792
I don't.
I'm struggling.

291
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:28,830
I work paycheque to paycheque.

292
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,500
Oh, boy.

293
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:04,063
Oh, it is wonderful to see
young people in the movement.

294
00:21:04,065 --> 00:21:05,631
I can't believe
you're not married.

295
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,533
Oh, well, don't worry
about that.

296
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:09,668
We're gonna help with that.
Leslie is in the same boat.

297
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,737
I know plenty of
great single men

298
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:12,671
who'd just eat you up.

299
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:14,372
Well, it's slim pickings for me,

300
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,809
but I got a couple if you
don't mind older.

301
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:20,045
Actually, I only
date older men so...

302
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:21,881
Hey! Listen up.

303
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:23,816
How about we all
come to the meeting

304
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:26,519
with a list of, like,
10 great guys.

305
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:29,056
Yes, great. Great.
- Yep. Alice.

306
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:33,692
Hi. I'm Alice up
on Owen Street.

307
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:35,362
And, um...

308
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:38,498
I'm tired.

309
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:43,604
I spend a lot of my time alone.
In my own thoughts.

310
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:46,541
We're really not supposed
to live like that.

311
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,710
So... I hope that we
can keep growing

312
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:53,815
and keep bringing new people in

313
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:57,516
because just being here with
you all,

314
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:59,554
hearing your inspiring
ideas, Em...

315
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:01,687
I already feel more like myself.

316
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:03,122
Oh, me too, hon.

317
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:06,525
It is so hard being
a mom. You can be so isolated.

318
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:07,860
I mean, that's why
we need to recruit.

319
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:09,728
Yeah, we gotta keep growing.

320
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,363
You don't have to be
going through this alone.

321
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,600
Maybe talk to your friends.

322
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:16,702
Start building a little
bit more community.

323
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:18,436
Help them pick up groceries.

324
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:22,074
Have them help you pick up kiddos and...
- Yeah.

325
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:25,878
You know, you can really
introduce concepts anywhere.

326
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,847
- And of course...
- At yoga class.

327
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:28,848
Yeah!

328
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,448
Right. That's perfect.

329
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,719
I mean, they're the ones
who started Black Lives Matter.

330
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:36,088
They're the ones who are
creating this divide.

331
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,793
They lit a fuse and then let
their kids run wild with it.

332
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:41,392
Emily's life matters.
So does mine.

333
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,662
All lives matter.

334
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:44,732
Yes.

335
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:47,666
We have better doctors.

336
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,068
We live longer.

337
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,505
We take better care
of each other.

338
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:53,541
These are facts.

339
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:56,842
Does acknowledging facts
make me a bad person?

340
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:59,678
No. Jeez, no.
- Oh, my goodness, no.

341
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,915
Come here.

342
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,115
Come here.

343
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:06,585
- Thank you. Hi.
- I'm Jessica.

344
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:13,458
Well, I wasn't sure
what to expect

345
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,764
but Miss Emily was
real persistent.

346
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:20,799
Um... okay, okay.

347
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:25,436
My daddy was
the chapter President

348
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:28,507
of the KKK in Valentine,
Nebraska,

349
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:31,476
and I have been
a member my whole life.

350
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:37,049
I'm more active in Storm front
since our lives are online.

351
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:40,485
And I don't normally
tell people that

352
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,888
because I know what people
think about us

353
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,524
and, you know, the media
loves to portray us

354
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:47,893
as these like big scary
monsters.

355
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:51,797
But am I really that scary?

356
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,699
I'm a mother of four,

357
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:57,202
pregnant with number five right
here, and...

358
00:23:57,204 --> 00:24:01,106
this club just really
appeals to me,

359
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:04,209
because, well, it's like I
always say, it starts with

360
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:06,946
the mommas and what they're
teaching their babies.

361
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:08,881
God bless you.
Thank God.

362
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:11,050
And I'm not here
to cause a fuss.

363
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:13,018
I'm not here to say,
"Oh, you know, lynch 'em all,"

364
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,653
you know, like people
might think.

365
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:15,955
No, I'm just...

366
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:18,659
I'm just here to talk
common sense.

367
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:21,727
- Multiculturalism doesn't work.
- That's right.

368
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:23,796
It's never worked,
it's not going to work.

369
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:26,000
They sure as hell
don't like us, and...

370
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:29,168
- the feeling's mutual.
- Exactly.

371
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,136
- So...
- I got two kids.

372
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,204
You're a momma too?

373
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:33,605
- Yeah.
- Oh!

374
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:35,074
Here, I'll pass
this to you then.

375
00:24:35,076 --> 00:24:38,844
I wanted to have more, but,
you know, they are expensive.

376
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:40,579
So, you know, you try
to get loans,

377
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:42,581
but, you try getting a loan
from the Jew banks.

378
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:45,551
They love saying no.
They love it.

379
00:24:45,553 --> 00:24:47,853
I mean, I cannot laugh.

380
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:48,954
It's true, though.

381
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:51,290
I mean, I don't know
when it happened,

382
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:54,593
but we founded this country
in 1776, right?

383
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:55,694
That's right.

384
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:57,663
And now we're watching
it being taken

385
00:24:57,665 --> 00:24:59,698
from under our noses
in plain sight.

386
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,002
Mm-hmm.

387
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:04,269
Dylan, you know,
he runs our store

388
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:06,672
and we can barely stay afloat.
You see it.

389
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:09,541
I mean, it's because all the
illegal immigrants, they steal.

390
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:11,178
Yes, they do.

391
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:14,213
And... oh, God!

392
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:17,216
It's just the whining
and the disrespect you get

393
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:18,851
from these coloured kids
who come into the store.

394
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:20,886
They just come and barge in,

395
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:22,721
and they're so freaking loud.

396
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:25,657
They're... what is the point
of being so loud?

397
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:28,027
And they're doing it
just to make sure

398
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:29,730
you can't think straight.

399
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:37,304
I think an ethnic state
is the most successful state.

400
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:39,738
I think that's how
you ensure unity.

401
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,207
I think that's how you
regulate the markets.

402
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,277
Mm-hmm.

403
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:45,944
I've got a journalism degree.

404
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:48,047
Hm?

405
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:50,115
That's nice.
- And I was thinking about,

406
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:52,117
you know, using it to help out
our group.

407
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,019
And first thing you got to do,
obviously,

408
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:56,255
is take the media
back from the Jews.

409
00:25:56,257 --> 00:25:58,891
- Mm-hmm.
- But Emily and I were thinking

410
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:03,729
about starting a newsletter or a
magazine that contains some of our ideas.

411
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:05,230
And if we can get 'em
on the shelves,

412
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:07,299
we can start reaching people.

413
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,667
- Yeah.
- Right.

414
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:11,303
I didn't meet you.
I'm Kim, by the way.

415
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:13,072
Hi, Kim.

416
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:14,840
Good to meet you.

417
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:16,108
Leslie.

418
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,079
Oh, me? Sorry.

419
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:20,646
I'm Leslie.

420
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:21,982
And...

421
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:26,185
I'm sorry, what am I supposed
to say?

422
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:27,252
Tell whatever you want.

423
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,021
Whatever you want.
Why you're here.

424
00:26:29,023 --> 00:26:30,989
Yes, there are no wrong
answers, Leslie.

425
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:32,660
I mean that. Okay?
- Okay.

426
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:37,865
Well, I'm here because, well,
Kim invited me, honestly.

427
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:39,667
And...

428
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,369
you know, I've been
lucky that I've...

429
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,304
I've been very lucky with
the friendships that I've made.

430
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:47,608
I guess it's karma
for my shitty family.

431
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:49,743
But, um...

432
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:53,278
when I was in prison, I got
close with a group of people

433
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,782
that really got
my head straight.

434
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,952
And I really miss that way
of life, you know,

435
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:01,353
being told what to do,
where to go,

436
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:04,225
it just makes sense for me.

437
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:06,393
So...

438
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:09,828
a friend of mine knew that
I needed that out here,

439
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,930
so she introduced me to Kim.
- Mm-hmm.

440
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:14,768
And that's what she is to me,
you know, my stability.

441
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:19,271
And, I love her kids
like they were my own.

442
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:22,141
They love her.
- I would kill for those babies.

443
00:27:22,143 --> 00:27:23,177
And...

444
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:26,981
you know, I want to have
a family like that one day.

445
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:30,117
Yeah, I mean, they just...

446
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:31,952
They took me in.

447
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:34,755
No questions asked, so...
- No, no.

448
00:27:36,257 --> 00:27:38,157
- I'm just here to help.
- Aw!

449
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,793
You know, in any way that I can.

450
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:42,761
Aw! Thank you
for sharing, Leslie.

451
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:44,732
- Yeah.
- For being here.

452
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:46,834
Um...

453
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:50,035
I would also like to add this.

454
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:53,340
- Really important.
- Yes. Yeah.

455
00:27:53,874 --> 00:28:00,247
You know, these... these libs say that
they're fighting for women's rights, right?

456
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:03,182
They're just trying
to make us masculine.

457
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:06,921
Well, think about it.

458
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:11,091
Who would a guy rather be with?
Hm?

459
00:28:12,293 --> 00:28:14,695
Marjorie?

460
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:16,762
Leslie?

461
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:21,900
Or some, I don't...
blubbering brown whale

462
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:24,803
coming in from God knows
what country,

463
00:28:24,805 --> 00:28:27,206
with what type of disgusting
disease.

464
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,909
Ew!

465
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:35,382
For our men's strength
and resources...

466
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:41,088
they get this.

467
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:44,358
- Ephesians 5.
- Yes. Yes.

468
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:50,128
Now this, this is the only
gender balance

469
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,765
that has proven to build
strong families.

470
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:55,336
Yeah.

471
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:59,171
And we need strong families.

472
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:00,439
Aw, honey.

473
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:04,776
You know, it goes
back to the 1960s

474
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:06,914
with the, you know, the...

475
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:10,518
the decay of the traditional
family which had this...

476
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:13,187
Hm.

477
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,423
- It really messed us up.
- It did.

478
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:21,493
You are such a resource.

479
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:23,862
Beauty and brains.
Look at that.

480
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:26,198
I just want to take
a minute here

481
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,134
to acknowledge all the work
you did in organizing this

482
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:31,470
and getting all of our butts
into one room.

483
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:33,805
Making pie.

484
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:36,441
Listen, you're really making
a difference, okay?

485
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,010
For me anyway.
- Thank you, Kim.

486
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:39,911
- Yeah.
- And you make really great pie.

487
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:42,848
I'm gonna take notes

488
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,882
and I'll email everyone
afterwards.

489
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:45,083
No. I don't...

490
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:47,288
Maybe we shouldn't have
a trail like that.

491
00:29:47,555 --> 00:29:51,392
I'm sorry. What have we done
that's wrong?

492
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:54,527
No, name one thing
that we've said here

493
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:56,828
or done here today
that's illegal. Tell me.

494
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,363
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- No. Tell me.

495
00:29:58,365 --> 00:30:00,365
- Um, I...
- No. I'm sorry.

496
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,403
I just, I'm more...
- Emily.

497
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:05,404
Maybe we can talk about
the newsletter.

498
00:30:05,406 --> 00:30:09,609
Um, I would really appreciate,
I don't know about you guys,

499
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:13,211
but I need home schooling
materials immediately.

500
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:15,548
Because you should hear what
they are teaching my children.

501
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,383
Oh, I can only imagine.
I can only imagine.

502
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:21,219
I will help you with curriculum.
It's...

503
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:23,257
it's actually always been a...

504
00:30:23,957 --> 00:30:26,958
a dream of mine to write
a children's book.

505
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,193
- Aw!
- Really?

506
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:31,098
You know you should, um...

507
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,134
You should just make
your own school.

508
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:38,604
You know, like, really,
really like dream big.

509
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:40,138
- Yes!
- Put it all out there.

510
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,644
Yes! That is a great idea,
Leslie. Thank you.

511
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:45,611
Yeah.

512
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:48,514
Um, I...

513
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:51,049
I've actually already
started on the book.

514
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:52,417
What?
- Yeah.

515
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:55,187
Just, you know, after school.
Sort of sketching, um...

516
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:56,556
- Oh, my gosh.
- Let me see.

517
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:58,290
- It's really rough, but...
- Oh my God.

518
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:00,192
These are amazing, Emily.
- He's a cute dog.

519
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:02,427
Aw!

520
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:04,329
How did you learn how
to draw like this?

521
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:05,533
My brother.

522
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:08,268
He's the real talent.

523
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,336
How creative you both are.

524
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,337
All right.

525
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:14,339
The magazine.
- Yes!

526
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:17,175
Should we, like, make a list

527
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:19,344
of all the illegal immigrants
around the area?

528
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:21,681
So everybody knows where
they live and stuff.

529
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:24,182
Um, no, no!
Hold on.

530
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:29,121
That's the idea and, you know,
everything thus far

531
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:30,956
has been a step in the right
direction in the magazine,

532
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:34,025
but we want to be careful with
this first issue, right?

533
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:37,028
We want to engage
the mainstream, right?

534
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,534
We can't come on
too strong, okay?

535
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:43,402
Soft on the outside

536
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:48,206
so vigorous ideas
can be digested more easily.

537
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,474
Hm.

538
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:53,613
Now we are the best
secret weapon that no one

539
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:59,017
checks at the door
because we tread quietly.

540
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,354
Hm.

541
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:03,656
I don't know where this fits
into everything,

542
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:05,290
but I think it's important
to scold

543
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:07,695
the spic and African parents
in front of their kids.

544
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:10,495
That way the child will
see the parent

545
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:12,364
as the root cause for
their embarrassment

546
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:14,299
and naturally distance
themselves

547
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:16,538
and their similarities as they
assimilate more quickly.

548
00:32:16,905 --> 00:32:19,337
I'm sorry.

549
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:22,575
Wow, Alice...

550
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:24,546
Oh my God.

551
00:32:24,846 --> 00:32:26,445
- Alice.
- It's on me.

552
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:28,079
It's all down my back.
- I'm so sorry.

553
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,181
Emily.

554
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:30,616
I'm so, I'm so sorry.

555
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:32,585
No, I'm sure it's my
fault in some way.

556
00:32:32,587 --> 00:32:34,286
- Jeez.
- I got it.

557
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:35,688
Oh, my gosh.

558
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:42,963
- Father, thank you...
- Please go.

559
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,130
- I'm sorry, we...
- Please.

560
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:46,500
I don't want any trouble.

561
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:52,170
- I don't understand, what...
- Please, just... I mean it.

562
00:32:52,172 --> 00:32:55,106
Just go right now
and I won't report you.

563
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:56,611
But right now.

564
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,096
Good. I'm glad I didn't
ruin the sofa too.

565
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:20,265
Ladies! Ladies.

566
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:23,068
What?
- Should be we go back to my place for some wine?

567
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,605
Yeah! I would love
to, but I can't. Kiddos.

568
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:27,405
- Ow!
- Next time.

569
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:29,675
- Next time.
- Yeah, I'm sorry. Lars and I have a date night.

570
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:31,243
- Ow!
- We'll do it again.

571
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:33,078
- I mean, I'm game.
- You sound like an ape

572
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,446
when you speak like that.

573
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:35,681
Oh, God, yeah.

574
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:36,782
I guess you're right.

575
00:33:36,784 --> 00:33:38,718
Well, I'll help you work
on that.

576
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,054
I wish I could.
Really do, but duty calls.

577
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:44,422
Do we need to clean up?

578
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:46,592
Oh, God!
No, leave it.

579
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:48,426
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes!

580
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:51,766
They have staff. Um, Leslie,
my dear, are you gonna join us?

581
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:53,431
- Yeah.
- Oh, great!

582
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:54,301
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

583
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:57,503
We should get the guys
together sometime soon, yes?

584
00:33:57,505 --> 00:33:59,404
Find me one first, would you?

585
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:02,107
I have always loved
James for you.

586
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:05,277
Wait, wait, the guy that works
at the gasoline store?

587
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,380
- Yes. Yeah, that's the redhead.
- God. Horrible hands.

588
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:10,482
- Marjorie!
- Do you think I would like him?

589
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:13,786
- Beggars can't be choosers.
- I mean, if you like short and fat fingers.

590
00:34:13,788 --> 00:34:15,387
Yes, I think you'd really
like him.

591
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,289
Sometimes I do.

592
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,291
Okay. Well, then James
is your guy.

593
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:20,693
No, Leslie.
Don't listen to her.

594
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:22,260
James would be great for you.

595
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:23,696
- He's sweet.
- He deserves a good girl.

596
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:25,263
I get it, I get it.

597
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:27,432
I just want to see
pictures first.

598
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:29,702
Yeah. It's always weird when
you show up

599
00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:33,506
and they're kind of like
fucking ew looking.

600
00:34:33,508 --> 00:34:35,808
Trust me.
- Yeah. Or then when they smile

601
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,243
and you see their teeth.
- Oh my God.

602
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:40,880
Oh my God!
I know exactly what you mean.

603
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:42,582
I've walked out because
it's like, ugh!

604
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:45,483
Here. Do you want some?
- Yeah. Thanks.

605
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:48,521
- Always pack some extras.
- Oh!

606
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:52,727
- Yeah?
- It really gets you down to the bones.

607
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:56,261
- Ah!
- Look at that moon.

608
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:59,497
That was the first time
I've been in a church in...

609
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:01,132
I think since I was like seven.

610
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:03,502
Well, I'm surprised
I didn't burn up

611
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:04,837
and go straight to hell. So...

612
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:06,338
God.

613
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,473
I feel the same way actually.

614
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:12,143
Yeah.
- God has maybe forgiven us.

615
00:35:12,145 --> 00:35:13,813
I don't know.

616
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:16,414
I mean, he should after
going through that.

617
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:19,317
Thank you. Ladies, I'll email
you all with the notes later.

618
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:21,252
So nice to meet you both.
- Jess, safe home.

619
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:24,157
Have a wonderful night, ladies.

620
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,660
Jess!

621
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:29,664
You're so bad.

622
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:35,202
Oh!

623
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:40,238
Um, thanks for inviting me.
It actually was kind of cool.

624
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,374
Well, it was either this
or kill myself.

625
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:45,343
Kim, are you going to the store?
- Yeah, for a minute. Why?

626
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:48,681
- We need some more wine.
- Yeah. Always more wine.

627
00:35:48,683 --> 00:35:50,415
Can we get a ride
with you real quick?

628
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:52,618
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Do you guys mind a quick detour? I'm sorry.

629
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,756
- Not at all!
- Shotgun!

630
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:56,555
Damn it!

631
00:35:56,557 --> 00:35:58,593
I was just going for it!

632
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:00,926
Okay...

633
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:02,494
Hey!

634
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:04,530
Oh, no. Yeah.

635
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:05,931
No, it went great.

636
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:08,901
Yes, yes, yes, but, Kimmy
is actually giving me a ride

637
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:10,368
to the store to pick
up some things.

638
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,737
So can you pick me up there?

639
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:15,208
Great. Oh, um... Yeah.

640
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,409
And actually some of the girls

641
00:36:17,411 --> 00:36:18,711
are gonna come over
for some wine.

642
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:21,716
Is that okay?
Yeah, well, I don't know.

643
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:23,885
Yeah. Yeah.

644
00:36:24,752 --> 00:36:27,285
Okay. All right.

645
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:29,822
Yeah. I love you too, babe.

646
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,356
Bye. See you soon.

647
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,291
See you soon.
- Craig... Hey!

648
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:36,796
Craig is excited to meet
my new friends.

649
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:39,330
- Oh, he's a sweetheart.
- He is.

650
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:43,334
Thank you for coming
on into the mom van.

651
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:45,838
Sorry it's so messy.
I didn't expect company.

652
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,907
Also, sorry about the smell.

653
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:51,711
It's pretty much our family's
locker room.

654
00:36:51,713 --> 00:36:53,979
So, that's why it smells
like feet, I guess.

655
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:56,615
I'm used to this smell.

656
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:59,018
The backroom at the store
smells like it too.

657
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,854
It's really Dylan. She says
it's the kids, it's not.

658
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:04,489
Oh, no!

659
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:07,026
Throw him under the bus.
- You're funny.

660
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:08,596
Thanks.

661
00:37:09,831 --> 00:37:11,564
So, how long have
you been teaching?

662
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:14,600
- About five years now.
- Wow, that's a long time.

663
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:16,569
- Yeah.
- What grades do you do?

664
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:18,771
I do kindergarten.
Yeah, really early.

665
00:37:18,773 --> 00:37:20,639
- That's so cute.
- I know!

666
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,675
- They're so, so little.
- They're so little.

667
00:37:22,677 --> 00:37:25,878
They're so sweet! Ah!
I love it.

668
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,280
That's awesome.

669
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:29,380
What age do you
teach? Sorry.

670
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:32,051
Kindergarten. Yeah,
so like five or six

671
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:33,552
depending on, you know...
- Yeah, yeah.

672
00:37:33,554 --> 00:37:35,623
...their birth date. Yeah.

673
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:37,525
Hey, you know...

674
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:39,992
I actually have all of
these vintage clothes

675
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:43,629
that I've been wanting to sell
and make an online store.

676
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:45,499
- Oh?
- And...

677
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,634
I don't know, like,
I was thinking maybe

678
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:50,972
we could put the money
for it towards...

679
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,439
the school or the magazine,
or something like that.

680
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:55,841
- Oh.
- That's a really good idea.

681
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:57,643
- You know, towards the cause.
- You would do that?

682
00:37:57,645 --> 00:37:59,477
- Yeah.
- I mean, I can contribute stuff too.

683
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:01,547
I've got a lot of stuff
lying around.

684
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:03,414
That would be awesome.
- Yeah.

685
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:06,353
Yeah. And I mean, I still need
to take pictures to post them, but...

686
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:08,022
I mean, I don't know, maybe...

687
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:10,823
maybe you'd want to.
I mean, you're so pretty.

688
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:12,457
You're basically like a model.
- What?

689
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,627
What? No.
- Yes!

690
00:38:14,629 --> 00:38:16,361
- You're being silly!
- Emily, you have literally

691
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:18,097
the best genes
of anybody I know.

692
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:19,932
Just fishing for compliments!

693
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:22,668
- Kim. No.
- You don't look like that.

694
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,336
- I am not!
- You're like Barbie made real.

695
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:27,540
Yeah!

696
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:30,042
I should just take you guys
around with me all the time.

697
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:32,580
But seriously,

698
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:34,947
we all have great genes, right?

699
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,015
Yes, we do.

700
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:37,550
Marjorie, I...

701
00:38:37,552 --> 00:38:38,951
I don't mean to be staring
at your tits,

702
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:40,719
- but you have great tits.
- It's true.

703
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:44,023
And I'm not a dyke.

704
00:38:44,025 --> 00:38:46,025
Small but mighty I always say.

705
00:38:46,027 --> 00:38:48,794
So will you do it?
Will you model the clothes?

706
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:50,497
Yeah. Yeah.

707
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:52,900
Gosh, I just...

708
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:56,003
Ah, I want my own school!

709
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:58,971
You'd be perfect.
You really would.

710
00:38:58,973 --> 00:39:01,040
- I don't know, ladies.
- If there's anybody who could do it...

711
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,440
And you know what?

712
00:39:02,442 --> 00:39:04,677
If niggers can have
their own colleges

713
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,512
and Jews can have their
own community centres

714
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:08,113
and Islam can have its own laws,

715
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:09,982
we can have our own goddamn
elementary school, yeah?

716
00:39:09,984 --> 00:39:11,819
- Yeah.
- Amen.

717
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:16,655
Um, Leslie, do you have
a type of wine you prefer?

718
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:19,525
Um... I don't really.

719
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:20,826
Okay.

720
00:39:20,828 --> 00:39:24,096
- Red, white, rosé.
- Oh, rosé.

721
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,102
I'll be in.

722
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:31,706
Okay.

723
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:34,508
Did you do the...

724
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:39,712
I called him, he's
coming on Tuesday at 3 o'clock.

725
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:40,915
Okay.

726
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,786
I'll ring you up.

727
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:22,688
Thank you, Kim.

728
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,523
- Oh, hey!
- I can do it myself.

729
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,025
- They're closed.
- Excuse me.

730
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:28,629
- They're closed.
- We're closed.

731
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:30,996
Really? We're just gonna
be real quick.

732
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:32,564
We're just getting
a bottle of wine.

733
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:34,066
I don't care how quick
you're gonna be.

734
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:35,868
We're closed.
- You're checking her out.

735
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,636
Yeah, but I work here.

736
00:40:37,638 --> 00:40:39,838
I'm sorry. Do you speak English

737
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,173
or do we need to speak
slower for you?

738
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:43,108
What?

739
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,476
Look, I had a long
day at work too.

740
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:46,879
I understand.
Let's just...

741
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:48,479
Can I just get a quick
bottle of wine?

742
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:50,683
- I'll get the most expensive one.
- This is my store

743
00:40:50,685 --> 00:40:53,752
and I can refuse service
to anyone.

744
00:40:53,754 --> 00:40:55,688
I understand that...

745
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,690
but legally you need
to have a better reason

746
00:40:57,692 --> 00:40:59,158
than being an old, tired cunt.

747
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,926
- Lily, stop.
- Excuse me?

748
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,563
What? Did...? What?
Are you fucking serious?

749
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:05,998
Let's go.

750
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,167
You just walk into
our store saying that shit?

751
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:09,601
- Come on.
- Let's go.

752
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:10,936
You always just take it.
Stand up for yourself.

753
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:12,673
That's his sister.

754
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,911
Let's go.

755
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:18,980
No.

756
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:21,882
Buy your wine.

757
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,623
You said you're going to buy...

758
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,960
the most expensive
bottle of wine.

759
00:41:34,061 --> 00:41:36,595
I mean...

760
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:38,897
isn't that what
she said to you, Kim?

761
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:40,933
- Uh, yes.
- Yeah.

762
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:42,503
That's what I heard.

763
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:45,938
You don't need to get it.
Come on, let's go.

764
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,208
It's all right.
I got it.

765
00:42:08,596 --> 00:42:10,229
That's $300.

766
00:42:10,231 --> 00:42:12,664
Well, that's a really good deal.

767
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:15,202
That's fucking ridiculous,
Anne. Come on, let's go.

768
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:32,153
Hold on.
Hold on, hold on.

769
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:38,659
Okay.

770
00:42:39,593 --> 00:42:40,928
We're good.

771
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:43,030
Thanks.

772
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:47,966
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

773
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:51,136
The only people who carry
$300 in cash

774
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:53,338
are either whores or thieves.

775
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,142
Or waitresses.

776
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,145
Sorry, wait a second.

777
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:01,715
What even are you?

778
00:43:02,016 --> 00:43:04,983
Yeah. Kinda looks like
a chink fucked a wetback.

779
00:43:13,027 --> 00:43:15,229
Whatever you think I am
is how you're gonna treat me.

780
00:43:15,629 --> 00:43:17,631
So I guess that's what I am.

781
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:20,101
- Just let us go.
- Hey!

782
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:24,036
Say thank you, faggots.

783
00:43:24,038 --> 00:43:26,772
We're sisters.
You fucking idiot.

784
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:28,807
What the fuck did
you just call me?

785
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:31,777
- Don't fucking touch her!
- Get off of me.

786
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:33,645
Get off of me!

787
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:35,714
- Get off!
- Get off of me!

788
00:43:38,052 --> 00:43:39,985
Let go of her fucking purse,
you fucking animal.

789
00:43:39,987 --> 00:43:42,421
Get the fuck out.
- Get the fuck out!

790
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:44,258
- Come, let's go.
- Get out!

791
00:43:45,126 --> 00:43:46,861
The fuck!

792
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:48,360
- Fuck you!
- Emily Reif,

793
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:50,095
you know what they do to rapists

794
00:43:50,097 --> 00:43:51,430
like your brother in prison?

795
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:53,398
He's never gonna be able
to take a solid shit again.

796
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,900
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

797
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:56,768
Holy fucking shit!
Are you fucking kidding me?

798
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,871
No. She's a fucking slut!

799
00:43:58,873 --> 00:44:00,739
She's a fucking liar.

800
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:02,341
Hey. Hey! Hey!
- She's a liar.

801
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:03,876
What's going on, Kim?

802
00:44:03,878 --> 00:44:05,711
Disrespectful.

803
00:44:05,713 --> 00:44:07,446
That was so fucking disrespectful.
- You're okay?

804
00:44:07,448 --> 00:44:09,448
The fuck!
- What's going on?

805
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,250
Your brother would
never touch that girl.

806
00:44:11,252 --> 00:44:12,818
- What's going on?
- Much less rape her.

807
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,686
- What's going on?
- She was threatening me.

808
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:17,823
- Who was threatening you?
- The bitch who put Jeff in jail.

809
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:19,391
She was just in here.
She just walked in here.

810
00:44:19,393 --> 00:44:20,726
I didn't know what she wanted.

811
00:44:20,728 --> 00:44:21,960
She walked in here
with somebody else.

812
00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:23,462
And I didn't recognize
her at first. But...

813
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:25,030
I got it. I got it.

814
00:44:25,032 --> 00:44:26,765
Hey, we had a long week, okay?

815
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:28,033
Let's go get some
wine and go home.

816
00:44:28,035 --> 00:44:29,334
- Wait...
- Okay?

817
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,970
Craig, Craig, you should
freaking see all of 'em.

818
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:34,039
They hang outside of Clark's
and they just...

819
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:35,440
they are so loud
and like animals.

820
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:37,209
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Drinking all this...

821
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:39,144
- So you know these guys?
- No, I don't know 'em.

822
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:40,812
But she went to school
with Anne.

823
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:42,781
I... I didn't know
the other one.

824
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:44,082
Hold on, hold on!

825
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:45,784
It's okay.
It's okay.

826
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:49,087
That bitch needs to shut her
carpet munching fucking face.

827
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:51,089
Okay? You know where she lives?

828
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:53,058
- I... yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah?

829
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,726
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

830
00:44:54,728 --> 00:44:56,128
Let's go. Come on.

831
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,930
All we'll do is take
a shit in her tub

832
00:44:57,932 --> 00:44:59,898
or like, steal her fucking
passport or something.

833
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,500
- Hey. Hey.
- She'll never know that it's us.

834
00:45:01,502 --> 00:45:03,202
- Come on, now.
- No.

835
00:45:03,204 --> 00:45:04,937
She cannot talk
to her like that.

836
00:45:04,939 --> 00:45:06,738
- She can't use that disrespect.
- Sweetheart, let's go home.

837
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,340
- We shouldn't.
- No. We should.

838
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:09,877
What do you mean, you shouldn't?

839
00:45:12,846 --> 00:45:13,648
I can go alone,
if everyone wants, okay?

840
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:16,348
I can just do it myself.

841
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,883
But she cannot be talking
to you like that.

842
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:19,418
No. You know what,
I'm fucking game.

843
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,953
I'm sorry, I'm in.

844
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:24,122
I'm in.
- Emily.

845
00:45:24,124 --> 00:45:26,325
- It'll be fun.
- Teach the bitch a lesson.

846
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:28,493
- I'll do it if you do it.
- Yeah. Fuck that shit.

847
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:30,929
- Just for a minute.
- Okay. Yes, yes, yes.

848
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:32,164
I'll go.
- Yes!

849
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,966
- I'll go. I'll go. I'll go.
- What are you...

850
00:45:33,968 --> 00:45:36,068
- This is just like high school!
- Let's go get supplies.

851
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,203
Oh, man, we're riding again.

852
00:45:40,808 --> 00:45:42,176
What?

853
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,979
What?

854
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:47,181
I didn't say anything.

855
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:49,281
Then what's with
this mopey thing?

856
00:45:49,283 --> 00:45:50,751
Huh?

857
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:53,385
Do you know what you're
talking about here, sweetheart?

858
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:55,887
It's a practical joke.

859
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:58,192
No.
It's a fucking felony, honey.

860
00:45:59,393 --> 00:46:00,894
Look at me.

861
00:46:01,596 --> 00:46:04,830
We had a rough call
from the doctor this week...

862
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:06,566
and I think maybe
we're not thinking straight.

863
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:09,970
But that's why we'll go home...
- This has nothing to do with that.

864
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:12,940
You're so fucking stupid.

865
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:16,542
You want to be
a little fairy here?

866
00:46:16,544 --> 00:46:18,812
No, that's fine, okay?

867
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,313
You want your wife...

868
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:23,849
to look at you every day

869
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:25,786
like a pussy bitch?

870
00:46:26,086 --> 00:46:27,853
No, I can live like that.

871
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:29,522
Yeah.

872
00:46:29,524 --> 00:46:31,557
But I'm not sure that you can.
- Okay.

873
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:35,027
Okay.
- You need to be a big man here...

874
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:37,931
and teach people how
to respect you.

875
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:41,601
Nobody talks to your wife
the way that she did,

876
00:46:41,603 --> 00:46:43,969
because that is
disrespecting you.

877
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:45,470
Do you understand me?

878
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,005
Yeah.

879
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:48,842
Hey.
Hey, look at me.

880
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:54,882
Do you want me to look at
you like a fucking faggot, babe?

881
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:02,555
- No.
- No. No, you don't.

882
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:04,058
Okay.

883
00:47:04,526 --> 00:47:07,059
Yeah.

884
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:10,262
You guys are gonna make
the tallest, prettiest babies.

885
00:47:10,264 --> 00:47:12,600
- Oh, Kim.
- You are.

886
00:47:13,467 --> 00:47:15,601
Are we ready?
We're gonna do it.

887
00:47:15,603 --> 00:47:17,336
- I'm ready.
- Leave your phones.

888
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:19,237
- Hey. Hey!
- What?

889
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:21,475
- Leave your phones here.
- Why?

890
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:24,144
So they can't trace
that you've been there.

891
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:27,112
That's really smart.

892
00:47:27,114 --> 00:47:29,649
Okay. Okay, Craig. That's
actually really, really smart.

893
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:31,383
- Copy that.
- Yeah.

894
00:47:31,385 --> 00:47:32,984
Cheer up, softy.

895
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:34,622
Let's fucking do this.

896
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:36,390
Fuck.

897
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:42,062
I love you.

898
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:44,396
- Oh, God.
- My lady.

899
00:47:44,398 --> 00:47:46,998
- Why, thank you, my dear.
- Your chariot awaits.

900
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,400
Here I come.

901
00:47:56,544 --> 00:47:57,677
Ahem.

902
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:59,211
Hell yeah.

903
00:48:00,648 --> 00:48:02,447
- Ladies.
- Yeah.

904
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:04,149
Oh my God, I can't
believe we're doing this!

905
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:05,685
- No. Kim.
- What?

906
00:48:05,687 --> 00:48:07,653
- This stays here, right?
- Yeah, obviously.

907
00:48:07,655 --> 00:48:10,055
- Of course it does.
- Yeah. Of course, Em.

908
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:11,323
I can't believe
we're doing this.

909
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:12,558
I love you guys.

910
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,026
Let's turn that music on.

911
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:18,598
Oh my God.
I fucking love this song.

912
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,165
Yeah!

913
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:21,569
It's so fucking good.

914
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:32,210
Hey. Hey. Shh! Shut up.

915
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:34,012
Kim, can you turn
the music off, please?

916
00:48:34,014 --> 00:48:35,447
Fucking Jesus.

917
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:36,982
Turn it off, please.

918
00:48:36,984 --> 00:48:38,083
Fuck.

919
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,184
- Sorry.
- Craig...

920
00:48:39,186 --> 00:48:40,588
Buzzkill.

921
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:45,223
You know, it's not a big deal.

922
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:46,559
Okay, it's a little
bit of a big deal

923
00:48:46,561 --> 00:48:48,694
that Alice spilled
all over me...

924
00:48:48,696 --> 00:48:52,230
and ruined my favourite
sweater, but...

925
00:48:52,232 --> 00:48:54,132
- I think it'll come out.
- Yeah.

926
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:56,067
I just feel like she's
kind of clumsy.

927
00:48:56,069 --> 00:48:58,103
Is she the person that we
want to have taking our notes?

928
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:01,373
Yeah. She is physically
clumsy, but she is organized.

929
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:03,074
- Hey, hey, hey. Slow down.
- What?

930
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:05,277
- It's right here. Slow down.
- Sorry. Where? Left, right?

931
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,314
What?
- Right. Right. Turn right.

932
00:49:07,682 --> 00:49:09,582
Yeah.
Turn it slow. It's steep.

933
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:11,416
Oh, dear, that is steep.

934
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:13,353
Holy fuck.

935
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:17,757
Kim, we can talk about
Alice later, okay?

936
00:49:17,759 --> 00:49:19,991
- All right.
- Wait a second. Wait a second.

937
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:21,493
This bitch lives on the hill?

938
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:22,728
Yeah.
She lives on the hill.

939
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,664
What?
- I'm in a fucking duplex.

940
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:26,398
And she lives on
the fucking hill.

941
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,734
Yeah. Yeah.
All of this is hers.

942
00:49:28,736 --> 00:49:31,069
- Jesus.
- I bet she can see the lake from up here.

943
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:32,404
- She can.
- How do you know that?

944
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:33,773
We just passed
by a sign that said:

945
00:49:33,775 --> 00:49:35,307
"Leave all your troubles
behind."

946
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,409
I check up on her.
You know, I keep tabs on her.

947
00:49:37,411 --> 00:49:39,377
I'm in trouble.

948
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:41,248
You gotta let that go, baby.

949
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:43,685
Fuck that shit.

950
00:49:47,722 --> 00:49:50,222
Is this the only entrance
to the property?

951
00:49:50,224 --> 00:49:52,190
Well, to the street.
Yeah.

952
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:54,025
That's fucking risky,
don't you think?

953
00:49:54,027 --> 00:49:55,595
If somebody comes home,
we're stuck here.

954
00:49:55,597 --> 00:49:57,797
Well, then, okay. Well, then,
someone needs to stand watch.

955
00:49:57,799 --> 00:50:00,566
It's simple. This is it. This is it.
- Kim, hold on.

956
00:50:00,568 --> 00:50:02,502
Fucking shit.
- That's it? - Yeah.

957
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:06,039
That shed is fucking bigger
than my fucking apartment.

958
00:50:06,273 --> 00:50:07,773
Are there pets in there?

959
00:50:07,775 --> 00:50:10,010
I don't think so.
No.

960
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,045
No. I don't know.

961
00:50:12,246 --> 00:50:13,713
She lives by herself?

962
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:15,581
Yeah, I don't know.

963
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:17,683
Yes, she lives by her...
- It really matters that you know that.

964
00:50:17,685 --> 00:50:19,217
Yeah. Okay.
She lives by herself.

965
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:21,086
She inherited this place
when her mom died.

966
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:23,121
So, yes.
She lives here alone, Craig.

967
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:26,291
Prosecutor over here, Jesus.

968
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:27,793
Just an inquisition here.

969
00:50:27,795 --> 00:50:29,695
Fuck. All right.

970
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:32,197
It's as good a time
as any, I guess.

971
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:34,399
Five minutes and not a second
longer than that.

972
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:36,103
Hold on.

973
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,069
I'm gonna wait outside.
I don't want to know

974
00:50:38,071 --> 00:50:39,471
what the fuck you guys
were doing in there.

975
00:50:39,473 --> 00:50:40,806
When I come get you,
we're leaving. Okay?

976
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:43,141
- Yeah.
- Okay?

977
00:50:43,143 --> 00:50:46,779
Yes.
Yes, this is my sexy man!

978
00:50:46,781 --> 00:50:48,480
Oh my God.
There's the fucking lake.

979
00:50:48,482 --> 00:50:50,550
- He's gonna stand watch for us.
- That is fucked up.

980
00:50:50,552 --> 00:50:52,284
I'm sorry,
but I have a question.

981
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:54,252
Just pull it up here
and kill the engine.

982
00:50:54,254 --> 00:50:56,254
If she isn't even home,

983
00:50:56,256 --> 00:50:58,258
why do we only have
to be five minutes?

984
00:50:59,861 --> 00:51:01,694
Is she a good idea?

985
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:03,228
Honestly.
- Craig, she is fine. She's fine.

986
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,630
Craig, she works hard.
She's totally solid.

987
00:51:04,632 --> 00:51:06,131
Craig, you need
to fucking loosen up, man.

988
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:07,432
Yeah, Craig.
I'm solid.

989
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:09,802
Five minutes and not
a second longer than that.

990
00:51:09,804 --> 00:51:11,469
What do you think of that?

991
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:14,074
I'll bring the wine.

992
00:51:14,542 --> 00:51:16,341
- Jesus, man.
- Babe!

993
00:51:16,343 --> 00:51:18,243
We're just fucking having
a good time, man.

994
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:19,781
Babe, use your upper
body strength.

995
00:51:28,355 --> 00:51:30,424
- Kim, you're in the back.
- What? Okay.

996
00:51:33,628 --> 00:51:35,295
Fuck.

997
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:49,109
She has a kayak!
- Shut the fuck up.

998
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:51,711
Why do we need to be so quiet?

999
00:51:51,713 --> 00:51:53,445
She's not even home.
- Just shut the fuck up.

1000
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:55,715
I know, right? So dumb.
- Hold on. Hold on.

1001
00:51:55,717 --> 00:51:58,283
What? What?

1002
00:51:58,285 --> 00:52:00,686
I fucking hate this.
I have a really bad feeling.

1003
00:52:00,688 --> 00:52:03,522
There's too much space
between the house and the road.

1004
00:52:03,524 --> 00:52:05,423
We're not gonna get
everybody out unseen.

1005
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:06,828
Emily...

1006
00:52:20,775 --> 00:52:22,440
Does she have a dog?

1007
00:52:22,442 --> 00:52:24,177
I don't know.

1008
00:52:24,646 --> 00:52:27,379
- Shut up. Shut up.
- It's a puppy.

1009
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:29,515
What?
You can't take a dog, Craig?

1010
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:31,316
Shh, shh, hey, buddy.

1011
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:32,918
He's so cute.

1012
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,654
Wait, should I grab a rock?

1013
00:52:34,656 --> 00:52:36,254
And we can fucking throw
it through the window.

1014
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:37,422
No.

1015
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:38,691
You should look for
a hide-a-key.

1016
00:52:38,693 --> 00:52:40,593
A hide-a-key?
What the fuck is that?

1017
00:52:40,595 --> 00:52:43,361
Seriously?

1018
00:52:43,363 --> 00:52:45,665
- Leslie! Shh...
- I found it.

1019
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:47,633
It was really right
the fuck there?

1020
00:52:47,635 --> 00:52:49,367
Really right the fuck there.

1021
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:51,269
I'm surprised this bitch
hasn't been burgled before.

1022
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:53,238
Shut the fuck up.

1023
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,876
What?

1024
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:57,910
He's excited to see us.
- Get the dog.

1025
00:52:57,912 --> 00:53:00,515
Hello. Hello.
Come here.

1026
00:53:01,649 --> 00:53:03,883
Oh.
It's a big house.

1027
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:06,384
Oh my God.
- Baby.

1028
00:53:06,386 --> 00:53:08,386
- Oh my God.
- Oh, wow.

1029
00:53:08,388 --> 00:53:10,255
Look at these floors.
That's beautiful.

1030
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:12,290
Hey. Hey.

1031
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:13,859
Four minutes

1032
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:15,561
and I'm gonna wait outside.

1033
00:53:15,563 --> 00:53:17,897
- Cool.
- Kim, I'm not fucking around. Okay?

1034
00:53:17,899 --> 00:53:19,598
- I know.
- Man, you have lost a lot

1035
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,602
of your sense of humour
these days.

1036
00:53:22,235 --> 00:53:24,837
Oh my God.
She has a washer and a dryer.

1037
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,272
- Nice.
- Front loaders.

1038
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:28,808
I wonder if it's one
of those smart ones

1039
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,509
where you can control
it on your phone.

1040
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:32,878
What I would give...
never to go

1041
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,014
to the laundromat again.

1042
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:36,949
That's shitty art.

1043
00:53:36,951 --> 00:53:38,617
Aw, sweet baby.
- This is very shitty art.

1044
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:40,553
- It's shitty art.
- Let's see if we have anything to...

1045
00:53:40,555 --> 00:53:41,987
Yes!

1046
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:43,689
Save one of those beers for me.
Will you?

1047
00:53:43,691 --> 00:53:46,959
- Maybe. We'll see.
- Sweet baby. Look at this baby boy.

1048
00:53:46,961 --> 00:53:49,528
Look at this sweet baby boy.
- He's cute.

1049
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,697
He's so scared.
Where is your mommy?

1050
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:53,398
She left you alone.

1051
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,034
- Why did she leave you alone?
- Wait, what are we...

1052
00:53:55,036 --> 00:53:57,670
- Jesus Christ!
- Fuck, Marjorie.

1053
00:53:57,672 --> 00:53:59,739
Fuck me.
- Let me in.

1054
00:53:59,741 --> 00:54:02,777
Get in here.

1055
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:06,311
I'm sorry, am I being too loud?

1056
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:08,681
Craig. Craig!

1057
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:10,883
Fuck!

1058
00:54:10,885 --> 00:54:12,820
Are you fucking kidding me?

1059
00:54:13,286 --> 00:54:15,386
How do you turn...

1060
00:54:15,388 --> 00:54:16,722
Fuck.

1061
00:54:16,724 --> 00:54:18,389
Are you fucking kidding me?

1062
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:19,925
I always wanted
a fucking piano...

1063
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:22,630
but we could never afford one.

1064
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:25,531
Oh, fuck!

1065
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:32,472
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It just... fell.

1066
00:54:32,673 --> 00:54:34,607
I'm sorry.
- What did you do?

1067
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:36,976
- I just dropped the glass.
- Just clean it up, okay?

1068
00:54:36,978 --> 00:54:38,577
Okay.
I'm cleaning it up.

1069
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:39,945
No, this piano is a...
- Kim.

1070
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:42,715
- Yeah? Yes, Emily.
- Help me find the passport.

1071
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:44,852
I'm gonna check upstairs.

1072
00:54:48,923 --> 00:54:51,557
Can you hide in here?
Yeah.

1073
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:53,793
I always wanted
to play piano, but...

1074
00:54:53,795 --> 00:54:55,663
It's freezing up here.

1075
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:59,330
- Kim!
- Yeah!

1076
00:54:59,332 --> 00:55:01,033
- Are you upstairs?
- Yeah.

1077
00:55:01,035 --> 00:55:03,803
- Did you find anything?
- Not yet.

1078
00:55:03,805 --> 00:55:06,572
It's dark.
And, ooh, cold.

1079
00:55:06,574 --> 00:55:08,908
It's very...
Did you check under the bed?

1080
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:11,076
Yeah. I just did.
But I didn't see anything there.

1081
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:12,812
You checked the... Ouch!

1082
00:55:12,814 --> 00:55:14,713
See? See?

1083
00:55:14,715 --> 00:55:17,448
- What is with this ceiling?
- Us, tall, blonde models

1084
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,084
gotta worry about that,
don't we?

1085
00:55:19,086 --> 00:55:21,789
- Kim. Did you check in here?
- No. I mean, no, not there.

1086
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:25,423
- Oh, God.
- Found her underwear drawer.

1087
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:28,661
Eww! I bet they smell.

1088
00:55:28,663 --> 00:55:29,995
Let's see.
Let's see.

1089
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:31,530
It's like...

1090
00:55:31,532 --> 00:55:33,699
What? - I found it! I found it!
- You found it?

1091
00:55:33,701 --> 00:55:36,035
- I found it. - Wait!
- Oh my God! You found it.

1092
00:55:36,037 --> 00:55:38,103
- You found it?
- What are we doing with this?

1093
00:55:38,105 --> 00:55:40,005
Yes.
- We found it!

1094
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:41,674
We found the passport.

1095
00:55:41,676 --> 00:55:43,909
'Cause we know
this bitch is not American!

1096
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:46,645
Oh, we found the passport!

1097
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:48,514
I'm just playing
the fucking piano.

1098
00:55:48,516 --> 00:55:49,782
Jesus Christ.
- Who has a lighter?

1099
00:55:49,784 --> 00:55:52,618
- No, no, no. Let me do it.
- Oh my God, are we burning it?

1100
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,587
- Hey! - Let me do it.
- Kim.

1101
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:57,823
- I saw matches.
- That was not five minutes, Craig.

1102
00:55:57,825 --> 00:55:59,792
It absolutely was.
Please, can we go?

1103
00:55:59,794 --> 00:56:01,527
- It wasn't five.
- We shouldn't burn it here

1104
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:03,128
because there's
like smoke alarms.

1105
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,897
Leslie!

1106
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:06,464
Sorry. I'm not gonna
burn the house down.

1107
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:08,067
- Emily! Let's go! We'll burn it...
- Oh, my gosh.

1108
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:09,802
Let's burn it in your
fire pit at home.

1109
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:11,537
- Shh!
- But we should check...

1110
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:12,940
Shh!

1111
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:15,009
What?

1112
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:16,742
- Hide.
- What?

1113
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:18,143
- Hide right now!
- Oh my God.

1114
00:56:18,145 --> 00:56:20,512
- Hide and get out when you can.
- Oh my God. This way.

1115
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:22,081
- Fuck! - Shit.
- Fuck!

1116
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,751
Oh, shit.

1117
00:56:24,185 --> 00:56:26,118
- Move, move, move.
- Shit.

1118
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,657
Fuck!
I fucking told you.

1119
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:35,462
Is that better?

1120
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,497
Fuck!

1121
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:40,067
Fuck!

1122
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:49,644
Willie?

1123
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:52,580
Willie?

1124
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,818
She's leaving.

1125
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,053
Stop her. Get her.
Get her.

1126
00:57:02,757 --> 00:57:04,657
- Get her.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1127
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:05,691
Shit.

1128
00:57:05,693 --> 00:57:07,192
Oh my God.

1129
00:57:07,194 --> 00:57:08,994
It's okay.
Just don't move.

1130
00:57:08,996 --> 00:57:10,763
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

1131
00:57:10,765 --> 00:57:12,564
- Grab a chair.
- Here.

1132
00:57:12,566 --> 00:57:14,600
- Put her right there.
- I got it.

1133
00:57:14,602 --> 00:57:16,502
I got it.

1134
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:18,570
- Give me your hands.
- Shut the fuck up. It's okay.

1135
00:57:18,572 --> 00:57:21,040
- Give me your hands.
- I'm sorry. It's okay.

1136
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:23,509
It's just a practical joke,
okay? It's just a joke.

1137
00:57:23,511 --> 00:57:25,177
I'm sorry.
We're leaving. Okay?

1138
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:27,813
- Emily. What the fuck?
- We're leaving. What are you fucking doing?

1139
00:57:27,815 --> 00:57:30,115
What do you think I'm fucking doing?
I'm fucking holding her down.

1140
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:32,051
Kim, let's go.
Let's go.

1141
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:33,852
- Sorry. Let's go.
- Let's fucking go.

1142
00:57:33,854 --> 00:57:35,220
Kim, what the fuck
are you doing?

1143
00:57:36,891 --> 00:57:40,626
Shut up or I will
fucking kill you!

1144
00:57:40,628 --> 00:57:42,261
Do you fucking hear me?

1145
00:57:42,263 --> 00:57:44,797
This is all because you
fucking sassed us back there.

1146
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,265
Do you fucking understand this?

1147
00:57:46,267 --> 00:57:48,133
This is not funny
anymore at all.

1148
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,668
This is big trouble.
- Okay. It's okay.

1149
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:51,603
- What are we doing?
- Okay, I love my fucking job.

1150
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:52,771
- Em?
- And Terry needs me.

1151
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:54,139
I don't want to go
to fucking jail.

1152
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:56,508
It's okay. Just stop it.
Just stop it, Craig.

1153
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:59,044
Stop whining and whimpering
like a fucking cunt!

1154
00:57:59,046 --> 00:58:01,146
I'm sick of it! - Emily!
- We were just joking around.

1155
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:03,082
- What are we doing?
- What the fuck are you doing?

1156
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:04,683
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

1157
00:58:04,685 --> 00:58:06,919
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm trying to help.

1158
00:58:06,921 --> 00:58:08,153
Kim!

1159
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,857
Let's go.

1160
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:14,193
- Where is he going?
- He's fucking scared.

1161
00:58:14,195 --> 00:58:16,261
Jesus fucking Christ.

1162
00:58:19,233 --> 00:58:21,166
Hey. Hey.
It's okay. It's okay.

1163
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:23,235
- Stay. Stay, stay.
- Help!

1164
00:58:23,237 --> 00:58:24,737
Leave me alone!

1165
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:26,638
- Shh! It's okay.
- Stop!

1166
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,008
I'll explain.
I can explain, okay?

1167
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,976
We're gonna go inside now.
I'm gonna explain.

1168
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:33,946
Just please, come with me. Come with me.
- Stop! Stop! Please stop!

1169
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:35,981
Yeah, just come inside
and I'll fucking explain it to you.

1170
00:58:35,983 --> 00:58:38,784
Okay? Please? Just
come with me. I'm sorry.

1171
00:58:38,786 --> 00:58:41,120
I'm fucking sorry.
I'm sorry. It's just...

1172
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:44,289
Hold still. Okay?
Please! Fucking please!

1173
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:46,658
- Please stop!
- I don't wanna fucking hurt you.

1174
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,028
Okay? Please don't make me
fucking hurt you.

1175
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,996
Okay? Okay?

1176
00:58:50,998 --> 00:58:53,032
Just come on.
I'm sorry.

1177
00:58:53,034 --> 00:58:54,299
I'm fucking sorry.

1178
00:58:54,301 --> 00:58:56,602
Let's go inside.
Let's go inside.

1179
00:58:56,604 --> 00:58:59,038
Here. Okay?
Okay.

1180
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,173
Okay.
What the fuck?

1181
00:59:03,978 --> 00:59:06,781
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

1182
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:11,250
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop it.

1183
00:59:11,252 --> 00:59:14,053
Stop it.

1184
00:59:14,055 --> 00:59:16,590
Did you just shove
me, you fucking bitch?

1185
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:19,960
What the fuck is this?

1186
00:59:23,898 --> 00:59:25,664
Hey. Hey.
Hey, babe.

1187
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,833
Get the fuck off of me.
Get the fuck off of me!

1188
00:59:30,204 --> 00:59:31,670
Craig, where are you going?
Craig, Jesus!

1189
00:59:31,672 --> 00:59:33,739
- Craig!
- Craig! Craig!

1190
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:35,374
Craig! Craig!

1191
00:59:35,376 --> 00:59:37,309
We don't need him. Okay?

1192
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:39,978
We don't fucking need him.

1193
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:42,783
You don't need him.

1194
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,250
You are better than him.
He is a little fucking pussy.

1195
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:46,785
Do you understand?

1196
00:59:46,787 --> 00:59:48,887
We don't need him.

1197
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,055
Shut up, shut up.

1198
00:59:50,057 --> 00:59:51,957
Outside.
Everyone, outside to talk.

1199
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:53,826
Don't move. Don't move.

1200
00:59:53,828 --> 00:59:56,361
Outside now.
All of you.

1201
00:59:56,363 --> 00:59:59,698
We are fucking watching you!
Do you fucking understand that?

1202
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,668
That gun is on you at
all fucking times! Kim!

1203
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,805
- Yes. - Keep it on them!
- Yes.

1204
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:06,738
I got them. I got them.

1205
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,807
Okay.
They're moving closer.

1206
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:10,375
We gotta scare
the shit out of them.

1207
01:00:10,377 --> 01:00:12,344
They have seen our faces.
They know who we are.

1208
01:00:12,346 --> 01:00:14,146
Is that really gonna work
if we just scare them?

1209
01:00:14,148 --> 01:00:15,948
Yeah. We just have to scare
the shit of them.

1210
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:17,216
I don't know.
I don't know.

1211
01:00:17,218 --> 01:00:19,251
She's tough,
you know, she has...

1212
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:22,855
Then we really scare
the shit out of them.

1213
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:27,860
I can't, I can't.

1214
01:00:27,862 --> 01:00:29,761
Kim. Kim.

1215
01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:31,396
I need my babies.
I can't.

1216
01:00:31,398 --> 01:00:33,732
I understand.
And you can do this.

1217
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:35,934
I need you.
I can't do this alone, Kim.

1218
01:00:35,936 --> 01:00:37,936
Okay?
- Stop looking at me!

1219
01:00:37,938 --> 01:00:39,438
Okay, I need you to calm
down and think.

1220
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,373
- Yeah. Yeah, I am calm!
- Okay? You're calm. Okay.

1221
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:44,009
I think it's the only way.
Emily, it's the only way.

1222
01:00:44,011 --> 01:00:47,412
We just gotta go really hard and scare the
shit out of them and just fucking commit.

1223
01:00:47,414 --> 01:00:50,718
I mean, is there anything
else we're not thinking of?

1224
01:00:51,218 --> 01:00:53,285
They weren't supposed
to be fucking home.

1225
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:55,387
Okay, listen. Okay.
Everyone just needs to relax.

1226
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:58,390
All right? This shit isn't
that complicated.

1227
01:00:58,392 --> 01:01:01,360
Kim. Kim, you are tight

1228
01:01:01,362 --> 01:01:03,729
with every single fucking cop
that comes into the store.

1229
01:01:03,731 --> 01:01:05,264
I have seen it.

1230
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:09,034
If they ask us anything,
we'll deny it.

1231
01:01:09,036 --> 01:01:10,269
All right?
- Yeah.

1232
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,304
We will get rid of
all of our evidence.

1233
01:01:12,306 --> 01:01:15,240
Get rid of our fingerprints... everything
that we ever fucking touched in here.

1234
01:01:15,242 --> 01:01:17,943
Get rid of our trash
and that's it. All right?

1235
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:21,113
It's their word against
ours with no evidence.

1236
01:01:21,115 --> 01:01:24,049
And trust me, by the time I'm
fucking done with these bitches,

1237
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:25,784
I swear to God, they will
fucking leave town.

1238
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:27,886
All right? All right?

1239
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:29,888
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna fix this.

1240
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,990
Kim, I'm gonna fix this.

1241
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:33,727
All right?

1242
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:35,961
And this part will be fun.

1243
01:01:35,963 --> 01:01:37,029
Oh my God.

1244
01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:38,830
- We need to...
- Okay.

1245
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:40,401
- We need to...
- Shh.

1246
01:01:41,101 --> 01:01:43,304
Let's scare the shit
out of them.

1247
01:01:44,438 --> 01:01:45,906
We clean up.

1248
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,373
And we're out.
- We should leave right now.

1249
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:50,077
We should leave right now.
- Yeah.

1250
01:01:50,778 --> 01:01:52,246
Then leave.

1251
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:54,746
Just go.

1252
01:01:54,748 --> 01:01:56,050
Shit.

1253
01:01:57,818 --> 01:01:59,519
Okay. Are we gonna do it?

1254
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:02,354
Why would you show up for a
meeting dressed like a fucking whore?

1255
01:02:02,356 --> 01:02:04,024
Disrespect!

1256
01:02:04,325 --> 01:02:06,225
Get the fuck in here!
- Oh my God.

1257
01:02:06,227 --> 01:02:08,528
Fuck! Will you help
me? Please, Marjorie?

1258
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:11,396
I just wanted some fucking
wine! Jesus fucking Christ!

1259
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:13,865
- They're touching each other.
- Okay. I got it!

1260
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:16,768
I got it! Kim!
I got it!

1261
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:19,271
- Jesus Christ!
- Let go. Let go.

1262
01:02:19,273 --> 01:02:21,907
- Get the fuck off of her.
- Jesus.

1263
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:25,077
Jesus fucking Christ.

1264
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:26,445
Stop moving!

1265
01:02:26,447 --> 01:02:29,281
This is all because you decided

1266
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:31,483
to stand the fuck up
for yourself.

1267
01:02:31,485 --> 01:02:33,185
Calm down.

1268
01:02:33,187 --> 01:02:34,953
Emily. Emily.
- Hey, little bitch.

1269
01:02:34,955 --> 01:02:36,955
Hey, little bitch.
I need your fucking phone.

1270
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:38,790
I need to play some
fucking music.

1271
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:40,292
Oh! Hold on.
You know what?

1272
01:02:40,294 --> 01:02:42,294
I bet you her phone
is in her purse.

1273
01:02:42,296 --> 01:02:44,296
Wonder if you have any
more whore money.

1274
01:02:44,298 --> 01:02:46,031
Okay. Fuck. Okay.

1275
01:02:46,033 --> 01:02:47,466
This is the United
States of America.

1276
01:02:47,468 --> 01:02:49,368
- Oh, shit.
- It's not your fucking country, is it?

1277
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:51,069
- Okay. Wait. Will you take her phone?
- Wait.

1278
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:53,238
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Yeah. That's...

1279
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,209
What kind of tunes
do you like, honey?

1280
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:59,478
- Emily! Emily, please just let my sister go!
- Got it!

1281
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,380
All right, let's see...

1282
01:03:01,382 --> 01:03:03,048
- Oh, wait...
- Got it.

1283
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,017
You want us to let
your sister go?

1284
01:03:07,087 --> 01:03:08,887
You want her to be let go?

1285
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:10,590
Okay. Maybe we should
let her go.

1286
01:03:10,592 --> 01:03:13,125
Well, you know what actually,
you look so frail.

1287
01:03:13,127 --> 01:03:16,194
How about we feed her?

1288
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:17,929
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1289
01:03:17,931 --> 01:03:22,234
Maybe get some food
in her. It's protein.

1290
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:24,970
Yeah.
How about you, Marjorie?

1291
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:28,006
How about we feed her?

1292
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:30,042
Shut up.
Get the fuck away from me.

1293
01:03:30,044 --> 01:03:32,344
Stop moving.
Stop fucking with your sister.

1294
01:03:32,346 --> 01:03:34,112
Calm down.
I'm not gonna break you.

1295
01:03:34,114 --> 01:03:35,548
I'm just gonna fucking feed you.

1296
01:03:38,352 --> 01:03:40,287
Get her fucking hands.

1297
01:03:41,955 --> 01:03:44,022
Open up.
Open your mouth.

1298
01:03:44,024 --> 01:03:47,560
Here you go.
How about a banana?

1299
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:50,429
Yeah. You wanna come
with us and eat a banana?

1300
01:03:50,431 --> 01:03:53,500
- Have some banana.
- I think she's finding it a little dry.

1301
01:03:56,638 --> 01:03:59,541
A little liquid.
A little liquid.

1302
01:04:06,213 --> 01:04:08,215
Oh. There it is.
Here you go.

1303
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:10,550
Are you fucking thirsty?

1304
01:04:10,552 --> 01:04:12,451
Get it open.

1305
01:04:12,453 --> 01:04:14,252
Here you go.
Here you go.

1306
01:04:14,254 --> 01:04:15,989
She's thirsty.

1307
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:20,025
Your hair is so dry, baby doll.

1308
01:04:20,027 --> 01:04:22,194
Did you steal that
whiskey from my fucking store?

1309
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:24,630
Let's moisturize it for you.

1310
01:04:45,919 --> 01:04:49,221
There you go.
There you go.

1311
01:04:49,223 --> 01:04:51,559
Stop moving! Stop it!

1312
01:04:53,427 --> 01:04:56,529
Marjorie!
What are you doing?

1313
01:04:56,531 --> 01:04:58,566
I'm taking a video
with her phone.

1314
01:04:58,966 --> 01:05:00,966
What are you doing?

1315
01:05:00,968 --> 01:05:03,201
What did you not understand
about leaving no trace?

1316
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:05,971
- Well, I just thought it was a fucking video.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1317
01:05:07,575 --> 01:05:10,242
Hey! Look at me.
Look at me.

1318
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:13,145
Look at me.
Look at me.

1319
01:05:13,147 --> 01:05:16,047
Were we ever here?

1320
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:17,650
- Were we ever here?
- Were we ever here?

1321
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:20,586
- Were we ever fucking here?
- Were we ever here?

1322
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:24,324
- You liar.
- Are you ever gonna fucking say anything?

1323
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:27,259
You are a lying little
whore, aren't you?

1324
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:29,062
Were we ever here?

1325
01:05:29,363 --> 01:05:31,631
She's choking.
- She's choking.

1326
01:05:31,633 --> 01:05:34,266
She is choking. Oh my
God. Hit her on the back.

1327
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:36,636
Hit her on the back.
- Get it off.

1328
01:05:36,638 --> 01:05:38,671
Get it off.
A little help here!

1329
01:05:38,673 --> 01:05:40,706
Fuck! Fuck!

1330
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,642
What is wrong with her?

1331
01:05:42,644 --> 01:05:44,710
What is wrong with her?
- What is wrong with her?

1332
01:05:44,712 --> 01:05:46,411
- What is wrong?
- Get her up.

1333
01:05:46,413 --> 01:05:48,146
She's choking.
Oh my God.

1334
01:05:48,148 --> 01:05:50,215
Oh my God.
What's wrong with her?

1335
01:05:50,217 --> 01:05:53,318
Peanuts! Peanuts.
She's allergic to peanuts.

1336
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,588
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

1337
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:58,524
Get her EpiPen in
the purse in my room, please.

1338
01:05:58,526 --> 01:06:01,092
I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.

1339
01:06:01,094 --> 01:06:04,630
Please. Please. Please. I can't...
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

1340
01:06:04,632 --> 01:06:06,398
Lily. No, no, no.

1341
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,234
Oh my God.
What the fuck is that?

1342
01:06:09,236 --> 01:06:11,269
Hurry!
Oh, no, no.

1343
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:14,139
Fuck. Holy shit.
Fucking shit.

1344
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:15,641
- Oh my God.
- Look at me.

1345
01:06:15,643 --> 01:06:18,410
- Oh my God.
- Lily. Lily. Lily.

1346
01:06:18,412 --> 01:06:21,480
Look at me, Lily.
Open, no. No, no, no.

1347
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:23,315
Stay with me, baby.
Stay with me.

1348
01:06:23,317 --> 01:06:26,017
I love you, baby. Don't...

1349
01:06:26,019 --> 01:06:28,320
Epinephrine
for allergic reactions.

1350
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:30,190
Hurry!
Give it to her!

1351
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:32,727
Kinda looks like we're
too late though.

1352
01:06:40,735 --> 01:06:42,234
No.

1353
01:06:42,236 --> 01:06:45,370
Oh, no, no, no.

1354
01:06:45,372 --> 01:06:47,405
- Fuck. Fuck!
- Oh, no, baby.

1355
01:06:47,407 --> 01:06:49,474
- Shit. Oh my God.
- Lily.

1356
01:06:49,476 --> 01:06:51,042
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Lily, wake up.

1357
01:06:51,044 --> 01:06:53,044
- What's happened to her?
- Oh, no, no, no.

1358
01:06:53,046 --> 01:06:55,681
What did you do?

1359
01:06:55,683 --> 01:06:57,550
Oh, God.

1360
01:06:57,552 --> 01:06:59,519
You did it to yourselves.

1361
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:03,221
She fucking resisted.
She fought back.

1362
01:07:03,223 --> 01:07:06,157
It would've been easier for her if
she'd stopped and had some respect.

1363
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:08,360
- Why did you do this?
- It's her fault. It's her fault.

1364
01:07:08,362 --> 01:07:11,129
No, baby. Wake up,
Lily. I love you.

1365
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:15,066
No, no, no, no, no.

1366
01:07:15,068 --> 01:07:18,470
Wake up. Wake up.
Oh, no, no, no.

1367
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,782
Oh, no.

1368
01:07:31,184 --> 01:07:32,818
Kim, what are you doing?

1369
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,588
- We have to make sure that...
- Take these.

1370
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,422
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

1371
01:07:37,424 --> 01:07:39,124
We have to make sure this
place is spotless.

1372
01:07:39,126 --> 01:07:41,192
We have to wipe down
every surface.

1373
01:07:41,194 --> 01:07:42,595
We have to take all
of our trash.

1374
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:45,598
- What about her?
- I am not losing my kids.

1375
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,365
Do you understand me?
I'm not.

1376
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:49,334
None of this has gone
the way I wanted it to go.

1377
01:07:49,336 --> 01:07:51,871
Try to relax! Okay?

1378
01:07:51,873 --> 01:07:54,540
You! You!
You did this!

1379
01:07:54,542 --> 01:07:56,408
- I didn't do anything!
- You did this!

1380
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:58,443
You trash!
We did this for you!

1381
01:07:58,445 --> 01:08:01,179
- No, I didn't!
- You did this! You did!

1382
01:08:01,181 --> 01:08:03,783
We did this for your
ass so fuck you!

1383
01:08:03,785 --> 01:08:05,785
Shut up! Shut up!

1384
01:08:05,787 --> 01:08:07,587
It is nobody's fucking fault!

1385
01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:08,888
We didn't fucking know

1386
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,590
that she was fucking
allergic to peanuts.

1387
01:08:10,592 --> 01:08:12,558
So shut up!

1388
01:08:47,528 --> 01:08:49,194
Marjorie.

1389
01:08:49,196 --> 01:08:50,565
Marjorie!

1390
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:52,900
Get in here!

1391
01:08:54,267 --> 01:08:55,735
Kim.
- What?

1392
01:08:55,737 --> 01:08:57,270
Come here.

1393
01:08:57,505 --> 01:09:00,173
We all need to get
gloves on, okay?

1394
01:09:00,775 --> 01:09:02,273
What?

1395
01:09:02,275 --> 01:09:04,244
Put gloves on.

1396
01:09:09,717 --> 01:09:11,416
Oh my God.

1397
01:09:11,418 --> 01:09:13,286
We need to make it
look like a rape.

1398
01:09:14,287 --> 01:09:15,788
What?

1399
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:19,359
No one's ever gonna suspect
women if they're raped.

1400
01:09:21,629 --> 01:09:23,696
Why are you looking at me?
I'm not gonna fucking do it.

1401
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:25,330
Kim, I'm not asking
you to do it.

1402
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:26,866
I can't...

1403
01:09:26,868 --> 01:09:28,868
I can't...
We should go.

1404
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:31,837
No!
We need to clean up our mess.

1405
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,873
Look, it's no one's fault, okay?

1406
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:35,306
Just do it.

1407
01:09:35,308 --> 01:09:36,811
I'm going to.

1408
01:09:37,612 --> 01:09:40,780
- I am helping clean.
- I need a fucking carrot.

1409
01:09:40,782 --> 01:09:42,782
I'll just keep cleaning.
Oh, God.

1410
01:09:42,784 --> 01:09:45,553
We shouldn't have worn shoes.
I'll tell you that much.

1411
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:50,455
No. No. No.

1412
01:09:50,457 --> 01:09:53,626
Shut the fuck up.
Shut up!

1413
01:09:53,628 --> 01:09:56,496
No! No!

1414
01:09:56,798 --> 01:10:00,902
This is how you learn.

1415
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:05,403
You deserve it.

1416
01:10:05,405 --> 01:10:08,373
Oh, God.
Oh my God.

1417
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:10,241
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1418
01:10:10,243 --> 01:10:13,012
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1419
01:10:14,782 --> 01:10:16,784
Oh my God.

1420
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:27,392
Bitch.

1421
01:10:40,273 --> 01:10:44,677
I'm... I'm really sorry
that I yelled at you.

1422
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:46,946
Okay?
- Okay.

1423
01:10:46,948 --> 01:10:50,348
I was just really,
really panicked.

1424
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:51,550
I know.

1425
01:10:51,552 --> 01:10:53,320
And you didn't do
anything wrong.

1426
01:10:56,289 --> 01:11:00,458
And I don't think I can do it.

1427
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:02,262
And...

1428
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:06,966
I know that you're
really strong.

1429
01:11:06,968 --> 01:11:08,603
So...

1430
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:10,335
Yeah.

1431
01:11:10,337 --> 01:11:12,339
Yeah, I'll do it.

1432
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,342
I'll do this for you.

1433
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,845
And then you'll model
my clothes for me.

1434
01:11:18,378 --> 01:11:20,648
What?

1435
01:11:21,249 --> 01:11:23,816
My clothes.
For the online store.

1436
01:11:23,818 --> 01:11:25,985
You'll model them.

1437
01:11:25,987 --> 01:11:28,623
Oh, God.
- Yeah.

1438
01:11:31,993 --> 01:11:33,795
Oh, God.

1439
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:40,398
I'm gonna throw up.
Kim.

1440
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,102
Go outside
and find something for the body.

1441
01:11:43,104 --> 01:11:44,906
Okay?

1442
01:11:45,372 --> 01:11:47,405
Oh, Jesus. Fuck.

1443
01:12:09,764 --> 01:12:11,098
Fuck.

1444
01:12:15,603 --> 01:12:17,503
I found this.

1445
01:12:17,505 --> 01:12:19,972
I don't know what to do.
- That works. That works.

1446
01:12:19,974 --> 01:12:22,375
Okay. Okay.

1447
01:12:23,144 --> 01:12:24,944
- Marjorie.
- What?

1448
01:12:24,946 --> 01:12:26,612
Come help me.

1449
01:12:26,614 --> 01:12:28,348
Come help me.

1450
01:12:28,616 --> 01:12:31,116
Come help me.
- What the fuck?

1451
01:12:31,118 --> 01:12:33,384
All of our trash goes in here.

1452
01:12:33,386 --> 01:12:34,789
Okay?

1453
01:12:36,557 --> 01:12:38,057
Oh my God.

1454
01:12:38,059 --> 01:12:40,025
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1455
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:42,761
Breathe.

1456
01:12:42,763 --> 01:12:44,830
Breathe.
I need you to breathe.

1457
01:12:44,832 --> 01:12:46,431
Okay?

1458
01:12:46,433 --> 01:12:48,667
Can you carry these cans?

1459
01:12:48,669 --> 01:12:51,070
- Okay.
- Can you carry these cans?

1460
01:12:51,072 --> 01:12:53,639
Okay. Good. Good.

1461
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:55,975
Where are we taking them?

1462
01:12:55,977 --> 01:12:58,777
- We're taking it to the lake.
- Okay.

1463
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:00,946
And the bag needs to sink, okay?

1464
01:13:00,948 --> 01:13:03,849
- Oh, fuck.
- Can you carry these?

1465
01:13:03,851 --> 01:13:06,852
Breathe.
- Okay. Yeah.

1466
01:13:06,854 --> 01:13:08,988
Breathe. Breathe.

1467
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:10,522
Okay. Okay.

1468
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:12,091
I'll just take them to the car.

1469
01:13:12,093 --> 01:13:14,128
Take them. Okay.

1470
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:27,407
Fuck.

1471
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,855
Fuck.

1472
01:13:49,597 --> 01:13:51,764
Guys, we have to go.

1473
01:13:51,766 --> 01:13:52,965
Right now.

1474
01:13:52,967 --> 01:13:54,802
All right.

1475
01:13:55,236 --> 01:13:57,002
Fuck, they're heavy.

1476
01:13:57,004 --> 01:13:59,472
- Push it.
- I got it. I got it.

1477
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:02,675
Don't slip, her fucking
spit's all on the floor.

1478
01:14:02,677 --> 01:14:04,777
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

1479
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:07,715
Fuck. Fuck.

1480
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:10,952
Fuck. Fuck.

1481
01:14:12,485 --> 01:14:13,619
Okay.

1482
01:14:13,621 --> 01:14:15,654
Okay. Okay.

1483
01:14:15,656 --> 01:14:17,457
Okay.

1484
01:14:18,526 --> 01:14:19,994
Okay...

1485
01:14:21,896 --> 01:14:23,862
Got to clean.

1486
01:14:23,864 --> 01:14:25,698
Got to clean this.

1487
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:27,168
Fuck.

1488
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:38,946
Okay.

1489
01:14:46,053 --> 01:14:48,155
Okay. Okay.

1490
01:15:03,537 --> 01:15:05,239
Okay...

1491
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:21,088
Okay, okay...

1492
01:15:35,803 --> 01:15:37,302
Emily, hurry up!

1493
01:15:37,304 --> 01:15:39,571
What the fuck are you
doing in there?

1494
01:15:39,573 --> 01:15:40,939
Okay.

1495
01:15:40,941 --> 01:15:42,141
Okay.

1496
01:15:42,143 --> 01:15:44,111
Okay, okay.

1497
01:15:56,157 --> 01:15:58,159
Fuck...

1498
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:03,030
Fuck!

1499
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:05,330
Go! Get out.

1500
01:16:05,332 --> 01:16:07,735
Go. Okay.

1501
01:16:08,969 --> 01:16:10,836
Okay, stay. Stay. Stay.

1502
01:16:10,838 --> 01:16:12,840
Okay. Okay.

1503
01:16:13,374 --> 01:16:14,975
Oh, fuck.

1504
01:16:32,326 --> 01:16:33,826
She is fucking heavy!

1505
01:16:33,828 --> 01:16:35,027
Marjorie, will you help me?

1506
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:36,829
Get your shit together.

1507
01:16:36,831 --> 01:16:38,732
Jesus!

1508
01:16:39,066 --> 01:16:42,167
Marjorie, just take another
fucking shot or something!

1509
01:16:45,406 --> 01:16:47,806
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1510
01:16:47,808 --> 01:16:49,775
Breathe. Breathe.

1511
01:16:49,777 --> 01:16:51,643
Breathe. Breathe.

1512
01:16:51,645 --> 01:16:53,946
Breathe. Breathe.

1513
01:16:53,948 --> 01:16:56,215
Okay. Okay.

1514
01:16:56,217 --> 01:16:58,150
Okay.

1515
01:16:58,152 --> 01:16:59,685
Listen to me.

1516
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:01,286
- Okay.
- We need you to get in the car.

1517
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:03,388
Get in the car.
- Okay. Yeah.

1518
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:05,059
Okay.

1519
01:17:07,928 --> 01:17:09,228
Are we good?

1520
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,696
We're good.

1521
01:17:10,698 --> 01:17:12,366
Just get in the fucking car.

1522
01:17:17,738 --> 01:17:19,773
Get in the fucking car!

1523
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:28,749
- Did you get everything?
- I got everything.

1524
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:30,550
After we dump them,

1525
01:17:30,552 --> 01:17:33,318
we gotta come back here and
we gotta clean everything.

1526
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,020
- Okay.
- Carefully.

1527
01:17:35,022 --> 01:17:36,388
Okay?
- Okay.

1528
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:38,056
Yes.

1529
01:17:38,058 --> 01:17:42,094
Every single inch
and we'll erase fingerprints.

1530
01:17:42,096 --> 01:17:44,263
- Everything will be spotless.
- Everything.

1531
01:17:44,265 --> 01:17:47,132
It will be fine.
No one.

1532
01:17:47,134 --> 01:17:50,271
No one will know we were there.
No one will ever find out.

1533
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:52,437
Okay?

1534
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:53,939
Oh, fuck.

1535
01:18:01,348 --> 01:18:02,714
You're okay.

1536
01:18:02,716 --> 01:18:04,016
We're okay.

1537
01:18:04,018 --> 01:18:05,417
Huh...

1538
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:07,288
Is...

1539
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:10,255
- Is your boat...
- Where are we going?

1540
01:18:10,257 --> 01:18:13,158
Where is your boat? I
don't... It's by the pier.

1541
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,896
- Which pier?
- The one by that abandoned house.

1542
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:18,897
By the... Okay.

1543
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:20,399
We're gonna take
them there, okay?

1544
01:18:20,401 --> 01:18:22,736
We should just be
burying them in the woods.

1545
01:18:23,771 --> 01:18:26,471
With what, Leslie?

1546
01:18:26,473 --> 01:18:28,106
With a fucking shovel!

1547
01:18:28,108 --> 01:18:29,441
Where are we gonna get
a fucking shovel?

1548
01:18:29,443 --> 01:18:30,943
I bet you they fucking had one!

1549
01:18:30,945 --> 01:18:32,744
- Will you just shut the fuck up?
- Fuck you!

1550
01:18:32,746 --> 01:18:34,913
- Shut the fuck up!
- You are the one who fucking told us...

1551
01:18:34,915 --> 01:18:36,748
- Shut up!
- ...so don't piss me the fuck off!

1552
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,984
- This is your fucking fault!
- You are screaming at me! Fuck you!

1553
01:18:38,986 --> 01:18:40,485
I did this for you!
I have good ideas!

1554
01:18:40,487 --> 01:18:43,188
I could get the fuck out
of this car right now,

1555
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:44,756
then you're on your fucking own!

1556
01:18:44,758 --> 01:18:46,058
- Okay. Okay.
- Do you understand me?

1557
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,893
No, no, no. Please.

1558
01:18:47,895 --> 01:18:51,263
Calm down. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1559
01:18:51,265 --> 01:18:53,033
I'm sorry.

1560
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:55,269
I'm sorry.

1561
01:19:03,944 --> 01:19:05,978
Test me again, Emily,

1562
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:08,282
and see where it
fucking gets you.

1563
01:20:19,353 --> 01:20:21,221
Kim, are we almost there?

1564
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:25,159
- Are we almost there?
- Yes. Yes.

1565
01:20:33,067 --> 01:20:35,568
Marjorie, if you reach
into the glove compartment...

1566
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:39,371
there should be
a headlamp in there

1567
01:20:39,373 --> 01:20:41,108
from one of my kiddos.

1568
01:20:42,109 --> 01:20:43,477
Okay.

1569
01:20:44,178 --> 01:20:45,545
Just...

1570
01:20:45,547 --> 01:20:47,647
- I got it.
- Did you get it?

1571
01:20:47,649 --> 01:20:49,283
- Yeah, I got it.
- Okay, good.

1572
01:20:50,951 --> 01:20:53,485
I'll get... I'll get out,
and...

1573
01:20:53,487 --> 01:20:55,253
Wait for the car to pass us.

1574
01:20:55,255 --> 01:20:56,922
...and open the gate.
Yeah.

1575
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:30,625
Kim.

1576
01:21:36,664 --> 01:21:38,298
Come on.

1577
01:21:40,934 --> 01:21:42,403
Come on.

1578
01:21:42,936 --> 01:21:44,271
Okay.

1579
01:21:47,609 --> 01:21:50,442
Marjorie, sorry I need that
headlamp that my boy left in there.

1580
01:21:50,444 --> 01:21:52,277
- Listen. - What?
- You're gonna need this.

1581
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:55,046
Yeah. Thank you. You're
gonna pull the car around...

1582
01:21:55,048 --> 01:21:57,650
and bring the bag down to
the shore and meet me, okay?

1583
01:21:57,652 --> 01:21:59,353
Okay.

1584
01:21:59,953 --> 01:22:01,355
Okay.

1585
01:23:24,539 --> 01:23:26,240
No...

1586
01:23:39,721 --> 01:23:41,288
Fuck.

1587
01:23:59,574 --> 01:24:01,141
Fuck!

1588
01:24:02,744 --> 01:24:04,376
God damn it.

1589
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:05,613
Fuck!

1590
01:24:05,847 --> 01:24:07,314
Oh!

1591
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,119
Fuck.

1592
01:24:14,121 --> 01:24:15,220
Fuck me.

1593
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:16,556
Fuck.

1594
01:24:16,558 --> 01:24:18,593
Okay. Okay.

1595
01:24:29,436 --> 01:24:31,271
Okay. Okay.

1596
01:24:31,573 --> 01:24:33,440
Okay. Okay.

1597
01:24:33,675 --> 01:24:35,710
Okay. Okay...

1598
01:24:39,379 --> 01:24:41,148
Fuck.

1599
01:24:50,525 --> 01:24:51,724
Okay.

1600
01:24:51,726 --> 01:24:53,391
You're okay.

1601
01:24:53,393 --> 01:24:54,727
We need to get them on the boat.

1602
01:24:54,729 --> 01:24:56,394
I'm pushing.
I'm pushing.

1603
01:24:56,396 --> 01:24:58,332
- Yeah.
- Got it?

1604
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,566
I'm coming.

1605
01:25:00,568 --> 01:25:02,500
I'm coming. - Emily, you okay?
- Oh my God.

1606
01:25:02,502 --> 01:25:04,469
Coming. I'm coming.
I'm coming. Whoa!

1607
01:25:04,471 --> 01:25:06,271
Be quiet.
- Okay.

1608
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:08,676
The house is abandoned.
No one's gonna fucking hear us.

1609
01:25:10,143 --> 01:25:11,877
- One, two.
- Three.

1610
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,282
- Fuck.
- Okay.

1611
01:25:17,284 --> 01:25:19,152
You get on that side, Kim.

1612
01:25:19,921 --> 01:25:21,921
Okay, so pull.
We're pulling it.

1613
01:25:21,923 --> 01:25:23,758
- Push.
- Push.

1614
01:25:25,893 --> 01:25:27,560
Keep going.

1615
01:25:27,562 --> 01:25:29,227
We got to get out of the mud.

1616
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,333
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

1617
01:25:35,335 --> 01:25:37,435
Marjorie, get in
the back and help.

1618
01:25:37,437 --> 01:25:39,304
Okay.
I'll go around.

1619
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:42,708
- Get up.
- Get in there.

1620
01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:45,276
Jesus. I'm trying to!
Help!

1621
01:25:45,278 --> 01:25:46,748
Okay.

1622
01:25:49,651 --> 01:25:51,751
See?
You needed a fucking friend.

1623
01:25:51,753 --> 01:25:54,654
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1624
01:25:54,656 --> 01:25:56,689
One of you in here with me.

1625
01:25:56,691 --> 01:25:58,358
I'll go.

1626
01:26:01,328 --> 01:26:02,595
Shit.

1627
01:26:02,597 --> 01:26:04,431
Okay.

1628
01:26:04,766 --> 01:26:06,331
Okay.

1629
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:08,168
Push us. Ready?

1630
01:26:10,705 --> 01:26:11,704
One.

1631
01:26:11,706 --> 01:26:12,972
Idiots!

1632
01:26:12,974 --> 01:26:14,707
Fuck you, Marjorie!

1633
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:16,276
Fuck you.

1634
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:18,211
Just fucking go.

1635
01:26:21,281 --> 01:26:22,882
It's getting too deep.

1636
01:26:22,884 --> 01:26:24,650
I can't push any farther.

1637
01:26:24,652 --> 01:26:25,785
Emily?

1638
01:26:25,787 --> 01:26:27,953
One, two, go!

1639
01:26:27,955 --> 01:26:29,287
Sorry.

1640
01:26:29,289 --> 01:26:31,592
One, two, three.

1641
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,663
One, two, three.

1642
01:26:37,497 --> 01:26:39,199
Fuck.

1643
01:26:57,317 --> 01:27:00,420
One, two, three.
- Three.

1644
01:27:00,855 --> 01:27:03,858
One, two, three.

1645
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:08,529
Here?
- Further.

1646
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,466
- Here?
- Further.

1647
01:27:14,468 --> 01:27:16,436
Jesus Christ.

1648
01:27:24,344 --> 01:27:25,780
Here?

1649
01:27:26,948 --> 01:27:29,817
Here. Okay.
Here.

1650
01:27:35,523 --> 01:27:37,792
Help me.
- I'm helping.

1651
01:27:40,962 --> 01:27:42,563
Fucking...

1652
01:28:02,415 --> 01:28:03,885
We did it.

1653
01:28:06,521 --> 01:28:08,055
We did it.

1654
01:28:09,422 --> 01:28:11,993
Leslie, we did it.

1655
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:14,494
Let's go.

1656
01:28:15,129 --> 01:28:17,863
Turn. Turn.
One, two, three.

1657
01:28:17,865 --> 01:28:19,667
Hold on.
