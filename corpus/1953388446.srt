1
00:00:29,935 --> 00:00:31,027
Hey, Pete.

2
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,503
You're not leaving already,
are you?

3
00:00:32,538 --> 00:00:35,029
Uh, no, it's...
my wife is waiting up for me.

4
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:36,098
Come on.

5
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:37,301
One more drink, huh?

6
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:39,436
I have a little
going-away present for you.

7
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:42,936
I, uh...
I got you a raise.

8
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:44,176
I know it must be tough
for you

9
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:45,774
trying to start a family
in this economy.

10
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:48,343
Now, it's not much,
$2,000 a year.

11
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:49,854
I tried to make it more,

12
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:52,015
but only VPs
make that kind of money.

13
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:54,992
And the company policy
is pretty firm on it, so...

14
00:00:55,027 --> 00:00:56,085
Thank you for that.

15
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:57,493
It's my pleasure.

16
00:00:57,529 --> 00:00:59,156
Do you have any idea
who's replacing you?

17
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:02,826
No.
Uh, yeah, it's a woman.

18
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:04,665
I don't know her.

19
00:01:04,703 --> 00:01:08,469
She's coming from Slater's,
ACS banner out west.

20
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:12,169
And all I heard about her,
she's a real ballbuster.

21
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:15,011
So good luck with that,
my friend.

22
00:01:16,147 --> 00:01:17,774
The last seven years
in this department

23
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:19,783
have been, um...

24
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:22,513
have been some of
the most meaningful in my life.

25
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:26,455
No, I'm being serious
for a moment.

26
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:29,517
A lot has happened,
a lot of great memories.

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,256
My second child was born
while I've been working here.

28
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:35,289
Some of you were there
at his baptism.

29
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:39,365
You're all like family to me,
and, uh...

30
00:01:41,806 --> 00:01:43,899
I hate to say it, but I'm
gonna miss you all very much.

31
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:45,306
So...

32
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:47,703
Cheers, cheers, huh?

33
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:48,905
- To Jim.
- All right.

34
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:50,811
Thank you to all of you.
Cheers, cheers.

35
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,906
Cheers.

36
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:16,135
# Iceman, iceman,
candy man, and sandman #

37
00:02:16,174 --> 00:02:18,642
# All the things
I wanted for #

38
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:21,042
# Someone else took them #

39
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:25,345
# Lonely in a new shirt,
lonely watching baseball #

40
00:02:25,383 --> 00:02:29,683
# If I had to do it all again,
I wouldn't #

41
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:33,213
# Throw it all away #

42
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:39,490
# Throw it all away #

43
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:43,488
# I want a holiday #

44
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:44,557
# I want #

45
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:52,437
Sorry.
I couldn't get away.

46
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:53,443
Did you eat?

47
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:55,172
I had some nachos.

48
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:58,112
What is this?

49
00:02:58,148 --> 00:03:00,480
- That's to fix the car.
- $1,500.

50
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:01,643
What was wrong with it?

51
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:03,312
I don't know.
Something with the brakes.

52
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:04,650
Hey, could you put Henry
to sleep?

53
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:06,519
He's driving me crazy.

54
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:08,183
Kids, it's me, Racer Steve!

55
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:09,351
And I'm Princess Katie.

56
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:11,361
Welcome to our...

57
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:12,521
Come on, buddy.

58
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:13,529
Time for bed.

59
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:14,530
No.

60
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:15,690
Come on.

61
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:17,893
We don't go to bed.

62
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,298
Dad, get it.

63
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:30,680
- This message
is for Pete Cozy.

64
00:03:30,714 --> 00:03:32,944
I'm calling
from Banking Services Credit.

65
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:34,109
It would have been more,

66
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:37,279
but he would had
to have made me vice president.

67
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,083
So why didn't he make you
vice president?

68
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:40,817
I don't know.
I guess it's a big deal.

69
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:42,222
We could use the money.

70
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:45,885
I don't want
to be vice president.

71
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:47,897
I don't want any more
responsibility at that place

72
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:49,626
than I already have.

73
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,635
I mean, vice presidents
stay late at the office.

74
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:53,795
They work weekends.

75
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:55,304
I don't want to do that.

76
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:56,929
I want to do my job,
come home,

77
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:59,668
and spend as much time
with my family as I can.

78
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,700
Did you ever hear back
from that other job?

79
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:03,905
No.

80
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:05,880
Not yet.

81
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:27,431
What's up?

82
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,962
It's her new car,
our new boss.

83
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:32,633
Looks brand-new.

84
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:34,302
- Did you see her?
- Nope.

85
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:37,244
We got a meeting at 10:00
in the conference room.

86
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:48,185
- Morning.
- I feel like shit.

87
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:49,782
Being human sucks.

88
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:51,190
I hope someone brought
doughnuts.

89
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:53,354
I'm starving.

90
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,132
Just look at this.

91
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,929
Look at him.
There he is.

92
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:05,570
Have you seen him?

93
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:07,508
- Her.
- He's a she.

94
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:08,805
No way.

95
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:09,811
You didn't know?

96
00:05:09,845 --> 00:05:11,244
No, no shit.

97
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,304
I hope she's hot.

98
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:14,316
Hi, everybody.

99
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,284
I'd like to introduce myself

100
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:17,649
and tell you all
a little bit about

101
00:05:17,686 --> 00:05:19,676
what we'll be doing
for the next few months.

102
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:22,019
My name is Susan Felders.

103
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:25,355
I've been in pricing
and marketing for 11 years.

104
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,418
Before moving to ACS,

105
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:32,092
I was president of pricing
at Safeway, SoCal region.

106
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:35,227
ACS then hired me to run
their Slater's Markets banner,

107
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,704
200 stores on the West Coast.

108
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:40,435
And here I am at Wolski's.

109
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:41,874
I'm passing out my résumé.

110
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,208
My cell phone number's
at the top.

111
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:46,042
Wolski's
is the lowest performance banner

112
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,105
on the ACS chain.

113
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:50,014
We are losing sales.

114
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:53,782
Our stores
look like time vaults from 1985.

115
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,812
Our corporate image
has nothing to do

116
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:57,950
with pricing or value.

117
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,482
What we have, mostly,
is locations.

118
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,791
You know, we're the store
that managed to stay in business

119
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,854
when Walmart
opened down by the highway.

120
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:05,388
We're the store
for the little old lady

121
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:08,368
who takes ten minutes
counting out exact change,

122
00:06:08,403 --> 00:06:10,598
the store for the husband
who forgot to buy milk

123
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,196
at the Super Saver.

124
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,707
Now, I took this job
to change that.

125
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,073
We are gonna change that,

126
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,975
starting here,

127
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:19,343
right now,

128
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,144
in this room.

129
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:23,172
- Hey...
- Hi, Matt, right?

130
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,377
I know you all
have a lot of questions,

131
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,977
and I will have answers
for you.

132
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,386
But I don't want to waste
anyone's time in a conference.

133
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:29,822
I will be meeting
with each one of you

134
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:30,824
in the next few days,

135
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:31,984
So thank you.

136
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:33,152
This is exciting.

137
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:38,726
She's hot.

138
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,862
Hi, Brian.

139
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,566
Hey, it's Pete Cozy.

140
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,033
Yeah, no...

141
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,369
Okay, um...

142
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,484
Do you know of anyone else
that might be hiring?

143
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:11,888
Can I help you?

144
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,456
Hi, Pete, right?

145
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,094
I was just checking out
your playlists.

146
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,933
- I approve.
- Thank you.

147
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,064
I was just curious 'cause
all the jobs on your résumé

148
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,540
were in the music industry.

149
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,008
It's not every day
someone transfers

150
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,271
to the supermarket business.

151
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,643
How'd you end up here?

152
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,704
I don't know.

153
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,514
Is there anything fun
to do around here?

154
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,814
See any good shows?

155
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,344
I don't really get out much.

156
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,515
- I have a kid.
- Aww.

157
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,784
Boy or girl?

158
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,985
A boy.

159
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,494
His name's Henry.
He's three.

160
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,689
That's so cute.

161
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,433
I'd like to talk to you
outside of the office

162
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,130
for a few minutes,
a more casual atmosphere.

163
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:55,870
But if you have to go home,
I totally understand.

164
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,342
- I don't mind
that she's coming over.

165
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,504
I just wish you would have
given me some time to prepare.

166
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,309
- She's just coming over
for a drink.

167
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:02,746
She's not expecting
anything.

168
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,010
The place is a mess.

169
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,540
- Seemed like
the easiest thing to do.

170
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,445
Hey, come on in.

171
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,785
I was so lost.

172
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,484
I didn't realize
you had it so rough.

173
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,516
- Oh, no,
it's not a bad neighborhood.

174
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,458
Oh, okay.

175
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,695
I needed to get out of L.A.

176
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,062
I was in a lousy relationship.

177
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,158
It wasn't working out
at Slater's.

178
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,829
ACS made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

179
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,167
They said
if I took over here,

180
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,730
I could do anything
I wanted.

181
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,572
We are going to transform
this company.

182
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,077
Wow.

183
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,546
You know, I don't even know
what Pete does, actually.

184
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,446
- 'Cause it sounds so boring
when I talk about it.

185
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,711
- Really?
- Yeah.

186
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,719
I love talking shop.

187
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,880
Our department takes data

188
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,549
that represents
customers' behavior,

189
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,887
like what customers
are buying.

190
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,393
It then translates that data
into strategies

191
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,895
that can be used in stores
to increase sales.

192
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,363
- Oh, you mean
like putting soda cans

193
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,592
at the ends of the aisle.

194
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:56,567
- Yeah, that kind of thing,
but so much more.

195
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,263
Look, you guys
drink organic milk, right?

196
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,293
Yeah.

197
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,670
- Right, one child,
suburban,

198
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,675
I know how much you make.

199
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,472
You're an easy demographic.

200
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,413
I bet I could guess
75% of what's in your fridge.

201
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,144
I mean, the stuff you buy
doesn't happen by accident.

202
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,813
What do you do, Sara?

203
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,415
- I'm not actually working
right now.

204
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,322
You know, raising Henry
is a full-time job.

205
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,951
She's going back to work soon.

206
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,053
Yeah, maybe.

207
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:26,891
Oh, what is that?

208
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:29,161
- We're having a Halloween party
at the office.

209
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,258
Spouses are invited.

210
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:31,666
On Halloween?

211
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:33,193
Yeah, when else?

212
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,330
Oh, you know what?

213
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:35,464
That's Henry's party.

214
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,065
They're having
a little Halloween party

215
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:38,234
at his school, so...

216
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:40,574
- It's earlier,
so we could go to both.

217
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:42,978
Can I come?

218
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:44,003
To Henry's party?

219
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:47,017
- Yeah,
unless it's not cool.

220
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:49,951
No.
I guess it would be okay.

221
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:50,955
Good night.

222
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:51,956
No.

223
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,957
I better go too.

224
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:59,463
Here's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

225
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:01,727
A lot of bosses coming into
a department like this

226
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:03,791
would lay off
a lot of people.

227
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,427
I don't have time
to go out and rehire.

228
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,734
We're just going to have to work
with what we have.

229
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:11,208
But I do have to fire someone,
just to trim costs.

230
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,266
Mm.

231
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,504
It's not you, obviously.

232
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:15,342
But I thought you might know
who it should be.

233
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,008
Who is the worst performer
in the office?

234
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:20,017
Who's bringing morale down?
- Can I think about it?

235
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:21,541
- No, I don't want you
to think about it.

236
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:23,679
I'm sure as soon as I said it,
a name came into your head.

237
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:25,882
- Matt Davis?
- Really?

238
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:26,982
Why him?

239
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,390
He's always missing deadlines.

240
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:31,452
I mean,
he's kind of half-assed.

241
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:32,622
What about Tony Gomes?

242
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:33,756
Tony?

243
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:34,822
No.

244
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,163
I mean,
I think we should keep him.

245
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,896
He's all right.

246
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,267
He's a good worker.

247
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:40,328
All right.

248
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:41,895
Thanks.

249
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,567
I'm glad I asked you that.

250
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:44,632
Good morning.

251
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:45,802
- Good morning.
Wolski's.

252
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,174
Yes, mm-hmm, please hold.

253
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:52,011
What's going on?

254
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:53,846
She fired Tony.

255
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:55,681
No way.

256
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:58,381
She wants to see you too.

257
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:09,688
Dude...

258
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:12,769
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:15,363
I hated this place anyway.

260
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,033
Yeah, come in.

261
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:21,710
Shut the door.

262
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,585
- I thought
you weren't gonna fire Tony.

263
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:29,881
I never said that.

264
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,478
I just wanted your opinion.

265
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:32,852
He's got four kids.

266
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,948
I don't feel good about it.

267
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:35,288
Firing people sucks.

268
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:37,122
It's sweet that
you're worried about his kids,

269
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,218
but he was slacking.

270
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:39,388
He wasn't happy here.

271
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:40,919
Sit.

272
00:11:42,132 --> 00:11:43,531
We've got a lot of work
to do here.

273
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:44,864
We don't have time
to fuck around,

274
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:46,028
feeling bad for Tony Gomes.

275
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:47,366
He'll land on his feet.

276
00:11:47,404 --> 00:11:49,065
Sit.

277
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:54,207
When I was working at Slater's,
I hired a company

278
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:56,109
called Intellichoice
to look over our stores

279
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:57,443
and to suggest strategies.

280
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:59,608
These guys are cutting-edge.

281
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,878
Yeah, they're consultants.

282
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:03,284
- Yeah, they're very good
at what they do.

283
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,947
When the preliminary results
came in,

284
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:06,785
I was blown away.

285
00:12:06,823 --> 00:12:09,052
And my boss at Slater's,
an asshole named D'asarlo,

286
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:10,718
decided to can
the whole thing.

287
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,091
Why?

288
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:14,028
Because he's an asshole.

289
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:15,189
He didn't give me a reason.

290
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,960
He said it was his decision,
and that was it.

291
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,557
And that's what pissed me off.

292
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:21,035
So I did something that
I probably shouldn't have done,

293
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,402
which is, I went to his boss
at ACS, Jack Bennington,

294
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,737
to try to get him
to change D'asarlo's mind.

295
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:28,869
Bennington didn't like the idea,
but he offered me this job.

296
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:30,936
- Where you can do
whatever you want.

297
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,106
Yeah.

298
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:33,615
Slater's is a banner
under ACS,

299
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:35,480
so as far as I'm concerned,

300
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:38,817
ACS owns the strategies
that Intellichoice came up with.

301
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:40,321
I'm counting on you
to understand

302
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:41,914
what's behind
these strategies.

303
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,220
But you can handle that,
right?

304
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:45,090
You went to Dartmouth.
- Yeah.

305
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:46,719
How did you know
I went to Dartmouth?

306
00:12:46,762 --> 00:12:48,662
- It's on your résumé...
Dartmouth, economics,

307
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:49,995
Sony Music, Matador Records.

308
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:52,330
I need someone
I can count on, Pete, okay,

309
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:54,768
someone
who's not gonna bullshit me.

310
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:58,035
You be honest with me,
and I'll be honest with you.

311
00:12:58,074 --> 00:12:59,701
- Okay?
- Sure.

312
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:01,232
- Miss Felders,
Ernie on line one.

313
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:04,772
It's the guy I left in L.A.

314
00:13:04,814 --> 00:13:07,009
He's turning into a stalker.

315
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:08,175
I'll talk to you later.

316
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:10,185
Don't forget those files.

317
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:12,050
Those books are for you too.

318
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,318
Hey, what's up?

319
00:13:15,358 --> 00:13:17,952
Would you stop?

320
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:20,656
I'm not going to talk to you
if you're gonna cry.

321
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:25,030
- That guy
has been calling nonstop.

322
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:27,365
Good.
You got all those files.

323
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:28,893
Here's some more for you.

324
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:29,996
I can't keep up with her.

325
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,232
She's stressing me out.

326
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:33,866
Halloween party.
Fun, fun, fun.

327
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:35,136
What are you gonna be?

328
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:37,076
Oh, I'm not dressing up.

329
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:39,307
- Oh, yes, you are...
costume mandatory.

330
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:40,871
Read the memo,
fun, fun, fun.

331
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:42,143
Ernie!

332
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:43,480
I'm gonna be Condoleezza Rice.

333
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,349
Do you think people
still remember who she is?

334
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:49,187
- I'm not the one
who peed in the bed!

335
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:50,452
Fuck you!

336
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:53,082
Under no circumstances

337
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:54,425
do his calls
come into my office.

338
00:13:54,462 --> 00:13:56,259
He's a fucking asshole.

339
00:13:56,297 --> 00:13:57,457
Is Matt Davis here yet?

340
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:58,864
No, he's late.

341
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,733
- He better get his fucking ass
in here soon.

342
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:14,906
Oh, Henry, Daddy's...

343
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,678
Sara!

344
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:18,515
- Why do you have to read
all this stuff for work?

345
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,350
You never had to read anything
for work before.

346
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:21,855
- This is exactly
the kind of thing

347
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,380
I've spent my whole life
avoiding.

348
00:14:23,425 --> 00:14:24,687
- Why don't you
find another job?

349
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:26,284
- What do you think
I've been trying to do?

350
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:27,885
I'm sorry.

351
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:29,692
- Hello, this is Gary
calling from MasterCard

352
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:31,722
regarding the past-due balance
on your account.

353
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:32,824
I thought you paid them.

354
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:34,334
With what?

355
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:36,860
- Look, just send them $30
so they stop calling.

356
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:38,133
Okay, I will.

357
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:40,539
I will take Henry,
and I will go and read to him.

358
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:42,133
- No.
- I love you.

359
00:14:42,177 --> 00:14:44,611
Say, "I love you, Daddy. "
- No.

360
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,767
"I miss your smells...

361
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:20,269
"your breath, sweat, feet,
armpits,

362
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:22,145
the back of your leg
when it was hot out. "

363
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:23,479
What the hell is that?

364
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:24,779
Oh, Susan's boyfriend in L.A.

365
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:26,080
He faxed this last night.

366
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,849
It's totally screwed up.
- This guy's crazy.

367
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:29,082
- Read that thing
about the toy.

368
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:30,283
Yeah.

369
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:33,952
- "When you put yourself
inside me,

370
00:15:33,994 --> 00:15:35,962
"it wasn't just a toy.

371
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:38,624
It was your love in my ass. "

372
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,792
Where'd you find that?

373
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,495
- I found it on the fax machine
when I came in.

374
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:43,525
I made a copy of it.

375
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,060
It's, like, 12 pages long.

376
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:46,970
- No one's ever written me
a letter that long.

377
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:49,168
- Shut up, you guys.
Here she comes.

378
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:53,276
Good morning.

379
00:15:53,313 --> 00:15:55,247
Morning.

380
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:56,340
Who gets this coffee?

381
00:15:56,383 --> 00:15:57,680
It's really good.

382
00:15:57,718 --> 00:16:00,312
- Doug.
He's really weird about coffee.

383
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:01,844
Doug, ah.

384
00:16:03,757 --> 00:16:04,883
So does everybody know

385
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:07,826
what they're gonna be
for Halloween?

386
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:11,024
- Well, I was thinking
something from Toy Story maybe.

387
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:13,699
Okay, you're not weird.

388
00:16:14,768 --> 00:16:16,200
Did I miss something?

389
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:19,363
- I think he just choked
on his doughnut.

390
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:21,532
- Speaking of,
can we just nix these things?

391
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:23,542
They're totally gross.

392
00:16:23,576 --> 00:16:25,203
Let's have something
a little healthier.

393
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:26,643
Mm-hmm.

394
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:29,671
- There seems to be too much
snacking going on here anyway.

395
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,911
Did she just call me fat?

396
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:39,447
Do I look fat to you?

397
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,622
Fuck.

398
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:46,730
You wanted to see me.

399
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:48,563
Yeah, shut the door.

400
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:57,439
I'm giving you a raise.

401
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,376
I figure with Henry
and the house and everything,

402
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:00,572
you could use it.

403
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:02,080
$40,000.

404
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:03,274
Does that sound fair?

405
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:07,352
- That's what I make
right now.

406
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:09,718
- Yeah, so after that,
you'll make $80,000, okay?

407
00:17:09,755 --> 00:17:12,690
I... thank you.

408
00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:16,525
I thought only vice presidents
make that kind of money.

409
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:18,655
- Yeah.
You're a vice president now.

410
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:21,326
Congratulations.

411
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,597
Isn't that a big deal?

412
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:25,968
- Mm-mm, not for somebody
who went to Dartmouth.

413
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:27,870
You should be making more
than that if you ask me.

414
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:29,704
How old are you?
- 36.

415
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:31,369
- Yeah, what are you
waiting for?

416
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,604
You're married.
You have a kid.

417
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:33,942
What are you going to do
when Henry

418
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,969
wants to go to Dartmouth?

419
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:37,777
How are you gonna pay
for that?

420
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:39,716
- That's not really
your problem.

421
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:42,276
Of course not.

422
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:55,697
The truth is...

423
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:59,070
I need you on my team.

424
00:17:59,104 --> 00:18:00,537
We've got a ton of work
to do here,

425
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:02,472
and I need to be able
to count on you.

426
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,740
Did you look at those files
I gave you yesterday?

427
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:07,142
Yeah, some of them.

428
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:12,745
What about Todd Kenner
from Intellichoice?

429
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:14,752
Have you talked to him yet?

430
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:16,515
- I didn't know
I was supposed to.

431
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,750
Get his number from Donna.

432
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,588
He's coming in next week
to help get us started.

433
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:22,752
He's an interesting guy.

434
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:24,284
You'll like him.

435
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,662
I want to get three or four
of his strategies

436
00:18:32,704 --> 00:18:35,969
into our stores in two weeks.

437
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:37,804
Two weeks?

438
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:41,607
No, no, no,
it takes us two months

439
00:18:41,646 --> 00:18:43,011
to turn around
the scanning data...

440
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:47,849
- Kroger has three departments
doing what we do here,

441
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:49,649
and they have better data.

442
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:52,851
Safeway outspends us
five to one on R&D,

443
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:55,826
and they're upgrading
their entire checkout system

444
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,157
next month.

445
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:58,662
But we're not Safeway.

446
00:18:58,697 --> 00:18:59,721
Exactly.

447
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,390
And we cannot compete
with them

448
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,900
unless we pull our thumbs
out of our asses!

449
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,401
Come on!

450
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,030
How did you guys get to be
so fucking lazy?

451
00:19:08,072 --> 00:19:11,166
It's like moving wet sandbags
around here!

452
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,540
Oh, Christ...

453
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:17,505
I'm sorry.
I...

454
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:19,345
I raised my voice.

455
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:20,543
I'm sorry.

456
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:24,748
I'm PMS'ing.

457
00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:30,083
It's just frustrating.

458
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,321
It's just frustrating.

459
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:43,206
I know this isn't
what you were planning on doing

460
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,936
for the rest of your life,
but you're a smart guy.

461
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,434
You could do a lot worse
and make a lot less doing it.

462
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,313
So if you want out,
tell me now.

463
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:55,545
I'm in.

464
00:19:55,586 --> 00:19:56,883
Good.

465
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,013
I want you to pick out
three or four easy strategies

466
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:00,489
that will give us
results quickly

467
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:02,048
because I want some momentum
from those

468
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:04,526
that we can use to roll out
some of the tougher stuff.

469
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:05,994
Okay.

470
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:08,589
- Oh, I'm still invited
to Henry's party, right?

471
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:09,963
Yeah.

472
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,558
Good.

473
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:12,728
Thanks, Pete.

474
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:16,936
Give this to Donna
on the way out.

475
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:21,237
What are you doing here?

476
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:22,835
- I'm waiting for you
to get out of there.

477
00:20:24,914 --> 00:20:25,881
How was your meeting?

478
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:28,110
It was good.

479
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:29,448
That's exactly
the kind of joke

480
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:31,180
my wife would get mad at me
for making.

481
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,380
Yeah, but she'd laugh.

482
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:34,185
Maybe.

483
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:35,281
Oh, I know how it is.

484
00:20:35,324 --> 00:20:36,621
I was married.

485
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:38,786
Been there.
Sucked.

486
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:40,989
You know what the trouble
with marriage is?

487
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,328
It turns women into wives.

488
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,891
See, women laugh at your jokes
and dress nice

489
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:47,664
and suck your cock.

490
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:48,795
Wives don't put out

491
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,305
and talk to you
like you're retarded.

492
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:53,407
- When was the last time
you got laid?

493
00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:54,774
No comment.

494
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:58,713
- I've had sex 136 times
in the last six months.

495
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:01,546
I'm a numbers guy.
I can't help counting.

496
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:04,246
16 different women.
16.

497
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:06,255
- For an average
of 81/2 times each.

498
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:07,620
Well, the mean is lower.

499
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:08,851
It was mostly with one woman.

500
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:11,621
The absolute deviation
is around 3.6.

501
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:14,562
But you should have seen
those stats when I was married.

502
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:16,087
Are you married, Donna?

503
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:17,121
No.

504
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,827
No?

505
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:23,838
That's not funny.

506
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:25,340
You could get fired for that.

507
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:27,467
I didn't do it.

508
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,671
Halloween party tomorrow.

509
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:32,340
- I'm gonna be
Rudolph Valentino.

510
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:35,350
He was a movie star
during the silent era.

511
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:36,749
I know who he is, Doug.

512
00:21:36,786 --> 00:21:38,481
Mm-hmm.

513
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:39,920
- Can you get out of my desk,
please?

514
00:21:44,793 --> 00:21:46,260
Where's your costume?

515
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:47,727
- Oh, parents
don't really dress up.

516
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:48,922
I'm gonna change later.

517
00:21:48,964 --> 00:21:51,091
- You need to get
in the spirit of things.

518
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:53,123
This is supposed to be fun.

519
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:18,188
You like that, huh?

520
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:20,854
It's part of my costume.

521
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:22,090
You ever hear these guys?

522
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:25,730
Sure, it's Luna.

523
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:26,893
I love these guys.

524
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:28,994
I do too.

525
00:22:29,037 --> 00:22:31,801
- I actually tried to sign them
back when I worked at Sony.

526
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,467
No way.

527
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:34,873
I followed them around
one summer

528
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,036
when I was in college.

529
00:22:36,077 --> 00:22:38,068
- Really?
Yeah, Dean's awesome.

530
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:39,944
Yeah, he is...

531
00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:47,179
Even though
he doesn't remember me.

532
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:51,282
# Oh, I wish
I were a little bar of soap #

533
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:54,295
# Oh, I wish
I were a little bar of soap #

534
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:55,694
# I would slippy
and I'd slidey #

535
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,754
# Over everybody's body #

536
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:57,856
Hi, Henry!

537
00:22:57,899 --> 00:22:59,867
- Hi.
You must be Henry's mother.

538
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:02,734
- No, I'm not,
but this is Henry's dad.

539
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:04,432
Hey, you.

540
00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:06,598
I love your costume.

541
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,767
I'm not wearing a costume.

542
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:11,039
Oh, okay.

543
00:23:11,078 --> 00:23:12,705
- I think it's time
for everyone

544
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:16,341
to play Pin the Nose
on the Pumpkin, yes.

545
00:23:16,383 --> 00:23:17,509
Yeah!

546
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:18,643
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

547
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:20,551
- You know what,
parents can join too.

548
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:21,987
Yay!

549
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:23,990
- And welcome.
- Thank you.

550
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:25,992
- Why don't you take your coat
off and stay awhile?

551
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:27,459
- I feel a little weird
that no one else

552
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:29,121
is wearing a costume,
but okay.

553
00:23:29,163 --> 00:23:30,130
- I am.
- All right.

554
00:23:30,164 --> 00:23:31,131
- All right.
- Let's do it.

555
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:33,156
Okay, here we go.
Happy Halloween!

556
00:23:35,502 --> 00:23:36,696
# We dress ourselves
in stripes and dots #

557
00:23:36,737 --> 00:23:38,329
- Sorry I'm late.
Hey.

558
00:23:38,372 --> 00:23:40,203
Look.

559
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,406
# We dress ourselves
without interference #

560
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:49,780
# We dress ourselves
in greens and blues #

561
00:23:49,817 --> 00:23:52,047
- None of these people
are your friends, though, right?

562
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:53,519
- No.
- No.

563
00:23:53,554 --> 00:23:54,851
Well, I'm your friend now.

564
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:58,219
- Do you see that sign
over there?

565
00:23:58,258 --> 00:23:59,589
Where?

566
00:23:59,627 --> 00:24:01,288
- I know, you can't see it.
It's right there.

567
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:02,693
Oh, yeah.

568
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,061
Yeah.

569
00:24:04,098 --> 00:24:05,929
Who's it for?

570
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,593
Is it for the kids?

571
00:24:07,635 --> 00:24:09,034
- They can't read.
- I know.

572
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:10,502
So it's...
it's for the parents,

573
00:24:10,537 --> 00:24:13,802
but it's... it's so high
that you can't see it.

574
00:24:13,841 --> 00:24:15,570
It's a good sign.

575
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:17,338
You should put it
where you can see it.

576
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:18,402
Yeah.

577
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,310
That's part of my job.

578
00:24:20,347 --> 00:24:23,248
I put signs
where you can see them.

579
00:24:23,283 --> 00:24:26,480
You'd be surprised
at how hard it is to do.

580
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:31,681
I wish the people in the office
were as fun as those kids.

581
00:24:31,724 --> 00:24:33,055
They're not so bad.

582
00:24:33,092 --> 00:24:35,083
- Oh, come on,
you hate them.

583
00:24:36,696 --> 00:24:38,061
I mean,
none of you guys are friends

584
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:39,359
outside of the office,
are you?

585
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:40,661
Not with me.

586
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,327
- That's one of the reasons
why it's so hard

587
00:24:42,368 --> 00:24:43,858
to get any momentum
on anything.

588
00:24:43,903 --> 00:24:47,498
Everything just stops at 5:45.

589
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,304
Don't you ever look forward
to going to work?

590
00:24:51,844 --> 00:24:54,608
I'd like to welcome everyone
to the first annual

591
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:58,481
Wolski's pricing and marketing
Halloween party, yeah!

592
00:24:58,518 --> 00:25:00,418
Yeah.

593
00:25:00,453 --> 00:25:01,886
Oh, come on.

594
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:05,118
I had better reception
at my dad's old age home.

595
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:07,888
I want to welcome everyone
to the first annual

596
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:11,795
Wolski's pricing and marketing
Halloween party!

597
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:18,362
All right, that's better.

598
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:19,996
I want you all
to drink and dance

599
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:22,030
and mingle
and have fun tonight.

600
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:25,533
This is the last fun you're
gonna have until Christmas,

601
00:25:25,578 --> 00:25:27,944
and no one leaves
until they karaoke.

602
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,347
I'm serious.

603
00:25:31,384 --> 00:25:35,218
So I'm gonna sing a song
by one of my favorite bands,

604
00:25:35,254 --> 00:25:38,018
Luna, and also
one of Pete's favorite bands.

605
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:53,196
# Do I #

606
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:56,366
# Oh, do I #

607
00:25:56,408 --> 00:25:57,807
# Remain #

608
00:25:58,944 --> 00:26:02,880
# In your mind? #

609
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:05,712
# Only #

610
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:10,017
# To poison the love #

611
00:26:11,723 --> 00:26:15,022
# That we find #

612
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,359
# Desires have misplaced,
our wishes are washes #

613
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:21,422
# The air is filled
with vibrations #

614
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:24,128
# I'm crying for you,
you're crying for me #

615
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:27,536
# From station to station
to station #

616
00:26:27,572 --> 00:26:29,938
# Holding each other
tighter #

617
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:33,069
# The sky goes by, dear #

618
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:34,544
# Cries in the streets #

619
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:38,709
# I am the meat
in your heart #

620
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,911
# Open your sandwich to me #

621
00:26:42,387 --> 00:26:43,445
# Open it up #

622
00:26:43,488 --> 00:26:45,479
Thank you.

623
00:26:46,892 --> 00:26:47,859
Nice song, Matt.

624
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:48,860
Oh, Pete.

625
00:26:48,894 --> 00:26:50,054
Huh?

626
00:26:50,095 --> 00:26:53,394
- Hey, I heard
about what you said to Susan,

627
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:55,365
about how you
wanted me fired, and...

628
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,662
- I didn't...
- No, no.

629
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:58,896
I want to say this.

630
00:26:58,937 --> 00:27:01,030
Fuck you,
you two-faced prick.

631
00:27:01,072 --> 00:27:02,232
I thought you were a cool guy.

632
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:04,242
But no,
you're just another asshole.

633
00:27:04,276 --> 00:27:06,073
Don't talk to me.

634
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:07,942
Dick.

635
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:12,750
- Hey.
- Hey.

636
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:14,683
You all right?

637
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,117
Peachy, yeah.

638
00:27:16,153 --> 00:27:17,745
What's eating you?

639
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:20,188
- Happy Halloween.
- Hi.

640
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:22,520
I got us some shots!

641
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,460
Whoo-ooh!

642
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:27,953
Oh, yeah, shots.

643
00:27:27,998 --> 00:27:29,761
# I heard it on the radio,
and it's about time #

644
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,926
# To play something like... #

645
00:27:30,968 --> 00:27:32,094
Bet you wouldn't mind

646
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:33,660
getting in the middle
of those two, huh?

647
00:27:33,704 --> 00:27:35,262
Yeah, right.

648
00:27:35,306 --> 00:27:37,103
- Wish me luck, buddy.
I'm going in.

649
00:27:37,141 --> 00:27:38,301
Go and get 'em.

650
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:39,934
# When I felt
that I needed to pump #

651
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:43,174
# It's on the radio,
on the radio, on the radio #

652
00:27:43,214 --> 00:27:45,182
# And it sounded
a little something like this #

653
00:27:45,216 --> 00:27:46,308
Oh, my God.

654
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,318
She's high-energy.
- Yeah, she is.

655
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,479
- Oh, we're gonna go
to the city this weekend, okay?

656
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:51,988
- Who?
- Susan and I.

657
00:27:52,022 --> 00:27:53,580
We're gonna take Henry
to the Met.

658
00:27:53,624 --> 00:27:55,592
- Oh, good, yeah,
I have work to do this weekend.

659
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:56,650
Perfect.

660
00:27:56,694 --> 00:28:00,790
# And crown thy good with #

661
00:28:00,831 --> 00:28:01,820
Brotherhood.

662
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:02,855
Yeah.

663
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,768
# From sea to shining sea #

664
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:10,070
# Oh, beautiful... #

665
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,335
Good night, ladies.

666
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,637
- Bye.
- It was so nice to meet you.

667
00:28:12,676 --> 00:28:14,200
- Nice to meet you.
- Get home safe, okay?

668
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:16,839
- Hey, do you know
where Susan is?

669
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:18,109
No.

670
00:28:18,148 --> 00:28:19,672
- I really wanted
to say good-bye.

671
00:28:19,717 --> 00:28:21,446
Come on, it's okay.

672
00:28:21,485 --> 00:28:22,816
I'll be fine.

673
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:24,844
What is she, like, a witch?

674
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:39,901
- Todd Kenner from Intellichoice
is coming tomorrow.

675
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:41,335
We don't get a lot of time
with him,

676
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:44,204
so I want everyone
on top of their game.

677
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,071
Okay?

678
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:48,134
Uh, Pete, do you
have the latest planograms?

679
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:49,701
- I do.
They're right here.

680
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:51,646
- Oh, don't forget
to check the vendor contracts.

681
00:28:51,681 --> 00:28:53,308
If you need help with a vendor,
let me know.

682
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:54,338
I know how to talk to them.

683
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:55,373
Okay.

684
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:57,386
- Dave, are the new computers
up yet?

685
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,581
- They're all up.
I'm still fixing the network.

686
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:01,749
Oh, wow, Dave.

687
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,315
I didn't know
you had it in you.

688
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,554
Big applause.

689
00:29:05,595 --> 00:29:06,926
Come on.

690
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:10,395
Doug,
I want to see a rough layout

691
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:11,923
for the store manager
presentation.

692
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:13,595
You can use some
of the old stuff for now,

693
00:29:13,636 --> 00:29:15,695
but I want to see a new look.

694
00:29:15,738 --> 00:29:18,502
The old stuff
looked like homework.

695
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:21,806
I want it to look like
a magazine,

696
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:24,074
emphasis on profit.

697
00:29:24,113 --> 00:29:26,047
Understand?

698
00:29:26,082 --> 00:29:28,277
- Whatever you say,
Susie Q.

699
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:32,517
What did you call me?

700
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:33,647
What?

701
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,487
Nothing.

702
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:37,618
Yes, you did.

703
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,787
What did you call me?

704
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:42,627
Susie Q.

705
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:44,155
I didn't mean anything.

706
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:47,870
No.

707
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,532
I...

708
00:29:50,573 --> 00:29:53,201
I think it's nice.

709
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:57,008
I think everyone
should have nicknames.

710
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,876
It's a great idea.

711
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:03,382
From now on,
yours is Assface.

712
00:30:03,418 --> 00:30:06,546
So let's get those layouts done,
Assface.

713
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:09,380
All right.

714
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:11,449
"All right, Susie Q."

715
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:14,223
Right, Assface?

716
00:30:14,262 --> 00:30:16,730
Right, Susie Q.

717
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:18,323
Thanks, Assface.

718
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:19,391
Oh, one more thing.

719
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,095
I negotiated a 30% discount

720
00:30:21,136 --> 00:30:22,433
at the gym
across the street.

721
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:26,032
Our HMO
offers an additional 60%.

722
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,042
That leaves you
with only $10 a month to pay.

723
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,509
See Donna for the paperwork.

724
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:31,375
I expect
to see some of you there.

725
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:36,450
Thanks.
This was a great meeting.

726
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:37,782
Thanks, guys.

727
00:30:38,987 --> 00:30:40,818
Right, right.

728
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:47,657
- Weren't you
a little hard on Doug?

729
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:49,163
Who?

730
00:30:49,197 --> 00:30:50,892
- Assface.
- No.

731
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,992
What's he thinking,
calling me Susie Q?

732
00:30:54,036 --> 00:30:57,164
He didn't give your old boss
any cute nicknames, did he?

733
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:58,229
But you guys, you...

734
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,365
Drop it.

735
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:14,014
- Did you go
to the Volvo dealership?

736
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:17,685
- Yeah,
I went for a test-drive.

737
00:31:17,726 --> 00:31:18,920
We need a new car.

738
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,948
Ours keeps breaking down.

739
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:21,393
And besides,
I feel like such a loser

740
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:23,329
when I drop Henry off
in my crappy car.

741
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:24,991
- I thought you hate
all the moms at school

742
00:31:25,032 --> 00:31:26,693
with their 4x4s.

743
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:30,033
- I do,
but Volvos are different.

744
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:31,538
Well, it's a hefty sum.

745
00:31:31,572 --> 00:31:33,005
- Yeah, but look at...
for the lease.

746
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,439
- Well, that's what
I'm looking at.

747
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,909
I thought
we'd pay off our mortgage.

748
00:31:36,944 --> 00:31:38,878
It was just an idea.

749
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:40,881
It's so nice
not to have to worry

750
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:43,042
about money so much.

751
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:44,881
- We have to pay off
our credit cards.

752
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:46,045
Uh-uh.

753
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:47,952
I refinanced them.

754
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:49,615
Because
of your new income level,

755
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,454
we qualify
for a no-fee account,

756
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,289
so I got us a new card,

757
00:31:53,327 --> 00:31:55,989
and I transferred
all the old ones onto that one,

758
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,022
and we get 0%
for three months.

759
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,228
- I'm gonna set my alarm
for 4:30.

760
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,397
I have so much work to do,
it's not even funny.

761
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:07,236
So I guess

762
00:32:07,274 --> 00:32:09,572
you don't want to get
all tired out.

763
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,942
- Mm-mm, I got to read
all this stuff.

764
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:17,080
I stopped taking the pill.

765
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:20,485
What do you think?

766
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,149
- I think I don't have much say
in the matter.

767
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,551
Don't blame me later.

768
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:30,594
Mm.

769
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:34,594
Mommy!

770
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:38,501
Oh, what's wrong, buddy?

771
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,234
This is hot.

772
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:42,434
Do you have a fever?

773
00:32:44,144 --> 00:32:45,236
I'm sorry, buddy.

774
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:46,575
I'm gonna go get you
some Tylenol.

775
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:48,308
I'll be right back.

776
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:56,785
- Hi.
- Hi.

777
00:32:56,823 --> 00:32:59,621
Oh, are those anthuriums?

778
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:01,126
Uh...

779
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,193
Yeah.

780
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:07,756
Todd, hi.

781
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,858
Pete Cozy.

782
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:10,062
Pete, face to name.

783
00:33:10,103 --> 00:33:11,832
Can I get you a coffee?

784
00:33:11,871 --> 00:33:14,169
- No, I'm set, thanks.
- Great.

785
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:15,674
This place is great.

786
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:18,643
You guy are doing a great job
keeping a low profile.

787
00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:20,805
- Yeah.
Thanks.

788
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:23,042
- I'd like to check out
the computers before we start.

789
00:33:23,082 --> 00:33:24,549
- Okay,
I set you up in my office.

790
00:33:24,584 --> 00:33:25,881
Please.
- Great.

791
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,409
Here's a hard copy
of my itinerary.

792
00:33:27,453 --> 00:33:28,579
It's gonna be tight,

793
00:33:28,621 --> 00:33:30,111
but I've got
a 3:30 flight tomorrow

794
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:31,555
that I've got to catch.

795
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:33,991
I'm speaking at UCLA,
and then I'm off to Japan.

796
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:35,551
And if I don't fit in
some family time,

797
00:33:35,595 --> 00:33:37,153
my wife will kill me,
you know what I mean?

798
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:38,255
Yeah.

799
00:33:38,298 --> 00:33:40,129
I was up all night
with a sick kid.

800
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,292
Oh, I know what it's like.

801
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:43,564
Last year,
I took my kids down the Amazon.

802
00:33:43,603 --> 00:33:45,070
One of 'em came back
with a tapeworm.

803
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:46,571
I didn't sleep for a week.

804
00:33:46,606 --> 00:33:50,406
This is perfect.

805
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:51,910
I think
you're gonna be very excited

806
00:33:51,945 --> 00:33:53,242
with what we've put together.

807
00:33:54,714 --> 00:33:57,148
Slater's was trying to compete
against the superstores

808
00:33:57,183 --> 00:33:58,707
using EDLP modeling.

809
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:01,049
And of course,
you can't compete with that.

810
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:02,884
It's the same with Wolski's.

811
00:34:02,922 --> 00:34:04,889
You can't beat them on price
every time

812
00:34:04,923 --> 00:34:06,823
or go chasing
their specials pricing.

813
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:09,827
Wolski's needs something new
to compete.

814
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:13,297
What we're proposing
is predictive analysis

815
00:34:13,332 --> 00:34:15,061
at a level unheard of
in this industry.

816
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,795
- This is what we were pushing
at Slater's,

817
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:18,029
but they just wouldn't listen.

818
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,367
- Well, to be fair,
this industry

819
00:34:19,404 --> 00:34:22,032
seems particularly slow
to adapt to new trends,

820
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:23,564
but there
are big opportunities here.

821
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:24,906
Susan wanted big ideas.

822
00:34:24,943 --> 00:34:26,570
- All right,
just so I can find some way

823
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:28,375
to translate all of this:

824
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:30,711
What we're seeing is,
we're better off

825
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:32,717
choosing select products
for big discounts

826
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:34,150
rather than
the hybrid incentives

827
00:34:34,186 --> 00:34:35,175
we're using right now.

828
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,949
Correct.

829
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:39,583
And the key
is which products we select.

830
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,252
We're not just
selling the product.

831
00:34:41,293 --> 00:34:43,591
We are selling our image.

832
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:46,154
Each featured product
will announce to the customer

833
00:34:46,198 --> 00:34:49,133
who we are,
what makes us special,

834
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:52,159
not just the product
but the kind of products.

835
00:34:52,204 --> 00:34:54,764
We're not offering
special prices.

836
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:57,502
We are offering...

837
00:34:57,542 --> 00:35:00,807
specialness.

838
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:02,279
- What about
our other competitors?

839
00:35:02,314 --> 00:35:04,282
Did you get a chance
to review their strategies?

840
00:35:04,316 --> 00:35:05,613
Well, as far as we can tell,

841
00:35:05,651 --> 00:35:07,710
none of the other shops
are doing anything like this.

842
00:35:07,753 --> 00:35:09,380
It's very exciting.

843
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:10,718
But there's a big qualifier.

844
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:12,451
It's all comes down
to implementation.

845
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:13,924
If you could
put all these strategies

846
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:15,085
into your stores tomorrow,

847
00:35:15,127 --> 00:35:16,560
we'd be two years
ahead of everybody,

848
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:18,290
but realistically,
I know how long it takes

849
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,423
to work these things
through the chain.

850
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:22,490
Once the strategies
start to go into your stores,

851
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:23,933
your competitors
are gonna notice.

852
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:26,403
- So after two years,
there's almost no advantage.

853
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:29,372
There's a declining function.

854
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:32,308
But when these strategies
go into your stores,

855
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:34,743
your market share
will grow 8% to 10%

856
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:35,768
within three months.

857
00:35:35,813 --> 00:35:37,872
- 8% to 10%?
- Wow.

858
00:35:37,915 --> 00:35:40,713
- After time,
these numbers decline steeply.

859
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:43,481
Stealing ideas is what passes
for R&D in this business.

860
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:46,354
- So has ACS spoken
to the vendors about all this?

861
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,755
Pete, shh.

862
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:48,781
I'm sorry.

863
00:35:48,826 --> 00:35:50,487
I thought ACS was behind you
on this.

864
00:35:52,363 --> 00:35:54,160
It's complicated.

865
00:35:54,198 --> 00:35:56,291
- You're so happy
to go to work these days.

866
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:57,323
- I know.
I just...

867
00:35:57,368 --> 00:35:59,029
I feel better about it now,

868
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,039
like what I'm doing
might actually have some value.

869
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:04,041
Pricing groceries?

870
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:06,543
- I joined the gym
near the office,

871
00:36:06,577 --> 00:36:08,340
thought I'd start going
during lunch.

872
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:09,710
Got you a membership too.

873
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:12,544
I'm getting fat, huh?

874
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:14,346
- No.
It was only 10 bucks.

875
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:16,182
- When am I gonna have a chance
to go to the gym?

876
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,244
You just got to make time.

877
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:19,415
Susan goes
at 5:00 in the morning.

878
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:21,516
Susan doesn't have kids.

879
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,186
You're kidding me!

880
00:36:23,227 --> 00:36:24,990
That Cartwright!

881
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:27,497
Jesus Christ!

882
00:36:27,531 --> 00:36:29,556
Pete Cozy!

883
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,363
Jesus Christ!

884
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:33,097
Someone from ACS
got wind that we were using

885
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,832
Slater's strategies
from Intellichoice.

886
00:36:34,872 --> 00:36:37,340
I don't know how, but now
they want to sideline us.

887
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,240
They want us to try out
our strategies

888
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:42,211
at one of their stores
and see how they fly.

889
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:44,077
- Isn't that normal,
to see how things work out?

890
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:45,742
Fuck that!

891
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:48,251
No, I'm not gonna sit around
and let Stop & Shop

892
00:36:48,285 --> 00:36:50,081
decide if our experiment
works for them.

893
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,611
What's the fucking point
of that?

894
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:55,453
Take what we have, go home,
and pack a bag.

895
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:58,284
We'll figure something out
on the plane.

896
00:36:58,328 --> 00:36:59,317
Donna?

897
00:36:59,362 --> 00:37:00,556
Bennington will get this.

898
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:01,723
Bennington, the CEO?

899
00:37:01,765 --> 00:37:03,255
Yeah, who else?

900
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:05,426
- Where is that suit,
the one I wore to Jim's wedding?

901
00:37:05,468 --> 00:37:07,459
- I don't think
it's gonna fit you.

902
00:37:07,504 --> 00:37:09,904
- Can you just help me
find it?

903
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:11,964
- How come your old boss
never took you to L. A?

904
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:13,908
- I don't know.
I wasn't a VP then, I guess.

905
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:28,651
I mean, 8% to 10%,
how can they say no to that?

906
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:30,318
The problem is,
these supermarket guys

907
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,520
are all Luddites.

908
00:37:31,561 --> 00:37:33,324
They all grew up
in the supermarket business.

909
00:37:33,363 --> 00:37:34,660
I know who's blocking us too.

910
00:37:34,697 --> 00:37:35,755
It's Cartwright.

911
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:36,959
Who's he?

912
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,524
- CFO,
best friends with D'asarlo,

913
00:37:38,568 --> 00:37:39,967
my boss at Slater's.

914
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:42,198
They used to give each other
hand jobs at the country club

915
00:37:42,238 --> 00:37:45,002
while I was trying
to turn around their company.

916
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:46,531
Assholes.

917
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:11,164
Morning.

918
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,260
- Is that the only suit
you brought?

919
00:38:14,303 --> 00:38:15,361
Yes.

920
00:38:15,404 --> 00:38:16,894
Oh, my God.

921
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,732
Donna?

922
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:21,208
Uh, call Brioni
in Beverly Hills

923
00:38:21,243 --> 00:38:23,234
and see what time
they open.

924
00:38:23,278 --> 00:38:25,542
And try Bernini too.

925
00:38:25,581 --> 00:38:26,639
10:00?

926
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:28,047
What about Brooks Brothers?

927
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,141
I don't know.

928
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:30,617
Fuck!

929
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:38,925
Where'd you get that suit,
anyway?

930
00:38:38,961 --> 00:38:40,485
Did you think
we were going to a wedding?

931
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:43,157
It's the only one I have.

932
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:44,825
I don't know about you.

933
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,596
Just...

934
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:51,997
- Stand behind a planter
or something.

935
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,531
- He'll see you now,
Miss Felders.

936
00:38:58,013 --> 00:39:00,743
- You understood that we were
gonna try this out gradually.

937
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:03,046
- You gave me the authority
to do this.

938
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:04,552
- I know,
but it's complicated.

939
00:39:04,586 --> 00:39:05,712
Maybe I can get the board

940
00:39:05,754 --> 00:39:07,551
to put it in
a couple of more stores.

941
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:08,715
No!

942
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:09,985
You've seen these numbers.

943
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:11,583
It's all or none.

944
00:39:11,627 --> 00:39:13,424
- Well, now, that's not
going to happen, Susan.

945
00:39:13,462 --> 00:39:14,429
Be realistic.

946
00:39:14,463 --> 00:39:16,556
Why did you hire me!

947
00:39:16,598 --> 00:39:21,592
Why did you give me
this fucking job!

948
00:39:21,637 --> 00:39:23,605
Why did you hire me!

949
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:26,733
8% to 10% increase in sales!

950
00:39:26,775 --> 00:39:28,106
Calm down, Susan.

951
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:30,236
- No.
I'm not calming down, Jack.

952
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:32,713
This has to go
in all our stores,

953
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:34,339
or I quit.

954
00:39:34,382 --> 00:39:36,009
- This is a major operation.
L...

955
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,348
And it doesn't help that
you're stealing Slater's ideas.

956
00:39:38,386 --> 00:39:40,684
They threw 'em away.

957
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:43,315
- I can't do it
without the board's approval.

958
00:39:43,357 --> 00:39:45,086
- Okay, fine,
then let's go to the board.

959
00:39:45,126 --> 00:39:46,184
Just let them hear our case.

960
00:39:46,227 --> 00:39:47,717
- Well, at the monthly meeting,
I'll...

961
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:49,696
- When's that?
- Next month.

962
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,856
No way.

963
00:39:50,898 --> 00:39:52,695
- I can't just summon the board,
chop-chop.

964
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:54,223
Yes, you can.

965
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,498
When Ralphs made that
takeover bid last October,

966
00:39:56,537 --> 00:39:58,471
the board met that afternoon.

967
00:39:58,506 --> 00:40:00,371
Come on, Jack.

968
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:01,432
Work with me on this.

969
00:40:01,475 --> 00:40:02,464
I...

970
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,568
There's no reason to wait.

971
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:05,943
These strategies
are time-sensitive.

972
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,005
We're losing money.

973
00:40:08,049 --> 00:40:11,746
8% to 10% increase in sales
in three months.

974
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,151
Yeah, if it works.

975
00:40:13,187 --> 00:40:14,484
- Well, we have to do
something.

976
00:40:14,522 --> 00:40:15,887
What are you gonna do?

977
00:40:15,923 --> 00:40:18,084
Are you gonna go in front
of the shareholders in October

978
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,717
with Slater's plan of EDLP?

979
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,091
That's just...

980
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:24,120
- And 2% growth rate targets
that he'll miss again?

981
00:40:24,165 --> 00:40:26,895
Come on, Jack,
you knew what I was doing.

982
00:40:26,934 --> 00:40:30,199
And I know you want to try this,
so what's stopping you?

983
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:36,174
All right, I will try
to get a board meeting together

984
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,234
for tomorrow.

985
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:38,768
I will help you with this,

986
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:41,577
but you,
you have to sell them on this.

987
00:40:41,616 --> 00:40:42,640
Yes.

988
00:40:42,683 --> 00:40:44,207
Yes?

989
00:40:44,251 --> 00:40:45,582
Thank you.

990
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:53,793
We have to get you
another suit.

991
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:55,488
You cannot go to the board
in that.

992
00:40:57,464 --> 00:40:59,295
And a haircut.

993
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,424
So what do you think?

994
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:01,627
It's fucking great.

995
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:02,794
Here, try these on.

996
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:04,064
It's $5,000.

997
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:05,594
- Yeah,
lucky you got a raise, huh?

998
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,607
- We can have the alterations
done this afternoon.

999
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:09,609
$6,000?

1000
00:41:09,643 --> 00:41:12,578
- Almost $7,000,
and $300 for a haircut.

1001
00:41:14,147 --> 00:41:15,409
How's it look?

1002
00:41:15,448 --> 00:41:17,643
- I don't know.
I think it looks a little gay.

1003
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:22,748
Maybe that's a good thing.

1004
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:25,383
I don't want any girls
looking at you in L.A.

1005
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:27,086
- Well, you don't have to worry
about that.

1006
00:41:27,127 --> 00:41:28,492
I've been so busy,

1007
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:31,156
I haven't even had time
to go for a swim in the pool.

1008
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,358
Good luck tomorrow.

1009
00:41:34,668 --> 00:41:35,999
I love you.

1010
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,656
- This is the difference between
retiring on a golf course

1011
00:41:58,692 --> 00:42:01,252
in the Bahamas
with your own pool and boat

1012
00:42:01,294 --> 00:42:04,161
or, you know, getting bought
out of a reverse mortgage

1013
00:42:04,197 --> 00:42:05,892
because you can't afford
to pay the doctor

1014
00:42:05,932 --> 00:42:07,263
to get your prostate removed.

1015
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,996
I'll do most of the talking.
You sell the numbers.

1016
00:42:10,036 --> 00:42:12,402
I make the case.
You back it up.

1017
00:42:12,439 --> 00:42:15,408
- These strategies
were paid for by Slater's.

1018
00:42:15,442 --> 00:42:17,739
They were the property
of Slater's.

1019
00:42:17,776 --> 00:42:19,835
- I thought
we were all working for ACS.

1020
00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:21,846
Slater's is a banner under ACS
just like Wolski's.

1021
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,507
They don't compete
against each other.

1022
00:42:23,549 --> 00:42:25,574
They aren't even
in the same part of the country.

1023
00:42:25,617 --> 00:42:27,642
I mean, what's good for Slater's
is good for Wolski's

1024
00:42:27,686 --> 00:42:29,051
is good for ACS.

1025
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,056
- These strategies
weren't any good for Slater's.

1026
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,785
- They may not have been great
for Slater's,

1027
00:42:32,825 --> 00:42:34,053
but Wolski's is losing money,

1028
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,617
and we have to do something
about that.

1029
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:37,959
- I don't understand how
you could afford Intellichoice

1030
00:42:37,996 --> 00:42:39,930
with the consulting budget
that you have.

1031
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:42,456
- To tell you the truth,
I had to make some cuts.

1032
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:45,197
- Yes, yes, cuts...
Tony Gomes.

1033
00:42:45,237 --> 00:42:48,365
12 years at Wolski's, and you...
you just threw him away.

1034
00:42:48,407 --> 00:42:49,567
He was slacking.

1035
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,007
- Yeah, well,
that's funny,

1036
00:42:51,043 --> 00:42:52,977
'cause I can't find
a single thing in the reports

1037
00:42:53,011 --> 00:42:54,171
saying that he was slacking.

1038
00:42:54,213 --> 00:42:55,578
He had seniority.

1039
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:59,209
- He was making three times
what his peers were making.

1040
00:42:59,251 --> 00:43:01,811
Was he worth three times
one of them?

1041
00:43:01,854 --> 00:43:03,082
No.

1042
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,683
Intellichoice has given us
some solid strategies

1043
00:43:06,725 --> 00:43:09,455
that we can start putting
in our stores in January.

1044
00:43:09,495 --> 00:43:10,723
January?

1045
00:43:10,763 --> 00:43:12,060
At the managers' convention?

1046
00:43:12,097 --> 00:43:13,086
Exactly.

1047
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,497
- In five weeks?
- Yeah.

1048
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:17,525
- How are you gonna translate
these statistical models

1049
00:43:17,569 --> 00:43:20,800
into strategies
the managers will understand

1050
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:22,170
in five weeks?

1051
00:43:22,207 --> 00:43:24,198
Well, uh, the statistics...

1052
00:43:24,243 --> 00:43:27,235
- Excuse me, uh, Susan,
if I may.

1053
00:43:30,749 --> 00:43:35,209
First of all, the HP9726,
the scanning system

1054
00:43:35,254 --> 00:43:37,017
we put in all our stores
last year,

1055
00:43:37,055 --> 00:43:39,887
can handle this
behind the scenes.

1056
00:43:39,924 --> 00:43:41,755
- You have to retrain
the checkout people?

1057
00:43:41,793 --> 00:43:43,420
- No, no,
well, uh, the managers

1058
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:44,894
will need a little bit
of training,

1059
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:46,396
but that's mostly
just to understand

1060
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,522
why we're doing this.

1061
00:43:47,565 --> 00:43:49,226
They already know
how to do these things.

1062
00:43:49,267 --> 00:43:51,667
The rest
is just shelving strategies

1063
00:43:51,702 --> 00:43:52,999
and scanning feedback,
really.

1064
00:43:53,037 --> 00:43:54,595
On steroids.

1065
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:56,231
- When are we gonna see
the results from this?

1066
00:43:56,274 --> 00:43:59,107
- Intellichoice indicates
an 8% to 10% increase in sales

1067
00:43:59,143 --> 00:44:00,337
in three months.

1068
00:44:00,378 --> 00:44:02,676
Three months!

1069
00:44:02,713 --> 00:44:04,613
I mean, the only time
we see results like that

1070
00:44:04,649 --> 00:44:06,776
is when a Walmart opens
near one of our stores,

1071
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:08,149
and then the results are bad.

1072
00:44:08,186 --> 00:44:09,653
- I just don't see
how you can do it.

1073
00:44:09,687 --> 00:44:11,985
No, personally, I mean,
that department you're running,

1074
00:44:12,023 --> 00:44:13,320
it doesn't have the people;

1075
00:44:13,357 --> 00:44:14,517
it doesn't have the expertise

1076
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:16,117
to put that kind of plan
into action.

1077
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,821
- The only thing wrong
with that department

1078
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:19,386
was the leadership
that it was getting.

1079
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,456
- Jim Grady
was an excellent manager,

1080
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,695
and he was a personal friend
of mine.

1081
00:44:24,735 --> 00:44:27,829
- I've been in this business
my entire life,

1082
00:44:27,872 --> 00:44:32,900
and I've never seen a department
come together like this.

1083
00:44:32,944 --> 00:44:34,707
They were just waiting
for something

1084
00:44:34,745 --> 00:44:36,269
to get excited about!

1085
00:44:36,314 --> 00:44:38,111
Okay, Susan, Pete,

1086
00:44:38,149 --> 00:44:39,514
we've heard
what you have to say,

1087
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:40,881
and we'll let you know.

1088
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:48,516
- Mr. Cozy, Mr. Bennington
would like to see you alone.

1089
00:44:55,733 --> 00:44:57,598
- Pete Cozy,
I wanted to meet you personally

1090
00:44:57,635 --> 00:44:59,068
before you
went back to New York.

1091
00:44:59,103 --> 00:45:01,571
Now, I know you're focused
on this project right now,

1092
00:45:01,606 --> 00:45:04,233
but when it's done,
I'd like to sit down

1093
00:45:04,274 --> 00:45:06,333
and have a chat,
maybe dinner.

1094
00:45:06,376 --> 00:45:10,710
Susan says that
you went to Dartmouth.

1095
00:45:10,747 --> 00:45:11,873
I have a daughter at Columbia.

1096
00:45:11,915 --> 00:45:13,007
Oh.

1097
00:45:13,049 --> 00:45:16,507
- Education is the most
important thing in life.

1098
00:45:16,553 --> 00:45:18,851
You can have all the experience
in the world,

1099
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:20,857
but without the foundation
of an education,

1100
00:45:20,891 --> 00:45:23,052
it just doesn't amount
to much.

1101
00:45:23,093 --> 00:45:27,359
- "Genius without education
is like silver in the mine. "

1102
00:45:27,397 --> 00:45:29,024
Indeed.

1103
00:45:29,065 --> 00:45:30,396
You're a family man,
aren't you?

1104
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:31,525
Yes.

1105
00:45:31,568 --> 00:45:34,696
- Happiest years of my life,
raising my kids.

1106
00:45:34,738 --> 00:45:37,036
Great.

1107
00:45:37,073 --> 00:45:38,199
I've always believed that

1108
00:45:38,241 --> 00:45:39,868
if you surround yourself
with the best people,

1109
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,673
they force you to play
at the top of your game.

1110
00:45:41,711 --> 00:45:44,305
But Susan is a piece of work.

1111
00:45:44,347 --> 00:45:47,282
She was driving everyone crazy
at Slater's.

1112
00:45:47,317 --> 00:45:49,785
If I approve these strategies
of yours,

1113
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:51,980
I'm gonna make
some important people angry.

1114
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,914
Can your people
back in Long Island

1115
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:59,156
really get this done
in five weeks?

1116
00:45:59,195 --> 00:46:01,720
- Susan can get anything done,
sir.

1117
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,925
I'm asking you.

1118
00:46:06,603 --> 00:46:07,934
Um...

1119
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:12,006
I believe
we can get it done.

1120
00:46:15,312 --> 00:46:17,610
- You're a good man, Pete,
honest.

1121
00:46:17,647 --> 00:46:19,615
I like that.

1122
00:46:19,649 --> 00:46:21,913
I'll stay in touch.

1123
00:46:21,952 --> 00:46:23,783
Send Miss Felders in.

1124
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:26,684
Classic.

1125
00:46:26,722 --> 00:46:29,520
- Susan,
the board was...

1126
00:46:29,558 --> 00:46:31,458
mostly willing
to go along.

1127
00:46:31,493 --> 00:46:34,326
Now, you only have five weeks
to get this set up,

1128
00:46:34,363 --> 00:46:38,493
so I guess
you better keep going.

1129
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:40,661
- No, I think he was talking
about giving me a job.

1130
00:46:40,703 --> 00:46:41,897
Higher than vice president?

1131
00:46:41,937 --> 00:46:42,926
I don't know.

1132
00:46:42,972 --> 00:46:43,961
President?

1133
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:47,667
Oh, Susan's here.
I got to go.

1134
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:48,802
I love you.

1135
00:46:48,844 --> 00:46:51,108
Love you too.

1136
00:46:51,146 --> 00:46:52,511
Hi.

1137
00:46:52,548 --> 00:46:53,879
I'm going out
with some friends.

1138
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:55,110
Do you want to come?

1139
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,708
What did Bennington say
to you?

1140
00:46:56,752 --> 00:46:58,879
- Well, he said that when
we're done with this project,

1141
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:00,047
he wants to talk to me.

1142
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:01,647
- Yeah, when these strategies
come out,

1143
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,749
the headhunters
are gonna be all over you.

1144
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:05,089
He wants to get you
under contract

1145
00:47:05,127 --> 00:47:06,219
before that happens.

1146
00:47:09,164 --> 00:47:12,133
Janis, Jake,

1147
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:14,101
this is Pete.

1148
00:47:14,136 --> 00:47:15,433
Hi, I'm Janis.

1149
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:18,099
- He's the only cool guy
in the office, so be nice.

1150
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,301
Hey, honey.
- Hey.

1151
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:22,970
- You should see this place
they call Long Island.

1152
00:47:23,012 --> 00:47:24,912
It's totally nowheresville.

1153
00:47:24,947 --> 00:47:26,209
It's like the Valley,

1154
00:47:26,248 --> 00:47:28,716
but the people
are pale and yucky.

1155
00:47:28,751 --> 00:47:31,777
The only place to eat
is Friday's.

1156
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,185
The people are so unhealthy.

1157
00:47:33,222 --> 00:47:34,484
So what do you do?

1158
00:47:34,523 --> 00:47:35,547
I'm an artist.

1159
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:36,580
She runs a website.

1160
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:39,025
Just to pay the bills.

1161
00:47:39,061 --> 00:47:40,653
Did you always work
in supermarkets?

1162
00:47:40,696 --> 00:47:42,323
Oh, no, no way.

1163
00:47:42,364 --> 00:47:44,025
I was working for this guy
in New York,

1164
00:47:44,066 --> 00:47:45,693
running his record label.

1165
00:47:45,734 --> 00:47:48,964
That fell apart,
so I needed another job.

1166
00:47:49,003 --> 00:47:50,265
I know how it is.

1167
00:47:50,304 --> 00:47:52,101
- But I'm not planning
on doing that forever.

1168
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,198
Oh, yeah?

1169
00:47:53,241 --> 00:47:54,731
What are you gonna be doing,
Pete?

1170
00:47:54,776 --> 00:47:57,472
- Well, I'd like to try and get
back into the music business.

1171
00:47:57,512 --> 00:48:01,744
- Haven't you noticed
that the music industry is dead?

1172
00:48:01,783 --> 00:48:02,875
Maybe at an indie label.

1173
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:04,009
It's dead.

1174
00:48:04,052 --> 00:48:05,644
Okay, it's dead.

1175
00:48:05,686 --> 00:48:07,244
- I mean, how are you
gonna support Henry

1176
00:48:07,288 --> 00:48:08,277
running an indie label?

1177
00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:09,584
Pete's got the cutest kid.

1178
00:48:09,624 --> 00:48:11,854
Show 'em a picture.

1179
00:48:11,893 --> 00:48:13,986
- Ah, you don't want to see
a picture.

1180
00:48:14,028 --> 00:48:15,893
- Yeah.
- Come on, yeah.

1181
00:48:18,866 --> 00:48:20,424
- Aww.
- Look at him.

1182
00:48:20,468 --> 00:48:22,197
Is that your wife?

1183
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:23,260
Ah, yep.

1184
00:48:23,304 --> 00:48:25,135
She's pretty.

1185
00:48:25,173 --> 00:48:26,333
Oh, shit.

1186
00:48:26,374 --> 00:48:27,773
I heard you were in town.

1187
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:29,276
- What are you doing here,
Ernie?

1188
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:30,607
I come here all the time.

1189
00:48:30,645 --> 00:48:31,976
What are you doing here?

1190
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:37,373
So can I buy you a drink,
you know, for old time's sake?

1191
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:39,147
Uh, no.

1192
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:41,243
How old is she?

1193
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:44,190
She's young, okay?

1194
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:45,317
It doesn't mean anything.

1195
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:46,792
Is she your girlfriend?

1196
00:48:46,828 --> 00:48:47,954
Mm-mm.

1197
00:48:47,995 --> 00:48:49,053
Well, yeah, yeah.

1198
00:48:49,097 --> 00:48:51,463
We're seeing each other.

1199
00:48:52,567 --> 00:48:55,058
Listen, can I...
can we just...

1200
00:48:55,103 --> 00:48:57,128
can we talk outside
for a minute?

1201
00:48:57,171 --> 00:48:58,160
- No.
- Yes.

1202
00:48:58,206 --> 00:48:59,696
- No way.
- Come on.

1203
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,436
Come on, what the...
what the fuck is your problem?

1204
00:49:02,477 --> 00:49:03,637
- Hey, Ernie,
leave her alone.

1205
00:49:03,678 --> 00:49:04,702
Yeah, get over it already.

1206
00:49:04,745 --> 00:49:05,871
Okay, you know what?

1207
00:49:05,913 --> 00:49:08,211
You guys know one side
of this story, okay?

1208
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:09,476
She lies.

1209
00:49:09,516 --> 00:49:10,778
You lie.

1210
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:12,785
You say one thing to my face.
You tell me you love me.

1211
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:14,810
And then you tell everyone else
that I'm an asshole.

1212
00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:16,413
You are an asshole.

1213
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:18,287
- Hey, you know what?
Just come outside with me.

1214
00:49:18,325 --> 00:49:19,314
Come on.
- Ah, Jesus.

1215
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,486
- Why don't you
leave her alone?

1216
00:49:21,528 --> 00:49:22,654
Who the fuck are you?

1217
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:24,789
He's my new boyfriend.

1218
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:26,492
- Really?
- Yeah.

1219
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:31,367
- She give you crabs?
'Cause she gave me crabs.

1220
00:49:31,404 --> 00:49:32,496
I did not give you crabs.

1221
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:33,733
You gave me crabs!

1222
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:36,071
Jesus Christ!
Fuck you!

1223
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:37,235
You know what?

1224
00:49:37,277 --> 00:49:39,370
I know...
I know you still love me.

1225
00:49:39,412 --> 00:49:40,538
I do.

1226
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,275
Oh, and your boyfriend
looks like a fag.

1227
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:45,747
Ugh, so sorry about that.

1228
00:49:45,785 --> 00:49:47,776
Jesus Christ.

1229
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:53,985
Number 12, you said?

1230
00:49:54,027 --> 00:49:55,255
- Can you give me,
like, five...

1231
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:56,353
- What...
Ernie, oh, my God.

1232
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:57,385
Get off her!

1233
00:49:58,565 --> 00:49:59,964
Oh, my nose!

1234
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,524
You fucking dick!

1235
00:50:11,778 --> 00:50:16,078
# You are the treacle
in my pie #

1236
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:20,177
# You are the splinter
in my eye #

1237
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,816
# You make the ice melt,
the butter run #

1238
00:50:24,858 --> 00:50:29,022
# You make the ink stain,
you are the one #

1239
00:50:29,062 --> 00:50:33,361
# Sleep together,
the Milky Way #

1240
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:37,836
# Sleep forever and a day #

1241
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:42,637
# Lovely jewels
in joy designed #

1242
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:45,337
# La, la, la, la #

1243
00:50:55,754 --> 00:50:58,416
- Don't sleep with her,
or I'll tell Sara.

1244
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:06,224
# I am the local #

1245
00:51:06,265 --> 00:51:07,323
# I am express #

1246
00:51:07,366 --> 00:51:08,560
Whoo!

1247
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:11,764
# I am a tourist
in a summer dress #

1248
00:51:11,804 --> 00:51:13,169
Ow!

1249
00:51:13,205 --> 00:51:17,266
# I am the night nurse,
I am the most #

1250
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:21,143
# I am the visitor,
you are the host #

1251
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:26,015
# Sleep together,
the Milky Way #

1252
00:51:26,051 --> 00:51:30,351
# Sleep forever and a day #

1253
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:34,985
# Lovely jewels
in joy designed #

1254
00:51:35,027 --> 00:51:36,790
# La, la, la, la #

1255
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:37,921
It's last call.

1256
00:51:37,963 --> 00:51:40,693
No way.

1257
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:41,825
It's getting late.

1258
00:51:41,867 --> 00:51:43,562
- Well, we can raid the minibar
after this.

1259
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:45,365
- Oh, come on.
I don't know.

1260
00:51:45,404 --> 00:51:48,703
- Oh, don't bag on me now,
Pete.

1261
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:52,370
You're such a good guy...

1262
00:51:52,411 --> 00:51:54,139
Mm-hmm.

1263
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:55,202
Such a nice guy.

1264
00:51:55,246 --> 00:51:57,544
Right.

1265
00:51:57,582 --> 00:51:59,550
- Why don't I ever meet
nice guys like you?

1266
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:01,245
What are you talking about?

1267
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:05,415
You met me.

1268
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,616
Yeah, I met you.

1269
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,954
- Why don't you come upstairs
and impregnate me?

1270
00:52:17,335 --> 00:52:20,168
You're not serious.

1271
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:22,570
Yeah, I am.

1272
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,407
Well, you're drunk.

1273
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:28,912
So what if I am?

1274
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:33,110
# A plateful of promise,
a spoonful of... #

1275
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,051
- You know, I don't even
find you that attractive.

1276
00:52:35,086 --> 00:52:36,713
That's the weird thing.
- I know.

1277
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:39,245
But you're such a good guy.

1278
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:43,093
You've got good genes.

1279
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:45,118
You're a good father.

1280
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,862
Your sperm works.

1281
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,396
I'm tired of this stupid job
being my life.

1282
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:58,598
I want to have a baby.

1283
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:03,980
Come on.

1284
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:07,143
You don't have to have anything
to do with it.

1285
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:09,176
I won't tell Sara.

1286
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:12,283
I just want your seed.

1287
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:14,848
# La, la, la, la #

1288
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:16,620
# La, la, la-la, la-la #

1289
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,561
No one will ever know.

1290
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,427
I'll move back to L.A.

1291
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,095
I just want to be a mother.

1292
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,570
- You've given this
a lot of thought.

1293
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:38,547
# Brush me,
divide me in two #

1294
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,516
# Drink me and drown me #

1295
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,984
- I'm not unattractive,
am I?

1296
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,318
It's not like
you never thought about it.

1297
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:48,017
Don't do that.

1298
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,356
You're not crazy.

1299
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,286
You're cool.

1300
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,629
You like good music.

1301
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:57,963
You're smart.

1302
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,798
- Don't say I went to Dartmouth,
please.

1303
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,827
You went to Dartmouth.

1304
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,469
Come on.

1305
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:09,172
I want a baby.

1306
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,912
You know
I always get what I want.

1307
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:15,645
# La, la, la-la, la-la #

1308
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,210
# La, la, la, la #

1309
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,985
# La, la, la-la, la-la #

1310
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,151
# La, la, la, la-la #

1311
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:26,128
# La, la, la, la-la, la-la #

1312
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:24,013
Oh, we're home.

1313
00:55:25,688 --> 00:55:27,849
You can't come in.

1314
00:55:29,124 --> 00:55:31,251
Yep.

1315
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:32,760
Open the door.

1316
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:34,285
Thank you.

1317
00:55:40,703 --> 00:55:42,000
Oh, I envy you.

1318
00:55:42,037 --> 00:55:43,061
Look at that.

1319
00:55:43,105 --> 00:55:44,595
And she's pretty too.

1320
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,107
Man, you're a bad boy.

1321
00:55:47,643 --> 00:55:48,735
Wow, thanks!

1322
00:55:50,846 --> 00:55:52,177
Mmm.

1323
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:55,946
You smell like perfume.
- I know.

1324
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,044
Susan hugged me at the airport.
She was covered in it.

1325
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:01,121
I missed you.
- I missed you too.

1326
00:56:01,155 --> 00:56:03,715
- I can't believe how great
your job is going.

1327
00:56:03,758 --> 00:56:05,453
I mean, moving to L. A?

1328
00:56:05,493 --> 00:56:07,324
God, that would be so sweet.

1329
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:14,066
Oh.

1330
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,381
# Oh, her eyes appear #

1331
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:31,681
# And it always is #

1332
00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:36,254
# And it always is again #

1333
00:56:40,395 --> 00:56:46,129
# Oh #

1334
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:48,294
# Oh #

1335
00:56:51,072 --> 00:56:55,372
# Oh #

1336
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:56,968
- Hey.
- Hey, nice haircut.

1337
00:56:57,011 --> 00:57:00,174
Hey, you too.

1338
00:57:00,214 --> 00:57:01,738
Hi, everybody.

1339
00:57:01,783 --> 00:57:04,047
You will all be pleased to hear,
I've gotten authorization

1340
00:57:04,085 --> 00:57:06,144
to double
your Christmas bonuses.

1341
00:57:07,655 --> 00:57:09,179
- Whoo!
- That's what I'm talking about.

1342
00:57:09,223 --> 00:57:11,350
- You're gonna have to work hard
for this money, though.

1343
00:57:11,392 --> 00:57:13,883
The January manager's convention
is in five weeks.

1344
00:57:13,928 --> 00:57:14,952
Whoa, whoa.

1345
00:57:14,996 --> 00:57:16,588
Five weeks?
- What?

1346
00:57:16,631 --> 00:57:18,622
- I know
it's not a lot of time.

1347
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,600
- Yeah, no,
it's literally impossible.

1348
00:57:20,635 --> 00:57:21,795
Don't say that.

1349
00:57:21,836 --> 00:57:23,803
Jack Bennington
has taken a personal interest

1350
00:57:23,837 --> 00:57:25,134
in our strategies.

1351
00:57:25,172 --> 00:57:26,799
He wants to meet the team.

1352
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,899
Pete's going to show him
around the office next week.

1353
00:57:28,942 --> 00:57:30,204
We have to stay focused.

1354
00:57:30,243 --> 00:57:31,608
- So we want
to start communicating

1355
00:57:31,645 --> 00:57:32,873
with the managers now,

1356
00:57:32,913 --> 00:57:34,813
so they know what to expect
for the convention.

1357
00:57:34,848 --> 00:57:37,316
Doug, we're gonna need stats
on each of the product lines

1358
00:57:37,351 --> 00:57:39,512
that Intellichoice
cooked up for promotions.

1359
00:57:39,553 --> 00:57:41,111
Lila, you're gonna draft
a newsletter

1360
00:57:41,154 --> 00:57:42,382
for each one
of these managers,

1361
00:57:42,422 --> 00:57:43,616
just as a way
of preparing them.

1362
00:57:43,657 --> 00:57:44,817
Yeah, and remember,

1363
00:57:44,858 --> 00:57:46,291
there's nothing that
store managers hate more

1364
00:57:46,326 --> 00:57:47,884
than getting weird instructions
from management.

1365
00:57:47,928 --> 00:57:49,555
It has to make sense to them.

1366
00:57:49,596 --> 00:57:53,123
So what we're looking for
is simplicity, clarity, results.

1367
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:54,565
Okay?
- Okay.

1368
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:55,898
- I'll leave you guys
to your work.

1369
00:57:55,936 --> 00:57:56,925
No way.

1370
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,062
Ridiculous.

1371
00:57:58,105 --> 00:57:59,470
- What's it feel like
being perky?

1372
00:57:59,506 --> 00:58:01,371
Like, what does that feel like?

1373
00:58:02,776 --> 00:58:05,176
- Pete, can I see you
in my office?

1374
00:58:05,212 --> 00:58:06,804
Yeah.

1375
00:58:30,137 --> 00:58:32,128
- Todd Kenner
is on line three.

1376
00:58:32,172 --> 00:58:33,230
My God.

1377
00:58:33,273 --> 00:58:34,501
Yeah.

1378
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,372
Hey, Todd, what's up?

1379
00:58:38,412 --> 00:58:40,346
There's just
some software thing going on.

1380
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,043
Well, last I heard,
HP was taking care of it.

1381
00:58:44,084 --> 00:58:46,517
Hold on a second, Todd.

1382
00:58:46,552 --> 00:58:48,042
Do you need anything else?

1383
00:58:49,822 --> 00:58:50,948
No.

1384
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:53,288
Okay, thanks, Pete.

1385
00:58:53,325 --> 00:58:55,088
Hey, Todd.

1386
00:59:31,497 --> 00:59:32,964
- Hey, Susan,
how are you doing?

1387
00:59:32,998 --> 00:59:34,465
Uh, I'm fine.

1388
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,626
What's up?

1389
00:59:35,668 --> 00:59:37,898
- We just hadn't talked
in a while, and...

1390
00:59:37,937 --> 00:59:39,734
- I know, I know,
but it's really not a good time.

1391
00:59:39,772 --> 00:59:40,830
Can I call you?

1392
00:59:40,873 --> 00:59:42,670
Yeah, okay.

1393
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:44,073
I'll talk to you later.

1394
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:45,634
Bye.

1395
00:59:49,448 --> 00:59:51,245
- Hey, so that guy
who called last night,

1396
00:59:51,283 --> 00:59:53,251
Bobby McCain?

1397
00:59:53,285 --> 00:59:55,253
He said
he's setting up a label.

1398
00:59:55,287 --> 00:59:58,085
He's got financing
and a couple of bands,

1399
00:59:58,124 --> 00:59:59,421
and he wants me to run it.

1400
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:00,516
Really?

1401
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:01,856
Uh-huh.

1402
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:04,362
So I'm thinking
I'm gonna meet him for lunch

1403
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:05,658
on Saturday in the city,

1404
01:00:05,698 --> 01:00:07,665
but I don't want Susan
to know about it.

1405
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:09,997
So if you talk to her,
please don't mention anything.

1406
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:12,759
Pete.

1407
01:00:12,804 --> 01:00:13,771
Hey.

1408
01:00:14,806 --> 01:00:16,171
- How you doing, buddy?
- Good, man.

1409
01:00:16,207 --> 01:00:17,174
It's good to see you.

1410
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:19,369
It's good to see you.

1411
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:23,510
Hey, what happened to you?

1412
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:26,817
What?

1413
01:00:26,851 --> 01:00:29,319
You got a haircut.

1414
01:00:29,354 --> 01:00:32,551
- I just...
I got a corporate job.

1415
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:36,287
- Not EMI, I hope,
fucking broke assholes.

1416
01:00:36,327 --> 01:00:37,817
Yeah.

1417
01:00:37,862 --> 01:00:39,454
Uh, no, ACS.

1418
01:00:39,497 --> 01:00:40,896
You've never heard of them.

1419
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:43,093
- See, that's why
I wanted to talk to you.

1420
01:00:43,134 --> 01:00:45,102
I was out partying
with Brian Specht.

1421
01:00:45,136 --> 01:00:46,103
Mm-hmm.

1422
01:00:46,137 --> 01:00:47,104
You remember Specht?

1423
01:00:47,138 --> 01:00:48,127
Yeah, of course.

1424
01:00:49,207 --> 01:00:52,176
Fucking asshole.

1425
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:55,475
And we got to talking,
and I told him my whole plan,

1426
01:00:55,513 --> 01:00:58,607
'cause, see, I need somebody

1427
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:01,244
to run the business side
of the operation.

1428
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:02,583
Mm-hmm.

1429
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:05,555
- 'Cause you know
I'm no good with business.

1430
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:06,955
Come on.

1431
01:01:06,991 --> 01:01:10,290
I am no good with business.

1432
01:01:10,328 --> 01:01:12,125
And so he said
you were looking for something.

1433
01:01:12,163 --> 01:01:13,152
Are you?

1434
01:01:13,198 --> 01:01:14,995
- Yeah, absolutely, sure.
- Cool.

1435
01:01:15,033 --> 01:01:16,500
- Yeah.
- Because you know why?

1436
01:01:16,534 --> 01:01:18,399
'Cause it's all
fucking happening.

1437
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,932
So how did it go?

1438
01:01:22,974 --> 01:01:24,305
The money was lame.

1439
01:01:24,342 --> 01:01:25,673
I'm not 20 anymore.

1440
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:27,575
- When you were 20,
they didn't pay you anything.

1441
01:01:27,612 --> 01:01:28,771
I got to be honest with you.

1442
01:01:28,812 --> 01:01:30,302
I don't think
he has his shit together.

1443
01:01:30,347 --> 01:01:31,609
Dinosaur song.

1444
01:01:31,648 --> 01:01:33,115
Dinosaur song.

1445
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,139
Dinosaur song!

1446
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:37,585
You better put it on.

1447
01:01:37,621 --> 01:01:39,885
Dinosaur song!

1448
01:01:44,394 --> 01:01:48,330
# We are the dinosaurs
marching, marching #

1449
01:01:48,365 --> 01:01:50,560
# We are the dinosaurs #

1450
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:52,501
# What do you think of that? #

1451
01:01:52,536 --> 01:01:56,063
# We are the dinosaurs
marching, marching #

1452
01:01:56,106 --> 01:01:58,074
# We are the dinosaurs #

1453
01:01:58,108 --> 01:01:59,666
# We make the Earth flat #

1454
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:02,110
# We make the Earth flat #

1455
01:02:02,145 --> 01:02:05,672
# We stop and eat our food
when we're in the mood #

1456
01:02:05,716 --> 01:02:09,812
# We stop and eat our food
on the ground #

1457
01:02:09,853 --> 01:02:13,584
# We stop and take a rest
over in our nest #

1458
01:02:13,624 --> 01:02:18,561
# We stop and take a rest,
and then you'll hear us say #

1459
01:02:25,769 --> 01:02:27,168
Hey, sweetie, I'm sorry.

1460
01:02:27,204 --> 01:02:28,262
I fell asleep on my desk.

1461
01:02:28,305 --> 01:02:30,102
I stayed up waiting for you.

1462
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:32,665
- Come on.
I told you not to do that.

1463
01:02:32,709 --> 01:02:35,542
I was worried.

1464
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:37,547
- Well, why didn't you
call me then?

1465
01:02:37,581 --> 01:02:39,276
I don't know.

1466
01:02:39,316 --> 01:02:41,443
I didn't want to bother you.

1467
01:02:41,485 --> 01:02:43,476
I know you're doing
what you have to do.

1468
01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:47,556
I love you.

1469
01:02:47,591 --> 01:02:49,559
I love you too.

1470
01:02:49,593 --> 01:02:51,753
Yeah, I'll call later.

1471
01:02:58,768 --> 01:03:00,736
Ah.

1472
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:03,830
I went to your office,
but you were sleeping.

1473
01:03:03,873 --> 01:03:05,568
Were you here all night?

1474
01:03:05,608 --> 01:03:07,576
Yeah.

1475
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,237
Why?
Do I look bad?

1476
01:03:09,278 --> 01:03:10,302
No.

1477
01:03:10,346 --> 01:03:11,711
You look great.

1478
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:13,214
Thank you.

1479
01:03:15,084 --> 01:03:17,814
- So tell me what's gonna happen
when all this is over.

1480
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:27,429
- Bennington's gonna move me
back to L.A.

1481
01:03:27,463 --> 01:03:30,899
He's gonna put me in charge
of national strategies.

1482
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:32,628
He told you that?

1483
01:03:32,668 --> 01:03:35,136
No.

1484
01:03:35,171 --> 01:03:36,798
But he knows I want the job.

1485
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:38,807
Mm-hmm.

1486
01:03:38,841 --> 01:03:40,832
What choice does he have?

1487
01:03:43,713 --> 01:03:45,874
I might take you with me.

1488
01:03:56,459 --> 01:03:57,585
Good morning.

1489
01:03:57,626 --> 01:03:58,957
Good morning, Doug.

1490
01:03:58,995 --> 01:04:02,624
- Get ready for Bennington
in a couple hours.

1491
01:04:02,665 --> 01:04:05,190
- Mm, that's a great pot
of coffee.

1492
01:04:05,234 --> 01:04:06,565
- Jack Bennington.
- Matt Davis.

1493
01:04:06,602 --> 01:04:07,591
I've been here four years.

1494
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:09,501
I work in advisory projects.

1495
01:04:09,538 --> 01:04:11,199
- Ah, nice to know,
nice to know.

1496
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,207
Keep up the good work.
- Sure.

1497
01:04:12,241 --> 01:04:12,730
I will.
Thank you.

1498
01:04:13,541 --> 01:04:14,838
- Douglas Cain,
Jack Bennington.

1499
01:04:14,876 --> 01:04:16,366
- Doug Cain, Doug Cain.
How are you?

1500
01:04:16,411 --> 01:04:18,743
I'm very well, thanks.

1501
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,078
- If you need stats,
I'm your guy.

1502
01:04:21,116 --> 01:04:22,515
That's what I've been doing
for you.

1503
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:24,450
- Pete.
- I've been proud to do it.

1504
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:26,716
And I'm all about
making a difference

1505
01:04:26,755 --> 01:04:29,747
in this company.

1506
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:32,089
- Mr. Bennington
wants to take me, you, and Sara

1507
01:04:32,127 --> 01:04:33,890
out to dinner tonight.

1508
01:04:33,928 --> 01:04:36,328
I made a reservation for 7:00.

1509
01:04:38,633 --> 01:04:39,691
Okay.

1510
01:04:39,734 --> 01:04:40,894
I'll call Sara.

1511
01:04:44,939 --> 01:04:46,065
- No, no, I can't.
- Try it.

1512
01:04:46,107 --> 01:04:47,506
Please, please try it.
It's so good.

1513
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:48,975
- I'm on a diet.
I can't.

1514
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,773
- You will be so sad
if you don't taste this.

1515
01:04:50,812 --> 01:04:51,801
Oh...

1516
01:04:52,881 --> 01:04:53,939
Right?

1517
01:04:53,982 --> 01:04:55,779
It's amazing.
- Yes, it is.

1518
01:04:55,817 --> 01:04:57,682
So how are we coming
with the organics, Pete?

1519
01:04:57,719 --> 01:04:58,981
Oh, pretty well.

1520
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,578
It's just a shelving issue
at this point,

1521
01:05:00,622 --> 01:05:02,613
so it's not like the managers
won't know how to do it.

1522
01:05:02,657 --> 01:05:03,749
What's that about?

1523
01:05:03,792 --> 01:05:05,589
- Organics have
a special section in our store,

1524
01:05:05,627 --> 01:05:06,992
but Pete is telling us

1525
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,258
we should put our organics
next to our regular products.

1526
01:05:09,297 --> 01:05:10,855
- Well, what difference
does that make?

1527
01:05:10,899 --> 01:05:12,366
Organics cost more,

1528
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,867
so generally,
the feeling has been

1529
01:05:13,902 --> 01:05:15,529
to keep them
in their own department.

1530
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,937
You keep the price image down,
also offering some quality.

1531
01:05:18,973 --> 01:05:23,137
- Our research shows that
organics have come a long way.

1532
01:05:23,178 --> 01:05:24,577
It's a trend change.

1533
01:05:24,612 --> 01:05:25,909
It's exactly the kind of thing

1534
01:05:25,947 --> 01:05:28,313
that ACS
is the last to figure out.

1535
01:05:28,349 --> 01:05:30,078
So it's a big deal for us.

1536
01:05:31,653 --> 01:05:34,178
- Essentially,
we make more on the organics.

1537
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:37,349
- Most chains
have their own line of organics.

1538
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,518
I mean, try getting Cartwright
on board with that.

1539
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,686
Indeed.

1540
01:05:40,727 --> 01:05:43,127
Now, are you thinking
of having any more kids?

1541
01:05:43,163 --> 01:05:44,152
- I don't think so.
- Yeah.

1542
01:05:44,198 --> 01:05:45,358
Oh.

1543
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:46,923
- Come on.
- Well, excuse... uh, hello.

1544
01:05:46,967 --> 01:05:48,764
- We've been trying.
- Ah.

1545
01:05:48,802 --> 01:05:51,032
- But Pete was an only child,
and so he doesn't understand

1546
01:05:51,071 --> 01:05:52,868
why Henry would want
a brother or a sister.

1547
01:05:52,906 --> 01:05:54,134
Ah.

1548
01:05:54,174 --> 01:05:56,335
Well, I came from a big family,
and I had a big family.

1549
01:05:56,376 --> 01:05:57,536
So I guess you're right.

1550
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,341
Oh, I have to take this.

1551
01:06:01,548 --> 01:06:05,006
- This is just a thought,
Sara,

1552
01:06:05,052 --> 01:06:08,510
but how would you feel
about moving to Los Angeles

1553
01:06:08,555 --> 01:06:09,852
with your family?

1554
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:12,222
It's a nice place
to raise kids.

1555
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,819
- Oh, I mean, we are not
attached to Long Island.

1556
01:06:14,862 --> 01:06:16,989
- Well, I've been trying
to find a place for Pete

1557
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:18,998
in our national office.

1558
01:06:19,032 --> 01:06:21,057
We know
you're a talented young man,

1559
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:22,898
good education.

1560
01:06:22,936 --> 01:06:25,234
You're a good guy,
an honest guy.

1561
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:28,264
I'd hate to see you
wasting your time in...

1562
01:06:28,308 --> 01:06:30,833
well, in a regional office.

1563
01:06:30,878 --> 01:06:32,209
We'll find you something.

1564
01:06:36,116 --> 01:06:37,845
Did I miss something?

1565
01:06:37,885 --> 01:06:39,352
- No, no, no.
- Really?

1566
01:06:39,386 --> 01:06:40,546
- No.
- No.

1567
01:06:48,195 --> 01:06:52,393
- The motherfuckers at national
are screwing us up the ass.

1568
01:06:52,432 --> 01:06:53,990
They're turning the vendors
against us.

1569
01:06:54,034 --> 01:06:55,228
I saw the memos.

1570
01:06:55,269 --> 01:06:56,793
They don't want us
to make the deadline.

1571
01:06:56,837 --> 01:06:58,269
- We're just gonna
have to stop relying on them

1572
01:06:58,304 --> 01:06:59,328
and do this ourselves.

1573
01:06:59,372 --> 01:07:00,771
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.

1574
01:07:00,806 --> 01:07:03,104
We're gonna get screwed
if we don't take care of this.

1575
01:07:03,142 --> 01:07:04,234
Matt had an idea.

1576
01:07:04,277 --> 01:07:05,369
What?

1577
01:07:05,411 --> 01:07:07,242
Matt had an idea.

1578
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,579
- Yeah, okay, so we only have
a week and a half left.

1579
01:07:10,616 --> 01:07:11,742
Even though most of us

1580
01:07:11,784 --> 01:07:13,251
are gonna work
through Christmas,

1581
01:07:13,286 --> 01:07:15,914
we still got to deal with HP
and Intellichoice closing

1582
01:07:15,955 --> 01:07:17,445
and so is communications.

1583
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:18,787
And the store managers

1584
01:07:18,824 --> 01:07:21,054
are doing their whole
Christmas overtime thing, so...

1585
01:07:21,093 --> 01:07:22,993
- The bottom line is,
we're not gonna make it.

1586
01:07:23,029 --> 01:07:24,997
- What are you talking about?
- It's true.

1587
01:07:25,031 --> 01:07:26,828
There just aren't enough hours
in the day.

1588
01:07:26,866 --> 01:07:28,731
There isn't enough time
to get it all done.

1589
01:07:28,768 --> 01:07:30,565
But if we were to cut

1590
01:07:30,603 --> 01:07:32,628
just two, three
of the strategies,

1591
01:07:32,672 --> 01:07:34,833
we'll be able to finish
everything else free and clear.

1592
01:07:34,874 --> 01:07:37,365
Otherwise, we're screwed.

1593
01:07:39,045 --> 01:07:41,639
Does Susan know about this?

1594
01:07:41,681 --> 01:07:45,811
- Well, we thought that maybe
you could talk to her.

1595
01:07:45,851 --> 01:07:48,581
You know, you seem to have
a special relationship with her.

1596
01:07:48,621 --> 01:07:50,248
- What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1597
01:07:50,289 --> 01:07:52,450
- I don't know, Pete.
What does it mean?

1598
01:07:52,491 --> 01:07:55,051
- Okay, it just means
someone has to talk to her...

1599
01:07:55,094 --> 01:07:56,891
This is bullshit!

1600
01:07:56,929 --> 01:08:00,228
Well, we can't just cut
our strategies now!

1601
01:08:00,266 --> 01:08:02,200
I can't believe you guys.

1602
01:08:02,235 --> 01:08:04,533
We've been busting our balls
here for three months,

1603
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:05,935
and you just want to give up?

1604
01:08:05,972 --> 01:08:07,269
All we're saying is,

1605
01:08:07,306 --> 01:08:09,103
we can't get a few
of these strategies ready.

1606
01:08:09,141 --> 01:08:10,472
No way!

1607
01:08:10,509 --> 01:08:12,534
I'm not gonna just sit here
and watch you tell Susan

1608
01:08:12,578 --> 01:08:14,045
that this can't be done.

1609
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,446
I mean, do you know the kind
of pressure that she's under?

1610
01:08:16,482 --> 01:08:20,281
Do you know that
she stuck her neck out for us?

1611
01:08:20,318 --> 01:08:21,478
No.

1612
01:08:21,519 --> 01:08:24,955
No, what we're doing here
is kicking ass.

1613
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:26,480
And I don't care
if we have to stay here

1614
01:08:26,524 --> 01:08:31,154
all fucking week
for the next week and a half

1615
01:08:31,196 --> 01:08:32,993
to get this done,

1616
01:08:33,031 --> 01:08:34,521
or maybe even two weeks.

1617
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:36,864
We don't know how long
it's gonna take,

1618
01:08:36,901 --> 01:08:38,835
but we are gonna do this.

1619
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:40,303
All we are saying is,

1620
01:08:40,338 --> 01:08:42,966
we can't get
two of these strategies ready.

1621
01:08:43,008 --> 01:08:45,306
- Well, why the fuck not?
Huh?

1622
01:08:45,343 --> 01:08:48,312
I mean, you and Pete
understand this stuff.

1623
01:08:48,346 --> 01:08:51,315
I know that because you got me
to understand it.

1624
01:08:51,349 --> 01:08:55,479
So can we just stop all the talk
about cutting strategies

1625
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,647
and apply ourselves?

1626
01:08:57,689 --> 01:08:59,657
She's right.

1627
01:08:59,691 --> 01:09:01,181
We can get this done.

1628
01:09:02,661 --> 01:09:04,026
Hey.

1629
01:09:04,062 --> 01:09:06,360
Susan wants to see everyone
out in the office

1630
01:09:06,398 --> 01:09:08,628
for a Christmas toast.

1631
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:12,398
- I'd like to share
this letter from Mr. Bennington

1632
01:09:12,437 --> 01:09:13,563
with all of you.

1633
01:09:13,605 --> 01:09:16,096
"In my years,
I've never seen a team

1634
01:09:16,141 --> 01:09:21,545
"work so hard
and do such excellent work.

1635
01:09:21,579 --> 01:09:23,376
"These presentations
mark a new beginning

1636
01:09:23,415 --> 01:09:27,317
"for Wolski's, ACS,

1637
01:09:27,352 --> 01:09:30,014
and a new direction
in this industry. "

1638
01:09:30,055 --> 01:09:31,113
Blah, blah, blah.

1639
01:09:31,156 --> 01:09:34,421
"You are all
the best of the best. "

1640
01:09:36,928 --> 01:09:38,589
I just want to say,

1641
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:41,098
I've never seen
a group of people

1642
01:09:41,132 --> 01:09:43,122
come together like this.

1643
01:09:44,668 --> 01:09:46,795
Now, I want you
to take Christmas off.

1644
01:09:46,837 --> 01:09:49,806
Go home.
See your families.

1645
01:09:51,909 --> 01:09:54,207
You're gonna need a lot of rest
before next week.

1646
01:09:54,244 --> 01:09:58,305
Louisville will be hard work,
but we can do it.

1647
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:01,947
Merry Christmas.

1648
01:10:01,985 --> 01:10:03,009
Cheers.

1649
01:10:03,053 --> 01:10:04,042
Cheers.

1650
01:10:04,088 --> 01:10:05,077
Merry Christmas.

1651
01:10:05,122 --> 01:10:06,146
Happy holidays.

1652
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:08,658
You guys blow me away.

1653
01:10:08,692 --> 01:10:11,422
Ah, no, we can't eat it.

1654
01:10:11,462 --> 01:10:12,451
It's too big.

1655
01:10:14,431 --> 01:10:15,898
Turning into transformer...

1656
01:10:20,204 --> 01:10:22,832
Hey.

1657
01:10:22,873 --> 01:10:23,999
Why don't you grab that?

1658
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:25,633
I'm gonna put on a sweater.

1659
01:10:25,676 --> 01:10:26,734
I'm freezing.

1660
01:10:26,777 --> 01:10:28,244
Arr, arr!

1661
01:10:28,278 --> 01:10:31,304
I'll be right back...
oh, he's gonna eat the crayon.

1662
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,151
- Hi.
- Hi.

1663
01:10:38,188 --> 01:10:39,485
I'm not staying.

1664
01:10:39,523 --> 01:10:40,683
What's going on?

1665
01:10:40,724 --> 01:10:44,888
- I wanted to drop off
a present for Henry.

1666
01:10:44,928 --> 01:10:46,122
Oh, well, come in.

1667
01:10:46,163 --> 01:10:48,290
Wait, you don't have plans
for Christmas?

1668
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:50,732
I was working, but then...

1669
01:10:50,768 --> 01:10:52,326
I got really depressed.

1670
01:10:52,369 --> 01:10:53,768
I meant to give this to Pete
at work.

1671
01:10:53,804 --> 01:10:55,533
- Come in, come on.
Have a drink.

1672
01:10:55,572 --> 01:10:56,834
Can we open it?

1673
01:10:56,874 --> 01:10:57,841
Yes.

1674
01:10:57,875 --> 01:10:59,467
Yay.

1675
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:02,945
A Barbie thing.

1676
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:03,947
It's Barbie.

1677
01:11:03,981 --> 01:11:04,947
Yeah.

1678
01:11:04,981 --> 01:11:05,970
Isn't she pretty?

1679
01:11:06,015 --> 01:11:07,448
I don't like it.

1680
01:11:07,483 --> 01:11:09,075
- What do you mean,
you don't like it?

1681
01:11:09,118 --> 01:11:10,244
She's a woman.

1682
01:11:10,286 --> 01:11:11,310
I don't like women.

1683
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:12,343
You don't?

1684
01:11:12,388 --> 01:11:13,446
Why not?

1685
01:11:13,489 --> 01:11:14,478
Because.

1686
01:11:14,524 --> 01:11:15,513
Because why?

1687
01:11:15,558 --> 01:11:16,889
Do you like me?

1688
01:11:16,926 --> 01:11:18,791
Yeah.

1689
01:11:18,828 --> 01:11:20,193
Thank you.

1690
01:11:20,229 --> 01:11:21,287
You're welcome.

1691
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:23,161
- Sit down next to me.
- Oh.

1692
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:26,965
- You guys
are so great together.

1693
01:11:29,172 --> 01:11:32,403
You're so down to earth,
honest.

1694
01:11:35,278 --> 01:11:36,905
What's the point of my life?

1695
01:11:38,047 --> 01:11:40,174
You're doing a good job.

1696
01:11:40,216 --> 01:11:42,241
Fuck work.

1697
01:11:42,285 --> 01:11:43,411
Who really gives a shit

1698
01:11:43,453 --> 01:11:46,251
if Wolski's
gets a few more customers?

1699
01:11:49,292 --> 01:11:50,782
I thought it was important.

1700
01:11:50,827 --> 01:11:54,319
- You know
what I'm talking about.

1701
01:11:57,133 --> 01:11:59,533
You know what I like
about Pete?

1702
01:12:02,472 --> 01:12:05,100
He really knows me.

1703
01:12:05,141 --> 01:12:07,132
He listens.

1704
01:12:09,345 --> 01:12:12,143
He notices things.

1705
01:12:12,181 --> 01:12:15,480
It's like, I don't even
have to say anything,

1706
01:12:15,518 --> 01:12:17,213
and he knows
what I'm thinking.

1707
01:12:21,224 --> 01:12:23,351
- We really appreciate
everything you've done for him.

1708
01:12:23,392 --> 01:12:25,519
It's...
- Mm-hmm.

1709
01:12:25,561 --> 01:12:27,152
Really changed our lives.

1710
01:12:27,195 --> 01:12:31,461
- Yeah, well, that's not what
I'm talking about.

1711
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,161
- Pete, why don't you
go put Henry to bed?

1712
01:12:33,201 --> 01:12:34,828
And I will get some sheets
for the couch.

1713
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:37,532
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1714
01:12:37,572 --> 01:12:38,937
Come here.

1715
01:12:40,108 --> 01:12:42,133
- But I don't have to do bed.
- Okay.

1716
01:12:50,252 --> 01:12:52,186
She's going to sleep.

1717
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:53,380
Come in here.

1718
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:57,558
Let me just say good night.

1719
01:12:57,592 --> 01:12:58,718
Don't worry.

1720
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,251
You'll see her in the morning.

1721
01:13:06,768 --> 01:13:07,792
Bah!

1722
01:13:07,836 --> 01:13:09,497
What the fuck?

1723
01:13:14,009 --> 01:13:15,806
Don't do that.

1724
01:13:18,413 --> 01:13:20,973
Oh, God.

1725
01:13:26,288 --> 01:13:28,279
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1726
01:13:42,571 --> 01:13:44,436
You guys obviously
can't handle this stuff.

1727
01:13:44,472 --> 01:13:45,769
We have to get ACS
to help you.

1728
01:13:45,807 --> 01:13:48,570
- The vendors
are calling ACS to pressure us.

1729
01:13:48,609 --> 01:13:49,906
- That's why we need
their help.

1730
01:13:49,944 --> 01:13:50,933
Yeah, but...

1731
01:13:50,978 --> 01:13:52,411
- The vendors
think they can muscle us

1732
01:13:52,446 --> 01:13:54,141
because they
aren't taking us seriously.

1733
01:13:54,181 --> 01:13:56,012
We have to use ACS
to talk to them.

1734
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:57,074
- Yeah, I...
- No, just do it.

1735
01:13:57,117 --> 01:13:59,608
Then you'll understand,
all right?

1736
01:13:59,653 --> 01:14:01,143
How's your stuff
coming along, Pete?

1737
01:14:01,188 --> 01:14:03,383
- Good.
We'll be all right.

1738
01:14:03,424 --> 01:14:05,051
- I mean,
what do you have to show me?

1739
01:14:07,261 --> 01:14:08,956
Uh, I don't...

1740
01:14:08,996 --> 01:14:10,623
have anything to show you.

1741
01:14:10,664 --> 01:14:12,131
I was just, you know,

1742
01:14:12,166 --> 01:14:14,157
hoping you might cut me
a little slack.

1743
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:15,498
Why would I do that?

1744
01:14:15,536 --> 01:14:16,935
This is a progress meeting.

1745
01:14:16,971 --> 01:14:18,802
I need to see progress.

1746
01:14:18,839 --> 01:14:20,807
- Okay, uh,
we're making progress.

1747
01:14:20,841 --> 01:14:23,241
- I don't need a meeting to know
that you're doing something.

1748
01:14:23,277 --> 01:14:26,576
I need a meeting to see
what it is that you're doing.

1749
01:14:26,614 --> 01:14:28,138
What is your problem?

1750
01:14:31,185 --> 01:14:33,312
- Just bring it in my office
in an hour, okay?

1751
01:14:33,354 --> 01:14:35,322
In an hour.

1752
01:14:35,356 --> 01:14:36,345
Go.

1753
01:14:37,591 --> 01:14:40,651
- There's no reason
for you to be here.

1754
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:45,096
- Hi, I'm sorry I didn't
bring this to the meeting.

1755
01:14:45,132 --> 01:14:47,225
I was, um...
I was out of line.

1756
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:52,268
You lied to me.

1757
01:14:52,306 --> 01:14:53,967
What?

1758
01:14:54,008 --> 01:14:55,566
You lied to me.

1759
01:14:57,044 --> 01:14:59,478
You never went to Dartmouth.

1760
01:14:59,513 --> 01:15:01,174
- What?
- Did you?

1761
01:15:01,215 --> 01:15:03,706
Yes, I went to Dartmouth.

1762
01:15:08,522 --> 01:15:11,149
- Mr. Bennington was planning
on offering you a job in L.A.

1763
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,521
As is standard procedure,

1764
01:15:12,558 --> 01:15:14,992
they hired a private detective
team to check you out.

1765
01:15:15,028 --> 01:15:17,462
Dartmouth
has no record of you.

1766
01:15:17,497 --> 01:15:18,896
- Well, they didn't check
properly.

1767
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:19,920
I did go.

1768
01:15:19,966 --> 01:15:21,365
- I thought
that might be the case,

1769
01:15:21,401 --> 01:15:24,234
so I called them myself.

1770
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,760
They have no record of you.

1771
01:15:39,018 --> 01:15:41,316
I didn't graduate.

1772
01:15:41,354 --> 01:15:44,152
I went for two years,
and then I left.

1773
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:46,158
My father lost his job.

1774
01:15:46,192 --> 01:15:48,660
I couldn't afford it
anymore, so...

1775
01:15:56,035 --> 01:16:00,199
- You said you graduated
on your résumé.

1776
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:01,433
Yeah, I needed the job.

1777
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:04,068
It was not a big lie.

1778
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:05,702
It's a huge lie.

1779
01:16:05,745 --> 01:16:07,337
- Nobody cared
until you came along.

1780
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:08,938
- But I did care.
I do care.

1781
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,915
It's important to me.

1782
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:12,008
What are you gonna do?

1783
01:16:12,051 --> 01:16:13,075
I don't know what I can do.

1784
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:14,518
They want me to press charges.

1785
01:16:14,554 --> 01:16:16,283
What?

1786
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:18,017
Look, I didn't know
it was that big of a deal.

1787
01:16:18,057 --> 01:16:20,821
- It's a huge fucking deal,
okay?

1788
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,986
You let me down!

1789
01:16:22,028 --> 01:16:23,359
I thought you were perfect!

1790
01:16:23,396 --> 01:16:26,160
You didn't even look so bad
once you put on a suit.

1791
01:16:26,199 --> 01:16:28,690
Now you're just another asshole
who cheats on his wife

1792
01:16:28,735 --> 01:16:31,295
and lies about
how smart he is.

1793
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:32,963
- You told me
all you wanted was a baby.

1794
01:16:33,004 --> 01:16:35,871
Well, it didn't work.

1795
01:16:35,907 --> 01:16:37,932
I'm not pregnant.

1796
01:16:37,976 --> 01:16:39,307
Well, Sara is.

1797
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,402
That's great.

1798
01:16:40,445 --> 01:16:43,505
That's fucking great.

1799
01:16:43,548 --> 01:16:46,142
I guess that's my fault too.

1800
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:47,344
Get away from me.

1801
01:16:51,289 --> 01:16:52,916
Hey, Donna, send them in.

1802
01:16:55,393 --> 01:16:57,554
I'll do what I can to stop them
from pressing charges,

1803
01:16:57,596 --> 01:16:59,223
but your work here
is no longer tenable.

1804
01:16:59,264 --> 01:17:01,198
You should just take your jacket
and leave.

1805
01:17:01,233 --> 01:17:02,928
You can't take our work,
obviously.

1806
01:17:02,968 --> 01:17:04,367
I have to remind you,

1807
01:17:04,402 --> 01:17:06,700
you signed
a confidentiality contract.

1808
01:17:06,738 --> 01:17:08,069
That's it?

1809
01:17:08,106 --> 01:17:10,506
- Don't make this any harder
than it already is.

1810
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:53,183
What are we going to do?

1811
01:17:53,218 --> 01:17:54,617
- I'll just...
I'll get another job.

1812
01:17:54,653 --> 01:17:55,846
- Yeah,
but what about the car?

1813
01:17:55,886 --> 01:17:57,012
What about the mortgage?

1814
01:17:57,054 --> 01:17:58,612
- Don't we have money
saved up?

1815
01:17:58,656 --> 01:18:00,681
- We have some money
in our checking account, yes,

1816
01:18:00,724 --> 01:18:03,056
but we still owe,
like, $28,000 on the Visa.

1817
01:18:04,595 --> 01:18:06,187
Bobby, hey, it's Pete.

1818
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:07,822
I know it's been a while.

1819
01:18:07,865 --> 01:18:09,992
I was just wondering
if you found anyone

1820
01:18:10,034 --> 01:18:11,899
to run your label.

1821
01:18:11,936 --> 01:18:13,403
Oh, yeah.

1822
01:18:13,437 --> 01:18:14,495
You know Jim Sall?

1823
01:18:14,538 --> 01:18:17,166
Yeah, I know him.

1824
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:19,369
The guy's doing a great job.

1825
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:21,742
I know, Dad.

1826
01:18:23,681 --> 01:18:24,807
We just need a little

1827
01:18:24,849 --> 01:18:27,818
to get us through
the next couple months.

1828
01:18:29,019 --> 01:18:31,010
He is not that bad.

1829
01:18:32,389 --> 01:18:34,016
Hey, Doug,

1830
01:18:34,058 --> 01:18:37,186
just wondering
how the project was going.

1831
01:18:37,228 --> 01:18:38,525
How did it go
in Louisville?

1832
01:18:38,562 --> 01:18:40,553
What do you care, man?

1833
01:18:40,598 --> 01:18:43,999
- Well, I had a lot
invested in that,

1834
01:18:44,034 --> 01:18:45,501
wanted to know
how it was turning out.

1835
01:18:45,536 --> 01:18:46,764
Let me tell you something.

1836
01:18:46,804 --> 01:18:48,465
You didn't get fired
because of that thing

1837
01:18:48,505 --> 01:18:49,563
on your résumé.

1838
01:18:49,607 --> 01:18:51,268
The job that Bennington
was gonna give you

1839
01:18:51,308 --> 01:18:52,900
was the job
that Susan wanted.

1840
01:18:52,943 --> 01:18:55,741
He was gonna put you
in national marketing at ACS.

1841
01:18:55,779 --> 01:18:57,246
Susan found out about it.

1842
01:18:57,281 --> 01:18:58,771
No way.

1843
01:19:01,185 --> 01:19:02,311
How do you know that?

1844
01:19:02,353 --> 01:19:03,980
I just know it, okay?

1845
01:19:04,021 --> 01:19:05,010
You have to move on.

1846
01:19:05,055 --> 01:19:06,386
Strength, brother.

1847
01:19:21,604 --> 01:19:23,231
There's a job in the city.

1848
01:19:23,273 --> 01:19:25,366
They're hiring
at Arista Records.

1849
01:19:25,408 --> 01:19:26,602
How much does it pay?

1850
01:19:26,643 --> 01:19:28,474
- $30,000,
but it's in the music business.

1851
01:19:29,779 --> 01:19:31,508
There's no future
in the music business.

1852
01:19:31,547 --> 01:19:33,208
They're hiring.

1853
01:19:33,249 --> 01:19:35,046
$30,000?

1854
01:19:35,084 --> 01:19:36,642
You could get a job.

1855
01:19:36,686 --> 01:19:37,710
I'm pregnant.

1856
01:19:37,754 --> 01:19:40,154
Who's gonna hire me?

1857
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:42,282
I'd hire you.

1858
01:19:48,598 --> 01:19:50,293
One more bite of pasta.

1859
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:52,699
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes yes!

1860
01:19:52,735 --> 01:19:54,464
No, no, no, no, no.

1861
01:19:54,504 --> 01:19:55,971
- Is Daddy gonna eat
all your pasta?

1862
01:19:56,005 --> 01:19:57,336
Oh, boy, lucky Daddy.

1863
01:19:59,175 --> 01:20:00,199
Don't answer it.

1864
01:20:00,243 --> 01:20:02,074
It's a creditor.

1865
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:03,578
Eat all my pasta.

1866
01:20:03,613 --> 01:20:06,446
- Yeah, I'm gonna eat
all your pasta.

1867
01:20:06,482 --> 01:20:08,814
- Susan Felders
gave me your number.

1868
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:11,319
Did you eat all of my food?

1869
01:20:11,354 --> 01:20:14,152
- I work for a company
called Advantage One.

1870
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:16,317
We're an executive
recruiting agency,

1871
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:18,054
and I'd really like
to talk to you

1872
01:20:18,094 --> 01:20:19,891
about your plans
for the future.

1873
01:20:19,929 --> 01:20:21,157
I'm in L. A.

1874
01:20:21,197 --> 01:20:22,164
I want to get out of...

1875
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:24,166
Hi, sorry, yeah.

1876
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,929
Uh, this is Pete Cozy.

1877
01:20:25,969 --> 01:20:26,993
Yeah.

1878
01:20:27,036 --> 01:20:28,162
- I want to get out
of the seat.

1879
01:20:28,204 --> 01:20:29,102
One sec.

1880
01:20:32,175 --> 01:20:34,643
What did he say?

1881
01:20:34,677 --> 01:20:38,807
- He said that
with my experience,

1882
01:20:38,848 --> 01:20:40,280
he thinks
he could find me a job.

1883
01:20:40,315 --> 01:20:42,442
Well, what kind of job?

1884
01:20:42,484 --> 01:20:43,644
Marketing, supermarkets,

1885
01:20:43,685 --> 01:20:46,415
same kind of thing
I've been doing,

1886
01:20:46,455 --> 01:20:48,423
maybe even
with my own department.

1887
01:20:48,457 --> 01:20:50,482
He said there were a couple
of jobs on the West Coast

1888
01:20:50,525 --> 01:20:51,958
he would love
to send me out for,

1889
01:20:51,994 --> 01:20:53,359
even with what happened.

1890
01:20:53,395 --> 01:20:55,863
- Did he give you any idea
how much these jobs would pay?

1891
01:20:55,897 --> 01:20:59,333
- $100,000 plus benefits
and year-end bonus.

1892
01:20:59,368 --> 01:21:00,892
Jesus.

1893
01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:02,961
That is great news.

1894
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,402
- I told him
I'd think about it.

1895
01:21:07,442 --> 01:21:09,137
What?

1896
01:21:09,177 --> 01:21:11,441
Why?

1897
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:15,246
- Because I don't want
to do this my whole life.

1898
01:21:15,283 --> 01:21:17,148
The only thing I've ever wanted
to do with my life

1899
01:21:17,185 --> 01:21:19,710
is work in music.

1900
01:21:19,755 --> 01:21:21,154
I may not have made
that much money,

1901
01:21:21,189 --> 01:21:22,281
but I was happier.

1902
01:21:22,324 --> 01:21:24,349
What are you talking about?

1903
01:21:24,393 --> 01:21:25,553
What difference does it make

1904
01:21:25,594 --> 01:21:27,061
if you market music
or groceries?

1905
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:28,323
It makes a difference to me.

1906
01:21:28,363 --> 01:21:31,457
- $30,000 a year
for an entry-level position?

1907
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,626
No, no way.

1908
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:35,135
I'm too old for that.

1909
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:36,603
I think I'm gonna start
my own label.

1910
01:21:37,873 --> 01:21:40,000
- I've learned a lot
over these past years.

1911
01:21:40,042 --> 01:21:41,566
How are you gonna pay for it?

1912
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:42,736
I'll draw up a business plan.

1913
01:21:42,778 --> 01:21:43,904
I'll get loans,
an investor.

1914
01:21:43,945 --> 01:21:45,469
Who's gonna give you a loan?

1915
01:21:45,514 --> 01:21:47,744
We're not even gonna make
next month's mortgage payment.

1916
01:21:47,783 --> 01:21:48,909
So an investor.

1917
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:51,248
- My dad is not gonna give you
any more money.

1918
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:53,083
- I'm not talking
about your father.

1919
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:55,919
Look, if we sold this house,
we would still make money,

1920
01:21:55,957 --> 01:21:57,356
even after we paid
the mortgage.

1921
01:21:57,392 --> 01:21:58,689
What are we gonna live on?

1922
01:21:58,727 --> 01:22:01,355
- What do other people do,
huh?

1923
01:22:01,396 --> 01:22:03,158
They get by.

1924
01:22:03,197 --> 01:22:06,189
We can live in a small apartment
in the city for a while.

1925
01:22:06,233 --> 01:22:08,724
I know you're not any happier
here than I am.

1926
01:22:08,769 --> 01:22:10,862
- God, it's not like any
of those labels you worked on

1927
01:22:10,905 --> 01:22:12,167
ever took off
or made any money.

1928
01:22:12,206 --> 01:22:14,299
- Well, I didn't know then
what I know now.

1929
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:18,103
Did you sleep with Susan?

1930
01:22:18,145 --> 01:22:20,477
What?

1931
01:22:20,514 --> 01:22:21,640
No.

1932
01:22:21,682 --> 01:22:23,946
- It all changed
when you came back from L.A.

1933
01:22:23,984 --> 01:22:26,282
I know you slept with her.

1934
01:22:28,556 --> 01:22:31,650
- Why are you waiting till now
to bring this up?

1935
01:22:31,692 --> 01:22:33,660
Oh, God, I feel sick.

1936
01:22:33,694 --> 01:22:35,161
- Could it be that
you were okay with it

1937
01:22:35,196 --> 01:22:38,165
as long as I was making
good money?

1938
01:22:38,199 --> 01:22:41,896
You are so selfish.

1939
01:22:41,936 --> 01:22:43,995
How can you say that?

1940
01:22:44,038 --> 01:22:45,835
Oh, my God.
- Sara.

1941
01:22:45,873 --> 01:22:48,341
- We have a child,
and I am pregnant.

1942
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:50,002
Why would you do this to me?

1943
01:22:50,044 --> 01:22:51,170
- Stop it.
You know I love you.

1944
01:22:51,212 --> 01:22:52,201
What am I doing?

1945
01:22:52,246 --> 01:22:53,736
I cannot believe
that I am pregnant.

1946
01:22:53,781 --> 01:22:54,941
Let's talk about this.

1947
01:22:54,982 --> 01:22:56,779
Listen to me...
- You stay away from me.

1948
01:22:56,817 --> 01:22:57,784
- No.
Sara, come on.

1949
01:22:57,818 --> 01:22:58,785
No!

1950
01:22:58,819 --> 01:22:59,786
Mommy!

1951
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:00,912
Sara...

1952
01:23:00,955 --> 01:23:02,616
Henry.

1953
01:23:09,029 --> 01:23:11,088
- It's all right.
It's okay, buddy.

1954
01:23:11,132 --> 01:23:12,929
No, it's okay.
Hey, come on, it's all right.

1955
01:23:12,967 --> 01:23:14,229
- I don't want to look
at you.

1956
01:23:14,268 --> 01:23:15,496
- Come on,
open up the door.

1957
01:23:15,536 --> 01:23:16,594
I'm done.

1958
01:23:18,405 --> 01:23:19,963
Sara, please.

1959
01:23:20,007 --> 01:23:21,338
Please.

1960
01:23:23,344 --> 01:23:24,833
Sara!

1961
01:23:24,878 --> 01:23:26,573
Come on,
let's talk about this.

1962
01:23:58,912 --> 01:24:04,908
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh #

1963
01:24:04,951 --> 01:24:08,387
# Ooh, ooh, ooh #

1964
01:24:08,421 --> 01:24:12,551
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh #

1965
01:24:12,592 --> 01:24:15,993
# Sun comes up #

1966
01:24:16,029 --> 01:24:19,192
# Sun goes down #

1967
01:24:19,232 --> 01:24:21,200
# Tired old world #

1968
01:24:21,234 --> 01:24:25,432
# Spins round and round #

1969
01:24:25,471 --> 01:24:28,440
# Nothing
chills the summer #

1970
01:24:28,474 --> 01:24:31,739
# And my love comes in... #

1971
01:24:38,351 --> 01:24:39,682
Henry.

1972
01:24:41,487 --> 01:24:42,954
Henry?

1973
01:24:49,394 --> 01:24:51,726
Henry?

1974
01:24:54,566 --> 01:24:55,555
Hey, hey, hey.

1975
01:24:55,601 --> 01:24:56,693
What are you doing?

1976
01:24:56,735 --> 01:24:58,430
You can't run away like that,
come on.

1977
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:59,835
Pete.

1978
01:24:59,871 --> 01:25:02,169
Susan.

1979
01:25:02,207 --> 01:25:03,902
What are you doing here?

1980
01:25:03,942 --> 01:25:06,240
Hi.

1981
01:25:06,278 --> 01:25:08,246
Uh, I'm shopping.

1982
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,771
I live around here.

1983
01:25:10,816 --> 01:25:12,579
Is that yours?

1984
01:25:12,618 --> 01:25:14,449
Yeah, his name is Syd.

1985
01:25:16,054 --> 01:25:18,454
Henry found me.

1986
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:21,482
So you moved back here.

1987
01:25:21,526 --> 01:25:24,290
- Um, yeah,
I'm head of marketing at ACS,

1988
01:25:24,329 --> 01:25:26,627
brought Lila and Donna
here with me.

1989
01:25:26,665 --> 01:25:27,689
Yeah, it's cool.

1990
01:25:27,733 --> 01:25:28,961
Susie, plain or butter?

1991
01:25:29,001 --> 01:25:31,196
Um, both of 'em.

1992
01:25:31,236 --> 01:25:33,466
Do you remember Pete, Ernie?

1993
01:25:33,505 --> 01:25:34,563
We're married.

1994
01:25:34,606 --> 01:25:38,064
- Oh, hey.
- Congratulations.

1995
01:25:39,444 --> 01:25:41,435
- Ah, I have to take this.
This is an important call.

1996
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,038
Okay.

1997
01:25:45,117 --> 01:25:47,210
Cute baby.

1998
01:25:47,252 --> 01:25:49,777
Looks like you.

1999
01:25:49,821 --> 01:25:53,086
Yeah, you think so?

2000
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:54,251
I'd better get going.

2001
01:25:54,293 --> 01:25:56,090
Come on.

2002
01:25:56,128 --> 01:25:57,117
I'll see you around.

2003
01:25:57,162 --> 01:25:58,652
Yeah, later.

2004
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,431
Who was that weird guy?

2005
01:26:03,468 --> 01:26:04,594
Oh, I'm gonna eat you.

2006
01:26:04,636 --> 01:26:05,864
I think so.

2007
01:26:05,904 --> 01:26:07,872
I want to go on a big plane.

2008
01:26:07,906 --> 01:26:09,270
- You want to go
on a big plane?

2009
01:26:09,307 --> 01:26:10,865
Yeah.

2010
01:26:13,077 --> 01:26:14,408
Hello.
- Henry?

2011
01:26:14,445 --> 01:26:16,242
Hi, you guys.

2012
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,578
How was the supermarket?

2013
01:26:18,616 --> 01:26:20,447
Good?

2014
01:26:20,484 --> 01:26:21,974
We saw Daddy's friend.

2015
01:26:22,019 --> 01:26:23,111
Really, who?

2016
01:26:23,154 --> 01:26:25,281
Oh, just someone from work.

2017
01:26:25,323 --> 01:26:26,483
Hey, I was thinking

2018
01:26:26,524 --> 01:26:27,991
we could take a walk
down to the beach.

2019
01:26:28,025 --> 01:26:29,322
- Uh, maybe you
can take them down,

2020
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,349
and I'll just meet you.

2021
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:31,554
I still have some work to do.

2022
01:26:31,595 --> 01:26:32,721
Oh, it's Sunday.

2023
01:26:32,763 --> 01:26:35,391
- I know.
What do you want me to say?

2024
01:26:35,433 --> 01:26:36,900
- All right.
I love you.

2025
01:26:36,934 --> 01:26:38,231
I love you too.

2026
01:26:38,269 --> 01:26:39,327
Mm.

2027
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:40,359
Bye, cutie.

2028
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:41,598
- Say,
"See you later, Daddy. "

2029
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:42,833
- Bye, cutie.
- See you later.

2030
01:26:42,873 --> 01:26:43,862
Bye.

2031
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:46,342
Hey, Henry, let's go.

2032
01:27:25,883 --> 01:27:30,616
# Iceman, iceman,
candy man, and sandman #

2033
01:27:30,654 --> 01:27:33,178
# All the things
I wanted for #

2034
01:27:33,223 --> 01:27:35,521
# Someone else took them #

2035
01:27:35,558 --> 01:27:39,995
# Lonely in a new shirt,
lonely watching baseball #

2036
01:27:40,029 --> 01:27:44,432
# If I had to do it all again,
I wouldn't #

2037
01:27:44,467 --> 01:27:49,166
# Throw it all away #

2038
01:27:49,205 --> 01:27:53,938
# Throw it all away #

2039
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:58,710
# I want a holiday #

2040
01:27:58,748 --> 01:28:04,084
# I want a holiday #

2041
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:08,716
# Marigold and tangerine,
I have dreamed an empty dream #

2042
01:28:08,758 --> 01:28:10,988
# I am slow
and you are too #

2043
01:28:11,027 --> 01:28:13,689
# Someone tell me what to do #

2044
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:18,064
# Lonely on a Wednesday,
lonely on a Friday #

2045
01:28:18,101 --> 01:28:22,595
# If I had to do it all again,
I wouldn't #

2046
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:27,372
# Throw it all away #

2047
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:32,109
# Throw it all away #

2048
01:28:32,148 --> 01:28:36,812
# I want a holiday #

2049
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:40,880
# I want a holiday #

2050
01:29:00,742 --> 01:29:05,543
# I'm tired
of having no future #

2051
01:29:05,581 --> 01:29:10,211
# And I'm tired
of pushing my luck #

2052
01:29:10,252 --> 01:29:15,383
# And I'm tired
of waiting for the endgame #

2053
01:29:15,424 --> 01:29:19,724
# Watching the stars
turn black #

2054
01:29:19,761 --> 01:29:24,494
# Throw it all away #

2055
01:29:24,533 --> 01:29:29,027
# Throw it all away #

2056
01:29:29,071 --> 01:29:33,974
# I want a holiday #

2057
01:29:34,009 --> 01:29:39,345
# I want a holiday #
