1
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,407
Got it?

2
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,972
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

3
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,942
You are everything you can be.

4
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,408
Thank you.

5
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,944
We're gonna make it, Z Bob.
It is no big deal.

6
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,716
It's really bad luck. I promise you,
something bad's gonna happen.

7
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,920
You're fine, son.

8
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,629
Step back and remove any metal objects
from your person.

9
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,799
Oh, my God,
they're boarding group two already.

10
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,066
He's gonna miss it. That's it, man.
He's gonna miss his own bachelor party.

11
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,267
Shut up, man!
He's not gonna miss anything.

12
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,210
You're gonna get to see your precious
Huey Newton guy.

13
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,645
Wayne. Wayne Newton.

14
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:39,443
Okay, Huey Newton was
a founding member of the Black Panthers.

15
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,113
- How can you not know that?
- Why should I?

16
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,716
Well, you're, you know...

17
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,382
- Because...
- Because I'm what?

18
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,389
- You're a...
- I'm a?

19
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:53,693
You got a 1600 on your SAT, and
you just graduated Northwestern with a 4.0.

20
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,496
- You ought to know things like that.
- You know I got a 1600...

21
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,799
the same way I got a 4.0. I cheated.

22
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:08,740
God, I... Boy, I tell you, man,
white girls, they...

23
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,375
It just seems like
their butts are growing, man.

24
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,510
What makes you so sure
he's not gonna miss it?

25
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,054
Before y'all used to just have titties,
and that was it.

26
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,750
- Wait.
- Now all of a sudden you got titties and ass.

27
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,921
Please come with me, sir.

28
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,032
- I told you it was bad luck.
- Hurry up, we're already late.

29
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,602
I still can't believe Nathan let Z Bob
plan this whole weekend...

30
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,138
after everything else he's screwed up.

31
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,208
Well, his brother hooked him up
with this bachelor-party guru.

32
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,569
So not even Z Bob can screw this up.

33
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:40,974
As a courtesy you could've at least...

34
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:53,719
You okay?

35
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:57,594
- Don't say anything about this, all right?
- About what?

36
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,320
Come on.

37
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,103
- Does that have any business news in it?
- You wanna check it out?

38
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,671
- Please.
- Okay.

39
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,240
Go ahead, man.

40
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,112
This has business news?

41
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,176
Yeah, see, there's her business right there.

42
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,481
And there's some more
of her business right there.

43
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,782
For real, man, you gotta be
the dumbest graduate NU ever produced.

44
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,483
That's okay, baby, I get sick before I fly, too.

45
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,721
Just take a couple of aspirin.
You'll be all right.

46
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,459
I'm sorry, sir,
but you'll have to deflate your doll.

47
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,532
Yeah, it was worth a shot, right?

48
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,132
Gentlemen, I have two words for you.

49
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,935
Show girls.

50
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,738
For the record, showgirls is one word.

51
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,078
Where...

52
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,544
Does he have to come?

53
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,842
I can't...

54
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,390
I see you've discovered
Commandment Number Eight.

55
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,932
- Yes, I have.
- "Thou shalt not steal."

56
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:10,263
"All forms of entertainment
must include sexual explicitness...

57
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,031
"andlor illegality." That's nice.

58
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,661
Well, Jaime Pressly.

59
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,607
I'd be her bitch any day.

60
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,609
- One second. What're you talking about?
- Bachelor Party Ten Commandments.

61
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:19,872
This is very important.

62
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,471
This has been passed down
from brother to brother in my family.

63
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,641
And from uncle to uncle before that. Ready?

64
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,317
Commandment Number One:

65
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,650
"Everything that happens
during the Bachelor Party Weekend...

66
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,814
"can never be discussed
with anyone else for any reason."

67
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,324
Yeah, don't worry. Lisa already told me,
she doesn't wanna know a thing.

68
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,452
That girl is so cool, she's almost a guy.

69
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,019
You realize what this means, right?

70
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,922
- What?
- Lisa gave you the green light.

71
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,294
What green light?

72
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,369
Dude, don't get all riled up, okay?
I mean, I already promised her...

73
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,599
I'm not gonna get arrested,
and I'm not gonna have sex.

74
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,001
- All I heard was she doesn't know a thing...
- All right, Commandment Number Two:

75
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,806
"The goal of the Bachelor Party Weekend...

76
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,245
"is to experience the most
unforgettable 48 hours ever imagined."

77
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,481
- Count on it.
- And Number Three:

78
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,985
"The Bachelor Party Weekend
must take place in Las Vegas."

79
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,520
Final boarding call
for Flight 420 to Las Vegas.

80
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,682
All ticketed passengers
should proceed to the gate immediately.

81
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,316
Shit. Where's Johnny C?

82
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,861
Is there a reason you're carrying handcuffs?

83
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,897
I'm going to my first bachelor party.

84
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,363
Not with these, you're not.

85
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,528
- But the...
- And what is this?

86
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,005
Oh, dude, banana-flavored
penis-sensitizing cream.

87
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,702
It magnifies even the slightest touch.

88
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,268
You know what I'm talking about.

89
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,813
Best part though, edible.

90
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,510
Not in US airspace it's not.

91
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,184
How do I explain this to you?

92
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,016
This is potentially the biggest weekend...

93
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,185
my friends and I are ever gonna experience.

94
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,525
Do you understand what that means?

95
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,762
These are potentially dangerous weapons...

96
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,837
which you will not be carrying
on any aircraft.

97
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,270
Do you understand what that means?

98
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,982
Man, fuck Osama bin Laden. Fuck Al-Qaeda.

99
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,208
And fuck every other douche bag
who brought about...

100
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,118
this heightened security bullshit.
You know what I mean?

101
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,021
You know, I can understand them
taking the handcuffs, but the dildos?

102
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,218
They even took the goddamn penis cream.

103
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,659
Excuse me,
but who are we bringing dildos for?

104
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,357
Eli, Chapter 1, Page 1.

105
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,833
Showgirls love dildos. Trust me.

106
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,629
They see guys who brought their own,
and the party is on.

107
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,206
Oh, dude, then as soon as we land,
we have to get dildos.

108
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,733
Relax, man. In Vegas they practically
sell them on every street corner.

109
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,040
How the hell would you know?
You've never even been to Vegas.

110
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,878
We're going to the decadence capital
of the world here, boys.

111
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:42,312
Get ready to push the bounds of decency...

112
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,355
and stretch out our moral codes...

113
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:49,360
because this is going to be the wildest,
craziest weekend of our lives.

114
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,695
- Gifts, for everyone.
- Oh, yeah.

115
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,294
I should say to our new...

116
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,873
Thanks, brother.

117
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,703
Get this party started.

118
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,676
I want you all to know how psyched I am...

119
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,180
that my four best friends are with me.
You know?

120
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,716
- Each of you guys mean the world to me.
- All right.

121
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,981
Enough of this sensitive bullshit.

122
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,180
Before we break out into a circle jerk...

123
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,554
we are going to get shit-faced.

124
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,557
That's right.

125
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,831
Shitty.

126
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,532
All right. I got a question to ask you.

127
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,473
Don't get me wrong,
Lisa's practically perfect.

128
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,806
She's got a great body, she's sexy, she's
smart, she's got a great sense of humor.

129
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,811
According to you,
she's a beast in the sack. Right?

130
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:43,938
But?

131
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,586
Why are you willing to reduce
an entire decade of male bonding...

132
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,816
which is supposed to be our 20's,
to one weekend?

133
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,960
- You mean, why am I getting married?
- Yes! Why?

134
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,462
Why now?
Why can't you wait until you're, like...

135
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:02,964
30 or 35 or 40?

136
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,536
What's the rush?

137
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,005
I love her.

138
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,940
Okay. And?

139
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,844
What else is there?

140
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,369
Oh.

141
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,214
Well, that's... That's bullshit.

142
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,283
You don't... Great, you love her.

143
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:26,046
- That's fine, though. You owe us, though.
- What do you mean, I owe you?

144
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,424
Look, dude, don't get us wrong, okay?
We're incredibly happy for you.

145
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,928
It's just that we're getting used to the idea...

146
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,897
that you're gonna be Lisa's
for the rest of your life.

147
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,599
For one last weekend, bitch, you're ours.

148
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,329
- It's the bachelor dilemma.
- What is?

149
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:41,406
Going into his final weekend
as a single man...

150
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:45,469
every bachelor feels
a torn sense of obligation.

151
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,638
See, he wants to stay true
to his bride-to-be and not let her down.

152
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:53,276
While, at the same time, staying true
to his friends and not letting them down.

153
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,521
- Where did you learn that, psych class?
- Hustler.

154
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,852
Of course.

155
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,731
Another round, gentlemen?

156
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,267
Oh, that's perfect. Here, right...
You can just drop it right...

157
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,930
Thank you so much.
Here's $50, keep it coming.

158
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,564
- Consider it done.
- Okay.

159
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,676
Drink up, boys.

160
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,843
Sobriety is the enemy.

161
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,439
Hey, do you have
that DVD player I gave you?

162
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,684
- Yeah.
- All right.

163
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,453
The in-flight entertainment
is about to begin.

164
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:37,090
Excuse me, ma'am.
Would you mind switching seats?

165
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:42,357
Young man, every time I fly to Las Vegas,
I sit in 27-C.

166
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,627
It's my lucky seat.

167
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,705
- I'm not gonna give that up.
- Please? Pretty please?

168
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,008
This is my seat.

169
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,176
Buzz off.

170
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,338
All right. If that's what you'd like.

171
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,816
What the hell is this?
I gave him this to watch porn.

172
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,183
That's Chuck Liddell.

173
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:07,419
The Iceman is the UFC
Light Heavyweight Champion of the World.

174
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,389
He's, like,
the most dangerous man on the planet.

175
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,056
Okay, well, unless we see him getting
a blow job from a ring girl...

176
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,861
I think this is the last time
we're gonna see Iceman this weekend.

177
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,730
- There you go.
- Very nice.

178
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,896
Gentlemen, I present Miss Candy Juggs.
All right.

179
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,238
- Turn it on. Play.
- Pow.

180
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,206
- Yeah.
- Right there, right there.

181
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,650
- Oh, yeah, don't stop.
- Got you.

182
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,207
Your cock is so big.

183
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,548
Sorry, ma'am, I tried to warn you.

184
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,613
Would you mind turning that off?

185
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,420
You know, under normal circumstances,
I absolutely would...

186
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,893
but Bachelor Party
Commandment Number Eight...

187
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,361
Would you like to see my pussy?

188
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,019
Excuse me?

189
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,595
Would you like to see my pussy?

190
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,264
God, no!

191
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,238
I don't care to see your pornography.

192
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,341
I like mine with a little story.

193
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,980
So, if I have to see yours,
I'm gonna show you mine.

194
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,044
- Give it back.
- No.

195
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,983
Trust. Trust. Just no.

196
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,354
Oh, God, I need...

197
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,755
So, guys...

198
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,230
in the spirit of this weekend...

199
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,928
I've decided to do something
completely out of character.

200
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,899
Take a look at the newest member
of the Mile High Club.

201
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,803
Oh, Eli...

202
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,867
spanking doesn't count.

203
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,644
What do you mean, it doesn't count?

204
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,375
Sorry, Eli, I'm afraid it doesn't.

205
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,484
I wanna go home.

206
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,110
Right now.

207
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,186
Whoever just masturbated in the bathroom...

208
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,158
would you mind going back
and cleaning your man-sauce off the mirror?

209
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,322
Did he just say "man-sauce"?

210
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,321
Please.

211
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,894
Won't be going to the bathroom
any time soon.

212
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,872
There it is, guys.
The most beautiful city in the world.

213
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,980
Oh, man.

214
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,379
You know, most women dream
of their wedding day their entire lives.

215
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,615
But this is the day we dream of.

216
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,851
It's even more beautiful than I thought.

217
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,821
We're here.

218
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,190
We're really here.

219
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,959
Oh, my God, that's the girl
from Poison Ivy 3, Jaime Pressly.

220
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,761
- It's Jaime Pressly.
- Jaime.

221
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,459
- Jaime.
- Miss Pressly, excuse me.

222
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,198
Hey, this is my buddy
Nathan's last weekend as a single man...

223
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,866
and I was kind of wondering if maybe
there was something, you know, that...

224
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,569
We could do to help make this
a great weekend?

225
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,669
- Yes.
- Right.

226
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,838
- Anything at all.
- Right. You know what?

227
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,746
- I'm sure there's something we could do.
- Yeah, definitely.

228
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,839
All right?

229
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,580
Yeah. Why don't I get...

230
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,846
- Hi.
- Hi.

231
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,950
Why don't I get your number?

232
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,852
Or your number.

233
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,425
- Okay? And then we'll call you.
- Yeah, I'll give you the number.

234
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,430
847-555-6634. That's 847...

235
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,965
Okay, hold it. Okay, I got it.
I got it that time. Thanks.

236
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,230
- And the name?
- Z Bob. Or Z for short.

237
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,599
Oh, I hope so.

238
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:43,163
Perfect. All right, well, we got it.
So we will give you guys a call.

239
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,572
- So we'Il...
- My name is Ash...

240
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,803
- by the way, just in case, you know.
- Hi. Hi, Ash.

241
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,312
Where you guys staying?

242
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,347
- We are staying at...
- Green Valley.

243
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,407
- Green Valley Ranch.
- That's an awesome hotel.

244
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,849
Yeah. Maybe Caesars or maybe...
We're not... We're not sure.

245
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,220
- What's up with your friend? Hi.
- Hi. That's Jenna. You know...

246
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,282
- have a wonderful trip.
- Yeah.

247
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,690
- Congratulations. And...
- Thank you.

248
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,456
...we'll call you. Good luck.
- We'll see you at Caesars.

249
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,997
We're at the Nugget. All right.

250
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,827
- Nice to meet you, Jaime Pressly.
- I love you.

251
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,091
It was nice to meet you...

252
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,226
- Wow!
...Jaime Pressly.

253
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,336
Shut up.

254
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,406
- Jaime Pressly is gonna call us.
- No, she's not.

255
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,441
- No, no, she will. I know she will.
- No, not in a million years.

256
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,442
- You think she's just leading us on?
- Yes.

257
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,444
At least she was nice about it, right?

258
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,605
- Jaime!
- Probably a lesbian, anyway.

259
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,206
God, I hope so.

260
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,921
Oh, yeah! You are the man! Sweet!

261
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,898
Guys, let's get ready to rock 'n roll!

262
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,934
Guys, the first lap dance, it's on me.

263
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,595
Get ready boys. The weekend starts now.

264
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,450
Ma'am, excuse me.

265
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:05,446
- You weren't on the Web site.
- That's 'cause I just started.

266
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,259
I am Cassandra.

267
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,388
I also teach preschool.

268
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:17,902
Never, ever trust the pictures
you see on a Web site.

269
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,506
- Humpity-humpity dump.
- Okay. Whoa, stop.

270
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,875
Please, really stop.

271
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,244
Okay.
Do you want me to take it to the next level?

272
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,215
Oh, yeah.

273
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,547
Help me.

274
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,110
- No.
- Help me. Help me.

275
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,617
Oh, God! Oh, God!

276
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,752
- Oh, baby. Oh, you are so hot.
- Yeah.

277
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,558
Oh, you are so hot.

278
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,863
Baby. What a penis!

279
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,270
Oh, you have a genius penis.

280
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,274
Okay! You know what? Stop it.

281
00:17:56,341 --> 00:18:00,175
Just stop. Okay? Just stop right now.
Just stop. Okay?

282
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,075
I wanted... I didn't wanna say anything but...

283
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,716
I'm gay.

284
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,981
Yes, I'm gay. I'm gay, girl.

285
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,681
Cassandra, you don't understand.

286
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,484
You know what, I'm not gonna tempt you.

287
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,092
- I'll move right along.
- Yeah.

288
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,288
Hi. Do you wanna do the humpity-dump...

289
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:22,026
the whip or there's the nose suck?

290
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,026
No, I'll just take the humpity...

291
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,334
You know what?
Cassandra, I'm actually gay, too.

292
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,703
- Really gay.
- I thought for sure he was the boyfriend.

293
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,771
- It's me.
- Moving on. I'm gonna move right on.

294
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,215
Okey-dokey.

295
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,315
- Hi.
- Hey. What's up, honey?

296
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,417
So, me, his boyfriend? No.

297
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,724
Actually, I'm more man
than you ever thought possible.

298
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,794
Okay, if you say so.

299
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,627
Hi, little fella.

300
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:59,333
Let's see if you can stand up straight
for Mama. Don't be a bad boy.

301
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,437
Stop. Ouch.

302
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,865
Listen, honey, I'm his boyfriend.

303
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,578
- You two-timing little slut.
- You're gay, too?

304
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,680
- Power gay.
- Girl, you all just relax.

305
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:14,875
Well...

306
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,815
I know there's one guy
on this bus who likes girls.

307
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,815
It's Cassandra.

308
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,296
- Yeah.
- And I saved my best for last.

309
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,660
It's my monkey routine,
and you're the banana.

310
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,711
No. Oh, god!

311
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,739
Where is Vegas?

312
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,137
Not that I'm complaining,
but where the hell are we?

313
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,700
Each of us is in charge
of one part of this weekend.

314
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,905
I've arranged for a little outdoor fun.

315
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,813
Isn't this great?

316
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,386
Wait.

317
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,388
You brought us all the way
out here to play paintball?

318
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,453
Yeah.

319
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:38,162
All right, I have to get your release forms
before I can let you out on the playing field.

320
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,965
- You sure you want the special?
- Hell, yeah.

321
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,506
Wait. What's the special?

322
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,464
Chrissy!

323
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:55,283
Boys, I'd like you to meet Chrissy.

324
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,049
She is the special.

325
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,817
All right now,
Chrissy here gets a two-minute head start...

326
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,555
and you have the privilege
of hunting this fine young filly.

327
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,390
Excuse me. We what, sir?

328
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,462
The first one of you
who can claim a kill shot...

329
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,627
gets me alone for an hour.

330
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,964
You can do anything you want to me...

331
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:17,869
with me...

332
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,011
- Wow.
...or for me.

333
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,071
That's what I'm talking about.

334
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,342
Only if you get a kill shot. On your mark.

335
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,747
- Get set.
- Down, baby, she's mine.

336
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,144
Go!

337
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,086
God damn.

338
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,825
Is it just me, or does anybody else
think this is a little strange?

339
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,259
Well, you could just stay here with me
if you'd prefer.

340
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,579
I'm a bad motherfucker.

341
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,004
Yeah!

342
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,911
Get some! Get some!

343
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,246
Get some!

344
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,214
Yo! This is just like my favorite
Candy Juggs video.

345
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,519
- Where do you think I got the idea from?
- You have that video, too?

346
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,456
No, I stole it from you. Get some!

347
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:15,625
Hey. We're never gonna find her like this.
Let's spread out or something.

348
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,165
All right, cool.
You guys go that way, fox formation.

349
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,897
I'm heading this way. Let's go.

350
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,142
Guys. Guys, wait...

351
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,883
You guys. Guys.

352
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,488
- Don't shoot. You win.
- Damn straight.

353
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,190
Why'd you do that?

354
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,765
Hey, now I got one question.

355
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,002
Do I have to split the hour
with the bachelor...

356
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,632
or do I get to have you all to myself?

357
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:57,809
What...

358
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,244
I love doing that.

359
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,008
You are rough, little girl.

360
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,707
You're a little rough, huh?
You're a rough one.

361
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,377
- You see both of them?
- Who's that? Who are you?

362
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,047
- I'm Chrissy's twin, Missy.
- Oh, yeah.

363
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,248
I rock.

364
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,517
I rock. I rock.

365
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,394
- That's all there is to it. I rock.
- Clothes off.

366
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,657
- What?
- They both have guns now.

367
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,097
- Yes, okay.
- Both of you.

368
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,691
That's all you gotta say to me.

369
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,167
- You need to start taking your...
- I have a very bad...

370
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,237
Now!

371
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,306
- She shot me. It hurt.
- Okay, that's great.

372
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,204
- Start taking your clothes off.
- I have a very, very bad...

373
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,243
Listen to me! Listen to me. All right?

374
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,610
We are in the middle of the desert
with two hot chicks. All right?

375
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:40,717
And we are about to get naked.
What could possibly go wrong?

376
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,820
What could possibly go wrong?

377
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,692
What the hell?

378
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,162
My dick! The bitch shot my dick!

379
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,056
- Twins.
- Where?

380
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,864
Twins with guns!

381
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,255
- I am never forgiving you for this.
- Shut up, you.

382
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,198
Ash, I gotta hand it to you.
That was awesome.

383
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,126
Are you guys okay?

384
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,605
Does it look like we're okay?

385
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:35,995
I need weed!

386
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:39,770
Guys, come on, come on.
I got exactly what you need.

387
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,075
Come on in the bus. Let's hurry, hurry.

388
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,945
Cassandra to the rescue.

389
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,176
- Cassandra to the rescue.
- Sorry.

390
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,048
What?

391
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,694
Oh, lucky us. Our driver is wearing a thong.

392
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,330
Isn't that the same one
Cassandra was wearing?

393
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:06,767
Oh, yeah. Work it, Ted. Work it.
Yes, work it, Ted!

394
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,066
Come on!

395
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:13,434
Oh, Ted. Oh, go, Ted. Go.

396
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:14,972
No.

397
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:20,814
Oh, God! Oh, God! Please stop.
Please, I'm begging you.

398
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,150
Oh, God, I can feel your balls on my knees.

399
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:26,247
Hey, Commandment Number Nine:
"No matter what goes wrong...

400
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,451
"all participants must persevere."

401
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,797
Blow, Ted, blow.

402
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,197
I think I'm gonna be sick. Yup.

403
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,062
Oh, no you don't.

404
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,400
You were just saying how you wanted to,
you know, push the bounds of decency...

405
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,973
and stretch out our moral code. Remember?

406
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,133
I never said that.

407
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,005
I would be glad to stretch you out, big boy.

408
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,272
You know what?
I'm stretched out all I wanna be, thank you.

409
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,008
Didn't you say you wanted to experience
the wildest and craziest...

410
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,209
bachelor party of your life?

411
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:58,248
You know, this isn't the kind
of wild and crazy I meant.

412
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,383
Push it back, push it back, way back.

413
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,653
I see where you wanna take it.

414
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:06,094
You wanna take this to the next level, huh,
don't you?

415
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,892
No! Oh, God, not the next level!

416
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,458
Oh, I am going right off the road.

417
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,970
I need weed! I need...
Don't fucking touch me!

418
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,030
I need weed!

419
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:20,202
All right, dude, chill out. I get it.
Why didn't you just say so?

420
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,770
You got weed?

421
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,647
Blow.

422
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,786
Oh, yeah. Okay.

423
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,450
No, no.

424
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:39,964
- No means no. No means no, thank you.
- So when'd you start smoking, player?

425
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,293
- Two minutes ago.
- All right.

426
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,872
- Hello.
- Hi, Mommy.

427
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,204
- Hi, sweetie.
- Are you busy?

428
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,937
Yeah, I'm at work.

429
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:57,114
You know what they say.
There's no weed like gay weed.

430
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,648
- Who says that?
- They do.

431
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,889
Stop acting stupid.
Don't fucking hit me again, all right?

432
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,894
Wait a second.
You guys aren't gay, are you?

433
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:16,328
You know, I'm sure if we weren't,
we would be.

434
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,025
Okay, I gotta go. Okay.
Love you, too, sweetie. I'll be back...

435
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,867
to check on you. Okay, bye.

436
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,810
Stretch it out, stretch it out, way out.

437
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,610
Look at you.

438
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,979
Listen, guys.
I totally get what's going on here. Okay?

439
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,645
Cassie wasn't doing it for you guys.
It happens sometimes.

440
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,745
Let me just tell you,
she's like a little sister to me.

441
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,450
And if she found out,
it would totally break her heart.

442
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,857
- So she won't.
- Thanks.

443
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,120
I got it. Check this out.

444
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:51,296
What's up, Captain Crunch?
I'll have a bowl of that.

445
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,537
Oh, yeah, nice.

446
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,075
Yeah. Give me some of that big gay dick.

447
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,977
Yo, Teddy. Teddy.

448
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,346
I wanna blow you.

449
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,609
I wanna blow you.

450
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,152
Oh, I am getting so hot...

451
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,557
thinking of all those penises together.

452
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,422
Ted! Break out the gerbils!

453
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,557
Baby, break out the gerbils!

454
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:23,726
Gerbil?

455
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:28,364
I wanna feel his whiskers in my ass. Yeah.
I wanna feel him crawling around...

456
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:32,432
scratching around, little claws.
Yeah, little noses, I want them up my ass.

457
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:37,481
Oh, I want a whole fucking rodent family
up my prolapsed anus, Ted!

458
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,777
Oh, God.

459
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,647
What?

460
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,221
All right, my friends,
the past is but prologue.

461
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,026
The real bachelor party
is now about to begin.

462
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:11,680
I'm gonna win about $1 million
out of all of this shit. All of this shit.

463
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,778
We're really here.

464
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:21,619
Hey, I am gonna win $25,000
on that one and...

465
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,684
Oh, my God.

466
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,559
Please tell me I'm not hallucinating.

467
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,064
What's up, Z... Jesus Christ.

468
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,624
Where do women like that come from?

469
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:36,806
So, which one of you handsome studs
happens to be Z Bob?

470
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,711
That would be me.

471
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,748
Your party planner asked me
to escort you upstairs.

472
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:48,047
- Won't you all, please, follow me?
- You really think I'm handsome, huh?

473
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,485
- Let's do this.
- Calm it down.

474
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,628
Hey, you guys,
I think we're going to the penthouse.

475
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,028
- Yeah.
- Nothing but the best.

476
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:05,058
You boys have hired the best
bachelor party planner in Las Vegas.

477
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,865
Possibly the world.

478
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,132
Excuse me, ma'am.

479
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,410
Can I ask you a question?

480
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,639
- Ask her.
- Anything you want.

481
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,614
Is "showgirls" one word or is it two?

482
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:20,946
Oh, Eli.

483
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,479
One.

484
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,524
See? See? You're an idiot.

485
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,123
Can I ask you boys something?

486
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,126
Anything.

487
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,560
Anything you want.

488
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,500
Did any of you happen to bring a dildo
with you?

489
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,633
Wait.

490
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,972
What? What did you just say?
What did you say?

491
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:52,210
'Cause I just have this crazy urge
to do a dildo show for you.

492
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:55,446
I told you.

493
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,385
Chapter 1, Page 1, right there.

494
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:01,551
- I guess it'll just have to wait.
- I knew it.

495
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:05,094
Man, fuck Osama bin Laden.

496
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,427
- Here they come.
- Hi.

497
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,866
Cocktails?

498
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,003
Thank you.

499
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:19,240
Hey, you guys, I may have screwed up
a lot of things in the last four years...

500
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,108
but this weekend will not be one of them.

501
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:26,015
This? These are all for us?

502
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,789
This is nice.

503
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,255
Hey, guys. Allow me to introduce myself.

504
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,591
My name is Carmine T. Angelo.

505
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:42,565
And I am
the ultimate bachelor party planner...

506
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,862
at your service.

507
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,232
What happened to Mr. Kidd?

508
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:49,170
Mr. Kidd?
Mr. Kidd was unavoidably detained...

509
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,442
due to a prior engagement.

510
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,338
God damn.

511
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,607
You the bachelor?

512
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,309
- How could you tell?
- Because you're a little nervous.

513
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,441
But, you know, I'm an expert.

514
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:04,487
So which one do you want? Have your pick.

515
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,622
- How do you mean?
- How do I mean?

516
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,487
I mean, you can pick.

517
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,492
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.

518
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,624
One. Just get one at a time.

519
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,329
No, you know what? I'll pick for you.

520
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,638
Penelope.

521
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,213
Come on, I got a little work for you.
Isn't she a doll?

522
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,646
- Huh?
- Which one?

523
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,240
This guy, right here.

524
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,309
- He's cute.
- Oh, dear God.

525
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:46,519
- You and I are gonna have some fun tonight.
- Hold that.

526
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:50,192
My man. Don't let me down, man.

527
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,600
I think somebody needs a nurse.
Who needs a nurse?

528
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,672
I'm feeling kind of sick.

529
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:11,414
Look, you're really beautiful
and everything but...

530
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,021
I want you.

531
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,826
Okay, guys. These are the rules.

532
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,731
You can look, but you cannot touch.

533
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,731
Only the bachelor gets full service
on Night One.

534
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:31,132
But don't worry, you guys will get yours
when your friends arrive tomorrow night.

535
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:35,474
Tonight is all about the bachelor,
and you guys going out on the town.

536
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:39,945
I've got dinner reservations for you guys
at Drai's, tickets to the big fight...

537
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,249
and a backstage pass
to meet my very dear, personal friend...

538
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,913
Mr. Wayne Newton.

539
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,424
Did you just say Wayne Newton?

540
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,257
No, I said Fig Newton.

541
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,127
We have backstage passes
to see Wayne Newton? In person?

542
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,166
That's what I said.
Let me ask you something.

543
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,759
You're a little drunk there. Are you 21?
You gotta be 21 to go...

544
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,838
- You're goddamn right, I'm 21, sir.
- Okay. Good for you.

545
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,906
You are goddamn right.
I am meeting that man.

546
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,133
Okay, wait, wait, wait. No.

547
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:11,078
Oh, well,
you don't wanna disappoint your friends.

548
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,676
Do you?

549
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,313
Holy shit.

550
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:25,692
You don't really think he's actually
doing anything with her, do you?

551
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,731
I sure the hell hope so.

552
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,805
Yeah?

553
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,850
Then, depending what you guys
are in the mood for...

554
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,288
I've got you on the VIP list
at Light, Whiskey Bar...

555
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,582
and The Emperor's Club
at The Crazy Horse Too...

556
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,093
for a private lap dance.

557
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,093
Look. I can't.

558
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,528
Sure you can.

559
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,767
No, really.

560
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,632
Look, I'm sorry.

561
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:15,344
You're the hottest woman
that's ever wanted to have sex with me...

562
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,040
but I just can't.

563
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,485
You really love your fiancée
that much, huh?

564
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,056
That much and then some.

565
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,156
Well, more power to you.

566
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,630
Then what about your friends?

567
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:39,630
And now, to get the night started off right,
here are some house chips...

568
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,261
for you guys to gamble with.

569
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:44,374
- What are house chips?
- Well, you play them just like regular chips...

570
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,139
but you don't cash them in
until you play them at least once.

571
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:52,338
Go to Table Four, Pit Five.
Just don't draw too much attention.

572
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:57,142
More! Nathan, give me more!

573
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,082
A little word of advice, boys.

574
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,683
Always leave them begging for more.

575
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,224
Let's go gamble.

576
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,131
All right, Nathan!

577
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,043
Bachelor! Bachelor!

578
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,240
Man, right there, the Statue of Liberty.

579
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,012
"Drop it like it's hot." Oh, my God!

580
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,985
Oh, my God!

581
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,824
- He's blowing!
- That's what I'm talking about.

582
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:40,989
Easy.

583
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,793
Next, John. Next, John.

584
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,603
I'm gonna put $2,000 on a hard eight.

585
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,837
- Are you with me?
- Yeah, baby.

586
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,313
This one's from Johnny C, from you to me.

587
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:09,084
This is for you.

588
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,319
Thank you!

589
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,591
Eli! Eli! Eli!

590
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,793
That works. That works, baby. That works.

591
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,839
Throw the dice.

592
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,777
Oh, my God!

593
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,245
Oh, my God!

594
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,470
Oh, hello, love.

595
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,710
Pass it down. Take one down.

596
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:36,218
- Pass it around.
- All right, we're taking a time out.

597
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,620
- Gentlemen.
- You know I love you guys, for real.

598
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,756
Yeah, baby.

599
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,325
All right. Let me get that on a...

600
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,961
Gentlemen. Gather up your chips
and come with us, please.

601
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,829
I think we're about to find out how
the high rollers get treated, boys. Let's go.

602
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,310
Ladies, have fun. To the house.

603
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,243
Fuck.

604
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,787
- You know...
- Take it easy, guys.

605
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,186
- Here's your $50.
- Yeah.

606
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,518
Let's go.

607
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,120
- Hey, sir.
- Shut your mouth.

608
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,026
- But, sir, you told me that...
- What did I just say? I ought to put this...

609
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:22,088
out in your fucking ear. What did I just say?

610
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,925
Answer me or, I swear to God,
I'll rip your fucking head off...

611
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,504
and use your neck for an ashtray.

612
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,699
But, sir, first you tell me to shut my mouth,
then you tell me to answer you.

613
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,266
- lf I do one, I can't do the other.
- It's a quandary. There is no right answer.

614
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,279
It's a test of character,
and you failed, you moron.

615
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,647
- Okay, boys, now it's your turn.
- Our turn for what?

616
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,284
Let me tell you something.
I'm gonna give you one chance...

617
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,721
to come clean with me,
and then we're going old school, okay?

618
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,349
We have no idea what you're talking about.

619
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,792
You know, God damn it!
You have the fucking nerve...

620
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,830
to come into my joint, rip me off,
and then you come into my office...

621
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:55,789
and you lie to me to my face?

622
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,198
Sir, we really have no idea
what you're talking about.

623
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,862
We're not lying, and we definitely
wouldn't try and steal from you.

624
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:01,995
- Oh, yeah? Yeah?
- No.

625
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,698
Let me show you something, guys.

626
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,776
- You see this? You see these?
- Yeah.

627
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,277
These are real chips. You see that?

628
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,014
These are the chips that you started with.

629
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,011
We didn't know, okay?
They were given to us.

630
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,578
- By who?
- Carmine T. Angelo...

631
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,884
- the Bachelor Party Planner.
- Carmine T. Angelo.

632
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:20,946
Who?

633
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,016
He's a friend of Mr. Kidd.
I'm sure you've heard of him.

634
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,063
Yeah, I've heard of him. He's a legend
in this town, except one little problem.

635
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,188
He died two days ago.

636
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,357
You wanna come up with another story?
Wanna try again?

637
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,525
He's dead?

638
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,195
- Get out of here.
- It's not a story. Sir, we...

639
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,967
- Can you call Penthouse 17, please?
- Yeah, just talk to him.

640
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,269
We'll be cool. We'll be fine.

641
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:40,571
This is not our fault.

642
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,579
- Look, it's your fault.
- Shut up.

643
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:43,973
Eli. Eli.

644
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,211
- You're just gonna have to chill.
- Eli. Eli.

645
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,549
Eli, will you shut the fuck up
for five seconds?

646
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,885
We used counterfeit chips
in a casino in Las Vegas.

647
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,187
There's nobody in Penthouse 17.

648
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,986
And there's no Carmine T. Angelo
registered anywhere in the hotel.

649
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,655
Get the fuck out of here, man.

650
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,756
Why in the hell did I put you in charge
of this weekend?

651
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,130
- Listen to me.
- Why?

652
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,362
Please. I'm not lying, okay.
We were there an hour ago.

653
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,903
Wait. Look. That's him!

654
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,963
- Hey. That's him! Right there! Look.
- That's the guy.

655
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,041
That's Carmine.

656
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,840
- That is Carmine T. Angelo right there.
- That guy?

657
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,775
- That guy? That's the guy you met?
- Yeah.

658
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,874
That guy?
His real name is Dominic Calcutta.

659
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,881
He's one of the world's most wanted
casino thieves.

660
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,012
- What?
- What?

661
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,556
Oh, wonderful.

662
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,524
- We have a code red. Calcutta.
- Casino thieves.

663
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,786
Stay calm.

664
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,091
- Pit Five, Table Four. I'm on my way.
- We gonna...

665
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,689
Listen, these guys might be working
with Calcutta.

666
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,824
No.

667
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,392
If they try to leave,
I want you to gut them like fucking pigs...

668
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:43,735
and take these counterfeit chips and
shove them right up their long intestines.

669
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:46,241
Sir, sir, sir. We're not working with Calcutta.

670
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,141
We're not working with anybody.

671
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,345
Okay, I'm sorry,
but we're gonna get out of this.

672
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,713
Hey, it's not your fault, huh?
How could you have known that...

673
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,150
you hired a notorious casino robber
to plan my bachelor party?

674
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,244
Shit.

675
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:01,052
- This is my fault.
- Yeah, it is. Your fault again.

676
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:04,386
And the rest of us,
we're not gonna forgive you, bro.

677
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,657
- Never, never again.
- Look, chill, okay?

678
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,890
- Never again.
- Eli!

679
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,398
Calm down, bro.

680
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,833
Hey, don't forget
Commandment Number Seven:

681
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:16,305
"No matter what goes wrong,
all participants must persevere."

682
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,498
Number Nine.

683
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:21,635
- Yeah. And don't forget it.
- Well, what do you suggest we do, huh?

684
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,074
Well...

685
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,139
there's five of us, right?

686
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:30,077
And there's only two of them.
I say we take them.

687
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,482
Good plan. Any other ideas?

688
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,424
- Oh, God! Oh, my God! Look!
- We better go check this out.

689
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,052
- What is that?
- Oh, my God.

690
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,186
Tell me what that is.

691
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,595
This is not good.
You guys, this is not good.

692
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,996
Oh, my God.

693
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,268
- Eli.
- Did you do that?

694
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:46,836
No! Eli, calm down.

695
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:50,067
- Eli, shut the fuck up!
- Guess who got us into this, too.

696
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,208
The door is locked.

697
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:52,871
Hey, guys.

698
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:56,739
Go, go, go, go.

699
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,090
Coming through.

700
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:27,900
It's locked.

701
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,309
It's not an exit.

702
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,188
Hey, what's the hurry? Your wife want you?

703
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,922
Somebody needs to clean this shit up.

704
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,091
No, no, no! My soufflé!

705
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,975
Watch out!

706
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,505
Slow down!

707
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,444
Man, how do we get out of here?

708
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,518
No, no. That way! That way! That way!

709
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,977
- We need to find transportation.
- Now.

710
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:44,820
Any of you guys interested in joining
our friend's last weekend as a bachelorette?

711
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,115
- Is this a great town or what?
- Yes, yes, we are.

712
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,488
Get in.

713
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:56,631
So you're, like, getting married, too.

714
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,834
That is just so... Yeah.

715
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:07,075
Does your fiancée do things for you?

716
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:09,372
Like?

717
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:13,848
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, she's amazing.

718
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,544
But does she do the...

719
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,752
naughty things?

720
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:26,219
- We really appreciate the ride.
- Oh, you will. Believe me.

721
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,326
Yeah.

722
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:36,299
- Any of you guys thirsty?
- Fuck, yeah.

723
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,600
Thanks.

724
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,739
That's special beer.

725
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,806
What's special beer?

726
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,846
It's beer mixed with Ecstasy.

727
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:52,213
We call it Ecstasy Beer.

728
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,155
Clever name.

729
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,151
So...

730
00:44:57,294 --> 00:45:01,924
being that this is our best friend's
last weekend as a single woman and all...

731
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,232
we were wondering if you'd...

732
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:06,466
you know.

733
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:08,898
You know, what?

734
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,174
Show us your dicks.

735
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:18,237
- That'd be no.
- Oh, come on. Why not?

736
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,643
Oh, because...

737
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,514
- Because why?
- Yeah, why?

738
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,483
What do you mean, why?

739
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:28,150
- Will it really make you happy?
- Oh, yes.

740
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:32,826
Now will you be able to go home,
get married, live happily ever after...

741
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,420
- No, no.
...with the knowledge that...

742
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:37,763
complete and total strangers
have showed you their penis?

743
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,993
Yes!

744
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,799
"To varying degrees of public humiliation...

745
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,896
- "during the Bachelor Party weekend."
- No way, I'm not doing it.

746
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,998
You're doing it, man.
Nobody's chickening out.

747
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,476
Come on, you dirty bitch, let's do this.

748
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,046
We're gonna drop trou on three,
you guys, ready?

749
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,174
- All right, come on, fuck this.
- On three, boys.

750
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,947
Come on. Come on, fucker!
We're showing cock.

751
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,920
- Yes!
- We're showing cock!

752
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,116
My God, this is so wrong. So wrong.

753
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,556
One.

754
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,693
This is so wrong.

755
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,096
This is so wrong.

756
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,324
Two.

757
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,591
Forgive me.

758
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,631
- Two and a half.
- Oh!

759
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,376
Three, two, one!

760
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,121
- What's so freaking funny?
- What?

761
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,525
Wow. Awesome.

762
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,659
Thanks so much, you guys.

763
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:46,829
Bye, Tiny.

764
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:51,631
Bye.

765
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,367
Did you see those little things?

766
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,636
Those were the smallest wieners
I've ever seen.

767
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:01,447
Can't believe
they were dissing our Johnsons.

768
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:05,420
- Fat girls are dissing our Johnsons.
- Fat, wasted girls.

769
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,855
- That's it.
- What's it?

770
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:12,759
They're wasted. The alcohol
and the Ecstasy, it distorts their vision.

771
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:15,690
Look at me. Look at me.

772
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,398
Don't I look smaller to you?

773
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:23,071
- Don't I look smaller than I do in real life?
- I guess. Whoa.

774
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,108
- Dude, seriously.
- I guess.

775
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,111
Okay, then, that's it.
It wasn't us, it was them.

776
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:31,707
It was them.

777
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:35,276
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I'm ready to go back to Chicago.

778
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:39,652
No, Nathan. The only place
you're going is where we take you.

779
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,691
- Look, I know you guys mean well, okay?
- Hey.

780
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,157
So we've had a few setbacks.

781
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,695
That's what happens when you put Z Bob
in charge of the weekend.

782
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:48,390
I've got other responsibilities now, okay?
It's like...

783
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:51,798
Not yet you don't. You owe us.

784
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,198
- Guys, seriously.
- Listen to me. Turn around and look.

785
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:56,772
Look. We're here.

786
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:00,239
And we're not leaving this night
or this weekend or any of that shit...

787
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:01,971
until we say we are. All right? Let's go.

788
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,604
- Z's right.
- Excuse me.

789
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,171
Hey.

790
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:10,345
I'm not trying to get with you,
I just love you. All right, that's all.

791
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,149
- Hey, we all love each other.
- Shotgun.

792
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,452
- No shotgun.
- I wanna meet that guy.

793
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:16,224
Who likes the car? Get in the car.

794
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,488
- Wait. Do it smooth. Do it smooth.
- Get him in the car.

795
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,894
Smooth. If you push me in smoothly...

796
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:21,988
- That's better.
...I'll get in.

797
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,191
- You'll take it.
- I love you.

798
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:24,359
I love you.

799
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,996
- Get in the car! Jesus!
- I love you.

800
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,498
Let's roll.

801
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,917
Now I bet you guys were wondering...

802
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:44,283
what my contribution to this weekend
was gonna be.

803
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,555
Gentlemen, we are going to visit a porn set.

804
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,259
Oh, my God,
this is that Hard Entertainment?

805
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:53,523
That Hard Entertainment.

806
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,191
- I have, like, 50 of their videos.
- 50?

807
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,396
Is that a little or a lot?

808
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,931
Hey, stop that right now.

809
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,807
We're not going to just any porn set here.

810
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:08,600
We are gonna watch
Miss Candy Juggs herself.

811
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,838
Oh, my God, I love Candy Juggs, dude!

812
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,438
I love her, too!

813
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,751
- Ash, what are you doing?
- All right, let's do this.

814
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,013
I'm cool!

815
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,249
Fucking hot out this bitch, though, isn't it?

816
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:32,325
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Johnny C.

817
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,128
I'm looking for Harry.

818
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,633
Yeah, well, you're looking right at him.

819
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:43,946
- You're Harry Hard?
- The one and only.

820
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:48,209
Come on, get your asses in here
before I change my mind.

821
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,946
Come on, you sweet little boys, you.
Come on.

822
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:55,817
Venus, you little slut.
I can't believe you started without me.

823
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,426
- I can go home now.
- Cut.

824
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,596
- Get the boom out.
- Which one did you want?

825
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,228
- Doesn't matter. The big...
- Get... Take the camera, will you?

826
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,704
- Which one do you want?
- It doesn't matter to me.

827
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,003
Z, buddy, you're shaking a little bit.

828
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,838
- Where did you get this guy?
- Over there, she...

829
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,172
- Well, let's go.
- I'm gonna have to...

830
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:19,410
Whoa. I'm gonna have to search you
before I let you any closer to the talent.

831
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:23,315
Yeah, sorry about that.
We've had a few incidences recently...

832
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:25,014
and we've had to up security.

833
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,248
Nothing big.

834
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:29,358
You and everybody else.
Arms and legs to the side.

835
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,087
- We're just gonna pat you down.
- Spread them.

836
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,686
We'll pat them down a little bit.
Pat them down. Just a little...

837
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,288
Excuse me, those are my balls, bro.

838
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,764
Just doing my job.

839
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,367
Thank you.

840
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,065
- Nice.
- He stuck his finger in my ass.

841
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:45,699
He could put his entire,
unoiled fist up my ass, for all I care.

842
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,276
- And you...
- Weapons?

843
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:51,145
Big finish, here.
Oh, you like that, don't you, huh?

844
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,605
You smell delicious.

845
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,747
All right, ladies, come here.

846
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:00,881
I wanna introduce you
to some of your biggest fans here.

847
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:02,818
I'm trying to direct a movie here.

848
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,793
You call that directing? This is shit, buddy.

849
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:06,158
This is beautiful.

850
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,926
You're doing a terrible goddamn job.
I could have a chimp do what you're doing.

851
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,628
- Forget it. I quit.
- You quit? Get out of here. You're fired.

852
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:16,763
You can't even work with a dildo.
God damn it, I'll use you as a fucking dildo.

853
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,306
Sorry. Asshole.

854
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:19,703
Where were we?

855
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,607
- Hello, boys.
- Hot.

856
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:28,143
- You're here for a bachelor party. Huh?
- How could you tell...

857
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,015
that we're here for a bachelor party?

858
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:35,015
- I'm a veteran at this.
- Oh, little harder. Little harder.

859
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:39,651
Well, that's new. Really hard.

860
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:44,790
Not that hard. Am I bleeding?

861
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,166
So what would you like...

862
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,671
to watch me do to her first?

863
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,106
Yeah. Or me. You know, I'm available.

864
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,303
I mean, a lot of the guys get off
on that sort of stuff.

865
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,938
I used to do a thing called a three-legged...

866
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:05,278
Oh, shit.

867
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:13,987
- What do you mean, "Oh, shit"?
- Oh, shit.

868
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:21,994
I know you're in there, Candy.
Open the goddamn door!

869
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:25,165
Go away Iceman. Candy ain't here.

870
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:29,037
- I haven't seen her all day.
- Hey, Chuck, that's bullshit.

871
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:35,050
By Iceman, he doesn't mean...

872
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,916
like, the Iceman, Chuck Liddell, does he?

873
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,149
Who the hell do you think he means?

874
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,750
Yeah, you know, maybe you guys
should get the hell out of here.

875
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,853
Yeah, my boyfriend gets a little jealous
if anyone watches.

876
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,955
Your boyfriend is Chuck Liddell?

877
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:58,007
If she's got any visitors,
I'm gonna kill them all.

878
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:01,771
- lf she's got any visitors...
- Yeah, you should probably go that way.

879
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:07,908
Hey, look, I just really wanted to tell you
before we go that I really enjoy your work...

880
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,349
and that I think you're very talented.

881
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,649
And I've jerked off to you like 4,000 times.

882
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:12,813
- You counted.
- Yeah.

883
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:13,981
How sweet.

884
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,758
I warned you about this shit.

885
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:20,891
Look, I just gotta check something
really quickly.

886
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:22,192
I'm done playing.

887
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:25,132
Holy shit, you really do taste like my favorite
breakfast sandwich. Thank you so much.

888
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:49,052
Holy shit, you guys.
It's the beautiful-est thing I've ever seen!

889
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,786
You guys can go and do whatever
the hell it is you wanna do...

890
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,659
but I am going on the next plane
back to Chicago.

891
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,964
- I need water or some type of liquid.
- What the hell is that?

892
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,163
Some type of liquid or something.

893
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:08,906
Wait.

894
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:14,241
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, look at the clown.

895
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:16,251
- I'm sorry I have to do this to you.
- The clown.

896
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,718
- I am sorry.
- What?

897
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:23,617
- You sober?
- That was not cool.

898
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,088
Do it again.

899
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:31,865
- Okay?
- Call me a naughty whore.

900
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:33,968
- I'm joking.
- They're around here somewhere.

901
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:35,299
- I'm ready now.
- Let's go.

902
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:36,463
I'm ready.

903
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:41,341
Wait, no. Here, I know. Step like this. Go.

904
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:42,979
Oh, God.

905
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,380
Here.

906
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,447
There you go. Go.

907
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:47,505
Hurry up.

908
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,919
- Sorry, buddy.
- Oh, man.

909
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,216
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

910
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,952
Come on! They're getting closer!

911
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,325
Oh, God, they're getting closer.

912
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,702
Oh! I knew it.

913
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:15,802
Oh, man, fuck Osama bin Laden.

914
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:18,346
We shouldn't be out in the open like this.
We gotta call a cab.

915
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,508
- No reception.
- Oh, this is gonna be a long walk.

916
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,609
No, not necessarily. Come on.

917
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,853
Oh, we're dead. We're dead.

918
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:27,682
Don't run.

919
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,281
Excuse me.
Do you think that you could give us a ride?

920
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,260
Damn! Boys,
don't be sneaking up on Elvis like that.

921
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:33,522
You're Elvis?

922
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,627
Excuse me, ma'am, is that spaghetti?

923
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:40,192
Of course it is. I'm the world famous
spaghetti-wrestling she-Elvis.

924
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,465
You mean you boys never heard of me?

925
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,375
Hey, you boys hear
a casino got robbed tonight?

926
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,908
- Can't say we have.
- What?

927
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:50,844
- Yeah.
- What? Which one?

928
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,945
The Golden Nugget. You know, The G-Nug.

929
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,211
Bad guys got $5 million, right?

930
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,947
Police captured them,
killed each and every one of them.

931
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:00,649
- $5 million?
- Yeah. Here's the pisser.

932
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:03,385
They didn't recover one red cent
of that cash.

933
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:10,422
- That's him. That's him.
- Oh, shit.

934
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,661
We gotta hide. We gotta hide.

935
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,667
You're Chuck Liddell, the Iceman.

936
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,036
- Spaghetti.
- Yeah.

937
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,399
No.

938
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:25,781
Cover me.

939
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,051
Coast is clear.
You boys can come up for air now.

940
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,587
You know, I sure hate
to do this to you boys...

941
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:37,182
but I'm having
some real bad money problems.

942
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:38,851
You can't be serious.

943
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:44,324
- I am.
- I'm gonna go ahead and say she's serious.

944
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,892
- What're you doing?
- Get out of the truck, empty your pockets.

945
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,232
Fill this bag.

946
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:51,268
- Now!
- All right. Okay.

947
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:52,998
Okay, here, grab my hand.

948
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:57,278
Come on, what do you got?
Money? Cell phones?

949
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:59,975
You want the beads, too?
You want the beads, too?

950
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,573
- In the bag.
- You don't need the...

951
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,644
- Put the beads in the bag!
- My mama gave me these beads.

952
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,712
I put all my change at the vending machine.

953
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,189
- All of it!
- There you go.

954
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,354
- Do it!
- Okay.

955
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,749
She's ready...

956
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:16,023
- Don't shoot me.
- Thank you for your cooperation.

957
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,065
Is this town great or what?

958
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:26,207
That's it! Enough! Okay?

959
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:30,335
What did I do, huh?
What did I do that was so possibly wrong?

960
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,142
Well, you did put Z Bob in charge.

961
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,012
Oh, dude, come on, like it's my fault...

962
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,278
we're being chased around
by some Ultimate Fighter guy?

963
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,252
How could I have possibly known...

964
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:41,620
that Candy Juggs had a jealous boyfriend
who was gonna come and try to kill us?

965
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:43,625
How was I supposed to know
Carmine T. Angelo...

966
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,786
was really Dominic Calcutta,
the casino thief guy?

967
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,193
Well, how was I supposed to know...

968
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,926
that those two twins was gonna jump out...

969
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,433
and shoot me in my ass?

970
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:56,404
No offense, guys, but this is
the worst bachelor party weekend ever.

971
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,867
I guess I gotta get used to the fact that
I'm never gonna be as cool as my brothers.

972
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:04,413
Z Bob, news flash.
Your brothers aren't that cool.

973
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:07,913
With friends like you, hey,
no wonder I'm getting married.

974
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,688
I got spaghetti in my ass.

975
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:21,861
- Right down the crack of my ass.
- Oh, dude.

976
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:28,467
- Go, go!
- Oh, fuck. Okay, go.

977
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,903
There they are. Let's go have some fun.

978
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,911
The door is locked, come on.

979
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:37,947
Dude, come on.

980
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,708
Come on, come on, come on.

981
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:42,877
One more.

982
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:46,277
Close the door.

983
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,521
Check every one of these doors.

984
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,363
They can run, but they can't hide.

985
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,608
- Yeah, they're gone.
- They're gone, Nathan.

986
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,550
You don't know that.
They could still be out there.

987
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:18,978
Come on, dude.

988
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,113
Sorry.

989
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:23,488
Well, you know what?
If they were here, we'd already be dead.

990
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,584
Oh, now what?

991
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:30,224
- It's locked from the outside.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

992
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:34,302
All right, everybody fan out,
and we'll just find the light...

993
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,362
so we can tell what the hell
is going on around here.

994
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,401
Of course.

995
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:46,404
Nathan. You know what, guys? I got this.

996
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:49,044
Excuse me, ladies.

997
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,281
Yeah, you've got it, all right.

998
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:57,851
You okay?

999
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,918
Never better. Thanks.

1000
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,797
Good. Now, look,
there's gotta be another way out.

1001
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,494
Come on.

1002
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,365
Come on, open.

1003
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,938
Open, 'cause I'm Hercules, I'm strong.

1004
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:13,536
Or not.

1005
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:25,079
Look, if you guys don't wanna talk to me
after this weekend, I understand.

1006
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:27,349
What the hell are you talking about, man?

1007
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:30,492
This weekend
and everything else I screwed up.

1008
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,155
I mean, if I were you,
I wouldn't wanna be friends with me, either.

1009
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,491
Well, you're not us.

1010
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:38,796
If we would've stopped being friends
because of something you screwed up...

1011
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:41,996
- we would've done it a long time ago.
- Yeah, but I'm a total loser.

1012
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,396
What am I?

1013
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:49,568
Look, Nathan,
I understand why you're getting married.

1014
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,213
If I were you, I'd do it, too.

1015
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:56,946
Maybe I'm scared I'd never meet my Lisa,
or my half-as-cool-as-Lisa.

1016
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,759
- Maybe I'm scared of being alone.
- Who isn't, bro, you know?

1017
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:08,955
To tell the truth, I've always kind of
expected to end up alone.

1018
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,562
I mean, I'm not the most studly guy
in the universe.

1019
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:17,003
- You're smart though, man. Women like that.
- He's not that smart.

1020
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,097
Well, at least I didn't cheat on my SATs.

1021
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,436
Neither did I.

1022
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,539
Why lie?

1023
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:26,174
Same reason you tried to join
the Mile High Club.

1024
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:28,911
- We all try to be something we're not.
- That did count.

1025
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:30,509
- No.
- You know it did.

1026
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,184
- No.
- It didn't?

1027
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:35,146
You know what?
I have a confession to make.

1028
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,188
I didn't have sex earlier tonight.

1029
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,422
I only pretended to because
I didn't want to disappoint you guys.

1030
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:46,935
You mean to tell us then you didn't even
take the little two fingers downstairs...

1031
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,528
and play with the little bathing suit area?

1032
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,205
- We knew the whole time.
- We did?

1033
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:54,871
Yeah, we did.

1034
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:59,111
But we appreciated the effort,
so we weren't gonna say anything.

1035
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:02,640
You know, maybe this wasn't such
a bad bachelor party weekend after all, huh?

1036
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:05,084
- No, let's be honest. It sucked.
- Okay.

1037
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:10,316
Man, I'm starving.

1038
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:13,894
First thing I'm gonna eat
when we get out of here...

1039
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:17,260
is prime rib, mashed potatoes...

1040
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:21,501
candied yams, smothered with gravy. Yes.

1041
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:26,104
I'm gonna top that. I'm gonna have myself
a gallon of cookie-dough ice cream...

1042
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,704
with a nice big chocolate chip cookie
on top.

1043
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:31,905
- Okay.
- I'm gonna dip it in the cookie dough...

1044
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:34,415
- It's my turn.
- Oh, man, you don't know.

1045
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,915
You don't know.

1046
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:40,183
$0.99 shrimp cocktail,
six tiny little shrimps...

1047
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,816
the little factory-processed ones?

1048
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:47,384
Shrimp.

1049
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:04,608
I may have screwed up
a lot of things in the last four years...

1050
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,148
but this weekend will not be one of them.

1051
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,587
Hey, excuse me. This is my buddy Nathan.

1052
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:15,818
- And it's his last weekend as a single guy.
- Say no more.

1053
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,430
Yes! Yes!

1054
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:28,129
Well, thanks for the great bachelor party.
I'm going home now.

1055
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,462
- You're not going anywhere.
- Yes.

1056
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,575
Oh, no, hey.
Excuse me, why are we shifting to him?

1057
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,837
This is my dream.

1058
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:38,345
All right, the panties,
but can we see what they came off of?

1059
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,245
- Wake up.
- No, don't wake me up.

1060
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:44,912
No. No, I haven't got laid yet. You can't
wake... Don't wake... Don't wake me up.

1061
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,080
Wake up. Wake up.

1062
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:50,384
Come on, wake up.
Get your ass up. Come on.

1063
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,627
Get your... Wake up.

1064
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,193
- Come on. Wake up.
- Wake up, come on.

1065
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,164
Whoever is pissing on me is a dead man.

1066
01:03:58,868 --> 01:03:59,994
Get up.

1067
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,929
- Where'd you get a mop?
- I found a bucket outside.

1068
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,440
- Outside?
- Ash, wake up.

1069
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:10,070
- Ash, wake up.
- I'm up.

1070
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:12,714
Look, I found a back door.
Let's get the hell out of here.

1071
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:15,216
Hey, Eli. I found a way out.

1072
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:17,244
You're clean.

1073
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:20,053
Yeah, there's a mop and bucket out back.

1074
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,319
Oh, God.

1075
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,230
Hey, what the...

1076
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:40,075
- There we go.
- Get me off. Get it off.

1077
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,610
- Oh, yeah.
- Harder.

1078
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,776
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, it's a mop, dude. It's a mop.

1079
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:49,642
All right.

1080
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,916
Jesus. For a second, man, I thought...

1081
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:54,717
I thought for a second...

1082
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:55,813
- Right here.
- Yeah, here we go, dude.

1083
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,182
There we go.

1084
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,352
Oh, yeah.

1085
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:00,656
Relax, E, there's no dog.

1086
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,253
There we go.

1087
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:09,230
So, Eli, you figured out
how we're gonna get out of here?

1088
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:13,273
We're completely fenced in,
and we're surrounded by razor wire.

1089
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:17,067
You're not thinking we're actually
gonna climb that fence, do you?

1090
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:18,168
No.

1091
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:26,682
Johnny?

1092
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,387
Hey, Johnny C, you all right, man?

1093
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:32,086
- Johnny, can you hear me?
- Dude, are you okay?

1094
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,630
- You guys are pathetic.
- That's not funny!

1095
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:43,797
Come on.

1096
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:52,011
Hey, you guys, you don't think
there's any rats down here, do you?

1097
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:55,244
Eli, for once in your life,
could you just not be a girl?

1098
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,678
What the fuck is...

1099
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:11,390
Please, don't tell me
there's any heads in there, okay?

1100
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,227
Well?

1101
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,465
You can relax, Eli. It's not severed heads.

1102
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,869
- Holy...
- Shit!

1103
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,241
Oh, my God!

1104
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,575
You guys know what this is, right?

1105
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,980
That's the money that was stolen
from the casino last night.

1106
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,574
That's $5 million.

1107
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,787
- The people that stole this...
- They're all dead!

1108
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:35,153
Which means we're the only ones
who know where this is.

1109
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,885
- Yes!
- Holy shit!

1110
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,319
Oh, my God!

1111
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,418
Do you understand what this means?

1112
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,621
We're rich!

1113
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:41,958
- Calm down.
- We're rich!

1114
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:44,898
- Whoa!
- Whoa, what?

1115
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,868
Hold up.
Just, let's think about this for a second.

1116
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,401
Just calm down
and just try to think about it.

1117
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:51,973
- Okay?
- Okay. You're right.

1118
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,302
There are a lot of people out there
that would kill for this much money.

1119
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,074
- Am I right?
- I think he's right.

1120
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:00,137
What the...

1121
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:03,013
Whoever's not comfortable taking the money
shouldn't be forced into taking it.

1122
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:05,612
I'm sure the rest of us would be
more than happy to split up your share...

1123
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,179
of $5 million!

1124
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:10,350
- $5 million!
- Holy shit!

1125
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:16,625
There is $1 million here for each of us.

1126
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,799
Let's keep moving.

1127
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:21,893
One, two, three.

1128
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:25,432
- Coming up.
- Coming up.

1129
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:29,745
- Man.
- Got him.

1130
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,310
You know, if somebody had asked me
yesterday if I'd go through everything...

1131
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:40,253
that we went through for $1 million,
I'd say, hell, yes.

1132
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:45,157
And the things that I'm gonna do
with this money. Two words for you fellas...

1133
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,562
mutual funds.

1134
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:49,654
You know what I'm gonna do
with my share of the money?

1135
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:54,692
On Rush Street I'm gonna open up
the Johnny C's Bra Shop.

1136
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:57,404
But in the back, it'll be like a strip club.

1137
01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:00,805
With this money I'm moving to Jamaica
and buy a big-ass field.

1138
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,840
I ain't gonna waste my plants.

1139
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,880
Fuck it, the male plants get smoked, too.

1140
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,539
I'm gonna give Lisa the best wedding ever.

1141
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:09,106
And screw our honeymoon. I mean, Hawaii?
Screw that.

1142
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:12,120
I'm gonna take a week off work,
and we'll go to... No, I'll take a year off.

1143
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:13,177
Oh, shit.

1144
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,986
Yeah, it's official. I'm not getting married.

1145
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,526
- Of course you are.
- Not if I'm in prison.

1146
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,687
Hey, for the record,
men in prison get married every day.

1147
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:25,029
- Is that supposed to be comforting?
- Relax. Relax guys. Nobody's going to jail.

1148
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,171
Well, that's all I'm doing is walking.

1149
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,035
You know what I'm saying?
All I'm doing is walking right now.

1150
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:33,631
You know what I mean? I'm just walking.

1151
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:35,471
- Just walking.
- Walking.

1152
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:40,709
- We're running.
- All right, run! I lied, run!

1153
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:43,114
Guys!

1154
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:45,286
You can't run from the police!

1155
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:48,278
Oh, my God!

1156
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,451
Okay, get down.

1157
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:55,689
Don't move!

1158
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,857
- Stay right there.
- Okay. Okay. Don't move.

1159
01:08:57,933 --> 01:08:59,560
- Face-down.
- Stay right there.

1160
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:04,228
- Man...
- We know. Fuck Osama bin Laden.

1161
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,957
You said your identification is where again?

1162
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:29,063
Like I told you, my wallet was stolen.

1163
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:31,927
- By a female Elvis impersonator?
- Yes.

1164
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,767
- She's also a spaghetti wrestler.
- That's what she said, a very famous one.

1165
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,532
She's so famous,
how come I haven't heard of her?

1166
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:44,376
- What were you doing in that part of town?
- We got lost.

1167
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:47,345
You didn't stop by the set of a porno movie,
did you?

1168
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:51,580
Us? No. Jeez, I mean, I wish.

1169
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:57,889
- Why do you ask?
- Because the producer, named Harry Hard...

1170
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:01,995
and his security guard,
were beaten to death by a maniac.

1171
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,595
Are you honestly gonna try to tell me
that you guys are in town...

1172
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,533
for a bachelor party weekend?

1173
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,704
Which one of you
was supposed to be getting married?

1174
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:14,969
I am. At least, I was.

1175
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,043
Well, tell me about her, your fiancée.

1176
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:23,015
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny.

1177
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:27,312
I fell in love with her the first time I met her.

1178
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:31,722
Sounds like a great girl.

1179
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,795
She is.

1180
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,792
Truth is, Lisa deserves better than me.

1181
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:43,029
Well, I've never met her,
but I gotta say, I agree with you.

1182
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:47,673
Do you mind explaining to me
how a supposed bachelor party...

1183
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,712
turned into one of the biggest robberies
in the history of Las Vegas?

1184
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:54,038
We found the money.
We had nothing to do with the robbery.

1185
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:56,141
That's not what the owners
of the Golden Nugget say.

1186
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:57,207
What?

1187
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:01,278
He said the five of you intentionally
tried to distract him and his security staff.

1188
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:04,085
That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous.

1189
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:07,219
Is it? Twelve people ID'd you at the scene.

1190
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:11,188
Twelve people make a jury.
You better think about that.

1191
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,392
He said his name was Carmine T. Angelo.

1192
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:16,495
And you had no idea
that it was Dominic Calcutta?

1193
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,073
He said he was an associate of Mr. Kidd.

1194
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,439
May he rest in peace.

1195
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:23,010
You knew him?

1196
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:26,439
Mr. Kidd threw my bachelor party weekend.

1197
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:28,005
That's great.

1198
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,517
It was one hell of a great time.

1199
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:31,780
I'm sure it was.

1200
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:36,018
I gotta say that it was
probably the greatest weekend of my life.

1201
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:39,060
He made all the arrangements
and everything.

1202
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:43,661
We were supposed to have
backstage passes to see Wayne Newton.

1203
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:46,064
Did you get to see Wayne's show?

1204
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:49,060
- No.
- That's too bad.

1205
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:53,536
For my money,
Wayne puts on the best show in town.

1206
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:58,039
All right, let's just say
that I believe you for a second.

1207
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:02,512
Now you tell me, why would someone
planning to rob a casino...

1208
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:05,414
pretend to be a bachelor party planner?

1209
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:08,387
To set us up, I guess.

1210
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:11,849
Well, I guess it worked, didn't it?

1211
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,627
That's it, man. I'm done talking.

1212
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:18,166
I'm not saying another thing
without my lawyer.

1213
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,326
All right, have it your way.

1214
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:23,164
But I'm sure you'll talk to the Feds.

1215
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:26,203
Look, I said... Wait.

1216
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,311
- Why would I be talking to the Feds?
- I guess you didn't hear.

1217
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:32,575
FBI agent working undercover
inside the Golden Nugget...

1218
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:35,242
was killed last night in the robbery.

1219
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,712
You fellas are looking at a minimum...

1220
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:44,088
of conspiracy to commit murder
of a federal officer.

1221
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:47,720
That's mandatory time
in a federal penitentiary.

1222
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,892
This just can't get any worse.

1223
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,261
Oh, yeah?

1224
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,666
You ever done any time?

1225
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:57,035
Can't say that I have, no.

1226
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,944
- You ever been fucked in the ass?
- Excuse me?

1227
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,208
I have.

1228
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,444
Oh, you bleed like shit the first time.

1229
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:12,419
But you get used to it.

1230
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:15,355
You get used to a lot of things in prison.

1231
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,921
Like hearing the screams of death
of some poor fool...

1232
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:21,485
echoing through the cold night air.

1233
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:25,023
While you trying to jerk off...

1234
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,967
for the third time that day.

1235
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:30,832
Wonder why every now and then...

1236
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:34,375
you find yourself thinking about your sister.

1237
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,413
You boys ever done any time?

1238
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:48,081
Just say yes.

1239
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:52,893
Stone. Chuck Liddell, how are you?

1240
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:55,228
Listen, thanks for those seats
the other night at the fight.

1241
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:57,356
Lois and I had a great time.

1242
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,025
You smell good.

1243
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,102
You so pretty.

1244
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,399
Bachelor party T-shirts, huh?

1245
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:10,042
Okay. Thanks for the information, Chuck.

1246
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:13,007
We're just one happy family.

1247
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:18,777
Okay, boys, it's time to go.

1248
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:21,914
- Time to go.
- No.

1249
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:24,753
See you.

1250
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,489
- Let him go!
- No!

1251
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,963
You can run, but you can't hide.

1252
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,592
You come on back
and see Gold Tooth real soon!

1253
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:38,262
Gold Tooth gonna find you!

1254
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,278
No, Officer Stone, I don't wanna talk to you.
Why would I wanna talk to you?

1255
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:45,540
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

1256
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:48,082
What you mean to say
is you're gonna talk to your daddy's lawyer.

1257
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:50,549
Well, here's the news
for your daddy's lawyer.

1258
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:53,588
He's gonna be very expensive
when he has to talk to the FBI.

1259
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:56,215
Daddy's not gonna like that. So good luck.

1260
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:57,781
Next customer.

1261
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:10,027
How the hell did things get this bad?

1262
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:13,665
I'll tell you how. If I'd have let Nathan
go to the airport when he wanted to...

1263
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:14,901
we wouldn't be here.

1264
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:18,468
- Don't even go there.
- I guilted you into staying. You know that.

1265
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:21,981
- We all did.
- Hey, if this is anybody's fault, it's mine.

1266
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:26,384
- How exactly is this your fault?
- Because, if you wanna know the truth...

1267
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:28,954
I didn't want
a wild and crazy bachelor party weekend.

1268
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,924
Why didn't you say something?

1269
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:34,190
Same reason you lied
about cheating on your SATs.

1270
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:37,090
I was trying to be something I'm not.

1271
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:39,460
Well, that's true.

1272
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,535
Oh, my God.

1273
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:50,669
Please, don't tell me that's who I think it is.

1274
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:55,883
Okay, I need weed, now!

1275
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:01,684
Transport 1-9,
we have an emergency situation.

1276
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,189
Repeat, emergency.

1277
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:07,719
Traveling with five suspects
in a casino robbery east on Highway...

1278
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,400
It's a fucking shotgun!

1279
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,869
We're gonna die. We're gonna die, guys.

1280
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:22,569
We're not gonna die. Shut the fuck up.

1281
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,984
How's it going back there, fellas?

1282
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:34,188
Guess you figured out
who really killed Harry. Haven't you?

1283
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:37,053
- What do you want with us?
- I gotta frame somebody.

1284
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,285
Relax.

1285
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:40,862
The only thing each of you has to decide...

1286
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,487
is how you wanna die.

1287
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:44,458
What?

1288
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:47,969
I'll take overdosing on Viagra
with teenage nymphos when I'm 90, please.

1289
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:50,300
- Not one of your options.
- Okay, how about this?

1290
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,600
- How about just a straight-up overdose?
- No.

1291
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:55,802
Okay, fine. What the hell are our choices?

1292
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:58,277
Getting chopped up into bitty pieces...

1293
01:16:58,347 --> 01:16:59,814
being burned alive...

1294
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:02,611
being buried alive, getting eaten alive...

1295
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:05,119
and drowning.

1296
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:09,718
- You're gonna eat us?
- Not me, you sicko. My dogs are.

1297
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:11,389
And only one of you.

1298
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:16,056
Each of you gets to die a different way.
You choose. Or I'll do it for you.

1299
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:17,563
Oh, God.

1300
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:24,569
Wonder what kind of dogs he has.

1301
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:11,315
- Jesus.
- It's about time.

1302
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:17,121
- I guess this is it.
- Where do you think we are?

1303
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,654
Hell would be a fair guess.

1304
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:25,258
- When I open this door, come outside.
- Get out of there.

1305
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:27,699
Take it easy, man.

1306
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,596
- Okay, I'm getting out.
- Take this off.

1307
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:33,266
- Where are you taking us?
- Shut your hole.

1308
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,172
For the record,
we've already seen your faces...

1309
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,040
so the hoods are kind of pointless, right?

1310
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:39,603
We're not gonna kill you.
We're just gonna watch.

1311
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,342
Dude, you like to watch? I love to watch.

1312
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,281
That means we totally have
so much in common.

1313
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:46,411
The more you open your mouth,
the longer I'll make you suffer.

1314
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:49,613
- Are we in an elevator?
- We're going up.

1315
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:53,491
- I decided to see if one of you could fly.
- That wasn't one of the choices.

1316
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:56,087
Changed my mind.
What are you gonna do about it?

1317
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:59,667
- Uncuff me and find out.
- Is that so, bachelor boy?

1318
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,498
You're goddamn right.

1319
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,327
Let's find out.

1320
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:06,070
Oh, shit.

1321
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:11,612
Come on, take this fucking hood off.

1322
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,072
It doesn't matter anymore.
Come on, assholes!

1323
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:59,157
Absolute fucking genius!

1324
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:22,746
I knew it. I did. No, this is awesome.

1325
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:39,097
- That's insane.
- Jaime Pressly's here.

1326
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:49,941
Gentlemen.

1327
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:52,380
My real name is Mr. Kidd.

1328
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:56,613
Welcome to
Nathan's Bachelor Party Weekend.

1329
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,175
You are now part...

1330
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:02,019
of one of the longest-running secrets
in the history of Las Vegas.

1331
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:07,760
The first thing you should know is that
none of you were ever in any real danger.

1332
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:11,457
No one actually died.
No one was ever even hurt.

1333
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:16,636
Me or someone from our staff was
in constant communication with everyone...

1334
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:19,068
you encountered along the way.

1335
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:22,569
The second is a message
from Z Bob's brother.

1336
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,345
And it reads...

1337
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:30,249
How was Wayne Newton, by the way?

1338
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:33,082
"We can only hope you enjoyed yourselves
as much as we did...

1339
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:35,145
"when we were in your shoes.

1340
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,350
"Each of you is now one of us.

1341
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:41,657
"For the sake of those who will follow,
please never forget...

1342
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,522
"Commandment Number One."

1343
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:44,929
Thank you.

1344
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,463
- I know.
- Z?

1345
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:47,865
- Yeah?
- Yo.

1346
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:51,038
Your brothers are cool. I take it back.
They're cool.

1347
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:53,937
Every bachelor party that I orchestrate
is different.

1348
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:57,273
But we could not do it
without the full cooperation...

1349
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:59,245
of the good people of Las Vegas...

1350
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:01,976
and my very dear friend, the Mayor.

1351
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:08,985
While every adventure is unlike any other,
the point is always the same.

1352
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:12,151
Young men come here,
thinking that a bachelor party weekend...

1353
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:16,789
is all about pushing the bounds of decency
and stretching their moral codes.

1354
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:18,298
And while it is...

1355
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:21,062
what it really is about, is friendship.

1356
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:23,769
The friendship among the five of you...

1357
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:27,604
the bonds that you have forged,
that you are so worried that will change...

1358
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:29,540
now that one of you is getting married.

1359
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:33,147
And the reality is, the bonds will change.
That's life.

1360
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:36,345
A wedding is
when a father gives away his daughter.

1361
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:38,045
But a bachelor party...

1362
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:41,486
is when a group of guys
give away their best friend.

1363
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:45,886
Well, now you can, because
you have shared one final adventure.

1364
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,088
You will never have to worry
what might have been...

1365
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:51,894
because you have already shared
the greatest thing there is.

1366
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,665
Friendship.

1367
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:03,639
Let me remind you that, officially,
the main event has not even started yet.

1368
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:06,942
You still have a party to attend,
which will begin shortly...

1369
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,973
- as soon as your friends arrive.
- All right.

1370
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:11,814
For now,
I suggest you guys go take a shower.

1371
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:13,581
Trust me, you need it.

1372
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,885
- When you return, Johnny C...
- Huh?

1373
01:23:15,957 --> 01:23:19,415
...prime rib, mashed potatoes, gravy.
Everything you want.

1374
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:22,663
Ash, a gallon of cookie-dough ice cream.

1375
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:25,959
Eli, shrimp cocktail. All you desire.

1376
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:29,001
- And Z Bob, guess what I got for you.
- What?

1377
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,681
- Has this been here the whole time?
- What?

1378
01:24:53,054 --> 01:24:56,023
- This camera.
- What camera?

1379
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:10,166
- I'm gonna pass out.
- All right.

1380
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:46,831
What would you like...

1381
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:50,172
to watch me do to her first?

1382
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:52,907
Very graceful.
Those dance lessons are really paying off.

1383
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,846
I just...

1384
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:37,619
Asshole!

1385
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:55,742
We could offer a highlighter
instead of the dildo. Same function.

1386
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:57,270
Too small?

1387
01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:00,438
You sure haven't seen these highlighters,
my lady.

1388
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:04,679
- Do you still have that pickle?
- I ate it this morning.

1389
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:24,399
I said my last line, you can go now!

1390
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,648
Hey!

1391
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:46,251
Hey!

1392
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:49,192
Keep the shit coming!

1393
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:26,458
- Never.
- None of us are gonna forgive you for this.

1394
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:29,162
Never. Never again. Never.

1395
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:32,400
Stop. Why are you doing that?

1396
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:48,620
I'm starving. Sorry.

1397
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:50,153
Prime...

1398
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:55,622
Stop it. "Goosefaba."

1399
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:00,628
Ready and action.

1400
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,403
I tried. I really tried.

1401
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:07,759
- Can I ask you boys something?
- Anything.

1402
01:30:09,303 --> 01:30:11,828
Did any of you happen to bring a dildo
with you?

1403
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:13,897
Wait? What did you just say?
What did you say?

1404
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:15,169
Yes.

1405
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,610
'Cause I'm gonna do a dildo show for you.

1406
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:20,909
Bring in the dildo.
