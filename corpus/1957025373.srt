1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,916
[chuckles softly]

2
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,291
Ooh, give me.

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,125
Whatever!
You know, you better be careful

4
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,833
I might just leave you
for your buddy Jughead.

5
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,291
- Original.
- [laughs]

6
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,166
Does that mean you're Betty?

7
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,416
You know, I'm Veronica.

8
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, you see Jughead,
tell him I stole his cigarette.

9
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,125
[gasps]

10
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,958
You better be careful Archie.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,208
I heard Jughead
doesn't like thieves.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,625
[chuckles]

13
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,666
[fly buzzes]

14
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,875
Seriously,
you're not going to give me one?

15
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,416
Come on.

16
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:20,625
[man 1] Psychopomps are entities
whose role is not to charge the deceased,

17
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:25,541
but to guide them to their
final destination in the afterlife.

18
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:30,916
[suspenseful music playing]

19
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,750
[man 2] You know, Archie,
your grandma gave me these binoculars

20
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,291
- and she said they were magical.
- [Archie] Really?

21
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:44,125
Yep, she said that sometimes if
you are you looking through them

22
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,625
that you can see the
spirits of your loved ones.

23
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,833
- [Archie] Do you see grandma?
- [man 2] Nope, all I can see is birds.

24
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,708
[tranquil music playing]

25
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,208
[distorted voice] Who are you?

26
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,208
Where are we?

27
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,083
Very nice.

28
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,708
- Where are we?
- [clears throat]

29
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,833
[laughs]

30
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,666
[calm music playing]

31
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,458
[laughs]

32
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:12,125
[suspenseful music playing]

33
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,333
[man 3] Archie,
I need you to close your eyes for me.

34
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:52,791
We're going to do an exercise to put you
back into those dreams you've been having.

35
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,458
Take a deep breath.

36
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,750
Relax your mind.

37
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,666
What do you see?

38
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,541
Tell me what you dreamed.

39
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:12,750
I'm standing in a
sketchy restroom.

40
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,166
I walk into the room.

41
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:28,458
I hear a electric buzzing
sound behind me.

42
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,750
[electricity buzzing]

43
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,333
I turn around.

44
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,541
- [sighs] - Keep going.

45
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,291
I hear a woman scream.

46
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,875
[screams]

47
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,750
I want to help her...

48
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,750
but it's blocking the doorway.

49
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,000
It's blocking the doorway.

50
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,750
[shivers]

51
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:03,000
I see bugs coming
out of a TV screen.

52
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,208
[sobs] They're coming for me.

53
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,791
- They're coming for me!
- [man 3] Archie.

54
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,666
Open your eyes.

55
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,166
Birdie.

56
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,791
[man 3] Who's Birdie?

57
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,291
You have amnesia,

58
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,208
but your subconscious is
trying to help you remember.

59
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,916
You should go back to these
places you're seeing in your mind

60
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:36,750
and maybe they'll
trigger your memory.

61
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:47,541
[suspenseful music playing]

62
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,500
[trolley clattering]

63
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:01,666
I got a special
ticket just for you.

64
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,125
[laughs]

65
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,916
Hi, Archie. I'm Dr. Dunn.

66
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,916
We have to talk.

67
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,333
That ticket you got there that's
for a free meal and for a free trip.

68
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,791
[car engine revs]

69
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,791
Time to eat, Archie.

70
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,916
We made some food for you.

71
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,583
[clock ticking]

72
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,458
Archie, the reason I brought
you here is to enlighten you.

73
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,291
This meal is specially
formulated for you.

74
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:04,250
You've been walking around like a
zombie since your unfortunate event.

75
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,916
I can help you.

76
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,083
We can help you.

77
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,250
All you have to
do is eat your food.

78
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,333
Then you'll know what's what.

79
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,291
Isn't that what we
all want to know?

80
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,958
Where we come from? Where
we go when the curtains go down?

81
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:40,416
We're born into a question mark and then we're
just left here with no answers to anything.

82
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,125
We flood our youth with vanity

83
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:47,500
and our old age is filled
with fear of the unknown.

84
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,833
That's how you feel, right?

85
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,958
You want to know what happened.

86
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,291
Well, now you can.

87
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,458
It's time to eat.

88
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,750
It's time to take
that final ride.

89
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,708
Eat your food, Archie Finch.

90
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,333
[Archie] I can't.

91
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,083
I'm sure I'll be hungry soon.

92
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,541
[clock continues ticking]

93
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,791
Okay...

94
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,708
another meal's always
around the corner.

95
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,625
Into the kitchen we go,
where we end up nobody knows.

96
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,625
[Archie groaning]

97
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,458
Do you know the
muffin-man The muffin-man?

98
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Do you know the muffin-man
Who lives on Drury Lane?

99
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:53,125
[screams]

100
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:01,500
- [alarm beeping] - [gasps]]

101
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,000
[knocking]

102
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,541
[Mary] Be right there.

103
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,083
Archie!

104
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,625
Come on in.

105
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,375
Come on in,
Archie. I'll be right there.

106
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:38,166
[suspenseful music playing]

107
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:16,125
[electricity buzzing]

108
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,666
[groaning]

109
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:30,041
[distorted voices]

110
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,750
[Mary] Archie,
you don't look so good.

111
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,000
So how's your memory?

112
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,500
Do you remember anything new?

113
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:57,125
It's like all the puzzle
pieces are out there...

114
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,458
but I... just can't find it.

115
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,583
It's like I'm blind...

116
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,833
and I just can't see them.

117
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:16,208
I'm here for you not just as
your assistant, but as your friend.

118
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,791
You were once there for me during a hard
time and I want to be there for you also.

119
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,333
Hey,
it'll... it'll come back to you.

120
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,041
Here they are.

121
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,375
All your contacts.

122
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,083
Now I can find Ed.

123
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,166
[sighs]

124
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,083
Got to say...

125
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,750
you're not the Archie
I remember very well.

126
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,916
I don't remember you at all

127
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,458
but I'm told that you're
key to my success.

128
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,708
One of the keys,
definitely the skeleton key.

129
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,875
[Kim laughs] You got that right,
Ed. You're definitely a skeleton.

130
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,833
I keep telling him to eat some steak and
egg, all he wants is coffee, coffee, coffee.

131
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:31,142
[Ed] If I don't have coffee and chokes, I'm
living in the land of the dead here, Kim.

132
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,875
[chuckles] Ain't we all?

133
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,083
[sighs]

134
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,083
This is the guy that's
going to find your film.

135
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,083
[chuckles softly]

136
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,708
It's just a stand-in.

137
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,375
And this is his girlfriend.

138
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,291
She wants to be the
lead actress in your film

139
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:07,625
and if you let her her boyfriend
will fund the whole movie.

140
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,375
[Archie] He'll fund
the whole film?

141
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:17,250
Yes, and I bet he'd throw a really good
wrap party like a cowboy on his own dime.

142
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,333
Hmm.

143
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:28,833
Oh, my doctor says that
if I get back to doing things

144
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:33,250
that I have been doing before,

145
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,833
maybe I'll start to remember
something in my past.

146
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,083
Sounds like a yes to me.

147
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,125
Oh, yeah.

148
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,791
Hmm, attaboy, Arch.

149
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:56,083
Oh,
one more thing I forgot to mention.

150
00:15:56,125 --> 00:16:00,333
His girlfriend is, um...

151
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,875
a little like out there.

152
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,375
- How so? - She sees things.

153
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,041
Things?

154
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:19,041
Yeah, but she's on some crazy
shit that makes you go bye-bye.

155
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:22,916
[scoffs] I could use
some crazy shit.

156
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,041
I've been experiencing some
weird things lately myself.

157
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,666
Really? Like what?

158
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,958
I don't know. Maybe
this amnesia thing...

159
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,708
but... [sighs]

160
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,083
anyway.

161
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,958
- Let's make a movie.
- Attaboy, Arch.

162
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,291
To our lead actress.

163
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,500
A star is born.

164
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,958
- [woman 1] You thirsty?
- Not today.

165
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,708
And what have you been
busying yourself with?

166
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,083
Well, to be completely honest...

167
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,791
I've been losing chunks of time.

168
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:30,041
You can't expect for your brain to be in tip-top
shape after what happened to you, Archie.

169
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,750
Yeah, I know.

170
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,791
I don't even remember
how I got here.

171
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:41,625
Maybe seeing some things from
your past will jog your memory.

172
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:50,500
Actually, there was one thing
I was hoping to take a look at.

173
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,708
Do you still have that
belt buckle dad left me?

174
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,458
Ah,
so you do remember something.

175
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:03,375
[suspenseful music playing]

176
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,250
[man 4] Look! Look deep.

177
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,208
Deeper.

178
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:18,000
Think about what's down there.

179
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,916
What's been there for ages.

180
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,416
No one knows.

181
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,791
Before the dinosaurs,
this was here.

182
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:33,833
So dark, so deep,
so many things hidden,

183
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:40,000
we'll never know,
we'll never ever know.

184
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,416
Just think about it.

185
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:49,041
Imagine what could be there.

186
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:53,291
Search your mind.
Every little crevice.

187
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,541
Search. Deeper.

188
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,000
Deeper.

189
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,333
Yes, you see it.

190
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,166
You begin to see. Yes, yes.

191
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:11,291
I can tell. [laughs] Yes,
you found it.

192
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,541
Ah,
I can tell. I can feel it myself.

193
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,083
Oh! Oh, yes.

194
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:21,291
Wonder of wonders,
it's there. It's there.

195
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:25,333
I see it in your eye,
windows to the soul.

196
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,291
You can't hide a thing.

197
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,541
[phone ringing]

198
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,125
[gasps]

199
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,625
[breathing heavily]

200
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,375
[dance music playing]

201
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,791
[man 5] I think I can get
behind that. I'll see you there.

202
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,625
Like clockwork, you always seem
to bring my drink right when I need it,

203
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,875
fulfilling a woman's
duty to servitude.

204
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,750
That's not very nice.

205
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,333
[choking]

206
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,416
[thuds]

207
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,958
How can I help you?

208
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,041
[Archie] What just happened?

209
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,833
Call it performance art.

210
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:49,333
I see you don't have
any clocks in this place.

211
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,666
Do you happen to have the time?

212
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,583
[scoffs]

213
00:20:56,625 --> 00:21:02,541
We don't have the time,
but we do have a phone.

214
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,333
Use that card.

215
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,666
Can I get you a drink,
young man?

216
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,458
[Archie] I'll take a martini.

217
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,416
Coming right up.

218
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:29,250
[tranquil music playing]

219
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:54,666
There we go. A warm belly is nice, like a
warm bed or a warm lady for that matter.

220
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,666
How you doing, Son?

221
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,000
[Archie] Do you
happen to have the time?

222
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,208
[man 6] This man wants
to know if I have the time.

223
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,500
[laughing]

224
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,875
Piss on time.

225
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,166
Here at the Evil Olive...

226
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,958
we leave time at the door.

227
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,916
Look,
I didn't mean any disrespect.

228
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:37,583
It's just I've been waiting
here for someone over an hour.

229
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:44,333
I just feel like I've
been here much longer.

230
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,166
[telephone rings]

231
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,708
Yeah, she's here.

232
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,583
She stopped that.

233
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:04,250
Now let's see if I can get this
rogue soul to realize his destiny.

234
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,666
[chuckles softly]

235
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:17,333
Why don't you spend your time downstairs in
our VIP room, wait for your friend Ed there.

236
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:21,166
[tense music playing]

237
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:30,958
[distorted voice]

238
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:39,916
[suspenseful music playing]

239
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,500
- Archie. - Yeah.

240
00:23:54,541 --> 00:24:00,250
I'm Thana. Ed sent
me. He couldn't make it.

241
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,333
Thought you might
need the company.

242
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,125
Oh.

243
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,791
He insisted.

244
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,000
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, uh, he's fine.

245
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,083
- I'll get us some drinks.
- No need.

246
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,958
I ordered us a few drinks.

247
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,375
You get the next round.

248
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:28,333
[low beat music playing]

249
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:58,375
What's this drink called?

250
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:01,333
"A Short Trip to Hell."

251
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,458
[suspenseful music playing]

252
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:11,250
Someone is as serious
as the plague up in here.

253
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,833
It's just a rum and Coke.

254
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:23,000
I take it you're the type of guy that
fancies a simple drink, like a rum and Coke.

255
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,958
I guess you'd be right.

256
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,666
What's your favorite
drink of choice?

257
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:41,250
Dirty whore's bath
water. Classic drink.

258
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,916
[laughs]

259
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:52,916
You want to see my head spin around,
order me that second drink.

260
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:55,250
Yes, Ma'am.

261
00:25:55,291 --> 00:26:00,000
[low beat music playing]

262
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,125
Get the lady an exorcist.

263
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,583
[groans]

264
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,000
[coughs]

265
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,125
[groans]

266
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:33,250
Oh, I felt that one.

267
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:38,833
One of my favorites.

268
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,166
[groaning]

269
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,333
You poisoned me.

270
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,958
[suspenseful music playing]

271
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:11,541
[laughter echoing]

272
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:57,166
[car rumbling]

273
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:01,916
I know. I know. You'll be fine.

274
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:04,250
We just have to get you home.

275
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:07,666
I'm flying like a thousand bats here,
babe.

276
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:09,500
Don't get your
panties in a bunch.

277
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,791
[Archie] I feel sick.

278
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,500
[Thana] I know it
was a long night.

279
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:20,166
I have heard that morning
sickness is never fun.

280
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:32,833
Now let's get you to bed.

281
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:39,833
Please,
I need some stomach medicine.

282
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:44,166
Anything. Give me something.

283
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:50,916
I've got something,
but it will take you out of this world.

284
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,833
Do you accept that?

285
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:56,083
It'll take away all the pain.

286
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:59,250
Yes, the pain is killing me.

287
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:02,958
[low beat music playing]

288
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,208
Eat up.

289
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:35,250
It's the only way
to cure your agony.

290
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,750
[breathing heavily]

291
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:13,958
Thank you. Thank you.

292
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,208
Thank you.

293
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:30,666
I need you to finish your food,
Archie.

294
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:42,083
Don't be ungrateful.
Finish your food.

295
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,416
It's for your health.

296
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,458
[Archie] Is that human blood?

297
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:04,541
Eat your fucking food.

298
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,791
[Archie] Ah!

299
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:20,750
[Archie groaning and coughing]

300
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:40,625
[retching]

301
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:06,166
[panting]

302
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,125
[tense music playing]

303
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:22,916
Oh, so you're the camera.
Let me take a look in there.

304
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:25,833
[electronic buzzing]

305
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:20,083
[woman 2] Archie!

306
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:33,250
[distorted voice]
You're coming with us.

307
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:44,291
- [Ed] Look, Arch, we need to talk.
- Where have you been?

308
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,166
No, no, no, man.

309
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:50,208
Who's that psycho bitch, Thana?

310
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:57,333
Look, man, you know this industry,
they're off their rockers.

311
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:01,541
I got caught up that night.
I got a little drunk, sorry.

312
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,708
[Archie] She started
poisoning me.

313
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:08,000
Started feeding me blood.

314
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:13,125
That's ten miles from the rocker,
Ed.

315
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,625
What the fuck!

316
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,875
Look, I don't know these people.

317
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:19,583
We don't know these people.

318
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:22,208
That's just how things are, man.

319
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,166
What you need to worry about,
Archie Finch,

320
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:29,625
is getting back into the director's chair,
back in the zone.

321
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:32,750
Everything else, man,
will take care of itself.

322
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:35,458
Yeah.

323
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,208
I guess.

324
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,916
It all remains to be seen.

325
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:01,125
[door opens then closes]

326
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:11,583
[Archie] Hey! Any of
you know where to get a...

327
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,125
[Retrovision] There's
a lighter in your pocket.

328
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:48,333
Burn the airplane. Hurry up.

329
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:50,916
You're being watched.

330
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,916
Once inside Hardy's house,

331
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:59,458
go up the first set of stairs,
knock on the door at the top.

332
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,708
[crows cawing]

333
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:16,208
[knocks]

334
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:22,916
[suspenseful music playing]

335
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:29,166
Hardy walks, you follow.

336
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:48,666
[somber music playing]

337
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:08,833
[cackling]

338
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,041
[ringing]

339
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,375
[Rita] Hello.

340
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:26,666
Hi.

341
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,625
Come look at my dollhouse.

342
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:38,000
He's been stuck on the
second floor for quite some time.

343
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:42,333
It's been a thousand years,
if you measure it in human years.

344
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:44,625
That's a bit.

345
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:49,916
Upstairs or downstairs,
he can't seem to make up his mind.

346
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,375
Careful, you might fall in.

347
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,083
[snickers]

348
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:01,666
Right, I wouldn't want that.

349
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:05,958
Why can't he go
up to the third floor?

350
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,875
Well,
you can't make anyone do anything.

351
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,833
Archie.

352
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,750
How'd you know my name?

353
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,250
[giggles]

354
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:25,583
There's this thing that he
does that I can't quite figure out,

355
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:29,958
but... but maybe you
can help me figure it out.

356
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,875
- What does he do? - Come, come.

357
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:39,125
[knocking on door]

358
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:40,166
[laughs]

359
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:42,583
I got to go.

360
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:46,666
Yes, you do.

361
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:49,250
But, hmm...

362
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:56,125
is it upstairs or down?

363
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,416
[giggles]

364
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,333
What is he doing here?

365
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:10,166
- Done. Done, look, I'm done.
- [woman 3] You lost. You lost.

366
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:11,500
Come sit.

367
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,833
Sit with Hardy.

368
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:28,375
So, why does a man feel the need to carry
a little killing machine on his person?

369
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:32,125
Oh! Well, yeah,
that's right, protection.

370
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:37,125
Well, allow me to provide
you with your new best friend.

371
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,750
Open the box.

372
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,125
[box creaks open.]

373
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:06,208
Ah, I think I see what ails you.

374
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,291
A woman can get a fella
into all sorts of trouble.

375
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:15,958
For instance,
a woman scorned or a damsel in distress.

376
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:21,083
You ever rescued a
damsel in distress?

377
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:24,541
Anyways,
I thought I should tell you,

378
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:27,291
some guy used his
gun to kill his own self.

379
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:32,208
He killed himself good,
real good, over a dame.

380
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:36,625
Even worse it was a gift
given to him by a dear friend,

381
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:40,208
but I got it now,
it works and it's for sale.

382
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,791
Consider that your
new King Kong,

383
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:46,250
just in case you're the,
uh, damsel in distress.

384
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:49,208
Now, let's get you out of here.

385
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,750
[dramatic music playing]

386
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:08,166
[man 7] Pull over.

387
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:21,500
You guys have been
following me since 1983.

388
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:23,208
It seems.

389
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,083
Oh, like a couple of time cops,
huh?

390
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,333
[laughs] I like that.

391
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:30,083
You're Archibald Finch?

392
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,583
Yup.

393
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:39,458
The director of low-budget trash,
Archibald Finch.

394
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,458
What can I help you guys with?

395
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:50,541
Ah,
just some normal stuff. Murder.

396
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:55,083
Got enemies, Archie?

397
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,166
I don't know.

398
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:58,958
I have amnesia.

399
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:04,541
Oh, so he might have enemies

400
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:09,833
but he just don't remember, huh.

401
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:15,750
This is so weird. I
mean brain injuries.

402
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,833
Just all mysterious, you know...

403
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:24,250
makes us think how much like
them goddamn bots we really are.

404
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,184
You know I'm starting to think we're
actually in a simulation, Detective James.

405
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:30,375
Oh, oh, Pete. Look,
oh, oh, I'm glitching.

406
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:34,416
Oh, oh. I'm all Android, baby.

407
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:35,875
[laughs]

408
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:39,708
- Mm. Mm. Mm.
- I'm more of an Apple guy.

409
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:44,291
You've bitten into any,
uh, rotten apples, Archie?

410
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:48,166
Women can be rotten apples,
too, right?

411
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:52,583
Both sour and sweet.

412
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:58,416
Some are even occupied
by that little worm.

413
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:01,833
But that's never stopped you,
has it, Archie?

414
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:05,583
You know, sometimes we even
bite into that nasty little seed.

415
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,750
And what is that
seed filled with?

416
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:09,958
Cyanide.

417
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,416
[both laugh]

418
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,083
Man.

419
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,625
We're just messing with you,
man.

420
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:25,208
It will take a whole lot of, uh, apple worms
and cyanide seeds to kill a human, right?

421
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,791
But only one woman.

422
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:29,125
[snickers]

423
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:32,458
Here's the business, Archie.

424
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:36,833
Someone tried to do a hit on you,
but...

425
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:41,041
only he survived.

426
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,708
Why would someone
want to do that to you?

427
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,916
[Pete] Yeah.

428
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,500
I honestly don't know.

429
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:51,208
[Pete] We think you do know.

430
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:56,208
We think you're using this amnesia as an
excuse to forget something you regret doing.

431
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:00,375
[James] Yeah,
like banging your financier's lady,

432
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:02,666
who's also supposed
to be the star of your film.

433
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,750
[Pete] Whoa! The plot thickens.

434
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:07,708
- Who is she?
- [Pete] You mean who was she?

435
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,666
She's dead. Her
boyfriend did it.

436
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:13,541
Boy what kind of mess he did on her,
you know.

437
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:15,750
Cut her every which way.

438
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:19,625
- Only the bastard demon have the guts to do it himself.
- [clicking tongue]

439
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:23,541
[dramatic music playing]

440
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:26,750
[Electronic buzzing]

441
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:31,416
[distorted voices]

442
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:38,125
[woman 4] Archie,
they're after you, baby.

443
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:43,083
Listen to me,
you have two paths, Archie.

444
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:46,000
You have to
choose the right one.

445
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:50,666
You don't want to go with
them. They can't be trusted.

446
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:52,666
Those weren't cops.

447
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:54,750
Don't fall for their tricks.

448
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:59,916
Go to the El Rancho Motel
tonight and you will remember me.

449
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:03,250
[gasps] [distorted voice] Tonight,
you're coming with us.

450
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,291
Fuck!

451
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:07,291
[gunshot]

452
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,958
Oh, ooh fuck!

453
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,833
[laughing]

454
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:17,000
You can't kill me, you fool.

455
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:21,125
[laughing]

456
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:29,916
[electronic buzzing]

457
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:33,166
[Retrovision] Wake up, Archie.

458
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:37,875
We have been searching
for you for so long,

459
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:40,500
but this is your chance.

460
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:45,291
This is your chance
to finally be set free.

461
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:00,708
Open your mind.

462
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,625
[imitating monkey chattering]

463
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:06,500
[Thana] This is
how you kill a birdie.

464
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:09,333
Get her in the tub.

465
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:10,416
Action.

466
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:12,208
[Birdie whimpers]

467
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:15,333
[snarls]

468
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,291
Jughead wants
his cigarettes back.

469
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:25,833
- You see Jughead, tell him I stole his cigarette.
- [gasps]

470
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:27,666
[Archie] Birdie.

471
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,875
[Thana] Fuck!

472
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:40,666
[Retrovision] Watch closely,
Archie. This is how you died.

473
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,708
I really thought the birds
understood my chirps.

474
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,125
My dad said, "Anne you spend all
your time talking to the damn birds,

475
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:51,434
- you should have been born with a beak."
- [chuckles softly]

476
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:55,583
So he gave me the nickname Birdie
Anne and it kind of stuck, I guess.

477
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,333
Well, she doesn't have a beak,
but I'll tell you one thing,

478
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:05,708
she's got superb acting skills and
she's ready to fly all over Hollywood.

479
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,375
Now,
what's the name of this flick?

480
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:12,666
- The film is called Retrovision.
- Oh, wow.

481
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,666
- [Wren] Retrovision?
- [Birdie] I like that.

482
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:19,041
Weird title, but,
hey, if it's good.

483
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:21,208
Well, I, for one,
think the title is very unique.

484
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,958
We read it and I am...

485
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,791
um, we're real excited
about the role I'll be playing.

486
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,291
We had a problem with
the love scene though.

487
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:32,541
We would like you to make
it a bit more suggestive.

488
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:36,791
I'm not too comfortable seeing my
little Birdie acting in a provocative way.

489
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:39,541
[chuckles] Wren's
a jealous boyfriend.

490
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,791
Look, I'll do whatever is
necessary to be in your film

491
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:45,500
as long as it's done
in an artistic way.

492
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:49,750
Oh, yeah. Sure. Very classy.

493
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:52,625
Well, I'm the one with the cash
cannon shooting dollar bills around,

494
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:55,041
so this better be a
professional shoot.

495
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:58,291
I don't want to find out
I was funding a porno,

496
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,833
but anything for
my little Birdie.

497
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:04,333
If she wants to be an actress,
so be it.

498
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,708
So, do I got the part?

499
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:12,666
- You got the part. - Yay!

500
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:15,250
- To the big time.
- [chuckles softly]

501
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:18,166
[clears throat]

502
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:22,833
So, Mr. Archie,
when you become a big film director

503
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:28,375
will you let it be known all over
Tinseltown that Wren made you who you are?

504
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:33,166
I'll shout it from the rooftops.

505
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:35,083
[all chuckle]

506
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:37,375
Maybe we'll make a
Wren biopic one day,

507
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,541
about a self-made...

508
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,000
[screams]

509
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,958
What's wrong with her?

510
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,958
Hey, hey, hey. Shh, shh. No,
no, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.

511
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,916
There's nothing to be scared
of. There's nothing there, okay.

512
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:51,833
Hush little Birdie,
don't say a word.

513
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:56,208
Poppa's going to buy
you a role in a movie.

514
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:59,041
What's happening? Is...

515
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,125
she getting into
character or...?

516
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,125
This will kill me.

517
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:10,791
Honey, no, no. Never, never.

518
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:14,458
You're mine.

519
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,083
I'll never let anyone hurt you,
not even me.

520
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,208
Ed, Ed will be calling you to...

521
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:29,916
work out the legal stuff.

522
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:35,666
[Birdie] They say
I can play the part.

523
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,833
Who are they?

524
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,125
[Wren] Babe,
he already knows that.

525
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:44,833
I'll let you do anything you
want if it makes you happy.

526
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:47,125
Of course,
you can play the part.

527
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:51,416
[suspenseful music playing]

528
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:54,750
[sighs]

529
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:59,083
Can I tell you a story, Archie?

530
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,375
Yeah, sure.

531
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:08,500
Let's call it the unfortunate
bad fortune of Dr. Mind Fuck.

532
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:14,083
- Sounds like a knockoff.
- [laughs] Oh, you'll like him.

533
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:18,916
There once was a shrink
named Dr. Mind Fuck,

534
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:22,416
who was treating a certain
woman with a mental disorder.

535
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:29,250
She started seeing things that weren't
there like this bug that talks to her.

536
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:33,083
So the doctor
decided to help her

537
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:36,916
and she believed that he
can make this bug go away.

538
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:41,500
But the bug had already planted
its roots into her beautiful mind

539
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:46,000
and the doc's experiments,
they made her much worse.

540
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:52,916
Her true love knew this and
he just had to stop this evil doc.

541
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:59,166
One day Dr. Fr... I
mean Dr. Mind Fuck

542
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:00,625
went on a fishing trip.

543
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:06,750
He had an accident and just
like that he became the fish food.

544
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,083
Don't be like Dr. Mind Fuck.

545
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:15,291
I... I would... Never.

546
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:21,291
Good and keep it
professional with my Birdie.

547
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:25,208
Maybe then you won't
become another cautionary tale.

548
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,583
[suspenseful music playing]

549
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:48,041
[birds chirping]

550
00:51:58,375 --> 00:51:59,916
There you go.

551
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:05,250
I know. I know.

552
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,958
Look, calm down, Ed.

553
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:20,458
He turns out to be a reptilian humanoid,
we always have Donnie the investor.

554
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:25,166
[Wren] So, let's talk.

555
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:35,750
Ed said that you want
80% ownership of my film.

556
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:40,416
100,
I want 100% ownership of your film

557
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:44,125
and fuck Ed,
this is all about you and me.

558
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,125
100%!

559
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:50,375
What the hell are
you talking about?

560
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:09,458
So, here's the spill.

561
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:14,416
I want to fund your
movie and then shelf it.

562
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:16,000
[scoffs]

563
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:20,041
[Archie] You're fucking with me,
right?

564
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:24,416
No,
no. I know what you're thinking.

565
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:26,583
Why would I want
to shelf my film?

566
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:28,833
[laughs]

567
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:32,250
Of course, you'd ask that,
you poor little man.

568
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:37,500
- Well, here it is, Birdie is addicting.
- [Birdie] Sighs.

569
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:38,958
She's my...

570
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:45,833
I don't know, crack,
but she has left me before it.

571
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,708
Well, I can't have that, Archie.

572
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,625
I need my control back.

573
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:57,875
How would shelfing my
film help you with that?

574
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,333
If I own the film, I own her.

575
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:05,000
She doesn't have to
know the film is shelved.

576
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,583
I'm her manager and her agent.

577
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:11,458
As far as she knows I'm just shopping
around town like a hungry shark.

578
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:16,458
Plus, she needs something
to do to keep her sane, saner.

579
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,208
But you're not going to shop it?

580
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:29,166
Maybe at some point...

581
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:31,041
but until then

582
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:35,250
I'm just going to dangle your
script like a carrot on a stick.

583
00:54:35,291 --> 00:54:37,041
You're out of your fucking mind,

584
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:39,041
if you think I'm going
to give up my film,

585
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:42,083
so you can play your sick
twisted game with your girlfriend.

586
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:47,083
What do I look like to you?
A goddamn circus monkey?

587
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:52,500
[cackling]

588
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:57,333
Hold that thought,
Curious George.

589
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:07,000
Big Pie give me a call if
you change your mind, okay.

590
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:41,625
[clapping]

591
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:50,333
Hey, yo, Tony. Hurry it up.

592
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:54,583
Come on, come on, come on. Uh...

593
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:57,208
Really? Really?

594
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:02,291
[suspenseful music playing]

595
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,958
[cellphone vibrates]

596
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:10,958
[Wren] Big Pie,
hey. How've you been?

597
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,416
I'm sorry I didn't
quite catch that.

598
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,583
You sound like
you've got a cold.

599
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:20,375
Your voice seems
a little hoarse.

600
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:24,833
Change of heart, really?

601
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:27,083
You know what? You
don't need to answer that.

602
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:30,125
You're a sensible guy. I know.

603
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:32,625
Okay, we will talk soon though,
okay?

604
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:34,625
Oh, and for your sore throat...

605
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:37,000
- [inaudible] - [choking]

606
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,250
[laughs]

607
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:44,500
Oh,
I sure hope Big Pie gets well real soon.

608
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:48,583
So tomorrow night I'm
hosting this gentleman's party.

609
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:52,333
You should come. We
are making a flick after all.

610
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:56,333
It'll be at my friend's place and
it has an underground dungeon.

611
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:59,875
We'll celebrate and party like
rock stars before we burn out.

612
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:07,916
Tell you what? Rip up the
check and walk away or cash it.

613
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:11,166
I'll be checking my bank
account to see your decision.

614
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,125
When's the last time you ever got fifty thousand
dollars for being a director, let alone 50.

615
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:30,000
Think about it and maybe then I'll see
you at my little shindig tomorrow night.

616
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:37,916
One more thing, when you do show up
could you bring your video camera with you?

617
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:40,458
I've got something I
want you to record for me.

618
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,916
It'll be real special.

619
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:44,625
Can you do this for me?

620
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:51,250
I got this sneaking little feeling
you'll make a special appearance.

621
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:54,500
[Mary] I need to talk to you.

622
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,458
What's going on?

623
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:02,333
I can't get a hold of Ed.

624
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:03,833
It's not like him.

625
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,875
I think something's wrong.

626
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,541
Tell me what happened?

627
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:11,916
Ed, he got a call from an investor,
Donnie.

628
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:15,291
He was so excited. This
was yesterday afternoon.

629
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:19,666
Donnie said yes, he wants to
fund your guys' movie, the whole bit.

630
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:24,000
There's no way he wouldn't
have called you by now.

631
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:25,708
[sighs]

632
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,458
Damn it, Ed.

633
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:32,500
It's Wren.

634
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:35,291
I knew it. He's a
fucking maniac.

635
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:40,125
Oh, dear.

636
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:43,083
What'd you guys
get yourselves into?

637
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:44,458
I know.

638
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:50,541
Wren told me this
cautionary tale.

639
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:56,875
It alluded to the fact that if I
ever crossed him, he would kill me.

640
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:00,416
What are you going to do?

641
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,375
Look...

642
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:10,958
just keep calling Ed.

643
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,083
Call Donnie, too.

644
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:17,208
Tell him...

645
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:23,500
I still want to make
the Retrovisionfilm.

646
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:28,791
I'm ending this deal.

647
00:59:30,916 --> 00:59:33,041
One more thing...

648
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:37,375
look up any shrinks that
might have gone missing...

649
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:40,958
that they're in...
on a fishing trip.

650
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,250
Okay.

651
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,291
Look, Archie.

652
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,916
My dad, he's a big gun guy

653
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:54,416
and he insists on me having an
arsenal just in case the world ends.

654
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:57,541
There's a gun in here.

655
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,458
Just in case.

662
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,458
[Mary over phone] Hey,
Archie. I got some news.

663
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,166
It seems that Dr. Fred Reed recently
died in a boating accident while fishing.

664
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:51,458
[Pete] He threatened Fred to
stop treating Birdie's mental state,

665
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,750
but she kept having hallucinations
of an insect that spoke to her.

666
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:57,416
I'm only here for you to face your fears,
buddy,

667
01:00:57,458 --> 01:01:00,625
which happens to be
death and I get paid for it.

668
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:03,541
My brother was very
intrigued by the case.

669
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:06,250
He wanted to help her,
so he started treating her.

670
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:10,791
How would you like, I tell you a story to
calm you down before I fucking kill you.

671
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,708
Wren, he put a stop to all that.

672
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:15,416
He kept showing up at the grocery store,
the parking lot.

673
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:20,208
That's the end of the story except for
the fact that we got some boots for you.

674
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,291
We bought you boots.

675
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:26,291
You're going to wear these boots
and you're going to go swimming. Huh?

676
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:28,625
He came in with a film script.

677
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:32,666
It was entitled the Dead Shrinkin
bold font right on the cover.

678
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:34,458
He started reading it out loud

679
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,458
and it was about a
corrupt psychiatrist

680
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,625
that was messing with
the mind of an innocent girl.

681
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:42,250
You remember,
when you were a kid and you'd go to sleep

682
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:44,375
and you thought there
were monsters under the bed.

683
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:47,083
Well, there were. [laughs]

684
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:50,333
The last thing he said to
my brother before he left

685
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:53,916
was don't steal the
little sheep from the wolf.

686
01:01:53,958 --> 01:01:56,750
He'll eat you. He'll
eat you real good.

687
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,083
Wren invited me.

688
01:02:07,666 --> 01:02:11,250
- [man 8] Archie.
- Yeah, that's me.

689
01:02:11,291 --> 01:02:17,208
Welcome to my house of pain, pleasure and
whatever the hell else Wren uses it for.

690
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:19,458
Thanks for letting me in.

691
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,416
Hold on little, doggie.

692
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:23,166
I'll let you in the doggy door,

693
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:25,541
but, first,
I need to know one thing.

694
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:29,250
How many years has that
stick been stuck up your ass?

695
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:31,291
[laughs]

696
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:36,250
Relax, it's a party.

697
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:38,916
It's downstairs.

698
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,833
[tense music playing]

699
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:43,583
[man 9] Sit down.

700
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:50,208
[music fades]

701
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:07,708
[Wren] Gentlemen,
may I please have everyone's attention.

702
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,291
I'm getting into
the movie business.

703
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:15,166
[laughs]

704
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:28,333
Clap, clap,
clap your hands director.

705
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:30,041
You are the artist.

706
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,875
Clap for your future works.

707
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:38,333
Gentlemen,
may I introduce Archie Finch,

708
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:44,375
director extraordinaire and
his leading lady, Birdie Anne.

709
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:48,125
[applause]

710
01:04:48,166 --> 01:04:51,500
She will be the Marilyn
Monroe of our times.

711
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,958
- Yes.
- [man 10] How will this help our cause?

712
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:03,708
As all of us watchers here know
Hollywood is the great beast.

713
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:07,125
Its tentacles reach the
farthest corners of the Earth,

714
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:13,625
infecting the minds of the simple,
blinding the minds of the sheeple, right?

715
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:17,625
With their corrupt ideology,
morals, and ethics.

716
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:25,166
So, we must blow up this beast,
slay this dragon.

717
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:30,833
What better way to do it than
by infiltrating its very castle walls.

718
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:33,291
Secret societies
control us like puppets,

719
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:40,041
treat us like cattle and in the end,
they sell us off to the very devil himself.

720
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:44,375
But Birdie Anne
will be our way in.

721
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:50,041
She will sleep in their beds,
be our eyes and ears.

722
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:52,666
Marilyn slept with J.F.K.

723
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:58,125
Birdie Anne will fuck
all of Hollywood to death.

724
01:05:58,166 --> 01:05:59,541
[Birdie] [gasps] What?

725
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:04,125
Oh, babe. Don't look that way.

726
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:07,708
I know what that look is.

727
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,250
It's the bugs on my face,
isn't it?

728
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:13,791
Don't worry, they are harmless.

729
01:06:16,583 --> 01:06:20,375
The bug is talking to
her again in her head.

730
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:26,291
Lately, it's been telling her
that we humans are all insects.

731
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:29,041
Isn't that right, babe?

732
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,708
But we aren't insects.

733
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:38,791
We're men and we
want pleasure from you.

734
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:44,166
An insect couldn't get pleasure from you,
now, could it?

735
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,500
Well, not the kind we seek.

736
01:06:51,666 --> 01:06:54,666
Gentlemen, have at our queen.

737
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:58,958
She will feed her
king and her people.

738
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:04,666
Archie,
did you bring your camera?

739
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:08,291
Push record.

740
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:15,125
[tense music playing]

741
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:41,916
[Archie] Get the
fuck away from her.

742
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:52,000
[Wren] What? Whoa!
What... what's going on?

743
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:55,333
[Archie] Birdie,
come on. We have to leave now.

744
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:56,958
I am free.

745
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,666
[Archie] Where's Ed?

746
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:06,541
Ed? What am I, his keeper?

747
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,833
I don't babysit overgrown douchebags,
Archie.

748
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:13,500
Now let's talk about this bad,
bad thing you just did.

749
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:16,208
[laughs]

750
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:20,291
[suspenseful music playing]

751
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:21,583
Don't you dare.

752
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:25,750
Don't you even think
about taking my birdie.

753
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:29,750
Put her back in her
cage where she belongs.

754
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:32,875
[crying]

755
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:37,791
[grunts] For the love of... Oh,
my God!

756
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:41,750
[melancholy music playing]

757
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:03,708
[breathing heavily]

758
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:18,875
[low beat music playing]

759
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:38,250
Y'all have a good day.

760
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:43,958
[crickets chirping]

761
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:52,416
[car engine revs]

762
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:01,666
[waiter] Hi,
what can I get you two?

763
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,625
Two evil olives, please.

764
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,916
[waiter] Coming right up.

765
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:32,625
Ooh.

766
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,500
It is an evil olive, isn't it?

767
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:37,875
Yeah, you're not kidding.

768
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:39,583
Hardcore little dude.

769
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:42,916
My best friend.

770
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:50,375
She gives me sweet ignorance for a minute,
but it doesn't last much longer than that.

771
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:55,333
You could be anywhere doing
anything and just pop out of nowhere.

772
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:58,833
I have no control over
my life because of it.

773
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:01,583
[rustling]

774
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:03,166
[somber music playing]

775
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:05,375
I don't even know who I am.

776
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:10,583
Completely and utterly
consumed by this thing.

777
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:17,916
I hear these voices in my head giving
me directions and I have to follow them.

778
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:20,000
It's like I don't have a choice.

779
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,666
The... the bug.

780
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:40,666
[distorted voice]
He's right there.

781
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,125
Make it go away.
Please make it go away.

782
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:58,625
The mysterious ace card.

783
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:05,375
Some people believe that
this card represents... death.

784
01:12:05,416 --> 01:12:06,666
Hmm.

785
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:10,833
- In the Vietnam War...
- [coughs]

786
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:15,833
...Americans would place
the ace card on enemy soldiers

787
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:20,041
to have a psychological
impact when they found them.

788
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:22,250
Hmm, riveting,

789
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:25,833
but I must say, I think my trophy
will knock yours out of the water.

790
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:28,750
- Oh, really? Do tell. - Okay.

791
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:32,458
[chuckles]

792
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,750
Easy.

793
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:38,916
What? That was my joker face.

794
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:42,541
- Well, it definitely wasn't your poker face.
- [chuckles]

795
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:45,250
That shit was
downright otherworldly.

796
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:48,000
See,
this is why I should be famous.

797
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:49,791
No CGI needed here.

798
01:12:53,291 --> 01:12:54,625
[chuckles]

799
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:58,166
[laughing]

800
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:04,000
Anyways,
the joker card was first introduced in 1862

801
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:07,375
and was actually first
depicted as a tiger.

802
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:11,041
Really? Does that mean
you have a tiger face, too?

803
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:15,583
- I don't know if you could be trusted with that one yet.
- Oh, come on.

804
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:20,583
[sighs] Tell you what? I'll show
you mine if you show me yours.

805
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:28,333
- Okay. - [chuckles]

806
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:30,333
In a show of solidarity,

807
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,875
we'll raise our shot glasses,

808
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:39,250
take a shot and then
reveal our finest tiger faces.

809
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,375
Okay.

810
01:13:48,166 --> 01:13:50,416
All right. Ready when you are.

811
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:51,541
[clink]

812
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:58,291
[coughs]

813
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:01,625
[distorted growling]

814
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:05,833
[both laughing]

815
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:46,500
[Birdie] Has your
monkey won any?

816
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:48,083
[chuckles]

817
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:52,750
Hey, Archie.

818
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:57,125
I know it's been a week,
but I'm so shaken up over the whole thing.

819
01:14:57,166 --> 01:15:02,041
I mean if you hadn't been there,
I don't know what would have happened.

820
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:09,625
I know it's what I had to do.

821
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,375
[sighs] Why do
you have to leave?

822
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:21,333
Ed's my best friend.

823
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:24,708
I understand.

824
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:34,541
Go to the hotel.

825
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:36,625
It's probably the safest place.

826
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,541
Are you sure the hotel
is the safest place?

827
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:43,500
That place gives me the creeps.

828
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:50,791
I have to do some
detective stuff.

829
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:56,416
- Batman shit. - [chuckles]

830
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:59,000
Well then, you need a Robin?

831
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:04,791
Just promise me you'll be safe.

832
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:09,458
When all this blows over...

833
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:12,708
when everything's figured out...

834
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:17,250
we'll go to a beach
of your choice.

835
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:20,083
- I like that idea.
- Get Mai Tais.

836
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:21,416
[chuckles]

837
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:27,416
[traffic noises]

838
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,458
[Retrovision] I want you
two to get into her room.

839
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,458
Once you have her secured,
bring in the rest of the ghouls

840
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:43,291
and make sure before you kill her, to bathe
her in that gallon of pig blood I gave you.

841
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:46,625
[Birdie gasping]

842
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:53,041
No, no, no, no, no please, no.

843
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:55,416
[gasping]

844
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,333
No, no, no, no. Please, no.

845
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:10,125
[dramatic music playing]

846
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:17,000
[screams]

847
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:23,416
No, no, no, no.

848
01:17:23,458 --> 01:17:27,916
[panting]

849
01:17:35,916 --> 01:17:38,666

[Birdie panting]

852
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:05,625
[Wren] Film it. Film it all.
She's going to be a star after all.

853
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:08,500
And as for Archie, don't worry.

854
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:10,541
I sent a snake after him.

855
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:15,416
Today will still be beautiful.

856
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:18,708
[cackling]

857
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:25,250
[low beat music playing]

858
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:34,541
[Archie] Ed, man. Where are you?

859
01:18:34,583 --> 01:18:38,416
[suspenseful music playing]

860
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:53,083
I'm super excited about this
investor. Let's make Retrovision.

861
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:57,166
You're my guy. Yeah,
get back to me.

862
01:18:58,041 --> 01:18:59,875
Text me or something.

863
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:08,375
[doorbell rings]

864
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:15,333
- Mary, how are you sweetie?
- I'm good.

865
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:18,333
I'm just coming
to check on Archie.

866
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:22,708
That's what I figured 'cause ain't
nobody want to visit an aging bat like me

867
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,750
- that's for damn sure.
- [laughs]

868
01:19:24,791 --> 01:19:27,541
Um,
how's his physical therapy going?

869
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:31,166
Good. Real good. He's starting to
remember little things here and there.

870
01:19:31,208 --> 01:19:32,708
He's in his room.

871
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,750
[fly buzzing]

872
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:40,208
[whistle blows]

873
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:44,125
[Mary] So how's your memory?

874
01:19:44,166 --> 01:19:46,666
Remember anything new?

875
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:50,500
[dramatic music playing]

876
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,458
Hey,
it'll... it'll come back to you.

877
01:20:10,125 --> 01:20:13,666
[whistle blows]

878
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:28,208
Archie, you scared me.

879
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:31,041
I thought you were
the living dead.

880
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:33,833
You need a shower.
You're bringing in the flies.

881
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:35,666
They gravitate towards...

882
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,291
Well,
it's obvious you ain't hearing me.

883
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:41,958
Looks like I'm going to have to
spray you down with Febreze.

884
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,833
I'm left no choice.

885
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:48,666
You have dad's belt buckle?

886
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:51,583
I've been saving it for you.

887
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:54,166
Now, you're not going to sell it,
are you?

888
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:58,208
Because if that's the case, I'm going to
just keep it here where it's nice and safe.

889
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,541
I'm not going to sell it.

890
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:04,791
Okay, but I'm trusting you.

891
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:14,541
[voices echoing]

892
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:18,458
[dramatic music playing]

893
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:29,125
[music stops playing]

894
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:39,375
Retrovision,
hey. What's that about?

895
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:44,791
Let me guess. How we should
learn from our past mistakes.

896
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:47,416
Chicken crap. Give me that.

897
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:52,458
No good alligator hugging,
cow tipping, donkey ride.

898
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:56,708
Who do you think
you are? Horseshit.

899
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:01,958
Hey, Archie.

900
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:05,041
Don't listen to that man.

901
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:10,041
This script is going to make
for a fine movie one day.

902
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:21,208
[birds chirping]

903
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,767
[man 11] Hey,
what you doing with that mannequin.

904
01:23:34,791 --> 01:23:37,625
Hey, look,
the yard sale was over yesterday, buddy.

905
01:23:37,666 --> 01:23:40,375
Hey, come back here. I want
money for that. I want money.

906
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:44,208
Come back here. Come back here.

907
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,166
[dog barks]

908
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:49,250
What else did he take?

909
01:23:57,916 --> 01:24:02,000
[intense music]

910
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:12,208
[Archie] Look at
dreams. I can't stay.

911
01:24:38,666 --> 01:24:42,250
[laughing]

912
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:55,583
[gunshot]

913
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:59,541
[reel whirring]

914
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:19,500
[Retrovision] Open your mind.

915
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:21,791
[laughing]

916
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:33,541
["Fur Elise" by
Beethoven playing]

917
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:43,083
[distorted voice]

918
01:25:46,625 --> 01:25:48,541
[gasps]

919
01:25:57,833 --> 01:26:00,875
[Retrovision] Allow
me to introduce myself.

920
01:26:00,916 --> 01:26:06,083
I am a Psychopomp
starring as Retrovision,

921
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:10,458
the title and character from a
script you wrote while on Earth.

922
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:16,333
Me and my cast reenacted
elements and people from your past life

923
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:21,750
in order to wake you up from
your false belief that you were alive.

924
01:26:21,791 --> 01:26:26,125
This here is not a
physical plane as it seems.

925
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:31,666
These are ghost sets of actual
places you had been to on Earth.

926
01:26:31,708 --> 01:26:36,708
One of my best actors
playing your friend Birdie Anne

927
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:41,416
triggered a memory which
resulted in you realizing the truth.

928
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:48,125
This gave us the right to guide you
to your final destination in the afterlife,

929
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:53,750
but we weren't the only ones that were
trying to pull you out of this time loop.

930
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:57,416
Dark insects had
assembled their own cast,

931
01:26:57,458 --> 01:27:02,208
but with the intention of
taking you to the dark place.

932
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:06,375
But now that you know
the truth you must leave.

933
01:27:06,416 --> 01:27:10,291
The insects are crafty
and could still trick you.

934
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:13,125
This motel door
is really a gate.

935
01:27:13,166 --> 01:27:15,208
You must walk through it.

936
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:19,333
Do it now before
the loop closes.

937
01:27:28,291 --> 01:27:32,208
[scraping]

938
01:27:35,916 --> 01:27:39,208
Job well done.

939
01:27:42,041 --> 01:27:45,916
[tranquil music playing]

940
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:53,708
[Archie] What do you want
our story to be now, Birdie?

941
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:13,875
[music fades]

942
01:28:13,916 --> 01:28:18,916
[suspenseful music playing]
