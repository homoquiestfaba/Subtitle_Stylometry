1
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:35,127
(beeping)

2
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,755
Taryn.

3
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:39,268
I know you're close to unlocking the
secrets of Quarran III.

4
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:40,736
That's right, Zhanna.

5
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,737
You taught me well.

6
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:44,734
There may still be a place for you in the
Empir e.

7
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,934
A Seer is always...

8
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,504
...useful.

9
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:50,512
My visions are my own now.

10
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,781
Are your troops ready ?

11
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:55,783
Yes, my lady.

12
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:57,513
The garrison on Corellia is on standby

13
00:01:57,654 --> 00:01:58,985
and awaits your order.

14
00:01:59,422 --> 00:01:59,979
Very well.

15
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:02,882
The artifact is the priority.

16
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:05,626
And Taryn Anwar?

17
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:07,321
I leave that to you.

18
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,328
I understand.

19
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:12,724
The ambition of the Emperor's Hand
clouds her purpose.

20
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,463
She may yet be of some use to me.

21
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:16,401
My lord.

22
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,235
Alert our contacts near the Corellian
system.

23
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:23,904
They are to observe only. No action is to
be taken.

24
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:25,411
Is that clear?

25
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:26,480
As you wish, my lord.

26
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:54,233
(beeping)

27
00:03:55,772 --> 00:04:01,904
(alien language)

28
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,479
Private business. Open the lift.

29
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:09,409
(alien language)

30
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,113
(alien language)

31
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:15,654
(alien language)

32
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:45,855
(muted club music)

33
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:48,850
(driving club music)

34
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:58,868
(crowd chatter)

35
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,879
(club music fades out)

36
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:25,091
(alien whispers)

37
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:26,594
(club music fades in)

38
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:38,097
Whoa, beautiful! How 'bout joining us?

39
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:39,731
Sorry, I'm not very good company
tonight.

40
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:41,667
Whatever the lady says.

41
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:46,214
Struck out again, eh, Commander?

42
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,982
Ah, maybe I did and maybe I didn't.

43
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:55,324
(alien language)

44
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:56,988
Get lost.

45
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:58,651
(alien language)

46
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:00,955
She said take a hike.

47
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:05,457
(alien language)

48
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:10,532
I have what you want.

49
00:06:14,577 --> 00:06:15,805
I believe you're right.

50
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:19,912
Was that r eally necessary?

51
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:22,948
Yeah.

52
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:26,650
Here's our girl. Told you she'd be prompt.

53
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:30,519
- You picked up a partner?
- You could say that.

54
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:32,394
Taryn, this is Cade. A friend.

55
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:35,531
Do you have it?

56
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,133
Yes... and...

57
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:37,899
...no.

58
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:38,862
Yes, we have it...

59
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:40,865
...and no. It's not his to give.

60
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:41,700
It's mine.

61
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:42,864
You lied to me.

62
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,166
Declan here tells me you'r e a Seer.

63
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,635
I need you to unlock the artifact.

64
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:49,802
I wouldn't take much stock in what he
says.

65
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:52,014
And I don't work with others. Not
anymor e.

66
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:53,115
Listen...

67
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:57,512
(club music fades into haunting choral
music)

68
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:40,191
(blaster fire)

69
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:46,695
(blaster fire)

70
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:53,042
(club music fades in)

71
00:07:53,142 --> 00:07:55,702
- You'll work with me 'cause it was your
sister's dying wish.

72
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:58,539
You know, I knew Raux very well.

73
00:07:58,648 --> 00:08:00,115
You'r e nothing like her.

74
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:03,007
You know wher e to find me.

75
00:08:05,555 --> 00:08:07,182
Who is he and how does he know Raux?

76
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:08,791
You'll have to ask him

77
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:10,792
and you'll have plenty of time on the way
to Quarran III.

78
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:12,228
I won't work with him.

79
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:13,562
I don't trust him.

80
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:15,164
(Boushh speaking in Ubese)

81
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,700
Right. We'll take it from here. Let's go.

82
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:19,398
It's clear the feeling is mutual.

83
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:26,532
Taryn Anwar.

84
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:30,772
You are her eby under arrest for
treasonous acts against the Empire.

85
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,778
Now, Sergeant, I'm sure you can
understand why I can't accompany you.

86
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:35,211
I can shoot you here.

87
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:36,279
But you won't.

88
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,714
Stand down Commander. This is Imperial
business.

89
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:42,148
CorSec is still the reigning authority here.

90
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:44,989
I have reinforcements on the way.

91
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:47,129
I say again, Commander. Stand down.

92
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,397
Is there a back door to this place?

93
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:50,399
Unfortunately... no.

94
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:53,227
Declan?

95
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:54,361
Run!

96
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:23,962
VO: All fighters... man to deploy.

97
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:29,905
You could time that better. I signaled you
a while ago.

98
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:31,202
Switch over.

99
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:33,475
She's all yours.

100
00:09:33,943 --> 00:09:35,410
And you'r e lucky I got here at all.

101
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:38,013
Your friend her e kicked up quite
a bit of Imperial interest.

102
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:39,541
There's patrols everywher e.

103
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:42,682
What about my ship?

104
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:44,047
Consider it impounded.

105
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:51,683
Two destroyers coming in fast.

106
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:52,553
I see 'em.

107
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:54,654
Switching auxiliary power to forward
shields.

108
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:56,131
We're in tractor range.

109
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:57,162
Not for long.

110
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:03,266
VO: Disable ship in sector 73.

111
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:04,773
VO: Do not destroy.

112
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,847
We have fighters approaching.

113
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:13,115
Take the aft guns.

114
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,540
VO: All TIES... disable fugitive fr eighter.

115
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:23,517
Roger. I have them.

116
00:11:00,963 --> 00:11:02,590
Well, this has gone on long enough.

117
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:04,566
Let's see how well they fly.

118
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,329
I've alr eady taken the shipyard tour.

119
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:51,262
That should push the bounty up on me.

120
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:56,940
And we're clear.

121
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:01,746
I want some answers. Who are
you and where is that artifact?

122
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:03,545
You know, I r eally don't care what you
want.

123
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:03,915
Hey!

124
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:08,612
Have I ever doubted you? When you
came to me when you found out who
Zhanna was?

125
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:10,852
Did I hesitate, for even a moment?

126
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:14,257
And you.

127
00:13:14,297 --> 00:13:16,060
How many times have I risked my life...

128
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:19,795
and my ship... for one of Raux's visions?

129
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:23,394
Now it's a long two day trip to Quarran III.

130
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:25,831
You two are supposed to be Jedi.

131
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:28,276
Try acting like it.

132
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:37,116
So.

133
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:39,845
How'd you meet my sister?

134
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:43,118
How did you end up working for the
Emperor's Hand?

135
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:46,328
Zhanna was a Jedi.

136
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:49,060
How was I supposed to know
she was a traitor to the Order?

137
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:51,599
You know, I always thought a Seer
would be mor e... perceptive.

138
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:55,902
Raux didn't see it. And
Zhanna trained her in secret.

139
00:13:56,005 --> 00:13:56,903
You know what, you're lying.

140
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:57,935
Raux is a Jedi.

141
00:13:58,608 --> 00:13:59,734
Not in the eyes of the Order.

142
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:02,110
My sister left the Temple at 13.

143
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:05,346
The Council felt her visions made her...
unstable...

144
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:07,612
...unsuitable for further training.

145
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,217
So you took her to Zhanna?

146
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,647
She offered. She was a friend, I trusted
her.

147
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:16,322
Look.

148
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:19,691
I thought I was helping to restore the Jedi
Order.

149
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:21,221
But she lied to me.

150
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:23,432
She used me.

151
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,461
No one hates Zhanna mor e than I do.

152
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:29,398
And I don't need a total stranger

153
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:30,769
passing judgment on me.

154
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:33,764
I know what I've done.

155
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:40,908
That seemed to go well.

156
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:45,013
I thought I told you to ease up on her.

157
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:46,013
Yeah, well.

158
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,356
Listen.

159
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:49,483
When Raux...

160
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:54,994
When Raux... died. I've been trying to
understand why.

161
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:58,655
Have I ever doubted you? When you
came to me when you found out who
Zhanna was?

162
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:02,269
And then I find that Zhanna trained Raux.

163
00:15:03,773 --> 00:15:04,899
But what does it mean?

164
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:07,940
Now with her gone...

165
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:11,236
...what am I supposed to believe in now?

166
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:15,984
Tell me this.

167
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,680
Do you still believe in Raux's visions?

168
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:20,452
Without fail.

169
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:22,588
Well then, maybe...

170
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:24,553
...she saw a bigger picture.

171
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:35,900
What is thy bidding, my master?

172
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:40,475
I sense much anger in you, Lord Vader.

173
00:15:40,843 --> 00:15:43,073
Directed at the Emperor's Hand.

174
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,274
She has an agenda, my master.

175
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,212
I am unclear if it is in your best inter est.

176
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:54,519
That is why I have you.

177
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,389
Yes, my master.

178
00:15:59,428 --> 00:15:59,985
Lord Vader.

179
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,157
Too many Jedi have been eluding you
lately.

180
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,627
Make sure that your efforts in the
Outer Rim are mor e... productive.

181
00:16:09,371 --> 00:16:11,168
As you wish.

182
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:20,972
(crowd noises)

183
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:23,852
(R2-D2 beeps)

184
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:36,431
(crowd falls silent)

185
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:49,073
(ominous music)

186
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,348
I come with a message from the Emperor.

187
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:01,921
Senators.

188
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:03,718
Honored delegates.

189
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:11,065
You have the distinct honor of assisting
me in bringing peace and order to our
troubled galaxy.

190
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:14,134
I have given system and sector control to
the Moffs.

191
00:17:14,203 --> 00:17:17,172
(outraged gasps)
- All commerce and travel will now be
regulated

192
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:22,970
by the Empir e for the safety
and benefit of its loyal citizens.

193
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:25,304
In your eagerness to comply

194
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:30,146
I have complete faith that order
will reign in your home worlds.

195
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,817
Immediately.

196
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:33,855
- This is preposterous!

197
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:36,254
By what right... (chokes)

198
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:39,986
By the right of the Emperor's wishes.

199
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:41,396
(death rattle)

200
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:47,625
The Emperor thanks you for your
continued loyalty to the Empire.

201
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:05,051
Escort our guests to their home worlds
and see to it that the transfer of power is
complete.

202
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:23,968
Yes, what is it?

203
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,436
My lady.

204
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:28,333
Taryn Anwar has escaped.

205
00:18:28,844 --> 00:18:31,312
We discovered her contact, a smuggler
named Declan.

206
00:18:31,614 --> 00:18:33,309
She's on board his ship and we believe...

207
00:18:33,382 --> 00:18:35,213
Does she have the artifact?

208
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:36,142
- We believe so.

209
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:39,785
- However, our troops have encountered
some unexpected resistance from the
local militia.

210
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:43,453
But we'd been able to determine that the
ship set course for the Quarran system.

211
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,288
Ready my ship.

212
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:48,028
Alert my crew.

213
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:49,030
My lady?

214
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:51,990
I will retrieve this piece in person.

215
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:55,034
And I will have the pleasure of
dealing with Taryn Anwar

216
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:56,036
myself.

217
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:57,034
Yes, my lady.

218
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:04,874
I think you should see this.

219
00:19:14,723 --> 00:19:15,985
I'm sorry we left without you

220
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:18,390
but Declan, it's here. I can feel it.

221
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,224
It's not clear yet
but it will be once I'm on Keishing.

222
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:22,522
No matter what

223
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:25,123
you and Cade need to get the holocron
to Taryn.

224
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:26,792
She's the next step.

225
00:19:28,637 --> 00:19:29,695
You and Cade won't like it

226
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:33,435
but I'm willing to do whatever it
takes to ensure the Jedi survive.

227
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:35,201
Taryn will...

228
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:37,809
She'll understand.

229
00:19:38,414 --> 00:19:39,847
This is my choice.

230
00:19:39,982 --> 00:19:41,609
This is the only option.

231
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:44,219
The pickup coordinates are in the nav
computer.

232
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:46,147
Cade will need a lift.

233
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:47,819
And Declan...

234
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:49,923
...don't be late.

235
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:53,987
Raux, what have you done?

236
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:56,361
- Obviously what she felt was right.

237
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:58,529
How long have you been standing there?

238
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:00,529
But you know that's typical of Raux.

239
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:04,438
Always giving orders. No explanations.

240
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,134
Like working for Zhanna.

241
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,244
I r eally don't see how you can compare
the two.

242
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,138
Zhanna would say,

243
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:14,240
"Investigate all reports in the system.

244
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:15,214
Bring who and what you can."

245
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,444
What, you never figured it out?

246
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:20,515
I'm going to say this again.

247
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:22,856
I trusted Zhanna.

248
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:26,689
She was the only one that believed in
my visions of the Temple's destruction.

249
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:27,690
Not the Council.

250
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:29,423
Not anyone else.

251
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:31,297
So when the Temple was destroyed

252
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,228
Zhanna seemed like the only hope.

253
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:34,491
She had a plan.

254
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:38,964
And when the Emperor declared
all Jedi traitors to the Empire,

255
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,908
as we were being hunted down one by
one,

256
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:43,200
she asked me

257
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:45,574
to help her rebuild the Jedi Order in
secret.

258
00:20:47,082 --> 00:20:49,209
I wanted to find Jedi for her.

259
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:51,112
I wanted the Order back.

260
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,351
You never suspected that she was using
you?

261
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:55,154
I started to piece it together,

262
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,988
but it wasn't until she r evealed
herself as the Emperor's Hand...

263
00:20:59,328 --> 00:21:01,353
She wanted me to be part of that.

264
00:21:01,497 --> 00:21:03,465
And that's when I got out.

265
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:13,235
You know she killed every Jedi you ever
found.

266
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:20,972
I know.

267
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:12,590
Welcome to the prison outpost of
Keishing, my lady.

268
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:14,760
- You didn't need to come all this way.
- Commander.

269
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,599
I don't mind getting dirty.

270
00:22:21,877 --> 00:22:22,434
Kneel.

271
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:25,375
Well, since you asked so nicely.

272
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:27,974
And I would have thought six months
would have softened you a bit.

273
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:30,174
Well behold a softened woman.

274
00:22:33,388 --> 00:22:35,117
Put her on board my ship.

275
00:22:35,991 --> 00:22:38,482
Try not to bruise her any more than
necessary.

276
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:41,092
And get her cleaned up.

277
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,162
Yes, my lady.

278
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:58,039
Let's see this holocron.

279
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,519
I've tried to access it but...

280
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:14,058
Well, it's locked.

281
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:18,227
Yes.

282
00:23:22,004 --> 00:23:22,971
There.

283
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:27,634
Over 200 years ago the Council began
efforts

284
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:30,372
to infiltrate and destroy Sukaal's group.

285
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:33,177
Where so many have failed, I've
succeeded.

286
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:36,183
Now I have escaped Quarran III with the
holocron.

287
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:38,949
Without it the Seers are crippled.

288
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:41,413
Duty compels me to return to the Temple

289
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,014
and complete my mission and yet...

290
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:47,056
Maybe Sukaal was right and his
methods are the only way to save us all.

291
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:49,962
Guess he didn't opt for the Temple.

292
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:50,965
Wait... that's it?

293
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:54,035
I mean, that's it? Where's all the power?

294
00:23:55,437 --> 00:23:56,461
On Quarran III.

295
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:59,099
Just like the myth says.

296
00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:13,311
So much devastation.

297
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:19,454
What could have caused so much
damage?

298
00:24:19,928 --> 00:24:21,987
Welcome to the Empire's testing ground.

299
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:15,713
So this is Quarran III.

300
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,087
It's all up to you now.

301
00:25:25,727 --> 00:25:26,591
Lead the way.

302
00:25:28,297 --> 00:25:29,264
We made need these.

303
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:30,154
Right.

304
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:57,782
There's so much energy here.

305
00:25:58,293 --> 00:25:59,385
But it's...

306
00:25:59,928 --> 00:26:01,088
...unfocused.

307
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:02,721
Undirected.

308
00:26:02,831 --> 00:26:03,889
- Well,

309
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:04,988
I don't feel a thing.

310
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,725
- No. It's here.

311
00:26:05,934 --> 00:26:08,801
But it's like the holocron. It...

312
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:10,370
...it needs a Seer to unlock it.

313
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:14,408
- This place looks like it's been here a
while.

314
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,375
- Do you think Sukaal built it?
- No. It was her e long befor e the Seers
came.

315
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:21,714
- Looks like our path is down into these
caves.

316
00:26:21,783 --> 00:26:23,648
- Let's get going.

317
00:27:01,056 --> 00:27:03,524
- You have always been ruled by your
emotions.

318
00:27:09,898 --> 00:27:11,832
That's what makes you so reliable.

319
00:27:13,435 --> 00:27:14,663
Give me the artifact.

320
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,364
No.

321
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,067
Give me the artifact...

322
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:21,138
...or your sister dies.

323
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:25,004
You'r e alive.

324
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,045
Raux. I...

325
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:28,379
- I saw you die.

326
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:30,085
She's got this whole place wired to blow.

327
00:27:30,085 --> 00:27:31,074
She's got this whole place wired to blow.

328
00:27:32,154 --> 00:27:32,950
Let her go.

329
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:35,252
- Lf you let her go...

330
00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:37,586
...I'll activate it for you.

331
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,859
- It takes a Seer of great ability
to activate this chamber.

332
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:43,529
And that's not you,

333
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:44,758
is it, Taryn?

334
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:50,136
I took you in when the Jedi threw you
out.

335
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:52,504
Now it's time to repay your debt.

336
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:17,493
(echoing voice)
Download initiated.

337
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:18,731
From where?

338
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:20,059
- This console?

339
00:28:20,302 --> 00:28:21,291
(echoing voice)
No.

340
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:23,101
(echoing voice)
From off-planet.

341
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:27,671
(echoing voice) Everywhere.
Systems. Networks. Ship logs.

342
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,308
(echoing voice)
So much data. Scattered.

343
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,608
These are identity tags. Some sort of
tracking system.

344
00:28:34,716 --> 00:28:36,013
Some of it's old.

345
00:28:36,218 --> 00:28:36,980
That's it?

346
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:38,352
No weapons?

347
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,751
No power?

348
00:28:41,223 --> 00:28:42,747
The message on the artifact.

349
00:28:43,992 --> 00:28:45,653
Raux, search on Sukaal.

350
00:28:46,061 --> 00:28:46,459
(echoing voice)
Got it.

351
00:28:47,362 --> 00:28:48,351
Master Sukaal.

352
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:50,087
My mission was successful.

353
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:53,128
I have eliminated the targets
enroute to the Yavin system

354
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:55,829
before they could join the
mercenary fleet assembling there.

355
00:28:56,304 --> 00:28:58,135
I look forward to my next assignment.

356
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:01,038
My master is dead.

357
00:29:01,343 --> 00:29:04,779
I'm continuing his important work
without the Council's knowledge.

358
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,504
I, too, have seen this vision.

359
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:08,948
This futur e of horrible death and
destruction.

360
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:13,543
The program still runs, buried deep
within the Temple's com systems.

361
00:29:14,222 --> 00:29:16,588
It will run as long as the Temple stands.

362
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:19,788
It is up to us few that remain true to the
goal

363
00:29:19,995 --> 00:29:22,361
to use this program's information.

364
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,957
The darkness that threatens the
galaxy must be destroyed.

365
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:29,064
A secr et order in the Jedi.

366
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:31,835
This r ecording's old enough
to be from the Sith Wars.

367
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:34,431
They must have been hunting Sith.

368
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:36,905
(echoing voice)
I've found Sukaal's recording.

369
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,407
Play it.

370
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:42,741
The Council believes they have
halted my tagging program.

371
00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:45,447
Let them think they've stopped me.

372
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:48,914
They cannot see the truth of my visions.

373
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:52,883
They will not see the truth of my visions.

374
00:29:53,495 --> 00:29:56,896
So many candidates fail to become
apprentices.

375
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:01,032
So many padawans fail their trials.

376
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:05,666
We reject these unpr edictable, untrained
children

377
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:07,368
and loose them upon the galaxy.

378
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:10,374
And still we are shocked

379
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:12,937
when they betray Jedi ideals.

380
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:18,075
My visions grow clearer.

381
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:22,849
One will turn to the Dark side

382
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:24,752
and destroy us all.

383
00:30:26,595 --> 00:30:30,258
I will defy the Council to save the galaxy.

384
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:35,727
I will continue to tag all who seek to
become Jedi.

385
00:30:37,372 --> 00:30:40,341
I will track those who fail

386
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:44,943
and destroy those who turn from the
Light.

387
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,979
Not Sith. Jedi.

388
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:51,877
They were hunting Jedi.

389
00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:53,315
You didn't hunt Jedi.

390
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:55,690
You were trying to help.

391
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,593
Raux, pull up Quarran III.

392
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,169
I seem to be the odd man out.

393
00:31:11,172 --> 00:31:12,196
It's still running.

394
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:15,401
Download all active tags to this console.

395
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:20,311
- Thank you Taryn. You've ensured
my place at the Emperor's side.

396
00:31:21,016 --> 00:31:23,576
Rather than bringing your comrades to
me one by one

397
00:31:23,952 --> 00:31:26,147
you've delivered therest of the Order to
me.

398
00:31:28,757 --> 00:31:29,917
(echoing voice)
Download complete.

399
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,652
(echoing voice)
Deactivating system.

400
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:37,057
Kill them.

401
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:39,967
(lightsaber hum sounds)

402
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:48,799
You talk of paying debts.

403
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:51,735
You owe me your life yet all you've done
is use me.

404
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:55,367
Your visions of the Jedi Temple's
destruction were worthless to me.

405
00:32:55,977 --> 00:32:58,912
I'm alive because I laid the charges
myself.

406
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:12,357
I would leave...

407
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,119
...now.

408
00:33:21,636 --> 00:33:23,433
- What the-
- Don't question it.

409
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:27,102
We've got to get out of her e.

410
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:29,735
Cade will get her. We have to get to the
ship.

411
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,439
You better be right.

412
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:45,687
You won't win.

413
00:33:46,394 --> 00:33:47,622
I already have.

414
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:50,831
Look how far you've strayed from the
Jedi path.

415
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:05,511
I strayed when I followed you.

416
00:34:05,814 --> 00:34:07,782
I didn't make you hide your visions.

417
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,976
I didn't abandon your sister.

418
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,488
Fear and guilt put you on that path.

419
00:34:37,245 --> 00:34:37,802
Taryn!

420
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,081
- We've got to go.
- She's got the disk.

421
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,083
There's no time.

422
00:34:45,353 --> 00:34:46,377
I'll make time.

423
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:48,477
Move.

424
00:34:49,123 --> 00:34:50,283
Move, Cade.

425
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,583
I have to do this.

426
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:55,528
- I've got to make things right.
- You can't follow her for ever.

427
00:34:57,332 --> 00:34:58,356
You have to make a choice.

428
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:01,393
Taryn, let it go.

429
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:12,913
You haven't failed.

430
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:17,410
There's still hope.

431
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:26,216
Don't you ever do that to me again, you
understand?

432
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:32,850
Never again.

433
00:36:33,294 --> 00:36:34,318
It was worth it.

434
00:36:34,495 --> 00:36:35,962
We have a chance now.

435
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:39,057
Declan uploaded the last 100 years
of information from the console.

436
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,158
We now have the location of all the Jedi
that Zhanna has.

437
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:44,404
But Zhanna still has the disk...

438
00:36:44,472 --> 00:36:46,702
It was never about stopping Zhanna.

439
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:49,368
I knew from my visions we
could never save all the Jedi.

440
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:51,272
It was about saving those we could.

441
00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:53,542
But the Empire now has Sukaal's tracking
information.

442
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:55,112
They can finish us off.

443
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,641
Do you realize how many Jedi are going
to die?

444
00:36:57,752 --> 00:36:59,310
Raux, surely in one of your other visions...

445
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:02,854
There were no Jedi in any future I saw but
this one.

446
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:06,087
There's no stopping the Empire
from getting the tagging information.

447
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:08,225
There's still hope, right?

448
00:37:08,863 --> 00:37:09,989
We can save some.

449
00:37:10,598 --> 00:37:11,496
Yes.

450
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:13,061
We will save some.

451
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:26,906
Because of you now I have
the power to destroy the Jedi.

452
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:29,812
They will meet their destiny.

453
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:32,678
You have indeed been useful.

454
00:37:32,887 --> 00:37:35,515
Your service to the Empire is complete.

455
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:40,222
You have served me well.

456
00:37:40,294 --> 00:37:42,694
Your loyalty will be rewarded.

457
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:43,588
My lord.

458
00:37:43,998 --> 00:37:45,431
The fleet is awaiting your orders.

459
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,900
Set your course for Coruscant.

460
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:52,266
I will inform my master there is no longer
any concern

461
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,672
about the Emperor's Hand.

462
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:59,176
As you wish, my lord.

463
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:20,399
How did your meeting with the senator
go?

464
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:22,034
Surprisingly well, actually.

465
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:24,772
Senator Mothma's established quite a
network.

466
00:38:25,406 --> 00:38:26,634
Things ar e starting to happen.

467
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,500
So, where will you go first?

468
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,078
Alderaan.

469
00:38:30,078 --> 00:38:30,476
Alderaan.

470
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:33,309
It seems that Senator Organa
is sympathetic to our cause.

471
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:36,111
We'll need his contacts. And his funding.

472
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:39,015
I'll start rounding up the Jedi.

473
00:38:39,587 --> 00:38:40,679
Getting them on the move.

474
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:43,351
The Empire can't kill what they can't find.

475
00:38:44,392 --> 00:38:45,984
It'll be like old times, eh?

476
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:47,186
Good.

477
00:38:47,462 --> 00:38:49,862
Then I'll head to the Outer Rim
and look up my old friend.

478
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:52,388
I'm sure he can devise a way to r emove
these tags.

479
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,199
May the force be with you.

480
00:38:58,072 --> 00:38:59,403
May the force be with you.

481
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:10,374
I'll meet you on Nar Shadaa.

482
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:13,815
I may be a while.

483
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,214
I'll wait.
