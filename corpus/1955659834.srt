00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:30,050
Party Boat! Party Boat!

3
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:34,342
Attention,
Lake Everett Seniors!

4
00:00:34,383 --> 00:00:39,050
Let's get wild! Let's get weird!
But let's not get pregnant!

5
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:46,258
Party Boat! Party Boat!

6
00:00:47,758 --> 00:00:48,967
Come on! Ha ha!

7
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,592
- Hey, you!
- Oh, man.

8
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,425
Promise me
no one dies tonight!

9
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:55,467
Listen. We are
five years in, my man.

10
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,050
- Nobody's died yet.
- That we know of.

11
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:58,217
If no one dies
on my last night,

12
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,381
I'm gonna be real disappointed.

13
00:00:59,383 --> 00:01:00,548
You've been threatening to quit

14
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,175
for three seasons now, Kiley.

15
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:03,883
I don't think
it's gonna happen.

16
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:05,548
Hey. Did you guys go
to our school?

17
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,592
- No!
- Yes!

18
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:07,717
Best friends since fifth grade.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Fourth! Fourth.

20
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:10,048
We are living proof

21
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,467
that with a little bit of hustle
and some luck...

22
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:13,715
And a predatory loan.

23
00:01:13,717 --> 00:01:16,425
All your dreams
can come true!

24
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:18,967
That is the best dream ever!

25
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,008
- It is. Aim high!
- Whoo!

26
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,717
That's what we do, Sean!
We make dreams come true! Unh.

27
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:39,925
Oh, yeah!

28
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:44,050
Whoo!

29
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:52,550
Three, two, one! Go!

30
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:04,300
- That was pretty cool.
- That was awesome.

31
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:17,758
Hey, guys! Look alive!

32
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:31,050
- Get in there.
- What the hell?

33
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,548
What, do you guys live here?

34
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,175
Oh, yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

35
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:38,675
Sad-cool, maybe?

36
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:41,008
Shut up! Do you know how
much trouble we would get into

37
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,175
if lake patrol boarded us
and found this stash?

38
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:44,758
It's a lot.

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,967
What kind of drugs
are those anyway?

40
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:47,508
Combination Locks.

41
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,842
What the hell is that?

42
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:52,592
It's Adderall mixed with molly
mixed with acid.

43
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:55,217
It's like a combo meal,
extra fries.

44
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,883
Kinda makes
your brain just... lock.

45
00:02:57,925 --> 00:02:59,758
- Hmm.
- Then you're flying high!

46
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,381
Oh, you're flying high, huh?

47
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,383
Too bad we're gonna have to
confiscate them. Give me that!

48
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:05,548
- What?
- That's right.

49
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,758
- You heard me right!
- Get out.

50
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:08,217
- No!
- Back to the party, man.

51
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:09,425
Smoke some weed or something.

52
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:10,842
- Those are the breaks!
- Damn!

53
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:12,217
We definitely have
to take some of these.

54
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,800
We are definitely throwing
those in the lake.

55
00:03:13,842 --> 00:03:15,133
- Awww.
- Immediately.

56
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:16,133
- Sean.
- Max.

57
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:17,467
- Sean.
- Max.

58
00:03:17,508 --> 00:03:18,675
- Sean.
- Max!

59
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:19,717
Fine.

60
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:28,175
Can't waste these.

61
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,175
Who needs aspirin?

62
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,717
You really want to leave
all this behind?

63
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:49,381
Can't be afraid
to move on, Max.

64
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:50,883
But nothing's gonna change,
right?

65
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:52,592
It'll be you and me,
like always.

66
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:55,675
- Always!
- First mates forever!

67
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:20,217
Well, well, well.
Who is this stranger?

68
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:23,092
Ah. It's my birthday bestie!

69
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:24,133
What's up?

70
00:04:25,258 --> 00:04:26,548
Maximus!

71
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,675
- You ready to party tonight?
- Absolutely!

72
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,675
Hey, let me see that rage face!

73
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,881
All right, ditch your fuzzies.
Let's go.

74
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:37,050
Yeah, but I gotta clean
the boat, so...

75
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,383
You never clean the boat.

76
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:43,300
I'll be right down!

77
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:47,508
Uh, did Greg get you
the final guest list?

78
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,383
He did.
And the wine list.

79
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:51,675
And the appetizer list.
And the playlist.

80
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:53,092
- Yeah.
- Hey, Kev, how we lookin'?

81
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,758
Clear skies. Calm waters.

82
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,050
- Awesome.
- Can't lose.

83
00:04:57,842 --> 00:05:00,715
Anyway. Um. Sorry.
Dr. Greg loves his lists.

84
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,217
"Dr. Greg." Don't you mean
"Orthodontist Greg"?

85
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:04,800
Hey, by the way,

86
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:07,092
have you ever told him that you
actually worked on this boat?

87
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,675
I mean, he is your boyfriend.

88
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:11,548
- Uh... Yes. Yes. Obviously.
- Hmm.

89
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,592
- He doesn't know all the stories.
- Oh!

90
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:14,925
Because he would run scared

91
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:16,675
if he knew all the shit
I got up to with you guys.

92
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,881
- Well, then let's call him...
- No, absolutely not!

93
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:21,300
Seriously! Sailor's code, dude!

94
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:24,050
All right, let's go.

95
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,383
Cool, yeah, no, I'll just...
clean up everything, as always.

96
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:30,383
Thanks, dude!

97
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:37,967
Tonight, Sean.

98
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:39,133
I'll have you in handcuffs.

99
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:42,550
Not "soon."

100
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,381
Tonight, Sean,

101
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:47,133
and your little dog too
are going down.

102
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:48,550
You know, Sean...

103
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:50,050
What?

104
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:52,008
What? For the love of God!

105
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,550
Every time!

106
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:55,215
- Hey, buddy!
- How's it going, Walsh?

107
00:05:55,217 --> 00:05:57,381
- It's all right.
- My god.

108
00:05:57,383 --> 00:05:59,717
This is janky.
You wanted to see me?

109
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,048
I did. Lock that door,
would you?

110
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,215
There's two locks. Lock both.
One's a bolt.

111
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:05,050
The other one's in the
door handle right there itself.

112
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:08,092
Just... we wanna be
snug as a bug... in two rugs.

113
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:09,550
How long you been
on the force, Hicks?

114
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:11,467
You mean lake patrol?

115
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:12,883
Three days.

116
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:14,717
You know, most partners
only last one week with me.

117
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:17,175
- What happens to them?
- They tap out.

118
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:19,133
Choke's a choke.
HR gets involved.

119
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:21,383
It's, it's better to just
cut 'em loose than go to trial.

120
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:24,425
What brought you, uh, to LALP?

121
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,715
You love the lake?
Search for justice?

122
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:28,050
Craigslist.

123
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:30,548
Craig's a good guy.
Tell him I said hi, okay?

124
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,717
It's a website.

125
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,092
Do you live here?

126
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,092
No. Live here? No.

127
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:36,717
I got a big house. No.

128
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:39,215
There's a bed. There's, like,
drool stains on the pillow.

129
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:40,842
'Cause I was sound asleep.

130
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,715
You take a lot of all-nighters
that you gotta pull here.

131
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:44,717
A lot of surveillance work. You
could take a nap if you want.

132
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,300
You're probably tired,
out in the sun all day.

133
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:47,633
I'll lay with you
if you're frightened.

134
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:48,967
- I'm good.
- Okay.

135
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,925
Why is your pans all crusty?
You cook here?

136
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,675
Yes, I cook.
I cook quesadillas.

137
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:55,008
I cook mean quesadillas.

138
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,633
You can have a quesadilla.
I'll cook one for ya.

139
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:58,342
I'll clean the pot first.
And the pan.

140
00:06:58,383 --> 00:06:59,633
And then you probably
can sleep here.

141
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:01,342
You can lay down and take a nap.
I'll lay with you

142
00:07:01,383 --> 00:07:02,675
- in case you get frightened.
- I'm good.

143
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:04,758
Is that piss?

144
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,133
You can go if you want.
It's all right.

145
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,548
It's just two dudes.
It's all right.

146
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,048
It's totally normal.

147
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,925
- What's-what's that bucket for?
- That's composting.

148
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,215
- You don't wanna go near that...
- Ugh!

149
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:13,381
That's shit!

150
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:14,592
You take the feces
of other animals

151
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:15,715
for the benefit of a garden.

152
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:17,925
You know what? Yes!
I live here. Okay?

153
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:19,717
And I'm proud of it.
You know why I live here?

154
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:22,050
'Cause of that white boat.
And these two assholes...

155
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,300
Well, he's an asshole.
He's kinda handsome in a cool...

156
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:26,383
They think they run the lake.
But they don't run that lake.

157
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:28,175
Hicks, I run that lake.

158
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:29,715
But you wanna know
what this is right here?

159
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:32,342
This is my golden ticket
for that white boat.

160
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:33,967
This is the Lake Council
telling me

161
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:35,800
I have full authority
to bring those assholes

162
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:38,550
and burn 'em
to the ground, tonight!

163
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,883
So if you're in,
if you're down with the job,

164
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:42,300
cop a squat, take a leak,

165
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:43,800
drain the train,
have a quesadilla,

166
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:45,508
take a nap, I'll lay
with you if you want,

167
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,715
because tonight, we roll.

168
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,883
Let's go buzz their tower!

169
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:51,092
Okay.

170
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,133
Hey, wait, wait!

171
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:53,300
Slow down, white lightening!

172
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,717
Wait, Kiles, hold on!

173
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:01,548
- Hold on.
- Sad, Max.

174
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,717
Yeah, I know.

175
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:05,967
Oh!

176
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:07,842
Oh, please, come on.

177
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:10,508
It's not like Dr. Supercuts
can keep up with you either?

178
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,967
Greg ran track at Trinity.

179
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,425
Of course he did.

180
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:14,925
Dude...

181
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,925
I really need you guys to be
friends if this is gonna work.

182
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,175
I need to be friends
with that guy

183
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:19,758
like you need to adopt
more puppies.

184
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,467
Don't talk smack about my pups.

185
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:23,092
I'm ride or die
for those bitches.

186
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:27,842
You really serious
about this whole thing?

187
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:31,967
I don't know. Sometimes
it feels like I'm faking it.

188
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,050
Running a shelter.

189
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,548
I guess I wish
I could be back on the boat

190
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,758
mixing drinks with you guys.

191
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:40,758
Well... I know a guy
who can make that happen.

192
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:45,175
But I was actually talking
about you and Greg.

193
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:50,550
He is the sweetest, most
supportive guy I've ever met.

194
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:55,842
I think I found someone
really special.

195
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:57,383
Ah.

196
00:08:57,425 --> 00:08:59,508
Can you just try to be nice?

197
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,508
Please? At least for tonight?

198
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,342
Yeah.

199
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,050
Fine.

200
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,383
But... only because...

201
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,258
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. You're so gross.

202
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,800
...I love you so much.

203
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:17,381
Gross. Gross.
Gross. Gross. Gross.

204
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:18,592
- Oh, God, get off.
- Let's go.

205
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:21,842
God, you sweat
like Trump's ball sack.

206
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:23,883
Well, yeah.

207
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:25,258
All right. One more mile.

208
00:09:25,342 --> 00:09:26,883
- Okay.
- Try to keep up.

209
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:28,175
You're getting slow
in your old age.

210
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:41,008
You got this tonight, Sean.
This is a big party.

211
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,925
This is one of our biggest.
What do we got?

212
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:45,258
Smooth jazz, check.

213
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,508
Pinot Grigio, check.

214
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,675
- Officers boarding vessel.
- Mm-hmm.

215
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,550
What do you want, Walsh?

216
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,050
French vanilla? Creamer?
You're a pussy.

217
00:09:58,092 --> 00:09:59,092
Where's your partner?

218
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,715
He's running errands.

219
00:10:00,717 --> 00:10:02,217
Oh, really?

220
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:03,715
Ooh! Looks like
you guys are in line

221
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:05,008
for another shitshow tonight.

222
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,548
- That's nice.
- Actually, sorry to disappoint.

223
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,592
Tonight's a classy party,

224
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,300
hosted by
a locally respected doctor.

225
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,842
Oh, he's an orthodontist,
actually.

226
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:13,008
I don't care if it's Sean's
mom's vagina doctor.

227
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,381
Doesn't matter.

228
00:10:14,383 --> 00:10:16,008
I've been waiting
for this moment for ten years.

229
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,383
- This is my moment!
- What moment?

230
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:19,592
What moment? I just got word
from the Lake Council

231
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,092
you guys haven't paid
any of your fines.

232
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,550
You guys are in the hole, uh...

233
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:23,883
what's the number
up to now, Hicks?

234
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:25,092
I think like
eighteen grand, sir.

235
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,508
Eighteen thousand dollars.

236
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,550
First of all... don't talk
about my mom.

237
00:10:29,592 --> 00:10:31,300
- Or Dr. Nancy.
- Second,

238
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:33,467
we're gonna have the money.

239
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,215
Why do you know the name
of his mom's gynecologist?

240
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,383
You don't think that's odd?

241
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:38,633
How are you gonna get the money

242
00:10:38,717 --> 00:10:40,633
if I ding you
with citations tonight.

243
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:43,715
If you guys screw up,
and you will screw up.

244
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:46,050
- Mayday, mayday, mayday.
- Not gonna happen.

245
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:47,381
- Mayday!
- It's not gonna happen!

246
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:48,508
- Mayday.
- Hey, guys,

247
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,383
where should I put
these fireworks?

248
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:54,967
It says it's "illegal in the
contiguous United States." Huh.

249
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:56,342
Thank God we're on a lake.

250
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,383
- Also, I opened up the tramp...
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

251
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:00,008
...for...

252
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,425
Why don't you go upstairs
for a second.

253
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:03,633
I think I saw a, uh, Teletubby.

254
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:05,092
Yeah, yeah, totally.

255
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:10,092
This is going to be so easy.

256
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:15,300
Come on, Hicks, let's go.

257
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:18,133
Come on. Hicks!

258
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,758
I freaking hate that guy.

259
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,883
Seanie, why have we not been
paying our bills, man?

260
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,258
Uh, it's the fines, Max.

261
00:11:27,342 --> 00:11:29,758
The fines that your party tricks
keep sticking us with.

262
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:32,008
- Me?
- Yeah.

263
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,133
Bobbing for lobsters.
We got a fine for it.

264
00:11:35,175 --> 00:11:38,050
What about the Mermaid Olympics?
Remember that? Human catapult?

265
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,842
- That was awesome.
- No, that was awesome.

266
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:41,175
That was...
that was pretty cool.

267
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,133
Look, man, we got into
this business together

268
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:44,467
as equal partners, man,

269
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:46,425
and I'm doing everything I can
to keep us afloat

270
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:48,258
but the fines are crushing us.

271
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,717
Kiley's party is
the payday we need.

272
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:53,633
So for one night,
I need you to help me, okay?

273
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:55,133
We have to keep things low-key

274
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:56,883
and we have to keep Walsh
off this boat.

275
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,715
All right. Fine.
I got you.

276
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:01,925
Hey, first mates forever.
Two times.

277
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:03,881
Two times. Mm.
First mates forever.

278
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:05,425
All right, cool. Checklist: Gas?

279
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:07,050
Yeah. Absolutely.

280
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:10,092
Man, you run out
of gas one time...

281
00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:12,050
- It was three...
- Three times.

282
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:14,175
That's right. Uh, did you fix
the door on the lower deck?

283
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:16,467
Come on, man. This is Kiley
we're talking about.

284
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:18,217
You don't think
I want tonight to be perfect?

285
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,467
I think that I'm like this close
to getting her back on the crew.

286
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:26,175
It's been two years.
She's rescuing puppies now.

287
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:28,300
Listen, I'm gonna say this to
you as your best friend, okay?

288
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,383
You gotta let her go.

289
00:12:32,258 --> 00:12:33,675
Hey!

290
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:36,467
Pick up a bag!

291
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:42,633
We have to be prepared

292
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:44,092
for anything when
we're out there, Hicks.

293
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,215
Tonight...

294
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:49,258
Look at this horse stance.
Look at this!

295
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:51,548
Anything at all, buddy.
That's why we train.

296
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,050
That's right, buddy.
Come on, let's train.

297
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,467
Nah. Calm down.

298
00:12:57,508 --> 00:12:59,467
We're just lake patrol.
You know that.

299
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:01,715
Just lake patrol?

300
00:13:01,717 --> 00:13:03,175
Is that what you're gonna say
when you're...

301
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,592
when you're out
in the shit, tonight?

302
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:06,133
"I'm lake patrol."
You gonna take a selfie?

303
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,342
Put it in your wifi cloud?
Is that what you're gonna do?

304
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:09,717
No.

305
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:11,508
- I'll probably just tweet it.
- Suit yourself,

306
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,467
lazy. What?

307
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:14,925
No, I'm talkin'
to Hicks there, Sean.

308
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:17,217
What?

309
00:13:17,258 --> 00:13:19,258
What was that, Sean?

310
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,050
What was that? Hey, Max?
Wanna eat a dick?

311
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,215
Whoa!

312
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:23,758
Hey, Sean!

313
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,800
He's tall. Sean's taller.

314
00:13:26,883 --> 00:13:28,258
Upwards. To the Adam's apple.

315
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,425
He falls towards you? Little
shoe shine on the way down.

316
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:33,425
Hey, Sean.

317
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:35,675
Ooh! Ooh!
Elbows. Right there.

318
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:36,881
Six stitches above the eye.

319
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,633
You ever see guys
with really cool stitches?

320
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,133
It's either hockey
or they caught one of my elbows.

321
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:43,008
Right there.

322
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,342
Why won't you just train
with me?

323
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:46,425
Honestly, I mean,

324
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,092
I feel like
you're gonna lose your shit

325
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,133
and accidentally hurt me, so.

326
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:51,467
Well, who knows? Right?

327
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:52,800
I don't accidentally
lose my temper.

328
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:54,592
Pain is a valuable,
valuable lesson.

329
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,842
Maybe you could use
a lesson or two.

330
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,217
I'll get on the boat,

331
00:13:58,258 --> 00:13:59,258
I'll write some tickets...

332
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:03,050
but I don't wanna do that.

333
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,717
This is good footwork.
That's mat work, man.

334
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:07,258
Mat work's good for ya.

335
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
Just train. That's the problem

336
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:10,758
with your
entire generation, buddy.

337
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,048
Got your faces in your phones.

338
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,175
Palm strike. Palm strike.

339
00:14:15,217 --> 00:14:16,217
Box cutter!

340
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:19,467
You're not gonna learn anything
on the internet.

341
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,633
That was...

342
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:27,050
Where the hell
did you learn that?

343
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,092
The internet.

344
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:33,592
You don't even know
what that's called, do ya?

345
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:35,467
- Yelling?
- Can you stretch?

346
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,675
Let's see you stretch.

347
00:14:36,717 --> 00:14:38,342
Why don't ya go sit down
before you get hurt?

348
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:39,925
- You didn't stretch!
- A'ight.

349
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,092
Hoo!

350
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,467
The ancients believed that
every object had a soul.

351
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,383
Meet your maker!

352
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,758
Oh, that is sweet.

353
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,342
What'd I tell you
about playing with knives?

354
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:55,092
- That they're awesome?
- Didn't say that. Put it away.

355
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:56,675
Oh! But I am a fruit ninja!

356
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:00,883
You are a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

357
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,050
You better look alive tonight,

358
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,633
because Kiley's gonna be
on the boat,

359
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:05,715
and you are already on the verge
of being replaced, my friend.

360
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:06,717
Huh? What's that?

361
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,133
Ahoy, mateys!

362
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:12,008
Oh, great, the human
mouth guard has arrived.

363
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:19,550
- Keep up the good work, man.
- I shall. Always do.

364
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,592
Hey!

365
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:30,215
There they are.
The party boys.

366
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:32,300
Lookin' sharp, Greg.
I like that!

367
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:34,717
Thank you, good man. You know,
I went with the full seersuck

368
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:36,175
- since we're on a boat.
- Yeah.

369
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:39,508
- <i>♪ I'm on a boat ♪</i>
- No. No, no, no. Never.

370
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,050
Never that song.
Never on our boat.

371
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:43,508
Hey, buddy.

372
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,967
So we feel good?
Special night, right?

373
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:48,383
- Yeah.
- Yup, it is.

374
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,050
But why are you here
an hour early, Greg?

375
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:53,258
Dr. Greg is always early
for his appointments.

376
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:56,633
I just wanted to make sure
all our ducks are in a row.

377
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:58,258
Our ducks are in a row.
Aren't they, Sean?

378
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,967
- They are, Max.
- As a matter of fact, Greg...

379
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:01,425
We have bow ties
on all the crew.

380
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:03,383
We have smooth jazz
on all the speakers

381
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:04,758
and wine in every glass.

382
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,925
Trust me, Greg,
we're all over it.

383
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,133
- Bow ties?
- Uh-huh.

384
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,592
- Jazz?
- Yeah.

385
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,548
I thought Kiley wanted to have
her birthday on our boat

386
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,715
because she likes the way
that we do things,

387
00:16:13,717 --> 00:16:15,217
- Sean.
- Kiley?

388
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:17,842
Booking the boat was my idea.

389
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:19,092
You know, for nostalgia.

390
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:20,715
I just wanted to remind her
where she came from

391
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:23,050
before showing her
where we're going.

392
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:25,217
That's amazing.
Isn't that amazing?

393
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:28,217
What does that mean?

394
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,215
Between us...

395
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:31,800
I'm gonna ask her
to marry me tonight.

396
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:34,842
Whoo!

397
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,883
You know, it feels so good
being able to say that out loud.

398
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:39,133
Wow! Our first proposal.

399
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:40,258
Big time.

400
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,633
Now, I'm gonna need you
to help me out

401
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:43,217
and take extra care
of my Eomma.

402
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:47,133
Jesus, Greg. You look like
an asshole in that suit.

403
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,548
Welcome aboard, Miss Kim.

404
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,633
Uh, hope you brought
your dancing shoes.

405
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:53,258
The Kims don't dance.

406
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:56,881
Now, where's the bar?

407
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,508
It's gonna be great.

408
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:01,842
I like your mom, Greg.

409
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:16,258
Hey. Are you serious with this?

410
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,842
I am. And, uh,
can you hit that top button?

411
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:20,800
- No!
- Yeah. Please.

412
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:22,717
How you guys doing?

413
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:24,008
Oh, hey, welcome!

414
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,383
So I'm thinking,
if we wanna avoid Walsh,

415
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,133
our best bet is
to hug the shore,

416
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:31,092
anchor down in the cove.

417
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,425
Yeah, we should be
in good shape.

418
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:34,133
- You hearing me, Max?
- Were you saying something?

419
00:17:36,217 --> 00:17:37,592
Oh, hey! There she is.

420
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,717
Ready to get behind that bar,
birthday girl? Two times!

421
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,758
Unh!

422
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,425
You guys remember
my sister, Lauren.

423
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:44,925
Yeah, sorry about the divorce.
Tough break.

424
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:46,883
Hmm. Screw off, Max.

425
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:48,383
This boat better not sink.

426
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,800
That's for sure.

427
00:17:49,842 --> 00:17:52,175
'Cause I'm paying
for the return trip too.

428
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:53,883
Come on, ladies,
all aboard!

429
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:55,300
Get in there!

430
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,342
Babe,
that suit looks great.

431
00:17:57,383 --> 00:17:58,342
Hey, Max?

432
00:17:58,383 --> 00:17:59,758
Hmm?

433
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,758
No!

434
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:03,217
- Yes.
- No, no...

435
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,050
All right. You ready?
You ready to do this?

436
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,717
- Yeah. I'm good.
- No, you're not good.

437
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:17,592
Yeah, you've got a citation
book, but you're forgetting

438
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:19,383
the number one danger
out there on that lake, man.

439
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,717
What's the matter
with you? The sun!

440
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:26,425
You got... the sun, 'cause the
lake reflects all the light up.

441
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:28,092
- So what's this?
- Uh...

442
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:31,717
- weird pocket dildo?
- I wish!

443
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,508
- I don't know.
- Sunscreen, buddy.

444
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,715
You gotta get lubed up.
I can't have you burned.

445
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:37,383
Your tattoos will look like
crumbled fresco.

446
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:40,592
It'll look like some kinda weird
Jackson Pollock, you know? Here.

447
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:41,800
- So much!
- Look up. Look up.

448
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:43,800
- There you go. Now be still...
- Oh, God.

449
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:45,258
- be still, don't talk.
- What are you doing?

450
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,675
Lubin' up.

451
00:18:46,717 --> 00:18:49,467
Ooh. You... Yeah.
A lot of push-ups, I like that.

452
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:50,925
Why are you touching
my nipple like that?

453
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:52,633
I don't know, I didn't
expect it to be that long.

454
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:54,925
- Sorry. Here.
- Ah! God!

455
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,050
- What the hell?
- You gotta keep your eyes closed!

456
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,967
You're all right.
You want a nice tan line.

457
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:00,550
You got it in my eyes.

458
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:02,842
Here and I'll rub that in too.
It's okay. It's okay.

459
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,175
- Oh!
- It's okay.

460
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,550
I think I can't see anymore.

461
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,342
Let's go get those assholes.

462
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,217
Okay, let's go.

463
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,258
Look at her, man.

464
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:52,217
That is her
"I'm bored as hell

465
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:53,967
but I'm trying
to be polite" face.

466
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:56,300
Ugh, it's pathetic.

467
00:19:56,342 --> 00:19:58,175
You know, Max,
it's a great thing

468
00:19:58,217 --> 00:19:59,675
you and Kiley are just friends

469
00:19:59,717 --> 00:20:01,048
and you're totally
not in love with her.

470
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,300
Otherwise, this news
of her impending engagement

471
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:05,592
would be one hell of a punch
to the nuts, huh?

472
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:07,592
I'm not "totally"
in love with her.

473
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,675
I guess the great part
about being just her friend

474
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:12,258
and, as you specifically noted,
nothing more,

475
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,800
is that you'll get to help her
choose out a wedding dress.

476
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:16,425
And when she's stressed out
about the props

477
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:18,633
in the photo booth
and her batshit mother-in-law,

478
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,548
you'll get to be
her totally platonic,

479
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,133
non-sexual shoulder to lean on.

480
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:26,383
And once she's married,
you'll get to be her confidant.

481
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,675
When she's worried that

482
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:29,258
Greg is no longer interested
in her sexually...

483
00:20:29,342 --> 00:20:30,383
Enough!

484
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:37,548
We've just never been single
at the same time,

485
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,717
and I didn't want
to mess up our friendship.

486
00:20:41,717 --> 00:20:44,092
Besides, I've been waiting
for the perfect moment.

487
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:46,092
You've been waiting
since fourth grade, man!

488
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:47,967
Yeah, well, there's a lot
of elements that go into

489
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:50,758
the perfect moment, Jonathan.

490
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,467
Trust me,

491
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:53,675
I'm the party guy.

492
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:56,883
I know a thing or two
about "moments."

493
00:20:56,925 --> 00:20:59,217
Okay, well,
how about you make one!

494
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,550
Okay? Before Mr. Doctor Man
wifes her up?

495
00:21:03,758 --> 00:21:04,717
Yeah.

496
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:06,381
Yeah.

497
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:07,925
You know what? You're right.

498
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:09,215
But I will need your help.

499
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:10,883
Sean putting us
into the cove so you...

500
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:13,342
Oh, no can do, buddy.

501
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:15,092
Not to be selfish,
but tonight is all about me,

502
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:17,842
whoever the hell that is, and
the rest of our lives together.

503
00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:20,008
Don't even bother.
Lauren will swallow you whole.

504
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,300
That's the plan.

505
00:21:23,508 --> 00:21:25,092
Hey, my name is Jonathan,

506
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:28,008
and I'm here to help you find
your smile on this voyage.

507
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,717
Shove that smile up your dick.

508
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:31,550
My husband screwed
his life coach

509
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:33,383
and left me with two kids
and no child support,

510
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,258
so pour me a goddamned whiskey.

511
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:39,133
Charming as ever, Lauren!

512
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:42,050
One sadness on rocks!

513
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,758
- The bottle, Max.
- Okay.

514
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:51,175
Twenty bucks says I take her
to the township of pound.

515
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:54,092
Yeah.

516
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:55,715
But if I don't,
I get to keep the money.

517
00:21:55,717 --> 00:21:57,342
That's not how betting works.

518
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,883
- Oh!
- I know it.

519
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:11,258
Lauren?

520
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:18,008
Hey. You know we're not
actually gonna sink, right?

521
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,383
No, we're sinking.

522
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:20,967
We just won't know it
until it's too late.

523
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,300
Come on, it's not that bad.

524
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:27,925
Listen to me, Kiley.
You graduate college,

525
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:29,967
and everything's great.

526
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,048
You meet a guy.

527
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,548
And he's gorgeous
and boring and predictable

528
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,215
and incredibly safe.

529
00:22:38,217 --> 00:22:41,300
And no one ever went wrong
with a nice guy, right?

530
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,008
That's wrong.

531
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:47,008
Trust me,
I know you love Greg,

532
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,925
but don't rush into anything.

533
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,342
Are you ready for this?

534
00:22:53,383 --> 00:22:55,258
Are you ready?

535
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,175
This one is special.
I can tell.

536
00:22:58,217 --> 00:22:59,633
Did you see
the-the anger in her eyes?

537
00:22:59,675 --> 00:23:01,467
The hatred in her voice?

538
00:23:01,508 --> 00:23:02,675
That's so hot!

539
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:04,883
She's the one, Little J.

540
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,300
She's the one.

541
00:23:08,717 --> 00:23:10,967
We can't screw this up.

542
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,550
Okay, no false starts.
No second act slumps.

543
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,508
We need to be
on top of our game!

544
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,550
Now, I'm not gonna lie...

545
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:21,675
I'm nervous.

546
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,133
But you can't be, okay?

547
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:29,300
I need you to rise
like the sun in the east.

548
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:33,800
Looking sharp, Little J.

549
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,383
Looking sharp.

550
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:38,967
Yeah.

551
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,425
Table one, thank you.

552
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:53,758
So far so good, huh?

553
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,425
Yeah, if you like funerals
at sea.

554
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:57,425
Max, don't sta...

555
00:23:57,508 --> 00:23:59,008
Hey, what do you guys think?

556
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:00,842
Proposal at sunset
or under the stars?

557
00:24:00,883 --> 00:24:01,925
- Sunset.
- Stars.

558
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:04,842
All right. I trust you, Max.

559
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:06,633
Stars it is.

560
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:08,508
Sean, on my cue,
you play that song,

561
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,800
and I'll take care
of the rest, okay?

562
00:24:09,842 --> 00:24:11,048
Yes.

563
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,050
- I'm excited.
- Yeah!

564
00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:15,300
I'm nervous.
Should I be nervous?

565
00:24:15,342 --> 00:24:17,092
- Of course...
- Yeah, have you thought this through?

566
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:19,758
Did I think this through?

567
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,092
I've been rehearsing this
for weeks.

568
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:25,133
Look, look. Do-Don't worry
about a thing. Okay?

569
00:24:25,175 --> 00:24:26,883
Everything is set.
You're gonna do great.

570
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:31,467
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah! Come on, man!

571
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,967
Whoo!

572
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:37,008
That's an all right dude.

573
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:39,842
That guy's keeping TJ Maxx
in business.

574
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:42,548
No, don't do that, okay?
We need to get paid, Max.

575
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,508
And that only happens
if Greg walks away happy.

576
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,717
And that doesn't happen
if she's having a shitty time.

577
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,300
Look at her, man.
She's bored out of her mind!

578
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,715
Come on.

579
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:55,092
Dr. Greg can do
his thing later, okay?

580
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:57,800
Right now,
what we need...

581
00:24:58,842 --> 00:25:00,217
- is to flip this party.
- No.

582
00:25:00,258 --> 00:25:02,050
No, no. What about lake patrol?

583
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:03,425
You had the captain
put us in the cove.

584
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:05,342
You don't think we can handle
Chuckie Walsh?

585
00:25:06,342 --> 00:25:08,842
Come on. Sean?

586
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:12,300
All right, fine. Just promise
me nobody dies tonight.

587
00:25:12,383 --> 00:25:14,800
We've been doin' this
for seven years.

588
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:16,050
We haven't lost
anybody yet!

589
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,383
I'm serious, Max.

590
00:25:21,883 --> 00:25:23,092
Shoot.

591
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,175
Still nothing.

592
00:25:26,217 --> 00:25:28,215
Still nothing?
They just pulled into the cove.

593
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:29,381
That's gonna be the crime scene.

594
00:25:29,383 --> 00:25:31,050
You just gotta be
patient, Hicks!

595
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:33,175
Why are you always
on their case, man?

596
00:25:33,217 --> 00:25:35,217
Because they're the reason
I'm standing here on a dinghy

597
00:25:35,258 --> 00:25:37,383
with a dinghy that looks
like Sammy Hagar's son

598
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:40,383
instead of out there throwing
detective cock all over town.

599
00:25:40,425 --> 00:25:42,258
Ugh!

600
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,800
2007, that's when it
all changed, my man.

601
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:46,758
2007... I don't want these.

602
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,508
I used to break up
their high school parties.

603
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,633
That was me.
I was the big bad wolf.

604
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,048
"Here comes Officer Walsh,

605
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,383
everybody put
your cups down and run!"

606
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:55,715
You should have seen
the looks on their dumb faces

607
00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:58,300
when I came through the woods
with my big spotlight.

608
00:25:58,383 --> 00:26:00,925
Then I had to stop, I didn't
feel like doin' that job anymore

609
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:02,758
and it was a misunderstanding.
It's, uh, it's stupid.

610
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:05,258
- Wait, I remember that night.
- No. That's impossible.

611
00:26:05,342 --> 00:26:06,592
You're the guy
with the big spotlight.

612
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:08,300
First of all,
let's keep our voices down.

613
00:26:08,342 --> 00:26:09,881
Because water,
sound travels differently

614
00:26:09,883 --> 00:26:11,508
than it does, not water.

615
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,883
Sean told me a young man
needed counseling.

616
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:16,050
So I pulled him aside
to counsel him, okay?

617
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,717
Okay, but why was
your pants down?

618
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:21,925
We were in a restroom.

619
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:25,508
Makes perfect sense.

620
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,508
Makes perfect sense to me.
And a judge. A state judge.

621
00:26:30,842 --> 00:26:32,050
Give me these. You know what?

622
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,548
Watch this.

623
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,633
Look what I'm doing
with my eyes. Watch this.

624
00:26:36,717 --> 00:26:38,133
You see that?
You're not even looking at me.

625
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:39,800
Look what I'm doing with my eyes.
Can you do this?

626
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:42,050
I can see just as far
as those are.

627
00:26:48,217 --> 00:26:50,342
Hello, attention everyone,
up here.

628
00:26:50,383 --> 00:26:52,383
Hello, hi.

629
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:54,175
My name is Max.

630
00:26:54,217 --> 00:26:56,048
I'm co-owner of this ship,

631
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,215
but I also happen to be
an old friend of Kiley's.

632
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,133
Now, as some of you know,

633
00:27:00,175 --> 00:27:03,967
Kiley was a founding staff
member of the S.S. Party Boat.

634
00:27:04,008 --> 00:27:07,217
And that first summer,
our original idea was

635
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,800
to just park her at the dock,

636
00:27:09,842 --> 00:27:11,133
use her as a floating bar.

637
00:27:12,217 --> 00:27:14,675
But it was Kiley

638
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,800
who stood up and told us,

639
00:27:16,883 --> 00:27:19,215
something that has moved this
business forward ever since.

640
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:23,050
She said, "A ship is safe
in the harbor,

641
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:25,092
but that's not
what ships were built for."

642
00:27:27,717 --> 00:27:29,258
Quickly we found out that
she got that

643
00:27:29,342 --> 00:27:30,717
off of a mug
at the marina giftshop.

644
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,383
Wrap it up!

645
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:39,215
But that is precisely why
we love Kiley so much.

646
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:42,342
Because she knows
that pursuing adventure

647
00:27:42,383 --> 00:27:45,508
is much more rewarding than just
sitting safely in some harbor.

648
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,008
And she also happens to be

649
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,967
the best damn bartender
in all of Lake Everett.

650
00:27:50,008 --> 00:27:51,717
So watch your back, Jonathan!

651
00:27:52,883 --> 00:27:54,050
<i>So raise a glass.</i>

652
00:27:57,883 --> 00:27:58,883
To Kiley.

653
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:00,092
To Kiley.

654
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,258
Now, there is one more thing

655
00:28:10,717 --> 00:28:14,048
that Kiley Abigail Miller
will not stand for.

656
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,717
And that is
a boring party, okay?

657
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,508
It's time to go off
the script a bit.

658
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,967
Off script?

659
00:28:21,008 --> 00:28:23,675
So put down your cellphones,
toss your inhibitions,

660
00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:25,008

I knew it. I knew it.
I hate them.

684
00:29:51,883 --> 00:29:54,758
I'm so jealous of the fun
that they have.

685
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:58,675
You know what you do when you're
a real cop in a real town?

686
00:29:58,717 --> 00:30:00,425
You arrest people,
you put them in handcuffs.

687
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,217
Now look at me.

688
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,592
There's fish underneath us
right now.

689
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:07,050
Fuckin' fish.
I go to work with fish.

690
00:30:08,383 --> 00:30:09,383
Hey, what do you bench anyway?

691
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:10,842
Are you a rep guy
or a max guy?

692
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,425
Out of my way!

693
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:18,550
What the hell?

694
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:22,550
Ken Doll-looking motherfucker.

695
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:30,300
Ma'am? Sorry,
I just wanted to make sure

696
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:31,383
you didn't need anything.

697
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:32,967
It can get kind
of unsteady out there.

698
00:30:33,008 --> 00:30:34,592
What I need is fresh air.

699
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,592
It's rather pungent upstairs.

700
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:39,467
Like sweat mixed
with... failure.

701
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:43,467
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to enjoy the view.

702
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,383
Max! Eomma overboard!

703
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:49,800
Eomma is overboard!

704
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:56,342
- Oh, wow!
- Oh!

705
00:30:56,383 --> 00:30:58,425
When do we get to see
your boyfriend's rage face?

706
00:30:58,508 --> 00:30:59,675
Does he even have one?

707
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:02,048
Greg's not much of a dancer.

708
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,383
Well, I'm sure he has
plenty of other fun,

709
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:07,215
youthful, carefree qualities.

710
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:10,592
Save me, you mofos!

711
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:12,467
Don't worry, I got you!

712
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:14,717
Wait! No! Don't touch me!

713
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:15,800
What?

714
00:31:15,842 --> 00:31:18,592
Black people can't swim!

715
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:20,258
Oh! Oh, damn!

716
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:34,925
We had fun though, didn't we?

717
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:37,425
Always.

718
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:39,717
Um...

719
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:41,258
Is everything okay?
Are you sick?

720
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:43,883
Uh...

721
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:48,715
Kiley... ever since
we were kids,

722
00:31:48,717 --> 00:31:49,883
I've always wanted
to tell you...

723
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:52,008
Oh, my God, Max.
Eomma's in the water.

724
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,133
- What?
- Loo...

725
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:54,300
Okay, okay, okay.

726
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:55,675
Just let me say
what I was about to say...

727
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:57,175
No, go! In the water!

728
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,508
Max, go!
Give me the jacket! Just...

729
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:04,217
Max! Max!

730
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:07,717
Calm down.
I'm trying to help!

731
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,258
Hey! I was finally
alone with Kiley.

732
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,717
It was the perfect moment!

733
00:32:15,758 --> 00:32:17,548
What's the matter? You forget
how to save old ladies?

734
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,215
- She's racist!
- She's not racist.

735
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:21,592
She's Asian, man!
Asians can't be racist.

736
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:23,175
She's just old.

737
00:32:23,217 --> 00:32:24,842
White devil!

738
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:26,800
- White devil?
- White devil!

739
00:32:26,842 --> 00:32:28,633
She is racist.

740
00:32:28,675 --> 00:32:30,383
What the hell is going on
down there?

741
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:33,008
Um, Greg's Eomma
fell overboard.

742
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,383
Max went in to save her,

743
00:32:34,425 --> 00:32:36,925
but I don't know why there's
so much splashing.

744
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:39,342
Because she's drowning.
Lucky bitch.

745
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:44,675
Don't worry, ladies!
I got this under control!

746
00:32:44,717 --> 00:32:46,008
BRB.

747
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:53,258
Is that guy slow or something?

748
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,881
Uh, no. He just lives
on Planet Jonathan.

749
00:32:56,883 --> 00:32:58,217
It took me six weeks
to train him.

750
00:32:59,258 --> 00:33:01,217
Oh! Not that asshole too!

751
00:33:01,258 --> 00:33:03,383
Help! I'm a very poor swimmer!

752
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:05,215
What are you doing out here
if you can't swim?

753
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,008
I was trying to impress
Kiley's sister!

754
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,508
What?

755
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,675
Help!

756
00:33:09,717 --> 00:33:11,633
I'll save her.
You help this idiot.

757
00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:13,550
- Max! Don't let me die!
- I got you.

758
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:16,175
Max! Don't let me die!

759
00:33:16,217 --> 00:33:19,800
I got you, just stop
poking me with your keys.

760
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,050
What keys?

761
00:33:25,508 --> 00:33:27,258
Oh, my God!

762
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:30,008
Nobody panic.

763
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,050
I'm a highly trained
aquatic professional.

764
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:36,883
I am not gonna let you die!

765
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:44,215
I am not gonna let you die!

766
00:33:44,217 --> 00:33:45,215
- Oh!
- Oh!

767
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,550
Oh, my God!
He's got a boner!

768
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:57,508
Dude, I was already hard
when I started kissing her.

769
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,383
- Kissing her?
- What the hell's going on down here?

770
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:01,217
Eomma, are you okay?

771
00:34:01,258 --> 00:34:04,342
Oh, my God!
This shit is going viral!

772
00:34:09,092 --> 00:34:10,717
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

773
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,217
You sure you're okay, Eomma?

774
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:21,215
I'm fine. Stop fussing over me.

775
00:34:21,217 --> 00:34:22,842
Do you still have the ring?

776
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:29,550
You gotta be careful with this.
I don't trust the black guy.

777
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:33,967
Now, someone get me
some aspirin.

778
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:36,842
My head is throbbing
like that bartender's cock.

779
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:40,133
Hurry! Oh, jeez.

780
00:34:42,175 --> 00:34:43,425
Here you go.

781
00:34:47,883 --> 00:34:49,883
Uh... It's... Okay.

782
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:52,092
You know what? Here.
Take two.

783
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,133
Ooh.

784
00:34:59,217 --> 00:35:01,133
Dude, what were you thinking?

785
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:02,381
Full mast?

786
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:03,508
So soon?

787
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:07,008
We don't want to scare Lauren,

788
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,925
we wanna... woo her, all right?

789
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:12,550
Don't get me wrong...

790
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,633
it was impressive the way
you handled that cold water.

791
00:35:17,842 --> 00:35:19,550
You didn't back down
for a second.

792
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,133
Look, I know
how you can get, right?

793
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:25,633
You wanna...
you wanna rush in there,

794
00:35:25,675 --> 00:35:27,758
you wanna save the day,
we all do, be the hero.

795
00:35:30,425 --> 00:35:33,925
I need you to be patient...
and trust me. Okay?

796
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,092
That's all I need.

797
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:38,717
I need you
to stand down, soldier.

798
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,342
That a boy.
That... a... boy.

799
00:35:50,342 --> 00:35:51,925
Bro, you told me
you fixed the railing!

800
00:35:52,008 --> 00:35:54,508
I did! Which railing
were you talking about?

801
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,300
Dude, this shit is awesome!

802
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:57,715
You delete that video!

803
00:35:57,717 --> 00:35:58,967
Freedom of the press, dude!

804
00:35:59,008 --> 00:36:00,133
Yeah, don't censor her.

805
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:02,300
I can't believe I trusted you.

806
00:36:02,342 --> 00:36:03,717
A woman almost died.

807
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:06,050
And you're uploading
the evidence to Instagram?

808
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:09,217
Come on, Sean.

809
00:36:09,258 --> 00:36:11,092
Chuckie Walsh has never even
heard of Instagram.

810
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:17,092
These guys are dumber
than we thought.

811
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,425
Yeah. Only three hashtags?

812
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:20,550
What losers.

813
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:23,048
Total losers. What's a hashtag?

814
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,592
- It's...
- I'm talking about the old lady

815
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:26,383
almost dying.

816
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:27,425
Oh.

817
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:31,008
Why don't we just go in?

818
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,008
We can't go in, because
the old lady has to be dead.

819
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,342
Unfortunately,
she didn't die.

820
00:36:35,383 --> 00:36:36,717
Right.

821
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:40,633
You're kidding, right?

822
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:43,967
Is that a home perm?

823
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:45,925
I want to get one, but I
don't think I have enough hair.

824
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:48,883
All right, that's it.

825
00:36:48,925 --> 00:36:51,092
I'm getting this party back
under control. Give it up.

826
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:52,300
Give what up?

827
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:54,383
- Max.
- Sean.

828
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:55,425
Max.

829
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,092
Sean.

830
00:37:09,342 --> 00:37:12,715
From now on, we're sticking
to the script.

831
00:37:22,383 --> 00:37:24,133
It's time to call in
the big guns.

832
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:27,217
What are these guys
gonna do next?

833
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:28,883
Look at this!
Nobody's wearing a life-vest.

834
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:30,092
That's just safety!

835
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:40,592
Who among ye
be ready to die?

836
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,715
'Cause as of this moment...

837
00:37:44,425 --> 00:37:47,758
...we pirates be taking over
this boat.

838
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,217
And we be taking you
to... Fun Town!

839
00:37:53,258 --> 00:37:55,215
- Ha ha ha! Arrr!
- Yes! There they are!

840
00:37:55,217 --> 00:37:56,342
Hey, guys!

841
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:00,508
Max! Water war?

842
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,342
Water war!

843
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,050
Two teams there be:

844
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,967
Red the color of blood

845
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:09,217
and blue the color
of the sea.

846
00:38:09,258 --> 00:38:11,592
The rules are simple.

847
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:14,508
Only head shots count.

848
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,925
Three headshots, and ye be out!

849
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:21,258
Where ye
is shot, there ye shall fall.

850
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,258
Last one standing be the winner!

851
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,467
Are ye ready?

852
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,050
Are ye set!

853
00:38:30,717 --> 00:38:31,715
Go!

854
00:38:31,717 --> 00:38:33,048
Ha ha!

855
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:36,050
Fly, Carmichael, fly!

856
00:38:45,842 --> 00:38:47,633
You go right,
and I go left.

857
00:38:47,675 --> 00:38:49,092
I feel like he's right
in front of us.

858
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,383
I know, I just wanted
to feel cool.

859
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:54,342
You know, like an assassin.

860
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:56,467
Aww, you're my little assassin.

861
00:39:28,717 --> 00:39:30,967
You guys are
on the same team!

862
00:41:35,883 --> 00:41:37,092
Why?

863
00:41:37,133 --> 00:41:39,633
Why, Little J?
Why was she immune

864
00:41:39,675 --> 00:41:41,300
to all of our fire power?

865
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:42,925
Both barrels, both guns?

866
00:41:44,425 --> 00:41:46,633
The plot thickens, doesn't it?

867
00:41:46,675 --> 00:41:49,300
Hmmm, Lauren and I are going
to have beautiful babies.

868
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,967
So beautiful. Ooh!
It kicked!

869

Sorry, Max.
But it's my party.

Just, uh, wait...
Just one second.

that was their song?

Oh, my goodness,

How'd you know that was Greg
and I's karaoke song?

907
00:44:50,425 --> 00:44:52,842
I didn't! I-I thought
it was our song!

908
00:44:52,883 --> 00:44:54,217
You remember
the eighth grade trip to D.C.

909
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,715
We wore that song out!

910
00:44:55,717 --> 00:44:57,342

- I like it. Keep it up.
- Sure.

919
00:45:15,258 --> 00:45:16,883
There's no sign of lake patrol.
You keep it up.

920
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:18,425

I mean, holy shit,
her drinks are awesome.

923
00:45:29,008 --> 00:45:30,758
She is the Nicki Minaj

924
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:32,217
Nickelback is misunderstood!

925
00:45:34,383 --> 00:45:36,508
And I could mix circles around Kiley.

926
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,883
I don't know about circles.

00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:17,958
I-I'm sorry.

1045
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,790
Never trust an orthodontist!

1046
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:21,667
Jonathan takes round two.

1047
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:25,958
And now, for the final
and most important round.

1048
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,458
Bartender's choice.

1049
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,333
You have one minute...

1050
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:33,958
to prepare...

1051
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,583
any drink you want.

1052
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,623
And the clock... starts now.

1053
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:43,417
<i>It all comes down
to this, party people!</i>

1054
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:45,583
The master versus the moron!

1055
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:47,500
Will Kiley keep her title?

1056
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:50,792
Will Jonathan remember
to keep his shorts on?

1057
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:52,208
It's anybody's game!

1058
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:55,958
Oh, oh, he's walking away!
He's walking away!

1059
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Oh! He's comin back!
Here he comes!

1060
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:01,208
Oh, he's got nothing on her!

1061
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:03,542
Three, two, one!

1062
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:06,042
Hands up. Drinks down.

1063
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:07,333
All right.

1064
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:10,623
This, I call
a "Quarter-Life Crisis."

1065
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:12,958
Something we all know
a thing or two about.

1066
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:18,125
Oh, shit. That's good, girl.

1067
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,456
Uh-huh, whatever.

1068
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:22,917
Who needs good
when you have...

1069
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,042
the "Dwayne Johnson."

1070
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:28,000
Strong as hell, but everybody
thinks it's over-rated.

1071
00:52:28,042 --> 00:52:29,167
But they're wrong.

1072
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,417
<i>Survey says...</i>

1073
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:39,542
Oh, yes, there you went!

1074
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:42,042
Ba-ba-ba-ba. Ba-ba-ba-ba.

1075
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:45,375
That means that
the winner and still

1076
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:49,167
reigning champion
of the Lake Everett

1077
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:53,500
party boat bartender
extravaganza is...

1078
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:58,083
The Kileynator! Yeah!

1079
00:52:58,125 --> 00:53:00,375
Are you kidding me? Max!

1080
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:02,625
- Yes! Yes!
- <i>Whoo!</i>

1081
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:05,123
- Whoo!
- Wow!

1082
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:08,125
- Dude, that was so much fun.
- Mm.

1083
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:11,083
So... what do I win?

1084
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:14,083
Oh. Well, I do have
one more surprise for you.

1085
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:15,667
- Follow me.
- Of course you do.

1086
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:19,042
I'll be right back, babe.

1087
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,167
Let's go.

1088
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:21,542
That was amazing. Whoo!

1089
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:23,500
That was good.

1090
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:26,333
She's still got it.

1091
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:30,000
I think I need to move
this proposal up.

1092
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,958
- Sure thing. When?
- To now.

1093
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:37,167
- Okay, uh, I just need to cue up a few...
- No, no, no, sorry.

1094
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,583
Let me put this another way.

1095
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,083
If you don't get Max
under control

1096
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:42,208
and you don't pull this proposal
off without a hitch,

1097
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,958
I'm not paying for any of this.
You understand?

1098
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:48,667
Yeah.

1099
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:51,083
- This way, right this way.
- What are...

1100
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:53,875
My birthday surprise is a trip
to the storage room?

1101
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:56,083
Not exactly, I gotta find it.
Just, uh...

1102
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,125
Oh, my God,

1103
00:53:58,167 --> 00:53:59,665
you still have this old thing?

1104
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:02,292
Oh, yeah.
I love this hoodie!

1105
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:04,167
Whatever happened
to my red hoodie?

1106
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:07,667
Currently, it is being worn by
a mechanical large-mouthed bass

1107
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,167
- at the bottom of the lake.
- Oh.

1108
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:11,792
Now I'm jealous
of a cozy, singing fish.

1109
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,583
- Spotlight good?
- Sean,

1110
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:15,917
I can't find Kiley anywhere.

1111
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:17,625
Hey, everything is all good.
I got it set.

1112
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:19,500
- We're ready to go...
- No. I need to find her now.

1113
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:21,125
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1114
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:24,417
Whoa!

1115
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:25,750
Do you remember this?

1116
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:28,375
Diver Dan.

1117
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:29,917
Came out of retirement
at his own party

1118
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,917
to jump in the lake
and save that entire family.

1119
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:33,667
- Oh, what a legend.
- Yeah.

1120
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:42,417
Hey.

1121
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:44,583
The nurses!
The spring fling, right?

1122
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:45,667
Yeah! By the end
of the night,

1123
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:47,125
they were giving
each other IV drips.

1124
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:49,542
That's not all they were giving each other.

1125
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,708
Ah-hah! I found it!

1126
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:53,458
What?

1127
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,458
This.

1128
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,458
What is this?

1129
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:01,290
This is the flower
that I gave you

1130
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:04,123
the night of your last party
ever on the boat.

1131
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:05,956
Senior's last dance!

1132
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:08,583
- Yes! Yeah.
- I remember you gave it to me at the bar!

1133
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,125
Yeah.

1134
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:11,458
Why do you still have this?

1135
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:13,458
Just needed a memento.

1136
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,875
Of a high school
graduation party?

1137
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:19,500
Of the night... that I knew...

1138
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:21,500
That you knew what?

1139
00:55:21,542 --> 00:55:23,750
That I knew that...

1140
00:55:23,792 --> 00:55:25,958
There you are.
I've been looking for you!

1141
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,292
Uh, Max was helping me find
my bartending prize.

1142
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:31,958
Yep! And we're still looking
for it so...

1143
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,292
Could you come back
to the deck, baby?

1144
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,790
There's something
I wanna show you.

1145
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:37,167
- More surprises!
- Well...

1146
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,917
it's a surprise in that
it's something

1147
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:41,167
I've meticulously planned
for months,

1148
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,750
preparing for every contingency,

1149
00:55:42,792 --> 00:55:44,956
leaving no room
for unplanned results.

1150
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:47,208
- So, yeah! Sure!
- Cool.

1151
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:56,583
- Get out of my way.
- I can't have you messing up the program.

1152
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:58,417
And I can't have Kiley marrying
that jackass.

1153
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,875
I know you love her.

1154
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:01,917
I know you've loved her
since forever,

1155
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,708
but stopping him from what
he's about to do right now

1156
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,833
is not the right move, man.

1157
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,208
Oh, what.

1158
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:07,625
It's all about money,
I'm assuming, huh?

1159
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:09,208
Oh, you mean that thing
we have none of

1160
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,708
because every time
we leave the marina,

1161
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:11,875
you find a way
to get us fined.

1162
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,958
Money is your thing!

1163
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,333
So you deal with it.

1164
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:22,083
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1165
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:24,333
Sean! Come on!
What are you doing?

1166
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:25,500
I'm dealing with it!

1167
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,125
First mates forever?

1168
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:35,583
I'm sorry.

1169
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:39,542
I screwed everything up.
I thought my,

1170
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:41,792
my bartending prowess
could get the job done.

1171
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,917
I needed your energy up there.

1172
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,417
Your spark.

1173
00:56:50,042 --> 00:56:51,542
Okay,

1174
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:53,790
let's keep it
together, man, okay?

1175
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:56,456
If we dig deep
and work as a team,

1176
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:58,708
we can find a way
to get Lauren's heart racing.

1177
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:02,958
I have an idea.

1178
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,125
Follow me.

1179
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:11,417
Tough loss.

1180
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:13,458
Mmm, I threw it on purpose.

1181
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:16,292
Made a bet with Max
that I'd win.

1182
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:20,875
Mm.

1183
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:23,583
Come on.
I want to show you something.

1184
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,083
Okay.

1185
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,750
In Korea, this is called
<i>jug-eum-ui chum...</i>

1186
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,956
the Dance of Death.

1187
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:36,958
Throughout his entire life,
my father was undefeated

1188
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,458
and tonight,
I will continue his legacy.

1189
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:46,417
Aaaaaah!

1190
00:57:47,917 --> 00:57:49,125
Now you.

1191
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:53,623
Stupid slow finger.

1192
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:56,250
Man, this is the bullshit
I'm talking about.

1193
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:05,375
♪ A tisket a tasket
a green and yellow basket ♪

1194
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:06,958
Pathetic!

1195
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,833
Father, guide my hand.

1196
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,125
- Who is the victor?
- Eomma!

1197
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:26,458
- Who is the victor?
- Eomma!

1198
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,750
- Who is the victor?
- Eomma!

1199
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:31,292
- Oh!
- Oh!

1200
00:58:32,292 --> 00:58:33,456
Oh!

1201
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:35,456
Eternal shame!

1202
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:40,500
<i>Can I get everybody up
on the main deck please.</i>

1203
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:47,792
- You're going through some heavy stuff right now, aren't you?
- Yes.

1204
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:50,708
- Divorce. Heartbreak. Self-loathing.
- Yes.

1205
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:53,333
- Mmm. Colors are muted, food has no taste.
- Yes!

1206
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:54,875
What do you need, Lauren?

1207
00:58:54,917 --> 00:58:55,958
I need...

1208
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,333
What do you need?

1209
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:59,125
I need...

1210
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:03,875
- that Dwayne Johnson.
- Hmm.

1211
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:06,417
Testing. Testing.
Testing, one, two, three.

1212
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,083
K-I-L-E-Y.

1213
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:11,750
L-O-V-E.

1214
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:14,458
Y-O-U.

1215
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,417
Lights!

1216
00:59:22,917 --> 00:59:25,458
Good evening, everybody.

1217
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,458
I'm up here because I have
something very important to say.

1218
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,458
So here goes.

1219
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:34,208
Oh! Ah!

1220
00:59:36,875 --> 00:59:38,790
Okay, okay.

1221
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:40,000
Kiley...

1222
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:44,500
you are the center
of my universe.

1223
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:46,708
You're the light...

1224
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,792
that illuminates my life.

1225
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:56,792
Well, it's a good thing
I am one negligent bastard.

1226
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:09,625
Oh, yeah.

1227
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:17,750
What the hell is he doing?

1228
01:00:17,792 --> 01:00:19,792
I remember the first day
that we met.

1229
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,958
I saw you from across the room.

1230
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,625
You threw your head back,
and you started to laugh.

1231
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:31,290
It was the most beautiful smile
I've ever seen.

1232
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:33,625
- Aww.
- Aww.

1233
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:35,250
I knew from that instant
that my life

1234
01:00:35,292 --> 01:00:36,583
would never be the same.

1235
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:40,208
But here's the thing:

1236
01:00:41,292 --> 01:00:42,458
If you all know Kiley,

1237
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:43,917
you know what
her favorite show is, right?

1238
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:45,123
<i>So You Think You Can Dance!</i>

1239
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:46,542
So You Think You Can Dance!

1240
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:50,042
- Okay. All right.
- Come on! Come on.

1241
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:51,500
She never misses an episode,

1242
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,167
which means,

1243
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:56,458
for better or worse,
I never miss an episode.

1244
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:01,250
So a few months back...

1245
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:03,792
I was thinking how can I make
tonight extra special.

1246
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:06,623
- <i>And so...</i>
- No.

1247
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,375
- <i>Yes!</i>
- No. Really?

1248
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,792
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Okay. Okay.

1249
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:14,583
Come on up here, guys!

1250
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:15,623
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1251
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:18,083
Oh, God!

You won't remember a thing.

1282
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:40,167
Okay, now...

1283
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:41,208
now for the main event.

1284
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,667
No...

1285
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:45,708
Eomma! Eomma, could you
join us on the dance floor?

1286
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,083
Greg, You need to go
to a hospital.

1287
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:51,667
What I need... is Eomma
to be on the mark!

1288
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:52,833
Screw it.

1289
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,625
I'm fine. Aah! Oh!

1290
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:02,292
Kiley... Abigail Miller...

1291
01:04:03,917 --> 01:04:04,958
will you marry me?

1292
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:07,208
Please?

1293
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:09,250
Will you marry me?

1294
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:15,208
I...

1295
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:17,708
I'm sorry.

1296
01:04:21,417 --> 01:04:22,750
I'm sorry.

1297
01:04:40,792 --> 01:04:43,125
Hey! Oh, you okay?

1298
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:45,125
- What the hell was that?
- W-W...

1299
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:47,083
You just threw a buoy
at my boyfriend!

1300
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:49,790
First of all, it's not called
a buoy, it's called a fender.

1301
01:04:49,792 --> 01:04:53,375
But what the hell
was that though? Right?

1302
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:54,917
I just thought
it was a birthday dance.

1303
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:57,000
I had no idea
he was gonna propose.

1304
01:04:57,042 --> 01:04:59,125
Well, it's okay.
You did the right thing.

1305
01:04:59,167 --> 01:05:01,208
I just need time... to think.

1306
01:05:03,542 --> 01:05:05,625
It's weird being back
on this boat with you and Sean.

1307
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:08,500
Good weird though... right?

1308
01:05:08,542 --> 01:05:09,583
I don't know.

1309
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:12,500
I guess. Yeah.

1310
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:19,875
So... my whole life I've had
this idea of the perfect moment.

1311
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:24,417
But now, I think that maybe,

1312
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,667
you know, sometimes you just
got to take a leap of faith.

1313
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,625
- So...
- So I should marry Greg?

1314
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,583
No, I mean that I need
to take a leap of faith.

1315
01:05:32,417 --> 01:05:33,583
Because I love you.

1316
01:05:35,792 --> 01:05:37,667
Yeah, I love you too.

1317
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:42,250
No, I mean...
I'm in love with you.

1318
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:47,458
Shit!

1319
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,000
I know.

1320
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:54,042
You know,
you could not have picked

1321
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:55,875
a shittier time
to dump this on me.

1322
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:57,790
Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey,
come on.

1323
01:05:57,792 --> 01:06:00,290
It could be you and me.
Like it always was.

1324
01:06:00,292 --> 01:06:03,000
Just having fun.
Living in the moment,

1325
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:05,290
partying on the boat
all the time.

1326
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:08,250
It's just that now,
there would be...

1327
01:06:08,292 --> 01:06:09,750
a little kissing thrown in.

1328
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,042
Come on, Max.

1329
01:06:17,292 --> 01:06:18,542
That was...

1330
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:22,583
Yeah! It really was.

1331
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,792
I only hit my head
like a thousand times.

1332
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:26,208
I only pulled my groin twice!

1333
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:32,917
You wanna know something?

1334
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:34,125
What?

1335
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:38,208
I knew from the second
I saw you

1336
01:06:38,292 --> 01:06:42,167
that we had the most...
amazing connection.

1337
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,458
- Shut up.
- No, I'm serious.

1338
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,500
You wanna know
how serious I am?

1339
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:50,125
When I saw Max,

1340
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:53,292
I bet him twenty bucks
we'd get together.

1341
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:56,583
- What?
- Yeah.

1342
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:59,250
Which is something we do,
uh, but normally, I don't win,

1343
01:06:59,292 --> 01:07:01,458
or I do win,
but I can never provide proof.

1344
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,125
I can't believe this.

1345
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:06,917
No, no, no. I-I'm saying
I-I normally lose the bet,

1346
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:08,208
b-but I saw my soulmate

1347
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,792
and when you have a soulmate,
you can't lose!

1348
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:12,083
I'm making this worse, aren't I?

1349
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:13,375
Actually...

1350
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:17,333
no.

1351
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,458
I've never been
the subject of a sex bet.

1352
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:23,958
It feels awesome.

1353
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,623
I don't want you to worry
about a thing, Greg.

1354
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:35,750
I'm gonna get us back
to the marina. Okay?

1355
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:37,625
What's the point?

1356
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:39,042
Just throw me overboard.

1357
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:41,542
- Hey, Sean...
- No... I need you to take this

1358
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:43,500
and, uh, get some ice
for Dr. Kim's leg. Okay?

1359
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:44,792
- But, Sean...
- Why aren't we moving?

1360
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,125
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

1361
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:47,792
I think we ran out of gas.

1362
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:49,583
- What?
- Did he just say we're out...

1363
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:51,083
Go get the ice.

1364
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:53,167
Um, look, you relax this leg.

1365
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:55,500
Excuse me for one second.
I'll be right back.

1366
01:07:55,542 --> 01:07:56,792
Are we stranded?

1367
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,667
Eomma? Are you okay?

1368
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:17,792
I-I lost the Dance of Death

1369
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:22,792
and was defeated in battle
by a pasty manchild.

1370
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:26,250
My father is looking down
on me with shame.

1371
01:08:26,292 --> 01:08:29,792
Hey, you can't let
his approval run your life.

1372
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,167
Look...

1373
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:35,167
Eight years ago...

1374
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:38,083
I told my father
that I like women,

1375
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:41,292
and he totally freaked out.

1376
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:44,125
And then fortunately, I haven't
spoken to him since.

1377
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:47,542
But that's on him and not me.

1378
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:49,583
Understand?

1379
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:52,750
I think I do.

1380
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:53,833
Thank you.

1381
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:57,623
You're welcome.

1382
01:08:57,625 --> 01:08:59,417
Can I help you...

1383
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:00,625
get out of this?

1384
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:09,458
Hey! There you are!

1385
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,292
Guess what?
I finally told... Whoa!

1386
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:13,167
- Hey! What is...
- Come on.

1387
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:14,667
Hey, What's up?

1388
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:15,917
You said you filled the gas!

1389
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:18,167
Ha! I say a lot of things.

1390
01:09:18,208 --> 01:09:19,667
We're stranded out here.

1391
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:22,292
And if I call lake patrol,
we're totally screwed.

1392
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:24,000
Lake patrol, really?

1393
01:09:24,042 --> 01:09:25,208
You're still afraid
of those guys?

1394
01:09:25,292 --> 01:09:26,833
You've been letting Walsh
push you around

1395
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,956
- ever since high school.
- They're not pushing me around, Max!

1396
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:30,792
They're trying to kick us
off this lake!

1397
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,417
That's our business.
The one that you have again

1398
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:34,792
put yourself ahead of.

1399
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,458
You've compromised everything
we ever worked for.

1400
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,750
- We can find more money.
- No, we can't! There's no more money!

1401
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:40,708
- Have I ever let you down before?
- Yes!

1402
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:41,917
Fair enough!

1403
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:46,208
There is no way that Greg
is gonna pay for this party

1404
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,625
after you just ruined
his proposal.

1405
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:51,875
You know what?

1406
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:54,875
We're done.

1407
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:58,417
What, you don't want
to be partners anymore?

1408
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:01,625
I don't know if I even want
to be your friend.

1409
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:12,042
Oh!

1410
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,167
You hear that?

1411
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:21,292
Wait, what the hell is that.

1412
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:24,458
Is Greg about to jump?

1413
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:31,042
Greg, what the hell
are you doing?

1414
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:32,917
Leave me alone, Max!

1415
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:35,750
And there it is.
Someone's finally going to die.

1416
01:10:35,792 --> 01:10:37,667
Just... go get Kiley.

1417
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:46,292
Greg?

1418
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:50,623
Why don't you just come back
to the party, man?

1419
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:54,000
You know? Show us some more
of those cool dance moves.

1420
01:10:55,792 --> 01:10:57,292
I think I broke my ankle.

1421
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,458
Yeah, um...

1422
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:04,123
Listen, man, about that.
I'm really sorry. Okay?

1423
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:07,208
I just... I got really...
carried away.

1424
01:11:09,292 --> 01:11:10,625
Yeah, so did I.

1425
01:11:12,417 --> 01:11:13,958
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1426
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,542
Well, you were thinking about
sweeping her off her feet, man.

1427
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:21,167
It's a poor choice of words.
I'm sorry. I...

1428
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:22,542
Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait!

1429
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:25,292
Hey. Uh. Yeah.
Quick question.

1430
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:26,708
Why aren't we movin'?

1431
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,542
I was actually just reading
some of your Yelp reviews,

1432
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:29,875
and apparently
you guys are pretty...

1433
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:31,625
- Kiley?
- ...well known for running out of gas.

1434
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:33,542
Kiley? Kiley?

1435
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:35,500
Yeah. Okay. Good talk.

1436
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:36,792
- Whats up?
- Greg's up front,

1437
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:38,250
- says he's gonna jump.
- Shit!

1438
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:39,458
Greg doesn't know how to swim.

1439
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:42,000
I'm telling everyone

1440
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:44,125
you guys are irresponsible
and incompetent.

1441
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:45,625
Yeah, why haven't you called
for help?

1442
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:49,958
Fine, you know what?
What's the point.

1443
01:11:50,042 --> 01:11:51,875
Everyone hold tight
while I call lake patrol.

1444
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:58,083
Greg. Greg, what are you doing?

1445
01:11:59,667 --> 01:12:03,625
I'm sorry, I couldn't say... yes
to your proposal

1446
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:05,583
in front of all those people.

1447
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,292
You were never going
to say yes.

1448
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,792
I clean teeth,
and I wear seersucker.

1449
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,625
Yeah, but you were
rockin' it, man!

1450
01:12:23,292 --> 01:12:26,750
Lake patrol, this is
S.S. Party Boat. Come in, over.

1451
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:28,542
Well, well, well. Let me guess,

1452
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:31,458
that menace of a ship of yours
ran out of gas,

1453
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:32,956
you've got a passenger
that's about

1454
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,958
to commit harakari
off the bow,

1455
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,458
and you're on this radio
to beg for mercy.

1456
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,667
Well, guess what?

1457
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:41,417
You're not getting
any mercy, Meadows.

1458
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:43,625
No. Say the word.

1459
01:12:43,667 --> 01:12:45,750
I want to hear you say
the word,

1460
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:49,625
and we can call this off
once and for all.

1461
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:50,833
Over.

1462
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:55,667
I just wanted to say that

1463
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:58,790
your people have
the most beautiful skin.

1464
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:04,292
And you are a wonderful,
wonderful swimmer.

1465
01:13:05,792 --> 01:13:07,292
Uhh, you okay?

1466
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:09,958
Flyin' high.

1467
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:25,375
Mayday.

1468
01:13:25,417 --> 01:13:26,500
Greg.

1469
01:13:27,542 --> 01:13:28,583
Baby, just come down.

1470
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:31,625
Okay? We'll go to shore.

1471
01:13:31,667 --> 01:13:34,625
We'll get your leg fixed,
and we will talk about this.

1472
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:36,667
You know, I always thought

1473
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:39,333
Max didn't like me
because I'm an orthodontist.

1474
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:42,917
Tonight I realized it didn't
have anything to do with me.

1475
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:46,917
It was always about you.

1476
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:49,708
I'm allergic to dogs,
and I clean retainers.

1477
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:52,792
I thought I could dance, but...

1478
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:55,583
Now I know.

1479
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:57,417
Oh, what's the point.

1480
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:58,958
- Whoa, whoa! Hey!
- Whoa! Hey, man!

1481
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,750
Hey! Greg, We got you

1482
01:14:00,792 --> 01:14:03,875
a lifetime supply
of Allegra at Costco.

1483
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:08,375
You make
people's smiles straighter.

1484
01:14:08,417 --> 01:14:10,667
Without you, I would have
never opened the shelter.

1485
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:13,375
You force me to believe
in myself.

1486
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:18,458
Greg...

1487
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:20,708
it's Max again.

1488
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:25,625
Uhm, I've known Kiley
since fourth grade

1489
01:14:25,667 --> 01:14:29,125
and you've known her,
what, two years?

1490
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:31,208
So, that kind of makes you
a Kiley novice.

1491
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:34,290
- Shut up, Max!
- No, no, no, I-I got this.

1492
01:14:34,292 --> 01:14:35,458
Trust me.

1493
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:41,000
Greg, listen to me,
you two left-footed

1494
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:42,125
son of a bitch.

1495
01:14:42,167 --> 01:14:44,125
She loves you.

1496
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:45,583
No, she doesn't.

1497
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:46,708
Yes, she does.

1498
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,083
Just tell him.

1499
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:51,625
Come on, Kiley.

1500
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,000
Just take the plunge.

1501
01:14:55,042 --> 01:14:57,500
Oh, no, no, no, no. Not...

1502
01:14:58,958 --> 01:14:59,958
Not you!

1503
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:03,708
Jesus, this guy's so literal.

1504
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:05,623
Hey,

1505
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:06,958
you know what you have to do.

1506
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:10,500
You can't be afraid
to move forward.

1507
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:12,667
I love you,

1508
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:14,917
but so does he.

1509
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:18,125
And I know that you love him.

1510
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:22,083
You can do this.

1511
01:15:51,792 --> 01:15:53,292
Gregory Hampton Kim...

1512
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:56,417
will you marry me?

1513
01:16:10,917 --> 01:16:12,417
Attention, everyone!

1514
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:14,708
I would like to present

1515
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,833
the future Mr. and Mrs....

1516
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:18,792
Nobody cares. Okay?

1517
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:27,958
What are you doing on our boat?

1518
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,167
Your buddy got on the radio
and said those magic words.

1519
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:32,456
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Which gives me

1520
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:34,333
full authority
to come on board

1521
01:16:34,417 --> 01:16:35,417
and commandeer your vessel,

1522
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,250
so I'm commandeering
your vessel.

1523
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:40,875
Hicks over here is gonna write
you guys so many tickets,

1524
01:16:40,917 --> 01:16:42,290
you'll never pay them off.

1525
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:43,750
You'll think your student loan
is a nickel

1526
01:16:43,792 --> 01:16:44,917
found in the couch.

1527
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:46,167
I've waited ten years
for tonight.

1528
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:48,250
Ten years since we...

1529
01:16:48,292 --> 01:16:50,250
caught you counseling
that kid in the bathroom

1530
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:51,750
and got you kicked
off the force.

1531
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,542
Mmm.

1532
01:16:55,917 --> 01:16:58,250
What is that, Hi-C?

1533
01:16:58,292 --> 01:17:00,417
You're a pussy,
and I'm embarrassed for you.

1534
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:03,290
This is like a, what,
a high school reunion?

1535
01:17:03,292 --> 01:17:04,500
Is that what you guys
are doing here,

1536
01:17:04,542 --> 01:17:05,625
getting the gang
back together?

1537
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:06,958
You got the Hawaiian shirt guy.

1538
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,750
We have the theater nerds,
still playing dress-up.

1539
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,292
What are you, forty?
What are you doing?

1540
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:14,623
What is this?
We got the teen mom,

1541
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:16,958
still trying to convince
everybody she's still hot.

1542
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,208
Mm-mm. Luke warm.

1543
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:21,042
Very high luke warm,
don't get me wrong.

1544
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:22,208
There's the popular girl,

1545
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,625
still playing
with all the boys' heads.

1546
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:26,875
Then we got the wise ass.

1547
01:17:26,917 --> 01:17:29,625
Everything you say gets
everybody else in trouble.

1548
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:31,042
You know that?

1549
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:32,333
Then we have the know-it-all.

1550
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:33,958
Well, guess what, Sean?
You're not a know-it-all

1551
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,417
because you partnered
with a wise ass,

1552
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:37,167
your boat ran out of gas
and it sunk,

1553
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:39,542
and that's why I'm here.
You're done.

1554
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:43,042
In two days, you guys are going
to be pumping gas, you follow?

1555
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,333
You're gonna be pump...

1556
01:17:46,292 --> 01:17:47,792
Wow.

1557
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:49,333
There is-you can tear it.

1558
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:52,458
Pumpin'... Pumpin' gas.

1559
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,792
Pumpin' ga... Whoa!

1560
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:57,625
Fishies. Pumping... Pumping gas.

1561
01:17:57,667 --> 01:18:01,417
Pumping gas,
pumping gas, pumping gas.

1562
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:04,583
Pump's a funny word! There are
two P's. Pumping gas!

1563
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:06,958
What in the hell is going on?

1564
01:18:07,042 --> 01:18:09,583
So, you know how Chuck has been
snatching cups out of my hand

1565
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:12,292
and chugging 'em
since we were freshman?

1566
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:13,750
I took a couple
of those Combo Locks

1567
01:18:13,792 --> 01:18:15,208
and put them in my drink.

1568
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:17,333
Pumping gas,
pumping gas, I'm pumping gas.

1569
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:18,458
Pumping gas.

1570
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,708
Come on, let's go.

1571
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:24,667
- Are you serious?
- I am.

1572
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:26,875
- Boogie-woogie-woogie...
- Whoo!

1573
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:28,790
Whoo! Volume!

1574
01:18:28,792 --> 01:18:31,875
I believe Officer Walsh
is asking for some volume.

1575
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,623
Would you like to provide
the man with some volume?

1576
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:35,000
I think I would.

1577
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:54,792
Are you sure you're okay?

1578
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,625
Yeah, Max gave me
some aspirin!

1579
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:57,875
Wha...

1580
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:03,500
Hey, sparky,
what's your full name,

1581
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:04,958
rank, and badge number?

1582
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,956
Lake Everett Patrolman
Chuck Walsh,

1583
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:10,500
badge number 2-5-5-3!

1584
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:13,625
2-5-5-3! Whoo!

1585
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:15,623
And what are you doing
on this boat?

1586
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:17,417
I'm tripping balls!

1587
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:18,790
What was that?

1588
01:19:18,792 --> 01:19:20,290
I'm tripping balls!

1589
01:19:20,292 --> 01:19:22,417
Yeah, I'm tripping balls!

1590
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:47,625
Yo!

1591
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:50,792
Sorry I dosed
your partner, Hicks.

1592
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:53,667
Not even worried about it.

1593
01:19:53,708 --> 01:19:55,167
Looks like
I'm getting bumped up.

1594
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:59,667
Also...

1595
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:01,623
looks like you won't be needing
these citations.

1596
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:03,500
Hey!

1597
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,792
My man!

1598
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:07,750
- Let's party!
- Let's party!

1599
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:09,958
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have
any spare gas, would you?

1600
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:11,917
I think I got a few cans. Yeah.

1601
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:13,333
Let's party, man.

1602
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:14,542
Let's party.

1603
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:35,458
I gotta say,

1604
01:20:36,542 --> 01:20:37,792
epic party, Max.

1605
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,083
Thank you.

1606
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:41,625
You know, I got some ideas
on how to cut costs.

1607
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:43,000
Get a little leaner,

1608
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:45,123
except you'll have
to show me the, uh...

1609
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:47,708
- The books.
- Yes!

1610
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:50,625
Then again you'll have to
tell me what the numbers mean.

1611
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:52,250
Absolutely.

1612
01:20:52,292 --> 01:20:54,208
But you do know tonight wasn't
all about the money, right?

1613
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:57,292
I know.

1614
01:21:00,417 --> 01:21:02,208
I'm really proud of you,
Seanie boy.

1615
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,833
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1616
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:05,042
For what?

1617
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:06,583
Standing up to Walsh
the way that you did.

1618
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:07,750
That took...

1619
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:10,208
You know?

1620
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:14,292
I also want to thank you
for always having my back too.

1621
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:17,542
Tonight, last week...

1622
01:21:17,625 --> 01:21:18,833
the last twenty years.

1623
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,125
Dude. First mates forever.

1624
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:27,458
Ah, Seanie,

1625
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,750
I love ya. Always have.

1626
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:32,792
I love you too.

1627
01:21:34,875 --> 01:21:37,417
- Now...
- Uh, there it is.

1628
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:39,042
- Oh! Oh!
- There it is.

1629
01:21:39,083 --> 01:21:40,792
- There it is.
- Hold on. Hold on. Look at this.

1630
01:21:44,542 --> 01:21:45,583
Cheers.

1631
01:21:46,667 --> 01:21:47,792
Mmm.

1632
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:51,125
- Whoo!
- What do you say

1633
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:53,208
we show these people
how to really party?

1634
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:54,792
Especially that girl
right there.

1635
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:57,290
- Right there? Let's go.
- Yeah.

1636
01:21:57,292 --> 01:22:01,456
Let us dance til' dawn! Arrgh!

1637
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:02,792
Body roll!

1638
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:05,417
Fly, Carmichael. Arrr!

1639
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:45,833
That was the best party
of my life!

1640
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:48,623
I'm telling everyone
you guys rock!

1641
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:50,125
Awesome.

1642
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:52,750
Please let me stay!

1643
01:22:52,792 --> 01:22:54,456
I wanna live on this boat!

1644
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:56,956
- Thank you.
- You don't gotta go home,

1645
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:59,292
but you gotta get
the hell out of here!

1646
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:00,458
Thank you, guys.

1647
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,125
Eomma, I hope we showed you
a good time.

1648
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:04,875
It was the night of my life.

1649
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:08,125
What the hell was that?

1650
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:10,292
That's the S.S. Party Boat
weaving its magic,

1651
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:12,000
that's what that is.

1652
01:23:12,042 --> 01:23:15,417
Uh, should we get breakfast?

1653
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:16,958
It's on me.

1654
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,042
Ooh.

1655
01:23:22,542 --> 01:23:25,123
That guy's crazy.
It might work out.

1656
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,667
Guys, this is my masterpiece.

1657
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:29,292
- Too bad you have to delete that.
- Mm-hmm.

1658
01:23:29,333 --> 01:23:30,833
Freedom of the press, no way!

1659
01:23:30,917 --> 01:23:32,956
What! What happens on the party
boat stays on the party boat.

1660
01:23:32,958 --> 01:23:33,958
Stays.

1661
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:36,456
Guys,

1662
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:38,042
I can't thank you enough.

1663
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:39,290
Oh, Greg, you don't have
to do this.

1664
01:23:39,292 --> 01:23:40,583
Tha-That party was a disaster.

1665
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:42,000
Hey. She said yes, right?

1666
01:23:42,042 --> 01:23:44,417
Well, technically, she said no,
but then you said yes.

1667
01:23:45,417 --> 01:23:46,792
I'm a man of my word.

1668
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:49,458
You should really hang out
with us more often, Greg.

1669
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,667
- Really?
- Yeah.

1670
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:52,833
It's good with me, matey.

1671
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:55,542
Well, just take it easy
on the mateys.

1672
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:56,833
Okay?

1673
01:23:58,208 --> 01:23:59,958
I'm gonna go catch up
with my Eomma, all right?

1674
01:24:08,792 --> 01:24:11,292
So, floating wedding next year?

1675
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,123
Again, about everything,
I'm really sorry and...

1676
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:19,208
Stop it.
You threw a great party,

1677
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:22,125
and you gave me the greatest
proposal story of all time.

1678
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:24,250
Anything for my first mate.

1679
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:26,417
Come here.

1680
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:36,333
L-Let go.

1681
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:38,292
- Hmm? Oh, yeah.
- Let go.

1682
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:39,417
My bad.

1683
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:42,500
Congratulations.

1684
01:24:42,542 --> 01:24:44,375
Thanks, I'll see you soon.

1685
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:45,667
You got it.

1686
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:52,417
- Wow.
- Yep.

1687
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:53,625
Our work here is done.

1688
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:55,917
- And nobody died.
- Nobody died

1689
01:25:04,417 --> 01:25:06,458
Hey, Sean!

1690
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,167
- You know what I was thinking?
- What's that?

1691
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:09,792
- Tahiti.
- Tahiti?

1692
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:11,000
- Tahiti.
- You wanna do Tahiti?

1693
01:25:11,042 --> 01:25:12,208
- Absolutely.
- We should do Tahiti.

1694
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:13,333
Sailboat.

1695
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:16,042
- You like it?
- Dude, I love it.

1696
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:17,500
You know what?
I do like Tahiti.

1697
01:25:17,542 --> 01:25:19,458
I'm telling you man,
stick with me,

1698
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,417
- I'll make all your dreams come true.
- We're going places,

1699
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:22,708
we're going places.

1700
01:25:22,792 --> 01:25:25,708
Tahiti!

1701
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:27,667
We're coming for you, bitches.

1702
01:25:27,708 --> 01:25:30,750
- Oh, God.
- No rush. There's no rush.

1703
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,125
Hey, Hicks, what's Eddie Van
Halen look like in real life?

1704
01:25:33,167 --> 01:25:34,623
I don't know. Get to the bed.

1705
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:36,623
- Three locks, three locks.
- Get to the bed. Get to the bed.

1706
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:38,456
I'm going! You're not even
on the bed.

1707
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:40,292
- I know I'm not.
- Oh, my God.

1708
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:42,790
You know what? You need
a quesadilla. You need one.

1709
01:25:42,792 --> 01:25:44,042
No, no, no, lay down.
Lay down.

1710
01:25:44,083 --> 01:25:45,708
- Walsh!
- What?

1711
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,375
- Lay down!
- I got muenster in the fridge.

1712
01:25:47,417 --> 01:25:48,833
Lay down and relax!

1713
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:50,625
I'm relaxed, you're the one
that's not relaxed.

1714
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:53,042
Alright, Walsh.
I'll see you later.

1715
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:54,083
Probably at your hearing.

1716
01:25:54,125 --> 01:25:56,083
At my hearing.

1717
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:58,083
I can hear.

1718
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:01,500
Hicksy, slide me over
one of those buckets, okay?

1719
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:04,290
Which one?

1720
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:06,125
It's too early to tell.

1721
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:10,208
You know what, just scoot over.

1722
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:13,456
You're too wasted
to leave alone,

1723
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:15,167
and I'm too tired
to go home, so...

1724
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:21,208
Big spoon or little spoon?

1725
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,708
It's too early to tell.

1726
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:32,000
Are you sure this bed is...

1727
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:38,042
Oh, God.

1728
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:39,625
I can smell your sunscreen.

1729
01:26:40,875 --> 01:26:42,917
Go to bed, Walsh.

1730
01:29:37,076 --> 01:29:42,076
