0
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:21,818
I was born out of a
womb into a world of a sin.

1
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:28,250
I had seizures as a child

2
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,188
and slept in rooms with no heat.

3
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:36,689
Anger and I have always been best friends.

4
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:42,874
I've seen people die in front of my face

5
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,250
and I hurt innocent people for money.

6
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:52,114
I have slept on dirt floors

7
00:00:52,164 --> 00:00:54,902
and sold drugs to empty souls.

8
00:00:54,952 --> 00:00:58,399
I got drunk, fought in bars

9
00:00:59,405 --> 00:01:01,098
and always smiled to hide the pain.

10
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:06,488
But you God, you found me

11
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,539
and decided enough was enough.

12
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:46,783
I see your sarcoma is very rare,

13
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:50,972
especially for someone of your age, Devin.

14
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:53,760
It usually forms while
the bone is still growing.

15
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,012
Now, I noticed that
you've had an injury here

16
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:57,504
in the past.

17
00:02:57,554 --> 00:02:59,221
How recent was that?

18
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,159
A couple years ago.

19
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,098
That's what I thought.

20
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:10,738
You see your skull had
to grow to fuse that crack

21
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:13,408
and that most likely
activated the cancerous cell.

22
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:20,439
Now, due to it's proximity to your brain,

23
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:23,239
this tumor's extremely dangerous.

24
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:27,581
From what we can
see, it's very aggressive,

25
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:30,588
it's grown three millimeters
in the past month.

26
00:03:30,638 --> 00:03:34,138
So, we need to act quickly and decisively.

27
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,512
The good news is, Devin, if we can remove

28
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:45,832
all of this cancerous growth,

29
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:48,748
we may be able to prevent it
from spreading to your brain.

30
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:53,069
But you most likely will lose your eye.

31
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:57,728
I'm gonna start radiation immediately,

32
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:00,518
try to shrink this tumor down

33
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:03,883
enough so we can have
a successful surgery.

34
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:08,510
I'm gonna get in there and
get all the cancerous bone out.

35
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:12,089
It definitely will help
us to prevent it from

36
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,139
spreading to your brain.

37
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:46,126
All I want right now
is a nice glass of wine.

38
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:48,430
My company isn't good enough for you?

39
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:51,958
Besides you know you can't tonight.

40
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:55,826
I know, I know, I
know, I'll tell you what,

41
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:57,358
how about you get you a glass,

42
00:04:57,408 --> 00:04:58,883
then you can let me sniff it.

43
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:04,691
Hey is your mom all set with Izzy?

44
00:05:05,793 --> 00:05:08,748
Yeah, I've got the whole week planned,

45
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,791
the zoo, an ice cream date.

46
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:14,638
Really, sounds like a good plan.

47
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:17,549
I'll tell you what, let's
do that when I get home.

48
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,894
Ice cream is like the perfect desert,

49
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,518
can't go wrong with it, keeps you focused.

50
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,531
Besides, if you're not focused

51
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:26,024
then you'll leave a big ol' mess

52
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:28,277
but the mess can be delicious

53
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:30,405
if it's your favorite flavor.

54
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,535
And what is my favorite flavor?

55
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:34,752
That's easy.

56
00:05:39,057 --> 00:05:41,815
Cookies - Cookies and cream.

57
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,734
See, I told you.

58
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:49,117
But at least I know Izzy's
favorite flavor, vanilla.

59
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:56,685
Vanilla.

60
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:04,606
Thank you.

61
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:15,479
So, when's your mom visiting?

62
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:18,892
She don't know yet, I
mean, I keep trying to tell her

63
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:21,409
not to worry about it, she
just have to get updates

64
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,306
from you throughout the week.

65
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:25,846
You probably really
want her here though, right?

66
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,514
Honestly, I really
don't think she'd be able

67
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,711
to handle the stress.

68
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:36,209
I mean, think about it,
12 days, I'll give her two

69
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,313
before she running around here stressing,

70
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:40,469
then we gonna have to
give her own hospital room.

71
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:53,878
Hey, how are you holding up, though?

72
00:06:55,553 --> 00:07:00,607
Me, you're the one that has
to go through this thing and

73
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,226
And you're the one

74
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:04,547
who has to watch me go through it, so.

75
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:13,641
That is the reason
I fell in love with you.

76
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,606
Aww, bull, you fell in love with me

77
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,937
because I'm God's gift to women

78
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:21,958
and you just couldn't help yourself.

79
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,591
You're so stupid.

80
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:34,517
Thank you.

81
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,225
Day one, do not be anxious about anything

82
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:51,026
but in every situation,
by prayer and petition

83
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,523
with thanksgiving, present
your requests to God.

84
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,211
Mr. Sherman.

85
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:07,898
They're ready for you.

86
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:19,781
- Can you give me one second?
- Yeah.

87
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,441
- Hey cuz.
- What's up?

88
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,257
I just wanna let you know, man,

89
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:50,214
if anything happens, I'm gonna take care

90
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:51,685
of them girls for you.

91
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:54,397
I know you would cuz

92
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:55,882
but I'm gonna be all right.

93
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:59,018
Have a little faith, man, all right?

94
00:09:09,393 --> 00:09:11,310
I'm gonna be all right.

95
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:24,342
Okay, Devin, this is it.

96
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,244
We're gonna do
everything we can to extract

97
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:28,676
this tumor from you.

98
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:31,138
Right now I just want you to relax

99
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:35,170
and count backwards from 60 for me, okay?

100
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,530
60, 59, 58, 57

101
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,445
I did a reconstruction here,

102
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:00,824
- I'm done.
- Good.

103
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:04,696
- See the posterior orbit.
- All right, excellent.

104
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,386
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

105
00:10:36,795 --> 00:10:38,712
Oh, look, our heroes.

106
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:43,549
What took you all so long,
growing a beard or something?

107
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,897
Go on and finish your meat.

108
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:55,706
I can't believe you did that.

109
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:05,883
- Yo.
- What?

110
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:09,019
He just grabbed me.

111
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,319
Yo, hold this real quick.

112
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:13,682
Yo!

113
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:18,589
All right brother.

114
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:19,665
Yo!

115
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:41,551
- Level sufficient.
- Excellent.

116
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:09,724
I definitely can't afford her.

117
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:13,492
You're gonna be single

118
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:15,196
for the rest of your life, aren't you?

119
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:16,989
I'm gonna find me a budget woman,

120
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,054
a real nice layaway lady.

121
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,430
Oh, Lord.

122
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:22,278
Let me see that.

123
00:12:26,232 --> 00:12:29,670
- You and these women.
- I love them.

124
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:44,779
We had to make a slight change

125
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,386
in our approach to your
husband's procedure.

126
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,893
Oh wait, what do you mean, change?

127
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:50,938
Where's Dr. Kirman, is everything okay?

128
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:53,200
Dr. Kirman is in surgery.

129
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,568
I'm a member of his team.

130
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:58,336
We found that the tumor was a lot closer

131
00:12:58,397 --> 00:13:00,268
to his brain than we originally thought.

132
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:04,498
This leaves us very little room for error.

133
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:09,754
Now, in cases like this, we
would bring in the neurosurgeon

134
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,826
to handle the procedure.

135
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:15,342
And as it turns out, we
have the finest neurosurgeon

136
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:17,893
in the northeast right in this hospital.

137
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:22,481
And as luck would have it,
his schedule just opened up.

138
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:26,789
He gives us our best
chance to remove the tumor

139
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,075
and save Devin's eye.

140
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:31,436
Is there anything I can do?

141
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:37,976
Just try everything you
can to be comfortable.

142
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:41,132
The schedule for the
surgery is about six hours.

143
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:51,447
You know, there's a private
lounge where you can wait,

144
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,143
if you think you'd be more comfortable.

145
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:58,105
Sure, thank you.

146
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:04,771
We really need to get you to the hospital.

147
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:08,100
I'm fine, it's just a little cut.

148
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,579
No, my car is soaked in blood

149
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,902
and you're still bleeding everywhere.

150
00:14:14,057 --> 00:14:15,557
I said I'm fine.

151
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:20,477
I don't know why you
gotta be so stubborn.

152
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,145
I'm gonna be okay.

153
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,599
They're lucky I didn't have my gun.

154
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,703
Devin, you can't be like that.

155
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,936
And they can't just walk around

156
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,675
grabbing on women like that either.

157
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:30,899
What'd you expect for me to do,

158
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:32,443
just stand there and don't do nothing?

159
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:34,130
Yes, absolutely.

160
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:38,068
What if they were holding, huh, what then?

161
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:45,679
Hey, I can't sit by and
watch you get yourself killed.

162
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,216
I need you alive.

163
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:53,185
This is real isn't it?

164
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:56,269
This cut, yeah, it's real.

165
00:14:57,525 --> 00:15:00,275
You really should go - Marry me.

166
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,145
You got hit by that
wrench a little harder

167
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:06,623
than you thought.

168
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:08,651
I'm serious.

169
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,083
You're in shock.

170
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:16,108
All right, hold that
thought, I'll be right back.

171
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:20,835
Hey, you know you
really should lie down.

172
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:44,402
Lisa Keyonis will you marry me?

173
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,288
You gotta answer, you know,

174
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:49,815
I'm getting kinda woozy over here.

175
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:52,687
Yes, yes, of course, yes.

176
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:29,632
You know what guys, I'm
so glad we're in this hospital

177
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:32,857
'cause after drinking this,
I'm gonna need a doctor.

178
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:36,572
- So, why even drink it?
- 'Cause I am a man

179
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:38,530
who love to gamble.

180
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,645
I don't think that's a good idea.

181
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:43,710
Looks like it's been there
since they freed the slaves,

182
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,536
in Egypt.

183
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:49,187
Well, let my people go.

184
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,713
I said, let my people go.

185
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:58,858
Ooh, you're right, this needs some sugar

186
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:00,926
and I mean a lot.

187
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:06,136
Hey, Paige, how'd
your cousin Robbie die?

188
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:09,101
Oh, you know, just drinking
rancid hospital coffee.

189
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:11,405
Why would he do that?

190
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:15,327
I don't know, I'd ask
him myself but he's dead.

191
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:34,537
Here's where we're at.

192
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:41,101
The tumor has breached the membrane

193
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:45,643
that separates the orbital socket

194
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:48,714
from the outside skin and muscle

195
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:53,381
that essentially make up
the outline of Devin's face.

196
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:55,911
And?

197
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:01,369
And it looks like we're
gonna have to remove his eye.

198
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,827
It'll dramatically improve the odds

199
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:11,254
of our being able to
completely remove the tumor.

200
00:18:14,757 --> 00:18:18,344
We need your consent to take his eye.

201
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:23,881
It's our best hope, making sure that Devin

202
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:25,692
can live a long life.

203
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:34,549
If you have to, take his eye.

204
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:37,044
Okay.

205
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:47,314
- Morning Debbie.
- Morning June.

206
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:56,817
You're here early.

207
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:58,529
I've been awake for hours.

208
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:03,011
You and me both,
sister, you and me both.

209
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:52,086
- Hey babe.
- Hey.

210
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:04,929
While you were in surgery,

211
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,665
the doctors came and

212
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,933
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey I love you

213
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:20,215
and no matter what I always will, okay?

214
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,299
Don't worry about it, it's gonna be okay.

215
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,167
Would you like your receipt in the bag?

216
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,583
- No thank you.
- Oh, okay.

217
00:21:38,904 --> 00:21:40,842
All right, get this in here for you.

218
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:44,873
You have a blessed day.

219
00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:46,174
- Thank you, you too.
- You too.

220
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,294
Thank you.

221
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:48,688
I sure will try.

222
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:01,734
- Lisa?
- Hi Debbie.

223
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:05,012
The doctors
think that they got most

224
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:06,447
of the tumor but - What?

225
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:09,120
They wanted to take his eye.

226
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:10,564
Why'd they have to do that?

227
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,130
Okay, they
haven't taken it yet but,

228
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:15,409
sorry, okay, Debbie, look I'm
gonna need to call you back.

229
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,383
Okay, all right just call
me okay, just let me know.

230
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:19,891
I will, Debbie.

231
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:20,986
Just let me know.

232
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:22,118
I will.

233
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,522
Deb, are you okay?

234
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,496
- No.
- Oh, honey.

235
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:33,617
Tom, will you please?

236
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:35,255
- It's my baby.
- Honey, come on,

237
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:36,633
let's go sit down.

238
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,712
- It's my baby.
- Come on, let's go sit.

239
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:42,512
Oh God!

240
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,516
- June.
- Oh, honey.

241
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:50,588
It's okay hon, it's okay.

242
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,351
Oh Jesus.

243
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:04,858
Tell me what's happening.

244
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:11,984
I just wanna be there
with him for the surgery.

245
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,126
I am his mother.

246
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:20,523
I'm supposed to be there to tell him

247
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:23,051
that everything is gonna
be all right and I can't.

248
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:30,214
Why can't you?

249
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:34,611
I can't keep it together around here.

250
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:38,033
Can you see me at that hospital?

251
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:41,139
- Oh Lord.
- Debbie, I get it,

252
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:43,109
I'd be a wreck

253
00:23:43,145 --> 00:23:46,755
if one of my girls had, well,
something like that happening

254
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:51,194
but hon, you know better than anyone,

255
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:54,283
faith is confidence in what we hope for

256
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,276
and evidence of what we don't see.

257
00:23:58,595 --> 00:24:00,738
Deb, God's got this.

258
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:07,086
God's got this.

259
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,199
God has got this.

260
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,668
Thank you, thank you.

261
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,111
Day three,
let us love one another,

262
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:29,592
for love comes from God.

263
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:40,339
Hey, I know how awful
the hospital food tastes,

264
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,542
so I brought you some sanchocho for lunch.

265
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:45,092
My Aunt Willa made it for you.

266
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:51,665
Baby, you're gonna be
okay, you know that right?

267
00:24:52,848 --> 00:24:55,249
- You can go.
- Babe.

268
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:59,460
I said, you can go.

269
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,427
But if I don't who will?

270
00:26:34,614 --> 00:26:39,693
I'll say, Willa, I
know but it's so hard.

271
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,785
How did you get so smart?

272
00:28:07,177 --> 00:28:08,844
Are you all right?

273
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:13,473
You know, you really
should stay in your bed.

274
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:23,715
Anything you need, you
know, all you have to do

275
00:28:23,776 --> 00:28:25,773
is push the nurse call button next to you.

276
00:28:30,581 --> 00:28:33,604
- Mirror.
- Excuse me?

277
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:36,688
Please.

278
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:41,853
Mirror, you sure, it says on your chart

279
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,612
that you're scheduled
for reconstructive surgery.

280
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:47,776
I need to, want to see, please.

281
00:28:48,482 --> 00:28:49,482
Sure.

282
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:34,572
Mr. Duplas, good afternoon.

283
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:37,712
Thanks for coming out.

284
00:29:44,477 --> 00:29:45,829
Hopefully this won't take long.

285
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,865
I just wanted you to know where we was at.

286
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:51,029
I sent the designs to your people again.

287
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,649
I really hope that they understand

288
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,489
what it is that I'm asking for.

289
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:58,347
Devin, I've given you
a lot of money, a lot.

290
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:00,909
I'm not throwing my money away, am I?

291
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,786
Mr. Duplas, I promise
you, this will get done

292
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:05,754
as you request it, as soon as possible.

293
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,955
But according to my emails,

294
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:08,398
we still haven't received the permits

295
00:30:08,422 --> 00:30:09,422
from the last time we

296
00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:10,483
Permits!

297
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,120
Devin, this is going to be my legacy,

298
00:30:15,087 --> 00:30:17,032
something I can leave my children.

299
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:19,315
Now, I've given you the money,

300
00:30:20,202 --> 00:30:22,266
so if you can figure
out how to do your job.

301
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:24,261
You need to watch your tone.

302
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,802
This will get done.

303
00:30:25,852 --> 00:30:27,328
We still haven't received the payments

304
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:28,215
from the last time - Are you asking me

305
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:29,665
for even more money now.

306
00:30:29,726 --> 00:30:31,049
According to our agreement.

307
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,328
As much as I've already given you.

308
00:30:33,787 --> 00:30:35,132
You better be lucky I
don't have you arrested

309
00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:36,581
for embezzlement boy.

310
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,780
Boy, is this a joke.

311
00:30:39,522 --> 00:30:42,439
Nah, you got the wrong one.

312
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:44,318
Maybe I do.

313
00:31:15,711 --> 00:31:17,087
This is Devin.

314
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:19,882
Hey, Devin, I
just got a call from Dupras,

315
00:31:19,932 --> 00:31:21,652
he's demanding the
down payment be returned.

316
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:23,263
What?

317
00:31:23,762 --> 00:31:25,562
I'm out here buying
equipment for the job now,

318
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,997
this is ridiculous.

319
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:28,995
Listen, let me ask you something,

320
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:32,429
did you remind him about
the terms of our contract.

321
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,251
Yeah, I did but he's claiming

322
00:31:34,385 --> 00:31:35,663
that you breached the contract

323
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:37,302
by not meeting the deadline.

324
00:31:37,352 --> 00:31:39,483
You got to be kidding
me, this is out of control!

325
00:31:39,553 --> 00:31:41,414
He knows, he just doesn't care.

326
00:31:42,144 --> 00:31:43,303
He said if he doesn't receive it

327
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:45,099
by the end of the week, he's going to sue.

328
00:31:45,712 --> 00:31:50,598
Sue, sue, I cannot get
the money out of escrow.

329
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,614
He knows, he just doesn't care.

330
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:56,653
I tell you what, tell him if he sues,

331
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,186
he's gonna be dreaming
about me in his coma!

332
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:01,741
Geez!

333
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:10,926
You got to be kidding me.

334
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:15,119
Day five, so do not
fear, for I am with you,

335
00:32:16,206 --> 00:32:18,064
do not be dismayed, for I am your God.

336
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:20,910
I will strengthen you and help you,

337
00:32:21,217 --> 00:32:23,556
I will uphold you with
my righteous right hand.

338
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:32,811
How you doing
today, Mr. Sherman?

339
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:45,465
Oh, your IV is infiltrated.

340
00:32:55,855 --> 00:32:58,738
God, what am I missing?

341
00:33:02,025 --> 00:33:04,538
I promise, you get me out of this,

342
00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:08,338
I'll pray more, I'll go
to church every week.

343
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:12,280
It doesn't have to be like that.

344
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,823
What, praying more,
going to church every week?

345
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,787
Those things are not
terms of a negotiation.

346
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:29,350
Relationships, real relationships,

347
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:31,838
they're not dependent on what

348
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:34,131
have you done for me lately.

349
00:33:38,205 --> 00:33:41,973
Devotion, devotion's a
funny thing, you know.

350
00:33:43,373 --> 00:33:48,248
People get so hung up on
saying things just to say them

351
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:55,079
but showing devotion,
it means so much more.

352
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,932
Devin, go to your
grandmother's and get the iron!

353
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:46,357
I was just about to go
to the corner store, Mom!

354
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:49,042
Yeah, after you get that iron.

355
00:34:49,092 --> 00:34:51,227
I need batteries,
why can't Robbie do it?

356
00:34:51,277 --> 00:34:53,872
Devin, don't make me ask again.

357
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:55,005
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:31,691
Wow, you look beautiful.

359
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,673
Thank you, baby.

360
00:35:35,782 --> 00:35:36,711
Where's Grandpa?

361
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,844
He's around, come here.

362
00:35:50,029 --> 00:35:51,696
What was that for?

363
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,370
- Hey Auntie.
- Hey, Dev.

364
00:36:25,482 --> 00:36:28,482
Debbie, Debbie, Ma just collapsed!

365
00:36:40,252 --> 00:36:44,789
Charlotte, Charlotte,
honey no, Charlotte.

366
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:45,839
No, no.

367
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,713
No, no, no, no, no.

368
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,373
Hey, I brought you some food.

369
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:11,702
- I can't do this.
- What?

370
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,311
This, this is depressing.

371
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:20,737
Who knows how much longer
I'm gonna have to be in here.

372
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,867
I can't tell if it's daytime
or nighttime outside.

373
00:37:26,928 --> 00:37:28,448
You'll survive and before you know it,

374
00:37:28,494 --> 00:37:30,386
you'll be back home and you'll have

375
00:37:30,436 --> 00:37:31,763
all the windows you want.

376
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,943
You think this is a joke!

377
00:37:34,865 --> 00:37:37,367
This is not a game, I
just had my face cut open

378
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,401
for cancer that's in, that was in there.

379
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,292
You don't understand.

380
00:37:46,448 --> 00:37:49,846
I would give anything just
to see the sun right now.

381
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:52,624
I'm sorry, I know how tough it is, babe

382
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,378
I'll just go talk to somebody

383
00:37:54,428 --> 00:37:56,495
and I'll see if they can do anything.

384
00:37:57,062 --> 00:37:58,466
Just try to get some sleep.

385
00:38:00,686 --> 00:38:02,358
That's all I do is sleep!

386
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:04,229
I got my own bed to sleep in!

387
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:07,505
I'm ready to go home, you understand!

388
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:09,221
Fine.

389
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,319
Excuse me.

390
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,002
Yeah.

391
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:34,874
I need to see about moving my husband

392
00:38:34,935 --> 00:38:36,935
to a room with a window.

393
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:39,462
I'm sorry we can't do that.

394
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,746
What do you mean you can't?

395
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,728
Well, all of our rooms are filled.

396
00:38:44,211 --> 00:38:45,851
- Who's your supervisor?
- Ma'am we can't.

397
00:38:45,972 --> 00:38:47,907
You know what, never mind.

398
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:49,645
I'm just gonna call my lawyer.

399
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:51,815
This will be an easy fix, 'cause
I'm gonna sue the hospital.

400
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:52,898
What's your name?

401
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,922
Hi, Mr. Stanis.

402
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,725
Actually, I may have misspoken.

403
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,418
We should have a room with
a view opening up tomorrow.

404
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:05,301
I'm gonna have to call you back.

405
00:39:10,024 --> 00:39:11,024
Thank you.

406
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:18,465
Day seven

407
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:21,736
give your burdens to the Lord

408
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:23,484
and he will take care of you.

409
00:39:33,626 --> 00:39:35,876
I got this, you got that.

410
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:24,817
Thank you, Lord.

411
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:30,655
Thank you for your peace and
for your strength, I thank you.

412
00:40:42,296 --> 00:40:45,038
All right, let me get
you some fresh bandages.

413
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,757
- Hey Dev.
- Hey Mom.

414
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,090
Hey.

415
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:59,206
Looks like you have a nice view.

416
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:03,452
Yeah, the view is beautiful

417
00:41:04,148 --> 00:41:06,113
but I'll feel so much
better once I'm out of here.

418
00:41:08,662 --> 00:41:10,802
Are you eating, is the food good?

419
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:16,625
Oh wow, Lisa's grandma
been making me sanchocho

420
00:41:17,172 --> 00:41:20,920
every day, so, I'm fine.

421
00:41:22,124 --> 00:41:23,778
But how are you holding up?

422
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:26,385
Oh God, Devin, your face.

423
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,655
See, Ma, I told you.

424
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:38,417
I'm alive.

425
00:41:38,784 --> 00:41:41,090
I know, Devin and I'm thankful for that

426
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:43,411
but it's your face.

427
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,399
Listen, I'm kinda tired right now

428
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,939
so, why don't you go
home, you get you some rest

429
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,944
and I'll give you a call later.

430
00:41:55,005 --> 00:42:00,134
Okay, just make me a promise,

431
00:42:01,048 --> 00:42:04,968
that you're gonna call
me if you need anything

432
00:42:05,029 --> 00:42:07,200
and I mean anything.

433
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:08,734
I will.

434
00:42:09,678 --> 00:42:11,602
Okay.

435
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:21,122
- I love you, son.
- I love you too, Mom.

436
00:42:23,094 --> 00:42:29,014
Mom, listen, God got this.

437
00:42:31,317 --> 00:42:34,494
God's got this.

438
00:42:34,555 --> 00:42:35,731
Say it with me.

439
00:42:36,114 --> 00:42:38,574
- God's got this.
- God's got this.

440
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,481
God's got this.

441
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:46,790
- Go get some rest.
- All right.

442
00:43:02,408 --> 00:43:03,987
Okay, it's go time.

443
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:05,943
I'm gonna get you in and get you under,

444
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,659
then when you wake up your
face will be almost as good

445
00:43:07,683 --> 00:43:09,152
as the one God gave you.

446
00:43:12,735 --> 00:43:15,111
You're in very good
hands for this procedure.

447
00:43:15,678 --> 00:43:19,276
You'll have some of the
best technically skilled hands

448
00:43:19,337 --> 00:43:22,497
in the world working to
repair your wonderful face.

449
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:25,353
Bye.

450
00:43:27,473 --> 00:43:29,680
Hey, can we come in?

451
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:31,459
Of course.

452
00:43:37,575 --> 00:43:39,394
You ready for this, cuz?

453
00:43:41,456 --> 00:43:42,539
Absolutely.

454
00:43:50,224 --> 00:43:52,307
As ready as I'll ever be.

455
00:44:29,142 --> 00:44:31,245
How long before
I'd have that iliac cusp bone?

456
00:44:33,153 --> 00:44:35,770
This is gonna take some time,

457
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:38,676
this is the strongest
bone I have ever cut into.

458
00:45:02,725 --> 00:45:03,904
This is Devin.

459
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:04,899
Good afternoon, Mr. Sherman.

460
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:06,125
Tell me something good.

461
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,252
Well, the good news is you hired

462
00:45:07,276 --> 00:45:10,913
an amazing attorney,
bad news is it's official,

463
00:45:10,979 --> 00:45:12,279
you're being sued.

464
00:45:12,745 --> 00:45:13,605
What?

465
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:16,244
Yeah, I was just
contacted by the attorneys

466
00:45:16,342 --> 00:45:18,269
representing Gerald Duplas.

467
00:45:18,431 --> 00:45:20,959
They're claiming breach of contract.

468
00:45:22,312 --> 00:45:24,140
They're serving papers later today.

469
00:45:25,675 --> 00:45:28,975
Don't worry Devin, we're
gonna take care of this.

470
00:45:29,036 --> 00:45:31,222
You hired the best for a reason.

471
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,920
Just sit back, relax, we're
gonna formulate a plan

472
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:36,295
and I'll update you on it later.

473
00:45:36,545 --> 00:45:37,872
Have a good afternoon.

474
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,388
Doctor.

475
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:12,407
How much are you giving him?

476
00:46:12,655 --> 00:46:15,778
He should be getting
enough, but I'll increase.

477
00:46:16,435 --> 00:46:18,953
Yeah, the measurable show
he's exactly where he needs to be.

478
00:46:19,514 --> 00:46:20,940
He's just

479
00:46:26,293 --> 00:46:27,883
Go back to sleep, Mr. Sherman.

480
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:31,069
We're almost done here.

481
00:47:22,058 --> 00:47:23,058
Hey Mom.

482
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,688
Devin, what are you doing here?

483
00:47:24,738 --> 00:47:27,126
What, I can't come
see my beautiful mother?

484
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:29,467
Mmm-hmm.

485
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,564
Here, I got you your phone.

486
00:47:33,594 --> 00:47:36,782
It's all set up for you and everything.

487
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,603
I had to get me a new one myself, 'cause

488
00:47:41,516 --> 00:47:43,016
my last one broke.

489
00:47:43,379 --> 00:47:45,712
Did it, okay, mm-hmm.

490
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:50,292
Devin, how am I gonna
learn how to use all of this,

491
00:47:50,342 --> 00:47:51,850
who's gonna teach me?

492
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,479
You know I don't know anything

493
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,299
about these I talk thingy thingies.

494
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:58,354
Ma, it's just like your
last one but newer.

495
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:06,002
All right, enough with this phone.

496
00:48:06,722 --> 00:48:11,010
Devin, you are having
surgery in two weeks.

497
00:48:11,983 --> 00:48:13,069
How are you doing?

498
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,641
I'm fine, I'm good.

499
00:48:21,169 --> 00:48:22,169
You good?

500
00:48:30,545 --> 00:48:33,624
Wow, okay, Mom.

501
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:41,872
Ma, it's like, it just don't feel right.

502
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:44,919
It's a lot harder than I thought.

503
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:46,724
You got me thinking about people,

504
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:52,673
like what I did to them
and what they did to me.

505
00:48:53,052 --> 00:48:54,385
What I wanna do.

506
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:59,350
It's hard Mom, it's hard.

507
00:49:01,801 --> 00:49:06,042
That's guilt but I know you know that.

508
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:08,859
Devin, look at me.

509
00:49:11,377 --> 00:49:14,294
You need to make a list, 10 people,

510
00:49:15,032 --> 00:49:17,675
10 people that have done wrong to you,

511
00:49:18,707 --> 00:49:22,960
people that you have wronged
and you need to forgive them.

512
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:27,563
But most of all, you
need to forgive yourself.

513
00:49:30,797 --> 00:49:34,715
Devin, once you do that, you'll be free,

514
00:49:36,122 --> 00:49:38,039
it's out of your hands.

515
00:50:06,015 --> 00:50:07,682
Forgive them, huh?

516
00:50:48,993 --> 00:50:51,945
Mr. Duplas, you got a minute?

517
00:50:54,223 --> 00:50:55,924
Devin, let's not do this here.

518
00:50:55,974 --> 00:50:57,466
I'd like to enjoy my evening.

519
00:50:57,516 --> 00:50:59,795
All right, all right, fine,
fine, listen, listen, please,

520
00:50:59,845 --> 00:51:02,428
give me one second, one second.

521
00:51:03,415 --> 00:51:04,644
I have cancer.

522
00:51:06,573 --> 00:51:07,573
And?

523
00:51:07,928 --> 00:51:11,235
And, do you have kids?

524
00:51:11,974 --> 00:51:13,618
Leave my family out of this.

525
00:51:14,033 --> 00:51:16,226
All right, come on please, come on,

526
00:51:16,276 --> 00:51:18,014
don't, please don't be like this.

527
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:19,314
I need a favor.

528
00:51:20,304 --> 00:51:23,035
If I'm not here to defend this lawsuit,

529
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:25,668
can you please drop it, please?

530
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:30,908
Look, Devin, I'm sorry you're sick, okay

531
00:51:31,308 --> 00:51:34,230
but do me a favor, don't
confuse your personal life

532
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,744
with our business.

533
00:51:36,515 --> 00:51:38,015
Have a good night.

534
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:45,929
You better pray I don't survive this.

535
00:51:49,316 --> 00:51:51,434
- Hey babe.
- Hey.

536
00:52:10,106 --> 00:52:13,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

537
00:52:16,005 --> 00:52:19,338
Have you ever seen anything like this?

538
00:52:21,361 --> 00:52:22,361
Never.

539
00:52:25,264 --> 00:52:26,264
Amazing.

540
00:52:27,592 --> 00:52:29,515
It's like he's got God on his side.

541
00:52:30,131 --> 00:52:31,864
I thought you didn't
believe in that stuff.

542
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:33,774
I don't.

543
00:52:37,164 --> 00:52:38,164
I didn't.

544
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:51,122
Day nine

545
00:52:52,185 --> 00:52:53,742
the tongue has the power of life

546
00:52:53,802 --> 00:52:56,823
and death, and those
who love it will eat it's fruit.

547
00:53:39,501 --> 00:53:43,001
Why are you trying to stand on your own?

548
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:51,121
Because I can't

549
00:54:06,572 --> 00:54:13,311
Okay, okay, I'll trust
you, I'll trust you.

550
00:54:20,801 --> 00:54:25,632
Please help me, please help me.

551
00:54:43,732 --> 00:54:49,159
Faith and patience,
Devin, faith and patience.

552
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:57,570
Hey Mr. Sherman, ready to
get those legs working again?

553
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,299
Yeah, I'm ready.

554
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:07,726
All right, let's get you
up on those parallel bars.

555
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:47,731
Well, Mr. Edwards,
I'm happy you're satisfied

556
00:55:47,792 --> 00:55:49,139
with the results.

557
00:55:50,391 --> 00:55:51,977
Me and my team, we definitely

558
00:55:52,038 --> 00:55:53,643
put our hearts into this project.

559
00:55:53,693 --> 00:55:55,619
Yeah, it
turned out fantastic, thank you.

560
00:55:55,669 --> 00:55:57,382
My pleasure, have a good day.

561
00:55:57,665 --> 00:55:59,665
You too.

562
00:57:43,997 --> 00:57:47,052
You have one unheard message.

563
00:57:48,445 --> 00:57:50,508
This call
is for Mr. Devin Sherman

564
00:57:50,558 --> 00:57:51,912
from Dr. Kirman's office.

565
00:57:52,461 --> 00:57:55,223
We need you to call us
back as soon as you can.

566
00:57:55,284 --> 00:57:57,995
Your latest CT scan actually shows

567
00:57:58,056 --> 00:58:00,938
that the tumor is going
to lead to your brain

568
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:02,480
in a matter of weeks.

569
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:04,442
We need to schedule your surgery sooner

570
00:58:04,503 --> 00:58:06,651
than we had originally thought.

571
00:58:06,712 --> 00:58:09,200
Please call us back at
your earliest convenience.

572
00:58:30,762 --> 00:58:31,762
Come in.

573
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,210
Oh, hey Chach.

574
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:47,473
I'm fine, Pop.

575
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:53,348
Really, well, Chach,
you don't seem fine.

576
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:59,190
I remember when you was a little girl,

577
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,769
you came running in from outside

578
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,991
screaming at the top of your lungs

579
00:59:04,377 --> 00:59:06,473
because you fell on the gravel,

580
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,000
scraped your knee up pretty good,

581
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,085
blood running down your leg,

582
00:59:11,146 --> 00:59:12,722
tears coming down your face.

583
00:59:15,045 --> 00:59:16,712
And you were scared.

584
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:23,179
And you told me, "I'm not
never going outside again,"

585
00:59:24,465 --> 00:59:25,924
all because you was afraid.

586
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:30,292
And you know what I
did, I grabbed your hand,

587
00:59:31,775 --> 00:59:34,218
wiped the tears off your face,

588
00:59:34,268 --> 00:59:37,608
cleaned up your leg and I told you,

589
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:40,713
"No matter what you decide to do,

590
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:43,579
just don't be afraid."

591
00:59:44,987 --> 00:59:48,716
And right now, right now at this moment,

592
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:51,625
I see that same little girl.

593
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,703
So, you know what I'm gonna say?

594
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:58,483
Just don't be afraid.

595
01:00:07,123 --> 01:00:08,373
That's my girl.

596
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:29,285
How you doing today, Mr. Sherman?

597
01:00:29,557 --> 01:00:32,615
I am just fine, thanks for asking.

598
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:34,879
How are you?

599
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:36,345
I'm good.

600
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:38,978
Can I get you anything, Mr. Sherman?

601
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:42,178
You can call me Devin, if you prefer.

602
01:00:42,228 --> 01:00:44,266
Okay, Devin, are you hungry?

603
01:00:44,316 --> 01:00:46,677
Nope, my wife brought me some food.

604
01:00:47,108 --> 01:00:48,461
Well, aren't you lucky.

605
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,213
I hear the food's terrible here.

606
01:00:51,128 --> 01:00:52,493
Your wife's sweet for that.

607
01:00:52,991 --> 01:00:55,761
I'm definitely blessed
with the women in my life.

608
01:00:56,577 --> 01:00:57,577
Women?

609
01:00:57,944 --> 01:01:01,357
Yeah, women, my wife, my mom

610
01:01:02,222 --> 01:01:03,639
and my daughters.

611
01:01:03,968 --> 01:01:05,500
That young lady your daughter?

612
01:01:05,943 --> 01:01:07,441
Who Paige, she's my oldest.

613
01:01:08,901 --> 01:01:10,258
You got children?

614
01:01:10,392 --> 01:01:14,251
Yeah, two boys, six and eight.

615
01:01:14,783 --> 01:01:17,485
Six and eight, God's gift.

616
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:19,394
Sometimes.

617
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:25,463
Well, get some rest, if
you need anything ring me.

618
01:01:26,036 --> 01:01:27,045
I will.

619
01:01:27,095 --> 01:01:28,978
Hey, what's your name?

620
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:30,179
Joanie.

621
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,740
Joanie, okay, thanks Joanie.

622
01:01:37,825 --> 01:01:40,742
Oh my God if that old guy in 414

623
01:01:40,803 --> 01:01:44,222
complains about the food one more time,

624
01:01:44,668 --> 01:01:48,379
he's gonna have to like, clean
his own bed pan or something.

625
01:01:49,723 --> 01:01:51,887
Like, seriously, what's this guy think,

626
01:01:51,948 --> 01:01:53,599
Gordon Ramsey's the chef here?

627
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,827
I mean, hello, it's a hospital.

628
01:01:59,127 --> 01:02:01,301
You look different today.

629
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:04,833
Did the black hawk in 432
get transferred or something?

630
01:02:06,663 --> 01:02:09,558
No, it's incredible actually.

631
01:02:11,659 --> 01:02:12,659
What is?

632
01:02:15,181 --> 01:02:17,742
It's like, it's a whole different person

633
01:02:17,803 --> 01:02:18,967
from when he came in.

634
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:23,197
I mean, I guess that's common

635
01:02:23,258 --> 01:02:25,151
he's just been through
a traumatic experience.

636
01:02:27,224 --> 01:02:29,386
And that's the thing,

637
01:02:30,369 --> 01:02:32,156
even if they got all the cancer

638
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:35,620
and they don't know if they did,

639
01:02:36,942 --> 01:02:39,425
he could still be blind in his right eye.

640
01:02:40,578 --> 01:02:45,276
But yet, he's at peace with everything.

641
01:02:48,057 --> 01:02:49,807
It's kinda inspiring.

642
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:52,750
Yeah, I guess it is.

643
01:02:53,632 --> 01:02:56,182
I'm gonna go check on the old guy again.

644
01:03:01,315 --> 01:03:04,209
Day 11, in the
beginning was the word

645
01:03:04,259 --> 01:03:06,347
and the word was with God

646
01:03:06,938 --> 01:03:09,516
and the word was God.

647
01:03:22,828 --> 01:03:25,548
You already know
what the results will be.

648
01:03:28,063 --> 01:03:30,199
So, why the doctors
taking so long to tell me?

649
01:03:32,668 --> 01:03:36,122
Do you have any doubts?

650
01:03:42,128 --> 01:03:43,461
No, not at all.

651
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:49,658
Dr. Kirman, how long
you been standing there?

652
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:53,339
Not long, long enough.

653
01:03:55,155 --> 01:03:58,238
So, who were you talking to just now?

654
01:04:07,396 --> 01:04:09,809
Devin, I got some great news.

655
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:13,252
I am extremely happy
to be able to tell you

656
01:04:13,302 --> 01:04:18,694
there are no traces of cancer remaining.

657
01:04:20,715 --> 01:04:22,632
Devin, did you hear me?

658
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:30,561
We got it, all of it, you're cancer-free.

659
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,166
And my eye?

660
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:42,346
Let's take a look.

661
01:04:45,207 --> 01:04:47,220
All right, easy now,
there's gonna be a little tug.

662
01:04:48,627 --> 01:04:49,627
Okay, good.

663
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:21,656
I can see, I can see perfectly!

664
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,433
What are you doing?

665
01:05:43,063 --> 01:05:45,829
James, you know we don't
put our hands on other students.

666
01:05:46,767 --> 01:05:50,022
Steven, you're okay,
there's no need to cry,

667
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:51,745
we're gonna go to class in a minute.

668
01:05:53,334 --> 01:05:55,084
Oh, it never stops.

669
01:05:55,268 --> 01:05:57,446
Only at 3:30.

670
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:04,046
Did you see that your man crush is back?

671
01:06:05,943 --> 01:06:08,275
Rachel, you know I
don't have time for that.

672
01:06:08,325 --> 01:06:11,300
Yeah but that don't mean
you don't want none of that.

673
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,975
Stop.

674
01:06:14,025 --> 01:06:16,306
I bet you lunch, you won't walk past him

675
01:06:16,367 --> 01:06:17,836
and make eye contact.

676
01:06:17,886 --> 01:06:18,886
Lunch?

677
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,540
You're on.

678
01:06:23,389 --> 01:06:25,492
So, you're gonna come
by tomorrow and eat, right?

679
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:27,244
I guess, Mom, what ever you wanna do.

680
01:06:27,305 --> 01:06:28,706
- All right, sweetie.
- I gotta go right now.

681
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:29,839
- All right.
- I'll talk to you later.

682
01:06:29,863 --> 01:06:31,652
Hey, wait, wait, wait, there's
someone I want you to meet.

683
01:06:31,676 --> 01:06:32,676
Look good.

684
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,486
And I want a sub sandwich.

685
01:06:35,547 --> 01:06:36,797
Sub sandwich.

686
01:06:37,114 --> 01:06:38,148
Oh, come on Ma, listen,

687
01:06:38,198 --> 01:06:39,594
we've been through this already,

688
01:06:39,655 --> 01:06:41,559
you are not allowed to
set me up with anyone.

689
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,735
It's not a set up, I said meet.

690
01:06:44,915 --> 01:06:46,615
And trust me, you'll be happy

691
01:06:47,123 --> 01:06:49,151
and the rest will be up
to you, just meet her.

692
01:06:49,212 --> 01:06:50,438
Here she comes.

693
01:07:06,491 --> 01:07:08,709
Thank Jesus, thank you.

694
01:07:11,066 --> 01:07:14,812
Devin, look who here.

695
01:07:15,622 --> 01:07:17,122
I can see, babe.

696
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:21,316
Thank you, I can see.

697
01:07:50,035 --> 01:07:53,689
Hey, if it's not important
can I hit you back tomorrow.

698
01:07:54,242 --> 01:07:56,403
The court date
has been set, Devin,

699
01:07:56,464 --> 01:07:58,547
four weeks from tomorrow.

700
01:08:00,915 --> 01:08:04,511
Look, Devin, I'm sorry, I
know this isn't something

701
01:10:01,412 --> 01:10:05,410
Day 12, reflect on what I am saying

702
01:10:05,697 --> 01:10:08,326
for the Lord will give
you insight into all this.

703
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:46,260
All right, Devin, let's
take one more look

704
01:10:46,321 --> 01:10:48,571
at how you're healing here.

705
01:10:50,394 --> 01:10:52,061
Yeah, it looks good.

706
01:10:53,663 --> 01:10:59,207
Yeah, it is absolutely amazing
at how fast you've recovered.

707
01:11:01,769 --> 01:11:04,922
This had to be one of
the most difficult surgeries

708
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:08,595
we've done here and well,
for everything to go the way

709
01:11:08,715 --> 01:11:11,963
it has, it's incredible.

It's been a real honor to
see this through with you.

711
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:20,633
I know you have a strong belief in God

712
01:11:20,683 --> 01:11:24,964
and I know that this is not a coincidence.

713
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:32,441
Thanks doc but it's not
a belief, it's a relationship.

714
01:11:35,602 --> 01:11:37,065
People believe all the time,

715
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:41,302
only through a relationship,
you will be affected.
