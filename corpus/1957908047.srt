00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,791
Just go in and tell him.

2
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,086
Don't be stupid.

3
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,796
♪ Telling me to go there ♪

4
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,214
Just do it.

5
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,091
♪ I can see ♪

6
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,637
Otherwise, he's gonna get
married and that's it.

7
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,641
Why is this so hard?

8
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,480
Sluts.

9
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,777
♪ I only have to see you ♪

10
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,155
Girl, you got this.

11
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:15,701
Phones?

12
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,664
Excuse me, this is
a private event.

13
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,876
Is your name on the list?

14
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,167
I don't know.

15
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,919
- First name.
- Jennifer.

16
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,920
Last name.

17
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,173
Robinson.

18
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,173
Arms up, please.

19
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:32,843
Go ahead.

20
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,430
Phone.

21
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,849
What for?

22
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,227
This is a private event,
no cell phones, ma'am.

23
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,186
Oh, how do I get it back?

24
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,522
Take this ticket, when
you're ready to check out,

25
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,399
come see us.

26
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,483
You don't drop it, all right?

27
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,860
Okay, you have a good night.

28
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,572
Thanks.

29
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,548
Yeah.

30
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,674
And everyone else-

31
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,675
Can you imagine?

32
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,802
I hope everyone does.

33
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,761
- Oh, I do.
- Really?

34
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:00,637
Good.

35
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,515
Jenny.

36
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,018
No way.

37
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,902
I didn't think you'd come.

38
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,487
Well, you're getting married

39
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,905
and with as craziest
things have been

40
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,824
who knows when I'll
get to see you again.

41
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,743
Yeah, I know.

42
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,746
I mean, you know, it's been
busy since the merger and-

43
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:28,832
And you have another one
coming up tomorrow night.

44
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,586
Uh, yes, that is true.

45
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,879
Can I get two shots of whiskey?

46
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,506
Coming right up.

47
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,549
So with as busy as you have been

48
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,093
and as busy as I'm
sure you're gonna be,

49
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,972
what I might see once
every five years.

50
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,098
Who's counting right?

51
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,934
Um, that, right now, sure.

52
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,102
It seems that way.

53
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,938
But, um, listen, I'll make sure

54
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,941
that we get our
bestie time, okay?

55
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,817
Don't even worry.

56
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,110
Yeah.

57
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,069
Bestie time.

58
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:58,947
Yeah.

59
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,661
You know, you, you got my number

60
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:08,955
so you can always text me and
we'll just set something up.

61
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,207
Well, I did,
but you know, I, it was-

62
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,209
Wait, well, no, no, you haven't.

63
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,879
I mean, I, I've sent
you plenty of messages

64
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,173
and you basically
just ignored me.

65
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,676
I mean, I'm genuinely surprised
you even showed up tonight.

66
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,636
It's, it's crazy.

67
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,640
I mean, I, I figured
you were upset or,

68
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,850
well, by the way, I hoped
that you would come,

69
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,897
and I'm really
glad that you did.

70
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,777
Yeah, Aus, you, you
might wanna hold onto that.

71
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:44,076
Well, listen, let me start
out by saying I am upset.

72
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,661
About what?

73
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,622
It's not about you,
but it's about myself.

74
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,290
And I have been
for a long while.

75
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,922
And, and it's only because I
haven't spoken about it sooner.

76
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,633
It's pretty much the entire
reason I came here tonight.

77
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,096
Well, for how long?

78
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,014
As long as you've
been with Chelsi.

79
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,059
But I, I'd really
love to talk about it

80
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,978
if you care to listen.

81
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,896
Uh, of course, I'd like to.

82
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,733
I mean, wait, does this
have anything to do with-

83
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:20,110
There's that fucking twat.

84
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,112
Do you know how many
gorgeous tits I passed up

85
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,279
just to come find you?

86
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,698
Uh, three.

87
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,909
Is that Jennifer?

88
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:27,951
Hi, Angel.

89
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,204
Oh, hi, darling.

90
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,290
You always were hot,

91
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,376
but I don't remember
you being this hot.

92
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,795
Aussie, has she
always been this hot?

93
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,338
Hey, can we have this
conversations so I can go?

94
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,132
Do you still work at the club?

95
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,842
You know, the one
over on south side,

96
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:44,926
I forget the name of it.

97
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,762
Nope, I don't.

98
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:47,888
No.

99
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,139
Well, where do you work at now?

100
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,266
I'd love to come see you.

101
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,434
Tell you my secrets.

102
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,311
All my secrets.

103
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,982
Yeah, no I retired
five years ago, sweetie.

104
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,192
Oh, what a shame.

105
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,819
Well, good for you though

106
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,905
moving on up to bigger
and better things I see.

107
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:08,033
But tell me, what are
you doing these days?

108
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,161
Escorting, camming?

109
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,121
- Can we please?
- Yikes.

110
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,124
Yeah, sure.

111
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,083
Hey, Angel, could you
just hold down the bar

112
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,168
for us real quick?

113
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,044
Appreciate it.

114
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,420
Thank you.

115
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,048
Another please.

116
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,133
Yeah, I'm so
sorry about Angel, I-

117
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,426
I'm surprised you've put up

118
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,053
with her for this long.

119
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,513
I, I, I know how
she can get sometimes,

120
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,097
but, you know-

121
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,766
Dude, she's not
even your cup of tea.

122
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,059
- Wait!
- Well, I mean, you know,

123
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,310
she has her moments.
- Austin.

124
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,436
- Moments?
- Where do you think-

125
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,021
That's what you call them.

126
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,147
Where do you think you're going?

127
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,816
It's your bachelor party, mate.

128
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,317
I brought you all
these exotic dancers

129
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,985
and you're running off
with the retired one.

130
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,530
I get it, you two
have your history,

131
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:49,825
but the festivities
have just begun.

132
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:53,161
Right, well, um,
we're gonna step out

133
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,580
and just talk for a bit.

134
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:55,455
- No, no, no, no.
- I'll be right back.

135
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,582
No, no, no.

136
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,458
There's no time for that, love.

137
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,376
The party bus is scheduled
to arrive at midnight

138
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,003
so perhaps you two can take
your conversation on board.

139
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,506
I, I'm sorry, did
you say party bus?

140
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,968
I'm sorry, I, have we not
spent enough money already?

141
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,178
It's the last night
that you get to live

142
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,013
before becoming a eunuch.

143
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,558
There's no such thing as enough.

144
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,061
I think renting out an entire
club was definitely enough.

145
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,857
My dear friend, I
went all out for you,

146
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,067
so instead of bashing,
how about a thank you?

147
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,485
You know these kinds of shindigs

148
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,112
aren't exactly easy
to orchestrate.

149
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,572
No, no, it's not
that I'm not thankful,

150
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,574
it's, it's, you know,
I'm just saying,

151
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,408
you know, financially
speaking we're-

152
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,203
Love, love, love,
that's the problem.

153
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,664
You're thinking the way
you did before the merger,

154
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,169
but now you're a
multimillionaire, Aussie.

155
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,169
Not yet.

156
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,462
But you will be.

157
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,381
And that's a beautiful thing

158
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,425
because you earned it just
like you earned tonight.

159
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,427
You allowed this to happen.

160
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,096
- Yeah.
- I'm beginning

161
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,931
to feel disrespected.

162
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,976
Oh, feelings, I'm
surprised you're capable.

163
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,145
Can we please go
somewhere right now?

164
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,272
I'm not getting on
that damn trashy bus.

165
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,983
Oh, no, no, you're
gonna love it.

166
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,068
See, it has all the amenities
that you're familiar with

167
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,154
so I trust you'll
feel right at home.

168
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:13,992
I want to hit her right
now, and it's going to happen.

169
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,621
Oh my God, is that a party bus?

170
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,515
Holy shit.

171
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:41,019
Well, now it's not some
damn trashy bus now is it?

172
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,690
You're fucking welcome.

173
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,737
Come on, you eunuch,
and bring your pet.

174
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,282
You two can have your
chinwag on the bus.

175
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,493
I really hate her.

176
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,085
Um, I mean, I did
technically pay for it.

177
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,839
That's the sad part.

178
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,382
Do you want to go?

179
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,217
It would really mean a lot to me

180
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,471
if you're able to share
this night with me.

181
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:21,604
Promise me one thing,
if I get on that damn bus,

182
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,398
you allow me to have this
conversation with you.

183
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,235
I can do that.

184
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:42,247
Oh, bloody hell,
I'm chopped to bits.

185
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,666
Go on show us your white bits.

186
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,919
If I may, if I may, with
the best of my abilities,

187
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,005
I have a few words that I would
love to share with you all

188
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:41,051
about our dear boy who is
about to take the plunge.

189
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,679
I've known this good
cunt for a million years

190
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:45,849
or like would you say 12?

191
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,517
Something like that.

192
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,188
More than one, but
less than two many.

193
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,856
Do you remember how I met you?

194
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,109
Yeah, uh, I've been
trying to forget.

195
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,736
Well, if you did,

196
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,739
I'm absolutely sure
Jennifer did not.

197
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,658
Fuck off.

198
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,664
You two were studying and
I was just an innocent girl,

199
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,915
new to the freedom
of the American way,

200
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,126
but what I learned in that
moment was that Austin

201
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,171
really isn't the kind
of guy to say no.

202
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,925
He is a generous giver though.

203
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,760
In fact, some of
his worst hangovers

204
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:24,970
and most questionable decisions

205
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,890
I proudly take credit for.

206
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,935
But in all seriousness,

207
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,645
Aussie has always
been there for others.

208
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,607
And I'm sure we all
have a story to share.

209
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:39,192
We are celebrating
the death and rebirth

210
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:42,698
of our incredible friend,
boss, and brother.

211
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,825
Now, I am aware that we all
have our memorable stories,

212
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,284
and though they do
differ from one another,

213
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,162
they all have him as
the common thread.

214
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,334
So let's go around and
show our appreciation.

215
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,168
Tony, kick us off.

216
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,879
Oh, shit it's like that, huh?

217
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:00,841
All right, all right.

218
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,009
Where to start?

219
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,136
Uh, I mean, there's many
things I could speak on,

220
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:10,181
but the one that
probably means the most

221
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,687
is the opportunity
Austin gave me.

222
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,231
For about a year I was his
boss until he left the company.

223
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,943
And like three years
later, I was laid off.

224
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,488
Spent about nine years there,
three after Austin left.

225
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,742
And we never really knew
each other that well.

226
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,121
But when I interviewed
at his company

227
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,081
without hesitation he
offered me the CPA position

228
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:40,086
and it, it saved me in more
ways that I could even speak of.

229
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,008
So tonight I toast to you.

230
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,300
You deserve the best.

231
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,927
Oh, he absolutely does.

232
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,429
And how lucky are we
all with that merger?

233
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,973
Oh, the future was very
brilliant for us all.

234
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,060
Very promising.

235
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,101
- Yeah.
- Well, I think we all

236
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:55,936
deserve a raise.

237
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:57,938
Yeah, I'll check the budget.

238
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,275
Shandon.

239
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,193
As some of you know,

240
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,278
Jackie and I have been trying
for some time to get pregnant,

241
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
and it's been impossible.

242
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,992
We've been going broke, trying
everything under the sun,

243
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:11,954
including IVF.

244
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:17,999
We've tried so many second
chances and we almost lost hope.

245
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,877
But then we learned of the
state-of-the-art process

246
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,258
that was very promising, but
completely out of our budget.

247
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,511
I know Austin pays us
well, but not well enough

248
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:32,182
to afford a half a
million dollar procedure.

249
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,017
I remember I was so nervous

250
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,271
walking into his office
asking him for help.

251
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,522
But you know what?

252
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,067
I'm glad I did.

253
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,279
Thank you, Austin.

254
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,036
Sweetie, you could
have just fucked him.

255
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,079
Aus, I'm really surprised

256
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,916
you've stayed friends
with this one for so long.

257
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,251
I, how you doing?

258
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:04,254
Uh, I, uh, actually,
believe it or not,

259
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,256
she's one of the better ones.

260
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,674
I'm the best bitch.

261
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,134
I'm sorry you didn't
get the gig, sweetheart,

262
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,052
but consistency is key.

263
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,139
Well, things change.

264
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:16,474
Perhaps, but with what
I've pulled off tonight,

265
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,059
I've earned it.

266
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,436
Oh, spending
somebody else's money

267
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,106
to throw them a bachelor party.

268
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,357
You sure did, sweetie.

269
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,526
Oh, thank you.

270
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:27,402
And on top of that,

271
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,657
I have a very special surprise
for our man Aussie here.

272
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,742
Remember when you asked
me to be your best woman?

273
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,704
Uh, yes, I do.

274
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,999
I wasn't the first choice.

275
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,333
Who did you tell me
was the first choice?

276
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:46,296
Um, my brother.

277
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:49,758
And when was the last
time you heard from him?

278
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,765
Uh, it's been about
15, 16 years ago.

279
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,475
Right before he went to prison.

280
00:16:58,644 --> 00:16:59,768
Right.

281
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,396
16 years.

282
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,690
Well, safe to say, it's
been a long time coming,

283
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:09,530
but I'm honored to
say I found him.

284
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:12,783
Are you high?

285
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,659
Wait, wait, what?

286
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,744
I mean, I'm sorry,
what do you mean?

287
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,457
I know I sound ridiculous,
but that is who I am.

288
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:26,461
Aussie, you are my best friend
and I consider you a brother.

289
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:29,673
But knowing what I know,
I will happily stand down

290
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,760
so that your brother
can be your best man.

291
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,136
You've gotta be
kidding right now, right?

292
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,597
You're way too fucked up.

293
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,599
This is, can't be joked about.

294
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,767
I'm sorry, are
are you being serious?

295
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,104
I promised you this would
be a night to remember.

296
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,396
I love you, mate.

297
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,439
Hey, Aus.

298
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:54,239
It's been a long time, brother.

299
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:59,204
What?

300
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,642
You're really here.

301
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,392
I am.

302
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:26,522
I'm sorry, I, I just,
this is blowing my mind.

303
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:29,608
I, I, I can't believe it.

304
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,734
Believe it.

305
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,569
Angel told me all about you.

306
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:36,241
I'm so proud of your success.

307
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,415
I, I, I tried to
contact you so many times.

308
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,456
I know you did.

309
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,833
I got every letter you sent.

310
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,586
I couldn't, I couldn't
write you back,

311
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:50,964
I was too embarrassed.

312
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:53,799
I just want you to know

313
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:57,805
that I never met to leave
you and Mom in the dark.

314
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,891
I just had to forgive myself

315
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,602
before I could ask
anybody else to.

316
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,478
You know, I promised her,

317
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,650
I promised her that I
would look out for you

318
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:11,944
and I fucked that up.

319
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,446
But I know I had a lot of people

320
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,825
in my life I didn't deserve.

321
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,579
I, I, I get that now.

322
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:29,461
You know, when Mom
passed, I, I was so lost.

323
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,804
And I'm just lucky that
John and Monica took me in.

324
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,851
I wasn't in the
most healthy place.

325
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,855
I went through a lot
of, a lot of dark shit

326
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,066
and I had to be by
myself for a while.

327
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,030
I'm just glad that
you found good people

328
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,533
to have in your corner.

329
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,036
There's just so much that,

330
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,913
that I wanna talk to you about.

331
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,750
I know, I know, but we have
all the time in the world,

332
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:12,669
and we're gonna
need it to catch up.

333
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,634
Tonight, tonight is about
celebrating with you.

334
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:22,095
So let's put this
conversation on park,

335
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,930
get back to the party.

336
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,641
- Yeah.
- Yes, mates, let's resume.

337
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:27,561
He's not the bus
driver then who is?

338
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,896
My buddy Felix is.

339
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,106
See, it's autonomous.

340
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,107
Autonomous?

341
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,776
Self-driving.

342
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:37,485
That's a thing.

343
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,488
Well, not yet, but
it will be eventually.

344
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,784
This is the first
of three prototypes.

345
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:45,579
You can control it
with a phone or.

346
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:56,046
Pretty cool stuff, huh?

347
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,673
Impressive.

348
00:20:57,675 --> 00:21:00,216
It will be once we
work out all the bugs.

349
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:01,094
Bugs?

350
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
It has a mind of
its own sometimes.

351
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:06,682
Is it safe now?

352
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:08,852
I would say
safe is a relative term.

353
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:13,146
Holy fuck, man, you had
me going there for a second.

354
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,192
I had you going for
more than a second.

355
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,901
Look at this guy over here,

356
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,071
he looks like he's
shitting bricks.

357
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:21,321
You all right, buddy?

358
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:23,576
You're kind of sweating there.

359
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:31,081
So I take it you're the
one with the booger sugar.

360
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,833
That would be him.

361
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:34,250
Can I taste?

362
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,336
Yeah, man.

363
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,921
You?

364
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,715
No, I don't, but you can.

365
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:41,925
It's totally fine with me.

366
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,095
I can appreciate that.

367
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:55,941
Is it good?

368
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,110
Yeah.

369
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,193
It's fire.

370
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:01,989
I only sell the best.

371
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,199
How is it?

372
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:11,162
- Pretty good.
- Damn right it's good.

373
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,125
But I can get better.

374
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,669
This is the best
you're gonna get.

375
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,005
Your brother's a bit
of a cock isn't he?

376
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,757
I like him.

377
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,426
Of course you would.

378
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:28,390
Ooh.

379
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,933
What do you got there?

380
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,146
This will blow your mind.

381
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:39,900
Next time you need a
bump get it off of that.

382
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:40,986
I got plenty.

383
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,923
Babe, are you good?

384
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,930
I think Angel
had the right idea.

385
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,931
Let's get back into
that conversation,

386
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,935
only this time let's be
a little more honest.

387
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,436
Honest?

388
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:17,938
Yeah, you know, not
bullshitting, not telling lies.

389
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,192
Honesty, just honesty.

390
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:25,405
I mean, I, I think
everyone was being honest.

391
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:27,407
Sure.

392
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,325
Why do you say that?

393
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,326
I don't know, maybe
it's the way you're talking.

394
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,244
Maybe it's your tone.

395
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,914
Maybe you're high and
your interpretation is shit.

396
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,373
Maybe.

397
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,586
What do you think, Angel?

398
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,587
You think Tony's right?

399
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,004
I know I'm right.

400
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,173
It's difficult to say.

401
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,092
I'm having trouble understanding

402
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,969
where you're going
with all this.

403
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:50,345
It's difficult.

404
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,222
It's all difficult.

405
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:55,183
All of you are difficult,
but the truth is simple.

406
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,434
Lies are complex.

407
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,979
Try, try not to hurt yourselves

408
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:00,564
thinking about that too hard.

409
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,190
Geez, get to the point.

410
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,067
He just fucking with us, Tony.

411
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,069
I'll second that.

412
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:09,239
The games we play,
especially this one.

413
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,950
I'm very amused by all this.

414
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,409
Good.

415
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,036
And I hope you can
keep that energy up

416
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,162
because I have a
proposal to make.

417
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,458
You will have two options.

418
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:24,214
You can either speak the
truth or I'll kill you.

419
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,260
Oh, what the
fuck dude, that's messed up.

420
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,220
If your brother doesn't
stop fucking with us,

421
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,599
I'm gonna go into labor.

422
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:39,435
Yeah, Sean, come on, let's
just, uh, keep it light.

423
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,105
Yeah, this is starting
to get really weird.

424
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,525
You seem to always
have a lot to say.

425
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:46,067
No, but apparently you do.

426
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,110
No, it's not about me.

427
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,570
It's about all of you.

428
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,739
It's about my brother.

429
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:54,492
Why don't you just sit down
and let the snow settle, mate?

430
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,995
Sure, after we
all speak the truth.

431
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:59,041
Dude, you are fucking high.

432
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,592
Oh, this is gonna
be a long night.

433
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:17,140
Hey, Sean, um, tell
me what the joke is.

434
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:19,643
I mean, what's this all about?

435
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,269
Yeah.

436
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,354
Prison gave me a very
specific sense of humor.

437
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,317
Just know that this
is all intentional

438
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:30,447
and in the end it'll
all make sense.

439
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,156
What will?

440
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,533
Everything.

441
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:36,829
I just need you to trust me.

442
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:42,082
I, I'm starting to think I
don't even know you anymore.

443
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:44,250
Now see, that's the
thing you need to ask yourself.

444
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:46,630
You need to ask yourself,
do you know you?

445
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:50,591
I'm not feeling this anymore.

446
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:52,258
I just wanna go home.

447
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,346
Yeah, that sounds
like a solid idea.

448
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:03,105
Felix, take us home.

449
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,233
All right, we're
heading back now.

450
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,109
Your brother is
seriously lost the plot.

451
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:11,277
He's gone and spun
out of works, Aussie.

452
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,114
Fuck.

453
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,200
Shandon.

454
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,786
That's my name.

455
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:23,416
Do you know what
section you're sitting in?

456
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,586
No.

457
00:26:31,634 --> 00:26:33,258
The C section.

458
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:35,719
Oh, what the what?

459
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:40,306
Fuck!

460
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:44,352
Oh, my God!

461
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,487
Fucking seriously!

462
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,326
No!

463
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,037
Oh God why?

464
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:44,790
Why?

465
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:51,547
No!

466
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:04,057
Oh, my god!

467
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:07,060
Uh, you, uh, you
guys thought I was, uh,

468
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:07,938
you guys thought I was playing.

469
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,439
What the fuck, man?

470
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:18,154
Is everyone taking
me seriously now?

471
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:20,031
She's fucking choking.

472
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,533
Yeah, that's the idea.

473
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:22,784
Sean, what are you doing?

474
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,160
She's dying.

475
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:25,581
What am I doing?

476
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:31,754
Fuck.

477
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,100
Jesus, that bitch won't die.

478
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:57,736
Oh, my god, get the fuck off me.

479
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,823
Shut the fuck up.

480
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:03,074
Now look, Austin, I'm sorry

481
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:06,161
I did this on such
an important night,

482
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:08,081
but I made you and Ma a promise.

483
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,041
As for the rest of you,

484
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:15,673
each and every one of you
earned your seat on this bus.

485
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,590
Now, the rules are simple.

486
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:21,554
You either speak the truth
or I burn you with it.

487
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,974
Now, we don't have
a lot of time.

488
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:29,976
I have a schedule to keep.

489
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:32,022
So if any of you
try anything brave,

490
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:37,150
just remember you're gonna
lose your opportunity to speak.

491
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:41,156
This, this is not a safe place.

492
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:46,326
I hope you can comprehend that.

493
00:29:57,798 --> 00:29:59,881
That's my least favorite part.

494
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:00,759
Sean!

495
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,680
What the hell happened to you?

496
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:06,640
Nothing.

497
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:08,890
I'm just keeping a promise.

498
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:09,891
A promise?

499
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,768
What fucking promise?

500
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,313
You're not well, man.

501
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:17,860
Yeah, we know that.

502
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:19,862
I never have been.

503
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,699
But you know you know,
it's all about love.

504
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:27,909
Hey, Felix.

505
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,120
Let's go home.

506
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,145
Aus, Aus.

507
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,438
We need to get outta here.

508
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,857
Aus.
- If you can't tell,

509
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:00,025
he's clearly not okay

510
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:01,278
and this whole thing is fucked.

511
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:04,905
We need to rush him.

512
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:06,239
Bullshit.

513
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:07,198
And the gun?

514
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,324
And?

515
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:10,076
And fuck that.

516
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,494
We have to try something.

517
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:13,496
It's obvious this
guy us fucking nuts.

518
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:16,124
If we just sit here we
guarantee his promise.

519
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:17,501
I'm with Jennifer on this.

520
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:19,085
So am I.

521
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:22,881
Okay, I see you're
all fucking mad.

522
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:24,007
And me?

523
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,258
No, I'll take my chances.

524
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,761
You are such a fucking coward.

525
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:28,430
What's that?

526
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:33,391
What are you guys doing in
that little huddle back there?

527
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:34,978
Trading secrets?

528
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:39,147
Aus, Aus, you know, your friends

529
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:43,070
are really good at
keeping secrets.

530
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:46,279
Don't worry, we'll be
on the highway soon.

531
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,488
What about your husband?

532
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,949
What about 'em?

533
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:50,033
Can we use him?

534
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,492
Not in that condition.

535
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,494
I don't think he
knows where he is.

536
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,371
Can you wake him up?

537
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:57,498
A big guy like that could
really do some damage.

538
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,417
Yeah, if we could wake
him up with the four of us,

539
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,294
I think we can do it.

540
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:03,171
Did you all wake up this
morning and think you,

541
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,173
yay, this is a great day
to fucking commit suicide?

542
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:06,508
Well, it was great
knowing all of you.

543
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:11,054
I love that we're
all getting along.

544
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:13,431
What the fuck?

545
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,851
You wanna act like a bitch,
I'll treat you like one.

546
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:16,518
You know what?

547
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,853
Fuck all of you.

548
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:19,354
You're telling me our only hope

549
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:20,230
is just to casually rush
him, hope for the best.

550
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:21,356
Shut up.

551
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,524
Is there any other option?

552
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:26,152
There's always another option.

553
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,904
Oh, shit, from what
we've witnessed tonight,

554
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,948
I'm convinced we only get one.

555
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,657
She's right.

556
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:31,619
You know she is.

557
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,204
We need to stick together.

558
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,211
Yo, we need your fucking help.

559
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:46,422
All right, we just need
to try to wake him up.

560
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:48,299
Yeah, can you do it?

561
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:49,425
I can try.

562
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:50,969
It just depends on what he's on.

563
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:52,264
Do you know what he's on?

564
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:55,601
Everything.

565
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:58,604
Don't worry, I got this.

566
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,442
I wouldn't do anything stupid.

567
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,153
Neither would I.

568
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10,155
I just wanna sit
next to my husband.

569
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:11,199
Or is that not okay?

570
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:13,992
I don't care what
the fuck you do.

571
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,203
Just don't be stupid.

572
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:32,638
John.

573
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:35,473
John, baby.

574
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,727
John, baby, I need
you to wake up for me.

575
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:45,442
John.

576
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:52,531
Oh my God.

577
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,740
Johnny.

578
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:55,075
Come on, Johnny.

579
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:55,826
Come on, Johnny.

580
00:33:55,828 --> 00:33:57,327
Wake up, baby.

581
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:58,494
Come on.

582
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:00,163
Come on.

583
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:01,164
Please, baby, wake
up for me, please.

584
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:01,834
Please, baby, come on.

585
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:06,419
I don't know what
I think about this.

586
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:09,840
Aus, what sort of company
are you running here?

587
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:12,258
What is this some sort
of voyeurism group?

588
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,134
Please, baby.

589
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:14,344
Come on, yeah.

590
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,222
Aus.

591
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,598
You can't answer me.

592
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,601
You can't fucking answer me.

593
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:22,312
Come on.

594
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:24,688
No.

595
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,566
No?

596
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,316
After all this time,

597
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:30,151
building up this big
successful business,

598
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,153
and you still can't speak up.

599
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,155
Speak the fuck up, bro.

600
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:35,741
Say it from your chest.

601
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:36,577
More.

602
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:40,161
No.

603
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,331
No, what?

604
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:47,671
No, we're not some
voyeurism group.

605
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,549
Ah, that's terrible.

606
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,175
We need to work on
your vocal presence.

607
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:56,514
Come on, baby,
please wake up for me.

608
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:06,314
She would be disappointed
with who you've become.

609
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:09,192
I haven't changed.

610
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:12,487
What do you think I
went to prison for?

611
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:16,324
She would always tell me about

612
00:35:17,535 --> 00:35:18,952
how she wished you'd come home

613
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:21,703
and that you changed your ways.

614
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:22,704
Okay.

615
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:24,581
All right, here you go.

616
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,794
I'm glad she's not
here to learn the truth.

617
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:31,256
Aus, there is
so much you don't know.

618
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:34,299
Depends on how far
we get tonight.

619
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,804
I'll, I'll talk to you about it.

620
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:40,432
There's nothing to talk about.

621
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:43,934
I would have to disagree,

622
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:45,936
but for the sake of argument,

623
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:48,649
just know that you
don't know what I know.

624
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,860
And if you knew what I
knew, then you'd know.

625
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:56,613
Okay, all right, here you go.

626
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:58,323
All right, when you
take this hit, baby,

627
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:00,450
I need you to go fuck up
the driver for me, okay?

628
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:01,702
I need you to fuck
with the driver for me.

629
00:36:01,704 --> 00:36:03,537
- Why?
- Can you do that?

630
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:04,913
Because he told us we
don't deserve our children.

631
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:05,997
Can you do that for me?

632
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,708
Come on, come on, baby.

633
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,334
That motherfucker
said that shit?

634
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:10,669
Yeah, baby, he did, he did.

635
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:12,003
You bitch ass motherfucker!

636
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,672
Come on, come on.

637
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:15,006
Can't help but thank you guys.

638
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,695
What the fuck is so funny?

639
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,572
Oh, I told him
it'd blow his mind.

640
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:41,157
Dude, you are seriously
fucked in the head.

641
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,492
You know, it's all right though.

642
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:44,997
We are now back on the highway,

643
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,832
which means we can get back
to the intent of tonight.

644
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:49,958
Uh, we have what?

645
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,171
We have 40, 45 minutes to go.

646
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:55,881
Now excluding my brother

647
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,966
and whoever that is on
the floor back there,

648
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:02,428
we all need to have a very
important conversation.

649
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:06,432
So let's everybody gather
around in a little circle

650
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:08,476
and you know, we're
all friends here.

651
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:09,938
Let's, let's talk.

652
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:12,523
No.

653
00:37:12,525 --> 00:37:13,191
No?

654
00:37:14,777 --> 00:37:16,902
You're not gonna hurt my friend.

655
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,153
Well, I'd say it's a little late

656
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:20,155
for that now, wouldn't you?

657
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:21,907
No, it's not.

658
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:23,825
Yes, it is.

659
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:27,954
You know, Austin, you could
have pulled this hero act

660
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:30,541
about 16 years ago,

661
00:37:30,543 --> 00:37:33,585
but it's okay, tonight
you're gonna grow a backbone.

662
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:36,171
You're gonna learn how
to defend yourself.

663
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:38,256
Your friends, I don't
care what happens to them.

664
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:40,008
It's all up to them.

665
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,679
Enough is enough.

666
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:44,848
You piece of shit.

667
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:48,852
I knew you knew.

668
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,853
John knew you knew.

669
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:52,815
Why else?

670
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,652
You set us up.

671
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:00,612
You set us all up.

672
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:04,866
No, Monica, I, I would
never hurt you, any of you.

673
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:09,746
I, you, you and John
were there for me when,

674
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:14,753
when my mom passed and,
and he, and he wasn't.

675
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:17,588
I don't believe this.

676
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,965
And, and I'm
right here with you.

677
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:23,929
I trying to figure out how,
how we got into the situation.

678
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:32,688
And I'm not scared of
my brother anymore.

679
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:35,899
You were scared of me?

680
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:38,151
I don't believe this.

681
00:38:39,737 --> 00:38:40,779
Was this the only
option, Austin?

682
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:43,196
Now he had nothing
to do with this.

683
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:46,157
This is about you guys.

684
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:49,663
I know I do, but I can play too.

685
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:51,747
I can get really violent.

686
00:38:51,749 --> 00:38:52,748
Oh, I know you can.

687
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,666
I've read all about you.

688
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:56,918
That's why you and him have
special seats on this bus.

689
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,673
Just remember, you can
always speak the truth.

690
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:02,676
He already knows.

691
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:05,677
And I don't give a fuck anymore!

692
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,429
He doesn't, that's
the whole point of this.

693
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,306
You guys have to tell him.

694
00:39:10,308 --> 00:39:12,100
Save me the embarrassment.

695
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,813
Wait, what am I missing?

696
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:17,063
Cut the shit.

697
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:18,857
Fuck both of you!

698
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,411
Get off me you crazy bitch.

699
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:32,746
You want violence?

700
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:34,082
I'll give you violence, baby.

701
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:42,881
Oh, fuck.

702
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:44,257
What did I say?

703
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:45,260
No stupid.

704
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:48,970
Are you doing something stupid?

705
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:50,430
No.

706
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:51,932
Are you telling me the truth?

707
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:52,810
Yes.

708
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,103
We're on the honor system here.

709
00:39:57,105 --> 00:40:00,982
There's been some very serious
questions raised tonight.

710
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:03,359
Just keep in mind, you're
gonna have one opportunity.

711
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:04,903
Are you on some dumb shit?

712
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:07,447
No, I'm telling the truth.

713
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:09,324
No dumb shit.

714
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:12,329
What are you doing at
the front of the bus?

715
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:15,123
Answer the fucking question!

716
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:17,167
I'm sorry.

717
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:20,337
I'm scared to answer.

718
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:25,133
I moved because I didn't
wanna get hurt in the fight.

719
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:29,012
And I am where I'm at because
the bus stopped suddenly.

720
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:32,432
Please, that's the honest truth.

721
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:36,895
No, you're lying to me.

722
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,856
No, I'm not Sean, please.

723
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:41,525
Sean.

724
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:44,361
She's telling the truth.

725
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:49,617
Now you're lying to me.

726
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:56,329
Look, I might not know
whatever it is that you know,

727
00:40:56,331 --> 00:41:01,336
but, but I know her and,
and she isn't lying.

728
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:08,341
You know, that's,
that's incredible.

729
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:13,179
Here I was watching
her eyes dilate,

730
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:15,223
seeing her posture change,

731
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,518
listening to her
breath grow shallow,

732
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,436
what would I know?

733
00:41:20,313 --> 00:41:21,940
I don't care what you know.

734
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:24,484
I, I want nothing
to do with you.

735
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:30,446
You know, Monica said,
we're all on the same team.

736
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:32,367
I like what I'm seeing.

737
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:36,494
I think we're all heading
in the right direction.

738
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:37,330
Thank you.

739
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:43,003
Now everyone, let's come forward

740
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:48,676
so that we can finally end this.

741
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,082
Each and every one of
you are here tonight

742
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:23,834
because in some
which way or another,

743
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:27,422
you either took advantage
of or betrayed my brother.

744
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:33,512
Now that is the truth we
are going to speak on.

745
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:38,100
Angel, let's start with you.

746
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,267
Felix, lights.

747
00:42:43,606 --> 00:42:44,481
Right.

748
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:46,525
Me.

749
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,736
Go on.

750
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:51,113
Show us your white bits.

751
00:42:53,616 --> 00:42:54,491
My white bits.

752
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:02,415
Well, first I'd like to
begin with a sincere apology.

753
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:07,293
If it wasn't for my ambition
to always go above and beyond,

754
00:43:07,295 --> 00:43:09,507
I feel tonight would've
gone much differently.

755
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:16,847
Sean is asking for
truth, so I highly recommend

756
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:19,725
that each and every one
of you follow my lead.

757
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:26,189
Aussie, I've always loved you.

758
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:29,608
And I called you a brother

759
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,277
because you are the closest
that I've ever had to one.

760
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:33,947
I know you feel
the same about me,

761
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,910
and I would never
take advantage of you.

762
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:42,748
But I can't say the same about
everyone else on this bus.

763
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:47,586
And those at the club,
they were the lucky ones.

764
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,381
Well, technically no, but go on.

765
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:54,550
Why you say such
a trivial thing?

766
00:43:54,552 --> 00:43:56,510
Everyone had the
same opportunity.

767
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:57,596
What are you saying?

768
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:01,850
Monica, you seem like
a very smart woman.

769
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:04,309
Are they others like this?

770
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,352
Not like this, no.

771
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:09,815
But it was a similar
situation at the club.

772
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:10,693
The club?

773
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,901
All of them?

774
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:13,902
Yes.

775
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:15,737
Those were innocence.

776
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,614
My sisters were at that party.

777
00:44:17,616 --> 00:44:20,744
Well, in all fairness, you
should have seen this coming.

778
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:27,415
I'm not proud of what I've done,
but, uh, it had to be done.

779
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:29,543
Those are my
fucking baby sisters.

780
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:34,548
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Monica.

781
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,841
Monica, stop please.

782
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:37,720
Monica, please stop.

783
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:39,761
Please.

784
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:40,637
Defend yourself.

785
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:41,348
No.

786
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:43,849
No, Monica!

787
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,058
Get off me, please!
- Hit that fucking bitch.

788
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,392
- Please!
- Hit her.

789
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:47,686
Monica.

790
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:48,979
Oh, fuck me.

791
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:07,539
Chill, bitch!

792
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,540
You at this coming.

793
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:09,541
Fuck you!

794
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:10,667
Fuck all of you!

795
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:11,752
What a good little girl.

796
00:45:11,754 --> 00:45:13,419
You dick!

797
00:45:13,421 --> 00:45:14,671
I've never seen this
side of you before.

798
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:15,881
Don't play stupid.

799
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:17,048
Sean, what's going on?

800
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,134
I, I, I need some context here.

801
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:20,927
Well, that's what
this night is all about,

802
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:22,097
bringing out the truth!

803
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:26,057
Fuck you, fuck you!

804
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,601
Fuck you guys.

805
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:28,727
Fuck all of you!

806
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,145
Aus!

807
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:31,980
Fuck you.

808
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:32,858
You're up.

809
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:34,985
Take the goddamn knife.

810
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:38,779
What are you giving me this for?

811
00:45:38,781 --> 00:45:41,907
Because I want you to use
it while I hold her down.

812
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,575
Use it for what?

813
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:45,493
What have I been
doing all night?

814
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:48,498
I want you to use it to cut
the bitch's fucking head off!

815
00:45:50,668 --> 00:45:51,501
No.

816
00:45:52,545 --> 00:45:53,211
No!

817
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:55,088
Oh, good.

818
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:45,723
Fuck, fuck.

819
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:26,261
All right.

820
00:47:26,263 --> 00:47:28,263
Now this is not
going to go the way

821
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:33,059
you're imagining it in your
minds, so don't be stupid.

822
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:34,895
In case you haven't noticed,

823
00:47:34,897 --> 00:47:38,400
this bus is constructed
to keep people inside.

824
00:47:39,777 --> 00:47:41,860
Soundproof, bulletproofed,

825
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:45,822
and wired with enough explosives
to blow all you sky high.

826
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:48,909
Now, I don't want to hurt
anybody on the outside.

827
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:51,953
What you guys need to know
right now is a simple term,

828
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:54,332
collateral fucking damage.

829
00:47:55,834 --> 00:48:00,839
Now, don't fuck with your lives.

830
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:03,008
We're fucked either way.

831
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:05,341
Help!

832
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:09,807
I did say soundproofed, right?

833
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:16,186
All right, everybody
head this way.

834
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:17,813
Hello.

835
00:48:17,815 --> 00:48:19,773
My name is Officer
Audrey Lambmask

836
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:22,275
with the State Highway Police.

837
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:23,944
If you can hear me,

838
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:25,447
I need you to come to
the front of the bus.

839
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:39,044
All right no dumb shit.

840
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:42,170
Oh my God.

841
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:44,091
Oh, fuck.

842
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:46,510
Oh, fuck.

843
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,892
Sir, I need you
to step off the bus.

844
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:57,896
Are you deaf or hard of hearing?

845
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:00,899
I know a little bit
of sign language.

846
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:08,365
I need you to step
outside so we can talk.

847
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:11,199
Yes.

848
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,620
Talk about the bus.

849
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:46,444
My name is Officer Lambmask.

850
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:50,030
I'm not deaf.

851
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:54,159
Uh, I have a condition
with my ears.

852
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,994
Is something I
can help you with?

853
00:49:58,331 --> 00:50:00,165
Yes, first I need your papers.

854
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:02,668
Then we need to go
back to the cruiser.

855
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,546
Why?

856
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:07,215
It's too dangerous to be
this close to the highway, sir.

857
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,636
Okay.

858
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,056
Thank you.

859
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:21,227
No, no, hey, hey, hey, wait.

860
00:50:21,229 --> 00:50:23,063
We need your fucking help.

861
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:25,774
Angel, get your girl.

862
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:27,110
Oh, fuck me.

863
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:31,697
Help, we need some fucking help!

864
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:33,031
No wait, come back!

865
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:34,199
We need your fucking help!

866
00:50:34,201 --> 00:50:35,075
Come back.

867
00:50:35,077 --> 00:50:36,076
What the fuck?

868
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:37,118
We need your help.

869
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,078
Come back.

870
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,788
Hey, hey, hey!

871
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,707
Stephanie!

872
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:42,833
You stay the
fuck back you piece of shit.

873
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:45,251
Love, I need you to calm down.

874
00:50:45,253 --> 00:50:47,546
That man out there,
Sean, he is not well.

875
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:49,339
He did all of this.

876
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:51,758
I don't know a fucking Sean.

877
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,426
Let me off this fucking bus.

878
00:50:53,428 --> 00:50:54,427
I can't.

879
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:55,554
I don't know how.

880
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:56,680
You're lying.

881
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:57,806
I don't fucking trust you.

882
00:50:57,808 --> 00:50:59,140
I am not lying.

883
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:00,475
You know what?

884
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:02,102
I'll fucking stab you.
- Fine, fine.

885
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:03,103
Fuck you, fuck this,
fuck all of you.

886
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:04,565
She is not listening.

887
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:08,483
Chill out, okay?

888
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:09,860
You need to calm the hell down.

889
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:11,737
You need to join us in the back

890
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:13,446
so we can figure out how
to get the fuck outta here.

891
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:15,323
'Cause that crazy
fucker out there

892
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:17,367
is gonna come back here and
find a reason to kill you.

893
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:19,244
And I'm not planning to
stick around for that.

894
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:21,412
So the decision's up to you.

895
00:51:21,414 --> 00:51:22,290
Let's go.

896
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:31,592
Dude, how's a leg?

897
00:51:33,426 --> 00:51:35,888
It went clean through, but
I can't stop the bleeding.

898
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:40,559
Angel, give him your jacket.

899
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:43,476
Fuck off.

900
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:46,187
Use one off the dead
or use one of your own.

901
00:51:46,189 --> 00:51:47,606
I'm not gonna help somebody

902
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:49,359
who got themself in
a shit situation.

903
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:53,614
Sweetie, we're all
in this situation.

904
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:59,951
Well, some of us aren't
breathing or bleeding.

905
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:02,746
Oh my gosh, you're
fucking disgusting.

906
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:04,625
We all have
our days, sweetheart.

907
00:52:06,544 --> 00:52:08,001
I don't
understand what's going on.

908
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:09,878
Welcome back to the party.

909
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,839
None of us do.

910
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:14,550
What happened to
all these people?

911
00:52:14,552 --> 00:52:16,426
What happened to him?

912
00:52:16,428 --> 00:52:21,433
Well, he got shot and the
rest of them some other stuff.

913
00:52:24,562 --> 00:52:25,688
Who did all of this?

914
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:30,275
Aussie's dear brother Sean.

915
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,778
This is so fucked.

916
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:34,863
You've got that right.

917
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:38,701
I'm sorry guys.

918
00:52:40,703 --> 00:52:41,579
You're sorry.

919
00:52:43,496 --> 00:52:46,582
Is is that gonna
do anything sorrys?

920
00:52:46,584 --> 00:52:47,999
No, no, it's not.

921
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:50,376
Sorry isn't gonna
undo any of this shit.

922
00:52:50,378 --> 00:52:52,504
Instead of sitting
there feeling sorry,

923
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:54,506
you should do something.

924
00:52:54,508 --> 00:52:55,632
Like what?

925
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:57,008
What would you want me to do?

926
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,844
Well, it's pretty
fucking obvious.

927
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:00,846
I mean, your brother's
not gonna hurt you,

928
00:53:00,848 --> 00:53:02,806
so you should be
the one to stop him.

929
00:53:02,808 --> 00:53:05,475
He comes back in,
you two get into it,

930
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:08,019
and then we'll get out
and, and then get help.

931
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:10,522
And in the case
that we're wrong,

932
00:53:10,524 --> 00:53:12,440
your death wouldn't be in vain.

933
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:15,445
He's he's quite a point.

934
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,406
No, that is a terrible idea.

935
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:20,117
How?

936
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:24,077
When have you
known him to fight?

937
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,411
Talk shit?

938
00:53:25,413 --> 00:53:26,538
He's not like you. Angel.

939
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,790
Then what do you suggest?

940
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:29,960
Not that.

941
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:32,045
What about that?

942
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:37,591
It's probably locked
like everything else

943
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:39,425
in this fucking bus.

944
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:42,971
Look, our best bet is for
all of us to rush him.

945
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:44,640
He can't stop us all, all right?

946
00:53:44,642 --> 00:53:46,892
We, we, we, we put
Austin in front

947
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:49,645
so he can't target any of us.

948
00:53:49,647 --> 00:53:50,773
That's our only option.

949
00:53:54,985 --> 00:53:56,985
Did you check to
see if it was locked?

950
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:58,904
Jesus Christ, everything is.

951
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:00,488
It would be.

952
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,948
But did you check?

953
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:02,826
No.

954
00:54:07,665 --> 00:54:09,164
Fucking shit.

955
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,999
I don't know how to
fucking unlock this.

956
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:12,083
Goddamn shit.

957
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:12,961
Oh.

958
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:17,130
Grab that curtain.

959
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:18,715
I'll do my best.

960
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:34,523
Come on, hurry up.

961
00:54:34,525 --> 00:54:36,858
- I'm trying, fucking trying.
- Fuck.

962
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:37,695
Get up.

963
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:44,658
Get up, get up.

964
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,034
Ooh, fuck, how much
do you fucking weigh?

965
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:47,578
You need to go higher.

966
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,954
I can't pull myself.

967
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:50,581
Let me take off my jacket.

968
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,042
Oh, God, get off,
get down, get off.

969
00:54:55,212 --> 00:54:56,962
How's it looking out there?

970
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:59,923
Uh, he's still there.

971
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:02,884
It, it looks like the
cop went back to her car.

972
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:04,260
Let us know if anything changes

973
00:55:04,262 --> 00:55:05,931
we're trying to
get her outta here.

974
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:10,350
All right, get
fucking over here.

975
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,281
Okay, everything looks good.

976
00:55:25,283 --> 00:55:27,158
The reason I pulled you over

977
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,744
is because you are just
too close to the highway.

978
00:55:28,746 --> 00:55:29,870
I need you to scoot over.

979
00:55:29,872 --> 00:55:32,163
It's, it's just too dangerous.

980
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:33,832
Um, if you need to,

981
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:36,336
there's a rest stop
about 15 miles that way.

982
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:38,754
- That way?
- Yes.

983
00:55:38,756 --> 00:55:40,421
- 15 miles.
- Correct.

984
00:55:40,423 --> 00:55:43,174
That's great, I'm gonna
put that into my GPS.

985
00:55:43,176 --> 00:55:47,220
Me and my wife have been
traveling for a while now.

986
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:50,849
We're just getting used
to the ways of the road.

987
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:52,809
Is there anything
else I can do for you?

988
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:53,852
No, that should be it.

989
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:55,230
Oh, here one second.

990
00:55:56,273 --> 00:55:57,232
Put your foot in.

991
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:10,201
Put, come on, put
some effort into it.

992
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:16,501
Ah, hold on.

993
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,378
Don't want you leaving
without your documents.

994
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,922
Thank you.

995
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:24,257
Uh, I hope you
have a great night.

996
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:25,466
Stay safe out there.

997
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:26,342
Thank you.

998
00:56:26,344 --> 00:56:27,468
You as well.

999
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:28,806
And thank you for your service.

1000
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:34,017
Guys, guys, he's coming.

1001
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:35,894
Shit.

1002
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:37,813
All right, real quick,
I'm gonna go help Austin.

1003
00:56:37,815 --> 00:56:39,856
Can you manage to get her
up and out with your leg?

1004
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:40,982
Easy.

1005
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:41,860
Okay.

1006
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:50,452
What the fuck are you doing?

1007
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:53,328
I just wanted a seat

1008
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:55,997
that wasn't covered
in my friend's blood.

1009
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:58,001
Get out of that
seat, get back there.

1010
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:21,898
Where's the girl?

1011
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,859
She's in the back.

1012
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:25,276
And the curtain.

1013
00:57:25,278 --> 00:57:26,528
I wanted to give
her a bit of privacy

1014
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:28,488
while she cleans herself up.

1015
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,366
Okay, okay, stop, stop.

1016
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:33,076
Get down, get down.

1017
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:34,538
She doesn't seem like the
kind of person who would care.

1018
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:38,373
Yeah, well, she's
feeling a bit vulnerable.

1019
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:40,542
What about the one
with a bullet hole?

1020
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:41,918
He's also in the back.

1021
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,046
Helping her clean up?

1022
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:46,673
No, he's unconscious.

1023
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:49,427
That's the problem
with you guys' lies,

1024
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:53,054
it sounds good at first,

1025
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:54,556
but there's no subtext.

1026
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:55,682
You know what?

1027
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:56,560
Believe whatever you may.

1028
00:57:57,936 --> 00:57:59,645
It's a great buffer.

1029
00:57:59,647 --> 00:58:01,563
Gives you plenty of time

1030
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:04,440
to come up with supporting
facts, eliminate self-doubt,

1031
00:58:04,442 --> 00:58:06,943
but at the end, the
problem is always the same,

1032
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:09,031
no subtext.

1033
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,575
Whatever, love.

1034
00:58:13,118 --> 00:58:16,036
Jennifer, what was
it about the night

1035
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:18,329
that brought you
and Angel together?

1036
00:58:18,331 --> 00:58:19,207
It didn't.

1037
00:58:20,668 --> 00:58:21,544
No.

1038
00:58:30,678 --> 00:58:34,181
Ah, yes, subtext.

1039
00:58:40,228 --> 00:58:41,104
Fuck.

1040
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:46,401
Shit.

1041
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:50,111
Looks like our boys up.

1042
00:58:51,031 --> 00:58:51,699
Fuck.

1043
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:53,617
Stephanie.

1044
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:57,243
What the fuck?

1045
00:58:57,245 --> 00:58:58,080
Shit.

1046
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:32,114
Stephanie.

1047
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:40,330
Fuck.

1048
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:47,335
What the fuck?

1049
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:49,254
What the fuck?

1050
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:49,921
What the fuck?

1051
00:59:49,923 --> 00:59:51,632
Shit.

1052
00:59:57,515 --> 00:59:58,348
Shit!

1053
00:59:59,307 --> 01:00:00,851
Fuck this, fuck this.

1054
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:19,369
Fuck.

1055
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:33,425
Back the fuck up.

1056
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:37,930
Get out of the way.

1057
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,449
What do you think he's doing?

1058
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:01,660
I don't know.

1059
01:01:03,956 --> 01:01:04,832
Shit.

1060
01:01:25,644 --> 01:01:27,437
Are you hearing that?

1061
01:01:35,445 --> 01:01:37,821
Of course it's a fucking drone.

1062
01:02:08,646 --> 01:02:11,189
I don't think our
boy's going to make it.

1063
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:15,110
Aren't you the optimist?

1064
01:02:18,446 --> 01:02:19,114
Shit.

1065
01:03:07,037 --> 01:03:07,871
God.

1066
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:47,784
We're running behind

1067
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:50,704
so there's been a
change in plans.

1068
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:52,998
I seriously consider
you take this time

1069
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,836
to think about your truths.

1070
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:01,008
Truths, truths.

1071
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:09,349
Austin,

1072
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:14,730
I think it's about time that
we had that conversation.

1073
01:04:15,773 --> 01:04:16,439
No, no.

1074
01:04:18,025 --> 01:04:20,441
It, it's okay, we
could, it can wait.

1075
01:04:20,443 --> 01:04:23,697
Uh-uh, no, it's
waited long enough.

1076
01:04:31,914 --> 01:04:33,206
Let me start by saying

1077
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:38,253
you are an absolutely
beautiful human being.

1078
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:43,926
And no matter the
outcome tonight,

1079
01:04:45,302 --> 01:04:49,222
you deserve so much
better than all of us.

1080
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:54,019
I, I can't say that I agree.

1081
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:58,899
Please let me talk, okay?

1082
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:06,448
My truths,

1083
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:14,456
my truths are disgusting.

1084
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:25,593
While we were dating,
I cheated on you.

1085
01:05:43,861 --> 01:05:45,362
And as time went on

1086
01:05:47,405 --> 01:05:48,866
it kept happening.

1087
01:05:53,245 --> 01:05:56,164
And it wasn't fair to you that
I didn't know how to quit.

1088
01:06:07,259 --> 01:06:09,676
I, I found myself torn

1089
01:06:09,678 --> 01:06:12,139
between these two
worlds that I craved,

1090
01:06:19,688 --> 01:06:21,690
so I broke off with you.

1091
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:24,693
I just wanted to be left alone.

1092
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:31,447
You kept asking me why

1093
01:06:31,449 --> 01:06:36,246
and I knew that the truth
would hurt you more than a lie.

1094
01:06:39,457 --> 01:06:44,462
And you deserve so much
better so I said nothing.

1095
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:51,679
For the longest
time it was hell.

1096
01:06:56,474 --> 01:06:58,561
Once time went on, it
got a little easier.

1097
01:07:02,523 --> 01:07:05,483
That's when I allowed myself
to start talking to you again.

1098
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:08,737
Hey.

1099
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:13,075
You remember who this is?

1100
01:07:20,624 --> 01:07:22,248
You kept getting
busier and busier

1101
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:26,545
and my wait time got
longer and longer.

1102
01:07:26,547 --> 01:07:30,217
And once that's when I
found myself entertained

1103
01:07:34,805 --> 01:07:36,098
by the gossip,

1104
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:41,103
and I started putting
the faces to the names.

1105
01:07:43,313 --> 01:07:46,439
And that's when I realized
that the conversations

1106
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:49,277
were about your employees here.

1107
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:55,699
Tony got really
creative with stealing

1108
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,119
a lot of money from you.

1109
01:07:59,747 --> 01:08:00,748
And Shandon,

1110
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:06,251
she told you that she
and her girlfriend

1111
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:07,546
were trying to have a baby.

1112
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:11,632
She was already pregnant

1113
01:08:11,634 --> 01:08:13,301
when she approached
you for the money.

1114
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:17,848
And I heard she had
abortions prior to that.

1115
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,184
There's a lot more.

1116
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:26,189
And I'm sure Angel
could tell you about it.

1117
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,526
Sad thing is we know she won't

1118
01:08:30,528 --> 01:08:33,697
'cause she only
serves her own agenda.

1119
01:08:35,448 --> 01:08:36,575
Hats to you.

1120
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:40,410
I know you came here
just to convince him

1121
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:41,580
to call off the wedding.

1122
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:45,541
But before we get into that,

1123
01:08:45,543 --> 01:08:48,334
why don't you tell
him who the other was.

1124
01:08:48,336 --> 01:08:50,962
Who would send you to the
gods and teach you languages

1125
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:53,590
that you didn't
even know existed.

1126
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:56,426
Tell them the name that you
would scream every night

1127
01:08:56,428 --> 01:08:58,681
until you fucked
it while you cried.

1128
01:09:00,516 --> 01:09:01,682
I'm sure they would love to
know who could please you.

1129
01:09:01,684 --> 01:09:02,893
It was Angel.

1130
01:09:11,276 --> 01:09:13,571
I cheated on you with Angel.

1131
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:24,414
I did come here tonight

1132
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:27,793
to ask him to call
it off with Chelsi,

1133
01:09:29,545 --> 01:09:33,381
not for my benefit, but for his.

1134
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:43,056
Chelsi plans on leaving you
one year after the merger

1135
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:46,937
and giving half of
everything to Angel.

1136
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:52,901
They know that your
kindness is your weakness.

1137
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:57,656
And that's where the
manipulation was gonna begin.

1138
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:00,492
At first, you'd feel guilty

1139
01:10:02,077 --> 01:10:04,496
and then you just give into
whatever Chelsi wanted.

1140
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:10,919
And as wild as that sounds,

1141
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:15,090
that is how Chandon got
half a million from you.

1142
01:10:26,977 --> 01:10:27,978
Is this true?

1143
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:32,022
No.

1144
01:10:32,024 --> 01:10:34,527
Let's not be ridiculous in
the name of saving face.

1145
01:10:35,653 --> 01:10:38,194
I do have a curiosity though.

1146
01:10:38,196 --> 01:10:41,116
That was quite an elaborate
story, don't you think, Austin?

1147
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:47,039
Care to share how
you concocted it?

1148
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,922
I, uh, I, I don't
mean to offend you,

1149
01:10:57,508 --> 01:11:02,262
but how did you
discover all this?

1150
01:11:09,853 --> 01:11:12,856
Well shit, somebody
actually did it.

1151
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,861
Sean, don't please!

1152
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:21,697
Get up.

1153
01:11:21,699 --> 01:11:24,076
Dude, I fucking told the
truth, what more do you want?

1154
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:26,912
No, you didn't.

1155
01:11:28,205 --> 01:11:30,666
Fuck you, you piece of shit.

1156
01:11:31,584 --> 01:11:32,585
Get up.

1157
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:55,941
Dude, were you
just fucking with us?

1158
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:00,696
I need you to
take 15 steps back.

1159
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,948
And what did you want me to say?

1160
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:06,619
Back the fuck up.

1161
01:12:08,161 --> 01:12:09,037
Austin.

1162
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:11,289
I love you.

1163
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:15,168
I'm so sorry for everything.

1164
01:12:26,013 --> 01:12:26,889
Stop.

1165
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:31,393
Now turn around and
get on your knees.

1166
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:39,941
It's okay.

1167
01:12:39,943 --> 01:12:42,279
Everything will be all right.

1168
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:47,284
Everything will be all right.

1169
01:13:03,842 --> 01:13:05,886
It was always that simple.

1170
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:09,095
I don't know how this
all got out of hand.

1171
01:13:09,097 --> 01:13:11,224
Maybe it was the
drugs or the alcohol.

1172
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:14,102
Maybe it was pride.

1173
01:13:15,979 --> 01:13:17,771
And I think you guys are right,

1174
01:13:17,773 --> 01:13:21,985
it wasn't pride,
it was arrogance.

1175
01:13:24,112 --> 01:13:28,033
Can you just shut up?

1176
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:30,786
I like that.

1177
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:39,252
She isn't lying, is she?

1178
01:13:40,838 --> 01:13:44,214
Remember the truth
will set you free.

1179
01:13:44,216 --> 01:13:45,549
Sean.

1180
01:13:45,551 --> 01:13:46,594
Just saying.

1181
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:54,434
You know, I used to
always get this feeling

1182
01:13:56,186 --> 01:13:58,856
that I just couldn't shake off,

1183
01:14:00,858 --> 01:14:02,860
but I feel like I need
to embrace it now.

1184
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:10,033
I want you to look me in the eye

1185
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:15,871
and tell me that what
she said isn't true.

1186
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:18,414
What's unfair is
regardless of what I say,

1187
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:20,166
I can already tell
you've made up your mind

1188
01:14:20,168 --> 01:14:21,545
about what the truth is.

1189
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:26,047
Just know that Chelsi loves you.

1190
01:14:26,049 --> 01:14:27,423
She's a good girl.

1191
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:33,306
I've always felt terrible
for sleeping with Jennifer.

1192
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:36,266
It was never my
intention to do so,

1193
01:14:36,268 --> 01:14:38,226
but with thee long,
long nights and alcohol

1194
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:39,479
it was bound to happen.

1195
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:43,481
When she left you to pursue me,

1196
01:14:43,483 --> 01:14:46,943
I could not bear the
consequences of my actions

1197
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:49,322
so I immediately cut it off.

1198
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:55,287
I hated myself.

1199
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:07,340
My loyalty has
always been to you.

1200
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:13,430
Please.

1201
01:15:37,788 --> 01:15:39,206
What is this?

1202
01:15:43,251 --> 01:15:44,334
My truth.

1203
01:15:46,254 --> 01:15:47,754
Say my name.

1204
01:15:50,258 --> 01:15:51,134
Angel.

1205
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,553
- Say my name.
- Angel.

1206
01:15:54,555 --> 01:15:55,554
Good girl.

1207
01:15:55,556 --> 01:15:57,097
Oh, my Angel.

1208
01:15:57,099 --> 01:16:00,266
She loved me
before she loved you.

1209
01:16:00,268 --> 01:16:01,810
What is this, Sean?

1210
01:16:10,278 --> 01:16:11,361
Come my darling.

1211
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:14,114
Oh, my God.

1212
01:16:14,116 --> 01:16:15,490
Tell me, love,

1213
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:17,578
are you looking forward
to getting married?

1214
01:16:19,162 --> 01:16:21,872
Can't wait for the divorce.

1215
01:16:21,874 --> 01:16:23,166
Hold on.

1216
01:16:24,627 --> 01:16:27,335
And we are gonna
be rich together.

1217
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:29,507
All he's good for is
his fucking money.

1218
01:16:31,341 --> 01:16:33,426
And we're gonna take it all.

1219
01:16:35,178 --> 01:16:39,180
Oh, my love, you are so right.

1220
01:16:39,182 --> 01:16:40,518
Before me, huh?

1221
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:50,191
Time for me to play with you.

1222
01:16:50,193 --> 01:16:51,486
Bravo, mate.

1223
01:16:53,363 --> 01:16:54,738
The humility is mine.

1224
01:16:55,741 --> 01:16:57,240
You can turn it off now.

1225
01:16:57,242 --> 01:16:58,700
Oh, pull my hair.

1226
01:16:58,702 --> 01:17:00,702
After the good part.

1227
01:17:00,704 --> 01:17:01,580
Turn it off.

1228
01:17:03,206 --> 01:17:04,831
I don't wanna see
this shit anymore.

1229
01:17:05,918 --> 01:17:06,919
All right.

1230
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:15,928
You lied.

1231
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:24,394
Oh, Aussie, you're
absolutely brilliant at coding,

1232
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:28,941
but in everything else,
you're a fucking idiot.

1233
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:33,696
We're here.

1234
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,364
Now get the fuck
out both of yous.

1235
01:17:40,493 --> 01:17:41,453
You first, mate.

1236
01:17:42,538 --> 01:17:43,413
Ladies first.

1237
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:45,666
Bitch.

1238
01:18:14,862 --> 01:18:19,867
I feel so much
anger towards you,

1239
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:24,705
towards everyone.

1240
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:30,836
I feel betrayed.

1241
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,796
Feel whatever you like.

1242
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:36,715
But do me a favor,

1243
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:39,593
take responsibility for the
events that occurred tonight.

1244
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:41,471
Face your truth!

1245
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:43,930
You allowed this to happen,

1246
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:46,434
you spineless fucking coward.

1247
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:50,606
Oh, look at you
quivering in fear.

1248
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:53,441
Anxiety.

1249
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:57,193
It's just anxiety.

1250
01:18:57,195 --> 01:19:02,200
Now, Austin, tell me, what do
you feel when you look at her.

1251
01:19:07,205 --> 01:19:08,081
Anger.

1252
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:11,084
Frustration.

1253
01:19:13,045 --> 01:19:17,132
Now tell me, what would
you like to do to her?

1254
01:19:20,553 --> 01:19:25,263
I want to see her hurt.

1255
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:26,515
Hurt.

1256
01:19:26,517 --> 01:19:27,849
What sort of hurt?

1257
01:19:27,851 --> 01:19:29,893
Are we talking
about feelings hurt?

1258
01:19:29,895 --> 01:19:32,187
Are we talking about
like a bum fucking knee?

1259
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:33,231
What sort of hurt?

1260
01:19:34,525 --> 01:19:36,694
Like not breathing hurt.

1261
01:19:37,945 --> 01:19:40,698
See, it's in our blood.

1262
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:52,167
When you pull that trigger,

1263
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:58,090
you're finally gonna be winning
back ownership of your life.

1264
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:02,217
I want to.

1265
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,928
Sean, despite the
truth being told,

1266
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,138
do I not get the
opportunity to live?

1267
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:11,103
Honestly, you were the only
one guaranteed to die tonight.

1268
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:13,647
Lucky me.

1269
01:20:15,608 --> 01:20:16,274
Oh, go on then.

1270
01:20:34,334 --> 01:20:38,837
I just, I don't
know if killing you

1271
01:20:38,839 --> 01:20:41,258
is going to take
away any of the pain.

1272
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:43,176
Coward.

1273
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:51,059
There, it's a
little more personal.

1274
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:54,855
That's not what I meant.

1275
01:20:58,942 --> 01:21:01,735
Well, this is just about
as personal as it gets.

1276
01:21:01,737 --> 01:21:03,028
Beat her fucking ass.

1277
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:04,696
What are we doing here?

1278
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:08,033
I, I, I, I, I can't fight.

1279
01:21:08,035 --> 01:21:09,450
Oh, for Christ's sake.

1280
01:21:09,452 --> 01:21:12,203
I'm not always gonna
be here to protect you.

1281
01:21:12,205 --> 01:21:14,998
You have to learn to
stand up for yourself.

1282
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,250
Now I'm gonna leave you to this.

1283
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:19,753
I gotta take care of the bus.

1284
01:21:36,063 --> 01:21:40,400
I've always wanted
to see your face break.

1285
01:21:42,485 --> 01:21:44,528
I wanna see you suffer.

1286
01:21:47,866 --> 01:21:49,952
You fucking piece of shit.

1287
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,454
Fucking coward, fight back.

1288
01:21:54,456 --> 01:21:56,289
Fight the fuck back, Austin!

1289
01:22:03,924 --> 01:22:06,257
Stand up and fight for
once in your fucking life.

1290
01:22:06,259 --> 01:22:07,258
Fuck you, Angel!

1291
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:08,510
Oh, shit!

1292
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:12,263
I want you to start
to fight back!

1293
01:22:18,021 --> 01:22:20,021
Come on you piece of shit!

1294
01:22:27,615 --> 01:22:29,072
Aussie!

1295
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:29,950
Aussie.

1296
01:22:31,368 --> 01:22:32,244
Goddammit!

1297
01:22:39,126 --> 01:22:40,460
Oh, fucking piss.

1298
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:43,255
Goddammit!

1299
01:22:46,424 --> 01:22:50,428
Fucking piece of shit.

1300
01:22:53,932 --> 01:22:55,015
Fuck you.

1301
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,437
Motherfucker!

1302
01:23:01,565 --> 01:23:04,151
Fuck, he really can't fight.

1303
01:23:06,278 --> 01:23:08,486
How does that feel, huh?

1304
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:10,196
How does that feel, Aussie, huh?

1305
01:23:11,324 --> 01:23:13,619
Fucking, oh, take it like a man.

1306
01:23:14,537 --> 01:23:17,078
Oh, you fucking coward.

1307
01:23:18,081 --> 01:23:20,749
All right, I'm coming.

1308
01:23:20,751 --> 01:23:21,585
Fuck.

1309
01:23:25,548 --> 01:23:27,508
Fucking hell.

1310
01:23:40,646 --> 01:23:42,478
Time's up.

1311
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,607
Oh, hell no.

1312
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:45,526
Oh my God.

1313
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:23,564
How you feeling, brother?

1314
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:28,569
Physically like shit.

1315
01:24:31,154 --> 01:24:34,199
Emotionally, really good.

1316
01:24:36,451 --> 01:24:37,452
My hand hurts.

1317
01:24:39,287 --> 01:24:40,664
Yeah, I can tell
you got a knife in it.

1318
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:43,874
Yeah, that, that makes sense.

1319
01:24:48,338 --> 01:24:50,797
You wanna learn something cool?

1320
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:51,840
Sure.

1321
01:24:51,842 --> 01:24:52,676
Follow me.

1322
01:24:55,596 --> 01:24:56,764
Where are you going now?

1323
01:25:00,433 --> 01:25:03,560
Now I'm gonna teach
you a technique.

1324
01:25:03,562 --> 01:25:05,646
It's one of my favorites.

1325
01:25:05,648 --> 01:25:08,441
Totally consistent
across the board.

1326
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:18,619
The ankle is a very
complex structure.

1327
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:23,830
It opens so many
creative possibilities.

1328
01:25:23,832 --> 01:25:25,331
This,

1329
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:29,335
this is the achilles tendon.

1330
01:25:29,337 --> 01:25:31,797
Stop, please stop!

1331
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:33,674
Please.

1332
01:25:33,676 --> 01:25:35,592
When you absolutely,
positively gonna make sure

1333
01:25:35,594 --> 01:25:39,807
a motherfucker ain't going
anywhere except no substitutes.

1334
01:25:41,892 --> 01:25:42,768
Now you.

1335
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,356
Aussie.

1336
01:25:49,775 --> 01:25:51,441
Right here.

1337
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:52,609
That's it.

1338
01:25:53,737 --> 01:25:55,322
No, please stop!

1339
01:25:56,907 --> 01:26:00,619
Oh, the begging
you're so terrible at.

1340
01:26:05,791 --> 01:26:09,545
So, uh, so what do
you up to tomorrow?

1341
01:26:12,715 --> 01:26:15,801
I was, uh supposed
to get married.

1342
01:26:17,928 --> 01:26:20,470
Huh, you're still
going through with that?

1343
01:26:21,682 --> 01:26:23,934
Uh, I don't think so.

1344
01:26:25,811 --> 01:26:28,856
You know, I, I got a couple
more days left on my vacation.

1345
01:26:30,398 --> 01:26:31,358
You wanna hang out?

1346
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:33,777
Yeah.

1347
01:26:35,613 --> 01:26:40,618
And I, I have to ask,
I, I, how'd you find me?

1348
01:26:42,703 --> 01:26:43,704
I never lost you.

1349
01:26:45,038 --> 01:26:46,039
I never lost you.

1350
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:51,668
See when I was locked up,

1351
01:26:52,796 --> 01:26:54,757
Ma kept coming to see me.

1352
01:26:56,133 --> 01:26:57,883
Every day I would
deny her visits,

1353
01:26:57,885 --> 01:27:02,890
but eventually I gave
in, allowed her to.

1354
01:27:04,432 --> 01:27:06,517
Then she told me
some of the things

1355
01:27:06,519 --> 01:27:09,772
about you that concerned her.

1356
01:27:11,649 --> 01:27:13,191
People hurting you.

1357
01:27:14,777 --> 01:27:19,532
And I learned about
John and, uh, Monica.

1358
01:27:20,908 --> 01:27:23,827
Yeah, how Ma owed them money

1359
01:27:25,203 --> 01:27:27,455
and they wanted you
to come work for them.

1360
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:32,208
Mom wasn't gonna have
you throw away your life.

1361
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:36,715
She kept quiet and
did it herself.

1362
01:27:38,551 --> 01:27:42,680
Working for those people
eventually got her killed.

1363
01:27:45,933 --> 01:27:47,933
When I was released,
I joined the military.

1364
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:50,604
I discovered I had a gift.

1365
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:56,026
Spent years refining it.

1366
01:27:58,236 --> 01:28:03,200
I, uh, I always had
someone checking up on you.

1367
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:07,536
It was when I heard
about the marriage

1368
01:28:07,538 --> 01:28:12,123
and that whole,
that whole thing,

1369
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:13,834
that I needed to
take a vacation.

1370
01:28:13,836 --> 01:28:16,839
I put in the request
and it was approved.

1371
01:28:18,757 --> 01:28:23,762
I had one of the girls
plant the seed in her head

1372
01:28:25,138 --> 01:28:27,598
and as I predicted,
she took the bait.

1373
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:32,605
I bought the bus, had my team
make certain modifications.

1374
01:28:36,274 --> 01:28:41,238
And clearly, you know, I'm
not in this for the business.

1375
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:44,656
So I offered a price
that was too tempting

1376
01:28:44,658 --> 01:28:48,203
for someone like her to pass up.

1377
01:28:50,623 --> 01:28:53,832
We finished setting up the
bus about, I don't know,

1378
01:28:53,834 --> 01:28:57,293
maybe about six hours
before we had to be there.

1379
01:28:57,295 --> 01:29:02,259
Me and the guys we
spray painted it,

1380
01:29:03,802 --> 01:29:05,846
still wet when we
pulled up at the club.

1381
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:08,724
I think it turned out all right.

1382
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:18,776
Do you think that the bus
should have exploded by now?

1383
01:29:20,736 --> 01:29:22,402
No.

1384
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:26,992
See explosions, they, they
spread evidence far and wide.

1385
01:29:28,869 --> 01:29:30,285
You gotta let it burn

1386
01:29:30,287 --> 01:29:33,206
for a little while
before it goes boom.

1387
01:29:35,458 --> 01:29:38,045
Are we a, are, are we safe here?

1388
01:29:39,171 --> 01:29:40,295
Probably not.

1389
01:29:40,297 --> 01:29:44,092
We need to drag her back closer.

1390
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:46,094
Use your good hand.

1391
01:29:57,815 --> 01:30:02,025
So are you like a
secret agent or something?

1392
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:03,944
Definitely secret, but no,

1393
01:30:03,946 --> 01:30:07,488
I'm just a guy who knows how
to ask all the right questions

1394
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:09,535
to get an honest answer.

1395
01:30:13,121 --> 01:30:17,457
There's so much I
wanna know about you.

1396
01:30:17,459 --> 01:30:19,127
I got so many questions.

1397
01:30:20,546 --> 01:30:22,297
I'm not really that interesting.

1398
01:30:23,507 --> 01:30:24,842
Not that interesting?

1399
01:30:29,179 --> 01:30:30,596
Not compared to you.

1400
01:30:32,349 --> 01:30:33,934
I find that hard to believe.

1401
01:30:36,353 --> 01:30:38,019
Believe it.

1402
01:30:38,021 --> 01:30:39,272
I'm telling you the truth.

1403
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:47,362
What is that?

1404
01:30:47,364 --> 01:30:49,867
This is a wedding gift.

1405
01:30:51,201 --> 01:30:53,120
Or at least it was
when I got it for you.

1406
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:55,621
What is it?

1407
01:30:55,623 --> 01:30:57,207
We'll open the goddamn box.

1408
01:30:59,543 --> 01:31:01,126
It's kind of heavy.

1409
01:31:21,231 --> 01:31:25,609
Is that?

1410
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:42,335
Well, it was either, it
was either that or a toaster.

1411
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:48,509
I'm glad it wasn't the toaster.

1412
01:31:51,303 --> 01:31:54,222
You know, I'm really
glad that you came along.

1413
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:56,266
Yeah, me too.

1414
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,601
You got some great friends.

1415
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:04,066
Let's head on outta here.

1416
01:32:51,363 --> 01:32:54,447
Oh, bloody hell,
I'm chopped to bits.

1417
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:57,242
Go on, show us your white bits.

1418
01:32:57,244 --> 01:32:58,370
What these?

1419
01:33:00,205 --> 01:33:01,830
♪ My milkshake brings all
the boys to the yard ♪

1420
01:33:01,832 --> 01:33:03,456
♪ And damn right, they're
better than yours ♪

1421
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:05,458

better than yours ♪

1422
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:08,338
