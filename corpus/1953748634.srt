Are you depressed? Was he
giving you a ride home?

177
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,562
Yeah, I was cheering you up.
Yeah, good for you.

178
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,722
You know who else is pretty sad?
Frank over here.

179
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,644
Right, Frank? You get sad 'cause
you shit and piss yourself?

180
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,721
You having a sad day, Frank?

181
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,211
Hey, maybe you can put him
in the back of your car.

182
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,090
You want to shit and piss
all over this guy's car?

183
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,446
Let's open up the...

184
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,970
Frank, you wanna shit your pants and get in the...
Oh, Good, it's open.

185
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,565
I can put Frank in there.

186
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,211
He can shit and piss
himself until he's happy.

187
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,851
I got some towels...
Does that sound good?

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,361
Why don't you let me
see your I.D.?

189
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,447
Oh, come on, please?

190
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,330
Let me take the whole thing.

191
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,010
I don't...
It's good, I got it.

192
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,811
Oh, good.

193
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,088
I got nervous that
maybe you didn't have

194
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,162
a wife and a whole
bunch of kids, but...

195
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,727
...luckily you do.
What's your wife's name?

196
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,961
Bella.

197
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,804
Oh, Bella. Good.

198
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,802
Hey, can I borrow your phone for a minute?
My battery's out.

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,411
Why do you want
to borrow my phone?

200
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,845
Because I asked
you for your phone.

201
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,327
Give me your fucking phone.
Shut your mouth.

202
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,247
Can you give me one chance here?
(RINGING)

203
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,408
Yeah, I'll give you one chance.

204
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,244
Yeah, who's this? Is this Bella?
(GASPS)

205
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,401
No, no, no!

206
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,090
Don't do that. Don't do that.
(GROANING)

207
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,646
This is Officer Mullins.
I'm here with your husband.

208
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,882
God! What are you, Spock?
(GROANING)

209
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,966
No, he's not been in an
accident, unfortunately.

210
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,122
I do have him here
with a known prostitute.

211
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,806
She's lying!
Bella, she's lying!

212
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,043
Oh, that's not
the first time, huh?

213
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,802
Yeah, that's him. He's crying because
I'm breaking his fucking hand.

214
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,565
Oh, she said do it harder.

215
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,404
Ow! All right, Bella.
That's for Bella.

216
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,167
You got to go with
your instincts, Bella.

217
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,490
You're welcome.

218
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,807
She's probably gonna
burn your shit today.

219
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,445
You don't understand.

220
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,647
She just had a baby.

221
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,649
There's a lot going on down there.
I'm not gonna touch that!

222
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,968
Why don't you take
your seatbelt off?

223
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,121
Come on, please.

224
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,965
You seem reasonable.
Take your fucking belt off.

225
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,610
You look like you
got some compassion.

226
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,962
I love the sound
of a guy that...

227
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,925
...after his wife gives him
his fifth fucking child,

228
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,968
complains about
her messy vagina.

229
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,322
And then you don't want
to fucking touch her?

230
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,090
I can unlock the door!

231
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,367
Get out of the fucking car!

232
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,801
Get out of the fucking car!

233
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,166
MAN: Are you kidding me?

234
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,363
Get up against the car.
What is your problem?

235
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,286
You want to do that?

236
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,600
It's hot! The car is hot!

237
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,286
Good! I hope it burns
your fucking dick off.

238
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,490
MULLINS: Hey, it's Rojas!
My favorite asshole.

239
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,205
Look what I found.

240
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,529
Did I take some of your business away?
That's a shame.

241
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,441
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just stand on this corner...

242
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,005
...and do my sodukas, okay?

243
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,321
Oh, is that right? First of
all, it's sudoku, dumb-ass.

244
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,491
And you want to tell me that
you're just here coincidentally?

245
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,569
Right in the middle
of all the prostitutes?

246
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,722
Lady, why are you
so obsessed with me?

247
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,881
You should be ashamed,

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,651
trying to break down a successful
black man. You racist?

249
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,121
Don't play that race
bullshit card with me!

250
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,721
Nine out of ten guys
I fuck are black guys!

251
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,965
Lady, what you need to do is go down
the road, take a vacation, okay?

252
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,562
And go get your groove back.
Lady, just relax. Chill. Okay?

253
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,401
What is that?

254
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,407
Take off.

255
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,241
That's what I thought.

256
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,289
MAN: I'm not
a part of this!

257
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,044
MULLINS: Shut up! Shut up!

258
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,926
MAN: Oh, my God!

259
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,685
Oh, it's on. (LAUGHS)

260
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,921
She's crazy!

261
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,726
Come on, please let me out. I
get really carsick. (PLEADING)

262
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,763
Oh, no, that's terrible!

263
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,082
I got him now.
I got him!

264
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,930
You are a meth head!

265
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,566
Oh, my God!

266
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,125
Hey, look who's here!

267
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,521
(LAUGHING)

268
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,125
Yeah, you better run!

269
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,406
Oh, shit.

270
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,644
I got him! I got him!

271
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,121
You piece of shit, I said stop!

272
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,090
I said stop!

273
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,521
I said stop!

274
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,806
You're crushing my balls!

275
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,644
I hope they fucking rupture!

276
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,844
Lady, get the fuck off me! What
the hell is wrong with you?

277
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,405
(GROANING)

278
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,727
(WHIMPERING)

279
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,007
Bella, I'm sorry!

280
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,442
Let me go! Hold still,
you piece of shit!

281
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,325
My leg, lady! Let me go!

282
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,965
What is wrong with you?

283
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,169
I'll tell you what's the matter with me!
It's you, piece of shit!

284
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,171
Son of a bitch!

285
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,805
Stop moving!

286
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,325
Leave me alone!

287
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,568
Get off me! Get off me!

288
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,966
Shit. OW!

289
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,801
MULLINS: Yeah.

290
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,805
What the hell did
you throw at me?

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,047
A watermelon.

292
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,360
A watermelon?

293
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,682
Aw, hell, no! See, I told
you you was a racist.

294
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,880
I tried to hit you with my car.
What's that make me?

295
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,526
Let's see what you got in...
Oh, look at this!

296
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,450
Look at this.
Not even my birthday.

297
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,170
Hey, you planted
that shit on me!

298
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,810
Yeah, I planted it.
I'm innocent!

299
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,760
Shut up before I feed you watermelon.
Get up!

300
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,041
Levy?

301
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,242
Federal Agent Sarah Ashburn
from the New York field office.

302
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,327
Hi, how are you?

303
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,767
I need all your files on all
known drug dealers of the area.

304
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,729
Right. We heard
you were coming.

305
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,370
Actually, I was expecting it.

306
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,881
I'll show you to your desk.

307
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,360
Not necessary.
I won't be here long.

308
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,210
I can carry these.
Thank you.

309
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,609
Whoa! Hey! Ashburn!

310
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,887
Oh!
Oh, God!

311
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,365
You okay?
What is it?

312
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,285
Low-end dealer just brought
into the East Boston precinct.

313
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,930
Name's Terrell Rojas.

314
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,563
Oh. Oh, okay.

315
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,722
Good. Thank you very much.
Good luck out there.

316
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,680
It's not about luck, pal.
Not about luck.

317
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,241
(BRAKES SQUEAL)

318
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,081
Wow.

319
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,449
That was almost cool.

320
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,163
Almost. (CHUCKLES)

321
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,682
Come on, come on.

322
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,962
Ain't gonna fucking park today?

323
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,760
All right.
Here we go. Finally.

324
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,205
I'm moving in there!

325
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,441
No, don't...

326
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,205
Hey, hey!
No, get back in your car!

327
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,886
Hey, asshole!

328
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,125
Goddamn it!

329
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,121
FBI.

330
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,965
Hey, you need to sign in.

331
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,131
Captain Woods?

332
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,286
Captain Woods?

333
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,169
Christ.
I'm sorry?

334
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,130
Uh... How can I help you?

335
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,130
Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.

336
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,884
We got intel recently
that you brought in

337
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,530
a dealer by the name
of Terrell Rojas.

338
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,842
Yeah, but Detective Mullins
isn't back from lunch yet.

339
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm sure he won't mind.

340
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,327
He's a she, and we're not
allowed to go near her collars.

341
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,971
Let me tell you what I think.

342
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,480
Every second
we're standing here

343
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,885
is interfering with
the federal investigation.

344
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,162
So if you'd be so kind
as to show Mr. Rojas

345
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,004
to an interrogation room.
Thank you.

346
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,045
Special Agent?

347
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,331
This way.

348
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,005
Special Agent.

349
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,330
Special Agent.

350
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,680
Shit.

351
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,011
You are looking at
possession with intent...

352
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,046
...which is a class D drug charge,
chapter 94C, section 32A.

353
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,288
I had a joint and a few
little bags of coke.

354
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,600
Since when is
that shit illegal?

355
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,603
The answer to your
question is always.

356
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,370
And with your priors...

357
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,047
...you are looking at 25 years
and some pretty stiff fines.

358
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,045
Who the hell cares about fines?
That's 25 years!

359
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,523
Never mind. Let's see
what you make of these.

360
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,725
What I make of them...

361
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,282
...is that somebody doesn't want
somebody else selling on their turf.

362
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,043
But you're still here... and you're alive.
Why is that?

363
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,725
Who you working for?
Nobody.

364
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,961
Who you working for?
Nobody.

365
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,121
Who you working for?
Nobody!

366
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,804
If I tell you,
that's my ass chopped up

367
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,405
into a million
motherfucking pieces!

368
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,485
Goddamn it.

369
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,686

God. Puss!

Motherfucker!

park in my spot. Goddamn it!

(SIGHS) I don't
want you to do time.

380
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,291
I don't want you to get chopped
up into little, tiny...

381
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,963
...mother-F-ing pieces. Oh.

382
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,602
I can protect you. I can.
But you've got to help me.

383
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,921
I can help you.

384
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,770
You'll help me?
Yeah.

385
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,285
Where can I find Julian?

386
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,411
I get my stuff from this bitch
named Tatiana on Newkirk Avenue.

387
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,971
Can you describe her?

388
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,930
She got brown eyes.

389
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,603
She got some
big-ass breastses.

390
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,085
Big breastses.
Okay.

391
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,523
Can you maybe be a little
bit more specific?

392
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,726
Her breastses is like this.

393
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,605
Okay. Thank you.

394
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,564
That's a shame.

395
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,881
Don't.

396
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,005
Oh! Ha-ha! Oh, yeah!
We're at a comedy party!

397
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,726
Move the fuck out of my way.
Get a room.

398
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,003
Tim, you still owe me $40.

399
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,244
Yeah, tomorrow it's $60!
Fucking dickweed.

400
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,164
Why is the cage empty?

401
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,767
What did I tell you
about moving my prisoners?

402
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,331
He's in interrogation.

403
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,804
Why would he be in interrogation
when I'm standing right here?

404
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,247
They came and got him.

405
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,367
Who's "they"?

406
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,562
It better be two of me.
Is it two of me?

407
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,767
It was a lady.

408
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,285
I'm a lady.
Did I come and get him?

409
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,482
No, it was a different lady.
She was nice.

410
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,882
I'm fucking nice.
Why was she nice to you?

411
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,485
She made me give her the keys.

412
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,722
I'm gonna make you
fucking bend over...

413
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,962
...and I'm gonna reach up
your ass into your pocket

414
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,485
and get the keys to your house.

415
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,449
Then I'm gonna drive there...

416
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,762
...come in your front door
and kill you in your sleep.

417
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,407
I think I have a clear idea
of what we're looking for,

418
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,720
and I appreciate your time.

419
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,649
Wow, lady, you're on
a real fucking roll.

420
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,887
Excuse me?

421
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,246
No, I won't excuse you.

422
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,971
I just spent the last 30 minutes
thinking of ways to kill you.

423
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,083
I'm sorry, when did we meet?

424
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,321
Is this your lawyer?

425
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,086
Are you an insurance salesman?
Do you sell those shitty suits?

426
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,766
I'm Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.
How can I help you?

427
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,930
You can get all of that
and get the fuck out of here.

428
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,081
This is my room

429
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,322
Were you about to be
questioned by a detective?

430
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,285
I am a detective
and that's my perp.

431
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,728
Ah! I understand now.

432
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,044
Detective, Mr. Rojas will
be continuing on with me.

433
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,483
No.
It's a jurisdictional issue.

434
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,766
Not gonna happen.

435
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,410
Your efforts are duly noted.

436
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,527
Oh, great.

437
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,171
And if you're okay with
everything, could you just...

438
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,402
...close the door on the way out?
I'll shut the door on you.

439
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,130
Will you lay down and put
your head in the door?

440
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,329
I'll slam it
about 157,000 times.

441
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,925
Aw, shit, girl, you better run.

442
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,923
Shut your mouth.
Run like you on fire.

443
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,161
Be quiet.

444
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,322
Get up and we'll
settle this outside.

445
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,164
I won't be going outside.

446
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,687
You're gonna get up
and come outside.

447
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,921
No, ma'am.

448
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,764
Fine. We'll do this inside.

449
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,129
Can somebody remove this person
from the interrogation room?

450
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,563
Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of.
It runs in many families.

451
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,767
I'm gonna hit you.

452
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,046
You're not. Please don't.

453
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,402
I'm gonna hit you and knock
all your little buttons.

454
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,607
I'm gonna hit you there,
or here...

455
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,806
Do not put your finger in...

456
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,166
Stop touching my buttons!

457
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,321
Stop wearing buttons.

458
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,642
Don't move those
fucking hands at me.

459
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,450
I'll get that stupid barrette!

460
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,443
I'll take that barrette right
out of your fucking hair!

461
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,489
Stop, stop, stop!

462
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,366
Both of you... my office now.

463
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,764
Nope. Not in there.

464
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,322
There is nothing I can do, Mullins.
The FBI has jurisdiction.

465
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,250
Maybe they're in here.

466
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,846
Stop. Will you stop?

467
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,046
Nope, they're not in there.

468
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,851
What is she doing?

469
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,443
She's looking for my balls.

470
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,042
Hey, if anyone sees
the Captain's balls...

471
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,923
...let me know. They're about
this big, but a lot tinier.

472
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,443
They're like a pea... or
like a ball bearing.

473
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,287
Or if you've ever seen a mouse
ball, about half that size.

474
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,126
Incredibly tiny. They're
like really, really tiny...

475
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,886
...little girl balls.
If little girls had balls.

476
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,806
So if you find little,
tiny girl balls...

477
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,924
...that are so fucking
tiny and shriveled up...

478
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,244
...let me know, because I'll put
them right back up his scrotum!

479
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,686
Knock it off.

480
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,604
How about you do
something for once?

481
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,000
What do you want me to do?

482
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,321
Have my back

483
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,846
and stop being so goddamn
disappointing like everybody else!

484
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,331
Well, that was professional.

485
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,090
Was that not professional?
Here.

486
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,891
Let me be professional. Let
me help you pick up your bag.

487
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,121
That's very mature.

488
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,761
Let me just
straighten that shit up.

489
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,565
Oh, wait, hey!

490
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,166
Good news! Good news,
I found his balls!

491
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,405
In a clear sack! Yeah, enjoy that.
Shove those back up there.

492
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,565
Cop of the year!

493
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,410
Keep it up!

494
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,324
This job is destroying me.

495
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,120
You know how old I am?

496
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,846
58?

497
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,163
I'm 43 years old.

498
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,606
Mmm-hmm.

499
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,330
Well, I always round up.

500
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,131
I have a five-year-old son
who calls me grandpa!

501
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,603
So, uh... anyhoo, sir...

502
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,367
...if you could
just... you know...

503
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,161
...keep her... away from me...

504
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,841
...that would
be... very helpful.

505
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,880
She stole your keys,
didn't she?

506
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,202
Yes, she did. Do you know
where I can find her?

507
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,125
She's probably at O'Flanagan's.
It's a bar down the street.

508
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,726
It's a little divey.
You might want to wear a vest.

509
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,649
<i>Okay I'm Rambo I ramshack</i>

510
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,404
<i>I'm next to that cheese
like rat traps</i>

511
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,005
<i>On top of that green
like grass ass</i>

512
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,445
<i>That's over y'all head
like snapbacks</i>

513
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,280
<i>I get it where I fit in,
put up then I put in</i>

514
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,924
<i>Tryna find an ass
I can put my fucking foot in</i>

515
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,161
<i>Run this shit,
no, I run this shit</i>

516
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,041
<i>Don't give one fuck, bitch
I done this shit...</i>

517
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,164
Sir, is this place open?
Is there a door... Oh.

518
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,602
So there is. Could you point
it out to me with your finger?

519
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,524
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

520
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,125
ASHBURN: Hand them over.
Give me the keys. Now.

521
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,441
Oh, my God.

522
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,125
Did you drop something?

523
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,366
I apologize.

524
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,121
You are so concerned about
taking down a guy like Rojas...

525
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,525
...wasting all this time

526
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,280
when I could have stopped a drug
lord who is far more dangerous...

527
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,442
...and supplies to
people like Rojas.

528
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,563
Bullshit. Who?

529
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,329
Okay, you want to
see some bull feces?

530
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,249
I think I said "bullshit".

531
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,727
Here's some bull poo-poo.
How does that look?

532
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,327
See that? Oh, come on.
I got a kid here.

533
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,641
Oh, I'm so sorry.

534
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,086
I'm very, very sorry.

535
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,601
Wait a minute, this is a bar.

536
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,207
No, absolutely not.
No, no, no, no.

537
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,402
Why do I not know
who Simon Larkin is?

538
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,325
That would probably be because
the FBI knows more than you do.

539
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,165
Anything happening in my
neighborhood I have a right to know.

540
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,324
No, you actually don't.
You want to know.

541
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,811
And you do not
have the clearance

542
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,168
that would allow you to read
everything that is in this file.

543
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,521
Okay, all right!

544
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,247
When bad shit happens
in my neighborhood,

545
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,561
I get a little
passionate about it.

546
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,725
I shouldn't have read your files.
I went too far.

547
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,082
Well, I accept your apology.

548
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,803
But you need to understand that
this is a highly important case.

549
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,850
And the information is
highly, highly sensitive.

550
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,331
Therefore we have
these clearances.

551
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,246
I don't have the clearances.
Right? I mean, you are...

552
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,722
You are, wow, FBI.

553
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,084
I mean, you are a goddamn
angel of the law.

554
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,044
Well, that's a little...

555
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,481
I want you to spread those
wings and just soar.

556
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,690
Watch it!

557
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,442
You watch it.
I'm a federal agent.

558
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,964
WOMAN: Oh, yeah? Well, guess what, you dick!
I'm a federal agent, too!

559
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,964
I work at the post office.

560
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,968
Well, I appreciate the work you do
for us on the ground. Thank you.

561
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,645
You bet your ass you do.

562
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,724
I see no one will be
getting their mail today!

563
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,121
MULLINS: Good burn.

564
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,482
Good burn. You got burned,
you big drunk paddy!

565
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,768
WOMAN: Kiss my cunt,
you twat!

566
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,082
So we are good?

567
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,281
Thank you.
Thank you.

568
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,891
America thanks you.

569
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,206
And I it.

570
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,606
And it you.

571
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,041
Thank you.

572
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,446
Whoa!

573
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,124
Yes, okay.

574
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,801
Good day.

575
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,806
Dumbass.

576
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,684
MULLINS: So how
you been, Jason?

577
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,844
You want to talk
about Simon Larkin?

578
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,525
I never heard of him.

579
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,920
Don't lie to me.

580
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,082
You're my brother,
I know when you're lying.

581
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,487
I'm just a low-level guy.

582
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,286
I heard of Larkin
but I never met him.

583
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,922
He's a goddamn animal, and I'm
trying to keep him from meeting you.

584
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,084
You gonna storm through Boston
and take down a drug lord?

585
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,771
Yeah, I might.

586
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,650
Have you met me?

587
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,281
Yeah, unfortunately.

588
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,490
Yeah, shut up. (CHUCKLES)

589
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,484
Look, I get out tomorrow.

590
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,166
I'm coming home.
I'm gonna be fine.

591
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,004
I promise, all right?

592
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,091
Oh! Never approach me if
I'm not expecting you!

593
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,090
What are you, an animal?

594
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,646
You said you would
stay off my case,

595
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,361
and now I find you in front
of Tatiana's apartment.

596
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,727
I live here.

597
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,521
Oh, that's hilarious.
You know what's not funny?

598
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,087
That you stole a
confidential FBI case file.

599
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,044
I don't remember any of that.

600
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,443
I'm going to say it one more time.
Stand down, Officer.

601
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,006
Fuck off, Officer.

602
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,845
Oh, okay, now you've really done it.
I'm going to call my boss.

603
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,441
Yeah, you do that, tattle tits!

604
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,441
Fucking narc!

605
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,802
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

606
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,927
(RINGING)

607
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,248
<i>It's Ashburn, sir.
I need authorization...</i>

608
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,683
...to suspend a police officer
from my investigation.

609
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,884
Ashburn, why is working with local
authorities a problem for you?

610
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,041
<i>Sir, it's not.</i>

611
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,971
I understand how this might
sound coming from me...

612
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,006
...but I think this individual might
actually be mentally unstable.

613
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,527
Her captain says she
grew up on those streets

614
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,601
and knows them
better than anyone.

615
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,563
That seems like an asset
to our investigation.

616
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,967
Sir, I...

617
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,326
No, just work with her.

618
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,006
Show me you can do this
or forget the promotion.

619
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,245
Well, sir, no need to take someone's badge.
I think I can, uh...

620
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,842
I think I can work
something out, sir.

621
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,844
All right. Thank you.

622
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,090
You know, uh...

623
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,850
I just...

624
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,287
I think you and I got off
on the wrong foot.

625
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,521
Oh!

626
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,602
I don't know Boston,
and you obviously have...

627
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,843
...a lot of resources and a lot of
knowledge about the area that could be,

628
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,445
you know, useful.

629
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,364
Probably very.
So, uh...

630
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,364
...maybe we can work
together on this.

631
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,046
I don't need your help
to take down Larkin.

632
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,726
You wouldn't even have known
about Larkin if not for me.

633
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,161
So obviously the FBI can
get information you can't.

634
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,529
And there's a lot more
where that comes from. A lot!

635
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,684
Maybe I just need to hear a little
"I need your help, Mullins."

636
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,171
I won't be doing that.

637
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,163
Okay, then get your
ass back in your car.

638
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,685
This is ridiculous.

639
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,002
I'm an FBI agent.
You're a police officer.

640
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,844
"I need your help, Mullins."

641
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,845
I need your help, Mullins.

642
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,483
What is this, a whisper party? I
want that third floor to hear it.

643
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,170
"I need your help, Mullins." Then
give me a little echo on "Mullins".

644
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,049
I need your help, Mullins,
Mullins, Mullins...

645
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,884
Just move. Move, move!

646
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,640
God! Even in that,
you're annoying.

647
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,649
I will work with you...

648
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,161
...as long as we're clear
that this is my case.

649
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,442
That's actually
not... correct.

650
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,682
Awesome.
Glad you see it my way.

651
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,251
Careful of the car.

652
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,801
Goddamn it.

653
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,403
Stand down.
I got it.

654
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,483
If you just let go...
I got it.

655
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,846
ASHBURN: I have it,
just let me...

656
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,126
MULLINS: I've got it.

657
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,931
I got it.

658
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,604
Oh, shit!

659
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,049
(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)

660
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,767
Ma'am, you, uh...

661
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,609
<i>Just go. Just go.</i>

662
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,767
Let me take the lead on this.
I'm a trained interviewer.

663
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,241
"Interviewer?" What are
you, Barbara Walters?

664
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,085
I thought we'd go in there and
bring in some heat on her.

665
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,242
I'm sorry, what does
that even mean?

666
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,925
Me and you, we're the heat.

667
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,686
We go in there, interrogate her,
scare the shit out of her...

668
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,922
We don't say "interrogation".
It's too aggressive.

669
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,321
Rule number one, catch more
with sugar than with a stick.

670
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,930
That's a horrible
fucking saying.

671
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,289
We like to create a genuine
personal interest in the subject,

672
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,401
allowing them to open up.
(SIGHING)

673
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,484
Then I'll perform instant
personality assessments

674
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,971
based on
the Myers-Briggs theory...

675
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,362
...Thematic
Apperception Tests and...

676
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,726
...a few others I
won't bore you with.

677
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,371
Well, lam balls deep
in boredom.

678
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,165
All right, as long as
you don't do that

679
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,651
whole long explanation again...

680
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,490
...we'll try it
your way first.

681
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,006
Only because you're older.

682
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,320
Oh, my God.

683
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,080
Tatiana Krumova, lam Special
Agent Sarah Ashburn...

684
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,607
...and this is Detective Mullins.
Detective Mullins.

685
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,529
And we'd like to ask you a few questions
if you could give us a moment.

686
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,322
(FOREIGN ACCENT) Oh, shoot. You know, now is bad.
I'm making butter.

687
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,051
How about other time?

688
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,360
If you could just give... How
about right fucking now?

689
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,164
Right fucking now!

690
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,165
Well, Tatiana, thank you.
This is very kind of you.

691
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,561
So...

692
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,842
How long have you lived here?

693
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,043
I've lived here
since I moved in.

694
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,085
Okay, that's
very... very helpful.

695
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,562
Okay, we'll get
a little more specific.

696
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,843
What do you do for a living?

697
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,365
I know what this asshole
does for a living.

698
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,680
What you know, asshole?

699
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,001
Sugar, no stick.

700
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,924
It is Bulgarian, is it not?

701
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,605
No, I'm fucking French!

702
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,444
Oh, Jesus.
Tatiana...

703
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,291
(SPEAKING BULGARIAN)

704
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,210
I don't understand
what you are saying.

705
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,846
Nice bullshit Bulgarian.

706
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,410
That was perfect Bulgarian.

707
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,409
I mean I don't understand
what you are talking about!

708
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,847
Why I go to jail
when I don't do shits?

709
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,966
Ah! So she did understand what I
was saying, just not the context.

710
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,491
Oh, sweet God.

711
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,087
All right, Rosetta Stone,
you're done.

712
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,561
(MOANING)

713
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,005
Ugh! Oh, Jesus.

714
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,523
How many porns have been
made on this couch?

715
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,286
Oh, this couch not of your satisfaction?
You're not comfy?

716
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,442
I'll get comfy. When
my foot's up your ass.

717
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,521
Wow.

718
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,648
That'll make me really comfy.
Don't poke me!

719
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,802
Tatiana, I want to
get really real.

720
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,122
You ready to get real?
Let's get real.

721
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,847
Okay, we both know you've been
blowing shit up your nose all day.

722
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,446
Man, I get it. There's nothing
more I'd love to do than...

723
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,683
...slip into my camisole, put my
feet up, have a little smack.

724
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,928
Real good time,
maybe a couple cold ones,

725
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,048
a little chip and dip,
watch some cartoons.

726
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,203
I'd get a big bowl of coke...

727
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,761
I'd put my face in it, cut
it with a little Ritalin...

728
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,604
Heaven on fucking earth, right?
Sure.

729
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,967
I'd camp out all week
for tickets to that show.

730
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,400
What is this, Training <i>Day?</i>

731
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,926
All fucking week
I'd camp out for that!

732
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,363
But you, you piece of shit, you've
been rolling deep for a long time.

733
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,364
And now it's time you open
up that goddamn mouth

734
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,760
and tell us what
we want to know.

735
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,163
You got good point. I tell you what.
I open my mouth.

736
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,528
You get the fuck
out my house now!

737
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,330
How's that for open mouth?

738
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,965
Fuck out! Get fuck out!

739
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,530
Yeah, I'll get the fuck out.

740
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,921
All right.

741
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,926
You should really stop smoking
because it's an awfully bad habit.

742
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,080
You're leaving half your
lipstick in the ashtray.

743
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,370
I had a great aunt that lost
most of her teeth to smoking.

744
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,641
Good to know.

745
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,167
A lot of fistfights,
too, but mostly smoking.

746
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,641
We're gonna get
out of your hair.

747
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,887
That is not front door.

748
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,364
(SHRIEKS) Puty our hands
where I can see 'em!

749
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,521
Don't fucking move.

750
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,088
Is this your drug mule?
Oh, my gosh!

751
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,200
TATIANA: That's my mother!

752
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,123
Do you have balloons
of horse up your ass?

753
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,441
You break my fucking door!

754
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,806
Stand down, Officer.

755
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,769
Who closes the door
to take a shit?

756
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,805
Humans do.

757
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,645
Don't touch underpants!

758
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,127
Get out, bull in china shop!
Out of my house!

759
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,526
What the fuck's wrong with you?

760
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,124
Wow, you are just
all stick and no sugar.

761
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,811
Did you get
the cigarette or not?

762
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,120
Uh, yeah... of course I did.

763
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,481
Yeah.

764
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,247
I snagged these matches, too. I think
our guy likes to go to Club Ekko.

765
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,331
Really?
Yes, really.

766
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,604
Let's find out, shall we?

767
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,009
Hang on. The couch was disgusting.
I need to wash my hands.

768
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,843
Wait a minute,
you do live here?

769
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,645
That's what I said.

770
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,366
Oh.

771
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,203
Wow, your windows
are all boarded up.

772
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,361
Yeah, I've got the glass,

773
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,801
I just don't have the...
you know, window blankets.

774
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,002
The curtains?
You mean the curtains?

775
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,083
Whatever. Okay?

776
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,205
That's just my family.

777
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,401
ASHBURN: Oh.

778
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,482
Yeah, it's sweet.

779
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,847
You want something to eat?

780
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,361
I didn't finish my submarine
sandwich the other day.

781
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,051
No, thank you.

782
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,011
Sorry I don't have poached
eggs in rubies for you.

783
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,483
No, I don't mean
to be rude, but...

784
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,844
...one could catch a MRSA
infection in here, that's all.

785
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,570
What part of that wasn't rude?

786
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,491
Just for your own well-being.
For example, that door.

787
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,330
That door has no
way of locking.

788
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,164
Someone could barge in at any moment.
It's not safe.

789
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,322
No one's coming in here...

790
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,171
...because they know
I keep this fully stocked.

791
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,171
Oh, my God.

792
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,481
Yeah, I know.

793
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,403
A Marlin 1894CB?

794
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,409
Is that an FN PS90?

795
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,846
Yeah! Nice one.

796
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,490
You have all of this
in your house?

797
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,005
You didn't even
mention my baby.

798
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,531
Look at this.
Oh!

799
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,850
My little pride and joy.

800
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,291
This little beauty could
vaporize an above-ground pool.

801
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,249
If you didn't want
the pool anymore.

802
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,731
No kidding.
Pretty, huh?

803
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,400
Yeah. How do you refuse
that sales pitch, huh?

804
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,042
You don't.
Unless you're an asshole.

805
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,888
I haven't seen one of these
since World War ll.

806
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,566
No! God,
that... occasionally ticks.

807
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,723
Put it back slowly.
Slowly!

808
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,929
Like half that speed.

809
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,204
Half that speed!

810
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,042
Stop shaking.
Put your pinky down.

811
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,326
I got it on eBay. It was supposed
to be bigger and different.

812
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,401
It doesn't matter.

813
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,801
I'm gonna "Bad Feedback"
his ass, though.

814
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,921
LEVY; All right, ladies.

815
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,844
Here's the DNA results
from the book of matches

816
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,922
and the cigarette butt
you got from Tatiana's.

817
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,448
We pulled two sets of prints.
First one's a real nut job.

818
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,923
Look at this. Reckless
driving, assault, arson.

819
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,606
Oh, God.
Ahem! Really?

820
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,922
Who the fuck is this guy?
He's my assistant.

821
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,122
You know I'm an agent, right?
Arson?

822
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,850
It was a drug house!
(WHISTLES)

823
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,844
I really feel the need
to finish reading your files.

824
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,684
I feel the need for you to
stay out of my business

825
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,364
so I don't punch
you in the teeth.

826
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,529
What did you find out
about the cigarette?

827
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,205
Okay. Hank LeSoire.

828
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,361
Local businessman.

829
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,442
Got tons of ties to the
drug world, black market...

830
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,484
...as well as prostitution rings.
Co-owner of Club Ekko.

831
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,849
It looks like we found our distributor.
Can you back that up, please?

832
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,490
Back up to which one?
That.

833
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,047
I'm not into you!

834
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,400
Your breast is
invading my space.

835
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,449
Keep your finger
out of my areola.

836
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,324
Contain your areola!

837
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,290
MULLINS: There. Now we're even.
(SIGHS)

838
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,805
He looks like a real Chatty Cathy.
Did you tap the phone?

839
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,721
LEVY: I haven't been able to. Guy
gets a new prepaid every other week.

840
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,205
By the time I can
get his phone number

841
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,685
and hack in,
he's got a new one.

842
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,047
Let's get a bug into the
phone he does have.

843
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,326
I want to know what
he's saying this week.

844
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,681
Just get a court order and a bug.
We'll do it ourselves.

845
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,200
If you're gonna boss me around,
at least buy me dinner first.

846
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,243
No.
Okay. Cool.

847
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,209
I'll get that to you ASAP.

848
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,806
You got to work on your game.
That was weak.

849
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,361
What? I thought I
was being charming.

850
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,486
I don't know what to say to that.
Now I just feel bad for you.

851
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,527
Okay, so LeSoire
co-owns Club Ekko.

852
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,003
Let's start surveilling it and figure
out how to get a bug in his phone.

853
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,366
Tell me everything
you know about it.

854
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,720
It's just
a shitty club downtown.

855
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,330
I've never been inside,

856
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,006
but there's always a line of
awful people around the corner.

857
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,527
They've called P.D. a couple
times to break up fights.

858
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,170
Oh, shit.
What's wrong?

859
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,523
Just don't look. Don't look!

you're like a fucking nanny!

Picture time!

1030
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,802
Damn it. Can somebody
get my phone?

1031
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,048
ASHBURN: I got it!
I got it! Let go!

1032
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,364

Stop it! Stop it!

1037
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,925
I will fucking kill you.

Where is he?

1039
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,363
Get in there.
Okay, one more time.

1040
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,601

LeSOIRE Hello.
ASHBURN: Hi.

1043
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,884
Your moves are weird
as shit... and I love it.

1044
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,451
You have really soft hair.

1045
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,045
Oh, yeah,
it's the shampoo move!

1046

MULLINS: Use your boobs!

1047
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,084
You see these?
Oh, God, yeah.

What's going on? Whoa!

Oh, God, back it in.
Whoa, please!

1053

Hi.
Hi.

1054
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,006
You're the first chick over
forty to give me a boner.

1055
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,441
Great.

1056
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,767
Want to go get a drink?

1057
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,569
Okay. Yeah.

1058
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,964
Maybe. Maybe.

1059
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,443
That's the only reason
girls hit on me.

1060
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,681
Oh, sorry, yeah.

1061
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,922
Every night, the hottest
chicks come in here.

1062
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,448
They're like, "There's LeSoire!"
Short skirts, too much makeup.

1063
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,125
Looking like fucking gremlins.

1064
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,440
Oh, I hate that!

1065
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,769
Don't feed them after midnight, right?
They turn into more sluts.

1066
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,885
Give me a whiskey.

1067
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,770
I just noticed that lion.

1068
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,450
That is amazing.
Fuck!

1069
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,126
Who the fuck keeps putting
lions in the back?

1070
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,921
Fourteen dollars.

1071
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,081
Fourteen dollars?

1072
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,082
Is it magic fucking whiskey?

1073
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,403
Do I get a motorcycle with it?
Is it served in Jesus's shoe?

1074
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,761
Can I sit in your lap?

1075
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,921
Obviously.

1076
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,281
I like where this is going.

1077

1078
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,561

It's my shift.

I have to say that
was pretty awesome.

It really was. Put her there.
Put her there!

I was that good.

I just thought you
were an assassin.

Because of your... weapon.

00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,649
I'm the one that
put him in jail.

1198
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,401
Okay, never mind.

1199
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,362
It's not like I liked doing it.

1200
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,245
He got mixed up with a lot
of really bad people.

1201
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,891
And then he started...

1202
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,564
He started using that shit. I
just had to get him out of there.

1203
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,084
You know, ironically, a lot
of people become addicted...

1204
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,846
...when they're in prison.
I think it's like...

1205
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,243
...80%-85% of the inmates
require treatments.

1206
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,447
I hate you.

1207
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,726
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

1208
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,049
But I actually wasn't finished.
I was going to say...

1209
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,928
Why can't you just be quiet?

1210
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,761
(SNIPPING)

1211
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,161
What the F?

1212
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,443
These are cloth.
They're nice.

1213
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,284
I could have shot you!

1214
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,165
Oh, I'm sorry, do you not like
someone invading your privacy?

1215
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,803
Oh, come on. I glanced at your file.
You broke into my home!

1216
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,122
I care about who
I'm working with, too.

1217
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,362
And it's a little uncomfortable

1218
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,363
that you feel the need
to travel with trophies.

1219
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,045
It's not what you think.

1220
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,567
They moved me up here,
rented this apartment,

1221
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,880
and that is all my stuff.

1222
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,681
These four shitty, sad boxes... this is it?
This is your life?

1223
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,961
Yes.

1224
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,844
Oh, God. I don't think that
could be any sadder if you...

1225
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,490
...threw it all
in the trash bag

1226
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,210
and started
dragging it behind you.

1227
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,450
You use coffee filters for
toilet paper at your house.

1228
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,602
I'm buying them anyway.
They have a dual purpose.

1229
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,325
That's not what they're for.

1230
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,324
Yeah, real fancy-pants.
I see it. I see it in here.

1231
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,682
Looks like you were pretty
cool in high school, huh?

1232
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,286
Yes. Yes, I was.
But what...

1233
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,811
Because you weren't.

1234
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,242
You know what that girl's not?
That girl's not cool.

1235
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,721
My favorite part is you
only have two signatures...

1236
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,410
...both by teachers.

1237
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,366
Mrs. Burke said, "Have a good
summer." That's a personal touch.

1238
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,689
My real favorite is this one.

1239
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,284
"It'll get better."

1240
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,011
Yes, fine.

1241
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,204
Okay, now we're even.

1242
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,041
Okay-

1243
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,645
I see you have a cat.

1244
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,521
Yep-

1245
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,767
Is he around? Because I'd like
to, you know, pet him and stuff.

1246
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,642
He... ran away, uh,
when I was in New York.

1247
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,246
(EXHALES)

1248
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,681
Oh, God, that
kind of tears me up.

1249
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,481
Yeah, it was,
um... it was a loss.

1250
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,447
That cat got one look
at your shitty life

1251
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,921
and said,
"No fucking thanks, man...

1252
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,563
am outta here!"

1253
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,005
I'm still kind of just grieving
a little bit about it.

1254
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,123
That fucking tabby is an
asshole, that's what he is.

1255
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,725
FUCK you!

1256
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,686
Yeah, "Fuck you!" That's what I
say to that cat. Goddamn it.

1257
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,486
Such a shitty,
shitty little life.

1258
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,564
You can't even keep a cat.

1259
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,444
(THUMPING)
That hurts a little bit.

1260
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,563
That's just the grief.
No, not the grief.

1261
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,246
It's just the pounding
a little bit.

1262
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,723
Oh. All right.
Don't be a dick about it.

1263
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,285
Thank you for that.

1264
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,881
All right, let's
hit the road, okay?

1265
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,730
I've got to change.

1266
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,729
What's the matter
with your pantsuit?

1267
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,004
It's pajamas.

1268
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,163
Well, excuse
the shit out of me,

1269
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,561
I didn't realize you
slept in a fucking tux.

1270
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,644
Go ahead, get your top hat.

1271
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,320

Hey, pork Chop.

00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,402
Well, well, well.
Look who it is!

1279
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,604
The rat's back in the house. Did you
come back to arrest somebody else?

1280
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,963
You know, I saw Ma throw a can of Diet
Coke in the garbage the other day.

1281
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,645
She didn't recycle it!

1282
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,043
Dad here, he's splicing cable
off the neighbors next door.

1283
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,287
Come on now, Mark.

1284
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,880
MARK: Maybe you should
fingerprint him.

1285
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,922
Maybe get yourself
some stripes!

1286
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,650

1287

you download illegally
off the Internet? 5,000?

Ten, twenty thousand.
MARK: 20,000!

Mikey just stole
a laptop from his work!

Stole? I fucking worked there for six weeks.
I deserved to take it.

1291
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,962
Exactly. No health insurance.
That balances out.

1292

But not you... you'll probably
call in the SWAT team!

1293
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,007
Actually, she could, because
those are horrible examples.

her own brother in jail?

This kind of animal... right here!
Shut up.

00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,841
How about keeps him
from killing himself?

1299

got him off the street.

strangle her at the table!

She is my best friend! You touch
her, you gotta go through me first.

I'll kill you, and kill her
with your fucking dead body!

Everybody calm down.
Shannon's right.

"This one?" Why are you talking
about my girlfriend like that?

She wears sweatpants
to your mother's dinner!

Those are her
classy sweatpants.

I hope not.

How do you know I was there?

1331
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,047
I know everything. Are you already
working for those guys again?

1332
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,521
No, this guy Julian,
he sent for me

1333
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,290
because he wants me
to start working with him.

1334
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,966
But I told him no, I'm getting
a straight job, and it's fine.

Everybody's cool now.
We parted amicably.

know what that is.

"knock", but apparently there's a C.

1363
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,481
I don't know anything.

1364
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,406
(SCREAMS)

1365
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,522
Okay. Sal Natale.

1366
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,162
Okay?
You know Sal Natale?

1367
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,527
Of course I do.

1368
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,444
He was gonna steal
this huge shipment

1369
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,249
they got coming in,
so they popped him.

1370
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,051
He's in the trunk of his Caddy
under the Charles River Bridge.

1371
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,281
I want you to stay
in this house.

1372
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,886
If I catch you outside, I'll
hurt you worse than them.

1373
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,690
PETER: What are you?
Why are you here?

1374
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,002
I'm a federal agent.
I'm a Special Agent.

1375
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,531
Special, like retarded?

1376
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,407
We don't use that word.
We say "special needs".

1377
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,171
But I have a very high IQ.

1378
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,930
Are you a boy or a girl?

1379
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,571
That's a fair question.

1380
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,250
Uh, I'm... I'm female.

1381
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,681
No kidding.

1382
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,046
All woman!

1383
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,442
From the get-go?
No operation?

1384
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,766
Um...

1385
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,080
(CAR UNLOCKS) From birth, yes.

1386
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,360
How you get that close a shave
on your face? (HONKING)

1387
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,561
I need to go, but I'll be back to, um...
(CAR STARTING)

1388
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,563
PETER: Nice knowing you.
Yeah, thank you.

1389
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,928
MULLINS: Yep, that's
Sal Natale, all right.

1390
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,567
Bullet hole through the head. That's
unusually civilized for them.

1391
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,564
Oh, they cut out his tongue, too.
Ah.

1392
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,406
There you have it. They
like to send a message.

1393
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,444
Did you find the tongue? Sure.

1394
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,244
Shoved it up his anal cavity.

1395
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,130
That's a weird message.

1396
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,360
The tip of the tongue was
sticking out of the rectum.

1397
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,130
So it made it appear
as if his buttocks

1398
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,804
were giving the police
the raspberry.

1399
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,765
Did they draw googly eyes or
anything on his butt cheeks?

1400
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,921
No.

1401
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,445
Seems like kind of an opportunity missed.
That would have been funny.

1402
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,924
Well, I feel that they were just
trying to be tongue in cheek.

1403
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,209
God, don't do that.

1404
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,202
(CLEARS THROAT)
Where are his belongings?

1405
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,282
Any clues as to where
the body was killed?

1406
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,442
We're still looking
for their base camp.

1407
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,489
Well, if there's
anything on him

1408
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,284
that will tell us,
I will find it.

1409
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,040
ASHBURN: Huh. MULLINS:
Is that coke?

1410
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,641
I don't think so.
It's more like a coating.

1411
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,121
Same traces found
on all the victims' shoes.

1412
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,810
All of them had...
Epoxy powder coating.

1413
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,881
Right?

1414
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,041
That's right.

1415
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,804
Each sample was made of the same ingredient.
Which means...

1416
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,491
They were all
killed same place.

1417
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,641
Exactly.

1418
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,085
I checked it out Wow.

1419
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,163
There are three places that
have this kind of powder.

1420
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,322
Paint factory!
Yeah.

1421
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,404
We all know that.
Well, it's...

1422
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,085
Look at this.

1423
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,402
This one right here is
centered in the location...

1424
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,086
Where all four dead
bodies were found!

1425
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,323
Right.
That's what I thought.

1426
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,891
This one shut down years ago,

1427
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,291
owned by a man by
the name of Lief Sa...

1428
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,930
Sambertineson?
Sagglemint?

1429
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,446
Samber...?
Old Sagglemint.

1430
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,761
Santino.

1431
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,922
Oh, Santino!
Santino... Sanfino.

1432
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,444
Is that a derivative
of Sagglemint?

1433
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,762
Get me the address
to that paint factory ASAP.

1434
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,365
Excuse me, Ashburn? Um...

1435
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,091
I was wondering...

1436
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,850
(MUTTERS SOFTLY) Oh. This
is a little awkward.

1437
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,600
Uh, it's nothing personal, but
as a rule I make it a point...

1438
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,206
...not to date my
co-workers, so... thank you.

1439
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,204
I was wondering if you would
not talk to me in that tone.

1440
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,968
Oh! Yes, of course!

1441
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,884
That's a little different.

1442
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,451
I wouldn't.
Why would I?

1443
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,050
Why would you? Really.

1444
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,124
We should go to
the paint factory.

1445
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,284
Are we clear here? Because
it got real awkward.

1446
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,568
No... I think we're all good.
Right?

1447
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,370
Uh... ASHBURN:
We're really good.

1448
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,487
Same page.

1449
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,880
Because I don't want any bad...

1450
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,126
ASHBURN: We're all good.
Here we go.

1451
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,805
Let's go to the paint factory.

1452
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,406
She doesn't want to date
co-workers, so spread the word.

1453
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,641
Shut up.

1454
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,043
<i>Caught my man cheating Now I'm
rolling through the west side</i>

1455
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,771
<i>'Bout to burn this fucking
house down like I'm Left Eye</i>

1456
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,807
<i>Rest in peace</i>

1457
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,211
<i>Like I'm Left Eye Rest in peace</i>

1458
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,486
<i>Like I'm Left Eye</i>

1459
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,530
<i>'Bout to burn this motherfucker
down like I'm Left Eye</i>

1460
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,968
<i>Heard my man is cheating with
another bitch at my house</i>

1461
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,210
What is that shit?

1462
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,601
Stop it.

1463
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,081
(WHISPERING) Just cover
me and go right.

1464
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,525
Well, then say that.

1465
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,728
You make me want to shoot you.

1466
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,682
JULIAN: I don't know what your
problem is, but we told you...

1467
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,683
stay out of the city.

1468
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,648
I don't know what it is. Are you deaf?
Do you not speak English?

1469
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,443
I got to do something
with you, man.

1470
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,282
Look, Jullian...
I'm sorry.

1471
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,602
I'll sell for you guys.
Whatever you want me to do.

1472
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,681
I'm just trying to
make some extra money.

1473
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,643
You can't blame
me for that, right?

1474
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,962
Relax.
I totally get it.

1475
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,122
Thank you. I'm not
gonna shoot you.

1476
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,282
Okay. It's cool, man. Thanks.

1477
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,283
He is.
Wait! Hold on!

1478
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,326
(SIGHS) (WHISPERING) Shit!

1479
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,211
(WHISPERING) If we grab Julian,
I can get into his head.

1480
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,486
We'll have Larkin by tonight.

1481
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,085
Two against two.
I like those odds.

1482
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,400
I'll call for backup.

1483
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,285
(WHISPERING) It's already here.

1484
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,765
Oh, hey!

1485
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,209
I was looking for you. Um, I
forgot to get your number.

1486
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,682
Cool. It's, uh,
1-800-Give Me Your Fucking Guns.

1487
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:03,167
That's, uh...
too many numbers.

1488
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,122
I met these disasters at
the club the other night.

1489
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,124
Now they're both here.

1490
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,760
You think you
might have been bugged?

1491
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,651
Give me a break.

1492
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,765
What the fuck?

1493
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,769
Think you're hot shit?
Guess what.

1494
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,569
You guys look even
older in this lighting!

1495
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,251
Come on.
Fuck you.

1496
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,683
Fuck you! It's not fuck me.
It's fuck you.

1497
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,248
You know why? Because I'm
about to fuck you up.

1498
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,801
Pick it up.

1499
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,840
Do it. Give me a reason
to shoot you in the face.

1500
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,481
How long will this take?

1501
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,290
Maybe 12 hours, hopefully less.

1502
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,964
I have to find out
what drives him.

1503
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,884
We could just beat him
with a phonebook.

1504
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,804
No! For so many
reasons, no.

1505
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,325
You just need to be
patient, all right?

1506
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,449
It is crucial that
you remain patient.

1507
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,200
It's also crucial that you stop
wearing this stupid barrette.

1508
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,044
Don't! Just leave it.

1509
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,168
Why? You have one on your head.

1510
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,208
Yeah, on top of my head,
like a normal person.

1511
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,402
What is the difference?
Just move on.

1512
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,285
If you enter that room, you could
break the bond we have created.

1513
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,920
Okay? Just please, please
trust me on this one.

1514
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,923
Do you understand
how important this is?

1515
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,365
Yeah, I do.

1516
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,245
And you will be patient?

1517
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:24,881
I will.

1518
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,365
Okay. All right.

1519
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,721
Hello.

1520
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,121
Coffee?

1521
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,124
I drink a little more coffee
than I probably should.

1522
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,681
Where's Larkin?

1523
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,489
You couldn't wait ten seconds?

1524
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,961
What's so funny?

1525
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,202
You... thinking you're
going to make me talk.

1526
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,448
You're talking
right now, dumb-ass!

1527
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,360
You look like one of
the Campbell's soup kids

1528
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,084
who grew up and
became an alcoholic.

1529
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,449
Oh, surprisingly catty.
You're a fucking genius.

you to stay outside!

go tough on him.

1532

Are you not already doing that?

1533
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,005
No! I'm doing
good cop, bad cop.

1534
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,361
You know, I can hear you.

1535
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,521
Shut up!

(SIGHS)

1537
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,321
Just please,
don't do anything crazy.

1538
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,164
I won't do anything crazy.

1539
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,808
What am I gonna do that's crazy?
I'm a police officer. Huh?

1540
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,490
(GUN CLICKS) Am I gonna
shoot you in the dick?

1541
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,484
You said nothing crazy,
and that is a no-no!

1542
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,561
No-no!

1543
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,409
Turn around. I need you
to pass a polygraph.

1544
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,250
Put it away!
Turn around!

1545

Don't worry, she won't do it.
She won't do anything.

1546
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,243
So you want to gamble with your
scrotum and your testicles?

1547
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,606
Okay, gamble away!

1548
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,801
Just go to the corner!

01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,881
I'm in it!

I'll tell you what we're gonna do...
play a little game.

1551
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,330
I'm gonna take
out these bullets.

1552
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,167
Except this one. Because
this is my favorite.

1553
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,480
I'm gonna keep that in there.

1554
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,409
And then you're gonna
tell me where Larkin is.

1555
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,603
And you're gonna
tell me when and where

1556
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,682
that shipment is coming in.
Okay?

1557
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,641
Right now.

1558
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,448

That's not what I asked.

Straight arrow,
take the gun from her!

Where?
I don't know!

(GUN CLICKS) I swear
to God, I don't know!

1568
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,284
Tell her! Just tell
her where it is!

1569
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,970
Don't shoot me in the dick!

1570
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,242
I don't know! It's gonna be Wednesday!
That's four shots!

Don't take any more shots!

Just tell her
where it's coming in!

I don't know! Don't
shoot me in the dick!

(GUN CLICKS)
Enough! Stop it!

1575
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,484
You brought
Julian and LeSoire in?

You out of your minds?
Wasn't too smart.

1577
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,404
Oh. So you're not supposed
to arrest someone

1578
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,528
when they commit murder
and try and kill you?

1579
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,162
You wanted us to
keep them on the street?

1580
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,362
You shouldn't
even have been there!

1581
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,522
Larkin is the big catch,
not those two!

1582
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,364
Now we're never
gonna be able to...

1583
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,124
Craig! Calm down!
We can all hear you.

1584
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,691
Yeah, dogs can hear you.

1585
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,211
Of course dogs can hear me!

you look really pale.

one because I'm really white!

with my agent, please?

be right over there.

Thank you.

1596
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,564
Why didn't you alert anyone

1597
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,520
once you found evidence
of Julian's whereabouts?

1598
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,244
It was an unconfirmed lead.

I wasn't gonna waste anyone's
time until I knew it was real.

1600

Give it a rest. I want
you to stand down...

repair all this shit with the DEA.

01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,566
everything you sent
me out here to do.

1604
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,046
We've been doing
such good work.

1605
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,088
I know you are.

1606
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,401
It's just...

1607
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,648
I don't know, it's... never
easy when you are involved.

1608
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,771
Fuck that guy.

1609
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,640
If you're not in trouble,
you're not doing your job.

1610
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:48,961
Yeah.

1611
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,929
We should go get a drink. Right?

1612
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,611
What's the point of being a cop

if you can't get one drink
at the end of the night?

1614

That's what I'm talking about!

1615
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,131
I said I just want one.

1616
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,403
Oh, no, no, here...
it is one.

1617

to do this thing where...

1618
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,681
...he pours them in three
little glasses, but it's one.

01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,011

I haven't heard from you.

1629
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,811

01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,323
No, you haven't.

1631
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,007
Well, did I do
something wrong, or...

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

1633
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,767
Okay, here we go.

Uh, I'm still
working on myself.

1636

until I'm a better one.

1637
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,411
You don't have to do that.

1638
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,766
Oh, wait.
My favorite's coming.

1639
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,081
Oh.

1640
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,527
You make me want to
be a better woman.

1641
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,251
I thought we had a good time.

1642
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,003
We did have a lot of fun.
And now we're gonna move on.

1643
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,850

1644
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,365

Bye.

1648
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,964
I didn't know how else to say it.
It's pretty clear.

1649
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,290
That's why you
don't feed strays.

1650
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,131
Can we get two more...

1651
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,966
...shots?

1652
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,361

few more of these, right?

(ASHBURN SIGHS)

1655
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,684
ASHBURN: I don't know, Mullins.
It's hard.

1656
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,810
I know we're not
supposed to say this,

1657
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,326
but being a woman
in this field is hard.

1658
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,726
Men are just so intimidated
by me, which is like... why?

1659
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,166
And then you put your personality
on top of that and it is...

1660
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,965
...it is off-putting.

1661
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,522
You know, I was actually
married for six some years.

1662
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,450
Was he a hearing man?
Yes.

1663
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,043
He didn't understand how
much the job meant to me,

1664
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,804
so I thought it'd
be best to just...

1665
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,765
...be alone rather than
to compromise the work.

1666
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,331
I get that.

1667
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,086
It's kind of weird that it does
get lonely... a little bit.

1668
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,607
It's hard to
make female friends.

1669
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,842
I hung out, you know...

1670
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,527
...really just with my brothers
and stuff growing up and...

1671
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,525
...they just all turned out
to be terrible people.

1672
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,761
So that's kind of a bummer.

1673
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,042
Your family loves you.

1674
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,206
I mean,
in their own unique way,

1675
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,203
but they love you and
that's a wonderful...

1676
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,361
Very unique.

1677
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,931
That sounds like
it's coming from

1678
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,684
(CHUCKLES) somebody
that's an only child.

1679
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:52,804
No, I was actually raised
with a lot of children.

1680
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,162
Other children?
What, in a circus?

1681
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,283
No, just in...
in the houses.

1682
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,329
Oh, my God.

1683
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,684
You're a foster kid.

1684
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,801
Yes, I was.

1685
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,211
Oh, my God.

1686
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,442
No. Jesus, that clears up a lot.

1687
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,364
Foster kid. That makes sense.
That's a tough go of it.

1688
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,847
No, it was totally fine.

1689
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,720
There was a lot of benefits
to being a foster kid.

1690
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,529
Yeah?
Yeah.

1691
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,683
On Christmases, there was
this local drugstore

1692
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,244
that would sponsor us and give us
little baggies of toiletries and stuff.

1693
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:34,327
On Thanksgiving, we would hit these
different putt putt golf courses.

1694
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,411
You'd meet all kinds of...
Other sad kids?

1695
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,403
No...
Oh, Jesus.

1696
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,004
That's the saddest series
of images I've ever heard.

1697

01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,680
Hi. Can I drive?

1867
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,921
No, but if you could
make your way around...

1868
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,526
Get out and let me drive.
I'm a really good driver!

1869
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,445
Mullins! Your mom.

1870
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,763
Our lives are in danger. I
may have to change my name.

1871
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,125
So if you get a call from
someone named Carla, it's me!

1872
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,930
When did you become
such a princess?

1873
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,047
MULLINS:
You make it impossible!

1874
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,690
All right, seatbelts, everyone!

1875
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,530
Come on, buddy...
come on.

1876
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:50,886
Right here, buddy!
Right here!

1877
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,041
What the fuck is this?

1878
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,770
That's my puppy. I got
him four months ago.

1879
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,285
I named him Kevin Garnett.

1880
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,441
You're an asshole!

1881
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,010
You gotta see
the cock on this thing.

1882
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,763
Move. We're not bringing this
fucking horse to a motel.

1883
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,729
We gotta get Gina.
For what?

1884
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,723
Because you put her
fucking life in danger!

1885
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,291
Nobody gives a shit about her.

1886
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,891
If I'm going, Gina's going!

1887
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,041
I'm not going
unless we get Gina.

1888
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,121
Just get in.

1889
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,321
We're getting Gina.

1890
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,721
Move your feet,
I'll chop 'em off!

1891
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,883
We're going to Gina's!

1892
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,246
MULLINS: I hope a truck
hits us and we all die.

1893
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,402
What the fuck is
this girl doing?

1894
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:30,845
Could she go any slower? Could
she physically go slower?

1895
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,206
MRS. MULLINS:
Go get your girlfriend.

1896
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,520
PETER:
She's fine, Ma!

1897
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,002
I forgot my curling
iron, Mrs. Mullins!

1898
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,003
Come on, Gina, get in the car!

1899
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,241
What the fuck?

1900
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,165
I got you the rollie so you could roll the bag!
So get over here!

1901
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,367
You kidding?

1902
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,566
You bought me
a bag for Christmas

1903
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,080
so that I could
carry my own luggage?

1904
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,844
Gina, come on...
let's go.

1905
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,760
I'm gonna get you
a dick-sucker for Christmas

1906
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,926
so I don't have to
do it no more.

1907
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,082
MRS. MULLINS: Go get her!
Jesus! I'm going!

1908
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,600
Gina! You really
didn't say that.

1909
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:55,721
Oh, that's why you're here.

1910
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,801
MRS. MULLINS:
Go get her.

1911
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,326
Come on, Pete, just break
up with this girl!

1912
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,720
Let's go, let's go!

1913
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,240
You're making a scene,
you assholes!

1914
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,721
You think you're man enough?
You fucking man enough?

1915
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,851
Knock it off!
Just knock it off!

1916
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,411
I got this!

1917
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,370
Hey! Assholes!

1918
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:14,006
Get in the car! Get in the car!
Get in the car!

1919
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,645
Did she just pull out a gun?

1920
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,685
You know what happens now?
You don't get this one!

1921
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:22,531
So, Jason,
your family seems nice.

1922
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,842
Yeah, we have our good days.

1923
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,371
My make-up is
in that one.

1924
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,290
I'll rip your pants off!

1925
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,561
(ALL ARGUING)

1926
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,407
If we just knew where that
shipment was coming to,

1927
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,970
we would have
Larkin and Julian.

1928
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,322
They would both be there,
and we could get them.

1929
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,205
I'm just happy that Jason
is out of there for now.

1930
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,561
Yeah.

1931
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,607
Shame, though.

1932
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,251
Having your brother on the
inside would be a coup for us.

1933
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,521
That's what you want to say?

1934
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,766
Because you're
saying that out loud.

1935
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,924
You would say exactly the same
thing if it wasn't your brother.

1936
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,411
We're done talking about this.

1937
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,244
So if it was just
some random drug dealer,

1938
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,520
you wouldn't send him back in?

1939
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,284
If it was someone like Rojas

1940
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,089
We're not talking about Rojas.

1941
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,447
We're talking about my
brother, you fuckwit.

1942
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,251
We all have a lot to lose
if we don't catch Larkin.

1943
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,440
What do you have to lose?

1944
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,481
I have a lot.

1945
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,130
Some bullshit promotion?

1946
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,283
You don't give
a shit about my family

1947
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,691
or if Jason gets out
there and gets killed.

1948
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,524
I feel you're not being honest.

1949
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:25,763
Because nobody forced your brother
to get involved with drugs.

1950
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,046
You're an asshole for that.

1951
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,849
Okay, that's not
helping, either.

1952
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,451
I'm trying to
create a dialogue.

1953
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,046
Note that I start my
statements with "I feel".

1954
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,123
Oh, I feel like
you're an asshole.

1955
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,441
You know what I feel?

1956
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,807
I feel that you have worn that
shirt every day this week.

1957
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,803
And I feel that you
turning it inside out

1958
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,040
does not make it a new shirt.

1959
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,531
Well, I feel like it does

1960
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,722
Oh, really? Well, I
feel I disagree.

1961
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,326
Must be nice.
What?

1962
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:50,006
Must be really nice
for you to know everything.

1963
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,202
To be so much smarter
than everybody else.

1964
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,960
I don't profess to know everything,
but I do know quite a bit.

1965
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,080
What I know is accurate
and scientifically proven,

1966
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,724
and I share that
information with you.

1967
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,006

a problem with that,

1968
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,724
tune me out like you always do.

Help! He's choking!

1970
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:05,810
Okay, I've got it.

1971
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,969
Somebody call an ambulance!

1972
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,045
Check his mouth!

1973
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,043
There's nothing there!
Okay, lay him down.

1974
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,362
Sir, relax.
Everything will be fine.

1975
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,284
Let me get his head back.

1976
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,284
He's choking. I need a
knife and a straw, please!

1977
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,886
A knife and a straw!
Why a knife and a straw?

1978
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,042
I'm going to perform
an emergency tracheotomy.

1979
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,281
I'll need a glass of vodka.

1980
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,090
Vodka! It's a Denny's!

1981
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,605

Technically, no...

1984
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,649
...but I've been
doing some research

1985
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,802
and I feel fairly
confident I know how.

1986
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,366
He's still choking!

1987
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,041
Sir, what I'm going
to do is find your...

1988
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,200
Please don't put that in there.
Shh. Stop touching me.

1989
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,603
I think the cricothyroid membrane is here.
I'll make a small incision...

1990
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,444
Let go of my hand.
Please don't do that.

1991
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,329
I'm going to make
a small incision.

1992
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:52,280
The reason I'm doing this...
is because you're choking.

1993
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,165
I'm gonna cut in... just a
little bigger... (RETCHING)

1994

deeper than I thought.

1995

Now I'm going to
insert my fingers.

1996
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,331
Don't put your finger in there!

1997
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,727
There is the membrane.

1998
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:06,645
It's a fucking horror show! Don't
put your fingers in there!

1999
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:10,243
Sir, what I'm going to do is
insert the straw in the hole...

2000
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,607
...and it will allow the
oxygen to get to your brain.

2001
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,929
In one moment, you will feel the
oxygen flow into your brain.

2002
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,804
That's not oxygen.

2003
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,450

01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,085

You did this!

01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,485
When's the ambulance coming?

2009
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,766
I got it! Move!

should amputate it?

01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,611
It's almost there.

2373
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:19,166
Got it!

2374
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:20,446
Hurry up, hurry UP-

2375

2376
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,005
What?
Somebody's coming up.

2377
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,890
Got to put it back in. What?

2378
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,411
I got to put it back in.

2379
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:28,965
And I'll put my hands
behind my back.

2380
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,485
When he gets close,
I'll grab him.

2381
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,404
But you got to shut up
and let me put it back in.

2382
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,800
Okay, just put it in.

2383
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,401
What are you doing?

2384
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,010
Sorry, it doesn't
go in that easy.

2385
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,321
Just shut up!

keep my hands tied.

be happy to see you guys.

2392

to the hospital.

2393

Did you guys call this in?

2394
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,044
Yeah, I sent a fucking
owl with a note.

2395

How did you even
know we were here?

2396
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:02,761
We followed you.

2397
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,365
I knew you wouldn't
give up easily,

2398

greased your shitbag brother.

2399

Fuck you. It takes a lot more than
Larkin to take down a Mullins.

2400

Jason's not dead?

2401
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,524
Come on, Adam.
Larkin is on his way.

2402
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,682
What is this, a Q and A?
Can we do this later?

2403
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:18,207
Wait. Did he talk to the police?
Did he see Larkin?

2404
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,886
How is she supposed to know? He's
been in a coma. Untie my leg.

2405
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:23,805
That's too bad. Where is he?
Is he at Boston General?

2406
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:24,961

him fucking flowers?

2410

You guys are
working with Larkin.

2411

I really wish you
hadn't said that.

2412

2415

It wasn't the albino.
I feel bad.

2416
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,604
He wasn't working for Larkin.

2417
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:46,170
He just wanted you off the case

2418
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,691
'cause he's
a misogynistic asshole.

2419
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,924
Why are you doing this? You
getting some kind of payoff?

2420
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:52,610
I was in the beginning.

2421
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,729
Six years dealing
with these lowlifes,

2422
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,450
making shit money...
Ah!

2423
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,081
You're Larkin.

2424
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,401
Holy shit.

2425
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:01,727
Ta-da!

2426
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,485
Get it? Right?
Makes perfect sense!

2427
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:08,885
Now I'm bragging, but it's very
nice having a second income.

2428
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,884
I heard shots.
What the...?

2429

Aw, the albino.
That guy was hilarious!

2430
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:16,202
Boss, I don't think that
was such a good idea.

2431
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,801
You spend three years in a van
with him, you'd kill him, too.

2432

We'll pin it on LeSoire.

hospital to finish Jason.

Mmm-hmm.

Is that clean?

It's clean enough.

several people died on here.

Just flip me.

All right! I'll wait
right here for you!

I drove all the way
to New Jersey,

2633
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,287
and I was up and down these
streets, looking all over.

I was just about to give up,

and I was over
by your old place,

and suddenly I hear
this little bell.

in your neighbor's window...

sitting right on the couch.

to go back with her."

could make this reuniting.

(VOCALIZING)

2711
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:01,560
<i>Like the blood
running through my veins</i>

2712
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:04,325
<i>This is my DNA and my chemistry</i>

2713
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:07,646

<i>See the smoke
coming out my ears?</i>

2719
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:26,131
<i>Oh, won't you
come into my head?</i>

2720
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:29,046
<i>Come inside,
lie down in my head?</i>

2721

come into my head?</i>

2722

up in my head</i>

a piece of my mind?</i>

2724
