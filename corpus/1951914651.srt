00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,246
Can I have a shot glass, please?

2
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,873
<i>Photo sent.</i>

3
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,914
<i>Stay on this heading for about 6h30min.</i>

4
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:21,614
<i>Turn left at the
Aurora Borealis.</i>

5
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:24,986
<i>When you see something that looks like
a frozen gall bladder, that's Greenland.</i>

6
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:26,163
<i>Hang a soft right there.</i>

7
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,502
<i>- All set there, Mr. Hauser?
- Yeah, thank you.</i>

8
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:30,965
<i>Guidestar!</i>

9
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,673
<i>Guidestar!</i>

10
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:49,909
<i>Welcome back.</i>

11
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:53,022
<i>Hotel? Dinner reservations?
Movie tickets, maybe?</i>

12
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,492
<i>Mr. Hauser
Is there something else you need?</i>

13
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,467
I don't know.
I feel...

14
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:05,573
<i>Go on.</i>

15
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,580
Like a refuge from the
Island of Dr. Moreau.

16
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,383
Some morally inverted, twisted
character from a Céline novel.

17
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:15,731
The hot sauce helps.

18
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:17,970
<i>You still getting those
nightmares you told me about?</i>

19
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,924
They're coming back faster and faster. I
don't know if I can keep outrunning 'em.

20
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,881
That'll be it, Jerry.
I gotta go.

21
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,582
<i>You bet, Mr. Hauser. GuideStar
wants you to feel secure.</i>

22
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:30,660
<i>GuideStar.</i>

23
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,237
Be still my trembling hands,
for how you would tremble...

24
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,500
if you knew where I
would take you next.

25
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,175
<i>Incoming message.</i>

26
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,547
<i>Incoming message.</i>

27
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,077
<i>You got him on the comm there?
Bring it over.</i>

28
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:49,788
<i>Hello, Hauser!</i>

29
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,337
Hello, Mr. Vice President.

30
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:53,573
I haven't been vice president
for five months.

31
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:55,560
Otherwise, this all might
be a conflict of interest.

32
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,148
Tamerlane and the U.S. government,
and I in particular, were cleared...

33
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:02,724
<i>of any and all violations of federal,
state and international laws...</i>

34
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,680
<i>by the bipartisan committee.</i>

35
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,295
Just read the report.

36
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,522
I'm sure anything you weren't supposed
to be doing you were cleared of.

37
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:12,510
And of course I was preemptively
pardoned by the president.

38
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,741
I got the snapshots.
Love your work.

39
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,339
- We're all big fans.
- Yes.

40
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,902
Let's see if the
damn Krauts...

41
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:22,648
will cross us in the
Security Council now.

42
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,086
We seem to be heading southeast.
Where am I going?

43
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,852
Hope you like the smell
of fresh liberation.

44
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,022
Give me a sec.

45
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,160
I gotta growler down there
the size of a cane frog.

46
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:36,864
Turaqistan.

47
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,162
What's the gig?

48
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,004
<i>Omar Sharif.</i>

49
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,737
<i>- Omar Sharif?
- Yeah.</i>

50
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,893
<i>The CEO of Ugi Gas, the
Ugikistani conglomerate.</i>

51
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:50,745
<i>He is building a pipeline
through his country.</i>

52
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,787
<i>We didn't liberate Turaqistan
to get hustled by a fez head.</i>

53
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,077
<i>Terminate.</i>

54
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,316
<i>Do do that voodoo
that you do so well.</i>

55
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,352
You'll be working directly under the
viceroy just appointed by the president.

56
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,942
His identity is still being withheld
on a need to know basis.

57
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:07,727
- And no one needs to know.
- He asked for you personally.

58
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,786
- What's my cover?
- Trade show producer.

59
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:14,328
Trade show? What show?
What show?

60
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,668
It's gonna be huge.

61
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,042
Tamerlane is sponsoring
a trade expo, Brand USA.

62
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,396
It's our big launch bringing democracy
to this part of the world.

63
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:25,564
We've bombed the shit out of them,
there's a lot of rebuilding to do.

64
00:06:25,664 --> 00:06:28,633
- Shows a nice spirit.
- Somebody has to help them.

65
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:32,657
<i>This is a great opportunity
for Tamerlane and the U.S.</i>

66
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,139
<i>Not to mention the
people of Turaqistan.</i>

67
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:38,648
And to top it all off, there's gonna
be a gala wedding. Isn't that great?

68
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:42,651
Seems like a pretty elaborate cover. I'm
gonna be responsible for all that shit?

69
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:44,168
This is a historic moment.

70
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:49,454
The first war ever to be 100%
outsourced to private enterprise.

71
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:52,705
Tamerlane jets, Tamerlane
tanks, Tamerlane soldiers.

72
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,147
And to top it all off,
the Brand USA expo.

73
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,047
It's your show, baby.

74
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,107
Welcome to the Turaqi
Green Zone, sir.

75
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:23,000
<i>Tamerlane welcomes Expo
Turaqistan, Brand USA.</i>

76
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,703
Welcome to Turaqistan, sir.
I'm Marsha Dillon...

77
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:44,836
hoping you're
ready to kill.

78
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:45,754
I've been briefed.

79
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,126
SPF-Eighty-seven, sir.

80
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:50,951
- Shall we?
- Yes.

81
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,863
It all looks good.

82
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,689
Great lights.

83
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:05,992
<i>Take out the Tamercard.</i>

84
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:07,010
What's your cover, by the way?

85
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,129
Undergrad Wharton with a masters in
communication at the Annenberg School.

86
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:12,650
- Very impressive.
- Well, it's fake.

87
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,671
- Tell me that's not the stage?
- I think it is.

88
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:17,984
East, honey, east.

89
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,508
Do you want people turning away from
the stage to pray five times a day?

90
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:24,062
Cultural sensitivity.
That's what we're about here.

91
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,562
Sorry, sir.

92
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,234
What exactly is wrong
with my credentials?

93
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,965
I've been cleared. My
colleagues are going in.

94
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,659
- Am I being singled out for some reason?
- I can't allow that.

95
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,161
Very curious.

96
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:42,631
- Find out who she is.
- Very curious situation.

97
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:44,307
- Let's go, ma'am.
- Oh. Okay.

98
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,715
And set up a meeting
with her in my office.

99
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,678
Do I have an office?

100
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,289
Great. Carry on.

101
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,758
Yes, and I'll just try to
rearrange the entire place.

102
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,351
- Just see if you can spin it.
- Yes.

103
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,301
Ms. Hegalhuzen.

104
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,534
Your 2:30's here.

105
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,447
I read your piece in
"Atlantic Monthly".

106
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,744
Very provocative.

107
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,779
- Nice office.
- It's bulletproof.

108
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:26,956
<i>Send her in.</i>

109
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,793
Passion. This
is beautiful.

110
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,573
Thank you!

111
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,272
Hey, okay, okay,
we'll be in touch.

112
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,793
- It's a gift. I brought a gift to you.
- Thank you.

113
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:51,817
- It's a form of dance.
- Thank you. Good stuff.

114
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,078
Pay-for-view TV.
Next week!

115
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,702
And you are an angel.

116
00:10:58,802 --> 00:10:59,816
Thanks for the bag!

117
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,142
Ms."Hugelhazen".

118
00:11:04,242 --> 00:11:05,060
Hegalhuzen.

119
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,015
- Hegalhuzen. Brand Hauser.
- Hello.

120
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:09,046
- Hi.
- Hey.

121
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:10,033
Come on in.

122
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,401
Now...

123
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,603
Holy shit!

124
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,831
So, you're here to cover
our little trade show...

125
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:27,317
"...that's being billed as
a liberating Turaqistan...

126
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,049
satisfy the American consumer's
dreams just the opposite now.

127
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,740
The proposed Expo Turaqistan offers
nothing more than the auctioning of...

128
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,991
Turaqistan's future to the cause of
profit and international branding.

129
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,216
Yeah, I remember that because I wrote it.

130
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:43,950
There's no corruption here. Just
read the Silverman James Report.

131
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,618
I have. It's bullshit.

132
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:50,694
Look. We've already kicked out of this
place. What are we supposed to do?

133
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:54,061
Turn our backs on all of the
entrepreneurial possibilities?

134
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:58,640
Business is human response
to a moral or cosmic crisis.

135
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,199
Whether it's a tsunami or a
sustained aerial bombardment...

136
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:04,654
there's the same urgent
call for urban renewal.

137
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,707
When did they start attacking
inside the Emerald City?

138
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:10,159
I wouldn't call that an attack.

139
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,258
Well, technically, that was a bombing.
At least it sounded like it was.

140
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,335
Not an attack, which would
imply something else.

141
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,229
Do you really think
I'm as bad as all this?

142
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,770
- I don't know anything about you.
- Would you like to?

143
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:23,920
It's my job.

144
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,773
You make it sound so
tedious. Could be fun.

145
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,244
- Then why don't I begin?
- Thought you'd never ask.

146
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,015
Would you excuse me for one minute?

147
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,782
- Call me soon.
- When?

148
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:41,791
You'll feel it.

149
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:45,678
- All righty then. Where were we?
- I haven't said anything yet.

150
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:47,481
Excellent, 'cause I don't
remember hearing anything.

151
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:49,682
- Then we're off to a great start.
- What can I do for you?

152
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:53,261
Why do I have access?
Even on such a low level.

153
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,698
Ouch.

154
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,159
All my writings have called this
a violation of international law...

155
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:00,803
and its practitioners are criminals.

156
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,281
Do you really believe
all the stuff you write?

157
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,078
Anyone who could cause this much
mayhem when he didn't have to?

158
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,443
The amount of
suffering that I've seen?

159
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:09,914
Hang on.

160
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,220
Okay. Hold on a sec.

161
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,178
But the way I look at it is this.

162
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:20,148
The day we can actually feel and
hear all the suffering of mankind...

163
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:22,427
that's the day when the
Christ will come back.

164
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,730
So we got that going for us.
I'll be out in a minute.

165
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,907
Or the Buddha, or Allah,
whoever floats your boat.

166
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,965
Ms. Hagenhazel.

167
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:33,963
- Call me Natalie.
- Natalie.

168
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,675
I really must run. I feel like we're
on the verge of something important.

169
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,780
Do you think we could continue
this conversation over drinks?

170
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,049
- Drinks?
- Yeah, I know a friendly place.

171
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,990
Marsha, will you set that up?
9, 10-ish?

172
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,607
<i>Unattended cars will be
crushed and incinerated.</i>

173
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,898
Hello, sir. Welcome to Popeye's.
How can I help you?

174
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:17,170
I'll have crawfish étouffée, the Big
Flava chicken sandwich with Boss Sauce...

175
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,816
and to top off my meal,
a frothy orange drink.

176
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,353
- I'm here to see the viceroy.
- Sir.

177
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,987
Don't mention his name.
Follow me!

178
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,063
Okay!

179
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,015
Let's go, boys.
One, two, one, two march!

180
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,871
- He's not here?
- Closed circuit, sir.

181
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,790
<i>Welcome to liberated
Turaqistan, Hauser.</i>

182
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,456
<i>Big fan. Have been for ages.</i>

183
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:13,889
<i>Sorry for the secret
identity bullshit...</i>

184
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,573
<i>but it's a brave new security.</i>

185
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,029
<i>I'll be contacting you by phone,
but if you wish to contact me...</i>

186
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:20,983
<i>you'll have to come here
to the bunker, 'kay?</i>

187
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,051
<i>Omar Sharif.</i>

188
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:26,282
<i>He's staying at the Freedom
Grand through the closing ceremony.</i>

189
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,689
<i>Make sure he doesn't
make his plane.</i>

190
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,749
Got it.

191
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,111
<i>Now, about this
closing ceremony...</i>

192
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:33,858
<i>It looks like we Yonica Babyyeah
wedding. Incredible, huh?</i>

193
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,715
What is a Yonica Babyyeah?

194
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,359
<i>The Britney Spears
of Central Asia.</i>

195
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,921
<i>Kids from Baca to Yemen
are nuts for her.</i>

196
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:41,654
<i>Anyway. The point is...</i>

197
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:44,024
<i>this weddin' is the grand
finale of the trade show.</i>

198
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:47,529
<i>This is the biggest extravaganza
in the history of Central Asia.</i>

199
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:49,497
<i>And it's the centerpiece
of our P.R. blitz here.</i>

200
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:51,343
<i>It's perfect branding synergy, Hauser.</i>

201
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:55,201
Blends the image of an American-style
woman getting her own and getting it on.

202
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:56,604
A great new
democratic dynasty...

203
00:15:56,704 --> 00:16:00,238
with all the strength and
virility of traditional warlords.

204
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:02,440
<i>Exactly.
That's why you're the best.</i>

205
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,542
<i>Overall, we see it as a
pretty irresistible package.</i>

206
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:08,828
<i>We're getting worldwide coverage, U.S.
networks, Sky Channel, Al Jazeera...</i>

207
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:09,981
<i>so make it big buddy.</i>

208
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,718
<i>See she gets everything she wants
and make this a grand finale...</i>

209
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:13,986
<i>the world will never forget.</i>

210
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:14,732
You bet.

211
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,527
Jeff? So, listen. I met this guy...
No, he's just some mid-level schmo.

212
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:23,498
Anyway, I think if I play him right, I
can get a pass out of the Green Zone...

213
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:25,642
and I can see what's
really going on here.

214
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,274
No chip for me, thanks.

215
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,320
Ma'am, you really won't get the
full experience without the chip.

216
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,137
Doctor's orders.
I get hives.

<i>Mr. Hauser!</i>

Yonica Baby is two minutes
from arrival. We need to go.

229
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,641
Yonica!
I love you!

230
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,519
Jesus Christ.

231
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,676
Hi. Welcome. How
was traffic?

232
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,513
I hear those checkpoints
can be murder.

233
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:56,580
Where is dressing room?
I'm fucking wasted.

234
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,580
Well, let me show you.

235
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,554
She needs Popeye ten-piece box.
All white meat.

236
00:18:59,654 --> 00:19:02,129
Extra crispy, extra spicy.
Diet Coke. You get it?

237
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:03,867
And pickles.

238
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,557
She wants pickles.
Clausen classic dill pickles.

239
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:07,860
- Pickles?
- Yeah.

240
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,710
- All right...
- You are big boss?

241
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,642
- I guess I am, yeah.
- How big?

242
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,602
Don't do that.

243
00:19:15,702 --> 00:19:16,984
Confiscate that film.

244
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,320
I do what I want.
Okay?

245
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,175
Of course you do and we're
excited to have you.

246
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:23,043
Don't get too excited.

247
00:19:23,143 --> 00:19:25,221
I'm not that excited. Let me
show you to your dressing room.

248
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,689
Get some chicken, pickles.
and whatever you want.

249
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,399
Come on in. Hi.
Nice work with the bat.

250
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,235
How are you? Hi, good luck.

251
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,969
Hi. Mr. Pickle. Las Vegas.
Mr. Federline.

252
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,642
<i>The impending marriage of
Central Asian pop star...</i>

253
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:53,649
<i>and Ooq- Mi-Fay Taqnufmini the
scion of the powerful Turaqi clan.</i>

254
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,276
<i>The marriage.
A symbol of democratization...</i>

255
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,762
<i>or a sleazy public
relations stunt?</i>

256
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,584
<i>Yes or no?</i>

257
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:04,533
Natalie.

258
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,436
- Hi.
- Hi.

259
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,440
Jesus.
What is this place?

260
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,337
It's the Freedom Grand.
How do you like it?

261
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,536
Guess I could go with
strange love in the desert.

262
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,778
Weird. Rarefied.
Coven-like.

263
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,685
- Stop me if I'm rambling.
- Stop. Sit.

264
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,088
Can I get a double bourbon?
Vodka twist? How's that?

265
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,583
- Okay.
- Thank you.

266
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,526
So, you're producing the big...

267
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,513
Freedom's on the March economic
land-grab masquerade.

268
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:36,727
Are you with Tamerlane employee
or a freelance producer?

269
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,794
That's complicated.
Let's get to that later.

270
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,037
I just wanted to get to know you.

271
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,675
Okay, tell me about yourself.

272
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:50,498
Just doing this gig, trying to
make the best of a bad situation.

273
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:53,642
Looking for redemption in all the wrong
places. Stop me now if I'm rambling.

274
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,642
- Okay, stop.
- How about you?

275
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,652
How about me what?

276
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,019
You know, tell me about you.
Where're you from?

277
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,586
Who gives a fuck? Are you serious?

278
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,724
I'm serious as a deacon. I'd like
to get to know you as a person.

279
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,859
For God's sakes... why?

280
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,301
Well, what the hell else are we gonna
do on this dark and lonely night?

281
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,694
So you wanna seduce the journalist
whose politics you despise?

282
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:21,426
How dare you?
I have no politics.

283
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:23,537
Everyone does, even if
they don't know it.

284
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,384
- Not me.
- Just a straight mercenary?

285
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,249
I'm a host. I'm a showman.
I'm an organizer.

286
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,606
There's just people here. Some good,
some bad. All interesting.

287
00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:35,706
You seem like an interesting person and
I try not to over-think these things.

288
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:39,491
You're a clever guy.
Some would even call you charming.

289
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,798
But it gets tired, doesn't it? All that
patter, the show biz, it's just a mask.

290
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,564
There's gotta be a person
in there somewhere.

291
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,869
Did you know that "person" comes from
the Latin word persona which means mask?

292
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,626
Being human means we
invite spectators...

293
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:57,579
to ponder what lies behind.

294
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,665
Each of us would be composed
of a variety of masks.

295
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:05,573
And if we can see behind the mask,
we would get a burst of clarity.

296
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:09,583
If that flame was bright
enough, then we fall in love.

297
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,394
What's your opinion on
these divine matters?

298
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,927
I'm not gonna fuck you.
You know that, right?

299
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,601
Oh, I hope that you
know that somewhere.

300
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,422
I sense you're such an angry woman.

301
00:22:23,522 --> 00:22:25,759
You're just intent to laying
waste to all of us, aren't you?

302
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:30,009
That was the best half-true
frontier gibberish I've heard.

303
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,206
Thanks.

304
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,564
- Hey. Listen.
- Yes?

305
00:22:33,664 --> 00:22:36,120
All access pass to the trade show,
compliments of the house.

306
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,785
- Don't be a stranger.
- I won't be.

307
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,592
Now, let's get these passé's right.

308
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,560
Ayat, a little knee jerk.

309
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,694
Make it work. Make it work.

310
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:50,631
Very good.

311
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,452
All in the legs, girls.

312
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:55,267
How many times do we have
to say this? Ayat!

313
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:56,966
Higher!

314
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,545
Big smile, Reshbeck!
For God's sake.

315
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:05,746
Thank you.

316
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,066
You're back for some more gibberish.

317
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,564
You remember Marsha?
This is Peter Parker.

318
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:12,579
Choreographer, worked with Rob
Marshall, all the big musicals.

319
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,503
It's incredible. Each girl
is a trans-femoral amputee...

320
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,843
who had lost her leg
during the liberation.

321
00:23:16,943 --> 00:23:23,379
And thanks to Tamerlane, we can
have you up and dancing in no time.

322
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,718
Just another example of
how American know-how...

323
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:27,294
alleviates the suffering it creates.

324
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:32,524
Look at this. Hamy Shenkman had her leg
blown off by an M-18 Claymore landmine.

325
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:37,600
And, Conyel Bisland...
an M-72 rocket-propelled grenade...

326
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,229
that mistakenly hit her high school.

327
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:42,203
And Tamerlane used the exact same RPG
firing pin rod assembly technology...

328
00:23:42,303 --> 00:23:44,604
that it uses in the prosthetic
knees of its.

329
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:46,202
Talk about vertical integration.

330
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:47,986
It's hot in here.
Let me get that for ya.

331
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,458
Krishmish, come over here.

332
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,857
This is Ms. Hegalhuzen, she's
writing a story about the show.

333
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,215
All right. Okay.

334
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:58,030
Ms. Babyyeah's ready
for her run-through.

335
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,452
We've gotta go. My trade
show's your trade show.

336
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:01,733
Come on, girls. Gather here.

337
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:26,529
<i>You say you want to
invade me, baby</i>

338
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,423
<i>You say you want to
enslave me, baby</i>

339
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,502
<i>I want to blow you up</i>

340
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,312
<i>You say you want
to free me, baby</i>

341
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:45,409
<i>BGut you cannot
even see me, baby</i>

342
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,520
<i>I want to blow you up</i>

343
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:57,083
<i>I want to blow you sky
high, high, go fly</i>

344
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:03,715
<i>I want to blow</i>

345
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:04,564
<i>You</i>

346
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,874
<i>You want to occupy
my heart and soul</i>

347
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,503
<i>A black widow in
a spider hole</i>

348
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,912
<i>I want to blow you up</i>

349
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,918
<i>I want to blow you up</i>

350
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:33,488
<i>I want to blow you
down if it's okay</i>

351
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,729
Mr. Hauser, how do you feel about
the image of Turaqi women...

352
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,162
My coat!

353
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,604
Cut!

354
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,047
So there's this reporter
who really despises me.

355
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,548
I mean, she doesn't really despise me,
she despises what I represent.

356
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:02,791
I think if she knew the real me,
she'd hate me even more.

357
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:04,188
I mean, don't you think?

358
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,663
<i>I wasn't there.
Does it really matter?</i>

359
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,166
Actually, I think I just like
the sound of her voice.

360
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,832
I could listen to her
revile me for hours.

361
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:16,338
Do you think with her, the reporter
I mean, it's just about sex?

362
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,800
<i>- What do you mean just?
- I don't know.</i>

363
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:23,540
There's this Turaqi pop star. She
disturbs me and I can't figure out why.

364
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,015
<i>Could you be attracted to her sexually?</i>

365
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,016
No, are you crazy?
She's just a little...

366
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,748
<i>I'm not calling you in the
middle of the night, Mr. Hauser.</i>

367
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,673
<i>- I gotta go.
- Whatever.</i>

368
00:26:33,773 --> 00:26:35,056
You're a fuckin' asshole.

369
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,522
<i>GuideStar!</i>

370
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,928
This has to end for me, sir. I
want a different kind of life.

371
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,102
I want to get married, start a family.

372
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,673
Operation Chickenhawk
never ends.

373
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,723
The ceaseless epic struggle
to dominate...

374
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:56,495
the destiny of man obliges his noble
cares to continually purge the world...

375
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:58,933
of those who are evil-doers.

376
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,882
But that's not just working
for me right now, sir.

377
00:27:01,518 --> 00:27:02,485
A woman?

378
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:07,784
You and I, Hauser, are
a part of a rug hook.

379
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:13,130
All these years I felt a special
bond. Don't you feel that?

380
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:15,790
No.

381
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,460
Well, you think about it.

382
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,155
If you still feel this
way in a couple of days...

383
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:21,170
I already told you, sir.

384
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,868
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

385
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,530
Marsha, this is kind of a bad time.

386
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,067
<i>Hey! I wanted to give you the heads up.
A delivery should be there any second.</i>

387
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,054
When, now?

388
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:16,481
Oh, shit.

389
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,671
Sir, I have your
dry cleaning, sir!

390
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,040
Thank you. Thank you.

391
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,444
I need the ticket, sir.

392
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,935
- I have that somewhere.
- Yeah, I need that claim ticket, sir.

393
00:28:46,035 --> 00:28:50,642
I think I put it... should
be around here somewhere.

394
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:54,278
- You're talking about the claim ticket?
- It's around here somewhere.

395
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:56,514
- Sir, can you hurry?
- Yep.

396
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,432
Sir, I gotta have that ticket or...

397
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,429
No, no...

398
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,065
Oh, here it is.

399
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,509
- Sir, you have a nice day.
- Sure.

400
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,451
Yo, yo, yo, mother fuckers!

401
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,499
It's me.

402
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,350
- Hi.
- Hi.

403
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,736
Straight from the dry
in Rammstein, Germany

404
00:29:49,836 --> 00:29:52,586
You can't believe these guys. 20
years ahead of the rest of the world.

405
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,352
And this cost the U.S. taxpayers, what?
Three, four grand?

406
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,291
Be nice.
I'm really sorry about the jacket.

407
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,225
Okay.

408
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,146
Listen, would you like to get
a Turaqi coffee?

409
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:02,948
I hear they make it great here.
Cardamom mace. The good kind.

410
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:04,716
I was just about to wash my hair.

411
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:06,964
It's a delicacy. Sweetened
with pomegranate honey.

412
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,002
One cup?

413
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,478
Give me a minute.

414
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,002
What?

415
00:30:26,102 --> 00:30:29,043
There's just something irresistible
about a Western woman speaking Turaqi.

416
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:30,876
Is that a recognized
international phenomena?

417
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:32,691
No. It's a personal sensibility.

418
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:37,950
Look. I admit I don't actually
believe any of this stuff we say.

419
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,685
I mean, not in the sense that I
believe it to be actually true.

420
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:43,741
You talk too much. I want
to ask you something.

421
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,860
Doesn't it hurt you to put yourself
in such a contorted moral position?

422
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,814
Can you tell me, for example,
one completely honest thing?

423
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:55,484
One.

424
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,842
This is Donny Loo's
favorite juice.

425
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:07,420
It is rated at just under a quarter
million Scoville units.

426
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:11,583
When I find the demands of
life to be challenging...

427
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:12,898
I take a wee drop.

428
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,603
The more challenging...

429
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,175
the higher the Scoville units.

430
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,042
- Let me.
- Be careful.

431
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,934
But the trick, you see...

432
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:29,578
that I've taught myself, is to
never allow my eyes to tear up.

433
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,956
One completely honest thing.

434
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:42,547
If you really knew me, you'd despise
me even more than you do.

435
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:44,068
No. I don't despise you.

436
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,569
I don't really care enough.

437
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:16,757
Marsha.

438
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,371
It's fucking great.
Michael Bay can blow me.

439
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:23,654
He can and he should.

440
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:25,991
- We do all of Yonica's videos.
- We're blowing up.

441
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:27,489
A bad choice
of words.

442
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:29,496
Listen, guys, this has been great.
Thank you.

443
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:31,932
I have another meeting. I have to run.
But I, I really enjoyed it.

444
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:34,463
Let us have some footage of the
wedding. We'll hook you up, dude.

445
00:32:34,563 --> 00:32:36,734
Hey, we know everything that
goes on in Turaqistan.

446
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:40,241
No place we cannot go, no one we
don't know, nothing we cannot do.

447
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:40,938
Okay.

448
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:43,506
Does one of you have a card?
Whoever the leader is.

449
00:32:43,606 --> 00:32:44,742
Here we go. The Jackpot.

450
00:32:44,842 --> 00:32:46,626
Here, thank you. Thank you.

451
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,451
There you go. You have his,
and he has yours.

452
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,581
- Yes.
- He's got yours.

453
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:52,863
- It's gonna be great.
- Bye-bye, guys.

454
00:32:56,606 --> 00:32:58,267
Where's my package?

455
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,568
The shipment left the warehouse
in Dubai 2 days ago.

456
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,139
We're tracking it.

457
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,184
Just get me a fuckin' cobra,
all right?

458
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,943
- A snake?
- Yeah. Chop-chop.

459
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,225
Come on, spit it out.

460
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,294
Is only me, Mr. Big

461
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,339
Yonica. Hi.

462
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,692
Listen. Sorry about my reaction to
your song. I didn't mean to offend you.

463
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:41,117
No. I am sorry. I am so stupid to
not understand that you are woman.

464
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:41,947
Uh, sorry?

465
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:46,783
In Turaqi we have no word for
this. Same as for a woman.

466
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,610
No, no, no.
That's not it.

467
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,994
I predict most people.
Why not you?

468
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,329
How my ass make
you puke?

469
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,887
Bad babakanoosh or something.

470
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:02,086
I think you're lovely.
Stunning, actually.

471
00:34:02,186 --> 00:34:03,538
- Lovely?
- Yes.

472
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:07,338
You think attractive?

473
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,470
Yep. Definitely.

474
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,348
- Does her ass make you puke?
- Who? Who? Who?

475
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,721
That skinny bitch reporter
with the tape recorder.

476
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,749
No.

477
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,727
You're a tit man.
Do you want massage?

478
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,754
Be a happy ending.

479
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,692
Does your father know that you
talk this way?

480
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,399
- My father?
- Yeah.

481
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,731
I do not speak to him anymore.

482
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:42,444
But he sends me money for dancing
lessons and singing lessons.

483
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,748
I am with Ooq-Mi-Fay now.

484
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:48,607
And he wants for me
to be big success.

485
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,654
Yonica rules.
That is what he says to me.

486
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:54,718
- What about your mother?
- Dead.

487
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:55,872
I'm sorry.

488
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:58,485
For why? You did not kill her.

489
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,697
I don't think so.

490
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,395
Too much sorry. Too much.

491
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,687
Jesus Christ!
What is wrong with you?

492
00:35:09,787 --> 00:35:12,890
You are a fucking asshole,
do you know that?

493
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,524
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

494
00:35:14,624 --> 00:35:17,694
"I'm sorry".
You're always sorry.

495
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:19,739
Fuck you, Mr. Sorry.
Fuck you.

496
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,249
Yonica, don't go away mad.

497
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,591
Marsha?

498
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,727
<i>Get me a dinner reservation
tonight. Somewhere with soup.</i>

499
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,486
So everything's OK? You're closing
some big deals at the trade show?

500
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:43,506
Is there an actual
reason for this meeting?

501
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,189
I am not big on bullshit.

502
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:49,596
I'm your host. I want you to be
happy nd that everything is...

503
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:51,512
well and you're
taken care of.

504
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:53,745
A beautiful woman.

505
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,243
There is something we can
agree on after all, then.

506
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,550
Can you get me an introduction?

507
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,348
- She's a journalist.
- Who cares?

508
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,388
Sit.
Don't eat all your soup.

509
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:06,491
Thank you.

510
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:14,284
<i>So between your father's indictments,
were you still on the lacrosse team?</i>

511
00:36:14,384 --> 00:36:16,670
No. I actually blew out my fuckin' knee.
Hey, you.

512
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,042
Hey, we are doing
an interview here.

513
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,657
Omar Sharif wants to meet you.

514
00:36:21,757 --> 00:36:23,737
- The actor?
- Better. The president of Ugi Gas.

515
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:25,738
Sorry. Just one minute.

516
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,015
I'm gonna pick this up in one.

517
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:34,085
who do I have to shoot to get
a fuckin' drink around here?

518
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:41,765
What are you looking at?

519
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,265
What are you looking at?

520
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,301
Get back to normal!

521
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,307
Natalie Hegalhuzen,
Omar Sharif.

522
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,380
Exquisitely enraptured, ma chère.

523
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,907
- Pleased to meet you, too.
- Shall we dance?

524
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,688
How're you doin'?

525
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,873
How come we Americans
a hard time?

526
00:37:40,973 --> 00:37:42,357
An interesting conundrum, isn't it?

527
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,017
Very shrewd of you to ask.

528
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,028
What would I get
for telling you?

529
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:51,600
The thrill of knowing you're
my confidential source.

530
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,568
The thought of this
leaves me breathless.

531
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,713
My dear, let me explain
something to you.

532
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,613
The Americans
had no plan.

533
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:11,486
Perhaps next year they
will invade my country.

534
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,822
And then, they will either
kill me or throw me in jail.

535
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,120
Or kill me in jail.

536
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,653
Or maybe make me president.

537
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,996
Or maybe make me president,
then kill me.

538
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,998
That still doesn't
answer you question.

539
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,533
Why hasn't the U.S. stopped
the Ugi Gas pipeline?

540
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,456
See what you can find out about
Operation Chickenhawk.

541
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:33,406
Chickenhawk?

542
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,021
Yeah, baby!

543
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:28,732
Get it out.

544
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,816
<i>A message from the viceroy.</i>

545
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,540
<i>Freedom is messy.</i>

546
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,747
<i>Employees must wash hands
before returning to work.</i>

547
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:08,529
What stinks here?

548
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:13,723
Yeah. You look like piece of shit.
You smell like piece of shit.

549
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:14,937
You want some shit?

550
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:29,974
Where're you going?
Night's young.

551
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:31,241
This place is crazy.

552
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:34,146
Would you like to come back to
my suite for a quiet drink?

553
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:38,065
Oh, no thank you, Omar. But I will
look into that thing about you told.

554
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:42,536
Enjoyed it.

555
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:53,696
- I think I'll go back to my hotel.
- Can I drive you?

556
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:54,965
Oh, no, that's okay.

557
00:40:55,065 --> 00:40:56,986
Let me give you a lift.
I can help you. It's safer that way.

558
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,721
Please.
I'll feel better.

559
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,124
When did all that construction start?

560
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:07,446
Oh. They're diverting the river Tures
so it runs by the trade show.

561
00:41:07,546 --> 00:41:11,058
They wanted a clear view from
the Tiki Room. It's cute, huh?

562
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,727
What do you think
of that girl, Yonica?

563
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,167
You don't wanna know.

564
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,505
- Come on. Try me.
- Okay.

565
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:25,597
I think that she's a sad little
girl who's been pimped out...

566
00:41:25,697 --> 00:41:29,676
into a pathetic monstrosity of
alienated Western sexuality.

567
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,554
How do you feel about that, Mr. Hauser?

568
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,624
She's a disaster.
This whole place is a disaster.

569
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,853
So, you're sleeping with her.

570
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:40,143
No.

571
00:41:40,243 --> 00:41:41,682
Why not?
She seems game.

572
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:45,758
It must be nice to be who you say you
are. To do things you believe in.

573
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,695
That's so simple. So clean.

574
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,968
It's like, you know: "why didn't
I think of that"?

575
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:56,906
Well, it's hard not to feel like...

576
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,101
I'm always on
the losing side.

577
00:42:01,201 --> 00:42:02,209
Well, you are.

578
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,817
Yeah. It gets kinda Ionely.

579
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:09,172
That's why you got all those peasants
and workers to keep you company.

580
00:42:09,272 --> 00:42:11,091
I don't have that big a bed.

581
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:12,819
Tell me more.

582
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,891
I think that you should
take me home now.

583
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:22,731
Yes, well...

584
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,138
thanks for
taking me home.

585
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:26,834
Oh. Good night then.

586
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:41,985
Jesus, what was that?

587
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,221
I can't do that...

588
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,746
No. You yourself said,
I just don't want to.

589
00:42:49,846 --> 00:42:51,630
- Yeah. Sure.
- And good night.

590
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,570
Tomorrow can I see ya?

591
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,566
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

592
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,974
Reporter's Pool, ten a.m.

593
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:05,932
Progress update, people.

594
00:43:06,032 --> 00:43:09,031
Banks West didn't even wait
for the opening ceremony...

595
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:12,748
closing a one point 3
billion dollar deal...

596
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:17,643
with Roof Branch and Blossom to
restore essential water services...

597
00:43:17,743 --> 00:43:20,526
to the people of Turaqistan!

598
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,660
Oh, come on!

599
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:27,450
I'm sure they'd like to give a shout-out
to the Tamerlane- Furg-Bomber...

600
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,688
Wing for, for those
humane position strikes...

601
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:35,211
that created this wonderful
opportunity for everyone.

602
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:39,777
So is this like a date?

603
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,180
This is like obscene.

604
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,749
There's something you can do
for me that would mean a lot.

605
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:46,748
Name it.

606
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,706
Get me a pass out of the Emerald City
so I can see what's really going on.

607
00:43:49,806 --> 00:43:51,624
- Very dangerous.
- I wanna see Fallof.

608
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:53,610
Natalie, there's nothing there.

609
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,981
I wanna know if it's true that
Tamerlane used chemical weapons.

610
00:43:56,081 --> 00:43:58,694
Isn't it a little late to be worrying
about international conventions?

611
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:04,189
Is nerve gas worse than getting your
head blown off by a laser missile?

612
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:06,559
Frankly, it's a nuance
that's lost on me.

613
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:09,159
Besides they were cleared,
just read the report.

614
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:10,861
We're trying to watch
a battle here.

615
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:11,915
Sorry.

616
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,754
Come on, come on, come on.
Give me something. Give me something.

617
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:22,314
Anything's gotta be better
than this Xbox bullshit!

618
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,426
Okay, okay.

619
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,713
These guys are big in the
Turaqi arts community.

620
00:44:28,813 --> 00:44:30,183
You know, the whole downtown scene?

621
00:44:30,283 --> 00:44:31,757
Might give you a good lead.

622
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,531
I'm hit!
I'm hit!

623
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,976
Where's the damn Medevac?

624
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,491
<i>The Tamerlane custom
E- Z missile mount can...</i>

625
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:46,778
<i>be adapted to fit over 200
automobile models...</i>

626
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:48,667
I thought we were all
set with the Ayatollah.

627
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,548
Pick it up, boys.

628
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,521
What do you mean he won't
do a mixed wedding? Who's mixed?

629
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,584
Yonica's Episcopalian?
How the fuck did that happen?

630
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,086
Will the Sufi work?

631
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:00,378
Let me call you back.
I got another call.

632
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:01,645
Just get a number for Cat Stevens.

633
00:45:01,745 --> 00:45:05,224
Hello. Can you calm down?
Yeah, he's right here.

634
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,937
Yoni...
That was the girl.

635
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,191
She said she can't do the
wedding if you're involved.

636
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,625
She thinks you don't like her.

637
00:45:12,725 --> 00:45:14,493
- What?
- She can't work with you.

638
00:45:14,593 --> 00:45:16,125
I'm on it, I'm on it.
Okay.

639
00:45:16,225 --> 00:45:18,565
And then Anderson Cooper,
Mr. Salt and Pepper Integrity...

640
00:45:18,665 --> 00:45:22,598
is arriving today and, and all
we have left is a junior suite.

641
00:45:22,698 --> 00:45:24,868
Is that okay? I mean, he is
a Vanderbilt and everything.

642
00:45:24,968 --> 00:45:26,752
There could be repercussions!

643
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,448
<i>GuideStar!</i>

644
00:45:36,548 --> 00:45:38,918
<i>You seem a little bit, Mr. Hauser.
Is everything all right?</i>

645
00:45:39,018 --> 00:45:42,922
My hand was shaking.
My hand never shakes.

646
00:45:43,022 --> 00:45:46,373
<i>Worst case, Parkinson's. I can get
you a doctor's appointment in Dubai.</i>

647
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,603
I can't focus.

648
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,460
This girl. This reporter.
They're in my head.

649
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,661
They're in my fucking brain.

650
00:45:51,761 --> 00:45:54,668
<i>That's not good, Mr. Hauser.
Not good.</i>

651
00:45:54,768 --> 00:45:58,119
No, I know it isn't. And now I
gotta see her, the little one.

652
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,713
I gotta bring her food.'Cause
she won't go to the thing.

653
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:03,288
Fuck!

654
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:28,178
<i>Trusting you was a little rude</i>

655
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,647

00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:52,075
<i>Phone cut out
When we were talking today</i>

659
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:55,009
That was beautiful.

660
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:02,552
- You recorded that yet?
- Fat fucking chance.

661
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,620
Well you should.

662
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,870
I feel like it's like I'm
seeing you for the first time.

663
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:10,154
Well, you've seen my ass.
And you not liking it.

664
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,140
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

665
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,675
Talk as if you have no soul.

666
00:47:13,775 --> 00:47:18,950
Nobody cares for my beautiful soul.
They care for my ass.

667
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,470
- You sound like a tramp.
- Bitches rule.

668
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,968
Yonica rules.

669
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:28,207
Virgins are good for
getting fucked. Right?

670
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,895
That is what I am good for. Right?

671
00:47:31,995 --> 00:47:33,711
That's what everybody knows.

672
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:38,919
You know what I think?

673
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,982
I think the girl that wrote
that song was a poet.

674
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,494
I thought that song was really great.

675
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,409
I am not from this world.

676
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,379
I have special powers.

677
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,886
I can see inside
people's brains.

678
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,717
What do you see?

679
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,556
You think you care about me.

680
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:27,093
Neither one of us know why.

681
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:31,430
You're not an
alien life form.

682
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:36,009
You're just very confused.

683
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,577
And you live in a terrible world.

684
00:48:56,633 --> 00:49:02,799
I cannot be from this place.
I do not belong here.

685
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,534
We have to find a way.

686
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,509
We just have to find a way.

687
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,149
Who are you?

688
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,279
We got stuff here.

689
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,707
We got a side of
Clausen Classic Dill,

690
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:23,817
and Turaqi brand soda.

691
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,789
Extra crispy, all white meat.
You want a piece?

692
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:32,033
It's actually a horrible way
to soothe bad feelings...

693
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:35,564
but can lead to compulsive eating...

694
00:49:35,671 --> 00:49:37,502
But, you know, sometimes you
just gotta do it, right?

695
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:48,641
What the fuck?

696
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:55,589
You know what?

697
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:01,363
I'm gonna blow you up.
you mother fuckin' nice...

698
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:04,559
suit necktie piece of shit!

699
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,365
Take a rain check on that.

700
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,434
Out of the Emerald City?

701
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,569
In fact, baby, the money is right,
I can take you to Chechnya.

702
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:20,515
I could scrape together
a thousand dollars.

703
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,555
Honey, for a thousand dollar
we take you to Starbucks.

704
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,290
So, we open on her,
she's like Snow White.

705
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:33,746
Then he arrives. A two-shot, like in,
Ford's My Darling Clementine.

706
00:50:33,846 --> 00:50:35,681
When Victor Mature
returns to her.

707
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:37,791
Fuck film, assholes.

708
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:43,618
I want her on all fours.

709
00:50:43,718 --> 00:50:49,725
Waiting for her phallic
warlord, Ooq-Mi-Fay.

710
00:50:49,825 --> 00:50:52,077
I know it's none of my business,
what are you guys talking about?

711
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,718
We're shooting the
wedding night's video.

712
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:58,018
Yeah, check it out.
We already made the card.

713
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,748
My God.

714
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,707
- How much you guys want for this?
- 500 bucks.

715
00:51:04,807 --> 00:51:06,713
I'll give you 50
right now, cash.

716
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:07,491
Done.

717
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:12,181
<i>Washington's all a-twitter by
allegations from a journalist...</i>

718
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:15,087
<i>that the son of a top
Turaqi political leader...</i>

719
00:51:15,187 --> 00:51:17,754
<i>and his pop star
bride are involved...</i>

720
00:51:17,854 --> 00:51:21,767
<i>in a pornographic video of
their own wedding night.</i>

721
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:26,246
<i>Expo Turaqistan. Out of the
frying pan into the fire?</i>

722
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:31,214
<i>How in the fuck did this Hegalhuzen
bitch get a hold of this story?</i>

723
00:51:31,265 --> 00:51:34,415
<i>How in the fuck did this Hegalhuzen
bitch get a hold of this story?</i>

724
00:51:34,515 --> 00:51:35,750
Well, it hardly matters now.

725
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:39,453
<i>The network might cancel their
coverage and we own them.</i>

726
00:51:39,553 --> 00:51:42,340
<i>We got riots going on in 14
cities across Central Asia.</i>

727
00:51:42,443 --> 00:51:45,795
Maybe the best thing to do would
be to call the wedding off.

728
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:48,610
<i>Have you lost your mind?
Just handle it.</i>

729
00:51:48,716 --> 00:51:49,512
I always do.

730
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:53,120
Do you think I have no feelings?

731
00:51:53,621 --> 00:51:55,111
This is what I am to you?

732
00:51:55,523 --> 00:51:58,707
- A whore? And you are my pimp?
- No, baby, no, baby.

733
00:51:58,807 --> 00:52:00,908
You were going to sell a
tape of our wedding night?

734
00:52:01,008 --> 00:52:02,690
I was gonna give you half of the money.

735
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:05,355
I did it for the money.

736
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:18,826
There will be ample time
for loving recriminations.

737
00:52:18,926 --> 00:52:21,541
But let's deal with this from
a practical perspective.

738
00:52:22,717 --> 00:52:27,086
What if we publically
remove one of his testicles?

739
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:28,917
- Dad, please!
- Shut up.

740
00:52:29,824 --> 00:52:31,872
That's not an entirely
unappealing suggestion...

741
00:52:31,972 --> 00:52:34,156
but I'm not sure if that really
gets us where we wanna go.

742
00:52:34,495 --> 00:52:38,916
Honestly, your Excellency, if we're gonna
pull this off so a man of your stature...

743
00:52:39,016 --> 00:52:41,832
you know, a four-time convicted
extortionist and an embezzler like...

744
00:52:41,936 --> 00:52:45,531
yourself is to lead Turaqistan to
its bright and shining future...

745
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:48,733
Yonica's bridegroom must
be blamelessly pristine.

746
00:52:50,978 --> 00:52:52,828
In other words, we
need a fall guy.

747
00:52:52,928 --> 00:52:55,711
How about your homeboy outside
with the perforated septum?

748
00:52:56,417 --> 00:52:57,801
P-per... what?

749
00:52:57,901 --> 00:53:02,880
Go, Marsha. Go, Marsha. You're so fine.
I'm gonna make her change her mind!

750
00:53:03,424 --> 00:53:06,810
I have a can of Mace!

751
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,556
And I will use it!
Sit down!

752
00:53:16,337 --> 00:53:21,759
I think Bodhi organized this whole thing
and you didn't know anything about it.

753
00:53:21,859 --> 00:53:23,309
Yeah, of course, man.
I didn't know shit.

754
00:53:25,179 --> 00:53:27,807
But, you know, we wanna be
culturally sensitive here.

755
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:30,974
What is the traditional punishment
for pimping a pop star?

756
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,115
- Wow, that's fucking cold, Pop.
- Shut up.

757
00:53:35,891 --> 00:53:38,039
Drowning in sheep dung.

758
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:39,807
Marsha will make the arrangements.

759
00:53:39,907 --> 00:53:43,728
All right. We've dealt with
the groom. Now for the bride.

760
00:53:44,698 --> 00:53:48,917
20 minutes on TV and the world will
know that this sweet, young girl...

761
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:54,566
would never participate in such
a foul, foul enterprise. Right?

762
00:53:54,975 --> 00:53:56,793
And, Yonica, you didn't
know anything about this.

763
00:53:56,893 --> 00:54:00,838
So it has the added benefit of being
true, as my father used to say.

764
00:54:01,816 --> 00:54:03,784
All right. We'll announce
the execution tonight.

765
00:54:03,884 --> 00:54:05,133
We'll do the interview tomorrow...

766
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:08,655
and we go ahead with the wedding
and close the whole damn show.

767
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:10,685
I think we got this worked out, don't you?

768
00:54:11,058 --> 00:54:12,937
- Great.
- All right. Good to see you.

769
00:54:13,037 --> 00:54:14,119
No, no, no...

770
00:54:14,895 --> 00:54:15,953
Thank you so much, sir.

771
00:54:16,964 --> 00:54:18,625
Yonica... Honey!
Honey!

772
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,267
Yonica, Yonica!

773
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,798
Thank you. I like bag.

774
00:54:32,011 --> 00:54:35,913
Marsha. Get me Katie Couric, Al Jazeera
and a hundred gallons of sheep shit.

775
00:54:56,403 --> 00:54:57,836
<i>Slaves, but...</i>

776
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:04,477
<i>Slaves, plebians, patricians,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

777
00:55:04,979 --> 00:55:06,661
<i>Welcome to Pax Romana...</i>

778
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:09,375
<i>Virginia's number one
Roman-era theme park.</i>

779
00:55:12,453 --> 00:55:16,389
The glory that was Rome.
The grandeur that was Six Flags.

780
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:20,208
Unfortunately the financing fell
through in the real estate crash...

781
00:55:20,308 --> 00:55:22,922
and the whole place went down the
toilet. But it makes my point.

782
00:55:23,464 --> 00:55:24,294
Which is...?

783
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:29,965
Every empire is summed up in
Rome. The Romans, Hauser.

784
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:33,568
Dudes of the human race.
Torch-bearers of culture.

785
00:55:33,974 --> 00:55:35,134
You and I are Centurions.

786
00:55:35,476 --> 00:55:38,660
Honor bound to defend civilization
against the Barbarians.

787
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,293
Let's cut the shit, Walken.

788
00:55:40,393 --> 00:55:42,178
I like killing people as
much as the next guy...

789
00:55:42,283 --> 00:55:46,671
but I signed up to kill the bad ones.
Health clinics, trade unionists...

790
00:55:46,771 --> 00:55:50,987
journalists, agricultural co-ops,
Catholic liberation theologians...

791
00:55:51,091 --> 00:55:53,308
impoverished Colombian
coffee farmers...

792
00:55:53,408 --> 00:55:56,557
These are barbarians, the depraved
opponents of civilization?

793
00:55:56,664 --> 00:55:59,746
We turned Central America
into a fucking graveyard.

794
00:55:59,846 --> 00:56:02,882
Whoever momentarily interrupts
the accumulation of our wealth...

795
00:56:02,982 --> 00:56:04,232
we pulverize.

796
00:56:05,072 --> 00:56:07,302
I'm just not feeling good
about that anymore, sir.

797
00:56:10,778 --> 00:56:12,769
Then do what you
have to do, son.

798
00:56:14,381 --> 00:56:16,372
Thank you for understanding, sir.

799
00:56:17,551 --> 00:56:19,644
- Oh! You asshole.
- Weapon, please?

800
00:56:24,224 --> 00:56:25,122
Let's walk and talk.

801
00:56:26,994 --> 00:56:28,689
You didn't really think
I'd let you go, did you?

802
00:56:29,296 --> 00:56:31,594
- I was kinda hoping you might, yeah.
- For her?

803
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:34,681
Please, Walken. We had such
a good working relationship.

804
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:37,749
Let's not end it like this,
like savages in a theme park.

805
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:39,953
You get the thumbs down
from the crowd, Hauser.

806
00:56:40,053 --> 00:56:40,952
You're obsolete, dude.

807
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:43,393
Past your expiration
date, discontinued.

808
00:56:43,493 --> 00:56:45,172
Garbagio, as they say in Latin.

809
00:56:45,813 --> 00:56:47,474
Relegated to the trash bin of history.

810
00:57:00,027 --> 00:57:02,677
You shouldn't rummage in the garbage.
Fuck.

811
00:57:02,777 --> 00:57:04,994
Is this one of those plastic
toys you can choke on?

812
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:07,999
You mother fucker!

813
00:57:32,426 --> 00:57:35,395
Help! I get it. I get it.
Help! Turn it off!

814
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:43,350
Ten minutes with Katie Couric would
get you ten times the audience...

815
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,384
of a whole season of Frontline.
Now, that's a fact.

816
00:57:45,484 --> 00:57:47,154
Yeah, but wh-why would they
want me to do the interview?

817
00:57:47,254 --> 00:57:48,970
You? Your uncompromising
integrity...

818
00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:51,859
your movie star good looks and
I don't think Katie Couric...

819
00:57:51,959 --> 00:57:53,845
wants to come to this beautiful
fucking vacation spot.

820
00:57:54,515 --> 00:57:56,732
You know I'm not gonna do
a P.R. puff piece, right?

821
00:57:56,832 --> 00:57:58,398
Just do the story.
Get the real girl.

822
00:57:58,498 --> 00:58:01,168
The real girl?
Is there anything real left to get?

823
00:58:01,268 --> 00:58:02,470
Can she actually talk?

824
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,204
She's just a needy
little kid, Natalie.

825
00:58:04,304 --> 00:58:07,272
I know, and she's spoiled, she's
over-sexed, she's tone deaf.

826
00:58:07,372 --> 00:58:08,610
Well she's a brand, Hauser.

827
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:10,186
Stuff happens.
She needs a mom.

828
00:58:10,964 --> 00:58:13,865
- Yeah. And don't look at me.
- I like looking at you.

829
00:58:16,036 --> 00:58:20,288
You can say anything you want, okay?
No holds barred delay. I'll make it live.

830
00:58:20,388 --> 00:58:22,854
You're crazy.
This bitch hates me.

831
00:58:22,954 --> 00:58:25,328
- She doesn't hate you.
- She hates me.

832
00:58:25,428 --> 00:58:27,607
- No she doesn't.
- She does. I know.

833
00:58:29,817 --> 00:58:30,700
Yeah, hello.

834
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,135
<i>I have lists of
Omar's whereabouts.</i>

835
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:34,016
I'll get to it.

836
00:58:34,688 --> 00:58:36,280
- Put your seatbelt on.
- Fuck off.

837
00:58:37,924 --> 00:58:38,652
Shit.

838
00:58:55,008 --> 00:58:56,532
So we're all set?

839
00:58:57,711 --> 00:59:00,145
This sucks.
I hate this.

840
00:59:01,682 --> 00:59:03,741
- What sucks, sweetheart?
- This location.

841
00:59:04,518 --> 00:59:05,849
What's wrong with it?

842
00:59:06,286 --> 00:59:09,221
I am not liking it.
It blows.

843
00:59:10,724 --> 00:59:14,706
This is 2000 years of Turaqi culture.
It's a nice spot for it, actually.

844
00:59:14,806 --> 00:59:15,887
Okay, sweetie?

845
00:59:18,098 --> 00:59:19,759
I want to do it...

846
00:59:22,035 --> 00:59:22,763
there.

847
00:59:25,572 --> 00:59:29,668
- We're all set up right here.
- There or nowhere.

848
00:59:31,912 --> 00:59:32,606
Okay?

849
00:59:35,182 --> 00:59:36,513
There's nice too.

850
00:59:38,385 --> 00:59:38,874
Hello.

851
00:59:40,921 --> 00:59:41,785
Hello.

852
00:59:54,001 --> 00:59:55,229
What is this place?

853
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:57,029
Beautiful.

854
00:59:58,438 --> 01:00:00,167
You see? She's just
a needy little kid.

855
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:05,240
This light is so cool.

856
01:00:07,815 --> 01:00:08,804
Look at this!

857
01:00:10,017 --> 01:00:10,779
Be careful.

858
01:00:19,026 --> 01:00:22,723
I want to do it here.
Come, inspect this from me.

859
01:00:23,731 --> 01:00:24,425
Beautiful.

860
01:00:25,032 --> 01:00:28,399
This place is so sad.
I love that.

861
01:00:29,369 --> 01:00:30,836
I'm going to see the rest.

862
01:00:37,177 --> 01:00:38,906
Hey, cowboy. You happen
to have a Cliff bar?

863
01:00:39,012 --> 01:00:40,001
- You hungry?
- I could eat.

864
01:00:40,113 --> 01:00:41,205
Let's find the kitchen.

865
01:00:42,749 --> 01:00:45,377
Look at this. An 82 margaux.
They must have left in a hurry.

866
01:00:46,453 --> 01:00:47,904
We can be shot
for looting.

867
01:00:48,004 --> 01:00:50,013
We can be shot for
anything in Turaqistan.

868
01:00:51,491 --> 01:00:53,755
Let's see. There must be
an opener here somewhere.

869
01:00:54,628 --> 01:00:57,244
I just don't know if I'm domestic
enough to make a meal out of...

870
01:00:57,344 --> 01:01:00,266
olives and caviar
and peanut butter.

871
01:01:01,268 --> 01:01:03,783
Yonica! There's food!

872
01:01:03,883 --> 01:01:05,270
Very high-tech
for Turaqistan.

873
01:01:06,907 --> 01:01:08,704
Crazy little brat.

874
01:01:09,009 --> 01:01:11,102
If she's a virgin...

875
01:01:11,478 --> 01:01:12,706
I'm Dick Cheney.

876
01:01:25,025 --> 01:01:26,424
Yonica, would you like some wine?

877
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:31,226
No. I hate wine.
It's so sour.

878
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:35,259
Milk is good.

879
01:01:42,509 --> 01:01:45,808
- I want a picture of you two.
- No pictures.

880
01:01:47,514 --> 01:01:48,481
Okay, one.

881
01:01:49,149 --> 01:01:49,979
Get in.

882
01:02:01,962 --> 01:02:03,327
So you two getting married?

883
01:02:08,635 --> 01:02:11,798
Because you are already
married with wife in America?

884
01:02:12,205 --> 01:02:14,366
Everybody wants
American wife.

885
01:02:14,874 --> 01:02:15,568
No.

886
01:02:16,343 --> 01:02:17,139
Never were married?

887
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,438
Was once actually.

888
01:02:24,017 --> 01:02:24,881
What happened?

889
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:30,814
It's not that interesting.

890
01:02:49,943 --> 01:02:50,967
What happened?

891
01:02:57,017 --> 01:02:58,848
Haven't spoken of it in a long time.

892
01:03:07,094 --> 01:03:08,152
<i>She was killed.</i>

893
01:03:09,262 --> 01:03:10,092
<i>Murdered.</i>

894
01:03:12,733 --> 01:03:15,668
I came home one night and my
beautiful wife had been slaughtered.

895
01:03:18,005 --> 01:03:23,170
I had a little girl
and she was taken.

896
01:03:24,845 --> 01:03:27,143
No ransom note, nothing.
Just gone.

897
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:31,448
- Why?
- I don't know.

898
01:03:32,853 --> 01:03:33,945
Who would do that?

899
01:03:34,588 --> 01:03:39,252
I don't know anything except
it was all because of me.

900
01:03:42,329 --> 01:03:43,261
What do you mean?

901
01:03:44,364 --> 01:03:48,164
I had many enemies.
I've done many things.

902
01:03:51,738 --> 01:03:55,105
What was her name?
Your daughter?

903
01:03:58,278 --> 01:03:58,869
Cara.

904
01:04:02,717 --> 01:04:03,877
There's a reason
I do this work.

905
01:04:08,088 --> 01:04:09,214
I don't have to feel anything.

906
01:04:11,759 --> 01:04:13,693
That's so fucked up.

907
01:04:17,697 --> 01:04:18,459
Hey. Whassup?

908
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:24,129
Get out!

909
01:04:26,873 --> 01:04:30,969
Sometimes I think is better
not to feel. Just skip it.

910
01:04:32,145 --> 01:04:33,942
How long can you
live that way?

911
01:04:34,514 --> 01:04:37,449
The poison's just old. It's
like a slow motion suicide.

912
01:04:37,852 --> 01:04:40,703
Or wake up every day and wonder if
you have the courage to walk away...

913
01:04:40,803 --> 01:04:44,917
to say: no, I won't do that. I'm
not that person. I'm not that thing.

914
01:04:50,897 --> 01:04:53,263
You think I should
not marry Ooq-Mi-Fay?

915
01:04:55,836 --> 01:04:57,428
<i>Hey, boss we have a problem.</i>

916
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,232
Hold that thought.

917
01:05:05,545 --> 01:05:06,944
What's the problem, guys?

918
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,046
Try some caviar.

919
01:05:15,655 --> 01:05:16,747
It's so good!

920
01:05:19,126 --> 01:05:19,956
I love.

921
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:22,951
My mom would always try to
get me to eat weird stuff.

922
01:05:23,096 --> 01:05:25,346
Tempeh and
wheatgrass...

923
01:05:25,446 --> 01:05:27,764
and all I ever wanted
was peanut butter.

924
01:05:30,704 --> 01:05:32,069
He's a complicated guy, huh?

925
01:05:35,942 --> 01:05:37,136
Not what'd you think.

926
01:05:44,451 --> 01:05:46,715
Hey, not so tough
today, huh?

927
01:05:51,024 --> 01:05:53,754
Hey, look, the little
girl has crowns.

928
01:05:54,461 --> 01:05:57,157
You think you can drown
me with the sheep shit.

929
01:05:57,964 --> 01:05:59,192
I don't think so.

930
01:05:59,866 --> 01:06:01,458
You want we should
take video now?

931
01:06:02,035 --> 01:06:03,195
Or kill him first?

932
01:06:03,969 --> 01:06:08,406
Be less blood if you kill me first, more
fun if you cut it off while I'm alive.

933
01:06:08,874 --> 01:06:09,921
- Shut up.
- Okay.

934
01:06:10,021 --> 01:06:13,593
I think I could take those two ears
and I can put them on my Harley.

935
01:06:13,693 --> 01:06:16,171
Maybe I can pick up
KROQ on my radio.

936
01:06:16,816 --> 01:06:19,011
Oh, pretty face. Bye.

937
01:06:23,089 --> 01:06:26,889
You ought to do some face.
Taste.

938
01:06:45,111 --> 01:06:45,805
Stay!

939
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:50,301
Cut off the fingers I
used to wipe my ass.

940
01:08:11,131 --> 01:08:13,065
I cannot believe you just did that!

941
01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:00,746
What person could squeeze
eyeballs from Bodhi Bhundhang?

942
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:06,408
And that asshole tells me
not to marry Ooq-Mi-Fay?

943
01:09:06,519 --> 01:09:08,701
I'm fucking marry Ooq-Mi-Fay.

944
01:09:08,801 --> 01:09:12,246
He's pig.
And I'm whore.

945
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:15,684
- You want me to take the freeway?
- Yeah. Whatever.

946
01:09:16,196 --> 01:09:19,893
It is who I am.
I am that person.

947
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,569
And if I'm going to be whore,
at least I can be rich.

948
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:27,918
I just want to make soulful
music and be sad and rich.

949
01:09:28,018 --> 01:09:30,339
You don't have to marry
some asshole to do that.

950
01:09:31,144 --> 01:09:34,375
Natalie, you will
be my bridesmaid?

951
01:09:36,549 --> 01:09:37,208
Please?

952
01:09:38,952 --> 01:09:43,514
My father, he's coming. I haven't
seen him since I was baby.

953
01:09:45,225 --> 01:09:46,783
It will be nice to meet him.

954
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:53,763
And if you are there
I will not be so afraid.

955
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:03,941
What am I gonna wear?

956
01:10:04,911 --> 01:10:07,729
- What about Katie Courich?
- Fuck her.

957
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:08,745
Fuck them all.

958
01:10:17,724 --> 01:10:19,089
Miami Beach Hotel.

959
01:10:22,028 --> 01:10:24,914
Jeff? I just sent you a photo
of that Tamerlane guy.

960
01:10:25,014 --> 01:10:28,817
He just slaughtered half a dozen
of Ooq- Mi-Fay Taqnufmini's posse...

961
01:10:28,917 --> 01:10:30,665
Find out who the fuck this guy is.

962
01:10:35,974 --> 01:10:38,465
<i>Hey. I just got this message
from the Viceroy.</i>

963
01:10:40,881 --> 01:10:45,113
<i>"We didn't front you $1.3 million to
whack a bunch of Fifty Cent wannabes.</i>

964
01:10:45,218 --> 01:10:49,302
<i>You know what I'm saying? You
got 18 hours to kill Omar Sharif.</i>

965
01:10:49,402 --> 01:10:51,470
<i>And may I just
add personally.</i>

966
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:53,924
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

967
01:10:54,327 --> 01:10:59,094
<i>Will you kill the mother fucker so we
can get the hell out of this shithole?</i>

968
01:10:59,466 --> 01:11:00,933
<i>What are you doing?</i>

969
01:11:01,067 --> 01:11:03,467
<i>Hello? Is there anyone in th-?</i>

970
01:11:09,709 --> 01:11:10,626
<i>Hey, it's Natalie.</i>

971
01:11:10,726 --> 01:11:13,577
<i>I'm either unmasking corporate
greed or washing my hair.</i>

972
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,578
<i>So leave a message.</i>

973
01:11:28,928 --> 01:11:30,657
That's good. Thanks. Great.

974
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:33,393
Is that good?

975
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,595
That looks great. Everything you're
doing is great. It's really great.

976
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:39,831
My communications degree
is finally paying off.

977
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,834
Where is Omar?

978
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:45,260
Well, let me check. Omar?

979
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,109
<i>- Camera Four, Marsha. Camera Four.
- Omar's Camera Four.</i>

980
01:11:48,214 --> 01:11:49,374
Why don't you pull in?

981
01:11:49,949 --> 01:11:51,198
Do you have his
Blackberry address?

982
01:11:51,298 --> 01:11:52,308
Laptop.

983
01:11:55,221 --> 01:11:57,803
By the way, Anderson Cooper
cannot make the wedding.

984
01:11:57,903 --> 01:12:01,383
- What room was he going to stay in?
- Eleven-oh-one.

985
01:12:05,732 --> 01:12:08,200
Just you, Cowboy.

986
01:12:15,074 --> 01:12:19,135
Oh, jeez. Gosh. By the
way. This came for you.

987
01:12:19,913 --> 01:12:20,538
I think...

988
01:12:21,949 --> 01:12:24,213
...It must have
been this morning and...

989
01:12:30,857 --> 01:12:32,173
<i>This is Natalie Hegalhuzen.</i>

990
01:12:32,273 --> 01:12:35,989
<i>I am being held by the Provisional
Liberation Army of Greater Turaqistan.</i>

991
01:12:36,696 --> 01:12:40,325
<i>I will be executed unless the
following demands are met by 6 pm.</i>

992
01:12:43,336 --> 01:12:48,171
The complete unconditional withdrawal of
all Tamerlane forces from Turaqistan.

993
01:12:50,176 --> 01:12:53,168
The dissolution of the criminal's
INS state of Israel.

994
01:12:54,213 --> 01:12:58,432
Three. The acquisition by the Turaqi
National Basketball team...

995
01:12:58,532 --> 01:13:02,318
of LeBron James for a player
to be named later.

996
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:06,584
I'm unhurt and
well-treated...

997
01:13:07,126 --> 01:13:09,094
And am right where I wanted to be.

998
01:13:10,163 --> 01:13:11,946
You're improvising, bitch.
I hate that!

999
01:13:12,046 --> 01:13:13,044
I know where she is.

1000
01:13:13,144 --> 01:13:15,883
No. Wait a second!
We're live in 6 hours.

1001
01:13:15,983 --> 01:13:17,319
I trust you.
You handle everything.

1002
01:13:17,419 --> 01:13:20,804
Oh, Jesus Mary and Joseph.

1003
01:13:24,744 --> 01:13:25,972
How are you, sir?
Nice to see you, sir.

1004
01:13:26,179 --> 01:13:26,770
You can go.

1005
01:13:35,688 --> 01:13:36,937
Jerry, how do I get to Fallaf?

1006
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:38,705
<i>Fallaf.
Are you out of your mind?</i>

1007
01:13:38,805 --> 01:13:41,851
<i>Here at GuideStar we definitely
call Fallaf a no-go zone.</i>

1008
01:13:43,129 --> 01:13:44,460
<i>That's snuff city, dude.</i>

1009
01:13:44,564 --> 01:13:46,746
Hey, don't get cute. Just
give me the damn directions.

1010
01:13:46,846 --> 01:13:49,049
<i>You sound a little angry, rather
emotional. It's a good thing.</i>

1011
01:13:49,149 --> 01:13:50,500
<i>Good. Let it go.</i>

1012
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:53,461
Is that the best you can do for
seventy-nine ninety-five a month?

1013
01:13:55,508 --> 01:13:57,806
Steven Seagal is like
500 pounds now.

1014
01:13:58,711 --> 01:14:01,475
They use body doubles for
everything, but this.

1015
01:14:04,217 --> 01:14:05,764
How many times do I have to tell you?

1016
01:14:05,864 --> 01:14:08,068
I am opposed to the occupation.

1017
01:14:08,168 --> 01:14:13,182
I have railed against it in every
significant journal in the world!

1018
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:21,959
I think you are mistaking me with
someone who actually gives a fuck.

1019
01:14:23,936 --> 01:14:25,652
Hey, you're just a
gift for us, babe.

1020
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,218
What do I do when
I get to Nafluni?

1021
01:14:27,318 --> 01:14:30,659
<i>There's a Mobil station
on your right. See it?</i>

1022
01:14:30,759 --> 01:14:31,959
Yeah. I think so.

1023
01:14:32,059 --> 01:14:35,106
<i>Great. Take the next
right. Follow the road.</i>

1024
01:14:35,982 --> 01:14:37,973
<i>If you're a praying man,
I'd start about now.</i>

1025
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:42,513
Can we kill her already?
I'm getting hungry.

1026
01:14:42,622 --> 01:14:45,386
We're still working out the
international distribution rights.

1027
01:14:48,695 --> 01:14:50,686
I want to...

1028
01:14:52,498 --> 01:14:54,432
put the camera
lower this time.

1029
01:14:55,002 --> 01:14:57,163
Oh, you mean like the construction
guard decapitation, huh?

1030
01:14:57,937 --> 01:14:59,888
But you want it from here to
there or from there to here?

1031
01:14:59,988 --> 01:15:01,836
- All the way.
- All the way's gonna be messy.

1032
01:15:01,941 --> 01:15:02,999
Yeah, but it's art.

1033
01:15:39,746 --> 01:15:41,976
- Do you have any candy?
- No. Get lost.

1034
01:15:42,849 --> 01:15:45,249
I told you these assholes
never have shit.

1035
01:15:46,419 --> 01:15:47,818
Looking for the kidnapped bitch?

1036
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:51,367
American?

1037
01:15:51,467 --> 01:15:54,052
We have three. Two yellow
hair and one dark hair.

1038
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,149
Dark hair.

1039
01:15:59,866 --> 01:16:00,491
Where?

1040
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:04,937
Show me.

1041
01:16:17,683 --> 01:16:25,647
10? No. How about 20?
Okay. It's a deal.

1042
01:16:26,759 --> 01:16:28,522
Shut up!
Let's do it.

1043
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,368
Don't shoot, man!

1044
01:16:41,073 --> 01:16:42,802
Hey, we're sorry. Chill.

1045
01:16:42,909 --> 01:16:44,759
I'm sorry, just take the girl.
We don't want the girl.

1046
01:16:44,859 --> 01:16:47,128
We just, we do movies, man.
We love to make movies.

1047
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:48,407
Yeah, yeah, movies.

1048
01:16:49,282 --> 01:16:50,806
Don't get up, guys.
We gotta run.

1049
01:16:55,454 --> 01:16:57,718
Fuck, dude. That was intense.

1050
01:17:00,226 --> 01:17:02,421
Okay. We're okay.

1051
01:17:08,301 --> 01:17:11,293
Next time bring
some candy asshole.

1052
01:17:12,939 --> 01:17:16,888
<i>Mr. Hauser? I told you Fallaf
was not a good idea, didn't I?</i>

1053
01:17:16,988 --> 01:17:20,059
<i>It's a no-go zone.
And you went.</i>

1054
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,613
<i>That was not a good idea.</i>

1055
01:17:32,725 --> 01:17:33,282
Get down!

1056
01:17:36,928 --> 01:17:37,485
Go.

1057
01:17:43,536 --> 01:17:45,970
Could you please try
to call Natalie again?

1058
01:17:52,111 --> 01:17:53,759
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1059
01:17:53,859 --> 01:17:55,860
What, my English
not so good?

1060
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,438
Come on.
I love you.

1061
01:17:59,852 --> 01:18:02,286
Come on here.
Come on here.

1062
01:18:13,399 --> 01:18:15,924
Get down, get down!

1063
01:18:21,507 --> 01:18:22,474
Get up.

1064
01:18:42,828 --> 01:18:44,043
Hey, you in charge?

1065
01:18:44,143 --> 01:18:47,246
- Who the fuck's in charge?
- No one! I'm no one!

1066
01:18:47,346 --> 01:18:49,767
- What are you lookin' at, bitch?
- I'm no one!

1067
01:20:10,282 --> 01:20:13,342
A couple of quick announcements.

1068
01:20:13,919 --> 01:20:17,650
The panel discussion, the Redemptive
Power of the Hedge Fund Derivative...

1069
01:20:18,124 --> 01:20:20,456
has been moved to the mini ballroom.

1070
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,452
Don't forget to go to the Meet
and Greet cocktail reception...

1071
01:20:24,997 --> 01:20:29,832
at the Tiki Room at five
and pick up your gift bags.

1072
01:20:30,236 --> 01:20:34,522
They've got a coffee mug
and a desert umbrella...

1073
01:20:34,622 --> 01:20:36,939
foam beer
Koozie and a...

1074
01:20:37,942 --> 01:20:40,457
autographed copy
from you know who...

1075
01:20:40,557 --> 01:20:44,414
of "How I Conquered the World and
Worked Out Issues With My Dad".

1076
01:21:37,303 --> 01:21:38,327
Take care of the kid.

1077
01:21:40,106 --> 01:21:41,471
'Cause I might have to go too.

1078
01:21:45,811 --> 01:21:46,903
You don't have to.

1079
01:21:49,181 --> 01:21:50,011
Yes, I do.

1080
01:23:23,842 --> 01:23:24,672
Natalie.

1081
01:23:25,177 --> 01:23:28,738
I saw your face and
creation held its breath.

1082
01:23:29,415 --> 01:23:30,677
I'm coming.

1083
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,088
No, no, no...

1084
01:23:44,363 --> 01:23:47,147
Silly me. I was expecting
a beautiful woman.

1085
01:23:47,247 --> 01:23:47,995
Sorry.

1086
01:23:48,467 --> 01:23:49,195
Hauser...

1087
01:23:49,868 --> 01:23:52,302
Love does get one into
difficult situations.

1088
01:23:53,239 --> 01:23:54,467
Somebody's gonna kill you.

1089
01:23:56,975 --> 01:23:57,999
It was supposed to be me.

1090
01:23:59,511 --> 01:24:00,739
Triple your security.

1091
01:24:02,047 --> 01:24:03,207
Stay off the streets.

1092
01:24:03,816 --> 01:24:06,250
With a little skill you
may actually stay alive.

1093
01:24:18,998 --> 01:24:21,296
- How may I thank you?
- No need.

1094
01:24:29,408 --> 01:24:31,876
We're in a constant
state of war, Hauser.

1095
01:24:32,878 --> 01:24:34,926
We kill our brothers,
complete strangers...

1096
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:36,174
the guilty and the innocent.

1097
01:24:37,851 --> 01:24:39,876
We are at war with
our own hearts.

1098
01:24:40,352 --> 01:24:43,150
Love is a cease-fire
that's destined to fail.

1099
01:24:43,922 --> 01:24:46,083
But, as I said...

1100
01:24:46,959 --> 01:24:49,427
it does get us into
tricky situations.

1101
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:54,264
Sometimes the back
of a garbage truck.

1102
01:24:59,271 --> 01:25:02,104
The ultimate Chickenhawk
is roosting close-by.

1103
01:25:09,982 --> 01:25:10,846
Good luck.

1104
01:25:24,163 --> 01:25:25,790
She says she's a bridesmaid.

1105
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:31,127
- You got an extra dress?
- Yes.

1106
01:25:32,771 --> 01:25:34,033
<i>For all of us at Tamerlane...</i>

1107
01:25:34,673 --> 01:25:37,390
<i>I extend a heartfelt
good luck and God bless...</i>

1108
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:38,909
<i>whoever that god may be.</i>

1109
01:25:39,411 --> 01:25:41,777
<i>To our happy young couple.
Shalom.</i>

1110
01:25:43,549 --> 01:25:44,072
<i>Shit.</i>

1111
01:26:08,273 --> 01:26:10,332
We have someone to do
your hair and makeup.

1112
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:12,709
I could do this.

1113
01:26:13,412 --> 01:26:14,879
Sit down!

1114
01:26:17,383 --> 01:26:18,372
Clean yourself!

1115
01:26:22,454 --> 01:26:25,946
We gotta go to the viceroy.
Where the hell is Hauser?

1116
01:26:27,459 --> 01:26:28,221
Asshole.

1117
01:26:30,896 --> 01:26:31,453
All right.

1118
01:26:35,467 --> 01:26:39,403
I am going to tell that bastard that
I want to go shopping in America.

1119
01:26:39,937 --> 01:26:42,963
And I never come back.
Can I stay with you?

1120
01:26:43,609 --> 01:26:45,804
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1121
01:27:00,592 --> 01:27:01,559
It's time.

1122
01:27:25,451 --> 01:27:28,769
Where are you?
I wanna see you.

1123
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:31,402
<i>Hauser. I'm about to
address the weddin'.</i>

1124
01:27:31,502 --> 01:27:33,390
<i>You're just gonna have
to wait 'til I'm done.</i>

1125
01:27:33,892 --> 01:27:35,120
I've waited long enough.

1126
01:27:51,777 --> 01:27:52,869
Hauser.

1127
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:57,878
Hello, Walken.
You look fabulous.

1128
01:27:58,550 --> 01:27:59,949
How did you know?

1129
01:28:00,552 --> 01:28:02,397
Where else would you be?

1130
01:28:02,497 --> 01:28:04,603
And going to the
Viceroy in five...

1131
01:28:04,703 --> 01:28:07,215
four, three, two...

1132
01:28:08,026 --> 01:28:10,377
<i>Wonderful opportunities
here, Hauser.</i>

1133
01:28:10,477 --> 01:28:14,762
<i>As long as these towel-heads don't
look up freedom in the dictionary.</i>

1134
01:28:14,867 --> 01:28:19,721
<i>To use one of your own homespun colloquialisms
let's cut the shit, shall we?</i>

1135
01:28:19,821 --> 01:28:21,020
That is your viceroy?

1136
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,768
You know what your problem is, Hauser?
You're a moralist.

1137
01:28:23,876 --> 01:28:26,728
That's why you're so
much fun to fuck with.

1138
01:28:26,828 --> 01:28:31,362
War is the improvement of
investments by other means.

1139
01:28:31,462 --> 01:28:35,784
For dummies. The USA is a
subdivision of Tamerlane.

1140
01:28:35,888 --> 01:28:39,335
Democracy, the war on
terror, the war on drugs...

1141
01:28:39,435 --> 01:28:42,552
these are all focus group
slogans for Tamerlane.

1142
01:28:42,661 --> 01:28:47,792
You murdered my wife.
And I'm here to kill you for that.

1143
01:28:47,899 --> 01:28:51,960
You were such a superb
killing machine, Hauser.

1144
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:53,037
What happened to you?

1145
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,774
You've had a whole week to kill Omar.

1146
01:28:56,275 --> 01:29:00,392
Of course I could have liquidated you
after you thought you'd killed me.

1147
01:29:00,492 --> 01:29:04,028
Right after I tried to kiss you and
you threw me in the garbage truck.

1148
01:29:04,128 --> 01:29:08,917
It's gonna be hard to torture
someone who's mostly dead.

1149
01:29:10,122 --> 01:29:11,885
But I'm gonna try...

1150
01:29:13,859 --> 01:29:14,973
to enjoy it.

1151
01:29:15,073 --> 01:29:19,463
But, by killing the woman
and kidnapping the girl...

1152
01:29:19,565 --> 01:29:20,395
Oh, my God.

1153
01:29:20,499 --> 01:29:22,215
<i>...that was so much more satisfying.</i>

1154
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:24,929
I left you in a state
of constant agony.

1155
01:29:25,037 --> 01:29:29,440
<i>You ever wonder what the ideology
of vibrio cholerae bacterium...</i>

1156
01:29:29,541 --> 01:29:35,025
<i>or the system of Yersinia pestis the
bacteria that causes bubonic plague.</i>

1157
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:36,341
I'll tell you, Hauser.

1158
01:29:37,082 --> 01:29:38,640
Perpetuation.

1159
01:29:39,184 --> 01:29:41,243
An infinite succession of generations.

1160
01:29:41,353 --> 01:29:43,548
Immortality on the installment plan.

1161
01:29:43,655 --> 01:29:45,838
I wish I had that
sort of esprit d'corps.

1162
01:29:45,938 --> 01:29:47,859
That bacterial team spirit.

1163
01:29:48,694 --> 01:29:52,960
Talk about legacy.
Talk about empire.

1164
01:29:53,999 --> 01:29:57,560
You're gonna tell me
what you did with her...

1165
01:29:59,738 --> 01:30:01,205
then I'm gonna kill you again.

1166
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,035
- Do you understand, old man?
- Don't you get it?

1167
01:30:04,876 --> 01:30:06,241
Your daughter happens...

1168
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,249
Shut it down!

1169
01:30:13,752 --> 01:30:15,379
<i>Your daughter, Hauser.</i>

1170
01:30:20,092 --> 01:30:27,464
Your daughter is about to be married.
And, Daddy you're the father of the bride.

1171
01:30:31,503 --> 01:30:34,301
God, that's a
conversation stopper.

1172
01:30:35,474 --> 01:30:37,965
Well, you just sit back
and enjoy the show.

1173
01:30:38,777 --> 01:30:41,337
You must be a real proud daddy.

1174
01:30:44,216 --> 01:30:45,274
Here she comes.

1175
01:30:49,554 --> 01:30:51,920
Ain't you the proudest daddy?
Look at that.

1176
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:53,382
She turned out good.

1177
01:30:53,792 --> 01:30:58,024
She looks good in that white dress
and those little white boots.

1178
01:31:02,267 --> 01:31:04,963
A white dress
and white boots.

1179
01:31:10,409 --> 01:31:11,239
Oh, look at that.

1180
01:31:11,810 --> 01:31:14,161
Don't you think the little
whore turned out well?

1181
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:17,762
I promised her Daddy would
be here. And here you are.

1182
01:31:17,862 --> 01:31:18,646
Shoot him!

1183
01:31:19,484 --> 01:31:21,315
The father of the bride!

1184
01:31:49,881 --> 01:31:51,940
Hauser!
Where are you, Hauser?

1185
01:31:52,818 --> 01:31:55,799
Come on, fight me like a dude.
Face me Hauser.

1186
01:31:55,899 --> 01:31:56,833
Come on!

1187
01:31:56,933 --> 01:31:59,618
I can control all of
this with my eyes.

1188
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:39,724
Yonica!

1189
01:32:42,033 --> 01:32:43,295
- Yonica.
- Shut the fuck up!

1190
01:32:44,703 --> 01:32:46,432
- Yonica. Yonica.
- Shut the fuck up! Shut up.

1191
01:32:49,207 --> 01:32:50,139
Get done, come on.

1192
01:32:50,942 --> 01:32:54,992
Dearly beloved, friends,
believers and infidels.

1193
01:32:55,092 --> 01:32:56,638
We are gathered here today...

1194
01:32:57,315 --> 01:33:01,235
to join together in holy
matrimony this man and this...

1195
01:33:01,335 --> 01:33:04,550
Yonica! Yonica!

1196
01:33:04,656 --> 01:33:05,315
Hauser!

1197
01:33:12,264 --> 01:33:15,756
You can't do this.
I won't let you.

1198
01:33:17,969 --> 01:33:19,095
I'm your father.

1199
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:23,098
Catch him.

1200
01:33:27,912 --> 01:33:28,708
It's me.

1201
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:33,146
I've loved you since the
minute you were born.

1202
01:33:33,752 --> 01:33:34,946
I will kill you!

1203
01:33:44,362 --> 01:33:45,488
It's gonna be okay.

1204
01:34:01,713 --> 01:34:03,681
We're gonna be a family again.

1205
01:34:21,833 --> 01:34:25,166
Come on!

1206
01:34:36,014 --> 01:34:37,730
Yonica, Yonica.

1207
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:38,976
Let go of that!
Don't do that.

1208
01:34:40,518 --> 01:34:41,985
What's going on?

1209
01:34:45,957 --> 01:34:46,651
Go, go, go, go, go!

1210
01:34:47,026 --> 01:34:47,890
Go, go, go!

1211
01:34:54,866 --> 01:34:58,393
Get me back to the bunker.
Headset.

1212
01:34:59,471 --> 01:35:00,904
Get me a tomahawk.

1213
01:35:02,006 --> 01:35:03,891
Blow this whole fuckin' place to shit.

1214
01:35:03,991 --> 01:35:04,752
Yes, sir.

1215
01:35:04,852 --> 01:35:08,006
Terrorists at the weddin'.
We've got 'em cornered.

1216
01:35:08,713 --> 01:35:10,704
So close to the bunker
could be dangerous, sir.

1217
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,709
Haven't you heard of
a surgical strike?

1218
01:35:15,687 --> 01:35:17,382
- Launch it.
- Firing two-one.

1219
01:35:31,503 --> 01:35:33,869
Viceroy coming through.
Viceroy coming through.

1220
01:35:35,807 --> 01:35:37,866
You should have let
me finish the job!

1221
01:35:52,991 --> 01:35:55,910
Tamerlane weapons are
precision-guided...

1222
01:35:56,010 --> 01:35:57,894
to minimize
collateral damage.

1223
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:02,561
Not only is our technology the
most advanced in the world...

1224
01:36:02,701 --> 01:36:05,750
but also with a smart
missile system...

1225
01:36:05,850 --> 01:36:08,718
we can launch a matchstick
in Milwaukee...

1226
01:36:08,818 --> 01:36:12,539
and stick it up the ass
of termite in Tehran.

1227
01:36:28,994 --> 01:36:30,188
Shit happens.

1228
01:36:39,971 --> 01:36:41,029
This blows.

1229
01:36:42,707 --> 01:36:45,801
"Killer, Whores and Jackals.
Behind Brand USA".

1230
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:46,793
Good title, huh?

1231
01:36:46,893 --> 01:36:47,727
It's a little wordy.

1232
01:36:47,827 --> 01:36:48,904
Vehicle from the front!

1233
01:36:51,449 --> 01:36:52,939
All right, that's it! Hold it!

1234
01:36:56,788 --> 01:37:00,383
We are going to honeymoon.

1235
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:04,760
Dude, it's the newlyweds!

1236
01:37:04,864 --> 01:37:05,679
Hey! Stand down!

1237
01:37:05,779 --> 01:37:10,326
Yonica, congratulations.
Your chariot's right this way.

1238
01:37:10,869 --> 01:37:11,767
Thank you.

1239
01:37:12,437 --> 01:37:15,201
- I have your poster on my wall.
- No, he's lyin'. It's my wall.

1240
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:17,867
I used to... no. Bye.

1241
01:37:32,457 --> 01:37:33,685
Run, run, run.

1242
01:37:34,225 --> 01:37:35,192
Run, run, run.

1243
01:37:38,963 --> 01:37:40,794
I cannot fucking believe this.

1244
01:37:43,001 --> 01:37:46,921
Yonica, I know I saved you but I don't
want you putting me up on a pedestal.

1245
01:37:47,021 --> 01:37:48,720
I'm just a person, just a man.

1246
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:50,240
Are you crazy? Where have you been?

1247
01:37:51,209 --> 01:37:53,939
- You are a fucking asshole, you know?
- Oh, I feel much better.

1248
01:37:54,846 --> 01:37:56,040
Go. Turn this thing on!

1249
01:38:01,586 --> 01:38:04,567
<i>So you don't want her to
be an assassin like you.</i>

1250
01:38:04,667 --> 01:38:07,136
<i>Well, don't worry because
I want to be like you.</i>

1251
01:38:07,236 --> 01:38:08,749
<i>- Yonica, don't be so sarcastic.
- I'm not.</i>

1252
01:38:10,628 --> 01:38:13,119
<i>- Where are we going?
- I don't know.</i>

1253
01:38:13,665 --> 01:38:14,981
<i>What do you mean, I don't know?</i>

1254
01:38:15,081 --> 01:38:16,715
<i>When I said I don't know,
it means I don't know.</i>

1255
01:38:16,815 --> 01:38:18,429
<i>- GuideStar!
- Welcome back, Mr. Hauser.</i>

1256
01:38:18,536 --> 01:38:20,527
<i>I can book you an hotel,
make you a dinner reservation.</i>

1257
01:38:20,638 --> 01:38:21,853
<i>You wanna just be spontaneous?</i>

1258
01:38:21,953 --> 01:38:25,225
<i>Spontaneous? It's Memorial Day
weekend, what if everything's full?</i>

1259
01:38:25,325 --> 01:38:27,194
<i>It's not gonna be full.
Jerry, am I right?</i>

1260
01:38:27,294 --> 01:38:28,825
<i>Don't get Jerry involved in this.</i>

1261
01:38:28,925 --> 01:38:30,730
Would you two stop fighting?

1262
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:32,632
We're not fighting.
We're just discussing.

1263
01:38:32,732 --> 01:38:34,602
<i>- It be sounding like fighting.
- Now she hates fighting.</i>

1264
01:38:34,702 --> 01:38:36,483
<i>Well, what do you expect?
Look at her father!</i>

1265
01:38:36,588 --> 01:38:38,602
This is the former vice
president speaking.

1266
01:38:38,702 --> 01:38:42,110
In response to the cowardly
and unprovoked terrorist...

1267
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:43,909
attack on the Emerald
City mall...

1268
01:38:44,009 --> 01:38:47,679
Tamerlane is pleased to announce
that it has been awarded the contract...

1269
01:38:47,779 --> 01:38:49,494
to preemptively strike Ugikistan...

1270
01:38:50,135 --> 01:38:52,649
which intelligence has
confirmed is behind this...

1271
01:38:52,749 --> 01:38:54,671
and hundreds of other
attacks in Turaqistan.

1272
01:38:55,206 --> 01:38:58,755
America cannot stand idly by and
allow hostile foreign powers...

1273
01:38:58,855 --> 01:39:00,674
to meddle in Turaqi affairs.

1274
01:39:01,079 --> 01:39:02,896
Intelligence has also conclusively stated...

1275
01:39:02,996 --> 01:39:06,333
that the Ugikis are developing
a nuclear arsenal...

1276
01:39:06,433 --> 01:39:10,080
and we cannot let the smoking gun come
in the form of a mushroom cloud.
