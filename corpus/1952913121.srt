1
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,060
- Ava, we've been dating
for 2 1/2 years,

2
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,020
and what I'm about to say,
I've considered very seriously.

3
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,900
I sound like a lawyer.

4
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,220
I look in your eyes,
and I drown in them.

5
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,940
Drown in them?

6
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,020
Babe, you know I'm bad
with telling you how I feel.

7
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,060
Will you be my wife?

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,420
Will you marry me?

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,540
Can we get married?

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,580
Ava.

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,740
You can do this.

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,980
It's, like, the little things
that I really love.

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,180
I find it so adorable

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,940
that you can't make a decision

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,860
without consulting
your horoscope.

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,860
I love that you watch the same
sad movie over and over again,

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,460
hoping for a happy ending.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,980
I love how you make
your coffee.

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,900
I love you, Ava, and I don't
want to spend another day

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,780
without knowing
if you'll be my wife.

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,020
So will you do me this honor?

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,300
Will you marry me?

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,300
- Brittany, Brittany,
this is Ryan.

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,380
Trust me,
you two have a lot in common.

25
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,820
Good to see you.

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,340
Where is Ava?
Go find your sister.

27
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,500
- All rise.

28
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,300
- Our wedding day was
the happiest day of my life.

29
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,260
I was marrying
the man of my dreams,

30
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,220
and our happily ever after
was about to begin.

31
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,580
Charlie and I met
once upon a time,

32
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,820
when I was getting my PhD
in psychology at Berkeley

33
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,180
and he was working
at a vineyard in Napa.

34
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,460
We fell in love
on the very first date.

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,140
He took me to an art fair
in San Francisco.

36
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,420
The next day, he surprised me
with a painting I had admired,

37
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,860
and I was hooked.

38
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,500
I believe lasting love
is possible

39
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,100
because of my parents.

40
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,500
Their 30-year union

41
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,020
is the reason I became
a marriage counselor

42
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,620
and why I was ready to make
the commitment myself.

43
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,140
- Mazel tov!

44
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,820
And that dimpled smile
doesn't hurt.

45
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,380
- So embarrassing.

46
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,220
Thank you.

47
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,380
I love you both.
I love you both.

48
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,780
I've known him my whole life,

49
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,140
and I still love you.

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,660
I can't even say that
about anyone else,

51
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,780
like, not even my own parents.

52
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,140
- Okay, we love you too,
Gerber.

53
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,180
- No, love, man.
Love.

54
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,660
That's what it's all about.

55
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,220
You know, from now on,

56
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,860
I'm gonna be
a one-woman guy.

57
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,820
- Per week?
- I'm serious.

58
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,420
Uh, hello?
We didn't actually...

59
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,580
- There he goes.

60
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,060
- Shelby, are you, like,
avoiding me?

61
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,140
Come on, we were in the middle
of talking about horses.

62
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,260
I love horses.

63
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,180
- You ready to get out of here,
Mrs. Dalton?

64
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,700
- I should warn you:

65
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,500
I've been saving a few tricks
for the honeymoon.

66
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,260
- Let's go.
- Okay.

67
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,220
Ready?

68
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,980
- Yeah!

69
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,900
Oh!
Oh, you got smoked.

70
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,580
In your face.
You got rocked.

71
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,740
- Black.
Two sugars.

72
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,340
- Two orders,
wheat toast with mayo.

73
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,940
Yum.
- The only way to eat toast.

74
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,700
- Your horoscope says,

75
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,380
"Today your positive
mental energy

76
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,100
will ensure that everything
goes your way.

77
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,020
Take advantage
of your good luck."

78
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,100
- That's great.

79
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,500
Maybe that means
this year's harvest

80
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,100
will be the vineyard's
best vintage ever.

81
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,340
- Fingers crossed.

82
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,340
- How about you skip out early,

83
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,740
take advantage of me tonight?

84
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,580
- Oh, I could cancel
my last couple.

85
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,260
- I'll reschedule my afternoon.

86
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,900
- See you at 6:00.

87
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,020
Let's take a minute
to validate those feelings.

88
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,820
It sounds like Lloyd
is feeling angry

89
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,180
because Courtney took advantage
of his credit card.

90
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,500
- She didn't take advantage
of it.

91
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,380
She raped it.
At Saks.

92
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,260
She roofied it,
bent it over, and...

93
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,260
- Okay.
Courtney raped your credit card.

94
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,780
And Courtney is still angry

95
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,380
because you slept
with another woman.

96
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,380
- "A slutty, trashy whore"
were my exact words.

97
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,460
- Obviously Courtney still
has some unresolved issues

98
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,540
about the affair.

99
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,220
- But 9 grand on shoes?

100
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,420
- Why should I suffer

101
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,140
just because you're not rich
like my father?

102
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,420
- If your father's so great,
why didn't you marry him?

103
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,100
- He wasn't available.

104
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,740
- I want you to think back
to when you first met.

105
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,420
What attracted you
to one another?

106
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,780
And I want you to make a list
of all of the qualities

107
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,780
that made you want
to get married.

108
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,620
The key to a successful marriage

109
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,220
is to find those qualities

110
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,820
that make you fall in love
with your spouse

111
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,140
all over again every day.

112
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,220
- Oh, I know they're here
somewhere.

113
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,100
Where are they?
Ugh.

114
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,860
- Shelby, what are you doing?

115
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,140
- Where do you keep
all your stuff?

116
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,140
- What stuff?
- The meds!

117
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,500
- I'm a psychologist,
not a psychiatrist.

118
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,940
I can't prescribe meds.

119
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,020
- Jesus, Ava.

120
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,500
That's the only reason
I took this job.

121
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,780
- I'm not even sure
they've invented a drug

122
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,380
to begin tackling your issues.

123
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,260
- Don't judge my pain.

124
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,380
You're my sister.

125
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,860
Can't you at least
refer me to someone?

126
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,260
- If I referred you
to a psychiatrist,

127
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,540
they'd have you committed.

128
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,740
- Would there be meds involved?

129
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,020
- And a straightjacket

130
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,620
Did you mail out
those invitations for me?

131
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,980
- For Mom and Dad's
surprise party?

132
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,060
- Yes.

133
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,340
- I got the guest list
right here.

134
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,260
- Thank you.

135
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,700
Glad that's not my next client.

136
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,900
- Darlings.
- Hi.

137
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,900
- Hi.
What was all the yelling about?

138
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,900
- Just your mother's
normal kvetching

139
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,940
- Oh, would you stop
talking like that?

140
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,780
This isn't a production
of Fiddler On The Roof.

141
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,940
- Would you just relax

142
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,820
and stop acting like
some kind of meshuggener

143
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,380
in front of our daughters?

144
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,940
- What does that even mean?
Jesus!

145
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,060
- Jewish.

146
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,420
- Okay, can we just take this
into my office, please?

147
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,940
Right into my office.
Thank you.

148
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,860
Come on.

149
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,340
All right.

150
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,940
Bradley, Betty,

151
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,300
why don't you calmly express
what's upsetting you?

152
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,460
- Well, I didn't want to have
to tell you this, Ava...

153
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,780
- No, Betty.
Don't tell her.

154
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,900
It'll break her heart.

155
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,900
- I want a divorce.

156
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,660
- What?

157
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,540
- Both of you-
everyone, take a seat.

158
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,180
Ooh, everybody calm down
and take a breath.

159
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,500
Okay.

160
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,460
Betty, what triggered
this decision?

161
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,140
- Your sack-of-shit father
cheated on me.

162
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,140
- We were separated.

163
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,700
We were separated at the time.

164
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,660
- Yeah, but he still managed
to knock me up.

165
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,540
Did we conceive Shelby
before or after your affair?

166
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,900
- Oh, my God.
Dad, explain.

167
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,660
- You were about three years old

168
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,340
when we were relocated to London
for my job,

169
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,820
and I was working overtime.

170
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,420
It was hardly a recipe
for a happy marriage,

171
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,620
so we decided to separate...

172
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,380
- Which for your father
meant doing it

173
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,220
With the first woman
he could find...

174
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,500
a minor detail he waited
25 years to tell me.

175
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,180
- Okay, I hear you.
I understand.

176
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,660
You feel betrayed,

177
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,660
and I'm not minimizing
what happened 25 years ago,

178
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,180
but is it really worth
throwing away

179
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,940
along and happy marriage?

180
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,980
- What makes you think
that I've been happy?

181
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,020
- Well, of course we're happy.

182
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,900
- Well, of course you're happy.

183
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,620
I've spent the best part
of my life

184
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,180
catering to your adulterous ass.

185
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,940
Now it's my turn.
I want to feel sexy.

186
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,420
I want to-
I want to have adventures.

187
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,500
- Okay.
Okay, Betty.

188
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,660
We're making some progress.

189
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,380
I want you both
to close your eyes,

190
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,820
take a deep breath,

191
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,580
and let's try and reconnect

192
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,060
with some of those feelings
you had

193
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,340
when you first decided
to get married.

194
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,500
- Ava, this Berkeley bullshit
isn't gonna work on me.

195
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,700
- Mom!

196
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,060
- Look, I'm sorry, darling,

197
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,860
but I'm not gonna take
marital advice

198
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,220
from my 28-year-old
newlywed daughter.

199
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,460
- I'm a professional.

200
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,740
- And you're
a hopeless romantic.

201
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,220
You've been watching
Gone With The Wind

202
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,820
every Thanksgiving
for the last 25 years.

203
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,140
- It's a very long weekend.

204
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,700
- And I would give it up, honey.

205
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,580
Rhett Butler's
never gonna stick around.

206
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,700
- But they were
at cross-purposes.

207
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,460
- You know, the point is that
I am the voice of experience.

208
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,180
I have done 30 years
of hard marriage,

209
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,180
30 years of lies and deceit,

210
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,060
and in all that time,

211
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,180
you've never once

212
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,660
put the toilet roll
back on the dispenser.

213
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,220
- And after 30 years, you'd
think she'd give it up, huh?

214
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,540
- Bradley, you can have
that bathroom all to yourself,

215
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,740
because I am moving in
with Shelby.

216
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,380
- Ava, you can't let Mom
move in with me.

217
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,820
- Okay, Mom, let's pause
and assess the situation.

218
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,820
We don't have to make
any permanent decisions today.

219
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,020
- Good-bye, Bradley.
Have a nice life.

220
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,660
-I refuse to live with Mom,
Ava.

221
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,780
- Okay, we have much bigger
problems here, Shelby.

222
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,420
- Yeah, like a 30th anniversary
party for a divorced couple.

223
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,740
- Hey, babe.
It's 6:00.

224
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,820
Time for our date.

225
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,940
I promise I'll hook up the dryer
this week, okay?

226
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,860
- I don't care.

227
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,500
- What's up?

228
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,180
- Today was probably
the worst day of my life,

229
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,780
and that's not an exaggeration.

230
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,580
- What happened?

231
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,940
- My dad had an affair.

232
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,100
- What?

233
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,820
- Before Shelby was born,

234
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,100
but my mom just found out,
and now she wants a divorce.

235
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,780
- That was 25 years ago.

236
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,060
- They were still married,
Charlie.

237
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,380
Oh...

238
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,260
They were so happy.

239
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,860
- So what are you gonna do?

240
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,580
- Technically I'm not supposed
to treat them

241
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,940
because we're family.

242
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,180
- So don't tell them
you're counseling them.

243
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,140
Do it without them knowing.

244
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,820
- Yeah, I could help them
surreptitiously.

245
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,260
- Where you going?
- To see my mom.

246
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,100
- Now?
What about our 6:00 date?

247
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,540
- The first 24 hours
of a separation

248
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,180
are critical, Charlie.

249
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,580
- Hello?
- Hey, Shel. it's me.

250
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,740
- Oh, my God.
You got to get up here.

251
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,740
She's driving me crazy.

252
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,180
Welcome to hell.

253
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,300
- Ava, shouldn't you be home

254
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,300
basking in your
newly wedded bliss?

255
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,340
- Mom, are you sure moving out
is the best solution?

256
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,140
- Well, I certainly can't live
in the same house

257
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,660
as my ex-husband.

258
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,180
Shelby, we need to move
the couch to the window.

259
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,460
- Uh, I like it where it is.

260
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,460
- No, you don't.

261
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,020
- You can't possibly be
considering getting a divorce

262
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,300
after all these years.

263
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,620
- This is between me
and yourfather.

264
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,980
- Little help, please!

265
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,140
- Okay, I completely encourage
your personal development, Mom,

266
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,180
but you can take time to work on
yourself and still be married.

267
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,980
- Well, it hasn't worked for me
so far.

268
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,220
Maybe it's time
I made myself happy.

269
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,620
- Are you really upset
about an old affair,

270
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,660
or are you just using that
as an excuse to leave?

271
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,820
- Ava, be my daughter,
not my therapist.

272
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,540
- I'm just trying
to understand the situation.

273
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,500
- It's complicated.

274
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,780
Why don't you ask your father
these questions?

275
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,220
- I'm going to,

276
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,940
but I really think you and Dad

277
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,820
would benefit from going to see
a counselor,

278
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,660
and I can recommend
someone great.

279
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,580
- I'm not really sure
I believe in therapy.

280
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,660
- Excuse me?

281
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,340
- Oh, not you, honey.

282
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,420
I thought your therapy today
was wonderful.

283
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,140
- Therapy can be really helpful.

284
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,780
I still go see my therapist
once a month for maintenance.

285
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,900
Well, I'll go.
If it'll make you happy.

286
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,500
- I thought it was time
to make yourself happy.

287
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,860
- I'm afraid that's all the time
We have for today.

288
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,340
It's really important for me

289
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,300
to get to know more
about both of you,

290
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,580
so I'm gonna need you
to fill out

291
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,740
these premarital
compatibility tests.

292
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,740
- Tests?
- More like questionnaires.

293
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,660
Don't worry. There are no
right or wrong answers.

294
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,660
Just be honest.

295
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,900
- Do we answer them
individually?

296
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,820
- Yes, and then I'll compare
your answers

297
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,660
to see how compatible you are.

298
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,100
So, Amy, you can stay in here,

299
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,020
and, John, why don't you
follow me out to reception?

300
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,540
- Okay.
See you.

301
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,420
- Thank you.

302
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,700
- Infidelity is one way

303
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,460
to discover if you still
really love your spouse.

304
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,380
Yeah.
You're welcome.

305
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,580
- Please tell me that was not
a prospective client.

306
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,300
- No.
They changed their mind.

307
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,860
And what the hell
is an angry pirate, anyway?

308
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,060
- Shelby.
- Back off.

309
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,940
- Give me my patient folders.

310
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,220
Give me...

311
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,060
- I'm all right.

312
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,780
- Uh-
- They're confidential.

313
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,020
- Party peeper.

314
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,020
- I am locking
the filing cabinet.

315
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,140
Have you talked to Dad?

316
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,540
I've been trying him
all afternoon.

317
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
I can't get a hold of him.

318
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,940
- You think he cashed in
his chips?

319
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,460
- Where do you come up
with this stuff?

320
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,380
- I was an unwanted child, okay?
I have issues.

321
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,980
And besides,
his wife of 30 years

322
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,260
just left him.

323
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,780
- I'm gonna run by the house
and check on him.

324
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,620
Will you collect their tests
when they're done?

325
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,860
- Sure.
I'll meet you there.

326
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,780
Wait.
Ava.

327
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,340
Mom and Dad, they're gonna
work it out, right?

328
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,780
- Of course.

329
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,460
It's only natural for marriages
to go through ups and downs.

330
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,060
- Okay, I just-I can't imagine
them not together.

331
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,260
- Don't worry.

332
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,500
Once they get into therapy,

333
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,420
they'll fall in love
all over again.

334
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,420
Trust me.

335
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,140
- You put B for number 20?

336
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,780
- Yeah, she said there were
no right or wrong answers.

337
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,820
- I'd go with C.

338
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,140
- But she said to be honest.

339
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,260
- Do you want to get married
or not?

340
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,460
- Dad?

341
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,500
Dad, are you here?

342
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,980
Dad?

343
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,820
Dad?

344
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,380
I know Tae Bo!

345
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,860
- It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

346
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,460
- Don't worry, sweetheart.
It's just the deli delivery boy.

347
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,340
- Matzo ball soup.

348
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,460
I'll just put it
in the kitchen.

349
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,780
- You scared me.

350
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,780
- My apologies.

351
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,260
- Why are you in the dark?

352
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,340
- It's the Sabbath.

353
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,620
- So this isn't
a sign of depression?

354
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,340
- Well, I'll just head out,
then.

355
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,260
- Yeah.

356
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,140
Yeah, thank you,

357
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,340
deli delivery boy
from the local deli.

358
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,540
- I was so worried.
I called you all afternoon.

359
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,740
- I'm sorry, hon.

360
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,180
You know,
in the Orthodox tradition,

361
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,980
We're not allowed
to answer the phone.

362
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,180
- Ugh.
Would you knock it off?

363
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,500
You've never been
this Jewish before.

364
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,780
- I've always been Jewish.

365
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,100
- You've never been religious.

366
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,620
You were always the first dad
on the block

367
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,620
to go out and buy
a Christmas tree.

368
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,340
- Well, I wanted to be
a perfect father to you girls.

369
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,620
I still do.

370
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,180
You don't really need me
anymore.

371
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,860
You got Charlie.

372
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,660
And being Jewish is the only
thing that feels familiar.

373
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,340
- Sometimes change
can be positive.

374
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,740
You and Mom could use this time
to improve your relationship.

375
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,020
- I just want things
the way they were.

376
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,740
- I think you're using
your spirituality

377
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,620
to avoid dealing
with the fact that Mom left.

378
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,500
- Are you analyzing me, Ava?

379
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,020
- No, no.

380
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,660
I'm just suggesting

381
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,420
maybe you do something
to make Mom want to come back.

382
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,740
- Well, I'm her husband.
This is her home.

383
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,180
That should be enough.

384
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,740
- I want a pony!

385
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,060
- What?

386
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,500
- Well, if you're not gonna act
your age, neither am I.

387
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,140
- Glad to know you're alive.

388
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,300
- Hi, Shel.

389
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,420
- Who was the hottie?

390
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,500
- Nobody.

391
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,660
- Just the local
deli delivery guy.

392
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,900
Oh, maybe Dad
could hook you up.

393
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,780
- Ooh, I could go for some
of those matzo balls.

394
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,020
- Shelby.
- Touchy.

395
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,100
What's with all the candles?

396
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,340
- Dad's being Jewish.

397
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,060
- So this is what it's like
to be Jewish.

398
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,100
- Mom agreed to go see
a marriage counselor.

399
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,180
- She did?

400
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,020
- I could set you up
with a fantastic therapist.

401
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,420
- You think that would help?

402
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,420
- I think I want to be Jewish.

403
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,100
- What?
- What?

404
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,220
- You're getting a pony.
I want a bat mitzvah.

405
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,420
- Oh, don't make
any sudden movements.

406
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,460
- Don't hate me...

407
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,100
- Okay, knock if off, you two.

408
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,660
Hi.

409
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,220
I'm just kidding.

410
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,260
- Dad, why don't you go get
settled up in the guest room?

411
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,380
- Oh, yeah, thanks, honey.

412
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,460
It'll be fun to have
some company.

413
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,940
Huh?

414
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,860
- Ava?

415
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,860
- I went over to go see my dad,

416
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,060
and he was all alone
in the dark.

417
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,820
He's so depressed.
- Is he moving in?

418
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,380
- Only for a couple days.

419
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,820
- Your father
cannot live here, Ava.

420
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,660
It's only temporary.

421
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,780
- Yeah?

422
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,260
Then why did he bring
his goldfish?

423
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,820
- Couldn't get him to leave
without Malcolm.

424
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,500
- Malcolm?
Really?

425
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,740
We're supposed to make
decisions like this together.

426
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,860
- Please.
Please.

427
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,260
- Okay.
But just for a few days.

428
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,060
Gerber.
- Hey.

429
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,020
- What are you doing here?

430
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,540
- Oh, buddy.
Where's Ava?

431
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,980
Hey.
- Hi.

432
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,060
- There's someone
I'd like you to meet.

433
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,020
Guys, this is Keisha.

434
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,300
- Nice to meet you.

435
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,300
- My wife.

436
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,460
- What?
- Huh?

437
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,380
- My wife.
I finally pulled the trigger.

438
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,340
- When?

439
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,460
- Today.

440
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,660
Charlie, you were right.

441
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,660
You know the moment
you meet your wife.

442
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,060
- Congratulations.
Ah!

443
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,860
Oh, my gosh.

444
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,620
- I didn't even know
you were dating.

445
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,100
- Buddy.
- You move fast.

446
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,980
- Well, I had to.
Her visa's up in a week.

447
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,620
If I'd let her go back
behind the iron curtain,

448
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,420
I might never have seen
my little Polish princess

449
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,740
ever again.

450
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,620
- There's no iron curtain
anymore, Gerber.

451
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,540
- Yeah, tell that
to immigration.

452
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,700
- So... where did you meet?

453
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,900
- Oh, thank you.

454
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,540
- You are ridiculously cute.

455
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,940
She's still working
on her English.

456
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,740
- How did you meet her?

457
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,660
- Well, last night,
I went to a bar,

458
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,580
and I ordered a shot of vodka...

459
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,540
- Vodka?

460
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,060
- Vodka.
In Charlie's honor.

461
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,340
- My honor?

462
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,380
- For a fallen comrade.

463
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,580
- But you don't even
drink vodka.

464
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,980
-I know.
That's the most amazing part.

465
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,740
It was handed to me
by this Slavic goddess,

466
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,060
and at that moment, I knew.

467
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,580
It was fate.

468
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,620
- Gerber, that is so romantic.

469
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,540
Welcome to our country.

470
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,580
- Oh, thank you!

471
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,140
- Her English is great.

472
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,020
-Oh...

473
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,900
We got you a wedding present!

474
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,660
Uh-oh.
Look what happened.

475
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,300
- Thanks, Gerber.
- Thank you.

476
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,300
- Thank you.
- It was nothing.

477
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,620
Besides, us married folk
should stick together.

478
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,380
-I hate Gerber.

479
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,940
- Doesn't he know
we have to wake up early?

480
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,220
- He promised
this was their last song.

481
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,660
- ♪ We've been together

Let's take the party upstairs,
please.

500
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,020
- Ava!
Ava, you got to try this.

501
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,340
I mean, you push a button,

502
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,620
and the music comes out,

503
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,300

510

- Hey, babe.
Come see me at the winery.

511
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,180
We'll have lunch
at the vineyard cafe.

512
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,380
- Charlie, Ava's here
in the vineyard garden.

513
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,940
- He loves you.

514
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,220
- I wasn't doing that.
It's just a nervous habit.

515
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,380
- Right.

516
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,780
- I'm meeting the caterer here
in an hour to discuss the party.

517
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,060
- You aren't canceling
the party?

518
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,940
- No.
It's in three weeks.

519
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,820
They're gonna be
back together by then.

520
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,460
- I have total faith in you,
babe,

521
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,140
but you may want to consider
the possibility

522
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,780
that they don't
get back together.

523
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,380
- What kind of marriage
counselor would I be

524
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,820
if I took that approach?

525
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,420
Besides, my horoscope today

526
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,820
said that I can achieve
whatever I set my mind to.

527
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,460
- Here it is.

528
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,780
- Thanks, Adrianna.

529
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,500
- Charlie, your interview
with Wine magazine

530
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,620
is confirmed for 3:00.

531
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,100
Hi, Ava.
- Hi.

532
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,380
-I had a great time
at the wedding.

533
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,620
You looked very pretty.

534
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,180
- Thank you.

535
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,660
- So I had this made for us.

536
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,780
- What?

537
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,980
- It's a belated
wedding present.

538
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,540
- Wow.
Okay.

539
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,460
- Our own vintage.

540
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,780
We'll open it
on our tenth anniversary,

541
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,620
and, like our marriage,
it will only improve with age.

542
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,020
- This was so sweet of you.

543
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,660
- It was, wasn't it?

544
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,900
- Come here.

545
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,260
Thank you.

546
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,420
- Charlie.

547
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,100
My dad's staying
in the next room.

548
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,500
- Ah, come on.

549
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,020
Come on.

550
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,740
Bradley.
- Oh, morning, Charlie.

551
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,700
Yeah.
Oh, I didn't wake you, did I?

552
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,860
-Oh, no.
I was up.

553
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,420
- Dad, what are you doing?

554
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,220
- Putting up a mezuzah.
You didn't have one.

555
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,740
- We're not Jewish.
- It's crooked.

556
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,940
- Yeah, well, it doesn't hurt

557
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,580
to have a little blessing
on your home.

558
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,660
I thought Charlie could use
some help with those pictures.

559
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,740
- Uh, that really
wasn't necessary,

560
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,580
and I prefer to do that type
of thing on my own,

561
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,940
and I'm actually quite obsessed
with my paintings and...

562
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,700
- But it was very thoughtful
of you to want to help.

563
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,100
- Oh, and, Dad, don't forget,

564
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,620
you and Mom have a meeting
with the therapist tonight.

565
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,340
I've heard great things
about him.

566
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,660
- Yeah.

567
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,820
- I'm gonna make some coffee.

568
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,420
Bradley, do you want some?

569
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,500
- Is it kosher?

570
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,500
-I have no idea.

571
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,380
- Then I'll pass.

572
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,780
- I can't imagine why she left.

573
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,980
- Betty.

574
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,900
Bradley.

575
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,980
Entrez.

576
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,300
There's an exercise
I like to do

577
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,580
with all my patients
before they sit down,

578
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,460
Sort of a ritual.

579
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,620
So start out by taking
short, quick breaths

580
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,140
through the nose, like this.

581
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,620
Now I want you to shake out
your body, like this.

582
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,540
Then hop up and down like this.

583
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,100
This is wonderful

584
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,020
for igniting your chakra energy.

585
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,500
Hop, hop, hop.

586
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,900
- More like
ignite your sphincter.

587
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,060
- Shake out.
Shake out.

588
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,780
- Who's that?

589
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,900
- Adrianna.

590
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,820
I swear, if Gerber's not here
in the next five minutes,

591
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,620
We're ordering without him.

592
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,580
What's that?

593
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,020
- It's a Polish phrase book.

594
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,220
I though it might help us get
to know Kasha a little better.

595
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,300
- Yeah?

596
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,700
What's Polish for "green card"?

597
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,380
- Don't be so cynical.
They're in love.

598
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,020
- They don't even speak
the same language.

599
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,380
- Did you know there are
five love languages?

600
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,460
Not all of them are verbal.

601
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,460
- Seriously?

602
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,580
You're the one saying

603
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,700
that marriage takes work,
commitment...

604
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,300
- But the falling-in-love stage
is the best part.

605
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,300
- Wow.
I guess the honeymoon is over.

606
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,460
- Baby, I fall in love with you
all over again every day.

607
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,660
- Hi.
Sorry we're late.

608
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,620
- Okay.

609
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,740
- Mwah, mwah.

610
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,700
-Oh.

611
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,980
- Three.
- Three times.

612
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,260
- Thank you.

613
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,140
- Ha-ha!
Ha-ha!

614
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,060
Wonderful, you two.

615
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,060
Natural hoppers,
the both of you.

616
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,380
Let's have a seat.

617
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,500
What I need to know
is how you feel,

618
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,220
right here, right now.

619
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,540
- Winded.

620
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,500
I meant emotionally.

621
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,420
- I feel humiliated.

622
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,580
- Yeah, me too.

623
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,060
Oh, you might want to rethink
that whole hopping ritual.

624
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,180
- I meant by your affair.

625
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,420
And now you won't even
tell the girls about Ian.

626
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,460
I feel like the last 25 years
of our marriage

627
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,020
was nothing but a sham,

628
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,020
built on secrets and deception.

629
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,220
- She's got you there, Bradley.

630
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,580
- Excuse me?

631
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,020
- You had the affair.

632
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,860
She posted the first points.

633
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,340
What's your comeback?

634
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,420
- Are you keeping score?

635
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,140
- It helps me figure out
Who's to blame.

636
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,420
-Oh, yeah.
Mmm.

637
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,540
That is a perfectly cooked
steak.

638
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,700
How's your dinner, babe?

639
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,980
- It's cost my arms and legs.

640
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,420
- Um, it's arm and leg.

641
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,260
It's an arm and leg.

642
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,700
- An arm?
- An arm and leg.

643
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,020
- And leg.
- It costs an arm and leg.

644
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,460
- It costs an arm and leg.

645
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,020
- How cute is that?
That is cute.

646
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,820
Oh, as I keep explaining
to these officials,

647
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,740
that we had to get married
in a hurry

648
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,100
because her visa's running out.

649
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,460
- You didn't actually say that.

650
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,500
- You told me to be honest.

651
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,340
- Yeah, but I meant tell them
that you're so in love,

652
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,660
you couldn't wait
to get married,

653
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,820
not, "Let's do it
before she gets deported."

654
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,300
- Well, I can't think
of a better reason

655
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,620
to get married on the fly.

656
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,780
Not like "I'm drunk
and in Vegas"

657
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,740
type deal, right, buddy?

658
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,700
Ow!

659
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,020
That was one
of your dumber ideas.

660
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,420
- What was a dumb idea?

661
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,100
- Oh!
Charlie!

662
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,660
- I'm so sorry, buddy.

663
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,900
- Okay, now a little
to the right.

664
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,420
There you go.
Ooh, bull's-eye.

665
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,460
Whoop.
No lookee.

666
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,020
- Maybe you should go home
and change.

667
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,420
- Charlie, what's with you?

668
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,740
- He's like Edward Scissorhands.

669
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,260
♪ Clumsy ♪

670
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,420
You got to live with that.

671
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,100
Now I know
why your first wife left you.

672
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,180
Oh!

673
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,660
- Okay.
I'm okay.

674
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,380
I'm okay.
You're okay?

675
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,460
- First wife?
What-what's he talking about?

676
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,100
- You never told her?

677
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,540
- When do you intend
to tell our daughters?

678
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,740
- I don't.

679
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,900
- Tell them what, Bradley?

680
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,860
- Nothing.

681
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,660
- Oh, for God's sakes.

682
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,380
You're not even gonna tell
our therapist about Ian?

683
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,620
- This is a private matter,
Betty.

684
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,060
He's a stranger.

685
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,780
- This is exactly your problem.

686
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,940
You're afraid of change.
You're afraid of anything new.

687
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,340
Do you know that he's eaten
the same breakfast

688
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,620
every morning
for the last 30 years?

689
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,220
Oatmeal,
without even any fruit on it,

690
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,700
the same bland, boring thing.

691
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,340
- I'm a traditionalist.

692
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,740
- Well, I am sick of it.

693
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,300
And until you are willing
to embrace

694
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,460
the new possibilities
that life is offering you, l...

695
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,700
I can't be with you.

696
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,860
- I'm prescribing

697
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,700
a method of therapy

698
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,740
which I have found
extremely successful.

699
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,460
It's called

700
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,540
"Brush with Death."

701
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,700
It means time apart,

702
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,740
during which you don't
see each other

703
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,740
or talk to each other.

704
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,540
And no phone calls.

705
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,740
- I'm in.

706
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,780
- I should have said something.

707
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,540
It was annulled, which is almost
like it never happened.

708
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,140
I was drunk in Vegas.

709
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,780
I didn't even know the girl.

710
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,780
It doesn't count
as a real marriage.

711
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,260
- I can't believe you kept this
a secret from me.

712
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,540
- I didn't want
to disappoint you.

713
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,180
- How could you do something
so stupid?

714
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,020
- I was 22.

715
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,060
- That's old enough
to know better.

716
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,980
- Technically that's only
2 times 11.

717
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,980
- In what, guy years?

718
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,020
I don't-
I don't care what you did at 22.

719
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,260
I care that you lied to me now.

720
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,820
- I didn't lie to you.

721
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,500
- By omission.

722
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,300
It's the same thing.

723
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,580
How am I supposed to trust you?

724
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,540
- A brush with what?

725
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,660
- Death.
A Brush with Death.

726
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,300
It's ridiculous.

727
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,020
Is that a way
to save a marriage?

728
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,220
- His methods
are a little unorthodox,

729
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,060
but he usually gets
great results.

730
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,980
- Excuse me.

731
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,380
I'm gonna go have
a brush with death.

732
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,580
- You have to help me
with this.

733
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,540
- What can I do?

734
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,420
- I just figured,
with your prior experience,

735
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,940
you would know
all about marriage.

736
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,380
- Jesus, Ava.

737
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,820
You can't punish me
for something I did

738
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,340
years before we even met.

739
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,940
- It hurts knowing
I'm not the only girl

740
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,700
you ever wanted to marry.

741
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,420
It spoils the fairy tale.

742
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,740
- If it makes you feel
any better,

743
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,660
you're the only one
I married sober.

744
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,420
I'm sorry.

745
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,860
You're the one, Ava.

746
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,380
I love you.

747
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,940
What can I do
to make you feel better?

748
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,780
- Help me with my parents.

749
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,180
- Divorce is difficult, Ava,

750
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,180
but my parents are happier
now that they're not together.

751
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,780
- Do you think if my parents
get divorced,

752
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,540
my Dad's gonna want to go home
to an empty house?

753
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,460
- You're just playing dirty now.

754
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,940
- I just need you on my team.

755
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,820
-Okay.
I'm in.

756
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,820
- Ugh.

757
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,660
Worthless trash.

758
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,660
- What did it say?

759
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,180
- "Avoid all team sports."

760
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,620
- Dr. George was quite specific
when he said "Brush with Death."

761
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,820
It meant no contact.

762
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,260
- Yeah, but I figured
you and Dad

763
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,220
would probably respond better
to a more traditional method.

764
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,580
- Bradley.

765
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,380
You want to squeeze in a workout
after this?

766
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,620
- Oh, I already got my
squat thrusts in this morning.

767
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,940
- Please, you haven't
thrust anything in years.

768
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,780
- Welcome, everybody,
to Miraculous Marriages.

769
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,260
Freak out the fear!

770
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,020
Now, if I could get everybody
to gather round.

771
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,300
Gather round.

772
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,820
Get over here!

773
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,180
Okay, people, eyes here.

774
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,420
First, let's start
with our affirmation of the day.

775
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,940
Marriage to the max.
Marriage the max.

776
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,540
Marriage to the max.

777
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,220
Marriage to the max.

778
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,020
Marriage to the max.

779
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,100
- Everybody.
Marriage to the max.

780
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,700
Marriage to the max.

781
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,660
Marriage to the max.

782
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,300
- Wonderful.

783
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,900
Now for our first exercise,

784
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,180
We're going to start
a word association game.

785
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,940
I'm going to say a word,

786
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,100
and everybody is going to say
the first word

787
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,340
that pops
into their little head.

788
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,060
Now, remember,
say everything you feel.

789
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,380
There is no judgment here.

790
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,540
Let's start with you!

791
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,300
Newlywed!

792
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,220
- Commitment.

793
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,340
- Love.

794
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,300
- Wedding!

795
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,540
- Expensive.

796
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,500
- Cheap.

797
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,460
- Love!

798
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,340
- Cooking.

799
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,380
- Grateful.

800
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,060
- Oh, baby.

801
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,460
- Home!

802
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,180
- Sharing.

803
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,460
- Ooh, clothes.

804
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,420
- Husband!

805
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,420
- Hurt.

806
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,420
- Happy.

807
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,460
- Marriage!

808
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,820
- Can I just say
I love this exercise?

809
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,380
I actually use it
in my own practice.

810
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,460
- Stop right there!

811
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,020
One word.

812
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,500
- Disillusionment

813
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,900
- Disillusionment?
Already?

814
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,500
- Not us.
Them.

815
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,300
- This exercise is about us,

816
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,980
what marriage means to you.

817
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,980
- Enough!

818
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,620
One word.

819
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,020
- Bliss.
"Bliss" is my word.

820
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,380
- Imperfections
- Imperfections?

821
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,420
Are you talking
about your first wife or me?

822
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,780
- I was talking about me.

823
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,500
- Whatever.
Your word blows.

824
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,580
- This a no-judgment circle,
Ava.

825
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,860
- Next!

826
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,780
-Oh!

827
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,100
Thanks for catching me.

828
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,540
- I should have let you fall.

829
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,940
- I guess I would have
deserved that, huh?

830
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,860
- Old habits die hard,
I suppose.

831
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,660
- This is all about building
trust with your partner.

832
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,180
-Oh!

833
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,340
Ava.

834
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,140
- Move faster, sir.

835
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,220
Girl in the green sweater,

836
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,020
please don't hold
your wife's hand.

837
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,620
- Go, team us!
Go, team us!

838
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,100
All right, baby.

839
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,020
- Love you.
- I love you.

840
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,820
- Maybe I should go first.

841
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,780
- Would you give me some more
rope, you cheap bastard?

842
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,140
It's not even
your damn rope anyway.

843
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,780
- We have to use the line
sparingly.

844
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,380
I'm not sure how much is left.

845
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,700
- Trust your partner.

846
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,540
Embrace the mountain.

847
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,140
- Good job, babe.

848
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,300
- Work together as a team.

849
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,940
Come on, Betty!
Freak out the fear.

850
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,660
Freak out the fear!

851
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,340
- Fear is freaking me out.

852
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,340
- Mom, come on.
You can do it.

853
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,420
- Come oh, Betty.
- Bradley, this is too high.

854
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,300
I can't go any further.

855
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,300
- Come on, Betty.

856
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,060
Don't be such a baby.

857
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,580
- Fine.
That's real supportive.

858
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,060
- Betty, your ass
is on my shoulder.

859
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,260
How much more supportive
do you want me to be?

860
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,220
- Then move.
I don't need you.

861
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,620
- Fine!

862
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,460
- Mom, I'm coming!

863
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
-Ah!

864
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,540
- Oops.

865
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,100
Well, the good news is,

866
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,500
you only have to wear the brace
overnight.

867
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,660
- Yeah, and the bad news is,

868
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,260
my wife tried to kill me.

869
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,300
- Charlie, come on.
It was an accident.

870
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,820
I got distracted.

871
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,180
- By your parents.

872
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,500
- What am I supposed to do,

873
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,660
just stand back and let them
throw their marriage away?

874
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,340
- They're the ones
getting divorced.

875
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,500
Why are we the ones
suffering for it?

876
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,940
- Oh, Moses,

877
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,540
another one of Mom's
indecipherable texts.

878
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,460
- Don't tell her we're going
to the florist, please.

879
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,940
- "Getting coffee
on Magazine Street."

880
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,420
So since Dad
is staying with you,

881
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,740
Shabbat at your place?

882
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,420
- What?
- Shabbat dinner.

883
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,780
It's like Thanksgiving
for Jews.

884
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,580
The whole family gets together
to eat and argue,

885
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,020
but they do it every week.

886
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,100
So is it at your house?

887
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,580
- No, it's not at our house.

888
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,980
- You're a bad Jew.

889
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,540
- Shelby, I'm not Jewish,
and neither are you.

890
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,940
- You better hope God
didn't hear you say that.

891
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,500
- Crap.

892
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,900
Mom found us.

893
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,740
- Hi, babies!

894
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,580
I have exciting news.

895
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,980
- You and Dad
are back together?

896
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,140
- No, I'm going to Thailand...

897
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,100
and India, China, Japan,

898
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,700
maybe even Tahiti.

899
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,860
- Oh, let's grab this table.

900
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,900
- But Dad hates to fly.

901
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,620
- Oh, I'm not going
with your father.

902
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,620
- And how long will you be gone?

903
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,980
- About six months.

904
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,180
- So I'll have the apartment
all to myself again?

905
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,340
- How could you do this to Dad?

906
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,180
- It's always been my dream
to travel.

907
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,500
Well, you got to go to France
your junior year of college,

908
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,700
and Shelby had those two months
when she went missing in Mexico.

909
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,940
- Ay de mi.
Tiempos mas buenos.

910
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,500
- Your father's been afraid
to travel,

911
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,940
and this is my chance
to see the world.

912
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,420
- This isn't like you, Mom.

913
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,580
- No?
No, it's not like me at all.

914
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,660
I always do
what everybody else wants.

915
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,460
One day, you'll understand.

916
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,460
- No, I won't, because I would
never give up on my marriage.

917
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,700
- Like Miss Perfect would ever
have marital problems.

918
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,060
- Actually, I just found out
that Mr. Perfect

919
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,540
has been keeping a big secret
from me.

920
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,060
- Is he cheating on you
with his hot assistant?

921
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,260
- Shelby.
- Charlie's not cheating on me.

922
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,420
- How do you know?

923
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,340
Do you monitor his calls,
check his texts?

924
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,740
- No, 'cause I'm not a psycho.

925
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,180
- Such an amateur.

926
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,020
- Charlie would never cheat.

927
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,420
- That's what I thought
about Dad.

928
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,900
- Men aren't perfect, honey.

929
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,380
They're just men.

930
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,660
- All of them?

931
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,580
- Yes, dear, all of them.

932
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,740
- Damn.

933
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,700
- Mwah.
Mwah.

934
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,700
Bye, babies.

935
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,740
- Roses or orchids
for the centerpieces?

936
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,340
What do you think?

937
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,460
- I think we should
sincerely contemplate

938
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,940
changing the theme
of this party, Ava.

939
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,660
- Shelby, come on.
I need help.

940
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,180
- Yeah, you do.

941
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,700
Mom's leaving in ten days,
and the party's in two weeks.

942
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,180
What are you gonna tell
people to say?

943
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,180
"Surprise, Bradley.

944
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,300
"We know
you're getting divorced,

945
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,540
"but we wanted to celebrate

946
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,220
the milestone
that you didn't reach anyway"?

947
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,220
- They'll work it out!

948
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,500
- You should seriously
consider therapy.

949
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,900
- I've tried group therapy.

950
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,940
I've even tried that vvhack job
of a therapist

951
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,660
who told them
not to communicate.

952
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,140
- The Brush with Death.

953
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,100
I heard it's very successful
in the long run.

954
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,620
- But I don't have the long run.

955
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,580
I've got about a week
to fix this.

956
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,580
- You have to fix it, Ava?

957
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,100
- Who else?

958
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,660
- How about your parents?

959
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,420
- Well, they haven't exactly
been very effective

960
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,700
left to their own devices.

961
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,980
- And how has their separation

962
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,940
impacted your relationship
with Charlie?

963
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,100
- Who?
- Your husband.

964
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,220
- Oh, no.
Charlie.

965
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,660
He's fine.
He's great.

966
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,820
Well, actually, I just found out
he deliberately hid from me

967
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,580
the fact that he'd
been married before.

968
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,180
- So discovering
in quick succession

969
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,620
that both your father and your
husband were keeping secrets

970
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,100
doesn't have any great
significance for you?

971
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,580
- Okay.

972
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,060
I know where you're going
with this,

973
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,180
but can we just stick
to the issue at hand?

974
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,740
- Then your husband's previous
marriage is not an issue?

975
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,860
- Not presently.
No.

976
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,340
Can we get back to my parents?

977
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,660
- Did you consider
the possibility

978
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,340
that divorce could actually be
the best thing for your parents?

979
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,660
Seriously, though,
what do I do?

980
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,900
- Let go.

981
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,740
Let them work it out
for themselves.

982
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,180
By the way, do you lock
your filing cabinets?

983
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,660
You hooked up the dryer.

984
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,220
- Bradley did it.

985
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,780
-Oh.

986
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,660
- Not that I don't appreciate
all the help,

987
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,380
but sharing a house
with your dad

988
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,060
isn't exactly how I envisioned
married life.

989
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,620
- This has been hard on me too,
Charlie.

990
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,220
- Well, I miss my wife.

991
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,500
-Oh.
Hi.

992
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,220
This a bad time?

993
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,380
- Hi, Dad.
- Bradley.

994
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,620
- Thanks for hooking up
the dryer.

995
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,740
- Oh, it feels good to be handy,
you know.

996
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,100
I know Chuck's busy.

997
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,820
- I would have gotten to it
eventually.

998
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,940
- Yeah, right after you finish

999
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,420
putting up the shelves
in our bedroom?

1000
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,660
- Excuse me.

1001
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,340
I'm gonna take a shower.

1002
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,860
- Did you talk to your mom?

1003
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,740
I mean, did you tell her
how sorry I am

1004
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,420
about the ass thing?

1005
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,700
- Um, I didn't get a chance,
actually.

1006
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,580
She seems to have made
some travel plans.

1007
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,140
- Yeah, but your mother
hates to travel.

1008
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,260
- Actually, it's always been
a dream of hers.

1009
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,660
- She never mentioned anything.

1010
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,340
- Did you ask?

1011
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,580
Did you ever ask what she wanted
or if she was happy?

1012
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,940
- She never complained.

1013
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,500
I just assumed
that everything was fine.

1014
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,380
- I don't think this is just
about the affair, Dad.

1015
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,300
Do you?

1016
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,980
- So where's she going?

1017
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,340
- Thailand.

1018
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,260
- When?
- In ten days.

1019
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,300
-Oh, no.

1020
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,420
She's gonna miss
our anniversary.

1021
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,060
How long is she going for?

1022
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:33,100
- Um, she didn't say exactly,

1023
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,060
but she plans on making
a couple of other stops

1024
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,460
along the way.

1025
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,060
- How long, Ava?

1026
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,900
- Six months.

1027
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,620
- Six months.

1028
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,780
It's over.

1029
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,140
She's really left me for good.

1030
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,340
- Dad, you'll get her back.

1031
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,500
You just have to show her
how much you love her

1032
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,140
and remind her
how special she is to you.

1033
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,020
Can you please try
and cheer my dad up?

1034
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,020
Maybe take him out
for a drink or something?

1035
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,460
I need to stop my mom
from leaving.

1036
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,740
We'll get the two of them
together.

1037
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,980
We can talk it through.

1038
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,620
- That's a bad idea.

1039
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,860
Group therapy sure didn't work.

1040
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,740
I'm running out of options,
Charlie.

1041
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,060
Please help me.

1042
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,460
You owe me for making me
wife number two.

1043
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,500
- Fine.

1044
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,700
I'll help you out one last time,

1045
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,980
but you got to agree

1046
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,860
to never mention that stupid
Vegas wedding again.

1047
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,020
- Deal.

1048
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,420
- Here we go, gentlemen.

1049
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,300
- Hey.

1050
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,780
Oh, I can't drink this.

1051
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,940
- Oh, yeah, you can.

1052
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,060
I know the owner.
He's a big-time Jew.

1053
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,500
Only serves kosher.

1054
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,820
- Oh, thanks, Gerber.

1055
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,980
I didn't know
there were Irish Jews.

1056
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,420
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

1057
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,020
- So this is great.
A night out with the boys.

1058
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,260
- Yeah.

1059
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,660
I got to tell you,

1060
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,500
you got to leave the old ball
and chain at home sometimes.

1061
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,620
Although I can't complain.

1062
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,820
I love being married.

1063
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,860
I have never had this much sex
in my life.

1064
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,780
No, forget trolling bars
to get laid.

1065
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,460
Get married.
Hello.

1066
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,100
- You don't have sex
all the time.

1067
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,340
- Oh, yeah.
Whenever I want.

1068
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,660
Every which way.

1069
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,300
-I miss my wife.

1070
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,700
- Aw.

1071
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,700
- Look, Bradley, I'm sure
you guys will work it out,

1072
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,740
and if you don't...

1073
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,220
- Yeah, be a man.

1074
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,180
Bradley, there are plenty
of other chicks in the sea.

1075
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,380
Eastern Europe is teeming
with beautiful young women

1076
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,140
just dying to marry
a rich American.

1077
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,500
- Let's not get ahead
of ourselves here, Gerber.

1078
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,780
- 60 is the new 30.

1079
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,300
I saw you over
at the karaoke machine,

1080
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,100
ripping it up, going to work.

1081
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,100
Dude, Slavic hotties will be
all over your Johnson.

1082
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,660
Yeah, they will be lining up
for a man with your experience.

1083
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,900
- You think?

1084
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,180
- Absolutely.

1085
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,020
- Bet you find
a nice Jewish girl.

1086
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,300
Uh-oh.

1087
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:52,580
- Wouldn't Betty just love that?

1088
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,380
- Oh, I know the perfect place

1089
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,060
to celebrate your
newly anointed single status.

1090
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,500
- Where?
- Got any dollar bills on you?

1091
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,860
- Ah!
Let's have shots for everybody.

1092
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,460
- We are gonna put
some boobs on your face.

1093
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,860
Okay?

1094
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,420
- Okay, just this one time.
Yes.

1095
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,900
- Booby in your eye.

1096
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,420
- I know the separation's
hard on you, Ava,

1097
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,620
so I really appreciate
your show of support.

1098
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,940
I should be netting the web
in no time at all.

1099
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,260
- I just figured if you're gonna
be gone for six months,

1100
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:24,100
you need to be
internet and email savvy.

1101
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,980
Now we can keep in touch.

1102
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:29,980
- Well, I must admit,
I am a little nervous.

1103
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,260
- You are?

1104
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,060
- Well, it's been a long time
since I did anything

1105
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,540
this exciting or brave.

1106
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,660
I can't remember
the last time I did anything

1107
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,660
without your father.

1108
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,140
- Or you could do this with him.

1109
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,380
- Dad travel?

1110
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,300
He has a hard time
going to the mailbox.

1111
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,500
I just know he's devastated
without you.

1112
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,540
- Chase it!

1113
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,740
- Yeah!

1114
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,660
- Oh!
Who's next?

1115
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,300
- Oh, my God!

1116
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,020
- Here's Bradley!

1117
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,100
- Aren't you just a little sad
that your marriage is over?

1118
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,660
- Well, of course I am, Ava,

1119
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,660
but your father's incapable
of change or even compromise.

1120
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,700
And I refuse to be unfulfilled
any longer.

1121
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,900
- Why didn't you say anything
before?

1122
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,700
- I suppose I was
too busy worrying

1123
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,860
about everyone else's needs
to think about my own.

1124
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,020
Doesn't that sound like...

1125
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,500
What?

1126
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,940
- I'm all right.
I'm okay.

1127
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,660
No problem.

1128
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,420
Oh, you know, Charlie,

1129
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,260
you're my bestest,
favoritest son-in-law ever.

1130
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,420
- Really?

1131
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,780
'Cause you're, like,
my very favorite

1132
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,180
most father-in-law ever.

1133
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,540
- Oh, come on, give me a hug.

1134
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,020
- Bradley Gold.

1135
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,500
- Did you hear that?

1136
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,900
That sounded like my wife,
except I don't have one anymore.

1137
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,540
- Exactly what did you have
to drink tonight?

1138
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,420
- I don't know, but I'm sure
wasn't Manischewitz.

1139
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,420
- You should be ashamed
of yourself.

1140
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,700
- What?

1141
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,180
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

1142
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,260
- How was I supposed to know
your mom would be here?

1143
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,460
- I told you I was gonna try
to get the two of them together.

1144
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,660
This is your idea of helping?

1145
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,980
- You told me to cheer him up.

1146
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,060
Trust me,
tonight he was so happy.

1147
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,500
- Please tell me you did not
take my father Hot Chicks Live.

1148
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,260
- We didn't go
to Hot Chicks Live.

1149
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,380
Gerber's way too cheap
for Hot Chicks Live.

1150
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,780
- Gerber was with you?

1151
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,220
I hope you took a cab.

1152
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,980
- I guess chauffer duties were
in their marriage arrangements,

1153
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,140
'cause Gerber's wife
drove us home.

1154
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,460
And she's great,
and they're having sex...

1155
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,340
great Polish sex,
whatever that means...

1156
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,980
whenever he wants.

1157
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,940
- Show up at your daughter's
house this time of night,

1158
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,100
drunk as a skunk.

1159
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,540
I mean, what do you have
to say for yourself?

1160
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,820
- Thank you, Bradley,

1161
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,980
for validating a very difficult
life-altering decision

1162
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,100
l've just made.

1163
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,860
I now know
absolutely for certain

1164
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,180
that leaving you is the smartest
thing I've ever done.

1165
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,020
- Mom, you don't mean that.

1166
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,220
- Yeah.

1167
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,020
- Do you know that I dis-
I discovered tonight

1168
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,260
at this strip club?

1169
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,980
- No, please enlighten me.

1170
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,220
- I thought you said you didn't
take him to a strip club.

1171
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,460
- No, I said I didn't take him
to Hot Chicks Live.

1172
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,700
- I learned that there are women
in this world who want me.

1173
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,140
- Oh, they don't want you,
you idiot.

1174
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,460
They want your dollar bills.

1175
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,980
- You know,
there's a nation in Europe

1176
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,740
that has a lot
of pretty Russian Jews

1177
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,460
who want to have sex with me.

1178
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,460
- And time for bed.

1179
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,460
- Too bad that you don't have
the balls

1180
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,740
to fly out there and meet them.

1181
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,260
- Well, then I'll just have
to ship them in.

1182
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,140
- Mazel tov.

1183
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,180
- Oh!
I squished my fish.

1184
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,660
Oh, no.

1185
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,220
- Dude, did you say you were
gonna ship your balls?

1186
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,940
- Poor Malcolm.

1187
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,260
- This is what I'll be missing?

1188
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,100
- Mom, please.

1189
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,460
- Hey, Bradley, when I'm
cavorting naked on a Fiji beach

1190
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,940
with my Polynesian Adonis,

1191
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,500
I shall try to remember
to send you a postcard.

1192
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,020
-Oh...

1193
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,540
I think that went well.

1194
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,700
- "I" what?

1195
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,860
-I love you.

1196
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,380
- Do you realize
that what you did tonight

1197
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,820
brought my parents
closer than ever to divorce?

1198
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,420
- What I did?

1199
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,860
I was just trying
to cheer him up.

1200
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,100
I was helping you.

1201
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,820
But if you hadn't tried
to interfere tonight,

1202
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,780
none of this would have happened
in the first place.

1203
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,500
- Charlie, my parents
are getting divorced.

1204
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,860
I have real problems.

1205
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,060
- You know, maybe we should stop
focusing on your parents...

1206
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,500
Nice shelves.

1207
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,740
And start focusing on us.

1208
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,660
- Uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

1209
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,900
- Well, for one thing,

1210
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,420
It's been a little difficult
to have sex

1211
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,180
with your dad staying here.

1212
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,300
- Oh, I'm surprised you noticed.

1213
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,340
You've been so busy
texting with Adrianna.

1214
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,780
Work must be crazy.

1215
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,140
- You're the one
who's too distracted

1216
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,500
with everyone else's problems

1217
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,940
to even have sex
with your own husband.

1218
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,860
It's not been that long
since we've had sex,

1219
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,580
and I've been busy.

1220
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,580
- Well, you're not
doing anything right now.

1221
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,020
- Ugh, Charlie,

1222
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,060
if you think I'm gonna
sleep with you right now,

1223
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,380
you're even more drunk
than I thought.

1224
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,260
Oh!

1225
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,620
Is it really too much to ask

1226
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,460
to replace
the toilet paper roll?

1227
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,260
Is it really that difficult?

1228
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,580
What is it?

1229
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,820
A genetic predisposition
to measure your shits

1230
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,340
against the amount
of toilet paper left?

1231
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,260
Oh!

1232
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,900
And just so you know,

1233
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,980
I did not fall in love with you
again today.

1234
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,340
- Morning, beautiful.
I made your favorite.

1235
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,100
Black coffee, two sugars.

1236
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,700
Wheat toast with mayo.

1237
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,540
Truce?

1238
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,300
- Truce.

1239
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,380
I have to cancel
the surprise party.

1240
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,260
- You can't save
every marriage, Ava.

1241
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,740
- I feel like such a failure.

1242
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,100
- Promise me
you're done intervening.

1243
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,540
- I have no other choice.

1244
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,620
- Promise?

1245
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,220
Meet me tonight for dinner?

1246
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,980
- Mm-hmm.

1247
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,900
I can tell that some
positive changes

1248
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,620
have taken place
since our last session.

1249
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,420
What's going on?

1250
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,460
- When we left here, I began
to make that list you suggested.

1251
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,060
I dug really deep,

1252
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,820
and I realized the main reason
I was attracted to Courtney

1253
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,500
was because her family was rich.

1254
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,940
- Perhaps you were looking
to Courtney

1255
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,140
to provide emotional security.

1256
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,180
- Well, mostly I just liked
the fact she drove a Porsche.

1257
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,700
- And l realized
what l liked about Lloyd

1258
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,220
was that he wasn't rich.

1259
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,740
I knew that if I married him,

1260
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,100
it would really piss off
my father.

1261
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,660
- Excuse me?

1262
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,460
- Once we were finally honest
with each other,

1263
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,460
it was like this huge relief.

1264
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,660
So we've decided
to get a divorce.

1265
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,220
- And we just wanted to come
here in person to thank you.

1266
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,180
- To thank me for what?

1267
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,460
- If it wasn't for you,

1268
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,540
we could be stuck
in a lousy marriage for years

1269
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,740
without knowing any better.

1270
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,780
- Please, don't mention it.

1271
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,500
- Oh, I just got four winks
on Match.com.

1272
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,540
- I already got a date.

1273
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,580
-I need the guest list
for the party.

1274
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,620
I have to cancel it before
I meet Charlie for dinner.

1275
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:32,100
- You've seen the light.

1276
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,660
I am taking Mom speed dating
tonight,

1277
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,100
show her what the single life
is really like.

1278
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,740
- Genius.

1279
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,100
-I have my moments.

1280
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,340
- Hey.

1281
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,380
- Hi, John.

1282
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,940
- Do you guys
have an appointment?

1283
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,900
- No, things didn't really
work out with Amy and me.

1284
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,140
-Oh.

1285
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,380
So you're here to talk about it?

1286
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,700
- No, actually, I was wondering

1287
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:57,300
if Shelby was available
for dinner this evening.

1288
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,740
- Mm. No.

1289
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,700
I saw your test scores.

1290
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,180
- Cares more about your marriage
than you do.

1291
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,140
That's why you got to talk
to your woman

1292
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,820
and find out
what's the trouble.

1293
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,860
- Amen, brother.

1294
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,900
Amen.

1295
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,220
- Rough day?

1296
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,140
- Rough week.

1297
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,940
- Why'd you have an affair, Dad?

1298
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,340
- You know,
that was a long time ago.

1299
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,660
I never would have done it

1300
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:46,060
if I thought your mother and I
were gonna be reconciled.

1301
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,340
But...
I'm miserable, Ava.

1302
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:53,540
I can't sleep.
I can't eat.

1303
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,140
I just want her back.

1304
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,220
- Don't worry, Dad.

1305
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,180
We'll get her back.

1306
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,900
You and me together,
we'll do whatever it takes.

1307
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,620
Why don't you go
get an early night?

1308
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:12,580
- I just haven't been able
to sleep since she left.

1309
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:17,140
My mind keeps me awake,
keeps racing.

1310
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,300
- Charlie has sleeping pills.

1311
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,060
- You think that's safe?

1312
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,300
- Of course.
I'll go grab them.

1313
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,380
- Well, how many do I take?

1314
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,620
- Two, and you'll sleep
like a baby.

1315
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,340
No!
I said two, Dad.

1316
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,820
- From what I remember
about babies,

1317
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,020
they wake up a lot.

1318
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,540
Good night, pumpkin.

1319
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,340
- I'm not sure about this
speed dating thing, Shelby.

1320
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,500
- Oh, you'll love it.

1321
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,660
You can squeeze in 50 bad dates

1322
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:13,180
and only sacrifice one night.

1323
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,500
- Oh!

1324
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,060
Well, welcome, all.

1325
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,620
Now, you'll have five minutes
to speak with your date.

1326
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,020
When I hit that buzzer,

1327
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,660
the man must move on
to the next woman.

1328
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,820
Under 35s to my right.

1329
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,980
Over 35s to my left.

1330
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:33,180
Ladies, please,
take your seats.

1331
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,460
- Come on, Mom.
Let's go.

1332
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,660
- 911.
Is this an emergency?

1333
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,460
- Hi, I think my dad
overdosed on sleeping pills,

1334
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,300
and I need an ambulance
right away.

1335
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,180
- A marriage is forever.

1336
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,580
Fidelity is essential.

1337
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,620
A shame my ex-wife
didn't agree.

1338
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,060
Yeah, she left me.

1339
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,020
-Oh.

1340
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,380
- At least she thinks she did.

1341
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,580
- Men, y'all better move.

1342
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,500
- I think you're in
the wrong section.

1343
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,660
The under 35s are over there.

1344
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,140
- A cougar's calling.

1345
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,340
Rawr!

1346
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,860
- Child, didn't you hear
that buzzer?

1347
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,460
Time to switch.
Get over here.

1348
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,020
- I really like squirrels.
You like squirrels?

1349
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,380
- I think I heard the buzzer.

1350
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:12,420
- I'm so nervous.
I hate these things.

1351
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:18,860
- Hmm.

1352
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,180
- Ava!
Ava!

1353
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,820
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1354
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,860
- Bradley.
What happened?

1355
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,340
- How many sleeping pills
did he take?

1356
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,420
- Uh, I don't know,

1357
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,300
but the bottle was empty
when I found it.

1358
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,540
- My bottle of sleeping pills?

1359
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,740
That was practically full.

1360
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,420
- One of you can ride with us.

1361
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,260
- I'll follow in my car, okay?
- Okay.

1362
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,140
- So do you want to go home
and slit our wrists now

1363
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,220
or get drunk first?

1364
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,780
- Hi, Ava.

1365
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,780
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1366
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,540
Oh, we're coming.
We're coming.

1367
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,980
- I never should have left
my pills out.

1368
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,820
I just didn't see this coming.
Did you?

1369
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:10,620
- Me?
No.

1370
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,220
- Where is he?
Where is he?

1371
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,780
Is he all right?

1372
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,780
- It's okay.

1373
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,100
Doctors are in with him
right now.

1374
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,900
- It's all my fault.
I'm a horrible wife.

1375
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,780
- I can't believe he actually
tried to kill himself.

1376
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,700
- Shelby.
Not now.

1377
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,180
- He's recovering nicely.

1378
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,780
- Oh, thank God for that.
Can I see him?

1379
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,820
- Of course. Go in.
Nurse, show her in, please.

1380
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,780
I have to tell you, though,

1381
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,100
we did find
some very small traces

1382
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,380
of the drug in his system.

1383
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,620
In my opinion, this was not
a suicide attempt.

1384
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,780
- Oh, that's a huge relief,
Doctor.

1385
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,860
Thank you so much for your help.
Thank you.

1386
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,180
- You're welcome.

1387
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,940
We'll keep him here overnight
just to make sure,

1388
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,620
but he should be fine to leave
in the morning.

1389
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,580
- Okay.
- All right.

1390
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,660
- It's just so strange.

1391
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,300
You said the bottle
was empty, right?

1392
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,260
- Yeah, I think.

1393
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,060
- Either it was empty or not.

1394
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,820
- Mm.
It's not that simple.

1395
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,820
- What's not that simple?

1396
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:06,020
It was empty, or why else
would you call 911?

1397
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,700
- As a precaution.

1398
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,380
- Ava, what are you
talking about?

1399
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,140
- I've always wanted to try
the food here.

1400
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,980
I hear their Jell-O
is fabulous.

1401
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,500
-I may have
slightly exaggerated

1402
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:17,860
the number of pills
that he took.

1403
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,460
- Exaggerated?

1404
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,780
- I'm gonna go find
the cafeteria

1405
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,940
and that hot doctor.

1406
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:28,380
- Oh, you're not
gonna like this.

1407
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,500
Um...

1408
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,380
I knew my dad didn't take
the whole bottle,

1409
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,060
but he was having
a lot of trouble sleeping,

1410
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,140
so he took three
to help him fall asleep.

1411
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,260
- And the rest of them?

1412
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,020
- I flushed them
down the toilet.

1413
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,020
- You did what?

1414
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,540
-I know.
I'm not proud.

1415
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,500
- Jesus, Ava.
What the hell is wrong with you?

1416
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,500
- I was desperate, okay?

1417
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,500
My dad has been just devastated
since the separation,

1418
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,180
and I needed to do something
to bring them together.

1419
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,860
- You promised me
you were done interfering.

1420
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,500
What you did was illegal.

1421
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,380
If anyone found out,
you could lose your license.

1422
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:58,820
You could even go to prison.

1423
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,820
- Charlie, you're making it
sound way worse than it is.

1424
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,500
- No, Ava,
I'm telling you how it is.

1425
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:04,260
- Their 30th anniversary
is coming up...

1426
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,940
- I can't believe this.

1427
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,740
- Why are you walking away
from me?

1428
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,580
- How dare you think you can
just manipulate people

1429
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:10,860
to get your way?

1430
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,020
- I'm sorry, but I did it
for my parents.

1431
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,660
- No, you didn't do it for them

1432
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,740
You did it for yourself.

1433
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,980
- I was only trying to help.

1434
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,260
Charlie, where are you going?

1435
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,140
- I can't believe
this is who you are!

1436
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,820
- I'm dead, aren't I?

1437
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,780
- No.
Very much alive.

1438
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,300
- Are you sure?

1439
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,020
Because for me,

1440
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:54,460
heaven is where you are, Betty.

1441
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,380
I love you so much.

1442
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,700
And I'll do
whatever you want me to do.

1443
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,700
I'll get on a plane
to Thailand.

1444
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:06,980
I'll pick up a tapeworm
in India.

1445
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,460
I'll even come clean
with the girls about Ian.

1446
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,300
But I want you to be happy,
Betty,

1447
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:18,180
and I want to be part
of that happiness.

1448
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,900
- When I got that phone call
tonight,

1449
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:24,100
I realized that you're not
a part of that happiness.

1450
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:27,620
-Oh.

1451
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:34,340
- You are that happiness to me.

1452
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,020
Mm.

1453
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:52,500
Mm.

1454
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,060
- Mom's gonna spend the night.

1455
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,540
You need a ride?

1456
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,700
If it's any consolation,

1457
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,580
I thought it was
an inspired idea.

1458
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,860
- Thanks.

1459
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,740
I'll remember that when I get
the divorce papers.

1460
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,660
- No, I'm serious.
That took major balls.

1461
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,260
I have a newfound respect
for you.

1462
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,300
- Somehow that makes me
feel worse.

1463
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,420
- Excuse me.
What room is Bradley Gold in?

1464
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,540
- Just a second.

1465
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,260
- isn't that
the deli delivery guy?

1466
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,260
- Yeah, his wife, Betty,
called me.

1467
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,900
I'm his son.

1468
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,780
- It's room 412.

1469
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,740
- 412.
Thank you.

1470
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,100
- How old are you?

1471
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,780
- 25.
- Me too.

1472
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,060
When's your birthday?

1473
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,940
- May.

1474
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,940
- I'm June.

1475
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,780
- Busy month.

1476
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,180
- Is there a July?

1477
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,420
- How long have you known?

1478
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,500
- Ian came to me
right after your wedding.

1479
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,900
- How come you didn't
say anything before?

1480
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:20,780
- Oh, I was shocked.

1481
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:24,300
- In our dad's defense,

1482
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,140
he didn't know about me.

1483
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:28,820
My mom kept his identity secret.

1484
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:31,420
I mean, I only found out,

1485
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:35,940
well, after she died
a few months ago.

1486
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,860
- That sucks.

1487
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,780
- Yeah, yeah, it really does.

1488
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,060
- Sorry.

1489
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:45,220
So when were you planning
on telling us?

1490
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,820
- He was working up to it.

1491
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:49,700
- I realize that I have
some apologizing to do,

1492
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:56,020
and, Ian, I know that I
missed out on, well, everything.

1493
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,700
But I'd like to make it up
to you if you'd let me.

1494
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,380
- And all this time,
I thought I was an only child.

1495
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,220
- You might still wish you were.

1496
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,700
- Oh, thank you.

1497
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:46,660
- Hi.

1498
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,740
It's your wife.
Remember me?

1499
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:51,300
- I'm not sure who you are.

1500
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,140
I know you're angry,

1501
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,460
but you didn't tell me about
your whole Vegas wedding,

1502
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:00,700
and I still forgave you.

1503
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,060
So maybe this is my
total screw-up moment

1504
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,860
you just have to forgive me for.

1505
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:10,820
You planning on coming home
anytime soon?

1506
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:12,420
- I can't answer that
right now.

1507
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,700
- You can't just ignore
our marriage, Charlie.

1508
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:15,980
- The way you have?

1509
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:18,300
- I'm a therapist.
Helping people is what I do.

1510
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,860
But this was personal.

1511
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,100
My parents were separating.

1512
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,540
- Yeah.

1513
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:32,580
The anniversary party's on
for tomorrovv afternoon.

1514
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,260
Will you be my date?

1515
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:37,940
- I'm not really in the mood
to celebrate.

1516
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,940
- Is there something else
going on?

1517
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:42,420
I mean, you and Adrianna
seem awfully close.

1518
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,260
- If that's the person
who you think you married,

1519
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,540
then what are you
even doing here?

1520
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:46,660
- Aren't we worth fighting for?

1521
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,460
- What are you fighting for?

1522
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,540
Your marriage or me?

1523
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:51,540
- It's the same thing.

1524
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,180
- No.
No, it's not.

1525
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:56,660
You want a husband so when your
patients ask if you're married,

1526
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,660
you can tell them yes.

1527
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,420
And that way, it'll validate
all the advice you give them.

1528
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:05,220
I feel like the worst thing
we did to our relationship

1529
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:06,580
was get married.

1530
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,340
- Sorry to interrupt you guys.

1531
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:12,020
Charlie,
it's your conference call

1532
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:13,420
to discuss the new Chardonnay.

1533
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:14,660
They're on line two.

1534
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,820
- Thanks.

1535
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,140
I have to get this.

1536
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,940
- Got any tequila over there?

1537
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,300
- What, you want a shot?

1538
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,340
- Just hand me the whole bottle.

1539
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,220
- You know why I think Charlie
gave you the wine

1540
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:23,220
for a wedding gift?

1541
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,340
- ls this really relevant, Dad?

1542
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:28,580
- Could be.

1543
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:31,260
He told me once that
when the grapes are growing,

1544
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:34,620
the winemakers
purposely stress them out

1545
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,220
by depriving them of water

1546
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:40,780
and giving them
an overabundance of sunshine.

1547
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,420
Now, this weeds out
the weak ones,

1548
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:47,020
and only the strongest
and best survive,

1549
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:51,820
and those are the grapes
that make the finest wine.

1550
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,820
Now, the greatest love

1551
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:56,860
survives the harshest
of conditions.

1552
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:00,500
And surviving that turmoil

1553
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:03,700
is what makes a marriage strong.

1554
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,460
- Thanks, Dad.

1555
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:12,540
But I still want the tequila.

1556
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:27,140
- Dude, better get dressed.
Come on.

1557
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,060
Don't want to be late
and ruin the surprise.

1558
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,660
- I'm not going.

1559
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,660
I left the toilet seat up.

1560
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,900
It's a work in progress.

1561
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,060
- Tell me about it.

1562
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,980
- You know, buddy,

1563
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:49,380
you're always welcome here,

1564
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:52,220
but now long
are you planning to stay?

1565
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:55,460
It's just Kasha's parents
are coming to visit

1566
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,540
and her two brothers
and three cousins.

1567
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,180
- Are you all right with that?

1568
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,860
- Absolutely.

1569
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:03,780
When you get married, you don't
set limits on what love means.

1570
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,780
Okay, but that shit is weird,

1571
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,820
dude, with the bread
and the mayo.

1572
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:10,420
I bet you're the only person
on Earth

1573
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,500
that eats toast that way.

1574
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:22,220
- Dad, are you sure
you can drink that?

1575
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,460
I don't think it's kosher.

1576
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,380
- Well, I'm taking
a more relaxed approach

1577
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,580
to things these days.

1578
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:28,860
Besides, we're celebrating.

1579
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,940
Your mother and I just booked
a trip to Thailand.

1580
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:32,300
- Wow.

1581
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,020
- Exotic trips,
exotic cuisine...

1582
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,620
how will you survive?

1583
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,180
- Turns.

1584
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:39,620
- Ian's gonna housesit for us.

1585
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,500
- What?
How come he gets to?

1586
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,940
- Because he's older,
sweetheart.

1587
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,340
- By a month.

1588
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,580
- Sibling rivalry.
Started already.

1589
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:47,980
- Don't worry about it, Shel.

1590
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,860
I'll invite you
to all the wild parties.

1591
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,780
And you won't even
be responsible for the cleanup.

1592
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:54,340
- Brother, where have you been
all my life?

1593
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,620
Come with me.

1594
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,900
I'll show you where Dad
hides the good booze.

1595
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:00,260
- Is Charlie meeting us
at the winery?

1596
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:03,460
- It was nice of him to
invite us to the wine tasting.

1597
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,060
- It's not you guys
he's upset with.

1598
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,580
- Well, best get going.

1599
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,580
- Betty.
- Yes?

1600
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:13,460
Oh, thank you, darling.

1601
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,580
I'm just gonna run upstairs
and update my Facebook status.

1602
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,060
- I hate to see you go,

1603
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,940
but I love to watch you leave.

1604
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,100
- Bradley, did you take
your antacid?

1605
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,380
- No.

1606
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,140
- You know how white wine
affects your stomach.

1607
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,620
You won't be able to sleep.

1608
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,460
- With any luck...

1609
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:43,700
Surprise!

1610
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,980
- Are you two
responsible for this?

1611
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,540
- You two should be grounded
for lying to us.

1612
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:53,820
- Are we really grounded?

1613
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:56,060
- She's not my mom.

1614
01:12:56,060 --> 01:13:00,580
- Well, I don't believe it.

1615
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:04,340
- Well, I just want to thank
you all for being here today.

1616
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,780
30 years is no mean feat,

1617
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,020
and I'd be lying to you

1618
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:11,100
if I told you that we hadn't had
a few bumps along the road.

1619
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,780
- Or mountains.

1620
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:16,580
- But I just want to tell you
how lucky I feel

1621
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:19,540
to have this woman by my side

1622
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,980
and how I love her even more

1623
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:25,300
for sticking with me
during those trying times

1624
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:28,180
when even I might have left me.

1625
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:31,980
So I just want
to propose a toast

1626
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:35,260
to the love of my life,

1627
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:38,980
to Betty.

1628
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:42,340
- Betty.
- Betty.

1629
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,940
- Betty.

1630
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:47,180
- L'chaim.

1631
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,740
- This will help.

1632
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,020
Charlie running late?

1633
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:16,500
- I don't think
he's gonna make it.

1634
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,100
- Will you two?

1635
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:22,300
- I don't know.

1636
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,260
I don't know what happened.

1637
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:28,540
- Yeah, I mean, you ignored him

1638
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:29,860
by prioritizing your parents,

1639
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,380
sex-starved him,

1640
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:33,060
and then you went
psycho criminal on his ass.

1641
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,020
I can see
where it gets confusing.

1642
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,540
I did try apologizing.

1643
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,740
- Trying to get him to come

1644
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,180
to your parents'
anniversary party

1645
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:43,780
so you don't lose face
in front of the family

1646
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:46,260
is a lot like apologizing.

1647
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:50,060
- When did you get so smart?

1648
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:51,220
- Is Ava Dalton admitting

1649
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,820
that she doesn't know
everything?

1650
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,820
- Yes, yes.
Okay, I admit it.

1651
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:58,620
I'm not perfect,
and I don't know everything.

1652
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:03,300
- Well, I've known that
for about 25 years.

1653
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:05,260
I think there might be
someone else

1654
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,700
you need to mention it to.

1655
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:16,540
- Oh, say good night
to Mom and Dad for me.

1656
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:22,420
- I should open
my own practice.

1657
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,980
- There you are, darling.
I've been looking for you.

1658
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:29,580
This is Jeremiah,
Rabbi Stevens' son.

1659
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:31,420
And this is my daughter Shelby.

1660
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:33,780
- Hi, Jeremiah,
Rabbi Stevens' son.

1661
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,300
- Nice to meet you.

1662
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:37,380
- Have a seat.

1663
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,820
- Thank you.

1664
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:42,300
- I think you may find you have
quite a few things in common.

1665
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:45,220
- So you're Jewish.

1666
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:52,060
Wait a minute.
My dad told me about you.

1667
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,780
Aren't you
the wandering degenerate?

1668
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,060
- And aren't you
the sponging sister?

1669
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:59,780
- It's "slutty sponging sister,"
if you don't mind.

1670
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:02,740
- No, actually,

1671
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:05,500
I don't mind at all.

1672
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,260
- I'm so sorry, Charlie.

1673
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:51,300
- Before you start apologizing,

1674
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,900
I have some things to say.

1675
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,300
Okay?

1676
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,780
About eight weeks ago,

1677
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,420
you promised to love me

1678
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:01,060
in sickness, in health,
and all that other stuff.

1679
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:03,420
Remember?

1680
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:07,140
Well, I have some amendments
to those vows.

1681
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:10,380
Do you promise to fall in love
with me every day,

1682
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:11,380
even when we fight?

1683
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:13,020
- Yes.

1684
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,340
- Will you swear
to have sex with me

1685
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,780
at least twice a week,

1686
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,820
sometimes twice a day
when the mood strikes?

1687
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:19,660
- Oh, yes.

1688
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,460
- And finally,

1689
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,380
do you accept the fact
that I'll probably never, ever

1690
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,660
in the next 50 years

1691
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,580
remember to put a new
toilet roll on the dispenser?

1692
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,460
I do.

1693
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:36,020
- Let's go back.

1694
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,220
Let's show these people

1695
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:38,780
that we know how to make
a marriage work.

1696
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:39,860
- No.

1697
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,260
- No?

1698
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,780
- A marriage isn't official

1699
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:45,060
until it's been consummated.

1700
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,300
-I knew there was a reason
why I married you.

1701
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:19,460
Who's the most beautiful baby
in the whole wide world?

1702
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,460
- Look at Mommy.

1703
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:50,500
- Oh, and just so you know...

1704
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:54,300
Ah!

1705
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:57,220
- I'm a big boy.

1706
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:59,180
Didn't use to be.

1707
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:02,260
- Focus.

1708
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:06,740
And action.

1709
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,220
- Are you wearing a yarmulke?

1710
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,300
- Yeah, you like it?

1711
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:24,900
I had to dig around
in the basement to find it.

1712
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,620
I haven't worn one
since I was a kid.

1713
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:28,980
- Nice.
Very... Jewish.

1714
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:31,820
- Well, that's the look
I was going for.

1715
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:36,740
- Physical contact
make you uncomfortable?

1716
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:39,460
- No, I just don't hug
strangers,

1717
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:42,340
most particularly,
men I don't know.

1718
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:44,060
- He's more comfortable
sleeping with women

1719
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:45,460
he's just met.

1720
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,340
- It's "slutty sponging sister,"
if you don't mind.

1721
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:52,860
- No, actually,
I don't mind at all.

1722
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:55,900
Sorry.

1723
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:57,020
- Ah right, out.

1724
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:57,980
- Did we get it?

1725
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,860
- What the hell?
Oop.
