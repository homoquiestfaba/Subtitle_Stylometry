1 
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,513 
It's her smile I miss the most. 

2 
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,951 
It's my own fault things 
headed this way, really

3 
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:14,851 
Why? 

4 
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:23,529 
Most people have no idea 
what kinds of things, monsters really exist. 

5 
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:25,959 
It creeps me out. 

6 
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:31,600 
Evil is out there and I'm gonna find it
and I'll put it where it belongs 
even if I have to do it alone. 

7 
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,600  


8 
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,745 
The Devil's gonna pay. 

9 
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,910 
I know what I'm doing. 

10 
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,708 
I think. 

11 
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,605 
Oh! 

12 
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:13,607 
These terrorists actually think
they are gonne get away with it. 

13 
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,651 
We all know that evil doesn't really exist. 

14 
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:21,723 
Allah Akbar. 

15 
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,758  
- It's him, it's him!
- Come, boys look! 

16 
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:25,755 


17 
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:35,432 
I have just received a revelation from 
Allah, the most merciful. 

18 
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,400 
No more warnings. 

19 
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,408 
These pigs and dogs 
ignore them anyway 

20 
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:47,474 
And they are unworthy of
escaping Allah's mighty wrath.. 

21 
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:53,349 
Prepare therefore to enter paradise.

22 
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,352 
- Allah Akbar. 
- Praise be to Allah. 

23 
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,657 
- Allah Akbar. 
- Allah Akbar. 

24 
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,392 
Tell my mother not to weep ... 

25 
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,498 
for I will be in paradise. 

26 
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,302 
Turn your sorrow into anger. 

27 
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,543 
For I got to give my life in Jihad. 
By Allah. 

28 
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,708 
- Only use it once. Don't forget. 
- Don't worry about me man. 

29 
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,714 
If we have any reason to worry.

30 
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,618 
If ever betray our trust...

31 
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,921 
I don't have to tell you what
we're gonna do to you, huh?

32 
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,550 
Yo man, I passed all your tests
so far ain't I?

33 
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,854 
I'm good bro. 

34 
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,728 
Pass this last test you'll
get everything you want

35 
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,883 
All we've got is a face. 

36 
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,792 
That's the best we can do. 

37 
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,766 
It's just the tip of an iceberg. 
He's working with someone new. 

38 
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,235 
Someone of major concern. 

39 
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,274 
Your mission is to track him down
and take him out 

40 
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,975 
and everyone who's working with him

41 
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,740 
As usual, no evidence, no witnesses.

42 
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,478 
<i> Find out what you can and then 
kill them all. </ i> 

43 
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,718 
If you fail in any way, 
we will deny any involvement, 

44 
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,277 
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. 

45 
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,918 
I just want to know that you're 
the only one we can count on to
get the job done right.

46 
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,891 


47 
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,459 
Just you. 

48 
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,466 
Where is it? 

49 
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,924 
Great Satan! 

50 
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,322 
Doing your mother proud my man. 

51 
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,631 
Balls of steal, thanks for the message.

52 
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,335 
I'm gonna get 'em this time. 

53 
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,999 
What is the scene up there anyway? 

54 
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,865 
- You don't wanna go up there man. 
 

55 
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,649 
Bite me! 

56 
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,784 
- In your dreams scumbag. 
- I know what you are. 

57 
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,516 
Your dead powers belong to us! 

58 
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,921 
Your breath is already wicked enough. 
You're making me dizzy. 

59 
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,390 
Now, shut up! 

60 
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,327 
Rinse! 

61 
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,511 
Here's your problem. 

62 
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,555 
That's a little better. 

63 
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,022 
Now ... 

64 
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,526 
you must give me bite! 

65 
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,529 
For the glory of Allah, bite me! 

66 
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,529 
OK! suit yourself. 
You ready? 

67 
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,709 
Bloodbath. 

68 
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,281 
Oh, yeah. 

69 
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,344 
You again. 

70 
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,405 
Well, it looks like you
caught me red-handed this time. 

71 
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,583 
Don't move. 

72 
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:55,648 
Don't move! 

73 
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,454 
Do you mind? 
These guys bleed too much. 

74 
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,722 
<i> I'm serious. </ i> 

75 
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,350 
This is the last time. 

76 
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,851 
Okay <i>-</ i> 

77 
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,628 
- What is that? 
- Silver. 

78 
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,629 
Ouch! 
Isn't that for werewolves? 

79 
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:16,899 
That stings. 

80 
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,534 
Never been shot by a
silver bullet before. 

81 
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:19,970 
I got a clip full of them. 

82 
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,440 
Yeah? If you shoot me again, 
you're really gonna piss me off. 

83 
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,841 
That's it. 

84 
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,743 
Let me guess. 
Holy water? 

85 
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,439 
Please. You'll get more reaction 
from sewer water. 

86 
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,921 
Come on, get up. 

87 
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,956 
Is that all you got for me tonight?

88 
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:15,955 
Weak. 

89 
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,837 
Looks like you've been doing 
your homework, 

90 
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,672 
but you're reading the wrong books. 

91 
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:26,875 
Hey, look. 

92 
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,737 
Improvise. 

93 
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,506 
Grab the knives and throw them at me

94 
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,316 
Nice shot. 

95 
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,332 
Not the face! 

96 
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,972 
My turn. 

97 
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,386 
You know what happens when you kill a cop? 


98 
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,058 
I'm gonna kill a couple more? 

99 
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,259 
I wanna kill you so bad. 

100 
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,431 
I was just gonna say 
the same thing to you. 

101 
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,198 
So what's your excuse, huh? 

102 
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,736 
- I ain't the one who is immortal here. 
- I'm healing. 

103 
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,269 
Just wait. 

104 
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,171 
Yeah, well, I'm just resting so, 
if you wanna go get it ... 

105 
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,115 
Now you're just getting lucky. 

106 
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,113 
- You are persistent though. 
- I'm coming after you no matter what. 

107 
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,317 
You're out there killing people 
all the time that's just ... 

108 
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,416 
That's just messed up. 

109 
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,823 
I'm a hit man what do you expect
me to do, get a day job?

110 
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,360 
Besides these guys are all pigshit anyway.

111 
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,791 
I'm just cleaning it up
before you step in it 

112 
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,127 
- I'm doing you a favor. 
- Well here. 

113 
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,132 
Drive this stake in your heart and 
do me another one. 

114 
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,968 
Sorry pal, you're just 
gonna have to keep trying. 

115 
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,612 
Tell me, besides trying to kill me, 

116 
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,815 
- Why are you so by the book? 
- Innocent until proven guilty. 

117 
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,348 
I should be arresting these guys 
not letting you kill them. 

118 
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,717 
What about me? 

119 
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,618 
- You've never seen me kill anyone. 
- You're guilty. 

120 
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,659 
Look at yourself. Look at what you are 
you're not even human. 

121 
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,565 
You deserve to burn in hell. 

122 
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:39,932 
That may be true. 

123 
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,402 
But if you'll only knew what these filthy 
cockroaches were planning on doing ... 

124 
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,236 
- The system can handle guys like this. 
- Your system is a game. 

125 
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,002 
These guys are guilty. 
Trust me on that one. 

126 
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,413 
My solution was just a whole lot 
faster and cheaper then yours. 

127 
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,017 
And it's still justice. 

128 
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,214 
Who gives you the right to be 
judge and jury, huh? 

129 
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,213 
You can't possibly know everything. 

130 
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,056 
I'll tell you what I do know. 

131 
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,559 
Terrorists are invading the city. 
They're about to do something big. 

132 
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,092 
- I may be evil but they're way worse. 
- Then I'll arrest them. 

133 
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,593 
No you won't. 

134 
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,232 
Gotta go. 

135 
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,772 
By the way ... 
in 10 seconds get out of here. 

136 
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,674 
The building's gonna blow. 

137 
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,648 
Did I forget to mention that? 

138 
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,078 
What can you tell us about 
what happened here today? 

139 
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:03,180 
Well, you see this building here... 
it just blew up

140 
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,113 
It's on fire now. 

141 
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,919 
It's probably very hot. 

142 
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,263 
Did you hear the thunder last night? 
Crazy! 

143 
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,503 
Ho, ho, ho, man. 
Hold another all-nighter, huh? 

144 
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,298 
Just doing my job 

145 
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:26,834 
Your job? 
What the hell is this? 

146 
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,377 
As I was telling him, my job. 

147 
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,913 
I got the feds, CIA, NSA, 

148 
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,684 
and the department of homeland security 
all over my ass all because of you. 

149 
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:37,953 
You know ... 

150 
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,556 
I like my coffee like 
I like my women. 

151 
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:42,024 
Don't you dare say it! 

152 
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,018 
In my office now! 

153 
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,522 
Brown and bitter. 

154 
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,594 
I want an explanation. 

155 
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,938 
Tell me what you've left out the report. 

156 
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,007 
Everything I know is in there. 

157 
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,546 
- I promise. 
- Really? 

158 
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,280 
Single suspect, none forced entry. 

159 
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,575 
Out of hundreds of shots fired, 
not one drop of his blood was found. 

160 
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,881 
Nor was there so much a trace 
of evidence he was even there. 

161 
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,290 
I doubt this man even exists. 

162 
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,519 
I don't know what you want me to tell you. 
It's in the report. 

163 
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,455 

164 
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,129 
Mr. President, we caught one. 
He's getting us partial intel on a meeting 

165 
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,303 
between high-level terrorist 
gathering in Manyak Akbar village. 

166 
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,167 
The missing Sovjet weapons expert 
apparently, he's there too. 

167 
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,168 
Let me guess. 

168 
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,769 
He won't give us the time, this gathering 

169 
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,807 
untill I have to get to New York 
to see his lawyer. 

170 
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,482 
Permission to continue enhanced 
interrogation technique Sir? 

171 
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,013 
Damn right! 

172 
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,331 
Welcome my brother. 

173 
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,732 
I am Zubri. 

174 
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,544 
I trust your journey
was pleasant one? 

175 
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,815 
Please come with me. 
Let me show you to you quarters. 

176 
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,782 
You're going to love it. 

177 
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,452 
What's with the fetus? 

178 
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,464 
This is Marud. 
He's our explosives expert. 

179 
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,896 
- But ... 
- There is no one better. 

180 
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:37,104 
Please ... our servants will 
show you to your room. 

181 
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,582 
We will summon you for the meeting. 

182 
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,094 
Master! 

183 
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,931 
Master, they have returned! 
They have returned! 

184 
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,035 
They have returned! 

185 
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,735 
Brother, they are back! 

186 
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,710 
Where are the others? 

187 
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:57,253 
- I'm the only one left. 
- Yes, you've done well. 

188 
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:02,416 
I ... I have completed my quest. 

189 
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,493 
Indeed. Get him the man a drink. 

190 
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,560 
Please. 

191 
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:32,014 
Bring the chest to my chambers,
and prepare a toast! 

192 
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:41,457 
In celebration of our unity, 
we drink to Jihad. 

193 
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,498 
The life is in the blood. 

194 
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:53,566 
This is our Jihad bomb. 

195 
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,408 
It will blow up an entire city. 

196 
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,881 
All we need is nuclear material 
to be inserted here 

197 
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,057 
and for detonation device, 
which will go there. 

198 
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,160 
Now, a normal nuclear bomb 
would take out this area. 

199 
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:17,098 
And it will fall out... and spread here. 

200 
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,003 
But the new experimental material you 
will obtain will cause such immense damage. 

201 
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,830 
we can only calculate it. 

202 
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,438 
No one has ever seen the effects. 

203 
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,574 
But ... it should do this. 

204 
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,650 
What would we do without the Russians? 

205 
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,883 
Excuse me. 

206 
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:45,691 
But, where are we going to get 
such nuclear material? 

207 
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,697 
Leave that to me. 

208 
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:54,494 
What we worry about is getting us all
into enemy lands without being detected. 

209 
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,574 
We have researched all potential ways 
of infiltrating the United States. 

210 
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:02,743 
We have found the absolute safest, 
easiest way possible 

211 
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,710 
without the slightest
possibility of being caught. 

212 
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,384 
I have obtained student visas 
for all of us. 

213 
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,952 
Something called racial profiling 
and political correctness, 

214 
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,521 
which basically means there is not
a change we will be searched 

215 
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:21,595 
as long as we all look 
exactly like terrorists. 

216 
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,644 
I'll handle it. 

217 
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,512 
Everyone get out. 

218 
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,685 
But ... 

219 
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,711 
Get out! 

220 
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,859 
Yes sir. 

221 
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:29,063 
Find them ... 
wherever they are hiding. 

222 
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:33,427 
And, um ... 
I want him to redecorate. 

223 
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,568 
Absolutely. 

224 
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,940 
Any particular method? 

225 
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,438 
- Something with flair. 
- Done. 

226 
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,861 
Do the worst... 

227 
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,360 
whatever it takes. 
I don't want to know. 

228 
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,195 
No problem. Will do. 

229 
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,003 
Yes, thank you Mr. President. 

230 
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,339 
Security missed it. 

231 
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,003 
It showed up on our facial recognition 
system a few hours ago.. 

232 
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,013 
His name is ... 
Muhammad Akeem bin Fatah. 

233 
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,119 
Kalamhi Ahkbah Sallam Fatanm. 

234 
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:26,116 
Falla Abdulla Hasan Yassan Kwani. 

235 
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,157 
Ah, screw it. 
Let's just call him Bob. 

236 
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,388 
We don't exactly know 
what he is up to. 

237 
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,791 
He always seems to be 
two steps ahead of us. 

238 
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,294 
But he has taken out some of 
some of the world's top agents. 

239 
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,368 
What do you suspect? 

240 
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,039 
We can't even begin to imagine,
but whatever it is,

241 
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,037 
it'll be catastrophic. 

242 
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,238 
That's why we ned you to stop him. 

243 
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,304 
This is one of his latest atrocities. 

244 
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,615 
His men filtered with children
carrying explosives. 

245 
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,885 
This man is really pure evil. 
He's a reprobate. 

246 
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,154 
- He needs to be dead. 
- Leads? 

247 
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,157 
Get this he's just a narc.. 

248 
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:09,129 
He was in there looking for drug dealers 
and stumbles on to a terrorist cell. 

249 
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,625 
He's answering directly to the NSA now. 

250 
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,231 
He's in way over his head. 

251 
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,340 
- Is that cop still on your tail? 
- Not for long. 

252 
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:21,402 
- Do you want us to take care of it? 
- No. I'll handle it. 

253 
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,180 
You keep saying that. 
Why don't you just take him out? 

254 
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,842 
We have the authority. 

255 
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,181 
Take a look at this.
This is worse then we thought. 

256 
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,819 
They call him "The executioner". 

257 
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,819 
He loves decapitation. 

258 
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,893 
Chances are he is the man in the hood 
in most beheading videos out there. 

259 
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,734 
He's the most dangerous explosives man
in the world and probably the best. 

260 
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:45,900 
His name is Marud. 

261 
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,098 
Don't let his size fool you

262 
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,297 
Ali, he loves chemical biological weaponry. 

263 
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,934 
He invents new drugs for the enemy. 

264 
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,972 
One more rear way for Jihad. 

265 
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,115 
According to our informative, key players 
have moved to an undisclosed location 

266 
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,645 
We can't just let that lie. 

267 
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,576 
We've got to take on that warehouse. 

268 
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,448 
 

269 
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,021 
Run those cockroaches out 
and see what happens. 

270 
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,726 
Now ... if you want to start 
digging for Bob ... 

271 
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,856 
Errand boy, 
he looks like a jackass. 

272 
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,633 
Put some pressure on him. 
He'll leak something. 

273 
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:20,998 
Sounds like fun. 

274 
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,037 
Don't take these guys lightly. 

275 
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,831 
They train hard. 

276 
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,944 
They're ready for anything, 
maybe even for you. 

277 
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,011 
You might may want to have a plan this time. 

278 
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,077 
You wanna know what my plan is? 

279 
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,712 
They're all going back to 
the desert in body bags. 

280 
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,153 
Where Allah won't even be able to use 
dental records to recognize them. 

281 
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,151 
Yeah. 

282 
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:11,284 
Are you gonna get in 'em,
or do I have to make ya? 

283 
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,581 
I thought we talked about this. 

284 
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,220 
You're right, here it is. 

285 
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,456 
It's still half my house too, right? 

286 
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,863 
You'll get your half. 

287 
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,760 
Come on you really wanna sell? 
 

288 
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,329 
Do you really want to do this? 

289 
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,131 
Look at you! 

290 
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,836 
Look at your face! 

291 
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,072 
Vampires again? 

292 
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,645 
I can't handle seeing you like this. 

293 
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,218 
- It's not fair to me. 
- I'm chasing bad guys baby. 

294 
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,889 
Look, I'm trying to make a difference. 

295 
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,754 
Can't we just give it another shot? 

296 
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,997 
I mean we love each other. 

297 
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,538 
You can quit your job. 

298 
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,836 
- Don't ask me to do that. 
- You can start over. 

299 
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,838 
We can start over. 

300 
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,484 
I ... 

301 
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,184 
I'm sorry. 

302 
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,193 
I gotta go. 

303 
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,635 
I told you, get in the body bags! 

304 
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,671 
- Help me! 
- What is wrong? 

305 
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,401 
The great Satan, 
the man with the dream powers ... 

306 
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:49,945 
Yes? 

307 
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,109 
He's here. 

308 
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,551 
A Jew! 

309 
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,924 
Where's your boss? 

310 
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,528 
- I cannot tell you. 
- I can start carving. 

311 
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,544 
Pain is only temporary compared to 
what will happen to me if I talk. 

312 
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,583 
Uh, we've been instructed to ask you,
to uh, bite us ...

313 
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,611 
if we ever ran into you and well... 

314 
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,216 
So ... bite me. 

315 
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,090 
Why do you guys always think 
I'm gonna turn you? 

316 
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,686 
So you can blow yourselfs up
over and over again? 

317 
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,362 
Please? 

318 
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,414 
- I can't believe you just did that. 
- Yeah? 

319 
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,109 
Does it hurt? 

320 
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:05,420 
No. 

321 
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:07,949 
A punch of the skin? 

322 
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,191 
What's wrong with you? 

323 
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,260 
What am I supposed to shoot you with? 

324 
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:21,300 
Well now you got to put up with the 
smell of garlic while I kick your ass. 

325 
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,642 
Come one get up. 

326 
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:16,092 
- We done? 
- Yeah yeah ... 

327 
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,728 
ended. 

328 
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,868 
You know, after I rest a little, 

329 
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,368 
Im gonna knock you in the walls and stuff. 

330 
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,077 
You're probably gonna lose that arm. 

331 
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,680 
I'm not giving up. 

332 
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,612 
- Yeah, I figured. 
- How do you look at yourself in the mirror? 

333 
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,049 
You want to know how it works right? 

334 
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:56,155 
Demons. 
Thousands of demons. 

335 
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:01,160 
- They posses me, to be made to this. 
- Even one demon is pretty damn evil. 

336 
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,699 
Yeah, you think? 

337 
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,141 
They don't get to call the shots, I do. 

338 
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,939 
How much will power does that take? 

339 
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,376 
You know exactly how much it takes. 

340 
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,220 
- So if you they changed you this much why 
- Think of it this way 

341 
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,045 
Everyone has a dark side. 

342 
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,485 
You were a cross so you understand 
that it's sin, so just call it evil. 

343 
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,886 
For me it's a little more literal, 
sure but it's ... 

344 
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,956 
It's all how you acknowledge it 
and don't let it control you. 

345 
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,898 
So if you're so good, how can   
be killed looking at a cross? 

346 
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,434 
Some sort of biochemical reaction that...

347 
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,397 
No gee, I don't know. I think I just 
told you something about demons? 

348 
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,372 
They just can't take it. 

349 
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:42,972 
They're the problem, not me. 

350 
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,103 
Yes but they give you all that strength. 

351 
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:49,651 
Yeah. And I'm not gonna let it go to waste

352 
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,552 
If I can make 'em all my bitch, 
I'll use this power for truth, 

353 
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,490 
<i> justice and the American way. </ i> 

354 
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,058 
You're a demon possessed vampire. 

355 
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,158 
- It's my duty to take you out. 
- Ill tell you what. 

356 
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,793 
You stop sinning, I'll let
you take me out. How's that? 

357 
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,158 
Bite me. 

358 
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,069 
Is that a sin or a request? 

359 
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,678 
Don't bite me! 

360 
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:34,963 
Psst, Rip, come here. 

361 
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:41,533 
You okay? 

362 
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,137 
You're gonna blow this thing. 
You need to lay off man. 

363 
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:45,939 
Allright listen to me 
we can handle this. 

364 
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,642 
Look, I'm not on this right? 

365 
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,776 
I'm working something else. 

366 
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,778 
Obviously you need help with it, 
whatever it is. 

367 
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:58,086 
Hey, Rip, you need a hospital. 

368 
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,516 
I just want you to know that 
I wasn't stepping on your toes. 

369 
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,756 
Stay safe, allright? 

370 
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,052 
They're all dead. 

371 
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,292 
Who did it? What did you see? 

372 
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,159 
I asked him to bite me. 

373 
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,261 
Something is coming. 

374 
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,232 
He's coming for us all. 

375 
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,769 
No more failure! 
It will not be tolerated! 

376 
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:57,179 
Give him ten lashes. 
That should cure him of his fears. 

377 
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:04,313 
- Thank you! Thank you master! 
- Whatever it is, we are ready for it. 

378 
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,233 
Oh, you really cut it close tonight. 

379 
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,033 
Don't tell me it was that cop again.

380 
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,402 
You're too valuable to let a guy
like that keep you out all night. 

381 
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,970 
- We both know what can happen. 
- Don't worry about me. 

382 
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,210 
I had time to kill. 

383 
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:34,509 
Why don't you think about 
killing more then time 

384 
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,249 
the next time you see him again? 

385 
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,489 
Now, we picked up some shatter and confirmed, 

386 
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,120 
You really screwed up tonight. 

387 
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,093 
You were seen by a Zubri. 

388 
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,063 
How bad? 

389 
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,427 
This could turn out really serious. 

390 
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,734 
Maybe they'll be ready for you this time. 

391 
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,676 
Hey eh, can I talk to you for a minute? 

392 
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,011 
About what? 

393 
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,547 
I think I found some evidence
and it doesn't add up.

394 
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,425 
I wanted to ask you about it. 

395 
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:18,783 
Like? 

396 
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,255 
Vampires. 

397 
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,964 
- What? Come on, go screw yourself. 
- No, I'm serious! 

398 
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,869 
I eh, I believe it, I think 
I can help you prove it. 

399 
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,421 
- Allright. 
- So, uh, tell me about this vampire. 

400 
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,920 
- What do you wanna know? 
- Who is he? What does he do? 

401 
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,262 
You can see what he does. 

402 
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,798 
He's a sadistic killer. 

403 
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,626 
You've read all the reports right? 
It's all in there. 

404 
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,098 
Alone? 
Are you screwing with me? 

405 
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,274 
- How does he do all that? 
- Intense right?

406 
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:09,545 
- What, does he dodge bullets? 
- No, no, he doesn't have to. 

407 
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,447 
It's not his style. 
He'd rather just take it and keep smiling. 

408 
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,378 
So what happens? 

409 
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:16,809 
He just heals right back up. 

410 
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,086 
Yeah, oh, one more thing. 

411 
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,022 
He's huge and he's strong.

412 
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,884 
I mean this guy can throw a guy farther 
then you and I can trust him that's for sure. 

413 
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,256 
Yeah! What else can he do? 

414 
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,898 
When he gets angry,
and he has enough energy, 

415 
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,806 
He can actually hear his heartbeat grow
louder and louder before every kill

416 
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,476 
Oh, and this is the strangest part. 

417 
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,737 
He messes with electronic equipment
and it's like...

418 
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:49,115 
radio frequencies and television receptions
and stuff, I mean.

419 
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:55,420 
- No kidding, so can he fly? 
- Yeah. I asked him that one time. 

420 
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,951 
He explained to me that it takes too
much energy to fly all the time. 
 

421 
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,994 
I mean do you run as fast as you can
everywhere all of the time?

422 
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,101 
No, it makes sense 

423 
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,232 
So what else? Garlic? 

424 
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,007 
No. Only annoys him. 

425 
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,469 
Silver Bullets?

426 
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,339 
- I tried them, they don't work. 
- Does he bite? 

427 
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,645 
No, of course not. 
He will not bite anyone. 

428 
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:24,575 
Apparently he's the last vampire. 
He's not gonna turn anyone else either. 

429 
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,658 
He's not gonna turn anyone else!

430 
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,551 
You're a killer Van Helsing, Rip. 

431 
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,490 
- Son of ... 
- I've come to suck your blood. 

432 
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,423 
Enough! 

433 
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,600 
In my office now! 

434 
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,870 
The rest of you get back to work! 

435 
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,871 
Do you want to tell me what that was all about? 

436 
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,286 
Fine! Do you want to tell 
what this is all about? 

437 
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,020 
I told you it's all in there. 

438 
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,460 
Yeah, well, except for the little part
you left out about monsters.

439 
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,064 
Internal affairs wants a psych test.

440 
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,326 
That's great. 

441 
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,432 
Whatever they say goes. 
If you pass you'll get 30 days probation. 

442 
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,793 
If you fail ... 

443 
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,399 
sorry it's out of my hands.

444 
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,439 
No one puts in the hours I put in. 

445 
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,844 
I'm dedicated to my work 
and you know it. 

446 
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,442 
Well then convince them. 

447 
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,976 
Talk about vampires 
and see what they have to say. 

448 
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,444 
It's simple ... I mean, come one

449 
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,454 
Allright, we were just messing around
we joke around like this all the time.

450 
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,524 
When was the last time you get some rest? 

451 
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,521 
A while. 

452 
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,165 
<i> Go home, get some sleep. </ i> 

453 
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,802 
I'll push back your evaluation 
until this evening. 

454 
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,338 
If I had a home. 

455 
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,646 
Excuse me I mean no disrespect but,

456 
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:07,215 
once we complete the tunnel, 
how will we get through that? 

457 
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,883 
It would take us a year, 
and no man could survive going inside. 

458 
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,788 
Do not worry brother. 

459 
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,991 
Allah will provide. 

460 
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,359 
Soon we will eclipse the 
Manhattan raid so much,

461 
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:24,629 
The world will never even remember it. 

462 
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:26,466 
 

463 
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,814 
New intel.
We're hearing about some sort of genie. 

464 
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,653 
A goat demon of some sort.

465 
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:41,422 
Yeah right. 

466 
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,756 
I wouldn't take this lightly if were you. 

467 
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,122 
Yeah? Why not? 

468 
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,665 
I eat Gen for breakfast. 
They are saying it's a Merin, 

469 
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,599 
The most dangerous of the Gen 

470 
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,999 
This is not a fairy tale. 

471 
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:58,438 
Are you serious? 

472 
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,769 
You expect me to believe this? 

473 
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,178 
You're real aren't you? 

474 
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,589 
Listen, I've been doing some thinking, 

475 
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,201 
and I might gonna have to quit. 

476 
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:29,598 
I might get fired. 

477 
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,398 
They can't trust you either? 

478 
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,369 
Yeah they eh, they think I'm crazy too. 

479 
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,008 
Well there's something wrong with you. 

480 
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,675 
Look I just want to know if there's 
a chance for us if I do. 

481 
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,445 
What do you want me to say Rip? 

482 
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,022 
Yes. 

483 
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,883 
- Not when you look like a train wreck! 
- What do you want me to do? 

484 
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,095 
What do you want me to do? 
Do you want me to show you the vampire! 

485 
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,094 
Do you honestly think 
that's what I want? 

486 
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,234 
I'm sorry. 

487 
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,469 
I gotta go. 

488 
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,374 
I'm sorry. 

489 
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,050 
Damn vampire. 


490
00:41:18, 209 --> 00: 41:20, 211
First my wife and now my job.

491
00:41:47, 438 --> 00: 41:48, 974
Who is the raisin head?

492
00:41:52, 343 --> 00: 41:55, 153
He's our new dealer.
He has been checked out.

493
00:41:56, 647 --> 00: 41:58, 718
I have the status update you requested.

494
00:41:59, 216 --> 00: 42:02, 891
The project will be completed
and ready by friday night.

495
00:42:03, 587 --> 00: 42:05, 760
Excellent, excellent.

496
00:42:24, 475--> 00: 42:26, 546
Our informant's tracking device is down.

497
00:42:27, 578--> 00: 42:28, 113
We know why.

498
00:42:29, 680--> 00: 42:32, 160
-He must be in some kind of fortified
-underground layer?

499
00:42:32, 483--> 00: 42:33, 393
Yeah.

500
00:42:33, 984--> 00: 42:36, 965
We're getting all kinds of 
seismic readings from this area

501
00:42:38, 389--> 00: 42:40, 926
How safe do you feel on the
streets of your city

502
00:42:41, 325--> 00: 42:43, 737
knowing that the very officials
payed to protect you

503
00:42:43, 961--> 00: 42:46, 168
Are using their power to harm you?

504
00:42:46, 397--> 00: 42:48, 138
In tonights edition I will
show you evidence,

505
00:42:48, 365--> 00: 42:50, 242
of rampant government corruption.

506
00:42:50, 434--> 00: 42:53, 210
Public servants infecting our city
and our nation

507
00:42:53, 637--> 00: 42:56, 846
A peace officer purposely detonates
a crime scene.

508
00:42:57, 041--> 00: 42:59, 612
We learned that this same 
peace officer was also involved

509
00:42:59, 877--> 00: 43:01, 914
in the recent warehouse massacre.

510
00:43:02, 179--> 00: 43:04, 887
where were 58 innocent people
were found slayen.

511
00:43:06, 884--> 00: 43:07, 589
I got it.

512
00:43:07, 785--> 00: 43:09, 924
Why are we not allowed to
reveal his identity?

513
00:43:10, 588--> 00: 43:14, 365
Government regulations restricting
the very freedom of this broadcast.

514
00:43:15, 726--> 00: 43:19, 139
This footage was captured mere
minutes after the incident.

515
00:43:19, 630--> 00: 43:21, 974
What kind of back alley deal was this?

516
00:43:23, 267--> 00: 43:25, 577
Here is why you should be concerned.

517
00:43:28, 038--> 00: 43:35, 718
Allah Akbar.

518
00:43:38, 048--> 00: 43:45, 694
Allah Akbar.

519
00:43:46, 123--> 00: 43:49, 002
-Allah Akbar.
-This is my favorite part.

520
00:43:55, 366--> 00: 43:57, 039
This will be recorded.

521
00:44:01, 705--> 00: 44:06, 552
Case number 1156743,
Rip Lancaster.

522
00:44:06, 877--> 00: 44:10, 848
Questioning will encompass all
case work for the past 18 months.

523
00:44:11, 181--> 00: 44:12, 558
State your name please.

524
00:44:17, 221--> 00: 44:19, 132
Thank you for meeting with us.

525
00:44:20, 758--> 00: 44:22, 032
Let's talk business.

526
00:44:22, 393--> 00: 44:23, 371
Let's.

527
00:44:23, 794--> 00: 44:25, 637
We would like you to give us details

528
00:44:25, 896--> 00: 44:28, 376
on the police officer you 
profiled on your show.

529
00:44:28, 832--> 00: 44:31, 870
His name, where he works, 
where he lives.

530
00:44:32, 436--> 00: 44:33, 779
What's in it for me?

531
00:44:36, 340--> 00: 44:38, 877
This, $2 million.

532
00:44:39, 209--> 00: 44:42, 622
And we will also give you 
the story of your career.

533
00:44:43, 480--> 00: 44:45, 892
We'll even tell you where to park your van.

534
00:44:48, 552--> 00: 44:50, 361
Let's get right to the heart of it.

535
00:44:51, 188--> 00: 44:53, 361
Do you believe in vampires?

536
00:44:53, 557--> 00: 44:58, 199
Yeah, I mean, no.
Look, it's just a hobby.

537
00:44:58, 462--> 00: 44:59, 998
You mean hunting vampires?

538
00:45:00, 097--> 00: 45:03, 476
Not, of course not.
Look, I just read about them.

539
00:45:03, 667--> 00: 45:05, 340
You know? Thats all.

540
00:45:19, 049--> 00: 45:19, 754
Oh, no.

541
00:45:20, 384--> 00: 45:22, 921
Allah Akbar.

542
00:45:23, 721--> 00: 45:25, 325
This is my favorite part.

543
00:45:26, 190--> 00: 45:30, 138
Allah Akbar.
Allah Akbar.

544
00:45:31, 929--> 00: 45:32, 805
Here.

545
00:45:34, 832--> 00: 45:36, 937
They've already isolated the back room.

546
00:45:38, 302--> 00: 45:39, 474
Massive digging.

547
00:45:39, 937--> 00: 45:41, 917
That confirms the seismic readings.

548
00:45:43, 307--> 00: 45:45, 844
They'll have their location 
pinpointed any second.

549
00:45:56, 553--> 00: 45:57, 588
I'm sorry, Rip.

550
00:46:00, 758--> 00: 46:01, 634
Yeah.

551
00:46:13, 537--> 00: 46:14, 914
You gonna be okay?

552
00:46:27, 785--> 00: 46:30, 356
I least know who to call if
I ever run into a vampire.

553
00:46:33, 624--> 00: 46:34, 500
Thanks.

554
00:46:36, 026--> 00: 46:37, 369
I don't believe in vampires.

555
00:47:37, 688--> 00: 47:39, 690
We have to take out Bob, ASAP.

556
00:47:40, 390--> 00: 47:42, 893
-They're about to go nuclear.
-I won't let that happen.

557
00:47:44, 394--> 00: 47:45, 737
Now remember,

558
00:47:46, 230--> 00: 47:50, 576
This genie is unlike any enemy
you've ever fought before.

559
00:47:51, 702--> 00: 47:54, 080
I'm not sure you're aware
of the dangers it may pose.

560
00:47:54, 438--> 00: 47:55, 781
From what I read in the file,

561
00:47:55, 939--> 00: 47:58, 852
I'm assuming that I can take it out
with extra fire power save enough.

562
00:47:59, 209--> 00: 48:00, 950
You'll get all the fire power you want.

563
00:48:05, 315--> 00: 48:09, 161
Your primary objective
is an executive order.

564
00:48:21, 598--> 00: 48:23, 635
You can do whatever is deemed necessary

565
00:48:23, 967--> 00: 48:28, 416
to rid the world of this blue eyed 
....... sack of feces.

566
00:48:48, 792--> 00: 48:49, 793
It's him.

567
00:48:51, 628--> 00: 48:53, 005
Do they have my wife?

568
00:48:53, 630--> 00: 48:55, 735
Yeah, they got your girl.

569
00:49:02, 239--> 00: 49:03, 684
He's on his way.

570
00:49:18, 322--> 00: 49:19, 266
Show me.

571
00:49:35, 405--> 00: 49:36, 679
What the?

572
00:49:41, 545--> 00: 49:43, 525
You just killed the guy 
that knows where my wife is!

573
00:49:43, 914--> 00: 49:47, 726
I just did you a big favor.
He was leading you into a trap.

574
00:50:07, 137--> 00: 50:08, 912
Now it's your turn to do me a favor.

575
00:50:09, 206--> 00: 50:12, 187
Ah yeah? What do I get out of it?
Are you gonna help me find my wife?

576
00:50:12, 509--> 00: 50:16, 548
I'll let you live.

577
00:50:21, 018--> 00: 50:23, 328
So you still haven't figured
out which side your on?

578
00:50:23, 553--> 00: 50:25, 362
I'm on yours that's for damn sure..

579
00:50:27, 824--> 00: 50:29, 804
You know there's only two 
things you need from me

580
00:50:30, 527--> 00: 50:32, 029
a cross and a wooden stake.

581
00:50:32, 729--> 00: 50:36, 267
-Yeah get back all that extra stuff.
-It makes me feel comfortable.

582
00:50:39, 036--> 00: 50:40, 515
Does that feel comfortable?

583
00:51:20, 510--> 00: 51:22, 547
-So what do you want from me?
-Instead of getting in my way,

584
00:51:23, 346--> 00: 51:25, 519
why don't you help me this time, deal?

585
00:51:26, 283--> 00: 51:28, 511
Not quite. These guys got my wife
I want you to help me.

586
00:51:27, 524--> 00: 51:28, 763


587
00:51:29, 152--> 00: 51:31, 723
-No, you help me.
-No, you'll help me!

588
00:51:35, 425--> 00: 51:36, 233
Don't move!

589
00:51:46, 203--> 00: 51:48, 114
I notice you have been
taken credit for my work

590
00:51:48, 872--> 00: 51:51, 478
-How's that working out for your career?
-We'll talk about that later.

591
00:51:52, 142--> 00: 51:54, 884
-You know I had nothing to do with it.
-Yeah right.

592
00:52:03, 286--> 00: 52:07, 428
-I know you're obsessed.
-You're full of it, that's a bunch of bull.

593
00:52:07, 791--> 00: 52:09, 896
You see the last guy that came 
after me this hard,

594
00:52:10, 660--> 00: 52:12, 503
He ended up in a mental institution.

595
00:52:13, 597--> 00: 52:14, 735
You're doing much better.

596
00:52:15, 098--> 00: 52:17, 738
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna help you
until you agree to help me first.

597
00:52:21, 905--> 00: 52:23, 851
Looks like you're doing a pretty good job.

598
00:52:26, 977--> 00: 52:28, 012
I know.

599
00:52:35, 085--> 00: 52:36, 860
Still think you should be arresting these guys?

600
00:52:37, 120--> 00: 52:39, 361
Oh, this is self-defense.
Fully justifiable.

601
00:52:42, 192--> 00: 52:43, 398
Nice work.

602
00:52:43, 760--> 00: 52:44, 704
Thanks.

603
00:53:13, 790--> 00: 53:14, 530


604
00:53:14, 991--> 00: 53:15, 833
- How long?
- Two more minutes.

605
00:53:16, 126--> 00: 53:17, 434
Make it one and a half.

606
00:53:18, 195--> 00: 53:21, 199
Everybody, hurry, hurry.

607
00:53:24, 467--> 00: 53:25, 571
His name is...

608
00:53:26, 436--> 00: 53:30, 714
Muhammad Akeem Bin Fatah Ulama
Ahmed Salim Fahid Abdulla Hasan.

609
00:53:31, 208--> 00: 53:32, 710
Nevermind, we're calling him Bob.

610
00:53:34, 277--> 00: 53:37, 349
These guys are as evil as they come.
They kill children for fun.

611
00:53:37, 647--> 00: 53:40, 184
If they've got your wife,
It's not looking to good for her, pal.

612
00:53:42, 185--> 00: 53:43, 789
They are about to do something big.

613
00:53:44, 554--> 00: 53:45, 897
We have to stop them.

614
00:53:46, 623--> 00: 53:47, 601
Ready?

615
00:53:49, 326--> 00: 53:50, 361
For what?

616
00:53:51, 127--> 00: 53:53, 664
-To kill Bob and his goons.
-Maybe you misunderstood something here.

617
00:53:54, 064--> 00: 53:56, 340
-I'm not helping you.
-Listen to me.

618
00:53:56, 633--> 00: 53:58, 579
-They have a nuke.
-Here?

619
00:53:59, 202--> 00: 54:02, 581
-Yeah. I need your help, Rip.
-No. No, wait, wait.

620
00:54:03, 640--> 00: 54:05, 085
I'm not going in there with you.

621
00:54:05, 675--> 00: 54:07, 245
-It's too intense.
-Rip.

622
00:54:07, 911--> 00: 54:09, 482
If I go out there and get killed, 
you'll end up alone and be forced  

623
00:54:09, 547--> 00: 54:12, 349
to save the world and your wife all by yourself.

624
00:54:13, 049--> 00: 54:14, 357
Is that what you want?

625
00:54:17, 354--> 00: 54:20, 130
Allright fine. Um, 
let's do things my way allright

626
00:54:20, 423--> 00: 54:22, 425
We sneak the rest of the way
and try to find my wife first.

627
00:54:23, 660--> 00: 54:25, 333
I think we better go ahead 
and do things my way.

628
00:54:25, 562--> 00: 54:27, 269
No, no, my way!

629
00:54:28, 965--> 00: 54:32, 936
Loud and proud, baby.
The American Way.

630
00:55:10, 707--> 00: 55:12, 516
Break out the violins.

631
00:55:37, 233--> 00: 55:38, 439
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

632
00:55:39, 202--> 00: 55:41, 239
Put it there, Zubri!

633
00:55:43, 239--> 00: 55:44, 081
Move.

634
00:55:59, 122--> 00: 56:00, 430
This is your Virgin, Bob.

635
00:56:05, 862--> 00: 56:09, 241
You! Are ... right?

636
00:56:57, 046--> 00: 56:57, 922
Now I'm out.

637
00:57:01, 551--> 00: 57:03, 199
-You got any more tricks up your sleeve huh?
-Just one.

638
00:57:03, 252--> 00: 57:03, 594


639
00:57:05, 388--> 00: 57:06, 696
Kicking ass!

640
00:57:33, 583--> 00: 57:35, 358
Now I'm out.

641
00:57:36, 352--> 00: 57:37, 956
Exact number of bullets.

642
01:00:07, 904 --> 01:00:13, 547
At lomg last, for the first time,
in over 6,000 years.

643
01:00:14, 644 --> 01:00:17, 750
I have brought you here
for a great purpose.

644
01:00:24, 287--> 01:00:26, 324
There is much to be done.

645
01:01:33, 589 --> 01:01:36, 536
Put it inside, and close it tight.

646
01:02:22, 472 --> 01:02:23, 382
Hurry.

647
01:02:35, 518 --> 01:02:36 724
Where? Where?

648
01:02:39, 122 --> 01:02:40, 692
Nothing's wrong?

649
01:02:46, 129 --> 01:02:48, 006
Leave me, leave me.

650
01:02:50, 032 --> 01:02:51, 010
Go.

651
01:03:00, 243 --> 01:03:07, 092
Come.

652
01:03:08, 818 --> 01:03:11, 958
It's about time that you warmed up to me.

653
01:05:12, 875 --> 01:05:15, 253
The genie has obtained the material.

654
01:05:16, 279 --> 01:05:19, 260
You woman distract me from Jihad!

655
01:05:21, 684 --> 01:05:22, 890
Bring the chest.

656
01:05:31, 627 --> 01:05:32, 697
I got it.

657
01:05:36, 299 --> 01:05:38, 939
The genie that belongs inside of it,
now that he's free,

658
01:05:41, 404 --> 01:05:43, 127
It will be used in unspeakable ways.

659
01:05:43, 140 --> 01:05:44, 874
Well, how do I stop it?

660
01:05:45, 608 --> 01:05:48, 885
You must drib the fresh blood of
a virgin girl into the mouth of the skull

661
01:05:49, 145--> 01:05:51, 682
and recite an ancient Arabic recall passage

662
01:05:51, 847--> 01:05:53, 690
in order to get the genie back into the skull

663
01:05:54, 083--> 01:05:55, 960
and to save your friend's life.

664
01:05:57, 687 --> 01:05:58, 927
Allright, so who's the Virgin?

665
01:05:59, 288 --> 01:06:00, 289
I am.

666
01:06:00, 323 --> 01:06:02, 368
Ok, do you know what to say?

667
01:06:02, 725 --> 01:06:04, 796
I know exactly what to say,

668
01:06:05, 461 --> 01:06:07, 873
-Word for Word.
-OK, good. Let's go.

669
01:06:42, 064 --> 01:06:49, 482
-Allah Akbar.
-Allah Akbar.

670
01:06:51, 007--> 01:06:52, 452
Well, I'm sorry.
What was it again?

671
01:06:59,  448 -->01:07:00, 518
I'm ok.

672
01:07:01, 717 --> 01:07:03, 287
Look at my lips, huh?

673
01:07:10, 659 --> 01:07:11, 967
I can't do that.

674
01:07:21, 070 --> 01:07:22, 378
Allright, this is bad.

675
01:07:23, 005 --> 01:07:26, 043
-You haven't said it right, not even once.
-Sorry. It's weird.

676
01:07:26, 275 --> 01:07:28, 084
Just give me a few more tries,
I'll spit it out.

677
01:07:28, 644 --> 01:07:30, 920
You might only have the chance
to say it once.

678
01:08:03, 646 --> 01:08:05, 216
Come here, son of a bitch!

679
01:08:07, 349 --> 01:08:09, 590
Papa, it's gone!

680
01:08:18, 194 --> 01:08:20, 606
Careful, careful!

681
01:08:43, 686 --> 01:08:46, 098
No!

682
01:08:54, 263 --> 01:08:56, 470
Run!

683
01:09:16,  418--> 01:09:17, 453
You did it.

684
01:09:18, 387 --> 01:09:19, 798
In English.

685
01:09:21, 724 --> 01:09:22, 828
What's wrong?

686
01:09:26, 061 --> 01:09:30, 066
When a persons blood is used on the skull,
a life is taken

687
01:09:30, 399 --> 01:09:32, 072
You didn't mention that. No.

688
01:09:32, 968 --> 01:09:35, 448
I knew you would not have done it
if you would know.

689
01:09:35, 704 --> 01:09:42, 553
-Why? I'm responsible for you.
-No. I did this. I cut myself.

690
01:09:43, 579 --> 01:09:46, 685
I did it to save the others.
For Aisha.

691
01:10:10, 039 --> 01:10:11, 677
You see what that girl did for you?

692
01:10:11, 941 --> 01:10:13, 716
I hope you realize...

693
01:10:16, 312 --> 01:10:17, 347
Hey, you okay?

694
01:10:18, 380 --> 01:10:19, 654
Are you yourself?

695
01:10:21, 116 --> 01:10:23, 357
I feel so dirty.

696
01:10:27, 356 --> 01:10:28, 835
He violated me.

697
01:10:30, 593 --> 01:10:33, 199
So it's kind of like you went to prison

698
01:10:35, 264 --> 01:10:38, 268
Thanks buddy. I owe you one.

699
01:10:39, 568 --> 01:10:41, 275
Allright, let's go save my wife.

700
01:10:41, 403 --> 01:10:43, 314
If we don't stop the meltdown and get the bomb

701
01:10:44, 240 --> 01:10:45, 082
We're all dead.

702
01:10:45, 641 --> 01:10:47, 177
Fine, let's hurry.

703
01:11:19, 341 --> 01:11:21, 321
- Follow me!
- Yes!

704
01:11:22, 378 --> 01:11:23, 716
This way!

705
01:11:44, 266 --> 01:11:47, 611
We are close, but we may still 
need our insurance policy.

706
01:11:48, 003--> 01:11:49, 243
Go and get it.

707
01:11:54, 276 --> 01:11:55, 949
It's all sealed.

708
01:11:56, 745 --> 01:11:59, 521
Now the bomb.
And then your wife.

709
01:12:00, 783 --> 01:12:02, 456
You're not looking to good, pal.

710
01:12:03, 319--> 01:12:04, 593
You know, I was just thinking.

711
01:12:06, 288 --> 01:12:07, 892
If she sees you.

712
01:12:08, 257 --> 01:12:09, 634
She'll believe me, she will love me again.

713
01:12:10, 392 --> 01:12:13, 236
Yeah, and maybe you'll get lucky tonight, huh?

714
01:12:14, 797 --> 01:12:15, 969
Come on, get up.

715
01:12:17, 166 --> 01:12:19, 043
I want my life back.

716
01:12:20, 035 --> 01:12:21, 105
And my work.

717
01:12:23, 005 --> 01:12:25, 451
If they'd all could see you were real,
I'd get my job back.

718
01:12:25, 908 --> 01:12:28, 286
You don't really want to get back
to that job, do you?

719
01:12:29, 712 --> 01:12:31, 350
I like chasing bad guys.

720
01:12:31, 947 --> 01:12:33, 893
Well, then, get up
and let's go get some.

721
01:12:38, 921 --> 01:12:42, 164
Come on. Is that all you
got for me tonight?

722
01:12:42, 791 --> 01:12:43, 792
Get up.

723
01:12:51, 800 --> 01:12:54, 280
-Use me as a shield.
-It'll be fun.

724
01:15:12, 407 --> 01:15:16, 446
-Allah!
-Carrie!

725
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:27,995
Rip!

726
01:15:55,554 --> 01:15:57,995
Hey buddy, can you do me a favor?

727
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:01,295
Can I see my wife please?

728
01:16:01,554 --> 01:16:03,995
I wish I could pal.

729
01:16:04,754 --> 01:16:07,295
But you're on your own for good this time.

730
01:16:07,754 --> 01:16:10,995
What? Don't you just heal back 
and back up again?

731
01:16:16,454 --> 01:16:18,395
Not this time.

732
01:16:26,754 --> 01:16:30,222
God, I'm gonna die.

733
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:36,995
Hey, look at the bright side.
I'm finally out of your hair.

734
01:16:39,754 --> 01:16:42,995
- This hurts man
- Tell me about it

735
01:16:44,754 --> 01:16:46,995
Huh? It even hurts you?

736
01:16:47,054 --> 01:16:48,995
I mean you being a bloodsucker and all.

737
01:16:49,254 --> 01:16:50,795
- Hey Rip.
- Yeah.

737
01:16:51,454 --> 01:16:53,495
I got a stake through my heart.

738
01:16:59,454 --> 01:17:03,495
Hey, what's your name anyway?

739
01:17:07,054 --> 01:17:11,195
Who has protected you from me today?

740
01:17:11,554 --> 01:17:13,800
You may wanna step a little closer, pal.

741
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:16,295
Can't you see we're both dying here, you idiot?

741
01:17:16,554 --> 01:17:21,695
No one has protected you for
the angels fight for me!

742
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:24,695
I know what angels you're talking about.

743
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:28,695
The ones with sulphur breath,
you just got lucky that's all.

743
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,695
Luck has nothing got to do with it

744
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,695
Allah, most merciful watches over me
and guides us in Jihad!

745
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,695
Then why don't you show some
of that mercy to my wife?

746
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,295
Let her go.

745
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Let me tell you what I will 
do to your filthy pig of a wife!

746
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,495
I'm going to take her head off.

747
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,495
Nice and slow!

746
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:03,995
I will give you her head
if you're still alive.

747
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,495
Maybe I will bring in a video
so that you can watch.

748
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:14,095
I'll tell you where you can stick that knife.

749
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,495
- I already know where to stick it.
- Yeah?

749
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,495
Come on over here and show me.

749
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,495
Don't you fool, it's a trick!

750
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,195
Come on, chicken shit!

751
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,795
- Don't go anywhere
- I'll be here.

752
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:41,395
- Don't you touch her!
- Or what?

753
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:45,295
What are you going to do?

754
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,795
Listen to me, very carefully.

755
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,295
I want you to get a sword
and chop his head off.

756
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,295
Then I want you to take his fangs
and give them to me.

757
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,295
And then put his head in 
a mirrored box and bury it.

758
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,295
Do you understand?

759
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:19,295
We have seen the last of your kind.
Enjoy your pain!

760
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,095
Please don't!

761
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,095
Oh, please don't!

762
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,395
I wish I was dead so I didn't have to hear this.

763
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,095
No! Don't! Don't cut me!

764
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,095
You bastard, you bit me!

765
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,095
- I just saved your life.
- No you didn't, you just killed me!

766
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,695
Whatever, You said you wished you were dead


767
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,595
Oh, so you're still a genie!


768
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,895
You were gonna die anyway.
Now you'll still be around.

769
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:41,895
So ... I can still save her?

770
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,295
Yes, but you won't be able to be with here again.

781
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:49,895
- But she's my wife.
- I don't make the rules, trust me okay?

782
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,895
Besides, I bet your vow was
"till death do us part" Well...

783
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,595
Now you're dead ... so part.

784
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,295
Allright Look, fuck, can we,lets just 
agree this of so I can get back there?

785
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,795
Relax for a second,
what time is passing?

786
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,595
We're in the spiritual world now...

787
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,795
When you get back, you better hurry up.

788
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,095
Every few hundred years we pass a torch.

789
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,495
When we're tired we find a place for it

790
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,195
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

791
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,395
You gonna be okay?

792
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,195
You set me up.

793
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,195
- You tricked me.
- Would you have given up if I hadn't told you?

794
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,595
I've been training you...

795
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,595
Come on, get up!

796
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,595
Come on, get up.

797
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:54,595
Nice work

798
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,895
- I'll let you live
- Don't bite me!

799
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:03,395
- I've given you a gift
- Oh, a gift!

800
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,895
You have a commitment to justice
unlike anyone I've ever seen.

801
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,795
You're stubborn, determined,
all the things you need to be.

802
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,395
- So I can, still be good?
- I'm counting on it.

803
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,395
Get up and let's go get some

804
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,195
A good vampire.

805
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,195
I guess I can do that.

806
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,195
You start now.

807
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,495
IRS building.
Headquarters, downstairs.

808
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,795
Death and taxes, baby.

809
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,995
Save the world, Rip.

810
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,095
And save your wife.

811
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,895
The rules are simple,
drink their blood after you kill them.

812
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,995
Or else they'll come back.

813
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,895
Go get them.

814
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,495
Stay on night shift.

815
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:13,295
And I almost forgot,
my name is....

816
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,195
What were you gonna do with my wife huh?

817
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,395
Was it this?

818
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,695
Look at me.

819
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,195
I'm so sorry.

820
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,095
If only I had listened.

821
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:29,895
If only I'd quit you first.

822
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,595
Stay with me.

823
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,895
I'm sorry.

824
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,595
I gotta go.

825
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Open wide.

826
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,400
And say Allah.

827
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,400
No Zubri, Zubri, no, no! Zubri, Zubri!!!

828
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,400
Go ahead and kill me!

829
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:49,400
Tonight I will be in paradise enjoying my virgins.
And pleasures you can only dream of.

830
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,400
Yeah, you're not going to paradise.

831
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,400
Here's a preview...
of what you have to look forward to.

831
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:05,400
And where you're going,
you are the virgins!

832
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,400
It's her smile I miss the most.

833
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,400
It's my fault things headed this way really.

834
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,000
We're sorry to see him go,
but he must have picked you for a reason.

835
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:38,600
Welcome aboard,
we are honored to have you.

836
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:46,000
He's gone Sir, he's gone.
But he did find his replacement.

837
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,800
Have him checked out.

838
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,800
Make sure we're still save.

839
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,400
Why? 

840 
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:58,100 
Most people have no idea 
what kinds of things, monsters really exist.

841 
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,500 
It creeps me out.

842 
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,500 
Evil is out there and I'm gonna find it
and I'll put it where it belongs 
even if I have to do it alone.

843 
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,900 
The Devil's gonna pay.

844 
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:15,500 
I know what I'm doing.

845 
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,900 
I think.

846 
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:24,900
