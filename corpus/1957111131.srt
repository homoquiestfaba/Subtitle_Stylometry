1
00:00:00,835 --> 00:00:04,422
(Bridgestone jingle music)

2
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,570
(mellow guitar music)

3
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,191
(Mike sighs)

4
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,443
- Okay, here's some juice.

5
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,111
There you go.

6
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:11,739
- [Mike] I'm Michael, but
everyone calls me Mike.

7
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,200
That's my little sister, Faith.

8
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:16,702
- Mom, Mike has my pen.

9
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,746
- [Mike] She's a pain.

10
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,874
- Honey, stop harassing
him and you know what?

11
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,209
I'm going to make this to go

12
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,919
so you can eat it
in the car, okay?

13
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:27,087
- [Mike] That's my dad.

14
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,672
- Hey Mike, you and
Faith better hurry up.

15
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,257
You're gonna be late.

16
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,718
- [Mike] He's a
pastor which means,

17
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:34,470
well it means all
kinds of things.

18
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,555
But right now it means
we're new to town.

19
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,850
It's not being in a new
town that bothers me.

20
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,227
I mean, it seems like New Hope

21
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,437
is a nice place and all,
but it's my senior year

22
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,022
in high school and who
wants to start over

23
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,398
during their senior year?

24
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,780
That's my mom.

25
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,698
- Hey, Boo Boo, what
are you thinking about?

26
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:55,825
- [Mike] She's
really a great mom,

27
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,660
but I hate it when
she calls me that.

28
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,954
- Mom, please,
don't call me that.

29
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,831
And I was thinking, it's stupid

30
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,082
to start school on a Friday.

31
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,501
I mean, why don't we
just wait until Monday?

32
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,879
- At least it makes for
a short school week.

33
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,465
- You know, actually, I
don't want to do this at all.

34
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,676
I want to go back to Lakewood.

35
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,135
- Honey, I know, but...

36
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,221
- Mom, this is my senior year.

37
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,764
- Mike, let's go.

38
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:21,809
Hey darling, bye bye.

39
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,813
Hey, he's going to be all right.

40
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,940
- I think it's time
that you give him

41
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,024
that fatherly advice
that you've been

42
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:29,900
talking about.

43
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,280
- Tonight.

44
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,781
I'm all over it.
- Okay.

45
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:36,866
- See ya tonight.

46
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,247
(sighs)

47
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,712
- Daddy, what does,
this sucks, mean?

48
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,882
- Put your seat belt on and
we'll discuss it later.

49
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,550
- But Mike said...

50
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,885
- Put your seat belt on and
we'll discuss it later.

51
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:57,928
- Meaner.

52
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,351
- Look, I know this
isn't how you envisioned

53
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,562
your senior year,
but this is where God

54
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,563
has us right now.

55
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,733
- Well he has my
permission to change it

56
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,775
whenever he's ready.

57
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,779
- Oh and remember,
Coach Miller agreed

58
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,531
to add you to the
basketball team.

59
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,450
We're meeting him at
three o'clock today.

60
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:21,869
- Great.

61
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,621
- Daddy, we're going to be late.

62
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,789
- All right, all right,
we're goin', we're goin'.

63
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,791

at three o'clock.

00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,078
Uh, Mike, three o'clock, right?

80
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,039
- Yeah, three o'clock, right.

81
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:11,543
- Come on, Dad.

82
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:12,378
We're gonna be late.

83
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,755
- All right, all
right, we're goin'.

84
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,884
(upbeat rock music)

85
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,637
See ya, Faith.

(gentle rock music)

87
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:48,080
(students chatter)

88
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,389
- Okay class, let's get started.

89
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,892
I would like to
first introduce you

90
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,894
to Michael Evans,
our new student.

91
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,062
- [Class] Hi, Michael.

92
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,357
- I would also
like to remind you

93
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:18,110
that next Friday, we will
have grief counselors

94
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,278
on campus.

95
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,946
And if you would like
to speak with one,

96
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,990
you will need to go
by the school office

97
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:23,824
and sign up.

98
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,453
- [Mike] The
counselors were there

99
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,830
because of the tragic
death of a student.

100
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,498
It was coming up on the
one year anniversary

101
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,959
of Chase taking his own life.

102
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:35,294
No one saw it coming
and it left a deep scar

103
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,962
on the entire community.

104
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,007
Especially the students.

105
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,345
- [Secretary Over
Intercom] Your 10 o'clock

106
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,138
appointment's here.

107
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,806
- You can send him in.

108
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,350
(gentle music)

109
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,066
Hi, come on in.

110
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,404
That's him over
there, Coach Miller.

111
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,697
- [Mike] I know, Dad.

112
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,115
- He's a great guy, you'll see.

113
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,784
He was on the committee
that brought me

114
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,618
here to New Hope.

115
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,079
- [Mike] Dad, you told
me like a hundred times.

116
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,206
- And that's Lucas
there, the big kid.

117
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,582
When Chase was on the
team they called them

118
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,792
the twin towers.

119
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,169
Hey, I want to introduce
you to the coach.

120
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,003
Hey coach!

121
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,088
Coach Miller!

122
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,883
- Hey, Brother Alex.

123
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,010
So this must be Michael.

124
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:26,970
Your dad's told me
a lot about you.

125
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,263
It sounds like you're
gonna be a great addition

126
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,848
to our team.

127
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,100
- Oh, he's a great player.

128
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,768
You'll see.

129
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,187
- Well, it looks like you
have everything in there.

130
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,022
Head onto the locker
room and get dressed.

131
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,363
(gentle music)

132
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,414
- Tom, I really appreciate
what you're doin'.

133
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,209
This move has been
pretty tough on Mike.

134
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,752
- Actually, you're doing
us a favor as well.

135
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,796
The loss of Chase
last year left a hole

136
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,048
in our lineup that we
haven't been able to fill.

137
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,926
We really need
another post player.

138
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,594
Especially with the
playoffs coming.

139
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,098
- So, how's the team
been handling it?

140
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,559
- About what you would expect.

141
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:17,187
Lucas is the one I'm
most concerned about.

142
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,815
I've been working
with kids for years.

143
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,608
But this is the
first time I've ever

144
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,443
had to deal with
something like this.

145
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,571
- I wonder if there's
something we could do to help.

146
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,030
I mean the church and all.

147
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:30,117
- Yeah, yeah, it sounds
like a great idea.

148
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,162
Hey, I better get back to it.

149
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,378
(whistle blows)

150
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,213
Hey, everybody in, everybody in.

151
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,387
Guys, this is Michael Evans.

152
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,306
He's new here in town.

153
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,559
And now, a part of this team.

154
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,271
All right, let's get
down to business.

155
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,190
Playoffs start next week.

156
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,399
And I'm not happy
with the amount

157
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,942
of turnovers we've been having

158
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,652
in the last few games.

159
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,779
If we want to win this thing,

160
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,907
that has to stop.

161
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,284
- Coach, you always say that.

162
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,161
- Green, mark my words.

163
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,163
Play like that in the playoffs

164
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,581
and it'll be a short trip.

165
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,167
All right, let's get
in our four on four

166
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,252
half court offense drills.

167
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,380
Give me Green, Hampton, Wallace.

168
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:29,051
Spence against
Richardson, Benson, Harris

169
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,427
and Evans.

170
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,431
Evans, play the
post against Green.

171
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,432
Okay, here we go.

172
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,103
Tyler, I need you to
really pressure Spence.

173
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,188
- Hey there, I'm Michael.

174
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,314
- Do us all a favor
and quit the team.

175
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,565
- [Coach] Force him
to pass the ball.

176
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:44,691
- Trust me, I don't
want to be here anymore

177
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:45,943
than you want me to be.

178
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,194
- [Coach] Now
let's get it goin'.

179
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,111
- Like I said,
quit the team now.

180
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,112
- Hey, you two love birds ready?

181
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,155
- Yeah, I got it.

182
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,531
- [Coach] Okay, here we go.

183
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,076
(whistle blows)

184
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,828
(dramatic music)

185
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,514
(whistle blows)

186
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,391
Green, what was that?

187
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,309
- What's your deal, man?

188
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,477
- What are you gonna
do about it, huh?

189
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,603
What are you gonna do?

190
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:22,396
- [Mike] You're crazy.

191
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,188
- Say it again.

192
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,231
I said say it again!

193
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,691
- Knock it off!

194
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:26,483
That's it, Green.

195
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,277
Head to the showers.

196
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,194
- This ain't over.

197
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,450
- Hey, everybody take five.

198
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,329
You okay?

199
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,915
- This was a bad idea.

200
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,167
- Lucas has had a
tough time lately.

201
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,252
I don't know if you know but...

202
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,336
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

203
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,090
- Yeah, well it's been
tough on all of us.

204
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:50,924
Especially Luke.

205
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,719
- No offense, Coach, but I just,

206
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,679
I really don't think
this is gonna work out.

207
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,764
- Whoa, hold on a sec.

208
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,224
This team needs you.

209
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,517
- Needs me?

210
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,935
I think my dad has
misled you about

211
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,687
my basketball skills.

212
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,981
- Mike, don't take
this the wrong way,

213
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,400
but when your dad
talked to me about you

214
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,485
joining the team, it
wasn't your basketball

215
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,903
skills that interested me.

216
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,283
These guys need a
positive role model.

217
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,659
Someone their age.

218
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,661
- [Mike] And that's
the biggest problem

219
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,288
with being a preacher's kid.

220
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,331
- Okay, I'm going
to go check on Luke.

221
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,291
- [Mike] It holds us to
a different standard.

222
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,209
Like we have all the answers.

223
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,046
Truth is, I have my struggles
just like all the rest.

224
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,673
Besides, I don't
even know these guys.

225
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:32,716
They're not going
to listen to me

226
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,092
even if I could help.

227
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,106
- I guess I shouldn't
ask how your first day

228
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,483
of school went today, huh?

229
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,237
Honey, I know this isn't easy...

230
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,698
- Mom, please, don't
give me the God's plan

231
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,075
speech, please.

232
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,534
- Trust in the Lord
with all your heart

233
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:00,577
and lean not...

234
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,287
- Honey, would you go and
get ready for supper, please.

235
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,373
- But I'm not done
with my homework yet.

236
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,666
- I know, but a short
break would be okay.

237
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,212
- Typical, conversation
gets good and you

238
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,755
send me to my room.

239
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,554
(Mike sighs)

240
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,349
- Hey, remember when
we moved last time?

241
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,434
And how much you hated
Lakewood at first?

242
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,353
And then after a while you said

243
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,480
it was the greatest
place on earth?

244
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,066
Give this place a chance.

245
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,442
- Mom, there's a big
difference between

246
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,820
the mountains of Lakewood
and the swamps of New Hope.

247
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,156
- I know this place is
different, but, you might be

248
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,449
surprised by it.

249
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,493
- Mom, it's not the
scenery and it's not even

250
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,452
the people.

251
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,704
Mom, it's my senior year.

252
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,748
And instead of being
able to enjoy it,

253
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,375
I'm having to learn to fit in.

254
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,754
- Wow, what a day!

255
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:55,173
You know, I'm really
starting to love it here.

256
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:01,721
What's up with him?

257
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,232
(knocking at door)

258
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,066
Hey.

259
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,582
I don't know how you
ever talked me into that.

260
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,086
I can honestly say
I have never been

261
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,504
more scared.

262
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,384
Rock climbing was never
on my bucket list.

263
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,722
- You didn't act scared.

264
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,808
- Yeah, well I'm pretty
good at hiding it

265
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:47,601
when I want to.

266
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:50,604
Like now.

267
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,068
Mike, you know life
is full of unexpected

268
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,236
twists and turns.

269
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,113
You have a choice.

270
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,784
We either face life's
issues or we turn from them.

271
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,414
- I just don't fit in here.

272
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:14,461
(gentle piano music)

273
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,047
(sighs)

274
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,382
- I didn't fit in on that rock.

275
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,345
I remember hanging on the
side of that cliff thinking,

276
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,931
what in the world
am I doing up here?

277
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,185
But, after we were finished,

278
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,270
and I survived,

279
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,400
it was one of the
greatest memories I have.

280
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,904
- This is different, Dad.

281
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:41,738
- Really?

282
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,199
Yeah, maybe.

283
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:51,456
But, I think after
all is said and done,

284
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,124
you might find this
might be the best

285
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,417
experience in your life.

286
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,550
All right, I'm going
to go check on supper.

287
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,260
Whatever your mom's cooking

288
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,094
sure smells good.

289
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,641
Hey Mike, I have faith in you.

290
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:14,145
(gentle piano music)

291
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,494
- Morning.

292
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,999
- You're up early.

293
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,584
- Yeah, I'm going exploring.

294
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,671
- Exploring, where?

295
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,798
- Mom, I'm 18 now,
I can handle it.

296
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,843
But I saw some
woods down the road,

297
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,595
it looks like a pretty
good place to explore.

298
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,430
Maybe take a few good pictures.

299
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,765
You're the one who said to
give this place a chance.

300
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,643
- Okay.

301
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,270
You have your
cellphone with you?

302
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,480
And do the words no trespassing

303
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,607
mean anything to you?

304
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,649
- I love you.

305
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,525
- A kiss please.

306
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:04,738
Be home by five.

307
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,953
(gentle music)

308
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,294
(camera shutter clicks)

309
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,258
- [Mike] I've always
loved the outdoors.

310
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,677
I could spend my entire
life hiking and exploring.

311
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,639
If only I could find
a way to make a living

312
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,723
doing it.

313
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,526
(Jasmine crying)

314
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,905
(gentle music)

315
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,762
- Are you okay?

316
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:13,973
- Who are you?

317
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:16,685
What are you doing here?

318
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:17,560
This is private property.

319
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,229
- I was just um...

320
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,400
I'll leave.

321
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,234
- Good idea.

322
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,489
Hey, wait.

323
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,663
Aren't you the new kid?

324
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,790
- Yeah, I'm Michael.

325
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,794
- You're that preacher's kid.

326
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:44,671
- Oh man.

327
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,756
Okay, I'm leaving.

328
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,176
- [Jasmine] Don't tell
anyone about this, okay?

329
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:51,845
- Tell 'em what?

330
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,099
- That you saw me like this.

331
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,521
- Your secret's
safe with me, so.

332
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,610
- I'm Jasmine.

333
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,695
- Michael.

334
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,323
- You said that already.

335
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,616
- Oh.
(laughs)

336
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,451
Oh yeah.

337
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,873
So I'm guessing
you own this land?

338
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,459
- Yeah.

339
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,043
Well, my parents do.

340
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,676
I just come out here
to think sometimes.

341
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,886
- I can see why.

342
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,013
You're lucky.

343
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:41,853
Boyfriend.

344
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:44,898
- Former.

345
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,025
- [Mike] What happened?

346
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,111
- He died.

347
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,783
(intense guitar music)

348
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,536
- Chase was your boyfriend.

349
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,791
Oh hey, I'm real sorry.

350
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:03,625
- No, it's okay.

351
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,798
- I should go.

352
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,258
- Yeah.

353
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,969
See you at school.

354
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,349
(gentle guitar music)

355
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,741
- Oh, we're done.

356
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,576
- Days get longer and longer.

357
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,494
(girls laugh)

358
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,913
- The longest day of my life.

359
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,045
- Jasmine, hey Jasmine.

360
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,923
- [Jasmine] Hey, I'll catch
up with you guys later, okay?

361
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,466
- [Girl] Okay, bye Jasmine.

362
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,926
- [Jasmine] Bye.

363
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,303
Hey.

364
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,096
- Hey.

365
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,851
- So, what's up?

366
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:03,893
- Oh, yeah, right.

367
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,062
I wanted to show
you these photos.

368
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,064
I took these back at your place

369
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:08,982
and, I don't know, I thought

370
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:09,941
you might wanna have 'em.

371
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,031
Wait, you took these?

372
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,741
- Yeah, but I mean,
you can keep them.

373
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,869
I mean, they're
yours anyways, right?

374
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:23,913
- Thanks.

375
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:28,585
Hey.

376
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,880
Do you think that
you could teach me

377
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,172
to take pictures like these?

378
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,050
- Yeah, sure, of course.

379
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,886
Yeah.

380
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,638
- All right well, meet
me out there later.

381
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,891
- Okay.
- Okay.

382
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,100
- Oh hey, it would
have to be after

383
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,518
basketball practice today.

384
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:47,604
- Okay.

385
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,605
Bye.

386
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,399
- Stupid basketball.

387
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:54,986
- No.

388
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,864
We didn't know it was coming.

389
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,911
I don't know what we
could've done differently.

390
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,956
And I'm his mother.

391
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,001
I should have seen something.

392
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,171
I should have noticed.

393
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,714
I should have been watching.

394
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,218
I should have recognized.

395
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,263
I should have talked to him.

396
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,848
- This is a normal day for her.

397
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:27,810
Crying, the guilt, despair.

398
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,062
Blaming herself.

399
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:30,897
By blaming me.

400
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,026
How long does this
have to go on?

401
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,571
- There's really no
timetable for grieving.

402
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,742
Process is different
for all of us.

403
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,748
- Seems your grieving
time is over.

404
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,168
- You think this is easy on me?

405
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,756
- You sure seem to
be handling it okay.

406
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,342
- I'm handling it in my way.

407
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,093
- If I might.

408
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:06,641
This might seem strange,
but what you're experiencing

409
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:07,475
is normal.

410
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,145
- I don't care about normal.

411
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,192
I care about my son
and I want him back.

412
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,406
- Don't forget, we
have another son.

413
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,200
And he needs his parents.

414
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,577
(sighs)

415
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,204
Sally, life goes on.

416
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,497
It's been a year.

417
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,082
- So what, we just
forget about Chase?

418
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,041
Is that what you're saying?

419
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,084
- I never said that.

420
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,131
We just can't grieve forever.

421
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:41,467
- I can.

422
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,513
(sighs)

423
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,347
- Well I can't.

424
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,269
Not and keep my sanity.

425
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,063
(sighs)

426
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,440
- Both of you have
every right to feel

427
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:56,232
the way you do.

428
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:00,862
(sighs)

429
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,113
I think it would be
helpful if you incorporated

430
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,823
some constructive
things in your lives.

431
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,951
- Like what?

432
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,872
- Well, continuing
this open dialogue.

433
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,166
Sharing your feelings.

434
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,169
Especially with each other.

435
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,506
I also think it would be helpful

436
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,425
if you were around other people

437
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,218
who have gone through
a similar experience.

438
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:26,971
Maybe a part of a support group.

439
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,099
You're both hurting.

440
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,061
It may look different,

441
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,897
but it's hurting, just the same.

442
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,906
- How long before
our old lives return?

443
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,663
- Honestly, John, never.

444
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,044
But there is a
peace to be found.

445
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,055
- [Lucas] The party and
like I'm ready to leave,

446
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,057
people are leaving and
things are winding down,

447
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,225
so I'm trying to find an exit.

448
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,644
But I go upstairs and
this girls following me.

449
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,105
I actually go in the
bedroom, she's knocking

450
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,314
on the door, I'm
not lettin' her in.

451
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,649
There's not an exit...

452
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,451
I thought you quit, man.

453
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,579
- I never said that.

454
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:36,124
- Well, you should've.

455
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,626
- Look man, I don't
want any trouble.

456
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,129
- Well you're fixin' to get it.

457
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,091
Look, hey, if you think
you're gonna come in here

458
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:49,637
and replace Chase, you've
lost your freaking mind.

459
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,180
- I'm not trying to replace
anyone, okay, I'm just...

460
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,390
- You just what, huh?

461
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:53,516
Huh?

462
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,810
You gonna save us all?

463
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,187
- Green, Evans.

464
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,149
What's going on?

465
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,650
- Nothing coach.

466
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,153
We were just talking basketball.

467
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,487
You know it's a
physical game, right?

468
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:07,947
- Okay, listen to me.

469
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,282
All of you listen to me.

470
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,075
We don't have time
for all of this.

471
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,910
We play Highland tomorrow night.

472
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,370
And if we don't get focused,

473
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,998
the playoffs are
gonna be over quick.

474
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,083
- Coach, we can beat Highland.

475
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,252
Even if the angel
here is playing.

476
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,211
- Enough!

477
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,130
We have work to do.

478
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,465
Everybody take to court.

479
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:31,179
(gentle somber music)

480
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,105
- Hey kid.

481
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:43,900
Hang tough.

482
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:48,279
(gentle somber music)

483
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,011
Okay, everybody in.

484
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:12,845
Everybody in.

485
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,270
Let me have your attention.

486
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,188
Being a part of this team

487
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,273
is more than just basketball,

488
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,567
practice and workouts.

489
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:29,028
It's about having character.

490
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,155
And gettin' your grades.

491
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:33,866
I just got word.

492
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,702
Wallace, you're
academically ineligible

493
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,120
against Highland.

494
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,163
Head to the locker room.

495
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,209
Hey.

496
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,252
Get your grades up.

497
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,463
We may be able to get
you back I this thing.

498
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,472
All right, guys.

499
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,599
We're one man down.

500
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,311
I've got faith in you guys.

501
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,146
We can pull together.

502
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,981
We're a team.

503
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,276
All right.

504
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,069
Our scouting reports
say Highland is soft

505
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,279
on the post.

506
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,905
So that'll be our focus.

507
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:15,616
That's where our points
are going to come from.

508
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,450
Okay.

509
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,036
(whistle blows)

510
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,329
All right, you know the drill.

511
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,294
Hey.

512
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,336
Keep it clean, boys.

513
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,588
Play hard, no fouls.

514
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,259
All right.

515
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,137
(whistle blows)

516
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,764
(intense music)

517
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,434
- Come on, ball.

518
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,146
Ball.

519
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,735
- [Coach] Nice, nice, very nice.

520
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:51,527
- You can't hold me.

521
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,320
Not today, not ever.

522
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:53,362
- Okay, turn it around.

523
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,905
Offense goes to defense.

524
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,207
That's the way Green!

525
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,667
Good job, Mike, good job.

526
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,336
Turn around.

527
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:13,674
- [Lucas] Ball, ball.

528
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:16,719
Ball, ball, ball.

529
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,263
(upbeat music)

530
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,516
(groans)

531
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,228
- I'm not scared of you!

532
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,730
Then you're soft and stupid.

533
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,398
And you better stay
away from Jasmine!

534
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:30,191
- What?

535
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,108
- You heard me.

536
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,401
I said stay away from her.

537
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:33,652
- You can't tell me
who to hang out with.

538
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:34,445
- What did you say?

539
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,237
Say it again.

540
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,405
- Enough!

541
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,657
If you two have so much energy,

542
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,034
let's run a few gassers.

543
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,869
Everyone on the line.

544
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,496
Green that way, Evans that way.

545
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,708
On my whistle.

546
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:52,213
(upbeat music)

547
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,840
(whistle blows)

548
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:05,851
- I was beginning to wonder.

549
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,728
- Yeah, practice
ran a little longer

550
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:08,896
than I expected.

551
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,316
- So, did you bring your camera?

552
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:14,402
- Oh.

553
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,531
I had a feeling I was
forgetting something.

554
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,366
I can bring it another day.

555
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,159
- It's just as well.

556
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:24,620
I'm not in the mood.

557
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,541
(gentle music)

558
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,003
- Hey, can I ask you a question?

559
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,713
How did you get your name?

560
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,215
- Jasmine?
- Yeah.

561
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,508
- My dad.

562
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,261
It's his favorite flower.

563
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,139
Before long this whole
place is going to be

564
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,140
blooming with them.

565
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,350
It just grows wild.

566
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,437
Kind of like me, I guess.

567
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,189
- Yeah, I'd like to see that.

568
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:55,192
The flowers, I mean, not you.

569
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,319
(laughs)

570
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,495
Is it okay if I ask about him?

571
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,293
How long had you been dating?

572
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,506
- We were an item
since grade school.

573
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,552
I really can't remember a time

574
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,678
when we weren't together.

575
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,098
He was my hero.

576
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,560
- [Mike] What happened?

577
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:35,441
- I've asked myself
that a million times.

578
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:39,028
He just started shutting me out.

579
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,782
I should have done something.

580
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:50,122
- Blaming yourself won't
change what happened.

581
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:55,294
There was a kid back
in my junior high,

582
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,171
that committed suicide.

583
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:03,219
And I kept asking
myself, what I could have

584
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,261
done differently.

585
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,431
You know, maybe just
talk to him more

586
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,975
or just be his
friend, I don't know.

587
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,395
You know, I had lots of guilt.

588
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,900
But then I finally
realized that, hey,

589
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,193
it's not my fault.

590
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,656
- What changed?

591
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,996
- For me it was God.

592
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,830
- God?

593
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,792
Now you sound like the preacher

594
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:35,668
at his funeral.

595
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,714
Besides, I've tried
all that God stuff.

596
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:44,093
Until I found out
how flawed it was.

597
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,138
- It's not Christianity
that's flawed.

598
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,392
It's the Christians.

599
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,852
(gentle music)

600
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,438
I mean, we all have struggles.

601
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,483
But God hasn't given up on you.

602
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,078
- Where do you get
all this stuff?

603
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:15,332
- Well I'm a preachers
kid, what do you expect?

604
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,669
- Well, I doubt God
would want anything to do

605
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,421
with some troubled
high school kid.

606
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,465
- I don't know.

607
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:28,012
You might be surprised.

608
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,347
It's funny what we believe
about ourselves and God.

609
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,641
Regardless of how many
times we hear about

610
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:35,561
God loving us, it just
doesn't really sink in.

611
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:41,817
- [Cheerleaders] Give me
a G to the O, go, go, go.

612
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,529
Give me a G to
the O, go, go, go.

613
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,408
- Okay guys.

614
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,535
All of your hard work has
led up to this moment.

615
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:52,995
This game.

616
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,955
This is your moment.

617
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,498
This is your gym.

618
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:57,416
This is your game.

619
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,545
And let's show them how
we do it in our house.

620
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:02,755
Tigers on three.

621
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:04,798
One, two, three.

622
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:05,799
- [All] Tigers.

623
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,676
(upbeat music)

624
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,055
(attendees applaud and cheer)

625
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:14,141
- [Cheerleaders]
Let's go, Tigers.

626
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,726
Let's go, Tigers.

627
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,354
Let's go, Tigers.

628
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,690
Let's go, Tigers.

629
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,611
(upbeat music)

630
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,615
(crowd cheers)

631
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,408
Let's go, Tigers.

632
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:33,952
(upbeat music)

633
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:38,749
- [Coach] Good job.

634
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,167
Luke!

635
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,252
(upbeat music)

636
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:45,047
(crowd cheers)

637
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,299
Hands up, hands up!

638
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:49,718
- Tony, great job, great job.

639
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,720
Keep up, keep up.

640
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,515
(crowd cheers)

641
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,975
(upbeat music)

642
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,321
Swing the ball, swing the ball.

643
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:11,824
(upbeat music)

644
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:20,040
(crowd cheers)

645
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:22,793
(upbeat music)

646
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,427
(crowd cheers)

647
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:35,389
(upbeat music)

648
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,358
Great job, great job.

649
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:49,361
(upbeat music)

650
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:51,697
- Shoot the breeze,
shoot the breeze.

651
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,866
- Let's go now, come on.

652
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,618
(crowd cheers)

653
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,121
(upbeat music)

654
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:07,629
- There we go, yes, yes.

655
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:08,714
Yes, yes.

656
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,176
Go, go, go.

657
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,720
(upbeat music)

658
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:20,684
(coach applauds)

659
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,074
(crowd cheers)

660
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,326
Good, good.

661
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,369
- Now off rebound, be prepared.

662
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,914
(upbeat music)

663
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,126
(whistle blows)

664
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,879
(upbeat music)

665
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,434
- [Mike] Love him or hate
him, you have to admit

666
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,645
that Lucas could
play basketball.

667
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,730
I guess it's really
all he has in life.

668
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:07,815
It's where he's fulfilled,

669
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,691
where he can let it all out.

670
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,652
But on this night too
much of his emotion

671
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,028
was pouring out.

672
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,364
Maybe it was the death of Chase,

673
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,699
maybe it was just
Lucas being Lucas.

674
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:18,742
(whistle blows)

675
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:19,868
- Foul!

676
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:20,828
- Come on, you saw that.

677
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:21,870
He's flopping.

678
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:22,663
- 10.

679
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:23,455
Fine, Wayne.

680
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,791
(groans)

681
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:26,959
- Green, what are you doing?

682
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,085
You're going to get
kicked out of this game.

683
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:28,877
- I didn't touch the guy.

684
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:29,795
The ref's an idiot.

685
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,088
- Yeah, and you have four fouls.

686
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,840
You're on the bench.

687
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,843
Benson remember, you
have four fouls, too.

688
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,928
No more fouls.

689
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:39,805
Evans, you're in.

690
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,765
- Are you serious?

691
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,141
Coach, he'll cost us the game.

692
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:44,393
- Did you hear me?

693
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,519
You're in.

694
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,938
- I'm going in for five.

695
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,191
- Okay guys, keep
your composure.

696
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:53,068
We've got to get this win.

697
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,196
We're in total
control of this game.

698
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,989
Mike.

699
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,950
Give me a few good
minutes until Lucas

700
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,869
can regain his composure.

701
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:02,870
Okay, here we go.

702
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,497
Tigers on three.

703
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:06,874
One, two, three.

704
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:07,958
- [All] Tigers.

705
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:12,629
(crowd cheers)

706
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,968
- [Cheerleaders]
Defense, Tigers, defense.

707
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,887
Defense, Tigers, defense.

708
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,806
Defense, Tigers, defense.

709
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:34,610
- No, you guys know
better than that.

710
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:35,944
- Rebound, come on.

711
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:38,614
- [Coach Miller] Down, Spence.

712
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:46,955
(crowd cheers)

713
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,761
(mellow music)

714
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:13,482
- I told you.

715
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,122
- Inside, down low,
down low, down low.

716
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,505
Good shot, Tony,
good shot, Tony.

717
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:37,339
Great job.

718
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,173
Great job.

719
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:51,395
There we go.

720
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,980
- Line, line, line.

721
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,816
(crowd cheers)

722
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,025
- Hey, no fouls.

723
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,074
Come on, make smart passes,

724
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,283
make smart passes.

725
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:08,662
Smart passes.

726
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:12,958
(whistle blows)

727
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,084
- [Referee] 20.

728
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:14,960
Push.

729
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,671
- You've got to be kidding me.

730
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,297
All right, Evans,
you're back in.

731
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,968
(intense music)

732
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:05,010
(cheerleaders chatter)

733
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,178
- Ref, time out!

734
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:09,056
(whistle blows)

735
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,144
All right guys,
they're gonna try

736
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,188
and trap to cause a turnover.

737
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,565
We've practiced this
a thousand times.

738
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,150
Make smart passes.

739
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:23,028
If we can run the clock,
they will be forced to foul.

740
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,280
- Put somebody else in the game.

741
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,531
- What?

742
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:27,699
- I said put somebody
else in the game.

743
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,035
- Green, I'll coach, you play.

744
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:35,332
Now make smart plays
and watch your passes.

745
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:38,043
All right, Tigers on three.

746
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,294
One, two, three.

747
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,128
- [All] Tigers.

748
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,130
- [Cheerleaders] Hands up.

749
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,423
Keep them hands up, hands up.

750
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:45,050
Keep them hands up, hands up.

751
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,594
Keep them hands up, hands up.

752
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,222
- Come on, Lucas.

753
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,182
Lucas, down low.

754
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,642
- Time out, time out.

755
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,811
(whistle blows)

756
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:56,645
What was that?

757
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,564
God.

758
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,149
- They're losing
their composure.

759
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,317
Now we gotta keep on 'em, guys.

760
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,318
Stay in the game.

761
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,694
- You know we're
out of timeouts.

762
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:07,239
Lucas, pass the ball.

763
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,491
Mike was wide open.

764
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,034
Mike, you get the ball...

765
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,869
- I'm not passing the ball.

766
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:13,995
- You'll do as I say
or I'll put your butt

767
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,456
on the bench, got that?

768
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,583
We worked too hard to
let this slip away.

769
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,003
Let's go out there
and get this win.

770
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,672
Tigers on three.

771
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,382
One, two, three.

772
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,216
- [All] Tigers.

773
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:28,593
(dramatic music)

774
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:29,427
- Come on.

775
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,056
- Now all we got
to do is put 'em in

776
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,099
the same situation.

777
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,142
Let's go.

778
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:38,228
(cheerleaders chatter)

779
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,063
(whistle blows)

780
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:43,024
(dramatic music)

781
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,737
- One, two, three, four.
- Lucas!

782
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,242
(whistle blows)

783
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:55,662
- Hold, hold, three,
four, Green, push.

784
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,248
(intense music)

785
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,517
- Push the ball, push it.

786
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:18,727
Get it up to him.

787
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,150
Boom, that's the way to finish.

788
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,401
That's what I'm
talking about, Tony.

789
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:35,785
Balls out, balls out, yes.

790
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,412
Free ball, let's go.

791
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:48,840
Let's go, let's go.

792
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:49,841
Eagle, eagle, eagle, eagle,

793
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:50,926
eagle, eagle.

794
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,595
(dramatic music)

795
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:09,527
(buzzer sounds)

796
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,280
(crowd cheers)

797
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,056
- [Mike] Yeah, love
him or hate him,

798
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,100
you have to admit that
he can play basketball.

799
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,061
And everybody loves a winner.

800
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,073
- Sweetheart, why
don't you go ahead

801
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,324
and get ready for bed
and I'll be in there

802
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:57,367
in just a minute.

803
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,870
- One day you'll realize
the contributions

804
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:03,164
I can make to the
parenting discussions.

805
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,425
- Hey, I think we need to talk.

806
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:18,763
I'm having a really hard
time watching our son

807
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:21,308
be embarrassed on
the basketball court

808
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,101
in front of everyone.

809
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,603
And please, don't give me
that building character

810
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,314
sermon again.

811
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:30,317
- Quitting the team is not
"building character" either.

812
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,193
Liv, this is not as
bad as you think.

813
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,903
- Try telling that to
a 18 year-old who's

814
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:34,988
trying to fit in.

815
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,825
(Alex sighs)

816
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,368
- I hear what you're sayin'.

817
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,998
But I just know this
is gonna get better.

818
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:46,791
Trust me.

819
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,213
- This isn't a matter of trust.

820
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,257
This is about the damage
that is being done

821
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:56,301
to our son's confidence.

822
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,636
- [Faith] Mom!

823
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,264
- Honey, I'll be
right there, okay?

824
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:07,937
I think you need to
think this through.

825
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,904
- Okay.
- Okay.

826
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:27,665
- [Alex] Hey, Mike.

827
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:34,964
Great game tonight.

828
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:38,301
- Seriously?

829
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,054
Great game?

830
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:44,224
I almost cost us the playoffs.

831
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,394
- I don't know if
I would say that.

832
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:49,396
You scored four points.

833
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,189
You had some big minutes.

834
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,857
- Be real, Dad.

835
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,609
It was horrible.

836
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,820
I was horrible.

837
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,448
How am I supposed
to face those guys?

838
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,286
- I know it's hard
to believe but,

839
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,287
you're going to
look back on this

840
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:07,664
so differently.

841
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,499
- You keep saying that, Dad.

842
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,462
- I remember when I was your age

843
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:16,256
trying to figure out
why this thing happened

844
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,465
or that thing happened.

845
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:19,509
It's frustrating.

846
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,720
But I also remember
somebody shared with me

847
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,515
something about how
God works in our life.

848
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:29,477
He said it's a lot like
driving a car at night.

849
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,354
You know, you only
get enough light

850
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:33,314
for the road right
in front of you.

851
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:37,110
But it's enough light
to keep you safe.

852
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,530
And hopefully keep
you out of a ditch.

853
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,367
- And what do headlights
have to do with basketball?

854
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:45,827
- I don't know what the
Lord's trying to teach you

855
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,622
right now, but I
do know that he is.

856
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,501
And I also know that
if you will trust him,

857
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,464
he is gonna guide
you through this.

858
00:45:57,547 --> 00:46:00,508
Even if it seems like
you're lost in the dark.

859
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:03,720
(Mike scoffs)

860
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:06,222
- Well we both can agree
that I'm in the dark.

861
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,601
- Mike, you've got to
remember that it's Satan

862
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:12,103
whispering those
lies in your head.

863
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:13,438
You lose all perspective.

864
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:18,902
For instance, what if
you had fouled that guy

865
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,153
at the end of the game?

866
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,947
He goes on to make
two free throws.

867
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:24,866
You guys lose.

868
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:31,039
On the other hand,
the way you played it,

869
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,583
you allowed Lucas
to make the play.

870
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,087
It's a team game, Mike.

871
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:45,470
So I say we celebrate
with one of your dad's

872
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,055
award-winning malts.

873
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:49,265
Why don't you get
the blender out

874
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:50,391
of the cabinet.

875
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:53,561
(gentle piano music)

876
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:06,533
- [Mike] I think it
was then that I really

877
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,451
appreciated my dad
for who he was.

878
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:10,703
Thanks, Dad.

879
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,208
- Hey, I'm a preacher.

880
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,501
This God stuff's all I know.

881
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:21,297
Now where does your
Mom keep those scoops?

882
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,049
- I think over there.

883
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:32,850
♪ Close our eyes ♪

884
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:35,937
♪ I see you smile
and then I knew ♪

885
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,689
- Hey Mom, I'm going
back out to those woods.

886
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:38,940
I'll be back soon.

887
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,485
- That's fine, just
be home by six,

888
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:44,654
we're having company for dinner.

889
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:45,613
(Mike sighs)

890
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,115
- [Mike] Can I
just skip this one?

891
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,324
- No, sweetheart,
it's some people

892
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:49,617
from the church that your dad's

893
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:50,868
been counseling, and
I really want you

894
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,203
to meet them.

895
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:53,496
- All right.

896
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,665
Hey, can I invite a friend?

897
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,626
- Maybe not this time.

898
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,711
- Come on, Mom.

899
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:00,837
I don't want to be
there with all these

900
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,671
old people and be bored.

901
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,757
- That's fine,
just don't be late.

902
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:06,301
- Okay.
- Love you.

903
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:07,844
- Love you.

904
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:09,846
♪ And I'll keep moving on ♪

905
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,139

(gentle guitar music)

911
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,582
- Hey, where are you goin'?

912
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:38,750
- What are you doin'?

913
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,753

914
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,714

915
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:45,506
- Mine.

916
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,133
No, just my dad's.

917
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,218
- Need some help with that?

918
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:50,637
It looks like you're
having a little bit

919
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,431

(Mike chuckles)

921
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,518
- Hey, I remembered
my camera this time.

922
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:58,895
- [Jasmine] Cool.

923
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,688
I always knew I was a star.
- Oh yeah.

924
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:02,106
Oh yeah, for sure.

925
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:04,651
Look at that.

926
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,739
Give me more fierce, if you can.

927
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,991
Okay, okay.

928
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,452
Give me sassy, I bet you can't.

929
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,873
Like, give me one of these.

930
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:22,210
(gentle piano music)

931
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,044
I like it.

932
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,922
- Okay, come on, come on.

933
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:27,173
- Really?

934
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,675
- Get in the boat.

935
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:30,051
- Okay.

936
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,469
- [Jasmine] That
is, if you think

937
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:32,470
you can handle it.

938
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:33,554
- I can handle it.

939
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:35,014
- [Jasmine] All right,
be careful, Colorado.

940
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:37,517
(Mike chuckles)

941
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:40,728
Paddle?

942
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:42,021
- [Mike] Yeah.

943
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:43,022
Of course.
- Try it out?

944
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:45,358
- All right, let's see this.

945
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:46,567
- If you get in a
bind, I can help out.

946

947
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,200

948
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:57,286

what would you be?

- Huh?

966
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:09,484
- You know, what animal?

967
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,028
Like would you be
a horse or a lion?

968
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:13,863
- Um.

969
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:17,867
I think a cheetah.

970
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:20,953
I don't know.

971
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:23,539
What about you?

972
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:24,665
- Easy.

973
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,417
An eagle.

974
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:29,420
A majestic bald eagle.

975
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:32,256
That way I could just
soar over everything.

976
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:35,593
No one could touch me
unless I wanted them to.

977
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,306
- Do eagles like cheetahs?

978
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:42,725
- I sure hope so.

979
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,607
- Oh no, what time is it?

980
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:54,779
- 4:30.
- Oh.

981
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,405
- Why?

982
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:58,199
- I have to hurry
home and get ready.

983
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,159
Oh, by the way, I told my mom

984
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:01,911
you were coming over for dinner.

985
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:02,912
- [Jasmine] Your mom?

986
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:03,955
Shouldn't you have
told me first?

987
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:08,376
- Yeah, yeah, that
probably would have been

988
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:09,710
a good idea.

989
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:11,963
But, all right, I'll
pick you up at six,

990
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,923
so you have to hurry
up and get ready.

991
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,842
- Aren't you forgetting
something else?

992
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:18,135
My parents.

993
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:20,763
- Right, that might
be a good idea.

994
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:23,891
Um, okay, I'll be at
your house at six,

995
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:26,060
to pick you up and
meet your parents.

996
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,187
- [Jasmine] You
sure you have time?

997
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:30,898
- Hey, I'm a cheetah.

998
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:33,442
(upbeat music)

999
00:52:53,296 --> 00:52:54,046
Um.

1000
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,343
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Stone.

1001
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:00,636
I'm Michael Evans.

1002
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,346
Even though you probably never

1003
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,681
heard my name.

1004
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,641
I'm here to take your daughter,

1005
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:07,977
you know, just to go
eat with my family

1006
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,770
over at my house.

1007
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,522
Hm?

1008
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:12,648
(chuckles)

1009
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:14,650
Oh yes, you can trust me.

1010
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:17,153
Well my dad's a preacher.

1011
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,114
(sighs)

1012
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:20,907
Yeah, that's good, Mike.

1013
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:21,991
Real impressive.

1014
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,996
(tapping on window)

1015
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,500
- Who do you think you are?

1016
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,170
- Sir?

1017
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,212
- Are you that
young kid speeding

1018
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:37,173
up and down the street?

1019
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,884
- Um, no sir, no.

1020
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,011
- And throwing beer
cans everywhere.

1021
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:43,888
- No, sir.

1022
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,598
- Well I want you to know

1023
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,975
I've got my eye on you.

1024
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:50,061
You just keep that
in mind, young man.

1025
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,856
Young people, I
declare, something else.

1026
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:56,776

- Hey.

1031
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:07,995
- Come on in.

1032
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:08,955
- [Mike] Thank you.

1033
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:15,670
- So, this is it.

1034
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:16,504
- Wow.

1035
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:19,840
(both chuckle)

1036
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,926

Mom, dad.

1039
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:34,855
This is Michael.

1040
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,357
- Hey, Michael.

1041
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,025
Jas said you were new in town.

1042
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:39,568
- Yes, ma'am.

1043
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:40,778
We just moved here.

1044
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:41,862
- [Mrs. Stone] Where from?

1045
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,781
- Well, we've kind
of lived all over,

1046
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:46,534
but we just moved
in from Colorado.

1047
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,160
- Colorado, wow.

1048
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:49,996
I bet that was a bit
of a culture shock.

1049
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,540
- Well, the altitude
sure is different,

1050
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:53,749
yes, ma'am.

1051
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,084
(Mike laughs)

1052
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,794
- Well, welcome to New Hope.

1053
00:54:56,877 --> 00:55:00,047
Or as I like to call it, Nope.

1054
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:01,966
Come on, let's get going.

1055
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:03,259
We're going to be late.

1056
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:04,969
- Well, nice to
meet you, Michael.

1057
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,888
Jas, be in by 12.
- We're going to be late.

1058
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,432
- Okay, okay.

1059
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:13,060
12 o'clock, no later.

1060
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:14,478
- Okay, got it.

1061
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:16,814
(Mike sighs)

1062
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,316
- That went a lot better
than I was expecting.

1063
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,526
(Jasmine laughs)

1064
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:22,319
- Yeah, I mean, my
parents are pretty cool.

1065
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:24,780
They usually just let
me do whatever I want.

1066
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:27,408
- Oh, speaking of parents,
mine are expecting us,

1067
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,660
so, we should
probably head on over.

1068
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,247
(gentle music)

1069
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,584
- Hey, I have an idea.

1070
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:39,628
I mean, we have this
whole house to ourselves.

1071
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:41,297
Let's just stay here.

1072
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:46,010
- That's not a good idea.

1073
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,262
My mom would not
be a happy camper.

1074
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:52,266
- Don't be such a square.

1075
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,353
I mean besides, don't
your parents trust you?

1076
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:57,730
- Jasmine.

1077
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:00,024
That's exactly it, they do.

1078
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,109
I mean, doing
something like this

1079
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:03,819
would make me lose their trust.

1080
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:06,822
- Square.

1081
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,157
- Come on, I met your parents.

1082
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,241
You get to meet mine.

1083
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:10,034
(Jasmine sighs)

1084
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,118
- Fine, okay.

1085
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,958
- Hey honey, try not to
ask too many questions.

1086
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,877
Let the adults do
most of the talking.

1087
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,462
- Mom, don't take
this the wrong way,

1088
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,507
but have you heard how
boring you and Dad are?

1089
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,424
(laughs)

1090
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:27,718
- Well we'll do the best we can.

1091
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:28,928
Michael is bringing a friend

1092
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:31,138
so be nice to her as well.

1093
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,973
- Mike has a girlfriend?

1094
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:34,308
- I said a friend.

1095
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,768
- But then you said her.

1096
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,062
- But before that I
said, be nice, remember?

1097
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,146
- Yes, ma'am.

1098
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,024
- Now finish help
setting the table.

1099
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,861
- Michael's got a girlfriend.

1100
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:47,446
Michael's got a girlfriend.

1101
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,740
- This girlfriend have a name?

1102
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:52,076
- Not yet, but she
must be angelic,

1103
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,953
by the way he's acting.

1104
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:55,412
- Obviously it's Olivia.

1105
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:57,206
(Olivia laughs)

1106
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,333
- Flattery will
get you everywhere.

1107
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,918
- Hey, I wonder how much
time we have before...

1108
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,044
(doorbell rings)

1109
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:03,504
- [Faith] They're here.

1110
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:04,421
- Let your daddy get it.

1111
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:05,756
Remember what we said.

1112
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,346
- John and Sally, come on in.

1113
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,264
- Hey.

1114
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,306
- Good to see ya.
- You, too.

1115
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:15,224
- Good to see ya.

1116
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:16,392
- This is my wife, Olivia.

1117
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:17,810
- So nice to meet you.

1118
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,186
- [Alex] And our
daughter, Faith.

1119
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,688
- [John] Hey, nice to meet you.

1120
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,148
This is our son, Lucas.

1121
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:24,108
- [Mike] Hello, Lucas.

1122
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,110
Your dad's told me
a lot about you.

1123
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:28,529
(timer beeps)

1124
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:29,905
- That's my roast.

1125
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:31,740
I'm going to go
get it, excuse me.

1126
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:34,577
- Well, is there anything
I can help you do?

1127
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,328
- [Faith] I'm coming, too.

1128
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:38,539
- So Lucas, that
was quite a game

1129
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,499
you played the other night.

1130
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:41,834
Hey, and your dad says
you've been getting

1131
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,128
some offers to
play college ball.

1132
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,254
It's pretty exciting.

1133
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:50,301
- Yeah, but I haven't decided
what I'm going to do yet.

1134
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,428
- Well, I'd love to
hear more about it.

1135
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:53,971
Let's go in the living room.

1136
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:02,813
- Whoa, whoa, what is this?

1137
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:05,274
Is this some kind of sick joke?

1138
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:08,777
- What are you talking about?

1139
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,238
- Just take me home.

1140
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:12,156
- What's the matter?

1141
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,240
I thought you were all excited.

1142
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:16,577
- That looks like
Chases parents car.

1143
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,830
- Look, I didn't know
anything about this.

1144
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,707
Mom just said we
were having company.

1145
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,295
- Okay, I know this
is hard for you,

1146
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,088
but I don't want to
go in there alone.

1147
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:30,090
- Okay then, let's just both go.

1148
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,635
- I can't, you know that.

1149
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:38,766
Please.

1150
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:48,192
(Jasmine sighs)

1151
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,026
- Fine.

1152
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:02,623
- Oh, just put that there.

1153
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:03,916
Thank you.

1154
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,251
Just let it cool
off a little bit.

1155
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:07,002
- Hey mom, this is Jasmine.

1156
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:13,926
- Jasmine, nice to meet you.

1157
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,053
- Nice to meet you,
too, Mrs. Evans.

1158
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:20,099
- It's nice to see ya', Jas.

1159
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,601
- You two know each other?

1160
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:27,273
- Yeah, we've known
each other for years.

1161
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:29,275
She was...

1162
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,070
She was Chase's girlfriend.

1163
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,824
- Oh, I had no idea.

1164
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:40,828
This is my first
time meeting Jasmine.

1165
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,371
- It's okay, Olivia.

1166
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:45,416
It's really good
to see ya', Jas.

1167
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:48,210
- It's good to see you, too.

1168
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:53,048
- Michael, have you introduced
her to your father yet?

1169
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,467
- No, not yet.

1170
00:59:57,386 --> 00:59:59,805
- Well, for goodness
sakes, Jasmine.

1171
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:01,265
Come and meet Michael's father.

1172
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,108
In-state, maybe
out-of-state schools.

1173
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,360
(mumbles)

1174
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:17,364
- [Olivia] Alex, this is
Jasmine, Michael's friend.

1175
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:19,325
- Hi, Jasmine, nice to meet you.

1176
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:20,367
- Nice to meet you, too.

1177
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:22,369
- Hey, Jas.

1178
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:24,872
What are you doing here?

1179
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,418
- Michael invited me to supper.

1180
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,132
- I think the food is ready.

1181
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:36,592
Why don't we go
into the dining room

1182
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:37,968
and get ready for dinner?

1183
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,320
- [Alex] Uh, Faith, honey.

1184
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,072
Wouldn't you be more
comfortable over here?

1185
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,698
- No, I think this
is a good spot.

1186
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:02,910
- Sweetheart, why don't
you come sit by me.

1187
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:24,473
- Well, this sure smells good.

1188
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:26,600
Lucas, you're really
going to enjoy

1189
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,643
Olivia's roast.

1190
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:31,313
(intense music)

1191
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,608
- He'll eat just about anything.

1192
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,901
Isn't that right, honey?

1193
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:41,323
- Luke, did you
hear your mother?

1194
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,411
- What's wrong with you people?

1195
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,754
Did you think I was
just gonna walk in here,

1196
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:57,673
hold hands and have a
prayer with the pastor?

1197
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:58,674
Was that the plan?

1198
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,175
- Lucas, sit down.

1199
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:01,260
- Or what, dad?

1200
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:03,846
You gonna send me to my room?

1201
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,222
- You're upsetting your mother,

1202
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:06,557
everyone here at the table.

1203
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,183
- Like I freaking care.

1204
01:02:08,267 --> 01:02:10,394
these people invite me in,
sit me across the table

1205
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:11,186
from that joke.

1206
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:15,566
And you, look at me.

1207
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:18,402
What are you thinking?

1208
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:19,194
Really, Jas.

1209
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:21,864
What are any of you thinking?

1210
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:25,617
These bunch of holier
than thou Jesus freaks

1211
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:27,411
think they have all the answers.

1212
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:30,330
- Lucas Green, that's enough.

1213
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:32,708
- No, dad, it's not enough.

1214
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:34,835
Chase was enough.

1215
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:38,505
- Lucas.

1216
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:39,548
- No, I'll walk home.

1217
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:41,091
- Lucas, come back here.

1218
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:42,968
- Sally, let him go.

1219
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:48,515
I'm sorry.

1220
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,400
- He's a meaner.

1221
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:05,574
- Look, I'm sorry.

1222
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:12,331
- Hey, I mean, it's just
Lucas blowing off steam.

1223
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:14,541
You get used to it.

1224
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:19,463
- That might take a while.

1225
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:25,093
- You know, the
funny thing is, Chase

1226
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:26,553
was nothing like that.

1227
01:03:29,223 --> 01:03:30,599
I think that's one reason Lucas'

1228
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:32,392
life is so out of
balance, you know?

1229
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,606
Chase was always the cool one.

1230
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,484
Kind of like you.

1231
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,698
- Us cheetahs are
cool like that.

1232
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:53,038
Hey, before you take me home,

1233
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:56,041
I know a great place to go.

1234
01:03:57,918 --> 01:03:58,961
- Cool, where?

1235
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,630
- You'll just have to trust me.

1236
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:08,720
Turn here.

1237
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:12,140
- And here I thought
you were gonna

1238
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:14,101
take me out malt or something.

1239
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,521
- Remember when you
asked me to trust you?

1240
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:22,776
Now, it's your turn.

1241
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:26,905
- Okay, all right.

1242
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:30,617
The funny thing about trust,

1243
01:04:30,701 --> 01:04:32,494
it's hard to earn
and easy to lose.

1244
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:39,501
(gentle music)

1245
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:47,801
- [Jasmine] Just
park right here.

1246
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:53,515
- [Mike] What's this?

1247
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,309
- [Jasmine] It's a party, silly.

1248
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,519
- I can see that, but...

1249
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:00,147
- It's just some
kids from school.

1250
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,107
They do this every weekend.

1251
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:07,487
- This isn't a good idea.

1252
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:08,488
My dad, he...

1253
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:09,615
- Your dad what?

1254
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:10,574
He wouldn't want you hanging out

1255
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:12,034
with all these sinners?

1256
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,661
- That's not what I'm saying.

1257
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:15,746
- Hey, I've found
them a lot more

1258
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:16,997
comfortable with these people

1259
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,041
than most of those
hypocrites at church.

1260
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:24,880
Besides, don't be a square.

1261
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,718
(gentle music)

1262
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,861
- Just trust me.

1263
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:48,695
Great.

1264
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:10,884
No thanks.

1265
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:14,346
- Lighten up,
everybody's doing it.

1266
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:15,722
- Jasmine, I don't feel too...

1267
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:16,556
- Hey.

1268
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:27,317
What do you think
you're doing here?

1269
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:28,151
- Luke, stop.

1270
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,654
- Actually, I was just leaving.

1271
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:33,615
- That's a good idea.

1272
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,619
- Michael, wait.

1273
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:39,162
- Jasmine, would you let him go.

1274
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,540
- Let go of me.

1275
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:42,708
- The guy's a joke.

1276
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:43,750
Do you get that?

1277
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:44,710
- Let go of her.

1278
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:46,378
- [Jasmine] Hey!

1279
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:49,172
(Lucas yelling)

1280
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:50,507
- Let go of me!

1281
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:52,884
You're a joke!

1282
01:06:58,765 --> 01:06:59,683
- You okay?

1283
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:00,684
- Yeah.

1284
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,437
Let's just go.

1285
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,271
- Okay.

1286
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:06,398
I'm sorry.

1287
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:21,872
(humming)

1288
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:28,795
- Wow, I've never seen you up

1289
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:30,172
and dressed this early
on a Sunday morning.

1290
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,424
- Yeah, I told Jasmine I'd pick

1291
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:33,341
her up on the way.

1292
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:37,387
- Hey, you got a sec?

1293
01:07:38,472 --> 01:07:39,264
- Sure.

1294
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,768
- How do you feel
about last night?

1295
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:45,896
- What do you mean?

1296
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:48,356
- Well, your mom
and I didn't mean

1297
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,734
to create such an
uncomfortable situation.

1298
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:54,696
- Yeah, probably not good
planning on our part.

1299
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:57,115
- Yeah, that wasn't our intent.

1300
01:07:58,283 --> 01:07:59,409
It's just that
I've been spending

1301
01:07:59,493 --> 01:08:01,620
a lot of time counseling
with the Greens,

1302
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:02,871
and as you probably
know, they've been

1303
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,331
having a lot of
problems with Lucas.

1304
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:08,794
- Yeah, them and me both.

1305
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:11,421
- Oh, wow.

1306
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,048
Where did you get that?

1307
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:13,882
- Lucas.

1308
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,843
Bumped into him last night.

1309
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,512
- Looks like more than a bump.

1310
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:21,890
- Yeah, so you can
forget about me and him

1311
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:22,682
being friends.

1312
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,060
- Actually, I think you can be

1313
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:27,813
a really positive
influence in his life.

1314
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:29,689
- He won't even talk to me.

1315
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:31,525
At least in a civilized tone.

1316
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,194
- I think you need
to reach out to him.

1317
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:35,195
He's worth the effort.

1318
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,656
- Dad, he hates me.

1319
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,783
Don't you see that?

1320
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,827
And to be honest,
the feeling's mutual.

1321
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:42,953
- Well, have you done anything

1322
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:44,246
to make him hate you?

1323
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,289
- Uh, breathe?

1324
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:48,750
- Well, all the better reason.

1325
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:51,336
Mike, he lost his brother.

1326
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:52,796
There's a lot of pain there.

1327
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:53,964
- See, but that's
another thing, dad.

1328
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:55,507
He doesn't want
me seeing Jasmine

1329
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,718
because she was
Chase's girlfriend.

1330
01:08:58,802 --> 01:08:59,719
He doesn't want to move on,

1331
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:01,388
and he wants no one
else to move on.

1332
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,851
- Hell, I wouldn't
want to move on.

1333
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:09,855
- [Mike] And now
you're defending him.

1334
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,815
- No, I'm not defending him,

1335
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:14,484
just trying to understand him.

1336
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:18,363
For him, moving on means
leaving Chase behind.

1337
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,157
He needs somebody to guide

1338
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:22,701
him through this transition.

1339
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:24,828
Mike, Jesus was pretty clear

1340
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,746
about loving people.

1341
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:27,747
Loving the ones that love us,

1342
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:31,084
that's easy,
anybody can do that.

1343
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,461
It's loving the
ones that hate us,

1344
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:36,381
now that's the real challenge.

1345
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:41,094
- Just great.

1346
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,765
- I take that to mean
you're up for the challenge.

1347
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:46,683
I don't want to be late.

1348
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:47,934
I'll see you guys after service.

1349
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:56,526
- That took longer
than I thought.

1350
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:57,319
- Yeah.

1351
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:58,111
- One more day, right?

1352
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,070
- Yup, see ya.

1353
01:09:59,154 --> 01:09:59,905
- See ya.

1354
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:04,701
Perfect.

1355
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:13,793
(Lucas sighs)

1356
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:17,130
So, did he put you up to this?

1357
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,840
- Up to what?

1358
01:10:18,924 --> 01:10:19,841
- What do you want?

1359
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:24,054
- I wanted to apologize
for the other night.

1360
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,306
They didn't know.

1361
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:28,058
- They didn't know what?

1362
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:30,477
That inviting me over to dinner

1363
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,479
with a guy that I
hate, and then throwing

1364
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,813
my brother's
girlfriend in the mix

1365
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:35,065
was a bad idea?

1366
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:38,318
That sounds like a setup to me.

1367
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:40,236
- Honest, Lucas, it wasn't.

1368
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,363
I mean, that was the first time

1369
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:42,989
he introduced me to his parents.

1370
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:44,866
- Save it for someone who cares.

1371
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,159
- Look, can we just talk?

1372
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:53,541
- What do you want from me, Jas?

1373
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:01,383
- Do you ever think about him?

1374
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:04,386
- Everyday.

1375
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:12,894
- Where did we go wrong?

1376
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:15,939
- Wrong?

1377
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,565
We weren't there for him.

1378
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:21,027
- [Jasmine] Do you think
we could have changed it?

1379
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,280
- What are you asking?

1380
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:26,950
- I don't know, I just, I
know something was wrong.

1381
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:27,993
I could have done something.

1382
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:29,953
- We all could have
done something!

1383
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:32,455
You know, that's the
hard part, right?

1384
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:36,042
- I don't know, I don't
know anything anymore.

1385
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:40,088
- Well, let me get it
straight for you, okay?

1386
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:43,008
As far as I'm
concerned, what happened

1387
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:45,885
was an accident, it
was a tragic accident,

1388
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:48,221
and I don't want to hear
you say anything different.

1389
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,097
Do you understand?

1390
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:54,561
- Yeah, I understand.

1391
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:57,814
(soft music)

1392
01:11:57,897 --> 01:11:58,940
- I gotta go.

1393
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,110
- Lucas.

1394
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,030
We have to move on.

1395
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,949
- Move on?

1396
01:12:08,033 --> 01:12:09,242
Move on to what?

1397
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,870
What do you want me to do?

1398
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:14,956
- I have to move on.

1399
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,958
I don't know if
you realize this,

1400
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:18,626
but it's killing me.

1401
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,546
All the what ifs.

1402
01:12:23,048 --> 01:12:26,718
Please, Lucas, just don't
let this destroy you.

1403
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:28,887
I mean, we've been
through enough already.

1404
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:32,307
- I'll live my life
the way I choose.

1405
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:37,896
- He's not coming back.

1406
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:42,192
Ever.

1407
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,616
And there's something else.

1408
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,745
You've got to stop
blaming this on Michael.

1409
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:59,292
- I wondered how
long that would take.

1410
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,461
- He's a really nice guy if
you just get to know him.

1411
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:04,130
- I don't want to
get to know him!

1412
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:05,840
Do you get that?

1413
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:08,676
And you, what are you doing?

1414
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:13,723
No, really, I bet Chase
would be so proud.

1415
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:17,185
(Jasmine crying)

1416
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:25,860
- I've got to move on.

1417
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:28,446
I've got to move on.

1418
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:31,241
- I have to move on too.

1419
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,409
Out of here.

1420
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:38,915
(engine revs)

1421
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:41,417
(tires squeal)

1422
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:17,912
- Hey, Luke.

1423
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:19,038
I'll be right with you, man.

1424
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:30,508
Awesome playoff run, man.

1425
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:33,094
One more and you've
got this thing.

1426
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:36,139
- Yeah.

1427
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,225
- We just received our
shipment of baseball

1428
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:41,102
equipment in last week.

1429
01:14:41,186 --> 01:14:43,146
We still have some cool
stuff coming in too.

1430
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,241
You moving to wood this year?

1431
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:03,082
You know, we have a
sweet little hybrid

1432
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,959
coming in in our next shipment.

1433
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,795
With your upper body strength...

1434
01:15:07,879 --> 01:15:08,838
- I'll take this one.

1435
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:15,428
Actually, I'm gonna
take all those.

1436
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:19,349
- Okay.

1437
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:38,368
♪ Everyday, I can

1463
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:13,439
- Honestly, it was definitely
a shock to see her.

1464
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,944
But it was good, it was
nice to see her again.

1465
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,447
- Please know, we had no idea.

1466
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:25,451
- Pastor, once
thing you'll learn

1467
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:29,414
about this small town is,
everybody knows everybody.

1468
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:31,916
- And that actually
might be something

1469
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:33,543
that's gonna help
you two the most.

1470
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,545
- How so?

1471
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:37,922
- Well, one of the
things we're learning

1472
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:39,882
about this town is how much

1473
01:18:39,966 --> 01:18:41,175
you care for each other.

1474
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:45,096
I guess it's what you
call Southern hospitality.

1475
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:47,682
- We have felt loved.

1476
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:51,894
Even though it's been
a very difficult year.

1477
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:57,859
- Well, over time,
that's really gonna help.

1478
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:08,202
- Why did God take
our son from us?

1479
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,290
- Is that really
what you're thinking?

1480
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:16,377
- Honestly, yeah.

1481
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:22,091
- I've tried to tell her
that's just not true.

1482
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:29,724
- Sally, I could give
you a lot of scripture.

1483
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:32,393
Even clichés.

1484
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:39,317
The honest truth
is, God loves us.

1485
01:19:41,736 --> 01:19:44,572
- Well, excuse me if I'm
not feeling the love.

1486
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:47,825
- [Alex] It's understandable.

1487
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:52,538
Ultimately, God's purpose
in all of our lives

1488
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,750
is that we're learning
to trust him more.

1489
01:19:57,919 --> 01:19:59,879
I understand your
feelings towards God.

1490
01:20:01,589 --> 01:20:04,425
But better than that,
he understands them.

1491
01:20:06,052 --> 01:20:08,137
And I believe it's
okay for you to tell

1492
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:09,639
him exactly how you feel.

1493
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:13,518
- Even if it's hurt?

1494
01:20:14,519 --> 01:20:16,604
Even if it's hate?

1495
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:17,438
Anger?

1496
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:21,692
- Don't you think
he already knows?

1497
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,447
I often wonder how
someone with no

1498
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:28,824
relationship with
God at all could get

1499
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:30,576
through such a difficult thing.

1500
01:20:33,371 --> 01:20:35,456
Sally, trust him.

1501
01:20:36,624 --> 01:20:38,417
He will guide you through this.

1502
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:57,436
- There's another
issue that is...

1503
01:20:58,479 --> 01:20:59,480
Weighing on us heavily.

1504
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:04,026
It's Lucas.

1505
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:07,780
- He's just...

1506
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:12,702
He's so full of anger.

1507
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:22,128
- How has he changed
since Chase's death.

1508
01:21:24,589 --> 01:21:25,673
- Denial mainly.

1509
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:29,552
Rejecting our
authority in his life.

1510
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,724
Becoming distant, argumentative.

1511
01:21:36,142 --> 01:21:38,894
Pastor, you saw him the
other night at dinner.

1512
01:21:42,023 --> 01:21:43,691
- About the only thing that he

1513
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:46,527
has any interest
in is basketball.

1514
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:50,156
- That actually might
be the best thing

1515
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,115
for him right now.

1516
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:56,162
And you know, it
also gives you two

1517
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:57,788
a powerful tool
to encourage him.

1518
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:00,541
- In what way?

1519
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:04,712
- Well, God's word tells
us that we're fearfully

1520
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:05,713
and wonderfully made.

1521
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:09,258
And even when we're
our most unlovable,

1522
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:10,301
that's still true.

1523
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:13,220
but when you and
I see each other

1524
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:16,390
from that perspective,
it changes

1525
01:22:16,474 --> 01:22:17,683
the way we treat each other.

1526
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:22,688
And don't
underestimate the power

1527
01:22:22,772 --> 01:22:23,648
of the spoken word.

1528
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:28,319
Encourage him, build him up.

1529
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:30,988
Compliment him any
chance you get.

1530
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:34,742
You know that old nursery rhyme?

1531
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:36,535
Sticks and stones
will break my bones,

1532
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:37,912
but words will never harm me.

1533
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,915
Well, that couldn't be
further from the truth.

1534
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:43,417
It's the enemy that
tells us we have

1535
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:46,087
no value, and that we're flawed.

1536
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:48,923
Lucas needs to
know he has value.

1537
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:51,884
True value.

1538
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:54,178
In your eyes and God's.

1539
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:02,353
- He already has a big ego.

1540
01:23:03,354 --> 01:23:05,231
- Sure there's a balance there,

1541
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,692
but I think he'd be shocked

1542
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:09,360
at how he really sees himself.

1543
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,113
- I think he knows
that we love him.

1544
01:23:13,698 --> 01:23:14,865
- He probably does.

1545
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:20,871
But sometimes, this
might sound strange,

1546
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:22,623
sometimes that's not enough.

1547
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:27,753
Make sure you put
your love into action.

1548
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:33,175
Can I ask you a hard question?

1549
01:23:36,721 --> 01:23:39,056
Would you die for Lucas?

1550
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:41,684
- Of course.

1551
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,602
- Then let me ask
you to do something

1552
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:44,854
even more difficult.

1553
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:48,733
Live for him.

1554
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:52,570
Lay your life down
for him daily.

1555
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:58,492
Let him see your love for
him in action, everyday.

1556
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:08,502
- That's actually the more
difficult choice, isn't it?

1557
01:24:12,298 --> 01:24:13,299
- Yes it is.

1558
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:18,220
And it's okay for him
to see you struggle.

1559
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:20,765
Even fail.

1560
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:24,643
Our kids do not expect
us to be perfect.

1561
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:28,230
They've just gotta be
secure in the knowledge

1562
01:24:28,314 --> 01:24:32,026
that we are battling
with them and for them.

1563
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:47,416
- [Coach] That's it.

1564
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:51,003
Come on, box him out, swing it.

1565
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:53,798
Better, better.

1566
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,217
Hey, everybody in.

1567
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:03,724
I like what I saw today.

1568
01:25:03,808 --> 01:25:06,393
Good hustle and good teamwork.

1569
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:11,065
We got Brandon back, we
won three tough games

1570
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:14,777
without him, but
Rockmore is a much

1571
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,446
bigger and more physical team.

1572
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:19,824
Look, guys, this is it.

1573
01:25:19,907 --> 01:25:21,992
The championship game.

1574
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,413
What we worked
for all year long.

1575
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:27,832
It's gonna be a challenge,

1576
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:31,544
but it's one we're up to, right?

1577
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:32,878
- [Players] Right.

1578
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:35,047
- All right, let's get it in.

1579
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,924
Tigers on three.

1580
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:38,467
One, two, three.

1581
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:39,760
- [All] Tigers!

1582
01:25:39,844 --> 01:25:41,929
- All right, good
job today, guys.

1583
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:44,223
I like what I saw, Tyler.

1584
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:46,058
Good job, Wallace.

1585
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:49,937
- [Mike] Hey, Lucas.

1586
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:52,982
Can I talk to you a minute?

1587
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,194
Hey, you know, we got
off on the wrong foot.

1588
01:25:57,278 --> 01:26:01,407
And I wanted to apologize
if I did anything

1589
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,367
to offend you.

1590
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:07,246
- You want to apologize?

1591
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:10,916
I'll tell you what you can do.

1592
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,960
You can quit the
team, stop hanging

1593
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:15,254
around Jasmine, move
back where you came from.

1594
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:19,049
- Look, I know you've
been through a lot.

1595
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:20,175
- I'll tell you what you know,

1596
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:21,886
you don't know anything.

1597
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,929
This is who I am, me, Lucas.

1598
01:26:24,013 --> 01:26:24,972
I'm comfortable with it.

1599
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,808
- Lucas, listen to me, okay?

1600
01:26:27,892 --> 01:26:29,310
- [Lucas] No, no, you listen.

1601
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:30,644
You come in here and try to take

1602
01:26:30,728 --> 01:26:31,854
what's not yours, be
a part of something

1603
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:34,648
you didn't help
build, and you have

1604
01:26:34,732 --> 01:26:35,774
the nerve to tell me you know

1605
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:37,026
what I'm going through?

1606
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:39,653
You're just like every
other Bible Thumper

1607
01:26:39,737 --> 01:26:40,946
I've ever met.

1608
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,197
You think you got
all the answers?

1609
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:43,032
Huh?

1610
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,660
Well you can take them
back where you came from.

1611
01:26:46,744 --> 01:26:47,995
Got it?

1612
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:51,040
(soft guitar music)

1613
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:00,841
- So then Lucas grabs this guy,

1614
01:27:00,925 --> 01:27:03,177
and he yells,
don't you ever mess

1615
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,428
with my brother again.

1616
01:27:08,015 --> 01:27:09,558
- So he was a good
big brother, huh?

1617
01:27:09,642 --> 01:27:12,561
- Yeah, yeah, he's the best.

1618
01:27:12,645 --> 01:27:15,356
I think that's what's
been hardest on him,

1619
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:16,482
you know?

1620
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:17,900
He carries a lot of guilt.

1621
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:23,948
So, I'm taking his
brother's place

1622
01:27:24,031 --> 01:27:27,868
on the basketball team, and
his brother's girlfriend.

1623
01:27:31,914 --> 01:27:33,749
I've definitely given him plenty

1624
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:34,583
of reason to hate me.

1625
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:38,754
- He'll come around,
just give it some time.

1626
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:41,715
You might not
believe it, but Lucas

1627
01:27:41,799 --> 01:27:43,175
is not a bad person.

1628
01:27:44,385 --> 01:27:46,053
- I'd hate to see
your definition

1629
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:47,596
of a bad person.

1630
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:50,224
(both laughing)

1631
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:53,894
- So, you excited about
the big game tomorrow?

1632
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:58,023
- Oh yeah, I'll have the
best seat in the house.

1633
01:27:58,107 --> 01:28:00,025
- What's that supposed to mean?

1634
01:28:00,109 --> 01:28:01,986
- It means that just
like the last two games,

1635
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:03,445
I'm probably not going to play.

1636
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:07,366
But I'll have a
great courtside seat,

1637
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:09,910
and I'll get in for free,
so it'll all work out.

1638
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:12,246
- Do you want to play?

1639
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:16,959
- Nah, I'm good.

1640
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:19,420
- Well, I think you're
a really good player,

1641
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,463
and you don't give
yourself enough credit.

1642
01:28:21,547 --> 01:28:23,007
- Really?

1643
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:24,091
- Really.

1644
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:25,843
And it wouldn't
surprise me if you were

1645
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:26,969
in the game tomorrow.

1646
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:29,013
- Let's hope not.

1647
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:32,016
- Like I said, you
don't give yourself

1648
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:33,517
enough credit.

1649
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,353
- You see, I just call
it being realistic.

1650
01:28:39,023 --> 01:28:39,773
That's it.

1651
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:46,905
- Hey.

1652
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:47,990
I have an idea.

1653
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:50,993
I need to show you something.

1654
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,163
- Okay, what?

1655
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:57,124
- Just come on.

1656
01:28:57,207 --> 01:28:58,333
Just come on.

1657
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:01,211
(soft piano music)

1658
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,466
- [Mike] Okay, where
are you taking me?

1659
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:07,634
- [Jasmine] Just park
in front of the gym.

1660
01:29:24,485 --> 01:29:26,612
- You're gonna get us arrested.

1661
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:28,906
- Don't worry, my dad's
on the school board.

1662
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:33,452
- Okay, so what do
you want to show me?

1663
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:35,037
- Just come on.

1664
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:35,871
Come with me.

1665
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:45,255
- How did you know
that would be open?

1666
01:29:45,339 --> 01:29:46,131
- I have my ways.

1667
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:54,014
What?

1668
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:55,641
- [Mike] We gonna play
basketball or something?

1669
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:56,975
- [Jasmine] Oh, no,
no, I don't want

1670
01:29:57,059 --> 01:29:58,227
to embarrass you, so...

1671
01:30:03,065 --> 01:30:05,109
Remember, do you trust me?

1672
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,487
- [Mike] Yes, okay.

1673
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,656
- [Jasmine] Okay, come on.

1674
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:13,450
I have a little something
special for you.

1675
01:30:13,534 --> 01:30:16,370
- [Mike] Okay.

1676
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:20,082
- [Jasmine] Come on,
you'll like it, I promise.

1677
01:30:26,213 --> 01:30:27,214
- Where are we going?

1678
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:28,090
- Just follow me.

1679
01:30:29,133 --> 01:30:32,261
(soft piano music)

1680
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:34,346
- This is crazy.

1681
01:30:36,682 --> 01:30:38,517
- You're about to miss it.

1682
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,518
- All right.

1683
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:45,899
- [Jasmine] Come on,
we're gonna miss it.

1684
01:30:48,277 --> 01:30:50,279
- Oh my gosh, the fireworks.

1685
01:30:51,405 --> 01:30:53,574
- This is my favorite
place to watch them.

1686
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:54,616
- Well, yeah, it's
the perfect spot.

1687
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:02,374
- Hey, I've got
something for you.

1688
01:31:07,254 --> 01:31:08,714
- What's this?

1689
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:10,257
- What does it look like, silly?

1690
01:31:11,717 --> 01:31:13,260
- Well, I know
what it is, but...

1691
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:18,098
- I want you to wear this
while you play basketball.

1692
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:22,060
You know, to give you
strength and courage.

1693
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:26,231
- Shouldn't I be the
one giving you a cross?

1694
01:31:26,315 --> 01:31:27,065
- Maybe.

1695
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:32,029
And you know, you're
a much better player

1696
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:33,697
than you give
yourself credit for.

1697
01:31:34,865 --> 01:31:36,158
- How?

1698
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:36,992
- Well, I do.

1699
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:42,080
And this will remind you
that I believe in you.

1700
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:46,168
- Thank you.

1701
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:06,605
Wow.

1702
01:32:07,981 --> 01:32:11,109
(fireworks going off)

1703
01:32:11,193 --> 01:32:11,944
Whoa.

1704
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:24,331
- Come on, lie down.

1705
01:32:25,332 --> 01:32:26,500
Come on, I don't bite.

1706
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:30,379
Now look.

1707
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:31,213
- Wow.

1708
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:35,259
- [Jasmine] Have you ever
seen anything this beautiful?

1709
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:38,345
- Are you talking
about the stars

1710
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:41,181
or about the fireworks
or about you?

1711
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:42,808
(Jasmine laughs)

1712
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:43,642
- Good answer.

1713
01:32:44,851 --> 01:32:47,104
But in this case, I'm
talking about the stars.

1714
01:32:48,647 --> 01:32:50,274
Tell me, what's the first thing

1715
01:32:50,357 --> 01:32:51,358
that comes into your
mind when you look

1716
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:52,401
at all this.

1717
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:58,490
- Lift up your eyes and
look to the heavens.

1718
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:01,285
Who created all these?

1719
01:33:03,245 --> 01:33:06,373
He who brings out the
sorry hosts one by one

1720
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:08,709
and calls forth each
of them by name.

1721
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:13,839
Because of his great
power and mighty strength,

1722
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:17,050
not one of them is missing.

1723
01:33:19,052 --> 01:33:19,845
- Wow.

1724
01:33:21,013 --> 01:33:23,682
I'm guessing that's
from the Bible.

1725
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:25,392
- No, I wrote that.

1726
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:26,393
(both laugh)

1727
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:29,563
Yeah, when we lived in Colorado,

1728
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:32,482
my dad and I, we'd
always go camping.

1729
01:33:32,566 --> 01:33:35,861
He'd teach me the
names of the stars,

1730
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:37,779
and he taught me that verse.

1731
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:41,742
- Can you teach them to me?

1732
01:33:44,161 --> 01:33:44,953
- Sure.

1733
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:50,083
Okay, you see that really
bright one up there?

1734
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:50,917
- Yeah.

1735
01:33:53,045 --> 01:33:54,379
Wait.

1736
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:55,213
Let me guess.

1737
01:33:56,423 --> 01:33:57,299
Betelgeuse.

1738
01:33:58,258 --> 01:34:01,678
- That's a nice guess, but no.

1739
01:34:01,762 --> 01:34:03,305
Actually, that's not
even a star at all.

1740
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:04,389
that's Mars actually.

1741
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:10,812
- Hey.

1742
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:12,981
Sit up with me, okay?

1743
01:34:23,075 --> 01:34:23,867
Close your eyes.

1744
01:34:27,496 --> 01:34:28,622
No peeking.

1745
01:34:28,705 --> 01:34:29,456
- Okay, okay.

1746
01:34:30,874 --> 01:34:32,250
- Now, hold out your hand.

1747
01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:36,421
- Is this another one
of those trust things?

1748
01:34:36,505 --> 01:34:37,255
- Kind of.

1749
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:40,175
Hold out your hand.

1750
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:43,095
(soft piano music)

1751
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:55,732
- It's my turn.

1752
01:34:55,816 --> 01:34:57,484
- Uh-uh, you picked
all last week.

1753
01:34:57,567 --> 01:34:58,902
- It is my turn.

1754
01:34:58,985 --> 01:35:00,112
- Hey, you two, let's get going,

1755
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:01,405
you're gonna be late.

1756
01:35:01,488 --> 01:35:03,281
- Mom, tell Mike
that it's my turn

1757
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:04,491
to pick the radio station.

1758
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:05,951
- You picked last time.

1759
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:08,161
- Meaner!

1760
01:35:08,245 --> 01:35:09,371
- Mike, why don't
you let her pick

1761
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:10,288
the radio station?

1762
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,541
- Mom, she listens to classical.

1763
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:13,834
- And Mike is going
to get to pick

1764
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:15,252
the radio station all next week.

1765
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:16,378
- That's not fair.

1766
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:18,296
- Okay, off you two, off.

1767
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:19,172
Go, go, go.

1768
01:35:20,382 --> 01:35:22,342
Mike, drive carefully, okay?

1769
01:35:23,427 --> 01:35:24,636
- Honey, don't forget I'm gonna

1770
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:25,929
be late tonight, we
have a deacons meeting.

1771
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:29,349
- Wait, before you
go, I have something

1772
01:35:29,433 --> 01:35:30,517
important to show you.

1773
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:36,273
I found this in
Mike's pants pocket.

1774
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:45,866
- I could stand here and give

1775
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:50,078
you guys a speech about focus.

1776
01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:52,164
About hustle.

1777
01:35:53,582 --> 01:35:54,541
Or team work.

1778
01:35:56,585 --> 01:35:59,754
About how the
practice, hard work,

1779
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:06,678
and dedication comes
down to one last game.

1780
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:12,684
One chance to do
something spectacular.

1781
01:36:14,394 --> 01:36:17,856
Something that you will
cherish for a lifetime.

1782
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,443
And all that's important.

1783
01:36:23,403 --> 01:36:25,489
I want you to focus
on the moment.

1784
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:27,741
Enjoy it.

1785
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:31,369
Relish every play.

1786
01:36:33,038 --> 01:36:38,043
In life, man, games like this,

1787
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:39,711
they rarely occur.

1788

forgive us our trespasses

1801

as we forgive others
who trespass against us.

1802
01:37:28,885 --> 01:37:32,013
Lead us not into temptation,

1803
01:37:32,097 --> 01:37:35,892
but deliver us from evil.

1804
01:37:35,976 --> 01:37:39,479

kingdom, the power,

1805

1814
01:38:18,518 --> 01:38:19,561
if one of us fell off the roof?

1815
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:31,615
Do you think they
would stop the game

1816
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:33,658
or would it just go on?

(whistle blows)

1966
01:45:33,953 --> 01:45:36,080
- [Referee] Foul, red 1-4.

1967
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:46,007
All right, one shot.

1968
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,092
- Time out, Mr. Ref,
let me get a timeout.

1969
01:45:48,176 --> 01:45:49,927
(whistle blows)

1970
01:45:50,011 --> 01:45:51,220
- Okay, here we go.

1971
01:45:51,304 --> 01:45:53,014
Come on, guys, guys,
bring it in, bring it in.

1972
01:45:54,974 --> 01:45:57,185
All right, guys,
listen up, settle down.

1973
01:45:57,268 --> 01:45:58,436
- He's not gonna make them.

1974
01:45:58,519 --> 01:45:59,771
I just don't think
he's gonna make them.

1975
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:01,272
He can't handle the
pressure right now.

1976
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:02,815
- It's one and one.

1977
01:46:02,899 --> 01:46:05,860
If he misses the
first one, Brandon,

1978
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:07,862
Brian, I need you
to tip in a rebound.

1979
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:09,072
Okay?

1980
01:46:09,155 --> 01:46:09,947
All right, all right?

1981
01:46:10,031 --> 01:46:10,865
Okay.

1982
01:46:10,948 --> 01:46:12,200
Now, if he makes the first one...

1983
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:13,409
- Coach.

1984
01:46:13,493 --> 01:46:15,119
- If he makes the first one...

1985
01:46:15,203 --> 01:46:16,496
- Coach, he's got it.

1986
01:46:16,579 --> 01:46:17,330
You got it.

1987
01:46:19,332 --> 01:46:20,708
- All right, all right.

1988
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:22,043
okay, here we go, here we go.

1989
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:23,086
Tigers on three.

1990
01:46:23,169 --> 01:46:24,587
One, two, three.

1991
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:25,421
- [All] Tigers!

1992
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:28,382
- Get the shot off
as fast as you can,

1993
01:46:28,466 --> 01:46:29,842
because you only got
four seconds, okay?

1994
01:46:29,926 --> 01:46:31,052
All right, you all ready?

1995
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:31,969
Here we go, cats on three.

1996
01:46:32,053 --> 01:46:33,012
Come on, man, let's finish this.

1997
01:46:33,096 --> 01:46:34,097
Okay?

1998
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:34,889
One, two, three.

1999
01:46:34,972 --> 01:46:36,057
- [All] Cats!

2000
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:37,642
- Here we go, Mike.

2001
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:39,977
Come on, you can do this.

2002
01:46:40,061 --> 01:46:42,605
(intense music)

2003
01:46:44,482 --> 01:46:47,485
(crowd cheers)

2004
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:49,070
- Shoot one.

2005
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:52,156
(inspiring music)

2006
01:47:01,082 --> 01:47:02,875
- Yes!

2007
01:47:02,959 --> 01:47:04,043
Good job, Mike.

2008
01:47:04,127 --> 01:47:06,838
(crowd cheers)

2009
01:47:12,218 --> 01:47:13,511
- One shot.

2010
01:47:13,594 --> 01:47:15,888
- [Cheerleaders] Hey you,
stand at the free throw line,

2011
01:47:15,972 --> 01:47:18,432
miss it, miss it.

2012
01:47:18,516 --> 01:47:21,060
Hey, you, at the
free throw line,

2013
01:47:21,144 --> 01:47:22,854
we say, we say.

2014
01:47:22,937 --> 01:47:25,439
Hey, you, at the
free throw line,

2015
01:47:25,523 --> 01:47:27,316
we say, we say.

2016
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:30,111
Hey, you, at the
free throw line,

2017
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:31,946
we say, we say.

2018
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:33,447
Hey, you, at the
free throw line,

2019
01:47:33,531 --> 01:47:35,324
we say, we say.

2020
01:47:35,408 --> 01:47:38,161
(inspiring music)

2021
01:47:43,124 --> 01:47:45,835
(crowd cheers)

2022
01:47:49,547 --> 01:47:50,715
- Yes!

2023
01:47:50,798 --> 01:47:52,633
I'm talking about Mike!

2024
01:47:56,512 --> 01:47:58,222
- Get back, get back.

2025
01:48:08,357 --> 01:48:09,901
(buzzer sounds)

2026
01:48:09,984 --> 01:48:12,945
- Yes, yes!

2027
01:48:13,029 --> 01:48:13,779
- Yes!

2028
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:24,081
- Yeah!

2029
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:25,958
Champions, baby!

2030
01:48:26,042 --> 01:48:28,544
- I had no idea you
were religious, man.

2031
01:48:28,628 --> 01:48:29,837
- I'm not, man.

2032
01:48:29,921 --> 01:48:31,297
I want to win the
championship, come on.

2033
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:32,673
Yeah, let's go!

2034
01:48:43,267 --> 01:48:44,018
- Hey.

2035
01:48:44,101 --> 01:48:44,852
- Hey.

2036
01:48:50,233 --> 01:48:51,234
What's on your mind?

2037
01:48:54,237 --> 01:48:55,363
- Guess what my mom found.

2038
01:48:58,241 --> 01:49:00,117
- Oh, don't tell me.

2039
01:49:00,201 --> 01:49:01,160
- Yeah.

2040
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:04,497
I forgot I left the
wrapper in my pocket.

2041
01:49:06,624 --> 01:49:09,043
- So, what did you tell her?

2042
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:13,172
- The truth.

2043
01:49:16,968 --> 01:49:19,845
Hey, I'm going to
see Jas, I'll be home

2044
01:49:19,929 --> 01:49:20,680
a little later.

2045
01:49:21,681 --> 01:49:23,057
- Hey, Mike.

2046
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:25,351
Before you go, you got a minute?

2047
01:49:25,434 --> 01:49:26,185
- Sure.

2048
01:49:27,353 --> 01:49:30,314
- Faith, honey,
can you let daddy

2049
01:49:30,398 --> 01:49:31,857
and I talk to Michael alone?

2050
01:49:31,941 --> 01:49:33,693
Besides, it's close
to your bed time.

2051
01:49:34,902 --> 01:49:37,697
- I know, you'll be
in to tuck me in.

2052
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:40,074
I never get to hear
the good stuff.

2053
01:49:44,662 --> 01:49:46,163
- Mike, why don't
you have a seat.

2054
01:49:51,252 --> 01:49:52,336
- What's up?

2055
01:49:55,131 --> 01:49:57,842
- Uh, Mike, I uh...

2056
01:49:59,885 --> 01:50:01,512
I found this in
your jeans pocket.

2057
01:50:03,389 --> 01:50:05,057
- You have some
explaining to do.

2058
01:50:07,893 --> 01:50:09,353
- It's not what it looks like.

2059
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:13,733
- Why was I expecting
that answer?

2060
01:50:26,662 --> 01:50:29,165
(soft music)

2061
01:51:08,371 --> 01:51:09,163
- Jasmine.

2062
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:11,582
Hey.

2063
01:51:15,419 --> 01:51:16,962
Look, I love you.

2064
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:23,386
And I love you too
much not to treat

2065
01:51:23,469 --> 01:51:28,432
you like how I'd want
my wife to be treated.

2066
01:51:30,684 --> 01:51:31,477
Okay?

2067
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:36,399
I'm not proposing or anything,

2068
01:51:36,482 --> 01:51:38,109
I'm just saying that I...

2069
01:51:38,192 --> 01:51:39,527
- Hey, hey.

2070
01:51:41,654 --> 01:51:42,446
Shhh.

2071
01:51:55,918 --> 01:51:57,461
Teach me more about the stars.

2072
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:12,685
- I bet your mom
thinks I'm a tramp.

2073
01:52:12,768 --> 01:52:13,519
- [Mike] Yeah.

2074
01:52:14,562 --> 01:52:15,312
(Jasmine chuckles)

2075
01:52:15,396 --> 01:52:16,147
- Jerk.

2076
01:52:18,607 --> 01:52:20,025
- That's the cool
thing about being

2077
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:21,026
a preacher's son.

2078
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,904
You can pull out the
grace and forgiveness

2079
01:52:23,988 --> 01:52:25,489
card like that.

2080
01:52:25,573 --> 01:52:28,701
(Michael snaps fingers)

2081
01:52:30,953 --> 01:52:32,288
- So, were you nervous?

2082
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:34,832
- I was scared to death.

2083
01:52:34,915 --> 01:52:37,710
Oh my gosh, like,
talking to your parents

2084
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:39,962
about sex is not easy.

2085
01:52:40,796 --> 01:52:42,006
- Actually, I was talking about

2086
01:52:42,089 --> 01:52:44,675
the basketball game and
the big free throws.

2087
01:52:45,634 --> 01:52:49,430
- Oh, yeah, then too, for sure.

2088
01:52:49,513 --> 01:52:51,515
- Did the necklace help?

2089
01:52:53,684 --> 01:52:54,518
- Actually it did.

2090
01:52:57,605 --> 01:53:00,900
It reminded me of where my
true strength comes from.

2091
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:05,404
- Why do you hang out with me?

2092
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:07,698
- Is that a serious question?

2093
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:10,784
- We're so different.

2094
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:15,956
- Probably not as
different as you think.

2095
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:18,000
- Really?

2096
01:53:18,083 --> 01:53:19,543
- [Mike] Seriously.

2097
01:53:19,627 --> 01:53:24,548
I mean, what, you think
I'm made of steel?

2098
01:53:24,632 --> 01:53:27,426
Like I don't have my struggles?

2099
01:53:28,511 --> 01:53:31,055
- You sure put on a good show.

2100
01:53:31,138 --> 01:53:32,223
- It's not a show.

2101
01:53:33,474 --> 01:53:36,143
But it's a struggle
just the same.

2102
01:53:37,853 --> 01:53:40,272
- I mean, wouldn't
your parents rather

2103
01:53:40,356 --> 01:53:41,899
you be dating Snow White?

2104
01:53:41,982 --> 01:53:46,946
- Jas, we all have a past.

2105
01:53:48,155 --> 01:53:50,699
And we all have our
current struggles.

2106
01:53:50,783 --> 01:53:54,119
I try to live my
life honoring God.

2107
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:57,790
And as the saying
goes, you know,

2108
01:53:57,873 --> 01:53:59,750
Christians are not perfect.

2109
01:54:02,670 --> 01:54:03,671
We're just forgiven.

2110
01:54:10,553 --> 01:54:12,304
- Do you think I'm forgiven?

2111
01:54:16,433 --> 01:54:18,519
- It's free for the asking.

2112
01:54:21,605 --> 01:54:23,023
- And my past?

2113
01:54:23,941 --> 01:54:25,067
- It can be just that.

2114
01:54:27,278 --> 01:54:28,070
The past.

2115
01:54:32,783 --> 01:54:33,993
- I want that.

2116
01:54:38,372 --> 01:54:40,541
- All you have to do is ask.

2117
01:54:48,173 --> 01:54:49,925
- Will you teach me to do that?

2118
01:54:53,512 --> 01:54:54,555
- Yeah.

2119
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,182
Yeah.

2120
01:54:58,434 --> 01:55:00,477
It's a lot easier than
astronomy lessons.

2121
01:55:12,948 --> 01:55:13,741
- Thank you.

2122
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:16,535
- [Mike] For what?

2123
01:55:17,578 --> 01:55:18,746
- For being you.

2124
01:55:30,299 --> 01:55:32,092
- [Mike] Hey, Lucas.

2125
01:55:32,176 --> 01:55:33,135
Hey, Lucas, wait up.

2126
01:55:38,223 --> 01:55:39,725
Hey, my dad's
having a fellowship

2127
01:55:39,808 --> 01:55:42,019
for the team at the
church, you know, later on.

2128
01:55:42,102 --> 01:55:44,730
I just wanted to invite you.

2129
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:47,650
Coach is going and
everything, so...

2130
01:55:48,901 --> 01:55:50,486
- A church fellowship?

2131
01:55:50,569 --> 01:55:52,279
- Yeah, but I mean, it's
a laid back get together.

2132
01:55:52,363 --> 01:55:53,614
It's not like...

2133
01:55:53,697 --> 01:55:54,657
- You can stop apologizing.

2134
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:55,491
It's all right.

2135
01:55:57,660 --> 01:55:58,661
Look, I'll go.

2136
01:55:58,744 --> 01:55:59,620
I just, I don't
want you to think

2137
01:55:59,703 --> 01:56:01,372
I'll be some kind of regular.

2138
01:56:01,455 --> 01:56:02,539
- Okay, deal.

2139
01:56:02,623 --> 01:56:04,166
- All right.

2140
01:56:04,249 --> 01:56:08,712
Besides, God doesn't want
anything to do with me.

2141
01:56:08,796 --> 01:56:11,090
- Do you really believe that?

2142
01:56:14,593 --> 01:56:15,344
- Man, you just don't know

2143
01:56:15,427 --> 01:56:16,470
what all I've done.

2144
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:19,723
I just, no.

2145
01:56:19,807 --> 01:56:20,599
God's not for me.

2146
01:56:21,892 --> 01:56:23,686
- I'll tell you what, you and I

2147
01:56:23,769 --> 01:56:26,188
will go to lunch together,

2148
01:56:26,271 --> 01:56:30,526
and if I can't
convince you otherwise,

2149
01:56:30,609 --> 01:56:33,654
then lunch is on me.

2150
01:56:33,737 --> 01:56:34,738
- A betting man, huh?

2151
01:56:36,115 --> 01:56:36,907
I like that.

2152
01:56:37,866 --> 01:56:38,951
Yeah, you got a deal.

2153
01:56:40,411 --> 01:56:41,620
- So, how does it feel?

2154
01:56:42,538 --> 01:56:43,580
- What going to church?

2155
01:56:43,664 --> 01:56:45,833
- No, being state champions.

2156
01:56:45,916 --> 01:56:50,421
- My whole life,
people have told me

2157
01:56:50,504 --> 01:56:53,757
I was dumb, I wasn't going
to amount to anything.

2158
01:56:54,967 --> 01:56:58,429
Proving them wrong
felt great, you know?

2159
01:57:00,055 --> 01:57:03,016
But I don't know, I
just kind of felt empty,

2160
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:08,063
just, I really wish Chase
could have been there.

2161
01:57:08,272 --> 01:57:09,773
You know?

2162
01:57:12,818 --> 01:57:13,652
- Yeah, me too.

2163
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:17,114
- Heck, you didn't
even know him.

2164
01:57:18,741 --> 01:57:23,454
- No, but I know best
friends are hard to come by.

2165
01:57:26,248 --> 01:57:28,792
- Yeah, Chase was the best.

2166
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:35,340
- Well, hey, I know you and I,

2167
01:57:35,424 --> 01:57:36,967
I don't imagine us
every being that close,

2168
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:40,596
but I just want to let you know,

2169
01:57:40,679 --> 01:57:42,723
I'm not giving up on you.

2170
01:57:53,108 --> 01:57:54,568
- Hey, Evans.

2171
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:55,694
Say it again.

2172
01:58:01,825 --> 01:58:03,744
- [Mike] I really meant
it when I said it.

2173
01:58:05,537 --> 01:58:06,830
I'm not giving up on you.

2174
01:58:07,873 --> 01:58:09,500
As crazy as it may
seem, Lucas and I

2175
01:58:09,583 --> 01:58:11,710
got past all our differences.

2176
01:58:11,794 --> 01:58:13,754
Yeah, it took time,
but it was worth it.

2177
01:58:14,797 --> 01:58:15,589
He was worth it.

2178
01:58:16,548 --> 01:58:17,883
And today, my life is richer

2179
01:58:17,966 --> 01:58:19,301
