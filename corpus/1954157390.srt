00:46:23,897 --> 00:46:26,500
<i> Do I stand over there,
or will it just pick up?</i>

711
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:29,214
SOUND ENGINEER: <i> Uh, I think
it will just pick up.</i>

712
00:46:29,224 --> 00:46:30,959
<i> These guys always
have faith.</i>

713
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:33,839
(PLAYING GUITAR)

714
00:46:35,444 --> 00:46:36,847
Hey, watch this.

<i> ♪ Once I was a lover</i>

720
00:47:04,607 --> 00:47:06,976
Can we get rid

722
00:47:09,045 --> 00:47:12,282

00:49:51,273 --> 00:49:56,212
WOMAN: <i> Train number 267,

Poughkeepsie, Rhinecliff,</i>

744
00:49:56,245 --> 00:50:00,016
<i> Hudson, Albany, Troy,
Amsterdam, Utica, Buffalo
and Niagara Falls.</i>

745
00:50:11,794 --> 00:50:15,431
There's a train
at 9:00 that we could get.

746
00:50:15,464 --> 00:50:18,167
I'm not too worried
about getting back.

747
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,503
You're just gonna
stay in Amsterdam?

748
00:50:20,536 --> 00:50:22,405
You know, frankly,
and I don't mean
this in a bad way,

749
00:50:22,438 --> 00:50:25,775
but this, this whole thing,

750
00:50:25,808 --> 00:50:27,543
this whole concert
is fuckin' ridiculous.

751
00:50:27,576 --> 00:50:30,347
Like all these people
paying tribute to Tim.

752
00:50:31,447 --> 00:50:33,683
They don't even know him.
They never knew him.

753
00:50:33,716 --> 00:50:37,387
Lee played with him,
Lee doesn't know
him, Lee is...

754
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,789
How does anyone
know anybody?

755
00:50:39,822 --> 00:50:41,558
We're all a million things.

756
00:50:49,832 --> 00:50:51,034
It's a...

757
00:50:54,637 --> 00:50:57,240
It's my father there
and that's his father.

758
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:01,644
He used to beat
the shit outta that boy.

759
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:04,314
Every day.

760
00:51:06,615 --> 00:51:08,818
I don't know...

761
00:51:08,851 --> 00:51:12,255
I mean, he spent his
entire life abandoning
the people he loves.

762
00:51:12,288 --> 00:51:14,290
Writing love songs.

763
00:51:14,323 --> 00:51:18,161
Fuck, I mean I get that,
I do, I get that,
but you know...

764
00:51:18,194 --> 00:51:20,597
He made six albums by
the time he was my age.

765
00:51:21,664 --> 00:51:24,834
So like what the fuck?
What am I doing here.

766
00:51:24,867 --> 00:51:27,136
I don't...
Why am I here?

767
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:29,172
And then all these people
like, "You look like him.

768
00:51:29,205 --> 00:51:31,407
"You look like him,
you look like him."

769
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:33,619
You do.

770
00:51:33,629 --> 00:51:35,365
You do, you look
like him.

771
00:51:35,878 --> 00:51:37,080
So?

772
00:51:53,462 --> 00:51:54,631
Where you going?

773
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:17,353
One for you,
one for me.

774
00:52:17,386 --> 00:52:19,522
No, thanks, I don't...

775
00:52:19,555 --> 00:52:21,391
I don't want that.

776
00:52:24,426 --> 00:52:26,129
I went to see
this, uh,

777
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:29,832
Kabuki

778
00:52:29,865 --> 00:52:33,503
performance the
other day, it's like,
Japanese theater.

779
00:52:33,536 --> 00:52:35,338
Yeah, I know
what Kabuki is.

780
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:41,177
This, uh,

781
00:52:42,678 --> 00:52:46,483
one actor was
like 70 years old.

782
00:52:47,683 --> 00:52:51,421
And his performance
was, like, exquisite.

783
00:52:52,688 --> 00:52:56,359
Like the way
he moved an eyebrow

784
00:52:56,392 --> 00:52:59,529
just affected you,
it was so weird.

785
00:52:59,562 --> 00:53:02,532
And I knew that I needed
to get something from him.

786
00:53:02,565 --> 00:53:04,667
You know what I mean?

787
00:53:06,669 --> 00:53:10,239
And the next day I went
along to the theater, and

788
00:53:10,272 --> 00:53:12,408
after the curtain
he appeared,

789
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:14,677
and I sauntered
up to him,

790
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:15,778
and I asked him,

791
00:53:15,811 --> 00:53:20,783
I was like,
"How did you do this
one magical thing?"

792
00:53:20,816 --> 00:53:22,818
I was like, "How
did you do it?

793
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:24,253
"How did you
prepare for it?"

794
00:53:24,286 --> 00:53:25,788
And he was like,
"Prepare?"

795
00:53:25,821 --> 00:53:27,690
And I was like, "Yeah,
for the performance."

796
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,493
And he said,

797
00:53:30,526 --> 00:53:33,930
"Well, every moment,
of every day is this."

798
00:53:37,866 --> 00:53:39,736
The performance
is no different.

799
00:53:43,606 --> 00:53:45,542
Yeah, I like that.

800
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,282
You do that.

801
00:53:53,315 --> 00:53:55,585
No, hardly, that's...

802
00:53:55,618 --> 00:53:57,520
You do that.

803
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,432
No, that's bullshit.

804
00:53:59,442 --> 00:54:03,179
I haven't done anything.

805
00:54:03,189 --> 00:54:06,926
You are able
to do that.

806
00:54:06,936 --> 00:54:08,238
(SIGHS)

807
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:10,450
Your father
did it too.

808
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,997
My father was
a total phony.

809
00:54:13,007 --> 00:54:15,543
You can't say that.

810
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:18,089
I can't say...
Why not?

811
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:21,003
My father was
a total phony.

812
00:54:21,013 --> 00:54:23,917
Did you know him?

813
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,363
Yes.

814
00:54:25,373 --> 00:54:26,574
Did you know him?

815
00:54:26,584 --> 00:54:27,785
Yes, I knew him.

816
00:54:27,795 --> 00:54:30,132
No, did you actually,
like, meet him?

817
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:32,779
Met him twice actually,
once when I was one year old,

818
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:34,891
he dropped by my birthday
to give me a rattle.

819
00:54:34,901 --> 00:54:37,638
How's that?
And then

820
00:54:37,648 --> 00:54:39,317
second time I was
eight years old,

821
00:54:39,327 --> 00:54:42,230
he invited me to come
see him perform at
the Troubadour.

822
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,511
It was his wife actually
who invited me to

823
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:47,823
come stay at their house
for three weeks.

824
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:49,735
Which I did,
and I never saw him.

825
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:52,282
I didn't see
him once. Why?

826
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:54,027
Because he was
at the studio every day,

827
00:54:54,037 --> 00:54:59,009
to make this album,
and he didn't invite
me to come along?

828
00:54:59,019 --> 00:55:00,555
No. Why?

829
00:55:00,565 --> 00:55:02,401
(CHUCKLES) Maybe
because he knew

830
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:04,113
I could fuckin'
out-sing him then.

831
00:55:04,123 --> 00:55:05,491
And as for his music,

832
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:08,938
my theory is that he just
found some hippy's
notebook on an acid trip.

833
00:55:08,948 --> 00:55:11,450
When he ran out of pages,
that's when he OD'd.

834
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,496
(LAUGHS)

835
00:55:13,506 --> 00:55:15,242
I'm serious,
I'm serious.

836
00:55:15,252 --> 00:55:17,154
I'm totally fuckin' serious.

837
00:55:17,164 --> 00:55:19,634
All I want to do...

838
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:58,875
<i> ♪ If a fiddler played you
a song, my love</i>

839
00:56:00,642 --> 00:56:06,683
<i> ♪ And if I gave you a wheel</i>

840
00:56:09,618 --> 00:56:15,058
<i>♪ Would you spin for my heart
and loneliness?</i>

841
00:56:17,493 --> 00:56:21,831
<i>♪ Would you spin for my love?</i>

842
00:56:26,402 --> 00:56:31,641
<i> ♪ If I gave up
all of my pride for you</i>

843
00:56:33,976 --> 00:56:38,348
<i> ♪ And only loved you for now</i>

844
00:56:42,518 --> 00:56:48,524
<i> ♪ Would you hide my fears
and never say</i>

845
00:56:50,526 --> 00:56:55,531
<i> ♪ Tomorrow I must go?</i>

846
00:57:02,004 --> 00:57:03,773
We got a
couple of hours.

847
00:57:06,175 --> 00:57:08,411
You wanna sample
the local Dr Pepper?

848
00:57:19,588 --> 00:57:21,023
Hey, how you doing?

849
00:57:21,056 --> 00:57:22,392
BARTENDER: All right.

850
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:26,595
BARTENDER: May I
help you folks?

851
00:57:26,628 --> 00:57:30,499
Can I get a shot
of Dewar's and a beer.

852
00:57:30,532 --> 00:57:31,701
BARTENDER: All right.

853
00:57:34,603 --> 00:57:36,505
And a Dr Pepper.

854
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:38,741
Ha! We've only got Pepsi.

855
00:57:38,774 --> 00:57:41,677
That's all right, thanks.

856
00:57:49,785 --> 00:57:51,854
So where do
you come from?

857
00:57:53,222 --> 00:57:55,791
I come from
the '70s.

858
00:57:55,824 --> 00:58:00,196
From the time of
big, big, bullshit,

859
00:58:01,663 --> 00:58:03,166
apart from one thing.

860
00:58:16,612 --> 00:58:17,613
What?

861
00:58:21,517 --> 00:58:23,553
I don't know,
I don't know.

862
00:58:23,563 --> 00:58:25,599
Say it.

863
00:58:29,558 --> 00:58:33,663
I have a mother,
I have a father, um...

864
00:58:35,597 --> 00:58:38,835
They fight over
the dishwasher.

865
00:58:50,946 --> 00:58:53,649
How long have you
had this place here?

866
00:58:53,682 --> 00:58:55,117
BARTENDER: Oh, 43 years.

867
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:58,087
43 years?
Oh, my God.

868
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,623
BARTENDER: My uncle left it
to my brother and me.

869
00:59:00,656 --> 00:59:02,525
I'll be outside.

870
00:59:02,558 --> 00:59:04,193
BARTENDER: We used
to have food in here.

871
00:59:04,226 --> 00:59:07,196
BARTENDER: Now,
it's all microwave.

872
00:59:07,206 --> 00:59:10,176
That's a shame.

873
00:59:22,945 --> 00:59:23,946
We should go.

874
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:30,653
Jeff.

875
00:59:39,127 --> 00:59:40,963
Where are
you going, Jeff?

876
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:48,838
Hey, guys, do you know
where 237 Mechanic Street is?

877
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:53,543
Yeah, it's down
there? Thank you.

878
00:59:57,379 --> 00:59:58,581
Hey!

879
01:00:00,849 --> 01:00:03,218
My father used
to live down there.

880
01:00:03,251 --> 01:00:04,253
Okay?

881
01:00:11,193 --> 01:00:13,629
Can I have your lighter?

882
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:16,075
Yeah.

883
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:16,452
