1
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,821
Anybody home?

2
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:36,616
Just us mice.

3
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:46,881
Is there something we could drink
that will make us two inches tall?

4
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:52,797
- Then we could move in.
- This fenestration here.

5
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,260
- The what?
- The windows.

6
00:04:56,476 --> 00:05:00,687
See the windows on the west wall?
It doesn't quite work.

7
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:06,235
Vincent, it's the most beautiful
I've ever seen.

8
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,147
Come over here.

9
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:13,195
- Who? Me?
- Yes, you.

10
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:25,794
What was your name again?

11
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:45,845
I do love you.

12
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,945
Go, go, go, go, go!

13
00:05:54,906 --> 00:06:00,066
I don't want to miss it!
Please, please, don't let me miss it.

14
00:06:12,131 --> 00:06:15,582
The contractor said
that tomorrow morning would be good.

15
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:20,961
We can finally get things started.
Can you get away for a few hours?

16
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:25,515
What's tomorrow? Wednesday, right?

17
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,937
- Yeah. Yeah, we can do that.
- Great.

18
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,776
I'll get the car this afternoon
so we get started early.

19
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:39,739
- What?
- Why do you do that?

20
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,863
- What do you mean?
- Why do you leave it at her place?

21
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:48,951
- Because I don't need it in town.
- Why not at my place?

22
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,910
Because your car is there.

23
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:56,290
It's convenient. There's a garage.
Please stop doing this.

24
00:06:56,507 --> 00:07:00,420
You don't live with her any more,
but your car still does.

25
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:05,427
What else do you leave there?
A toothbrush? A pair of slippers?

26
00:07:09,143 --> 00:07:10,471
A daughter.

27
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:13,854
Taxi!

28
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:16,854
Taxi, hold on a second.

29
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:21,195
It's not nice for her not knowing
if you've left or are coming back.

30
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:24,275
I'm not going back.
Why are you doing this?

31
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:26,567
I want to know where you live.

32
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:32,911
I live with you.

33
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:36,367
I love you.

34
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:44,131
With all those bridges,
you shouldn't be afraid to burn one.

35
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:55,473
Norman, I love the elevations.
I love them. A lot, a lot!

36
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:14,697
Second thoughts?

37
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:19,365
- I don't like the spacing of the columns.
- Is he starting again?

38
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:24,923
Neal, come here. Come here, look
at this. What does it remind you of?

39
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:28,631
- My grandfather's radiator.
- Only a bird sees it from there.

40
00:08:28,844 --> 00:08:30,919
- I see it.
- Sally, tell him.

41
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:35,716
- It's fabulous. Don't worry.
- Some act you two have.

42
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:39,801
A brilliant building. Frank Lloyd Wright
is eating his heart out.

43
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:45,181
Please sign off these specs for the
Tenly project. They're going crazy.

44
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,576
Oh, it's beautiful.

45
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,570
- You don't have to say that.
- I know.

46
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:13,257
The Antonio House is enclosed. Plumbing
and electric are finished on the 10th.

47
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:18,807
"Architectural Digest" wants
a photo session the week of the 15th.

48
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,099
Drive down the day before.
Gerry Fairchild wants to dine with you.

49
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,064
The old guy? How did you swing that?

50
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:30,520
I had Dad call him.
They went to school together.

51
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,688
You.

52
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:37,198
- You really are something.
- How's that?

53
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:43,537
You just keep right in there swinging
away... just like nothing's ever changed.

54
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:48,624
I'm protecting my investment. Can you
pick up Meaghan from ballet school?

55
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:52,881
- Today?
- Yeah. I have that fund-raiser.

56
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,551
- I can trade you something next week.
- That's all right. I'll do that.

57
00:09:57,762 --> 00:10:02,221
I have to pick up the car today.
I'll have Neal give me a ride.

58
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:05,682
- OK.
- Do we have anything early tomorrow?

59
00:10:05,894 --> 00:10:12,560
- No. Going somewhere?
- No, I... just had something to see.

60
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:17,437
- It's the museum thing in the afternoon.
- I'll be there by three.

61
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:20,442
- All right.
- Hey! That's nice.

62
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:25,699
The sweater. It's a nice colour on you.
I like it.

63
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:28,576
Don't do that.

64
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:49,929
Hey, girl, they're waiting for you,
as usual. Don't forget to call your mom.

65
00:10:51,354 --> 00:10:55,980
Business. Environment. Astrology.
Everybody OK?

66
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:59,525
- Wait. Where's Olivia?
- Who's Olivia?

67
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,572
- Try the valet parking.
- You're late.

68
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:09,114
Sorry.

69
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:13,244
- You could have faxed it in.
- I like to commute.

70
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,497
- How many words?
- 750.

71
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,411
'Women Who Demand Equality
Renounce Their Superiority."

72
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,588
- Norman Mailer will send a death threat.
- Wouldn't that be great?

73
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:32,132
- I'm not sure how the epilogue fits in.
- What epilogue?

74
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:41,399
- So that's why you turned me down.
- Charlie, you couldn't handle it.

75
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,310
- Try me.
- You sound like an ad for phone sex.

76
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,614
What does "V" stand for?

77
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:54,620
- When's Meaghan's spring vacation?
- The first two weeks of April.

78
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:57,914
Are you going right out to the island?

79
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:02,538
I won't be able to make it.
I'll be in the middle of some project.

80
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,922
Have you spoken to Meaghan
about this?

81
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:11,293
- I'll spend time with her before you go.
- Well, that'll work wonders.

82
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:15,182
We've got a problem
at the Tenly construction site.

83
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:32,907
- No parking, no lease!
- Why did you hire me for the job?

84
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:38,117
- We liked the design.
- Then stay with it! This is insane!

85
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,366
I need that parking space
to sign the lease.

86
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:45,877
- What is this crap?
- It's a minor problem. Eastman, listen.

87
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:49,337
- Read your contract!
- What?

88
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:52,218
Our attorney assures us
we have the right...

89
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:56,638
- Fuck my contract. Fuck you!
- We can push back.

90
00:12:56,847 --> 00:13:00,299
Is this a threat?
Is this man threatening me?

91
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:02,806
- No, he didn't...
- To hell with you!

92
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,389
Then bring your goddamn goombah
lawyers out of the woodwork!

93
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:08,017
Where's a phone?

94
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:11,732
You'll get your parking space.
Give it a day.

95
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:13,653
The man is crazy!

96
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,249
Very nice. Very diplomatic.

97
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:34,882
Come on, Neal. They don't need that
shit. They just want to be cute.

98
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:39,220
- They're the clients.
- Great men of vision.

99
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:44,720
Everybody has to work for somebody.
Michelangelo had to please the Pope.

100
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:47,604
The Pope didn't ask for parking space.

101
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:51,396
They're not bad guys.
They want a couple of changes.

102
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:53,933
Why take it out on them?

103
00:13:57,947 --> 00:14:01,814
What? Neal, taking what out?

104
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:07,619
Neal, tell me. Do you have something
to say? Do you have a problem?

105
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,409
- No, you do.
- Which is?

106
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:15,960
What?

107
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:23,967
You have an apartment in town,
a daughter in the house,

108
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:27,347
Sally in the office,
a girlfriend somewhere else...

109
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:29,966
Her name is Olivia.

110
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:35,014
It's bad design. You're supposed
to have everything under one roof.

111
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:37,357
Architecture 101.

112
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,921
I always loved this house.

113
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:04,548
Perfect house for the perfect couple.

114
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:08,760
It wasn't so perfect. See you tomorrow.

115
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:13,350
What you have now is perfect?
You had a family.

116
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:20,265
We weren't a family.

117
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:25,446
We were a corporation with a kid.

118
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:32,989
When the boys went off to college,

119
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:37,533
Claire and I were going to travel
the world, see all the museums.

120
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,502
The Prado, Paris, Florence, India even.

121
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,586
There was a Piero della Francesca
in a church in Arezzo.

122
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,882
The most beautiful thing in the world.

123
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:51,047
I wanted to show it to her.

124
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,385
We kept saying "next year".

125
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,819
Tempus fuglt, pal.
Whatever you're going to do, do it!

126
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:36,134
Hello?

127
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:38,887
Edwina?

128
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,139
Hello?

129
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:56,904
Meaghan?

130
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,405
Hello? Anybody here?

131
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,045
Hello?

132
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,046
Vincent, could you hand me
my robe, please?

133
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:06,553
Thank you.

134
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:18,017
I think Predock's going to get
that Santa Fe thing.

135
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:21,734
Predock? He's good.
He'll do a good job.

136
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:24,782
Not as good as you.

137
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:28,578
There's enough to go around.

138
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:33,537
Don't forget we have that thing
tomorrow night.

139
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,166
What? Oh, shit! That formal thing.

140
00:18:38,254 --> 00:18:43,628
- I don't want to go.
- You must. Mom and Dad will be there.

141
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:03,772
- Do you know you're a knockout?
- You mean "still"?

142
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:11,908
- I mean you're a knockout.
- So are you.

143
00:19:21,712 --> 00:19:23,919
Why don't you shave?

144
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:28,963
- Really?
- Really.

145
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:37,810
- Did you check on Meaghan?
- Yeah, she's asleep.

146
00:19:59,457 --> 00:20:02,492
- Don't, don't, don't.
- Come on.

147
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:08,376
- Honey... it's probably...
- We have an answering machine.

148
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,298
Honey, it's probably Russell.

149
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:15,420
He'll leave a message. He'll leave a
nice, long message. Don't, don't, don't.

150
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:17,797
Come on, honey.

151
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:21,090
Sally Eastman.

152
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:23,469
Russell!

153
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,564
No, we were just talking.

154
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:32,935
We were talking about what a lovely
time we had at dinner with you.

155
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:39,450
You're kidding!
They want to build the house.

156
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:45,865
- Mr Eastman? Is something wrong?
- Edwina. No.

157
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:50,909
- Where's Meaghan?
- Ballet class. Aren't you fetching her?

158
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,586
Oh, God, yes!

159
00:21:00,097 --> 00:21:02,303
Lift up, please.

160
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,551
Pull up.

161
00:21:09,356 --> 00:21:11,562
Watch your music.

162
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,985
Long arm.

163
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,782
There we go. Long in the arm.

164
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:32,244
That's my dad!

165
00:21:32,461 --> 00:21:35,213
And a very nice tight fifth.

166
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,334
We all get on stage,
in front of this director guy.

167
00:21:42,554 --> 00:21:46,801
He's watching all of us.
He picks one girl to do a solo.

168
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:49,139
One, for the real opera?

169
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:51,060
"The Rosenkavalier"
or "The Magic Flute".

170
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:57,230
And Mrs Krask kind of implied
it's between me and Chrissy Taylor.

171
00:21:57,443 --> 00:22:00,942
I can't believe this! That's incredible.

172
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:04,239
Honey, I'm so proud of you.

173
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:10,026
- Go on, finish your sandwich.
- No, that's OK. I'm not hungry.

174
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:13,663
- Go on.
- I had a big lunch.

175
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:16,413
You had a big lunch? What?

176
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,170
An apple.

177
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:28,881
- You know what Dr Lemert said.
- Dancers have to stay skinny.

178
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,467
If you don't watch out you'll be a fainter,
not a dancer.

179
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:38,105
- I'll have to carry you off stage.
- That's not true!

180
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:42,526
Richard says I have a good chance
of getting picked for the corps de ballet.

181
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,235
- Who's Richard?
- Richard Quarry, a friend of Mom's.

182
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:50,742
- He makes lots of money for the opera.
- Really?

183
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:53,453
Is he nice?

184
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:59,408
He's OK. But he makes pancakes
in the shape of animals for breakfast.

185
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:03,209
It's like... Give me a break.

186
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:07,295
For breakfast?

187
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:13,214
Uh-oh.

188
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:15,803
Breakfast?

189
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:20,181
- Sounds pretty serious.
- I don't know. I mean...

190
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:26,190
She's talking about inviting him
to the island for Easter.

191
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:31,945
How's the house coming?

192
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:35,112
- Which one?
- You and Olivia.

193
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:38,910
- That house. It'll start soon.
- My room?

194
00:23:39,123 --> 00:23:42,705
- You have a room in this house?
- I hope so.

195
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:46,915
You've got big windows.
From them you see the ocean.

196
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:52,835
You've got dolphins and whales, just
like I said. You're so pretty. Let's go.

197
00:23:58,057 --> 00:23:59,552
OK.

198
00:24:01,561 --> 00:24:04,133
- Dad?
- Yeah?

199
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:11,274
- Will you come to the island for Easter?
- Get in. We'll talk about it.

200
00:24:27,794 --> 00:24:30,830
Honey! Honey!

201
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:35,542
We have tadpoles, we have frogs,
we have fish.

202
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,760
Oysters! Look at this!

203
00:24:38,971 --> 00:24:44,131
Let's put a flower garden outside the
bedroom window. Roses! Camellias!

204
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:48,396
No! Wildflowers.
We'll put wildflowers everywhere!

205
00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:52,271
The summer nights. Oh, my God!

206
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,944
Hey! Over here!

207
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:10,656
- Hey.
- Hi.

208
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:19,382
- How do you like your view?
- Great. When can you start?

209
00:25:19,593 --> 00:25:25,133
- I think I can start Monday.
- I don't know. With all these rains.

210
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:32,477
I don't want to pour a foundation and
get rain damage before it's enclosed.

211
00:25:33,022 --> 00:25:37,814
- What do you think?
- Yeah, that's probably wise.

212
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,776
- I'd best be going.
- I'll be in touch with you.

213
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,450
- Thanks for coming.
- Nice meeting you.

214
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:00,797
Pappas is a good man. One of the best.

215
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,593
You don't want this house.

216
00:26:11,517 --> 00:26:14,601
What makes you say that?

217
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:20,602
- No rush.
- This isn't as easy as you think.

218
00:26:20,817 --> 00:26:26,274
There are high winds here. It's rainy this
time of the year. It's not an easy site...

219
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:30,487
You build office towers and museums.
This is a little house.

220
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:34,700
Well, I'm actually going to live
in this little house.

221
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:38,246
Come here.

222
00:26:39,377 --> 00:26:43,504
I want it to be right. Really right.

223
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:49,762
- We have all the time in the world.
- You said we'd get started by Easter.

224
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,725
That's not going to happen anyway.

225
00:26:57,644 --> 00:26:59,683
I've got to go to the island.

226
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:03,311
Meaghan asked me.

227
00:27:04,317 --> 00:27:09,026
This is a very difficult time for her.
She needs her father.

228
00:27:23,252 --> 00:27:26,122
You wanted to see me?

229
00:27:28,173 --> 00:27:33,512
Yeah. I'd like to come out to the island
for Easter, if that's OK.

230
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:39,464
- What happened?
- I thought about it. I'd like to be there.

231
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,224
That is, if it doesn't interfere
with anything.

232
00:27:46,107 --> 00:27:48,776
- What do you mean?
- Plans of yours.

233
00:27:49,193 --> 00:27:55,148
- No. It's great. Meaghan will be thrilled.
- Good.

234
00:27:55,366 --> 00:27:58,152
So, Richard, huh?

235
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:00,785
- Who?
- Richard!

236
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:04,661
Pancakes in the shape of animals.
Richard, you know.

237
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:08,041
- He's a friend of the family.
- Does she eat them?

238
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:11,170
- Not usually.
- Good. Glad to hear that.

239
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:14,464
Have we concluded the interrogation?

240
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:24,256
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, all right?

241
00:28:24,476 --> 00:28:29,138
She blurted it out
and I didn't take it very well. It threw me.

242
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:33,725
I should have told you.

243
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:36,269
I'm sorry.

244
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,238
What?

245
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,203
You know what Neal asked,
out of the blue?

246
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:52,878
He asked me what happened to us.
I couldn't remember.

247
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:57,001
- You fell in love with another woman.
- Before that.

248
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:16,650
Look, we don't have to do
this Easter thing, you and me.

249
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:23,193
That's all right. There's still that
shutter that rattles in the wind.

250
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:28,365
- The guest room. I didn't fix that.
- You'd better. It'll be your room.

251
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,087
- Is it your sinuses?
- Yeah.

252
00:29:44,302 --> 00:29:46,710
- You look terrible.
- Thanks.

253
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,716
You probably have a fever.

254
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,764
Sally, I'm all right.

255
00:29:57,148 --> 00:29:59,519
You need a siesta.

256
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:02,485
You still have that hotel room?

257
00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:05,900
Where was that?

258
00:30:06,657 --> 00:30:10,191
It was... Denman Street.

259
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:13,609
Is it nice?

260
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,780
- It's a hotel room.
- Hotel rooms can be nice.

261
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:22,836
No past. No future.

262
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:26,624
Just impersonal.

263
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:38,225
What's a girl have to do
to get a little action around here?

264
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,700
Oh! Where did that come from?

265
00:30:56,871 --> 00:31:00,205
That is not like me, is it?

266
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:07,040
You have a ride tonight to the museum?

267
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:10,339
No thanks. I have a lift.

268
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:12,673
- Pancake man?
- Yeah.

269
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:16,385
- Does he wear an apron?
- You used to be funnier.

270
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:21,008
- I'll hire a writer.
- This isn't such a good idea.

271
00:31:21,228 --> 00:31:27,312
I don't think that we can come here
every day to the same office.

272
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:29,934
You're right. You're fired.

273
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:34,403
That's better.

274
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:49,211
It's my turn, my turn!

275
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,709
I'll tell you the truth.

276
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:56,549
When she first showed up with him,
I was not convinced.

277
00:31:57,261 --> 00:32:01,555
Far from it.
An art student? God help us.

278
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:06,178
But she worked with him and
she straightened him out.

279
00:32:06,395 --> 00:32:09,681
Our daughter has never looked better!

280
00:32:10,274 --> 00:32:12,017
She looks so beautiful.

281
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:19,066
So, now all I want to know is,
where are my grandchildren?

282
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:22,817
- Dad.
- You've had a year. Let's get moving.

283
00:32:23,036 --> 00:32:25,195
I'm exhausted.

284
00:32:25,413 --> 00:32:28,663
Settle down. This is not a roast.

285
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:34,249
We're proud of you.
And we love you both.

286
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,955
Long life!

287
00:32:37,174 --> 00:32:38,585
Long life!

288
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:40,840
I love you, Daddy.

289
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:47,589
Demonstrators in Tehran shouted "Down
wlth America" and "Death to Carter".

290
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:53,052
The actions of Iranian leaders and
the radicals were completely unjustified.

291
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,615
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be mingling.

292
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:13,990
- I think I'm mingled out.
- It doesn't matter. You're a hit.

293
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:19,370
- Tell me. I'm listening.
- Of course you're the most fabulous.

294
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,673
- And you can be so charming.
- Of course.

295
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:26,419
And you're incredibly funny.

296
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:30,137
- Very talented.
- Yes.

297
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:35,510
- I didn't hear "sexually irresistible".
- My grandmother said that.

298
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:43,811
The Raynors want you to build
a new summer cottage for them.

299
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:46,900
- Really?
- Isn't that nice?

300
00:33:47,115 --> 00:33:49,155
Yeah, it's good.

301
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:53,828
Randall Otis wants to redo
his executive offices.

302
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:56,494
God, that's wonderful.

303
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:59,792
And, I'm not sure, but I think...

304
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:03,336
I think we have lunch
with Brian Kennedy.

305
00:34:03,548 --> 00:34:05,587
- Who?
- From the university.

306
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:11,969
- He is the construction committee!
- You're a genius.

307
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:14,220
Great.

308
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:18,267
- No, don't. No.
- Yes.

309
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:21,395
Vincent. Honey.

310
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,024
Come on. There are people downstairs.

311
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,155
You go and lock that door.

312
00:34:30,365 --> 00:34:34,493
He said he wanted grandchildren!
Listen to your father.

313
00:34:34,702 --> 00:34:38,996
Vincent...
God! I don't think he meant tonight.

314
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:44,793
But you be quiet, OK?

315
00:34:45,004 --> 00:34:48,538
I mean it. My parents are downstairs.

316
00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:56,836
I got it. I'll do it, I'll do it.

317
00:35:03,938 --> 00:35:07,022
Don't get your fingers on my dress.

318
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,479
Come on.

319
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:15,157
Kiss me. Kiss me.

320
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:18,446
That's good. Come on, hurry up.

321
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:21,323
Come on.

322
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:25,869
OK, that's good. OK.

323
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:34,884
That's good. It's OK.

324
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:38,422
OK. OK.

325
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:42,683
- My grandmother's downstairs.
- Stay, stay.

326
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:51,305
OK. All right, hurry up.

327
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,738
Look, I'm all wrinkled.

328
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:02,905
Come on down pretty fast, OK?
They're waiting for you.

329
00:36:40,362 --> 00:36:43,862
You sure are a handsome devil.

330
00:36:44,075 --> 00:36:47,159
I mean for an old guy.

331
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,707
Maybe the house isn't such a good
idea. Maybe it's too soon for you.

332
00:36:58,922 --> 00:37:03,050
For us.
Maybe it's a little too complicated.

333
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:07,050
I mean it. And it's OK.

334
00:37:07,263 --> 00:37:09,968
Yes, it is OK.

335
00:37:17,689 --> 00:37:21,390
- What time will you be home?
- Around midnight.

336
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,695
- So late?
- I've got that thing at the museum.

337
00:37:24,905 --> 00:37:28,238
- What thing?
- The reception.

338
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,822
- Your museum?
- Yeah. I told you.

339
00:37:31,036 --> 00:37:33,075
I don't remember.

340
00:37:33,288 --> 00:37:38,993
It's just a dumb thing for the trustees.
They parade me like a trained seal.

341
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,250
- Want me to come?
- No.

342
00:37:41,463 --> 00:37:46,623
I'll just run up there,
make an appearance and get out.

343
00:37:47,468 --> 00:37:50,386
I will be back before midnight.

344
00:37:50,596 --> 00:37:52,838
I love you.

345
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:59,431
You really want the house?

346
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:01,520
Yes.

347
00:38:09,364 --> 00:38:13,492
What's a month? One month?

348
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:17,116
We've got years.

349
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:20,414
120 on the side. 130, 130 now. At 130.

350
00:38:20,624 --> 00:38:23,709
140. 140, 140. At 140. Thank you.

351
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:26,836
And a 150? At 140 in the back.
And 150.

352
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:30,131
150 anywhere? At 150. Thank you.
And 160?

353
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:33,260
160? Thank you. I have the lady. 170?

354
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:37,384
At 160 and 170. You wish to go on 70?
170 now. At 160.

355
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,469
170 I have. And 180? 170 in the back.
180?

356
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:44,220
180? 180 now.
It's against you, ma'am. 180? Yes.

357
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:49,017
180. She comes back. Thank you.
And 190? 180, 190. 190 anywhere?

358
00:38:49,235 --> 00:38:52,319
At 180 dollars.
First, second, third and last...

359
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,658
- 200.
- 200 dollars on the side. New bidder.

360
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,247
At 225?

361
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:07,127
She comes back. And 50? I have 225.

362
00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:12,496
Well worth the value. 50? Yes.
75? At 250. And 75 now?

363
00:39:12,716 --> 00:39:18,054
At 250 dollars. First, second, third.
300 I have. Thank you.

364
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:27,846
- 500.
- 500!

365
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:42,398
Sold! Gentleman on the side.

366
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:45,323
- Cash or charge?
- Charge.

367
00:39:45,538 --> 00:39:51,327
Excuse me. I'm sorry. It's such
an unusual clock. I couldn't resist.

368
00:39:51,585 --> 00:39:55,334
- I was just bidding you up.
- Bidding me up?

369
00:39:58,968 --> 00:40:03,095
- You work for the auctioneer?
- Yeah.

370
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:08,720
- Do you ever get stuck?
- Never.

371
00:40:11,063 --> 00:40:13,518
What if I hadn't come in?

372
00:40:13,731 --> 00:40:16,768
The guy with the sun hat
would go to 350.

373
00:40:16,985 --> 00:40:19,737
I think he was out at 170.

374
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:25,238
Oh. Well...

375
00:40:26,702 --> 00:40:29,109
- Sir?
- Yeah.

376
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:33,492
It's a Congreve clock, actually.

377
00:40:33,709 --> 00:40:38,869
English. Kind of rare bird around here.
You don't see very many.

378
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:40,547
Phone number.

379
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:44,885
Keeps terrible time,
but it's a very beautiful object.

380
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:53,059
There you go.
That's yours, this is mine.

381
00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:07,531
Do you have a place on the island?

382
00:41:07,742 --> 00:41:10,149
- No.
- I didn't think so.

383
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:13,453
- Why is that?
- You're so fair.

384
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:17,707
I try to be.
What did you say your name was?

385
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:19,957
Eastman, Vincent.

386
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:23,705
Goodbye, Mr Eastman.
Enjoy your clock.

387
00:41:23,924 --> 00:41:26,295
This way, ma'am.

388
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:31,800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

389
00:41:48,488 --> 00:41:51,822
I know this is annoying. Have we met?

390
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:55,117
- No.
- You are so familiar.

391
00:41:55,328 --> 00:42:00,322
- I thought I was being rather aloof.
- You are, you are.

392
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:05,701
You know my name now. I thought
maybe at least I could know yours.

393
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:08,627
Olivia Marshak.

394
00:42:09,341 --> 00:42:14,133
Olivia Marshak. Are you the writer?
"Step Magazine"? Really?

395
00:42:14,346 --> 00:42:19,684
I can't believe this! I knew I knew you.
Your picture is on top of the column?

396
00:42:19,893 --> 00:42:24,436
It's so nice meeting you. I have
an incredible visual memory.

397
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:27,732
- Would you like to sit down?
- No, that's OK.

398
00:42:27,942 --> 00:42:33,233
It's really terrific. The magazine comes
to the office. The younger staff like it.

399
00:42:33,448 --> 00:42:35,855
The young people? God bless them.

400
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,940
Can I get you something from the bar?

401
00:42:39,161 --> 00:42:41,699
- Not yet.
- I'll come back.

402
00:42:41,913 --> 00:42:48,663
I remember a great column you did.
We were passing it around the office.

403
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:56,420
It was about how you're always invited
to dinners as the unattached female.

404
00:42:56,636 --> 00:43:02,222
And you would always say no.
You would rather have your solitude.

405
00:43:02,433 --> 00:43:05,138
What did you call it?

406
00:43:05,353 --> 00:43:08,022
"Hell is Other People."

407
00:43:08,814 --> 00:43:10,854
Very good.

408
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:14,018
Is it true?

409
00:43:15,946 --> 00:43:18,401
Would you rather be alone?

410
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:23,071
It depends.

411
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:27,414
- Are you sorry I sat down here?
- Not yet.

412
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:30,834
How about you?

413
00:43:58,028 --> 00:44:01,776
We stole their land,
we decimated their culture.

414
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:04,611
We offered them welfare in exchange.

415
00:44:04,826 --> 00:44:08,276
We wanted to do a building
that would celebrate,

416
00:44:08,495 --> 00:44:14,534
that would reassure them, and us, too,
of the greatness of that culture.

417
00:44:19,298 --> 00:44:22,382
When I started thinking
about this project,

418
00:44:22,592 --> 00:44:26,341
and every project has its own approach,

419
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:32,260
I wanted to get into the minds of the
people who lived here. To try, anyhow.

420
00:44:33,436 --> 00:44:38,596
To feel their relationship with nature.
This extraordinary feeling of divinity

421
00:44:38,816 --> 00:44:43,976
that they had with everything around
them. Nature as a divine church.

422
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:48,692
I'll tell you a secret,
if you promise not to tell anybody.

423
00:44:48,909 --> 00:44:55,622
I think there's something else here
besides concrete, stone and steel,

424
00:44:55,832 --> 00:44:58,288
that's holding this place up.

425
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:05,963
Anyhow, it's here. It's done.
We're very proud of this.

426
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:10,303
Please walk around and enjoy.
You paid for it.

427
00:45:10,513 --> 00:45:13,597
But don't touch anything!

428
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:26,685
- It's beautiful.
- That's real articulate.

429
00:45:26,903 --> 00:45:30,568
- Vincent, it's a triumph!
- Thank you.

430
00:45:30,782 --> 00:45:34,282
- You're very sweet. Thanks.
- Nice to see you.

431
00:45:34,494 --> 00:45:37,032
I'd still rather draw something
than explain it.

432
00:45:37,246 --> 00:45:42,241
What was that class?
A term paper was due...

433
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,536
European History. You were going
to draw the entire French Revolution.

434
00:45:47,756 --> 00:45:51,968
- Me and Delacroix!
- Great work, Vincent.

435
00:45:52,177 --> 00:45:53,505
Thank you.

436
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,307
- What was the professor's name?
- Leudtke. Hans Leudtke.

437
00:45:59,976 --> 00:46:03,262
He had a terrible toupee.
It was over his eyes.

438
00:46:05,356 --> 00:46:08,939
- He had a thing for you.
- He did not.

439
00:46:09,152 --> 00:46:13,363
- Wonderful evening.
- Thank you. You remember Reginald.

440
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:15,814
- Thanks a lot.
- See you Wednesday.

441
00:46:16,033 --> 00:46:19,817
Everyone talked about it.
The guy was a mess.

442
00:46:20,037 --> 00:46:25,956
He broke down when we got married.
Pulled the rug right out from over him.

443
00:46:34,134 --> 00:46:37,584
Come on, you're not leaving.

444
00:46:37,804 --> 00:46:41,753
Pretty soon. I can't do this much longer.

445
00:46:41,974 --> 00:46:44,810
Somebody will talk to you.

446
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:47,889
You have to see Archer before you go.

447
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:51,688
Come on. Please? For me?

448
00:47:05,163 --> 00:47:08,947
- Congratulations. Marvellous building.
- Thank you.

449
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:14,243
I wanted to call you about something.
A new recital hall at the university.

450
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:19,090
- I think you'd be perfect for it.
- I don't think we've met.

451
00:47:24,097 --> 00:47:26,506
Richard Quarry.

452
00:47:28,685 --> 00:47:32,434
- The pancake man...
- Excuse me?

453
00:47:33,774 --> 00:47:36,858
You make pancakes for my daughter.

454
00:47:39,237 --> 00:47:41,693
Oh... yes.

455
00:47:43,283 --> 00:47:45,820
I suppose I do.

456
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,704
She's a lovely girl.

457
00:47:51,915 --> 00:47:55,331
What the hell do you know
about my daughter?

458
00:48:23,278 --> 00:48:27,359
- How did you get here?
- I flew. There's an airport nearby.

459
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:30,659
I thought we could drive home together.

460
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:35,613
- What's the matter? They don't like it?
- They like it.

461
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:39,699
- It's beautiful!
- Yes, it is. Let's get a drink.

462
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:47,463
- Yes, ma'am?
- Red wine.

463
00:48:47,677 --> 00:48:50,214
- And for you, sir?
- Nothing.

464
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:52,885
Club soda.

465
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,061
Thank you.

466
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,936
What's the matter with you?

467
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:14,279
Sally is here. And Meaghan.

468
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:30,046
That's cosy.
Maybe we can all go out for a pizza.

469
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:36,094
- You're drunk.
- It's the little bottles at the airport.

470
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:40,933
Are you trying to hide me?
If so, it's not going to work.

471
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:48,641
- If you'd only told me. It's important...
- An important reception for the trustees.

472
00:49:48,859 --> 00:49:53,272
Meaghan, a trustee?
So young, yet so accomplished.

473
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:55,897
- Let's go.
- Where?

474
00:49:56,117 --> 00:50:01,740
- We're going home.
- No! I want to meet the trustees.

475
00:50:01,956 --> 00:50:04,031
- Stop it.
- I've a better idea.

476
00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:08,247
Do you have one of those
little director's offices here?

477
00:50:08,462 --> 00:50:10,205
Upstairs. Why?

478
00:50:10,422 --> 00:50:14,882
We could lock the door and do it
on the rug. A ceremonial quickie.

479
00:50:15,093 --> 00:50:17,964
Grow up! For Christ's sake, grow up!

480
00:50:18,471 --> 00:50:23,927
OK. I won't make a sound.
Just like Sally.

481
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:27,097
Go to hell.

482
00:50:27,313 --> 00:50:31,855
- As soon as I know how I fit into all this.
- Then come here.

483
00:50:33,944 --> 00:50:39,484
Do you want to know how you fit in?
You don't! You do not fit into this.

484
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:45,820
I work with Sally. We did this project,
and we're very proud of this project.

485
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:51,199
It's not about you, it's about the
museum. Not everything is about you!

486
00:50:51,419 --> 00:50:53,292
Hello.

487
00:51:00,386 --> 00:51:02,592
I'm Sally Eastman.

488
00:51:07,226 --> 00:51:09,895
Sally, this is Olivia Marshak.

489
00:51:10,271 --> 00:51:13,473
- How are you?
- Fine.

490
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:17,481
I read your column.

491
00:51:17,694 --> 00:51:20,980
It's very good. It's very clever.

492
00:51:21,656 --> 00:51:26,816
- Thanks.
- I recognised you from your photo.

493
00:51:27,036 --> 00:51:30,701
- You, too?
- Excuse me?

494
00:51:30,915 --> 00:51:35,042
- It's a passport photo.
- Really?

495
00:51:36,212 --> 00:51:37,836
I like it.

496
00:51:38,047 --> 00:51:43,919
"If you look like your passport photo,
you're not well enough to travel."

497
00:51:46,554 --> 00:51:49,259
- Hi, Meaghan.
- Hi.

498
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:58,977
Well, it's nice to have
met you. At last.

499
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,315
Likewise.

500
00:52:02,528 --> 00:52:04,568
Come on.

501
00:52:05,573 --> 00:52:06,901
All right?

502
00:52:07,115 --> 00:52:08,824
- Yes.
- How about you?

503
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:16,705
I guess that's what you call
a home court advantage.

504
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:02,414
Vincent, I'm sorry.

505
00:53:04,962 --> 00:53:08,830
I got drunk. I got a little crazy.

506
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:13,795
Maybe I suspected they'd be there, and
wanted to see what I was up against.

507
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,050
Do you understand?

508
00:53:17,265 --> 00:53:19,507
I like her.

509
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:23,933
But I can't give you
what you had with them.

510
00:53:24,147 --> 00:53:29,651
Summers on a boat with Meaghan.
16 years.

511
00:53:29,861 --> 00:53:35,021
All that history. We don't have a history.
We can make one.

512
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:39,903
Vincent, I can make you so happy,
if you...

513
00:53:40,996 --> 00:53:44,413
I swore I wasn't going to do this.

514
00:53:48,545 --> 00:53:54,630
Look, it's going to be all right.
We'll build a fire.

515
00:53:56,511 --> 00:54:00,212
- Come on.
- I got to go back to the museum.

516
00:54:02,225 --> 00:54:06,353
- Tonight?
- I have a meeting there in the morning.

517
00:54:15,737 --> 00:54:18,525
You know what?

518
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,110
I think you liked what happened tonight.

519
00:54:24,204 --> 00:54:27,739
Me and Sally, with you in the middle.

520
00:54:31,877 --> 00:54:34,665
Are you getting out?

521
00:54:36,424 --> 00:54:40,208
Yes, I think so.

522
00:55:27,597 --> 00:55:30,052
Watch your head.

523
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,612
Take your coat off. I'll get a towel.

524
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:50,609
There you go.

525
00:55:53,914 --> 00:55:56,831
Nice. Very nice.

526
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,960
- This is nice, isn't it?
- She is a nice boat.

527
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:03,211
I thought so.

528
00:56:03,423 --> 00:56:10,421
She is a Swan 44,
designed by Sparkman and Stephens.

529
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:15,881
About 20 years old. Deck and interior
are teak. Kind of broad in the beam.

530
00:56:16,102 --> 00:56:20,680
I had to look hard for her.
You're a real boat person, I can tell.

531
00:56:23,066 --> 00:56:27,942
My uncle said, "Going on a boat is like
being in jail with a chance of drowning."

532
00:56:29,197 --> 00:56:31,735
I like that one.

533
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:36,617
Ah, yes.

534
00:56:42,252 --> 00:56:43,876
You're married.

535
00:56:49,591 --> 00:56:53,292
- It shows, huh?
- Like a neon sign.

536
00:56:55,472 --> 00:56:57,844
- And you?
- Not any more.

537
00:57:03,438 --> 00:57:05,810
Well, down the hatch.

538
00:57:14,073 --> 00:57:17,739
How long have you been married?

539
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:22,869
Lt'll be 16 years in October.

540
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:26,203
- Any children?
- 13.

541
00:57:26,418 --> 00:57:29,752
- You have 13 children?
- No...

542
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:33,998
No, I have...

543
00:57:35,635 --> 00:57:40,428
I have a little girl who is 13.
Her name is Meaghan.

544
00:57:52,485 --> 00:57:56,317
You want to take me to bed, is that it?

545
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:04,158
Why don't you just say what's on
your mind and share it with me?

546
00:58:04,371 --> 00:58:07,288
Why don't you?

547
00:58:10,043 --> 00:58:15,499
- Why don't we just trade stories?
- I think I've heard yours.

548
00:58:20,928 --> 00:58:24,048
I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this.

549
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:38,478
You're doing fine.
So what happened with the marriage?

550
00:58:44,075 --> 00:58:46,862
We met in Florence.

551
00:58:47,078 --> 00:58:49,865
I was on scholarship.

552
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:56,493
We got married, we had Meaghan,
started a company.

553
00:58:56,754 --> 00:58:59,625
We've been working together
ever since.

554
00:59:00,424 --> 00:59:04,208
- That's it?
- Essentially, yes.

555
00:59:06,888 --> 00:59:09,427
I must have missed something.

556
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:14,392
Me, too.

557
00:59:20,277 --> 00:59:22,648
Shall we go?

558
00:59:24,238 --> 00:59:26,278
No.

559
00:59:28,909 --> 00:59:31,151
I'll have another.

560
01:00:02,274 --> 01:00:04,314
Shit!

561
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:20,950
Bye, guys.
Thanks. See you.

562
01:00:26,964 --> 01:00:28,755
Here.

563
01:00:29,342 --> 01:00:31,381
Thanks.

564
01:00:32,136 --> 01:00:35,054
What'll it be?

565
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:40,849
Bourbon. A glass of water on the side.

566
01:00:41,061 --> 01:00:43,896
And a cup of coffee, please.

567
01:00:44,105 --> 01:00:47,023
- Still raining?
- Yeah.

568
01:00:48,902 --> 01:00:53,528
Can you tell me why we don't all
just move to Arizona?

569
01:00:55,825 --> 01:01:00,617
They say that rainy climates
are good for the complexion.

570
01:01:00,829 --> 01:01:05,456
Well, it's not my skin
that I'm worried about.

571
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,910
It's my sanity.

572
01:01:18,638 --> 01:01:20,216
How long have you known her?

573
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,680
About two months.

574
01:01:26,604 --> 01:01:29,938
- We met in August.
- Do I know her?

575
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:33,683
Her name is Olivia Marshak.

576
01:01:34,445 --> 01:01:38,313
Marshak? Marshak.

577
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:40,406
She's a journalist.

578
01:01:40,618 --> 01:01:43,702
You must have known
something was going on?

579
01:01:43,913 --> 01:01:46,996
I thought you were working late.

580
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:53,163
Are you in love with her? I'm sorry,
isn't that the traditional question?

581
01:01:53,379 --> 01:01:58,586
I say, "Are you in love with her?", and
you say, "I'm confused. I need time."

582
01:01:58,801 --> 01:02:01,886
- And then I respond...
- Look!

583
01:02:02,722 --> 01:02:06,470
- I didn't plan this.
- I believe that.

584
01:02:06,684 --> 01:02:09,850
- What?
- I plan, you create.

585
01:02:10,062 --> 01:02:14,190
Isn't that what this whole relationship
is based on?

586
01:02:16,735 --> 01:02:18,977
- I'm going to a hotel.
- Really?

587
01:02:19,195 --> 01:02:22,980
Now when we're finally
getting to know each other.

588
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:35,661
- Are you all right?
- What do you mean, am I all right?

589
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:40,207
- You're acting a little crazy.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

590
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:44,718
I just said that I love another woman!
I don't care!

591
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:48,594
- I'm leaving you. Do you understand?
- I heard you.

592
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:52,590
- You're amazing.
- And how is that?

593
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,895
Do you ever consider, just maybe,

594
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:59,724
if you felt more upset,
it wouldn't have happened?

595
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:04,818
Don't you get angry at me because you
fuck another woman. It lacks conviction.

596
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:11,824
I'm taking a bath. You will call me
tomorrow and we'll talk this over, OK?

597
01:03:30,096 --> 01:03:31,425
Sally.

598
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,466
Hey, Sally!

599
01:03:38,271 --> 01:03:42,138
Don't move. There's glass on the floor.

600
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:47,269
- I'll help you out.
- Don't touch me.

601
01:03:48,322 --> 01:03:52,071
- Sally, don't move.
- Leave me alone.

602
01:03:52,284 --> 01:03:55,119
Don't you touch me!

603
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:58,955
I don't want you to get hurt. Come.

604
01:04:01,209 --> 01:04:05,752
- I hate you!
- Stop it. Stop it!

605
01:04:06,464 --> 01:04:08,540
Stop it, stop it!

606
01:04:08,758 --> 01:04:11,462
It's all right, it's all right.

607
01:04:11,677 --> 01:04:14,050
It's OK.

608
01:07:35,454 --> 01:07:37,945
I was looking forward to meeting you.

609
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:44,753
Your father has told me a lot about you.
You're taking ballet?

610
01:07:44,962 --> 01:07:46,505
Yeah.

611
01:07:48,383 --> 01:07:53,294
- Do you like it?
- You know I'm studying it!

612
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,550
Let's order.

613
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:09,849
Meaghan, this is not a contest.
I'm not trying to replace anybody.

614
01:08:10,403 --> 01:08:13,607
Not you and not your mother.

615
01:08:13,824 --> 01:08:17,358
I just want to make your father happy.

616
01:08:17,576 --> 01:08:22,737
I can't do that if you're going to fight me.
Do you understand?

617
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:29,038
What do you say?
Will you give it a shot?

618
01:08:37,971 --> 01:08:40,462
Sure. I guess.

619
01:08:43,268 --> 01:08:46,222
I have something for you.

620
01:08:52,902 --> 01:08:57,030
Oh, my God!
Is this really his handwriting?

621
01:08:58,115 --> 01:08:59,858
What does it say?

622
01:09:00,075 --> 01:09:03,776
"To Meaghan, Keep dancing.
Mikhail Baryshnikov."

623
01:09:03,996 --> 01:09:05,573
Where did you find this?

624
01:09:05,789 --> 01:09:08,743
I interviewed him.
Who do you think you're dealing with?

625
01:11:23,753 --> 01:11:27,537
Mister, you want a sweet roll?

626
01:11:29,592 --> 01:11:32,048
That's for me?

627
01:11:32,261 --> 01:11:34,300
Well...

628
01:11:37,058 --> 01:11:39,382
Thank you.

629
01:11:40,227 --> 01:11:43,762
Aren't you going to eat it?

630
01:11:44,106 --> 01:11:45,765
Well...

631
01:11:56,952 --> 01:12:02,159
Yes! This is it. This is the one
I was looking for. Thank you.

632
01:12:02,957 --> 01:12:06,041
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

633
01:12:17,178 --> 01:12:21,176
- Looks like more rain.
- Yeah.

634
01:12:24,436 --> 01:12:27,306
You lost?

635
01:12:30,233 --> 01:12:32,106
No.

636
01:12:36,989 --> 01:12:39,528
Grandchild?

637
01:12:40,451 --> 01:12:42,988
Beautiful. Really beautiful.

638
01:12:44,705 --> 01:12:47,955
Grandpa, come on. It's late.

639
01:13:17,236 --> 01:13:21,363
Please deposlt 75 cents
for the next three minutes.

640
01:13:30,331 --> 01:13:33,119
Hi. 6-7-2-3.

641
01:13:33,793 --> 01:13:37,493
- I'm not in. You know what to do.
- Hi.

642
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:41,580
It's me.
I was just driving around and...

643
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:46,296
There was this guy.
He was delivering milk.

644
01:13:46,513 --> 01:13:51,555
He had this most incredible little girl
with red hair!

645
01:13:51,768 --> 01:13:57,142
She had red hair and these eyes were...
She reminded me of you, and...

646
01:13:59,109 --> 01:14:03,735
Something happened and it clicked.
Everything came together and I...

647
01:14:03,946 --> 01:14:09,450
I don't want to lose you! I can't lose you.
I want to be with you. So let's just do it.

648
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:15,865
Let's get married. I want kids, a family,
I want the house, the whole thing!

649
01:14:17,251 --> 01:14:20,834
This is what I want you to do.
Listen to me.

650
01:14:21,047 --> 01:14:24,746
I want you to drive
up to the Bedford Inn.

651
01:14:24,966 --> 01:14:31,005
It's two miles north of the museum.
Wait for me there. Promise to do that!

652
01:14:32,766 --> 01:14:39,219
I was wrong. It is about you! Everything
is about you. Always was. Only you.

653
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:43,105
What else?

654
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:46,483
Marry me! I said that already.

655
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:51,571
It's about... It's 8.15. I look like shit.

656
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:57,448
I'm crazy about you.
I'm always going to be crazy about you.

657
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:03,413
By the way, this is Vincent.
Vincent Eastman.

658
01:15:05,338 --> 01:15:09,206
Good God. Yes!

659
01:15:28,777 --> 01:15:31,694
Two. Second word. Second word is...

660
01:15:31,905 --> 01:15:35,108
...tushy! A really good tushy!

661
01:15:35,325 --> 01:15:39,239
- No!
- A... A... Tail!

662
01:15:39,453 --> 01:15:42,739
A tale! A tale of something, something...

663
01:15:42,957 --> 01:15:47,085
Historical novel, five words.
Before, after, "V", Victory.

664
01:15:47,295 --> 01:15:49,453
Vincent, eyes, two.

665
01:15:49,672 --> 01:15:54,832
Two, yes! A Tale of Two... something.
OK. Historical novel.

666
01:15:55,052 --> 01:15:57,721
- Fourth word is...
- I can't believe you!

667
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:01,345
Don't say anything!
I can do it. I swear.

668
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:04,179
Give it to me.
Come on. Go, go, go.

669
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:07,267
Sounds like...

670
01:16:07,481 --> 01:16:11,394
...titties! "A Tale of Two Titties"!

671
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:15,728
I never read that.
"A Tale of Two Titties"?

672
01:16:57,569 --> 01:17:01,152
The other day I met a bear

673
01:17:01,365 --> 01:17:04,650
Up in the woods, away up there.

674
01:17:19,048 --> 01:17:20,542
We're stuck!

675
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:27,469
- Start it.
- I'm trying. It must be the battery.

676
01:17:28,432 --> 01:17:29,974
Oh, God!

677
01:19:10,028 --> 01:19:12,519
- Are you OK?
- I think so.

678
01:19:12,739 --> 01:19:15,657
He bounced off this truck.
Must be down the road.

679
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:19,118
Bobby, where are you going?

680
01:19:19,329 --> 01:19:22,744
- Bobby, come here!
- Look out for that truck!

681
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:30,536
- There he is.
- Stay here.

682
01:19:31,841 --> 01:19:35,424
Patty, see if this guy's got a CB.
Call an ambulance.

683
01:19:36,845 --> 01:19:39,550
- What's the problem?
- Accident. Do you have a CB?

684
01:19:39,764 --> 01:19:42,719
- Call an ambulance.
- Anybody copy? Over.

685
01:19:43,477 --> 01:19:45,219
Why did you stop?

686
01:19:45,437 --> 01:19:47,928
- I stalled.
- You forced him off the road.

687
01:19:48,148 --> 01:19:53,355
I didn't! He was doing a hundred.
It all happened in a couple of seconds!

688
01:20:19,011 --> 01:20:24,301
Funny, I don't hurt anywhere.
My mind's functioning.

689
01:20:24,516 --> 01:20:30,803
My name is Vincent Eastman.
I'm 42 years old. I live at...

690
01:20:32,398 --> 01:20:33,976
I live at...

691
01:20:34,192 --> 01:20:38,188
- Yes, Vincent, where do you live?
- I want to know where you live.

692
01:20:38,403 --> 01:20:40,977
Pull it open!

693
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:47,911
I'll hold his head. Grab his shoulders.
You grab his legs. Let's get him out.

694
01:20:48,121 --> 01:20:52,035
Watch out for the log.
Don't jiggle him around.

695
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:58,624
Easy. Put him down easy.
Put him down gently, very gently.

696
01:20:58,839 --> 01:21:02,789
- Is he bad?
- I don't think so. His eyes are open.

697
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:05,466
He's probably in shock.

698
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:08,217
Bobby, get that blanket from the van.

699
01:21:08,432 --> 01:21:11,267
I just need to rest for a while.

700
01:21:12,895 --> 01:21:17,722
I've got to call Olivia.
Tell her I'm going to be late.

701
01:21:49,805 --> 01:21:55,226
Hi. 6-7-2-3.
I'm not in. You know what to do.

702
01:21:55,435 --> 01:21:59,848
Hi. It's me.
I wasjust driving around and...

703
01:22:00,065 --> 01:22:04,193
There was this guy delivering milk.
He had a little girl...

704
01:22:04,402 --> 01:22:07,770
A most incredible little girl wlth red hair!

705
01:22:50,112 --> 01:22:53,777
- What have we got?
- A 42-year-old male, Vincent Eastman.

706
01:22:53,991 --> 01:22:56,232
- A roll-over MVA.
- Seat belt on?

707
01:22:56,451 --> 01:22:59,618
Yes. He was extricated
by passers-by.

708
01:23:02,123 --> 01:23:05,456
I propose a toast
to the bride and groom.

709
01:23:05,668 --> 01:23:09,880
May they live a long, happy,
healthy and prosperous life!

710
01:23:47,917 --> 01:23:50,586
- Responsive?
- Not appropriately.

711
01:23:50,795 --> 01:23:52,834
- His GCS?
- About ten.

712
01:23:53,046 --> 01:23:55,584
- Allergies?
- I don't know.

713
01:23:55,799 --> 01:23:58,800
The RCMP are notifying his family.

714
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:03,138
Your client wants top quality material.
Where do I get that?

715
01:24:03,348 --> 01:24:07,476
- There's a call for Vincent.
- He's not here yet, so take a message.

716
01:24:07,686 --> 01:24:11,634
About him. They asked
if this was his place of business.

717
01:24:11,856 --> 01:24:16,434
- Who did?
- The Highway Police. On one.

718
01:24:23,325 --> 01:24:26,741
- What was his pressure?
- A hundred by palp.

719
01:24:26,953 --> 01:24:32,457
- Right pupil is dilated. Must intubate.
- I need neurosurgical and respiratory.

720
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:37,494
- Let's draw some trauma bloodwork.
- Air entry equal bilaterally.

721
01:24:37,713 --> 01:24:40,750
Sinus tach 120. Pressure 144 and 94.

722
01:24:40,967 --> 01:24:43,885
5 Versad,100 Fentanyl and 120 Lido.

723
01:24:57,274 --> 01:25:04,439
There's a large haematoma in the right
frontal lobe. Let's get him to the OR.

724
01:25:32,933 --> 01:25:35,637
- How old are these?
- 20 minutes.

725
01:25:35,852 --> 01:25:38,936
- Is he responsive?
- Not really. Right pupil is dilated.

726
01:25:39,147 --> 01:25:43,441
Has he been prepped? We'll relieve
the pressure. How old is he?

727
01:25:43,651 --> 01:25:44,980
- 42.
- Good shape?

728
01:25:45,194 --> 01:25:49,690
- Better than me.
- No reason he can't handle it. Let's go.

729
01:25:55,871 --> 01:26:00,118
- Officer, can I go up on the shoulder?
- In a minute, ma'am.

730
01:26:02,335 --> 01:26:06,250
- What happened?
- Stay off the road, please.

731
01:26:11,469 --> 01:26:16,629
- Where's the man who was in that car?
- Local hospital in Abbotsford.

732
01:26:22,271 --> 01:26:24,429
Hey, lady!

733
01:26:28,318 --> 01:26:33,229
- Can I get you something?
- I'm OK. Thank you.

734
01:26:42,832 --> 01:26:45,537
I'll see if there's any news.

735
01:26:50,756 --> 01:26:57,293
- What's this guy do?
- I don't know. His name is Eastman...

736
01:26:57,513 --> 01:26:59,552
- Vincent Eastman?
- Yes.

737
01:26:59,765 --> 01:27:02,137
He's an architect.

738
01:27:03,102 --> 01:27:06,435
Good. Looks good. Looks really good.

739
01:27:07,397 --> 01:27:09,769
- We can close.
- He's going flat.

740
01:27:13,945 --> 01:27:16,483
Hey.

741
01:27:40,554 --> 01:27:43,223
- You didn't open it, did you?
- What?

742
01:27:43,431 --> 01:27:45,887
- The letter.
- What letter?

743
01:27:47,143 --> 01:27:51,188
I didn't mail it. I never mailed it!

744
01:27:51,398 --> 01:27:54,314
What didn't you mail?

745
01:29:00,088 --> 01:29:04,001
I'll talk to them downstairs,
see what has to be done.

746
01:29:07,553 --> 01:29:09,924
I'll phone for a taxi.

747
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:20,052
I have to call Meaghan.

748
01:29:23,234 --> 01:29:26,319
Tell her we'll be late.

749
01:29:26,529 --> 01:29:30,396
- I'll do it.
- Just tell her we'll be late.

750
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:55,009
Mrs Eastman?

751
01:31:15,632 --> 01:31:19,582
- Where can I find a Vincent Eastman?
- Just a minute.

752
01:31:23,557 --> 01:31:25,217
Vincent Eastman?

753
01:32:09,266 --> 01:32:11,972
Could you excuse me?

754
01:32:20,318 --> 01:32:22,228
I'm sorry.

755
01:32:39,879 --> 01:32:45,169
He didn't say anything.
We both got here too late.

756
01:32:55,727 --> 01:32:59,677
How did you happen to be up here?

757
01:33:02,942 --> 01:33:08,363
I was going to see the museum again,
and saw the car pulled up on the road.

758
01:33:11,868 --> 01:33:13,943
Well...

759
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,365
Goodbye, then.
