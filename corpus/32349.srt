Hello, Cleavers.

39
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,131
Hello,June.

40
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:13,573
Hello, Ward.

41
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:16,407
Oh, I see Eddie Haskell is here.

42
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:21,181
I'm so proud.
My son, the delivery boy.

43
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,515
Your mom's birthday's coming up.

44
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:25,645
What areyou gonna steal
for her this year?

45
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:29,123
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Ma, what doyou want?

46
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:31,956
- Surprise me.
- I will!

47
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:36,397
Pestario, you'rejust
a common hustler.

48
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:41,332
There is nothing common
about the way I dance!

49
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:44,869
Shall we?

50
00:03:55,285 --> 00:03:56,752
Mom!

51
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,116
Great.

52
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:01,020
That was nasty.
Look at the time.

53
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,584
So long, my family. I must go to work.
Love, peace and chicken grease.

54
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:14,866
Good morning, Pestario.

55
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,808
Mr. Shank, we've been searching
for hours.

56
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:35,290
No one in this neighborhood
will fulfill our needs.

57
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,826
Perhaps we should return home?

58
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:39,657
You're too impatient, Leo.

59
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:42,391
A good hunter must always remember...

60
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:46,731
the most challenging prey is often
the most difficult to find.

61
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:57,777
Father Shillelagh.
How areyour Blarney stones?

62
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:04,916
I wanted to thankyou personally
for helping at the church bazaar.

63
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:08,151
- It was bizarre, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.

64
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,421
You know, your booth
made more money than any other.

65
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:13,462
What can I say?

66
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:17,397
It was impossible to knock down
those milk bottles.

67
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:20,527
You don't suppose
it was divine intervention?

68
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:22,571
Father, ifthis is the way
you keep secrets...

69
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,302
I'm gonna save myjuicy confessions
for Father Garcia.

70
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:30,437
I'll sail away now. Lucky Charms,
they're magically delicious!

71
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,447
Bless you, my son.

72
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:34,778
I think.

73
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:37,718
Children! Such carefree exuberance.

74
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:40,187
Such pure innocence at play.

75
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,920
Those little runts.
I'll teach 'em.

76
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:49,158
Hey, moron, we need one more
for basketball.

77
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:52,030
You're with the fat loser-boy.

78
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:56,435
- Why do they call you fat loser-boy?
- I think because I'm fat and neverwin.

79
00:05:56,506 --> 00:06:00,374
We're gonna change that.
The part about neverwinning.

80
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,640
Betyour lunches.
First point wins.

81
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:10,318
All right, you son ofa freak,
no fouls, no calls, no outs. Check.

82
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:11,819
Sucker!

83
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:43,611
What? It's all your fault! Ifyou were
a good player, maybe we would've won.

84
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:47,622
We won! We won!
Give meyour lunches.

85
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,023
That'll teach you a lesson.
Get outta here!

86
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:56,328
Don't worry, they'll never call you
a loser again.

87
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,594
Thanks, mister.

88
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,831
Hey, mister, wait a minute.
I'm stuck.

89
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:11,610
- Is that the Mack Daddy pimp?
- What's up?

90
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,117
- What's up?
- Lunch is on me, freaks.

91
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:20,178
So where is my super-scam
shell game apparatus?

92
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,850
Pest, don't doubt me.
We got it.

93
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,391
Excellent, man.
This scam is foolproof.

94
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:31,661
I'm gonna be the King ofCorruption.
The Duke of Deception.

95
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:36,330
Whoa. Pest, that's whatyou say
about all your scams.

96
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:41,365
- What aboutyour bets with the mob?
- Yeah. You owe them $50,000.

97
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:43,378
Areyou guys my accountants?

98
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:47,507
For God's sake, have a little faith
in the Pest. A little faith.

99
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,881
I got all my bases covered.
I got contingency plans.

100
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:53,217
Pest. All we're saying is that...

101
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:55,519
this scamming thing's dangerous.

102
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:59,391
All right. Ifit will make my bestest
offriends feel better...

103
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:04,900
I'm going to promise I'm never
going to scam again as long as I live.

104
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,901
That would be good.

105
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:10,132
-I'm proud ofyou.
-We can stop getting you out oftrouble.

106
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:15,371
The key to this scam
is to convince people I am blind.

107
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,545
You never learn.

108
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:24,916
WelCome to the festivalofMiami.

109
00:08:48,477 --> 00:08:51,469
These people are all so teeny!

110
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,709
There must be
a worthy candidate here.

111
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:03,487
Pest, look, there's Xantha.

112
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,288
Hey, baby! Hey, baby!

113
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:07,329
We'll catch up toyou later.

114
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:11,329
Hey, baby.
How's my Nubian bucket oflove?

115
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,664
My ebony delight,
myAfricanicus romanticus.

116
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:16,398
Where was your sorry Latin buttocks
last night?

117
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,667
Baby, easywith the nagging.

118
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:21,266
You missed dinnerwith my parents!

119
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:25,405
Yeah! You missed dinner
with her parents last night, loser!

120
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:29,414
Doyou mind ifI talk
to my girlfriend alone?

121
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,010
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of Malaria.

122
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,352
- Anything?
- Anything!

123
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:37,517
Fine. Malaria's got mossy teeth
and a fat butt!

124
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:40,659
Thesejeans make me look fat.

125
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,325
No, Malaria.
Your fat butt makes you look fat.

126
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,334
Baby, I'm sorry.

127
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:49,200
There's nothing more I want to do
than be with my girlfriend's parents.

128
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:52,605
Let's reschedule a site for tomorrow.
Huh, curly locks?

129
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,939
- Can't.
- Why?

130
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:04,284
Baby, what a dufus! What a freak!
I totally forgot--

131
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,014
Forget it. I'm outta here.

132
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:08,784
Xantha-poo, come on, baby.

133
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,826
I'll skip my previous commitment.

134
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,361
Really?
You'll come to dinner?

135
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:17,229
Absofreakinglutely. I'll makeyour
parents love me and ask me to marryyou.

136
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,530
- How?
- I'll tell 'em you're pregnant.

137
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,661
- What?
- He'll tell 'em you're pregnant.

138
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:24,433
Pest-man, we gotta go. Sorry.

139
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:26,441
Love, peace and chicken grease.

140
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:27,942
Bye, honey.

141
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,638
You're pregnant?

142
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,116
Step right up.

143
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:45,558
Money is flying out ofmy pocket.
Play the coconut shell game.

144
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:47,562
There's a winner born every minute.

145
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,861
I got $20 that says
I can find that ball.

146
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,060
Okay, people, we've got a taker.

147
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:58,038
Cross my hand, I fool the rich man,
poor man, but not the policeman.

148
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:03,511
Which shell is it under?
You must tell me because I'm blind.

149
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:07,714
Soccer boy, come here.
Yeah, you.

150
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,013
- Oh, thereyou are.
- How'd you catch that ball?

151
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,419
Telepathy. You lose one sense,
you gain another.

152
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:16,720
- How'd you know I was male?
- I could hearyour gonads shaking.

153
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,420
You should wear more support, shorty.

154
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,227
Maybe, maybe.
Yeah, that's more like it.

155
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:30,103
That is the specimen I want.

156
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:33,869
Find out about him, and I'll make
the necessary preparations.

157
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,672
Yes, Mr. Shank.

158
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:41,116
Oh! What a pathetic choice.

159
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:45,353
Which shell is it under?

160
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,787
Sorry, sucker, you lose.

161
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,654
No, you lose, brah!

162
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:51,920
Did I hear something fall?

163
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:53,552
Knock, knock. Who's there?

164
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,790
We work forAngus.
Areyou Pest Vargas?

165
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,799
Areyou the doctor?

166
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:00,631
Oh, my, Grandma,
what large pores you have.

167
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:02,933
Definitely not a plastic surgeon.

168
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,667
Oh, my God, you're hideous.
Repulsive, even!

169
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:08,403
You have a lump!
You poor misshapen creature!

170
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,037
We can profit from your misfortune.

171
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:14,947
For $1 , take a picture
with Elephant Man in a kilt!

172
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:16,279
Get him!

173
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,817
Do something! You know karate!

174
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:25,626
Angus wants his money.

175
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:27,992
You wouldn't hit a blind man,
would you?

176
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:31,992
How doyou feel about asthmatics?
I can't breathe!

177
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,104
Emotionally-challenged people?

178
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:42,171
What about epileptics?
Hold my tongue!

179
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:46,237
- Get 'em!
- You guys are in trouble now.

180
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:49,443
- Chubby and I will take care ofthem!
- Chubby and I?

181
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:53,547
Let's air our differences, fellas.

182
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,147
My favorite delivery boy.

183
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,157
What happened toyou?
You late!

184
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:36,790
Me loveyou long time.

185
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:39,994
Wait. Why I don't understand
any ofyour Chinese?

186
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:44,730
I from south. Different dialect.
Right? Everybody know that.

187
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:47,708
So am I. I am from south, too.

188
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:50,870
But I from far, far, far south!

189
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:52,880
Eat some grits, y'all.

190
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:54,882
Whereveryou come from,
you late for last time.

191
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,614
You don't look Chinese. You look like
Moe from Three Stooges. You're fired.

192
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:04,625
Please, give me another chance!
I'll never do it again, I promise.

193
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:08,026
You don't know the troubles I've seen!
My grandmother's sick.

194
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,725
I've got a good excuse this time.
Listen.

195
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,700
I was taking a walkwith my pet dog--

196
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,033
Duck. My duck!

197
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,403
When he ranned offon me,
I was about to--

198
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:21,136
Oh, my God!

199
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,442
Quacky! Quacky!
What have they dided toyou?

200
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:28,972
- Which one is he?
- I don't know.

201
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:32,214
They all look the same!

202
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:38,058
I'll have to call my lawyer
and tell him I can't find Quacky.

203
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,560
Lawyer?

204
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:44,555
This must be Quacky,
with that sweet little smile.

205
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,066
Gimme that!

206
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:50,265
Poor little Quacky. Don't worry.
I'll buryyou in France likeyou wanted.

207
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,672
- You kill Quacky?
- No! I, I might have.

208
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:57,143
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

209
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:59,738
I loved little Quacky.

210
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,646
- Mr. Cheung?
- Yes?

211
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:03,685
- Can I talk toyou?
- Yes.

212
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:06,983
Can I talk toyou over here?
Over here?

213
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:09,581
- Over here?
- Okay.

214
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,650
- Can I useyour phone?
- You're not calling your lawyer?

215
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:14,161
Notyet.

216
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,631
First I have to call my family
and tell them about--

217
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,895
About Quacky.

218
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:22,164
Yes, ofcourse, ofcourse.

219
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:25,503
Don't worry. Anything you need,
just let me know.

220
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:28,543
- Okay, there is one thing.
- Yes?

221
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:32,138
Quacky always wanted
to be served extra-crispy.

222
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,148
- Could you do that?
- No problem.

223
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:37,845
No MSG? An extra order ofrice?
Thankyou.

224
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,617
You're verywelcome. Don't worry.
I take care ofyou.

225
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,851
You're wonderful.
Really.

226
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,202
Hello.

227
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:58,968
Angusie?

228
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:03,608
You rapscallion!
You naughty man, you!

229
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,207
I'm hurted you sent ruffians after me.
I was gonna surpriseyou with a check!

230
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:10,582
Listen. You've owed $50,000
for three weeks!

231
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:14,054
You'd show more respect
ifwe were the Italian mob.

232
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:15,886
Don't start again.

233
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,552
People don't take us seriously
because we're Scottish.

234
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:23,220
People will take us seriously
when they see what we do toyou.

235
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:27,030
Angusie, homeinsky!
All I need is time.

236
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:28,694
What is today?

237
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:31,171
The first day ofthe rest
ofour lives?

238
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:33,903
Sean Connery's birthday?

239
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:36,035
Sean Connery's birthday?

240
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:50,150
Listen. Today is Monday.

241
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:53,592
I want the moneyWednesday
or I'll kill your family.

242
00:16:53,662 --> 00:16:56,290
How 'bout Thursday,
andyoujust take outa Cousin?

243
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:59,391
Oh, bad connection.

244
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:02,699
I bring you the cash--
I can't--

245
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,102
Whatever.

246
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:09,268
Extra-crispy.
Just likeyou wanted.

247
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:11,643
My poor Quacky.

248
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:16,544
Poor Quacky.
Can I get extra plum sauce?

249
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:20,577
You have no time.
You have delivery to do! Go! Hurry!

250
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:22,385
Plum sauce!

251
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,962
Soon Ishallreturn...

252
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,974
to the glorious dank splendor
ofthe homeland...

253
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:44,035
and be away from
all this nauseating pastel.

254
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:46,479
Excuse me.

255
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:48,778
Your Chinese food has arrived.

256
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:50,785
Yummy! Where?

257
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,949
Got it, got it, got it!

258
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:57,958
What is that?

259
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:01,359
That's the oneyou requested.
The blind Latino.

260
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,389
I most certainly did not!
I wanted the athletic Latino!

261
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:09,335
- Butyou pointed at him.
- Whywould I pick a blind man?

262
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:14,308
Sir, he's not really blind.
He's a scam artist.

263
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:16,537
A very fast and agile one.

264
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:22,306
Mr. Vargas here runs numbers out ofhis
Chinese restaurant, but unfortunately...

265
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:24,784
some ofhis own bets
turned sour.

266
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,186
- How sour?
- He owes the Scottish mob $50,000.

267
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:31,351
I didn't know there was
a Scottish mob!

268
00:18:31,427 --> 00:18:33,861
Ifhe doesn't pay in two days,
they'll kill him.

269
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:54,476
- Hello!
- Hi!

270
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,509
Just doing our MSG test.
Everything seems to pass inspection.

271
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:00,646
That's $52.23 for the food...

272
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:04,556
$1 00 delivery charge 'cause
we don't normally come out here.

273
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:07,493
Why is that?
You afraid ofwhite people?

274
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:12,733
'Causeyou all carry diseases
my people don't have immunities for.

275
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:15,668
Perhaps you'rejust being paranoid.

276
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,671
Could you back off?

277
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,573
You spit when you talk.
I'm susceptible to airborne syphilises.

278
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:23,770
'' Pest.'' Is thatyour name...

279
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:26,178
or a personality trait?

280
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,876
My real name is
Pestario Rivera Garcia Espinoza...

281
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:32,045
Juan Marcos Neruda Salsa Picante Vargas.

282
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,749
Butyou can call me Pestario.
Pest, for shorter.

283
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:37,257
Now we're even.

284
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:41,922
What is a Latin boy doing
delivering Chinese food?

285
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:43,589
Chinese food?

286
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,526
Oh, my God!

287
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,231
The MSG, the chopsticks,
the disappearing dogs!

288
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:53,900
Now it all makes sense. And I thought
theywere eccentric Mexicans.

289
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:57,241
What a fool!
What a sucker-butt!

290
00:19:57,312 --> 00:20:01,408
Oh, a hot wench!
Yeah, baby!

291
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,075
Mywife!

292
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:05,051
Oops! I'm bad.

293
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,382
Sorry.

294
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,448
- I sawyou earlier today on the street.
- You did?

295
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:15,259
You probably didn't see me
becauseyou were blind at the time.

296
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,426
Soyou unearthed my horrible secret.

297
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,435
I am blind! I am!

298
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:23,528
I am blind!

299
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,131
I've been blind
to other people's faults.

300
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:30,667
Please don't tell! I was going
to become dumpling boy next week.

301
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:34,807
Why isn't a smart boy likeyou...

302
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,350
in college?

303
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:38,443
It's painful to discuss.

304
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,114
I hit puberty in the first grade,
and there's only so many times...

305
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:45,649
a seven-year-old can be called
''fire hose'' before he cracks.

306
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:51,256
That's really too bad because
my family provides...

307
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,736
a $50,000 cash scholarship...

308
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:57,772
to minority students,
and I thought--

309
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,773
- $50,000?
- Yeah.

310
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,332
- $50,000?
- Yup, that's it.

311
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:05,141
Look at that.
Will you touch it?

312
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:08,512
The fire hose is gone!
It's a miracle.

313
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:12,350
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
I want to learn! I want to go to school!

314
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:13,911
- You do?
- Yes.

315
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:16,981
Good! I'm so glad you're so eager!

316
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:19,425
Let us celebrate, all right?

317
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:21,155
Here.

318
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:26,724
Ofcourse I have to administer
a few small tests beforeyou qualify.

319
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:28,394
Tests?

320
00:21:30,906 --> 00:21:33,704
Hey, can I get one ofthese tables
for my dorm room?

321
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:37,336
Turn it up!
This is fun. Come on.

322
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:38,970
All right...

323
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,345
crank it up.

324
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:45,285
Yeah!

325
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:52,393
Wait a minute.

326
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:54,395
I don't feel so well.

327
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:55,555
I feel--

328
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:06,306
You will do as many repetitions
as you can manage in one minute. Go!

329
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,243
One.

330
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:11,574
Ready?

331
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:19,050
I wasn't ready.
Try again.

332
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:24,515
Try one more time.

333
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:40,470
He's the worst candidate
we have ever had.

334
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:46,874
I will showyou the shot that won me
the reform school championship...

335
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,416
and the tag ''8-Ball Kid.''

336
00:22:53,388 --> 00:22:56,585
I'm sorry.
I'm awful sorry.

337
00:22:56,658 --> 00:23:00,321
But I knowyou don't care
becauseyou Germans are the greatest!

338
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:03,262
Next time somebody says Germans
are humorless people...

339
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:06,129
I'm gonna tell them to come
to this house.

340
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:07,691
I must tell you--

341
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:10,329
Soyou started a few wars,
all right?

342
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:13,738
Actually, you started everywar.
It's not likeyou everwon one!

343
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:17,745
We kicked France's ass.

344
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,373
Please! Who doesn't, right?

345
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:22,610
Your scores were so abysmal that--

346
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:25,653
And yourwomen!
Soyou dig fat chicks.

347
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:28,246
What do the rest ofus care?
We don't have to touch them.

348
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:33,124
It's like riding a moped. It's fun
till your friends catch you doing it.

349
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:34,628
You failed!

350
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:37,426
You lost the scholarship.
You can't go.

351
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,490
Stop repeating what I'm saying.

352
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:41,331
I mean it!

353
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,973
All right, okay!

354
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:50,410
You're the ideal candidate
for the scholarship.

355
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,052
I am? I am? Oh, snap! Oh,joy!

356
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:02,716
Get stupid. Get ooh-eh! Get eh-eh.

357
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:10,427
I can't think ofanything I would rather
do before returning to the homeland...

358
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:13,332
than ridding the earth
ofthis creature!

359
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,004
Go get the contract.

360
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:23,977
Time to sign the contract.

361
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,412
Sign there on the dotted line.
Here.

362
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:34,381
I took a legal correspondence course
and I'm only two credits away.

363
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:37,823
What's all this stuff
about maiming and death?

364
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,485
Legal mumbojumbo.

365
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,960
All right.

366
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:42,462
Just sign.

367
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:47,492
What's this about ''I waive
my legal rights'' and whatnot?

368
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,596
Some kid sued us lastyear over
a stubbed toe, so we had to add it.

369
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:53,903
-Just sign.
- All right.

370
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,434
What's this about--

371
00:24:56,511 --> 00:25:00,345
- Soyou don't want the $50,000.
- I do want it!

372
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,508
- College is a big commitment.
- I'll be committed.

373
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,519
- We'll give it to someone else.
- Give it to me.

374
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,248
- I want it!
- Forget it!

375
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:09,347
Perhaps a toast?

376
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:16,626
I'm in like sin.

377
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:20,725
Now, we have a little tradition.

378
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:25,762
All the winnersjoin me for a little
gentlemanly hunt on my private island.

379
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:27,206
Goody. What'll we hunt?

380
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,436
- Deer.
- Goose.

381
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:31,342
- Goose.
- Deer.

382
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:32,311
Deergoose.

383
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,972
Ja. Deergoose.

384
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,279
We hunt a deergoose.
It's--

385
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:38,717
- Indigenous.
- Indigenous to my island.

386
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,887
To the hunt!

387
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:48,654
Sorry.

388
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:51,464
Hurry up!

389
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:54,093
I can't wait to bag me a deergoose!

390
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:58,868
I hear the meat's a delicacy.
Nobody fricassees like I fricassee.

391
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:05,407
- I'm going to kill him now!
- Remember, thejoy ofthe hunt.

392
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,677
- Can I fly it?
- No, sit down and be quiet.

393
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,684
You can't talk to me like that.

394
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:13,243
You gotta keep the concentration
for the pilot.

395
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,255
He's the pilot?

396
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:31,839
23,099bottles ofbeeron the wall

397
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:35,741
23,099bottles ofbeeron the wall
Take one down, passitaround--

398
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,472
- There's the island.
- We made it!

399
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:40,878
At last! We're there!

400
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,918
Soyou'll let me fly? Come on!

401
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:47,512
There's so many buttons.
How doyou know which one's the one?

402
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:52,620
YouCan Change forthehunt
in thestudy.

403
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,321
Thankyou.

404
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:56,956
Try not to break anything.

405
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:01,497
''The United States ofGermany.''

406
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:03,537
Somebody's a sore loser.

407
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,201
Books! I love to read.

408
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:17,145
''The Rise and Fall
ofThe Third Reich.''

409
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,186
'' Mein Kampf.''

410
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:21,449
''Sex Be Nimble,
Sex Be Quick.''

411
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:34,761
You speak German?

412
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:42,599
You're the new scholarship student.

413
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:47,910
-I'm here for the hunt, then to Harvard.
-You really believe that?

414
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:50,474
I would settle forYale, but--

415
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:52,747
I love Boston in the spring.

416
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:56,222
Rowing on the Charles.
Gathering leaves in the quad.

417
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,724
The colorwars.

418
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:00,226
Norman, is thatyou?

419
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:03,128
My father tells you you're going
to college and you believe him?

420
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:06,292
Oh, snap. You're ShankJunior, huh?

421
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:09,528
My name is Himmel.

422
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:13,140
I mean, hi, Himmel.

423
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,972
Your father seems like a great guy
for a disturbed individual.

424
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:18,035
No offense.
But I trust him.

425
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,776
What makes you think he'd tell you
the truth when I am his own son...

426
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,375
and he's been lying to me
his entire life?

427
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:31,459
Well, it seems like the two ofyou
have issues to work out.

428
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:33,460
I'm going to go outside.

429
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:36,827
Doyou know what he did to me
when I was a child?

430
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:39,560
No, but why don't we get Leo
and tell him?

431
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,125
He locked me in a room
with a boa constrictor...

432
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:44,797
and told me I couldn't get out
until I killed it.

433
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:52,707
The important thing is thatyou
got out and you're fine. You know?

434
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:55,944
He kept me in that room for six weeks!

435
00:28:56,017 --> 00:28:58,485
But look at the wonderful
complexion you have.

436
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:01,522
Don't be afraid.
I loved that snake.

437
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:03,523
You share too much.

438
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:07,585
Help.

439
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:18,669
So tell me,
what was your snake's name?

440
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,139
Cocteau.

441
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:22,039
Cocteau?

442
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,805
Like the French playwright?

443
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:27,040
After my two favorite body parts.

444
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:35,514
Red light, green light!

445
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:38,453
Red light, green light!

446
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,990
You're it.

447
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:46,791
Gustav!

448
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,032
Now we are locked in together,
like me and the snake.

449
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:53,904
Oh, great!
Just great.

450
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:55,943
Look, cute boy.

451
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,639
- You seem like a reasonable type.
- Don't flatter me!

452
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:03,707
You have a big nose, your feet stink
and your mother dresses you funny.

453
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,354
There is no scholarship.

454
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:10,482
You are only here
because my fatherwants to huntyou.

455
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,049
My God, you'll say anything,
won'tyou?

456
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:15,688
Now, how doyou sound
your fatherwants to hunt me?

457
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:20,359
Whywould he give me this fancy
hunting outfit ifhe wanted to hunt me?

458
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:23,029
- Explain yourself.
- I can protectyou.

459
00:30:24,172 --> 00:30:25,605
Don't go!

460
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:34,679
Oh, you play!

461
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,851
Listen, I just metyour crazy son.

462
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:38,512
Listen, I just metyour crazy son.

463
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,281
No offense.

464
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:46,191
He made up the wackest story aboutyou
wanting to hunt me. You believe that?

465
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:49,353
Ridiculous, isn't it?

466
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,628
Can you imagine the demons that kid's
working out? You hunting people?

467
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:58,464
My God. It would almost be funny
ifit wasn't so--

468
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,309
Ifit wasn't so--

469
00:31:28,102 --> 00:31:31,469
This is the most disgusting thing...

470
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:34,007
I have ever seen.

471
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:36,805
Those heads haven't been dusted
in months!

472
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:41,279
I'm going to get a wet rag
and I'll be right back. Bye.

473
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:49,186
I don't wanna die!
I'm tooyoung!

474
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,622
Get offme, you freak!

475
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:57,858
Want a piece ofme?
Get a piece ofme.

476
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:02,536
My springbok pelt!

477
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:05,471
I'm sorry. I couldn't make it
to the newspaper.

478
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:11,336
- I bagged this on my ninth birthday.
- He was a prodigy.

479
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:15,906
By the time I was 30, I had hunted
nearly every animal there was.

480
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:19,886
Yeah? You won't be so cocky
when I reportyou to the ASPCA!

481
00:32:19,954 --> 00:32:21,888
- I was bored.
- Bored, sir?

482
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:26,188
All right, so I was depressed!
I needed a challenge.

483
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:30,288
Haveyou tried Parcheesi?
It's a game ofskill and chance.

484
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,995
Here on this island, I've hunted every
ethnicity ofhuman except one.

485
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:38,470
My God! Haven't theJewish people
suffered enough?

486
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,131
You are Puerto Rican?

487
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,837
What, me? Oh, no.

488
00:32:50,418 --> 00:32:52,147
I am French!

489
00:33:03,464 --> 00:33:08,527
Look at me. I'm brooding,
yet craving rich sauces.

490
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:11,094
You are next, Mr. Vargas.

491
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,699
But I break out when I'm shellacked.

492
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:17,370
What's more embarrassing
than a zitty head on the wall?

493
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:18,844
Besides...

494
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:23,247
I'll make a nasty face,
and I'll destroyyour display.

495
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:30,086
Ifyou survive for 24 hours,
you getyour $50,000.

496
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,956
$50,000?

497
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:35,291
My God!
Why didn'tyou say so?

498
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:37,695
Hunt away, great white hunter!

499
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,562
Hunt--

500
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:41,295
Hunt away.

501
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:44,236
And ifyou don't, it's the shelf.

502
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:55,146
Father, I don't want
to participate in this. It's wrong.

503
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:57,275
You have to learn sometime.

504
00:33:57,352 --> 00:34:01,015
Whywould I ever have to learn
how to hunt people?

505
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:03,751
The hunt isjust a metaphor...

506
00:34:03,825 --> 00:34:08,819
for the glorious cycle
ofendless life and rebirth.

507
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:13,595
And remember, always, always
shoot him in the brain.

508
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:15,602
- I hateyou.
- Shut up.

509
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,230
I'm getting more tea.

510
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:23,266
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me, but--

511
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,911
Why do I look like
I'm from the ''Jungle Book''...

512
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,848
and you get the nice
Banana Republic stuff?

513
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:31,851
Does that seem fair toyou?

514
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,083
I thoughtyou'd like it.
It's the costume ofyour ancestors.

515
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,684
- Mywhat?
- I think it adds a theatrical element.

516
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:42,059
Stay out ofthis.

517
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:46,533
I want some boots, some khakis,
some turtlenecks and some--

518
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:50,602
You have guns.
That's not fair.

519
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:55,040
I'm not going to play till
I get something. I can't hearyou.

520
00:34:58,312 --> 00:34:59,973
- This is it?
- Yeah!

521
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:02,948
- This is it?
- All yours!

522
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:07,477
Oh, well, well. Why don't wejust get
a candlestick and play Clue?

523
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:09,614
I'll be Colonel Mustard.
You be Mrs. Peacock.

524
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:14,184
First we start with
a traditional toast.

525
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,030
Toyou, Mr. Vargas. Good luck.

526
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:19,896
Good luck toyou, too.

527
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:22,663
Actually, I take that back.
I hopeyou don't do well.

528
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:26,366
I hopeyou get violated
by pig-monkey men in the woods.

529
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:38,752
All right, I've got the upper hand.
What's to keep me from shooting you now?

530
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:45,221
Other than that.

531
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,328
What areyou doing?

532
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,763
Your 24 hours have begun. Go.

533
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:58,328
- I have one thing to add.
- What?

534
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,900
I lied on the form. I'm not
the perfect specimen I appear to be.

535
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:08,506
I have the public school gypsy curse.
Stuttering dyslexia.

536
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,778
I b-bead r-rackwards.

537
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:13,343
I g-get mords wixed up.

538
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,616
I'm narcoleptic.

539
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,187
And you are?
See? See?

540
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,196
I have Tourette's!

541
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,722
Yes, nice German. Freak! Weirdo!

542
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,529
Those things don't grow on trees!

543
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:38,106
I'm scared ofyou! I'll come back
when you're feeling better.

544
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:07,073
Think, Pest. Think, think, think!
Think, old buddy.

545
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:11,805
Your people came from the rain forest.
You must've inherited some skills.

546
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:22,782
Now I'm nice and limber.

547
00:38:01,562 --> 00:38:03,689
That's more like it.

548
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:07,165
My animalistical instincts
are finally kicking in.

549
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:17,508
Himmel, when we find him,
I wantyou to make the kill.

550
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,778
I don't want to make the kill.

551
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,908
I want to be a hairdresser,
write musicals.

552
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:28,153
- What?
- You'd love it ifit were true.

553
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:32,488
You'd tell your friends aboutyour
hairdresser son who listens to Merman.

554
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:37,894
Will you look at the size
ofthat snake?

555
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:43,532
You and your snake obsession!

556
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:48,803
Ifyou don't like it, maybeyou should
not have locked me in with a snake.

557
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:51,106
Areyou on that again?

558
00:38:51,178 --> 00:38:54,944
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to boreyou
with my life's defining trauma.

559
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,745
It's not dry enough.

560
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,384
I can never please him.

561
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,964
Something is wrong.

562
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:15,525
What could be wrong?
We're hunting a human being.

563
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,004
Other fathers take their sons
to baseball games, but--

564
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:21,007
Tell it to Ricky Lake.

565
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:25,444
I can see it now. '' Nazi Fathers
and Their Snake-Obsessed Sons.''

566
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:28,914
What is this?

567
00:39:41,662 --> 00:39:43,095
Get me down.

568
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:45,860
This Pest is good.

569
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:49,300
- Get me down!
- Don't be such a sissy!

570
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:53,033
I don't know ifyou've noticed lately,
but I am a sissy!

571
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,411
- Whatyou doin'?
- Putting you out ofyour misery.

572
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,413
Come on.

573
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,820
- Doyou hear that moaning?
- It's me.

574
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,085
No, the other moaning.

575
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,658
My stomach is funky.

576
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,029
Thank God for some privacy.

577
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:30,210
- My back hurts where the tree hit me.
- Quiet.

578
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:36,341
''Whether 'tis nobler in the mind...

579
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:39,818
to suffer the slings and arrows...

580
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:42,253
ofoutrageous fortune--''

581
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:45,953
Scat. Shoo.

582
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,654
I can't concentrate
when I'm being watched.

583
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,658
I farted. Doyou think
I smell like this all the time?

584
00:40:56,237 --> 00:40:58,501
What's that smell?

585
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:03,534
Look. There.

586
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,546
My horoscope.

587
00:41:06,614 --> 00:41:08,707
'' Beware ofstrangers offering...

588
00:41:08,783 --> 00:41:11,718
phony scholarships.''

589
00:41:11,786 --> 00:41:15,882
Guess I'll have to use my socks.
At least they're soft.

590
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:20,589
I wantyou to take him out.

591
00:41:20,661 --> 00:41:22,185
Why me?

592
00:41:22,263 --> 00:41:26,222
I wantyou to experience
the utter ecstasy that comes...

593
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,396
from feeling the hot, throbbing force
ofa man's life...

594
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:32,405
when it's in your hands.

595
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:33,940
- Poison darts?
- Perfect.

596
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:35,839
Just a second. Oops.

597
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,053
Himmel!

598
00:41:58,365 --> 00:42:00,230
What a mess!

599
00:42:00,301 --> 00:42:03,168
The explosion blew him
right out ofhis sneakers.

600
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,869
Looks likeyour hunt is over.

601
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,035
I'm going back to the house
before I miss Hogan's Heroes.

602
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,256
He's alive.

603
00:42:23,324 --> 00:42:27,124
ColonelHogan, wouldyoujoin us
fordinnertonight?

604
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:29,389
ColonelBakerisgoing to tell us
the truth...

605
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,626
about the Germanarmy's glorious
Campaign on the Russian front.

606
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,294
Whykillallyourappetites?

607
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:51,107
Pest, you're supposed to be dead!

608
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:53,176
I can't.

609
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:54,949
I won't.

610
00:42:55,022 --> 00:42:56,455
I shouldn't.

611
00:42:58,259 --> 00:43:00,227
All right, I will.

612
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:04,890
- You've got to be quiet.
- You! You!

613
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:08,423
You tried to hunt me.

614
00:43:10,204 --> 00:43:11,637
Get back!

615
00:43:11,705 --> 00:43:14,196
What areyou trying to do,
perfume me to death?

616
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:16,573
These are sex secretion pheromones.

617
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:19,272
Father uses them
to lure horny animals into traps.

618
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,712
Here. Watch the tape.

619
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:27,920
This is disgusting.

620
00:43:29,556 --> 00:43:33,788
I'm gonna take some ofthese
for my girlfriend.

621
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,659
She hates when I go away
and don't bring her nothing.

622
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,164
They onlywork on males.
Can I fixyou one?

623
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:41,292
No, you've done enough for one day.

624
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,996
You're mad we tried
to cutyour head off?

625
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:48,508
I'm not mad.
Do I look mad toyou?

626
00:43:50,744 --> 00:43:55,204
I knowyou're not into
all this Wild Kingdom stuff.

627
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:58,342
So why don'tyou and I
escape back to Miami...

628
00:43:58,419 --> 00:44:02,116
get away from your crazy, ugly,
psychotic father, no offense...

629
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:06,888
and you and I will play snakey-wakey
wheneveryou want to.

630
00:44:06,961 --> 00:44:08,394
Really?

631
00:44:08,462 --> 00:44:09,986
C-Certainly.

632
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:16,625
- We'll takeyour father's speedboat.
- I get seasick.

633
00:44:16,704 --> 00:44:18,228
You'll be fine.

634
00:44:33,821 --> 00:44:36,722
I told you, I get seasick.

635
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,815
Well, no duh!

636
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,590
- What are those seagulls doing?
- They've come to eatyourvomit.

637
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:47,463
Will you stop that?

638
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:51,300
Fine. But I'd watch out
for the seagullses ifI was you.

639
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,296
Why?

640
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,372
- I'll be leaving now.
- It stings.

641
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,139
I'm blind!

642
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:01,181
Pest, where'd you go?

643
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,878
My father's gonna kill me!

644
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,426
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

645
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:18,397
You know the reputation about
Latino men, right?

646
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:22,367
They didn't have any Latino man
on the show because everybody knows...

647
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:26,839
that he would be having his way
with Ginger, MaryAnn, Mrs. Howell...

648
00:45:26,907 --> 00:45:28,875
and the Professor.

649
00:45:28,942 --> 00:45:32,878
Then let me askyou a question. Ifyou
had to choose, who would you pick?

650
00:45:32,946 --> 00:45:34,675
MaryAnn or Ginger?

651
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:37,574
Ginger. No contest.

652
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:43,918
- Is thatyou, man?
- Areyou all right?

653
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,982
What happened?

654
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,085
I can't go on.

655
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:52,496
Must have dry land.
Oh, dry land!

656
00:45:52,566 --> 00:45:54,693
- You okay?
- What happened?

657
00:45:54,768 --> 00:45:57,202
What happened? Oh, God!

658
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:59,205
The room is spinning!

659
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:05,135
What happened? What happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

660
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:10,883
Contract.
''I want to huntyou.''

661
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:15,217
And his son.
'' Pet my snake.''

662
00:46:16,657 --> 00:46:19,990
'' Playmate, come out and play.''
Seagulls!

663
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:24,656
He made doody-doody. It was horrible.
Don't let them take me back.

664
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,191
What areyou saying?

665
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:32,364
Listen. Take a swim in the pool.
It'll helpyou relax.

666
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:33,872
- Trust me.
- A swim?

667
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:38,503
- A splash.
- Obviously, you haven't been listening!

668
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:43,949
I've been swimming for five hours!
What don'tyou understand?

669
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:49,720
Maybe one lap?

670
00:46:52,993 --> 00:46:57,225
Then there were 20 ofthem.
Did I say 20? I meant an army.

671
00:46:57,297 --> 00:46:59,663
Don't be fakingjacks.

672
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:04,033
- There's no scammification going on.
- You're not being hunted.

673
00:47:04,104 --> 00:47:06,664
- I am too being hunted.
- Are not.

674
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,674
- Am too.
- Am not.

675
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:19,713
See? See? I told you.
I am being hunted.

676
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:22,550
Give up, Pest!
There's nowhere to hide.

677
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:27,356
Thank the Lord,
he's here to kill me!

678
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:32,260
Snap. Run!

679
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:39,737
That guy's psycho.
Why is he afteryou?

680
00:47:39,806 --> 00:47:43,139
I don't know.
Must be my animal magnetism.

681
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,043
Get in. Let's go!
Let's get the hell out ofhere.

682
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,776
I told you I was being hunted.
Did you believe me? No.

683
00:47:52,853 --> 00:47:56,653
- Because no one ever believes me.
- We believeyou. Who's got the plan?

684
00:47:56,723 --> 00:48:00,284
- Okay, I got the master plan.
- Kick it.

685
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,887
- Remember my cousin Roger?
- The mad fool?

686
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,957
The mad cool guy. We could go to
his place and lay low till morning.

687
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:11,334
- Perfect. I can't.
- What?

688
00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:15,136
We gotta make one, stupid,
meaningless stop.

689
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:16,642
Where, Pest?

690
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:19,338
No place special.
Xantha's.

691
00:48:20,747 --> 00:48:23,773
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm in love.

692
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,444
I'm sure her parents will understand...

693
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,683
ifyou explain tonight's not good
as you're being hunted.

694
00:48:29,756 --> 00:48:34,125
- They're black. They'll understand.
- Yeah?

695
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:37,353
What's up, freak?

696
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:40,958
It's me.

697
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,737
You better recognize, baby.
You act like--

698
00:48:45,806 --> 00:48:51,472
Yo, Mrs. Kent. I'm not sweating you,
butyou're one fine heifer.

699
00:48:51,545 --> 00:48:54,776
What's up, Mack Daddy?

700
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,749
Kill whitey. Free Angela Davis.
Say it loud. '' Be black and be proud.''

701
00:48:57,818 --> 00:49:01,754
- Yes, Lord!
- Why don't we go in here?

702
00:49:01,822 --> 00:49:05,053
That boy's on drugs.
Who's Angela Davis?

703
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:09,186
All the cars you could get,
why did you pick this one?

704
00:49:09,263 --> 00:49:11,697
I thoughtyou'd like it.
It's German.

705
00:49:11,765 --> 00:49:14,461
Did you ever hear of BMW, idiot?

706
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,230
I'm sorry I can never pleaseyou!

707
00:49:17,304 --> 00:49:21,866
Shh. I'm getting something.
Here, have a look.

708
00:49:21,942 --> 00:49:26,242
The tracking device I placed in
his underwear seems to be working.

709
00:49:26,313 --> 00:49:29,544
Why does Leo get
all the goodjobs?

710
00:49:29,616 --> 00:49:32,676
We have a fix on him, sir.
Go west!

711
00:49:35,322 --> 00:49:38,155
What's with
the African getup?

712
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,819
All this is foryou,
Xantha-poo.

713
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,761
I'm trying to impressify
your parents.

714
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:48,563
Does it scareyou that I arouse
the passions ofthe Dark Continent?

715
00:49:53,774 --> 00:49:56,538
It scares me that
you're wearing a dress to dinner.

716
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:59,374
This is nothing compared
to my morning ensemble.

717
00:49:59,446 --> 00:50:02,574
How about a little kiss?
Come on, suck face.

718
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:07,008
Well, I've prepared
an authentic Cuban meal.

719
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,749
Platanos e frijos losnegros.

720
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,791
Why Cuban?

721
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:19,594
Do I look Cuban toyou? Do these
look like Cuban features toyou?

722
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:22,794
What does a brother have to do to
get some respect around here, bitch?

723
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:29,231
I'm this close to rioting. This close.
IfI wasn't so hungry, I'd leave.

724
00:50:30,043 --> 00:50:32,204
Will you pass me
the platanos, please?

725
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,040
Something's gone wrong
with the location tracker.

726
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,550
It seems to be overheating.

727
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:43,720
Honey, areyou all right?
You're dripping wet.

728
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,089
It's from being next toyou.
I'm burning up with passion.

729
00:50:48,161 --> 00:50:50,061
Know what I'm saying?

730
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,793
- Don't act likeyou haven't been there.
- Not lately.

731
00:50:55,402 --> 00:50:57,893
I think it's burning out.

732
00:50:59,773 --> 00:51:02,640
That bastard's gonads are sweating.

733
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:05,507
Boost the power!

734
00:51:10,717 --> 00:51:12,150
I'm burnin' up!

735
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,286
I told the guy at Africans 'R' Us
that I wanted summerweight robes.

736
00:51:17,357 --> 00:51:19,188
Drugs.

737
00:51:19,259 --> 00:51:22,695
It burns! Oh, my God, it burns!
It's burning!

738
00:51:28,869 --> 00:51:30,131
It burns!

739
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,038
That boy's got syphilis!

740
00:51:37,077 --> 00:51:39,944
Don't be cruel!
Get 'em offme!

741
00:51:57,264 --> 00:52:01,223
Ifyou was abducted
by a space alien chick...

742
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:06,000
would you orwould you not
haveyourwaywith her?

743
00:52:08,742 --> 00:52:12,178
Before it cut off,
the signal came from this house.

744
00:52:12,245 --> 00:52:15,737
I'm going in there.
You two stay here.

745
00:52:15,816 --> 00:52:19,616
Here, Mr. Shank,
I have prepared a dosage...

746
00:52:19,686 --> 00:52:22,712
which will immediately
render him unconscious.

747
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:25,485
Then we can take him with us...

748
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,221
und at our leisure,
cut offhis head.

749
00:52:28,295 --> 00:52:31,355
Leo, you're a saint.

750
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:33,126
Be careful, sir.

751
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:37,930
These Volkswagens are smaller
than they used to be.

752
00:52:38,004 --> 00:52:39,699
Check it out.

753
00:52:39,773 --> 00:52:44,437
She's got the body parts
ofa hot Earth woman.

754
00:52:52,986 --> 00:52:55,955
Fear not, the Pest line
shall continue.

755
00:52:56,022 --> 00:52:59,014
My childrens
have been saved.

756
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,957
Yeah!

757
00:53:01,027 --> 00:53:05,964
That'll teach me not to spring for
extra-strength fungus spray. You know?

758
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:10,894
Look, man.
Look over there.

759
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,604
That's Colonel Klink!

760
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:18,269
He's climbing through
Xantha's window, man!

761
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:20,279
Wait here. I'll be right back.

762
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:22,042
Karate time.

763
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:24,673
Mrs. Kent, my sister.

764
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:27,515
Let me explain the origins
ofmy blackness one more time.

765
00:53:27,587 --> 00:53:31,921
My Spanish ancestors came and
had sex with my Indian ancestors.

766
00:53:31,992 --> 00:53:34,790
And then they had sex
with my black ancestors.

767
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:37,591
Who then had more sex
with the Indians.

768
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:41,464
And there's rumor that somebody
slept with aJew. Fancy that!

769
00:53:47,574 --> 00:53:51,169
Mrs. Kent, it's kosher. It's all right.
He was an EthiopianJew.

770
00:53:54,247 --> 00:53:57,739
I can't find my pills anywhere!

771
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:01,082
You know how white people's food
gives me gas!

772
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,088
What happened?

773
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,920
What did you do to my family?

774
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,825
I don't know. I mentioned I might
be prone to celebrate Rosh Hashanah...

775
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,830
and, bam, prejudice rears
his ugly head again!

776
00:54:16,236 --> 00:54:19,330
Oh, I see, you're gonna try
and kill me. Try it, because--

777
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,042
Could I do that again? I was looking
through the wrong thingy.

778
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:31,948
You're a pretty lousy shot
for a criminal.

779
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:32,985
Hello.

780
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,064
Any more surprises?

781
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:49,101
Don't!

782
00:54:49,169 --> 00:54:51,262
I really hateyou.

783
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:57,576
Let'sjust get
this little game over, shall we?

784
00:55:02,315 --> 00:55:04,306
You missed me!

785
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:07,979
YouCan'thitme
You'reabigsuCker-butt

786
00:55:09,756 --> 00:55:11,747
ICan'tbelieveyou're German

787
00:55:27,641 --> 00:55:31,509
Where wereyou? Where the hell
wereyou when I needed you?

788
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,546
I am so glad you're here.
Check it.

789
00:55:33,613 --> 00:55:37,447
Would you orwould you not
have sex with a space alien chick?

790
00:55:37,517 --> 00:55:38,449
What?

791
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:46,024
We have no way
oftracking him anymore.

792
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:48,720
Just shut up!
Give me the phone.

793
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:52,263
Hello?

794
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:56,632
Oh, yo!
What's up, yo? Listen up.

795
00:55:56,703 --> 00:56:00,764
I got the 4-1 -1 on Pest Vargas,
mamasita.

796
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:06,005
- Who is this?
- This is the bum and all that.

797
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,774
Listen.

798
00:56:07,847 --> 00:56:11,943
The word up is that Pest Vargas
has goosed your nugget...

799
00:56:12,018 --> 00:56:15,385
andisgonnaskip the foot
in themorning, homey.

800
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,423
Why areyou telling me this?
What's he done toyou?

801
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:22,894
Well, he called my mother
a big, fat Scottish slut.

802
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,953
We'll take care ofit.

803
00:56:26,499 --> 00:56:30,401
Fellas, put all the men out
on the street looking for the Pest.

804
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,768
He's out there somewhere
and I wanna find him.

805
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:35,205
They're putting the word out.

806
00:56:36,776 --> 00:56:40,735
I'll be able to monitor
all their incoming calls.

807
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:44,079
So, we'll know where he is
as soon as they do.

808
00:56:55,261 --> 00:56:58,458
We gotta find a place to hide.
I'm serious!

809
00:56:58,531 --> 00:57:01,022
Where's the last place
Gustav would think oflooking?

810
00:57:01,101 --> 00:57:04,537
- Think! Useyour head!
- All right! Calm down!

811
00:57:06,106 --> 00:57:08,540
Yo, Pest.
Check it out.

812
00:57:11,444 --> 00:57:14,174
Oh, no. Oh, no!

813
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:17,779
Hello,Jews!

814
00:57:19,953 --> 00:57:21,887
Nobody's gonna see us here.
What areyou--

815
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:33,028
Shalom! And mazol tov,
my little gefiltes and yentas.

816
00:57:33,099 --> 00:57:35,465
And you are?

817
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,197
I am a meshuggener,
but ofcourse.

818
00:57:38,271 --> 00:57:43,299
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Rabbi Vargassteenstine.

819
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,970
And this is
my farChadat associate...

820
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:50,573
Rabbi Chubby Bergbaumsteenstein.

821
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:55,019
Yes, I know! He's an EthiopianJew
from Ethiopia, ofcourse.

822
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:56,749
Really?
Where in Ethiopia?

823
00:57:56,823 --> 00:57:59,314
Yo, man, I'm from South Bay, bro--

824
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,917
Unfortunately, the Lord saw fit
to take away his voice box.

825
00:58:01,995 --> 00:58:04,623
But he has a canasta game
to die for.

826
00:58:04,697 --> 00:58:08,497
We'd like to stay, but I got a pain
in my tchotchke. I gotta go.

827
00:58:09,936 --> 00:58:13,838
Angus, I think
I've found our man.

828
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:19,307
Sir, look. It seems our Latino
has found religion.

829
00:58:19,379 --> 00:58:21,870
He appears to be leaving
a synagogue.

830
00:58:26,352 --> 00:58:29,810
So, funny looking,
got any more genius ideas?

831
00:58:29,889 --> 00:58:32,050
Yo, man.
I'll pick another place.

832
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:34,616
No, thanks.
I'm pickin' the place.

833
00:58:34,694 --> 00:58:37,959
Right here at the Paris Club.
There's a private party going on.

834
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:39,965
I'll pull into the parking lot.

835
00:58:45,572 --> 00:58:48,200
Hey, yo!
It's all lovely.

836
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:51,300
I hear there's
a mad-sick party going on.

837
00:58:51,377 --> 00:58:53,368
Can you hook up a brother
and his brother?

838
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:58,110
Mad?
Dude, parties are never mad.

839
00:58:58,184 --> 00:58:59,913
They're angry! Duh!

840
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,620
The thing is...

841
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:05,624
this is a private party, Cheech!

842
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,059
I can't believe this.

Seriously, I betyou could

00:59:12,332 --> 00:59:15,790
- You guys are harsh!
- Yeah, you guys are harsh!

845
00:59:15,869 --> 00:59:17,803
Actually, you guys suck.

846

A tranquilizer dart is in her butt.

Split up.

01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,313

883
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:01,323

My God, you suck!

893

I'm notjust saying it lightly.
You really suck!

894
01:04:01,454 --> 01:04:03,718
I wanna put a hot poker
through my ears!

895
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:06,849
What'd you do with your singing les--
Get offme. You don't know me.

896
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,894
- Let me showyou to a chair.
- Don't show me nothing.

897
01:04:08,961 --> 01:04:11,486
Show me the way outta here.

01:04:11,564 --> 01:04:14,192
- Goodness gracious!
- Good show,ja?

Ja, is a good show.

900
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:19,638
Could you go away, little man?
You bother me.

901
01:04:19,705 --> 01:04:22,640
- He wants a tip.
- A tip? Why didn'tyou say so?

902
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:25,768
You buy Honda stock. Okay, get away.
Your breath smells.

903
01:04:25,845 --> 01:04:28,837
He's so too sucky.
I can't--

904
01:04:32,685 --> 01:04:34,118
Ninja! Ninja!

905
01:04:37,823 --> 01:04:41,623
- Ninja. I am a Ninja warrior.
- Really!

906
01:04:41,694 --> 01:04:43,662
Who would like to be next?

907
01:04:43,729 --> 01:04:45,094
Don't be shy.

908
01:04:45,164 --> 01:04:46,927
All right, sir.

909
01:04:46,999 --> 01:04:49,900
- Come on up.
- You go.

910
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:54,005
Don't be bashful.
Come up.

911
01:04:54,073 --> 01:04:57,668
You make mistake.
I go. No, I can't.

912
01:04:57,743 --> 01:05:02,112
- Come on up.
- I can, I can.

913
01:05:02,181 --> 01:05:04,274
All right!

914
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:06,910
I was hoping to see my family.
Shoguns and all that.

915
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:10,622
It's a dangerous crowd out there.

916
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:13,454
Which Karaoke selection
areyou going to do?

917
01:05:13,526 --> 01:05:16,461
- What selections do we have today?
- They're on the monitor.

918
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:22,659
''TV Favorites.'' Why not? Okay.

919
01:05:22,735 --> 01:05:26,865
All right, TV Favorites.
Take it away.

920
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:29,674

Thankyou very much.

931
01:06:03,242 --> 01:06:07,702
That is Pest Vargas,
you idiot!

932
01:06:09,482 --> 01:06:13,646
I'm going to sing another song,
something from my childhood.

933
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:19,888
You annoying little weasel,
Pest Vargas!

934
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:23,417
You a big irritate, round eye.
I am not Pest.

935
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:28,030
I am Uni Wasabi.

936
01:06:29,835 --> 01:06:34,568
I had the pleasure ofhunting Uni
Wasabi, and you are no Uni Wasabi.

937
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,073
I am too!

938
01:06:38,844 --> 01:06:42,041
Perhaps this
will helpyou decide.

939
01:06:42,114 --> 01:06:44,776
Perhaps this...

940
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:47,580
will helpyou decide.

941
01:06:50,189 --> 01:06:53,784
You defend yourself
with a punyvile ofcat piss?

942
01:06:53,859 --> 01:06:57,295
- Leo, go get him.
- It's the sex pheromones.

943
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,024
Gustav...

944
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,763
I find myself
strangely drawn toyou.

945
01:07:04,837 --> 01:07:07,431
- Father, I feel funny.
- What?

946
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:15,273
Let me at him.

947
01:07:15,348 --> 01:07:18,181
You horny dog.
I should've had you fixed.

948
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,774
Let me go.

949
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:23,344
I didn't knowyou could sing.

950
01:07:23,422 --> 01:07:25,686
Stickwith me, son, and I'll learn ya.

951
01:07:25,758 --> 01:07:28,989
- Where's Gustav?
- He's meeting some new people.

952
01:07:29,061 --> 01:07:31,996
- Let's go.
- I thinkyou should come with us.

953
01:07:32,064 --> 01:07:35,625
No, thanks. My mother said
never to go with strangers.

954
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:38,761
Butyou seem nice.

955
01:07:43,876 --> 01:07:47,744
Pest, Pest, Pest,
you're a great disappointment.

956
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:51,749
You thought I was gonna be taller?
I get that a lot, don't I?

957
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:54,615
Why don'tyou do that impression
I like so much?

958
01:07:54,687 --> 01:07:58,817
I don't want to. The Italians
never make me do impressions.

959
01:07:58,891 --> 01:08:01,985
- Do it.
- Captain, I cannot do it.

960
01:08:02,061 --> 01:08:05,258
The dilithium crystals are breaking up.
She's gonna blow.

961
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,369
Not so fast.

962
01:08:18,744 --> 01:08:20,302
Where's my money?

963
01:08:20,379 --> 01:08:23,314
Look, I'll have the money--
What's the day after today?

964
01:08:23,382 --> 01:08:25,441
- Tomorrow.
- Myword is my bond.

965
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,452
I don't trustyourword.

966
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,251
Okay. Then...

967
01:08:31,323 --> 01:08:35,885
take as collateral that which is
the most precious to me in the world.

968
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:39,158
And what would that be,
Mr. Vargas?

969
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,469
It's my best friend...

970
01:08:46,906 --> 01:08:48,669
Ninja.

971
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:52,643
Pest, don't leave me!
They've got skirts!

972
01:08:53,813 --> 01:08:56,043
Don't worry, little friend.

973
01:08:57,616 --> 01:09:00,107
I can't believe
youjust did that.

974
01:09:00,186 --> 01:09:03,519
Don't worry. I got it all covered.
The 24 hours is almost up.

975
01:09:03,589 --> 01:09:06,524
Then we'll get Gustav's money,
then we'll pick him up like that.

976
01:09:06,592 --> 01:09:10,289
- I'm not talking about that!
- What areyou talking about?

977
01:09:10,362 --> 01:09:14,924
You said he was your best friend.
I thought I was your best friend.

978
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:19,200
Chubby-woomsy.

979
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:23,002
You are my best friend.
That's why I picked Ninja.

980
01:09:31,217 --> 01:09:32,650
Hello.

981
01:09:32,718 --> 01:09:35,585
- Hello, Pest.
- The oneandonly.

982
01:09:35,654 --> 01:09:39,420
And you are? Wait, don't tell me.
You'll spoil the moment.

983
01:09:39,492 --> 01:09:40,925
Gustav.

984
01:09:40,993 --> 01:09:43,962
Pest, you have
a marvelous family.

985
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:47,760
My familywas never part
ofthe contract.

986
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:51,394
Neitherwas your girlfriend's family
or her best friend.

987
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:55,201
But I don't care.
I'm gonna kill 'em all!

988
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:59,643
He's gonna kill my family. You do that
and you're gonna be in big trouble.

989
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:02,875
Jail even.
Can you say ''prison bitch''?

990
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,150
Tomorrow I return
to my homeland...

991
01:10:07,219 --> 01:10:09,983
where Iregain mystatus
asa Citizen ofGermany.

992
01:10:10,055 --> 01:10:12,649
But first I have
to settle up with you.

993
01:10:12,725 --> 01:10:17,628
No, Gustav. You're always thinking of
others. We're even. Go back to Germany.

994
01:10:17,696 --> 01:10:20,824
Don't even worry about saying good-bye.
Send me a postcard. Fax ifyou can.

995
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:25,394
You better get to the freighter
at pier 1 6 in 20 minutes...

996
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:29,271
oryou're gonna be
one lonely little Latino.

997
01:10:29,341 --> 01:10:33,937
I'll be there. But for any reason
I'm late, could you start with Malaria?

998
01:10:36,715 --> 01:10:41,618
Head to LibertyShip on pier 1 6.
Step on it, double it, man!

999
01:10:46,458 --> 01:10:49,518
Don't be sojumpy.

1000
01:10:49,595 --> 01:10:52,792
- He's got a gun!
- Leave me alone!

1001
01:10:52,865 --> 01:10:57,996
Why areyou doing this?
Why areyou hunting my Pest?

1002
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:03,872
The man you know as Pest is actually
an operative in your secret service.

1003
01:11:03,943 --> 01:11:08,107
The underworld has placed a high price
on his head. I intend to collect.

1004
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:12,945
See, Felix? I told you
that my Pest wasn'tjust a bum!

1005
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:15,248
Actually, I lied.
I'm just hunting him...

1006
01:11:15,321 --> 01:11:20,657
because no one will miss
an inconsequential flotsam like him.

1007
01:11:20,726 --> 01:11:24,093
- That makes more sense.
- How could you agree with this monster?

1008
01:11:24,163 --> 01:11:27,291
- Be quiet.
- Sit down. He gets angry.

1009
01:11:37,576 --> 01:11:40,807
You stay here and guard them.

1010
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:43,177
I'm going to go look around.

1011
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:56,161
Oh,Jack! Oh, SlapJones, we finally
got the good stuff, kid.

1012
01:11:57,396 --> 01:12:00,422
- Be all you can be!
- Don't ask, don't tell, right?

1013
01:12:00,499 --> 01:12:02,433
What's that mean?

1014
01:12:02,501 --> 01:12:04,833
- Nothing.
-Just checking.

1015
01:12:09,274 --> 01:12:11,435
You have to believe me.

1016
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:13,444
None ofthis was my idea.

1017
01:12:16,515 --> 01:12:19,643
I feel you understand.
I get seasick!

1018
01:12:19,718 --> 01:12:22,084
Whywould I want to be on a boat?

1019
01:12:22,154 --> 01:12:24,918
Snake boy's got everybody
I care about down there.

1020
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:27,049
We gotta think
ofsomething fast.

1021
01:12:27,126 --> 01:12:32,120
I'm gonna give Gustav a little attitude
adjustment, soyou're gonna have--

1022
01:12:32,197 --> 01:12:34,427
I'm not a bad person.

1023
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,698
To tell you the truth,
I don't think he's my father.

1024
01:12:39,738 --> 01:12:42,434
Gustav, where areyou?

1025
01:12:42,508 --> 01:12:44,499
I have arrived!

1026
01:12:46,845 --> 01:12:50,406
Welcome to the Love Boat.
I'm yourwaiter Isaac.

1027
01:12:50,482 --> 01:12:54,578
Gustav, where areyou?

1028
01:12:54,653 --> 01:12:56,712
Don't be shy.

1029
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:59,519
Goosey, I can seeyour bald spot.

1030
01:12:59,591 --> 01:13:02,185
You're getting warmer.
Oh, you're getting hot.

1031
01:13:02,261 --> 01:13:05,196
You're getting really hot.
You're boiling! You're on fire!

1032
01:13:06,532 --> 01:13:09,433
Goosey, look, I'm over here.

1033
01:13:09,501 --> 01:13:11,435
I'm ashadowofmy formerself.

1034
01:13:16,341 --> 01:13:17,774
SuCker!

1035
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:25,515
I'm thebig Cornholio.
Ineed T.D. formybungholio.

1036
01:13:25,584 --> 01:13:28,610
Oh, woeisme. Someone's
turnedmeintoa walkie-talkie.

1037
01:13:28,687 --> 01:13:32,282
Helpme!Helpme!

1038
01:13:32,357 --> 01:13:34,882
Why don'tyou come out, Pest?

1039
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,624
What haveyou got left after smoking
a huge cigar? A big butt!

1040
01:14:05,157 --> 01:14:07,091
Where areyou, Pest?

1041
01:14:08,727 --> 01:14:12,424
Yougotme, Gustav!
Yougotmelaughin'atyou.

1042
01:14:12,498 --> 01:14:14,830
My father is insane.

1043
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,095
Doyou know what
he did to me as a child?

1044
01:14:20,472 --> 01:14:22,963
All right, funny boy.

1045
01:14:24,676 --> 01:14:28,612
Ifyou don't come out,
your girlfriend gets it.

1046
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:32,241
All right, saggy cheeks.
But ifI come out, you gotta let her go.

1047
01:14:32,317 --> 01:14:33,579
Deal!

1048
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,249
Let her go.

1049
01:14:47,366 --> 01:14:50,233
- You're all right!
- Everything's okay.

1050
01:14:50,302 --> 01:14:52,031
Now come closer.

1051
01:14:52,104 --> 01:14:55,005
Any closer and
I'd be intimate with you.

1052
01:14:56,675 --> 01:14:59,644
- Only one pest can't be exterminated.
- But I thought--

1053
01:15:02,181 --> 01:15:04,911
Now dropyourweapons.

1054
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:10,882
I don't know how long
I can keep this thing from firing.

1055
01:15:14,126 --> 01:15:16,219
I loved it.

1056
01:15:16,295 --> 01:15:19,594
I guess wejust sit here and wait
till I become a rich man.

1057
01:15:21,733 --> 01:15:23,894
I meant to do that.

1058
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:30,597
Let me askyou a question.

1059
01:15:30,676 --> 01:15:32,473
How doyou feel?

1060
01:15:33,846 --> 01:15:37,873
Fine. Why, do I look bloated?
Am I bloated?

1061
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:40,714
Doyou remember our little toast
on the island, Pest?

1062
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,653
How could I forget?
It gave me indigestion.

1063
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,584
I poisoned your drink.

1064
01:15:46,658 --> 01:15:48,592
What?

1065
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:53,097
And the poison kills
in exactly 1 8 hours.

1066
01:15:53,165 --> 01:15:54,996
You are so diabolical.

1067
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:57,763
Ja.
You've got 1 5 seconds.

1068
01:15:57,836 --> 01:15:59,497
Enjoy it.

1069
01:16:03,675 --> 01:16:08,669
And by the way, the safe deposit box
is in the Miami Central Bank.

1070
01:16:08,747 --> 01:16:11,511
Your $50,000 is in there.

1071
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:14,017
Not that it would doyou
any good.

1072
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:20,481
What areyou talking about?
Hold this.

1073
01:16:20,559 --> 01:16:22,959
I never felt better
in my life!

1074
01:16:23,028 --> 01:16:25,019
IfI was poisoned,
could I do this?

1075
01:16:27,532 --> 01:16:31,161
Or this? Or this?

1076
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:52,585
I got the head bag.

1077
01:16:52,658 --> 01:16:54,785
Forget it.
That face wouldjust annoy me.

1078
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,327
You cheated!

1079
01:16:56,395 --> 01:17:01,059
- Not now. We'll discuss this at home.
- You'd have to shoot me first.

1080
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:06,504
- Can't believeyou shot him!
- He's wearing a bulletproofvest.

1081
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,708
It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

1082
01:17:10,776 --> 01:17:14,007
All right, fine! Himmel,
you stay here amongst the losers.

1083
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:15,512
Come on, Leo.

1084
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,816
Where to?

1085
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:22,251
We have much to do.
We're on ourway to the homeland.

1086
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:32,358
Good morning. I need
to get into my safe deposit box.

1087
01:17:32,431 --> 01:17:34,991
Ofcourse, Mr. Shank.
The guard will letyou in.

1088
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,729
Ja. Splendid.

1089
01:17:44,443 --> 01:17:46,911
I'll just be a minute, Andy.

1090
01:18:19,244 --> 01:18:20,871
Hello?

1091
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,743
Surprise!

1092
01:18:22,814 --> 01:18:25,305
- Pest!
- Yup.

1093
01:18:25,384 --> 01:18:28,353
- But, the poison should've--
- Killedme?

1094
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:33,323
Notlikely, sinCe Ipukedupall

1095
01:18:33,392 --> 01:18:39,092
With thehelp ofmy friend, the German
Ambassador, Iliberatedyourmoney.

1096
01:18:39,164 --> 01:18:43,658
-My money?
-Right. Andthere wasmore than $50,000.

1099
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:53,402
Hello, fellas. Good-bye.
Don'tforget to write.

1100
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:55,070
I'll getyou!

1101
01:18:57,416 --> 01:19:00,442
No! No!
I do not recognizeyour authority.

1102
01:19:00,519 --> 01:19:03,215
Go, Pest
Freak to the east

1103
01:19:05,057 --> 01:19:06,490
Yes!

1104
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:10,027
There he is!
I'm gonna kill you!

1105
01:19:10,095 --> 01:19:12,655
- How dareyou!
- I'm sorry, Mr. Ambassador.

1106
01:19:12,731 --> 01:19:14,665
He's not the Ambassador.
He's an impostor!

1107
01:19:14,733 --> 01:19:19,670
How dareyou question my authority!

1108
01:19:19,738 --> 01:19:23,504
IfI wasn't the Ambassador...

1109
01:19:23,575 --> 01:19:26,840
would I have the confidence
to do this?

1110
01:19:28,046 --> 01:19:29,809
Und this?

1111
01:19:34,386 --> 01:19:37,378
Would I have the downright
perverse impudence...

1112
01:19:37,456 --> 01:19:39,356
and lack oflove for my fellow man
to do this?

1113
01:19:39,424 --> 01:19:41,654
- Wedgie!
- God!

1114
01:19:41,726 --> 01:19:44,217
Therefore I must be
the Ambassador.

1115
01:19:44,296 --> 01:19:46,355
He is not even German.

1116
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,126
Our feet are the same.

1117
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,465
Good-bye toyou and you and you!

1118
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:53,470
Let's take him away!

1119

1122
01:20:12,324 --> 01:20:14,349
