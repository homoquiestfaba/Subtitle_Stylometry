1
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,601
(waves lapping)

2
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,501
(seagulls cawing)

3
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:26,635
Man:
One two three four!

4
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:29,501
(big band music playing)

5
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:17,703
- How about the paralegal?
- Which paralegal?

6
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,238
- The one at the beach?
- Herb's son-in-law? No, he's an idiot.

7
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,203
Okay, look.
I'm not ready yet.

8
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:25,803
How could you not be ready?
You'll be divorced in a month.

9
00:02:25,804 --> 00:02:28,003
Woman:
All right, shush.

10
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:31,003
Danny, I hear
you're selling trees now.

11
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:32,338
- Danny: Yeah.
- For the prom.

12
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:34,406
He's in charge of the whole thing.

13
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:36,540
- Oh, yeah?
- Who are you taking?

14
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,639
- What?
- You got a cute girlfriend?

15
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,904
- Uh...
- A friend.

16
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:41,839
- Yeah, just...
- A friend you're dating?

17
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,504
No. Well, she's...

18
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:45,304
- been my friend for a long time.
- Not dating?

19
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:48,304
- Not a date?
- leave him alone. He's working on it.

20
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:52,004
'Cause that's a big night.
I lost my virginity that night.

21
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,804
Yeah, well,
I've got a couple of options.

22
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:58,205
(big band music plays)

23
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:03,039
- Sakalov?
- Too tall for you,

24
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,704
like Big Bird tall.

25
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:06,704
Saperstein?

26
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:09,139
- With the long chin?
- What about Richter?

27
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,539
- I'd go with Richter.
- Nah, she's taken.

28
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,904
- Who?
- Bart.

29
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:14,490
- Yeah, right.
- Seriously.

30
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:16,005
Yeah, she's going with him.

31
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:17,740
- Like... wait.
- Yeah, she agreed to it.

32
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,405
- With Bart?
- Yup.

33
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:22,405
- Bart Beeber?
- It's probably just a sympathy thing.

34
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:24,905
- Yeah, but I mean... that's like...
- Dude, just forget it.

35
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:27,005
What about that sophomore
you drive to school?

36
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,105
Alice? Yeah yeah,
I'm thinking of her.

37
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:32,305
She's a cheerleader,
so she's limber.

38
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:34,990
- She's cute, yeah.
- It's a way to save face.

39
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:37,640
I mean, we talk
every day in the car, so...

40
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:39,507
You know what
it comes down to...

41
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:41,405
the photo at the end
of the night.

42
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:43,640
- That's your proof.
- And what do I do about Camille?

43
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,305
What if she asks?

44
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:48,340
Yeah, 'cause, I mean,
we've been friends for... I don't know...

45
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:51,140
- eight, maybe nine years.
- Dude, what other evening

46
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:53,006
in your whole life is as big?

47
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:55,506
- (glass shatters)
- Maybe your wedding night,

48
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:58,541
but who cares about that? Odds are
you're getting divorced, anyway.

49
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,806
- So what are you saying?
- Are you here

50
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:05,141
burning up
in this humid lizardy bullshit to die?

51
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:09,807
Or are you here to live?

52
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:16,441
(girls clapping)
#Be aggressive, B-E aggressive #

53
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:19,806
# B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E
aggressive. #

54
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:22,007
(guys yelling)

55
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:29,406
- Hey.
- Boy: Whoo!

56
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:32,242
Umm, are you sure
you don't want to come in?

57
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:35,042
'Cause, you know,
I could probably get you in.

58
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:37,107
No, it's fine.
I'll just hang out.

59
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:39,107
Okay, well, you know,
I'll just be...

60
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:41,407
I'll just be
a few more minutes.

61
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:42,807
Okay.

62
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:44,842
(mutters) Yeah.

63
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:47,508
(sighs)

64
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:51,592
- Gertie.
- "A Night to Remember,"

65
00:04:51,593 --> 00:04:54,307
except... and here's the catch...

66
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:58,208
with a K for a medieval theme.

67
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,707
Yeah.

68
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,608
But with a K.

69
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,707
Kurt, do you got anything?

70
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,709
"Putting on the Ritz. "

71
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:16,393
"Putting on the Ritz," yeah.

72
00:05:16,394 --> 00:05:19,109
I like that, 'cause it's simple.

73
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:24,008
What?

74
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:26,508
Gertie, we didn't...

75
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,709
we didn't vote yet.

76
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:31,609
Uh...

77
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:39,008
What do you think?
"This moment forever. "

78
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,409
(big band music playing)

79
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:46,709
(engine rattles)

80
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,809
So do you know
who you're taking yet?

81
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,509
Oh, you know, I'm just...

82
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,144
I'm just kind of waiting
to see, you know.

83
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:01,811
Just not with Camille or...

84
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:04,409
No no. No, I mean, I...

85
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,610
I've got a couple
of options I'm working on.

86
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,410
Well, there's...
there's this one girl I...

87
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,209
uh, I don't think you know her.

88
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,809
She's... well,

89
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,344
I'm just kind of waiting
for the right time to...

90
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:24,861
I mean, do you not like Camille?

91
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:28,309
Huh. No. No, she's your platonic.

92
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,110
Look, this thing's
about romance, you know?

93
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:34,945
I mean, you dress up,
you wear a flower, you slow dance.

94
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:37,062
Well yeah, you know,
I guess that's why

95
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,110
I'm trying to wait
to ask this one girl.

96
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,310
Personally, I think
it would be so cool to go.

97
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:44,510
With anyone or just...

98
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:47,245
Well, definitely not
with a hi-bye friend, no.

99
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:48,810
No. Right. Yeah.

100
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:50,710
You know,
I was telling Rhoda why

101
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,310
so many seniors are losers
and why you're not.

102
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:55,710
First off, you're definitely
more than a hi-bye friend.

103
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:59,210
And you don't
condescend to me...

104
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,410
this naive little sophomore
that you take home.

105
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:04,345
- Yeah, seniors can be...
- I've been thinking about it

106
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:06,310
and the way that I see it,

107
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:08,210
you're kind of like
your car, you know?

108
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:12,746
Seriously, your car isn't fancy
but it's not ghetto.

109
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:15,711
You're not a BMW,
you're not a Mercedes,

110
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:17,846
but you're not
a Chevy Metro either.

111
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,711
It's just this

112
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:21,411
reliable old Buick.

113
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:24,111
- (engine sputtering)
- (beeping)

114
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,896
Alice:
It doesn't need a lot of pretension.

115
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:27,711
It's not some macho machine
that has to flaunt

116
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:29,211
all its features or something.

117
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:32,311
It's just... there. It's cozy.

118
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:35,311
Anyway, could you imagine
Friedman driving this thing?

119
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:37,946
Or Buchwald?
Don't you think that's true?

120
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:39,111
(buzzes)

121
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:41,446
Don't you think your car represents
who you are in every facet?

122
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:43,412
(backfires)

123
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:48,412
(engine stops)

124
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:54,212
(squawks)

125
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:56,713
(tool whirring)

126
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:06,012
You know, I feel kind of weird

127
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:08,112
'cause you were talking
about how I'm like my car

128
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,447
- and now like...
- No, Danny, that doesn't apply now.

129
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,812
It's like if you bumped
your arm or something.

130
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:16,013
It doesn't affect your personality
when you bump your arm.

131
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,512
Don't worry about it.

132
00:08:19,513 --> 00:08:22,313
(big band music playing)

133
00:08:27,113 --> 00:08:28,648
- What? I just want to tell her...
- No no, Dad.

134
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:30,513
Shh, look, I want to hear this.

135
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:33,313
Okay, so both times I spoke
on the phone to her,

136
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:35,148
she says she doesn't
date over 40.

137
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,613
I'm 52, so I lied...

138
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:41,313
I said I was 39, but, I mean...

139
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:45,248
That's okay. I mean, yeah,
you look it anyway.

140
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:48,013
Yeah, okay,

141
00:08:48,014 --> 00:08:49,813
'cause Danny's got that also.

142
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:51,413
We both have that boyish face.

143
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:56,014
- Okay.
- Yeah, Danny definitely has that.

144
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:07,413
(chattering)

145
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:10,215
Okay, wrap it up.

146
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:16,699
Man:
I don't want to hear about it, no.

147
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,541
- Danny: Dad...
- Man: No, forget it.

148
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,414
I finally saw it
with my own eyes.

149
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:23,849
You would not believe
the signs this girl was giving him.

150
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,014
I've never seen anything like it.
It was uncanny

151
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,314
how many signs
she was giving him.

152
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:30,714
Dad, she's a tease.
You don't know.

153
00:09:30,715 --> 00:09:33,914
His problem is
he's so insecure, he's blind.

154
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:37,749
Didn't you see the way she put
her arm on your shoulder like this?

155
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,614
All the time like this.
And what's with the lips?

156
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:42,549
Every time she's looking at him,
she's licking her lips.

157
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,414
All right, whatever.
I'll ask her.

158
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:47,450
What a person does with their body
when they're looking at you...

159
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:49,515
like if she's looking at you

160
00:09:49,516 --> 00:09:51,750
and she opens up her body to you,

161
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:54,615
twirls her hair,

162
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:56,515
moves her tongue or...

163
00:09:56,516 --> 00:09:59,250
trust me on this:
This girl likes you.

164
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:01,015
I'm telling you.
She kissed you!

165
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:02,815
She probably just wants
to go as a sophomore.

166
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:05,550
- She's using me.
- Even if she did, who cares?

167
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:07,867
You're gonna have
a great picture.

168
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,150
I don't know what
he's worried about.

169
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,815
He's got so much going for him:

170
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:14,950
He's vice president of his class,
first chair in the trumpet...

171
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:16,815
- (jazz music playing)
... not to mention honor society;

172
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,715
He came in third place

173
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:22,816
at the Optimist Oratorical
Contest last year.

174
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:27,151
Mother:
Honey, did you want to meet Bob now?

175
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:29,916
Uh, just...
just give me a second.

176
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,916
Mother: Well, he's here
and he's anxious to meet you.

177
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,051
- Bob: I heard you're a real scholar.
- (record scratches)

178
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:37,316
Mother:
I told him about your award.

179
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:40,717
Bob:
I heard you're great on the trumpet.

180
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:44,317
All right,
just give me a second.

181
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:48,817
(trumpet playing)

182
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:43,118
- (knocking)
- I'll get that.

183
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:48,353
- Hey.
- It's not... it's not that big a deal,

184
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:50,518
just... here.

185
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,318
- Whatever.
- What is it?

186
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:55,918
- Hi, Camille.
- Hi, how are you?

187
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,619
- Well, who is this?
- Camille, this is Bob.

188
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,053
Bob: Any friend
of Danny's is a friend of mine.

189
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:06,519
Sincerely. I mean that.

190
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,553
- Well, I've got to run.
- Well, give my love to your family.

191
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:13,918
- (cell phone rings)
- Okay.

192
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,918
- Hello, this is Beth.
- She's a doll, that Camille.

193
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,518
- (car starts)
- And you're going to continue, right?

194
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,019
- Yeah, just, uh...
- (tires screech)

195
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,220
Oh, shit.

196
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,354
Camille's voice: "Danny, I have
a feeling you and I are thinking

197
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:42,919
the same thing here,

198
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,354
so I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

199
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:47,319
If you think back on how much

200
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,554
we've shared together
since we were little kids,

201
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:53,454
it almost seems funny
that we've avoided

202
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:56,320
the inevitable up until now. "

203
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,520
(ambulance radio chatter)

204
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,004
Camille:
"Maybe you have other plans,

205
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:05,520
and if you do,
I'll cut you some slack.

206
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:09,055
The bottom line is,
you're my best friend no matter what

207
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:11,672
and I think
it would be so much fun

208
00:13:11,673 --> 00:13:14,255
if we went together
to the prom. "

209
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:16,721
(doorbell rings)

210
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:20,255
Danny! Hi, honey.

211
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:22,120
How are you?

212
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:24,120
- Oh.
- Man: Who is that? Danny?

213
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,521
It's Danny, honey.

214
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:29,721
- Hey, Danny.
- How's it going?

215
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:33,755
- You eat dinner yet, Danny?
- I think my mom made me

216
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:35,420
- a tuna sandwich.
- What?

217
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:37,420
No, come on.
You'll have dinner with us.

218
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:39,720
No, when's the last time
you had a whole family dinner?

219
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:42,605
- (mutters)
- What? Why is that rude?

220
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:45,421
- You know Mr. Wiener?
- Mr. Wiener?

221
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:48,956
A sweet guy, a little bold. I think
I'm gonna introduce your mother to him.

222
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:51,021
- Oh yeah?
- Honey, wait.

223
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:54,156
Are you talking about that crook Wiener?
No, he's not good for Beth.

224
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:56,922
Woman: You don't think
Wiener's good for Beth?

225
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:01,321
You finally got
some sun on your cheeks.

226
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:04,556
You look good. 'Cause you know
you looked a little pale

227
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:07,821
- the last time you were here.
- How's your father?

228
00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:10,456
Woman: Ooh, yeah,
how's he doing? Has he settled in yet?

229
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:13,173
Yeah. Well, he just got
that place on the beach.

230
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:15,921
Man: Mmm,
Rashbaum showed him that property.

231
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,156
Woman:
Oh, right, on Dania Beach.

232
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,222
A nice place... simple.

233
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:23,622
So when's he moving in?

234
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:26,222
I think he's moving in in a week.

235
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:29,223
He's a good egg, your father.

236
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:33,407
Hey, Danny, do you want
to see Camille's dress?

237
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:36,622
- No no no, it's bad luck. Forget it.
- Mom.

238
00:14:36,623 --> 00:14:38,657
He's gonna see it later, anyway.
Show him the dress.

239
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:40,424
- Woman: Should I show him the dress?
- Mom!

240
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,222
What, you don't want me
to show him the dress?

241
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:45,057
Man:
It's a beautiful beautiful dress.

242
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:47,222
It's beautiful.

243
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:49,557
Danny: My parents aren't
talking to each other at all now.

244
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:52,122
It's like now
I'm in the middle of their debates

245
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:54,822
about money or it's just...

246
00:14:54,823 --> 00:14:57,523
I don't know.

247
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:04,024
We should try to get
the same dorm next year.

248
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:07,423
Look, Danny, just...

249
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:09,423
- What?
- You know what.

250
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:12,258
'Cause you're one
of my best friends, and I don't wanna...

251
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:15,058
No, I know. I just thought
'cause it's in a few weeks,

252
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:17,858
and you don't have
a confirmed date yet.

253
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:20,358
- (knocks on door)
- (door opens)

254
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:23,325
- Hey, guys.
- Oh my God.

255
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:26,323
- What?
- You are disgusting!

256
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:29,358
- What? He's like a brother.
- Get out!

257
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:32,423
Ow! Mom, Camille just
threw a marker at me!

258
00:15:32,424 --> 00:15:34,158
Shut up, Brittney!
Just get out!

259
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,923
No, you shut up,
you nerdy bitch.

260
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:37,358
- Woman: What's going on?
- She's such a little slut.

261
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,323
She's always trying
to flirt with my friends.

262
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:42,559
Oh, shut up, you geek. You wish
you could flirt with my friends.

263
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,759
(growls)
Just whatever, okay? Whatever.

264
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,324
Woman:
What is the problem?

265
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:50,724
He's taking Alice Stryer, this random
sophomore he takes to school.

266
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:52,224
Woman:
Random sophomore?

267
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:55,024
I've been building up
this relationship for a while now

268
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:57,524
and I've been waiting
to ask her.

269
00:15:57,525 --> 00:16:00,959
She's, like... I don't know. She's like
the only person I'm thinking about.

270
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,924
Seriously. Honestly.

271
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:07,425
I mean, my mind's
totally set on her.

272
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:12,424
Woman:
But you and Camille are best friends.

273
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:14,324
I mean, that's what
this is all about.

274
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:17,124
It's the culmination
of your high school memories.

275
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:20,224
I mean, who better to share
that with than your best friend?

276
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:23,560
Camille: Mom, I don't care.
He's taking someone else.

277
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:25,925
- I won't go.
- (woman gasps)

278
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:28,225
You're not going?
What do you mean you won't go?

279
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:29,960
- Man: What's going on?
- Woman: She's not going.

280
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:31,125
Man: What?

281
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:33,025
I don't mind, all right?

282
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,560
I'd mind if he was
taking Brittney.

283
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,625
- (shatters)
- It's silly.

284
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:42,510
You and Camille have known
each other for eight years.

285
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:46,525
What could this girl
possibly offer that Camille couldn't?

286
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:48,826
(doo-wop music playing)

287
00:17:03,027 --> 00:17:06,027
(people chatting)

288
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,026
You know,
I thought about it.

289
00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:12,661
Yeah, I think it could
be a lot of fun.

290
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:14,326
And, umm...

291
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:17,526
you know, I know
it's totally last second.

292
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:20,561
If you need help with a dress or
something, I could help you pay for it

293
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:24,661
because I already got
the tickets and the...

294
00:17:24,662 --> 00:17:27,027
Danny, umm...

295
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:31,827
did you think that
we were romantically...

296
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:34,726
Well, no no. I don't know.

297
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:37,461
Some signs, maybe, yeah.

298
00:17:37,462 --> 00:17:39,426
Signs?

299
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:42,028
What signs?

300
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,427
Well, I guess now, here,

301
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:47,727
with the ice cream.

302
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:49,827
Wait, the ice cream?

303
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:52,427
You weren't
just looking at me,

304
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:54,312
licking the ice cream and like...

305
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,227
Yeah, Danny,
I was looking at you

306
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:58,412
and I was licking
my ice cream.

307
00:17:58,413 --> 00:18:00,627
This is how
I eat my ice cream.

308
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:02,728
I mean, how do you eat
your ice cream?

309
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:06,627
Uh, last week
you kissed me.

310
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,327
- I mean, you know...
- Yeah, you're a big brother to me.

311
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:12,228
You take me to school.
You're my carpool.

312
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:15,762
Well, I... well,
you said you wanted to go.

313
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:18,762
- I thought you were...
- Yeah, but...

314
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:21,928
- not...
- I don't understand.

315
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:25,528
- You can't go with a friend.
- That's just so weird.

316
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:27,728
This is, like,
the total "Twilight Zone. "

317
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:32,063
Danny, I just can't believe that
you thought that.

318
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:34,128
Huh.

319
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:38,029
That is just so deranged.

320
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:47,129
- (door opens, closes)
- (bell jingles)

321
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,229
How was she licking?
'Cause if she was

322
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,029
showing her tongue
but not looking at you...

323
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,530
No, Dad, she was
looking at me.

324
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,429
She doesn't have
that wandering eye thing?

325
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,864
- 'Cause that can be tricky.
- Dad, she doesn't have that.

326
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:14,329
Well, what about the feet?

327
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,564
No, just hear me out, 'cause
the feet can cancel all other signs.

328
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:21,064
If her toes are pointed
toward the door,

329
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:22,929
that cancels all other signs.

330
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,029
Dad, I wasn't watching
her toes, all right?

331
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,929
Look, she could've been
doing that in the car ride,

332
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,429
'cause I couldn't see her feet.

333
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,464
Also, she buckled
her seat belt at one point,

334
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:37,230
so that could've been
a guarded gesture.

335
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:40,031
Thank you.

336
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:45,831
Whoops, I think he has to
go to the bathroom here.

337
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:49,731
- Sure, of course.
- (baby crying)

338
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:56,330
All right,
just a quick side note here:

339
00:19:56,331 --> 00:19:59,530
- What do you think?
- Dad, I don't know, all right?

340
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,230
I'm not gonna lie to you. This baby
thing is a major pain in the ass,

341
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:05,630
but attractive, intelligent,

342
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:09,630
fun and she's got
a nice behind on her.

343
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:12,530
I mean what do you think?
You're an ass man.

344
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:14,330
- Dad.
- What?

345
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:16,630
- It's weird.
- What? What's weird?

346
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:20,032
It's weird advising my dad
on his girlfriend's ass.

347
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:24,932
It's not natural.
I've got my own crisis here.

348
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,431
Danny...

349
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:29,631
it's the times, okay?

350
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:32,731
Everybody's
going through this.

351
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,231
I mean most kids are
advising their parents these days.

352
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:38,266
(truck starts)

353
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:40,732
(tires screeching)

354
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:47,866
Danny:
I pledge allegiance to the flag

355
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:50,531
of the United States of America,

356
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:52,966
and to the Republic
for which it stands,

357
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,931
one nation under God,

358
00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:57,732
indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.

359
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:00,633
Will everyone
please be seated?

360
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,017
"Want to remember
your prom night forever?

361
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:08,609
You can, by capturing
that perfect moment

362
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,232
with a prom photo.
Preorder your photos

363
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,733
from the hours
of 12:00 and 1:00."

364
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:16,667
"Congratulations are
in order to Dawn Dwiggins

365
00:21:16,668 --> 00:21:18,632
for being crowned
this year's prom queen.

366
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:22,832
Varsity cheerleader
Dawn exemplifies true school spirit

and gives her time generously

Craig:
Kaplan.

370
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,532
- Klebener.
- Girl: Who do we know at Nova?

371
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:38,568
- Craig: Klinger.
- Girl: Has to be someone at Nova.

372
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:40,533
- Who?
- I'm thinking.

373
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:44,333
- Koch. Kushner.
- Wait a minute. I've got it.

374
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:46,633
Danny, you so owe me.

375
00:21:46,634 --> 00:21:50,133
There's no one cute
at No... dude.

376
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:52,533
Am I right? You remember
that boyfriend of hers?

377
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:55,968
Was he anything?
Hey, Marcy, what's up?

378
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:58,285
You did? No.

379
00:21:58,286 --> 00:22:00,533
You horndog.

380
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:02,233
We have to click,
though, right?

381
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:03,933
No. He didn't.

382
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:06,068
Well, anyway,
we've got a new guy for you.

383
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:07,433
Yeah, Craig's friend.

384
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:09,033
He just broke it off
with his girlfriend

385
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:11,533
and he just wants someone
to go to the prom with,

386
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:13,268
you know,
someone who can totally party.

387
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:16,834
Yeah, he's... blue eyes, tall.

388
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,834
Yeah, he's cute... like quirky cute.

389
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:24,534
Yeah. Yeah?

390
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:27,669
All right. So you'll just go
in the limo with us

391
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,834
and we'll totally pre-party.
Yeah, totally.

392
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:34,034
Yeah, I've been tanning
for three weeks now.

393
00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:35,634
Find out what time...

394
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:38,434
Okay, yeah, he'll take you
to dinner. Yeah.

395
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:41,334
Just call me afterwards
if you want to back out,

396
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:44,519
- so there's no pressure.
- See, there's the fine print.

397
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,669
Okay, 7:00 at Padrino's.
I'll tell him to make reservations.

398
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,534
Yeah, 7:00 sharp.
Call me afterwards, all right?

399
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,334
All right. Bye.

400
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:53,834
- (cell phone clicks)
- Craig: Score.

401
00:22:53,835 --> 00:22:56,235
You're going
with Marcy Pine, dude.

402
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:58,835
- Wait, she still has to see me.
- Girl: Just look nice...

403
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,670
wear one of Craig's vests
or something... and just be yourself.

404
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,735
Craig:
Yeah, just be yourself.

405
00:23:02,736 --> 00:23:05,336
Yeah, and whatever you do,
don't be late.

406
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:29,836
You wait, right?

407
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:40,636
Honey, I don't like that table.

408
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:43,736
Go find us a nice one...
not too cold.

409
00:23:43,737 --> 00:23:46,637
- Of course.
- Oh, you're kidding.

410
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:51,036
Danny? Was I not
just asking about him?

411
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:53,736
- Just about.
- Hi, honey.

412
00:23:53,737 --> 00:23:56,936
Hey, how are you?
Who are you here with?

413
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:59,371
You know, I'm just
waiting for a friend.

414
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,436
- Oh.
- Oh, someone we know?

415
00:24:01,437 --> 00:24:04,636
Uh, no, he's just kind of
like an old friend.

416
00:24:04,637 --> 00:24:06,936
Oh, gee,
look who's here... Wilentz.

417
00:24:06,937 --> 00:24:09,771
Woman:
Oh, you're kidding. Who's he with?

418
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:11,636
Hold on. I'll be right there.

419
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:14,337
- Camille's supposed to meet us here...
- Camille?

420
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:16,837
- and I just want to talk
to you before she comes.

421
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:19,672
- I should probably check outside.
- I just want you to know

422
00:24:19,673 --> 00:24:22,472
that you don't have
to worry about any sort of ego thing

423
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:24,637
if you ask her now.
She'll still go with you.

424
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:28,337
Her sister was even
asked to this thing,

425
00:24:28,338 --> 00:24:31,737
and the whole thing is
so humiliating for her.

426
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:33,337
I'm just...
let me just go see

427
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,438
if my friend's here.
I'll be right back.

428
00:24:37,638 --> 00:24:40,038
Marcy?

429
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:42,772
- Oh shit.
- Camille: Danny.

430
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,737
Camille, how's it going?

431
00:24:44,738 --> 00:24:47,937
This is so weird.
Are you eating here?

432
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:50,237
Yeah, I was just talking
to your mother inside.

433
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,772
- I think she's waiting for you.
- Who are you here with?

434
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:54,938
I'm meeting a friend.

435
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:58,238
- Do I know him?
- Uh, no.

436
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:01,273
No, he's just kind of
like an old camp friend, you know?

437
00:25:01,274 --> 00:25:03,639
Oh yeah, like a camp counselor
or something?

438
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:08,939
Yeah, some dude.

439
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:18,073
- Was your mom expecting you now?
- Camille: She can wait.

440
00:25:18,074 --> 00:25:20,539
Danny:
Yeah, she can, but...

441
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,239
Camille:
Oh, I was gonna ask you:

442
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,839
What did you put for
where hydroxide ion is highest at?

443
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,839
Uh, I think I skipped that one.

444
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,074
Why did you skip that one?
You had like a 50/50 chance.

445
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:47,639
Uh, well, I don't know.

446
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,640
'Cause I put
"at a high pH number. "

447
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,774
Uh, excuse me.
Do you guys have the time?

448
00:25:55,775 --> 00:25:59,174
Um, yes, it's 10 after 7:00.

449
00:25:59,175 --> 00:26:01,740
Son of a bitch.

450
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,240
Camille: Yikes.

451
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,539
(car starts, revs loudly)

452
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,840
- (tires screech)
- Danny: What do you mean she won't?

453
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:14,640
I was there. I...

454
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:17,841
Disrespectful? I was just
gonna be a few more minutes.

455
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,440
All right.

456
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:25,541
- Okay, fine.
- (phone beeps)

457
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:31,641
I got a room.
Maynard got one.

458
00:26:32,141 --> 00:26:34,375
- Sternberg.
- Lipschitz?

459
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:36,392
Lipschitz, yeah.
Buchwald.

460
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:38,301
- Buchwald?
- Buchwald.

461
00:26:38,302 --> 00:26:40,240
- Bart and...
- No. Wait.

462
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:42,075
- What?
- Bart?

463
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:43,840
- Yeah.
- Bart?!

464
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:45,740
- Why?
- Bart got a room?

465
00:26:45,741 --> 00:26:47,940
Dude, get a room.
What's your problem?

466
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,640
When you find your date,
you're gonna want one

467
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,541
- at least as a place to crash.
- To crash, yeah.

468
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:55,576
Believe me, you'll want a room.
The whole world's getting rooms.

469
00:26:55,577 --> 00:26:58,341
Honey, do you want to skip
a day from your tanning

470
00:26:58,342 --> 00:27:00,241
and go to the zoo
with Harry and me?

471
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:03,641
- You hate the zoo.
- I like it now.

472
00:27:03,642 --> 00:27:06,441
Craig: I can't.
The thing's in three weeks.

473
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:09,341
All right.
Just checking.

474
00:27:09,342 --> 00:27:11,441
My mom's getting
like that too.

475
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:13,741
Yeah, it takes about
a year to adjust...

476
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:16,741
- you know, basic family transition.
- (cell phone beeps)

477
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:19,876
Babe, I'm thinking the limo
should go to Stein's first.

478
00:27:19,877 --> 00:27:23,041
- How much is that gonna be now?
- How much for the limo?

479
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,741
- Apiece.
- $400, right?

480
00:27:24,742 --> 00:27:27,376
- Apiece?!
- $400 for the six of us.

481
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:29,941
- Six of us?
- Well, if we can't get it,

482
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:32,377
we won't do it. I mean,
there's always getting drunk.

483
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:35,342
'Cause I mean
that's $135, right?

484
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:37,342
Well, do you want me to get it?

485
00:27:37,343 --> 00:27:40,042
Because I can try to get it
and if we can't get it, we won't do it.

486
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:42,177
- That's... I mean, dude...
- Yeah, Stein and his date's

487
00:27:42,178 --> 00:27:45,743
gonna drink with us too. Yes.

488
00:27:46,343 --> 00:27:48,877
Hon, hon, hon,
I'm telling you...

489
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:51,542
drinking is still good.

490
00:27:51,543 --> 00:27:53,877
Beth:
Your father should be doing this.

491
00:27:53,878 --> 00:27:56,242
Danny:
He's doing the tickets and the tux.

492
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:58,242
Well, I'm sorry,
but a room here and a limo

493
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,542
is a lot more than
a cheap tux and two tickets.

494
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:02,642
Well, who says
I'm getting a cheap tux?

495
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:04,942
Believe me, with your father
you're getting the cheapest.

496
00:28:04,943 --> 00:28:08,542
- Well, then can you talk to him?
- I'm not talking to him.

497
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:11,043
Mom, can't you guys
just work it out?

498
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:14,478
No, 'cause I'm gonna be
out $330 for this thing

499
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:16,843
and he's out... what?... $200.

500
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:19,843
You need to tell your father
he needs to take on the limo too.

501
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:21,678
- Seriously, because I can't...
- Mom, please.

502
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,944
- He doesn't have it.
- (sighs)

503
00:28:26,644 --> 00:28:29,643
Truth is, you shouldn't be
getting a hotel room.

504
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:32,078
- I never got a room.
- Mom, wouldn't you rather know

505
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,478
that I'm safe here rather
than out on the road afterward,

506
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,343
driving around exhausted?

507
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:38,143
I thought that's
why you have a limo.

508
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:40,043
Well, yeah, but it's not like
we're out on the street...

509
00:28:40,044 --> 00:28:43,243
look, Mom, everyone is getting
a room here at the Embassy Suites,

510
00:28:43,244 --> 00:28:45,343
all right?
Sherman, Wilentz...

511
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:48,678
- it's not a big deal.
- It is when your father doesn't help.

512
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:51,979
- (phone ringing)
- Mom...

513
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,944
Bart got a room.

514
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:56,679
- Bart got a room?
- Hi, can I help you?

515
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,444
We need a room...

516
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,744
- For the 15th.
... for the 15th, please.

517
00:29:00,745 --> 00:29:03,545
- Single? Double?
- Single. Single?

518
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:07,244
Anyway, Bob's coming
over tomorrow.

519
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,029
He's taking us out
for a nice Italian,

520
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,779
and then we're taking
a walk on the beach.

521
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,844
The beach? With Bob?

522
00:29:12,845 --> 00:29:14,844
Honey, do you want
your mom to have

523
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:17,545
some financial stability
in her life or not?

524
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:23,745
(chalk clacking)

525
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:29,580
All right, I'm going to be reading
some of your journal entries

526
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:33,345
and I'm not going to tell you
who wrote them until the end, okay?

527
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:34,845
(paper rustles)

528
00:29:34,846 --> 00:29:37,845
"Lost in the ocean,
the waves carry me free,

529
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:40,846
the sea kelp caressing
my sensitive bosom.

530
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:45,780
Take my fragile floating nakedness
to the warmest blues.

531
00:29:45,781 --> 00:29:48,080
Make me blush
with your splashes,

532
00:29:48,081 --> 00:29:49,745
your crashes

533
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,745
your flume, spume,

534
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:53,645
your white bubbly breath,

535
00:29:53,646 --> 00:29:55,445
your sensitive touches.

536
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:59,245
Fill my every essence
and I shall shiver with ecstasy,

537
00:29:59,246 --> 00:30:02,745
splashing forever
upon your delicate face. "

541
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:16,381
"This great big silence,
like an empty void,

542
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:18,946
like as if nothing ever mattered,

543
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,946
like as if nobody ever cared.

544
00:30:20,947 --> 00:30:23,846
Where could it go,
the respect of two people

545
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:27,131
who laughed all the time,
who were forever a team?

546
00:30:27,132 --> 00:30:30,423
So unappreciated
is the serenity before the fall,

547
00:30:30,424 --> 00:30:33,681
before the fierce winds
of doubt come to call.

548
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:35,946
Often I feel alone,

549
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:38,946
split in two,
yearning for my family

550
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:43,247
when my life is so new. "

(bell ringing)

553
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:04,347
I don't understand.
After class she asked you to dinner

554
00:31:04,348 --> 00:31:08,682
- from a journal entry?
- Well, no, I asked her to study first.

555
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:11,247
And then she asked you
to dinner?

556
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:14,047
With her whole family,
so I mean...

557
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:16,747
I think she felt bad for me
or something. I don't really know.

558
00:31:16,748 --> 00:31:19,782
- Amazing. You need my car?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

559
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:21,482
And if you want
to take her back here...

560
00:31:21,483 --> 00:31:24,247
No, she invited me to her place.

561
00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:26,682
'Cause, you know, I want you
to feel like this is your place.

562
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:28,448
Yeah, no, that's all right.

563
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:30,848
In fact, I'm getting you
an extra set of keys

564
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:33,983
in case you ever want
to take a girl back here for whatever.

565
00:31:33,984 --> 00:31:36,550
That's why I got
a whole separate room.

566
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:39,083
Well, the walls are
kind of thin though.

567
00:31:39,084 --> 00:31:41,048
- Thin?
- Well, I mean,

568
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:43,583
you could probably hear
everything in the other room.

569
00:31:43,584 --> 00:31:46,648
No no no,
these are good walls.

570
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:49,348
Well, you know,
if you had a woman too,

571
00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:51,483
- it could just be kind of weird.
- Well, if she were screaming,

572
00:31:51,484 --> 00:31:53,350
but I think it would be
pretty quiet.

573
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:55,248
Or I could just take off,
I could leave.

574
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:56,848
No, you shouldn't
have to leave.

575
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,648
Well, go in the other room
and let's see,

576
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:01,183
- 'cause I want you to come by a lot.
- In the other room?

577
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:03,748
Yeah, close the door, make sounds
like you're with someone

578
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:06,249
and I'll sort of...

579
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,534
(door opens, closes)

All right?

581
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,449
- Danny: Well?
- You did it?

582
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:18,449
- Yeah.
- All right. No, I was talking.

583
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,450
Do it again.

584
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,150
Ah.

585
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,349
This time do it at different levels.

586
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,949
Ah.

587
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,649
Like start soft

588
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,249
and then get...

589
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,849
start soft
and then go up.

590
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,034
Well, I did it twice already.

591
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:41,249
- At different levels?
- Yeah.

592
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,349
All right, look.
I'm gonna call out

593
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:46,485
one to 10 and I'll get
louder each time.

594
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:48,150
My one will sound like this...

595
00:32:48,151 --> 00:32:51,150
- (softly) ah. All right?
- Yeah.

596
00:32:51,151 --> 00:32:52,950
You tell me
what number you hear me at.

597
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:55,235
All right, just make sure
your numbers are even,

598
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:57,550
- so it's like a control.
- How do you mean?

599
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:59,350
Announcer the number
at an even volume.

600
00:32:59,351 --> 00:33:01,751
Oh, good.

601
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:05,250
- (door closes)
- All right.

602
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:07,150
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

603
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,650
All right, don't respond now.

604
00:33:08,651 --> 00:33:11,851
Just hold out until
I've completely finished.

605
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:14,785
(loudly) One.
(softly) Ooh.

606
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,950
Two.

607
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:18,950
Oh.

608
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:22,650
Three. Ooh.

609
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:26,051
Four. Oh yeah.

610
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:29,451
Five.
Oh, that's it. That's it.

611
00:33:29,452 --> 00:33:33,351
Six. Oh my God.
Oh my God, don't stop.

612
00:33:33,352 --> 00:33:37,951
Seven. Oh. Oh my... oh.

613
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:40,551
Oh my. Eight.

614
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,886
Don't stop. Don't stop.

615
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:46,151
Don't stop. Nine.

616
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:50,351
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

617
00:33:50,352 --> 00:33:54,451
10. Give it to me!
Give it to me!

618
00:33:54,452 --> 00:33:58,252
- Give it to me!
- (car starts)

619
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:18,537
Beth: Well, I showed
the house three times last week.

620
00:34:18,538 --> 00:34:21,952
I know things are a little...
they're a little slow,

621
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:24,387
but I'm sure after the open house
we're gonna have some buyers.

622
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:26,252
- Hi, it's so good to see you.
- I know.

623
00:34:26,253 --> 00:34:28,352
You just tell that adorable Maxipoo

624
00:34:28,353 --> 00:34:30,987
- I send my love.
- Your mom's over here.

625
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:33,987
Okay? All right.
Bye, darling.

626
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,552
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

627
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:37,052
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

628
00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:39,352
Why? What do you mean?
It's Sunday...

629
00:34:39,353 --> 00:34:42,152
- Japanese or Italian.
- I can't. I'm having dinner

630
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:43,988
and studying for a trig test
with a classmate, okay?

631
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:47,253
Hi, Lola. Which property?

632
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:49,288
(whispers)
Did you see these?

633
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:51,288
This is the third time this week

634
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,253
he's sent me e-roses.

635
00:34:53,254 --> 00:34:55,088
(normal voice)
I will see you at 3:00, okay?

636
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:57,353
All right, bye.

637
00:34:57,354 --> 00:34:58,753
Mom, I've got to run, okay?

638
00:34:58,754 --> 00:35:00,588
We'll just take
Dad's Wednesday next week.

639
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:02,388
Are you asking
this study partner to the prom?

640
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:04,453
- Shh.
- Oh, I guessed it.

641
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:06,453
Don't worry, I won't jinx it.
Who is she?

642
00:35:06,454 --> 00:35:08,653
- You don't know her.
- Do I know her family?

643
00:35:08,654 --> 00:35:11,253
I'm pretty sure no.

644
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:14,154
(people speaking Chinese)

645
00:35:53,655 --> 00:35:55,655
Eat.

646
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:02,856
Eat.

647
00:36:19,156 --> 00:36:21,356
So, um...

648
00:36:22,156 --> 00:36:25,356
I'm not really good
with these kinds of things.

649
00:36:26,456 --> 00:36:28,256
I, uh...

650
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:31,090
You need a date for the prom.

651
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:33,355
How did... yeah.

652
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:35,890
Yeah, I'll go with you.

653
00:36:35,891 --> 00:36:38,355
You will? Are you serious?

654
00:36:38,356 --> 00:36:40,990
- Really?
- I had a feeling you were gonna ask.

655
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,591
- I think we'd have a good time.
- Totally.

656
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:46,357
Totally. Yeah yeah.

657
00:36:47,057 --> 00:36:49,856
I do have to keep it
a secret though,

658
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:51,456
since my parents would
never want me to go.

659
00:36:51,457 --> 00:36:54,456
No, I totally understand, yeah.

660
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:57,191
We could sneak
you out or something.

661
00:36:57,192 --> 00:36:59,856
And this really isn't a big deal,

662
00:36:59,857 --> 00:37:02,591
but I do have
this long-distance relationship,

663
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,256
so we couldn't get intimate

664
00:37:04,257 --> 00:37:05,891
on the dance floor or anything...

665
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:07,756
No, right, yeah, of course.

666
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:10,556
...'cause that could
always get back to him.

667
00:37:10,557 --> 00:37:14,656
In case people might see
that and tell him, yeah,

668
00:37:14,657 --> 00:37:16,656
on the dance floor.

669
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:19,556
And I wouldn't want
to take any pictures

670
00:37:19,557 --> 00:37:22,557
'cause they could always
get in the wrong hands.

671
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:24,057
I mean if he saw that...

672
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:26,658
Yeah, right. That's...

673
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:29,242
well, even if you held

674
00:37:29,243 --> 00:37:31,257
the negatives and...

675
00:37:31,258 --> 00:37:34,057
And actually, in general,

676
00:37:34,058 --> 00:37:36,457
I wouldn't want to be seen
walking in together.

677
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:40,457
In fact, I'd rather not
be seen walking around at all,

678
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,592
just in case.

679
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,657
So, like...

680
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:48,292
But, I mean, we could
always meet up afterwards

681
00:37:48,293 --> 00:37:50,558
at some post-party
in someone's room...

682
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,892
'cause I think Bart got a room.

683
00:37:53,893 --> 00:37:57,157
(gong peals)

684
00:37:57,158 --> 00:37:59,458
(kids chatting)

685
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:17,293
Camille's voice:
"Danny, you're my best friend

686
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,293
and I just think
it would be so much fun

687
00:38:19,294 --> 00:38:22,659
if we went together
to the prom. "

688
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:28,958
"Guess what's around the corner.

689
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:30,758
Prom.

690
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:32,993
The senior class is
looking for suggestions

691
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:34,458
for original party favors.

692
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:37,758
Past favors included
candy baskets and pens.

693
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:42,059
Come to room 403
to cast your vote. "

694
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,094
"There's romance in the air.
Can you feel it?

695
00:38:45,095 --> 00:38:46,959
Don't wait till the night of prom

696
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,094
to give your special someone
a special treat.

697
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:50,959
Show her how much
you really care

698
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,260
with a Spring-gram. "

699
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,359
The way I see it, I think
this Camille can be your decoy

700
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,559
to get other women.
What do you think about that?

701
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,759
Mom, I just saw
a lizard in the house.

702
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,794
It's fine.
They eat ants. It's fine.

703
00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:06,759
Look. See, look here.

704
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,294
Scott Cecil...
he was nothing special.

705
00:39:10,295 --> 00:39:13,759
Wow, you look different...
your face.

706
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,659
Okay. Anyway, Camille is
your best friend, so...

707
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,159
Hey hey hey,

708
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
I don't want to forget
the gift I got Danny.

709
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:23,060
- Hold on.
- (whispers) Why did he get me a gift?

710
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:26,095
(whispers) I don't know.
I think he's thinking about...

711
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:29,461
- Proposing?
- Shh. Please, don't...

712
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:33,860
- Here.
- Thank you.

713
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:36,795
- What is it?
- Go ahead and open it.

714
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:39,760
I figured you needed one, so...

715
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:41,845
Oh, isn't that thoughtful?

716
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,860
Yeah, well, thank you.

717
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:45,560
I figured it would
save you some money.

718
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:47,995
It'll save his father some money.

719
00:39:47,996 --> 00:39:50,460
Okay, well, let's get going.

720
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:52,661
Bye, Danny.

721
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:55,861
Yeah, have a good time.

722
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:00,262
(blues music playing)

723
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,064
(knocks on door)

724
00:41:53,964 --> 00:41:56,164
Hey, kid.

725
00:41:57,164 --> 00:41:59,399
I didn't know
if you had company or not.

726
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,065
No. No no no no.
What's up?

727
00:42:04,365 --> 00:42:06,599
What if we're supposed
to be happy with the middle ground?

728
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,764
Just what if...

729
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:10,464
now hear me out on this...

730
00:42:10,465 --> 00:42:12,499
what if we're supposed
to find peace

731
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,464
and a little boredom,
you know?

732
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,764
Maybe that's better than always
having to search for something else.

733
00:42:16,765 --> 00:42:19,364
I mean, really,

734
00:42:19,365 --> 00:42:22,049
what's wrong
with a little boredom?

735
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,764
Would you like
some Cherry Garcia?

736
00:42:24,765 --> 00:42:27,164
(car revs in distance)

737
00:42:27,165 --> 00:42:30,599
I've got that,
I've got Chubby Hubby.

738
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,499
Dad, are you listening?

739
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,064
'Cause, like...

740
00:42:35,065 --> 00:42:37,600
what if you and mom
just stuck it out,

741
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:40,065
even if it was boring
after a while?

742
00:42:40,066 --> 00:42:42,100
You guys would still be together,
don't you think?

743
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,465
I'm giving you Chubby Hubby.

744
00:42:43,466 --> 00:42:44,965
It's got pretzels, all right?

745
00:42:44,966 --> 00:42:48,165
Yeah, but seriously,
what's the deal?

746
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:51,765
It's complex. There was
nothing keeping us together.

747
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:56,200
Look, every kid wishes
their parents get back together,

748
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:58,866
but it's not realistic.
We've moved on.

749
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:04,365
Anyway, I've decided
I'm gonna ask Camille.

750
00:43:04,366 --> 00:43:07,700
I figure we can always just hang out
and play Boggle in the room after.

751
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:09,665
Boggle's good.

752
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:11,765
At least you get to go.
I never went.

753
00:43:11,766 --> 00:43:15,400
She's my best friend.
I know at the very least we'll have fun.

754
00:43:15,401 --> 00:43:18,067
Look, having a date is good.

755
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:24,066
Anyway, we don't have to
pay for a bowtie now, so...

756
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:26,066
How's that?

757
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:29,666
No, well, Bob got me one.

758
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,866
What?

759
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:34,766
This Bob guy
got you a bowtie?

760
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:37,201
I'm getting you a bowtie,
thank you very much.

761
00:43:37,202 --> 00:43:38,966
Yeah, well, he got me one,

762
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:40,966
so now we don't have to
get a cheap one.

763
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:43,966
No no no, I'm getting you
a very nice bowtie.

764
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:47,467
What, this Bob guy is
your father all of a sudden?

765
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,567
Well, Mom thinks
he might propose.

766
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:54,667
(opera music playing)

767
00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:58,202
So I've got this new woman
I'm excited about.

768
00:43:58,203 --> 00:44:00,667
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, we're compatible.

769
00:44:00,668 --> 00:44:02,402
She's not at all materialistic.

770
00:44:02,403 --> 00:44:04,967
She's into camping.

771
00:44:04,968 --> 00:44:08,268
- That's cool. Any kids?
- Two kids, both married.

772
00:44:11,168 --> 00:44:13,167
Yeah, so...

773
00:44:13,168 --> 00:44:16,167
I haven't actually seen her yet,

774
00:44:16,168 --> 00:44:19,602
but she described herself
to me, so, you know.

775
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:22,419
- Does she sound nice?
- Yeah.

776
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,202
I haven't actually heard her yet.

777
00:44:25,203 --> 00:44:27,268
This was on the internet.

778
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:29,767
- Chat room?
- Mm-hmm.

779
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:32,067
- Fast typer?
- Yeah, pretty fast.

780
00:44:32,068 --> 00:44:34,767
- Well, that's cool.
- Yeah.

781
00:44:34,768 --> 00:44:36,768
I'll see her
in a couple of nights.

782
00:44:36,769 --> 00:44:39,168
You know, she may
turn out to be hideous,

783
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:41,769
but at this point...
you know.

784
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:45,768
- All right, here we go.
- Good, try it on.

785
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:48,469
Come with me.

786
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:52,903
Beth:
Thanks for trying it on for us.

787
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:54,468
Bob:
Hon, we've gotta get going.

788
00:44:54,469 --> 00:44:56,368
We've got that court
reserved at noon.

789
00:44:56,369 --> 00:44:59,103
- Beth: What time is the limo coming?
- 7:00. Mrs. Goodson said

790
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:01,468
she's gonna keep Camille
at the house until I get there.

791
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,268
It's gonna be a big surprise.

792
00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:05,868
I figure it'll at least keep
some sort of special...

793
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,868
Bob:
I can't wait anymore. I'm coming in.

794
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:10,569
(door rattles)

795
00:45:11,169 --> 00:45:15,369
Oh. Oh, yeah
yeah yeah yeah.

796
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:19,204
- Oh, you look really sharp.
- You look so handsome.

797
00:45:19,205 --> 00:45:20,921
Whoa. Camille's gonna
be so impressed.

798
00:45:20,922 --> 00:45:22,569
Honey, why don't you
go start the car

799
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,504
- and I'll be out in one second?
- Hey, listen.

800
00:45:24,505 --> 00:45:27,469
You have a good time.

801
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:29,604
Enjoy it.
You deserve it.

802
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:32,270
- Okay.
- Thank you.

803
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,369
I think he's gonna
propose tonight.

804
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,169
- What? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

805
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,069
- Are you gonna say yes?
- Look, he's financially secure,

806
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,404
he's got a big heart
and I'm 43.

807
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:44,469
- 45.
- 44.

808
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:47,004
And you hang it up
so it doesn't wrinkle,

809
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:48,721
your corsage is in the fridge.

810
00:45:48,722 --> 00:45:50,404
When are you picking up Camille?

811
00:45:50,405 --> 00:45:52,269
- 7:15.
- Oh, gosh.

812
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:55,105
Have an amazing time. She's your
best friend. You're gonna have fun.

813
00:45:55,106 --> 00:45:57,971
Okay, have fun.

814
00:45:58,771 --> 00:46:01,271
(shower running)

815
00:46:18,971 --> 00:46:21,370
- Craig.
- What's up, dude?

816
00:46:21,371 --> 00:46:23,170
I was calling.
Your phone's off.

817
00:46:23,171 --> 00:46:26,070
- Yeah, I know.
- Anyway,

818
00:46:26,071 --> 00:46:28,270
I've decided I'm just
gonna accept my fate.

819
00:46:28,271 --> 00:46:31,270
Camille and I, we're gonna
have a good time. We will.

820
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:34,206
We'll get drunk, make fun of people...
good, clean fun.

821
00:46:34,207 --> 00:46:36,723
Anyway, I'm thinking
that when the limo comes,

822
00:46:36,724 --> 00:46:39,271
I can swing by hers first
and surprise her.

823
00:46:39,272 --> 00:46:43,506
We'll just come by and pick you
and Abby up at 7:30, all right?

824
00:46:43,507 --> 00:46:46,871
Well, you can't do that now.

825
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:49,306
- What do you mean?
- Well, you can't go with her now.

826
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:51,271
I'm going with her now.

827
00:46:51,272 --> 00:46:53,206
Yeah, right.
You're going with Abby.

828
00:46:53,207 --> 00:46:55,171
No, Abby can't go,
so I asked Camille.

829
00:46:55,172 --> 00:46:57,256
What do you mean
she can't go?

830
00:46:57,257 --> 00:46:59,271
She got these
bad sun blisters.

831
00:46:59,272 --> 00:47:01,671
- Sun blisters?
- Yeah, it hurts her to move.

832
00:47:01,672 --> 00:47:04,571
So wait, I don't... you what?

833
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,171
- Sorry, I didn't realize...
- Are you serious?

834
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:10,406
- You asked Camille?
- You weren't gonna go with her.

835
00:47:10,407 --> 00:47:14,872
And besides,
I happen to think she's attractive,

836
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,873
you know,
in a quirky sort of way.

837
00:47:19,573 --> 00:47:23,472
I'm sorry, dude,
I didn't think you were gonna ask her.

838
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,707
Well, what about that
nonrefundable deposit

839
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:27,072
my mom put down
on the limo?

840
00:47:27,073 --> 00:47:29,907
Well, we didn't talk
about that for a while,

841
00:47:29,908 --> 00:47:32,373
so I just assumed
you'd canceled it.

842
00:47:33,973 --> 00:47:36,473
I'm sorry.

843
00:47:37,073 --> 00:47:38,607
Listen, dude,
I've gotta get ready.

844
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:40,973
This is a big night for me.

845
00:47:42,073 --> 00:47:45,673
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi.

846
00:48:05,274 --> 00:48:07,774
(squawks)

847
00:48:36,075 --> 00:48:38,074
- Did you get it?
- Huh?

848
00:48:38,075 --> 00:48:41,075
- Camille: One two three.
- Camille?

849
00:48:43,275 --> 00:48:45,509
Can I talk to you for a second?

850
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:48,175
Sorry, Danny, I didn't know.

851
00:48:54,775 --> 00:48:58,774
So you're going
with Craig now?

852
00:48:58,775 --> 00:49:02,275
Yeah, he's gonna be by
in half an hour.

853
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:05,074
We're going as friends.

854
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,375
That's great.

855
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:10,575
It's pretty much set, huh?

856
00:49:12,176 --> 00:49:16,376
- I'm sorry.
- No no no, I'm sorry.

857
00:49:17,776 --> 00:49:19,775
I've got like $600
in this thing now

858
00:49:19,776 --> 00:49:22,060
between the limo, the tux,

859
00:49:22,061 --> 00:49:24,152
the corsage, the tickets

860
00:49:24,153 --> 00:49:26,275
and this hotel room I got.

861
00:49:26,276 --> 00:49:27,875
You said
you were going alone

862
00:49:27,876 --> 00:49:29,910
and I was going to surprise you.
I mean I wanted to...

863
00:49:29,911 --> 00:49:31,876
Oh, well...

864
00:49:32,576 --> 00:49:35,576
I've got a date now.

865
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:38,910
You said in your card
you were gonna wait.

866
00:49:38,911 --> 00:49:41,475
Well, Danny,

867
00:49:41,476 --> 00:49:44,510
did you expect me to wait
for you like some puppet?

868
00:49:44,511 --> 00:49:46,575
Well, no, but I mean...

869
00:49:46,576 --> 00:49:49,075
Did you honestly think
that if I was given the opportunity,

870
00:49:49,076 --> 00:49:50,876
I wasn't going to take it,

871
00:49:50,877 --> 00:49:55,076
especially in response
to your deceit?

872
00:49:55,077 --> 00:49:57,411
Deceit? What are you talking about?
I was honest with you

873
00:49:57,412 --> 00:50:00,077
- from the beginning.
- Bullshit you were honest.

874
00:50:01,677 --> 00:50:05,077
You told me you only had eyes
for that stupid sophomore.

875
00:50:08,277 --> 00:50:10,411
You just don't want
to go with me.

876
00:50:10,412 --> 00:50:12,676
No no, that's... no.

877
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:15,376
I actually wanted to go
with you from the start.

878
00:50:15,377 --> 00:50:18,376
Craig, he was
brainwashing me. He was...

879
00:50:18,377 --> 00:50:21,477
God, you're in control
of your own life.

880
00:50:23,577 --> 00:50:25,576
Look...

881
00:50:25,577 --> 00:50:28,411
I really have to go, okay?

882
00:50:28,412 --> 00:50:30,378
I know.

883
00:50:32,378 --> 00:50:34,778
Anyway...

884
00:50:35,578 --> 00:50:38,078
you look really nice.

885
00:50:40,178 --> 00:50:42,177
I guess...

886
00:50:42,178 --> 00:50:44,978
I mean... I just wish...

887
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:49,778
I'm sorry.

888
00:50:51,378 --> 00:50:53,478
Yeah.

889
00:50:54,078 --> 00:50:56,778
- (watch beeps)
- Oh shit.

890
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:12,178
(squeaking loudly)

891
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:14,679
(rattling)

892
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,979
(phone beeps)

893
00:51:43,379 --> 00:51:45,878
Minda, hey, it's Danny Stein.
Do you remember me?

894
00:51:45,879 --> 00:51:47,978
No, we met
at that debate tournament

895
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,779
and you were making fun
of that coach, Miss Hoytz.

896
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,979
Yeah yeah, you thought
it'd be hilarious

897
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,879
if she named her kid Ash, 'cause then
she'd have to go around saying

898
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,379
"My Ash Hoytz. "

899
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,079
Francine, hi. I was
in "The Phantom Tollbooth"

900
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,579
with you in the sixth grade.
I played the dodecahedron.

901
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,779
Hello?
Jody, hey, yeah.

902
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,079
It's your cousin Danny.

903
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,879
I was wondering what
you were doing tonight.

904
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,679
Oh, you are?
What's Aunt Joy doing?

905
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,879
Is she... oh, okay.

906
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,314
- Well, I've gotta...
- (kids cheering, yelling)

907
00:52:15,315 --> 00:52:17,780
- I've gotta go.
- (beeps)

908
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,881
(doorbell rings)

909
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:39,780
- Come on, Dad. Pick up. Come on.
- (doorbell rings)

910
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,281
(big band music playing)

911
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:47,180
# Some people say #

912
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:49,580
# You look lovely #

913
00:52:49,581 --> 00:52:54,480
- (doorbell rings)
- # Some say you need a chance in love #

914
00:52:54,481 --> 00:52:56,780
# I want to say to you... #

915
00:52:56,781 --> 00:53:00,265
Some of our chat sessions
were just...

916
00:53:00,266 --> 00:53:03,715
I feel like
we've had sex already.

917
00:53:03,716 --> 00:53:06,380
Yeah, well, pretty much.

918
00:53:06,381 --> 00:53:08,666
Just once I'd like to live out

919
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:10,916
the fantasies without a computer.

920
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:13,681
Like, personally,

921
00:53:13,682 --> 00:53:16,081
I've always wanted to lead
a guy into the forest

922
00:53:16,082 --> 00:53:20,181
after a light drizzle,
just rip off each other's clothes.

923
00:53:20,182 --> 00:53:23,681
You would be on top
and my bare body,

924
00:53:23,682 --> 00:53:27,016
rubbing up against
the moist, slippery soil.

925
00:53:27,017 --> 00:53:30,381
And there would be like
a layer of damp leaves.

926
00:53:30,382 --> 00:53:34,081
And as we hold each other tight,

927
00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:38,481
pumping away,
back and forth, back and forth,

928
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:41,516
the leaves would be sticking
all over my naked body.

929
00:53:41,517 --> 00:53:43,982
(phone buzzing)

930
00:53:46,483 --> 00:53:48,382
You have a phone call.

931
00:53:48,383 --> 00:53:51,783
- Your phone, it's vibrating.
- Oh oh oh.

932
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:55,817
I'm sorry, I really should take this.
It's my son here.

933
00:53:55,818 --> 00:53:57,982
(whispering) What's up?

934
00:53:57,983 --> 00:53:59,582
Dad, I've been calling you
for the last 15 minutes.

935
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:02,282
- I'm in the middle of dinner.
- No, I know.

936
00:54:02,283 --> 00:54:05,082
- This woman is fantastic.
- Dad, listen.

937
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:08,017
For once I feel like
I'm making a connection here.

938
00:54:08,018 --> 00:54:09,782
Dad, listen to me.

939
00:54:09,783 --> 00:54:11,382
- What?
- I'm a loser.

940
00:54:11,383 --> 00:54:13,882
You're not a loser.
What are you talking about?

941
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,482
Dad, just face it, all right?

942
00:54:15,483 --> 00:54:17,082
Why, 'cause you're
going with Camille?

943
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:20,217
I'm not going with Camille now.
Craig's going with Camille.

944
00:54:20,218 --> 00:54:22,082
The thing's in an hour.
I've got the chauffeur here.

945
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:24,717
I don't have a car. I'm not gonna
show up in a limo by myself.

946
00:54:24,718 --> 00:54:27,383
Will you...
calm down, will you?

947
00:54:27,384 --> 00:54:29,368
Why is she going with Craig?
Hasn't he had

948
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,310
that same girlfriend
since third grade?

949
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:33,183
No, she got
these bad sun blisters.

950
00:54:33,184 --> 00:54:36,383
- Sun blisters.
- Dad, my whole world's caving in

951
00:54:36,384 --> 00:54:38,983
and it's 'cause the entire senior class
has managed to get dates now.

952
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:41,383
And they all have rooms, too,
the whole class...

953
00:54:41,384 --> 00:54:43,218
Sherman, Buchwald.

954
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:45,484
Dad, Bart got a room.

955
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:50,684
Bart got a room?

956
00:54:52,784 --> 00:54:55,783
Let me see what
I can do. Hold on.

957
00:54:55,784 --> 00:54:58,883
God, I feel terrible,
but it's an emergency.

958
00:54:58,884 --> 00:55:01,118
No no, don't worry
if it's an emergency. God, of course.

959
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,383
It's my kid, but I really want
to make this up to you.

960
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:05,985
Could we get together again,
like, tomorrow?

961
00:55:09,985 --> 00:55:12,684
- Is he hurt?
- No. Actually, it's the senior prom.

962
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:14,419
I've got to help find him a date.

963
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,585
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

964
00:55:18,185 --> 00:55:19,919
It's just that
he's counting on me.

965
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,186
Well, could you
at least drive me home?

966
00:55:22,187 --> 00:55:24,419
Um, sorry, you're gonna
have to take a cab.

967
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,619
Excuse me.
Sorry sorry. Excuse me.

968
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,085
Excuse me. Excuse me.

969
00:55:37,385 --> 00:55:39,384
Kill him. I'm gonna kill him.

970
00:55:39,385 --> 00:55:41,284
I'm gonna kill him.

971
00:55:41,285 --> 00:55:44,885
You know? Because I've always
wanted to go with Betsy McMullen

972
00:55:44,886 --> 00:55:46,885
and that was...

973
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:50,286
see, that was the problem
from the start.

974
00:55:53,286 --> 00:55:55,385
Betsy.

975
00:55:55,386 --> 00:55:57,886
(car honks)

976
00:56:02,686 --> 00:56:05,486
(chatting)

977
00:56:10,286 --> 00:56:12,420
- (cell phone rings, beeps)
- Yeah, Dad?

978
00:56:12,421 --> 00:56:14,585
All right, break down
the necessities here:

979
00:56:14,586 --> 00:56:16,770
One, somewhere near
the Bonaventure, right?

980
00:56:16,771 --> 00:56:18,985
There's gotta be
lots of women around there.

981
00:56:18,986 --> 00:56:21,820
Two, they've got to be dressed nice.
That's gotta be important.

982
00:56:21,821 --> 00:56:24,038
Now look for women
who could be dressed for a prom,

983
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:26,687
which means what?
We need someone in formal wear.

984
00:56:32,487 --> 00:56:35,787
Coming through.
Coming through. Excuse me.

985
00:56:37,487 --> 00:56:39,887
(panting)

986
00:56:43,387 --> 00:56:45,887
(man speaking over P.A.)

987
00:56:56,387 --> 00:56:58,987
("Hava Nagila" playing)

988
00:57:08,988 --> 00:57:12,222
- (cell phone rings, beeps)
- Yeah, what have you got?

989
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:16,189
- Brown hair, brown eyes.
- Danny: How old?

990
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:20,122
I don't know.
12, could pass for 13, 14.

991
00:57:20,123 --> 00:57:22,522
No. No no.
Dad, that's too young.

992
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:24,488
All right, all right.

993
00:57:25,888 --> 00:57:28,222
I've got a five-footer,
big hair, lots of makeup.

994
00:57:28,223 --> 00:57:29,887
- How old?
- Maybe 35.

995
00:57:29,888 --> 00:57:32,722
- 35?
- All right. Calm down, calm down.

996
00:57:32,723 --> 00:57:35,222
Don't panic, just...

997
00:57:35,223 --> 00:57:38,288
Jesus.

998
00:57:57,689 --> 00:58:00,089
(sirens in distance)

999
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:30,789
Are you a cop, honey?

1000
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:34,274
Uh, no, I...
no, I'm here for my kid.

1001
00:58:34,275 --> 00:58:38,190
- How much you got?
- Oh, yeah, I...

1002
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,590
Okay.

1003
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:49,390
(tires screeching)

1004
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:56,189
So how old's your kid?

1005
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:59,989
He's 17... 18, he's 18.

1006
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:02,590
Just turned, actually.

1007
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:04,925
What, is it his birthday
or something?

1008
00:59:04,926 --> 00:59:07,790
Uh, no.

1009
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:09,790
(cell phone rings, beeps)

1010
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:11,725
Ernie: Okay, she's gonna
meet you at the front entrance.

1011
00:59:11,726 --> 00:59:14,490
Don't ask any questions.

1012
00:59:14,491 --> 00:59:16,525
(phone beeps)

1013
00:59:16,526 --> 00:59:18,991
(keys jangling)

1014
00:59:25,591 --> 00:59:28,291
(limo starts)

1015
00:59:40,391 --> 00:59:43,526
Um, how...
how do I know that you're not...

1016
00:59:43,527 --> 00:59:47,092
because, you know,
that could be awkward.

1017
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:50,291
What does that feel like?

1018
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:52,992
Okay, that's it.

1019
00:59:53,692 --> 00:59:55,991
(rock music playing)

1020
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,492
(kids chatting)

1021
01:00:33,093 --> 01:00:35,493
Stein?

1022
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,293
(kids chatting)

1023
01:00:50,093 --> 01:00:52,593
(camera clicking)

1024
01:01:21,394 --> 01:01:24,594
- Tickets, please.
- Yeah.

1025
01:01:25,294 --> 01:01:27,594
Oh.

1026
01:01:30,594 --> 01:01:33,594
That's all right.
I know you've got 'em.

1027
01:01:41,595 --> 01:01:45,429
Wait a second.
What is this?

1028
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:47,795
It's the, um...

1029
01:01:51,895 --> 01:01:54,295
it's the prom.

1030
01:01:56,495 --> 01:01:59,929
- I don't do proms.
- What do you mean you don't do proms?

1031
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:03,029
I just don't do proms, honey.

1032
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:05,395
Wha...

1033
01:02:06,795 --> 01:02:09,295
(blues music playing)

1034
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:23,595
Man:
Okay, big smile. Pose for a second.

1035
01:02:23,596 --> 01:02:25,830
At the count of three
look at right here, please.

1036
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:28,147
Ready?
One, two and three.

1037
01:02:28,148 --> 01:02:30,356
One more time.
Big smile.

1038
01:02:30,357 --> 01:02:32,495
Yeah, there you go. That's it.

1039
01:02:32,496 --> 01:02:35,630
Turn closer, a little more to me.
That's it. Big smile.

1040
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:38,296
Thank you. Next.

1041
01:02:38,896 --> 01:02:42,830
A big smile.
Thank you. Next.

1042
01:02:42,831 --> 01:02:45,296
(speaking softly)

1043
01:02:59,297 --> 01:03:01,131

1046
01:03:25,397 --> 01:03:27,497
Danny.

1047
01:03:28,297 --> 01:03:30,397
Bart.

1048
01:03:30,997 --> 01:03:32,696
Did you hear
what happened?

1049
01:03:32,697 --> 01:03:34,497
What?

1050
01:03:35,197 --> 01:03:37,598
They overbooked the hotel.

1051
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:42,332
I didn't get a room.

1052
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:44,097
No?

1053
01:03:44,098 --> 01:03:47,298
I got a suite.

1054
01:03:49,098 --> 01:03:51,898
("Hava Nagila" playing)

1055
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,599
(big band music playing)

1056
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:25,599
(people laughing, chatting)

1057
01:04:53,699 --> 01:04:56,900
- What happened?
- Doesn't do proms.

1058
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:04,199
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Yeah, all right.

1059
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,684
- What are you having?
- A vodka tonic.

1060
01:05:06,685 --> 01:05:09,600
- Do you want a vodka tonic?
- Yeah, sure.

1061
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,200
- Hey, how's it going?
- Fuck you.

1062
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
- Not a good sign.
- Yeah, not so good.

1063
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,699
Well, look at it this way...

1064
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:26,200
it can't get any worse.
(chuckles)

1065
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,699
Okay, well, actually...

1066
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,200
Mom.

1067
01:05:37,401 --> 01:05:39,700
- What's going on?
- What are you doing here?

1068
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:42,135
- What's he doing here?
- Hello, Beth.

1069
01:05:42,136 --> 01:05:43,900
Ernie.

1070
01:05:43,901 --> 01:05:46,600
I drove over 'cause you left
the tickets at the house.

1071
01:05:46,601 --> 01:05:49,200
- Yeah, I left them.
- I was worried you wouldn't get in.

1072
01:05:49,201 --> 01:05:52,100
- Thanks.
- I was... wait, where's Camille?

1073
01:05:52,101 --> 01:05:54,500
- Both: She went with Craig.
- With Craig?

1074
01:05:54,501 --> 01:05:56,500
Are you serious?
What happened to his girlfriend?

1075
01:05:56,501 --> 01:05:58,535
She had these
bad sun blisters.

1076
01:05:58,536 --> 01:06:00,600
Sun blisters, and so...

1077
01:06:00,601 --> 01:06:03,635
- Dad was helping me find a date.
- Just now?

1078
01:06:03,636 --> 01:06:06,700
- Yup.
- And you got dressed up to do that?

1079
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:08,700
No, I was on my own date.

1080
01:06:08,701 --> 01:06:10,400
He left her to help me.

1081
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:13,800
- And you helped him?
- Uh, yes.

1082
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:17,401
- We found a nice, lovely...
- Yeah, she was...

1083
01:06:17,402 --> 01:06:19,101
Where'd you find her?

1084
01:06:19,102 --> 01:06:22,101
- Oh, a couple... a couple...
- Yeah, she was...

1085
01:06:22,102 --> 01:06:26,002
- Well, where is she?
- Both: Doesn't do proms.

1086
01:06:27,702 --> 01:06:31,436
Well, then... well, then you're
not gonna go at all?

1087
01:06:31,437 --> 01:06:34,701
- No.
- Oh. Oh!

1088
01:06:34,702 --> 01:06:37,036
Oh, this was supposed
to be the highlight...

1089
01:06:37,037 --> 01:06:38,936
- this was gonna be...
- Whatever.

1090
01:06:38,937 --> 01:06:40,936
Hey, would you like a drink?

1091
01:06:40,937 --> 01:06:42,701
Yeah, all right.

1092
01:06:42,702 --> 01:06:45,201
Can I get a Harvey Wallbanger
for my ex-wife?

1093
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:47,701
- Right? Harvey Wallbanger?
- Right. Thank you.

1094
01:06:47,702 --> 01:06:50,101
Hey, doesn't Danny
look handsome?

1095
01:06:50,102 --> 01:06:52,801
Oh, are you kidding me?
He's adorable.

1096
01:06:52,802 --> 01:06:54,537
- You like the tux I got him?
- It's nice.

1097
01:06:54,538 --> 01:06:56,202
I see you got him
a tie too.

1098
01:06:56,203 --> 01:06:58,237
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want...

1099
01:06:58,238 --> 01:07:00,203
Thank you.

1100
01:07:00,903 --> 01:07:03,102
So did this guy
propose or what?

1101
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:06,902
- I think he was about to.
- Ernie: Who is he?

1102
01:07:06,903 --> 01:07:10,337
- How... how would you...
- No.

1103
01:07:10,338 --> 01:07:13,737
- He's a nice guy.
- Yes. Uh-huh.

1104
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:15,902
And you? How's...

1105
01:07:15,903 --> 01:07:19,037
- Met a woman tonight... interesting.
- I'm sorry to screw that up.

1106
01:07:19,038 --> 01:07:21,502
Hey, you couldn't have known
this was all gonna happen.

1107
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:23,937
- No, this was out of your control.
- This was not his fault.

1108
01:07:23,938 --> 01:07:26,102
He was a victim
of circumstances.

1109
01:07:26,103 --> 01:07:29,337
I think you should've been
more aggressive with that sophomore.

1110
01:07:29,338 --> 01:07:31,237
God, you're in control
of your own life.

1111
01:07:31,238 --> 01:07:33,102
You're gonna have
a great picture.

1112
01:07:33,103 --> 01:07:35,538
- Leave him alone. He's working on it.
- What is it that you want?

1113
01:07:35,539 --> 01:07:38,203
Every kid wishes their parents
would get back together,

1114
01:07:38,204 --> 01:07:40,138
but it's not realistic.

1115
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:42,003
"This moment forever. "

1116
01:07:42,004 --> 01:07:44,003
Ernie:
You didn't think she was cute?

1117
01:07:44,004 --> 01:07:47,138
Yeah, but she's ditzy
and Danny doesn't do well with ditzy.

1118
01:07:47,139 --> 01:07:50,003
Hold on.
Wait, I'll... I'll be...

1119
01:07:50,004 --> 01:07:52,904
don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

1120
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:58,004
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

1121
01:08:00,704 --> 01:08:02,804
Come on, come on.

1122
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:17,804
(techno music playing)

1123
01:08:17,805 --> 01:08:19,905
(kids yelling)

1124
01:08:56,206 --> 01:08:58,206
Hey.

1125
01:08:58,706 --> 01:09:01,306
How's your night?

1126
01:09:02,006 --> 01:09:04,240
You know,
it's actually a lot of fun

1127
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:06,505
spending a night
like this by yourself.

1128
01:09:06,506 --> 01:09:10,006
You don't have to
share it with anybody.

1129
01:09:11,706 --> 01:09:14,205
- (chokes up) Seriously.
- Craig: This is nothing to argue...

1130
01:09:14,206 --> 01:09:15,640
- we can hang out tomorrow.
- It's not too bad.

1131
01:09:15,641 --> 01:09:17,405
- Come on.
- This is... what? No no no no.

1132
01:09:17,406 --> 01:09:20,005
You need to go home
and get some sleep. I'm sorry.

1133
01:09:20,006 --> 01:09:22,005
Abby: What, so you can spend
your prom with her?

1134
01:09:22,006 --> 01:09:23,940
- Are you gonna forgive me?
- Craig: What was I supposed to do,

1135
01:09:23,941 --> 01:09:26,105
stay home?
I didn't get any sun blisters.

1136
01:09:26,106 --> 01:09:28,005
Abby: Did you ever
even consider my feelings about this?

1137
01:09:28,006 --> 01:09:30,506
(arguing continues)

1138
01:09:40,907 --> 01:09:44,441
Craig: I'm sorry.
I'm not going home with you right now.

1139
01:09:44,442 --> 01:09:47,406
- I've got to take this suit back...
- Okay.

1140
01:09:47,407 --> 01:09:50,106
...in the morning. Do you realize that?
I have to be up at 6:00 in the morning

1141
01:09:50,107 --> 01:09:52,807
and take this stupid thing...
what are you doing?

1142
01:09:56,207 --> 01:09:59,506
- I've got to show you something.
- Where are we going?

1143
01:09:59,507 --> 01:10:01,406
To the bar.
My parents are there.

1144
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:02,906
What are your parents
doing at the bar?

1145
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:07,006
- Moral support, I guess.
- Man: One more time.

1146
01:10:07,007 --> 01:10:08,907
Next.

1147
01:10:17,308 --> 01:10:19,808
(big band music playing)

1148
01:10:26,308 --> 01:10:28,242
...water in the sink. I can see it...

1149
01:10:28,243 --> 01:10:30,307
No. You see the... Camille.

1150
01:10:30,308 --> 01:10:31,907
- Hi.
- How's it going?

1151
01:10:31,908 --> 01:10:34,507
Good good. Just trying
to get through this alive, I guess.

1152
01:10:34,508 --> 01:10:36,942
I just wanted to let you guys know
I've got Camille with me now,

1153
01:10:36,943 --> 01:10:38,507
so we're gonna go
in there and have fun.

1154
01:10:38,508 --> 01:10:40,007
- That's... go. Go for it.
- Oh, that's great.

1155
01:10:40,008 --> 01:10:42,107
Are you guys gonna...
you know?

1156
01:10:42,108 --> 01:10:44,107
Oh, I'm probably
gonna take off.

1157
01:10:44,108 --> 01:10:45,907
I've got to get back to...
listen, it was so good to see you.

1158
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,607
It was good to see you
and I'll see you at graduation.

1159
01:10:48,608 --> 01:10:49,942
Graduation.
Yes, we'll see you then.

1160
01:10:49,943 --> 01:10:51,608
It might be kind of weird,

1161
01:10:51,609 --> 01:10:54,308
but do you guys want to come in?

1162
01:10:54,309 --> 01:10:56,608
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1163
01:10:56,609 --> 01:10:58,643
- I'm not going into the prom.
- Besides, the kids don't want

1164
01:10:58,644 --> 01:11:00,708
- to see the parents.
- No, honey, tonight is your night.

1165
01:11:00,709 --> 01:11:03,143
You need to go in there
and celebrate with everybody.

1166
01:11:03,144 --> 01:11:05,608
Yeah, you're right... I should,

1167
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:07,643
and I know exactly
where we're going.

1168
01:11:07,644 --> 01:11:10,310
Man:
Eins, zwei, drei.

1169
01:11:10,311 --> 01:11:13,409
(bar mitzvah music playing)

1170
01:11:16,809 --> 01:11:20,609
Oh, I don't think we're allowed
to be in here, Danny.

1171
01:11:26,009 --> 01:11:29,609
Danny: And so this is
how I spent my night.

1172
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:31,944
Nothing like
what I had hoped for,

1173
01:11:31,945 --> 01:11:34,209
but somehow better.

1174
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:37,310
Somehow just the way
it should've been.

1175
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:41,044
Did I look even remotely cool?

1176
01:11:41,045 --> 01:11:43,261
Probably not, but...

1177
01:11:43,262 --> 01:11:45,409
I spent my prom night

1178
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:48,110
with the three people
I love the most.

1179
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:51,194
And after we danced
the "Electric Slide,"

1180
01:11:51,195 --> 01:11:53,409
after the four of us
played a drunker game

1181
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:56,009
of Boggle
in my hotel room,

1182
01:11:56,010 --> 01:12:00,210
just before I fell asleep next to
my oldest friend on the single bed,

1183
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:04,410
I finally had
this moment of clarity.

1184
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:08,744
We can't choose our memories.

1185
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:11,510
The best ones just happen.

1186
01:12:11,511 --> 01:12:14,745
So what's the point of trying
to create the perfect moment

1187
01:12:14,746 --> 01:12:18,110
when the perfect moment

1188
01:12:18,111 --> 01:12:20,911
is right now?

1189
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,811
(big band music playing)
