1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,300
Wow... where are we?

2
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:22,501
In the future.

3
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:25,502
The final battle between the
Men and machines.

4
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:28,503
Oh, brilliant! Just a
Nice way to save me!

5
00:00:29,504 --> 00:00:30,504
Perhaps the only.

6
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:42,505
- Here comes the crazy fool...
- Hold fast.

7
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:53,706
Accelerates... is approaching!

8
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:57,207
Go, Go! It is approaching!

9
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:03,208
Ah!

10
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,409
Well, what the plan?

11
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,810
You have a plan, true?

12
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:38,111
Skynet.

13
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:41,112
What Skynet?

14
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:42,113
S.

15
00:01:42,114 --> 00:01:44,414
I ask because there
 We are directing?

16
00:01:44,615 --> 00:01:45,615
You do not want to know.

17
00:01:58,616 --> 00:01:59,916
Here is where it starts!
Go, go!

18
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:06,317
Approaches...

19
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:11,318
Go to the right! Right!

20
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:12,519
Oh, no! Go to the left!

21
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,319
Left, Left!

22
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,120
No... go right, I feel.

23
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:19,121
To the right, we go!

24
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:20,322
John, I beg you to stop
To help me.

25
00:02:31,323 --> 00:02:32,323
Behind us!

26
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,424
I noticed.

27
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:46,025
Ahhhhh!

28
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:55,626
Hey, you do not need to worry for me...

29
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:56,627
I am well.

30
00:02:57,828 --> 00:02:58,528
 Here...

31
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:19,829
For God was really close.

32
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,730
Bad sign.

33
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:22,731
That?

34
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:45,132
What was that?

35
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,333
There are others, walk!

36
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:40,334
Careful!

37
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:49,935
We go!

38
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:19,336
Finiscila make noise!

39
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:22,337
All well?

40
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:25,338
To the ground!

41
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,339
Hey! Head to watermelon!

42
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:17,940
Your friend?

43
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:19,841
It was my roommate at college.

44
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:22,842
Take its ammunition.

45
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:23,943
Ammunition?

 46
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:31,944
Excellent.

47
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,445
Not to do so.

48
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:48,446
Huge.

49
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:49,947
Well, we go inside Skynet.

50
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:52,348
I was afraid that I told...

51
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:58,549
- We must move.
- Andiamo.

52
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,250
Fast!
