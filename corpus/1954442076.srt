00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,600
The Legend of Lucy Keyes (2005)

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,797
<i>I yanked on the stem</i>
<i>as hard as I could and it broke,</i>

4
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,558
<i>so the magic pumpkin started</i>
<i>rolling down the hill.</i>

5
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,194
<i>Mom,</i>
<i>I am so sick of Lucy's stories.</i>

6
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,958
<i>Don't interrupt, Molly.</i>

7
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,275
<i>I chased it but I couldn't catch it</i>
<i>because it was rolling too fast.</i>

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,592
<i>I have to go to the bathroom.</i>

9
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,309
Are we far?

10
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,190
No. Just a little further
up the road.

11
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,632
The gas is cheaper here.

12
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,238
-Molly, where is your sister?
-Maybe she's in the bathroom.

13
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,068
By herself?
Molly, you know better than that.

14
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,229
Lucy!

15
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,270
Lucy!

16
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,034
And so the magic pumpkin

17
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,430
hit a rock and cracked open.

18
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,757
Inside there were
magic pumpkin seeds

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,390
that could bring
my baby sister back.

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,512
Well, little lady, how did you
conjure up a story like that?

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,477
You know,
nobody's around forever.

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,750
Lucy!

23
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,596
Lucy. There you are.

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,676
Bye.

25
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,071
Wow, mom, this is cool!

26
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,316
-Can I go check out the barn?
-Me too.

27
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,314
No, I don't want you in there
until dad makes sure it's okay.

28
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,193
No, no, it's allright. Yeah,
go ahead girls, just be careful.

29
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,868
Stay out of the hayloft.
It may not be safe.

30
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,234
-I can't believe we did this.
-We did it.

31
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,832
Boy, oh boy, did we do it.

32
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,790
This is going to be good for us.

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,435
It is.

34
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,552
We better unpack.
The truck will be here soon.

35
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,279
I love you, Jeanne Cooley.

36
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,878
They used to have horses.

37
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,519
Mom said they had lots
of animals on this farm.

38
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,273
I want a horse.

39
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,109
You wouldn't even know
how to take care of one.

40
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,389
Yes, I would.

41
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,757
Mom says we can't go up there.

42
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,916
I'm going anyway.

43
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,750
It's pretty dark up there.
And there's probably ghosts.

44
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,353
Molly, I'm telling.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,037
Okay, guys. There's one up front
and there's one in the back.

46
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,595
Can we decide which ones
we want without a battle?

47
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,233
I don't like this one.

48
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,514
That was easy.

49
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,839
-This one's okay.
-Luce, what do you think?

50
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,190
Yeah.

51
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,189
-Shit!
-Dad, you owe me a quarter.

52
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,196
Sorry.

53
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,274
Alright.
I'm going to fix that for you later.

54
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,716
Alright. We got that sorted out.

55
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,272
You know what? I'll take that one.

56
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,872
Hello? Hello?

57
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,628
Hi. I'm Sheila Travers.
This is my husband Bud.

58
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,877
-We live just across the road.
-Hi, I'm Jeanne Cooley. How are you?

59
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,036
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

60
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,551
Guy! He's my husband.

61
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,875
Guy!

62
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,392
This is our neighbors,
Sheila and Bud.

63
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,080
-Hi, Guy Cooley. How are you doing?
-Hi.

64
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,271
-Bud Travers.
-Nice to meet you. How are ya?

65
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,435
Great. Great.

66
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,995
Do you guys want to come inside?
We're still unpacking, it's a mess.

67
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,953
No, we just wanted to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

68
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,152
-And I made a casserole.
-Oh, thank you. That's so nice.

69
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,714
It's good to see some life around
this old farm. You city folks?

70
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,040
Oh, I hope it's not that obvious.

71
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,997
Guy got offered a job around here,

72
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,918
so we decided
to give country living a try.

73
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,111
Of course,
the windmill project, right?

74
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,117
-Yeah, that's right.
-How's that coming?

75
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,550
Great. We've got a great location
back on the mountain.

76
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,558
Hey, I want you to say hi
to Mr. and Mrs. Travers.

77
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,476
Hello.

78
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,557
-You have children?
-Yeah, this is Molly

79
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,239
and Lucy's over there.

80
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,596
-You have a daughter named Lucy?
-Yeah.

81
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,270
-Do you have any children?
-No. No kids, no.

82
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,471
God hasn't graced us with any.

83
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,755
I'm sorry.
You sure you won't come in?

84
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,758
No, no. That's okay.
We just came by to say hello.

85
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,676
Hello.

86
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,157
Well thank you so much for
the casserole. That's very nice.

87
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,954
-It's nice meeting you, folks.
-Yeah, nice meeting you too.

88
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,639
-Welcome to town.
-Great, thank you.

89
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,193
-Take care.
-Yeah.

90
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,039
-Bye.
-Bye.

91
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,033
-What is it?
-You'll like this, come here.

92
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,595
I have an 18th century farm house,
what else could I want?

93
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,155
Well, now you have
an 18th century dinner bell.

94
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,795
Go ahead, try it.

95
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,397
Molly! Lucy! Dinner!

96
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,517
Lucy! Molly! Dinner!

97
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,551
Molly! Lucy! Dinner!

98
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,718
I love you. I have to go.

99
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,069
Oh, where?

100
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,111
I have a meeting.
With Samantha Porter.

101
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,915
I thought we were going
to have dinner all together.

102
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,714
-The first night?
-I have to go up to the windmill.

103
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,273
Will you keep some warm for me?

104
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,435
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

105
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,635
Hurry.

106
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,517
There it is...
the site of your future.

107
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,354
It's perfect.

108
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,113
How're you settling in?

109
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,518
Oh, it's an adjustment,
but we'll be fine.

110
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,040
-We love the house though.
-It's a classic.

111
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,708
-One of the first in town.
-So I understand.

112
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,071
Well look at that, a 15 mile an hour
reading. That's fantastic.

113
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,674
It's been a dream of this town
for a long time

114
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,829
to use this land
for something important.

115
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,357
Town meeting tomorrow.
What can we expect?

116
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,235
It's hard to muster up an argument
against green power these days.

117
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,951
I don't anticipate any problems.

118
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,559
These small towns, people can be
stubborn. They don't like change.

119
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,994
They're ready for change.
Trust me.

120
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,233
<i>No. I can't talk right now.</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

121
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,633
What are you doing?

122
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,468
Come to bed.

123
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,913
You can't hear that?

124
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,875
No.

125
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,595
I can't.

126
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,711
What I would give
for some freeway noise.

127
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,034
It's just going to take
a little while to get used to.

128
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,635
<i>And it's actually almost</i>
<i>more of an obligation</i>

129
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,397
to embrace a more progressive

130
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,830
forward-thinking energy alternative
like this one.

131
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,873
Wind power has been the way
of the past and ironically

132
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,275
will probably be the way
of the future, so...

133
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,839
And this is a revolutionary
new technology

134
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,793
that does a great job of harnessing
what is the oldest

135
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,753
and most renewable energy
resource available.

136
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,075
The wind.

137
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,397
Does anyone have any questions?

138
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,436
How many of these windmills
are we talking about here?

139
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,195
Typically we like
to build one windmill

140
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,358
or one turbine for every
eight to ten acres of land.

141
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,710
So I think we're talking
about eight windmills.

142
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,552
-Ms. Sawyer?
-Yes,

143
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,070
I'm all for green energy,

144
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,834
but I'm not sure I want

145
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,235
to look at eight big ugly towers.

146
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,871
I think what you need to ask yourself
is what is more important,

147
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,395
embracing a more environmentally
friendly technology

148
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,989
or sticking with the status quo.

149
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,355
Ms. Caswell.

150
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,711
Has anyone thought about
what disturbing this site

151
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,229
will do to this sensitive
historic place?

152
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,034
I'm sorry, I'm not quite sure
what you are referring to.

153
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,196
Many consider
that to be Martha's land.

154
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,550
I was under the impression
this was town owned land.

155
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,113
It is town owned Guy.

156
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,595
You know my concerns. Have you
expressed them to Mr. Cooley?

157
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,756
Gretchen, please,
we've spoken of this.

158
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,076
Don't waste any more
of Mr. Cooley's time.

159
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,510
I'm sure every effort
is going to be taken to insure

160
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,712
the historical sanctity
of this land, so...

161
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,480
-Consider yourselves warned.
-Gretchen, that's enough!

162
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,918
This is our land
and this is the eighty acres

163
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,678
that the town bought
for the windmills.

164
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,877
I wonder if it used
to be one big farm?

165
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,274
Oh, in fact it was.

166
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,354
It belonged
to the Eli Farnum family.

167
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,152
They owned the farm next to yours.

168
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,351
Samantha, this is my wife, Jeanne.
Jeanne, Samantha.

169
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,755
Samantha Porter,
welcome to town.

170
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,515
-That went very well.
-Yeah, yeah, it did.

171
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,991
That woman,
she talked about

172
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,270
the historical
significance of the land?

173
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,197
-It's just a silly old town legend.
-It's nothing we need to worry about.

174
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,359
Not in the least.
Gretchen Caswell is local color.

175
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,028
There's always someone who will
object no matter how good an idea

176
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,356
-you put on the table. Right?
-Absolutely.

177
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,630
-Nice to see you.
-Nice to see you.

178
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,228
-Hi.
-Good morning.

179
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,510
-Breakfast tea to go.
-Sure.

180
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,993
$1.59 please.

181
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,950
Thank you.

182
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,915
Thank you.

183
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,877
You just moved into the old farm
on Westminster Road, didn't you?

184
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,594
Yes, we did.
How do you do? Jeanne Cooley.

185
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,633
Gretchen Caswell. Do you have time
to join me or are you in a hurry?

186
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,915
Yeah... No.

187
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,028
So, you talked about...

188
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,479
At the town meeting you talked
about historic place and Martha?

189
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,519
Are you a church going woman?

190
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,955
No, I'm not, I'm afraid I'm not.
Not anymore.

191
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,872
Do you believe in the afterlife?

192
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,511
I don't know, I guess.

193
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,709
Tell me, dear,
what is your greatest fear?

194
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,989
Losing a child?

195
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,835
What are you saying?

196
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,639
Your little girl?

197
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,348
You'd never get over that.

198
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,431
-I better go.
-Please,

199
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,756
you misunderstand me.
Sit down, please.

200
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,353
Just one second.

201
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,595
Hold on.

202
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,553
Is this ever going to work?

203
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,909
Just a minute.

204
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,238
So Gretchen Caswell
is not just local color.

205
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,749
What do you mean?

206
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,155
I think she threatened me
and the kids.

207
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,479
What are you talking about?

208
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,836
I don't know.
Did we do something to offend her?

209
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,519
Why? What did she say?

210
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,588
She was asking all these questions
about me

211
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,155
and the kids and fears and...
I don't know.

212
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,799
She was asking questions?

213
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,153
Do you want me to call the police?

214
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,159
I don't know.

215
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,879
Maybe I imagined it.

216
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,599
I'll talk to her about it.

217
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,551
<i>- Voilá.</i>
-Oh, you're a genius.

218
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,955
See ya.

219
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,673
Hey! Hey, slow down.

220
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,598
Gotta find the stone marker.

221
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,635
Dad, I found it.

222
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,112
Let's see...

223
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,555
This is it.

224
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,993
Daddy, what are you doing?

225
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,679
I'm marking the boundaries
of our territory, honey.

226
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,633
The animals mark the boundaries
of their territory with their scent.

227
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,478
That's gross.

228
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,755
Come in.

229
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,348
-See that way up there?
-Yeah.

230
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,596
That's where daddy's going
to build his windmills.

231
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,916
-Cool.
-Yeah, it is cool.

232
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,069
Come on, let's go.

233
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,674
Lucy, come on!

234
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,230
-What's that?
-Nothing.

235
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,194
What are you doing?

236
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,398
Molly, Lucy, c'mon down.

237
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,670
Coming.

238
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,599
-Did Lucy see it too?
-No, I don't think so.

239
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,792
-Why? Did she say anything to you?
-What was it doing there anyway?

240
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,468
-What are we having?
-Pork chops.

241
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,356
What have you been doing
all alone up there, sweetheart?

242
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,471
-Playing with my friend.
-What friend?

243
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,436
-This isn't Pork Chops.
-No it isn't, Daddy's a funny guy.

244
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,719
-Shut-up, Lucy.
-We do not say shut-up in this house.

245
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,989
Lucy!

246
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,149
Mom, did you know that animals
mark their territory with their pee?

247
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,430
They do? Who told you that?

248
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,269
-It's natural.
-No, it's not.

249
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,519
Your father is crazy.

250
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,678
Yes, completely crazy.
And Lucy is too.

251
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,955
-Molly!
-Hey, knock it off with the French.

252
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,434
It's fun!

253
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,634
I don't understand any one of you.
Stop speaking French!

254
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,394
-I'll not listen to you anymore.
-How's the food?

255
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,509
Molly!

256
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,436
Hello?

257
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,229
Who's there?

258
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,349
Hello?

259
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,909
She's back.

260
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,354
Don't you hear her?
She's out there.

261
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,755
Wake up! Wake up!

262
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,916
I've heard something.

263
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,873
-What did you hear?
-A voice. Something in the woods.

264
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,631
-What voice?
-I don't know. I went to check.

265
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,149
The door was slamming
in the barn

266
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,749
and it was like...
like a woman's voice.

267
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,036
I think it was Gretchen Caswell.

268
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,356
What?

269
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,753
It's so late, honey.
Go back to bed.

270
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,318
-She scared the shit out of me.
-I'm sure she did.

271
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,549
Oh, God!

272
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,555
Oh, my God!

273
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,592
Nice to see some new faces.

274
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,434
-I'm Gretchen Caswell.
-I'm Guy Cooley.

275
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,113
I hope I didn't upset your wife
at the coffee shop the other day.

276
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,629
Well, you did as a matter of fact.

277
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,270
I'm sorry,
but I was trying to make a point.

278
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,310
Samantha Porter doesn't take
this situation seriously,

279
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,195
but she should and so should you.
This land should be left alone.

280
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,757
What a beautiful child!

281
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,113
-Lucy...
-Thank you.

282
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,515
Come on, Molly.

283
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,235
Lucy!

284
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,675
Come on!

285
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,275
-How's it going?
-Fine.

286
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,194
Mommy!

287
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,679
What stinks?

288
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,518
I'm not really sure, honey.

289
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,995
Bet it's Lucy.

290
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,679
Hey, knock it off.

291
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,154
Mommy, we saw a funny lady
at church today.

292
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,555
-Really?
-She had white hair.

293
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,432
-Was it Caswell?
-Yes.

294
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,076
She's harmless.
She just against the project.

295
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,558
Wanna come to church next time?

296
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,670
You haven't been
since Anna's funeral.

297
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,788
No, I'm not really ready... yet.

298
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,675
It's just a community thing.
It would look better if you came.

299
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,549
Don't push me, Guy.

300
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,269
I'm going to get out of these
clothes. You want to help me?

301
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,909
Of course not.

302
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,950
Hello?

303
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,955
Hello?

304
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,916
Hello?

305
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,111
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?

306
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,274
I'm Guy Cooley,
I'm your new neighbor.

307
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,959
Yeah, I know who you are.

308
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,915
Oh, well...

309
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,669
I'm trying to figure out
what that smell is.

310
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,949
Clam bellies.

311
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,915
Clam bellies?

312
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,839
I was wondering if you might maybe
move it inside... inside your barn.

313
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,793
Maybe put some lids on it
so it's not so strong.

314
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,555
I'm just trying to be civil here.

315
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,512
The stuff smells like shit.
I'm trying to be neighborly.

316
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,474
Well, maybe I don't feel
like being neighborly.

317
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,628
Now from where I see it
you're trespassing.

318
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,080
Well, alright.
Jesus Fucking Christ!

319
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,869
<i>Lucy.</i>

320
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,237
I heard you call me, mommy.

321
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,829
I must have called you
in my sleep.

322
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,071
Let's go back to bed. Come on.

323
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,358
Dad, let's go. We don't want
to be late for the bus.

324
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,912
Have you heard the stories of all the
wives that went on back in the 70's?

325
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,792
-You're kidding me!
-No.

326
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,315
This was a very colorful town.

327
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,713
-Evidently.
-Key parties and everything.

328
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,071
-Anyone you know?
-I could tell you stories, yeah.

329
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,313
I remember my grandmother
talking about this mural.

330
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,154
-She was furious when it was covered.
-This one?

331
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,356
Yeah.

332
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,396
She used to live in this house.
My maiden name is Keyes.

333
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,832
My family's lived on this land
for over 250 years.

334
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,554
Who are the Farnums?

335
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,594
Next door. Dodd's a Farnum.

336
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,389
They've been there for generations.
Just like our family.

337
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,430
Really?

338
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,957
No wife swapping between the Keyes
and the Farnums, I'll tell you that.

339
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,709
Have you ever heard

340
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,675
of anything in the woods?

341
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,475
What do you mean?

342
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,151
I don't know. Like voices?

343
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,599
Voices in the woods?

344
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,630
I thought I heard
something last night.

345
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,358
It must have been the wind.

346
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,593
There was a lot of wind
last night.

347
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,510
Hi.

348
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,716
Hey.

349
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,480
Why am I hearing a lot more
opposition to these windmills

350
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,908
than you initially lead me
to believe there'd be?

351
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,871
At the end of the day, Guy, people
know it's the right thing to do.

352
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,315
You know, I don't mean
to sound paranoid, but

353
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,511
this town doesn't seem
too excited about the project.

354
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,033
This is just the process, Guy.

355
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,196
-Process?
-Leave the PR to me.

356
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,309
Do you know that someone left
a pig head on my property?

357
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,512
Gretchen has been wandering around
in my woods scaring my wife.

358
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,395
Everybody who knows Caswell
thinks she's certifiable.

359
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,595
Once the town votes in favor
of the project, which it will,

360
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,429
things will settle down.

361
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,593
You know, my family
has to live in this town too.

362
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,029
Of course you do.

363
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,549
So do I.

364
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,873
Come on.

365
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,629
Dodd just had a whole bunch
of clam bellies delivered.

366
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,956
He's feeding them to everything
that walks. It smells awful.

367
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,229
How unpleasant.

368
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,557
-I'll get into this Guy.
-Yeah.

369
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,116
I've spoken to him about it, but
it's like talking to a brick wall.

370
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,159
Let me make a few calls.

371
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,074
I'd appreciate it.

372
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,272
-Good to see you.
-Good seeing you.

373
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,510
Jonas!

374
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,999
Good morning, Samantha.

375
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,636
-What do you want?
-What is that smell?

376
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,115
Clam bellies.

377
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,069
-Why clam bellies?
-They're cheap.

378
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,832
Well they smell awful.

379
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,514
Doesn't bother me.

380
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,789
Well, it bothers your neighbor.
A lot.

381
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,314
They're very effective.

382
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,595
Oh, Jonas!

383
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,072
This doesn't have anything
to do with your ghosts, does it?

384
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,679
It does, doesn't it?

385
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,715
What if it does?

386
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,956
Are you trying
to look like a fool?

387
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,599
You don't understand.

388
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,393
I need Cooley.

389
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,913
I gotta feed my pigs.

390
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,351
Jonas,
get rid of the clam bellies.

391
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,959
I gotta feed my pigs.

392
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,238
-May I help you?
-Yes.

393
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,030
I'm interested in learning
about our farm on Westminster Road

394
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,709
and the Keyes family
who owned it many years ago.

395
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,071
There's a history that was published
at about the turn of the century

396
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,589
that goes into great detail
about Lucy.

397
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,076
Lucy?

398
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,553
Lucy Keyes and her disappearance,
of course.

399
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,189
What are you doing?

400
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,109
Listening to the wind,
the wind in the trees.

401
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,198
-It's peaceful.
-Yeah.

402
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,149
250 years ago a little girl,
Lucy Keyes

403
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,757
went blueberry picking
with her sister.

404
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,110
I'll race you to the stone wall,
Lucy.

405
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,674
<i>They wandered into</i>
<i>these very woods.</i>

406
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,236
<i>A little while later,</i>
<i>Lucy's sister returned without her.</i>

407
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,032
Where's your sister?
Where's Lucy?

408
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,357
I don't know. We were racing back.
I thought she returned ahead of me.

409
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,676
Well, she didn't.
She's supposed to be with you.

410
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,075
You're supposed to look after her.
You're the older one.

411
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,635
You were supposed
to be responsible for her.

412
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,915
Lucy!

413
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,234
Lucy!

414
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,828
Lucy!

415
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,154
Lucy!

416
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,309
Lucy!

417
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,668
<i>And Lucy was never seen</i>
<i>or heard from again.</i>

418
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,633
So what happened to Lucy?

419
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,913
People say she was abducted
by Indians,

420
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,633
but it was never proven.

421
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,319
It's always the Indians.

422
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,639
<i>Well, there was never</i>
<i>a better explanation,</i>

423
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,798
<i>so that's what people believed.</i>

424
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,310
<i>They say Martha Keyes</i>
<i>actually stalked</i>

425
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,318
<i>and killed Indians</i>
<i>she found roaming on their land</i>

426
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,954
<i>to get revenge</i>
<i>for Lucy's disappearance.</i>

427
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,193
<i>Even now, when the wind blows</i>
<i>on the mountain,</i>

428
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,270
<i>some people say they can hear</i>
<i>Martha calling for her lost child.</i>

429
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,518
It's just the wind, I'm sure.

430
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,555
I don't know,
some people have heard her.

431
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,870
Lucy...

432
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,152
Lucy says she's heard her.

433
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,831
Or it could just be Gretchen Caswell
creeping around in the woods.

434
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,509
I don't know.

435
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,399
I've never seen
so many trees in my entire life.

436
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,069
What are we doing here?

437
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,119
When are you going to clean up
the goddamn stench?!

438
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,556
Dodd!

439
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,995
<i>People from all the neighboring</i>
<i>towns gathered</i>

440
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,556
<i>and traversed the woods</i>
<i>day after day, week after week,</i>

441
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,352
<i>searching for Lucy.</i>

442
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,389
Lucy!

443
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,392
<i>But no sign of her was found.</i>

444
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,233
<i>Martha continued searching</i>
<i>for the rest of her life</i>

445
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,795
<i>and was brought</i>
<i>to the edge of insanity</i>

446
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,513
<i>over the loss of her little girl.</i>

447
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,358
Lucy!

448
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,879
<i>Night and day she would comb</i>
<i>the mountain side calling for Lucy.</i>

449
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:01,119
<i>The echo from the edge of</i>
<i>the forests was the only reply.</i>

450
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,998
<i>Legend has it that her soul</i>
<i>will not rest</i>

451
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,236
<i>until she finds her lost child.</i>

452
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,349
Who's my little girl?

453
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,516
-I am.
-Yes, you are.

454
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,229
-Sweet dreams only. Okay?
-I'll try.

455
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,475
Alright, good.

456
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,349
Daddy!

457
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,668
Where's Mommy?

458
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,513
She's coming back later.

459
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,593
Where'd you get this?

460
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,275
Nowhere.

461
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,110
You miss your little sister,
don't you?

462
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,438
You can't go into that box anymore
because this doesn't belong to you.

463
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,516
I know.

464
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,477
And we can't tell mommy
about this either. Okay?

465
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,436
Okay.

466
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,868
-This'll be our little secret.
-Okay.

467
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,195
Alright, good.

468
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,435
-I love you.
-I love you too, daddy.

469
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,077
-Good night, daddy.
-Good night. Sleep tight.

470
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:03,996
Okay.

471
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,078
Where have you been?

472
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,636
I'm on a deadline and I can't really
afford to be baby-sitting all night.

473
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,679
I've been at the library.

474
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,714
Missing girl again?

475
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,315
How are the girls?

476
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,709
They're sleeping.

477
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,155
Did you talk to the neighbor
about the smell?

478
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,915
Yes, I did.
Total asshole.

479
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,275
Clam bellies.

480
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,955
Clam bellies?

481
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,909
He feeds them to his pigs.

482
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,155
I spoke to Samantha
about Dodd and the smell.

483
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,952
She's going to make some calls.

484
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,709
Robert Keyes fought
with his neighbor too.

485
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,108
Over pig feed?

486
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,639
Over property lines.

487
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,555
<i>Lucy!</i>

488
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,319
<i>Lucy!</i>

489
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,874
<i>Oh, my God! Anna!</i>

490
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,634
<i>Help me!</i>

491
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,195
What is it?

492
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,995
I had a dream.

493
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,675
What are you doing?

494
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,474
-I am going to check on the girls.
-Honey, they're fine.

495
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,349
I want to.

496
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,035
<i>Lucy!</i>

497
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,716
I'm starved. When's dinner?

498
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,752
It's almost ready.
Where is your sister?

499
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,474
Outside in the barn.
I couldn't stand the smell.

500
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,389
Lucy, dinner!

501
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,395
Lucy!

502
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,877
No. No!

503
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,069
Lucy!

504
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,515
Oh, God!
Lucy, what happened?

505
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,160
?My arm hurts!

506
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,830
Let mommy see.

507
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,389
I told you
the hay loft wasn't safe.

508
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,474
My doll!

509
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,549
Are you okay?

510
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,479
Hey, you're doing great.
Look at you.

511
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,115
God! Look at that!

512
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,676
You're going to go
for a ride to the hospital.

513
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,632
-Daddy!
-I love you.

514
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,876
I'm going to see you
in one second.

515
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,514
I'm going to see you in one second,
honey. One second.

516
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,748
Come on, let's go.

517
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,397
Your project may not pass.

518
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,719
It has to pass.

519
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,799
Fine, from what I'm hearing,
it's not going to be a sure thing.

520
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,436
Why don't you let me worry
about this? Go and talk to Dodd.

521
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,230
Why?

522
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,516
He's giving Cooley some trouble
with his pig feed or something.

523
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,393
-Why don't you talk to him?
-You're the law, Bill,

524
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,953
he'll listen to you.

525
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,349
Fine. Fine.

526
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,395
Mom, it stinks!

527
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,388
-Yeah, can't you fix that?
-Daddy's working on it, supposedly.

528
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,596
Guy, what is this all about?

529
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,436
What?

530
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,359
This is a purchase and sale agreement
between Samantha Porter

531
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,710
and the town
for the windmill property.

532
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,508
Wait, so Samantha owns the land?
I don't understand.

533
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,554
-Did she sell the land to the town?
-For 1.8 million dollars.

534
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,591
Who is this woman
you're working with?

535
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,719
What is she up to?

536
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,519
Where did you get that?

537
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,757
The deal's contingent on the windmill
project being approved.

538
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,951
And guess who shares
in the profits?

539
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,639
-Who?
-Dodd!

540
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,350
Dodd?

541
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,548
-Let me see that.
-I gave up everything for this?

542
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,515
Jeanne!

543
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,190
Jeanne!

544
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,792
I guess the smell hasn't gotten
any better from next door.

545
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,195
No, it hasn't.

546
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,870
How is your daughter?
I heard she took quite a spill.

547
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,757
Yeah, she broke her wrist.
She's fine.

548
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,029
My!

549
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,712
This mural looks original.

550
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,835
Have a seat.

551
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,029
Thank you.

552
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,876
My husband is going to pay Jonas
a visit tomorrow.

553
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,398
With the health inspector.

554
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,353
Why haven't you ever mentioned

555
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,233
that the land being purchased
by the town belongs to you?

556
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,795
This project is too important,
Guy.

557
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,237
I didn't want you to think there was
some conflict of interest.

558
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,395
There is!

559
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,754
This is no secret to anyone in town.
It never has been.

560
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,793
The guy who's been making our lives
miserable is your business partner!

561
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,396
Jonas is not my business partner.

562
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,113
Jonas is my cousin.

563
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,799
Our family owned the land.

564
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,111
Jonas is mentally disabled

565
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,276
and I'm the only one left
to look after him.

566
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,798
I have been doing everything
I possibly can for you, Guy.

567
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,189
Have you?

568
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,671
Because this isn't the way
I wanted to do things.

569
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,155
I'm so close to walking
on this project.

570
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,113
When we finally have the support
to move this project forward?

571
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,552
I am thinking of the big picture.

572
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,320
Changing the way people
think about energy.

573
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,237
It might be a small step,
but it's a valuable step.

574
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,429
And you know it is.

575
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,797
Don't disappoint me, Guy.

576
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,949
Come here, dear.

577
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,149
Robert Keyes had a hand
in building this church,

578
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,472
dates back to the early 1760s.

579
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,234
Everything changed
when you moved to town.

580
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,596
Why did you send me
that agreement?

581
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,800
I wanted you to know
who you are dealing with.

582
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,157
Desecrating those woods,

583
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,591
destroys every hope of Martha
ever finding her daughter.

584
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,592
Surely you understand
the pain of that loss.

585
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,676
Yeah.

586
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,395
-What happened to Lucy?
-No one knows.

587
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,279
What do you think happened to her?

588
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,154
I wouldn't let any kid
go into those woods.

589
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,876
No one ever found
Lucy Keyes again.

590
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,390
No.

591
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,991
When the hell
did I get so popular?

592
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,313
Hello to you too, Jonas.

593
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,916
This is Bob Greenwood
from the board of health.

594
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,793
Good afternoon, Mr. Dodd.

595
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,717
We've received complaints about
the smell coming from your property.

596
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,355
It's a farm!

597
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,878
Goddamn city folks, isn't it?

598
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,038
I'm allowed to feed my pigs.

599
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,508
Absolutely. I don't want
to prevent you from doing that.

600
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,917
We are just here to formally request
that you clean up the clam bellies

601
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,714
and reduce the smell
to the surrounding area.

602
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,118
Otherwise, I'll have to hit you
with a cease and desist,

603
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,390
and a violation.
And I don't want to have to do that.

604
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,195
Okay?

605
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,511
-Alright then.
-Fine.

606
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,875
Thank you.

607
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,675
Bill,

608
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,235
got a second?

609
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,152
Yeah. Give me a minute.

610
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,192
She sent you, didn't she?

611
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,794
What does that matter?

612
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,549
Why are you feeding clam bellies
to your pigs?

613
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,352
-I need them.
-Why?

614
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,879
Keeps away the spooks.

615
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,512
You're serious, aren't you?

616
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,156
They don't like
the smell of death.

617
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,795
Okay, Jonas.

618
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,791
You are a crazy bastard.

619
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,558
But you gotta clean that up.

620
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,434
Like hell I will.

621
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,790
<i>Lucy!</i>

622
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,830
The Secretary
of Environmental Affairs

623
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,554
looked at a whole slew of reports
from the Audubon Society

624
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,830
and a bunch of other environmental
groups and they determined

625
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,669
that there is really no need for
an Environmental Impact Report.

626
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:19,836
Why?

627
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,234
Probably because of the positive,
proactive nature of the project.

628
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,473
Can we reconsider

629
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,229
this windmill proposal in light
of the recent ghost sightings?

630
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,159
The board has intention of stalling
this based on what a small...

631
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,272
I know I am not the only person
in this room who has heard her.

632
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,069
Alright! Alright!

633
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,913
Now, unless there
is any further rational discussion,

634
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,033
I'll entertain a motion
to vote.

635
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,195
So moved.

636
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,512
-Second?
-Second.

637
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,029
Alright.

638
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,269
On the question of
whether the town approves

639
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,119
the construction of a wind farm
on the South West slope

640
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,799
of Wachusett Mountain.

641
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,989
All those in favor?

642
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,156
I.

643
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,634
-All those opposed?
-They.

644
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,111
The results are too close
to count with a verbal vote,

645
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,278
so we will move to a counting
of hands. All those in favor?

646
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,759
Keep your hands up.

647
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,356
Okay.

648
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,829
All those opposed.

649
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,869
Thank you.

650
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,359
The question passes

651
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,469
with 41 for,

652
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,513
37 opposed.

653
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,954
Thank you very much.

654
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,676
Congratulations.

655
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,838
I told you it would pass.

656
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,468
Yeah, barely.

657
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,999
Like you said, change is hard,
but in the end they come around.

658
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,596
And it made you
a very wealthy woman.

659
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,917
-How's the smell from next door?
-Great. Thanks.

660
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,475
It was the least I could do.

661
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,835
What's up?

662
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,594
It smells so good.

663
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,037
This is the way
it's supposed to smell.

664
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,229
It's nice.

665
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,869
Yes, it is.

666
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,353
I'm sorry about the other day,
I didn't mean to snap at you.

667
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,955
-Where are the kids?
-Watching TV.

668
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,189
What are you doing?

669
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,158
I love you so much.

670
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,235
Me too.

671
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,715
-Lucy, honey, what is it?
-I can't sleep.

672
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,070
Why?

673
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,078
I keep thinking about
the lady in the woods.

674
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,753
There's no lady in the woods.

675
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,919
She just wants her Lucy back,
right?

676
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,079
Of course she does, sweetheart.

677
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,595
Mommies always want
their children back.

678
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,352
C'mon, let's go back to bed.

679
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,877
<i>Lucy!</i>

680
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,752
It's you! It's because of you.

681
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,598
It's because of you.

682
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,758
It's because of you she's here.

683
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,790
Guy!

684
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,037
Now just go.
Go before someone gets hurt.

685
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,358
-Get out!
-It's because of you.

686
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,518
Don't come any closer.

687
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,350
Go!

688
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:30,995
You go!

689
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,909
Go!

690
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,796
<i>This time he's gone too far.</i>

691
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,514
<i>I mean, how can you go threatening</i>
<i>your neighbors with a shot gun?</i>

692
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,439
I know, I know, don't worry,
I'll take care of everything.

693
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,150
Hello?

694
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,830
Jonas, where are you?
Stay right there.

695
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,153
Jonas, what's going on?

696
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,516
They got to go.
They got to go!

697
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,915
Jonas, how can you ruin
everything right now?

698
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:09,995
<i>Jonas!</i>

699
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,789
<i>Jonas!</i>

700
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,436
Jonas!

701
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,392
Bill, wait!
I want to go with you.

702
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:20,996
<i>Lucy!</i>

703
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,196
Samantha!

704
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,155
Samantha!

705
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,470
<i>Lucy!</i>

706
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:37,876
Lucy!

707
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:42,118
-Mommy! Mommy!
-Go away!

708
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,918
Open the door! Jeanne!

709
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,471
-What's going on in there?
-Daddy!

710
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,191
-What's going on?
-Go back to your room.

711
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,834
Lucy!

712
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:55,830
Lucy!

713
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,475
Go away!

714
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:02,996
Lucy!

715
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,149
Lucy, she's gone.

716
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,158
Jeanne! Lucy!
Are you okay?

717
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,793
-It's okay.
-Jeanne.

718
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,954
Are you awake?

719
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,512
How do you expect me to sleep?

720
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,552
That door would not open.

721
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,399
Do you believe me now?

722
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,869
It doesn't...

723
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,719
It doesn't make sense.

724
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,759
I know is what I saw.

725
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,310
Hi.

726
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,075
-Molly, you're home?
-Yup. Soccer got canceled.

727
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,556
-Where's your sister?
-I dunno.

728
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,436
Lucy!

729
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,231
Your mommy's looking for you.

730
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:46,909
I know.

731
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,274
-You found my doll.
-No, she's my doll.

732
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,038
I found her in the barn.

733
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,471
-I have a trade for you.
-No, I don't want to trade her.

734
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,915
-But this is a secret.
-A secret?

735
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,030
Lucy!

736
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,595
Lucy!

737
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,636
Lucy!

738
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,075
Shut up!

739
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,629
Shut up!

740
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,430
Lucy!

741
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,154
Where are the papers?

742
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,029
I know I put them right there.

743
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,350
-Lucy, where were you?
-Nowhere.

744
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,354
Don't lie to me!

745
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,638
You were at Dodd's house,
weren't you?

746
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,637
I don't ever want you to go there.
Do you understand me!?

747
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,436
Never!

748
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,513
Now go to your room!

749
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,791
<i>To the family of Robert Keyes.</i>

750
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,080
<i>I, Eli Farnum, am an old man.</i>

751
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,799
<i>I cannot die</i>
<i>till I tell the true story</i>

752
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,228
<i>of Lucy Keyes</i>

753
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,553
<i>and the sin I committed</i>
<i>against Robert and Martha</i>

754
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,239
<i>after their passing.</i>

755
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,708
<i>Keyes and I</i>

756
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,869
<i>quarreled about the line fence</i>
<i>between our farms,</i>

757
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,671
<i>and the referees decided</i>
<i>against me.</i>

758
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,194
<i>One day,</i>
<i>I was crossing the path</i>

759
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,713
<i>near Keyes' field,</i>

760
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,873
<i>when I saw the child,</i>

761
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,989
<i>Lucy.</i>

762
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,995
<i>She saw me</i>
<i>and appeared frightened,</i>

763
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,238
<i>as if I were a wild beast.</i>

764
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,158
<i>She began to run away.</i>

765
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,152
<i>My anger was aroused and</i>

766
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,639
<i>I gave chase.</i>

767
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,551
<i>I did not mean to kill her,</i>

768
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,630
<i>but mad with hate and fear,</i>

769
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,356
<i>I struck her three heavy blows</i>

770
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,357
<i>on the head with a stone.</i>

771
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,755
Oh, my God!

772
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,795
<i>I hid the body in a hollow log.</i>

773
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,470
Jonas!

774
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,356
Jonas?

775
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,310
Where are the documents, Jonas?

776
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,309
They took them.

777
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,194
You took them.

778
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,991
I know you were in my house.

779
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,036
Where did you put
the deed and the letter?

780
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,390
-It doesn't matter.
-Of course it matters.

781
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,079
You don't want to lose this house,
do you?

782
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,196
No!

783
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,794
Come on out, Jonas.

784
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,549
Give me the hammer.

785
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,795
The hammer.

786
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,035
It's alright.

787
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:35,636
Be ready.

788
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,154
Come on.

789
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,035
That's it.

790
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,915
It's alright.

791
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,675
<i>Lucy!</i>

792
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,675
<i>Quiet! Quiet!</i>

793
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,510
<i>Quiet!</i>

794
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:18,995
Lucy!

795
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,433
-It's okay.
-No, it's our Lucy! It's our Lucy!

796
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,435
802
02:14:22:11
02:14:23:15

797
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,076
Lucy!

798
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,195
Mommy!

799
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,712
-Lucy's gone.
-I know, sweetheart.

800
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,389
Lucy!

801
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,919
Lucy, come on out, honey.

802
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,189
Lucy!

803
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,668
Sweetheart,
if you're hiding, come out.

804
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,109
Lucy!

805
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,315
Lucy!

806
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,589
Hey, Cooley,
what the hell is going on here?

807
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,638
Is this some kind of joke? You got
my wife scared out of her gourd.

808
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,395
No, it's not a goddamn joke.
We can't find Lucy, she's missing.

809
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,669
-Did you find her?
-No.

810
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,074
-She's not in the house?
-No.

811
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,838
-I'll call the police.
-I already did.

812
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,712
I have another flashlight
in the barn, can you help me?

813
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,512
-Sure.
-I'll stay here for the police.

814
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:53,755
I'll wait with you.

815
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,673
Sweetie.
Why don't you go in the house.

816
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,871
It's freezing out here.
Just go inside.

817
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,633
So you've heard her too,
haven't you?

818
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:04,995
Yeah, I've heard her.

819
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,395
-Why didn't you say anything?
-I've heard it in for years.

820
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,397
I didn't want anyone
to think I was crazy.

821
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,795
You're not crazy, Sheila.
I've heard her, you've heard her.

822
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,433
Dodd has heard her. Okay?

823
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,269
Dodd.

824
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,108
Lucy was at his house today.

825
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,954
She was there.

826
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,675
-I'll stay with Molly.
-Thanks.

827
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,436
Jonas!

828
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,750
Jonas!

829
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:15,835
Chief Kemper!

830
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,112
-She's gone to Dodd's.
-Alright.

831
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,752
You check out this barn.
I'll look in the house.

832
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,075
You got it chief.

833
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,789
He killed...

834
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,551
He killed my baby!

835
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,632
Come with me. Come with me.

836
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,839
Come on. I'll take you home.

837
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:00,949
Lucy!

838
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,069
844
02:18:24:01
02:18:25:06

839
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,675
Jesus!

840
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,158
Oh my God! Holy shit!

841
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,115
Lucy!

842
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,515
Lucy!

843
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,315
Lucy!

844
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,435
Lucy!

845
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:06,790
Lucy!

846
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,275
Lucy!

847
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,790
Lucy!

848
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,395
Lucy!

849
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:28,679
<i>After the search parties were gone</i>
<i>I retrieved her body</i>

850
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,518
<i>and hid it for good</i>

851
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,118
<i>in a makeshift crypt,</i>

852
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:36,437
<i>in the abandoned barn</i>
<i>on the Keyes property.</i>

853
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,718
<i>Setting fire to the barn,</i>

854
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,595
<i>I was certain</i>

855
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,431
<i>no one would ever find her.</i>

856
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,155
<i>My ugly hate persisted</i>

857
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:53,313
<i>and I found a way to take back</i>
<i>what was rightfully mine.</i>

858
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,591
<i>After Martha and Robert's passing</i>
<i>I was</i>

859
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,953
<i>able to switch</i>
<i>the deeds to our lands</i>

860
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,516
<i>with those of my own creation.</i>

861
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:12,835
Sheila!

862
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:15,870
Okay.

863
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,836
There's a barn... somewhere,
I can't...

864
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:23,630
It burned down years ago. There's
a foundation behind Dodd's property.

865
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:27,073
OK, that's where Lucy is.
Call Kemper. Okay?

866
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,036
Guy! I know where she is.

867
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,272
It's all about the land deal.

868
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,390
-I found her basket.
-Lucy went to find Lucy Keyes.

869
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,874
Come on. This way.

870
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,751
The site of the old barn
should be this way.

871
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:44,599
Farnum killed Lucy Keyes
over a land dispute. Listen.

872
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:49,915
<i>Lucy!</i>

873
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:53,676

01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:58,756
<i>Lucy!</i>

875
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,950
Samantha and Dodd knew
the land wasn't theirs to sell.

876
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,071
And we can't let it happen again.

877
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,276
Wait!

878
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,475
Did you hear that?

879
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,433
-Lucy!
-Lucy!

880
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,472
No, no, quiet. Quiet!

881
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,079
Be quiet!

882
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:06,511
<i>Quiet!</i>

883
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:11,836
Oh my God!

884
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,354
Lucy!

885
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,669
Lucy!

886
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:31,955
Lucy!

887
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:09,396
<i>Lucy!</i>

888
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,236
Lucy!

889
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,595
Lucy!

890
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:22,436
Lucy!

891
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,155
Lucy!

892
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:35,836
Lucy!

893
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,234
Lucy!

894
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,875
Over here.

895
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,315
Lucy!

896
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,876
Wait!

897
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,310
The crypt. The crypt!
Where is it?

898
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,515
-Lucy!
-Lucy!

899
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,352
-Lucy!
-Lucy!

900
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:03,631
Lucy!

901
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:07,670
Lucy!

902
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,715
Come on!

903
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,954
Mommy.

904
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,792
Here. Here.

905
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:31,159
Go, go, go! Call someone.

906
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,073
Look at me, Lucy.

907
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,875
Lucy, open your eyes, baby.

908
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,588
Mommy.

909
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,429
<i># Can you hear her calling out?</i>

910
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,711
<i># Can you wipe away her tears?</i>

911
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:38,159
<i># Lay comfort to her screams</i>

912
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,789
<i># that the banshees carry on?</i>

913
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:48,239
<i># Yeah.</i>

914
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:00,909
<i># There's a sadness in her eyes</i>

915
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,629
<i># as she dances all alone.</i>

916
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:12,555
<i># The shadow of her face</i>

917
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,597
<i># shows the anguish in her soul.</i>

918
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,519
<i># Calling out her name</i>

919
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,188
<i># every night.</i>

920
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:26,234
<i># Whispered by the wind</i>

921
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:29,193
<i># through the trees.</i>

922
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,994
<i># Echos of her cries</i>

923
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,555
<i># never cease</i>

924
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,070
<i># till she looks in the eyes</i>

925
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:41,590
<i># of her lost child.</i>

926
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:45,759
<i># Yeah.</i>
