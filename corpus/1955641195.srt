00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:18,628
<i>My Papa was the hardest
working person I ever met,</i>

2
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:22,159
<i>spending almost every day
of the year on the road.</i>

3
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:32,028
<i>But, whenever he had time off,</i>

4
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:34,027
<i>he would race home to see us...</i>

5
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,678
Maximo! Sara!
Your father is here.

6
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:43,364
<i>Even if he had
to drive all night.</i>

7
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,274
Move!

8
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,123
I'm okay...

9
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,963
<i>My Papa always said,
"You get what you work for,</i>

10
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:13,530
<i>"not what you wish for."</i>

11
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:16,632
<i>So much for hard work.</i>

12
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,769
This is a nightmare.

13
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,152
I know it's horrible living here,
but we're still a family.

14
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,191
I don't need a family.

15
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,991
What I need is somewhere to live
that isn't an old wreck.

16
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,700
When I'm older, I'm
going to be an architect.

17
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:42,372
So I can build a
big house for us.

18
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:48,000
What are you going to do?
- I'm going to sleep  so I can be sleeping.

19
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,996
What are you going
to do for work?

20
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm going to be rich
so I don't have to work.

21
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,219
But Papa always said
that you get what you

22
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,982
work for,
not what you wish for.

23
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,280
And look what
happened to him!

24
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:08,155
It's time to sleep, children.
- We're already asleep.

25
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,188
Look...

26
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,693
This is who I'm going to be.

27
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:20,776
He didn't get that rich
without having a job.

28
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:22,061
No, no, no, no.

29
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,673
I don't want his job.
I want hers.

30
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,643
Maximo.

00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:45,028
Hi Maximo.

33
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,014
You'll like that, Maximo.

34
00:03:58,177 --> 00:03:59,998
Thank you.
- Thank you!

35
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,326
Talk to me, Rafa.
What's on the menu?

36
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,710
Take a look at lounge
chair number three.

37
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,827
There's a hot one over
there, super rich!

38
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,432
I see her, I see her.

39
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,528
She looks delicious.

40
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,218
Who is she?
- Peggy von Strauss.

41
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,773
Fifty-five, divorced...

42
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,847
But she's loaded.
- Yeah?

43
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,903
Her family owns the biggest
supermarket chain in the United States.

44
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,107
She's perfect.

45
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:02,171
Oh! I think I'm
making you wet.

HOW TO BE A
LATIN LOVER

48
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:10,746
You know, no I can't. I have my
helicopter lesson this weekend.

49
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:38,963
Spot!

50
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:45,179
Spill.

51
00:07:00,557 --> 00:07:02,364
Shadow!

52
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,286
Finished.

53
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:26,221
Maximo!

54
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:30,522
There you are, my raindrop.

55
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:33,456
I was just, just on my way
to wake you

56
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,223
Do you know what day today is?

57
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:40,145
Tuesday.
- No! It's Saturday.

58
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,777
Close enough.
- Happy anniversary!

59
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,458
Oh! Yeah.

60
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:50,253
Just what I needed.
- Really?

61
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:52,756
So different.

62
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,003
This one says 9:20,
this one doesn't.

63
00:07:57,972 --> 00:08:01,060
I love it. Thank you, thank you.
I love it.

64
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:10,198
I got you something too.
- Really?

65
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:12,648
Where is it?

66
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:16,314
We have...

67
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:21,048
to go... pick it up.

68
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:23,416
How exciting!
- I know!

69
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:25,315
I'll be right back.
- Right.

70
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:30,447
Just one second. - I'm waiting
for you. I'm ready for you.

71
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:33,739
I'll be but a second,
sweetie.

72
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:43,248
One second.
- I'm here.

73
00:08:57,821 --> 00:08:59,447
Happy anniversary!

74
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:04,841
Darling, what a sweet
thought. - Get in. Get in!

75
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:07,459
I would, but with my knees,

76
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,853
I'm afraid it's too close
to the ground for me.

77
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:15,144
Okay, forget it.

78
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:17,613
We won't get it then.

79
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:22,135
I don't want my knees to
ruin our special day.

80
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,590
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.

81
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:29,460
Let's get in.
It could be your car too.

82
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,287
Yeah, I suppose
that could work.

83
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,480
We'll take this one.
- It's a fine choice.

84
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:41,549
You know the McLarens
are like snowflakes,

85
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,240
and no two of
them are the same.

86
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:46,632
Is that true?
- Actually it doesn't, but...

87
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,118
I still think it's a lovely image
with the snowflake. Don't you think?

88
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:54,080
Are you the charmer?
- Call it the romantic in me.

89
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:57,510
The guys in the floor calls me the poet,
these boneheads. They like to make fun.

90
00:09:57,992 --> 00:10:00,040
And what form of payment will
you be using today, sir?

91
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:02,402
Her.

92
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:05,405
Very good. I'll see if that's
an option in our system.

93
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:13,169
Are you se...
Another new car!

94
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,907
Yep. - How do
you do, Mr. Maxwell?

95
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:19,804
Once you lower your expectations,
Timmy, the sky is the limit.

96
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:25,684
That's the most beautiful thing
I've heard in my entire life.

97
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:29,895
Four! - You don't mind if Max
and I play  a few holes, do you?

98
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,644
Not at all. As long as you
play a few holes with me later.

99
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,549
You are a naughty girl.
- Here we are.

100
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:38,381
A steak and a salad.

101
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:41,332
Aha, mama likes
you slim and trim.

102
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:55,456
You want me to feed you
some meat. - I want it so bad.

103
00:10:57,653 --> 00:11:00,474
This first bite is all fat.
- Hey buddy.  - Oye, brother.

104
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:04,246
Millicent. You look
radiant as always.

105
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:08,867
Have I ever told you that you
remind me of Senor Rojas?

106
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:12,870
He was my Spanish professor
in college,

107
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:16,914
with whom I had a
passionate affair...

108
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:21,505
Yes, I think you mentioned
it once or twice...

109
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,333
Or every time I see you.

110
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:32,446
Let's hit the links.
- Yes!

111
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:37,744
Wanna grab a drink tonight?
- Nope, sorry. No offense,  got me booked up.

112
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:41,082
Got a bleaching appointment.
- You should try it some time.

113
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,878
I brush my teeth.
- I'm not talking about the teeth.

114
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:48,377
Ouch!
- Gotta keep it white and tight.

115
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:52,879
Guys like you and me,
we hide in the tall grass,

116
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:56,578
wait for the most beautiful gazelle
to come up from the back of the pack,

117
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:59,714
drops her head to get that last
drink of water and then we strike.

118
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,684
Thrill of the hunt.
- Wait.

119
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:04,646
Aren't the sickly ones
usually at the back of the pack?

120
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:06,498
What do you know about animals?
What are you, Steve Irwin?

121
00:12:06,762 --> 00:12:08,203
Rest in peace.
- I watch a lot of animal shows.

122
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:10,691
You're missing my point.
- You know what, Rick,

123
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:14,548
I don't have to worry about
hunting old gazelles anymore

124
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:16,611
because in my marriage,

125
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:20,003
I call the shots.

126
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:25,824
Would have been a lot cooler
if I sank that.

127
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,024
I loved that you got
yourself a matching McLaren.

128
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,514
We only played nine holes because
I wanted to get back home to you.

129
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:51,791
Maximo, you're home early.
- I missed you. What's wrong?

130
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:55,432
Did you get winded trying to
scrap cook again?

131
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:58,546
It was a nice refreshing beverage
after the workout we did...

132
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:01,649
Hey! You're back!
Hey, how you liking the car?

133
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,795
Handles like a beauty,
doesn't she?

134
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:08,545
You cheated on me with
a car salesman? - No, a little.

135
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:10,243
Remy. Here you go.

136
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:12,479
The number on the bottom
doesn't work anymore

137
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:13,853
but the top one is good.
Call any time, okay?

138
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:16,112
You want a drink?
The bar here's incredible.

139
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:17,325
Well, I don't have to tell you.

140
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:21,693
I'm sorry, Maximo.
It's over.

141
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:24,237
You sneeze, you lose, ese.

142
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:30,013
Okay. But, half of
everything is mine. - Actually, no.

143
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:35,479
You signed a prenuptial agreement.
- No, no, no. I signed a prenup.

144
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:39,609
No. Shit!

145
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,509
I can't believe this.
After I gave her my best years,

146
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,591
and after I gave her my youth,

147
00:13:45,637 --> 00:13:47,977
after I gave her the best of me.

148
00:13:48,014 --> 00:13:50,184
Of course, now that
my boobs have sagged,

149
00:13:50,225 --> 00:13:52,942
she finds someone
younger than me. Shit!

150
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,601
I'm leaving. I'm leaving!

151
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:59,065
Look, once I cross this threshold, I'm
never coming back! I won't come back! Ok.

152
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:04,407
I won't come back!
It's finished!

153
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:07,403
It's finished forever!
But she's going to miss me.

154
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,318
She'll miss my seeds.

155
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:12,377
Come harvest time,
she'll miss my seeds.

156
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,712
I'm feeling like playing some
cops and robbers tonight.

157
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,044
Spice things up

158
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,410
I think I might need to get frisked.
- That polyester  looks a little itchy.

159
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,478
It will suit you just fine.

160
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:28,011
No, no, no, you're gonna put
it on, you're gonna love it.

161
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:31,185
Whatever you want, mommy gets.
- That's right.

162
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:40,910
Maximo.

163
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,010
Rick.

164
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:47,676
I'm sorry... - My God!
- I'm sorry, you scared me.

165
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:51,978
Sorry, you okay? - Yeah.
- What's going on?

166
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,710
Peggy dumped me.

167
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:58,344
What the hell am I gonna do?

168
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:02,310
I have no money, no home,

169
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:04,772
no helicopters.
- Oh!

170
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:08,030
My God! Stop hitting me!
- I'm sorry.

171
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,110
I'm on these horse
testosterone pills,

172
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:13,342
that Millicent makes me take and
it gets me a little agitated.

173
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:18,622
Guys like you and me,
we're survivors.

174
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:21,744
We do whatever it takes
to come out on top.

175
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,876
Yeah, yeah. - Look at me. We're
survivors. That's what we do.  - Yes.

176
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:27,505
All you need to do is
find yourself a new wife.

177
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:30,096
Yes. New and improved.
- And improved!

178
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:32,375
Someone who's richer
and older than Peggy.

179
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:35,409
Absolutely, yeah. There's
plenty of fish in the sea.

180
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,416
All I need is a place to stay
while I am fishing.

181
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:41,845
Well, I know you haven't been
in touch for a while

182
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:43,576
but you could always try
stay at your sister's.

183
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:47,923
I'm not sure.
I mean, what about here?

184
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:51,811
No. - Why? - Millicent insisted
every room  be reserved at all times

185
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:54,085
in case she wants
to have a session.

186
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:56,653
There is not a room
that we don't...

187
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,063
There is one place.
- Great!

188
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:02,871
I'm so... It's the
pills, it's the pills!

189
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:04,311
I don't know how these
horses do it.

190
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:10,164
This is Millicent's
grand daughter's play house.

191
00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:18,410
Millicent's grand daughter has excellent taste.
- Millicent's grand daughter has expensive taste.

192
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:20,509
This cost a fortune.

193
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:23,580
Horrible little girl. One
time she made me salt a slug,

194
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,300
just so she could remember
how to laugh.

195
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:27,853
Anyway, sleep tight.

196
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:29,968
Thank you.

197
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:49,454
POOPING IS
FOR EVERYONE

198
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:52,709
So true.

199
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:57,841
So...

200
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,774
how do you guys know each other?

201
00:17:06,814 --> 00:17:09,335
Oh! Oh, my god! Oh!

202
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:11,776
Thanks for letting me stay
at your house.

203
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,280
I am sorry.
I thought it was a real toilet.

204
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:35,043
Hey! Hey! Hey!

205
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:42,178
Hey! Hey! Leave it alone!
That's mine!

206
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:43,818
Leave me alone!

207
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:48,157
NICK & SCOTT'S
WRAPSTARS

208
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:14,474
Hello?

209
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:18,474
Surprise! It's your brother!

210
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:20,568
No sir, you've got
the wrong apartment.

211
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:22,840
Hej! S... Sara.

212
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:30,612
Yes?
- Sara?

213
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:33,484
Who's this?

214
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,550
It's me, your brother.

215
00:18:38,147 --> 00:18:40,753
Maximo?
- Yeah. The one and only.

216
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:44,035
Open the door, will you?

217
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,507
Sara?

218
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:52,873
Sara?

219
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:04,092
Is this for real? You show
up today,  as if it were nothing?

220
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:08,476
After you didn't even bother
coming to see our dying mother,

221
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,475
When that avocado
tree fell on her.

222
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,898
You didn't come to see
my child when he was born.

223
00:19:13,937 --> 00:19:16,316
What made you think

224
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,569
I'd have any desire to see you?

225
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:23,990
You can't just show up like this.
I'm not opening the door for you! I'm not...

226
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:36,700
Hey, Sara! Sarita!
- I can't believe this.

227
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,307
Me neither! You're happy
to see me, right?  - No.

228
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:44,792
What are you doing here?
- Nothing! I wanted to  see you and my niece.

229
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,339
Nephew!
- That! Niece, no? Nephew?

230
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:51,722
Niece? What did I say?
Nephew? Nephew.

231
00:19:51,763 --> 00:19:54,972
That's it. Nephew.
- Tell me what you want,  and then beat it!

232
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:58,219
Peggy kicked me out.

233
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:01,348
She took everything.
Everything!

234
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:05,154
But, wasn't everything
hers to begin with? - Ok, fine.

235
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:07,282
She kept everything.

236
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:10,069
She even kept the
car I picked out for her

237
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:11,533
to buy for me,

238
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:14,370
to give her, for our anniversary.

239
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:16,739
I'm sorry to hear that.

240
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,061
I know you're angry
with me, but...

241
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:24,513
Can I stay with you? - Here?
Here in my house? - Yes.

242
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:29,550
I have nowhere else to stay.
- Really? You have  honestly lost your mind!

243
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:32,047
You've lost your head.
- You're my sister!

244
00:20:32,092 --> 00:20:35,051
Oh, I'm your sister now, right?
- You've always been my sister!

245
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:37,184
Oh, come on, Maximo!

246
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:40,271
I can't believe what
comes out of your mouth!

247
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,024
Don't be like this.
- Stop it!

248
00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:49,031
One day, and no more?
Come on.  - Really?

249
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:52,489
Grab your things!
What, do you think,

250
00:20:52,524 --> 00:20:54,338
that I'll carry them?
This isn't a hotel!

251
00:20:57,782 --> 00:20:59,951
Hey, your apartment is nice.
- Thanks.

252
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:03,035
Like, outside it seemed
a little... But it's cool.

253
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:07,741
Oh, my goodness!
It's Hector!

254
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:10,660
Hugo!
- Right. What did I say?

255
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,907
Hugo, remember I told you I
had an ugly crazy brother

256
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:16,673
who was the champion of farting?
- Yes.  - That's it.

257
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:19,571
Hey how are you?
- Meet Maximo. - Hi.

258
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,675
Look at you! You must be
six years old by now, a?

259
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:26,305
I just turned... ten.

260
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:28,039
Ten?

261
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:33,039
I know. I was kidding.

262
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:38,371
Everyone's so serious around here.
It's like, who died? - My dad.

263
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:42,776
I was sorry to hear about that.

264
00:21:45,977 --> 00:21:48,072
Pictures! Hey,
where's my picture?

265
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:50,505
I don't know.
Those are family photos.

266
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:53,905
I'm family. - Uncle Maximo...
We're having chicken rice.

267
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:55,538
Want some?

268
00:21:56,578 --> 00:21:57,638
Chicken?

269
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:03,371
No. Maybe I'll have a lobster roll.
- Or maybe you don't eat?

270
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,438
Why don't you say grace
before we start eating?

271
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:17,004
I'm really sorry. Next time.

272
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:20,120
This time...
- Okay, okay.

273
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,601
Dear Lord, even though we are
eating just chicken and rice,

274
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:31,386
at least we're
all here together.

275
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,593
Well, not all of us because...
Hector's dad is dead.

276
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:38,526
Hugo! His name
is Hugo. - Oh, yeah.

277
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:42,436
Because Hugo is dead. - Hugo
is not dead. His fa... - Amen.

278
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:46,738
Wait, wait, wait...

279
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:51,338
Lord, before you go, please

280
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:55,378
help me find a new wife
with a big heart,

281
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:58,252
but not necessarily
a strong heart,

282
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:02,337
with a high net worth,
and nice big house,

283
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:05,139
who doesn't ask me to poke
her that often.

284
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:08,339
Amen.

285
00:23:08,377 --> 00:23:10,598
Amen.
- Amen.

286
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:13,960
Hey, you got a girl friend?
- No.

287
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:18,082
Really? What's wrong with you?
- He's ten, Maximo.

288
00:23:18,117 --> 00:23:20,852
Oh! Late bloomer, a?

289
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:22,763
Hugo, I have an idea.

290
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:26,068
Why don't you tell uncle Max
about your science fair project?

291
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,707
And this way, it will be
you talking

292
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:31,573
and not this dummy over here.
- Okay. Sure.

293
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:34,671
I'm sending a weather
balloon with a Go Pro camera

294
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:37,907
to the edge of the stratosphere.
- Ou, stratosphere, wow!

295
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:40,660
I've modified the Go Pro camera
to send live video stream

296
00:23:40,843 --> 00:23:43,940
back to earth via FM transmitter.
- Wow, transmitter, wow!

297
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:46,375
The balloon's gonna go very high up.

298
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:50,736
And then we're gonna see like a little
part of the earth. - Earth. Wow! - Yeah!

299
00:23:50,877 --> 00:23:53,200
Now I understand why he
doesn't have a girlfriend.

300
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,803
Stop it!

301
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:07,963
Wanna know what I'm
doing, uncle Maximo? - No.

302
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:15,902
Oops! - You know,
I prefer my own room.

303
00:24:15,943 --> 00:24:18,094
And I prefer for you
to be normal.

304
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:22,583
But, we get what we get.
- I'm serious. What about upstairs?

305
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:27,166
Those are other
people's apartments. - Really?

306
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:28,671
Really.

307
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,441
But, hey, why don't you go knock
on their doors.

308
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:33,555
Maybe they'll take you in.

309
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:37,397
I love you!
- I love you mom.  - Sweet dreams!

310
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:42,728
What? I guess I'll
just tuck myself in.

311
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:52,568
How do you do this?

312
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,668
My God.

313
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:13,417
Uncle Maximo...
- Mm-hm?

314
00:25:14,374 --> 00:25:16,036
How long were you married?

315
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:19,486
Twenty five years.
Good night.

316
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:23,878
And you didn't have to work
that whole time?

317
00:25:24,676 --> 00:25:27,309
Nope. Nightie night.

318
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:30,175
What did you do for money?

319
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,486
I didn't need money.

320
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:35,467
She paid for everything.

321
00:25:36,842 --> 00:25:38,903
You go to sleep.

322
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:42,735
So now you have to find a
new wife to pay for stuff?

323
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:47,481
Yep. That's the plan.
Sweet dreams.

324
00:25:48,641 --> 00:25:50,659
How are you going to do that?

325
00:25:52,707 --> 00:25:54,866
By getting a good nights sleep.

326
00:25:55,876 --> 00:25:59,659
Why haven't you ever visited us?
- I've been busy.  - Doing what?

327
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:02,636
You just said you didn't work.
- Sara!

328
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:05,869
Sara Help! Sara!
Emergency, Sara!

329
00:26:05,908 --> 00:26:08,616
Emergency, Sara!
- What?

330
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:11,712
Aaaaaaaa!!!!

331
00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:15,038
I'm trying to sleep and the kid
won't stop talking!

332
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,878
You were talking too!
- To tell you to stop talking!

333
00:26:17,913 --> 00:26:21,569
Still talking! - Did I tell you to
stop talking? - No, no!  - Enough!

334
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:26,600
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Mira! I thought we were being robbed.

335
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:29,142
I was being robbed of
my beauty sleep.

336
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:31,930
Oh, God! Sh!

337
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:34,800
Go to sleep. Both of you!
- Yes, mommy.

338
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:37,382
And no more talking
about not talking.

339
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:40,741
And no more talking
about poking either.

340
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:47,055
Tattletale.
- Poke you!

341
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:22,669
Did you put your homework
in your back pack? - Yes.  - Good.

342
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:26,901
Morning.
- Morning...

343
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:29,574
Morning.
- Morning.

344
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:33,869
We have rules here. Any dish
that you use, you have to wash.

345
00:27:50,974 --> 00:27:53,471
I didn't know we can do that.
- We can't.

346
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:57,270
So don't even think about it.

347
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:04,465
Oh, James!
- Hi. - Hi!

348
00:28:04,505 --> 00:28:08,433
Sorry to interrupt you, you
have a guest... - I don't have a guest.

349
00:28:10,005 --> 00:28:12,834
Oh that? That's
my brother, Maximo.

350
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:15,931
Oh! Oh! Nice to meet you.

351
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:17,900
Pleasure is all mine.

352
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:23,628
Agh, you know what? My door knob
is sticking again. Can you believe it?

353
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:26,038
Again?
- I know. It's crazy, right?

354
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:30,240
Can I borrow your tools or?
- No, don't worry about it.

355
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,567
I'll take care of it.
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

356
00:28:33,638 --> 00:28:37,252
Easy. Easy peasy. I'd love to.

357
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:41,567
Got a sticky knob...

358
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:45,345
Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet
you there like in five minutes?

359
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,289
Okay. You're the best.
Thank you.

360
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:49,530
It's nothing.

361
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:53,387
Are you a carpenter or what?

362
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,139
When you're both the man
and the woman of the house,

363
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:59,076
you have to be a handyman
and do whatever is necessary.

364
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,902
Are you two...

365
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,065
What you doing?

366
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,461
What are you implying?

367
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:13,408
No!

368
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:17,697
I just help out when
something gets jammed in his house,

369
00:29:17,698 --> 00:29:19,312
or there's a
problem in his house.

370
00:29:19,938 --> 00:29:21,850
It's an old building.

371
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,475
Go get dressed. Look at you. We
have to leave in five minutes.

372
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,410
Hugo, get your stuff.
I'll meet you in the car.

373
00:29:29,438 --> 00:29:30,766
Sticky knob.

374
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:38,836
Look, that sad man has to spin the
sign like a fool for all to see.

375
00:29:38,938 --> 00:29:40,285
At least he has a job.

376
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:43,020
It's more than I can say
about another man in this car.

377
00:29:43,905 --> 00:29:45,991
Work's for suckers.

378
00:29:46,006 --> 00:29:49,678
Mom, uncle Maximo said the
S word. - That's not the S word.

379
00:29:49,713 --> 00:29:51,886
What is? - Can
I tell him?  - No!

380
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:53,703
Shit.

381
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,486
So, you're big time architect now.
- Junior architect. But, I still

382
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:02,456
haven't got my own
house to design.

383
00:30:02,472 --> 00:30:04,394
So I am not going
to be late for work

384
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,147
because you take two hours
to blow dry your hair.

385
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:10,318
I am trusting you with my car...

386
00:30:11,873 --> 00:30:15,651
I am trusting you with my car and
I am trusting you with my son.

387
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,085
You need to go out there and
find yourself a job.

388
00:30:18,504 --> 00:30:19,975
Pick me up at 5:00, okay?

389
00:30:20,504 --> 00:30:22,030
Okay, I'll try to remember.

390
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:25,936
You will remember, because I have
no other way to get back home.

391
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:28,642
I said I'll try. Jeez.
- 5:00!

392
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:32,455
Is she always like this?
- No, I just think she doesn't like you.

393
00:30:36,373 --> 00:30:39,265
Wow! I smell money.

394
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:42,227
How do you go here?
- I'm in academic scholarship,

395
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:45,236
that covers some of my tuition.
My mom has to pay the rest.

396
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:49,093
You can drop me off here.
- Drop you off? Are you kidding?

397
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:52,711
I'll walk you in. Where do
the rich single mom's park?

398
00:30:57,139 --> 00:30:59,368
Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

399
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,100
Friend of yours?
- Arden? No.

400
00:31:08,138 --> 00:31:11,883
I wish.
She doesn't even know I exist.

401
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:15,999
Why do you say that?
- Because, she's a girl, and she's cute

402
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:18,658
and I am me.

403
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,333
You make a great point,
you are, you.

404
00:31:28,371 --> 00:31:30,118
How old is she?

405
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:35,495
She's
turning 10 next week.

406
00:31:35,536 --> 00:31:39,365
I heard she's having a big birthday
party. - No, no, no. Not the kid. Her.

407
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:44,397
That's Arden's grandmother.
- She's perfect.

408
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:47,733
Name? - I think it's
Celeste.  - Celeste what?

409
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:50,341
Celeste Birch.
- Is there a grandpa Birch?

410
00:31:50,637 --> 00:31:54,065
He died last year. - Great! Great.
That's great news.  He's dead!

411
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:58,190
I'm so very sad.

412
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,785
Life's a gift.

413
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,699
Okay kid. Have a great day.
- But I thought you wanted to walk me in.

414
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:07,996
What are you, a baby?
You can walk yourself in.

415
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:09,939
Andale vamos.

416
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,222
I've got work to do.

417
00:32:15,037 --> 00:32:16,530
Hey!

418
00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:20,800
May I help you?
- It's me, Maximo.

419
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:23,031
I'm an old friend of Celeste's.

420
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:26,697
I feel like we've
met before, right?

421
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:30,699
I don't think so. - I think so.
- You're Ryan, right?  - Quincy.

422
00:32:30,736 --> 00:32:35,338
I knew it started with a Q
or a B or a S. Quincy.

423
00:32:35,373 --> 00:32:36,898
That's a great name, Quincy.

424
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:39,216
I was named after
my grandfather's dog.

425
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:45,029
The legacy lives on.
- Don't touch me.  - Oh, yeah.

426
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:47,100
And where did you say
you met Celeste?

427
00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:51,464
At the sports event.

428
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:55,097
The polo match.
- Yes, exactly.

429
00:32:56,902 --> 00:32:59,431
The one back in April.
- Yeah, that's the one.

430
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:01,733
She never went to a
polo match back in April.

431
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:06,563
May? - No.
- June?  - No.

432
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:08,728
July? - No.
- August?  - No.

433
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,189
September? - No. - October?
- No. - November?  - No.

434
00:33:11,224 --> 00:33:13,531
December? - No. - January?
- No. -  February?  - No.

435
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:15,799
March.
- No.

436
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,203
April.
- You already said April.

437
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:21,124
And you said?

438
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,471
No.

439
00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:29,107
Oh, oh, I am so sorry.
I must have gotten confused.

440
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:32,651
March. - No.
- Of course. Thanks.

441
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,864
Pizza delivery.

442
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:45,763
Hey man, what's up?
I'm a little busy.

443
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:49,578
Listen, I think I found my next wife.
- You've heard of Celeste Birch?

444
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:52,864
<i>Celeste Birch?</i>
She's worth  10 Peggy von Strauss's.

445
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:55,092
<i>You ever meet her?
- I haven't had the pleasure.</i>

446
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:57,924
But, Millicent was supposed to
go her charity function today

447
00:33:57,959 --> 00:34:00,606
at the Pacific Woodruff.
- Pacific Woodruff, today?

448
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:04,529
Yeah. I mean, go get her.
<i>He's the best 500 bucks you ever spent.</i>

449
00:34:04,969 --> 00:34:08,696
500 dollars! - <i>Yes, that's
the cost of the charity ticket.</i>

450
00:34:08,738 --> 00:34:10,432
That seems like the
opposite of charity.

451
00:34:10,468 --> 00:34:12,462
Pizza boy...
- I've got to go. Duty calls.

452
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:17,364
One extra large
sausage. That'll be $17.15.

453
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:20,480
I'm afraid I don't have
any change.

454
00:34:20,515 --> 00:34:22,997
Well, maybe we'll have to
work something between us.

455
00:34:24,836 --> 00:34:26,763

Hi, I need to get my car wrapped...
and I need the cash up front.

00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:53,062
Bro. Is he here about the bike?
Are you here about the bike?  - No.

462
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,692
Bro, he's not here for this
stupid tiny bike, alright?

463
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,285
He got the thing online,
you idiot.

464

We all make mistakes, okay?
- You're not perfect.

465
00:34:59,868 --> 00:35:02,759
I misunderstood the dimensions.
- It happens.

466
00:35:02,794 --> 00:35:05,433
Anyway, you thought about what kind
of edge you wanna wrap your car in?

467
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:07,693
Whatever... - This looked
a lot bigger on the Internet

468
00:35:07,735 --> 00:35:11,759
because it had a picture with a
little boy, so it seemed much bigger.

469
00:35:11,794 --> 00:35:13,583
Great. - How do he
not know the difference

470
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:15,065
between a little
boy and a grown man?

471
00:35:15,103 --> 00:35:17,031
He looked older, he had a
little bit of a mustache.

472
00:35:17,067 --> 00:35:18,550
Look at this.
This was in the picture.

473
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:21,166
It was a boy with the mustache
so I assume...

474
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:22,463
Whatever pays the most!

475
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:26,897
Oh, sorry.

476
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:32,289
Was that rude? I'm in a rush,
that's all. I'm in a rush.

477
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:34,200
Man's in a rush.
- Yes, thank you.

478
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:37,364
Here's the terms. Wrap stays
on the car for ninety days.

479
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:38,966
Yes. - You take
it off before that,

480
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:40,532
you  have to pay
us the money back.

481
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:44,019
Not a problem. Yeah.
- Leave the warp on the vehicle.

482
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:46,718
Yes, I will do that. Can we
start as soon as possible?

- Ahhh!

501
00:38:23,832 --> 00:38:25,037
Sorry.

502
00:38:26,132 --> 00:38:27,791
Am I making you wet?

503
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,061
No, no. Bone dry. Thanks for
asking, though. Come on.

504
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,092
Unhand me, sir.
I just wanna speak to Celeste.

505
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:38,297
Listen, Menudo, you think you're
the first money grabbing gigolo

506
00:38:38,546 --> 00:38:40,484
to throw himself at my boss?
- Maybe not the first,

507
00:38:40,782 --> 00:38:42,278
but I'm hoping to
be the last now.

508
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:44,647
Not while I'm working for her.

509
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:47,439
She's been through too much
emotionally and surgically

510
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,313
to put up with this.
- You can't keep me away.

511
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:54,458
No, I can. - No.
- Very easily I can.  - No.

512
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,487
I just did.

513
00:38:57,841 --> 00:38:58,688
Yes, you did.

514
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:01,480
So unless you have a written
invitation to our home,

515
00:39:02,565 --> 00:39:04,121
you're not going
anywhere near her.

516
00:39:05,668 --> 00:39:07,728
Hey, there's your clown suit.

517
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:11,224
Alright, here's your...
car... toon.

518
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:13,778
I kept it close just like
you asked me to, paisano.

519
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:15,613
I don't speak Spanish.

520
00:39:21,865 --> 00:39:25,793
Hi bro. Did you make a move?
- I sort of made a move.

521
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:27,270
Can you talk?
- <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

522
00:39:28,008 --> 00:39:29,463
<i>Millicent's just
taking a post coital cool off.</i>

523
00:39:30,065 --> 00:39:33,659
Tell me you closed her. Tell me you
closed her during silent auction.

524
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:36,870
<i>She didn't even see me.
I'm not sure about this one.</i>

525
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:40,270
She's impossible to
get to. I have no in.

526
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:51,816
Or maybe I do.

527
00:39:55,632 --> 00:39:59,527
Sounds like you have an idea.
But I can't tell. I can't see your face.

528
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:02,859
<i>Describe your face. - My face?</i>
- Yeah. What does it look like?

529
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:05,493
Thoughtful, very handsome
with a hint of mischief.

530
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:08,297
That's the spirit. Hey, I'm there
for you, whatever you need.

531
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:10,917
Unless it's money. Then I can't do it.
Because I'm on an allowance.

532
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:14,951
Great. Listen. Find out whatever
you can about Celeste.

533
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:18,277
Interest, passions, hobbies.
When I'm invited to her home,

534
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:23,041
I plan on selling the deal.
- <i>I'll ask her on the club.  - Thanks.</i>

535
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,546
And I've got work
to do on my end.

536
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:33,841
Hey. Hey!

537
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,721
My eyes are up here. Get in.

538
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:42,772
Usually we come here on Sundays

539
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,707
because mom says it's too much sugar
to have more than once a week.

540
00:40:46,097 --> 00:40:47,656
Yeah.
- Wow.

541
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:50,677
So, Hugo I wanna talk to you
about Arden...

542
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:53,646
<i>Froyo Lo, look out
That's right</i>

543
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:56,903
<i>You've got to let your
fantasies out For a bite</i>

544
00:40:57,464 --> 00:41:00,791
<i>Say your name...
- Hugo. - ain't no shame</i>

545
00:41:00,832 --> 00:41:05,727
<i>Froyo Lo, Froyo Lo</i>

546
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,672
Do they make you sing
that every time?

547
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,696
I get to sing that every time.

548
00:41:10,665 --> 00:41:13,265
You know if you guess the weight
of your yogurt, it's on the house.

549
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,148
Five pounds.
- That's a lot.

550
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:20,174
I'll give you one more guess.
- Thirty pounds.  - Let's check.

551
00:41:21,365 --> 00:41:24,728
Wow, they're fourteen ounces.
- I was so close.

552
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:28,326
That will be six fifty.
- Hey, watch me and learn.

553
00:41:30,098 --> 00:41:32,128
I like your bandages.

554
00:41:32,663 --> 00:41:35,935
I am...
I have a lot of rescue cats.

555
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,692
Really? - Yeah, so I'm
no stranger to scratches.

556
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:40,297
I'm always bleeding.

557
00:41:41,797 --> 00:41:42,835
Thank you...

558
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:45,991
Cindy.
- Wow. Cindy.

559
00:41:46,029 --> 00:41:49,020
What an enchanting name.
- Thank you.

560
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,877
You know, if these frozen yogurts
were half as sweet as you,

561
00:41:52,796 --> 00:41:54,338
we're in for quite a treat.

562
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,410
Wow!

563
00:42:00,496 --> 00:42:02,411
You said fourteen ounces, right?

564
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:05,997
Gracias, sweet Cindy.

565
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,390
I hope your pussy cats realize what a
beautiful scratching post they have in you.

566
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:13,236
Bye.

567
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,701
I am a beautiful
scratching post.

568
00:42:17,098 --> 00:42:21,013
See what I did there?
- You got us FroYo for free?

569
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:24,883
No, my skills of seduction
got us FroYo for free

570
00:42:25,564 --> 00:42:29,275
What if I told you I can teach you
how to use your skills of seduction

571
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,877
to get what you want.

572
00:42:30,912 --> 00:42:33,775
I forgot to ask
for gummy bears.

573
00:42:33,795 --> 00:42:36,776
Screw the gummy bears.
I'm talking about Arden.

574
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,617
Hey, I can get you invited
to her birthday party.

575
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:46,459
Would you like that? - You can't get
me invited to Arden's birthday party.

576
00:42:46,495 --> 00:42:48,637
Papa por favor.

577
00:42:48,672 --> 00:42:50,926
It's impossible.
- Somebody asked for gummy bears?

578
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:54,238
They're on the house.
- Thank you, sweet Cindy.

579
00:42:54,273 --> 00:42:57,413
I have gummy bears coming
out of my ears, literally.

580
00:42:57,563 --> 00:43:01,110
Not literally, but they are in a
surprising amount of places around here.

581
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,193
Hey, thank you.

582
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:07,730
See, I can make things
happen for you.

583
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,217
When do we start?

584
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:19,819
We just did.
Okay, lesson number one.

585
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,692
Eye contact. Follow me.

586
00:43:22,862 --> 00:43:24,623
Follow me. Eye contact.

587
00:43:24,664 --> 00:43:27,627
Okay.
- Eye contact is power, Hugo.

588
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:29,821
Women will lust after you.

589
00:43:29,856 --> 00:43:33,327
Now, it's your turn. I am
Arden, okay? Say hello to me.

590
00:43:33,598 --> 00:43:37,240
Okay.
- Hello Hugo, I'm Arden.

591
00:43:37,629 --> 00:43:39,465
Hello, Arden.

592
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:41,550
You broke eye contact.

593
00:43:42,168 --> 00:43:45,985
You broke eye contact.
- You threw a gummy bear at me.

594
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,356
What? Life will throw gummy
bears at you. Okay. Do it again.

595
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:52,092
Stop throwing gummy bears at me.
- Stop breaking eye contact.

596
00:43:55,995 --> 00:43:57,492
Hello, Arden.

597
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:04,270
Not bad. Good eye contact.

598
00:44:04,628 --> 00:44:06,199
Not bad at all.

599
00:44:07,063 --> 00:44:09,742
You guys are getting real
creative with these gummy bears.

600
00:44:09,777 --> 00:44:12,782
Most people just eat them.
- Okay,  lesson number two...

601
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,119
Women love when men take control

602
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:17,598
because women have no idea
what they wants.

603
00:44:18,694 --> 00:44:21,664
I'll have the steak and the lady
would have the cobb salad.

604
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:24,545
What if she doesn't want
the cobb salad?

605
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:29,699
Listen, a woman would rather eat something
you ordered for her, that she doesn't want

606
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:33,087
rather than something she ordered
for herself that she does want.

607
00:44:33,729 --> 00:44:36,648
It doesn't make sense.
Like, at all.

608
00:44:36,863 --> 00:44:38,626
You know what
doesn't make sense?

609
00:44:38,994 --> 00:44:42,002
What is that? You under
house arrest or what?

610
00:44:42,037 --> 00:44:44,237
It's a planetary watch.

611
00:44:44,272 --> 00:44:46,947
Some people call it
an astronomical watch.

612
00:44:46,982 --> 00:44:49,475
I'm gonna call it I'm
gonna die a virgin watch.

613
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,677
Lose it. Let's go.

614
00:44:53,693 --> 00:44:56,487
Wait, uncle Maximo.
What is a virgin?

615
00:44:56,729 --> 00:45:00,481
It's an airline. Last
lesson of the day...  Your walk.

616
00:45:00,594 --> 00:45:04,368
Your walk tells more about you
than your mouth ever can.

617
00:45:04,596 --> 00:45:07,368
My walk? - Yes, your
walk. Show me your walk.

618
00:45:08,795 --> 00:45:12,161
Do I just walk? - Just walk, walk.
- Okay.  - Like you walk.

619
00:45:15,899 --> 00:45:17,052
Goddamned!

620
00:45:20,694 --> 00:45:22,944
Horse shit.
Sit and watch.

621
00:45:25,126 --> 00:45:28,478
Loose stride,
sleepy eyes,

622
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:30,791
smiling just a little bit
because you know what

623
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:34,927
all the ladies are thinking.
- What are the ladies thinking?

624
00:45:34,962 --> 00:45:36,323
Look at that confidence,

625
00:45:36,928 --> 00:45:40,263
he must be great in bed.
- I'm great in bed.

626
00:45:40,361 --> 00:45:43,093
What? - I don't pee
or anything anymore.

627
00:45:44,497 --> 00:45:46,624
Come on now,
my boy. Let's walk.

628
00:45:48,925 --> 00:45:52,097
Loose stride, sleepy eyes.

629
00:45:52,132 --> 00:45:53,273
What are you doing?

630
00:45:53,308 --> 00:45:56,450
Pretend there's a girl, and
you're walking towards her.

631
00:45:56,485 --> 00:45:58,907
Feel your sexiness.
- I don't feel my sexy.

632
00:45:58,942 --> 00:46:01,595
What is that? You're walking
exactly like the geese.

633
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,499
Let's go.
Don't watch the geese, okay?

634
00:46:03,534 --> 00:46:08,325
A girl pass by, turn around,
walk backwards, sexy, sexy.

635
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,813
What is this? What is this?
What is this?

636
00:46:12,492 --> 00:46:14,736
One more time.
Feel it in your crotch.

637
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,817
You want everyone
to see down here.

638
00:46:16,852 --> 00:46:19,379
No, I don't.
- Look at me.

639
00:46:19,414 --> 00:46:21,688
You learn from the best.
Okay, one more time.

640
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:30,122
You feel sexy right now?
- Yeah. - Great. Okay, one more time.

641
00:46:41,928 --> 00:46:45,572
Exactly, exactly,
exactly.

642
00:46:45,607 --> 00:46:48,099
There you go. Much better.

643
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,721
Shit.
Okay.

644
00:46:51,594 --> 00:46:53,285
One more time.

645
00:46:53,862 --> 00:46:58,083
Gwen, I wanted to see if you
heard  back on the Robinson account.

646
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:02,387
Sara,

647
00:47:01,792 --> 00:47:05,187
before you could
ask me about this.
- I know, sorry.

648
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:07,837
I can ask you again tomorrow as
soon as you get out of the car.

649
00:47:07,872 --> 00:47:10,955
No, no.
Can't unbreak this egg.

650
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:14,845
Alright, they loved you. They
thought you were incredible.

651
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,920
But they're gonna go
with someone who has...

652
00:47:16,955 --> 00:47:19,210
More experience.
- Sorry, can I finish?

653
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:23,496
Sorry...
Yes, yes...

654
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:25,705
Someone who
has more experience.

655
00:47:26,993 --> 00:47:29,936
You finished?
- Yeah.

656
00:47:30,992 --> 00:47:32,884
I just don't know what to do.

657
00:47:32,919 --> 00:47:35,501
I can't get a job because
I don't have experience

658
00:47:35,536 --> 00:47:37,670
and I can't get experience
if I don't get a job.

659
00:47:37,705 --> 00:47:40,046
Hey mom.
- I'm here.

660
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:44,409
5:00. I remembered. You have
nothing to complain about.

661
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:47,663
I thought you'd be happy.
I got a job.

662
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,800
Turning my car into a
stripper mobile is not a job.

663
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:52,904
What's a stripper?
- It's only nine days.

664
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:55,580
No, it's not. You get this
trash off my car today.

665
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:57,557
Damed.
- Today!

666
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:01,358
Alright now, those guys, they...
no wait, girls...

667
00:48:01,427 --> 00:48:04,952
they dance on
the poles naked, right?

668
00:48:17,993 --> 00:48:22,919
Icebergs are literally just floating
ice on the water - Wow, astonishing.

669
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:26,386
So when it melts, it's like
soda, it's like bubbles.

670
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:29,619
Bubbles, wow. - Carbon dioxide.
- Where's your watch?

671
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:32,034
You mean,
my die a virgin watch?

672
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,752
What did you say?
- Die a virgin watch.

673
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:38,938
Kids. Where do they come up
with this stuff?

674
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:41,410
Uncle Maximo told me to
take it off.

675
00:48:41,725 --> 00:48:45,420
He's training me to get girls
to like me. - He's training you?

676
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:46,819
Yeah. - What the
hell are you doing?

677
00:48:46,861 --> 00:48:50,663
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It's just silly guy talk. - It's not silly.

678
00:48:50,698 --> 00:48:53,272
I learned how to undress
a woman with my eyes.

679
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:56,347
And how to walk so a woman
would know I'm gonna bed.

680
00:48:56,594 --> 00:48:58,847
He said women have
no idea what they want

681
00:48:58,882 --> 00:49:00,824
and you have to
tell them what to do.

682
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:07,064
No, I never used
those words exactly.

683
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:10,282
Sure you did. I wrote it
all down in this notebook.

684
00:49:10,426 --> 00:49:12,072
What notebook?
- Lesson number...

685
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:24,353
<i>Mira.</i> Hugo needs to
focus  on his school work.

686
00:49:24,427 --> 00:49:28,115
Hey, he has a crush on a girl
at school. I'm trying to help the kid.

687
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:31,525
You know what it's like
to like someone! Or no?

688
00:49:31,723 --> 00:49:35,566
Mister "I need you to
grease my door once a week".

689
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:38,386
No. You're taking
one think for another.

690
00:49:38,387 --> 00:49:41,974
And James is just a friend!
- Oh, my God. - You're changing the subject!

691
00:49:42,825 --> 00:49:46,416
No more sugar mama
catching training!

692
00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:53,432
Hugo already has a mother.
Understood?  - Yes, mommy.

693
00:49:53,692 --> 00:49:56,578
Understood?
- I don't speak English.

694
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:02,468
Don't be an idiot.
- Why with a tortilla?

695
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,452
Hey, pull my finger. Pull it.

696
00:50:12,058 --> 00:50:15,956
False alarm. - Yeah.
- You're writing a love letter to Arden?

697
00:50:15,989 --> 00:50:18,062
No, just writing to my dad.

698
00:50:19,092 --> 00:50:20,304
Your dad?

699
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:23,169
You know he'll never
get those letters, right?

700
00:50:23,204 --> 00:50:24,273
I know.

701
00:50:24,524 --> 00:50:26,635
It's just a way
for me to feel close then.

702
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,349
Don't you ever think
about your dad?

703
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:34,036
No. - Never?
- Never.

704
00:50:34,722 --> 00:50:36,814
You remember anything about him?

705
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:39,479
I remember he worked a lot.

706
00:50:40,023 --> 00:50:42,945
And he parked his truck
in our house once.

707
00:50:44,724 --> 00:50:46,491
There it is. Late bloomer.

708
00:50:47,926 --> 00:50:49,860
I remember a lot about my dad.

709
00:50:50,124 --> 00:50:53,772
He was fun. I think he'd
be happy that you're here

710
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:55,853
and that you're helping me.

711
00:50:56,658 --> 00:50:58,503
That's what I was
just writing him.

712
00:51:03,023 --> 00:51:06,390
Uncle Maximo, can I show you
my science project?

713
00:51:06,824 --> 00:51:09,054
I... in the morning.

714
00:51:09,126 --> 00:51:10,448
Please?

715
00:51:11,658 --> 00:51:14,118
I know that you're
really not sleeping.

716
00:51:18,357 --> 00:51:20,855
Uncle Maximo, please?

717
00:51:22,356 --> 00:51:24,048
Okay. In the morning.

718
00:51:26,923 --> 00:51:29,584
Good morning. Uncle Maximo.

719
00:51:29,724 --> 00:51:31,561
Remember when you told me

720
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:34,496
that I can show you my science
fair project in the morning?

721
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:37,177
Well, here it is!
My weather balloon.

722
00:51:37,212 --> 00:51:39,251
And here is the Go Pro camera

723
00:51:39,286 --> 00:51:41,882
which will be attached
to the weather balloon

724
00:51:41,917 --> 00:51:44,219
which will go up in space.

725
00:51:44,756 --> 00:51:48,299
It's cool, right?
- Amazing.

726
00:51:48,657 --> 00:51:53,469
Now, will you please get it off my
face so I can go back to sleep?

727
00:51:53,504 --> 00:51:57,004
<i>Get up, flojo naso!</i>
Time to go get a job.

728
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,199
Here, I circled the ones that I think
will be good for your qualifications

729
00:52:01,424 --> 00:52:06,601
like human statue, mattress
tester, dog poop picker upper...

730
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:10,010
It's Sunday.
What place will even be open?

731
00:52:10,758 --> 00:52:12,161
It's Thursday.

732
00:52:13,457 --> 00:52:16,084
Want me to deflate the balloon?
- Let's go Hugo.

733
00:52:16,124 --> 00:52:19,829
The science fair is next Sunday,
the school is today.

734
00:52:19,864 --> 00:52:23,244
Hey, no. Hugo!
Hey, Sara!

735
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:24,662
Get a job!

736
00:52:28,572 --> 00:52:30,505
WESCOTT CONDOMINIUMS

CAR WASH
LIMITED MONTLY WASH PLAN

738
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:16,764
Sorry!
- I'm okay! I am okay.

739
00:53:17,589 --> 00:53:19,949
He's okay.

740
00:53:26,589 --> 00:53:28,824
It wasn't me, it wasn't me.
I'm alright.

741
00:53:31,629 --> 00:53:32,861
HIGHLAND
CAFE

742
00:53:33,645 --> 00:53:34,943
This neighborhood
isn't that bad.

743
00:53:35,555 --> 00:53:37,282
I was expecting something out
of a horror movie,

744
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,049
this is more like something out
of an independent movie.

745
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:42,869
Stop trying to make me feel better.
- Stop trying to make <i>me</i> feel better.

746
00:53:44,687 --> 00:53:46,412
Are you teasing me?
- Teasing me.

747
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,271
Hey, what are you doing?

748
00:53:49,023 --> 00:53:52,296
I'm sorry. Millicent's just
fantasizing about this...

749
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:56,404
Professor Rojas. She's got me
dressing like him, talking like him,

750
00:53:56,655 --> 00:53:58,418
but, I can't do an accent to
save my life.

751
00:53:58,955 --> 00:54:01,466
And I can't sleep on an air
mattress one more night.

752
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,668
You find any intel
or Celeste Birch?

753
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:08,997
As as matter of fact, I did.
And before I share this,

754
00:54:09,456 --> 00:54:12,430
I don't think she's the
right mark for you. - Come on.

755
00:54:14,356 --> 00:54:17,984
Celeste Birch's passions, avid
mountain climber, loves train travel,

756
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,770
favorite food, fried chicken.

757
00:54:20,122 --> 00:54:22,083
Great. This will help.
Thanks.

758
00:54:22,122 --> 00:54:25,847
Alright. It is time to go.
Anything?  - Terrible.

759
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,916
It's time to go.
- You sound like Dora the explorer.

760
00:54:28,954 --> 00:54:31,172
Now's the go,
when it's time to go.

761
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:34,959
Speedy Gonzales. Really.
- Alright. Ola.

762
00:54:35,889 --> 00:54:39,480
Everybody knows how to say that.
- And somehow you screwed it up.

763
00:54:42,854 --> 00:54:44,514
Hola.

764
00:54:46,055 --> 00:54:49,369
I'm positive, that's the car.
- But why would we pay him,

765
00:54:49,521 --> 00:54:51,075
if he's not gonna do it.

766
00:54:53,354 --> 00:54:54,759
We paid him all our money.

767
00:54:56,389 --> 00:54:57,682
Hey, hey, hey!

768
00:55:01,453 --> 00:55:03,062
Stop! Stop!

769
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,413
Well, look who it is.

770
00:55:19,822 --> 00:55:22,372
No, no, no, no.
Where do you think you're going?

771
00:55:22,407 --> 00:55:23,915
Where you going, man?
- Just looking for you guys.

772
00:55:23,955 --> 00:55:25,872
I was just looking for you guys.

773
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:29,999
We clearly said,
don't take the wrap off!

774
00:55:30,034 --> 00:55:31,296
Ever!

775
00:55:31,386 --> 00:55:35,520
Yes, yes, I remember and I thought you
did a great job with the wrapping.

776
00:55:35,555 --> 00:55:38,048
But, you see my sister
felt differently.

777
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:43,335
She's your sister.
- Yeah  - Sister.

778
00:55:43,488 --> 00:55:47,199
Women. - Right, right.
- You don't have to tell Nick and I about that.

779
00:55:48,453 --> 00:55:50,853
Get his nuts.
- I got them.  - Get his nuts.

780
00:55:50,888 --> 00:55:54,415
I got both of them.
- I got them.

781
00:55:54,453 --> 00:55:58,330
You just give us our money.
We'll be fine. - I spent it. I spent it.

782
00:55:58,385 --> 00:56:04,453
Well, I sincerely hope you bought
something you really wanted... or needed.

783
00:56:07,354 --> 00:56:10,185
God, you're terrible with this.
Nick, just think before you talk.

784
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:11,809
Can you do that?
- Stop.

785
00:56:11,844 --> 00:56:14,980
I made a mistake. I'll get you
your money, I promise.

786
00:56:17,753 --> 00:56:21,292
Come on guys. It's just
a thousand dollars.

787
00:56:21,327 --> 00:56:23,932
One week. You got one week.
- Yes.

788
00:56:24,986 --> 00:56:28,828
Let's go.
- I didn't see that coming. Nice!

789
00:56:28,863 --> 00:56:30,184
Thought we're done, right?
You feel that?

790
00:56:30,421 --> 00:56:34,014
Two hands. You want four hands?
- That's four hands.  - Yeah, there it is.

791
00:56:34,054 --> 00:56:36,072
That's four hands.
- One week.

792
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,702
One week, home boy.

793
00:56:40,887 --> 00:56:44,559
We went four hands on
him, man. - That was bad ass.

794
00:56:44,594 --> 00:56:45,748
His balls are so big.

795
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:48,415
You get that money or next time
it's eight hands.

796
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,273
Guy doesn't have $1000,
get a job, bone head.

797
00:56:54,022 --> 00:56:57,362
<i>Froyo Lo look out
That's right</i>

798
00:56:57,517 --> 00:57:01,478
<i>You've got to let your
fantasies out For a bite</i>

799
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,596
<i>Say your name... Jose!
Ain't no shame</i>

800
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,006
<i>Froyo Lo!
Froyo Lo!</i>

801
00:57:08,886 --> 00:57:10,391
Such a good effort.

802
00:57:10,487 --> 00:57:14,339
It's only lacking joy, soul,
rhythm and musicality.

803
00:57:14,353 --> 00:57:17,065
And I would cry way less.
Maybe not at all.

804
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:28,983
<i>But, what if mom finds out
we're training again?</i>

805
00:57:29,021 --> 00:57:33,114
Hugo, you can't live your life afraid
that something bad will happen.

806
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,444
Or you'll never really live.
- Okay.

807
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:39,101
So, you gotten her to notice
you with the sexy walk.

808
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:41,543
You intrigued her with
strong eye contact.

809
00:57:41,578 --> 00:57:43,781
Now, it's time to talk to her.

810
00:57:43,821 --> 00:57:45,775
I don't think I can.

811
00:57:45,785 --> 00:57:50,027
Relax, Hugo. It's not like you've
never talked to a girl before.

812
00:57:50,062 --> 00:57:53,678
Yes, it is. I've never talked to
a girl before. - Really?  - Yeah.

813
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:57,265
They make me really nervous
and then my nose start to sweat.

814
00:57:58,353 --> 00:58:00,522
Your nose sweats?
- Yeah.

815
00:58:00,557 --> 00:58:02,948
Your nose?
- Yes.

816
00:58:03,686 --> 00:58:06,862
I can't help you with that.
- Stop mocking me.

817
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,527
Well, come on. Let's go.
- Well, where are we going?

818
00:58:10,562 --> 00:58:13,072
You're too in your head, kid.
You need to relax.

819
00:58:21,452 --> 00:58:25,381
I don't like the bowling
balls here. Too slippery.

820
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,710
I'm gonna grab a
Coke. You want one?

821
00:58:27,374 --> 00:58:29,192
Cokes have no
nutritional value.

822
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:31,235
Neither do eggplants.

823
00:58:32,352 --> 00:58:33,509
Okay, two Cokes.

824
00:58:41,052 --> 00:58:42,380
Nice form.

825
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:49,080
Thanks. - My name
is Gabi.  What's yours?

826
00:58:49,987 --> 00:58:53,452
My name is Hugo.
- You're cute, Hugo.

827
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,958
Thank you.
- See you.  - Thank you.

828
00:59:00,993 --> 00:59:02,334
Thank you.

829
00:59:03,854 --> 00:59:06,326
What was that?
- She just called me cute!

830
00:59:06,454 --> 00:59:07,712
She said you were cute?
- Yes.

831
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:11,185
I guess my mom's not the only
one who thinks that. - Guess not.

832
00:59:13,052 --> 00:59:15,625
What is that crap on
your nose? - It's sweat.

833
00:59:17,115 --> 00:59:18,736
BOWLING

834
00:59:18,771 --> 00:59:22,045
Oh! Wait! My shoes.
Okay, I'll be right back.

835
00:59:22,085 --> 00:59:23,896
Don't get kidnapped.
- Okay.

836
00:59:27,019 --> 00:59:29,427
Thank you. Those please.

837
00:59:31,117 --> 00:59:33,616
Nice work.
- I aim to please.

838
00:59:37,918 --> 00:59:41,520
Okay, remember...
Eye contact and confidence.

839
00:59:41,585 --> 00:59:45,315
Come on, take that off.
You can do it.  Now we are talking.

840
00:59:45,351 --> 00:59:47,518
Look at that,
you're a Greek god.

841
00:59:47,819 --> 00:59:49,711
Abs of steel.
- Yeah.

842
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,368
Yeah.
- Is my nose sweating?

843
00:59:52,452 --> 00:59:55,675
Yeah, little bit. But, it will wash
out when you get in the water.

844
00:59:55,785 --> 00:59:58,812
Okay. - Okay, come on.
Go get her. You can do this.

845
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:00,498
Come on, Stalker.

846
01:00:24,615 --> 01:00:27,302
Do you need a towel?
- No, no, no.

847
01:00:30,751 --> 01:00:32,579
Eye contact, eye contact!

848
01:00:34,982 --> 01:00:37,578
Hi, Arden.
- Hi, Hugo.

849
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:41,952
You know my name?
- Yeah, I know your name.

850
01:00:42,051 --> 01:00:45,978
You said you know by
mean H-I, not H-I-G-H.

851
01:00:46,818 --> 01:00:47,874
Okay.

852
01:00:49,851 --> 01:00:52,945
<i>Let's go ladies, practice is over.
Got to clear the pool area.</i>

853
01:00:53,711 --> 01:00:54,442
<i>Hurry up.</i>

854
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:00,812
Yes!

855
01:01:02,351 --> 01:01:03,477
Yes!

856
01:01:03,518 --> 01:01:06,845
Yes, yes, yes!

857
01:01:06,884 --> 01:01:08,612
Yes?
- Yes!

858
01:01:08,652 --> 01:01:11,347
Yes? - She invited
me to her party!

859
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:15,778
She invited me to her party!

860
01:01:19,553 --> 01:01:22,862
We did it!
Exactly what I needed!

861
01:01:22,897 --> 01:01:25,876
Yes! - Yes! - Do you see
my nephew happy?  - Yes!

862
01:01:26,685 --> 01:01:28,615
Yeah man, you got it!

863
01:01:35,383 --> 01:01:37,944
I heard about the
Pasadena project. - Yeah.

864
01:01:37,982 --> 01:01:41,344
Listen, I have some ideas.
I know it's a long shot, but

865
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:44,395
please take a look.
I'd love a chance.

866
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,835
And I promise that I'd treat
like my own child.

867
01:01:52,184 --> 01:01:55,459
Hey mom. The 101
was wide open.

868
01:01:57,615 --> 01:02:00,450
It's okay. I just let him drive
from around the block.

869
01:02:02,517 --> 01:02:05,121
Don't worry, I'm not one of those
people concerned about children.

870
01:02:06,553 --> 01:02:10,521
Hugo, that's wonderful.
A party with other kids.

871
01:02:10,614 --> 01:02:13,803
So can I go? - Of course,
I'll take you.  It'll be great.

872
01:02:14,709 --> 01:02:15,597
Ou, ou, ou, ou!

873
01:02:16,418 --> 01:02:19,556
Sara, you work so hard.
I will take him.

874
01:02:19,817 --> 01:02:23,226
Are you kidding me? I can't wait
to see all his new friends.

875
01:02:23,517 --> 01:02:26,869
Plus, we could see the big mansion
of the grandmother, right?

876
01:02:26,904 --> 01:02:31,338
Hey, no offense, but I think Hugo
would mush rather go with me.

877
01:02:31,383 --> 01:02:34,484
I mean, look at you.
Look at me.

878
01:02:34,981 --> 01:02:37,363
Look at you.
- Maximo, Maximo...

879
01:02:37,514 --> 01:02:40,363
The words should sound
right in your head

880
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:43,459
before they leave the lips
in your stupid face.

881
01:02:43,494 --> 01:02:46,192
I don't care who brings me.
I'm just excited to go.

882
01:02:46,227 --> 01:02:47,526
I'm bringing you, honey.

883
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,566
I'm sure uncle Maximo has better
things to do on a Saturday. - Okay.

884
01:03:01,515 --> 01:03:04,959
James. - Shit!
You scared me!

885
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:09,094
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- It's Maximo, Sara's brother.

886
01:03:09,129 --> 01:03:10,902
Yeah, why are you
hiding in my garbage?

887
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:13,686
We need to talk.
It's about Sara.

888
01:03:14,016 --> 01:03:16,872
My God, what happened?
- It's not what happened,

889
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:19,057
it's what hasn't happened.

890
01:03:19,682 --> 01:03:21,510
I don't understand.
What do you mean? - James,

891
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:25,915
I'm not saying I get it,
but she likes you.

892
01:03:27,648 --> 01:03:28,691
Yeah?
- Yeah.

893
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,050
Hey, I have an idea.

894
01:03:33,815 --> 01:03:36,298
Take her out on Saturday.

895
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:39,939
Saturday? - Don't you
think  you waited long enough?

896
01:03:41,549 --> 01:03:42,925
Door.

897
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:53,410
Please don't bother yourself.
You just keep doing nothing there

898
01:03:53,449 --> 01:03:57,183
while I cook and I open the
door, and whatever else you need.

899
01:03:57,218 --> 01:04:00,597
Hi.
- Hi, James.  - Hi

900
01:04:00,715 --> 01:04:06,047
Is it the door again? I'll go
get my tools. - No, no, no. Actually it's...

901
01:04:07,513 --> 01:04:09,037
It's...

902
01:04:09,515 --> 01:04:10,718
It's my sink.

903
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,760
I was just kidding
about my sink.

904
01:04:17,749 --> 01:04:21,014
Funny.
- So, do you need something?

905
01:04:21,081 --> 01:04:23,838
Or did you just come here
to tell the sink joke?

906
01:04:23,873 --> 01:04:27,351
No, no, no. Actually, I didn't.
I mean, I did, but I...

907
01:04:27,386 --> 01:04:31,262
I came here to ask you if you're free
on Saturday and if you wanted to...

908
01:04:33,547 --> 01:04:35,625
If you wanted to come out
on a date with me.

909
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,761
What?

910
01:04:43,414 --> 01:04:44,833
I don't know.

911
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:48,365
Okay.
- Mom, are you okay?

912
01:04:48,913 --> 01:04:53,393
You wanna think about it?
- I don't know.  - She's acting weird.

913
01:04:53,428 --> 01:04:55,908
Maybe? - Yeah, she'll just think
about it and get back to you.

914
01:04:55,949 --> 01:04:58,777
Okay, fine. But, you know
let me know either way.

915
01:04:59,748 --> 01:05:02,500
I told you.
- This guy likes you.

916
01:05:02,513 --> 01:05:05,852
I don't want to talk about it.
- Hey!  - I'm going to my room.

917
01:05:06,015 --> 01:05:07,781
Hey!
- Finish the dinner.

918
01:05:17,648 --> 01:05:18,775
Don't come in.

919
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:26,403
I'm sleeping.
- Hugo is asleep now.

920
01:05:27,887 --> 01:05:30,661
Why did you act
so weird? What's wrong?

921
01:05:31,349 --> 01:05:34,855
What do you think
is wrong? I'm rusty.

922
01:05:34,893 --> 01:05:37,959
I don't feel ready
to go out with anyone.

923
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:40,677
When was the last time?

924
01:05:43,485 --> 01:05:47,323
5 years ago. - I mean,
when was  the last time you...

925
01:05:47,363 --> 01:05:48,363
5 years.

926
01:05:51,075 --> 01:05:54,021
Seriously?
- Thant's enough!

927
01:05:55,705 --> 01:05:58,474
Are you serious?
- <i>Si. Okay?</i>

928
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:00,362
Stop laughing.

929
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:03,635
The bakery has been
closed for some time.

930
01:06:03,837 --> 01:06:07,192
Your pastry is going to go stale.
- You're such a jerk.

931
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:09,865
My God, what are
you waiting for?

932
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:12,891
I don't know.

933
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:16,099
You like this little gringo?

934
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:21,300
You like the gringo!

935
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:25,493
So go, then!

936
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,044
I'm afraid.

937
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:34,944
You know what I do
when I'm afraid? - Pray?

938
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,231
Drink.

939
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:54,296
My God, leave my bakery alone.
Don't talk to me about my bakery.

940
01:06:54,342 --> 01:06:55,971
No, but seriously...

941
01:06:56,009 --> 01:06:58,559
I don't know how
you've managed to go on,

942
01:06:58,595 --> 01:07:02,515
in spite of all your suffering,

943
01:07:02,557 --> 01:07:04,187
to keep going, to always
move forward...

944
01:07:05,977 --> 01:07:09,178
I can because of Hugo.
- Hugo, how?

945
01:07:10,731 --> 01:07:14,321
When my husband died,

946
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,608
there were days
when I couldn't even breathe.

947
01:07:19,105 --> 01:07:22,655
But, how do you explain to a small
child that he has to take care of himself,

948
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,410
because his mom wants to
lock herself in her room and cry?

949
01:07:26,162 --> 01:07:27,782
You can't.

950
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:36,468
But I have a trick for when
I'm very sad to lift me up.

951
01:07:36,588 --> 01:07:38,354
Anti-depressants?
- No.

952
01:07:38,924 --> 01:07:40,162
No, look...

953
01:07:41,592 --> 01:07:45,762
I take any sad song,

954
01:07:45,805 --> 01:07:49,291
and transform it into a salsa.
- A sad song?

955
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,310
What about The Sad One?
Let's go.

956
01:07:59,025 --> 01:08:00,655
You're stepping on me!

957
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:03,650
Come on. Let's go!
The Sad One!

958
01:08:05,197 --> 01:08:06,197
Come on!

959
01:08:16,624 --> 01:08:18,254
I'm falling asleep
this isn't a salsa.

960
01:09:21,045 --> 01:09:23,973
Mom. Mom!

961
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,631
Hugo!
Did we wake you up?

962
01:09:29,446 --> 01:09:33,144
Yes. You're singing very loudly
and bumping into things.

963
01:09:34,012 --> 01:09:36,066
Go to sleep. Both of you.

964
01:09:38,012 --> 01:09:39,273
Okay.

965
01:09:45,498 --> 01:09:48,877
You see? You're not rusty,
all you need to

966
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:51,115
is relax and have
fun, that's all!

967
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:57,173
You honestly don't mind
taking him to the party? - No.

968
01:09:57,676 --> 01:10:00,099
It would be the greatest
honor of my life.

969
01:10:01,136 --> 01:10:04,293
Let's go! Come on!
- Send him a text.

970
01:10:10,312 --> 01:10:13,772
That's my sister!
That's my sister! - Enough!

971
01:10:41,043 --> 01:10:42,037
Hugo.

972
01:10:45,611 --> 01:10:47,508
You have no room to judge.

973
01:10:53,976 --> 01:10:55,537
Sorry for the spill.

974
01:11:07,111 --> 01:11:09,061
What the hell
happened to me?

975
01:11:12,678 --> 01:11:15,909
Look what the cat dragged in!
- Pay day.  - Oh, great!

976
01:11:16,677 --> 01:11:17,399
Thank you.

977
01:11:20,808 --> 01:11:22,270
Hey, where's the rest of it?

978
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:25,512
Try feeding 50 cats
on that kind of money.

979
01:11:26,111 --> 01:11:28,137
It's meow-trageous!

990
01:11:56,543 --> 01:11:57,670

Sorry.

992
01:12:47,576 --> 01:12:48,569
Hey.

993
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:53,504
Behold the glory
of God's creation.

994
01:12:53,961 --> 01:12:57,929
Did you dye your hair?
- All of it.

995
01:12:58,215 --> 01:13:01,755
I gave myself a little makeover.
- Maybe next time,  they can makeover your brain.

996
01:13:02,469 --> 01:13:05,385
I know perfectly well...
I look very good.

997
01:13:06,431 --> 01:13:07,481
Very good.

998
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:13,550
I love you, stupid face.
- I love you too, little sister.

999
01:13:20,076 --> 01:13:22,304
What are you telling
your dad tonight?

1000
01:13:22,345 --> 01:13:25,185
Just that I'm excited
to go to Arden's party.

1001
01:13:25,476 --> 01:13:28,510
And that I'm glad
you're going with me.

1002
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:33,519
I patched it up for you.

1003
01:13:34,442 --> 01:13:36,149
So you can sleep better.

1004
01:13:41,909 --> 01:13:43,570
Give me a
piece of paper, Hugo.

1005
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:47,917
I wanna write a
letter too. - To who?

1006
01:13:49,942 --> 01:13:50,868
My dad.

1007
01:13:52,476 --> 01:13:55,302
I wanna tell him about
his amazing grandson.

1008
01:13:57,673 --> 01:14:00,164
Can we do this
every night? - Sure.

1009
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:04,462
It could be our thing.
Hey, pull my finger.

1010
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:08,435
Too late.
- Oh. - Sorry.

1011
01:14:19,608 --> 01:14:21,600
Today's the party!
- Really?

1012
01:14:21,942 --> 01:14:23,430
I haven't been
thinking about it.

1013
01:14:23,741 --> 01:14:25,733
Mommy's taking me
to get a hair cut.

1014
01:14:26,108 --> 01:14:29,437
Tell him not too short.
You don't have the ears for it.

1015
01:14:29,474 --> 01:14:30,679
Why don't you stop talking.

1016
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:32,898
You don't have the mouth
for it. Hugo, come here.

1017
01:14:33,642 --> 01:14:34,857
Hey!

1018
01:14:35,675 --> 01:14:39,433
I made the wall!
Wow, what happened?

1019
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:44,173
It's been kind of nice
having you here.

1020
01:14:44,808 --> 01:14:50,005
Right? - It's been okay.
- Just okay? - Okay, okay...

1021
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,877
Been very nice having you here,
uncle Maximo. - Now we're talking.

1022
01:14:54,994 --> 01:14:56,628
Bye. - See you,
uncle Maximo.

1023
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:59,875
Don't sprinkle the toilet.
- I'll do my best.

1024
01:15:07,074 --> 01:15:08,828
God!

1025
01:15:10,675 --> 01:15:11,667
Now what?

1026
01:15:20,442 --> 01:15:22,502
Hey. Guys!

1027
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:24,519
I was just looking for you.

1028
01:15:25,476 --> 01:15:27,618
Coffee?
- Coffee.

1029
01:15:28,775 --> 01:15:30,769
Money! - We're not
here for coffee, man!

1030
01:15:30,807 --> 01:15:33,568
Money!
- That's what we want!

1031
01:15:33,607 --> 01:15:37,535
That's why we are here! We don't
even like coffee! - Get the money!

1032
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:41,079
Yeah. Money.
I don't exactly have it.

1033
01:15:41,342 --> 01:15:43,240
What do you mean, exactly?

1034
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:46,295
Means he doesn't have it.

1035
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:48,499
Well, then why don't
just say you don't have it.

1036
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:50,764
Why even say
the word exactly at all?

1037
01:15:51,574 --> 01:15:54,468
I'm gonna pay you, I promise.
- Hey, you got a real nice place here.

1038
01:15:54,506 --> 01:15:57,797
By nice place, I mean a total dump.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1039
01:15:57,839 --> 01:15:59,801
People just say what
they mean, it's confusing.

1040
01:15:59,806 --> 01:16:04,126
Guys, this is my sister's place, please.
- You know what your problem is?

1041
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,342
You don't have any
respect for money man!

1042
01:16:06,572 --> 01:16:09,198
Money doesn't grow on trees.
- No, it doesn't.

1043
01:16:09,233 --> 01:16:12,500
It would be cool if it did.
- Nikki, Nikki! Please!

1044
01:16:12,535 --> 01:16:15,789
I'm just backing up your point.
You could literally rake it up.

1045
01:16:15,824 --> 01:16:18,501
What're you doing? - Hey...
- Totally forgot what I was talking about.

1046
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:21,508
What if we took stuff of yours, sir?
- Okay, okay. That's a good point.

1047
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:23,890
What if we barged in and
started taking stuff?

1048
01:16:23,972 --> 01:16:27,066
What if I took this thing? - No, please...
- I don't even know what it is.

1049
01:16:27,107 --> 01:16:29,335
What about this? What
if I took this? - No, no!

1050
01:16:29,374 --> 01:16:32,789
No, no, not that! That's
my nephew's. That's important.

1051
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:35,649
This is important to you? - Yeah.
- Then, probably don't want me to have it then?

1052
01:16:36,405 --> 01:16:37,600
Hey, no,
don't do that please.

1053
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,824
No, don't do that please.
Okay, okay...

1054
01:16:40,475 --> 01:16:43,179
What do you like?
Sports cars? Helicopters?

1055
01:16:43,341 --> 01:16:47,357
Rolex watches? I promise I am good
for the money and so much more.

1056
01:16:47,472 --> 01:16:49,303
I don't need a Rolex, bro.

1057
01:16:49,573 --> 01:16:51,382
You know something?
- What?

1058
01:16:56,339 --> 01:16:59,315
You seem like a very
sincere guy. - I am.

1059
01:17:00,005 --> 01:17:02,873
But, I don't believe anything
that you say you're gonna do.

1060
01:17:02,938 --> 01:17:05,388
So give us our money,
you can have your camera back.

1061
01:17:05,506 --> 01:17:06,869
It's that simple.

1062
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,733
Hey, please,
please, please. Hey.

1063
01:17:09,738 --> 01:17:13,158
Hey! Have a real nice day.

1064
01:17:13,193 --> 01:17:17,235
And by that I mean,
do not have a real nice day.

1065
01:17:20,838 --> 01:17:25,209
I get it. Sometimes its funny to
not say exactly what you mean.

1066
01:17:25,244 --> 01:17:27,219
Not the camera,
hey, the camera.

1067
01:17:36,907 --> 01:17:39,868
<i>Uncle Maximo, we're home.
Are you ready?</i>

1068
01:17:43,504 --> 01:17:44,497
Almost.

1069
01:18:04,871 --> 01:18:09,718
Wow! We look the same.
- Yep. Maximo. Minimo.

1070
01:18:12,072 --> 01:18:15,009
Wow, mom!
You look pretty.

1071
01:18:15,075 --> 01:18:19,566
<i>And you're so guapo.</i>
- That dress is really tight on you.

1072
01:18:19,602 --> 01:18:23,202
You mean, I look fat? - No,
no, no. In a good way, I mean.

1073
01:18:23,237 --> 01:18:25,899
Because you can see all the
body parts in your body.

1074
01:18:25,971 --> 01:18:28,666
I'm gonna take...
- No! No, no, no.

1075
01:18:28,707 --> 01:18:31,898
Let's make some
magic happen. - Yeah!

1076
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:35,047
Arden, here we come.

1077
01:18:46,056 --> 01:18:48,314
<font color=#00FF00><b>Valet Parking
Please Pull Forward</b></font>

1078
01:19:23,671 --> 01:19:26,498
Wow! Look at this place!

1079
01:19:26,537 --> 01:19:29,997
Yep.
This will do just fine.

1080
01:19:34,971 --> 01:19:36,466
There she is.

1081
01:19:38,438 --> 01:19:42,529
Yep.
There she is.

1082
01:19:44,339 --> 01:19:48,696
Hey, Hugo, just remember
everything I taught you, okay?

1083
01:19:48,803 --> 01:19:50,753
Thank you, uncle Maximo.

1084
01:19:57,705 --> 01:20:00,729
Go get her. Go get her,
Latino lover.

1085
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,129
Beautiful as your uncle.

1086
01:20:26,504 --> 01:20:29,033
Hello.

1087
01:20:29,069 --> 01:20:32,371
Have we met?
- Only in my dreams.

1088
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:38,998
Oh, Hugo!

1089
01:20:42,102 --> 01:20:46,592
Did you hurt your leg?
- No baby, I was just walking.

1090
01:20:47,904 --> 01:20:51,497
My nephew is quiet fond
of your grand daughter.

1091
01:20:51,503 --> 01:20:52,939
Really?

1092
01:20:59,668 --> 01:21:02,098
Do I have something on my face?

1093
01:21:02,133 --> 01:21:05,205
Yes. You have my full attention.

1094
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:08,276
Okay.
- It's enchanting to meet you.

1095
01:21:08,637 --> 01:21:10,119
Maximo.

1096
01:21:11,934 --> 01:21:16,263
Hey baby, what do you say
we like, leave this place.

1097
01:21:16,298 --> 01:21:18,771
What do you mean?
I have a birthday party.

1098
01:21:18,806 --> 01:21:21,259
Drink?
- Allow me, please.

1099
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:25,369
Excuse me... - The lady and I
will have your finest champagne.

1100
01:21:25,404 --> 01:21:27,539
She'll have a Sprite
and I'll have a Coke.

1101
01:21:27,574 --> 01:21:31,205
Something as refreshing
and exciting as she is.

1102
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,829
Of course.
- Well...

1103
01:21:33,864 --> 01:21:36,206
Actually, I'll just have
some water. Thanks.

1104
01:21:36,241 --> 01:21:39,568
Women. They never know
what they want. Am I right?

1105
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:42,306
She'll have a Sprite,
like I said. - But, of course.

1106
01:21:43,601 --> 01:21:45,212
I have to go.

1107
01:21:48,668 --> 01:21:52,062
Arden, wait.
- Shall we grab a bite?

1108
01:21:53,869 --> 01:21:55,718
Wait, wait.

1109
01:21:57,969 --> 01:22:00,176
Sorry I was acting so weird.

1110
01:22:01,436 --> 01:22:05,561
Can we start over?
- Is that a planetary watch?

1111
01:22:06,537 --> 01:22:07,874
Yeah.

1112
01:22:11,036 --> 01:22:14,590
Wanna check out the rest
of my party? - Sure.  - Come on.

1113
01:22:18,103 --> 01:22:19,429
Cheers.

1114
01:22:20,836 --> 01:22:23,422
Beautiful party.
- Isn't it?

1115
01:22:23,536 --> 01:22:26,398
Yeah.
- Such a beautiful day.

1116
01:22:26,434 --> 01:22:28,353
Mountains, trains, chickens.

1117
01:22:29,967 --> 01:22:32,916
That's quiet
a mountain of melon balls.

1118
01:22:32,951 --> 01:22:36,381
You know, climbing is
one of my greatest passions.

1119
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,613
In fact,
I'm training for Everest.

1120
01:22:38,648 --> 01:22:41,813
Of course, it's not the
mountain that we conquer,

1121
01:22:42,702 --> 01:22:44,964
but ourselves.
- Sir Edmund Hilary.

1122
01:22:44,999 --> 01:22:47,039
Yes. You climb?

1123
01:22:47,074 --> 01:22:50,062
Once upon a time. But,
not anymore. - Nonsense.

1124
01:22:50,468 --> 01:22:55,223
Beautiful strong woman like yourself
surely has many climbs left in her.

1125
01:22:55,501 --> 01:22:59,168
Not this woman, I'm afraid.
- Give me one good reason.

1126
01:23:01,002 --> 01:23:02,273
Frost bite.

1127
01:23:02,336 --> 01:23:06,209
South face of Everest. Just thinking
about it gives me day tremors.

1128
01:23:06,402 --> 01:23:07,852
I hate climbing.

1129
01:23:09,602 --> 01:23:12,688
You convince me.
I hate it too.

1130
01:23:13,902 --> 01:23:16,700
What I really love,
train travel.

1131
01:23:16,968 --> 01:23:19,703
So classic.
Won't you agree?

1132
01:23:21,902 --> 01:23:24,983
Steam locomotive, 1950.
- You have no arms?

1133
01:23:25,018 --> 01:23:26,906
I was playing on the tracks
and got stuck.

1134
01:23:26,936 --> 01:23:29,934
I'm afraid I haven't much
fondness for trains.

1135
01:23:30,436 --> 01:23:32,495
Now if you'll excuse me
for a moment, please.

1136
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:34,308
Chicken!

1137
01:23:37,101 --> 01:23:40,627
Chicken? - Yes, Chicken!
I'm sure you love fried chicken.

1138
01:23:40,667 --> 01:23:42,986
Having my limbs
torn from my body,

1139
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:48,286
helped me to realize just how barbaric
the treatment of chickens is in our country.

1140
01:23:48,321 --> 01:23:50,128
I'm vegetarian.
- Which is why I founded

1141
01:23:50,434 --> 01:23:53,243
The Birch Poultry
Rehabilitation Center.

1142
01:23:53,968 --> 01:23:57,042
Now, if you'll forgive
me a moment, please.

1143
01:24:02,933 --> 01:24:04,361
Hey, hey, hey!

1144
01:24:11,034 --> 01:24:12,494
Chicken.

1145
01:24:22,701 --> 01:24:23,695
Rick?

1146
01:24:27,735 --> 01:24:31,561
Rick. Hey! What are
you doing here?  - I was just...

1147
01:24:31,601 --> 01:24:34,593
Waiting for me to make a fool
of myself in front of Celeste?

1148
01:24:36,835 --> 01:24:40,137
Yes. - All that information
that you gave me was wrong.

1149
01:24:40,434 --> 01:24:43,098
It was.
- How could you do that to me?

1150
01:24:43,133 --> 01:24:45,496
Because, I can't take another
second of Millicent.

1151
01:24:45,531 --> 01:24:48,014
Last night, she made me
dress up as her father.

1152
01:24:48,564 --> 01:24:51,506
What is that about?
- I think it's pretty clear.

1153
01:24:51,732 --> 01:24:54,066
I guess you're right.
- So, leave her.

1154
01:24:54,102 --> 01:24:57,255
Leave her? And end up like you
with nothing?

1155
01:24:58,001 --> 01:25:01,841
Look, it's survival of the fittest.
Come on, bro, you know the game.

1156
01:25:02,566 --> 01:25:03,826
No hard feelings.

1157
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:08,566
Hey, Rick...
Hey, Rick... where you going?

1158
01:25:09,634 --> 01:25:10,695
Rick...

1159
01:25:18,667 --> 01:25:21,330
I believe they're playing
our song. May I?

1160
01:25:21,801 --> 01:25:25,068
I'm sorry, do I know you?
- I'm Rick Parsons.

1161
01:25:25,103 --> 01:25:26,189
Hi.
- May I cut in?

1162
01:25:26,224 --> 01:25:28,295
No, I don't think that's a
good idea. - I saw her first.

1163
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:31,893
Well, I was aware of her first.
- I don't care. - Let it go!

1164
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:41,362
You can't...

1165
01:25:44,469 --> 01:25:45,730
How do I...

1166
01:25:48,464 --> 01:25:49,525
Sorry.

1167
01:25:50,967 --> 01:25:54,960
Sorry. - My liege...
- Get out! - Yes.

1168
01:25:57,732 --> 01:25:59,694
You pulled her arm?
- No, you pulled her arm.

1169
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:08,324
You were my best friend.

1170
01:26:08,965 --> 01:26:10,581
Get off me!

1171
01:26:26,067 --> 01:26:27,426
They're fighting.

1172
01:26:32,633 --> 01:26:33,927
Hey, guys,

1173
01:26:35,031 --> 01:26:38,825
it's a kid's birthday party...
- You betrayed me.

1174
01:26:38,866 --> 01:26:42,269
It was just business.
It wasn't personal.

1175
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:49,085
You knew how much I needed this.
- You knew how desperate I was.

1176
01:26:49,098 --> 01:26:51,061
Celeste was my way out.

1177
01:26:51,096 --> 01:26:53,329
You think I'll spend the rest
of my life

1178
01:26:53,365 --> 01:26:56,591
living with my sister and nephew
in their crappy little apartment?

1179
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:59,854
I thought you said
you liked living with us.

1180
01:27:00,965 --> 01:27:02,830
Hugo, no...

1181
01:27:02,998 --> 01:27:05,245
No, I mean... yes.

1182
01:27:05,632 --> 01:27:07,720
I do. I do very much.

1183
01:27:08,631 --> 01:27:11,871
So you were using me to get
Arden's grand mother. Right?

1184
01:27:11,906 --> 01:27:14,575
No, no, no, I was helping you.
- Please don't lie.  - I swear...

1185
01:27:14,632 --> 01:27:18,912
Okay... a little bit. I mean,
I sort of used you.

1186
01:27:18,947 --> 01:27:21,839
But, it wasn't really about you.
It was more about me

1187
01:27:22,398 --> 01:27:25,607
and in order to help me
I wanted to help you.

1188
01:27:26,599 --> 01:27:28,534
My God, I...

1189
01:27:28,569 --> 01:27:32,081
You know, that sounds
worse than it is.

1190
01:27:32,116 --> 01:27:35,571
I thought you were
helping me because you liked me.

1191
01:27:35,606 --> 01:27:38,745
Sorry, I'm sorry. - I don't want
you sleeping in my bed anymore.

1192
01:27:39,566 --> 01:27:42,242
I don't want you to stay
in my house anymore.

1193
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:46,760
Oh, my God.

1194
01:27:52,665 --> 01:27:55,410
Overdressed?
- Absolutely not. No.

1195
01:27:55,698 --> 01:27:58,308
I think everybody at
the game is underdressed.

1196
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:00,958
I think you really
classed the whole place up.

1197
01:28:00,999 --> 01:28:03,696
They should've paid you
to come to the game.

1198
01:28:04,831 --> 01:28:07,144
I'm sorry. It's my son.

1199
01:28:07,996 --> 01:28:09,176
Hi, sweetie.

1200
01:28:11,665 --> 01:28:12,725
What?

1201
01:28:21,267 --> 01:28:24,338
Sorry, I forgot the code.
Is Hugo here?

1202
01:28:25,229 --> 01:28:28,324
Thanks to god, no thanks to you.
- Can I speak with him?

1203
01:28:28,398 --> 01:28:31,869
No. - Please?
Just let me explain.

1204
01:28:32,026 --> 01:28:35,158
How do you explain to a child
who opened his heart to you

1205
01:28:35,193 --> 01:28:36,564
that you were only using him

1206
01:28:36,599 --> 01:28:39,386
to seduce the grandmother
of the girl he likes?

1207
01:28:39,575 --> 01:28:42,705
I can't believe that I was
stupid enough

1208
01:28:43,036 --> 01:28:46,100
to let you humiliate him
like that. - I'm sorry, okay?

1209
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:49,739
Where is Hugo's camera?

1210
01:28:54,088 --> 01:28:56,021
I promise I'll get it back to you.

1211
01:28:56,966 --> 01:29:00,528
So, you were the one who
stole it. - No, I didn't steal it.

1212
01:29:01,032 --> 01:29:05,014
No, Sara, hey!
Don't kick me out, look...

1213
01:29:05,557 --> 01:29:09,356
We're family!
- No. You're not family.

1214
01:29:09,769 --> 01:29:13,269
You're nothing more than
a lazy 46 year old freeloader

1215
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:17,188
who doesn't think of anyone but
himself. You didn't just steal his camera.

1216
01:29:17,276 --> 01:29:20,076
You stole his hopes.
You stole his dreams.

1217
01:29:20,487 --> 01:29:22,054
But it ends now.

1218
01:29:23,532 --> 01:29:26,287
You will never use me
or Hugo again, understood?

1219
01:29:29,704 --> 01:29:31,936
I'm 39.
- What?

1220
01:29:32,123 --> 01:29:34,995
You said I'm 46, but I'm 39.

1221
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:38,196
No, you're not. - Of course, I am.
- No, you're not. - I am.

1222
01:29:38,378 --> 01:29:42,238
But I'm 42. - So what?
- You're my older brother!

1223
01:29:43,217 --> 01:29:44,917
I don't know what to tell you.

1224
01:29:48,346 --> 01:29:49,909
You know what?

1225
01:29:50,806 --> 01:29:52,966
I hope you grow up one day.

1226
01:29:53,809 --> 01:29:55,765
But it won't be in my house.

1227
01:29:58,439 --> 01:30:00,067
Okay, I'm 40.

1228
01:30:01,358 --> 01:30:03,069
Okay, 41.

1229
01:30:03,985 --> 01:30:05,670
We're twins!

1230
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,625
Okay?

1231
01:30:37,631 --> 01:30:40,503
You don't have to sing,
please. - Say your name.

1232
01:30:42,363 --> 01:30:43,625
Say your name.

1233
01:30:44,961 --> 01:30:46,512
Maximo.

1234
01:30:51,595 --> 01:30:55,017
Cindy's home.
- Thank for letting me stay.

1235
01:30:58,861 --> 01:31:00,062
Watch your back.

1236
01:31:03,730 --> 01:31:06,432
We got you some
nice hot tea.

1237
01:31:06,467 --> 01:31:07,825
I think I got all the hairs out.

1238
01:31:07,864 --> 01:31:10,768
And you can stay here
as long as you like.

1239
01:31:11,995 --> 01:31:14,703
I'm sure you'll figure out
a way to pay me back.

1240
01:31:17,994 --> 01:31:19,488
I get it.

1241
01:31:30,462 --> 01:31:33,290
Eye contact.
Don't lose eye contact.

1242
01:31:38,961 --> 01:31:42,142
What are you doing? - I'm
about to pay you back. - What?

1243
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:44,454
God!

1244
01:31:46,696 --> 01:31:48,992
No, no, stop, stop.
Please stop.

1245
01:31:49,531 --> 01:31:51,274
Isn't this what
you want? - No.

1246
01:31:51,562 --> 01:31:55,930
God, no. Button up,
just put that away.

1247
01:31:56,361 --> 01:31:59,779
You're not attracted
to me? - No.  - Really?

1248
01:31:59,829 --> 01:32:01,083
Not at all.

1249
01:32:01,329 --> 01:32:05,405
No, I'm attracted to like
really good looking guys.

1250
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,920
Guys with like great faces,

1251
01:32:07,926 --> 01:32:10,956
great bodies, who are muscular,

1252
01:32:10,996 --> 01:32:14,124
handsome and younger,
much younger than you.

1253
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:17,704
And tall, a lot taller.
But, that's just me.

1254
01:32:18,428 --> 01:32:21,144
Then, why did you
give me the job?

1255
01:32:22,729 --> 01:32:24,824
I think I'm just drawn
to helping

1256
01:32:25,629 --> 01:32:27,935
less fortunate, damaged,

1257
01:32:28,095 --> 01:32:33,031
sad, sad, sad, sad creatures.

1258
01:32:33,795 --> 01:32:35,857
Why do you think
I have so many cats?

1259
01:32:36,528 --> 01:32:38,755
They need me,
but I need them.

1260
01:32:40,365 --> 01:32:42,334
But, they hurt you
over and over again.

1261
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:45,870
This guy, right? I know.

1262
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:50,373
I mean, just because they hurt me
doesn't mean they don't love me.

1263
01:32:51,429 --> 01:32:53,199
I take care of them

1264
01:32:53,762 --> 01:32:56,072
and I don't expect
anything in return.

1265
01:32:57,395 --> 01:32:59,058
These cats are my family.

1266
01:33:00,927 --> 01:33:03,444
I had a chance to be
part of a family.

1267
01:33:04,694 --> 01:33:06,333
I ruined it.

1268
01:33:08,761 --> 01:33:10,821
I don't think you ruined it.

1269
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:14,399
Because, it's never too late
to make it right.

1270
01:33:16,629 --> 01:33:18,928
You've cat to do
what you cat to do.

1271
01:33:22,328 --> 01:33:24,568
I've never seen
that one before.

1272
01:33:25,362 --> 01:33:28,623
Well, you'd be happy to know
that I lost everything.

1273
01:33:30,028 --> 01:33:33,495
Millicent found out about Celeste's
party, she kicked me out.

1274
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:37,202
You got a sister you
can stay with? - No.

1275
01:33:41,726 --> 01:33:44,038
I never should have gone
behind your back like that.

1276
01:33:45,395 --> 01:33:47,452
Wish there was something
I could do to make it up to you.

1277
01:33:48,695 --> 01:33:50,268
There is something.

1278
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:54,892
That's your idea face.
- Yep.

1279
01:33:56,026 --> 01:33:57,449
This is it.

1280
01:33:58,996 --> 01:34:02,152
So, when's the kid's science
fair again? - It's in three hours.

1281
01:34:02,894 --> 01:34:05,299
You get in there and get the camera.
I'll keep them distracted over here.

1282
01:34:06,661 --> 01:34:08,994
Police.

1283
01:34:10,362 --> 01:34:11,677
Police from the neighborhood.

1284
01:34:15,561 --> 01:34:18,246
Can I help you, officer?
Here for the tiny motorcycle?

1285
01:34:18,281 --> 01:34:19,822
He's not here
for your stupid bike.

1286
01:34:20,528 --> 01:34:21,766
You here for the bike?

1287
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:24,684
No sir, I'm not here for the vehicle.
There's a neighborhood gas leak,

1288
01:34:25,661 --> 01:34:27,845
evacuate the premises.

1289
01:34:28,328 --> 01:34:30,957
Gas leak? I didn't even know
we had gas.

1290
01:34:31,093 --> 01:34:32,989
Situation is clear, Larry.

1291
01:34:33,428 --> 01:34:36,037
Yes, sir, Mr. Neighborhood
Police Officer.

1292
01:34:36,062 --> 01:34:39,318
I'm gonna fix the... I'm closing
the door because the gas is...

1293
01:34:39,528 --> 01:34:43,469
leaking here. - I didn't smell
any gas.  - I don't smell anything.

1294
01:34:43,494 --> 01:34:46,693
You wouldn't. That's what makes
the danger so dangerous.

1295
01:34:51,627 --> 01:34:54,782
Excuse me, officer?
-What kind of handcuffs are those?

1296
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:59,320
Police handcuffs.
- Are they furry?

1297
01:35:02,593 --> 01:35:04,977
There had been some local perps,

1298
01:35:05,012 --> 01:35:07,536
who have been having an
allergic reaction to the metal.

1299
01:35:10,528 --> 01:35:12,744
Now, we coat it
in synthetic material,

1300
01:35:12,959 --> 01:35:16,430
health is on the uprise,
crime is on the down rise.

1301
01:35:16,827 --> 01:35:19,376
But, I wouldn't worry your
pretty head over that, ma'am.

1302
01:35:19,411 --> 01:35:21,487
I don't think we need it in
this investigation. - Ma'am?  - Ma'am?

1303
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:27,027
Is this an investigation?
I thought this was a gas leak?

1304
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:30,407
Investigation of a gas leak.

1305
01:35:30,442 --> 01:35:35,272
And shut up! I'm a police officer,
I want this crime scene secured.

1306
01:35:35,327 --> 01:35:38,440
It's not a crime scene...
- Shut up!

1307
01:35:44,658 --> 01:35:46,086
Got you!

1308
01:35:51,327 --> 01:35:54,240
Take it easy, alright. You said
investigation - No! You take it easy.

1309
01:35:54,457 --> 01:35:57,370
Or I'll shoot you!
- You're not shooting anybody.

1310
01:35:57,405 --> 01:35:59,691
I'll shoot you in the Lorax!

1311
01:35:59,726 --> 01:36:01,676
That's not a thing, officer.
- It's a children's book.

1312
01:36:01,759 --> 01:36:04,669
You sussing me boy?
You sussing me?

1313
01:36:04,704 --> 01:36:07,620
I am a police officer
of the law.

1314
01:36:07,793 --> 01:36:09,102
I don't think you are.

1315
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:14,563
Officer George Clooney
from the 69th precinct.

1316
01:36:15,526 --> 01:36:18,169
Don't make me use this.
- I won't.

1317
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:22,211
Let it go.
- We've been compromised!

1318
01:36:23,592 --> 01:36:25,245
Ride like the wind.

1319
01:36:34,058 --> 01:36:36,222
Hey, sloucher jerk!

1320
01:36:38,726 --> 01:36:41,404
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1321
01:36:41,827 --> 01:36:43,340
You have the right
to remain silent.

1322
01:36:44,825 --> 01:36:45,922
Not in the face.

1323
01:36:56,358 --> 01:36:57,553
Hugo.

1324
01:36:59,659 --> 01:37:02,884
Hugo.
Hey, Hugo.

1325
01:37:03,492 --> 01:37:07,486
Hugo.
Hugo. Hey!

1326
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:09,526
Here's Hugo's camera.

1327
01:37:09,541 --> 01:37:12,851
If we go now, we can still
make the science fair!

1328
01:37:12,877 --> 01:37:15,524
The fair was yesterday.
Hugo missed it.

1329
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:18,254
No! He told me Sunday at 1!

1330
01:37:18,289 --> 01:37:20,424
Today is Monday.
You're too late.

1331
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:26,139
No, it's never too late!
- This time it is.

1332
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:28,232
24 hours late to be exact.

1333
01:37:29,017 --> 01:37:30,986
Thanks for the camera.

1334
01:38:36,023 --> 01:38:38,429
All I wanted to do
was impress her.

1335
01:38:38,923 --> 01:38:44,060
Instead, I was humiliated.
- I am sorry, honey.

1336
01:38:45,391 --> 01:38:48,399
You want me to
walk you in? - No, I don't.

1337
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:54,624
You can't live your life afraid
something bad will happen,

1338
01:38:55,792 --> 01:38:58,193
because then, you've
really never lived.

1339
01:38:59,825 --> 01:39:03,358
Where did you hear that?
- Uncle Maximo.

1340
01:39:13,424 --> 01:39:15,967
Hi, Arden.
- Hugo.

1341
01:39:16,657 --> 01:39:18,413
I'm so glad to see you.

1342
01:39:18,892 --> 01:39:22,659
You are? - Yeah.
- I thought you were mad at me.

1343
01:39:22,823 --> 01:39:25,915
No. My grandma and I know
you did nothing wrong.

1344
01:39:28,023 --> 01:39:28,720
Good.

1345
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:31,317
I was worried that
your grandma would be

1346
01:39:31,690 --> 01:39:33,674
up in arms about
us being friends.

1347
01:39:35,758 --> 01:39:39,684
Get it? Up in arms.
Up in arms. Get it?

1348
01:39:39,725 --> 01:39:40,702
Hugo, that's not funny.

1349
01:39:42,057 --> 01:39:43,433
That's just offensive.

1350
01:39:45,490 --> 01:39:48,945
I didn't mean it like that.
- I'm joking.

1351
01:39:49,425 --> 01:39:52,218
I'm funny too, you know.
- Wow, you are funny!

1352
01:39:55,056 --> 01:39:57,060
I got your letter.
- My letter?

1353
01:39:57,489 --> 01:40:01,191
No one's ever written me an
actual on real paper before.

1354
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:05,077
Really?
- And my answer is yes.

1355
01:40:05,925 --> 01:40:09,844
Well, that's great!

1356
01:40:10,622 --> 01:40:12,356
To what question again,
I'm sorry...

1357
01:40:12,723 --> 01:40:15,171
I'd love to launch the weather
balloon with you, silly.

1358
01:40:15,857 --> 01:40:18,358
Yeah, right,
my weather balloon.

1359
01:40:18,857 --> 01:40:21,535
I forgot about that.
How could I forget about that.

1360
01:40:23,554 --> 01:40:24,735
Can I see that for a sec.

1361
01:40:24,955 --> 01:40:27,596
I just want to see if I got
all my punctuations right.

1362
01:40:27,923 --> 01:40:31,374
Is that okay. - As long as
you give it back. - Thank you.

1363
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:38,549
<i>"Dearest Arden,</i>

1364
01:40:38,589 --> 01:40:40,417
<i>I am sorry if I caused
you any pain.</i>

1365
01:40:40,890 --> 01:40:43,023
<i>It was the last thing
I wanted to do.</i>

1366
01:40:46,657 --> 01:40:48,818
<i>You are more important
to me than you know.</i>

1367
01:40:49,588 --> 01:40:52,163
Two, one... Yes go!

1368
01:40:52,623 --> 01:40:55,554
<i>I always wished we could
be friends.</i> - There it goes.

1369
01:40:58,456 --> 01:41:00,561
<i>But, you don't get what
you wish for,</i>

1370
01:41:01,854 --> 01:41:03,593
<i>you get what you work for.</i>

1371
01:41:09,755 --> 01:41:11,921
<i>Sometimes love can be scary.</i>

1372
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:18,755
Alright, moment of truth,
here we go.

1373
01:41:21,556 --> 01:41:22,549
I think...

1374
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:36,028
<i>Sometimes love
can be surprising.</i>

1375
01:41:44,956 --> 01:41:47,115
Is this happening?
- I think so.

1376
01:41:55,921 --> 01:41:58,524
<i>Sometimes we hurt
the ones we love.</i>

1377
01:42:08,088 --> 01:42:11,851
No! - What the hell is
that?  - I didn't know man.

1378
01:42:15,522 --> 01:42:18,533
<i>But, it's never too late
to make it right.</i>

1379
01:42:37,622 --> 01:42:39,997
<i>Our time on earth is short.</i>

1380
01:42:45,921 --> 01:42:48,127
<i>But, love is forever.</i>

1381
01:42:50,487 --> 01:42:52,860
<i>You make me want to
be a better fifth grader.</i>

1382
01:42:55,822 --> 01:42:58,564
<i>Would you please join me in
launching my weather balloon?</i>

1383
01:42:59,554 --> 01:43:01,373
<i>Yours, Hugo."</i>

1384
01:43:05,855 --> 01:43:09,449
Oh, Sara. - You didn't
get the house in Pasadena,

1385
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:11,871
they went with someone...
- Let me guess, more experienced.

1386
01:43:12,789 --> 01:43:14,279
Yeah. - Well, you
know what I think?

1387
01:43:14,454 --> 01:43:16,051
Good...
- Can I finish?

1388
01:43:17,322 --> 01:43:19,745
I think that I deserve
a shot at my own house.

1389
01:43:20,021 --> 01:43:21,494
And if I'm not given my due,

1390
01:43:21,922 --> 01:43:24,628
I not afraid to go somewhere
else where I am appreciated.

1391
01:43:25,721 --> 01:43:29,101
Okay. Have you finished?
- No, I am not.

1392
01:43:29,756 --> 01:43:31,741
A lesser woman would
have given up already,

1393
01:43:31,988 --> 01:43:33,717
ten years of drawing plans.

1394
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:36,053
But, I am strong,
I am determined.

1395
01:43:36,389 --> 01:43:38,846
And I know that I will find
my dream job someday.

1396
01:43:38,952 --> 01:43:41,886
Yes, you will. - Yes, I will.
- And that day is today.

1397
01:43:45,089 --> 01:43:46,383
What?

1398
01:43:53,486 --> 01:43:55,047
Okay, Hugo.

1399
01:43:55,087 --> 01:43:57,072
What do you think?
Glasses on or glasses off?

1400
01:43:57,722 --> 01:43:59,403
You look pretty
either way, mommy.

1401
01:43:59,688 --> 01:44:02,355
Baby,
it's a big day today.

1402
01:44:03,056 --> 01:44:05,237
Mommy's a little nervous.

1403
01:44:05,587 --> 01:44:08,919
Well, at least your nose isn't
sweating. - Well, it's a good thing.

1404
01:44:11,721 --> 01:44:14,870
Wow!
A helicopter!

1405
01:44:15,721 --> 01:44:17,996
Oh my Goodness!
Okay...

1406
01:44:19,822 --> 01:44:23,676
You wait here and
I will be... right back.

1407
01:44:23,787 --> 01:44:25,611
Mommy...
- Yeah?

1408
01:44:26,987 --> 01:44:28,299
I am proud of you.

1409
01:44:39,019 --> 01:44:41,382
Mommy's gonna
build a house. - Yes!

1410
01:44:54,887 --> 01:45:00,290
Mrs. Dupont. It is
so nice to meet you.

1411
01:45:00,325 --> 01:45:00,347
Thank you. Thank you
for this opportunity

1412
01:45:00,385 --> 01:45:02,204
I promise that you
wont regret it.

1413
01:45:02,485 --> 01:45:06,148
I certainly hope not. You
come very highly recommended.

1414
01:45:08,387 --> 01:45:09,349
By who?

1415
01:45:13,385 --> 01:45:15,869
Maximo?
- Wow!

1416
01:45:22,325 --> 01:45:25,502
You didn't think I'd be selling
frozen yogurt all my life, did you?

1417
01:45:27,419 --> 01:45:31,651
I usually don't put much stock
in what my man candy says, but

1418
01:45:31,822 --> 01:45:35,066
he showed me your
designs and I loved them.

1419
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:36,754
You did?

1420
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:42,906
Thank you.
- Uncle Maximo.

1421
01:45:43,384 --> 01:45:45,641
Uncle Maximo.
- Hey!

1422
01:45:46,819 --> 01:45:50,265
Hugo! - That's my son.
- I missed you so much.

1423
01:45:50,485 --> 01:45:51,603
Missed you too.

1424
01:45:52,785 --> 01:45:54,617
Nice blazer, Uncle Maximo.

1425
01:45:55,552 --> 01:45:57,898
Professor Rojas,
when she's around.

1426
01:45:58,487 --> 01:46:00,076
Such a great view.

1427
01:46:00,652 --> 01:46:03,284
I'm so glad I am rich.
- Yeah, me too.

1428
01:46:03,318 --> 01:46:07,350
Must be nice.
- Hey, don't go too far.

1429
01:46:07,619 --> 01:46:09,037
Or I'll put you in detention.

1430
01:46:09,818 --> 01:46:11,780
Have I been a bad girl?

1431
01:46:20,352 --> 01:46:22,286
Well, I guess Papa was wrong.

1432
01:46:23,053 --> 01:46:26,369
Sometimes you do get what
you wish for. - Are you kidding?

1433
01:46:26,549 --> 01:46:30,418
This woman's a lot of work.
- <i>Ay dios mio.</i>

1434
01:46:30,453 --> 01:46:32,108
Hugo, wanna go for a ride?

1435
01:46:32,144 --> 01:46:35,420
I don't know if momma
will let me. - You know what?

1436
01:46:35,982 --> 01:46:40,466
I think professor Rojas
has earned another chance.

1437
01:46:40,585 --> 01:46:44,025
Yes!
- That's my older sister.

1438
01:46:44,586 --> 01:46:47,104
Stop it! I am
your baby sister!

1439
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:50,585
Yeah, but you look older.
Honestly.

1440
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:54,286
What can I tell you?
It's true. - Come here, come here.

1441
01:46:54,409 --> 01:46:55,408
Come here.

1442
01:47:00,038 --> 01:47:03,956
Thank you. Thank you! You
helped me make my dream come true.

1443
01:47:07,951 --> 01:47:11,447
You earned it.
You're so talented.

1444
01:47:12,592 --> 01:47:13,722
I love you.

1445
01:47:16,137 --> 01:47:17,768
I love you.

1446
01:47:20,685 --> 01:47:23,225
Okay, Hugo, let's go.
Mommy's got work to do.

1447
01:47:23,769 --> 01:47:27,022
Don't call him "Jugo."
His name is Hugo!

1448
01:47:27,057 --> 01:47:29,272
Same thing.
- He's not a juice.

1449
01:47:31,619 --> 01:47:34,953
Up you go.
Come on, co pilot.

1450
01:47:34,988 --> 01:47:38,659
I want the house
to be beautiful. - Me too.

1451
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:40,091
But eerie.

1452
01:47:41,751 --> 01:47:44,357
Sleek.
Seaside.

1453
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:46,804
Fever dream.

1454
01:47:50,717 --> 01:47:53,018
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

1455
01:47:56,884 --> 01:47:57,944
Let's fly.

1456
01:48:00,518 --> 01:48:01,511
Bye.

1457
01:48:06,348 --> 01:48:08,610
I didn't know you
could fly a helicopter.

1458
01:48:08,651 --> 01:48:11,709
Of course. All rich
people fly helicopters.

1459
01:48:11,753 --> 01:48:14,180
Can I drive?
- I don't see why not.

1460
01:48:14,450 --> 01:48:15,477
Yes!

1461
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:19,868
No! No!

1462
01:48:21,551 --> 01:48:24,908
I thought we were in
trouble there. - You got it.

1463
01:48:25,552 --> 01:48:29,132
Hello?
- Who's that?

1464
01:48:29,548 --> 01:48:31,753
It's your mommy.
She wants us to come back now.

1465
01:48:36,819 --> 01:48:37,813
Come on.

1466
01:48:40,516 --> 01:48:41,876
Show me your sexy.

1467
01:48:53,050 --> 01:48:54,544
Camera 1...

1468
01:49:09,883 --> 01:49:12,745
Squeeze your body.
You look like Chaplin.

1469
01:49:12,783 --> 01:49:15,443
You know who
Chaplin is? - No.

1470
01:49:28,483 --> 01:49:32,612
Unhand me, sir.

1471
01:49:44,317 --> 01:49:47,145
Do you want me to see if the
manager's here. She does all hiring.

1472
01:49:47,474 --> 01:49:48,620
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1473
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:52,941
Hello. I am the manager.

1474
01:50:11,315 --> 01:50:13,409
Hey, guys.

1475
01:50:16,682 --> 01:50:19,603
Latin lover.
- Latin lover.
