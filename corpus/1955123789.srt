1
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:01,228
We would say,
Ous se trouve les restaurant sais predict?

2
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,856
Ous se trouve les restaurant sais predict?

3
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,569
Very good... And if we wanted to know.

4
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,488
Stretch... and lift.

5
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,327
And greet them. And greet them.

6
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,205
And say hello again.

7
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,787
Come on bay, come over here.

8
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,837
You do your Goddamn job!

9
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,841
You tell that mother fucker he owes me $75
for this and to brush his Goddamn teeth!

10
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,803
Fucking cocksucker.

11
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,143
Avoid guys in baseball caps
because they're broke.

12
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,425
And they spend the entire time
trying to finger-fuck you.

13
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,859
Stupid ass.

14
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,407
What are you covering up?

15
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,828
Oh I just have uhh... these...

16
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,328
spider bites.

17
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,164
You got bite in here?

18
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,499
Let me see.

19
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,919
Where? I don't see anything.

20
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,881
Well they're... it's better now,
they were worse before

21
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,593
- Can you tighten this for me?
- Yeah

22
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,515
Do it tight.

23
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,475
Make it look like I don't
eat bread and shit...

24
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,062
Girl I swear I stopped dancing Vegas

25
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,814
so I wouldn't have to
deal with these bastards.

26
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,896
You know
I danced for a guy tonight in a wheelchair,

27
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,652
said it was his birthday
and he was gonna fuck me in the ass.

28
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,739
I swear to Christ, all men
are the fucking same.

29
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,319
Too bad these mother fuckers don't know
I like pussy.

30
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,702
Stupid ass.

31
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,539
- You not finished?
- Yeah, here ya go.

32
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,083
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

33
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,502
You're new here right?

34
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,544
Yeah.

35
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:16,923
So what's your name?

36
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,549
Venus.

37
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,136
- You're real name, bitch.
- It's Venus.

38
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,638
Oh well I'm Jupitor, nice to meet you.

39
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,932
I'm just fucking with you.

40
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,685
I'm Chanel. Well, Bethany,
but fuck that right?

41
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,730
Ain't nobody trying to buy no dance
from no batch named Bethany.

42
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,151
You must clean up in here?

43
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,944
I do ok.

44
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,780
What's ok?

45
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,866
Like 100 to 200 a night, maybe.

46
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,910
That's fucking ridiculous.

47
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,454
You might as well wait goddamn tables
in this bitch.

48
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,372
No stripper should be hurting for a cash.

49
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,654
Do you know you can make just as much as
an attorney if you play your cards right?

50
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,920
So what's your game?

51
00:04:56,588 --> 00:05:01,218
Ummm, I walk around the room
and if somebody wants a dance then

52
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,805
No, no nah... Stop right there,
I'm gonna help you...

53
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,636
Cause you on that bullshit.

54
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,852
This is a sales job,
you have to know how to work these guys.

55
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,897
Don't talk about their job, or
their family, their little kids,

56
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,066
their boring-ass reality,
don't nobody want to hear that shit.

57
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,068
You have to keep it all in fantasy.

58
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,154
Talk about the new lotion you're wearing,
the new lingerie you just bought,

59
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,739
the hot chick you just made outwith.

60
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,981
Whatever, I don't give a shit.

61
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,868
You just have to be dripping with sex.

62
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,914
Because once you have a man turned on,
that's when you can take all of his money.

63
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,708
Scan the room, find a
guy, lock eyes with him

64
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,211
and stare at him like he's the only fucker
in the goddamn room

65
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,172
and then you empty his fucking wallet.
You got it?

66
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,131
Got it.

67
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Good.

68
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,318
I'm just waiting for the
next song to start.

69
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,029
And then... and then I'll dance for you.

70
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,740
<i>OK.</i>

71
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,788
Do you want to know what I did last week?

72
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,207
What did you do?

73
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,002
I made outwith my friend Sophia.

74
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,712
Really?

75
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:08,386
Yep. And she's a... super model.
From Italy.

76
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,808
And... it was really hot because
I've always wanted to do that.

77
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,730
God you look like my wife.

78
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,984
Oh... Ok.

79
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,570
I'm sorry. That was...
that was a bit weird.

80
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,157
- It's just...
- It's 0k.

81
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:34,287
It's just amazing. You have the same eyes,
the same mouth, the hair.

82
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,165
The only thing different
was she was a blonde.

83
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,420
Oh, are you guys not together anymore?

84
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,465
No. We're not.

85
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,507
Why?

86
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,303
I mean, urn, if it's too personal
it's okay, you don't have to tell me.

87
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,015
It's... it's ok... She died.

88
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,728
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
L... l didn't know.

89
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,564
It's... it's ok. It's ok.
I'm sorry, it's...

90
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,734
I'm obviously not very good at this.

91
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,361
That's 0k.

92
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,114
- Maybe I should just sort of leave...
- No.

93
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,949
- Then come back and start again.
- No.

94
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,117
No?

95
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,578
- No, no don't do that, stay.
- Ok.

96
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,998
Yeah, I like you here, actually.

97
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,591
I was born in New York City.
I love dark chocolate.

98
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,971
And my left foot is half a size
bigger than the right.

99
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,015
Done... Check!

100
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,057
Oh.

101
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,351
I should never have told you.

102
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,233
I know, you should not
have ever have told me.

103
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:47,944
So, why on earth would you leave
an exotic place like Australia?

104
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,947
Exotic? I don't know about that?

105
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,032
Hmm.

106
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,076
Look, I never really planned
on leaving Australia.

107
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,412
I uhh... l got a shoot out here.

108
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,873
I'm a photographer, and uhh... l...

109
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,878
I fell in love, I got
married and, I don't know.

110
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,340
Yeah... So you're a photographer?

111
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,134
Urn hm.

112
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:17,015
Ok, well... Maybe you'd like
to take my picture sometime?

113
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,769
I guess this means
we'd have to see each other again then.

114
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:26,691
Umm, yeah... That sounds like a good idea.

115
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,676
Hi.

116
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,717
Hi.

117
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,179
You look amazing.

118
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,306
Thank you.

119
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,810
I hope you like dark chocolate.

120
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,021
Um, why don't you come in.

121
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,648
Thank you.

122
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,777
Wow, looks like another world in here.

123
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,029
That's the point.

124
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,033
L...made us a cheese plate,

125
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,871
with some strawberries and, um some wine,

126
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:08,376
I, I didn't know...
if may be you wanted some right away,

127
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,796
or... if maybe you wanted some...

128
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,367
So have you had a girlfriend?
Since, ya know...

129
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,541
A few short-lived things.
But nothing really.

130
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,174
Can I ask you what your wife's name was?

131
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,053
It was Victoria.

132
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:50,061
How did... she? I'm sorry I...

133
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,980
No, it's 0k, it's ok.

134
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,693
She killed herself.

135
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,406
What happened?

136
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,201
She uhh...

137
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:13,584
She uhh, she cut her wrists... in the bath.

138
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,797
By the time I got there it was too late.

139
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,425
There was no point in
taking her to the hospital.

140
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,804
She was very depressed.

141
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,934
Ya know she would... she would go to bed
early, she would sleep all the time, ya know?

142
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,937
We wouldn't talk at dinner.

143
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,525
She stopped doing the things
she sort of loved to do.

144
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:44,991
She quit her job and...
and in a way it felt like she quit me...

145
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:53,958
Like I'd come home from work and...
there she'd be... in a white slip,

146
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,377
with a book in her hand,

147
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,755
but not really reading it...

148
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,387
Ya know, so we ya know,
went to a couples therapy they,

149
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,639
they diagonosed her with depression.

150
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,186
And then I got a job offer in Madrid.

151
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:23,071
And I uhh... l cheated on
her, with some intern,

152
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,990
I...can't even remember
the name of her ya know?

153
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,660
When I got back she was dead.

154
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,499
It's not your fault, Brian.

155
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,127
I shouldn't have left her.

156
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,469
Are you scared of loving again?

157
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,350
Not anymore.

158
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,204
Doesn't even know what you fucking said!

159
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,561
Hey.

160
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,938
Hey handsome.

161
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,608
Whoa...

162
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,199
Babe“.

163
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,706
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
wait a second, wait a second...

164
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,879
I'm sorry, I'm just...

165
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,800
I just had a long day, ya know?
I haven't eaten much.

166
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:36,556
Well, what if I make you some of that
fusilli pasta that you like.

167
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:42,644
Babe“.

168
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,526
I think I just gotta go to sleep.

169
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,739
<i>OK.</i>

170
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,715
Hey, it's me. I just got back.

171
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,384
Crazy trip, I have so much to tell you.

172
00:18:55,885 --> 00:19:00,556
Anyway, umm, I've been thinking about you
and I'd love to see you,

173
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,767
so give me a call when you can. Bye.

174
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:17,907
Red is so nice.

175
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,575
Yeah, it's soft too.

176
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,744
It's good quality. It will last you.

177
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,205
Everything in your shop is good quality,
I love coming here.

178
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,230
How long have you been coming here?

179
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,583
Since you've been open.

180
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,879
And you can't stop me... l want these too,
they're very soft.

181
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:38,094
Uhh, don't look now but...
that Venus chick, is here.

182
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,723
You know, I heard she was a ballet dancer

183
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:43,808
In like Paris or something

184
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,559
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and she got kicked out.

185
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,436
I wonder why do you think? Why?

186
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,480
And now she's like a stripper.

187
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,982
Venus cannot be her real name.

188
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,984
She came in here drunk one time.

189
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,695
- In the store?
- In the store.

190
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,113
You should have kicked her out.

191
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,155
It was crazy what was I gonna do?

192
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,000
I can't just kick somebody out of my store.

193
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,877
But that's a really good
gift for your neice.

194
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,131
Yeah, she started journaling and so I,
I want to encourage that, ya know?

195
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,675
I mean, kids these day,
if you can get them writing

196
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,607
Hello.

197
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:06,492
I'm so alone... Lonely.

198
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:15,535
I miss you baby. I miss you so.

199
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:24,043
I miss you baby. I could die.

200
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,007
How is it?

201
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,343
It's great. It's great.

202
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,345
Hmm, good.

203
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,351
I got you something today...

204
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,673
But you have to close your eyes...

205
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,025
Just do it, come on.

206
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:26,989
Ok. Two seconds.

207
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,831
Bri.

208
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:42,880
<i>OK, open.</i>

209
00:23:58,896 --> 00:23:59,896
Do you know what that is?

210
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,275
Uhhh... No.

211
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,569
That's me.

212
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,657
<i>OK.</i>

213
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,244
That's Venus De Milo. She's
the goddess of love...

214
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,123
You know I was named after her.

215
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,587
Thank you. That's nice.

216
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,838
You're welcome.

217
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,312
- Hey, Bri?
- Yeah.

218
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:45,109
I know you said it's bad luck for people
to look at your photos before your show...

219
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,194
but can I please see them?

220
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,780
I don't have them framed yet.

221
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,157
I don't care about frames, it's ok.

222
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,161
<i>OK.</i>

223
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,165
Qk... Cool.

224
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,136
Jesus, they're amazing.

225
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,014
Why do they all have masks?

226
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,851
I don't know. Mascarade theme I guess.

227
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,940
Hmm... this one is stunning.

228
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,068
Thank you. Very proud of that one.

229
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,237
See how she's turning away?

230
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,783
Sort of sad but... l don't know,
inviting at the same time.

231
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,036
Who is she?

232
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:40,748
Uhh, an old friend, Christine.
Known her for years.

233
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,376
Hmm.

234
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,597
Hey, Bri?

235
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,681
Yeah.

236
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,310
How do you know Christine?

237
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:10,903
She was uhh, friends with my wife.
She was her best friend.

238
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,245
What's the matter?

239
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,213
- Does she live around here?
- Yeah.

240
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,468
Ok... What does she do?

241
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,931
She uhh, she owns an antique
store here in town.

242
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,349
Oh.

243
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,908
Did you guys ever hook up?

244
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,543
When Victoria passed away,
we had a short-lived thing.

245
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,254
Ya know, we got close.

246
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,925
Ya know we were both mourning the
same person, it sort of connected us.

247
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,845
But I never loved her.

248
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,391
Ya know, it was just something
that happened a long time ago.

249
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,020
And now we're just friends. I promise.

250
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,436
Hey, Bri?

251
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,147
Yeah.

252
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,986
I want you to photograph me.

253
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,572
<i>OK.</i>

254
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:36,506
What if I turn a little bit?
And face the window?

255
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,674
That's fine.

256
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,514
Something like this.

257
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,396
Let's lose the mask. I uhh...
I don't think it's working on this one.

258
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,607
<i>OK.</i>

259
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,204
We got it.

260
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,165
Really?

261
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,877
That's it. We got the shot.

262
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:15,963
We just started though?

263
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,258
We only need that one shot...
We just got it.

264
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,385
<i>OK.</i>

265
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,080
Do you want to get some sushi?

266
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,583
Uhh... Got a really busy day.

267
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:59,172
Ok, I could umm, come back later,
we could do dinner?

268
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,175
I can make you some pasta and
we can have some red wine?

269
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,930
Umm... Got a lot of meetings
tonight, ya know? Work stuff, so...

270
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:11,268
That's fine, I should probably work...
anyway.

271
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,524
Qu'est ce tu en pense.

272
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:20,943
Bravo.

273
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,530
Now if you wanted to say that
you agree you would say,

274
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,031
Je suis d'accord.

275
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,576
ExceHenL

276
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,038
If you did not agree you would say

277
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,776
- Hey, how are you?
- Christine, hey.

278
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,486
- So good to see you.
- So good to see you too.

279
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,821
Oh, thank you.

280
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,490
Let's get your coat off.

281
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,533
Oh, yeah.

282
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,869
You're looking slick and slender there.

283
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,121
Oh yeah, wow.

284
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:43,845
Get the fuck outta my way.

285
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:44,887
Jesus!

286
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,643
Watch it, bitch!

287
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,906
Fuck off! Mother fucker!

288
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,735
Shit, look at this... What's baby?
Hey, where you going?

289
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,284
Fucking crazy bitch!

290
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:49,952
Fuck.

291
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960
Hello.

292
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,295
Can I come up?

293
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,338
Fine.

294
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,757
Can I come in?

295
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:56,805
Come in.

296
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,524
You wanna sit down?

297
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,359
So, what's up?

298
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,863
I got your note.

299
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,451
Why did you follow me?

300
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,872
Why did you lie to me?

301
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,086
Because you wouldn't have understood,
and I didn't want to fight.

302
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:17,386
Look, Christine has a boyfriend, ok?
And we're just friends.

303
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,769
Look, Venus, this is hard, like...

304
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,563
I really care about you.

305
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,859
I just can't see you anymore.

306
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:39,909
The truth of it is...
I'm just over my wife.

307
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:48,751
I try to be, I do... I'm just not.

308
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,797
I fell for you, Venus, I really did...

309
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,467
but with the way things are...

310
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,139
I need to be alone... Venus?

311
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:15,695
I'm gonna go, ok?

312
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,623
Wait!

313
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,297
Wait.

314
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:50,980
Venus.

315
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,784
Venus, Venus... Venus, Venus...

316
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,210
I can't do this.

317
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,170
<i>OK'?</i>

318
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,384
I'm sorry

319
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,513
I gotta go.

320
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,661
Hey it's Brian here,
uhh, sorry I missed your call.

321
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,038
Leave a message and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

322
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,468
Scotch on the rocks.

323
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:14,285
You're supposed to look at me when you
toast, didn't you ever hear that?

324
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,619
Ahh, sorry, it was burning.

325
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,330
It's bad luck if you don't do that,
so now we're cursed.

326
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,208
I can live with that.

327
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,046
<i>Yeah. OK. Are you sure'?</i>

328
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,172
Urn hm.

329
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,593
So do you think all women are whores?

330
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:32,845
Only the good ones.

331
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,305
What does that mean?

332
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,642
You gotta kiss an angel good morning

333
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,937
and love her like the devil
when you get back home

334
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,484
The devil... the devil, that's good.

335
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,652
- You like the devil?
- That's really good.

336
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,779
I'll bet you do like the devil.

337
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,784
I gotta go to the little girl's room.

338
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:44,667
Hey, heyH.

339
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:46,752
What's the matter, come on.

340
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,673
Stop for a sec, hey, hey,
can you just stop? Hey! Hey!

341
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,510
AHHHH! Fuck!

342
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,346
Stupid cunt!

343
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,893
You'll fucking listen to me now, bitch.

344
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,491
Hi. You must be Venus.

345
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,335
I would have come by earlier but
Brian says you work pretty late,

346
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,088
so I figured I'd give you
some time to sleep in...

347
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:26,930
Oh... Your stuff... from the house.

348
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,225
Brian's feeling really
weird about everything

349
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,268
as I'm sure you are too,

350
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:34,730
so I thought I'd make it
easier on both of you.

351
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,996
Look, I know this must be hard.

352
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,208
But honestly it's for the best.

353
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:59,546
Brian's very... complex,

354
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,925
Sometimes he just needs to be alone.

355
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,677
He's in a lot of pain

356
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,347
since Victoria dies.

357
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,849
Highs and lows,

358
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,477
drinking, depression,

359
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,104
the occasional fling at the strip club...

360
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,192
he's just very...

361
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:22,985
lost.

362
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,782
And I'm really... the only one...

363
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,160
who... knows how to take care of him.

364
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:44,632
Fucking bitch.

365
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,365
Fuck.

366
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,622

He said no fuck you, you put me in there,

00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:18,998
I didn't put you in there!

369
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,924
You put me in there cause
you fucking told me.

370
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,214
And I said shit, fuck you, who are you?

371
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,381
Who are you?

372
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,467
Get outta my house! Get outta my house!

373
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,059
Hi sweetie,

374
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:27,022

375
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:58,887
Hey, it's me.

376
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,932
I just got back, I guess you're busy.

377
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,227
Anyway, I'm just hanging out.

378
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,396

01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,650

380
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,359

Rough night.

Holy shit.

413
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,178
She's really messed up.

414
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,264
Venus, are you ok? Honey?

415
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,577
Girl, what's wrong with you?

01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,663
Are you ok? Venus?

Alright, I got it.

425
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:08,613
Girl, come on let's go.

01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:18,557
Hi.

What can I say I'm fucking
just a piece of shit, ya know?

440
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:03,353
I just... l just can't hold on
to anything that's good.

441
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,563
You're not a piece of shit, Brian,

442
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:08,566
you're just... you're just really hurting.

443
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,486
You've been through so much, you know?

444
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,867
She uhh... she didn't even
leave a goddamn note.

445
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:21,912
I know..

446
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,591
I don't think you should
be alone right now.

447
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:26,793
Let me come and see you.

448
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,505

I wanted to love you, Venus.

450
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:35,759
I know...

451
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,888
Nobody's ever loved me
the way that you have...

452
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,977
I'm gonna come by and uhh,

453
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,229

Open the fucking door, bitch!
Get the fuck here!

461
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,648
You're gonna pay for what you did.

462
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:35,236
Get the fuck out here right now, bitch!

463
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:17,445
I'm gonna see you, on the
moon, and I don't care!

01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:28,373
Light in your face... and I don't

Get out you little bitch!
Get the fuck out of the car!

01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:39,402
Gaahhhh, fucking bitch! Fucking bitch!

471
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:44,323
Fuck. You wanna do this?

472
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:45,533
You wanna fucking do this?

473
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,909
We're gonna do this.

474
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,463
That's a good girl.

475
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:22,487
Get out of the fucking car!

476
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:26,032
I said get out of the fucking car

477
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:28,951

Fuck.

479
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,235
Hi, I'm leaving in five

480
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:46,362
Venus, look I've been
trying to call you, ok?

481
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,594
I shouldn't have agreed to you
coming over in the first place.

482
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:52,994
It's just... it just wasn't a good idea.

483
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:56,914
Venus look, I just can't do this, ok?

484
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:57,832
Brian

485
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:00,418
No, Venus listen to me.
I know you're hurting.

486
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:03,129
You're fucking being selfish, 0k?

487
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,881
This isn't about your feelings.

488
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,383
You wish things were different, fucking...

489
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,176
I wish things were different.

490
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,011
Brian please.

491
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,638
I wish Victoria didn't fucking kill herself
but she did.

492
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:17,643
My wife killed herself
and I miss her every single fucking day!

493
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:20,021
I just... l just need you to go away.

494
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,272
I just need to be alone.

495
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,608
Please Venus, just leave me alone.

496
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:49,026
- Hey.
- Hey, I need a favor.

497
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:02,122
Hey it's Cha...

498
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:16,136
Hey.

499
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,100
I'm here.

500
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,730
Venus? Venus?

501
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:28,314
Earth to Venus.

502
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:31,008
You performing live tonight, bitch?

503
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:32,807
The fuck you gonna do with this?

504
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,312
You thinking about going blonde?

505
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,161
I see that for you.

506
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,706
Hey? Venus?

507
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,835
Girl, what's wrong with you?
Did you take something?

508
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,254
Venus, talk to me girl, what's wrong?

509
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,925
Alright, come on, we'll sit down,
smoke a fag and calm down,

510
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:56,135
wait, where you going?

511
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:57,343
To see Brian.

512
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:58,678
Dressed like that?

513
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:01,891
Girl seriously, this guy got you upset
and you're acting stupid.

514
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,259
No man should have you're head
all messed up like that.

515
01:16:04,852 --> 01:16:06,572
Come on Venus you remember what I told you?

516
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:08,522
Venus? Venus?

517
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,818
Never date a man you meet at the fucking
club, got your head all fucked up.

518
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:15,196
He dated your ass for months,
he made you fall in love with him,

519
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:16,405
and then he dropped your ass.

520
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:19,447
That doesn't sound like a man, Venus,
that sound like a fucking pussy to me!

521
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:04,912
Shit! Fuck!

522
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,590
911, where is your emergency?

523
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,232
Yeah, I'm in an apartment and there,
and there's a dead body here.

524
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,679
Ok mam, I need you to slow down
and I need you to tell me exactly...

525
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,597
I know who did it, her name is Venus.

526
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,766
She just left and I know where she's going.

527
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,351
Don't move!

528
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,397
You're under arrest! Freeze!

529
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:40,567
Brian! Brian! No! Brian!

530
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:11,015
What happened in Paris?

531
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:17,395
What do you mean?

532
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:20,190
Well you were dancing
at the Paris ballet studio...

533
01:20:22,276 --> 01:20:23,716
Can you tell me what happened there?

534
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,614
I was dancing in a show.

535
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:33,954
But you were removed from the company.
Do you remember why?

536
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,048
I'm looking at an article here,

537
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:46,050
and it says,

538
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:50,179
a Sterling ballet school
alum, Venus Noella,

539
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:54,892
has allegedly pushed fellow ballet dancer
Thomas Pagan down a flight of stairs

540
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:58,437
at the Paris ballet studio
following the evening's performance.

541
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,939
Thomas is currently in intensive care

542
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:05,861
and is speculated to be paralyzed
from the wasit down.

543
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:14,320
Now, I uhh, I understand no charges
were filed due to lack of evidence.

544
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:17,498
When did you last speak to Doctor Kardash?

545
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:24,254
I just want to talk to Brian.

546
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,345
I have someone waiting outside.

547
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,473
I'd like to bring them in now.

548
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:45,566
Please come in.

549
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:24,523
Venus? Have you ever met this woman?

550
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:28,943
Yes.

551
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:34,908
No... Venus, we've never met.

552
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:44,585
You followed me, to the desert.

553
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,590
I was never in the desert with you.

554
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:07,357
You're still fucking Brian, aren't you?

555
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:11,444
No.

556
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,490
I saw you...

557
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:18,327
fucking him, in his house.

558
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:27,544
I have a boyfriend... l
would never cheat on him.

559
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:31,924
I don't know what you saw.

560
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:43,143
The last time I saw Brian,
we were having dinner.

561
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:49,983
He told me he was seeing someone,
but he wanted to end it.

562
01:23:52,819 --> 01:24:00,494
And then l... got home from work the
next night. The doorbell rings.

563
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,915
That's when I found my cat.

564
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:11,338
And then shortly after,
a detective shows up at my door

565
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:15,217
saying a woman named Venus was arrested,

566
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:17,928
claiming that she killed me.

567
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:24,268
That's when I found out what happened.

568
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:29,147
And that's why I'm here.

569
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:41,076
Because I want you to know what you did.

570
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:45,496
Venus?

571
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:48,541
Venus?

572
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,210
When you were arrested,

573
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:53,964
you were found inside Brian's house,

574
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,046
what were you doing there?

575
01:24:58,468 --> 01:24:59,845
I was with Brian.

576
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:03,932
We were... we were making love.

577
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:09,354
No. You were alone.

578
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:27,039
I need you to look at this photograph now.

579
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,170
Venus?

580
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:05,827
Venus, Venus!

581
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,121
Venus... Venus!

582
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:16,045
I can't do this.

583
01:26:18,465 --> 01:26:19,465
<i>OK'?</i>

584
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:24,387
I'm sorry...

585
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:28,225
I gotta go.
