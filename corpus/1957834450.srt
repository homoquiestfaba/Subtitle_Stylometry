1
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,740
You guys wanna know a secret?

2
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,783
Yeah!

3
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:35,537
For four years, my wife and I
couldn't get pregnant.

4
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,038
And it was my fault.

5
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:42,000
For years!
The secret was killing me, man.

6
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,460
I was at <i>The Daily Show.</i>

7
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,840
Every day, Trevor Noah would come up to me
with those cute-ass pimples.

8
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,342
"Hey, friend, what's going on?"

9
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,553
"What's going on with you and Beena?"

10
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:54,930
"You're like Indian Barbie and Ken."

11
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:57,683
And I'm like, "I know."

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,310
And much like Ken…

13
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,233
…my parts don't work.

14
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,697
Do you know what it's like to be a guy
and find out your balls are broken?

15
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:14,575
It's humiliating!

16
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,662
Dude, I felt lied to my entire life.

17
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:22,082
Growing up, they told me
my sperm is radioactive.

18
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,792
Remember sex ed?

19
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:24,710
Yeah!

20
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,963
Do you remember the way
they would horrify us young boys?

21
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:32,050
One morning you're sitting there,
Mrs. Lettington just bursts in.

22
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,887
"Watch out, boys."

23
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,513
"Your pre-cum will get girls pregnant."

24
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,937
"Don't look at anyone!"

25
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,232
"Your pre-cum will get girls pregnant."

26
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:51,612
"Hasan, the cum before you come
can conceive a life!"

27
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,655
You're like, "Mrs. Lettington, I'm nine."

28
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,033
"This is terrifying."

29
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,658
"Good!"

30
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,287
"Now, let's watch a live birth."

31
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,040
You're like, "Nooooo!"

32
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,502
"Why did my parents sign the waiver?"

33
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,758
And anyone going through
fertility problems,

34
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,635
you know it loads the relationship

35
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:17,428
with all this pressure, you know?

36
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,767
Me and Beena, we'd be up late at night
having these really tough conversations.

37
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,978
You know, "Is this gonna happen for us?"

38
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:27,607
"Are we gonna be able to have kids?"

39
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,733
Then I was like, "Babe, what if we adopt?"

40
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:35,657
"What if we adopt a white baby
just to flex on these motherfuckers?"

41
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,787
Just to show people we made it,
you know what I mean?

42
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:44,207
Reverse Angelina Jolie power move.

43
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,293
We'll show him off at parties,
just this chubby white kid with asthma.

44
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,628
You know what I mean?

45
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:55,467
He's just like, "Hi."
"I'm Bradley Minhaj."

46
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,055
"I'm a proud member
of the Indian-American community."

47
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,643
"This is my son!"

48
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:06,853
"Bradley."

49
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,690
"We saved him

50
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,733
from a war-torn part of America."

51
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:14,612
"Detroit."

52
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,780
Everyone's like, "Oh, wow."

53
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,453
Beena's like, "I don't want a white baby."

54
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,667
I'm like, "Whatever. You're racist."

55
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,670
"All Bradleys matter."

56
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,008
She's like, "Hasan, I don't want
a white baby, don't you understand?"

57
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,387
"I want a baby with you."

58
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,013
Aww!

59
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,515
I know!

60
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:46,602
That's Beena, that's why I married her.

61
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,022
Family is everything to her.

62
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,398
She's a Patel.

63
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,030
She has 961 cousins…
at this show tonight.

64
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,365
And she's a motel Patel.

65
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,535
So that family shit runs deep. Yeah!

66
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,580
You ever notice that
every motel you've ever stayed at,

67
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,998
all owned by Indian people?

68
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,875
Look at the name tag: "Patel."

69
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,462
They're all from one part of India
and they're all related.

70
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,340
If you've stayed at a Hampton Inn,
a La Quinta Inn, a Quality Inn,

71
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,843
a Comfort Inn, a Super 8, you have been
supporting this Patel cartel.

72
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,138
For centuries we have been debating:

73
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,682
Indian, Asians, Jews,

74
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,600
"Who is the cheapest of them all?"

75
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,602
Motherfucker, it's Indians.

76
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,025
Only Gujarati Indians would choose
a family business you could live at.

77
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,947
That was Beena's kingdom, man.

78
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:42,867
The kingdom of La Quinta Inn.

79
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,372
And now she wanted
to start a kingdom with me.

80
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,083
Dude, I'm gonna be honest with you guys.

81
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,503
I was kind of glad
we were having fertility problems.

82
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,217
I didn't want to have kids.

83
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,720
I was like, "Come on, babe,
I just got verified on Instagram."

84
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:07,473
"Let me enjoy this clout."

85
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,602
She's like,
"I don't give a shit about clout."

86
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,022
"The only reason why we can't get pregnant

87
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:16,400
is because it took you
ten years to propose to me."

88
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,443
"Yeah!"

89
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,028
"I went to the doctor."

90
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:25,367
"It's not my ovaries, motherfucker,
it's your balls."

91
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:27,787
"Go get your balls checked out."

92
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm like, "Hey,
don't bring them into this."

93
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:34,208
'Cause here's the thing, I'm at that age
where I don't like going to the doctor.

94
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,088
'Cause a lot of doctors are my age.

95
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,553
And they're Indian,
which means I might know them.

96
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:48,098
So we're sitting there
in the waiting room at NYU, right?

97
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,225
Door opens, nurse comes out.

98
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,103
She's like, "Dr. Gupta will see you now."

99
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:59,152
I'm like, "Oh, this better not be
Arjun Gupta from Sacramento."

100
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,653
Then I hear a familiar voice,
he's like, "Hasan Minhaj!"

101
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,282
I'm like, "This is Arjun Gupta
from Sacramento!"

102
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,785
"I know this kid, he's a fucking idiot!"

103
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,957
He failed out of the Caribbean med school.

104
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:15,000
Twice!

105
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,502
I go, "Arjun, how are you licensed?"

106
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,253
He's like, "I don't know."

107
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,217
"That's why I'm a jizz doctor
with a basement office."

108
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,593
"Yo, drop your pants. How's Auntie?"

109
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,930
I'm like, "Don't talk
about my mom, Arjun!"

110
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,598
"Beena, he's not even an MD!"

111
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,520
"He's a goddamn DO!"

112
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,068
"Oh, boo, boo it up, DOs."

113
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:42,152
In the back.

114
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:45,532
Doctors of osteopathic medicine
hate that joke.

115
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,575
So, MDs and DOs,

116
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,162
they're basically the same,
they're both good doctors.

117
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:55,998
The only thing is, a DO's sense of humor

118
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,960
stops at their MCAT score.

119
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,923
You see those seats way back there,
those are the DO seats.

120
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,512
These are the MD seats.
Do you know what the difference is?

121
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,347
It's five points on your MCAT, okay?

122
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,978
So this dude is all up in my merchandise.
He's like, "Aw, bro, I know what's wrong."

123
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,772
I'm like, "Stop saying 'bro.'"

124
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,692
He's like, "<i>Son, </i>oh…"

125
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,153
"You got too much blood down there,
it's lowering your sperm count,

126
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,573
so we're going to do a dangerous surgery
called varicocele repair."

127
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,785
"But don't worry,
I'll be doing the surgery."

128
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:35,122
I go, "Arjun, I'm very worried."

129
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,373
"You're in a lab coat and Jordans."

130
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,045
Pulls out a trimmer,
"Let me shave you down right now."

131
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,925
"Let's do this right here, right now."
I go, "Arjun, back up."

132
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,468
"I'm not ready."

133
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,847
He goes, "Listen, man."

134
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,477
"If you don't get this surgery,
you can't have kids."

135
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,937
"Ever."

136
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,357
I go, "Are you serious?"

137
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,277
"Me and Beena, we can't have kids?"

138
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,488
"Like, you're telling me
we can't start a family?"

139
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,703
See, that's the crazy thing
they never tell you about adulthood.

140
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:21,627
Life gets very real when
"don't want" becomes "can't have."

141
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,880
Isn't that right, DOs?

142
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,262
So I'm sitting there naked,

143
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:34,890
and Beena is looking at me.

144
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:38,810
And I turn, and Arjun is looking at me.

145
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,523
And he pulls out the manscaper.

146
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,693
And I go, "Fuck it, give me the fade."

147
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,782
"Make the bottom match the top."

148
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,952
He puts the Darth Vader on me, right?

149
00:08:57,997 --> 00:08:59,832
I wake up six hours later, naked.

150
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,417
I look down, I'm in a huge diaper

151
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,422
with four huge blood stains on the diaper.

152
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,757
And I look up and I just see Arjun,

153
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:13,762
and I go, "Arjun,
I only have two testicles."

154
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,977
"How did you mess up two extra times?"

155
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,480
He's like, "Don't worry about it, bro,
we figured it out."

156
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,108
"Just give it six weeks."

157
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,070
And, DOs, he was right.

158
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,238
He was right.

159
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:36,158
Six weeks later, me and Beena,

160
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,747
we have hot, monogamous action.

161
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,125
Beena gets pregnant, finally,
four years in the making.

162
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,208
I know!

163
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,003
I'm in the delivery room,
she pushes the baby out.

164
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,632
I didn't know this.
Now they just throw the baby on the dad.

165
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:53,385
They're like, "Do you love it forever?"
I'm like, "It's wet."

166
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,305
They're like, "Kiss it."
I'm like, "It's not done yet."

167
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:59,098
"Let the yeast rise."

168
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,933
"It's not even brown."

169
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,268
Did you know that?

170
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,438
Brown babies don't come out brown,
they're Caucasian.

171
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,690
I'm like, "It looks like Bradley, return."

172
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,108
They're like,
"No returns, it's not Costco."

173
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,737
They put the baby on the boob.

174
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,073
Then they put the baby on me.

175
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,285
And I'm holding the baby.

176
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,455
And Beena's holding me.

177
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,542
And she goes, "Can you believe it?"

178
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,378
"We're finally a family."

179
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,255
Awww!

180
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,677
"Promise me, Hasan."

181
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:40,265
"Promise me, you will always
protect this family."

182
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:43,227
And I was like, "Of course."

183
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:45,772
"I need you."

184
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,398
"For material."

185
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,318
"Stand-up doesn't write itself."

186
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,198
Three days later, the bread had leavened.

187
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,158
It finally browned.

188
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:02,788
And I'm holding this little <i>gulab jamun,</i>
this little brown ball.

189
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,667
Yo, and here's how I knew
my daughter was Indian.

190
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,752
She wouldn't stop staring at me.

191
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,797
I was like, "Oh, you're one of us."

192
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,008
"You're not respecting
personal boundaries."

193
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,262
"Welcome to the tribe."

194
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,557
We lock eyes,
and it just hits me right here.

195
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:22,432
Parents, you know this feeling.

196
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,687
I was like, "Oh, my God,
I've never felt this before in my life."

197
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:30,523
"But I love you so much."

198
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:35,863
"I've only known you three days,
but I would do anything for you."

199
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,157
"I can't believe how much I love you."

200
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,828
And I know I've said that
to Beena before, but…

201
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,208
I was lying.

202
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,378
I was lying!

203
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:53,838
And she was lying to me!

204
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,885
Here's how I know we both
unconditionally love my daughter.

205
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,012
She's four now, okay?

206
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,513
Now, as you know, we could not
adopt a white baby, my wife is a racist.

207
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,183
But…

208
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,102
But we now live in a white state.

209
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:09,688
We live in Greenwich, Connecticut.

210
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:13,902
Ooh, yeah, it's <i>Get Out </i>white.

211
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:17,028
Everybody there works at a hedge fund.

212
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,532
And I can feel your judgment, Brooklyn.

213
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,533
Oh, you're judging me.

214
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:22,827
You're like, "Really?"

215
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,122
"You're gonna take your daughter
and raise her in Greenwich?"

216
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,582
"You're gonna spoil her like that?"

217
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,665
Nah.

218
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:34,838
I want her to see how gritty and grimy
and corrupt the real world is.

219
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,758
Every morning she wakes up
and she sees bankers and traders

220
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,843
in Patagonia puffer coats.

221
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:43,638
And I go, "Look, babe, criminals!"

222
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,143
"They're the reason
Daddy doesn't have a pension."

223
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,353
"Look at 'em!"

224
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,565
So, I'm taking her to school,
and we pull up in the Honda Odyssey.

225
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,193
I'm not trying to brag,
but your boy's really doing it.

226
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,780
Look, I used to own a black Toyota Camry,
but I had to get rid of it

227
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,448
because people would just
get into my car at intersections.

228
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,993
We pull up to school.

229
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:09,540
All the hedge fund dads are like,
"Hey! Welcome to Photo Day, Dad."

230
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,333
I'm like, "They still do Photo Day?"

231
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,797
I have a thousand photos of my daughter
in my pocket from yesterday.

232
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,508
We're still doing one photo
like it's the goddamn 1800s?

233
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:25,722
"Just today we shall take one photo

234
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,475
of your daughter!"

235
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,520
"Come, sit upon the wooden stool."

236
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,188
"Turn, look back at it."

237
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,570
"Here is a photo
of your firstborn blinking, no retakes."

238
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,947
I'm like, "That seems fair."

239
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,575
"$89.99. Thank you, Lifetouch."

240
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,535
"What a deal."

241
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,288
"I'll put this in my wallet
that I don't own anymore."

242
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,623
I put it on her stool, right?

243
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,792
She drops her mask.

244
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:57,170
She has snot all over her face.

245
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,548
Just, <i>ckckck…</i>

246
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,302
All the hedge fund dads are like, "What?"

247
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,555
Then I hear one of the dads.

248
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,932
I will never forget
this motherfucker's name.

249
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:11,185
His name is Connor.

250
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,395
Oooh! Oooh!

251
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,938
And Connor audibly goes,

252
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:18,567
"Yuck."

253
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,197
And all of the sudden, it hits me here.

254
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,407
I'm like, "Oh, this hedge fund criminal

255
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:27,868
thinks my daughter
is a <i>gundi </i>little brown girl?"

256
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,745
"Nah, not on my watch."

257
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,788
So, I'm drinking an iced coffee, right?

258
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:37,043
And I pull the green straw
out of my iced coffee.

259
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:42,132
And I walk over…
and I tilt her head back and I…

260
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,932
…suck the boogers out of her nose.

261
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,142
And I swallow that shit like a real man.

262
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,692
I would never do that for my wife.

263
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,695
Look, man, I got a thousand photos

264
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,698
of my daughter
in my pocket from yesterday.

265
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,077
But this photo is my favorite.

266
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,412
Aww!

267
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:18,252
Because for four years, I never thought
that I would be ready to be a dad.

268
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,297
But on that day…

269
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,008
I could taste it.

270
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,515
Thank you.

271
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,393
-Thank you, Brooklyn.

272
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:35,518
I'm sorry, look, listen.

273
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,563
When I see that photo of my baby girl,
I get emotional.

274
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,733
She's not like us, she's the future.

275
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,862
She's second generation.

276
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:47,322
She doesn't carry our trauma,
you know what I mean?

277
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:52,243
When I look out here tonight,
I see so many broken dreams.

278
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,248
So many IT consultants.

279
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,877
So many premed majors.

280
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:02,045
So many dudes that work at Deloitte.

281
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:07,342
My daughter has something we never had.

282
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,762
Choice.

283
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,682
She can choose who she loves.

284
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,475
She can choose her major.

285
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:20,647
She can choose whether or not
she goes to Kumon.

286
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:23,983
Anything is possible.

287
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,987
She's in control of her life.

288
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,490
The only thing that ever
gave me control was comedy.

289
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:35,328
Thank God I have comedy.
I have no other discernible skills.

290
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:38,457
Dude, I remember the first time
I found out I was funny.

291
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,752
I was a junior in high school.

292
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:45,130
I was 16 years old, it's 2002.
I'll never forget this.

293
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:48,758
So, I'm a junior,
and during fourth period,

294
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:52,472
my dad pulls me out of school
and he takes me to Friday prayer.

295
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,432
And I'm in the back of the mosque,

296
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:58,018
and in the middle of the sermon,

297
00:16:58,102 --> 00:17:01,103
this super-ripped white guy
shows up to the mosque.

298
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,942
Just bald, all trap, no neck,
barbed-wire tattoo.

299
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,737
Dude, he looked roided out.
He's just like…

300
00:17:10,782 --> 00:17:12,157
"Hi."

301
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,118
"I'm Brother Eric."

302
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,042
"I'm here to convert to Islam."

303
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,712
And my dad's like, "Hasan, you see that?"

304
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,423
"It's a miracle!"

305
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,718
"That's the power of Islam!"

306
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,347
"Eric!"

307
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,138
"Blue eyes, strong."

308
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,643
"He wants to be a Muslim."

309
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:42,145
I'm like, "Dad,

310
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,775
Eric is a federal agent."

311
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,577
"He's spying on us, I'm sorry.
He's just not that into you."

312
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,370
He's like, "No, he's into me."

313
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:01,665
Eric converts, my dad's like,
<i>"Shabash, </i>welcome to the faith."

314
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,083
"Come over for dinner!"

315
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,627
I'm like, "Are you insane?"

316
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,922
Now, I don't know what your junior year
of high school was like,

317
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,507
but have you ever had
chicken biryani with a narc?

318
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,178
This dude was a narc!

319
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:18,598
He's in our living room eating Indian food
with a fork and knife.

320
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:23,145
I'm like, "Motherfucker, use your hands.
Commit to the role."

321
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:25,647
"Convince me, Eric."

322
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:27,773
"If that's even your real name."

323
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,568
He knows I don't trust him, right?

324
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,363
So he puts his arm on my shoulder,
he goes, "Hey, bro, what's up?"

325
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,992
"What's going on, buddy?"

326
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,118
"You wanna work out?"

327
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:41,580
Which sounds weird.

328
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:44,292
But if you saw me at 16,

329
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,295
you know the answer unequivocally was

330
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:50,172
"Yes."

331
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,008
"I want to work out, Eric."

332
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:57,678
Zoom in. This is me flexing
as hard as I possibly…

333
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,267
Yo, I thought I was
killing it with tricep.

334
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,018
There's no tricep.

335
00:19:03,102 --> 00:19:05,603
All right, zoom back out.
Look, I look the same, right?

336
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,023
This is my best friend,
Will Moroski, okay?

337
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:12,487
This is what Will Moroski looks like now.

338
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,987
Blow up!

339
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:19,618
Yo, Will Moroski is built
like a Greek God.

340
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:22,788
Pecs, abs, bulge.

341
00:19:22,872 --> 00:19:25,332
I cannot stop thinking
about Will Moroski.

342
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,670
Dude, sometimes
when it's late at night, I'll be in bed.

343
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,257
And I will pull out my phone.

344
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,008
And I will slowly…

345
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:41,432
scroll through Will's… profile.

346
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,058
And Beena will wake up,

347
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,853
and she'll be like, "Are you looking at…

348
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:50,692
…OnlyFans?"

349
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,653
And I'm like, "No, it's

350
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,613
only Will."

351
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,327
"I'm really happy for him."

352
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,078
"But this is so depressing."

353
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:09,167
But it's still not as depressing
as that goddamn photo

354
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:11,212
of Kumail Nanjiani.

355
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:15,007
Fuck this photo.

356
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,217
Don't clap,
don't you dare clap at this photo.

357
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:21,305
This is a personal attack, no!
This is a personal attack!

358
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,807
When he dropped this photo,

359
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,767
he low-key-tagged
every brown dude in this room,

360
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,933
do you understand?

361
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:29,438
He tagged all of us. He's like,
"Hey, what's up, man? I'm Kumail."

362
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:34,067
"What's up, man? I'm from Karachi.
What are you doing with your life?"

363
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:36,028
I'm like, "Fuck you, Kumail!"

364
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,617
"How dare you show white people
what we could look like?!"

365
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,037
That's why I love Aziz.

366
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,373
I love Aziz!

367
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:52,668
He set the bar right where it should be,
do you understand?

368
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,797
Five foot two, built like a <i>laddu,</i>
he's eating pasta all day, right?

369
00:20:55,882 --> 00:20:58,008
He's just like, "Ooh, yummy, ooh!"

370
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:00,677
"Ooh! Pasta. Ooh, rigatoni."

371
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:01,762
"Yes!"

372
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,097
"Rigatoni!"

373
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,682
Just keep eating, fatso!
Stuff your mouth!

374
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:09,143
You think I can eat pasta
when this exists?

375
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:13,773
This is cyberbullying!

376
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,535
Oh, cancel Kumail.

377
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:25,618
Cancel him.

378
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,500
So we're at 24 Hour Fitness, and…

379
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:37,632
it's me, Brother Eric,
all my friends from the mosque, right?

380
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:42,052
This dude is power cleaning 400s.
He's like…

381
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:46,848
I'm curling 15s.

382
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:49,643
I'm like, "All right, slow and steady
wins the race."

383
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:50,768
"Progress isn't perfect."

384
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:53,522
"You can do it, yes you can.
Come on, Hasan, do it!"

385
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,692
He's like, "Stop, get over here!"

386
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,568
I'm like, "What's up, Eric?
You got creatine, glutamine, I'll do it."

387
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,070
He's like, "Shut up!"

388
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:02,948
"Everyone from the mosque,
come here right now."

389
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:05,868
All these brown, double<i> desi </i>kids
in basketball shorts are like,

390
00:22:05,952 --> 00:22:07,243
"What's up, Eric?"

391
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,913
He's like, "Shh! Come here, boys.
Come here."

392
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,500
"Let me ask you a question."

393
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,753
"You boys ever think about…

394
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,633
…jihad?"

395
00:22:24,137 --> 00:22:25,428
I was like, "What?"

396
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,183
"I thought you were gonna molest us."

397
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,022
One of my best friends, Imaran,
freaks out, he runs to the bathroom.

398
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:38,275
I'm like, Imaran, what's wrong?
He's like, "Dude, this is crazy!"

399
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,612
"Hasan, this is crazy!"

400
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,282
"Hasan! Hasan."

401
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,868
"Did Eric radicalize?"

402
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,087
"Imaran, Eric is a cop!"

403
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:02,673
"He's a <i>kamala</i>, he's entrapping us,
what are you talking about?"

404
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,510
"No, we should call the police."

405
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:09,097
I go, "No, no, don't call the police.
Let's go fuck with Eric."

406
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,143
I run back out,
this time I pick up the 20s.

407
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:16,688
I go, "Hey, Eric." He's like, "What?"

408
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:20,483
I go, "Hey, Eric? Do you know
what I wanna do one of these days?"

409
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,610
He's like, "What's that?"

410
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:25,738
I go, "I wanna get my pilot's license."

411
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,745
Then I hear a police siren. Whoo!

412
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:34,957
I look outside,
15 police cars are in the parking lot.

413
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,668
Imaran called the cops.
They bum-rush the 24 Hour Fitness.

414
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:42,382
They run past Brother Eric, they grab <i>me!</i>

415
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,802
They drag me outside, they slam
my head against the hood of the car. Boom!

416
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,468
Now shit is getting too real.

417
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:50,347
I'm not built for this,
I'm just a smedium.

418
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:57,353
And my head is against
the hood of the car and I look out,

419
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:02,777
and I see all my friends from the mosque
lined up on the curb.

420
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,530
And I can hear
the walkie-talkies going off.

421
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:09,908
They want to bring me in for questioning.

422
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,203
Now it's a whole scene,
and I hear a car door open.

423
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:16,998
And this girl from my high school,
she notices me, Elena Cervantes.

424
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:18,375
She's super fly.

425
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,503
She's like, "Hasan?"

426
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,923
You know how hard it is to holler
at a girl when your head is against a car?

427
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:28,760
I was just like, "Elena."

428
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:32,138
"What's up, girl?"

429
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:35,852
"What are you doing here?"

430
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:38,978
She's like, "Are you selling…

431
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:43,483
…drugs?"

432
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,570
I'm like, "No!"

433
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,072
"Terrorism."

434
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,033
She starts laughing.

435
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,622
Everyone in the parking lot
starts laughing.

436
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,748
The cops aren't laughing.

437
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:06,590
And that is the first joke I ever landed.

438
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:10,093
And it felt amazing!

439
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:14,515
I've never felt in control of my life.

440
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:18,310
The moment I landed that joke,
I was in control.

441
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:21,063
Eric could feel everybody laughing at him.

442
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,440
He's just like, "Fuck!"

443
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,277
"This kid isn't al-Qaeda."

444
00:25:27,737 --> 00:25:29,572
"He's an asshole."

445
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,033
That's how he knew I was American.

446
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:37,078
I was an asshole.

447
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,377
A few years later, right?

448
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:46,255
I'm back at home, I'm with my dad,
and my dad is doing that thing

449
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,882
that every retired dad does.

450
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:51,385
He's hate-watching the news.

451
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:53,387
Right?

452
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,013
And that night he happens to be watching

453
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,642
an investigative report

454
00:25:59,477 --> 00:26:01,603
about how, after 9/11,

455
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:06,192
the FBI used to embed
with the Muslim community legally

456
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:09,278
through a law called "The Patriot Act."

457
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,577
And sometimes they would get kids
to give false confessions.

458
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:21,163
And that night they were doing a story
about an undercover agent

459
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,708
in Irvine, California.

460
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,168
And I go, "Papa…

461
00:26:30,592 --> 00:26:34,052
…what a crazy story
of mystery and high jinks."

462
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:36,930
"What do you think about that?"

463
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:40,142
And he goes, "Hasan,
who would be dumb enough…

464
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:44,272
to let a federal agent into their home?"

465
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:48,733
<i>Craig Monteilh is a human</i>
<i>chameleon and a convicted con artist.</i>

466
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,695
<i>He pretended to convert</i>
<i>to Islam for the FBI</i>

467
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,822
<i>in order to work</i>
<i>the counterterrorism beat.</i>

468
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:56,408
<i>As a personal trainer,</i>
<i>he'd wear people down</i>

469
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:57,783
<i>to get them to open up.</i>

470
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:00,662
I go, "Well, well, well, Papa,
look who it is."

471
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:05,083
"It's our good friend Brother Eric!"

472
00:27:05,877 --> 00:27:08,670
And he's like, "Hasan,
are you not paying attention?"

473
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,048
"His name is not Eric."

474
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:14,635
"His name is Craig!"

475
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:22,183
Now, as the years go on,
I come to find out my hunch was correct.

476
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:25,647
Through the Patriot Act,
the feds were watching us.

477
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:29,692
And they were getting kids
to give false confessions.

478
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:31,818
In Dearborn, Michigan.

479
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:34,447
In Chicago.

480
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,992
In New York City at NYU.

481
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,953
Then I find out, in Lodi, California,
one town next to me,

482
00:27:42,872 --> 00:27:45,707
there was a 16-year-old kid,
his name was Hamid Hayat.

483
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,585
He gave a false confession.

484
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,713
This kid served 20 years in prison.

485
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:57,387
He just got out of prison this past June.

486
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:01,348
Man, he's my age, he's 36.

487
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,435
I think about Hamid all the time.

488
00:28:07,272 --> 00:28:10,023
I'm like, "What if I complied
that night like Hamid?"

489
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,237
Dude, being a smart-ass saved my life.

490
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:20,408
That's why,
when I finally got my own shot

491
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,078
to do my own show on Netflix,

492
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,290
I named that shit <i>Patriot Act.</i>

493
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:31,168
It was my middle finger to Brother Eric,
do you understand?

494
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:36,092
I'm gonna name my show after
the same program you used to spy on us.

495
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:39,262
And on <i>Patriot Act, </i>I was in control,

496
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:43,557
so I thought, "Hey,
why not go after everybody?"

497
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,100
It's my show, right?

498
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,562
Dictators, autocrats, religion.

499
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:52,148
That's why, when <i>Washington Post</i>
journalist Jamal Khashoggi

500
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:54,985
got murdered
inside of that Saudi consulate,

501
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:57,070
I thought, "Hey,
this could be our first episode."

502
00:28:58,405 --> 00:28:59,948
And I had a crazy take.

503
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,033
You remember this?

504
00:29:01,117 --> 00:29:03,952
I was like, "Saudi, hear me out.
It's your boy, Hasan."

505
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,288
Hot take!

506
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:10,877
I think murder is bad.

507
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:14,003
And the kingdom was like,
"You have gone too far, Minhaj!"

508
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:16,798
Netflix under fire today
after its decision

509
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:19,383
to pull an episode
of a comedy show that was critical

510
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:21,303
of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

511
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:25,767
Saudi Arabian officials cited article six
of their anti-cyber crime law.

512
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:27,267
I was like, wait, what law did I break?

513
00:29:27,352 --> 00:29:30,353
It was in Arabic, so I cut-and-copied it,
put it in Google Translate,

514
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:34,192
and it turns out I broke article six
of their cybercrime law,

515
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:39,655
sentencing me to five years
in Saudi prison.

516
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:42,073
I know.

517
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,618
Somehow CNN got the story right.

518
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:53,252
Now, as crazy as that sounds,
here's where the story gets even crazier.

519
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,923
That wasn't the first time
I messed with the Saudis.

520
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:02,093
I haven't talked about this publicly,

521
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,722
but way before
the whole Netflix kerfuffle,

522
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,477
I tried to interview
the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.

523
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:14,022
I'm serious, he came to New York City,

524
00:30:14,107 --> 00:30:16,692
and he was taking
all these weird meetings.

525
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:19,112
Dude, he met with Michael Bloomberg

526
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,447
at the Starbucks in Times Square.

527
00:30:22,532 --> 00:30:25,367
Do you remember this?
Look at Bloomberg's goofy ass.

528
00:30:25,952 --> 00:30:28,453
He's just like,
"Welcome to Starbucks, Your Highness."

529
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:32,958
"If you want to take a shit,
the code is 2-3-3-2, my liege."

530
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:37,045
All right.

531
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:39,007
Crown prince in New York.

532
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,258
Your boy in New York.

533
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,635
Let me shoot my shot.

534
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:47,763
Let me slide in the DMs,
it will be funny.

535
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:51,602
Now, Beena has a slightly different take

536
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,857
because she has a PhD.

537
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:00,862
And I do PowerPoint comedy.

538
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,785
So she's like, "Hasan,
do not antagonize the Saudis."

539
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:10,703
"It's dangerous."

540
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,538
I go, "I know."

541
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,542
She goes, "I'm serious."

542
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:18,170
"Don't do the interview."

543
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,963
And I go, "I won't."

544
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:23,175
And I meant it.

545
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,803
But then she left the room.

546
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:30,892
And I'm like, "Come on,
let me write a letter to Santa!"

547
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:32,683
So I was like,
"Dear Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."

548
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:35,395
"My name is Hasan Minhaj, I would like
to interview the crown prince…"

549
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:37,438
Send! They hit me back immediately.

550
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:39,858
"Dear Hasan Minhaj, we read your letter."

551
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:43,987
"Please come to the embassy."

552
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:45,488
I go, "Huh!"

553
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,118
Well, that seems cordial.

554
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,913
Now, look, I'm not an idiot.
I didn't tell Beena about this, okay?

555
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,502
I'm not a moron,
I'm not gonna tell my wife.

556
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,212
I told Jim, one of our producers.

557
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:02,297
Now, I have to be honest with you guys,
there is a slight difference

558
00:32:02,382 --> 00:32:05,552
between an embassy
and a consulate, but, fun fact,

559
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:09,178
you're not supposed
to get murdered in either.

560
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:14,058
So me and Jim, we go from New York City
all the way down to Washington, D.C.

561
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:18,105
Three blocks away,
Embassy of Saudi Arabia.

562
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,317
Me and Jim, we're about to walk in,
I go, "Jim, let's fucking go!"

563
00:32:22,402 --> 00:32:24,653
"Let's fucking go, Jim!"

564
00:32:24,737 --> 00:32:26,697
"Let's interview the Saudis."

565
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,952
"They set the fucking gas prices,
let's fuck with them."

566
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,995
He's like, "Stop dancing, you idiot!"

567
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:38,042
"We're about to walk
into a new country, you moron!"

568
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,127
"Show some respect."

569
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:42,128
I go, "Jim,

570
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,507
you show some respect."

571
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,095
"This is the goddamn
United States of America, Jim."

572
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,973
"Yeah, they're not gonna
fuck with me, Jim."

573
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:57,268
"I'm a U… S… citizen."

574
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,438
He's like, "Stop grabbing your nuts!"

575
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:01,815
"It's literally a new country."

576
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,150
"When we walk through that door,

577
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,402
it's like a green tunnel
in Super Mario Bros."

578
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:06,570
"You understand?"

579
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:08,863
"We're in America."

580
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:11,242
"We walk in, Saudi Arabia."

581
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,747
"America… Saudi Arabia."

582
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,457
And it really was like that.

583
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,833
It was like…

584
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:23,170
Saudi Arabia.

585
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,713
We walked in, it was Saudi.

586
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:28,633
Gold, chandelier, marble.

587
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:31,220
Indian servants.

588
00:33:32,222 --> 00:33:34,013
I'm like, <i>boowah.</i>

589
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,142
"You did it."

590
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:38,643
"Indian servants."

591
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:42,438
I mean, the authenticity just…

592
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,237
Because you know this,
in the Middle East,

593
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,657
Indians, Pakistanis, Bengalis,
Sri Lankans, we're the help.

594
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,825
Right? We're the Mexicans
of the Middle East.

595
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:56,495
Even brown people
have their own brown people.

596
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:58,455
That's how those buildings got there.

597
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:02,125
The only people that love shitting
on Indians more than the Saudis

598
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,543
are the Brits.

599
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:08,590
The only difference is,
we love when the Brits shit on us.

600
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:12,637
There are Indian uncles here tonight
that are like, "Wow, London, <i>dēkhō</i>."

601
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,098
"Look at London, man!"

602
00:34:16,182 --> 00:34:19,352
"My cousin lives in London!
Look at the queen."

603
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:22,397
I'm like, "Fuck the queen,
what are you talking about?"

604
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:23,857
This is insane.

605
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:28,693
Bro, in my mom's bedroom, this is true,
she has a wedding photo

606
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:30,362
of me and Beena on our wedding day.

607
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:34,117
Directly next to that photo,
it's a photo of Princess Diana!

608
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:37,327
I go, "Ma!"

609
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:41,665
"She's been dead since 1997."

610
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,418
"I'm your son."

611
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:47,503
"How are we the same?"

612
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:51,467
She's like, "Hasan,
you don't know Princess Di."

613
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,552
I'm like, "Do <i>you, </i>Mom?"

614
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:56,555
"She was so beautiful."

615
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,473
"And her mother-in-law was mean!"

616
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,477
"And her husband was cold."

617
00:35:02,562 --> 00:35:06,690
I'm like, "Ma, are you
describing <i>your </i>marriage?"

618
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,738
So we're in the Saudi embassy,
me and Jim, sitting down.

619
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:14,907
Saudi delegation walks in.

620
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,493
Fifteen men, they represent
the Saudi royal family.

621
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:20,578
They set the gas prices.

622
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:26,252
Head of the delegation circles me,
sits across from us.

623
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:28,837
"Mr. Minhaj."

624
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:32,298
"Thank you so much

625
00:35:32,842 --> 00:35:34,802
for your letter."

626
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:39,473
"Why do you want
to interview the crown prince?"

627
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:43,602
"Have you ever even been to the Gulf?"

628
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,857
Jim's like, "Don't be funny."

629
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:53,362
I go, "Jim, why would I be funny?"

630
00:35:57,992 --> 00:36:00,452
"Yeah, so…

631
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:03,997
one time I got asked to go work in Dubai,

632
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:07,877
and as soon as I landed,
they handed me a mop."

633
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,673
"Oh, you like jokes?"

634
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,177
"You like noticing things."

635
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:20,388
"Well, here is something
I have noticed, Mr. Minhaj."

636
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:25,643
"You see, the country you are from
is not like the country I am from."

637
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,232
"You see, we, Saudi…

638
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:35,362
…we were never ruled by the British."

639
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:37,865
I go, "No, no, no."

640
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:39,367
"No, no, big misunderstanding."

641
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:42,618
"See, my parents are from India, okay?"

642
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:45,913
"But as for me…

643
00:36:54,132 --> 00:36:55,798
…I'm an American."

644
00:36:57,508 --> 00:37:00,262
"Like I said, Mr. Minhaj,

645
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:06,435
we were never ruled by the British."

646
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:11,690
"We don't get lectured or ridiculed

647
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:13,692
by anyone."

648
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:17,778
"Good luck with your show, Mr. Minhaj."

649
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:21,242
"We'll be watching."

650
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:26,038
They escort me and Jim
out of the embassy.

651
00:37:26,122 --> 00:37:28,123
Now we're sitting on the train.

652
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:29,667
We're not talking.

653
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:33,045
We get back to New York City,
I open up my phone.

654
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:35,882
Everybody at the office is texting me,
"Are you okay?"

655
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:38,800
"Are you watching the news?"
"What the fuck is on the news?"

656
00:37:39,552 --> 00:37:40,593
"CNN breaking news."

657
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:42,553
"<i>Washington Post </i>journalist
Jamal Khashoggi

658
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:45,973
murdered inside of a Saudi consulate!"

659
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:49,312
I go, "Oh, shit,
I was just in one of those!"

660
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:52,438
I run back to the apartment,
I close the door, I put the dead bolt on.

661
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:53,942
"Yeah, that'll stop 'em."

662
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:56,360
I turn, I see Beena, Beena sees me.

663
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:59,278
She goes, "Oh, my God, Hasan,
were you watching the news?"

664
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:03,117
"Jamal Khashoggi got murdered
inside of a Saudi consulate."

665
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,412
"Thank God you didn't meet
with the Saudis, right?"

666
00:38:09,582 --> 00:38:11,292
I was like, "Right."

667
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,710
"That would have been crazy."

668
00:38:14,837 --> 00:38:17,673
Now I feel like a piece of shit.
I have this weighted vest of guilt.

669
00:38:17,757 --> 00:38:19,967
What do I do with this feeling?
Oh, I know what to do.

670
00:38:20,552 --> 00:38:22,302
Once you do something bad,

671
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:25,222
all you have to do is
immediately do something good.

672
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:26,932
And then that gets rid of the bad thing.

673
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:29,727
So I see a pile of dishes, I go, "Cool."

674
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:33,605
"The harder I scrub these dishes,
the less bad my lie is."

675
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:35,065
And I'm going to town on the dishes.

676
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,693
I'm like, "You're not a bad person,
you're helping!"

677
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:40,528
And Beena sees it,
and she's kind of into it.

678
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,490
And she's like, "Hey…"

679
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:45,952
And I'm like, "Hey."

680
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:52,748
Then she squeezes my arm,
and she's like, "Hasan… hey."

681
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,753
And I'm like, "Hey!"

682
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,427
Then she squeezes even harder.

683
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:06,180
She's like, "Hasan, I'm saying 'heyyy.'"

684
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:10,183
"This is like a 'heyyy.'"

685
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:12,518
She rips my clothes off,
she pushes me on the couch.

686
00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:15,147
I'm <i>nunga putunga </i>on the couch!

687
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,482
I am butt-naked on the sectional.

688
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:20,903
And it's all just for dishes,
that's how low the bar is.

689
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:24,407
But this whole thing is built
on a farce, it's all a lie.

690
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:28,202
But what do I do in this moment?
Do I beat on my lady, "Stop it"?

691
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,787
"We cannot consummate this act."

692
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:33,790
"For I have the tongue of a serpent!"

693
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,208
No!

694
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:38,587
You have got to take the shots
you are given in life.

695
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:41,757
Even if they're built on a lie.

696
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,677
So we do the damn thing.

697
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:46,470
Hot,

698
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,388
monogamous

699
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:50,015
action!

700
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:53,852
The next week, I go,
"Put up the Saudi episode!"

701
00:39:55,647 --> 00:39:56,647
Later,

702
00:39:57,607 --> 00:39:59,148
the Saudis see it.

703
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,608
They ban it.

704
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:03,528
The next morning I wake up next to Beena,

705
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:07,198
and I open up my phone
and it's trending around the world.

706
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:12,287
Then I open up Twitter,
and I go, "Oh, shit."

707
00:40:13,538 --> 00:40:14,915
"I'm in trouble."

708
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:16,875
Then it starts climbing the charts.

709
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:18,962
I go, "Oh, shit!"

710
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:21,128
"I'm getting fired."

711
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:26,760
Then I become bigger than BTS,
and I go, "Oh, shit!"

712
00:40:28,012 --> 00:40:29,888
"I think I'm getting…

713
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,812
…famous."

714
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:38,813
Likes, comments, retweets,

715
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:40,817
give them to me!

716
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:44,487
Everyone in the world, care about me

717
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,657
for no particular reason.

718
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:51,910
For one day,
I knew what it felt like to be

719
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:54,247
Pete Davidson!

720
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:56,373
Oh, fuck!

721
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:58,208
Oh, my God!

722
00:40:58,292 --> 00:41:01,378
Social media fucked with my head so much,
I didn't care about the death threats.

723
00:41:01,462 --> 00:41:04,798
I open my phone, they go, "Hey,
don't you ever come to Saudi Arabia."

724
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:07,383
Sword emoji. Sword emoji. Sword emoji.

725
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:08,927
Peach.

726
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:20,857
"Khaled, do you wanna hang?"

727
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:24,693
"'Cause if you stick your sword
in my peach, they'll kill us!"

728
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:28,613
For the first time
in my life, I had clout.

729
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,073
My dream came true.

730
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:34,662
And when you have clout,
everybody wants to be your friend.

731
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:37,038
The next day I get a call
from the editor of <i>Time </i>magazine.

732
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:41,335
"Hi, I'm the editor of <i>Time </i>magazine.
Is this Hasan Minhaj?"

733
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:43,128
I go, "This is he."

734
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:48,258
"Would you like to be one of the Time
100 Most Influential People in the World?"

735
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:51,678
I go, "I love lists."

736
00:41:52,722 --> 00:41:54,388
Me and Beena,
we get to the Time 100 dinner.

737
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,725
The editor sees me,
she's in a ridiculous gown.

738
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:59,478
She goes, "Oh, my God, sweetie.
Thank you."

739
00:41:59,562 --> 00:42:02,022
"Thank you so much for coming

740
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:05,275
to our nonpretentious dinner."

741
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:09,403
"We have 100 chairs for 100 influencers."

742
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:11,073
"You are one."

743
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,825
I go, "Yeah, cool, uh…

744
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:16,328
why is this chair empty?"

745
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:19,540
She goes, "Sweetie,
that chair is for Loujain."

746
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:21,583
I'm like, "Who?"

747
00:42:22,252 --> 00:42:25,753
"Loujain. She's the Saudi
female activist…

748
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:29,173
that's being tortured right now
for driving in Saudi Arabia."

749
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:32,845
"She can't be here, obviously."

750
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:36,390
"So, we thought we would
honor <i>your </i>bravery."

751
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:41,853
"My bravery?"

752
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:43,813
"Hey, why don't you
give a toast after Dwayne?"

753
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:46,692
"Who?" "The Rock." He gets up there.

754
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:50,572
"Hi, I'd like to give a toast
to Teremana Tequila and my traps."

755
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,613
Everyone's like, "Yeah!"

756
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:53,948
"Future president!"

757
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:55,577
"Everyone give it up for Hasan!"

758
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:57,662
I'm like, "Hey, everyone."

759
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:01,290
"Thank you so much for inviting me
to your Illuminati dinner."

760
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:04,502
"You don't know me,
but I did an episode about Saudi Arabia,

761
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:07,462
but we should be honoring
the person who can't be here."

762
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:10,173
"Her name is Loujain.
She should be sitting in that chair."

763
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,802
Then I hear the side door open.

764
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,013
And from the shadows
emerges an individual.

765
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:19,392
And into the room steps

766
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:23,395
Jared Kushner.

767
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:28,983
Who, by the way, is WhatsApp friends

768
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:32,028
with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.

769
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:34,948
And he sees the empty chair.

770
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:38,118
Loujain's symbolic chair.

771
00:43:39,037 --> 00:43:44,625
And he walks over
and he sits down in her chair.

772
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:49,713
And now the Adderall is hitting.

773
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:55,010
And I go, "Oh, I'm gonna light
this motherfucker up."

774
00:43:55,968 --> 00:44:00,182
And Beena sees my Adderall eyes.
She goes, "Hasan, do not cross that line."

775
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:02,392
I go, "Too late, Beena."

776
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:07,397
"Ladies and gentlemen,
crazy turn of events."

777
00:44:07,482 --> 00:44:09,442
"You know…

778
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:12,568
I know we're talking about Loujain,
but hypothetically,

779
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:16,448
what if someone here
knew the crown prince

780
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:18,908
and could get Loujain out of prison?"

781
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:23,038
Then I look directly at Jared Kushner.

782
00:44:23,122 --> 00:44:26,292
<i>And, you know, I know there's a lot</i>
<i>of very powerful people here,</i>

783
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:28,627
<i>and it would be crazy if,</i>
<i>I don't know, if there was just</i>

784
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,838
<i>like a high-ranking official</i>
<i>in the White House that…</i>

785
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:36,260
<i>could WhatsApp MBS and say,</i> <i>"Hey, maybe…</i>

786
00:44:37,262 --> 00:44:40,388
<i>you could help that person get out</i>
<i>of prison 'cause they don't deserve it."</i>

787
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:43,725
"And here's the craziest part,
hypothetical person."

788
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:50,148
"You could totally get away with it

789
00:44:51,317 --> 00:44:56,072
because WhatsApp
has end-to-end encryption."

790
00:44:57,907 --> 00:45:00,993
"So no one would ever know."

791
00:45:02,118 --> 00:45:03,120
"Good night."

792
00:45:04,162 --> 00:45:09,502
And I sit down and no one is laughing.

793
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:13,213
We get back in the car, Beena is livid.

794
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:15,717
She goes, "Hasan, you are out of control."

795
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:17,467
I go, "Baby girl…

796
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:19,303
shhhh!"

797
00:45:19,387 --> 00:45:22,055
"Open your phone!"

798
00:45:22,138 --> 00:45:24,725
"Likes, comments, retweets!"

799
00:45:24,808 --> 00:45:29,897
"I am trending number one again!"

800
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,858
And I am letting the comments roll in,

801
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:36,570
and I go, "Come to Papa, give it to me!"

802
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:38,780
"Give me all the glory!"

803
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:41,658
"Fill the hole that was never filled
by my parents!"

804
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:44,037
"Yummy, yummy, yum-yum."

805
00:45:44,118 --> 00:45:46,455
"Ooh, tasty!"

806
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:51,543
She's like, "Oh, cool,
so you did this for the activists."

807
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:53,587
I go, "Yes."

808
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:56,423
"The feed is active."

809
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:01,720
"I love how you only care about these
issues when there's a camera on you."

810
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:03,555
I'm like, "I know, right?"

811
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,392
"Pics, or it didn't happen."

812
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:14,067
Don't judge me, Brooklyn.

813
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:17,110
You're just like me.

814
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:20,113
Yeah, I've been watching you all night.

815
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:23,658
You're fucking tweaking
without your phones.

816
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:26,537
I like your voice.

817
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:30,958
I'm talking to you right now.

818
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:35,420
He can't even record this moment.
Did it even happen?

819
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:40,883
You have to remember it in your mind
like a fuckin' loser?

820
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,182
What's the most amount of likes
you've ever gotten on a photo?

821
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:49,518
Eighty-six.

822
00:46:49,602 --> 00:46:50,937
Eighty-six?

823
00:46:56,192 --> 00:46:58,193
Eighty-six.

824
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:06,743
If I only got 86 likes on a photo,
I would kill myself.

825
00:47:09,705 --> 00:47:14,918
Do you know how many likes
daddy got on his Kushner dunk?

826
00:47:15,587 --> 00:47:21,508
Oh, daddy got 347,391.

827
00:47:21,592 --> 00:47:24,595
Oh, and once you get a taste
of the cocaine clout,

828
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:26,805
oh, the social media meth.

829
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:28,932
Facebook fentanyl.

830
00:47:29,017 --> 00:47:32,603
I had to go harder in the paint.
I'll die for these likes!

831
00:47:32,687 --> 00:47:37,065
Oh, I know, let's go after
every single dictator in the world.

832
00:47:37,148 --> 00:47:39,027
Bolsonaro in Brazil. Let's go after him.

833
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:41,320
Duterte in the Philippines,
let's go after him.

834
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:45,198
To fuck with Indian family members,
I went to the Trump/Modi rally in Houston.

835
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:53,415
Oh, come on.

836
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:02,217
I am!

837
00:48:13,102 --> 00:48:15,395
Everybody wants clout!

838
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:18,107
Even Indian uncles want clout!

839
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,652
I put it up on Instagram,
it goes platinum again!

840
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:23,653
I get back to New York City.

841
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:25,697
I'm pushing baby girl in the stroller.

842
00:48:25,782 --> 00:48:28,242
Everybody knows your boy.

843
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:31,118
I get to my apartment building,
even my doorman sees me

844
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:33,247
and he goes, "Hasan, stop!"

845
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,498
"You need to respect Modi,

846
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:36,833
India

847
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:38,793
and Hindus!"

848
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:41,255
I go, "Carlos, you're Puerto Rican."

849
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:47,135
He's like, "I know,
but I saw that shit on Instagram."

850
00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:48,387
"It was funny."

851
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,430
"Yo, you got fan mail."

852
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:52,267
I go, "Gimme my fan mail, Carlos."

853
00:48:52,348 --> 00:48:54,810
He grabs a stack of letters,
he hands them to me, I rip it open.

854
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:59,523
I flip it over and all this white powder
falls into the stroller.

855
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:04,112
And it falls on my daughter's shoulder.

856
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:07,238
Her neck, her cheeks.

857
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:10,367
And she's staring at me.

858
00:49:12,537 --> 00:49:14,288
And I run upstairs and I tell Beena.

859
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:17,792
And this time I can't lie.

860
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:22,838
We rush down to NYU,

861
00:49:24,257 --> 00:49:26,550
but this time we go through
the emergency room.

862
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,138
And the moment they see the baby,
they just rip the clothes off her

863
00:49:31,222 --> 00:49:32,307
and they take her away.

864
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,562
And me and Beena, we're sitting
in the waiting room for hours,

865
00:49:37,643 --> 00:49:39,228
and we're not talking.

866
00:49:40,982 --> 00:49:43,525
Finally, around midnight, nurse comes in
and she's holding my daughter.

867
00:49:45,568 --> 00:49:47,447
But she's with an investigator.

868
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:51,575
And the investigator
reaches into his pocket

869
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:55,037
and he pulls out a plastic baggie

870
00:49:56,122 --> 00:49:57,663
filled with white powder.

871
00:49:59,248 --> 00:50:03,337
He goes, "Mr. Minhaj, you're very lucky."

872
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:06,423
"This isn't real anthrax."

873
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:10,302
"But I've been in this department
long enough to know

874
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:12,638
this shit just doesn't come
out of nowhere."

875
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:15,432
"So I have to ask you something,
young man:

876
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:20,647
who on earth have you been antagonizing?"

877
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:28,070
"Everybody."

878
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:31,865
"Do you have to do that?"

879
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,827
I'm like, "I don't know."

880
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:40,040
"I don't know why I'm doing this."

881
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,418
They give the baby back to Beena,

882
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:46,088
and I reach over to hold my daughter.

883
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,048
And Beena won't let me touch her.

884
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:51,677
And it kills me.

885
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:56,557
We get home, she puts the baby down,
then she finally talks to me.

886
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,102
She goes, "Okay, we're going
to talk about this once,

887
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:02,522
then we're never going to talk
about it ever again."

888
00:51:03,355 --> 00:51:05,942
"The only reason why we're here tonight

889
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,530
is because you chose clout over our kids."

890
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:14,492
I go, "Kids"?

891
00:51:15,908 --> 00:51:17,452
Did you say, "Kids"?

892
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:20,538
She goes, "I'm pregnant."

893
00:51:21,998 --> 00:51:23,625
I'm like, "The sequel?"

894
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:26,378
"Arjun was right?"

895
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,340
"I mean, he's just a DO."

896
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,303
"You get to say
whatever you want onstage,

897
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:37,307
and we have to live
with the consequences."

898
00:51:37,388 --> 00:51:39,348
"Hasan, do you even have a line?"

899
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:41,602
"Because this is crazy."

900
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:45,522
"I don't give a shit that <i>Time </i>magazine
thinks you're an 'influencer.'"

901
00:51:45,607 --> 00:51:52,403
"If you ever put my kids in danger again,
I will leave you in a second."

902
00:51:54,032 --> 00:51:56,700
-Whoo!
-That's her cousin.

903
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:01,413
That shit is real, man.

904
00:52:02,332 --> 00:52:03,623
Beena's right.

905
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:10,297
It's crazy because the first joke
I ever told saved my life.

906
00:52:11,382 --> 00:52:14,593
And now my stupid-ass jokes
almost cost me my baby's life.

907
00:52:14,677 --> 00:52:17,888
I'm like, yeah, fuck this.
This is out of control.

908
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:21,142
I don't want to be the Tupac of comedy.

909
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:25,812
I'm serious, man, I'm trying
to live to see these retweets.

910
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:30,025
If anything, I want to be
the Puffy of comedy.

911
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:35,738
I wanna live while
more talented people die around me.

912
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:40,743
That's the dream!

913
00:52:42,497 --> 00:52:44,832
Beena goes, "Do you know
what the saddest part is, Hasan?"

914
00:52:45,998 --> 00:52:49,503
"Everybody knows you, huh?
You're the <i>Log Kia Kahenge </i>guy."

915
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:53,590
"Oh, yeah, you don't care
'what other people think' about you."

916
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:55,552
"Motherfucker, I know you."

917
00:52:56,843 --> 00:52:59,930
"You so care what
other people think about you."

918
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:02,517
I go, "How can I not?"

919
00:53:03,017 --> 00:53:06,687
Every time I pull out my phone, I can hear
what all you guys are saying about me.

920
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:08,563
Every time I open up my phone,
I just see it:

921
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:11,983
"Yo, why does Hasan Minhaj
look like a raccoon on Adderall?"

922
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:13,360
I see that!

923
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:16,863
"Oh, why does this cartoon
look like Hasan Minhaj?"

924
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:18,157
I see that!

925
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,412
"Oh, brown girls be fighting
over diet Hasan Minhaj."

926
00:53:22,493 --> 00:53:24,413
I see that!

927
00:53:24,497 --> 00:53:26,790
And it hurts my feelings!

928
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:30,043
Because it's accurate, you assholes!

929
00:53:31,043 --> 00:53:33,922
I do look like a raccoon on Adderall.

930
00:53:34,007 --> 00:53:35,798
But do you know what that means?

931
00:53:37,552 --> 00:53:40,303
If I can hear what you're saying about me,

932
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:42,807
then so can kings.

933
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,600
Think about it.

934
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:47,562
Vladimir Putin.

935
00:53:47,643 --> 00:53:49,022
Narendra Modi.

936
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,232
Brother Eric.

937
00:53:52,442 --> 00:53:54,402
The crown prince.

938
00:53:55,777 --> 00:53:57,613
The Fresh Prince.

939
00:53:59,157 --> 00:54:02,577
They don't like being made fun of.

940
00:54:07,998 --> 00:54:10,752
That's why I love being a jester.

941
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:17,842
Because no matter how much money
or power or fame you have,

942
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:21,262
you can't buy your way out of ridicule.

943
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,515
But Beena's right.

944
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:26,308
I gotta have a line.

945
00:54:26,392 --> 00:54:28,560
So I go, "Babe, let me make this up
to my daughter

946
00:54:28,643 --> 00:54:31,022
the same way every shitty dad does."

947
00:54:31,103 --> 00:54:33,898
"I will buy my way back into her heart."

948
00:54:34,525 --> 00:54:37,362
Everyone in the Honda Odyssey--
me, Beena, baby-- we get in the car.

949
00:54:37,443 --> 00:54:38,820
We pull up to school the next day.

950
00:54:38,903 --> 00:54:40,363
Guess what day it is?

951
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:42,492
It's not Picture Day!

952
00:54:42,573 --> 00:54:45,662
It's the Scholastic Book Fair!

953
00:54:45,743 --> 00:54:47,997
Yes! Do you remember
the Scholastic Book Fair,

954
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,373
that carnival of capitalism once a year?

955
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:52,960
The doors would open,
the Scholastic Book man would walk out

956
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:56,172
and go, "Hey, kids,
how much do your parents love you?"

957
00:54:57,005 --> 00:55:00,883
"Some of you will get books,
most of you will get rulers."

958
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:02,928
And you're like, "Noooo!"

959
00:55:03,012 --> 00:55:05,888
I go, "Baby girl,
Daddy's buying out the bar."

960
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:07,642
"Let's get all the books."

961
00:55:07,723 --> 00:55:10,853
<i>Baby-Sitters Club, </i>all of them.
<i>Goosebumps, </i>all of them.

962
00:55:10,937 --> 00:55:13,813
<i>Dr. Seuss, </i>all of them,
even the racist ones.

963
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:16,733
And I grab 'em, I go, "Look at this shit."

964
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:19,068
"Connor, look at it."

965
00:55:20,403 --> 00:55:21,863
And he goes, "Good for you, Hasan."

966
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:25,033
I go, "Connor, what is your problem?"

967
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:28,537
"I've been trying to connect with you
all year and you will not let me in."

968
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,788
"What do you even do?"

969
00:55:31,457 --> 00:55:35,335
"Well, Mr. Comedian, unlike you,
I have a real job."

970
00:55:36,212 --> 00:55:38,505
"I work for Alden Global Capital."

971
00:55:39,382 --> 00:55:43,052
"I work in strategic acquisitions
and leveraged buyouts."

972
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,430
"I don't know if you've seen my LinkedIn."

973
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:49,642
I go, "Connor, I'm a comedian."

974
00:55:50,558 --> 00:55:52,227
"We're not on LinkedIn."

975
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:54,605
"What do you do?"

976
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:57,442
"We use debt to buy companies."

977
00:55:57,523 --> 00:55:59,943
"We gut them, fire almost everybody."

978
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:03,405
"Then we flip that asset for a profit

979
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:04,823
thanks to <i>moi."</i>

980
00:56:05,573 --> 00:56:08,077
I go, "Oh, cool. Stealing?"

981
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:11,622
"You're gonna lecture me about stealing?"

982
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:16,377
"Perhaps you and Beena
should lecture your daughter."

983
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:19,797
"Your daughter is a thief."

984
00:56:20,757 --> 00:56:24,302
And I turn around and baby girl's
putting books into her backpack.

985
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:27,303
And she's walking
out of the book fair with the books,

986
00:56:27,428 --> 00:56:28,847
but he can't say that, only I can.

987
00:56:28,932 --> 00:56:30,098
I go, "Beena, what do we do?"

988
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:33,602
She grabs me, she goes,
"Hasan, light this motherfucker up."

989
00:56:33,685 --> 00:56:36,730
So I go, "Connor, no,
she's not stealing."

990
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:41,985
"She's actually doing
a 'strategic acquisition' of those books."

991
00:56:42,068 --> 00:56:43,903
"We're looking for a profit.
Now, I'm on one."

992
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:48,742
The next day I run into the office,
I go, "Producers, everyone in my office!"

993
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:53,788
"Tell me everything there is to know
about Alden Global Capital."

994
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:58,002
"This episode is for my family."

995
00:56:58,962 --> 00:57:02,632
Producers go, "Alden Global Capital
is involved in leveraged…"

996
00:57:02,713 --> 00:57:04,675
"Buyouts?"
They're like, "How did you know?"

997
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:07,135
I'm like, "I learned it
at the Scholastic Book Fair."

998
00:57:07,718 --> 00:57:09,597
They're like, "Yeah, great, um…"

999
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,558
So it turns out,
Connor and his boss, Randall Smith,

1000
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:14,602
they're gutting local news
all across the country.

1001
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:17,772
They fired almost everyone,
they sold off the real estate

1002
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:19,648
and then flipped it for a profit,

1003
00:57:19,732 --> 00:57:26,697
and Randall Smith used
those profits to buy 16 mansions.

1004
00:57:27,488 --> 00:57:30,617
One of which is down the street from

1005
00:57:31,577 --> 00:57:34,663
Jeffrey Epstein.

1006
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:38,667
Now the Adderall is hitting <i>you.</i>

1007
00:57:40,793 --> 00:57:42,672
I go, "Producers!"

1008
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:44,923
"Joke idea."

1009
00:57:45,967 --> 00:57:48,718
"Let's put up billboards
in every major market

1010
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:50,678
that Alden Capital is gutting

1011
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:55,267
and have them read
'Randall Smith Loves Pedophiles.'"

1012
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:59,103
"In Salt Lake City, Utah;
in Raleigh, North Carolina;

1013
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:00,813
in Miami, Florida."

1014
00:58:00,898 --> 00:58:02,317
"Put 'em up!"

1015
00:58:02,398 --> 00:58:05,152
The next day, Sam,
the head attorney at Netflix,

1016
00:58:05,235 --> 00:58:06,820
calls me, shitting his pants.

1017
00:58:06,903 --> 00:58:08,863
"Hasan, are you out of your mind?!"

1018
00:58:08,947 --> 00:58:12,202
"Cancel the billboards.
That is not funny!"

1019
00:58:12,283 --> 00:58:14,578
"That is defamation!"

1020
00:58:14,662 --> 00:58:16,622
I go, "Sam, calm down."

1021
00:58:17,915 --> 00:58:19,583
"You're a liar."

1022
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:22,962
"You don't even know what's funny."

1023
00:58:24,672 --> 00:58:27,548
And it kills him, he goes,
"That may be true,

1024
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:29,427
but you cannot do that."

1025
00:58:29,552 --> 00:58:31,053
"Do not cross that line!"

1026
00:58:31,137 --> 00:58:33,472
I go, "Why not, Sam?"

1027
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:35,557
He goes, "Great question, Hasan."

1028
00:58:35,642 --> 00:58:37,308
"You see, according to American tort law,

1029
00:58:37,392 --> 00:58:40,145
there is something called
'the reasonable person standard.'"

1030
00:58:40,228 --> 00:58:42,982
"It says that a joke
is clearly not defamation

1031
00:58:43,065 --> 00:58:45,817
if it's clearly a joke
to a reasonable person."

1032
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:47,862
"And the Supreme Court
has ruled repeatedly

1033
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:52,157
that most Americans are reasonable
and of average intelligence."

1034
00:58:56,953 --> 00:59:01,167
I go, "Sam, I don't know
how the math works here,

1035
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:04,168
but I think the average American

1036
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:07,213
has below-average intelligence."

1037
00:59:09,342 --> 00:59:11,468
"That is not what the court thinks."

1038
00:59:12,678 --> 00:59:14,805
"They think more of people."

1039
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:18,933
"And frankly, my friend, so should you."

1040
00:59:23,022 --> 00:59:25,148
I go, "Sam, it would be great
to live in that world."

1041
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:30,070
"Because it's the kind of world
I want to live in."

1042
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,823
I want to perform for reasonable people.

1043
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:38,453
I want to be able to switch
between satire and sincerity

1044
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:40,582
and trust that you know the difference.

1045
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:44,002
Trust that you won't
take me out of context.

1046
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:47,212
Everything here tonight is built on trust.

1047
00:59:47,297 --> 00:59:50,257
Why do you think I'm performing
in this LED skate park?

1048
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:53,177
I look ridiculous!

1049
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:55,972
Everything here is built on trust.

1050
00:59:56,053 --> 00:59:59,683
You trust me, I trust you.

1051
01:00:00,808 --> 01:00:02,768
That's why I locked up your phones.

1052
01:00:04,772 --> 01:00:06,232
I had to!

1053
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:08,817
I don't know you!

1054
01:00:09,318 --> 01:00:10,318
But I know you.

1055
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:14,323
And there's so many things that I think
and believe, but I'm too afraid to say.

1056
01:00:14,407 --> 01:00:16,575
But I have to trust you.

1057
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:19,493
-Can I trust you, Brooklyn?

1058
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,953
Can I really trust you?

1059
01:00:21,038 --> 01:00:24,042
All right, hear me out.
Fine, I'll say it.

1060
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:27,628
I know everybody likes Starbucks,

1061
01:00:27,712 --> 01:00:31,088
but I hate the fact that they have
a drink called Chai Tea!

1062
01:00:31,173 --> 01:00:32,758
Chai is tea!

1063
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:36,012
You're saying tea-tea, you dum-dum.

1064
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:39,432
"Hey, man, you want some naan bread?"

1065
01:00:39,515 --> 01:00:41,683
"Fuck you!"

1066
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:43,227
"Fuck."

1067
01:00:47,563 --> 01:00:49,858
Priyanka Chopra's wedding was fake.

1068
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:54,488
Why can't we say that?

1069
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:58,367
Who marries Nick Jonas unironically?

1070
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:03,872
Malala follows me on Instagram.

1071
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:07,708
And I don't follow her back!

1072
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:15,883
Two years ago, somebody asked me
my gender pronoun

1073
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:17,262
while I was in a meeting,

1074
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:19,263
and I got scared.

1075
01:01:19,347 --> 01:01:22,267
So I just said, "Me."

1076
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:32,150
I'm sorry!

1077
01:01:32,818 --> 01:01:34,570
But I am me!

1078
01:01:35,822 --> 01:01:37,573
And you are you!

1079
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:40,367
And this is us!

1080
01:01:41,285 --> 01:01:43,078
And I believe that.

1081
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:46,915
I believe it's unethical

1082
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:50,085
to use money that's not yours

1083
01:01:50,962 --> 01:01:52,922
to buy something that's not yours

1084
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:56,592
and then somehow make money
that is yours…

1085
01:01:57,758 --> 01:02:00,137
and then fuck over poor people
along the way.

1086
01:02:01,972 --> 01:02:03,932
So I go, "Sam, fine."

1087
01:02:05,558 --> 01:02:08,103
"I will take down the billboards."

1088
01:02:09,147 --> 01:02:12,858
"But what if I do a 30-minute deep dive
about how vulture funds are bad

1089
01:02:12,942 --> 01:02:15,818
and then I say the joke this way?"

1090
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,872
He goes, "Yeah…"

1091
01:02:29,123 --> 01:02:30,627
"That works."

1092
01:02:31,877 --> 01:02:34,003
Put up the episode!

1093
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,050
The next week,
I'm pushing baby girl in the stroller.

1094
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:42,053
Carlos sees me, he goes, "Hey, bro.
You got mail."

1095
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:44,388
I go, "Fuck you, Carlos,
you open the mail."

1096
01:02:44,473 --> 01:02:47,142
He rips it open, he's like,
"Aw, shit, you're being sued."

1097
01:02:47,227 --> 01:02:50,687
What? "Dear Mr. Minhaj, we are writing
on behalf of our client Randall Smith

1098
01:02:50,772 --> 01:02:54,567
regarding your 'comedy' show
<i>Patriot Act.</i>"

1099
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:56,610
I'm not even offended I'm being sued.

1100
01:02:56,693 --> 01:03:00,238
I'm offended they put "comedy" in quotes.

1101
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:01,865
Like I'm not a real comedian,

1102
01:03:01,948 --> 01:03:05,787
like, "Oh, this is my son, he's a 'DJ.'"

1103
01:03:07,828 --> 01:03:11,042
"Your 'show'…" It's a real show!

1104
01:03:11,123 --> 01:03:13,085
"…falsely accuses Mr. Smith
of being a pedophile."

1105
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:14,293
I never said that.

1106
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:18,548
"This letter constitutes a request for
retraction of the defamatory falsehoods."

1107
01:03:18,632 --> 01:03:20,843
"We look forward to hearing from you."

1108
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:23,887
I go, "Sam, you promised me,
all Americans are reasonable."

1109
01:03:23,972 --> 01:03:26,182
"I should trust them.
What the fuck do I do?"

1110
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:29,142
He goes, "Hasan, calm down.
Come to my office."

1111
01:03:29,227 --> 01:03:31,562
"I live for these moments."

1112
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:35,148
I get down to his office,
now the Adderall's hitting me.

1113
01:03:35,232 --> 01:03:36,900
But it's called cocaine.

1114
01:03:36,983 --> 01:03:40,528
Check it out!
"Dear Randall Smith & Counsel."

1115
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:43,115
"We are the legal team
for comedian Hasan Minhaj."

1116
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:46,285
I go, "No quotes! Nice, Sam!"

1117
01:03:46,368 --> 01:03:50,038
"Any defamation claim brought by
Mr. Smith would fail as a matter of law."

1118
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:53,125
"Allow me to explain to you

1119
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,168
the jurisprudence

1120
01:03:57,212 --> 01:03:58,255
of jokes."

1121
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:01,925
"First, <i>Patriot Act </i>is a comedy show."

1122
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:05,137
"Reasonable viewers understand
Minhaj peppers commentary with jokes,

1123
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,555
satire, parody."

1124
01:04:06,638 --> 01:04:10,852
"The second fatal flaw of your letter
is its inability to understand context."

1125
01:04:10,933 --> 01:04:14,313
"Mr. Minhaj delivers all his jokes
with eyes bugging, arms flailing."

1126
01:04:14,397 --> 01:04:17,023
"As you know, many people
have said Mr. Minhaj looks like a…

1127
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:21,487
raccoon on Adderall."

1128
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:24,448
Be reasonable.

1129
01:04:24,532 --> 01:04:26,908
"As you know, the Supreme Court
has ruled the audience…"

1130
01:04:26,992 --> 01:04:28,118
you…

1131
01:04:28,202 --> 01:04:29,703
you are no dullard.

1132
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:36,252
You can tell the difference
between satire and sincerity.

1133
01:04:36,335 --> 01:04:40,713
You know when I'm joking,
you know when I'm being serious.

1134
01:04:41,882 --> 01:04:43,175
DOs…

1135
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,845
I know you're good doctors.

1136
01:04:47,472 --> 01:04:49,557
But 86 likes is shitty!

1137
01:04:51,098 --> 01:04:54,520
"Finally, we suggest you rewatch
the episode you take issue with."

1138
01:04:54,603 --> 01:04:58,148
"If you would like Mr. Minhaj
to retract his statement and say,

1139
01:04:58,232 --> 01:05:03,028
'I am definitely not, <i>not </i>saying that
Randall Smith hearts pedophiles,'

1140
01:05:03,112 --> 01:05:05,197
please let us know."

1141
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:10,702
"We look forward to hearing from you."

1142
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:14,122
I go, "Sam,

1143
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,917
send that shit!"

1144
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:20,128
And guess what?

1145
01:05:20,797 --> 01:05:24,048
We never heard from
those assholes ever again.

1146
01:05:26,427 --> 01:05:29,097
I run back home to Beena,
I'm holding the letter.

1147
01:05:29,178 --> 01:05:32,392
I go, "Beena, babe, I was wrong."

1148
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,853
"Even though Sam
is a lawyer, he is funny."

1149
01:05:38,522 --> 01:05:40,357
"Frame this letter."

1150
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:43,485
And she looks at it and she goes,

1151
01:05:45,528 --> 01:05:47,113
"This is a good letter."

1152
01:05:49,448 --> 01:05:51,243
"But I'm not afraid of the good letters."

1153
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:54,788
"I'm afraid of the next bad letter."

1154
01:05:55,707 --> 01:05:57,708
"And the next letter after that."

1155
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:00,627
"That's why I worry."

1156
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:04,173
And I go, "I don't think
you have to worry anymore, babe."

1157
01:06:05,717 --> 01:06:07,968
"You know, you asked me a long time ago

1158
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:10,512
do I have a line?"

1159
01:06:11,805 --> 01:06:13,390
"Well, I know my line."

1160
01:06:14,892 --> 01:06:16,393
She goes, "Oh, yeah? What's that?"

1161
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:20,647
I go, "I'm only willing to take the joke

1162
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,983
as far as I possibly can,

1163
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:26,237
legally…

1164
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:29,990
up until the point

1165
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:33,410
that it hurts our family."

1166
01:06:34,537 --> 01:06:35,997
That's my line.

1167
01:06:37,788 --> 01:06:41,293
I've lost a lot of things in my life,
I cannot lose my family.

1168
01:06:43,087 --> 01:06:44,713
And she starts smiling.

1169
01:06:46,257 --> 01:06:48,092
And she squeezes my arm.

1170
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:52,262
And she goes, "Heyyyy!"

1171
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,942
Brooklyn, thank you so much.

1172
01:07:06,402 --> 01:07:07,737
Thank you.

1173
01:07:07,818 --> 01:07:10,030
Appreciate you guys.
Thank you so much.
