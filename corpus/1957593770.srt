(singer vocalizing)

21
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,017
- [Ruby] Chez Paree.

22
00:01:04,017 --> 00:01:05,893
This is the big time.

23
00:01:05,893 --> 00:01:06,916
- [Holly] Yeah.

24
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,844
- [Ruby] Ah, look at the cars!

25
00:01:08,844 --> 00:01:09,677
- [Holly] Wow.

26
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:10,939
- [Ruby] How about riding in style?

27
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:11,772
- [Holly] That's something.

28
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:12,855
- [Ruby] Wow.

29
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:18,034
Look at that woman's hat.
- Wow.

30
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:19,536
- That's not a hat.

31
00:01:19,536 --> 00:01:20,716
That's a dead chicken.

32
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:23,458
I would not be caught dead in that thing.

33
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,063
Look at that one.

34
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:30,063
That flare thing she's wearing
makes her look like a pear.

35
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,544
What kind of fur is that?

36
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:33,377
Skunk?

37
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:36,339
- The cute guy with her though.

38
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:38,959
- Yeah, bet he's rich.

39
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,292
Sure got off cheap with old Pepe Le Pew.

40
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:44,538
Wow.

41
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,391
Look at that turquoise dress.

42
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:47,755
- [Holly] Jeez Louise.

43
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:49,210
- This is so much better

44
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,263
than the crud outside the
Black Orchid last night.

45
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:52,140
- It doesn't even compare.

46
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,713
- Or two nights ago outside the Cloisters.

47
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:56,092
Ugh, please.

48
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:57,977
- Oh, that black dress.

49
00:01:57,977 --> 00:01:59,810
That's the one I want.

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,624
- That's too plain.

51
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,775
- I think it's classy.

52
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:06,608
Oh.

53
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:09,108
(grand music)

54
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:17,362
(crowd applauding and cheering)

55
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:40,140
- [Ruby] You've got a thing in your teeth.

56
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,190
- Oh. (gasping)

57
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,640
- Right there between the
middle one and the other one.

58
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
No, hold on, let me see.

59
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:48,321
Mhmm, all right.

60
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:51,713
Let's go.

61
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,546
We gotta get up for work tomorrow.

62
00:02:57,263 --> 00:03:00,846
(sewing machines whirring)

63
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:13,711
- Don't do it, Ruby.

64
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:18,044
- You can't get ahead,
Betty, if you don't even try.

65
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:21,535
(door knocking)

66
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,368
- Come in.

67
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:24,126
- Mr. Cage?

68
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:26,755
Sir.
- Yes?

69
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:30,365
- I was just thinking about our...

70
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:32,115
I mean, your dresses.

71
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,203
- Ah, it's good to know you girls

72
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:36,403
are thinking about your job.

73
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:37,756
- Sir, I was just wondering If I can-

74
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:39,294
- Can't this wait until tomorrow?

75
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:41,163
My wife has a roast on Wednesday.

76
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:42,382
And she'll kill me if I'm a second late.

77
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:44,165
- This will only take a second.

78
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:46,352
(light kooky music)

79
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,467
I was thinking that if we were to add

80
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:51,360
a couple of darks down here
by the waist like this,

81
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,932
it would turn this drab
Wednesday house dress

82
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:56,246
into "Look out ladies, here I come!"

83
00:03:56,246 --> 00:04:00,096
I mean do you see how
it would emphasize her,

84
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:01,650
you know?

85
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,949
- Today's housewife is
looking for comfort.

86
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,832
- It would still be comfortable.

87
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:08,339
But she wants to look good too.

88
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:09,172
- Why?

89
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:12,320
- For the plumber.

90
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,192
- Plumber?

91
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,787
- And for herself while she's cleaning up

92
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,173
around the house.

93
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,957
- While she's vacuuming
and doing the dishes

94
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,021
and scrubbing the toilets?

95
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,437
- Yes!

96
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:23,075
I mean what better time to feel attractive

97
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:24,235
than when you're doing things

98
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:26,851
that make you feel so unattractive?

99
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:30,397
Mr. Cage, if we can
make a flattering dress

100
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:33,933
with the same price as
an unflattering dress,

101
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,508
then we will sell more dresses-

102
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:37,549
- What is she doing?

103
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:38,991
- To more women who will feel better

104
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:40,092
about wearing the dresses we make

105
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:44,357
and we will feel better about making them!

106
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:46,019
- How much time did this take?

107
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,760
(somber piano music)

108
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,146
- I just spent a little time today.

109
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:53,282
- How many hours did you spend
on this dress this afternoon?

110
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:54,290
- Not much.

111
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,623
- You didn't do any work today, did you?

112
00:04:58,765 --> 00:04:59,848
You're fired.

113
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:02,799
Clean out your locker.

114
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:05,899
- [Ruby] Bye.

115
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:08,128
- [Man] All right, Jordan
locks up the truck.

116
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:08,971
- Well?

117
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:10,470
Did he like it?

118
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,637
- Not exactly.

119
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:14,790
- What does he know anyway?

120
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,540
Wait, Ruby, what's the big hurry?

121
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,271
My God, you stole those!

122
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:23,104
- Shh!

123
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:24,708
They're just fabric samples.

124
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,129
- Well what if you get caught?

125
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,499
- I won't get caught.

126
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:30,773
- Well if you do, you're gonna be fired.

127
00:05:30,773 --> 00:05:31,718
- I am fired.

128
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:33,230
- You're fired?

129
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,813
- Housecleaning, assembly line,

130
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:40,138
laundromat, Playboy Bunny tryouts.

131
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:42,607
- Shh.

132
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:44,054
- Look at that outfit!

133
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:46,252
Come way up in the leg like that?

134
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:49,445
Makes her legs like 10
feet long, it's genius.

135
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:50,722
- I wouldn't wear it.

136
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,732
Look at the waist all
squeezed in like that.

137
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:54,502
- Come on, she looks like a million.

138
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:57,173
(energetic music)

139
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,345
♪ My what a baby, ooh yeah ♪

140
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:00,790
- You would look great in it.

141
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,867
- Who wouldn't?

142
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,617
Okay, listen to this.

143
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:07,995
♪ Big bunny, oh yeah ♪

144
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,163
- You'll meet internationally
famous people.

145
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:12,996
- Hah!

146
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:15,872
- Obviously you've never
seen a Playboy Magazine.

147
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:17,232
- It's not the same thing.

148
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:18,990
This is a waitressing thing.

149
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,854
- With almost no clothes on.

150
00:06:20,854 --> 00:06:21,687
- So what?

151
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:25,292
(bus hissing)

152
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:28,184
- Probably too flat-chested anyway.

153
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:31,394
- (laughing) Oh my god.

154
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:32,284
- Can you believe it?

155
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:33,784
- That was so bad.

156
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:35,966
- If I want men to ogle me,

157
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:37,933
I can just stay at my own job, okay?

158
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,279
End of conversation.

159
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,050
- Okey-dokey.

160
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,082
You know what I'm
thinking about right now?

161
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:46,069
Two front row center
stage seats at Chez Paree.

162
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:47,070
- Ruby!
- What?

163
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,925
I'm just thinking out loud.

164
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:50,392
- Loud enough so I can hear you.

165
00:06:50,392 --> 00:06:51,901
- Fine.

166
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:53,795
It's just that if we took this little job,

167
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:55,940
I can maybe get enough money together

168
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,494
to start my own business.

169
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:58,777
So can you!

170
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:00,475
- You're the one with the dream.

171
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:03,851
I prefer to wear clothes to work.

172
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:05,355
- You are such a prude.

173
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:06,188
(audience laughing)

174
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:07,118
- [Man] Why did the
chicken cross the road?

175
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:08,495
- [Man 2] How should I know?

176
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:12,078
- You know, this would
look so good on you.

177
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,099
I'm doing it in your favorite color.

178
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:17,394
Very chic.

179
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,208
- [Man 2] Don't you belittle me, mister.

180
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,958
- Don't you think she
kind of looks like you?

181
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:25,616
Man, you know what,

182
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:27,531
I don't even know why I bother anyway

183
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,388
if we can't afford to go anywhere.

184
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:31,721
- Would you stop it, please?

185
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:37,128
(TV audience laughing)

186
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:39,162
- Yeah, well it's great
doing business with you.

187
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:42,318
At Hellman's, we aim to please. (laughing)

188
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:43,791
- Hundred feet of piping,

189
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,591
you get a free hot seat.

190
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,791
Okay.

191
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,374
Thank you, bye bye.

192
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,888
- (laughing) After while, crocodile.

193
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,250
Come on, come on in.

194
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,604
The door is always open.

195
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:03,622
- I was just on my way home, Mr. Hellman.

196
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:05,455
- Such a polite thing.

197
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,183
I keep telling you, call me Norm.

198
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:10,436
- Well, I was just wondering.

199
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:12,532
It's the first of the month, and-

200
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:13,365
- And?

201
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,440
- My parents, they count on me for help.

202
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,348
They're having some financial-

203
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:20,848
- Oh, say no more.

204
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:25,073
I forgot a little something, didn't I?

205
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:34,046
(chuckling) Come on, come on in.

206
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:37,546
I don't bite. (chuckling)

207
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,958
Ah, now where did I put that checkbook?

208
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:48,002
It's here somewhere.

209
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:51,981
Be a doll, look on the
shelf over there, will you?

210
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:53,986
I know it's around here somewhere.

211
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:56,486
(light music)

212
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:00,132
It's up here.

213
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:07,226
- Sorry, I'm in your way.

214
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:08,143
Here it is.

215
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:09,982
- Oh.

216
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:13,217
How silly is that?

217
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:16,165
(chuckling)

218
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:16,998
Good eyes.

219
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:19,821
So,

220
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,145
what do you say I

221
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:28,077
take you out for a
sandwich or something, hmm?

222
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:31,327
- If you don't mind, I sort
of have a bad headache.

223
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,066
- Hey, Uncle Normie knows

224
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:35,733
how to get rid of bad headaches.

225
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:39,734
- Good night, Mr. Hellman.

226
00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:45,743

00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:54,218

239
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:15,156
- Work, you stupid piece of crap!

240
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:17,387
Ugh!

241
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:20,468
Hey.

242
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:21,301
- Hey.

- Ugh, food, thank God!

244
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:28,846
My stomach has been growling for hours.

245

- I thought you said you
were gonna clean this up?

246
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,734
- I'm so tired.

247
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:34,651
- Not too tired to sew.

248
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:39,227
- Uh-oh, he did it again, didn't he?

249
00:10:39,227 --> 00:10:41,628
Holly, you gotta quit that job.

250
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:44,795
- Right, then we'd both be unemployed.

251
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:48,639
What are you doing?

252
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:51,436
I thought we agreed.

253
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,263
- Hmm?

254
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:56,195
- One stick per person per day.

255
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:58,072
- I'm hungry.

256
00:10:58,072 --> 00:10:59,386
- Give it back.

257
00:10:59,386 --> 00:11:00,444
- So I'll skip a day.

258
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:02,351
- Don't push me, Ruby.

259
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:03,184
Give it.

260
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:07,508
- I'm getting licorice if I want.

261
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:08,341
- Ruby!

262
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,174
- Uh-uh.

263
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:10,007
Uh, look at that.

264
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:10,840
- Give it to me!

265
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,173
- Don't pull it.

266
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:14,732
Ah, ooh!

267
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:17,920
(both grunting)

268
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,337
Oh man.
- Come on!

269
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:21,634
- Look at this.

270
00:11:21,634 --> 00:11:23,638
- [Holly] You go ahead.

271
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:26,305
(both grunting)

272
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:32,652
(both laughing)

273
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:35,152
(light music)

274
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:40,553
- What are we doing?

275
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:41,803
- I don't know.

276
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:45,059
- We should take the job.

277
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:51,724
Come on, Holly, what do you say?

278
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:55,108
- Will we have to tell our folks?

279
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:57,150
I can't believe we're doing this.

280
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,447
- Just think about old Uncle Normie

281
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:01,451
making your headache go away.

282
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:03,106
- Okay, I'm walking, I'm walking.

283
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:05,937
- Me, I am thinking about a
ruby rare steak, blood running,

284
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:09,022
and a baked potato with so much
sour cream, it's like soup.

285
00:12:09,022 --> 00:12:10,878
- The Norm thing works better for me.

286
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:12,379
I can't do this.

287
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:13,212
- Go!

288
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:16,691
Come on, let's make it happen.

289
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:21,691
(light lounge music)
(all chattering)

290
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,824
- Oh, I think I'm gonna upchuck.

291
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:26,657
- Come on.

292
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:30,388
(ladies laughing)

293
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:32,334
- [Waitress] All right,
gentlemen, surf and turf

294
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,983
and a steak?

295
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:35,524
- [Man] Wow, and dope, it looks great.

296
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:36,772
- [Man 2] Yeah, thank you dear.

297
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,772
- [Hostess] Are you here to audition?

298
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:41,329
- You could tell?

299
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:42,687
We look that nervous?

300
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:45,631
- Well, women are only allowed
as guests of keyholders.

301
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:46,631
- Oh, right.

302
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:50,388
We knew that.

303
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:51,751
- Across the room to the back,

304
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:54,423
down the stairs and to your right.

305
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:57,090
Relax, you're making me nervous.

306
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,369
- Okay, Holly, shoulders back, chest up.

307
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:02,821
God wouldn't give you that body

308
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:05,088
if he wanted you to be ashamed of it.

309
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:07,476
- You sound like a pimp!

310
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:09,185
- Leave it to cleavage.

311

346

- Tennessee originally,
by way of Kentucky.

347
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:43,910
- Columbus, Ohio.

348
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:47,782
I was Miss Jamboree.

That's in Missouri.

351
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:53,460
It's the Show Me State.

352
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,938
- Mostly ride on floats
and wave to the folks.

353
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,920
- I won the blue ribbon
for sheep shearing.

354
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,461
- Harry S. Truman was
born in Independence.

355

We're independently minded.

356
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:08,831
- One time I fell on the
float and my crown fell off.

357
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:12,853
And this man Jimmy's tractor ran it over.

358
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:15,016

359
00:15:15,016 --> 00:15:17,597
I was even considering this.

360
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:18,962

00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:22,250
Well, I have a lot of experience

362

In fact, I was thinking,

I don't know, update the bunny costumes.

365
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:30,733
So many ideas.

366
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:32,520
Bold, abstract prints?

367
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,834
Leopard print bunnies.

368
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,253
Can't you just see that?

369
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:37,044
I was born for this job,
when it comes to ideas.

370
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:42,044
If maybe you ever wanted
help, you know, fashion-wise,

371
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:43,248
I could take you shopping.

372
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:44,131
I could.

373
00:15:44,131 --> 00:15:45,952
I would be willing to do that

374
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:49,019
and you know, maybe take
you to get a new do.

375
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,792
I mean, the only reason I ask.

376
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:53,092
I like your hair, really.

377
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,136
It's very vibrant.

378
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:55,742
Not that I don't like it, but it looks...

379
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:56,753
Ladies about your age...

380
00:15:56,753 --> 00:16:00,329
I mean you must have to have
that processed all the time.

381
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:02,246
So, where do I sign up?

382
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:06,130
- Holly Tanner.

383
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,345
- Holly.

384
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:08,764
You don't hear that name much.

385
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:10,659
- I was born at Christmas.

386
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,242
- Oh, that's sweet.

387
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:16,193
It's okay.

388
00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:17,276
I won't bite.

389
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:22,670
Well, you're certainly pretty enough.

390
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,920
- Well, thanks.

391
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:26,420
- What's the matter?

392
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,705
People don't tell you that often?

393
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:29,538
- No.

394
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:34,301
- Do you always wear so little makeup?

395
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:35,724
- Oh.

396
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:36,904
- I'm just curious.

397
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:37,737
It's okay.

398
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,159
So you're new to town, huh?

399
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,201
Near the top of your class.

400
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:45,324
No college?

401
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:46,841
- Well my folks couldn't
afford to send us both

402
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,826
and my sister, she's really smart

403
00:16:48,826 --> 00:16:50,659
so I wanted her to go.

404
00:16:56,954 --> 00:16:59,822
- So why do you think
you want to be a bunny?

405
00:16:59,822 --> 00:17:00,655
- The truth?

406
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:01,488
- Hmm.

407
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,756
- I think genetically,

408
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:07,095
I have a really nicely
shaped head for bunny ears.

409
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:09,441
- I had a bunny once
when I was a little girl.

410
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:11,211
His name was Bobo.

411
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:14,500
Jimmy's tractor ran that over too.

412
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,333
- Oh.

413
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:19,019
- For the money?

414
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:21,409
- Nothing wrong with that.

415
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:23,154
It's better to be honest.

416
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:25,652
Do you have any waitress experience?

417
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:27,612
- Ruby and I, she's the one you just met.

418
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:28,866
- Oh yeah.

419
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:31,668
- We worked at the Dairylicious.

420
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:32,795
Well, that's about it.

421
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:35,154
- Well I think we should
take this to the next step.

422
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,994
How would you feel about our
taking some photographs of you?

423
00:17:37,994 --> 00:17:39,856
- Oh, I didn't bring my own suit.

424
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:40,689
- Oh, that's okay.

425
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:42,828
We'd like to see you in the real thing.

426
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,661
- Really?

427
00:17:44,724 --> 00:17:46,042
- Is that a problem?

428
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,573
- Well no, it's just that,

429
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:50,161
Ruby, she really wants to work here and

430
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:52,185
if you were to say, hire me and not her?

431
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:55,699
- I'm sorry, but you're the
one who's bunny material.

432
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,513
- I can't take this job if Ruby doesn't.

433
00:17:58,513 --> 00:18:01,518
She's really smart and talented, and...

434
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:02,708
Oh and she's so strong.

435
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,119
You should see her play softball.

436
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,297
Not that that's what we do here, but,

437
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:07,444
if you had things,

438
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:08,896
like those trays, they look really heavy.

439
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:11,555
Ruby, she could carry those, no problem.

440
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:12,782
Just-
- Does she stick up for you

441
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:15,871
as much as you stick up for her?

442
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:18,076
- Ruby would do anything for me.

443
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:19,413
For anybody.

444
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:21,151
People really like her.

445
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:23,734
(upbeat music)

446
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,121
- Right this way.

447
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:29,954
Oh, Judy.

448
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:32,135
A little bit more.

449
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:33,204
Amanda, brighter lipstick.

450
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:35,538
- Mmm, you like that bleu cheese,

451
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:37,479
don't you, Kelsey? (snorting)

452
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,071
Come on, Michelle, you're up.

453
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:40,772
- Thelma, I've got two auditions here!

454
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:42,261
- Hold your horses, Seabiscuit!

455
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:45,142
Who else is gonna weigh these porkers?

456
00:18:45,142 --> 00:18:47,828
- It's like backstage at the Rockettes!

457
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:49,578
This is the big time.

458
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:52,785
- It sure is.

459
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:55,896
- All right, girls, over here.

460
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:57,011
All right.

461
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,428
You try this one.

462
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,273
And you-

463
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:04,225
- I know, black is really my color,

464
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:06,785
in bathing suits and bunny outfits.

465
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:08,590
- You have to graduate to black.

466
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,804
Black is for top bunnies only.

467
00:19:10,804 --> 00:19:12,686
All right, here.

468
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:14,206
This one'll fit you.

469
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:15,383
- Hey, hey, hey.

470
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:17,209
What are you, decorating a Christmas tree?

471
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:19,079
Leave the bunny design to the expert.

472
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,474
- I thought red for Ruby, that's her name.

473
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:24,193
- Oh, red for Ruby, isn't that sweet?

474
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:25,275
Green.

475
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:26,452
Red would be a cliche.

476
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:27,285
- Green's fine.

477
00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:28,850
I wouldn't wanna step
on your toes, Thelma.

478
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,215
- Watch it, bean pole.

479
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:31,465
- Is pink okay?

480
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:33,825
- Yeah, sure, I'm easy.

481
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:34,658
Stick with me, honey.

482
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:37,991
I'll make you look like a million bucks.

483
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,543
Hey.

484
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:42,760
Rabbits for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

485
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,468
No wonder I'm just a hop, skip and jump

486
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:46,631
away from the looney bin.

487
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:47,895
Here.

488
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,228
Hey, Goldilocks!

489
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:52,735
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

490
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:53,733
You're a mess!

491
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:56,434
- You can change over there.

492
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:58,792
- Is there a curtain or something?

493
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,810
- You better get used to it.

494
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,018
(gasping) Natalie.

495
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:03,741
Your ears are crooked.

496
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:04,934
- I can't do this.

497
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:05,959
- What about me?

498
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,674
I stuffed my brassiere!

499
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,591
- Girls, get a move on.

500
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,440
- All right ladies, listen up.

501
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,197
Baby bunnies on the floor,

502
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:18,197
so remember, no peeking.

503
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,971
Now, girls, you won't have to worry

504
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,829
about being naked in front
of total strangers anymore,

505
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,158
because after today,

506
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,158
we won't be total strangers.

507
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:31,241
(upbeat jazz music)

508
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:32,572
- Okay.

509
00:20:32,572 --> 00:20:34,989
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

510
00:20:36,718 --> 00:20:37,971
(Ruby exclaiming)

511
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:38,938
(Holly gasping)

512
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,735
- You know, the last girl I corseted up,

513
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:44,818
two broken ribs and a punctured lung.

514
00:20:45,755 --> 00:20:46,860
- Oh, gosh.

515
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,341
- I'm kidding.

516
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:49,738
Only one cracked rib.

517
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:51,747
Hairline thin, nothing to worry about.

518
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:53,336
- It's a little hard to breathe at first

519
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,077
but you get used to it.

520
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:56,587
All right, turn around.

521
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:57,420
Let's see.

522
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,257
Hmm. (Thelma gasping)

523
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,833
- Oh my god, we gotta give
this girl some bazooms.

524
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,666
Here.

525
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,716
Barbie socks, they're clean, stuff.

526
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:05,549
Go on.

527
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:08,073
You ever see Jane Mansfield?

528
00:21:08,073 --> 00:21:08,906
- Yeah.

529
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:10,867
- Well, her you're not
and you never will be.

530
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:13,327
Go on, down the sides and on the bottom.

531
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:14,886
In and up, in and up.

532
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:15,830
Come on, come on!

533
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,159
- Just let them lay on top.

534
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,487
That'll do the job nicely.

535
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:19,320
- Go on, stuff.

536
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,428
Go on, girly.

537
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:23,079
Ah, check, two torpedoes in the hole.

538
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:26,631
Who said the army cornered
the market on rockets, huh?

539
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:27,567
Doris!

540
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:29,948
What's with the droopy drawers?

541
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:32,448
(jazzy music)

542
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:35,912
- Oh!

543
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,420
Damn, we look good.

544
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:42,771
Woo! (giggling)

545
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:45,156
Go on, Holly, give it a little shake.

546
00:21:45,156 --> 00:21:46,183
- No.

547
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:48,200
- Come on, please?

548
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,283
Spin around or something.

549
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,290
You look great, you really do.

550

(grand orchestral music)

551
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:09,669
Like a million bucks.

552
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:11,501

- Woohoo!

570
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:17,464
Hello, I'm your bunny Ruby.

571
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,264
- And I'm your bunny Holly.

572
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,315
Oh no.

573
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,148
- What?

574
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:23,325
- Bunny Holly, Buddy Holly?

575
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:24,726
Buddy Holly, Bunny Holly?

576
00:23:24,726 --> 00:23:26,029
- No one will ever think of that

577
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,905
in a million years but you.

578
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:29,738
Hi there.

579
00:23:29,738 --> 00:23:30,571
- Mmm.
- Hah!

580
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:31,835
I cannot wait to go tell my boss

581
00:23:31,835 --> 00:23:33,237
to jump in a lake.

582
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:34,325
- He already fired you.

583
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,485
- Let's not drudge up the past, okay?

584
00:23:36,485 --> 00:23:37,357
Let's celebrate.

585
00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:39,354
Oh my gosh, look at this!

586
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:41,642
That's me in six months.

587
00:23:41,642 --> 00:23:43,475
And that, that is you.

588
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:47,304
I am gonna buy a mink stole too,

589
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:49,435
five evening gowns, a pair of shoes

590
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:51,352
for every outfit I own!

591
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:53,411

00:23:57,527 --> 00:23:58,360
- [Sportscaster] Bottom of the ninth here,

595
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,520
Laroux steps in, the
last chance for his club.

596
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,437
Two men on and two out.

597
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:04,467
(bell dinging)

598
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:05,300
There's a slight breeze
blowing on right field.

599
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,133
- Come on.

600
00:24:07,638 --> 00:24:08,767
I'm starving, hello.
- If he can get a hold

601
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,993
of one at Mike Carey if he
can set up in the bridge.

602
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:13,151
- Mhmmm, you have no idea

603
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,818
how much we're gonna enjoy this!

604
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:18,575
- [Sportscaster] Knocks
the dirt out of his spikes.

605
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:19,635
- Mmm.

606
00:24:19,635 --> 00:24:20,802
Mmmm.
- Oh, mm!

607
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,005
- Oh.

608
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,672
(both laughing)

609
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,207
- Sorry.

610
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:33,242
We just got out of prison.

611
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:35,849
- May I borrow your salt and pepper?

612
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,362
Thanks.

613
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:39,029
- Let's go over it again.

614
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:40,885
- Merit demerit schedule.

615
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:41,780
- Horseradish.

616
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,016
Hello?

617
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:44,933
Right there, excuse me.

618
00:24:47,858 --> 00:24:49,688
- Merit demerit schedule.

619
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,540
A bunny who earns a hundred merits

620
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,862
is awarded the sum of 25 dollars.

621
00:24:53,862 --> 00:24:55,832
A bunny who gets a hundred demerits

622
00:24:55,832 --> 00:24:57,723
is dismissed from the Playboy Club.

623
00:24:57,723 --> 00:24:59,743
- Wow, that's harsh.

624
00:24:59,743 --> 00:25:00,801
- Ketchup.

625
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:01,634
- Ketchup!

626
00:25:02,557 --> 00:25:05,307
The girl needs ketchup down here?

627
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,479
Thank you.

628
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:10,443
- Merits cancel out demerits

629
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:12,642
at the rate of one merit
for every one demerit.

630
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:14,912
- Steak sauce, hi.

631
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:16,912
It is a steak, you know?

632
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:25,169
- Chewing gum in front of
a customer, 10 demerits.

633
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:26,503
- A bunny must present herself

634
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:31,003
in the most pleasing and
professional manner possible.

635
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:35,632
Chives, I need chives so bad.

636
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:39,477
Come on.

637
00:25:39,477 --> 00:25:40,727
Thanks so much.

638
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:43,617
What-didididi, stop, stop.

639
00:25:43,617 --> 00:25:45,180
Little bit here.

640
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,464
Okay, whoa whoa whoa, tututut!

641
00:25:46,464 --> 00:25:48,086
Stop when I say stop.

642
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:49,919
- That's what you get.

643
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:54,106
- Calling in your drink order.

644
00:25:54,106 --> 00:25:55,255
(Holly slurping)

645
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:56,890
Hello?

646
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,807
Can we get two more of this please?

647
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:02,187
- You know what?

648
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:03,723
Do you have a dessert menu?

649
00:26:03,723 --> 00:26:04,556
(bat whacking)

650
00:26:04,556 --> 00:26:05,389
- [Announcer] And it's deep!

651
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:08,139
(crowd cheering)

652
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:14,748
- I have got to have a piece of pie

653
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:16,471
or I will die.

654
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:17,932
- I am Miranda Montel

655
00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:19,809
and I will be your bunny mother.

656
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:22,892
Your teacher, your boss, your friend.

657
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:27,933
In the tradition of the
famous Ziegfield Follies girl,

658
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:29,709
the bunny has become the quintessence

659
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,693
of the American female.

660
00:26:31,693 --> 00:26:34,245
Today, bunny is the synonym

661
00:26:34,245 --> 00:26:38,684
for the beautiful,
glamorous, elegant ladies

662
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,986
you will all become.

663
00:26:40,986 --> 00:26:44,303
As a bunny, you have
joined a company of girls

664
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,674
who with good reason,

665
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:49,257
are both respected and admired.

666
00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:53,090
As a bunny once said,

667
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,135
you are holding the top job in America

668
00:26:56,135 --> 00:26:58,809
for a young girl today.

669
00:26:58,809 --> 00:26:59,892
So, chins up.

670
00:27:03,575 --> 00:27:05,825
Stand tall and let's begin!

671
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:09,881
The bunny stance.

672
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:12,881

It's all about presentation.

683

Present the bunny image.

684
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:40,618
If you are right-handed...

685
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:41,451
Warm.

686
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,471
Your left leg goes forward.

687
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:43,474
Lovely.

688
00:27:43,474 --> 00:27:44,471
You arch your back.

689
00:27:44,471 --> 00:27:45,304
Bright.

690
00:27:45,304 --> 00:27:46,156
Tuck in your hips.

691
00:27:46,156 --> 00:27:47,173
And friendly.

692
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:49,010
- Friendly.
- Come on, write this down.

693
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,237
The bunny dip.

694
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:51,431
The Playboy Club keys.

695
00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:52,992
You roll your shoulder back.

696
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:54,116
The initial key.

697
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:55,984
And lock your elbow into your hip bone.

698
00:27:55,984 --> 00:27:59,145
And the very special C-1 keyholders

699
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,312
are friends of Mr. Hefner.

700
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,629

701
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:07,048
- Always point your tail

00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:52,135
She's copying us.

717

(both clapping)

718
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:57,955
- Thank you. (laughing)

719
00:28:57,955 --> 00:28:58,788
- Okay.

720
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:01,140
How do I look?

721
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:05,144
- If we leave it there,
it'll turn into a cocoon.

722
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:06,824
- Oh gosh, help.

723
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:07,991
- [Ruby] Okay.

724
00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:12,864
- [Holly] Thanks.

725
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:15,043
- Tub of lard.

726
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:16,944
You better lay off the mashed potatoes

727
00:29:16,944 --> 00:29:18,680
or they're gonna throw you overboard

728
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,763
and use you as an anchor.

729
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,683
- I gained another pound.

730
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,307
- What are those?

731
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:29,501
- Diet pills.

732
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,464
When you eat like I
do, you need the pills.

733
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:34,964
- Okay Hollywood, you're next.

734
00:29:37,888 --> 00:29:39,866
- I ate a big meal last night.

735
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:40,699
- Oh yeah?

736
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:41,532
Let me guess.

737
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:42,694
You splurged and you had two grapes

738
00:29:42,694 --> 00:29:44,152

739
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:49,152
(upbeat music)
(girls chattering)

740
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:55,048
- What do we do again
if someone gets fresh?

741
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:57,430
- [Girls] Gentlemen, you're not allowed

742
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,954
to touch the bunnies.

743
00:29:59,954 --> 00:30:00,976
- And that works?

744
00:30:00,976 --> 00:30:03,495
What if they don't pay
attention to the rules?

745
00:30:03,495 --> 00:30:05,469
- Oh baby, with this ridiculous costume

746
00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:07,232
comes a lot of power.

747
00:30:07,232 --> 00:30:09,595
All you have to do is learn how to use it.

748
00:30:09,595 --> 00:30:12,069
If that doesn't work,
well then there's always,

749
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:12,902
Ben!

750
00:30:17,664 --> 00:30:21,693
Oh, Ben, I'm sorry, I thought
I had a run, but okay.

751
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:22,526
Thanks.

752
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:25,860
- Okay, Evie, you're in the showroom.

753
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,077
And Judy, Denise and Nancy,
you're in the lounge.

754
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:30,910
Come on.

755
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:33,406
- Come on, girls.

756
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:35,207
- [Ruby] See, we'll be fine.

757
00:30:35,207 --> 00:30:36,714
- She seems nice.

758
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:38,834
- Oh and she's real smart too.

759
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:39,898
Hey Evie, what's that word of yours

760
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:42,031
that I like so much?

761
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:43,250
- Zygote.

762
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,061
- Zygote, dammit, sounds so smart.

763
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:46,415
I wish I could figure out a way

764
00:30:46,415 --> 00:30:47,658
to use them on customers, like,

765
00:30:47,658 --> 00:30:51,167
that martini reminds
me so much of a zygote.

766
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:52,000
(Evie laughing)

767
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,330
- [Woman] I can't believe it!

768
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,413
- [Bunny] What?

769
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:57,330
- What happened to her?

770
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,487
- Too many demerits.

771
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:01,693

772
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,810

(upbeat music)

1097
00:47:15,244 --> 00:47:17,340
- Bunny bowling.

1098
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,114
- Do we have to pay extra for this?

1099
00:47:20,114 --> 00:47:21,431

- Just five more minutes.

1106
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:42,307
Jack Lalaine says that's all it takes

1107
00:47:42,307 --> 00:47:45,411
to redistribute your weight.

1108
00:47:45,411 --> 00:47:49,494
- You've been sitting in
that sauna huh, not bad.

1109
00:47:54,696 --> 00:47:56,026
- Ruby, you're late again.

1110
00:47:56,026 --> 00:47:59,035
- I know, but you covered
for me, didn't you?

1111
00:47:59,035 --> 00:48:01,122
James just wouldn't let me go.

1112
00:48:01,122 --> 00:48:03,934
- Hey Olive Oyl, come on.

1113
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:04,767
Come on.

1114
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:07,533
Come on, I ain't gonna bite you.

1115
00:48:07,533 --> 00:48:11,450
Let's see if you can even
get the dial to move.

1116
00:48:12,581 --> 00:48:13,748
Another pound.

1117
00:48:14,605 --> 00:48:15,688
That's seven.

1118
00:48:16,931 --> 00:48:19,597
I'd say you're losing a pound a week.

1119
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:21,096
Let me guess, you're dressing up

1120
00:48:21,096 --> 00:48:23,405

1121
00:48:23,405 --> 00:48:25,701
- I just haven't felt very well lately.

1122

- Yeah, me either.

1123
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:27,612
- [Newscaster] In Alabama today,

1124
00:48:27,612 --> 00:48:31,740
the 21st of November,
1961, the unrest continues.

1125
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,005
Riots broke out early this morning

1126
00:48:34,005 --> 00:48:37,218
in response to the latest
freedom riot into Birmingham.

1127
00:48:37,218 --> 00:48:39,960
Several negro residents
were severely beaten.

1128
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,452
Attempts to force the
desegregation of a state

1129
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:45,059
that is so far refusing
to grant negroes equality

1130
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:48,696
has led to repeated bouts
of violence and bloodshed.

1131
00:48:48,696 --> 00:48:51,446
(radio clacking)

1132
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:57,589
- Prayers for your family, honey.

1133
00:49:01,885 --> 00:49:03,802
- Georgia, Ruby, Holly.

1134
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:06,840
Oh, hell, any of you that
don't have anywhere to go

1135
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,117
for Thanksgiving, you're all
welcome to come to my house.

1136
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,641
Ray and I are making a turkey.
- Aw!

1137
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:13,958
- Except you, fella.

1138
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:15,466
- Well, that's okay by me

1139
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:17,363
because I got a date.

1140
00:49:17,363 --> 00:49:18,196
- Woo!

1141
00:49:18,196 --> 00:49:21,396
(girls cheering)

1142
00:49:21,396 --> 00:49:23,002
- He's loaded and I ain't bringing him

1143
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,807

1144
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:25,735
(everyone laughing)

1145
00:49:25,735 --> 00:49:26,818
- Oh my gosh.

1146
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,231
So then, Holly goes up to this guy

1147
00:49:30,231 --> 00:49:32,514
and she says to the drunk,

1148
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:34,515
"Hello, I'm your Bunny Holly."

1149
00:49:34,515 --> 00:49:35,348
- I swear.

1150
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:37,455
- And he puts his hand on her thigh

1151
00:49:37,455 --> 00:49:40,669
and he says "Hold on out, honey,

1152
00:49:40,669 --> 00:49:43,115
I can only talk to one of you at a time."

1153
00:49:43,115 --> 00:49:46,115
(everyone laughing)

1154
00:49:48,531 --> 00:49:50,714
- [Woman] You remember the guy
who always had an erection?

1155
00:49:50,714 --> 00:49:52,507
- Oh my god.
- No, no, no, oh.

1156
00:49:52,507 --> 00:49:53,746
- He couldn't order a drink

1157
00:49:53,746 --> 00:49:55,273
without getting a total teepee.

1158
00:49:55,273 --> 00:49:57,146
- [Ruby] What was his name?

1159
00:49:57,146 --> 00:49:59,571
- Oh I don't know what his name was.

1160
00:49:59,571 --> 00:50:01,981
- I think it was something like Weiner?

1161
00:50:01,981 --> 00:50:05,728
- No, no, no, no, Woody! (all laughing)

1162
00:50:05,728 --> 00:50:08,116
- No, darlings, it was Jonesy.

1163
00:50:08,116 --> 00:50:10,399
(Evie laughing)

1164
00:50:10,399 --> 00:50:11,977
- Did you serve him, Evie?
- It was so bad.

1165
00:50:11,977 --> 00:50:12,810
- What?

1166
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:15,345
- Did you serve?

1167
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,473
- Oh, Ray, don't be so serious.

1168
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,390
- No, Evie.

1169
00:50:19,557 --> 00:50:20,640
I wanna know.

1170
00:50:22,294 --> 00:50:23,794
Did you serve him?

1171
00:50:25,633 --> 00:50:28,133
- Ray, relax, he was harmless.

1172
00:50:32,954 --> 00:50:33,954
- Excuse me.

1173
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:37,118
- [Evie] Ray!

1174
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,639
(sighing) Excuse me.

1175
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:39,472
Ray!

1176
00:50:40,606 --> 00:50:41,439
Ray.

1177
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:44,135
Ray.
- What?

1178
00:50:44,135 --> 00:50:45,051
- What are you doing?

1179
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:45,928
- What am I doing?

1180
00:50:45,928 --> 00:50:46,761
I can't handle this anymore.

1181
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:47,854
And I can't just sit
there and listen to you

1182
00:50:47,854 --> 00:50:49,175
talk like that to your friends!

1183
00:50:49,175 --> 00:50:50,235
- What are you talking about?

1184
00:50:50,235 --> 00:50:51,360
My god, we're just joking around?

1185
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,517
- [Ray] Just joking around?

1186
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:54,453
I'm tired of this whole job you've got.

1187
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:56,400
- Ruby, maybe you should eat something.

1188
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,808
- Oh, I'm just not very hungry tonight.

1189
00:50:59,808 --> 00:51:02,027
- I can't make this kind of
money doing anything else,

1190
00:51:02,027 --> 00:51:03,271
what do you want me to do?

1191
00:51:03,271 --> 00:51:05,060
- You might as well just be a prostitute.

1192
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,025
I mean what am I supposed to tell people?

1193
00:51:06,025 --> 00:51:07,513
What am I supposed to
tell my friends at school?

1194
00:51:07,513 --> 00:51:09,789
My wife is working as a Playboy bunny?

1195
00:51:09,789 --> 00:51:10,622
Ridiculous!

1196
00:51:10,622 --> 00:51:12,267
- [Evie] Then you go put
yourself through school!

1197
00:51:12,267 --> 00:51:14,226
- [Ray] Fine, maybe I will!

1198
00:51:14,226 --> 00:51:15,059
- Get out!

1199
00:51:24,111 --> 00:51:26,154
I quit college and bust
my butt to pay his tuition

1200
00:51:26,154 --> 00:51:27,987
and he has the nerve to be jealous?

1201
00:51:27,987 --> 00:51:30,884
He thinks that I go to
work to pick up men.

1202
00:51:30,884 --> 00:51:32,817
I mean, it's not like
there's any other job

1203
00:51:32,817 --> 00:51:35,207

gonna pay that well.

1328
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:01,086

- You made this?

1330
00:58:02,436 --> 00:58:04,498
- Yeah, only my sewing
machine broke at the end

1331
00:58:04,498 --> 00:58:07,086

- Try it on, try it on, try it on.

1340
00:58:25,494 --> 00:58:28,827
- No, no, she has another
one to open first, from me.

(upbeat jazz music)

1367
00:59:51,615 --> 00:59:53,604
- There was a smart mob boss

1368
00:59:53,604 --> 00:59:56,875
who decided to hire a deaf
mute as his accountant

1369
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:58,152
'cause he couldn't talk.

1370
00:59:58,152 --> 00:59:59,985
One day he discovers there's
a million dollars missing

1371
00:59:59,985 --> 01:00:01,349
from the bank account.

1372
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:03,964
So he hires an interpreter
and he wants to grill the guy.

1373
01:00:03,964 --> 01:00:06,580
He says "Ask him how much
money's in the bank account."

1374
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:07,786
The interpreter goes "How much money

1375
01:00:07,786 --> 01:00:09,190
is in the bank account?"

1376
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:12,788
The guy goes, "It's all there,
there's two million dollars."

1377
01:00:12,788 --> 01:00:13,994
And so the mob guy goes "Look, tell him

1378
01:00:13,994 --> 01:00:15,292
there's a million dollars missing

1379
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:17,636
and I wanna know where it is."

1380
01:00:17,636 --> 01:00:19,015
He goes, "There's a
million dollars missing.

1381
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:20,756
I wanna know where it is."

1382
01:00:20,756 --> 01:00:22,584
And the mute goes "I don't
know what you're talking about.

1383
01:00:22,584 --> 01:00:24,301
It's all there."

1384
01:00:24,301 --> 01:00:26,950
The mob guy takes out a
gun and says "Listen you,

1385
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,550
I'm gonna blow your head off

1386
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:30,276
if you don't tell me where the money is!"

1387
01:00:30,276 --> 01:00:31,495
(drum hitting)

1388
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:33,090
The interpreter goes, "Listen you."

1389
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:34,559
You know, he had the accent too.

1390
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,848
He goes, "Listen you.

1391
01:00:36,848 --> 01:00:38,405
I'm gonna blow your head off

1392
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:40,151
if you don't tell me where the money is!"

1393
01:00:40,151 --> 01:00:41,248
The mute guy's freaking out,

1394
01:00:41,248 --> 01:00:42,459
his arms are a million a mile minute.

1395
01:00:42,459 --> 01:00:43,736
He goes "It's under my
bed, it's under my bed,

1396
01:00:43,736 --> 01:00:45,159
it's under my bed!"

1397
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:48,250
And the interpreter looks
at the mob guy, he says,

1398
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,933
"He says he thinks you're bluffing."

1399
01:00:49,933 --> 01:00:53,189
(audience laughing)

1400
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:54,832
True story, true story.

1401
01:00:54,832 --> 01:00:56,933
(audience applauding)

1402
01:00:56,933 --> 01:00:58,604
- Gin and tonic.

1403
01:00:58,604 --> 01:00:59,937
Scotch and soda.

1404
01:01:01,253 --> 01:01:03,052
Oh, no, no, no.

1405
01:01:03,052 --> 01:01:04,637
Whiskey Sour.

1406
01:01:04,637 --> 01:01:06,170
Cuba Libre?

1407
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:08,589
Oh, I don't remember
what order they go into.

1408
01:01:08,589 --> 01:01:12,650
- Whiskey Sour, Scotch and
Soda, Gin and Tonic, Cuba Libre.

1409
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:16,914
Just remember, Whales
Swimming Gather No Coral.

1410
01:01:16,914 --> 01:01:17,989
- What?

1411
01:01:17,989 --> 01:01:19,656
- The first letters.

1412
01:01:22,018 --> 01:01:22,935
- Oh, okay.

1413
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:27,007
Gee, thanks Holly, you're the best.

1414
01:01:28,853 --> 01:01:31,738
- Hey look, I got my first $50 tip!

1415
01:01:31,738 --> 01:01:33,821
- Ooh girl, I love those.

1416
01:01:35,307 --> 01:01:40,149
You know what, you have
become one good little bunny.

1417
01:01:40,149 --> 01:01:41,149
- [Holly] Thanks.

1418
01:01:41,149 --> 01:01:42,872
- And I'm really gonna miss you.

1419
01:01:42,872 --> 01:01:44,085
- Miss me?

1420
01:01:44,085 --> 01:01:45,806
Where are you going?

1421
01:01:45,806 --> 01:01:47,139
- Back home to Alabama.

1422
01:01:47,139 --> 01:01:50,043
I wanna see if my family's
okay and everything.

1423
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:51,834
- Wow, I knew you were thinking about it

1424
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,388
but aren't you scared?

1425
01:01:53,388 --> 01:01:54,853
- Scared?

1426
01:01:54,853 --> 01:01:55,936
It's my home.

1427
01:01:57,231 --> 01:01:58,388
- Oh, Georgia.

1428
01:01:58,388 --> 01:01:59,403
- Hey, it's gonna be okay.

1429
01:01:59,403 --> 01:02:01,106
- You're gonna come back though, right?

1430
01:02:01,106 --> 01:02:01,939
- Now, Holly.

1431
01:02:01,939 --> 01:02:05,002
Where's a gal like me
gonna make money this good?

1432
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:07,258
- His wife says "Wow,
can you do that again?"

1433
01:02:07,258 --> 01:02:08,458
He says "I don't think so.

1434
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,786
I don't think I can fit
another roll up my tush!"

1435
01:02:10,786 --> 01:02:11,837
(drum rolling)

1436
01:02:11,837 --> 01:02:13,670
- Get some cigarettes?

1437
01:02:14,576 --> 01:02:16,826
Ma'am, would you like some?

1438
01:02:19,818 --> 01:02:21,842
- Hey, how you doing, Rube?

1439
01:02:21,842 --> 01:02:22,675
- Great.

1440
01:02:22,675 --> 01:02:25,003
- I missed you the last
couple nights after work.

1441
01:02:25,003 --> 01:02:26,754
- Been busy.

1442
01:02:26,754 --> 01:02:28,730
- Well I tried on the dress.

1443
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:30,570
It's incredible.

1444
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:31,850
- That's great.

1445
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:33,684
Look, I've gotta work, so.

1446
01:02:33,684 --> 01:02:37,429
- You know, I'm gonna wear it
to the New Year's Eve party.

1447
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:38,262
- Great.

1448
01:02:39,557 --> 01:02:41,906
- It's good to see you're
doing your fashions again.

1449
01:02:41,906 --> 01:02:44,445
Haven't seen much of that lately.

1450
01:02:44,445 --> 01:02:46,229
Ruby, please.

1451
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:48,162
You're my best friend.

1452
01:02:48,162 --> 01:02:49,325
Please don't be mad at me

1453
01:02:49,325 --> 01:02:52,490
because I got the black
suit and you didn't.

1454
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:56,740
- (chuckling) It's just an outfit.

1455
01:02:58,469 --> 01:03:01,469

♪ Ooh bunny girl ♪

1457
01:03:08,902 --> 01:03:11,248
- Hey Ruby, look at the dress!

1458
01:03:11,248 --> 01:03:12,081
Ruby?

1459
01:03:13,515 --> 01:03:14,682
Ruby, wake up.

1460
01:03:15,642 --> 01:03:18,331
You're missing the New Years Eve Party.

1461

Ruby, wake up.

1462

Ruby?

1463
01:03:24,491 --> 01:03:25,670
Dammit, Ruby.

1464
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:26,854
Ruby, wake up!

1465
01:03:26,854 --> 01:03:28,771

You've been sleeping all day.

1467
01:03:36,326 --> 01:03:38,465
- I was having the most amazing dream.

1468
01:03:38,465 --> 01:03:41,050
- Did it go something like this?

1469
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,606
Dammit Ruby, you've gotta
stop taking those pills!

1470
01:03:43,606 --> 01:03:45,007
They're messing you all up,

1471
01:03:45,007 --> 01:03:46,924
I hardly recognize you!

1472
01:03:48,086 --> 01:03:52,003
- I will be recognizable
in exactly 10 minutes.

1473
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:00,147
Ugh!

1474
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:15,434
Party time.

1475
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:18,767
(energetic dance music)

1476
01:04:43,304 --> 01:04:44,637
- Va-va-va-voom.

1477
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,563
- Stop it, Corky.

1478
01:04:47,563 --> 01:04:50,445
- I am looking at the most
beautiful girl in the room.

1479
01:04:50,445 --> 01:04:52,104
Except for Ruby, of course.

1480
01:04:52,104 --> 01:04:53,932
- And don't you forget it.

1481
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:57,682
I will see you two little
love bunnies later.

1482
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:07,610
- She's a big girl, Holly.

1483
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:08,944
She knows what she's doing.

1484
01:05:08,944 --> 01:05:11,027
- I don't think she does.

1485
01:05:25,823 --> 01:05:27,914
- Happy New Years, gentlemen.

1486
01:05:27,914 --> 01:05:29,247
Hi, James.

1487
01:05:29,247 --> 01:05:30,706
- My god.

1488
01:05:30,706 --> 01:05:32,111
Don't you look delicious.

1489
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:33,448
- Oh, you like it?

1490
01:05:33,448 --> 01:05:35,071
- We should have New Years more often.

1491
01:05:35,071 --> 01:05:35,944
- Excuse us gentlemen,

1492
01:05:35,944 --> 01:05:37,290
there's something I need to discuss

1493
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:39,207
with this handsome man.

1494
01:05:40,526 --> 01:05:43,764
Hope you don't mind me dragging you away.

1495
01:05:43,764 --> 01:05:44,870
- Mind?

1496
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:46,071
I was just biding my time

1497
01:05:46,071 --> 01:05:49,271
waiting for you to come down.

1498
01:05:49,271 --> 01:05:50,405
You hungry?

1499
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:52,422
There's a fabulous buffet
in the dining hall.

1500
01:05:52,422 --> 01:05:54,671
- No, no, no, I'm not eating tonight.

1501
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:55,968
I'm just drinking.

1502
01:05:55,968 --> 01:05:57,911
It's easier for me to watch the figure.

1503
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:01,287
- Well, I trust I'll get to see

1504
01:06:01,287 --> 01:06:03,787
a little bit more of it later.

1505
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:08,903
- Holly.

1506
01:06:08,903 --> 01:06:10,806
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

1507
01:06:10,806 --> 01:06:12,549
This is James, remember?

1508
01:06:12,549 --> 01:06:14,514
- It's nice to meet you, James.

1509
01:06:14,514 --> 01:06:15,424
- Wow.

1510
01:06:15,424 --> 01:06:17,459
It's nice to meet you, Holly.

1511
01:06:17,459 --> 01:06:19,770
That's a fabulous dress, my dear.

1512
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:22,509
- Ruby designed it for me.

1513
01:06:22,509 --> 01:06:24,339
- Hidden talents.

1514
01:06:24,339 --> 01:06:26,509
- She designed her own dress too.

1515
01:06:26,509 --> 01:06:28,346
- My goodness.

1516
01:06:28,346 --> 01:06:31,179
We're in the company of an artist.

1517
01:06:32,448 --> 01:06:34,231
So, Bunny Holly.

1518
01:06:34,231 --> 01:06:38,427
You gonna sing Peggy
Sue for me? (laughing)

1519
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,879
(both laughing)

1520
01:06:41,879 --> 01:06:43,712
- Girl needs a refill.

1521
01:06:44,665 --> 01:06:45,758
Here you go.

1522
01:06:45,758 --> 01:06:47,091
- No, thank you.

1523
01:06:48,841 --> 01:06:49,758
- Oh, wait.

1524
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:56,083
You can go.

1525
01:07:01,071 --> 01:07:05,406
- [Holly] Remember we
have to work tomorrow.

1526
01:07:05,406 --> 01:07:06,323
- Yes, mom.

1528
01:07:16,062 --> 01:07:17,113
- [Corky] Guess who?

1529
01:07:17,113 --> 01:07:18,676
- You're touching a bunny, Corky.

1530
01:07:18,676 --> 01:07:20,702
- How did you get that so fast?

1531
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:21,696
- I'm a bunny genius.

1532
01:07:21,696 --> 01:07:23,081
- Mmm.

1533
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,698
You having a good time?

1534
01:07:24,698 --> 01:07:25,639
- It's okay.

1535
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:26,761
- Good, you hate it.

1536
01:07:26,761 --> 01:07:27,881
I have a birthday surprise for you.

1537
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:29,210
- My birthday was last week

1538
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:31,102
and you sent me flowers.

1539
01:07:31,102 --> 01:07:32,375
- I didn't say birthday present.

1540
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:33,914
I said birthday surprise.

1541
01:07:33,914 --> 01:07:38,300
And traditionally the surprise
comes after the present.

1542
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:39,297
- Okay.

1543
01:07:39,297 --> 01:07:40,985
- Good, you have to come with me upstairs.

1544
01:07:40,985 --> 01:07:42,119
- Right, nice try.

1545
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:43,210
- No, it's nothing like that.

1546
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:44,738
Just come with me.

1547
01:07:44,738 --> 01:07:45,571
Trust me.

1548
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:52,279
Voila, right in here,
let me get the lights.

1549
01:07:52,279 --> 01:07:53,893
Ah.

1550
01:07:53,893 --> 01:07:55,608
Ooh, Hef's private stash.

1551
01:07:55,608 --> 01:07:57,253
- Are we supposed to be in here?

1552
01:07:57,253 --> 01:07:58,793
- Yeah, it's okay, we have permission.

1553
01:07:58,793 --> 01:07:59,699
Sort of. (clears throat)

1554
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:01,452
Yeah, come right his way.

1555
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:03,132
One way right there.

1556
01:08:03,132 --> 01:08:04,708
Don't you love that?

1557
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:06,042
Now, Miss Bunny Holly,

1558
01:08:06,042 --> 01:08:09,509
I'd like to introduce
you to the Chicago Bears.

1559
01:08:09,509 --> 01:08:11,127
- (chuckling) This is my surprise?

1560
01:08:11,127 --> 01:08:12,778
- Yeah, I'm gonna teach
you about football.

1561
01:08:12,778 --> 01:08:15,143
Don't you wanna learn?

1562
01:08:15,143 --> 01:08:16,667
- I believe I do.

1563
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:17,547
- Good.

1564
01:08:17,547 --> 01:08:19,143
My Bears are playing the Vikings.

1565
01:08:19,143 --> 01:08:20,718
They're from Minnesota.

1566
01:08:20,718 --> 01:08:22,153
You know where that is, right?

1567
01:08:22,153 --> 01:08:23,665
- Yes I know where Minnesota is.

1568
01:08:23,665 --> 01:08:24,631
- See, I love this.

1569
01:08:24,631 --> 01:08:25,464
It's gonna be very easy.

1570
01:08:25,464 --> 01:08:27,844
Now, the Vikings have
this new quarterback,

1571
01:08:27,844 --> 01:08:30,460
Fran Tarkington, who we, me and you, hate.

1572
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:33,044
He made four touchdown passes
in his very first game.

1573
01:08:33,044 --> 01:08:34,929
But the Bears have some new guys too.

1574
01:08:34,929 --> 01:08:36,892
They have this tight end Mike Ditka.

1575
01:08:36,892 --> 01:08:38,570
He's becoming an instant star,

1576
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:40,448
he's got a very good sense of strategy.

1577
01:08:40,448 --> 01:08:42,781
I think one day he'll coach.

1578
01:08:44,428 --> 01:08:46,547
Don't worry, this is
just the background info.

1579
01:08:46,547 --> 01:08:48,032
You ready?

1580
01:08:48,032 --> 01:08:49,064
- Yeah.

1581
01:08:49,064 --> 01:08:49,897
- All right.

1582
01:08:49,897 --> 01:08:50,730
(parade music)

1583
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:51,639
Ditka on the cross.

1584
01:08:51,639 --> 01:08:52,889
He's got it!

1585
01:08:52,889 --> 01:08:54,198
No, Ditka's that guy.

1586
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:55,197
No, he's that guy!

1587
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,203
He's completely confusing the opposition!

1588
01:08:57,203 --> 01:08:58,682
HE's completely confusing me.

1589
01:08:58,682 --> 01:08:59,848
But whatever it is, it's working

1590
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:01,635
because he's on the 10, he's on the five.

1591
01:09:01,635 --> 01:09:03,382
He's back on the 20, that's okay.

1592
01:09:03,382 --> 01:09:04,215
He's moving forward.

1593
01:09:04,215 --> 01:09:06,015
He's one on one, one man to beat.

1594
01:09:06,015 --> 01:09:08,182
10, five, touchdown Ditka!

1595
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:11,029
The man cannot be stopped.

1596
01:09:11,029 --> 01:09:12,399
The audience is going crazy,

1597
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:16,120
all 82,342 on their feet screaming!

1598
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:19,491

01:09:34,654 --> 01:09:36,071
You should do it.

1603
01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:42,215
- Here's the pitch.

1604
01:09:42,215 --> 01:09:44,036

yourself at some rich guy

I'm certainly better than you.

01:18:11,774 --> 01:18:12,703
You're jealous.

1795
01:18:12,703 --> 01:18:14,665
- Right, that's a good one.

1796
01:18:14,665 --> 01:18:16,353
- You can't stand the fact that you're not

1797
01:18:16,353 --> 01:18:18,625
in control of my life anymore, can you?

1798
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:21,042
- Your life is tiny and safe.

1799
01:18:23,893 --> 01:18:26,226
Your life is beige corduroy.

1800
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:31,513

1801
01:18:32,755 --> 01:18:33,922
- You do that.

1802
01:18:35,739 --> 01:18:37,553
You know, you wouldn't even have that job

1803
01:18:37,553 --> 01:18:39,303
if it weren't for me.

1804
01:18:42,447 --> 01:18:45,465
- You think whatever you need to.

1805
01:18:45,465 --> 01:18:47,882
(soft music)

1806
01:18:55,545 --> 01:18:59,649
- Attention, attention
girlies, gather round.

1807
01:18:59,649 --> 01:19:01,830
The holidays are long gone.

1808
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:03,900
Eggnog, stuffing, gingerbread,

1809
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,770
these are just some of the treats

1810
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:08,979
that turn cute little
bunnies into big fat hippos.

1811
01:19:08,979 --> 01:19:10,484
So waddle on up to the scale

1812
01:19:10,484 --> 01:19:13,651
and let's get this disaster over with.

1813
01:19:14,908 --> 01:19:17,881
- Holly, take Ruby's
assignment in the showroom.

1814
01:19:17,881 --> 01:19:20,172
- But Miranda, I'm sure she
has a really good excuse.

1815
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,708
- She probably just
missed her bus and just-

1816
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:25,458
- Actually, I just saw her and...

1817
01:19:32,549 --> 01:19:33,382
- What?

1818
01:19:47,977 --> 01:19:49,651

like to move your fanny

01:21:46,999 --> 01:21:48,290
to New York?

1851

- New York?

1852
01:21:49,162 --> 01:21:50,530

1853
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:51,821

1854
01:21:51,821 --> 01:21:53,878

I don't know, I think you
fall into that classification.

1856

- New York, wow.

1857
01:21:59,866 --> 01:22:01,591

He'd follow you to the ends of the earth.

1861
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:19,007
