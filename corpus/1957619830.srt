00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:07,540
(dramatic, ominous
  electronic music)

2
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,865
- [Narrator] After
 the final nuclear war,

3
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,268
radiation devastated the land.

4
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,102
Few survived.

5
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,339
Those who did survive, desperate
for food and protection

6
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:17,077
formed gangs to scavenge
and fend for themselves.

7
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,347
One group, craving a
return to law and order

8
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:24,551
created the Alpha League,
  a democratic society.

9
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,154
It wasn't long before
the League was attacked

10
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,255
by outsiders.

11
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,493
But the most devastating
  assault came from traitors

12
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,962
within the League's own ranks.

13
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,637
(ominous music)

14
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,016
- Fire.

15
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,321
- Come on! Come on!

16
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,413
- Fire!

17
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,653
(explosions banging)

18
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:36,155
- Pull back.

19
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,402
- Major, over there, we have
 to capture that arsenal.

20
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,607
- Baker 12, unit
  Baker 12 come in.

21
00:02:59,045 --> 00:02:59,879
- Talbot here.

22
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,747
- Arsenal at 10 o'clock.

23
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,015
Secure at all costs.

24
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,483
- Yes sir.

25
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,317
Let's go!

26
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,173
(machine guns cracking)

27
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,675
- Harry, blow the arsenal!

28
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,143
- But we need the gunpowder.

29
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,778
- If I can't have it,
 Shelton can't have it.

30
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,146
I said, blow it now.

31
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,448
- But it's our own
  men guarding it.

32
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,416
Ackerman.

33
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,250
- Yo.

34
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,084
- Blow the arsenal.

35
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,692
- Blow the arsenal.

36
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,932
- Hey!

37
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:53,967
- Get the bazooka.

38
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,938
Blow the fuckin' arsenal.

39
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,949
- We're running
  out of ammunition.

40
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,884
- Pull back! Pull back!

41
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,399
(soldiers yelling)

42
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,709
- Deserters are in
full retreat Commander.

43
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,777
- Anything on Clay?

44
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,279
- We didn't have a fix on him.

45
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,314
- Get me Brodie.

46
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,626
- Captain Brodie, it's
 Commander Shelton.

47
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,560
- Sir.

48
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,329
- Listen Brodie, find Clay.

49
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,299
I want to make an example out
 of that traitorous bastard.

50
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,600
I must have him alive.

51
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,979
- To the ruins.

52
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,506
- Come on.

53
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:42,608
Move out.

54
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,187
- Guns down!

55
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,526
You shouldn't have
  turned on us Clay.

56
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,262
- Get him! Get him!

57
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,816
- Hold it!

58
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:30,917
Come on guys.

59
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,193
Come on.

60
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,027
Let's go.

61
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,274
(trumpet blaring)

62
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,479
(cheering)

63
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,581
- We did it, we did it!

64
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,119
- Colonel Clay's
  escaped Commander.

65
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,022
We don't know where he is.

66
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,260
- Captain.

67
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,728
- Yes, Talbot.

68
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,197
- My hitch was up
 about six months ago

69
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,433
and since the League has
come out of this on top,

70
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,368
I'd like your
permission to head home.

71
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,104
- Where you from Sergeant?

72
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,205
- Pagosa Valley.

73
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,209
- Tell you the truth,
 I wish you'd stay.

74
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,613
You're the best I've got
  and I need guys like you.

75
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,214
- I've got a wife back home sir.

76
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,751
- Well, I guess I can't
compete with that can I?

77
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,353
- No sir!

78
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,354
- Good luck Talbot.

79
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,688
- Thank you sir, thank you.

80
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,428
(men yelling)

81
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,168
- What are the damages?

82
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,872
- Oh around 300 casualties,
 another 250 injured.

83
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,540
- Terminate the serious ones.

84
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,243
We can't afford to
  drag them along.

85
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,511
What about materials?

86
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,747
- Now way getting around
it, we're in bad shape.

87
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,881
See for yourself.

88
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,785
- How long before
 we're up and running?

89
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,886
- Not that long.

90
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,389
Gunpowder's our biggest problem.

91
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,790
- Then we'll find some more.

92
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,725
It's the difference
 between winning and losing.

93
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,294
If we hadn't been
  running low on ammunition

94
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,696
we would have
 broken their asses.

95
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,998
I won't accept this defeat.

96
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,035
I don't accept it.

97
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,841
- Good stuff,
 where'd you find it?

98
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:36,676
- Been saving it.

99
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:39,812
What are the goats for?

100
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,548
There's some nice girls
around here Talbot,

101
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,384
all you got to do is ask.

102
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,086
- I'm taking them
  home to my wife.

103
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,222
- Didn't know you were married.

104
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,057
- Yeah.

105
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,093
- Does this mean you're
out of the military?

106
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,429
- First thing in the morning,
 I'm finished with it.

107
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,633
- Yeah, but is it
  finished with you?

108
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,507
- Brodie, there's
 something I want you to do.

109
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,577
It's urgent and it
  requires secrecy.

110
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,411
- Gunpowder!

111
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,081
- We've got to
 replenish our supply.

112
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,452
- Won't be easy, I
 mean stuff is scarce.

113
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,255
- I've just received a field
 report from Ballentine.

114
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,890
You know the place?

115
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,762
- Know the place, it's a fuckin'
hellhole, I've been there.

116
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,431
- A couple of our
  recruiters just got back,

117
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,867
said they heard word
 about a lost mine.

118
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,502
Some kind of black powder.

119
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,739
If this is true, we
 have to get our hands

120
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,040
on it before Clay does.

121
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:43,743
- On my way.

122
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,060
- Rider!

123
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,161
Rider coming!

124
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,139
- Who's in charge here?

125
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,241
- Vera!

126
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,311
- That's me, I'm head
of the village council.

127
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,913
- Thought maybe you had
some trouble out here.

128
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,948
We've been trying to raise
 you for the last three days.

129
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,950
- Yeah, our radio's out.

130
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,585
Thanks for checking on us.

131
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,221
- I guess that means
you folks haven't heard.

132
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,258
There was a big face-off
at Breakdown Canyon.

133
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,860
The insurrection is busted.

134
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,096
(cheering)

135
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,132
- Are you saying it's over?

136
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,901
- Just got some
  mopping up to do.

137
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,269
- Did you hear that Pops?

138
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,572
- I heard and I'll
  believe it when I see it.

139
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,673
- Aah Pops!

140
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,275
- I know you want to see Talbot,

141
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,976
just don't want you
 to get your hopes up.

142
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,778
I've been through
 this too many times.

143
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,014
- How come you're
 always a skeptic huh?

144
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,782
- Cause I love you,
 that's how come.

145
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,318
- Maybe he'll be
  coming home soon.

146
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,153
- Maybe he will.

147
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,292
- How about some breakfast?

148
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,760
- Thought you'd never ask.

149
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:20,973
- It's a raid!

150
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,346
- Fire!

151
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,188
Fire!

152
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,694
- Yeah ha!

153
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,362
- Let's go! Let's go!

154
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,131
- Attack!

155
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,734
(yelling)

156
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,882
(people screaming)

157
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:57,836
- Vera!

158
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,373
Go, go, get out of here!

159
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,413
- Hold on Pops!

160
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,247
- Go!

161
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,119
Aaargh!

162
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,924
(laughing)

163
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,136
- What the fuck
  is this a picnic?

164
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,706
Go after them, go! Go! Go!

165
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,540
I want her!

166
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,808
Go get her now!

167
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,317
(men groaning)

168
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,354
Ha! Ha!

169
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,464
(man screaming)

170
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,904
(tense music)

171
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,314
(guns banging)

172
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,227
(men screaming)

173
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,416
(laughing)

174
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,295
Yeah!

175
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,115
(Pops groaning)

176
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,058
- Help me!

177
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,660
Can't you see he's hurt.

178
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,737
Help me!

179
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,773
- Sure, we'll help you!

180
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:25,677
- No!
 (gun banging)

181
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,913
(laughing)

182
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,053
- Hold it bitch.

183
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,790
- Get her up here, come on.

184
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:49,334
(laughing)

185
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,513
Get her in the car!

186
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,306
(dark, depressing music)

187
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,192
- Who was it?

188
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,061
- Hog, Hoghead.

189
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,329
- Where's Vera?

190
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,185
- Stash the powder
  in the armory.

191
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,152
- Come on, move it!

192
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,389
- Bring her to my room.

193
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,190
- Ow!

194
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,401
- Not bad.

195
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,505
Not a bad score, gents.

196
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,740
You got a name?

197
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,110
- Fuck you.

198
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,178
- Good name, Fuck you.

199
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,080
I like it, has a
nice ring to it.

200
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:47,753
Fuck you, Kingsley,
 Gonzales, Fuck you!

201
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,988
(laughing)

202
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:57,062
You know any good
  jokes Fuck you?

203
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:57,896
Oh.

204
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,967
I never get to hear any
more jokes you know.

205
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,101
Nobody's got it.

206
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,177
She's a fighter, I
like that, that I like.

207
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,912
You think she's a screamer too?

208
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,181
God I hope so.

209
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,120
Fuck you, I got a joke for you.

210
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,823
You want to hear it, you
want to hear my joke?

211
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,425
It's a good one.

212
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,360
- Here's the joke.
  (heads banging)

213
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,194
- Oh!

214
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,464
- Where you going bitch?

215
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,268
- I'm gonna clock your ass.

216
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,944
Fuck me, Fuck you.

217
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,546
Nobody's done that in a while.

218
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,953
I'm gonna take my time with you.

219
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,290
Get her out of here.

220
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,262
Jesus Christ.

221
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,231
- The fuck do we have here?

222
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,035
- Bosses special goods.

223
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,436
Put her in the bridal suite.

224
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,011
Sleep tight babe.

225
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:22,447
Nobody touches her but the boss.

226
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,149
- Right, nobody
  but the boss okay.

227
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,919
- For now, my turn
  will come later.

228
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:55,781
- Talbot!

229
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:56,581
- Yeah!

230
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,624
Oh my God, Vera!

231
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,426
- This was an old
  man I buried here.

232
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,796
There was a woman.

233
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,030
But they took her.

234
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,298
- Hoghead?

235
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,434
- Bunch of his scumbags.

236
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,802
- You know where they went?

237
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,572
- These tracks won't last
 long if this wind picks up.

238
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:21,773
- Which way are you headed?

239
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:22,874
- Ballentine.

240
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:23,709
- Let's go.

241
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,718
- Fire! Fire!

242
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,740
(yelling)

243
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:00,912
- Ha! Ha!

244
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:03,882
Let's go!

245
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,821
(machine gunfire clattering)

246
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,755
- Where's the gunpowder?

247
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,056
- Gunpowder?

248
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,792
We haven't got any gunpowder.

249
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,461
- This is a potassium
 mine isn't it?

250
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,596
- Sure, but it's all played out.

251
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,365
Ain't no powder here mister.

252
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,100
- Search every
  inch of the place.

253
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,768
- Search this place
 from top to bottom.

254
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,403
Go on, move out.

255
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,204
- Let's go.

256
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,240
- This is a waste of ammunition.

257
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,476
Can't afford to use
 it up on nothing.

258
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,978
- We've got to
 beef up our forces.

259
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,713
- And I think I know just how.

260
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,682
- Hey bro, how'd you find me?

261
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,350
- Just followed the smell.

262
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,153
- (laughs) Get your ass in here.

263
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,324
- Okay.

264
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:02,801
- Get a move on sugar pie, got
 a whole army waiting on you.

265
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,608
You're off tonight babe.

266
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:13,445
Got some high-level talks in
 progress and I do mean high.

267
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:17,716
- Fine, I'd rather spend
the night with Meatball.

268
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,754
- How you fixed for gunpowder?

269
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,390
- I'm doing fine.

270
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,224
- Yeah?

271
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,058
- Yeah.

272
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,462
- How about staking me
  with some of your surplus.

273
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:36,234
(laughing) Momma never
  did teach you how to lie.

274
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,035
- Fuck off.

275
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,271
- If you're running short.

276
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,273
Powder, me too.

277
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,177
Sort of puts a cramp on
  your lifestyle doesn't it.

278
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:49,080
(laughs) The man with
 the powder rules.

279
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,883
You know who that is?

280
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:52,918
The Alpha League.

281
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,987
You think they just
 gonna sit there.

282
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,658
You weren't made to
 take shit off nobody.

283
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,060
I wasn't made to
 take shit off nobody.

284
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,064
Turn your back on me bro,

285
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,600
you're gonna lose
 everything you love.

286
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:18,843
- What say we go in,
blow this old man away.

287
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,247
(both laughing)

288
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,350
- Yeah, you got a million
  years of terror stored up

289
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,653
in there just
 waiting to get out.

290
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,922
(laughing)

291
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,162
(suspenseful music)

292
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,401
(yelling)

293
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:38,957
- How you feeling?

294
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,595
What's your name?

295
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,030
- Sierra.

296
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,464
- I'm Brodie, that's Talbot.

297
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,268
- Where'd you come from?

298
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,102
- Far away.

299
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,773
- What am I supposed
 to do with you?

300
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,441
- I can take care of myself.

301
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,710
- Yeah, sure.

302
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,978
Here, have some water.

303
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,703
Hey, where are you going?

304
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,241
- Nice looking girl.

305
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,383
What is it?

306
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,422
You came here because of
  this, because of a reward?

307
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,325
- Worry about your wife Talbot.

308
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:50,728
Over there.

309
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,231
- Those two.

310
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,234
- Easy.

311
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,738
Maybe they can lead you to Vera.

312
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,507
Follow them, I'll catch up.

313
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,312
(shouting excitedly)

314
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,282
Hey, what's going on?

315
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,217
- They don't want them here.

316
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,485
They say bad for business.

317
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,320
- What's the matter?

318
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,488
Can't stand the competition?

319
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,793
What are you looking at?

320
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,578
- What do you want?

321
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:44,182
- Whatever you got with
the strongest kick.

322
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,120
- 100 bucks a shot.

323
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,688
What are you paying with?

324
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:51,523
- Nothing.

325
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,326
- Hey, what are you doing?

326
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:58,096
I said I want
 something to drink.

327
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,569
All I want is a couple of shots.

328
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:18,650
- There's a hundred bucks in
 there, grab it, it's yours.

329
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,052
- He's poisonous.

330
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,391
- No gloves.

331
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,128
- Last guy who tried that,

332
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,697
why he's got himself a
 little grave up on the hill.

333
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,237
- Takes about 30 seconds
for the juice to set in

334
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,638
once he bites.

335
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,373
Don't it Kingsley?

336
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,542
- I've seen it
 before, it's gruesome.

337
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:56,554
- Nice move.

338
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,534
- Nice throw.

339
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,638
- You rat bastard,
  it almost bit me.

340
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,340
- Hey relax, relax.

341
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,774
Get the man a drink.

342
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:20,144
Hell he earned it. (laughs)

343
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,647
(speaking in a foreign language)

344
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,015
- You speak their language.

345
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,953
Ask him something for me.

346
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,123
Ask him if they've
  heard any talk.

347
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,725
- About what?

348
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,060
- Black powder that flashes,

349
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,929
hidden in the
 mountains someplace.

350
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,130
- You've heard this?

351
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,698
- Ask him.

352
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,734
(speaking foreign language)

353
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,802
(laughs)

354
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,338
- Why's he laughing?

355
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:48,473
- He's heard the stories.

356
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,774
Everybody's heard them.

357
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:50,575
- Tell me.

358
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:55,413
(speaking foreign language)

359
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,883
- A lost tribe in the
  mountains, sun worshipers,

360
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,486
magic dust, they
 call it Black Quinn,

361
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,354
they use it in their ceremonies.

362
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,622
- Where in the mountains?

363
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,359
(speaking foreign language)

364
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,194
- He says Agila Point.

365
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,462
- Agila Point?

366
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:15,099
To the east, that's
 a helluva long way.

367
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,906
- So what brings
  you to Ballantine?

368
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,676
- Passing through,
nothing left in the car.

369
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,477
- Well hell son, why don't
  you throw in with us.

370
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:29,514
I just might have
  something for ya.

371
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,616
This might be your lucky day.

372
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,697
- You don't belong
 in the desert do you?

373
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,198
Where do you belong?

374
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,734
How'd those hunters
 get hold of you?

375
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:50,535
- I was alone.

376
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,306
- You think I ask a lot
of questions don't you?

377
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,475
- What you got here girl.

378
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,111
Looks like gunpowder to me?

379
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,015
- Watch it.

380
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,621
(grunting)

381
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,830
- What's going on out there?

382
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,664
- Come on!

383
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,267
(yelling)

384
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,776
- Well we're going back to camp.

385
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,044
Coming with us or not?

386
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:33,978
- Yeah I'm coming.

387
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,113
- Best move you ever made.

388
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:42,019
(suspenseful music)

389
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,736
- Look soldiers!

390
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,612
- I'm looking for recruits.

391
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,113
I got food.

392
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:12,049
You can join me or you can
  stay, which will it be?

393
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:14,385
- I'm not going anywhere,
  I'm staying here.

394
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,219
Oooh!

395
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,121
(laughing)

396
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,523
- Anybody else want to stay?

397
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,364
(slow, gentle music)

398
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:41,879
- What's wrong?

399
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,150
- Where'd you get this?

400
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,723
You come from Agila
 Point don't you?

401
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:58,329
Is that why he was laughing,
 your little friend?

402
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,565
You're from the mountains.

403
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,972
So why were you
 alone in the desert?

404
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,275
- I was on a spirit quest.

405
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,980
All my people do it when
  they reach a certain age.

406
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,985
My father was once
 a warrior like you.

407
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:21,919
Not any more.

408
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:27,058
He led my people into the
 mountains when I was a baby,

409
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,493
no more fighting.

410
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,498
(gun firing)

411
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:39,704
(men laughing and yelling)

412
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,220
- You guys won't learn will you?

413
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,564
- Aaargh! Aaargh!

414
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,999
Oh my eyes, aaargh!

415
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,900
Oh my eyes!

416
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,490
(speaking foreign language)

417
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,494
- To close the wound,
  otherwise he lose his arm.

418
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,142
(groaning)

419
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,716
- Yeah, you see with you
and your reinforcements,

420
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,284
we can level those motherfuckers

421
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,886
and kick the shit out of them.

422
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,136
- New man here,
  his name's Talbot.

423
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,605
What's up?

424
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,073
- Clay's asking for help.

425
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,609
They spotted a yellow-vested
convoy en route to Window Rock.

426
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:25,876
- Yeah, they're
 going for a reason.

427
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:27,745
Clay figures it must
 be black powder.

428
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,147
(yelling)

429
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:30,982
Yeah.

430
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:32,950
- Come on.

431
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,793
(groaning)

432
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:50,868
- What's wrong?

433
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,038
- I don't feel so hot.

434
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,674
I think it's that schlop
you've been feeding us.

435
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,917
- Maybe I can make you
  feel a little better huh.

436
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,856
Hey baby, how's that huh?

437
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,469
(prisoner's yelling)

438
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,901
(suspenseful music)

439
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,310
(gunfire)

440
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,889
- Don't move lady.

441
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,094
- Wait, don't hurt her.

442
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,496
She's the boss's girl.

443
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,601
Alright, take her
  back to her cell.

444
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,789
- Where are we going?

445
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,357
- I'm taking you home.

446
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,792
I'll take care of you.

447
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,741
(shouting in foreign language)

448
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,801
- Sierra, I thought I'd
never see you again.

449
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,335
Who's he?

450
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:42,773
- He saved my life, please
 let him stay till he's well.

451
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,148
- I have a feeling, the
sooner we get this stuff

452
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,250
back to the fort the better sir.

453
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,920
- Right, our reserves
are low enough as it is.

454
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,590
The last thing we want is for
 Clay to get his hands on it.

455
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,225
Incoming, take cover!

456
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:19,810
(machine guns rattling)

457
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,835
Fall back! Get back!

458
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:21,672
- Let's go.

459
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:24,441
- Get back!

460
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,748
(laughing)

461
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:44,828
Fall back!

462
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,333
(ominous music)

463
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,473
- Thanks for the
  gunpowder captain.

464
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,709
- Go to hell Clay.

465
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:03,314
- I'll return the favor by
 saving you the embarrassment

466
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,215
of making you report to Shelton.

467
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,700
- Not a bad haul, huh bro?

468
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,170
- Not bad, but not nearly
 enough to get the job done.

469
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,905
Take this back to your camp.

470
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,139
I'll keep looking.

471
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:35,846
Ackerman, let's go.

472
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,481
- Okay, keep going.

473
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:42,086
(slow, gentle music)

474
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:55,432
- He's a strong man, in the
 morning he'll be better.

475
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,568
- His strength comes
 from his heart.

476
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:58,736
He's a good man.

477
00:43:58,736 --> 00:43:59,870
- He's a soldier.

478
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,374
We don't need his
 world coming in here.

479
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:04,475
We just don't need it.

480
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,540
- Powder burns!

481
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,808
- The mountain girl.

482
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:40,678
Gunpowder, she's got it.

483
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,279
- Where is this girl?

484
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:45,916
- Gone, gone!

485
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:46,917
Can you help me.

486
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,256
(screaming)

487
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,316
- What do you call your village?

488
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:53,150
- Puerto del Sol.

489
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,587
- Gate to the sun.

490
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,692
I can see why your father
doesn't want people coming here.

491
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:05,229
All my life I've been fighting.

492
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:08,098
Right now, for the first time,

493
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,701
I feel I know what it
means to live in peace.

494
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,390
Must be a couple
of tons of this.

495
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,825
Have you been working this mine?

496
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,528
- This is the way we
 found it 20 years ago.

497
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:38,796
The miners abandoned it.

498
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,235
- Stuff is still volatile.

499
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,004
- We only use it
  in our ceremonies.

500
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,874
You should never have
brought him here Sierra.

501
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:54,711
You've been teaching our
young men how to fight.

502
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:55,879
- They know already.

503
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,381
I'm only giving them pointers.

504
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,317
There's a war on you know.

505
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,986
- It would be better if
we don't get involved.

506
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,622
- You know this
 makes you vulnerable.

507
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:09,560
- But if no one knows then
  nothing can happen to us.

508
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,794
Will you tell them?

509
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:11,628
- I have to.

510
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,998
You have a potassium mine.

511
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,900
- If you do, they'll destroy us.

512
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,141
- Yeah what is it?

513
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,543
- Couple of the boys just
 brought in this desert hunter.

514
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,080
- We were up on the
 hill hunting boar.

515
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,582
We caught a girl.

516
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,617
- The one with the powder.

517
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:34,918
- Where'd you find her?

518
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:35,719
- Up there.

519
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:36,653
- How far.

520
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,021
- A few miles.

521
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,756
- You show us.

522
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,225
- What about the reward?

523
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,594
- You'll get the reward
when we get the powder.

524
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,936
(ominous music)

525
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,016
- It's Utopia Talbot,
 is this everything

526
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,484
you ever wanted or what?

527
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:10,287
- Where are all those women
 you keep bragging about.

528
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,789
- We keep 'em under lock
  and key where they belong.

529
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,392
What's the matter son, you got
 an itch in your jock strap?

530
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,394
- Yeah, just like
 everybody else around here.

531
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,629
- Well you hang on to it.

532
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:21,365
We got a way of doing
 things around here.

533
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:22,199
Wait here.

534
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,436
- So where'd you pick
up this new guy Talbot.

535
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:27,704
- Ballantine.

536
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,106
I wouldn't trust him?

537
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:30,340
- Why not?

538
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,209
- Cause I think
 he's a yellow vest.

539
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,577
- So what?

540
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,312
So what if he is a yellow vest.

541
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:43,520
So maybe he won't tell
 Shelton where we are.

542
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,024
You're starting to
  get it Gonzales.

543
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,626
You know, it ain't
 easy being the boss,

544
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,395
cause I got to
 think of everything.

545
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:54,364
Where's Talbot?

546
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,066
- He's outside.

547
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,135
- Think I'll have a
 little chat with him.

548
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:03,707
- Man, that asshole
just gave me another one

549
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,242
of his fuckin' lectures.

550
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:06,610
I'm sick of it.

551
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,679
- Hey relax man,
take a laxative.

552
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:26,396
- Look at this guy sneaking
 around the stockade.

553
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:28,031
Hey asshole!

554
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,067
You're Talbot right,
 come over here.

555
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,809
Kingsley tells me you
 want in the game, why?

556
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,545
- Why not?

557
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,813
- What else is there to say.

558
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,981
You're in Talbot.

559
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,852
Go ahead, relax, settle in.

560
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,321
Grab a broad, have some
  booze, have fun, go ahead.

561
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,090
Oh one thing.

562
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,159
I forgot, I'm getting old.

563
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,862
- What?

564
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:00,230
- Your initiation.

565
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,534
(laughing)

566
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,942
- By order of the
 great dude Hoghead.

567
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,946
Initiation time.

568
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,215
(cheering)

569
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,652
Tonight, a face
  off to the death.

570
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,856
New guy Talbot

571
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,531
versus Gonzo Gonzales.

572
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,970
(crowd cheering)

573
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,732
- Fuck you!

574
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,334
Come here.

575
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:18,241
- Don't snap your fingers
  at me, I'll bite them off.

576
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:28,819
- To the death.

577
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,261
- Yeah!

578
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:11,828
- Kingsley.

579
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:19,536
- Gonzo.

580
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,484
(cheering)

581
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:00,370
(tense music)

582
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,360
- Do you know any jokes?

583
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,794
- What?

584
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,763
- Everybody enjoys a
  game, got to have a joke.

585
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,133
What's the matter, you
 can't think of one?

586
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:32,202
(laughs)

587
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:35,171
Get him out of here.

588
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:49,185
(slow, gentle music)

589
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,509
- What is it?

590
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:13,410
You're going back.

591
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,446
- I have to report
  to my commander.

592
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:17,814
- You don't have to.

593
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,516
As far as they know you're dead.

594
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,651
- Look, sooner or later
 people are going to find out

595
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,086
about the mine.

596
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:25,321
Now maybe the wrong people.

597
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,325
If you turn it over
 to the League now,
 they can protect you.

598
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,561
Porta del Sol will
  be safer that way.

599
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:32,495
- No!

600
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,864
You can't tell them about us!

601
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:36,533
- I'll talk to Joaquin tomorrow.

602
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,801
I'll convince him.

603
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:40,470
- Please don't go,
  don't leave me.

604
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:09,159
(gong ringing)

605
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,213
- What do you want?

606
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:31,981
- Gunpowder.

607
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,483
- We don't have any.

608
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:36,186
- Then you won't object
  if we have a look around.

609
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:41,324
- Nobody enters the village,
 we don't want trouble.

610
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:42,158
- Fire!

611
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,363
(laughing)

612
00:57:56,573 --> 00:58:00,043
(machine guns clattering)

613
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:11,481
- Sierra!

614
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,052
- Brodie!

615
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:25,495
Rocket!

616
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:34,237
(shouting in foreign language)

617
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:42,412
(man groaning)

618
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:50,987
Rockets!

619
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:03,566
(Ackerman laughing)

620
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:07,070
Ackerman, what do you see?

621
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,639
We just struck gold.

622
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,775
- Get some pails,
  kegs, pack it up.

623
01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:16,112
(shouting)

624
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,380
- Payback time.

625
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,790
- Wake up Meatloaf!

626
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:31,160
Time to get this man laid.

627
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,036
- Got a whole bag full
 of goodies over here.

628
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:42,805
You can have any one you want.

629
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,076
Except for her.

630
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,214
Come on up and at 'em girls.

631
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:52,682
Service with a smile.

632
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:55,018
Open it up.

633
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:06,362
(gun bangs)

634
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:10,400
- Meatloaf let him go!

635
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,467
He's my husband.

636
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,011
- Wait.

637
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,046
I'll get it open.

638
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,055
- Here take this.

639
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,694
(tense music)

640
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:45,068
(machine gun clatters)

641
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:53,309
- Urgh, fuck.

642
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:43,126
- Meatloaf!

643
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,834
- Go and find out what the
 hell's going on around here.

644
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:54,937
Hey don't you be
 putting on my hoghead.

645
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,873
If you do I'll know,
 I'll fucking know.

646
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:02,145
Shit!

647
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,849
Get the fuck out
 of my car, get out!

648
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:11,754
It's my car!

649
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,890
(shouting)

650
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:14,724
Come on.

651
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:18,594
(yelling)

652
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,893
(machine gun clattering)

653
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:11,781
- Hold on!

654
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,170
We better go.

655
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,210
(speaking foreign language)

656
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:45,681
- Come on Joaquin don't give
 up, we've got to get out.

657
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,751
Got to get that
  powder to Shelton.

658
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,286
I've got to stop Clay.

659
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:52,021
- But how are you
  gonna stop him.

660
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:55,558
- Listen.

661
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:02,965
(tapping)

662
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:05,301
(muttering)

663
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,394
- Why don't you come with us?

664
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,896
- Too many of my people
have paid the price.

665
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:36,098
For us, it stops right here.

666
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,533
- For me, it can't.

667
01:05:39,935 --> 01:05:41,103
- She loved you Brodie.

668
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:01,824
- He may have the
  troop strength,

669
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,493
but does he have sufficient
gunpowder to launch an assault.

670
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:05,895
- He took the
 Window Rocks blind.

671
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:07,496
He didn't intend
  on stopping there.

672
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:12,268
- Hmmm, well if he attacks,
 we can't hold out for long.

673
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:16,105
Our own supply is badly
  in need of replenishment.

674
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:17,440
- Any word on Brodie.

675
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,274
- Nothing.

676
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:21,977
You better get some rest.

677
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:23,679
Oh and Talbot.

678
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:24,780
- Sir?

679
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,182
- It's good to have you back.

680
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,016
- Thank you sir.

681
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:33,222
(yelling)

682
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:36,792
- My brother's dead!

683
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:46,802
I know what it takes bro,

684
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:49,271
I've been dreaming
about this all my life.

685
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,859
My brother and I, beating
  the shit out of anybody

686
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:13,195
who got in the way
  of what we wanted.

687
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,196
I go to war.

688
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:18,000
I have all the
  gunpowder we need.

689
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:20,936
Do it for him!

690
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:22,171
Do it for him.

691
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:25,241
Show them no fucking mercy.

692
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:26,509
Who's with me!

693
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:29,011
(men yelling)

694
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:45,828
(dramatic, ominous music)

695
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,195
- When the fighting starts.

696
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,263
Tell the men to aim carefully.

697
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,232
We can't afford to
  waste ammunition.

698
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:25,067
We've got to make
 every bullet count.

699
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,779
- What the fuck!

700
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:39,982
It's Brodie.

701
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:40,850
Stop him!

702
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:33,169
- Gunpowder!

703
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,603
- Man I thought we'd lost you.

704
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:36,639
Talbot start packing rounds,
 put as many men on it

705
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,907
as we can spare.

706
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:38,874
- I hope it lasts.

707
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:44,146
- Launch the attack.

708
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,215
- Alright move it, let's go!

709
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:48,717
(men yelling)

710
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,893
- Let's go guys.

711
01:09:57,893 --> 01:09:58,794
- Let's go!

712
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:05,634
- Let's go!

713
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:29,825
Fall back!

714
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:34,430
- Go!

715
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,932
(men yelling)

716
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:57,786
- What's going on?

717
01:10:57,786 --> 01:10:58,621
- They broke in
through on both flanks.

718
01:10:58,621 --> 01:10:59,455
The ammunition's gone.

719
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:00,623
We can't hold them.

720
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:34,757
- Fall back.

721
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:00,149
(yelling)

722
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:57,172
(whooping and howling)

723
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:02,244
- Mountain people!

724
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:10,886
- Aaah!

725
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,521
- Oooh!

726
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:13,355
- Urgh!

727
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:18,587
(whooping)

728
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:53,655
- Cover the stairs.

729
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:37,232
Kill him!

730
