2
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:30,333
What's taking you so long?

3
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:32,251
I just wanted you to fix the leak.

4
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,249
Look, lady, to fix the leak

5
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:37,486
I need to find the leak.

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,918
(material ripping)

7
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,117
Hold on.

8
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:47,715
You find the leak?

9
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:50,033
(grunts)

10
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,149
I found something.

11
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:07,896
Okay, I'm ready up here.

12
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,814
Hang on a minute.

13
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:15,248
Okay, I'm there.

14
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:18,325
Can you confirm it's human?

15
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:21,362
Medicarpal, phalanges...

16
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:23,840
No question about it.

17
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:28,275
Hold on, Nick.

18
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:31,392
There's got to be an easier way.

19
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:33,710
When a body decomposes
in concrete

20
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,267
it leaves an air pocket,
vacuum-sealed.

21
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:38,905
If we do this right, it'll open
like a jar of pickles.

22
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:57,846
Ten bucks says the owner
sells the house.

23
00:01:57,846 --> 00:02:01,083
By law, you've got
to disclose everything...

24
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,121
three bedrooms,
two baths, and a skeleton.

25
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,528
Okay, I'm late again.

26
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:39,245
Nick's going to work with me on that
unidentified body at Summercliff.

27
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:42,242
I hear it's just bones?
What a rush.

28
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:43,641
O.I.S. At the Jockey Club.

29
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:44,720
Officer-involved shooting.

30
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,919
I'll take a piece of that.

31
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,117
Good, I want you to double up.

32
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:48,995
Listen, these deals
are never easy

33
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:50,794
so keep me informed, please.

34
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:52,272
Will do.
- I drive.

35
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:53,471
Picture that.

36
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:56,108
So what do you have for me?

37
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:57,387
I could use a rush.

38
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:59,145
Well, this qualifies, 4-26.

39
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:01,623
But I can't give you the case.

40
00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:03,022
Because?

41
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:04,420
Conflict of interest.

42
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,857
The alleged rape victim's
an exotic dancer.

43
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:14,131
Because I used to be one,
I'll be biased?

44
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:14,810
No.

45
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,648
The suspect's your ex-husband.

46
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:26,678
He's asking for you,
but you can't take it.

47
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:31,993
Just let me do the prelim.

48
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,229
All right.

49
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:37,707
Do what you can.

50
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:41,104
But after the preliminary,
you pass it off, okay?

51
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,277
Thank God you're here.

52
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:09,156
Eddie.

53
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:11,514
I didn't rape that girl.

54
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:14,870
According to the police report
she's telling a different story.

55
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,187
I wonder what the rape kit's
going to say.

56
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:19,706
We had sex, okay?

57
00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:22,503
But she was there with me 100%.

58
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:26,979
In the parking lot
behind the club.

59
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:29,816
Well, some women like
the outdoors.

60
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:33,852
Melanie know about this?

61
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:36,489
Mel and I split up a while ago.

62
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:38,008
You might want to call her
anyway.

63
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:40,445
She can loan you the money
for an attorney.

64
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:41,924
You're not going to help me?

65
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:43,402
Cath, I am in a jam here!

66
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:44,921
A detective from Sex Crime's
been assigned.

67
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:46,359
I'm going to place another CSI.

68
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,278
What about Lindsey?

69
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:50,315
What about her?

70
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:53,312
You want her spending Sunday
afternoons with me

71
00:04:53,312 --> 00:04:56,190
at Nevada State Prison,
or the mall?

72
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:00,625
Based on the auricular surface

73
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:03,942
I'd say she died
when she was about 20.

74
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:06,060
She?

75
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,978
It's in the hips.

76
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:10,455
The pelvic bone is
definitely female.

77
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:11,774
You know, for a ladies' man

78
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:13,373
you don't know much
about bone structure.

79
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:15,650
I know all I need to know.

80
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,209
I figure she was killed

81
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:20,286
before her cement bath.

82
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,604
Yeah, how?

83
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:22,803
She was stabbed

84
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:25,121
at least a dozen times

85
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:27,319
a screwdriver maybe

86
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,278
or a spike.

87
00:05:28,358 --> 00:05:31,235
No, the gouges on her ribs
are unusual.

88
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:34,751
The instrument had to be...
slightly curved

89
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,628
with some kind of serrated edge.

90
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:43,583
Like crocodile teeth.

91
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,821
Whatever killed this girl

92
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:46,700
it was not a traditional weapon.

93
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:50,376
Well, stabbings are personal.

94
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,934
She knew her attacker.

95
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:53,253
That's the rule.

96
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:02,124
Who are you?

97
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:07,719
Sara Sidle, Warrick Brown

98
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:08,838
Officer Joe Tyner.

99
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:09,877
Hi.

100
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:10,756
Hi.

101
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:11,835
Officer Tyner.

102
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,034
How are you doing?

103
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:14,752
Tell us what happened
here tonight.

104
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,071
He responded to shots fired

105
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,549
the suspect fled the scene.

106
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:20,586
Why don't you tell us
what happened here.

107
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:24,822
(tires squealing)

108
00:06:24,822 --> 00:06:27,180
Unit Five. I'm in pursuit
of the fleeing 413

109
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,658
heading southbound on the Strip.

110
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:31,935
(tires squealing)

111
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,851
Get back into the car!

112
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:37,889
Drop your keys to the ground!

113
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:39,128
Put your hands on the wheel!

114
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:40,406
I didn't do it!

115
00:06:40,446 --> 00:06:41,525
Whatever you think I did!

116
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:43,364
I'm looking at three strikes.

117
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,882
I'm not going back.

118
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:45,921
I'll show you my registration.

119
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:47,440
No, put your hands on the wheel!

120
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:48,199
(fires gun)

121
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:48,958
Then he turned

122
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:50,357
the weapon on himself

123
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:52,794
and one shot,
right through the forehead.

124
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:53,793
Where's his gun?

125
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:55,591
I left it in the jeep.

126
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:56,870
I'm going to go bag it.

127
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,908
Officer, we're going to need
your weapon as well.

128
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:00,786
I never fired.

129
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:01,705
Drawn but not fired.

130
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:03,504
It's just standard procedure.

131
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,659
It's okay. It's all right.

132
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:24,922
We're going to need
to seal off this lot.

133
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:27,240
Tyner told you
what happened here.

134
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,639
Whose side are you on?

135
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,878
The officer told me

136
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,436
a fleeing suspect
committed suicide.

137
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:33,154
I'm just verifying his account.

138
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:34,673
You know how this works, Brass.

139
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:36,391
Can we clear the jeep
so I can do my job?

140
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:40,267
Well, at least test the dead
guy's hands for gun residue.

141
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:41,586
At that proximity

142
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:42,905
G.S.R.'s invalid.

143
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:45,102
They'd both be covered,
no matter who fired.

144
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:47,021
Can we get back to work?

145
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:48,060
Yeah.

146
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:54,253
(light buzzing)

147
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,810
(door opens)

148
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:02,325
You brought the foundation
of the house to our lab.

149
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:04,643
It's a six-by-three-foot
section.

150
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:06,761
When the concrete dried

151
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:10,637
it preserved a partial
impression of our Jane Doe.

152
00:08:11,636 --> 00:08:13,874
Did you find out anything
about the house?

153
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:15,153
I pulled the permits.

154
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:17,470
Summercliff was built five years
ago on nothing but desert.

155
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,227
That would explain
why the body was so desiccated.

156
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:23,864
House was sold
subsequent to completion

157
00:08:23,864 --> 00:08:25,742
so the homeowner isn't a suspect.

158
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:28,380
Homicide is running
a missing persons check.

159
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,698
(clears throat)

160
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:35,413
Well, if it wasn't
for a leaky pipe

161
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:38,410
she might have been down there
forever.

162
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,047
I think our killer
was counting on that.

163
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,118
Hey.

164
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:54,314
Why would a guy speed it
all the way down the Strip

165
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:55,992
just to pull over
and cap himself?

166
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:59,589
What are you
getting at, Warrick?

167
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:03,665
Officer's weapon,
Smith and Wesson 5906.

168
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:05,383
Standard issue.

169
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:07,980
One bullet missing.

170
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,298
Nothing standard about that.

171
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,852
Brass isn't going to like this.

172
00:09:16,852 --> 00:09:19,209
I don't give a damn
what Brass likes.

173
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:20,488
Like I do?

174
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:21,967
If Tyner's dirty, he goes down.

175
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:25,763
I just know what happens
when you piss off the P.D.

176
00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:29,599
Yeah, it's war.

177
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:33,555
Gil Grissom?

178
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:38,031
Or should I call you
Spider Man?

179
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:39,230
It's harmless.

180
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:40,388
Of course it is.

181
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:43,905
Orange-kneed tarantula.

182
00:09:43,905 --> 00:09:44,904
Nice specimen.

183
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:48,021
The tarantula's touch
is very gentle.

184
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,140
It leaves no prints.

185
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,178
They move without a trace.

186
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:52,137
May I?

187
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:02,327
Maybe I should introduce myself.

188
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:04,804
Teri Miller does not need
an introduction.

189
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,920
I need you to make me a face.

190
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:13,436
I didn't kill him.
That's what I told IA.

191
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:16,712
It's what I told my superior.
It's what I'm telling you.

192
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:19,350
Officer Tyner, your gun... there's
a bullet's missing from the magazine.

193
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,668
I don't top off.

194
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,106
I know it's against regulation,
but the 14th bullet

195
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:25,504
puts pressure on the spring
and the gun can jam.

196
00:10:25,504 --> 00:10:27,262
Can anyone confirm your story?

197
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:28,381
It's not a story!

198
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:29,779
And no...

199
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:33,216
I don't tell people
how I carry. Do you?

200
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,094
Check the other magazines.

201
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,892
What the hell's going on here?

202
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:39,250
We're just having a talk
with Officer Tyner here.

203
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,047
Next time, don't start without me.
I'm the union rep on this one.

204
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,765
Then you should know.
Tyner's magazine... one bullet shy.

205
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:46,843
Is the expended round
still missing?

206
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:49,000
It's not in the body,
bullet's a round point

207
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,399
wound was a through-and-through.

208
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:51,958
I did not fire a single round.

209
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:53,196
And with a record like yours

210
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,715
we're supposed
to just take your word?

211
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,313
Five civilian complaints...

212
00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:58,991
three for excessive force.

213
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,308
Two IA investigations.

214
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:02,747
I was cleared.

215
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:04,385
I'm sure you were.

216
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:07,622
What is that supposed to mean?
I don't have to take this crap!

217
00:11:07,622 --> 00:11:11,139
Tyner... sit down, sit down.

218
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:14,855
What you do need
is for these guys

219
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:17,053
to go out and find
the missing bullet.

220
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:19,890
So what are you waiting for?

221
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,565
I guess it's a good thing
I sealed off that crime scene.

222
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:31,119
It's like a human Jell-O mold.

223
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:33,037
The impression's only a partial.

224
00:11:33,037 --> 00:11:34,555
It's not going to be easy.

225
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:37,912
They told me you were the top
forensic artist in the country.

226
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:42,308
And Canada. I didn't
say I couldn't do it.

227
00:11:46,224 --> 00:11:47,662
Give me your hand.

228
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:49,700
You'll enjoy this.

229
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,018
It's as much science as art.

230
00:12:14,955 --> 00:12:16,594
It doesn't really
look like anything.

231
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:19,631
No light, no shadows.

232
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:22,148
No shadows, no perspective.

233
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:23,227
Now look.

234
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:31,979
So teach me.

235
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,057
Okay.

236
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:35,615
First I'm finishing off
the plaster mold.

237
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:39,491
We can't give her life
with only half a face.

238
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,849
Although not
actually symmetrical

239
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:43,607
most faces appear that way

240
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,284
and the thin layer of slip

241
00:12:46,324 --> 00:12:49,521
makes the plaster and clay
appear seamless.

242
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:55,555
Her cheekbones and nasal spine

243
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:57,154
indicate Nordic descent.

244
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,991
I've seen a few
Norwegian brunettes

245
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,868
but your girl's
probably a blonde.

246
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:12,978
Brown eyes?

247
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,296
I thought you decided
she was Nordic.

248
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:17,653
But in this country, brown
is a dominant eye color

249
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:19,651
and more importantly,
brown photographs better.

250
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:22,728
You want to get her face
out there, don't you?

251
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,166
Yeah.

252
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,523
I'm sure someone needs closure

253
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:31,040
and somebody else
needs to go to jail.

254
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:35,316
There she is.

255
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:46,705
As we first reported yesterday

256
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:49,222
the remains of an unidentified
Caucasian female

257
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:50,661
were unearthed in Summercliff.

258
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:54,537
The 5'4" woman was
approximately 20 years old.

259
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:55,536
Here you go.

260
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:57,614
Authorities are asking
for the public's help

261
00:13:57,654 --> 00:13:58,972
in identifying the victim.

262
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:00,771
If you have any information

263
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:03,448
please call
the Las Vegas P.D. Hotline.

264
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:06,685
Hotlines... hit or miss.

265
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:08,523
I don't know. In my experience

266
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:11,520
people usually remember
a beautiful woman.

267
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:18,353
Uh, Nick, weren't you going to go

268
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:20,591
and do the, uh... at the...?

269
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:22,189
Yeah.

270
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,747
Yeah, okay, I'll do that.

271
00:14:27,105 --> 00:14:28,783
So I saw Eddie.

272
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:35,536
He actually... seemed scared.

273
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:38,214
Did that make you happy?

274
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:39,213
Um, no.

275
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:43,728
I'm not really sure what I feel.

276
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:48,963
You're not still in love
with Eddie?

277
00:14:50,202 --> 00:14:52,599
Catherine, you have
to hand off the case.

278
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,797
Warrick can just double up.

279
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:57,554
Uh, Grissom,
Dr. Robbins wants to see you.

280
00:14:57,554 --> 00:15:00,192
Something about your skeleton.

281
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,630
Okay.

282
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,621
You have to pass off the case.

283
00:15:11,621 --> 00:15:13,379
If you compromise
the investigation

284
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:14,498
there's no going back.

285
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:15,417
You could hurt Eddie

286
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,135
just as much
as you could help him.

287
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:27,365
Hey. I've already seen
the marks on the ribs.

288
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:28,844
Uh-huh, but did you see

289
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:32,080
the hairline fracture
on the posterior skull?

290
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,239
No.

291
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,195
Easy to miss, but it
screams blunt-force trauma.

292
00:15:37,195 --> 00:15:40,112
Also, the middle ear
has three bones.

293
00:15:40,112 --> 00:15:42,430
They're dusted with sodium

294
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,749
and lodged against the malleus

295
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:47,026
I found a tiny ball of earwax
with grains of sand.

296
00:15:50,063 --> 00:15:51,701
Salt and sand.

297
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:54,498
Killed at the beach?

298
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,576
Not ruling it out.

299
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:58,374
Grissom.

300
00:15:58,414 --> 00:15:59,653
Hey, Doc.

301
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:00,892
Hotline's lit up.

302
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:02,650
Five callers all ID'd

303
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,649
the same woman

304
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,287
and her mother just confirmed.

305
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:13,639
I need to know what happened
to my daughter.

306
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,634
We're trying to figure that
out for you.

307
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:21,152
She was quite an athlete, huh?

308
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:22,590
Mm-hmm, yeah.

309
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:25,228
Did she scuba dive?

310
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:27,545
She'd just been certified.

311
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:28,904
Did, uh, Fay

312
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:32,181
before she disappeared,
go on any vacation

313
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:35,218
go diving or spend
time at the beach?

314
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:37,695
No, not that I recall.

315
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:38,854
And she, uh

316
00:16:38,894 --> 00:16:43,610
lived here with you
until she disappeared?

317
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,609
No, she had just moved

318
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:46,647
in with her boyfriend,
Jason Hendler.

319
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:49,124
He still lives on Medley Place.

320
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:50,363
And the, uh

321
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:54,239
police interviewed him
after she disappeared?

322
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:55,238
A couple of times.

323
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:57,076
He had nothing to do with this.

324
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,594
Well, how do you know that?

325
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:01,632
He loved my daughter.

326
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:03,590
He was good to her.

327
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,666
Did they... ever fight?

328
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,783
The first few months of
a relationship nobody fights.

329
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:17,336
She was crazy about him.

330
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,614
(sobbing)

331
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:30,163
I've given Eddie Willows
20 lap dances.

332
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:32,161
He never got rough
till last night.

333
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,081
In the parking lot.

334
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,479
Yeah, he asked me
to go for drinks

335
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,157
you know,
but out in the parking lot

336
00:17:37,197 --> 00:17:38,635
he starts kissing on me

337
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:41,712
and I kind
of laughed it off, but...

338
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:43,031
then he grabbed me

339
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:46,827
and he slams me against the wall

340
00:17:46,827 --> 00:17:48,865
and... that pig.

341
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:51,303
Hi, Evans

342
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,621
I'm sorry I'm late.

343
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:53,740
I'm Catherine...

344
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,819
just Catherine.

345
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:56,178
I'm a forensic scientist.

346
00:17:56,258 --> 00:18:00,054
Scientist, wow,
you look so normal.

347
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:01,572
Thanks.

348
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:03,371
Catherine, you sure want...?

349
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:05,369
Yeah.

350
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,765
Are those bruises
from last night?

351
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:12,482
Yeah, a guy pinned me
against a wall.

352
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,400
Sexual assault nurse
collect a kit yet?

353
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,439
She just finished.

354
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:16,757
Why don't you see
if you can catch her.

355
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:19,555
I'd like her to get a sample
from under her fingernails.

356
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:25,469
Uh... what kind of sample?

357
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:29,065
Anything that might, uh,
show up from a... a struggle.

358
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:33,541
You'd think what that nurse took
down below would be enough.

359
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:37,697
The weird thing is...

360
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:39,735
I liked the guy.

361
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:51,243
It's not here.

362
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:53,961
Bullets just don't disappear.

363
00:18:53,961 --> 00:18:55,119
Excuse me.

364
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:57,797
No one's allowed inside the tape.

365
00:18:57,797 --> 00:18:58,876
I saw what happened.

366
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:02,832
Have you talked to the police?

367
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:04,550
Police make me nervous.

368
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,788
You guys aren't cops, are you?

369
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:08,826
We're crime scene investigators.

370
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,864
We need to know what you saw.

371
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:14,740
I was kind of taking a break,
hanging out in a PT Cruiser.

372
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,056
I was laid back in the heated
driver's seat when I heard the siren.

373
00:19:19,056 --> 00:19:20,494
(siren blaring)

374
00:19:20,574 --> 00:19:22,812
Put your hands on the wheel!

375
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:24,211
I didn't do it!

376
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:25,809
Whatever you think I did!

377
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:29,046
Man, I'm looking at three strikes.
I'm not going back.

378
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:31,204
Just let me show you
my registration.

379
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,602
No! Hands on the wheel!

380
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,358
And just like that,
the officer fired?

381
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:38,556
Just like that.

382
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:41,314
Missing bullet, eyewitness...

383
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,151
we better tell Grissom
we got a war.

384
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,938
I heard about your eyewitness.

385
00:19:57,018 --> 00:20:00,375
A valet who joyrides.

386
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,574
He sounds reliable.

387
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:04,371
So, uh, how's the thing going

388
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,969
on Eddie Willows?

389
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:06,848
What thing?

390
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:08,127
The thing that

391
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,366
I told Catherine

392
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:10,844
to pass off to you.

393
00:20:10,924 --> 00:20:11,684
Oh, good, um...

394
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:15,160
We just put some stuff
through the lab.

395
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,719
Get hold of the DMV?

396
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,317
I was just about to.

397
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:21,993
Warrick? Why would
you call the DMV

398
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:22,873
on a rape charge?

399
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,187
Okay, I didn't hand it off.

400
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:29,546
Really?

401
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:30,865
I'm sorry, Warrick.

402
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:33,662
If you want me to suave anyone,
I've got to know the shot.

403
00:20:33,662 --> 00:20:35,820
I know. I'm sorry.

404
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:40,415
I'm doing this for Lindsey.

405
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:43,372
You so much as breathe on the
evidence, it's contaminated

406
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:44,851
and I end up the bad guy.

407
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:46,849
Eyes, no hands.

408
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:48,247
What's the status?

409
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:51,604
Skin samples from under
the woman's fingernails

410
00:20:51,604 --> 00:20:53,522
are consistent with Ed's.

411
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:56,040
I saw some bruises

412
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,916
but Eddie's style
has always been very...

413
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,275
involved...

414
00:21:01,315 --> 00:21:02,553
vigorous.

415
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:03,592
Vigorous?

416
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,949
She's trying to tell you
Eddie likes it rough.

417
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,467
Thank you, Warrick.

418
00:21:08,507 --> 00:21:10,985
Eddie said that
she was into it.

419
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:12,344
He said, she said?

420
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:14,142
It's about the evidence,
Catherine.

421
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:18,537
And you may not like
where it takes you.

422
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,253
So how many grains of sand

423
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,611
in the ocean, huh?

424
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:27,928
I don't care about the ocean,
just the sand in my skeleton.

425
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:29,527
Can you pinpoint a beach?

426
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:30,486
I don't know.

427
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:31,605
I might have to do
some field research.

428
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:34,002
Hey, you think Grissom
would send me to Hawaii?

429
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,639
Why don't you ask him yourself?

430
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:40,036
Ask me what?

431
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:41,155
Oh, nothing, I, uh...

432
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:43,553
I was just telling
Nick about your sand.

433
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:45,711
Well, it's not sand.

434
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,790
It's not natural anyway.

435
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:48,028
Here, check this out.

436
00:21:49,427 --> 00:21:52,424
Now, if this were natural sand,
the surface would be smooth.

437
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:54,901
Now this looks more
like Fremont Street

438
00:21:54,901 --> 00:21:56,460
on a Saturday night...

439
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,619
rough.

440
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,257
Could the particles be
sediment from the concrete

441
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:00,616
where we found her?

442
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:01,935
No, no way.

443
00:22:01,974 --> 00:22:04,732
I analyzed the mineral content.
It's feldspar and quartz.

444
00:22:04,772 --> 00:22:07,009
That's crushed gray sandstone.

445
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:09,607
It's man-made,
in a rock crusher.

446
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:10,566
What does that mean?

447
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:13,243
It means she wasn't killed
in Hawaii.

448
00:22:13,243 --> 00:22:15,121
Other than that...

449
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:16,520
he has no idea.

450
00:22:20,476 --> 00:22:22,794
Is this payback, Warrick?
Is that what this is?

451
00:22:22,794 --> 00:22:25,271
I was tough on you,
so Officer Tyner takes my heat?

452
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:26,710
That's how you think I work?

453
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,708
Brass, this has nothing
to do with anything.

454
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:29,907
The D.A. Has filed charges

455
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:32,025
and on the testimony of
a bleary-eyed car jockey

456
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:33,423
who was 40 feet from the jeep.

457
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:36,460
Eyewitness is a bonus:
Your cop's magazine

458
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,619
was one bullet shy.

459
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:39,497
That's you CSls,
always counting bullets.

460
00:22:39,497 --> 00:22:41,296
What's he doing here?

461
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:45,372
You show up with your latex gloves
and your little fancy metal boxes

462
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:46,650
and your little powders...

463
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,367
You have no idea what it's like
to put your life on the line

464
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:51,446
every day!

465
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:54,323
Oh, you mean dealing
with punk-ass cops who hide

466
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:55,402
behind their union reps?

467
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:56,161
Hey!

468
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,399
You're just a psycho.

469
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:00,317
You don't deserve a badge.

470
00:23:00,397 --> 00:23:01,156
Cut it out!

471
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:02,754
Not in my lab, pal.

472
00:23:02,794 --> 00:23:03,793
Scientists!

473
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:08,189
I bet you've never
even drawn your weapon.

474
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:09,108
Yeah, I hope I never have to.

475
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:10,786
Nick, walk this guy
out the door.

476
00:23:10,826 --> 00:23:12,984
Now, let's go.

477
00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:13,624
Sara.

478
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:15,462
Yeah, come on, Warrick.

479
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:16,461
Let's cool down.

480
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,460
This is your fault, Gil.

481
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,778
Your nose is so
far down a microscope

482
00:23:18,818 --> 00:23:20,737
you have no idea
what your people are doing.

483
00:23:20,737 --> 00:23:23,094
Yeah, I know one thing:
My guys will not bend

484
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:24,733
and they will not
be intimidated.

485
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:26,171
Yeah, I sat in your chair.

486
00:23:26,211 --> 00:23:28,409
Your guys have one job:
To find the evidence.

487
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:31,446
So where the hell
is the missing bullet?

488
00:23:31,446 --> 00:23:32,685
Huh?

489
00:23:54,903 --> 00:23:57,021
Eddie?

490
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,979
Catherine.

491
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,177
I'll take a root beer.

492
00:24:01,177 --> 00:24:03,175
What are you doing here?

493
00:24:03,214 --> 00:24:04,653
I knew you'd be here.

494
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,850
You got a routine:
Turkey club, no bacon.

495
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:11,127
You could be a detective.

496
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,725
Thank you.

497
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:13,564
(sighs)

498
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:15,922
Well, you obviously made bail.

499
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:17,001
Did you get a lawyer?

500
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:20,158
I got you and the truth.
Who needs a lawyer?

501
00:24:24,993 --> 00:24:28,150
I came to tell you
how great you are.

502
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,748
It always comes out wrong.

503
00:24:29,788 --> 00:24:33,305
When I married you, I married up.

504
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,863
I know that.

505
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:43,175
It wasn't all bad.

506
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:55,563
You think the bullet's
somewhere in the jeep.

507
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:56,921
It's not in the body.

508
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:59,998
It's not at the crime scene.

509
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,235
I like our odds.

510
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,153
Let's do it.

511
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,138
(wrench grinding)

512
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:37,841
(metal clanging)

513
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:47,192
We have searched every
single piece of metal.

514
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:48,910
I think hide and seek is over.

515
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,627
(sighing)

516
00:25:51,627 --> 00:25:52,506
Yeah.

517
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:56,143
We've searched every
piece of metal.

518
00:26:01,178 --> 00:26:03,216
Spare tire.

519
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:21,677
You've got to be kidding me.

520
00:26:21,677 --> 00:26:23,116
The tire sucked up the bullet

521
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:24,475
and the treads covered its tracks.

522
00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:28,511
We match the bullet to the cop's gun,
the case is airtight.

523
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:30,149
There's a match.

524
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:33,306
We got Tyner.

525
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:34,864
One bad cop going down.

526
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:38,381
Well, actually, Warrick, the evidence
round wasn't from the cop's gun.

527
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:40,938
It was from the suspect's.

528
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:42,577
No way.

529
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:44,495
(hard rock music)

530
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:53,526
These guys never give up
anything on their girls.

531
00:26:53,526 --> 00:26:55,924
Well, let me give it a try.

532
00:26:55,924 --> 00:26:56,963
Excuse me, sir.

533
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:58,361
Can we see your permits?

534
00:26:58,441 --> 00:26:59,400
Oh, hi, gorgeous.

535
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,639
How are you?

536
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,518
Okay, Ted.

537
00:27:01,598 --> 00:27:02,597
How are you doing?

538
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:03,476
I'm okay.
- Hi.

539
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:05,234
You should've seen
this lady dance.

540
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:06,113
Was she good!

541
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:07,552
You still working with the cops?

542
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:10,589
Can't seem to get
off the night shift.

543
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:11,708
You dressed like that?

544
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:14,146
If you want to
call that dressed.

545
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:16,503
Yeah, Evans.

546
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:19,620
Hey, Ted, you heard
about this thing

547
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,899
with Eddie and April?

548
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:23,936
Yeah, the night guy
told me about it.

549
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:26,333
Boy, Eddie never changes, huh?

550
00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:35,644
Bring back memories?

551
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:41,638
You mind if I look around?

552
00:27:41,678 --> 00:27:42,957
Help yourself.

553
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:43,876
Thanks, Ted.

554
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:37,183
(doorbell rings)

555
00:28:37,223 --> 00:28:38,382
Can I help you?

556
00:28:38,462 --> 00:28:41,060
Ma'am, my name is Gil Grissom.
This is Nick Stokes.

557
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,458
Honey, who's out there?

558
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:44,496
Mr. Hendler, we're criminalists

559
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:47,173
from the Las Vegas
Police Department.

560
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:48,252
What's this about?

561
00:28:48,332 --> 00:28:49,251
We're investigating

562
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:52,169
the disappearance of Fay Green.

563
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:53,407
May we come in?

564
00:28:55,645 --> 00:28:57,004
Yes.

565
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:01,959
Thank you.

566
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,309
Did you find her?

567
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:14,347
Yes, I'm afraid we did.

568
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:18,542
She'd been dead for quite a while.

569
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:19,541
Hmm.

570
00:29:23,418 --> 00:29:24,656
You always hope...

571
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:28,053
Mr. Hendler?

572
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,611
Would it be possible
for us to look around?

573
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:34,367
Fay only lived here for about
a month, five years ago.

574
00:29:36,764 --> 00:29:39,042
I've got nothing to hide.

575
00:29:39,082 --> 00:29:40,521
Thank you.

576
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:41,520
Thanks.

577
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:17,124
A trigger and a lionfish.

578
00:30:17,124 --> 00:30:18,923
Yeah, that's right.

579
00:30:18,963 --> 00:30:20,641
Interesting choices.

580
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:23,798
Violent, carnivorous predators.

581
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:29,792
(floor squeaks)

582
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,414
It's just a warped floorboard.

583
00:30:47,454 --> 00:30:48,733
It's been like that forever.

584
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:53,768
Mr. Hendler, at any time,
was your fish tank over here?

585
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,046
Maybe, a while ago, why?

586
00:30:56,086 --> 00:30:58,204
Did it ever overflow?

587
00:30:58,204 --> 00:30:59,483
Or break?

588
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:00,801
Not that I recall.

589
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:03,359
You said I could
look anywhere, right?

590
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,397
Yeah.

591
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,395
Got a pocket knife?

592
00:31:14,388 --> 00:31:15,467
What are you doing?

593
00:31:15,547 --> 00:31:17,784
Pops out, pops in.

594
00:31:26,975 --> 00:31:29,533
What do you find
inside an hourglass?

595
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:38,963
Mr. Hendler, I think
the tank was over here.

596
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,562
I think it broke.

597
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:43,559
I think you got water
and artificial sand

598
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,878
all over the place.

599
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:47,755
I'd like you fellows
to leave now, please.

600
00:31:47,755 --> 00:31:49,193
Fine, we'll go.

601
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:50,792
We'll be back...

602
00:31:50,832 --> 00:31:52,150
with a warrant.

603
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:00,382
So what did the rape kit say?

604
00:32:00,422 --> 00:32:03,899
Nonoxynol-9,
polyvinyl alcohol, and...

605
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:04,738
Glycerin?

606
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:05,937
Yeah.

607
00:32:05,977 --> 00:32:08,494
It's a contraceptive film.

608
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:11,491
What are you drinking?

609
00:32:11,571 --> 00:32:12,330
Chamomile.

610
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,489
May I?
- Sure.

611
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:14,249
Thank you.

612
00:32:15,807 --> 00:32:18,444
So you used to work at
the French Palace, huh?

613
00:32:18,444 --> 00:32:19,803
That's right.

614
00:32:19,843 --> 00:32:22,720
My friends and I used to go there.
- Really?

615
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,199
Payday Fridays.
- Uh-huh.

616
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:26,916
Maybe I saw you perform?

617
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:27,955
Oh, I doubt it.

618
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:28,674
Why?

619
00:32:28,754 --> 00:32:31,152
You would've remembered.

620
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,148
So, this film

621
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:36,187
it's kind of hard to detect

622
00:32:36,227 --> 00:32:38,145
because it dissolves
with body heat.

623
00:32:38,145 --> 00:32:40,223
And, as you know, Greg

624
00:32:40,223 --> 00:32:42,301
sex can make a body pretty hot.

625
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,018
This stuff has to be inserted

626
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:48,015
15 minutes to three hours
before sex.

627
00:32:48,015 --> 00:32:48,854
Which means that

628
00:32:48,974 --> 00:32:50,173
April inserted the film

629
00:32:50,253 --> 00:32:52,051
while she was still at work.

630
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:53,370
But how could she have known

631
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,728
to put the birth control in
before she was raped?

632
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,286
Exactly.

633
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,196
Guess where Jason Hendler
was employed five years ago?

634
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:09,913
Summercliff housing development.

635
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:11,392
A plumber, perhaps?

636
00:33:11,432 --> 00:33:13,110
Close. A subcontractor.

637
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,109
How'd you know?

638
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:16,027
Why else would you be so excited?

639
00:33:17,426 --> 00:33:18,025
Hey!

640
00:33:18,105 --> 00:33:19,584
You weren't going to say

641
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,703
good-bye to me?

642
00:33:20,783 --> 00:33:22,821
I'll meet you outside.

643
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:26,497
Thought I'd let you off easy.

644
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,535
But I did tack up my number

645
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:31,492
on your big fish corkboard...

646
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:32,891
Under "cold cases."

647
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:35,288
The ones that got away.

648
00:33:35,328 --> 00:33:36,567
Let's hope not.

649
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,039
So, check it out...

650
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:48,076
the laser is the path
of the bullet.

651
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:51,313
If you were Officer Tyner

652
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:52,951
and you approached the suspect

653
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,109
from the driver's side
of the vehicle...

654
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:55,868
Vic was shot

655
00:33:55,948 --> 00:33:56,827
in the frontal lobe

656
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:57,786
through the windshield.

657
00:33:58,106 --> 00:33:58,865
There's no way I
could shoot the guy

658
00:33:58,985 --> 00:34:01,103
from here and mimic
that trajectory.

659
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:03,181
The laws of physics
trump the eyewitness.

660
00:34:03,181 --> 00:34:05,419
There's only one way
this could've gone down.

661
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,458
...show you my registration.

662
00:34:06,537 --> 00:34:08,775
No! Put your hands on the wheel!

663
00:34:08,775 --> 00:34:09,694
(gunshot)

664
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:10,933
Officer Tyner
was telling the truth.

665
00:34:10,973 --> 00:34:13,970
So I bet you think
I owe you one, huh?

666
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,128
We work. We get paid.

667
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:17,447
You don't owe me anything.

668
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:20,324
Fine with me.

669
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:24,360
He promised me a million things.

670
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,559
I got tired of him lying.

671
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:27,277
Like what, marriage, kids?

672
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,236
Music videos.

673
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:29,794
He kept telling me
he'd put me in one

674
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,153
but he never delivered.

675
00:34:31,872 --> 00:34:34,270
And for that you
set him up for rape?

676
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,269
(sighs)

677
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:37,187
No, it wasn't supposed
to go this far, okay?

678
00:34:37,227 --> 00:34:38,546
I got this friend
over at the Trop.

679
00:34:38,586 --> 00:34:40,424
She got this high roller
on a rape charge.

680
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:42,462
He paid a ton
to make it go away.

681
00:34:42,502 --> 00:34:45,819
Wait a minute. You think
that Eddie's got money?

682
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:48,176
He is in the music business.

683
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:50,294
He reps some bands Off-Strip.

684
00:34:50,294 --> 00:34:52,572
No, I met a producer
friend of his from L.A.

685
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:57,767
And he's always throwing
money around this place.

686
00:34:57,767 --> 00:35:01,123
(laughs)

687
00:35:01,123 --> 00:35:03,121
What?

688
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:06,398
What's so funny?

689
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,397
Nothing.

690
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:11,034
Unless they're trying
to hide something?

691
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:18,666
I see you've cleaned house.
I thought you might.

692
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:19,945
I vacuumed up the sand.
Big deal.

693
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:21,823
Will you at least tell me
what you're doing here?

694
00:35:23,062 --> 00:35:24,580
I'm working, sir.

695
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,698
Officer, would you hit
the lights, please?

696
00:35:31,613 --> 00:35:32,532
You're getting my floor wet.

697
00:35:32,612 --> 00:35:35,929
It's luminol, sir.
It dries quickly.

698
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,125
Surface is non-reactive.

699
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:43,362
I know what you're doing.
You're looking for blood.

700
00:35:43,362 --> 00:35:45,799
My husband didn't do anything.

701
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:47,038
Why are you harassing him?

702
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,117
Let's try the ALS.

703
00:35:48,197 --> 00:35:49,835
Why use the alternate light source

704
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,953
if the luminol didn't
pick up anything?

705
00:35:51,993 --> 00:35:53,032
Luminol works on the surface

706
00:35:53,112 --> 00:35:55,989
ALS chases the protein
molecules in blood.

707
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,548
It actually penetrates the wood.

708
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,705
These floorboards are
all made of maple.

709
00:35:59,705 --> 00:36:02,862
High-end, but
they've been lacquered.

710
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,979
Who lacquers maple

711
00:36:27,158 --> 00:36:28,557
Turn it off, Nick.

712
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:32,313
Officer, hit the lights, please.

713
00:36:32,313 --> 00:36:34,191
Mr. Hendler

714
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:36,829
let me tell you
what I think happened to Fay.

715
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:38,028
On the night
of her disappearance

716
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:40,026
the two of you
got in a heated argument.

717
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:42,064
Don't you walk away from me!

718
00:36:47,178 --> 00:36:50,295
Suffering a concussion,
Fay falls to the floor.

719
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:51,894
In the heat of the moment

720
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:53,572
you decide to make it final.

721
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,650
But Fay surprises you:
She fights back.

722
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,048
She pushes you off.
She crawls a few feet away

723
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:00,126
and you move in
for the final attack.

724
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:06,120
One thing that I don't know though

725
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,757
what did you use to kill her?

726
00:37:08,757 --> 00:37:10,875
I didn't kill her.

727
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:12,673
Well, whatever the weapon

728
00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:14,272
it wasn't a knife, but it worked.

729
00:37:14,312 --> 00:37:16,230
You drove her body
over to Summercliff

730
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,229
where you were employed

731
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,306
the Summercliff job
less than a week.

732
00:37:20,386 --> 00:37:22,264
Ask Amy; she worked
for the same contractor.

733
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,382
That's right.
He got a better job

734
00:37:24,382 --> 00:37:25,501
in Reno.

735
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,539
Jason wasn't even in Vegas
when Fay disappeared.

736
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,136
Yeah, you painted the floors,
covered your tracks

737
00:37:30,136 --> 00:37:32,054
for what, aesthetic reasons?

738
00:37:32,054 --> 00:37:33,972
Five years is a long time

739
00:37:33,972 --> 00:37:36,689
but eventually the past
catches up to everybody.

740
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:37,968
I didn't kill Fay!

741
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:40,126
I loved her. I still love her.

742
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:50,915
Amy, I'm sorry.

743
00:37:50,955 --> 00:37:53,513
I'm sorry.

744
00:37:53,553 --> 00:37:56,550
You still love her?

745
00:37:58,828 --> 00:38:00,746
Officer, would you please

746
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:02,144
arrest Mr. Hendler?

747
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,098
Call my father.
He'll get a lawyer.

748
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:16,011
I'll ride along with the cops.

749
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,409
Bring Homicide up to speed.

750
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:19,847
This is now a fresh crime scene.

751
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:20,926
I'll get to work.

752
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:46,980
"...the instrument had
to be slightly curved

753
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,176
"with some kind of serrated edge

754
00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:52,854
like crocodile teeth..."

755
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:57,370
Mrs. Hendler, do you and your
husband do much rock climbing?

756
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,568
(gun cocks)
Yes.

757
00:38:58,688 --> 00:39:01,166
That's what I killed her with.

758
00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:05,881
I can prove I was in Reno
when Fay disappeared.

759
00:39:05,881 --> 00:39:08,838
I've got records.

760
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:10,716
You don't want to talk, fine.

761
00:39:10,756 --> 00:39:13,154
But I've got a question for you.

762
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:14,992
Why do you care so much
about the floors?

763
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:17,550
I mean, Amy paints them
every spring.

764
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,948
It's no big deal.

765
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:28,259
Jason was in Reno.

766
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:30,377
I came here to tell Fay

767
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:35,132
that we would be
together again one day.

768
00:39:35,132 --> 00:39:37,929
Mrs. Hendler, put the gun down.

769
00:39:37,929 --> 00:39:40,447
Do you know he was engaged to me
when he met her?

770
00:39:40,487 --> 00:39:42,405
Where are you going?

771
00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:42,965
Stop it!

772
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:50,237
There was blood everywhere.

773
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:56,711
No one else could see it.

774
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:59,188
But I knew it was there.

775
00:40:02,185 --> 00:40:05,023
A dead body is so heavy.

776
00:40:05,023 --> 00:40:09,818
Mrs. Hendler,
I'm a good listener.

777
00:40:09,818 --> 00:40:11,576
You've got to give me the gun.

778
00:40:11,656 --> 00:40:13,454
I can't!

779
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:17,051
I'm sorry.

780
00:40:17,131 --> 00:40:18,010
No, wait.

781
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,608
But you arrested my husband.

782
00:40:19,648 --> 00:40:20,527
Wait!

783
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:21,846
Mrs. Hendler.

784
00:40:21,926 --> 00:40:23,165
Nick, don't move.

785
00:40:23,245 --> 00:40:24,603
Please.

786
00:40:24,643 --> 00:40:27,720
I don't want to fire my gun
any more than you do.

787
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:31,197
For five years,

788
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:33,235
you've been washing
the blood off your hands.

789
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:39,109
Let's put down the guns.

790
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,729
You okay, Nick?

791
00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:01,567
Yeah.

792
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:02,486
Come on.

793
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,219
Morning.

794
00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:31,257
(bike bell rings)

795
00:41:31,297 --> 00:41:32,896
Morning.

796
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:36,732
Please don't tell me

797
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:38,210
that you're in trouble
again already.

798
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,648
You weren't home.
I figured you'd be here.

799
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:41,567
Lindsey loves this park.

800
00:41:43,645 --> 00:41:46,123
So, I thought I'd take you
out to breakfast.

801
00:41:46,123 --> 00:41:47,561
Say thank you.

802
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:48,560
You're welcome.

803
00:41:52,436 --> 00:41:54,834
I don't think that's
such a good idea, though.

804
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:02,986
Cath, when are we going to talk
about what happened between us?

805
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:07,302
What's to talk about?

806
00:42:07,302 --> 00:42:09,380
You cheated on me.

807
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,857
I caught you.

808
00:42:11,857 --> 00:42:13,615
I've got a new life.

809
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:19,010
Cath...

810
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,607
Come on...

811
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:26,003
why do you fight
the one thing we're good at?

812
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:28,800
Daddy!

813
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,959
Daddy!

814
00:42:32,437 --> 00:42:34,395
There's my little girl.
