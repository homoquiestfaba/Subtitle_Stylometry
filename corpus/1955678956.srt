1
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,066
Speak.

2
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:58,400
Jeff, it's Linda.

3
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,007
Jefferson, I Know you're there.

4
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,707
Okay, you sit. I'll talk .

5
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:05,642
Jerry and I were wondering...

6
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:08,311
if you'll come down to Denver
for Thanksgiving.

7
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:10,718
And you can't use last year's excuse.

8
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,484
You're not the only ranger in Colorado.

9
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:18,184
One last thing. Would you please look
for that Elizabeth Blane cookbook...

10
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,060
that I gave you for your birthday?

11
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:23,396
Bring it, okay?
You may not need it, but I do.

12
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,360
Thanks. Call us.

13
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,968
Did I mention this is your sister Linda?

14
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:38,776
In the last hour, experts predict...

15
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,342
this should be the biggest storm
to hit the Rockies in the last decade.

16
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,948
More than 4 feet of snow is anticipated
to blanket the area in the next 48 hours.

17
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:50,285
Speak.

18
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:53,524
Jeff, it's Captain Marsh
from the Base Station. Are you there?

19
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,432
Some kid's wandered off from his cabin.
It's about half a mile from your place.

20
00:02:57,502 --> 00:02:59,902
-His parents are very upset.
-Obviously.

21
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,495
I'm glad you're there.

22
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:04,701
Do you mind taking a look around
before the storm kicks up?

23
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:07,677
-How long has the kid been gone?
-Six hours.

24
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,507
-Six hours?
-Yeah, a long time.

25
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:12,672
l'm on my way.

26
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:16,315
Okay? You get a big opener.

27
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:18,385
All the way around.

28
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:21,983
Then you pour it in here,
you pretend like you're a cook. lt's terrific.

29
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,654
Children just love watching you work,
you know?

30
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,527
Last night, my grandson, he's 7 years old...

31
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,760
we had the most wonderful evening.

32
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,235
We prepared dinner for the entire family.
We had such a wonderful time.

33
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:36,273
l wanna look at these potatoes now,
see how they look.

34
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:40,744
Look at that. Look at my potatoes.
Aren't they beautiful?

35
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:43,140
l'm gonna teach you the secret ingredient.

36
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:45,705
What you do before serving these...

37
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:48,877
is you take some fresh mint...

38
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:52,081
some parsley, some olive oil, okay?

39
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:55,790
You grind yourself up
a beautiful mint pesto.

40
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,788
-We call--
-Cut! What are you talking about?

41
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,229
l thought we went through this
three months ago.

42
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:03,563
-What?
-No more pesto.

43
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:05,694
What should we call it? That's what it is.

44
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,034
l don't care what it is. Don't call it ''pesto.''

45
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:11,007
All right, what would l call mint and....
What is it, Josie?

46
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:12,940
-Olive oil.
-What would l call that?

47
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:16,913
-Anything but ''pesto.'' Pesto is passé.
-Pesto is passé?

48
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:20,508
That's the kind of concept that keeps
Oprah ahead of us in the ratings.

49
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:22,951
-Oprah never thinks pesto.
-What does she think?

50
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:25,216
She thinks purée.

51
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:26,688
-Purée?
-Purée.

52
00:04:26,758 --> 00:04:31,195
Purée is timeless. lt's traditional.
And tradition is very big right now.

53
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:33,924
l want that snow
to be a little more emotional.

54
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:37,126
You're not shaking it enough.
Would you put your head down?

55
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:39,931
All right, you guys, clear out. Let's go!

56
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:42,532
-ls the tie okay?
-You are a goddess.

57
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:44,097
Thank you very much.

58
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:47,008
-Too much lipstick?
-All right, everybody, action.

59
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:52,375
So now, just before serving your potatoes,
you toss them with a little mint purée.

60
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,078
My husband just loves mint.
He grows it in our garden.

61
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:58,088
lt tastes so good
and it smells so nice, too.

62
00:04:58,489 --> 00:04:59,979
lsn't that pretty?

63
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:01,821
We're gonna set that aside...

64
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:05,192
because we're gonna move on
to our piéce de résistance.:

65
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,958
Thanksgiving turkey.

66
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:08,931
Will you work on that turkey, please?

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,867
-l love smoking our turkey.
-Put a little more color.

68
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,233
Make it shiny. Right.

69
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:15,465
You see, everyone isn't as lucky as me...

70
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,236
to have your son-in-law build you
your very own smokehouse.

71
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:19,503
Don't you worry about that...

72
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:21,568
because you can recreate
that smoky flavor...

73
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:25,104
by adding these soaked hickory chips,
just like that.

74
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:30,519
Now when we come back,
we're gonna see how that all turned out.

75
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,983
Cut. Perfect! Turkey in!

76
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,219
Turkey out!

77
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,024
Let's go, everybody. This is showtime!

78
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,962
-You were double delicious.
-Was it okay?

79
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:42,829
-You were magnificent.
-Thank you.

80
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,834
Who is this guy?
l've never seen him before.

81
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:47,632
Let's go. Too much snow. Calm it down.

82
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:51,664
All right, everybody, out!
Let's go. This is showtime.

83
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:53,810
Get them out.

84
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,503
Action.

85
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,175
All right, here we are, four hours later.
Let's see how our turkey looks.

86
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,413
Those hickory chips sure pack a wallop,
don't they?

87
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,955
But l think we can get....

88
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,853
Look at our bird!
Our bird looks so beautiful.

89
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:13,863
All brown and crunchy on the outside,
and juicy and moist on the inside...

90
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:16,161
after hours and hours of basting.

91
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:19,101
l just hope your family enjoys it
as much as mine.

92
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,434
So from all of mine to all of yours...

93
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:26,000
good health, good eating, goodbye,
and Happy Thanksgiving!

94
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:28,638
Cut. What a great show!

95
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:31,443
-Elizabeth, you were magnificent.
-Was l? Thank you.

96
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,917
And that turkey. What a beautiful turkey!
You were all great.

97
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:36,920
Okay, on to 149.

98
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,951
Did somebody's cat die?
Let's go, everybody.

99
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,493
Nobody's going anywhere but me.
l'm going home.

100
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:46,291
First of all, l just wanna thank you all.
Every one of you.

101
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,888
The best crew l've ever worked with.

102
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:51,128
Go home. Be with your family.
Happy Thanksgiving!

103
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:56,234
Oh, boy.

104
00:06:56,307 --> 00:06:58,673
Hiya, Mike. Are you okay today?

105
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:01,610
...six days of finding the ranger
and the little boy.

106
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:04,477
Here at the hospital
we spoke to two medicaI experts...

107
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,178
both of whom feeI that while it's possible
they may still be alive...

108
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:10,447
we can expect severe dehydration.

109
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,580
Elizabeth. Hey, wait.

110
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:15,023
lf you don't have any plans
for Thanksgiving....

111
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:17,856
l mean, Tyler and l
have this super-big turkey.

112
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:20,193
Thank you so much.
l'd really love to, but....

113
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:21,288
No.

114
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:24,698
-You upset with me?
-No. You, a goddess? Please.

115
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,963
l just wish you'd go somewhere
for the holidays.

116
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,472
l will be somewhere. l'll be home.

117
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:33,599
-Don't you ever get lonely?
-l'm around people all day.

118
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:37,011
No, not that kind of lonely.
You know, lonely.

119
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,979
l mean, look at you.
l'd kill to look like that.

120
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:42,349
l'm just not interested in a relationship
right now.

121
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,581
l mean, l'm not
not interested in a relationship.

122
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:49,217
lt's just that l like things the way they are,
all simple and uncomplicated.

123
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,727
You cannot con me, Elizabeth.
Everyone wants someone special.

124
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:56,233
l had someone special, Josie.
l had my husband, you know.

125
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,463
When he died, it wasn't special anymore.
lt just hurt.

126
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,037
Look at that.

127
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:04,405
l've been looking for one just like that.

128
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:07,677
-This one?
-No, that there.

129
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:09,235
This one here?

130
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,075
What?

131
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:19,049
-Got you.
-l can't.

132
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,033
You okay? l got you.

133
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:37,663
lt's okay. You're safe.

134
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:46,515
Hang on, Billy. Hang on, partner.

135
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:50,115
lt's gonna be okay.

136
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,591
Norah, l'm home. Sorry l'm late.

137
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,504
l have your dinner
warming in the oven, Mrs. B.

138
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:10,199
Thank you, Norah.

139
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:12,667
-Mrs. B.
-What?

140
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,141
You didn't.

141
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:19,148
Norah, of course l didn't.
l made a promise, didn't l?

142
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:22,515
l said no more spending
until after New Year's. l wouldn't....

143
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:25,384
What are you looking at me like that for?

144
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:28,819
No, now look at me.
l'm clean, l don't have a bag on me.

145
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:32,294
Listen, l'm certain that
you've got pumpkin or turkey...

146
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,694
to get ready for Thanksgiving.

147
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:36,961
-Why don't you go on home?
-Anything you say, Mrs. B.

148
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,559
-Sure you don't need me tomorrow?
-l'm sure l don't.

149
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:42,435
Happy Thanksgiving, Norah.
See you Friday.

150
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,751
All right, easy.

151
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:14,024
-l'll take the kid.
-Dad.

152
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,969
Thank you for saving my boy.

153
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:34,115
lt's a scene all of America
has been waiting for.

154
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:37,552
Park Ranger Jefferson Jones
and 5-year-old Billy Futterman...

155
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:41,022
have been found safe
after being lost for nearly a week.

156
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,457
For those of you who just tuned in,
we're looking at live footage...

157
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:47,463
of Jefferson Jones' safe return
with the little boy.

158
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:49,897
They're on their way now
to Memorial Hospital. ..

159
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:51,935
where Sam Simon is standing by.

160
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,300
After today, there isn't a person alive...

161
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:56,839
who won't know the name
Jefferson Jones.

162
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:58,841
Not since the Lindbergh kidnapping...

163
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:01,139
not since the rescue of Baby Jessica...

164
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:03,908
has there been so much interest
in a news event.

165
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:07,508
Every TVnetwork, every news service
has picked up the story.

166
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:10,577
And television ratings have tripled
in the last few hours.

167
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:13,882
Television ratings have tripled.

168
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,226
Body of Christ.

169
00:12:17,294 --> 00:12:20,320
Think America. Think Christmas.
Think 40-share rating.

170
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:23,059
-He pushed me. l was next.
-Sir, this is a holy place.

171
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:26,567
Let's go live now to Memorial HospitaI
to Sam Simon.

172
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:28,963
Sam, what's going on there?

173
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:32,304
They're bringing Jefferson Jones
into the hospital now.

174
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,970
As you might imagine,
there's much to be thankful for...

175
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,342
on this Thanksgiving night.

176
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:39,712
Jones and the little boy are both doing
as well as can be expected...

177
00:12:39,783 --> 00:12:41,478
and we've been told that Jones said...

178
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,180
he's looking forward
to his first hot-cooked meal.

179
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:46,815
The paramedics are opening
the ambulance doors now.

180
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,860
And there's Jefferson Jones
about to step out.

181
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:52,521
He looks pretty good
after six days of starvation...

182
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:54,860
and those freezing temperatures.
But look at him.

183
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:59,130
He's still concerned about Billy's welfare.
What a man. What a hero.

184
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:01,398
Jefferson Jones and the boy....

185
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:04,934
You get the idea?

186
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:08,877
Alex, you woke me up to show me this?
l admit, the ranger's a real hero.

187
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:11,813
-But what's that got to do with me?
-Listen to me, darling.

188
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:14,544
He's not just a hero. He's a national hero.

189
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:17,985
''Every TV network, every news service
has picked up the story.''

190
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:19,989
Terrific. What does it have to do with me?

191
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:21,547
-Don't you see?
-No, l don't.

192
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,922
-You're his hero.
-Why?

193
00:13:22,993 --> 00:13:24,483
-You're a hero's hero.
-Why?

194
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:26,792
This is big. Watch.

195
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:29,025
We're getting reports about a fire.

196
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,727
Yes, unfortunately ,
in a tragic twist of fate...

197
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:35,203
Jefferson Jones' cabin, his home,
burned to the ground...

198
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,900
while he was risking his life
to save the child .

199
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:40,466
That's right, George,
and according to firefighters...

200
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:42,876
-one of the possessions he has left...
-My cookbook?

201
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,971
...is this.

202
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:49,580
This is big!

203
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:54,085
What, just because one of my cookbooks
survived a fire?

204
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:55,591
Alex, you need medicine.

205
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:58,651
Because l've sold you
as a prime-time special.

206
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:00,325
You what?

207
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:04,128
l convinced Paul Prescott,
the head of the network, in a church...

208
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:08,228
that he ought to give you
a prime-time Christmas special.

209
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:11,171
-Are you serious?
-l'm serious.

210
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:12,709
What kind of a special?

211
00:14:12,776 --> 00:14:16,872
Hero. Saves kid. Loses house.
Has nothing...

212
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:20,809
except his fantasies about your cooking.

213
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:24,286
Your plum pudding, your candied yam...

214
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:27,290
your world-famous Christmas goose.

215
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:31,752
Jefferson Jones, come on down.
lt's kismet!

216
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,696
Are you serious? l'm doing my own....
l'm going prime-time?

217
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:36,995
Not only prime-time, but live.

218
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,534
-l'm going live?
-Live!

219
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:40,570
Oh, my God, it's an event.

220
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:42,663
Christmas in Connecticut!

221
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,842
Wait till all America sees you
and all the other Blanes...

222
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:51,608
sitting down to a Christmas dinner
with Jones himself.

223
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,550
-Alex, are you crazy?
-Cover of TV Guide, easy.

224
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:58,144
Alex, there are no other Blanes.
Listen to me.

225
00:14:58,222 --> 00:15:01,214
There is no house in Connecticut.
What are you talking about?

226
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:03,453
-Just details.
-Details? What--

227
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,119
Liz-ball, details.

228
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,561
Leave the details to me. l'll take care of it.

229
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:10,065
l need an espresso. l need a buzz!

230
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,168
l need a gun.

231
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:14,664
l've got it all figured out.

232
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:18,365
My sister's kids
are gonna be your grandkids.

233
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:22,503
That's Kevin and Melissa. And Josie, okay?

234
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:25,912
Josie's gonna be your daughter, Mary,
because she knows how to cook.

235
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:30,852
And l shall play your loving,
debonair husband.... What's his name?

236
00:15:32,122 --> 00:15:35,922
-What choice do you have?
-l'd sooner stick hot needles in my eyes.

237
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:39,422
-l need something to eat.
-l am not gonna do it, Alex.

238
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:42,294
You just give me one good reason
why l should. Tell me.

239
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:45,824
Because the show means promotion.
Promotion means ratings.

240
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,667
And ratings mean money.

241
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:52,301
Money?

242
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,074
Why can't it be me and Jones?

243
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:57,705
Because we've sold the public
on you and the family.

244
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:59,339
Now you've got to deliver.

245
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,180
You promised me this would
never happen. You promised me!

246
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,278
-You and l both know l can't cook.
-Don't say that so loud.

247
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:09,690
-l can't cook, Alex. l can't cook!
-What are you moaning about?

248
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:12,193
l saved you.

249
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,959
What were you before l rescued you
from that dead-end magazine?

250
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:18,228
-Happy, l was happy.
-A no-nothing writer.

251
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:21,863
-That's what l was. l was happy.
-Oh, poor baby. And now you're famous.

252
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,964
That's right. And in debt.

253
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:28,340
Everybody needs fairy tales.
People need cooking, home, devotion.

254
00:16:28,412 --> 00:16:31,472
-So Cinderella becomes a pumpkin.
-This pumpkin says no.

255
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:34,449
Well, if you won't do it for us,
do it for Josie.

256
00:16:34,518 --> 00:16:37,112
Think of the little people on the set.
They need it.

257
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:40,748
-What about Tanya, the cue card girl?
-Her name is Theresa.

258
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:45,027
l won't do it. No way!
lt's out of the question.

259
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:48,160
l know it's a lot to ask, Tyler.
l do know that.

260
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:49,893
lt'll only be for a couple of days.

261
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,491
-lmpossible.
-Why?

262
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:53,729
Look, do you think l like doing this?

263
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,205
Do you think l live to hand out menus
for Chocki's Chicken Chuckwagon?

264
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:59,606
-You look very cute.
-Oh, really?

265
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:02,871
When was the last time
you had to wear a feather suit to work?

266
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:06,473
l'm an actor. l have an audition
on the 27th, and l need to prepare.

267
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,610
-And l need to cook for Elizabeth.
-Wait a minute.

268
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:12,746
l got a great idea.
Why not look at it this way?

269
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,224
l mean, you could prepare
as my son-in-law out in Connecticut.

270
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:19,956
This might be the opportunity
that you've been thinking of.

271
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,193
Think of all the people
that will be seeing you on this special.

272
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,861
-Directors, agents--
-The operative word is your special.

273
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:27,369
No one's gonna notice me.

274
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:30,930
l'll just be an insignificant speck
in the constellation of your stardom.

275
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,909
-Why must you always do this, Tyler?
-Look, l need a break!

276
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:36,275
-He needs a break.
-l need to be noticed.

277
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,076
And not as Elizabeth Blane's son,
but as an artist.

278
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:41,743
Why don't you tell her
what you're auditioning for?

279
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,050
-What are you auditioning for?
-For a serial killer on Days of Love.

280
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:46,384
-lsn't that nice?
-Real art.

281
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:48,618
Sure, it's a good time to joke about it now.

282
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,627
What about two years from now?
What if this turns into a lead?

283
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,859
Then we'll be talking a totally different
story. l'm not gonna blow this audition.

284
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:59,300
lf you don't do this, l could be out of a job,
we'd be on the streets.

285
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,894
-So adjust.
-You can adjust, Tyler.

286
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,968
Adjustment is nice.

287
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,375
You never cease to amaze me, Jefferson.

288
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,239
Even burned my pipe.

289
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:15,808
You? On some cooking show.

290
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:18,382
l don't believe it.

291
00:18:19,857 --> 00:18:23,293
Elizabeth Blane is not only
America's favorite cook...

292
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:27,558
she's America's favorite mom.
Got a husband, kid...

293
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:31,492
grandkid, people. Lots of people, get it?

294
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:33,727
You hate people.

295
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:35,536
So why do it?

296
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,506
l got 25,000 reasons:

297
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:40,876
one for every dollar
the network's paying me.

298
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:45,875
You're not going Hollywood on me,
are you?

299
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:48,509
Listen, these people want to think...

300
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,453
l sit around dreaming about
this Blane woman's Christmas goose...

301
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,417
whatever that is.

302
00:18:55,158 --> 00:18:57,353
lf it gets me the money
to put this back up...

303
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,657
l can put up with her stuff
for a couple of days.

304
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,198
Elizabeth Blane
hunts her own Christmas goose.

305
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,733
She's famous for it.

306
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,961
You're such a big fan, you better brush up.

307
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:07,230
l will.

308
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:10,971
-When are you leaving?
-Soon as l'm packed.

309
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:20,714
l'm packed.

310
00:19:58,188 --> 00:20:00,088
God! What are you doing?

311
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,751
l'm getting in the part
of your loving husband.

312
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,919
Who's your role model, Hugh Hefner?
Look at you.

313
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,986
Let me show you the rest of the house.

314
00:20:07,297 --> 00:20:11,097
-This is the entry hall going through this--
-lt's beautiful.

315
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:17,196
-What was that, dear?
-That was my nephew, Andrew.

316
00:20:17,274 --> 00:20:18,502
Anthony!

317
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:20,399
My name's Anthony.

318
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:22,809
Your name is Kevin,
and he's your grandson.

319
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:24,210
-He doesn't look seven.
-l'm 10.

320
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:25,475
lt's close enough.

321
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:27,073
-Where's the TV?
-l don't know.

322
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,482
-What good are you?
-l don't know.

323
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:30,986
Mrs. B?

324
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:34,581
Norah, l'm so glad to see you.
l know you....

325
00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:37,718
-Who's this? l don't know this.
-This is my sister's other kid.

326
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:41,286
Your grandchild, Melissa.
lsn't she adorable?

327
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,162
She's got your eyes and my--

328
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,661
What is going on?

329
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:50,106
Why is everybody.... What?

330
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:54,276
l'll get her bottle.

331
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,705
Hello.

332
00:20:58,515 --> 00:21:02,042
l know exactly how you feel, dear.
lt's okay.

333
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,382
Right.

334
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:11,288
-l don't think she's very happy here.
-Oh, no.

335
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:14,354
-What is it?
-Drool.

336
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:15,657
-Drool?
-Here.

337
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,224
What is it doing? Wait a.... Norah. Hello!

338
00:21:25,008 --> 00:21:27,909
Kevin, come and meet
your mother and father.

339
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,840
-Anthony!
-What?

340
00:21:33,316 --> 00:21:36,752
Now listen to me. Your name is Kevin.
When l say Kevin, you come, okay?

341
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,220
-You can call me--
-Grandmother? Granny? Gramps?

342
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:41,314
You call me that, l'll put you in my soup.

343
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,225
Tyler, l'm so glad to see you.
Kevin, this is your father.

344
00:21:47,297 --> 00:21:50,323
Ever wondered what it would feel like
to sew your eyes closed?

345
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,799
-Charming.
-Cool.

346
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:54,564
He's in character. He refuses to give up
the soap audition.

347
00:21:54,638 --> 00:21:56,469
What about the character
of my son-in-law?

348
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,405
-l'm here, aren't l?
-Thank you very much.

349
00:21:58,475 --> 00:21:59,874
-We fought all the way.
-How come?

350
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,935
l'll tell you later.
Hon, where are you going?

351
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:05,571
-l'll be back.
-l love that guy.

352
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:08,277
This is your mother.
Kevin, l'm talking to you!

353
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:11,047
-ls he all right?
-He's just a little strange, that's all.

354
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,316
-The kitchen's there.
-Don't touch that!

355
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,950
-This is your daughter.
-Don't touch that.

356
00:22:16,026 --> 00:22:17,687
Oh, she is so cute.

357
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:22,823
-What's the matter?
-Put it down!

358
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,959
No! What are you....

359
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,803
What happened? Not....

360
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,809
-l told you to be careful, didn't l?
-Don't yell!

361
00:22:34,878 --> 00:22:38,609
Do you have any idea how much money
l had to put up as a security deposit?

362
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:39,774
Hello?

363
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,750
-You idiot!
-l hate you!

364
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:47,122
Will somebody stop the ringing, please?

365
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:50,792
What? Who's ringing? Hello?

366
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:53,352
-Everybody out!
-lt's the fax phone.

367
00:22:54,598 --> 00:22:56,793
Norah, l want to be alone now.

368
00:23:33,603 --> 00:23:34,968
Mrs. Blane?

369
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:40,599
-Are you okay?
-l'm fine.

370
00:23:41,745 --> 00:23:43,144
Who are you?

371
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:48,274
-You're Jefferson Jones.
-Afraid so, ma'am.

372
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:50,386
-What are you doing here?
-Excuse me?

373
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:52,114
What are you doing here today?

374
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:55,090
You're not supposed to be here
until the 25th.

375
00:23:55,158 --> 00:23:57,126
-Not according to this fax.
-What fax?

376
00:23:57,194 --> 00:23:58,491
This one.

377
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:05,364
''Please come early and get to know
my family. Signed, Elizabeth Blane.''

378
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,761
-Stop this!
-You won't listen to my needs, forget it.

379
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:10,170
What about what l want?

380
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,832
-You're so destructive!
-Not my fault!

381
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,637
You're breaking everything.

382
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,678
Where is the diaper bag?

383
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,086
Mr. Jones, l'd like to introduce my family.

384
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:30,649
Family, this is Jefferson Jones.

385
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,594
-Jonesy. l see you got my fax.
-Your fax?

386
00:24:35,198 --> 00:24:37,860
l cut a deal with People magazine.

387
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,459
They're gonna write a story
on how America's hostess...

388
00:24:40,537 --> 00:24:43,028
spends three days with America's hero.

389
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,903
lsn't that nice?

390
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,206
Maybe you could just show me
where my room is.

391
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,542
Nonsense. l want you to meet the family.

392
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,345
By the way, l'm Mr. Elizabeth Blane,
but you can call me....

393
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:57,352
-John Blane.
-John. l'm mighty proud of it.

394
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,752
Mr. Jones, let me introduce you
to my family.

395
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:03,691
l'd like you to meet my daughter, Mary,
and her husband, Evan.

396
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:07,496
l love the smell of human hair
when it burns.

397
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,362
l've been traveling all night.
Maybe l could go wash up?

398
00:25:12,435 --> 00:25:14,528
Can l have my allowance now?

399
00:25:14,604 --> 00:25:18,267
-l beg your pardon, dear?
-My special $10 allowance, Granny.

400
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,103
Ask your grandfather. Get it from him.

401
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:25,939
And this little pudge-face
is my granddaughter, Melissa.

402
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,107
She's so cute.

403
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:30,848
She's got your eyes.

404
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,524
lt's hard to believe, looking at you,
that you got two grandchildren.

405
00:25:36,593 --> 00:25:39,585
l find it really hard to believe it
myself sometimes.

406
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,221
We are vampires.

407
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:44,590
We suck the blood of innocents
and stay forever young.

408
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,603
Sweet. Mary, why don't you and Evan
take the children upstairs?

409
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,865
l'll hold it for you.

410
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:50,964
Will you show Mr. Jones
to his room, please?

411
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,508
-Sure.
-That'd be good.

412
00:25:52,575 --> 00:25:56,170
-Sure. Which one?
-Norah hasn't been with us for very long.

413
00:25:56,246 --> 00:25:58,180
lt's the first one on the left. Thank you.

414
00:25:58,248 --> 00:26:00,375
When should l start dinner?

415
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:09,058
-Are you the cook?
-Of course l'm the cook.

416
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,156
But that's my occupation.

417
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:12,922
So since l'm on vacation...

418
00:26:12,996 --> 00:26:15,464
Mary's gonna take over in the kitchen
until Christmas.

419
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,092
Thanks, Mary. Any time you want now.

420
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,273
You have an interesting family.

421
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:27,833
Yes, aren't they? Very interesting.

422
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:10,542
That's very manly of you.

423
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,654
-You were running low.
-Thank you.

424
00:27:17,894 --> 00:27:20,260
l suppose you just love being outside.

425
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,857
l mean, coming from
that mountainly place you come from.

426
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,594
Colorado.

427
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,165
Smell that?

428
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,006
Oh, yes, that's my Chanel No. 5.

429
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:46,420
lt's cedar.

430
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,784
Of course. Cedar.

431
00:27:53,396 --> 00:27:56,126
l bet you can't buy that at Bloomingdale's.

432
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,666
You're right.

433
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,308
How long did you live alone up in that...

434
00:28:08,845 --> 00:28:10,244
cabin place?

435
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:12,381
-Eleven years.
-Eleven years?

436
00:28:13,716 --> 00:28:15,843
Alone, alone? l mean, no....

437
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,946
-Women?
-Pets.

438
00:28:18,221 --> 00:28:19,449
Neither.

439
00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:22,016
That's a long time.

440
00:28:23,026 --> 00:28:25,517
-l thought about it a lot.
-Women?

441
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:26,687
Pets.

442
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,000
Excuse me.

443
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:42,608
Hi, Mary.

444
00:28:44,147 --> 00:28:45,944
l can't do this.

445
00:28:46,116 --> 00:28:49,916
Why? What's the matter?
Hi, sweetie. What's the matter, Mary?

446
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,719
-Mary's under a lot of stress.
-Maybe we should finish up for her.

447
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:57,851
-Finish up what?
-Her bath.

448
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:00,756
You ought to be an expert at this.

449
00:29:00,897 --> 00:29:05,459
No big deal. There's water, there's soap,
there's a rubber duck. lt's pretty routine.

450
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,096
You know what?
l just had the most wonderful idea.

451
00:29:10,173 --> 00:29:12,641
-How would you like to bathe her?
-Me?

452
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,678
Sure, l think it would be fun for you. Here.

453
00:29:15,745 --> 00:29:18,009
Let go of my hair, sweetheart.

454
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:21,579
You want to get in the bath?

455
00:29:21,651 --> 00:29:24,051
You two just have fun.
l'll see you in a while.

456
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,214
Where are you going?
You're gonna supervise for me?

457
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:30,853
-Hi, sweetie.
-ls it too hot?

458
00:29:31,694 --> 00:29:32,854
lt is too hot.

459
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:35,193
-Hi, honey.
-l don't blame you.

460
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,927
-Don't get water in her eyes.
-No, l'm not. l'm okay.

461
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:41,402
-She got any soap?
-Of course, soap.

462
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:44,269
Want some soap?
Here's some soap, sweetie.

463
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,236
-ls it just a little hot?
-Here's a duck.

464
00:29:48,978 --> 00:29:51,674
What about her hair? Should we wash it?

465
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:54,372
Well, l'll rinse and you put shampoo.

466
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,111
All right. Okay.

467
00:29:56,186 --> 00:29:58,780
-That's too much.
-What do you mean, it's too much?

468
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:02,382
l'm telling you. Watch her eyes, l told you.

469
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:04,987
Wait a minute. My fault.

470
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:07,757
Sorry, you're right. You're the expert.

471
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:10,291
Oh, you sweet thing. Sorry.

472
00:30:14,337 --> 00:30:16,464
l don't know if we got all the soap out.

473
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:18,530
-We did.
-She likes that.

474
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,667
You're awfully good with that
for a bachelor.

475
00:30:20,743 --> 00:30:24,110
You sure you don't have
a whole slew of kids hidden somewhere?

476
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,978
l nursed a couple of bear cubs
till their mother came back.

477
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,917
-This is better than bear cubs.
-Ain't she a beauty?

478
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:35,950
Josie, there you are.
Don't you ever do that to me again.

479
00:30:36,025 --> 00:30:38,823
You hand me this small, little,
slippery, wet baby.

480
00:30:38,895 --> 00:30:42,058
l don't know how to handle a baby.
l've never....

481
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,934
What's the matter, babe?

482
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,738
-Do you want to talk about it?
-No.

483
00:30:51,774 --> 00:30:52,866
Okay.

484
00:30:56,446 --> 00:30:58,141
Tyler's leaving me.

485
00:30:59,515 --> 00:31:00,982
Tyler's what?

486
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,480
l want to have a baby, Liz. He doesn't.

487
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:07,853
Josie, the two of you can work it out,
can't you?

488
00:31:07,924 --> 00:31:11,155
You've seen the way Tyler behaves.
Like Charles Manson.

489
00:31:11,227 --> 00:31:13,525
Do you know what it's like living like that?

490
00:31:13,596 --> 00:31:15,791
When he was up for Felix
in The Odd Couple ...

491
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:19,062
we had our biggest fight
over a coffee ring on the table.

492
00:31:19,135 --> 00:31:21,433
When he was up for
the stage manager in Our Town...

493
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:25,235
we had to experience small-town life
by moving in with his parents...

494
00:31:25,308 --> 00:31:26,900
in Dayton, Ohio!

495
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,207
With every new part,
comes a completely different personality.

496
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,680
He's so obsessed with his career.

497
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,311
How are we ever going to have
a life together?

498
00:31:39,922 --> 00:31:41,856
Why don't you just be honest?

499
00:31:41,924 --> 00:31:43,915
lt won't change anything.

500
00:31:44,227 --> 00:31:45,956
You know something?

501
00:31:49,098 --> 00:31:50,395
lt might.

502
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:54,459
lt just might.

503
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,743
Hey, Jonesy baby, wait a minute.

504
00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:06,177
Mind if l come along with you?

505
00:32:09,652 --> 00:32:12,382
You don't mind me tagging along, do you?

506
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:14,615
-Come on.
-Nice and nippy. Thanks.

507
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,954
l did want to have a little talk with you...

508
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:20,052
since l'm the producer
and l'm giving you $25,000 for the show...

509
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:21,653
l thought l'd tell you what's what.

510
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,098
You're gonna see a part of showbiz
that very few people see.

511
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:27,728
-You know, show business magic.
-Right.

512
00:32:27,804 --> 00:32:30,830
So l just wanted to bring you up to date
with everything.

513
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,774
There may be a time,
there's just the possibility...

514
00:32:33,843 --> 00:32:36,744
l'm not sure that it's gonna happen,
but it's a possibility...

515
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:40,305
that somewhere along the line....
lt's really chilly.

516
00:32:40,383 --> 00:32:45,320
...that somewhere along the line
you're not gonna see Elizabeth cook.

517
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,622
You got any questions?

518
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:51,959
How long have you two been married?

519
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:54,655
Well, time is relative,
and relative is relative.

520
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:58,132
But it's been worth every minute of it.
You know what l mean by ''worth.''

521
00:32:58,201 --> 00:32:59,691
She's like a cabernet of love.

522
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,364
She gets richer, fuller,
more intoxicating with age, you know.

523
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,907
You know what l think it is?
l think it's chemical.

524
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:07,408
Every time l get a whiff of her...

525
00:33:07,477 --> 00:33:09,570
l wanna take her in my arms
and give her a kiss.

526
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:12,739
You know what drives her crazy?
When l suck her toes.

527
00:33:12,815 --> 00:33:15,010
She goes crazy, like a horse.

528
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:20,520
But look who l'm talking to.
A good-looking guy like you.

529
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:23,354
You're out there getting all that action.

530
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:26,589
-Nobody ever neighed for me.
-That takes a little special finesse.

531
00:33:26,662 --> 00:33:29,187
l could teach you how to do it, if you want.

532
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:33,133
Can l ask you a question, please?
lt's 40 degrees below zero out here.

533
00:33:33,202 --> 00:33:36,603
-What are we doing here?
-l was taking a walk.

534
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,232
Enjoy yourself.

535
00:33:43,613 --> 00:33:47,572
Without the cover, you got no story.
l told you that. You're late.

536
00:33:48,184 --> 00:33:50,084
You snooze, you lose.

537
00:33:57,894 --> 00:34:01,853
Tell me something: Do you dream in color?
Or in black and white?

538
00:34:05,635 --> 00:34:08,331
Would you please pass me that end piece?

539
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,495
Can l have some potatoes?

540
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:16,642
-ls your food all right?
-Yeah, l just fill up quick these days.

541
00:34:16,712 --> 00:34:18,646
Of course, after what you've been through.

542
00:34:18,714 --> 00:34:22,514
Hey, mister, if they didn't find you,
would you have eaten that kid?

543
00:34:24,287 --> 00:34:26,346
-l don't think so.
-Pass the potatoes.

544
00:34:26,422 --> 00:34:28,356
Would you have eaten your own foot?

545
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:29,652
-Kevin!
-Maybe.

546
00:34:29,725 --> 00:34:32,751
-Would you like some peas?
-How do you like this chow?

547
00:34:33,262 --> 00:34:37,096
l bet you didn't run across
any Chateaubriand in the forest, did you?

548
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,997
No, this is real good.

549
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:41,093
l guess l'm just more...

550
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:44,936
a 4:00 a.m. black-coffee-bacon-
and-flapjacks kind of person.

551
00:34:45,007 --> 00:34:47,339
Flapjack? What a coincidence.

552
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,379
Elizabeth wrote a whole book
about flapjacks.

553
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,614
-You want flapjacks?
-Mary will cook them in the morning.

554
00:34:53,683 --> 00:34:55,981
-The potatoes?
-l love flapjacks.

555
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,384
-Pass the potatoes!
-Here!

556
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:03,853
Shut up!

557
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,520
Do you have to talk to him that way?
He's only a kid.

558
00:35:06,596 --> 00:35:09,463
-You're the big expert on kids, right?
-At least l want them !

559
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:10,658
Fine.

560
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,563
Dessert, anyone?

561
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,401
l noticed you don't have a Christmas tree.

562
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,172
-There's a good reason for that.
-Very good reason for that.

563
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,650
We have to wait until Christmas.

564
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,351
-We wait until Christmas.
-Why?

565
00:35:33,456 --> 00:35:34,514
Why?

566
00:35:35,558 --> 00:35:38,994
-For the show.
-Of course, our show. Absolutely.

567
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,420
See, the set decorator comes in
and he does the whole house.

568
00:35:42,498 --> 00:35:44,261
Oh, the whole house.

569
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,198
-Every nook and cranny.
-Yes.

570
00:35:46,802 --> 00:35:49,168
-Normally--
-We have a huge Christmas tree.

571
00:35:49,238 --> 00:35:51,763
-Really big.
-Yes, a veritable redwood, you know?

572
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:54,571
-But this year, we have prime-time.
-Yes.

573
00:35:58,047 --> 00:36:00,277
Mr. Jones, you're such a fascinating man.

574
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:02,977
l was just wondering,
have you always been a park ranger?

575
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:07,546
Actually, before l moved to Colorado,
l lived in Chicago. l grew up there.

576
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,950
Taught Comparative Literature
at the University for 10 years.

577
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:13,461
Really? Wow!

578
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:15,554
Then l quit and moved west.

579
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,099
Why? l mean,
why would you give up teaching?

580
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:20,829
l got offered tenure
and Head of the Department...

581
00:36:20,903 --> 00:36:22,962
and it's what l thought l wanted.

582
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:25,530
But it meant being caged in...

583
00:36:25,608 --> 00:36:28,270
by concrete and crowds
for the rest of my life.

584
00:36:28,344 --> 00:36:32,678
One day l went to work, and it was
like going into a long, dark tunnel.

585
00:36:33,082 --> 00:36:36,347
l knew l was never going to see
the other end. l couldn't do it.

586
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:40,082
People were telling me what to do.
l had to be outdoors.

587
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,387
You know what l'm talking about,
living out here.

588
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,725
Excuse me.

589
00:36:46,228 --> 00:36:49,527
l admire you for giving up the city,
you know...

590
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,033
to raise a family in the country.

591
00:36:56,272 --> 00:36:59,070
-You figured it out before l did.
-We try.

592
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:02,275
Well, it's been a long day.

593
00:37:02,645 --> 00:37:04,670
l think l'm gonna turn in.

594
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,507
-Elizabeth?
-What?

595
00:37:06,749 --> 00:37:09,149
-Time to go to bed.
-Together?

596
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,187
l mean, it's only 9:30, dear.

597
00:37:12,254 --> 00:37:14,245
But you know what they say
in the country.

598
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:17,053
-What do they say?
-Early to bed, early to rise.

599
00:37:17,126 --> 00:37:21,085
That's if you've got cows and things.
This is Connecticut, and we've got guests.

600
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:24,564
-You go to bed.
-But you know l can't sleep without you.

601
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:26,158
We're like two spoons.

602
00:37:26,235 --> 00:37:29,602
For God's sakes, John,
what are you talking about?

603
00:37:29,672 --> 00:37:31,435
-Well, l mean--
-We have company.

604
00:37:31,507 --> 00:37:34,476
Please, Jonesy's a grown man.
You and l are adults--

605
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,340
-You're a grown man, too.
-Yes, but still.

606
00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:38,312
-Go to bed alone.
-l don't wanna go alone.

607
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,849
-Dear, l want you to.
-You all go on.

608
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:42,941
-No! We don't have to go.
-Mom !

609
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:44,111
Yes?

610
00:37:44,186 --> 00:37:46,518
-Can you come up here?
-Yes, of course l will.

611
00:37:46,589 --> 00:37:49,319
No, she can't.
Mom and Dad are going to bed.

612
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,586
What is it, darling?

613
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,754
Kevin wants Grandma
to read him a bedtime story.

614
00:37:54,764 --> 00:37:57,733
Kevin wants Grandma
to read him a bedtime story.

615
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,792
l couldn't disappoint Kevin.
Excuse me please, Mr. Jones.

616
00:38:06,676 --> 00:38:08,439
She's such a mother.

617
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,640
Kevin, you want to make $20 cash
right now?

618
00:38:13,716 --> 00:38:17,015
Get in bed, pretend like
l'm reading to you. Hustle.

619
00:38:24,794 --> 00:38:28,252
''lt was his destiny to slay the dragon...

620
00:38:28,798 --> 00:38:30,663
''and save the kingdom.

621
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,336
''The great big kingdom was there.''
Absolutely there.

622
00:38:40,843 --> 00:38:43,209
Hey, where's my $20?

623
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,847
For $50, l can fake a nightmare
and sleep in your bed.

624
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:51,318
Thanks, Kevo. l'll keep that in mind.
l'll remember that.

625
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,655
Thought you were going to bed?

626
00:39:00,996 --> 00:39:04,864
l was. Just, you know, doing my exercises.

627
00:39:04,934 --> 00:39:07,767
Very important to stay in shape,
you know.

628
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,273
-Good night!
-Good night.

629
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:19,378
Forgot the toothpaste.

630
00:39:43,105 --> 00:39:46,802
Norah, you scared me half to death.

631
00:39:46,876 --> 00:39:49,868
-What are you doing down here?
-l was fixing myself a snack.

632
00:39:49,945 --> 00:39:51,845
l heard a woman scream.

633
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,680
We didn't hear anything, did we?

634
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:58,181
-l thought you were going to bed.
-So did l.

635
00:39:58,254 --> 00:39:59,551
So did l.

636
00:40:00,723 --> 00:40:02,088
Good night.

637
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,819
-Mrs. Blane?
-Yes?

638
00:40:05,094 --> 00:40:08,291
-Are you going for the goose tomorrow?
-The goose?

639
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,991
The Christmas goose.

640
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:12,397
The one we hunt
every Christmas Eve morning...

641
00:40:12,468 --> 00:40:14,595
after having slept all night together.

642
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,399
That goose. l knew what goose.

643
00:40:16,472 --> 00:40:19,134
l thought this year, with the show,
we wouldn't do that.

644
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,540
l'd love to come along with you.

645
00:40:21,977 --> 00:40:24,878
-l saw a whole flock of geese this morning.
-You can't.

646
00:40:24,947 --> 00:40:27,780
l'm sorry, but we only have two guns,
or two rifles.

647
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,341
-Right?
-l don't know. Don't start me to lying.

648
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:32,910
-lsn't that right, John?
-l could check around.

649
00:40:32,988 --> 00:40:35,479
No, we couldn't possibly.
lt's a family tradition.

650
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,459
Every year, just John and me.

651
00:40:39,128 --> 00:40:41,028
He could take my place.

652
00:40:41,597 --> 00:40:44,464
-Sure?
-Are you kidding? You're my guest.

653
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:48,060
-What time do we start?
-Early.

654
00:40:49,305 --> 00:40:51,398
Very, very early.

655
00:40:51,473 --> 00:40:54,169
l don't wanna wake you up.
l'd better sleep in the den.

656
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,838
-No, l don't think that's necessary.
-lt is necessary, my sweetest.

657
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,380
-No.
-My darling.

658
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:00,847
Good night.

659
00:41:09,058 --> 00:41:10,252
Oh, no.

660
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:36,980
-Good morning. Ready for the hunt?
-The hunt.

661
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:40,354
-Coffee?
-No, thank you. l don't want any coffee.

662
00:41:40,422 --> 00:41:43,687
-Did you sleep well last night?
-l slept okay. What is that?

663
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:45,249
-What?
-That?

664
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:47,192
-That's the sun.
-No.

665
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:48,992
That's the sun? lt's all pink and blue.

666
00:41:49,064 --> 00:41:51,089
-You got any sugar?
-Sure.

667
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:56,262
Sugar, someplace.

668
00:41:57,373 --> 00:42:00,604
-Sugar.
-Forget it. We ought to get going.

669
00:42:00,676 --> 00:42:02,837
-l have an orange. You want one?
-Let's go.

670
00:42:02,912 --> 00:42:04,641
-Two oranges?
-Yeah.

671
00:42:11,787 --> 00:42:14,779
Do you always wear all those clothes
when you go hunting?

672
00:42:14,857 --> 00:42:16,085
Always.

673
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:19,521
-Do you ever get hot?
-Are you kidding me? Never.

674
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,819
-You're staring at me.
-Sorry.

675
00:43:28,197 --> 00:43:30,893
lt's my hair, isn't it? lt's all poofy.

676
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:33,662
No, you look fine.

677
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,393
l was just wondering how you do it.

678
00:43:37,506 --> 00:43:40,907
-Do what?
-Live out here.

679
00:43:41,677 --> 00:43:44,475
Take care of a family. Maintain a career.

680
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,907
Look like you do.

681
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:52,645
-lt's gotta be the clean living.
-Or the facials l get every week.

682
00:43:53,322 --> 00:43:57,258
l know this might be hard for you
to accept, l actually like New York City.

683
00:43:57,326 --> 00:43:58,588
And the crime?

684
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,059
-Theaters.
-Pollution.

685
00:44:00,129 --> 00:44:02,154
-Museums.
-Sex, drugs--

686
00:44:02,231 --> 00:44:04,859
Rock 'n' roll. l love the whole scene.

687
00:44:06,035 --> 00:44:08,970
Wouldn't seem so great
if you couldn't escape to Connecticut.

688
00:44:09,038 --> 00:44:10,528
Yeah, well.

689
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,171
Hey, wait for me.
Would you carry my gun?

690
00:44:16,178 --> 00:44:17,167
And me?

691
00:44:21,483 --> 00:44:23,917
This is great. l really love this.

692
00:44:24,486 --> 00:44:26,420
Can we turn around now?

693
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:30,356
You got everything, a beautiful home...

694
00:44:30,426 --> 00:44:33,520
successful career, terrific family.

695
00:44:33,595 --> 00:44:36,029
What more could you possibly want?

696
00:44:36,398 --> 00:44:39,094
Maybe to be appreciated
for more than my beautiful home...

697
00:44:39,168 --> 00:44:42,137
successful career, and incredible family.

698
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:44,566
l know.

699
00:44:46,775 --> 00:44:47,969
You do?

700
00:44:49,278 --> 00:44:53,044
Yeah, you have grace, intelligence,
and a sense of humor.

701
00:44:57,453 --> 00:44:59,478
lt's a killer combination.

702
00:45:00,055 --> 00:45:04,890
Why, Jefferson Jones,
l actually think you're flirting with me.

703
00:45:10,232 --> 00:45:11,722
This is crazy.

704
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,974
Listen.

705
00:45:29,051 --> 00:45:31,849
lt's a family. Aren't they sweet?

706
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,420
What are you doing? You're not gonna....

707
00:45:43,465 --> 00:45:45,160
You didn't get it?

708
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,010
Good morning, family!

709
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,522
Forget it. Hey, l think they're coming.

710
00:46:10,659 --> 00:46:14,891
They're here! All right, everybody.
Let's make it look family time. Let's go.

711
00:46:14,963 --> 00:46:16,988
Elizabeth's here. Come on.

712
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:21,627
lf you won't do it for me,
do it for Elizabeth.

713
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:25,834
There you go. That's it. Perfect.

714
00:46:32,981 --> 00:46:37,577
''Captain Flash came screaming
from the sky from his rocket ship.''

715
00:46:37,653 --> 00:46:40,213
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

716
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:41,756
Get a grip, Gramps.

717
00:46:41,823 --> 00:46:44,257
Yeah, Gramp, get a grip. Hi, Gorgeous.

718
00:46:44,326 --> 00:46:46,726
-Where's dinner?
-Buy a turkey.

719
00:46:46,795 --> 00:46:49,662
l missed a goose by a mile.
Something distracted me.

720
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,299
lt sure did.

721
00:46:53,402 --> 00:46:56,633
You're just in time
to flip the flapjacks, dumpling.

722
00:46:56,705 --> 00:46:57,763
Flapjacks?

723
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,637
l'm not in a flipping mood this morning.
Let Norah do it.

724
00:47:00,709 --> 00:47:02,700
-l don't flip. l scoop.
-You do?

725
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,303
No, l want you
to flip me a flapjack, please.

726
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,712
-You haven't done one in such a long time.
-What?

727
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,547
For me. lf not for me,
do it for our honored guest, Jonesy.

728
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,712
-Don't you wanna see her flapjack?
-Absolutely.

729
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:16,280
-We'd love to see you flip a flapjack.
-You'd love to see me flip.

730
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:18,451
-Flip a flapjack. For you?
-Yes.

731
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,859
l'd be happy to, John. Happy to.

732
00:47:21,697 --> 00:47:23,631
-Oh, my God.
-This is gonna be good.

733
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:25,462
-Norah, make way.
-Come on, Jonesy.

734
00:47:25,534 --> 00:47:28,526
All right, gather round, everyone.
This is it.

735
00:47:28,737 --> 00:47:30,102
This is it.

736
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,387
-Yeah, all right!
-Do another one.

737
00:47:47,456 --> 00:47:50,254
No, sorry, folks, one is my limit.
Make way.

738
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,384
l'll see you in a while.

739
00:47:55,364 --> 00:47:56,592
Go away.

740
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,798
Oh, God. l know l'm gonna regret this.

741
00:48:05,474 --> 00:48:08,068
Okay, the door isn't locked. Come in.

742
00:48:11,913 --> 00:48:13,540
Liz, it's Tyler.

743
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:15,910
-He's gone.
-What?

744
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:19,278
l just checked the room.
He took all his things.

745
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,949
Come on, sweetie. lt's all right.

746
00:48:25,894 --> 00:48:28,328
Come on, we'll think of something.

747
00:49:00,362 --> 00:49:01,886
Attention, all passengers.

748
00:49:01,963 --> 00:49:05,694
The train from Eastport leaving
to Hartford, Bristol and New Haven...

749
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:07,701
has been delayed.

750
00:49:09,638 --> 00:49:13,199
Aren't you a little bit old
to be running away from home?

751
00:49:20,716 --> 00:49:23,446
Josie's really worried sick about you.

752
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:29,721
l know this is going to surprise you,
but l know what you're going through.

753
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:32,783
-l know just the way you feel.
-Good, then we needn't discuss it.

754
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:34,954
You want that career so badly,
you can taste it.

755
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,930
Nothing else can come in front of it.

756
00:49:36,998 --> 00:49:39,432
Let me ask you something:
lf you had to choose...

757
00:49:39,501 --> 00:49:42,527
if you had to give up Josie for your career,
would you do that?

758
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,698
No, of course not. l would never want that.

759
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,265
When you're starting out,
your career has to come first.

760
00:49:48,343 --> 00:49:51,835
Bull! lf you have someone to love
who loves you back...

761
00:49:51,913 --> 00:49:54,541
everything else is secondary.
l don't care what it is.

762
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,914
Your home, your job,
your career, everything.

763
00:49:56,985 --> 00:49:58,680
Easy to say from where you sit.

764
00:49:58,754 --> 00:50:01,985
Especially from where l sit, mister.
Listen to me.

765
00:50:02,057 --> 00:50:04,958
All those wonderful things
that go with a sensational career...

766
00:50:05,026 --> 00:50:06,994
all those things don't mean diddlysquat...

767
00:50:07,062 --> 00:50:10,429
if you don't have someone special
to share them with.

768
00:50:10,665 --> 00:50:13,395
Do you understand
what l'm saying to you?

769
00:50:14,102 --> 00:50:15,296
Do you?

770
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:24,741
Do you understand
what l'm saying to you?

771
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:29,243
Tyler is a loser, with a capital ''L.''
He is a loser.

772
00:50:29,584 --> 00:50:33,748
And here's a beautiful woman like you
crying over a ding-dong loser.

773
00:50:33,922 --> 00:50:38,154
l can't believe it. l hate losers.
You know why? 'Cause l'm a winner.

774
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:41,989
And you know what winners can do?
Winners know how to treat a woman.

775
00:50:42,297 --> 00:50:45,664
l know what a woman wants.
l know what a woman needs.

776
00:50:46,034 --> 00:50:48,059
l know what a woman feels.

777
00:50:50,272 --> 00:50:52,069
Take this Jefferson.

778
00:50:53,275 --> 00:50:55,869
You think he knows what a woman wants?
He's dumb.

779
00:50:55,944 --> 00:50:58,742
Lives in a log cabin,
dresses like Howdy Doody.

780
00:50:58,814 --> 00:51:00,145
What does he know about women?

781
00:51:00,215 --> 00:51:02,740
Do you think Elizabeth could go
for a guy like that?

782
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:05,753
Think about it a little bit. A log cabin?

783
00:51:05,821 --> 00:51:08,381
She lives in this beautiful penthouse
in New York City...

784
00:51:08,457 --> 00:51:10,084
goes to the theater, parties with me.

785
00:51:10,158 --> 00:51:14,219
l mean, you got to be out of your head
to even consider something like that.

786
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:19,760
What am l doing up here?

787
00:51:19,835 --> 00:51:21,462
Giving me advice.

788
00:51:22,471 --> 00:51:24,666
Oh, yeah, exactly. l got it.

789
00:51:25,974 --> 00:51:28,033
Go blonde and dump Tyler.

790
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,670
Come on, give me a little smile.

791
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,378
l've been looking for you.

792
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:44,684
Hi. l had to run some errands.

793
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,091
How you doing?

794
00:51:47,162 --> 00:51:50,529
Do you think John would mind
if l borrowed you for half an hour?

795
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:52,658
Well, l'm not the family mule.

796
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:55,294
You don't need his permission
to spend time with me.

797
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,635
-lf you want to ask someone, ask me.
-You mean yes?

798
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:14,950
l've been trying to think of a scene...

799
00:52:15,023 --> 00:52:17,651
where the husband and wife
kiss and make up.

800
00:52:17,726 --> 00:52:19,694
Maybe you can improvise.

801
00:52:21,563 --> 00:52:22,894
lmprovise?

802
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,526
Okay.

803
00:52:28,737 --> 00:52:30,364
Josie, l'm sorry.

804
00:52:35,877 --> 00:52:38,107
l don't want to fight anymore.

805
00:52:42,751 --> 00:52:45,652
l'm bored. Can we do something?

806
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:50,290
Kevin, l don't think this is a good time.

807
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:51,950
Okay, l'll wait.

808
00:53:01,102 --> 00:53:04,560
-So you want to show me trees?
-A Christmas tree.

809
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,574
-What do you mean?
-l saw it yesterday when l took a walk.

810
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:11,476
l found this beautiful little tree.
lt reminded me of you.

811
00:53:12,614 --> 00:53:15,082
l've been thinking about it ever since.

812
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,118
But we can't have our own tree.

813
00:53:17,185 --> 00:53:20,382
Listen, l know all about the show
and the set decorator.

814
00:53:20,455 --> 00:53:22,616
-You got to use your own decoration.
-Why?

815
00:53:22,691 --> 00:53:24,556
This is Christmas Eve.

816
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,225
You got to have a tree for the kids.

817
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,155
l think it's a great idea.

818
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,967
-What do you think?
-This tree?

819
00:53:36,371 --> 00:53:38,339
lt's a nice little tree.

820
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:41,565
Well, let's go.

821
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:23,014
Look at you. Sitting there so innocent...

822
00:54:24,452 --> 00:54:25,919
so beautiful.

823
00:54:27,856 --> 00:54:30,552
You tried to make me think it was okay...

824
00:54:32,027 --> 00:54:33,494
but it isn't!

825
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,587
You lied to me!

826
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,662
You lied!

827
00:54:41,436 --> 00:54:43,927
And now it's time to pay the price.

828
00:54:47,175 --> 00:54:50,303
Okay, this is when you say:

829
00:54:51,479 --> 00:54:55,711
''Roger, you're sick. You need help.
Killing me won't solve anything.''

830
00:55:00,188 --> 00:55:02,053
Who writes this stuff?

831
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:07,455
Certainly not you. You're too smart.

832
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:11,492
You'll probably go
your whole adorable little life...

833
00:55:11,566 --> 00:55:14,228
never even watching a soap opera.

834
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:17,229
You don't watch that stuff.

835
00:55:17,372 --> 00:55:19,863
Okay, back in character.

836
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:24,141
You got to help me here, darling.
l got to think psychopath.

837
00:55:30,652 --> 00:55:32,244
Now's my chance.

838
00:55:32,754 --> 00:55:34,244
Finally alone!

839
00:55:36,057 --> 00:55:40,551
l've had about enough of you
crying all hours of the night!

840
00:55:41,563 --> 00:55:44,896
l got news for you. l'm going to sell you.

841
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:49,828
That's right. We're broke,
so you're going to the highest bidder.

842
00:55:50,705 --> 00:55:54,766
A kid like you ought to keep us in gravy
for the rest of the year.

843
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:58,145
And then l'll have to kill the rest of them !

844
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,779
And l know just how l'll do it.

845
00:56:04,285 --> 00:56:06,219
But first things first.

846
00:56:09,224 --> 00:56:12,455
-Look, Josie.
-You look just like him.

847
00:56:13,294 --> 00:56:15,057
-Hey, they're back.
-Look.

848
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,757
What's that?

849
00:56:16,865 --> 00:56:19,891
What does it look like?
lt's our Christmas tree.

850
00:56:19,968 --> 00:56:23,597
Where's the wooden stand
the lot guy always makes you pay $5 for?

851
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:27,038
-lt didn't come from a lot.
-lt came from the forest.

852
00:56:27,809 --> 00:56:30,004
-Weird.
-l'll show you ''weird.''

853
00:56:47,796 --> 00:56:50,697
-Wipe your shoes off.
-Hey, tree time!

854
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,793
-Don't get it all over.
-Careful, Kevin.

855
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,894
Hi, Mommy. How was she?

856
00:56:56,971 --> 00:56:59,371
Right over there, in front of the window.

857
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,136
-Where are the decorations?
-Decorations?

858
00:57:03,511 --> 00:57:04,739
Wait a minute.

859
00:57:04,813 --> 00:57:06,781
You got some, don't you?

860
00:57:07,615 --> 00:57:10,448
No. Actually, we had a burglary last year.

861
00:57:10,518 --> 00:57:12,645
They stole all of the decorations.

862
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,553
What kind of a person
steals Christmas decorations?

863
00:57:15,623 --> 00:57:17,488
-A bad person.
-lt's very important.

864
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,925
Just give me a second. Wait. What is it?

865
00:57:19,994 --> 00:57:22,189
-You got any popcorn?
-Yes.

866
00:57:22,263 --> 00:57:24,629
-Cranberries?
-We've everything you could want.

867
00:57:24,699 --> 00:57:27,668
-Yes, and l got our lights put out front.
-We're in business.

868
00:57:30,705 --> 00:57:34,664
All right, that's it. Come on.
No, don't pull on my cranberries.

869
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,107
This is so frustrating
when you can't get these things undone.

870
00:57:39,714 --> 00:57:41,306
-What?
-Watch.

871
00:57:42,383 --> 00:57:45,580
Showoff. Look how easily he did that.

872
00:57:48,323 --> 00:57:52,054
-You guys, save some popcorn for me.
-Kevin, you guys finished down there?

873
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,855
We're all finished.

874
00:57:58,233 --> 00:57:59,894
l have a surprise.

875
00:58:00,635 --> 00:58:03,866
-Look, l made cookies.
-Norah, you're so sweet.

876
00:58:04,072 --> 00:58:06,165
-Look at these.
-Aren't they beautiful?

877
00:58:06,241 --> 00:58:10,177
-Can we make some skull heads?
-Skull heads? That's a good idea.

878
00:58:10,245 --> 00:58:13,442
We'll all make skull heads.
All right, come on, Dad.

879
00:58:13,514 --> 00:58:16,574
-l am not making skull heads.
-Yes, you are now.

880
00:58:18,086 --> 00:58:19,849
What's a skull head?

881
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,954
You got left with a cookie in your mouth.

882
00:58:23,024 --> 00:58:25,185
Look at that, they left us and stranded us.

883
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,922
l guess we're gonna
have to decorate the tree?

884
00:58:27,996 --> 00:58:29,588
-l don't like that there.
-l guess so.

885
00:58:29,664 --> 00:58:31,359
Let me see where this belongs.

886
00:58:31,432 --> 00:58:33,992
-No, wait a minute.
-Right there.

887
00:58:34,068 --> 00:58:35,626
-You can't do that.
-Why not?

888
00:58:35,703 --> 00:58:38,570
lt's too big.
The big ones go on the bottom.

889
00:58:38,873 --> 00:58:41,740
l don't like it there.
Why do they have to go on the bottom?

890
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:46,075
-Because the little ones go on top.
-l don't like rules. l hate rules.

891
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,307
lt's perfect.

892
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:55,045
You know, the top of the tree
looks really empty.

893
00:58:55,123 --> 00:58:59,219
l know just what to put up there.
l'll get it and come right back.

894
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:12,962
-Something's wrong with Tyler.
-Tyler's all right. He's a little confused--

895
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:14,941
There's something not right about him.

896
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:17,569
There's something not right
about a lot of things here.

897
00:59:17,645 --> 00:59:20,978
-He could be dangerous.
-Come on, Alex.

898
00:59:21,049 --> 00:59:23,916
He's about as dangerous
as that little baby, Melissa.

899
00:59:23,985 --> 00:59:26,510
But, listen, he could ruin the show.

900
00:59:26,587 --> 00:59:28,953
lt's not too late to recast him.

901
00:59:29,457 --> 00:59:32,949
Alex, you really worry too much.
You really do.

902
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,154
l mean, this is Christmas, munchkins.

903
00:59:35,229 --> 00:59:38,027
What in the world
could possibly go wrong?

904
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,199
-What is that?
-lt's so beautiful.

905
00:59:46,274 --> 00:59:50,040
l'm telling you, l think a skull head
would look much better.

906
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:52,809
-lt's perfect.
-Just like a pro.

907
00:59:56,084 --> 00:59:59,315
-l knew it would be just right.
-This is prettiful.

908
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,251
-lt's nice.
-Let's light it.

909
01:00:01,322 --> 01:00:03,483
-Let's go for it.
-Go ahead, go for it.

910
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,822
All right. Watch closely.

911
01:00:07,628 --> 01:00:08,925
All right!

912
01:00:11,299 --> 01:00:13,028
l can't believe it.

913
01:00:13,835 --> 01:00:15,234
We did that.

914
01:00:16,337 --> 01:00:19,568
-You act like you never had one before.
-l haven't!

915
01:00:19,707 --> 01:00:21,834
l mean, not this beautiful.

916
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:26,573
l think this is the most beautiful tree
in the world. Never seen anything....

917
01:00:26,647 --> 01:00:29,707
l was gonna wait until morning,
but l just can't now.

918
01:00:29,784 --> 01:00:32,878
l'll explain when l get back.
Just wait a minute, okay?

919
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,746
You're good at that, kid.

920
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,550
-Jefferson.
-Gifts.

921
01:00:41,362 --> 01:00:42,954
Merry Christmas.

922
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,899
-Sweetheart.
-l love gifts.

923
01:00:49,303 --> 01:00:51,100
This is so beautiful.

924
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,133
l think l know what it is.

925
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:00,670
Love Isn't Always Easy.

926
01:01:00,815 --> 01:01:02,976
This is exactly what we need.

927
01:01:03,051 --> 01:01:05,611
-lt's what you need.
-No, it's what you need.

928
01:01:06,054 --> 01:01:09,023
All right. This is just what l need.

929
01:01:20,034 --> 01:01:21,865
This is what we need.

930
01:01:23,571 --> 01:01:24,902
Thank you.

931
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:29,206
Look at me.

932
01:01:33,781 --> 01:01:35,248
Where's Alex?

933
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,045
Look what l got. l got a cone.

934
01:01:37,118 --> 01:01:40,144
l love these glasses. Thank you, Gramps.

935
01:01:42,924 --> 01:01:45,222
You know what?
We didn't get you anything.

936
01:01:45,293 --> 01:01:49,127
-l don't need anything. l've got you.
-Not so fast. l got something for you.

937
01:01:51,466 --> 01:01:54,958
-What is that?
-Since yours is up on the tree...

938
01:01:55,636 --> 01:01:57,627
l figured you might want that.

939
01:01:57,705 --> 01:02:00,003
-Look at me.
-How sweet.

940
01:02:00,074 --> 01:02:02,008
l love it. Thank you very much.

941
01:02:02,076 --> 01:02:03,907
Time to celebrate.

942
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,336
Champagne!

943
01:02:10,718 --> 01:02:12,015
There.

944
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,611
-Thank you. Here we go.
-Let me help.

945
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:19,521
You can hold it, but don't drink.
l want to make a toast before you drink.

946
01:02:19,594 --> 01:02:21,585
Just a little toast here.

947
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,853
To my family.

948
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,564
-Oh, no.
-Who turned out the lights?

949
01:02:29,637 --> 01:02:32,629
lt's dark. Tyler, let's go make a baby
right now.

950
01:02:32,807 --> 01:02:35,435
Who's touching me? Get your hands off.

951
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:40,542
'''Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house

952
01:02:40,915 --> 01:02:44,646
''Not a creature was stirring
not even a mouse

953
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,019
''The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care

954
01:02:49,123 --> 01:02:52,354
''ln hopes that St. Nicholas
soon would be there

955
01:02:53,261 --> 01:02:56,822
''The children were nestled
all snug in their beds

956
01:02:57,465 --> 01:03:00,662
''While visions of sugar-plums
danced in their heads''

957
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:05,001
Look what l have for everyone.
Your favorite chocolate coconut angels.

958
01:03:05,873 --> 01:03:07,738
Come on in. lt's open!

959
01:03:27,395 --> 01:03:30,660
lt's been an absolutely perfect Christmas.

960
01:03:30,731 --> 01:03:33,222
We're so happy that you could all join us...

961
01:03:33,301 --> 01:03:35,997
and special thanks to our guest,
Jefferson Jones.

962
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:37,731
God bless you all.

963
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:40,271
And cut! Perfect.

964
01:03:40,341 --> 01:03:41,933
Nice, very nice.

965
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:46,038
Next year, let's do Christmas in Florida.
lt's way too cold here.

966
01:03:47,415 --> 01:03:50,407
Okay, it was great.
You were all so wonderful.

967
01:03:50,751 --> 01:03:54,619
lt was lousy! Lousy! Nothing worked!

968
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:59,117
You guys out there with the snow,
you made it look like dandruff!

969
01:03:59,193 --> 01:04:02,651
Kevin, l told you,
the minute the doorbell rings, say:

970
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:05,665
''Come on in.'' And stop eating the props!

971
01:04:06,867 --> 01:04:09,597
Can't you get that baby to smile? Smile.

972
01:04:10,004 --> 01:04:12,495
This tree. l hate this tree.

973
01:04:12,573 --> 01:04:16,134
This green tree, l hate. So green tree out.

974
01:04:16,344 --> 01:04:18,642
Bring in the traditional pink one.

975
01:04:18,713 --> 01:04:21,113
-Come on, let's go, guys.
-l loved our tree.

976
01:04:21,182 --> 01:04:25,380
Time is wasting.
Tyler, you were really excellent.

977
01:04:25,886 --> 01:04:29,720
Jefferson, look, you're a little too wooden.

978
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:33,449
Just smile a little more.
You're not playing in a funeral.

979
01:04:33,527 --> 01:04:36,325
l told you, l don't play the piano.
l feel like an idiot.

980
01:04:36,397 --> 01:04:40,493
You don't feel like an idiot
or look like an idiot. You look great.

981
01:04:40,735 --> 01:04:42,896
Would somebody please shut the music?

982
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:45,905
All right, everybody. From the top.

983
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:48,669
Mrs. B.! Some local folks just called...

984
01:04:48,743 --> 01:04:51,177
and invited you to town
for their Christmas dance.

985
01:04:51,245 --> 01:04:52,303
How nice.

986
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:55,941
Seeing as how you don't have anything
else to do, what should l tell them?

987
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,484
Tell them no.

988
01:04:57,818 --> 01:05:00,651
-Tell them yes.
-No, we can't do it!

989
01:05:00,721 --> 01:05:02,985
We've got to make this show
look very spontaneous.

990
01:05:03,057 --> 01:05:05,855
The only way to do that
is to do it over and over again.

991
01:05:05,926 --> 01:05:08,417
Somebody's liable to freeze on television!

992
01:05:08,896 --> 01:05:09,920
Hold it!

993
01:05:09,997 --> 01:05:13,694
-Everybody! Right now, hold it!
-What?

994
01:05:13,768 --> 01:05:15,099
Everybody take a break.

995
01:05:15,169 --> 01:05:17,535
There's such a thing
as too much rehearsing.

996
01:05:17,605 --> 01:05:20,870
No, we can't.
Let's do it one more time, everybody.

997
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,512
-lsn't this beautiful?
-Yeah.

998
01:05:34,855 --> 01:05:36,846
l just love it out here.

999
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:40,692
-Boy, thanks for getting me out of there.
-lt's okay.

1000
01:05:40,761 --> 01:05:44,128
-Your husband can be.... l don't know.
-l know, he gets obnoxious.

1001
01:05:44,198 --> 01:05:47,190
You must run into his type
even in your line of work.

1002
01:05:47,268 --> 01:05:50,260
Not exactly. Maybe an occasional skunk.

1003
01:05:50,538 --> 01:05:52,768
Mr. Jones, you ready to dance?

1004
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:54,835
-Yes.
-Let's do it.

1005
01:06:06,387 --> 01:06:07,786
Honey, look.

1006
01:06:07,855 --> 01:06:10,790
Are you Elizabeth Blane?
l watch your cooking show.

1007
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:12,758
-You're wonderful.
-We love you.

1008
01:06:12,827 --> 01:06:15,352
-Thanks. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1009
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:17,329
lsn't he somebody, too?

1010
01:06:25,206 --> 01:06:27,197
Look, our guests are here!

1011
01:06:28,242 --> 01:06:29,470
Come on!

1012
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:58,601
All right!

1013
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,867
You were terrific.

1014
01:08:08,742 --> 01:08:11,711
-That was great fun.
-l think we'd better go.

1015
01:08:34,001 --> 01:08:36,094
Look, it's a sleigh.

1016
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:38,934
l've always wanted to ride one.
l bet you could drive it.

1017
01:08:39,006 --> 01:08:42,373
-lt's not ours.
-But we could borrow it, couldn't we?

1018
01:08:43,344 --> 01:08:45,141
Come on, let's do it.

1019
01:08:45,212 --> 01:08:46,372
-Get in.
-All right.

1020
01:08:58,726 --> 01:09:00,956
Where the hell is Elizabeth?

1021
01:09:01,328 --> 01:09:03,193
Would somebody.... Will you stop that?

1022
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,528
Will somebody please go
and find me Elizabeth?

1023
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:09,467
She said she'd be right back,
and right back means right back!

1024
01:09:09,703 --> 01:09:13,161
Never mind! l'll go find her myself.

1025
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,231
Nobody's.... Never mind.

1026
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:22,006
-Mr. Prescott. We weren't expecting you.
-This is an important show.

1027
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:25,210
You don't have a problem
with the head of the network being here?

1028
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,720
Are you kidding? Not at all.
Come on in, please.

1029
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:30,120
-Where's Elizabeth?
-Elizabeth is in wardrobe.

1030
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:32,988
Why don't we go look
at some of the production values...

1031
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:36,723
that are going to be insipid in the show?
You'll love what you see tonight.

1032
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:40,494
lt's really gonna be a magnificent show.
Thank you so much.

1033
01:09:42,736 --> 01:09:47,332
-ls that makeup you're wearing?
-No, l don't wear.... Yes, it is.

1034
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:50,806
You see, l'm playing Elizabeth's husband.
No, l'm not....

1035
01:09:51,879 --> 01:09:54,848
l'm not playing as husband,
l am Elizabeth's husband.

1036
01:09:54,915 --> 01:09:56,940
-You're Elizabeth's husband?
-Yes, l am.

1037
01:09:57,017 --> 01:09:59,577
-l thought his name was John Blane.
-lt is.

1038
01:09:59,687 --> 01:10:03,214
You see, l changed my name
for professional reasons.

1039
01:10:03,591 --> 01:10:06,856
-You know how it is.
-That's quite a surprise, Alex.

1040
01:10:07,394 --> 01:10:09,453
l don't like surprises.

1041
01:10:42,062 --> 01:10:43,290
Come on.

1042
01:10:53,173 --> 01:10:56,108
-Are you laughing at me?
-No.

1043
01:10:56,677 --> 01:11:00,773
Believe me, if l'm laughing at anyone,
it's at Elizabeth Blane.

1044
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:01,939
Why?

1045
01:11:03,417 --> 01:11:07,285
She's so smart, you know?
She knows all the answers.

1046
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:10,016
She gets herself into a real mess...

1047
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:13,321
and just hasn't got the moral courage
to get herself out.

1048
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,021
What kind of mess?

1049
01:11:15,462 --> 01:11:17,657
The kind other people
wouldn't understand.

1050
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:21,030
Does it have anything to do
with your marriage?

1051
01:11:23,704 --> 01:11:24,966
ln a way.

1052
01:11:25,806 --> 01:11:28,104
You're not very happy, are you?

1053
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:31,773
-Happy as l have any right to be.
-Don't say that.

1054
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:34,779
You deserve all the happiness you can get.

1055
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,209
l do?

1056
01:11:39,286 --> 01:11:41,254
We'd better turn around.

1057
01:11:42,823 --> 01:11:43,915
Wait.

1058
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:48,019
You hear that? Do you hear it?
Those are the bells.

1059
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:51,390
Those are the Christmas bells. Listen.

1060
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:55,693
Merry Christmas.

1061
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:59,095
Merry Christmas, yourself.

1062
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:22,595
Kevin, don't touch that.

1063
01:12:27,434 --> 01:12:30,232
l said, don't touch that cake, you.

1064
01:12:42,015 --> 01:12:44,108
They're not on the grounds.

1065
01:12:44,184 --> 01:12:46,311
This is not like Elizabeth.

1066
01:12:46,386 --> 01:12:49,583
-Maybe they got into an accident!
-l'm sure they're gonna be fine.

1067
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:52,318
-Just one lick.
-l got to go find her.

1068
01:12:54,361 --> 01:12:56,989
Whatever you do,
don't let Alex in this kitchen.

1069
01:12:57,064 --> 01:12:58,827
lf he finds out l'm gone....

1070
01:12:58,899 --> 01:13:03,097
-Wait, l'll be back in plenty of time.
-Don't worry, l'll take care of Alex.

1071
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:42,903
-Will you get out of my way?
-Are you talking to me?

1072
01:13:42,976 --> 01:13:45,706
-Are you deaf? Move!
-You talking to me?

1073
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:51,712
Ain't nobody else here.
You must be talking to me.

1074
01:13:52,519 --> 01:13:54,646
No, l wasn't talking to you.

1075
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:07,823
Come on, turn!

1076
01:14:11,505 --> 01:14:12,597
Okay.

1077
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:18,734
Let's just for a moment
make believe that...

1078
01:14:20,347 --> 01:14:23,373
-l'm not who you think l am.
-What do you mean?

1079
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:29,280
-What if l didn't live in Connecticut?
-Well, you do.

1080
01:14:29,356 --> 01:14:32,154
But what if that house back there
wasn't my house...

1081
01:14:32,226 --> 01:14:34,717
and that family wasn't my family...

1082
01:14:35,896 --> 01:14:39,263
and Elizabeth Blane,
the homemaker that all America loves...

1083
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:43,929
wasn't even married at all?

1084
01:14:44,338 --> 01:14:46,932
You are married and that's the point.

1085
01:14:47,007 --> 01:14:50,875
l don't think you ought to be fooling
around with somebody's feelings like this.

1086
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:53,344
See, you're not listening to me.

1087
01:14:55,883 --> 01:15:00,149
What if l wasn't the Elizabeth Blane
that you think you know?

1088
01:15:00,687 --> 01:15:02,848
l don't care about that Elizabeth Blane.

1089
01:15:02,923 --> 01:15:06,620
l never even heard of her
until they asked me to do this damn show.

1090
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:09,357
What do you mean you never heard....

1091
01:15:09,429 --> 01:15:12,057
Wait a minute. You never heard of me?

1092
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:14,827
l read one of your books on the plane.

1093
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:18,927
l was getting so much money,
l figured l ought to do my homework.

1094
01:15:19,106 --> 01:15:22,166
You mean that
you came here just because of....

1095
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:24,771
This is not funny.

1096
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:28,780
You only came here for the money?

1097
01:15:29,583 --> 01:15:33,110
And you've never read one of my books.
ls that right? Have you?

1098
01:15:33,186 --> 01:15:35,245
lt means you're nothing but a big phony.

1099
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:38,348
That doesn't change the fact
that you're a married woman.

1100
01:15:38,425 --> 01:15:41,451
Just let me tell you what's really going on.
l am not--

1101
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:46,059
Freeze!

1102
01:15:50,404 --> 01:15:52,895
Stealing my sleigh, and on Christmas, too.

1103
01:15:52,973 --> 01:15:54,497
We didn't steal your sleigh.

1104
01:15:54,574 --> 01:15:58,066
l suppose the horse kidnapped you.
Took you on a 6 mile ride.

1105
01:15:58,145 --> 01:16:01,137
Put your hands where l can see them.
You're both under arrest.

1106
01:16:01,214 --> 01:16:04,274
-Come on.
-Come on, you foreheads, get them up.

1107
01:16:04,384 --> 01:16:05,646
You what?

1108
01:16:20,267 --> 01:16:21,734
Look at this.

1109
01:16:25,105 --> 01:16:27,403
Let me have a look at it. Let me see.

1110
01:16:27,774 --> 01:16:30,436
What kind of a show are you running here?

1111
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:32,307
-What's going on here?
-She'll be here.

1112
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:34,506
-And where's Elizabeth?
-Where is she?

1113
01:16:34,581 --> 01:16:36,412
Every one of those people
are on the clock!

1114
01:16:36,483 --> 01:16:37,711
Don't worry. lt's all right.

1115
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:47,592
The local police wish you a happy holiday.

1116
01:16:47,661 --> 01:16:49,891
A $200 ticket. Yes, l'm fine.

1117
01:16:52,366 --> 01:16:55,563
Welcome home, darling.
You're on in five minutes!

1118
01:16:56,003 --> 01:16:58,369
-She's here.
-So are you.

1119
01:16:58,438 --> 01:16:59,996
Where is she coming from?

1120
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:02,041
She's here now. Four minutes.

1121
01:17:02,109 --> 01:17:06,273
Let me take you to the control room.
You'll love this place. Come along.

1122
01:17:08,448 --> 01:17:11,178
And welcome to
the live special presentation of...

1123
01:17:17,224 --> 01:17:19,590
and her real-life family .

1124
01:17:19,726 --> 01:17:21,557
Okay, we need the title card up.

1125
01:17:21,628 --> 01:17:24,791
...by America 's favorite hero,
Jefferson Jones.

1126
01:17:24,865 --> 01:17:28,460
And now here is your hostess,
Elizabeth Blane!

1127
01:17:28,535 --> 01:17:30,662
Merry Christmas and welcome.

1128
01:17:31,171 --> 01:17:33,799
l'm Elizabeth Blane and this is my home.

1129
01:17:33,874 --> 01:17:37,469
I'm so glad you could join us tonight.
We're going to have a wonderfuI time.

1130
01:17:37,544 --> 01:17:39,205
I just want you all to sit back...

1131
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:43,215
relax and enjoy a good,
old-fashioned Christmas in Connecticut.

1132
01:17:43,316 --> 01:17:45,944
For so many years,
you've heard me talk about my family.

1133
01:17:46,019 --> 01:17:48,214
Now l'm delighted
l get to introduce them to you.

1134
01:17:48,288 --> 01:17:51,280
Okay, here we go. We're gonna pull out.
All right.

1135
01:17:51,358 --> 01:17:55,385
Here's this beautiful little pudge-face,
my granddaughter, Melissa.

1136
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:56,929
Look at that.

1137
01:17:57,164 --> 01:17:59,689
My very handsome son-in-law, Evan...

1138
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:03,694
and my beautiful daughter, Mary,
who isn't here.

1139
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:04,759
Where's Mary?

1140
01:18:04,871 --> 01:18:07,271
What does she mean, ''Where's Mary?''

1141
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:10,537
l just remembered.
l sent her out to get some marshmallows.

1142
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:12,908
All right, never mind. She saved it.

1143
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:14,844
She went out to look for you.

1144
01:18:16,383 --> 01:18:19,841
This little rascal is my grandson, Kevin.
Wipe your face, dear.

1145
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,412
Later l'm going to make his favorite,
chocolate coconut angels.

1146
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:25,253
Wait, too fast. Hold on. Just a second.

1147
01:18:25,325 --> 01:18:28,624
-l don't feel so good.
-You don't? l hope you do later...

1148
01:18:28,695 --> 01:18:31,858
because we want to save
some room for that goose, don't we?

1149
01:18:31,932 --> 01:18:34,901
Here's my loving husband, John.

1150
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:40,233
Hello, sweetheart.
How are you doing, darling?

1151
01:18:41,108 --> 01:18:42,735
-Honey....
-What?

1152
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:45,200
What's for....

1153
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:49,611
Yes, tell something.
Say something! Speak!

1154
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:51,412
Sweetheart, l want you to relax.

1155
01:18:51,485 --> 01:18:55,114
All the millions of people that
are watching out there are our friends.

1156
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:57,156
l have no idea what's going on.

1157
01:18:57,224 --> 01:19:00,625
Why don't you tell them all
about your special recipe...

1158
01:19:00,727 --> 01:19:02,854
for the Blane family eggnog?

1159
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:04,220
Nog?

1160
01:19:04,297 --> 01:19:06,788
Nog! What does ''nog'' mean?

1161
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,630
The nog. He's sweet.

1162
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:12,604
Later we were gonna pop some popcorn
the old-fashioned way.

1163
01:19:12,672 --> 01:19:15,971
We have a popper over here, a fire.
Why don't we do that now?

1164
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:18,602
Just sit down here, wait, and relax.

1165
01:19:19,946 --> 01:19:22,847
-l think l'm gonna throw up.
-Yes, dear, we know.

1166
01:19:22,916 --> 01:19:25,646
Let's go into the kitchen
and see how dinner is going.

1167
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,744
What? What is she doing?

1168
01:19:27,821 --> 01:19:30,381
This is.... Give me a shot of the kid.

1169
01:19:30,457 --> 01:19:32,448
Yeah, three. Oh, boy.

1170
01:19:33,793 --> 01:19:36,125
l don't need to see a shot
of the kid throwing up!

1171
01:19:36,196 --> 01:19:37,788
This is live television.

1172
01:19:37,864 --> 01:19:41,630
All that wonderful food.
Doesn't it smell nice?

1173
01:19:41,701 --> 01:19:44,636
But the kitchen's not ready.
Tell the crew to get out of there!

1174
01:19:44,704 --> 01:19:47,002
Smell those yummy things in here,
can't you?

1175
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:50,702
-Give me another camera.
-All right. Can we lose that?

1176
01:19:50,777 --> 01:19:52,074
l can't believe this!

1177
01:19:52,145 --> 01:19:54,409
A meal like this takes a lot of preparation.

1178
01:19:54,481 --> 01:19:57,746
But fortunately, we've had so much time...

1179
01:20:01,321 --> 01:20:03,221
to prepare all this beautiful food.

1180
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:07,522
lsn't it lovely? Raw broccoli. Don't you
just love the snap and crackle of that?

1181
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:09,619
Let's check on our golden goose.

1182
01:20:10,030 --> 01:20:11,827
-lt's your shot, Jerry.
-What?

1183
01:20:13,366 --> 01:20:16,062
Well, it's not golden. But it's white.

1184
01:20:17,204 --> 01:20:21,402
l think what's happened is
the stove is broken.

1185
01:20:21,641 --> 01:20:24,439
Don't you just hate that
when that happens on the holidays?

1186
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:27,412
l tell you! Do you have any idea
what it would cost...

1187
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:31,280
to have a repairman come out here
and fix the stove on Christmas?

1188
01:20:31,351 --> 01:20:32,875
But never mind.

1189
01:20:33,019 --> 01:20:35,954
You came here to see me cook.
l'm gonna cook for you.

1190
01:20:36,022 --> 01:20:37,990
What's she doing?
Why is she doing this to me?

1191
01:20:38,058 --> 01:20:42,324
Did she wake up this morning thinking,
''l'll kill my career on national television''?

1192
01:20:45,832 --> 01:20:49,529
You know, folks, sometimes
the best things in life are the simplest.

1193
01:20:49,903 --> 01:20:52,303
l mean, this is as good as it gets.

1194
01:20:52,939 --> 01:20:54,463
Christmas flapjacks.

1195
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:55,838
Excuse me?

1196
01:20:55,909 --> 01:20:58,901
Christmas flapjacks, a Blane tradition.

1197
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:01,777
l have been cooking flapjacks
for this family....

1198
01:21:01,848 --> 01:21:05,443
l've been cooking flapjacks for this family
since l had this family.

1199
01:21:05,518 --> 01:21:07,816
But wait. A knock at the door.

1200
01:21:07,887 --> 01:21:11,948
Do you know who that is?
That's our special guest, Jefferson Jones!

1201
01:21:12,025 --> 01:21:15,426
Get the camera on the door.
Clear the door, please. Cue the Mountie.

1202
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:18,191
...who risked his life in a blizzard...

1203
01:21:18,965 --> 01:21:21,263
to save little Billy Futterman.

1204
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:23,598
Let's welcome him. Coming!

1205
01:21:25,205 --> 01:21:29,471
Hey, Jeff! Come on in. Look at you!
Love your hat.

1206
01:21:29,876 --> 01:21:31,400
Wasn't my idea.

1207
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,407
Welcome to my kitchen, Jeff.

1208
01:21:35,482 --> 01:21:39,316
-No, l came all the way from Colorado.
-You did? lsn't that nice.

1209
01:21:42,489 --> 01:21:45,253
What's that terrific smell?
Christmas goose?

1210
01:21:45,325 --> 01:21:48,351
-No, not quite. Not exactly.
-My favorite.

1211
01:21:48,428 --> 01:21:50,259
l'm so glad.

1212
01:21:51,064 --> 01:21:53,862
l'm just here making flapjacks.

1213
01:21:53,933 --> 01:21:56,197
My Christmas flapjacks,
which is a tradition.

1214
01:21:56,269 --> 01:21:59,864
Why don't you sit down over here
and talk to me while l cook?

1215
01:21:59,939 --> 01:22:02,430
There's nothing better
than a big family Christmas.

1216
01:22:02,509 --> 01:22:07,037
That's right. That's why it's so nice
to get together with people like you...

1217
01:22:07,113 --> 01:22:09,343
so you can catch up
on everything happening.

1218
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:11,680
Why don't you tell me
about your home in Colorado?

1219
01:22:11,751 --> 01:22:12,877
lt burned down.

1220
01:22:12,952 --> 01:22:15,580
That's right, l forgot.
How thoughtless of me.

1221
01:22:15,655 --> 01:22:18,624
-No wonder you're so confused.
-l'm confused?

1222
01:22:18,692 --> 01:22:20,660
What the hell is she talking about?

1223
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:24,128
-l've no idea what she's talking about.
-Joel, go to commercial.

1224
01:22:24,197 --> 01:22:28,156
Someone please tell Mrs. Blane
to go to commercial!

1225
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:30,498
All right. Go to commercial. Cut.

1226
01:22:32,172 --> 01:22:34,265
This batter looks wonderful.

1227
01:22:34,341 --> 01:22:37,435
Why don't we take a short break
and when we come back...

1228
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:39,705
we'll see how these flapjacks turn out.

1229
01:22:40,146 --> 01:22:41,272
And we're clear.

1230
01:22:41,348 --> 01:22:45,614
All right, where's the food? Wait a minute.
Don't anybody move. Just hold it.

1231
01:22:46,486 --> 01:22:48,078
Where is the food?

1232
01:22:48,154 --> 01:22:50,418
-Where is all the food?
-We haven't seen it.

1233
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:52,253
How am l supposed to....

1234
01:22:52,325 --> 01:22:54,850
The food's not done. Where is Josie?

1235
01:22:56,062 --> 01:22:58,929
Josie wouldn't do this to me,
she wouldn't leave me here.

1236
01:22:58,998 --> 01:23:00,693
l don't want the phone! You're fired.

1237
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:02,632
Get me some coffee, and then you're fired.

1238
01:23:02,702 --> 01:23:05,330
Where's the food?
Will somebody answer me?

1239
01:23:05,405 --> 01:23:07,999
How am l supposed to go on?
There is no cooked food!

1240
01:23:08,074 --> 01:23:09,769
Aren't you supposed to cook it?

1241
01:23:09,843 --> 01:23:12,175
You still don't get it, do you? Listen to me.

1242
01:23:12,245 --> 01:23:15,237
My life is falling apart
in front of millions of people...

1243
01:23:15,315 --> 01:23:16,942
on live television.

1244
01:23:17,016 --> 01:23:19,917
ln an hour, there's not going to be
any Elizabeth Blane.

1245
01:23:19,986 --> 01:23:22,546
There's not gonna be.... Alex!

1246
01:23:23,556 --> 01:23:26,423
We've got a few technical problems.
You're a pro!

1247
01:23:26,493 --> 01:23:29,587
Alex, you are insane!
Now l want you to call this off right now.

1248
01:23:29,662 --> 01:23:31,857
Alex? l thought his name was John.

1249
01:23:31,931 --> 01:23:34,593
-Call it off now. l mean it.
-Listen to me!

1250
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:37,500
l won't let you throw away
20 years of a good thing...

1251
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:40,562
because some goose isn't cooked.
l know you can do it.

1252
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,267
-Call this off--
-Listen to me.

1253
01:23:42,342 --> 01:23:45,709
l want you to go out there
and be the real Elizabeth Blane.

1254
01:23:45,779 --> 01:23:48,111
Do it! l invented you.

1255
01:23:48,181 --> 01:23:50,445
This is prime-time live.

1256
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:53,643
lf this works, there are specials, movies.

1257
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,381
We'll be rolling in everything.

1258
01:23:55,455 --> 01:23:59,414
And we'll be able to do this together
for the rest of our lives.

1259
01:24:01,361 --> 01:24:05,161
l want you to out there
and give me the real Elizabeth Blane.

1260
01:24:05,532 --> 01:24:07,261
You're great. Do it.

1261
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:11,766
We're back in 10 seconds. Places, people!

1262
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:13,669
What are we gonna do?

1263
01:24:15,074 --> 01:24:17,008
-Calm down.
-All right.

1264
01:24:18,578 --> 01:24:22,537
When you quit your job
to go live in the woods, were you scared?

1265
01:24:24,284 --> 01:24:25,581
Yeah, but it was worth it.

1266
01:24:25,652 --> 01:24:27,620
-Everyone quiet.
-Good luck.

1267
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:29,120
And we're back!

1268
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:32,750
Come on. Just pull it together.
That's all you got to do.

1269
01:24:35,829 --> 01:24:38,730
l've been told
that the purpose of this program...

1270
01:24:38,798 --> 01:24:43,292
is to show you the real Elizabeth Blane
and how she spends her Christmas.

1271
01:24:44,437 --> 01:24:47,304
Well, the last place l would be
is in the kitchen.

1272
01:24:49,809 --> 01:24:51,140
So follow me.

1273
01:24:56,416 --> 01:24:58,907
What am l watching here? This is....

1274
01:24:58,985 --> 01:25:00,384
Just tell me what to do, Joel.

1275
01:25:00,453 --> 01:25:03,081
Just wherever she goes. l don't know!

1276
01:25:03,289 --> 01:25:07,055
Hurry up. Let's go. Keep the boom up.
Make room. Excuse me.

1277
01:25:07,126 --> 01:25:11,085
Here we are in my living room,
except this isn't my living room.

1278
01:25:11,631 --> 01:25:13,622
This isn't even my house.

1279
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:17,136
You see, we're in Connecticut,
but l live in New York.

1280
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:19,933
-You do?
-ln fact, it isn't even snowing.

1281
01:25:20,039 --> 01:25:22,906
Jeff, would you show everyone
what's behind Curtain Number....

1282
01:25:22,976 --> 01:25:24,739
You don't know
what Curtain Number One is.

1283
01:25:24,811 --> 01:25:26,608
That window there. Pull back the curtain.

1284
01:25:26,679 --> 01:25:28,943
-What's she doing?
-l have no idea.

1285
01:25:29,015 --> 01:25:32,041
Take a look at this. See? lt's fake snow.

1286
01:25:32,118 --> 01:25:34,177
Go ahead. Thrill me. What's next?

1287
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:38,623
Now what l'd like to do is to introduce you
to all the people who make this possible.

1288
01:25:38,691 --> 01:25:40,056
Do something.

1289
01:25:40,126 --> 01:25:43,687
-See who's here. The carolers, at the door.
-How lovely.

1290
01:25:44,163 --> 01:25:46,393
This man over here is not my son-in-law.

1291
01:25:46,466 --> 01:25:47,660
Get out of my way.

1292
01:25:47,734 --> 01:25:49,565
-His name is Tyler.
-Open that door!

1293
01:25:49,636 --> 01:25:53,231
All right, everybody in!
Let's get dressed and get ready to sing.

1294
01:25:53,306 --> 01:25:55,433
Look at that face. He's an actor.

1295
01:25:55,542 --> 01:25:58,067
This is your moment,
so show them what you can do.

1296
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:59,907
Go ahead. You're on.

1297
01:26:02,148 --> 01:26:05,811
Hi. l am available
and seeking new representation.

1298
01:26:05,885 --> 01:26:08,285
-What's he doing?
-I can do romance.

1299
01:26:09,255 --> 01:26:11,587
O, that I were a glove upon that hand...

1300
01:26:11,658 --> 01:26:13,489
That I might touch that cheek!

1301
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:16,220
He's.... ls this acting?

1302
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:19,595
Put your coats on. Put a smile
on your face. Let me look at you.

1303
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:22,829
The sounds of bones crunching
in the moonlight...

1304
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:25,195
keep me awake, awake...

1305
01:26:25,872 --> 01:26:27,066
awake.

1306
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,132
l can't believe what l'm seeing!
What l'm seeing is death.

1307
01:26:30,209 --> 01:26:31,972
-Do you hear me?
-Excuse me, Joel.

1308
01:26:32,045 --> 01:26:34,036
What? Don't ever touch me!

1309
01:26:34,113 --> 01:26:35,910
All right, everybody, get ready. Sing!

1310
01:26:41,721 --> 01:26:43,211
Let's go, everybody.

1311
01:26:43,289 --> 01:26:44,847
This isn't my granddaughter.

1312
01:26:44,924 --> 01:26:48,724
God forbid, at my age l should be
a grandmother? Give me a break.

1313
01:26:48,928 --> 01:26:50,953
Come on in. The door is open!

1314
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:54,295
This little guy over here, that's not Kevin.
That's Anthony.

1315
01:26:59,772 --> 01:27:01,899
Louder! Come on, give it to me!

1316
01:27:05,244 --> 01:27:06,734
Carnegie Hall waits!

1317
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,474
We just came to pick up the kids.

1318
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:13,144
Great! This is too much.

1319
01:27:13,386 --> 01:27:16,913
These people are the real parents
of the baby and Kevin.

1320
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:18,287
Mom ! Dad!

1321
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:25,326
And the tree's fallen over, of course.
Why would it remain standing?

1322
01:27:25,398 --> 01:27:29,027
Don't you worry.
l hated this tree, this fake old pink thing.

1323
01:27:29,102 --> 01:27:32,902
l didn't like it. Norah, come and help!
Jeff, where's our tree?

1324
01:27:32,972 --> 01:27:36,237
We actually have a Christmas tree.
We went out and cut one down.

1325
01:27:36,309 --> 01:27:40,177
-Jeff, would you bring our tree in?
-l hate the green tree. They're putting it in.

1326
01:27:40,246 --> 01:27:43,909
They got rid of the pink.
Believe me, it all worked in the rehearsal.

1327
01:27:43,983 --> 01:27:46,213
l can't believe this. Here she is.

1328
01:27:46,285 --> 01:27:48,776
-l'm sorry.
-No, Josie, don't be silly.

1329
01:27:48,855 --> 01:27:52,256
-This is Josie.
-Let me guess. She's not her daughter.

1330
01:27:52,325 --> 01:27:55,158
She is not my daughter.
She's my assistant.

1331
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:56,354
l wanna tell you something.

1332
01:27:56,429 --> 01:27:59,057
She's probably the best cook
in the whole wide world.

1333
01:27:59,132 --> 01:28:02,363
You know, all those wonderful dishes
that everybody thinks l make...

1334
01:28:02,435 --> 01:28:03,231
this lady makes.

1335
01:28:03,636 --> 01:28:05,126
Thanks, Josie.

1336
01:28:05,738 --> 01:28:07,763
So what have we got here?

1337
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:11,469
We've got fake snow, fake house,
fake Christmas.

1338
01:28:11,978 --> 01:28:14,412
But the biggest fake of all is me.

1339
01:28:15,481 --> 01:28:18,678
l'm really sorry.
l never meant it to go this far.

1340
01:28:19,352 --> 01:28:22,412
But you see, l can't cook.

1341
01:28:22,789 --> 01:28:23,881
What?

1342
01:28:23,956 --> 01:28:27,414
l'll kill you!
l can't believe you're doing this to me!

1343
01:28:27,794 --> 01:28:30,092
Stop! Don't go on!

1344
01:28:30,163 --> 01:28:32,393
April fool, everybody.

1345
01:28:32,465 --> 01:28:35,229
lt's not true.
She's the greatest cook that ever was.

1346
01:28:35,301 --> 01:28:39,101
She's lying. She's going off her head.
She hasn't taken her medication.

1347
01:28:39,172 --> 01:28:41,402
-Let go of her.
-Hey, listen, Hee Haw--

1348
01:28:45,044 --> 01:28:47,672
All right, he punched him in the face!

1349
01:28:48,081 --> 01:28:50,174
Hey, move in! Get a close-up of that.

1350
01:28:50,249 --> 01:28:52,809
l want to see his bruise,
bleeding if there's any.

1351
01:28:52,885 --> 01:28:55,285
Will you cut the cameras?
Get away from me.

1352
01:28:55,354 --> 01:28:57,083
lt's over. Finished!

1353
01:28:57,156 --> 01:28:59,784
My hero. What have you done?

1354
01:28:59,859 --> 01:29:02,760
This is a whole new
kind of behavior for you.

1355
01:29:03,162 --> 01:29:05,596
That's it! Alex, you're fired!

1356
01:29:06,199 --> 01:29:08,030
You're fired!

1357
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:12,060
This is beautiful. You're fired! Get out!
Everyone's fired.

1358
01:29:12,772 --> 01:29:16,799
Now tell me, please,
he's not really your husband.

1359
01:29:17,543 --> 01:29:19,067
l'm not married.

1360
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:23,047
Elizabeth, you're fired!
l don't even know you, but you're fired.

1361
01:29:23,116 --> 01:29:27,280
Out of here, everyone. Get out!
You're all fired! Out!

1362
01:29:27,954 --> 01:29:30,047
Yes. Move in.

1363
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:32,685
-You're sure?
-l'm sure.

1364
01:29:36,395 --> 01:29:38,022
That's what l want. Yes.

1365
01:29:38,097 --> 01:29:41,464
We regret to say that
we are unable to continue this program....

1366
01:29:41,534 --> 01:29:44,196
They yanked us?
l can't believe they cut us off!

1367
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:46,534
No! l can't believe you!

1368
01:30:14,867 --> 01:30:19,031
Cooking's really easy when
you just follow the directions, isn't it?

1369
01:30:21,808 --> 01:30:24,572
You could come practice your cooking
in Colorado.

1370
01:30:25,144 --> 01:30:27,044
l'd love to do that...

1371
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:31,213
but l'm just a city girl, really.

1372
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:36,419
Who's that?

1373
01:30:39,892 --> 01:30:42,554
-Oh, no.
-Elizabeth, just hear me out.

1374
01:30:42,628 --> 01:30:46,120
The ratings were unprecedented.
The network has been flooded with calls.

1375
01:30:46,199 --> 01:30:47,598
This is big.

1376
01:30:48,201 --> 01:30:50,328
l fired you, Alex. Shut up!

1377
01:30:51,637 --> 01:30:54,572
You would be an important part
of our television family.

1378
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,768
-l'm not interested.
-l'm prepared to offer you...

1379
01:30:57,844 --> 01:30:59,243
twice what we paid you before.

1380
01:30:59,312 --> 01:31:01,405
Won't you come in, Mr. Prescott?

1381
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,074
Didn't the other network
offer you five times as much?

1382
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:05,412
-Five times?
-That's right.

1383
01:31:05,484 --> 01:31:06,974
Alex, shut up.

1384
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,886
Elizabeth, at least consider the offer.

1385
01:31:09,956 --> 01:31:14,120
lf l were to consider doing television,
l'd have to do it on my own terms.

1386
01:31:14,193 --> 01:31:16,320
-No faking.
-''No more faking.''

1387
01:31:16,529 --> 01:31:18,656
-What a title for your book!
-What book?

1388
01:31:18,731 --> 01:31:21,256
That People magazine article?
That could be the outline.

1389
01:31:21,334 --> 01:31:23,666
This could mean movies--

1390
01:31:24,136 --> 01:31:26,195
-Shut up.
-Shut up.

1391
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:33,871
You know what, Mr. Prescott?
We'll call you from Colorado.

1392
01:31:34,313 --> 01:31:37,248
Jefferson's rebuilding his house,
and l'm going to help him.

1393
01:31:37,316 --> 01:31:38,578
Colorado?

1394
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:41,644
Bye-bye.

1395
01:31:41,721 --> 01:31:43,154
But wait. l know, l'm fired.

1396
01:31:43,222 --> 01:31:45,190
Nice knowing you. Happy New Year.

1397
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:18,939
English
