Yeah.

15
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:09,379
Not really.

16
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:22,131
Thanks for the news.

17
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,269
I haven't known for long.

18
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:38,843
I just decided,
I decided on Butte.

19
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:41,063
Butte, Montana.

20
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:51,900
What do I need that makes me
make these decisions?

21
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:57,427
You got me.

22
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:06,218

What does Beth say?

She says...

25
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:17,839
Beth says whatever makes me
happy, that's what she says.

With me driving?

33
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:15,026
Twenty-two hours.

34
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,854
That's not bad.

35
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:21,642
In my car? It's a fuckin'
nightmare.

36
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:24,340
And there's no good radio in
Utah.

37
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:29,954

-Get saved.

38

41
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,052
Think about this.

42
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:43,185
Take a detour

43
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:47,232

Kick off the trip.

45
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:50,888
You and Beth can have

00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:53,935
see a show, play the slots,

47
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:56,894
get the free drinks.

48
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:58,505
No, that's too much money.

49
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,379
The show, the meal, the slots.

50
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,991
Then there's the hotel.

51
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:09,385
That's another hundred
down the toilet.

52
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,908
No!

53
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:13,737
You skip the hotel--it's night.

54
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:15,304

56
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:20,135
You, uh, you start speeding.

57
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:21,832
'Cause you've got
a little buzz on.

58
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:24,356
You get stopped in Utah

60

You go to prison,

64
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,804

has taken a direction!

I'm all yours.

74
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:11,926
Wait--make it mine,
I've got the short shift.

75
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:17,540
Do you want me to come over
after?

76
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:21,805
Help pack?

77
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,155
Yeah, that'd be great.

78
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,941
I'm--I'm really--
I'm really sorry

00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:29,465
we didn't tell you any sooner,
it's...

he just...

81
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:34,949
Yeah, oh, I understand.

82
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:41,303
Bye.

83
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,707
Fuckin' Nick.

84
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:03,151
I'm tired,
I'm going to bed.

85
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:04,979
What's your problem?

86
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:08,504
I haven't got a problem.

87
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,071
Okay.

88
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,338
You agreed to try Butte.

89
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,646
Yeah, I know--Butte, Montana,
city of the future.

90
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,038
Yeah, I read that a while ago,

91
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:23,824
so the future's probably
already there.

92
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,785
It's not like you're leaving
anything behind,

93
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,482
a good job or something.

94
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:33,007
No, just some friends.

95
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,922
You'll make new friends.

96
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,401
I know.

97
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:40,536
I'm not eight years old,
I know I'll make new friends.

98
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,146
So what is it?

99
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,761
Uh...

100
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,414
it embarrasses me.

101
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:54,724
I mean, the way that you and
Carol are together sometimes.

102
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,204
She's my best friend

103
00:09:56,247 --> 00:10:00,948
and it embarrasses methat you used to live with her.

104
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:02,340
That was years ago.

105
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,951
It was three years.

106
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:05,605
Yeah.

107
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:12,002
We're moving, so...

108
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:14,614
she won't be your best friend
anymore.

109
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:32,457
Livin' with someone
isn't such a big deal.

110
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:37,158
Anyway, I live with you now.

It's rainin'.

118
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:34,302
It does that.

119
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,303
Since we got it?

120
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:37,827
No, lately.

121
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,916

Never kept the coffee hot,
and now this.

125
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,794
It still works.

I don't know why
we're even bothering to pack.

137
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,185
You got me.

138
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:33,927
Can't believe we don't have
a good TV.

139
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,929
Well, we don't watch much.

140
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:39,323
Yeah, but at our age...

141
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,543
Why don't you take one?

142
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:43,980
Ain't hungry.

143
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,243
Not a doughnut--a TV.

144
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:50,944
I might do it.

145
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:52,684
I say do it.

146
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:55,470
They can afford
to give you a bonus.

147
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,341
Maybe they are.

148
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:58,429
What do you mean?

149
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:00,823
Maybe when I get my check today,

150
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:03,391
there'll be a bonus in it.

151
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:06,133
Nick, they fired you.

152
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:07,612
Yeah.

153
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,441
There's no bonus.

154
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:12,400
Yeah.

155
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:16,186
And I sold a lot of TVs for 'em.

156
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,622
I should go.

157
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,450
Don't wanna be late
on my last day.

for hell.

Hey, um, I heard that you're
leaving us.

168
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:34,438
Yep. I'm outta here.

169

They can you?

170
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,529
That's what they think.

171
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,314
Yeah?

172
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:42,882
Yeah, I was gonna quit anyway.

173
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,535
This way, I get unemployment.

174
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,539

for the layoffs to start.

00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:59,654
I've done this house before.

191
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:01,786
Did a pretty good job.

192
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,355
Won't have to redo the trim.

193
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,576
Oh, fuck--could you come back
tomorrow?

194
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:11,100
Tomorrow's Sunday.

195
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:12,797
Yeah?

196
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,538
New tenants move in on Sunday.

197
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,934
Where you movin' to?

198
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,285
Um, Butte, Montana.

199
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:25,549
Why?

200
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:29,553
Can't be any worse than Enfield,Arizona.

201
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:32,687
I've lived in Enfield my whole
life.

202
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,037
You hold this?

203
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:37,257
It's masking tape.

204
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,433
I use it to mask.

205
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:42,305
Do you ever use masking tape tomask?

206
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:43,741
No, I haven't.

207
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:45,047
[tape snaps]

208
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:06,329
Sorry I'm late.

209
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:07,809
The new girl is a moron.

210
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:09,115
What's that?

211
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:13,249
A going-away present.

212
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:14,598
Thanks!

213
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:25,827
A map.

214
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,263
I thought you might need it.

215
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:28,656
I do.

216
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,571
I had a map, I lost it.

217
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:34,966
Let's highlight your route.

218
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,713
Okay.

219
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,150
Here's Enfield.

220
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:50,678
Here's Butte.

221
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:53,463
Where?

222
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:54,595
Right there.

223
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:55,987
Okay.

224
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,775
[humming]

225
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:05,562
-Look at that.
-What?

226
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:06,563
-Right there?
-Uh-huh.

227
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:08,609
Halfway?

228
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:11,829
That's the town I was born in.

229
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:16,051
Where I grew up,
where my parents live.

230
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,835
Isn't that a coincidence.

231
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,840
Visit 'em.

232
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:24,146
Nope.

233
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:29,020
You're gonna be driving by.

234
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:30,848
Nope.

235
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:33,764
They're not near the interstate.

236
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:36,376
I haven't even called them in
years.

237
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,986
You might as well visit.

238
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,640
Nope.

239
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:40,858
Why not?

240
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:42,512
Wouldn't know 'em.

241
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:48,910
Wait, let me.

242
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,619
Pretty good.

243
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,147
I'm starving.

244
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:13,543
-Oops.
-Hello?

245
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:16,155
[mellow music]

246
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:45,967
I'm lucky I don't have to kill
'em.

247
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,795
What?

248
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:49,710
If these walls were any darker,

249
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,929
I'd have to put a layer of killdown first

250
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:56,151
so that the old paint
wouldn't bleed through.

251
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,545
Oh.

252
00:19:58,588 --> 00:19:59,894
Yep.

253
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:06,422
Kill is an alcohol-based paint.

254
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:07,815
Covers the old paint

255
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:09,817
so that you'd never know
it was there, but--

256
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,821
but when it's drying,
it gives off these fumes.

257
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:16,215
The fumes are noxious.

258
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,042
Noxious fumes.

259
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:22,351
They, uh, they'd probably
find us on the floor,

260
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,961
unconscious.

261
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:25,311
"They"?

262
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:28,531
Yeah, the "they" that find
people unconscious.

263
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:31,055
-Nick.
-Nick.

264
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:34,407
Nick, the man I live with.

265
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,800
I guess he'd be the "they."

266
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,846
Yes.

267
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:40,108
He'd find us,

268
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:42,458
and he'd be surprised.

269
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:50,684
It was the drive
that killed us.

270
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:52,163
Ugh.

271
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:56,037
San Antonio to Seattleis just too many hours in a car.

272
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,040
-If we'da flown, we'da made it.
-No!

273
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,390
Things were all right in bed.

274
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:04,872
Yeah, but the rest of the time,they were awful.

275
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,743
-Really?
-Yeah! Nick,

276
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,832
we couldn't stand each other.

277
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:12,401
When we got to Enfield,
I dumped you, and, uh,

278
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:14,838
we just stayed.

279
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:19,060
Why didn't you go on to Seattle?It was your car.

280
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:20,975
Big trees scare me.

281
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:27,024
I'm thinkin' about stealin'
a TV.

282
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:28,417
What?

283
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:32,943
I'm thinkin' about stealin'
a TV!

284
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:34,075
Good!

285
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,647
I'm, uh, done in here,
except for the ceiling.

286
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,126
But I'm gonna hold off on that

287
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,172
until you've got
your furniture out.

288
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:46,130
Uh, I don't think we're gonna betaking too much

289
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:48,437
of the furniture, though.

290
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:51,962
No? How come?

291
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:54,400
It's ugly.

292
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,010
No it's not, it's...

293
00:21:56,053 --> 00:22:00,449
That's fine, it's--it's
a pretty good-looking couch.

294
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:04,192
Oh. It's not a couch, it's a
sofa bed.

295
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:07,021
And it weighs 2,000 pounds.

296
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:08,544
Wow.

297
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:10,546
It's not--it's not ugly, though.

298
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,941
I-I tell you, we had a sofa bedwhen I was a kid,

299
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:16,160
it was the world's ugliest sofabed,

300
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:20,034
it was orange and red and purplestripes.

301
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:22,950
Phew.

302
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:25,431
You're not gonna take it,
you're just gonna abandon it?

303
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,088
Wow.

304
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:34,875
Can I have it?

305
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,141
It's yours.

306
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:41,534
Excellent!

307
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:55,069
Nick's gonna steal a TV!

308
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:58,638
Who are you?

309
00:22:58,681 --> 00:22:59,900
The painter.

310
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:01,858
He's really gonna do it?

311
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:04,861
He says yes!
We have to talk.

312
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:07,342
About the crime?

313
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,517
There's no crime.

314
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,040
Nick's gonna steal a TV.

315
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:11,868
That's just an expression.

316
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:13,870
I've never heard that
expression.

317
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:15,176
It's makin' the rounds.

318
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:17,221
College students use it.

319
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,788
Where's he stealing it from?

320
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,964
-His mall.
-You want him to know?

321
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,531
He knows! He doesn't care.
Do you care?

322
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:25,012
I'm interested.
Crime's interesting.

323
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,143
It's not a crime.

324
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:29,016
-It's justice.
-It's poetic justice.

325
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:30,539
-How?
-They fired him.

326
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,932
He's got motive.

327
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:33,716
-Who is this guy?
-The painter.

328
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,196
-Sid.
-Sid.

329
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,900
He needs you at the store.

330
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,077
He needs me?

Why, thank you.

00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:08,507
Do you wanna get stoned?

00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,078
Yeah.

It's boring.

Really?

351
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:39,276
It's not very good.
It's homegrown.

352

-But it'll get you fucked up.
-Really?

353
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,110
Oh, it'll take you someplace.

354
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:52,289
We'll see.

355
00:25:56,424 --> 00:26:00,341
-Thought about American?
-Nope.

and they'll give you your
brand-new, beautiful TV set.

374
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:03,534
I get the TV?

375
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:05,667
Out back.

376
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:08,496
They'll help you load it in yourcar and everything.

377
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:14,023
Think about American.

378
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:16,417
Mostly Japanese parts, anyhow.

379
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,027
Excuse me, I just--

380
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,247
Miss, I'm dealing with this
customer here.

381
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,293
Perhaps you'd like to ask
someone else.

382
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:27,384
You mean you can't help me?

383
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:30,866
Not really. No.

384
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:43,009
It's very small.

385
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:44,575
Yes it is.

388
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:12,272
Excellent.

389
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,412
Maybe I should just leave it
packed.

390
00:29:22,456 --> 00:29:23,805
What?

391
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,415
Oh, come on!

392
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:27,069
You stole this,
you gotta look at the loot.

393
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:30,420
Come on. Here, you hold the
bottom and I'll lift it up.

394
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:35,251
It'll be easy.

395
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:38,124
Wait.

396
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:41,170
Thought I heard the police.

397
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:43,259
Ha-ha-ha!

398
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:47,394
What?

399
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:50,310
-What?
-You're stoned.

400
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:51,615
Me?

401
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,617
You are stoned!

402
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,184
Busted.

403
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:58,318
Busted is right, Mr. Bunny Eyes.

404
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:01,974
I can't believe that you're
painting my house stoned.

405
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:04,672
Well, I'm just..I'm just a little stoned, but...

406
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:06,413
-Oh yeah.
-...I'm not that stoned.

407
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:10,721
-Oh no?
-No.

408
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:12,854
Carol is really stoned.

409
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:17,728
You got Carol stoned?

410
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,078
Very stoned.

411
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,779
I didn't think she liked you.

412
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,259
She doesn't.

413
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:28,304
But she likes getting stoned.

414
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:31,177
She does.

415
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,743
There's nothing like drugs

416
00:30:32,787 --> 00:30:35,529
to create a quick and shallow
friendship.

417
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:41,970
Wow.

418
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:44,843
You didn't fool around.

419

-Hola!
-Hi! Come see.

I should've had him steal me onetoo.

Well, you can come over
and watch.

-You're moving.
-Oh yeah, right, right.

How's the painting going?

434

Too many distractions.

435

I'll be at it all night.

You have bad work habits.

437
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:39,696
Not when I'm actually working.

438
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:45,137
I better get set up in the
kitchen.

439
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,232
It makes TV seem
very futuristic.

440
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:56,148
Because you're stoned.

441
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,541
I'm hardly stoned.

442
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:00,804

00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,508
Thank you.

Need help?

447
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:11,119
Yeah.

00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:15,341
Okay.

Where the hell's Nick?

460
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:10,700
Probably getting drunk
with the stock boys

461
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:13,051
is probably what he's doing.

He said the highway.

then your luck knows where to
find you.

00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:02,362
Yeah, I guess.

560
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:08,020
Hey, Beth?

561
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,152
Mm?

562
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:14,069
Leave it behind.

563
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:19,597
Leave what behind?

564
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,120
Unhappiness.

565
00:43:26,168 --> 00:43:29,911
-That was a bad answer.
-No, it's true.

566
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:31,260
It's not.

567
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,092
Come hold me.

568
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:39,007
What?

569
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,577
Come hold me
and you'll be happy.

570
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:50,149
Right.

571
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:55,154
And I'll find happiness
in your arms.

572
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:56,285
Yeah.

573
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:57,983
In you.

574
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:01,987
Yes.

575
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,119
That's bullshit.

576
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:06,252
I'm sorry, Sid,

577
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:09,864
but you have to find happiness
in yourself.

578
00:44:09,908 --> 00:44:11,387
No, that's wrong.

579
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:14,390
People tell you that,
but that's wrong.

580
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:15,914
It's not.

581
00:44:15,957 --> 00:44:18,394
It is. I know people
who have that--

582
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:22,529
that happiness from within,
and that--that happiness,

583
00:44:22,572 --> 00:44:25,358
that's just them being pleased
with themselves.

584
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:30,885
-It's not enough.
-No, you're being naive.

585
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:32,278
I mean, you've just been
stuck in this town,

586
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:33,714
you don't know.

587
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:37,718
I know that two people
can meet each other and...

588
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:42,244
like that, it's...it's like
they've never been alone.

589
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:44,943
-But that's not life.
-Who says?

590
00:44:44,986 --> 00:44:47,380
That's...We never met before
last night,

591
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:49,469
but we know each other.

592
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:52,254
I don't know you.

593
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:53,734
You know me.

594
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:55,780
No, I don't.

595
00:44:55,823 --> 00:44:57,477
Yes you do.

596
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,783
No.

597
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,265
I know you wanna fuck me.

598
00:45:05,006 --> 00:45:07,356
Is that what you know?

I'm looking for my parents.

My mother, my father, they
used--

Oh.

606
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:48,370
Hello.

607
00:46:48,414 --> 00:46:50,808
Hello.

608
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:53,593
This is my house.

609
00:46:53,636 --> 00:46:59,947
I mean...this is the house
I grew up in.

610
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:02,471
Well, this is his house now.

611
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:08,042
-All right, nice to meet you.
-And he's deaf.

612
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:10,915
-Nice to meet you!
-He's stone deaf.

613
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:13,308
-And yelling doesn't help?
-No.

614
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:14,788
Right.

615
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:22,535
My name's Nick, Nick Brown.

What's your name?

617
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:32,197
Elizabeth.

618
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,416
No.

619
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,765
Yes.

620
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:40,901
I know an Elizabeth.

621
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:43,295
Call her Beth.

I'd like to stay right here.

624

I have to be out tomorrow.

625
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:08,929
In this moment.

626
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:12,541
Enjoying this moment.

627
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:22,073
Moment's gone.

628
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:27,600
It can go on as long as we want.

629
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:37,784
Have you ever been
in a relationship?

630
00:48:37,827 --> 00:48:39,438
No.

631
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:42,832
I was married,

632
00:48:42,876 --> 00:48:45,835
but, uh, it wasn't really a
relationship.

633
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:47,141
You weren't married.

634
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:50,014
Yeah, two years right out of
high school.

635
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:56,716
Do I remind you of her?

636
00:48:56,759 --> 00:48:58,587
Oh, no.

637
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,676
Oh, thank God.

638
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:05,986
What happened?

639
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:10,077
She disappeared.

640
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:17,476
Was she ever found?

641
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:19,565
Not by me.

642
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:21,828
No, I didn't go look.

643
00:49:25,919 --> 00:49:29,227
She wanted to meet someone new

644
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,491
and I asked her why.

645
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:39,150
She said "Because he won't knowme from before, just now.

646
00:49:39,193 --> 00:49:43,806
Just--just what I am now."

647

But you can't escape who you are

no matter what, all those yearsare there.

649
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:58,430
She didn't understand that if
you leave

650
00:49:58,473 --> 00:50:01,868
they're still there in you.

651
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:04,479
But they stop being clear.

652
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:10,311
You stop knowing who you are andwhat you want.

653
00:50:15,664 --> 00:50:20,539
You stayed here, you know who
you are?

654
00:50:20,582 --> 00:50:25,587
I see the lawns I mow and the
houses I've painted,

655

friends I know, my parents.

656
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:30,679
I'm constantly reminded
who I am.

657
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,947
You know what you want?

658
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,126
I want you.

659
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:46,391
Oh.

660
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:51,700
I want to be inside you.

661
00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:57,793
Oh, good.

662
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:06,585
Come here and put it inside me.

663
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:13,200
No, I want to be able to put
myself inside of you.

664
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:20,816
Doing this is as close as you
get.

665
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,997
Come here.

00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:41,010

Come inside me.

672
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:25,359
When did he move here?

673
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:27,579
Do you know where the people
before him went?

674
00:52:27,622 --> 00:52:29,755
-No.
-You're sure?

675
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:33,759
Yes, he doesn't remember
anymore.

676
00:52:36,675 --> 00:52:40,722
So he can't help me.

677
00:52:40,766 --> 00:52:42,289
No.

678
00:52:56,521 --> 00:52:59,480
I lost my parents.

679
00:53:05,878 --> 00:53:09,360
Did you lose both of them at thesame time?

680
00:53:13,407 --> 00:53:15,061
Is that a joke?

681
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:18,804
No.

682
00:53:22,721 --> 00:53:24,201
Then, yes.

683
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:28,727
I lost them both at the same
time.

684
00:53:33,688 --> 00:53:37,257
I lost mine one at a time.

685
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:40,565
Last year.

686
00:53:40,608 --> 00:53:42,871
I'm sorry.

687
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:45,091
It's tragic.

688
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:49,008
They were six months apart.

it was delicious.

Yeah.

696
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:31,920
My mother and I would go to
visit him in the hospital

697
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:33,835
and--and he'd grab at us.

698
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:36,882
He'd just grab our arms
and hold on.

699
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:42,148
That's really--that's very sad.

700
00:54:44,716 --> 00:54:46,674
But I gotta be going.

701
00:54:50,635 --> 00:54:52,941

No.

be done.

Someone there can hook the phoneback up.

725

It's not like a phone guy came
to our house

726

to disconnect the phone.

somewhere.

Or plug--plugged something intoa computer

731

and the phone stopped working.

732
00:57:50,641 --> 00:57:52,991
They turned it off, they can
turn it back on.

I know.

I know it's the weekend.

I know, call them at home.

They'll have a computer at theirhouse.

They'll--they'll have

That's how these people live!

They'll be glad to do it.

I can't have the police go to myhouse.

That won't work.

00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:18,538
No, it's you, Janet,you have to be able to help me.

744
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:22,542
I gotta phone home, I can't
wait, it could be too late.

745
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:25,153
Janet, please.

746
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:27,112
You got--you gotta help me.

747
00:58:27,155 --> 00:58:30,332
Please, you can reconnect me.

748
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:32,552
Janet, don't hang up!

749
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:34,859
Don't hang up!

750
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:37,035
You fucker!

751
00:58:37,078 --> 00:58:39,385
You heartless fucker!

752
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,041
[choir singing]

753
01:00:18,223 --> 01:00:20,747
[muffled alarm clock]

754
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:39,157
Good morning.

755
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,639
Hi.

756
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:45,163
Hi.

757
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,473
I, um, didn't want to wake you.

758
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:55,216
Oh, I'm awake,
I'm a morning person.

759
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,740
Oh.

760
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:59,133
I'm not.

761
01:00:59,177 --> 01:01:01,222
Why don't you come back to bed?

762
01:01:03,181 --> 01:01:04,661
I can't.

763
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:09,448
Gotta pack.

764
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:12,277
Where do we start?

765
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,367
No, no, you paint.

766
01:01:17,238 --> 01:01:18,544
Okay.

767
01:01:21,895 --> 01:01:23,810
[wind chimes twinkling]

768
01:01:23,854 --> 01:01:25,551
Oh, God.

769
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:30,295
[fly buzzing]

770
01:01:30,338 --> 01:01:32,863
[motorcycle approaching]

771
01:01:52,621 --> 01:01:54,580
The phone work?

772
01:01:57,322 --> 01:01:59,324
No.

773
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:18,125
How was he?

774
01:02:18,169 --> 01:02:19,997
Young.

775
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:25,002
A little weak on tenderness
but long on juice?

776
01:02:26,307 --> 01:02:28,266
Long on conversation.

777
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:29,615
Mm.

778
01:02:31,269 --> 01:02:33,314
Did you need talk?

779
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,929
I guess I did.

780
01:02:38,972 --> 01:02:40,800
Good.

781
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:42,454
What are we doing?

782
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:46,850
Beth.

783
01:02:48,547 --> 01:02:51,550
I don't know. Shit.

784
01:02:54,422 --> 01:02:57,948
I mean, I was in Flagstaff
for two years

785
01:02:57,991 --> 01:02:59,297
before you guys got here.

786
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,864
I mean, I've been here for fiveyears.

787
01:03:00,907 --> 01:03:02,256
Yeah.

788
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,302
This state's driving me crazy.

789
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:06,260
What are you gonna do?

790
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:10,264
Well, I got no money.

791
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:12,005
I've got some.

792
01:03:17,663 --> 01:03:23,582
I can't take it, I mean,
you're being great but I--I...

793
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:25,018
I'm gonna be gone,

794
01:03:25,062 --> 01:03:27,238
we won't see each other again
and I won't send it.

795
01:03:27,281 --> 01:03:29,806
I won't, I'll forget or I'll
just never get around to it

796
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:32,983
or just--I don't know.

797
01:03:33,026 --> 01:03:36,029
Just...shit.

798
01:03:38,031 --> 01:03:40,686
I--I'm just gonna sell
all this shit,

799
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:43,515
but I don't want any of it.

800
01:03:43,558 --> 01:03:46,213
Just my car and my clothes.

801
01:03:46,257 --> 01:03:47,867
Okay.

802
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:53,481
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

803
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:55,788
just I shouldn't have fucked
this kid last night, you know.

804
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,225
I just--I should've slept.

805
01:03:58,269 --> 01:04:01,098
Now I've got all this stuff to
do today and I'm tired

806
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,926
and I'm all churned up,
I'm in a fucking mood.

807
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:05,754
Let's do things,
let's get you busy.

808
01:04:05,798 --> 01:04:08,235
Okay.

809
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:09,671
Uh.

810
01:04:09,715 --> 01:04:12,892
You get all the stuff that you
want to sell

811
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:16,896
and, uh, I'll make some yard
sale signs.

812
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,811
No one's gonna buy my shit.

813
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,465
It's all junk.

814
01:04:22,293 --> 01:04:25,252
That's what people buy at yard
sales.

815
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:30,867
[soft music]

816
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:03,029
Hi, is there something specificyou're looking for?

817
01:05:03,073 --> 01:05:04,857
Yes.

818
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,469
Actually, everything,
I don't have anything.

819
01:05:08,513 --> 01:05:10,036
Nothing?

820
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,473
I just moved to town.

821
01:05:12,517 --> 01:05:16,477
My husband passed away and Ididn't want to have our things.

822
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:18,479
They were too familiar.

823
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,397
You can have everything.

824
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:25,965
For?

825
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:29,751
Three hundred dollars,
all of this stuff.

826
01:05:29,795 --> 01:05:31,971
Everything, um,
stuff in the boxes

827
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:34,974
and there's a few more chairs
inside the house

828
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:39,674
and a table and a mattressand a couch but it's a sofa bed.

829
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:42,242
It folds out, it's very
comfortable.

830
01:05:42,286 --> 01:05:44,157
Oh, my, I don't know.

831
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:45,767
Everything?

832
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:47,508
Yeah, everything.

833
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:50,903
Except the TV,
the TV's not for sale.

834
01:06:06,658 --> 01:06:10,227
Maybe some nice turquoise
jewelry?

835
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:15,014
I don't think she really wears
jewelry.

836
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:18,409
How about a nice Diné rug?

837
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:22,326
What, as a present?
No.

838
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:26,069
What about that?
That will make her laugh.

839
01:06:26,112 --> 01:06:30,508
That's authentic,
it's very expensive.

840
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:33,990
You got something like that
but fake?

841
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:35,556
I'm sorry, what's your name?

842
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,733
Oh, um, could you just leave
the name part blank?

843
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:40,126
I won't have an account

844
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,085
and I'll have to find a place
to cash it for me.

845
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:43,956
You're all loaded up and ready
to roll.

846
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,436
You did all the work.

847
01:06:45,479 --> 01:06:47,090
Oh, we're a full service outfit.

848
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:48,569
I'd come and help you unload it

849
01:06:48,613 --> 01:06:49,918
except I've got
to finish painting.

850
01:06:49,962 --> 01:06:51,833
But, uh, my lovely assistant,
Carol,

851
01:06:51,877 --> 01:06:53,574
here would be happy to help.

852
01:06:53,618 --> 01:06:57,274
-Wouldn't you?
-Sure, sure,

853
01:06:57,317 --> 01:06:58,840
I'll follow you in my car.

854
01:06:58,884 --> 01:07:03,932
And I'll come by tomorrow with
my truck and the sofa bed.

855
01:07:03,976 --> 01:07:05,412
Oh, don't forget these.

856
01:07:05,456 --> 01:07:09,590
Oh, yeah, of course, thanks.

857
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:11,549
Thanks a lot.

858
01:07:11,592 --> 01:07:14,856
Oh, thank you,
you've given me a home.

859
01:07:16,554 --> 01:07:18,556
I'll be right along.

860
01:07:20,427 --> 01:07:22,995
That had to be history's most
efficient yard sale.

861
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,519
I know.

862
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:27,869
It's true.

863
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:30,698
I'm sorry that Sid stuck you
with the unloading.

864
01:07:30,742 --> 01:07:33,092
Oh, that.

865
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:34,441
[laughter]

866
01:07:34,485 --> 01:07:35,790
No problem.

867
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:41,492
He kind of bites my butt.

868
01:07:41,535 --> 01:07:44,451
But he's okay.

869
01:07:44,495 --> 01:07:46,366
Yeah, he is.

870
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:59,597
Oh, well, listen,

871
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,729
I'm probably gonna be gone
before you get back.

872
01:08:01,773 --> 01:08:04,471
You know, I was thinking that,
uh,

873
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:07,518
maybe we could be roomies,
you know?

874
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:08,867
Roomies.

875
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:12,871
Just until you figure out
what's next.

876
01:08:12,914 --> 01:08:14,916
Hm, hm.

877
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,831
Uh-uh-uh, I can't, I can't.

878
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:18,485
Why not?

879
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:21,706
'Cause if I don't go now I'll
just wind up staying with him

880
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:25,884
and he just--he gets to me too
much, you know.

881
01:08:25,927 --> 01:08:28,147
I can't.

882
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:30,106
You've done worse.

883
01:08:34,022 --> 01:08:36,373
We both have.

884
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:37,635
Mhm.

885
01:08:37,678 --> 01:08:38,984
[laughter]

886
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:54,913
Sid?

887
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:57,437
Hi.

888
01:08:57,481 --> 01:08:59,178
I'm sorry about the sofa bed.

889
01:08:59,222 --> 01:09:00,484
Oh, it's all right.

890
01:09:00,527 --> 01:09:02,181
I didn't really need one.

891
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:03,530
When my friends get drunk

892
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:07,665
they just throw up
and sleep on the floor.

893
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:10,058
But I gave it to you.

894
01:09:10,102 --> 01:09:12,887
Well, you--you gave me a lot
more.

895
01:09:15,716 --> 01:09:18,719
It's all even in this
department.

896
01:09:27,511 --> 01:09:30,383
Feel me.

897
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:32,255
Yeah.

898
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:34,213
You're hard again.

899
01:09:36,084 --> 01:09:38,652
I want you.

900
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:40,698
All the time.

901
01:09:44,267 --> 01:09:46,791
Oh, shit.

902
01:09:56,844 --> 01:09:59,543
Mm.

903
01:09:59,586 --> 01:10:02,198
I just fleeced a widow.

904
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:03,547
No, you didn't.

905
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:06,941
Yeah, I did, it was all junk.

906
01:10:10,989 --> 01:10:14,122
I gotta go, take a couple of
aspirin.

907
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,299
Funny, I didn't think I had
enough to drink

908
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:18,692
that I would have a hangover.

909
01:10:32,793 --> 01:10:35,709
You just feel bad for her
like I feel bad for her,

910
01:10:35,753 --> 01:10:38,190
'cause her husband died.

911
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,496
Yeah?

912
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:41,019
Yeah.

913
01:10:41,062 --> 01:10:45,153
That's about the saddest thing
there is.

914
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:47,591
Losing someone you love.

915
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,812
It's never happened to me.

916
01:10:53,379 --> 01:10:56,077
If you died...

917
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:58,645
I couldn't stand life.

918
01:11:15,053 --> 01:11:17,055
I have to go now.

919
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:18,883
New people are gonna be here.

920
01:11:18,926 --> 01:11:20,232
-Go to my house.
-No.

921
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,016
Just while you're looking for aplace.

922
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,322
No, I gotta go.

923
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:24,410
Really, there's a friend
of mine,

924
01:11:24,454 --> 01:11:25,803
I know she's got a place in
Agawam.

925
01:11:25,846 --> 01:11:28,327
No. Agawam? No.

926
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:31,025
No, I don't know where I'm gonnago, just somewhere else.

927
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:32,940
Well, you--you can call me whenyou get there.

928
01:11:32,984 --> 01:11:34,638
I'll give you my number.

929
01:11:34,681 --> 01:11:36,030
Sid.

930
01:11:36,074 --> 01:11:37,989
I'm going away, you're making meway too important.

931
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:39,947
You just met me yesterday.

932
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:41,819
And today I love you.

933
01:11:41,862 --> 01:11:43,821
Oh, Jesus, one day.

934
01:11:43,864 --> 01:11:47,259
That's not important, it doesn'tmatter if it's a day or a year.

935
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,652
It can happen in a second.

936
01:11:48,695 --> 01:11:51,350
No, that's a fucking animal
thing, I've done that.

937
01:11:51,394 --> 01:11:54,658
I meet men, I go home with them,and I just stay.

938
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:56,137
There's no decision involved,

939
01:11:56,181 --> 01:11:58,662
it's just like--
it's just what I do.

940
01:11:58,705 --> 01:12:00,054
That way I don't have
to lead my life,

941
01:12:00,098 --> 01:12:01,273
I can just lead theirs.

942
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,448
I can't keep doing that.

943
01:12:02,492 --> 01:12:03,928
-We're not that way.
-What way are we?

944
01:12:03,971 --> 01:12:05,582
We're passionate, we're
comfortable, we're--

945
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,888
It's been passionate,
it's been comfortable.

946
01:12:07,932 --> 01:12:10,848
But it hasn't been important
like you're making it.

947
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:12,850
It is important, you know that.

948
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:16,070
It was a night, it was fun,
it was some great fucking

949
01:12:16,114 --> 01:12:17,594
but it's just something that
happened.

950
01:12:17,637 --> 01:12:19,639
It's not just something that
happened, we're it.

951
01:12:19,683 --> 01:12:22,381
I'm the one for you.

952
01:12:22,425 --> 01:12:24,252
-The one?
-Yeah.

953
01:12:24,296 --> 01:12:27,386
I'm twenty-fucking-eight years
old, I've had lots of ones.

954
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:28,866
-You're just the latest.
-No.

955
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:32,609
I'm the last, you found me
and it can go on forever.

956
01:12:32,652 --> 01:12:35,655
Oh, oh, Sid.

957
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:37,265
Forever.

958
01:12:37,309 --> 01:12:39,311
You've gotta understand
it's just talk.

959
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,399
It's not.

960
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:42,270
It is, it is!

961
01:12:42,314 --> 01:12:44,098
I mean, come on, these things
you say?

962
01:12:44,142 --> 01:12:45,578
Come on, what,
that if I died

963
01:12:45,622 --> 01:12:47,014
you couldn't stand life,
that's--that's--that's--

964
01:12:47,058 --> 01:12:50,017
-What? That's true.-No, you won't know when I die.

965
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:51,018
You won't be there.

966
01:12:51,062 --> 01:12:52,672
You'd want me there.

967
01:12:52,716 --> 01:12:55,501
If I wasn't there it wouldn'tmatter who was, you'd be alone.

968
01:12:55,545 --> 01:12:56,981
No.

969
01:12:57,024 --> 01:12:58,417
Beth?

970
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:01,420
-Beth, you love me.
-No.

971
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:03,074
How--how do you feel?

972
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:04,292
Think.

973
01:13:04,336 --> 01:13:06,077
You love me.

974
01:13:08,558 --> 01:13:11,952
I care about you.

975
01:13:11,996 --> 01:13:14,172
You have to be with me.

976
01:13:14,215 --> 01:13:18,568
No, I care about youbut I'm an adult, I can say no.

977
01:13:19,917 --> 01:13:21,222
That's what makes you an adult?

978
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:22,789
Yes, I can say no.

979
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:26,358
No, I won't do that. No, I won'thave that. No, I can't.

980
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,925
You can say no to me?

981
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:29,579
Yes.

982
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:36,150
I'm going.

983
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:37,935
Beth.

984
01:13:37,978 --> 01:13:39,763
Have some place to go.

985
01:13:39,806 --> 01:13:41,678
I don't.

986
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:44,724
-Why don't you--
-Don't tell me what to do.

987
01:13:46,117 --> 01:13:48,424
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

988
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:54,734
[soft music]

989
01:14:41,433 --> 01:14:42,739
Beth!

990
01:14:45,045 --> 01:14:47,004
Beth?

991
01:14:47,047 --> 01:14:49,572
[paint cart rattling]

992
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:03,629
She's not here.

993
01:15:04,891 --> 01:15:06,589
Shit.

994
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:10,506
Excuse me.

995
01:15:12,116 --> 01:15:14,074
Shit.

996
01:15:17,904 --> 01:15:19,471
Who are you?

997
01:15:21,212 --> 01:15:23,257
Painter.

998
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:29,089
You're Nick.

999
01:15:29,133 --> 01:15:30,482
Yeah.

1000
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,484
The Indian Chief.

1001
01:15:33,746 --> 01:15:35,313
Shit.

1002
01:15:35,356 --> 01:15:36,923
You're too late.

1003
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:38,490
She's gone.

1004
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,057
I got that, where'd she go?

1005
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,102
She didn't say.

1006
01:16:04,603 --> 01:16:06,387
Shit!

1007
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:21,185
This really bothers me.

1008
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,057
Do me a favor?

1009
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:25,319
What?

1010
01:16:25,363 --> 01:16:27,191
Act normal.

1011
01:16:28,671 --> 01:16:31,064
This is my house.

1012
01:16:31,108 --> 01:16:33,066
You're in my house

1013
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:36,679
and I'm tired of there
being strangers in my house.

1014
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:39,072
This is not your house,
you're gone.

1015
01:16:39,116 --> 01:16:43,337
I'm painting for the new peoplewhose house this is going to be.

1016
01:16:43,381 --> 01:16:48,429
You're gone, they're not here
yet, I'm here.

1017
01:16:48,473 --> 01:16:50,997
Well, I guess that makes this
my house.

1018
01:16:55,306 --> 01:16:57,221
Mind if I look around?

1019
01:16:57,264 --> 01:17:00,180
Sure, make yourself at home.

1020
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,643
Aw.

1021
01:17:30,297 --> 01:17:31,864
No.

1022
01:17:34,475 --> 01:17:36,260
She left the TV.

1023
01:17:36,303 --> 01:17:39,219
Yup, she didn't seem to want it.

1024
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:57,150
You're back.

1025
01:17:57,194 --> 01:17:58,630
Yeah.

1026
01:18:02,373 --> 01:18:04,331
Is Beth here?

1027
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:07,857
No, you know where she went?

1028
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,423
No.

1029
01:18:09,467 --> 01:18:10,773
Shit.

1030
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:13,384
-You're too late.
-She's gone.

1031
01:18:16,169 --> 01:18:18,084
Who is this guy?

1032
01:18:18,128 --> 01:18:20,696
Beth's new boyfriend.

1033
01:18:22,915 --> 01:18:24,438
What?

1034
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,181
Is this true?

1035
01:18:28,225 --> 01:18:30,967
Not really.

1036
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:32,838
Not really?

1037
01:18:36,407 --> 01:18:39,105
Not really!

1038
01:18:39,149 --> 01:18:41,238
What?

1039
01:18:43,022 --> 01:18:46,156
Did you fuck her?

1040
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:47,984
I don't tell.

1041
01:18:51,335 --> 01:18:53,467
Jesus.

1042
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,299
The next day.

1043
01:19:02,259 --> 01:19:04,478
Well, that's the world, huh?

1044
01:19:04,522 --> 01:19:06,524
Won't even wait a day anymore.

1045
01:19:06,567 --> 01:19:08,787
-You left her.
-Yeah, I didn't fuck anyone.

1046
01:19:08,831 --> 01:19:11,224
You didn't find anyone.

1047
01:19:11,268 --> 01:19:13,444
No, I didn't leave her for
another person,

1048
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:15,098
I left her for another place.

1049
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:18,057
Which I think is a little more
excusable!

1050
01:19:18,101 --> 01:19:19,493
I don't!

1051
01:19:21,104 --> 01:19:23,280
Well, this is none of your
fucking business.

1052
01:19:23,323 --> 01:19:25,412
-I think it is.
-Why?

1053
01:19:25,456 --> 01:19:27,023
'Cause you fucked her?

1054
01:19:27,066 --> 01:19:29,416
No, that gives you no business
in my life.

1055
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,592
Leave him alone.

1056
01:19:34,508 --> 01:19:36,380
-Why?
-He was nice to Beth

1057
01:19:36,423 --> 01:19:39,209
when you treated her like shit.

1058
01:19:39,252 --> 01:19:40,558
No.

1059
01:19:40,601 --> 01:19:44,127
No, she was vulnerable
and he fucked her!

1060
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:46,172
I loved her.

1061
01:19:46,216 --> 01:19:47,304
Yeah, right!

1062
01:19:47,347 --> 01:19:50,220
-He was there for her.
-And I wasn't?

1063
01:19:50,263 --> 01:19:52,135
You were halfway to Butte!

1064
01:19:52,178 --> 01:19:54,441
Yeah, but when I was here I wasthere for her.

1065
01:19:54,485 --> 01:19:58,445
Nick, you were never really
here.

1066
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:00,012
Is that what you think?

1067
01:20:00,056 --> 01:20:03,102
I'm just telling you thatthey were good with each other.

1068
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:09,456
And I brought them together.

1069
01:20:11,502 --> 01:20:15,767
It seems I'm blessed
in what I do.

1070
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:20,903
I do wrong, it turns out right
that I've done right,

1071
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:23,731
so it doesn't really matter
what I do.

1072
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:26,169
No, no, because
if you hadn't left

1073
01:20:26,212 --> 01:20:27,910
I wouldn't have been with Beth.

1074
01:20:27,953 --> 01:20:29,912
I'd be done painting,
I'd be home.

1075
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:32,305
Oh, be glad you have a home,
asshole.

1076
01:20:32,349 --> 01:20:34,351
Nick!

1077
01:20:34,394 --> 01:20:39,443
If you were such the happy
couple why isn't she here?

1078
01:20:39,486 --> 01:20:42,315
Because after three years with
you she wanted to be alone.

1079
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:45,318
And why wouldn't you go be alonewith her?

1080
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:48,887
It wasn't offered.

1081
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:51,411
People aren't gonna offer you
anything.

1082
01:20:51,455 --> 01:20:52,804
You gotta take what you want.

1083
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,632
Well, you can't take
another person.

1084
01:20:54,675 --> 01:20:56,460
They've got to give themselves
to you.

1085
01:20:56,503 --> 01:20:58,636
Oh, that's very wise.

1086
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:02,292
But not very true.

1087
01:21:02,335 --> 01:21:05,382
I sell TVs, people don't know
what they want.

1088
01:21:05,425 --> 01:21:07,340
I have to show them.

1089
01:21:07,384 --> 01:21:10,126
Well, I--I couldn't.

1090
01:21:10,169 --> 01:21:12,258
That's too bad.

1091
01:21:15,566 --> 01:21:20,353
'Cause that's why she left.

1092
01:21:20,397 --> 01:21:24,488
To maybe be closer
to what she wants.

1093
01:21:24,531 --> 01:21:27,447
And what is that?

1094
01:21:27,491 --> 01:21:29,885
How the hell would I know?

1095
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:32,931
What do I know?
What the fuck do I know!

1096
01:21:32,975 --> 01:21:35,847
I know that what I want isn't
out there!

1097
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:39,024
It isn't in here, it isn't
inside, it isn't outside!

1098
01:21:39,068 --> 01:21:41,505
It doesn't exist
but he wants her!

1099
01:21:41,548 --> 01:21:44,377
And he isn't doing shit
about it!

1100
01:21:54,213 --> 01:21:57,956
I--I--I can go after her.

1101
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,611
Yes, you can.

1102
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:10,664
Fuck.

1103
01:22:12,536 --> 01:22:15,060
Oh, Sid, where are you gonna
look?

1104
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:18,759
I don't know.

1105
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:24,243
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1106
01:22:24,287 --> 01:22:26,854
You've just fucked up another
person's life.

1107
01:22:26,898 --> 01:22:29,683
-No.
-He's not gonna find her.

1108
01:22:29,727 --> 01:22:33,687
-He might.
-It's a big planet, asshole!

1109
01:22:36,255 --> 01:22:38,866
[engine revs]

1110
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:40,738
Shit!

1111
01:22:45,612 --> 01:22:47,397
-She'll head for her parents.
-What?

1112
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:51,401
She'll head for her parents,
they're in Florida.

1113
01:22:51,444 --> 01:22:53,577
Take Route 10, keep going east.

1114
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:56,449
And around 11, start checking
every roadside motel.

1115
01:22:56,493 --> 01:22:58,321
The budget ones, if you do thatyou'll find her.

1116
01:22:58,364 --> 01:22:59,975
How do you know she's on the
highway?

1117
01:23:00,018 --> 01:23:01,802
When you don't know
where you're going,

1118
01:23:01,846 --> 01:23:03,979
you drive on the highway.

1119
01:23:11,595 --> 01:23:14,554
I didn't finish painting.

1120
01:23:14,598 --> 01:23:16,556
I'll finish.

1121
01:23:26,523 --> 01:23:27,828
[tires screech]

1122
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:25,016
Nick?

1123
01:24:26,452 --> 01:24:27,932
Yeah?

1124
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:33,068
What you've been doing you can'tdo anymore.

1125
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,074
I understand.

1126
01:24:57,179 --> 01:24:59,529
It's not that you can't do it.

1127
01:25:03,533 --> 01:25:08,103
It's--it's that I don't want youto do it.

1128
01:25:11,715 --> 01:25:13,586
Anymore.

1129
01:25:17,895 --> 01:25:19,897
Okay.

1130
01:25:27,687 --> 01:25:29,689
Nick.

1131
01:25:29,733 --> 01:25:31,648
I've stopped.

1132
01:25:59,719 --> 01:26:04,115
I went to my parents' house.

1133
01:26:07,249 --> 01:26:09,773
Like you said to.

1134
01:26:13,864 --> 01:26:15,474
And?

1135
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:21,393
There was this...

1136
01:26:21,437 --> 01:26:23,482
ancient man.

1137
01:26:25,049 --> 01:26:30,881
This giant man in the doorway...

1138
01:26:32,752 --> 01:26:38,410
...and I thought,
"That's my father.

1139
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:44,024
My, how he's aged."

1140
01:26:48,681 --> 01:26:51,945
He was very tall.

1141
01:26:51,989 --> 01:26:57,647
He was too tall to be my father.

1142
01:26:57,690 --> 01:27:03,261
And he was wearing a long, longrobe and I thought...

1143
01:27:03,305 --> 01:27:09,659
it's a trick, he's sitting on
my mother's shoulders.

1144
01:27:13,706 --> 01:27:20,147
And then out from behind himcame this beautiful, young girl.

1145
01:27:20,191 --> 01:27:21,888
[soft music]

1146
01:27:21,932 --> 01:27:24,804
Beth.

1147
01:27:24,848 --> 01:27:27,154
Yeah, Beth.

1148
01:27:27,198 --> 01:27:29,026
And...

1149
01:27:32,334 --> 01:27:34,771
...they sang to me.

1150
01:27:48,306 --> 01:27:51,744
London bridge is falling down

1151
01:27:51,788 --> 01:27:55,313
Falling down, falling down

1152
01:28:04,888 --> 01:28:10,633
London bridge is falling down,

1153
01:28:10,676 --> 01:28:14,027
my fair lady

1154
01:28:20,643 --> 01:28:22,993
It was very touching.

1155
01:28:26,997 --> 01:28:28,172
I'm sure.

1156
01:28:31,175 --> 01:28:33,917
It was.

1157
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,833
It was very touching.

1158
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,279
Shit.

1159
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:56,766
I hate talking to you.

1160
01:28:56,809 --> 01:28:59,334
[soft, bright music]

1161
01:31:11,422 --> 01:31:13,946
[choir singing]
