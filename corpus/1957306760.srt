710

719

is a racist message.

732
01:00:05,344 --> 01:00:07,604
- Who's innocent?
- Oscar Grant was innocent.

733
01:00:07,673 --> 01:00:08,672
Oscar Grant had a record,

734
01:00:08,741 --> 01:00:09,873
illegal possession
of a handgun.

735
01:00:09,942 --> 01:00:11,441
Don't tell me
these people are innocent.

736
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:14,380
He was shot in the back lying
facedown on a subway platform.

737
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:17,086
- It was a freak accident.
- Except it keeps happening.

738
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,450
Trayvon Martin was also
a freak accident?

739
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:19,885
Trayvon Martin
wasn't killed by a cop.

740
01:00:19,954 --> 01:00:23,191
- He was killed by an idiot.
- Tamir Rice, Eric Garner...

741
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,259
Eric Garner is dead
because he was selling

742
01:00:24,328 --> 01:00:26,722
untaxed cigarettes
and resisting arrest.

743
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:28,262
The guy was the size
of a Mack truck.

744
01:00:28,331 --> 01:00:30,165
It took five cops
to restrain him.

745
01:00:30,234 --> 01:00:31,467
How could anyone know
that he had asthma?

746
01:00:31,535 --> 01:00:34,070
Because he was screaming,
"I can't breathe."

747
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:35,438
See,
even the marketing there,

748
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:38,173
the "I can't breathe" shirts,
it's just so accusatory,

749
01:00:38,242 --> 01:00:39,374
pointing a finger at me

750
01:00:39,443 --> 01:00:41,077
as if I was the one
who was choking him.

751
01:00:41,146 --> 01:00:42,045
- You keep...
- Down.

753
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:45,680
Well, because it is marketing

754
01:00:45,749 --> 01:00:48,546
that is driving the culture
wars in this country, Gabe.

755
01:00:48,615 --> 01:00:50,746
We created the conditions
in these neighborhoods,

756
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,114
and then we send cops to them,

757
01:00:52,183 --> 01:00:53,249
and you sit here and defend
them when they kill a kid

758
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:54,617
that could just as well
have been yours,

759
01:00:54,686 --> 01:00:56,925
and that makes you complicit,
so yes, yes, David,

760
01:00:56,994 --> 01:00:58,126
the marketing is pointing
a finger at you.

761
01:00:58,195 --> 01:01:01,361
Okay, we didn't create
these conditions, Gabe.

762
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:04,562
We're Jewish.
We came from ghettos, too.

763
01:01:04,631 --> 01:01:06,465
Jews enjoy the privileges
of being white.

764

Only in New York.

765
01:01:08,002 --> 01:01:10,271
What's happening is that
people like you and the media

766
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,603
are using people like
Eric Garner,

767
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:14,869
isolated incidents,
to justify your agenda.

768
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:17,146
Freddie Gray
was an isolated incident?

769
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,774
Mike Brown was
an isolated incident?

770
01:01:18,843 --> 01:01:20,042
Freddie Gray had a knife.

771
01:01:20,111 --> 01:01:23,812
Mike Brown was fighting a cop
over control of a gun.

772
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:25,583
If you do that,
you might get shot.

773
01:01:25,652 --> 01:01:29,125
12 times?
Unarmed kid shot 12 times?

774
01:01:29,194 --> 01:01:30,588
- Okay, relax.
- Don't tell me to relax.

775
01:01:30,657 --> 01:01:32,128
I just don't think that
you're appreciating

776
01:01:32,197 --> 01:01:33,496
how difficult it is
to be a policeman

777
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:35,296
- in these neighborhoods.
- Try being Black in them.

778
01:01:35,365 --> 01:01:36,627
Because you would know.

779
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:38,266
We know what it's like to be

780
01:01:38,335 --> 01:01:39,630
part of a persecuted minority.

781
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:41,401
Yes, which is exactly why

782
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:43,469
we, of all people,
should understand.

783
01:01:43,538 --> 01:01:46,703
Gabe, we picked ourselves up
as a people

784
01:01:46,772 --> 01:01:47,938
because of strong family values

785
01:01:48,007 --> 01:01:49,871
and a culture
that prioritizes education,

786
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,873
not because we said
our lives matter.

787
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,281
When these kids are
playing basketball,

788
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:54,382
my kid is doing his homework.

789
01:01:54,451 --> 01:01:56,680
Okay, I don't even...
That's just racist.

790
01:01:56,749 --> 01:01:59,353
- Oh, my God, racist, really?
- Racist... that's not racist.

791

First of all, there's nothing
wrong with playing basketball.

and there's my history.

796

797
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:11,293
Kid born in
a poor neighborhood

798

is less likely to go to college

799
01:02:14,305 --> 01:02:16,436

in jail or shot by a cop

800
01:02:16,505 --> 01:02:17,899

in this neighborhood.

801

The Black people
who work for me,

802
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,335
they would be so annoyed
by this argument.

803
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:23,542
They're more likely to end up
in jail or shot by a cop

804
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:25,841
than a kid born
in this neighborhood,

805
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,009
than a kid born in this house.

806
01:02:27,078 --> 01:02:28,580

with your family values.
