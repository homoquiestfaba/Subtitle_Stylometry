00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,207
She'd be great.
I mean, really, she's brilliant.

152
00:09:57,277 --> 00:10:00,542
- She possess the necessary fire.
For the part, she'd be great.
- You really think so?

153
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:03,309
- I'm glad you think so.
- Think we can get her?

154
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:07,285
- I sent the script
to her agent, Sidney Loomis.
- You did?

155
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:10,982
- Did I do wrong? Did I do wrong?
- No, no.

156
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:13,685
- Did I do wrong not checking
with you first?
- Not at all.

157
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,623
- If so, I stand corrected. I mean that.
- No, really.

158
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:20,360
- Helen Sinclair... really.
- Get it out.

159
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:23,994
- She's great.
- Well, all we can do
is hope for the best.

160
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,164
You must be joking!

161
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,234
You want me to play some frumpy
housewife who gets dumped for a flapper?

162
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:36,442
Don't you remember who I am?
Don't you know who you represent?

163
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:40,475
- I'm Helen Sinclair!
- Definitely! You are
definitely Helen Sinclair.

164
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:45,217
I look at you and I say Helen Sinclair!
But who better to play that role?

165
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,055
- Under whose direction? Some novice!
- He's the author.

166
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:51,722
- Of two flops.
- Julian says it was the directors
that messed up those projects.

167
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:57,494
Julian Marx! I do plays put on
by Belasco or Sam Harris.

168
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,006
Not some Yiddish pants salesman
turned producer.

169
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:05,340
My ex-husband used to say,
"lf you're gonna go down,
go down with the best of them."

170
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:09,108
- Which ex-husband?
- Oh, I don't know which ex-husband.
The one with the moustache.

171
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:12,481
Listen to me. Authors are very often
the best directors of their own works.

172
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:15,680
She's dowdy! Sid, the ingenue
has all the hot lines.

173
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:18,349
Even the female psychiatrist
is a better role.

174
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:21,393
But the role of Sylvia Poston
is the lead.

175
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:26,330
Sylvia Poston.
Even the name reeks of Orbach's!

176
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:30,063
I do Electra!
I do Lady Macbeth!

177
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:35,403
I do plays by Noel and Phil Barry
or at least Max Anderson.

178
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:40,105
Helen, listen to me. This is
a major part in a serious play.

179
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:43,671
And let's face it, Helen. You have
not been in a hit in a long time.

180
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:47,743
- In a long, long, long time.
- I'm still a star!

181
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:52,123
I never play
frumps or virgins.

182
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,557
You're a star because you're great,
and you are a great star.

183
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,562
- But let me tell you somethin'.
- [ Bell Rings ]

184
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:58,564
In the last couple of years...

185
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:01,294
you're better known as an adulteress and
a drunk-- I say this in all due respect.

186
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,733
I haven't had a drink
since New Year's Eve.

187
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,738
- We're talkin' Chinese New Year's.
- Naturally.

188
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:08,366
Still, that's two days, Sid.
You know how long that is for me?

189
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:11,001
- What is it, Josette?
- [ Woman ] Some flowers.

190
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:13,045
Well, bring them here,
will you?

191
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,276
The offers are not pourin' in
like they used to.

192
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:18,783
They're from David Shayne.

193
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:22,647
"As a small artist to a greater one.
That you merely consider my play...

194
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:26,214
is all the fulfillment
I require.

195
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:28,227
Hmm.

196
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:35,066
- What's he like?
- I hear he's terrific.
A genius ready to emerge.

197
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:38,399
- I have to be billed over the title.
- Where else?

198
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:43,033
- Approval of the leading man.
The star's dressing room.
- This is not even a question.

199
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:45,509
Approval of
all photos of me.

200
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:48,103
Oh, it's still not
a very glamorous role.

201
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:52,049
But maybe I could meet with David.
Maybe we could go over the script.

202
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:56,077
Maybe there's a few ways
we could find to brighten her up. Hmm?

203
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:58,215
Why am I nervous?

204
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:03,428
- That was sad. Clara Bow had it rough.
- She's a doll.

205
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:07,422
- I'd do anything to be in a movie.
- You're pretty enough.

206
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,867
Do you think you could
ever speak to Mr. Valenti?

207
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:13,664
- Mr. Valenti knows everybody.
He'll do the right thing.
- That's right.

208
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:17,334
I hear he's gonna make Olive Neal
a Broadway star. [ Screams ]

209
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,244
[ Gunshots ]

210
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:27,279
Go, go, go!

211
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:29,719
Where'd it happen?

212
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:33,281
Who'd they get?
Oh, Jesus!

213
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:36,523
All right, I'm gonna be
at Olive's for about an hour.

214
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:39,827
You get some more guys downstairs
and call me back on the Masucci thing.

215
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,096
-This is for Leo Kustabeck, you hear me?
-[ Olive ] Hey!

216
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:47,105
- You said this was the lead.
It's a smaller part.
- All right.

217
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:49,801
- I got no time now.
- It's a smaller part.
I don't believe it.

218
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:52,811
- They just got Vinny and Sal
outside a movie house.
- I counted the lines.

219
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:56,713
- Sylvia Poston is the lead.
I'm just backing her up.
- You hear what I said?

220
00:13:56,782 --> 00:14:01,310
- I'm tired of backing people up.
I wanna be the lead.
- Julian says you're a doctor.

221
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:05,154
- A doctor. I don't wanna be
a doctor. I wanna be the lead.
- A head doctor. It's a big part.

222
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:07,853
A head doctor,
but it ain't the lead.

223
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,556
- So don't try and snow me.
- You'd squawk if they
hung you with a new rope.

224
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,622
- I know a lead when I see a lead,
and this ain't the lead.
- [ Phone Ringing ]

A lead has lots of scenes.
- Hello? Oh, Vito.

00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:22,204
- Ya heard? Get everybody
together at the garage.
- I don't get to kiss nobody.

- No, I want it done today!
What is it with you?
- Hey!

- You wanna take your business
outta here? We got guests!
- Call me back.

- I got trouble here.
- I don't care about your trouble.

Just foot the bills around here?
- I don't care.

this Broadway big shot too.
- Okay, just don't embarrass me.

- What?

needs charm lessons.

- I am a great actress.

- Hey, Dave, she read your play.
She thinks it's great.
- Yes, I read your play.

Charmed, charmed,

- Olive. Olive. Olive.

- Call me Olive, honey.
- You smoke?
- No.

- Olive, ah, your--
well, your experience?
- I love the play.

- Well, l, uh--
- Oh, she ain't got no experience.

- I do too. I have too.
- She's a natural.

- I have experience.
- They ain't talkin' dancin', Olive.

- He doesn't know
what he's talkin' about.
- You don't mean dancin', do you?

00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:42,683
She used to wiggle at this joint
in Hoboken. Pick up quarters

- I'll have a double anything. Be great.

- Venus, a double whiskey.

- Make it two, Venus.
- Do you want the blue
stuff or the green?

- The imported, dummy.
- Oh, you mean from the clean bathtub.

Mm-hmm.

- So you never acted before?
- Honey, honey. Yes, I have acted.

Geez. No manners.
No gentleman.

- Two numbers. Two thrilling,
show-stopping numbers.

I'm actually feeling
a little sick, really.

266
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:31,369
I'm actually feeling a little faint.
Can we sit down?

00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:37,342
So, one thing I was wonderin'
is who's gonna be playing
the part of Sylvia Poston?

268
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,708
[ Chuckles ]
Only Helen Sinclair.

269
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:43,977
Helen Sinclair? [ Laughs ]
I never heard of her.

270
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:48,646
- Uh, you follow the theater?
- What are you trying to insinuate?

271
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:50,655
Hey, don't
gimme that shit!

272
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:55,422
You tell Masucci he don't play
ball, I'll come down there,
I'll chop his fuckin' legs off!

273
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:59,055
Don't you pay any attention to Nick.
He's in one of his depressed moods.

274
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:03,496
I'll cut his throat. I'll come
down there, I'll pull his guts
out through his windpipe!

00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:05,696
- Ya hear me?
- What'd ya do? Walk up?

- No!
- You're sweating like a pig.

277
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:11,834
- I have a bit of a blood sugar
situation now and again.
- Blood sugar?

278
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:15,608
- What is that?
- Olive, you-- you like the play?

279
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:19,378
- Mmm. It's sad.
- Well, it's a tragedy.

280
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:23,445
I'll say, but I got some ideas
how we can goose it up.

281
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:26,116
- Ideas?
- Mm-hmm. I go to
the movies all the time.

- I got a million clever ideas.
- You burn it down, Cheech!
Burn it down, I said.

00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,831
- I want it to look like arson!
- I got a crick.

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,765
- When?
- A crick?

285

Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go.

Hey, Venus, let's go
with that hooch!

Uh, uh, Olive, when did you
get interested in acting?

Hey, listen, you think
I came to this town to swing
it around in a chorus line?

Tits and ass. Tits and ass.
That's all they care about. Thank you.

Hey, didn't I tell you
to make "horse durves"?

292
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:05,796
I don't make nothin' out of horses,
especially "horse durves..."

293
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:08,493
'cause I don't know what
they are, and neither do you!

294
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:12,628
Oh, ain't you the big mouth
since you hit your number.

295
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:17,938
- And I said the imported stuff.
- The imported stuff ate through
the bottle. It's gone !

296
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,070
A likely story. It's very hard
to get good help these days.

297
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:24,014
- Sorry you guys had to hear that.
- I'm feeling fairly dizzy.

298
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:28,884
- Some problems with the firm.
- Really? What type of firm is it, Nick?

299
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:32,754
- [ Chuckles ]
- It's a "don't stick your nose in
other people's business...

300
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,590
- and it won't get broken type of firm.
- Yeah.

301
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:38,893
- [ Panting ] I see, I see. Thank you.
- That's what kind of firm.

302
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:42,127
I'm feeling a bit unstable.
I think maybe I'll go...

303
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:45,693
and check into a sanitarium
and get the help that I need.

304
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:49,571
- And we'll talk later because
it's been good. Hasn't it, Julian?
- Yeah.

305
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:51,576
- Oh, yeah.
- It's been good.

306
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:54,909
- This is gonna be
a big event on Broadway.
- Thank you.

307
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,881
Absolutely not!
No!

308
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,976
- You'll work with her, mold her.
It'll be a challenge.
- Out of the question!

309
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:04,113
She'll win an award. It'll be a great
show business anecdote.

310
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,490
- It will not happen!
- A tribute to you as a director.
You use your actors like clay.

311
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:11,223
Julian, have you lost
all reason?

312
00:19:11,464 --> 00:19:15,662
Do you believe that that woman
could play a psychiatrist?
That woman? That thing?

313
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:17,668
- Her voice, her grasp.
- All right.

314
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:22,639
- She's the woman who picks
quarters off tabletops with--
- Let me level with you.

315
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,610
This is a dog-eat-dog world,
not an ideal world.

316
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:28,647
If you wanna get your play on, you're
gonna have to make a few concessions.

317
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:31,774
Life is not perfect.
Plus, it is short.

318
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:36,220
If you can't figure that out,
you might as well pack up right
now and go back to Pittsburgh.

319
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:45,596
- [ David Screaming ]
I sold out! I sold out.
- [ Ellen Gasping ]

320
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:47,859
- I sold out.
- David.

321
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:51,198
[ Panting ]

322
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,864
- [ Gasps ]
- What's wrong?

323
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:55,998
- [ Screaming ] I'm a whore!
- Oh, my God!

324
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:59,169
- I'm a prostitute! I'm a whore!
- David, pull yourself together.

325
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:00,906
- They'll call the police.
- [ Panting ]

326
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,540
David. Oh, my God!
You look horrible.

327
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:05,277
Oh, I feel sick.

328
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:09,887
Please, you'll wake the Finkelsteins.
You want an aspirin?

329
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:14,085
- David. David.
- Oh, my God! My art! My work!

330
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,060
- What's wrong with you?
- Do I want success that badly?

331
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:21,156
- David. Come back to bed.
- The answer's yes. The answer's yes.

332
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:25,294
- Please come back to bed.
- When offered to have my play
backed by a hoodlum, I said yes.

333
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:29,201
- Please come back to bed.
- It's a deal with the devil,
and the penalty is...

334
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:33,177
- his girlfriend plays a part.
- Who are you calling at 3:00 a.m.?

335
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:37,079
[ David ] Hello, Julian? It's David.
Who do you see in the male lead?

336
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:39,811
Oh, kid.

337
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,046
[ Groans ]
It's 3:00 a.m.

338
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:45,284
- I see Warner Purcell.
- Nah, too fat.

339
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:49,893
You seen him lately?
Nah, the man's a compulsive eater.

340
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:51,896
Doesn't matter.
I talked to his agent...

341
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:53,899
and he's been on a new diet
for four months. He looks fine.

342
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,663
I want him for Lieutenant Masters.
Then maybe I can live with all this.

343
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:58,794
I can live with
these compromises.

344
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:03,001
I'll have Warner Purcell
and Helen Sinclair, and then
I can live with that gun moll!

345
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:05,942
No, not Warner, kid. No.

346
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:08,310
I had him in Nuns Aplenty.

347
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:12,779
He'll turn over a new leaf. Then he'll
get insecure; he'll start eating.

348
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:17,049
By the time we get to Boston, he'll be
as big as my sister-in-law's ass.

349
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:21,252
No! No more compromises!
It is my play, and I want him!

350
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:24,956
I want him, and I want him,
and that's it. I'm not a whore!

351
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,193
- David, David, David!
- [ Sighs ] I'm all right.

352
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:31,896
[ Nick ] Olive starts rehearsal
for a show next week.

353
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:34,098
- I want you to stay with her.
- [ Cheech ] Yeah.

354
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:37,131
I want you to make sure
they treat her right up there.

355
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:40,076
Those theater characters
I don't trust 'em.

356
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:44,138
The show's costing me a bundle,
and I'm gonna get my money's worth.

357
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:47,185
- She wants to be a star.
- Yeah. Yeah.

358
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:50,244
- And I promised her.
- Mr. V., look, it's not
that I don't wanna do it--

359
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:54,692
Cheech, I'm giving you
an order. What do you do?

360
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,785
I know.

361
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:58,989
[ David ]
Monday, September 10.

362
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:02,591
Today rehearsals began,
and I've decided to keep a journal.

363
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:05,296
Perhaps my experience
will be of value to others...

364
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:09,671
just as I pore over with relish
the notes of my idols:
Chekov and Strindberg.

365
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:13,007
Rehearsals began promptly
at 10:00 a.m.

366
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:16,946
Warner Purcell was first to arrive
full of bonhomie and good humor.

367
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:20,816
- Good morning!
- Warner Purcell.
Hello, I'm David Shayne.

368
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:23,753
- Oh, David, how marvelous
to meet you. Well done.
- Thank you.

369
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:26,882
- It's a wonderful play.
Some lovely speeches.
- I'm honored you're doing it.

370
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,984
- It's my pleasure.
- Our stage manager, Mitch.

371
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:31,791
- Mitchell Sabine.
I'm here if you need anything.
- Mitchell, nice to meet you.

372
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:34,059
- That's fine.
- And you're gonna be
in dressing room two.

373
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:36,294
- Lovely.
- And this is my assistant, Lorna.

374
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:38,996
- Pleased to meet you.
- Lorna, nice to meet you.

375
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:42,165
We have coffee and Danish,
some smoked salmon.

376
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:46,439
Um, Mitchell, would it be
frightfully tiresome if I just
had hot water and lemon?

377
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,670
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

378
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:51,238
- And of course you know Julian Marx.
- Oh, Julian, yes.

379
00:22:51,316 --> 00:22:53,841
- Our swords have crossed.
- Warner, you look wonderful.

380
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:56,013
- And yourself.
- [ Woman Giggling ]

381
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:59,057
[ David ] Eden Brent, who plays
the other woman, arrived second.

382
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:01,150
She has
a wonderful vivacity.

383
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:05,026
[ Giggles ] Good morning! Good morning!
Don't get up. Don't get up.

384
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:08,227
- I have first-day-rehearsal
presents for everybody.
- How thoughtful.

385
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:13,102
It's nothing. Just some soap and some
potpourri and incense for you, I think.

386
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:16,335
- Now, have you met Mr. Woofles?
- No. No.

387
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:19,775
- Oh, don't pull such a sour face.
- Hello, Mr. Woofles.

388
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:21,779
Oh, be careful.
She's a Chihuahua...

389
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:25,908
but there's a pinch of Doberman in her
so sometimes she goes for your throat.

390
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:28,111
- Just kidding.
- [ Laughs ]

391
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:31,782
- I think you've met
everyone here. Lorna.
- We talked on the telephone.

392
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:34,690
I don't know if you've met
our Lieutenant Masters, Warner Purcell.

393
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,160
- Oh, pleased to meet you.
- How was your crossing?

394
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:40,926
- Well, I came over
five years ago, but it was lovely.
- [ Giggles ]

395
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,059
Now, my darling, do you want
some milk or something to eat?

396
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:48,266
- I'll get her a saucer.
- You don't have to bother with
that because I breast-feed her.

397
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,037
- Just kidding, everybody.
- [ Laughing ]

398
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,306
- Please.
- Julian, nice to see you.

399
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:56,813
- How are you?
- Mr. Marx.
- Yes, of course.

400
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:59,510
I'm in the middle, yes?

401
00:23:59,752 --> 00:24:02,414
- [ David ] Should we take the dog--
- No, no, no, no, no.

402
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:05,286
It's my baby.
[ Giggles ]

403
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:09,293
[ David ] Olive Neal entered, naturally,
with the force of a hurricane.

404
00:24:09,328 --> 00:24:13,731
- Hey, you gonna hover
over me like dead meat?
- Mr. V. says I stay close.

405
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,733
We've been drivin'
around for 15 minutes.

406
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:19,532
I told ya he said the Belasco,
not the Morosco, you cementhead!

407
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:21,137
- Hello, Olive.
- Hello.

408
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:24,403
- Everyone, this is Dr. Philips.
Olive Neal.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

409
00:24:24,476 --> 00:24:25,966
- You know Julian.
- Yes.

410
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:28,035
- My assistant, Lorna.
- Hi.

411
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:30,240
- Eden Brent, Kristen.
- Ah, cute dog.

412
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:32,909
- Warner Purcell. Lieutenant Masters.
- Charmed, charmed, charmed.

413
00:24:32,985 --> 00:24:35,419
- Stage manager Mitch.
- Mitch, hi, hi, hi, hi.

414
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:38,251
- And you are?
- I'm with her.

415
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:41,315
- He's with me. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

416
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:44,794
Well, um, we're just gonna
rehearse for a while, so--

417
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,798
Yeah.
Where she goes, I go.

418
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:49,824
All right, buster,
why don't you park yourself in
the back row of the theater...

419
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:51,836
and try not to snore.

420
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:54,372
Um, l--

421
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:57,431
- What?
- I don't like other people
watching rehearsals...

422
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:01,309
- generally as a rule because
the actors are very sensitive.
- What'd you say?

423
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,816
- I-l don't like--
- Hey, hey, who are you? Who are you?

424
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,841
- Whoa, whoa. Easy.
- I'm the director.

425
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:08,318
- Who is this?
- Wait a minute.

426
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:11,288
- I'm the director of the play.
- Wait a minute, Mr., uh--

427
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:14,224
- Cheech. The name's Cheech.
- Mr. Cheech, first of all--

428
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:16,989
- No, not Mr. Cheech. Ya hear me?
- Yeah.

429
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:19,997
- Cheech. Simple. Cheech.
- Cheech.

430
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:24,365
Now, why don't you just take a seat
in the back and we'll-- Yeah, go ahead.

431
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:26,997
- That's it.
- I find this very problematic.

432
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:29,233
- I'll be over there.
- He'll be unobtrusive, believe me.

433
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:32,971
He's not gonna bother anybody.
He just wants to watch.

434
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:36,014
He's my bodyguard.
[ Giggles ]

435
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:38,481
- Hi.
- Hello.

436
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:43,078
- Sorry I'm late.
I'm usually highly professional.
- Oh, I'm sure.

437
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:47,353
- This is for you.
- Oh, talcum powder. My favorite.

438
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:51,158
- Thank you. You're a doll.
- Oh, no, you're a doll.

439
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:54,962
[ David ] Helen Sinclair came a half
hour late, but she had a good excuse.

440
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:58,594
Please forgive me.
My pedicurist had a stroke.

441
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:02,295
She fell forward onto the orange stick
and plunged it into my toe.

442
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:05,241
- It required bandaging.
- Oh, my poor darling.

443
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,870
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

444
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:10,575
- We all know and admire Helen Sinclair.
- [ Warner ] We're old friends.

445
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:13,413
- Thank you so much.
- Miss Sinclair, this is Mitch.

446
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:18,548
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, my goodness' sake.
I can't believe I'm here.

447
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:22,560
Oh-ho, look at this.
Look at this. Would you look?

448
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:25,290
Oh, this old theater.

449
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:29,057
This church.

450
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:32,568
So replete
with memories.

451
00:26:32,638 --> 00:26:36,005
So full of ghosts.

452
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:38,406
Mrs. Alving.

453
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:40,445
Uncle Vanya.

454
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,914
There's Cordelia.

455
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:47,107
Here's Ophelia.

456
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:50,986
Clytemenstra!

457
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:55,025
Each performance
a birth.

458
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,426
Each curtain...

459
00:26:58,497 --> 00:27:00,556
a death.

460
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:03,328
[ Mr. Woofles Barking ]

461
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:05,597
Was that a mutt?

462
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:08,299
[ Mitch ]
Yes, Miss Sinclair.

463
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:12,503
- I hate mutts!
- [ Barking Continues ]

464
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:15,569
[ David ] I didn't want to overwhelm
any of the actors on the first day...

465
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,275
so all we did
was read through the play.

466
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,545
I can't live
like this.

467
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:24,077
The same routine
over and over and over.

468
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:26,522
The days blend together
like melted celluloid.

469
00:27:26,591 --> 00:27:30,152
Like a film whose images
become distorted and meaningless.

470
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:33,459
I want a divorce, Sylvia. I've said it
in a thousand subtle ways...

471
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:36,592
hoping you would realize,
but you refuse to see it.

472
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:39,637
As a little girl,
I swore one day...

473
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:43,038
I would have a necklace
made from the Milky Way.

474
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:48,444
Oh, Kristen, Kristen, if only humans
weren't cursed with the power of memory.

475
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:52,176
[ Olive Reading Flatly ]
Dreams are only disguised feelings.

476
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,550
The more we bring these
painful experiences to the fore...

477
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:59,488
the easier they become
to deal with.

478
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:02,118
- What's the "fore"?
- The fore. The foreground.

479
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:04,287
- [ Warner ] ls it-- Could l?
- [ David ] Please.

480
00:28:04,363 --> 00:28:08,299
It's a golf term, when you yell, "fore"
when you're coming forward.

481
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:12,133
- [ Helen ] I didn't realize that.
- So you're telling me
she's talking about golf?

482
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:13,466
- Continue!
- What?

483
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:16,166
[ Helen ]
Oh, yes, okay. Doctor...

484
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:19,439
am I unattractive,
worn out?

485
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:23,641
Spent? Broken?
Desiccated? Old?

486
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:27,981
[ Olive ] Come, come, Mrs. Poston.
You're being mas--

487
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:31,187
- Mas--
- [ David ] Masochistic.

488
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:36,159
- Masochistic?
- Yes, masochism is someone
who enjoys pain.

489
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:39,129
- [ Warner ] As opposed to sadism.
- Enjoys pain?

490
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:41,324
What is she,
retarded?

491
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:44,460
- I don't fuckin' believe this!
- Continue.

492
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:47,767
[ David ] After the rehearsal,
I felt exhilarated.

493
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:50,497
Helen Sinclair suggested
we go for a drink to unwind.

494
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:54,808
She said she knew
of a little out-of-the-way
speakeasy where we could talk.

495
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:57,515
- It was wonderful to see old, uh--
- Wasn't it?

496
00:28:57,582 --> 00:29:01,040
- Warner. Yes.
- Warner, yeah. He looks so slim.

497
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:04,214
- He's on a new diet.
- Who is she? Oh, I need a drink.

498
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:06,416
Olive. [ Chuckles ]
Yes. I'm sorry about Olive.

499
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:09,221
I do apologize.
We needed her to raise the money.

500
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:11,626
It must be difficult
getting a work like this on.

501
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:14,164
It's a sad reality
of the marketplace, I'll tell ya.

502
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:16,666
- We've never really
had a chance to talk.
- No.

503
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:20,330
- Hi, folks. What can I get you?
- Two martinis, please, very dry.

504
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:23,738
- How'd you know what I drank?
- Oh, you want one too?

505
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:25,766
- Three.
- Three martinis.

506
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:29,336
Uh, I can't judge my own writing,
but I must say...

507
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:33,578
that just from today's reading,
I can tell how brilliant
you're going to be in this role.

508
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:35,517
- It's a wonderful play.
- Thank you.

509
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:39,648
No, no, I mean it. It's so rare
that anything is really about something.

510
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:42,659
You know-- Well, there's Max Anderson
and Gene O'Neill.

511
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:45,252
- That's about it.
- You just named my two living gods.

512
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:48,266
I was a little reluctant at first
to play the part.

513
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,600
The character is so--
She's so, um... uh, colorless.

514
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:54,332
Colorless, yes.
Well, that's the idea--

515
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:56,397
- Then I realized what
you were going for.
- You did?

516
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:58,636
How profound, how complex,
her inner life really is.

517
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,178
I tried to give her
some contradictions.

518
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:03,214
I was worried.

519
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:07,274
I'm used to playing
more overtly heroic women.

520
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:10,117
Less tentative.
More alluring.

521
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:12,588
Certainly not
frigid.

522
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:17,890
No, yes, yes. Well, Sylvia Poston
is a mass of neuroses.

523
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,191
In spite of the fact that I
could really find nothing at all
in the play to brighten her up...

524
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:25,395
- no real passion, no seductiveness...
- Nothing?

525
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,768
I still think that
she's worth playing.

526
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,900
We could work it over, and
a touch here or there could be
changed to make sure you're...

527
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:35,238
- No, no, no, no.
I wouldn't dream of you...
- comfortable.

528
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:37,838
changing a word
of your work for me.

529
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:43,115
God, who am l, some
vain Broadway legend?

530
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:46,919
You... you're
a budding Chekhov.

531
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:55,223
I'm not saying I'll distort the play.
I'm just saying I'll reread it
with that in mind.

532
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,360
I mean, after all, Miss Sinclair--
Helen. May I call you Helen?

533
00:30:58,436 --> 00:31:00,563
- Yes.
- Helen...

534
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:03,767
your instincts as an actress
are impeccable.

535
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:08,575
And I want the character
to have dimension. I don't mean
for her to be a drone.

536
00:31:09,681 --> 00:31:12,844
- You see through me, don't you?
- Me?

537
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:15,216
You're clever.

538
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:17,517
You're brilliant.

539
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:20,184
What insight
into women.

540
00:31:20,258 --> 00:31:22,317
Don't deny it.

541
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:30,425
I don't see why
she has to be frigid.

542
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:38,206
[ Nick ] Hey, how ya doin', doll?
How'd it go?

543
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:40,541
[ Olive ] Ah, they're all
so stuck up.

544
00:31:40,612 --> 00:31:43,479
- Yeah? Anybody botherin' her?
- No.

545
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:46,381
They expect me to memorize
all these lines.

546
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:50,218
- Well, that's what you wanted,
isn't it? To be an actress?
- I know, I know, I know.

547
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:53,816
- I got a headache.
- Cheech'll help you
practice after we eat.

548
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:57,487
- Me?
- The girl's got stuff
to memorize, all right?

549
00:31:57,562 --> 00:32:00,827
- Yeah, but, Nick--
- Go sit in the tub, honey. Go ahead.

550
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:04,630
I'm takin' you out to Delmonico's.
You want sirloin or a lobster?

551
00:32:04,703 --> 00:32:08,366
- One of each.
- Listen, Nick, I'm not too good
at this memorizing, and I got a date--

552
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,308
All right, all right, knock it off.
I got a little errand for you to run.

553
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:17,212
- What kind of errand?
- A message for Charlie Masucci,
and we ain't got a lot of time.

554
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:33,220

561
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:04,660
Can't you see...

562
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:07,893
you're living out
the exact same pattern...

563
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:10,662
your mother lived out
with your father?

564
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:13,829
I am?
Pray tell.

565
00:33:13,905 --> 00:33:17,272
In some way,
you're trying to relive it,

566
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:21,403
and in the process
of reliving it, correct it.

567
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:24,971
As if that were possible.
Ha!

568
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,281
-It don't say "Ha."
-I know it don't say "Ha." I added that.

569
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:31,550
- What do ya mean you added that?
Are you allowed to do that?
- We're allowed to add things.

570
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:34,023
- How could you add something?
You can't do that.
- You're allowed!

571
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:36,526
- It's called ad-libbing.
- You can't do that!

572
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:39,961
I can do that. What do you know? You
don't know nothin'. Shut up and read.

573
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:43,626
- I think the whole thing stinks.
- I think you're a degenerate
zombie. Shut up and read!

574
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:46,398
- You better shut up! Just shut up!
- You shut up and read.

575
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:49,406
- You shut up!
- You're lucky you're Nick's girl.

576
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:51,408
You're lucky
you're an idiot.

577
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:56,345
What endeavors you...
to concoct a theory so tenuous?

578
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:58,110
Mmm-mmm-mm.

579
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,343
I sure pities the poor folks who gonna
have to pay to see this play.

580
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:08,458
- What ya thinking?
- Oh, just about Eugene O'Neill
and Max Anderson, you know.

581
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:11,927
Yeah. You've been rewriting all night
and it's only just the first day.

582
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:14,362
- Is that a bad sign?
- No. I just think that
I might have made...

583
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:16,798
the character of Sylvia Poston
a bit too antiseptic.

584
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:18,927
- She's gotta have a sexual side to her.
- No.

585
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:23,406
- I think she's the best female
character you've written in a long time.
- Says who?

586
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:26,842
David, you know you always have
problems getting into the female mind.

587
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:30,870
- I know that you think that.
- You've said so yourself before.
We've had this discussion.

588
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:35,545
All your friends are men. You-- You've
always had problems writing for women.

589
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,418
Witness your relationship
with your mother, your grandmother...

590
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:41,584
- your two aunts, your sister--
- I think I try to factor that
into my work.

591
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,593
But to be honest with you...

592
00:34:43,661 --> 00:34:45,595
at this moment, I don't think
you really understand my work at all.

593
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:47,722
- Oh! Don't be so defensive.
- I'm not being defensive.

594
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:51,735
Perhaps my opinions just aren't
intellectual enough for you.
Maybe they're just not--

595
00:34:51,803 --> 00:34:55,967
That's a horrible thing to say.
When you have a good idea,
I listen to it. I'm responsive.

596
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,498
- In this case, I think you're
wrong. That's about it.
- When am I right?

597
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:03,013
You're right about other things, but not
about Sylvia Poston and her sexuality.

598
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:06,642
[ David ] September 17.
The first week is behind me now...

599
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:10,552
and apart from a few minor incidents,
things seemed to go okay.

600
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:13,056
There was that moment
between Helen and Eden.

601
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:17,026
I can't do that speech if she's
going to be fidgeting around upstage!

602
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:19,689
- Well, that's why I think
I should sit. I'll sit.
- Oh, God!

603
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:23,393
Sylvia would never ask her to sit
in her own house. She despises her!

604
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:27,131
She doesn't want me to sit. She doesn't
want me to stand. I guess I could squat.

605
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:30,403
David, do you realize you're asking an
audience to believe that my husband...

606
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:32,433
would leave me
for this woman?

607
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,412
- Come along.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, but
I think it's made very clear...

608
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:39,211
in the speech about erotic attraction,
why he does that.

609
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:41,919
You fool! He's thinking of me
when he does that speech.
Don't you know anything?

610
00:35:41,953 --> 00:35:44,421
- Only the part about the liver spots.
- Listen.

611
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:48,448
How long has it been since
you've had a real hemorrhage?

612
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:52,520
David, I wonder if now would be a moment
to do my soliloquy from Act ll?

613
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:57,625
- [ Crying ] Did you hear what she--
- Please. Aspirin!

614
00:35:57,669 --> 00:36:01,435
[ David ] All right, yes, why don't we?
And, Eden, just take five.

615
00:36:01,473 --> 00:36:04,169
- I need an aspirin!
- [ Crying Continues ]

616
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:07,177
[ David ]
Mitch.

617
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:10,807
[ David ] Then there was the time when
I tried to cut one of Olive's speeches.

618
00:36:10,882 --> 00:36:14,943
- I like that speech,
and I already got it memorized.
- But it's superfluous.

619
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:17,749
- It's-- What is it?
- Well, I've overwritten it.

620
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:22,156
We know how you feel
about Sylvia's breakdown when
you talk with the good doctor.

621
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:25,025
So it's my fault.
Um, the performance is fine.

622
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:28,190
But, um...
I like to say it.

623
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:30,757
- We-- We don't need it.
- Hey!

624
00:36:30,835 --> 00:36:33,861
Are you tryin' to make
my part smaller?

625
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:36,498
- No, no, every--
- My part's small enough as it is!

626
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:40,169
Every play needs some cuts, and the size
of the role is not the important thing.

627
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:43,840
Did you hear what she said? She doesn't
want her speech taken away from her!

628
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:48,477
- Look, look, Mr. Cheech, I've about--
- I'd rather be shootin' crap myself...

629
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:53,149
but Mr. V. told me that she's gotta
be up there a lot!

630
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:55,852
- I wrote this play,
and I'm directing this play!
- I don't care.

631
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:59,886
You wanna get slapped here or do
you want me to take you outside
and we'll straighten this out?

632
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:02,660
It's up to you.

633
00:37:05,904 --> 00:37:09,670
[ David ] Warner Purcell remains
good-spirited and a joy to work with.

634
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:15,077
And what discipline. Although,
I notice he no longer has just
a cup of hot water and lemon.

635
00:37:17,315 --> 00:37:21,251
[ Eden ] lf you start it off
at that level--

636
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:26,052
Well, what are we going to do
about that canine-loving ingenue?

637
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:29,025
- Did you cast her because
you thought she was attractive?
- She's pretty...

638
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:32,722
but more importantly, she has a certain
perkiness that the character requires.

639
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:36,699
She's perky. She makes you
wanna sneak up behind her with
a pillow and suffocate her.

640
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:39,134
- It's a beautiful apartment.
- Josette.

641
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:42,036
- My beaker of martinis.
- Your taste is exquisite.

642
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:46,533
My taste is superb.
My eyes are exquisite.

643
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,738
What justifiable confidence.

644
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,341
- I think at some point you're
going to have to fire Olive.
- I'm afraid that's not possible.

645
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:57,146
Oh, how can you take her butchering
your poetry? I know I couldn't stand it.

646
00:37:57,221 --> 00:38:01,317
No one in his right mind is
going to believe she's a doctor,
not even a veterinarian.

647
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:04,619
- [ Chuckles ]
- I understand, but it's a compromise
I have to live with...

648
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:07,096
and if I want the play to open,
I have to find a way to live with it.

649
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:09,690
I plan on reducing the scope of her role
if her bodyguard will let me.

650
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:11,701
Can you believe
that character?

651
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:14,863
Imagine, traveling with
your own private Neanderthal.

652
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:17,874
- I wasn't aware that you opened
The Master Builder.
- Oh, well.

653
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:21,173
I had forgotten that
you won that drama award.

654
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:24,112
- Here's to your play.
- Oh, thank you. Our play.

655
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:27,982
To an ideal world
with no compromise.

656
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,259
Oh, my gosh,
look at this view!

657
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:40,059
A million blinking lights.
A million broken hearts.

658
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:42,656
- You know what's down there?
- What?

659
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:45,794
- Broadway.
- Ah. That's your street.

660
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,933
Mm-hmm. Yes, that's my street,
but I'd like to give it to you.

661
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:54,968
- That is, if you want it.
- Who wouldn't want it?

662
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:58,812
I want you to write a play for me.
Oh, I mean when all this is over.

663
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,650
- Really?
- Your next play, I want you to create
a vehicle for Helen Sinclair.

664
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,917
- I'm honored.
- But it must have size...

665
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,117
an important woman.

666
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:11,855
- A Borgia. A Curie. You name it.
- Yes!

667
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:14,864
- I'll dedicate myself to it.
- Oh, and while you're at it...

668
00:39:14,932 --> 00:39:18,197
if you could just have
a look at that scene in Act ll.

669
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:22,434
If she succeeds in seducing
the Lieutenant instead of
being rejected a second time...

670
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:27,839
- it could add some variation
to the character.
- Yes, that's a wonderful idea.

671
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:30,370
The heart is "labyrinthinine..."

672
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:34,782
a maze beset with brutal pitfalls
and mean obstacles.

673
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:39,255
David, I can't say that line. It doesn't
make sense. It's stupid. I don't get it.

674
00:39:39,323 --> 00:39:42,986
- It's just a stylish way
of expressing a particular idea.
- Idea? What idea?

675
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:45,188
The agony of love.
The difficulty of relating.

676
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:47,925
- Why do you have to make it
so hard to say?
- Just say the line.

677
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:50,991
- No, I can't say it.
It's a mouthful of "ghibberish."
- Gibberish!

678
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:53,833
- I can't say it, and I will not say it.
- Just do the line.

679
00:39:53,905 --> 00:39:55,839
No! I'm not making
a fool of myself.

680
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:57,841
[ Cheech ]
She's right, it stinks.

681
00:39:57,909 --> 00:40:00,343
Oh-ho, Jesus,
another party heard from.

682
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:03,040
It's a stupid way of talkin',
and nobody talks like that.

683
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:05,480
- I don't believe this is happening.
- Frankenstein is right.

684
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:07,708
When I want your opinion,
I will ask for it.

685
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:10,482
I can't stand to listen to this
garbage. Every day I sit back there...

686
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:12,485
and I hear the same bullshit
over and over again.

687
00:40:12,724 --> 00:40:14,487
Then leave.
No one asked you here.

688
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:16,387
[ Helen ]
Oh, David, take it easy.

689
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:18,827
Where did you study play writing?
Was it Sing Sing?

690
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:21,228
"A maze beset
by brutal pitfalls--"

691
00:40:21,265 --> 00:40:23,859
Hey, Olive, I memorized it,
and I'm tellin' ya...

692
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:27,371
it comes to me all the time,
and it stinks on fuckin' hot ice!

693
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:30,407
- That's it. I quit. This is crazy.
- [ Warner ] David.

694
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:34,172
- Oh, please, I have a little hangover!
- I am famished.

695
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:37,305
Everyone, everyone,
why don't we take lunch? An hour?

696
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:40,248
- [ Mr. Woofles Barking ]
- You don't wanna
say the goddamned line...

697
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:43,515
- don't say the goddamned line!
- Oh, look at you, Mr. Temperamental.

698
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:47,350
[ Helen ] lf that rat on a leash
barks one more time--

699
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:50,326
-He sounds melancholy. Is he melancholy?
-You can trim the line.

700
00:40:50,394 --> 00:40:53,852
- Because she can't handle it?
- Because you said yourself
you were having trouble with it.

701
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:56,161
- So you agree with the gorilla?
- David, for Christ sake! It's one line!

702
00:40:56,234 --> 00:40:58,429
- It's not going to wreck the scene.
- That's not the point!

703
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:01,927
Suddenly I'm taking suggestions from a
strong-arm man with an l.Q. of minus 50.

704
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:03,974
I've had it!

705
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:07,307
- David, for goodness' sake. Come on.
- Look who's here.

706
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:10,211
Oh, God!
Get my rifle!

707
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:13,808
I guess I'm just hypersensitive because
maybe deep down, I agree with the goon.

708
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:18,288
- Maybe it is a turgid line.
I don't know. My nerves are shot.
- No. Just calm yourself.

709
00:41:18,322 --> 00:41:23,021
Helen, the play is not working.
It's not working, and it's in my
writing. It's not just Olive.

710
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:27,292
That's the reason we have rehearsal.
That's the reason we go out of town.

711
00:41:29,267 --> 00:41:32,759
You have such a wonderful attitude.
I'm so lucky.

712
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:35,465
The best part of this project every day
is that I get to come to work...

713
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,441
and see you and be with you
and work with you.

714
00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:43,003
- I don't mean to spoil the day.
- Then let's not.

715
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,379
Sit down here.
I'm going to show you something.

716
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,350
Okay.

717
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,287
This is my favorite spot
in the park.

718
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:57,523
And in winter,
when it's covered with snow...

719
00:41:57,595 --> 00:42:02,294
at about 4:30 in the afternoon,
when it's just getting dark
and the lights come on...

720
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,301
it's all misty.

721
00:42:04,368 --> 00:42:09,271
And you can just see the silhouettes of
the Manhattan skyline through the trees.

722
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,831
And it's magical.

723
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:14,241
It's magical.

724
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,574
Helen, I think I'm falling
in love with you.

725
00:42:18,816 --> 00:42:20,613
Don't.

726
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:24,845
- I don't know if I can help it.
- David, please, we must be strong.

727
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:28,483
I've kept a check on my feelings
for so long, but there's
so much that I want to say.

728
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:31,153
- What are words?
- Oh, gosh.

729
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:34,494
David, everything meaningful
is in some unexplainable form.

730
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:38,831
It's-- It's more primordial
than mere language.

731
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:41,269
- I'm not sure I follow that one.
- Oh, be silent.

732
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:43,307
- Be silent.
- Helen--

733
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:46,468
No, let's just sit here
holding our thoughts.

734
00:42:46,544 --> 00:42:49,377
Not revealing them.
Be still.

735
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:54,214
Let the birds have their song.
Let ours for now remain unsung.

736
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:56,412
You're amazing.

737
00:42:56,487 --> 00:43:00,389
## [ "Ain't Misbehavin"' ]

738
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:05,256
Stop it.
Stop it.

739
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:08,059
- I'm not in the mood!
- What do you mean
you're not in the mood?

740
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:10,327
Honey, you better get in the mood,
'cause he's payin' the rent.

741
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:14,235
Shut up, Venus!
Just what I said: I'm not in the mood.

742
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:18,901
- Do I have to be in the mood
every time you are?
- Stop puttin' on the airs.

743
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:22,242
- I'm not puttin' on airs.
- I never knew you when you wasn't
ready for a little action.

744
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,239
Well, today, I'm not ready for action.
I'm tired. Rehearsal is hard.

745
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:29,377
- Get your motor goin'.
- No!

746
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:32,581
- Hey, I brought you somethin'.
- What?

747
00:43:32,657 --> 00:43:35,888
- Huh?
- Hmm.

748
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,928
What do ya say?
Come on.

749
00:43:37,962 --> 00:43:41,022
- Nickie.
- Oh, I got a great bottle
of French wine.

750
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:43,066
Joey Foster
made it himself.

751
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:45,602
Pasadena. I'm pooped.

752
00:43:45,636 --> 00:43:48,002
# Let's misbehave #

753
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:51,235
# There's something wild
about you, child-- ##

754
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:53,641
[ David ] Today, Ellen came
to watch rehearsal.

755
00:43:53,711 --> 00:43:57,374
She was very excited to meet the cast,
especially Warner Purcell.

756
00:43:57,448 --> 00:44:02,181
- Warner, Warner, Warner.
This is Ellen. My girlfriend.
- Oh! Pleased to meet you.

757
00:44:02,253 --> 00:44:06,053
- You should be very proud.
He has a rare talent.
- Yes, he does.

758
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:08,990
[ David ] The morning proceeded
very smoothly for the first half hour.

759
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:10,994
And then
another incident occurred.

760
00:44:11,062 --> 00:44:15,089
The heart obeys
its own rules. Ha!

761
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:19,626
As a doctor, your respect for
rationalities is not very profound.

762
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:21,638
- David, l-- David, can l--
- [ David ] Yes?

763
00:44:21,706 --> 00:44:25,472
I don't understand the character here.
Suddenly, she's too wise.

764
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:29,707
And, David, I don't know why she's
telling her to dump her fiance.

765
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:32,313
- She's caught up with the Lieutenant.
- The Lieutenant?

766
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,080
But it's as if she's just mouthing
the playwright's philosophy.

767
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:38,349
- Why would she just up and leave Tom?
- Because she's impulsive.

768
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:41,950
- It doesn't feel right.
- Well, yeah, and I don't
understand, you know...

769
00:44:42,026 --> 00:44:45,325
if I'm a doctor, how come
I'm giving her such bad advice?

770
00:44:45,363 --> 00:44:47,490
- It's not bad advice.
- It is bad advice.

771
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:51,524
But, David, you see, in Act l,
she says that Tom changed her life.

772
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:55,163
- Yes, but she's recklessly
driven to the Lieutenant.
- It doesn't make sense.

773
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:57,537
- Just give it a chance.
- There's something
contradictory about it.

774
00:44:57,608 --> 00:44:59,974
- Just give it a chance.
- It's just bad writing.

775
00:45:00,044 --> 00:45:02,672
[ Cheech ]
I'll tell ya what's wrong.

776
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:05,409
- Oh, Christ! Julian?
- Now let's wait a minute.

777
00:45:05,483 --> 00:45:09,317
- Let's not get into a situation here.
- She shouldn't leave the guy.

778
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:11,514
She should stick with him.

779
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:15,719
Then when the Lieutenant has
that fight with his wife and
walks out, he should notice her.

780
00:45:15,793 --> 00:45:18,455
That way,
it won't be boring.

781
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:30,173
Somebody say something!

782
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:33,699
- I think it's a good idea.
- [ Julian ] It's not a bad one.

783
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:36,008
- You're kidding.
- Oh, no.

784
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,241
It's, uh--
It really isn't.

785
00:45:38,315 --> 00:45:41,284
[ Warner ] Personally, I like it.
I think it's very dramatic.

786
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:44,344
Ellen, do you see what I'm up against?
Do you see what I have to put up with?

787
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:47,323
- I think he has an interesting concept.
- What?

788
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,586
Not to say that--

789
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,151
- She doesn't leave the Lieutenant.
- Right.

790
00:45:52,229 --> 00:45:54,254
- She doesn't leave her fiance.
- Right.

791
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:57,630
We lose that scene, and suddenly
a lot of good possibilities open up.

792
00:45:57,701 --> 00:46:00,568
- [ Cheech ] It's a helluva lot
better than what you got.
- I actually like it.

793
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:03,129
- You're taking his side?
- It's not a question of sides.

794
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:06,574
- David, she's right.
The play always bogged down there.
- Try it.

795
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:10,569
- That's why the actors
always looked so uncomfortable.
- I can't make those changes.

796
00:46:10,614 --> 00:46:15,051
- Why not? H-H-How do they meet again?
- Because the--

797
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,453
The Lieutenant notices her, right?
And then, he goes after her.

798
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:23,449
I mean, that's the way
it would happen in real life.
He goes after her. Come on.

799
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:27,725
You can't force it, kid. I mean, if it's
meant to go in a whole other direction--

800
00:46:27,798 --> 00:46:31,256
- I quit!
- Oh, don't be so egotistical.

801
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:33,496
- I'm outta here.
- Egotistical? Why?
Because I protect my play?

802
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:37,098
- Protect it against what? A good idea?
- Oh, thank you for the support.

803
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:40,338
- No, no, I quit! That's it. Good-bye.
- I'm gonna go shoot crap.

804
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:42,606
- That's it. I quit.
- Wait a minute.

805
00:46:42,646 --> 00:46:45,615
[ Julian ]
David. David!

806
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:47,844
- I'm gonna go shoot crap.
- David.

807
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:51,282
- [ Mr. Woofles Barking ]
- Mommy's coming.

808
00:46:51,355 --> 00:46:56,315
If an artist can, it gives us all a
much better chance, and he is an artist.

809
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,761
- Is that why he's getting all hot
and bothered all the time?
- Artists are very emotional.

810
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:02,594
- Artists are emotional, are they?
- Yes, they are.

811
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:05,431
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask ya...

812
00:47:05,503 --> 00:47:10,270
is it my imagination
or are you always... Iookin' my way?

813
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:13,310
- You're a very observant girl.
Yes, I have been looking at you.
- Thank you.

814
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:16,336
Yeah, well, I notice somethin'.
I notice you have...

815
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,645
a really
big appetite.

816
00:47:19,717 --> 00:47:23,153
- Yes, I do have a big appetite.
- Yeah, I noticed that, but--

817
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,279
- Where's your baby-sitter?
- What, Cheech?

818
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:28,325
- Yes.
- Ah, you don't have to worry
about Cheech. He took off.

819
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:32,419
- Did he?
- A minute there's a chance,
he runs off to play craps.

820
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:35,897
- Takes about two hours.
- Well, listen, now that
you've been let off the leash...

821
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:38,601
- Yeah?
- why don't we go in...

822
00:47:38,669 --> 00:47:41,934
- and get to know each other
a bit better?
- Okay.

823
00:47:42,173 --> 00:47:44,698
That might be pleasant.
[ Giggles ]

824
00:47:49,713 --> 00:47:51,374
- [ Giggles ]
- Well.

825
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:53,382
- Hi.
- Hi.

826
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,645
Hi.

827
00:47:58,355 --> 00:48:00,915
- You're a very attr--
Wait just a minute.
- What? What? What?

828
00:48:02,526 --> 00:48:04,790
- Before we start--
- Yeah?

829
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:07,160
- What? Oh.
- Just a--

830
00:48:07,231 --> 00:48:10,257
A little poultry.
[ Giggles ]
Okay.

831
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:12,268
- All right. Let's go.
- All right.

832
00:48:12,336 --> 00:48:14,827
You do have a big appetite.
[ Giggles ]

833
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:18,363
- Pull yourself together.
So he came up with a good idea.
- [ Sighs ]

834
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:20,843
- Helen, not you too?
- If you did follow his suggestion...

835
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:24,176
you'd be able to put in that new scene
in Act Ill that you've always wanted to.

836
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:28,184
- Yes, but it'd--
- And that, that casts
a whole new light...

837
00:48:28,252 --> 00:48:30,652
on my relationship
with my husband. Yes!

838
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:33,349
So you're saying
you want me to change it?

839
00:48:33,424 --> 00:48:36,825
At the risk of seeing you
upset on your birthday.

840
00:48:36,894 --> 00:48:39,556
- How did you know it was my birthday?
- Happy birthday.

841
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,827
- Helen! Ohh.
- Open it.

842
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,494
Gosh!

843
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:48,868
Oh, gosh.
Really. It's--

844
00:48:48,939 --> 00:48:51,669
Don't get too excited.
I didn't buy it.

845
00:48:51,742 --> 00:48:54,711
Cole Porter gave it to me.
It's one of many.

846
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:57,372
- Now I'm gonna have to take up smoking.
- Hmm.

847
00:48:57,448 --> 00:49:00,508
Have a good time tonight
with your girlfriend.
I'm sure she's taking you out.

848
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:04,680
- Yes, with the Marxes.
- Yes, well... make a birthday wish.

849
00:49:04,755 --> 00:49:09,556
- I have.
- I hope you get everything
in life that you want.

850
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:11,561
Helen, have you thought
about what I said before...

851
00:49:11,595 --> 00:49:13,825
- about the way I feel?
- Don't speak.

852
00:49:15,032 --> 00:49:18,365
- But I want to express--
- Don't speak. Don't.

853
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:21,871
- Just a few things I want to tell you.
- Don't speak.

854
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:24,874
- When we first met-- [ Muffled ]
- No, no. Don't speak.

855
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:28,002
Please don't speak.
Please don't speak.

856
00:49:28,245 --> 00:49:30,975
No! No!
No! Go!

857
00:49:31,048 --> 00:49:34,882
Go, gentle Scorpio, go!

858
00:49:34,952 --> 00:49:39,321
Your Pisces wishes you
every happy return.

859
00:49:40,024 --> 00:49:42,322
- Just one--
- Don't speak!

860
00:49:42,393 --> 00:49:44,623
##

861
00:49:44,695 --> 00:49:48,654
- [ Sighs ]
- Wow, a wallet!

862
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:51,691
- That's appropriate.
- It was the nicest one I saw by far.

863
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:55,034
- The piping. That's real leather.
- Places to put stuff in there.

864
00:49:55,272 --> 00:49:57,069
- You like it?
- It's amazing. Beautiful.

865
00:49:57,308 --> 00:49:59,299
- You like it?
- Yes, really.

866
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:03,302
- Now all I need is some money,
and it'll hold its shape.
- You will prosper, my friend.

867
00:50:03,347 --> 00:50:06,544
- I promise. [ Chuckles ]
Am I right, Hilda?
- No, I love it.

868
00:50:06,617 --> 00:50:09,984
- Can I pick 'em or can I pick 'em?
- Oh, you sure can, Julian.

869
00:50:10,054 --> 00:50:13,046
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks for spending it with me.

870
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,622
- Oh, it's wonderful.
- Hilda, touch glasses there.

871
00:50:19,063 --> 00:50:22,624
Hey, look who's here
with his girlfriend.

872
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,965
- [ Ellen ] Oh, no.
- I owe that big Gorgonzola an apology.

873
00:50:26,036 --> 00:50:30,632
What are you talking about?
Now that he's drunk, he's gonna
apologize to everyone. Strangers.

874
00:50:30,674 --> 00:50:34,940
[ David ] Today at rehearsal,
he came up with that little
suggestion, and I overreacted.

875
00:50:35,012 --> 00:50:38,812
I let my ego get in the way of the work,
and I feel I owe him an apology.

876
00:50:38,882 --> 00:50:42,409
- Ah, you're all right.
You handled it very well.
- I'll be right back.

877
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:53,658
I take it all back. It was a good
suggestion, and I apologize.

878
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:55,722
- Say hello to Violet.
- Hi, Violet.

879
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:58,461
- Hi, nice to meet you.
Who's this, Cheech?
- He's a writer.

880
00:50:58,535 --> 00:51:02,403
- I'm a struggling writer.
- You wanna know what the problem
with your story is?

881
00:51:02,473 --> 00:51:06,534
- What's the problem?
Are you gonna do some more rewrites?
- Sit down. Take a load off your feet.

882
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:10,343
- Moe, go on. Come here. Get him a beer.
- Why not?

883
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:12,372
- [ Violet ] He's a writer?
- Yeah.

884
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:15,715
- I didn't know you knew writers.
- Do me a favor. Shut up.

885
00:51:15,786 --> 00:51:17,720
Don't tell me
to shut up.

886
00:51:17,755 --> 00:51:20,121
All right,
number one.

887
00:51:20,357 --> 00:51:23,485
See, I don't believe she loves
the guy right from the start.

888
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:27,018
She's too on, uh, top of him
all the time. That's not love.

889
00:51:27,097 --> 00:51:30,897
That's like keeping somebody in prison.
But if you changed it, right?

890
00:51:30,968 --> 00:51:33,766
And she left him,
then she would feel so bad about it...

891
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:37,705
- that she would have the
nervous breakdown and go nuts.
- [ Music Stops, Applause ]

892
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:40,539
- How ya doin', Cheech?
- Tulio, listen, I gotta see you later.

893
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:44,069
- I wanna get down on the Cardinals
for the doubleheader, all right?
- You got it.

894
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:48,414
- Them birds look good.
- Teach your friend some manners
and get him outta here.

895
00:51:48,452 --> 00:51:50,943
- All right, so--
- You were-- You were talking about--

896
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:53,615
Right, all right.
So, now...

897
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:57,751
if the doctor feels what Sylvia's
feelin'-- That's her name, Sylvia.

898
00:51:57,828 --> 00:52:00,160
- There's a Sylvia in my neighborhood.
- Oh, yeah?

899
00:52:00,397 --> 00:52:03,662
-Yeah. What was her name? Sylvia Pincus.
-Sylvia Pincus.

900
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:06,498
Sylvia Pincus. Big, fat Jewish broad,
had a little tiny husband.

901
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,403
She chopped him up with an ax and mailed
his pieces all over the country.

902
00:52:09,473 --> 00:52:11,805
I don't know what
she was tryin' to prove.

903
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:13,809
That's disgusting. You gotta
tell that story in front of me?

904
00:52:13,877 --> 00:52:15,504
- Relax.
- You know I got a weak stomach.

905
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:18,047
- You were tellin' me
about the play a minute ago.
- Don't interrupt me.

906
00:52:18,115 --> 00:52:21,050
- You were sayin' about Sylvia?
- Right. So if the doctor feels
what Sylvia's feelin'--

907
00:52:21,118 --> 00:52:23,109
- Uh-huh.
- Know what I mean?

908
00:52:23,187 --> 00:52:26,156
Yeah. She identifies
with her patient, a bit.

909
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:29,990
Right. This way when she gets jealous,
it makes sense.

910
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:31,961
- Right.
- Uh-huh.

911
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:34,827
There's gotta be a time when the
Lieutenant has it out with the doctor.

912
00:52:34,898 --> 00:52:36,832
Why isn't that in there?

913
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,027
You're talking about a whole
different direction for the play.

914
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:41,036
Definitely.

915
00:52:42,773 --> 00:52:44,707
Think about it.

916
00:52:44,775 --> 00:52:48,541
How would the audience know
Sylvia was feeling guilty? lf--

917
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:50,773
Oh. I don't know.

918
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:52,816
Wait a minute.
Yeah. Wait.

919
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:56,809
You could work it out with maybe you--
you hear what she's thinkin'.

920
00:52:56,854 --> 00:52:59,789
-You mean she speaks her thoughts aloud?
-Sure, why not? It's a play anyhow.

921
00:52:59,857 --> 00:53:02,951
It don't have to be real,
but it'll be stronger.

922
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:06,793
You think about that.
And you, don't interrupt me no more.

923
00:53:06,864 --> 00:53:08,798
I'm sorry.

924
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:15,163
So how come you had so much
to say to that Valenti goon?

925
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:17,707
No, nothing. I was just
thanking him for his ideas.

926
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:21,802
- What ideas? He only had
the one suggestion, didn't he?
- Yeah.

927
00:53:21,879 --> 00:53:24,848
- That was just it.
- So do you like your wallet?

928
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:26,850
- What?
- The wallet.

929
00:53:26,884 --> 00:53:29,182
- Oh, yes, yes, it's terrific.
- Are you sure?

930
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:32,746
Oh, it's very exciting. I love
leatherette. Always have loved it.

931
00:53:32,823 --> 00:53:35,155
Boy, are you loaded.

932
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:37,216
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday.

933
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:39,228
Thanks.

934
00:53:41,565 --> 00:53:46,502
[ David ] September 24. I gave the cast
the rewrites. Everyone seemed pleased.

935
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:49,266
- [ Helen ] These are brilliant! Oh!
- [ Warner ] They are.

936
00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:51,497
Now Sylvia's
not so passive.

937
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:55,534
She uses her wiles to trap
the Lieutenant, and that's
what causes her guilt!

938
00:53:55,612 --> 00:53:58,046
[ Warner ] The whole thing is motivated.
It drives on. Wonderful.

939
00:53:58,115 --> 00:54:01,642
- [ Olive ] You mean I gotta
memorize all new lines?
- [ Helen ] They're wonderful!

940
00:54:01,718 --> 00:54:05,950
- How did you come up
with such divine changes?
- They're not really mine--

941
00:54:06,023 --> 00:54:09,959
- Oh, no? Whose are they, God's?
- [ Laughing ]

942
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:13,758
- Well, they are mine
in the sense that they're mine--
- Your modesty becomes you.

943
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,991
But let's face it;
you are a major talent.

944
00:54:16,066 --> 00:54:18,125
A major new voice
in the theater.

945
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:21,728
The word genius gets thrown around
so frequently in this business...

946
00:54:21,772 --> 00:54:24,206
- but, darling, if the shoe fits--
- Congratulations.

947
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:28,210
- It finally has balls.
- Now, if we can do something
about Act Ill...

948
00:54:28,278 --> 00:54:30,678
we got a big, fat hit
on our hands.

949
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:34,581
- [ Warner ] Three cheers
for the writer! Hip-hip--
- [ Cast ] Hooray!

950
00:54:34,618 --> 00:54:37,815
[ David ] I stayed up all night
working on the third act.

951
00:54:37,888 --> 00:54:39,822
I admit it came rather hard...

952
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:43,121
and before I handed in the pages,
I sent them over to Cheech to read.

953
00:54:43,193 --> 00:54:45,923
He suggested I come down
to his office.

954
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:52,661
- You missed the idea.
- I did?

955
00:54:52,736 --> 00:54:55,296
Yeah, you did.
Plus, nobody talks like that.

956
00:54:55,372 --> 00:54:58,808
- You got that problem.
You don't write like people talk.
- I take poetic license.

957
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:03,574
Poetic license, bullshit.
People believe what they see
when the actors sound real.

958
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:06,616
- Come here. Let me show you.
- What are you doing?

959
00:55:06,683 --> 00:55:08,674
- What does it look like I'm doin'?
- You're gonna write it?

960
00:55:08,752 --> 00:55:12,950
What am l? A fuckin' idiot?
They taught me how to write in
school before I burned it down.

961
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:17,120
- You burned down your school?
- Yeah, it was Lincoln's birthday.
There was nobody there.

962
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:20,220
- If you actually write--
- Look, I know how people talk,
all right?

963
00:55:20,297 --> 00:55:22,265
Go shoot a rack,
and let me do this.

964
00:55:22,299 --> 00:55:25,097
But if you actually write it,
then I'm not--

965
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:27,659
- Don't worry about it.
I ain't gonna tell anybody.
- No?

966
00:55:27,738 --> 00:55:30,673
No. I saw you playin' the big shot.
I know what it's all about.

967
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:33,141
Where I come from,
nobody squeals.

968
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:41,010
Go shoot a rack.

969
00:55:41,084 --> 00:55:43,416
Stop starin' at me.

970
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:47,613
[ Helen ] What dialogue!
This is better than O'Neill!

971
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:49,181
Max Anderson
will never touch you!

972
00:55:49,259 --> 00:55:51,193
So you liked it.

973
00:55:51,261 --> 00:55:55,061
It's so full of passion!
It's so full of life!

974
00:55:55,132 --> 00:55:59,125
- I hoped it would lift the story.
- What a difference between this
and your first draft.

975
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:04,162
You hadn't found yourself yet. The idea
was there, but it hadn't crystallized.

976
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:07,039
You needed to hear it
on its feet, and now this.

977
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:10,136
It's no longer tepid
and cerebral.

978
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,014
It's full of life!
It's full of passion!

979
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:18,111
It reeks with humid sexuality!
It's carnivorous at last!

980
00:56:18,188 --> 00:56:22,716
- You thought my first draft
was cerebral and tepid?
- Only the plot and dialogue.

981
00:56:22,793 --> 00:56:26,820
- But this--
- Was-Was-Was there nothing
in the original draft...

982
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:28,865
that you feel
is worth saving?

983
00:56:28,899 --> 00:56:32,164
The stage directions were lucid.
Best I've ever seen.

984
00:56:32,202 --> 00:56:34,898
- And the color of the binder.
Good choice.
- Thank you.

985
00:56:34,971 --> 00:56:37,030
I always had a flare
for stage directions.

986
00:56:37,107 --> 00:56:41,339
I went back and reread your
earlier plays. They suffered
from the same problem.

987
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:45,075
- [ Sighs ]
- Good ideas, but
too contrived, no real guts.

988
00:56:45,148 --> 00:56:47,139
It's like you
finally happened.

989
00:56:47,217 --> 00:56:49,481
- Helen, I have a confession to make.
- Yes?

- Don't speak!

No, no, don't speak.
I know you wanna deprecate yourself.

993
00:56:57,294 --> 00:57:01,697
I know you do, but you're
going to take this town by storm.

994
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:08,063
I didn't...

995
00:57:09,339 --> 00:57:12,035
realize what
an inspiration...

996
00:57:12,075 --> 00:57:14,373
you've been
to my writing.

997
00:57:14,444 --> 00:57:16,935
Oh, David.

998
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,278
Dear, dear David.

Pungent,
seething artist.

The cocoon
has opened.

1001
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,960
I would give my body freely to
the man who wrote those words.

1002
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:38,057
Those glorious,
powerful words.

- Helen--
- No, don't speak.

- Don't speak. Don't speak.
No. Silence. Silence.

- Don't speak.
- [ Mumbles ] Please.

1006
00:57:49,746 --> 00:57:53,204
[ David ] September 28.
The play is working much better now.

1007
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:57,219
Helen has been getting on more
pleasantly with Eden, and I
believe she likes Mr. Woofles.

- [ Barking ]
- Back! Back! Back! Back!

1009
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:04,791
[ David ] Warner Purcell and Olive seem
to always be exchanging coy glances.

1010
00:58:04,828 --> 00:58:08,286
I don't know if it's my imagination, but
he seems to have put on a little weight.

1011
00:58:08,365 --> 00:58:14,167
Perhaps the tension of our
upcoming Boston opening has
caused him to cheat on his diet.

1012
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:16,432
[ David ] Can we go
from "God of our fathers"?

1013
00:58:19,976 --> 00:58:22,308
Take it from
"God of our fathers."

1014
00:58:28,285 --> 00:58:33,587
[ Ellen ] Oh! God of our fathers,
help me! Help me!

1015
00:58:33,824 --> 00:58:37,920
I was thinkin' about
when Sylvia's in the crazy house--

00:58:37,994 --> 00:58:39,928
- Sanitarium.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- She gets the D.T.s,
and she sees things.
- She hallucinates.

1018
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:46,529
- No, she sees things.
You know, like visions.
- Like what kind of visions?

1019
00:58:46,603 --> 00:58:50,937
- Like her dead husband,
and then they have that talk.
- The one in the third act?

1020
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:54,374
That's right. She couldn't
face up to him when he was alive.

1021

That's great. That's great.
That's great.

1056
01:00:53,363 --> 01:00:56,628
Those blue-haired bitches used to
whack us with rulers. Forget teachers.

1057
01:00:56,666 --> 01:01:00,329
- There was a boy I knew when I was
growing up, and he played accordion.
- Yeah?

1058
01:01:00,403 --> 01:01:04,203
I loved accordion. And I practiced
and practiced, and I got fluent.

1059
01:01:04,274 --> 01:01:08,301
Yet he would squeeze one single note,
and the sound of it would make you cry.

1060
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:11,108
-I used to want to dance. You know that?
-Make you cry.

1061
01:01:11,181 --> 01:01:15,447
- I mean it.
You ever see George Raft dance?
- Oh, yeah.

1062
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:24,393
- So--
- What?

1063
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:29,057
Mr. Marx says that you, uh, actually
rubbed a few people out. Is that true?

1064
01:01:29,132 --> 01:01:31,623
- What is this, the third degree?
- Not at all.

1065
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:34,499
- Then why you sayin' that for?
- I'm just really--

1066
01:01:34,537 --> 01:01:37,028
The truth is
I'm fascinated.

1067
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:40,201
- I took care of a few guys.
- Why?

1068
01:01:40,276 --> 01:01:42,210
Why, why?
I don't know why.

1069
01:01:42,278 --> 01:01:45,213
They cheated Mr. V. They went back
on a debt. I'll tell you one thing.

1070
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:48,216
I never rubbed out a guy
who didn't deserve it.

1071
01:01:50,987 --> 01:01:56,391
Uh, so what does it actually
feel like when you actually...

1072
01:01:56,459 --> 01:01:58,552
- What?
- k-kill a man?

1073
01:01:58,628 --> 01:02:00,755
- It feels okay.
- It feels okay?

1074
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:04,057
- Yeah.
- Even the first time?

1075
01:02:04,134 --> 01:02:07,194
First time?
First time was a punk in prison.

1076
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:10,637
He squealed on me, and I stuck
an ice pick in his back.

1077
01:02:10,707 --> 01:02:12,698
- An ice pick?
- An ice pick, yeah.

1078
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:17,076
Had to do it over and over, 40 times.
It was a mess. Forget about it.

1079
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:23,009
##
[ Narrating ] October 1.
Helen Sinclair gave a party.

1080
01:02:23,053 --> 01:02:25,715
It was like being in a dream.
Maxwell Anderson was there...

1081
01:02:25,789 --> 01:02:28,587
and George S. Kaufman
and Gertrude Lawrence.

1082
01:02:28,658 --> 01:02:32,253
[ Helen ] Darling, I want you to meet
my playwright, David Shayne.

1083
01:02:32,328 --> 01:02:36,025
[ Lord Chafee ] Oh, you have
quite a find here, darling.
Word's all over the streets.

1084
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:39,068
Oh, well, Helen's made me out to be
quite a hero. You're too kind.

1085
01:02:39,135 --> 01:02:41,296
No, I'm not kind.
Helen will vouch for that.

1086
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:44,101
But I read your play,
and it's nothing short of marvelous.

1087
01:02:44,174 --> 01:02:46,438
I let him read the rewrite,
not the eunuch version.

1088
01:02:46,509 --> 01:02:51,139
- My tongue is hanging out to
present it on the London stage.
- London?

1089
01:02:51,214 --> 01:02:55,082
Look at his face, Helen. You're
going to be the toast of Broadway.

1090
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:57,142
Why not the West End, hmm?

1091
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:00,621
-Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed the show.
-It was extraordinary.

1092
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:03,284
What's this I hear
about Helen's latest? ls that true?

1093
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:06,760
- Oh, yes. He's creating
a vehicle for Helen for next season.
- Really?

1094
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:10,630
It's a little idea she's wanted to
do for years. She plays Jesus' mother.

1095
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,634
- Oh!
- It's a whole Oedipal thing:

1096
01:03:12,702 --> 01:03:16,103
He loves her, wants to do in the father.
Well, you can see the complications.

1097
01:03:16,172 --> 01:03:19,141
- Of course.
- Of course, we're talking
to lra Gershwin...

1098
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:22,633
about a modern musical version
of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

1099
01:03:22,712 --> 01:03:27,479
- Quasimodo Jones.
- Helen has such a-a-a-- a new vitality.

1100
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:31,577
- Even her face looks so smooth.
- I know. The monkey glands are working.

1101
01:03:36,493 --> 01:03:39,462
Can you leave
your purse here, or is it--

1102
01:03:39,496 --> 01:03:42,522
- Why did you close the door?
- I've wanted to be alone with you...

1103
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:44,692
since this
boring party began.

1104
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:48,703
This party, boring?
This party's magnificent! It's glorious!

1105
01:03:48,771 --> 01:03:51,501
Make love to me.

1106
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:53,804
Here? Now?

1107
01:03:53,843 --> 01:03:58,405
- I see no reason to wait.
- Jerome Kern is on
the other side of the door.

1108
01:03:58,481 --> 01:04:00,813
Yes, he's a wonderful composer.
You'll have to meet him.

1109
01:04:00,884 --> 01:04:04,320
Now hang up your pants.

1110
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:07,585
I feel good today. You know, I went
to 34th Street. I got this new dress.

1111
01:04:07,657 --> 01:04:09,591
- You like it?
- It's very nice.

1112
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:12,492
- Isn't it? I think we
should go dancin' tonight.
- We're gonna go dancin'.

1113
01:04:12,529 --> 01:04:14,497
- I gotta take care of some business.
- Business now?

1114
01:04:14,531 --> 01:04:17,523
- Oh, come on.
- I'll take you dancin' in
a minute. Just stay there.

1115
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:19,535
All right.

1116
01:04:26,709 --> 01:04:30,577
- Hey, I wanna talk to you.
- Hi, Cheech! What are you doing here?

1117
01:04:30,647 --> 01:04:34,413
Listen, usually I wouldn't give you
no warning, but you're a good actor.

1118
01:04:34,484 --> 01:04:37,612
You're doin' a good job, and it'll
be a big problem if you're not around.

1119
01:04:37,687 --> 01:04:41,589
But I'm tellin' you right now:
lf you go near Nick Valenti's
girl one more time...

1120
01:04:41,658 --> 01:04:45,424
I'm gonna stick my gun in your mouth
and blow a hole in the top of your head.

1121
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:49,158
- All right?
- Cheech, it's so funny how you've
misconstrued the situation.

1122
01:04:49,232 --> 01:04:52,531
Listen to me. I said don't give me
no shit now, you hear?

1123
01:04:52,569 --> 01:04:54,833
- All right, all right.
- I know what's goin' on.

1124
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:56,838
- I understand, Mr. Cheech.
- You understand?

1125
01:04:56,906 --> 01:05:00,273
- I do understand, yes.
- Next time I come back angry.
You hear what I said?

1126
01:05:00,343 --> 01:05:03,278
- Yes, I understand.
- And next time you go near
her, you're a dead man.

1127
01:05:03,346 --> 01:05:06,281
- Point taken. Thank you, thank you.
- Now get out of here.

1128
01:05:17,193 --> 01:05:20,458
Mmm! Waiter!
Waiter.

1129
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:24,899
Could you bring me
some more potatoes, please?
And I'll have the pork loin now. Lovely.

1130
01:05:24,968 --> 01:05:28,426
Thank you.
Oh, and one more thing.

1131
01:05:28,504 --> 01:05:33,441
I'll have the cheese platter
now as well. Yes, and could you
save me the Nesselrode pie?

1132
01:05:33,509 --> 01:05:35,409
Lovely.
Thank you.

1133
01:05:37,547 --> 01:05:40,607
[ Narrating ] October 12.
We opened in Boston.

1134
01:05:40,683 --> 01:05:43,345
Ellen came up for it.
Mr. Valenti was there.

1135
01:05:43,419 --> 01:05:46,616
It went well, although my heart's
in my mouth every time Olive speaks.

1136
01:05:46,689 --> 01:05:51,422
Don't tell me you still think
the world revolves around--

1137
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:53,826
- [ Whispering ] "You"!
- You.

1138
01:05:53,896 --> 01:05:56,831
I saw Max Gordon in the lobby.
He loved it!

1139
01:05:56,899 --> 01:06:00,960
- [ General Chatter ]
- David, did you know
that I have a train to catch?

1140
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:05,337
- Hey, Dave, how was l?
- Wonderful. You finished
that whole speech this time.

1141
01:06:05,408 --> 01:06:07,467
- Yeah, I did, didn't l?
- And much improved.

1142
01:06:07,543 --> 01:06:11,502
You know, Olive was good.
She still needs work, but--
Hey, Charlie, how are ya?

1143
01:06:11,581 --> 01:06:13,515
[ David ] The first act seems
to be working well.

1144
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:18,384
- I got some flowers for ya.
- Oh, a hundred orchids!
They could only be from Billy Rose.

1145
01:06:18,454 --> 01:06:22,686
Yes. They are! They're from Billy.
Oh, they're beautiful.

1146
01:06:22,759 --> 01:06:25,455
And you!
Oh! Fabulous.

1147
01:06:25,528 --> 01:06:29,055
Oh, thank you so much.
So sweet of you. [ Kissing ]

1148
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:32,860
Listen, let me go and get changed, and
then I'll meet you at the Lobster Grill.

1149
01:06:32,935 --> 01:06:35,699
Could you order me
the shore dinner as an appetizer?

1150
01:06:35,772 --> 01:06:37,706
And I'll have roast beef
as the main course.

1151
01:06:37,774 --> 01:06:41,608
- How come you didn't
call me over the weekend?
- Oh, you were great.

1152
01:06:41,644 --> 01:06:44,374
- I was busy, my dear. I'm busy now.
- Oh, really?

1153
01:06:44,447 --> 01:06:47,439
- Excuse me. Could I just
have a word with you?
- No, my friends are up from town.

1154
01:06:47,517 --> 01:06:51,510
- We're just going to eat,
and I've got to get changed.
- You don't mind if we talk.

1155
01:06:51,587 --> 01:06:53,646
- We'll wait for you.
- We'll just be a second.

1156
01:06:53,723 --> 01:06:58,353
- Oh, well, I'll be with you
in two seconds.
- Bye.

- I can't be here. I mustn't--
- When I saw you on stage,
doing that big speech...

1158

- Olive, I'm very tempted.
You're a gorgeous girl.
- you were so, so sexy.

1159
01:07:08,304 --> 01:07:11,330
- I mustn't be seen with you.
- What the hell is this?
A corset? Get it off.

- Don't!
- What, what, what?
What are you so nervous about?

- I can't be seen with you.
He threatened to kill me.
- Who threatened to kill you?

1162
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:21,847
- Cheech.
- Cheech threatened to kill you?

1163
01:07:21,884 --> 01:07:24,876
Well, how do ya like that?
He finally got wise.

1164
01:07:24,954 --> 01:07:28,014
You know what? I wouldn't let it
worry you if I were you.

1165
01:07:28,057 --> 01:07:31,720
You're not the type to let some
strong-arm gorilla push you around.

1166
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:35,753
Olive, essentially, I'm an actor. I take
on certain roles that require of me--

1167
01:07:35,832 --> 01:07:39,734
You weren't just an actor
when you were taking my underwear off.
You were a big shot.

1168
01:07:39,802 --> 01:07:43,829
You were sayin' to me,
"Olive, I have big plans for you.
I want you to star with me.

1169
01:07:43,906 --> 01:07:46,670
- Stop it. Listen, Olive--
- I make my own rules.

1170
01:07:46,743 --> 01:07:48,870
All this is true,
but we must be realistic.

1171
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:53,610
- Realistic?
- God, I'm starving!
Do you have a sticky bun or--

1172
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:56,413
[ Knock At Door ]
Open up. It's me, Nick.

1173

- I'm dressing.
- Ah, c'mon. I ain't gonna see

- I'm coming, I'm coming.
Hold your water.

- Hi, baby.
- Ah, there you are.

- You were swell in
the show tonight, Olive.
- Well, thank you.

- I thought so. Wasn't she, boys?
- Oh, yeah.

1179

- What a thrill.
- Come on. Get yourself dressed.

- We got time to grab a drink
before I drive back to New York.
- Well, I don't know.

1181
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:25,646
- Not tonight, Nickie.
I'm a little bit tired.
- Come on, come on.

You been puttin' me off
for weeks now.

- I'm a little bit tired.
- Since when you too tired
to shovel in a little booze?

the show went quite well, don't you?

Oh, excuse me, Mr. Valenti.
Darling, could you give me that
cue a little quicker in Act ll?

1186
01:08:39,629 --> 01:08:42,723
You know the one where your character
is quoting Hamlet?

Oh, well, you know, it's hard,
'cause I always forget the second part.

Yes, I know.
It's "or not to be." Okay?

1189
01:08:49,572 --> 01:08:52,803
Because I can't come in until you
finish your line, and I go "ooh."

- To be--
- Or not to be.

way the audience applauded your exit?

and not the upstage wall.

- What's he barkin' at?

01:09:25,475 --> 01:09:28,535
- I think you were talkin'
about the broad.
- All right, party's over.

1201
01:09:28,611 --> 01:09:30,977
Come on, guys. Get outta here.
I gotta change.

1202
01:09:31,047 --> 01:09:33,811
Nickie, you too.
One drink, all right? Let me change.

1203
01:09:33,883 --> 01:09:36,750
- So who's this Hamlet guy?
- Come on. Outta here.

1204
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:38,980
- Go on, go on.
- Does he live around here?

1205
01:09:39,055 --> 01:09:42,456
Hamlet. That's really
funny, honey. Bye.

Go on! Get outta here. They're gone.

No, no, no! Not that way.

Go on. The window.

1210
01:09:53,002 --> 01:09:55,800
I'll be out
in a minute, Nick.

1211
01:10:02,245 --> 01:10:05,578
-Oh, my goodness. Warner! Hello, Warner.
-It was a lovely performance.

1212
01:10:05,648 --> 01:10:09,175
- Oh, thank you very much.
That's sweet of you.
- We enjoyed it so much.

1213
01:10:09,252 --> 01:10:11,982
- Oh, yes, well, did you like the play?
- I loved the play.

1214
01:10:12,054 --> 01:10:14,887
- It's a smashing part.
- The second act was wonderful.

1215
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:17,687
- Beautiful scene.
- It's lovely working
with Helen, of course.

1216
01:10:17,727 --> 01:10:20,821
- She's so good. She's just lovely.
- She just carries one through.

1217
01:10:20,863 --> 01:10:22,922
Could you possibly
give me an autograph?

1218
01:10:22,999 --> 01:10:26,662
- I-l'd love to.
I don't have a pen on me.
- Oh, you don't?

1219
01:10:26,736 --> 01:10:30,866
It's her. That's what it is. I can't
keep turnin' a blind eye. It's Olive.

1220
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,908
She's better than
when we started.

1221
01:10:32,975 --> 01:10:36,604
- Sure, she's better.
That don't mean she's good enough.
- Well, I mean, you know--

1222
01:10:36,679 --> 01:10:38,943
- This is something
that just bothers you.
- Yeah.

1223
01:10:39,015 --> 01:10:43,076
- The critics-- Her notices were decent.
- Decent ain't good enough.

1224
01:10:43,152 --> 01:10:48,920
- She's killin' my words.
- Your words? Okay, she's
weaker, but it doesn't matter.

1225
01:10:48,991 --> 01:10:52,518
- Weak? I think she's doin'
more damage than you think.
- What am I gonna do, fire her?

1226
01:10:52,595 --> 01:10:54,654
- I can't have her ruinin' my show.
- Your show?

1227
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:58,063
- What are you talkin' about?
- All right, our show.

1228
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:01,001
- I put a lot into this.
It could be perfect.
- Yeah, so did l...

1229
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:03,004
but there's concessions
we have to make.

1230
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:06,041
- The show's a hit.
- She's not the best we could do
for the part.

1231
01:11:06,108 --> 01:11:09,771
- There's plenty other girls around.
- What are we gonna do, Cheech?

1232
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:12,575
She throws the whole thing
out of whack. Can't you see it?

1233
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:14,912
- The audience doesn't
know the difference.
- Oh, they know.

1234
01:11:14,984 --> 01:11:17,851
- They do not know.
- They don't know how to say it,
but they know.

1235
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,617
Every time I hear that voice,
it's like a knife in my fuckin' heart.
She can't act!

1236
01:11:21,691 --> 01:11:23,625
- You listening to me?
- Cheech, take a shower.

1237
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:27,060
She makes stuff not work. Stuff
she ain't even in comes out twisted.

1238
01:11:27,129 --> 01:11:30,895
- I can't fire her! You know this!
- Don't yell at me.

1239
01:11:30,933 --> 01:11:33,561
I am not yelling at you,
but you are too close to this.

1240
01:11:33,636 --> 01:11:35,365
Leave me alone.
I got a fuckin' headache.

1241
01:11:35,605 --> 01:11:37,766
- Leave me alone. I got a headache.
- You're being temperamental.

1242
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,865
Very temperamental!

[ Narrating ]
Fate acts in strange ways.

1244
01:11:42,078 --> 01:11:45,707
Everyone seems to be
feeling the pressure of
our upcoming New York opening.

1245
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:50,241
Yesterday, Warner got into a
fight with Eden, and the results
proved Cheech right yet again.

1246
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:54,085
There you are. Mr. Purcell,
you have been stealing our
dog yummies and eating them.

1247
01:11:54,123 --> 01:11:56,353
Absolutely not.
That's an outrageous suggestion.

1248
01:11:56,592 --> 01:11:59,186
- Then let me see in your pockets.
- Would I eat dog food?

1249
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:02,788
You'd eat anything that didn't eat
you first, you big fat pot of helium.

1250
01:12:02,832 --> 01:12:05,596
- This is the sort of food I eat:
prime loin chop.
- Let me see.

1251
01:12:05,668 --> 01:12:09,229
I do not steal from animals. Get out
of my trousers, you horrid woman.

1252
01:12:09,305 --> 01:12:11,796
Look!
Oh, thief, thief, thief!

1253
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:14,104
It was you that drank
her saucer of milk yesterday.

Ow! Ow!
You fat hunk of blubber!

1255

- She pushed me!
- Ow, my hand! That's 'cause
you were stealin' her dog food.

1256
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:25,684
Somebody ought to stick
a harpoon in you, you big whale.

1257

- Ow.
- I can get you a doctor.
I can get you a doctor.

1258
01:12:28,357 --> 01:12:30,325
I guess this means
you'll miss the matinee.

It's okay with me.
One show a day is plenty.

1260
01:12:33,262 --> 01:12:35,753
To think I didn't
believe you at first, you dear--

1261
01:12:35,831 --> 01:12:40,632
I think I can say this in the company
of-- in the company of all of you.

1262
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:45,801
That a woman of your age
should have leapt past the realm
of such acute narcissism.

1263
01:12:54,383 --> 01:12:56,943
- What a difference with
a real actress saying those lines!
- All right.

- The whole play came to life!
- Listen to me.

Don't get carried away.
Don't get any ideas. Olive is going on.

We can get all the backing
we need without Nick Valenti.
Our notices are wonderful.

- It's not the money. I told ya that.

at the bottom of the Hudson.

He'll kill us here in Boston.
We'll be at the bottom of the Charles.

He was right. She wrecks the whole play.
He noticed that.

1271

- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. It's just that
she affects the whole play.

- [ David ] You were wonderful.
- Yes, yes. Wonderful.

is welsh on Nick Valenti.
- On Nick Valenti.

- In future productions,
we can hire somebody else.
- Shh-shh!

We can hire somebody else, but if she's
okay to open in New York, she opens.

for air, trying to find its own life...

is working with Olive's understudy.
- Mmm, Olive.

You look a little flushed.

- Is it something I said?

do you fall in love with

-Because there's nothing to tell, Ellen.

be happier back in Pittsburgh.

- Yeah. Yes. Get to the point.

You are wracked with guilt.

- An artist creates
his own moral universe.
- I know that. I know--

1345
01:17:44,139 --> 01:17:48,075
Well? What is the problem then?
I'm gonna give you some advice.

1346
01:17:48,143 --> 01:17:52,477
The same advice that was
given to me many years ago when
I had a very similar dilemma.

- Similar to mine. To--
- Yes. Yes.

Listen, when she gets here, tell her
you're gonna give her some new lines.

- You know, like we discussed.
- Yeah.

Let me level with you, Mr. V.
Do you mind if I call you Nick?

1362

You see, Nick, you don't
fiddle with a winning show.

you're finished.

You can't distort the plot.

Changes could be harmful.

- Sure.

or I'll nail your kneecaps
to the dance floor.

1371

Imagine that director telling me
I'm overacting in the first scene...

01:19:10,192 --> 01:19:12,319
and I don't know
what I'm saying.

I wanna throw that in when
Sylvia threatens to leave,
and then I burst into tears.

Well, you know, he says no,
but what the hell kind of dull
show is he putting on anyway?

We have to go pick up Nick.

We're gonna pick up Nick? You never
said nothin' about picking him up.

- We just gotta meet him--
- I thought we were gonna
meet him at the club.

dowdy, brown, ugly dresses?
I don't understand--

Yeah, we are.
Nick's got a surprise for ya.

1384
01:20:00,576 --> 01:20:03,136
- Nick's got a surprise for me?
- Yeah, come on.

1385
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:07,205
Come with me. You're gonna really like
it. This cost Nick a lot of dough to--

1386
01:20:07,282 --> 01:20:11,150
- To do this for you. Come on.
- I don't-- I don't like this.

1387
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:15,418
I don't like this, Cheech.
I can't understand why Nick has
a surprise for me in a warehouse.

1388
01:20:15,491 --> 01:20:17,550
He's not treatin' me
like a lady.

1389

-He's got a moonlight cruise.
-A moonlight cruise? I don't understand.

1390
01:20:21,597 --> 01:20:24,122
- Just walk right over there.
Go ahead. He's over there.
- I don't--

- Just walk over there. Olive!
- Nickie?

We tried calling her,
but there was no answer.

1400
01:20:49,424 --> 01:20:52,621
It's possible her understudy might
have to do tomorrow's show.

- Maybe Olive's got stage fright.
Maybe she won't show.
- Not Olive.

is relational, that it requires two--

the artist
and the audience?

- About-- About sex?

01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:18,361
Yes, between the two right people,
it can become an art form.

Are you saying that you and
Flender have raised intercourse
to the level of an art form?

why you're so unhappy.

Yeah. It's all right.
We'll take care of those Kustabeck guys.

How come you didn't bring her
to me at the club, Cheech?

I should drop her off at the theater.

1643
01:34:51,499 --> 01:34:56,459
Y-You're all missing the point.
The point is, I can give
pleasure many times a day.

1644
01:34:56,537 --> 01:34:59,597
Oh, now really, Flender.
What has quantity got to do with it?

1645
01:34:59,674 --> 01:35:02,472
- Quantity affects quality.
- [ David ] Says who?

1646
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:05,377
- Karl Marx.
- [ Rita ] Oh, so now
we're talking economics.

1647
01:35:05,446 --> 01:35:09,075
- Sex is economics.
- Bullshit. Ellen, come down here.
I wanna talk to you.

1648
01:35:09,150 --> 01:35:12,278
I love you. I wanna see you.
Come down here.

1649
01:35:12,353 --> 01:35:15,322
- All right.
- What do you mean "All right"?
What about me?

1650
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:18,359
You're great, Flender, but it's no use.
I'll never get over David.

1651
01:35:18,393 --> 01:35:22,159
Couldn't you tell? Each time
I climaxed, I'd scream, "David! David!"

1652
01:35:22,196 --> 01:35:24,289
I thought you were saying,
"Do it! Do it!"

1653
01:35:24,365 --> 01:35:27,266
Flender, stop it.
Leave 'em alone.

1654
01:35:27,335 --> 01:35:29,667
Can't you see
they love each other?

1655
01:35:34,375 --> 01:35:37,469
I'm finished with it:
living in the garrets...

1656
01:35:37,545 --> 01:35:41,481
eating cheese and drinking wine
and analyzing art in coffee houses.

1657
01:35:41,549 --> 01:35:44,074
It's over.
I love you.

1658
01:35:44,152 --> 01:35:47,178
- I want us to get married.
We'll go back to Pittsburgh.
- But you're a success.

1659
01:35:47,255 --> 01:35:50,053
- You have a hit. Why the sudden change?
- We'll have kids.

1660
01:35:50,124 --> 01:35:53,491
- Because I've wasted too much
time already. I love you.
- But you're an artist.

1661
01:35:53,561 --> 01:35:55,529
No, I'm not.
I'm not.

1662
01:35:55,596 --> 01:35:58,588
I'll explain it all to you on
the train back to Pittsburgh.

1663
01:35:58,633 --> 01:36:02,091
There's two things of which I'm certain.
One is that I love you.

1664
01:36:03,438 --> 01:36:05,565
Two is that
I'm not an artist.

1665
01:36:06,607 --> 01:36:09,041
There, I said it,
and I feel free.

1666
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:11,044
I'm not an artist.

1667
01:36:17,418 --> 01:36:19,386
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.
