1
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:19,818
Over the course of human history,

2
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:23,555
there have been questions... mysteries.

3
00:00:25,057 --> 00:00:28,860
Our world is filled with
things we can't explain

4
00:00:28,927 --> 00:00:32,631
and legends we've never even seen.

5
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:41,740
Yet there is one legend more
fascinating than the rest...

6
00:00:41,806 --> 00:00:45,743
a yuletide visitor from the North.

7
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,281
He flies through our skies undetected,

8
00:00:49,347 --> 00:00:53,452
and travels the globe on a magical sled.

9
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:57,856
We find presents beneath trees,

10
00:00:57,922 --> 00:01:00,526
stockings filled by an unseen hand.

11
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,764
He goes about his secret work

12
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,768
leaving not a single whisker of evidence.

13
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:12,671
We never see him, but he knows

14
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:15,774
if we've been naughty or nice.

15
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,350
Without proof... he is just a mystery.

16
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:34,860
Some dare question his very existence...

17
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:36,962
until now.

18
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:47,706
Hey, wait up!

19
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:50,943
Alex, we got reindeer poo!

20
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,924
Frozen yogurt... Dutch chocolate with...

21
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:09,494
nuts and raisins.

22
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:12,063
Definitely not reindeer poo.

23
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,666
Merry Christmas!

24
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,334
This is it, he's on the move.

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,802
You sure you're in focus?

26
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:19,671
Duh! Of course I'm in focus.

27
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:21,005
I know how to use a camera.

28
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:22,274
I'm not five.

29
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,410
You're eight. Exactly.

30
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:26,644
I'm Alex.

31
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:30,348
My sister Elizabeth is behind the camera.

32
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:33,652
We're at Pinebrooke Middle School
gathering pre-holiday intelligence.

33
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:36,021
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

34
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:41,860
Come on, follow me.

35
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:49,067
Um, I don't have proper authorization.

36
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:51,403
It's okay, it's for science.

37
00:02:58,209 --> 00:02:59,744
Come on, come on.

38
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:02,313
Ew, what are those things?

39
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,249
How do you sit on those?

40
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:05,951
Shh!

41
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:23,468
Principal Welch?

42
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:26,338
Elizabeth?

43
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:27,439
For reals?

44
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:30,842
My principal is Santa Claus?

45
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:31,676
Cut!

46
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:33,979
Every kid knows Santa...

47
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:36,348
Jolly, wears red, likes the carbs.

48
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:40,351
But aside from the Tim Allen
movies and seasonal TV specials,

49
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:44,021
what do we really know about our
plus-size visitor from the North?

50
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:46,558
I don't think anyone has ever seen

51
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,027
the real Santa Claus outside of Claymation.

52
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:53,431
He must be real. I follow his blog.

53
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:55,133
My brother saw him once!

54
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,904
He said his farts smell like candy canes!

55
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:02,975
I have doubts, serious doubts.

56
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:07,979
Yeah, I kind of look the other
way on Christmas Eve, you know?

57
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:09,781
Sure, he might commit a B&E or two,

58
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:12,083
but, um, his heart's in the right place.

59
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,186
Heard he got a makeover back in the '90s...

60
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:16,521
Shaved the beard,
hit the gym, dyed the hair.

61
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:19,257
Now walks among us undetected.

62
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:20,992
He could be anyone.

63
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,094
Ho, ho, ho!

64
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,295
Anyone.

65
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:28,066
Oh, he's totally real.

66
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,935
We have evidence. We have the pipe.

67
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:32,971
Santa's pipe, the one you used to see

68
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:34,773
in all the pictures, we got it.

69
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,741
Uh-huh, it's true.

70
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:39,710
Santa's pipe is our family's
most cherished heirloom.

71
00:04:39,777 --> 00:04:40,912
My uncle Charlie found it

72
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,480
sitting beside the Christmas tree

73
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:46,151
on Christmas morning a long time ago.

74
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:51,522
Uncle Charlie is totally the
coolest uncle that ever lived.

75
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:54,392
Yeah.

76
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:55,560
Back it up, back it up.

77
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:57,349
This baby is going to the moon.

78
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:03,068
Whoa. Oh! Charlie!

79
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:04,202
Everybody, run!

80
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,171
Scatter, scatter!

81
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:07,339
Run, run!

82
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:08,706
Trick or treat.

83
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,281
Yeah.

84
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:18,115
Don't use it on your brother.

85
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:18,950
Really?

86
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,718
There was this one Christmas,

87
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:24,956
Uncle Charlie gave me
the coolest gift ever.

88
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:27,225
Santa's pipe? For real?

89
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:28,693
Uncle Charlie,
you're giving me Santa's pipe?

90
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,528
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

91
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:34,398
I figured it was time to entrust
Santa's pipe to a true believer.

92
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:35,600
This is so awesome.

93
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,435
A genuine Santa Claus artifact.

94
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:40,372
It was the greatest
Christmas present I ever got.

95
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,775
I decided to share this incredible
evidence with the world.

96
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,878
In conclusion,
this pipe is irrefutable evidence...

97
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:48,146
That's not Santa's pipe!

98
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:50,448
It didn't go exactly as planned.

99
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:52,818
You can't handle the truth!

100
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:57,188
And that was just the beginning.

101
00:05:57,254 --> 00:06:00,325
My life spiraled into a
nightmare of yuletide pranks.

102
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,098
Nonbelievers and Kringle deniers
ridiculed what I knew to be true...

103
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:14,539
That Santa Claus does exist.

104
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:15,974
I just have to prove it.

105
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,543
Hey, Christmas boy!
You're gonna regret this!

106
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,311
He knows what you're doing!

107
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:21,946
Be good for goodness sake.

108
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:26,084
That's when I decided to put together...
the team.

109
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:31,456
Okay, state your name and expertise.

110
00:06:31,522 --> 00:06:33,658
Uh, I'm Zoey.

111
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:34,892
I'm a puker.

112
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,963
Not my title... just a nervous stomach.

113
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:40,632
Excuse me.

114
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:44,435
My expertise is coloring and decoupage,

115
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:45,703
but I'm better at coloring.

116
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,705
I mean your Santa Hunter expertise.

117
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:51,575
Oh. Mainly,
I hold the camera and push a red button.

118
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:53,577
I also bake the cookies.

119
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:58,283
I'm Richard, Alex's favorite
cousin and deputy Santa Smasher.

120
00:06:58,349 --> 00:06:59,618
It's "Santa Hunter."

121
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:00,952
Whatev, dude.

122
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:04,356
I'm skilled in ninjitsu,
bottle-rocketology,

123
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:07,959
and various forms of
improvisational camouflage.

124
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,329
Can't see me, huh? Can ya?

125
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:13,931
Uh, yeah, I can.

126
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:16,168
I'm the founder and president
of my middle school's

127
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:19,270
ghost hunting and
cryptozoological studies club.

128
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:22,040
I also happen to be Alex's favorite cousin.

129
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:25,043
So,
I borrowed some equipment for winter break.

130
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,647
Night vision... motion detectors...

131
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:31,816
a sound dish... a boat horn.

132
00:07:34,318 --> 00:07:35,286
How about now?

133
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:37,088
Yeah, I still see you over there.

134
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:39,857
What does that have to do
with scientific investigation?

135
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:42,060
It's a boat horn.

136
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,663
Sure, I have questions,

137
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,966
like why stuff candy in smelly old socks?

138
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:50,135
What's that about? Gross.

139
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:52,871
You can't consume that
many cookies in one night

140
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:56,107
without incurring serious
digestive ramifications.

141
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:57,309
Observe.

142
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:05,183
That's 7,630,000 cookie
calories in New Jersey alone,

143
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:06,984
and that doesn't even count the milk.

144
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:09,054
That's not human. Do the math.

145
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:16,261
Maybe he steals the toys like
some Christmas Robin Hood.

146
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:21,132
If he's stealing, he should be exposed...
and squashed!

147
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,534
Hiya!

148
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:25,070
Aah...

149
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:26,271
Mom!

150
00:08:27,905 --> 00:08:29,741
Only comes out at night,

151
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:32,677
lives forever, commands flying animals.

152
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:35,180
Yep, totes vampire.

153
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:37,349
Just a theory. It doesn't make him bad.

154
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:38,216
I don't judge.

155
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:39,517
He could be the sparkly kind,

156
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,863
or maybe he only sucks the blood

157
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,788
of bullies or vice principals or hipsters.

158
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,291
Where's Richard, huh?

159
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:47,391
Seriously?

160
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,161
This Christmas, all I want is one thing...

161
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:53,031
To know there's something
worth believing in...

162
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:54,899
and DNA evidence.

163
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,802
We are the "Santa Hunters."

164
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,794
Our whole family gets
together every Christmas.

165
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:25,696
This year, the party is at our house.

166
00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:29,767
Our mission...
obtain irrefutable video evidence of Santa.

167
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,302
There he is.

168
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:33,238
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, sweetie. Love you.

169
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:35,707
A Claus encounter of the third kind.

170
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:37,408
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

171
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:39,410
Hey, Richard,
you're really rocking that bow tie.

172
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:43,147
I'd wear a tutu if it got
me a go-kart for Christmas.

173
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:46,451
Hey, a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

174
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:49,421
Men's underpants!

175
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:51,990
In my size.

176
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:57,528
All right, all right, who's number 12?

177
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:59,597
Zoey.

178
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:00,632
Nothin' to see here.

179
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,468
Just, uh, hanging ornaments.

180
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,871
Wait! Who wants eggnog!

181
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:08,840
Charlie!

182
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:11,475
Sorry we're late.
We almost didn't make it with all the snow.

183
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:12,811
Sis!

184
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:17,348
I didn't know that you
were bringing a friend.

185
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:18,716
More like hostage.

186
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:21,786
Yes, this is Natasha.

187
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:23,922
Nice to meet... Oh!

188
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:27,926
We're soul mates.

189
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,664
I mean, she really is the whole package.

190
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,199
She's smart, she's sophisticated,

191
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:36,567
eats pizza with a fork. Ah.

192
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:39,737
It's a serious relationship...
very, very grown-up. Mm-hmm.

193
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:43,374
Ooh! Even got a tattoo of
Natasha's favorite animal.

194
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,275
Oh!

195
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:46,077
Yeah, I know.

196
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:47,612
That's exactly how she reacted.

197
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:49,647
But I figured everybody loves unicorns,
right?

198
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:51,048
Oh, sure, sure, of course.

199
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:53,151
You know what? We are
just glad you're here.

200
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:55,587
We're going to, uh,
put you in Elizabeth's room.

201
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:57,621
Ah, yeah. Hope you don't mind bunk beds.

202
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:58,823
Hey!

203
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,624
You know what? No, no, no, we can't stay.

204
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:03,727
Um, Natasha booked a room at
the Pinebrooke Resort and Spa.

205
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:06,330
We're gonna be spending Christmas
Day getting couples waxed.

206
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:07,598
What?

207
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,265
Wow. Well, the kids will be disappointed.

208
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,035
Yeah, yeah, you know, Natasha's not really

209
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:13,871
a big kids person.

210
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:17,575
She's violently allergic to
Christmas trees and... and kids.

211
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:21,512
She's from Moosplaskistan.

212
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:22,981
Yeah, it's Eastern Europe.

213
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,517
They got weird stuff over there.

214
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,185
Ooh, almost forgot.

215
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:30,288
Got a couple presents for the kids.

216
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,323
Charlie... It's not much.

217
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,593
You know, I'm kind of
employment-challenged at the moment.

218
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,820
I had a couple of unfortunate
alarm clock malfunctions.

219
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:39,931
Turns out that doughnut
shops place a high priority

220
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:41,833
on waking up before... Before noonish.

221
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,201
I like to... Oh, Charlie.

222
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:45,103
No, no, no, it's good.

223
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,371
Just had to sell my comic
book collection and my...

224
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:50,040
My vintage action figures, but, um...

225
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:51,976
But, you know, it's all part of the...

226
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:53,778
The Charlie reboot, Charlie 2.0.

227
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:56,914
Well, 2.0 or 1.0,
we're just glad you're here.

228
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,215
Thanks.

Where are you kids going?

240
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:34,685
Uh, we're going... caroling.

241
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:35,820
In the backyard?

242
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:37,722
Uh... For squirrels.

243
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:38,856
Squirrels.

244
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:40,090
Oh, all right.

245
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:42,435
Come on, guys, let's go to the tree house.

246
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:48,867
All right. Okay.

247
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:50,501
Zoey will be on the second floor.

248
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:53,171
I'll be by the secondary
tree in the family room.

249
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:56,707
Elizabeth and Richard will be...

250
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:59,110
Okay, guys, who ate Richard?

251
00:12:59,176 --> 00:13:02,113
I did it. I confess.

252
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,583
I ate myself... for security reasons.

253
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,519
And I tasted good.

254
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:12,923
Zoey and I preset a few
strategic stationary cameras.

255
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:24,502
Hey.

256
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:30,808
Oh!

257
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,281
Once Santa's in the nest,

258
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:39,516
all exterior access will be locked down.

259
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,285
We sealed the windows earlier today.

260
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:43,188
Well...

261
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:55,466
Would you cut it out with the toys, please?

262
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,901
It's a drone. I'm a woman of science.

263
00:13:57,968 --> 00:14:00,070
I don't play with toys.

264
00:14:00,137 --> 00:14:02,273
All footage will be wirelessly transmitted

265
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:03,674
back to the command center

266
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:06,578
and stored on a field-ready
digital video recorder

267
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:08,479
much like the one we have here.

268
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:11,215
It's the same one they used on
"Sasquatch Stalkers."

269
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,150
Are we gonna be much longer?

270
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:14,586
I have to wee-wee.

271
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,256
There's cameras in each
of the first-floor rooms,

272
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:22,259
the foyer, the chandelier,
and in the Christmas tree.

273
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:23,494
Ho, ho, ho!

274
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:25,662
Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho?

275
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,498
Isn't it too early for a "ho, ho, ho"?
Ho, ho, ho!

276
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:31,602
Um... uh,
according to the "Sleigh-Dar" Santa Chaser,

277
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:35,072
uh, he should be around North Africa.

278
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:36,874
It's definitely not Santa.

279
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:39,209
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

280
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:40,944
Alpine stations, people.

281
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:42,680
Go, go, go, go, go!

282
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:48,619
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

283
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:54,225
Oh, man, the old tree
house is looking good.

284
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:56,193
Oh, uh, Mom wants you
kids back in the house

285
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,660
because Grandpa's about to break out

286
00:14:57,662 --> 00:15:00,097
"'Twas the Night Before Christmas."

287
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:02,867
Oh... wow, look at that.

288
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:06,637
You kids planning a toy store heist?

289
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:10,942
No, we're just playing,
um, the, uh, Ginger Games.

290
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:14,011
Yeah, uh,
gingerbread men fight to the death.

291
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,614
Loser gets eaten.

292
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:18,849
Guys, we can tell Uncle Charlie.

293
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,251
He's one of us.

294
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:21,519
He's a true believer.

295
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:23,153
We're on a top-secret mission.

296
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,155
We're hunting San...

297
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,791
Charlie!

298
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:28,759
Oh, hey, snoopy-poopy!

299
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:30,361
You gotta come up here and
check out this tree house.

300
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:31,696
It is awesome.

301
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:34,198
I built this baby with my own two hands.

302
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:35,399
I can fix that.

303
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,802
I am not coming up there!

304
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:39,069
It's time to go.

305
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:41,205
I feel an infection coming on.

306
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:42,273
Okay, give... Give me a minute.

307
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:43,499
I'll come down, and we can...

308
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,109
We can talk about it, all right?

309
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:47,578
I miss you,<i> milaya moya.</i>

310
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:51,949
That's Moosplakistanian for "my sweet."

311
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:53,250
Or maybe it's "my stink."

312
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:55,653
I'm not real strong with the language.

313
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,288
Playtime's over!

314
00:15:57,354 --> 00:15:59,023
Grown men don't play in house in trees!

315
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,023
But, baby...

316
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,725
Come down here now

317
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:05,763
before disease-infested
brats breathe germs on you.

318
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,365
Wow,
sounds like somebody needs to be visited

319
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:11,635
by the Ghost of Christmas Past,
Present, and Future.

320
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:13,004
All right, I'm coming down.

321
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,405
I gotta...

322
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:16,986
Merry Christmas, everybody.

323
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,243
Merry Christmas, Uncle Charlie.

324
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,645
Coming, baby.

325
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:25,816
When out on the lawn
there rose such a clatter,

326
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:29,420
I sprang from my bed to
see what was the matter.

327
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:32,656
Away to the window I flew like a flash,

328
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:35,959
tore open the shutters,
and threw up the sash.

329
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:39,496
The moon on the breast
of the new-fallen snow

330
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:42,967
gave the luster of midday to objects below.

331
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,548
Merry, merry Christmas.
You guys drive very safe...

332
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:52,643
So...

333
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:55,579
you kids must be all
excited about Santa coming.

334
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:58,035
Is that happening tonight?
What's Christmas?

335
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,918
I'm just really tired.

336
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:05,456
Well, off to bed.

337
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:07,992
Good night. Good night.

338
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:09,594
Merry Christmas.

339
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,829
Merry Christmas, guys.

340
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:20,972
Shh.

341
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,411
Hi.

342
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:30,715
Yeah.

343
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:34,519
Parent alert.

344
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,955
Come on, guys.

345
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:58,810
It's go time.

346
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:02,814
Let's do this.

347
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:15,927
Yeah.

348
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:18,830
Make sure you wear these at all times.

349
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:21,365
It's got a wireless spy
cam affixed to the base.

350
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,267
The earpiece is voice-controlled.

351
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,369
Make sure your body cams are on.

352
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:31,275
What is that?

353
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:32,443
It's my tiara cam.

354
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:35,079
It's functional... and super cute.

355
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,349
Locked and loaded, chief.

356
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,085
30 rounds of glow-in-the-dark paintballs.

357
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:42,720
Tag Santa with one of these

358
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,922
and he won't be able to hide in the dark.

359
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:47,792
You're definitely gonna shoot your eye out.

360
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,996
Wireless hard drive is a 5-by-5, chief.

361
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:56,600
Everything as of right now is
being streamed and recorded.

362
00:18:56,667 --> 00:19:00,371
All right, team, hunting season starts now.

363
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:06,610
Dining room cam, nothing.

364
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:09,546
Tree cam, boring.

365
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:12,783
Kitchen cam, nothing.

366
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:17,654
Aquarium cam... fish bubbles and fish poop.

367
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:19,357
And I've spun too much.

368
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:29,600
Living room's clear.

369
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:33,437
Slayer II in position.

370
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:35,506
You're not Slayer II. We discussed this.

371
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:37,341
Roger that, boss man.

372
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:38,642
Roger?

373
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,845
If he can be Roger, I wanna be Ariel.

374
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:45,015
Nobody's gonna be Ariel
or Roger or Slayer II.

375
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:48,719
This is science, people...
Normal names, science.

376
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:50,688
Cut it out! Tyrant.

377
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:53,824
How can I make science
with all this dysfunction?

378
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,495
Launching drone.

379
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:02,900
Okay, we're clear, no UFOs.

380
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:05,102
I'm going to set her down on the roof.

381
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:14,579
That explains his breath.

382
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:19,717
Whoa! Alex, I got something!

383
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,385
What?<i> What is it?</i>

384
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:22,519
A... A present.

385
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:24,154
Upstairs, laundry room.

386
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:25,522
It wasn't there before.

387
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:27,091
<i>What? What are you waiting for?</i>

388
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:29,460
You're the only one who
isn't guarding a perimeter.

389
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:31,328
You've gotta check it out.

390
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:32,596
What if it's a trap?

391
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,264
Zoey, man up.

392
00:20:34,331 --> 00:20:35,666
You got this.

393
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:40,671
Ow!

394
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:51,549
Hm.

395
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:52,950
Whoa!

396
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,093
Zoey, what do you got?

397
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,999
A box...
a big, weird, creepy box with a bow.

398
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:10,100
I'm going in.

399
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:11,235
Zoey!

400
00:21:12,936 --> 00:21:16,240
What's in the box, Zoey? What's in the box?

401
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:21,879
You should've seen your face.

402
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,481
Ha, ha.

403
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:26,417
Ow! Ow!

404
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:27,852
Ow, that hurts!

405
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:29,920
You're lucky I don't
wanna wake the parents up,

406
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:32,222
or I'd really give you
something to scream about.

407
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:34,190
Zoey, stop killing Richard.

408
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:36,160
Ow!

409
00:21:36,226 --> 00:21:37,695
Get back here.

410
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:40,665
<i>We got a bogey on the second-floor hallway.</i>

411
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,002
Go, go, go!

412
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:53,644
Santa?

413
00:21:57,781 --> 00:22:00,017
<i>Code gray... I repeat, code gray.</i>

414
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,219
<i>Grandpa's headed right at you.</i>

415
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,367
She's trapped.

416
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:26,509
Ohh...

417
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:27,611
Ew!

418
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:31,748
This is gonna be bad.

419
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:34,752
Grandpa ate three bowls of
Aunt Carol's Christmas chili.

420
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:37,922
It's burning my eyes.

421
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:42,059
Ooh! Ooh.

422
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:45,496
<i>I don't wanna die like this.</i>

423
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:46,964
We gotta get her out of there.

424
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:50,267
We can't compromise the mission.

425
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,702
<i>I don't think I can ever hug Grandpa again.</i>

426
00:22:57,107 --> 00:22:59,977
Hang in there, soldier. Be strong.

427
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:03,114
None of us signed up for
biological warfare.

428
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:15,125
Oh, my gosh!

429
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:18,562
That smells. That smells.
That smells. That smells.

430
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:19,730
That smells.

431
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:21,665
Zoey, talk to me. Talk to me.

432
00:23:21,732 --> 00:23:24,168
That smells. That smells. That smells.

433
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:32,442
I need to shower and bathe
and power-wash my eyeballs.

434
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:35,012
Ew! Now, the smell's on me!

435
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:40,017
What?

436
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:44,821
That's sector three...

437
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:47,057
Outside window above the porch.

438
00:23:47,123 --> 00:23:49,392
Visualize the gingerbread, people.

439
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:52,163
It's him. He's here.

440
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,135
We've got nothing on surveillance.

441
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:02,940
He's coming up the stairs.

442
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:09,079
Look, he's in my room.

443
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:10,448
Lights!

444
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:13,717
Time for...

445
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:16,086
Lobo cam, yeah.

446
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,925
Lobo cam inserted.

447
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:22,927
We've got movement.

448
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:27,865
It's in my bed.

449
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:29,399
Why does it have to be in<i> my</i> bed?

450
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:32,870
Those sheets are 10,000
thread-count Egyptian cotton.

451
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:34,104
Stay on target.

452
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:37,307
Richard, recon. Zoey, you're my eyes.

453
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:47,852
What are you?

454
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:58,895
Natasha! What is go...

455
00:24:58,962 --> 00:25:00,764
What... No, no, no. It's a toy.

456
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:02,399
<i>Honey hugs, it's a toy.</i>

457
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:04,834
<i>It's... Look. It's... Look. It's just a...</i>

458
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,236
<i>It's just a nice little toy.</i>

459
00:25:06,303 --> 00:25:07,204
<i>Look at that.</i>

460
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,073
Who is behind this sick joke?

461
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,009
What's happening? Talk to me. Zoey!

462
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:14,678
Mission compromised. Fall back! Fall back!

463
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:19,383
What the figgy pudding
is going on out here?

464
00:25:19,449 --> 00:25:21,049
You scared Natasha halfway to Arbor Day.

465
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,420
Charlie, is that you?

466
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:25,255
Please don't bust us, Uncle Charlie.

467
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:26,823
I can explain.

468
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,859
Uh, yeah, it's just us, Mom.

469
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,961
Uh, the roads were icy, so we came back.

470
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:32,228
Safety first.

471
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:33,530
I heard screaming.

472
00:25:33,597 --> 00:25:35,966
Yeah, that was, uh...
That was just Natasha.

473
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:38,569
Yeah, yeah, Grandpa forgot to flush again.

474
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:41,004
Okay, glad you came back, honey.

475
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,506
All right. Night, Ma.

476
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:43,908
Thank you.

477
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:50,914
Look at what their hijinks has done.

478
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:52,149
I'm breaking out in hives.

479
00:25:52,216 --> 00:25:53,717
It's... it's okay, snoogy-woogy.

480
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:54,944
It's... it's okay. Calm down.

481
00:25:54,984 --> 00:25:56,220
I'll handle the kids.

482
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:58,022
This is how you handle kids.

483
00:25:58,088 --> 00:26:00,424
Everyone to bed. You're grounded.

484
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,626
You can't ground us.

485
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:04,327
You don't have jurisdiction.

486
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:08,998
I'm an adult. I have implied powers.

487
00:26:09,065 --> 00:26:10,867
No food, one month.

488
00:26:12,235 --> 00:26:14,738
Wanna make it two? Okay, okay, hang on.

489
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:16,473
Hang on, snookums.

490
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,475
I'm sure the kids have a good reason

491
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,062
for whatever it is that they're doing.

492
00:26:20,076 --> 00:26:24,581
We're conducting research.
Supernatural research.

493
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:25,849
Search and destroy.

494
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:28,284
We're on a Santa hunt.

495
00:26:28,351 --> 00:26:30,287
A Santa hunt?

496
00:26:30,353 --> 00:26:31,354
Coolness.

497
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:34,124
They're going... Nuh, hm... Yeah, no.

498
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:37,294
You can't hunt Santa. The man's unhuntable.

499
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:39,362
He's gone decades without getting caught.

500
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:41,098
Ooh, he's probably rocking some,

501
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:43,266
you know, some stealth technology or,
like, a...

502
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,969
Like,
a sled-cloaking device that no one can see.

503
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:48,438
Santa is a sham.

504
00:26:49,873 --> 00:26:51,342
Blasphemy!

505
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:53,643
You don't know what you're talking about,
lady.

506
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:59,249
<i>Oh, ho, ho, I know exactly
what I am talking about, child.</i>

507
00:26:59,316 --> 00:27:01,518
When Natasha was just a little girl,

508
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:05,155
she had one simple
request for Santa Claus...

509
00:27:05,222 --> 00:27:08,325
A beautiful, pink princess doll.

510
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:11,761
Natasha was a good girl, very good.

511
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:13,530
Did she get what she wanted?

512
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:15,599
I'm gonna guess...

513
00:27:15,665 --> 00:27:18,301
No! No, of course not!

514
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:23,640
Natasha found another doll
under the tree instead...

515
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:24,975
Military Mike.

516
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:26,810
Awesome toy! Sweet!

517
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:30,113
No, not sweet! Unsweetened.

518
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,749
I was the laughingstock of my village.

519
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:38,255
I blame this Santa Claus for my shame.

520
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:39,923
He owes me. Shame...

521
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:43,660
Kids, it's late.

522
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:46,563
But, Uncle Charlie,
we've got a real shot at this.

523
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,575
You're the reason for this
mission in the first place.

524
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:52,569
Remember?

525
00:27:55,138 --> 00:27:57,240
Oh, yeah. We've got an extra headset.

526
00:27:57,307 --> 00:27:59,743
We could use another true
believer on the team.

527
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,878
Yeah.

528
00:28:01,945 --> 00:28:04,414
Santa, you're not gonna get away... Uh, no.

529
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,918
Look, you know what?
I am... I'm an adult, okay?

530
00:28:07,985 --> 00:28:09,319
Charlie 2.0.

531
00:28:09,386 --> 00:28:11,554
I'm just gonna...
All right, merry Christmas.

532
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:12,899
I'm coming. I'm coming.

533
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,698
You guys get all that?

534
00:28:21,765 --> 00:28:23,133
Yeah, ow.

535
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:26,870
I never wanna end up on
Natasha's naughty list.

536
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:28,217
Maybe Uncle Charlie has a point.

537
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:30,073
Maybe we just can't hunt Santa.

538
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,241
I'm getting a little tired anyways,

539
00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:34,477
and we have a big day ahead of us,

540
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:37,147
a day filled with presents and food.

541
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:40,884
Yeah. And did I mention
it's all about the presents?

542
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:44,354
Well, presents and... candy.

543
00:28:46,156 --> 00:28:50,994
Are you all forgetting the
whole purpose of this mission?

544
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:52,929
It's to prove to people like that,

545
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:55,164
the nonbelievers, that they're wrong.

546
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:57,934
It was a good try, Alex, really good,

547
00:28:58,001 --> 00:28:59,903
but it's time to shut it down

548
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,604
and take a long winter's nap.

549
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:03,006
Agreed.

550
00:29:03,073 --> 00:29:04,608
Sorry, Alex.

551
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:07,043
Mission aborted.

552
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,480
Fine... go to bed.

553
00:29:09,546 --> 00:29:13,283
Enjoy your dreams of sugarplum fairies.

554
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:17,987
If I gotta go lone wolf...
I'll go lone wolf.

555
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:20,357
I'm gonna see this thing through.

556
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,793
What's going on?

557
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:28,532
Christmas! It's happening. It's happening!

558
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,133
He's here.

559
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,002
I don't hear any foot...

560
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:34,403
Come on, guys, let's go!

561
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:40,943
The cookies, they're gone!

562
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,580
Lock it down. Lock it down now! Let's go!

563
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:49,086
Chimney secure. Repeat, chimney secure.

564
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:56,226
Front door secure.

565
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:00,197
Backdoor secure.

566
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:02,099
Windows are still glued shut.

567
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:03,734
Hunters, we have complete lockdown.

568
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,435
<i>If he's here, he's trapped.</i>

569
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:08,772
Whoa, whoa!

570
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,507
Zoey, talk to me.

571
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:12,376
We got a "Black Hawk Down"
sitch on the roof.

572
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:15,645
A what? Vixen is eating my drone!

573
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:17,848
That's an expensive piece of equipment,

574
00:30:17,914 --> 00:30:19,483
and I don't have a gift receipt.

575
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,118
<i>Hunters to battle stations.</i>

576
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,386
This is real world, people, not a drill.

577
00:30:23,453 --> 00:30:26,590
<i>Creature is stirring.
Repeat, creature is stirring.</i>

578
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:35,732
Santa tracks.

579
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:36,833
Code red, people.

580
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,368
<i>We've got him.</i>

581
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:45,309
<i>Checking the tree.</i>

582
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:50,380
No gifts, stockings empty.

583
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,216
Looks like he hasn't been here.

584
00:30:56,486 --> 00:30:57,621
What?

585
00:31:11,802 --> 00:31:13,282
What do you see, Santa One?

586
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:14,771
<i>Santa One, do you copy?</i>

587
00:31:14,837 --> 00:31:17,741
<i>Santa One, do you see any more tracks?</i>

588
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:21,278
Booyah! We got him.

589
00:31:21,345 --> 00:31:23,112
You want backup?

590
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:25,081
Negative. Hold positions.

591
00:31:25,148 --> 00:31:26,550
I don't wanna scare him off.

592
00:31:26,616 --> 00:31:28,618
Careful, Slayer I... In the wrong hands,

593
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:31,255
even a candy cane can be a lethal weapon.

594
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:39,829
His footprints led me the wrong way.

595
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:41,531
<i>It's a trick!</i>

596
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:44,400
A trick? Well, where is he?

597
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:47,570
Elizabeth... behind you.

598
00:31:47,637 --> 00:31:49,372
I can't look. I can't breathe.

599
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,141
<i>I might be having a heart attack</i>

600
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:53,176
<i>or a stroke or a heart a-stroke.</i>

601
00:31:53,243 --> 00:31:55,345
Please don't naughty-list me.

602
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:57,347
I'm a good girl, I do Girl Scouts,

603
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,816
I like ponies, I bedazzle.

604
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:05,154
Oh... my... Go...

605
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:08,825
I think I just swallowed my retainer.

606
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:10,360
Zoey, use your words.

607
00:32:10,427 --> 00:32:12,929
The phenomenon's on the move.

608
00:32:12,996 --> 00:32:14,731
At the fireplace.

609
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:17,067
No, wait. Richard, he's headed your way.

610
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:18,735
Swarm, swarm!

611
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:24,341
I've got eyes on target, people.

612
00:32:27,143 --> 00:32:28,945
He's so strangely beautiful.

613
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:30,847
I feel weird,

614
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:34,017
like I'm gonna laugh and
cry and tinkle all at once.

615
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:35,719
Before you do any of that,

616
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:38,188
tag him with a glow ball so
we can see him in the dark.

617
00:32:38,254 --> 00:32:39,589
Copy that.

618
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:46,796
Slayer in pursuit.

619
00:32:46,863 --> 00:32:48,808
<i>Be advised, Santa's got some wheels.</i>

620
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,904
Oh... oh!

621
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:04,981
Whoa, the foyer! Go
through the dining room.

622
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:06,649
I'm jumping in.

623
00:33:06,716 --> 00:33:07,984
I got this!

624
00:33:12,522 --> 00:33:14,224
Uh-oh. Whoa, whoa.

625
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,759
Santa!

626
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:23,300
Santa? Ooh.

627
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:26,870
He's fast for a fat man.

628
00:33:26,937 --> 00:33:28,839
Like some Christmas super-ninja.

629
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:30,665
I'm pretty sure I tagged
him with a glow ball

630
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:31,841
right in the jingle bells.

631
00:33:31,908 --> 00:33:34,444
How much more trouble can we get into?

632
00:33:34,511 --> 00:33:37,647
We still don't have any usable evidence.

633
00:33:39,816 --> 00:33:40,984
He's mine.

634
00:33:42,886 --> 00:33:44,020
Alex, wait!

635
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:54,031
Wait, where's Alex?

636
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:58,368
Alex?

637
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:06,743
I saw him.

638
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:08,545
It was Santa Claus. Duh.

639
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:10,447
I'm off to use water closet

640
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:14,117
when big man in red suit
runs right past me.

641
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:17,821
I hide under dirty laundry,
another humiliation.

642
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:18,921
What about Alex?

643
00:34:18,988 --> 00:34:20,757
Where's Alex?

644
00:34:25,494 --> 00:34:27,697
They went down the laundry chute?

645
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:31,801
It's madness, no?

646
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:35,938
How does red-clad,
plus-size bowl full of jelly

647
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:37,340
fit down that laundry chute?

648
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:38,407
But he did.

649
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,946
They're in the basement.

650
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,350
Who's in the basement?

651
00:34:48,785 --> 00:34:51,287
Alex. Hey, buddy. Are you here?

652
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:52,422
Whoo! Alex!

653
00:34:52,488 --> 00:34:53,924
Hey, Alex?

654
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,795
No way!

655
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:00,497
The mother lode.

656
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:02,665
I've got point.

657
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:09,539
Ooh, oh, presents!

658
00:35:11,807 --> 00:35:14,377
Let's stay on mission, people.

659
00:35:14,443 --> 00:35:15,845
Yeah, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

660
00:35:15,912 --> 00:35:18,080
You're right, you're right, you're right.

661
00:35:18,147 --> 00:35:19,516
Take that thing. Yeah.

662
00:35:19,582 --> 00:35:22,485
Alex, buddy? Are you in there?

663
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:25,321
Alex? Aah!

664
00:35:25,388 --> 00:35:27,023
Uncle Charlie? You okay?

665
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,425
Alex!

666
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:31,728
It's Alex's backpack.

667
00:35:31,794 --> 00:35:33,329
He's down there. It's... it's deep.

668
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:34,563
It's, like, a pit.

669
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,365
But... but he's down there.

670
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:37,700
Zoey, what are you doing?

671
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:39,401
I'm getting my rescue on.

672
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:40,570
Elizabeth's too delicate,

673
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:42,705
and I'm Alex's favorite cousin.

674
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:45,541
Hold up, I'm Alex's number-one cuz.

675
00:35:45,608 --> 00:35:47,143
You wanna do this, then?

676
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,347
Uh... I'm cool with two.

677
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:52,281
Less work.

678
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:55,051
Cannonball!

679
00:35:55,118 --> 00:35:56,286
Whoa!

680
00:35:58,488 --> 00:36:00,624
Grab the rope! Grab the rope!

681
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:06,796
Okay, oh, oh, ease her down.
Ease her down, Ease her down.

682
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:11,935
Alex?

683
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:13,570
Yep, down here.

684
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,771
You did bring a rope, right?

685
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:17,574
All over it.

686
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:20,210
Hey, cuz, I'm pretty sure a present for you

687
00:36:20,276 --> 00:36:21,411
hit me in the ear earlier.

688
00:36:21,477 --> 00:36:22,712
Oh, great.

689
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:24,180
What happened? Where's Santa?

690
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:27,784
Almost had him...
all the way down the laundry chute.

691
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:30,420
Then we hit the basement floor... hard.

692
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:31,854
He got loose.

693
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:33,722
All I could find was Santa's sack.

694
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:36,425
A lot of presents inside, as you can see.

695
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:38,527
So, I might have peeked inside,

696
00:36:38,594 --> 00:36:40,330
maybe a little too far inside.

697
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:41,597
And you fell in.

698
00:36:41,664 --> 00:36:44,033
And I fell in... yep.

699
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,503
Here, grab my hand.

700
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,064
Pull her up. Pull her up.

701
00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:51,107
Whoa!

702
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,284
It's incredible,
like some "Alice in Wonderland" thing.

703
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:04,988
It's like an endless warehouse
of Christmas presents down there.

704
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:07,156
Was there anything for me in there?

705
00:37:07,223 --> 00:37:08,959
Maybe a go-kart? I should look.

706
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:13,063
The sack, it's gone.

707
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:14,296
Where'd it go?

708
00:37:14,363 --> 00:37:15,765
It's gone. It's gone!

709
00:37:15,831 --> 00:37:17,901
He's got tools. He's going for the chimney.

710
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:18,901
Let's go!

711
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:20,904
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

712
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:29,710
He's going for the roof.
He's headed for the sleigh.

713
00:37:34,383 --> 00:37:36,753
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

714
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:39,889
Oh, my golly goobers!

715
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:41,124
Let me see.

716
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:48,197
I... I... I got it. I got the close-up!

717
00:37:48,264 --> 00:37:50,366
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

718
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:51,935
Whoa!

719
00:37:52,002 --> 00:37:53,302
Whoa!

720
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:54,971
Oh, boy! What's happening?

721
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:56,939
Um... Santa.

722
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:59,175
Santa! Santa!

723
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:00,876
Oh! Oh!

724
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:03,721
I think he went down over
there by the golf course.

725
00:38:05,114 --> 00:38:06,949
Hunters, get your coats.

726
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:08,785
We're going on a recon mission.

727
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:11,820
It's go time.

728
00:38:11,887 --> 00:38:14,524
I... I...

729
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:22,064
If Santa's dead, I'm totally
getting kicked out of Girl Scouts.

730
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:23,933
Well, I'm sure the trees broke his fall.

731
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,668
And then, there's the snow,
and his bowl full of jelly

732
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:28,104
would probably absorb most of the impact,
so...

733
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,908
We're gonna need artillery,
the heavy stuff...

734
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:33,810
Tasers or rocket launchers.

735
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:36,178
No rocket launchers. Get in the car, man.

736
00:38:36,245 --> 00:38:38,280
What if he wants revenge?

737
00:38:38,347 --> 00:38:40,150
Santa doesn't do revenge.

738
00:38:40,216 --> 00:38:42,084
The dude makes a naughty list.

739
00:38:42,151 --> 00:38:44,486
Making lists is, like, Revenge 101.

740
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:45,788
I'm out.

741
00:38:45,854 --> 00:38:47,723
Guys, Santa's out in the cold.

742
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,359
He might be hurt.

743
00:38:49,426 --> 00:38:54,330
After all he's done for kids,
for us, we owe him.

744
00:38:54,397 --> 00:38:56,037
But keep the cameras rolling just in case.

745
00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:57,265
You got the memory card ready?

746
00:38:57,266 --> 00:38:58,601
Duh. All right, cool.

747
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:00,891
Natasha's coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.

748
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,406
I had to put my face on because of TV.

749
00:39:04,473 --> 00:39:06,609
America, everything is reality show.

750
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:08,011
You... you're coming?

751
00:39:08,077 --> 00:39:09,245
Yes, Charlie.

752
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,980
I mean, this is incredible, right?

753
00:39:11,046 --> 00:39:13,550
I mean, I'm trying to keep
it together for the kids,

754
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:14,951
but when I saw those flying reindeer...

755
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:17,587
I peed myself a little.

756
00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:20,723
No, uh, metaphorically.

757
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,491
Come on, come on. Come on, come on.

758
00:39:22,558 --> 00:39:23,993
My lip gloss is freezing.

759
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,594
All right, seat belts.

760
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:27,363
Let's go get Santa!

761
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:36,306
Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa!

762
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:46,716
All right, all right, all right.

763
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:48,117
Here's the entrance to the golf course.

764
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:50,219
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

765
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:52,454
All right,
this is around where he went down,

766
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:53,890
so he could be...

767
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,995
He could be anywhere.

768
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,635
Stupid flashlight.

769
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:07,837
Anybody have any spare batteries?

770
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:10,673
Well, let me see.

771
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:13,175
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

772
00:40:13,242 --> 00:40:15,478
You know, I've been meaning to tell you.

773
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:18,714
You know, I'm glad you're the
one taking care of this.

774
00:40:18,781 --> 00:40:20,983
Why'd you give it to me?

775
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,819
You know, I thought a kid should have it,

776
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:26,163
someone who could still believe
in the true magic of it all.

777
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:28,791
Whoop!

778
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:33,295
Guys, guys, I have a visual!

779
00:40:33,362 --> 00:40:35,331
Come on, let's go!

780
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:42,338
It's... it's...

781
00:40:42,404 --> 00:40:44,273
The mothership.

782
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:47,844
Awesome!

783
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:50,914
We found it!

784
00:40:56,518 --> 00:40:57,753
Oh, ho, ho!

785
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,122
Nice car!

786
00:41:00,189 --> 00:41:02,425
Now, this... whoa...

787
00:41:02,491 --> 00:41:04,260
Is a classic.

788
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:09,933
I smell something.

789
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:13,536
Something good.

790
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:19,709
Cookies!

791
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:21,744
Look at this!

792
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:25,581
Charlie, we need pictures.

793
00:41:25,648 --> 00:41:28,851
Video. Lots of our own video.

794
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:30,638
Oh, baby, the kids got all sorts of videos.

795
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:31,754
It's all being uploaded back at the...

796
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:33,890
Ow!

797
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:44,734
Santa?

798
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:47,170
Well, this is awkward.

799
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:51,674
Whoa, oh... oh! Ooh!

800
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:53,176
Oh!

801
00:41:54,276 --> 00:41:56,165
Oh, I got him. I got him. I got ya.

802
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,948
Ooh.

803
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:01,417
Oh.

804
00:42:01,483 --> 00:42:02,785
That was a mighty one.

805
00:42:02,852 --> 00:42:04,754
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

806
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:06,355
He's shorter than in the movies.

807
00:42:06,422 --> 00:42:07,857
So, are we really sure it's him?

808
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:09,491
The belt buckle. Check out the belt buckle.

809
00:42:09,558 --> 00:42:11,994
What fake Santa would
have that belt buckle?

810
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:14,263
Exactly. I think it's him.

811
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,397
There's no doubt.

812
00:42:15,464 --> 00:42:17,200
It's him.

813
00:42:17,266 --> 00:42:20,569
Uh, uh, uh, my name is, uh...

814
00:42:20,636 --> 00:42:21,738
Alex!

815
00:42:21,804 --> 00:42:22,738
He knows.

816
00:42:22,805 --> 00:42:24,840
Alex, right, Alex!

817
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:26,642
My name's Alex, right? Yeah.

818
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:29,111
And we're the Santa Hunters. Yeah.

819
00:42:29,178 --> 00:42:33,048
Aren't you a little old
to be Santa hunting?

820
00:42:33,115 --> 00:42:34,284
Well, I'm a... I'm an honorary member.

821
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,051
See, I'm a kid at heart.

822
00:42:36,118 --> 00:42:37,520
I don't have a uniform or anything.

823
00:42:37,586 --> 00:42:38,854
It's just... just this.

824
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:40,756
I could use a hand.

825
00:42:40,823 --> 00:42:45,228
Santa might've had a tad too many
of Mrs. Claus's snickerdoodles.

826
00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:47,730
Finding it mighty hard to bend over.

827
00:42:47,796 --> 00:42:49,399
Ho, ho, ho, boy.

828
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:51,434
Oh... ah.

829
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:54,303
Oh, what happened? Where'd it go?

830
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,705
Oh, no.

831
00:42:55,772 --> 00:42:57,106
It's happening.

832
00:43:00,142 --> 00:43:01,977
What's going on? What's happening?

833
00:43:02,044 --> 00:43:05,113
Great, now candy canes are blowing up.

834
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,950
That's because it's a Christmas candy cane.

835
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:09,451
I was afraid of this.

836
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:10,953
Me too.

837
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,140
What are we afraid of again?

838
00:43:12,154 --> 00:43:14,656
Christmas's magic is weakening,

839
00:43:14,723 --> 00:43:16,291
and I might be next.

840
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:18,995
Must have been what threw
the reindeer off course

841
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:20,563
and caused the crash.

842
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,298
See,
everything that has to do with Christmas,

843
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:24,833
well, it's in danger of shattering,

844
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,969
much like your candy cane, I'm afraid.

845
00:43:27,035 --> 00:43:29,805
Uh, why is Christmas's magic weakening?

846
00:43:29,872 --> 00:43:31,073
Yeah. Why?

847
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:33,075
Well, because of you.

848
00:43:33,142 --> 00:43:35,044
Us? What?

849
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:36,779
I'm afraid so.

850
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:41,317
You see, children aren't
actually supposed to see Santa.

851
00:43:41,383 --> 00:43:43,219
It's part of the Christmas rules.

852
00:43:43,285 --> 00:43:46,289
That's why Santa has to
stay on the down-low.

853
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:48,825
Even if a few kids get a glimpse of me,

854
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:52,828
well, Christmas' magic lessens.

855
00:43:52,895 --> 00:43:54,297
And then, that happens.

856
00:43:58,267 --> 00:43:59,435
Oh!

857
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:04,239
In '72, two kids laid a
Polaroid trap for old Santa.

858
00:44:04,306 --> 00:44:06,275
They only took one picture...

859
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:09,144
Blitzen's antlers... Poof!

860
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:11,046
Now he wears prosthetics.

861
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:13,048
Just looks weird.

862
00:44:13,115 --> 00:44:16,586
I'll help you, Santa, or is it
Kris Kringle? Whatever you want.

863
00:44:16,652 --> 00:44:17,887
Yes, this one right here.

864
00:44:17,953 --> 00:44:19,555
Grab that one, and...

865
00:44:20,857 --> 00:44:22,291
Oh, well.

866
00:44:22,357 --> 00:44:23,458
More of those.

867
00:44:23,525 --> 00:44:24,994
Aah!

868
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,898
Dudes, if this is what happens
from just seeing him...

869
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:30,599
What have I done?

870
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:34,170
Nothing yet,
but we can't let anybody see this video.

871
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:36,039
If it gets out, it would be...

872
00:44:36,105 --> 00:44:38,040
Santa-geddon.

873
00:44:38,107 --> 00:44:41,277
Childrens.

874
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,980
Have you all gone snow-crazy?

875
00:44:44,046 --> 00:44:46,848
You're the Santa Hunters, yes?

876
00:44:46,915 --> 00:44:48,083
Oh.

877
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,953
Big Kringle, he's just sore loser.

878
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:52,355
He's probably lying.

879
00:44:53,422 --> 00:44:55,557
Whoa, what the... Did you see that?

880
00:44:55,624 --> 00:44:56,659
Or not.

881
00:44:56,726 --> 00:44:57,860
It doesn't matter.

882
00:44:57,927 --> 00:45:01,497
No one has real video of Santa.

883
00:45:01,563 --> 00:45:03,932
We can sell it. We'll be rich.

884
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:08,370
Plenty of people will pay for a
thousand Christmases, a million!

885
00:45:08,437 --> 00:45:12,174
Natasha, baby, that...
That doesn't seem right.

886
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,010
Charlie, you can't even keep a job,

887
00:45:15,077 --> 00:45:18,447
and I am woman of expensive taste.

888
00:45:18,514 --> 00:45:21,317
We can finally get rid of smelly car.

889
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:24,519
Smelly? My baby? The classic?

890
00:45:24,586 --> 00:45:27,289
Classic is American for "garbage."

891
00:45:27,356 --> 00:45:28,424
Ow.

892
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,859
Just... just ow.

893
00:45:30,926 --> 00:45:32,494
We're not selling anything.

894
00:45:32,561 --> 00:45:33,495
Yeah.

895
00:45:33,562 --> 00:45:35,030
This wasn't about money.

896
00:45:35,097 --> 00:45:37,966
And now it's up to us to help Santa.
Mm-hmm.

897
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:41,237
Fine, have it your way.

898
00:45:41,304 --> 00:45:43,372
We need to get back to the house,

899
00:45:43,439 --> 00:45:45,708
get the drive, and erase all the footage.

900
00:45:45,774 --> 00:45:47,176
Yeah, for sure.

901
00:45:50,545 --> 00:45:52,181
But it will be mine.

902
00:45:52,248 --> 00:45:54,016
Mush, you beasts!

903
00:45:55,984 --> 00:45:58,554
She's going for the hard drive!

904
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:02,057
Oh!

905
00:46:02,124 --> 00:46:03,559
She stole my sleigh!

906
00:46:03,626 --> 00:46:04,761
I can fix this!

907
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:07,763
Natasha, what are you doing?

908
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,633
Faster! You can't steal Santa's sleigh!

909
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:16,772
This is stealing! This is looting!

910
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:19,375
Go! Go! Go!

911
00:46:20,343 --> 00:46:21,677
This is not your sleigh!

912
00:46:21,744 --> 00:46:23,913
What is wrong with these stupid reindeer?

913
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:25,648
Don't you fly?

914
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:26,982
This'll end Santa!

915
00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:28,283
Good! Ha ha!

916
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,018
Who needs stupid Santa?

917
00:46:30,085 --> 00:46:32,288
I can buy my own presents.

918
00:46:32,354 --> 00:46:34,256
I will go back to Moosplaskistan,

919
00:46:34,323 --> 00:46:37,426
live like queen, make villagers jealous.

920
00:46:37,493 --> 00:46:39,261
I got a unicorn tattoo for you!

921
00:46:39,328 --> 00:46:42,098
Baby... No, not the snowman!

922
00:46:46,168 --> 00:46:48,403
Come on, baby, don't you...

923
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,973
Missed me!

924
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,841
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

925
00:46:52,908 --> 00:46:55,277
Come on, slow it down!

926
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:57,446
Aw, cookie crumbs.

927
00:46:57,512 --> 00:47:00,068
We'll never beat her back
to the house on foot.

928
00:47:05,043 --> 00:47:06,321
Come on, reindeer, fly.

929
00:47:06,388 --> 00:47:08,490
That's right, you dumb reindeer, fly!

930
00:47:08,557 --> 00:47:11,193
The sidewalk! Mush, mush!

931
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,540
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

932
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:14,664
Natasha, we can make this work, baby.

933
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,298
Slow down.

934
00:47:16,365 --> 00:47:18,600
You can't steal a sleigh!

935
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:19,968
Faster!

936
00:47:20,035 --> 00:47:21,804
This is Santa's. This is not your sleigh.

937
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:24,139
This is Santa's sleigh.
Give it back to Santa.

938
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:25,808
This is not yours.

939
00:47:25,874 --> 00:47:28,944
I finally get the Christmas
I've always wanted!

940
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,347
Natasha's Christmas!

941
00:47:39,955 --> 00:47:41,657
Mush! Mush!

942
00:47:41,723 --> 00:47:43,024
Natasha! Faster!

943
00:47:44,393 --> 00:47:46,796
Come on, baby, this is crazy!

944
00:47:50,132 --> 00:47:52,234
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

945
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:53,902
How hard can it be?

946
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:56,747
Grandpa drives,
and he can't even zip up his pants.

947
00:47:59,475 --> 00:48:03,078
Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

948
00:48:07,182 --> 00:48:08,350
Natasha!

949
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:11,753
What is wrong with you, stupid reindeer?

950
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,022
What is wrong with you?

951
00:48:13,088 --> 00:48:14,857
Fly! No!

952
00:48:14,924 --> 00:48:15,857
Whoa!

953
00:48:15,924 --> 00:48:17,460
Fly!

954
00:48:18,527 --> 00:48:21,730
Oh, this is what I need, the fly button!

955
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:29,304
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

956
00:48:29,371 --> 00:48:31,540
Ohh!

957
00:48:34,243 --> 00:48:36,144
Don't try this at home, people.

958
00:48:36,211 --> 00:48:37,946
Oh!

959
00:48:43,953 --> 00:48:47,189
That's why we wear seat belts, people.

960
00:48:49,704 --> 00:48:51,593
Don't tell Uncle Charlie I executed

961
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,230
that entire chase with
the emergency brake on.

962
00:48:57,232 --> 00:48:59,235
Come on, let's go!

963
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:04,105
Whoa.

964
00:49:04,172 --> 00:49:05,874
The reindeer broke free!

965
00:49:05,941 --> 00:49:08,611
There goes the reindeer without the sleigh.

966
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:10,612
She must've pressed the
reindeer-release button.

967
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:12,682
This is bad. This is very bad.

968
00:49:12,748 --> 00:49:15,418
Speaking of bad, where's Natasha?

969
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:18,187
Backdoor!

970
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,328
It's locked!

971
00:49:26,395 --> 00:49:28,497
She locked us out.
Why would she lock us out?

972
00:49:28,564 --> 00:49:30,399
It's cold out here! Not really.

973
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:32,201
You know what she's doing up there, right?

974
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:35,204
If she gets her hands on the
command center's hard drive...

975
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,072
And shows the footage to the world...

976
00:49:37,138 --> 00:49:39,641
Christmas is ruined...

977
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:40,809
forever.

978
00:49:40,876 --> 00:49:42,277
Ho, ho, no!

979
00:49:42,344 --> 00:49:43,879
Okay, okay, okay, hold on.

980
00:49:43,946 --> 00:49:45,280
Wait!

981
00:49:45,347 --> 00:49:47,416
Maybe I can hack into the
command center's network

982
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:49,384
from my laptop and erase everything

983
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:52,253
remotely before she downloads it.

984
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,822
The tree house!

985
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,892
We've gotta erase that footage!

986
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:33,229
Hello.

987
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:35,965
Ooh, ooh.

988
00:50:36,031 --> 00:50:38,833
Ooh!

989
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,035
Oh!

990
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:41,370
I still can't believe it.

991
00:50:41,436 --> 00:50:42,771
Is this really real?

992
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:44,439
Yes, it is real,

993
00:50:44,506 --> 00:50:46,542
and that's causing some real pain,
my friend.

994
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:49,678
Guys, leave Santa alone.

995
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:51,714
Zoey, give me some good news.

996
00:50:53,882 --> 00:50:56,418
It's too late. Our files
have been breached.

997
00:50:56,484 --> 00:50:58,186
She's got everything.

998
00:50:58,253 --> 00:51:00,422
Now what is she gonna do?

999
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:04,126
What was that?

1000
00:51:04,193 --> 00:51:05,593
The ladder!

1001
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:06,796
Oh!

1002
00:51:07,863 --> 00:51:10,165
Natasha! Baby, this is crazy.

1003
00:51:10,232 --> 00:51:12,234
It's Christmas Eve.
These kids should be in bed.

1004
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:15,304
Look, just put up the ladder.
We'll all come down.

1005
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:16,739
We can discuss this over some hot cocoa.

1006
00:51:16,806 --> 00:51:18,107
I'll put some marshmallows
in there for you.

1007
00:51:18,173 --> 00:51:19,542
You like that.

1008
00:51:19,608 --> 00:51:22,611
Oh, it's too late for marshmallows,
Chuckles.

1009
00:51:22,677 --> 00:51:25,614
I have a lottery ticket to cash.

1010
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:28,917
Oh, and I will be traveling
in your precious classic

1011
00:51:28,984 --> 00:51:30,586
for its very last ride.

1012
00:51:30,653 --> 00:51:32,688
Have a good life.

1013
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:35,490
Well,
it's hard to go anywhere without the keys.

1014
00:51:35,557 --> 00:51:37,659
And you're not gonna get a ride.

1015
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:40,261
It's Christmas,
and it's a long walk back to the city...

1016
00:51:40,328 --> 00:51:42,384
A lot of wear and tear on those heels.

1017
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:44,566
Okay.

1018
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:46,635
Okay, okay.

1019
00:51:46,702 --> 00:51:48,971
In the spirit of the Christmas,

1020
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:51,006
we can do an exchange of the gifts.

1021
00:51:51,072 --> 00:51:54,642
You throw down keys, and I put up ladder.

1022
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:57,379
Listen, kids, if you can buy me some time,

1023
00:51:57,446 --> 00:51:59,246
I think I figured out a
way for us to get down

1024
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,749
even without my magic.

1025
00:52:00,816 --> 00:52:06,388
Sure. Everybody, Operation Arctic Thunder.

1026
00:52:06,454 --> 00:52:08,523
Snowballs, guys,
we're gonna throw snowballs.

1027
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:10,526
- Oh.
- Come on, let's go!

1028
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:14,530
What are you waiting for, Christmas?

1029
00:52:16,899 --> 00:52:19,334
The car key, give it to me.

1030
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:21,937
You heard the lady. Give it to her.

1031
00:52:23,305 --> 00:52:25,707
Nice one, Richard! Ah... ah!

1032
00:52:25,774 --> 00:52:28,611
Not the face. Not the face! Hey!

1033
00:52:30,545 --> 00:52:33,349
Ankle-biting monsters!

1034
00:52:34,683 --> 00:52:36,385
I got your fancy coat too!

1035
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,587
Nice one, Zoey.

1036
00:52:39,654 --> 00:52:40,856
I got her lip gloss.

1037
00:52:40,923 --> 00:52:42,057
I got your hair!

1038
00:52:42,124 --> 00:52:44,693
I got her shoes! Awesome!

1039
00:52:44,759 --> 00:52:48,863
Looks like Charlie 2.0 gets the last laugh.

1040
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,399
Oh! No!

1041
00:52:50,465 --> 00:52:53,802
Uncle Charlie, really?

1042
00:52:57,973 --> 00:52:59,741
Thank you.

1043
00:53:03,379 --> 00:53:05,614
That's what you kids
might call an epic fail.

1044
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,050
Don't worry, Santa's got this.

1045
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:10,819
Santa might be down, but he's never...

1046
00:53:10,886 --> 00:53:11,820
Ooh!

1047
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:12,621
Santa!

1048
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:14,322
Oh! Uh-oh!

1049
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:16,258
Oh! Santa!

1050
00:53:16,325 --> 00:53:19,228
I'm okay. Just my spleen.

1051
00:53:19,294 --> 00:53:20,529
He's okay. He's okay.

1052
00:53:20,595 --> 00:53:22,664
Um, a little help with the ladder.

1053
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:25,600
Go, come on, come on. Let's go.

1054
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:27,602
Alex, she's going for the classic.

1055
00:53:27,669 --> 00:53:29,170
We'll never make it in time.

1056
00:53:29,237 --> 00:53:31,140
Zoey, go for drone.

1057
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:35,110
Roger that, boss. Roger that.

1058
00:53:38,346 --> 00:53:39,648
Yes!

1059
00:53:39,714 --> 00:53:42,951
Yeah! Get her! Get her!

1060
00:53:43,017 --> 00:53:47,822
Oh, you stupid, evil, flying toy.

1061
00:53:47,889 --> 00:53:49,557
Oh!

1062
00:53:49,624 --> 00:53:51,227
Ha ha! Oh...

1063
00:53:53,161 --> 00:53:54,063
Natasha?

1064
00:53:54,129 --> 00:53:57,066
The pretty ponies are dancing.

1065
00:53:58,867 --> 00:54:01,503
Isn't she beautiful when she's sleeping?

1066
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:03,905
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

1067
00:54:03,972 --> 00:54:05,974
Oh, yes, yeah.

1068
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:07,643
Hm, well...

1069
00:54:07,709 --> 00:54:11,413
Hey! Guys, there's some good news.

1070
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,248
Whoa. We have the hard drive.

1071
00:54:13,315 --> 00:54:14,650
Whoo! Yeah!

1072
00:54:14,716 --> 00:54:16,494
But there's still some bad news.

1073
00:54:17,552 --> 00:54:19,288
Oh!

1074
00:54:19,354 --> 00:54:20,789
Oh!

1075
00:54:20,855 --> 00:54:22,591
Ooh!

1076
00:54:22,657 --> 00:54:25,627
It's getting worse.
Christmas is disappearing.

1077
00:54:25,694 --> 00:54:26,929
This is not good.

1078
00:54:26,995 --> 00:54:28,196
Oh, Santa.

1079
00:54:28,263 --> 00:54:30,866
Oh, I'm feeling weaker.

1080
00:54:30,932 --> 00:54:33,501
Oh, man, I've destroyed Christmas.

1081
00:54:33,568 --> 00:54:36,872
You were just trying to share
Santa with everyone else.

1082
00:54:36,939 --> 00:54:38,340
What's wrong with that?

1083
00:54:38,407 --> 00:54:41,576
No, I was trying to prove that I was right.

1084
00:54:41,643 --> 00:54:43,512
That's a total naughty-list move.

1085
00:54:43,578 --> 00:54:46,114
I mean, you don't have to prove anything.

1086
00:54:46,181 --> 00:54:48,082
Christmas is what you make of it.

1087
00:54:48,149 --> 00:54:50,985
You don't need videos or DNA evidence.

1088
00:54:51,052 --> 00:54:53,855
You just need a little... Belief.

1089
00:54:53,922 --> 00:54:54,990
Belief.

1090
00:54:55,056 --> 00:54:58,026
Belief is not limited by the impossible.

1091
00:54:58,093 --> 00:55:01,329
It's belief that makes
the impossible happen.

1092
00:55:01,396 --> 00:55:03,264
Belief, that's it!

1093
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:05,333
The magic is believing.

1094
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,168
Oh... Oh, boy.

1095
00:55:07,235 --> 00:55:09,704
Hold on.
And I believe we gotta get Santa here

1096
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:11,439
back to doing what Santa does best,
all right?

1097
00:55:11,506 --> 00:55:12,740
It's getting late.

1098
00:55:12,807 --> 00:55:14,843
Hate to be O Tannen-bummer,

1099
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:17,466
but we don't even have
reindeer for the sleigh.

1100
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:20,615
Santa isn't going anywhere.

1101
00:55:20,682 --> 00:55:22,417
All right, come on. We'll figure it out.

1102
00:55:22,484 --> 00:55:24,119
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1103
00:55:24,186 --> 00:55:26,254
Huh, I don't reckon that this thing

1104
00:55:26,321 --> 00:55:28,390
can, uh, fly without reindeer.

1105
00:55:28,456 --> 00:55:29,858
You reckon correctly.

1106
00:55:29,924 --> 00:55:31,460
But I remember back in the day

1107
00:55:31,526 --> 00:55:34,229
the elves built a fancy engine

1108
00:55:34,296 --> 00:55:36,631
just in case anything
happened to the reindeer,

1109
00:55:36,698 --> 00:55:39,534
like back in '62, when Dasher brought back

1110
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:42,504
a terrible case of diarrhea,
and the whole team caught it.

1111
00:55:42,571 --> 00:55:43,705
Oh, my gosh.

1112
00:55:43,772 --> 00:55:45,707
Oh, the mess.

1113
00:55:45,774 --> 00:55:47,576
You can't unsee things like that.

1114
00:55:48,877 --> 00:55:51,813
Anyhoo, the fancy engine needs a key,

1115
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,317
which I lost in a blizzard some years ago.

1116
00:55:55,384 --> 00:55:56,318
A key?

1117
00:55:56,385 --> 00:55:58,653
Yes, a funny-looking thing.

1118
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,590
It was supposed to fit right here.

1119
00:56:01,656 --> 00:56:03,692
Huh. I recognize that shape.

1120
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:06,695
Me, too, but why?

1121
00:56:06,762 --> 00:56:09,131
The key, what did it look like?

1122
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:11,466
Well, it was a curvy thing about yay big.

1123
00:56:11,533 --> 00:56:13,669
No way.

1124
00:56:13,735 --> 00:56:17,406
Did it look anything like...

1125
00:56:17,473 --> 00:56:18,873
this?

1126
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,977
Ho, ho, ho!

1127
00:56:22,043 --> 00:56:24,146
Ho, ho, ho... Oh, my key!

1128
00:56:24,212 --> 00:56:25,247
Oh, a key.

1129
00:56:25,313 --> 00:56:26,514
That pipe is your key?

1130
00:56:26,581 --> 00:56:28,250
Oh, a pipe, heavens no, heavens no.

1131
00:56:28,317 --> 00:56:30,251
Common misconception. Santa never smoked.

1132
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:33,021
Oh, I can't believe you found my key.

1133
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:40,329
Oh!

1134
00:56:44,432 --> 00:56:47,035
So, I am way behind,

1135
00:56:47,102 --> 00:56:49,771
and I could use all the help I can get.

1136
00:56:50,751 --> 00:56:52,474
Oh, yeah, let's... Oh, yes, yes!

1137
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:54,609
Come on, get in there.

1138
00:56:54,676 --> 00:56:58,547
This is crazy, even for me,
and I'm Santa Claus. Ho ho!

1139
00:56:58,613 --> 00:56:59,981
Tonight's been insane.

1140
00:57:00,048 --> 00:57:02,450
We met Santa, saw reindeer fly.

1141
00:57:02,517 --> 00:57:03,819
We're in Santa's sleigh.

1142
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:07,790
I mean,
nothing's impossible as long as we believe.

1143
00:57:07,856 --> 00:57:10,792
Mm, it's not going. Something's missing.

1144
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:12,493
Christmas fuel.

1145
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,162
What?

1146
00:57:14,229 --> 00:57:16,865
Have you people learned nothing tonight?

1147
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:19,968
Believe, believe, believe.

1148
00:57:20,035 --> 00:57:25,273
Believe, believe, believe,
believe, believe.

1149
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:29,178
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

1150
00:57:29,244 --> 00:57:30,412
We're flying!

1151
00:57:34,482 --> 00:57:37,619
This sure beats looking at reindeer butts,
huh?

1152
00:57:37,686 --> 00:57:40,155
And this baby is a classic.

1153
00:57:40,222 --> 00:57:42,825
All right, everyone, aim for the chimneys.

1154
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:45,225
Christmas magic will take care of the rest.

1155
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:48,729
Here you go!

1156
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:56,104
Santa, check it... Sky hook.

1157
00:57:56,171 --> 00:57:57,706
Ho, ho!

1158
00:57:57,773 --> 00:57:59,307
You got skills to pay the bills.

1159
00:57:59,374 --> 00:58:00,709
Great!

1160
00:58:06,948 --> 00:58:08,951
We're almost back on schedule.

1161
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,655
It's working. The magic's coming back!

1162
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:16,858
The more presents we deliver,
the stronger it gets.

1163
00:58:16,925 --> 00:58:19,694
Exactly.

1164
00:58:19,761 --> 00:58:21,830
Who wants to help Santa land this thing?

1165
00:58:21,896 --> 00:58:23,364
I do, I do, I do!

1166
00:58:23,431 --> 00:58:24,599
Come on, let's go.

1167
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:27,102
Come on over! Gotcha.

1168
00:58:34,075 --> 00:58:36,445
Ho, ho, home sweet home.

1169
00:58:40,382 --> 00:58:42,684
What did we just do? Thank you, everyone.

1170
00:58:42,751 --> 00:58:46,585
I thought the turbulence over Australia
would surely be the end of us.

1171
00:58:49,991 --> 00:58:52,261
I didn't think we were ever... Ohh...

1172
00:58:56,598 --> 00:58:57,932
What about Natasha?

1173
00:58:57,999 --> 00:58:59,801
We can fix this.

1174
00:59:07,508 --> 00:59:08,643
Oh!

1175
00:59:19,053 --> 00:59:23,191
Merry Christmas,<i> milaya moya.</i>

1176
00:59:23,257 --> 00:59:24,493
Shh.

1177
00:59:26,594 --> 00:59:30,899
Well, thank you for helping
me bring the magic back.

1178
00:59:30,966 --> 00:59:32,968
I couldn't have done it without you.

1179
00:59:33,035 --> 00:59:35,770
I always believed, and I always will.

1180
00:59:35,837 --> 00:59:37,138
Good.

1181
00:59:37,205 --> 00:59:39,340
Merry Christmas, Santa Hunters.

1182
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:41,143
Oh, that reminds me.

1183
00:59:42,277 --> 00:59:44,222
I think it's time for a name change.

1184
00:59:46,848 --> 00:59:48,649
Carrots?

1185
00:59:48,716 --> 00:59:50,018
Carrots.

1186
00:59:50,084 --> 00:59:52,787
I heard that dang bunny
is impossible to catch.

1187
00:59:52,854 --> 00:59:55,223
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

1188
00:59:57,959 --> 00:59:59,728
Bye! Good-bye.

1189
00:59:59,794 --> 01:00:01,162
Merry Christmas! Bye, Santa.

1190
01:00:01,229 --> 01:00:03,398
Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!

1191
01:00:03,465 --> 01:00:05,099
Good-bye, Santa!

1192
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:06,535
Bye!

1193
01:00:08,503 --> 01:00:11,907
I never got to ask him what "ho,
ho, ho" meant.

1194
01:00:13,608 --> 01:00:15,943
Alex, we forgot to give Santa

1195
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,413
the hard drive with all the footage on it.

1196
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,614
What?!

1197
01:00:19,681 --> 01:00:21,416
Now what do we do?

1198
01:00:21,483 --> 01:00:23,385
Uh, I don't know. It's up to us.

1199
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:26,520
I guess we could just smash it.

1200
01:00:26,587 --> 01:00:27,956
Hey.

1201
01:00:29,224 --> 01:00:31,626
I never did have a chance to use this.

1202
01:00:32,761 --> 01:00:34,496
Have at it.

1203
01:00:34,562 --> 01:00:35,830
Aw, yeah!

1204
01:00:35,896 --> 01:00:38,466
That's a $200 hard drive.

1205
01:00:38,533 --> 01:00:41,102
Come on.

1206
01:00:41,169 --> 01:00:43,338
Oh, blërg, it's Christmas.

1207
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:49,844
Yeah!

1208
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:51,412
Okay, go, go, go.

1209
01:00:51,479 --> 01:00:54,516
Hey, hey, kids! Hey, it's Christmas.

1210
01:00:55,517 --> 01:00:57,151
That's weird. Usually they're the ones

1211
01:00:57,218 --> 01:00:58,353
waking me up on Christmas morning.

1212
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,921
Well, go on up. Go see what's up.

1213
01:00:59,988 --> 01:01:01,556
All right, thanks. Mm-hmm.

1214
01:01:01,622 --> 01:01:03,625
Hey, guys?

1215
01:01:03,691 --> 01:01:05,260
Come on, sleepyheads.

1216
01:01:06,862 --> 01:01:08,830
Kids.

1217
01:01:08,897 --> 01:01:11,333
Santa came.

1218
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,934
Kids?

1219
01:01:16,203 --> 01:01:18,940
Elizabeth... time for presents.

1220
01:01:19,006 --> 01:01:21,209
Give 'em to charity.

1221
01:01:26,548 --> 01:01:28,450
You're letting in the cold.

1222
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:31,520
Guys.

1223
01:01:34,022 --> 01:01:36,624
Give us another hour...

1224
01:01:36,691 --> 01:01:38,293
or six.

1225
01:01:49,103 --> 01:01:51,606
The paint marks, they're gone.

1226
01:01:51,673 --> 01:01:53,507
The tree's back up.

1227
01:01:53,574 --> 01:01:56,911
Christmas is, like, normal again.

1228
01:01:56,978 --> 01:01:58,379
Wonder what we got.

1229
01:01:58,446 --> 01:02:00,715
I hope coffee...

1230
01:02:00,782 --> 01:02:02,650
gallons and gallons of coffee.

1231
01:02:02,717 --> 01:02:04,652
Merry Christmas!

1232
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:06,554
Oh, my gosh!

1233
01:02:06,621 --> 01:02:09,457
Oh, my gosh!

1234
01:02:09,524 --> 01:02:12,460
I've lost all ability to speak.

1235
01:02:20,468 --> 01:02:22,470
A new tiara.

1236
01:02:22,537 --> 01:02:23,537
Cool.

1237
01:02:24,806 --> 01:02:26,274
And it matches my pajamas.

1238
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:28,443
I've got to go find a mirror.

1239
01:02:32,947 --> 01:02:35,617
A new hard drive with unlimited storage?

1240
01:02:42,356 --> 01:02:44,259
No way!

1241
01:02:46,728 --> 01:02:49,030
Merry Christmas, Alex.

1242
01:02:49,097 --> 01:02:51,832
Always believe.

1243
01:02:51,899 --> 01:02:53,401
Huh.

1244
01:02:53,468 --> 01:02:55,970
So, I guess the tradition continues, huh?

1245
01:02:56,037 --> 01:02:58,006
Oh, my gosh, this is awesome.

1246
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,842
Hey, guys, come on!

1247
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:02,377
You will not believe this.

1248
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,083
The classic, it's...

1249
01:03:10,585 --> 01:03:12,053
Classic.

1250
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:19,593
How 'bout we give the
cameras a break this year?

1251
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,129
Cut!
