1
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,540
<i>Ooh-ooh.</i>

2
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,416
<i>Is that...?</i>

3
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:12,708
<i>- Oh, my God! What even is that?
- These are my moves.</i>

4
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,584
<i>- Stop, that's embarrassing.
- It's not embarrassing.</i>

5
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:21,040
<i>Wait, I was gonna interview you.</i>

6
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,668
<i>You were? What were you
gonna interview me about?</i>

7
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:25,416
<i>I don't know.</i>

8
00:01:26,124 --> 00:01:27,124
<i>Well...</i>

9
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:30,708
<i>Well, I just turned 11.</i>

10
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,540
<i>And you are 130,</i>

11
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,960
<i>turning 131 in two days.</i>

12
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:43,332
<i>So...</i>

13
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,168
<i>when you were 11,</i>

14
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:49,416
<i>what did you think
you would be doing now?</i>

15
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
<i>I love you.</i>

16
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:31,248
<i>Love you.</i>

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,124
<i>Bye.</i>

18
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:07,376
Hi everyone, my name is Belinda,

19
00:03:07,748 --> 00:03:10,376
and I'll be your tour rep
for the next week or two.

20
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,540
Now, I've only just transferred
in from Torremoli...

21
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:18,040
From Torremolinos!

22
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:21,708
Right, well, I...

23
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:26,040
I hope to be of help to you in Turkey.
We've got seven stops...

24
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,040
My name's Belinda.

25
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,460
And I've just come in from...

26
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,500
Torremolinos!

27
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,084
To... rre... mo... li... nos!

28
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:41,040
Torremolinos...

29
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,376
Hang tight, poppet, okay?

30
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Okay.

31
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:24,876
I'm fine.

32
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,168
Someone's coming.

33
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:07,540
Time for bed?

34
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:08,876
No.

35
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:22,332
Hello?

36
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,792
It's 501.

37
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:31,584
Yep, that's us.

38
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,832
Yeah, I booked a room with two beds,
but we've only got one.

39
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:50,292
<i>I paid for it
and it was confirmed by the travel agency.</i>

40
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,040
<i>That's all you can do?</i>

41
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,624
Scooch under, there we go.

42
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,584
<i>It will have to be, then.</i>

43
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:07,376
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

44
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:09,960
<i>Goodnight.</i>

45
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:12,708
Goodnight.

46
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:34,708
Digital video entertainment.

47
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:37,332
Don't get that wet, Soph.
It was expensive.

48
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,040
Sorry about the hotel.

49
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,208
Clive had a great time here.

50
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:57,668
Is everything okay at home?

51
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,376
What do you mean?

52
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,292
I mean, how are you
and your mum getting along?

53
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,376
Yeah, okay, I guess.

54
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,540
Good.

55
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,500
I'm glad.

56
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:11,248
Why? What did she tell you?

57
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,916
She didn't say anything.

58
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:16,168
You just told me you weren't getting along
last time I saw you.

59
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:19,960
I can't ask you
when I phone you at home.

60
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,292
Yeah, right.

61
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,876
Things have been better.

62
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:33,292
Why don't you go over
and introduce yourself?

63
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:36,748
Dad, no. They're, like, kids.

64
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,500
Uh-huh.

65
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:42,168
Why don't you go over
and introduce yourself?

66
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,748
Sophie, they're, like, old.

67
00:11:57,124 --> 00:12:01,248
<i>If you let it rest on an object
a bit, it gets the lighting right.</i>

68
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,376
<i>That's quite clever.</i>

69
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:17,376
<i>- You want a massive ice cream?
- Yeah, that's bigger than my head.</i>

70
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,832
<i>That's impossible,
you have a massive head.</i>

71
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,748
<i>- Are you done?
- What?</i>

72
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,584
<i>- That's a bit rude.
- No, it's not, it's just a fact.</i>

73
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:27,876
<i>Your head's bigger than mine.</i>

74
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:32,084
<i>I... I would disagree with that fact.
Look at the size of it.</i>

75
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,332
<i>Your head's bigger.</i>

76
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,460
<i>Say hello to your mum.</i>

77
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:15,668
<i>That's all?</i>

78
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,500
<i>- Love you.
- Say you miss her.</i>

79
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:19,916
<i>I miss you!</i>

80
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:21,248
<i>And what?</i>

81
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,668
<i>And bye-bye.</i>

82
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:24,708
<i>And what?</i>

83
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:27,376
<i>And my dad's being amazing.</i>

84
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,416
<i>- Why's your dad being amazing?
- Because he's so...</i>

85
00:14:40,124 --> 00:14:42,040
Uh-huh, what did she say?

86
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,792
I'll do it when I'm home.
School doesn't start until Tuesday.

87
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:49,668
Okay.

88
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,292
Yeah, it's good.
We're not actually at our hotel.

89
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,084
But ours doesn't have a phone.

90
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,208
Dad?

91
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,792
He's good.

92
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:04,540
Oh, my God, he's doing
weird slow-motion ninja moves.

93
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:06,708
Why is he so weird sometimes?

94
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,248
But, yeah, he's good.

95
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:13,916
All right. Love you, bye.

96
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,792
Mum wants to talk to you.

97
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,124
- What?
- Mum wants to talk to you.

98
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,416
All right.

99
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:27,332
Thanks, poppet.

100
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,040
Hey.

101
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:33,916
Checking up on me?

102
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:37,708
So, are you gonna do anything?

103
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:39,000
What do you mean?

104
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
With George.

105
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,832
He told Seb he wanted to...

106
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,460
with you, I mean.

107
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:47,040
Not Seb, obviously.

108
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:49,248
Last night, on the way home,

109
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:51,332
I gave Kenny...

110
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:54,292
Literally in the bushes
behind the other pool.

111
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,540
And what happened?

112
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,624
What do you mean?

113
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,960
Did he come?

114
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,292
Yeah... I mean, obviously.

115
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:09,332
You should wear your hair back sometimes.

116
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
You're really pretty with you hair back.

117
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,748
- Do you think she heard us?
- Who cares? She's like 9.

118
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:47,376
That's wonderful.

119
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:51,708
I'm so happy for you.

120
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:56,832
All right. Love you.

121
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,668
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

122
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:00,960
Yeah, will do.

123
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,208
Bye.

124
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,460
Hey.

125
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:13,540
You know how to play?

126
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:15,792
- It's that one to start.
- I know.

127
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,916
<i>Start your engine.</i>

128
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:15,376
- Wanna play again?
- We're up.

129
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:19,500
- Bye.
- Bye.

130
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,748
There you go.

131
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,832
Are you ready?

132
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,624
Right. There you go.

133
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,748
- You don't mind?
- No bother.

134
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,708
Last one for now then.

135
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:50,540
You want a game of doubles?

136
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:52,876
Yeah, sure.

137
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,416
You've got a built-in rest there.

138
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:59,168
No danger. I'm right-handed
and I'm playing with a kid.

139
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:00,500
Go easy.

140
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:02,792
- Do you wanna break or...?
- Yeah.

141
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:08,376
Good.

142
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,416
Well done.

143
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,248
- What's your sister's name?
- Sophie.

144
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,584
Nice.

145
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:19,960
I'm her dad though actually.

146
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,248
- Sorry, I just thought...
- That's okay.

147
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,792
- It's a nice hotel, eh?
- Yeah, it's all right.

148
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,624
We're at the one over the road,

149
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:32,540
basically a building site.

150
00:19:35,376 --> 00:19:36,416
Olly!

151
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,500
Fucking hell, Sophie, impressive.

152
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:41,124
Don't say "fuck".

153
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:43,832
- Sorry, mate.
- That's okay.

154
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,460
Well done.

155
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:51,416
I'm up. You watching?

156
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:06,856
- That's it, move it!
- No!

157
00:20:06,984 --> 00:20:09,440
You have to ruin it again for everybody,
as usual!

158
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:15,564
Twist.

159
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,564
No, keep your...
I'm not letting you off. Go again.

160
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,564
No, you're just pushing.

161
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:22,900
Look, you have to twist.

162
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:24,064
Like here.

163
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:25,732
Okay? Again.

164
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,524
Grab my wrists.

165
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,648
I get it.

166
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,564
The thin part lines up
to where the fingers connect.

167
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,272
- Are you looking?
- Uh-huh.

168
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,108
- And then you pull as hard as you can.
- Ouch!

169
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:41,900
This is serious, Sophie.

170
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:45,192
Look at me, it's important you get this.

171
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:50,940
Go.

172
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:52,564
No.

173
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:54,608
You're not twisting, you're pulling.

174
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:58,064
- Again. Grab my wrists.
- I can't twist.

175
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,484
The thin part
where the fingers connect.

176
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,400
Okay? And you pull as hard as you can.

177
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:07,484
This is serious, Sophie.

178
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,400
It's important you get this, okay?

179
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,940
So you can defend yourself.

180
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,484
So if anyone ever tries to attack you...

181
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:19,856
you can break free and get away.

182
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:24,900
What if someone tries to attack me
without grabbing my wrists?

183
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,732
<i>I think it's nice
that we share the same sky.</i>

184
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,192
What do you mean?

185
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:06,148
Well, like,

186
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:08,940
sometimes at playtime,
I look up to the sky,

187
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:11,732
<i>and if I can see the sun,</i>

188
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:14,064
<i>I think about the fact
that we can both see the sun.</i>

189
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,232
<i>So, even though we're not actually
in the same place</i>

190
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,648
<i>and we're not actually together,</i>

191
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,148
<i>we kind of are in a way, you know?</i>

192
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:27,064
<i>Like, we're both underneath</i>

193
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:29,940
<i>the same sky, so...</i>

194
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,564
<i>we're kind of together.</i>

195
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:39,856
Head under.

196
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,024
2...

197
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:42,400
3...

198
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:43,524
4...

199
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:44,648
4.5...

200
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:45,816
Stop!

201
00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:53,772
Can we do that?

202
00:22:57,732 --> 00:22:59,316
Huh?

203
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:04,064
You're too young, poppet.

204
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

205
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:40,400
<i>The marvellous, wonderful,
amazing, one-armed.</i>

206
00:23:40,564 --> 00:23:42,856
<i>Calum Aaron Patterson.</i>

207
00:23:43,772 --> 00:23:45,484
<i>Getting ready to see</i>

208
00:23:46,064 --> 00:23:48,816
<i>the evening entertainment.</i>

209
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:51,064
<i>And...</i>

210
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,648
<i>let's see.</i>

211
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:55,940
<i>Torremolinos!</i>

212
00:23:56,772 --> 00:23:58,148
<i>Are you okay, Soph?</i>

213
00:24:12,356 --> 00:24:13,900
You've not mentioned Claire.

214
00:24:15,524 --> 00:24:16,984
Um...

215
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:21,108
Remember she had a boyfriend
when we met?

216
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:23,232
Yup.

217
00:24:23,524 --> 00:24:25,044
I was like, "Who's that on the phone?"

218
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:28,692
You were like, "A girl I like,
but she's already with someone."

219
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,816
Yeah, well,
they got back together.

220
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:33,316
I liked her.

221
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,564
Uh-huh. Me too.

222
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:36,984
So does that mean
you're not gonna open the café?

223
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,400
The café?

224
00:24:39,356 --> 00:24:41,900
No, not anymore, but...

225
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,900
I got this new thing going with Keith.

226
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,272
What is it?

227
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:50,564
We're still
figuring it out exactly.

228
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,356
But we're thinking of renting a house
outside of London for work.

229
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:56,816
You'd have your own room
for when you come down.

230
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,816
Yes. Can I paint it yellow?

231
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,108
Yellow? Why yellow?

232
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,316
I like the idea.

233
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,648
But mum doesn't let me
paint my room yellow.

234
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:09,940
You're trying to get me into trouble!

235
00:25:10,484 --> 00:25:12,440
Well, can I though?

236
00:25:12,816 --> 00:25:13,900
We'll see.

237
00:25:16,856 --> 00:25:18,484
Let's watch this.

238
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:51,856
Room number?

239
00:25:52,524 --> 00:25:54,192
Soph, did you bring your wallet?

240
00:25:54,772 --> 00:25:55,984
No?

241
00:25:57,484 --> 00:25:58,648
Grab this.

242
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:00,108
Do not look at him.

243
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:02,648
On the count to three,
we throw it at the stage and run.

244
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,316
Go, run! Run, Sophie!

245
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:32,524
<i>Did it hurt?</i>

246
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,316
<i>When you fell.</i>

247
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:40,356
- When I broke my wrist?
- Uh-huh.

248
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:43,648
I don't know.

249
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:46,984
I don't really remember.

250
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,984
I didn't think it was broken,

251
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,400
I had never broken anything before.

252
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:57,400
<i>I've never broken anything before.</i>

253
00:27:04,148 --> 00:27:06,148
How come you and mum say "love you"?

254
00:27:06,316 --> 00:27:07,440
<i>What?</i>

255
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:09,316
Like, on the phone.

256
00:27:09,816 --> 00:27:12,400
You're not together.
So, why would you say it?

257
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:14,608
<i>Well...</i>

258
00:27:15,856 --> 00:27:17,984
<i>think of all the people
you say it to, like...</i>

259
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:22,108
<i>your Nana, grandad,
uncle, aunties, right?</i>

260
00:27:23,732 --> 00:27:25,232
Yeah, but they're family.

261
00:27:25,356 --> 00:27:27,148
<i>Well, your mother is family.</i>

262
00:27:41,484 --> 00:27:44,856
<i>I remember one time,
I asked mum if she'd phoned you.</i>

263
00:27:44,984 --> 00:27:47,108
<i>And she said that you were engaged.</i>

264
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,108
<i>I don't know why,</i>

265
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:53,148
<i>but I thought that meant
that you two were getting married.</i>

266
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:57,900
<i>I don't know if I thought that
about just you or both of you, but...</i>

267
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:04,064
Isn't that funny?

268
00:28:06,816 --> 00:28:08,148
Well,

269
00:28:08,356 --> 00:28:10,064
I didn't know what it meant,

270
00:28:10,192 --> 00:28:13,564
I didn't know that it meant that you
were just on the phone to somebody else.

271
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:18,232
I was kind of excited.

272
00:28:19,356 --> 00:28:20,940
<i>About us getting married?</i>

273
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,232
Yeah, I was really young though.

274
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,108
I don't know, like, seven?

275
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:33,564
How are you
getting on with the book?

276
00:28:34,232 --> 00:28:35,484
Enjoying it?

277
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:41,400
Yeah, it's a bit hard
to understand though.

278
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,108
Stick with it.

279
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:47,272
I think you'll really like it.

280
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:57,232
What does "municipal" mean?

281
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,940
<i>A proper dive, Soph.</i>

282
00:29:38,148 --> 00:29:39,524
<i>I told you, I can't.</i>

283
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:41,940
<i>- You were diving last year.
- I wasn't.</i>

284
00:29:42,064 --> 00:29:43,316
<i>Here.</i>

285
00:29:49,024 --> 00:29:50,984
<i>- Pass me my mask.
- I did.</i>

286
00:29:51,564 --> 00:29:52,692
<i>What?</i>

287
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:56,064
<i>- Come on, stop messing around.
- I'm not messing around.</i>

288
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,732
You know I didn't see you throw it.

289
00:31:01,564 --> 00:31:02,692
Throw what?

290
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,940
The mask.

291
00:31:04,064 --> 00:31:05,856
I know it was expensive.

292
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,148
It's okay, darling.

293
00:31:30,608 --> 00:31:33,400
It's fine.
I'm a little tired today, that's all.

294
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,856
Can you grab the camera?

295
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,692
It's in the bag.

296
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:59,692
Here. Put that on your foot,
then try again.

297
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:02,524
- On my foot?
- Yeah, it's gonna be much easier.

298
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,900
- Do you need help?
- Yeah, please. Thanks.

299
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,316
- Thank you.
- That's a trick of the trade.

300
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,608
It's not a bad trade.

301
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:21,856
No, not at all.

302
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:25,856
Is this what you do all year?

303
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:28,356
You're like my <i>anneanne,</i>
my mother's mum.

304
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:29,900
- Your grandma?
- Yeah.

305
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:32,148
She'd prefer that I had a proper job.

306
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,272
What is your shoe size?

307
00:32:34,524 --> 00:32:35,648
10.

308
00:32:35,772 --> 00:32:37,900
- 10.
- 44?

309
00:32:38,148 --> 00:32:39,648
- 44.
- Yeah.

310
00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:42,648
- I think these should fit.
- Yeah.

311
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,316
You know, I used to travel a lot.

312
00:32:46,484 --> 00:32:48,692
One season somewhere,
the next somewhere else,

313
00:32:48,856 --> 00:32:50,524
but now I'm here, back home.

314
00:32:50,648 --> 00:32:52,732
- And do you miss it?
- Travelling?

315
00:32:53,732 --> 00:32:55,940
Not as much as I was missing home,
to be honest.

316
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:58,356
And I'm going to have a baby soon.

317
00:32:58,524 --> 00:32:59,692
Congratulations!

318
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:03,648
A few years ago I thought
I'd be at least 40 before all that, but...

319
00:33:07,316 --> 00:33:09,484
I can't see myself at 40, to be honest.

320
00:33:12,232 --> 00:33:14,108
Surprised I made it to 30.

321
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:42,484
<i>My name is Sophie Lesley Patterson,</i>

322
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:44,316
<i>reporting live from...</i>

323
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,316
<i>I don't know the name of this boat.</i>

324
00:33:48,608 --> 00:33:51,148
<i>But I just went and saw</i>

325
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:56,197
<i>the most amazing thing
in my whole entire life.</i>

326
00:33:57,064 --> 00:33:58,148
<i>So,</i>

327
00:33:58,356 --> 00:34:01,816
<i>we went, like, scuba diving thing.</i>

328
00:34:02,148 --> 00:34:04,148
<i>And there was actually, like, a seahorse</i>

329
00:34:04,316 --> 00:34:06,316
<i>and it wrapped around my...</i>

330
00:34:06,772 --> 00:34:08,608
<i>like, whole finger.</i>

331
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:10,900
<i>Then, when I got out, there was a...</i>

332
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,064
<i>octopus!</i>

333
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,232
<i>And the instructor person,
I don't know.</i>

334
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,524
<i>Yeah, the instructor put
an octopus on my head.</i>

335
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,900
<i>A real-life octopus on my head.</i>

336
00:34:24,524 --> 00:34:25,984
<i>Yeah, but right now...</i>

337
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:30,648
<i>Dad... I mean, Calum Aaron Patterson</i>

338
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,148
<i>is away on some</i>

339
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:37,856
<i>scuba diving thing, I think.
I can't remember.</i>

340
00:34:38,064 --> 00:34:39,064
<i>But...</i>

341
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:42,524
<i>he doesn't actually have a diving license,</i>

342
00:34:42,772 --> 00:34:44,984
<i>because he told a porky pie!</i>

343
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:47,772
<i>But, yeah,</i>

344
00:34:48,316 --> 00:34:49,564
<i>he'll be fine.</i>

345
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:53,108
<i>He'll be fine, I'm sure.</i>

346
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:55,400
<i>But, yeah, bye-bye!</i>

347
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:56,692
Bye-bye!

348
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,400
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

349
00:34:58,524 --> 00:35:00,232
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

350
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:54,064
What's that?

351
00:35:56,272 --> 00:35:57,524
What?

352
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:05,524
That's just another kind of smoking,
and smoking...

353
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:06,772
Smoking causes cancer,

354
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,564
puts tar in your lungs,
and makes your teeth all yellow

355
00:36:10,692 --> 00:36:13,232
and causes your eyeballs to fall out.

356
00:36:16,148 --> 00:36:18,108
We'll go somewhere else next time.

357
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,772
It's not that bad.
When was the last time you saw Nana?

358
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,732
Right...

359
00:36:37,148 --> 00:36:38,564
Trouble.

360
00:36:38,856 --> 00:36:40,772
Watch again, okay?

361
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,816
- Okay.
- Okay?

362
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:46,984
Right, that was a bad start.

363
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:59,316
- When are you back at school?
- Tuesday.

364
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,356
- Next week?
- Really soon.

365
00:37:01,524 --> 00:37:03,108
I thought it was later.

366
00:37:05,192 --> 00:37:08,232
- Who's your new teacher?
- Miss Mackel.

367
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:10,232
The one from Glasgow?

368
00:37:15,732 --> 00:37:17,316
How do you know that?

369
00:37:20,356 --> 00:37:21,692
What?

370
00:37:24,984 --> 00:37:26,232
She's pretty.

371
00:37:27,192 --> 00:37:29,692
She's the pretty one from Glasgow!
She stuck in my head.

372
00:37:29,816 --> 00:37:31,440
Oh, my God, Dad, stop!

373
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,564
- Okay.
- Stop.

374
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:36,316
She supposed to be good?

375
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,940
We done a crossover
at the end of term.

376
00:37:40,064 --> 00:37:41,272
She seems all right.

377
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,272
<i>Insert coin.</i>

378
00:38:19,484 --> 00:38:20,524
You playing?

379
00:38:20,692 --> 00:38:23,984
- My dad's gone to get money.
- Here, watch this.

380
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,356
10p.

381
00:38:33,608 --> 00:38:35,024
Got another?

382
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:44,772
I'm Michael, by the way.

383
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:48,608
You better have been practising,
Michael.

384
00:38:48,984 --> 00:38:50,064
Harsh.

385
00:38:52,732 --> 00:38:54,108
What's your name?

386
00:38:54,692 --> 00:38:55,692
Sophie.

387
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,400
Are you joking?

388
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,564
That's 1-1.

389
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:21,940
I didn't know we were keeping count.

390
00:39:22,108 --> 00:39:23,440
Yes, you did.

391
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,740
You okay through there?

392
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,280
I don't know, I guess.

393
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,488
I just feel a bit down or something.

394
00:40:45,196 --> 00:40:46,572
What do you mean?

395
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:48,780
I don't know.

396
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,780
Don't you ever feel like

397
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:55,156
you've just done
a whole amazing day,

398
00:40:55,612 --> 00:40:59,988
and then you come home
and feel tired and down, and...

399
00:41:00,364 --> 00:41:03,156
feels like your bones don't work.

400
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,740
They're just tired
and everything is tired.

401
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:08,948
Like you're sinking.

402
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,112
I don't know, it's weird.

403
00:41:15,488 --> 00:41:17,240
We're here to have a good time.

404
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:21,532
Ready?

405
00:41:23,988 --> 00:41:25,280
Yup!

406
00:41:26,032 --> 00:41:28,740
We'll go get a nice dinner
and get an early night, yeah?

407
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,112
Yes.

408
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,488
Let's go.

409
00:41:32,404 --> 00:41:33,532
Come on.

410
00:43:11,032 --> 00:43:12,780
Do you think this one's lovely?

411
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,488
It is, actually.

412
00:43:15,988 --> 00:43:17,488
The man was telling me that

413
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:20,612
each of these carpets
tell a different story.

414
00:43:21,988 --> 00:43:23,364
The symbolism,

415
00:43:23,988 --> 00:43:26,572
the motifs,
they represent different things.

416
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,740
Oh...

417
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:34,448
- <i>Teşekkür ederim.</i>
- What?

418
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:36,988
<i>- Teşekkür ederim.
- Teşekkür ederim.</i>

419
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,904
"Tea sugar" <i>ederim.</i>

420
00:43:39,112 --> 00:43:40,740
<i>Teşekkür ederim.</i>

421
00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:42,864
- <i>Teşekkür ederim.</i>
- Oh!

422
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:44,280
You see?

423
00:43:48,864 --> 00:43:50,488
How much is this one?

424
00:43:51,488 --> 00:43:53,820
This one is 45 million Turkish lira.

425
00:43:53,948 --> 00:43:56,280
- And what's that in pounds?
- 850 pounds.

426
00:43:56,488 --> 00:43:58,404
Okay, thanks.

427
00:43:58,572 --> 00:43:59,864
You're welcome.

428
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,696
You gonna play pool?

429
00:44:29,864 --> 00:44:32,240
Why not introduce yourself
to those girls over there?

430
00:44:33,156 --> 00:44:36,864
She can play pool with us, if she wants.
There's only three of us.

431
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:40,404
- We'll play doubles.
- She's young, isn't she?

432
00:44:40,572 --> 00:44:42,656
Yeah, but she's better than him.

433
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,320
Can I go?

434
00:44:44,364 --> 00:44:45,988
Go on, then.

435
00:44:46,156 --> 00:44:47,988
An hour,
and then you come right back, okay?

436
00:44:48,112 --> 00:44:49,364
Okay.

437
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,904
Take your time, girls.

438
00:45:08,032 --> 00:45:09,072
What's that?

439
00:45:09,196 --> 00:45:10,532
It's an all-inclusive thing,

440
00:45:10,656 --> 00:45:13,156
so you can get as much as you want
of anything.

441
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,280
- That's it?
- It's the same thing.

442
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:46,280
Well, well, well,

443
00:45:46,488 --> 00:45:47,572
look who it is.

444
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,196
This is how you do it, mate.

445
00:45:53,404 --> 00:45:54,904
You don't wanna see that.

446
00:45:55,612 --> 00:45:57,032
Corrupting the youth!

447
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,488
You don't wanna see that.

448
00:46:27,612 --> 00:46:28,612
There you go.

449
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,612
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

450
00:46:52,448 --> 00:46:55,240
Gross. They've been snaking
for a fucking age.

451
00:46:55,404 --> 00:46:56,404
What?

452
00:46:56,488 --> 00:46:58,280
What the fuck is snaking?

453
00:46:58,904 --> 00:47:00,780
Why, what do you call it?

454
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:03,112
That? That's tonguing.

455
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,988
It's not, that's nipping.

456
00:47:06,404 --> 00:47:07,656
Nipping!

457
00:47:19,072 --> 00:47:20,740
Should we push them in?

458
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,280
Yeah.

459
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,864
You get him, I'll get her.

460
00:47:29,448 --> 00:47:30,904
Push 'em, yeah?

461
00:47:36,656 --> 00:47:38,032
I wanna go!

462
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,156
Okey-dokey.

463
00:50:07,488 --> 00:50:10,488
This is our room.

464
00:50:12,532 --> 00:50:17,612
And this is Dad's tiny winy bed.

465
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,904
This is my giant bed.

466
00:50:21,904 --> 00:50:23,612
Em...

467
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,820
Wait. How do I zoom?

468
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,364
Let's see. Pass it here.

469
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,156
It's this button here, see?

470
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:39,488
Oh my God, I'm on TV!
How do I look?

471
00:50:40,156 --> 00:50:42,488
Okey-dokey, give that back.

472
00:50:44,532 --> 00:50:46,196
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

473
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,032
What's that?

474
00:50:52,488 --> 00:50:54,032
Oh, my God, what even is that?

475
00:50:54,156 --> 00:50:56,156
These are my moves.

476
00:50:57,364 --> 00:51:00,320
- Stop, that's embarrassing.
- It's not embarrassing.

477
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:04,196
Wait, I was gonna interview you.

478
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:06,696
You were? What were you
gonna interview me about?

479
00:51:07,612 --> 00:51:08,696
I don't know.

480
00:51:09,488 --> 00:51:10,488
Well...

481
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:11,820
Well,

482
00:51:12,032 --> 00:51:14,156
I just turned 11.

483
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:19,320
And you are 130,

484
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,032
turning 131

485
00:51:22,156 --> 00:51:24,032
in two days.

486
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,696
So...

487
00:51:29,612 --> 00:51:31,488
when you were 11,

488
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:34,280
what did you think
you would be doing now?

489
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:43,820
Hello? What did you think
you would be doing now?

490
00:51:43,988 --> 00:51:45,988
Come on, Soph, turn that off now, okay?

491
00:51:50,196 --> 00:51:51,696
Okay, it's off.

492
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,532
Well, I can see a red light.

493
00:51:55,364 --> 00:51:57,532
That's just
because it's still on.

494
00:51:58,696 --> 00:52:01,488
It's not even on you anymore,
it's on me.

495
00:52:05,612 --> 00:52:07,032
Dad...

496
00:52:11,656 --> 00:52:13,364
Okay, it's not recording.

497
00:52:13,532 --> 00:52:16,240
I'll just record it in my little...

498
00:52:16,988 --> 00:52:18,488
mind camera.

499
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,780
Right.

500
00:52:26,904 --> 00:52:28,196
Ready?

501
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:34,072
What did you do for your 11th birthday?

502
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,740
When I was 11,

503
00:52:42,156 --> 00:52:44,532
nobody remembered it was my birthday.

504
00:52:45,656 --> 00:52:47,864
And when I told my mum,

505
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:51,780
she was so angry,
she grabbed me by the ear

506
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,988
and made my dad drive me to the toy shop
and pick something to buy.

507
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,364
That's a bit... deep.

508
00:53:01,988 --> 00:53:03,072
It's okay.

509
00:53:05,612 --> 00:53:06,864
What did you pick?

510
00:53:09,112 --> 00:53:11,780
I chose a toy phone.

511
00:53:12,696 --> 00:53:13,904
It was red.

512
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:19,196
- Good choice.
- Thank you.

513
00:53:44,656 --> 00:53:46,112
Want a sip?

514
00:53:54,032 --> 00:53:57,488
- Nice?
- Yeah, it tasted amazing!

515
00:54:18,988 --> 00:54:21,404
<i>Think you'll ever
move back to Scotland?</i>

516
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,196
<i>No.</i>

517
00:54:24,532 --> 00:54:25,820
<i>Why?</i>

518
00:54:26,988 --> 00:54:28,404
<i>There's not enough sun.</i>

519
00:54:29,196 --> 00:54:30,488
<i>Very funny.</i>

520
00:54:33,696 --> 00:54:36,032
<i>It's all in the past for me,
that's all.</i>

521
00:54:38,404 --> 00:54:39,988
<i>And there's this feeling,</i>

522
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:43,864
<i>once you leave
where you grew up, that...</i>

523
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,032
you don't

524
00:54:48,612 --> 00:54:50,488
totally belong there again.

525
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,364
Not really.

526
00:54:55,572 --> 00:54:57,364
But Edinburgh was never...

527
00:55:01,072 --> 00:55:03,612
I never felt
like I really did belong there.

528
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,488
I do. It's home.

529
00:55:11,196 --> 00:55:12,404
That's good.

530
00:55:13,904 --> 00:55:15,904
I'm glad you feel that way.

531
00:55:19,032 --> 00:55:21,196
But you never know where you'll end up.

532
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,572
You can live wherever you want to live.

533
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,988
Be whoever you want to be.

534
00:55:41,612 --> 00:55:43,032
You have time.

535
00:56:03,656 --> 00:56:04,820
It's okay.

536
00:58:13,404 --> 00:58:14,948
Top up time.

537
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,780
No, I'll do it.

538
00:58:29,112 --> 00:58:30,448
How's that working?

539
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,364
Let me help.

540
00:58:34,904 --> 00:58:36,156
No, Soph.

541
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,488
Scooch back.

542
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,196
Lift your hair a sec.

543
00:58:42,572 --> 00:58:43,656
There you go.

544
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,532
Let's do something, eh?
Get this day going.

545
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:52,904
Like what?

546
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:54,740
Water polo?

547
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,612
I'm not a good enough swimmer.

548
00:58:58,196 --> 00:59:00,404
You're a great swimmer, Soph, you know it.

549
00:59:00,988 --> 00:59:02,196
Come on.

550
00:59:02,864 --> 00:59:05,488
It's our last few days
and it will be fun.

551
00:59:07,656 --> 00:59:08,740
Up.

552
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:12,448
Up! Up! Up! Up!

553
00:59:14,072 --> 00:59:15,072
We're going swimming.

554
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,816
Hands up, hands up!

555
00:59:31,984 --> 00:59:33,984
Soph! Soph!

556
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:08,692
Could I get another one?

557
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,108
Thank you.

558
01:00:17,064 --> 01:00:19,400
What are you wearing your bikini for?

559
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,816
I don't know.

560
01:00:40,856 --> 01:00:42,524
Are you excited for tomorrow?

561
01:00:47,816 --> 01:00:48,900
Yeah.

562
01:01:05,316 --> 01:01:07,108
Are we all having fun, guys?

563
01:01:07,232 --> 01:01:08,940
- Yeah!
- Soph's having fun.

564
01:01:09,064 --> 01:01:11,772
Let's get a round of applause
for Calum and Sophie!

565
01:01:13,564 --> 01:01:14,984
You didn't sign us up?

566
01:01:15,148 --> 01:01:18,108
I did! We've done it every holiday
since I was five.

567
01:01:18,316 --> 01:01:19,984
You're a little old for it now.

568
01:01:20,148 --> 01:01:22,192
What? Those girls were, like, 50.

569
01:01:22,356 --> 01:01:25,148
Let it go, he'll move on in a second.
I'm not up for it.

570
01:01:25,356 --> 01:01:27,400
Come on, they just want to hear us.

571
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:30,316
We should be having fun.

572
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,232
Sophie, I'm not doing it, okay?

573
01:01:40,064 --> 01:01:41,564
Here we go.

574
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,356
Big applause for Sophie!

575
01:03:43,984 --> 01:03:47,400
Down you come, please. Here you are.

576
01:03:53,192 --> 01:03:56,484
We could get you singing lessons
if you wanted to learn.

577
01:03:57,692 --> 01:03:59,440
Are you telling me I can't sing?

578
01:03:59,564 --> 01:04:02,064
I'm just saying anyone can learn.

579
01:04:03,192 --> 01:04:04,484
Stop doing that.

580
01:04:05,064 --> 01:04:06,064
Doing what?

581
01:04:06,148 --> 01:04:08,900
Offering to pay
when you don't have the money.

582
01:04:25,192 --> 01:04:26,484
Come on.

583
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:28,856
Let's call it an early night.

584
01:04:28,984 --> 01:04:30,772
No, I'm staying here for a bit.

585
01:04:35,064 --> 01:04:36,524
See you upstairs, then.

586
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:38,900
Sophie?

587
01:04:41,356 --> 01:04:42,732
Not too long.

588
01:04:48,108 --> 01:04:49,148
Pass it down.

589
01:04:49,272 --> 01:04:51,064
All right, Toby, calm down.

590
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,856
I promise, I have had one too many.

591
01:04:57,984 --> 01:04:59,856
- You haven't...
- I have!

592
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,648
A couple more.

593
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,732
No, I'm being serious.

594
01:05:16,232 --> 01:05:18,356
Do you want help finding your dad?

595
01:05:19,484 --> 01:05:21,440
- Nah.
- All right.

596
01:06:10,692 --> 01:06:12,316
Can I get some water, please?

597
01:06:20,984 --> 01:06:22,524
Are you okay?

598
01:06:23,356 --> 01:06:24,732
Hanging out.

599
01:06:27,524 --> 01:06:28,692
Here.

600
01:06:37,064 --> 01:06:38,900
Boys are disgusting.

601
01:06:41,772 --> 01:06:43,108
Got it!

602
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,316
I'm going tomorrow anyway, so...

603
01:06:46,856 --> 01:06:48,856
You're staying a few more days, right?

604
01:06:48,984 --> 01:06:49,984
Yeah.

605
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,232
Now you can get whatever you want.

606
01:06:55,316 --> 01:06:57,064
- Thanks.
- It's okay.

607
01:06:58,356 --> 01:06:59,400
See you.

608
01:07:01,192 --> 01:07:02,732
What do you want?

609
01:07:02,856 --> 01:07:06,064
Can I get a Fanta lemon, please?
And I have this.

610
01:07:15,648 --> 01:07:17,272
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

611
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,984
<i>the marvellous, wonderful,
amazing, one-armed.</i>

612
01:07:20,192 --> 01:07:22,692
<i>Calum Aaron Patterson.</i>

613
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,400
<i>Getting ready to see</i>

614
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,564
<i>the evening's entertainment.</i>

615
01:07:29,524 --> 01:07:30,692
<i>And...</i>

616
01:07:31,984 --> 01:07:33,316
<i>let's see.</i>

617
01:07:34,064 --> 01:07:35,564
<i>Torremolinos!</i>

618
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,772
<i>Are you okay, Soph?</i>

619
01:08:23,316 --> 01:08:25,940
- Fuck, what did you do that for?
- I'm sorry.

620
01:08:29,524 --> 01:08:32,356
- I'm sorry, it was supposed to be a joke.
- Idiot!

621
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:33,856
Where are you going?

622
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:38,148
I should be going home, but got lost.
Everything looks the same at night.

623
01:08:38,316 --> 01:08:40,192
Why don't you come and hang out with us?

624
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,148
- What are you doing?
- Michael!

625
01:08:42,272 --> 01:08:43,356
Come on!

626
01:09:16,108 --> 01:09:18,608
I didn't know
there was another pool back here.

627
01:09:19,316 --> 01:09:20,732
Yeah, it's quiet in the day.

628
01:09:21,108 --> 01:09:23,772
And I'm not a great swimmer,
so it suits me.

629
01:09:24,524 --> 01:09:27,272
Same. I still can't dive.

630
01:09:30,356 --> 01:09:31,608
So,

631
01:09:31,856 --> 01:09:33,272
I quite like you.

632
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,356
Do you like me?

633
01:09:39,564 --> 01:09:40,856
Yes.

634
01:13:00,816 --> 01:13:02,192
Miss!

635
01:13:38,148 --> 01:13:40,564
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

636
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,940
Hey.

637
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:21,484
Are you okay?

638
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,984
Yeah.

639
01:15:40,608 --> 01:15:42,524
Happy birthday, Sophie.

640
01:15:47,856 --> 01:15:49,440
I'll get him.

641
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,316
Hello?

642
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,732
<i>This is your wake up call, sir.</i>

643
01:16:19,856 --> 01:16:20,856
Okay, thanks.

644
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,900
<i>The day trip leaves in 20 minutes.</i>

645
01:16:23,608 --> 01:16:24,648
Thank you.

646
01:16:36,484 --> 01:16:37,692
Sophie!

647
01:16:37,984 --> 01:16:40,316
Sophie, let's get up.

648
01:17:29,772 --> 01:17:31,148
Careful with those.

649
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:35,316
A man died
not putting those on properly.

650
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,608
They went up his nose
and punctured his brain.

651
01:17:39,192 --> 01:17:40,984
- That's not true.
- It is.

652
01:18:03,772 --> 01:18:05,192
Happy birthday, Dad.

653
01:18:14,108 --> 01:18:15,316
Thanks, darling.

654
01:18:38,732 --> 01:18:40,316
Okay.

655
01:18:52,108 --> 01:18:53,232
You're copying me?

656
01:18:57,564 --> 01:18:59,192
All right, smart arse.

657
01:19:02,272 --> 01:19:03,608
Attention!

658
01:19:15,564 --> 01:19:18,772
- Oh, this what we're doing?
- Yeah, I tricked you!

659
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,692
- I'm still copying you though.
- I know.

660
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:33,440
Exactly.

661
01:19:33,564 --> 01:19:35,148
Now copy this.

662
01:19:45,356 --> 01:19:46,484
Breathe.

663
01:19:53,816 --> 01:19:55,564
- Are you watching?
- Yeah.

664
01:19:55,732 --> 01:19:57,440
Feet together. Up.

665
01:20:05,316 --> 01:20:06,484
Up...

666
01:20:07,984 --> 01:20:09,232
and down.

667
01:20:10,192 --> 01:20:11,356
Up.

668
01:20:12,148 --> 01:20:13,608
And...

669
01:20:13,732 --> 01:20:15,940
Down.
Now close your eyes and do it.

670
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,232
And focus on your breathing.

671
01:20:33,192 --> 01:20:35,316
That sulphur shit fucking reeks!

672
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:42,692
- What's that smell?
- It's where we go after this.

673
01:20:45,648 --> 01:20:47,772
If it's good enough for Cleopatra...

674
01:20:49,608 --> 01:20:54,108
It's kind of amazing
how Cleopatra was right here.

675
01:20:58,064 --> 01:20:59,064
Yeah.

676
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,192
Before she was...

677
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,900
by a snake.

678
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,272
Well, it was kind of suicide.

679
01:21:06,772 --> 01:21:09,692
It wasn't sure it was a snake.
Nobody found a snake.

680
01:21:09,856 --> 01:21:12,816
- It might have been a needle.
- How do you know that?

681
01:21:12,984 --> 01:21:15,316
We learnt about Egypt last term.

682
01:21:34,148 --> 01:21:35,856
What happened to your shoulder?

683
01:21:38,524 --> 01:21:39,900
I don't really know.

684
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,940
I'm sorry I passed out in your bed.

685
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,064
It's fine.

686
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,984
I didn't have a key though.

687
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,064
- How did you get in?
- Reception.

688
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:04,064
I'm so sorry, Soph. Yesterday was...

689
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,192
It's fine, it's no big deal.

690
01:22:07,484 --> 01:22:08,984
No, it is a big deal.

691
01:22:11,984 --> 01:22:13,524
I'm sorry, okay?

692
01:22:27,648 --> 01:22:29,148
I'm sorry, okay?

693
01:22:32,316 --> 01:22:34,232
Thank you.

694
01:22:36,732 --> 01:22:38,524
You've got none on your arm.

695
01:22:38,772 --> 01:22:40,648
- I did.
- No, you don't.

696
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,772
Now you do.

697
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:45,192
- Let's see your back.
- My back?

698
01:22:45,316 --> 01:22:46,564
Yep.

699
01:22:47,272 --> 01:22:50,484
Right, I need to get a big clump
for this big back.

700
01:22:57,772 --> 01:22:59,608
Careful with my shoulder.

701
01:22:59,772 --> 01:23:00,856
It's okay.

702
01:23:00,984 --> 01:23:02,108
Sorry!

703
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,484
<i>Did you have fun last night?</i>

704
01:23:19,816 --> 01:23:20,984
<i>Yeah.</i>

705
01:23:23,192 --> 01:23:24,524
<i>This boy...</i>

706
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:26,108
<i>Michael...</i>

707
01:23:26,984 --> 01:23:29,316
<i>I met him on the motorbike game.</i>

708
01:23:30,356 --> 01:23:31,356
<i>Yeah.</i>

709
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,484
<i>We kissed, last night.
He kissed me</i>

710
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,608
<i>and then we kissed.</i>

711
01:23:40,108 --> 01:23:41,564
<i>He's your age though?</i>

712
01:23:42,148 --> 01:23:43,192
<i>Yeah.</i>

713
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:47,940
<i>Well, that's okay, right?</i>

714
01:23:48,984 --> 01:23:50,440
<i>A peck on the cheek?</i>

715
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:51,984
<i>Well...</i>

716
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,984
<i>yeah, not exactly.</i>

717
01:23:54,108 --> 01:23:55,356
<i>Okay.</i>

718
01:24:00,984 --> 01:24:03,664
<i>You know, I want you to know
that you can talk to me about anything.</i>

719
01:24:04,564 --> 01:24:06,272
As you get older, you know?

720
01:24:08,732 --> 01:24:10,648
Whatever parties you go to.

721
01:24:13,484 --> 01:24:14,984
Boys you meet.

722
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,400
Drugs you take.

723
01:24:16,524 --> 01:24:18,772
- Dad!
- No, I'm serious, Soph.

724
01:24:19,272 --> 01:24:22,940
I've done it all, so can you too.
Promise me you'll talk to me about it.

725
01:24:23,064 --> 01:24:25,484
Okay, but I'm never
gonna do any of that anyway.

726
01:24:25,648 --> 01:24:27,148
That's okay, too.

727
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,400
But if you do, remember, okay?

728
01:24:56,188 --> 01:24:58,728
On three,
we'll sing for my dad's birthday.

729
01:25:18,356 --> 01:25:20,312
3, 2, 1!

730
01:27:33,148 --> 01:27:35,980
- Should've gotten your own.
- I only wanted a taste.

731
01:27:36,148 --> 01:27:38,772
There was half of it on your spoon.

732
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:41,272
Photo?

733
01:27:41,604 --> 01:27:43,856
- How much?
- 50,000 lira.

734
01:27:44,272 --> 01:27:45,480
Sure.

735
01:27:52,228 --> 01:27:53,356
Ready?

736
01:27:59,312 --> 01:28:01,648
<i>- Teşekkür ederim.
- Rica ederim.</i>

737
01:28:18,728 --> 01:28:20,520
Did you have a good holiday?

738
01:28:20,896 --> 01:28:22,228
The best.

739
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,564
Wish we could have stayed for longer.

740
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,772
Me too.

741
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,772
What?

742
01:28:34,396 --> 01:28:36,020
I mean, why can't we?

743
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,812
What do you mean?

744
01:28:38,228 --> 01:28:40,728
Why can't we just stay here?

745
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,564
Um...

746
01:28:47,896 --> 01:28:50,272
Can't live in hotels
for the rest of our lives!

747
01:28:50,396 --> 01:28:51,396
No.

748
01:28:56,396 --> 01:28:59,188
- You can have the wafer.
- Oh, thank you very much!

749
01:29:02,648 --> 01:29:04,396
I eat it in one, yes.

750
01:29:08,896 --> 01:29:10,188
Too slow!

751
01:29:16,564 --> 01:29:18,272
Last night, time for a dance.

752
01:29:18,856 --> 01:29:20,648
- I don't dance.
- Sophie!

753
01:29:20,812 --> 01:29:22,688
I never, ever dance.

754
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:27,396
I'm dancing with or without you.
I told you, I love to dance.

755
01:29:28,228 --> 01:29:29,564
Dad, stop.

756
01:29:29,728 --> 01:29:31,856
- So embarrassing.
- This is embarrassing?

757
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:55,396
Come on!

758
01:29:55,948 --> 01:29:57,948
- Ready?
- Stop...

759
01:29:59,272 --> 01:30:00,604
Stop!

760
01:32:08,896 --> 01:32:10,520
<i>- Bye-bye
- I love you.</i>

761
01:32:10,648 --> 01:32:12,728
<i>- Safe travels.
- Bye-bye.</i>

762
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:16,604
<i>Give my love to your mum.</i>

763
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:19,460
<i>I don't need a babysitter, you know.</i>

764
01:32:56,104 --> 01:32:57,188
<i>I love you.</i>

765
01:32:57,312 --> 01:32:58,772
<i>Love you.</i>

766
01:33:00,272 --> 01:33:01,480
<i>Bye.</i>
