old lake house.

707
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:57,440
No one will find us here.

708
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:16,659
All clear.

709
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,033
Sorry about that.

710
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,109
Here.

711
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,611
Ah, you know what? You keep it.

712
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:36,145
Okay.

00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,342
This is a waste of time.

717
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:09,612
Knowing her, they're probably
shacked up somewhere.

718
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:11,714
Is there a motel around?

719
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,683
No, not really.

720
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,451
Well then, then
they've left town.

721
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:16,753
I can feel it.

722
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,521
Nah, he wouldn't leave
town with her.

723
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:19,756
How do you know?

724
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:22,625
Believe me, he's had this
like, complex

725
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:24,293
ever since his parents died.

726
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:28,197
He's like, bill's like one of
those dogs

727
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,968
with the electric fence and
the like cone.

728
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,070
And he's got like a
carrot penis.

729
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:37,106
Only instead of a yard,

730
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:40,643
it's this whole town he
can't escape.

731
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,346
Yeah, it must be
tough for a cop.

732
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:45,248
That public knowledge?

733
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,449
Everybody pretty much knows

734
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:48,685
everybody else's
business around here.

735
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,054
I guess that's why there
aint no paparazzi.

736
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:54,457
Paparazzi. I loathe the term.

737
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,160
I'm a celebrity journalist.

738
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,495
I hold the mirror up
to our culture,

739
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:00,997
reflecting it back
more accurately

740
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:02,331
than any history book.

741
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:03,933
The trades ancestry goes back

742
00:45:03,935 --> 00:45:05,668
to the apostles themselves.

743
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,139
Whoa! The apostles.

744
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,951
You gonna stay like
that all night?

745
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,954
I'm fine.

746
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,592
You think maybe we should
put the fire out?

747
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:31,627
I mean maybe they could
smell the smoke or...

748
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:33,296
But you know, we
could go outside.

749
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:34,764
And use the cabin as a decoy.

750
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:37,867
Uh, I'm going to choose not
to worry about it.

751
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:42,472
Yeah, okay. I suppose, you
know, you're used to this.

752
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,407
Ice in your veins and all.

753
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,908
One would think.

754
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,053
How many people have you killed?

755
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:58,321
- Bill!
- Sorry.

756
00:45:58,323 --> 00:45:59,789
I've done what I had to do.

757
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:00,723
I understand, yep.

758
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:02,525
You're probably good
under pressure,

759
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:04,393
being cop's in your genes,
right?

760
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,297
My father and I didn't have
much in common.

761
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,565
Ever think about being chief?

762
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:10,800
I'm through with this line
of questioning.

763
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,137
Touchy subject. I forgot.

764
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,438
Mmmm.

765
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,244
You think I'm simple, don't you?

766
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,045
What? No.

767
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:25,915
You think 'cause I'm some
hick from small town

768
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:28,184
who hasn't had any real
crime, I'm not a real cop.

769
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:29,752
I never said that.

770
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,589
My father died when I was nine

771
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:37,160
and after he passed I took
responsibility for this town.

772
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:38,761
This town is my life.

773
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,998
How'd he die?

774
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,168
Drunk driver. Killed them both.

775
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,869
[Whispers] Ohhh.

776
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:50,606

777
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:51,808
What?

778
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:52,909
Stay here.

779
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,556
I think I'm probably
done for tonight.

780
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,496
Good night nikki.

781
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,019
Bill?

782
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,456
Yeah?

783
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,660
Thank you.

784
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:20,950
Oh my god!

785
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:23,486
Bidding war for
nikki gold sex tape?

786
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:26,389
Whatever happened to our
old camcorder, may?

787
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:27,456
This is not funny.

788
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,792

I came from bill's.

790
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,197
I wanted to uh,
I wanted to apologize

791
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:38,167
for being such a, a wad
these past few days.

792
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:39,835
But he, he wasn't there

793
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:42,038
there, there were just these,
these photographers.

794
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,573
Like, like ravens on roadkill.

795
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:46,042

796
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:47,910
There, there's some right
across the street.

797
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,681
Ah, well now thanks for
the heads up, son.

798
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:56,218
You go on home. Uh, I'll take
care of everything.

800
00:50:58,256 --> 00:50:59,989
Now I gotta go tell bill.

801
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,967
So?

802
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:14,003
Oh yeah, yeah. He's got her
stashed somewhere.

803
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,373
And if I know the chief, he's
gonna lead us right to the
henhouse.

804
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,308
The henhouse?

805
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,710
Yeah, I thought it was, I
thought it would sound cool.

don't think.

Yeah, it's pretty, right?

812
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:46,202
It reminds me of the town

Where's that?

814
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:50,106
It's a little town in

parents got divorced.

- What?
- Rabbit.

819
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,956
