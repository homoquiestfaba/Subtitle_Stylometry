1
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,753
Well!

2
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,206
I didn't think the Mingotts
would have tried it on.

3
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,504
Parading her at the opera.

4
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:45,439
Sitting her next to May Welland.
Iùs all very odd.

5
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,976
Well, she's had such an odd life.

6
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,922
Will they bring her
to the Beauforts' ball?

7
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,084
If they do, the talk
will be of little else.

8
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,949
Good evening, Mrs. Welland, May.

9
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,211
Newland.

10
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,647
You know my niece, Countess Olenska.

11
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,000
Countess.

12
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,444
I hope you've told Madame Olenska.

13
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,514
What?

14
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,379
That we're engaged.

15
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,849
I want everybody to know.

16
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,521
Let me announce it at the ball.

17
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,320
If you can persuade Mama.

18
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,426
Why should we change what is settled?

19
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:06,657
But you can tell my cousin yourself.
She remembers you.

20
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,331
I remember we played together.

21
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,038
How this brings it all back to me.

22
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:18,340
I remember everybody
in knickerbockers and pantalettes.

23
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,251
You were horrid.

24
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,153
You kissed me once behind a door.

25
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:40,225
But it was Vandy, who never
looked at me, that I loved.

26
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:48,506
- You have been away a very long time.
- Centuries and centuries.

27
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,771
So long, I'm sure I'm dead
and this dear place is heaven.

28
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,618
<i>It invariably happened, </i>
<i>as everything did in those days... </i>

29
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,562
<i>... in the same way. </i>

30
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,689
<i>As usual... </i>

31
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:51,102
<i>... Mrs. Julius Beaufort appeared, </i>
<i>unaccompanied by her husband... </i>

32
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,331
<i>... just before "The Jewel Song."</i>

33
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:57,632
<i>And, again as usual, </i>
<i>rose at the end of the third act... </i>

34
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,610
<i>... and disappeared. </i>

35
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,978
<i>New York then knew</i>
<i>that a half-hour later... </i>

36
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:07,312
<i>... the Beauforts' annual</i>
<i>opera ball would begin. </i>

37
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:26,103
<i>Carriages waited at the curb</i>
<i>for the entire performance. </i>

38
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:30,039
<i>It was known in New York</i>
<i>but never acknowledged... </i>

39
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,905
<i>... that Americans want</i>
<i>to leave amusement... </i>

40
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,942
<i>... even more quickly</i>
<i>than they want to get to it. </i>

41
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:52,824
<i>The Beauforts' house was one of</i>
<i>the few in New York with a ballroom. </i>

42
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:58,169
<i>Such a room, shuttered in darkness</i>
<i>364 days of the year... </i>

43
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:03,470
<i>... was felt to compensate for whatever</i>
<i>was regrettable in the Beaufort past. </i>

44
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,235
<i>Regina Beaufort came from</i>
<i>an old South Carolina family. </i>

45
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,376
<i>But her husband, Julius, </i>
<i>who passed for an Englishman... </i>

46
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,187
<i>... was known to have dissipated</i>
<i>habits, a bitter tongue... </i>

47
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,620
<i>... and mysterious antecedents. </i>

48
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:21,021
<i>His marriage assured him</i>
<i>a social position... </i>

49
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,888
<i>... but not necessarily respect. </i>

50
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,203
<i>Newland Archer hadn't stopped at</i>
<i>his club, as young men usually did... </i>

51
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,739
<i>... but came directly to the ball. </i>

52
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,503
<i>He wanted the announcement</i>
<i>of his engagement... </i>

53
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,244
<i>... to divert gossip away</i>
<i>from the countess... </i>

54
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:18,215
<i>... and show his most ardent support</i>
<i>for May and her whole family. </i>

55
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,225
<i>The Beaufort house had been</i>
<i>boldly planned. </i>

56
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:32,229
<i>Instead of squeezing through</i>
<i>a passage to get to the ballroom... </i>

57
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:37,633
<i>... one marched solemnly down a vista</i>
<i>of enfiladed drawing rooms. </i>

58
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:56,117
<i>But only by passing through</i>
<i>the crimson drawing room... </i>

59
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,222
<i>... could one see</i>
The Return of Spring...

60
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,692
<i>... the much-discussed nude</i>
<i>by Bouguereau... </i>

61
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:07,856
<i>... which Beaufort had had</i>
<i>the audacity to hang in plain sight. </i>

62
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,309
<i>Archer enjoyed such challenges</i>
<i>to convention. </i>

63
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,937
<i>He questioned conformity in private... </i>

64
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,315
<i>... but in public he upheld</i>
<i>family and tradition. </i>

65
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,614
<i>This was a world balanced</i>
<i>so precariously... </i>

66
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,084
<i>... that its harmony could be</i>
<i>shattered by a whisper. </i>

67
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:57,747
<i>On the whole, Archer was amused by</i>
<i>the smooth hypocrisies of his peers. </i>

68
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,351
<i>He may even have envied them. </i>

69
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,444
<i>Lawrence Lefferts, for instance... </i>

70
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,187
<i>... was New York's foremost</i>
<i>authority on form. </i>

71
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,724
<i>His opinion on pumps</i>
<i>versus patent-leather oxfords... </i>

72
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,863
<i>... had never been disputed. </i>

73
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,399
<i>On matters of surreptitious romance... </i>

74
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,165
<i>... his skills went unquestioned. </i>

75
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:40,551
<i>Old Mr. Sillerton Jackson was</i>
<i>as great an authority on family... </i>

76
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,394
<i>... as Lawrence Lefferts was on form. </i>

77
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:48,331
<i>The mean and melancholy history of</i>
<i>Countess Olenska's European marriage... </i>

78
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,404
<i>... was a buried treasure</i>
<i>he hastened to excavate. </i>

79
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,439
<i>He carried, like a calling card... </i>

80
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,239
<i>... an entire register</i>
<i>of the scandals and mysteries... </i>

81
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,379
<i>... that had smoldered under</i>
<i>the unruffled surface of society... </i>

82
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,109
<i>... for the last 50 years. </i>

83
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,291
<i>Now, Julius Beauforùs secret</i>
<i>was the way he carried things off. </i>

84
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:21,092
<i>He could arrive casually at his</i>
<i>party as if he were another guest... </i>

85
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,797
<i>... and might leave early... </i>

86
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:27,439
<i>... for a more modest but comforting</i>
<i>address in the East 30s. </i>

87
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,667
<i>He was intrepid in his business... </i>

88
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,378
<i>... but in his personal affairs, </i>
<i>absolutely audacious. </i>

89
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:42,954
<i>Archer's fiancÈe was innocent of all</i>
<i>these intrigues and of much else. </i>

90
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:47,925
<i>May Welland represented for Archer</i>
<i>all that was best in their world... </i>

91
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:52,725
<i>... all that he honored. </i>
<i>And she anchored him to it. </i>

92
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,561
I've told my friends,
just as you asked.

93
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,131
I couldn't wait.

94
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,976
- I wish it hadn't been at a ball.
- But even here we're alone.

95
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:10,072
The worst of it is that
I want to kiss you and I can't.

96
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,927
Did you tell Ellen as I asked you to?

97
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,794
I didn't have a chance after all.

98
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,866
She's my cousin.
If others know before she does...

99
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,165
She's been away for so long.
She's rather sensitive.

100
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,304
I'll tell her.
But I didn't see her yet.

101
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:42,479
- She didn't come at the last minute.
- At the last minute?

102
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,550
She thought her dress
wasn't smart enough.

103
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,748
We thought it was lovely,
but she asked to be taken home.

104
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,318
Oh, well.

105
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,872
Very handsome.

106
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,544
Very liberal.

107
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:17,844
In my time, a cameo set in pearls
was thought to be sufficient.

108
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,985
But iùs the hand that sets off
the ring, isn't it?

109
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,612
The setting shows
the stone beautifully.

110
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,058
But it looks bare
to old-fashioned eyes.

111
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:32,427
I hope you don't mean mine, my dear.
I like all the novelties.

112
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:37,569
My hands were modeled in Paris by
the great Rochet. He should do May's.

113
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:38,933
Show me, child.

114
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,664
Her hand is so tempered.

115
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,009
These modern sports spread the joints.

116
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,442
But the skin is white.

117
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,113
When's the wedding?

118
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,016
Soon, if only you'll back me up,
Mrs. Mingott.

119
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,884
We must give them time
to know each other better.

120
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,124
Know each other?

121
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,820
Everyone in New York
has always known everyone.

122
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,927
Don't wait till the bubble's off
the wine. Marry before Lent.

123
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:10,067
I may catch pneumonia, and I want
to give the wedding breakfast.

124
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,636
What a kind offer.

125
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,968
<i>Even if she hadn't been</i>
<i>May's grandmother... </i>

126
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,768
<i>... Mrs. Manson Mingott would</i>
<i>have been the first to receive... </i>

127
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,611
<i>... the required betrothal visit. </i>

128
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,307
<i>She was not only the matriarch</i>
<i>of this world... </i>

129
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,150
<i>... she was nearly its dowager empress. </i>

130
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,449
<i>Much of New York was related to her... </i>

131
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:32,521
<i>... and she knew the remainder</i>
<i>by marriage or by reputation. </i>

132
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,057
<i>Though brownstone was the norm... </i>

133
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,129
<i>... she lived magisterially</i>
<i>within a large house... </i>

134
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:41,997
<i>... of controversial pale, </i>
<i>cream-colored stone... </i>

135
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:46,660
<i>... in an inaccessible wilderness</i>
<i>near the Central Park. </i>

136
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,539
<i>The burden of her flesh</i>
<i>had long since made it impossible... </i>

137
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,178
<i>... for her to climb stairs. </i>

138
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,646
<i>So with characteristic</i>
<i>independence... </i>

139
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:59,741
<i>... she had established herself</i>
<i>on the ground floor of her house. </i>

140
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:04,849
<i>From her sitting room, there was</i>
<i>an unexpected vista of her bedroom. </i>

141
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:10,184
<i>Her visitors were fascinated by</i>
<i>the foreignness of this arrangement... </i>

142
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:13,460
<i>... which recalled scenes</i>
<i>in French fiction. </i>

143
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:18,727
<i>This was how women with lovers</i>
<i>lived in the wicked old societies. </i>

144
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,172
<i>But if she had wanted a lover... </i>

145
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,175
<i>... the intrepid woman</i>
<i>would have had him too. </i>

146
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,405
<i>For now, she was content simply... </i>

147
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:31,773
<i>... for life and passion</i>
<i>to flow northward to her door... </i>

148
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:36,119
<i>... and to anticipate eagerly</i>
<i>the union of Newland Archer... </i>

149
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,189
<i>... with her granddaughter, May. </i>

150
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,851
<i>In them, two of New York's</i>
<i>best families... </i>

151
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,990
<i>... would finally</i>
<i>and momentously be joined. </i>

152
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,561
- Goodbye, Mama.
- Goodbye.

153
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:47,857
Ellen.

154
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,670
Beaufort, this is a rare favor.

155
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,798
Unnecessarily rare, I'd say.

156
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,212
I met Countess Ellen,
and she let me walk home with her.

157
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,908
This house will be merrier
now that she's here.

158
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,717
- Thank you.
- Beaufort, pull up that tuffet.

159
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,082
I want a good gossip.

160
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,051
You already know about May and me.

161
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,724
She scolded me for not telling you.

162
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,124
Of course I know, and I'm so glad.

163
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,093
One doesn't tell such news
first in a crowd.

164
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,356
Careful there.

165
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,200
Don't catch your ring on your sleeve.

166
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,565
Goodbye.

167
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,000
Goodbye.

168
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,276
Come and see me someday.

169
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,716
Iùs a mistake for Ellen to parade up
5th Avenue with Julius...

170
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,285
...at the crowded hour...

171
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,721
...the very day after her arrival.

172
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,589
He's so flagrant. Even his wife
must know about Annie Ring.

173
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:03,740
<i>Sillerton Jackson enjoyed his</i>
<i>frequent visits to the Archer home... </i>

174
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,436
<i>... more than the actual dining. </i>

175
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,278
<i>Newland Archer's mother... </i>

176
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:13,113
<i>... and his sister Janey were both</i>
<i>shy women and shrank from society. </i>

177
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:17,686
<i>But they liked to be well-informed</i>
<i>and doted on their bachelor friend. </i>

178
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,324
Certain nuances escape Beaufort.

179
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,159
Necessarily.
Beaufort is a vulgar man.

180
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:28,163
Not in business. Most of New York
trusts him with its affairs.

181
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,063
My Grandfather Newland
always told Mother:

182
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,272
"Don't let that Beaufort
be introduced to the girls."

183
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,311
At least he's had the advantage
of association with gentlemen.

184
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,473
<i>The Archers and the Mingotts</i>
<i>were the sturdiest branches... </i>

185
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,578
<i>... of New York's tangled family tree. </i>

186
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:50,651
<i>Granny Mingoùs family could</i>
<i>embrace May's traditionalism... </i>

187
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,824
<i>... and tolerate Ellen's</i>
<i>unconventionality. </i>

188
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,521
<i>But Archer's family held fast</i>
<i>to the old ways. </i>

189
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:01,627
<i>His mother and sister relied</i>
<i>on him for every security. </i>

190
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,165
<i>He would always be, </i>
<i>Mrs. Archer assured May's mother: </i>

191
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,373
<i>"Their strong right hand."</i>

192
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,272
Was our new cousin at the ball?

193
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,573
I appreciate the Mingotts' support
of her, having her at the opera.

194
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,245
I admire their esprit de corps.

195
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,884
But why my son's engagement...

196
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,355
...should be mixed up with her comings
and goings, I don't see.

197
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,755
In any case, she was not at the ball.

198
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,553
At least she had that decency.

199
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,867
Does she wear a round hat
or a bonnet in the afternoon?

200
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,802
The dress she wore
to the opera was so plain.

201
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,668
- It was in better taste not to go.
- It wasn't taste.

202
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,808
May said Ellen decided
her dress wasn't smart enough.

203
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,844
Poor Ellen.

204
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:51,211
We must always remember
the eccentric bringing-up she had.

205
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,046
What can you expect of a girl who wore
black satin at her coming-out ball?

206
00:20:56,955 --> 00:21:00,982
Iùs odd she kept such an ugly name
as Ellen when she married the count.

207
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,189
I'd have changed it to Elaine.

208
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,088
Why?

209
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,932
I don't know.

210
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,456
It sounds more...

211
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,265
...Polish.

212
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,463
It sounds more conspicuous.
That can hardly be what she wishes.

213
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,910
Why shouldn't she be conspicuous
if she chooses?

214
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:23,072
She made an awful marriage,
but should she hide her head?

215
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,417
Should she slink around
as if she disgraced herself?

216
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,546
She's had a sad life.
That doesn't make her an outcast.

217
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,925
I'm sure thaùs the line
the Mingotts mean to take.

218
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,521
I needn't wait for their cue,
if thaùs what you mean.

219
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:44,697
I'm told she's looking for a house.
She intends to live here.

220
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,971
I hear she means to get a divorce.

221
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,565
I hope she will.

222
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:56,572
Understandably, her marriage
was intolerable.

223
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,610
- There are the rumors too.
- I've heard them.

224
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,145
The secretary.

225
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,389
He helped get her away
from the husband.

226
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,963
They say the count kept her
practically a prisoner.

227
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,194
Certainly the count
had his own way of life.

228
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,972
- You knew him?
- I heard of him at Nice.

229
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,941
Handsome, they say...

230
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,376
...but eyes with a lot of lashes.

231
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,413
When he wasn't with women...

232
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,451
...he was collecting china.

233
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,954
Paying any price for both,
I understand.

234
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,387
Then where's the blame?

235
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:44,688
Any one of us would have helped the
countess, just as the secretary did.

236
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,293
He was still helping her a year later.

237
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,433
Somebody met them
living together at Lausanne.

238
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,038
Living together?

239
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,509
Why not? She has the right
to make her life over.

240
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:02,104
Why bury a woman alive
if her husband prefers whores?

241
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,981
Iùs hardly a question of entombment.

242
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,051
The countess is here, after all.

243
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:13,547
Or do you believe a woman
should share the same freedoms as men?

244
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,221
I suppose I do. Yes, I do.

245
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:21,088
Apparently Count Olenski
takes a similarly modern view.

246
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,865
I never heard of him lifting a finger
to get his wife back.

247
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,167
<i>Three days later, </i>
<i>the unthinkable happened. </i>

248
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,635
<i>Mrs. Manson Mingott</i>
<i>sent out invitations... </i>

249
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,946
<i>... summoning everyone</i>
<i>to a formal dinner. </i>

250
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:41,517
<i>Such an occasion demanded</i>
<i>the most careful consideration. </i>

251
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,384
<i>It required the appropriate plate. </i>

252
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,716
<i>It called for three extra footmen... </i>

253
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:51,425
<i>... two dishes for each course</i>
<i>and a Roman punch in the middle. </i>

254
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,725
<i>The dinner, read the invitation... </i>

255
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,365
<i>... was "to meet the Countess Olenska."</i>

256
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,701
<i>And New York declined. </i>

257
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,206
<i>"Regret, unable to accept."</i>

258
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,344
And from our own family.

259
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,585
No one cares enough...

260
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:18,646
...to conceal their feelings about
the countess. This is a disgrace.

261
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:22,092
<i>They all lived in a kind of</i>
<i>hieroglyphic world. </i>

262
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,823
<i>The real thing was never said</i>
<i>or done or even thought... </i>

263
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:30,294
<i>... but only represented</i>
<i>by a set of arbitrary signs. </i>

264
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:36,232
<i>Archer knew these signs. They were</i>
<i>not subtle and were not meant to be. </i>

265
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,200
<i>They were more than a simple snubbing. </i>

266
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,374
<i>They were an eradication. </i>

267
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,308
<i>There was a single court of appeal. </i>

268
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:49,279
<i>He would plead their case</i>
<i>before the van der Luydens. </i>

269
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:54,585
And all this, you think, is due
to some intentional interference by...

270
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,927
Larry Lefferts. I'm certain of it.

271
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,487
<i>The van der Luydens dwelled</i>
<i>above all the cities' families... </i>

272
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,400
<i>... in a kind of</i>
<i>superterrestrial twilight. </i>

273
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:09,236
<i>Archer appealed to their exquisitely</i>
<i>refined sense of tribal order. </i>

274
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,839
<i>And he spoke plainly. </i>

275
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:15,708
Whenever poor Gertrude Lefferts begins
to suspect her husband of something...

276
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:20,110
...Larry makes some great diversionary
fuss to show how moral he is.

277
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,148
Iùs the principle that I dislike.

278
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:29,324
I mean, if a member of a well-known
family is backed by that family...

279
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,893
...it should be considered final.

280
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,899
We felt this slight on the countess
shouldn't pass without consulting you.

281
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,995
We're giving a dinner for our cousin,
the Duke of St. Austrey...

282
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,531
...who arrives next week
on the <i>Russia. </i>

283
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,671
I'm sure Louisa will be
as glad as I am...

284
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:52,642
...if Countess Olenska will let us
include her among our guests.

285
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,649
<i>The occasion was a solemn one. </i>

286
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,458
<i>But the countess arrived</i>
<i>rather late... </i>

287
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:07,464
<i>... signaling a carelessness</i>
<i>of which she was entirely unaware. </i>

288
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,160
<i>She entered, without haste</i>
<i>or embarrassment... </i>

289
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,936
<i>... the drawing room in which</i>
<i>New York's most chosen company... </i>

290
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,803
<i>... was somewhat awfully assembled. </i>

291
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,771
Countess Olenska.

292
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,377
Good evening.

293
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,709
We're delighted you're here.

294
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,019
The Duke of St. Austrey.
May I present Countess Olenska.

295
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,681
<i>The Trevenna George II plate was out. </i>

296
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,992
<i>So was the van der Luyden Lowestoft</i>
<i>from the East India Company... </i>

297
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,961
<i>... and the Dagonet Crown Derby. </i>

298
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,555
<i>Dining with the van der Luydens</i>
<i>was, at best, no light matter. </i>

299
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,070
<i>Dining there with a duke</i>
<i>who was their cousin... </i>

300
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,335
<i>... was almost a religious solemnity. </i>

301
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,908
<i>When the van der Luyden's chose, </i>
<i>they knew how to give a lesson. </i>

302
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,983
Excuse me.

303
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,591
<i>It was not the custom in New York... </i>

304
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,720
<i>... for a lady to get up</i>
<i>and walk away from one gentleman... </i>

305
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,257
<i>... in order to seek</i>
<i>the company of another. </i>

306
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,159
<i>But the countess</i>
<i>did not observe this rule. </i>

307
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,234
I want you to talk to me about May.

308
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,409
You knew the duke before?

309
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,979
From Nice.

310
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:10,348
We saw him every winter. He's fond of
gambling and came to our house often.

311
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:15,717
He wears the same suit every evening.
He thinks it brings him luck.

312
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,993
He's the dullest man I ever met.

313
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,326
But he seems to be admired here.

314
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,332
May I tell you what most
interests me about New York?

315
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,575
Not all the blind obeying
of somebody else's tradition.

316
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,147
It seems stupid to make America
a copy of another country.

317
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:40,810
Would Columbus have taken such trouble
just to go to the opera with Lefferts?

318
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:51,628
If he'd known Larry Lefferts were
here, he might never have left port.

319
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,098
And May? Does she share these views?

320
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,327
If she does, she'd never say so.

321
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,671
Are you very much in love with her?

322
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,969
As much as a man can be.

323
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,039
Do you think there's a limit?

324
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,579
If there is, I haven't found it.

325
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,381
Iùs really and truly a romance then.

326
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,883
Not in the least arranged?

327
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,559
In our country, we don't allow
our marriages to be arranged.

328
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,892
Yes, I forgot. I'm sorry.

329
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,929
I sometimes make these mistakes.

330
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,604
I don't always remember
that everything here is good...

331
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,902
...that was bad where I came from.

332
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,248
I'm so sorry.

333
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,722
But you know you are
among friends here.

334
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,759
Yes, I know. Thaùs why I came home.

335
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,893
You'll want to be with May.

336
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,968
She's already surrounded
by so many rivals.

337
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,505
Then stay with me a little longer.

338
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,508
Yes.

339
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,547
Mr. Urban Dagonet,
the Countess Olenska.

340
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,414
- How do you do, my dear?
- How do you do?

341
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,553
Tomorrow then, after 5,
I'll expect you.

342
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,226
Tomorrow.

343
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,955
Excuse me.

344
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,932
It was good of you
to devote yourself...

345
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,742
...to Madame Olenska
so unselfishly, dear Newland.

346
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,814
I told Henry
he really must rescue you.

347
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,647
I think I've never seen May
looking lovelier.

348
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,755
The duke thinks her
the handsomest woman in the room.

349
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,221
Mr. Archer.

350
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,363
So how do you like
this odd little house?

351
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,193
To me, iùs like heaven.

352
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,900
You've arranged it delightfully.

353
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,063
Some of the things
I managed to bring with me.

354
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,737
Little pieces of wreckage.

355
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,377
At least iùs less gloomy
than the van der Luydens'...

356
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,176
...and not so difficult to be alone.

357
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,043
I'm sure iùs often thought
the van der Luydens' is gloomy...

358
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,386
...though I've never
heard it said before.

359
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,547
Do you really like to be alone?

360
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,654
As long as my friends keep me
from being lonely.

361
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,761
I see you've already chosen
your corner.

362
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,764
- Please, sit.
- Thank you.

363
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,964
This is the hour I like best.

364
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,670
Don't you?

365
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,912
I was afraid you'd forgotten the hour.

366
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,881
I'm sure Beaufort
can be very intriguing.

367
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,282
He took me to see some houses.

368
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:14,857
I'm told I must move, even though this
street seems perfectly respectable.

369
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,927
- Yes, but iùs not fashionable.
- Fashionable?

370
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,294
Is fashion such
a serious consideration?

371
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,865
Among people with nothing
more serious to consider.

372
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,099
Perhaps I've been too independent.

373
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:35,343
All I really want is to feel
cared for and safe.

374
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,384
The van der Luydens
do nothing by halves.

375
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,353
All New York laid itself out
for you last night.

376
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,014
It was so kind. Such a nice party.

377
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,927
Cream or lemon?

378
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:53,998
Lemon, please.

379
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,934
The van der Luydens are the most
powerful influence in society.

380
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,937
They very seldom receive because
of Cousin Louisa's health.

381
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,532
- Perhaps thaùs the reason then.
- Thank you. The reason?

382
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,172
For their influence.
They make themselves so rare.

383
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,778
But of course you must tell me.

384
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,246
No, iùs you telling me.

385
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,491
Then we can both help each other.

386
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,494
But I need help so much more.

387
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,190
There are so many people already...

388
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,931
...to tell you what to do.

389
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:37,234
I think they're all a little angry
with me for setting up for myself.

390
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,637
Still, your family can advise you,
show you the way.

391
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,980
Is New York such a labyrinth?

392
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,813
I thought it was all straight
up and down, like 5th Avenue.

393
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,815
All the cross streets numbered...

394
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,988
...and big honest labels
on everything.

395
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,649
Everything is labeled...

396
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,651
...but everybody is not.

397
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,157
I must count on you for warnings too.

398
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,058
All the older women like you.
They want to help.

399
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,130
I know. As long as they don't hear
anything unpleasant.

400
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:15,204
Does no one here want
to know the truth, Mr. Archer?

401
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,310
The real loneliness is living
among all these kind people...

402
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,710
...who only ask you to pretend.

403
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,420
No, you mustn't.

404
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,060
Madame Olenska.

405
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,599
Ellen...

406
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,331
Does no one cry here, either?

407
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,300
I suppose there's no need to.

408
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,023
<i>Oh, Mr. Archer, good evening. </i>

409
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,460
We didn't see you and weren't
sure whether to send Miss Welland...

410
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,599
Lilies of the valley.
Leùs make it a standing order.

411
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,533
Very good, sir.

412
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:20,042
And those yellow roses.
I'll give you another address.

413
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,110
Very good.

414
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,677
Mr. Archer. Two separate orders.

415
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,320
- They'll go at once?
- At once.

416
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,649
Iùs wonderful to wake
with lilies of the valley.

417
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,116
Iùs like being with you.

418
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,018
They came late yesterday, I know.
Time got away from me.

419
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,088
But still, you always remember.

420
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,558
I sent roses to Ellen too.
Was that right?

421
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,956
Very right.

422
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,664
She didn't mention it
at lunch today, though.

423
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,724
She got some wonderful orchids
from Mr. Beaufort...

424
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,399
...and a hamper of carnations
from Henry van der Luyden.

425
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:26,142
She was so very delighted.
Don't people send flowers in Europe?

426
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,180
- I know you consider it a long time.
- Very long.

427
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:35,185
But the Chivers were engaged for a
year and a half, the Lefferts for two.

428
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,517
Mama expects something customary.

429
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,156
Since you were little, you've had
your way. You're almost 22.

430
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,489
Just tell your mother what you want.

431
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,889
I can't refuse her the last thing
she'd ask of me.

432
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,756
Can't we just strike out
for ourselves?

433
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,998
Shall we elope?

434
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,864
If you would, why not?

435
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,800
You do love me, Newland.
I'm so happy.

436
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,041
Well, why not be happier?

437
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,714
I couldn't be happier, dearest.

438
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:09,276
I showed Ellen the ring. She thought
it was the most beautiful setting.

439
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,984
She said there was nothing like it
in the Rue de la Paix.

440
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,590
I do love you, Newland.

441
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,855
Everything you do is so special.

442
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,065
<i>I want to call on your legal skills</i>
<i>for a rather delicate matter. </i>

443
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,238
Countess Olenska wants
to divorce her husband.

444
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,968
Iùs been suggested
she means to marry again...

445
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,742
...although she denies it.

446
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,574
I beg your pardon,
but because of my engagement...

447
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,078
...perhaps another member
of the firm could consider this.

448
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,081
Precisely because of your
prospective alliance...

449
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,414
...and considering members
of the family asked for you...

450
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,188
...l'd like you to consider it.

451
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,455
Iùs a family matter. Perhaps iùs
best settled by the family.

452
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,262
Their position is clear.

453
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:57,392
They're entirely and rightly
against a divorce.

454
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,794
But Countess Olenska
still insists on a legal opinion.

455
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,501
But, really, whaùs the use
of a divorce?

456
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,241
She's here.

457
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,368
He's there.

458
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,813
The whole Atlantic's between them.

459
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,079
As things go,
Olenski's acted generously.

460
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,844
He's returned some of the money
without being asked.

461
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,517
She'll never get
a dollar more than that.

462
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,726
Although I understand she attaches
no importance to the money.

463
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:29,663
Considering all that, the wisest thing
is to do as the family say.

464
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,564
Just let well enough alone.

465
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,371
I think thaùs for her to decide.

466
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:49,813
Have you considered the consequences
if the countess decides for divorce?

467
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,748
- Consequences for the countess?
- For everyone.

468
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:57,594
I don't think the counùs accusations
are anything more than vague charges.

469
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,356
It will make for some talk.

470
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:03,099
I've heard talk about the countess
and the secretary...

471
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,397
...even before I read
the legal papers.

472
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,398
Iùs certain to be unpleasant.

473
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,332
Unpleasant?

474
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:13,405
Divorce is always unpleasant,
don't you agree?

475
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,646
Naturally.

476
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,546
Then I can count on you?

477
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:22,982
The family can count on you to use
your influence against a divorce?

478
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:27,350
I can't promise that.
Not until I've talked to the countess.

479
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,387
I don't understand you.

480
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:34,596
You want to marry into a family
with a divorce hanging over it?

481
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:39,726
I don't think that has anything
to do with the case.

482
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,638
Can someone take this to the countess?

483
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,912
You refuse such an invitation
on threat of death.

484
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,277
Is it so bad?

485
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,984
Not if you have a taste
for slow agony.

486
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:03,182
- I've neglected to cultivate that.
- Three days with the van der Luydens!

487
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:06,526
- Take your fur and a hot-water bottle.
- Is the house that cold?

488
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,096
- No, but Louisa is.
- Mr. Archer.

489
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:14,102
Come to Delmonico's on Sunday. I'm
having an oyster supper in your honor.

490
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:18,037
Private room, congenial company,
artists and so on.

491
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,643
Thaùs tempting. I haven't met
a single artist since my arrival.

492
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,578
I know some painters I could
bring to see you.

493
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,343
Painters? Are there
any painters in New York?

494
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:33,519
Thank you, but I was really thinking
of singers, actors, musicians...

495
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,418
...dramatic artists.

496
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,694
There were always so many
at my husbanÔs house.

497
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:43,393
May I let you know tomorrow?
Iùs too late to decide tonight.

498
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,234
Is this late?

499
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:49,262
Yes, because I still have to talk
business with Mr. Archer.

500
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,711
Of course, Newland...

501
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:59,180
...if you can persuade the countess
to change her mind...

502
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,307
...you can join us too.

503
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,212
You know painters, then?
You live in their milieu?

504
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,316
- Not exactly.
- But you care about such things?

505
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:13,388
Immensely. When I'm in Europe,
I never miss an exhibition.

506
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,594
I try to keep up.

507
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,733
I used to care immensely too.

508
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:20,463
My life was full of such things.

509
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:25,139
But now I want to cast off all
my old life to be an American...

510
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,072
...and be like everyone else.

511
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,008
I doubt you'll ever quite
be like everybody else.

512
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,751
Don't say that. I want to put
all the old things behind me.

513
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,410
I know.

514
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,879
Mr. Letterblair told me.

515
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,881
Mr. Letterblair?

516
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:45,158
Yes, I've come because he
asked me to. I'm in the firm.

517
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,458
You mean iùll be you who'll
manage everything for me?

518
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:53,792
- I can talk to you. Thaùs easier.
- Yes, I'm here to talk about it.

519
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,272
I've read all the legal papers.

520
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,867
And the letter from the count.

521
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,339
It was vile.

522
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:12,118
But if he chooses to fight,
he can say things that might be un...

523
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:20,558
That are disagreeable to you.
Say them publicly...

524
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,765
...so that they could be
damaging even if...

525
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:25,926
lf...?

526
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:31,033
Even if they were unfounded.

527
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:36,437
What harm could accusations
like that do me here?

528
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,145
Perhaps more harm than anywhere else.

529
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:44,514
Our legislation favors divorce,
but our social customs don't.

530
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,379
Never?

531
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,189
Well, not if the woman...

532
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,362
...has appearances...

533
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,628
...in the least degree against her,
has exposed herself...

534
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,801
...by any unconventional behavior...

535
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:05,432
...to offensive insinuations and...

536
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,776
Yes. So my family tell me.

537
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,010
Our family. You'll be my cousin soon.

538
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,185
And you agree with them?

539
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,892
What could you possibly gain
that would make up for the scandal?

540
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,032
My freedom.

541
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,468
But aren't you free already?

542
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,212
Iùs my business to help you
see these things...

543
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:50,818
...the way people who
are fondest of you see them.

544
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:55,914
If I didn't show you how they judge
such matters, it wouldn't be fair.

545
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,590
No, it wouldn't be fair.

546
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,407
Very well.

547
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,171
I'll do as you wish.

548
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,507
I do want to help you.

549
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,885
You do help me.

550
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,788
Good night, cousin.

551
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,342
<i>For mercy's sake, </i>
<i>don't cry so bitterly. </i>

552
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,140
<i>-Forget what I've done! </i>
<i>-On one condition. </i>

553
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:54,048
I accept it, whatever it may be.

554
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,386
Never speak a word of love
to me again.

555
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,148
Never!

556
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,224
On my honor.

557
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,179
Heaven bless you.

558
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:48,697
Farewell.

559
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,572
Iùs fascinating.

560
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:27,873
Every season, same play, same scene,
same effect on the audience.

561
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,772
Remarkable, isn't it?

562
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,377
I'm enjoying this more than in London.

563
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:36,985
Do you see this play when you travel?
I'd travel to get away from it.

564
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,521
- Was it a dinner?
- A reception at Mrs. Struthers'...

565
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:42,057
...given on the LorÔs day...

566
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,561
...but with champagne
and singing from the tabletops.

567
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,494
People say there was dancing.

568
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,394
It was a French Sunday then?

569
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:54,730
Dissipation can be wonderfully
energizing in the early stages...

570
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:03,169
Do you think her lover will send her a
box of yellow roses tomorrow morning?

571
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:15,181
I was thinking about that too.

572
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,061
The farewell scene.

573
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,928
Yes, I know.

574
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,533
It touches me as well.

575
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,970
I usually leave after that scene,
to take the picture away with me.

576
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,615
I had a letter from May
from St. Augustine.

577
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:44,279
They always spend the winter there,
on account of her mother's bronchitis.

578
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,250
And what do you do while May is away?

579
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,427
I do my work.

580
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:11,772
I do want you to know
what you advised me was right.

581
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:15,378
Things can be so difficult sometimes...

582
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,085
...and I'm so grateful.

583
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:37,434
<i>The next day, Newland Archer searched</i>
<i>the city in vain for yellow roses. </i>

584
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:40,175
<i>He sent a note to Madame Olenska... </i>

585
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:45,271
<i>... asking to call that afternoon</i>
<i>and requesting a reply by messenger. </i>

586
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:49,150
<i>There was no reply that day</i>
<i>or the next. </i>

587
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:53,416
<i>And when yellow roses</i>
<i>were again available... </i>

588
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,884
<i>... Archer passed them by. </i>

589
00:49:56,259 --> 00:50:00,127
<i>It was only on the third day</i>
<i>that he heard from her by post... </i>

590
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,254
<i>... from the van der Luydens' home. </i>

591
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:07,703
"Newland, I ran away the day after
I saw you at the play...

592
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,966
...and these kind friends took me in.

593
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:13,572
I wanted to be quiet
and think things over.

594
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:17,508
I feel so safe here.
I wish that you were with us.

595
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:20,078
Yours sincerely."

596
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:27,552
<i>He had received an invitation from the</i>
<i>Lefferts for a weekend on the Hudson. </i>

597
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:30,123
<i>He hoped it was not too late to reply. </i>

598
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:34,423
<i>Their house was not far</i>
<i>from the van der Luydens'. </i>

599
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:50,439
I came to see what you ran away from.

600
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,910
- I knew you'd come.
- That shows you wanted me to.

601
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,583
May wrote she asked you
to take care of me.

602
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,722
- I didn't need to be asked.
- Why?

603
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,156
Am I so helpless and defenseless?

604
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,694
Or are women here so blessed
they never feel need?

605
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,195
What sort of need?

606
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:10,926
Oh, please, don't ask me.
I don't speak your language.

607
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:18,070
Henry left the patroon house open
for me. I want you to see it.

608
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,945
When you wrote me, you were unhappy.

609
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:34,620
Yes, but I can't feel unhappy
when you're here.

610
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,528
I shan't be here long.

611
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,029
I know.

612
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:49,829
If you really wanted me to come...

613
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:54,742
...if I'm really to help you...

614
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,782
...you must tell me
what you're running from.

615
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,460
Is he what you're running from?

616
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,031
Or what you expected?

617
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,432
I didn't know he was here.

618
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:03,346
Hello, Beaufort.

619
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,281
This way. Madame Olenska
was expecting you.

620
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:10,376
You've certainly led me
on a bit of a chase.

621
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:16,655
All this way just to tell you I've
found the perfect house for you.

622
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,830
Iùs not on the market yet,
so you must take it now.

623
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:25,561
Well, Archer. Rusticating?

624
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,311
<i>That night he did not take</i>
<i>the customary comfort... </i>

625
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,348
<i>... in his monthly shipment</i>
<i>of London books. </i>

626
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,852
<i>The taste of the usual</i>
<i>was like cinders in his mouth. </i>

627
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,548
<i>There were moments</i>
<i>when he felt as if he were... </i>

628
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,585
<i>... being buried alive</i>
<i>under his future. </i>

629
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:56,695
<i>Newland, come late tomorrow. </i>
<i>I must explain to you. Ellen. </i>

630
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,723
- Has anything happened?
- Yes.

631
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:26,758
I found I had to see you.

632
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,230
What is it?

633
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,767
Nothing.

634
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,374
Tell me what you do all day.

635
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,413
There are a few very
pleasant people...

636
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:47,746
...from Philadelphia and Baltimore
picnicking at the inn.

637
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:50,817
And the Merrys are setting up
a lawn tennis court...

638
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:54,286
...but nobody here has really
heard of the game yet, so...

639
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,324
I have my racket
and so does Kate Merry...

640
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:13,442
I came here because I thought I could
persuade you to break away from that.

641
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,535
To advance our engagement.

642
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:20,642
Don't you understand how much
I want to marry you?

643
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,451
Why should we dream away another year?

644
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,647
I'm not sure I do understand.

645
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:31,983
Are you not certain of feeling
the same way about me?

646
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,588
What on earth do you mean?

647
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,830
Is there someone else?

648
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,163
Someone else?

649
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,801
Between you and me?

650
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,340
Leùs talk frankly, Newland.

651
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,912
I've felt a difference in you,
especially since our engagement.

652
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:55,017
- What?
- Lf iùs untrue, it won't hurt to talk.

653
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:59,420
And if it is true, we should talk.
You mighùve made a mistake.

654
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:03,788
If I'd made a mistake, would I be
asking to hurry our marriage?

655
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,994
I don't know. You might.

656
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:09,463
Iùd be one way to settle
the question.

657
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,004
In Newport, two years ago...

658
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:18,302
...before we were promised...

659
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,100
...everyone said there
was someone else for you.

660
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:25,480
I saw you with her, sitting together
on a veranda at a dance.

661
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:28,745
When she came into the house,
her face looked so sad...

662
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:32,680
...I felt sorry for her.
Even after, when we were engaged...

663
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,886
...I could still see how she looked...

664
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,288
Is that all you've been
concerned about?

665
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,394
Iùs long past.

666
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:47,967
Then is there something else?

667
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,366
No.

668
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,437
Of course not.

669
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:54,508
Whatever it may have been...

670
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:58,377
...I can't have my happiness made out
of a wrong to someone else.

671
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:02,107
If promises were made, or if
you feel pledged to this person...

672
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:07,022
...even if it means her divorce,
don't give her up because of me.

673
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,488
There are no pledges.

674
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,753
There are no promises that matter.

675
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:18,032
Thaùs all I've been trying to say.
There is no one between us, May.

676
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:23,765
Which is precisely my argument
for getting married...

677
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,438
...quickly.

678
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:37,779
<i>He could feel her dropping back</i>
<i>to inexpressive girlishness. </i>

679
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:41,123
<i>Her conscience had been</i>
<i>eased of its burden. </i>

680
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:43,091
<i>"It was wonderful," he thought... </i>

681
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,992
<i>..."how such depths</i>
<i>of feeling could coexist... </i>

682
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,962
<i>... with such an absence</i>
<i>of imagination."</i>

683
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:54,466
- And did you succeed?
- No.

684
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:57,640
I'd still like to be married
in April, with your help.

685
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:01,770
- Now you're seeing the Mingott way.
- Is this really so difficult?

686
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:05,944
The family is difficult.
Not one of them wants to be different.

687
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:09,049
And when they are,
they end up like Ellen's parents.

688
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:11,779
Nomads. Continental wanderers.

689
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:13,951
Dragging Ellen about.

690
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:17,717
Lavishing on her an expensive
but incoherent education.

691
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:23,155
Out of them all, there's not one that
takes after me but my little Ellen.

692
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,534
You've got a quick eye. Why in
the world didn't you marry her?

693
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:33,971
For one thing, she wasn't
there to be married.

694
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,008
No, to be sure.

695
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,510
And she's still not.

696
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:40,978
The count, you know...

697
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,310
...wrote to Mr. Letterblair.

698
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:45,983
He wants her back.

699
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:48,486
On her own terms.

700
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:52,854
The count doesn't defend himself,
I will say that.

701
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:56,995
And Ellen will be losing
a great deal if she stayed here.

702
00:58:57,233 --> 00:59:00,168
There's her old life:
gardens at Nice...

703
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:03,865
...jewels, of course,
music and conversation.

704
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,435
She says she goes unnoticed in Europe.

705
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:10,804
But I know her portraiùs
been painted nine times.

706
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:14,876
All this, and the remorse
of a guilty husband.

707
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,310
I'd rather see her dead.

708
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:19,722
Would you really?

709
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:25,353
We should remember marriage is
marriage, and Ellen is still a wife.

710
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:29,231
Ellen! See who's here!

711
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:34,566
Yes, I know. I went to see your
mother to ask where you'd gone.

712
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:41,107
Since you never answered my note,
I was afraid you might be ill.

713
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,711
He was in a rush
to get married, thaùs why.

714
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:48,183
Off the train and straight here.
He wants me to use my influence...

715
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:50,946
...to marry his sweetheart sooner.

716
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:53,414
Well...

717
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:58,226
Surely between us we can persuade
the Wellands to do as he wishes.

718
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:01,195
Newland, you see?
Right to the problem, like me.

719
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,062
I told him he shoulÔve married you.

720
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,326
And what did he say?

721
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:11,069
Oh, my darling,
I leave you to find that out.

722
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:21,341
I wish I didn't have to leave.
I'll see you soon, I hope.

723
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,183
Fine.

724
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,947
I'll see you out.

725
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:29,451
When can I see you?

726
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:52,640
The Struthers are sending
the carriage at 7.

727
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:57,508
Good evening.

728
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:01,149
Who's so ridiculous to send a bouquet?

729
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:04,084
I'm not going to a ball,
and I'm not engaged.

730
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:07,826
Nastasia.
Some people are always ridiculous.

731
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,932
Take these to that nice family
down the street.

732
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,098
Well...

733
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:22,307
...in almost everything she says
there's something true...

734
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,012
...and something untrue.

735
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,207
Why?

736
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:27,675
What has Granny been telling you?

737
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,452
She believes you might
go back to your husband.

738
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:37,458
I think she believes you might
at least consider it.

739
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,858
A lot of things have been
believed of me.

740
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:46,263
But if she thinks I'd consider it,
it also means she'd consider it for me.

741
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:51,097
As Granny is weighing your idea
of advancing the marriage.

742
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:04,349
May and I had a frank talk in Florida.

743
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:08,454
Iùs probably our first.

744
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:13,062
She wants a long engagement
to give me time.

745
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,760
Time for what?

746
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:22,071
She thinks I want
to marry her at once...

747
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,370
...to get away from someone...

748
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,007
...that I care for...

749
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:28,634
...more.

750
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,610
Time to give her up for another woman?

751
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,113
If I want to.

752
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:43,457
Iùs very noble.

753
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:44,720
Yes.

754
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:47,620
Iùs ridiculous.

755
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:49,998
Why?

756
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,160
Because there is no other woman?

757
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:54,970
No.

758
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,838
Because I don't mean
to marry anyone else.

759
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:09,212
This other woman.
Does she love you too?

760
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:13,148
There is no other woman.
The person May meant was never...

761
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:23,158
That must be your carriage.

762
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:24,898
Yes...

763
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,300
...I suppose I should be leaving soon.

764
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:34,203
To Mrs. Struthers?

765
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,240
Yes.

766
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:41,745
I must go where I'm invited
or I should be too lonely.

767
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:48,319
Why not come with me?

768
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,714
May guessed the truth.

769
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,754
There is another woman.

770
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,055
Only not the one she thinks.

771
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,801
Don't make love to me.
Too many have done that.

772
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,670
I never have. I'd have
married you had it been possible.

773
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,672
- Iùs you who made it impossible.
- I've made it?!

774
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,311
You made me give up divorcing.

775
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:46,280
You talked to me, in this house,
about sacrifice...

776
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,316
...and sparing scandal!

777
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,852
For you and May, I did what you asked!

778
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:55,949
- The things in your husbanÔs letter...
- I had nothing to fear from that.

779
01:04:56,392 --> 01:05:00,726
I was just afraid of scandal
for the family and you and May.

780
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,034
Nothing's...

781
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,606
Nothing's done that can't be undone.

782
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,313
I'm still free.

783
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,715
You can be too.

784
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,615
Please.

785
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:10,058
Can I marry May now?
Do you see me marrying May now?

786
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,764
I don't see you
asking May that, do you?

787
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,631
I have to. Iùs too late
to do anything else.

788
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:19,965
You say that because iùs the easiest
thing to say, not because iùs true.

789
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,909
I don't understand you.

790
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:26,745
Because you don't realize
how you've changed things for me.

791
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,180
- You don't know all that you've done.
- All I've done?

792
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,853
All the good things you've done
for me that I never knew.

793
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:38,324
Going to the van der Luydens
because people refused to meet me.

794
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,929
Announcing your engagement
at the ball...

795
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,558
...so there would be two families
behind me instead of one.

796
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,368
I never understood how dreadful
people thought I was.

797
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:53,305
Granny blurted it out one day.
I was stupid. I never thought...

798
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:58,242
New York meant freedom to me.
Everyone seemed so kind...

799
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,812
...and glad to see me.

800
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:08,116
They never knew what it meant to be
tempted, but you did. You understood.

801
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,391
I'd never known that before...

802
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,998
...and iùs better
than anything I've known.

803
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:24,995
Newland, you couldn't be happy
if it meant being cruel.

804
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:31,377
If we act any other way, you'll act
against what I love in you most.

805
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,483
And I can't go back
to that way of thinking.

806
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:41,013
Don't you see? I can't love you
unless I give you up.

807
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:27,833
"Ellen, Granny's telegram succeeded.
Mama agreed to marriage after Easter.

808
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:30,403
Only a month.
I will telegraph Newland.

809
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,807
I'm too happy for words and love you
dearly. Your grateful cousin, May."

810
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:57,362
<i>There had been wild rumors... </i>

811
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:02,936
<i>... until the wedding that Mrs. Mingott</i>
<i>would actually attend the ceremony. </i>

812
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:06,166
<i>She had sent a carpenter</i>
<i>to measure the front pew... </i>

813
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:09,409
<i>... in case it might be altered</i>
<i>to accommodate her. </i>

814
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:12,343
<i>But this idea, </i>
<i>like the great lady herself... </i>

815
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:17,110
<i>... was unwieldy, and she settled</i>
<i>for giving the wedding breakfast. </i>

816
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:23,855
<i>The Countess Olenska sent her regrets. </i>
<i>She was traveling with an aunt. </i>

817
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:28,291
<i>But gave the bride and groom</i>
<i>an exquisite piece of old lace. </i>

818
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:33,330
<i>Two elderly aunts in Rhinebeck</i>
<i>offered a honeymoon cottage. </i>

819
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:38,370
<i>Since it was thought "very English"</i>
<i>to have a country house on loan... </i>

820
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:40,804
<i>... their offer was accepted. </i>

821
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:44,705
<i>When the house proved suddenly</i>
<i>uninhabitable, however... </i>

822
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,571
<i>... Henry van der Luyden offered... </i>

823
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:51,314
<i>... an old cottage</i>
<i>on his property nearby. </i>

824
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:55,386
<i>May accepted the offer</i>
<i>as a surprise for her husband. </i>

825
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:59,891
<i>She'd never seen the house, </i>
<i>but her cousin Ellen had mentioned it. </i>

826
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:03,258
<i>She had said it was</i>
<i>the only house in America... </i>

827
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:06,898
<i>... where she could imagine</i>
<i>being perfectly happy. </i>

828
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:12,904
<i>They traveled to the expected places, </i>
<i>which May had never seen. </i>

829
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:18,012
<i>In London, Archer ordered his clothes. </i>
<i>They went to the National Gallery... </i>

830
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,513
<i>... and to the theater. </i>

831
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:24,382
I hope I don't look ridiculous.
I've never dined out in London.

832
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:27,784
English women dress like
everyone else in the evening.

833
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:32,993
How can you say that when they're
at the theater in old ball dresses?

834
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:36,292
Maybe they save their
new dresses for home.

835
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:40,660
- Then I shouldn't have worn this.
- You look very fine.

836
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:44,072
Really, quite beautiful.

837
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:53,275
<i>In Paris, she ordered her clothes. </i>

838
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:56,050
<i>There were trunks of dresses</i>
<i>from Worth. </i>

839
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:58,416
<i>They visited the Tuileries. </i>

840
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:10,258
<i>May's hands were modeled</i>
<i>in marble at Rocheùs studio. </i>

841
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:13,033
<i>And occasionally, they dined out. </i>

842
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:22,009
But tell me, you were saying you were
actually advised by Maupassant?

843
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:25,944
Unfortunately, I was advised
not to write.

844
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,983
<i>Archer embraced his new marriage... </i>

845
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:35,385
<i>... even as he reverted</i>
<i>to his old ideas about matrimony. </i>

846
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:38,957
<i>It was less trouble</i>
<i>to conform with tradition. </i>

847
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:42,096
<i>There was no use trying</i>
<i>to emancipate a wife... </i>

848
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:44,860
<i>... who hadn't the dimmest notion</i>
<i>that she wasn't free. </i>

849
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:48,330
In London we only managed
one day at the National.

850
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:52,038
We were taken up
by a Mrs. Carfry and Mrs. Harle.

851
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:54,836
We had a good talk.

852
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:59,773
He's interesting. We talked about
books and many different things.

853
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,617
I thought I'd invite him to dinner.

854
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:04,414
- The Frenchman?
- Yes.
