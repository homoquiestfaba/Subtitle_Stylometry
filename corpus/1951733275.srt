1
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,832
What's your poison?

2
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,900
Tequila.

3
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,810
- No lime, no salt.
- Coming right up.

4
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:48,412
Man, I never saw anybody drink tequila
like that and still read the Bible.

5
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,752
It's exactly the kind of medicine
this town needs.

6
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:55,624
- You know what I mean?
- I know exactly what you mean.

7
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,469
Look, you fucking loser.
You owe us two grand.

8
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,969
We want our fucking money.

9
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,168
- Hit him!
- Pay up, fool!

10
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,005
Asshole!

11
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:17,877
Quit messing around
and pay us our damn money.

12
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,891
Back off, man. 
It's none of your business.

13
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,057
God damn it, get out of the way,
or we're going to beat you, too.

14
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,295
Hey, mister. Step back.

15
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,985
- That was good.
- Shit.

16
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:21,446
Hey, mister. 
Thanks a lot. I'm Billy.

17
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,577
Which way to the cemetery?

18
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:34,090
Up that way. Over the bridge.
You can't miss it.

19
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,322
My... My hat, mister.

20
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,868
My condolences.

21
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:46,184
I guess I could say a few words
for our dearly departed brother

22
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,027
from the book of Samuel.

23
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:10,114
"The Lord brings death 
and makes alive,

24
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,448
"he brings down to the 
grave and raises up.

25
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:21,355
"The Lord sends poverty and wealth,
he humbles, he exalts.

26
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:26,227
"He raises the poor from the dust,
and the needy from the ash heap,

27
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,668
"he seats them with princes

28
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,830
"and has them inherit 
a throne of honor."

29
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,673
Amen.

30
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,864
Excuse me.

31
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,377
You read from the Bible.
It was very kind of you.

32
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,137
Thanks.

33
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,982
You got a minute?
I'd like to introduce you to the family.

34
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,426
This is my father, White Deer.

35
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,398
And this is my son, Junior.

36
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,439
This is my daughter, Kiowa.

37
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,906
Everybody loved JJ.
Did you serve together?

38
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,185
- You could say that.
- Were you in his unit?

39
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,756
'Cause I don't see you in the pictures.

40
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,691
- You know, they say he drowned in a river.
- Yeah, right.

41
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,379
Take your hat off.

42
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:39,317
There's a heck of a nice bike out there.
Who does that belong to, you?

43
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:47,530
I don't believe we've met. John Reno.
A pleasure.

44
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,692
Are you... You a friend 
of JJ's, are you?

45
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,704
Yeah, well, he's a good man.
You going to stay with us long?

46
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,635
Maybe.

47
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:01,975
Well, I heard about
your little adventure in town, there.

48
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,512
Trying to help that druggie kid out?

49
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,054
I got to tell you, it's no offense,
but you're wasting your time.

50
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,213
Ain't much of your business.

51
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,588
Anyway, you need anything,
you let me know, all right?

52
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,492
You said you were from up north,
is that right?

53
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,032
Boy, boy, he's talking to you.

54
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:28,195
Peace, brother.
This is a time for mourning, not fighting.

55
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,246
Murph, not yet.

56
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,786
Let go of me.
And don't you ever touch me again.

57
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,794
Easy, darling, I'm not going to hurt you.

58
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,963
Prettiest girl in town,
won't give me the time of day.

59
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,067
How you figure that, Murph?

60
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:00,070
Look, I'm all broke up about JJ,
just like you are. He's a friend of mine.

61
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:04,438
Besides, I... I just want to warn you...

62
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:08,911
A lot of bad things happening
in this town to people right now,

63
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,450
especially folks who don't
mind their own business.

64
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:17,077
You understand? Saddle up, fellas.

65
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,585
Come see me at the dealership.

66
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,966
Hi, there. What can I get you, mister?

67
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,783
- I guess I'll settle for a room.
- Okay. Well, let's see.

68
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:24,550
Since we only get a few customers
each week, I think we can fit you in.

69
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,683
- Staying long?
- How much for a week?

70
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,758
Okay. Well, let's see. That's 50 bucks a day,

71
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:38,063
and one day free
for our seven-day special rate.

72
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,263
Let's call it an even 300.

73
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,835
You must be here for the funeral.

74
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,246
JJ was a good man. Great carpenter.

75
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:56,385
Used to help me with the little things
around here, whenever he had the time.

76
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,716
201.

77
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,424
If you need anything, just let me know.

78
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,432
Will do.

79
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,142
- Is that him?
- No fucking way.

80
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,906
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's him.

81
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,973
That motherfucker.
Who's he think he's messing with?

82
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,780
Back off, hound dog.

83
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,622
- He's at the hotel, boss.
- He's at the hotel.

84
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,623
Why don't you thrill me
with your analysis, Murph.

85
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,990
What do you think he is? ATF, Fed, what?

86
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,962
It's kind of hard to tell.

87
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,625
The folks down at the funeral
said he's pretty harmless.

88
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:22,935
I mean, he reads the Bible, drinks tequila.
Pretty much keeps to himself.

89
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,100
I see.

90
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,646
He took us by surprise, boss.
It's not going to happen again.

91
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,215
It better not happen again.

92
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:38,222
So from now on,
it's just going to be business as usual

93
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,682
here on this great reservation.

94
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,227
Yeah, right. Business as usual, boss.

95
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,497
You just keep a goddamn eye
on our mystery man.

96
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,796
- What?
- The biker with the fucking Bible, Gomez.

97
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,669
Pay attention.

98
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,175
I want you to put a couple of men on him.
Especially tonight.

99
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,006
I don't want any problems,
not with this shipment,

100
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:04,013
and I don't want people thinking
I'm starting to lose my grip

101
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,710
on this miserable excuse for a town.
You understand?

102
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:12,620
- Sure thing, boss.
- Murph? Murph?

103
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:16,182
- Yes, sir, boss.
- Good.

104
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:24,359
Come on, Reno. Come over here and ride me
like the cowboy I know you are.

105
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,598
I'm here, darling. I'm going to saddle you up
like a quarter horse.

106
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:33,177
Shaved just like I like it.
You taste like a peach.

107
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,293
Heard you were a friend of JJ's.

108
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,965
- That's right.
- Well, that's real nice.

109
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,401
Funeral's over. He's dead and buried.

110
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,549
So what are you still doing here?

111
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,931
I've got my eyes on you. Remember that.

112
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,468
Stay out of trouble.

113
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:13,040
Oh, my lovely young bird.
Hurt, angry, lonely and nowhere to fly.

114
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:19,507
He didn't drown.
JJ knew something about Reno.

115
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,321
Oh, sweetheart,
I know how close you were to JJ.

116
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,956
He was like a father to you.

117
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,829
But you have to think
of the rest of the family now.

118
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:46,040
We have to be careful. Reno can do just
about anything he wants to in this town.

119
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,237
He didn't drown.

120
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,196
You're upset about JJ, huh?

121
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,327
Do you really think
that Reno tried to kill him?

122
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,064
- It's crazy.
- I just can't take it anymore.

123
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:21,669
But, Kiowa, if that happened to him because
of what we're trying to do, what about us?

124
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,177
JJ was right.

125
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:32,254
I mean, other Tribal Council members
might be on Reno's side.

126
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,018
That's crazy.

127
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,421
Let's see what happens. I bet JJ was right.

128
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:25,339
The Council meeting is getting ready
to start, so everyone come in.

129
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:02,879
Welcome, everyone.
This Tribal Council is in session.

130
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:09,319
We are finally ready to decide on two
proposals for this Council from last month.

131
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:16,251
I wanted to postpone
today's meeting, because of JJ.

132
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:21,594
We all loved him. He was one of the most
respected members of this Council.

133
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:29,406
Assistant Chief Lance suggested
we still discuss the Gaming 3 proposal.

134
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,070
The Tribal Council has carefully studied
and weighed the advantages

135
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,842
and disadvantages of both proposals.

136
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:43,478
We've had a proposal for the building
of a casino on the Tribal property,

137
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:47,149
by Lance's construction group.

138
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:55,195
This proposal would bring many new jobs
and much revenue for our people.

139
00:23:55,333 --> 00:24:01,602
However, I'm very concerned with the many
negative aspects of this proposal.

140
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:07,511
For now, there's a very innovative
on-line gaming alternative,

141
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:13,812
proposed by the late JJ,
his sister Nancy and their family.

142
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,685
This proposal offers
more highly-skilled jobs

143
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:23,284
and training for our people,
and takes advantage of the gaming profits

144
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,329
without the negative aspects.

145
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,997
I will recommend this proposal
to the Council.

146
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:40,845
- And as you all know, my veto counts.
- Dan, we need to rethink this.

147
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,639
There is too much money on the table
for this tribe to lose.

148
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,747
I'm sorry. My decision is final.

149
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,866
- This is ridiculous.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

150
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,433
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

151
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,583
So, how was everything?

152
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,786
Not bad.

153
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:35,126
Well, I don't know how to say this,

154
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:41,266
- but you don't look like a mean, old biker.
- Now, why is that?

155
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,864
For starters, you wear
funny-looking reading glasses,

156
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,779
and you read the Bible, and drink tequila.

157
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,373
And just the way you talk and treat people.

158
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,982
I heard about that fight this morning.

159
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:00,054
It's a really nice thing you did
for that kid, Billy, and all.

160
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,423
- So I don't want to be prying, but...
- Then don't.

161
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,583
Hey, dude. Dude, come here.
I heard you were still here, man.

162
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:37,460
I'm just... Just thought
I'd let you know that... There was...

163
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:42,297
Those guys you beat up, man?
They work for this guy, Reno.

164
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,792
The guy runs the whole town.
He's got everybody scared.

165
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,235
You know what I mean...

166
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,506
Reno, huh?

167
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,840
Yeah, man. These guys, they...

168
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:01,947
They drowned somebody in the river,
if you know what I mean.

169
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,788
I know exactly what you mean.

170
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:11,462
- You want some coffee?
- No.

171
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:20,099
- So what's on your mind?
- Everybody's favorite citizen, Reno.

172
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:25,302
- We have to do something about him.
- Well, it ain't that simple.

173
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,643
The last time I tried to have an investigation,
it was called off quickly, by that judge.

174
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,374
JJ's drowning was no accident.

175
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:38,853
Nancy, we're all going to miss JJ,

176
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,222
but accusing Reno
is not going to bring him back.

177
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,489
And it's only going to cause
more problems for you.

178
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,327
Come on, Sheriff.

179
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,066
Now, you be careful.

180
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:57,334
Stay out of Reno's way,
because he's a very dangerous man.

181
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,038
Come back anytime.

182
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,315
You have a nice day, okay?

183
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,582
That's it?

184
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,885
That's it.

185
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,524
Now, when I was a boy,

186
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,031
the government came and took me away
from my mother and dad,

187
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,660
and put me in what they call
a residential school.

188
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,103
They cut my hair off. My hair was long.

189
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,273
And I couldn't speak my language.

190
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,676
If I spoke my language, they would beat me.
That's why a lot of people my age

191
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:40,740
can't speak our language anymore,
because it was beaten out of us.

192
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:52,260
I am looking at the eagle up there.
You share the same fate.

193
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:57,192
You are destined to soar free,
above all others,

194
00:28:57,302 --> 00:29:02,137
carried by the wind
and feared by those below.

195
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:13,006
Now, in our culture, four is a sacred number
because everything grows in fours.

196
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:20,252
The seed, the branches
and the fruit and the leaves.

197
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:25,592
And when we pray, we pray to the Creator,
we pray in four directions.

198
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:31,795
And the four winds come in four directions.
So four is a very sacred number for us.

199
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,246
Don't worry about it.
Mom will take care of it.

200
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,777
- You coming?
- I'm going to wait here.

201
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:11,206
Hey, there. I'll just take some of these.

202
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:17,212
So that day my Uncle JJ drowned,
he came here first, right?

203
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,178
- So what?
- I'm just asking.

204
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,449
Look...

205
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,890
He came in, got a case of beer.

206
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,793
And the Sheriff has already
asked me about that.

207
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,526
They said he was drunk when he drowned.

208
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,297
- Yeah, I heard.
- You know he didn't drink.

209
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:54,746
Who was the beer for, then? Reno?
'Cause Reno drinks beer.

210
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,887
- Hey, was Reno with him that day?
- Look, I'm busy.

211
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,892
- You're such a loser.
- You want to pay for that?

212
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:19,066
Good afternoon, miss.
Can I help you with those candy bars?

213
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,847
I heard that you
were at the Tribal Council meeting today.

214
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,884
What did the old fools have to say?
Anything interesting?

215
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,250
Hey, just let him go.

216
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,620
I asked you a question, little lady.
Anything interesting?

217
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:38,889
Yeah.
But it's above your kindergarten education.

218
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:44,065
That's wasn't very nice.

219
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,136
You need to tell
your mother something for me.

220
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,240
She needs to drop
that idiotic gaming proposal of hers.

221
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,037
Hey, that's none of your business.
Just let him go.

222
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,113
He's just fine.

223
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,239
- How old are you, sweetheart?
- Fifteen.

224
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,284
Nice, nice, nice.

225
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,752
How'd you like to come hang out at the pool
with me and the boys?

226
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,881
We sure would love to see you in a bikini.

227
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:12,793
Yeah... But you know what?
Maybe we don't even have to go anywhere.

228
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,670
Hey, hey. Come on, man.
Look, I don't think this is such a good idea.

229
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,073
- She's just a kid.
- What, are you going soft on us, Hoss?

230
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,612
Get over there and do your fucking job.

231
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,306
Since when did we become child molesters?

232
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,280
Just back off, man.

233
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:44,261
You just keep on riding, mister.
This ain't none of your business.

234
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,698
Everything you do from now on
is my business.

235
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:57,138
You fucking asshole.
We own this town, and the Sheriff included.

236
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,516
No, stop! He tried to helped me.

237
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,997
All right, man. Get out of here.

238
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:39,209
- I'm fine. I think so.
- Are you sure?

239
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,546
- I'll take you home. All right?
- All right.

240
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,984
You follow. Let's go.

241
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:04,905
- Why don't you come have some dinner?
- My mom's a really good cook.

242
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:17,714
Haven't had home cooking in a while,
especially not this good.

243
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:27,187
Hey, thanks for what you did.
Nobody stands up to Reno.

244
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:30,267
His family's got too many
connections in this town.

245
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:34,895
People like Reno,
you just got to stand up and fight back.

246
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,599
For some folks,
it's the only thing they understand.

247
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:45,646
So you travel around on your bike
all the time, and help people?

248
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:54,582
Yep. I tend to move around a lot,
and things just happen along the way.

249
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:58,420
- Doesn't it get lonely?
- Nope.

250
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,066
You know, you remind me so much of JJ.

251
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:06,125
- He was always helping people out.
- Yeah. And look what happened to him.

252
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,000
- Junior.
- Soon as I'm 18, I'm getting out of here.

253
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:13,337
There's no way I'm going to end up like him.

254
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:17,938
It's a real shame that in today's day and age,
we couldn't find the evil that took him.

255
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:25,647
My grandfather was born a free Indian,
before the reservations, before the Civil War,

256
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:31,387
before the railway, even.
Now they're poisoning our youth.

257
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:37,958
And for what? The white man's evil.
Alcohol, drugs and money.

258
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:42,499
Greed is the evil that killed my son.

259
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:47,303
He was a good warrior for our people,
and a great son.

260
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:58,153
Kiowa, honey? Why don't you
take our guest outside for some fresh air?

261
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,258
We can have dessert later.

262
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,372
And you, where's your family?

263
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:27,377
Well, my family is my friends and my faith.

264
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:32,122
Oh, and my bike.

265
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:39,528
Well, you have friends here, now.
So I guess that makes us family, huh?

266
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,631
It looks like it.

267
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,406
I know what you mean, though.

268
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:56,502
It's like you're searching for something
or someone you can never find.

269
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:03,347
You have a few years to figure it all out.

270
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:06,890
But sometimes the answer
is closer than you think.

271
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,261
Well, I never knew my father, you know.

272
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,763
JJ always took care of me,
like the father I never had.

273
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,505
I just miss him a lot.

274
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,949
It's just so unfair.

275
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:35,343
He's like here one day
and then gone the next.

276
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,452
I just don't understand it.

277
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:46,189
Sometimes things are better left alone,
not understood.

278
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:51,364
That's easy for you to say.
You just beat up anyone you want.

279
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,132
Don't you have a girlfriend?

280
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,445
White Deer is a wise old man.

281
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:11,219
- He's seen many things in his lifetime.
- Yeah, he likes you.

282
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:15,787
- You want to go say good night to him?
- Yeah, all right.

283
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:52,014
<i>Put your weapons on the ground.</i>
<i>Put them on the ground! Now!</i>

284
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,792
<i>Nobody moves, nobody gets shot.</i>

285
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,384
<i>It's that simple.</i>

286
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:04,328
<i>Alex, jump down there and grab those bags.</i>

287
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,229
<i>Put them on the boat, one at a time.</i>

288
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,740
<i>Hurry! Let's go! Let's go!</i>

289
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:17,336
<i>Put it all on the boat, every single</i>
<i>one of them. Don't miss anything.</i>

290
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,647
<i>That's it.</i>

291
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,563
<i>Hold your fire, God damn it!</i>

292
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,026
Boss, one's getting away!

293
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,897
Well, what are you looking at? Go get him!

294
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,004
Bullseye Bill.

295
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,333
Son of a bitch!

296
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:05,092
- Where's he now?
- On the way. Leave it.

297
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:11,459
- Where the hell is he?
- I think we lost him.

298
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,101
- The boss is going to kick our ass.
- Shut up.

299
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,939
What is this?

300
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:20,937
<i>All right, that's enough.</i>

301
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:24,707
<i>Come on back to the boat.</i>
<i>Come get back here, and get on board.</i>

302
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,476
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

303
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:16,262
- I want to know who the runaway was.
- Sure thing, boss.

304
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:20,167
And who the hell is he?
And who else knows about the deal?

305
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:24,368
- Got some good news for you.
- That'd be a relief.

306
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:25,998
We found this.

307
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,477
It's pretty. What the hell is it?

308
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,979
Billy.
The Indian kid that owes us two grand.

309
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,710
Oh yeah, Billy.

310
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:40,221
Murph, I want you to take some guys
and find that runaway piece of shit,

311
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:43,224
and I want him dead. Understand?

312
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,352
You got it, boss.
I know just where to look for him.

313
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,623
Good.

314
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:25,863
Big night in Black River. It's Saturday night.
You mind if I join you?

315
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:30,603
- Go ahead. Have a seat.
- Let's do a shot first.

316
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:54,362
I've had this hotel for eight years now.
I used to hate the big city.

317
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:59,128
Now I kind of miss it.
Just trying to save enough money,

318
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:03,036
find me a good man
and get the hell out of here.

319
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:12,542
Thinking of you.

320
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:18,817
Go have a drink, have fun.
Did I buy you that outfit?

321
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:25,250
You can never spend too much
on a good-looking woman.

322
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,490
Right.

323
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:31,158
So what are we playing here, chief?
A little eight ball?

324
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:32,929
Stripes or solids?

325
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,732
No more killing.

326
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:41,436
- I cannot be involved in this anymore.
- Excuse me.

327
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:47,941
We got to be more careful.
Your methods, they're crude.

328
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:52,613
- They attract way too much attention.
- My methods, huh?

329
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:55,752
Why don't you just worry
about your end of the deal?

330
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:58,020
Let me worry about mine, okay?

331
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:01,527
Damn, I need some more limes.
I'll be right back.

332
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:10,231
Hey, little lady. Why don't you just put
that pretty little ass of yours

333
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,399
- down in this chair?
- And why don't you just have a seat?

334
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,842
- I've got to go to the kitchen.
- Better than that, how about in my lap?

335
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:19,279
- Now, come on.
- Excuse me, miss. Hold this.

336
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:25,386
- So, gentlemen, is there a problem?
- Yeah, you.

337
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:37,530
Bottom line, you know it and I know it,
is if I don't deliver this...

338
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,898
This casino to the boys up north
on a silver platter,

339
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,402
they're going to be pissed off.

340
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,939
And no matter what happens,
they're going to want their money.

341
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:45,541
You understand?

342
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,610
- Yeah, yeah.
- Corner pocket.

343
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:51,545
Yeah, I thought we had the Council with us
on that thing.

344
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:53,809
That casino deal,
that should have been ours.

345
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,749
Well, then why does JJ's family
control the project?

346
00:45:56,854 --> 00:46:00,051
Did you or did you not tell me
if I got JJ out of the way,

347
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,091
the Tribal Council would be forced
to give us the project?

348
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,955
- Isn't that what you told me?
- Yeah, that's what I said.

349
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,255
All right. I hear what you're saying.

350
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:09,594
- Just let me see what I can do on it.
- Too late for that.

351
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,725
You see, now, I got to wipe out
the whole fucking family,

352
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,427
just to make my point.

353
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:16,165
That's what I'm talking about,
your methods, man.

354
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:21,107
Yeah. They're effective, every time.
Side pocket.

355
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:25,642
Thanks for coming.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it or not.

356
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,844
I want to show you something.

357
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,782
Look who decided to show up.

358
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:36,656
- Oh, good. Perfect timing.
- Hi, Dad.

359
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:47,031
So today, we have a very special guest,
and he's going to talk to us about the Bible.

360
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:50,140
So I want you to say a very friendly hello
to our family friend.

361
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,037
Hi.

362
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,111
All right. Do you know what this is?

363
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,045
The Bible.

364
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:05,346
I need these to see the words.

365
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:11,519
"Show me your ways, oh Lord.

366
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:17,498
"Teach me your paths.
Remember not the sins of my youth

367
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:23,733
"and my rebellious ways.
Good and upright is the Lord.

368
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,843
"Therefore, he instructs sinners in his ways.

369
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:33,873
"He guides the humble in what is right
and teaches them his way."

370
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:39,848
You see, the Bible, it's like a guidebook.

371
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:43,419
It helps us lead a good, honest life.

372
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,321
Mom, come down here! Hurry!

373
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,705
Oh, man, I didn't... I didn't mean to...

374
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:08,848
- I didn't know where else to go.
- Let's get him to the house.

375
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,254
You're lucky to be alive.
We got to get him to a clinic.

376
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,294
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait a second.

377
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:24,926
Hold this.

378
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,065
Let's go, kids.

379
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:36,970
Go!

380
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,813
I knew about this drug deal going on,
down... Down by the river.

381
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:53,292
I was just hoping I could
make a score, you know?

382
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:58,092
But I didn't know Reno
was going to be there.

383
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:01,068
And I sure as shit didn't know
he was going to be killing everybody.

384
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:02,297
Shit.

385
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:08,104
Reno's guys, they were chasing me
through the woods, man.

386
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,744
My necklace! I lost my necklace! Fuck!

387
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:31,323
- Shit! Oh, fuck, it is them!
- Stay inside no matter what happens.

388
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,361
This is serious business, mister.

389
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,026
We don't want any trouble from you.

390
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,730
We're looking for an Indian, Billy.

391
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:14,568
He was shot, and we heard
he was around here somewhere.

392
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,044
He stole something from us.
We need to find him.

393
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:26,812
Go ahead and call the Sheriff.
You can use the phone inside.

394
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:36,397
No can do, mister. But you know that.

395
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,699
No, this is our problem, and

396
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:45,868
we're gonna deal with it ourselves,
the old-fashioned way.

397
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:51,509
Well, I'm sorry. Can't help you boys.

398
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:58,744
Well, it looks like we might have ourselves
a little problem here, now, don't we?

399
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:06,125
It was the kids that told us where the
bleeding Indian was by the old campground.

400
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,858
You should have seen
those little runts shitting themselves.

401
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:20,599
When I got a job to do,
nobody better stand in my way.

402
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:27,640
So you better back the fuck off
and move on, or else...

403
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,820
What you gonna do now, preacher man?

404
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:38,723
Well, I'm going to ask you
to beg the good Lord's forgiveness,

405
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:48,427
but not before I take this knee
and break that nose.

406
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,672
And you know what?

407
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,474
What?

408
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:04,148
There ain't nothing you can do about it.

409
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,756
Fuck you.

410
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,930
You don't know how to use that.

411
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,637
Well, that's one way of using it.

412
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,980
Okay! Okay! We get your point!
We get your point!

413
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,289
All right. Drop your pants.

414
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:48,660
- Wait a minute.
- Drop 'em!

415
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:52,201
Drop your pants. You, too. Go ahead!

416
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,338
Now, get out of here.

417
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,756
- Asshole!
- Fucker!

418
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,326
Be sure to take them someplace safe.

419
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:29,597
Don't worry.
Not even Reno knows of this place.

420
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:34,002
Our ancestors always spoke of a man
that would come from the north,

421
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:38,046
followed by the evil. Take care, my friend.

422
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,840
My prayers are with you.

423
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,412
This is it, isn't it?

424
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,751
I'm never going to see you again,
no matter what.

425
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,558
Sometimes it's better this way.

426
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,628
Let's go.

427
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,121
You got a choice to make.

428
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,058
We'll help you out.
But after you go to the doctor,

429
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:28,323
you have to testify against Reno.

430
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:32,834
Otherwise, you can go out there right now,
and deal with Reno yourself.

431
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:41,303
All right. Okay, fine. I'll do it.

432
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:47,116
Otherwise, I'm a dead man, right?

433
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:05,957
<i>We've got an assault and battery,</i>
<i>here, at Route 61.</i>

434
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,094
<i>Sending in backup.</i>

435
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:14,143
<i>Witness reports that Reno's men were seen</i>
<i>leaving the area, so keep an eye out. 10-4.</i>

436
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:49,742
Sheriff, we have Reno cold.
Billy was shot last night.

437
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,475
- You have what?
- You have to go and arrest him.

438
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:57,679
- He ain't exactly the best witness.
- Billy saw Reno commit murder.

439
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:19,338
Afternoon, folks.
You having a little pow-wow out here?

440
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:22,707
Hell, I wish I'd known,
I'd put an eagle feather in my hat.

441
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:27,408
- You got a van full of sick kids, Sheriff?
- What do you want, Reno?

442
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,178
Well, since you asked so kindly,

443
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,914
a couple of my men are thinking
about filing assault charges

444
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,286
against this one, here,
for beating the shit out of 'em.

445
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,451
I'm thinking about filing vandalism charges
for damage done to my vehicle

446
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:39,619
up on the Adobe Flats.

447
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:42,129
Hell, I've already talked to a judge.

448
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:45,928
Self-defense, as the Lord is my witness.

449
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:49,038
Well, let's talk about that, you and me.

450
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,801
Let's say we go have a drink at my bar
and talk things over.

451
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:56,901
- Sure, why not?
- Good. Follow me.

452
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,538
Y'all have a good afternoon.

453
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,942
Relax. Everybody relax.

454
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,685
I'm going to have a little talk
with my friend, here.

455
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:06,811
Have a little drink.

456
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:09,925
See if we can work something out.
Give me a beer.

457
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:13,428
And then give this man whatever he wants.

458
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:19,995
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- Tequila, straight up. No lime, no salt.

459
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:32,510
Look, here it is.

460
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,611
I don't give a fuck who you are
or where you came from.

461
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,483
I damn sure don't give a fuck
why you're here.

462
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,318
The way I see it, we got three options.

463
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:45,121
First is, I can just kill you now,
and be done with it.

464
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,162
The second, you can walk
out of this bar alive,

465
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,061
get on your iron horse, and ride out of town.

466
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,169
Never look back.
And when you're gone, you stay gone.

467
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,701
Third option, and for my money,
the most interesting, is

468
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,534
you could come to work for me.

469
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,335
Hell, I could use a man with your skills and
your... How did you put that, Gomez?

470
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:04,413
Your spiritual disposition.

471
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:09,348
Might even help my reputation.
What do you say?

472
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:23,494
First, your reputation is bad.
It's always going to be bad,

473
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,862
no matter who works for you.

474
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:31,840
Second, I don't like people that take
advantage of others for power and money.

475
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,265
And, third,

476
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,250
I don't like you, Reno.

477
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,584
Well, I'll take that as a "no."

478
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,453
Thanks for the drink.

479
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:55,121
- Don't walk away from me.
- Hold it.

480
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:33,166
Wait, wait, wait!
This holy man's day of reckoning is at hand.

481
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:41,674
Stop! I said stop, God damn it.
Nobody walks out on me.

482
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:44,746
Hold it! That's enough.

483
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:48,848
Now put your weapon down.

484
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:55,958
- Sheriff, what do you think you're doing?
- Put your gun down or I'll put you down.

485
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:11,470
Let's go find a little Indian boy to scalp.

486
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:14,475
Back in the bar. Move it.

487
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:34,128
Damn, that was stupid.

488
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:37,563
Now Reno's got me in his sights, too.

489
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,670
Yep.

490
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:45,867
I got to find your missing witness
before Reno does.

491
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:51,580
All right, Sheriff.

492
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:17,506
I knew you'd come back.

493
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,741
That's the gun they shot you with.

494
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,085
I got something else for you.

495
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:03,881
"All my enemies are driven back.
They shall fall and perish at thy presence."

496
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:30,737
Murphy, I'm not interrupting you, am I?

497
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:35,245
Did you make my call for me?

498
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:39,151
Yeah, yeah, I did, boss.
They'll be here tonight.

499
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:43,588
Well, good, good. That's grand.
It's about fucking time, too.

500
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:47,629
Should have done this a long time ago.
Sugar plum? Honey?

501
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,857
You don't mind if we
talk a little business, do you?

502
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:54,197
- All right.
- Move it!

503
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,699
So, what did my buddy up north
have to say?

504
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:21,060
Hurry!

505
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:10,603
Thanks for coming, partner.
Glad you're here.

506
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:14,872
The crew does look good.

507
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:20,616
I see you still got the twins with you,
and they are still riding their own material.

508
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:24,248
- Never leave home without them.
- Business going well, I take it?

509
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:27,851
- Everything going smooth up north?
- I got no problems here.

510
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:32,367
You know, the usual, some killing,
some fucking. Lots of hard partying.

511
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:36,029
- That's what pays off in this business.
- Every time.

512
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:29,520
My problem is, I got a witness.

513
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:33,288
He's just a local Indian boy named Billy,
but he saw one of my drug raids go down.

514
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:38,926
And just seeing it go down, it's no big
deal in and of itself, but this one got ugly.

515
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:42,366
It got messy in a hurry,
and somebody shot one of my men.

516
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:45,302
All hell broke loose, and everybody died.

517
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:52,838
You fucked up.
Killing dealers wasn't part of the plan.

518
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:54,506
Now, the Mexicans are
going to want payback,

519
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:57,141
and these Mexicans don't fuck around.

520
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,548
You took their money. You took their drugs.

521
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:01,179
You probably killed
somebody's fucking cousin.

522
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:03,292
What were you thinking?

523
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:16,138
- You still got the money and the drugs?
- Yeah, sure.

524
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,704
This is what we're going to do.

525
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:22,572
We're going to pin it on the Indian kid.

526
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:27,045
Put the money and the drugs on him.
Make sure the Sheriff finds him that way.

527
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:30,414
- Dead, with all the shit on him.
- That's a damn good idea.

528
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,350
- You think so, Reno?
- Yep.

529
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:40,518
I don't know, 'cause you still seem nervous.
Is there something you're not telling me?

530
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:50,167
A couple of days ago, this old boy comes
riding into town on a strange-looking bike.

531
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,870
He starts beating up my men,
shooting up my bar,

532
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:58,003
causing me all kinds of trouble
every day of the week.

533
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:02,210
Big, tall, rough-looking bastard.
Military training for sure.

534
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,045
And here's the weird thing.

535
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:09,182
He carries a Bible around with him
everywhere he goes.

536
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:14,729
Did you say he had a Bible?

537
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,593
How do you know it wasn't just a big book?

538
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:20,930
No, it was a Bible for sure.
My men even tell me he reads from it.

539
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:29,374
- Is it a tall guy, blonde hair, old Hog?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's him exactly!

540
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:38,143
Lmpossible, I knew a guy like that once,
but that guy's dead.

541
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:39,413
He's dead?

542
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:44,755
Well, you fucked up, because
he's alive, and he's kicking my ass.

543
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:50,093
I fucked up? Huh? I fucked up?

544
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:55,798
No, 'cause the way I see it, Reno, the only
one that's fucking up around here is you.

545
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:58,600
Drug dealers are dead. Business is dead.

546
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,403
You got a murder witness
running around free that should be dead.

547
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:05,469
And to top it all off,
we still don't have a fucking casino!

548
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:19,193
You got a nice place here, Reno.

549
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:23,458
I hope you don't mind if I live here
when you're dead.

550
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:31,439
Come on. Let's go, you pieces
of white trash. Going to Black River.

551
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:21,087
- I wonder if my kids are okay.
- They're in good hands.

552
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:24,453
White Deer is a wise old man.

553
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:29,226
You remind me of their father.

554
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:34,431
Every day I see their faces
and I think of him, and remember him

555
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,001
and how much they miss him.

556
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:44,344
- Really?
- He was killed by a biker gang.

557
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:52,852
Look, maybe something good
will come out of what I have to do here.

558
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:57,857
Just remember to make the most of it.

559
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:06,433
Can't you wait till morning? Please don't go.

560
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,490
It's a nightmare.

561
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,983
You must be Billy.

562
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:09,759
Nobody else could be stupid enough
to sit on my bike.

563
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,025
Yeah, I'm Billy.

564
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:13,999
Who the fuck are you?

565
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:31,682
- My name is Jarfe.
- That's a funny name. Jarfe.

566
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:36,224
You know, there's a funny story
that goes with that.

567
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:38,917
Well, my mother and father,
they were really bad drunks.

568
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:42,258
And the last thing she gave me
before she died giving birth to me

569
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:44,298
was this fucked-up name.

570
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:48,796
Now, long story short,
she's at the hospital, on a table,

571
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:51,602
legs up in the stirrups,
and I come popping out.

572
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,766
The nurse turns to her and says,
"What do you want to name him?"

573
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:56,741
Now, she meant to say "Jeff."

574
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:01,472
But she was just so drunk and beaten,
you know, the old man busted her jaw,

575
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,482
that it came out "Jarfe."

576
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:08,656
And then she died a few minutes later.

577
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,720
So, I guess you could say I came into
this world a little fucked up, huh?

578
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:19,833
Yeah.

579
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:22,630
All right, I want you to have this, right here.

580
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:26,730
I don't do drugs, Billy, they're bad for you.

581
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:40,654
Man, please.

582
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:43,451
If this is about the other night, please, man.

583
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:47,359
I promise I won't tell nobody.
I won't tell nobody, please.

584
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:50,860
Let me talk to Reno.
I talk to Reno, please, man.

585
01:12:56,205 --> 01:13:00,301
You redskin fucks'll never learn.
This is a white man's world.

586
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:22,724
Not so fast.
You got an old biker staying here.

587
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:30,737
- Tall guy, blonde? Reads the Bible.
- Screw you.

588
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:35,572
That's the idea.
Listen, you dirty, little whore.

589
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:38,144
Maybe you'd like to have this
conversation in private.

590
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:41,546
- I'm not a whore.
- That's what they all say.

591
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:46,182
Hey, what's going on?

592
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:17,877
Hey, up against the wall, asshole.

593
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:22,016
- Is there a problem, officer?
- I said up against the wall!

594
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:53,248
I'm sorry, did you say something?

595
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:29,682
- Kiowa, come back here! Come back.
- No, I'm going to help him.

596
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:58,411
There he is!

597
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:15,928
Where do you think you're going?

598
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:19,200
- Billy's, uh...
- Yeah, I know.

599
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:22,759
- Dead.
- So are my two deputies.

600
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:25,270
And you're not going in there.

601
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:30,936
All right, Sheriff.

602
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:37,115
But under the circumstances,
I'll make an exception.

603
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:56,964
They're on the other side of town,

604
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:59,903
- by the bank.
- Thank you, Dan.

605
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:03,537
Put your tampon back in
and go let them know.

606
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:05,442
All right, let's go.

607
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,205
Come on.

608
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:23,256
He's coming! He's coming!

609
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:46,717
Hey man, over there.

610
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:59,033
You, go that way. You, go that way.

611
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:11,744
Not even God himself can save the
holy man of this piece-of-shit town from me.

612
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,849
I'll burn this fucking place to the ground.

613
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:41,448
Can't anybody kill this fucking guy? Go!

614
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:55,429
You gonna just sit there? Let's go.

615
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:54,149
Freeze! Nobody move!

616
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:04,661
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to find good help?

617
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:08,167
Your holy man ought to be dead,
and so should you.

618
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:12,398
I said, don't move.

619
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:41,899
Come on.

620
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,485
What you got?

621
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:02,055
They're all dead.

622
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,648
- All of them?
- Well, they look dead to me.

623
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:07,124
If not dead, really fucked up.

624
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:11,158
It's impossible. 
It can't be you.

625
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:16,560
It's me.

626
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:43,823
It's all there. 
The drugs and the money.

627
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:56,261
Your cousin judge
ain't going to help you now.

628
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:58,594
Fine.
