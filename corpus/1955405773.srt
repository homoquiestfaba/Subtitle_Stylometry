1
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,516
Ticket, please.

2
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,418
Just one, please.

3
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,186
Two, please.

4
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,454
Cashier: Enjoy the show.

5
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:57,289
Yes, sir?

6
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:59,058
One adult.

7
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,606
<i> Strong, silent, sensibly new.</i>

8
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:19,178
<i> The 1960 impala convertible</i>
<i> by Chevrolet.</i>

9
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:20,412
Hey, Tony.

10
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,348
Evening, Mr. kimmel. Have you
met my girlfriend? She's a...

11
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,653
<i> Greater leg room.</i>

12
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:32,191
<i> Roomy reasons why Chevrolet is</i>
<i> first in the value that lasts.</i>

13
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,636
<i> Across the usa,</i>

14
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,539
<i> Chevrolet is the way</i>
<i> to start the sixties right.</i>

15
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,274
Man:
<i> ...Saratoga Springs,</i>

16
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,575
<i> the body of a woman was found</i>

17
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,143
<i> brutally stabbed</i>
<i> just yards away</i>

18
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,845
<i> from Harry's rainbow grill,</i>

19
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,346
<i>one of the bus's regular stops.</i>

20
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,216
<i> The husband has put out a plea</i>
<i> to anyone who saw anything,</i>

21
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,384
<i> to come forward.</i>

22
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:08,220
Man: <i> Now boarding green</i>
<i> line bus to saratoga Springs</i>

23
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,088
<i> at gate 5.</i>

24
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,495
Walter: Clara!

25
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:19,831
Honestly. Why do you always
insist on seeing me off

26
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,266
if you're going to be late?

27
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,369
So you heard,
my mother is dying, again.

28
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,704
I have some good news.

29
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,539
Well, I think it's good news.

30
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,908
My story's
in this month's issue!

31
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,477
That's the good news?

32
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,013
Why don't you focus
on your real job?

33
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,381
Wait till you read it.

34
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,849
I will wait.
I have to work.

35
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,786
I have all the paperwork on
the sale of the Carter house.

36
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,654
People are boarding.

37
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,264
I wish I could drive you.

38
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,901
We could stop on the way
just like old times.

39
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,838
I like the bus.
Gives me time to think.

40
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,742
Walter: Well, could you
think about our party, please?

41
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,344
I suppose I have to.

42
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,714
- But don't invite Jon.
- You know Jon has to be there.

43
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,983
If we don't ask, he won't
come again, just like Jack.

44
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,517
And what a loss he's been.

45
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,454
Let's not quarrel, honey. Okay?

46
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,359
Walter: See you in a few days!
We'll make it a hell of a party!

47
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,427
Send my regards to your mother.

48
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,629
Thank you.

49
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,210
Sorry, folks!

50
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:41,813
Our first rest stop is gonna be
a bit further on up the highway.

51
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,615
Harry's rainbow grill is closed.

52
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,717
Some sort of
police investigation.

53
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,319
Nothing we can do.

54
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,335
Lady: Take care.

55
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,905
It was a good turnout
for Mrs. kimmel.

56
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,940
Yeah. Thanks, Tony. She was...

57
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,043
She was really loved.

58
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,158
Any more news, detective corby?

59
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,760
No, nothing new.

60
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:42,260
But I never give up.

61
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,264
You can tell that to Mr. kimmel.
Should be comforting.

62
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,999
I'll be sure to tell him, sir.

63
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,569
- Mourner: I'm so sorry.
- Thank you very much.

64
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,605
- Mourner: I'm so sorry.
- That's very kind. Thank you.

65
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,255
Clara: God, I hope they don't
drag snow into the house.

66
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,357
What are you talking about?

67
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,458
They're walking up the path.

68
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,161
None of the women want to
ruin their shoes. Lighten up.

69
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,796
Come on, kids.

70
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,265
Oh, bill!

71
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,567
Betty.

72
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,970
- Great to see you.
- Hi Betty.

73
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,873
Can you believe it?
The Stackhouse's entertain.

74
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:38,984
Okay.

75
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,054
Thank you very much,
Walter. And I must say,

76
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,957
your wife is the
most wonderful person.

77
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,560
There's not a house
she can't buy or sell.

78
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,395
You're gonna be able
to quit work soon.

79
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,866
Taking on her pretty face was
the smartest thing I ever did.

80
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,802
Sorry, I have to go,

81
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,037
do my duty.

82
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,740
Martha.

83
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,009
So glad you could make it.

84
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,212
I hope you don't mind that i
brought my friend Ellie along.

85
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,580
She was having a dull day.

86
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,715
I'm sorry I can't
promise fireworks.

87
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,050
But we'll do our best.

88
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,352
Man: Martha!

89
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,687
Excuse me.

90
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,761
So this is the good life?

91
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,763
Yeah.

92
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,067
- Let me get you a drink.
- Any chance of a beer?

93
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,436
A beer?
I think we got one of those.

94
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,737
Don't move an inch.

95
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,259
Martha gave me
the story you wrote.

96
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,894
I loved it.

97
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,330
Ah well. They've taken another.

98
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,098
That's really cool.

99
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,436
Here I was, thinking
you were just a...

100
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:05,870
Straight up architect.

101
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,039
Oh no.
Nothing straight up about me.

102
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,044
Well, what do you do? Or...

103
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,779
Maybe I should try and guess.

104
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,582
- I might take offense.
- No, I want to guess.

105
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,917
Indulge me.

106
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:20,685
Musician...

107
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:24,656
Of some sort. You write poetry.
You live in the village.

108
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,791
Two out of three,
that's not bad.

109
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,293
I don't write poetry.

110
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,596
- Jon: There you are.
- Uh.

111
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,331
This is Jon caar.
We work together.

112
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,401
Walter: Martha puts up with
both of us. Jon meet Ellie.

113
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,402
Ellie briess.

114
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,405
I meant to ask.
Can you get away on Sunday?

115
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,941
I don't know,

116
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:46,177
- Clara and I are supposed to--
- don't do it.

117
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,779
Same old story.

118
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,914
Give me a break, man. Okay?

119
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:57,088
They need food. And soon
before they start to fall over.

120
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,836
Who was that girl
Martha brought?

121
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,774
Walter: I don't know her name.

122
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,375
I do.

123
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,344
It's Ellie briess.

124
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:21,880
Who is she?

125
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,783
Walter: Oh, I don't know.

126
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,451
And I don't care.

127
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,923
Come on.

128
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,292
Come on, come on, come on.

129
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,161
You are a sex maniac.

130
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,930
You used to love my mania.

131
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,269
Come on, kits,
let's try to remember.

132
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,705
Why don't we start by

133
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,074
christening every room
in this house?

134
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,177
Please, Walter.

135
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,014
Not tonight.
Can't you just go to sleep?

136
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,021
Ah, god. When is it going
to fucking end, Clara?

137
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,223
Why are you so unhappy?

138
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,993
Hm? You promised me
you'd go see someone.

139
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,064
I just don't wanna see anyone.

140
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:18,069
And it's not my fault. Can't you
just-- just leave me alone.

141
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,625
Kimmel: I told you, detective.

142
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,929
I don't know anyone who would
have wanted to kill Helen.

143
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,899
I appreciate you coming around,
but I need time.

144
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,002
Time to grieve.

145
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,406
Yes.

146
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,908
I understand.

147
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,445
I'll find
your wife's killer, Mr. kimmel.

148
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,647
I want you to be
reassured by that.

149
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,050
There's no one smarter than me.

150
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,854
"Nobody holds
a good opinion of a

151
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,256
man who holds
a low opinion of himself."

152
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,625
Mark twain.

153
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,695
Same century, mister...

154
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,898
Corby, but it was
in fact, Anthony trollope.

155
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,070
I'll sleep easier, detective,

156
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:35,340
knowing a man of your
intelligence is on the case.

157
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,320
I'll leave you to your
picnic, Mr. kimmel.

158
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,670
Clara: I have a job,
for god's sake.

159
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:08,973
I can't just drop everything
every time you get sick!

160
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,643
I can't take
much more of this, mother.

161
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:17,448
I have tried to tell you. And
you never listen. You never do!

162
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,386
I can't promise.

163
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,857
Walter has just got back.
I have to go.

164
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,259
I have to go. Goodbye.

165
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,530
Hi, kits. You all right?

166
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,999
Don't let her get to you.

167
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,406
How's the lovely, Ellie?

168
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,311
Why don't you spend the
rest of the evening with her?

169
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,618
That's right.

170
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,153
Go to her.

171
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,055
Get out.

172
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,123
Just go to her.

173
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,028
<i> A police chief</i>
<i> told the press today</i>

174
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,297
<i> they are still looking</i>
<i>for clues to the brutal killing</i>

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,103
Corby.

179
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,741
The Helen kimmel murder.

180
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,443
It's building nicely.

181
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,944
I can taste it.

182
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,880
Kimmel has a strong alibi.

183
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,182
We've already turned him over.
There's nothing there.

184
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,986
That kid Tony ricco
swears kimmel was at the movies.

185
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,387
He's in the clear.

186
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,300
Hi there, Mr. kimmel.
How's it going?

187
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,734
It's going okay, thanks.

188
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,337
That detective's
been here again.

189
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,839
He keeps asking me
the same questions.

190
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,975
Well, Tony, you just keep
giving him the same answer.

191
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,377
I got you
a special treat today.

192
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,615
You're spoiling me, Mr. k.

193
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,784
It's all a question
of who you know...

194
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,120
And who you trust.

195
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,822
Hash browns with lots of onions.

196
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,925
- And one of your frankfurters.
- You got it.

197
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,661
And give me
some cheese with that.

198
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,230
Sure thing Mr. k.

199
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,434
And a big slice of that
chocolate banana cake.

200
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,042
Walter:
...Still going on about this.

201
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,745
Clara: I saw you.
Everyone saw you.

202
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,547
Are you
out of your fucking...

203
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,415
- Mind.
- Ellie briess. Ellie briess.

204
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,817
Clara: Don't dare deny it.

205
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,418
Walter: It's not worth denying.

206
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,156
I have-- I have really tried.

207
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,525
But you are making it
impossible for me.

208
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,494
What the hell
happened to us? Did we...

209
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,662
We had one good year.

210
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,632
Was that it? Was that
all we got? One good year?

211
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:28,766
Well? Was that it?

212
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,302
Stop it! Stop shouting at me.

213
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,739
Good night, Claudia.

214
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,479
You married me
"in sickness and in health."

215
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:44,515
- Remember?
- Whatever happened to "health"?

216
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,489
It's not my fault!
I can't help it.

217
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,329
I promise. I promise. This
time I will go and see someone.

218
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,500
I know I've said it so many
times, but believe me, Walter.

219
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,936
- I will go and see someone.
- Calm down.

220
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,678
- I promise I will.
- Sure. Go right ahead.

221
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,465
For god's sakes, Clara,
don't being so melodramatic.

222
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,870
Leave me alone!

223
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,444
All right.

224
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,714
- All right. I will.

225
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:50,848
You're on your own!

226
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,451
House is all yours tonight.

227
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,460
Are you following this story?

228
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,428
Not closely.

229
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,366
I'd say he looks like
a man who murdered his wife.

230
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:09,634
That's ridiculous.

231
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,869
You can't tell that
just by looking at someone.

232
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,338
Well, I'd say he did it.

233
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,773
I've worked it out.

234
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,643
He followed her bus,

235
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,911
lured her away from the stop,

236
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,514
killed her.

237
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,552
Simple as that.
Turned around and headed home.

238
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:30,988
Left no clues.

239
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,291
Seems he has a great alibi.

240
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:35,926
He's real smart.

241
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,371
Clara!

242
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:53,644
Clara!

243
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,623
Clara!

244
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,059
Oh, for god's sake.
Open the door. Clara!

245
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:18,736
Oh god no, no, no!
Clara! Clara!

246
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,604
Clara!

247
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,578
Clara. Come on, Clara.

248
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,385
Clara, wake up.

249
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,089
Doctor:<i> We'll pump her out.</i>

250
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,625
We should know in 48 hours.

251
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:54,772
Walter?

252
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,041
Who was she seeing?

253
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,709
What?

254
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,578
Her analyst, what's his name?

255
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,448
I'm sorry.

256
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,852
I couldn't persuade her
to see anyone.

257
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,920
I tried.

258
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,392
You should have tried harder.

259
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,997
Woman: <i> Dr. Palmer,</i>
<i> please dial the operator.</i>

260
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,600
<i> Dr. Palmer,</i>
<i> please dial the operator.</i>

261
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,171
She took every god damn
pill in the house.

262
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,908
I knew she was going to.
We'd had another fight.

263
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,512
I stood my ground this time.

264
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,949
I told her. I've fucking had it.
I didn't sign up for this.

265
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,558
But at that moment I think
i really wanted her to.

266
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,693
No, Walter,

267
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,163
you're not thinking straight.

268
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,023
Hi there.

269
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,724
Remember me?

270
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,627
Sure. Of course. Hi.

271
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,563
Good to see you again. Come in.

272
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,633
Some orchids. Lots of them.

273
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,404
To thank Mrs. Stackhouse
for the party.

274
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,006
She'll love them. Thanks.

275
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,075
So, what brings you up here?

276
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:42,012
Oh, you know, I like to get
out of the city on the weekend

277
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,848
and just drive.

278
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:48,018
Me and my car found ourselves
driving north, so...

279
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,488
Here I am.

280
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,490
So your wife is at work?

281
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:56,193
I remember you saying
that she worked on Saturdays.

282
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,997
Yeah, it's her busiest day.

283
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,200
She sells houses.
And I build them.

284
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,546
So this is your design?

285
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,648
How long have you lived here?

286
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,086
We move in a year
after we got married.

287
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:23,954
Yeah.

288
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,656
How long ago was that?

289
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,726
Four year ago now.

290
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:30,661
Yeah.

291
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,030
Kids?

292
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,733
No. Not yet.

293
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,372
I'm moving soon.

294
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:42,339
Oh?

295
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,008
Still the village,

296
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,342
but a...

297
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,244
Little place of my own.

298
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:48,846
Time to grow up.

299
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,049
It's not all
it's cracked up to be.

300
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:55,719
No, honestly.
I need to slow down.

301
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,456
Packed a hell of a lot
in these past five years.

302
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,859
- You're making me jealous.

303
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,794
Oh no. I'm not so sure.

304
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,298
Grass is always greener.

305
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,402
Well...

306
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,937
I'd better get going.

307
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,206
What'll you be doing tonight?

308
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,174
Singing...

309
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,778
At a little club
off macdougal...

310
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,079
Called "Molly's."

311
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,648
You should come along sometime.

312
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,850
I'm there almost every night.

313
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,752
Maybe one day I will.

314
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:34,925
It was nice to see you.

315
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,226
You too.

316
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,411
I'll take a rye.

317
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,448
Rye. Double. Neat.

318
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,431
Don't ever leave me.

319
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:41,839
Promise?

320
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,796
Who did you tell?

321
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,297
Don't worry.

322
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,334
Everyone thinks
you had a bad flu.

323
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:12,636
Kind of a pneumonia.

324
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,040
Thank you.

325
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,346
I knew
it's what you'd want, kits.

326
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,154
The orchids downstairs,
who brought them?

327
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,856
Was it Betty?

328
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:38,829
I completely forgot. Martha's
friend, Ellie, brought them.

329
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:40,364
To thank you for the party.

330
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:47,504
- How long did she stay?
- I don't know. Not very long.

331
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,241
Long enough to fuck her?

332
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,177
Oh, Clara.

333
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,380
I was right, wasn't I?

334
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,749
- Admit it.
- I can't--

335
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,484
I can't have this
conversation right now.

336
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,053
I'm going out.

337
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,421
I will be back.

338
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,156
I promise.

339
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:07,724
But this can't go on.

340
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,660
This has to end.

341
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:10,013
Kimmel: Are you looking
for anything in particular?

342
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,784
Yeah. I'm looking for a book
called "the living city"

343
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:15,252
by frank Lloyd Wright.

344
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,854
You happen to have it in stock?

345
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,489
Kimmel: I'm sure I don't.

346
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,176
As I thought, I don't have it.

347
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,945
I do have a copy
of Lloyd Wright's

348
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,647
"disappearing city."

349
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:45,816
I've got that.

350
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,454
In fact,
i have a 1932 first edition.

351
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,757
I could try to find it.

352
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,563
Do you want me
to order it for you?

353
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,799
Uh, yes. I would, thanks.

354
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,279
Just fill in
your name and address.

355
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,161
Do you own this bookstore?

356
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,364
Yes.

357
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,539
What is it to you?

358
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:48,411
I heard your wife died recently.

359
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,415
She was murdered.

360
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,785
Sorry.

361
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,888
Have they found her killer?

362
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:00,690
No.

363
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,297
Well...

364
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,567
I hope they find
the man who's guilty.

365
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,536
So do I.

366
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,639
Thank you for your concern.

367
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,710
I'll be in touch
if I find that book.

368
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,006
You shouldn't
be up this late.

369
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,244
Neither should you.

370
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,849
No doubt you had a couple
of scotches with Jon?

371
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:39,256
Yeah. That's exactly what I did.
We needed to let off some steam.

372
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,226
Where did you go?

373
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,429
Some dive.
I don't remember the name.

374
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,370
I followed you from the office.

375
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,505
I saw you.

376
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,008
With your whore.

377
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,777
Ellie briess.

378
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,991
- I knew all along.
- No. You didn't.

379
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,793
There's nothing to know.

380
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:23,066
Don't think there's a future
in it because there isn't.

381
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,819
I'm going to divorce you, Clara.

382
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,927
I'm calling our lawyers.

383
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:52,996
Do what you want.

384
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,864
It's your life.

385
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,959
If you divorce me,

386
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,695
then I will kill myself.

387
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,633
And everyone will know
it's your fault.

388
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,705
And everyone
will blame you, Walter.

389
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,445
There will be blood
on your hands.

390
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,046
Mr. Stackhouse.

391
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,715
I thought you were
with Mrs. Stackhouse

392
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,917
seeing her off
at the bus station.

393
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,019
What are you talking about?

394
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,054
A telegram.

395
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:26,956
Her mother.

396
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,392
It seemed
very serious this time.

397
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,630
She was aiming to catch
the 6.30 up to saratoga.

398
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,644
Man: Watch it, mister.

399
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,314
Clara!

400
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:53,683
Why didn't you
tell me you're going away?

401
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:55,919
Why should I make it
easier for you?

402
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,656
It seems my mother
is really dying this time.

403
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:03,193
So, you get to spend another
48 hours with Ellie briess.

404
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:06,963
Think that will make you happy?

405
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,234
You don't look at all happy.

406
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:06,249
Excuse me. How much time
do we have at this stop?

407
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,817
Fifteen minutes.

408
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,586
So they say.

409
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,776
Oh, Mr. Stackhouse.

410
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,979
I just received
a call from the hospital.

411
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,149
To say that
Mrs. Stackhouse's mother

412
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,051
died during the night.

413
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,953
Oh, god.

414
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:19,856
Oh, no.

415
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:24,160
Thanks Claudia. I'll call
Mrs. Stackhouse back right away.

416
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,962
But she isn't there.

417
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,398
She never arrived.

418
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,334
- No. That's impossible.
- Oh, dear.

419
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,903
Do you have the number of?
Who did you speak to?

420
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:36,839
- You sure you got this right?
- I didn't make a mistake.

421
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,408
I swear.

422
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:44,714
Stackhouse residence.

423
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:46,182
<i> Is this Walter Stackhouse?</i>

424
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:46,983
Yes.

425
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:48,685
<i> My name is detective Miller,</i>

426
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,520
<i> saratoga Springs</i>
<i> police department.</i>

427
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,756
<i> I'm afraid we have something</i>
<i> we need to talk to you about.</i>

428
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,769
You okay, Mr. Stackhouse?

429
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:13,903
Yeah.

430
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:17,240
I'm afraid I still need to go
through a few things with you.

431
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:18,875
Can you do this now?

432
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,444
Sure.

433
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,079
I think so.

434
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,081
I'll be fine.

435
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,458
Walter:
What do you think happened?

436
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:40,663
We're not sure, sir. She may
have taken her own life, she--

437
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:42,331
corby: She may
have been pushed, of course.

438
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,901
How do you do? I'm detective
Lawrence corby, homicide.

439
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:46,636
Uh, Walter Stackhouse.

440
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,471
I'm so sorry for your loss.

441
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,341
I'll take over this now.
Just leave your notes.

442
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,485
When was the last time
you saw your wife?

443
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,555
Yesterday, at home.

444
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,658
But I spoke to her
on the phone...

445
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,594
From my office
before she caught the bus.

446
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:15,531
Do you have reason to believe
your wife would commit suicide?

447
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,536
Well, she's tried before,
I'm afraid to say.

448
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:25,041
But I just can't imagine
Clara would jump off a bridge.

449
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,077
Corby: Well.

450
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,612
I've seen the bridge.

451
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,615
It's not likely
that she slipped and fell.

452
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,685
Well, I hope someone's going
to make some investigations.

453
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,421
Don't worry, I will,
Mr. Stackhouse.

454
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:40,556
When you left work,

455
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:43,259
after speaking to your wife,
did you go straight home?

456
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:44,594
Yes.

457
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:48,030
Well, actually, no.

458
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,237
Actually, I was trying
to reach a friend.

459
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,939
I drove around for a while.

460
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,242
Did you ever reach your friend?

461
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:01,677
Yes.

462
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,546
I'll need his name and address.

463
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,050
Ellie briess,

464
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,353
38 Cornelia street,

465
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,054
it's in the village.

466
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,548
So, they have my name?

467
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,287
I hope they won't blame me.

468
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,223
No. She always
had mental problems.

469
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:49,191
- Neurotic, jealous.

470
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,934
Ellie: Oh, hi Martha.

471
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:00,970
Ah, Jesus.

472
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,206
No. How awful.

473
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,877
Poor Mr. Stackhouse.

474
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:11,047
Do-- do they know what happened?

475
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,319
Yeah.

476
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:18,321
Bye.

477
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,561
I didn't think I should
tell Martha you were here.

478
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:39,542
Good day, Mr. kimmel.

479
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:53,990
Kimmel: Stackhouse.

480
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,492
Walter Stackhouse.

481
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,594
Walter Stackhouse.

482
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,235
Walter Stackhouse.

483
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:10,506
I'm not open today. I'm sorry.

484
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:11,440
It's me.

485
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,143
Detective corby.

486
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,312
I think we need to talk.

487
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,482
Did you read a story
in today's local paper

488
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,751
about a woman who
died at Harry's rainbow grill?

489
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:26,088
Yes, I did in fact.

490
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,557
A bit of a coincidence,
don't you think?

491
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,559
What are you saying?

492
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,262
Well...

493
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:34,563
Your wife...

494
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,132
And now some other...

495
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,867
Poor man's wife.

496
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,568
What was his name?

497
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,970
I have no idea.

498
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:42,938
The paper said it
was a suicide most--

499
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,541
the husband's name
was Stackhouse.

500
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,477
Walter Stackhouse.

501
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,449
He's under investigation.

502
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,718
Just like you are, Mr. kimmel.

503
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:01,557
Statistics tend to make me
suspicious of husbands.

504
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,127
And I love statistics.

505
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,733
What specifically did you
want to ask me, detective?

506
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:12,701
You know.

507
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:16,405
I've been going over your
wife's case again and again.

508
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,642
Your movie alibi...

509
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,178
It bothers me.

510
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,783
Anthony has given his statement.

511
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,853
Anthony ricco...

512
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,290
Seventeen...

513
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:35,658
Young...

514
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:39,361
I'm talking to him regularly.

515
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:43,065
All your colleagues know
me very well, detective.

516
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,502
So I believe, and I wanna
get to know you better myself.

517
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,305
You know.
We've got a lot in common.

518
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,674
My family comes from Newark.

519
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,744
We can't let your wife's killer
get away with it, can we?

520
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,722
I'll be in touch again soon.

521
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,193
Thank you for your time,
Mr. kimmel.

522
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:32,848
<i> Hello?</i>

523
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,250
Tony?

524
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:38,154
You wanna come over
for some beers this evening?

525
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,242
Walter: It was her choice.

526
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:35,811
Wasn't it?

527
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,947
Of course it was.

528
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:42,017
You can't blame yourself.
I mean, you tried everything.

529
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,786
Did I? Did I really?

530
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,190
What's the difference
between wishing someone dead

531
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:50,459
and actually
doing something about it?

532
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:53,729
One hell of a difference.

533
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:57,833
- What are you talking about?
- No, uh...

534
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,237
I don't know.

535
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,640
I honestly don't know anymore.

536
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:57,459
Morning, Claudia.

537
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:00,696
I'm sorry.

538
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,731
I don't want to
work here anymore,

539
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:03,832
Mr. Stackhouse.

540
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,501
I've come
to collect a few things.

541
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:07,536
There's no reason
for you to leave.

542
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,041
Okay.

543
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,309
I understand.

544
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:16,545
If that's the way
you prefer to handle things.

545
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,348
I don't want anything.

546
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,851
I'm sorry, Mr. Stackhouse.

547
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,486
Truly.

548
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:50,479
Corby: Mr. Stackhouse,

549
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:51,680
please have a seat.

550
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,423
This is Mr. de vries.

551
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,629
Have you ever met
Mr. de vries before?

552
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,732
I don't think so. No.

553
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,800
Well?

554
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,569
Yeah. That's him.

555
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,605
I never forget a face.

556
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,340
That's him.

557
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:21,110
- Everyone I know always says--
- corby: That's fine.

558
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,079
Thank you, Mr. de vries.
You can go now.

559
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:30,486
So.

560
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:33,989
Mr. de vries says he spoke
to you at Harry's rainbow grill.

561
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:37,192
You asked him
how long the bus stopped,

562
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:38,560
the night your wife died.

563
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,598
Yes, I was there.

564
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,768
I...

565
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:47,836
Followed the bus.

566
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:49,872
I wanted to talk to Clara.

567
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:52,541
And did you?

568
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:55,177
No. I couldn't find her.
I looked everywhere.

569
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,517
Why didn't you tell us this?

570
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:04,953
Thought she got off
at one of the other stops

571
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:05,921
on the way.

572
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,623
Had some other plan.

573
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:11,126
So, your story about
driving around, was--

574
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:13,162
yes. It was very stupid of me.

575
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:15,197
I should have told you.

576
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,032
Well.

577
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,001
You better tell me now.

578
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:21,937
Exactly what did happen?
Cigarette?

579
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,077
Well.

580
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,479
I felt...

581
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,449
I felt we had to
finish something.

582
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:34,750
You'd been arguing?

583
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:37,653
No.

584
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,624
Just a question
of finishing something...

585
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,694
Important
that we were discussing.

586
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,130
Were you
and Mrs. Stackhouse happy?

587
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,770
Actually,
we were getting a divorce.

588
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,509
Did you both want this divorce?

589
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:02,444
In all honesty,
she didn't want a divorce,

590
00:58:02,446 --> 00:58:04,213
but she knew there was
nothing she could do

591
00:58:04,215 --> 00:58:06,648
- to stop me from getting one.
- Seems she tried.

592
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,984
I followed up on those
previous attempts that she made.

593
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,854
Can you prove suicide
in this sort of case?

594
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,691
Coming off a bridge that high,
with so many injuries,

595
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:16,925
it's hard to get a consensus.

596
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:19,628
But I just like to eliminate
all the other possibilities.

597
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:25,467
One more thing.

598
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:28,103
Did you ever hear about
another woman's body found

599
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:29,705
near Harry's rainbow grill?

600
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,107
It happened not too long ago.

601
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:34,877
She was badly beaten.

602
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:36,578
Knifed.

603
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,515
She was definitely murdered.

604
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:46,288
No. I didn't.

605
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,260
Kimmel.

606
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:53,829
Helen kimmel.

607
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:56,832
No.

608
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,433
I'm working that case too.

609
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:00,536
I haven't found the killer yet.

610
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,805
Well.

611
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:07,609
Thank you very much for coming
in. I'll be in touch soon.

612
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,952
Ellie:
Where are those Martinis?

613
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,254
Coming right up.

614
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:32,301
You ever been to Paris?

615
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,770
Of course. Have you?

616
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:36,572
No. I haven't.

617
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:38,907
All architects
ought to go to Paris.

618
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,010
- And all writers have to go--
- I know.

619
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,113
Somehow I never
got around to it.

620
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,050
Well.

621
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:49,918
It's still there.

622
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:03,632
It's that
goddamn detective corby.

623
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:06,268
Um.

624
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:08,870
You know.

625
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,440
Maybe it's better
if you weren't around.

626
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:12,574
Just come with me.

627
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:14,242
- Let's go downstairs.

628
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:15,944
Okay.

629
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,314
He won't stay long.

630
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,250
This is weird.

631
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:42,704
Good evening, Mr. Stackhouse.
Do you have a moment?

632
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:44,106
Yeah. Come on in.

633
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:02,024
I've interrupted you.
I can only apologize

634
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:02,824
yet again.

635
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,459
Walter: What did you wanna say?

636
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:05,627
Corby: I talked to kimmel.

637
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,430
- Kimmel?
- The man whose wife was killed

638
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:09,798
at Harry's rainbow grill.

639
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,968
- Oh. Yes.
- I'm convinced he's guilty.

640
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:14,536
So why tell me? I've--

641
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:18,073
everyone thinks it was some
sort of random maniac. But...

642
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,876
You've given me ideas.

643
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,114
Is this house your own design?

644
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:31,053
Very...

645
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:33,088
Adult.

646
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:36,124
Corby: Would you be willing
to show me around?

647
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:37,325
Walter: Sure.

648
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,295
Let's start back here.

649
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,334
Just my den.

650
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,838
May I? I'd like to
complete the picture.

651
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:03,418
Nice.

652
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:05,754
I like this.

653
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,171
What's this?

654
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:26,641
It's a kind of scrapbook.

655
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:30,779
Ideas. Pictures and things i
cut out of newspapers, you know?

656
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:35,417
They're my clippings.
Crazy stuff.

657
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,987
Inspirations for my
short stories that I write.

658
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:42,023
Maybe one day
I'll write a novel.

659
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:42,958
Who knows.

660
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:47,529
Quite a hobby.

661
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,409
This is about kimmel.

662
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,045
Is it?

663
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:06,047
My god.

664
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:08,083
You cut it out?

665
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,019
I must have. I don't remember.

666
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:17,058
I've hundreds of cuttings
of all sorts.

667
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,928
I just cut things out.

668
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:27,969
You've never actually
met kimmel? Have you?

669
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,208
Me? Kimmel? God no.

670
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,717
This doesn't look too good
for you, Mr. Stackhouse.

671
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:43,885
I don't like it.

672
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:52,460
Walter: I followed
Clara's bus to the rest stop.

673
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:55,564
I waited...

674
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:58,934
Looking all over for her
till the bus left.

675
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:00,936
And then I came home.

676
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,840
So you...

677
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,843
Knew she was missing and...

678
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,179
When you came to see me?

679
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:16,318
And later we...

680
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,886
Well, I couldn't understand it.

681
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:19,287
When she didn't get back on,

682
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:21,389
I thought maybe she'd
gotten off earlier.

683
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,293
Anyway. It was stupid of me.

684
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:27,629
She might have had
some crazy plan.

685
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:28,964
She knew where you lived.

686
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,299
She'd followed me there before.

687
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:33,568
The trouble is...

688
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,204
I was seen...

689
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,873
At the rest stop.

690
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,910
They might try to make
something of it. That's all.

691
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:44,546
Make something of it?

692
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:45,981
What are you talking about?

693
01:04:45,983 --> 01:04:47,649
What are they
gonna make of it?

694
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:53,488
- Walter, you're scaring me.
- No, don't be scared.

695
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,491
I haven't done anything.

696
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:03,331
But it could seem strange
that I followed her bus.

697
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,601
I don't know why I did it.

698
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:09,938
What will seem strange

699
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,274
is that you didn't tell
the police right away.

700
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,809
You told a stupid lie.

701
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:16,678
You panicked. Pure and simple.

702
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,079
Big deal.

703
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,916
You were in shock,
for god's sake.

704
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,786
I reckon once they check out
Clara's history it'll be over.

705
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:26,421
So just relax.

706
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,326
Though it might not be
a bad idea to get an attorney.

707
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:33,194
No. I...

708
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:34,829
No.

709
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:37,098
That'd make it look like
i have something to hide.

710
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,000
Ellie, can I get you a drink?

711
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,703
No. I have to go.

712
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:46,308
I have to get up early.
Call me later. Bye Jon.

713
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:54,649
I know what you're thinking.

714
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:56,985
Ellie complicates things.

715
01:05:58,387 --> 01:05:59,454
Well, yes.

716
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,658
Until this blows over, I'd keep
Ellie right out of the picture.

717
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:16,471
Corby:<i> I've got one</i>
<i> lying bastard and one...</i>

718
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,507
No. Make that
two lying bastards.

719
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:21,076
Both killed their wives.

720
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,278
I know it.

721
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,580
I'm watching them. Close.

722
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:28,783
Look. Stackhouse is
a classic copycat killer.

723
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:30,919
And kimmel is a psychopath.

724
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:32,354
His wife was in the way.

725
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:35,256
We need more than
your textbook theories, corby.

726
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:37,192
I'll give you a lot
more than that.

727
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:40,428
I don't think it's gonna
be long until I nail this.

728
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,731
Did you know Mrs. Stackhouse?

729
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,334
I only met her once.

730
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:49,871
Look, this isn't the best
time for me to talk to you.

731
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:52,640
And I don't like you
touching my things, okay?

732
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,714
I have rehearsal this morning.
I need to be there.

733
01:06:59,849 --> 01:06:59,848
Well.

734
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:03,051
I'm gonna have to
delay you, Ms. briess.

735
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:04,219
See, I'm a bit confused.

736
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:07,222
Your "friend" lied about where
he was the night his wife died

737
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:08,656
and now he's lied again.

738
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,226
Not that long ago

739
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:14,662
another woman's body was found
murdered at the same rest stop.

740
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:16,798
Mr. Stackhouse says
he'd never heard about it.

741
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,466
But guess what? He had.

742
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:20,969
I don't understand.

743
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,671
He's got a newspaper clipping
in his scrapbook

744
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:25,140
all about the case.

745
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:38,319
This is it.

746
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,057
I appreciate your cooperation.

747
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:50,465
I'm back.

748
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,600
And I've brought
someone with me.

749
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,203
Corby: Mr. kimmel,

750
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,406
I'd like you to meet
Mr. Stackhouse.

751
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,243
How do you do?

752
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:04,145
I'm good.

753
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,647
How are you?

754
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:09,117
You two have a lot in common.

755
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,219
This is your chance
to commiserate.

756
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:16,758
A strange thing...

757
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,195
Mr. Stackhouse was so interested
in the death of your wife,

758
01:08:20,197 --> 01:08:23,698
that he cut this out
and put it in his scrapbook.

759
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:27,302
Now why do you think
he would do a thing like that?

760
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:31,306
Hmmm?

761
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,409
I have no idea.

762
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,378
You should ask him.

763
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:43,151
I've already told you,
i cut out hundreds of things.

764
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,187
I write stories.

765
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,391
Do you have any particular

766
01:08:50,393 --> 01:08:52,560
literary interests,
Mr. Stackhouse?

767
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:57,732
I'm always interested
in rare architecture books.

768
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:00,835
You should browse our shelves.

769
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:03,838
I have a substantial collection.

770
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:07,709
I was right.

771
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,612
Common ground indeed.

772
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,249
And why shouldn't there be?

773
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:16,818
Kimmel...

774
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,586
You're a fucking liar!

775
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,624
You thought you were
home and dry. Admit it.

776
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:25,660
This guy, Stackhouse...

777
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:28,463
He threw a wrench
in your works, all right.

778
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,867
I don't know what you're
talking about, detective.

779
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:45,713
Are we through?

780
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:52,787
Yeah.

781
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:53,922
For today.

782
01:09:59,028 --> 01:09:59,961
Good bye.

783
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,151
Ellie: This is just too much!

784
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:27,689
Why, for god's sakes, go look at
a guy whose wife was murdered?

785
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:31,559
Just look at me and swear
to me you didn't do anything.

786
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:35,396
- You have to ask me that?
- I just want you to swear.

787
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:38,700
I did not kill Clara!

788
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,645
I don't know how this
has gotten so out of hand.

789
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,888
I can't get something
you said out of my mind.

790
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:05,493
What? Tell me. What?

791
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,732
"I have this fantasy
she's no longer there."

792
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,071
Is that the real
reason you lied?

793
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:20,975
Because you were thinking
about it all the time.

794
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,680
You were thinking about it
long before you met me.

795
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:10,692
Tony.

796
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:12,460
Please.

797
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:14,595
Excuse me, sir.

798
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:23,104
What do you want?

799
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,440
I wanna say thanks.

800
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:30,578
Whatever you did,
i want you to know that...

801
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:32,046
It doesn't matter to me.

802
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:33,748
I'm not guilty.

803
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,585
- Did it never cross your mind?
- No.

804
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:39,721
But it obviously crossed yours.

805
01:12:39,723 --> 01:12:40,822
But... I...

806
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:45,927
I didn't actually do it.

807
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:50,465
- But I feel--
- what do you feel?

808
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,568
I don't know.
I guess in some way that

809
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:56,003
we have something in common.

810
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:57,638
No. We have nothing in common.

811
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,140
We're all guilty of something.

812
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:02,543
I feel you are my guilt.

813
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:05,947
And what the hell
does that mean?

814
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:09,450
It means I share in your guilt.

815
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,754
I may have
thought about it, but...

816
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:14,155
But you did it.

817
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:15,790
Get out of here.

818
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,627
Do you realize
what you're doing to me?

819
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:21,229
You're ruining my life.

820
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:24,432
I can never tell when that cop
is gonna walk through that door.

821
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:26,868
I detest you.

822
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,704
Get out of my shop.

823
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:31,639
- Now.
- I'm sorry.

824
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:33,474
I really am.

825
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,079
Tony: You okay, Mr. kimmel?

826
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,914
That man pestering you?
Who is he?

827
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,315
Don't you worry.

828
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:44,152
I deal with customers
like him all the time.

829
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:46,754
He's a nobody.

830
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:06,774
Yes!

831
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:08,643
He was here.

832
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:10,111
So what?

833
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:12,246
And what did he have to say?

834
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:15,216
He said he was sorry
he brought the police down

835
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:17,185
on the head of
an innocent man.

836
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:20,788
Yeah? And what did you do?
Discuss architecture?

837
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,958
We're both innocent men.
In a similar situation.

838
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,928
Pursued by a man
who invents crimes.

839
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:32,800
Corby:
You're a sad bitch, kimmel.

840
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:34,101
Did you murder her for the

841
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:37,972
simple reason that you thought
that you married beneath you?

842
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,274
For that simple reason?
Who would believe it?

843
01:14:40,276 --> 01:14:42,009
Well. You know what?

844
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:43,744
I do.

845
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,049
A man of your intellect.

846
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,418
How did you ever
let that happen?

847
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:54,856
She was always bugging you
with her inane chatter.

848
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:57,091
So, you...

849
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,260
You got rid of her.

850
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:03,130
But you never reckoned
on Stackhouse, did you?

851
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:06,734
Now, admit...

852
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:12,173
That you know he's guilty
and you're as guilty as he is.

853
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:13,708
Admit it.

854
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,743
Tony: Is everything okay,
Mr. kimmel?

855
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:20,882
Tony: Mr. kimmel? You all right?

856
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:27,722
That's all for today.

857
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,959
See you tomorrow.

858
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:40,001
Corby is obsessed with me.

859
01:15:40,003 --> 01:15:42,203
You should see him.
He's eaten up. He's uh...

860
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,306
He's got it in his twisted
little mind that I killed Clara.

861
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,440
But Jesus!

862
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,709
To a lot of people
around here...

863
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:51,212
Certain things do seem
a little hard to figure out.

864
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:55,082
People can go to hell.
I'm through with it.

865
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,820
Maybe you should think about
taking some time out. You know?

866
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:02,089
Some sick leave.

867
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,525
Sick leave?

868
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,866
Well, I thought you must need
some time to yourself.

869
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:13,935
Oh.

870
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:15,937
You thought that, did you?

871
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:19,206
Well, thanks a lot, Jon.

872
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:37,758
Kimmel: Tony, open the door.

873
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,627
- Open up!
- Leave me alone.

874
01:16:39,629 --> 01:16:41,028
Kimmel: I can explain.

875
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,497
Just five minutes.

876
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:45,232
Tony: I'm calling the cops.
Go away.

877
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:47,768
You just give me five minutes.

878
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:49,070
Please.

879
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:51,138
That's all I ask. Five.

880
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:54,342
Open the door.

881
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:05,519
A Mr. schaeffer
is here to see you.

882
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:07,088
He says he has an appointment.

883
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:09,256
That's fine Martha. Send him in.

884
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:16,564
What are you doing here?

885
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:18,065
I think you owe me.

886
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,836
Corby knows you came
to see me, but I said nothing.

887
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:25,406
I didn't even give him this.

888
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:32,246
I think detective corby might
just make something of this.

889
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,950
Your little visit to your
favorite bookstore in Newark.

890
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,487
I want money.

891
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:45,159
A discreet arrangement
between you and me.

892
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:48,729
A serious way of saying sorry.

893
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,035
I'm not giving you
a fucking cent.

894
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:56,470
I can make you look very guilty.

895
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:59,140
No, you can't.
I haven't done anything.

896
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:01,275
You can't prove anything.

897
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,444
Proof is not the key thing.

898
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:05,880
It's doubt.

899
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,949
Doubt is everything.

900
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:11,185
You should know that.

901
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:15,690
I'll keep this safe.

902
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:17,692
Until I hear from you.

903
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:35,776
Detective corby!

904
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,345
Detective corby!

905
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:41,982
Mr. Stackhouse.

906
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:44,151
I need to talk to you.

907
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,354
I went to see kimmel.

908
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,724
I know. We've been
watching the shop.

909
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:52,993
No. I didn't mean
the other day. I went before.

910
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:56,163
I went before Clara died.

911
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:58,199
I went
to his bookstore in Newark.

912
01:18:58,567 --> 01:18:59,900
I ordered a book...

913
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:03,237
I left my name and address.

914
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:07,208
Jesus Christ.

915
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:09,610
Boy, I'm impressed.

916
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:13,748
Can you tell a lie?
Why did you go there?

917
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:16,650
I wanted to see kimmel.

918
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:17,985
Why? I don't get it.

919
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:20,721
Well, I know it sounds crazy,
but I wanted to see...

920
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:24,425
If he looked like a man
who could murder his wife.

921
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:27,027
It... fascinated me.

922
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:29,396
It fascinated you?

923
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:31,298
Yeah.

924
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,501
I'm a writer, remember?

925
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:36,670
As far as excuses go,
that one doesn't fly.

926
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:38,439
So, why are you telling me?

927
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,809
Well, he's got
my dated order slip.

928
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:45,212
He just tried to blackmail me.
It's laughable.

929
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,882
No. It's interesting.

930
01:19:47,884 --> 01:19:50,584
Well, it's a little
private transaction. I...

931
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,621
But I feel better
now that you know.

932
01:19:53,623 --> 01:19:56,323
I wanted to tell you.
He might have some

933
01:19:56,325 --> 01:19:57,858
fantastical story.

934
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,328
He won't need to use
too much imagination.

935
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:05,599
- I didn't do anything.
- So you keep saying.

936
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:08,102
What's the next revelation
gonna be, Mr. Stackhouse?

937
01:20:08,104 --> 01:20:10,204
I'm just watching you
digging your grave

938
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:12,273
and it's getting
deeper and deeper.

939
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:15,342
If you wanna press charges,
feel free.

940
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:38,165
This young man
wants to change his statement.

941
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,974
Corby: You fucked up trying
to blackmail Stackhouse

942
01:20:46,976 --> 01:20:48,876
with that order slip,
didn't you?

943
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:55,149
Big mistake.

944
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:58,252
I don't know
what you're getting at.

945
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:02,256
You get nailed.

946
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:05,025
I'm getting closer
and you know it.

947
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:08,395
He gets away with murder.
That's what I'm getting at.

948
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,065
You gotta face it.

949
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:14,168
He's got the cute blonde
to replace his wife.

950
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:16,570
His smart friends,
his neighbors.

951
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:18,038
Oh, yeah.

952
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:20,407
And he's stinking rich.

953
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:26,113
As for you kimmel...

954
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:27,281
Well...

955
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,187
The luck is just not
on your side now, is it?

956
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,760
I couldn't care less
about Stackhouse.

957
01:21:40,362 --> 01:21:42,529
Corby: Amazing, though,
isn't it?

958
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:46,033
Looks like he can actually
get away with it.

959
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:48,569
Corby: Scott free.

960
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:50,771
I told you I don't care.

961
01:21:50,773 --> 01:21:51,705
But...

962
01:21:51,707 --> 01:21:55,175
Your alibi is falling apart.
Could be death row for you

963
01:21:55,177 --> 01:21:57,511
while he's out there,
living the good life.

964
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:01,415
You're not gonna
get away with it.

965
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:05,185
Stackhouse
is your problem, kimmel.

966
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:22,303
Bus driver: Back on the bus
in 15 minutes.

967
01:22:22,305 --> 01:22:23,804
- Helen!
- Marty!

968
01:22:23,806 --> 01:22:25,472
What the hell
are you doing here?

969
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,241
Kimmel:
<i> I got something for you.</i>

970
01:22:27,243 --> 01:22:28,575
Helen:<i> You drive here</i>
<i> at night...</i>

971
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,978
<i> Without... who the hell</i>
<i> do you think you are?</i>

972
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:33,948
I told you to throw
that ugly jacket out.

973
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,883
My friends think
you look like a hobo.

974
01:22:35,885 --> 01:22:37,151
I can never ask--

975
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:10,184
Clara:<i> If you divorce me...</i>

976
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:12,753
<i> Then I will kill myself.</i>

977
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:18,025
Walter:<i> Do what you want.</i>
<i> It's your life.</i>

978
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,160
Walter:<i> Go right ahead.</i>

979
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:29,203
Go.

980
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,260
Corby: I've got a Jackson
following Stackhouse.

981
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:28,662
Kimmel's taken
the bait, all right.

982
01:24:28,664 --> 01:24:29,763
Let's stick with him.

983
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,465
He's lost control.

984
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:34,568
What do you think he's gonna do?

985
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:35,803
I don't know.

986
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:38,372
But I know what I hope
he's gonna do.

987
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:20,814
Why didn't Stackhouse
take a cab?

988
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:23,317
Where the fuck is he going?

989
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:26,620
I don't care. As long as
i have a ringside seat.

990
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:45,319
Aaargh!

991
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:48,722
Stackhouse! You blunderer!

992
01:28:48,724 --> 01:28:49,756
I did it.

993
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:41,875
- Police! Drop it!

994
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,787
- Jesus Christ.
- What a mess.

995
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:01,528
Walter:<i> I have this fantasy.</i>

996
01:30:01,763 --> 01:30:04,097
<i> I have this...</i>
<i> I have this fantasy.</i>

997
01:30:04,099 --> 01:30:07,334
<i> That she's no longer there.</i>
<i> I haven't done anything.</i>

998
01:30:07,336 --> 01:30:10,036
<i> I didn't set out</i>
<i> to tell such stupid lies.</i>

999
01:30:10,038 --> 01:30:12,439
<i> I wanted to see if he</i>
<i> looked like a man</i>

1000
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:13,707
<i> who murdered his wife.</i>

1001
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:16,343
<i> Wishing someone dead.</i>
<i> It's fascinating.</i>

1002
01:30:16,345 --> 01:30:18,678
<i> I haven't done anything wrong.</i>

1003
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,648
<i> We're all guilty of something.</i>
<i> I'm a writer.</i>

1004
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:25,719
- <i> I write stories.</i>
