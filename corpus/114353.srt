1
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,390
Hamlet, think of us as of a father...

2
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:36,231
for let the world take note:
You are the most immediate to our throne.

3
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,998
And with no less nobility of love...

4
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,163
than that which dearest father
bears his son...

5
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,832
do I impart toward you.

6
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,943
<i>Though yet of Hamlet</i>
<i>our dear brother's death...</i>

7
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:02,882
the memory be green...

8
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:08,055
and that it us befitted
to bear our hearts in grief...

9
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:12,519
and our whole kingdom
to be contracted in one brow of woe...

10
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,565
yet so far hath discretion fought
with nature...

11
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:23,169
that we with wisest sorrow think on him...

12
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:26,302
together with remembrance of ourselves.

13
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:33,139
Therefore our sometime sister,
now our queen...

14
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,110
the imperial jointress
to this warlike state...

15
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:41,088
have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy...

16
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:46,251
with one auspicious
and one dropping eye...

17
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:51,098
with mirth in funeral
and with dirge in marriage...

18
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,529
taken to wife.

19
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,487
And now, Laertes,
what's the news with you?

20
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:16,013
You told us of some suit.
What wouldst thou beg, Laertes?

21
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:19,719
My dread lord, my thoughts and wishes
bend again toward France...

22
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,663
and bow them to your gracious leave
and pardon.

23
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:25,563
Have you your father's leave?
What says Polonius?

24
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:30,496
He hath, my lord, wrung from me
my slow leave by laborsome petition...

25
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:34,302
and at last upon his will...

26
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,705
I sealed my hard consent.
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

27
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,778
Take thy fair hour, Laertes.

28
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:45,878
Time be thine,
and thy best graces spend it at thy will.

29
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:48,115
Farewell.

30
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,175
Hamlet?

31
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,622
And now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son.

32
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,431
A little more than kin, and less than kind.

33
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:37,565
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

34
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:40,709
Not so, my lord, I am too much in the sun.

35
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,679
'Tis sweet and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet...

36
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:48,444
to give these mourning duties
to your father.

37
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:51,743
But, you must know,
your father lost a father.

38
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:54,983
That father lost, lost his.

39
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,290
But to persever
in obstinate condolement...

40
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:03,730
is a course of impious stubbornness.

41
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:09,735
'Tis unmanly grief.
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven.

42
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:13,069
For your intent
in going back to school in Wittenberg...

43
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:15,337
it is most retrograde to our desire.

44
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,306
Be as ourself in Denmark.

45
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,872
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

46
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,953
Good Hamlet...

47
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,494
cast thy nighted color off...

48
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:42,896
and let thine eye
look like a friend on Denmark.

49
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:50,237
Do not for ever with thy veiled lids...

50
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:52,781
seek for thy noble father in the dust.

51
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,043
Thou knowest 'tis common.

52
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,544
All that lives must die...

53
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:01,846
passing through nature to eternity.

54
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:08,192
Ay, madam, it is common.

55
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:14,494
If it be,
why seems it so particular with thee?

56
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:18,533
Seems, madam! Nay, it is.

57
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,604
I know not "seems."

58
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:25,307
'Tis not alone my inky cloak,
good mother...

59
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:29,875
together with all forms, moods,
shapes of grief, that can denote me truly.

60
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,120
These indeed seem, for they are actions
that a man might play...

61
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,159
but I have that within which passes show.

62
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,365
These but the trappings
and the suits of woe.

63
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:47,334
Let not thy mother
lose her prayers, Hamlet.

64
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,572
I pray thee, stay with us.
Go not to Wittenberg.

65
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:05,118
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

66
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:16,562
This gentle and unforced accord
sits smiling to my heart.

67
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:46,450
That this too too solid flesh would melt...

68
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:51,628
thaw and resolve itself into a dew.

69
00:10:55,571 --> 00:11:00,304
Or that the Everlasting had not fixed
his canon against self-slaughter.

70
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:04,706
O God!

71
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:11,643
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable...

72
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,349
seem to me all the uses of this world.

73
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,891
Fie on it!

74
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:24,462
'Tis an unweeded garden
that grows to seed.

75
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,601
Things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely.

76
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,240
That it should come to this.

77
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:42,245
But two months dead.
Nay, not so much, not two.

78
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:45,653
So excellent a king...

79
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:49,987
that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr.

80
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:57,696
So loving to my mother that he might not
beteem the winds of heaven...

81
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,860
visit her face too roughly.

82
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:03,537
Heaven and earth, must I remember?

83
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,968
Why, she would hang on him...

84
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:10,705
as if increase of appetite
had grown by what it fed on.

85
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,672
And yet, within a month...
Let me not think on it.

86
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,448
Frailty, thy name is woman!

87
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:28,555
Dear Ophelia,
my necessaries are embarked.

88
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,428
Farewell.

89
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,737
And, sister...

90
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:42,674
for Hamlet, and the trifling of his favor...

91
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:45,407
hold it a fashion and a toy in blood.
No more.

92
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:49,573
- No more but so?
- Think it no more.

93
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:53,886
Perhaps he loves you now,
but you must fear...

94
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:56,754
his greatness weighed,
his will is not his own...

95
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:59,522
for he himself is subject to his birth.

96
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,825
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
carve for himself...

97
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:06,834
for on his choice depends
the safety and health of this whole state.

98
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,901
Then weigh what loss
your honor may sustain...

99
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:13,600
if with too credent ear you list his songs.

100
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,506
Yet here, Laertes?
Aboard, aboard, for shame!

101
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:26,715
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
and you are stayed for.

102
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,618
There, my blessing with thee.

103
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:35,458
These few precepts in thy memory
look thou character.

104
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:40,429
Give thy thoughts no tongue,
nor any unproportioned thought his act.

105
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:44,335
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.

106
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,409
Those friends thou hast,
and their adoption tried...

107
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:54,406
grapple them unto thy soul
with hoops of steel.

108
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:56,280
Beware of entrance to a quarrel...

109
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:59,150
but, being in, bear it
that the opposed may beware of thee.

110
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:01,746
Give every man thine ear,
but few thy voice.

111
00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:05,925
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy...

112
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:08,989
but not expressed in fancy.
Rich, not gaudy.

113
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:11,862
For the apparel oft proclaims the man.

114
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,893
Neither a borrower, nor a lender be.
For loan oft loses both itself and friend...

115
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:18,405
and borrowing
dulls the edge of husbandry.

116
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,284
This above all: To thine own self be true...

117
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:34,987
and it must follow, as the night the day...

118
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:37,855
thou canst not then be false to any man.

119
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:51,001
The time invites you.
Go, your servants tend.

120
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:02,813
Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
what I have said to you.

121
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:07,049
'Tis in my memory locked,
and you yourself shall keep the key of it.

122
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:27,837
What is it, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

123
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:32,708
So please you,
something touching the Lord Hamlet.

124
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:34,913
Marry, well bethought.

125
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:39,046
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
given private time to you.

126
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:42,655
He hath, my lord, of late
made many tenders of his affection to me.

127
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:43,817
Affection?

128
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,155
Do you believe his tenders,
as you call them?

129
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:55,830
I do not know, my lord,
what I should think.

130
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,665
I will teach you.

131
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:01,034
Tender yourself more dearly.

132
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,207
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
in honorable fashion.

133
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:09,614
Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to!

134
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:14,411
And hath given countenance to his speech
with almost all the holy vows of heaven.

135
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,685
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.

136
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:22,491
I do know, when the blood burns, how
prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows.

137
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,896
I would not, in plain terms,
from this time forth...

138
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:27,629
have you give words
or talk with the Lord Hamlet.

139
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:30,399
Look to it, I charge you! Come your ways.

140
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:40,712
I shall obey, my lord.

141
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:01,099
Hail to your lordship!

142
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:04,002
Horatio, or I do forget myself.

143
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,643
- How fare you, sirs?
- My lord.

144
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:11,509
I am very glad to see you.

145
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,810
But what, in faith,
make you from Wittenberg?

146
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:18,920
- A truant's disposition, good my lord.
- I would not hear your enemy say so.

147
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,381
I know you are no truant.

148
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,188
But what is your affair in Elsinore?

149
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:27,827
My lord, I came to see
your father's funeral.

150
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:30,023
I pray thee, do not mock me,
fellow student.

151
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:32,590
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

152
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:35,067
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.

153
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,934
Thrift, Horatio.

154
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,705
The funeral baked meats did
coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.

155
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:50,650
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
ere ever I had seen that day, Horatio.

156
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:54,712
My father, methinks I see my father.

157
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:00,721
I saw him once. He was a goodly king.

158
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:03,857
He was a man, take him for all in all.

159
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,898
I shall not look upon his like again.

160
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,494
My lord...

161
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,743
I think I saw him yesternight.

162
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,408
Saw? Who?

163
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,815
My lord, the king your father.

164
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:27,380
The king, my father?

165
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,552
Season your admiration for a while
with an attent ear...

166
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:34,722
till I may deliver, upon the witness
of these gentlemen, this marvel to you.

167
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,996
For God's love, let me hear.

168
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,368
Two nights together
had these gentlemen...

169
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:47,567
in the dead waste and middle of the night,
been thus encountered:

170
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:50,635
A figure like your father
appears before them.

171
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,382
Thrice he walked by
their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes...

172
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,418
within their truncheon's length...

173
00:18:57,486 --> 00:19:00,785
whilst they, distilled almost to jelly
with the act of fear...

174
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:03,086
stand dumb and speak not to him.

175
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:05,820
This to me in dreadful secrecy
impart they did...

176
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,362
and I with them
the third night kept the watch...

177
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:13,333
where, as they had delivered,
both in time, form of the thing...

178
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,863
each word made true and good,
the apparition comes.

179
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:24,236
I knew your father.
These hands are not more like.

180
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,307
- But where was this?
- Upon the platform where we watch.

181
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,046
- Did you not speak to it?
- My lord, I did, but answer made it none.

182
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,489
Yet once methought it lifted up its head...

183
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:40,225
and did address itself to motion,
like as it would speak.

184
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,128
But even then
the morning cock crew loud...

185
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:48,501
and at the sound it shrank in haste away
and vanished from our sight.

186
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,798
'Tis very strange.

187
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:57,444
- As I do live, my honored lord, 'tis true.
- Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.

188
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,270
- Hold you the watch tonight?
- We do, my lord.

189
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:01,976
What, looked he frowningly?

190
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,245
A countenance more in sorrow
than in anger.

191
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,288
- And fixed his eyes upon you?
- Most constantly.

192
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:11,151
- I would I had been there.
- It would have much amazed you.

193
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:16,187
I will watch tonight.
Perchance it will walk again.

194
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:18,125
I warrant it will.

195
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:30,174
If you have hitherto concealed this sight,
let it be tenable in your silence still.

196
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:32,577
Our duty to your honor.

197
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:35,675
Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.

198
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,050
My father's spirit.

199
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,352
All is not well.

200
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,360
I doubt some foul play.

201
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:52,095
Would the night were come.
Till then sit still, my soul.

202
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:57,103
Foul deeds will rise...

203
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,305
though all the earth overwhelm them,
to men's eyes.

204
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:46,485
No jocund health
that Denmark drinks today...

205
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,082
but the great cannon
to the clouds shall tell!

206
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:52,488
What does this mean, my lord?
Is it a custom?

207
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,926
Ay, marry is it.

208
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:58,362
But to my mind a custom more honored
in the breach than the observance.

209
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:05,399
This heavy-headed revel east and west...

210
00:22:05,474 --> 00:22:08,307
makes us traduced and taxed
of other nations.

211
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:10,801
They clepe us drunkards...

212
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:14,576
and indeed, it soils the pith and marrow
of our attribute.

213
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:42,238
The air bites shrewdly. It is very cold.

214
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,246
What hour now?

215
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:50,308
It draws near the season
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

216
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,831
So oft it chances in particular men...

217
00:23:11,406 --> 00:23:14,466
that for some vicious mole of nature
in them...

218
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,742
their virtues else,
be they as pure as grace...

219
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,876
shall in the general censure
take corruption...

220
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,113
from that particular fault.

221
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,431
Look, my lord, it comes!

222
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,014
Angels and ministers of grace defend us.

223
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:17,895
Be thou a spirit of health
or goblin damned...

224
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:21,542
bring with thee airs from heaven
or blasts from hell...

225
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,238
be thy intents wicked or charitable...

226
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,476
I will speak to thee.

227
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,948
I'll call thee Hamlet...

228
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,880
King, father...

229
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:38,524
royal Dane.

230
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:42,396
Answer me.

231
00:25:00,348 --> 00:25:03,909
- Do not, my lord.
- Why, what should be the fear?

232
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:07,411
I do not set my life at a pin's fee.

233
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:12,122
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
being a thing immortal as itself?

234
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:14,662
What if it tempt you toward the flood,
my lord...

235
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:18,597
or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
that beetles over his base into the sea...

236
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,794
and there assume
some other horrible form...

237
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:24,896
which might deprive your sovereignty
of reason and draw you into madness?

238
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:26,372
Think of it.

239
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:31,976
I'll follow it.

240
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:35,977
- You shall not go, my lord!
- Hold off your hands!

241
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:39,043
By heaven,
I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!

242
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:40,586
I say, away!

243
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:01,175
Go on, I'll follow thee.

244
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:38,207
- My lord.
- My lord Hamlet!

245
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,441
My lord!

246
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:19,845
I am thy father's spirit...

247
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:24,516
doomed for a certain term
to walk the night...

248
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:30,825
and for the day confined to fast in fires.

249
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:37,065
But that I am forbid
to tell the secrets of my prison-house...

250
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:40,270
I could a tale unfold...

251
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:43,610
whose lightest word
would harrow up thy soul.

252
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,174
List.

253
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,256
If thou didst ever thy dear father love...

254
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,892
revenge his foul
and most unnatural murder.

255
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:05,724
Murder?

256
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,327
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.

257
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:14,005
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.

258
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,934
'Tis given out...

259
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:21,209
that sleeping in my orchard,
a serpent stung me.

260
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:24,078
But know, thou noble youth...

261
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:28,952
the serpent that did sting thy father's life
now wears his crown.

262
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,989
O my prophetic soul!

263
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:35,591
My uncle.

264
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:39,225
Ay, that incestuous,
that adulterate beast...

265
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:43,560
with witchcraft of his wit,
with traitorous gifts...

266
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,065
won to his shameful lust...

267
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,542
the will
of my most seeming-virtuous queen.

268
00:28:52,113 --> 00:28:53,444
But, soft.

269
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,720
Methinks I scent the morning air.

270
00:29:05,427 --> 00:29:07,088
Brief let me be.

271
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,025
Sleeping within my orchard...

272
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,425
my custom always of the afternoon...

273
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,696
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole...

274
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:22,969
with juice of cursed hebona in a vial...

275
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:27,671
and in the porches of mine ears
did pour the leprous distilment.

276
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:33,684
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand...

277
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:38,387
of life, of crown, of queen,
at once dispatched...

278
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:43,060
cut off even in the blossoms of my sin...

279
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,363
no reckoning made...

280
00:29:48,136 --> 00:29:52,869
but sent to my account
with all my imperfections on my head.

281
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,941
Oh, horrible!

282
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,406
Most horrible.

283
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:10,049
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.

284
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,860
Let not the royal bed of Denmark...

285
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:18,092
be a couch for luxury and damned incest.

286
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:24,034
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act...

287
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:27,937
taint not thy mind...

288
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:34,014
nor let thy soul contrive
against thy mother aught.

289
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,346
Leave her to heaven...

290
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:44,517
and to those thorns that
in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her.

291
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:49,052
Fare thee well at once.

292
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:53,298
The glow-worm
shows the matin to be near...

293
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:58,130
and begins to pale his uneffectual fire.

294
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:04,037
Adieu.

295
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:21,160
Remember me.

296
00:31:37,011 --> 00:31:38,501
Remember thee?

297
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,941
Ay, thou poor ghost...

298
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:50,890
whiles memory holds a seat
in this distracted globe.

299
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,293
Remember thee?

300
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,496
Yea, from the table of my memory...

301
00:31:58,566 --> 00:32:02,593
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records...

302
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,734
and thy commandment
all alone shall live...

303
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:08,571
within the book and volume of my brain...

304
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:10,907
unmixed with baser matter.

305
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,839
Yes, by heaven!

306
00:32:29,797 --> 00:32:32,960
O most pernicious woman!

307
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,470
O villain!

308
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:41,302
Villain, smiling, damned villain!

309
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,538
My tables, meet it is I set it down.

310
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,647
That one may smile...

311
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,879
and smile...

312
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,584
and be a villain!

313
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:06,197
So, uncle...

314
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:09,130
there you are.

315
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:11,765
Now to my word.

316
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:18,005
It is, "Adieu, adieu.

317
00:33:19,313 --> 00:33:20,803
"Remember me."

318
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:24,341
I have sworn it.

319
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:32,988
So be it.

320
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:36,359
Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!

321
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:41,501
Hillo, ho, ho, boy. Come, bird, come.

322
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:48,706
What news?

323
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:54,611
- No, you will reveal it.
- Not I, my lord, by heaven.

324
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:58,181
There's never a villain dwelling
in all Denmark...

325
00:33:58,252 --> 00:34:00,311
but he's an arrant knave.

326
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:05,186
There needs no ghost, my lord,
come from the grave, to tell us this.

327
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:08,524
Right, you are in the right.
So I hold it fit we shake hands and part.

328
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:10,564
These are but wild and whirling words.

329
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,498
I am sorry they offend you, heartily.
Yes, faith, heartily.

330
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:17,971
- There's no offense, my lord.
- There is, Horatio, and much offense, too.

331
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:23,441
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.

332
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:29,581
And now, good friends,
grant me one poor request.

333
00:34:30,084 --> 00:34:32,609
Never make known
what you have seen tonight.

334
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:36,252
- We will not.
- Upon my sword.

335
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,814
<i>Swear.</i>

336
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:48,566
Swear by my sword
never to speak of this that you have seen.

337
00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:50,967
Never to speak of this
that you have heard.

338
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:53,268
<i>Swear by his sword.</i>

339
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,866
Day and night,
but this is wondrous strange.

340
00:34:55,943 --> 00:34:58,844
And therefore as a stranger
give it welcome.

341
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,445
There are more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio...

342
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:05,345
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

343
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,616
But come!

344
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,890
Here, as before, never,
so help you mercy...

345
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:17,462
how strange or odd so ever I bear myself...

346
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,898
as I perchance hereafter shall think meet
to put an antic disposition on...

347
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:25,071
never to note that you know aught of me.

348
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:26,964
This do swear!

349
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:30,235
We swear.

350
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:38,474
Rest.

351
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,713
Rest, perturbed spirit!

352
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,588
The time is out of joint.

353
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:56,603
O cursed spite,
that ever I was born to set it right.

354
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:08,379
<i>Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's Day</i>

355
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:11,351
<i>All in the morning betime</i>

356
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:14,746
<i>And I a maid</i>

357
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:19,584
<i>At your window</i>

358
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,992
<i>To be your Valentine</i>

359
00:37:47,882 --> 00:37:49,873
- My lord!
- How now?

360
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:59,150
I think it sure that I have found
the very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

361
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,458
Speak on that, that I do long to hear.

362
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,494
My liege, and madam...

363
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:08,658
to expostulate what majesty should be,
what duty is...

364
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:11,967
why day is day, night night,
and time is time...

365
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,608
were nothing but to waste night,
day, and time.

366
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:19,407
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
I will be brief.

367
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,580
Your noble son is mad.

368
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:29,318
Mad call I it...

369
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,791
for, to define true madness,
what is it but to be nothing else but mad?

370
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,693
- But let that go.
- More matter, with less art.

371
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:38,425
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.

372
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:41,400
That he is mad, 'tis pity, 'tis true.

373
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:43,960
'Tis true 'tis pity, and pity 'tis 'tis true.

374
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:47,599
A foolish figure, but farewell it,
for I will use no art.

375
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:50,370
Mad let us grant him, then.

376
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,478
And now remains...

377
00:38:53,848 --> 00:38:56,817
that we find out the cause of this effect.

378
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:03,984
Or rather say, the cause of this defect...

379
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:07,391
for this effect defective comes by cause.

380
00:39:07,461 --> 00:39:11,261
Thus it remains,
and the remainder thus. Perpend.

381
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:24,175
I have a daughter,
have while she is mine...

382
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:29,343
who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
hath given me this.

383
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:31,884
Now, gather and surmise.

384
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:37,286
"To the celestial...

385
00:39:37,525 --> 00:39:40,858
"and my soul's idol,
the most beautified Ophelia."

386
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:46,059
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase.
"Beautified" is a vile phrase.

387
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,896
But you shall hear.

388
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:50,469
Came this from Hamlet to her?

389
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:53,732
Good madam, stay awhile.
I will be faithful.

390
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:57,676
"Doubt thou the stars are fire.

391
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:00,941
"Doubt that the sun doth move.

392
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:04,176
"Doubt truth to be a liar.

393
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,116
"But never doubt I love.

394
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:10,922
"Thine evermore, most dear lady...

395
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,586
"whilst this machine is to him, Hamlet."

396
00:40:15,296 --> 00:40:17,491
This in obedience
hath my daughter shown me.

397
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:20,056
But how hath she received his love?

398
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:29,303
- What do you think of me?
- As of a man faithful and honorable.

399
00:40:29,443 --> 00:40:33,402
I would fain prove so. And
my young mistress thus I did bespeak...

400
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:36,277
that she should lock herself
from his resort.

401
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,148
Thus he repelled, a short tale to make...

402
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:42,716
fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
thence to a lightness...

403
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,918
and by this declension
into the madness wherein now he raves...

404
00:40:45,993 --> 00:40:47,824
and all we mourn for.

405
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:55,430
Hath there been such a time,
I would fain know that...

406
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:58,700
that I have positively said,
"'Tis so," when it proved otherwise?

407
00:40:58,772 --> 00:41:02,538
- Not that I know.
- Take this from this, if this be otherwise.

408
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,872
How may we try it further?

409
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:12,381
You know, sometimes he walks
four hours together here in the lobby.

410
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:13,613
So he does indeed.

411
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:15,882
At such a time,
I'll loose my daughter to him.

412
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:19,392
Be you and I behind an arras then.
Mark the encounter.

413
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,918
If he love her not, and be not
from his reason fallen thereon...

414
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,865
let me be no assistant for a state.

415
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:28,959
But look where sadly
the poor wretch comes reading.

416
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,431
I'll board him presently.

417
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,772
Do you think 'tis this?

418
00:41:43,384 --> 00:41:45,909
I doubt it is no other but the main.

419
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:50,514
His father's death,
and our overhasty marriage.

420
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:14,447
Do you know me, my lord?

421
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:17,647
Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.

422
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:23,284
- Not I, my lord.
- Then I would you were so honest a man.

423
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:25,856
Honest, my lord?

424
00:42:25,926 --> 00:42:30,488
To be honest, as this world goes,
is to be one man picked out of 10,000.

425
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:32,862
For if the sun breed maggots
in a dead dog...

426
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:35,128
being a good kissing carrion...

427
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,406
- Have you a daughter?
- I have, my lord.

428
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,837
Let her not walk in the sun.

429
00:42:42,243 --> 00:42:46,009
Conception is a blessing,
but as your daughter may conceive...

430
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,241
Friend, look to it.

431
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,158
Still harping on my daughter.

432
00:43:01,762 --> 00:43:03,787
What do you read, my lord?

433
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,360
Words.

434
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,303
What is the matter, my lord?

435
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,342
- Between who?
- The matter that you read.

436
00:43:24,285 --> 00:43:25,775
Slanders, sir.

437
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:31,251
For the satirical rogue says here
that old men have gray beards...

438
00:43:31,558 --> 00:43:33,116
their faces are wrinkled...

439
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:36,458
their eyes purging thick amber
and plum-tree gum...

440
00:43:38,632 --> 00:43:42,693
and that they have a plentiful lack of wit,
together with most weak hams.

441
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,136
How pregnant sometimes his replies are.

442
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:48,936
All of which, sir, I most powerfully
and potently believe...

443
00:43:49,276 --> 00:43:52,643
yet I hold it not honesty
to have it thus set down.

444
00:43:53,013 --> 00:43:57,609
For you yourself shall be old as I am,
if, like a crab, you could go backward.

445
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,114
My lord!

446
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:09,018
My honorable lord,
I will most humbly take my leave.

447
00:44:09,163 --> 00:44:11,791
You cannot, sir, take from me anything...

448
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:14,561
that I will more willingly part withal.

449
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:18,161
Except my life.

450
00:44:40,828 --> 00:44:44,821
Ophelia, I do wish
that your good beauties...

451
00:44:45,032 --> 00:44:47,762
be the happy cause of Hamlet's wildness.

452
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:52,835
So shall I hope your virtues
will bring him to his wonted way again...

453
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,870
to both your honors.

454
00:44:56,477 --> 00:44:58,274
Madam, I wish it may.

455
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,528
Ophelia, walk you here.

456
00:45:16,663 --> 00:45:19,860
Gracious, so please you,
we will bestow ourselves.

457
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:22,162
Read on this book.

458
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,667
He is coming. Let us withdraw, my lord.

459
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,526
Nymph, in thy orisons
be all my sins remembered.

460
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:53,256
Good my lord...

461
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:56,433
how does your honor for this many a day?

462
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,471
I humbly thank you, well.

463
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:02,103
My lord, I have remembrances of yours...

464
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,938
that I have longed long to redeliver.

465
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:10,012
I pray you now, receive them.

466
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,517
No, not I. I never gave you aught.

467
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:16,447
My honored lord,
you know right well you did.

468
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,384
And with them
words of so sweet breath composed...

469
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:22,656
as made the things more rich.

470
00:46:27,468 --> 00:46:30,335
Their perfume lost, take these again.

471
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,398
There, my lord.

472
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:45,375
- Are you honest?
- My lord?

473
00:46:45,919 --> 00:46:48,649
- Are you fair?
- What means your lordship?

474
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,289
That if you be honest and fair...

475
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,794
your honesty should admit
no discourse to your beauty.

476
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:59,730
Could beauty, my lord,
have better commerce than with honesty?

477
00:47:01,835 --> 00:47:03,598
I did love you once.

478
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,605
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

479
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,406
You should not have believed me.
I loved you not!

480
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:15,644
Where's your father?

481
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:19,578
At home, my lord.

482
00:47:21,622 --> 00:47:23,988
Let the doors be shut upon him...

483
00:47:24,057 --> 00:47:27,493
that he may play the fool nowhere
but in his own house!

484
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:31,589
If thou dost marry,
I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry.

485
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:34,896
Be thou as chaste as ice,
as pure as snow...

486
00:47:34,968 --> 00:47:37,198
thou shalt not escape calumny!

487
00:47:37,404 --> 00:47:39,872
Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool...

488
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,740
for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them.

489
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:46,706
I have heard of your paintings
well enough.

490
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,511
God hath given you one face
and you make yourselves another.

491
00:47:50,717 --> 00:47:54,312
You jig and amble, and you lisp.
You nickname God's creatures...

492
00:47:54,388 --> 00:47:56,754
and make your wantonness
your ignorance.

493
00:47:56,823 --> 00:48:01,192
Go to! I'll no more on it.
It hath made me mad!

494
00:48:02,763 --> 00:48:05,288
I say we will have no more marriage.

495
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:11,230
Those that are married already,
all but one, shall live.

496
00:48:11,705 --> 00:48:14,299
The rest shall keep as they are.

497
00:48:28,455 --> 00:48:31,982
We must watch him,
and that most carefully.

498
00:48:37,297 --> 00:48:40,357
I have in quick determination
thus set it down:

499
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:46,403
He shall with speed to England,
for the demand of our neglected tribute.

500
00:48:48,275 --> 00:48:51,438
Haply the seas and countries
different with variable objects...

501
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:55,675
shall expel this something-settled matter
in his heart.

502
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:09,492
Madness in great ones
must not unwatched go.

503
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:37,654
To be, or not to be. That is the question.

504
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:45,397
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer the slings and arrows...

505
00:49:45,465 --> 00:49:47,433
of outrageous fortune...

506
00:49:51,104 --> 00:49:54,039
or to take arms against a sea of troubles...

507
00:49:56,376 --> 00:49:59,209
and by opposing end them?

508
00:50:01,848 --> 00:50:03,110
To die...

509
00:50:06,353 --> 00:50:09,413
to sleep no more.

510
00:50:14,528 --> 00:50:18,828
And, by a sleep to say
we end the heartache...

511
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:22,901
and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to...

512
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:27,604
'tis a consummation...

513
00:50:29,342 --> 00:50:31,207
devoutly to be wished.

514
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:35,743
To die...

515
00:50:38,051 --> 00:50:39,313
to sleep.

516
00:50:45,692 --> 00:50:48,024
To sleep, perchance to dream.

517
00:50:48,361 --> 00:50:50,124
Ay, there's the rub.

518
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,433
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come...

519
00:50:58,471 --> 00:51:01,406
when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil...

520
00:51:01,474 --> 00:51:03,135
must give us pause.

521
00:51:03,209 --> 00:51:05,268
There's the respect...

522
00:51:05,345 --> 00:51:09,281
that makes calamity of so long life.

523
00:51:13,286 --> 00:51:17,086
For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time...

524
00:51:17,757 --> 00:51:21,420
the oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely...

525
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:25,994
the pangs of disprized love,
the law's delay...

526
00:51:26,065 --> 00:51:28,863
the insolence of office, and the spurns...

527
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:33,200
that patient merit of the unworthy takes...

528
00:51:37,877 --> 00:51:42,075
when he himself might his quietus make...

529
00:51:44,117 --> 00:51:46,108
with a bare bodkin?

530
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,428
Who would fardels bear...

531
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:01,957
to grunt and sweat under a weary life...

532
00:52:03,636 --> 00:52:07,094
but that the dread
of something after death...

533
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:11,270
the undiscovered country...

534
00:52:11,344 --> 00:52:15,610
from whose bourn no traveler returns...

535
00:52:16,115 --> 00:52:17,844
puzzles the will...

536
00:52:19,285 --> 00:52:23,449
and makes us
rather bear those ills we have...

537
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,255
than fly to others that we know not of?

538
00:52:31,564 --> 00:52:35,864
Thus conscience
does make cowards of us all...

539
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:41,499
and thus the native hue of resolution...

540
00:52:41,574 --> 00:52:45,169
is sicklied over
with the pale cast of thought...

541
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,240
and enterprises of great pitch
and moment...

542
00:52:51,317 --> 00:52:55,447
with this regard their currents turn awry...

543
00:52:58,658 --> 00:53:01,183
and lose the name of action.

544
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,664
- My honored lord.
- My most dear lord.

545
00:53:52,478 --> 00:53:54,503
My excellent good friends.

546
00:53:55,448 --> 00:53:59,316
How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Rosencrantz?

547
00:54:01,053 --> 00:54:03,146
Good lads, how do you both?

548
00:54:06,726 --> 00:54:09,889
What have you, my good friends,
deserved at the hands of fortune...

549
00:54:09,962 --> 00:54:11,827
that she sends you to prison hither?

550
00:54:11,898 --> 00:54:14,492
- Prison, my lord?
- Denmark's a prison.

551
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:16,858
We think not so, my lord.

552
00:54:17,537 --> 00:54:19,232
Why, then, 'tis none to you...

553
00:54:19,605 --> 00:54:22,699
for there is nothing good or bad
but thinking makes it so.

554
00:54:22,775 --> 00:54:24,743
To me it is a prison.

555
00:54:25,244 --> 00:54:28,577
Why, then your ambition makes it one.
It is too narrow for your mind.

556
00:54:28,648 --> 00:54:29,876
Oh, God.

557
00:54:29,982 --> 00:54:34,715
I could be bounded in a nutshell,
and count myself a king of infinite space...

558
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:40,217
- were it not that I have had bad dreams.
- Which dreams, indeed, are ambition...

559
00:54:40,293 --> 00:54:44,821
for the very substance of the ambitious
is merely the shadow of a dream.

560
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,859
Shall we away?
For, by my fay, I cannot reason.

561
00:55:16,462 --> 00:55:18,487
What make you at Elsinore?

562
00:55:18,864 --> 00:55:21,662
To visit you, my lord. No other occasion.

563
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:27,439
Beggar that I am,
I am even poor in thanks.

564
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:31,905
But, my dear friends,
were you not sent for?

565
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,073
Is it your own inclining?

566
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,988
Is it a free visitation?

567
00:55:44,223 --> 00:55:48,125
Come, come, deal justly with me.
Come, come. Nay, speak.

568
00:55:49,328 --> 00:55:52,422
- What should we say?
- Why, anything, but to the purpose.

569
00:55:52,498 --> 00:55:55,433
There is a kind of confession in your looks.

570
00:55:56,202 --> 00:56:00,195
I know the good King and Queen
have sent for you.

571
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:03,640
To what end?

572
00:56:04,744 --> 00:56:06,678
That you must teach me.

573
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:14,280
Be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for or no!

574
00:56:14,487 --> 00:56:17,320
My lord, we were sent for.

575
00:56:19,759 --> 00:56:21,624
I will tell you why.

576
00:56:23,396 --> 00:56:26,559
So shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery...

577
00:56:26,632 --> 00:56:30,090
and your secrecy to the king and queen
molt no feather.

578
00:56:36,842 --> 00:56:41,575
I have of late, but wherefore I know not,
lost all my mirth...

579
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,583
forgone all custom of exercises.

580
00:56:46,919 --> 00:56:49,717
And indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition...

581
00:56:49,789 --> 00:56:52,587
that this goodly frame, the earth...

582
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,920
seems to me a sterile promontory.

583
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:02,797
This most excellent canopy,
the air, look you...

584
00:57:02,868 --> 00:57:05,359
this brave overhanging firmament...

585
00:57:05,638 --> 00:57:08,766
this majestical roof
fretted with golden fire...

586
00:57:10,242 --> 00:57:12,107
Why, it appeareth nothing to me...

587
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:16,012
but a foul and pestilent
congregation of vapors.

588
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:33,762
What a piece of work is a man.

589
00:57:35,601 --> 00:57:37,466
How noble in reason.

590
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,331
How infinite in faculties.

591
00:57:40,539 --> 00:57:43,838
In form and moving,
how express and admirable.

592
00:57:45,678 --> 00:57:49,512
In action, how like an angel,
in apprehension, how like a god.

593
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:53,513
The beauty of the world,
the paragon of animals.

594
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,813
And yet, to me...

595
00:57:57,723 --> 00:58:00,157
what is this quintessence of dust?

596
00:58:03,596 --> 00:58:05,461
Man delights not me.

597
00:58:06,966 --> 00:58:08,957
No, nor woman neither...

598
00:58:09,034 --> 00:58:10,934
though, by your smiling,
you seem to say so.

599
00:58:11,003 --> 00:58:13,733
- There was no such stuff in my thoughts.
- Why laugh then...

600
00:58:13,806 --> 00:58:17,435
- when I said, "Man delights not me"?
- To think, if you delight not in man...

601
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:20,809
what Lenten entertainment
the players shall receive.

602
00:58:35,361 --> 00:58:37,955
Just the same as ever before. Come on.

603
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,757
Boys, take the horses.

604
00:58:40,566 --> 00:58:41,760
Out of the way!

605
00:58:46,672 --> 00:58:49,266
Masters, you are welcome to Elsinore.

606
00:59:30,015 --> 00:59:32,745
Good my lord,
will you see the players well bestowed?

607
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:35,651
For they are the abstract
and brief chronicles of the time.

608
00:59:35,721 --> 00:59:38,189
After your death
you were better have a bad epitaph...

609
00:59:38,257 --> 00:59:40,851
than their ill report while you live.

610
00:59:41,026 --> 00:59:45,656
- I shall use them according to their desert.
- God's bodkins, man, much better.

611
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:49,532
Use every man after his desert,
and who shall escape whipping?

612
00:59:53,305 --> 00:59:54,772
Take them in.

613
00:59:55,441 --> 00:59:57,204
Follow him, friends.

614
00:59:58,377 --> 01:00:00,174
We'll hear a play tomorrow.

615
01:00:11,056 --> 01:00:12,580
My lord Hamlet!

616
01:00:14,293 --> 01:00:16,955
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.

617
01:00:17,029 --> 01:00:20,021
But my uncle-father and aunt-mother
are deceived.

618
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:21,964
In what, my dear lord?

619
01:00:22,067 --> 01:00:24,297
I am but mad north-north-west.

620
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:29,404
When the wind is southerly
I know a hawk from a handsaw.

621
01:00:55,534 --> 01:00:57,024
Am I a coward?

622
01:00:58,304 --> 01:01:01,865
'Swounds, it cannot be
but I am pigeon-livered...

623
01:01:01,941 --> 01:01:04,535
and lack gall to make oppression bitter...

624
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:08,205
or ere this I should have fatted
all the region kites...

625
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,180
with this slave's offal!

626
01:01:10,649 --> 01:01:12,549
Bloody, bawdy villain!

627
01:01:13,218 --> 01:01:17,917
Remorseless, treacherous,
lecherous, kindless villain!

628
01:01:19,158 --> 01:01:21,854
O vengeance!

629
01:01:26,532 --> 01:01:28,397
Why, what an ass am I.

630
01:01:29,401 --> 01:01:31,198
This is most brave...

631
01:01:32,338 --> 01:01:35,273
that I, the son of a dear father murdered...

632
01:01:35,841 --> 01:01:39,174
prompted to my revenge
by heaven and hell...

633
01:01:39,778 --> 01:01:44,044
must, like a whore,
unpack my heart with words...

634
01:01:47,586 --> 01:01:52,489
and fall a-cursing
like a very drab, a scullion!

635
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,689
Fie! Foh!

636
01:01:56,495 --> 01:01:58,656
About, my brains.

637
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:11,266
Give me that.

638
01:02:11,977 --> 01:02:13,342
It's heavy!

639
01:02:23,155 --> 01:02:26,818
I have heard
that guilty creatures sitting at a play...

640
01:02:27,793 --> 01:02:31,923
have by the very cunning of the scene
been struck so to the soul...

641
01:02:32,364 --> 01:02:35,822
that presently they have proclaimed
their malefactions.

642
01:02:37,102 --> 01:02:40,401
I'll have these players play something
like the murder of my father...

643
01:02:40,472 --> 01:02:41,734
before mine uncle.

644
01:02:41,807 --> 01:02:45,174
I'll observe his looks.
I'll tent him to the quick.

645
01:02:45,778 --> 01:02:48,941
If he do blench, I know my course.

646
01:02:51,116 --> 01:02:53,744
The spirit that I have seen may be a devil...

647
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:57,255
and the devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape, yea.

648
01:02:57,556 --> 01:02:59,854
And perhaps out of my weakness
and my melancholy...

649
01:02:59,925 --> 01:03:03,861
as he is very potent with such spirits,
abuses me to damn me.

650
01:03:05,297 --> 01:03:08,130
I'll have grounds more relative than this.

651
01:03:12,671 --> 01:03:14,571
The play's the thing...

652
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,437
wherein I'll catch
the conscience of the king.

653
01:03:20,846 --> 01:03:23,246
'Tis almost the time, my friends.

654
01:03:27,753 --> 01:03:29,084
Haste you!

655
01:03:33,492 --> 01:03:34,959
Observe my uncle.

656
01:03:35,027 --> 01:03:38,827
If his occulted guilt
do not itself unkennel in one speech...

657
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:43,695
it is a damned ghost that we have seen,
and my imaginations all are foul.

658
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:48,599
- I must be idle. Get you a place.
- Well, my lord.

659
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,563
These are the best actors in the world...

660
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:18,466
either for tragedy, comedy, history...

661
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:23,006
pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral...

662
01:04:24,476 --> 01:04:26,341
tragical-historical...

663
01:04:26,645 --> 01:04:29,273
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral.

664
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:34,410
For the law of writ and the liberty...

665
01:04:34,887 --> 01:04:37,549
these are the only men.

666
01:04:43,061 --> 01:04:45,859
My lord, you played once
for the university, you say?

667
01:04:45,931 --> 01:04:49,332
That did I, my lord,
and was accounted a good actor.

668
01:04:49,401 --> 01:04:51,130
What did you enact?

669
01:04:52,371 --> 01:04:54,635
I did enact Julius Caesar.

670
01:04:56,175 --> 01:04:59,167
I was killed in the Capitol.
Brutus killed me.

671
01:04:59,278 --> 01:05:02,714
It was a brute part of him
to kill so capital a calf there.

672
01:05:03,682 --> 01:05:05,616
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

673
01:05:05,684 --> 01:05:08,676
Excellent, in faith, of the chameleon's dish.

674
01:05:08,887 --> 01:05:11,515
I eat the air, promise-crammed.

675
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:15,187
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

676
01:05:17,396 --> 01:05:20,388
No, good mother,
here's metal more attractive.

677
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:25,669
- Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
- No, my lord.

678
01:05:26,238 --> 01:05:28,468
I mean, my head upon your lap?

679
01:05:30,876 --> 01:05:34,676
- Ay, my lord.
- Do you think I meant country matters?

680
01:05:36,915 --> 01:05:38,906
I think nothing, my lord.

681
01:05:39,084 --> 01:05:41,780
That's a fair thought
to lie between maids' legs.

682
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,947
- What is, my lord?
- Nothing.

683
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:49,319
- You are merry, my lord.
- Who, I?

684
01:05:49,394 --> 01:05:51,521
- Ay, my lord.
- Oh, God.

685
01:05:52,297 --> 01:05:54,822
What should a man do but be merry?

686
01:05:55,267 --> 01:05:57,861
For, look you,
how cheerfully my mother looks...

687
01:05:57,936 --> 01:06:00,564
and my father died within's two hours.

688
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:03,364
Nay, it is twice two months, my lord.

689
01:06:03,775 --> 01:06:04,969
So long?

690
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:09,606
O heavens, die two months ago,
and not forgotten yet?

691
01:06:10,649 --> 01:06:13,948
There's hope a great man's memory
may outlive his life half a year.

692
01:06:44,716 --> 01:06:49,312
Get thee to a nunnery.
Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?

693
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:57,388
I am myself indifferent honest,
but yet I could accuse me of such things...

694
01:06:57,462 --> 01:06:59,487
it were better
my mother had not borne me.

695
01:07:03,702 --> 01:07:08,332
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious,
with more offenses at my beck...

696
01:07:08,407 --> 01:07:11,774
than I have thoughts to put them in,
imagination to give them shape...

697
01:07:11,843 --> 01:07:13,743
or time to act them in.

698
01:07:15,847 --> 01:07:19,977
What should such fellows as I do
crawling between earth and heaven?

699
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,351
Believe none of us.

700
01:07:37,903 --> 01:07:40,701
For us, for our tragedy...

701
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:45,432
here stooping to your clemency...

702
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:50,311
we beg your hearing patiently.

703
01:07:54,252 --> 01:07:58,245
- Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
- Indeed, 'tis brief, my son.

704
01:07:58,323 --> 01:07:59,915
As woman's love.

705
01:08:13,939 --> 01:08:18,467
'Tis 30 years since Hymen
did our hands unite commutual...

706
01:08:18,543 --> 01:08:20,340
in most sacred bands.

707
01:08:25,384 --> 01:08:27,750
So many journeys
may the sun and moon...

708
01:08:27,819 --> 01:08:31,084
make us again count over
ere love be done.

709
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,793
But should I die before a new sun shine...

710
01:08:38,063 --> 01:08:40,759
you might another husband soon entwine.

711
01:08:41,066 --> 01:08:43,830
Nay, should you die...

712
01:08:44,369 --> 01:08:46,496
I should confound the rest!

713
01:08:46,972 --> 01:08:50,305
Such love must needs be treason
in my breast.

714
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:54,379
In second husband let me be accurst.

715
01:08:54,679 --> 01:08:58,445
None wed the second
but who killed the first.

716
01:09:00,419 --> 01:09:02,410
Wormwood.

717
01:09:02,487 --> 01:09:05,320
I do believe you think
what now you speak.

718
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:08,689
But what we do determine, oft we break.

719
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:12,428
This world is not for aye,
nor is it strange...

720
01:09:12,597 --> 01:09:17,125
that even our loves
should with our fortunes change.

721
01:09:28,013 --> 01:09:30,106
If she should break it now.

722
01:09:33,218 --> 01:09:37,655
Both here and hence
pursue me lasting strife...

723
01:09:38,356 --> 01:09:42,383
if, once a widow, ever I be wife.

724
01:09:43,595 --> 01:09:45,825
Madam, how like you this play?

725
01:09:46,031 --> 01:09:48,761
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.

726
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,527
- But she'll keep her word.
- Have you heard the argument?

727
01:09:53,538 --> 01:09:57,406
- Is there no offense in it?
- No, they do but jest...

728
01:09:57,843 --> 01:10:00,573
poison in jest. No offense in the world.

729
01:10:02,647 --> 01:10:05,548
- What do you call the play?
- <i>The Mousetrap</i>.

730
01:10:06,718 --> 01:10:09,448
'Tis a knavish piece of work,
but what of that?

731
01:10:09,521 --> 01:10:12,957
Your majesty and I have free souls,
it touches us not.

732
01:10:21,066 --> 01:10:23,864
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.

733
01:10:23,935 --> 01:10:27,632
- You are as good as a chorus, Cousin.
- His name is Gonzago.

734
01:10:31,776 --> 01:10:34,244
Wait, you shall see anon...

735
01:10:34,412 --> 01:10:37,575
how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

736
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:04,702
How fares my lord?

737
01:12:10,175 --> 01:12:11,767
Give me some...

738
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:15,511
Give me some light!

739
01:12:19,551 --> 01:12:21,815
Lights! Give over the play!

740
01:12:31,529 --> 01:12:34,464
What, frighted with false fire?

741
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,633
Why, let the stricken deer go weep!

742
01:12:43,408 --> 01:12:48,175
<i>Why, let the stricken deer go weep</i>

743
01:12:48,446 --> 01:12:51,210
<i>The hart ungalled play</i>

744
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:54,946
<i>For some must watch</i>
<i>while some must sleep</i>

745
01:12:55,186 --> 01:12:59,145
<i>Thus runs the world away</i>

746
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:01,682
O good Horatio...

747
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,729
I'll take the ghost's word
for a thousand pound. Didst perceive?

748
01:13:04,796 --> 01:13:06,787
- Very well.
- Upon the talk of the poisoning?

749
01:13:06,865 --> 01:13:08,594
I did very well...

750
01:13:11,536 --> 01:13:15,472
Believe none of us.
We are arrant knaves, all.

751
01:13:18,043 --> 01:13:20,477
To a nunnery, go. And quickly, too.

752
01:13:25,417 --> 01:13:26,611
Farewell.

753
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:38,226
Good my lord,
vouchsafe me a word with you.

754
01:13:38,296 --> 01:13:40,196
- Sir, a whole history.
- The King, sir.

755
01:13:40,265 --> 01:13:41,289
Ay, sir, what of him?

756
01:13:41,366 --> 01:13:43,197
Is in his retirement
marvelous distempered.

757
01:13:43,268 --> 01:13:46,533
- With drink, sir?
- No, my lord, rather with choler.

758
01:13:46,604 --> 01:13:50,096
Your wisdom should show itself
more richer to signify this to the doctor.

759
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:53,667
Put your discourse into some frame,
and make me a wholesome answer.

760
01:13:53,745 --> 01:13:55,804
- Sir, I cannot.
- What, my lord?

761
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,576
Make you a wholesome answer.
My wit's diseased.

762
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:01,778
- The Queen, your mother, sent us to you.
- You are welcome.

763
01:14:01,853 --> 01:14:04,219
Your behavior hath struck her
into amazement.

764
01:14:04,289 --> 01:14:07,087
O wonderful son,
that can so astonish a mother!

765
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:11,060
My lord, what is your cause of distemper?

766
01:14:11,563 --> 01:14:13,861
You do surely bar the door
upon your own liberty...

767
01:14:13,932 --> 01:14:16,628
if you deny your griefs to your friend.

768
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:20,831
Will you play upon this pipe?

769
01:14:21,673 --> 01:14:23,334
I cannot, my lord.

770
01:14:24,109 --> 01:14:27,169
I do beseech you.
Come, it is as easy as lying.

771
01:14:29,347 --> 01:14:31,144
I have not the skill.

772
01:14:32,283 --> 01:14:35,684
Why, look you now,
how unworthy a thing you make of me!

773
01:14:35,754 --> 01:14:37,119
You would play upon me.

774
01:14:37,188 --> 01:14:39,748
You would pluck out
the heart of my mystery...

775
01:14:39,824 --> 01:14:43,260
sound me from my lowest note
to the top of my compass.

776
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:48,057
God's blood, do you think
I am easier to be played on than a pipe?

777
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:54,461
I will come to my mother by and by.

778
01:14:54,939 --> 01:14:57,874
- We will say so.
- "By and by" is easily said.

779
01:15:09,053 --> 01:15:12,045
'Tis now the very witching time of night...

780
01:15:13,925 --> 01:15:15,825
when churchyards yawn...

781
01:15:15,894 --> 01:15:20,228
and hell itself
breathes out contagion to this world.

782
01:15:24,002 --> 01:15:27,096
Now could I drink hot blood...

783
01:15:28,306 --> 01:15:33,243
and do such bitter business
as the day would quake to look on.

784
01:15:37,081 --> 01:15:38,981
Soft, now to my mother.

785
01:15:40,618 --> 01:15:44,145
My offense is rank, it smells to heaven.

786
01:15:44,556 --> 01:15:47,354
It hath the primal eldest curse upon it.

787
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,289
A brother's murder.

788
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,938
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying.
And now I'll do it.

789
01:16:12,016 --> 01:16:15,383
And so he goes to heaven,
and so am I revenged.

790
01:16:16,254 --> 01:16:18,119
That would be scanned.

791
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:20,880
A villain kills my father.

792
01:16:20,959 --> 01:16:24,918
And for that I, his sole son,
do this same villain send to heaven...

793
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:29,065
when he is fit
and seasoned for his passage.

794
01:16:30,101 --> 01:16:33,264
Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge.

795
01:16:38,109 --> 01:16:39,770
O wretched state!

796
01:16:41,813 --> 01:16:44,475
O bosom black as death!

797
01:16:46,484 --> 01:16:49,851
No. When he is drunk asleep,
or in his rage...

798
01:16:49,921 --> 01:16:52,515
or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed...

799
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:55,457
then trip him,
that his heels may kick at heaven...

800
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:59,759
and that his soul may be as damned
and black as hell, whereto it goes.

801
01:17:00,765 --> 01:17:02,130
Now to my mother.

802
01:17:04,836 --> 01:17:08,795
'Tis meet that some more audience
than a mother should overhear.

803
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,209
- Mother!
- Withdraw, I hear him coming.

804
01:17:16,247 --> 01:17:17,407
Mother.

805
01:17:20,752 --> 01:17:23,550
- Pray you, be round with him.
- Fear me not.

806
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,200
Now, Mother, what's the matter?

807
01:17:37,268 --> 01:17:41,705
Hamlet, thou hast thy father
much offended.

808
01:17:42,674 --> 01:17:44,904
Mother, you have my father
much offended.

809
01:17:44,976 --> 01:17:48,104
Come, come,
you answer with an idle tongue.

810
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:50,113
Go, go,
you question with a wicked tongue.

811
01:17:50,181 --> 01:17:52,115
Why, how now, Hamlet?

812
01:17:53,318 --> 01:17:56,219
- What's the matter now?
- Have you forgot me?

813
01:17:56,321 --> 01:17:58,016
No, by the rood, not so.

814
01:17:58,089 --> 01:18:00,421
You are the Queen,
your husband's brother's wife.

815
01:18:00,491 --> 01:18:02,652
And, would it were not so,
you are my mother.

816
01:18:02,727 --> 01:18:05,423
Nay then, I'll set those to you
that can speak.

817
01:18:10,568 --> 01:18:11,592
Come.

818
01:18:11,869 --> 01:18:15,430
Come and sit you down.
You shall not budge.

819
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:19,700
You go not till I set you up a glass...

820
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:22,744
where you may see the inmost part of you.

821
01:18:22,847 --> 01:18:25,543
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me?

822
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:27,649
- Help!
- Help!

823
01:18:28,386 --> 01:18:31,014
How now! A rat? Dead, for a ducat!

824
01:18:32,991 --> 01:18:33,980
Dead!

825
01:18:34,425 --> 01:18:38,885
- O me, what hast thou done?
- Nay, I know not. Is it the king?

826
01:18:56,147 --> 01:18:59,480
What a rash and bloody deed is this!

827
01:19:00,084 --> 01:19:03,178
A bloody deed.
Almost as bad, good mother...

828
01:19:03,254 --> 01:19:05,688
as kill a king and marry with his brother.

829
01:19:05,757 --> 01:19:08,851
- As kill a king?
- Aye, lady, it was my word.

830
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:16,962
Thou wretched, rash,
intruding fool, farewell.

831
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:20,698
I took thee for thy better.

832
01:19:22,273 --> 01:19:23,968
Take thy fortune.

833
01:19:24,042 --> 01:19:26,875
Thou findest to be too busy
is some danger.

834
01:19:30,948 --> 01:19:33,143
Leave wringing of your hands.

835
01:19:35,787 --> 01:19:40,053
Peace, sit you down,
and let me wring your heart.

836
01:19:40,124 --> 01:19:44,584
For so I shall,
if it be made of penetrable stuff.

837
01:19:48,099 --> 01:19:51,830
What have I done, that thou darest wag
thy tongue in noise so rude against me?

838
01:19:51,903 --> 01:19:56,806
Such an act that blurs
the grace and blush of modesty...

839
01:19:57,408 --> 01:19:59,342
calls virtue hypocrite...

840
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:02,402
makes marriage vows
as false as dicers' oaths.

841
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,072
Ay me, what act?

842
01:20:12,523 --> 01:20:15,458
Look here, upon this picture, and on this.

843
01:20:16,461 --> 01:20:19,362
The counterfeit presentment
of two brothers.

844
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:26,058
See, what a grace
was seated on this brow.

845
01:20:27,038 --> 01:20:29,563
A combination and a form indeed...

846
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,905
where every god did seem to set his seal...

847
01:20:33,144 --> 01:20:35,738
to give the world assurance of a man.

848
01:20:37,482 --> 01:20:39,746
This was your husband.

849
01:20:40,518 --> 01:20:43,749
Look you now, what follows.
Here is your husband...

850
01:20:43,988 --> 01:20:47,253
like a mildewed ear,
blasting his wholesome brother.

851
01:20:47,325 --> 01:20:48,758
Have you eyes?

852
01:20:48,826 --> 01:20:52,091
Could you, on this fair mountain,
leave to feed...

853
01:20:52,163 --> 01:20:54,131
and batten on this moor?

854
01:20:55,099 --> 01:20:58,466
Have you eyes? You cannot call it love...

855
01:20:58,903 --> 01:21:01,770
for at your age,
the heyday in the blood is tame...

856
01:21:01,839 --> 01:21:04,672
it's humble, and waits upon the judgment.

857
01:21:04,742 --> 01:21:08,940
And what judgment would step
from this to this?

858
01:21:10,348 --> 01:21:14,011
Eyes without feeling,
feeling without sight.

859
01:21:14,552 --> 01:21:17,282
O shame, where is thy blush?

860
01:21:17,922 --> 01:21:19,412
Speak no more.

861
01:21:20,224 --> 01:21:23,022
Thou turnest my eyes into my very soul...

862
01:21:23,294 --> 01:21:27,253
and there I see such black and grained
spots as will not leave their tinct.

863
01:21:30,735 --> 01:21:34,899
Nay, but to live in the rank sweat...

864
01:21:34,972 --> 01:21:36,963
of an enseamed bed...

865
01:21:37,775 --> 01:21:39,766
stewed in corruption...

866
01:21:39,844 --> 01:21:44,679
honeying and making love
over the nasty sty.

867
01:21:44,749 --> 01:21:46,910
Speak to me no more.

868
01:21:46,984 --> 01:21:50,943
These words like daggers enter
in mine ears! No more, sweet Hamlet.

869
01:21:51,022 --> 01:21:53,855
- A murderer and a villain.
- No!

870
01:21:53,925 --> 01:21:56,826
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule.

871
01:21:57,595 --> 01:22:00,359
A king of shreds and patches...

872
01:22:17,748 --> 01:22:21,684
Save me, and hover over me
with your wings, you heavenly guards.

873
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:29,823
- What would your gracious figure?
- Alas, he's mad.

874
01:22:30,795 --> 01:22:33,787
Do you not come your tardy son to chide?

875
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:36,732
Oh, say.

876
01:22:38,069 --> 01:22:39,559
Do not forget.

877
01:22:42,607 --> 01:22:47,067
This visitation is but to whet
thy almost blunted purpose.

878
01:22:47,745 --> 01:22:49,144
But, look.

879
01:22:50,047 --> 01:22:52,413
Amazement on thy mother sits.

880
01:22:54,218 --> 01:22:57,449
Step between her and her fighting soul.

881
01:23:00,091 --> 01:23:02,116
Speak to her, Hamlet.

882
01:23:06,097 --> 01:23:07,621
How is it with you, lady?

883
01:23:07,698 --> 01:23:11,498
Alas, how is it with you,
that you do bend your eye on vacancy...

884
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:14,231
and with the incorporal air
do hold discourse?

885
01:23:14,505 --> 01:23:19,238
- O gentle son, say whereon do you look.
- On him. Look you, how pale he glares.

886
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:20,800
To whom do you speak this?

887
01:23:20,878 --> 01:23:25,212
- Do you see nothing there?
- Nothing at all. Yet all that is, I see.

888
01:23:25,283 --> 01:23:28,548
- Nor did you nothing hear?
- No, nothing but ourselves.

889
01:23:28,619 --> 01:23:30,985
Why, look you there!
Look how it steals away.

890
01:23:31,055 --> 01:23:35,219
- My father, in his habit as he lived.
- This is the very coinage of your brain!

891
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:39,229
It is not madness that I have uttered.

892
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:41,757
Mother, for love of grace...

893
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:45,164
lay not that flattering unction
to your soul...

894
01:23:45,503 --> 01:23:49,030
that not your trespass
but my madness speaks.

895
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:52,807
Confess yourself to heaven...

896
01:23:53,344 --> 01:23:56,177
repent what's past, avoid what is to come.

897
01:23:56,247 --> 01:23:59,648
And do not spread the compost
on the weeds...

898
01:23:59,717 --> 01:24:01,184
to make them ranker.

899
01:24:01,652 --> 01:24:03,051
O Hamlet...

900
01:24:04,322 --> 01:24:07,223
thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

901
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,320
Throw away the worser part of it...

902
01:24:12,396 --> 01:24:15,126
and live the purer with the other half.

903
01:24:23,574 --> 01:24:24,939
Good night.

904
01:24:29,613 --> 01:24:32,446
And when you are desirous to be blessed...

905
01:24:33,784 --> 01:24:35,775
I'll blessing beg of you.

906
01:24:41,258 --> 01:24:43,692
For this same lord, I do repent.

907
01:24:44,362 --> 01:24:48,526
But heaven hath pleased it so
to punish me with this, and this with me.

908
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:53,898
I will bestow him,
and will answer well the death I gave him.

909
01:24:54,705 --> 01:24:56,570
So, again, good night.

910
01:24:58,075 --> 01:25:00,669
I must be cruel only to be kind.

911
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:04,170
Thus bad begins
and worse remains behind.

912
01:25:05,983 --> 01:25:07,575
What shall I do?

913
01:25:07,985 --> 01:25:11,648
Let not the bloat King
tempt you again to bed...

914
01:25:12,957 --> 01:25:16,120
pinch wanton on your cheek,
call you his mouse.

915
01:25:17,194 --> 01:25:19,924
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses...

916
01:25:19,997 --> 01:25:23,262
or paddling in your neck
with his damned fingers...

917
01:25:23,334 --> 01:25:26,064
make you to ravel all this matter out...

918
01:25:26,203 --> 01:25:29,138
that I essentially am not in madness...

919
01:25:29,407 --> 01:25:31,034
but mad in craft.

920
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,141
Be thou assured...

921
01:25:38,249 --> 01:25:41,707
if words be made of breath,
and breath of life...

922
01:25:42,553 --> 01:25:45,852
I have no life to breathe
what thou hast said to me.

923
01:25:46,524 --> 01:25:48,549
Mother, good night, indeed.

924
01:25:59,136 --> 01:26:02,765
This counselor is now most still,
most secret...

925
01:26:03,274 --> 01:26:04,901
and most grave...

926
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:09,508
who was in life a foolish prating knave.

927
01:26:12,016 --> 01:26:14,814
Come, sir,
to draw toward an end with you.

928
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:17,482
Good night, Mother.

929
01:26:37,541 --> 01:26:38,803
Gertrude!

930
01:26:42,446 --> 01:26:43,572
Where is your son?

931
01:26:43,647 --> 01:26:46,275
Mine own lord, what have I seen tonight!

932
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:48,944
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

933
01:26:49,887 --> 01:26:51,047
Mad...

934
01:26:52,223 --> 01:26:55,624
as the sea and wind,
when both contend which is the mightier.

935
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,257
In his lawless fit...

936
01:26:58,596 --> 01:27:01,565
he hath killed the unseen good old man.

937
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:08,367
O heavy deed!

938
01:27:11,442 --> 01:27:13,933
It had been so with us, had we been there.

939
01:27:14,478 --> 01:27:16,343
Guards!

940
01:27:17,681 --> 01:27:20,775
Friends, go join you with some further aid.

941
01:27:21,018 --> 01:27:24,112
Hamlet, in madness, hath Polonius slain.

942
01:27:24,355 --> 01:27:26,721
- My lord Hamlet!
- Search over there!

943
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:28,781
- My lord Hamlet!
- Hamlet!

944
01:27:31,195 --> 01:27:32,662
- Look in there!
- Over there!

945
01:27:33,397 --> 01:27:36,025
I have sent to seek him
and to find the body.

946
01:27:36,267 --> 01:27:39,930
Yet, sirs, we must not put
the strong law on him.

947
01:27:40,271 --> 01:27:42,739
He's loved of the distracted multitude.

948
01:27:44,341 --> 01:27:46,070
How now! What hath befallen?

949
01:27:46,143 --> 01:27:49,374
Where the dead body is bestowed,
my lord, we could not get from him.

950
01:27:49,446 --> 01:27:50,811
But where is he?

951
01:27:55,119 --> 01:27:56,643
Now, Hamlet...

952
01:27:58,589 --> 01:28:00,216
where's Polonius?

953
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:02,289
At supper.

954
01:28:04,128 --> 01:28:05,459
At supper?

955
01:28:07,898 --> 01:28:11,629
- Where?
- Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.

956
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:15,661
A certain convocation of politic worms
are e'en at him.

957
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:17,832
Alas.

958
01:28:19,577 --> 01:28:23,035
A man may fish
with the worm that hath eat of a king...

959
01:28:23,948 --> 01:28:26,781
and eat of the fish that fed of that worm.

960
01:28:27,685 --> 01:28:30,415
- What dost thou mean by this?
- Nothing...

961
01:28:31,188 --> 01:28:35,181
but to show you how a king may go
a progress through the guts of a beggar.

962
01:28:40,731 --> 01:28:42,756
Where is Polonius?

963
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:45,532
In heaven. Send thither to see.

964
01:28:45,869 --> 01:28:49,930
If your messenger find him not there,
seek him in the other place yourself.

965
01:28:52,643 --> 01:28:55,237
But if, indeed, you find him not
within this month...

966
01:28:55,312 --> 01:28:58,509
you shall nose him as you go up the stairs
into the lobby.

967
01:28:58,582 --> 01:29:01,016
- Go seek him there.
- He will stay till you come.

968
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:05,215
Hamlet, this deed, for thine
especial safety, must send thee hence.

969
01:29:05,289 --> 01:29:07,484
Therefore prepare thyself for England.

970
01:29:07,558 --> 01:29:08,991
- For England?
- Ay, Hamlet.

971
01:29:09,059 --> 01:29:12,620
- Good.
- So is it, if thou knewest our purposes.

972
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:16,126
I see a cherub that sees them.

973
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:20,063
But, come. For England!
Farewell, dear mother.

974
01:29:20,738 --> 01:29:23,571
- Thy loving father, Hamlet.
- My mother.

975
01:29:24,842 --> 01:29:27,902
Father and mother is man and wife,
man and wife is one flesh...

976
01:29:27,978 --> 01:29:30,538
and so, my mother.

977
01:29:31,749 --> 01:29:33,410
Come, for England.

978
01:29:38,355 --> 01:29:41,654
I'll have him hence tonight.
Therefore, prepare you.

979
01:29:44,261 --> 01:29:48,129
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
and he to England shall along with you.

980
01:29:48,198 --> 01:29:51,565
Arm you, I pray you,
to this speedy voyage.

981
01:29:56,040 --> 01:30:00,067
And, England, if my love
thou holdest at aught...

982
01:30:00,577 --> 01:30:02,875
thou mayest not stop our process...

983
01:30:02,946 --> 01:30:07,178
which imports by letters
that these worthy men must bear...

984
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:13,086
the present death of Hamlet.
Do it, England.

985
01:30:20,864 --> 01:30:22,092
My lord!

986
01:30:27,304 --> 01:30:30,330
- I must to England. You know that?
- Alas.

987
01:30:30,407 --> 01:30:32,034
There's letters sealed.

988
01:30:32,109 --> 01:30:36,842
And my two schoolfellows,
whom I will trust as I will adders fanged...

989
01:30:38,015 --> 01:30:39,607
they bear the mandate.

990
01:30:39,683 --> 01:30:42,379
They must sweep my way
and marshal me to knavery.

991
01:30:42,453 --> 01:30:43,943
Let it work...

992
01:30:45,055 --> 01:30:48,047
for I will delve one yard
below their mines...

993
01:30:48,325 --> 01:30:50,350
and blow them at the moon.

994
01:32:17,147 --> 01:32:20,207
How should I your true love know
from another one?

995
01:32:23,687 --> 01:32:27,646
<i>By his cockle hat and staff</i>
<i>and his sandal shoon</i>

996
01:32:51,381 --> 01:32:55,147
Young men will do it, if they come to it.
By cock they are to blame.

997
01:32:55,252 --> 01:32:58,551
<i>Quoth she, "Before you tumbled me</i>
<i>you promised me to wed"</i>

998
01:32:58,922 --> 01:33:03,359
<i>"So would I ha ' done, by yonder sun</i>
<i>an thou hadst not come to my bed"</i>

999
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:05,423
Come, my lady.

1000
01:33:16,006 --> 01:33:19,669
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is...

1001
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:23,345
each toy seems prologue
to some great amiss.

1002
01:33:25,015 --> 01:33:27,711
So full of artless jealousy is guilt...

1003
01:33:27,885 --> 01:33:30,683
it spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

1004
01:33:31,021 --> 01:33:33,854
Where is the beauteous majesty
of Denmark?

1005
01:33:41,164 --> 01:33:42,654
Where is the...

1006
01:33:44,101 --> 01:33:45,728
How now, Ophelia?

1007
01:33:55,479 --> 01:33:58,448
<i>He is dead and gone, lady</i>

1008
01:33:59,516 --> 01:34:01,814
<i>He is dead and gone</i>

1009
01:34:03,587 --> 01:34:06,784
<i>At his head a grass-green turf</i>

1010
01:34:07,724 --> 01:34:10,659
<i>At his heels a stone</i>

1011
01:34:34,151 --> 01:34:36,244
How long has she been thus?

1012
01:34:43,026 --> 01:34:44,721
How do you, pretty lady?

1013
01:34:46,897 --> 01:34:48,626
Well, God 'ild you!

1014
01:34:54,037 --> 01:34:56,767
They say the owl was a baker's daughter.

1015
01:34:57,574 --> 01:35:01,601
Lord, we know what we are,
but not what we may be.

1016
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:07,417
I hope all will be well.

1017
01:35:09,653 --> 01:35:11,382
We must be patient.

1018
01:35:27,437 --> 01:35:29,735
But I cannot choose but weep...

1019
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:33,600
to think they would lay him
in the cold ground.

1020
01:35:51,161 --> 01:35:53,288
My brother shall know of it.

1021
01:35:57,434 --> 01:36:00,460
And so I thank you for your good counsel.

1022
01:36:06,276 --> 01:36:07,800
Come, my coach.

1023
01:36:11,782 --> 01:36:13,306
Poor Ophelia...

1024
01:36:14,184 --> 01:36:17,017
divided from herself and her fair judgment.

1025
01:36:18,321 --> 01:36:20,289
Good night, ladies.

1026
01:36:21,892 --> 01:36:24,986
Sweet ladies, good night.

1027
01:36:25,996 --> 01:36:27,588
Follow her close.

1028
01:36:29,499 --> 01:36:31,865
Give her good watch, I pray you.

1029
01:36:33,403 --> 01:36:37,635
<i>Quoth she, "Before you tumbled me</i>
<i>you promised me to wed"</i>

1030
01:36:38,108 --> 01:36:39,234
<i>He answers</i>

1031
01:36:39,509 --> 01:36:42,205
<i>"So would I ha ' done, by yonder sun</i>

1032
01:36:43,046 --> 01:36:44,911
<i>"An thou hadst not come to my bed"</i>

1033
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:55,421
O Gertrude...

1034
01:36:57,961 --> 01:37:01,192
when sorrows come,
they come not single spies...

1035
01:37:01,264 --> 01:37:03,664
but in battalions.

1036
01:37:03,867 --> 01:37:06,062
No!

1037
01:37:14,978 --> 01:37:16,206
My lady.

1038
01:38:16,807 --> 01:38:20,038
<i>"By letters that these worthy men</i>
<i>must bear...</i>

1039
01:38:20,110 --> 01:38:23,136
<i>"the present death of Hamlet.</i>

1040
01:38:24,314 --> 01:38:26,077
<i>"Do it, England."</i>

1041
01:38:43,567 --> 01:38:44,625
No!

1042
01:39:19,202 --> 01:39:20,931
Where is this king?

1043
01:39:21,771 --> 01:39:24,205
Let him stand before me!

1044
01:39:27,978 --> 01:39:29,206
Where is the King?

1045
01:39:29,279 --> 01:39:32,112
- Stay, my lord Laertes.
- Hold him back!

1046
01:39:33,984 --> 01:39:36,782
O thou vile king, give me my father!

1047
01:39:36,853 --> 01:39:38,343
Calmly, good Laertes!

1048
01:39:39,289 --> 01:39:40,483
Let him go...

1049
01:39:41,858 --> 01:39:43,689
and do not fear our person.

1050
01:39:43,927 --> 01:39:45,451
Where is my father?

1051
01:39:48,865 --> 01:39:51,925
- Dead.
- Let come what comes...

1052
01:39:52,002 --> 01:39:54,869
only I'll be revenged most throughly
for my father.

1053
01:39:54,938 --> 01:39:56,530
Good Laertes...

1054
01:39:57,674 --> 01:40:00,905
if you desire to know
the certainty of your dear father...

1055
01:40:02,412 --> 01:40:03,902
is it writ in your revenge...

1056
01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:06,312
that you will draw
against both friend and foe?

1057
01:40:06,383 --> 01:40:08,112
None but his enemies.

1058
01:40:08,184 --> 01:40:11,312
Why, now you speak...

1059
01:40:11,788 --> 01:40:14,689
like a good child and a true gentleman.

1060
01:40:27,704 --> 01:40:30,696
That I am guiltless of your father's death...

1061
01:40:31,207 --> 01:40:34,267
and am most sensibly in grief for it...

1062
01:40:39,716 --> 01:40:44,085
it shall as level to your judgment appear
as day does to your eye.

1063
01:41:19,689 --> 01:41:22,522
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance.

1064
01:41:34,871 --> 01:41:36,862
Pray you, love, remember.

1065
01:41:42,345 --> 01:41:45,178
And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.

1066
01:41:56,659 --> 01:41:59,890
There's fennel for you, and columbines.

1067
01:42:05,635 --> 01:42:08,627
There's rue for you,
and here's some for me.

1068
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:13,566
You must wear your rue with a difference.

1069
01:42:16,012 --> 01:42:17,604
There's a daisy.

1070
01:42:19,115 --> 01:42:22,812
I'd give you some violets,
but they withered all when my father died.

1071
01:42:22,886 --> 01:42:25,047
They say he made a good end.

1072
01:42:34,931 --> 01:42:38,389
O heavens,
is it possible a young maid's wits...

1073
01:42:38,802 --> 01:42:41,600
should be as mortal as an old man's life?

1074
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,793
<i>There is a willow grows aslant the brook...</i>

1075
01:43:07,230 --> 01:43:10,358
<i>that shows his hoar leaves</i>
<i>in the glassy stream.</i>

1076
01:43:11,801 --> 01:43:14,361
<i>There with fantastic garlands</i>
<i>did she make...</i>

1077
01:43:15,105 --> 01:43:19,667
<i>of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies,</i>
<i>and long purples.</i>

1078
01:43:21,678 --> 01:43:23,441
There, on the pendent boughs...

1079
01:43:23,513 --> 01:43:26,209
her crownet weeds clambering to hang...

1080
01:43:27,283 --> 01:43:29,376
an envious sliver broke...

1081
01:43:31,254 --> 01:43:34,052
when down her weedy trophies
and herself...

1082
01:43:34,691 --> 01:43:36,750
fell in the weeping brook.

1083
01:43:38,461 --> 01:43:41,362
Her clothes spread wide...

1084
01:43:43,166 --> 01:43:46,135
and mermaid-like,
awhile they bore her up...

1085
01:43:47,103 --> 01:43:50,334
which time she chanted
snatches of old tunes...

1086
01:43:52,775 --> 01:43:55,471
as one incapable of her own distress...

1087
01:43:56,746 --> 01:44:00,409
or like a creature native
and indued unto that element.

1088
01:44:02,118 --> 01:44:04,211
But long it could not be...

1089
01:44:04,988 --> 01:44:08,151
but that her garments,
heavy with their drink...

1090
01:44:08,992 --> 01:44:12,155
pulled the poor wretch
from her melodious lay...

1091
01:44:13,296 --> 01:44:14,729
to muddy death.

1092
01:44:17,867 --> 01:44:19,858
<i>Alas! Then she is drowned?</i>

1093
01:44:21,371 --> 01:44:22,633
<i>Drowned.</i>

1094
01:44:39,689 --> 01:44:42,214
<i>Methought it was very sweet</i>

1095
01:44:43,526 --> 01:44:47,155
<i>To contract the time for my behove</i>

1096
01:44:48,364 --> 01:44:51,663
<i>Methought there was nothing a-meet</i>

1097
01:44:53,736 --> 01:44:57,570
<i>But age, with his stealing steps</i>

1098
01:44:59,509 --> 01:45:02,672
<i>Hath clawed me in his clutch</i>

1099
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:06,177
Whose grave's this, sirrah?

1100
01:45:07,617 --> 01:45:08,982
Mine, sir.

1101
01:45:09,819 --> 01:45:12,652
I think it be thine indeed,
for thou liest in it.

1102
01:45:14,524 --> 01:45:17,687
- What man dost thou dig it for?
- For no man, sir.

1103
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,456
- What woman, then?
- For none, neither.

1104
01:45:24,067 --> 01:45:26,092
Who is to be buried in it?

1105
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:31,401
One that was a woman, sir.
But, rest her soul, she's dead.

1106
01:45:32,342 --> 01:45:34,401
How absolute the knave is.

1107
01:45:37,814 --> 01:45:39,975
How long hast thou been grave-maker?

1108
01:45:40,516 --> 01:45:42,882
Since that very day
that young Hamlet was born.

1109
01:45:42,952 --> 01:45:44,886
He that is mad and sent into England.

1110
01:45:44,954 --> 01:45:48,219
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?

1111
01:45:48,958 --> 01:45:52,223
Why, because he was mad.
He shall recover his wits there.

1112
01:45:53,263 --> 01:45:55,823
Or, if he do not, 'tis no great matter there.

1113
01:45:56,032 --> 01:45:58,432
- Why?
- 'Twill not be seen in him there.

1114
01:45:58,701 --> 01:46:00,999
There the men are as mad as he.

1115
01:46:06,109 --> 01:46:08,839
How long will a man lie in the earth
ere he rot?

1116
01:46:09,012 --> 01:46:12,880
Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,
some eight year, nine year.

1117
01:46:14,951 --> 01:46:16,475
Here's a skull now...

1118
01:46:17,153 --> 01:46:20,213
hath lain you in the earth
some three-and-twenty years.

1119
01:46:20,356 --> 01:46:21,721
Whose was it?

1120
01:46:22,558 --> 01:46:24,651
A whoreson mad fellow's it was.

1121
01:46:25,128 --> 01:46:27,722
He poured a flagon of Rhenish
on my head once.

1122
01:46:27,797 --> 01:46:30,391
- Whose do you think it was?
- Nay, I know not.

1123
01:46:31,067 --> 01:46:34,332
This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull...

1124
01:46:35,104 --> 01:46:36,765
the King's jester.

1125
01:46:37,407 --> 01:46:39,102
- This?
- E'en that.

1126
01:46:39,642 --> 01:46:41,007
Let me see.

1127
01:46:48,217 --> 01:46:49,912
Alas, poor Yorick.

1128
01:46:52,455 --> 01:46:54,218
I knew him, Horatio...

1129
01:46:54,791 --> 01:46:58,124
a fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy.

1130
01:47:06,402 --> 01:47:09,496
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times.

1131
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:14,942
And now,
how abhorred in my imagination it is.

1132
01:47:16,612 --> 01:47:18,603
My gorge rises at it.

1133
01:47:20,783 --> 01:47:25,379
Here hung those lips that I have kissed
I know not how oft.

1134
01:47:28,124 --> 01:47:30,092
Where be your gibes now?

1135
01:47:31,828 --> 01:47:35,821
Your gambols, your songs,
your flashes of merriment...

1136
01:47:35,898 --> 01:47:38,492
that were wont to set the table on a roar?

1137
01:47:43,206 --> 01:47:45,504
Not one now, to mock your own grinning?

1138
01:47:47,844 --> 01:47:49,471
Quite chopfallen?

1139
01:47:52,315 --> 01:47:55,807
Now get you to my lady's chamber...

1140
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:58,584
and tell her...

1141
01:47:58,654 --> 01:48:01,122
let her paint an inch thick...

1142
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:05,486
to this favor she must come.

1143
01:48:08,765 --> 01:48:10,665
Make her laugh at that.

1144
01:48:28,284 --> 01:48:31,447
The King, the courtiers.

1145
01:48:37,693 --> 01:48:39,661
Who is this they follow?

1146
01:48:52,175 --> 01:48:54,075
Lay her in the earth.

1147
01:48:56,078 --> 01:49:00,276
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
may violets spring.

1148
01:49:09,358 --> 01:49:11,121
Sweets to the sweet.

1149
01:49:15,398 --> 01:49:16,695
Farewell.

1150
01:49:21,571 --> 01:49:24,369
I hoped thou shouldst have been
my Hamlet's wife.

1151
01:49:25,241 --> 01:49:28,233
I thought thy bride-bed to have decked,
sweet maid...

1152
01:49:28,978 --> 01:49:31,310
and not to have strewed thy grave.

1153
01:49:39,288 --> 01:49:42,849
Hold off the earth awhile, till I have
caught her once more in mine arms.

1154
01:49:42,925 --> 01:49:44,552
O rose of May...

1155
01:49:46,295 --> 01:49:47,728
dear maid...

1156
01:49:48,965 --> 01:49:50,660
kind sister.

1157
01:50:04,814 --> 01:50:06,782
The devil take thy soul!

1158
01:50:06,849 --> 01:50:09,477
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat...

1159
01:50:09,886 --> 01:50:12,184
for I have in me something dangerous...

1160
01:50:12,255 --> 01:50:15,349
which let thy wiseness fear.
Hold off thy hand!

1161
01:50:15,458 --> 01:50:16,891
Pluck them asunder!

1162
01:50:18,628 --> 01:50:20,289
Good my lord, be quiet.

1163
01:50:20,563 --> 01:50:22,497
I loved Ophelia.

1164
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:26,364
Forty thousand brothers could not...

1165
01:50:26,435 --> 01:50:28,596
with all their quantity of love...

1166
01:50:28,671 --> 01:50:30,229
make up my sum.

1167
01:50:32,441 --> 01:50:34,170
What wilt thou do for her?

1168
01:50:34,777 --> 01:50:36,836
'Swounds, show me what thou wilt do!

1169
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:47,583
Hear you, sir, I loved you ever.

1170
01:50:50,626 --> 01:50:52,423
But it is no matter.

1171
01:50:53,963 --> 01:50:57,194
Let Hercules himself do what he may...

1172
01:50:58,434 --> 01:51:01,835
the cat will mew
and dog will have his day.

1173
01:51:26,195 --> 01:51:29,028
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.

1174
01:51:40,676 --> 01:51:42,303
Will you be ruled by me?

1175
01:51:42,378 --> 01:51:45,404
I will, my lord,
so you will not overrule me to a peace.

1176
01:51:45,481 --> 01:51:47,210
To thine own peace.

1177
01:51:47,783 --> 01:51:48,977
But tell me, sir...

1178
01:51:49,051 --> 01:51:52,418
why you proceeded not against
these crimes so capital in nature?

1179
01:51:52,488 --> 01:51:54,513
For two especial reasons:

1180
01:51:54,857 --> 01:51:58,293
The Queen his mother
lives almost by his looks.

1181
01:51:59,762 --> 01:52:01,423
And for myself.

1182
01:52:02,264 --> 01:52:04,824
My virtue or my plague,
be it either which...

1183
01:52:06,102 --> 01:52:08,593
she is so conjunctive to my life and soul...

1184
01:52:08,671 --> 01:52:12,072
that, as the star moves
not but in his sphere...

1185
01:52:13,376 --> 01:52:15,537
I could not but by her.

1186
01:52:20,850 --> 01:52:24,752
The other motive is the great love
the general gender bear him.

1187
01:52:26,555 --> 01:52:30,719
Laertes, was your father dear to you?

1188
01:52:31,894 --> 01:52:35,557
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
a face without a heart?

1189
01:52:35,631 --> 01:52:36,791
Why ask you this?

1190
01:52:36,866 --> 01:52:40,529
Not that I think
you did not love your father. But, Laertes...

1191
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:45,503
what would you undertake
to show yourself your father's son...

1192
01:52:45,574 --> 01:52:48,134
in deed more than in words?

1193
01:52:51,547 --> 01:52:54,345
To cut his throat in the church.

1194
01:52:58,421 --> 01:53:00,855
Revenge should have no bounds.

1195
01:53:03,059 --> 01:53:04,788
That we would do...

1196
01:53:05,828 --> 01:53:07,921
we should do when we would.

1197
01:53:11,734 --> 01:53:13,668
I'll work the prince...

1198
01:53:14,804 --> 01:53:19,764
to an exploit now ripe in my device,
under the which he cannot choose but fall.

1199
01:53:20,376 --> 01:53:22,173
And for his death...

1200
01:53:24,847 --> 01:53:26,974
no wind of blame shall breathe...

1201
01:53:27,049 --> 01:53:30,576
but even his mother
shall uncharge the practice...

1202
01:53:31,687 --> 01:53:33,484
and call it accident.

1203
01:53:35,991 --> 01:53:37,390
Lord Hamlet!

1204
01:53:47,603 --> 01:53:50,299
Your lordship is right welcome
back to Denmark.

1205
01:53:50,506 --> 01:53:52,497
I humbly thank you, sir.

1206
01:53:52,942 --> 01:53:55,308
Sweet lord,
if your lordship were at leisure...

1207
01:53:55,377 --> 01:53:57,811
I should impart a thing to you
from His Majesty.

1208
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:00,781
I will receive it, sir,
will all diligence of spirit.

1209
01:54:00,850 --> 01:54:04,183
Put your bonnet to his right use.
'Tis for the head.

1210
01:54:04,754 --> 01:54:07,052
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.

1211
01:54:07,123 --> 01:54:10,559
No, believe me, it is very cold.
The wind is northerly.

1212
01:54:11,026 --> 01:54:13,586
My lord, His Majesty bade me tell you...

1213
01:54:13,662 --> 01:54:16,222
that he has laid a great wager
on your head.

1214
01:54:16,532 --> 01:54:19,626
Laertes, believe me,
is an absolute gentleman.

1215
01:54:19,702 --> 01:54:22,796
I well know
you are not ignorant of his skills.

1216
01:54:23,439 --> 01:54:25,839
To know a man well were to know himself.

1217
01:54:26,942 --> 01:54:30,139
The king hath wagered
six Barbary horses...

1218
01:54:30,412 --> 01:54:32,380
that in a dozen passes between you...

1219
01:54:32,448 --> 01:54:34,939
he shall not exceed you three hits.

1220
01:54:35,017 --> 01:54:37,178
It would come
to immediate trial tomorrow...

1221
01:54:37,253 --> 01:54:40,086
if your lordship would vouchsafe
a timely answer.

1222
01:54:40,990 --> 01:54:43,254
I will win for him, if I can.

1223
01:54:44,059 --> 01:54:46,960
If not, I gain nothing but my shame
and the odd hits.

1224
01:54:47,029 --> 01:54:49,156
Shall I deliver you even so?

1225
01:54:50,232 --> 01:54:52,928
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready...

1226
01:54:53,736 --> 01:54:58,002
now or whensoever,
provided I be so able as now.

1227
01:55:16,192 --> 01:55:19,161
- You will lose this wager, my lord.
- I do not think so.

1228
01:55:19,228 --> 01:55:22,925
I have been in continual practice.
I shall win at the odds.

1229
01:55:24,266 --> 01:55:27,565
Thou wouldst not think
how ill all's here about my heart.

1230
01:55:31,273 --> 01:55:33,070
But it is no matter.

1231
01:55:33,909 --> 01:55:36,605
If your mind dislike anything, obey it.

1232
01:55:36,812 --> 01:55:39,872
Not a whit. We defy augury.

1233
01:55:42,351 --> 01:55:43,716
I have it.

1234
01:55:44,787 --> 01:55:47,654
When in your motion you are hot and dry...

1235
01:55:49,124 --> 01:55:51,991
I'll have a chalice, which if he but sip...

1236
01:55:52,161 --> 01:55:54,254
our purpose may hold there.

1237
01:55:54,396 --> 01:55:56,830
For that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.

1238
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,059
I bought an unction of a mountebank...

1239
01:56:00,135 --> 01:56:04,162
so mortal that, if I but scratch him,
it will mean death.

1240
01:56:07,576 --> 01:56:11,307
It warms the very sickness in my heart
that I shall tell him to his teeth:

1241
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:13,075
"Thus diest thou."

1242
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:28,059
There is special providence
in the fall of a sparrow.

1243
01:56:30,366 --> 01:56:32,561
If it be now, it is not to come.

1244
01:56:34,169 --> 01:56:36,433
If it be not to come, it will be now.

1245
01:56:38,674 --> 01:56:41,507
If it be not now, yet it will come.

1246
01:56:52,121 --> 01:56:53,918
The readiness is all.

1247
01:58:06,528 --> 01:58:07,927
All salute!

1248
01:58:12,601 --> 01:58:16,298
Come, Hamlet, come,
and take this hand from me.

1249
01:58:21,010 --> 01:58:23,911
Give me your pardon, sir.
I have done you wrong...

1250
01:58:24,747 --> 01:58:27,307
but pardon it, as you are a gentleman.

1251
01:58:27,383 --> 01:58:29,351
Sir, in this audience...

1252
01:58:29,551 --> 01:58:32,645
free me so far
in your most generous thoughts...

1253
01:58:33,022 --> 01:58:36,719
that I have shot my arrow over the house
and hurt my brother.

1254
01:58:37,059 --> 01:58:38,651
I am satisfied in nature...

1255
01:58:38,727 --> 01:58:41,389
but in terms of honor, I stand aloof...

1256
01:58:41,463 --> 01:58:43,488
and will no reconcilement.

1257
01:58:46,735 --> 01:58:49,636
Yet I receive your offered love like love...

1258
01:58:49,705 --> 01:58:51,297
and will not wrong it.

1259
01:58:52,241 --> 01:58:54,106
I embrace it freely...

1260
01:58:54,810 --> 01:58:57,643
and will this brother's wager frankly play.

1261
01:58:58,213 --> 01:58:59,874
Give us the sword!

1262
01:59:02,484 --> 01:59:03,815
Come, one for me.

1263
01:59:04,319 --> 01:59:07,584
- Cousin Hamlet, you know the wager?
- Very well, my lord.

1264
01:59:07,656 --> 01:59:10,147
Your Grace has laid the odds
on the weaker side.

1265
01:59:10,225 --> 01:59:13,058
I do not fear it. I have seen you both.

1266
01:59:13,128 --> 01:59:15,926
Set me the stoup of wine upon that table.

1267
01:59:16,065 --> 01:59:18,625
If Hamlet give the first or second hit...

1268
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:22,158
the King shall drink
to Hamlet's better breath.

1269
01:59:22,805 --> 01:59:27,299
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
the trumpet to the cannoneer without...

1270
01:59:27,376 --> 01:59:30,868
the cannons to the heavens,
the heaven to earth:

1271
01:59:31,113 --> 01:59:35,015
"Now the King drinks to Hamlet!"

1272
02:00:18,227 --> 02:00:19,660
What's wrong, Laertes?

1273
02:00:27,402 --> 02:00:28,494
Higher, Laertes!

1274
02:00:41,416 --> 02:00:43,509
Go to it, Laertes!

1275
02:00:53,762 --> 02:00:55,354
- One!
- No!

1276
02:00:56,365 --> 02:00:59,061
- A hit, a very palpable hit.
- Well, again!

1277
02:00:59,968 --> 02:01:01,060
Stay.

1278
02:01:05,807 --> 02:01:07,638
Give me drink.

1279
02:01:08,477 --> 02:01:09,774
Hamlet...

1280
02:01:10,679 --> 02:01:13,375
this pearl is thine.

1281
02:01:14,683 --> 02:01:16,480
Here's to thy health!

1282
02:01:28,597 --> 02:01:31,623
I'll play this bout first. Set it by a while.

1283
02:02:27,689 --> 02:02:29,122
Stay!

1284
02:02:57,019 --> 02:03:00,147
- Another hit! What say you?
- A touch, I do confess.

1285
02:03:00,956 --> 02:03:04,323
- Our son shall win.
- He's scant of breath.

1286
02:03:05,927 --> 02:03:09,260
The queen carouses
to thy fortune, Hamlet.

1287
02:03:09,331 --> 02:03:12,528
Gertrude, do not drink.

1288
02:03:13,802 --> 02:03:16,430
I will, my lord, I pray you pardon me.

1289
02:03:25,347 --> 02:03:27,872
I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.

1290
02:03:28,684 --> 02:03:30,777
Come, let me wipe thy face.

1291
02:04:06,054 --> 02:04:07,715
This is too heavy.

1292
02:04:24,606 --> 02:04:26,972
Come for the third, Laertes.
You do but dally.

1293
02:04:27,042 --> 02:04:29,237
Say you so? Come on!

1294
02:04:35,817 --> 02:04:37,614
Laertes, you have practiced much.

1295
02:04:48,029 --> 02:04:49,428
Parry again, lord.

1296
02:05:08,917 --> 02:05:10,407
Come, my lord!

1297
02:05:22,164 --> 02:05:23,426
My lord Hamlet!

1298
02:05:34,443 --> 02:05:36,206
Break it!

1299
02:05:36,545 --> 02:05:39,878
Nothing, neither way. Part, sirs!

1300
02:06:08,076 --> 02:06:09,338
'Tis unfair!

1301
02:06:16,218 --> 02:06:17,708
Nay, come again!

1302
02:06:27,662 --> 02:06:29,129
Fight, Laertes!

1303
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:34,834
Look to the Queen there! Ho!

1304
02:06:35,170 --> 02:06:37,195
They bleed on both sides.

1305
02:06:43,311 --> 02:06:45,302
- How does my lord?
- How does the Queen?

1306
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:47,610
She swoons to see them bleed!

1307
02:06:49,885 --> 02:06:50,977
No!

1308
02:06:53,088 --> 02:06:54,419
The drink.

1309
02:07:01,296 --> 02:07:03,093
O my dear Hamlet...

1310
02:07:27,455 --> 02:07:29,218
O villainy!

1311
02:07:29,624 --> 02:07:31,956
Ho! Let the doors be locked!

1312
02:07:32,227 --> 02:07:33,888
Treachery! Seek it out.

1313
02:07:33,962 --> 02:07:35,395
It is here, Hamlet.

1314
02:07:35,864 --> 02:07:37,593
Hamlet, thou art slain.

1315
02:07:37,666 --> 02:07:40,100
No medicine in the world
can do thee good.

1316
02:07:41,303 --> 02:07:43,464
The treacherous instrument
is in thy hand...

1317
02:07:43,538 --> 02:07:45,438
unbated and envenomed.

1318
02:07:46,608 --> 02:07:49,133
The foul practice hath turned itself on me.

1319
02:07:49,644 --> 02:07:52,579
I am justly killed with mine own treachery.

1320
02:07:53,248 --> 02:07:56,046
Exchange forgiveness with me,
noble Hamlet.

1321
02:07:56,484 --> 02:07:58,782
Mine and my father's death
come not upon thee.

1322
02:07:58,853 --> 02:08:00,184
Nor mine on thee.

1323
02:08:00,655 --> 02:08:02,350
I can no more!

1324
02:08:08,597 --> 02:08:09,723
The King...

1325
02:08:09,864 --> 02:08:11,525
The King's to blame.

1326
02:08:19,541 --> 02:08:21,236
The point envenomed.

1327
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:28,342
Then, venom, to thy work!

1328
02:08:33,855 --> 02:08:36,915
Yet defend me, friends.

1329
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:46,730
Here, thou incestuous, murderous,
damned Dane...

1330
02:08:47,268 --> 02:08:49,099
drink of this potion.

1331
02:08:50,038 --> 02:08:53,132
Is thy union here? Follow my mother!

1332
02:09:16,431 --> 02:09:18,194
I am dead, Horatio.

1333
02:09:32,047 --> 02:09:33,605
Wretched queen...

1334
02:09:35,016 --> 02:09:36,176
adieu.

1335
02:09:49,698 --> 02:09:53,657
You that look pale
and tremble at this chance:

1336
02:09:54,202 --> 02:09:56,193
Had I but time...

1337
02:09:56,705 --> 02:10:01,108
as this fell sergeant, death,
is strict in his arrest...

1338
02:10:03,645 --> 02:10:05,545
I could tell you...

1339
02:10:06,948 --> 02:10:08,438
But let it be.

1340
02:10:14,522 --> 02:10:16,285
Horatio, I am dead.

1341
02:10:18,727 --> 02:10:22,163
Thou livest.
Report me and my cause aright.

1342
02:10:24,532 --> 02:10:27,558
God, Horatio, what a wounded name...

1343
02:10:27,902 --> 02:10:30,871
things standing thus unknown,
shall live behind me.

1344
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:35,507
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart...

1345
02:10:38,980 --> 02:10:41,278
absent thee from felicity awhile...

1346
02:10:41,349 --> 02:10:45,547
and then in this harsh world
draw thy breath in pain...

1347
02:10:46,588 --> 02:10:48,249
to tell my story.

1348
02:10:53,328 --> 02:10:54,989
I die, Horatio.

1349
02:10:58,666 --> 02:11:02,033
The potent poison
quite o'er-crows my spirit.

1350
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:09,476
The rest is silence.

1351
02:11:22,690 --> 02:11:24,817
Good night, sweet prince...

1352
02:11:25,527 --> 02:11:28,724
and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.

1353
02:14:37,785 --> 02:14:39,150
English
