1
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:10,645
What has water but no fish,

2
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:14,281
forests but no trees,
and deserts but no sand?

3
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:20,187
Help me out.

4
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:22,222
No, it's a riddle.

5
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,323
Come on,
you're not gonna help me out?

6
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,630
Wait, so you're gonna
leave me hanging?

7
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:30,264
- I don't know.
- It's a map.

8
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:33,233
-That's what I said.
-No, you didn't.

9
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,536
- I said map.
- Mm-hmm.

10
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:35,637
I whispered it,
you didn't hear?

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,304
-No.
-I said, "map."

12
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,172
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

13
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,642
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

14
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:41,743
Mm-mm.

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,146
Let's make up something.

16
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:50,852
<i>♪ I was at the vet... ♪</i>

17
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:54,121
<i>♪ ...with my pet, George ♪</i>

18
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:58,860
I mean I-- you're the singer,
I never said I was a singer,

19
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,494
you said
you were a singer, so--

20
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:02,462
- Hey, Kayla.
- Hi.

21
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:04,666
I'll take him now, okay?

22
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,333
Don't worry, he'll be right
back, okay?

23
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,676
You worried about George?

24
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,844
Yeah, but I think
he'll be all right.

25
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:18,278
Yeah,
I think he will too.

26
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:22,550
But if he's not,
we can't just say yes,

27
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,318
we have to talk
to your mother first

28
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,485
and see
how much it's gonna cost.

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,621
Screw the cost.

30
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:30,223
-Don't say "screw."
-Screw, screw, screw.

31
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:33,327
Hey.

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,395
George is very lucky
to have you watching his six.

33
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,265
We'll figure it out.

34
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,371
-Mama is still not quite--
-She's trying.

35
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,807
Just wish
she'd try a little bit harder.

36
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,175
Give her some time,
she'll get there.

37
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:52,212
- Hey, Kayla.
- Hi.

38
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,180
Wanna come back
and see Georgie?

39
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,247
Yeah.

40
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,918
All right,
it is the first one

41
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,218
on the right.

42
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:03,256
Hi, Georgie.

43
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,425
How are you? Good.

44
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,427
Hang on there, George,
hang on there, sweetie.

45
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:09,631
Oh, hi.
I don't think we've met.

46
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:11,733
- Hey.
- This is LT.

47
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:13,433
He's my dad's
commanding officer.

48
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,302
- Paul.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

49
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,771
George doesn't have
an infection

50
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,338
and that's what
we were most worried about.

51
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,340
But we did find out

52
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,743
- that he has asthma.
- Wow.

53
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:23,811
There's medication
to treat him, okay?

54
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:26,179
But you're going to have to
give it to him every day,

55
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:27,849
probably
for a couple of years, okay?

56
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,384
That's fine. It's fine.

57
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,820
Okay.

58
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:34,889
We've got George's six,
right LT?

59
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,425
No matter what.

60
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,368
Made of glass
I'm 'bout to shatter it.

61
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,638
- Come on. Let's rock.
- Do your thing, man.

62
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:51,973
Ooh, you look like

63
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,207
a straight chicken
right here, boy.

64
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,877
Give him
everything you got, Stevey.

65
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,845
Imma cook you tonight.
What're you gonna do, dawg?

66
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,681
Full tilt boogie,
baby, let's go.

67
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:06,253
God damn!

68
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:08,856
- Very nice.
- That's it, Stevey!

69
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,957
Back okay?

70
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:11,759
- Yeah.
- Good.

71
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:12,794
That's what
I'm talking about motherfucker.

72
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:14,428
How was that?

73
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,863
It was good,
you're making good decisions,

74
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:16,998
you're thinking fast.

75
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,232
-Any more?
-Him and him.

76
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,602
- Step right up, fellas.
- Same time.

77
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,707
Try this shit
with me, Stevey.

78
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,008
Look how serious he looks.

79
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,408
Come on, man, let's go.

80
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,409
Come on, motherfucker.
Let's go.

81
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,251
Hey, hey!

82
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,726
Nice!

83
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,326
Watch your back!

84
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:50,297
Hit me in the fucking throat.

85
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,435
- Nice!
- All right.

86
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:57,739
Enough.

87
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:00,474
Everyone walk away
and take a fucking chill pill.

88
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,976
This is supposed
to be training, fucker.

89
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,911
Talk about
a fucking party pooper.

90
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,652
Nice floor work,
but he's playing too rough.

91
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,454
Throat's fucking throbbing.

92
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,656
What do you want?

93
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,290
It's tough enough
finding somewhere

94
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,693
that will let you spar.

95
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,360
Three on one and somebody
wearing handcuffs.

96
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,664
But he gets a reputation
as a crazy fuck.

97
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,000
This could be crazy or fucked.

98
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,936
Teddy will make us
all find another gym.

99
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,671
Get him to pull it back.

100
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:32,305
He's got one place
where he can let it hang out,

101
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,541
come on.

102
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:34,642
Somebody saying something?

103
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,980
-Yeah, me.
-You want to say it to me?

104
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,480
Oh!

105
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:42,750
A little too rough for you?

106
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:44,652
Pull it back.

107
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,921
Stevie.

108
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,388
You trying to hurt
one of these guys?

109
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,559
- Is that what you want?
- Okay, okay.

110
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:54,562
He copies you.
Say, "okay" Stevie.

111
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:59,700
-Okay, Stevie.
-Okay. Let's hit the shower.

112
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:03,336
Yes, sir, Dr. Freud.
Hitting the shower.

113
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,440
I'm Dr. Freud now.

114
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,376
You should be a tag team,
get you in here.

115
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,913
I'm sure I can find an opponent
who'd love to kick your ass.

116
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:13,413
Yeah, I'm good.

117
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:15,082
Are you?

118
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,551
It's been so long
since you fought,

119
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,085
I can't remember
if you are anymore.

120
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,555
Let's get some sushi.

121
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,491
What is it?

122
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,863
I need you
to clear that area

123
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,064
in front of the elevator.

124
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,599
We're talking
to the detective,

125
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,466
we're gonna get it all sorted,
okay?

126
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,970
And we're gonna find her,
okay?

127
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:40,440
I know it's a lot,
but it's gonna--

128
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,543
Hi. Family friend, Paul.

129
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:44,679
Hi, I'm Alex.
I'm Kayla's therapist.

130
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,547
Her mom's in
with the detective right now.

131
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:48,115
- Thank you for being here.
- No, of course.

132
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:50,885
Um, you know what,
I actually have to get somebody

133
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,955
to cover my afternoon,
um, trauma group so--

134
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:55,089
Well, hey, you know what?

135
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,925
-I got this. We're good here.
-Got this, have you?

136
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,560
No, no, I--
I need to be here.

137
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:01,062
-I need to be here.
-No, we're good here.

138
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:02,630
I need you to move away
from those elevators,

139
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,065
we gotta keep
that space clear.

140
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,800
Okay,
just give us, uh, one second.

141
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,001
Could you give us
a minute please?

142
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,637
Um, are you okay?
Are you sure?

143
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,738
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

144
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,375
-Tell me what happened.
-The fuck do you care?

145
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:16,911
Put that shit aside for now.

146
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:22,449
You can go back to hating me

147
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,784
as soon as she's home
safe and sound,

148
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,052
but for now,
we're on the same side.

149
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,421
Yeah?

150
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,992
We got woken up
by the cops this morning

151
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,693
saying they found her bag
on the sidewalk

152
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:33,761
outside some bar.

153
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:35,630
Anything taken?

154
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,531
Mm-mm.

155
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,701
Shit, that's bad,
isn't it?

156
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:43,738
Not necessarily.

157
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,774
Look at it this way,
if her stuff was missing,

158
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,509
we wouldn't even know anything
had happened to her yet.

159
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,045
There'd be more time.
The cops would be behind them.

160
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,713
- "Them?"
- I just meant--

161
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,181
Oh, my God.
You think it was a them?

162
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:55,716
No.

163
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,684
So then
what are you saying?

164
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,019
No. I'm sorry, but no.

165
00:06:58,386 --> 00:06:59,854
You don't get
to do that right now.

166
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:04,759
You're stronger
than your mother.

167
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,528
I love Lucy like a sister,

168
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,462
but stable is not a word
I'd use to describe her.

169
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,866
So, you got to be tough.

170
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,136
Who was Kayla with
last night?

171
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:18,639
A few friends,
but she walked home by herself.

172
00:07:18,673 --> 00:07:20,775
LT!

173
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,475
They took her,
LT, they took her.

174
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,844
It's day one.

175
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:25,179
We don't know anything yet,
all right?

176
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,080
We know
they've taken my baby.

177
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,549
Okay, uh, now look,

178
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,151
I read your initial statement
to the officer

179
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:32,186
and you said
Kayla was with friends--

180
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,055
I don't fucking know
who she was with.

181
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,557
You don't know who your daughter
was with last night?

182
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,491
Was she--
was she at someone's house?

183
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,661
Was she in the street?
Was she at a bar?

184
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:42,563
My 12-year-old sister
was not at a bar.

185
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,231
-We found a backpack in front--
-I know what you're doing.

186
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:45,967
I'm trying to help-- I'm trying
to find your daughter.

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,635
You're saying
I'm a shit mother.

188
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,236
No, I'm not-- I'm not--
I'm not saying that.

189
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,871
Can we get another detective
over here, please?

190
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,540
Please lower your voice,
this isn't McDonald's,

191
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,775
you don't just order
any cop you want, okay?

192
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,711
Obviously we got McAsshole.

193
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,079
Okay, enough. Enough.
- Hold on for one second.

194
00:07:58,112 --> 00:07:59,613
Everything all right
over there, Chris?

195
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,215
Terry, Terry--
Just give us a second.

196
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,750
Look, you gotta clear
those people out of the hall.

197
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,051
We know
about your elevator, Terry.

198
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,119
Clear out,
use the office.

199
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,887
We got it, we got it. Okay.

200
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,256
Just a second, um, Detective,
thank you for everything

201
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,558
- that you're doing.
- Of course.

202
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,793
Ma'am, is there any chance

203
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:15,930
that your daughter might
just be still out partying?

204
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,866
I'll say it again.
She's 12.

205
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,935
I-- I understand that,
I can't assume anything.

206
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,703
We assume
you're being a dickhead.

207
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:24,572
-Please watch your mouth.
-All right, um--

208
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,840
-Fuck off.
-Come on, now.

209
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,642
All right, look,
I'm trying to help...

210
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:30,277
-I-- I-- yes. And we--
-...okay?

211
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:32,780
And I'll-- I'll reach out
as soon as we know anything.

212
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:33,948
- Yes.
- Okay?

213
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,716
-Thank you so much.
-Okay.

214
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,685
Thank you, we really
appreciate your help.

215
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,922
It's okay.
It's all right.

216
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,157
They're gonna help.

217
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,561
I'm sorry. All right.

218
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:50,831
- Hey, let me, please
- All right.

219
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:56,670
We're going to
figure it out, though.

220
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:57,905
Okay?

221
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,006
They're on it. We get...

222
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:05,980
Say it.

223
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,817
- He should be here, not you.
- I know.

224
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:14,321
You know, there's a part of me
that will always blame you

225
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:15,856
for what happened to him.

226
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,727
There's a part of me
that will always agree with you.

227
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,898
But I've seen you
with Kayla...

228
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,601
and I know this isn't you just
keeping some promise you made.

229
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:32,273
I know she's precious to you
like how she was to him.

230
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:34,842
You were precious
to him as well.

231
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,679
Just bring
my little sister home, LT.

232
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,247
Please.

233
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:42,316
Bella, what the fuck
are you talking about?

234
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,617
Look, I read the stats.

235
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:45,986
It'll just go on a pile.

236
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:48,823
The cops barely find people
in cases like this,

237
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:49,957
so they hardly try.

238
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:57,264
Look, I'll do
everything you ask, okay?

239
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,266
I promise.

240
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:03,037
I'll be the tough one
and I'll swallow it all down

241
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,805
and I'll keep everyone
in decent shape.

242
00:10:05,473 --> 00:10:07,975
-But you find her.
-Bella, this is a mess.

243
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,277
- What can I--
- Right there!

244
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:11,378
That look in your eyes.

245
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:13,147
Use that.

246
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,183
Look,
there was only four of us.

247
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:19,120
We lost a quarter
of our family that day.

248
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:23,157
We can't lose another.
We can't be down to half.

249
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,127
You promised him.

250
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,129
You gave him your word
you would look over her.

251
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:29,897
And you have.

252
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:32,032
You take her
to soccer practice

253
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:34,668
and you bring her home
every time.

254
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,005
I'm just asking you to do
what you always do.

255
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:41,408
Bring her home.

256
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:44,879
Okay?

257
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:23,751
What can I get you, man?

258
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:27,154
-Soda.
-All right.

259
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:30,157
-What kind you want?
-Surprise me.

260
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,961
- Your place?
- Yeah.

261
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,998
-For better or for worse.
-Hm.

262
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,443
Did you know a girl was taken
from out front of here

263
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,878
- last night?
- No, no, no.

264
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,046
- Yeah, she was.
- No.

265
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,848
Cops found some purse
outside there this morning.

266
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,285
I don't want you in here asking
about some missing girl, man.

267
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:05,859
Is she your daughter?

268
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:08,929
My friend's daughter.

269
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,004
Uh...

270
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,374
<i>- Claro, claro.</i>
- Yeah.

271
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,376
-Anyways--
-Amigo.

272
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,178
Hey, <i>papi,</i> let me-- let me
walk you to the door real quick,

273
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,279
make sure you don't slip
on your motherfucking shoelaces

274
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:26,814
on the way out.

275
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:27,748
Did you notice
this girl last night?

276
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:29,483
No.

277
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,352
Could you look at the picture,
please?

278
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,254
What picture?

279
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,155
This one.

280
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,096
Think it's time
for you to go, brother.

281
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,867
Excuse me.

282
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,269
I need to talk to you
for a second.

283
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:51,238
I want to ask you
if you've seen this girl.

284
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,307
Dude,
I'm just trying to chill here.

285
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,808
She was taken
from out front of here

286
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:55,876
last night.

287
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,212
I'm going to pass
this phone around.

288
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,913
I want everybody
to take a look.

289
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,115
Please, take a look.

290
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,151
- Okay.
- Give it here, man.

291
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,054
It's not that
kind of party, baby.

292
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:09,790
Now you done fucked up.

293
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,863
You're making
a mistake here.

294
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,132
You, all by yourself.

295
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:24,471
Jesus Christ!

296
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,376
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

297
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,222
God damn.

298
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,425
Are you fucking kidding me?

299
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,597
Look at the photo.

300
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,469
Please, man. Please.

301
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,344
Jesus Christ.

302
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,553
Oh, fuck.-

303
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:15,856
Please.

304
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,436
I've never seen her, bro.

305
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,075
Fuck.

306
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,144
Oh, fuck.

307
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,150
Oh, my God,
did you see that?

308
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,052
I know.
good God, that was insane.

309
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,391
You know,
because I used to be fun

310
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:51,659
and the life of the party,

311
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:53,595
everyone liked me
the way I was.

312
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,496
So, apparently
I did some bad things

313
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,431
- when I was drinking too much.
- Right.

314
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:01,468
But, I really don't understand
how to be any different.

315
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:04,171
So, you feel like
without the alcohol,

316
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,240
you are not the same person?

317
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,308
And that person,
you were validated for?

318
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,644
Yeah, yeah.

319
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:11,278
I was funny,
it was fun, and really,

320
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,681
if it hadn't been
for those little incidents,

321
00:15:13,715 --> 00:15:15,717
um, I think
I would be fine and great.

322
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,585
And I don't think I really
needed to quit drinking,

323
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:20,387
but, to be honest,
I think I drink sometimes

324
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,022
to make
other people interesting.

325
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,592
Interesting.

326
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:28,162
Okay, there's a lot that
we need to, um, unwrap here,

327
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:30,964
but we need to end
our session now.

328
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,300
But we will continue
with that next time.

329
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:37,371
I hope I will see
each and every one of you

330
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,040
at the Be Positive barbecue
this weekend.

331
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:43,444
Um, and until then,
I hope you have a great week.

332
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:47,047
- Okay? Bye, you guys.
- Bye, Dr. Alex.

333
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,215
Thank you, Graham.

334
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,629
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm?

335
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:04,431
Hi, um,
my name is Paul and--

336
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:05,767
Oh, Paul.
Right, right, right.

337
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,167
How's Lucy?

338
00:16:07,535 --> 00:16:10,538
She's, um,
not doing so hot.

339
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,172
Yeah.

340
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,343
Uh, can I ask you
some questions?

341
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,712
Of course, yes.

342
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:19,012
Um...

343
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:21,482
I was just wondering
if there was anything

344
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:23,450
you can tell me
about your time with Kayla.

345
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,587
Um, anything
she may have said--

346
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,087
You know,
I wish there was, Paul,

347
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,355
I really do.

348
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:32,159
I mean, Kayla was a happy kid.
I mean, you know that.

349
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:35,395
She used to spend sessions
trying to make me laugh,

350
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,799
-you know, making up those, um--
-Her riddles.

351
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:40,535
Riddles.
Yes, the riddles.

352
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,171
You know, I-- I...

353
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,375
I don't think she ran away,
if that's what you're asking.

354
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:52,412
No, I don't either.

355
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:55,717
I-- I meant more um...

356
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,086
were there any friends,

357
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,088
older maybe,
that she talked about,

358
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,790
people she might have
just met who--

359
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,326
You know, Kayla's sessions
were court-ordered, right?

360
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,695
Because of all the stuff
with her mom.

361
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:09,764
So, if anything
like that happened,

362
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:13,300
I was mandated
to let CPS know immediately.

363
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,737
-Oh, yeah, no, I'm not saying--
-No, no, I-- I know.

364
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,540
I'm just-- listen,
I will answer your questions

365
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:19,641
for as long as you want.

366
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,810
I just wish that
there was something more helpful

367
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,646
that I could offer you.

368
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,517
Do you mind if I play
therapist for a second

369
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:30,718
and ask you
how you're doing?

370
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:33,621
I'm good.

371
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:34,722
You know...

372
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,125
Kayla told me a lot...

373
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:40,828
about you,
she talked about you a lot.

374
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,198
But,
what she didn't tell me...

375
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,068
was how bad of a liar
you are.

376
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:52,507
Wish I had been there
when she needed me.

377
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,809
No, no, no, no.
Paul, don't do that.

378
00:17:56,911 --> 00:18:00,748
We always want to find
something to blame

379
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:02,282
in moments like this.

380
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,118
Even if it's ourselves,
but you can't do that.

381
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,254
It's not helpful.

382
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:10,390
Hm.

383
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:33,034
Shit, motherfuck--

384
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:37,304
Hey!

385
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:40,340
Hey!

386
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:42,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

387
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:57,892
Fuck you, Eddie,
what would you be saying, man?

388
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,426
You see me like this,
right?

389
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,532
I'm all right.
I'm good, bro.

390
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:06,734
Don't you worry about me,
all right?

391
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:11,906
I'm okay.

392
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:20,413
Fucking buck up.

393
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,925
This shit right.

394
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:56,584
Upstairs.

395
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:57,685
Yeah, up here.

396
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,989
Let's get him
in the bathroom.

397
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:03,624
- We gotta move.
- Come on, man.

398
00:22:03,658 --> 00:22:05,827
Come on, up you go.

399
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,829
Easy. I got him.

400
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,598
Put him down here.

401
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,968
LT.
What'd you take, man?

402
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,671
Hm?

403
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:19,439
What did you take?
What did you take, asshole?

404
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,776
Wake up, man.
Answer him.

405
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:23,845
Hey, he's gonna keep on
doing that 'til you answer, man.

406
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:25,580
Yeah, I got pulled off a date
for this shit.

407
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:27,982
Slap you for fun, now.

408
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,482
I know, Stevey.

409
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:31,986
Shit.

410
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,491
Here you go.
Into the tub.

411
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:39,994
Xanax and Valium.

412
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:42,395
That shit's coming up, right?

413
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:46,466
LT, I'm gonna stick my fingers
down your throat.

414
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,103
If you bite me,
I will break your fucking nose.

415
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:50,905
All right?

416
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:53,074
Stop fucking moving.

417
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:03,117
Where the fuck are we,
Paul?

418
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,852
There's more.

419
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:07,922
One more time, man.
One more time.

420
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,801
The fuck, man?

421
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:24,572
Paul,
this shit's gotta stop.

422
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:28,542
-Nobody asked you to come over.
-You fucking called me.

423
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:34,481
- I called you?
- Yeah.

424
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:37,985
- Why would I do that?
- Fuck if I know.

425
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:39,687
You know, usually,

426
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,756
if you're really gonna do it,
you don't call.

427
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:45,693
I was probably calling
to say goodbye.

428
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,665
Next time, don't.

429
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:51,933
- Dude--
- Fuck you.

430
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:58,639
I failed him, Mac.

431
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:03,811
I swore I'd look after
his daughter, and I...

432
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:08,950
We owed him.

433
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:13,220
What happened to Bobby
was our fault,

434
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:15,156
our responsibility, we---

435
00:24:18,793 --> 00:24:20,493
I don't ever
want to hear those words

436
00:24:20,528 --> 00:24:22,063
come out of your mouth again.

437
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:23,496
You got it?

438
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:25,700
I love my brother
and I love you.

439
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:27,500
But I won't let you hurt us,

440
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:29,870
just to unburden
your own conscience.

441
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:32,106
Come on, man.
Come on, man.

442
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,877
Seriously!

443
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:51,491
Where the fuck are we, Paul?

444
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,661
Airbnb.

445
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,537
Pretty nice spot.

446
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:05,873
Go out in style?

447
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,877
Eh, something like that.

448
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:12,113
Jesus Christ.

449
00:25:12,913 --> 00:25:14,982
Stevie,
go call a cleaning company

450
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:17,718
and find somebody, maybe Dean,
to fix the front door.

451
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:18,819
Copy.

452
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,223
- Steve?
- Yes, sir?

453
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:24,191
You said
you was on a date.

454
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:25,926
I did.

455
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:27,862
Going well?

456
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:37,238
Fuck you both!

457
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,241
Oh, God.

458
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:45,913
How did you find me, Mac?

459
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:48,282
- Don't worry about it.
- Mac.

460
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:52,787
Jordy.

461
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:55,689
Shit.

462
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,159
Put a track and trace
on your phone

463
00:25:58,192 --> 00:25:59,293
after you called me.

464
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:06,267
What'd he tell his boss?

465
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,136
He said he was following up
a lead on a case.

466
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:11,172
He lied.

467
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:18,245
This shit's got to
hit the road, brother.

468
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:22,349
You got to be done with it
and then be done with it.

469
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:30,925
I got to get home.
It's my weekend with the kids.

470
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:33,294
Stevey will stick around.

471
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:36,664
Get this shit straight.

472
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:41,068
Don't try
to kill yourself again today.

473
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:43,237
I already looked for her.

474
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,778
Didn't even go
looking for her.

475
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:52,980
You kept her dog.

476
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,819
She loved that fucking dog
and you kept it safe.

477
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,788
That's something.

478
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:04,792
That's bottom
of the fucking barrel.

479
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:08,762
Maybe that's all
you got left to give, man.

480
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,285
While the fire fight
is going on...

481
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:35,890
the VC button planted
an anti-tank mine.

482
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:39,460
-So, he got blown up.
-Instead of you.

483
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:40,761
-Instead of me.
-Yeah.

484
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:43,197
So, now what happens is,
I get out of my track

485
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,132
and show up
and I go running up to him

486
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,334
and the poor guy was--
he was covered...

487
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:50,371
he didn't wear his--
the flack jacket,

488
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:53,073
so he was covered
from the waist up

489
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:54,175
with burning oil.

490
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:57,211
The only part of him
that wasn't burnt

491
00:27:57,244 --> 00:27:59,914
was his actual hair
because he had,

492
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:01,248
you know, the--
one of the--

493
00:28:01,282 --> 00:28:02,983
-the track helmets on.
-Right.

494
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:05,286
Everything else was burnt.

495
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:07,321
So...

496
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:10,958
when I ran up to him,
he started to fall.

497
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,828
Natural first reaction,
try to catch him.

498
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:15,930
Yeah.

499
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:17,731
Uh...

500
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:22,836
-All right.
-You're all right.

501
00:28:23,672 --> 00:28:25,507
Yeah, I just have
a little problem with this.

502
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,841
And, uh, his skin
came off on my hands.

503
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,444
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

504
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:33,314
And my nickname in the service,
for whatever reason, was Tiny.

505
00:28:33,347 --> 00:28:35,316
And the last words
I got out of him was, you know,

506
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:36,417
"Tiny don't let me die."

507
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:38,886
We got him on the medevac.

508
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,889
He lasted about a month
and then the heart gave out.

509
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:52,833
Hey, Tiny. Where's LT?

510
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:55,769
He's in the bathroom,
making himself look pretty.

511
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:59,240
LT! I wanna buy you a drink

512
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:01,308
It was because--
because it was--

513
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:04,278
It was probably
the first war ever

514
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:06,947
that they didn't do
anything strategically.

515
00:29:07,682 --> 00:29:09,984
Where they took a--
they took a place, whatever,

516
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:11,352
because they wanted numbers,

517
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:12,753
they wanted body counts
and so forth.

518
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:14,989
So, we took this thing
three times

519
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:16,290
to give it back each time

520
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:17,791
Washington wanted you
on the hill,

521
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:19,226
then they wanted you
off the hill.

522
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,928
Well-- but, I mean--

523
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,496
Yeah, but you know what?

524
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,566
It was the first war that
I know of that was actually,

525
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,333
instead of being run
by the Pentagon,

526
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:27,468
it was run by Congress.

527
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:29,937
And that was just
plain asinine.

528
00:29:30,572 --> 00:29:32,540
No, because you got
all politicians there,

529
00:29:32,574 --> 00:29:34,341
you know, making decisions.

530
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,209
And they're not the--

531
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:36,410
Brendan!

532
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:42,349
Brendan, you alcoholic!
He's actually not kidding.

533
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,525
You want to
mumble that again?

534
00:29:58,032 --> 00:29:59,400
He never shuts up.

535
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:00,868
What the fuck?

536
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:03,871
A human IED.

537
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,911
- Hey, welcome home.
- Oh, I'm fine.

538
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:16,551
Hey, shut up--

539
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:19,253
Who told you guys
to talk? I said be quiet--

540
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,289
- Tiny!
- Never saw it coming.

541
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:23,924
You don't look good.

542
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,427
What do you mean
I don't look good?

543
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,028
You don't look good.

544
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:30,130
You look like you're bad
saying you're good.

545
00:30:30,732 --> 00:30:33,133
- That doesn't even make sense.
- It does make sense.

546
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:35,035
Jordy--

547
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,270
You're saying the word good,
but your eyes don't read good,

548
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:37,371
your eyes read bad.

549
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,009
You know,
when you're coming back

550
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:42,910
and you're getting
all this stuff.

551
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:45,946
Because I had one time,
you know, uh,

552
00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:47,247
division at the time,

553
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:48,849
just mechanized
infantry division.

554
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,519
And we were attached to the...

555
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:54,888
Screaming Eagles,
the 101st.

556
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,217
Hey, Paul.

557
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:26,353
Do I know you?

558
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:29,189
I come in peace.

559
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:30,891
Come in peace,
standing exactly where you are.

560
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,394
Tell your friend behind me

561
00:31:33,427 --> 00:31:34,596
my knife will be buried
in your heart

562
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:35,896
before he's ever
raised that gun.

563
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:46,541
Let's get to who you are
real quick, yeah?

564
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,212
I am someone
whose 12 year old cousin

565
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:54,114
was abducted from the Bronx
three days ago.

566
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:10,698
Pick it up
on your way out.

567
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:14,401
How do we know that
you don't have a gun in here?

568
00:32:14,435 --> 00:32:15,570
I do have a gun in here.

569
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:42,362
Sorry about your cousin.

570
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:46,166
- Sophia.
- Sophia.

571
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:50,204
But I don't know
how I can help.

572
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:52,607
We know you were looking
for a kid awhile back.

573
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,742
Just tell us everything
that happened

574
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:56,711
with your friend's daughter.

575
00:32:56,744 --> 00:32:58,045
And we thought you might
sympathize with my situation,

576
00:32:58,078 --> 00:32:59,681
given your loss.

577
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:01,549
- Who am I talking to here?
- Nigga, can you count?

578
00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:04,017
-Both of us is here.
-Talk to me.

579
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:07,421
-Guess I know now, huh?
-What're you smirking for?

580
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:10,324
Hey.

581
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,428
Tell this nigga if he goes
for the backup piece

582
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:16,664
on his ankle,
he'll die right where he stands.

583
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:18,332
- AJ.
- Huh?

584
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:20,334
Chill out.

585
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:21,769
-I'm cool.
-No, you're not.

586
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,638
You should rest.

587
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:26,273
AJ.

588
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:28,208
Go sit in the corner

589
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:29,276
and think about
what you've done.

590
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:31,111
Put down the gun and get
in the conversation, Paul.

591
00:33:31,713 --> 00:33:33,748
Because worse than
AJ pulling out the wrong weapon

592
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:35,148
would be certain people
finding out

593
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,251
that you pulled a weapon,

594
00:33:37,284 --> 00:33:40,053
any fucking weapon,
on Juan Gomez's daughter.

595
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:42,055
Who's Juan Gomez?

596
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:46,393
You're daddy's little girl?

597
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:48,228
I don't think you want to
be talking to me like that.

598
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:49,664
He's locked up right? Daddy?

599
00:33:57,572 --> 00:33:58,840
Can you tell me
what happened

600
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:00,508
to your friend's daughter,
please?

601
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:01,743
I didn't find her.
That's what happened.

602
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:05,513
I have a witness...

603
00:34:07,147 --> 00:34:08,683
who thinks that
he might have seen the van

604
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:10,350
that Sophia was kidnapped in.

605
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,257
He even got part
of a license plate.

606
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,358
An A and a Y.

607
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:25,499
Kid drew it for us.

608
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:28,368
We don't want to go
to the police

609
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:29,871
for obvious reasons.

610
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:31,573
So, I thought that
you might have some contacts

611
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:33,273
who could help us
under the radar.

612
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,377
Kind of contacts
who could get an ex-soldier

613
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,279
out of lockup

614
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:41,816
the day that he punches a cop
on a street full of people.

615
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:44,619
- Should I be flattered?
- No charges.

616
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:48,388
-You used my phone call.
-You punched a police officer.

617
00:34:55,797 --> 00:34:58,131
-Time to go.
-I'll pay you.

618
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:02,102
Ten grand?

619
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:04,639
Time to go.

620
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,809
Big Juan, it's Juan Gomez.

621
00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:09,209
Who the fuck's Juan Gomez?

622
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:10,712
Who the fuck's Juan Gomez?

623
00:35:10,745 --> 00:35:12,680
Juan Gomez, he's got
a giant piece of the drugs

624
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:14,281
coming in and out of Queens.

625
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:15,449
My colleagues
have been investigating

626
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:17,250
this piece of shit for years.

627
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:19,486
He's doing ten years upstate
as of a few months ago.

628
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,488
His daughter runs the operation
while he's gone.

629
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:22,857
So we're getting in bed

630
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,726
with Mexican drug dealers now,
are we?

631
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:26,728
Good stuff.
Good decision making.

632
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:30,531
What?

633
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:33,200
What that?
What is it? What?

634
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:36,871
Do you remember
that time Bobby laughed so hard

635
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:38,773
that he shat himself
in that fucking bunker?

636
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:42,677
And we had to stay there,
we couldn't--

637
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:46,748
there was nowhere to go.

638
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:52,452
- Fucking stew eating idiot.
- Oh, my God.

639
00:35:58,793 --> 00:36:00,695
So, what did you say
to the Mexican chick?

640
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:02,396
I said no.

641
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:07,200
No, no, you're not--

642
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:09,804
Jordy, come on.
You-- you know everyone, man.

643
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,204
And your office alone--

644
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:12,707
just get
one of your colleagues

645
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,709
to give us a list
of registered sex offenders

646
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:15,910
in the area and I can---

647
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:17,812
You can go door to door
and beat up everybody in Queens

648
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:19,346
until what?

649
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:20,882
You happen upon
the asshole who has her?

650
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:22,182
You're making this
about Kayla.

651
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:25,485
What do you want me
to do, Jordy?

652
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,689
- Go be with Bella and Lucy.
- Why?

653
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:29,757
Let the Mexicans
do their thing

654
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,959
-while we do ours.
-Which is what?

655
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:33,961
Which is to look after
Bobby's family,

656
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:35,830
like he would have done
for any of us.

657
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:39,466
This is not gonna
bring Kayla back.

658
00:36:43,037 --> 00:36:44,706
I hate to be the one
to say it.

659
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,474
- That girl's dead.
- We owe Bobby better.

660
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:50,678
-Go the fuck home.
-It was our idea.

661
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:54,015
-You mean it was my idea.
-I made the call.

662
00:36:54,048 --> 00:36:56,416
You act like you're the only one
who loved him.

663
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,019
Like you're the only one
who hurts.

664
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:00,021
Like, you're the only one
who misses him.

665
00:37:00,054 --> 00:37:01,756
Well, it's bullshit.

666
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,992
We were all there, man.
All of us.

667
00:37:05,593 --> 00:37:07,895
We all hurt, and we all see
his face in the dark

668
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:08,996
when we're alone.

669
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,363
You don't own that.

670
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:13,634
I made the call, Jordy.

671
00:37:15,737 --> 00:37:18,539
Yeah. You made the call.

672
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:54,474
<i>the fuck you want?</i>

673
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:57,011
Yeah, yeah, shut the fuck up.
You don't sleep anyway.

674
00:37:57,745 --> 00:38:00,948
Listen, I need you to get
one of your colleagues

675
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:02,415
to look into something
for me.

676
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:22,737
And Hernandez
is coming tomorrow.

677
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:27,742
- Mm-hmm. Wired. Yeah.
- Wired.

678
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:29,911
AJ!

679
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:33,981
Please tell me
I can throw him out.

680
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:35,382
No. Send him over.

681
00:38:35,883 --> 00:38:38,886
And AJ. Be polite.

682
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:41,722
Show him the side of you
that I know.

683
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:46,727
Not this guy.

684
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:47,895
-That's how I look?
-Yeah.

685
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:49,496
It's not cute.

686
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:18,993
Swipe right.

687
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:29,503
Is that the van?

688
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:31,371
Maybe.

689
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:34,742
Who gave this to you?

690
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,578
If I told you that,
he'd stop doing favors for me.

691
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:41,381
-I mean, this has got to be it.
-Might be.

692
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:44,552
- Do you know where it is?
- Parked in the street in Queens.

693
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:46,419
- Where?
- Three things.

694
00:39:47,622 --> 00:39:49,957
First, you don't make a move
without me.

695
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:52,126
-As in not one.
-Wait.

696
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:55,663
Sorry,
you're giving me conditions?

697
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:58,633
Do you have any idea
what I could do to you?

698
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,134
No, what could you do?

699
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:03,470
I hire and fire
tough guys like you everyday.

700
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:04,906
Oh, I'm not a tough guy.

701
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:09,010
Second, I'm in charge.

702
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:11,612
We do it all as a team,

703
00:40:11,646 --> 00:40:13,047
but if a call is needed,
I make it,

704
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,548
-you comply.
-The fuck?

705
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:15,950
Someone has to be in charge

706
00:40:15,983 --> 00:40:17,450
and it sure as shit
ain't gonna be you.

707
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:18,719
Why the fuck
would I let you--

708
00:40:18,753 --> 00:40:19,921
Do you know
where the van is parked?

709
00:40:26,227 --> 00:40:27,494
Okay.

710
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:29,897
You're the man.

711
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:33,668
-What's third?
-Third, no cops.

712
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:36,704
Fuckin' duh.

713
00:40:59,026 --> 00:41:01,629
We could be waiting days
for this guy to even show up.

714
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:02,730
Or girl.

715
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:05,733
Sure, I'll play.

716
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:07,969
We could be waiting days
for this girl

717
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:09,670
that we're going to fuck up
to show.

718
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:24,952
How many guys
does your father have

719
00:41:24,986 --> 00:41:26,053
looking for Sophia?

720
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:28,522
Um.

721
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:32,994
He doesn't know you and AJ
are looking for her, does he?

722
00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:34,494
What are you talking about?

723
00:41:35,396 --> 00:41:37,131
He didn't want to bring
attention to the business,

724
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:38,632
did he?

725
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:42,670
That gonna be a problem,
Lieutenant?

726
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:44,572
I prefer
playing off the radar.

727
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:48,576
Okay, good.

728
00:41:56,684 --> 00:41:58,652
Hey, look.

729
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:02,690
- Wait, wait, wait--
- Yeah, whatever you say, boss.

730
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:06,761
We don't even know
if that's the guy.

731
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,076
Fuck.

732
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:56,844
You want to chat
while I'm chasing?

733
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:58,112
That's exactly
what I want to do.

734
00:42:58,145 --> 00:42:59,780
Keep telling me
where you are.

735
00:42:59,814 --> 00:43:01,182
He's running
like a fucking bat out of hell.

736
00:43:01,215 --> 00:43:02,950
-Don't shoot him.
-I don't have a gun.

737
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:04,652
Why the hell
are you chasing him then?

738
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:06,787
He's-- he's going
into the dry cleaner.

739
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:08,889
No, don't go in after him.

740
00:43:08,923 --> 00:43:10,091
He's gonna try
to go out the back.

741
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,111
Who the fuck are you?

742
00:43:33,414 --> 00:43:35,950
No!

743
00:43:41,689 --> 00:43:43,157
Oh, okay, okay.

744
00:43:44,992 --> 00:43:47,761
I-- I'm in the dry cleaner's.
I'm in the dry cleaner's.

745
00:43:50,998 --> 00:43:52,833
Okay.

746
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,978
Hey!

747
00:44:05,713 --> 00:44:08,415
- No, no, no, no.
- The fuck is going on here?

748
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:12,653
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Shut up!

749
00:44:16,123 --> 00:44:17,992
Fucking English, man,
how many times I gotta tell you?

750
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:19,093
Now shut the fuck up.

751
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:23,998
Stop talking to him.

752
00:44:28,035 --> 00:44:29,303
She don't get the-- hey,

753
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:30,404
do you know
where the fuck you at?

754
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:35,709
Did you say Lopez?

755
00:44:35,743 --> 00:44:37,444
As in Sonny Lopez?

756
00:44:37,811 --> 00:44:40,714
No, I know Sonny Lopez.

757
00:44:40,748 --> 00:44:42,049
Oh, good.

758
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:43,417
So does everybody
and his fucking momma.

759
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,152
No, I-- I--
I really know Sonny Lopez.

760
00:44:45,186 --> 00:44:46,320
No, I-- I, um--

761
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:51,825
Bitch, stop talking to him

762
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,994
-and talk to me.
-Okay. I'm sorry.

763
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:55,095
I'm talking to you.

764
00:44:58,065 --> 00:44:59,900
Jesus, how many fucking
many of you are there?

765
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:04,038
Look, bitch,

766
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:05,406
I'm just gonna chop your ass up
into little pieces,

767
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:06,874
spread you all over
this fucking city.

768
00:45:06,907 --> 00:45:08,209
All right, well,
that would be a bad idea

769
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:09,343
because I run
with Big Juan's crew.

770
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:10,978
- Big Juan?
- Yeah.

771
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:12,112
Jungle Club owner Big Juan?
Big Juan, Big Juan?

772
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:13,247
- Yeah.
- The fuck out of here.

773
00:45:13,648 --> 00:45:15,015
-You for real?
-Yeah.

774
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:16,817
Yo, yo, yo, prove it.

775
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,319
What's the name
of those three big ass dogs

776
00:45:18,352 --> 00:45:19,887
Big Juan lets
roam around over there?

777
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,923
Apollo, Rocky, and Adonis.

778
00:45:22,957 --> 00:45:24,258
What's the name
of them dogs, man?

779
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:26,827
-I don't fucking know.
-Fucking morons.

780
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,928
- I'm the--
- Stay still.

781
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:31,432
I'm the manager
at the Jungle.

782
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:33,801
- Shut the fuck up.
- My name is Lola.

783
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:35,102
I was just
at that motherfucking club

784
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:36,870
two weeks ago
and they had told me

785
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:38,906
that Big Juan's daughter
is the one that manages the--

786
00:45:43,177 --> 00:45:46,146
-You said your name was Lola?
-It's nice to meet you.

787
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:49,049
Fuck... fuck...

788
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:50,951
Lola, shit. It's me, Jimmy.
You remember?

789
00:45:50,985 --> 00:45:52,820
Last year we met
when we were going to go over

790
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:54,788
that garbage truck thing
we were all going to get into?

791
00:45:54,822 --> 00:45:55,923
-Remember that?
-Oh, yeah.

792
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:57,391
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

793
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,093
Can you not point the gun at me
anymore, please?

794
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:00,327
- Oh, shit, sorry.
- Thank you.

795
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:07,234
That's just a misunderstanding.
You know what I mean?

796
00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:08,902
We ain't got to tell
nobody about this.

797
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:10,170
- This should stay between us.
- Yeah.

798
00:46:10,204 --> 00:46:11,805
-Ain't gotta go nowhere.
-Hey, relax.

799
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,875
-No, it was my fault.
-I mean, it kind of was.

800
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:16,977
I mean, I ran into the shop
unannounced.

801
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:18,580
So, totally justified
for you to point

802
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:20,515
- a fucking shotgun at me.
- This ain't our shop.

803
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:22,883
We just here grabbing up
the money and the gear.

804
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:25,119
The fool that owns this joint
owes Sonny 15 Gs.

805
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:27,888
Oh.

806
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:29,123
All right,
well, I gotta bounce.

807
00:46:29,156 --> 00:46:30,558
I was just in here
chasing this guy

808
00:46:30,592 --> 00:46:32,359
- who came through here--
- Wait, hold up.

809
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:33,927
You're talking like a gringito?
A little white boy?

810
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:37,831
-Yeah.
-You mean, this white boy?

811
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,461
You can never be ready
for this.

812
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,401
Time is gonna move very slowly
for you in this room.

813
00:47:18,205 --> 00:47:21,175
And I want you to have something
that will remind you of life.

814
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:23,177
Of good.

815
00:47:23,745 --> 00:47:25,412
Of a place other than here

816
00:47:25,446 --> 00:47:27,348
that you can hopefully
get back to

817
00:47:27,381 --> 00:47:29,483
if you tell me
what I want to know.

818
00:47:38,926 --> 00:47:40,361
I haven't done this
in a long time,

819
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:42,363
so I have to admit
I'm kind of excited.

820
00:47:44,398 --> 00:47:45,466
Are you excited?

821
00:47:47,368 --> 00:47:48,536
Are you excited?

822
00:48:01,115 --> 00:48:03,350
No, no.

823
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:05,953
- No.
- No? No what?

824
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:12,627
Gang's all here.

825
00:48:13,728 --> 00:48:15,462
All right, guys,

826
00:48:15,496 --> 00:48:17,264
Nathan and I were just
getting to know each other.

827
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:21,569
He wants to be of service.

828
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:25,607
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

829
00:48:26,974 --> 00:48:28,108
Have you seen this girl?

830
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:33,914
No.

831
00:48:35,149 --> 00:48:36,216
Where is she?

832
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:45,058
I don't know.

833
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,065
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

834
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,168
- Are you sure?
- Mm-mm.

835
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:57,539
Mm-mm.

836
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:04,344
You guys believe him?

837
00:49:06,146 --> 00:49:07,981
- You believe him?
- No.

838
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:11,285
- I don't know.
- Sorry.

839
00:49:11,886 --> 00:49:13,555
- I don't know.
- I'm outvoted.

840
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:16,323
No, no, no, no!

841
00:49:16,356 --> 00:49:18,091
Put the towel--
there you go, there you go.

842
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,461
- Don't, don't!
- Water, Lo-- Lola.

843
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:22,564
No, no, no, no!

844
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:25,199
- Water, water.
- No, no, no, no, no!

845
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:27,602
More, more, more, yeah.

846
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:29,737
More, more, more, yeah.

847
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:32,674
Yeah, more. Yeah, yeah.

848
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:35,577
Another one, another one.
Okay, yeah.

849
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,277
Yeah, just like we talked,
just like we talked.

850
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:41,348
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All in there. All in.

851
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:44,485
Yeah, Yeah.
Another one, another one.

852
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:47,555
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
Another one, another one.

853
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:49,289
Yeah.

854
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:52,594
Yeah, there you go.
There you go. There you go.

855
00:49:52,627 --> 00:49:55,597
More. More. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

856
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,298
Yeah. Come on.

857
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:00,267
Bring him up.

858
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:12,179
Where is she, Nathan?

859
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:15,148
Nathan.

860
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:19,319
Nathan. Where is she?

861
00:50:30,464 --> 00:50:31,599
Fuck you!

862
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:34,434
Fuck you!

863
00:50:34,468 --> 00:50:36,436
Huh? How 'bout that?
Fuck you!

864
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,139
I don't fucking know!
I don't fucking know.

865
00:50:43,745 --> 00:50:45,212
I don't know.

866
00:50:45,647 --> 00:50:46,681
Good for you.

867
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:49,584
No, no, no, no, no!
Please! Please!

868
00:50:49,984 --> 00:50:51,351
Please, please!

869
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:54,589
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no!

870
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:57,625
There you go.
There you go. There we go.

871
00:50:57,659 --> 00:51:00,662
Now we here. Now we here.

872
00:51:00,695 --> 00:51:03,196
Come on. Now we focus.
There we go.

873
00:51:04,866 --> 00:51:07,769
Oh, yeah.
He wants more. He wants more.

874
00:51:08,268 --> 00:51:09,771
Going fishing
underwater, huh?

875
00:51:09,804 --> 00:51:11,573
Yeah. Yeah.

876
00:51:11,606 --> 00:51:13,073
We don't miss
out on no shit, man.

877
00:51:13,508 --> 00:51:16,143
Come on. Come on. Again.

878
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:17,812
There you go.
There you go.

879
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:19,847
Another one.
Go ahead, another one.

880
00:51:22,215 --> 00:51:24,351
Water gonna solve that.
Talking all that shit.

881
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,654
All right,
bring him up.

882
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:41,603
I don't know!

883
00:51:43,938 --> 00:51:45,472
I don't know.

884
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:48,676
- Nathan.
- Please, God.

885
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,377
You're gonna kill me
and I don't--

886
00:51:50,778 --> 00:51:54,147
Hey, hey, hey.
I don't wanna kill you.

887
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:57,384
- I don't wanna kill you.
- I don't know.

888
00:52:00,755 --> 00:52:01,856
Where is she?

889
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:06,594
I don't know.

890
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:12,232
Excuse me, Nathan.

891
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:26,714
What if it was just a van
with a similar design?

892
00:52:27,347 --> 00:52:29,216
Then we're going to
break an innocent man

893
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:30,952
in a way that
he'll probably stay broken

894
00:52:30,985 --> 00:52:33,453
until he hangs himself
in his closet.

895
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:35,489
This is what it is.

896
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:37,925
You want to get Sophia back?

897
00:52:38,726 --> 00:52:40,193
Yeah.

898
00:52:40,227 --> 00:52:41,495
Then we gotta look
under the rocks

899
00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:43,497
and ignore all the bugs.

900
00:52:54,307 --> 00:52:55,510
You gotta choose, Nathan.

901
00:52:58,345 --> 00:52:59,814
And it's a simple choice.

902
00:53:01,516 --> 00:53:03,551
Nobody holds out
with this method.

903
00:53:03,584 --> 00:53:04,652
Nobody.

904
00:53:06,954 --> 00:53:08,355
And there's no shame in it.

905
00:53:08,723 --> 00:53:11,391
Bad motherfuckers
cave in to this shit.

906
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,461
I saw one guy.

907
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:18,533
One. Fahid was his name.

908
00:53:19,332 --> 00:53:21,669
One of bin Laden's
personal bodyguards.

909
00:53:21,703 --> 00:53:23,738
He took it for five days,

910
00:53:23,771 --> 00:53:25,238
but that's all
he'd been trained to do

911
00:53:25,272 --> 00:53:26,339
his whole life.

912
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:28,208
Resist torture.

913
00:53:30,678 --> 00:53:31,746
Nathan.

914
00:53:33,648 --> 00:53:34,882
Have you trained
your whole life

915
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:36,316
to resist torture?

916
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,860
You'll tell me eventually.

917
00:53:48,563 --> 00:53:51,498
We'll keep doing this
'til you die.

918
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:54,602
- Do you know--
- Yes.

919
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:05,546
Is she alive?

920
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:09,449
Is she alive?

921
00:54:10,852 --> 00:54:11,919
Is she?

922
00:54:17,992 --> 00:54:19,392
You took this girl?

923
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:23,396
- When?
- Uh...

924
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:25,633
a few days ago.

925
00:54:26,768 --> 00:54:27,835
Is she alive?

926
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:32,940
I don't know.

927
00:54:35,342 --> 00:54:37,712
You don't know?
How could you not know?

928
00:54:37,745 --> 00:54:39,046
I just do
pick up and delivery.

929
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,848
Pick up
and delivery for who?

930
00:54:40,882 --> 00:54:42,583
- I don't know.
- All these "I don't knows."

931
00:54:45,385 --> 00:54:48,556
I don't know, I'm--
I'm telling you the truth.

932
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:49,991
I don't know. Fuck.

933
00:54:50,024 --> 00:54:51,726
I don't waste time
with little fingers

934
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:53,795
and earlobes,
like the CIA does.

935
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:56,731
Answer my questions.

936
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:03,504
I'll cut off
both your thumbs.

937
00:55:03,538 --> 00:55:05,907
Pick up and delivery for who?

938
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,376
I don't know.
Oh, Go-- I swear, okay?

939
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:10,711
I swear.

940
00:55:10,745 --> 00:55:12,479
I don't even see
the people, okay?

941
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:14,515
But I don't think
they do any harm to them.

942
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:16,383
I really don't think
they do any harm to the girl.

943
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:17,518
How could you know that?

944
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:20,054
They told me to put,
um, blankets

945
00:55:20,087 --> 00:55:22,455
and-- and food in the van.

946
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:25,092
They told me
what music to play them,

947
00:55:25,126 --> 00:55:26,994
just to keep them calm
in the drive, okay?

948
00:55:27,028 --> 00:55:28,461
Music?

949
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:29,697
Where did you take Sophia?

950
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,364
Deep in the woods upstate.

951
00:55:31,398 --> 00:55:32,900
I call them
and they tell them,

952
00:55:32,934 --> 00:55:34,702
uh, how long it's going to
take me to get there.

953
00:55:34,735 --> 00:55:36,003
And then
I just drop them off.

954
00:55:36,037 --> 00:55:37,772
I just drop them
off and I drive away.

955
00:55:37,805 --> 00:55:39,406
And I don't see anyone.
I don't see anyone.

956
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:40,842
And then I get
the money in my account

957
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:42,143
a few hours later.

958
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:43,376
How many times
have you done this?

959
00:55:44,078 --> 00:55:45,680
Um--

960
00:55:45,713 --> 00:55:47,048
How many times
have you done this?

961
00:55:47,081 --> 00:55:48,649
About nine. About nine.
About nine. Okay?

962
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:50,618
I've been doing it
for about eight months.

963
00:55:51,052 --> 00:55:52,520
How do you choose the girl?

964
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:54,055
I don't.
I don't choose them.

965
00:55:54,088 --> 00:55:55,623
I don't choose them, okay?

966
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:57,091
They-- they just call me
when they have one

967
00:55:57,124 --> 00:55:59,459
and, uh,
they give me their name

968
00:55:59,492 --> 00:56:02,630
and their location
and, uh, the music.

969
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:04,397
The music, right?

970
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,701
And then-- then I have
ten days uh, to locate them

971
00:56:06,734 --> 00:56:08,002
or-- or it's voided.

972
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:09,402
Tell me
everything that happened

973
00:56:09,436 --> 00:56:11,038
from the second
you took Sophia.

974
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:13,440
Fuck, you're gonna
fucking cut my finger off.

975
00:56:13,473 --> 00:56:14,742
- That's right, I am.
- Or what?

976
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:16,577
Um, she--

977
00:56:16,978 --> 00:56:18,179
Answer the fucking question.

978
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:19,680
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

979
00:56:19,714 --> 00:56:21,582
She took her gag off
in the van, okay?

980
00:56:21,616 --> 00:56:23,517
And this never
happened before.

981
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,419
And, um, I-- I couldn't stop,
because I was on the highway,

982
00:56:26,453 --> 00:56:28,522
so I-- I just had to
let her keep it off.

983
00:56:28,556 --> 00:56:30,423
And-- and-- and she talked
the whole time,

984
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:31,592
the whole ride up.

985
00:56:33,594 --> 00:56:34,695
What did she say?

986
00:56:36,998 --> 00:56:38,633
"My name is Sophia."
Over and over.

987
00:56:41,102 --> 00:56:42,502
Did she say anything else?

988
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:44,839
She begged me
to take her home.

989
00:57:25,012 --> 00:57:26,180
Hi, guys.

990
00:57:26,213 --> 00:57:27,682
- How are you?
- Great.

991
00:57:27,715 --> 00:57:29,482
-Is everything all right here?
-Mm-hmm.

992
00:57:29,517 --> 00:57:31,185
He's not eating his food.
Can I get you something else?

993
00:57:31,218 --> 00:57:32,987
No.
His appetite comes and goes.

994
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,622
Mm-hmm.
Okay, as long as--

995
00:57:34,655 --> 00:57:36,090
We might get it to go
when we leave,

996
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:37,858
- but I will let you know.
- Okay. Yeah.

997
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:39,026
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah.

998
00:57:48,936 --> 00:57:50,204
I lost one of my men.

999
00:57:53,574 --> 00:57:56,610
I broke off from my team
with another guy

1000
00:57:56,644 --> 00:57:57,878
to investigate a building.

1001
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,516
I spot my gunnery sergeant
insisted wasn't safe.

1002
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:03,617
But...

1003
00:58:05,252 --> 00:58:06,554
I knew better.

1004
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:10,891
We got pinned down
by the enemy

1005
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:12,126
as we were coming out.

1006
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:15,563
And my team
had to come back for us.

1007
00:58:19,934 --> 00:58:22,636
My gunnery sergeant
was killed trying to save me.

1008
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:33,614
That's...

1009
00:58:34,749 --> 00:58:37,018
I don't know shit about--
shit about war, but, like...

1010
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:40,254
That's what happens, right?

1011
00:58:40,988 --> 00:58:42,823
Like, you would have
gone back for him, too.

1012
00:58:46,093 --> 00:58:47,528
We were looking for money.

1013
00:58:51,232 --> 00:58:52,867
Jordy,
the guy I was with,

1014
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,569
got a tip from a local,
that the Taliban stashed

1015
00:58:55,603 --> 00:58:57,104
a bunch of cash
in the apartment.

1016
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,775
We went to collect it.

1017
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:04,211
The whole platoon knew.

1018
00:59:04,912 --> 00:59:06,714
Everybody
was gonna get a share.

1019
00:59:09,283 --> 00:59:11,619
There was only one guy
who didn't wanna do it.

1020
00:59:14,722 --> 00:59:16,190
-Your gun guy.
-My gun guy.

1021
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,728
Bobby.

1022
00:59:22,797 --> 00:59:23,898
Kayla's dad.

1023
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:29,003
Stupid fuck put himself
in front of my bullet.

1024
00:59:34,942 --> 00:59:36,077
You can't blame
yourself for that.

1025
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,278
Yes, I can.

1026
00:59:38,746 --> 00:59:39,980
Tell me about you and AJ.

1027
00:59:47,254 --> 00:59:48,889
Nice move.

1028
00:59:48,923 --> 00:59:50,724
You give me your tragic
war story and then--

1029
00:59:51,392 --> 00:59:53,094
I have to tell you
whatever it is you ask,

1030
00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:55,029
otherwise
I'm a total bitch, yeah?

1031
00:59:56,297 --> 00:59:57,798
Yeah.

1032
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,738
-Fuck no.
-A few weeks.

1033
01:00:07,174 --> 01:00:08,642
Give it to Jordy.

1034
01:00:10,377 --> 01:00:12,213
Fuck.

1035
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,315
Give me the dog.

1036
01:00:17,852 --> 01:00:19,186
So, uh...

1037
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,721
Everything you need
is in here.

1038
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:24,191
I need your rifle.

1039
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:27,728
-Trouble?
-No.

1040
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:29,396
Maybe.

1041
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:31,732
I'm helping someone.

1042
01:00:32,266 --> 01:00:34,101
You need some help
helping someone?

1043
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,139
You're a big man,
but you're out of shape.

1044
01:00:38,607 --> 01:00:41,208
And for me,
it's a full time job.

1045
01:00:41,242 --> 01:00:42,977
So behave yourself.

1046
01:00:44,845 --> 01:00:46,914
See you.

1047
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:50,718
Seriously.

1048
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,655
I'm good.

1049
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:57,124
You need the scope?

1050
01:00:58,058 --> 01:01:01,028
Thai food is, like,
the perfect delivery food.

1051
01:01:01,428 --> 01:01:03,030
And we haven't gotten it once.

1052
01:01:03,063 --> 01:01:04,431
We've gotten pizza,
we've gotten Chinese.

1053
01:01:04,465 --> 01:01:06,033
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1054
01:01:08,068 --> 01:01:09,270
I like Thai food,
too, though.

1055
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,072
For me, the-- the top
deliveries would be--

1056
01:01:12,106 --> 01:01:16,177
It'd go: Thai, pizza,
sushi, and Chinese.

1057
01:01:18,479 --> 01:01:19,880
- Mexican.
- Mm-hmm.

1058
01:01:19,914 --> 01:01:21,081
-Italian.
-Wow.

1059
01:01:22,149 --> 01:01:23,751
-For delivery?
-Mexican.

1060
01:01:23,784 --> 01:01:25,319
- Okay.
- Italian.

1061
01:01:26,787 --> 01:01:29,023
Chinese-- sorry.

1062
01:01:29,056 --> 01:01:32,393
Mexican, Chinese,
Italian, Thai...

1063
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:35,229
Jamaican.

1064
01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:39,266
I've never ordered Jamaican.

1065
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:42,203
I can tell.

1066
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:50,844
What's up?

1067
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:08,429
Why'd you guys get so quiet?

1068
01:02:11,198 --> 01:02:12,466
Just finished
the blitz.

1069
01:02:16,437 --> 01:02:17,972
Find the phone.
Find the phone.

1070
01:02:18,005 --> 01:02:19,173
Okay. Okay.

1071
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:22,409
Okay. I got it.
Hey, it's right here.

1072
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:25,479
I've never seen you
do one of these calls,

1073
01:02:25,513 --> 01:02:27,414
so I don't actually know
how it normally goes.

1074
01:02:27,948 --> 01:02:30,150
But if I see an eyebrow raise
that I don't like...

1075
01:02:30,652 --> 01:02:32,820
a bullet
goes into your skull.

1076
01:02:33,187 --> 01:02:34,255
Okay.

1077
01:02:34,288 --> 01:02:36,223
And your mom, Diane,

1078
01:02:36,257 --> 01:02:37,925
she gets the same
by midnight.

1079
01:02:38,727 --> 01:02:41,028
Okay. All right.
But I gotta get this right now.

1080
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:43,197
Go.

1081
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,332
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, can you talk?</i>

1082
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,901
Yeah.

1083
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:50,371
<i>We're doing Victory</i>
<i>Reserve. Remember?</i>

1084
01:02:50,404 --> 01:02:51,939
I remember.

1085
01:02:51,972 --> 01:02:53,340
It's the same spot
that I dropped off,

1086
01:02:53,374 --> 01:02:55,309
uh, two drop offs ago.

1087
01:02:55,342 --> 01:02:57,244
<i>Right, all the way</i>
<i>down the dirt road up there.</i>

1088
01:02:57,278 --> 01:02:58,846
Uh-huh.

1089
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:00,414
After the second exit.
Right. Okay. Okay.

1090
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:02,816
<i>Uh-huh.</i>
<i>The usual drop off drive.</i>

1091
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,318
- Okay.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1092
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:05,886
- I understand.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1093
01:03:05,919 --> 01:03:07,054
Thanks.

1094
01:03:07,555 --> 01:03:08,989
Okay,
they're gonna send a text

1095
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:11,458
with the name,
uh, schedule,

1096
01:03:11,492 --> 01:03:13,160
and personal information,
all right?

1097
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:14,261
Just in a few seconds.

1098
01:03:14,928 --> 01:03:16,330
It'll just take
a few seconds.

1099
01:03:23,571 --> 01:03:26,040
-Literally, a few seconds--
-Maybe up to a minute.

1100
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:41,589
Bianca.

1101
01:03:42,256 --> 01:03:44,358
A 12-year-old,
who apparently likes

1102
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:46,360
female singer-songwriters.

1103
01:03:52,299 --> 01:03:53,967
Hey, come here for a second.

1104
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:05,479
We can't actually do this.

1105
01:04:08,616 --> 01:04:10,017
I'm calling it off.

1106
01:04:13,521 --> 01:04:15,155
Are we actually
gonna watch...

1107
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:18,593
this guy kidnap
some other scared little girl

1108
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:20,160
and gives her
to fuck knows who?

1109
01:04:30,505 --> 01:04:31,606
No, we're not.

1110
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:36,143
Okay.

1111
01:04:39,947 --> 01:04:41,048
I'm going to help him.

1112
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:08,543
Shit.

1113
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:22,489
The tracker's working.

1114
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:28,696
<i>Stay back about half a mile</i>

1115
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:30,565
<i>In case they're watching.</i>

1116
01:05:30,598 --> 01:05:31,666
<i>The tracker will lead us</i>
<i>wherever they're taking her.</i>

1117
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:33,300
Okay.

1118
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:35,002
<i>I know</i>
<i>we're chasing Sophia,</i>

1119
01:05:35,035 --> 01:05:37,104
<i>but we put Bianca</i>
<i>in that van.</i>

1120
01:05:37,672 --> 01:05:40,374
<i>Keeping that girl alive</i>
<i>is our number one priority.</i>

1121
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:29,524
Bianca? I'm Graham.

1122
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,593
My friends
call me Gray-Gray.

1123
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,528
Hey,
it's gonna be all right.

1124
01:06:33,561 --> 01:06:34,796
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1125
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:36,396
Stop it! No!

1126
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,165
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1127
01:06:40,133 --> 01:06:42,402
No one's gonna hurt you.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1128
01:06:42,436 --> 01:06:44,238
No one's gonna hurt you.
It's gonna be all right.

1129
01:06:44,271 --> 01:06:45,372
Stop! No!

1130
01:06:45,405 --> 01:06:46,774
It's gonna be all right.

1131
01:06:46,808 --> 01:06:48,442
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1132
01:06:48,475 --> 01:06:50,645
Yes, yes. Lock it!

1133
01:07:02,155 --> 01:07:03,357
AJ, follow the tracker.

1134
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:13,066
Where's AJ?

1135
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:16,236
Don't turn around.

1136
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:19,541
Where's AJ?

1137
01:07:19,574 --> 01:07:20,842
Don't fucking turn around.

1138
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:22,577
You're not gonna
shoot me in the back.

1139
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,444
If I run, you're not gonna
shoot me in the back.

1140
01:07:26,814 --> 01:07:29,349
My name is Nathan!
My name is Nathan!

1141
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:55,810
No.

1142
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:20,868
Okay, let's go over
the plan again.

1143
01:08:21,536 --> 01:08:22,770
Um...

1144
01:08:22,804 --> 01:08:25,172
I approach
the larger cabin.

1145
01:08:25,205 --> 01:08:26,774
While I cover
the lower end of the house.

1146
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:28,643
And I move in
to breach the smaller cabin

1147
01:08:28,676 --> 01:08:30,812
where we believe the girls
are being kept and free them.

1148
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:32,547
I bullshit my way
into the house--

1149
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:33,648
Hold up.

1150
01:08:35,817 --> 01:08:36,884
Who's this?

1151
01:08:42,356 --> 01:08:43,891
- Hey.
- Hey.

1152
01:08:44,559 --> 01:08:45,693
How are you?

1153
01:08:46,728 --> 01:08:47,929
Holy shit.

1154
01:08:58,973 --> 01:09:00,908
LT.

1155
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,378
That was Sophia's
grief counselor

1156
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:05,647
when my aunt passed away.

1157
01:09:08,248 --> 01:09:11,351
I've met her. I-- I know her.
I can't go in that cabin.

1158
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,221
We have to swap.
You go into the ca--

1159
01:09:14,254 --> 01:09:15,623
She was
Kayla's therapist, too.

1160
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:28,903
I met her too.

1161
01:09:54,428 --> 01:09:55,495
How are you doing?

1162
01:09:56,698 --> 01:09:57,765
Hey, there.

1163
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:00,400
It's okay
I step on your property?

1164
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,839
Uh, I mean, technically,
you already have.

1165
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:06,306
We own everything
up to the road.

1166
01:10:06,339 --> 01:10:07,608
Oh. Oh, really? Okay, I'm--

1167
01:10:08,408 --> 01:10:10,210
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to trespass.

1168
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:14,549
-Oh, sorry.
-It's okay, I get it.

1169
01:10:14,582 --> 01:10:16,784
Uh, so, I broke down.

1170
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:19,453
My phone's dead
and I really need to charge it.

1171
01:10:19,486 --> 01:10:21,756
I'd just really
like to call AAA.

1172
01:10:21,789 --> 01:10:22,990
Is that something
we could do?

1173
01:10:24,726 --> 01:10:27,327
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Is that possible?

1174
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,763
Thank you so much,
I appreciate that.

1175
01:10:28,796 --> 01:10:30,230
Maybe just
let me see if, uh...

1176
01:10:31,298 --> 01:10:32,567
we, um--

1177
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,835
So, where did you
say the car was, though?

1178
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:36,838
Uh, to-- up the road?
The bigger lake?

1179
01:10:36,871 --> 01:10:39,339
-To the left or the right?
-To the left.

1180
01:10:40,074 --> 01:10:41,976
- The left. Walking that way.
- Okay.

1181
01:10:42,009 --> 01:10:43,911
Yeah, I guess
I'm just not exactly sure

1182
01:10:43,945 --> 01:10:45,546
where that was,
but, I mean, maybe we can--

1183
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,748
- Hi.
- Hey.

1184
01:10:46,781 --> 01:10:49,650
- Hey.
- Hi. Hello. Hi.

1185
01:10:50,785 --> 01:10:52,053
- Your car broke down?
- Uh, yes.

1186
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:53,353
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1187
01:10:53,386 --> 01:10:54,789
Um, well,
we can help you.

1188
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:56,724
Thank you so much.
I-- I appreciate that.

1189
01:10:57,558 --> 01:10:58,693
I'm Alex.

1190
01:10:59,292 --> 01:11:00,762
How are you doing, Alex?
It's AJ.

1191
01:11:00,795 --> 01:11:02,462
- AJ. Okay.
- Yeah.

1192
01:11:02,496 --> 01:11:04,999
Well, hi.
Welcome to our humble home.

1193
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:07,769
It's not a lot,
but it's ours, so.

1194
01:11:21,582 --> 01:11:22,784
- AJ.
- Mm-hmm.

1195
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:26,386
-What does that stand for?
-Ooh. Nope. Not telling.

1196
01:11:26,419 --> 01:11:27,655
- You're not telling?
- No.

1197
01:11:28,222 --> 01:11:30,658
Really?
So it's that bad, huh?

1198
01:11:30,691 --> 01:11:31,859
That bad, yeah.

1199
01:11:32,794 --> 01:11:35,362
- Like Amadeus or something?
- Nah.

1200
01:11:35,395 --> 01:11:37,565
- No?
- Yeah. Is that a name?

1201
01:11:37,999 --> 01:11:40,101
I don't know, you tell me.

1202
01:11:40,134 --> 01:11:41,836
Yeah, it kind of
triggers some trauma.

1203
01:11:41,869 --> 01:11:43,370
- Oh.
- I was bullied as a kid.

1204
01:11:43,403 --> 01:11:45,072
Believe it or not.

1205
01:11:45,106 --> 01:11:47,041
I-- I'm sorry to roll up
on you guys like this.

1206
01:11:47,074 --> 01:11:48,843
No! It's fine. Sorry.

1207
01:11:48,876 --> 01:11:50,778
No, we're just--
we're not used to people,

1208
01:11:50,812 --> 01:11:52,980
you know,
rolling up on us, so...

1209
01:11:56,617 --> 01:11:59,620
Um, did somebody
offer you some water?

1210
01:11:59,654 --> 01:12:00,922
- No, no.
- Tim.

1211
01:12:00,955 --> 01:12:02,757
he just walked up
from the-- the lake.

1212
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:04,125
- Go get him something to drink.
- Yep.

1213
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:05,760
- Water would be fine.
- Okay.

1214
01:12:05,793 --> 01:12:07,562
And also, is it possible
I could use the restroom?

1215
01:12:07,595 --> 01:12:09,462
- Of course. Yeah, let's go.
- Right. Thank you.

1216
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:12,800
Um, once you smell
Graham's chicken wings,

1217
01:12:12,834 --> 01:12:14,702
we're not gonna be able
to get rid of you, so--

1218
01:12:14,735 --> 01:12:16,838
- Okay, okay.
- Just letting you know,

1219
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:18,371
- I'm interested in that.
- All right.

1220
01:14:10,818 --> 01:14:11,953
Is it charging?

1221
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,588
Yeah.

1222
01:14:17,925 --> 01:14:18,993
It's not the first time.

1223
01:14:20,227 --> 01:14:21,494
Hold on a sec.

1224
01:14:22,997 --> 01:14:25,566
Should we do some
quick intros while we...

1225
01:14:26,701 --> 01:14:28,803
- wait for your phone?
- Yeah, sure.

1226
01:14:28,836 --> 01:14:31,706
Yeah? So that's Tim.

1227
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:33,207
- who you met outside.
- Right.

1228
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,576
That behind you is Graham.

1229
01:14:37,411 --> 01:14:39,714
I like to call him
Gray-Gray for short.

1230
01:14:39,747 --> 01:14:41,182
Gray-Gray.

1231
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:43,150
But that's a long story
for another day.

1232
01:14:43,184 --> 01:14:45,920
Uh, Beau's the one
who you can hear on the phone.

1233
01:14:45,953 --> 01:14:47,054
How's it going?

1234
01:14:50,591 --> 01:14:51,726
And then this one.

1235
01:14:54,228 --> 01:14:55,495
Dan.

1236
01:14:57,965 --> 01:15:00,067
I like to call him
Danny the Heartbreaker.

1237
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:02,937
Just because
he's really hot.

1238
01:15:04,905 --> 01:15:05,973
Yeah.

1239
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:07,041
We know AJ's...

1240
01:15:08,342 --> 01:15:10,745
not going to tell us what
his name stands for.

1241
01:15:10,778 --> 01:15:12,079
Are you?

1242
01:15:13,914 --> 01:15:14,982
Still keeping that?

1243
01:15:17,084 --> 01:15:18,686
Still close to the vest
with that one.

1244
01:15:19,086 --> 01:15:20,154
Is it Andy?

1245
01:15:22,289 --> 01:15:24,925
No. No, it's not.

1246
01:15:25,993 --> 01:15:28,029
Andy Jerome?

1247
01:15:28,062 --> 01:15:30,164
- No, but I like it.
- Is it Jerome?

1248
01:15:30,197 --> 01:15:31,766
No. No.

1249
01:15:31,799 --> 01:15:33,768
Arthur Jacob?
Like that, Arthur Jacob?

1250
01:15:33,801 --> 01:15:35,236
Mm-mmm. No.

1251
01:15:36,103 --> 01:15:37,138
Andrew Jackson?

1252
01:15:37,772 --> 01:15:40,107
No.
That's not it at all.

1253
01:15:40,141 --> 01:15:41,742
- Not even close?
- No.

1254
01:15:41,776 --> 01:15:42,843
You like him?

1255
01:15:42,877 --> 01:15:44,712
No, no, no.

1256
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:46,313
You don't like Andrew Jackson,
the president?

1257
01:15:46,347 --> 01:15:47,615
No.

1258
01:15:48,983 --> 01:15:50,251
Antonio Jose?

1259
01:15:50,918 --> 01:15:52,186
At least
we're getting more cultural

1260
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:53,954
with the guesses now.

1261
01:15:54,722 --> 01:15:55,856
Gray-gray.

1262
01:15:58,259 --> 01:16:00,094
- Is this not--
- Armand?

1263
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:02,196
Is it an "Ar"?
Is it "Ar"?

1264
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:04,031
Is it "Ar" word?
Like Arthur?

1265
01:16:04,465 --> 01:16:05,933
- Arl?
- Arl?

1266
01:16:05,966 --> 01:16:07,234
You've never heard of Arl?

1267
01:16:08,335 --> 01:16:09,670
-Are you serious?
-No. Who is it?

1268
01:16:09,703 --> 01:16:11,605
- Aaron?
- No.

1269
01:16:12,373 --> 01:16:14,742
Adam? Abel?

1270
01:16:16,177 --> 01:16:17,244
Abraham?

1271
01:16:18,846 --> 01:16:20,114
- Is he just gonna keep--
- Arthur?

1272
01:16:21,348 --> 01:16:23,350
- I'll never tell.
- Arthur? Arthur?

1273
01:16:24,051 --> 01:16:25,686
- I'm not gonna--
- Hey.

1274
01:16:25,719 --> 01:16:27,021
What?

1275
01:16:27,054 --> 01:16:28,289
I said Arthur
and you looked at me.

1276
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:29,857
My name's not Arthur.

1277
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:32,693
It's-- it's not Arthur,
so, uh--

1278
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:35,629
Gray-Gray.

1279
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:38,232
- It's Arthur, all right?
- Okay.

1280
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:40,868
-It's Arthur. It's Arthur.
-This is bullshit.

1281
01:16:41,302 --> 01:16:42,603
Fair.

1282
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:44,371
Your name's Arthur.

1283
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:49,376
Just kidding.

1284
01:16:51,445 --> 01:16:52,980
My name's not Arthur!

1285
01:17:10,231 --> 01:17:11,365
It's okay.

1286
01:17:11,398 --> 01:17:12,700
It's okay. It's okay.

1287
01:17:29,283 --> 01:17:32,086
You're okay. You're okay.

1288
01:17:35,789 --> 01:17:36,924
Who are you?

1289
01:17:37,592 --> 01:17:39,026
We're here to take you home.

1290
01:17:39,059 --> 01:17:40,227
Where's Graham?

1291
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:51,172
Where is--

1292
01:17:51,205 --> 01:17:53,174
Just be quiet, please.

1293
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:00,347
God, you're so dirty.

1294
01:18:00,814 --> 01:18:02,283
- Graham!
- No, no, no.

1295
01:18:02,316 --> 01:18:04,084
We don't want them
to hear--

1296
01:18:04,118 --> 01:18:05,920
-What the hell are you doing?
-She was gonna scream.

1297
01:18:05,953 --> 01:18:07,288
Yeah, no shit.

1298
01:18:07,321 --> 01:18:08,889
Do you want
something else to drink?

1299
01:18:08,923 --> 01:18:10,891
No, water's fine.
I'm good, actually.

1300
01:18:10,925 --> 01:18:12,293
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1301
01:18:12,326 --> 01:18:13,794
Um, you know what?

1302
01:18:14,461 --> 01:18:17,231
I'm going to try
and make this call.

1303
01:18:17,264 --> 01:18:18,966
I think I'm at 5%.
It should be enough, right?

1304
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:20,334
To reach out.

1305
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:22,036
You know what?
He makes amazing wings.

1306
01:18:22,069 --> 01:18:23,404
The ones I was
telling you about outside.

1307
01:18:23,437 --> 01:18:25,105
- Okay. Gotcha.
- Yeah.

1308
01:18:25,139 --> 01:18:27,875
Did you-- are there
any left from lunch?

1309
01:18:27,908 --> 01:18:30,044
- Oh, yeah.
- You want some?

1310
01:18:31,312 --> 01:18:32,980
Uh, I'm-- I'm all right.

1311
01:18:33,013 --> 01:18:34,315
These are really,
really great wings.

1312
01:18:34,348 --> 01:18:36,951
I-- I appreciate it.
Uh, you know.

1313
01:18:36,984 --> 01:18:39,186
Maybe later, but no,
I'm-- I'm good right now.

1314
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,222
- You're good?
- I didn't eat that long ago.

1315
01:18:41,255 --> 01:18:42,323
You know?

1316
01:18:43,924 --> 01:18:45,259
Okay.

1317
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:46,894
You're not gonna scream,
are you?

1318
01:18:48,329 --> 01:18:49,930
No?

1319
01:18:49,964 --> 01:18:51,165
See, he is actually
one of the good guys.

1320
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:53,200
He's just
in a very good disguise.

1321
01:18:53,602 --> 01:18:56,503
We don't want the bad man
to hear us, do we?

1322
01:18:59,206 --> 01:19:01,041
- Okay. Not gonna scream.
- Okay.

1323
01:19:01,676 --> 01:19:03,210
- No.
- No. Great.

1324
01:19:03,244 --> 01:19:05,879
Okay, great.

1325
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:08,415
That's better, right?
Hi. What's your name?

1326
01:19:08,983 --> 01:19:12,086
-Phoebe.
-Phoebe. I'm Lola.

1327
01:19:12,119 --> 01:19:13,521
Okay, we're here
to get you out of here.

1328
01:19:13,555 --> 01:19:16,390
- Where's Graham?
- Who's Graham?

1329
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:19,893
He's Graham.

1330
01:19:21,996 --> 01:19:23,063
Okay.

1331
01:19:23,598 --> 01:19:25,065
We're gonna
get you guys out of here

1332
01:19:25,099 --> 01:19:26,400
and I need your help.

1333
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:27,468
But Graham
hasn't done his trick yet.

1334
01:19:28,168 --> 01:19:30,104
-His trick?
-Yeah, I ate my lunch.

1335
01:19:30,137 --> 01:19:32,507
I did my whole workbook.
He has to do his trick.

1336
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:33,841
What's the trick?

1337
01:19:34,341 --> 01:19:37,077
It's always a surprise.
Obviously.

1338
01:19:38,879 --> 01:19:41,181
Graham's amazing.
You'll love him.

1339
01:19:41,215 --> 01:19:42,850
Graham sounds really great,
but we gotta go.

1340
01:19:43,317 --> 01:19:44,586
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay, you know what?

1341
01:19:44,619 --> 01:19:45,886
Um...

1342
01:19:46,554 --> 01:19:49,290
5% should be enough
to make a call.

1343
01:19:49,323 --> 01:19:50,924
Then I'll get out
of your guys' hair.

1344
01:19:51,526 --> 01:19:53,160
I'll call AAA
in a little bit.

1345
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:54,261
Listen.

1346
01:19:55,296 --> 01:19:57,498
I think that
you eat the wings,

1347
01:19:57,532 --> 01:20:00,000
and then Dan
will drive you to your car

1348
01:20:00,034 --> 01:20:01,802
and he'll fix it for you.

1349
01:20:04,606 --> 01:20:06,440
- He's a great mechanic.
- He could fix anything.

1350
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:08,108
Anything.

1351
01:20:08,842 --> 01:20:10,512
And then
it won't cost you any money.

1352
01:20:10,545 --> 01:20:12,046
It's easy.

1353
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:13,515
Um, I don't want to be
too much trouble.

1354
01:20:13,548 --> 01:20:15,349
Honestly,
too much trouble would be

1355
01:20:15,382 --> 01:20:18,185
not letting this one
show you his skills.

1356
01:20:19,186 --> 01:20:20,387
He likes a little applause.

1357
01:20:20,421 --> 01:20:22,122
- Don't we all?
- Mm.

1358
01:20:26,327 --> 01:20:29,029
Would it offend you
if I-- if I pass?

1359
01:20:29,063 --> 01:20:31,365
Um, it's not that I don't trust
you with my car, it's just--

1360
01:20:31,398 --> 01:20:32,499
There is no car.

1361
01:20:34,401 --> 01:20:35,836
What?

1362
01:20:37,605 --> 01:20:39,306
Okay-- whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

1363
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,141
Hey, hey.
Are you okay?

1364
01:20:42,577 --> 01:20:43,877
Hey, Soph?

1365
01:20:44,978 --> 01:20:46,581
Soph?

1366
01:20:46,614 --> 01:20:47,881
Am I right?

1367
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:50,117
You didn't break down.

1368
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,088
Did you?

1369
01:21:00,994 --> 01:21:02,062
No?

1370
01:21:04,498 --> 01:21:05,633
Abraham?

1371
01:21:06,568 --> 01:21:09,604
Honest Abe? Honest Abe!

1372
01:21:09,637 --> 01:21:10,938
Are you Honest Abe?

1373
01:21:11,405 --> 01:21:12,674
What's wrong with her?

1374
01:21:12,707 --> 01:21:14,108
They drug you
the first few weeks,

1375
01:21:14,141 --> 01:21:15,275
so you get
used to being here.

1376
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:17,478
Then they stop,
so you can learn.

1377
01:21:17,512 --> 01:21:18,979
What do they make you learn?

1378
01:21:19,012 --> 01:21:20,548
I'm learning
how to speak Russian.

1379
01:21:20,582 --> 01:21:21,949
It's really hard.

1380
01:21:22,717 --> 01:21:24,218
That's why I'm still here.

1381
01:21:24,251 --> 01:21:26,320
We can't leave
until we get it perfect.

1382
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:29,990
- Are you Honest Abe?
- Why do you lie?

1383
01:21:33,628 --> 01:21:34,895
It's embarrassing.

1384
01:21:36,497 --> 01:21:38,098
It's okay, tell us.

1385
01:21:51,513 --> 01:21:53,080
I, uh--

1386
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:58,285
So, I didn't-- I didn't come
out here by myself.

1387
01:21:58,318 --> 01:21:59,554
-I--
-You didn't?

1388
01:22:01,589 --> 01:22:03,457
-Who did you come with?
-My girlfriend.

1389
01:22:06,059 --> 01:22:08,262
Whose clothes are these?
Do they dress you up like this?

1390
01:22:08,295 --> 01:22:09,597
Except on photo day.

1391
01:22:10,998 --> 01:22:12,433
Wha-- what's photo day?

1392
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,270
It's when they make us
dress up and do our hair.

1393
01:22:16,303 --> 01:22:18,272
-Time to go.
-Okay.

1394
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:20,374
Okay, come on Soph.

1395
01:22:20,407 --> 01:22:21,408
We were at the lake...

1396
01:22:23,043 --> 01:22:26,714
but then we--
we got into it as we do.

1397
01:22:28,115 --> 01:22:29,316
About marriage.

1398
01:22:31,251 --> 01:22:32,386
Um...

1399
01:22:33,253 --> 01:22:34,722
she got mad,

1400
01:22:34,756 --> 01:22:37,191
yelled at me,
got in the car,

1401
01:22:37,224 --> 01:22:38,992
drove off,
left me stranded.

1402
01:22:40,194 --> 01:22:41,261
Phone was dead.

1403
01:22:42,296 --> 01:22:44,666
Wanted to charge it
so I could call my brother,

1404
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:46,133
get back to the city.

1405
01:22:47,535 --> 01:22:49,002
Not my type
of scenery here.

1406
01:22:54,676 --> 01:22:57,545
Okay, ready?
Do you have what you need?

1407
01:22:58,178 --> 01:22:59,714
- Easy--
- Where'd you get this?

1408
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,349
-It's mine.
-This is Kayla's coat.

1409
01:23:02,382 --> 01:23:04,084
- Hey. Hey!
- This is Kayla's coat.

1410
01:23:04,117 --> 01:23:05,486
What are you doing?
Stop it!

1411
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:10,057
I don't buy it.

1412
01:23:16,363 --> 01:23:18,031
You're not calling
your brother.

1413
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:23,738
You're calling
your girlfriend.

1414
01:23:30,745 --> 01:23:32,446
Let go of me!

1415
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:34,248
- It's Kayla's coat!
- You're scaring her!

1416
01:23:34,281 --> 01:23:36,483
- You're scaring her, LT, okay?
- They hurt her.

1417
01:23:36,518 --> 01:23:38,318
You just scared
the shit out of her.

1418
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:39,754
This is--
this is Kayla's.

1419
01:23:39,787 --> 01:23:42,122
Okay. I need you
to take them-- I know.

1420
01:23:42,155 --> 01:23:44,057
- Did I nail it?
- You are right.

1421
01:23:44,091 --> 01:23:46,393
I am calling my girlfriend

1422
01:23:46,426 --> 01:23:48,295
who left me here
stranded in the woods.

1423
01:23:50,765 --> 01:23:53,267
Just wanted to smooth
things over before I got home.

1424
01:23:55,135 --> 01:23:56,270
Yeah.

1425
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:58,806
LT, we have to
get them out of here.

1426
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,241
Did you know her?
What did they make her learn?

1427
01:24:01,275 --> 01:24:02,777
Hey, we have to
get them out of here.

1428
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:04,278
Hey.

1429
01:24:05,078 --> 01:24:06,848
Why don't you
show them the trick?

1430
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:08,415
- Now?
- Yes, now.

1431
01:24:08,983 --> 01:24:11,318
I couldn't possibly.
I'm too shy.

1432
01:24:11,351 --> 01:24:13,353
Okay. All right.
You talked me into it.

1433
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:25,365
Mix them up really good.

1434
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:27,467
Okay, and then
I want you to reach in

1435
01:24:27,501 --> 01:24:29,303
and just take
any old card you want.

1436
01:24:29,336 --> 01:24:32,774
Doesn't matter.
Does not matter at all.

1437
01:24:33,741 --> 01:24:36,511
Okay? Let everybody see it.
I don't want to see it.

1438
01:24:36,544 --> 01:24:38,145
Mix them all up.

1439
01:24:38,178 --> 01:24:40,213
You can see it.
I don't see it. All right.

1440
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:41,281
Did they hurt her?

1441
01:24:42,382 --> 01:24:43,785
Just-- please,
tell me, just--

1442
01:24:43,818 --> 01:24:44,886
Okay, we'll ask her
all this later, okay?

1443
01:24:44,919 --> 01:24:46,453
We gotta get out of here.

1444
01:24:46,486 --> 01:24:47,822
Put it back somewhere.
Anywhere.

1445
01:24:48,188 --> 01:24:49,857
-Right in there.
-Oh.

1446
01:24:49,891 --> 01:24:51,659
Yeah, that's good.

1447
01:24:51,693 --> 01:24:53,360
Now hold the cards
in your hand

1448
01:24:53,393 --> 01:24:54,896
and shuffle them up.

1449
01:24:54,929 --> 01:24:56,764
Yeah, just give them
a little shuffle like that.

1450
01:24:56,798 --> 01:24:58,498
I'm not
the best shuffler

1451
01:24:58,533 --> 01:24:59,901
- in the world here.
- Oh, that's great.

1452
01:24:59,934 --> 01:25:01,401
I need you to take
Sophia and Bianca.

1453
01:25:01,435 --> 01:25:02,804
She's not going to
come out--

1454
01:25:02,837 --> 01:25:04,237
-We gotta get out of here.
-Yeah, good idea.

1455
01:25:04,271 --> 01:25:05,439
- Okay.
- Okay.

1456
01:25:05,472 --> 01:25:07,274
Look.
First, with my right.

1457
01:25:08,843 --> 01:25:10,612
Then with my left.

1458
01:25:10,645 --> 01:25:12,614
I just go like this.
And I do a little of that.

1459
01:25:13,014 --> 01:25:15,516
Snap.
Nothing in my hand.

1460
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:17,217
And I reach right in my pocket.

1461
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:19,186
And there is your card.

1462
01:25:20,855 --> 01:25:22,557
- Is he right?
- Get the fuck out of here.

1463
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:25,292
Okay, I got Bianca.
Grab on.

1464
01:25:25,325 --> 01:25:26,393
There you go.

1465
01:25:27,327 --> 01:25:28,529
There you go.

1466
01:25:29,831 --> 01:25:31,298
Where did you learn
to do that?

1467
01:25:32,767 --> 01:25:34,602
- Isn't that weird?
- What the fuck?

1468
01:25:38,606 --> 01:25:39,774
All right, girls.
Let's go.

1469
01:25:54,555 --> 01:25:55,890
Baby, are you okay?

1470
01:25:55,923 --> 01:25:57,391
We have to get out of here
right now, okay?

1471
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,699
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

1472
01:26:04,732 --> 01:26:06,366
You're going
the wrong way, please.

1473
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,502
Phoebe. Please, just come.
Right-- right now!

1474
01:26:08,536 --> 01:26:09,837
I'm not fu--
I'm not messing around.

1475
01:26:09,871 --> 01:26:11,371
Please. Please. Phoebe.

1476
01:26:11,405 --> 01:26:12,740
Go check
on the girls, Graham.

1477
01:26:12,774 --> 01:26:14,509
- No. Tim, you go.
- Okay.

1478
01:26:14,876 --> 01:26:16,778
- Tim, stay.
- Okay.

1479
01:26:16,811 --> 01:26:18,211
Graham, you go.

1480
01:26:24,451 --> 01:26:25,953
Hey, Phoebe.

1481
01:26:25,987 --> 01:26:27,822
Sweetheart, I-- I need you
to come out right now.

1482
01:26:28,656 --> 01:26:30,323
Okay? Come on.

1483
01:26:31,425 --> 01:26:32,527
Come on.

1484
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:35,195
Come on, sweetheart. Okay.

1485
01:26:45,707 --> 01:26:48,208
Phoebe? Sophia?
You guys okay?

1486
01:26:52,814 --> 01:26:54,347
Clean up the fucking body.

1487
01:26:54,381 --> 01:26:55,817
We don't have
any lye in the cabin.

1488
01:26:55,850 --> 01:26:57,585
Yeah, we do.
It's in the basement.

1489
01:26:57,618 --> 01:26:58,886
-Then go get it.
-Guys.

1490
01:27:03,323 --> 01:27:05,425
Amari James, bitch.

1491
01:27:10,965 --> 01:27:12,934
Don't, don't, don't.

1492
01:27:22,309 --> 01:27:23,511
Fuck!

1493
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:44,799
Dr. Alex!

1494
01:27:45,365 --> 01:27:46,466
Dr. Alex!

1495
01:27:57,078 --> 01:27:59,947
Okay, uh...

1496
01:28:16,631 --> 01:28:17,932
The guy had a vest on.

1497
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:19,767
There'll be more coming.

1498
01:28:20,802 --> 01:28:22,402
How could you
let this happen?

1499
01:28:22,804 --> 01:28:24,038
Go get the girls.

1500
01:28:24,071 --> 01:28:25,072
I'll meet you
at the safe house.

1501
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:27,608
Phoebe.

1502
01:28:27,642 --> 01:28:28,910
Phoebe, I need you
to come out right now.

1503
01:28:28,943 --> 01:28:30,343
Phoebe. Right now!

1504
01:28:32,013 --> 01:28:35,382
Hey, hey, hey, it's me.

1505
01:28:36,017 --> 01:28:37,384
It's me.

1506
01:28:39,053 --> 01:28:40,453
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1507
01:28:41,088 --> 01:28:43,057
- Yeah, I'm f-- fine.
- Okay.

1508
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:44,424
Did you hear
those gunshots?

1509
01:28:45,526 --> 01:28:46,794
Okay, listen.

1510
01:28:46,828 --> 01:28:48,461
Just grab her,
take her to the van.

1511
01:28:48,495 --> 01:28:49,831
- I'm gonna go get AJ.
- Okay.

1512
01:28:49,864 --> 01:28:50,932
Come on. Let's go.

1513
01:28:50,965 --> 01:28:52,465
Hey, Phoebe.

1514
01:28:52,499 --> 01:28:53,734
I need you to come
right now, please.

1515
01:28:53,768 --> 01:28:54,936
I'll meet you at the van.

1516
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:20,460
Hey.

1517
01:29:21,696 --> 01:29:23,698
Let me take a wild guess.

1518
01:29:23,731 --> 01:29:24,999
This is the part
where you tell me

1519
01:29:25,032 --> 01:29:26,433
I should walk away right now.

1520
01:29:26,868 --> 01:29:28,636
No, man,
that's not on the table.

1521
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:30,503
I was just gonna ask
if you knew

1522
01:29:30,538 --> 01:29:32,006
if the Knicks were up
at the half?

1523
01:29:35,543 --> 01:29:36,711
I will shoot
these fucking bitches

1524
01:29:36,744 --> 01:29:38,779
if you don't put
the gun down.

1525
01:29:46,453 --> 01:29:47,788
No, no, no.

1526
01:29:59,634 --> 01:30:00,868
How many more of you are there?

1527
01:30:03,804 --> 01:30:04,906
They're all dead.

1528
01:30:05,706 --> 01:30:06,974
Everybody.

1529
01:30:11,112 --> 01:30:12,613
They are.

1530
01:30:12,647 --> 01:30:14,181
My piece of shit boss bailed.

1531
01:30:14,815 --> 01:30:16,584
Left me
to clean up the mess.

1532
01:30:18,753 --> 01:30:20,721
Left you here to die
is what he did.

1533
01:30:28,663 --> 01:30:29,797
Go find our boy.

1534
01:30:36,237 --> 01:30:38,639
- You got her?
- I got her.

1535
01:30:48,516 --> 01:30:49,617
Phoebe?

1536
01:30:51,652 --> 01:30:53,120
It's okay, sweetheart.
Come on out.

1537
01:30:54,822 --> 01:30:56,524
The bad man
can't hurt you anymore.

1538
01:31:05,866 --> 01:31:07,500
I want you to go
outside on the porch.

1539
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:11,872
Cover your ears real tight,
count to 100, okay?

1540
01:31:15,042 --> 01:31:16,110
Okay. Go ahead.

1541
01:31:18,746 --> 01:31:19,914
Close the door behind you.

1542
01:31:31,559 --> 01:31:32,760
Quiz time.

1543
01:31:33,928 --> 01:31:34,996
Sudden death round.

1544
01:31:45,072 --> 01:31:46,173
Yeah, I know her.

1545
01:31:48,209 --> 01:31:49,777
She was a real
pain in the ass.

1546
01:31:51,846 --> 01:31:53,147
Kept trying to escape.

1547
01:32:00,654 --> 01:32:02,056
I fought for my country.

1548
01:32:05,593 --> 01:32:08,129
And this is all my little boy's
gonna remember me by.

1549
01:32:21,609 --> 01:32:23,210
You answer
my next question properly

1550
01:32:23,244 --> 01:32:25,746
and I'll make sure your son
never knows you were here.

1551
01:32:31,052 --> 01:32:32,319
Right inside pocket.

1552
01:32:43,364 --> 01:32:44,632
What's the code?

1553
01:32:45,232 --> 01:32:47,234
0009.

1554
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:51,038
It's under
the file "gardening."

1555
01:33:01,248 --> 01:33:02,917
You still gonna keep
your promise?

1556
01:33:11,025 --> 01:33:12,226
You ready, soldier?

1557
01:33:46,427 --> 01:33:47,962
She's in Johannesburg.

1558
01:33:51,298 --> 01:33:52,366
When do we leave?

1559
01:36:06,534 --> 01:36:09,937
