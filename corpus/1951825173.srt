00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:26,122
Le concierge. Bon soir, monsieur Whitman,
qu'est-ce que vous voudriez?

2
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:30,126
Bon soir, s'il vous plait, je voudrais
un verre de lait au chocolat

3
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:34,088
et soupe d'oignons
et sandwich avec...

4
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,941
How do you say 'grilled cheese'?

5
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,292
<i>Un toast au fromage.</i>

6
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:39,810
Merci, exactement.

7
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:41,979
Merci beaucoup.

8
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:50,655
Hallo.

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,398
<i>Hi.</i>

10
00:00:54,108 --> 00:00:58,062
<i>I'm on my way from the airport and the front
desk won't get me your room number.</i>

11
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:02,033
<i>What's your room number?</i>

12
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:06,243
403.

13
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:07,455
<i>See you in half an hour.</i>

14
00:01:07,497 --> 00:01:09,749
- Wait a second.
<i>- What?</i>

15
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,335
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm here.</i>

16
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:15,087
I didn't say you could come here.

17
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:17,965
<i>Can I come there?</i>

18
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:22,353
OK.

19
00:01:22,378 --> 00:01:24,097
<i>I'll see you in half an hour.</i>

20
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:19,088
What's this music?

21
00:03:43,327 --> 00:03:45,313
How did you find me?

22
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,266
It wasn't actually that hard.

23
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,677
Are you going to take a bath?

24
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:51,512
It's for you.

25
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,334
What got you here?

26
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:00,854
Bar in the lobby.

27
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:20,582
What the fuck is going on?

28
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:33,720
How long have you had
this hotel room?

29
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:36,257
I don't know.

30
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:39,142
More than a week?

31
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:41,462
More than a week.

32
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:44,382
More than a month?

33
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:47,318
More than a month.

34
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:50,438
How much does it cost?

35
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:55,986
I think around 750 million euros
or something.

36
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:01,916
How long are you gonna stay?

37
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:04,660
How long do you wanna stay?

38
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:07,755
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

39
00:06:29,244 --> 00:06:32,780
I think it's time for you to go home.

40
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:35,283
Probably.

41
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:38,778
Are you running away from me?

42
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:42,790
I thought I already did.

43
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:30,504
Would you get me
a bloody mary, please?

44
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:33,658
Two bloody maries, please.

45
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,471
Have you slept with anyone?

46
00:08:40,242 --> 00:08:42,660
No. Have you?

47
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:47,916
No.

48
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:50,609
That was a long pause.

49
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:01,862
- I guess it doesn't really matter.
- No,it doesn't.

50
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:11,615
You got bruises on your body.

51
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:25,753
Whatever happens, man, I don't
wanna lose you as my friend.

52
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:31,918
I promise, I will never
be your friend.

53
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:34,170
No matter what... ever.

54
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:43,105
We fuck and I will
feel like shit tomorrow.

55
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:46,848
That's ok with me.

56
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:06,727
I love you.

57
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:10,064
I never hurt you on purpose.

58
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,418
I don't care.

59
00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:34,055
Wanna see my view of Paris?

60
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:36,149
OK.
