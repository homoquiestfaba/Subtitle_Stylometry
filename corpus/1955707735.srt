00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,205
Hello!

2
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:17,357
Gasoline?

3
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:20,415
Yes. Gasoline.

4
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:34,299
Hey... Where are we going, fellas?

5
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:47,331
Welcome.

6
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,268
...boys.

7
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,294
No more. No more.

8
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,038
No more! No more!

9
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:08,575
No more. No more.

10
00:22:17,582 --> 00:22:19,734
Stop! Stop!

11
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:22,922
Good. Good.

12
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:24,859
Thank you. Thank you.

13
00:28:58,635 --> 00:29:00,650
- Do'nt shoot!
- No.

14
01:32:09,755 --> 01:32:10,829
Let's do it.

15
01:32:11,274 --> 01:32:12,373
Let's do it.

16
01:32:12,756 --> 01:32:13,514
All right?

17
01:32:14,253 --> 01:32:14,920
What?

18
01:32:17,076 --> 01:32:17,881
All right?

19
01:32:21,644 --> 01:32:22,886
All right, Barry?

20
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:26,660
Yes. Yes.

21
01:32:29,938 --> 01:32:30,766
I'm here.

22
01:32:32,626 --> 01:32:33,400
I'm here...

23
01:32:37,267 --> 01:32:39,361
and I brought you Harleys.

24
01:34:13,269 --> 01:34:14,566
- That son of a bitch!

25
01:34:14,591 --> 01:34:15,987
- He betrayed us!

26
01:34:16,012 --> 01:34:17,980
- Pablo, let's take care
of this right away!

27
01:34:18,005 --> 01:34:19,072
- We have to deal
with this immediately!

28
01:34:19,097 --> 01:34:21,214
- Pablo, if we don't take care of
our customers, someone else will!

29
01:45:00,475 --> 01:45:03,256
"SCHAFER" WAS PROMOTED

30
01:45:08,019 --> 01:45:12,878
AFTER BEING RELEASED,
PETE BECAME A PASTOR IN ALABAMA.

31
01:45:16,677 --> 01:45:19,260
THE OTHER PILOTS WERE NOT SEEN AGAIN.

32
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:22,309
THE CIA CONTINUED USING THE
BARRY AIRCRAFTS FOR THE CONTRAS...

33
01:45:25,333 --> 01:45:30,237
UNTIL ONE OF THEM WAS
SHOT DOWN IN NICARAGUA.

34
01:45:33,461 --> 01:45:40,281
THIS BECAME KNOWN AS
THE IRAN-CONTRAS SCANDAL.

35
01:45:55,163 --> 01:45:58,327
LUCE AND THE CHILDREN
WENT BACK TO LOUSIANA.
