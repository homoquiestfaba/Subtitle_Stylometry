You don't remember what you had to eat?

519
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,677
So, dinner wraps up,
and we're standing outside,

520
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,838
-and the husband...
-Arty.

521

(MUSIC STARTS AGAIN)

522
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,983
Arty, he has to make a red eye,

523
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,779
a late flight, that is,
to catch a different race,

524
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,485
and he's leaving the old lady
behind overnight.

525
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,383
-I know where this is going.
-You know it, baby.

526
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,891
She slips me her hotel key.

527
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,019
So I go up to my room
and do a quick brush to the daggers...

528
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,722
Wait. You're in the same hotel?

529

530
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,535

00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,060
-Awesome!
-Awesome!

532
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,666
(MUSIC STARTS AGAIN) So,
I clean up a bit, head over to her spot,

533
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:38,969
I open the door,

534
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:44,006
and there's champagne and chocolates
all laid out on the table,

535
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,878

536
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,382
And I suddenly realize
that I am the prey.

537
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:54,020
-You had no control in the matter?
-No control whatsoever.

(EX CLAIMING)

539
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,216
She pours me a glass of bubbly,

540
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,854
pops a couple chocolates in my mouth,

541
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,198

542
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,968
then she walks into the bathroom.

543
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,294
Just then, the phone rings.

544
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:11,497
I pick it up, and on the other end
of the line is a man's voice.

545
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,769
-No way.
-No way.

546
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,203
And the man says,

547
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,607
"Hello, Brent."

548
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,176
BRENT: Hello, Brent.

549
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,883
-The husband?
-The husband.

550
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,144
It's the freaking husband,

551
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,844

And he tells me this, get this,

00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,044
"Take care of my lady! "

553
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,356

-Balls of fire!

So I say in a nice, cordial way,

"Well, thank you, sir. I will."

557
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:40,198
Then she catwalks out of the bathroom
with leopard lingerie and ears.

-Her blonde locks flowing out underneath.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

To answer that question, I'm surprised
they haven't killed each other.

572
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,268
-It's a hate-hate relationship.
-Huh.

you don't want to get married?
