Let's sit out.
Yeah.

15
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:54,864
How are you, cutie?

16
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:57,533
I'd be doing better without
that cigarette in my face.

17
00:03:57,534 --> 00:03:58,868
Ready for the fight,
champ?

18
00:04:00,304 --> 00:04:03,873
This fight's already over.

19
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:05,875
I love that attitude.

20
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:08,077
Sexy. Keep it up.

21
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,782
Ladies and gentlemen,

22
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:15,818
welcome to our main event,

23
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:18,755
the R.F.C. Heavyweight

24
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:21,824
Championship of the World!

00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:24,994
[crowd cheering]

26
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:30,767
The challenger tonight,
with a record of nine wins
and three losses,

27
00:04:30,768 --> 00:04:32,769
he's an expert in jujitsu
and wrestling,

28
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,071
fighting out of
Mexico City, Mexico,

29
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:40,810
Pedro Hernandez!

[cheering continues]

31
00:04:45,082 --> 00:04:46,449
Coming into the ring next

32
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,887
is the R.F.C. Heavyweight
Champion of the World,

33
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:52,889
standing 6'4",

34
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,859
weighing 250 pounds,

35
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,861
with an outstanding record
of 19 wins

36
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:00,096
and zero losses,

37
00:05:00,097 --> 00:05:03,733
he's a freestyle fighter
out of Ross, Texas,

38
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:08,104
Colin "The Brick" Wahle!

39
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:13,643
[Commentator]
And this is what we've
all been waiting for,

40
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:16,045
the main event--
Colin "The Brick" Wahle

41
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:17,647
against Pedro Hernandez.

42
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:19,649
[Commentator #2]
Wahle has certainly
had a meteoric rise

43
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,150
to the top
of the R.F.C.

44
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:22,886
And that's due
in no small part

45
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:24,287
to his outspoken manager
and owner

46
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:26,789
or Revolution Fight Club,
Victoria Ruolan.

47
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,857
This company's gone
through quite a makeover

48
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:31,960
since she took over
from her father.

49
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:34,296
Fighters, join me
in the center of the ring.

50
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:37,966
I want a clean fight.

51
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:39,435
Keep punches above the belt.

52
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:41,303
If I see any gouging
or hooking,

53
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:42,638
points will be deducted.

54
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,840
Do you understand?

55
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:46,809
Get in your corners.

[Man]
Ten million dollars
a year he's making.

58
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,086
Ten million a year.
And I'm his manager.

59
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:00,456
I'm not really his manager,
but we're like brothers.

Fighters ready?

61
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,194

And we're off to the races.

63
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,666
[Commentator #2]
Pedro's keeping his distance.

64
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,168
He's a big guy,
but Wahle does have

65
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:13,736
a little bit
of a reach advantage.

66
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:15,538
¶ No control,
but I'm excited ¶

¶ Kills the time,
and I can't waste it ¶

68

and I can taste it ¶

¶ The more it hurts,
the more I feed it ¶

¶ Screw the hope,
but I won't make it ¶

72
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:30,653
¶ Hear you scream,
but I can't break it ¶

73
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:34,623
¶ Addict, addict, addict ¶

74
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:37,460
¶ Now you're fucking joking ¶

75
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:42,932
Back it up, Wahle.
Back it up.

76
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:45,802
Do it.
¶ Down so deep
you can't conceive ¶

77
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:48,671
¶ Filled with blood,
the shame is dirt ¶

78
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:51,107
¶ A hundred thousand
bricks won't work ¶

79
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:53,709
¶ God is left,
and he won't see ¶

80
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,345
¶ All that hurts
inside of me ¶

81
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:59,315
¶ Ocean slips
between the cracks ¶

82
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:03,052
¶ Leave my head
out on the tracks ¶

83
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:04,720
Yeah!
[laughs]

84
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:06,889
[Commentator]
Tell me if I'm seeing things,

85
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,724
but it looked like The Brick
just tossed

86
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:11,628
a 225-pound man
around like a rag doll.

87
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:14,297
[Commentator #2]
He's the most devastating
fighter in the cage

88
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:17,700
since Dalton Hunt
and his 21-and-0 record
from five years ago.

Fighters do something.
Let's see something.

91
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:28,744
All right.
Break it up.

92
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:31,413

Pedro's gonna have to do better
than that if he wants the belt.

93
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,883
[Commentator #2]
The belt? Don't you
think he just wants

94
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:35,918
to get out of this
in one piece?

95

I fucking love this shit!

103
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:35,878
Dalton, where you been?

104
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,181
Man, just blowing
my paycheck on groceries.

105
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:42,451
Well, get inside.
You gotta check this out.

106
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:44,286
You're gonna love
this, brother.

107
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,588
What you got?

108
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,194
[Man]
Hey, champ. Champ.
Can I get a moment, please?

109
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:53,963
Amazing fight.

110
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:56,131
Fight?
That wasn't a fight, man.
That was a massacre.

111
00:08:56,132 --> 00:08:58,101
Punk ass.

112
00:08:58,102 --> 00:08:59,535
You're just one win away

113
00:08:59,536 --> 00:09:01,671
from beating Dalton Hunt's
all-time R.F.C. record.

114
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:03,172
How does that feel?

115
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:04,674
Mine.
That record's gonna be mine.

116
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:06,441
He's an old man.
It's in the bag.

[TV off]

118
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:09,344
What do you think
about that?

119
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:13,215
I think I need to put
the milk away before it spoils.

120
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:15,183
That's it?
That's it.

121
00:09:15,184 --> 00:09:16,719
Oh, God.

122
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,654
Come on, Dalton.

123
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:21,223
This could be your chance
to get back in the mix.

124
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:22,892
He's just jawing off.

125
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:24,894
People say all sorts of things
in the heat of the moment.

126
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:26,962
Well, close his jaw
for him.

127
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:29,398
I'm not fighting
anyone, Wyatt.

128
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,300
Why not, man?
Are you scared of him?

129
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:32,535
Huh?

130
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:37,640
Look, don't you have
any clients to punish
down at the gym?

131
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:39,775
I know you don't like
what Victoria is doing
with the league.

132
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:42,144
I get that, okay?
But you and her old man
were tight.

133
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:44,513
Just give her a call.
Not gonna happen.

134
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:47,183
You're telling me
you'd rather work at one
of her construction sites

135
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:49,185
than climb back in the ring?

136
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:52,922
Look, there's nothing wrong
with doing honest work
for an honest paycheck.

137
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:56,192
I completely agree with you.
Dang it.
[phone ringing]

138
00:09:56,193 --> 00:09:57,927
This is Wyatt.

139
00:09:57,928 --> 00:09:59,795
You know what?
I'll be there in five minutes.

140
00:09:59,796 --> 00:10:01,063
Have her
start on the treadmill.

141
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:03,065
I gotta roll to the gym.

142
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:06,435
But at least think about
giving Victoria a call,
all right?

143
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:08,904
Oh, and Elena called, twice.

144
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:11,107
You're the most annoying
roommate ever.

145
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:13,575
Just promise me
you'll at least
think about it, man.

146
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:16,746
I promise I'll at least
think about it.

147
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:21,383
And I'm done
thinking about it.

148
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:05,327
[line ringing]

00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,835
[Man]
What can I do for you,
Miss Ruolan?

150
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:16,372
I have an idea
about the press
we've been looking for.

151
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:18,741
Have the legal department
do some digging

152
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:21,410
into Dalton Hunt's
old contracts.

153
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:23,812
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:25,348
Make it quick.

155
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:27,750
I need it first thing
in the morning.

156
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:29,318
[beeps]

157
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:23,672
Are you avoiding me?

158
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:25,875
What? No.
I mean, I, uh...

159
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:28,510
I thought you
might be asleep.

160
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:31,380
You should come in
and help me get
the little monster to sleep.

161
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:33,582
Yeah.

162
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:39,121
Grace, look who's here.
Who?

163
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,723
Stop the movie
and come here.

164
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:42,091
How are you, angel?

165
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:44,860
Dad!

166
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:47,830
Whoa!

167
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:49,865
Hey, isn't it
past your bedtime?

168
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:52,367
Come on.
Let's get you to sleep.

169
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:55,170
You don't have to carry me.
I'm almost 9, you know.

170
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:57,106
Oh, you're right.

171
00:12:57,107 --> 00:13:00,075

Oh...

172
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:02,677
[Grace]
Up the steps.

173
00:13:05,314 --> 00:13:07,216
Don't you need
to brush your teeth

174
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:10,052
and stuff like that,
hmm?

175
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:12,687
Already done.
Mmm.

176
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:14,422
Do you want a story?

177
00:13:14,423 --> 00:13:15,924
Nah.

178
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:19,294
Is there anything else
I can do?

179
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:24,266
Well, you can be around here
a little bit more.

180
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:27,737
I know.
I've been working a lot.

181
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:31,807
Mom works a lot,
but she's still around.

182
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:35,978
I know, sweetheart.

183
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:38,580
I'll try, okay?

184
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:41,950
I'm tired.

185
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:43,052
Okay.

186
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:47,823
I'll get the lights.

187
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:49,425
Leave them on, okay?

188
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:50,960
Mom will
turn them off later.

189
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:52,594
All right.

190
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:54,263
Good night.

191
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:59,067

All right.
This one up here, champ.

195
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:23,192

Bring it up.

198
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:28,197
There you go, champ.
Come on.

199
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:30,766
Keep it coming.
Piece of cake.

200
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:33,869
Shit. It's all you, baby.

201
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,538
There you go.
Come on.

You've been working out
all fucking day.

Hey, Wahle.
Saw your last match.
Not bad.

Not bad?

Son, you know
who this is?
He's the best.

215
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:23,452
I was just wondering
how you'd do against
a real fighter, champ.

216
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:25,287
Say it like
you mean it, huh?

217
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:27,589
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Walk away, bro. Walk away.

218
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,124
I don't walk away
from anybody.

Yo, Hunt!
Boss is here to see you, man.

Mr. Dalton Hunt,
as I live and breathe.

252
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:12,394
How have you been?

253
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,598
I can't complain.

254
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,899
That's what I like
to hear.

255
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,402
I had my people
do a little digging,

256
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:24,006
and it turns out
you still have one fight
in the contract

257
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:27,109
that you signed
with my father,

258
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,778
and I am here to collect.

259
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:31,746
Your father
said we were even.

260
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:33,915
He said that contract
was no good.

261
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,019
I am running the R.F.C. now.

262
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,721
So you can either
take the fight,

263
00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:42,657
or we can settle this
in court.

264
00:17:44,494 --> 00:17:45,994

265
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:48,631

00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:52,934

268
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:56,204
is that ex-wife--
and kid into their place.

269
00:17:56,205 --> 00:18:00,342
But things can change,
you know?

270
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:03,745
The fight is in two months.

271
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:05,213

00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:07,282

Look what
you're doing, Dalton.

00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:15,557
It can get really
stormy out there

275
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:18,393

you care about.

00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:37,345
I got your message.

00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:38,747
What the hell
is going on here?

281
00:18:38,748 --> 00:18:41,416
The sheriff came to the door
and started banging.

282
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,852
He gave us 30 minutes
to grab what we could,

283
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,554
and now we're out
in the street.

284
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:47,422
Daddy, what's happening?

285
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,924
It's gonna be
all right, angel.

286
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:51,259
It's okay.
I'll be right back.

287
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,595
Come here, baby.

288
00:18:53,596 --> 00:18:55,464
How can you
do this?

289
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:58,667
Well, it seems
that they were living here

290
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:01,603
at the power of discretion
of the house's owner,

291
00:19:01,604 --> 00:19:04,072
a Miss Victoria Ruolan.

292
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:05,240
God damn it!

293
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:10,312
Are we gonna
have a problem?

294
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:12,947
Nah. No problem.

295
00:19:14,116 --> 00:19:16,118
Listen, I'll give you
a few more minutes,

296
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,553
but get it cleared out.

297
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,791
What did he say, Dalton?

298
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:25,960
Did he say something
about Ruolan?

299
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:27,128
What did you do?

300
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:29,665
Stop fighting.

301
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,700
Take care of this,
Dalton.

302
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:33,669
Look, I'll straighten
this out tomorrow.

303
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,071
In the meantime,
you can come stay with me.

304
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:37,439
We can't.

305
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,675
I promise I'll do
what it takes to fix this.

306
00:19:58,127 --> 00:20:00,061
I know it's not great,
but it's all yours.

307
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:05,433
What are you going
to do, Dalton?

308
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:10,172
You don't have any money,
and we can't stay here.

309
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:12,674
It just won't work.

310
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:14,276
[sighs]

311
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:16,978
I know
what I have to do.

312
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:21,115
Please handle this,
Dalton.

313
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:24,118
Grace deserves better.

314
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:27,255
I know.

315
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:30,391
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:43,138
[Victoria]
Any kind of chain is fine.

317
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,440
Just make sure to get
one of those big lots.

318
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:47,242
Never mind.
Just head on back.

319
00:20:47,243 --> 00:20:49,578
[door closes]

320
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:53,114
How are you, Dalton?

321
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:55,050
I'm glad you came by.

322
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:58,120
You didn't have to bring
my family into this.

323
00:20:58,121 --> 00:20:59,354
Come on.

324
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:03,658
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

325
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,606
I'd like to offer you
a drink,

326
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:20,408
but since you're
in training now...

327
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:22,577
What makes you
think that?

328
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:25,013
You're here, after all.

329
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:35,257
Some people say I'm just
playing with my daddy's money--

330
00:21:35,258 --> 00:21:37,893
that I don't deserve
to run the R.F.C.

331
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:39,995
Look, what's your point?

332
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:42,564
My point is
my dad could not have

333
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:44,866
his biggest draw
back into the ring

334
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:46,801
because he did not
have the balls

335
00:21:46,802 --> 00:21:50,339
to do what needed
to be done.

336
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,107
Ironic, huh?

337
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:57,211
Yeah. He had
integrity instead.

338
00:22:00,849 --> 00:22:04,486
I want this to be entertaining,
you know?

339
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:08,456
I want you
to put on a show.

340
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:11,793
Make Wahle look good.

341
00:22:11,794 --> 00:22:14,462
When this is over,

342
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:19,034
you stay away from me,
my family,

343
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:21,436
and my friends.

344
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:24,740
After the fight,

345
00:22:24,741 --> 00:22:27,643
I don't care
what happens to you.

346
00:22:27,644 --> 00:22:30,145
I just need your ass
in the cage

347
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:31,813
in eight weeks.

348
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:34,916
If I'm gonna be training,

349
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,019
I can't work,

350
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,454
so I'll need an advance.

351
00:22:39,455 --> 00:22:41,422
Of course.

352
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:44,559
I'm not stingy.

353
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,696
How's, uh, 20,000?

354
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:52,534
Doesn't matter to me.

355
00:22:52,535 --> 00:22:54,469
I won't miss it.

356
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,441
Anything you need
to get ready for?

357
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:02,811
I don't need anything else
from you.

358
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,446
Sure thing.

359
00:23:10,386 --> 00:23:13,621
It's good to be queen.

360
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,131
Dalton, hey, man.

361
00:23:23,132 --> 00:23:25,834
I've been trying
to let this go,
but it's driving me nuts.

362
00:23:25,835 --> 00:23:28,136
Listen, you got a chance
to get back in the ring--

363
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:29,972
I'm fighting Wahle.

364
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:32,641
Seriously?
That's fantastic, man.

365
00:23:32,642 --> 00:23:35,010
Look, I got no business
getting back in the ring.

366
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:36,845
Yes, you do.

367
00:23:36,846 --> 00:23:39,014
You do, and I got just
the trainer for you, okay?

368
00:23:39,015 --> 00:23:41,049
He's the guy that got me back
into living again.

369
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,384
I'm telling you,
he's exactly what you need.

370
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:45,320
Well, I need all the help
I can get.

371
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:47,389
But right now,
I gotta take care of something.

372
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,390
All right.

373
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:51,893
All right! Yes!

374
00:23:51,894 --> 00:23:54,896
We are back, baby!
We are back in the game!

375
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:57,999
Can you hear me? Whoo!
[mooing]

376
00:24:03,105 --> 00:24:06,441
[car doors close]

377
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:14,382
I got your call.
What's going on?

378
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:17,285
Hi, Daddy.

379
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:19,086
Hey, sweetie.

380
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:21,423
I hope you don't mind,
but I took the liberty

381
00:24:21,424 --> 00:24:23,458
of setting you guys up
in a new place.

382
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,460
[key jingling]

383
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:27,796
Let's go inside.

384
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,467
Are you serious?

385
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:35,102
Yeah. Yeah.

386
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,241
[Elena chuckles]

387
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:08,970
God damn. What the hell's
wrong with you,

388
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:11,006
you fucking piece of shit?

389
00:25:13,408 --> 00:25:15,276
Use the pathway.

390
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:31,827
Uh, Wyatt Hart said

391
00:25:31,828 --> 00:25:34,129
you could help me
get ready for my fight.

392
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,264
You're Dalton, right?

393
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:37,832
Yeah.

394
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:40,334
Wyatt called me about you.

395
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:43,004
Sounds like you're in
a shitload of trouble.

396
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:46,708
Enlighten me.

397
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:50,177
Well, in eight weeks,
I'm stepping into the cage
against Colin Wahle.

398
00:25:52,347 --> 00:25:54,282
That guy's a monster.

399
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:57,852
Who'd you piss off?

400
00:25:57,853 --> 00:26:00,822
I have a fight left on my
contract with the R.F.C.,

401
00:26:00,823 --> 00:26:02,990
and they're pulling me
back in.

402
00:26:02,991 --> 00:26:04,926
Can you get me ready?

403
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:09,030
Physically, yeah.

404
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:11,032
But since you ain't
fought in a while,

405
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:13,034
I'm more concerned
about getting you

406
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:15,069
right up here.

407
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,038
Look, as long as
I survive the fight,

408
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,707
I don't need to do
any soul searching.

409
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,743
Yeah, well, we'll see.

410
00:26:21,744 --> 00:26:26,047
So you ain't fought in,
like, what, five years?

411
00:26:26,048 --> 00:26:27,249
Mmm.

412
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,984
That's a lifetime
in this game.

413
00:26:31,554 --> 00:26:34,522
Look,
if it's a money thing--
Don't need it.

414
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:38,126
No. I'm doing this
as a favor to Wyatt.

415
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:40,761
If you stick with it,
I'll train you.

416
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:44,199
But you need to know that
I do things a little different.

417
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,634
I'm in.

418
00:26:48,904 --> 00:26:50,872
All right, then.

419
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:54,409
I want you to meet me
at a bar called Bull McCabe's,
9:00 tonight.

420
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,977
You know it?
[laughs]

421
00:26:55,978 --> 00:26:57,879
What, we gonna be
pounding some back?

422
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:01,382
In a manner of speaking.

423
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:04,252
All right.
I'll see you then.

424
00:27:04,253 --> 00:27:06,321
[clangs]

425
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:08,957
Use the path,
God damn it.

426
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:17,632
Attagirl.
That's looking good.

All right, guys.

¶ [continues]

431
00:27:30,713 --> 00:27:33,448
Well, this is fun.

432
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:35,417
Ain't supposed
to be fun.

433
00:27:35,418 --> 00:27:37,252
This is training.

434
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:43,558
You know, in Japan,
a fighter in the Valor
Federation

435
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,128
ain't even allowed
anywhere near a bar
before a fight.

436
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:50,098
I never
agreed with that.

437
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:52,800
I think it's good
to cut loose

438
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:55,837
every now and again.

439
00:27:55,838 --> 00:27:58,306
Wait here.

440
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:05,246
Excuse me, gentlemen.

441
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:07,248
Y'all play professional
football, don't you?

442
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:09,650
Damn straight.
Oh, I thought so.

443
00:28:09,651 --> 00:28:11,385
Yeah. 'Cause my friend
over there--

444
00:28:11,386 --> 00:28:13,487
he said he saw the game
on TV last week

445
00:28:13,488 --> 00:28:15,623
and, boy, y'all sucked.

446
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:17,324
What fucking friend?

447
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:20,695
That fella right there
at the bar.

448
00:28:20,696 --> 00:28:23,665
That fucking guy
right there?
Yep.

449
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:25,767
Matter of fact,
he said y'all sucked so bad

450
00:28:25,768 --> 00:28:27,769
that he's pretty sure
he could whip each

451
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,071
and every one of your asses,
starting with you.

452
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:31,806
That fucking guy
right there?
Yeah.

453
00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:35,677
I told him we should just have
some drinks and settle down,
but, mmm...

454
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:37,445
I'll tell y'all what.

455
00:28:37,446 --> 00:28:39,346
Y'all boys
stay right here.

456
00:28:39,347 --> 00:28:41,282
I'm gonna be right back.

457
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:43,217
Let me see what's up.

458
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:47,121
Hey, man, what's your
fucking problem, man?

459
00:28:47,122 --> 00:28:50,024
No problem here.

460
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:53,127
Your buddy down there
says you're talking shit
about my team.

461
00:28:53,128 --> 00:28:55,463
No. He's just
playing around.

462
00:28:55,464 --> 00:28:58,299
See how old he is?
He's completely senile.

463
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,634
Yeah, well, I don't like
fucking jokes, man.

464
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:03,370
Hey, neither do I.
I hate jokes.

465
00:29:03,371 --> 00:29:05,372
I'm just sorry
about the confusion.

466
00:29:05,373 --> 00:29:08,209
Let me buy you guys
a round of drinks.

467
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,512
You know what?
That's what's up.

468
00:29:11,513 --> 00:29:14,115
Oh, for God sakes.

469
00:29:14,116 --> 00:29:17,384
Boy, do you fucking
really want to do this?

470
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:22,824
See, why would anyone
sane do that?

471
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:24,859
Don't worry about me, Dalton.

472
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,894
Is he behind me?

473
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:27,962
Yeah.

474
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:32,367
Old man or not,
I'm gonna punch your ass out.

475
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:33,768
Yeah.

476
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:35,970
What's up, man?
Thought you didn't
want to fight.

477
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:37,505
I don't.

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,107
we learned a valuable
lesson tonight.

00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:22,109
And what's that?

511
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,046
You're more willing
to fight for somebody else
than fight for yourself.

512
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:27,882
You pissed off
a 300-pound guy
to make a point?

I like real-world examples.

five years since
you hit somebody?

You could've
knocked that guy out.
Why didn't you?

Oh, yeah.
You sure you don't
want to pick a fight

Hey.

529
00:32:05,454 --> 00:32:06,987
Hey...

530
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,958
That shit knocked me out.

531
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:13,528
Hell, yeah, it did.
[groaning]

532
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:18,666
[chattering continues]

533
00:32:21,937 --> 00:32:23,738
All right, buddy.
You know?

534
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:26,574
This knee's coming up, boy.
[laughs]

535
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:28,109
Let's see a smile
from my boys.

536
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,010
Hey! Smile.
You want a smile?
Hey.

537
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:31,279
I'll smile

538
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,781
'cause I'm Wyatt "All Hart"
right here.

539
00:32:33,782 --> 00:32:35,283
All Hart.
All Hart, baby.

540
00:32:35,284 --> 00:32:37,085
All Hart
and baby fat.
And hard--

541
00:32:37,086 --> 00:32:39,753
Why you gotta do that, man?
Why you gotta say that, man?

542
00:32:39,754 --> 00:32:41,255
[Dalton]
...pounds over, Wyatt.

543
00:32:41,256 --> 00:32:43,958
That's why.
[Elena]
You are all talk.

544
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:44,959
Let's see it.
Come on.

545
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,127
Ooh!

546
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:47,828
Is it gonna be like that?

547
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:49,797
It's always like that,
Wyatt.

548
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:54,302
You gonna take that, Dalton?

549
00:32:54,303 --> 00:32:56,737
[Wyatt]
You ain't so bad, champ.
You know what?

550
00:32:56,738 --> 00:32:58,306
I ain't so bad?
Hey, fuck it.

551
00:32:58,307 --> 00:32:59,607
I ain't so bad?
Look at you.

552
00:32:59,608 --> 00:33:01,142
You're gonna need it.

553
00:33:01,143 --> 00:33:02,577
You want to talk,
you gotta play.

554
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:04,212
I'll fucking play.
Let's play.

555
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:07,081
I'm not fucking around, Dalton.
This is the real fucking shit.

556
00:33:07,082 --> 00:33:09,684
I will bring it right now.
You don't have
what it takes, Wyatt.

557
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:12,920
I'm not gonna watch
two best friends
beat each other up.

558
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:15,957
You might turn your camera off
for this shit, then.
Put your guard in.

559
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,092
I'm not fucking around.
Put your money
where your mouth is.

560
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:21,362
I'm serious.
Let's fucking go.

561
00:33:21,363 --> 00:33:24,031
Come on.
Let's go.

562
00:33:29,104 --> 00:33:30,738
Hold on, hold on.

563
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:37,878
I never said
it's a game, Wyatt.

564
00:33:47,856 --> 00:33:48,890
[groans]

565
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:53,060
[groans]

566
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:55,463
Wyatt?
[Man]
Somebody call an ambulance.

567
00:33:55,464 --> 00:33:57,332
An ambulance!

568
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:00,234
Oh, God!
What did I do?

569
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:02,203
Ohh...

570
00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:08,676
[TV off]

571
00:34:30,832 --> 00:34:35,002
All right.
I want you to start running,

572
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:38,472
and don't stop
until I tell you.

573
00:34:38,473 --> 00:34:41,875
How the hell you gonna
catch up, old man?

574
00:34:41,876 --> 00:34:44,345
Just do
like I say, now.

575
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:47,181
Go!

576
00:34:55,357 --> 00:34:59,026
¶ Desperately ¶

577
00:34:59,027 --> 00:35:01,496
¶ Trying to find my way ¶

578
00:35:01,497 --> 00:35:05,566
¶ And hopelessly ¶

579
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:07,901
¶ Grabbing for
the words to say ¶

580
00:35:07,902 --> 00:35:11,572
¶ And I can't see ¶

581
00:35:11,573 --> 00:35:14,375
¶ I'm searching
for the remedy ¶

582
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:17,611
¶ And I want to be ¶

583
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:19,580
Come on, son!
Move!

584
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:22,283
I got a three-legged dog
run faster than you.

585
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:24,785
Oh, come on, Dalton.
Keep up with me.

586
00:35:24,786 --> 00:35:26,720
Show me something.

587
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:29,089
Come on.

588
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:34,095
¶ When you're
so far from me ¶

589
00:35:34,096 --> 00:35:35,662
¶ I'm desperately seeking ¶

590
00:35:35,663 --> 00:35:37,565
¶ I'm dangerously hoping ¶

591
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:39,867
¶ The walls will come down ¶

592
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:42,770
¶ 'Cause I don't want ¶

593
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:46,774
¶ To go home right now ¶

594
00:35:46,775 --> 00:35:49,777
¶ And I'm desperately seeking ¶

595
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:51,279
¶ I'm dangerously hoping ¶

596
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,282
¶ The walls will come down ¶

597
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:55,550
¶ 'Cause I ¶

598
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:57,151
What took you so long?

599
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,589
Here you go, Peanut.

600
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,959
Catch you back at the barn.
Come on.
Wait.

601
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,693
[whinnies]
Attaboy.

602
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:22,409
How you feeling?

603
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,648
Oh. Not good, huh?

604
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:29,684
[spits]

605
00:36:29,685 --> 00:36:32,753
Take shorter breaths.

606
00:36:32,754 --> 00:36:34,722
Tell you,
your cardio's terrible

607
00:36:34,723 --> 00:36:36,323
and the coordination's off,

608
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:38,493
but the important thing
is you didn't quit.

609
00:36:38,494 --> 00:36:40,461
Good sign.

610
00:36:40,462 --> 00:36:42,663
You want some water?

611
00:36:42,664 --> 00:36:44,799
There's a spigot
around the side of the house.

612
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,268
Help yourself.
[panting]

613
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:48,870
Do me a favor.

614
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:49,871
Sure.

615
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:52,072
Remind me to kill Wyatt.

616
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:57,545
[grunting]

617
00:36:57,546 --> 00:36:59,647
I ain't gonna have you
holding some jars

618
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:01,315
like in those
old kung fu movies

619
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:02,683
to strengthen your arms.

620
00:37:02,684 --> 00:37:04,117
That's just ridiculous.

621
00:37:05,787 --> 00:37:08,755
I find that these cinder blocks
are a lot more effective.

622
00:37:09,857 --> 00:37:12,226
Tighten your core.

623
00:37:12,227 --> 00:37:14,895
[crying out]

624
00:37:15,997 --> 00:37:18,065
Pick them up.

625
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,072
Whenever you're ready.

626
00:37:26,774 --> 00:37:29,042
I've had enough.

627
00:37:29,043 --> 00:37:31,044
You know,
people in California

628
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:33,547
would love to have
that water you just wasted.

629
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:37,985
Rationing that shit.

630
00:37:39,754 --> 00:37:41,989
[engine grinding]

631
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,991
Aw...

632
00:37:43,992 --> 00:37:45,993
[grinding]

633
00:37:45,994 --> 00:37:47,662
Aw, damn it.

634
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:49,263
Not again.

635
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:51,599
Piece of shit.

636
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,234
[sighs]

637
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:56,671
Look, I know this ain't
gonna be easy for you.

638
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:58,572
Wyatt told me

639
00:37:58,573 --> 00:38:01,776
that you hadn't stepped foot
in a gym since the accident.

640
00:38:01,777 --> 00:38:02,776
Look, I just--

641
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:04,578
You just need
to keep taking

642
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:07,214
one step after another,
and listen to me,

643
00:38:07,215 --> 00:38:09,483
hard as that might be.

644
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:12,353
[engine grinds]
Damn it!

645
00:38:12,354 --> 00:38:15,056
Looks like you're
gonna have to hoof it.

646
00:38:15,057 --> 00:38:18,025
That's all right.
Leave it here.
I'll take a look at it.

647
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:19,393
Hoof it?

648
00:38:19,394 --> 00:38:21,762
Yeah. Yeah.

649
00:38:21,763 --> 00:38:24,732
It's only seven miles
to the gym.

650
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:26,267
Be good for you.

651
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:28,969
Seven miles?

652
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,938
Seven and a half.

653
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:33,140
[no audible dialogue]

654
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:54,495
I'm not fucking around, Dalton.
This is the real fucking shit.

655
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:56,063
You don't have
what it takes, Wyatt.

656
00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:02,303
I ain't so bad?

657
00:39:02,304 --> 00:39:05,105
Let's fucking go.
Come on. Here it comes.

658
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:10,444
Oh, it's like that?
I never said
it's a game, Wyatt.

659
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,351
[Man]
Somebody call an ambulance.
An ambulance!

660
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:27,227
Ah, that's it.
Push, push.

661
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:28,829
Again. That's the way.

662
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,698
Push. That's it.

663
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:35,002
Turn them, just like
you're turning over that punch.

664
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:36,637
Again. Don't stop.
No resting.

665
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:41,676
Come on now.
Watch that center of gravity.

666
00:39:41,677 --> 00:39:43,678
There you go, baby.
There you go.

667
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:46,681
Get a little meat on.
All right.

668
00:39:46,682 --> 00:39:49,450
You're gonna be fighting
that big fucking Mohawk
son of a bitch.

669
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:52,053
Don't quit. I guarantee
you he doesn't quit.
Let's go, baby.

670
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:54,288
Come on, Dalton.

671
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:56,724
¶ Have I had enough? ¶

672
00:39:56,725 --> 00:39:58,459
Take five minutes.
Forget it. You know what?

673
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,961
Take seven hours off.
I'm done.

674
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:02,362
[grunting]

675
00:40:02,363 --> 00:40:04,165
I'm gonna get in there
myself and do it

676
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:05,399
if you don't start
smacking that bag.

677
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,035
¶ Am I only gaining ¶

678
00:40:08,036 --> 00:40:10,470
Man, come on.
Don't snap, snap, snap.

679
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:12,206
You need to get
your heart right, man.

680
00:40:12,207 --> 00:40:15,076
I can't even watch
this anymore.

681
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:22,015
¶ Tell you when you say ¶

682
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,852
[Wyatt]
Come on, Datlon!
Push it!

683
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:26,487
¶ Forever is never ¶

684
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:28,255
Push it, push it, push it!

685
00:40:28,256 --> 00:40:33,260
¶ The word I'll use again ¶

686
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:35,429
¶ Life is fleeting ¶

687
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:38,131
Come on, come on!

688
00:40:38,132 --> 00:40:41,268
Aw, my grandma
can run faster than that.

689
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:43,170
¶ [continues]

690
00:40:49,711 --> 00:40:52,479
No more.
Enough for today.

691
00:40:54,082 --> 00:40:56,784
Enough?
Aw, fuck you, Dalton!

692
00:40:56,785 --> 00:40:57,951
Hey...

693
00:40:57,952 --> 00:40:59,085
Come on, man.

694
00:40:59,086 --> 00:41:01,288
You haven't stepped it up
all week.

695
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:04,157
You got a second chance here,
and that's the best
you're gonna do?

696
00:41:04,158 --> 00:41:05,692
Wyatt--
Fuck it.

697
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:06,961
Seriously, man.

698
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:09,596
If I could walk
for just one day,

699
00:41:09,597 --> 00:41:12,533
I would never stop running,
not for a second.

700
00:41:12,534 --> 00:41:14,268
So don't give me this bullshit
about enough

701
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:16,336
when you got a second chance
to do what I would kill for.

702
00:41:17,873 --> 00:41:20,474
Fuck! This is bullshit!

703
00:41:20,475 --> 00:41:24,145
I go faster in my chair!
You got no fucking heart
right now!

704
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:26,981
He's got a point.

705
00:41:26,982 --> 00:41:29,950
Yeah, he does.

706
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:39,159
¶ [rock]

707
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,128
¶ We droppin' bombs, yeah ¶

708
00:41:41,129 --> 00:41:43,631
¶ Bombs, yeah, bombs ¶

709
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:44,731
¶ Yeah ¶
[bell dings]

710
00:41:44,732 --> 00:41:47,801
¶ We droppin' bombs, yeah ¶

711
00:41:47,802 --> 00:41:50,004
I'd like to thank all of you
for coming here

712
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:53,374
to make what I think
is going to be
some very interesting news.

713
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:55,943
[Victoria]
Thanks for having us,
Grant and Todd.

714
00:41:55,944 --> 00:41:58,678
There's no better show
to make this announcement.

715
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,981
The fight
we've all been waiting for

716
00:42:00,982 --> 00:42:03,450
is finally going to happen.

717
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:05,352
Six weeks from tonight,

718
00:42:05,353 --> 00:42:08,255
Colin Wahle
will face Dalton Hunt.

719
00:42:08,256 --> 00:42:11,024
This will be the culmination
of years of work

720
00:42:11,025 --> 00:42:13,159
in bridging these
two generations of fighters.

721
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,095
Dalton, first off,
I'd like to say

722
00:42:15,096 --> 00:42:17,097
how good it is
to have you back on the scene.

723
00:42:17,098 --> 00:42:19,332
But what the hell
have you been thinking?

724
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,401
Well, Todd,
I've been asking myself that

725
00:42:21,402 --> 00:42:23,236
for the past two weeks.

726
00:42:23,237 --> 00:42:24,939
[Todd] Brick,
are you at all worried

727
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,506
about facing Dalton Hunt
in the ring?

728
00:42:26,507 --> 00:42:28,675
I think it's high time
for the torch to be passed.

729
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:31,111
If he won't give it up,
I'll take it from him.

730
00:42:31,112 --> 00:42:33,147
[Grant]
Any response, Dalton?

731
00:42:33,148 --> 00:42:37,384
Well, Grant, I can't compete
with sound bites like that.

732
00:42:37,385 --> 00:42:38,986
Any predictions, champ?

733
00:42:38,987 --> 00:42:41,421
Hmm. First-round knockout.

734
00:42:41,422 --> 00:42:44,691
I'm gonna show up,
knock his ass out,
get my paycheck.

735
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:46,660
I'm gonna go home.
[scoffs]

736
00:42:46,661 --> 00:42:49,863
Dalton's too much
of a gentleman to say it,
so I'll say it for him.

737
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:51,732
You're a punk, Wahle.

738
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:55,836
Is that right?
Whoa. Hold on now, guys.
Let's keep this professional.

739
00:42:55,837 --> 00:42:59,006
You haven't fought anybody.
Ruolan's too scared to put
you up against a real fighter.

740
00:42:59,007 --> 00:43:02,342
Afraid you might lose.
You stand up against
a fighter like Dalton,

741
00:43:02,343 --> 00:43:03,744
you're going down.

742
00:43:03,745 --> 00:43:05,879
Thanks for your concern.
Don't worry.

743
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,581
I'm not gonna end up
in a wheelchair.

744
00:43:09,751 --> 00:43:12,019
You know what?
I'm more of a man in this chair

745
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,486
than anybody you fought
in your whole career.

746
00:43:13,487 --> 00:43:15,455
What about that?
Where you going, hot wheels?

747
00:43:15,456 --> 00:43:17,758
Hey, man, you never touch
another man's wheels.

748
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:19,259
[grunts]
Aah!

749
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,694
[yells]

750
00:43:20,695 --> 00:43:22,696
[yells]
Take it easy.

751
00:43:24,632 --> 00:43:26,466
Fucking guy
broke my fucking arm!

752
00:43:26,467 --> 00:43:29,069
You're mine, old man!
You're mine!

753
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,071
[groaning]
Hey, hey...

754
00:43:31,072 --> 00:43:33,373
Can we just cut
to commercial? Cut!

755
00:43:37,846 --> 00:43:41,081
Now, time to meet
your new team,

756
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:43,083
your new best friends

757
00:43:43,084 --> 00:43:45,018
and worst enemies.

758
00:43:46,988 --> 00:43:48,521
First, Dexter,

759
00:43:48,522 --> 00:43:51,424
former Golden Gloves fighter
and welterweight champion.

760
00:43:51,425 --> 00:43:55,062
He's gonna be working
on getting your speed
and your punching power up.

761
00:43:55,063 --> 00:43:58,598
Kwan here has trained
with the Greasers.

762
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:00,834
His job's to turn you
into a grappling machine.

763
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,371
Finally, Bronner.

764
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,341
Born in the Bahamas,
raised in Thailand.

765
00:44:08,342 --> 00:44:10,443
He's been a fighter
since he was 8.

766
00:44:10,444 --> 00:44:14,347
Your legs and knees are his
to turn into weapons.

767
00:44:14,348 --> 00:44:16,583
All right.
Let's get started.

768
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:19,453
Dexter, you're up.

769
00:44:19,454 --> 00:44:20,587

[muffled yell]

793
00:45:40,301 --> 00:45:41,935
Damn it, Dalton.

794
00:45:41,936 --> 00:45:43,937
Get your head
into training.

795
00:45:43,938 --> 00:45:45,973
Now, Wahle's out there
probably working ten times

796
00:45:45,974 --> 00:45:47,975
harder than you.

797
00:45:47,976 --> 00:45:49,877
All right.
Let's run it again.

798
00:45:49,878 --> 00:45:52,546

don't go easy on him.

00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:36,590

how my fighter's doing.

812
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:47,868
This place is a dive.

813
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:52,172
Why don't you come work out
at the company's gym?

814
00:46:52,173 --> 00:46:55,109
Everything is
state of the art.

815
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,311
I like this place just fine.

816
00:46:58,312 --> 00:47:00,147
Suit yourself.

817
00:47:02,884 --> 00:47:05,652
I knew you were
in great shape,

818
00:47:05,653 --> 00:47:06,987
just not

819
00:47:06,988 --> 00:47:09,256
this good.

820
00:47:09,257 --> 00:47:10,690
[barbell clangs on ground]

821
00:47:10,691 --> 00:47:11,792
Look,

822
00:47:11,793 --> 00:47:14,627
I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

823
00:47:15,963 --> 00:47:17,964
Sorry. I just wanted
to apologize

824
00:47:17,965 --> 00:47:20,633
if I was too harsh,
Dalton.

825
00:47:21,936 --> 00:47:24,805
There's no reason
that we can't get along.

826
00:47:24,806 --> 00:47:26,906
Oh, I can think
of a couple of reasons.

827
00:47:37,818 --> 00:47:41,755
The pay-per-view numbers
are coming in for the fight,

828
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:45,158
and they're damn good.

829
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,834
We could make
a really great pair.

830
00:47:57,205 --> 00:47:59,306
You bought a fight,

831
00:47:59,307 --> 00:48:01,642
not this fighter.

832
00:48:01,643 --> 00:48:05,678
So how about you lock up
when you're done?

833
00:48:08,516 --> 00:48:11,017
You asshole.

834
00:48:11,018 --> 00:48:12,419
You're gonna be so sorry

835
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,788
for the opportunity
you just missed.

836
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:17,891
The Wahle is going to
crush you. You hear me?

837
00:48:20,228 --> 00:48:22,729
You don't stand a chance.

838
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:25,499
[grunting]

839
00:48:28,969 --> 00:48:30,970
[grunting continues]

840
00:48:38,313 --> 00:48:39,713
And time.

841
00:48:39,714 --> 00:48:41,414
Take a breather.

842
00:48:41,415 --> 00:48:42,849
[panting]

843
00:48:43,918 --> 00:48:46,253
Aw, you son of a bitch.

844
00:48:46,254 --> 00:48:48,888
Why don't you just take it
down to the tackle shop?

845
00:48:51,192 --> 00:48:54,727
You can't always let
someone else fix your problems.

846
00:48:54,728 --> 00:48:56,396
You should know that.

847
00:48:58,433 --> 00:49:00,734
What, more philosophy?

848
00:49:00,735 --> 00:49:02,402
It's all philosophy.

849
00:49:02,403 --> 00:49:04,738
Anything anyone
ever says or does

850
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:07,107
is tied to their philosophy
of the world.

851
00:49:07,108 --> 00:49:09,943
Can't I just
do more running?

852
00:49:09,944 --> 00:49:11,878
This is important, Dalton.

853
00:49:11,879 --> 00:49:14,181
No more. Not today.

854
00:49:17,518 --> 00:49:20,187
So what, you're just gonna quit
every time I bring this up?

855
00:49:21,655 --> 00:49:24,457
I'm not quitting.
Well, you might as well.

856
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:28,228
Ain't really doing anything.

857
00:49:28,229 --> 00:49:31,664
The best running you do
is running scared.

858
00:49:33,468 --> 00:49:36,336
Oh. Did I hit a sore spot?

859
00:49:36,337 --> 00:49:38,705
Huh?

860
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:42,042
I bet you're just dying
to hit me, aren't you?

861
00:49:43,945 --> 00:49:46,113
Okay.

862
00:49:46,114 --> 00:49:49,383
Right now. Come on.
Give me your best shot.

863
00:49:49,384 --> 00:49:51,484
Come on. Seriously?

864
00:49:51,485 --> 00:49:53,120
Seriously.

865
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:56,356
Are you too scared
to do that?

866
00:49:56,357 --> 00:49:58,391
You fucking pussy.

867
00:49:59,627 --> 00:50:01,561
You ain't no fighter.

868
00:50:01,562 --> 00:50:03,062
[yells]

869
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:06,900
Damn it.

870
00:50:06,901 --> 00:50:08,801
You ain't mad
at me, Dalton.

871
00:50:08,802 --> 00:50:10,537
You're mad
at yourself.

872
00:50:10,538 --> 00:50:14,107
Until you realize that,
you ain't going nowhere.

873
00:50:14,108 --> 00:50:16,976
[breathing heavily]

874
00:50:19,013 --> 00:50:21,781
You think I like
what I've become?

875
00:50:21,782 --> 00:50:23,983
What I haven't become?

876
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:25,852
I ask myself every day,

877
00:50:25,853 --> 00:50:27,721
if only I'd kicked higher

878
00:50:27,722 --> 00:50:30,424
or lower, if only
he'd turned the other way--

879
00:50:30,425 --> 00:50:34,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But it didn't happen
that way, did it?

880
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:36,162
It ain't about
what if.

881
00:50:36,163 --> 00:50:38,164
It's about what is!

882
00:50:38,165 --> 00:50:41,468
And until you face
what happen

883
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:44,037
and believe that it couldn't
have happened any other way,

884
00:50:44,038 --> 00:50:47,006
you're stuck, Dalton.

885
00:50:47,007 --> 00:50:49,943
You're literally
living in your guilt,

886
00:50:49,944 --> 00:50:51,979
and you've become
so used to it

887
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,980
that you are just
too scared to move on.

888
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:55,882
It's not that goddamn easy.

889
00:50:55,883 --> 00:50:57,350
Oh, hell.
What is easy?

890
00:50:57,351 --> 00:51:00,420
Look at Wyatt.
You think anything's
easy for him?

891
00:51:00,421 --> 00:51:02,522
He ain't never
gonna walk again.

892
00:51:02,523 --> 00:51:05,091
He's in a wheelchair
for the rest of his life.

893
00:51:05,092 --> 00:51:07,160
Ain't nothing
easy for him.

894
00:51:09,497 --> 00:51:11,898
The least you can do
is step up

895
00:51:11,899 --> 00:51:14,834
and be the warrior
that he can't be.

896
00:51:19,707 --> 00:51:21,708

So it's time

00:55:13,774 --> 00:55:17,109
You ever heard of the legend
of a thousand swords?

Nah.

943
00:55:18,145 --> 00:55:19,479
Well,

944
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,980
Neyatu Tatagami

945
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:24,718
was a great Ronin Samurai
Warrior in the 1600s.

946
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:28,555
He was a bandit,
outlaw and a folk hero

947
00:55:28,556 --> 00:55:30,657
to the people of Japan.

948
00:55:30,658 --> 00:55:34,327
Well, one day, he robbed
a young, arrogant nobleman

949
00:55:34,328 --> 00:55:37,497
who decided to seek revenge
on Tatagami.

950
00:55:37,498 --> 00:55:40,232
Well, the nobleman put
a large cash reward

951
00:55:40,233 --> 00:55:41,801
on Tatagami's head.

952
00:55:41,802 --> 00:55:43,236
And the money was so great

953
00:55:43,237 --> 00:55:45,839
that a thousand warriors
showed up for a chance
to collect.

954
00:55:47,574 --> 00:55:49,676
Well, the nobleman,
not being one

955
00:55:49,677 --> 00:55:51,678
to miss an opportunity
to get Tatagami,

956
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:54,180
hired them all.

957
00:55:54,181 --> 00:55:56,917
Well, everybody figured that
Tatagami would cut and run,

958
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:59,085
but instead, he sent a message

959
00:55:59,086 --> 00:56:01,621
saying that he would stay and
fight the thousand warriors.

960
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:05,224
Now, in the morning
of the battle,

961
00:56:05,225 --> 00:56:08,728
Tatagami meditated
and remained calm.

962
00:56:09,764 --> 00:56:11,765
A small boy
in a nearby village

963
00:56:11,766 --> 00:56:15,068
stopped Tatagami
on the way to the fight,
and he asked him,

964
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:18,772
"How can you beat
a thousand warriors?"

965
00:56:18,773 --> 00:56:21,841
Tatagami looked at the boy,
smiled, and he said,

966
00:56:21,842 --> 00:56:23,476
"Simple.

967
00:56:23,477 --> 00:56:26,680
I will just use
1,000 swords."

968
00:56:27,748 --> 00:56:29,449
And with that,

969
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:32,652
Tatagami marched off
to meet his destiny.

970
00:56:32,653 --> 00:56:35,321
I don't get it.

971
00:56:35,322 --> 00:56:37,990
You can defeat any enemy

972
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:40,893
as long as you take him apart
piece by piece,

973
00:56:40,894 --> 00:56:42,862
one thread at a time.

974
00:56:42,863 --> 00:56:44,864

You flinching?
You fucking pussy.

01:11:08,829 --> 01:11:10,663
I shot the fucker--
Let's see it.

01:11:27,013 --> 01:11:28,747
Wahle,

1223
01:11:28,748 --> 01:11:32,017
see you on Saturday.

1224
01:11:32,018 --> 01:11:33,352
Mm-hmm.

1225
01:11:40,093 --> 01:11:41,860
Not now.

1226
01:11:46,366 --> 01:11:48,733

gonna blow it down ¶

1231
01:12:07,153 --> 01:12:09,555
Yo, Hunt.

1232
01:12:09,556 --> 01:12:12,124
Aw, not this again.

1233
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:15,193
Yo, man, I don't want
any more trouble.

1234
01:12:15,194 --> 01:12:17,195
Yo, man, I saw you on TV.

1235
01:12:17,196 --> 01:12:19,698
And what? I suck?

1236
01:12:19,699 --> 01:12:22,768
Well, you ain't
no public speaker,
but you got good hands.

1237
01:12:22,769 --> 01:12:24,503
You can fight
like a motherfucker.

1238
01:12:24,504 --> 01:12:27,306
But you know that
punk bitch Colin Wahle?

1239
01:12:27,307 --> 01:12:29,207
Do me a favor.

1240
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:31,376
Fuck his ass up for me
tonight, yo.

1241
01:12:32,445 --> 01:12:34,480
That's what's up.

1242
01:12:34,481 --> 01:12:35,447

01:12:39,018 --> 01:12:40,852
Peace out.
Come on, boys.

1247

Yeah, I knew
he'd come around.

1248
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,961
Still can't play football
worth shit,

1249
01:12:49,962 --> 01:12:52,197

This is a big night.

1253
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:08,380
You're a good lay,
and we make money together,

1254
01:13:08,381 --> 01:13:10,582
so don't fuck this up.

1255
01:13:18,157 --> 01:13:20,526
What a crazy bitch.

How you feeling?

1258
01:13:32,138 --> 01:13:33,972
Honestly,

1259
01:13:36,576 --> 01:13:39,378
I'm scared.

1260
01:13:39,379 --> 01:13:41,146
Well,

1261
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:44,984
not for long.

1262
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:46,418

Ladies and gentlemen,
it's now time

1265
01:13:59,566 --> 01:14:03,068
for your main event!

[cheering continues]

1267
01:14:05,238 --> 01:14:08,106
Folks, this has gotta be
one for the ages.

1268
01:14:08,107 --> 01:14:10,375
Dalton Hunt has come out
of retirement

1269
01:14:10,376 --> 01:14:13,178
to face the current champ,
Colin Wahle, in a three-round

1270
01:14:13,179 --> 01:14:15,280
non-titled fight.
Yes, indeed.

1271
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:17,149
The Brick,
as he's known to fight fans,

1272
01:14:17,150 --> 01:14:18,784
has blasted his way
through the R.F.C.

1273
01:14:18,785 --> 01:14:21,286
and is now just one win away
from the all-time record.

1274
01:14:21,287 --> 01:14:24,857
But I doubt he's had to face
anyone like Hunt in his career.

1275
01:14:24,858 --> 01:14:25,991
It's gonna be a doozy.

1276
01:14:28,994 --> 01:14:30,929
The challenger tonight

1277
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:32,564
is a former R.F.C. champion

1278
01:14:32,565 --> 01:14:35,934
making his first appearance
in the ring in five years,

1279
01:14:35,935 --> 01:14:38,436
standing 6'2" tall,

1280
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:39,971

is the R.F.C. Heavyweight
Champion of the World,

Y'all both know the drill.

If I see anything
get out of hand,
I will stop it.

Watch the shots
to the back of the head.

1308
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:17,736
And keep it clean.
Got it?

You know it.

1393
01:22:09,088 --> 01:22:12,223
All right.
This might hurt like hell.

1394
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:14,526
[grunts]

1395
01:22:18,864 --> 01:22:20,798
Ain't nothing but
a little old scratch, Doc.

1396
01:22:22,602 --> 01:22:24,603
Yeah.

1397
01:22:24,604 --> 01:22:26,170
[Grant]
We're getting the okay.

1398
01:22:26,171 --> 01:22:29,173
This fight is going
into the third round.
[Todd] Unbelievable.

1399
01:22:29,174 --> 01:22:32,076
Finish him! Got it?
I want you to finish him!

1400
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:34,746
Finish him, asshole!

1401
01:22:34,747 --> 01:22:36,248
¶ I make it last ¶

1402
01:22:36,249 --> 01:22:37,949
¶ Got nothing, coming up ¶
Fuck!

1403
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,284
¶ From behind ¶
All right.

1404
01:22:39,285 --> 01:22:40,985
It's time
to take him apart.

1405
01:22:40,986 --> 01:22:42,487
You can do this.

1406
01:22:42,488 --> 01:22:44,088
Take him apart!

1407
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:46,157
Time to bring out
the swords.

1408
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:47,625
All right.

1409
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:55,833
¶ I got an earful
of your flattering lines ¶

1410
01:22:55,834 --> 01:22:59,170
¶ You're getting good
'cause you never look him
straight in the eyes ¶

1411
01:22:59,171 --> 01:23:02,840
¶ I'm at the area tanks,
and I'm there in the hurt ¶

1412
01:23:02,841 --> 01:23:07,211
¶ I got a fight to incite
'cause I find you absurd ¶

1413
01:23:07,212 --> 01:23:09,047
[Wyatt]
Get him, Dalton.

1414
01:23:09,048 --> 01:23:11,616
That's my best friend
right there.

1415
01:23:11,617 --> 01:23:14,051
¶ I'm burnin' it down ¶
[bell dings]

1416
01:23:14,052 --> 01:23:15,753
¶ Ohhhhhh ¶

1417
01:23:15,754 --> 01:23:17,455
¶ I'm burnin' it down ¶

1418
01:23:17,456 --> 01:23:18,390
¶ Ohhhhhh ¶

1419
01:23:18,391 --> 01:23:19,957
Yeah! Ow!

1420
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,692
Son of a bitch.
Get him, Dalton.

1421
01:23:21,693 --> 01:23:23,461
[yelling]

1422
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:25,463
¶ I'm getting to ¶

1423
01:23:25,464 --> 01:23:27,598
¶ I'm gonna burn it down ¶

1424
01:23:27,599 --> 01:23:29,467
¶ Ohhhhhh ¶

1425
01:23:29,468 --> 01:23:31,302
¶ Gonna burn it down ¶

1426
01:23:31,303 --> 01:23:33,771
¶ Ohhhhhh ¶

1427
01:23:33,772 --> 01:23:35,139
[Grant]
Holy shit!

1428
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,975
The fight has spilled
out of the ring, folks.

1429
01:23:37,976 --> 01:23:39,277
Come on, Dalton. Go.

1430
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:47,151
Yeah!

1431
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,489
Yes!
A thousand swords, baby!

1432
01:23:54,493 --> 01:23:56,260
[yells]

1433
01:24:02,701 --> 01:24:04,669
[crowd cheering]

1434
01:24:07,173 --> 01:24:10,074
[Grant]
The champ is down!

1435
01:24:10,075 --> 01:24:12,343
You d-- You did it!
We did it!

1436
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:15,980
Dalton Hunt has just
knocked out the champ!

1437
01:24:15,981 --> 01:24:20,017
Yes! Right there, baby!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1438
01:24:20,018 --> 01:24:23,154
Get up! Get up, Colin!
Get up! Get up!

1439
01:24:23,155 --> 01:24:25,757
The winner.
[cheering continues]

1440
01:24:29,294 --> 01:24:32,029
[Victoria yelling]
I'm so proud of you.

1441
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:34,031
Get up!

1442
01:24:34,032 --> 01:24:35,367
Get up!

1443
01:24:35,368 --> 01:24:37,869
This the kind of show
you're looking for?

1444
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:39,036
Fuck you!

1445
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:42,039
Fuck you!
I'm so proud of you.

1446
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,509
Dalton, how does it feel
to be back on top?

1447
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:46,043
Give it to me.
[yelling]

1448
01:24:46,044 --> 01:24:47,712
Listen up.

1449
01:24:47,713 --> 01:24:49,647
This does not count.

1450
01:24:49,648 --> 01:24:50,881
Okay? You hear me?

1451
01:24:50,882 --> 01:24:52,817
The cage broke.

1452
01:24:52,818 --> 01:24:54,552
He's disqualified.

1453
01:24:54,553 --> 01:24:56,654
[crowd jeering]
Shut the fuck up!

1454
01:24:56,655 --> 01:24:59,156
All of you losers,

1455
01:24:59,157 --> 01:25:01,158
I own this place.

1456
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:03,428
I own this place!
I own you!

1457
01:25:03,429 --> 01:25:05,597
Without me,
you're nothing.

1458
01:25:05,598 --> 01:25:08,065
[yells]
Fuck you, bitch!

1459
01:25:08,066 --> 01:25:11,402
That's what you get
for kicking me and my daughter
out of my house, bitch.

1460
01:25:11,403 --> 01:25:13,405
Let me go!

1461
01:25:13,406 --> 01:25:14,939
Now stay away from my man.

1462
01:25:18,411 --> 01:25:22,113
¶ I know that you ¶

1463
01:25:22,114 --> 01:25:23,882
You win.

1464
01:25:23,883 --> 01:25:25,850
Congratulations.

1465
01:25:30,055 --> 01:25:36,760
¶ It's always been you ¶

1466
01:25:36,761 --> 01:25:40,064
If I hadn't seen it myself,
I wouldn't have believed it.

1467
01:25:40,065 --> 01:25:41,700
But controversy or not,

1468
01:25:41,701 --> 01:25:44,269
Dalton Hunt fought
and won like a champion.

1469
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:46,437
Here's what Colin Wahle
had to say for himself
this morning.

1470
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:49,407
I'm just here
to let the fans know
that old man got lucky.

1471
01:25:49,408 --> 01:25:51,609
That's it.

1472
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:53,645
Are you ready
to fight him again?
Absolutely.

1473
01:25:53,646 --> 01:25:55,913
Just waiting for Ruolan
to set the fight up.

1474
01:25:55,914 --> 01:25:59,183
Would you be willing
to put up the belt
next time?

1475
01:26:00,952 --> 01:26:02,320
Man, get that the hell
away from me!

1476
01:26:02,321 --> 01:26:03,955
It's nice to see
that this loss

1477
01:26:03,956 --> 01:26:05,857
hasn't changed
the Wahle's attitude.

1478
01:26:05,858 --> 01:26:07,425
On an interesting
side note,

1479
01:26:07,426 --> 01:26:09,127
Wahle's referring
to Arnold Ruolan,

1480
01:26:09,128 --> 01:26:11,162
who relieved his daughter
of ownership of the R.F.C.

1481
01:26:11,163 --> 01:26:14,298
following that fiasco
that happened at the Luminar
two nights ago.

1482
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:16,501
[Todd] Hunt hasn't said
whether this is a return
to fighting for him,

1483
01:26:16,502 --> 01:26:19,036
but his strong showing
has this reporter thinking

1484
01:26:19,037 --> 01:26:22,039
that his retirement
might just be over.

1485
01:26:24,809 --> 01:26:26,377
[horse whinnying]

1486
01:26:27,513 --> 01:26:30,014
So, Dalton, you did
real good out there.

1487
01:26:30,015 --> 01:26:31,816
So, I, uh--
Come, honey.

1488
01:26:31,817 --> 01:26:34,185
...got you
a little upgrade.
[grunts]

1489
01:26:38,657 --> 01:26:40,224
Wow. Super cool, Dad.

1490
01:26:40,225 --> 01:26:43,094
[Willy]
Took a little doing,
but she runs like new.

1491
01:26:43,095 --> 01:26:46,164
Those flames right there--
that was my idea.

1492
01:26:46,165 --> 01:26:48,098
I couldn't have
one of my fighters

1493
01:26:48,099 --> 01:26:50,100
driving around
in a clunker.

1494
01:26:50,101 --> 01:26:52,136
Gotta respect
those old classics.

1495
01:26:52,137 --> 01:26:54,939
Believe me, I do.

1496
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:57,575
But I should be giving you
the truck or something

1497
01:26:57,576 --> 01:26:59,043
for everything
you've done for me.

1498
01:26:59,044 --> 01:27:01,045
Yeah, what do I need
a truck for?

1499
01:27:01,046 --> 01:27:03,181
I got my wheels
right over there.

1500
01:27:03,182 --> 01:27:04,215
Can I pet him?

1501
01:27:04,216 --> 01:27:05,350
Well,
sure you can, hon.

1502
01:27:05,351 --> 01:27:07,352
Careful, careful,
careful. He bites.

1503
01:27:07,353 --> 01:27:08,686
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1504
01:27:08,687 --> 01:27:12,723
Well, all right, then.
Let's take it for a spin.

1505
01:27:12,724 --> 01:27:14,592
Well, now, it ain't
going to be that easy

1506
01:27:14,593 --> 01:27:17,127
because the keys are out
there in the oak tree.

1507
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:20,298
Is that right?
Yeah.

1508
01:27:20,299 --> 01:27:21,799
And to prove that you're worthy

1509
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,802
of a fine piece of automotive
history like this,

1510
01:27:24,803 --> 01:27:26,471
you're going
to have to race us.

1511
01:27:26,472 --> 01:27:28,406
1, 2, 3, go. Go!

1512
01:27:28,407 --> 01:27:30,141
Get out, Wyatt.

1513
01:27:30,142 --> 01:27:31,075
¶ [rock]

1514

Move it, move it,
move it, Dalt!

1515
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:40,718
Come on, Dalton! Go!
My grandmother can run
faster than that!

1516
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:43,421
[chuckles]
My grandma's real fast,
though.

1517
01:27:43,422 --> 01:27:45,756
Well,

1518
01:27:45,757 --> 01:27:48,426
Dalton's never gonna
forgive me for this one.

1519
01:27:48,427 --> 01:27:50,461
Come on.

1520
01:27:50,462 --> 01:27:51,696
¶ I'm a renegade ¶

1521
01:27:51,697 --> 01:27:53,031
¶ Back out, motherfucker ¶

1522
01:27:53,032 --> 01:27:54,365
¶ You better tap out ¶

¶ Put me up into a corner ¶

¶ Be a witness ¶

1533

¶ Yeah, this is critical mass ¶

1534
01:28:09,515 --> 01:28:12,684
¶ We invite the revolution,
we ignite the past ¶

¶ Devil, the party's over,

¶ I've been dreaming
about my freedom ¶

01:29:16,548 --> 01:29:19,116
¶ This dog will, what? ¶
[dog growling]

1564
01:29:20,853 --> 01:29:23,420
How long you think
I'm just gonna let you
fuck with me

1565
01:29:23,421 --> 01:29:26,524
and not do something
about it?

1566
01:29:26,525 --> 01:29:30,127
You think I'm just gonna
turn the other cheek?

1567
01:29:30,128 --> 01:29:32,997
¶ You push me,
so I'll push you right back ¶

1568
01:29:32,998 --> 01:29:35,767
¶ You push me,
so I'll push you right back ¶

1569
01:29:35,768 --> 01:29:38,536
¶ You push me,
so I'll push you right back ¶

1570
01:29:38,537 --> 01:29:41,171
¶ You push me,
so I'll push you right back ¶
