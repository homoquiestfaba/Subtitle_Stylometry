We need an incredible DJ for music,

434

we need a flipper,
someone with really great power moves,

435
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,958
and most importantly,
we need an amazing choreographer.

at the previous competition winners,

00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,833
He captained the winning team
three years in a row.

439
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,125
Maybe we could get him
to choreograph for us.

440
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,916
Yeah, Quinn,
everybody knows Jake Taylor, all right?

441
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,208

until he tore his ACL.

442
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,458
No one has seen or heard from him
in, like, two years.

00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,625

it was just a simple mapping.

995
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,750
It was amazing. I just…

996
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:39,666
What?

997
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:42,041
I miss dancing.

998
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,416
So why'd you give it up?

999
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:47,125
'Cause I wanted to be the best…

1000
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,833
And I wasn't any more, so…

1001
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:50,750
What?

1002
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:53,916
You're so good. I can't dance at all.

1003
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,750
That's because you can't learn to dance
by reading a book, Quinn.

1004
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:03,833
Why is Duke so important to you
that you would do all of this?

1005
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:05,250
I mean, it's just a school.

1006
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:08,250
My dad went there.

1007
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:11,125
He loved it.

1008
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,458
Like, really, really loved it.

1009
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,708
I don't... It wasn't always my plan to go.

1010
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,333
But after he died,

1011
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:23,833
I felt like being there would make me
connected to him somehow.

1012
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:25,541
I don't know. Maybe it sounds stupid.

1013
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,375
No, it's not stupid, Quinn.

1014
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:29,625
Plus, it's close to home.

1015
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,208
You know, my mom
wouldn't have to be all by herself. And…

1016
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:35,500
The more that I wanted it,
the more that she wanted it.

1017
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:38,458
Now she's done everything
to help me get this far.

1018
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:40,166
I feel like I can't let her down.

1019
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,708
So are you doing this for her or for you?

1020

[Quinn] Honestly, I don't really know.

1021

a life of its own now, but…

to fix your freestyle problem.

Give me your jacket.

O-Okay.

1027

React to what I do.

Oh, I don't remember signing up
for a dance lesson tonight.

1029

a free lesson

Oh, I would never.

- [laughs] Okay.

let your body drive you.

00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:42,708
I don't need anyone's help.

1155
00:54:42,791 --> 00:54:45,291
I just don't understand
why they're taking so long.

1156
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:47,375
Didn't she say you were like a shoo-in?

1157
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,416
No, you said I was a shoo-in.

1158
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,166
She said I would make
an excellent addition.

1159
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,416
Either way,
they should not lead you on like that.

1160
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,125
- I've got it covered. Don't worry.
- Why are you so chill about this?

1161
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:59,666
I just realized I have to go.
I'll see you later.

1162
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,791
Bye. Oh, you know what?

1163
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,250
My gynecologist is a Dukie.

1164
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:05,625
Jake Taylor?

1165
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:06,833
It's definitely him.

1166
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:07,750
So hot.

1167
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:08,958
Great.

1168
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:11,458
So Jas is dancing
to Jake Taylor's choreography.

1169
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,791
God, this is exactly what I needed today.

1170
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:16,000
[Brit] What happened
with your Juilliard audition?

1171
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,791
Oh, I don't know, Britney.
Why don't you mind your damn business?

1172
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:25,250
Sorry, it's just that they said
conservatory dancing is different,

1173
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:28,750
and if I want to be taken seriously,

1174
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:31,750
I would need to learn to control my fire.

1175
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:32,916
[Brit] Oh, it's okay.

1176
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,750
[sobbing]

1177
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:35,875
[Brit] I'm so sorry.

1178
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,208
Wait. What? Don't be sorry for me.
Be sorry for them.

1179
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:43,500
Yeah, I would die before I extinguish
my flames for some stuffy-ass school.

1180
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:45,875
You don't want this?
You don't want that?

1181
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:48,958
You don't want this fire?
Your loss.

1182
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:49,958
Their loss.

1183
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:52,750
You know who else didn't go
to Juilliard? Cardi B.

1184
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,375
Bruno Mars, Jamiroquai, Janelle Monáe,
Janet Jackson, Oprah, Obama.

1185
00:55:58,791 --> 00:55:59,666
Lots of people.

1186
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,625
So I'm fine.

1187
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,500
Do we still call him Juilliard?

1188
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,791
[woman]
Quinn, you can do better than this.

1189
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:17,000
[Jas] Dude!

1190
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:18,791
Robby can flip!

1191
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,583
- [mouths word]
- [Jas] He flipped!

1192
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:23,083
[all] Yeah! [laughing]

1193
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,291
Robby! Whoo! [laughing]

1194
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:26,416
[Jas] Come on! Come on!

1195
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:29,333
[Juilliard] All right.
Now that we've saged the space,

1196
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:31,541
let's try to adjust
this terrible lighting.

1197
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:34,458
Brit, Trinity, can you help me
find the switches, please?

1198
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:40,250
Where's Jake?

1199
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:42,958
[door closes]

1200
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:45,958
What are you doing here?

1201
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:47,875
- We booked the studio.
- [Quinn] What?

1202
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:51,083
You know you have to actually pay
to use a dance studio, right?

1203
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,125
Otherwise, people get fired.

1204
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:58,916
Jake!

1205
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,541
Are you kidding me?

1206
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:04,166
- Jake, everything's gonna be okay.
- How?

1207
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,250
How is it gonna be okay?

1208
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:09,916
Quinn, I just got fired.

1209
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,625
I need this job.
How am I gonna pay my rent?

1210
00:57:18,291 --> 00:57:19,333
Shit.

1211
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,958
Is that how you want to play this,
you little psychopath?

1212
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:27,500
[chuckles] Your outburst is really eating
into our rehearsal time, sweetie.

1213
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:31,416
You seriously felt so threatened by us
that you had to sabotage our team?

1214
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,625
I didn't do anything.
You do that all on your own.

1215
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,041
See, I still remember
when we were freshmen,

1216
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,458
and you didn't make the Birds.

1217
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:41,041
But you begged,

1218
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,833
and you did the seniors' homework
and washed their cars.

1219
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,833
Flank me. Flank me, flank me.

1220
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:55,125
You know, a lot's changed, Jas.
Now everyone washes my car.

1221
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:56,958
It's so clean, you could eat sushi off it.

1222
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:57,875
I did it once.

1223
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:01,833
Well, enjoy your poke off your Prius
while you can.

1224
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:02,916
This is not over.

1225
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:05,708
And you look like a tampon commercial.

1226
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:06,625
Let's go.

1227
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:13,708
[Jas] Oh, ho, it's on now.

1228
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:16,208
- Oh, we're taking him down.
- [Tapes] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1229
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:17,375
[Priya] Oh yes.

1230
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,833
Hey.

1231
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,625
Where's Jake?

1232
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:22,875
[door shuts]

1233
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:31,958
[Quinn] <i>Over the next few days,</i>
<i>I reached out to Jake a bunch of times,</i>

1234
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:35,291
<i>and I waited for him to text me back,
but he never did.</i>

1235
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:40,000
<i>Meanwhile, all the time I had put
into the dance team had wrecked my GPA.</i>

1236
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:44,208
<i>And that's when I got the e-mail.</i>

1237
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:49,250
<i>"As of January 22nd,
I will no longer be working</i>

1238
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:51,541
<i>in the Duke University
admissions department.</i>

1239
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:56,125
<i>If this is in regards to an application,
please contact our office directly."</i>

1240
00:58:56,208 --> 00:58:57,041
What?

1241
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,291
[repeating] No.

1242
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:04,416
[Ms. Ramirez] <i>-Hello?</i>
- Thank God. Hi!

1243
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,500
Ms. Ramirez, it is... It's Quinn Ackerman
from Woodbright High.

1244
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:09,583
Uh, you probably don't remember me.
I'm the dancer.

1245
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:12,958
Oh yeah, the illuminator.
How ya doin'? You keeping it lit?

1246
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:15,833
Yeah. Um, so, I saw the e-mail
that you sent.

1247
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:18,041
What's that about?
What's happening over there?

1248
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:20,916
Yeah. I'll tell you
what's happening here… Nothing.

1249
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,916
[Quinn] <i>What happened to…</i>
<i>shaking things up?</i>

1250
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,208
Yeah. You know what?
They really weren't into that.

1251
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:27,625
What can I say? I tried.

1252
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:28,625
[Quinn] <i>You tried?</i>

1253
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:30,500
I learned how to dance.

1254
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:32,625
[Ms. Ramirez] <i>I'm sorry. Wait.</i>
<i>What did you say?</i>

1255
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:35,166
I started a dance team for you.

1256
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,291
Good for you, girl. You blew up the box.

1257
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:39,041
No, I blew up my life.

1258
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:42,250
You didn't blow up your life.
You blew up your box.

1259
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,333
What does that mean?

1260
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:46,375
- [guard clears throat]
- I gotta go.

1261
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:48,958
- It's turning into a whole thing.
- <i>No, you don't have to...</i>

1262
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:49,958
Hello?

1263
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:51,916
No.

1264
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:54,291
Shit! Shit!

1265
00:59:59,208 --> 01:00:01,208
[indistinct conversations]

1266
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:03,666
[mom] A half-day suspension?

1267
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,458
What if Duke finds out?

1268
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,208
I know. I had a bad day,
and the dance team...

1269
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:11,583
Ever since you started dancing,
you have been completely off-balance.

1270
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:14,333
Your grades have been dropping.
You're home late. I...

1271
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:19,666
I don't understand why you felt the need
to have this whole other hobby

1272
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,333
that has nothing to do

1273
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,500
with what we've been working towards
this whole time.

1274
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:24,458
Mom, I lied to you.

1275
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:26,291
- What?
- I lied because

1276
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:29,666
the Duke interview
was not going as well as I said it was,

1277
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,041
and the admissions lady
brought up the Thunderbirds,

1278
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:33,750
so I made her think I was on the team…

1279
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:36,083
- What are you talking about?
- …though I only do lighting.

1280
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,458
So then Jas and I decided
to make our own team…

1281
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:39,958
- Stop.
- …then today I found out

1282
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:41,875
the admissions lady
doesn't work there anymore.

1283
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:45,208
I don't understand.
So is it over? Is it done?

1284
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,916
I still have another month
to resubmit my grades,

1285
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,083
but they've gotten…

1286
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:54,000
Pretty bad, and the suspension is…

1287
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:55,958
Not good.

1288
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:00,958
I'm really sorry, Mom.

1289
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,333
Oh, man.

1290
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:06,666
Okay.

1291
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:09,625
It's okay.

1292
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,208
We're gonna figure this out.

1293
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:15,625
You're gonna buckle down
and focus on your school work,

1294
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:17,375
and you're gonna pull those grades up.

1295
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:24,541
You know what this means, though?

1296
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:31,958
So you're just gonna quit on us?
Just like that?

1297
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:34,458
I really need to get my grades up.

1298
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:39,083
Plus, I'm the worst dancer on the team.
You guys don't really need me. And…

1299
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:42,250
I'm holding you guys back.
I'm the weak link.

1300
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:43,458
Yeah.

1301
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:44,791
And we stuck by you.

1302
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:47,583
Jas…

1303
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,500
I did all of this for <i>you,</i> Quinn.

1304
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:54,791
I quit the Birds for you.
You begged me to.

1305
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,791
And what? Just 'cause your mom says
you have to, you're gonna bail on us?

1306
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:00,833
I'm really sorry.

1307
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,083
Wow.

1308
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:06,541
For a second, I thought you cared,
and you weren't just using all of us.

1309
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:08,500
I do care. I still care.

1310
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:11,416
You know, I really hope
you get into Duke, Quinn.

1311
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:14,916
And I hope it was worth
losing your only friend over.

1312
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:17,666
Ja... Jas?

1313
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:19,583
Jas?

1314
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:21,291
Jas!

1315
01:02:22,791 --> 01:02:23,958
Guys, wh... [exhales]

1316
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:32,375
You don't hate me?

1317
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:35,666
No, I do. I just need to update
my Instagram story.

1318
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:38,083
Are you filming me right now?

1319

I'm pretty sure that we illegally won,
