The cub, 'but thee?' Pride of

00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:29,597
His earliest kill.

5
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,399
The jungle is large, and the

6
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,433
Cubby is small.

7
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:35,503
"Let him think and be still."

8
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,371
Do you hunt, Mr. Miller?

9
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,407
No.

10
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:40,608
Well, you ought to.

11
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:43,844
That quote was baloo teaching

12
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:47,515
Mowgli the law of the jungle.

13
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:51,452
Thank you for meeting,

14
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:53,087
Mr. Carson.

15
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,355
It was a pleasant surprise.

16
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,456
I wanted to meet the young

17
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,757
Man who, uh, took these

18
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,392
Pictures.

19
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,894
I'm very, uh, keen on emerging

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,862
Artists.

21
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,897
Collecting art is a...

22
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,798
Hobby of mine.

23
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,066
Well, I take it very

24
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,935
Seriously.

25
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,503
I'm glad you like them.

26
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,105
I do, but they confirm my

27
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,040
Suspicions.

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,477
There's a fire sale happening.

29
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:18,179
A going-out-of-business sale for

30
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,080
The baby-boom generation.

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,450
You know, I-i don't quite know

32
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,851
How we fucked up.

33
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,053
Maybe it was when we started

34
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,921
Giving you ribbons for

35
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,191
Participation or drugging you

36
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,726
Up at the least sign of

37
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,862
Discontent.

38
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,197
All you're qualified for is to

39
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:39,500
Live at home, keep a blog...

40
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,068
And persuade the rest of your

41
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,736
Entitled friends that your

42
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,505
Whimsical social commentaries

43
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,474
Are interesting.

44
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:49,042
These pictures don't...

45
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,911
Represent the rise of a new

46
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:51,879
Generation.

47
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,881
To me, you see, they perfectly

48
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,850
Capture its decline!

49
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:09,830
Recent data from the

50
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,064
Census bureau says that the

51
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,600
Income of the U.S. middle class

52
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,734
Is on the rise, although

53
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,902
Pollsters are telling the

54
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,170
Presidential candidates they

55
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,605
Could still use some help.

56
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,006
Senator mccain talked about an

57
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,174
Economic plan that would

58
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,942
Restore bottom-up economic

59
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,711
Growth, and senator Obama

60
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,579
Talked about economic growth

61
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,848
Designed from the ground up.

62
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:33,854
Thanks again.

63
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:34,722
It was his time.

64
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:35,223
Thank you.

65
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:35,823
Thanks.

66
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:36,990
I'll see you back at the house.

67
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,091
Thanks for coming, taking

68
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,193
Your time out of the office.

69
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,561
We'll see each other at the

House.

00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,929
I'll see you back there,

72
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:42,230
Okay?

73
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:42,963
Thanks so much.

74
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:43,664
Take care.

75
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,865
You know, we'll... we'll come

76
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:45,966
As much as we can, you know,

77
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,167
We'll make a great donation, and

78
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,536
We'll support the temple as much

79
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:48,969
As we can.

80
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:49,603
So sorry.

81
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:50,704
You know, I'm a busy guy.

82
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,072
Thank you.

83
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,842
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

84
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,544
Every, um, new beginning.

85
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,178
Some time now.

86
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,613
Yeah, I guess so.

Kid, fisher.

00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,186
This is Mr. and Mrs. Goodman.

91
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,121
Oh, right, yeah.

92
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,891
Sorry about your gramps.

00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:13,694
You all right?

95
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,528
Mm-hmm.

96
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,797
See you in the limo.

97
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,602
I thought the rabbi did a great

98
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:21,935
Job.

99
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,271
The service was beautiful.

100
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:24,738
Where was Kate at the

101
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,205
Funeral?

102
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,840
She was with her friends.

103
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,175
You'll see her back at the

104
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,843
House.

105
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,078
I was wondering if I could

106
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,613
Maybe stay with you two a little

107
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:33,747
Longer after ira leaves.

About transferring to a school

111
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,352
In the city, so it'd be really

112
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,721
Good to be close by.

113
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,188
Hmm?

114
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,790
I think Kate would enjoy

115
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,156
That.

116
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:43,824
Huh.

117
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,125
Huh.

How is your mom and your

Nowadays.

133
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,052
You don't have to tip-toe

134
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:12,853
Around him.

135
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,187

Let's not make this your

00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,927
Coming-out party.

Dad's will.

145
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,636
Take a year to get the audit

Hi.

How are you?

00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:49,790
I'm good. Thanks.

Um, dad?

Hmm?

161

Can you return these for me

00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:53,327
In the city?

163
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,962
No, because I have a job.

164
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,364
I go to an office, and I do

165
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:57,698
Something every day.

166
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,132
I need a dress for Dylan's

168
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,169
Okay, you will return them or

169
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,171
Give them to goodwill.

That's not a while, kid.

969
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:51,730
[Chuckles]

970
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,365
Do you ever wake and bake?

971
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,101
I used to love getting stoned in

972
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:55,734
The morning.

973
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,703
Yeah, occasionally.

974
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,438
[Blows]

975
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:03,475
Your parents know you smoke?

976
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,211
They know I smoke.

977
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:06,678
I know they smoke. [Chuckles]

978
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,614
We never talk about it, though.

979
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,116
I think my mom really likes

980
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:10,549
Smoking.

981
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,117
Mm.

982
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:12,418
My dad probably just got

983
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,120
Stoned so he could have sex with

984
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,586
A woman.

985
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,354
[Chuckles]

986
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,857
[Laughs]

987
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:18,858
Oh.

988
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:21,327
Fisher, I'm sorry.

989
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,862
God.

990
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,897
I used to love getting stoned

991
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:25,764
With your mom.

992
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,698
[Chuckles]

993
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,200
Thought you two hated each

994
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,600
Other.

995
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,870
Oh, we do but not always.

996
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,537
[Blows]

997
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,139
We went to Cornell together.

998
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,273
[Blows]

999
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,607
We used to party.

1000
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,176
[Blows]

1001
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:38,377
Does Kate smoke pot?

1002
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,246
[Chuckles] No.

1003
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:42,381
Definitely not.

1004
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:46,285
I don't think so. [Blows]

1005
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,187
She's pretty involved with her

1006
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:49,788
Boyfriends.

1007
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,824
[Sniffs] I understand that.

1008
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,292
[Sighs]

1009
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,895
Oh, great!

1010
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,796
Great.

1011
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,731
What?

1012
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,367
Funny, darling.

1013
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:03,735
Did you see the credit-card bill

1014
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,570
This month?

1015
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,238
We need to talk about Mary's

1016
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:07,874
Salary, and when you sober up...

1017
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:10,276
Phil, let's not do this right

1018
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:10,709
Now.

1019
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,478
[Sighs]

1020
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,617
Must be nice...

1021
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,352
Not having a job.

1022
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:21,620
[Clears throat] I'm sorry.

1023
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,421
What did you say?

1024
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,422
Are we gonna have this

1025
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,290
Conversation again?

1026
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,391
Who made this house?

1027
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:26,792
Who keeps this house nice for

1028
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,728
You 365 days of the year?

1029
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:32,631
You don't think that's work?

1030
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,600
I'm sorry, fisher. I'm sorry.

1031
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,368
That's okay.

1032
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:44,810
It's that promise that's

1033
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,346
Always set this country apart,

1034
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,814
That through hard work and

1035
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,616
Sacrifice, each of us can

1036
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:52,551
Pursue our individual dreams

1037
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,620
But still come together as one

1038
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,288
American family to ensure...

1039
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:56,956
Who cares?

1040
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:58,357
That the next generation

1041
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,525
Can pursue their dreams, as

1042
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,360
Well.

1043
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,428
That's why I stand here

1044
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:02,895
Tonight...

1045
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:03,729
[Chuckles]

1046
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:07,766
Because for 232 years at

1047
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:08,734
Each moment when that

1048
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:09,368
Promise...

1049
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,603
Give me Dylan Carson.

1050
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,105
[Chuckles]

1051
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,540
Students and soldiers,

1052
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,275
Farmers and teachers,

1053
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:17,109
Nurses and janitors...

1054
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,810
You're, uh, practically

1055
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,211
Naked.

1056
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,179
[Chuckles]

1057
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:21,047
Does that make you

1058
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,381
Uncomfortable?

1059
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,050
We meet at one of those

1060
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,051
Defining moments...

1061
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:25,717
I wonder what Kate's doing

1062
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,719
Now, do you think she's blown

1063
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,054
Him yet?

1064
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:28,854
Our economy is in

1065
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:29,488
Turmoil...

1066
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,656
She blew Todd on their first

1067
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,691
Date.

1068
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:33,825
That's my little cousin.

1069
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,661
Tonight, more Americans...

1070
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:37,529
Do you think that I should

1071
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,897
Blow you yet?

1072
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,632
More of you have lost your

1073
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,034
Homes, and even more are

1074
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,669
Watching your home values

1075
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:45,404
Plummet.

1076
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,605
More of you have cars you can't

1077
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,341
Afford to drive, credit cards,

1078
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:50,742
Bills you can't afford to pay,

1079
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,378
And tuition that's beyond your

1080
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:53,612
Reach.

1081
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,014
[Thud]

1082
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,382
Shit. Jesus fucking...

1083
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:56,748
[Laughing]

1084
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,050
These challenges are not all

1085
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,051
Of the government's making.

1086
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,052
Oh, my God.

1087
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:01,453
It's not fucking funny, all

1088
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,222
Right?!

1089
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:04,223
Just go jerk off on your

1090
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:05,724
Cousin's bed, you fucking freak!

1091
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:06,392
Shit.

1092
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:07,393
Of the broken politics in

1093
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:07,726
Washington...

1094
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:08,394
[Sighs]

1095
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:08,860
[Door slams]

1096
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,396
And the failed policies of

1097
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:11,030
George w...

1098
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,764
Can I just compliment you on

1099
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,632
Your product?

1100
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:14,700
It makes me go blind.

1101
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,002
Yeah, it's really fresh.

1102
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:17,669
It's, uh, from upstate New York,

1103
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,537
Where I'm from.

1104
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,272
[Sniffs]

1105
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,541
[Sighs] Boys.

1106
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,509
Pack it up again.

1107
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,810
We've got to get some pussy

1108
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,344
Here.

1109
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,778
I got a good stripper friend

1110
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,047
We could call if you want.

1111
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:28,880
Goodman!

1112
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,915
You got a guest!

1113
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,050
Is he all right?

1114
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,551
Oh, yeah, he's good.

1115
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:33,885
You sure?

1116
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,822
[Laughs]

1117
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,490
Okay.

1118
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,859
Now he will be... again.

1119
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:43,862
[Laughs]

1120
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,064
Eh.

1121
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:46,032
It's not bad.

1122
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:47,366
Here, add to it.

1123
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:48,467
No, I'm good.

1124
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,468
Add to it.

1125
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,402
I'm okay.

1126
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,871
Add to it.

1127
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:56,308
Okay.

1128
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,376
Boys, here, man.

1129
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:58,744
We're throwing a big bash

1130
00:32:58,744 --> 00:32:59,945
Here next week, fisher.

1131
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:00,746
[Laughter]

1132
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:01,713
Bring more weed.

1133
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:02,648
[Laughter]

1134
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,450
[Laughing] I'm gonna be

1135
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,617
Pissed at you now!

1136
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:06,652
[Laughter]

1137
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,920
[Bell chimes]

1138
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,561
Camera's broken.

1139
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:16,562
They can't fix it.

1140
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:18,097
Well, tell me you didn't lose

1141
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:19,865
My head shots.

1142
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,100
No, I didn't lose your head

1143
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,633
Shots.

1144
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:22,868
They were able to retrieve the

1145
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:26,038
Roll.

1146
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,107
[Sighs]

1147
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:30,576
You're welcome, Kate.

1148
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,847
I look amazing in these.

1149
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,516
Yeah, you do, but you

1150
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,886
Overshadow Jody.

1151
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,554
We need to find fish a new

1152
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:42,888
Bitch.

1153
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,423
No, every stupid college girl

1154
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:45,691
Is gonna want a piece of your

1155
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:46,958
Cousin with something green to

1156
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:47,659
Offer them.

1157
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:48,927
