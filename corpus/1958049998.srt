1
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:40,281
(dog barks in distance)

2
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:04,029
(rock music)

3
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:48,004
When are you gonna
fix my sink Bob?

4
00:01:48,073 --> 00:01:49,454
When are you
gonna pay your rent?

5
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:51,697
(rock music)

6
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:54,217
(music fades)

7
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:09,094
(car engine starts)

8
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:16,446
(rock music)

9
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:34,809
(Richie) Amanda.

10
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:36,328
I don't have time for
this Richie, I'm late.

11
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:38,779
Yeah, tell me about, I've
been out here waiting for you.

12
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:40,194
Okay.

13
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:42,265
What part of we're
through don't you get?

14
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:43,335
Oh, come on Amanda,
don't be like that.

15
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:44,440
No, don't touch me.

16
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:48,478
Amanda, it's just,
I miss you a lot.

17
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:49,755
Well, you should've
thought about that

18
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:50,825
before you stole the
money from my fridge.

19
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:52,102
So you're breaking up with me

20
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,483
because I borrowed
some money from you?

21
00:02:53,552 --> 00:02:54,519
Borrow?

22
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:56,279
You didn't borrow money Richie,

23
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:59,351
you stole my vintage
jar, my money.

24
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,559
10 Months worth of tips,

25
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:02,078
you stole it and
you bought a guitar.

26
00:03:02,147 --> 00:03:04,874
Hey, that guitar was a
steal. I had to act fast.

27
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:06,496
I mean, would you have given
me the money if I'd asked you?

28
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:07,773
- No.
- Yeah, see.

29
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:09,085
Besides, who keeps
their money in a fridge.

30
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:10,362
You ever heard of a bank?

31
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:11,984
I don't trust banks.

32
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:14,090
Right, yeah. You
don't trust banks.

33
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,816
You don't trust boyfriends.

34
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:19,095
I wonder if you even trust
yourself enough to love anybody.

35
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,583
Look, I'm gonna pay
you back, I promise.

36
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:26,378
The band is starting
to book some gigs,

37
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:28,656
so I'll just need to
come by your place later

38
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:31,176
and you know, pick
up the guitar.

39
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,695
(Amanda) Don't
bother, I'm selling it.

40
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:35,249
What? No, you can't do that.

41
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:36,664
Sure I can, I paid for it.

42
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:37,665
Okay.

43
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,736
Okay, I get it.

44
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,013
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:42,532
I should have asked
you first and I didn't

46
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:45,777
and now you're mad at me, but
you can't sell that guitar.

47
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:46,743
It's classic.

48
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:48,158
No, this is classic Richie.

49
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,506
I'm not doing it anymore.

50
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:57,651
I'll give you a month,

51
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,725
one month to buy back the
guitar and then you can keep it.

52
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:04,209
- (Richie) A month?
- Yeah.

53
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,486
(Richie) Where am I gonna
find that kind of money

54
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:06,763
in a month?

55
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:08,869
I don't know. You
ever heard of a bank?

56
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,803
(door closes)

57
00:04:11,872 --> 00:04:14,357
(tense music)

58
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:32,237
Well, well, well, look who
decided to show up today.

59
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,170
I know, I'm sorry.

60
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,067
- Mh
- hm.

61
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:39,037
Would you at least
like to hear my excuse?

62
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:39,969
Oh, I heard it.

63
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:41,867
You heard that?

64
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:43,524
- Mh
- hm.

65
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:45,906
But please, I don't
need any details

66
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,563
unless you're
abducted by aliens.

67
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:50,669
Were you abducted by aliens?

68
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,292
No.

69
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:55,847
Lucky aliens,
but really though,

70
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,159
this late thing is
getting to be a habit.

71
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:00,438
Keep it up and I'll
be forced to fire you.

72
00:05:00,507 --> 00:05:01,301
All right.

73
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,096
But you'd still be
my friend right?

74
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:05,788
Oh sure, I'm
not getting fired.

75
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,275
All right. Hold down
the Fort, please.

76
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,518
I need you to run
this to the bank.

77
00:05:11,587 --> 00:05:12,691
Where's Justin?

78
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,934
(Charlene) On a bakery run.

79
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:15,349
You know when he does that,

80
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:17,593
he takes a couple of
muffins for himself, right?

81
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:19,664
Well yeah, but I'll
sacrifice a muffin or two

82
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,873
for an employee that
shows up on time.

83
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:24,220
Besides, I deduct the
cost from his tips,

84
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:25,497
he hasn't figured it out.

85
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:29,294
(rock music)

86
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,109
Okay Mands, the
refills are done.

87
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:53,732
I'll try to contain
my excitement.

88
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,355
Stop calling me Mands.

89
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:56,252
Fine.

90
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,083
Amanda, I'm out of here.

91
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,119
I'll see you tomorrow.

92
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:02,879
Yep, I'm counting the hours.

93
00:06:06,124 --> 00:06:07,746
Don't even think
about it Justin.

94
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:13,856
(door opens, closes)

95
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,100
(Lily) Excuse me.

96
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:19,655
What can I get for you?

97
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:21,070
Are you Amanda James?

98
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:24,418
Who wants to know?

99
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,421
My name is Lily Stevenson.

100
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,285
I was wondering if
you had a minute.

101
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:34,773
Unless you're selling tin
mints, I'm not interested.

102
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:39,157
Okay, then I will have a
cafe latte with skimmed milk.

103
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,541
Is there a place we can talk?

104
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:46,820
It's about your father.

105
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,374
(tense music)

106
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,825
I don't know where he is.

107
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:53,827
Last I heard, he was
living somewhere upstate.

108
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,553
I know, that's
not why I'm here,

109
00:06:59,142 --> 00:07:00,834
Amanda, your father's dying.

110
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:05,804
So what?

111
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:09,394
You're here from some law firm
trying to settle his estate?

112
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,983
I don't want it,
give it to Goodwill.

113
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,435
How'd you find me here anyway?

114
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:18,921
The cafe's web page.

115
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,544
I hate the internet.

116
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:26,031
- I'm not from a law firm.
- Hank and I are friends.

117
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:31,002
You and my father are friends?

118
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:32,935
Yeah.

119
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,837
Actually, if it weren't for
Hank, I would be dead right now.

120
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:43,255
I was an addict and
he got me into AA

121
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:46,811
and just stood by me
through two relapses

122
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,952
until I eventually got sober.
He never gave up on me.

123
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:52,989
Lucky you.

124
00:07:56,717 --> 00:07:58,270
He helped save my life.

125
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:04,104
Okay. Well, what do you want?

126
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:09,903
Your liver, just a part of it.

127
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,839
- What are you?
- The walking dead.

128
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,704
Amanda, your father
has a liver disease

129
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:21,604
and his only chance is
to have a transplant.

130
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:23,364
Look, I don't know how
it is where you're from,

131
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:24,918
but around here

132
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:27,127
asking a complete stranger
for their internal organs

133
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:30,233
might be construed as,
I don't know, creepy.

134
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:35,238
I know it's terrible to dump
all this on you like this,

135
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,170
but I'm desperate.

136
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,483
He's on the transplant list

137
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,589
and he's running out of time.

138
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:42,038
And you think since
I'm his daughter,

139
00:08:42,107 --> 00:08:43,868
that I'd be a donor match?

140
00:08:46,353 --> 00:08:47,941
He didn't have the guts
to ask me himself, did he?

141
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,804
He sent you.

142
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:51,876
He didn't want you involved.

143
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:53,291
He would be really upset with me

144
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,603
if he knew I was doing this.

145
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:56,190
Look, I won't even
pretend to understand

146
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,434
what caused the rift
between the two of you.

147
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:00,298
Rift?

148
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:03,853
God, that's such an
interesting way of putting it.

149
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:08,927
I don't want to be
rude, but we're closing.

150
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:11,999
Yeah.

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,794
All right.

152
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:16,970
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

153
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:25,530
Hey girl scout,
4.75 for the latte.

154
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:28,775
Of course.

155
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:30,742
Here you go.

156
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:36,921
There you go.

157
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,785
FYI, I never said
I wouldn't do it.

158
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:41,684
(Lily) What?

159
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:43,790
I didn't say I
wouldn't get tested.

160
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:45,446
Then you will?

161
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:46,931
I didn't say that either.

162
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:53,869
Okay, look, here's
the doctor's number

163
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:56,561
and if you do decide to do it,

164
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,909
then just give them a call
and they'll set it all up

165
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:04,949
and thank you for
considering it.

166
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:08,159
Thanks.

167
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:11,300
(soft ambient music)

168
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,324
(door closes)

169
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:40,640
(keys clank)

170
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,088
(soft music)

171
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:26,893
(upbeat music)

172
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:31,760
Hey stranger.

173
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,248
Scotch rocks?

174
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,078
Am I that predictable?

175
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:42,771
What are you waiting for?

176
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,841
Pour.

177
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,429
(upbeat music)

178
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:54,265
Haven't seen you
in here for a while.

179
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:55,542
The prices you charge,

180
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:57,302
I'm surprised I can
be in here at all.

181
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,548
Well, you still get
me to pour your drink.

182
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:05,828
I guess it's okay.

183
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:14,285
Everything okay?

184
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:17,495
Yeah, why?

185
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:20,153
Well, for starters,

186
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:21,741
you're staring at a
card from a surgeon.

187
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:26,746
You tend bars long enough

188
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,540
and you get pretty good at
reading stuff upside down.

189
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:33,787
It's not for me.

190
00:12:35,582 --> 00:12:36,376
It's my dad.

191
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:40,035
He needs a liver transplant

192
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:41,899
and they want to see
if I'm a match, so.

193
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:44,694
Sorry about your dad.

194
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:49,665
But if you're a match,

195
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:52,495
at least you're giving him a
second chance at life right?

196
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:54,187
Good point.

197
00:12:57,328 --> 00:12:58,260
To second chances.

198
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:02,540
Second chances.

199
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:07,165
(melancholic music)

200
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:25,977
(Dr. Hogan) After
the procedure,

201
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:27,703
the portion of the
liver that we remove

202
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:29,256
will automatically regenerate.

203
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:33,191
You do this kind of
thing all the time?

204
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,641
(Dr. Hogan) Not exactly.

205
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,470
You see, most of the
patients that we diagnose

206
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:38,990
with collegial carcinoma
are over the age of 50.

207
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:43,305
So finding a viable donor in
time is next to impossible.

208
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:47,067
To be completely
honest with you.

209
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:49,725
Most people die before
a donor can be found.

210
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:53,798
Oh.

211
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,180
However, having a family
member as a potential candidate

212
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:58,389
does increase the
odds dramatically.

213
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:03,325
So how does this
kind of thing work?

214
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,638
Well first, we'll do a test

215
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:09,710
to make sure that your liver
is healthy enough to operate.

216
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,643
You annotated here
on your history,

217
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:13,473
a high level of
alcohol consumption.

218
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,615
You say high, I say normal.

219
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:21,412
Well, according to the
AMA, your normal is our high,

220
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:23,241
but a biopsy will
tell us for sure.

221
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,450
Biopsy?

222
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:28,039
Great.

223
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:29,869
It's just a simple
outpatient procedure.

224
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:31,940
It does require a needle though.

225
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:35,150
After that, it's just a
matter of some blood tests

226
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:37,531
to screen for viruses,
a routine physical

227
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,430
and a psych evaluation.

228
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:41,156
A psych evaluation?

229
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:43,054
- (Dr. Hogan) Yes.
- It's just protocol.

230
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:44,400
Just to make sure
that the candidate

231
00:14:44,469 --> 00:14:46,575
doesn't feel pressured
into donating.

232
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:48,715
People do that?

233
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,891
Desperate people will
do almost anything.

234
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:56,896
Well, you better
get back to work.

235
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:59,277
(Dr. Hogan) Absolutely.

236
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:01,486
I'm gonna have Tina out
front schedule your tests

237
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:05,180
and make sure that everything
goes well for your biopsy.

238
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:08,148
In the meantime, follow
those instructions for me.

239
00:15:08,217 --> 00:15:09,978
Go easy on the sauce.

240
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:11,462
Got it.

241
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:12,808
Should have your results
in about a week or so.

242
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,916
And if it turns
out I'm not a match.

243
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:21,748
Then most likely your father
doesn't finish out the year.

244
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:24,302
(tense music)

245
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:44,909
(Justin hums)

246
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:52,089
Justin, Justin, Justin.

247
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:58,509
Do you mind? I'm
trying to study.

248
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,305
I don't get you.

249
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:03,134
Why'd you go back to school
if you don't have to?

250
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:05,516
Because I want to do something
with my life besides this.

251
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:07,967
Yeah but Law school.

252
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:09,727
Well, what are you
gonna do with that?

253
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:10,970
What do you think?

254
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,695
I'm gonna make cheesy
commercials, sue people

255
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,283
and buy Alexis.

256
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:15,146
That's cool.

257
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:17,045
I guess.

258
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:19,564
What about you, Amanda?

259
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:22,119
You're gonna fly off to
Venice and start a new life?

260
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:25,260
I'll let you know
when I get there.

261
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,295
If I ever get there.

262
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:29,195
Hey Mands.

263
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:32,336
Ever since you dumped Richie,
he's been super bummed out.

264
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,476
I've never seen him this low.

265
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:36,547
Save it for somebody
who cares, Justin.

266
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:41,483
(phone beeps)

267
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:43,312
I'm telling you,
Richie's just moping around

268
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:45,487
with that sad puppy
dog look of his.

269
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:47,696
- Well.
- You know.

270
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,594
No, no, I don't know.

271
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,392
Oh, well it's
kind of like this.

272
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:56,981
- That's not a sad puppy.
- That's a constipated one.

273
00:16:58,086 --> 00:16:59,363
What do you know.

274
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:01,158
I know what a
constipated dog looks like.

275
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:03,125
And I know that guys
like Richie never change.

276
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:04,782
No man, you're wrong.

277
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:06,646
He's getting his act together.

278
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:07,888
Sure.

279
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:10,374
And maybe I'm wrong
about my ex-husband too.

280
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:12,134
Any minute now he could
walk through that door

281
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:14,136
with five years worth
of back child support

282
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:16,138
and tell me that he
actually wants to spend time

283
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:17,070
with his daughter.

284
00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:20,694
I could be wrong, but I'm not.

285
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:27,391
(Dr. Hogan) I got your
test results, you're a match.

286
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,462
Are you sure?

287
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:30,497
(Dr. Hogan) Positive.

288
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,638
(tense music)

289
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,537
Amanda, are you still there?

290
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:39,368
Yeah, I'm here.

291
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:40,611
(Dr. Hogan) Okay.

292
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,820
Now I just need you both
to sign consent forms.

293
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:45,305
Then we can schedule
the surgery.

294
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:47,031
Your father's available
tomorrow at two.

295
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,895
Will that work for you?

296
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:50,345
I'll make it work.

297
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:51,311
(Dr. Hogan) Great,
I'll let your father know

298
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,554
we're on for tomorrow.

299
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:56,144
Okay, thank you.

300
00:17:58,318 --> 00:17:59,699
Hey, I need you out front.

301
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:02,184
Yeah, I'm coming.

302
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,053
I need to take off a
little early tomorrow.

303
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,055
I have a doctor's appointment.

304
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,263
Again?

305
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:13,471
That's like the third
one in two weeks.

306
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,714
Are you sick?

307
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:17,544
No, I'm fine, I just
need to take off early.

308
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:19,477
Is that cool?

309
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:23,171
No, no, it's not
unless you tell me why.

310
00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:25,173
I just did.

311
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:28,279
Look, the only reason
you still have a job here

312
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,074
is because we're friends.

313
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,696
I put up with a lot from
you and you know it.

314
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:34,182
So if you want a
favor, I need a reason.

315
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:38,876
Fine.

316
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:39,773
It's my dad.

317
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,259
He needs a liver transplant.

318
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:43,950
I've been doing tests
to see if I'm a match

319
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:48,196
it turns out I am, so lucky me.

320
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:49,266
A liver transplant?

321
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:52,200
Girl, if you're just
gonna make up an excuse.

322
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:54,719
You should definitely go with
something more plausible.

323
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:01,209
Are you serious?

324
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:05,627
I'm so sorry.

325
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:08,250
I had no idea.

326
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,049
Well, is this why
you needed time off?

327
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:15,499
Why didn't you just tell me?

328
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:20,883
I've known you for years.

329
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,437
You've never even
mentioned your family.

330
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:26,924
I don't know, like
this transplant thing.

331
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:32,274
I can finally have
a second chance

332
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:34,932
to put some things
behind me, move forward.

333
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:40,558
Got to make the
best of it I guess.

334
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:50,499
(Claire) You totally stole
that from a Hallmark movie.

335
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:55,746
(soft music)

336
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:56,816
But I got to do it.

337
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:01,234
Call me and let me
know how it goes, okay.

338
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:08,793
(soft music)

339
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:41,964
(upbeat music)

340
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:42,896
(Woman On Radio)
Love you guys.

341
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:44,035
I'm listening to you at home.

342
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:46,106
(upbeat music)

343
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:49,213
(indistinct chatter)

344
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:55,564
(soft ambient music)

345
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:05,781
(footsteps approach)

346
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,888
(soft ambient music)

347
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:27,320
Amanda, there you are.

348
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:28,597
Sorry I'm late.

349
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,598
Everything okay?

350
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,013
Yeah, I'm good.

351
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,014
Alright. This is
pastor Clairemont Miller.

352
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,119
She's gonna be joining us today.

353
00:21:33,188 --> 00:21:34,638
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

354
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:36,433
Please call me Claire.

355
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:40,437
St. Francis has pastors
on call when requested.

356
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:41,748
I didn't ask for one.

357
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:44,130
No, you're right,
but your father did.

358
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,338
I've been counseling Hank

359
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:47,789
since he's been in
town for the procedure.

360
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:50,481
Claire will also serve
as our official witness.

361
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:54,727
Okay.

362
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:55,797
Shall we?

363
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:56,660
All right.

364
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,734
(tense music)

365
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,885
It's so good to see
you again. Thank you.

366
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:25,413
You knew about this?

367
00:22:25,482 --> 00:22:26,345
Yeah.

368
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:29,831
You shouldn't have done this.

369
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,728
Hey dad.

370
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,041
Surprised to see me?

371
00:22:35,457 --> 00:22:36,285
Yeah.

372
00:22:39,116 --> 00:22:41,808
I hear pastor Claire's
been counseling you.

373
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:42,982
(Hank) Yes.

374
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:47,296
We've had some wonderful
conversations over coffee.

375
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,746
The man knows his scripture.

376
00:22:49,678 --> 00:22:50,438
Yeah, it's funny.

377
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:51,956
He used to say that...

378
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:53,510
What was it?

379
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,962
The Bible was only made for
frightened superstitious people.

380
00:22:58,963 --> 00:22:59,757
Was that it dad?

381
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,347
I bet you must be pretty
frightened right now.

382
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,286
I think we're getting
off on the wrong foot here.

383
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:16,291
Yes, don't worry, it's
just nerves I think.

384
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,984
(clears throat)

385
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:22,055
Any questions about
the consent forms?

386
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:32,549
So, Lily tells me
that you are sober now.

387
00:23:33,308 --> 00:23:33,791
(Hank) Yes, I am.

388
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:41,316
- That's so interesting.
- And that you found God.

389
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,734
And in ways we still
don't understand.

390
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:49,048
He seems to have given
Hank a second chance.

391
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:54,433
I just told my friend the
exact same thing yesterday.

392
00:23:56,745 --> 00:24:00,439
I think this is
my second chance.

393
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:02,889
(rock music)

394
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:10,138
(tense music)

395
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:11,829
I don't understand.

396
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,285
Do you want to tell
her dad or should I?

397
00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:21,805
(tense music)

398
00:24:23,082 --> 00:24:25,153
All these years and
you're still a coward.

399
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:27,673
(Hank) Please stop.

400
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:28,501
Why?

401
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,398
You didn't.

402
00:24:31,573 --> 00:24:32,850
It's funny, you used
to have a power over me

403
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:35,232
and then some like
cosmic shift happened

404
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:37,061
and now I have the
power over you.

405
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:40,340
I think we need
to take a step back.

406
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:43,067
This is starting to get ugly.

407
00:24:43,136 --> 00:24:43,965
(Amanda) Ugly?

408
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:48,314
Ugly. You don't
know the half of it

409
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:54,354
Lily tells me you two
are close friends.

410
00:24:54,423 --> 00:24:56,046
How close is close
would you say?

411
00:24:57,703 --> 00:25:00,084
Did he tell you that
when I was eight

412
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:01,569
after my mom had passed

413
00:25:01,638 --> 00:25:05,193
and then I got the courage
to finally run away from home

414
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:08,092
when I was 17, that he
would come home drunk.

415
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:11,855
He would pull my nightgown
up around my neck,

416
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,169
pull my underwear down and
force himself inside of me.

417
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:21,036
Then all the while telling me

418
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:24,108
how much of a good
little girl I am.

419
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:26,179
And this is what
good little girls do

420
00:25:27,836 --> 00:25:29,528
to please their daddies.

421
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:30,598
Did he tell you that?

422
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:33,014
Did you tell her that dad?

423
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,605
No.

424
00:25:37,674 --> 00:25:38,951
He brushed over that part.

425
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:43,231
Amanda, you seem
upset, why don't we...

426
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,509
Go outside, get
some fresh air?

427
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:46,959
I'm good.

428
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:47,856
Thank you.

429
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,036
So now you think that
all these years later,

430
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:57,107
I'm just gonna come
in here and save you?

431
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,076
Look at me.

432
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:03,631
(tense music)

433
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:07,220
this is what your good
little girl looks like.

434
00:26:09,257 --> 00:26:10,638
She's not gonna save you.

435
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:14,883
(tense ambient music)

436
00:26:17,437 --> 00:26:18,611
Call me for the funeral.

437
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:21,580
You want to attend?

438
00:26:22,753 --> 00:26:24,099
No.

439
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:26,930
There's a nice bottle of
scotch I've been saving it for.

440
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:28,207
Amanda.

441
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:30,347
Nope, whatever
cliche Bible verse

442
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:32,452
you're gonna spit out at
me right now, just don't.

443
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:36,940
(door opens, closes)

444
00:26:45,742 --> 00:26:46,812
Amanda, wait.

445
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:49,469
Didn't we just do this?

446
00:26:49,538 --> 00:26:52,438
You have every right
to be hurt and angry,

447
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:54,371
but this is no way to fix it.

448
00:26:56,753 --> 00:26:59,307
What makes you think
I need to be fixed?

449
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:00,791
He deserves to die.

450
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,517
And I promise you
when his time comes,

451
00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:04,208
he will be held accountable.

452
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:07,902
Accountable.

453
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:09,697
What is it with
you church people?

454
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:12,354
You know that man have been
counseling is a liar, right?

455
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:13,942
So if you want to
believe that little crap,

456
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:15,599
then be my guest.

457
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:16,773
You're right.

458
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:18,119
All I can do is take it on faith

459
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:19,707
that he's truly a changed man.

460
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:22,088
Do you have kids Claire?

461
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:23,572
- (Claire) I do.
- Do me a favor.

462
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,022
Next time you go on vacation,

463
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:26,265
leave your girls with my father

464
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:27,542
and see how that
works out for you

465
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:29,302
since you have so much
faith in him and all.

466
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:32,340
My faith is in God.

467
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:39,209
Where was God
when I needed Him

468
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:41,418
to save me from my
own father, huh?

469
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:42,868
What does that say about me?

470
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:44,801
That none of this matters,
that I don't matter?

471
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,009
Come on, pastor.

472
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:47,596
You're supposed to
have all the answers.

473
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:51,635
That's what I thought.

474
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:57,261
Keep your God.

475
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:00,023
I don't need Him.

476
00:28:02,888 --> 00:28:05,684
(elevator buzzes)

477
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:09,929
(eerie music)

478
00:28:36,576 --> 00:28:39,131
(upbeat music)

479
00:28:49,658 --> 00:28:52,316
You might want to
slow down a little bit.

480
00:28:52,385 --> 00:28:54,146
I'm celebrating.

481
00:28:54,215 --> 00:28:55,492
(Bartender)
What's the occasion?

482
00:28:56,665 --> 00:28:58,702
Second chances.

483
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:02,050
Oh, you mean that
thing with your father?

484
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:04,915
That's great. Good for you.

485
00:29:06,503 --> 00:29:08,505
Yeah, good for me.

486
00:29:08,574 --> 00:29:11,163
(upbeat music)

487
00:29:12,647 --> 00:29:13,717
You know, the world would
be a whole lot better off

488
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,236
if more people were like you.

489
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:19,343
(phone vibrates)

490
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:25,315
A friend coming down here
to celebrate with you?

491
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:31,010
No, just me.

492
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:34,738
(upbeat instrumental music)

493
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:47,820
(Amanda groans)

494
00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:50,547
(ambient music)

495
00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:55,759
(upbeat rock music)

496
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:17,436
You're late.

497
00:30:17,505 --> 00:30:18,506
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

498
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:22,061
Hey, how'd it go? I
tried calling last night.

499
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,097
Have you seen your dad?

500
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:24,132
He's fine.

501
00:30:26,445 --> 00:30:28,171
What can I get for you?

502
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,381
(tense ambient music)

503
00:31:12,801 --> 00:31:15,874
(instrumental music)

504
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:54,843
(soft music)

505
00:31:58,882 --> 00:32:00,263
Hey, when's your
dad's surgery?

506
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:02,713
I need to schedule
a cover for you.

507
00:32:02,782 --> 00:32:06,027
Man, I wish someone needed
my liver. That'd be sick.

508
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:08,271
You told him?

509
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:12,068
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize it was a secret.

510
00:32:12,137 --> 00:32:14,794
I wouldn't have told you
if you hadn't forced me to.

511
00:32:14,863 --> 00:32:17,349
Chill Mands, you're
gonna be a hero.

512
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:18,695
I can see it now.

513
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:20,904
Daughters saves father's life.

514
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,457
Shut up, Justin.

515
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,701
Don't you have something
you can do in the kitchen?

516
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,944
No.

517
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:27,221
Well, can you find
something please?

518
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,636
I'm just trying
to be supportive.

519
00:32:28,705 --> 00:32:31,121
Okay, go support
stacking inventory.

520
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,020
Okay, okay, geez.

521
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:44,100
- I'm sorry, okay.
- I didn't know.

522
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:47,620
So what are the dates
that you need off?

523
00:32:47,689 --> 00:32:49,277
Don't worry about it.

524
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:50,554
Well, it's my job
to worry about it.

525
00:32:50,623 --> 00:32:52,453
So do you need the
time off or not?

526
00:32:52,522 --> 00:32:53,316
Not.

527
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:57,285
Look, since I didn't
ask for your opinion,

528
00:32:57,354 --> 00:33:00,323
then I don't have to
give you an excuse.

529
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:04,637
(Charlene) Is
everything all right?

530
00:33:04,706 --> 00:33:05,707
Everything's fine.

531
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,503
People need to stay
out of my business.

532
00:33:10,126 --> 00:33:12,335
Well, you sort of
involve me in your business

533
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:14,509
when you bring your
business into my business.

534
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:16,373
So what happened?

535
00:33:16,442 --> 00:33:17,616
Can you just leave it?

536
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,378
No I can't, I care about you.

537
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:25,037
I never asked you to.

538
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:27,488
(soft music)

539
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:48,992
Wow.

540
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:51,857
I've got to give you
points for perseverance.

541
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:55,412
You really don't know how to
take no for an answer, do you?

542
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:59,313
You can have a career
in sales, telemarketing.

543
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:01,315
You could sell
timeshares in Florida.

544
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:06,527
Funny, snippy but funny.

545
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:08,080
If you're here to
ask me to reconsider,

546
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:09,909
you're wasting your time.
I'm not changing my mind.

547
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:11,532
That's not why I'm here.

548
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:12,774
I'm not too concerned

549
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,190
with whether Hank gets
a transplant or not.

550
00:34:14,259 --> 00:34:17,020
I mean, we're all gonna
die of something, right?

551
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:19,436
I take it back, you're
a terrible salesman.

552
00:34:19,505 --> 00:34:21,611
I would not buy
timeshares from you.

553
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,957
Where did you get
your pastor's license?

554
00:34:23,026 --> 00:34:24,372
A box of cracker jacks?

555
00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:25,960
You got something
against cracker jacks?

556
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:26,857
No.

557
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:30,758
Okay, well, if you're not
asking me to reconsider,

558
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:31,966
then why are you here?

559
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:38,179
Something you said the other
day struck a nerve with me.

560
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:43,219
For a long time, I felt
like I was damaged goods.

561
00:34:44,427 --> 00:34:46,187
Sometimes I still
feel like that I am.

562
00:34:47,188 --> 00:34:48,638
(Amanda) What happened?

563
00:34:48,707 --> 00:34:49,777
Did your boyfriend break
up with you on prom night?

564
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:51,227
I killed my little sister.

565
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:56,991
I was 16, the ink was still
wet on my driver's license.

566
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:01,168
Julie needed paint
for a school project

567
00:35:01,237 --> 00:35:03,273
and I begged my parents
to let me drive her

568
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:04,895
to the craft store.

569
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:08,036
(emotive music)

570
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,590
I was fiddling with the radio

571
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:12,351
and never saw the light in
the intersection turn red.

572
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:17,943
Julie was killed instantly,
me, not a scratch

573
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,083
on the outside.

574
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:27,435
It shattered my parents and
they split up a year later.

575
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:28,402
That was my fault.

576
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:34,753
It was my fault and I
hated myself for it.

577
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:38,653
I was in a dark place
for a long time.

578
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,417
I'm sorry.

579
00:35:43,486 --> 00:35:47,731
Is this the part where you
found God and you changed?

580
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,802
I'm just trying to keep up.

581
00:35:50,907 --> 00:35:52,391
I'm just saying

582
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,291
your past does not have to
define who you can become.

583
00:35:57,293 --> 00:35:59,295
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah.

584
00:35:59,364 --> 00:36:00,813
What is that?

585
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:02,746
Quote number 37 from the
Christian book of cliches.

586
00:36:02,815 --> 00:36:04,162
I don't, I don't care.

587
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:07,889
I'm sorry about your
sister, I really am.

588
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,892
But you don't know me.

589
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:11,824
You don't know what
I'm going through.

590
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:13,309
What I'm still going through.

591
00:36:14,517 --> 00:36:16,553
You want to know why I
ran away when I was 17?

592
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,349
I was pregnant with his.

593
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,423
I had a miscarriage
and it was bad

594
00:36:27,254 --> 00:36:29,394
and now I can't have children.

595
00:36:29,463 --> 00:36:32,431
(melancholic music)

596
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:35,503
That man is a monster.

597
00:36:37,954 --> 00:36:40,267
What kind of God forgives
somebody like him?

598
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,477
I'm so sorry.

599
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:49,517
Look, I know you're here
because you want to help me,

600
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:51,312
but do me a favor,
go home to your kids.

601
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:52,831
They need you, I don't.

602
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,153
(car door closes)

603
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,295
(soft ambient music)

604
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,286
(car door closes)

605
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:08,113
(soft ambient music)

606
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:49,499
Amanda.

607
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:55,988
What are you doing here?

608
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:58,715
Oh, duh.

609
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,788
I guess it was too much to hope

610
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:05,170
that maybe you came to say you
wanted to get back together.

611
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:09,933
I'm gonna need to see your ID.

612
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,522
Seriously?

613
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:14,904
Yeah, Policy.

614
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:35,649
- Would you look at that.
- Me giving you more money.

615
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:38,065
You know, I got this job

616
00:39:38,134 --> 00:39:40,826
so that I could buy
back the guitar.

617
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:47,523
(instrumental music)

618
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,735
Listen, I just want to say that

619
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:59,535
you know that I'm not
mad at you anymore.

620
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:03,331
I was, you know, mad

621
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,890
I thought you and I kind of
had something there, you know?

622
00:40:11,305 --> 00:40:13,652
I mean, up until you
went all ballistic on me,

623
00:40:16,172 --> 00:40:17,173
that was messed up.

624
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:21,488
That's me, messed up.

625
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:25,768
But I'm not wrong, am I?

626
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:31,256
There were moments when things
were okay between us, right?

627
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:34,362
Yeah, I guess.

628
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,088
Usually when we were both drunk.

629
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:41,508
Wow, that didn't say
much for us, does it?

630
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:47,479
Guess I should say thanks.

631
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:49,550
Why?

632
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:51,863
When you broke up with me,

633
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:54,417
I don't feel like
drinking so much anymore.

634
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,454
I'm a whole lot more
focused on the band.

635
00:40:57,662 --> 00:41:00,699
So I guess that's
progress, right?

636
00:41:05,877 --> 00:41:08,500
(ambient music)

637
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:44,881
(knock on door)

638
00:41:56,859 --> 00:41:59,896
It would be easier
to get rid of herpes.

639
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:02,209
I was just in
the neighborhood.

640
00:42:02,278 --> 00:42:04,038
No you weren't.

641
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:07,697
No I wasn't, you're right.

642
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:11,632
Well, it is technically
my happy hour.

643
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:13,841
So unless you care to join me.

644
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,049
Actually I would.

645
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:18,018
Okay.

646
00:42:22,678 --> 00:42:25,163
(door closes)

647
00:42:28,925 --> 00:42:31,134
It's funny, I didn't
know Pastor's drank.

648
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:32,653
Oh, we prefer wine.

649
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:48,773
This could peel paint.

650
00:42:49,877 --> 00:42:53,018
(Claire chuckles)

651
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:53,950
Why are you here?

652
00:42:55,193 --> 00:42:56,263
And no sermons.

653
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:58,679
No sermons.

654
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,819
An apology actually.

655
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:08,137
I'm sorry I made
you feel like a...

656
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:09,517
A reclamation project?

657
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,214
You brought up some deep stuff

658
00:43:16,283 --> 00:43:18,596
that I thought I had
dealt with a long time ago

659
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:21,599
and I know it's not the same.

660
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,743
I thought I could heal
myself by helping you.

661
00:43:27,812 --> 00:43:30,711
And you remembered
I can't do that.

662
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:36,303
Okay. So what is the
point of being a Christian

663
00:43:36,372 --> 00:43:38,616
if you're just as messed
up as the rest of us?

664
00:43:39,962 --> 00:43:41,135
I don't get it.

665
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:42,378
Like I know you
think my calling

666
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:45,208
is to run around saving
people, but it's not.

667
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:49,868
It's simply to meet people
right where they are.

668
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:57,289
And I lost track of
that and I'm sorry.

669
00:43:59,775 --> 00:44:03,261
(soft ambient music)

670
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,366
Trust me, I am usually
much better at this.

671
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,887
Trusting is not one
of my strong suits.

672
00:44:09,785 --> 00:44:12,822
(soft ambient music)

673
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:15,100
Well, thanks for the drink

674
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:18,345
and not slamming
the door in my face.

675
00:44:19,277 --> 00:44:21,279
- Well, it was a 50
- 50 chance.

676
00:44:24,006 --> 00:44:27,043
But I wanted you to have
my contact information.

677
00:44:27,112 --> 00:44:28,666
I'm not gonna bother you again.

678
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:33,912
You don't even have to use it,

679
00:44:33,981 --> 00:44:35,880
but if you need
anything, I'm here.

680
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:39,262
Just, here.

681
00:44:44,923 --> 00:44:47,581
(soft ambient music)

682
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,722
(door opens, closes)

683
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:54,415
(soft music)

684
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:03,174
Bob, you have one
job. Fix my sink.

685
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:34,861
Gosh, no.

686
00:46:53,638 --> 00:46:56,227
(upbeat music)

687
00:46:59,161 --> 00:47:00,334
Well, don't you look.

688
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:01,957
Don't be a jerk.

689
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,236
Someone who needs a drink.

690
00:47:05,305 --> 00:47:06,133
Yes.

691
00:47:08,135 --> 00:47:08,895
Rough week?

692
00:47:10,344 --> 00:47:11,173
You tell me.

693
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,348
I was late to work, I
got chewed up by my boss.

694
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:15,902
And I got stalked by a pastor.

695
00:47:15,971 --> 00:47:17,420
(Trey) Stalked by a pastor?

696
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:18,318
Yes.

697
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,875
And the landlord is on my case
for rent, which I don't have.

698
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:26,913
He is too lazy to fix my
broken faucet, which I do have.

699
00:47:26,982 --> 00:47:29,639
And my ex-boyfriend thanked
me for breaking up with him

700
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,503
because apparently
I'm the reason

701
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:33,229
that he was drinking too much.

702
00:47:38,303 --> 00:47:39,132
Wow.

703
00:47:41,997 --> 00:47:45,138
I mean, most people come in
here with cancer or divorce,

704
00:47:45,207 --> 00:47:48,624
but you are a whole new level.

705
00:47:49,694 --> 00:47:51,351
See, there you
go being a jerk.

706
00:47:52,283 --> 00:47:53,146
Sue me.

707
00:47:53,215 --> 00:47:55,596
(rock music)

708
00:47:57,253 --> 00:47:59,428
Why is all of this
happening to me?

709
00:47:59,497 --> 00:48:01,809
(Trey) It's gonna
get better, you'll see.

710
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:04,467
Are you sure?

711
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:07,815
Look at all the good
karma you're storing up.

712
00:48:09,024 --> 00:48:10,957
The transplant and all.

713
00:48:11,026 --> 00:48:13,166
A good deed like that
can't go unrewarded.

714
00:48:13,235 --> 00:48:16,824
So, just hang in there.

715
00:48:19,344 --> 00:48:20,898
Right. Hang in there.

716
00:48:28,112 --> 00:48:30,804
You don't have to be so
tough all the time you know.

717
00:48:33,462 --> 00:48:34,635
It's just easier.

718
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:35,533
Than feeling?

719
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:37,604
There's no way to live.

720
00:48:39,261 --> 00:48:40,365
It's just me.

721
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:42,989
(upbeat music)

722
00:48:50,237 --> 00:48:51,583
I'm sorry.

723
00:48:51,652 --> 00:48:53,654
I have a lot on my plate.

724
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:56,312
(upbeat music)

725
00:49:01,214 --> 00:49:02,111
So Trey,

726
00:49:03,595 --> 00:49:06,978
I don't suppose you know how
to fix a broken sink, do you?

727
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:13,295
I'm not much of a handyman.

728
00:49:14,468 --> 00:49:19,197
Hey, just call a plumber
and problem solved.

729
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:23,615
Right, problem solved.

730
00:49:43,497 --> 00:49:46,569
(calm ambient music)

731
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:31,476
Hey Mands.

732
00:50:33,444 --> 00:50:34,514
You don't look so hot.

733
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,034
I'm fine.

734
00:50:37,103 --> 00:50:39,036
You want to mind
your own business?

735
00:50:39,105 --> 00:50:40,313
Stop calling me Mands.

736
00:50:47,389 --> 00:50:48,286
Excuse me.

737
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:52,877
I ordered a latte
with almond milk.

738
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:56,984
Okay.

739
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:57,916
This has soy.

740
00:51:03,681 --> 00:51:05,338
Tastes fine to me.

741
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:06,891
Okay, but they're different.

742
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,204
They're different?

743
00:51:09,273 --> 00:51:10,446
How so?

744
00:51:10,515 --> 00:51:11,930
Do you want to explain to me

745
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,036
the difference between
soy milk and almond milk?

746
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:15,279
How about you just clock in,

747
00:51:15,348 --> 00:51:18,247
since you seem to know
the difference so well.

748
00:51:18,316 --> 00:51:21,561
Why am I even having this
conversation with you right now?

749
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,356
I'll make you a
new one, no prob.

750
00:51:23,425 --> 00:51:27,394
Almond milk latte and a
blueberry scone on the house.

751
00:51:27,463 --> 00:51:29,948
(tense music)

752
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:35,333
What was that?

753
00:51:35,402 --> 00:51:36,852
What was what?

754
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:39,889
Oh, don't get cute with
me Amanda, this is serious.

755
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:42,029
You know, I've put up
with a lot from you,

756
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,514
let a lot of things slide.

757
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:46,793
You're late, you're angry
and now you're drunk

758
00:51:46,862 --> 00:51:48,243
picking fights
with the customers.

759
00:51:48,312 --> 00:51:50,003
Come on, I'm not drunk.

760
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:51,453
Seriously, you'd put that on me.

761
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:52,695
You're supposed to my friend.

762
00:51:52,764 --> 00:51:55,042
Oh please, don't
play the friend card.

763
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,804
Friends don't treat each
other the way you treat me.

764
00:51:57,873 --> 00:51:59,392
Was your dad even sick?

765
00:51:59,461 --> 00:52:02,119
No, no, no operation right?

766
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:03,258
Exactly.

767
00:52:03,327 --> 00:52:04,535
Wanted a little time off.

768
00:52:04,604 --> 00:52:06,709
Made it all up, knowing
that I would believe you

769
00:52:06,778 --> 00:52:07,986
give it to you.

770
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:09,540
Listen, I know I
messed up all right.

771
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:11,473
I'll go back in and
apologize, I won't do it again.

772
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:12,646
No, that's not necessary.

773
00:52:12,715 --> 00:52:13,544
You're done.

774
00:52:17,824 --> 00:52:19,308
Are you firing me?

775
00:52:19,377 --> 00:52:20,171
Yeah.

776
00:52:21,068 --> 00:52:22,967
I need this job.

777
00:52:23,036 --> 00:52:24,486
I don't care.

778
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:26,039
You're gonna ruin our
friendship just like that?

779
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:27,765
Oh yeah, I'm ruining it.

780
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:28,662
Yeah.

781
00:52:31,665 --> 00:52:32,804
It's never you, is it?

782
00:52:35,393 --> 00:52:36,394
No, I guess not.

783
00:52:36,463 --> 00:52:40,191
(door opens, closes)

784
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,642
(soft music)

785
00:53:01,902 --> 00:53:05,112
You'll have your rent
when you fix my sink.

786
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,667
(eerie music)

787
00:53:13,017 --> 00:53:14,536
Amanda, I need you.

788
00:53:14,605 --> 00:53:15,675
I'm not doing this.

789
00:53:15,744 --> 00:53:18,367
(ambient music)

790
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:57,682
(knock on door)

791
00:53:57,751 --> 00:53:59,028
(Hank) Amanda.

792
00:53:59,097 --> 00:54:01,203
No, go away or I'm
calling the police.

793
00:54:02,377 --> 00:54:05,345
(Hank) Okay, I'll go.

794
00:54:05,414 --> 00:54:10,350
I promise, I'll go, but I
need to tell you something.

795
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:13,250
Save your breath, you're
getting what you deserve.

796
00:54:17,184 --> 00:54:19,911
(Amanda breathes sharply)

797
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,189
I know I am honey.

798
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,260
I know I am.

799
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:32,959
I let everyone think that I
had completed all the 12 steps

800
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,686
in recovery hun, but I
didn't, it was a lie.

801
00:54:37,204 --> 00:54:39,483
I didn't complete
step number nine.

802
00:54:41,692 --> 00:54:46,593
It's the one where you
make a deliberate attempt

803
00:54:47,905 --> 00:54:51,218
to amend any harm that
you've done to anyone

804
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:56,258
that's out there except when
it does more damage to them.

805
00:54:58,398 --> 00:55:02,851
Except when it injures
them more and you see,

806
00:55:04,266 --> 00:55:08,339
I convinced myself that
trying to make amends with you

807
00:55:08,408 --> 00:55:10,997
would injure you more than
what I'd already done.

808
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:14,276
And that was wrong.

809
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:15,277
That was a lie.

810
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:24,804
The truth is that I was afraid.

811
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:26,806
I was afraid to face you.

812
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:29,153
I was afraid to admit
what I had done.

813
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,401
Like you said, I'm
still a coward.

814
00:55:41,545 --> 00:55:44,686
But I can't run from it
anymore Amanda, not anymore.

815
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:50,243
Not now, I'm out of time.

816
00:55:56,905 --> 00:55:58,734
Look, you were right.

817
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:04,982
I never believed in hell but
as much as it terrifies me

818
00:56:10,194 --> 00:56:11,713
to think of that.

819
00:56:12,955 --> 00:56:14,440
I would go there

820
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:17,719
if I knew that it
meant that I could undo

821
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:20,446
everything that
I've done to you.

822
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:24,933
(instrumental music)

823
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:33,286
(Amanda sobs)

824
00:56:33,355 --> 00:56:34,736
Goodbye Amanda.

825
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:37,773
(melancholic music)

826
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:47,231
(door opens)

827
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:57,897
(melancholic music)

828
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:39,386
(glass clanks)

829
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:45,323

How are we feeling?

842
01:00:55,203 --> 01:00:57,101
About the same as
we probably look.

843
01:01:02,762 --> 01:01:06,007
How long have I've
been out of surgery?

844
01:01:07,525 --> 01:01:08,699
About 100 pages worth.

845
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,291
This doesn't
mean I forgive him.

846
01:01:17,501 --> 01:01:20,400
I just didn't want to be the
one to let him die you know?

847
01:01:25,578 --> 01:01:29,651
I couldn't live with that
guilt for the rest of my life.

848
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,617
(Claire) I know.

849
01:01:36,347 --> 01:01:38,108
You want me to
forgive and forget.

850
01:01:40,904 --> 01:01:42,526
I just can't, I can't.

851
01:01:52,053 --> 01:01:55,470
Oh, you won't forget
and that's okay.

852
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,718
And forgiveness, that'll
come with time and with God.

853
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:04,893
I'm sorry, a little sermon.

854
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:08,966
(instrumental music)

855
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:19,563
I can't have him my life.

856
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:25,017
I'll never be able to trust him.

857
01:02:27,433 --> 01:02:30,643
Amanda, Hank didn't make it.

858
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,199
He died on the operating table.

859
01:02:42,655 --> 01:02:44,761
It was his heart.

860
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,003
He went into cardiac arrest.

861
01:02:46,072 --> 01:02:48,109
The doctors couldn't save him.

862
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:56,289
I'm so sorry.

863
01:03:05,402 --> 01:03:07,024
I guess that's it.

864
01:03:10,752 --> 01:03:14,791
Like you said, we're all
gonna die someday right.

865
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,696
I couldn't let him die
and I couldn't save him.

866
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:26,768
What does that say about me?

867
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:28,977
(Claire) You did
the right thing.

868
01:03:34,949 --> 01:03:35,984
I'm really tired.

869
01:03:38,573 --> 01:03:40,368
Is it okay if I
check on you tomorrow?

870
01:03:50,033 --> 01:03:50,827
Claire,

871
01:03:56,177 --> 01:03:58,489
do you think he really
changed that much?

872
01:04:03,598 --> 01:04:04,426
Yes.

873
01:04:05,255 --> 01:04:06,083
Yes I do.

874
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,984
(ambient music)

875
01:05:23,126 --> 01:05:25,922
(car door closes)

876
01:05:39,383 --> 01:05:41,868
I don't have your rent, Bob.

877
01:05:43,284 --> 01:05:44,664
I haven't fixed your sink.

878
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:57,643
(instrumental music)

879
01:05:59,058 --> 01:06:01,819
What are you doing here?

880
01:06:01,888 --> 01:06:04,167
I just wanted
to give you this,

881
01:06:04,236 --> 01:06:05,962
it's money I took
from your fridge.

882
01:06:07,584 --> 01:06:09,586
What did you do,
did you rob the store?

883
01:06:09,655 --> 01:06:12,175
No, the band
booked a gig, a tour.

884
01:06:12,244 --> 01:06:13,141
Can you believe it?

885
01:06:14,315 --> 01:06:15,695
I know, right?

886
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:17,111
I mean, the tour,
the bus, the company,

887
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,975
they got a bus and everything.

888
01:06:19,044 --> 01:06:20,010
It's really great.

889
01:06:21,218 --> 01:06:22,564
I can go get your
guitar for you.

890
01:06:22,633 --> 01:06:25,740
Nah, I don't need it.

891
01:06:25,809 --> 01:06:26,983
Sell it.

892
01:06:27,052 --> 01:06:27,880
Go to Venice.

893
01:06:29,399 --> 01:06:31,056
All right, here's the thing.

894
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:32,298
Since I had no guitar,

895
01:06:32,367 --> 01:06:33,920
we'd been rehearsing
with me just singing.

896
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,338
It turns out, I sound
better when I don't play.

897
01:06:37,407 --> 01:06:38,546
Go figure.

898
01:06:38,615 --> 01:06:39,443
Go figure.

899
01:06:42,205 --> 01:06:43,413
Thank you.

900
01:06:43,482 --> 01:06:48,176
(Richie) Sure, I
better get going.

901
01:06:49,143 --> 01:06:50,006
We're leaving for Ohio tonight.

902
01:06:53,354 --> 01:06:54,562
Richie, I'm really sorry

903
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:56,460
for making it seem like
this is all your fault.

904
01:06:56,529 --> 01:07:00,568
It's not, I'm like
way too messed up

905
01:07:00,637 --> 01:07:02,846
to be in a relationship
right now, you know?

906
01:07:02,915 --> 01:07:03,709
(Richie) Yeah.

907
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:06,815
Still gonna miss you though.

908
01:07:06,884 --> 01:07:09,991
(instrumental music)

909
01:07:11,924 --> 01:07:12,752
Hey Richie.

910
01:07:13,684 --> 01:07:14,513
Yeah?

911
01:07:15,755 --> 01:07:17,033
Good luck on your tour.

912
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,044
