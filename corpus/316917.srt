1
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:28,828
Police! Get down! Everybody, down!

2
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:30,210
Down! Get down!

3
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:34,099
Go, go, go! Come on!

4
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:36,681
- Clear.
- Police. Get down.

5
00:01:36,907 --> 00:01:37,815
Seal it off.

6
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:39,907
Agent 10-10, we're all secure.

7
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,021
All right, we're out of here.

8
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:44,472
It's clear.

9
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:47,471
You smell that?

10
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,303
Couple hours. We gotta move now.
Would you turn that thing off?

11
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,505
All right, who's downstairs
we don't need?

12
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:20,493
It's all yours. Good luck.

13
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:26,575
I hate to do this, Jack, but I need you
to sit on this until uniforms get here.

14
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:28,327
- All right.
- Just hang until you're relieved.

15
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:29,636
All right.

16
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:31,994
Don't touch anything.

17
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,695
Any word on the suspects?

18
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,234
- What do you want me to tell you?
- What did you tell them?

19
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:03,500
I saw someone out there.

20
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,605
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

21
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:04,754
- Anything for me?
- Breath mints.

22
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,082
Sergeant Cannova called.
Wants you to write up this wire request.

23
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:11,573
Said to make sure
you get the right dates on them.

24
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:14,350
The particulars are on your desk,
and he needs it by tonight.

25
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:17,999
All right.

26
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:22,887
All right, well, we can have an officer
come by about 8 a. m. Tomorrow.

27
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:24,695
You gave her two?

28
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,306
Well, you know, we do what we can.

29
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:52,070
Hey, Jack, I forgot to tell you,
the lieutenant's looking for you.

30
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:53,728
He wants you to find him right away.

31
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:55,603
Yeah, yeah.

32
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:58,719
Well, listen.
All right, well, I'll call you.

33
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:04,071
Hey, Mosley.

34
00:05:05,823 --> 00:05:07,139
- Mosley.
- Yeah.

35
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,571
Grace tell you to find me?

36
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:13,072
- Yeah, just a minute ago.
- All right, need a favor.

37
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:15,463
Get this guy from lockup
and run him to Centre Street.

38
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:18,510
The DA needs him ASAP. He's gotta be
in front of a grand jury before 10.

39
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:21,714
I signed out.

40
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:24,046
You signed the sheet?

41
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:28,060
Well, not technically, no.
But I mean, I'm signed out.

42
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:29,595
Then consider yourself on overtime.

43
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:31,310
Captain Gruber called.
We need this thing done.

44
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,921
Don't you got some mutt
that takes care of this?

45
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,687
I got Keenan, but he's still on the verrazano.
He's behind some overturned truck.

46
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:45,734
I'm tired. I mean, look, normally,
you know me, I don't say no.

47
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:47,654
I know you been
working all night, Jack...

48
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,140
...but who's the detective
and who's the lieutenant here?

49
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,170
I mean, Jack, I got nobody else.

50
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:53,987
It's a nothing thing.

51
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:57,592
One hundred and eighteen minutes
to get a little hemorrhoid 16 blocks.

52
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,945
I'll let you come in
to work late tomorrow.

53
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:04,364
Yeah, yeah.

54
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:33,821
Edward Bunker.

55
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:36,769
Yeah, that's me, officer.
Eddie Bunker, right here.

56
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:38,176
Down here, the last cell.

57
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:40,680
- Come back in an hour.
- What do you mean, come back?

58
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:42,507
He's supposed to wear a suit
when he leaves.

59
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,587
- And?
- It's not here yet.

60
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:46,707
Just get him out here, all right?

61
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:49,161
They said he'd wear a suit.

62
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:53,556
No, yeah, I'm supposed to get a suit.
It's a three-piece suit. It's gray.

63
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:55,057
It's got... Wait. Yeah.

64
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:57,941
It's a three-button, it's gray,
it's got cuffs on the pants.

65
00:06:58,176 --> 00:07:00,793
They brought the catalog down.
I picked it out of the catalog.

66
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,951
I'm not supposed
to leave without it. Wait.

67
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,776
I'm not supposed to leave
without that suit.

68
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:08,665
- You tell it to him.
- No, that's why you brought my shoelaces.

69
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:11,114
- Come on, come on.
- I'm not supposed to.

70
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,665
- Yo, yo, you take the old lady, right?
- Yeah, you sure?

71
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:15,914
The old lady goes into the car,
otherwise she dies.

72
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:17,476
- You think so?
- Yeah, man.

73
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:20,183
That's what... I don't know. You gotta
figure out the answer for yourself.

74
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:24,544
Everybody just calm down.
Officer, I'm going to court.

75
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:26,782
- I'm supposed to have a suit.
- Hey.

76
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:28,748
Shut up. Here's your property.

77
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,171
- It's not a good sign.
- Hands behind your back.

78
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:33,750
- Hold on, I'm trying...
- Hands behind your back.

79
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:36,704
I don't even have my...
All my prop... Wait one minute.

80
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:40,578
It's not right.
They promised me the suit.

81
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:42,906
I picked it out of the catalog...
Wait, my book.

82
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:45,160
I can't leave without my book.
My book is very important to me.

83
00:07:46,703 --> 00:07:48,841
Why are we rushing like this?
It's not a good sign.

84
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:50,848
- Hey.
- What's the damn answer?

85
00:07:51,443 --> 00:07:53,362
- Hey!
- Shut up.

86
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,218
- I hate police.
- Half a tank.

87
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:03,546
You could have had
a little more patience.

88
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:07,144
This suit don't mean nothing to you.
You probably got a bunch of suits.

89
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,707
But it's a whole different thing to me.

90
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:23,319
These cars don't ever change, huh?

91
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,486
Traditional cruisers.

92
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,597
And the same retarded hump
in the middle.

93
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:33,743
Smell the same way,
like Lysol and vomit.

94
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:37,722
I hope nobody vomited back here.
They probably did.

95
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,567
Hey, man, let me ask you something.

96
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:50,660
I'm trying to figure this out.

97
00:08:51,993 --> 00:08:54,521
You driving along
in your hurricane, right?

98
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:56,348
There's three people at the bus stop.

99
00:08:57,322 --> 00:08:59,913
Yeah, one is an old lady.
She's sick, she about to die.

100
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:02,817
The second one is your best friend.

101
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:05,975
He saved your life, right?

102
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,773
And the third is the girl of your dreams.

103
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,652
Right, but check it out...

104
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:15,052
...you only got space in the car
for one person.

105
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:17,677
Right? Who you take?

106
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:22,164
It's a riddle that's supposed to tell
what type of person you are...

107
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:23,538
...like where you at in your life.

108
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:25,980
It's a hypothetical question, man, damn.

109
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:27,464
It's just a hypothetical...

110
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:32,057
Well, good. Fine, good.
I guess that's my answer.

111
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:42,886
Why don't you get
on the loudspeaker?

112
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,089
<i>Put the Hawaii Five-0 light on
or something.</i>

113
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:48,055
Use your police power.
Put on a little siren.

114
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,622
Make room, make a hole.

115
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,698
Isn't that the saying,
"Make a hole, make a hole"?

116
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,026
Go on, make a hole.

117
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:04,264
Signs. Everywhere, signs, signs, signs.
All over, man.

118
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,077
I used to not even see
nothing like that, man.

119
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:12,121
And then I start seeing them.
And I start looking for them.

120
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:14,592
And everything just start falling in place.

121
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:18,923
I'm gonna be all right,
where I'm supposed to be.

122
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:23,496
I ain't got my suit,
but once they get my testimony...

123
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:25,467
...they drop my charges, I'm free.

124
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:27,638
It's making sense to me.

125
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,469
I believe in that.

126
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:31,317
Being in the right place.

127
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:33,676
Being where you supposed to be.
You believe in that?

128
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:37,687
I believe life's too long
and guys like you make it even longer.

129
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:41,490
Life's too long?

130
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:44,529
Damn.

131
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:49,033
That's some cold shit, man. I ain't never
heard nobody say no shit like that.

132
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,859
Usually you hear about people
trying to make their life longer, you know?

133
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:56,222
Trying to stay alive a little longer.
You sound a little...

134
00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:58,953
...depressed or something, you all right?

135
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:04,476
You stopping?

136
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:07,340
This ain't the courthouse, man.
What you doing?

137
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:10,166
Yo.

138
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:12,807
Yo, why you stopping?

139
00:11:13,595 --> 00:11:16,280
You gonna rush me out to court,
and now you stopping? What are you...?

140
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:18,798
Hey. Hey, man.

141
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:22,519
Hey, man. Listen, man, I got an important
appointment after my court date, man.

142
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:26,623
That shit ain't funny, man.
Come on, man. It's not a game, man.

143
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:28,431
Yo.

144
00:11:29,437 --> 00:11:31,433
Some bullshit, man.

145
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:34,247
Hey. Hey!

146
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:38,325
No, man. It ain't Miller Time, man.

147
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:48,955
Sam. Hey, Angela.

148
00:11:57,204 --> 00:11:58,247
Add a pack of these, will you?

149
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,050
I know this dude smelled funny.
I got the wrong dude, man.

150
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:05,140
17.50. What?

151
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:07,645
Hey, don't open it. Come over here.

152
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:11,004
What time is it, man?

153
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:12,885
It's 8:11.

154
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:18,913
That's a good sign. That's a good sign.

155
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,543
I'm on my way. I'm gonna get there.

156
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:24,615
- Want change?
- No, you keep the change.

157
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:27,649
Keep the change.
All right, you have a good day.

158
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,406
- I don't want the peanuts.
- Bye.

159
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:32,810
No, man. Can't do nothing for you,
understand?

160
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,908
Hey, you better give me that change.
I'm gonna need that.

161
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:38,023
You see my situation right here?

162
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:40,618
No, no, no! No, no, no!

163
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:15,767
Hey!

164
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,803
How am I supposed to get out?

165
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:01,930
- Come on.
- Help me. Help me.

166
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,275
- My book. Why did you stop?
- Go, left, go. Left.

167
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:13,291
Move. Move. Move.

168
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,352
Wait. Freeze!

169
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:17,734
In here. Come on.

170
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,055
Shit.

171
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:26,555
Hey!

172
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:30,007
Just get out of here, now!
Go on. Go!

173
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,625
Come on, let's go.
That way, let's go. Go, go.

174
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:43,243
Ready? Here.

175
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:49,591
Let's go. Go.

176
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:54,385
- Dominic, get people out of here, right now.
- Jesus, Jackie. What's going on?

177
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,935
- Everybody. You too.
- All right, okay.

178
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,887
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on.

179
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:02,756
Hey, yo.

180
00:15:06,661 --> 00:15:08,740
Come on, keep going. Come on.
Come on, move it.

181
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:14,449
Yeah, this is Detective Jack Mosley,
shield number 227.

182
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,244
I am 10-13, at... Hold on a minute.

183
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,164
- Dominic, what's the address here?
- 133 Mulberry.

184
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:23,949
133 Mulberry.

185
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,005
Mulberry Street.

186
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,303
All right.

187
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:40,682
Is they coming?

188
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,120
I don't know why you stopped, man.

189
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:50,152
I don't know why
you would do that, man.

190
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,175
They said you were nobody.

191
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,940
- I ain't nobody.
- Shut up.

192
00:15:58,144 --> 00:16:01,045
You a wino. You need to stop drinking,
that's what you need.

193
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:03,584
Shut up.

194
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:15,655
Jack?

195
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:19,337
- Frank.
- Hey.

196
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,222
You all right?

197
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,165
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

198
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,306
We were on Mott when the call went out.
Heard it was you.

199
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:30,330
Got here as soon as we could.

200
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:35,909
Oh, hi.

201
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:38,125
- Hey.
- You all right?

202
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,844
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- You having fun?

203
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:44,115
- No.
- No? Oh, well.

204
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:46,040
Gotta have fun.

205
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:53,092
- What's up, Jack?
- Hey, man. Hi.

206
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:58,480
You did a really great, great job, man.

207
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:00,483
You got yourself a bad guy.

208
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:04,112
Been a while, huh? Yeah.

209
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:08,716
We got the second shooter
half a block from here, so it's done.

210
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:14,438
- Sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

211
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,328
I'm just getting my wind. I was running.

212
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:20,029
Why don't you let us take it from here.

213
00:17:20,545 --> 00:17:22,173
Oh, yeah.

214
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,549
We'll get the kid where he belongs,
and you don't have to worry about a thing.

215
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:29,188
- We'll get you home.
- Yes, please.

216
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:32,070
Please, please, officer.
That's a very good idea...

217
00:17:32,347 --> 00:17:34,459
...because, honestly, I don't think
this dude is doing too good.

218
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:36,162
I told him not to stop.

219
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:38,506
I asked him not to stop.
He just had to stop.

220
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:41,884
That's when everything happened.
Dude came to the window.

221
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:44,310
I have a very important
appointment aft...

222
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:45,820
Jack.

223
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:48,042
Hey, Shue.

224
00:17:57,054 --> 00:17:58,040
Come on. Here.

225
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,166
Why don't you take this. Come on.

226
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,289
We'll get you out of here.
Got a car waiting. All right?

227
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:03,945
Get some sleep.

228
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:08,587
Jack?

229
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:40,989
The kid was gonna testify against Jerry.

230
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:45,011
He saw Jerry doing some business.

231
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:50,952
Now, we both know that Jerry has never
been a standup guy like you and me.

232
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,537
He'll roll over, they indict him.
We can't have that.

233
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,593
No. It's gonna hurt a lot of us.

234
00:19:03,312 --> 00:19:04,327
Come on.

235
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:18,054
See, this whole thing caught us...
It caught us completely unaware.

236
00:19:21,664 --> 00:19:23,428
It was supposed to be
Teach's nephew driving him.

237
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:26,454
But he got stuck out there in traffic,
who knows where...

238
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:30,781
...so then your lieutenant, he pegged you.

239
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:35,829
You know, just the wrong time
and the wrong place for you today.

240
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:43,033
All right. Now, you know that I would never
put you in a position like this, right?

241
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:44,985
You know that, huh?

242
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:47,329
And I never figured
you'd cap one of those guys.

243
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,332
- That's what I get for hiring drug addicts.
- Grab the gun.

244
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:56,845
Grab the gun. There you go.

245
00:19:59,143 --> 00:20:00,289
Come on. Frank?

246
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:04,191
- Here we go.
- All right, here we go. Jack.

247
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,492
Squeeze the trigger.

248
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,146
All right. Let go of the gun.
Let go of the gun.

249
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,332
I figure it like this.

250
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:24,408
You... You pop the guys
trying to spring the kid.

251
00:20:24,878 --> 00:20:26,371
The kid, well, he gets your gun.

252
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,659
And he takes you hostage.

253
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:32,937
So we came in and saved the day.

254
00:20:33,813 --> 00:20:35,919
He died, you lived.

255
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:39,092
Now, this could be a good thing
for you, Jack.

256
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:43,583
Get you back where you belong.

257
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:54,894
- Are you still with?
- Stand up.

258
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:57,533
- You still with what's-her-name?
- Come on, stand up.

259
00:20:58,307 --> 00:20:59,444
- What are you waiting for?
- What's her name?

260
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,544
Caroline.

261
00:21:19,353 --> 00:21:20,252
It's Caroline.

262
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:24,330
This changes everything, Jack.

263
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:29,203
Over here.

264
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:35,231
Come on, Frank.

265
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:43,079
Kid, get up. Come on.

266
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,434
Shit. Man, shit.

267
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:59,188
All right, Jack, it's 8:25.

268
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,362
- You stay there.
- Listen to me, the jury's tenure ends at 10.

269
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,315
All right? The kid gets there
one minute past, all this...

270
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,018
...it doesn't matter.

271
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,364
And all you gotta do
is look the other way.

272
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,001
All right? We still got options here.

273
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,676
Okay?

274
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:21,375
We just want the kid.

275
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:26,000
Jack, Jack, Jack,
just let me help you.

276
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:28,240
All right?

277
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,630
Back up.

278
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:34,803
Jack, once you go out that door...

279
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:37,754
...I can't help you.

280
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,407
Please just back up, Frank.
Just back up.

281
00:23:00,736 --> 00:23:01,613
He shot a cop.

282
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,459
What the hell did you see?
What did you see?

283
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:06,402
That cop back there.

284
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,144
I seen him around my way...

285
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:11,503
...holding a gun in this
little Puerto Rican kid's mouth.

286
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,230
Come on. Let's go.

287
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,518
He said he'd kill his mother
if he testified.

288
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,098
What you doing that for?
We need that.

289
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:22,493
The shell in that gun was over 20 years old.
Lucky it went off at all.

290
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:25,381
- They didn't tell you Shue was a cop?
- No, they didn't tell me.

291
00:23:26,117 --> 00:23:27,661
They showed me a picture, that was it.

292
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:31,849
Well, congratulations, because you're about
to testify against one of New York's worst.

293
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,903
- What?
- Fellas, look, the clock's ticking.

294
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:36,401
He's gotta be at the courthouse by 10.
We know where he's going.

295
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,618
Mulvey, you're coming with me.

296
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,008
- Know where you're going?
- Take the north side.

297
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:43,530
- You got it, let's go.
- Come on.

298
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:46,966
- Captain.
- Where are we, Frank?

299
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:50,292
Well, we're putting descriptions out
over precinct channels.

300
00:23:51,044 --> 00:23:54,368
No names, or that one's a cop.
It'll help to have some eyes.

301
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,266
- How long can you sit on this?
- He shot a cop.

302
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,746
You're the precinct captain, Dan.
How long?

303
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:04,915
I don't know.
Hour, maybe a little more.

304
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:07,375
- Who's on this with you?
- My guys.

305
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:11,543
Ortiz and Maldonado from the 66.
Touhey and Kaller from the 111.

306
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:13,370
A couple others
you don't wanna know about.

307
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:19,186
The guy was your partner for 20 years.

308
00:24:20,077 --> 00:24:21,189
What the hell happened in there?

309
00:24:22,402 --> 00:24:23,531
- Is he drunk?
- I don't know.

310
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:26,061
I don't know. We woke him up.

311
00:24:27,893 --> 00:24:30,621
Hopefully he'll do what he always does,
and we can go back to work.

312
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,972
If he doesn't?

313
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:38,209
We gotta quash this thing
before he gets his legs back.

314
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:41,423
These are his streets.

315
00:24:44,796 --> 00:24:47,937
This could get ugly for all of us
if that kid talks.

316
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:50,768
- He can't talk.
- He won't talk.

317
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,218
Look, I appreciate
what you did for me back there...

318
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:56,192
...but I'm starting to think
you're not the dude for this.

319
00:24:57,016 --> 00:24:59,080
I mean, you're out of breath,
you're hung-over.

320
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,692
Your leg is gonna give out on you
any second, man.

321
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:04,877
I got someplace I need to be at 12,
you understand?

322
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:07,515
I need to be finished at court by 10...

323
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:09,325
...or I'm not gonna get
where I'm supposed to get.

324
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:12,377
- You understand what I'm saying?
- All right, I understand.

325
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:15,228
- You're not listening to what I'm saying.
- Wait, come here. Come here.

326
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:15,399
Come on.

327
00:25:23,465 --> 00:25:24,276
Hung-over.

328
00:25:25,418 --> 00:25:26,173
A bad leg.

329
00:25:27,196 --> 00:25:28,047
No gun.

330
00:25:32,287 --> 00:25:33,664
- Bobby?
- Yeah?

331
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:36,270
<i>- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- I'm already there.</i>

332
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:01,809
Oh, God.

333
00:26:06,616 --> 00:26:07,431
Come on, let's go.

334
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,481
Listen, just stay put right here.
I'll be right back.

335
00:26:15,682 --> 00:26:17,483
Come on, man, don't take long.
We gotta go.

336
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:21,033
Hurry up.

337
00:26:22,718 --> 00:26:25,196
- Hey, man, where your bathroom?
- What?

338
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,188
Your bathroom. Where your bathroom at?

339
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:28,894
Down at the end of the hall.

340
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:30,854
Yeah.

341
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:35,315
That's what you look like
when you smile, huh?

342
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:39,169
You was probably drinking then too.

343
00:26:43,204 --> 00:26:43,969
There's the lady.

344
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:47,749
Redhead. She cute. That ain't bad.

345
00:26:48,888 --> 00:26:52,104
Hey, man. Come on, don't be stopping
to get high or nothing like that.

346
00:26:52,355 --> 00:26:53,325
Man, we gotta go.

347
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:57,779
Make sure you lift the seat up
before you go.

348
00:27:02,216 --> 00:27:03,250
It's up already.

349
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,596
Maybe you left it like that, huh?

350
00:27:47,924 --> 00:27:48,694
I'm coming.

351
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:05,138
Hey, Jack.

352
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:08,134
Jack Mosley.

353
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:13,012
Why did you do that?

354
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:15,494
Do what?

355
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:17,715
Shoot that cop.

356
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:21,105
Cops...

357
00:28:22,153 --> 00:28:23,281
...they don't shoot other cops.

358
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:27,530
Especially over nobody like me.

359
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:41,824
It's a long way to go for a stranger,
you know.

360
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:44,968
Thank you.

361
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:47,766
I never had nobody...

362
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:49,978
Hell, man, you know.

363
00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:52,954
I don't rock with the police,
you know what I'm saying?

364
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:56,150
- Finger off the trigger.
- They never been my friend.

365
00:28:56,962 --> 00:28:58,964
- Then here you come.
- On the ground.

366
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:00,494
It's kind of bugging me out, you know.

367
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:04,779
You on some vigilante business.

368
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:05,729
Let's go.

369
00:29:07,118 --> 00:29:09,200
- Jack...
- Put your arms around the pole.

370
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,172
I don't know what to think anymore.

371
00:29:11,813 --> 00:29:13,654
- Here. Cuff yourself.
- What are you doing, Jack?

372
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:17,267
Yeah, it's a little strange.

373
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:20,245
You know? By any definition, this here.

374
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:21,672
All right, kid. Good.

375
00:29:22,312 --> 00:29:22,995
Okay.

376
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:26,296
Okay, okay, okay.

377
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,739
Okay.

378
00:29:30,628 --> 00:29:31,374
Okay.

379
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:34,356
You should have done
what you always do, Jack.

380
00:29:36,904 --> 00:29:39,017
- Where's your phone?
- It's on the left-hand side.

381
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,606
They know I'm here.
If I don't answer it...

382
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:48,644
- Jack?
- Let's go, kid. Come on.

383
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:05,021
<i>- Bob.
- Bob's a little tied up right now, Frank.</i>

384
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:07,733
<i>All right, I'm impressed, Jack.</i>

385
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:09,375
Did you shoot him too?

386
00:30:11,657 --> 00:30:12,773
Send someone to check on Bobby.

387
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:20,067
<i>Jack, you're not up to this.</i>

388
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:22,664
<i>All right? It's gonna end bad for you.</i>

389
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:27,375
You lost the kid, didn't you?

390
00:30:30,382 --> 00:30:32,146
<i>He bailed on you. Well, you know what?</i>

391
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,221
<i>That is the best thing
that could have happened.</i>

392
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,692
<i>So why don't you go home.</i>

393
00:30:35,996 --> 00:30:36,988
Forget about what happened.

394
00:30:37,323 --> 00:30:39,378
We'll take it from here.
Are you looking for him?

395
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:41,114
<i>And you can't find him.</i>

396
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:43,825
<i>We're gonna find him, all right?</i>

397
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,665
<i>We're gonna find him.</i>

398
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,569
All right, Jack, now you can hang up.

399
00:30:52,007 --> 00:30:52,853
Where are you, kid?

400
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,356
All right. Now, let's see
which way he went.

401
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,637
Did he go up? Did he go down?

402
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:01,539
In or out, Jackie.
Which way did he go?

403
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:05,069
Let's see if he went down.

404
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:10,167
- Excuse me, Sir, do you mind swiping?
- Get a job, man.

405
00:31:10,683 --> 00:31:11,634
Ma'am, would you mind swiping me in?

406
00:31:12,477 --> 00:31:15,209
Ma'am? Ma'am, would you mind
swiping me in, please, Ma'am?

407
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,521
I have a very important
appointment I have to...

408
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:23,602
Excuse me, Ma'am, would you mind...?
Somebody mind swiping me in?

409
00:31:24,047 --> 00:31:25,600
I'm trying to get
to an important appointment.

410
00:31:27,578 --> 00:31:29,232
Somebody help me. Somebody help me.

411
00:31:30,358 --> 00:31:31,404
Somebody help me.

412
00:31:32,672 --> 00:31:33,611
Hey.

413
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:36,872
Come here.

414
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,279
- Come on. Go.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

415
00:31:55,422 --> 00:31:56,306
Eddie!

416
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,135
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

417
00:31:58,548 --> 00:32:00,103
- Why are you running?
- What do you want?

418
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,828
It's too much, man.
I'm doing the rest on my own.

419
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,121
I'm doing what I said.
I'm getting out of here.

420
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:08,005
- If I can find you, they can find you!
- I'm doing what I said.

421
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,529
Eddie, listen to me. Listen to me.
Listen to me!

422
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,887
- I'm your only friend down here.
- No, you're not my friend.

423
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:16,970
- I can do this...
- Friend? You don't even know me!

424
00:32:17,788 --> 00:32:19,886
And get me where?
You gonna get me shot.

425
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:23,326
Ever since I've been with you, people been
trying to shoot me. People you know!

426
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:27,122
Look, man, I got someplace I need to be.
I got something I need to do.

427
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:29,625
Unless you gonna shoot me or arrest me,
I'm going, Jack.

428
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:32,609
- I can't let you leave.
- Thank you, Jack Mosley. I'm going.

429
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,365
- You can't leave.
- Yes, I can. Thank you, Jack Mosley.

430
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,208
Stop. Don't do that. Stop.

431
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:39,685
Ladies and gentlemen...!
You're not going. Come here.

432
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:40,958
Eddie!

433
00:32:43,382 --> 00:32:45,172
Okay, okay.
Okay, we gotta go.

434
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,689
- Move! Move!
- Get out of the way!

435
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,798
Move! Move!

436
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:02,423
- Here, come on.
- What are you doing?

437
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:04,364
Taxi! Hey!

438
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,108
Taxi!

439
00:33:10,896 --> 00:33:13,351
It's Kaller. He just missed them
at the Canal Street station.

440
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:14,958
Where, where, where?

441
00:33:16,063 --> 00:33:17,739
Shit. Where the hell is he?

442
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:20,458
Goddamn it.

443
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:22,267
We're gonna find you.

444
00:33:23,646 --> 00:33:26,137
Yeah, this is Detective Nugent.
I need a triangulation...

445
00:33:26,382 --> 00:33:30,154
<i>...on Detective Torres' cell phone.
Area code 917935</i>

446
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:37,867
That cop back at the apartment,
he said you should do what you always do.

447
00:33:38,177 --> 00:33:39,586
What did he...?
What did he mean by that?

448
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:44,293
You're not doing
what you always do, huh?

449
00:33:45,966 --> 00:33:48,013
Jack Mosley, I get it. I see the signs.

450
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:51,949
I'm where I'm supposed to be.
I was wrong. You're the right guy.

451
00:33:52,225 --> 00:33:54,591
I could have got another guy,
did something different, but I got you.

452
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,431
I appreciate it. You're the right guy.

453
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:58,227
- Okay?
- Okay.

454
00:33:58,553 --> 00:34:00,139
<i>- This is Comtech, over.
- Yeah, go, this is Nugent.</i>

455
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:02,668
GPS indicates they're on Bowery.

456
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:05,525
<i>Repeat, Bowery,
moving south towards Pell.</i>

457
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:07,119
<i>Speed indicates they're on foot.</i>

458
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:09,179
Are you hearing this, boys?
He's in Chinatown.

459
00:34:10,094 --> 00:34:10,853
<i>Let's move in.</i>

460
00:34:20,298 --> 00:34:22,201
- What's the deal with that book?
- It's my business plans.

461
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,355
I'm moving to Seattle.
My sister's already living out there.

462
00:34:25,558 --> 00:34:28,576
I'm gonna open up a bakery.
But it's only, like, a specialty bakery.

463
00:34:29,106 --> 00:34:31,295
Birthday cakes for little kids.
There's a lot of money in that.

464
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,864
I'm gonna send you
a big birthday cake on your birthday...

465
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:36,968
- I hate birthday cakes.
- You hate birthday cakes?

466
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:38,951
First thing that doesn't go your way...

467
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:41,173
...you're gonna be slipping into
Carol's Clip and Curl...

468
00:34:41,484 --> 00:34:43,018
...and stealing all her hair-care products.

469
00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:45,846
Because you're a thief.
And that's what you are, Eddie.

470
00:34:46,076 --> 00:34:48,882
- You're always gonna be a thief.
- People can change, Jack.

471
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:52,298
- Days change, seasons change. Not people.
- Yes, you do...

472
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:55,423
- People don't change, Eddie.
- Yes, you do. I'll get you that cake.

473
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:57,093
You know what it's gonna say on top?

474
00:34:57,905 --> 00:35:01,437
"Jack Mosley, ha-ha-ha, eat this. " Make you
eat your words, lick your fingers too.

475
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:03,225
Subject's moving west on Pell.

476
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:09,501
Subject now moving south on Doyers.
Still moving south on Doyers.

477
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:13,492
Bobby, you take Doyer, we got Pell.
And, Kaller, you close up Bowery.

478
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:15,007
<i>- Copy that.
- Let's squeeze him.</i>

479
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,049
<i>- Copy that, on my way.
- Why don't you pull up. Pull up.</i>

480
00:35:59,276 --> 00:36:01,269
- Sorry.
- Who is that? You can't go in here.

481
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:02,507
Oh, sorry.

482
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,996
Look, man, I gotta be down there.
All right, you understand?

483
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:29,158
I gotta be down there that way, and
there's streets and shit in between there.

484
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:32,438
You got some sort of plan?
Some sort of police plan or something?

485
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,122
I see your limp acting up.
You ought to get that checked out.

486
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:39,526
I have a buddy of mine
walking around with a limp just like that.

487
00:36:39,826 --> 00:36:40,961
He don't wanna go
to the doctor, alright?

488
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:45,038
Finally he go,
they say it's a fracture, right?

489
00:36:45,726 --> 00:36:48,293
And now it's infected.
They gotta cut it off at the knee.

490
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:51,133
Wasn't so bad, though.
He had no more pain.

491
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:53,998
He ended up moving to Jersey,
working for the PATH...

492
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:56,587
...being a motorman.
Got a pension and shit now.

493
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:59,025
I guess everything happens for a reason,
you know what I mean?

494
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:01,853
You're a sunny little shit,
I'll give you that much.

495
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,886
Get in here! Get in that door!

496
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:11,808
Jack!

497
00:37:13,423 --> 00:37:17,034
- Pull me in! Help me in!
- Come on, come on, come on.

498
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:18,991
Lock the door.

499
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:26,524
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Hold up.

500
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:28,048
Come on.

501
00:37:58,981 --> 00:38:00,184
- You all right?
- Yeah.

502
00:38:17,203 --> 00:38:18,536
Jack, what are we doing?
Where are we going?

503
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:26,237
- Come on.
- Where we going, Jack?

504
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:27,736
Out of the way.

505
00:38:28,326 --> 00:38:28,986
Over here.

506
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:35,484
Jack? How we even know that Centre Street
Courthouse is in this direction, Jack?

507
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:37,016
Jack? We gotta know...

508
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:40,033
Down! Head down!

509
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:42,469
Go!

510
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:46,374
Come on!

511
00:39:00,894 --> 00:39:01,627
Kaller!

512
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:04,081
Push it.

513
00:39:35,204 --> 00:39:35,929
You all right, Jack?

514
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:43,282
I was aiming for the kid,
if that makes you feel better.

515
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,815
Well, you missed!

516
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:51,298
That kid is gonna get you killed.

517
00:39:53,864 --> 00:39:54,693
He worth that?

518
00:40:01,815 --> 00:40:02,663
Well, I got all day.

519
00:40:05,096 --> 00:40:06,039
How about you, you got all day?

520
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,135
- Jack, you still there?
- Yeah.

521
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:14,396
Still here.

522
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,543
Well, this is awkward.

523
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:25,115
When I started this day...

524
00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:29,293
...I never figured on trading
9 mils with my friend.

525
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:35,103
I think we stopped being friends
right around 8:25, in that bar.

526
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:38,057
No.

527
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,039
No, that's not gonna erase
20 years together.

528
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:46,006
We're still friends.

529
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:51,248
Look...

530
00:40:52,572 --> 00:40:53,951
...a lot I'd take back, but I can't.

531
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:59,541
Well, so you move forward.
Next day, next case.

532
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:02,983
- Lines were crossed.
- What lines?

533
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:06,888
- You hear me? Lines were crossed, Frank.
- What lines? There are no lines!

534
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:10,947
There's getting it done
and not getting it done, period!

535
00:41:11,785 --> 00:41:14,283
You put the bad guys away
no matter what it takes.

536
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:16,673
Now, you're gonna ruin the lives...

537
00:41:18,315 --> 00:41:19,766
...of six cops.

538
00:41:21,306 --> 00:41:22,387
Good cops.

539
00:41:23,138 --> 00:41:23,892
Good men.

540
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:31,548
Are you ready to sacrifice
their lives for that kid?

541
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,449
Hey, Frank.

542
00:41:35,757 --> 00:41:36,968
- Frank.
- Yeah?

543
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,904
This is not about me
ruining anybody's life.

544
00:41:41,155 --> 00:41:42,594
Okay? This is about you.

545
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,235
You hear me?

546
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:47,965
Yeah.

547
00:41:49,765 --> 00:41:50,813
You look at that kid's jacket?

548
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,824
I did.

549
00:41:54,565 --> 00:41:57,576
- Armed robbery, assault, beats old women...
- I never had no armed robbery!

550
00:41:57,946 --> 00:42:00,664
Beats old women over the heads,
steals their Social Security checks.

551
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:04,230
- One time, I used...
- Shut up. Shut up.

552
00:42:04,546 --> 00:42:06,029
Oh, no, don't tell him to shut up.

553
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:09,903
No, Jack, listen to him.
No, that kid, he's sharp.

554
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:12,104
Yeah, he's playing you.

555
00:42:14,578 --> 00:42:15,871
He's sharper than you are.

556
00:42:17,364 --> 00:42:18,550
He's telling you stories, right?

557
00:42:20,029 --> 00:42:21,344
He wants to be a good citizen.

558
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:24,609
Go to church.

559
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:26,435
Buy his mother a house.

560
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:30,380
But he has spent
more than half his life in prison.

561
00:42:32,935 --> 00:42:37,013
Two hours ago, he was sitting in a cell
for weapons possession.

562
00:42:38,326 --> 00:42:40,535
- He's always gonna do what he has done.
- I wasn't...

563
00:42:40,902 --> 00:42:43,604
He is a career criminal.
That's who you're protecting.

564
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:48,230
- You all right?
- Yeah. Frank's got him on the other side.

565
00:42:50,058 --> 00:42:51,143
He's got my gun too.

566
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:53,221
Now, if you can't see
how wrong this is...

567
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:56,183
...I promise you
I will speak from my heart...

568
00:42:57,885 --> 00:42:59,435
...when I give the eulogy at your funeral.

569
00:43:01,184 --> 00:43:02,113
So...

570
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,126
...do you believe the kid?

571
00:43:08,424 --> 00:43:09,784
Or do you believe your ex-partner?

572
00:43:15,612 --> 00:43:17,616
Frank, we're right
on the other side of the door.

573
00:43:18,158 --> 00:43:19,280
Because...

574
00:43:21,105 --> 00:43:22,357
...if you believe the kid...

575
00:43:25,629 --> 00:43:26,778
...you got a choice to make.

576
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:36,470
Do you go through your ex-partner?

577
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,848
Or do you choose door number two...

578
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:45,470
...and go back to where you came,
with your gimpy leg and your shot-up hand?

579
00:43:54,816 --> 00:43:57,750
You're not gonna get very far.
And what if your ex-partner is right, Jack?

580
00:43:59,422 --> 00:44:02,674
What if he is right, and you're wasting
your whole miserable life?

581
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:22,929
- It's Frank.
- You all right?

582
00:44:23,307 --> 00:44:25,150
Yeah. They're in the elevator.
Seal the building.

583
00:44:26,788 --> 00:44:28,231
Come on, Bobby.
Come on, get on that.

584
00:44:29,238 --> 00:44:30,518
Everybody out! Police!

585
00:44:31,653 --> 00:44:35,241
Everybody out! Police!
Move, move! Police!

586
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:38,282
- Frank, where are you?
- Bobby, I'm coming up!

587
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:43,547
All right. Come on, come on.
Upstairs. Seal the stairwell.

588
00:44:44,024 --> 00:44:45,928
- All right.
- Find the back stairs. Check the roof.

589
00:44:46,188 --> 00:44:47,844
- Come on, Mal! This way.
- Got you.

590
00:44:48,047 --> 00:44:49,769
- Maldonado, seal it up.
- Got you.

591
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:08,287
Hello? Hello? Hello?

592
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:14,378
- No, nothing.
- No answer. He's not there. Come on.

593
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:24,848
I never open door.

594
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,940
Please. Please, help.

595
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:32,292
Come on.

596
00:45:36,505 --> 00:45:37,972
Jack, Jack, Jack. Thank you.

597
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:43,177
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

598
00:45:43,481 --> 00:45:46,199
- You saw that, right? You heard him, right?
- Yeah. He never opens the door.

599
00:45:56,411 --> 00:45:58,283
Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

600
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:02,396
- Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you.

601
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:04,578
- You heard him, right, Jack?
- Not now, Eddie.

602
00:46:05,522 --> 00:46:07,654
- Keep your voice down.
- He said he never opens the door.

603
00:46:08,649 --> 00:46:10,098
You know what that mean, right?

604
00:46:13,725 --> 00:46:15,155
Not right now.
There's the signs everywhere.

605
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:19,393
<i>- Yeah, ADA MacDonald, please.
- May I tell her who's calling?</i>

606
00:46:19,663 --> 00:46:21,424
Yeah, tell her it's the guy
that's got her witness.

607
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:31,142
You're driving a car
during a hurricane.

608
00:46:31,775 --> 00:46:32,531
Like:

609
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,708
A hurricane.

610
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:38,080
And there's three people at a bus stop.

611
00:46:39,035 --> 00:46:40,755
- A old woman.
- Yeah.

612
00:46:41,524 --> 00:46:43,979
A friend, like my friend here.

613
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:46,947
Him. He save your life, your friend.

614
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,285
It's Detective Mosley for you.

615
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:51,805
- Mosley?
- Yeah?

616
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:53,456
Where are you?
Where's my witness?

617
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,067
I'm about seven blocks from you.

618
00:46:55,942 --> 00:46:57,665
But there's about a ton of cops
between me and you.

619
00:46:58,211 --> 00:46:59,279
And they all want this kid dead.

620
00:47:00,033 --> 00:47:02,002
Not to mention that
you got a leak in your office.

621
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:05,145
- Somebody's talking to these cops.
- Shit.

622
00:47:05,678 --> 00:47:07,524
What did you think was gonna happen
when you pinched Shue?

623
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,554
You thought they'd just lay down
and go away quietly?

624
00:47:11,274 --> 00:47:13,208
We thought if we went to the grand jury,
Shue would fold.

625
00:47:13,669 --> 00:47:14,661
He bent but didn't break.

626
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:17,866
<i>We were gonna throw it away until
we ran into Edward Bunker last night.</i>

627
00:47:18,912 --> 00:47:22,717
Jury's tenure ends at 10. Without that kid,
they'll vote no bill and it all goes away.

628
00:47:23,244 --> 00:47:24,776
<i>He's an eyewitness.
He makes this work.</i>

629
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,540
Where are you? I'll send my squad.
Richard, pen.

630
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,071
What room?

631
00:47:51,877 --> 00:47:55,619
- So, what, are they coming?
- Yeah, they're coming.

632
00:47:56,373 --> 00:48:00,658
Good. Because I gotta be somewhere, man.
I got something to do.

633
00:48:01,447 --> 00:48:04,572
I gotta be someplace by noon.
I gotta go get something.

634
00:48:04,936 --> 00:48:05,860
It's real important.

635
00:48:06,935 --> 00:48:08,352
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

636
00:48:09,275 --> 00:48:10,295
Ortiz, I'm coming in the building.

637
00:48:13,112 --> 00:48:13,934
Frank?

638
00:48:17,423 --> 00:48:20,248
- Touhey and Kaller are taken care of.
- Good. Find Bobby. He's on the back stairs.

639
00:48:21,425 --> 00:48:24,248
Eddie, come here, put this on.
Here, come on, put that on.

640
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:27,561
But it's a big, hot, wool shirt.
It's hot. It's summer.

641
00:48:28,089 --> 00:48:30,142
- You're dressed like a criminal.
- Oh, you want me to...?

642
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:33,095
You want me to change my...?
I get it. But why can't I put that on?

643
00:48:33,923 --> 00:48:35,098
- What about this?
- What about that?

644
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,014
- What's wrong with this? It's just a pattern.
- He don't even wear that.

645
00:48:38,636 --> 00:48:39,687
Just put the... Here.

646
00:48:40,347 --> 00:48:41,629
Never mind. What about this?

647
00:48:42,098 --> 00:48:45,437
Is this all right? Mass-transit blue?

648
00:48:50,092 --> 00:48:51,954
When I was locked up,
they had me work in the kitchen.

649
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:55,919
So one day a little dude
walk up to me and say:

650
00:48:56,165 --> 00:48:57,420
"Hey, you think
you could bake me a cake?"

651
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,766
I said, "Yeah, I'll bake you a cake. "

652
00:48:59,281 --> 00:49:01,202
I ain't tell him I ain't never
baked a cake, you know.

653
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:03,360
But I ain't got shit else to do.

654
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:06,268
So, you know, I read the instructions...

655
00:49:07,473 --> 00:49:10,391
...I bake him a cake, you know,
for his daughter's birthday.

656
00:49:10,703 --> 00:49:11,883
She'd come up there to visit him.

657
00:49:12,671 --> 00:49:15,783
You know, it say,
"Happy Birthday, Angel," right?

658
00:49:16,943 --> 00:49:19,427
He go crazy.
He can't get enough, you know.

659
00:49:19,704 --> 00:49:22,068
He said, "Eddie, you done hooked me up.
Man, you the man. "

660
00:49:23,066 --> 00:49:25,379
And I started doing that.
It was good. I had a skill.

661
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:27,690
People look at me different.
They would start...

662
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:29,612
- You missed a button.
- Did I?

663
00:49:30,253 --> 00:49:31,142
Your buttons are all crooked.

664
00:49:32,491 --> 00:49:34,111
- Come on. Come on, man.
- All right.

665
00:49:35,455 --> 00:49:36,277
Nugent.

666
00:49:39,808 --> 00:49:40,652
You're a prince.

667
00:49:44,128 --> 00:49:46,834
<i>- The word is 5E, boys, 5E.
- Got it.</i>

668
00:49:50,009 --> 00:49:52,365
Then I start doing my research,
doing my due diligence.

669
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:55,896
I found out, you know, it's good money
in birthday cakes for kids, you know.

670
00:49:56,872 --> 00:50:00,867
That type of thing, like Tweety Bird
or Bugs Bunny or something like that.

671
00:50:02,177 --> 00:50:03,760
<i>Or Yu-Gi-Oh!.
You ever heard of Yu-Gi-Oh!?</i>

672
00:50:05,114 --> 00:50:08,091
<i>- Yu-Gi-Oh!.
- Yu-Gi-Oh!. Kids love that, man.</i>

673
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,929
<i>You don't know Yu-Gi-Oh!?
You gotta get out more. Yu-Gi-Oh! hot.</i>

674
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:17,545
Know what I'm saying?

675
00:50:22,385 --> 00:50:25,336
I'm gonna make money, Jack.
Open up my bakery.

676
00:50:26,307 --> 00:50:29,732
You gonna eat your words about me, Jack.
How do I look? Do I look all right?

677
00:50:30,704 --> 00:50:32,447
- All right.
- Freeze! Police!

678
00:50:32,874 --> 00:50:34,244
- Police! Police!
- Shut up!

679
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:35,794
- Oh, my God!
- Shut up!

680
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:40,261
Frank, they gave us
the wrong apartment.

681
00:50:45,048 --> 00:50:45,781
Put it down.

682
00:50:47,495 --> 00:50:48,495
Put it down.

683
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:55,410
Can't get lucky all the time.

684
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:57,753
You can be smart every day, though.

685
00:51:00,806 --> 00:51:03,181
- All right, give me the gun.
- Hold on.

686
00:51:03,825 --> 00:51:04,823
What are you doing?

687
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,545
This place is crawling with cops, Eddie.

688
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:14,982
Hey, look at me.

689
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:19,032
Eddie, what are you doing?

690
00:51:20,496 --> 00:51:21,407
How does it feel?

691
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:26,815
How does it feel?

692
00:51:28,105 --> 00:51:29,059
You're a baker, right?

693
00:51:30,918 --> 00:51:32,734
Eddie, listen to him.

694
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:35,711
Pull that trigger,
you go to jail for life.

695
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,286
<i>Frank, we're on our way down.</i>

696
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:40,287
<i>Frank, do you read me?</i>

697
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:46,882
- You can't stop me, you understand?
- Time to go.

698
00:51:47,552 --> 00:51:49,222
- Time to go.
- You can't stop me.

699
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:53,538
You gave him a loaded weapon?

700
00:51:58,877 --> 00:52:00,437
- Frank.
- Bobby, get these things off me.

701
00:52:00,843 --> 00:52:02,860
- Did he take your gun?
- They went south. Get out of here.

702
00:52:03,112 --> 00:52:06,179
Ortiz! Ortiz, give me a piece.
Give me a piece! Get over here.

703
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:13,704
Make a hole, make a hole.
Come on, make a hole.

704
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,831
Speak to me.
Come on, somebody, speak to me.

705
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,272
Turn.

706
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:42,991
- Excuse me!
- Open up!

707
00:52:43,506 --> 00:52:44,603
- Excuse me!
- Open up!

708
00:52:47,174 --> 00:52:49,141
Keep moving. Go.
Go, go, go.

709
00:52:51,734 --> 00:52:52,562
Oh, shit.

710
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:56,846
On the bus! Let's go.

711
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,490
- Just keep driving.
- What are you doing?

712
00:53:04,912 --> 00:53:06,831
- I'm a cop. Lock the back door.
- He's got a gun!

713
00:53:09,657 --> 00:53:12,175
No stops.
Tell them to hang on to something, Eddie!

714
00:53:12,863 --> 00:53:15,846
Hang on! Don't worry, this man,
he's a police officer.

715
00:53:16,298 --> 00:53:17,851
- Everything is gonna be fine.
- Hang on!

716
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,005
Everybody just hang on. Don't worry!

717
00:53:29,096 --> 00:53:30,505
Right, right, right! Go right!

718
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:37,163
- What are you doing?
- Stop this thing!

719
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:50,601
Get down!

720
00:54:16,491 --> 00:54:17,976
Get away from the bus!
Away from the bus!

721
00:54:21,804 --> 00:54:23,186
Stay down! Stay down!

722
00:54:29,618 --> 00:54:30,321
Heads down!

723
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:36,323
- Where the hell are you?
- Construction site at Baxter.

724
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:37,512
He has hostages.

725
00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:42,600
Let me go.

726
00:54:50,693 --> 00:54:51,433
Listen!

727
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:54,878
Everybody, stand up.
They're not gonna shoot you.

728
00:54:55,615 --> 00:54:56,954
Stand up in front of the windows.

729
00:54:57,869 --> 00:54:59,830
They won't shoot you.
You, stay down. Stay down.

730
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,675
Fill in the blanks. Fill in the spots.

731
00:55:07,529 --> 00:55:09,225
Scoot over, scoot over! That's it.

732
00:55:10,003 --> 00:55:11,525
- All right, get Gruber down here.
- Okay.

733
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:19,036
Hey!

734
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:21,747
All right, seal off that end.

735
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:37,711
- It's a busload.
- Jesus, this shit just gets deeper.

736
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,103
- Bobby?
- Gruber's on his way.

737
00:55:40,197 --> 00:55:42,147
All right. We gotta get
our stories straight, all right?

738
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:43,954
We're getting our stories straight?

739
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:51,198
Yeah, suit up.

740
00:56:03,229 --> 00:56:05,321
Thought we could handle this quickly
and quietly, Commissioner.

741
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:08,057
A guy shoots a cop,
takes a grand-jury witness hostage...

742
00:56:08,263 --> 00:56:09,510
...and we're supposed to make nice?

743
00:56:10,143 --> 00:56:13,651
Commissioner, look, Sir, this is...
Watch your back, Sir.

744
00:56:14,516 --> 00:56:15,737
This is my fault, all right?

745
00:56:16,246 --> 00:56:19,121
I used to work with Mosley,
so I asked the captain to let me handle it.

746
00:56:19,687 --> 00:56:22,690
I felt that I could bring him in.
I just didn't realize how far gone he was.

747
00:56:22,968 --> 00:56:25,248
- Stay on Tac 2, boys.
- Wait for command, here we go.

748
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:29,206
That's it, cover them up.

749
00:56:32,052 --> 00:56:35,193
Good, okay. Great job. Thank you.

750
00:56:42,515 --> 00:56:44,016
- Commissioner, Sir. Captain.
- Hi, Mike.

751
00:56:44,424 --> 00:56:47,597
- What do we got?
- Cop. Twenty plus, flipped.

752
00:56:48,286 --> 00:56:50,694
- Suicidal?
- Been to the farm twice the last four years.

753
00:56:50,956 --> 00:56:52,674
- Twice?
- Twice. Nothing like this, though.

754
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,442
- What do you know, detective?
- Like the captain said, he flipped.

755
00:56:55,862 --> 00:56:58,832
After he nailed Shue, he started
spouting crap about making headlines.

756
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,785
There's no way
that you're getting this guy out.

757
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,241
<i>Please fall back behind the barricades.
On the sidewalk.</i>

758
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:07,413
Smart cop.

759
00:57:08,723 --> 00:57:11,774
Okay. You're all gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.

760
00:57:12,376 --> 00:57:14,538
- Please, just move to the back of the bus.
- Jack?

761
00:57:15,284 --> 00:57:17,230
Just move to the back of the bus,
please, right now.

762
00:57:17,721 --> 00:57:20,274
It's okay. You're gonna get off the bus.
I am a police officer.

763
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:22,698
Jack, it's Mike Sheehan from HNT.

764
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:27,354
We worked that barricade deal
on the concourse a few years ago.

765
00:57:29,581 --> 00:57:30,928
I'm gonna put this thing down, okay?

766
00:57:36,447 --> 00:57:37,960
- I'm sorry.
- Jack!

767
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:40,052
I'm sorry that I got you
in this situation.

768
00:57:41,434 --> 00:57:42,716
You know the drill, no weapons.

769
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,759
Listen, you're on the job.

770
00:57:46,426 --> 00:57:47,520
- Just keep your head down.
- You know the deal.

771
00:57:48,568 --> 00:57:50,698
I'm just gonna step in here,
nice and easy...

772
00:57:51,707 --> 00:57:54,630
...and hand you this phone
so we can talk, okay?

773
00:57:55,332 --> 00:57:59,613
Make sure we got no injuries in there.
Jack, just open the door, okay?

774
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:03,660
- I need to...
- Just throw it, Mike!

775
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:05,117
- Okay, you got it.
- Throw it!

776
00:58:05,556 --> 00:58:07,740
Here you go. Jack...

777
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:16,162
<i>Jack, can you hear me?</i>

778
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,745
How many people you got in there, Jack?

779
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:21,310
Count how many people are here.

780
00:58:23,276 --> 00:58:24,869
Everybody put your hands up, please.

781
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:30,398
<i>N. Y.P.D., we got a situation here.
We need you people back on the sidewalk.</i>

782
00:58:30,728 --> 00:58:33,996
<i>- Stay behind the barricade.
- Twenty-six, 28. okay, thank you.</i>

783
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:37,200
That's everybody?
Please, don't cry, don't cry.

784
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:42,452
Everything's gonna be all right, just relax.
Stay calm, okay? Thank you.

785
00:58:42,707 --> 00:58:44,063
- What is it?
- Thirty-one. Thirty-one.

786
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:50,772
Okay, we have about
40 people on the bus.

787
00:58:52,081 --> 00:58:52,970
Okay, that's good.

788
00:58:54,642 --> 00:58:56,841
You know, it's important
that we're clear with each other, Jack.

789
00:58:57,738 --> 00:58:59,342
<i>ESU and HNT are in place.</i>

790
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:05,518
The block is sealed, Jack.
It's a frozen zone.

791
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:10,362
<i>So let's work this out
so everybody can go home, all right?</i>

792
00:59:11,344 --> 00:59:14,202
<i>That's all we wanna do.
Just end it, nice and easy.</i>

793
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:16,752
Jack?

794
00:59:17,409 --> 00:59:19,570
<i>Jack? This is as far as you go, buddy.</i>

795
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:21,718
<i>Keep talk...</i>

796
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,563
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah.

797
00:59:42,952 --> 00:59:44,629
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

798
00:59:45,193 --> 00:59:46,177
How are you?

799
00:59:46,835 --> 00:59:51,111
My name's Eddie. Hi, how you doing?
Everybody's okay?

800
00:59:55,914 --> 00:59:56,830
What's your name?

801
00:59:57,695 --> 00:59:59,548
- Christina.
- Christina.

802
01:00:00,423 --> 01:00:04,252
That's a pretty name.
How old are you, Christina?

803
01:00:06,032 --> 01:00:08,224
- Seven.
- Seven years old.

804
01:00:11,352 --> 01:00:14,439
And my strawberry recipe...
I know I got one. Let me see.

805
01:00:15,221 --> 01:00:17,850
Where's my strawberry recipe? Let's see.

806
01:00:18,724 --> 01:00:21,025
Angel-food-cake recipe right here.

807
01:00:22,548 --> 01:00:25,955
Here we go, strawberry fan.

808
01:00:26,978 --> 01:00:28,348
See right here on the top?

809
01:00:29,315 --> 01:00:31,038
I can put a fan on the top.

810
01:00:31,825 --> 01:00:34,884
You know, like a Chinese fan?

811
01:00:35,863 --> 01:00:37,152
I could do that.

812
01:00:38,757 --> 01:00:39,840
When's your birthday?

813
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,271
- September 22nd.
- Oh, so that's soon.

814
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:48,986
Gonna be 8 years old, huh?
That's gonna be a good day for you.

815
01:00:49,773 --> 01:00:50,864
When's your birthday?

816
01:00:52,379 --> 01:00:53,706
Today, actually.

817
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,187
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday to you.

818
01:01:02,474 --> 01:01:05,722
And, yeah, every day
is somebody's birthday, you know.

819
01:01:06,188 --> 01:01:09,114
That's gonna be the motto for my shop:

820
01:01:09,364 --> 01:01:10,947
"Every day's a birthday," you know.

821
01:01:11,472 --> 01:01:14,159
I didn't know my birthday
was gonna turn out like this, but...

822
01:01:15,315 --> 01:01:19,503
Yeah, I'm glad to be, you know,
here, alive, you know.

823
01:01:22,256 --> 01:01:23,822
<i>- Right here, Jack.
- Yeah, Sheehan.</i>

824
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:25,536
Commissioner, sir.

825
01:01:25,971 --> 01:01:27,004
<i>- Sheehan?
- Right here.</i>

826
01:01:27,915 --> 01:01:29,055
<i>All right. This is what I want.</i>

827
01:01:30,538 --> 01:01:32,706
I want you to get me
Assistant District Attorney MacDonald...

828
01:01:33,745 --> 01:01:36,475
...a court stenographer
and somebody from Tv.

829
01:01:37,629 --> 01:01:38,746
<i>Somebody that I would recognize.</i>

830
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:41,602
<i>I want them to come on the bus
and record sworn testimony.</i>

831
01:01:42,276 --> 01:01:45,786
When I get what I want,
I'll let everybody out. Safely.

832
01:01:46,445 --> 01:01:50,630
- That's a tall order. It'll take some time...
- Just do it. I'm not in the mood, okay?

833
01:01:51,277 --> 01:01:53,246
<i>Get these people here in 15 minutes...</i>

834
01:01:53,665 --> 01:01:55,962
<i>...or I'm gonna shoot
these passengers one at a time...</i>

835
01:01:56,207 --> 01:01:58,134
<i>- ... and throw them out the door.
- Jack, be cool, okay?</i>

836
01:01:58,368 --> 01:02:01,334
Let's not do anything rash.
This thing can end without bloodshed.

837
01:02:01,787 --> 01:02:03,757
<i>- Okay? We can work this...
- Fifteen minutes.</i>

838
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,793
Jack? Jack?

839
01:02:09,701 --> 01:02:10,695
He's gone.

840
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,011
All right, everybody on your feet.

841
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:18,416
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Gotta get these people off this bus.

842
01:02:18,805 --> 01:02:21,670
But you just made your call.
You called the DA. They said they'd come.

843
01:02:22,096 --> 01:02:23,699
- Everybody's coming.
- Nobody's coming, okay?

844
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:25,898
What do you mean,
nobody's coming?

845
01:02:26,107 --> 01:02:27,710
They're gonna breach this bus
in less than five minutes.

846
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,120
- They're gonna kill me, kill you...
- Jack, what about testifying?

847
01:02:32,399 --> 01:02:34,693
We're right here. We can go.
We can end this.

848
01:02:34,962 --> 01:02:36,632
- We can testify.
- Nobody's testifying.

849
01:02:38,279 --> 01:02:39,210
It's all over, Eddie.

850
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:41,413
We lose, kid.

851
01:02:54,183 --> 01:02:55,664
- Hey, Ray.
- Frank.

852
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:57,985
You?

853
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:00,868
You guys going in?

854
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:02,869
The Commissioner hasn't given us
the green light yet.

855
01:03:03,924 --> 01:03:08,208
Well, I don't need to remind you
that he shot two of us.

856
01:03:11,302 --> 01:03:12,189
Enough said.

857
01:03:13,975 --> 01:03:16,560
We got maybe 40 civilians on that bus.
Get them out.

858
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,562
I don't want anybody hurt,
including our guys.

859
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:21,882
Nobody's gonna get hurt, Commissioner.
These guys know what to do.

860
01:03:44,435 --> 01:03:45,313
When you get outside...

861
01:03:45,908 --> 01:03:47,407
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

862
01:03:47,974 --> 01:03:50,133
They'll take you to a holding area.
It'll be hectic.

863
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:52,554
- But everybody's out there...
- Listen to me, listen to me.

864
01:03:53,272 --> 01:03:55,830
Once you get outside that perimeter,
you just get lost.

865
01:03:56,518 --> 01:03:57,952
- What if they...?
- Keep moving. You just keep moving.

866
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:00,187
Come here. You look great.

867
01:04:00,609 --> 01:04:01,727
Hey, gray suit.

868
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:04,391
Got you a gray suit.

869
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,453
All right? Hands in the air, folks.
Don't look back.

870
01:04:15,535 --> 01:04:18,051
Hands in the air, you'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

871
01:04:43,365 --> 01:04:45,694
- We count 31.
- That leaves eight people on the bus.

872
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:47,898
No, I was the last one off the bus.

873
01:04:48,122 --> 01:04:50,052
The only person left on that bus
is the guy with the gun.

874
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:53,070
- Then go, do it!
- Let's go, let's go.

875
01:04:53,504 --> 01:04:55,473
- Get your people out there. Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

876
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,942
Mosley is still on the bus.
That kid is here somewhere. We checked...

877
01:05:00,395 --> 01:05:02,062
Bobby, I don't care what you checked.

878
01:05:02,317 --> 01:05:04,197
Check it again, now. Go.
You guys, that way.

879
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:22,320
This is Detective Jack Mosley.
Shield number 227.

880
01:05:33,325 --> 01:05:35,206
I guess this will be
my last will and testament.

881
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:28,811
Don't shoot!

882
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:29,957
Hold your fire!

883
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:32,186
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

884
01:06:32,516 --> 01:06:33,716
<i>- Who is that?
- Hold your fire!</i>

885
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,095
<i>- Hold your fire!
- Is it that wit from the 32?</i>

886
01:06:38,688 --> 01:06:40,364
Get on your goddamn radio.
Find out who that is.

887
01:06:40,911 --> 01:06:42,156
Guns down, hold your fire!

888
01:06:42,784 --> 01:06:43,472
Don't shoot!

889
01:06:44,257 --> 01:06:46,017
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

890
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:47,444
Don't shoot!

891
01:06:50,102 --> 01:06:51,529
Don't shoot!

892
01:06:56,035 --> 01:06:59,048
- Do not move! Step away from the bus!
- Don't shoot, hold your fire!

893
01:06:59,313 --> 01:07:00,694
- Do not shoot!
- Get away from the bus!

894
01:07:01,557 --> 01:07:02,406
Hold your fire.

895
01:07:03,596 --> 01:07:06,679
Jack. Jack, it's me. Jack Mosley!

896
01:07:07,832 --> 01:07:09,050
It's me, Eddie, Jack.

897
01:07:12,507 --> 01:07:13,228
Chuck Berry.

898
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:14,712
Chuck Berry.

899
01:07:15,849 --> 01:07:18,645
Chuck Berry,
he got locked up for armed robbery.

900
01:07:19,425 --> 01:07:21,522
He changed. He changed.

901
01:07:22,944 --> 01:07:25,645
Barry White, he stole 300 tires.

902
01:07:26,113 --> 01:07:30,771
Can you picture big Barry White
stealing 300 tires? He changed.

903
01:07:31,601 --> 01:07:33,933
You said... You said people don't change.

904
01:07:34,638 --> 01:07:36,490
- People change.
- Eddie.

905
01:07:37,715 --> 01:07:39,273
- What?
- You're killing me.

906
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:43,498
Team three, breach the bus.
Repeat, team three, breach the bus.

907
01:07:59,216 --> 01:08:00,045
Get out of the way!

908
01:08:02,288 --> 01:08:04,268
Head down!
Cover your ears and your eyes!

909
01:09:41,022 --> 01:09:41,804
The bus is empty.

910
01:09:43,395 --> 01:09:44,544
They went through the bus doors!

911
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:47,273
They're in the goddamn building!
Seal it off!

912
01:09:49,209 --> 01:09:51,293
<i>- All clear. The bus is empty.
- They've entered the building.</i>

913
01:09:54,196 --> 01:09:55,322
Seal the building, start a search.

914
01:09:55,943 --> 01:09:58,029
Remember, heads up.
He just shot two cops. Be careful.

915
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:01,741
Jack, I gotta tell you something.

916
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:04,030
Hey, man. Jack, listen to me, man.

917
01:10:04,945 --> 01:10:06,180
Jack, I wanna tell you something.

918
01:10:07,355 --> 01:10:09,617
Hold on, hold on, wait.
I gotta tell you something. It's important.

919
01:10:11,321 --> 01:10:12,322
Shit. Get up, go.

920
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:16,695
Oh, shit.

921
01:10:18,671 --> 01:10:20,774
Hey, sir. I'm a cop, all right?
I'm on the job.

922
01:10:21,264 --> 01:10:22,667
Look, I need that phone for a minute.

923
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:24,571
Look what you did to my suit, man.

924
01:10:25,213 --> 01:10:26,498
I told you you was gonna get me shot.

925
01:10:28,627 --> 01:10:29,702
It's me. I need your help.

926
01:10:30,651 --> 01:10:33,168
All this started because my friend
Maurice came by my house.

927
01:10:36,204 --> 01:10:38,837
Two days ago,
Maurice came by my house.

928
01:10:39,706 --> 01:10:40,657
He all excited.

929
01:10:41,087 --> 01:10:42,338
He got a shoebox.

930
01:10:43,777 --> 01:10:44,636
He had a gun.

931
01:10:45,248 --> 01:10:46,903
He talking about,
"Hold this for me for a little while. "

932
01:10:47,731 --> 01:10:50,105
I'm like, "I'm on parole. "
He like, "Me too. "

933
01:10:51,558 --> 01:10:53,921
Next day, somebody shot him.

934
01:10:55,779 --> 01:10:58,107
Thirty-two thousand dollars
in that shoebox.

935
01:11:01,293 --> 01:11:03,060
- That's a sign, huh?
- Yeah.

936
01:11:04,005 --> 01:11:05,372
It's a very big sign.

937
01:11:06,169 --> 01:11:07,139
Easy, easy, easy.

938
01:11:12,328 --> 01:11:15,828
You know how much it gonna take me
to open the bakery?

939
01:11:18,364 --> 01:11:20,419
Thirty-one thousand dollars.

940
01:11:21,656 --> 01:11:24,842
Jack, I got so nervous
I ran out the house.

941
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:29,563
I went to Port Authority
and I put the money in a locker.

942
01:11:34,388 --> 01:11:35,401
I get back to my house...

943
01:11:35,808 --> 01:11:37,064
...my parole officer's there...

944
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,055
...in my house.

945
01:11:39,971 --> 01:11:41,857
He got Maurice's gun in his hand.

946
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,720
He looking at me like, "That's it, Eddie. "

947
01:11:46,354 --> 01:11:47,853
And he's talking about 15 years, man.

948
01:11:48,698 --> 01:11:49,657
I got so sick.

949
01:11:50,776 --> 01:11:52,527
Then the DA came to my cell...

950
01:11:55,466 --> 01:11:56,965
...and he showed me
the picture of that cop.

951
01:11:59,872 --> 01:12:00,748
Then I met you.

952
01:12:02,293 --> 01:12:05,964
Jack, they clean them lockers out
every 24 hours.

953
01:12:08,246 --> 01:12:10,313
I had a little schedule going, man.

954
01:12:11,515 --> 01:12:12,582
Court at 10:00...

955
01:12:14,716 --> 01:12:16,264
...Port Authority at 12.

956
01:12:17,326 --> 01:12:18,942
Hey. Hey, look at me. Wake up.

957
01:12:19,889 --> 01:12:20,881
You ain't gonna die on me, are you?

958
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,561
I don't know, I never died before.

959
01:12:26,563 --> 01:12:27,626
It's not gonna happen today.

960
01:12:38,336 --> 01:12:39,565
Hey. Thank you for coming.

961
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:43,237
- What's going on?
- Look. Shot here. I think it went in and out.

962
01:12:44,895 --> 01:12:45,796
Yeah, let's get him in.

963
01:12:48,802 --> 01:12:49,579
I know you.

964
01:12:50,485 --> 01:12:51,570
- Come on.
- I was at your house.

965
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,989
- You were at my apartment?
- Had to get my gun.

966
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,662
Bigmouth.

967
01:12:57,162 --> 01:12:58,676
It was very nice, very clean.

968
01:13:01,408 --> 01:13:03,112
The police grilled me
for an hour at the hospital.

969
01:13:03,737 --> 01:13:04,552
What'd you say to them?

970
01:13:04,939 --> 01:13:06,698
That you're a self-medicating,
depressed individual.

971
01:13:06,995 --> 01:13:08,883
And you don't care
about anything or anyone.

972
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:13,456
Oh, she's honest, straightforward.
That's sexy. I like that.

973
01:13:22,996 --> 01:13:24,135
What'd you do this time, Jack?

974
01:13:24,888 --> 01:13:26,476
He saved my life a couple times.

975
01:13:28,725 --> 01:13:32,854
Hey, he's a good dude.
You gotta give him another chance.

976
01:13:33,317 --> 01:13:35,398
I don't know what he did,
but you gotta give him another chance.

977
01:13:36,505 --> 01:13:38,134
He gotta have somebody to talk to.

978
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:40,274
I'm not gonna be around.

979
01:13:43,257 --> 01:13:45,968
- Eddie, this is my sister, Diane.
- What?

980
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:48,341
She's your sister?

981
01:13:49,812 --> 01:13:50,792
Oh, man.

982
01:13:51,881 --> 01:13:54,944
I just started having a little hope for you.
Your family don't even like you.

983
01:13:55,776 --> 01:13:56,882
I got a sister too.

984
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:00,306
But she live in Seattle.

985
01:14:01,976 --> 01:14:03,872
I was supposed to go out there
and start my bakery.

986
01:14:04,279 --> 01:14:05,993
I was supposed to go out there today
to see her.

987
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:08,095
See her on the bus.

988
01:14:09,665 --> 01:14:10,641
I can stop the bleeding...

989
01:14:10,978 --> 01:14:12,680
...but he's gotta get stitched up,
get to a hospital.

990
01:14:13,868 --> 01:14:15,391
We gotta be at the courthouse
in less than 20.

991
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,401
You're gonna have to do it.

992
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:23,953
You're gonna be fine, Eddie.
It's not as bad as it looks.

993
01:14:26,274 --> 01:14:27,294
What happened to your hand?

994
01:14:29,997 --> 01:14:31,143
I gotta ask you one more favor.

995
01:14:33,732 --> 01:14:34,831
Just a little favor.

996
01:14:42,626 --> 01:14:43,776
Hey, is today really your birthday?

997
01:14:45,017 --> 01:14:45,723
No.

998
01:14:46,942 --> 01:14:49,921
No, I just said that because the little girl,
she was so scared.

999
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:52,810
She was cute, man.

1000
01:14:54,862 --> 01:14:55,703
When's your birthday?

1001
01:14:59,139 --> 01:15:01,751
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

1002
01:15:03,857 --> 01:15:05,188
No, for real, I don't know.

1003
01:15:06,593 --> 01:15:09,678
I'm not... I came up in foster care.
Had a lot of birthdays.

1004
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:14,843
But didn't you say...? You got a sister, right?
That you're going to see?

1005
01:15:15,314 --> 01:15:17,564
Yeah, I just found out about her
a couple months ago.

1006
01:15:18,334 --> 01:15:19,799
- Never met your sister?
- No.

1007
01:15:21,671 --> 01:15:23,440
That's why I'm going out to Seattle
to meet her.

1008
01:15:25,473 --> 01:15:26,595
I'm looking forward.

1009
01:15:27,234 --> 01:15:28,861
Maybe she turns out
to look like Angelina Jolie.

1010
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:32,190
Shit, if she do,
I hope she ain't my sister.

1011
01:15:36,797 --> 01:15:39,377
Hey, man, what you want
on your cake, man?

1012
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,285
You never told me.
I gotta send you one, man.

1013
01:15:42,628 --> 01:15:44,942
- I don't want no cake, Eddie.
- Damn it, Jack, come on, man...

1014
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:47,524
I can't think of anything
that has happened in my life...

1015
01:15:47,788 --> 01:15:50,523
...that I would want written on a cake.
- Nothing?

1016
01:15:53,192 --> 01:15:54,285
I'm not a good guy, Eddie.

1017
01:15:59,957 --> 01:16:01,006
I'm not a good guy.

1018
01:16:05,706 --> 01:16:06,740
Yeah, me neither.

1019
01:16:21,642 --> 01:16:22,678
- Diane.
- Frank.

1020
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:23,828
Give me the keys.

1021
01:16:24,803 --> 01:16:26,989
- Stay in the car.
- Little out of your sector, aren't you?

1022
01:16:27,674 --> 01:16:29,111
Saving lives knows no bounds.

1023
01:16:29,623 --> 01:16:31,538
- You should know that, Frank.
- You look good.

1024
01:16:32,282 --> 01:16:33,923
You look a little desperate.
Doesn't suit you.

1025
01:16:34,451 --> 01:16:35,443
Open the door.

1026
01:16:35,905 --> 01:16:37,141
Open the door. Open the door.

1027
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:41,000
Sorry, Jack, this is as close
as I can get you.

1028
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:49,217
Like I said, you're looking good.

1029
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:55,343
Thanks, kid.

1030
01:16:57,289 --> 01:16:58,360
All right, come on, let's go.

1031
01:16:58,889 --> 01:17:00,343
No, hey, hold on. Hold on a minute.

1032
01:17:01,212 --> 01:17:02,423
Why is that? Hold on for what?

1033
01:17:02,736 --> 01:17:04,016
This is as far as you go too.

1034
01:17:04,837 --> 01:17:06,384
- Come on, man. I don't...
- Listen to me, Eddie.

1035
01:17:06,909 --> 01:17:08,298
- What?
- Listen.

1036
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,455
Those guys you were gonna
testify against...

1037
01:17:13,219 --> 01:17:14,408
...those cops?
- Yeah?

1038
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:17,649
I was one of them.

1039
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:28,020
You were gonna testify against me too.

1040
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:31,973
I did what they did.

1041
01:17:33,158 --> 01:17:34,240
We did some bad things.

1042
01:17:36,599 --> 01:17:38,489
I did another bad thing when I used you.

1043
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:44,045
I was gonna let you do
what I should have done.

1044
01:17:45,004 --> 01:17:46,788
What I should have had the courage
to do six years ago.

1045
01:17:53,271 --> 01:17:54,246
I'm sorry.

1046
01:17:59,551 --> 01:18:02,306
You know, if you didn't
come to get me today...

1047
01:18:04,334 --> 01:18:05,413
...I'd be dead right now.

1048
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:08,509
- Right.
- So...

1049
01:18:10,087 --> 01:18:11,257
I was supposed to meet you.

1050
01:18:13,109 --> 01:18:14,168
That was the sign.

1051
01:18:15,861 --> 01:18:17,055
You saved my life, kid.

1052
01:18:22,742 --> 01:18:23,840
Take care of yourself, kid.

1053
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:28,070
Thank you.

1054
01:18:28,635 --> 01:18:30,402
Make cakes, Eddie the baker.

1055
01:18:39,001 --> 01:18:41,886
Oh, yeah. You give the car keys
to your best friend.

1056
01:18:42,548 --> 01:18:44,653
You let him take the old lady
to the hospital.

1057
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:49,463
You stay at the bus stop with the girl
because she's the girl of your dreams, right?

1058
01:18:50,202 --> 01:18:51,519
So everything's gonna be okay.

1059
01:18:53,589 --> 01:18:54,628
- Right?
- Yeah.

1060
01:18:56,597 --> 01:18:58,561
Have fun in Seattle. Say hi to your sister.

1061
01:18:59,026 --> 01:18:59,955
Yeah.

1062
01:19:04,595 --> 01:19:05,686
Yeah.

1063
01:19:07,185 --> 01:19:09,121
Get him to the Port Authority.
Make sure he gets on that bus.

1064
01:19:09,715 --> 01:19:11,028
- Carl, thanks.
- No problem.

1065
01:19:11,028 --> 01:19:12,237
All right.

1066
01:20:22,145 --> 01:20:23,295
Hell of a morning, huh?

1067
01:20:33,436 --> 01:20:34,296
Where's the wit?

1068
01:20:37,062 --> 01:20:37,939
You're looking at him.

1069
01:20:42,264 --> 01:20:43,489
I let the kid go, Frank.

1070
01:20:45,487 --> 01:20:48,610
- You're not gonna get to him now.
- Bullshit.

1071
01:20:50,826 --> 01:20:51,728
Wouldn't do that.

1072
01:21:01,308 --> 01:21:02,228
So...

1073
01:21:04,871 --> 01:21:05,826
...what do you think
you're gonna tell them?

1074
01:21:07,855 --> 01:21:09,031
Are you gonna tell them everything?

1075
01:21:09,978 --> 01:21:11,450
Are you gonna tell them about you too?

1076
01:21:13,874 --> 01:21:15,682
You think that's gonna
make you feel better?

1077
01:21:16,643 --> 01:21:17,887
Nothing's gonna make me feel better.

1078
01:21:18,469 --> 01:21:19,472
Then why?

1079
01:21:21,331 --> 01:21:22,590
Look, Jack, you and me...

1080
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:27,577
...we did our business in a certain way.

1081
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:33,048
You never complained
when we cleared the tough cases.

1082
01:21:33,957 --> 01:21:36,027
It didn't bother you
doing any of that until...

1083
01:21:38,762 --> 01:21:40,623
Listen to me, all right? You listen.

1084
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:43,841
Okay, Jack? Really listen.

1085
01:21:44,248 --> 01:21:46,091
Whatever you think
that you are gonna do up there...

1086
01:21:48,126 --> 01:21:49,301
...it is never gonna happen.

1087
01:21:50,812 --> 01:21:52,062
You are not gonna make it.

1088
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:55,952
Is that what you're thinking, Frank?

1089
01:21:57,688 --> 01:22:00,455
You're gonna shoot me down here?
Nobody knows?

1090
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,595
Like the Ling family, huh?

1091
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,003
Like they never knew.

1092
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,562
He was a stupid old man
who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.

1093
01:22:09,975 --> 01:22:12,094
All right, so I stuck a gun
in some guy's mouth.

1094
01:22:12,453 --> 01:22:15,381
- He had a heart attack, he died. So what?
- So what?

1095
01:22:15,813 --> 01:22:19,300
Look, if it hadn't happened
the way that it did, if he hadn't died...

1096
01:22:19,743 --> 01:22:21,678
...you would've been patting me
on the back, saying, "Good job. "

1097
01:22:22,197 --> 01:22:24,658
Collateral damage,
it is a fact of life in this business.

1098
01:22:25,219 --> 01:22:27,815
He took his last breaths while you were
wiping the fingerprints off the room.

1099
01:22:28,474 --> 01:22:31,813
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was an innocent man.

1100
01:22:32,049 --> 01:22:34,899
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's husband.

1101
01:22:35,126 --> 01:22:37,378
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's father.

1102
01:22:37,613 --> 01:22:40,270
He was gonna take down our case!
What were we supposed to do?

1103
01:22:40,505 --> 01:22:42,323
- He wanted to tell the truth.
- Fuck the truth!

1104
01:22:54,332 --> 01:22:55,286
Right.

1105
01:23:14,101 --> 01:23:15,585
I'm not gonna need this anymore.

1106
01:23:59,448 --> 01:24:01,029
<i>Bobby? He's on his way up.</i>

1107
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:02,948
Take him out.

1108
01:24:35,251 --> 01:24:37,734
Mosley's in the building!
Get the ADA. Freeze!

1109
01:24:38,061 --> 01:24:39,717
- Hands in the air!
- Don't shoot.

1110
01:24:40,062 --> 01:24:41,835
- Don't move! Down on your knees.
- I'm not armed.

1111
01:24:42,345 --> 01:24:44,921
- Down on your knees! Now!
- Don't shoot, I'm not armed.

1112
01:24:45,285 --> 01:24:48,270
Lower your weapon. Just call
ADA MacDonald, please, on the radio.

1113
01:24:48,752 --> 01:24:50,610
- Hands up.
- Get ADA MacDonald here right now!

1114
01:24:51,141 --> 01:24:53,687
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot me.
- Get your hands up!

1115
01:24:54,098 --> 01:24:55,344
Just get ADA MacDonald for me.

1116
01:24:55,657 --> 01:24:57,817
- Jack, come on!
- I won't argue with you. Get down.

1117
01:24:58,188 --> 01:24:59,602
Mosley! Mosley!

1118
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,077
Hands up!

1119
01:25:01,436 --> 01:25:03,101
Where's my witness?
Where's Edward Bunker?

1120
01:25:04,203 --> 01:25:05,190
He didn't make it.

1121
01:25:06,736 --> 01:25:07,884
I'm gonna take his place.

1122
01:25:13,759 --> 01:25:15,977
- Please lower your weapons.
- Hold your fire and stand down.

1123
01:25:16,664 --> 01:25:17,631
Back off.

1124
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:21,313
I have information...

1125
01:25:22,455 --> 01:25:24,912
...regarding your ongoing
witness-tampering investigation.

1126
01:25:26,345 --> 01:25:28,722
Dates, cases that include extortion...

1127
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:31,739
...manslaughter and possible homicide...

1128
01:25:33,259 --> 01:25:35,785
...involving members
of the 14th Precinct.

1129
01:25:37,066 --> 01:25:39,098
These charges include
Captain Dan Gruber...

1130
01:25:40,772 --> 01:25:42,100
...detectives Jerry Shue...

1131
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:44,349
...Edward Maldonado...

1132
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:47,418
...Bob Torres...

1133
01:25:48,505 --> 01:25:49,570
...Jim Mulvey...

1134
01:25:51,418 --> 01:25:52,607
...myself...

1135
01:25:54,153 --> 01:25:55,607
...and Detective Frank Nugent.

1136
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:01,787
What's this about, Mosley?
What do you want?

1137
01:26:02,978 --> 01:26:04,366
I want Edward Bunker's record expunged.

1138
01:26:05,123 --> 01:26:07,649
- Done. What else?
- Nothing else.

1139
01:26:08,404 --> 01:26:09,883
You can substantiate all this, Mosley?

1140
01:26:11,337 --> 01:26:12,258
Yeah.

1141
01:26:14,011 --> 01:26:14,683
Gun!

1142
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,282
Hold your fire. I fired that shot.

1143
01:26:29,259 --> 01:26:31,603
<i>You're gonna shoot me down here?
Nobody knows?</i>

1144
01:26:34,515 --> 01:26:35,853
<i>Like the Ling family, huh?</i>

1145
01:26:37,094 --> 01:26:38,300
<i>Like they never knew.</i>

1146
01:26:39,415 --> 01:26:41,559
<i>He was a stupid old man
who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.</i>

1147
01:26:41,886 --> 01:26:44,059
<i>All right, so I stuck a gun
in some guy's mouth.</i>

1148
01:26:44,389 --> 01:26:47,072
<i>- He had a heart attack, he died. So what?
- So what?</i>

1149
01:26:47,509 --> 01:26:49,359
<i>- So what?
- So how about he was innocent?</i>

1150
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,813
<i>- Innocent?
- How about he didn't deserve to die?</i>

1151
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:55,576
<i>Look, if it hadn't happened
the way that it did, if he hadn't died...</i>

1152
01:26:56,043 --> 01:26:57,900
<i>...you would've been patting me
on the back, saying, "Good job. "</i>

1153
01:26:58,403 --> 01:27:00,701
<i>Collateral damage,
it is a fact of life in this business.</i>

1154
01:27:01,918 --> 01:27:04,091
<i>He took his last breaths while you were
wiping the fingerprints off the room.</i>

1155
01:27:04,422 --> 01:27:07,640
<i>- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was an innocent man.</i>

1156
01:27:07,888 --> 01:27:11,174
<i>- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's husband.</i>

1157
01:27:11,174 --> 01:27:14,361
<i>- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's father.</i>

1158
01:27:14,583 --> 01:27:16,313
<i>He was gonna take down our case!
What were we supposed to do?</i>

1159
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:18,350
<i>- He wanted to tell the truth.
- Fuck the truth!</i>

1160
01:27:23,254 --> 01:27:24,255
Let's get you to the jury.

1161
01:27:39,276 --> 01:27:40,369
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

1162
01:27:40,697 --> 01:27:41,416
Okay.

1163
01:27:58,449 --> 01:28:00,502
- Hey, happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Jack.

1164
01:28:00,907 --> 01:28:01,981
Welcome back, Jack.

1165
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:04,983
- Are you kidding me?
- Two years in the pen is enough.

1166
01:28:05,516 --> 01:28:06,872
Thanks for that memory. Thank you.

1167
01:28:07,562 --> 01:28:08,940
- Happy birthday, Jack.
- Happy birthday.

1168
01:28:09,309 --> 01:28:11,203
- Happy birthday. Blow them out.
- Welcome home.

1169
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:13,248
I hate birthdays, you know that, right?

1170
01:28:16,512 --> 01:28:17,592
- Sorry, sorry.
- Happy birthday.

1171
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:29,038
This came with it.

1172
01:28:41,237 --> 01:28:42,156
<i>Dear Jack Mosley:</i>

1173
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:46,742
<i>I hope you're doing well and everything
worked out like it was supposed to.</i>

1174
01:28:47,816 --> 01:28:48,718
<i>I'm doing great.</i>

1175
01:28:49,815 --> 01:28:51,549
<i>Seattle is different, and I like it a lot.</i>

1176
01:28:51,925 --> 01:28:54,971
<i>I'm not sure I ever smelled fresh air
before I got here. It's a trip.</i>

1177
01:28:56,407 --> 01:28:59,158
<i>Sometimes I can't believe it.
It's the best feeling I've had in my life.</i>

1178
01:29:00,305 --> 01:29:01,987
<i>I'm busting my ass,
but I'm happy, though.</i>

1179
01:29:05,567 --> 01:29:08,131
<i>The bakery is now open. Three cheers.</i>

1180
01:29:09,527 --> 01:29:11,847
<i>I put my name first
because I'm doing all the hard work.</i>

1181
01:29:12,161 --> 01:29:13,411
<i>These ovens are hot, man.</i>

1182
01:29:14,617 --> 01:29:16,396
<i>Hope you like the cake.
What did I tell you?</i>

1183
01:29:17,161 --> 01:29:20,492
<i>- That's Eddie.
- If you're ever in town, you got a friend.</i>

1184
01:29:21,411 --> 01:29:23,690
<i>Thank you for doing the right thing,
Jack Mosley. God bless you.</i>

1185
01:29:24,741 --> 01:29:27,456
<i>Keep in touch. Peace.</i>

1186
01:29:28,779 --> 01:29:29,981
- That's great.
- Go on, take one more. Look.

1187
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:34,119
You know how this guy...?
I was talking, take one more.

1188
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:37,804
<i>Happy birthday, Jack.</i>
