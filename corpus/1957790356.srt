the up-front pages,

00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:35,895
And you call yourself
the king of the forest.

00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:36,896
Sheesh.

365
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,165
Target in sight.

366
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:40,367

00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,302
Direct hit.

368
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,537
Uh-oh.

369
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,509

Ah!
Ah!

373
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,930
Guess they never
heard the saying

374
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,999
"birds of a feather
flock together."

Odds are way--i say--
way up on tweety.

378
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:26,345
Right now, it looks
like our bird's
heading for Tibet.

379
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,447
Tibet?

380
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,615
He's supposed
to be the one

381
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:30,049
everyone else
is wagering on.

382
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:35,354
No, no, son.
Tibet the country,
not the infinitive.

383
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,089
Uh, verb, that is.

384
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,559
Well, why didn't
you say so?

385
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,396
Nice boy,
but his skylight
leaks a little.

Say, what
a spectacular view.

392
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,817
Strange. I didn't know
there was anything else

393
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,453
built this high
up in the himalayas.

394
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,427
Subtle, isn't it?

395
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:57,537
Hmm. Looks like these
locals are gonna put on

396
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,438

00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,464
that poor little canary
in the name of a statue

404
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,133

What force of nature

411
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:58,798
dares disrupt our peaceful
canary sacrifice?

Now, take this down.

to sacrifice any more birds,

we do with ourselves
on Saturday nights?

a friend here

a little kitty cat

to call my own.

Why not? Just one
question, awooga.

call you awooga?

in New York.

1070
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:20,844
[Gasps]
I should have taken
the concorde.

1071
01:06:20,844 --> 01:06:22,579
I could've been
a contender.

1072
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:24,381
[Ho-o-onk!]

1073
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:29,653
Holy smoke! You mean
that subtitle was wrong?

1074
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,188
Mm-hmm.

1075
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:33,490
Tch, tch, tch.

1076
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,226
You just can't get
good help hiring
freelance.

1077
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:40,397
You see,
we picked up a day

1078
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:42,399
crossing
the international
date line here

1079
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:45,502
but then thought
we lost it in
the hurricane here.

1080
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:48,038
But I lost my infallible
inner sense of time
here, too.

1081
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:50,407
What kept me on track
after that?

1082
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:53,510
Tweety, don't you have
someplace to be
right now?

1083
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,279
Oh, my gosh!

1084
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:00,417
Oh, no, granny...

1085
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:03,019
'Tisn't easy
admitting defeat.

1086
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,021
You should have heard
my sage wisdom

1087
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,858
before you made this
foolhardy wager.

1088
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,694
[Tweeting]

1089
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:12,028
Can it be?

1090
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,697
It is!

1091
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:15,031
Tweety!

1092
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,032
What?!

1093
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,768
Yay!
Yay!

1094
01:07:19,936 --> 01:07:21,037
Hmph!

1095
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,639
This is most
unexpected.

1096
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,241
Hmph! Let's see...

1097
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:27,177
France and Italy,
check and check.

1098
01:07:27,177 --> 01:07:29,813
So this is your new
friend, eh, tweety?

1099
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:31,648
Birdy! Birdy!
Birdy! Birdy!

1100
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:35,352
Hold it!
Just a minute!

1101
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:37,721
This document
is incomplete!

1102
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:42,526
There are but 79
feline impressions
in here!

1103
01:07:42,526 --> 01:07:43,560
Huh?

1104
01:07:45,095 --> 01:07:48,165
Oh, my gosh!
I forgot Sylvester!

1105
01:07:54,504 --> 01:07:56,240
Sylvester: Hey,
cut it out!

1106
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,774
That tickles!

1107
01:07:57,774 --> 01:07:59,443
Pawprint number 80!

1108
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,714
Oh...balderdash!

1109
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:06,383
All right,
all right!

1110
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:08,518
Blast it!
You win!

1111
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,823
The park and my Nash
hubcaps are saved!

1112
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:16,860
Confidentially,

1113
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,628
my sympathy
was, like,

1114
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:20,264
with the bird.

1115
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,535
British woman:
I dub thee sir tweety

1116
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:29,739
for helping recover
the stolen royal passport.

1117
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,142
Thank you.

1118
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:37,247
I also have an infallible
inner sense of time,

1119
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,516
but why spoil it
for him?

1120
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:45,355
