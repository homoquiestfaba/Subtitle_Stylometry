- Rubble, smoke machines.
- (Chuckles) Yes.

178

Last year, I was involved in a hit-and-run.

183
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:35,021
I accidentally killed a man.

Then soon became a hooker.

00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:53,372

No, we're not prostitutes. We're escorts.

197
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:07,970
And then it turned into
her writing a... a blog

198
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:10,256
that was sort of a sexy
"Fifty Shades of Grey" blog,

199
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:13,092
and then publishing it as a book.

200
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:14,560

Dixon was kind of always
getting himself into trouble.

He had a gambling addiction,

addiction to...

217

- (Lara) A.D.H.D. Meds.
- Yeah.

218
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:50,513
Dixon, I'm not leaving until we
talk about your drug addiction.

What is this, an afterschool special?

220

Tristan, who plays Dixon, is
really passionate about music,

221
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:57,419
and Tristan helped us sort
of discover that in Dixon,

222
00:07:57,421 --> 00:08:01,140
and that eventually became a
big part of Dixon's character.

224
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:06,956
Annie always made sure to look
out for her younger brother.

$40,000? Annie, we can't afford that.

You just concentrate
on getting better, okay?

227
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,329
I will take care of the money.

228
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:16,348
The final moment between Annie and Dixon

229
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,136
is Dixon telling Annie, "I'm
gonna look out for you, too."

230
00:08:20,138 --> 00:08:23,055
For me, uh, playing Silver,

231
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:24,807
I've loved her. I've respected her.

232
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:26,859
Um, she's been difficult.

233
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:28,027
It's like chemistry.

234
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,345
Like... baking soda and vinegar.

235
00:08:30,347 --> 00:08:33,399
You can put vinegar with
something other than baking soda

236
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:34,900
and it won't react the same way.

237
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:38,370
S... so my movie in this
example is the vinegar.

238
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:41,540
That was something that I
was really passionate about,

239
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,409
was having a bipolar character.

240
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:46,112
And philosophically, it was important to me

241
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:48,748
to say that having a
mental health condition

242
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,866
wasn't defining as a person.

243
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:53,252
(Sobbing) It doesn't make sense.

244
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:55,721
But it did! It did make sense!

245
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:58,974
Playing those episodes where
she is in a manic episode,

246
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:00,926
and saying lines so fast

247
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:02,494
and trying to put everything in order,

248
00:09:02,496 --> 00:09:04,080
is some of the most difficult work

249
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:06,465
that I've ever gotten to do.

250
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,267
And, uh, I'm grateful for that.

255
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:20,946
involving her own genetic
link to breast cancer,

256
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:24,166
and that became kind of a
big part of... of her life

257
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:26,452
- in the next two seasons.
- Right.

258
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:28,404

that I need to go through alone.

don't just affect you!</i>

Navid started as a good guy.

very genuine about him.

00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:56,395
everybody's trust and forgiveness.

349
00:12:56,337 --> 00:12:59,639
(Voice breaks) I'm gonna
try and be a better person.

350
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:02,475
I'm not gonna give up.

352
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:07,814
Naomi started off as evil queen bitch

353
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:10,683
of Beverly Hills... West Bev 90210.

354
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:12,568
- Good morning, skank.
- Get a life, Naomi.

355
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,738
And then you see towards
the end where she...

356
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,907
I mean, well, in the very end,

357
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:19,191
- she's as narcissistic as she's ever been.
- Yeah.

358
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:21,911
But there were moments
in there when she had

359
00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:24,664
some genuine concern for
people's well-being. (Laughs)

360
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,865
(Audience gasps)

361
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:28,885
(Amplified voice) So here
I stand, a former bitch,

362
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:31,037
asking for you forgiveness.

363
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,806
Please don't let the message get lost

364
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:35,975
just because I'm physically perfect.

365
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:37,510
Naomi always has been a mix

366
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:39,662
of likable and unlikable qualities.

367
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:41,431
And the sort of buoyancy and energy

368
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:42,849
that Annalynne brings.

369
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:46,069
(Amplified voice) It seems...
that the winner is a write-in.

370
00:13:46,071 --> 00:13:47,270
(Giggles)

371
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:50,056
(Laughs) Is that fair?

372
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:51,491
Annalynne just cracks me up.

373
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:54,260
I mean, she just... she
just... slaughters me.

374
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:55,561
I mean, she's just hilarious.

375
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:57,497
I remember season two when
the new showrunner came in.

376
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:59,532
She's like, "you're funny.
We're gonna write you funny",

377
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:00,867
and I'm like...

378
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:02,335
(Dramatic voice) "I am not
funny. I am very serious".

379
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:05,338
(laughs) She's like, "no,
no. You're hilarious."

380
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,507
You all are beautiful women.

381
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:09,241
(Chuckles) I see a bit
of me in each of you,

382
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:11,577
and I love that part of me.

383
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,080
The only person that gets laughs
in the read-through is this one.

384
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:15,932
(Laughing) And everyone
else is like, "wah-wah-wah."

385
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,717
And then Annalynne says two words,

386
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,802
and everyone's like, "blah! Ha ha ha!"

387
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:21,253
It's awesome.

388
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:22,689
Namaste, bitches.

389
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:24,256
I can't shop. I can't spa.

390
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:26,926
I... I might as well eat
fast food out of a trash can.

391
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:28,221
If I have to endure this
game for one more minute,

392
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:29,673
I swear to God,

393
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:31,258
I will bake a cake six stories
high and jump off the top of it.

394
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,093
This is the most pathetic pity party ever.

395
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:34,544
Seriously, somebody cue the sad music,

396
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:35,812
break out the Chardonnay,

397
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:36,980

00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:45,856
Now, like, we've been together for so long,

403
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:47,908
we're... when one actor is not there,

404
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,278
we just suddenly start
pretending to be them.

405
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,915
It was like, "oh, I'm... I'm
Liam. I'm brooding and angry."

406
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:57,233
It's like... (Laughs) and then there's...

Hi, I'm Aisha Tyler, host of the

412
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:14,903
which premieres this summer on the CW.

413
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:17,093
We're gonna play a game right

414
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:20,158
with Ryan Stiles, Colin
Mochrie and Wayne Brady

415
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:21,973
with music from Laura
Hall, and Linda Taylor.

416
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,682
Ryan and Colin are two
TV voice-over artists

417
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:26,696
talking about the latest compilation album

418
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:29,180

snippets of the song,

419
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:31,669

420

the greatest zip code since 4...

426
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,882
Is it a zip code?

427
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:46,847
I never realized it was a zip code!

428
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:48,579
Oh, now the show makes sense.

You know Colin, I love my r'n'b,

430
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:52,758
but I love my upbeat r'n'b,

431
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,030
my sexy r'n'b...

432
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:57,326
I'm not even sure what it
stands for, but I love it!

524

Oh, my God! That is it!

528
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,068
You've probably seen the episode
where she was directing a video

529
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,320
- that Liam was in.
- And... action.

(Rebecca) What was interesting about Teddy,

609
00:23:06,016 --> 00:23:07,315
which is something that happens in TV,

610
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:08,433
is you create a character one way,

611
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:10,969
and then you watch the character evolve

612
00:23:10,971 --> 00:23:13,338
in ways that you hadn't anticipated.

613
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,723
But it had occurred to me in season two

614
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:18,193
that there was more to
that character than we knew.

615
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:19,945
What, uh, what were you guys talking about?

616
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:22,197
Why does this guy keep
talking about being a player?

617
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,398
I mean, every episode he was going like,

618
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,732
"I'm a player. I'm a player.

619
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:26,501
Watch out, Silver. I'm a player."

620

stick with the counts.

622

Mm. Okay, watch Navid.

Yeah! Watch the master.

624
00:23:34,344 --> 00:23:36,428
I... I'm proud of that
story for two reasons.

625
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,297
One, because I feel like
people really did respond

626
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:40,748
and it was meaningful and had some effect.

627
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,634
And also because I feel like we were able

628
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:46,254
to tell it in a way that
took every sort of zig and zag

629
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:47,522
as he came out.

630
00:23:47,524 --> 00:23:48,857
What... what is wrong with you?

631
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,192
Look, sorry if I can't dance,

634

that is in high school.

like the end of the world

641
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:14,416
How am I supposed to ask someone

642
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:16,334
to be okay with who I am when...

643
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:19,137
I'm not?

644
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:22,340
Your friends... we love you.

645
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:26,344
And I love you even more now
that I know who you really are.

646
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:32,067
It impacted some kids out there,
and they let me know, and it's...

647
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:34,102
that's when it starts to
get, like, touching, you know.

648
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:37,239
Like you're doing it for a purpose.

649

weird feeling to be done.

655
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:51,286

00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:21,901
You know, it's that desperation.

696
00:26:21,903 --> 00:26:24,387
It's that, like, raw teen love.

697
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:28,408
It's okay. I'm here, and
I'm gonna help you get help.

698
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:32,278
♪ It's not just all physical ♪

699
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,446
When I think about the show,

700
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:35,398
I always think of Navid and Adrianna

701
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,533
'cause we were together

702
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:38,451
for, like, three out of the five seasons.

703
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:40,119
<i>Okay, I... I know I am a lot of drama</i>

704
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:42,088
<i>and I... I just didn't think... (Sighs)</i>

705
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,706
that you liked me.

706
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,175
<i>Well, I do.</i>

707
00:26:45,177 --> 00:26:48,344
No one can compete with you.

708
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:49,379
(Girls) Aw!

709
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:51,381
♪ I want you close, I want you ♪

710
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:54,434
♪ I won't treat you like you're typical ♪

711
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:57,604
(Cheering)

712
00:26:57,606 --> 00:26:59,689
And fans get really attached,
which is cool, you know?

713
00:26:59,691 --> 00:27:01,107
Yeah. But at the same time,

714
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:03,226
- they get very upset when you break up.
- (Laughs) (Laughs)

715
00:27:03,228 --> 00:27:07,030
The fans seem to love Liam and Annie.

716
00:27:07,032 --> 00:27:11,201
When I heard that you were in the hospital,

717
00:27:11,203 --> 00:27:14,938
I just... I felt like my
heart stopped or something.

718
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:18,992
If you weren't okay, then...

719
00:27:18,994 --> 00:27:20,977
I wouldn't be okay.

720
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:23,663
I've loved you...

721
00:27:23,665 --> 00:27:25,748
for a long time.

722
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,918
♪ All I wanna know is ♪

723
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,089
♪ can you come a little closer? ♪

724
00:27:34,892 --> 00:27:36,009
I think it was fun

725
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:37,610
whenever we would put
two characters together

726
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:40,630
who hadn't been together to
sort of see what would happen.

727
00:27:40,632 --> 00:27:43,850
Like, I don't think anybody
expected Dixon and Adrianna

728
00:27:43,852 --> 00:27:44,984
to get together.

729
00:27:44,986 --> 00:27:46,436
Are we a couple?

730
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:49,138
Or... or did you just
have sex with me in Vegas

731
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,190
just to keep me away from drugs?

732
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:53,826
And I think we really enjoyed
and all the writers enjoyed

733
00:27:53,828 --> 00:27:55,328
Silver and Liam.

734
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,247
Silver, wait. We need to talk.

735
00:27:57,249 --> 00:27:59,616
I think we could be great together.

736
00:27:59,618 --> 00:28:01,251
- Liam...
- No, no, let me finish.

737
00:28:01,253 --> 00:28:02,502
I let you walk away

738
00:28:02,504 --> 00:28:04,287
because I thought I needed
to be everything for you.

739
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:07,173
And the truth is, I don't
want a baby right now.

740
00:28:07,175 --> 00:28:08,324
<i>But I do want you.</i>

741
00:28:08,326 --> 00:28:11,344
I think the fans of... of Annie and Liam

742
00:28:11,346 --> 00:28:13,129
didn't enjoy it as much.

743
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:14,347
Look, Liam...

744
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:16,349
I just wanna jump his
bones every time I see him.

745
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:17,350
(Chuckles)

746
00:28:17,352 --> 00:28:20,219
We have this connection.

747
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:23,506
I... I'm sorry. Is this
weird to talk to you about?

748
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:24,724
Yeah.

749
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:27,694
Always wanted to put Navid with Naomi.

750
00:28:27,696 --> 00:28:29,178
(Chuckles) We just need
a couple more episodes,

751
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,814
and we could have made that happen.

752
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:34,016
Although it does seem
like everybody might...

753
00:28:34,018 --> 00:28:35,285
sleep with everybody,

754
00:28:35,287 --> 00:28:38,288
or, you know, someone is
punching someone in the face...

755
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,239
(Both grunt) (Camera shutter clicks)

756
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:41,708
You know, but that's what friends do.

757
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,077
We're a very resilient
group of kids. (Laughs)

758
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,028
Like, we forgive each other really easily.

759
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,830
Man, I swear, I will never let a girl

760
00:28:47,832 --> 00:28:50,166
come between me and a friend again.

761
00:28:50,168 --> 00:28:51,584
Bro code.

762
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:55,338
I feel like they showed, like,
a really real kind of side

763
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,556
to friendships and relationships,

764
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:58,541
and it has its ups and downs,

765
00:28:58,543 --> 00:28:59,809
- but at the end of the day...
- Mm-hmm.

766
00:28:59,811 --> 00:29:01,928
We're all friends, and we're still friends.

767
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,147
- Mm-hmm.
- And we got through everything together.

768
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:07,150
This is just the greatest...

769
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:09,102
as a group of actors.

770
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:11,154
- They're great to work with.
- They're great to work with.

771
00:29:11,156 --> 00:29:13,740
And it is, like, a little group of friends

772
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:15,942
and cool people that
you wanna hang out with.

773
00:29:15,944 --> 00:29:18,361
I was always inspired by
how they were off camera

774
00:29:18,363 --> 00:29:21,414
and wanted to sort of capture some of that

775
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:23,333
natural effervescence.

776
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:25,168
This is a serious amount of time that...

777
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,836
that I've spent with these people

778
00:29:26,838 --> 00:29:28,371
in the last five years.

779
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:29,756
And... and I haven't spent this much time

780
00:29:29,758 --> 00:29:32,908
with anybody else that's in my, you know,

781
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:37,430
close life right now because
I live at "90210" I know.

782
00:29:37,432 --> 00:29:40,350
(Tristan) If you understood half
of the stuff that we had to do...

783
00:29:40,352 --> 00:29:44,354
the photo shoots, the flying everywhere...

784
00:29:44,356 --> 00:29:45,855
it was like a fraternity or a sorority.

785
00:29:45,857 --> 00:29:47,256
It kind of forged us as a family.

786
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:49,726
Like so much so, that
whenever there was anybody new,

787
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:52,111
like... and I'm sorry, Matt,

788
00:29:52,113 --> 00:29:53,780
and, Lowndes, when you see this, I'm sorry,

789
00:29:53,782 --> 00:29:56,399
but, you know, you guys
were outcasts at first.

790
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:58,434
Like, we really... we really had to,

791
00:29:58,436 --> 00:30:00,787
like, make sure that you
were okay to be a part

792
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:02,905
of the family kind of thing.

793
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:04,540
(Laughs) I'm still waiting on the okay.

794
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:06,542
(Laughter)

795
00:30:06,544 --> 00:30:09,746
It took years to really figure out

796
00:30:09,748 --> 00:30:13,049
where we all fit into each other's lives.

797
00:30:13,051 --> 00:30:14,534
We've had our ups and our downs,

798
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:17,136
but we are the only ones
who have ever experienced

799
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:18,504
what we experienced,

800
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:22,558
and, like, for that, it's
our story. It's our family.

801
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,245
We've all come to a place
where we know exactly where

802
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:28,765
each of us fit into that family,

803
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:30,900
and it is... I always say it's like

804
00:30:30,902 --> 00:30:32,268
a dysfunctional functioning family.

805
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,403
Yeah. (Laughs) (Laughs)

806
00:30:33,405 --> 00:30:35,188
- We put the "fun" in dysfunction.
- Yeah.

807
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,774
(Laughs) Exactly. (Laughs)

808
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:38,775
Steger is... (Speaks indistinctly)

809
00:30:38,777 --> 00:30:40,576
Is the goofball of the group. He...

810
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:42,078
I call him a puppy dog.

811
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,480
This is sweet Steger.
He's all cute and cuddly.

812
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:46,315
No, no, no. There's a sexy Steger

813
00:30:46,317 --> 00:30:48,501
- that came out one day...
- Yeah, I don't know what she's talking about.

814
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:49,702
(Speaks indistinctly)

815
00:30:49,704 --> 00:30:50,920
(Speaks indistinctly)
What are you talking about?

816
00:30:50,922 --> 00:30:52,338
I'm so uncomfortable. Right?

817
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,191
- I feel totally uncomfortable.
- No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

818
00:30:59,314 --> 00:31:02,449
And now, the CW's "Whose
Line Is It Anyway?"

819
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,015
takes a look back at 90210.

820
00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:08,074
Hi, I'm Aisha Tyler, host of the
new "Whose Line is it Anyway?"

821
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,176
premiering this summer on the CW.

822
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:12,880
And this is a very special 90210 addition

823
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:14,794
of your game Scenes From a Hat.

824
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,459
So, over to Ryan Styles,

825
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:19,825
Colin Mochrie, Wayne Brady and
special guest Jonathan Mangum,

826
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,583
to give us some deleted scenes

827
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:23,980
from 90210. Take it away.

828
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:28,403
Just gotta study.

829
00:31:28,415 --> 00:31:29,998
(Laughs)

830
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:35,941
(Laughs) (Buzzer)

831
00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:41,673
Son, I'm so disappointed in you

832
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:46,151
I can't show it because my botox
has just rendered me completely...

833
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:49,323
(Laughs) (Buzzer)

834
00:31:52,396 --> 00:31:55,174
Ok, then, it's decided. For the next
year, we're all gonna be celibate!

835
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:58,383
(Laughs) (Buzzer)

836
00:32:00,648 --> 00:32:01,749
Oh my God...

837
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:03,589
I'm in 90211!

838
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:06,167
(Laughs) (Buzzer)

839
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,539
Hi guys.

840
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:11,217
I'm a mature student.

841
00:32:12,343 --> 00:32:14,470
(Laughs) (Buzzer)

842
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:21,190
Hey, I'm the other black guy.

843
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,743
(Laughs) (Buzzer)

844
00:32:26,808 --> 00:32:28,034
You took mine.

845
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:35,592
Heyyy! I'm the 9021-"ho".

846
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:38,770

You know what's funny?

850
00:32:48,245 --> 00:32:49,311
I was actually talking to, uh,
one of the producers last night.

851
00:32:49,313 --> 00:32:52,414
She was, like, you guys have no idea.

852
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:53,749
Shows aren't like this.

853
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:57,319
People don't get along this
well and care this much.

854
00:32:57,321 --> 00:33:00,239

(Annalynne) When we got the
news that the show was ending,

872
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:49,221
I went on Twitter and I
was letting everyone know,

873
00:33:49,223 --> 00:33:52,891
and one of my fans said, "it's
really cool how Aannalynne

874
00:33:52,893 --> 00:33:54,426
is talking to us like
we've been her friends

875
00:33:54,428 --> 00:33:56,094
for the last five years".

876
00:33:56,096 --> 00:33:58,230
And I thought that that
was really, really cool,

877
00:33:58,232 --> 00:34:01,733
because I do want our fans to feel like

878
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:04,236
- they've been Naomi Clark and Annie Wilson's friends.
- Yeah.

879
00:34:04,238 --> 00:34:06,321
Like, they've been with us on this journey,

880
00:34:06,323 --> 00:34:08,991
and... and I want them to
feel that personal connection.

881
00:34:08,993 --> 00:34:10,575
I hope people who watched, um,

882
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:12,361
are left with, you know, good memories,

883
00:34:12,363 --> 00:34:14,196
that it was a cool piece of history,

884
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:15,897
a cool piece of our times.

885
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,834
<i>This place definitely doesn't suck.</i>

886
00:34:18,836 --> 00:34:21,036
I hope that kids kind of feel that.

887
00:34:21,038 --> 00:34:22,170
Yeah. I mean, you know,

888
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:23,755
if they cry a little, I won't be upset.

00:34:25,843 --> 00:34:26,908

891
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,844
(Laughs) Yeah.

892
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:30,929
When we wrapped our first
actor a few days ago,

893
00:34:30,931 --> 00:34:33,081
which was, like, no, this can't be.

894
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,600
This can't be over. This
is actually happening.

895
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:38,827
Getting to work on "90210"
was about getting to work

896
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:41,330
with all these people
who were all contributing

897
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:43,865
to this crazy, crazy world.

898
00:34:43,867 --> 00:34:45,300
It's something that
I'm really grateful for.

899
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:48,703
We have all had some
really great times together.

I want people to, you know, feel like

901
00:34:51,342 --> 00:34:54,176
- they grew up with us, too, you know? And...
- Yeah.

902
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:56,595
And have fond memories and stuff like that,

903
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:59,431
that mark a generation.

904
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:01,333
I think it's great that,

905
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:04,069
you know, fans have been able
to have "90210" for 5 years,

906
00:35:04,071 --> 00:35:07,739
and some, you know, probably
started high school with us

907
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:10,392
and graduated high school with us.

908
00:35:10,394 --> 00:35:12,727
Look at as... the beginning
of the rest of our lives.
