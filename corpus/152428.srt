1
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,134
The city of Townsville...

2
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:37,105
...is in some serious...

3
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:42,075
...serious, serious trouble!

4
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:43,337
Day after day...

5
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:49,345
...crime, lawlessness
and evil are running rampant.

6
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:51,749
Its citizens have lost all hope.

7
00:00:53,123 --> 00:00:58,493
They are utterly helpless
and in desperate need of a true hero.

8
00:00:58,662 --> 00:00:59,959
But who?

9
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,497
Is there no one who can help
this forsaken town...

10
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:06,261
...and make it a better place?

11
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:12,534
Fear not, fair viewers, for there
is a man, a man of science...

12
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:17,169
...a forward-thinking man,
who looks back to a sweeter time...

13
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:25,281
... when there was spice to life,
and everything was...nice.

14
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,149
I must profess, sir...

15
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:34,696
... this man holds the ingredients
to Townsville 's salvation!

16
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:37,629
This man, known simply as:

17
00:01:38,602 --> 00:01:40,126
The Professor.

18
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,846
Hi!

19
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,748
What's your name?

20
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:43,954
My name is Professor.
Professor Utonium. Hello!

21
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:48,291
Hello, Professor Utonium.
It's very nice to meet you.

22
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:51,030
It's very nice to meet you too.

23
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:56,631
-What are your names?.
-You made us, so shouldn't you name us?.

24
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:01,775
Okay. This is so cool!

25
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:03,640
Well, now, let's see.

26
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:09,217
Because of your directness and opening
right up to me, I think I'll call you...

27
00:04:09,386 --> 00:04:10,546
...Blossom.

28
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:17,226
Well, aren't you all cute and bubbly!
That's it! You'll be my little...

29
00:04:17,394 --> 00:04:18,383
...Bubbles.

30
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:21,861
So we have Blossom, Bubbles and...

31
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,463
...Buttercup. Because...

32
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:26,602
...it also begins with a B.

33
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,331
And together you are
three perfect little g--

34
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:34,739
Gifts! Birthday! It's your birthday!
I should get gifts!

35
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:39,041
Wow! I wanted to make some kids
I could teach right from wrong...

36
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:42,913
...and in turn, maybe they'd do good
for this town, and now I can!

37
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:46,782
All I gotta do is be a good parent.

38
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,861
Note to self:. Good parents
don't leave kids alone.

39
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,964
Sugar, spice and everything nice.

40
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:58,362
Who knew that's what girls
were made of!

41
00:04:58,535 --> 00:05:01,095
I can't believe I made perfect girls!

42
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,239
Three normal little gi--

43
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:08,301
You should be careful when coming
down the steps! You could get hurt.

44
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:10,946
Hey, are these for us?.

45
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:16,551
Thanks, Professor!

46
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,609
-Hey, thanks!
-Yes, Professor! Thank you.

47
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:44,110
This is the best gift ever...

48
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:46,511
...Dad.

49
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,082
Yes, it is.

50
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:17,979
Okay, girls, now watch me.

51
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:27,883
I think you missed a spot.

52
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,122
I'll go wash up,
then we'll bring in the furniture.

53
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,560
Girls, wait! You should let me--

54
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:40,362
Help?.

55
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:48,773
This looks pretty good.
What do you think?.

56
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:52,440
-I think it's a little dark.
-I like it dark.

57
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:56,949
-Some windows might be nice.
-Yeah! I could see some windows.

58
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,418
Right about here.

59
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,682
I'll call a contractor tomor--

60
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:12,667
Or that works too.

61
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:14,394
Who's hungry?.

62
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:15,833
-Ready?.
-Ready!

63
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:17,495
Go!

64
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:47,500
Okay, girls. Time for--

65
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,209
Bed.

66
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:38,877
-Wake up, girls! Time for school.
-What's school?.

67
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:42,320
This is school.
I'm your teacher, Ms. Keane...

68
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:46,553
...and this is where
kids come to learn. See?.

69
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:52,732
You wanna play?.

70
00:08:58,908 --> 00:09:00,432
Do you think they'll be okay?.

71
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,603
I'm new at this parenting thing,
and I wanted to meet you...

72
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:08,512
...because they're really special.
I mean, really special...

73
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:14,646
...and I just want to make sure they'll
be okay. Do you think they'll be okay?.

74
00:09:15,825 --> 00:09:19,522
They'll be just fine, Professor.
We'll see you at noon.

75
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:25,794
Okay. Bye, girls. Bye. Bye.
Bye-bye. Bye. Bye.

76
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:30,266
Okay, class. Take your seats.

77
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,001
-Can Blossom sit with us?.
-Can we sit with Bubbles?.

78
00:09:34,177 --> 00:09:35,769
Can Buttercup sit here?.

79
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:40,507
The girls can sit right in the middle,
so they'll be next to everyone.

80
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:45,554
Now, let's begin!

81
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:52,486
Hello, Professor.
Right on time.

82
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:54,926
Your girls are outside
with the others.

83
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:57,828
Oh, no! Look at this mess.

84
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:01,630
I knew the girls would
be a handful, but I'm so sorry.

85
00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:03,396
What, this?.

86
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:06,872
This is what happens
when you put 20 kids in one room.

87
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:08,806
Your girls were perfect.

88
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:11,947
Perfect, normal,
well-behaved little girls.

89
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:15,676
-Nothing out of the ordinary?.
-No. Like what?.

90
00:10:18,588 --> 00:10:22,649
-That was sweet!
-What's the point of this game, anyway?.

91
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:25,191
Tag! You're it!

92
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,700
Everyone's running from her
like she's been infected!

93
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,328
-Maybe she's a freak.
-Yeah, and they hate her!

94
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:39,407
-You're it!
-Tag! You're it!

95
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:42,443
Oh, no! I've been affected!

96
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:47,140
-All right, what's going on here?.
-I've been affected!

97
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:50,548
You're not infected, it's just a game.

98
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,415
-lt is?.
-Yeah.

99
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:56,355
-A game?. Neat!
-Yeah, how do we play?.

100
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,786
Okay, look, it's very simple.
Bubbles, tag me.

101
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:04,165
Come on, it's okay.

102
00:11:07,804 --> 00:11:10,102
All right, now I'm it.

103
00:11:10,273 --> 00:11:15,677
And all you gots to do to play
is tag someone else, and they're it.

104
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,141
By the way, you're it!

105
00:11:18,314 --> 00:11:21,374
Awesome, I'm it! What do I do?.
What do I do?.

106
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:27,285
Just tag someone else,
and they're it!

107
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:41,231
Time to put it into overdrive,
Bubbles!

108
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,387
Tag! You're it!

109
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,821
I'm gonna tag you guys now.

110
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:18,199
You missed us!

111
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:27,709
-Tag! You're it!
-No! No, I'm not!

112
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:30,178
Tag! You're it!

113
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:32,514
Tag!

114
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:34,519
Missed me!

115
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,156
No, you're it!

116
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:38,783
Tag!

117
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:40,758
I'm it?.

118
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,363
Tag!

119
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:44,693
Tag! Got you!

120
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:49,033
-Got you!
-Missed me!

121
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,907
Girls, no! Wait!

122
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:33,013
Can't catch me!

123
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:46,490
Oh, no!

124
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:43,081
Subway, huh?.

125
00:14:56,165 --> 00:14:57,860
Tag. You're it.

126
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:05,796
There they--

127
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:11,543
Here she comes!

128
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:44,569
Suckers.

129
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:48,343
Tag. You're it.

130
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:51,509
You know, I've got a nice car.

131
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:58,356
-You're it.
-No, you're it!

132
00:15:58,527 --> 00:15:59,516
Hey!

133
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,763
She'll never find us up here.

134
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:12,606
Do you hear something?.

135
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:17,369
Run!

136
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:19,444
Tag! You're both it!

137
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:20,741
Hey!

138
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,977
-We can't both be it.
-Why not?.

139
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:27,122
-Tag.
-What?. I can't be it twice!

140
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,350
-Why not?.
-Okay then.

141
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:32,790
Tag. Now you guys are it.

142
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:34,293
-Tag.
-Tags.

143
00:16:34,463 --> 00:16:36,931
-Hey, no tag backs! Tag!
-Tag!

144
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:38,088
-Tag!
-Tag!

145
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,256
-Tag!
-Tag!

146
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:43,634
-Tag!
-Tag!

147
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:46,798
-You're it!
-You're it!

148
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:03,252
Oh, boy.

149
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:07,552
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

150
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,834
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

151
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:19,496
Oh, boy.

152
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:24,169
Mayor, the town is being destroyed
by three girls with freakish powers.

153
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:28,044
This is a very serious situation.
What action should we take?.

154
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:30,014
-Tag, tag!
-Tag, tag, tag!

155
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,055
Don't worry. We have the situation
under control.

156
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:36,020
-Oh, boy.
-I know, sir.

157
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:41,954
-Oh, boy.
-You tell them, Mayor.

158
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:44,258
Townsville will not stand for this.

159
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:51,231
Mayor?. Hello?.
City being destroyed?.

160
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:53,875
-Where are you going?.
-Oh, boy.

161
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:59,480
Mayor, where are you going?.
We're in a serious pickle.

162
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:01,115
Exactly.

163
00:18:02,118 --> 00:18:03,779
Girls, no!

164
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:06,879
Hello.

165
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:09,650
Hello.

166
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:11,554
The usual, Cucor.

167
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:18,692
I have a fine vintage for you here.
Picked fresh today.

168
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:21,326
Oh, boy!

169
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:45,988
Girls, girls, are you okay?.

170
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:49,859
Tag! You're it, Professor!

171
00:19:30,573 --> 00:19:36,034
Okay, girls. Girls, it's almost
bedtime, okay?. Girls?.

172
00:19:36,212 --> 00:19:39,238
Come on, Professor, you're it.
You gotta catch us.

173
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:42,040
Yes, I suppose I do, don't l?.

174
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,517
Got you, you little bunny.

175
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,322
Help! I got caughted!
Blossom, watch out!

176
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:56,988
You're the sole survivor!

177
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,464
No way, Professor!
You can't catch me.

178
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:03,799
Yes, I can because the game's over,
and it's your bedtime.

179
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:06,908
Now come up here so we can catch you.

180
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:17,484
Well now, three little girls had
a very busy day today, didn't they?.

181
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:20,481
Yeah, it was fun.
We met lots of kids.

182
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:23,921
-And we learned things.
-And we played tag!

183
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:28,496
I'm glad you had so much fun
because tomorrow will be busy too.

184
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:33,499
Put your nighties on and get in bed.
We need to talk about something.

185
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:36,866
-Okay, everybody in?.
-Yep, what's up, Daddy-o?.

186
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,599
Well, it's your super powers.

187
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:42,005
I'm not sure how to say this...

188
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:45,272
...but I don't think you should
use them in public anymore.

189
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:46,776
Why?.

190
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:50,315
Well, your powers
are very special and unique...

191
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:54,115
...and although we have a lot of fun
doing things in the house...

192
00:20:54,290 --> 00:21:00,251
...out in Townsville, people don't
understand how special you girls are.

193
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:04,024
And unfortunately, people
often get scared or angry...

194
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,294
...when they don't understand
something special or unique.

195
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:08,663
That's silly.

196
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:14,605
I think so too, but nonetheless, take
it easy with the powers tomorrow.

197
00:21:14,777 --> 00:21:18,941
Just give Townsville a little time
to understand your specialness, okay?.

198
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:20,103
-Okay.
-Okay.

199
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:23,308
-Yeah.
-People are nice. Things will be fine.

200
00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:50,236
So I'll be waiting here to pick you up
when school gets out, okay?.

201
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:54,644
Okay, but don't worry, Professor.
Things are gonna be fine.

202
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,653
Girls, we didn't know
if you'd be joining us today.

203
00:22:05,227 --> 00:22:07,957
Take your seats.

204
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:15,102
I'm sorry to say there won't be
any recess for a while...

205
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:17,899
...due to all the reconstruction.

206
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:23,739
Secondly, I'm afraid we won't have
any lights or water for a while.

207
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:27,848
And a broken refrigerator
means snack-time is out...

208
00:22:28,017 --> 00:22:32,454
...so let's try to ignore
all the workmen and noise and such...

209
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:35,613
...and get right to work, shall we?.

210
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:40,023
Girls, can you recite
the alphabet for us?.

211
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:47,802
Girls?. ABCs?.

212
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:53,464
A, B, C, D.... E!

213
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:56,702
Hey, galldang it!
You done darn broke my board.

214
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:58,904
Flamdanggling consarglers.

215
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:00,878
F....

216
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:07,912
Almost time to pick up the girls.

217
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,079
Better motor.

218
00:23:10,492 --> 00:23:12,289
That's him, boys!

219
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:16,227
He's in cahoots
with the evil pickle-cart killers...

220
00:23:16,398 --> 00:23:20,232
...cucumber crushers,
vinegar varlets, dill-stroyers!

221
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:22,393
Why, it's not kosher! It's--

222
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:25,005
Let it go, Mayor. Let it go.

223
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:29,436
-Are these your babies?.
-Yes, but they were just playing.

224
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:34,275
They're really very good little girls.
And I need to pick them up from school.

225
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,384
I understand, sir...

226
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:41,455
...but we want you to come downtown
with us to ask you a few questions.

227
00:23:42,424 --> 00:23:46,224
You guys, my kids.
I really ought to pick them up.

228
00:23:46,862 --> 00:23:48,853
I can't just leave them there...

229
00:23:49,031 --> 00:23:51,090
...alone.

230
00:24:09,585 --> 00:24:14,420
He's not coming. He hates us.
He totally hates us.

231
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,489
No, he probably just got held up,
or maybe the car broke...

232
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,958
...or maybe he forgot...

233
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,462
...or maybe he hates us.

234
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:28,497
Come on, let's try
and find our way home.

235
00:24:30,873 --> 00:24:34,206
We're not supposed to use our powers.

236
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:37,875
Come on, girls.

237
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:53,125
The cause?
Three super powered little girls.

238
00:24:53,295 --> 00:24:56,321
Should manufacturing
super powered children be illegal?

239
00:24:56,498 --> 00:24:59,934
A great travesty has befallen
our beloved city.

240
00:25:00,102 --> 00:25:05,404
I was easing the seat back when this
atomic punk flies in with no warning.

241
00:25:05,574 --> 00:25:08,065
The devastation? Devastating.

242
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,675
It should be illegal.

243
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:12,837
Used to be a time when
you could buy an honest pickle.

244
00:25:13,015 --> 00:25:15,506
They were lighting up the sky.

245
00:25:15,684 --> 00:25:20,348
Estimated dollars in damages?
A whopping 25 million.

246
00:25:20,522 --> 00:25:22,387
I'm offended just looking at them.

247
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,052
The kind that you can only find
at a pickle cart.

248
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:29,627
Now Jamie's crying.

249
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:33,495
-Well, it seems that--
-Hatred is running rampant for--

250
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:37,230
-Those mutant, bug-eyed--
-Pickle-cart killing--

251
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:39,306
Freaks. Back to you, Linda.

252
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:43,568
They are little freaks, aren 't they?
With more on this subject is--

253
00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:54,782
Get them out. We don't need them.
We don't need them.

254
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:06,265
We interrupt this program
for a news flash.

255
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:09,029
Arrested in connection
with the tag incident...

256
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:13,800
...was the scientist responsible for
creating the girls, Professor Utonium.

257
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:17,309
Upon incarceration,
the Professor made this statement:

258
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:21,540
Please, just let me go.
My girls, they need me.

259
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:24,575
They don't know I'm in jail.

260
00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:29,648
What if they try
to go home themselves?

261
00:26:31,793 --> 00:26:35,251
They can't find their way
if they don't fly.

262
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:42,993
Please, they're only little girls
who are probably cold, scared...

263
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:47,005
...and maybe even lost.

264
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:56,448
Well, it' s official.
I have no idea where we are.

265
00:26:56,618 --> 00:26:59,644
Well, I can't say
it's been the best day.

266
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:03,757
But it probably couldn't
get much worse.

267
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:13,531
Hey, it's okay. Maybe there's
a box we can get in around back.

268
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:15,293
Come on.

269
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:23,672
See, there's a whole bunch of boxes.

270
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:43,225
What's the matter?.

271
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:46,663
Did somebody get lost?.

272
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:23,665
Wow, thanks!

273
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,103
Hey, wait! Come back.

274
00:28:39,187 --> 00:28:40,814
Hey, guys, over here.

275
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:44,288
-Hi. What's your name?. I'm Blossom.
-Buttercup.

276
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,984
And I'm Bubbles.

277
00:28:47,162 --> 00:28:51,292
Go away, please. Do not look at me.

278
00:28:51,466 --> 00:28:54,993
We just wanted to thank you
for saving us from those gangsters.

279
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,832
That was amazing
with the trashcan lid.

280
00:28:58,006 --> 00:29:00,907
It was all: swoosh, bang,
splash, bam, boom.

281
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:02,304
Yeah, you rock.

282
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:07,306
No, please. I dare not listen...

283
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:12,215
...for I have been lashed
by harsh tongues for too long.

284
00:29:12,387 --> 00:29:16,721
Alas, my little ones, I do not rock.

285
00:29:16,892 --> 00:29:21,852
For l, Jojo, am a monster.

286
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:27,193
You're not a monster.
Monsters are evil.

287
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:30,600
Anybody who would save us
like you did is so not evil.

288
00:29:30,772 --> 00:29:34,003
You're no monster, mister.
You're just really dirty.

289
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:38,070
Please. You're just trying
to make me feel better.

290
00:29:38,246 --> 00:29:42,444
But my pain is not for you
to understand.

291
00:29:42,651 --> 00:29:44,050
Besides, how could you?.

292
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:50,715
For you are pure and innocent
and, most certainly, loved.

293
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:54,225
How could you know what it is
to be cast out...

294
00:29:54,396 --> 00:29:58,958
...into a world
that only offers misery?.

295
00:29:59,134 --> 00:30:03,798
How could you know what it's like
for people to fear and despise you...

296
00:30:03,972 --> 00:30:06,668
...for the very things
that make you special...

297
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:10,402
...because you don't fit in,
because you are...

298
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:12,740
...a freak?.!

299
00:30:15,717 --> 00:30:17,116
Because...

300
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:21,048
...we're freaks too.

301
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,550
-What amazing powers!
-No, they're terrible.

302
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:27,524
-I bet everyone hates them.
-Yeah.

303
00:30:27,696 --> 00:30:31,188
-And they hate you too.
-Yes.

304
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:35,569
I am in the same boat.

305
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:40,504
This brain is full of brilliant ideas.

306
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:45,044
But will anyone listen?. No.

307
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:48,410
Nothing in this gray matters.

308
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:51,017
So, what's the point?.

309
00:30:55,657 --> 00:30:58,626
Jojo, don't be sad.

310
00:30:58,794 --> 00:31:02,662
Our dad says people get angry
when they don't understand...

311
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:04,662
...something special or unique.

312
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:09,099
If you just give people time, they'll
start to understand your specialness.

313
00:31:09,271 --> 00:31:12,297
Yeah. You just gotta believe
in yourself.

314
00:31:12,474 --> 00:31:16,843
If I construct my Help-the-town-
and-make-it-a-better-place machine...

315
00:31:17,012 --> 00:31:20,209
...people will come to understand
my specialness?.

316
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:22,845
I'll do it,
but I'll need your help.

317
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:27,284
Jump in, take this device
into the volcano.

318
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:30,515
We need to harness the energy
of the Earth's core for power.

319
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:32,557
-What are you talking about?.
-The plan.

320
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:34,251
-What plan?.
-Our plan.

321
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:36,761
-To do what?.
-To make the town better.

322
00:31:36,932 --> 00:31:38,399
-What?.
-You know.

323
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:42,594
We will build the Help-the-town-
and-make-it-a-better-place machine.

324
00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:47,003
Everyone will see our special
abilities are good. They will love us.

325
00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:49,200
Remember?. It was your idea.

326
00:31:50,011 --> 00:31:52,946
Oh, yeah. But use our powers?.

327
00:31:53,114 --> 00:31:54,877
-Yes.
-No way.

328
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,041
-Come on.
-No.

329
00:31:57,219 --> 00:32:00,245
We're never using our powers again.

330
00:32:00,422 --> 00:32:03,152
Girls, don't be sad.

331
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:08,456
Your powers are great.
You just gotta believe in yourself.

332
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,260
Yes! Yes! Yes!

333
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:50,803
-We did good?.
-You did very good. Very good indeed.

334
00:32:50,972 --> 00:32:54,408
-Now what do we do?.
-We construct the superstructure.

335
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:02,700
Look. Can't you see
our plan is working?.

336
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:07,712
Our work is proceeding as planned.
At last, our lives will be better.

337
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:10,609
At last, we will be accepted.

338
00:34:10,785 --> 00:34:14,744
At last, our greatest work is comple--

339
00:34:15,323 --> 00:34:16,915
-Oops.
-What's wrong?.

340
00:34:17,092 --> 00:34:18,753
Well...

341
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:24,524
...there is one last teeny-tiny,
itsy-bitsy thing we still need.

342
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:42,643
Yes! Yes! Yes!

343
00:34:42,817 --> 00:34:48,119
-We did good?.
-You did very good. Very good indeed.

344
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:49,688
Now what do we do?.

345
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:53,123
Well, because you've done so good...

346
00:34:53,294 --> 00:34:56,855
...I've got a special surprise.

347
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:16,473
-Worthless.
-Lame.

348
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:18,669
-Stupid.
-Okay.

349
00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:21,008
-Better.
-Almost.

350
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:23,506
Awesome!

351
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:46,031
Come, girls, our work is fin--

352
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:48,606
I mean, time to go.

353
00:36:50,278 --> 00:36:51,609
But, Jojo....

354
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:54,373
-We haven't seen the gazelles.
-Or the crocodiles.

355
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:58,576
Or the unicorns. Just one unic--

356
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:06,493
Excuse me, ma'am.
I think you dropped this.

357
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:13,364
I thought the zoo kept
all the animals in cages.

358
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:15,696
Yeah, well, you're welcome, lady.

359
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,531
Don't listen, Bubbles.

360
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:20,503
That's right, Bubbles, do not listen.

361
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:24,372
All of you, deafen yourselves
to their heartless words.

362
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:28,539
They do not know it is their saviors
they are speaking to.

363
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:33,585
They are unaware your actions will
have helped change their world forever.

364
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:39,716
Because we have helped the town
and made it a better place.

365
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:42,886
-You think they'll be surprised?.
-Oh, yeah.

366
00:37:43,064 --> 00:37:45,862
Will they still be mad at us
for playing tag?.

367
00:37:46,034 --> 00:37:49,731
No, they'll have forgotten
all about that.

368
00:37:49,904 --> 00:37:51,929
Will they love us?.

369
00:37:53,274 --> 00:37:54,366
Yes.

370
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:58,603
-Really?.
-Would I lie to you?.

371
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,187
-I'm so excited!
-We'll show them!

372
00:38:07,355 --> 00:38:08,947
Hey, where's--?.

373
00:38:10,558 --> 00:38:12,287
Professor!

374
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:15,255
Girls, thank goodness you're okay.

375
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,457
I'm so sorry.
I'm a terrible, terrible parent.

376
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:24,001
You must hate me for not picking you
up from school, but it's not my fault.

377
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:27,005
It's this town. They've gone crazy.

378
00:38:27,175 --> 00:38:30,372
It's like they've never seen kids
playing before.

379
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:34,948
I knew your powers would take some
getting used to. But jail?. Lawsuits?.

380
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:37,710
Angry mobs?. What's next?.

381
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:42,322
Don't worry, Professor. Things are
gonna get better. We promise.

382
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:44,477
-Today's the day.
-Today's the day!

383
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:45,669
Today's the day!

384
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:47,337
-Today's--
-The day.

385
00:40:47,515 --> 00:40:49,449
-What to wear?.
-What to wear?.

386
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:50,641
That's nice.

387
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:13,139
Professor, wake up! Wake up.

388
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,832
-Wake--
-Up. Wake up, my brothers.

389
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,945
-Wake up and seize the--
-Day!

390
00:41:19,113 --> 00:41:21,479
-The day?.
-Yeah, the day when we--

391
00:41:21,649 --> 00:41:26,677
Show Townsville just what
our powers can really do.

392
00:41:27,688 --> 00:41:28,677
What?.

393
00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:32,189
We're gonna show Townsville
just what our powers can really do.

394
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,818
-We did something really good.
-That's gonna really--

395
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:37,931
Help!

396
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,292
Well, we met this guy.

397
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:42,197
With powers like us.

398
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,203
Who was also hated by everybody.

399
00:41:45,373 --> 00:41:48,308
But he had this great idea.

400
00:41:48,476 --> 00:41:50,808
To help the town.

401
00:41:50,978 --> 00:41:53,879
And make it a better place.

402
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:57,677
-That way the town would accept us.
-We did something to help.

403
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:02,455
So we used all our powers.

404
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,716
And abilities.

405
00:42:04,926 --> 00:42:07,417
And his ideas.

406
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:09,961
-To help everybody.
-City of Townsville...

407
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:13,726
-It's gonna be so cool.
-...I'd like to take this moment...

408
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:17,997
-You're gonna be so proud.
-...to thank the little people...

409
00:42:18,172 --> 00:42:19,730
Everyone's gonna love us.

410
00:42:19,907 --> 00:42:23,070
...who helped to make this day
a smashing success.

411
00:42:23,244 --> 00:42:25,678
We did really goo--

412
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:37,613
Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup,
I couldn't have done it without you.

413
00:42:40,127 --> 00:42:43,096
-It's their fault!
-I knew they were no good!

414
00:42:45,066 --> 00:42:46,124
What happened?.

415
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,734
This isn't making the town
a better place.

416
00:42:48,903 --> 00:42:53,465
Yes, it is, for me. The hobo
formerly known as "Jojo" is no more.

417
00:42:53,641 --> 00:42:56,371
From this day forward,
I shall be known as:

418
00:42:56,544 --> 00:42:59,570
Mojo Jojo!

419
00:43:02,817 --> 00:43:07,311
For too long, apes and monkeys
have been under the thumb of man.

420
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:10,924
Well, the time has come
to oppose that thumb...

421
00:43:11,092 --> 00:43:14,858
...and take hold
of what is rightfully ours:

422
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:17,020
The world!

423
00:43:17,198 --> 00:43:19,291
Professor, we didn't want this.

424
00:43:19,467 --> 00:43:20,729
-Liars.
-Fibbers.

425
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:22,460
You've doomed us all.

426
00:43:22,637 --> 00:43:24,366
Please, Professor.

427
00:43:24,906 --> 00:43:27,136
Please believe us.

428
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:33,604
I don't know who to believe.

429
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,775
I thought you were good.

430
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:39,476
No!

431
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,422
Yeah! All right!

432
00:43:45,593 --> 00:43:46,685
I rock!

433
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:48,886
I rock so hard.

434
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,963
For l, Mojo Jojo, have succeeded...

435
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:56,627
...in my first, greatest
and most brilliant plan ever.

436
00:43:56,837 --> 00:43:59,965
And l, Mojo Jojo, shall be...

437
00:44:00,408 --> 00:44:04,208
...king of the planet of the apes!

438
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,849
You shall be king?. Preposterous.

439
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:10,415
What?. How dare you.

440
00:44:10,585 --> 00:44:13,713
For it is I who is the one
most suited to be ruler.

441
00:44:13,888 --> 00:44:15,378
Those are my clothes.

442
00:44:15,556 --> 00:44:19,515
I, Ojo Tango, shall be simian supreme.

443
00:44:19,694 --> 00:44:21,355
No Ojo. Mojo.

444
00:44:21,529 --> 00:44:27,365
As I unleash the offensive omnipotence
of the oppressive Orango-tank.

445
00:44:27,535 --> 00:44:29,230
-Hold on.
-Oh, no!

446
00:44:29,403 --> 00:44:33,271
-I shall get a grip on the situation.
-You better not.

447
00:44:33,474 --> 00:44:37,968
As l, Rocko Socko,
seize control and rule.

448
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:40,303
-Wait!
-l, Baboon Kaboom...

449
00:44:40,481 --> 00:44:44,178
...with my Baboom-bot,
will be the bomb.

450
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,246
And if you don't like it...

451
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:51,555
...you can sniff my Baboom-bot bombs.

452
00:44:52,493 --> 00:44:53,585
That's classy.

453
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:56,161
Gangway! For we, the Gogo Po-Trol...

454
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:00,323
...form a chain of command
that will take hold of your world.

455
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:05,268
I, Hota Wata, am boiling mad,
for you are all wet behind the ears.

456
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:09,739
So I shall unleash a scalding torrent
to drown you out, for I don't give a--

457
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:10,899
Watch your mouth.

458
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:16,015
I, Cha-Ching Cha-Ching,
symbolize chaotic calamity.

459
00:45:16,183 --> 00:45:21,917
We, the Doot Da Doot Da Doo Doos,
shall rain on your parade because...

460
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:24,421
...we're the spit.

461
00:45:24,592 --> 00:45:27,527
My name is Hacha Chacha
And here is my schpiel

462
00:45:27,695 --> 00:45:30,357
A diabolical plan with lots of appeal

463
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:33,295
Spreading out bananas far and wide

464
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:36,561
And fixing up the folks
For a slippery slide

465
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:37,863
Pretty catchy.

466
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:42,738
I, Blah-Blah-Blah-Blah, shall create
a sauce of chaos and stir up trouble...

467
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,572
...with a destructive force
known as the tormato.

468
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:48,977
-Tormato?.
-Tormato.

469
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:52,879
-l, Killa Drilla.
-l, Bonzo Bango.

470
00:45:53,054 --> 00:45:54,453
-l, Rolo Ovo.
-l, Cruncha Muncha.

471
00:45:54,622 --> 00:45:56,556
-l, Wacko Smacko.
-l, Pappy Whappy.

472
00:46:02,163 --> 00:46:04,495
No!

473
00:46:04,665 --> 00:46:09,102
Do not continue with your ramblings.
Mine are the ramblings to be obeyed.

474
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,670
I am the king, supreme leader
and dictator.

475
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:17,835
Your plans are my plans because you
made plans and my plan was to make you.

476
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:21,573
I plan to rule the planet,
not to have my plans plan to stop me.

477
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:25,207
I am your creator, I am your king.

478
00:46:25,386 --> 00:46:31,154
I am Mojo Jojo. Obey me!

479
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:21,501
That jerk, that big, fat, dumb jerk.
He duped us.

480
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:24,473
He planned it all along,
and we fell for it.

481
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:30,878
And now, everybody hates us even more.

482
00:47:35,256 --> 00:47:37,224
What are you doing?.

483
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:41,020
What does it look like I'm doing?.

484
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:46,656
I'm building a house
because now we have to live here.

485
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:49,860
-Live here?.
-Yeah, don't you see?.

486
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:54,531
This can be the bedroom,
and this is my bed.

487
00:47:55,943 --> 00:47:58,707
That can be your bed over there.

488
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:03,407
I don't wanna sleep on a rock!

489
00:48:08,189 --> 00:48:11,955
Maybe if someone hadn't pushed
Bubbles into the school....

490
00:48:12,693 --> 00:48:14,684
Look, she speaks.

491
00:48:14,862 --> 00:48:18,298
Maybe if somebody hadn't insisted
on walking home...

492
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:22,333
...so we could run
into the biggest liar in the universe!

493
00:48:22,503 --> 00:48:25,995
We weren't allowed to use our powers,
and you know it!

494
00:48:26,173 --> 00:48:29,040
Look, it's Miss Goody-Goody.

495
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:33,647
We weren't gonna get people
to stop hating us by breaking rules.

496
00:48:33,814 --> 00:48:36,282
Yeah. And using our super powers...

497
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:39,908
...to make a Help-the-town-and-
make-it-a-better-place machine...

498
00:48:40,387 --> 00:48:42,582
...was following rules?.!

499
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:46,692
-I didn't see you putting up a fight.
-Well, you're gonna now.

500
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:51,788
If it weren't for you,
we wouldn't be in this stupid mess.

501
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:54,467
You stupid!

502
00:49:10,484 --> 00:49:13,544
I'm not fighting with you, Buttercup.

503
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:16,485
Because you know I'll kick your butt.

504
00:49:16,657 --> 00:49:20,423
No, because I know--
Never mind.

505
00:49:20,594 --> 00:49:24,724
I'm not fighting with you,
and I'm not talking to you ever!

506
00:49:25,366 --> 00:49:29,393
Well, prepare yourself
for a long silence, girl...

507
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:34,234
...because we're gonna spend the rest
of our lives here, thanks to you.

508
00:49:34,408 --> 00:49:37,571
At least I got me a bed.

509
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:17,510
Blossom?. Buttercup?.

510
00:50:18,886 --> 00:50:20,217
Do you hear that?.

511
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,552
No!

512
00:50:24,725 --> 00:50:27,523
Blossom, what should we do?.

513
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:39,196
Miss Goody-Goody'll say we should take
responsibility for our mistakes...

514
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:43,867
-...and go help everybody.
-lt sounds like they're hurting.

515
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:45,705
Who cares?.

516
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:54,020
-What do we do?.
-Nothing.

517
00:51:13,807 --> 00:51:15,536
-Girls!
-Professor!

518
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:19,774
Professor! Professor! Professor!

519
00:51:27,821 --> 00:51:29,413
Help!

520
00:51:30,057 --> 00:51:31,752
Bubbles, wait!

521
00:51:33,827 --> 00:51:37,558
-Good job, but we've gotta save--
-The baby!

522
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:40,625
Holy....

523
00:51:42,636 --> 00:51:44,536
-Hey, what about--?.
-The dog!

524
00:51:52,746 --> 00:51:55,306
-You'll be safe now.
-Here you go, miss.

525
00:51:55,482 --> 00:51:58,178
-Thank you.
-Come on, Bubbles, let's--

526
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,351
Save those people.

527
00:52:01,755 --> 00:52:04,053
Wait! This isn't my baby.

528
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:07,059
Good dog.

529
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:11,990
Can we find the Professor now, please?.

530
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:15,496
Oh, man!

531
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,242
Now stay!

532
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:44,219
Doggone it!

533
00:53:00,147 --> 00:53:02,240
Okay. You should be safe here.

534
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:04,008
This is hopeless!

535
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:09,281
I know. There's too many monkeys.
What can we do?.

536
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,490
Get your hands off him,
you darn dirty ape!

537
00:53:30,744 --> 00:53:35,181
I didn't mean it!
It was an accident!

538
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:40,013
He wouldn't let go!
And the dog.

539
00:53:40,187 --> 00:53:44,715
That stupid dog,
and then the monkeys, and he--

540
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:48,350
I couldn't-- He couldn't--
Oh, man!

541
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:52,260
Buttercup!
You're a genius!

542
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:55,794
-I am?.
-She is?.

543
00:53:55,969 --> 00:54:00,269
Yeah. The one way to stop the monkeys,
save the town and find the Professor...

544
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,341
...is to use our powers to--

545
00:54:04,645 --> 00:54:06,704
Better yet, watch!

546
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:21,191
-Wow!
-That was amaz-- Hey!

547
00:54:22,996 --> 00:54:25,226
Gross! Cut it out.

548
00:54:33,874 --> 00:54:38,402
Come on, girls. Let's put an end
to this gorilla warfare.

549
00:54:44,218 --> 00:54:46,277
Good one, Bubbles.

550
00:54:46,553 --> 00:54:49,317
-Girls--
-Shut up! I was afraid of this.

551
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:53,619
They've returned and found out
what their powers can really do.

552
00:54:53,794 --> 00:54:58,060
Come. You will make
a good "Power-proof" vest.

553
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:42,729
-None of those monkeys had Professor!
-Where could he be?.

554
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:45,599
Take a good guess!

555
00:56:52,946 --> 00:56:57,349
Come on, girls! We've got
one last monkey to get off our backs!

556
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:03,116
Not so fast...

557
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:05,053
...Mojo Jojo!

558
00:57:05,225 --> 00:57:10,128
Look at the little heroes
here to save their daddy!

559
00:57:10,297 --> 00:57:12,322
No, girls! Save yourselves!

560
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:16,060
-Sorry, Professor!
-We can take this chump chimp down!

561
00:57:16,236 --> 00:57:18,602
Nothing he can do can stop us!

562
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:21,207
That's better.

563
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:25,200
It's good you little freaks
know when you're beaten.

564
00:57:25,379 --> 00:57:29,713
Now if you'll excuse me, l, Mojo Jojo,
have a town to take over!

565
00:57:29,883 --> 00:57:33,375
I have a world to rule!
I have to seize control of an area...

566
00:57:33,553 --> 00:57:38,183
...and force its inhabitants
to follow my way of thinking!

567
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:50,668
Even if it means...

568
00:57:50,837 --> 00:57:54,295
...taking extreme measures!

569
00:57:55,242 --> 00:57:57,335
-You wouldn't!
-I would!

570
00:58:21,401 --> 00:58:22,834
Professor!

571
00:58:31,411 --> 00:58:36,280
Now I am more Mojo than before!

572
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:57,494
Now, as I was saying before
I was so rudely interrupted...

573
00:58:59,573 --> 00:59:03,100
...I, Mojo Jojo, have succeeded...

574
00:59:03,276 --> 00:59:09,738
...in my first, greatest
and most brilliant plan ever!

575
00:59:09,916 --> 00:59:14,216
And l, Mojo Jojo...

576
00:59:14,387 --> 00:59:17,845
...shall be king!

577
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:32,330
Girls, thank goodness you're okay.
Now let's get out of this town!

578
00:59:32,506 --> 00:59:35,532
-It's no use.
-We already tried running away.

579
00:59:35,709 --> 00:59:38,075
We have to fix the problem
we helped start.

580
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:41,612
You said to give everyone time
to understand our specialness.

581
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:46,445
Well, now it's time for everyone
to understand. Especially Mojo!

582
00:59:59,466 --> 01:00:02,526
Surrender now,
and we'll go easy on you!

583
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,535
Down here!

584
01:00:09,943 --> 01:00:14,607
Oh, my! You're actually
trying to stop me?.

585
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,443
That's so cute!

586
01:00:17,617 --> 01:00:19,744
-Try, nothing!
-We will stop you!

587
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,821
Who are you calling "cute"?.

588
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:27,820
Okay, let's play!

589
01:00:43,176 --> 01:00:44,200
Buttercup!

590
01:01:04,898 --> 01:01:09,096
-Good job, girls!
-That more Mojo is no more!

591
01:01:15,942 --> 01:01:17,409
Girls!

592
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:41,395
Somebody's mad.

593
01:01:45,238 --> 01:01:46,637
Look out!

594
01:01:57,283 --> 01:02:00,480
Oh, no, look!
Mojo's got Blossom pinned down!

595
01:02:00,654 --> 01:02:03,623
I have an idea. Come on!

596
01:02:12,532 --> 01:02:16,730
-Do you think he's finished?.
-No, but you are!

597
01:02:26,746 --> 01:02:31,240
Fools! You dare to challenge me?.

598
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:33,978
Attempt to defeat me?.

599
01:02:34,154 --> 01:02:37,612
Try to destroy me?.!

600
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:41,420
I, who saved you from certain death?.

601
01:02:41,594 --> 01:02:46,258
After all I've done for you,
you betray me?.

602
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:49,425
And why?. For them?.

603
01:02:49,969 --> 01:02:53,268
The ones who hated you....

604
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,034
Have forsaken you?.

605
01:02:57,877 --> 01:03:04,146
Can't you see?. None of them
will ever understand you as I can.

606
01:03:04,317 --> 01:03:10,586
For we are kindred spirits, whose
powers spring from the same source.

607
01:03:10,757 --> 01:03:15,490
So, girls, do not make me destroy you.

608
01:03:15,862 --> 01:03:20,196
For we are smarter, we are stronger!

609
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,530
We are invincible!
We have the power!

610
01:03:24,704 --> 01:03:27,229
We are superior to them!

611
01:03:27,407 --> 01:03:31,468
And we shall rule!

612
01:03:33,246 --> 01:03:38,616
All we have to do is work together.

613
01:03:38,818 --> 01:03:42,549
Girls, join me.

614
01:03:52,532 --> 01:03:53,931
No!

615
01:03:56,736 --> 01:04:01,571
We'd never join you,
and it's because we are stronger.

616
01:04:02,108 --> 01:04:06,909
-Because we are invincible.
-Because we have the power!

617
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,412
We have to protect them from you!

618
01:04:09,582 --> 01:04:13,678
-It's you who has to be feared.
-Because you are a monster!

619
01:04:13,853 --> 01:04:15,343
You are evil!

620
01:04:15,722 --> 01:04:18,350
And you are...

621
01:04:19,592 --> 01:04:21,492
...it!

622
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:26,764
Curses!

623
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:32,463
Girls, you were right!
We should stop Mojo, and I know how!

624
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:37,042
I whipped up an antidote to Chemical X!
It'll do away with his powers!

625
01:04:58,565 --> 01:05:04,128
I'm so sorry for doubting you. You are
good little girls, and I love you!

626
01:05:04,304 --> 01:05:05,931
We love you too!

627
01:05:06,105 --> 01:05:09,336
-And we're really sorry.
-We messed up really bad.

628
01:05:09,509 --> 01:05:12,910
-But we're ready, Professor.
-Ready?.

629
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:15,741
To take the Antidote X
to get rid of our powers.

630
01:05:15,915 --> 01:05:18,941
If it wasn't for them,
none of this would have happened.

631
01:05:19,118 --> 01:05:23,987
And maybe everyone would like us more
if we were just normal little girls.

632
01:05:24,157 --> 01:05:25,852
No!

633
01:05:30,463 --> 01:05:33,455
Don't do that...

634
01:05:33,633 --> 01:05:37,467
...because that was pretty cool,
with the....

635
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:40,730
Girls, I think what the Mayor
is trying to say is...

636
01:05:40,907 --> 01:05:43,102
...we're sorry, and thank you.

637
01:05:43,276 --> 01:05:46,541
Yes, that was super, just super!

638
01:05:46,713 --> 01:05:49,204
-Amazing!
-Fantastic!

639
01:05:49,382 --> 01:05:51,816
-Wonderful!
-Stupendous!

640
01:05:51,985 --> 01:05:53,509
You rock!

641
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,046
Thank you.

642
01:06:03,796 --> 01:06:07,197
That was awesome!
You were all flying and running!

643
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:11,531
And then, laser eyes!
Then, bam!

644
01:06:11,738 --> 01:06:17,199
And then-- And then, bam,
you punched that guy! Remember?.

645
01:06:19,712 --> 01:06:25,309
Yeah, that was great.
You know, this town stinks.

646
01:06:25,518 --> 01:06:28,817
And I was wondering if,
maybe sometime...

647
01:06:28,988 --> 01:06:34,153
...we could, like, call you
to save the day or whatever.

648
01:06:34,327 --> 01:06:36,124
Can we, Professor?.

649
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:40,323
Well, I don't know....

650
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:44,525
Okay, but only if
it's before your bedtime.

651
01:07:01,854 --> 01:07:04,186
Help!

652
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:24,868
Sugar, spice and everything nice.

653
01:07:25,378 --> 01:07:30,213
These were the ingredients chosen
to create the perfect little girl.

654
01:07:30,383 --> 01:07:34,945
But Professor Utonium accidentally
added an extra ingredient to the mix:

655
01:07:35,121 --> 01:07:36,452
Chemical X.

656
01:07:36,622 --> 01:07:41,116
Thus Blossom, Bubbles
and Buttercup were born!

657
01:07:41,294 --> 01:07:45,788
Using their ultra super powers,
they've dedicated their lives...

658
01:07:45,965 --> 01:07:50,061
...to fighting crime
and the forces of evil.

659
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:00,709
And so for the very first time,
the day is saved, thanks to:

660
01:08:01,447 --> 01:08:03,506
The Powerpuff Girls!

661
01:08:03,683 --> 01:08:08,279
Hey, that's a good name for them.
Powerpuff Girls, yeah!

662
01:08:08,454 --> 01:08:12,686
I like that. Wonder if they will.
I'll run it by them.

663
01:08:12,859 --> 01:08:15,191
Powerpuff Girls!

664
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:35,369
ENGLlSH

665
01:30:17,207 --> 01:30:21,166
What are these strange protrusions?.

666
01:30:21,378 --> 01:30:24,541
I must investigate immediately.

667
01:30:39,196 --> 01:30:42,324
Dee Dee, too much has happened
this morning, so please...

668
01:30:42,499 --> 01:30:44,967
...get out of my laboratory!

669
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:48,536
I have no time for her foolishness.

670
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:52,506
But, Dexter, I'm not in your labo--

671
01:31:00,017 --> 01:31:04,147
-You've got chickenpox!
-Chickenpox?.

672
01:31:04,321 --> 01:31:06,812
What is this "pox of a chicken"?.

673
01:31:07,491 --> 01:31:11,427
Poor Dexter.
So knowledgeable in science...

674
01:31:11,595 --> 01:31:17,033
...but doesn't have enough common
sense to know what chickenpox is.

675
01:31:18,068 --> 01:31:21,162
Well, a long time ago...

676
01:31:21,805 --> 01:31:26,936
...a group of evil, contaminated
chickens escaped from jail...

677
01:31:28,612 --> 01:31:32,605
...and started to break
into children's houses...

678
01:31:32,783 --> 01:31:36,446
...where they pecked away,
leaving huge, itchy pimples!

679
01:31:37,421 --> 01:31:42,586
And if you scratch them, you'll turn
into an evil, contaminated chicken!

680
01:31:43,827 --> 01:31:46,227
Are you crazy, woman?.!

681
01:31:54,438 --> 01:31:58,397
I do not want to be an evil,
contaminated chicken!

682
01:31:58,575 --> 01:32:00,702
Then don't scratch!

683
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:06,516
That seems simple enough.

684
01:32:08,419 --> 01:32:12,082
I better keep myself busy,
so as not to think about the itching.

685
01:32:15,626 --> 01:32:16,923
Perfect!

686
01:32:17,094 --> 01:32:21,497
Now, how much
dioxide detrolium should I add?.

687
01:32:21,665 --> 01:32:24,862
What is the correct amount?.

688
01:32:28,539 --> 01:32:33,101
Silly me, have I been scratching
this whole time?.

689
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,980
Robot!

690
01:32:38,148 --> 01:32:40,708
More drastic measures must be taken.

691
01:32:40,884 --> 01:32:41,942
Yes, Dexter?.

692
01:32:42,119 --> 01:32:45,282
If you see me scratch
any part of my body...

693
01:32:45,456 --> 01:32:48,323
...zap me with 1 00 watts of electrons.

694
01:32:48,492 --> 01:32:50,551
Yes, Dexter.

695
01:32:52,463 --> 01:32:56,456
-I wasn't ready, Robot.
-Yes, Dexter.

696
01:32:58,802 --> 01:33:03,136
-I said, I wasn't ready.
-Yes, Dexter.

697
01:33:03,974 --> 01:33:06,272
No, Robot, wait!

698
01:33:07,744 --> 01:33:09,336
This is not working.

699
01:33:09,613 --> 01:33:11,547
Stop, Robot!

700
01:33:12,916 --> 01:33:15,851
A new invention must be created.

701
01:33:32,402 --> 01:33:34,597
Success!

702
01:34:20,784 --> 01:34:23,446
Got to scratch!

703
01:34:29,726 --> 01:34:32,092
Oh, yeah!

704
01:35:08,165 --> 01:35:09,723
Hello!

705
01:35:13,503 --> 01:35:15,562
Dexter, is that you?.

706
01:35:16,773 --> 01:35:19,640
Yeah. I scratched.
