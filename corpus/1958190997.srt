00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:53,120
- Dear Lord...

2
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:55,555
thank You for the opportunity
to come before You

3
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,092
in Your holy presence
here today.

00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:02,930
I hope to glorify You
in all I do.

Let it not be me they see.

00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,937
Let it be You.

7
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:13,707
I want to reflect
Your Holiness.

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,509
Come into this space
and fill it with Your spirit.

9
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:20,780
We want to be moved by You,
be glorified and honored.

00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,381
- With Pastor Taylor.

00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,250
I bet Ben Taylor is going
to ask to court you.

28
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,319
- No, Dad's just talking
to him about being an elder.

29
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:09,390
- Jem.

30
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,004
- Hey, Jem.

00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,206
- Hi.

32
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,840
- Ben was just saying

33
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,741
how much he enjoyed
y'all's performance.

34
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,244
Isn't that right, Ben?

- Yeah.

00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,680
- Thank you.

37
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,983
- Um, Ben, maybe you could
teach Jem and her siblings

38
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,184
how to fish.

39
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:38,185
- Oh, yeah, Ben loves fishing.

40
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,920
- I know how to fish.

41
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:42,722

to catch your eldest tonight.

42
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,391
We haven't seen him
since his return.

00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,861

Mrs. Stone here noticed that

50
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:03,043
the bra that you chose
is visible through your dress.

51
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,278

00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:07,814

00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,757

but sometimes things slip.

00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,271
- I don't know.

71
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,275

Hey, Misty.

00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,003
- Hey, welcome home.

95
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,213
- How about your purse?
You've got your purse?

96
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,415

Thanks, Dad.

97
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,617
- Thank you for helping, girl.

98
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,419
- Good to see y'all.
- You, too.

99
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,589
- She's an angel.
- Oh, sure.

100
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,257
- Pastor says
Owen's already talking

101
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,359
about another missionary trip.
Another one.

102
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:14,428
- Wow, yeah, he's doing
God's work all over the place.

103
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:15,596
- And he's 28.

104
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,297
They should have
a family by now.

105
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,066

Alright?

122
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,211
Edmond--Edmond is here today,

123
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,547
and he has something he wants
to talk to y'all about.

124
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,382
He has a few words.

125
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,185
Let's listen.

126
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,686
- He's back
from King's Valley.

127
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,421
- What's King's Valley?

128
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:17,558
- It's this kind of camp
where the Lord works on you.

129
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:18,625
- Yeah, where you do
hard labor

130
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,626
and sleep in the dirt.

131
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,094
- Hey.

132
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:28,101
- T--today, I speak to you all
a cleansed man.

133
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:31,505
A few months ago,
I turned away from God.

134
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:40,280
I now know how lost I was,
and I reject that sinful life.

135
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:43,617
I ask God for His forgiveness
and for yours.

136
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:50,157
May I be pliable clay
in the potter's hand...

137
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,229
And permit You
to shape me into the person

138
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,997
that You would have me be.

139
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,101
- Amen.
- Amen.

140
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,441
- I just can't believe
Edmond's back.

141
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,176
Do you know what he did?

142
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,178
- He was watching porn
on Dad's computer.

143
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,447
- Watching what?

144
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,715
- He's all quiet now.

145
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,750
- Yeah, well, he got whupped
real good there.

146
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,585
I mean, did you see his hand?

147
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,821
- That's why you got to be
so careful with technology.

148
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,657
It's the easiest way
for Satan to reach you.

149
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,192
- Plenty of easier ways.

150
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,061
Hi, guys.

151
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,063
Real happy to see y'all.

152
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:33,100
Hopefully, you won't miss
my dad too much.

153
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,401
- How was Puerto Rico?
- Hey, bro.

154
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,203
- Yeah, how was it
being gone for so long?

155
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,638
- Oh, man.

156
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:38,705
It was incredible.

157
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,240
Yeah, it's beautiful,

158
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:42,376
and the people from my church
were all amazing.

159
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,177
Got real into farming.

160
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,712
Got myself
a little green thumb.

161
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,518
So...

162
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:55,222
some parts of service
were a little intense, huh?

163
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,723
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

164
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,593
What I ask of you guys
is that...

165
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,162
we don't judge him
too harshly.

166
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,397
Because all of us
have done things

167
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,098
that we're ashamed of, right?

168
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,702
I had--

169
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:12,406
I had a plan for today,
but I'm thinking, let's, uh--

170
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,875
maybe we should change it up.

171
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:17,544
Let's all stand.

172
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:19,880
And let's get on the ground.

173
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:21,882
Move the chairs to the wall.

174
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,320
- What's with him?
- I don't know. Let's see.

175
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,222
- Can you spit that out,
please?

176
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,126
Alright.

177
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,796
Find a little special space
for yourself on the ground.

178
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,398
Everyone, lay down.

179
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,169
Get down on the ground.

180
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,370
There we go.

181
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,672
It's just--
it's just linoleum tiles.

182
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:51,144
Lie all way down.

183
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,914
Yep, just like you're in bed
sleeping.

184
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:54,815
There we go.

185
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,216
All the way.

186
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,686
There we go.
Yep.

187
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,725
Eyes closed.

188
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,593
And put your hands
on your belly.

189
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,699
Just feel the ground
underneath you,

190
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,368
holding you up.

191
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,741
- Do you want us to pray?

192
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,244
- If you want.

193
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:28,315
We all share this ground
that God gave us.

194
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,517
God is giving us
the gift of others

195
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,653
who can share our burdens

196
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,922
and whose burdens we share.

197
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,593
- What was that?

198
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,561
- I don't know, but
Puerto Rico made him weird.

199
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,930
- Remember when you
said if you were a boy,

200
00:12:42,964 --> 00:12:44,498
you wanted to look like Owen?

201
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,333
- Becca.
- What? You said it.

202
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,272
- No dance troupe this week.

203
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,941
- Yeah, I heard
she had the baby.

204
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:56,877
- No, Mrs. Baker decided she
can't do it anymore at all.

205
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:58,545
- Wait, really?

206
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,414
So it's just no more?

207
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,815
- We don't know.

208
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,251
- Why don't we just find
someone else to teach it?

209
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,753
- Y'all, my mom said Owen's
in charge of church programs.

210
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,755
Maybe we could just ask him
if we could still do it.

211
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,657
- Oh, man, yeah!
Let's.

212
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:12,325
- I think Kelsey
should choreograph.

213
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,527
- Oh, no.

214
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,796
- You should!
You'd be good at it.

215
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,331
- You think so?
- Yeah.

216
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:06,379
- Hey.

217
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,781
- Hey, what's up?

218
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,751
- Hey, I was just delivering
some eggs to Mr. Garson.

219
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,886
I guess I got turned around.

220
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,688
- Three houses down that way.

221
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:15,990
- Right.

222
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,335
Heard you're in charge
of programs.

223
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,837
Some of us were thinking
we could maybe

224
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,674
still do the dance troupe
without Mrs. Baker.

225
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,310
- Yeah, I could try and find
someone else to teach it.

226
00:14:38,913 --> 00:14:41,448
- How long would that take?

227
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,917
- Uh, I don't know.

228
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,019
It ain't my expertise.

229
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,354
- It's just, we usually
do something for Labor Day,

230
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,025
so we need some time
to put it together.

231
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:54,461
- It'll happen
when it happens.

232
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,663
- Maybe we could
do it ourselves.

233
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,033
- I'm sorry.
My answer's no.

234
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:12,746
- I liked that thing we did
yesterday on the ground.

235
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:13,814
- Nice try.

236
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:19,020
- For real.
I...thought it was cool.

237
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:21,888
- Yeah, well, I reckon
I freaked everyone else out.

238
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:25,993
- Maybe.

239
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:28,361
- Yeah.

240
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,998
It was an exercise

241
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:33,100
one of the pastors
in Puerto Rico had us do,

242
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:36,003
but it doesn't translate here,
I guess.

243
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,342
- I don't know.
I like changing it up.

244
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,881
- Since the secret's out
with you.

245
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:49,649
My wife would kill me.

246
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,420
- What if we got one
of the older women

247
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,056
to sign off on everything?

248
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:58,059
Make sure the moves
are worshipful, God-focused?

249
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:00,827
- Uh...

250
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:03,597
bunch of teen girls coming up
with their own dance?

251
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,398
You know how much grief
I'd get?

252
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,601
- You'd freak everyone out.

253
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,674
Alright.
So who'd be in charge?

254
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:18,378
- Well, I've been
in the troupe for a while.

255
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,653
- Alright.
Yeah.

256
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,956
Your dad's got
to be cool with it.

257
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,024
Okay.

258
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,525
- Your shoe.

259
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,793
- Oh.

260
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:34,861
- Just--

261
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,500
Thanks.

262
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,784
- Sarah!

263
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,487
I'm in charge
of dance troupe.

264
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,689
Did you hear that?

265
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,791
Okay, fine!

266
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,463
- Wait, wait, stop! No, no!
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

267
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:43,763
Is he okay?

268
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,100
- Just leave him be.

269
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,137
- What happened?

270
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:53,074
- Someone he used
to play music with died.

271
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:56,110
Walt. They were real close.

272
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,644
- Never heard of him.

273
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,813
- Well, it's before your time.

274
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,816
Before I met your dad,
before he got clean.

275
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,522
- How'd he die?

276
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,891
- He, um...

277
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:13,027
took his own life.

278
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,128
He was a troubled man.

279
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,169
What's this I hear
about dance troupe?

280
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:25,672
- Oh.

281
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:29,642
Owen Taylor asked me
to be in charge of it.

282
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,012
- Huh.

283
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:32,779
- It's only 'cause
Mrs. Baker can't do it,

284
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:37,684
but he thinks
I'm kind of good at it, so...

285
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,853
- Is this for God
or for vanity?

286
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,156
- It's to praise God.

287
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,656
- Can't interfere
with home duties.

288
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,758
- It wouldn't.

289
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,563
- I'll talk to your dad.

290
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,238
- Y'all have fun today?
- Yeah, sure did.

291
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:34,808
- Kelsey, you're the
car pool queen today?

292
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,810
Alright, drive safe.
- Yep.

293
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:48,755
- How'd I do today?

294
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,890
- Slightly better.

295
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:54,761
Hey, um, I just realized
I have a flat tire,

296
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,198
and I was wondering
if I could get a ride.

297
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,767
- Yeah, sure.

298
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,903
- Thank you.
- I'll put the seat down.

299
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:07,908
- Oh, sorry.

300
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,944
It's for a Daniel fast.

301
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:13,746
You ever done one?

302
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,982
- No.

303
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:19,120
I like Mexican food too much.

304
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:21,754
- Mexican food.

305
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,092
Now I'm hungry.

306
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:39,772
- Is that Puerto Rico?

307
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,242
- Yeah.

308
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:45,112
Here, look.

309
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:49,250
At this beach,
you stick your head underwater

310
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:52,219
and you can hear the dolphins
clicking and whistling.

311
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:54,155
Wild.
- It looks fake.

312
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,323
- I know, right?

313
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:57,925
This is the, uh--

314
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,094
this is the church's farm,
which I managed.

315
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:08,903
Anyway.

316
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:13,474
- Why don't you go back?

317
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:15,943
- Not the time.

318
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,045
That and
Misty would wring my neck.

319
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,183
- You should start
a farm here.

320
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:23,951
- Hmm.

321
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:25,219
- I'm serious.

322
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:27,687
- Yeah, I bet you are.

323
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,997
So, uh,
any cool new dance ideas?

324
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:40,733
- Um, I don't know yet.

325
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,835
I want to do something cool
for Labor Day, but...

326
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,407
- You should look online
for inspiration.

327
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,076
There's tons of cool
worship dance videos.

328
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:50,477
- Yeah.

329
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,820
- Why were you
crying that night?

330
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,189
At the ball?

331
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,929
- I wasn't being mindful.

332
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,003
- Well.

333
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:17,304
I'm sure that ain't true.

334
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:25,745
Okay.

335
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:39,960
- Could you, um, show me
one of those dance videos?

336
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:44,064
- Uh, yeah, sure.

337
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,945
Wow.

338
00:22:57,978 --> 00:22:59,513
They look so good.

339
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,287
- Are you chewing gum?

340
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:10,424
- No.

341
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:14,094
- Spit it out.

342
00:23:26,974 --> 00:23:28,342
- Spit it out.

343
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:38,519
- Jem?

344
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:42,356
- I had a flat tire.

345
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:43,257
- Oh.

346
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:49,196
- Uh, I hope
you apologized for imposing.

347
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:51,332
- Oh, it's really no problem.

348
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:55,436
- Jem, inside.

349
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:56,937
Gotta give Becca
her history test.

350
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,439
- Thank you.

351
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:02,242
- Owen, say hi
to your mom for me.

352
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,510
- Yeah, will do.

353
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,452
- "Though I speak with the
tongues of men and of angels,

354
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:47,488
"but not love,

355
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:50,324
I've become a sounding brass
or a clanging cymbal."

356
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:55,629
- It means even if you have
the most beautiful gifts,

357
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,665
it doesn't matter if you
don't have love in your heart.

358
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:04,271
- Jem Starling.

359
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:07,074
Come here.

360
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:08,208
Please?

361
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:14,148
Sit.

362
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,354
- Something wrong?

363
00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:21,655
- No, no.

364
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,223
Uh...

365
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:28,529
- Ben Taylor asked your dad
about courting you.

366
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:32,366
- Oh.

367
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:36,503
- Dad prayed on it, and...

368
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:41,508
he feels that this is the path
God wants for us.

369
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,709
- Yeah.

370
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:44,978
He's leading you
to fulfill your purpose.

371
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:52,052
- We're so blessed to
bring our families together.

372
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:58,125
- I never really talk
to Ben.

373
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:01,361
- Well,
you'll get to know him.

374
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:07,267
- It's just before,
you said I didn't have to--

375
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:10,671
- I thought you were excited
to start down this path.

376
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:12,706
- I am.

377
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:17,478
I'm--I'm just surprised.

378
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:20,747
- Proverbs 3:5, "Trust in the
Lord with all thine heart."

379
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:28,388
- Um...

380
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:33,427
Can I pray on it?

381
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:38,532
I need to lie down.

382
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,740
- Alright, you guys!

383
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,510
We're going to meet back here
in an hour and 45 minutes!

384
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:51,345
Don't lose sight
of your buddy!

385
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:53,780
Buddy system works
for a reason!

386
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:55,449
What do you want to play, Ben?

387
00:27:05,492 --> 00:27:07,394
- Fuck you!

388
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,499
- Those are your--
those are your words, Misty.

389
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:15,802
Misty, I--I can't talk to you
right now, alright?

390
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:18,305
It's just feeling--
it's too loud in here.

391
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:20,173
I can't even hear you.

392
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:21,341
I'll call you later.

393
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:27,848
Eavesdropping, huh?

394
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:30,217
- I don't care about
your phone calls.

395
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:36,223
- Ooh, ooh!

396
00:27:36,256 --> 00:27:38,292
- Yeah!

397
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,494
- Here.

398
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,598
One, two--

399
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:46,199
- Hey!

400
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,502
- Alright, ball.

401
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:49,570
Oh!

402
00:27:49,603 --> 00:27:51,171
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me!

403
00:27:51,204 --> 00:27:52,806
Alright, well,
you're all warmed up already.

404
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,884
- Don't burn it.

405
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:06,720
- I like it burned.

406
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:23,637
Is this all the firewood
you got for the whole night?

407
00:28:25,238 --> 00:28:26,807
- Yeah.

408
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,276
- Okay.

409
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:31,144
We're gonna need a little
more wood than that.

410
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:32,379
Here.

411
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:40,687
- Gotta pee.

412
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,280
Need help?

413
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,450
- Sure.

414
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:17,290
- It's a fun night.

415
00:29:17,324 --> 00:29:18,792
- Yeah, I like
when church is like this,

416
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:20,894
not getting all hung up
on doctrine.

417
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:24,831
- Yeah, totally.

418
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:26,833
- Dancing is allowed, though.

419
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:30,938
You ever wanna be
a pro dancer?

420
00:29:30,972 --> 00:29:32,639
- No.

421
00:29:32,673 --> 00:29:34,307
- Why not?

422
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:37,344
That's the stick
you're gonna choose?

423
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:40,213
- I'm gonna have
to find a new helper.

424
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:46,553
- You know, the--

425
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:47,788
that's something
I struggle with.

426
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:51,993
Sometimes I worry I'm...

427
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:53,427
enjoying it too
much for myself

428
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,862
and like I'm doing it
for vanity

429
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:58,832
and not to praise Him.

430
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,434
- What, you think God
will strike you dead

431
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,769
if you're enjoying dancing?

432
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,671
- I mean...

433
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:07,841
- You're experiencing joy
in His creation, you know?

434
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:10,945
And that's--
that's honoring Him.

435
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:14,648
- Well, either way,
my mom would kill me.

436
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:18,518
And anybody can do what we do.

437
00:30:18,552 --> 00:30:20,353
I ain't like a real dancer.

438
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:21,989
- Yeah, right.
I've seen you.

439
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,791
Here.

440
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,996
Show me something.

441
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,933
- No.
- Come on.

442
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:34,501
If anybody can do it.

443
00:30:34,534 --> 00:30:35,502
- No.
- Come on.

444
00:30:35,535 --> 00:30:36,670
- I'm not--

445
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:38,839
- Got your own stage
right here.

446
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:41,508
- What?
- Come on.

447
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:44,878
I'm serious.
Put that wood down.

448
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:39,332
- Here, I'll take those.

449
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:45,973
Bug on you.

450
00:31:54,848 --> 00:31:58,652
Sorry. Uh...

451
00:31:58,685 --> 00:31:59,921
better get back.

452
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,472
- Anybody else want some?

453
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:56,776
- Hey.
How was it?

454
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,045
- It was good.

455
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:24,504
Lord, I come before you,
humbled and ashamed.

456
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:32,445
Satan tried to take a hold,
but I'm pushing him out.

457
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:39,452
I know I've given in
to lustful thoughts

458
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:45,159
and actions that take my focus
away from You and onto me.

459
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:47,194
I know that's wrong.

460
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:52,066
I'm going to keep
You at the center

461
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,800
of my thoughts and actions.

462
00:33:58,239 --> 00:34:00,573
Amen.

463
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:05,445
- Thank you, Jemima.

464
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:17,757
Courtship...

465
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:21,228
is a commitment made
for the purpose

466
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:23,596
of getting
to know each other better

467
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:27,567
and seeking God
with the aim of marriage.

468
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,940
Romans 12:13 says,
"Let love not be deceit.

469
00:34:32,974 --> 00:34:35,943
"Abhor all that that is sinful

470
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:38,079
and cleave
to that which is good."

471
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:49,991
- You ever think
about preaching?

472
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:53,526
- Mm.

473
00:34:57,564 --> 00:34:59,066
Maybe.

474
00:35:10,144 --> 00:35:14,681
- It's cool
that your brother...

475
00:35:14,714 --> 00:35:16,716
preached in another country.

476
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:24,225
It'd be cool to go to, like,
South America or something.

477
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:30,563
- Lotta rape there.

478
00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:35,702
- Oh.

479
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:05,132
- My friend Simon
has chickens.

480
00:36:09,136 --> 00:36:10,938
- One time, this one chicken
was like--

481
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:14,241
Just wouldn't stop pooping.

482
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:17,744
It was like this
brown and white,

483
00:36:17,777 --> 00:36:19,914
just kind of foamy liquid
kept coming out and coming out

484
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:20,948
everywhere it walked.

485
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:26,087
It was so funny.

486
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,256
And it got on all the
other chickens, too.

487
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,690
Want to barf.

488
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:37,630
- It was probably sick.

489
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:07,294
- ♪ I just know I was destined
to be something more ♪

490
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:12,032
♪ I was born
with an ace up my sleeve ♪

491
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:18,439
What do you want?

492
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:20,441
- Nothing.
- Oh. Hey, come on back.

493
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:22,209
Sorry, sorry.
Come on back.

494
00:37:22,243 --> 00:37:24,378
It's okay.
Come on.

495
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,781
Hey.

496
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:29,883
Sorry.

497
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:32,386
- What was that?

498
00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:37,124
- You don't recognize me?

499
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:39,326
- That was you?

500
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,394
- Mm.

501
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:46,666
- I didn't know
you played music like that.

502
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:52,006
- Yeah, yeah.

503
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,308
Played a little secular music.

504
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:56,177
It was a long, long time ago.

505
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:15,329
- With the man who died?

506
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:18,765
- Yeah, we used to write
some songs together.

507
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:27,141
You excited
about your courtship?

508
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:28,309
- Yeah.

509
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:35,182
- Yeah, right.

510
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:53,300
Do not tell your mama.

511
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:55,135
Shh.

512
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:12,852
- Hey, walk like a lady.

513
00:39:12,885 --> 00:39:15,322
You slump like your dad.

514
00:39:20,594 --> 00:39:22,396
- Is he bad again?

515
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:26,100
Mom.

516
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,935
- Sometimes Satan
tries to take hold.

517
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:29,403
He's okay.

518
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:32,506
- Are you going to tell
Pastor Taylor?

519
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,908
- Ah, that's murder.

520
00:39:36,377 --> 00:39:37,844
It's not like the last time.

521
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:39,913
He just needed to unwind.

522
00:39:41,348 --> 00:39:42,815
- But what--what if it--

523
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:44,351
- Look, he's fine.
Okay?

524
00:39:44,385 --> 00:39:46,186
I'm not dwelling on this
with you.

525
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,023
Got plenty of other things
to concern yourself with.

526
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:57,965
- ♪ Lord of Lords,
King of Kings ♪

527
00:39:57,998 --> 00:40:02,102
♪ My God, how can I have
no song but Thee? ♪

528
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:05,105
Oh.

529
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:06,507
- I'm sorry.
- I'll take this one.

530
00:40:11,645 --> 00:40:13,981
Here.

531
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:16,050
- Thank you.

532
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:19,286
- Such a nice service, right?

533
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,389
Giving you two ideas?

534
00:40:22,423 --> 00:40:24,058
Jem, we're so excited to hear

535
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:25,592
you're running
the dance troupe.

536
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:27,294
Can't wait to see what you're
going to do for Labor Day.

537
00:40:27,328 --> 00:40:29,930
- Yeah, it'll be good,
I think.

538
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:33,300
- Gosh, it's been so long
since I've seen a dance show.

539
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:35,269
- There's much dance
in Puerto Rico.

540
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:38,439
- When would I have seen it?

541
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,476
- Jem is lovely to watch.

542
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,011
- Thanks.

543
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:46,080
- Welcome.

544
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,314
- Hey, Owen.
- Yeah.

545
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:48,382
- Can I speak to you
for a sec?

546
00:40:48,415 --> 00:40:49,616
- Yeah.

547
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,186
- Oh, Jem,
you're a youth grouper--

548
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:54,922
you don't want to work
on some old farm, right?

549
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:56,423
- Um, I don't know.

550
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:57,925
- Oh, you see?

551
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,993
No need to get
all experimental.

552
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:01,628
Bible's enough.

553
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:04,531
Right?

554
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:08,068
"The book of the law shall not
depart out of thy mouth."

555
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:18,479
- ♪ Lord make me humble ♪

556
00:41:18,512 --> 00:41:22,049

565
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:52,079
- And that's all I got so far.

566
00:41:52,112 --> 00:41:53,547
- The spins look so pretty.

567
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,616
- Real honest,
ain't into the music.

568
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:57,718
- Yeah.
Is it a hymn?

569
00:41:57,751 --> 00:41:59,586
- It's a Christian song.

570
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,523
- Real intense drums.
- The elders won't like it.

571
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:06,160
- I just don't know why
she gets to choreograph.

572
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,694
- Really.

573
00:42:07,728 --> 00:42:10,297
- She was dancing?
- Did you see her spins?

574
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:31,685
- Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry.

575
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:32,753
- That's okay.

576
00:42:32,786 --> 00:42:34,455
- No, you don't have to--

577
00:42:34,488 --> 00:42:35,589
- No, it's okay.

578
00:42:35,622 --> 00:42:37,491
I've got to go home.

579
00:42:37,524 --> 00:42:39,259
- I was just grabbing food,
thought I heard something.

580
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:40,260
I didn't mean to spy.

581
00:42:40,294 --> 00:42:41,261
- No, it's okay.

582
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:42,596
- Do--do your thing.

583
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,267
Unless you want noodles.

584
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:49,069
- What?

585
00:42:49,102 --> 00:42:50,571
- You want noodles?

586
00:43:03,383 --> 00:43:05,085
- You're here late.

587
00:43:06,353 --> 00:43:08,088
- Congratulations
on your courtship.

588
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:10,457
- Thanks.

589
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:11,625
- How's dance?

590
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:14,695
- Fine.

591
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:17,264
Well, a lot of the girls
don't like my ideas.

592
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,535
Is that why you were praying?

593
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:25,138
Kidding.

594
00:43:25,172 --> 00:43:26,640
Who cares what they want,
you know?

595
00:43:26,673 --> 00:43:28,342
Just do your thing.

596
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,445
- I don't know.

597
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:36,116
- Sure you do.

598
00:43:38,218 --> 00:43:39,686
- Hot.

599
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,660
- You like seashells?

600
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,537
I was clearing this out today.

601
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,472
It's all years old.

602
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:05,646
Found these.
Thought they were pretty neat.

603
00:44:08,615 --> 00:44:10,617
- They're pretty.

604
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:12,586
- Well, lucky there's two.
You want 'em?

605
00:44:13,787 --> 00:44:15,222
- I'm not allowed.

606
00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:18,525
- Ah.

607
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,295
Guess they're all mine.

608
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:28,669
- Yeah.
I was praying about my dad.

609
00:44:28,702 --> 00:44:30,604
I think he's drinking again.

610
00:44:31,906 --> 00:44:34,308
- Mm.
What makes you think that?

611
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:36,710
'Cause I saw him.

612
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,085
- Does your mom know?

613
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:48,255
- Yeah.

614
00:44:48,288 --> 00:44:49,456
- But she acts like
she doesn't?

615
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:51,091
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

616
00:45:12,546 --> 00:45:15,215
Alright.

617
00:45:15,248 --> 00:45:16,783
I'm gonna do it.

618
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:17,851
- Mm-kay.

619
00:45:19,586 --> 00:45:20,821
- Ready?

620
00:45:24,257 --> 00:45:26,393
Ready...

621
00:45:26,426 --> 00:45:28,362
Three, two...

622
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:29,363
- Wait, don't.

623
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:30,564
- Don't?

624
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:31,565
- No.

625
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:32,599
- Yeah.

626
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:36,403
- I wanna do it.

627
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:37,771
- Yourself?

628
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:02,829
- Ah!

629
00:46:05,232 --> 00:46:07,200
- Are you okay?

630
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:10,337
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

631
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:11,605
Ah.

632
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:21,181
- Let me see.

633
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:25,719
Oh, man.
Yeah, you--

634
00:46:25,752 --> 00:46:27,521
You did really good.

635
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:29,856
Yeah.

636
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,426
Reckon you got to be good
about cleaning 'em.

637
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:33,794
- Mm.

638
00:47:10,031 --> 00:47:11,732
- Oh.

639
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:22,944
- It might be my mom.

640
00:47:25,779 --> 00:47:27,949
- Should I answer it?

641
00:47:33,087 --> 00:47:34,621
You okay?

642
00:47:36,823 --> 00:47:39,426
- Yeah.

643
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:40,827
I really should go.

644
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:43,396
She's going to kill me.

645
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,831
- Yeah.

646
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:46,399
You still got another ear.

647
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:49,669
- I know.

648
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:57,844
- You need a ride?

649
00:47:57,878 --> 00:48:00,781
No, I got the van.

650
00:48:14,594 --> 00:48:16,063
- No!

651
00:48:16,097 --> 00:48:17,731
- Can you tell me
the first ten books?

652
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:18,765
- Mom, when's dinner
gonna be ready?

653
00:48:18,799 --> 00:48:20,367
- I don't know.

654
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,735
Not happy with you.
- I'm sorry.

655
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:22,803
- She threw up.

656
00:48:22,836 --> 00:48:23,804
Can you please
give her a bath?

657
00:48:24,972 --> 00:48:27,374
- Okay, Jeremy,
I'm sorry, honey.

658
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:28,809
But unless you want
to go in your room,

659
00:48:28,842 --> 00:48:30,111
if you want to be
out here by the TV,

660
00:48:30,144 --> 00:48:31,812
then it's gonna be loud.

661
00:48:31,845 --> 00:48:32,879
- When is it ever
gonna be ready?

662
00:48:32,914 --> 00:48:34,648
- I have no idea, Rebecca.

663
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:35,715
Can you salt the water,
please?

664
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:39,786
- How many of y'all know

665
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,390
that if you met God
in the next 60 seconds,

666
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:44,791
that you'd be ready?

667
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:49,997
That you could say,
"I'm good, Pastor Taylor.

668
00:48:50,031 --> 00:48:53,400
I'm saved.
My sins are forgiven"?

669
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:55,002
Raise your hand up there.

670
00:48:55,036 --> 00:48:57,104
To the heavens.
Come on now.

671
00:48:57,138 --> 00:49:00,074
Now, those of you
who couldn't assuredly

672
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:03,010
raise your hand up,
you got some hesitations,

673
00:49:03,044 --> 00:49:05,445
some lingering doubts.

674
00:49:07,547 --> 00:49:12,053
Who'd say,
"If I died and met God,

675
00:49:12,086 --> 00:49:16,656
"I don't rightly know
if my sins would be forgiven,

676
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,960
but I know I don't want
to go to hell"?

677
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:24,131
I invite you to come up
to this altar for your sins

678
00:49:24,165 --> 00:49:25,899
and for your soul's salvation.

679
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:27,500
Please, come on up right now.

680
00:49:27,534 --> 00:49:29,971
Come on up, come on up.
It's a short walk.

681
00:49:30,004 --> 00:49:31,538
Jesus died on the cross
for you!

682
00:49:31,571 --> 00:49:33,607
Jesus! That's right!

683
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,443
That's right!
Here we go, here we go!

684
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:39,947
Praise God, praise Jesus!

685
00:49:39,981 --> 00:49:42,449
That's right. Strength of God.

686
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:46,954
- Round, duh, duh,
duh, duh, duh.

687
00:49:46,988 --> 00:49:50,057
Duh, duh, push and down.

688
00:49:50,091 --> 00:49:52,159
Step together.

689
00:49:52,193 --> 00:49:56,730
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

690
00:49:56,763 --> 00:49:57,831
That was good.

691
00:49:57,864 --> 00:49:59,100
That was great.

692
00:49:59,133 --> 00:50:01,902
- ♪ Fire in me ♪

693
00:50:01,936 --> 00:50:02,937
- Sorry.

694
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:06,173
Some costumes came.

695
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,574
I haven't opened it
up yet, but there

696
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:09,010
should be seven in there.

697
00:50:10,945 --> 00:50:12,046
- Thank you.

698
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,647
- It's looking great,
you guys.

699
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:05,232
- Hey.

700
00:51:05,266 --> 00:51:06,733
- Hi.

701
00:53:59,974 --> 00:54:02,809
- You took it out.

702
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:04,245
- It was getting infected.

703
00:54:27,234 --> 00:54:31,472
- Whoa, whoa, hey.

704
00:54:39,146 --> 00:54:40,981
Jem.

705
00:54:41,015 --> 00:54:41,982
What are you doing?

706
00:54:42,016 --> 00:54:45,085
- I'm hot.

707
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,321
- Jem!

708
00:54:47,354 --> 00:54:48,322
Hey!

709
00:54:48,355 --> 00:54:51,824
Jem.

710
00:54:51,858 --> 00:54:53,260
Jem.

711
00:54:53,294 --> 00:54:56,263
It's pitch-black!

712
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:59,732
Jem?

713
00:54:59,766 --> 00:55:03,003
Will you just talk
to me for a minute?

714
00:55:10,877 --> 00:55:12,079
- Jem.

715
00:55:14,281 --> 00:55:15,950
What's wrong?

716
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,155
Hey.

717
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:25,359
Hey.

718
00:55:25,392 --> 00:55:27,127
- Stop.

719
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:28,861
- Hey!

720
00:55:28,895 --> 00:55:29,862
- Stop!

721
00:55:31,465 --> 00:55:32,967
- Stop!
- Okay.

722
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,401
Hey, okay, okay!
- Stop!

723
00:55:34,435 --> 00:55:35,402
- Hey, you stop!

724
00:55:35,436 --> 00:55:37,204
You stop!

725
00:55:37,238 --> 00:55:38,906
I'm done if you're done.
- Stop!

726
00:55:38,939 --> 00:55:40,040
- Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

727
00:55:40,074 --> 00:55:41,041
Okay, okay.

728
00:55:41,075 --> 00:55:42,376
We're done.

729
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:43,776
Okay, okay.

730
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:45,980
Thank you.
- Stop.

731
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:47,147
- You got me.
- Stop.

732
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:50,985
- You got me.

733
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:52,286
You got me good.

734
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:02,129
- Do you think I'm wicked?

735
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:07,401
- No.

736
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:12,239
You're the furthest thing
from it.

737
00:56:12,273 --> 00:56:14,341
I'm sorry I got lost in it.

738
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:20,780
- I did, too.

739
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:30,190
Do you feel guilty?

740
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:35,195
- Uh... I mean, yeah.

741
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:36,497
I don't know.

742
00:56:40,401 --> 00:56:41,368
A lot before.

743
00:56:41,402 --> 00:56:42,802
Less now.

744
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:47,341
- Why?

745
00:56:47,374 --> 00:56:48,976
- I don't know.

746
00:56:49,009 --> 00:56:53,180
I've been praying on
it a lot, and I just--

747
00:56:53,213 --> 00:56:56,583
maybe I'm crazy, but it just--
it don't feel like a sin.

748
00:56:56,617 --> 00:56:59,353
Swear as the sky covers me,
it don't.

749
00:56:59,386 --> 00:57:03,490
- But you're--

750
00:57:03,524 --> 00:57:05,225
you're married.

751
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:08,228
- Yeah, and we can't
stand each other.

752
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:09,997
We can't.

753
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:15,402
I mean, she's all, like,
gossip and babies, and I'm--

754
00:57:15,436 --> 00:57:17,870
we ain't never felt
connected, ever.

755
00:57:17,905 --> 00:57:18,939
We misread the signs.

756
00:57:18,972 --> 00:57:20,441
I know it.

757
00:57:23,911 --> 00:57:28,148
But with you, I just--you
know, I see so much for you.

758
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:33,554
And when I'm with you,
I want so much for me, too.

759
00:57:33,587 --> 00:57:36,090
I ain't never felt
that with anybody.

760
00:57:39,326 --> 00:57:40,860
How could God not want that?

761
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:48,035
But if you want to stop,

762
00:57:48,068 --> 00:57:49,570
I more than get it,
completely.

763
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:51,171
Let's stop.

764
00:57:51,205 --> 00:57:53,340
- I don't.

765
00:57:53,374 --> 00:57:55,075
- It's really okay if you do.

766
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:00,114
- I--I feel it, too.

767
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:21,268
"Though I speak with the
tongues of men and of angels

768
00:58:21,301 --> 00:58:25,639
but have not love,
I am nothing."

769
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:34,047
Is it possible
to love too much?

770
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:42,022
All I feel is Your love, Lord.

771
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:52,199
The most beautiful gift
You've given to us,

772
00:58:52,232 --> 00:58:54,268
that draws us even
closer to You.

773
00:58:57,704 --> 00:58:59,706
So I want a heart full
of love.

774
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:05,579
I want it to fill me
to the brim.

775
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:38,345
- Hey, if there's anywhere
you could live,

776
00:59:38,378 --> 00:59:39,480
where would it be?

777
00:59:43,183 --> 00:59:44,318
Anywhere?

778
00:59:47,688 --> 00:59:49,523
- Mm.

779
00:59:49,556 --> 00:59:50,791
I'm not sure.

780
00:59:50,824 --> 00:59:52,493
- Come on.

781
00:59:52,526 --> 00:59:55,162
If you could go literally
anywhere in the world

782
00:59:55,195 --> 00:59:57,364
outside of Kentucky.

783
00:59:57,397 --> 00:59:59,366
- I'm not sure.
I don't know.

784
00:59:59,399 --> 01:00:01,568
- So what, are you just
going to stay here?

785
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:04,071
There's a whole lot more,
let me tell you.

786
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:07,608
- I like the skies
and the trees,

787
01:00:07,641 --> 01:00:10,677
and my dance troupe,

788
01:00:10,711 --> 01:00:12,446
and my siblings.

789
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:19,386
What?

790
01:00:19,419 --> 01:00:22,222
- You just don't know
what you're talking about.

791
01:00:38,605 --> 01:00:39,806
- Hey.

792
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:07,701
Did I wake you?

793
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:12,706
- Um, I was just
getting some water.

794
01:01:20,581 --> 01:01:23,116
You're a baby.

795
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,384
Come fly with me.

796
01:01:40,935 --> 01:01:42,803
- What was the name
of your band?

797
01:01:48,175 --> 01:01:50,577
- Deadbeats.

798
01:01:50,611 --> 01:01:51,612
- Were you famous?

799
01:01:54,748 --> 01:01:56,750
Mm, we got around.

800
01:01:58,785 --> 01:02:02,222
We had a record deal.

801
01:02:02,255 --> 01:02:05,258
We had a residency
at Arleen's.

802
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:06,293
- What's that?

803
01:02:06,326 --> 01:02:07,294
- Arleen's?

804
01:02:07,327 --> 01:02:09,396
In Memphis.

805
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:10,831
Everybody played there.

806
01:02:14,434 --> 01:02:15,937
You wouldn't know it
from seeing it,

807
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,771
but all kinds of legends
came through,

808
01:02:17,804 --> 01:02:19,439
and that was my favorite spot
to play.

809
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:24,511
- Why'd you leave?

810
01:02:24,544 --> 01:02:26,480
- After I got saved,
I didn't want

811
01:02:26,513 --> 01:02:28,682
to be selfish no more.

812
01:02:28,715 --> 01:02:30,751
Everything was always
about me,

813
01:02:30,784 --> 01:02:33,754
my songs, my struggles.

814
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:39,793
- Do you miss it?

815
01:02:50,704 --> 01:02:52,406
When God asks you
to give something up,

816
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:54,641
it's just so you got
more room for Him.

817
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:03,417
Go to sleep.

818
01:03:06,586 --> 01:03:07,922
- Oh--here, let me help you.

819
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:09,256
- I got it.

820
01:03:10,691 --> 01:03:12,259
- There you go.

821
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:14,428
There you go.

822
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:15,829
You okay?

823
01:03:15,862 --> 01:03:17,431
- Okay.

824
01:03:46,426 --> 01:03:47,929
- I don't get
a fancy touch one?

825
01:03:47,962 --> 01:03:48,996
- Mm-mm.

826
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,037
- Do you want to...

827
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:58,005
meet tonight?

828
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:00,574
- My parents are coming
over for dinner tonight,

829
01:04:00,607 --> 01:04:02,876
so probably not
the best night.

830
01:04:05,378 --> 01:04:07,014
It's okay.
Nobody died.

831
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,518
- Hey, y'all.

832
01:04:11,551 --> 01:04:13,653
- Hey.

833
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:15,388
Here you go.

834
01:04:15,422 --> 01:04:17,624
And you know how to put
those things of CDs in there.

835
01:04:17,657 --> 01:04:21,294
And, uh, yeah, Misty's
going to sit in on your, uh--

836
01:04:21,328 --> 01:04:22,429
your Labor Day choreography.

837
01:04:22,462 --> 01:04:23,697
- Sure am.
- Yup.

838
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,865
So.

839
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:26,633
- I can't wait.

840
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:29,636
- Yep.

841
01:04:29,669 --> 01:04:30,972
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

842
01:04:33,406 --> 01:04:35,042
- She's
just the sweetest girl.

843
01:04:35,076 --> 01:04:37,344
- I know.
She'll be good.

844
01:04:37,377 --> 01:04:39,947
- ♪ Fire in me ♪

845
01:04:39,981 --> 01:04:43,450
♪ You are the fire in me ♪

846
01:04:43,483 --> 01:04:46,586
♪ Heavenly Father ♪

847
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:50,457
♪ You are the fire in me ♪

848
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:53,293
♪ You are the fire in me ♪

849
01:04:57,697 --> 01:05:00,567
That was real nice, girls!

850
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,103
Thanks.

851
01:05:02,136 --> 01:05:04,038
So reckon there's just
a couple of things in there

852
01:05:04,071 --> 01:05:05,539
we got to correct.

853
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:06,573
- Really?

854
01:05:06,606 --> 01:05:08,875
- Yeah, just a few.

855
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:10,710
- Like what?

856
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:12,646
- Well, there are
some moves in there

857
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:14,648
where I'm worried
they focus a little too much

858
01:05:14,681 --> 01:05:16,117
on the individual.

859
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,618
So let's go through it
without music

860
01:05:18,652 --> 01:05:21,721
and make some adjustments.

861
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:25,759
- Okay, we'll just go
from the elbow bit.

862
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:31,598
Five, six, seven, eight.

863
01:05:31,631 --> 01:05:36,736
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

864
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,139
- Stop a sec.

865
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:39,639
I know you didn't mean

866
01:05:39,673 --> 01:05:41,408
to draw attention
to your legs.

867
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:43,945
Let's do the turn
without the leg, okay?

868
01:05:45,512 --> 01:05:48,582
Let's see it.

869
01:05:48,615 --> 01:05:51,018
- Okay, we'll just do
that turn bit

870
01:05:51,052 --> 01:05:53,020
and keep your leg in.

871
01:05:57,858 --> 01:06:00,760
Five, six, seven, eight.

872
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:06,700
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

873
01:06:06,733 --> 01:06:08,002
- Yeah.
Keep going.

874
01:06:08,035 --> 01:06:09,070
Keep going.

875
01:06:11,105 --> 01:06:17,544
- One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

876
01:06:17,577 --> 01:06:22,917
One, two, three, four,
five, six--

877
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:24,784
- And stop.

878
01:06:24,818 --> 01:06:27,121
Again, a little too
individual-focused.

879
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:28,488
Don't you think?

880
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:32,826
- Why?

881
01:06:32,859 --> 01:06:34,828
- Well, you're the only one
standing right now.

882
01:06:34,861 --> 01:06:36,463
All eyes are on you.

883
01:06:36,496 --> 01:06:38,065
- But my attention's to God.

884
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:39,699
- Yes.

885
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:41,468
But it almost looks
like all these girls

886
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:43,570
are worshipping you.

887
01:06:43,603 --> 01:06:44,972
- That's what I was saying.

888
01:06:45,006 --> 01:06:47,807
- I know that's not
what you were intending.

889
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:49,110
Of course.

890
01:06:49,143 --> 01:06:52,179
So let's make it
so everyone stands together.

891
01:06:52,213 --> 01:06:53,613
Okay?

892
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:57,985
What's the matter?

893
01:06:58,019 --> 01:07:00,054
- I just...

894
01:07:00,087 --> 01:07:01,655
we're praising God,
and if you take

895
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:02,856
this whole thing apart,

896
01:07:02,889 --> 01:07:04,691
you're just ruining
this worship.

897
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:09,796
- Listen.

898
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:11,765
I reckon you're
making this about you,

899
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:13,466
and it's not about that.

900
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,501
- She's used to being
Owen's favorite

901
01:07:14,534 --> 01:07:15,602
and doing what she wants.

902
01:07:15,635 --> 01:07:16,603
That's not true.

903
01:07:16,636 --> 01:07:17,604
- You got to choreograph.

904
01:07:17,637 --> 01:07:18,705
- We barely even talk.

905
01:07:18,738 --> 01:07:19,739
I'm just trying
to do a good job.

906
01:07:19,773 --> 01:07:22,609
- Alright.
Uh, Jem...

907
01:07:22,642 --> 01:07:25,012
Will you please just be
a grownup

908
01:07:25,046 --> 01:07:26,646
and work with me on this?

909
01:07:30,184 --> 01:07:31,685
- Okay.

910
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:33,988
I'll kneel down
like all of you guys.

911
01:07:34,021 --> 01:07:35,522
- Thank you.

912
01:07:35,555 --> 01:07:36,991
You can take it from the top.

913
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:14,095
- Girls, I'll be right back,
okay?

914
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:18,165
Paul, where have you been?

915
01:08:18,199 --> 01:08:19,899
- Hmm?

916
01:08:19,934 --> 01:08:22,136
- You got off work six
and a half hours ago.

917
01:08:22,169 --> 01:08:24,071
Five-hour-long way home?
- Uh-huh.

918
01:08:24,105 --> 01:08:25,672
- And you haven't been
answering your phone.

919
01:08:25,705 --> 01:08:27,008
- Frank let me go.
And it's--it's--

920
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:28,742
that we
just have to figure out.

921
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:30,177
- He let you go?
I don't understand.

922
01:08:30,211 --> 01:08:31,212
You've been there
for eight years,

923
01:08:31,245 --> 01:08:32,213
and he just let you go?

924
01:08:32,246 --> 01:08:33,680
Nothing happened?

925
01:08:33,713 --> 01:08:36,017
Paul, give me your keys.

926
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,517
Just give me your keys.

927
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,954
- Leave me alone.

928
01:08:39,987 --> 01:08:41,755
- We've got to talk
to Pastor Taylor about this.

929
01:08:41,788 --> 01:08:43,190
- I am tired!
Leave me alone!

930
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:57,038
- Are you sure you don't
want your dad to stay?

931
01:08:57,071 --> 01:08:58,705
I wouldn't particularly mind.

932
01:08:58,738 --> 01:09:00,107
- No, it's okay.

933
01:09:00,141 --> 01:09:01,208
- Okay.

934
01:09:01,242 --> 01:09:03,310
We'll be back late afternoon.

935
01:09:03,344 --> 01:09:05,612
Rest up.

936
01:09:05,645 --> 01:09:07,181
Boys, come on.
Let's go.

937
01:09:07,214 --> 01:09:08,648
Everybody else is
already in the car.

938
01:09:08,681 --> 01:09:09,984
- Alright.
- Thank you.

939
01:09:26,133 --> 01:09:27,567
- Come on.

940
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:32,806
Did you scratch Misty's car?

941
01:09:36,077 --> 01:09:38,245
Jem, you can't do that!

942
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:39,947
She told me
what happened at rehearsal.

943
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,848
I had to talk her down
from calling your folks!

944
01:09:41,881 --> 01:09:43,050
- She was trying to take over.

945
01:09:43,084 --> 01:09:44,251
- That doesn't matter!

946
01:09:44,285 --> 01:09:45,885
It's on the road
to giving us away!

947
01:09:51,992 --> 01:09:53,060
- I'm sorry.

948
01:10:07,674 --> 01:10:10,344
I'm sorry.

949
01:10:10,377 --> 01:10:14,281
- Just trying to figure
this out for us, alright?

950
01:10:21,322 --> 01:10:22,957
You're getting jealous.

951
01:10:32,099 --> 01:10:33,867
- You really don't want
to be with her?

952
01:10:35,436 --> 01:10:37,304
- No.

953
01:10:37,338 --> 01:10:40,007
- It's unbiblical to divorce.

954
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,674
Owen.

955
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:43,643
- Not if God never wanted
us to be together.

956
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:51,318
You're getting bold,
little wolf.

957
01:11:08,735 --> 01:11:11,172
Go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

958
01:11:11,205 --> 01:11:12,907
Come on!

959
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,275
Back here.

960
01:11:17,077 --> 01:11:19,113
To the right!
Through here!

961
01:11:19,146 --> 01:11:20,114
Stay here.

962
01:11:20,147 --> 01:11:21,714
Okay?

963
01:11:21,748 --> 01:11:22,815
Hey!

964
01:11:24,385 --> 01:11:26,220
Hey, you.

965
01:11:26,253 --> 01:11:27,720
- I got sick.

966
01:11:27,754 --> 01:11:29,957
Threw up all over Mona's car.

967
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:31,258
- Oh, no!

968
01:11:31,292 --> 01:11:33,127
- Poor thing.
We gotta pay for it.

969
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,995
Maybe it's something I ate.

970
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:36,763
- Hmm.
Yeah.

971
01:11:44,405 --> 01:11:45,372
Wait, wait, don't...

972
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,807
- What?

973
01:11:49,776 --> 01:11:51,512
- Nothing.

974
01:12:01,821 --> 01:12:04,959
- I'm so sorry, baby.

975
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:07,261
- I think that's it for now.

976
01:12:09,029 --> 01:12:10,797
We're out of Pepto.
Will you get me some?

977
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,166
- Yeah.
Yeah.

978
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:13,234
You bet.

979
01:12:13,267 --> 01:12:14,235
Let's get you into bed.

980
01:12:14,268 --> 01:12:16,003
- I need Pepto.

981
01:12:16,036 --> 01:12:17,371
- Okay.

982
01:12:24,178 --> 01:12:25,878
Wait till I come get you.

983
01:14:11,352 --> 01:14:12,486
- Just a sec!

984
01:14:31,705 --> 01:14:34,041
Oh, my goodness!
The Starling girls?

985
01:14:34,074 --> 01:14:35,476
What a surprise!

986
01:14:35,509 --> 01:14:36,677
- We brought cookies.

987
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:39,179
- Well, that is
just so thoughtful!

988
01:14:39,213 --> 01:14:40,948
My tummy is being
a little squirrelly,

989
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:42,483
but I bet Owen will love them.

990
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:45,552
Girls, why don't you come
inside for a bit and cool off?

991
01:14:45,586 --> 01:14:47,121
I've got some lemonade
in here.

992
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:48,589
Get some lemonade
fixed for you.

993
01:15:21,422 --> 01:15:22,456
- Where've you been?

994
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:30,564
- I needed some air,
so I went out,

995
01:15:30,597 --> 01:15:32,966
and I fell asleep
in the grass.

996
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,236
- You felt good enough
to ride bikes today, huh?

997
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,304
- Well, yeah, I was just--

998
01:15:37,337 --> 01:15:38,739
- And you just fell asleep?

999
01:15:38,772 --> 01:15:40,040
- Huh?

1000
01:15:40,073 --> 01:15:42,476
- You think I'm dumb?

1001
01:15:42,509 --> 01:15:44,111
- Why--
why would I think that?

1002
01:15:46,747 --> 01:15:48,182
- You're done dancing.

1003
01:15:49,349 --> 01:15:51,418
- What?
Dad.

1004
01:15:51,452 --> 01:15:53,020
- You flat-out lied
to my face.

1005
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:55,556
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

1006
01:15:55,589 --> 01:15:57,524
- Dad, come on.

1007
01:15:57,558 --> 01:15:59,126
- I can't have you pursuing
a life of self-centeredness,

1008
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:01,094
Jem.
- Dad, I've put--

1009
01:16:01,128 --> 01:16:02,396
I've put time into this.

1010
01:16:02,429 --> 01:16:03,597
You can't just take me
out of it.

1011
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:04,665
- This is better for you.
Trust me.

1012
01:16:04,698 --> 01:16:05,766
- Our dance is in a few days.

1013
01:16:05,799 --> 01:16:07,000
You can't take
this away from me!

1014
01:16:07,034 --> 01:16:08,101
- Enough of the back talk!

1015
01:16:08,135 --> 01:16:09,269
- You lie, too!

1016
01:16:21,615 --> 01:16:22,683
- What were you doing there?

1017
01:16:25,185 --> 01:16:26,553
- It was crazy--
- Don't lie.

1018
01:16:28,555 --> 01:16:30,424
I'm not asleep when you leave.

1019
01:16:37,331 --> 01:16:39,233
- I know what it looks like.

1020
01:16:41,268 --> 01:16:47,808
But Owen and I--

1021
01:16:47,841 --> 01:16:50,444
we've been
praying on it a lot.

1022
01:16:50,477 --> 01:16:52,179
And we're gonna figure it out.

1023
01:16:52,212 --> 01:16:53,514
- Figure out what?

1024
01:16:55,482 --> 01:16:56,783
- We're meant to be together.

1025
01:16:56,817 --> 01:16:59,186
God wants us to be together.

1026
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:00,287
- That doesn't make any sense.

1027
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,524
- Becca.

1028
01:17:03,557 --> 01:17:06,159
Becca, we prayed on it,
and we know.

1029
01:17:06,193 --> 01:17:08,762
And I promise you.

1030
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:11,231
I promise you,
it's gonna be okay.

1031
01:17:13,433 --> 01:17:16,403
But you cannot tell
anyone right now.

1032
01:17:16,436 --> 01:17:18,405
Okay?

1033
01:17:18,438 --> 01:17:20,807
Please. Please.

1034
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:23,410
Rebecca, please.

1035
01:17:23,443 --> 01:17:24,678
Just not right now.

1036
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:29,683
Becca, look at me.

1037
01:17:40,861 --> 01:17:43,230
- I told you to wait.

1038
01:17:43,263 --> 01:17:45,098
That was so stupid.

1039
01:17:45,132 --> 01:17:46,833
- You left me for hours.

1040
01:17:46,867 --> 01:17:48,235
- I had to go
to three different places.

1041
01:17:48,268 --> 01:17:50,137
Alright?
She could have seen you.

1042
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:52,806
- Well, my dad knows I lied,
and I have to quit the troupe.

1043
01:17:58,378 --> 01:17:59,513
- I'm sorry.

1044
01:17:59,546 --> 01:18:01,515
Hey.

1045
01:18:01,548 --> 01:18:03,617
I'm sorry, it's just--

1046
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:05,852
it got so messed up, and I...

1047
01:18:10,724 --> 01:18:12,526
- I have
to tell you something.

1048
01:18:19,566 --> 01:18:22,436
Rebecca saw me.

1049
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:25,606
- What?

1050
01:18:25,639 --> 01:18:28,609
- She brought y'all food,

1051
01:18:28,642 --> 01:18:31,411
and she saw me climb
out the window.

1052
01:18:33,547 --> 01:18:35,382
And...

1053
01:18:35,415 --> 01:18:36,617
she knows.

1054
01:18:38,385 --> 01:18:40,287
- What do you mean she knows?

1055
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,155
- Well, I had to tell her.

1056
01:18:42,189 --> 01:18:43,824
- You didn't have
to tell her anything.

1057
01:18:46,961 --> 01:18:48,729
Oh, shit.

1058
01:18:50,897 --> 01:18:53,300
Shit.
Shit.

1059
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:54,801
- Owen.
- Oh, no.

1060
01:18:55,569 --> 01:18:57,939
No, no.

1061
01:18:57,972 --> 01:19:00,807
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1062
01:19:00,841 --> 01:19:01,808
Okay.

1063
01:19:01,842 --> 01:19:04,311
- Maybe it's God.

1064
01:19:04,344 --> 01:19:06,813
Maybe now it's time.

1065
01:19:06,847 --> 01:19:09,683
- For what?

1066
01:19:09,716 --> 01:19:11,385
- To tell everyone.

1067
01:19:12,586 --> 01:19:15,389
- What?
No.

1068
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:18,558
- Why not?
- You--you don't understand.

1069
01:19:18,592 --> 01:19:20,327
It's not--
- No, I do understand.

1070
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,561
- I just need--
I just need a minute

1071
01:19:21,595 --> 01:19:23,330
to think, okay?

1072
01:19:24,631 --> 01:19:25,832
Okay.

1073
01:19:25,866 --> 01:19:29,302
So...

1074
01:19:29,336 --> 01:19:32,439
Jem...

1075
01:19:32,472 --> 01:19:34,408
I reckon we should stop,
just for a little while.

1076
01:19:36,376 --> 01:19:37,678
- What?

1077
01:19:37,711 --> 01:19:39,212
- Yeah, I just need
some time to think,

1078
01:19:39,246 --> 01:19:40,948
and just reckon it would
be better to be delicate.

1079
01:19:40,982 --> 01:19:43,817
- I--what--
what do you mean?

1080
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:46,720
- I mean, let's pray on this.

1081
01:19:46,753 --> 01:19:48,923
- No, I don't wanna stop.

1082
01:19:48,956 --> 01:19:50,257
- Just for a little while.

1083
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:51,591
Okay?
- Owen.

1084
01:19:53,627 --> 01:19:54,996
No, no, no, no, no.

1085
01:19:55,029 --> 01:19:56,530
- Just for a little while.
- I don't--

1086
01:19:56,563 --> 01:19:57,564
- I really gotta
get back, Jem.

1087
01:19:57,597 --> 01:19:59,733
I really gotta get back.

1088
01:19:59,766 --> 01:20:01,601
- Owen, I don't wanna stop.
- I gotta get back.

1089
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:03,670
We'll talk more soon, okay?
We'll talk more soon.

1090
01:20:03,704 --> 01:20:05,439
Okay?
Okay?

1091
01:20:08,842 --> 01:20:10,243
Jem!

1092
01:20:10,277 --> 01:20:12,612
I gotta get back!

1093
01:20:12,646 --> 01:20:14,414
We'll talk more
soon, alright?

1094
01:20:16,616 --> 01:20:18,385
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1095
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:58,492
- Hey, Jem.

1096
01:21:01,795 --> 01:21:02,930
Hey.

1097
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:11,005
- Uh, Dad.

1098
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,841
- I'm sorry
about the other day.

1099
01:21:40,467 --> 01:21:41,535
- Dad?

1100
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:42,803
Dad.

1101
01:21:42,836 --> 01:21:44,604
Dad.

1102
01:21:45,605 --> 01:21:47,108
Dad!

1103
01:21:47,141 --> 01:21:49,609
- Hey, hey, Paul?

1104
01:21:49,643 --> 01:21:50,912
Paul, hey, hey.

1105
01:21:50,945 --> 01:21:51,946
What'd you take?
- What happened?

1106
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:53,380
- Did you take something?

1107
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:54,581
- Paul.

1108
01:21:54,614 --> 01:21:56,383
Hey, come on.

1109
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:58,119
Let's get him up.

1110
01:21:58,152 --> 01:22:00,087
Get him up.

1111
01:22:00,121 --> 01:22:02,823
Okay, okay, okay.

1112
01:22:02,856 --> 01:22:04,791
Okay.
Hey, Jem, go call 911.

1113
01:22:04,825 --> 01:22:05,993
- Is he dying?
- You're okay, Dad.

1114
01:22:06,027 --> 01:22:06,994
- Just go.
Now.

1115
01:22:07,028 --> 01:22:08,129
- You're okay.

1116
01:22:08,162 --> 01:22:09,563
- Okay.
- You're okay.

1117
01:22:48,768 --> 01:22:51,072
They don't know if--

1118
01:22:51,105 --> 01:22:52,839
if he's gonna wake up.

1119
01:23:06,087 --> 01:23:08,923
He took some of my pills.

1120
01:23:08,956 --> 01:23:11,391
And they think he
accidentally took too many.

1121
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:24,138
Gotta get back
to the hospital

1122
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:26,007
and relieve Noah.

1123
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:32,779
- Mom, it wasn't an accident.

1124
01:23:32,812 --> 01:23:34,949
- Oh, Jem.
- It wasn't.

1125
01:23:34,982 --> 01:23:37,751
- Shut up!

1126
01:23:37,784 --> 01:23:40,654
I'm going back
to the hospital.

1127
01:23:40,687 --> 01:23:43,090
Don't say anything to them.

1128
01:23:43,124 --> 01:23:45,659
You take them to that cookout,
and you pretend

1129
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:46,726
like everything is normal.
- No!

1130
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,794
No!

1131
01:23:47,827 --> 01:23:49,997
- Stop being selfish!

1132
01:23:50,031 --> 01:23:52,033

Stop.

1151

- I'm fine.
I just wanna be alone.

Please.

1166
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,802

It's alright.

1167
01:26:08,835 --> 01:26:11,038
- I just wanna be alone.
- Talk to me.

1168
01:26:11,072 --> 01:26:12,806
- Please, go.
- It's okay.

1169
01:26:12,839 --> 01:26:14,674
- Go.
- You can talk to me.

1170
01:26:47,674 --> 01:26:50,277
Jem!

1171
01:26:50,311 --> 01:26:52,980
I--Jem!
Come on, let's go back!

1172
01:26:53,013 --> 01:26:54,281
- Let go of me!
- Let's go back!

1173
01:26:54,315 --> 01:26:55,648
- Let me--
- No, we're going back!

1174
01:26:55,682 --> 01:26:56,649
Come on!
Let's go back!

1175
01:26:56,683 --> 01:26:57,684
We're going back!
- Stop!

1176
01:26:57,717 --> 01:26:59,320
- Please, don't--

1177
01:27:21,342 --> 01:27:23,144
You psycho!

1178
01:28:02,349 --> 01:28:05,352
- Where is everyone?

1179
01:28:05,386 --> 01:28:06,819
- Mrs. Stone's house.

1180
01:28:11,225 --> 01:28:13,494
- Is it Dad?

1181
01:28:13,527 --> 01:28:16,796
- Pastor Taylor called

1182
01:28:16,829 --> 01:28:19,866
about Ben--

1183
01:28:19,899 --> 01:28:21,969
on top of everything else--

1184
01:28:22,002 --> 01:28:23,504
and I said that must have
been some kind of joke.

1185
01:28:23,537 --> 01:28:26,873
She wouldn't do that.

1186
01:28:26,907 --> 01:28:28,409
And then I found this.

1187
01:28:39,786 --> 01:28:42,356
It's Owen Taylor's
number, right?

1188
01:28:56,303 --> 01:28:57,837
What did you do with him?

1189
01:29:00,941 --> 01:29:01,976
Tell me.

1190
01:29:07,514 --> 01:29:09,316
Did you have sex with him?

1191
01:29:17,324 --> 01:29:19,159
I feel like I don't know you.

1192
01:29:22,596 --> 01:29:28,335
You're--you're ruined.

1193
01:29:32,373 --> 01:29:35,509
- We're connected.

1194
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:39,013
It's God's plan.

1195
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:40,414
- What was that?

1196
01:29:43,951 --> 01:29:49,323
Did you--does your dad
know about this?

1197
01:29:49,356 --> 01:29:50,958
Was it 'cause of you?

1198
01:29:50,991 --> 01:29:52,092
- No.
- Was it?

1199
01:29:52,126 --> 01:29:53,193
- I--no--

1200
01:29:53,227 --> 01:29:55,429
- Every word out of your mouth

1201
01:29:55,462 --> 01:29:56,896
is Satan flapping your tongue.

1202
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:58,565
He's sifted you like wheat!

1203
01:30:00,367 --> 01:30:02,436
- I'm sorry!

1204
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:10,244
Mom!

1205
01:30:10,277 --> 01:30:12,246
Mom!

1206
01:30:15,482 --> 01:30:17,518
Mom!

1207
01:30:17,551 --> 01:30:19,353
Please!

1208
01:30:22,156 --> 01:30:24,358
Mom, I'm sorry!

1209
01:30:46,447 --> 01:30:48,315
- You should get cleaned up.

1210
01:30:57,524 --> 01:31:00,961
This is a trying time.

1211
01:31:00,994 --> 01:31:04,965
And there's no denying,
given my sons are involved,

1212
01:31:04,998 --> 01:31:09,303
the personal, sensitive
nature of this.

1213
01:31:09,336 --> 01:31:10,504
I need to, uh--

1214
01:31:10,537 --> 01:31:12,239
I need to discuss
some things with you.

1215
01:31:15,943 --> 01:31:17,411
- Okay.

1216
01:31:19,446 --> 01:31:23,951
- Before Owen, did you have
impure thoughts?

1217
01:31:31,024 --> 01:31:33,494
Did you feel overtaken
by them?

1218
01:31:37,631 --> 01:31:39,166
- I don't know.

1219
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:41,335
- When did this thing
with Owen begin?

1220
01:31:42,469 --> 01:31:45,072
And...

1221
01:31:45,105 --> 01:31:46,974
whose idea was it?

1222
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:49,610
Who started it?
- Where is Owen?

1223
01:31:49,643 --> 01:31:50,644
- I don't know.

1224
01:31:50,677 --> 01:31:51,979
Why would you ask?

1225
01:31:58,685 --> 01:32:00,187
- He and I talked about it.

1226
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,456
And if we could just explain--
- Explain what?

1227
01:32:02,489 --> 01:32:04,191
- That we--we're meant
to be together.

1228
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:08,162
- Stop it.
- Woah, enough, alright.

1229
01:32:12,099 --> 01:32:13,967
You've let Satan
into your heart.

1230
01:32:14,001 --> 01:32:15,369
- I haven't.

1231
01:32:15,402 --> 01:32:18,038
- No, you have.

1232
01:32:18,071 --> 01:32:19,640
Why do you think
you're hurting

1233
01:32:19,673 --> 01:32:21,041
the people that love you?

1234
01:32:25,479 --> 01:32:27,247
Listen.

1235
01:32:27,281 --> 01:32:30,317
If you think that God wanted
you and Owen to be together,

1236
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:32,085
how are you so certain
that wasn't Satan

1237
01:32:32,119 --> 01:32:33,587
whispering into your ear?

1238
01:32:39,693 --> 01:32:41,328
- If you'd just get
Owen here--

1239
01:32:41,361 --> 01:32:44,665
- Owen doesn't want
to talk to you.

1240
01:32:44,698 --> 01:32:46,500
His life is ruined.

1241
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:48,669
He's got to give up
his position.

1242
01:32:48,702 --> 01:32:50,471
Misty wants to leave him.

1243
01:32:50,504 --> 01:32:52,072
- Your son had
a big part in that.

1244
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:57,544
- Certainly, but, uh...

1245
01:32:57,578 --> 01:33:00,147
but he says that

1246
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:02,983
Jem brought him to sin.

1247
01:33:04,785 --> 01:33:06,720
He says that she inhibited

1248
01:33:06,753 --> 01:33:08,422
his ability
to control himself.

1249
01:33:11,725 --> 01:33:13,427
Jem, is any of that true?

1250
01:33:17,397 --> 01:33:19,500
I mean, I ain't saying that he
ain't at fault, okay?

1251
01:33:19,533 --> 01:33:21,602
That's clear.
He is.

1252
01:33:23,403 --> 01:33:27,608
But we're here, and we're
talking to you about this.

1253
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:31,011
And it is clear to me that
Satan has got his hold on you.

1254
01:33:39,586 --> 01:33:41,622
This--

1255
01:33:41,655 --> 01:33:44,558
this is a spiritual attack.

1256
01:33:44,591 --> 01:33:46,793
You've tumbled
down a very dark hole, Jem.

1257
01:33:48,695 --> 01:33:51,064
I tell you something, though.
We can still save you.

1258
01:33:51,732 --> 01:33:57,604
God is our strength,
our victory over Satan.

1259
01:33:57,638 --> 01:34:00,841
Do you want to be saved?

1260
01:34:00,874 --> 01:34:04,311
- Yes.

1261
01:34:04,344 --> 01:34:06,413
- I tell you, I think this
family needs a big reset.

1262
01:34:06,446 --> 01:34:08,081
Alright?

1263
01:34:08,115 --> 01:34:09,583
And I think the best thing
for everyone

1264
01:34:09,616 --> 01:34:12,252
is for you to go away
for a little while.

1265
01:34:13,654 --> 01:34:15,289
Now, your mother and I have--

1266
01:34:15,322 --> 01:34:16,857
we discussed it,

1267
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:19,126
and we decided
that it's best for you

1268
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:20,427
to spend time
at King's Valley.

1269
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,796
- Please, no.

1270
01:34:24,231 --> 01:34:25,699
- Your father
and I've let y'all down.

1271
01:34:25,732 --> 01:34:27,334
I won't make
that mistake again.

1272
01:34:27,367 --> 01:34:29,803
- Please, Mom.
Please.

1273
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,508
- You gotta do this.

1274
01:34:37,912 --> 01:34:40,614
Or you can't be part
of this family.

1275
01:34:40,647 --> 01:34:42,549
I just--

1276
01:34:42,583 --> 01:34:44,851
I can't have that influence
on your siblings.

1277
01:34:58,799 --> 01:35:03,437
- We have an incident
to bring to you all today.

1278
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:07,374
Someone who would like
to talk to everyone.

1279
01:35:07,407 --> 01:35:09,242
Jem.

1280
01:35:11,913 --> 01:35:15,849
Jem Starling needs our help.

1281
01:35:15,882 --> 01:35:18,652
So we're gonna
help her, right?

1282
01:35:18,685 --> 01:35:21,555
Yes, sir.

1283
01:35:21,588 --> 01:35:23,523
- Alright.
Come on.

1284
01:35:26,928 --> 01:35:28,762
Jem.

1285
01:35:58,692 --> 01:36:03,563
- To my fellow congregants,

1286
01:36:03,597 --> 01:36:07,701
I--

1287
01:36:07,734 --> 01:36:11,939
I come before you,
humbled and ashamed.

1288
01:36:11,973 --> 01:36:16,643
I admit that I am a sinner.

1289
01:36:16,677 --> 01:36:19,613
I repent
all of the wrong deeds

1290
01:36:19,646 --> 01:36:24,418
that I have carried out
in my body,

1291
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:26,687
and the lustful
and immoral thoughts

1292
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:27,754
in my mind.

1293
01:36:35,696 --> 01:36:37,898
I want to recommit to pure--

1294
01:36:37,932 --> 01:36:39,599
purity.

1295
01:36:39,633 --> 01:36:42,469
And I humbly ask
for your forgiveness.

1296
01:36:42,502 --> 01:36:46,707
As unworthy as I am,
I ask the Lord to forgive me,

1297
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:48,976
and I ask you to help me
walk with him again.

1298
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:50,343
Thank you.

1299
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,482
- Alright.

1300
01:36:55,515 --> 01:36:58,986
Now, anyone who would like
to approach Jem,

1301
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:01,455
offer your forgiveness,
please approach.

1302
01:37:17,504 --> 01:37:18,973
- I forgive you, sweetheart.

1303
01:37:23,677 --> 01:37:25,046
- I forgive you.

1304
01:37:25,079 --> 01:37:26,680
May God forgive you.

1305
01:37:36,924 --> 01:37:38,825
- I forgive you.

1306
01:37:42,662 --> 01:37:44,966
- I forgive you.

1307
01:37:44,999 --> 01:37:46,700
- I forgive you.

1308
01:38:37,884 --> 01:38:39,120
- Jem.

1309
01:38:39,153 --> 01:38:40,754
I'm an idiot, okay?
I'm sorry.

1310
01:38:40,787 --> 01:38:42,756
I'm so sorry.
- What are you doing here?

1311
01:38:42,789 --> 01:38:44,558
- Will you come walk
with me just for a second?

1312
01:38:44,591 --> 01:38:45,960
Please, please.
- Why? Why should I?

1313
01:38:45,993 --> 01:38:47,094
- Please, just listen to me.

1314
01:38:47,128 --> 01:38:48,395
- I thought you didn't wanna
see me.

1315
01:38:48,428 --> 01:38:49,729
- I need to explain
myself to you.

1316
01:38:49,763 --> 01:38:51,398
Please, listen.

1317
01:38:51,431 --> 01:38:52,732
I let my dad get
in my head, okay?

1318
01:38:52,766 --> 01:38:54,501
And I got scared.

1319
01:38:54,534 --> 01:38:55,937
- Well, he's gonna be here
any second, so you should go.

1320
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:58,072
- But please, just hear me.
Just for a minute.

1321
01:38:58,105 --> 01:38:59,506
I'm going back to the church
in Puerto Rico,

1322
01:38:59,539 --> 01:39:00,774
and I want you to come
with me.

1323
01:39:00,807 --> 01:39:02,076
- Are you serious?

1324
01:39:02,109 --> 01:39:03,510
- Yes, I'm serious.
I love you.

1325
01:39:03,543 --> 01:39:04,845
I wanna be with you.

1326
01:39:04,878 --> 01:39:06,746
You are the only one
that sees me.

1327
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,381
I don't wanna be without you.

1328
01:39:08,415 --> 01:39:09,917
- What about Misty, huh?
- None of it matters.

1329
01:39:09,951 --> 01:39:11,384
- What about your family?

1330
01:39:11,418 --> 01:39:12,719
- As long as I have you,
none of it matters.

1331
01:39:12,752 --> 01:39:13,787
Alright?

1332
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:16,023
Jem, look at me.

1333
01:39:16,057 --> 01:39:17,824
- What is this?

1334
01:39:17,858 --> 01:39:19,126
- Mrs. Starling, I--

1335
01:39:21,162 --> 01:39:23,630
- You get away from her!

1336
01:39:23,663 --> 01:39:25,398
You knew exactly
what you were doing.

1337
01:39:25,432 --> 01:39:26,399
Get off my property.

1338
01:39:26,433 --> 01:39:27,400
- Jem--

1339
01:39:27,434 --> 01:39:28,468
- Now!

1340
01:39:40,547 --> 01:39:42,083
It's okay, Jem.

1341
01:39:42,116 --> 01:39:43,884
Let's go inside, honey.

1342
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:56,163
Jem!

1343
01:39:56,197 --> 01:39:58,465
Jem!

1344
01:39:59,699 --> 01:40:01,735
Jem!
No!

1345
01:40:01,768 --> 01:40:03,737
- Jem!
- Go!

1346
01:40:03,770 --> 01:40:05,006
Go, go, go!

1347
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:06,640
- No, no!
Jem!

1348
01:40:15,049 --> 01:40:16,516
- Oh, my...
You're...

1349
01:40:50,918 --> 01:40:52,452
- Thanks.

1350
01:40:59,893 --> 01:41:01,228
You okay?

1351
01:41:01,262 --> 01:41:02,829
- Mm-hmm.

1352
01:41:08,202 --> 01:41:12,839
- That was unforgivable,
what I did to you.

1353
01:41:12,872 --> 01:41:14,708
I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

1354
01:41:14,741 --> 01:41:18,812
- No, it's not.
And with your dad--

1355
01:41:18,845 --> 01:41:21,648
- I don't really wanna think
about that right now.

1356
01:41:24,285 --> 01:41:26,053
- I just wish
I could take it back.

1357
01:41:28,255 --> 01:41:29,789
- It's okay.

1358
01:41:42,203 --> 01:41:44,205
- None of this will matter
when we're out there.

1359
01:41:49,809 --> 01:41:51,678
I can't wait to show
it all to you.

1360
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,822
Well, whenever
is good for you, you know,

1361
01:42:02,856 --> 01:42:05,759
I'm just an hour out,
so you let me know.

1362
01:42:05,792 --> 01:42:07,094
Yeah, that works perfect.

1363
01:42:07,128 --> 01:42:08,963
That works perfect.

1364
01:42:08,996 --> 01:42:11,165
There's new tires on there,
so you won't have to go back

1365
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:12,299
to the shop any time soon.

1366
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:14,201
I think you'll be happy.

1367
01:42:14,235 --> 01:42:15,202
Perfect.
We'll see you then.

1368
01:42:15,236 --> 01:42:17,637
Thanks, Andy.

1369
01:42:17,670 --> 01:42:19,706
Found someone to buy my car.

1370
01:42:19,739 --> 01:42:21,108
So we can leave tomorrow.

1371
01:42:26,914 --> 01:42:28,848
Whoo!

1372
01:42:34,221 --> 01:42:35,322
Aren't you hot in this?

1373
01:42:35,356 --> 01:42:37,590
- Hmm.

1374
01:42:37,624 --> 01:42:38,658
- Hmm?

1375
01:42:50,938 --> 01:42:52,672
Should we grab some lunch?

1376
01:42:52,705 --> 01:42:56,843
- Um,
I think I'm gonna shower.

1377
01:42:56,876 --> 01:42:57,877
- I'll bring you
back something?

1378
01:42:57,912 --> 01:42:58,878
- Sure.

1379
01:42:58,913 --> 01:42:59,947
- Yeah?

1380
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:00,948
Burger? Fries?

1381
01:43:00,981 --> 01:43:01,982
Milkshake?

1382
01:43:02,016 --> 01:43:04,318
Chili cheese fries?

1383
01:43:04,351 --> 01:43:05,885
Does that sound good?
That's what I'm bringing you.

1384
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,288
- Okay.

1385
01:43:10,257 --> 01:43:11,225
- Alright.

1386
01:43:11,258 --> 01:43:12,792
Don't drown.

1387
01:43:34,381 --> 01:43:36,917
- Lord, help me to be content.

1388
01:43:40,087 --> 01:43:42,655
