12
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,762
Yep.

13
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,531
- Hey.
- Hi.

14
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,849
Can I... ls it gonna hurt?

15
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,889
[laughs] No, it's fine.

16

[sighs] on...

17
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,326

- Uh... You sure?
- [softly] Yeah.

19
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,250
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah. Have a great day.

20
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,970
- I think I...
- I got it.

21
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,246

- Come on, Katy.
- What?

25
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,968
I can put a seat belt on.

26

32
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,321
What?

33
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,764
What am I supposed to say?

34
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,727
You can say anything you want.

35
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,644
Come on.

36
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,960
[both speak French]

37
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,410
Where's Philip?

38
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,325
He's asleep. He's exhausted.

39
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,481
What should I do?

40
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,290
Just put it somewhere.

41
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,688
I closed your wireless account.

42
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,166
Thanks.

43
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,210
What do you want to do about
all your stuff in the city?

44
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,250
You've got some clothes here
in the closet

45
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,846
and I have some more stuff for you
in the attic, if you want.

46
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,729
I'm sure that'll do fine.

48
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,571
It's just like old times.

49
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,130
Hey, Daddy.

50
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,761
[Dad] So, what happens now?

51
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,611
I'm guessing you give a speech
of some sort.

52
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,240
What do you want to do, El?

53
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,448
Something else.

54
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,329
I'm open to ideas.

55
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,926
I'm looking for
a part-timer on campus.

56

[birds chirping]

57
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,843
Was I such a different person
when I lived here?

58
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,166
It was, like, a thousand years ago.

59
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,488
You could take some classes.

60
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,482
Could we talk about it later?

61
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,450
What about Conor?

62
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,367
[Eleanor laughs] Hey...

63
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,364
- Auntie Em!
- Hi. [laughs]

64
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,045
Missed you.

65
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,884
I missed you.

66
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,929
What'd you guys do today, huh?

67
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,605
Chasing butterflies.

68
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,087
- Mm.
- I catched one.

69
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,366
- Really?
- "Caught."

70
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,561
I caught one.

71
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,404
You did?

72
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,400
Jonah Greenbaum ate
a caterpillar at school.

73
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,210
That sounds pretty gross.

74
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,722
Yeah. Will he have a
butterfly in his tummy?

75
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,041
I don't know, honey.

76
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,050
Um, let's, let's give her some time
to get settled in, OK, babe?

77
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,208
- [Eleanor] Bye, honey.
- Bye.

78
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,170
Do you need anything?

79
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,163
Nope. Thank you.

80
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,961
I'm going into town in a bit
if you want to join, get out?

81
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,964
Yeah. You yell up at me
when you're going?

82
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,610
[birds chirping]

83
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,251
[birds chirping, train whistle

[footsteps approaching]

86
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,089
- You ready?
- Yeah.

87
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,924
[exhales]

88
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,484
[insects chirping, chittering]

89
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,927
[Eleanor] I feel like
I'm seven years old.

90
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,045
- Why?
- Being here with you.

91
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,008
You remember that time you and Mom took
Katy and me to see Cats for my birthday?

92
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,921
It was a wash for me.

93
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,445
[laughs softly]

94
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,084
We came in from New Haven.

95
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,890
Yeah, I remember.

96
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,728
I remember the train ride
better than anything.

97
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,201
We were all so gussied up.

98
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,641
Katy and me wearing those
silly matching dresses,

99
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,041
standing on the seats,
looking out at everything,

100
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,004
pointing at this and that.

101
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,366
Everything seemed so limitless.

102
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,284
It was.

103
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,130
It still is.

104
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,248
How many more times do you think
I'll remember that moment?

105
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,811
What?

106
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,566
It was such a good moment,
but I'll probably only...

107
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,730
...remember it a couple of more
times in my life, if that.

108
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,327
Mm, I suppose so.

109
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,921
[train whistle blows in distance]

110
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,523
Whoa, hey. Hey, El.

111
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,845
H9)'-

112
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,367
- Hey, Stu.
- Wow.

113
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,968
- Hey. All right.
- You remember my father?

114
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,168
- Hey. How are you?
- Good, thanks.

115
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,004
Good.

116
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,242
You're Conor's chef.

117
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,528
[chuckles]
Yeah. Yeah, I'm his chef.

118
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,131
Yeah.

119
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,322
How's the restaurant?

120
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,289
Good. Good.
We're doing good.

121
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,249
Everything's all right.
Yeah.

122
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,323
El, you have to register.

123
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,851
We- we have to head off.

124
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,844
All right, yeah, I got to get this back
to the restaurant, but it's good to...

125
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,809
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.

126
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,450
Hey, if you ever want
to get, like, coffee or...

127
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,251
or something...
you know, shoot me a text

128
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,640
- or call or something.
- OK.

129
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,643
Good seeing you.

130
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,644
- So, Lillian is expecting you.
- Mm-hmm.

131
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,164
She and I were colleagues at NYU.

132
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,890
I know. You told me.

133
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,810
You have...

134
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,891
- pencils and notebooks and all that?
- Yes, Dad.

135
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,651
I have class, and, um...

136
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,723
then I have patients...

137
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,326
so I guess I'll...

138
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,687
see you at the house
later tonight.

139
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,365
OK.

140
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,849
- Hey, El?
- Yeah?

141
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,247
Have a good first day.

142
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,004
I Will.

143
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,687
[indistinct chatter, phone ringing]

144
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,721
How's the weather down there?

145
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,882
- Balmy.
- Do we have an appointment?

146
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,769
I'm Eleanor Rigby.

147
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,570
That must be tough.

148
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,724
I'm here to talk my way
into your Identity Theory class.

149
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,166
Oh, you're Julian's kid.

150
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,567
I need some caffeine.
You're welcome to walk with me.

151
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,768
OK.

152
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,207
So, was Julian into
the Beatles or something?

153
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,125
- Sort of.
- What do you mean, sort of?

154
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,730
Um, he met my mom on the street during
one of the Beatles' hoax reunions.

155
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,168
There was a rumor they were gonna play
a show here before Lennon died,

156
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,288
just like the one they did
on the rooftop in London.

157
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,808
My parents stood next to each other
waiting for the band to never show.

158
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,281
Nostalgists.

159
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,970
- That, and my dad's surname is Rigby.
- You must detest the Beatles.

160
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,929
No, not really.

161
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,044
[sighs] Do you want something?

162
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,565
Uh...

163
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,361
Double espresso,
three Splendas, please.

164
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,125
So, why do you want
to be in my class?

165
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,806
Your course sounds interesting.

166
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,322
And... look, you're
a colleague of my dad's, so...

167
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,926
Yeah, well, you got to
do better than that.

168
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,527
- You want me to make something up?
- Well, most people do.

169
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,644
You're just taking classes
just to take classes, right?

170
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,485
- Something like that.
- Well, let me save you some time.

171
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,808
All the perpetual students,
the hedge-fund wives,

172
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,564
and your generation of too many choices,

173
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,247
they usually go to Tim Gunn's class and
listen to him talk about Project Runway,

174
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,649
or you could take the art history class
on the advent of color photography

175
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,928
just for good cocktail party
conversation.

176
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,805
My "generation of too many choices"?

177
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,122
Democracy has its drawbacks.

178
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,129
[woman] Here's a double espresso,
three Splendas.

179

00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,162
I was gonna say
something good,

355
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,971
something that
would have...

356
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,964
solved all our problems
and made everything all better,

357
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,964
but you know what,
I forgot what it was.

358
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,284
That's too bad.

359
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,124
Isn't it?

360
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,644
I'm gonna go.

361
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,564
No.

362
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,371
All I want...

363
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,047
is a chance
to just talk it out.

364
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,601
Then after that, after that
you can disappear,

365
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,882
to wherever it is
you disappear to.

366
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,690
[paramedic] You ready, sir?

367
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,727
Yeah... yeah,
I was born ready.

368
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,325
- Nice and easy.
- Yeah...

369
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,681
Watch your step.

370
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,040
[Conor] I'll see you around.

371
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,690
Bye, Conor.

372
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,289
[paramedic] All right,
watch your head coming up.

373
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,566
- Got him?
- I got him.

374
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,200
- [Conor groans]
- Now, take it easy.

375
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,485
[Conor] Can I keep stalking you?

376
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,484
[paramedic] Put your arm there for me?

377
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,404
[ambulance doors close]

378
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,200
[siren chirps]

379
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,762
- [footsteps approaching]
- [professor] Hey. Hey, you OK?

380
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,161
- [siren chirping]
- Yeah. Um...

381
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,970
What happened?

382
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,442
No. My husband...

383
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,090
[sighs]

384
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,362
I don't know what
to call him anymore.

385
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,490
[wry chuckle] Oh, yeah.
I have one of those.

386
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,603
So... want to, want to
walk with me?

387
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,161
Join me for a drink
or something?

388
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,964
No, no, not right now, thank you.

389
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,050
[whispers] Are you awake?

390
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,089
[whimpers]

391
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,242
Auntie Em, are you awake?

392
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,408
No, Philip.

393
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,289
Your eyes are open.

394
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,011
[sighing] Apparently.

395
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,364
Why do you have
your shoes on in bed?

396
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,130
[laughs softly]

397
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,044
Morning, sunshine.

398
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,001
[Philip] Mom's making French toast.

399
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,003
All right, I'll be right down.

400
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,685
OK.

401
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,888
[dog barking in distance]

402
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,090
[groans softly]

403
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,925
[dog barking in distance]

404
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,042
Charlie called for you again.

405
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,569
[Eleanor] Great.

406
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,241
You came in late last night.

407
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,408
What's with the feast?

408
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,609
We have a special guest star.

409
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,728
Outside.

410
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,648
But it's been hard.
There's a barrier...

411
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,243
Good morning.

412
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,887
No fucking way.

413
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,849
El...

414
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,729
- Come on.
- What the hell are you doing?

415
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,803
- Come on. Just one second.
- Don't touch me, Katy...

416
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,167
- No, no, no, no.
- Don't... touch me!

417
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,084
Don't... don't...

418
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,641
' L€t

I will bite you!
I swear to God I will bite you!

421
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,851
I will bite you back!

422
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,684
Ow! Ow!

[panting grows calmer]

426
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,563
[Eleanor] Goddamn it.

[panfing]

428
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,685
You sandbagged me.

429
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,721
He chairs the Psychology Department.

430
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,645
Good for him.

431
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,361
Well, I just thought he'd be
a bit more qualified to...

432
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,524
to deal with your
circumstance.

433
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,762
What's my circumstance?

434
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,483
[door opens, closes]

435
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,001
He was my grandson.

436
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,045
I lost him, too.

437
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,120
None of us know how to help you.

438
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,642
Well, neither do I.

439
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,323
I'm so glad they delegated
the speech to you.

440
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,249
He's not a stranger...

441
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,287
...that some hospital referred you to.
He's a colleague of mine.

442
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,207
I don't think one session
a week would hurt.

443
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,721
Why can't you talk to me
once a week, Dad?

444
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,042
- Why outsource it?
- I'm not outsourcing it,

445
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,722
and I don't really think you
want to talk to me about it.

446
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,167
I don't need to talk
to another therapist.

447
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,890
Eleanor...

448
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,527
Please, stop reminding me
that something's wrong.

449
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,967
That's... not my intention.

450
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,283
Then... please let me
stop thinking about it.

451
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,724
Tragedy is a foreign country.

452
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,602
We don't know how to
talk to the natives.

453
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,366
What are you talking about?

454
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,364
[door closes]

455
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,682
[footsteps approaching]

456
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,966
You know, there's this
really cool thing called chairs.

457
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,202
Yeah, I, I heard about those.

458
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,931
It's actually not
too shabby down here.

459
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,209
You OK?

460
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,806
Sure.

461
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,689
Liar.

462
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,330
Sure.

463
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,808
When's your next class?

464
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,485
It's yours.

465
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,651
Oh.

466
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,921
Do you like hamburgers?

467
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,526
I used to be a vegan.

468
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,331
Mostly 'cause
my husband was a vegan.

469
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,086
Not that I don't agree
with most of the tenets

470
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,322
of vegan ideology, but...

471
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,642
he was one
of those reformed socialists

472
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,122
who seemed sexy
before the '60s started to fade.

473
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,691
Does he teach?

474
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,127
He won tenure
at University of Oregon,

475
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,685
and I got it here.

476
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,081
He went soft, I stayed hard,
that was that.

477
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,009
You have kids?

478
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,486
A son.

479
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,409
I'm not sure
why people have kids.

480
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,764
You know, first there's
the nine months of agony,

481
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,724
your body hurts,
it's hot, it's cold,

482
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,287
you crave pickles,
and there's no words to describe

483
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,283
whatever the fuck labor is.

484
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,283
And then this
little stranger comes out,

485
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,090
sucking every bit of life
you have left in you,

486
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,288
and as soon as you're ready
to jump out of a window,

487
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,046
all of a sudden, he smiles.

488
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,770
[laughs softly]

489
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,289
Jesus Christ, this is good.

490
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,006
And whatever you do,
however you do it,

491
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,049
however you imagine
your child's life,

492
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,168
or what kind of parent you'd be,

493
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,203
29 years later,
he's in some shrink's office

494
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,886
accusing you of some stupid
thing that you said or did

495
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,725
that for the life of you, you
can't remember saying or doing.

496
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,086
Tell me at your age you're not taking
classes out of boredom.

497
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,891
I don't know what
the hell I'm doing.

498
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,963
What was before this?

499
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,885
Mm, life in general.

500
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,644
Any kids?

501
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,643
Mm-hmm.

502
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,802
Boy or girl?

503
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,849
Boy.

504
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,729
Good luck.

505
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,644
[laughs] Thanks.

506
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,122
Who's that man who chased you
out of my classroom the other day?

507
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,371
He went soft, I stayed hard,
that was that.

508
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,802
[sighs]

509
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,804
[door opens]

510
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,371
[whispering] Hey.

511
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,965
Guess what?

512
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,645
What?

513
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,564
I got asked out on a date.

514
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,803
Flaughsl

515
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,601
I look stupid.

516
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,807
You look beautiful.

517
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,286
Oh, don't be nice.

518
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,851
[sighs]

519
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,840
This... oh, fuck, I don't understand
why this asshole walked into my library.

520
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,843
<i>_</i> - Katy...
" [$l9h$, sputters]

521
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,411
Don't "Katy" me.
Oh, my God,

522
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,289
Mom and Dad
aren't even back yet.

523
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,090
Maybe I should just...
pull the plug.

524
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,244
No. He'll be here any second.
Calm down.

525
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,920
I'll watch him.

526
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,164
[sighs]

527
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,926
We're just going to pretend
to be interested in each other

528
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,923
over cheap cabernet,
and he's gonna, like, ask me

529
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,765
all the same stupid questions
that they ask about Philip,

530
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,605
like who the dad is, and then
look at me like I'm half a moron

531
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,524
for the choices that I've made.

532
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,206
You know, it was easier
when I was an actress,

533
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,885
because I could
just fuck my costars,

534
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,845
but this real-life
pseudo-adult crap sucks my ass.

535
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,530
Katy, shut up.

536
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,201
[sighs]

537
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,325
I feel fat.

538
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,289
You're not fat.

539
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,722
You were always...

540
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,963
who you were gonna be,
I mean, like a woman.

541
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,091
[sighs] I always... wasn't yet.

542
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,368
Then I was a fraud.

543
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,042
Sometimes I hardly
recognize you with that hair.

544
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,726
Mm.

545
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,843
That's gorgeous.

546
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,321
[Philip] Goddamn it!

547
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,968
Uh, excuse me?

548
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,610
Hey, come in here.

549
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,922
[door opens]

550
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,605
What was that?

551
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,842
This keeps breaking off.

552
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,641
OK, but we don't say that, lovey.

553
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,086
[Philip] Why?

554
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,767
[Katy] 'Cause it's not
a nice thing to say.

555
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,450
Are you sure that you're
OK to watch him?

556
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,204
Mom and Dad should
be back pretty soon.

557
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,681
- [doorbell rings]
- He's here.

558
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,565
- Are y... you sure?
- Yes, I'm positive.

559
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,048
- [stammers] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Change.

560
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,804
[crickets chirping]

561
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,803
[dog barking in distance]

562
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,849
So, what do you want to do?

563
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,287
[chuckles]

564
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,926
What do you want to do?

565
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,885
Hurry.

566
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,451
I'm coming.

567
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,283
Can I get electrocuted
by lightning bugs?

568
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,171
No. They're harmless.

569
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,442
[I low-tempo music]

570
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,489
[chuckles softly]

571
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,847
This is pretty good, isn't it?

572
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,280
Yeah, it is.

573
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,851
H9)'-

574
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,604
Hmm?

575
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,641
There's only one heart
in this body.

576
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,689
Have mercy on me?

577
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,481
Shut up.

578
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,762
Want to go to your place?

579
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,888
Yes, please.

580
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,929
I'll tell you what.

581
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,242
- What?
- You make the first move,

582
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,249
and then I'll follow you,

583
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,851
'cause this is...

584
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,809
this is too nice.

585
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,683
Hey, can we drive
somewhere aimlessly?

586
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,490
Yeah.

587
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,250
Right now?

588
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,129
Vvheneven

589
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,962
Can we do it this weekend?

590
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,770
Yes.

591
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,011
Where do you want to go?

592
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,322
No destination.

593
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,967
Just rent a car.

594
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,841
We can sing along to whatever
stupid songs are on the radio.

595
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,725
We'll just drive pointlessly
until we feel like stopping.

596
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,447
What would we do then?

597
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,047
Mm, I don't know,
eat something, walk somewhere.

598
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,202
Use your imagination.

599
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,650
Well, I... well...

600
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,684
Your other imagination.

601
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,729
[laughing]

602
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,850
- I have a pretty dirty imagination.
- Stop!

603
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,002
[laughing]

604
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,124
Come on.

605
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,090
Hey, Rigby?

606
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,805
What?

607
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,048
I love you.

608
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,368
[I music continues]

609
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,203
[laughs quietly]

610
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,722
[door creaks open]

611
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,882
[door creaks closed]

612
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,447
[yawns quietly]

613
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,965
[whispering] It went that badly?

614
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,610
[sighs]

615
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,730
I could've given him
a normal kiss good night

616
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,928
instead ofjamming
my tongue down his throat.

617
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,170
[both laughing]

618
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,725
So he's cool?

619
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,803
I am so fucked.

620
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,602
You have a little
to drink tonight?

621
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,125
Yeah.

622
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,284
- What's that?
- Shh.

623
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,920
Philip gave it to me so I won't
be afraid of the dark.

624
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,729
You still having trouble with that?

625
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,803
Yeah, guess so. Come on.

626
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,322
Were you OK with him?

627
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,045
Yeah.

628
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,411
Oh, I don't mean...

629
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,324
That's not what I was...

630
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,886
I just...

631
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,405
I'm OK.

632
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,244
Is it OK to be OK?

633
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,323
Yeah, be OK all you want.
[chuckles]

634
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,765
Are you really OK?

635
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,440
I can pretend.

636
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,924
[sighs]

637
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,209
All of a sudden, I kind of miss him.

638
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,601
Who?

639
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,444
Conor.

640
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,689
[sighs]

641
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,008
He came by the house the other day.

642
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,889
He talked with Mom,

643
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,567
and... she told me not to tell you.

644
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,643
I'm sorry, Katy.

645
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,531
What for?

646
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,364
I feel like I just dropped in
on you guys

647
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,000
and I sucked all the air
out of the room.

648
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,690
You are kind of a selfish bitch.

649
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,169
Hey. You don't have
to be so honest.

650
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,526
No.

651
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,887
I was really mad at you.

652
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,451
I know.

653
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,443
I'm still really mad at you.

654
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,965
I know.

655
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,929
[Eleanor sighs]

656
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,730
And you pulled the floorboards
out from under Conor.

657
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,922
He threw Cody's stuff
into the closet.

658
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,047
And then ten minutes later,
he ordered Chinese from Madame Wu's.

659
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,649
I tried for six months.

660
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,048
We were a million miles away
in the same room, and...

661
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,249
...l started to think thoughts
I never thought I'd have.

662
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,729
How have you and Mom
made it this far?

663
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,970
I'm not sure.

664
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,169
Endurance.

665
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,649
Everyone starts out thinking,
"This is forever."

666
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,365
But then things get hard...

667
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,810
...at some point or another.

668
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,248
And then other things don't pan out
the way you thought they would.

669
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,602
I suppose the trick is
not running for the hills,

670
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,969
even when you think it's the
most rational thing to do.

671
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,441
[sighs]

672
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,807
I don't know.

673
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,563
[indistinct talking]

674
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,482
I hate this room.

675
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,081
I've seen worse.

676
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,807
[sighs] Where?

677
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,201
- Huh?
- Where have you seen worse?

678
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,925
NYU, Yale...

679
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,764
Oh, Yale's butt ugly.

680
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,968
New Haven's butt ugly.

681
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,451
Did you attend any of
those fine institutions?

682
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,968
NYU, and then I grew up at Yale
when my dad was there.

683
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,168
Oh, of course,
you're a faculty brat.

684
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,731
Mm-hmm.

685
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,605
You and my son would
get along like hotcakes.

686
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,326
Not that I'm trying to
set you up or anything.

687
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,403
He lives in Washington,
the state.

688
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,121
He's been pretending to write a novel
there for the last four years.

689
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,929
[sighs]

690
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,845
Learn anything
interesting at NYU?

691
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,207
I abandoned a dissertation.

692
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,129
- Mm! Bold!
- Mm-hmm.

693
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,611
What department?

694
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,444
[chuckles] Anthropology.

695
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,568
Mm. Social? Linguistic?

696
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,927
I was writing an ethnography
on the social world

697
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,889
of performance artists in Paris.

698
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,204
Musicians, dancers, actors, et cetera.

699
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,010
Why?

700
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,086
I don't know;
my mom is a musician

701
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,288
and she's French, so...

702
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,683
No, I mean why did
you abandon it?

703
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,362
Don't tell me something
stupid like love.

704
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,682
[quiet laugh]

705
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,250
You're very talkative.

706
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,290
It's more fun
listening to you.

707
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,720
You'll get over that.

708
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,042
[chuckles]

709
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,809
<i>L</i> 90t pregnant.

710
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,091
Ah, that.

711
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,044
[sighs]

712
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,850
You want to teach this class?

713
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,001
Not really.

714
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,650

Let him out.

1081
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,687
He hightails it,
chasing the sun to nowhere.

1082
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,445
He ran away?

1083
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,523
Mm-hmm.

1084
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,603
I imagine he's happy
wherever he wound up.

Oh, that would be a first.

to talk to your son?

1102

Some holiday too long ago.

1103
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,124
Is it sad that I don't remember?

1104
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,645
Probably.

1105

I waded out, holding you...

1188
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:58,087
...thinking, at one point,
"This might not be the best idea."

1189
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,448
But you were game.

1190
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,722
Or I imagined that you were game

1191
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,803

ever seemed scared.

We... made it under the first one.

You were clinging to my neck.

1197
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,848
But we got caught
in front of the second.

1198
