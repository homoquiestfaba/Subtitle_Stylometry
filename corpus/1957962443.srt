1
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,020
I've missed you
so much. Did you miss me?

2
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,730
Lactose intolerant.

3
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,720
Booty, booty, booty, booty,
booty, right there. Right there.

4
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,850
Uh, strawberry.

5
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,050
Oh.

6
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,620
Who is this? And what took you so long?

7
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,040
Tenets? It's still in the
money. What's the deal.

8
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,710
Man. I need to go get my
money and buy me out, man.

9
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,990
Kenneth. Hey gay man. This time. It wasn't
my fault. Why are you? The only one?

10
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:47,320
I went to.

11
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:49,809
Jail. So.

12
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,920
Danny tease your faults.
What happened this time, man?

13
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,360
Man, look so check it out,
man. I'm in the club, man.

14
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,490
I walked cool. Okay.

15
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,500
Now I see this female on the dance
floor looking good. So I'm like, ah,

16
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,720
let me go handle my business.

17
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,350
Next thing I
know he whiling out sun

18
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,620
don't give a.

19
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,500
Was that one of your old girls? Oh man.

20
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,750
Security grabbed me. Next thing I
know the cops came and I'm here.

21
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,130
Who are those guys?

22
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,909
It was probably one of his
girls. Your dusty wits. I told.

23
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,770
You about messing with
those wretched chicks.

24
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,510
Josh like your baby mama Kesha, always
getting you caught up in her messiness.

25
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,960
So now you're going to give me
relationship advice, huh? I guarantee you,

26
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:32,970
you was just over there.
Swimming in wet dreams.

27
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,970
Whatever your I'm your mind.

28
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,100
Yeah,

29
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,430
no, grandma

30
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,670
come to this land.

31
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,390
I'd come here for freedom.

32
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,730
I'm bringing with me, my blood, sweat
and tears. I bring with me home.

33
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,430
I bring with me all of my angels
for the most of all I bring with me.

34
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,800
My God can be free.

35
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,410
I look in the theater of my mind
and I see myself wealthy and

36
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:19,700
divine. You see money, money
falling in my hand. And

37
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,250
I keep my samples 30 and strong.

38
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,290
As long as I've done, this
will always have a breath.

39
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,710
Oh,

40
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,190
Hey. What's up, man?

41
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,640
What are you doing here? So Ali,

42
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,280
y'all not supposed to be
out to two o'clock today.

43
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,640
I know prince asked me to come
and work her morning shift.

44
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,020
She said she was running late.

45
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,080
What does this say here? Manager.

46
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,790
Does princess have one of these?
No, but she got a big old booty.

47
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,260
And plus man, it's Friday. You know,
she can meet the colder in one day.

48
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,529
And we need those sales
to stride. But next.

49
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,980
Time, check with me first.
Okay. Hi Dean, man. I got you.

50
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,950
Nice shirt too. Hi.

51
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,510
Laura. Jackie trying to get me a
bi-level jacket in the summertime.

52
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,620
Well, yeah, you want to be the hottest
dude on the block? Don't you pop?

53
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,290
The lid is good though. Right?

54
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,210
If I buy the jacket, you'll
run me your number. Right?

55
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,090
But are you trying to get me in
trouble or water? Cause I mean,

56
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,020
normally my boss doesn't like me to
date customers, but check it out.

57
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,470
You buy a pair of these
designer jeans and a bracelet.

58
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,460
Cause you gotta be, you know, put together
to have everything match and then,

59
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,670
uh, we can figure it out.

60
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,900
What was she trying to have you spin it?

61
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,110
I thought y'all was ballers though.

62
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,020
Cause like you came in here
and you said you was ballers.

63
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:14,180
If you can't afford a pair
of jeans and a bracelet,

64
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,490
then you definitely cannot
afford all. You got that,

65
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,180
then let's do it. Come on.

66
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,180
Boys.

67
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
Apple. One of these
bracelets on there too.

68
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,940
Come on. That's my man. That's my
future's wife right there, man.

69
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,420
We're going to meet so cereals
bread. If you want to start to

70
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,820
think I can handle that. So
let me tell you something.

71
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,210
You've been working here since high school,
but you just make your manager, man.

72
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:03,860
What's that 20,000 a year, man.

73
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:06,701
They're gonna spend more than that
on my ribs and my sound system alone.

74
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,970
You still got the same beat of my school.

75
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,880
Wasn't it like a hole in the floor. We
gotta stop the color crippling song.

76
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,730
Oh, Hey. Hey. We're in immersion
man. I know he heard it.

77
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,760
I ain't never worry about a. Leave by
the check trying to get to the money.

78
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,390
I ain't never worry about a.
Hang on the next getting branch.

79
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,290
When did you get back in town this
morning? I would've called you bro,

80
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,110
but you know how Jacqueline is
when I take them long trips.

81
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,680
Let's just say I had a
lot of catching up to do.

82
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,270
Hey James, are you there?

83
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,190
So I saw you on the cover of F style
last month he was looking fine. Hmm.

84
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,430
Thank you. Thank you. How
you been doing princess?

85
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,380
So you've been keeping that body tight.

86
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,180
You know it's title over five.

87
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,100
So actually I got a copy of the magazine
in the back. Can I get an autograph?

88
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,820
Oh, I got you something. Hey,
can I get a little song too?

89
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,580
Anyway, let me see your phone.

90
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,090
I'll put my number in and maybe
you could help me with my demo.

91
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,520
You'll demo. When did you start singing?

92
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,560
I'll see you later, James. Hey,

93
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,680
you better not let Jacqueline
find that number. Well,

94
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,910
you'll be sleeping in your beds again.
I got this man. Look, she never checks.

95
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,340
Anyway. I just store it on
one of my business contacts.

96
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,710
I know she told her as long as I
keep her laced and Gucci and Prada,

97
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,970
she don't ask no questions.

98
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,770
Let me close up and let's go and
get something to eat on you dog.

99
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,990
Hi man.

100
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,650
Yeah. Okay. I'm on my way. Bla Dee,

101
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:24,550
I gotta get out of here, man.

102
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:28,150
I got some business to take care of. What
are you doing tomorrow? Nothing. Okay,

103
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:30,280

you to check out some tracks.

104
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:34,810
I've been working on what with doing
for us straight up. Yeah. J a dog. Ah.

105
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,860
She wanted to work with your boy too.
Well. Yeah, I'll tell you about it later.

106
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,620
All right then I ain't doing
nothing tomorrow either.

107
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,760
I probably just roll with y'all
all of a sudden you look, boy,

108
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,980
kids are supposed to be seen, not hurt.

109
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,250
He's just playing with UJ. Let him be.

110
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,820
Whatever dog I'm. I'll let
you tomorrow stay up high.

111
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,080
Maybe old fake Drake. I need a one day.

112
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,100
These white girls can get it because
running around here with them.

113
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:23,550

114
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,320
Hey, I'm going to get your
neighbor dog. Oh boy. Don't waste.

115
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:33,060
The time king died so we
can get the booty from every

116
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:35,460
female of every race. Why discriminate?

117
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,800
I'm pretty sure that wasn't quite as
intentions besides I'm not that type.

118
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,060
What? White professional arts leads.

119
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,280
So what are we going to do tonight? Dog?

120
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,590
Not to go to stay inside
and play online checks,

121
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,610
man. You are the loneliest
drives, dude. I know you sure you,

122
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:02,570
my cousin was time. Come on. Hey bro.

123
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,930
It's hot out. You know the
freaks is going to be out today.

124
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,910
I'm saying let's get a couple bottles
and go to the lakefront. I can't.

125
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,800
I have to be up early for church.

126
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,370
Now you killing me with this church stuff
because D church ain't going to help

127
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,170
nobody. You starting act like grandma,
man, with all these revival chunks.

128
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,710
If it wasn't for church or
grandma, you would be dead by now.

129
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,290
Yeah. Yeah. You worried
about that because Hey,

130
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,940
you know what I remember, man,

131
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,390
I remember grandma would wake me up in
the middle of the night Bible in one hand

132
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,600
oil and the other rubbing my forehead,

133
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,560
talking about you can't have
him saying who's him suit.

134
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,270
I remember how she used to walk
around the house. Casting out demons.

135
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,820
Holy ghost Jesus. She loved us.

136
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,150
Yeah.

137
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,570
It should be like Deshawn God doesn't
care about the money you bring in.

138
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,210
All that matters is the
love you give up. You sir.

139
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,490
Hello Kenneth.

140
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,500
So tell me how does a poser
like you get named Chicago

141
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,610
hottest producer. Is that hate
out here in your voice? Hey,

142
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,950
ain't nobody hating homie.

143
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,910
I just can't understand how somebody from
the burbs know so much about the hood.

144
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,510
So I see you did remark,

145
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,070
I guess you didn't know that real
hood dudes carried, huh? Nah.

146
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,120
It's not that I just figured you wouldn't
have had the time since you were busy

147
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,490
in the county jail dropping
the soap. Well Jay,

148
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,930
tell us about working with Jay Hart.
Yeah, man. So let me get an eight.

149
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,940
She wanted to get what you did see?
Why are you always on my case? Kenny,

150
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,800
do I intimidate? You intimidate me, man.

151
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:33,490
I can't stand you what's
so uppity, you thick,

152
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,120
grimy as hell. Your tracks are terrible.

153
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,750
And the only reason why you treating Dee
like that is because he ain't gonna man

154
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:44,380
up and put you in your place.
It was not like that. No. What?

155
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:49,060
I get it now I get it. I can understand
why you would be jealous of me.

156
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,680
I mean, here I am. Chicago's
number one, super producer.

157
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,860
Here you are a low level. Dope boy.

158
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,210
And it's looking like your time is almost
up. Are you threatening? No, no, no.

159
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:04,780
Stop. Stop, stop. Stop. Just sit
down. Sit down dead. Come on.

160
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,030
Uh,

161
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,510
I don't know.

162
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:29,050
All right. Excuse me. Hello?

163
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,640
Hi. I'm I'm kinda lost. Can
one of you help me? Yes,

164
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,510
I can help him. Whatever
it is. You're looking for.

165
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,000
Susan, my driver. Isn't very good
with directions or English. Okay.

166
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,970
What's the address? It's 2, 3, 4 forest.

167
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,280
Hey, ain't that? The Johnson
across the street. Yeah.

168
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,980
Mr. Johnson. He's an
army buddy of my dad's.

169
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:03,650
Talking about crazy yellow side cots.
Doesn't put all past to body alarm.

170
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:04,651
Mr. Johnson.

171
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,630
No. Mr. Johnson moved out
two months ago. I see you.

172
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:10,160
Don't check up on your old neighbors.

173
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,320
Well, I can check up on you neighbor, bro.

174
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,870
You don't even stay around
here with so thirsty.

175
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,150
You look familiar. Don't
I know you from somewhere.

176
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,710
Well, if you can read,

177
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:27,830
you probably saw me featured on
the cover of lifestyle magazine.

178
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:33,710
Oh yeah. That's it. You don't look
hardcore gangster to me though.

179
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,060
I guess you can read. Well,

180
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,390
I guess I'll be seeing you at the black
parties or something. My neighbor.

181
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,830
I think she liked you. Cause man, please.

182
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,280
She ain't nothing but another group
chicken to make him look, give me a week.

183
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,870
I have a tattoo on my name
on it that watch once again,

184
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:04,760
Haiti now, you know well she
was spilling cuss, not discern,

185
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,090
you know, a woman like that
is too much for your party.

186
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,740
I mean you can lend us some sugar
or something. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

187
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,590
She's out of my league.
Grimy is hail. Whatever, man.

188
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,240
Hey look the ride with me up
north man. I got to hear a point.

189
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,310
You little girl scout. Don't
send me hair cut appointment.

190
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,900
No I don't do walk-ins
boss has made the point.

191
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Cloud

192
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,290
Oh, come your momma's baby.

193
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,470
Daddy.

194
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,650
No. And I'm sorry ma'am I didn't
mean to disturb you.

195
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:49,600
You didn't stirred me sugar.
Is that an air conditioner?

196
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,100
Yes ma'am it is. Show is strong.

197
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,550
I wish I had a strong grandson. Like you.

198
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,420
Take care of it right now.

199
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,890
This show is hot. I wish I had
money for an air conditioner.

200
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,100
I don't know how I'm
going to take this heat.

201
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,940
There you go. This should help with the
air conditioner and the delivery cost.

202
00:21:29,941 --> 00:21:30,690
Okay.

203
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:35,610
Oh, thank you so much problem. No problem.

204
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:39,780
It's going to do great things for you in
your life. You just watch watches. See?

205
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,190
Ooh.

206
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,410
My grandmother used to tell
me the same thing. So look,

207
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:48,366
I'm gonna come back and make
sure they installed it right.

208
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,160
And then you'll be good to go. Okay? Okay.

209
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,230
Thank you. Bless you. God bless you.

210
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,960
You gotta stop coming to these clubs.

211
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,920
I'm talking about it's this new
club down on Ontario called light

212
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,460
blue man.

213
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,030
So you're a fan.

214
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,090
Well, uh, let's see. I'll come
back and make you a fan of the JB.

215
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,260
Fan club. I don't think
my husband and like that.

216
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,550
So don't tell him have
a good day, Mr. Banner.

217
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,390
Man, a better man. A
better dude. It's only.

218
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,990
For one super producer

219
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,770
where you want to know
what I'm thinking about.

220
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,710
Doormats. Yeah, babe.

221
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,700
Do you remember last week at the big
momma shopping for those pink shower

222
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,330
curtains? She's always talking
about. So when I was checking out,

223
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,370
I saw they had a sale on
personalized doormat, Tiana.

224
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,190
What's so special about doormats. Cool.

225
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,560
When you love to come home to see
the Harrison's and our doorstep.

226
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,010
Homo with the mayor stuff again.
See, I thought we were good on that.

227
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:49,070
Okay. We good? I just, I don't want
our son growing up without a father.

228
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,700
I ain't going nowhere.
I know that. It's just,

229
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,760
I need more from you than just
being my man or my baby daddy.

230
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,640
I want your last name, Kenny.

231
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,540
You know that only comes with marriage.

232
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,100
I'm not the myriad type of dude.

233
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,520
And if you're not okay with
that, then that's on you.

234
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,610
Honey. I am in love with you. Don't you
realize I would do anything for you.

235
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:25,130
Now I'm asking for one thing and that's
for us to do things the right way.

236
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,140
What is this? What.

237
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:29,989
Is the right way? What
is the right way to, you.

238
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,310
Know, I was raised in church. My parents
hate the fact you got me pregnant.

239
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:38,000
Didn't marry me. Do you even
know what big mama calls you?

240
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,880
The boy that I'm shacking up with?
How do you think that makes me feel

241
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,150
in my heart? I noticed
is not right. You can,

242
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:54,140
when we have sex, I
feel so bad afterwards.

243
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,750
So this life ain't good enough for
you, huh? I'm never saying that.

244
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,290
All I'm saying is we would have so much
more if we just did things. God's way.

245
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,950
Look at Chrissy and Josh. All
right, listen Christmas. Every,

246
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:14,690
since they got married, they
built a house from the ground up.

247
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,350
He got a promotion at work.
She had started home business.

248
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,350
You know what? Ever since you started
hanging with your college friends,

249
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
you've been acting all.

250
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,710
Josh and Chris, Chris and Josh, are you
trying to impress them with something.

251
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,610
Bougie? Bougie can. So,

252
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:38,570
because I want to do things the right
way and I want us to be a real family.

253
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,860
I'm trying to impress somebody.

254
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,210
You never had a problem with this before.

255
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,940
You know what? I ain't
trying to find the. Shut up,

256
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,630
shut up and help me on.

257
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,370
Oh man. I told him about messing
with him. It's the whole.

258
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,940
Man. He gassed up over this dude. Six
just moved in across the street from,

259
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,250
I told me when I had to get his weight up.

260
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:12,310
If you want to mess with these
young bops out here, man,

261
00:26:12,311 --> 00:26:15,760
she got them going like that already.
Shorted him. Ain't going like that.

262
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,090
She going to be more than just a three
piece dinner. You feel, man? You know,

263
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,260
I go, man, man, what they want,
bro? I keep telling them that.

264
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,470
I just don't think he ready to
compete with the big boy here. Boy.

265
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,620
Gonna need some help. Tell me about it.

266
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,260
Freaking Kesha, Kesha.

267
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:48,390
Ah, I ain't got to tell him
to play these games with you.

268
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,490
What?

269
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,260
GC? No. I'm picking up my son tomorrow.

270
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,500
Well, okay. Okay. Keisha, Keisha,

271
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,730
what is she born in is Chiesa
she don't need much of a reason.

272
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,010
Oh, so why did you go over there?

273
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,950
She calls and you just go run it.

274
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,360
You know what I told you?
I'm through with that girl.

275
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,850
I'm going to get my son and I'm done.

276
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,190
You need to get a paternity test.

277
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,010
You know she was sleeping with half
the block on the house together.

278
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,880
Tiana. Hi Nana, move for that right now.
How are you going to take care of him?

279
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,130
You already ended up the house
all day long. Me and little Ken.

280
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,870
Barely get to see you as it is.

281
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,479
I don't know. I'll figure it out.

282
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,020
But for right now I got to get
him away from her. Crazy behind

283
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,910
you can bring them over here.

284
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,330
What?

285
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,800
Come here, baby. Come here.

286
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,240
I love you so much. No enough tomorrow.

287
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,590
But he don't need to be living
in that type of environment.

288
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:24,650
Especially with Keisha. She can barely
even take care of her. Other three kids,

289
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,910
whatever.

290
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,550
Let me go get my boy.

291
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,470
I'll talk to you later. It's about
to get into our blood go bed.

292
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,310
Well, Jacqueline was out of
town on another photo shoot.

293
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:07,190
I'm about to take this little group
and. I met at the mall back, Stacey,

294
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:10,580
my number one fan. So
I'm about to find out,

295
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,150
be careful with bringing
those girls a house.

296
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,190
And I guess I'm a master
player been doing this.

297
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,970
You've just gone in there and worried
that one of them little freaky dreams,

298
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,450
Elisa. I don't have to worry about
super gonorrhea, whatever man.

299
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,420
Yes.

300
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,290
Around with a superstar. I'll
show you all around this town.

301
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,900
I'll take a rain check on that offer.

302
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,870
I see you are concerned
about your neighbors.

303
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:03,110
What is this? Are you trying to
get rid of evidence or something?

304
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,500
Yeah, I wouldn't use
battery acid, but I ran out.

305
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,720
Plus the attic was occupied with
all my wheat plants. Yeah. So.

306
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,820
How's everything coming along.

307
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,110
It's coming, but it's nothing like
the apartment I had back in New York.

308
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,630
You lived in New York. Yeah,

309
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,110
but the money was real tight
and jobs were hard to come by.

310
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,880
So here I am.

311
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,290
It is. I used to travel around a lot,

312
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,760
but I moved back here because my grandma
needed support. I thought she retired.

313
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,230
She needed help paying him.

314
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,020
That's so sweet of you. You know,

315
00:30:39,021 --> 00:30:41,840
most men are more interested in
helping themselves than others.

316
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,800
Maybe I'll step out and
be here one day. Well.

317
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,670
She's usually in and out of the hospital
a lot. That's where she's at right now.

318
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,459
I think answer kind.

319
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,630
Of size shoe got applied. Knees, flooded
people kind of got you and brick.

320
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,310
Girl. No can be hard. That's
why I'm staying up. Beautiful.

321
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,560
So what are you doing when you're
not being such a state? I've.

322
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,340
Heard of MDB apparel say big glue.

323
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,200
They store all the malls in Chicago.

324
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:17,390
I managed to have that and
I also helped James out

325
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:21,710
with his checks. Matter of fact, you
know that check with Jennifer Hudson.

326
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,600
I I'm working on it. So
right now for real, yes.

327
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,670
And the beats that was on call
most favorite joints, I made it.

328
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,580
I would love to get into music. Seeing.

329
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,360
Dan's act, anything that has to do
with the arts. I love that stuff.

330
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,170
That's what I was doing back in New
York. Trying to break into the business.

331
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,890
No I'm originally from Brazil.

332
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,890
Well, according to the
rest of America I am,

333
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,340
but my mom is Brazilian and
my dad was a soldier station.

334
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:02,780
There he is born and raised in
Chicago. Mr. Johnson was his godfather.

335
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,850
So why does shy?

336
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,510
I don't know. Mr. Johnson's
letting me stay here. Rent free.

337
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:12,530
So maybe I'll get a job. I'm
just trying to keep busy.

338
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,990
I'm really just waiting on
destiny to reveal itself to me on.

339
00:32:17,991 --> 00:32:20,420
So then maybe I'll just
check out the sites.

340
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,150
And I'd be happy to show
you around. You know?

341
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,920
I wouldn't want you to get lost
in Chicago is a very big place.

342
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,770
I like that. I like that a lot.

343
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,610
No, you came to us at the right time.

344
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,880

It's so about the heat, right? No,

362
00:34:24,941 --> 00:34:29,760

What are you doing here?

374
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,920
He must have thought I was one of
your jump off of something, huh?

375
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:37,060
Well, my son had keys. He met
where you bet. Well what about me?

376
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,140
You though.

377
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:44,630
Stop right there. As soon
as I get my son, I'm out.

378
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,520
No.

379
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:49,730
I am. When you know
well, you still want me?

380
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,290
You can just walk away from all
of this. I know how to get. Right?

381
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,800
Are you deaf or something?
I don't want you Kesha.

382
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,490
It's too late for that. We
got a son together, man.

383
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,570
And that's all we got and I'm
in the right amount to take him,

384
00:36:08,571 --> 00:36:12,350
to get a paternity test
too. Uh, better yet.

385
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,070
Give me the money because they're
going to tell him that he's yours.

386
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,650
You're sick. You better hope so. Because
if I find out that you lied to me,

387
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,070
Kesha, I'll swell.

388
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,900
Well you going to work? You
going to hit me, hit me.

389
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:31,670
I go black bro. I'm in jail.
Don't just go get my son.

390
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,500
He ain't here.

391
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,670
So where's yet have my mama's
with the rest of my kids.

392
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,280
Kesha. I don't have time to
play these games with you.

393
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,360
I'm coming to get my son tomorrow.

394
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:53,510
You got time for me now. And
daddy, you just don't get it.

395
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,660
Do you.

396
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,140
All set a little lame. You
messing with me. Oh yeah.

397
00:37:00,141 --> 00:37:04,910
I know you was at her house when I
called you earlier and you must think I'm

398
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:08,480
crazy. If you think I'm a, let
my son go with you in that Huck.

399
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,500
What you going to do with that?

400
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,310
It ain't like you trying
to do right by him anyway.

401
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,360
Besides she's a better
mother than you ever be.

402
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,170
I let my baby go to the state.
Before I let them go with your bum.

403
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,000
You better kill my lame to watch her back.

404
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,790
You come near my family.
I'm going to kill you with

405
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,820
no, I like it. Rough salt
is seriously wrong with you

406
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,460
crazier.

407
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,330
Me,

408
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,080
me down for me to

409
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,510
quit my thirst. I was thirsty.

410
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:03,130
What I'm feeling. It's
the truth. Truth, shape and mold.

411
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,180
Cause I'm married to it,
man. I don't want to do it.

412
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,350
Be Fisher, be sacrificial.

413
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,390
I want to talk to y'all about
something. Something very important.

414
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,360
I want to talk to y'all about

415
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,510
. Your

416
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:56,530
be the person that you think has your
best interests to be your boss at the

417
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:57,531
job.

418
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,050
I hate to even be your
very own blood rose.

419
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
Hey man.

420
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,100
Come here, man.

421
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:21,000
There was a report of gunshots around
here. Did you know anything about it?

422
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:25,560
Homey, man, this is the shot,
right? I hit gunshots all the time.

423
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,010
Well watch yourself.
Somebody people out tonight.

424
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
Got you later.

425
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,440
Tiana. And these doormats.

426
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,180
Which, which one do you think the red
or the black? I'm thinking a black one.

427
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,020
No, no.

428
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,510
I got up flat out of
town tonight to go to LA

429
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,190
I booked that
F style magazine shoot.

430
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,040
The one I had the test
shot file last weekend.

431
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,920
Congratulations. But then.

432
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,840
Okay. Well clearly some
people think I'm marketable.

433
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,270
You leave me all the time.

434
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,560
Oh my baby. Be missing me.

435
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,030
Hey baby.

436
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:57,230
That's what happens when you have
a model for a life? I fly here.

437
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:01,460
I fly there. Besides that
we'll be giving you grief.

438
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,960
When you be on going out of town
and your business trips for two,

439
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,210
three weeks at a time. Yeah.

440
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,470
Because taking a picture,

441
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,960
don't bring in the sort of
income that I bring to the table.

442
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,340
You know what, whatever James,

443
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,560
how about this?

444
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:21,670
How about I see in junior to my
mom's house while I'm out of town,

445
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:26,170
that way you could continue to
bring in all that money to me.

446
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,260
How about that?

447
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,500
And while I'm over here being funny,
I see a phone over there blowing up.

448
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,080
I know you better not have
gave y'all number two,

449
00:42:38,081 --> 00:42:42,130
another one that they were groupie
checks. Come on that day. You know,

450
00:42:42,131 --> 00:42:43,411
I wouldn't do nothing like that.

451
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,310
I'm too busy trying to give you
the life. You can only dream up.

452
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:53,440
I ain't got time to be chasing
no gold duty plus I'm too tired.

453
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,890
I ain't got no energy to be given
his love in a way you keep me drain.

454
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,420
Yeah, I hope that's the truth, James.

455
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,330
I'm not with no more cheating.

456
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,190
I don't know whatever you want to do.

457
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,220
And that's why I created the
paint, the world project.

458
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:22,420
Now that's what's up. So tell us,
why did you start your own label?

459
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,500
Not, I just got tired of record labels
getting rich off of my hard work.

460
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:30,190
So I cut out the middleman and
now I'm making my own money.

461
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,740
So are you telling us
it's all about the money.

462
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:36,880
Now? I wouldn't really say it's all
about the money. It's more about destiny.

463
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:41,320
You see I've been in this industry a
long time and so I've had the opportunity

464
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,150
to work with a lot of key players.

465
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,510
So when the opportunity presented
itself to me, of course,

466
00:43:46,511 --> 00:43:49,060
I jumped on it and now I'm my own boss.

467
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:53,230
Now that is what I'm talking
about. When we come back,

468
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,220
we're going to have an amazing
artist for Daryl. Tell us political.

469
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:01,450
Yo, we got Mike in the misfits
and David's y'all stay tuned.

470
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:05,530
James man. Okay.

471
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:14,289
Hey Clive. How are you as banner?
Great. Great. Hey, are you.

472
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,610
Still looking to start that
streaming label in the Midwest?

473
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,500
I think I can help you with that.

474
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,470
Okay. Just give me a little time. I
got some talent I can showcase for you.

475
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,110
If you like it. We can
talk about that label.

476
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,480
Sounds good. Okay. Glad. All right.

477
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
Talk to you later.

478
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,900
Let's get this money, baby.

479
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,450
Like everything was going wrong.

480
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,430
Trying so hard to find

How's that going? It's
been brutal. Come on now.

I mean, don't get me wrong. I've ran
across a lot of talented singers out here,

487
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:55,390
but see singing is not the only thing
that you need to create a superstar.

488
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,930
I mean, you've got to have the it
factor. You know what I'm saying?

489
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:04,120
The F factor. I feel you on
that. So Mr. Super producer,

Well, I'll be holding tryouts at
the spot on 17th street. So ladies,

492
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,680
if you've got the it factor, come on now.

493
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,710

Chicago's next superstar.

west side of Chicago.

510
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:08,790
This is my first time doing anything
like this. So I'm a little bit nervous,

511
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:09,791
but here it goes.

512
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:21,780

So

516
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,040
You still haven't carpeted Sean yet?

517
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,540

00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,230

519
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:39,309
You are the one who said he hasn't
had a girl since what? High.

520
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:42,189
School he's just making up.

00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:46,570
For lost time. What's the

523
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:05,770
don't worry about it and you let him

524
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:12,310
decide he is going to work.

525
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:40,900
What's your attitude out here

526
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,390
when you come to this event.

527
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,780
But you can go now.

528
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:02,630
You know what?

529
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:13,630
None of my food. And if I catch you
upstairs, wandering around again.

530
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,790
What's up. How you doing? What's going
on? I'm just cataloging like a Jay Z.

531
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:32,460
I'm just trying to set the
mood. So what about this?

532
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,170
High-tech you've been
telling me of now. You know,

533
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:38,070

clapped to hear about a fire. Well,

534
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:40,560
she's upstairs getting ready,
but well worth the wait.

535
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:45,120
I mean this girl could be the next Alicia
key guy. We'll see about that. Okay.

536
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,090
Well you go ahead and enjoy the view.
I'm going to go talk to the guests.

537
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:49,150
I see you later.

538
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,250
Okay. This is such a nice house.

539
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:06,590
Yeah. We used to live in a house
just like this one. Really? Yes. Nah,

540
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,710
but I have to sell it. So I move
in with my grandma. You know?

541
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:16,280
What the hell have you been, man? I've
called you five times. Feel guilt, man.

542
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:16,370
I.

543
00:54:16,371 --> 00:54:19,730
Don't want that family dollar wine.
Listen, I needed you here at four.

544
00:54:19,731 --> 00:54:22,759
O'clock not 405, not 430, 4.

545
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,160
O'clock I'm sorry. It's my money.
Trying to get none of that.

546
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:29,149
My talent is already ready.
All I need you to do is keep.

547
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:33,200
An eye out on this etiquette and you
don't eat all my food up. Don't worry.

548
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,560
You invited them. So you watch. I got you.

549
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,360
Can I have everyone's
attention please? First of all,

550
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:47,630
I like to say you guys look amazing today.

551
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,510
Thank you very much for
cooperating with the dress code.

552
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:53,390
You look very good and
you're all white, uh,

553
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:56,980
like to get this show started though.
We got a real treat for you today.

554
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:00,920
So as you know, I've been a
music producer since high school,

555
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:06,380
I've worked with salads, such
as usher, 50 cent J hood,

556
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,880
and always beautiful. At
least the key, but lately.

557
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,490
Stopped drinking the champagne ed.

558
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:20,210
Ah, lately I've been working with my
own artists. So I got to tell you,

559
00:55:20,211 --> 00:55:25,130
I'm very excited to introduce
to you a hot new young sat out

560
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:30,380
straight out of Chicago. So you got
to give us some shots down. Look, uh,

561
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,040
this young lady auditioned for me
about three weeks ago and she lit it.

562
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,370
So I know you won't be disappointed. Also.

563
00:55:37,371 --> 00:55:39,971
I like to give a shout out to my
boyfriend. There were over there.

564
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,340
He's got a hot track for you
guys. You're in for a real treat.

565
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:46,190
So without further ado,

566
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,769
please give a warm welcome for Ms..
Oh wow. I'm sorry. I never made

567
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:49,770
it on the floor. Hold up.

568
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:41,880
Hey, how y'all doing? Hi.

569
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:45,180
It looks like we are experiencing
a little technical difficulties.

570
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:49,840
I told her do not eat that guacamole
on this heat until y'all messed me up.

571
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,420
So if anybody's gonna use the bathroom,
please not look at the master bathroom.

572
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,590
What the hell was that?

573
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,810
I can't do this. I can't go out
there. I thought I was ready, but I.

574
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:08,070
You thought you were ready. You
came to the audition to be a singer.

575
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:12,000
What did you think? This was
a fashion show. Well, went to

576
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,510
Tufts on black news. He just kind of
killing me. I feel like guy wrote me.

577
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,120
Just everything. Okay.

578
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:25,980
I just, I'm never saying it's
one of this many people before.

579
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,710
Singled that never sang go figure. I
knew I should've picked that white girl.

580
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:32,940
I gotta be getting pumped.

581
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,500
I'll go out there and warm up the crowd.

582
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:38,911
That way maybe I could break the ice
and you'll feel more comfortable.

583
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,180
Let me get this straight.
You're saying too.

584
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,510
Boy. Cause she C she kind of seemed
like I Rita Franklin. I sweat.

585
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:53,230
Over there to make you like,
I don't even know what a

586
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:58,676
was. When my mama was
trying to do my little hotel for school,

587
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,420
but you want to go outside of Blake.
So she gave her quick fun. Dude.

588
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:06,420
Just want me, you can do that for
me. That I'll do it for the shot.

589
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:09,870
Well, whatever. Hey, the shot,

590
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:13,530
the little neighbor friend better come
through and you gotta get your act

591
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:17,100
together. Your future depends on.
I got a lot of money right now.

592
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,420
Okay. Can I get everyone's
attention please?

593
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:32,040
I'm just so embarrassed.
I can't believe happened.

594
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,190
Jasmine's and crowd pleaser.

595
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,610
She's a lifesaver. The thing
about that, it's the dress.

596
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,420
You see, everything will be all
right. I have another young lady here.

597
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,410
She has some amazing
vocals and y'all know me.

598
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:50,160
I love to give people opportunities.
So with no further ado,

599
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,510
please give a warm
welcome Mrs. Desire. Woo.

600
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,660
Thank you. So tonight I
want to think on that.

601
00:59:06,661 --> 00:59:11,550

person. It's called thesis.

602
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:15,830
Oh, I love it.

603

That's it right there. Let me see

You tried to take my man and now
you're trying to take my fun. See?

612
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,640
I'm not happy.

613
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,360
I didn't say Kenneth.

614
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:21,060
He left and Jamari is, can you sound too?

So with, he wants to see his son.
He has every right to fuchsia.

voice like that. I didn't know.

Wow. Can I get an autograph now?

648
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,390
You can get more than that.

649
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,460
Okay? Okay. A little bit.

You agree? Thank you. You

655
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:32,760
You. And James, I'm sorry. Things didn't
work out. I mean that's never happened.

656
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:37,350
Oh, it's quite all right, because uh,
I've decided to work with you after all.

657
01:05:37,351 --> 01:05:41,070
So you want to meet me up in my
room? We can uh, work out the detail.

658
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:46,140
Okay. And maybe you can look up
later. Yes. Show me some foreigners.

659
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:49,390
Of course. I'll call
you later. Okay? Okay.

660
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:55,980
Yeah. What about Jacqueline?
Where is she? Ah,

661
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:59,310
she's out of town in the Caribbean
again doing another photo. Shoot.

662
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,200
She won't be back for another three weeks.

663
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:05,370
But I'll be careful with that
girl. Not playing with fire.

664
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,830
Listen, man. Let the grown folks worry
about wrong folks. It's all right.

665
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,630
As for you, Ms. Desire,

666
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:15,390
we only got a couple of weeks
to get ready for class David.

667
01:06:15,391 --> 01:06:17,490
So I'm going to need you for a focus,

668
01:06:17,491 --> 01:06:21,540
meaning less attention on the shine here
and more attention on me in the studio.

669
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:25,890
I think I can handle that and
Deshaun you wouldn't mind, right?

670
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,760
Right. No problem.

671
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:34,470
Okay. Okay. Cool. All right.
Well, uh, I'll be in touch.

672
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,910
Keep that body together.
Hey Sean, do me a solid man.

673
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:43,020
Once you clean up around here, I
gotta go concentrate this contract.

674
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:51,810
Yeah. Can I have a nice ring to it?

675
01:06:55,410 --> 01:07:00,000
Walter shave went. Hey, who gonna
pay for me for tonight? Huh? Okay.

676
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,340
So now you hear me. Hi.

677
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:06,180
I'm taking everything else
since it was already free.

678
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,730
Look at me and my mama
gonna eat this for lunch.

679
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:55,950
Hey, D can I go home early? I don't care.

680
01:07:56,820 --> 01:08:00,690
I come when I was two weeks. What's
up, man. Can you be yourself? Libby?

681
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,670
Do you think your boy James
is trying to smash Jasmine,

682
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:11,220
come on, come on.

683
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:14,760
We talking about the same dude that bring
girls over to his wife's house while

684
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:19,690
she out of town. That guy
James I'm like brother. Okay.

685
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:30,280
I think I'm just missing Jasmine.
I've never met a girl before.

686
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:35,230
She's the first catheter. Since high
school, you gotta be kidding me.

687
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,701
The next you're going to be
telling me that you were hurt.

688
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:44,740
Big. You ain't happy since it had you.

689
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:49,210
No, you fool. I'm not a vegan.
That's just been a long time.

690
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,730
Five years. Oh yeah man.
He'll version in my book.

691
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:56,450
When was the last time you had to go.

692
01:08:56,950 --> 01:09:00,970
Last week? Remember to cross out a
chick? Yeah. She came over to the crib.

693
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,470
We started rapping. And that's
how it happened for you.

694
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:11,150
Have you tried with Jasmine? I mean,
do you even still know how to do it?

695
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:13,000
Because you know you, you still that'd be.

696
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:17,240
I will have you walking here every
weekend until you're 35. Keep talking.

697
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:18,820
Hey man, I'm just playing. God.

698
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:23,320
No, I haven't tried anything with
Jasmine yet. I'm waiting on your rights.

699
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:28,240
Well check your watch every time.
It's the right time. Summer, spring,

700
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,300
fall five o'clock in the
morning Groundhog day Lee.

701
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:34,930
The first day she came to my house
would have been the right time.

702
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:39,880
See you don't rush things like that.
When you want to build something real.

703
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:46,540
Wild animals can just have sex. And I
would have had monkey sex with Hutchins.

704
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,250
I don't even think about
sex when I'm with Jasmine

705
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:02,230
scammy, not doll. I'm telling you

706
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:08,410
this girl is something special
when I'm retired. It's like,

707
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:13,660
I don't think about anybody else. It's
like the only two people in the world.

708
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:18,790
I knew nothing else. My Tufts
don't care that I am broke.

709
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:21,940
Well, you better start caring.
Cause she blowing up. Dude.

710
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,360
She not going to be ran on a
bus. I mean think about it.

711
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,440
She want to ride in a hot ride
on sitting on them. Things.

712
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:32,620
She around all them superstars
and celebrities. And you know,

713
01:10:32,621 --> 01:10:35,141
the big time is going to be hitting
that ain't be got her heels.

714
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:38,716
You don't think she wanted them girls
to try to use what she got to gives you

715
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:42,160
one, because if you do, I mean, you
might as well have sex with her now,

716
01:10:42,161 --> 01:10:45,010
before it's too late and you know what?

717
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:49,600
I can hide in the closet and
record the whole thing. And I mean,

718
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:52,810
you can have a sex tape late. He was
left with a box and get your son.

719
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,970
He is scared to walk. Now you food.

720
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,520
I'm just saying I could hide to
walk now and worked for Kim K

721
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:03,470
boy.

722
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:26,610
Sir. She has recovered from surfing needs
to rest. You're going to have to leave

723
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,240
because you've got 10
minutes and that's it.

724
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:39,250
Baby.

725
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,820
Promised what happened.

726
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:53,370
It was Kesha. She was following me. Can't.

727
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,650
Shut up talking crazy.

728
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,450
I left.

729
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,720
I went to the car to puck a little kid.

730
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:14,100
She came out of nowhere. She's staffed.

731
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:19,180
Wait in front of Boston

732
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:34,450
upset.

733
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:41,190
She is not worth you.
Going back to jail over

734
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:50,100
to say the police investigated,
going to investigate.

735
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,560
Wait,

736
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:00,970
I need to tell him,

737
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:20,970
please cut. Please protect him.

738
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,450
Doesn't know what he's doing

739
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,010
up.

740
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,040
Well, now that we're going
to be working together.

741
01:13:35,090 --> 01:13:38,090
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page. Okay?

742
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:43,400
So now that you're about to be famous. Oh,

743
01:13:43,401 --> 01:13:46,880
you ain't gonna have no boyfriend.
Right? Why do you say that?

744
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:48,700
Where do I begin?

745
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:53,390
I'm going to be doing show network events.

746
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:58,460
I mean on the road and the studio doesn't
have a lot on your plate and I know

747
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:01,220
Sean, he's not going
to be ready for all of.

748
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,480
Is that.

749
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:07,520
Look, all I'm saying is now
that you're about to take over.

750
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,850
You might want to consider
the other options.

751
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:16,360
I hate to break it to you, but
the sun is just not your tight.

752
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:22,780
He works a mall job. I mean he barely
makes 25 K a year for Christ's sake.

753
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,630
He still lives in his grandmother's house.

754
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,930
His car alone is an
embarrassment all in itself.

755
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:31,820
You don't want to be seen
with a guy like that.

756
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,760
Not for the level that you're about to
be on. It's just not a good look for you.

757
01:14:36,761 --> 01:14:37,761
And.

758
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:42,670
So what type of guy do you
think I should be with a boss?

759
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,950
Someone that can take care of you
financially as well as section

760
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:54,040
is that Sean wouldn't know what
to do with all that. I didn't,

761
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:58,770
even if I told him myself, oh really?
What you need is a real man's man.

762
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:04,420
Somebody like me, it's
just not natural for a boy.

763
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:07,300
Like the shine to be
with a woman like you.

764
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:13,540
Okay, I get it. So because
you have money and status,

765
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:15,870
then I should want to be
with somebody like you.

766
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,930
And because Dishon is just an average guy,

767
01:15:19,931 --> 01:15:22,180
then it's not right for
me to want to be with him.

768
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,160
I don't make the rules,
but I just play the game.

769
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:32,170
He just got it all figured
out. Don't you it's my job.

770
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:36,550
You were about to be the next
biggest thing coming out of the shot.

771
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:39,110
So I think it's time
we turn it up at night.

772
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:42,520
So tonight it's all about you and me.

773
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:48,520
But do you have plans?
We'll do a little shopping.

774
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:53,410
Go to the spa hair, done
nails done. You know,

775
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:58,060
I like the sound of it. And after that,

776
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:03,430
who knows what two consenting
adults may get into.

777
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:13,890
Tell me, you love me. Love me.

778
01:16:13,891 --> 01:16:17,550
I want to hear Craig.

779
01:16:17,551 --> 01:16:19,050
You know how I feel about you?

780
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:25,730
You're still messing with
that. Goofy. Want to know this?

781
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:29,040
This right here. This mind you, my baby.

782
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,370
I said Jess,

783
01:16:32,371 --> 01:16:36,420
because I let you hit does not
mean I'm your baby or your girl.

784
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,640
She a lie. You will be.

785
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:42,870
Kenneth is mommy.

786
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:48,120
And he's coming back to me now
until then all you is a good

787
01:16:48,121 --> 01:16:52,770
way. Just enjoy the ride.
Why you paying? Okay.

788
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:59,520
Look, if I catch buddy over
here, I'm stretching them out.

789
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:05,010
No that whatever boy you're so scary.

790
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:07,590
I ain't got nobody out.

791
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:13,610
Open up, man.

792
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:01,620
Come on and get up.

793
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:07,480
You want some smoke? Huh?

794
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,570
All right. Bobby girl,
Steven Powell, shorty.

795
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:20,620
I'll get it together the right way, man.
What you about to do, man? I'm not, no.

796
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:25,210
Give me something to eat then
I'm decent. You know what?

797
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,020
As a matter of fact,

798
01:18:26,021 --> 01:18:29,181
slammed my uncle Raymond's or give me a
G pain because when I get done with her,

799
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:33,700
I'll be hungry. Then that thing, man,
that I slide on me about like, oh.

800
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:38,349
Man, you know you immediate,
man, man, stop, man.

801
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:40,150
Would you, I'm gonna
give you that one though.

802
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:59,290
Let me see your hand. Let me see
your hands. I didn't do nothing.

803
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:06,530
Then I don't have nothing

804
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,020
Told. Y'all get your hobby.

805
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,460
Can I make my phone call.

806
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:20,900
Please, please.

807
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,210
My girl is in the hospital. I just
need to make a phone call to my cousin.

808
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:30,290
That's all. Thank you.

809
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,030
D what took you so long, man?

810
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:43,160
I've been busy.

811
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:47,510
Man. Tiana. Is that what happened?

812
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,320
Kaisa crazy. Stabbed her in front of my,

813
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:54,169
she stabbed Teyana in front of my son.

814
01:20:54,170 --> 01:20:58,310
Man. I did. All right, but it don't matter
to you though. Huh? What do you mean?

815
01:20:58,311 --> 01:20:59,390
It doesn't matter to me.

816
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:03,140
Because we blood with cousins,
with family. Where were you?

817
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:06,620
I've been spending time with my,
besides I ain't going to mind.

818
01:21:06,621 --> 01:21:09,620
I don't need to hold
your hand. Right? Right.

819
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:14,150
Well, why you supposedly with your girl?
Tell me why she out there with James.

820
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:17,480
You don't know what you're talking about.

821
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:21,280
James is working very hard
to help her grow up. No.

822
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,500
She, Mrs.

823
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:26,870
Closeup got dropped off earlier this
evening with a bunch of bags that she got

824
01:21:26,871 --> 01:21:27,871
from James.

825
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:32,270
Oh, it's not like that.
Jasmine is an aspiring artists.

826
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:37,400
I gems is starting his own record label.
He's even going to sign up to a deal.

827
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:41,840
He's showcasing her tomorrow at
this spot for some music execs.

828
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:45,350
The son. You're not listening, man.

829
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:51,050
What's she got your nose
wide open first and foremost.

830
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:54,350
Think about it. Who doesn't
know who peanut head James is?

831
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:59,150
Everybody knows who he is. She act like
she didn't so she could get it to man.

832
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:05,300
She can still find her way inside
with him. Don't you get it? She got,

833
01:22:05,301 --> 01:22:08,929
you want him off a square and you over
here struggling over some basic chick who.

834
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:12,350
Does this man, just because I'm
not a drug dealer. Like you,

835
01:22:12,351 --> 01:22:13,340
she doesn't want to be with.

836
01:22:13,341 --> 01:22:15,560
Me. Don't don't do that, man.

837
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:17,390
You know they recording these phone calls.

838
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:21,170
I'll talk to you later. I
hope that. All right, bye.

839
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:32,210
Hello? Hey daddy. What's wrong with you?

840
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:34,520
Nothing just busy.

841
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:35,331
Okay.

842
01:22:35,332 --> 01:22:38,690
Well there's something that's been on my
mind that I want to talk to you about.

843
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:39,680
Hey.

844
01:22:39,681 --> 01:22:41,630
Let's go. Jazz. Time is money.

845
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:47,240
I was just saying tonight, are
you coming to the showcase?

846
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:50,860
Well, I'll talk to you. Make.

847
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,230
A D uh.

848
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:58,316
My mom was on the way to pick me
up and you will never bleed this.

849
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:59,660
She got a boot on her car.

850
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:04,280
Uh, you mind if I just go to
your girl's showcase with you?

851
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:08,630
Sure. Cool.

852
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:51,330
All right. Cool.

853
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:58,370
We should just real fast.
We got plans tonight, camp.

854
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:02,450
I got a date tonight with the
MBA baller. Now, you know,

855
01:24:02,451 --> 01:24:03,731
he only wants you for your body.

856
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:07,370
And that's fine. Cause I only want
him for his money. So a Fairtrade.

857
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:11,690
Haven't your body. Got you in
enough trouble this week. Aye.

858
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:15,060
Hey, do you almost ready to go?

859
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:19,300
I just have to fill up
at the gas station first.

860
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:23,300
I called, cause I ain't got
no gas money. You got this.

861
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:32,790
I know

862
01:24:50,690 --> 01:24:55,520
since the day I was born, I never
needed a cook because he kept me safe.

863
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:17,700
Okay.

864
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:22,820
They know me every day.

865
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:28,550
They tell on me, just hold
on, babe. They won't be alone.

866
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:33,200
If I can trust them
and know that they love

867
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:57,690
wait, wait, excuse me.

868
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:06,470
Do you think God could really use you
think I could really use a sinner like me?

869
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:13,760
Everybody. Give me your
hands. Give me your hand.

870
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,889
Yeah. You know what? Uh,
let's look at it from.

871
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:22,210
Here, man. Take off for the
night. The show. Yeah, that's it.

872
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:35,840
Lord.

873
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:41,440
I come in favor of you to move
mountains for this young man.

874
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:47,410
Keep him safe. Protect them in your name.

875
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:49,790
Jesus. Amen.

876
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,870
We better get ready to go. We're going
to be late for the show. Hold on.

877
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:08,350
I want to play something

878
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:19,780
like that.

879
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,500
I'm glad you liked it.
Maybe that especially

880
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:40,490
that's the next thing on the album,

881
01:27:49,650 --> 01:27:50,820
James, what are you doing?

882
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:52,920
You got a few minutes.

883
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,180
This time you start showing me something.

884
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:01,860
A little taste of what
stuffed lamb we need to go.

885
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:07,080
I don't like to play games and you
want to both know what you want.

886
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:14,430
Everything is not always about you.
It is. It is about me. You know why?

887
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,280
Because I'm the one out here making deals

888
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:23,970
and it's time that you get down on your
knees and baby, just like the rest of.

889
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,710
Your right to shine.

890
01:28:31,711 --> 01:28:34,290
Couldn't possibly handle
a woman like me anyway.

891
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:40,050
I need a real man above plus

892
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:42,110
it's about time. I start treating myself.

893
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,900
Now. See, now you're starting to talk.

894
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:56,580
Don't you ever do that to me again,

895
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,100
father is going to get you.

896
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:25,080
Juice in the kitchen, my kitchen.

897
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,030
Oh,

898
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:46,190
he'll know what he's saying. Hey,

899
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,110
cheap, fast,

900
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:20,670
stupid.

901
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:28,290
Thank God.

902
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,010
There's something we need to talk about.

903
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:51,840
It

904
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:02,149
Was wrong. Everything was going to be.

905
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:06,560
Okay. Mama, head three kids.

906
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,450
It's not the baby Tiana.
I mean, it's my wife.

907
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:22,200
Everybody that comes into
my life. I heard them.

908
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:29,370
You're laid up here because
of me. This and I fell out.

909
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:35,340
Some goals popped up me today and
this old lady got killed. Okay.

910
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:46,380
Grandma died because of the stress of my

911
01:31:46,381 --> 01:31:50,850
own troubles. Sometimes tick,

912
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:55,050
I think this is where it
would be so much better.

913
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:57,120
If I was the one that was dead.

914
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,220
Ever talk like that.

915
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,420
What about me?

916
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:12,930
What about your children? What are we
supposed to do? If you're not here?

917
01:32:12,931 --> 01:32:13,931
No more.

918
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:22,470
Be a man by myself. I know
life has the stuffs and down,

919
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,810
but bad times. Don't last long.

920
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:29,160
We've come too far to give up now Ken,

921
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:34,920
and now we have to have another
baby between you and Deshaun.

922
01:32:35,010 --> 01:32:37,650
We'll work things out. You always do.

923
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:42,990
He's your only cousin. Did you all he got

924
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:53,220
well, I do you really think
just the customer you'll grow,

925
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:55,530
shows up that he's not
going to need you anymore.

926
01:32:59,210 --> 01:33:02,550
When we get out of here, I
want to split things for you.

927
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:06,630
Let's go down to city
hall and get married.

928
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:13,410
See that ain't gonna make
anything better. Maybe. Maybe not,

929
01:33:13,411 --> 01:33:17,100
but it's definitely a step
in the right direction.

930
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,890
If you going through something,
I want to be right by your side,

931
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:27,180
going through it with you,
but not as your baby mom

932
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:30,820
as your wife

933
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,320
on hurry up.

934
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:38,761
Look,

935
01:33:38,762 --> 01:33:40,800
I know what's going to be some ladies
there and I'm trying to do some parking

936
01:33:40,801 --> 01:33:42,330
lot. Walk up.

937
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:47,970
Definitely not this one. In
order to bag the hottest chick,

938
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,280
you just got to stand
next to the hottest car.

939
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:52,240
Stupid boy. Right?

940
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:55,200
Call it what you want. No, you know what?

941
01:33:55,860 --> 01:34:00,480
I remember that one time I was leaning
against this car. Why would the chick cop

942
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:04,949
come on, man? How long
would it take the pump?

943
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:07,230
$2. So actually 28 yards.

944
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:29,740
That's it. That's it.

945
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:37,020
That's it. That's it.

946
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:47,940
That's it. That's it.

947
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:59,810
That's the difference between
us. If you and me came up

948
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:07,160
excuse me. Get paid.

949
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:12,110
Hey, do you know where lake in Austin is?

950
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:14,600
We don't know who you are.

951
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:18,799
Um, I think so. What.

952
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,070
Are you doing here in Chicago? West side.

953
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:26,600
Trust me. I know all about the hoods.

954
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:31,160
I'm hosting a private fashion show
tonight. Welcome to Shai soon.

955
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:41,350
Excuse me. But if you're
not doing anything later,

956
01:35:41,890 --> 01:35:46,780
I'm free all night after my show
and maybe we can hit the club,

957
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:49,630
get some drink, whatever you want.

958
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:55,480
Yeah. Sorry. I have plans

959
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,180
worn out with your girlfriend. That's.

960
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:04,269
It? Wow. And you're.

961
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:07,870
Honest about it. I'm
definitely not used to that.

962
01:36:09,490 --> 01:36:11,620
She wants to be a very, very special lady.

963
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:15,040
She's my dream girl.

964
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:29,470
Yeah.

965
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:35,470
He's on his wife. Okay. You
know, but where's your girl at.

966
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:38,170
All. She's in the back. Getting
ready. Can I see it for a second?

967
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:42,220
Can you talk to that for, I think
I want to protect my investor.

968
01:36:44,050 --> 01:36:45,050
She's in the back.

969
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,180
Idiot.

970
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:56,350
I'll be right back. Try not to
get into any trouble. Right? Cool.

971
01:36:56,410 --> 01:36:57,970
I'm just gonna look for some freestyle.

972
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,670
What's up? Hey, what's up man?

973
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:11,410
Where's Jasmine. Oh, she's
in the back end, right? So.

974
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:14,950
This is it. Is it about to blow up Jay?

975
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:21,160
Oh man. I've been wanting to tell you.

976
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:26,110
You've been loyal to me for
a long time. It's not see.

977
01:37:26,230 --> 01:37:27,910
Where I live brother, as you know.

978
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:31,210
But I appreciate you. I
want you to know that.

979
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:39,230
I got you back

980
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,980
And of course you didn't
have any money. I don't buy.

981
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:04,941
Nothing. Food and drink there.

982
01:38:04,942 --> 01:38:09,020
So you can't be taking people's drinks
said they ain't left it. Find us,

983
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:13,910
keep us loses. We don't want
to mess around the Contra mono.

984
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:17,600
I already got my shot for that dog.
Don't even worry about it. Obama cap.

985
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:25,580
You know why he's not going to be able
to make it. He was feeling a little sick.

986
01:38:25,581 --> 01:38:27,350
So he went on back to the hotel.

987
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:32,420
But what he did ask her to do was to last
year and the event. So she does well,

988
01:38:32,630 --> 01:38:33,260
you got yourself a.

989
01:38:33,261 --> 01:38:35,540
Deal. Okay, well, let's
get this thing started.

990
01:38:37,490 --> 01:38:40,780
Oh, I need some chocolate
to help me calm a combat.

991
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:44,270
Hey aren't you dishonest cousin.

992
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:47,390
Yeah. And.

993
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,500
So what, so is he with you? Nope.

994
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:53,630
I need to talk to him and RJ

995
01:38:57,260 --> 01:39:00,439
play him like that. Excuse me. When you.

996
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:04,640
Think, I don't know what you tried to
get through D just to get to James. Yeah.

997
01:39:04,910 --> 01:39:08,000
I saw you get out of his car the
other night. All them bags and.

998
01:39:08,630 --> 01:39:09,630
All the phone numbers.

999
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:14,870
First of all, you need to come
correct with how he's talking to me.

1000
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:18,200
Secondly, it's not even like that.

1001
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:23,750
Minnis females, just like you. The only
one to mess with dudes for one thing,

1002
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:25,980
money,

1003
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:29,870
everybody know you ain't want to mess
with di like that in the first place.

1004
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:34,610
You don't know anything
about me. I love to Shawn.

1005
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:37,790
He's a great man and he's very good to me.

1006
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:40,420
And I'm a good and faithful woman to him.

1007
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:44,000
So if you think that I'm
out to hurt your cousin,

1008
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:48,170
that shame on you because I'm not going
to mess up what we have for nothing.

1009
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:52,760
Not even my career. Now,

1010
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:56,390
James that's the snaky
needs to be looking out for

1011
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:22,040
Pick up your food. Hey,

1012
01:40:22,041 --> 01:40:25,780
Hey dude, dude.

1013
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:31,240
Man, I want to apologize to you
for what I said the other day, man.

1014
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:35,600
Song, ride or snap, man.

1015
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,500
I was wrong.

1016
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,650
Deshawn. When grandma died,

1017
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:45,770
you was the one I was looking after me.

1018
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,850
And I guess when Jasmine
came into the pitcher,

1019
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:56,800
I started to miss man.
But look, it's your life.

1020
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:01,000
I'm happy for you. And I respect that.

1021
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,300
Most importantly, man, I let you.

1022
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:08,180
Jump in. Listening to

1023
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:31,090
James.

1024
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:32,410
Is about to perform.

1025
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:36,660
Hey man, it's called you,
but that's Vanessa beat.

1026
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:40,850
So it can not now stop.
Tell us, tell him right now.

1027
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:44,040
I will tell him how you been
sneaking this girl behind his back.

1028
01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:46,800
What are you on drugs?

1029
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:50,710
Come on the shine. You know, I
would never do you like that, man?

1030
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:51,970
We like family.

1031
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:55,590
Man. His family. And I'm proud of
you playing them like that. Yeah.

1032
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:01,470
You want me to, sorry. I'll put your
hands on me. I'm calling my lawyer.

1033
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:04,890
It's what are you doing? I told
you to turn was almost up. Hey,

1034
01:42:04,891 --> 01:42:05,891
y'all saw that right?

1035
01:42:07,590 --> 01:42:12,450
I ain't see nothing. Hold on, hold
on James. You don't have to do that.

1036
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,480
You leave.

1037
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:16,140
Man. I ain't going nowhere,
man. Don't want you to tell Dee,

1038
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:18,096
tell him that you threatened
to ruin his girl career.

1039
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:20,700
If he said that you pushed
up on in the studio earlier,

1040
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:24,000
what are you talking about?
Candidates. Come on to shine. You know,

1041
01:42:24,001 --> 01:42:26,201
he's been jealous of our
relationship since high school.

1042
01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:30,720
Sure. It's true.

1043
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:34,410
James is not your friends earlier.

1044
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:38,520
James tried to proposition me for
sex in exchange for a music deal.

1045
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:40,900
He's not your friend.

1046
01:42:43,230 --> 01:42:47,160
Come on. You going to really listen
to some groupie chick you just met.

1047
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:49,930
You're gonna let her feed
you with a bunch of lies.

1048
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,220
She's the one that tried
to push up on me, Sean.

1049
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:57,750
I know that you think that James is
your friend, but trust me, he is not.

1050
01:42:59,010 --> 01:43:03,450
He only hangs out with you because he's
insecure about his own shortcomings.

1051
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:07,710
So he keeps you around because
you make less money than him.

1052
01:43:07,711 --> 01:43:11,760
And it makes them feel good to be
literally you, but trust me, baby,

1053
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:15,210
you are so much better than him
and you don't need him at all.

1054
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:19,170
Hmm. See, that's where you're
wrong. He does need me.

1055
01:43:20,190 --> 01:43:22,430
When I'm around, the Shaun
gets a little bit good lights.

1056
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:26,490
He drives the fanciest cars we eat
at the most upscale restaurants.

1057
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:28,619
Hell he needs people that
he'd only read about in.

1058
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:32,610
Magazines. I give them a taste of
what it feels like to be a stop.

1059
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:37,000
And to Sean knows there's nothing wrong
with living in another man shadow.

1060
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:38,730
Especially if his mom.

1061
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:43,530
Deshaun doesn't need to live in
anybody's shadow. She casts his own.

1062
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:46,860
No. What? You're skating on thin ice girls

1063
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:54,410
can't believe you do this to me.
I thought we were brothers, man.

1064
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:03,499
Did you know
me, man? I know you not.

1065
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:06,470
Believe in this mess.
You know me, Joe, right?

1066
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:10,129
I do know you. I chose.

1067
01:44:10,130 --> 01:44:13,370
To look in the other direction
because I realized something.

1068
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:18,410
I realized that I did like living in
your shadow because I looked up to you.

1069
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:24,170
But now I know can only
look down at his snake.

1070
01:44:25,070 --> 01:44:26,720
Come off. You don't come off.

1071
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:29,510
That was a good line.
Hey, I'm gonna use that.

1072
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,510
Let's go, Kenneth, Jasmine.

1073
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:38,900
I know you have to perform. So I'll
come to your house tonight. No.

1074
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:42,730
If my man is leaving,
then I'm leaving too.

1075
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:45,270
I don't care anything
about this record deal.

1076
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:47,340
Especially if it means working under him.

1077
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:54,730
I think I like her. So we out.

1078
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:01,960
Hey, you're nothing without me.

1079
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:04,270
You and Mitch.

1080
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:08,080
And that convict cousin of yours
y'all can get the hell out of there.

1081
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:14,200
My hostel wants told me that
haters are going to hate.

1082
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:18,160
Elevate and motivate you,

1083
01:45:20,110 --> 01:45:23,110
but I'm going to do you a
solid and ladies, hands on you.

1084
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:34,989
The one I told you, what.

1085
01:45:34,990 --> 01:45:37,660
Would happen if I caught
you cheating on me again?

1086
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:44,620
I hope the sex was worth 2.7

1087
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:46,330
didn't meal, young.

1088
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:01,450
I'm sorry. I'm messing up your big chance.

1089
01:46:02,410 --> 01:46:06,550
You did it earlier. Maybe one
of the executives backstage.

1090
01:46:06,551 --> 01:46:08,980
And I told them what
was going on with James.

1091
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:14,650
He set up a personal meeting with me
and Clive Davis tomorrow. God is good.

1092
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:22,030
Look, I haven't been totally
honest about things in my life.

1093
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:27,420
I know you don't know.

1094
01:46:27,850 --> 01:46:30,670
I must stupidest shine
and you still want to be,

1095
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:34,330
of course it was never about what you had.

1096
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:36,940
I liked you since the first day I met you.

1097
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,210
Wait a minute. Pardon me?

1098
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:48,720
You still treat boom. Hey, you
better treat them right by the way.

1099
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:52,810
Trust me.

1100
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,440
All right. All right. All right.
I got to tell you something, man.

1101
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:05,600
May I please meet you in the car? Huh?

1102
01:47:07,670 --> 01:47:11,090
What's he on his doing
good, babe. He's doing good.

1103
01:47:19,730 --> 01:47:20,870
Man. Thanks man.

1104
01:47:21,650 --> 01:47:25,220
Next time, you know you be telling me you
have the football team running around.

1105
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:27,020
No, no, no, no, no.

1106
01:47:28,490 --> 01:47:33,350
But you know it, men I'm gonna do
things right? This time we going get me.

1107
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:36,080
Tenants. Danny married.

1108
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:42,190
Must have walked off..

1109
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:47,480
You know what, man, when I look
around that days, I check out life.

1110
01:47:47,481 --> 01:47:51,680
Dude. There's so much bad
stuff out here in trouble.

1111
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:53,899
It's about time. I get
myself together. You.

1112
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:58,040
Know? I'm glad to hear that.
Yeah. Grandma's in heaven.

1113
01:47:58,070 --> 01:48:03,020
Smiling right now. Well.

1114
01:48:05,090 --> 01:48:09,740
I tell you, what is she smiling
about this just way to tomorrow.

1115
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:14,270
What's happening tomorrow. Let's
just say it's a church day.

1116
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:22,070
Next thing you'll be
telling me. I gave baptized.

1117
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:01,590
I baptize you in the name of the
father, the son and the holy ghost.

1118
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:21,570
Check it out. It's
on the track because the 808,

1119
01:50:21,571 --> 01:50:25,590
they got my back helping me carry
on my baggage. Like I have pack.

1120
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:28,470
I know I'm difficult and I'm
only a nurse. That's real love.

1121
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:31,770
Cause don't too many staples and pennies.
All genetics. That's real blood look,

1122
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:36,210
mommy, mommy. And mommy's
break. When they still around,

1123
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:39,240
my family blew me up.

1124
01:51:03,270 --> 01:51:03,841
Irritate him,

1125
01:51:03,842 --> 01:51:07,650
but I never lose enough unless somebody
paid it because they might interest

1126
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:13,740
that they wanted
more. I want fly by on me. Bam.

1127
01:51:13,741 --> 01:51:17,160
I see me stay on my. Like they was

1128
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:24,580
the normal guy. I still,

1129
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:33,300
I got him like the latest show.
Remember who? Ain't gotta chill

1130
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:39,330
grandma project.

1131
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:47,520
Instead I live with the pain of so many
things that I was just saying promises
