1
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,703
              Man:
      What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

2
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,272
     If this was unethical,
      it would be illegal.

3
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,207
      What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

4
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,176
     If this was unethical,
      it would be illegal.

5
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:46,412
      What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

6
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,514
     If this was unethical,
      it would be illegal.

7
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,549
      What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

8
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,217
     If this was unethical,
      it would be illegal.

9
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,387
      What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

10
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,556
     If this was unethical,
      it would be illegal.

11
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,092
      What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

12
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:02,361
     If this was unethical,
      it would be illegal.

13
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:04,530
      What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

14
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,665
     If this was unethical,
      it would be illegal.

15
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,701
      What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

16
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,137
     If this was unethical,
      it would be illegal.

17
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,473
      What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

18
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,608
     If this was unethical,
      it would be illegal.

19
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,345
      What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

20
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,781
     If this was unethical,
      it would be illegal.

21
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,583
      That company mantra
       was the only thing

22
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,586
          fending off
        this latest bout
        of moral crisis.

23
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,588
 You see, I just sold this guy

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,323
  and his two financial gurus

25
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,093
   on investing $200 million
     in our mortgage fund.

26
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,229
He will lose almost everything.

27
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:40,466
 My firm will make $26 million.

28
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:42,701
    And it's totally legal.

29
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,703
Therefore, it is not unethical.

30
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,678
        At a young age,
       it occurred to me
     that I was different.

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,849
You see, it's always been easier
for me to relate intellectually
   as opposed to emotionally.

32
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,650
      While most children
     were playing pretend,

33
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,752
      I focused my efforts
      on counting to 100.

34
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,224
   For Halloween, I departed
 from the traditional superhero
           or ghoul,

35
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,596
      and instead dressed
as seven-time mathlete champion,
        Franklin Stubbs.

36
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,566
        In high school,
   I divided my time between
   "The Wall Street Journal"

37
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,435
    and classic literature.

38
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:19,838
    By 16, I had a life plan
mapped out to my 65th birthday.

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,141
         After a freak
     Segway-ing accident...

40
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:24,510
           landed me
   in the college infirmary,

41
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,878
     I had my heart stolen
     by a sympathetic coed
 working on her nursing degree.

42
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,349
       Somehow, she found
  my idiosyncrasies endearing.

43
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,418
          Eight years
and two business degrees later,

44
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,720
      I landed in finance.

45
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:38,323
      We hate Wall Street!
      We hate Wall Street!

46
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,526
              Man:
     To survive the crash,
       I worked overtime.

47
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,361
  Some nights, I slept there.

48
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,762
     I had goals to reach.

49
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,198
         I got the car,
       bought the house,

50
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,233
     then worked my way up
       to vice president.

51
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,469
        After this deal,
   they'd make me a partner.

52
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,840
      Overnight, our firm
 was gonna be worth three-fold.

53
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,809
  To celebrate, the top brass
   threw a party in my honor.

54
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,479
    It didn't occur to them
      that I neither drink
        nor enjoy bars,

55
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:03,315
 but being the man of the hour,
      I was forced to make
         an appearance

56
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,651
           and enjoy
   my 18-dollar virgin tonic.

57
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:08,554
       Jim! Jim, my man!

58
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,622
         How you doing?
  You having a good time, huh?

59
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:14,293
        I just wanna say
   excellent work. Top notch.

60
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:17,596
     -What we asked of you
         was not easy.
          -Thank you.

61
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,199
       You enjoy yourself
    because you deserve it.

62
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,884
           I... I am.

63
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,568
         Unfortunately,
        it is about time
      for me to head out.

64
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,571
              -No!
     -Becky leaves for work
         in 45 minutes,

65
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,873
   and she'll be disappointed
    if I don't see her off.

66
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,758
     Listen, good for you.

67
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,642
         Before you go,
      let's get a picture
       with Phil and Hal.

68
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,545
  Don't you move. Don't move.

69
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,548
              Jim:
          Today's mark
 was an eccentric billionaire.

70
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,217
        But I had spent
       the last six years

71
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,851
         talking people
      out of their money,

72
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,888
   banks, college endowments,
    teachers' pension funds.

73
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,558
If there was a nickel to be had,
    it was my job to get it.

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,759
    When the guilt piled up,

75
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,761
 I buried it with my ambition.

76
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,897
   If I climbed high enough,
    maybe I could outrun it.

77
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,000
       -Jim, how are you?
             -Good.

78
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,369
             -Jim.
          -Come on in.

79
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,370
          Take a seat.

80
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,838
         How is Becky?

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,406
   Uh, she's... She's great.

82
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,875
We're trying to start a family.

83
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,778
          Good. Good.
   That's really great, Jim.

84
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,280
  We're gonna let you go, Jim.

85
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,482
         -Come on, Hal.
   -Show a little tact, Hal.

86
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,750
         Cut the crap,
  and tell him why he's here.

87
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,485
    But we just went public
    with the mortgage fund.

88
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,521
     Hey, your work on that
      was top notch, Jim.

89
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,073
   The bonds are under water.

90
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:19,624
   It's just a matter of time
    before they all blow up.

91
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,593
     There was no other way
to achieve those target numbers.

92
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:22,995
       You were perfectly
         aware of this.

93
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:24,630
  We gave you a number to hit.

94
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,264
  You're the one that decided
         how to hit it.

95
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,267
       This is all gonna
     come back on us, Jim,

96
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,502
        and believe me,
      it's gonna be better
        for all of us...

97
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,471
      if you're not here.

98
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:35,774
          I was loyal,

99
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,710
        and you used me.

100
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,645
     Now, there's no reason
    this can't be amicable.

101
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,913
  And no one twisted your arm.

102
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,291
              Jim:
     With Alpha pinning me
        as the fall guy,

103
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:54,660
 my career in finance was over.

104
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,795
 No other firm would touch me.

105
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,363
    Hey, you're home early.

106
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,301
           So, I had
 the most disgusting day today.

107
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:07,306
     Cresting Elementary's
  corn chips and chili fry day
     went completely awry.

108
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:11,843
      A hundred and twenty
     fifth graders show up
    spewing from both ends.

109
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,846
         We had to make
 an emergency run to Home Depot
       for extra buckets.

110
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,751
        I bet you forgot
         we have dinner
   with your parents tonight.

111
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,553
          Do you know
 if your grandfather is coming?

112
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,988
      Because I love him,
         but I just...

113
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,390
       I need to mentally
    prepare myself for him.

114
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,942
              Jim:
    All that ladder climbing

115
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:28,493
       just made my fall
   that much more traumatic.

116
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,562
         What's wrong?

117
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,630
              Jim:
  I was disgusted with myself
 and repulsed by the business.

118
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,633
          I got fired.

119
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,435
              Jim:
   I hadn't outrun anything.

120
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:39,604
         So, you're...
  You're happy you got fired?

121
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,106
       No. I don't know.

122
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,675
     I think I'd just like
     to try something else.

123
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,978
      Well, I didn't know
you had anything other passions
        besides finance.

124
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,047
 Sure, I do. Plenty of things.

125
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,450
       I just need to...
    find out what they are.

126
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,088
      It'll be fine, hon.

127
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,422
            I know.

128
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,490
     You'll figure it out.

129
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:03,495
       At least one thing
   is gonna get a lot easier
 with you home during the day.

130
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,764
    I... I can't even think
 about having babies right now.

131
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,399
       We've already had
       that conversation.

132
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,034
         Yes, and now,
      I don't have a job.

133
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,068
     Well, you'll find one.

134
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,403
     It could take a while.

135
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,105
    We've waited four years
          to be ready.

136
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,107
         I want a baby.

137
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:17,909
   I want us to have a baby.

138
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,544
            I know.

139
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,546
       But I'm really not
    in the right head space
           right now.

140
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,051
    Not even just a little?

141
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:28,854
       Well, that's nice.

142
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,759
       And if I do this?

143
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,861
            (sighs)
 Okay, maybe when you do that.

144
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,531
         What is that?

145
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:40,632
             What?

146
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,833
         On your shirt.

147
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:44,703
          Face scrub.

148
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,505
         No, that's...

149
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,039
    That's definitely vomit.

150
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,409
        All right, well,
this shirt is coming off anyway.

151
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:52,177
              Oh!

152
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,114
              Jim:
       The career turmoil
   had caused me to reflect.

153
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,617
  Not just on my own choices,

154
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,119
  but on my family's long line
 of working-class forefathers.

155
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:04,022
 Men like my great-grandfather,
    William Edward Preston.

156
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:08,026
      He worked his way up
    from small-town butcher
 to East Coast farming legend.

157
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,694
    Not only did he harvest
         his own crops,

158
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,063
         but he managed
       their distribution
      across New York City

159
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,966
    and still found the time
     to run a soup kitchen
         every Sunday.

160
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:19,070
   My father and grandfather
       built their legacy
   through honest, hard work.

161
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,956
       For over 50 years,

162
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:22,841
    they delivered chocolate
        to supermarkets
      across the country.

163
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:26,478
From a young age, I was groomed
     and expected to tread
        the family path.

164
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,782
 My decision to pursue finance
     had been met with a...
      lukewarm reception.

165
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,051
  I told you not to go to work
       for those crooks.

166
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,953
  They're financial managers,
              Dad.

167
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,155
        Grandpop Adams:
       Anybody that makes
        all their money

168
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,157
    off other people's money
          is a crook.

169
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,092
       It doesn't matter
      what you call them.

170
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,527
          -Yeah, yeah.
         -Case closed.

171
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,728
              Dad:
        Case is closed.

172
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,497
        -Case is closed.
        -Case is closed.

173
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,966
     Yeah. Yeah, I'll have
 another martini here, please.

174
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,668
    -Oh, that sounds great.
             -Yeah.

175
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,838
       Now... here's what
      we're gonna do, Jim.

176
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,873
  We're gonna put you to work
       in the warehouse.

177
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,008
    Help you to start making
       some honest money.

178
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,111
 You know Jim doesn't have any
interest in the warehouse, Dad.

179
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,246
   Let me see your hand, Jim.

180
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:04,249
    Right. Look at his hand.
    Look at your son's hand.

181
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,717
      -I don't wanna look
         at this hand.
           -Go ahead.

182
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:06,735
          I know what
      his hand looks like.

183
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,752
              Mom:
  He doesn't wanna look at it.

184
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,221
      It's like a woman's.

185
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,555
      Is that a manicure?

186
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:11,756
            -James.
      -That's enough, Dad.

187
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,725
      -I was only asking.
       -No, it's enough.

188
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,693
         -I don't know
   what's normal these days.
        -That's enough.

189
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:18,163
          No, I, uh...
    I don't have a manicure.

190
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,865
       I like his hands.

191
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,234
        And what's wrong
       with our business?

192
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,570
    It's raised this family
      for two generations.

193
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,506
         -That's true.
    -And I appreciate that.

194
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,874
       I just... I wanna
        find my own way.

195
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:29,841
             Yeah.

196
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,243
          Sorry, Dad.

197
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:32,511
      No need to be sorry.

198
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,846
  How are you fixed for cash?

199
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,214
  We're not taking your money.

200
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,983
They gave me a small severance.

201
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,951
 Yes, and we have some savings.

202
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,853
      So, he has some time
       to figure it out.

203
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,922
        -I say we toast.
       -Yes. Absolutely.

204
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:44,890
      To new a beginning.

205
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,791
        Excuse me, miss.

206
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,260
 Are you distilling my spirits,

207
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:51,263
   or am I to expect my drink
     sometime this evening?

208
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,567
              Jim:
       For the first time
       in my adult life,

209
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,235
    I was without direction.

210
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,004
        But it was time
       to take inventory,

211
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,939
     discover new interests
        and pursue them.

212
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,610
        ¶ What if I had
 just a little bit more time? ¶

213
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,216
        ¶ To chase down
       moments like this
      and make them mine ¶

214
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:17,756
      ¶ What if this night
   had never come to pass? ¶

215
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:23,295
  ¶ How many nights like this
       have I got left? ¶

216
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:29,601
    ¶ I leave in the morning
for the country where I'm from ¶

217
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,937
              Jim:
   My grandfather was right.

218
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,772
         I hadn't done
     any truly honest work

219
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:36,808
         since sweeping
   the warehouse floor at 15.

220
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,009
      Alpha had plucked me
        out of college.

221
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,578
          I never had
       to look for a job,

222
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,646
     never had to fill out
        an application.

223
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:42,847
  Something millions of people
         do every day,

224
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,082
   and I didn't have a clue.

225
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,891
 So, what mortgage derivatives
   does your former employer
           invest in?

226
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,298
         Man (over PA):
        Now calling A57.

227
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,667
        Now calling A57.

228
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,275
      Hi. I'm here to see
 about finding new employment.

229
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,016
 Right across the street there
    is a community college.

230
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:22,087
    They offer what we call
    job preparatory classes.

231
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,989
        You get yourself
       into one of those,

232
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,790
and I'll get you your benefits.

233
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,659
    "Making Art from Trash"?

234
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,727
       Trade skill, hon.

235
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,630
           What about
     "Interpretive Dance"?

236
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,731
        Personal growth.

237
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,700
       I just want a job.

238
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,204
     -And we will be happy
     to help you find one.
            -Great.

239
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,873
          Just as soon
   as I get you the benefits.

240
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,052
              Jim:
    After a six-year hiatus,

241
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,920
        I found the idea
of returning to school charming.

242
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,223
   No doubt it would provide
    the spark of inspiration
           I needed.

243
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,226
       (wheels squeaking)

244
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,330
 Vending machines and bathrooms
       are down the hall.

245
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,132
           Good luck
    with your career paths.

246
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,800
   In this three-part series,

247
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:12,270
        we'll teach you
       how to find a job
      using the Internet.

248
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,407
        Raise your hand
      if you've ever used
       a computer before.

249
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,678
         Good for you.

250
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,414
 Now, let's go over the basics
 of filling out an application
            online.

251
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:26,117
 First, you will want to create
    a username and password.

252
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,820
              Jim:
  After suffering through the
 No Child Left Behind program,

253
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,722
it was time to hit the streets.

254
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,390
I needed something blue collar,

255
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,226
 something my great-grandfather
   Preston would be proud of.

256
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,729
         Society needed
      people contributing
      on the ground floor,

257
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,131
         not middle men
   living off interest rates
        and derivatives.

258
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,767
     My name is Jim Adams.
I'm looking for new employment.

259
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,036
     Do you have any, uh...
 Do you have any job openings?

260
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,337
       (speaking Spanish)

261
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,909
         Oh, Audi? Yes.

262
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,078
       Yes, I actually...
        I have an Audi.

263
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,747
I'd love to learn more about it
 and work... Here's my resume.

264
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,215
I'm a bit overqualified, I know,

265
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,317
     but I'm really willing
     to learn a new trade.

266
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,019
   This is... This is great.

267
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,854
       (speaking Spanish)

268
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,923
      -Yeah. "Try it out."
      -(speaking Spanish)

269
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,058
  I would love to try it out.

270
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,226
         That's exactly
    what I'm looking to do.

271
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,095
  That's... Wow, okay. Well...

272
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,131
    -So I'll just call you?
      -(speaking Spanish)

273
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,265
         -I'll call...
      -(speaking Spanish)

274
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,767
             -Okay?
          -Okay. Wow.

275
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,103
          -All right.
      -(speaking Spanish)

276
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,338
        That feels good
       just to have that
          on my hands.

277
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,274
    -Doesn't even bother me.
        Doesn't even...
             -Okay.

278
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,976
         -I'm excited.
      -(speaking Spanish)

279
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,177
             Okay.

280
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,377
       So, what are you,
         a stockbroker?

281
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,513
  I worked in the bond market.

282
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,265
   That's not a stockbroker?

283
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:32,016
          No. No, sir.
    I've never been licensed
      to sell securities.

284
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,218
        You ever do work
       like this before?

285
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,253
          I have not,
   but I am a quick learner.

286
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,805
       I'm sure you are.

287
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,356
   But we don't have the time
 or the personnel to train you.

288
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:40,759
           Thank you.

289
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,395
 I could start by sweeping up.

290
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,897
   My kid does that already.

291
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,869
       Here is my resume.

292
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,872
    Well, if it doesn't say
     you've ever cut, sold,
       or laid carpet...

293
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,108
       you might as well
   put it back in your purse.

294
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,013
    This is an attache case.

295
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,014
           Thank you.

296
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,885
              Jim:
    It had been three weeks.

297
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,187
   And after hand delivering
        57 applications,

298
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:13,391
    I had managed to secure
nothing more than an appointment
       for an oil change.

299
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,060
       Maybe I was doomed
      to be a white-collar
          desk jockey.

300
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,914
          Waffle fact.

301
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,117
With more than 1,700 locations,
       all open 24 hours,

302
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:43,254
   Papa's Chicken and Waffle
     is the seventh largest
food chain in the United States.

303
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,124
   During my college heyday,
 Papa's was a late-night staple

304
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,827
          and a place
 I could always clear my head.

305
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,529
 Just seeing the establishment
     provided more comfort
   than I had felt in months.

306
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,201
     (oldies music playing)

307
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,135
             Yeah.

308
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,575
             Yeah.

309
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,309
       -Just have a seat.
   She'll be right with you.
             -Okay.

310
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:08,012
      You are right, man.
      That has definitely
         got something.

311
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,848
   It's called groove, baby,

312
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,616
         and not a lot
   of those new cats have it.

313
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,551
          -(laughing)
      -I'm with you, bro.

314
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:17,121
     How much is the Wanda?

315
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:22,060
Same price as it was yesterday,
    Kathy, $9.72 with taxes.

316
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,461
           Hey, Mary!

317
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:24,896
      Where you at, girl?

318
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,098
    I mean, people are dying
    of starvation out here.

319
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,351
            Coming!

320
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:31,603
          Come on now!
      I can't be grilling
 and greeting at the same time.

321
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,640
     I will have the Wanda.

322
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:36,574
           Coming up.

323
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,476
            -Wanda!
       -Wanda's working.

324
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,111
      What can I get you?

325
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,947
         Orange juice,
       Wyatt with cheese,
      and an application.

326
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,318
       What do you mean?
      You wanna work here?

327
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,920
     Are you still hiring?

328
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,388
      We're always hiring.

329
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,356
It's my third time working here.

330
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,991
         Lord help us.

331
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,926
         Fill this out.
      I'll get a manager.

332
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,494
 -There's only four questions.
             -Yeah.

333
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,498
   I guess I just expected it
         to be longer.

334
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,900
         Not at Papa's.

335
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,568
           Hey, hey,
    what's the man's order?

336
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,204
  And call it out on the bird.

337
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,607
       Wyatt with cheese.

338
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,076
 Copy that. Wyatt with cheese.

339
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,278
       Coming on the fly.

340
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,947
     You like working here?

341
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,649
           (chuckles)
      It's not "Top Chef,"

342
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,550
        but it keeps me
      on the grill, baby.

343
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,985
             Woman:
 You looking for a job, honey?

344
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,153
      You're the manager.

345
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,322
      -Assistant. Jacqui.
        -I'm Jim Adams.

346
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:28,092
      Well, Mr. Jim Adams,
        you certainly do
       dress to impress.

347
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,928
         You ever work
    in a restaurant before?

348
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,363
          -I haven't.
      -I didn't think so.

349
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,631
    What was your last job?

350
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,366
    Well, I've always worked
          in finance,

351
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,601
but I'm seeking a career change.

352
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,987
    Preferably honest work.

353
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:41,372
   Something that gives back,
 something that, when I go home
     at the end of the day,

354
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,241
        I can still have
      a sense of dignity.

355
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,443
 Well, all I need is a server.

356
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,511
     Two of them just quit.

357
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,146
Well, one of the got hauled off,

358
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,982
      but nobody got time
         for all that.

359
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,150
  You think you can handle it?

360
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,718
  I'd welcome the opportunity.

361
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,219
         Is that a yes?

362
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,654
       A resounding yes.

363
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,693
         Mary, grab Jim
 one of those new-hire packets.

364
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,127
             Mary:
            Got it.

365
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,595
         Can you start
      tomorrow 8:00 a.m.?

366
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,630
             I can.

367
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,182
          Good answer.

368
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:08,733
       Now, manager Matt
        will be on duty.

369
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,086
        So you make sure
     you make me look good,

370
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:13,438
        and you go home
  and you familiarize yourself
with the Rise and Shine manual.

371
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,372
           Of course.

372
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,074
      Oh, and, Jim, baby,

373
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,576
          wear jeans.

374
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,077
   People who dress like that
     end up getting mugged
          around here.

375
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,024
  It doesn't really hurt much.

376
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,192
           Oh, okay.

377
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,126
  I was wondering about that.

378
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,194
             Yeah.

379
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,364
             -Hey.
             -Hey.

380
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,101
         Best of luck.

381
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,219
      I'm sure they, uh...

382
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,336
    they deal with this sort
     of thing all the time.

383
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,138
         Yeah, thanks.

384
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,306
             Okay.

385
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,345
     Everything all right?

386
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,446
       Yeah, yeah, fine.

387
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,348
        I thought the ER
        creeps you out.

388
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,349
          Still does.

389
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,752
        I had some news
  I wanted to share with you.

390
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,520
         An opportunity
     has presented itself,

391
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,088
         and I just...
     I couldn't pass it up.

392
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,525
Okay, now, I'm getting excited.
          What is it?

393
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,160
   Papa's Chicken and Waffle.

394
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,529
         What about it?

395
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,530
    It's where I'm working.

396
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,134
        You're managing
  a Papa's Chicken and Waffle?

397
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,402
       No, I'm a server.

398
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:18,536
   I start training tomorrow.

399
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,306
        Are you joking?

400
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,208
        No, I'm actually
   kind of excited about it.

401
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,180
              Why?

402
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,548
  Because it's a fresh start.

403
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,284
 It's a chance to clear my head
    and work with my hands.

404
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,519
         I really wish
         you would have
        figured that out

405
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,754
      before we forked out
       50 grand on an MBA

406
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:40,425
     and spent seven years
        traveling around
 for your career in that world.

407
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:41,559
            So do I.

408
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,267
     Papa's Waffle? Really?

409
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,102
   Chicken and Waffle, yeah.

410
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,105
     What are you reading?

411
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,139
         I'm studying.

412
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,341
           For what?

413
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,443
          My new job.

414
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,279
   That's for waiting tables?

415
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,714
        What's in there?

416
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,482
       Sure, take a look.

417
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,254
    "During off-peak hours,

418
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,823
         "servers must
      restock condiments,

419
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,157
         "mop floors...

420
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,526
   "sanitize the bathrooms."

421
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,161
 It's refreshingly regimented.

422
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,430
         You do realize
  those are public bathrooms,
             right?

423
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,566
             Sure.

424
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:24,702
         Have you seen
      what the public does
         to a bathroom?

425
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,706
             Yeah.

426
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,308
     This ought to be good.

427
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,742
          Here you go.

428
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:32,810
           Have fun.

429
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:35,646
           Thank you.

430
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,555
            Morning.

431
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,290
   How long have you been up?

432
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,759
        Since yesterday
        about this time.

433
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,578
           All night?

434
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:52,396
        Well, it's just
 the manager is counting on me
       to have this down.

435
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,635
   You're ironing your jeans?

436
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,339
    People iron their jeans.

437
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,707
        No, they don't.

438
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:03,774
        You're nervous.

439
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,310
  I wouldn't say I'm nervous.

440
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,245
          Actually...

441
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,280
       it's kind of cute.

442
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,550
      This is interesting.

443
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:17,755
     "In order to qualify,
  a franchisee must first work
    a minimum of 1,000 hours

444
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,490
      "at a Papa's Chicken
          and Waffle."

445
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,660
            That is
  an inspired business model.

446
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,897
        Let's just start
       by getting through
        your first day.

447
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,670
     (oldies music playing)

448
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:52,390
        ¶ Oh, my darling
          I have... ¶

449
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,958
       What you gonna do?

450
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,892
           Excuse me?

451
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,395
           What job?

452
00:19:58,464 --> 00:19:59,630
        I'll be serving.

453
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,333
        What about you?

454
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,635
            Kitchen.

455
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:11,876
              Jim:
          Waffle fact.

456
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,244
       It's not something
        they advertise,

457
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,396
 but Papa's Chicken and Waffle

458
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:17,547
          is America's
     third largest employer
   of ex-convicts and felons,

459
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,551
        a true testament
       to Papa's founder,
     Jason Hank Kramerson's

460
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,421
       unwavering belief
  in the redemptive qualities
      of the human spirit.

461
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,324
          Manuel, hey,
    great to have you back.

462
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,525
  What's it been, six months?

463
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,427
     Twelve. Got out early.

464
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,861
         Good behavior?

465
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,263
         Overcrowding.

466
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,531
        Well, well done.

467
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,949
       Luckily, not much
    has changed around here,

468
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,366
       so we can get you
   right back in the kitchen.

469
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,636
             -Cool.
          -Very cool.

470
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,671
    Jim, welcome to Papa's.

471
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,573
    I'm excited to be here.

472
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,442
          I like that.
         You should be.

473
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:45,476
         Come with me.

474
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:49,647
    I'm not the kind of guy
    who likes to sit around
       flapping his jaws.

475
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,316
I like to throw you in the fire,
         sink or swim.

476
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,418
       The only real way
       to learn is to do.

477
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,204
        You get a chance
  to look at that packet yet?

478
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:57,989
   Fastidiously. I even found
   a few grammatical errors.

479
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,207
        I'll take that.

480
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,424
          You can make
   a lot of money here, Jim.

481
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,493
 And I'm not just saying that.

482
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:05,696
       It was hard for me
 when my construction business
          went under.

483
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,032
  I didn't know what to expect
  when I first came on board.

484
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:10,801
  But I'll tell you something.
         You work hard,
       and you produce...

485
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,036
     there is opportunity.

486
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,372
  I started out just like you.

487
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:15,773
And now, I'm the store manager.
           Thank you.

488
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,441
    That's very encouraging.

489
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,976
   You're damn right, it is.

490
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,511
    I like your energy, Jim.

491
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,513
    I'm gonna start you off
    on the ordering process.

492
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,015
          After that,
  on the register with Jacqui.

493
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,650
       Then you're gonna
    follow Mary for the day.

494
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,752
     -Edward, this is Jim,
        our new server.
             -Hey.

495
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,887
          Show him how
  we get it done around here.

496
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,455
           Hey. Hey.

497
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,057
     I'm gonna throw a lot
         at you, Jimmy.

498
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,326
     So you better be ready
          to catch it.

499
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,994
           It's Jim.
 Only my parents call me Jimmy.

500
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,798
       Well, consider me
       your waffle daddy.

501
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:43,301
Now, here comes the first pitch.

502
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,537
  When you call in the order,

503
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,038
       make sure you have
     two feet on the tile.

504
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,439
    That's two feet square.

505
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,841
  And be certain we hear you.

506
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,443
        So, call it like
       you have meaning.

507
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:55,479
  I need a Winnie, two Wendys,
       and a Brenda Joe.

508
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,315
   Eight options on the menu.

509
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,483
      Papa had eight kids.

510
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,052
   That ain't a coincidence.

511
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:04,021
         Now, the boys
  liked their waffles savory.

512
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,690
   And call it at the grill,

513
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:09,427
    and we add the chicken,
      bacon, and the eggs.

514
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,762
  The girls liked them sweet.

515
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,398
    Service dress them here.

516
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,833
    Somebody want the Mama,

517
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,502
           that's one
    of our specialty orders.

518
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,704
      They get the works.

519
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,005
 Ice cream in the deep freeze.

520
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,107
       Who's Brenda Joe?

521
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,809
    Oh, that's Papa's baby.

522
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:27,712
             Yeah,
   the only one who got away
    with ordering pancakes.

523
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,580
    Doesn't start with a W.

524
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,984
     Um, maybe they ran out
        of names with W.

525
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,487
        Whitney is one.

526
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:39,457
       Willy, or Wilfred,
         or Wilhelmina.

527
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,625
     Hey, we ain't got time
      for your semantics.

528
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:43,894
          Hey, Jacqui.

529
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,598
      Show Jimmy boy here
         the register.

530
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,071
            Jacqui:
   Okay, and then you add...
     Yeah, just like that.

531
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,140
         Oh. Oh, okay,
  I usually do it another way,

532
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,441
 but that seems to work better.

533
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,443
            $36.38.

534
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:00,728
           Thank you.

535
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:02,012
        Now, you can use
         the built-in--

536
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:03,013
    (cash register opening)

537
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,584
     That's $37, $38, $39,

538
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:09,487
     and 62 cents makes $40
        is your change.

539
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,468
          Calculator.

540
00:23:12,469 --> 00:23:13,947
       Papa's thanks you
      for your patronage.

541
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:15,426
     Hope you can come back
     and see us again soon.

542
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,161
           Thank you.

543
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,895
   I have never seen anybody
take to the register like that.

544
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:19,897
           Thank you.

545
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,532
     Look, Jim, no offense,

546
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:24,101
       but you don't seem
  like the Papa's Waffle type.

547
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,604
       You look more like
     a school teacher or...

548
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,406
        carpet salesman.

549
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:31,675
    Jacqui, don't you think
       it's a little soon
    to malign my character?

550
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,477
       What kind of shoes
       are those anyway?

551
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,980
Cordovan leather straight tips.

552
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,748
        They don't look
      restaurant-friendly.

553
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,450
        Scuff-resistant,
        water-repellent,

554
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:42,052
 guaranteed to be as versatile
     as they are timeless.

555
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:44,722
     Price I paid for them,
   they better be as friendly
       as a shoe can get.

556
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:46,757
         All right now.

557
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,134
   I'm supposed to shadow you
          for the day.

558
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,136
             Okay.

559
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:04,442
   Jim: In his seminal work,
      "How to Win Friends
     and Influence People,"

560
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:07,511
      Dale Carnegie posits
      that the fastest way
   to make others warm to you

561
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,613
      is to encourage them
   to talk about themselves.

562
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,614
      Aren't you pregnant?

563
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:12,483
             Yeah.

564
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,985
     I'm just finishing off
        my last carton.

565
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,058
  Read any good books lately?

566
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,978
        I hate to read.

567
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:25,963
  The only book I've ever read
  is "The Caramel Seduction."

568
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:26,964
       What's that about?

569
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:27,965
         It's erotica.

570
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:32,603
          (chuckling)
 Oh, I... thought it might have
   been about Milton Hershey

571
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,605
         or some other
      confectionery mogul.

572
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,507
  There's no one named Milton
         in this book.

573
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:37,875
         Of course not.

574
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,242
        Milton is a name
  best suited for economists,

575
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,646
         not Casanovas.

576
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,048
  Mary! Hey, we're going down.
       I need you and Jim
    back on the floor ASAP.

577
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,399
        What about Cody?

578
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,749
       He had a summons.
    Come on, girl. Let's go.

579
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:56,227
  Thank you for your business
      and come again soon.

580
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:57,695
      Why is it like this?

581
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:59,930
        Afternoon rush.
       Happens every day.

582
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,533
 I need you to bus table seven
   and drop silver and menus
            at four.

583
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:03,267
        I'm sorry. What?

584
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,972
         Take this rag.
       Clean that table.

585
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,173
        Put these on it.

586
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,511
  Out of eggs. Out of cheese.
      Almost out of bacon.

587
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,913
        Hey, hey, Jimmy,
 we're sinking fast back here.

588
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,915
 We need a reload double time.

589
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,252
      Get to the walk-in.
     I need cheese, bacon,
       eggs, and butter.

590
00:25:21,254 --> 00:25:23,454
             Okay.

591
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,655
         Hey, hey, hey,
  we need syrup, strawberries,
     walnuts, and jam too.

592
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:26,690
             -Okay?
             -Okay.

593
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,192
 Wait. Who covers the register?

594
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,593
        Hey, man, look,
   forget about the register.

595
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,242
          What's that?

596
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,176
          It's cheese.

597
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:50,714
     I said, "Eggs, bacon,
      butter, and cheese."

598
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,716
  It's the first thing I saw.

599
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,819
      Hey, seriously, man,
    ain't you a college boy?

600
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,688
        I mean, how did
   you survive your last gig?

601
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,590
     I worked with numbers
         in the ether,

602
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,959
not toppings in a freezer, okay.
    I dealt in abstractions.

603
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:05,763
      Well, how about you
  abstract more than one item?

604
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:07,965
      You're not handling
         nitroglycerin.

605
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,800
       What's the holdup?
   Where's the strawberries?

606
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,769
  Apparently, Jimmy the genius

607
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,605
      can't figure his way
    past one bag of cheese.

608
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:15,773
            Just...

609
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:19,076
          Let's see...

610
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:25,215
   Hey, hey, Jimmy, come on!
  I need you to work with me,
             baby!

611
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,283
          -Jim: Sorry!
         -Work with me!

612
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,255
             Jimmy!

613
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,356
             Uh...

614
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,028
              -Oh!
         -(clattering)

615
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,797
     Jimmy, please tell me
   what wasn't my last bucket
         of bacon bits.

616
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:53,811
          Jacqui said
    she mentioned the shoes.

617
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,014
         She did. Yeah.

618
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,149
        It's all right.
        I've seen worse.

619
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,188
             Okay.

620
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,789
    You're right. I haven't.

621
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,192
   But the important thing is
        you got back up,

622
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:10,160
   and you finished the job.

623
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,930
         Now, as stated
     in the Rise and Shine,

624
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:15,165
  all employees must complete
   a week-long trial period.

625
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:19,303
           But after
    what I've seen today...

626
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,306
the ability to abandon all pride
     in the line of duty...

627
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:26,677
  well, I know Papa's material
         when I see it.

628
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,815
          You're part
    of the family now, Jim.

629
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:37,254
          I'm honored.

630
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,722
        I know you are.

631
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,394
 Hey, I hate to do this to you,

632
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,962
   but I need you to come in
      a couple hours early
         on Wednesday.

633
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,197
             Okay.

634
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,431
   We just got word the owner
is gonna pay us a little visit,

635
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,434
           and I need
     this place to sparkle.

636
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,203
             Right.

637
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:03,047
      That hurts so good.

638
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,049
      I think my left leg
        just went numb.

639
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:06,817
     -You want me to stop?
        -Don't you dare.

640
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:09,119
    This is the only chance
  I have of walking tomorrow.

641
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,755
        All right, well,
    besides getting maimed,

642
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,824
     how was your first day
       at making waffles?

643
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,059
That would require a promotion.

644
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:16,360
     I am a server trainee.

645
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,730
         Okay, how much
  did my server trainee make?

646
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:24,702
    Adding up my hourly wage
    and taking into account
 the ruined shirt and slacks...

647
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,737
     I think I'm only down
          about $170.

648
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:30,307
    You actually lost money
   by going into work today?

649
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,309
     Startup costs, honey.

650
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,044
     Every business venture
      is steeped in them.

651
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:38,415
You might find this interesting.

652
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,719
          After seeing
      Mary's sales today,

653
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,754
          and assuming
  Jacqui did roughly the same,

654
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:46,423
        I was impressed
   with the revenue potential
       of the restaurant.

655
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:49,426
      I mean, considering
    Papa's is open 24 hours
    with three shifts a day,

656
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,261
     even if you factor in
           70% costs,

657
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,130
  it's still a healthy profit
        for the owners.

658
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:55,165
         More than both
   of our salaries combined.

659
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,301
  Well, my old salary anyway.

660
00:28:58,337 --> 00:28:59,470
    Yeah, it's interesting.

661
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,272
             What?

662
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,207
       You don't like it.

663
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:05,909
        You do like it?

664
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,847
      I missed something.

665
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:11,515
       Can I buy a vowel?

666
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:14,985
         Rhymes with...

667
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:17,755
             maybe.

668
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:22,059
             Baby.

669
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:24,828
        You're pregnant.

670
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,398
          You did it.

671
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,932
  No, well, you had something
         to do with it.

672
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,534
     I can't believe this.
           This is...

673
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:31,952
      This is so exciting.

674
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:33,369
     -Is that all you have?
 -No, this is really exciting.

675
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:34,538
           Come here.

676
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,944
          I love you.

677
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,813
          I love you.

678
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,948
 You know I'm terrified, right?

679
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,183
             I do.

680
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:47,284
       (laughing) I know.

681
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:53,991
 In nine months, we're gonna be
 up to our ears in burp cloths
       and dirty diapers.

682
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:55,259
        We're gonna have
       to buy a minivan.

683
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:57,094
     We're having a child,
       not a soccer team.

684
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:58,562
          Is it normal
   that I'm already thinking

685
00:29:58,564 --> 00:29:59,997
        about everything
      that could go wrong

686
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:01,465
 and everything we don't have?

687
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,101
   Yeah, I think it's called
        having a child.

688
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:05,536
 You sure we're ready for this?

689
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:09,807
You mean because at some point,
    I won't be able to work,

690
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:12,442
     and you're only making
         $2.13 an hour

691
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,911
           plus tips?

692
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,879
   Yes, that crossed my mind.

693
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,047
        Yeah, mine too.

694
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,391
              Jim:
I knew my enthusiasm for the job

695
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:29,226
        wouldn't make up
   for the lack of take-home.

696
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:32,229
      With a baby inbound,
I need to make some real money.

697
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,531
    $60 a shift wasn't gonna
       buy me much time.

698
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,366
            -Manuel.
     -Hey, what's up, man?

699
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,101
              Oh.

700
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,304
            (laughs)
        It's cool, man.

701
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:41,238
           It's cool.

702
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,176
              Hey!

703
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,612
          You the guy
          who slipped
     on his ass yesterday?

704
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,080
        Jim Adams, yes.

705
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:52,349
Yeah. Larry, assistant manager.

706
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,951
     Those the same shoes?

707
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,185
          Yes, but I--

708
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,154
  You know I can write you up
           for that.

709
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,122
       I did order a pair
       of Crewsave shoes
       from the catalog,

710
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:00,924
 but they take a while to ship.

711
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:03,026
         Consider this
      your verbal warning.
       You only get one.

712
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,597
        I thought Jacqui
   was the assistant manager.

713
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:09,066
  (sighs) There's the manager,

714
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,434
    two assistant managers,

715
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,469
     and the shift manager.

716
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,471
Well, I guess that ups the odds
   for promotion, doesn't it?

717
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:15,405
             Yeah.

718
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,007
        For some people.

719
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:20,077
         Any idea what
   I'm supposed to be doing?

720
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,879
          Ask Matthew.
       He's in the back.

721
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:32,222
           -Matthew?
        -He's out back.

722
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:40,498
            Matthew:
 I want us to talk about this.

723
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:41,999
             Woman:
     I'm not gonna sit here
 and talk to you about this...

724
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,270
         I can't stop!

725
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,171
    You can figure this out!

726
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,640
            -Nancy--
           -Whatever!

727
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:50,574
        Can we please--

728
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,252
            Matthew?

729
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,255
         You all right?

730
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,626
       You need anything?

731
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,167
 How about I just grab a bucket
   and start on the windows?

732
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:20,504
             Yeah.

733
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:38,622
    Jimmy Flops, back again.
           (chuckles)

734
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,257
   I can always count on you
          to be early.

735
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,676
  Anyone serious about his job
           would be.

736
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:45,094
   Jim, we're out of visors.
    I need everybody looking
    as hygienic as possible.

737
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:46,530
      Everybody listen up!

738
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:48,198
  Boss man is 10 minutes out.

739
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,734
    Last looks. Let's stash
     the cleaning supplies,

740
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:53,403
       and let's pretend
        we haven't been
 busing our humps all morning.

741
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,248
    Hey, what are you doing
wearing that stupid-looking hat?

742
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,217
       Management told me
        to keep it sexy.

743
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:10,187
          Just trying
     to fulfill the mandate
    the best way I know how.

744
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,522
         Then I say...

745
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:14,725
         you nailed it.

746
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:16,193
       Thank you, Kathy.

747
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,229
            Jacqui:
          There he is.

748
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:25,502
Every six weeks, like clockwork.

749
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,503
          That's Papa?

750
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,739
     Drake, Papa's protege.

751
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:31,541
         Hey, don't let
       the lack of polish
        fool you either.

752
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,076
            He's one
  of the richest guys in town.

753
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:35,178
You give that old man a 10 cent,

754
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,664
and he'll squeeze out a dollar.

755
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:40,149
    Jim: Miles Drake III was
      one of the original
       five franchisees.

756
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:41,468
      How's my favorite...

757
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:42,785
              Jim:
          In addition
  to his 10 Papa's locations,

758
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:45,555
   he also owned a tire shop
      and a beauty salon.

759
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:49,559
      Two artificial knees
didn't stop him from inspecting
  every inch of the building.

760
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:53,096
   No crevice was overlooked,
     no detail too minute.

761
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:56,066
    And just when I thought
   my admiration had reached
          its summit,

762
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,401
     he took to the grill.

763
00:33:57,403 --> 00:33:59,736
     Cooked his own Webster
  with a side of hash browns.

764
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:04,241
  Then sat down in booth seven
       to enjoy his lunch
  with a cup of coffee, black.

765
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,828
   Afterward, we were called
         into the back

766
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:10,480
     for what I anticipated
       to be a hard-nosed
     yet inspired critique.

767
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:13,250
  Well, I wanna thank you all
 for being here with me today.

768
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,121
      As many of you know,
 I'm not a man to waste words.

769
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:22,059
      It's been suggested
      that I slow down...

770
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,261
and I'm gonna take that advice.

771
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:26,463
     Now, this doesn't mean
       anything drastic.

772
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:30,600
       It just means that
    sometime in the future,
 I will cease to be your boss.

773
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:33,303
              Jim:
    No sooner had he said it
    than the idea struck me,

774
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:37,340
  so acute and clearly-defined
    I might only describe it
          as destiny.

775
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:40,477
    I just want you to know
 it's been an absolute pleasure
      to be your employer.

776
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,181
       So, get out there
    and sling some waffles.

777
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:48,718
       Let's do it, guys.
          Waffle time.

778
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,555
    -You've done a great job
        for me, Matthew.
        -Thank you, sir.

779
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,690
     Excuse me, Mr. Drake.

780
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,559
     -My name is Jim Adams.
           -Hi, Jim.

781
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:59,763
    Um, I just was wondering
 if I could have a moment to...
         speak to you.

782
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,400
I want you to look at something
  and tell me what you think.

783
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:11,541
         Please tell me
       you're not trying
       to buy a Ferrari.

784
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:15,312
     It's a franchising fee
        and down payment
for a Papa's Chicken and Waffle.

785
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:17,747
        More precisely,
     the location at which
    I am currently employed.

786
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,885
       Okay. Now, I wish
     this was about a car.

787
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:24,454
   I know it's intimidating.

788
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,225
           $335,000?

789
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,629
With the state of our mortgage,
        I can't imagine
     how we would do that.

790
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,498
        Don't you think
    this is a bit impulsive?

791
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
          I understand
      it could come across
       as ill-considered.

792
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:39,236
             -Good.
           -But I met
     the store owner today,

793
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,438
        and it could not
     have been more clear.

794
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,374
 -Don't you have to work there
      a year or something?
         -1,000 hours.

795
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:46,309
 But all corporate cares about
       is a gross total,

796
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,512
    which means I can tally
  as many hours as I can take.

797
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,814
       It's a huge risk.

798
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,816
        I wanna be a man
 that cooks his own breakfast.

799
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,317
 Honey, I could teach you that
          in an hour.

800
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,619
         We don't need
      to buy a restaurant.

801
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:57,721
  It's good, clean, hard work,

802
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,773
     and it's respectable.

803
00:35:59,774 --> 00:36:01,824
       It's endless hours
   and a mountain of stress.

804
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,293
My father ran his own business.

805
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:04,561
I'm not naive to what it takes.

806
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:07,297
        No, I... (sigh)
          I know that.

807
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,499
  This has a lot of potential.

808
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,234
   Yes, maybe it does, but...

809
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:13,470
      we can't afford it.

810
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:14,938
    We can take out a loan.

811
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:19,409
 Is this really what you want?

812
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,777
        A Papa's Waffle?

813
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:23,813
 Just come in and see it, okay?

814
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:26,316
    If you're not convinced,
 then I won't mention it again.

815
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,856
           You ready?

816
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:33,924
           Dazzle me.

817
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:37,427
     (conga music playing)

818
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,398
  Wow. Is it always like this?

819
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,699
       Jacqui: Jim! Jim!

820
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,701
     Oh, thank the almighty
          you're here.

821
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,536
         -What is this?
          -A wedding.

822
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,737
           Someone is
     getting married here?

823
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,539
     Happens all the time.

824
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,707
       I need your help.

825
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,874
     People are passionate
      about their Papa's.

826
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:57,280
        Look, we've got
  a critical toilet situation
  I need you to take care of.

827
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,750
  What do you mean "critical"?

828
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:02,219
 Child, the commode is clogged
       like a watermelon
       in a garden hose.

829
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:04,754
          I told them
     that double ply paper
        was a bad idea.

830
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:05,922
    The plunger didn't work?

831
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:08,225
 Stolen. That's the situation.

832
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:09,459
     Who steals a plunger?

833
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,294
   These people are savages.

834
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,096
         Do you want me
      to go buy a new one?

835
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,897
       Two more flushes,
and it's Niagara Falls in there.

836
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,833
            Welcome
  to the restaurant business.

837
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,972
 Not a problem. I'll handle it.

838
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,246
           Jimmy Jam.

839
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,481
  I wouldn't go in there raw.

840
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:53,370
            Oh! Wow!

841
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:55,905
  No. No. No, no, no, no, no.

842
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,912
           (exhaling)

843
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:06,349
       It's man up time.
       It's man up time.
       It's man up time.

844
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,685
      (exhaling nervously)

845
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,658
   It's time to man up, Jim.
      It's time to man up.

846
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:17,427
             Okay.

847
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:19,763
             Okay.

848
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:22,399
        All right, yeah,
      that's significant.

849
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:23,800
      That is significant.

850
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:25,769
           (exhaling)

851
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:33,777
    (shuddering in disgust)

852
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,684
              Ugh!

853
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:48,825
           (retching)

854
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,934
    Yeah, you can't beat me.

855
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,504
       You can't beat me.

856
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:06,443
  You... can't... beat... me.

857
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:08,745
              Jim:
     Come on, you bastard!

858
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:11,781
           (grunting)

859
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,051
          Sounds like
   he's got it under control.

860
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,086
       (toilet flushing)

861
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,031
 Sir, I believe you were next.

862
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,570
             -Yeah.
             -Yeah.

863
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:37,440
  That was unbelievably foul.

864
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,442
   And somehow, almost sexy.

865
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:42,445
Ooh, look like somebody's gonna
  be playing janitor tonight.

866
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,515
      Well, if that's what
 this place brings out of you,

867
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,050
     I think we should buy
         three of them.

868
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,885
      I just want the one.

869
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,420
         Yeah, that was
       hyperbole, honey.

870
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:51,821
             Okay.

871
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:54,023
   Well, if you'll excuse me,
      I'm gonna go, uh...

872
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,092
    bathe myself in bleach.

873
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,494
           Good idea.

874
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,464
  All right, you got your pen.
       You got your pad.

875
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:02,966
    -And you know your menu.
             -Yes.

876
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:05,034
       -You ready to go?
           -Bring it.

877
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,470
    All right, I don't think
 I've ever seen such potential.

878
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,106
    Hey, you give them hell,
           Jimmy Boy.

879
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:13,277
      This one is for you.

880
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,778
     -(rock music playing)
   -Look, you just give them
          a big smile

881
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,413
     and let them love you.
            Come on.

882
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,883
       We're rocking now.

883
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:26,423
           (chatter)

884
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,426
     I asked for a refill.

885
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:31,561
      Shoot! I'm so sorry.
     I'm on it. I'm on it.

886
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:33,096
       Yeah, that's what
      you said last time.

887
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,166
      I still need syrup.

888
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:37,867
  Okay, it's coming right up.

889
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,103
       Where's my straw?

890
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,604
    Straw, yes. You got it.

891
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,473
       -And my hot sauce.
          -Hot sauce.

892
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:44,874
         Table 15 wants
       their check, man.

893
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:46,075
     Just give me a second,
           all right?

894
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:48,978
      Yo, I said Webster.
        This is a Wally.

895
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,147
       -Okay, let me see
         what I can do.
   -Yeah, get me my Webster.

896
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:54,951
Hey, scrambled up. Table seven.

897
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,920
   Sunny side up. Table five.

898
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,557
      Jim, can I help you
         with anything?

899
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,159
     I need a refill on 12.
       13 wants a straw.
   Syrup for 14. Check on 15.

900
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:06,129
   Oh, and a... And a Webster
       not a Wally on 12.

901
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:07,931
     Jim, you just got sat
         on the patio.

902
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:09,883
        We have a patio?

903
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,834
      Okay, there was a...
    There was a box of them
          right here.

904
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,069
    -Now, they're not here.
          -Jim, baby.

905
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:15,205
        -I need straws.
     -Jim! Jim, look at me.

906
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:17,907
      It's okay. You're in
   what we call "the weeds."

907
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,943
   -I can't find the straws.
      -I know. It's okay.

908
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:21,878
       Look, we're gonna
get your section under control,

909
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,614
and then you're gonna take over
 the regulars at the high bar,
             okay?

910
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:26,149
       Give you a chance
   to take it easy for a bit.

911
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:27,884
      -Sound like a plan?
             -Yeah.

912
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:29,586
  Okay. All right, follow me.
          Look at me.

913
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:30,753
      Come on. It's okay.

914
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:34,224
           Excuse me.

915
00:41:34,226 --> 00:41:36,226
    I need a refill please.

916
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:38,228
           I got you.

917
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,229
   Man, Kathy, you're getting
   your $1.25's worth today.

918
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:42,065
    Like you're any better.

919
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:43,867
      Sitting around here
      waiting till you get
          a phone call

920
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,668
   to go repo someone's car.

921
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,238
          -(whistles)
     -And ruin their life.

922
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,573
       Yeah, been there,
        done that today.

923
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:51,875
   Made her cry and throw up.

924
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:54,010
That must have been really neat
       to see firsthand.

925
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,211
     No, you misunderstand.

926
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,080
        It didn't happen
     both at the same time.

927
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:59,115
       First, she cried,
   and then she... (laughing)

928
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:02,519
  She puked all over her car.

929
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:05,588
    You're right. That does
    make all the difference.

930
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,123
    Of course it does. Yeah.

931
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,292
      Well, man, I'm in it
    for the money, but hey,

932
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:12,562
     it's the little perks
   that make it so rewarding.

933
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:14,231
        Where's my food?

934
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:15,899
   Well, there's your Sprite.
   Your bacon is on its way.

935
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:17,200
        In the meantime,
    please enjoy your grits.

936
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,002
     This is unacceptable.

937
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:21,804
    I ain't putting my bacon
         in cold grits.

938
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:25,108
       I am really sorry.
      I will bring you out
 a fresh bowl with your bacon.

939
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,944
        I hope you know
         I ain't paying
    for this Sprite either.

940
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:30,179
      You gotta be faster
     if you wanna get paid.

941
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,850
   Ma'am, I desperately want
    you to enjoy your meal,

942
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:36,819
      but I need to know.
     Do you want your food
brought out promptly or slowly?

943
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:39,756
  What kind of stupid question
            is that?

944
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:41,958
      Well, I was too fast
        with your grits,

945
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,293
      and then the Sprite
         took too long,

946
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:44,661
and you started bitching at me.

947
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:46,480
            (scoffs)

948
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,298
     -What did you call me?
      -Uh-huh, waffle man.

949
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,869
         Jim: In 2008,
  financial institutions cost
 Americans trillions of dollars

950
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:55,405
        with little more
   than a slap on the wrist.

951
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,940
  Here, a tardy plate of bacon
         had turned me
    into a Jackson Pollock.

952
00:42:57,943 --> 00:43:00,310
      Whoa! Take it easy.
        He's still new.

953
00:43:00,312 --> 00:43:03,246
    Better watch his mouth,
       'cause next time,
 it's gonna be more than grits.

954
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,781
          Hey, Jimmy.

955
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:06,049
         Get over here.

956
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:13,222
         You do realize
     this is a business...

957
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:16,960
        and that we are
      completely dependent
     upon repeat clientele?

958
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:19,896
       Yes, I mishandled
         the situation.

959
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:21,998
         Sure, you did.

960
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,001
         But strangely,
that gives me some hope for you.

961
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:28,371
    But there ain't no point
     in you telling someone
         to go to hell

962
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,840
      when they're already
      on their way there.

963
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:32,375
             Now...

964
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,811
        this might take
some starch out of your collar,

965
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:36,846
  but you gotta make it right.

966
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,086
             Go on.

967
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:51,628
          Here you go.

968
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,929
             On me.

969
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:54,697
          It sure is.

970
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:59,669
          I apologize
  for my poor choice of words.

971
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:01,871
          It was wrong
  and not befitting of Papa's.

972
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:03,373
   You ain't getting no tip.

973
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,208
         Of course not.

974
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,709
        Enjoy your meal.

975
00:44:07,912 --> 00:44:10,046
       Here you go, Jim.

976
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:11,114
        Keep the change.

977
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:15,018
              Jim:
  The repo man always left me
     more than I deserved.

978
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,021
       He spent his days
     cleaning up the messes
       made by financiers

979
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:20,890
    who made loans to people
      who had no business
        receiving them.

980
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:22,425
         By cleaning up
      after the repo man,

981
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:24,894
   I had completed the circle
      of economic justice.

982
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:34,270
   Are you smoking pot, Jim?

983
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:35,204
              No.

984
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,373
    Maybe you should start.

985
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:41,110
 I want you to take that home.
    Give it a once-through.

986
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,347
   "From Ex-Con to Babylon."

987
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:48,451
    It's our etiquette guide
         to help felons
      who are having a...

988
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:51,454
   tough time re-acclimating
      into normal society.

989
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:52,855
   Is this really necessary?

990
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,291
    There's some good stuff
           in there.

991
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,893
        Read it a couple
        of times myself.

992
00:44:58,263 --> 00:44:59,962
         (sighs) Okay.

993
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:01,798
   A clean one on the house.

994
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:04,300
            Thanks.

995
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:07,036
            -(sighs)
            -(beeps)

996
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,015
  Jimmy D, hey, there's still
   a few customers in there.

997
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:22,385
  You sure you don't wanna try
       and add an omelet
        to those grits?

998
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,953
         I'm not really
      in the mood, Edward.

999
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:25,755
     Aw, come on now, man.

1000
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:26,489
            Hold up.

1001
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:29,759
      Hey, what do you do
         for exercise?

1002
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:32,412
           Exercise?

1003
00:45:32,413 --> 00:45:35,064
       Well, now, surely,
   you don't consider driving
  this car of yours a workout.

1004
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,500
    I, uh... I hit the gym.

1005
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:40,069
          Well, that's
     all I wanted to hear.
     You're coming with me.

1006
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,738
     Hey, you mind driving?

1007
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,172
       I'm still working
      on getting me a car.

1008
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:50,279
 Hey, hey, don't panic, Jimbo.

1009
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:52,782
   I promise to get you home
         in one piece.

1010
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,520
           (grunting)

1011
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:06,129
         Yeah. (laughs)

1012
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:07,363
     Hey, come on. Hit it.

1013
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,333
            -Hit...
          -Yeah. Yeah.

1014
00:46:11,336 --> 00:46:14,036
       Aw. Come on, man!

1015
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:16,372
      It's the grits girl.
        Give it to her.

1016
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:18,441
       -Grits girl? Okay.
        -Yeah, go ahead.

1017
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:23,479
          Whoa. Whoa.

1018
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:26,082
      Whoa. Take it easy.
  Take it easy. You all right?

1019
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:27,016
             Yeah.

1020
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:28,317
           -You sure?
             -Yeah.

1021
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,990
       (Edward grunting)

1022
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:36,559
           (exhales)
          Yeah, baby.

1023
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:39,562
   Hey, how's that eye, huh?

1024
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:42,131
         Oh, it's fine.

1025
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,467
    Oh, good. It takes time.

1026
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:47,236
        You know, my dad
       started me boxing
         when I was 10.

1027
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:49,505
   He taught me to cook, too.

1028
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:53,075
   About the only two things
 he showed me worth repeating.

1029
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,814
    I heard you're thinking
    about buying the Papa's.

1030
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:01,050
        You heard right.

1031
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:03,085
        Don't take this
     the wrong way, Jimmy,

1032
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:05,021
but beyond working the register,

1033
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:07,990
         I wouldn't say
     you had much aptitude
      toward the business.

1034
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:10,459
  I'm only 121 hours in here,
            Edward.

1035
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:13,496
  I guess I'm trying to figure
out why you're putting yourself
          through it.

1036
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:16,465
      Because it's tough,
        and it's honest,

1037
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:19,468
  and it's the furthest thing
     from what I was doing.

1038
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:23,239
   Let me tell you something.
    I've been working there
        almost 10 years.

1039
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:26,042
             Okay?

1040
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,844
           I've heard
    a lot of people talk big
about getting their own Papa's.

1041
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:33,149
         But never once
  has any one of them done it.

1042
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,955
          Let me have
   another crack at that bag.

1043
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:43,860
            (laughs)
           Go ahead.

1044
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:45,995
-It's a little bit heavier, huh?
   -Yeah, yeah, it's heavier.

1045
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:46,996
   Keep your head right here.

1046
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:49,599
            Edward:
         Hey! (laughs)

1047
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:51,500
          My main man!

1048
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:53,402
             -Dad!
             -Hey!

1049
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:55,271
       -That's your son?
             -Yeah.

1050
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:56,422
        He's so little.

1051
00:47:56,423 --> 00:47:57,572
            You know
   they come that way, right?

1052
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,175
            I guess
   I'll find out soon enough.

1053
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:01,143
         I didn't know
      you were expecting.

1054
00:48:01,145 --> 00:48:03,246
    Well, we haven't exactly
     gone wide with it yet.

1055
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:05,615
 I tell you, it's not so easy,

1056
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:07,416
       but it's worth it.

1057
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:08,951
       Most of the time.

1058
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:10,319
         All the time.

1059
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:12,388
  (laughs) Yeah, all the time.

1060
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,957
   "Great achievement is born
      of great sacrifice."

1061
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:16,893
             -Hmm.
   -Napoleon Hill said that.

1062
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,494
 Hmm. Sounds like a smart dude.

1063
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,898
        -All right, man,
      thanks for the ride.
          -All right.

1064
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,067
      Hey, I will see you
       on the front line.

1065
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,903
    Come on, baby. Come on.

1066
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:37,113
   Jim: Up until this point,
     my whole life had been
      one of accumulation.

1067
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:40,983
I had always thought of this car
   as a symbol for who I was
    and who I wanted to be,

1068
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:43,419
    and now, that's exactly
  why I was going to sell it.

1069
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,289
       If I truly wanted
        this restaurant,
 I had to put skin in the game,

1070
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,590
         a lot of skin.

1071
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:48,991
       Maybe even a leg.

1072
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:52,628
          -Becky: Hey.
             -Hey.

1073
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,363
       Whose car is that?

1074
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:55,398
             Mine.

1075
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,099
       -Where's your car?
          -I sold it.

1076
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:59,402
      Is that a black eye?

1077
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:00,937
     Edward took me boxing.

1078
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:01,938
        Did he hit you?

1079
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,372
        No, not exactly.

1080
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:06,042
     It's hard to explain.
 It's called a double-end bag.

1081
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:07,627
   Yeah, I know what that is.

1082
00:49:07,628 --> 00:49:09,211
   It was this freak accident
    equipment failure thing.

1083
00:49:09,213 --> 00:49:11,981
       The bag came back
     and, uh... struck me.

1084
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:14,250
      So you hit yourself?

1085
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:19,288
   The point being I realized
     that if we really want
  to purchase this restaurant,

1086
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,691
        we're gonna have
    to make some sacrifices.

1087
00:49:21,693 --> 00:49:24,460
I mean, a full lifestyle change.

1088
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,330
  Well, as long as it doesn't
      include you becoming
     a professional boxer,

1089
00:49:27,332 --> 00:49:28,564
     I think we'll be fine.

1090
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:30,733
       Becky, I'm talking
        about the house.

1091
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,503
          -The house?
             -Yeah.

1092
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,672
              No.

1093
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:41,444
        No, no, no, no.
  We're not selling the house.
         Are you crazy?

1094
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:43,713
    -You've been there what?
          Three weeks?
     -Just... hear me out.

1095
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:46,248
     I talked to Mr. Drake,
    and he helped me realize

1096
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,117
      it was the only way
        we're ever gonna
     accrue enough equity.

1097
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,252
       Well, that's good
   that Mr. Drake is on board
    with selling the house.

1098
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:52,355
        Did you ask him
 if we should sell my car too?

1099
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:54,991
              Jim!

1100
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:57,326
       I love this house.

1101
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,594
      You love this house.

1102
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:00,947
         I know. I do.

1103
00:50:00,948 --> 00:50:03,299
   But there is no guarantee
         the restaurant
 will be profitable right away.

1104
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:05,067
        This mortgage is
     already outpacing us.

1105
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:07,036
        We can't have it
    hanging over our heads.

1106
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,605
            (sighs)

1107
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:12,441
    I thought we were gonna
raise our family in this house.

1108
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:15,328
   I know it's a lot to ask,

1109
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:17,279
      and if I could make
      the numbers come out
    any other way, I would.

1110
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:18,214
        Believe me. I--

1111
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:20,516
           I just...

1112
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,186
    I just need to get out.
    I need to go for a drive
         or something.

1113
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,388
         Becky. Becky.

1114
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,156
       I need some time.

1115
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:49,745
          Jim: It took
    four nights on the couch
 and a trip to the chiropractor

1116
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:51,580
    before she acknowledged
         my existence.

1117
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:54,350
     All things considered,
        I got off easy.

1118
00:51:01,092 --> 00:51:03,459
      Can I start you off
       with some coffee,
   orange juice, or hot tea?

1119
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:07,329
         You can start
      by slowing it down.
     We just got the menus.

1120
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:19,275
            (beeps)

1121
00:51:19,277 --> 00:51:21,377
        (alarm beeping)

1122
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:30,152
       We've got a buyer.
       We've got a sale!

1123
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:32,321
Winnie and a Wheeler coming up.

1124
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:33,689
             Okay.

1125
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:36,492
     -You doing all right?
     -Got it under control.

1126
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,395
       (plates breaking)

1127
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,266
      Need another Wheeler
          on the fly.

1128
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,269
            (beeps)

1129
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:53,209
        (alarm beeping)

1130
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:15,431
         Put your hands
       on the Bible now.

1131
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:21,504
     Ladies and gentlemen,
        I give you Billy
        and Mary Crohns!

1132
00:52:21,506 --> 00:52:23,305
        Kiss the bride!

1133
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,573
           (cheering)

1134
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:26,442
       (exclaims) I quit!

1135
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:46,529
  Jim, how much is the Wanda?

1136
00:52:47,899 --> 00:52:49,732
        $9.72 with tax.

1137
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,738
       Could I borrow $5?

1138
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,239
       How much you got?

1139
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:58,174
             Um...

1140
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:01,911
             $4.85.

1141
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:03,846
 Well, $5 would get you there.

1142
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:04,880
             Yeah.

1143
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,453
  All right, when do you wanna
          pay me back?

1144
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:16,559
      How about next week?

1145
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:21,931
             Deal.

1146
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:24,833
        Thank you, Jim.

1147
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:26,702
       You have my word.

1148
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,337
     I know where you eat.

1149
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:36,512
             Wanda.

1150
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:37,813
        Hey, Jimmy, man.

1151
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:40,716
 Did you just lend Kathy money?

1152
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:41,784
           $5, yeah.

1153
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:44,820
   You can kiss that goodbye.

1154
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:47,256
    Said she'd pay me back.

1155
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:50,359
    She owes a couple bucks
  to everybody in this place.

1156
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:52,695
         You know she's
  a little whacked out, right?

1157
00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:54,763
     She's eccentric, sure.

1158
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:02,571
     She gets electroshock
          every week.

1159
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,908
She's been riding that lightning
     for the past 18 years.

1160
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:09,578
         That explains
     the earmuffs in July.

1161
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,580
             Yeah.

1162
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,917
    Well, if that's the way
     you've been investing
people's money all these years,

1163
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:17,820
    maybe you are better off
           at Papa's.

1164
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:24,560
        Who's Boss Hogg?

1165
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:27,363
  A franchisee out of Austin.

1166
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:29,331
  Checking out the restaurant.

1167
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:30,699
        This restaurant?

1168
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:32,718
        You're kidding.

1169
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:34,736
         No, I believe
       he's real serious.

1170
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:38,574
    Well, it was a pleasure,
           Big Jake.

1171
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:39,942
 It's good talking to you too,
            Matthew.

1172
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:40,876
          -All right.
          -Thank you.

1173
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,746
         Uh, excuse me.

1174
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:45,514
 I couldn't help but overhear.

1175
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:47,016
        You're thinking
    about buying the place.

1176
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:50,286
      This'll be my third.
       I already got two
         back in Texas.

1177
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:52,021
 Wouldn't mind going national.

1178
00:54:52,023 --> 00:54:53,489
      I love that bravery.

1179
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:54,990
I hope you have a good tax man.

1180
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,642
       Compared to Texas,

1181
00:54:56,643 --> 00:54:58,293
         this state is
      about as hospitable
      as communist Russia.

1182
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,062
           (laughing)
           Why, sure,

1183
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:01,864
        I got a tax guy.

1184
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:04,433
       In a former life,
  I was VP at Alpha Managers.

1185
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:06,435
    No doubt you're familiar
     with our Texas branch.

1186
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:08,604
  I think we were number three
          in the area.

1187
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:09,538
         I'm Jim Adams.

1188
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:12,841
        Jacob Masterson.
       Call me Big Jake.

1189
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:16,312
        All right, well,
 tax codes can be a bit tricky
     around here, Big Jake.

1190
00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:18,614
   See, once a business hits
       a 250K threshold,

1191
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:21,483
  municipality and state taxes
       can run up to 15%.

1192
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,952
      -I didn't know that.
 -Yeah, not a lot of people do.

1193
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:26,922
  The trick is to aggressively
    depreciate fixed assets
      on your tax return.

1194
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:28,424
     But if you don't know
       what you're doing,

1195
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:30,426
       you can get mired
 in a nasty audit very quickly.

1196
00:55:30,428 --> 00:55:32,995
  -Oh, audits! I had the feds.
       -Tell me about it.

1197
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,964
     But hey, you got a guy
   inside the State Attorney
       General's Office,

1198
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,800
            I'm sure
    you'll probably be fine.

1199
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:39,601
   Good, old Uncle Sam, huh?

1200
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:41,637
    Once he starts nibbling,
  he just can't help himself.

1201
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:43,839
 He wants the whole damn thing,
          every time.

1202
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:45,391
You know what I'm talking about.

1203
00:55:45,392 --> 00:55:46,942
        All right, well,
 I gotta get back on the floor.

1204
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:48,911
  Best of luck with all this.
           Sincerely.

1205
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:50,546
        Hey, appreciate
       the insight, Jim.

1206
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:51,547
          -Thank you.
          -You got it.

1207
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:56,085
      He flew out of there
 as if just being in the state
  was gonna trigger an audit.

1208
00:55:56,087 --> 00:55:58,020
      It worked perfectly.

1209
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,954
      It's gonna take you
       another two months
      to reach your hours.

1210
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:00,989
      Did you call Drake?

1211
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:02,391
      Directly afterward.

1212
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:04,460
He said Big Jake happened to be
          in the area,

1213
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:06,829
and heard about the restaurants
       being up for sale,
  and decided to have a look.

1214
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:09,131
  Well, did he sound sincere?

1215
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:10,966
         He assured me
     that we're at the top
          of his list,

1216
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:13,435
       and everyone else
         at this point
      is just a looky-loo.

1217
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:14,903
      He said "looky-loo"?

1218
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:16,538
    It's not a term I'd use.

1219
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,973
          Okay, well,
   we need to speed this up.

1220
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:19,708
            I mean,
  we sold our house for this.

1221
00:56:20,644 --> 00:56:22,511
      Couldn't agree more.

1222
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:24,813
           Tomorrow,
    I'm dropping the hammer.

1223
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:28,951
     Have you seen Matthew?

1224
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:30,652
           -Freezer.
            -Thanks.

1225
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:36,509
        Is that a 401K?

1226
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:38,627
 Mm-hmm. My husband is thinking
      about cashing it in.

1227
00:56:38,629 --> 00:56:40,396
 It's a little early for that,
           isn't it?

1228
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:41,897
   You'd take a big tax hit.

1229
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,065
 Yeah, we don't have a choice.

1230
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,733
   Trying to get our daughter
          to college.

1231
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:45,968
        You mind if I...

1232
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,870
      Oh, yeah, please do.

1233
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:52,808
       Tell your husband
  to max out his contribution.

1234
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,627
       They'll match him
       dollar for dollar.

1235
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:56,445
     Wait. They'll do that?
  Nobody ever mentioned that.

1236
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:58,480
         They never do.
    You have to know to ask.

1237
00:56:58,482 --> 00:57:00,466
      And I would take out
        education loans

1238
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:02,451
   that don't accrue interest
until your daughter is finished
      with her schooling,

1239
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:04,720
          which should
    give you four years, six
 if she goes for her master's,

1240
00:57:04,722 --> 00:57:07,022
          to build up
    a nice, little nest egg.

1241
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:08,590
         -Thanks, Jim.
       -Yeah, no problem.

1242
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:11,760
Hey, Matthew, you got a minute?

1243
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:14,496
        Yeah, just doing
      a little inventory.

1244
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:17,132
       -I can come back.
         -No, come on.

1245
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:19,134
      Well, I was thinking
    about that 1,000 hours,

1246
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:21,670
     and how it's taking me
  a significant amount of time
          to complete.

1247
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:23,472
     Yeah, how can I help.

1248
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:25,607
       I need more hours.

1249
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,976
  Eye of the tiger. I like it.

1250
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:28,911
      How many we talking?

1251
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,179
            Doubles.

1252
00:57:30,181 --> 00:57:34,483
  Oh, you think you can handle
 16 hours a day in this place?

1253
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:36,518
        I used to do it
          all the time
         at my old job.

1254
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,453
        (Matthew sighs)

1255
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:39,955
   All I got is third shift.

1256
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,857
      Great. I'll take it.

1257
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,561
         -Third shift?
             -Yeah.

1258
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:46,495
          Hell itself?

1259
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:51,934
      Well, if it gets me
    to 1,000 hours quicker,
            I, uh...

1260
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:53,969
    I don't care what it is.
          I'll do it.

1261
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:57,206
         You got balls
  the size of cantaloupe, Jim.

1262
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:58,207
      I'll give you that.

1263
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,010
              Jim:
          Waffle fact.

1264
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:04,480
    Third shift takes place
  from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.,

1265
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:06,215
   and as I quickly learned,

1266
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:07,949
       has nothing to do
      with serving patrons
       and earning tips.

1267
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:10,336
      It's a battleground,

1268
00:58:10,337 --> 00:58:12,721
     a nightly reenactment
    of 250 Texans defending
     an old Spanish mission

1269
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:15,057
    against the Mexican army
    10 times their strength.

1270
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:16,558
 The bars let out at 2:00 a.m.,

1271
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,193
          and by 2:30,
   we are completely besieged

1272
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:21,797
    by the drunk, the loud,
   and the clinically insane.

1273
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:23,098
          Uh, just...

1274
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:26,235
              Man:
    Be honest with me, baby.

1275
00:58:26,237 --> 00:58:28,637
    Do I have great tits...

1276
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:30,606
          (indistinct)

1277
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:33,742
  Sure, she had a tight body,

1278
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:35,711
    but the girl is missing
        too many teeth.

1279
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:37,880
            Oh, no.

1280
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,583
     I like chicken curry.

1281
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:44,620
     You can't handle this.
     You can't handle this.

1282
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:49,558
         -What up, kid?
   -Hang on one second, okay.

1283
00:58:50,294 --> 00:58:51,927
             -Hey.
             -Yeah.

1284
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:53,629
       -He just got here.
         -Okay, great.

1285
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,966
      (slurring, mumbling)

1286
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:59,902
        He wants to know
        if he can order.

1287
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:00,936
     I don't know. Can he?

1288
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,850
    People here are talking
        about you, man.

1289
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,553
      Say you used to work
    at a bank or something.

1290
00:59:18,923 --> 00:59:20,289
 People have their facts wrong.

1291
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:24,126
        What did you do?

1292
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:25,627
    I used to blow up banks.

1293
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:27,896
          No kidding?

1294
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:30,566
         I had a cousin
     who used to rob banks.

1295
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:33,268
  I didn't say I robbed them.
        I blew them up.

1296
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,904
        My buddies and I
  convinced the bank officers
      to give us the money

1297
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:38,674
         which we used
   to buy bad mortgage bonds.

1298
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:40,208
    And that's what it means
       to blow up a bank.

1299
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:45,847
       That's tough, man.

1300
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:50,285
           Stick it.

1301
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:53,021
           Thank you.

1302
00:59:55,726 --> 00:59:57,993
          Didn't know
     you were in the club.

1303
00:59:57,995 --> 00:59:59,094
           What club?

1304
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,929
   You, me, and Edward, man,

1305
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,264
        we all did time.

1306
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:03,632
            Edward?

1307
01:00:03,634 --> 01:00:06,368
      Yeah, man, 27 years.

1308
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,369
           For what?

1309
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:10,973
         I don't know.

1310
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,875
         He won't say.

1311
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,211
            Manuel.

1312
01:00:17,348 --> 01:00:19,948
     I never did any time.

1313
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,050
          (chuckling)
       One bad ass mofo.

1314
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:23,619
       Blowing up banks.

1315
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:25,871
          Hey, Larry,
  drop me two scatter, please.

1316
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,122
       I can't hear you.
 Are you standing on the bird?
    'Cause I can't hear you.

1317
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:50,212
     Hey, Jimmy Jambalaya.

1318
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:51,747
How's that double treating you?

1319
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:54,282
 Nine hours down, eight to go.

1320
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:56,718
      Yeah, I'm surprised
you made it through third shift
          without me.

1321
01:00:57,788 --> 01:01:00,539
        It wasn't easy,
         but I managed.

1322
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:03,291
   Well, I doubt if it lasts.
 I don't see you going too far
    without my hand-holding.

1323
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:07,663
       What do you think
 about me taking a little spin
         on that grill?

1324
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:10,999
           My grill?

1325
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:13,201
     With your supervision,
           of course.

1326
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:14,169
              Hmm.

1327
01:01:15,439 --> 01:01:17,139
   What do you have in mind?

1328
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:20,976
        I always wanted
       to make an omelet.

1329
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:22,678
           An omelet.

1330
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,412
              Huh.

1331
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:27,049
   Why don't we start you out
       with hash browns?

1332
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:31,853
  There's only so much damage
you can do with a grated potato.

1333
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:32,788
            Come on.

1334
01:01:35,325 --> 01:01:37,092
    All right, there. Now...

1335
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:40,228
        add your cheese
  and whatever else you want.

1336
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,464
         But your focus
     is on the hash brown.

1337
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:45,033
Keep it crispy. Keep it golden.

1338
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,370
       Total is $489.60.

1339
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:54,409
  I'm sorry. That didn't take.

1340
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:55,977
              Hmm.

1341
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:58,146
              Oh!

1342
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:00,182
           You okay?

1343
01:02:01,118 --> 01:02:03,185
       Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
         I'm all right.

1344
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:04,920
         I just, uh...
    Let's just try this one.

1345
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:08,223
       (exhales) (winces)

1346
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:11,960
         Oh! (stammers)

1347
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:14,362
         Do you need me
      to call an ambulance
         or something?

1348
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:18,333
        No. No, no, no.
      I'm okay. Thank you.

1349
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:23,839
            (winces)

1350
01:02:31,815 --> 01:02:33,849
       I think I'm ready
         for an omelet.

1351
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:35,984
 No, not today. Maybe tomorrow.

1352
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:39,121
      -Yeah, that looks...
     -He says I'm not ready
         for an omelet.

1353
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:40,822
       (tires screeching)

1354
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:45,327
 Baby, what are you doing here?

1355
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:47,896
         -I already had
    a lawyer draft them up.
             -Babe.

1356
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:49,264
   Are you out of your mind?
          I'm at work.

1357
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:50,432
  Oh, yeah? You wanna be here?

1358
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:51,967
Then you can be here without me.

1359
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,936
         I'm not living
       like this anymore.

1360
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,904
   -I'm trying to put a roof
         over our head.
 -I can't stand being near you.

1361
01:02:55,906 --> 01:02:58,774
 I can't stand looking at you.

1362
01:02:58,776 --> 01:03:00,208
       It's embarrassing.

1363
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,943
       -Nancy, listen...
       -You're pathetic.

1364
01:03:03,147 --> 01:03:04,546
             -Hey.
       -Don't follow me!

1365
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:07,015
          -Hey, Nancy.
      -Stay away from me!

1366
01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:08,483
        Don't follow me!

1367
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:09,551
      What did I do wrong?

1368
01:03:09,553 --> 01:03:11,119
      (arguing continues)

1369
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:27,035
    Come on. You can't leave
    in the middle of a shift
           like that.

1370
01:03:27,037 --> 01:03:29,271
     It's not professional.

1371
01:03:29,273 --> 01:03:31,139
         He'll be back.

1372
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:34,943
  Jim: That was the last time
       any of us ever saw
        Matthew Linslow.

1373
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:36,845
        I can't imagine
    anything more depressing

1374
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:38,513
       than being dumped
   by your wife of six years

1375
01:03:38,515 --> 01:03:40,916
       in the parking lot
of a Papa's Chicken and Waffle.

1376
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:42,150
           Oh, crap!

1377
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:53,428
  Well, first off, I wanna say
     that the baby is fine.

1378
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:57,465
     But what we can see is
       that the placenta
     is partially detached,

1379
01:03:57,467 --> 01:04:00,936
which is why you're experiencing
         the discomfort
      and heavy spotting.

1380
01:04:00,938 --> 01:04:04,072
So the most important thing now
    is to get lots of rest,

1381
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:07,075
      which means no work,
          no exercise,

1382
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:09,044
           and avoid
   any stressful situations.

1383
01:04:14,585 --> 01:04:16,852
    Well, there goes my job.

1384
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:19,554
    Hey. I'm working on it.

1385
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:22,290
        Jim, I need you
      to be there for me.

1386
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,259
      I need you to answer
          when I call.

1387
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:28,129
         You're working
     more than you ever did
           at Alpha.

1388
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:31,499
        I'm sorry, Beck.

1389
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:33,268
       Forget the store.

1390
01:04:34,605 --> 01:04:36,137
         What about us?

1391
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:39,908
   Is this how it's gonna be
    when you own the place?

1392
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:40,642
              No.

1393
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:43,111
    No, it's not. I promise.

1394
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:46,274
              Jim.

1395
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:49,511
       What are you doing
    eating at the high bar?

1396
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:54,115
  You're never supposed to eat
    on the restaurant floor
          in uniform.

1397
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,518
    It looks unprofessional
       to the customers.

1398
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,971
You're absolutely right, Larry,

1399
01:05:58,972 --> 01:06:01,423
and the minute I see a customer,
     I'll be sure to abide
        by that policy.

1400
01:06:03,994 --> 01:06:05,961
      Don't disrespect me.

1401
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:07,495
      I'm the manager now.

1402
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:09,297
      I will write you up.

1403
01:06:12,336 --> 01:06:14,336
              Jim:
      Much to our dismay,

1404
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:16,337
  Larry Coble had both server
     and grill experience,

1405
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:19,607
         which made him
       the only candidate
     eligible for the job.

1406
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:22,077
      Edward joined Jacqui
    as an assistant manager,

1407
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,396
    and in a surprise twist,

1408
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,714
       four-time rehire,
       Mrs. Mary Crohns,
 was promoted to shift manager

1409
01:06:26,717 --> 01:06:28,984
         based entirely
   on her accumulated hours.

1410
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,587
           First off,
       let's welcome Mary
       back to the team.

1411
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:34,556
          -(applause)
        -Thanks, y'all.

1412
01:06:34,558 --> 01:06:36,591
      Now, let's get down
          to business.

1413
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:41,296
        As we all know,
  Matthew was more interested
       in making friends

1414
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:42,664
          than he was
    in running a restaurant.

1415
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:46,368
      Well... I don't need
        any new friends.

1416
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:50,538
          What I need
  is written on these sheets.

1417
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:53,141
Let's go through them together,
             okay?

1418
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:56,211
    Jim, why don't you read
     the first one for us?

1419
01:06:58,382 --> 01:07:01,082
 "Servers will not eat anywhere
  other than the break room."

1420
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:04,085
 Let's hope that one sinks in.

1421
01:07:04,087 --> 01:07:05,420
              Hmm?

1422
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:07,088
              Jim:
    It pains me to admit it,

1423
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,174
      but I couldn't wait
        to buy the place

1424
01:07:09,175 --> 01:07:11,259
      just so I could see
    the look on Larry's face
       when I fired him.

1425
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:14,195
        Just let me know
if you need anything else, okay?

1426
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,597
         You guys just
     have a seat wherever.

1427
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:16,531
    I'll be right with you.

1428
01:07:18,035 --> 01:07:19,367
           All right.

1429
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:22,137
        -A coffee here.
          -Thank you.

1430
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:23,405
         A coffee here.

1431
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,574
     Working on your MBAs?

1432
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:31,479
           Uh, yeah,
  we have a big exam tomorrow.

1433
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:34,482
         Look at that,
     profitability ratios.
      That's my specialty.

1434
01:07:34,484 --> 01:07:36,217
         Need any help?

1435
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,820
            Thanks,
  but it's pretty complicated.

1436
01:07:38,822 --> 01:07:40,722
    Aw, I wouldn't say that.

1437
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:42,457
          I used to be
    in the business myself.

1438
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:44,225
         Good for you.

1439
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:46,127
  I worked at Alpha Managers.

1440
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:49,497
             -What?
     -You worked at Alpha?

1441
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:51,883
  Well, not really important.

1442
01:07:51,884 --> 01:07:54,268
       Let's get you two
      a healthy meal, huh?
  Big test coming up and all.

1443
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:56,438
       Can I interest you
in some chocolate chip waffles?

1444
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,207
    -No, the coffee is fine.

1445
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:00,175
          No problem.

1446
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:01,176
             Wait.

1447
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:02,710
         What happened?

1448
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:04,646
    What happened with what?

1449
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:06,481
         Come on, man.

1450
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:07,549
          With Alpha.

1451
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,284
Yeah, why are you working here?

1452
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,155
         I know, right?

1453
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:17,225
    It... makes you wonder.
            I, uh...

1454
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:19,661
   I grew up in the suburbs.

1455
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:21,196
    I went to a prep school.

1456
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:22,831
            I became
 a debt trafficking financier.

1457
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,566
    I would just hate to see
       what would happen

1458
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,300
          if I grew up
   on the wrong side of town,
           you know?

1459
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:30,505
           See this?

1460
01:08:30,507 --> 01:08:31,706
        Best thing that
      ever happened to me.

1461
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,809
   Good luck on those exams.

1462
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:39,814
             Posse?

1463
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:42,250
     Worse. It's me at 22.

           Hey, babe.

1469
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:04,405
 Yeah. Yeah, my break is over.
  Just got a little power nap.

1470
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:06,808
            Uh-huh.

1471
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,778
 Yeah, thanks for waking me up.
     I'll see you tonight.

           Looks like
     you've been rode hard
       and put away wet.

1476
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:22,557
             Well,
  after 350 hours this month,

1477
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,325
     that's actually better
          than I feel.

1478
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:27,395
    You're on a red-hot burn
      to the finish line.

1479
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:29,597
 Hey, boss man at six o'clock.

1480
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:32,867
-What do you mean you're tired?
          -Go to work!

1481
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:34,335
      -Give me my jacket.
       -Get out of here!

1482
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,336
        -What are you--
       -Get out of here!

1483
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:42,777
            That is
   one extremely hard woman,
         I'll tell you.

1484
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:43,945
       She do that often?

1485
01:09:43,947 --> 01:09:46,948
     Yeah. I seen his kids
        slap on him too.

1486
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:53,321
      Is there some reason
 you're not wearing your apron?

1487
01:09:54,257 --> 01:09:56,424
          Oh. Uh, no.

1488
01:09:56,426 --> 01:09:58,693
 I should always be in uniform
     when I'm on the floor.
       Sorry about that.

1489
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:02,764
         (door opening)

1490
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:06,401
 This is your seventh location.

1491
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:08,803
-The parking lot has 55 spaces.
  -(speaking foreign language)

1492
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:09,904
  Welcome to Papa's. How many?

1493
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:12,207
     Oh, we're not eating.
           Thank you.

1494
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:16,511
   -Gross income was $967,000
           last year.
  -(speaking foreign language)

1495
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:19,547
     Hi. Welcome. Welcome.

1496
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,982
 Hope you're enjoying America.

1497
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:22,750
    Excuse me. Who are you?

1498
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:24,652
 I'm Larry Coble, the manager.

1499
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:26,287
          Okay, great.

1500
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:28,590
       Just not so close
   to the clients. Thank you.

1501
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:30,358
      Right, okay. Sorry.

1502
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,794
       So, should I show
     everyone around or...

1503
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:34,362
     I know the floor plan.
           Thank you.

1504
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:36,147
       This way, please.

1505
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,931
    -The beverage center...
  -(speaking foreign language)

1506
01:10:39,269 --> 01:10:40,501
          Who is that?

1507
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:41,736
        The new owners.

1508
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:43,638
             What?

1509
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,773
      Move out of the way.
    Get back to your tables.

1510
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,477
        The building has
    a maximum capacity of...

1511
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:50,645
  Does Drake know about this?

1512
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:53,381
        Who do you think
   sold it to them, jackass?

1513
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:55,583
        It has received
     an A health rating...

1514
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,464
         Receptionist:
       Sorry, Mr. Drake.

1515
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:11,366
     It's all right, Ellie.

1516
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:12,667
          Hello, Jim.

1517
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:14,435
          I can't say
   I'm surprised to see you.

1518
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:22,877
       You can't tell me
        those new owners
    have logged 1,000 hours.

1519
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,979
     Okay, they can't even
         speak English.

1520
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:26,848
      And that 1,000 hours
       is a prerequisite.

1521
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:29,084
           I read it
 in the Rise and Shine manual.

1522
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:31,319
      I know what it says
         in the manual.
 I helped write the damn thing.

1523
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:32,654
      And why do you think
         it says that?

1524
01:11:32,656 --> 01:11:34,355
        Quality control.

1525
01:11:34,357 --> 01:11:36,691
      Surely, you can't be
          that naive.

1526
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:39,594
    Those criteria are about
  eliminating the competition,

1527
01:11:39,596 --> 01:11:41,062
not about bolstering the ranks.

1528
01:11:41,064 --> 01:11:45,500
      If it was that easy,
      there'd be a Papa's
       every three feet.

1529
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:48,303
          Do you think
 I actually put in 1,000 hours?

1530
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:49,604
I believed everything you said.

1531
01:11:49,606 --> 01:11:51,706
   You let me sell my house.

1532
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:55,843
     And you never intended
for me to acquire the restaurant
      in the first place.

1533
01:11:55,845 --> 01:11:58,079
       That is not true.

1534
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,648
         In you, I saw
     an ambitious young man

1535
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,850
       who wanted to buy
       one of my stores,

1536
01:12:02,852 --> 01:12:04,819
and if it would have worked out,
  I would have sold it to you.

1537
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,754
            You mean
    if I was the only buyer.

1538
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:09,757
           You know,
     modest as it may seem,

1539
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:13,027
  I consider these restaurants
           my legacy.

1540
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:16,531
    These people own several
  successful chains worldwide.

1541
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:19,667
     They're buying all 10.
 It's an 8-figure deal for me.

1542
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:20,735
            (sighs)

1543
01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:22,837
            (scoffs)

1544
01:12:25,342 --> 01:12:26,641
        I misjudged you.

1545
01:12:28,378 --> 01:12:29,577
          How's that?

1546
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:33,948
   I was under the impression
  you were a man of integrity.

1547
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:40,922
 My mother and father were both
  passionate business people.

1548
01:12:42,092 --> 01:12:43,858
   They had me late in life.

1549
01:12:45,095 --> 01:12:46,861
    Pop had his tire store.

1550
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,863
   Mom had her beauty parlor.

1551
01:12:49,799 --> 01:12:55,436
 They worked their entire lives
        in those stores,
      long, arduous hours.

1552
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:57,672
   And what did it get them?
            Nothing.

1553
01:12:57,674 --> 01:13:00,675
         They both died
   broken down and mediocre.

1554
01:13:01,644 --> 01:13:03,611
      I'm not doing that,

1555
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:05,446
  and this deal guarantees it.

1556
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:07,982
You'd still be rich without it.

1557
01:13:09,519 --> 01:13:10,985
     I'd rather be richer.

1558
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,655
   Yeah, of course you would.

1559
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:17,859
       Don't be a child.
     You're a businessman.

1560
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:19,994
      It's simple numbers.

1561
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,898
        It doesn't have
  anything to do with numbers.

1562
01:13:45,822 --> 01:13:47,088
              Jim:
          Waffle fact.

1563
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:50,625
      Miles Drake III was
    completely full of shit.

1564
01:13:58,701 --> 01:14:00,768
          (screaming)

1565
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,212
          (door opens)

1566
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:13,214
           Hey, babe.

1567
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:24,192
           Rough day?

1568
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:41,542
        It's all right.

1569
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:43,678
        Whatever it is,
      we'll figure it out.

1570
01:14:56,059 --> 01:14:57,492
      Hey, where's Edward?

1571
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:58,259
          Transferred.

1572
01:14:58,261 --> 01:14:59,894
             Where?

1573
01:14:59,896 --> 01:15:02,029
       Airport location.
         Got promoted.

1574
01:15:02,031 --> 01:15:03,865
      He's a manager now.

1575
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:05,700
     -When did this happen?
          -Yesterday.

1576
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:08,269
    Jim, I sat you on nine.

1577
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,142
   Great. Just what I needed.

1578
01:15:19,816 --> 01:15:22,884
            -Jimmy.
        -Dad. Grandpop.

1579
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:27,722
       -Have a seat, Jim.
       -I'm on the clock.

1580
01:15:30,093 --> 01:15:31,158
           Sit down.

1581
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:38,766
   I'm not gonna say a thing.
         I'm just here
      for the bad coffee.

1582
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,102
      We talked to Becky.

1583
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:43,804
            She said
    you lost the restaurant.

1584
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:46,040
            We did.

1585
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:47,975
   Well, now what's the plan?

1586
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:51,178
        I'm gonna finish
        my 1,000 hours.

1587
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,214
      They can't take that
         away from me.

1588
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,249
         You've worked
     really hard here, son.
    I'm really proud of you.

1589
01:15:55,251 --> 01:16:00,588
      We're not gonna let
  some two-faced penny pincher
      steal this from you.

1590
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:04,125
      We're gonna loan you
 the money for the restaurant.

1591
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:07,094
        You can open it
       wherever you want,
 across the street if you want.

1592
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:09,630
Drive this dive into the ground.

1593
01:16:09,632 --> 01:16:12,733
     There's one condition,
   and it is non-negotiable.

1594
01:16:15,204 --> 01:16:16,637
  You have to take some time.

1595
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,140
  For you and for your family.

1596
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:22,577
    I can't take your money.

1597
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,947
  You're not taking our money.
          It's a loan.

1598
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:27,615
       You bet your ass.

1599
01:16:27,617 --> 01:16:29,650
   And we're first dollar out
         with interest.

1600
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,289
         Look, it's not
     that I don't want it,
    or I'm not appreciative,

1601
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:37,959
    because I do, and I am.

1602
01:16:40,363 --> 01:16:44,031
   I didn't just get laid off
      from Alpha Managers.
          I got fired.

1603
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:49,136
          I got fired
   because I purposely loaded
a mortgage fund with junk bonds

1604
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:50,738
  to boost its interest rate.

1605
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:55,109
       It's not illegal,
      but it's not right,

1606
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:56,377
        and I knew that.

1607
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:00,615
   Well, what makes you think
       we're so perfect?

1608
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:03,718
     You feel bad about it?

1609
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,885
           Terrible.

1610
01:17:04,887 --> 01:17:06,821
     You gonna do it again?

1611
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:08,055
         (sighs) Never.

1612
01:17:08,057 --> 01:17:09,991
          -Well, then,
      get your head out--
             -Dad.

1613
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:14,195
 I think we'd better get busy.
  You've got a whole new life
           to create.

1614
01:17:15,765 --> 01:17:16,864
      Time to get started.

1615
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:25,272
     -Just one today, sir?
    -I'm looking for Edward.

1616
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:26,674
       Over here, Jimmy!

1617
01:17:26,676 --> 01:17:27,408
           Thank you.

1618
01:17:30,113 --> 01:17:32,079
What are you doing on the grill?

1619
01:17:32,081 --> 01:17:35,049
     I was looking forward
    to seeing you in a polo,
  throwing your weight around.

1620
01:17:35,051 --> 01:17:38,119
           (chuckles)
 Hey, that lasted about a week.

1621
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:41,222
      I couldn't stand it.

1622
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:44,324
   I figured I'd let somebody
who likes all that stiff shirts
  and paperwork have the job.

1623
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:47,094
           You know,
 the grill man has gotta grill.

1624
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:49,830
             Yeah.

1625
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:53,768
 I'm about ready to take lunch.
       You want anything?

1626
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,136
     I'm not really hungry.

1627
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:57,138
       Yeah, me neither.

1628
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,040
  How about getting a Blendie?

1629
01:17:59,042 --> 01:18:00,374
             Yeah.

1630
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:01,442
     Let's get out of here.

1631
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,084
         -That is good.
    -Better than I thought.

1632
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:14,088
   I'm opening my own Papa's.

1633
01:18:15,892 --> 01:18:17,391
        I'll be damned.

1634
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:19,193
   I want you to work for me.

1635
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:22,597
      I would love for you
      to be in management,

1636
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:25,066
        but if you're...
     hell-bent on grilling,
 then I'll take what I can get.

1637
01:18:25,068 --> 01:18:26,300
              Huh.

1638
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:28,869
              I...

1639
01:18:30,073 --> 01:18:33,107
        You know, you...
    you gotta know a man...

1640
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:36,744
       that's gonna work
        for you, Jimmy.

1641
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:38,279
          -I know you.
            -Oh, no.

1642
01:18:39,449 --> 01:18:42,116
        That's not like
       I'm talking about.

1643
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,319
        You know me now.

1644
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:47,121
  -You don't have to go into--
            -No, no.

1645
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:51,225
   I know what I need to say,
         so keep quiet
      and let me tell it.

1646
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:54,895
           (exhales)

1647
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,364
        When I was 17...

1648
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:02,369
   me and a couple other boys
       got a bad idea...

1649
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:06,373
   and we took that bad idea
       to a liquor store.

1650
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:10,044
       Now, I didn't mean
   for anyone to get hurt...

1651
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:16,283
      but I was certainly
    out to acquire something
       that wasn't mine.

1652
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,753
     Just by being there...

1653
01:19:20,957 --> 01:19:23,157
   I got tried and convicted
          as an adult.

1654
01:19:24,127 --> 01:19:28,796
      And I spent 27 years
   in a federal penitentiary.

1655
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:31,298
      Now, that's the man
    you're sitting next to.

1656
01:19:32,969 --> 01:19:33,901
           Now, I...

1657
01:19:33,903 --> 01:19:37,505
    I've had plenty of time
   to think about it, and...

1658
01:19:37,507 --> 01:19:41,342
If you really want something...

1659
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:45,012
     you gotta work for it.

1660
01:19:45,014 --> 01:19:49,049
   You know, greed doesn't...
    take you anywhere good.

1661
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:54,989
        I still want you
        to work with me.

1662
01:19:58,261 --> 01:20:00,327
         Let me ask you
       something, Jimmy.

1663
01:20:03,366 --> 01:20:06,167
          Do you love
    the restaurant business?

1664
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,870
      I see a life in it.

1665
01:20:09,872 --> 01:20:11,539
         No, that's not
       what I asked you.

1666
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:14,508
        Do you love it?

1667
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:18,879
I mean, be honest with yourself.

1668
01:20:21,951 --> 01:20:22,983
              No.

1669
01:20:27,023 --> 01:20:28,589
      No, I really don't.

1670
01:20:30,927 --> 01:20:32,326
  -You know, I love grilling.
             -Sure.

1671
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:36,330
      I'd grill for free.
   That's how much I love it.

1672
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:40,334
    What do you love so much
 that you would do it for free?

1673
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:43,037
         Because I know
 it's not slinging hash browns

1674
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:45,072
     or unplugging toilets.

1675
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:50,277
      I'm gonna tell you.
 You still need a grill man...

1676
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,113
       just let me know.

1677
01:20:53,115 --> 01:20:54,381
             -Hmm?
            -I will.

1678
01:20:55,551 --> 01:20:57,301
             Yeah.

1679
01:20:57,302 --> 01:20:59,052
     Look, it's time for me
    to roll up out of here.

1680
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:02,256
    I think we should toast.

1681
01:21:02,258 --> 01:21:04,124
Although, I'm not sure to what.

1682
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:08,095
        I can feel that.

1683
01:21:08,097 --> 01:21:09,263
        How about to...

1684
01:21:10,233 --> 01:21:11,866
       you getting fired?

1685
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,436
     All right, I'm curious
    to see where this goes.

1686
01:21:15,438 --> 01:21:18,539
      What are the chances

1687
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,641
   that you would have spent
       any time at Papa's
     if it wasn't for that?

1688
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:23,978
             -Slim.
        -How about none?

1689
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:27,281
     I'll see you, Edward.

1690
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,217
  See you around, Jimmy Mack.

1691
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:34,955
    Hey, you didn't call me
    Jimmy Dean or Jimmy Jam.

1692
01:21:36,025 --> 01:21:38,259
    No, you've been the mack
       for some time now.

1693
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:41,962
     Take care of yourself

1694
01:21:41,964 --> 01:21:43,364
          and beware.

1695
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,037
   What can I get you, Kathy?

1696
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:55,242
 I need to apologize up front.

1697
01:21:56,178 --> 01:22:00,547
      My head has been...
 a little out of sorts lately.

1698
01:22:01,517 --> 01:22:03,250
I've had days like that myself.

1699
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:06,687
        It's been worse
    the past couple of days.

1700
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:09,223
        I've been doing
     a lot of sleepwalking.

1701
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:11,158
       Millions of people
       have that problem.

1702
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:15,195
    I found a pair of jeans
  in my commode this morning.

1703
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:17,598
      Slightly concerning.

1704
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:19,667
           (exclaims)

1705
01:22:26,342 --> 01:22:28,709
   I know it's your last day.

1706
01:22:28,711 --> 01:22:30,644
  Thank you, Kathy. This is...

1707
01:22:36,585 --> 01:22:38,585
            (laughs)

1708
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:40,586
        You didn't think
         you were gonna
 get your money back, did you?

1709
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:44,391
     You know, the thought
     never crossed my mind.

1710
01:22:47,229 --> 01:22:50,531
              Jim:
    This lesson that started
   with a $200-million hustle

1711
01:22:50,533 --> 01:22:51,565
           had ended
   with a genuine $5 return.

1712
01:22:56,706 --> 01:22:59,206
     And although I decided
         against buying
       my own restaurant,

1713
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:02,276
    I found myself overcome
     with a profound sense
         of gratitude.

1714
01:23:03,245 --> 01:23:04,678
   Thanks to the 1,000 hours
           at Papa's,

1715
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,247
         I learned more
     about the true nature
        of productivity,

1716
01:23:07,249 --> 01:23:09,316
     economic organization,
         and hard work

1717
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:13,053
     than from all my time
      in business classes
 and the bond market combined.

1718
01:23:13,055 --> 01:23:15,139
     And more importantly,

1719
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:17,224
 Papa's gave me a second chance
 to get my priorities straight.

1720
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:21,528
  It's just here on the right.

1721
01:23:42,785 --> 01:23:44,785
           So, I know
     it's not what we had,

1722
01:23:44,787 --> 01:23:46,487
     but we can fix it up.

1723
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:48,589
         I think it has
      a lot of potential.

1724
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,690
        Three bedrooms,
     two and a half baths,
    so there's room to grow.

1725
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:01,602
         It's perfect.

1726
01:24:01,604 --> 01:24:03,170
             -Yeah?
            -Mm-hmm.

1727
01:24:08,277 --> 01:24:09,576
              Jim:
    It's always troubled me

1728
01:24:09,578 --> 01:24:11,578
  that those who cannot afford
       financial services

1729
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,614
      are usually the ones
       who need it most.

1730
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:15,416
              So,
 at Adams Financial Management,

1731
01:24:15,418 --> 01:24:17,518
           we decided
     to make it a priority.

1732
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,553
       Beyond rekindling
      my fire for finance,

1733
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:22,289
        it's allowed me
        to keep in touch
   with people I care about.

1734
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:25,726
 Jacqui and her husband, Derek,
      saved enough to get
   their daughter to college.

1735
01:24:26,762 --> 01:24:29,263
  Mary and Billy got divorced,
        then remarried,

1736
01:24:29,265 --> 01:24:30,881
   then got another divorce,

1737
01:24:30,882 --> 01:24:32,498
        but are planning
     to get remarried again
         in the spring.

1738
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:37,104
     Manuel and his family
        decided to start
     their own restaurant.

1739
01:24:37,106 --> 01:24:40,507
   I was hired as an advisor,
  but what they really needed
         was a referee.

1740
01:24:43,112 --> 01:24:46,080
  Edward still works the grill
 over at the airport location.

1741
01:24:48,284 --> 01:24:51,385
      And two days a week,
        we work the bags
       over at Anthony's.

1742
01:24:53,389 --> 01:24:55,289
       Get it out, Jimmy.

1743
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:03,163
     -Jim: Getting better.
         -Edward: Yeah.

1744
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:04,631
   -Jim: I'm coming for you.
      -Edward: You got it.

1745
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:06,533
            Edward:
      Let's see it, okay.

1746
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:11,238
            Edward:
      Yeah, give it to me.

1747
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:14,508
            Edward:
        Get it all out.

1748
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:20,414
            Edward:
 You got it, baby. You got it.
You're smoking, Jimmy. Smoking.

1749
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,221
          ¶ Your lap ¶

1750
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:28,622
          ¶ Your lap ¶

1751
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:32,159
          ¶ Your lap ¶

1752
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:41,235
       ¶ You were so good
   But you've taken a turn ¶

1753
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:51,211
   ¶ You wanted the knowledge
    that you couldn't earn ¶

1754
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:58,519
     ¶ So carry the weight
     of the guilt you own ¶

1755
01:25:58,521 --> 01:26:03,657
 ¶ The secrets, they follow us
      from home to home ¶

1756
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:09,596
       ¶ All these walls
   But you found the crack ¶

1757
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:14,868
       ¶ Like waterfall,
    You ain't coming back ¶

1758
01:26:16,305 --> 01:26:20,807
      ¶ Like ice in rocks
  You look right on through ¶

1759
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:26,180
        ¶ Exposed a love
      that I never knew ¶

1760
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:28,382
             ¶ Oh ¶

1761
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,687
             ¶ Oh ¶

1762
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:39,293
             ¶ Oh ¶

1763
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:44,264
             ¶ Oh ¶

1764
01:26:50,773 --> 01:26:53,607
      (blues song playing)

1765
01:27:15,698 --> 01:27:17,898
    ¶ Mama's in the grave ¶

1766
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:21,368
        ¶ Well, her soul
      has gone to heaven ¶

1767
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:24,705
 ¶ And my daddy's on his way ¶

1768
01:27:24,707 --> 01:27:27,574
          ¶ And that's
      a hard road to hoe ¶

1769
01:27:29,278 --> 01:27:31,612
  ¶ You gave me this guitar ¶

1770
01:27:31,614 --> 01:27:34,881
           ¶ And now,
   I'm learning how to play ¶

1771
01:27:34,883 --> 01:27:38,418
    ¶ Yeah, I have to start
           to sing ¶

1772
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:41,622
   ¶ I got a long way to go ¶

1773
01:27:46,795 --> 01:27:49,696
    ¶ It's a long, long road
            I know ¶

1774
01:28:00,309 --> 01:28:03,343
     ¶ A hard road to hoe ¶

1775
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:17,324
 ¶ Papa taught me by the belt ¶

1776
01:28:17,326 --> 01:28:20,527
          ¶ And though
   I earned every whopping ¶

1777
01:28:20,529 --> 01:28:23,730
   ¶ Yeah, I've had my share
           of welts ¶

1778
01:28:23,732 --> 01:28:27,367
      ¶ Still I turned out
       better than most ¶

1779
01:28:27,369 --> 01:28:30,604
        ¶ Well, the lord
  won't solve your problems ¶

1780
01:28:30,606 --> 01:28:33,607
    ¶ But he might show you
          the answer ¶

1781
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:36,677
     ¶ You're too stubborn
        to understand ¶

1782
01:28:36,679 --> 01:28:39,780
       ¶ You just keep on
        begging please ¶

1783
01:28:44,887 --> 01:28:47,888
¶ Yeah, you keep on begging me ¶

1784
01:28:57,733 --> 01:29:00,701
         ¶ You keep on
      begging me please ¶

1785
01:29:38,574 --> 01:29:40,874
    ¶ Mama's in the grave ¶

1786
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:44,444
        ¶ Well, her soul
      has gone to heaven ¶

1787
01:29:44,446 --> 01:29:47,481
 ¶ And my daddy's on his way ¶

1788
01:29:47,483 --> 01:29:50,584
          ¶ And that's
      a hard road to hoe ¶
