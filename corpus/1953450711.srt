1
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:42,787
Cody!

2
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:46,258
Just the man I wanted to see.

3
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:49,560
Zack. Just the man I want
to see walking away.

4
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,931
Now, normally I'd be insulted by that,

5
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,271
But I need to talk to you,

6
00:02:55,332 --> 00:02:57,372
So I'll return just the insult later.

7
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:59,441
But just know, it's gonna
be about that shirt.

8
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:01,212
Look, Zack, now's not a good time.

9
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:03,743
You still haven't told
Bailey yet, have you?

10
00:03:03,812 --> 00:03:05,082
Why are you so scared to tell Bailey.

11
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,984
You're doing an internship
over spring break?

12
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,226
Because, you know, we've made
special plans for the week,

13
00:03:10,285 --> 00:03:13,156
And this is also the last spring
break before our graduation.

14
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,395
And because she can take you.

15
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:15,696
She cannot take me.

16
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:17,266
She put you in a headlock with her thumb.

17
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:18,867
You blacked out.
You missed November.

18
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:20,638
They had to re-inflate your
lungs with a bicycle pump.

19
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:23,309
Okay, maybe she can take me.

20
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:26,008
Which is why I wrote
everything in this letter.

21
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,779
She'll understand when she reads it,

22
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:29,339
And I'll be nowhere near when she does.

23
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,409
Cody, I've got good news.

24
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,479
You're a hologram and I'm an only child?

25
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:36,821
Better. I think I can help you
with this pesky Bailey situation.

26
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:40,362
Then think again, unless the
first time exhausted you.

27
00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:41,763
Good one.

28
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:44,693
Sorry.
Out!

29
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:46,464
Come on.

30
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:52,805
Okay, so, here's my proposal.

31
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,605
Let me break the news to Bailey,

32
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:57,317
Therefore, giving her time to break
other things rather than your bones,

33
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,887
And in return, you give me the car.

34
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:01,417
What car?

35
00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:03,518
Dad's vintage sports car,
that he and mom promised you.

36
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:05,518
For getting into college.

37
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:08,289
Which is a big building where
people go to learn things.

38
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:09,898
Oh, well, then, maybe they can teach you.

39
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,060
How to get along without a
car, because I want it.

40
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,871
Why? The only place you go more
than once a day is the bathroom.

41
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:18,702
And how much nicer
would it be to drive there?

42
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:20,712
I call shotgun!
Forget it.

43
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:23,743
The car is mine, and I certainly
don't need your help with Bailey.

44
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:25,443
No, you need me.

45
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:27,483
Zack, give that back. Zack!
Hey, come on, let that go!

46
00:04:27,553 --> 00:04:31,025
Careful with that, Zack.
Give me that. No! No!

47
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:33,756
First, it's special delivery.

48
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:36,666
And now, it's air mail.

49
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:39,426
Guess you're gonna have
to write another letter.

50
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:42,467
That took me 14 hours to compose.

51
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:44,437
Why is it whenever something
is important to me,

52
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:46,207
You always find a way to ruin it?

53
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:48,378
It's fun...

54
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:51,250
Oh. Now, I have to
explain to Bailey.

55
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:54,720
Something I was able to write
so eloquently in sanskrit.

56
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,620
Go away, Zack.

57
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,922
I don't want you standing anywhere
near here when I talk to Bailey.

58
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:01,161
When you say, "near here..."

59
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:05,333
Everywhere!

60
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:08,634
Wow, wow!

61
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:10,704
Try and help out your brother
for no other reason.

62
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:13,505
Than to get something from him,
and this is the thanks you get?

63
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:16,506
Come, woodster, we're leaving.

64
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:17,845
You know, between moseby and Cody,

65
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:19,747
We're not really not welcome
anywhere on this ship.

66
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:21,116
Which is weird because we're adorable.

67
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,748
I know, right?
Quite.

68
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,554
So, then the neutron asked, "hey, waiter,

69
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:54,895
"how much is the soda?
" and the waiter responded with,

70
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:56,355
"for you, no charge!"

71
00:05:56,425 --> 00:06:00,538
oh, this day is perfect.

72
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,867
Yes, it is. So far.

73
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:04,807
Okay, so let's talk about spring break.

74
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:07,877
I am so excited.
I've been planning our trip for a month.

75
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:10,248
Yeah, well, that's not very thorough.

76
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:12,009
Can you believe we're finally going to see.

77
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,380
The majestic ancient redwoods?

78
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,621
Oh, uh, did you know that
over 7,000 species.

79
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:21,292
Of lethal insects make
colonies in aged wood?

80
00:06:21,362 --> 00:06:23,323
Duh! Okay, and then,
we're going to watch.

81
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:25,093
The Northwestern lemming run,

82
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:27,634
Where lemmings instinctively
hurl their furry little bodies.

83
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:29,903
Right off of those picturesque cliffs.

84
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:34,375
Well, nothing says spring break
like dodging falling rodents.

85
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:36,206
Okay. What is going on?

86
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:39,516
I've been trying to
tell you this whole time...

87
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:42,246
Cody, just the man I wanted to see...

88
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:43,687
Zack!

89
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:46,958
Look, this is only gonna take a
sec, and I wanna tell you...

90
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:50,530
Woody, Woody...
Down. Like I showed you.

91
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,400
I'm not good with machinery that moves.

92
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,770
I once fell down an
escalator for over an hour!

93
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,741
Easy, Woody, easy.

94
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,240
Zack, what are you doing here?

95
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,242
You said not to "stand" anywhere
near you while you talk to Bailey.

96
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:06,144
But I'm not standing.
I'm swinging.

97
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,514
Is this about that car?

98
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:11,954
Yes. Mom and dad
promised it to you,

99
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:13,955
So they won't let me have it
unless you say it's okay.

100
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:16,765
Zack, I'm talking to Bailey right now.
I would really prefer...

101
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:19,126
You haven't told her yet?

102
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:23,707
Bailey, Cody is going to do an internship
at a biology reserve over spring break.

103
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,838
Excuse me?

104
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:26,979
Cody is what?

105
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:28,208
Guess not.

106
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:29,978
Wait, our last spring break together,

107
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:32,309
And you choose some
biology reserve over me?

108
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:35,920
No, Bailey... Okay, yes.

109
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,520
I've been trying to tell
you, but I couldn't.

110
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,962
Look, I wrote it all down in a
letter explaining everything,

111
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:42,523
But Zack lost it.

112
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,933
A letter?
You put this in a letter?

113
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:46,063
Can you believe that?

114
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:49,503
You let me go on and on, talking about.

115
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:51,204
How much this spring break meant to me,

116
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:53,034
When the whole time, you made other plans.

117
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:54,145
I know.

118
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:57,115
One word. Inconsiderate.

119
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,315
Or is that two words?

120
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,916
I can't even look at you right now.

121
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:01,086
No, it's one word.

122
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,417
What just happened?

123
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:08,058
Well, for starters, you should
have explained to Bailey.

124
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:09,988
That the only reason
you're doing the internship.

125
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:11,298
Is because you want to get
a scholarship to Yale?

126
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,600
That's what was in the letter!

127
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,030
Why did you drop it then?

128
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,041
Snacks.
Thanks.

129
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:21,172
Hey, Woody. Catch!

130
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:22,311
Not very nice.

131
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:23,511
Ooh! Sandwich!

132
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:24,642
Whoa!

133
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:27,912
Sorry.

134
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:44,636
This facility is breathtaking.

135
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:46,767
I literally can't breathe.

136
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:49,339
Oh, my. What an
incredible opportunity.

137
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:51,780
I'll say. Having one of you
gone over spring break.

138
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,050
Means half the possibility of disaster.

139
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,220
Something I've been longing for
since the dawn of time itself.

140
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,650
You were in your teens then, right?

141
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,161
Zack.

142
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:03,661
What are you doing here?
And by here, I mean earth!

143
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:06,433
London brought me.

144
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:07,933
And I thought I'd give you another chance.

145
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:09,363
To reconsider the whole car thing.

146
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,375
Oh, forget it.

147
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,534
Bailey is still not talking to me.

148
00:09:13,604 --> 00:09:14,804
Can you blame her?

149
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:16,545
No, I can blame you!

150
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:22,017
Wouldn't they look cute in a hat?

151
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:23,317
Or ks a hat?

152
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:25,087
I just love fishies.

153
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:27,988
Actually, London, they're not fish.
They're mammals.

154
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:29,829
But they don't have humps.

155
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:33,199
Not camels. Mammals.
As in they breathe air.

156
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,130
Fishies do not breathe "air,"
that's why they live in the water.

157
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,870
They're not fishies.
They're mammals.

158
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,271
Then why don't they have humps?

159
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:44,642
Ooh, yummy!
A fruit plate.

160
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:45,912
They must have known I was coming.

161
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:53,694
Mmm. Ooh!
This is so delicious.

162
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:55,254
Uh, uh... London...

163
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,237
Ugh! (Squeals)

164
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:07,508
I ate fish food!
I ate fish food!

165
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:10,678
Actually, it's mammal food.

166
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,149
Then why don't they have humps?

167
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,821
Zack, please go away before
you mess this up for me, too.

168
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:22,291
Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's
like you don't trust me.

169
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:24,232
It's not like that.
It is that.

170
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,662
Cody? Cody Martin.

171
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:29,933
Welcome. Donald spaulding,
renowned scientist.

172
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:31,734
It says so on my parking spot.

173
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:35,144
I know. I saw.
I gushed.

174
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:38,175
Sir, I can't tell you how excited
I am about this internship.

175
00:10:38,244 --> 00:10:40,546
As we are excited to have you.

176
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:43,347
Oh, society of super scientists!

177
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,357
Since I was your age.

178
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,588
Test tube, beaker, isotope!

179
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:50,328
You can't be us and be a dope!

180
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:53,529
Go, scientists!
Go, scientists!

181
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,200
So lame!

182
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,611
This is my brother, Zack.

183
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:04,381
I got the all the brains, and he got...

184
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:07,353
Hey, how you doin'?

185
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:08,553
Hey, you're ugly.

186
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:12,185
Well, nothing, really.

187
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,754
Mmm.

188
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:15,824
Well, follow me, and I'll
show you to the lab.

189
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:19,696
Oh, kill me now.

190
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,837
I designed this entire facility myself,

191
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:24,967
So, it's completely state
of the art and wicked cool!

192
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:28,338
Well, that looks promising.

193
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:53,503
Come on in.
All are welcome. Perfect.

194
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:09,128
Hello, there.
I'm Zack Martin.

195
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:13,599
You know, I'm having trouble trying to
decide who is cuter, you or the dolphin.

196
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:14,870
I'm Nellie.

197
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,940
Nellie... Nellie, so,
what do you do around here.

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,571
Besides, you know, look amazing?

199
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:26,082
I'm a lab tech. Your brother Cody
is doing an internship here, right?

200
00:12:26,152 --> 00:12:27,652
Are you as smart as he is?

201
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:31,354
Smarter. You know, I recently
posted the highest score ever.

202
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:32,754
On kangaroo kaboom.

203
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:36,755
So, can you operate that?

204
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:43,196
Oh! Let's find out!

205
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:50,609
Cody, out of 2,000 applicants,

206
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:52,678
Your paper was the most intriguing.

207
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:55,719
I almost sent a duplicate in
latin, to show diversity.

208
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:58,550
I should have.
I never listen to that voice in my head.

209
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,350
Mostly because it's in latin.

210
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,692
Well. A brilliant essay.
"theories of communicating with another species,

211
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:07,403
"or what it's like
to have a twin brother."

212
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:10,333
The culmination of a lifetime
of unwilling research.

213
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:13,874
I know just how you feel.
I have a lesser twin myself.

214
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:17,314
I think you'll be inspired by
the research we're working on.

215
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:19,874
I'm just inspired that you iron your tie.

216
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:22,346
Oh! Me, too!
I iron my pocket hankie.

217
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,286
No one cares.
Okay.

218
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:27,117
Sir, I can't wait to see what
other wonders will unfold.

219
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:28,888
Well, I've discovered a rare fruit,

220
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,998
That, when combined with the
DNA of these jellyfish,

221
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:35,529
Could enable dolphins to
telepathically communicate with us,

222
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,639
Making our two worlds one.

223
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:38,740
Do you know what this means?

224
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,001
That we can talk to dolphins.

225
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:41,311
I'm sorry, was that not clear?

226
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,041
It was clear.
Just very strange.

227
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:46,613
No, it isn't.
This could change the world!

228
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:50,082
Just imagine it, Cody.
By feeding dolphins this substance,

229
00:13:50,152 --> 00:13:53,453
We could potentially teach them
about humanity and science,

230
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:55,454
And they could teach us about...

231
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:01,265
Follow me.

232
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:05,337
Zack.

233
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:08,037
This is so exciting!
I have so many questions!

234
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:10,108
As would Zack, if he were here!

235
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:11,177
Not here?

236
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:14,620
Zack's not here.

237
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,949
No, he is not!

238
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,920
So, why don't I take a casual,
nonchalant little stroll.

239
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,391
To see if I can locate
the harmless little lad.

240
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,460
I'll just be right...

241
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,061
Here they are.

242
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:31,433
Obviously, we use dolphins because
they are incredibly intelligent.

243
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:37,574
Except Wally.

244
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,986
The closer the research
comes to its conclusion,

245
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:44,186
The more I know that they
want it as much as we do.

246
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:45,956
And exactly how close are you?

247
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,987
Just really good friends.
Why? What have you heard?

248
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:51,959
I meant, with the research.

249
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,099
I know. I mean, I knew
that was what you were...

250
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:00,170
There are a series of steps to
converging our minds with dolphins.

251
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,710
But I know you'll be a vital
part of our work here.

252
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,342
Sir, I'm honored that you've
put such trust in me.

253
00:15:06,412 --> 00:15:07,952
Just one thing.
Yes?

254
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:10,153
Can I have a name tag?

255
00:15:11,122 --> 00:15:12,683
How's that? (Chuckles)

256
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:14,793
Here you go.

257
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:16,224
And it's laminated!

258
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:17,893
Did it myself.

259
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:22,967
These are the most technically
advanced submersibles in the world.

260
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:25,437
Why don't you get in and get a feel for it?

261
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:35,249
Zack Martin, get out of there this second!

262
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,990
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna do anything, uh...

263
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,760
Like that?

264
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:42,121
What did you do?

265
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,592
I don't know.
I just pressed this thing-a-majig.

266
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:46,331
And played with this
hoozie-ma-whats,

267
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:50,873
And flipped the lever
that said "start."

268
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,332
That explains it.

269
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:55,705
I insist you cease and desist.

270
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:57,944
Okay, fine.
I can unpress th all.

271
00:15:58,014 --> 00:15:59,515
Don't unpress. Press was bad.

272
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,185
Unpress, even worse than press.

273
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:02,715
Well, I guess we could find out.

274
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:17,070
So, it's my understanding
that you graduated from Yale.

275
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,500
With top honors.

276
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,340
I know.

277
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,641
How? I did a little
research of my own.

278
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:27,581
Well, now, Yale is begging
me for my research.

279
00:16:29,482 --> 00:16:30,483
Uh-huh.

280
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:33,583
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

281
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:37,094
Well, and Harvard, and Princeton,

282
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,965
And quite a few community colleges.

283
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:46,537
And one vocational school.

284
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,437
As well they should.

285
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:51,308
Well, you know, not to brag,

286
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,619
But do you know what the
other researchers call me?

287
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:55,849
Idiot!

288
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:00,049
No. Well, not to my face.

289
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,221
Not you, sir. Him!

290
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,391
Oh, no!

291
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,132
Zack! Get out of there!
Can you hear me?

292
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:17,074
Oh, Cody!
What are you doing?

293
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:28,557
<i>What are you doing?</i>

294
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:30,827
<i>Turn around
and go back now!</i>

295
00:17:30,897 --> 00:17:33,158
<i>Sure, that would be
the not fun option.</i>

296
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:35,567
<i>Zack!</i>

297
00:17:35,628 --> 00:17:37,540
<i>That's
sea Captain Zack to you.</i>

298
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,939
<i>Whoa!</i>

299
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,910
<i>Turn around!</i>

300
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:48,351
Do something!
Stop them!

301
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:49,681
<i>You don't know
what you're doing!</i>

302
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,182
<i>You don't know
what you're doing!</i>

303
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:53,222
Sea wall!
Of course I see the wall.

304
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:54,524
It's a big glass wall.

305
00:17:56,694 --> 00:17:57,994
You're heading towards the sea wall!

306
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:05,706
If that sea wall goes,
you'll be sucked out to sea!

307
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:06,766
<i>Eject!</i>

308
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,106
<i>No, you're a reject!</i>

309
00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:10,537
<i>Not reject,
you, reject! Eject!</i>

310
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:12,308
<i>Wall!</i>

311
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:15,548
Eject! Eject!

312
00:18:15,618 --> 00:18:17,349
<i>Eject now! The red button!</i>

313
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,902
Okay...

314
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:31,233
Some of you may look at
this tank as half empty,

315
00:18:31,303 --> 00:18:32,873
But it's more like a quarter.

316
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:34,773
Dr. Spaulding,
I can explain.

317
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,086
Is that a dolphin?

318
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:48,426
Fired! Fired from
my internship.

319
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:50,387
There goes my scholarship to Yale.

320
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:51,698
And my girlfriend won't even talk to me!

321
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,468
It's all your fault, Zack!

322
00:18:54,528 --> 00:18:57,269
Hey, hey, hey, I totally
understand that you feel the need.

323
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,769
To put the blame on anyone
who happens to be nearby.

324
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:02,669
That was my one shot, Zack.

325
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,411
Look, it looks bad now.

326
00:19:05,481 --> 00:19:08,912
But we're going to look
back at this and laugh.

327
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:13,083
And remember, "he who laughs
last, thinks the slowest."

328
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,553
This wasn't like all the
other times you messed up.

329
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,824
This affects my whole my future.

330
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:19,995
That's unforgivable.

331
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:21,365
Hey, I didn't mean to.

332
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:24,336
You never mean to do it,
Zack. You just do it!

333
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,037
I'll never forgive you
for this! Ever!

334
00:19:29,277 --> 00:19:30,236
I hate you!

335
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,476
That's harsh.

336
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:38,849
I'm done, man.
We're through.

337
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,320
We may be twins, but we are not brothers.

338
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,944
Did I do a good job, sir?

339
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:09,247
Cody and I were supposed to
spend spring break together,

340
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:11,747
And he went off to do
something at just he wanted.

341
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:13,188
Oh, that is sad.

342
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:15,818
You want to count my money?

343
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:18,188
You can't have it, but you can count it.

344
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,829
Oh.

345
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,200
Ha! It's Cody. Again!

346
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:24,360
So, answer him.

347
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,031
Are you kidding?
And let him off that easy?

348
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,301
No, think again.

349
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:29,002
Okay, I'll try.

350
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:33,273
You know, Cody hurt me.

351
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:34,873
He abandoned me.

352
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,983
And now, he needs to know what
it feels like to be ignored.

353
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:40,254
I'm sorry, what?

354
00:20:40,314 --> 00:20:43,225
Cody won't hear from me
until he's so worried.

355
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,627
He's trembling like a hound
dog pushing out a peach pit.

356
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:49,126
Ha! I am woman,
hear me ignore!

357
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:50,196
I'm sorry, what?

358
00:20:57,808 --> 00:21:00,109
Oh, thanks!
They're Arturo vitali.

359
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,540
They're made from eel skin.

360
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,711
I hope they're not anybody you know.

361
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:17,063
Cody, there you are.

362
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,763
Go away!

363
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:22,176
Didn't you get my e-mail about me
constructing my emotional borders.

364
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:25,206
Forbidding you from entering
the country that is my soul?

365
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:27,405
All your e-mails go
directly to trash.

366
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:30,246
Besides, I think you're gonna cheer
up once you see who I've found.

367
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:34,247
Good day,
Mr. Martin.

368
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:35,487
Dr. Spaulding?
Yes.

369
00:21:35,557 --> 00:21:37,689
What are you doing here?

370
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,190
Well, although there is no chance
you'll ever work for me again, ever,

371
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,330
In this, or in any parallel universe,

372
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,870
There is another internship.

373
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,230
That I think you're right for.

374
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:51,941
Are you serious? Don't toy with me now.
I'm fragile and broken.

375
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,713
No, I'm quite serious.

376
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,413
It would be a shame to see
your talents go to waste.

377
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,414
Sir, you don't know
how much this means to me,

378
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,884
Just getting a second chance.

379
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:03,054
Well, the gemini project,
about 50 miles from us,

380
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:04,685
Is an isolated science camp.

381
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:08,496
Doing research similar
to ours, but on twins.

382
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:10,997
I'm a twin!
The superior twin. Yes.

383
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:12,868
It's true.
I'm proof.

384
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:15,098
You certainly are.

385
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:18,038
Well, I sent your application paper.

386
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:20,879
To the scientist
who runs it, Dr. Olsen.

387
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:22,779
He was quite excited.

388
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:23,980
There's just one thing.

389
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,449
Anything.
I'll do anything.

390
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,092
Well, because the work Dr.
Olsen is doing is on twins,

391
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:32,261
You and your brother would need to attend.

392
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:34,423
Just not that thing.

393
00:22:36,393 --> 00:22:39,164
That is Dr. Olsen's
one requirement.

394
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:43,034
After reading your paper, he thinks
that you could be the ideal twins.

395
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:44,604
To participate in his research.

396
00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:48,046
Me and Zack? In a lab?

397
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,147
Hey, it's not like I'm just some idiot.

398
00:22:50,216 --> 00:22:51,776
Who doesn't know anything about science.

399
00:22:51,846 --> 00:22:53,746
Oh, yeah? What's matter?

400
00:22:53,817 --> 00:22:55,557
Nothing.
What's the matter with you?

401
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:57,118
See? See?

402
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:58,988
I can't go anywhere with him.

403
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:01,158
Yeah? Well, I don't wanna
go anywhere with you first!

404
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:02,760
And when I get there, you're not welcome!

405
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:04,630
Ouch.

406
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,401
Well, that is a shame.

407
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:15,242
You know, this internship
could help you qualify.

408
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:16,942
For a scholarship to Yale.

409
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:18,413
It would?

410
00:23:18,483 --> 00:23:23,085
Cody, are you really going to let
your anger towards your brother.

411
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:24,926
Jeopardize your entire future?

412
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:53,222
Is this your lunch?

413
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:55,392
Oh, it was.

414
00:23:55,462 --> 00:23:56,894
Cody, next time you throw up,

415
00:23:56,964 --> 00:23:59,103
At least tell me so I can grab my camera.

416
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:02,004
Oh, I love you, dock.

417
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,105
Oh. Mmm.

418
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:07,374
You must be the Martin
twins, Zack and Cody.

419
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:11,577
Oh, hi. I'm Cody.

420
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:13,217
It's an honor
to meet you, Dr. Olsen.

421
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,987
I know. Come on, I have
so much to show you.

422
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:17,359
Come on, don't dawdle.

423
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:21,759
Come on.

424
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,029
Let me help you with that.

425
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,801
Oh, it's really heavy.
Watch out.

426
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,771
Yeah. This way.

427
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:37,383
I think you're both gonna see that
this is someplace very special.

428
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:40,653
I'll say.

429
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:42,584
This facility is fantastic.

430
00:24:42,654 --> 00:24:44,825
This was actually
an abandoned mill complex.

431
00:24:44,895 --> 00:24:47,326
The actual sawmill is on the
other side of the Lake.

432
00:24:47,396 --> 00:24:48,865
We're planning on renovating it.

433
00:24:48,927 --> 00:24:50,926
I have two words for you
that might change your life.

434
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:52,336
Hot. Tub.

435
00:24:52,396 --> 00:24:55,037
There you go.
My contribution to science.

436
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:58,778
Now, I must warn you.
My brother's idea of research.

437
00:24:58,838 --> 00:25:01,608
Is discovering how to
simultaneously burp and sneeze.

438
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,910
I can almost do it without
my eyes popping out.

439
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,720
You must be very proud.

440
00:25:12,822 --> 00:25:15,262
Welcome to the most advanced.

441
00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:19,563
Subterranean neuroscientific
laboratory on earth.

442
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:23,404
Gentlemen, I give you the gemini project.

443
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:25,505
It kind of just looks
like a giant basement.

444
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:26,845
So, you don't think it's too much?

445
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:29,176
Well, it doesn't
really scream "science."

446
00:25:29,246 --> 00:25:30,446
'cause I decorated it myself.

447
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:33,516
Is that the hydro-isotope
caloubometer,

448
00:25:33,586 --> 00:25:37,788
Capable of reading the
undetectable electrical charges.

449
00:25:37,858 --> 00:25:39,288
In a miniscule brain wave?

450
00:25:39,358 --> 00:25:40,859
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?

451
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:42,829
Oh, I love her.

452
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:45,469
Oh. Shh.

453
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:48,070
Baby, don't speak.

454
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,801
Cody, come, come, this way.
I have to show you this.

455
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:56,583
This is my mind transference facilitator.

456
00:25:56,643 --> 00:26:00,014
Every apparatus in this
shangri-la of science...

457
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:01,314
It's astounding.

458
00:26:01,383 --> 00:26:02,454
What's this?

459
00:26:02,524 --> 00:26:04,155
Uh, that's a cappuccino machine.

460
00:26:04,224 --> 00:26:05,494
Dibs on this.

461
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,495
And dibs on these.

462
00:26:09,565 --> 00:26:10,967
Hey, hey, Nellie.

463
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:13,997
Nellie. I'm Zack.
Remember me?

464
00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:16,208
I crashed that trillion dollar sub.

465
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:18,338
Kind of a legend in the science world.

466
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:20,909
Hello, Zack.
This is my sister, kellie.

467
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:24,149
We sometimes help Dr.
Spaulding with his work as well.

468
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,450
Since the research is so similar.

469
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,922
So, what exactly are you working on?

470
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:35,062
My colleague,
Dr. Spaulding,

471
00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:37,292
Is developing a substance
that will allow dolphins.

472
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:40,433
To communicate with humans telepathically.

473
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:42,504
It's Noble, sure, it's Noble,

474
00:26:42,574 --> 00:26:46,876
But my goal is to use it to perfect
communication between humans.

475
00:26:46,946 --> 00:26:48,746
For what result?

476
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,116
Imagine. If we could connect
with each other's minds,

477
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,047
We'd actually be able to
feel what others feel.

478
00:26:54,117 --> 00:26:58,317
And where there's more empathy between
people, there's less conflict.

479
00:26:58,387 --> 00:27:00,757
So you chose Zack and me.

480
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,760
Because we have conflict?

481
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,330
Exactly! Now, initially
my research was on twins.

482
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:06,770
Because of your similar DNA,

483
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,940
But it's progressed far beyond that.

484
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,711
If I can resolve the irresolvable conflicts.

485
00:27:12,771 --> 00:27:14,872
Between twins such as yourselves,

486
00:27:14,942 --> 00:27:18,012
I can expand that to all mankind,

487
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:22,625
And create a world free of fighting,
and anger, and aggression.

488
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,784
Well, that'll make hockey fun.

489
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:27,455
Perhaps it will be better if I show you.

490
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:29,996
So, why am I wired up to this thing again?

491
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:33,667
I need to establish a baseline
for your brain processing speed.

492
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:37,508
Why even bother?
He's asked that question three times.

493
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:42,808
Now, Zack, words will flash on the
screen in a series of colors.

494
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:48,850
Red, green, blue... But the color of the
letters won't correspond to the word.

495
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,320
For example, the word
"blue" is written in red.

496
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:52,922
Can this thing kill asteroids?

497
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:54,163
No.

498
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:55,422
Kind of a waste of money then.

499
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:57,392
You see what I have to live with?

500
00:27:57,462 --> 00:28:00,764
Zack, your job is to
correctly touch the color.

501
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:02,974
The word is spelling in the allotted time.

502
00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:05,845
Got it!
Really?

503
00:28:05,904 --> 00:28:07,305
No. No.
No?

504
00:28:10,676 --> 00:28:11,746
Did you get all the brains?

505
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,816
Yeah. Pretty much.

506
00:28:14,187 --> 00:28:15,957
Ow!

507
00:28:16,017 --> 00:28:18,018
Keep in mind that if you
don't respond fast enough,

508
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:20,058
The machine administers a small shock.

509
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:21,888
Okay. Wait, what?

510
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:25,299
Cody, you register reply times.

511
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:26,598
Mmm-hmm.

512
00:28:26,668 --> 00:28:27,900
This is going to be fun.

513
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,470
So, uh...

514
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,012
Okay.

515
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:35,572
Huh.

516
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:40,652
What do I win?
Mom and dad's car?

517
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:47,625
Ow! Ooh, that hurt.

518
00:28:47,695 --> 00:28:50,126
Concentrate.
Next one's up.

519
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,896
Hey, that's not fair, I was talking.

520
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:55,396
Yeah, that's usually
where your troubles begin.

521
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:02,549
Ow. I felt that one
in my toes.

522
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,449
Ow! Ow!

523
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,719
Ow!

524
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,820
Get them right
and there won't be a problem.

525
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:17,592
How can I... How can I get them
right if they're moving too fast?

526
00:29:20,263 --> 00:29:22,574
Oh, very disappointing results...

527
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:26,674
Hey, take your revenge now.

528
00:29:26,744 --> 00:29:28,444
As long as this makes us...
Ow! ...Even.

529
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:35,288
Let's get one thing straight.
We will never be even.

530
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,299
You know, right about now,

531
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,341
Cody and I would be romantically
feasting on edible fungi.

532
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,171
We picked off the organically
fertilized forest floor.

533
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:56,142
Wow.
You're a cheap date.

534
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,783
But none of that matters now.

535
00:29:57,842 --> 00:29:59,913
Yeah, because Cody made his choice,

536
00:29:59,983 --> 00:30:02,113
And he chose science over chemistry.

537
00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:04,454
Did it ever occur to you that he
might have had a very good reason...

538
00:30:04,524 --> 00:30:05,893
You know what?
Not good enough.

539
00:30:05,953 --> 00:30:06,924
But if you two could just communicate...

540
00:30:06,994 --> 00:30:08,055
You know what, after this moment,

541
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,366
I'm done talking about Cody.

542
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:10,496
Works for me.

543
00:30:10,566 --> 00:30:12,166
I am in.
Great.

544
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:15,936
Aw, look at the cute crabs.

545
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:18,937
Oh, that one looks just
like my Uncle carmine.

546
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:21,108
He had those same beady red eyes,

547
00:30:21,178 --> 00:30:23,948
And claw-like hands,
and scaly complexion.

548
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:25,379
Oh.

549
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,579
It's okay, it's okay.

550
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:28,020
He met a woman who looks
just like a lobster.

551
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,490
Now, they're really happy together.

552
00:30:29,551 --> 00:30:32,150
No. Cody loves crabs.

553
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,020
Especially, that little bib you
get to wear when you eat them.

554
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,332
He calls it his
"crustacean catcher."

555
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,332
You two are a barnyard full of crazy.

556
00:30:41,803 --> 00:30:43,072
Okay, good luck!

557
00:30:44,004 --> 00:30:45,074
Good luck with what?

558
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:50,116
Fine. Keep your claws on.
I won't tell them.

559
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:51,215
Tell us what?

560
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:52,376
About the escape.

561
00:30:52,446 --> 00:30:53,716
Escape? What escape?

562
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:56,586
If I told you I wouldn't
"not be telling you!" hello!

563
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,158
Sorry, boys.
You're about to be lunch.

564
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,469
We got a runner!
We got a runner!

565
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:08,030
Sit!

566
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,870
Boo, you, little crabby!
Boo, you!

567
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
Help.

568
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:25,084
Salt?

569
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:26,393
Thank you.

570
00:31:28,394 --> 00:31:30,595
More water?
Read my mind!

571
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:36,706
Napkin?

572
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:37,837
Oh, absolutely!

573
00:31:39,637 --> 00:31:43,008
You guys are all so nice to each other.

574
00:31:43,078 --> 00:31:45,779
Why wouldn't we be?
That's what I was going to say!

575
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:49,649
Twins should always be nice to each other,

576
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:51,050
Don't you agree, Ben and sven?

577
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,491
Yeah.
Yeah.

578
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:56,632
We love being twins.
Don't you?

579
00:31:56,692 --> 00:32:01,062
Well, if by love you mean
a dark bottomless pit.

580
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:06,574
Of constant burning of a thousand
white hot suns, then yes.

581
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:08,674
So, you two don't get along?

582
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:11,875
Sure. We got a long...
List of things that.

583
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:13,786
We can't stand about each other.

584
00:32:13,846 --> 00:32:16,316
Well, you know, how can I
get along with someone.

585
00:32:16,387 --> 00:32:18,587
Who's constantly ruining my life?

586
00:32:18,656 --> 00:32:22,028
Or someone who is constantly
telling you what's wrong?

587
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:23,858
Well, everything you do is wrong!

588
00:32:23,928 --> 00:32:25,729
Oh, like coming here to help you?

589
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,500
Oh, please.
You only did that.

590
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,441
Because I agreed to give you
mom and dad's car if you did!

591
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,900
Only because you had no other choice!

592
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,510
Zack, Cody, you're twins.

593
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,141
Why are you hurting each other?

594
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:38,182
Yeah, hurting each other...

595
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:39,511
Hurts each other.

596
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,812
Yeah.
Yeah.

597
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:42,583
It would be the same as hurting...

598
00:32:43,953 --> 00:32:45,224
Yourself.

599
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:48,724
No, no, I don't really agree.

600
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:51,895
Let me demonstrate.
See, if I pinch Zack...

601
00:32:54,195 --> 00:32:56,406
It doesn't cause me any pain.

602
00:32:56,467 --> 00:33:00,478
And if I, for example, splash this glass
of ice-cold water in Cody's face,

603
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:05,578
I don't feel anything.
Thirsty, dry even.

604
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:11,049
And if I flip Zack out of his chair.

605
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,960
Using the element of surprise...

606
00:33:18,903 --> 00:33:20,903
See? I feel nothing.

607
00:33:22,372 --> 00:33:23,933
I've proved my point!

608
00:33:41,057 --> 00:33:43,957
So, uh, whose grandmother
is missing a finger?

609
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:50,239
These look worse than
mom's apricot tuna roll ups.

610
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:53,210
This is the corsican fruit,
the key to all my research.

611
00:33:55,482 --> 00:33:57,541
I guarantee you'll find it's the most
delicious fruit you've ever tasted.

612
00:33:57,612 --> 00:33:59,142
More delicious than mango?
Yes.

613
00:33:59,212 --> 00:34:00,582
More delicious than blueberries?
Yes.

614
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:02,013
More delicious than...
Just eat it.

615
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:13,196
That is amazing!

616
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:16,167
Yeah, it's like...

617
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:17,906
It's like it slithered down my throat,

618
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:20,737
And sent my tummy into a yummy frenzy.

619
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:23,648
It is like, right before
it entered my mouth,

620
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:26,849
It swirled around the
world's largest lollipop.

621
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:29,280
It's like my tongue just
took a bath in a rainbow.

622
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,890
Mine just swam in a peach nectar River.

623
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,091
A peach nectar River?
Seriously?

624
00:34:34,161 --> 00:34:36,131
Oh, like you can take a bath in a rainbow!

625
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,704
Mmm, Bailey...

626
00:34:49,914 --> 00:34:51,844
Please forgive me.

627
00:34:51,914 --> 00:34:53,816
Cody wuv Bailey.

628
00:34:54,645 --> 00:34:56,516
Does Bailey wuv Cody?

629
00:34:56,586 --> 00:34:59,216
Ow! Oh, no, my fingers don't
bend that way, Bailey, stop!

630
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:07,569
Why'd you hit me?

631
00:35:07,629 --> 00:35:11,569
I didn't hit you.
I must've just fell.

632
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:14,040
Then why does my arm hurt?

633
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,581
I guess I hit it on the way down.

634
00:35:17,641 --> 00:35:19,853
Let's just go to sleep.

635
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:23,952
You go to sleep.
No, you go to sleep.

636
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:26,353
Oh, I really need to call Bailey.

637
00:35:26,423 --> 00:35:27,754
I thought she was annoyed with you?

638
00:35:27,823 --> 00:35:30,324
Her and I finally had something in common.

639
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:34,236
Well, she was. That's why I decided
to give her all that time.

640
00:35:34,295 --> 00:35:35,767
You know, it's scientifically proven,

641
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:37,667
You never confront a
woman when she's angry.

642
00:35:37,737 --> 00:35:38,967
Or calm, for that matter.

643
00:35:39,877 --> 00:35:41,807
Oh, Cody...

644
00:35:43,177 --> 00:35:45,308
No cell phones.

645
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:47,749
It's one of the few rules
we have around here.

646
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:49,118
I really need to call my girlfriend.

647
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,388
It's impossible.

648
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,790
I know, right?
No, no, no, it's true.

649
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,490
He has a girlfriend.
Well, he had a girlfriend.

650
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:00,732
No, what I meant was that the
cell phone's microwave radiation.

651
00:36:00,802 --> 00:36:03,032
May affect some of our
more delicate instruments.

652
00:36:03,102 --> 00:36:04,873
We wouldn't wanna risk a malfunction.

653
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:11,514
Good man.

654
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:13,515
I hope you both slept well.
Today, I'm going to be observing.

655
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:15,846
While you both perform a series of
sports and training exercises...

656
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:17,456
Pass.

657
00:36:17,515 --> 00:36:19,156
Actually, he can't pass.

658
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:21,956
Or run, or kick, or hit, or score...

659
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:25,026
Sports and I have
a complicated relationship.

660
00:36:25,097 --> 00:36:27,369
Walking and you have
a complicated relationship.

661
00:36:27,428 --> 00:36:30,240
Still, it may provide valuable insights.

662
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:33,310
As to how well twins
work together as a unit.

663
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:39,342
Well, I guess if it's
for science, then okay.

664
00:36:39,412 --> 00:36:40,411
Good man.

665
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:05,247
Hey, here's a fun fact.

666
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:07,518
You can actually hit the
ball with these things.

667
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:10,319
Oh, hit it?
I couldn't even see the thing.

668
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:19,332
How come we don't have matching outfits?

669
00:37:20,302 --> 00:37:21,532
You sicken me.

670
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:33,985
Watch it!
Hey, you watch it.

671
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,456
No.

672
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:00,952
It's okay. You'll do...

673
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:02,281
Better next time.

674
00:38:02,351 --> 00:38:03,522
Yeah.
Yeah.

675
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:05,081
The double team!
The double team!

676
00:38:06,623 --> 00:38:07,923
They seem weird to you?

677
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:08,995
I think they're nice.

678
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:30,520
Yeah!
Yeah!

679
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,589
Here goes nothing.

680
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,920
Whoa!

681
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,220
Ow!

682
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:42,863
No, I'm climbing back down.

683
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:44,703
Are you serious?

684
00:38:44,773 --> 00:38:47,573
Well, actually, I'm a little
more introspective.

685
00:38:47,643 --> 00:38:49,444
If they can do it, we can.

686
00:38:51,443 --> 00:38:52,945
Don't look down!

687
00:38:56,155 --> 00:38:59,386
Man, you're so weak.
How do you even button your shirt?

688
00:38:59,457 --> 00:39:01,527
My muscles are crying.

689
00:39:01,587 --> 00:39:03,797
It's called sweat!

690
00:39:03,857 --> 00:39:06,098
Don't fall, Cody.
Cody, don't fall! Cody!

691
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:07,528
I'm falling!

692
00:39:10,438 --> 00:39:12,338
I'm falling, I'm falling!

693
00:39:16,911 --> 00:39:19,441
Are you feeling something weird?

694
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:21,182
Can't a guy scratch in peace?

695
00:39:22,012 --> 00:39:23,922
No, not that.

696
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:26,953
I'm feeling whatever you're feeling.

697
00:39:27,023 --> 00:39:29,724
You know how crazy this is?

698
00:39:29,794 --> 00:39:32,924
Forget it. I've flossed with
thicker strings than this.

699
00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:34,734
What do they have that we don't have?

700
00:39:34,795 --> 00:39:37,766
Lack of fear, upper body strength.

701
00:39:37,837 --> 00:39:39,566
Wills that are notarized.

702
00:39:39,636 --> 00:39:42,037
Trust me,
I'm a five-star athlete.

703
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,689
My leg is
falling asleep. Oh, no!

704
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,920
My leg is falling
asleep, too. Push!

705
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,060
I am pushing.
You push!

706
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,361
You know I have weak wrists!

707
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,944
No, no, no.
Don't take it!

708
00:40:11,014 --> 00:40:13,174
Every fallen petal is gonna represent.

709
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,345
One more phone call you don't get from him.

710
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:21,156
Maybe Cody hasn't called because
his phone ran out of battery,

711
00:40:21,226 --> 00:40:24,096
Or he's been abducted by aliens,

712
00:40:24,157 --> 00:40:25,858
Or a secret society of pilgrims,

713
00:40:25,928 --> 00:40:28,898
Disguised as aliens so we don't
know that they're pilgrims.

714
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,169
And you really think that's possible?

715
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:33,908
Sure! People's phones run out
of battery all the time!

716
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,210
No, no, no. See, Cody
stopped calling me.

717
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,280
Just becau I was ignoring him.

718
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,380
Well, lots of people ignore me.

719
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,282
Just do what I do.
Ignore them back.

720
00:40:43,353 --> 00:40:46,553
Except I'm not sure if they notice
because they're ignoring me.

721
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:49,293
He thinks by not calling me after
I didn't answer his calls,

722
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:52,094
That I'll be weakened, call him,

723
00:40:52,164 --> 00:40:53,835
And then he doesn't have to call me again.

724
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:55,565
But didn't he call you the first time?

725
00:40:55,635 --> 00:40:57,436
Only so I could ignore him.

726
00:40:57,506 --> 00:40:59,036
He thinks he's the ultimate strategist.

727
00:41:00,436 --> 00:41:02,037
But like my grammy Pickett says,

728
00:41:02,107 --> 00:41:05,377
"you can put your boots in the oven,
but that don't make 'em biscuits."

729
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:07,117
Unless you add flour and eggs.

730
00:41:07,177 --> 00:41:08,417
I mean, sure, they're still chewy, but...

731
00:41:08,478 --> 00:41:11,019
You know what? Game on, Cody.
I'll show him.

732
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:12,819
What are you going to do?

733
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,530
Check this.

734
00:41:18,931 --> 00:41:20,401
Not the big "d."

735
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:23,332
Oh, yes. Oh,
it must be done.

736
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:24,832
I can't watch.
Tell me when it's over.

737
00:41:26,142 --> 00:41:28,973
Cody Martin, you are now and forever...

738
00:41:31,713 --> 00:41:33,114
...Deleted!

739
00:41:38,536 --> 00:41:41,045
Dr. Olsen,

740
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:47,317
Zack and I have been experiencing
some strange phenomenon.

741
00:41:47,387 --> 00:41:49,118
Seems almost a little too improbable.

742
00:41:49,188 --> 00:41:50,219
I feel what he feels.

743
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:52,189
Why must you complicate everything?

744
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,430
Well, it wouldn't be complicated if
you didn't only have one brain cell.

745
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,929
Which is going to die alone.

746
00:41:56,999 --> 00:41:58,930
This is perfect.
This is better than perfect.

747
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,171
Wait a minute.
What's better than perfect?

748
00:42:01,231 --> 00:42:02,971
Let's stick with perfect.
Come with me.

749
00:42:04,842 --> 00:42:08,273
Just to be clear, I'm hooked up
to this thing again because?

750
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:09,813
The results should be different this time.

751
00:42:09,883 --> 00:42:11,113
Starting.

752
00:42:17,986 --> 00:42:19,185
Ow!

753
00:42:19,256 --> 00:42:20,696
What are you complaining about?

754
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:22,255
I'm the one who got shocked.

755
00:42:22,325 --> 00:42:23,896
I definitely felt pain.

756
00:42:26,897 --> 00:42:28,268
Ow!
Ow!

757
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:31,508
Would you stop that?
No, you stop it!

758
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:33,539
It's the effects of the corsican fruit.

759
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:37,109
When eaten by twins, it creates
a telepathic communication.

760
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,249
That's genius.

761
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:40,880
Yes, it is.
And that's only stage one.

762
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:44,252
Zack, Cody, are you ready for stage two?

763
00:42:44,322 --> 00:42:45,492
Yes, we are.

764
00:42:45,552 --> 00:42:47,562
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold the Joy buzzer.

765
00:42:47,623 --> 00:42:49,263
What's stage two?

766
00:42:49,322 --> 00:42:51,634
Empathy.
Creating an emotional connection.

767
00:42:51,693 --> 00:42:54,034
Where stage one created a physical one.

768
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:56,804
Are you prepared?

769
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,705
Yes. Ow!

770
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:02,106
That's a no.
No. That's a yes. Ow!

771
00:43:02,176 --> 00:43:04,216
I heard a no.
Dr. Olsen has vision!

772
00:43:08,617 --> 00:43:11,788
Just like you to run off
before you finish something.

773
00:43:11,888 --> 00:43:14,389
Oh yeah? Well, I'm finished
being a human lightning rod.

774
00:43:14,459 --> 00:43:16,430
By now, I can recharge my own cell phone.

775
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,201
You know, if you leave,
I can't finish my internship.

776
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,970
But you couldn't care less, could you?

777
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,701
Wow, Cody. Actually,
I could care less.

778
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:26,702
And I'm sick of you blaming me for
everything that goes wrong in your life.

779
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:28,973
I only do that because you are to blame!

780
00:43:29,043 --> 00:43:30,513
Yeah?

781
00:43:30,582 --> 00:43:33,284
Give me one example
of how I ruined your life!

782
00:43:33,354 --> 00:43:34,615
Two weeks...
That doesn't count.

783
00:43:34,685 --> 00:43:35,985
What about when...
Nope, not that time either.

784
00:43:36,055 --> 00:43:38,456
Fine. If you hadn't
completely messed up.

785
00:43:38,526 --> 00:43:40,286
My internship
with Dr. Spaulding,

786
00:43:40,356 --> 00:43:42,996
I could be there, as far
away from you as possible.

787
00:43:43,056 --> 00:43:44,766
That's not my fault,

788
00:43:44,826 --> 00:43:46,666
Because if you had just given
me the car in the first place

789
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:49,367
I wouldn't have needed to
follow you down to spaulding's.

790
00:43:49,437 --> 00:43:50,839
To make you change your mind!

791
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:52,938
A car you're never gonna see now!

792
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:55,610
Oh, ok. Cool. Cool guy.
Goodbye, Cody.

793
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:58,350
Fine, go!

794
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:01,550
Just one more on the list of
things I'll never forgive you for.

795
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,781
You know, out of all the twins I
could have gotten stuck with,

796
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:05,021
Why did it have to be you?

797
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:11,094
Oh. Because you think
it's so easy.

798
00:44:11,164 --> 00:44:13,564
To be the twin of a guy who actually cares.

799
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:16,164
Why a carrot is more orange than an orange!

800
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:22,806
Yeah?
How about this?

801
00:44:22,876 --> 00:44:24,377
Don't you do it!

802
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,317
Take that digit away
from that nasal vestibule.

803
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:30,587
Unsanitary! Unsanitary.

804
00:44:33,529 --> 00:44:35,889
You know that sound
that you just love so much?

805
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:37,729
No, don't do it!
Don't do it, Cody.

806
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:39,329
Here it comes.

807
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:41,131
Ooh, cracking!

808
00:44:46,571 --> 00:44:49,672
Oh, yeah?
How about this, huh?

809
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,813
That's not fair. Zack, that's not fair.
I'm wearing briefs!

810
00:44:53,883 --> 00:44:57,754
Yeah, well, now they'll have a nice
runway for when you take them off!

811
00:45:03,627 --> 00:45:06,297
Yeah? You ready for this?
You're not even gonna see this coming.

812
00:45:32,393 --> 00:45:33,534
Are you leaving?

813
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:36,104
I wouldn't say leaving.
More escaping.

814
00:45:36,164 --> 00:45:37,334
Can we go for a walk first?

815
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,205
I can't.
I really have to...

816
00:45:43,816 --> 00:45:45,316
After you.

817
00:45:50,088 --> 00:45:52,359
It's hard to be a twin, huh?

818
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:55,389
No. It's hard
to be Cody's twin.

819
00:45:55,459 --> 00:45:57,629
Being kellie's twin
looks like a lot of fun.

820
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,230
Kellie and I used to fight.

821
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,399
But through the Noble work Dr.
Olsen is doing,

822
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,401
We learned how to get along.

823
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:05,641
Besides, once the merge happens,

824
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,243
Everything will feel right to you.

825
00:46:07,313 --> 00:46:10,343
The merge?
I like where this is going.

826
00:46:10,413 --> 00:46:13,783
Not with me, silly.
With Cody.

827
00:46:15,214 --> 00:46:17,184
And I just threw up
in my mouth a little bit.

828
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:19,325
Zack, your brother needs you.

829
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:21,125
Cody doesn't need anyone but Cody.

830
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:25,366
You're wrong. You'll see.
The merge will fix everything.

831
00:46:25,426 --> 00:46:28,467
Cody needs you here.
We all need you here.

832
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:29,738
Please, Zack?

833
00:46:48,921 --> 00:46:50,962
She's never gonna forgive me.

834
00:47:08,017 --> 00:47:10,417
I'm sorry, Cody,

835
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:13,888
But without Zack, you're of no use to me.

836
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:16,489
But, Dr.
Olsen, can you just... No.

837
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:19,960
Fine.
I'll do the next stage.

838
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:23,131
Why'd you come back?
I thought you said you hated this.

839
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:24,640
Nellie convinced me I should stay.

840
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,112
Besides, there's no plane
till tomorrow anyway, so...

841
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,144
Good choice, Zack.
Kellie.

842
00:47:33,214 --> 00:47:36,354
Let's just get this over with.
What do I have to do?

843
00:47:36,414 --> 00:47:39,624
The corsican fruit, stage two.

844
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:47,666
Mmm!

845
00:47:49,037 --> 00:47:50,637
Mmm!

846
00:47:50,707 --> 00:47:53,508
Oh, my God. That's like a
lusciousness of lemon and lime.

847
00:47:53,578 --> 00:47:55,279
It's like a symphony of citrus.

848
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:58,079
It's like a... Got it!
They're fruity. I know.

849
00:47:58,149 --> 00:47:59,209
You want one?

850
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:00,310
They're for you.
Don't.

851
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:10,462
...Talking to yourself.
Bad sign.

852
00:48:10,532 --> 00:48:13,664
There's the happy couple.
I sent you a fruit cake.

853
00:48:14,663 --> 00:48:16,533
Also, there's...
Hello, Bailey!

854
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:18,374
There you are.
I have been looking for you.

855
00:48:18,434 --> 00:48:20,335
Mr. Moseby,
I deleted Cody.

856
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:23,246
I'm sorry to hear about that.

857
00:48:23,305 --> 00:48:25,046
He just got me so mad.

858
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:27,417
Do you think I went too far?

859
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,086
You know, really not for me to say.

860
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:31,618
Look, I found this on the deck.
It's addressed to you.

861
00:48:31,688 --> 00:48:33,058
My work is done.

862
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,929
It's from Cody.
Should I open it?

863
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:37,658
I'm gonna take a leap here.

864
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,398
I think that was his intention.

865
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,100
No.
No, you know what?

866
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,070
I'm not gonna give him that satisfaction.

867
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:44,671
All right.
Then don't open it!

868
00:48:44,741 --> 00:48:47,642
On the other hand, don't
I at least owe him that?

869
00:48:47,712 --> 00:48:49,312
Then open it.

870
00:48:49,372 --> 00:48:52,813
Well, when he texted me and I
didn't reply, he stopped calling.

871
00:48:52,883 --> 00:48:54,083
Don't open it.

872
00:48:54,153 --> 00:48:56,153
But on the other hand,
he was reaching out to me.

873
00:48:56,213 --> 00:48:57,313
Open it!

874
00:48:57,384 --> 00:48:58,984
But what if he...
open it!

875
00:48:59,054 --> 00:49:01,326
Open it!
For the love of brevity, open it!

876
00:49:04,326 --> 00:49:05,896
I should, right?

877
00:49:09,296 --> 00:49:10,468
Okay.

878
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:17,240
"dear Bailey, forgive me for
writing this in a note."

879
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:19,509
More like a novel.

880
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:22,020
"internship," blah, blah, blah.

881
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,651
"spring break," blah, blah, blah.

882
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:29,461
"scholarship to Yale?"
wait. So...

883
00:49:29,522 --> 00:49:31,832
"so if I want to go to
the school of my dreams,

884
00:49:31,892 --> 00:49:34,663
"I can't be with the girl of my dreams.

885
00:49:34,733 --> 00:49:37,403
"I'm sorry. And please
recycle this after reading.

886
00:49:37,473 --> 00:49:38,975
"love, Cody."

887
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:42,075
Oh!

888
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:45,875
Oh, no.
What have I done?

889
00:49:45,945 --> 00:49:47,345
It wasn't even that good.
I know. Right?

890
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:51,387
Hey, guys.
Guys, I was all wrong.

891
00:49:51,457 --> 00:49:53,759
About that hillbilly hairdo,
those hoe-down heels,

892
00:49:53,828 --> 00:49:56,628
Or thinking it's cute to call
flossing your teeth, "goin' ropin"?

893
00:49:56,689 --> 00:50:00,599
No. I mean, this whole time
I've been wrong about Cody.

894
00:50:00,669 --> 00:50:02,230
Good, good.
Let it out.

895
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,030
He's selfish,
he's a know-it-all...

896
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,602
Don't you dare criticize
the sweetest fellow on earth!

897
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:11,042
He has the wings of an angel.

898
00:50:11,112 --> 00:50:12,112
An angel!

899
00:50:12,181 --> 00:50:13,713
You didn't let me finish.

900
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,284
I know.

901
00:50:17,354 --> 00:50:18,924
He didn't want to spend
his spring break with me,

902
00:50:18,984 --> 00:50:21,224
But he couldn't if he wanted
to get a scholarship to Yale.

903
00:50:21,294 --> 00:50:23,355
I know, I know.
He was trying to tell you that, but...

904
00:50:23,425 --> 00:50:26,866
I know! He's emotionally stunted.
Isn't it wonderful?

905
00:50:26,926 --> 00:50:28,736
We have to go to the marine biology reserve.

906
00:50:28,797 --> 00:50:30,267
And find Cody and apologize.

907
00:50:30,337 --> 00:50:32,808
Why do I have to apologize?
I didn't do anything to him.

908
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:35,108
Wait, which one's Cody again?
Come on.

909
00:50:35,178 --> 00:50:36,738
You feeling anything yet?

910
00:50:36,808 --> 00:50:38,278
Not yet.

911
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,149
Thanks for coming back.

912
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,550
Whatever.

913
00:50:44,191 --> 00:50:46,191
Darn right I saved your butt.

914
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,651
I didn't say that.

915
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,762
Oh, well, you should have.

916
00:50:51,892 --> 00:50:53,493
No, I didn't say it.

917
00:50:54,032 --> 00:50:55,202
I felt it.

918
00:50:55,263 --> 00:50:57,003
I'm going to think of an emotional memory.

919
00:50:57,073 --> 00:50:59,235
You tell me if you feel what I feel.

920
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,345
Come on, you're not still bummed.

921
00:51:02,405 --> 00:51:04,045
About that stupid little hamster, are you?

922
00:51:04,116 --> 00:51:05,876
That's incredible.

923
00:51:05,946 --> 00:51:07,576
Zack, that's exactly what I was...

924
00:51:13,758 --> 00:51:18,129
You set my hamster Sigmund Freud free?

925
00:51:18,198 --> 00:51:19,329
How did you know that?

926
00:51:19,398 --> 00:51:21,260
I can feel your paralyzing guilt.

927
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:23,430
Well, you're the one who should be guilty,

928
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,970
Saddling him with a name like Sigmund.

929
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,741
I saved him years of hamster
High School embarrassment.

930
00:51:28,811 --> 00:51:30,511
I loved Sigmund Freud.

931
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:33,012
Mommy and I bonded over him.

932
00:51:41,093 --> 00:51:44,926
Okay. Not only are you
gonna break my spirit,

933
00:51:44,995 --> 00:51:47,025
But you're gonna mock me as well?

934
00:51:47,095 --> 00:51:48,996
I'm not mocking you.

935
00:51:57,608 --> 00:51:58,678
I'm fee (zack moans)

936
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,108
Why are you crying harder?

937
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:01,919
Because...

938
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:08,322
I finally see what it meant
to you to get into Yale.

939
00:52:09,622 --> 00:52:12,033
It was your life,

940
00:52:12,093 --> 00:52:14,332
And I messed it all up.

941
00:52:14,402 --> 00:52:16,033
I'm sorry.

942
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:19,373
I know you're sorry.

943
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:22,645
You're really sorry, Zack.
You really are.

944
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:24,946
I know. Oh, no.
I know you know.

945
00:52:25,015 --> 00:52:27,116
And I know you know I know.

946
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:28,416
Yeah.

947
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:32,087
Oh. Zack.

948
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,827
That's why you wanted the car?

949
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,498
Exactly.

950
00:52:39,399 --> 00:52:41,429
Cody,

951
00:52:41,499 --> 00:52:43,329
You know what you wanna do with your life.

952
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,470
So does Bailey.

953
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,941
Even London knows exactly who she is.

954
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:50,140
I'm the only one who doesn't.

955
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,042
I know that somewhere out there

956
00:52:52,112 --> 00:52:55,283
I'm great at something.
I just need to find it.

957
00:52:55,353 --> 00:52:58,855
And I could find it a lot
faster with a cool sports car.

958
00:53:01,394 --> 00:53:03,054
You will find it.

959
00:53:03,124 --> 00:53:05,525
And when you do, I know
you'll be great at it.

960
00:53:07,995 --> 00:53:09,466
Come on.

961
00:53:10,137 --> 00:53:11,396
Come on.

962
00:53:14,979 --> 00:53:15,978
Mmm.

963
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:18,779
Mmm.

964
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:20,248
That feels great.

965
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:21,409
You're warm, kid.

966
00:53:22,919 --> 00:53:24,180
We should really...

967
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,990
We should do this more often.

968
00:53:26,051 --> 00:53:27,690
Good work getting Zack to stay.

969
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,990
Thank you, Dr. Olsen.

970
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:32,432
Nellie, you have been
invaluable to this project.

971
00:53:32,493 --> 00:53:36,033
I think Zack and Cody are
almost ready for the merge.

972
00:53:36,103 --> 00:53:38,233
Nellie was telling me
something about the merge.

973
00:53:38,303 --> 00:53:40,274
Although, unfortunately, it
wasn't what I hoped it would be.

974
00:53:40,334 --> 00:53:42,643
It's a shame Cody has to lose his brain.

975
00:53:43,474 --> 00:53:44,805
He's so talented.

976
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:47,476
But everyone must sacrifice
for the greater good.

977
00:53:47,546 --> 00:53:51,146
Except me. My good is greater
than the greater good.

978
00:53:51,217 --> 00:53:53,457
It is greater, isn't...
Yes, come on.

979
00:54:01,769 --> 00:54:05,400
Well, that doesn't sound promising.

980
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:07,571
Lose my brain?

981
00:54:07,641 --> 00:54:10,942
But I love my brain.
I'm the brainy one, Zack.

982
00:54:11,011 --> 00:54:12,882
Without my brain I'd just be (stammers)

983
00:54:12,942 --> 00:54:14,242
The one?

984
00:54:14,312 --> 00:54:16,483
Okay, okay, okay.
Hold on, hold on.

985
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,053
Now, while we still have our brains,

986
00:54:18,123 --> 00:54:20,683
I suggest that we listen to
them telling us to leave.

987
00:54:20,753 --> 00:54:22,495
We can't leave.
We can't leave.

988
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:24,856
If this is what Dr.
Olsen has planned this for us,

989
00:54:24,926 --> 00:54:26,425
Then what about all the other twins?

990
00:54:26,495 --> 00:54:28,225
We have to save them.

991
00:54:28,295 --> 00:54:32,367
I can feel that you're right.
Man, I hate empathy.

992
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:35,308
Okay, we have to get into his office.

993
00:54:35,378 --> 00:54:38,137
We got to find a way and
find out what's going on.

994
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,508
Come on,
let's go. Careful.

995
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:42,419
Okay. Go, go!
Secretly, secretly!

996
00:54:53,831 --> 00:54:55,501
Okay.

997
00:54:55,562 --> 00:54:56,764
Now...

998
00:54:56,834 --> 00:54:59,974
We can climb that catwalk,
shimmy down that pole,

999
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:01,134
Go in through the air vent,

1000
00:55:01,204 --> 00:55:02,744
Come out near the lighting system,

1001
00:55:02,804 --> 00:55:04,574
Then we just kick a hole
through the ceiling.

1002
00:55:04,644 --> 00:55:07,715
And we drop down right above
the instrument panels.

1003
00:55:11,286 --> 00:55:12,556
Or.

1004
00:55:15,528 --> 00:55:18,289
Well, sure.
If you want to do it the boring way.

1005
00:55:23,899 --> 00:55:25,240
This. This.

1006
00:55:31,682 --> 00:55:32,941
Oh, here we go.

1007
00:55:34,153 --> 00:55:36,513
"stage one, the phical connection.

1008
00:55:39,123 --> 00:55:41,924
"stage two, the emotional connection.

1009
00:55:44,124 --> 00:55:46,565
"stage three.

1010
00:55:46,624 --> 00:55:48,836
"the merge."
okay.

1011
00:55:48,896 --> 00:55:51,036
"during the merge, the twins become one.

1012
00:55:51,106 --> 00:55:54,137
"no longer individuals,
their identities consolidated

1013
00:55:54,206 --> 00:55:57,638
"into a single self,
able to be controlled."

1014
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:00,207
Even not kwing what that
means, I know it's not good.

1015
00:56:00,918 --> 00:56:02,648
It gets worse.

1016
00:56:02,718 --> 00:56:04,420
How could it get any worse?

1017
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:09,291
"stage four. Hive mind."

1018
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:10,991
yeah, that sounds worse.

1019
00:56:11,061 --> 00:56:14,392
"once the merged twins are assembled,

1020
00:56:14,462 --> 00:56:17,762
"they can be controlled
under a single voice."

1021
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:21,844
I hear a single voice.
It's saying, "run!"

1022
00:56:21,904 --> 00:56:24,204
We've got to free all those other twins.

1023
00:56:24,274 --> 00:56:27,414
And most important, we have to avoid
eating any more of that fruit.

1024
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:30,516
Which you are eating now!

1025
00:56:30,586 --> 00:56:33,956
It was here, and I was like, "mmm,
that looks good. I'll take one."

1026
00:56:34,017 --> 00:56:35,357
Zack, how could you do that?

1027
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:38,799
It's impulse eating.
It's a real problem.

1028
00:56:42,029 --> 00:56:43,969
What happens if only one
of us eats the fruit?

1029
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:45,640
I don't know.
I don't know.

1030
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,240
Why are you repeating me?
Why are you repeating me?

1031
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:51,841
I'm reating you,
aren't I? Ugh.

1032
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:53,941
That's weird. It's like
you say something.

1033
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:56,013
And then I feel the need to say it.

1034
00:56:56,083 --> 00:57:00,424
The next stage.
You're becoming me.

1035
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:03,554
I don't want to be you.
I want to be me.

1036
00:57:04,694 --> 00:57:05,865
I gotta be me.

1037
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:08,935
Well, well, well, well,

1038
00:57:09,566 --> 00:57:10,836
Well.

1039
00:57:10,906 --> 00:57:12,737
That's a pretty deep well.

1040
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,960
Trust me, Wally.
There is a wall there.

1041
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:31,491
Dr. Spaulding?
Dr. Spaulding?

1042
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,532
May I help you?

1043
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:36,763
Hi. My name is Bailey.
I'm looking for Cody Martin.

1044
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:41,674
I haven't seen Mr. Martin since he and
his brother destroyed our submarines.

1045
00:57:41,744 --> 00:57:45,214
And I banned them for life.
Mine and theirs. See?

1046
00:57:47,815 --> 00:57:49,286
I have no idea where he is.

1047
00:57:54,587 --> 00:57:56,657
They're in the mountains,
about 50 miles from here.

1048
00:57:56,727 --> 00:57:57,887
How do you know that?

1049
00:57:57,957 --> 00:57:59,158
The dolphins told me.

1050
00:57:59,228 --> 00:58:00,557
You can understand the dolphins?

1051
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:02,328
Yup. Ever since
I was here last time.

1052
00:58:02,398 --> 00:58:04,599
And ate that ugly fruit,
whenever I'm near a fish,

1053
00:58:04,669 --> 00:58:05,771
I can hear what they're thinking.

1054
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,011
Actually, London, dolphins are mammals.

1055
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:11,471
Then why don't they have humps?

1056
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:13,511
Wait, you ate the corsican fruit.

1057
00:58:13,581 --> 00:58:15,411
And now you can hear the dolphins?

1058
00:58:15,481 --> 00:58:18,352
Not just dolphins.
I got cursed out by a crab.

1059
00:58:18,422 --> 00:58:20,282
But I got even with him at dinner.

1060
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,425
That's the key to my research.

1061
00:58:25,495 --> 00:58:27,995
Humans and dolphins have to eat the fruit.

1062
00:58:28,065 --> 00:58:30,366
It was right in front of my
eyes, and under my nose,

1063
00:58:30,436 --> 00:58:33,136
And a little to the left the entire time.

1064
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:35,436
What else did the dolphins say?

1065
00:58:35,506 --> 00:58:37,978
Hey, were they talking about me?

1066
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:40,509
Did they mention my zit?
You know, they are so judgmental.

1067
00:58:40,578 --> 00:58:42,519
They said I look great in this skirt,

1068
00:58:42,578 --> 00:58:44,019
And that Zack and Cody
are at this place called.

1069
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,289
The gemini project
with this guy named Ronald.

1070
00:58:46,349 --> 00:58:47,549
What?

1071
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:49,389
I think Zack and Cody may be in danger.

1072
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,420
Oh, no! It could be a
matter of life or death.

1073
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,331
Those are two really different choices.

1074
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:55,502
Bailey,
call Mr. Moseby,

1075
00:58:55,562 --> 00:58:58,772
Tell him to meet us at the gemini
project on the new old sawmill road.

1076
00:59:01,643 --> 00:59:04,844
So. You know
about the merge.

1077
00:59:04,914 --> 00:59:07,184
Great stuff.
Great stuff.

1078
00:59:07,254 --> 00:59:09,124
And apparently, you've
discovered the next phase.

1079
00:59:10,225 --> 00:59:11,455
The hive mind.

1080
00:59:11,525 --> 00:59:13,257
Groundbreaking research.

1081
00:59:13,327 --> 00:59:15,297
You know, I'd really love to
stick around and talk about it.

1082
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:16,727
Stick around and talk about it.

1083
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:18,627
Who said that?

1084
00:59:18,698 --> 00:59:20,437
I did. He did.
I did. He did.

1085
00:59:20,498 --> 00:59:23,569
Look at that.
A half merge.

1086
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:25,370
No it isn't.
No it isn't.

1087
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,339
A delay from the one to the other.

1088
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:29,650
It's astounding!

1089
00:59:29,711 --> 00:59:31,782
It's a little annoying,
but it's astounding.

1090
00:59:31,852 --> 00:59:33,321
Dr. Olsen,
if you let us go.

1091
00:59:33,381 --> 00:59:34,882
We won't tell anyone what we saw here.

1092
00:59:34,952 --> 00:59:36,553
I can't do that.

1093
00:59:36,623 --> 00:59:39,062
Your participation in this
work is far too important.

1094
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:40,622
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1095
00:59:40,692 --> 00:59:42,363
<i>Yeah.</i>

1096
00:59:42,433 --> 00:59:43,833
<i>Cool, right?</i>

1097
00:59:43,893 --> 00:59:45,264
<i>So cool.</i>

1098
00:59:45,334 --> 00:59:47,504
Wait a minute.
Are you reading each other's minds?

1099
00:59:47,564 --> 00:59:49,636
<i>Shh! I didn't
even say anything.</i>

1100
00:59:49,706 --> 00:59:52,006
<i>I think you should shh
'cause I can hear everything.</i>

1101
00:59:52,076 --> 00:59:53,347
<i>Can you just pay
attention, please?</i>

1102
00:59:53,407 --> 00:59:54,647
Stop doing that!

1103
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:56,846
<i>You know what
I'm thinking, right?</i>

1104
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:59,018
<i>That's a really long hair
coming out of his nose?</i>

1105
00:59:59,747 --> 01:00:01,918
<i>Oh, yeah, it's gross.</i>

1106
01:00:01,988 --> 01:00:03,488
<i>And also, run!</i>

1107
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,959
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1108
01:00:08,029 --> 01:00:09,530
I knew we shouldn't have come here!

1109
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,061
Apparently, stage four must
commence earlier than planned.

1110
01:00:58,093 --> 01:00:59,692
Quick! This way!

1111
01:01:10,535 --> 01:01:12,646
Where are you going, Zack and Cody?

1112
01:01:12,705 --> 01:01:14,777
Where are you going, Zack and Cody?

1113
01:01:14,847 --> 01:01:16,376
Oh, great. Hive mind.

1114
01:01:16,446 --> 01:01:17,917
Oh, great. Hive mind.

1115
01:01:19,117 --> 01:01:20,388
Join us.

1116
01:01:20,448 --> 01:01:21,588
No.

1117
01:01:22,118 --> 01:01:23,358
No.

1118
01:01:23,419 --> 01:01:25,758
Get Zack and Cody!

1119
01:01:25,828 --> 01:01:29,160
Get Zack and Cody!
Get Zack and Cody!

1120
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:30,560
Get Zack and Cody!
Zip line!

1121
01:01:30,631 --> 01:01:33,200
That didn't work so well the last time.

1122
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:37,172
Get Zack and Cody!
Get Zack and Cody!

1123
01:01:37,242 --> 01:01:41,212
Get Zack and Cody!
Get Zack and Cody!

1124
01:01:41,273 --> 01:01:44,013
Get Zack and Cody!
Get Zack and Cody!

1125
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:46,815
Just keep them off the platform.
Hurry.

1126
01:01:46,885 --> 01:01:49,154
I don't know how long I can hold them off.

1127
01:01:49,224 --> 01:01:52,755
Get Zack and Cody!
Get Zack and Cody!

1128
01:01:56,267 --> 01:01:57,467
Zack, helmet.
Helmet.

1129
01:01:57,526 --> 01:01:59,596
Why?
Zip line regulations.

1130
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:01,497
Get back!
Get back!

1131
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:03,769
I said stay back!

1132
01:02:07,179 --> 01:02:08,510
It's just out of my reach.

1133
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:11,011
Stay!

1134
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,081
Okay, on the count of three,
you jump up and grab on.

1135
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:15,351
Okay.

1136
01:02:15,421 --> 01:02:17,251
Three, three, three!
Three, three, three!

1137
01:02:17,851 --> 01:02:19,221
Zack!

1138
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:20,323
Get Zack and Cody!

1139
01:02:20,393 --> 01:02:22,994
Zack!
Zack!

1140
01:02:23,593 --> 01:02:24,733
Zack!

1141
01:02:27,934 --> 01:02:29,835
We did it!

1142
01:02:32,245 --> 01:02:33,476
That was awesome.

1143
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:37,077
Just hold on.
No, no, no, no.

1144
01:02:39,687 --> 01:02:41,647
Yeah!

1145
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:47,128
That put some hair on my chest.

1146
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,530
Get Zack and Cody!

1147
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,601
And now the hair's gone.

1148
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,302
Let's hide in there!

1149
01:02:57,372 --> 01:03:01,373
Oh, yeah, yeah. Let's hide in the
creepy, old, abandoned sawmill.

1150
01:03:01,443 --> 01:03:04,243
That's safe. Why don't we bring
some toddlers in there with us?

1151
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,584
Get Zack and Cody!

1152
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,966
Okay, I think we're safe here.

1153
01:03:19,067 --> 01:03:20,367
Or not.

1154
01:03:21,737 --> 01:03:23,368
Get Zack and Cody!

1155
01:03:25,408 --> 01:03:27,208
Get Zack and Cody!

1156
01:03:27,278 --> 01:03:28,680
Quick!
Climb up that ladder!

1157
01:03:28,749 --> 01:03:30,450
Oh, that looks Rusty!

1158
01:03:30,511 --> 01:03:33,020
I should've got my monthly tetanus shot.

1159
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,251
Dirty ladders are the least
of our problems right now.

1160
01:03:35,321 --> 01:03:36,952
Get Zack and Cody!

1161
01:03:38,792 --> 01:03:40,762
Get Zack and Cody!

1162
01:03:42,362 --> 01:03:44,163
Get Zack and Cody!

1163
01:03:47,804 --> 01:03:50,375
Blades! Why is it
always blades?

1164
01:04:01,887 --> 01:04:04,089
Where's blankie when I need him?

1165
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:11,500
Get Zack and Cody!

1166
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:15,331
Get Zack and Cody!

1167
01:04:16,871 --> 01:04:18,571
Get Zack and Cody!

1168
01:04:18,641 --> 01:04:20,342
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

1169
01:04:21,582 --> 01:04:22,583
Go, go!

1170
01:04:26,914 --> 01:04:27,914
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1171
01:04:39,768 --> 01:04:40,767
Brother, hide in the trees!

1172
01:04:43,509 --> 01:04:45,137
Okay.
What's happening?

1173
01:04:45,207 --> 01:04:47,339
We're never going to outrun
those more athletic twins.

1174
01:04:47,409 --> 01:04:48,609
We don't have to outrun them.

1175
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:49,949
I just have to outrun you.

1176
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,020
If I perish from heat exhaustion,

1177
01:04:53,079 --> 01:04:54,981
Bury me in a stone tomb, standing up.

1178
01:04:55,051 --> 01:04:56,552
With a piece of broken gold.

1179
01:04:56,622 --> 01:04:58,692
Shh, I think I hear something!

1180
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:01,722
Tell Bailey that I respect her as a woman.

1181
01:05:01,792 --> 01:05:03,333
No.
Okay.

1182
01:05:04,633 --> 01:05:05,963
I think we're safe.

1183
01:05:12,606 --> 01:05:14,206
Get Zack and Cody!

1184
01:05:17,776 --> 01:05:19,447
Get Zack and Cody!

1185
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,560
Climb, climb!

1186
01:05:47,484 --> 01:05:49,254
Get Zack and Cody!

1187
01:06:07,138 --> 01:06:08,739
Okay. Question.

1188
01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:10,650
Do you think it's as far down as it looks?

1189
01:06:11,249 --> 01:06:12,919
It looks
like middle-earth.

1190
01:06:15,121 --> 01:06:19,192
Zack, I want you to know
if our bones get crushed.

1191
01:06:19,992 --> 01:06:23,362
Like cheap test tubes,
which is very likely,

1192
01:06:23,962 --> 01:06:25,563
I just want you to know that...

1193
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:28,564
Yeah. Me, too.

1194
01:06:32,205 --> 01:06:33,244
Okay. On three.

1195
01:06:33,604 --> 01:06:35,375
One, two...

1196
01:06:44,118 --> 01:06:46,929
I landed on my tummy.

1197
01:06:48,999 --> 01:06:50,559
Are you okay?

1198
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:52,659
Yeah. Let's see.

1199
01:06:52,729 --> 01:06:57,442
Leg. Knee. Ribs.

1200
01:06:57,501 --> 01:07:01,212
Not sure what that is.
Yeah, I'm all right.

1201
01:07:01,272 --> 01:07:03,182
We did it, Zack.
We made it!

1202
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:12,555
Get Zack and Cody!
Get Zack and Cody!

1203
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:16,526
Get Zack and Cody!
Get Zack and Cody!

1204
01:07:16,596 --> 01:07:19,565
Get Zack and Cody!
Get Zack and Cody!

1205
01:07:19,637 --> 01:07:20,836
Or not.

1206
01:07:27,178 --> 01:07:29,779
Oh, good.
You're awake.

1207
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:31,480
Oh, good.
You're an evil idiot.

1208
01:07:31,549 --> 01:07:34,279
Right. I'm an idiot, you're the
one that's locked down and wired.

1209
01:07:34,349 --> 01:07:36,290
He's got a good point.

1210
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:39,291
Cody, why are we strapped down to
the mind transference facilitator?

1211
01:07:39,361 --> 01:07:42,092
Because once I push this button,

1212
01:07:42,162 --> 01:07:45,633
The electrons in your brains are
gonna violently smash together,

1213
01:07:45,703 --> 01:07:48,564
And merge into one brain.

1214
01:07:48,635 --> 01:07:50,034
That sounds like it's really going to hurt.

1215
01:07:50,705 --> 01:07:51,805
Yes.

1216
01:07:55,944 --> 01:07:57,376
Where are they?
There they are!

1217
01:07:57,446 --> 01:07:59,047
Let them go!
Stay back!

1218
01:08:00,816 --> 01:08:02,347
Careful! Nobody move.

1219
01:08:03,618 --> 01:08:04,818
Cody!
Bailey!

1220
01:08:04,888 --> 01:08:05,889
Woody!
Zack!

1221
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:07,128
London!

1222
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,000
Woody.
, son...

1223
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:16,400
Woody, what are you...
No, no, don't...

1224
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:21,742
Dang it.

1225
01:08:21,812 --> 01:08:25,013
There's an electrical force field
surrounding the perimeter of the platform.

1226
01:08:25,353 --> 01:08:26,653
Duh.

1227
01:08:26,712 --> 01:08:29,183
Perfect timing,
Dr. Spaulding.

1228
01:08:29,253 --> 01:08:31,754
We meet once again,
Dr. Olsen.

1229
01:08:31,824 --> 01:08:34,495
I'm going to disintegrate
your individual minds now.

1230
01:08:36,466 --> 01:08:40,036
Ronald, before you merge them,

1231
01:08:40,097 --> 01:08:42,067
Why don't you show them who you really are?

1232
01:09:02,762 --> 01:09:05,793
Wow, that is a pretty
intense chemical peel.

1233
01:09:05,863 --> 01:09:07,563
I had a feeling
this guy was two-faced!

1234
01:09:07,633 --> 01:09:11,435
Meet Ronald spaulding, my evil twin brother.

1235
01:09:11,505 --> 01:09:13,104
Who disappeared two years ago.

1236
01:09:13,175 --> 01:09:16,005
When the scientific
community threw him out.

1237
01:09:16,075 --> 01:09:19,517
But I was here the whole time, waiting,

1238
01:09:19,586 --> 01:09:21,516
Developing my brilliant plan.

1239
01:09:21,586 --> 01:09:23,017
But if you're also a twin.

1240
01:09:23,087 --> 01:09:25,857
Then why would you want
all twins to think alike?

1241
01:09:25,927 --> 01:09:29,658
So no one would ever have to suffer
the pain that I did as a twin.

1242
01:09:29,729 --> 01:09:33,170
Him, getting all the awards.
Him, the brilliant one.

1243
01:09:33,229 --> 01:09:34,970
Him, the award winner.

1244
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:36,271
I feel you, brother.

1245
01:09:36,341 --> 01:09:39,371
So you stole my work
to use for your own evil.

1246
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,112
I did.
But how?

1247
01:09:41,171 --> 01:09:45,142
It was easy.
First, I posed as a janitor.

1248
01:09:45,212 --> 01:09:47,554
Where I methodically stole your data.

1249
01:09:47,613 --> 01:09:49,514
I designed this entire facility myself.

1250
01:09:49,584 --> 01:09:52,484
It's completely state of
the art and wicked cool!

1251
01:09:53,925 --> 01:09:55,955
Well, that looks promising.

1252
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:11,049
When I read Cody's paper on twins,

1253
01:10:11,108 --> 01:10:14,449
I thought he and his brother
would be a great asset.

1254
01:10:14,519 --> 01:10:17,590
So I went to the boat and I spied on them.

1255
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:20,492
I am so excited.
I've been planning our trip for a month.

1256
01:10:20,562 --> 01:10:22,021
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

1257
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:23,862
That's what was in the letter!

1258
01:10:23,932 --> 01:10:25,363
Why did you drop it, then?

1259
01:10:25,433 --> 01:10:26,663
Hey! Hey, hey!

1260
01:10:35,205 --> 01:10:37,916
I knew if I could lure them here,

1261
01:10:37,975 --> 01:10:41,286
I could use them in my research.

1262
01:10:41,346 --> 01:10:46,217
<i>Then all of my years of pain
would finally have a purpose.</i>

1263
01:10:46,287 --> 01:10:51,259
I could create a controlled,
peaceful society!

1264
01:10:51,329 --> 01:10:52,358
Through violence?

1265
01:10:52,428 --> 01:10:54,200
Well, no plan is perfect!

1266
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:55,569
Can I just say something?

1267
01:10:55,639 --> 01:10:57,801
Someone had a big bowl
of grumpy this morning.

1268
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:57,575
The merge is happening!

1269
01:11:57,645 --> 01:12:01,447
You know, we should merge into my brain.
I have the superior intellect.

1270
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,857
You also have the inferior personality.

1271
01:12:03,916 --> 01:12:05,357
I'd rather merge with a rock.

1272
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:11,198
Stop fighting!
You're ruining everything!

1273
01:12:11,258 --> 01:12:13,198
- Stop it!
- You stop it!

1274
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,770
You know I told you
to get your head checked.

1275
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,942
But I'm sure the results
would come back as empty.

1276
01:12:21,012 --> 01:12:22,471
My brain, my brain!

1277
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:24,683
No! No, wait!

1278
01:12:24,742 --> 01:12:27,982
Your brain is all boring.
All you ever do is think.

1279
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:31,524
That's not true.
I also spend an inordinate amount of time.

1280
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:33,494
Worrying about global warming.

1281
01:12:33,553 --> 01:12:37,125
And looking at things in my
closet that need to be pressed.

1282
01:12:37,195 --> 01:12:39,165
Thanks for proving my point.
We're going into my brain.

1283
01:12:45,437 --> 01:12:48,638
Zack...
I'm tired, Zack.

1284
01:12:50,307 --> 01:12:54,320
Cody. If you can hear me,
keep fighting with Zack.

1285
01:12:54,379 --> 01:12:57,090
By fighting, they're creating a
resistance and a power surge.

1286
01:12:57,149 --> 01:12:58,591
To the machine that wants to merge them.

1287
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:00,820
It's as if the thing they do best, arguing,

1288
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:03,331
Is the one thing that can save them.

1289
01:13:03,392 --> 01:13:04,992
I shop really well.
Can we use that?

1290
01:13:08,602 --> 01:13:12,234
No, I can't go into your brain!

1291
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:14,404
You never use your brain.
How do we know it works?

1292
01:13:18,715 --> 01:13:22,286
Well, at least it's not
jam-packed with stupid facts.

1293
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,016
And math thingies with numbers and letters.

1294
01:13:24,086 --> 01:13:25,356
You mean equations?

1295
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:27,558
Stop!
You'll destroy everything.

1296
01:13:27,628 --> 01:13:30,028
You know, I can't spend the rest
of my life in the head of someone.

1297
01:13:30,098 --> 01:13:31,759
Who orders Sushi
well-done.

1298
01:13:31,829 --> 01:13:33,729
Hey, Bailey, where'd you
get your hair done?

1299
01:13:33,799 --> 01:13:35,369
At the groomer's?

1300
01:13:35,429 --> 01:13:37,569
London! What?
I thought we're all joining in.

1301
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,711
One, the number of people who find
you interesting. Including yourself.

1302
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:43,482
Give in to the merge!
Give in!

1303
01:13:43,542 --> 01:13:45,912
Well, I may not be interesting,
but at least I have a car!

1304
01:13:52,893 --> 01:13:56,094
No!

1305
01:14:00,495 --> 01:14:02,097
No! No!

1306
01:14:12,818 --> 01:14:13,818
No!

1307
01:14:19,791 --> 01:14:20,791
No!

1308
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,373
Come here, give me a hug!

1309
01:14:33,273 --> 01:14:34,274
Ooh!

1310
01:14:37,045 --> 01:14:39,816
You've ruined all my work.

1311
01:14:41,486 --> 01:14:43,716
Now, you'll all pay the consequences!

1312
01:14:43,786 --> 01:14:45,487
I'll merge all your minds!

1313
01:14:45,557 --> 01:14:48,157
Wow, you really are a fruit basket.

1314
01:14:49,497 --> 01:14:51,929
Fruit! Zack, fruit!

1315
01:14:52,629 --> 01:14:54,029
But I'm not hungry.

1316
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,630
Got it!

1317
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,200
Bailey.
See that rope on the ground?

1318
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:00,440
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

1319
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:02,241
Here's what I need you to do.

1320
01:15:02,311 --> 01:15:04,511
Come on! Full power!

1321
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:09,083
Now!

1322
01:15:09,723 --> 01:15:11,454
Yee-haw!

1323
01:15:11,524 --> 01:15:13,125
Get along, little crazy scientist.

1324
01:15:16,295 --> 01:15:17,664
Time!

1325
01:15:17,724 --> 01:15:19,025
Let me go!
No.

1326
01:15:19,095 --> 01:15:20,364
I will destroy all of you!

1327
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:21,866
Cody.

1328
01:15:21,936 --> 01:15:24,005
Let me go!

1329
01:15:24,065 --> 01:15:26,507
Dr. Spaulding, eat this, and think
good thoughts about your brother.

1330
01:15:28,337 --> 01:15:29,607
Chew it.

1331
01:15:34,578 --> 01:15:36,889
Donald? Really?

1332
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:39,650
You were always jealous of me?

1333
01:15:40,321 --> 01:15:41,620
But you had everything.

1334
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:44,262
True.
But that's all I knew.

1335
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:47,601
I didn't know how to have fun like you did.

1336
01:15:47,662 --> 01:15:51,574
So, all those years that I
was wishing I could be you,

1337
01:15:51,633 --> 01:15:53,703
You were wishing you could be me?

1338
01:15:53,773 --> 01:15:58,175
More than that.
I was wishing that we were us.

1339
01:16:00,485 --> 01:16:03,117
Ah! Boys,
are you all right?

1340
01:16:03,186 --> 01:16:04,186
We're fine, Mr. Moseby.

1341
01:16:04,256 --> 01:16:05,986
Oh! Thank goodness.

1342
01:16:06,056 --> 01:16:08,387
One more minute and our
personalities would have been gone.

1343
01:16:08,457 --> 01:16:11,098
The one time I get a parking
spot right out front!

1344
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:12,999
Donald.

1345
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:16,239
I was wrong the whole time.
I'm sorry.

1346
01:16:16,309 --> 01:16:18,410
I forgive you, Ronald.

1347
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:21,310
When I get out of prison, let's have lunch.

1348
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:22,810
I'll be here. Waiting.

1349
01:16:23,881 --> 01:16:27,622
I'll be 143, and hungry, but waiting.

1350
01:16:27,691 --> 01:16:28,952
Okay. No fruit.

1351
01:16:29,022 --> 01:16:31,163
No fruit.
Fruity tale.

1352
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:40,435
You know, they make you
guys seem almost normal.

1353
01:16:43,006 --> 01:16:44,475
That was fun.
Want to go shopping?

1354
01:16:44,545 --> 01:16:45,605
No. No shopping.

1355
01:16:45,675 --> 01:16:47,576
How about a sandwich?

1356
01:16:50,388 --> 01:16:53,489
See what we can accomplish
when we work together?

1357
01:16:53,559 --> 01:16:56,689
You know, we make a pretty good team.

1358
01:17:09,573 --> 01:17:11,543
Okay, this was the best spring break ever,

1359
01:17:11,613 --> 01:17:13,343
and we managed to do everything on my list,

1360
01:17:13,413 --> 01:17:16,044
including the museum
of microscopic magnets.

1361
01:17:16,114 --> 01:17:17,814
What was your favorite?

1362
01:17:17,884 --> 01:17:21,125
Well, it's a toss up between the
Erosional Granite Sandstone Sea Cave,

1363
01:17:21,185 --> 01:17:23,185
and that giant ball of twine.

1364
01:17:47,992 --> 01:17:51,393
"Do not park.
Zack Martin exempted."

1365
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:53,323
Perfect.
Sweet ride!

1366
01:17:53,393 --> 01:17:54,663
Hey!

1367
01:17:56,133 --> 01:17:59,064
Thanks for the car.
Isn't she pretty?

1368
01:18:01,775 --> 01:18:03,136
No. No, no.
Zack, Zack!

1369
01:18:06,946 --> 01:18:08,117
Oh, no!

1370
01:18:13,417 --> 01:18:15,818
Ooh, goody!
My summer wardrobe's here!

1371
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:20,361
Well, spring break's over.

1372
01:18:20,431 --> 01:18:22,960
Now, If I could just make
it to summer vacation.
