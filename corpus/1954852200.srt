         you the truth.

616
01:15:50,914 --> 01:15:53,981
         I'm not saying
    I'm without fault here.

617
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:56,484
    I'm not. But I need you
         to understand.

618
01:15:56,486 --> 01:15:58,252
  - Understand how delusional
            you are?

619
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:02,023
          - Not to..
      Sit down. Sit down!

620
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:03,758
  - You want me to understand
      for you killing Eva!

621
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,593
         - Zac, stop!

622
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:07,428
    I need you to calm down.
         Listen to me.

623
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,930
    I need you to understand
           something.

624
01:16:08,932 --> 01:16:11,165
    I will never forgive you
        for killin' Eva.

625
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:12,900
    I need you to understand
      who I think you are

626
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:13,901
  and what you are capable of.

627
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:14,936
        - Let go of me.

628
01:16:14,938 --> 01:16:17,605
          - Zac, Zac,
      what are you doing?

629
01:16:17,607 --> 01:16:19,507
            Zac, no!

630
01:16:19,509 --> 01:16:20,808
      What are you doing?

643
01:20:48,778 --> 01:20:51,278
       Part of me thought
   it would feel kinda good,
           you know?

644
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:04,992
        I keep thinking
    I'm gonna see you wave.

          You and mom.

 Even dad, if you believe that.

649
01:21:29,652 --> 01:21:31,719
     But I know that isn't
         gonna happen.

650
01:21:35,258 --> 01:21:36,657
    I'm just gonna have to..

651
