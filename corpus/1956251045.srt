1
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, let's take the mattress.

2
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,960
Leave it and I'll take it.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,760
-You sure?
-Yeah, no problem.

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,840
All right, I'll start taking this stuff
out of the trunk.

5
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,320
Remind me of home here, man.
Is Segal gonna live with you?

6
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,800
I don't know. I hope so.
She's coming tomorrow.

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,840
I expect to see you around here too.

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,240
-Know a guy named Dennis Newman?
-No, why?

9
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,640
He's the guy that had this apartment
before me, he played here last year.

10
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,520
-That's it, man. All finished here.
-All right, I'll start doing my car.

11
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,080
So they said
everybody was gonna be there.

12
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,120
The mayor, the manager, coach....

13
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,840
Christ,
it's gonna be like a press conference.

14
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,880
I'm afraid they think I'm gonna get them
in the national league single-handedly.

15
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,120
Well, how is your brother?

16
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,880
He's good. He's been really good.
He's doing really well in college.

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,720
He's got a new girlfriend.
Nice one for a change.

18
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,400
I would like to thank
the two young people that came to us.

19
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,960
Speaking about you and Danny.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,320
New residents in our town.

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,280
We have a new citizen.

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
The team's coach, Mr. Yigal Dror.
I understand he's a promising young talent.

23
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
Understanding me.

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,960
And the young man to his left,
Mr. Michael Peterson...

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,400
...who came to us after
a stellar career in Tel Aviv.

26
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,520
He's talking about your career.

27
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,080
It's time Ashdod will
have a good basketball team.

28
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,320
It's time for us to have a good basketball
team. And this year, we'll have it.

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,160
And I think this year it'll happen.

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,440
Thank you very much. Amnon, please.

31
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,160
Yes, we're ready to answer any questions,
please.

32
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,120
They will be glad
to answer the questions.

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,960
We all know how well you have played
in the last two years...

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,920
...but we also know
that you were hurt last year...

35
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,640
...and that you are a year older, over 30.

36
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,000
Can you still play the way
people are hoping here?

37
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,760
I just got back from a month in the States
where I worked on my knee every day.

38
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,120
It's fine.
As far as my age is concerned, I'm 31.

39
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,200
In my mind, that's not retirement age.

40
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Michael, meet Guy, Avi, Oren, Aitan.

41
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,480
They're giving me a hard time in the army,
talk to them.

42
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,800
I'll talk with Amnon. Go get dressed.

43
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,640
Oren. Okay.

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,840
Pay attention. Court, steps, let's go.

45
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,320
Okay.

46
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,320
Oren.

47
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,960
Go on! Move it!

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,920
Guy, wake up!

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,360
Oren, okay.

50
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,600
-Danny, move it, you baboon.
-Let's make a bet, you coward.

51
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,160
Yes, lift your legs up, Kadosh.

52
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,960
Promised me an interview with Michael
Peterson, and to take his photos.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,800
-But when?
-I'll personally take care of it, Joel.

54
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,680
-You have my word.
-You promise? Thanks a lot.

55
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,800
Yes, yes, that's good, Kadosh.

56
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,920
Go.

57
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,360
Stay close to him, stay close to him.

58
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,320
Good, good, Michael.

59
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,920
-Enough with your bullshit.
-What's the matter?

60
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,640
-I know it's you.
-Turn around.

61
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
It's not funny.

62
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,200
We'll take care of it tomorrow. Bye.

63
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,520
Hi, Michael, wait a minute.

64
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,160
-How do you feel?
-I feel fine. A little bit tired.

65
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,080
-How is your knee?
-Knee's okay.

66
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,200
-How long you guys been practicing?
-A week.

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,040
Hey, Michael. I need a picture of you.

68
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,560
-Who is this?
-My name is Joel Levi.

69
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,440
And I cover basketball
for the Ashdod News.

70
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,520
-Is he for us or against us?
-He's okay, he's okay.

71
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,280
I have to go. Come by practice tomorrow?
Yige'al, how do I get to Amnon's office?

72
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,760
As you can see, I'm a businessman.

73
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,240
I don't come from the world of sport.
I know you've been in Israel a few years.

74
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,840
You've dealt with a lot of teams
and team managers...

75
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,040
...who promised you all kinds of things.

76
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,320
What I want you to understand is for me,
you are going to get your money...

77
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,640
...exactly the way it's written
in your contract, right on time.

78
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,200
I want the best for this team.

79
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,080
I brought you here
and I want you to be happy.

80
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,400
I brought a new coach too.
I'm sure you know him.

81
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,680
-Yeah, he was the assistant coach--
-He was the best assistant coach in Israel.

82
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,040
And now he's going to be the best coach
in Israel.

83
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,840
Listen to Amnon. He's a tough guy,
but he knows what he wants.

84
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,760
Don't ask what I went through
with him to bring you here.

85
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,200
-You mean, he didn't want me here?
-No, no, no.

86
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,480
He thought he needed another big man.
I wanted an Israeli big man.

87
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,160
Never mind,
I don't know what goes on in his head.

88
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,080
Main thing is that now he's happy
that you're here with us.

89
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,880
That's what's important. That's it.
I wanted us to get to know each other...

90
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,800
...for me to get to know you
and for you to get to know me.

91
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,120
How do you get to the bus station?
I need to pick somebody up.

92
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,240
Sure, come on.

93
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,920
Did you miss me?

94
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,240
Of course, I missed you.

95
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,200
What happened?

96
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,360
I threw out my knee.

97
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,360
I'm sorry, Segal.

98
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,480
I know, I know.

99
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,600
-There's a grocery store across the street.
-What? I didn't hear you.

100
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,160
I said that there's a grocery store
across the street.

101
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,600
I bought a newspaper.

102
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,360
Anything about me?

103
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Actually, yes.

104
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,120
Already? What's there to write about me?

105
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,840
Come on, what's it say?

106
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,440
It says they shouldn't have brought you
here.

107
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,920
They should've brought somebody else.

108
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,000
-That you aren't what the team needs.
-That's it?

109
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,640
That's bullshit.
They can write whatever they want.

110
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,880
It says that for the money
that you're getting, we need a better player.

111
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,400
Are you really getting $60,000
this season?

112
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,800
What? Who's the asshole that wrote that?
Let me see it.

113
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,880
He's name is Joel. Joel Levi.

114
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,680
That prick. What the hell does he care
how much money I make?

115
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,280
People in this country don't understand
it's none of their business...

116
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,840
...how much somebody makes.
Son of a bitch.

117
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,440
-Do you know him?
-Yeah, I know him.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,200
Oren, Oren.

119
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Okay, guys. Go shoot some penalties.

120
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,640
Michael.

121
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,920
Michael.

122
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,800
Michael,
I need to talk to you for a second.

123
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,360
Not now, I'm busy.

124
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,360
Thank you.

125
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
Hello?

126
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,720
Yes? Fine, thanks.

127
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,040
Yeah, I know who he is.

128
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
He asked me, yeah.

129
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,000
What? What for?
What do you mean do me a favor?

130
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,280
This guy tries to ruin me in his paper and
I'm supposed to give him an interview?

131
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,640
Here? No, no way. No, because
I don't want him coming here.

132
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,680
Yeah, it's only about a block
and a half from here.

133
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,560
All right, yeah.
Tell him I'll be there. Bye.

134
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,800
This guy wants me to give an interview.

135
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,800
-Who's he?
-Amnon, the team manager.

136
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,440
So give him the interview. Why not?

137
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,600
Michael, Michael.

138
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Michael, Michael.

139
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,080
What's your height?

140
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,400
-One minute.
-Thank you.

141
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,600
-Hi.
-Hi.

142
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,440
-Do you feel all right?
-I'm okay.

143
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,000
Please.

144
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,280
Sit.

145
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,680
Why didn't you want us to meet
at your place?

146
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,960
Is that thing on?

147
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,520
No, not yet.

148
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,320
Well, I just moved in
and everything is kind of a mess.

149
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,360
Are you sure you're all right?
We can do this some other time.

150
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,040
No, I must hand it in by tonight.

151
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,800
-But do you mind if I lie back?
-No, sure, go ahead.

152
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,720
Got yourself a little America here.

153
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,440
Pictures and magazines,
where did you get all these?

154
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,040
From my sister. She lives in the States.

155
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,160
Sorry, I'm just-- She sends them to me.

156
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,480
I can just interview myself if you want
me to. I know all the questions by heart.

157
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,400
Okay.

158
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,320
Where did you play
before coming to Israel?

159
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,920
I played two years in the CBA, a year
in Argentina and two years in Spain.

160
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,840
How many years you been in Israel?
Two.

161
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,880
What's the difference between American
and Israeli basketball?

162
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,360
They're the same,
only played by different players.

163
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,280
Managed by different managers,
coached by different coaches.

164
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,440
Do you plan to stay when your career
is over? No, I don't think so.

165
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,520
Why? Don't you like it here?
Yes, I do, but I'm still an American.

166
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,920
-How am I doing so far?
-So-so.

167
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,200
What? Well, you got better questions?

168
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,560
Why didn't you want us to meet
at your place?

169
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,440
To tell you the truth,
I didn't want us to meet at all.

170
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,560
Hi, this is 298053. Leave a message. Bye.

171
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,000
Hi, Segal, it's Michael.

172
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,760
Give me a call. Bye-bye.

173
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,600
-Hello, I'm your neighbor.
-Hi.

174
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,840
I live right there.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

175
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,400
No, it's okay.

176
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,000
I just want to ask--

177
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,440
-Our telephone is out of order and--
-Come on in.

178
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,280
-May I use your telephone?
-No problem.

179
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,600
-Right over here.
-Thank you.

180
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,320
I must call my son.
My wife is feeling not well.

181
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,920
Hello? Yes.

182
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,680
Not good. They asked us
to bring mom to the hospital tomorrow.

183
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,400
...and I think the change is....

184
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,080
Guys, first game, first check.

185
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,680
-Good luck. May we have a good season.
-Thanks.

186
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,000
-So you don't like our country, Michael?
-Is that what he wrote?

187
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,120
That and some other things
you talked about.

188
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,040
He attacked me too,
even more than you.

189
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,800
But I'll take care of it.
Tell me, do you read Hebrew?

190
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,040
No, but my girlfriend
can translate it for me.

191
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,920
Forget it, no big deal.
I'll take care of him.

192
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,560
You know these reporters,
always looking for bad points.

193
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,480
By the way, how is your situation, actually?
Are you really a Jew?

194
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,200
Sure I am.
I took care of that before I got to Israel.

195
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,040
I don't know much about these things.
As I told you, I just pay.

196
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,840
Well, I don't know much about it either.
I just play.

197
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,440
Go, go, go!

198
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,720
Right! Left, left!

199
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,560
Left, left!

200
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,400
Give him the ball!

201
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,160
Good, good!

202
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,320
Good, good, good.

203
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,480
Good, good, good.

204
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,400
Foul. Ball.

205
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
Michael!

206
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,720
Game.

207
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,080
Tell me,
why does he take you out so fast?

208
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,200
I don't know. Ask him.

209
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,560
Listen, Michael.

210
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,960
I wanted to talk to you
about the headline of that article.

211
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,880
I didn't put it in.

212
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,640
It was my editor.

213
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,040
He wants all of the articles
to be much more aggressive.

214
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,520
I was in shock when I saw it.

215
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,040
But, you know,
he does that to me all the time.

216
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,400
Changes things around.

217
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,880
I don't know what you're talking about.
I haven't seen the paper.

218
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,560
Okay, so just so you know.
If you do see it.

219
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,840
Do you want me to bring it to you
tomorrow?

220
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,960
It has your picture in it.

221
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,320
Really, a great one.

222
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,720
Hey.

223
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,600
Do you want this magazine?

224
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,160
My sister brought it.

225
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,720
Your sister sure sends you
a lot of magazines.

226
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,200
-What does she do in America?
-She lives there.

227
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,680
It's eight, seven-- Eight years already.

228
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,000
But she's visiting now,
and she brought this one with her.

229
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,360
Okay, good night.

230
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,920
Come here, come here.

231
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,040
I get you an interview, and you're dissing
both him and me? Are you nuts?

232
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,880
Don't tell me stories about an "editor".
I don't give a crap.

233
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,520
You're not getting on this bus
or standing in the court.

234
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,200
Buy a ticket
and sit in the balcony.

235
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,720
That's all. I don't wanna see you anymore.

236
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,360
I'll be there to spite you.

237
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,280
Hey, Michael.

238
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,680
Could you give me a ride home?

239
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,160
Bye, Michael.

240
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,280
Half the team is there. They want us
to have a drink. Why didn't you come in?

241
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,280
They want you to have a drink.

242
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,960
I've already bugged them enough.

243
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,200
No. Today was the first week, yeah.

244
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,200
There's also an interview with me here
and, of course, I have no idea what it says.

245
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,960
So there, now you've got a reason to come.

246
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Well, maybe the chance for you
to finally learn Hebrew.

247
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,440
It will give you something to do.

248
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,680
Yeah, maybe.

249
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,320
It might not be such a bad idea.

250
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,080
Listen, Segal, I could come to Tel Aviv.

251
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,560
Yes, okay.

252
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
But call first.

253
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,480
This is our first home game.

254
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,440
And it's crucial.

255
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,840
Remember, whatever happens,
don't let him go to the left. All right?

256
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,720
Look, he is a good player.

257
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,960
If you can keep him
from getting his normal 25 points...

258
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,360
...we're gonna win the game.

259
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,040
Now, listen...

260
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,000
...I don't think there has to be
anything personal between us.

261
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,440
We don't have to be friends.

262
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,560
I just want you to respect my decisions,
since I'm the coach.

263
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,360
Is it clear?

264
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,360
Hey.

265
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
All right.

266
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,120
Okay. Yeah.

267
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,440
Okay. Yeah.

268
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,840
Up, up, up.

269
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,960
Up.

270
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,680
What are you doing here? I told
you not to come here anymore.

271
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,360
-I wanna go to my spot.
-You don't have any spot!

272
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,480
You're not going anywhere,
you piece of shit!

273
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
Go watch the game from the balcony!

274
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,800
Get your hands off, you piece of shit.
How dare you touch him?

275
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,000
What's going on?

276
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,520
You better watch out, Amnon.

277
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,080
That man there is Joel's uncle.

278
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,800
Now Amnon didn't let Joel
sit in his place...

279
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,520
...because Joel wrote something
about him last week.

280
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,160
Quite a character, this Joel, huh?

281
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,120
Hey, look at that.

282
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,840
Defense. Defense!

283
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,360
Rebound!

284
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,040
-Start throwing!
-Go in!

285
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,800
Michael.

286
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,440
Go!

287
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,840
Defense! Hands! Hands!

288
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,560
Guard him!

289
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,040
Come on.

290
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,920
Go, team Michael!

291
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,040
Switch. Switch!

292
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,520
You bastard! What's this?

293
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,680
-Hi.
-Hey.

294
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,640
I was just passing by
and I wanted to see how you are feeling.

295
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,440
And I brought you this too.

296
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,600
Oh, thanks.
Thanks a lot, but I've already got it.

297
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,160
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

298
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
-And how do you feel?
-Oh, I'm okay.

299
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,040
-You're sure you are not busy?
-Sure. I'm sure.

300
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,320
-Come on in.
-You know--

301
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,880
-Sit down.
-You know, I know your neighbor.

302
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,960
Mr. Kaufman.

303
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,080
I studied with his son once.

304
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
I used to come here a lot as a kid.

305
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,440
Yeah, I met him.
He seems like a really nice guy.

306
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,840
So when you think you'll be able
to play again?

307
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,880
I don't know. I think I'm gonna need
an operation this time.

308
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,320
It goes pretty fast with this new
arthroscopic thing. The laser beams?

309
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,440
Got a tape of a game
from last season. Wanna see?

310
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,560
-Sure, I wanna see.
-Great.

311
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
You've probably seen it
a few times already.

312
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,880
No, actually, I haven't.
Only seen the first couple of minutes.

313
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,160
Nothing happening so far.

314
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,360
Isn't Derrick Chievous
is playing for Houston?

315
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,160
-Who?
-Derrick Chievous, Band-Aid.

316
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,880
-Band-Aid?
-Yeah. That was his nickname in college.

317
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,600
He used to always play
with Band-Aid on his leg for no reason.

318
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,960
He was first-draft choice of Houston
two or three years ago.

319
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,040
What--? Where did he play college?

320
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,400
Missouri.

321
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,040
I can tell you where every player went
to college.

322
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,720
Is that right? Okay, let's see. Right now.

323
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,680
So let's start with Houston.

324
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,640
Olajuwon, that's easy, Houston.

325
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,040
Sleepy Floyd, Georgetown.

326
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,360
Buck Johnson, Alabama.

327
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,320
Otis Thorpe, Providence.
That's an easy one too.

328
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,880
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, very easy.
You're a little crazy. You know that?

329
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,040
Hello.

330
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,640
Thanks, but you're five minutes early.
It's nice of you to remember.

331
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,080
Listen, I screwed up my knee today.

332
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,640
This son of a bitch came at me
like a truck and went down flat on my knee.

333
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,920
Well, I think I'm gonna need an operation
this time. Yeah.

334
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,320
All right. I thought I'd come tomorrow,
maybe the next day.

335
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,560
Okay.

336
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,240
Hey, thanks for calling, buddy.
All right, bye-bye.

337
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,520
You can add another line to Venezuela.

338
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,240
The guy who lived there before you
is playing there now.

339
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,120
-You know him?
-Sure. But I never got to talk to him.

340
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,280
You know, he was really bad, he smoked
and drank all the time.

341
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,640
Really crazy one. They kicked him out
in the middle of the season.

342
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,560
Ten seconds.

343
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,720
Five, four, three, two, one.

344
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,000
That's it.

345
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,320
I'm 32.

346
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,560
Congratulations.

347
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,320
-Thanks.
-I mean, happy birthday.

348
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,360
I understood. I know a little Hebrew.

349
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,880
Did you ever study?

350
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,400
Started a few times,
went to an ulpan in Tel Aviv.

351
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,680
I started three times.

352
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,160
I finally just gave up. Everybody here
speaks English. It's a lot easier.

353
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,280
It's too easy,
even if you wanna learn Hebrew.

354
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,880
Hello?

355
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,520
Hi, Mom. Thank you.

356
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,720
I know. I miss you too.

357
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,920
I wish I could be there with you.

358
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,520
More than ever, believe me.

359
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,200
Yeah.

360
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Are you kidding?
This is like a B league.

361
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,200
We play in gyms.
We're lucky if a hundred people show up.

362
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,000
Listen, Joel, I need a favor.
Can you give me a lift to Tel Aviv?

363
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,080
I mean, if you're not busy.

364
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,520
I don't know how to drive.

365
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,760
What do you mean?

366
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,000
I mean, I don't have a driver's license.

367
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,920
I don't know how to drive.

368
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,040
You're kidding me. Why not?

369
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,400
I just don't have one.

370
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,920
I never did.

371
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,200
And I never even wanted
to learn how to drive.

372
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,160
Joel, I wanted to-- Sorry.

373
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,840
-What's going on?
-Nothing. I'll talk to you later.

374
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,840
Okay.

375
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,360
That was my sister.

376
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,600
Hey, wait a minute.

377
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,280
Rachel.

378
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,240
No, I'm not from New York City.
I'm from Schenectady.

379
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,000
Yes, I know where that is.

380
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,040
-Listen, will it be okay if I pick you up at 8?
-Yeah, that's fine.

381
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,840
So, what do you do in New York?

382
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,680
-I'm studying.
-Rachel is finishing her studies at Juilliard.

383
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,800
She plays the piano.

384
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,680
Yes, but the real musician in our family
is Joel.

385
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,200
He probably hasn't told you
that he plays.

386
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,280
He played the piano.
He could've been a marvelous musician.

387
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,960
-Hey, Rachel.
-What are you doing covering basketball?

388
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,760
-You should be playing the piano.
-It doesn't interest me.

389
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,640
I played enough when I was a kid.

390
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,640
-Are your folks musicians?
-No, not at all.

391
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Our father died
when we were very young.

392
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

393
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,360
-This is where your friend lives?
-No. Just for a minute.

394
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,800
I have to see somebody.

395
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,000
No one was home. Let's go to Rodney's.

396
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Take that, it's my phone number,
in case you need it.

397
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,880
Which way should I go?

398
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,520
Straight.

399
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,520
-How are you doing?
-How are you doing?

400
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,840
-This is Joel.
-Hi.

401
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,920
How are you? Come on in.

402
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,720
Come and meet some people.
This is Eddie.

403
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,440
Fancy meeting you here.

404
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,320
Hi, Michael.

405
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,280
-How you doing? I'm Michael.
-Nice meeting you.

406
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,360
-This is Joel.
-Nice meeting you too.

407
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,600
You want something to drink?

408
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,320
Yeah. Coke.

409
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,200
Me too.

410
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,440
How are you?

411
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,160
I'm okay.
Other than my knee, everything is great.

412
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,320
I tried to call you last week,
but I guess you weren't home.

413
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,040
Yeah, right.

414
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,720
We're out of here.
It was nice meeting you all.

415
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,840
Bye, Michael.

416
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,320
-Bye.
-Bye.

417
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,840
Thanks.

418
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,440
Thank you.

419
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,240
I'm sorry. They surprised me.
I didn't know they were coming.

420
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,240
How long they've been together?

421
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,560
I don't know,
but I don't think it's anything serious.

422
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,400
She used to be my girlfriend.

423
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,400
By the way, man, happy birthday.

424
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,880
What are you drinking?
You want a vodka?

425
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,680
Oh, no, no, no, I don't drink.

426
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,560
I'll have orange juice if it's okay.

427
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,520
Orange juice? Have a beer.
We're celebrating.

428
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,160
Okay.

429
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,560
But in a small glass, please.

430
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,960
By the way, I hear
you're a walking basketball encyclopedia.

431
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,240
You can just ask him anything.
See for yourself.

432
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,360
Okay. Who are the starting five
for the Boston Celtics?

433
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,080
Wait. What are you talking about?
Boston starting five?

434
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,440
Ask him a real question.

435
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,400
Okay, I got a good one. Give me
the names of the rookies of the year...

436
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,880
...in 1961, '62, '63, and '64.

437
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,480
I'll give you a hint. All four played
for the American Olympic team...

438
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,720
...in Rome in 1960.

439
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,320
Okay.

440
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,560
We start with Oscar Robertson.

441
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,760
He played for Cincinnati
and was awarded rookie of the year.

442
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,280
Walt Bellamy played for Chicago...

443
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,960
...Terry Dischinger, also from Chicago...

444
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,960
...and Jerry Lucas.

445
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
He played for Cincinnati at that time.

446
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,200
You're sick, man. You're a sick man.

447
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,320
-That stuff was before you were born.
-Wait, I don't understand.

448
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,800
How did you know
to even ask that question?

449
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,440
I read it yesterday
in an old Sporting News.

450
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,520
-Hey, how is it going?
-How are you?

451
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,640
-I'm with a couple of guests, see you later.
-All right.

452
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,480
That guy is an agent.

453
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,600
American ballplayers come in here
after games.

454
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,440
Yeah. I already feel
like I'm in the middle of New York.

455
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,800
-It's still early.
-You ever been to New York?

456
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,120
No, no. I never been to America.

457
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,320
I have to make a phone call.
Where is the phone?

458
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,120
Right around the corner. Over there.

459
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,080
Okay, thank you.

460
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,720
So you think
Eddie and Segal will show up here?

461
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,600
They might.

462
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,040
So how is the team?

463
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,400
The team is okay. The guys are okay,
but the coach is killing me.

464
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,920
-It takes all the fun out of playing.
-Are they paying you on time?

465
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,160
They were, until now.
This month they were late.

466
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,400
And another vodka.

467
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,640
Are you trying to kill yourself?

468
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,480
Thank you.

469
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,160
One for him too.

470
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,760
I told my sister we are here.

471
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,280
-What's this, vodka?
-Yeah.

472
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,560
Oh, no, no, thank you.

473
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,640
-Come on, have one.
-It won't be good for me.

474
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,560
Just try it. Come on, it's not gonna kill you,
believe me.

475
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,360
You want us to be friends, don't you?

476
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,640
All right.

477
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,240
Have a beer, it helps.

478
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,760
That was too strong.

479
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,600
Wait a little bit before the next one.

480
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,680
You all right?

481
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,320
You look a little pale. Why won't you
go outside and get some fresh air?

482
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,120
-So you have a reporter of your own?
-Yeah. He's a good guy, though.

483
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,280
-He's lonely, you know?
-Who?

484
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,480
Hello!
Hello!

485
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,440
Joel. Joel. Hey, hey, hey.
What's the matter? Joel?

486
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,600
-Don't touch him.
-Take it easy.

487
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,720
What's wrong with him?

488
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,440
He's an epileptic, didn't you know?

489
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,400
You gave him alcohol, you idiot?

490
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
I didn't know.

491
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,520
Down! Down!

492
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,280
-Look at this Michael....
-What do you want? He's injured.

493
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,520
-Who's injured?
-Aren't you listening?

494
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,440
-Oren!
-Look at him...

495
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,840
-...trying to save the motherland.
-What is he doing? Back to defense!

496
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,960
Go back to defense and start guarding!

497
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,640
-Goddamn it. You can't pass the ball?
-Shut up.

498
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,800
Come on, you jackasses.

499
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,400
Okay, boys. Look, You know we have
some money problems this month.

500
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,360
I want you to know that you don't get
the money not because you're losing.

501
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,040
But I also want you to know things
will probably be fixed tomorrow.

502
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,880
That is all.

503
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,040
Wait, wait a minute, Amnon,
what's the deal with the money?

504
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,720
It's already been a month
and a half and I just--

505
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,960
Don't worry,
everything will be all right, trust me.

506
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,680
Oh, Michael...

507
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,920
...how's my English?

508
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,400
Your English?

509
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,680
Financially, the farmers have to spend
a lot of money for the irrigation waters...

510
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,880
...which was not planned this season.

511
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,840
The Drought Damages Fund will
compensate them for their losses...

512
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,680
...but there will be
no profits this year.

513
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,120
Excuse me, I am the son of your neighbor,
Mr. Kaufman.

514
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,920
We need another man for the prayer.

515
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,800
You see, we are only nine
and we need 10.

516
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,240
It's for my mother. She died.

517
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,120
...during your lifetime and your days
and the lifetime of the House Of Israel...

518
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,800
...speedily and very soon, and say Amen.

519
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,480
May his great name be blessed forever
and to all eternity.

520
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,800
May there be peace, life, satisfaction,
help, comfort, refuge, healing...

521
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,680
...redemption,
forgiveness, atonement...

522
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,480
relief and salvation for us and for
all his people Israel and say Amen.

523
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,400
May He who makes peace in His
high places grant peace for us...

524
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,440
-...and for all Israel and say Amen.
-Amen.

525
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,640
Thank you very much.

526
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,840
Michael!

527
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,440
Michael!

528
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
-Hi.
-Come with us, we will drink.

529
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,160
-We will laugh a little.
-No, thanks.

530
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,160
Take him to the sea, loosen him up, show
him the town, he looks completely down.

531
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,280
Thanks, you guys, but I'm kind of tired.

532
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,480
You're tired. You only go with him.
He makes everybody tired.

533
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,480
They're assholes.

534
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,480
No, they're not assholes.

535
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,920
That's what they are like.

536
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,320
Come to Israel for a visit.

537
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,720
Tell me, do you wanna come over
for dinner?

538
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,360
My mom's a great cook.

539
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,160
How do you like our city?

540
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,720
Well, I like it here, it's nice. Quiet.

541
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,880
-Have you ever visited anywhere else?
-Oh, yeah, sure.

542
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,840
Michael's been in Israel for two years.

543
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,680
Well, what do you know?
Where have you been?

544
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,760
Let me see.
I've been almost everywhere.

545
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,320
To Galilee, Eilat, Ein Gedi...

546
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,320
...Caesarea, Jerusalem,
I'm going there again tomorrow.

547
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,560
I think he's been in more places
in Israel than I have.

548
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
That's not so hard.

549
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,920
-Where's Rachel?
-Went to Tal Aviv

550
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,640
-She's in rehearsals. Thanks.
-Glad you enjoyed it.

551
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,800
Thanks.

552
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,600
-Welcome.
-I'd like to do some more traveling.

553
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,680
I got all this time on my hands
and I figure why not?

554
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,960
-Do you have a map of Israel?
-No, he doesn't

555
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,520
He has one of Los Angeles.

556
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,040
What, didn't you know?
He's an American citizen.

557
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,520
I have a map and I'll be happy
to give it to you.

558
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,800
But only on the condition that you take
this lazy fellow with you.

559
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,240
Let him see his own country for once.

560
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,160
Are you going to Jerusalem? Take him.

561
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,160
I'll bet he's never even
seen the Western world.

562
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,640
Have you ever seen a Jew...

563
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,360
...who hasn't been
to the Western world?

564
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,280
I'll be right back.
I'm going to bring the map.

565
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,560
-No, no, it's not urgent.
-No, no, it's okay. He lives here.

566
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,440
Right next door.

567
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,920
-He really takes care of you.
-Yeah, he takes care of all of us.

568
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,080
He more or less
raised me and my sister.

569
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,360
So, what, you're gonna do it here,
in Jerusalem?

570
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,480
Why not? I mean, I'll be here, I'll be in bed
for two days and I go home.

571
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,600
I'll tell you, this operation's a breeze.
There's nothing to it.

572
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,400
Oren and Avi will play inside.

573
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,440
Guy can play the shooting guard
and you play point guard.

574
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,920
Sorry. Thanks.

575
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,920
Michael.

576
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,440
Look, Sleepy Floyd,
Doc Rivers, Harper...

577
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,680
...they were all second guards
in college...

578
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,920
...and today they are the playmakers.

579
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,960
I'm telling you, it's not a new idea,
even in Israel.

580
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,480
Guy Goodes
runs plays sometimes.

581
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,920
Listen, Michael,
we have to do something.

582
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,680
Not only we're not gonna move
to the national league, okay...

583
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,600
...but we may end up moving down.

584
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,040
Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

585
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,520
You have a pen and paper?

586
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,160
Yes.

587
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,200
Of course.

588
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,120
Do you think...

589
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,800
...if I write something...

590
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,120
-...he will read it?
-I hope so.

591
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,400
But there is already
an awfully long line here.

592
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,760
Everyone's before you.

593
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,400
You know what?

594
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,560
So what did you write in your note?

595
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:57,600
No, you're not allowed to tell.
It's between you and him.

596
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,040
So what did you write?

597
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,920
I asked...

598
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,040
...for my knee to be okay,
for the operation to succeed.

599
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,840
I asked for my family to be healthy.

600
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,440
That was the first thing
I asked for.

601
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,840
And I asked for a family of my own.

602
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,760
You know, a nice, happy family.

603
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,160
I asked first for the team to succeed.

604
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,920
I mean, not to go down a league,
and next year, to go up.

605
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,880
If you're religious...

606
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,000
...I mean if you really, really
believed in God...

607
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,800
...would you ask him
to make you better?

608
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,600
I'll never be better, with or without God.

609
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,000
Block his back!

610
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,760
-What an ass.
-Guys, you're not playing.

611
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,840
You're just not playing. Shame on you.

612
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,320
Give him the ball! Give it to him!

613
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,600
Do you even understand
the mess we're in?

614
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,760
I have a feeling you're
not getting what I'm talking about.

615
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,560
Rebound. Rebound.

616
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,200
They're so useless!

617
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,480
-We'll drop a league if we keep this up.
-What about the money?

618
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,360
Get away from here, not now.

619
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,240
-I've been broke for two months now.
-I don't care.

620
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,280
Look, all of you can stop coming
to play if you want.

621
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,400
But as long as you're coming to play,
I want all the rest of your problems...

622
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:20,000
...including the financial ones, to stay
at home. Do you understand? Do you?

623
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,120
Yeah?

624
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,520
It's okay.

625
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,080
What?

626
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,360
How do you know?

627
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,520
Was he fired or did he quit?

628
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,920
All right.

629
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,960
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

630
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,080
Why tell me he's not here?
Tell me he's busy.

631
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,480
Tell me he's on the phone,
but don't tell me he's not here!

632
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,040
-I told you but you--
-You did not! You said he wasn't here.

633
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,840
In one month. You don't want to?
Then sue me.

634
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,680
You can see for yourself,
he has many problems now.

635
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,600
And I'm telling you,
he won't have time for you.

636
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,320
Michael.

637
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,520
I didn't know you are waiting.
Come in, come in.

638
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,680
I want to be straight with you.

639
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,560
I already told you,
I don't understand basketball...

640
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,360
...but I thought that with you
and that idiot, Yige'al...

641
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,520
...things would work out
and we would win.

642
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,800
And people would come and we will do
something good for the city.

643
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,360
But it's not happening.

644
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,240
-So first of all, I fired the ingrate coach.
-I know.

645
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,280
-How did you know already?
-It doesn't matter.

646
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,000
I know, it's your reporter friend.
Be careful of him.

647
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,280
He asks many questions and stick
his nose where he is not wanted.

648
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,880
All right, let's just forget about that
for now. What happens next?

649
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,280
I need a coach now. Urgently.

650
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,000
So I thought that with all your experience
and understanding of basketball...

651
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,600
...maybe you could be the coach.

652
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,280
And when your leg gets better,
you could also play.

653
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,480
-No, no way.
-Why? If you don't mind telling me.

654
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,880
Because I'm not a coach.

655
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,240
I don't know how to coach
and I don't wanna coach.

656
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,520
I came here to play ball for a year,
to earn some money.

657
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,440
Listen, Michael. You're injured now...

658
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,520
...and you're not doing anything
except asking for money.

659
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,320
You're not doing anything but you want
everybody to run in circles around you.

660
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,960
Well, forget it, do you understand?
Forget it.

661
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,240
And don't come around here anymore.
There is nothing for you here.

662
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,880
And you're not gonna get your money
for another two months. I don't have it.

663
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,160
And just so you know, I don't care
if the team doesn't play at all.

664
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,840
I don't care if it falls apart.
It makes no difference.

665
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,280
I have enough troubles of my own.

666
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,880
You now what? I don't care either.

667
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,880
But you're gonna pay me
the money you owe me.

668
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,960
Hey, Michael!

669
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,120
There's no practice today.

670
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,440
What, nobody told you?

671
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,600
Nobody tells me anything.

672
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,920
No money. No money, no team.

673
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,840
-Nobody come.
-Hey, Michael.

674
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,480
Joel!

675
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,280
What are you doing here?

676
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,520
I came to see what was happening,
if there's any practice.

677
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,200
If anyone would come.

678
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,640
Listen...

679
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,720
...Amnon's in more trouble
than we thought.

680
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,920
I've just done a story
on the whole situation.

681
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,560
So if Amnon wasn't connected
with the team...

682
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,680
...then you wouldn't have written
the article?

683
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,200
Probably not.

684
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,320
Probably I wouldn't have bothered
to investigate...

685
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,320
...and then I wouldn't have known
anything about it either.

686
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,240
But he really is a crook.

687
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,720
People have lost their savings
and their homes because of him.

688
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,320
Do you ever think
of doing something else?

689
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,840
Like going back to your music, maybe?
Something like that.

690
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,680
Did you ever think
of doing something else?

691
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,240
Why don't you coach?

692
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,920
I'm a player, I'm not a coach.

693
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,960
Look...

694
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,840
...I came here to play ball
and I wanna play ball.

695
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,280
But if everything falls apart,
then I just go back to Schenectady.

696
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,080
That's life.

697
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,520
Listen, which NBA coach came from
Schenectady? I never asked you that.

698
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,000
I have no idea.
I can hardly say the name.

699
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,160
-How do say it? Sche--
-Schenectady.

700
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,720
I have no idea.

701
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,200
Pat Riley.

702
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,440
How could you not know that?

703
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,680
Hello?

704
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,080
Hey.

705
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,720
No, I was over at the neighbor's.

706
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,160
Sure. When do you want me to come?

707
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,400
Now? Why, what's wrong?

708
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,680
No, I was on my way to Tel Aviv
to see Rodney.

709
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,560
Okay, I'll be there in a minute. Bye-bye.

710
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,520
What's with your knee?

711
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,120
I go in for an operation,
probably next week.

712
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,440
And how soon would you be able
to play after the operation?

713
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,880
If everything goes okay,
about three weeks.

714
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,680
Okay. How much money
did you make this year?

715
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,160
I don't like talking about money.

716
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,360
But let's assume
you are making $40,000.

717
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,080
Okay, wait, I wanna understand
what's going on here?

718
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,240
Joel told me what's happening
with your team.

719
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,000
About Amnon, that crook,
and everything else.

720
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,680
Now, there is something
I want you to know.

721
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,720
Joel is like a son to me.

722
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,240
He is the son of my brother,
may God rest his soul.

723
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,200
And I would do everything for him.

724
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,440
But he lives for basketball.
What can I do?

725
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,040
I don't even know who those people are,
but he loves it.

726
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,760
So listen, Michael,
I'm going to take Amnon's place.

727
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,240
I want you to stay here
on the team, to coach.

728
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,480
One thing I hope...

729
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,040
...although we don't know
each other very well.

730
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,920
I hope that you don't think
I'm trying to cheat you...

731
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,560
...and that I'm very serious about all this.

732
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,400
Michael, meet my wife.

733
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,840
-Joel, your new coach.
-Nice to meet you.

734
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,280
Our family loves to hug each other.

735
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,160
Don't worry, I won't hug you.

736
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,000
-I'll go get something to drink.
-Okay.

737
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,760
I gotta go. I just wanna know
who's gonna take care--

738
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,480
Sit down.
Everything's being taken care of.

739
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,800
You have nothing to worry about.
Sit down, it's all right.

740
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,560
Invite Michael to your concert.

741
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,640
-I don't know if he's interested.
-He's interested. He's interested.

742
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,400
Joel.

743
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,720
Inside. Guy, go.

744
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,680
Back. Back.

745
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,480
-Go in, Go in. Double up!
-Good job, Joel.

746
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,080
Go in.

747
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,600
-How you doing?
-How you doing?

748
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,440
Good. Hey, listen.
They moved up my operation.

749
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,000
If everything goes okay,
I'm gonna be back sooner.

750
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,000
-Well, that's great.
-Yeah, it's fantastic.

751
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,800
Hey, you put that in your paper.
It's your first scoop.

752
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,720
I've left the paper.

753
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,360
-What?
-I don't write for them anymore.

754
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,080
-When did that happen?
-This morning.

755
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,400
I don't get along with my boss anyway.

756
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,240
And besides, I don't think
it would be right for me...

757
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,800
...to keep writing about the team
when my uncle is the manager.

758
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,840
Basically I'm the one in charge now,
so don't laugh at your boss.

759
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,760
Okay. All right, if you're the boss,
you sit here...

760
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,080
...and don't move.
We're in this thing together.

761
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,320
It means you can nag me all you want.

762
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,520
-Hi. How you doing?
-Hey. Good.

763
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,440
-Hello, Michael.
-Hello. Good to see you. Hi.

764
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,480
You see, that's how you should dress.

765
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,400
I thought, what the hell, it's a concert.
First time I've worn a suit.

766
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,120
Don't pay any attention, Michael.
You look very handsome.

767
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,640
-Thank you.
-Very handsome.

768
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,760
-Thank you.
-Let's go. Let's go.

769
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,120
-What happened?
-I had an operation.

770
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,680
It's not as bad as it looks.

771
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,320
Come in.

772
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,240
I really wanted to hear this piece again.

773
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,360
I haven't listened to the music
since Rifka's been gone.

774
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,080
You know, we used to sit and listen.

775
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:17,520
-I-- If you don't wanna listen, I just--
-No, no, no. It's okay. It's perfectly okay.

776
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,720
I even thank you for coming.

777
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,080
Otherwise,
I might not have the courage.

778
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,160
It's good when two people
enjoy the same things.

779
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,200
But that didn't work that way
with our son.

780
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,920
He played a little piano then stopped.

781
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,840
And how was he? Could he play?

782
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,480
He was not a big talent.

783
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:44,040
But your friend, Joel, who studied
with my son, he was talented.

784
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,400
Very talented.

785
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:51,360
It's a crime that he stopped playing
because he could go very far.

786
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,600
Do you know why he stopped?

787
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,080
I have no idea.

788
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,720
I understand you met with Mr. Levi,
so you all know what happened.

789
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,840
Officially I'm the coach.

790
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,160
But as far as I'm concerned, Rammie's
the coach. And that goes for you guys too.

791
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,600
We have five games left.
We have to win three...

792
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,320
-...in order to stay in the league.
-Two won't be enough?

793
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,360
No, I wanna win three to make sure.
I want this team to stay in the league.

794
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,160
And we have a good manager now
who believes in us...

795
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,200
...and I don't wanna let him down,
all right?

796
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,400
Let's go right here.
Have a good practice.

797
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,360
-On three. One, two, three.
-Ashdod.

798
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,200
I'm telling you, if they hadn't given him that
fifth foul, we could have won this game.

799
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,360
What a terrible game.

800
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,040
Now I'm not sure that we can win the two
that are really necessary.

801
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,640
-How is your leg?
-Good. I'm gonna give it another day's rest...

802
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,600
...and then I'll go to the training room
day after tomorrow.

803
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,120
Michael, tell me the truth.

804
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,720
Do you think we can win
the rest of our games?

805
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,240
I don't know. I hope so.

806
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:04,040
Joel,
why did you stop playing the piano?

807
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,080
I was sick of it and it bored me.

808
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:11,440
And besides,
I was already the best one in town.

809
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,160
That's what I heard.

810
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,920
Both sides.

811
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,080
Defense.

812
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:32,200
-Defense, defense, quickly!
-Take it, take it.

813
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,400
Hands!

814
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,920
Defense! Defense!

815
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,200
Give it to Danny!

816
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,240
It's a foul!

817
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,440
What's this?

818
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,720
-Did you see that?
-He was right. It was an offensive foul.

819
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,040
Rammie. Rammie, come here.

820
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,200
Tell Danny to post up his man.
It worked once, keep doing it.

821
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,840
If that's not there, get the ball
to Oren in the high post, all right?

822
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,480
-Danny. Danny.
-I have no idea what you just said.

823
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,720
That's exactly the trouble
with you people.

824
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,440
Nobody who manages basketball
around here understands the game.

825
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,360
I'm telling you, if we go down a league,
the whole thing will fall apart.

826
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,560
We'll never even be able to think
about moving to the national league.

827
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,200
That's why I behave like this.

828
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,040
You're the manager now, right?

829
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:46,040
Make sure I have a free court tomorrow
morning. I wanna start shooting baskets.

830
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:50,240
-No problem.
-Michael, come here for a moment.

831
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,120
-Michael, you're an American, right?
-Right.

832
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,520
And you know what an employee
and employer are, right?

833
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,640
Okay, I want to tell you that if anyone
had talked to me the way you did...

834
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,600
...during the game...

835
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,880
...I would have thrown him out on his ear.

836
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,200
But in your case,
I'll talk to you in your own language.

837
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,560
So listen, Michael.

838
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,520
I'm the boss. Is that clear?

839
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:31,400
-You're absolutely right. I'm sorry.
-Okay.

840
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,520
I'm not going to sit next to you
on the bench anymore.

841
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,640
Only Joel will sit next to you.

842
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,160
Because maybe I don't understand
anything about basketball...

843
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,600
...but I understand business.

844
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,080
And I'm going to make good business
out of this team.

845
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,280
So from now on, you have
to be more involved in each game.

846
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:52,080
You won't just sit on the bench
and make comments from time to time.

847
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,800
You're going to start working.

848
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,040
You're the only one
who can keep the team in the league.

849
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,560
How's your knee?

850
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,600
It's okay.
It'll be a hundred percent by next week.

851
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,520
Okay. Go on back to Joel now.

852
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,200
I like you, Michael, you know?

853
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,440
Even though you were a schmuck.

854
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,240
Throw the ball right here.

855
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,560
Hey.

856
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,160
History's made. Rachel
in the basketball gym.

857
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,240
Go on. Don't mind me.

858
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,920
-Watch. I'm gonna make 10 out of 10.
-Bullshit.

859
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,760
Just toss me the rebounds.
You'll see. You wanna bet?

860
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,160
Make any bet.
There's no way you can do it.

861
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,320
Even though your shot's
looking pretty good.

862
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,880
My shot always looks good.

863
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,840
This is ridiculous.
This three-point line's way too close.

864
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,680
Here's what we'll do.
I'm gonna shoot 10 shots.

865
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,080
If I make them, you're gonna play
the piano for me, all right?

866
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,960
If I don't, I forget this whole piano
business. Won't ask any more questions.

867
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,800
Okay, 10 out of 10.

868
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,160
-Sure.
-Okay, here we go.

869
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,040
Michael, thanks.

870
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,400
So what do you do here when you're
alone? Doesn't it drive you crazy?

871
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,000
What are you smiling about? I've been
here a week. I'm bored to death.

872
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,200
I know.
In the beginning I was so lonely...

873
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,960
...all I can think about
was going down to Tel Aviv.

874
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,240
Let's go there now.

875
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,280
I can't. I've got practice.

876
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,840
Besides, lately,
I've been lonelier there than here.

877
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,800
I mean, Tel Aviv is a big city.

878
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,200
I'm from Schenectady,
not Manhattan.

879
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,200
There, I hardly knew anybody.
I hung out with other Americans.

880
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,760
-But here--
-Michael.

881
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,520
Michael. Come here.

882
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,520
Just a minute.
I'll be there in a second.

883
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,720
Who's that?

884
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,760
The old manager. The one
before your uncle. I can't stand him.

885
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:11,040
Somebody called me that way,
I'd turn a table over on him.

886
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,880
All of a sudden
you don't have time for me.

887
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,760
You used to run after me like a dog.

888
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,520
-Who do you think you are?
-Be quiet.

889
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,720
-Don't tell me to shut up.
-Shut the hell up.

890
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,560
Enough. You and I have nothing to say
to each other. Leave.

891
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,520
Why?
Who the hell are you, piece of shit?

892
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,800
An old American basketball player,
you're nothing. Zero.

893
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:36,000
Nobody's gonna help you.
Not even that bitch's uncle with her sick--

894
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,120
-Michael.
-Come on. What you gonna do?

895
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,360
Leave him alone!

896
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,680
-You'll be hearing from me.
-Fuck you.

897
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,280
What are you doing?

898
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,880
I have practice with the team now.

899
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,920
Why are you standing? Sit down.
You're tall enough as it is.

900
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,800
I have practice.

901
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,360
Okay, okay. When?

902
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,880
-An hour and a half.
-So?

903
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,760
I need to get there early so I could shoot
around. I gotta get back in shape.

904
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,440
So why did you ask me over?

905
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,240
I didn't ask you over.
You came on your own.

906
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,720
You knew I had practice.

907
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,400
You're quite a guy, you know that?

908
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,360
What happened to you?
I thought you were gonna come by.

909
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,760
I'm sorry, I stayed at home.
I was really tired.

910
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,720
Listen, Joel....

911
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,120
Do you mind if I go out with Rachel?

912
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,080
Tell me the truth.

913
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:05,280
You already went out with her,
didn't you?

914
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,960
But why should I mind?

915
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,040
She's a great girl.

916
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,560
I'd go out with her too.

917
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,840
I had a dream about her last night.

918
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,760
Strange dream, I didn't understand it.

919
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,760
She was trying to talk to Mr. Kaufman.

920
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:29,880
They were at some kind of
a demonstration, with signs and everything.

921
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:34,040
And also the picture changed.

922
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:37,440
And I saw myself trying to get
to the airport.

923
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,760
But when I got there, they said that
there are no more flights to America.

924
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:45,240
They'd all been canceled forever.

925
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,040
Do you dream a lot?

926
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,560
Especially lately.

927
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,880
Hand me the towel, will you?

928
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,240
Hey, that's a great T-shirt.

929
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,040
You like it?

930
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:12,000
You can have it. I got another one.

931
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,040
Thanks.

932
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,440
Play.

933
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,680
Look for it.

934
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,040
Yeah, good job. Good job.
Get back. Get back.

935
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,160
Get back. Get back.
Come on, guys. Let's go.

936
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,880
Great. The band, these people.
Where did they come from?

937
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,000
We let the kids in for free.

938
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,880
Rebound. Rebound.

939
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,440
Come on, guys. Let's go.

940
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,880
Run it. Run it. Run it.

941
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,720
-Yeah.
-All right.

942
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,200
Play calm, calm.

943
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,480
Come on, guys. Let's go.

944
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,640
Run it. Run it. Run it.

945
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,520
Rebound.

946
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,840
-Defense. Come on, guys.
-All right.

947
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,240
All right, let's go. Come on.
Come on. Let's go.

948
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,840
Give it to him. That's how you pass?

949
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,600
-Enough with the sunflower seeds.
-What's your problem?

950
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,520
When are you going in?

951
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,920
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
It'll be all right. It's all right.

952
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,680
Foul!

953
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,920
Foul!

954
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,480
Come on. Come on. Defense.
Let's go, fellows. Let's go.

955
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,840
-Defense.
-That's it. That's it. Defense.

956
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,320
Block, block.

957
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,920
They need timeout.

958
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,280
Okay. Timeout.

959
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,880
Okay, we're gonna do the 1-3-1.

960
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:18,520
Michael will do the one-three-one,
you play left wing.

961
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,080
-Okay, let's go.
-Let's go. Let's go.

962
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:28,000
Michael! Michael! Michael!

963
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:32,720
Michael! Michael! Michael!

964
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,400
Hands, hands, hands!

965
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,280
Good, Michael.

966
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,840
Ashdodia cha-cha-cha
Ashdodia cha-cha-cha

967
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,640
Ashdodia cha-cha-cha
Ashdodia cha-cha-cha

968
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,000
Yeah, man!
All right.

969
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,040
All right.

970
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,680
I can't believe it. You were great.

971
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,480
Okay. Everybody in.

972
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:56,200
Joel, make sure the door--
Don't let anybody in, all right. Sit down.

973
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,640
Listen up. Listen up. All right, that's it.

974
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,880
This is the first of three.
We got two more.

975
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,960
An away game on Thursday,
an easy one.

976
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,760
Monday night, we got a tough one.
All right, a home game.

977
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,040
Keep it shut just for a second.
Keep it shut.

978
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,280
I hope you feel the same way.

979
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,920
We've got to win this for our new
management. Right?

980
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,680
-All right.
-That's great.

981
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:22,320
Joel, open the door. Open the door.

982
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,520
Have you gone insane?

983
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,720
Rachel likes you.
And you know, she's a pretty big snob.

984
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,440
And usually, she hates athletes.

985
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,320
Yeah, I know.

986
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,840
But she's nice and she's straight too,
you know.

987
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,400
Yes, she's very straight.

988
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,200
How come you never come
to New York?

989
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,560
What would I do there?

990
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,560
Just sit around and be bored.

991
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,320
You know what?

992
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,080
You should come home
with me this summer.

993
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,960
Why not? You're making
good money now. It'll be fun.

994
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,960
There's a good summer league.
You could see some great basketball.

995
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,680
Are you serious?

996
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,120
Yeah, I'm serious. My folks have
a house, there's plenty of room.

997
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:11,000
You should come.
It'll be fun, I'm telling you.

998
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:17,480
Listen, Michael, are you serious
or are you just talking?

999
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,680
Yeah, I'm serious. I said I was,
didn't I? What's wrong with you?

1000
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,560
All right. All right.
Here, this way. This way.

1001
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,320
Good, Michael.

1002
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,200
-Foul. Give him a foul.
-Foul.

1003
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,000
Michael, get back. Michael.

1004
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,600
This American bastard.

1005
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,120
He was never worth anything,
and he'll never be worth anything.

1006
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,160
Michael. Michael. Michael.

1007
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,960
Timeout.

1008
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,760
Come in.

1009
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,640
Shit.

1010
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,560
Damn it.

1011
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,960
Premier league, premier league,
premier league

1012
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:05,520
The final game is on Monday. If the
other team wins they move up a league.

1013
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:08,000
Don't worry, it's gonna be all right.

1014
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,280
How is it gonna be all right?

1015
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,120
You're telling me not to worry?
We lost a game we should've won.

1016
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,160
Michael.

1017
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,360
I'm sorry.

1018
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,920
I don't know what to say.

1019
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,400
I don't think I've ever played so badly.

1020
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,200
This has really screwed us up.

1021
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,480
Michael...

1022
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,840
...I've already told you
that I don't understand basketball...

1023
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,160
...but I know what I saw.

1024
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,920
I know. I know and I'm sorry.

1025
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,800
Why are you so sorry all the time?

1026
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,120
What I saw
was an American ballplayer...

1027
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:08,160
...breaking his back in order to beat
a half-ass team from some hole in Israel.

1028
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,440
That's what I saw.

1029
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,480
-I really did--
-And that's what matters to me.

1030
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Now tell me, is your contract
only for this year?

1031
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,800
Yeah, I'm going home next year.

1032
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,200
You're not going anywhere.
You're staying here...

1033
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,080
...for another year, maybe two.

1034
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,800
You are going to help me
and Joel to build a new team.

1035
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:31,520
Afterwards, you can go back to the
States with a lot of money. Understand?

1036
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,840
And we are not going down
a league.

1037
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,120
It's gonna be tough.

1038
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,480
We are not going down a league.

1039
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,040
I really admire the way you eat.

1040
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:49,800
I always eat a lot, especially
after we lose a game and I'm upset.

1041
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,960
My whole family likes to eat.

1042
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,360
You should see my brother and father.
Joel will tell you about them.

1043
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,480
You know, he doesn't stop talking
about this trip.

1044
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,000
It's funny because he hasn't
even mentioned it to me.

1045
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,400
What can I say, he talks about it
with us all the time.

1046
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,080
How was the concert?

1047
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,960
Pretty good.

1048
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,160
I think I played well
and I felt good about it.

1049
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,960
You look very pretty tonight.

1050
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,440
Thank you.

1051
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,080
You must have felt lonely
all of a sudden.

1052
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:34,040
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
Thanks for coming.

1053
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,000
So why did you play so hard to get?

1054
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,720
I still am.

1055
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,640
Why? Because of Joel?

1056
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,920
Partly, yeah.

1057
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,640
I don't think it's a good idea
to date a friend's sister.

1058
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,240
-And Joel is--
-And what else?

1059
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,400
And what else?

1060
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,480
You're scary.

1061
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,960
Me?

1062
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,280
Why?

1063
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:27,360
So you screwed me, you got dressed
and now you're ready to go?

1064
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,280
That's right.

1065
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:32,360
So tell me, Rachel...

1066
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,520
...why did you change your mind
after hating me?

1067
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:39,160
I didn't hate you. Don't exaggerate.
I was angry at you.

1068
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,960
But I think once I saw you at
the concert, you looked so handsome...

1069
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,560
...and so confused,
I decided I wanted you.

1070
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,440
You can't take a hint.
I thought there was something wrong.

1071
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,960
You always get what you want?

1072
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,760
No.

1073
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,240
I wish I did.

1074
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,320
But most of the time, I do.

1075
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,040
Anyway, you're the only basketball star
I've ever been with.

1076
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:16,320
Come on, I'm not a basketball star,
give me a break.

1077
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,520
Joel says you're a star,
where you were.

1078
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,800
Yeah, I was, maybe.

1079
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:26,320
Well, that's what's concerned him.
If it matters to him, it matters to me.

1080
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,960
What? That I'm a basketball player?

1081
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,800
What I want you to know...

1082
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:41,600
...is how much you matter to Joel.

1083
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,760
I don't think you understand that.

1084
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,560
I don't think you realize
how happy you make him.

1085
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,720
How much he's changed.

1086
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,600
The trip to America and everything.

1087
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,960
He always wanted a friend like you.

1088
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,960
A basketball player.

1089
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,360
Star athlete.

1090
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,400
And they always thought he was just
a pest. And he was.

1091
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,440
I don't know why. He's a great guy.

1092
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,800
He's really a great guy.

1093
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,800
And I love him...

1094
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,640
...more than anything.

1095
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:31,160
Big Oren, and then Michael...

1096
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,520
-...he needs to throw--
-Enough! Sit down, you talk too much.

1097
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,120
I can't believe
it's the last game tomorrow.

1098
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,480
Tell me, are you nervous?

1099
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,600
Not really. I will be tomorrow
before the game. What about you?

1100
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,400
I can't hardly stand it.

1101
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,280
You don't know what's happening.
The whole city is on edge.

1102
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,200
Yes.

1103
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,800
Down, quickly! Defense! Defense!

1104
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,640
Block him!

1105
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,680
Great! Great!

1106
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:28,760
Three seconds! Three seconds!

1107
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,000
Throw!

1108
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,600
Take a time-out, Rammie.

1109
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,720
Okay, okay

1110
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,160
Go at him!

1111
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,440
Don't worry, it's gonna be all right.

1112
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,280
What are you doing?

1113
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,600
Take it. Drugs.

1114
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,440
Second pick. Second pick.

1115
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,760
Foul. Foul.

1116
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,720
Foul, that's a foul.

1117
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:29,080
Guys, lift your heads up, get into
the game, we're 8 points behind.

1118
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,360
Rammie. Rammie, Rammie, hold on
just a second. Can I? Do you mind?

1119
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,120
Go ahead.

1120
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,800
All right, listen up, guys, look at me.

1121
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,360
Matti. Matti, hey. Look at me.

1122
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,800
We have 20 minutes left.
Twenty minutes, that's it.

1123
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,720
These guys are playing rough.
The refs are letting them get away with it.

1124
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,760
Well, goddamn it, we play rough too.

1125
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,200
The big guy's pushing you all over.
Fuck that.

1126
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,320
He pushes you, you push him.
You don't take that shit.

1127
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,120
Don't do anything fancy.
Keep it simple.

1128
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,680
Basic basketball:
you pass, set a pick.

1129
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:01,960
Pass, set a pick, that's it.

1130
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,520
Just basic basketball. Simple.

1131
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,640
Simple. Simple. Simple.

1132
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,000
Let's remember
where we're coming from, fellows.

1133
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:14,000
Remember your pride.

1134
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,640
Let's kick some ass.

1135
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,880
-All right.
-All right. Let's go.

1136
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,920
-On three. One, two, three.
-Ashdod.

1137
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,320
Matti!

1138
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,760
Open it up, open it up!

1139
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,760
Time out!

1140
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,320
Foul. Foul.

1141
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,320
-Who will fuck you, you faggot?
-Watch your mouth!

1142
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,240
Take him out!

1143
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,440
Time out! Time out!

1144
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,800
Play ball, fucking asshole.

1145
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,600
Michael, are you okay?

1146
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,120
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1147
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,680
It's not basketball we're playing.

1148
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,560
Two throws.

1149
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,320
You hear me?

1150
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,280
Foul!

1151
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:26,200
Defense!

1152
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,760
That's right. Play two. Start.

1153
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,240
We're gonna start pressing right now.

1154
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,360
We're gonna press full court
and play hard.

1155
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,040
Play hard and look for Michael.

1156
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,360
Look for Michael.

1157
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,360
-All right.
-We got it, men.

1158
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,640
-Let's go.
-All right.

1159
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,000
-One, two, three.
-Ashdod.

1160
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,160
-Simchah, hey, where's Joel?
-I don't know. He's not here.

1161
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,600
I can see that.
Do me a favor. Go look for him.

1162
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:15,920
What are you doing here? Come on.

1163
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,000
I don't wanna. I can't watch this game.

1164
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,440
-What do you mean? It's a great game.
-Are you crazy?

1165
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,480
They're ripping us to shreds.
Look how my heart's beating fast.

1166
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,120
So what? Mine is too. Touch it.

1167
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,520
Come on. Michael took a time-out
so I can bring you.

1168
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:34,520
-When? Now?
-No, two years ago. Yeah, now.

1169
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:47,760
Ashdodia! Ashdodia! Ashdodia!

1170
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:55,440
Hard defense! Hard defense!

1171
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,240
Good, Michael, good!

1172
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,920
Good!

1173
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,680
Where were you?
Michael is having the game of his life.

1174
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,360
Ashdodia
Ashdodia

1175
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:13,000
Dodanny, control him.

1176
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,120
What's this?

1177
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,000
-Are you all right?
-I'm okay.

1178
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,160
Guys, he's all right.

1179
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,600
Technical foul.

1180
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:42,840
Michael! Michael! Michael!

1181
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,240
Michael! Michael! Michael!

1182
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,320
Ball.

1183
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,600
Defense! Quickly!

1184
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,280
Rebound, rebound, rebound.

1185
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,880
Seven seconds.

1186
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,600
We won!

1187
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,720
Yes!

1188
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,760
What's wrong with you?

1189
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,760
Come on. Everyone's in the living room.

1190
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,640
I'll be there in a second.
Let me finish eating, okay?

1191
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,080
I just wanna be alone for a minute.

1192
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,960
Hey, two more weeks
and we're out of here.

1193
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,040
I spoke to my mother.
We'll get there for my brother's wedding.

1194
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,560
-Wedding? Who's getting married?
-His brother.

1195
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,800
-What are you doing in here?
-He wants to be alone.

1196
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,440
How's the leg?

1197
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,320
It hurts.

1198
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,880
When are you gonna come visit me
in America?

1199
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,480
Whenever you say.

1200
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,720
What do you mean visit?
I live there now.

1201
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:36,160
Look, look at it.

1202
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,080
Michael, Michael, come on.
We're having a toast for next year.

1203
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,240
Okay, Joel.
Just give me a minute, okay?

1204
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,520
Give him a minute
See, he wants to be alone.

1205
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,440
He had a thousand people
around him.

1206
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,840
Yeah, so did I.
And I want to be alone too.

1207
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,800
Don't say anything.

1208
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,880
Now come.

1209
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:17,440
He's been working on it every day
for a month.

1210
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:18,840
Come on.

1211
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,600
Are you all right?

1212
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:59,960
Don't touch him.

1213
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:03,080
Mother.
Mother.

1214
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,000
He's fine now.

1215
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:44,120
I'm hoping that he'll fall asleep
and that will be the end of it.

1216
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:47,120
You don't look so good yourself.

1217
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,800
I'm drunk.

1218
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,360
Well, you can go home now. He's okay.

1219
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,800
I want you to come home with me.

1220
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,440
Will you?

1221
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:58,400
Of course, I will. What did you think?

1222
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:03,720
Okay, I want to go talk
to Joel first.

1223
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,040
Okay.

1224
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,840
-I'm gonna go help my mother.
-Okay.

1225
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,920
Hey.

1226
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,240
How do you feel?

1227
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,600
I'm okay.

1228
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,440
So how did I play?

1229
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,000
That was beautiful.

1230
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,560
-I'm sorry, you know.
-What? What are you talking about?

1231
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,560
I shouldn't do it.
I know it would happen.

1232
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:40,600
You feel okay now?

1233
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:43,440
Yeah. I told you don't worry. I feel fine.

1234
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,840
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

1235
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,280
I'll let you get some sleep.

1236
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,920
Hey, Michael.

1237
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:56,320
Sit here for a minute.

1238
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:02,800
Listen.

1239
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:08,920
I wanted to tell you that
I'm not going with you.

1240
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,880
I can't.

1241
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,440
Why not?

1242
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,000
Because I'm afraid.

1243
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:18,200
I'm really afraid to be away from here.

1244
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:22,160
You know, I think, I always knew
I wouldn't go in the end.

1245
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,800
I really wanna stay here in Ashdod.

1246
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:29,280
This is the best place for me.

1247
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,080
Tell me,
are you going back with Rachel?

1248
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,640
I don't know.

1249
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,480
I hope so.

1250
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,520
I hope so too.

1251
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,400
Then maybe you'll come back here.

1252
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:46,080
No, Joel, I'm not coming back.

1253
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,640
I'm through playing basketball.

1254
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,200
You hear that, guys?

1255
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,920
That's it. You can relax.

1256
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,480
You know, these guys.

1257
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,520
They aren't just your dream.

1258
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,800
They were mine too.

1259
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,920
Will you send me
basketball magazines?

1260
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,680
I'll send you any damn thing you want.
