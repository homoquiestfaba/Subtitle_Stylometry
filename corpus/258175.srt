1
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:46,125
<i>I grew up in the northwest section</i>
<i>of Baltimore. It was all Jewish.</i>

2
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,893
<i>In fact, I didn 't even think of it</i>
<i>in those terms.</i>

3
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:50,924
<i>I just assumed everyone was Jewish.</i>

4
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:51,963
<i>Abrams.</i>

5
00:00:53,493 --> 00:00:55,404
<i>The whole world was Jewish.</i>

6
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:56,602
Ackerman.

7
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:59,088
<i>I remember when I was</i>
<i>in the second grade...</i>

8
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:02,524
<i>... the first clue that some people</i>
<i>were different occurred to me then.</i>

9
00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:06,249
Cohen.

10
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:09,492
Cohen.

11
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:12,126
Der.

12
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:16,130
<i>I even thought Ping Der was Jewish.</i>

13
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:20,087
<i>The "Ping" part didn 't sound Jewish,</i>
<i>but I assumed it was a nickname.</i>

14
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:24,526
<i>Her brother's name was Minhuey,</i>
<i>and that definitely sounded Jewish.</i>

15
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:28,011
<i>I sensed there was a world beyond</i>
<i>what I knew...</i>

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,283
<i>... when I had lunch at</i>
<i>Butch Johnson 's house.</i>

17
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:31,802
Something wrong, Ben?

18
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:36,211
No. This is fine.
I just never had raw bread before.

19
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:39,767
We always cook it.
You know, toast it.

20
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:40,889
I can do that.

21
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:44,364
There's too much white here.
The milk's white, the bread's white.

22
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:45,688
It's all white stuff.

23
00:01:45,893 --> 00:01:47,326
What do you normally have?

24
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,285
Not this.

25
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:50,812
<i>What was on the bread?</i>

26
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:54,045
Luncheon meat.
I've never heard of it.

27
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:56,813
Not bologna? Not salami?

28
00:01:57,093 --> 00:02:00,483
No, luncheon meat
with mayonnaise and milk.

29
00:02:00,693 --> 00:02:01,808
Everything was white.

30
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:04,852
Well, they must not be Jewish.

31
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,849
They're the other kind.

32
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:10,561
<i>A couple of years later,</i>
<i>I began to realize...</i>

33
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:14,004
<i>... that the other kind was</i>
<i>about 99o/o of the world.</i>

34
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:16,443
<i>I went to school thinking</i>
<i>everyone was Jewish.</i>

35
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:19,921
Now I know almost no one is Jewish.

36
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:22,249
The other kind.

37
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:26,692
<i>I was reminded of that revelation the</i>
<i>summer Murray, Sheldon and myself...</i>

38
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:29,202
<i>... went to the</i>
<i>Turkey Hills Swim Club.</i>

39
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:35,365
She's gotta be the most
beautiful girl on earth.

40
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:39,046
Look at those cigarettes. So sexy.

41
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:40,845
So sexy.

42
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:46,485
She's gotta be wild. If she's doing
that with a pack of cigarettes...

43
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:48,724
...she's gotta be wild.

44
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,363
- How'd they come up with that order?
- What?

45
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:08,410
That Jews should be first.

46
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:12,731
Yeah, I would've thought it'd be dogs,
coloreds, then Jews.

47
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:16,568
Must've been some meeting to come up
with that. Some guy had to say:

48
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:19,412
"I have to say, Jews bother me
more than the dogs."

49
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:22,764
<i>So now a dog goes there.</i>
<i>Does he read the sign and leave?</i>

50
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:24,287
<i>I would've put dogs first.</i>

51
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:27,366
A dog can take a piss.
You're walking barefoot.

52
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:30,485
A Jew's not gonna lift his leg
and pee on the wall.

53
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:34,368
You know, I've never seen a colored
person swim or sunbathe, period.

54
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:35,483
Did you?

55
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:39,327
Now that you mention it,
I don't think I have.

56
00:03:39,573 --> 00:03:43,122
I'm thinking Atlantic City.
That's a lot of people on that beach.

57
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,166
Never seen a colored on the beach.

58
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:47,967
This is definitely directed
more at the Jews then.

59
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:50,364
<i>The school year begins in one week...</i>

60
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:53,690
<i>... and all schools will implement</i>
<i>the new integration law.</i>

61
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:57,602
<i>Baltimore school district officials</i>
<i>do not anticipate any problems...</i>

62
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,292
<i>... implementing the new law.</i>

63
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:07,486
<i>Summer faded away.</i>

64
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:09,763
The "summer faded away" and what?

65
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:11,568
The end of summer.

66
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:13,809
<i>A composition</i>
<i>of what you did last summer.</i>

67
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:15,332
It's hard to read.

68
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:18,125
What's that word?

69
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:21,689
"Jewish."

70
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:24,846
<i>- "Jewish," I think.</i>
<i>- "Jewish"?</i>

71
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,970
I'll be back in a little while.

72
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:22,732
Like clockwork. If it's Rosh Hashanah,
Nate and Charlie must pay a visit.

73
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:24,770
What can I say? It's tradition.

74
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:27,481
The cantor sings, that's our cue
to see the new Caddy.

75
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:29,411
Pretty. Pretty in green.

76
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:31,126
They call it "mist green."

77
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:32,847
Is that what they call it?

78
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:35,288
I thought you'd look
at the convertible.

79
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:38,053
Ada keeps talking four doors,
convenience.

80
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:42,852
Carl Zeitsoff was in. I told him you
were coming to see the new Caddies.

81
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,812
6-9-9. He always bets
the same number.

82
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:48,123
For 10 years it is the same number.

83
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,972
It would've been a shock
if it was another number.

84
00:05:51,173 --> 00:05:52,606
Any price increase this year?

85
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:56,522
Let's look at the paperwork.
I haven't had a chance to look it over.

86
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,769
It just literally came in.

87
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:03,801
Get a haircut.

88
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:06,288
I'm letting it grow like Samson's.

89
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:08,768
How are the coloreds doing in school?

90
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:12,642
They're doing good. They're getting
better grades than I am.

91
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:13,808
Girl's attractive.

92
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:15,568
What?

93
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:17,647
She's attractive.

94
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:21,323
Just kill me now. Just kill me now.

95
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:22,768
What?

96
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:24,247
What do you mean?

97
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:26,162
Pretty.

98
00:06:26,373 --> 00:06:27,488
Oh, my God!

99
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:31,402
I said she was attractive.
That doesn't mean I'm attracted to her.

100
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:33,490
She's attractive.

101
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,369
Where's the jawbone of the ass?

102
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,084
The jawbone of the ass. Where is it?

103
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:42,763
Is he crazy?
What talk is this?

104
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:45,084
Your ass does not have a jawbone.

105
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,052
Samson fought the Philistines
with the jawbone of an ass.

106
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:51,962
- Not your ass. An animal.
- There's an animal called an "ass"?

107
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:53,731
Such a mouth.

108
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:56,812
Look, I loved <i>Samson and Delilah.</i>

109
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:58,805
I hope they bring that movie back.

110
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:01,962
"He slew hundreds with
the jawbone of an ass."

111
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,891
Do you believe this stuff?

112
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:05,323
I don't know.

113
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:07,410
What do you mean?
It's in the Bible.

114
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:08,682
That makes it true?

115
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:11,009
It's in the Bible. A story.

116
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:12,282
Yeah, a true story?

117
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:14,609
It's not the question if it's true.

118
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:17,407
If it's in the Bible,
it's for a reason.

119
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:18,443
What reason?

120
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:19,728
A good reason!

121
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:21,367
That's the reason?

122
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,724
It's there. He had long hair.
He was strong.

123
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:28,488
He knocked the building down.
He killed the <i>goyim.</i>

124
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:32,652
- Finish of the story.
- There weren't gentiles yet. Pagans.

125
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:37,369
Pagans, <i>schmagans,</i> gentiles.
Something, but not Jewish.

126
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,962
We know. If they're
not Jewish, they're...

127
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,806
...the other kind.

128
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:43,891
Go make yourselves busy.

129
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:48,291
Your father's not gonna be home for
almost an hour. Go watch television.

130
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:09,251
- They call it "mist green."
- I think it's "green mist."

131
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:13,527
Tell Louie to park the car in back.
We'll be coming out for dinner.

132
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:17,043
- Do Ada and the boys like it?
- Benny likes convertibles.

133
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:30,282
Can I help you?

134
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:33,810
I'm here to see the-the-the...

135
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,968
The physician.

136
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,171
- What's the thought?
- I don't know.

137
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,405
But burlesque is finished.

138
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:43,092
TV puts us in the shithouse.

139
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:45,602
How often can you watch
Milton Berle wear a dress?

140
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:48,765
There's a lot of good shows.
Did you see <i>Marty</i>?

141
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:51,693
"What do you wanna do, Marty?"
"What do you wanna do?"

142
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,210
What are you talking about?

143
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:57,291
Guy can't get a date.
He's shy. He's a butcher.

144
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:59,449
- Do I care?
- I thought you saw it.

145
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:03,612
"Ma, I'm an ugly man.
I'm a butcher. Nobody wants me."

146
00:09:03,813 --> 00:09:06,202
Don't you understand
the problem I've got?

147
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,483
I have to declare to the IRS
that I make more...

148
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,684
...with this burlesque house
than I do...

149
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:14,772
...to keep them off my ass, or they'll
start looking at what else I do.

150
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:18,010
Last time I looked, running
a numbers racket was illegal.

151
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:21,489
God forbid they look in the audience,
see how many people we have.

152
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:22,921
To be a realist...

153
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,488
...we've got two years
in this joint, tops.

154
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:28,844
So where are they...?
Where are you from?

155
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:33,722
Don't get personal.
Let me listen to your heart.

156
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:43,249
The new Caddy this year costs more.
Next year, more still.

157
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:46,365
Same dollars from our take
on the numbers is not good business.

158
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:48,484
Everybody, put on
your thinking caps...

159
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:51,002
...and figure how we can
raise the revenue.

160
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:52,646
I think we can do better.

161
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:55,686
Everybody's waiting for me
on a Rosh Hashanah dinner.

162
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:56,848
I got an idea.

163
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:59,613
Put on your thinking caps.
We don't need an answer now.

164
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:01,246
Nate, I got something good.

165
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:02,882
Make it quick.

166
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:05,601
We introduce a fourth digit
as a bonus number.

167
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:06,643
Double the pot.

168
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:08,127
How do you pay for it?

169
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,563
It's 10 percent of the original bet.

170
00:10:10,773 --> 00:10:14,243
<i>If it's 50 cents, it's an additional</i>
<i>5 cents; 60 cents, 6 cents...</i>

171
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:17,684
<i>... 70 cents, 7 cents;</i>
<i>a buck, 10 cents...</i>

172
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:31,328
If a person is a Communist
or a Socialist, what does that mean?

173
00:10:31,573 --> 00:10:34,167
If you're a Communist
and wanna blow up a building...

174
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:36,841
...or sell secrets to a spy,
that's different.

175
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:40,569
<i>But if you believe in different</i>
<i>economics, it should have no effect.</i>

176
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,209
- Period.
- Well, I can't write that.

177
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:44,892
I could. You just can't read it.

178
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:48,170
Such a sloppy writer. It won't look
good if you get older.

179
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,603
I have no idea what this has to do
with McCarthy.

180
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:52,849
McCarthy pushes
his ideals and beliefs...

181
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:55,812
...with intimidation,
and that is very dangerous.

182
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:57,487
What do I wear for Halloween?

183
00:10:57,693 --> 00:11:01,447
You always change the subject.
Why do you always go off on a tangent?

184
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:04,008
I'm thinking McCarthy, witch hunts...

185
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:06,602
...witches, Halloween.
What do I wear?

186
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:07,848
Go as a pirate.

187
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:10,772
See? Your grandmother has
the perfect solution.

188
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,530
<i>Yea, though I walk through</i>
<i>the valley of the shadow of death...</i>

189
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:21,529
...I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.

190
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:25,487
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

191
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:29,006
Thou preparest a table before me...

192
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:31,408
...in the presence of mine enemies.

193
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:34,926
Thou anointest my head with oil...

194
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,124
<i>You stuck on Sylvia?</i>

195
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,563
<i>I saw you eyeing her</i>
<i>during the 23rd Psalm.</i>

196
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:41,570
<i>I was watching her pray.</i>

197
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:44,652
She was really into it.

198
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:47,686
I mean, her head was bowed,
her eyes were closed.

199
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:50,043
She was really praying.

200
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,444
- Would you take her out?
- You kidding?

201
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:56,690
Not in public. You know,
on the sly or something.

202
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:59,487
Look, Sheldon,
I was watching her pray.

203
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:02,969
I was wondering what she was thinking.
I was curious.

204
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:05,368
You know, colored girls are
great with sex.

205
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:07,086
- That so?
- Proven fact.

206
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,842
- Where do you get your facts?
- I accumulate this information.

207
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:13,323
For one, colored guys
got huge <i>schlongs.</i>

208
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:15,564
Twice the size of a white guy's.

209
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:17,806
Where do you come up with this?

210
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:19,765
Unless you haven't noticed...

211
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:23,211
...we got a colored guy in our class.
Wilbert Mosley.

212
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:25,012
I took a shower with him.

213
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:28,649
Mine's all shriveled up
from the water. I got maybe an inch.

214
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:31,806
His is halfway down to his knees,
I swear to God.

215
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:32,963
Give me a break.

216
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:36,802
I swear to God, his knees. It was
giving me an inferiority complex.

217
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:39,647
So I'm thinking this
circumcision thing we have done...

218
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,361
...it's not just about clipping
innocent foreskin.

219
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:44,006
It's about stunting its growth.

220
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:45,282
You gotta be kidding.

221
00:12:45,493 --> 00:12:47,768
- I'm talking about Wilbert's <i>schlong.</i>
- Humongous.

222
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:49,332
He didn't believe me.

223
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:50,802
See that girl?

224
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:53,130
Wilbert could tap her from here.

225
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,603
It's tied to his leg
when it's not in use.

226
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:58,247
Good guy. Smart as shit.
Lets me cheat off him.

227
00:12:58,453 --> 00:12:59,886
Ben is taken with Sylvia.

228
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:01,651
Would you give it a rest?

229
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:04,362
- My parents would die.
- Your parents?

230
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:08,043
Her father's a big doctor
at Provident Hospital. Wealthy.

231
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:12,132
You're way too low-class. You try to
take her out, her father would flip.

232
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:13,808
Plus you're Jewish.

233
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:16,365
Give it 45 minutes.

234
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:18,609
You gotta take a shower with Wilbert.

235
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:20,611
You will be amazed.

236
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:22,728
You gotta be kidding.

237
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:35,132
See you later, Ma.

238
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:39,608
Ben's upstairs.

239
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:41,371
You're not getting dressed?

240
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:42,528
I'm a beatnik.

241
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:44,082
That's some outfit.

242
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:54,451
Ben, let's go!

243
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,369
You're gonna go as reindeers?

244
00:13:57,813 --> 00:13:59,610
- We're Vikings.
- Vikings?

245
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,206
They're from here?

246
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:05,805
Oh, my God.

247
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,965
Oh, my God! Ada! Oh, my God.

248
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:14,804
Have you lost your mind?

249
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:17,648
Have you completely lost your mind?

250
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:19,605
What do you mean?
It's Halloween.

251
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:22,566
There's something wrong with this boy.
He's a lunatic.

252
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:24,684
<i>Bubbe,</i> the war was over forever ago.

253
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,368
I can't breathe.

254
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:28,604
Where do you think you're going?

255
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:30,605
To a party. It's Halloween.

256
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:33,532
You are not leaving this house
dressed as Adolf Hitler!

257
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,610
It's Halloween. That's the joke.

258
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:39,010
Couldn't you have gone as a pirate?
Or a reindeer?

259
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:43,726
Take that off, or I call your father.
You are not going out of this house!

260
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:46,123
It took me forever
to get this costume.

261
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,928
I had to go to Sunny Surplus downtown
to get boots like these!

262
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,771
Adolf Hitler is in the hallway.

263
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:56,164
I'm calling your father now.
You are not going out.

264
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:57,852
What do you guys think?

265
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:00,891
It might be a tad too much.

266
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:08,610
If we got this new system worked out
with the numbers...

267
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:09,962
...we should start.

268
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:14,132
It's the end of October. We should go
with it second week in November.

269
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,052
Let me see if we can
nail down a date.

270
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:19,483
Gaiety.

271
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:21,804
Pete, put Nate on the phone.

272
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:32,245
He looks like Adolf Hitler?

273
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,246
He can stay in the house all night.
He's not going out dressed as Hitler.

274
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:41,251
Your father says you're not going out
dressed that way.

275
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:42,841
And I'm not changing.

276
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:46,364
He says he's not changing.

277
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,887
I wanna talk to Hitler.

278
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:52,092
He has a swastika on his arm
and big black boots!

279
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,891
He's wearing big black boots!

280
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:56,687
He came down the stairs in them
with swastikas all over!

281
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:58,372
Put the <i>Fuhrer</i> on the phone.

282
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:02,169
Your father wants to talk to you.

283
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:14,802
Sorry.

284
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,007
You guys can go without me.

285
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,086
You sure?

286
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,802
Yeah, I'm having Halloween here.

287
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:41,045
What's wrong with boys today?

288
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:43,130
They have no sense of history.

289
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,723
The war ended when he was 7.
It's now nine years later.

290
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,806
To a kid, that's a lifetime.
To us, it's a blink of an eye.

291
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:52,203
Why does my kid have to dress up
like Hitler?

292
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:54,290
- He's not going trick-or-treating?
- No.

293
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:56,484
"Trick or treat. Hitler's here."

294
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:58,809
That'd look great
in our neighborhood.

295
00:16:59,053 --> 00:16:59,963
That's good.

296
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,521
We have to cross Falls Road
to get to this party.

297
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:04,529
Yeah, so?

298
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:06,571
Gentile turf.

299
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:09,651
Nick Campbell said this is gonna be
a good party.

300
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:14,122
I don't know. Across Falls Road.
Oh, boy.

301
00:17:15,893 --> 00:17:18,771
Get ready, folks! Jews are a-coming!

302
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,372
So where do you live?

303
00:17:57,573 --> 00:17:58,369
Forest Park.

304
00:17:58,813 --> 00:17:59,609
Forest Park?

305
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:01,610
Off Liberty Heights.

306
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:03,405
That's Jewish, isn't it?

307
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:07,088
Damn near, yeah. Lot of Jews.

308
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:10,968
Seems more is moving in too, you know?

309
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,211
It's getting that way.

310
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:34,012
<i>Halt!</i>

311
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:38,333
<i>Do not</i> shpritz <i>on the general!</i>

312
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:43,168
I go to the University of Baltimore.

313
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,567
That's nice.

314
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,842
My major is economics.

315
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,368
It's sort of a set subject.

316
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:52,962
Not much room for expressionism,
you know?

317
00:18:53,573 --> 00:18:54,767
Yeah, right.

318
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:57,129
I don't get to talk to people much.

319
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,971
Do you know everyone here?

320
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:00,526
These are all your friends?

321
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:03,088
Yes, we all go to school together.

322
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:04,772
- Pretty much.
- Nice people.

323
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:14,362
Excuse me.

324
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:23,326
Oh, my God!

325
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:35,405
Say, does that magic wand make
any wish come true?

326
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:37,365
It hasn't worked yet.

327
00:19:38,773 --> 00:19:39,967
What did you wish for?

328
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,483
Well, that's too personal a question.

329
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:46,563
I didn't mean to be too personal.
Sorry.

330
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,684
Are you afraid of being too intimate?

331
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,570
Or do you prefer small talk?

332
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,526
Kind of got me off guard.

333
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:59,044
Should I be more predictable?

334
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,842
Be whatever your heart desires.

335
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:06,447
Close your eyes.

336
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:11,005
Make a wish.

337
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,287
Was that it?

338
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,406
How you doing?

339
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,167
You didn't know?

340
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:30,690
Okay. She's your girl.
I'm very sorry. I didn't know.

341
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:33,851
There isn't a guy who doesn't know
that I go with Mary.

342
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:36,687
Here I am. You found one, okay?
No hard feelings.

343
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:38,849
Wait a minute, smart guy.

344
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:41,327
Got a question.

345
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:43,008
Where you from?

346
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:45,286
I'm from Forest Park.

347
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:47,807
Jewish?

348
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:50,168
What's your point?

349
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:51,567
It's just a question.

350
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:54,207
- Do you have a point?
- It's just a question.

351
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:57,086
I'm not here to answer
your stupid questions.

352
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,771
Stop it! Ted, it was nothing!

353
00:20:59,973 --> 00:21:02,362
I'm just asking if he was Jewish.
No big deal.

354
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:03,892
Fuck you, Tab Hunter.

355
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,091
- Stop it, Ted!
- Get off me!

356
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:11,483
Not inside! Outside! Outside.

357
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:13,842
Fine. Outside.

358
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:18,443
Jesus! He won't even say he's Jewish.

359
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:20,167
Oh, shit.

360
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:23,449
- Give me a beer.
- Get me one too.

361
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,527
Not now.

362
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:40,725
Van, we got trouble.

363
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,242
It's Yussel.

364
00:21:43,973 --> 00:21:46,089
I'm sorry, excuse me.
I'll be right back.

365
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:48,090
I'm gonna kill you guys.

366
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,046
Okay, listen up.

367
00:21:56,253 --> 00:21:59,563
This is between us, all right?
Nobody interferes.

368
00:22:00,893 --> 00:22:04,852
Hold on a second, all right?
Come here. What are you doing?

369
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:08,722
What did I tell you?

370
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:10,852
What did I tell you?

371
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:13,487
I said that crossing Falls Road
was a mistake!

372
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:15,445
I'll get you out of this.

373
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:18,121
Will you relax?
Stop. What are you doing?

374
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,402
Stop acting like this.

375
00:22:19,613 --> 00:22:23,128
I'm gonna bury this blond bastard,
and then we'll get out of here.

376
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,605
Come on. I'm just gonna slap you.
Come on.

377
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:54,850
It's a really simple question.

378
00:22:55,213 --> 00:22:56,362
Are you Jewish?

379
00:23:04,573 --> 00:23:06,131
Get up! Come on!

380
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:09,841
All you have to do is say it,
and it's over.

381
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:13,805
It's really a simple question.
Are you Jewish?

382
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,004
You say it, it's over. Okay?

383
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:26,331
That's enough, Ted!

384
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,162
Say it!

385
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:31,284
Say it! Say it, and it's over!

386
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:23,722
Jesus Christ!

387
00:24:26,613 --> 00:24:29,446
What kind of party is this?
Let's go, slugger.

388
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:32,522
No, I'm okay. I had him set up,
believe me.

389
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:33,802
Some great strategy.

390
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,563
Trey!
Trey, are you all right?

391
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:41,649
You okay?

392
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:43,932
I'm good.

393
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:45,532
The night is young.

394
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:47,883
He was getting winded.

395
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:49,088
Where's that girl?

396
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:52,086
Forget that girl.
Let's get the hell out of here.

397
00:24:52,293 --> 00:24:54,284
What girl's he talking about?

398
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,404
What are you doing? Let's go.

399
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:58,442
Let's go!

400
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:01,363
You missed a little fisticuff
back there.

401
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,564
This is very unfortunate.

402
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:08,728
You know, it's obvious the smiling
pumpkins distracted me.

403
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:15,008
Cinderella!

404
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,248
Okay, let's go, let's go. Now.

405
00:25:18,493 --> 00:25:20,085
We gotta get out of here!

406
00:25:20,493 --> 00:25:22,051
Does this thing open?

407
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:23,522
What are you doing?

408
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,052
Can I see you sometime?

409
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:26,288
Let's go. Now.

410
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,009
You know, that... Will you guys
give me a break for a minute?

411
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:31,328
Wait a minute!

412
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:33,246
Cinderella!

413
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:36,446
I'm gonna kill you.

414
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:40,848
- Got any beer?
- I know they have hard liquor.

415
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:43,004
Let's see what we can dig up.

416
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,683
Sorry I'm late for the ball,
sweetheart.

417
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:57,690
Well, that's a first for you.

418
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:06,325
Little cut there.

419
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:08,686
Tried to park.

420
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,171
I didn't even get her name.

421
00:26:41,373 --> 00:26:45,332
Story's all over the place. This guy
talked his date into blowing a horse.

422
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,649
How do you talk her
into blowing a horse?

423
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:50,048
- Don't believe it, then.
- Get back to logic.

424
00:26:50,253 --> 00:26:53,325
Where's a horse in Washington,
unless it's a police horse?

425
00:26:53,573 --> 00:26:54,926
And where's the cop?

426
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:56,282
Exactly.

427
00:27:00,293 --> 00:27:02,090
Nice feathers, boys. Where's Ben?

428
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:05,524
- He's at home celebrating.
- I knew they wouldn't let him out.

429
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:06,927
He's stubborn.

430
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:09,442
- Tell me about it.
- You hear about Sinatra?

431
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:12,087
We're going to the movie,
getting out of the car.

432
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:14,808
He says, "Can't get out
until Sinatra finishes."

433
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:19,165
I tried to get out. He grabs me and
yells, "No one walks out on Sinatra."

434
00:27:19,413 --> 00:27:21,722
We had to listen to the song,
then go.

435
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,441
- Like I don't know.
- We were late for the movie.

436
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:27,042
I didn't understand it
until two hours into it.

437
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:28,732
- That's impossible.
- It is.

438
00:27:30,013 --> 00:27:33,323
You think about it. Why spend
a night with any kind of horse...

439
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:36,001
...when you can have
Francis the Talking Mule?

440
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:37,328
He's a mule.

441
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:38,932
- A mule!
- That's another thing.

442
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:41,010
It's not as big a feat
if you blow a mule.

443
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:42,566
Is a mule or horse bigger?

444
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:46,971
I'd have to say a horse, because mules
are incapable of reproducing.

445
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:49,004
How do they reproduce?

446
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:51,568
They're incapable of reproducing.
They don't.

447
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:52,842
Do they have sperm?

448
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:57,208
- How do they make more mules?
- They breed horses and donkeys.

449
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:03,650
- How could you not get her name?
- I was flummoxed.

450
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:08,247
- She did the thing with the wand...
- Good luck finding her.

451
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,002
I got a bad case of blue balls
right now. I love this girl.

452
00:28:12,213 --> 00:28:14,488
You'll be in love alone.
She's history.

453
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,161
I am not going back over there...

454
00:28:17,373 --> 00:28:20,445
...with that Tab Hunter.
That son of a bitch.

455
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:25,288
He wanted to know.

456
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:29,202
When was the last time you wanted
to know if someone was Catholic?

457
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:32,246
Or Episcopalian or Methodist?
Who gives a shit?

458
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:34,921
What's the difference between
all those groups?

459
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:36,885
They all pray to Christ.

460
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,642
It's fine to have a Jew
hanging over the bed.

461
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:42,287
Just don't have him come through
the front door.

462
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:45,644
A dead Jew is okay.
I think that's the operative word.

463
00:28:45,853 --> 00:28:47,844
Go figure. They all pray to a Jew.

464
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,402
In a way, they're all
reformed Jews at heart.

465
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:52,331
I gotta find this girl.

466
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:54,285
You're gonna have to pray to God.

467
00:28:54,773 --> 00:28:56,172
A gentile God, mind you.

468
00:28:56,373 --> 00:29:00,332
<i>The Lord is my shepherd,</i>
<i>I shall not want.</i>

469
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:04,527
<i>He maketh me to lie down</i>
<i>in green pastures.</i>

470
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:08,089
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

471
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,807
He restoreth my soul.

472
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,450
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness...

473
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:16,843
...for His name's sake.

474
00:29:17,293 --> 00:29:21,525
<i>Yea, though I walk through</i>
<i>the valley of the shadow of death...</i>

475
00:29:21,733 --> 00:29:23,644
<i>... I will fear no evil...</i>

476
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,844
...for Thou art with me.

477
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:29,728
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

478
00:29:30,613 --> 00:29:31,762
Thou preparest...

479
00:29:31,973 --> 00:29:35,568
<i>... a table before me</i>
<i>in the presence of mine enemies.</i>

480
00:29:36,973 --> 00:29:39,771
Thou anointest my head with oil.

481
00:29:40,293 --> 00:29:42,249
My cup runneth over.

482
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:57,363
<i>- Goodness and mercy shall follow me</i>
<i>all the days of my life...</i>

483
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,886
<i>... and I will dwell</i>
<i>in the house of the Lord...</i>

484
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,486
...forever.

485
00:30:02,693 --> 00:30:04,126
Amen.

486
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,682
You got into a real brouhaha
this weekend.

487
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:10,247
You already heard?

488
00:30:10,453 --> 00:30:12,284
I had a police officer at my door.

489
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:14,085
Why? That fight was no big deal.

490
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:16,363
No, about the car crash.

491
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:19,246
- Why's a cop come and see you?
- About you guys.

492
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:20,568
Us? Why?

493
00:30:20,773 --> 00:30:25,005
The cop said he heard that you were
eyewitnesses to the accident.

494
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:27,681
A lot of people saw that.
Why do they need us?

495
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,372
I don't know.

496
00:30:29,573 --> 00:30:31,404
The guys must be goofing with us.

497
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:34,002
A lot of people saw this.
They don't need us.

498
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:37,250
The cops said Trey Travelstead was
driving recklessly...

499
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:39,364
...and running pumpkins over.

500
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:43,691
He ran through the patio, and there were
three guys from another part of town.

501
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:44,803
I knew names.

502
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:47,283
What, you gave the cops our names?

503
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:49,206
It wasn't a big deal.

504
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,324
That's terrific, you know?
Come here.

505
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:57,171
There was this girl there. I flipped
out on her. She was incredible.

506
00:30:57,373 --> 00:30:59,841
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

507
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,442
You know them.
Maybe you could ask around.

508
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,166
What does she look like?

509
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:08,123
She's gorgeous. Blond.
She looked like Cinderella.

510
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,609
She dressed like Cinderella.
She had a magic wand and everything.

511
00:31:11,813 --> 00:31:13,849
Cinderella didn't have a magic wand.

512
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:17,763
It's not important if Cinderella
had a wand. This girl had one.

513
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:20,368
Help me find this girl
with the magic wand.

514
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:23,883
She's gorgeous, blond
and carries a magic wand.

515
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,608
I'm Ben. I'm in your homeroom.

516
00:32:22,813 --> 00:32:24,041
I know.

517
00:32:28,853 --> 00:32:31,447
Where are you going?
I thought you lived around school.

518
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:34,690
Downtown. I'm going downtown.

519
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:40,209
Can I ask you a question?

520
00:32:40,413 --> 00:32:42,051
I guess.

521
00:32:42,853 --> 00:32:46,812
I always watch you say the 23rd Psalm,
and you seem so...

522
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:48,924
...you seem so absorbed.

523
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,361
Why?

524
00:32:50,853 --> 00:32:52,127
Why do you ask?

525
00:32:52,373 --> 00:32:55,126
I've never seen someone
so reverential, I guess.

526
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,292
For me, it's just a moment to myself,
that's all.

527
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:00,085
The big question is you.

528
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:01,328
Me?

529
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:05,811
Yeah, well, you're Jewish. So what's
the 23rd Psalm about for you?

530
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:09,362
I never really thought of it
as religious.

531
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:12,451
It's just something I've been saying
since first grade.

532
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:13,847
And?

533
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:19,083
Well, I always thought of the
23rd Psalm like the national anthem.

534
00:33:19,293 --> 00:33:22,171
It's just something you say
before the game starts.

535
00:33:22,373 --> 00:33:25,126
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

536
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,403
What does that mean to you?

537
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:29,052
Honestly?

538
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:30,692
No idea.

539
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:31,962
No idea?

540
00:33:33,973 --> 00:33:35,691
Nobody's making me lie down...

541
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:38,453
...and I don't know where
these green pastures are.

542
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:42,608
Has anyone ever anointed your head
with oil?

543
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:46,365
Has your cup ever runneth over?

544
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:48,804
No, it hasn't.

545
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:04,286
I'm going downtown.

546
00:34:09,573 --> 00:34:10,688
It's my stop.

547
00:34:11,373 --> 00:34:13,489
I thought you lived downtown.

548
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:15,649
Is that where I'm supposed to live?

549
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:19,528
Wait!

550
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:27,368
Sylvia, wait. Can I walk with you?

551
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,451
Can I walk with you?

552
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,563
I don't know if this is a good idea.

553
00:34:41,773 --> 00:34:43,968
I mean, we're getting close
to my house.

554
00:34:44,173 --> 00:34:46,528
My father comes home
in the afternoon on occasion.

555
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:50,123
He would not be thrilled to see me
walking home with a white boy.

556
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,448
I understand.

557
00:34:51,653 --> 00:34:53,484
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

558
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:07,171
You know what? Wait here.

559
00:35:07,453 --> 00:35:11,287
I'll get my mom's car and pick you up.
Get in fast, and get on the floor.

560
00:35:19,613 --> 00:35:21,171
I talked with our guys.

561
00:35:21,373 --> 00:35:24,046
I'm getting great feedback
on the bonus bet.

562
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,051
Mr. Kurtzman?

563
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:29,287
My costume didn't arrive here.
What should I do?

564
00:35:29,613 --> 00:35:30,887
Did you call suppliers?

565
00:35:31,093 --> 00:35:34,483
They said it should be here,
but it's not, so I think it's lost.

566
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:37,811
You'll just have to make do
with what's in storage.

567
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:42,285
No. I only wear my own outfits,
and they're very expensive.

568
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:44,042
What can I tell you?

569
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:46,209
I'm not wearing...

570
00:35:46,413 --> 00:35:49,132
...anybody else's costume on my body.

571
00:35:56,293 --> 00:35:57,328
Do I need this?

572
00:35:59,973 --> 00:36:00,962
Get in.

573
00:36:01,213 --> 00:36:03,283
Hurry up. Come on.

574
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:09,046
- Get on the floor.
- What?

575
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:10,572
Get on the floor.

576
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:12,172
Is this really necessary?

577
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:32,888
He's really good.

578
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:35,290
You never heard him before?

579
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:38,327
No, I only listen to
the regular radio.

580
00:36:38,893 --> 00:36:40,485
You listen to "regular radio"?

581
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:42,604
What is this?
What am I listening to?

582
00:36:44,653 --> 00:36:48,089
The other kind of...
The other radio stations.

583
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,012
There's a place near the zoo.
No one will see us there.

584
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,209
I think we should go to the zoo.

585
00:36:59,413 --> 00:37:01,369
Yeah, great. Good. The zoo.

586
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,009
Does your dad know Cab Calloway?

587
00:37:11,213 --> 00:37:12,851
Why would you ask that?

588
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:16,244
Well, he went to Douglass High.
You know, the Negro school.

589
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:18,171
No, he doesn't.

590
00:37:18,373 --> 00:37:19,965
What about Billie Holiday?

591
00:37:20,813 --> 00:37:24,328
What, just because we're Negro,
we should know all the Negroes?

592
00:37:24,653 --> 00:37:25,802
I don't know. Maybe.

593
00:37:26,053 --> 00:37:28,123
Do you know Albert Einstein, then?

594
00:37:29,053 --> 00:37:33,251
No, but I think my family knows
some of the Einsteins.

595
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:36,326
Are you serious?

596
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:08,849
You think she could find one outfit?

597
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:10,924
She's got some germ thing.

598
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:13,442
She doesn't like to wear
anybody else's stuff.

599
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,448
This is very unique.

600
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:31,289
I've got a stripper who's dressed
like my cousin Marcia.

601
00:38:38,373 --> 00:38:42,286
This is nuts. The odds on finding
this girl are like one in a million.

602
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:46,327
Trust me, okay?
I have a feeling she's there.

603
00:38:47,013 --> 00:38:48,844
We have to find the neighborhood...

604
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,288
...and she has to be coincidentally...

605
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:53,165
...walking around at this time.

606
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:57,002
Nick Campbell is checking her out.
You can't give him time?

607
00:38:57,213 --> 00:39:00,205
I can't. I can't wait.
She's on my mind all the time.

608
00:39:00,413 --> 00:39:02,005
What are we supposed to do?

609
00:39:02,213 --> 00:39:04,727
Just look for the glow
of the girl's tiara?

610
00:39:04,973 --> 00:39:07,692
I think I see somebody
with a magic wand.

611
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:11,249
If you guys would stop talking
and look around, please.

612
00:39:11,453 --> 00:39:13,569
She'll be the one person
walking around?

613
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:22,449
I hope she doesn't hurt herself.

614
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:29,052
Where the hell are we right now?
Where are we?

615
00:39:30,413 --> 00:39:32,324
I don't know.
We must've left the area.

616
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:33,886
- Great!
- I'm sorry.

617
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:36,203
I have other things on my mind.

618
00:39:36,413 --> 00:39:38,324
This neighborhood makes me nervous.

619
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:40,649
Three guys were walking around
with tools.

620
00:39:40,853 --> 00:39:42,172
I'll get us out of here.

621
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:45,092
You know, there's no such thing
as a dream girl.

622
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:49,809
Do you think that my father thought
that my mother was a dream girl?

623
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:51,122
No way!

624
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:54,768
Let me tell you something.
This girl...

625
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:58,164
I am obsessed...
This is meant to be. Preordained.

626
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:02,242
Dream girls were invented by God
to tease the apparatus. That's all.

627
00:40:02,893 --> 00:40:04,087
You settle for less.

628
00:40:04,293 --> 00:40:05,726
- That's not the point.
- What is?

629
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,288
Dream girls.

630
00:40:07,493 --> 00:40:10,405
I'd rather not be
looking for my dream girl...

631
00:40:10,613 --> 00:40:13,252
...which I had to leave
because you were fighting!

632
00:40:13,613 --> 00:40:15,683
Do me a favor. Lose my number.

633
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:18,965
I don't know if I wanna
continue this relationship.

634
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:26,165
Come on! Come on!

635
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:29,524
I think she's gonna go too far.
We're going to jail.

636
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:31,612
Damn good act.

637
00:40:40,013 --> 00:40:42,243
Some show. Best in years.

638
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:45,843
If she starts showing breasts
without tassels, kill the spot.

639
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:49,801
If she takes off her underwear,
kill the spot.

640
00:40:50,013 --> 00:40:52,083
Nate, no! Nate, but...

641
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:53,692
No "buts."

642
00:40:56,133 --> 00:40:57,771
This is some act.

643
00:40:58,533 --> 00:41:00,091
For 23 people.

644
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:24,243
I wasn't finished yet.

645
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:29,445
That's as much as you can show.

646
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,168
I wasn't gonna show more.
I was gonna give it a proper ending.

647
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:34,328
Do it tomorrow.

648
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,649
My costume should be here by then.

649
00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:38,844
This is your costume from now on.

650
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:44,003
You like?

651
00:41:44,573 --> 00:41:45,483
I like.

652
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:47,283
You?

653
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,003
He likes.

654
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:56,202
I like.

655
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,083
I don't want you going out tonight.

656
00:42:07,293 --> 00:42:08,965
Just going on the porch.

657
00:42:14,253 --> 00:42:17,723
So what's the news?
What's the big secret?

658
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:20,811
I was with Sylvia.

659
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:25,762
In her car.

660
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,362
No, her car?

661
00:42:27,573 --> 00:42:29,086
Her mother's car.

662
00:42:29,893 --> 00:42:31,212
You got laid.

663
00:42:31,613 --> 00:42:32,443
Bare tit?

664
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:34,524
You ever hear Negro music?

665
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,086
I need details.

666
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,972
No, it was nothing like that.
The music's great.

667
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:41,572
What the hell did you do?

668
00:42:41,773 --> 00:42:42,728
We talked.

669
00:42:42,973 --> 00:42:44,406
Talked? Bullshit.

670
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:47,002
No. I mean, we talked.

671
00:42:48,013 --> 00:42:49,446
I hear they got soft skin.

672
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:51,166
I didn't touch her.

673
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:54,489
No details, I'm going home.

674
00:42:54,693 --> 00:42:57,048
No. We talked a lot.

675
00:42:57,293 --> 00:43:00,842
I mean, we talked about
Negro singers and comics.

676
00:43:01,093 --> 00:43:02,685
It was great, unbelievable.

677
00:43:04,093 --> 00:43:05,048
She blew you.

678
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:10,606
- I don't believe you.
- Why would I tell you I was with her?

679
00:43:10,813 --> 00:43:11,768
I don't know.

680
00:43:12,013 --> 00:43:14,971
You talked with a colored girl
about comedy and music.

681
00:43:15,173 --> 00:43:16,686
That's bullshit.

682
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,611
<i>All in all, the take is up 9o/o.</i>

683
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:23,768
<i>Good, good.</i>

684
00:43:23,973 --> 00:43:25,406
Get a chair.

685
00:43:25,613 --> 00:43:27,683
We're even getting
some white business.

686
00:43:27,893 --> 00:43:32,091
Coloreds and white betting numbers
together. Does the heart good.

687
00:43:32,293 --> 00:43:33,646
Look. Germantown, good.

688
00:43:33,853 --> 00:43:37,641
Greektown, good. Even Pigtown.
All white areas, they all show a bump.

689
00:43:38,133 --> 00:43:41,250
I hear the state is thinking
of a lottery.

690
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:44,047
Lukie Saperstein's been pushing that
since the war.

691
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:46,767
It's popular in Annapolis.
They want new revenue.

692
00:43:47,013 --> 00:43:50,244
They should legalize gambling.
Vegas is going through the roof.

693
00:43:50,453 --> 00:43:53,411
They've already got slots
in Anne Arundel County.

694
00:43:53,613 --> 00:43:57,083
The <i>farchadat</i> government. They think
they could run a numbers racket?

695
00:43:57,293 --> 00:43:59,284
Lottery! It's unconstitutional.

696
00:43:59,493 --> 00:44:02,405
They're taking money out of the mouth
of the entrepreneur.

697
00:44:02,613 --> 00:44:04,331
Smacks of socialism.

698
00:44:04,533 --> 00:44:07,969
The government integrates the
golf course in '51 and schools in '54.

699
00:44:08,173 --> 00:44:09,606
Where's their priorities?

700
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:13,442
They integrated cricket in '50.
Can't find a colored playing cricket.

701
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:16,167
That was part of the
separate-but-equal ruling.

702
00:44:16,373 --> 00:44:18,284
Coloreds could only play on Tuesdays.

703
00:44:18,493 --> 00:44:22,850
You can't find one to play on Tuesday,
Wednesday or kiss-my-<i>tochis</i> day.

704
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:26,563
You can't find a white person
who wants to play cricket.

705
00:44:26,773 --> 00:44:30,129
It makes no sense. How many players
do you need? They use a mallet?

706
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:31,971
- Is that with hoops?
- That's croquet.

707
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:34,641
- Croquet is something you eat.
- Everything is something you eat.

708
00:44:34,853 --> 00:44:36,081
I saw it in the menu.

709
00:44:36,293 --> 00:44:39,729
Charlie, keep an eye on this.
Just what we need. A state lottery.

710
00:44:40,173 --> 00:44:41,970
Who is gonna testify first?

711
00:44:42,173 --> 00:44:44,164
It's alphabetical, I guess.

712
00:44:44,373 --> 00:44:49,049
You know, I tell you, I still cannot
believe that we have to testify.

713
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:52,370
Trey Travelstead must've come
on the <i>Mayflower</i> with Pilgrims.

714
00:44:52,613 --> 00:44:57,164
You know, that whole Pilgrim thing
makes me very uneasy. Very uneasy.

715
00:44:58,253 --> 00:44:59,732
Alan, what time you got?

716
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:03,889
It's 12:30.
We have to be in court at 2.

717
00:45:05,493 --> 00:45:07,211
Let me ask you a stupid question.

718
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,962
You know all these lawyer shows.
<i>Perry Mason,</i> the others.

719
00:45:11,413 --> 00:45:14,052
They say in court,
"Do you swear to tell the truth...

720
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:17,086
...the whole truth, nothing but
the truth, so help you God?"

721
00:45:17,293 --> 00:45:18,965
The witness always says, "Yeah."

722
00:45:19,573 --> 00:45:20,847
What if you say "no"?

723
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,003
What do you mean?

724
00:45:22,213 --> 00:45:25,011
"I'll tell you what I know,
but I won't swear to God."

725
00:45:25,293 --> 00:45:26,521
What happens?

726
00:45:26,773 --> 00:45:28,126
Got me.

727
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,449
Interesting.
I'll ask a law student.

728
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:32,491
Let's try it today.

729
00:45:32,853 --> 00:45:33,683
Who?

730
00:45:33,893 --> 00:45:35,167
Whoever's called first.

731
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,405
- It's good by me.
- It's good by you?

732
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:38,568
Yeah, why not?

733
00:45:38,773 --> 00:45:41,048
- No, that's good by me.
- He's in.

734
00:45:41,453 --> 00:45:44,604
<i>Prosecution calls Sylvan Kurtzman</i>
<i>to the stand.</i>

735
00:45:53,813 --> 00:45:57,203
Put your left hand on this Bible.
Raise your right hand.

736
00:45:57,533 --> 00:46:00,491
You swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

737
00:46:01,813 --> 00:46:02,609
No.

738
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:05,329
What?

739
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:06,529
No.

740
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:10,125
What's going on here?

741
00:46:10,773 --> 00:46:13,207
You're a Communist!
Nothing but a Commie!

742
00:46:16,213 --> 00:46:18,773
Your Honor, he's a Red!
I'm telling you...

743
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:20,366
...he's godless!

744
00:46:24,453 --> 00:46:25,727
- Order!
- You're a pinko!

745
00:46:25,973 --> 00:46:26,962
Order! Order!

746
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:28,288
You're a Communist!

747
00:46:30,013 --> 00:46:31,446
Order in the court!

748
00:46:34,973 --> 00:46:38,761
I'd like to call a 10-minute recess.
Counselors, see me in chambers.

749
00:46:39,613 --> 00:46:42,173
- You may step down.
- Thank you, sir.

750
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:49,450
The guy's got some serious balls.
Gotta give him credit.

751
00:46:50,413 --> 00:46:53,530
<i>Every year, 50 or 60 Negroes</i>
<i>pass for white.</i>

<i>"Haven 't seen you</i>

756
00:47:04,893 --> 00:47:07,771
<i>You open that sucker's mouth up,</i>

757
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:15,047

758
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:17,491
<i>No, I didn 't dig school.</i>

<i>They got nothing about</i>

762
00:47:31,013 --> 00:47:33,208
I've never heard anything like this.

763
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:34,971
It's great, isn't it?

764
00:47:35,493 --> 00:47:37,245
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

765
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:40,287
<i>No matter what color you are,</i>
<i>when the lights go out...</i>

766
00:47:40,493 --> 00:47:43,132
<i>... it becomes a question</i>
<i>of "Who washed?"</i>

767
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:50,611
Mr. Kurtzman, you could be held
in contempt of court...

768
00:47:50,813 --> 00:47:52,531
...and I may have ruled so...

769
00:47:52,733 --> 00:47:56,408
...but the prosecution has decided
not to pursue this action.

770
00:47:56,653 --> 00:47:59,406
- So you may step down.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

Court calls Alan Zuckerman
to the stand.

772
00:48:10,293 --> 00:48:12,727
- State your full name.
- Alan Joseph Zuckerman.

773
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,362
Place your left hand on this Bible.
Raise your right hand.

774
00:48:15,573 --> 00:48:18,929
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

775
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:20,282
Yes.

776
00:48:20,493 --> 00:48:21,767
Be seated.

777
00:48:22,013 --> 00:48:25,483
Where were you on the night
of October 28, 1954?

778
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:28,762
- The night of the accident?
- Objection.

779
00:48:29,013 --> 00:48:31,766
We have not established the nature
of the accident...

780
00:48:32,053 --> 00:48:34,203
...or that an accident did
in fact occur.

781
00:48:34,613 --> 00:48:36,251
Objection sustained.

782
00:48:36,653 --> 00:48:38,166
Answer the question.

783
00:48:38,613 --> 00:48:42,288
Well, if that wasn't
the night of the accident...

784
00:48:42,493 --> 00:48:45,053
...then I don't know where I was.

785
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:50,523
You gotta give me some kind of hint.
Was that Halloween?

786
00:48:54,573 --> 00:48:56,768
I just wanted to thank you
for helping out.

787
00:48:57,013 --> 00:48:58,571
It wasn't really about you.

788
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:01,651
If there's anything I can do
for you, don't hesitate.

789
00:49:01,853 --> 00:49:03,730
I certainly feel indebted.

790
00:49:04,693 --> 00:49:07,412
Look, we'd like to offer an apology
to your friend.

791
00:49:08,253 --> 00:49:09,811
Ted was out of line.

792
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,846
- I didn't mean the way it came across.
- Forget about it.

793
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:15,328
You know what?
Maybe you can help me.

794
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:18,970
There was this girl at the party
who was a knockout.

795
00:49:19,173 --> 00:49:22,643
I don't know her name,
but I'd really like to find out.

796
00:49:22,853 --> 00:49:25,890
- What did she look like?
- She was beautiful.

797
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:30,285
Blond. She was wearing this princess
or Cinderella kind of costume.

798
00:49:30,493 --> 00:49:31,767
You found her attractive?

799
00:49:32,093 --> 00:49:34,004
She knocked me out.

800
00:49:34,373 --> 00:49:35,169
Sound familiar?

801
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:37,246
I guess.

802
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:39,691
We'll ask around.
Give me your number.

803
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:40,723
Yeah, sure thing.

804
00:49:40,973 --> 00:49:43,726
She's blond. Had a magic wand.

805
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:45,807
Thanks.

806
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,007
I'll call.

807
00:49:48,373 --> 00:49:49,442
Great.

808
00:49:52,493 --> 00:49:53,846
What are you doing?

809
00:49:54,093 --> 00:49:56,846
He was talking about Dubbie.
Your girl, last time I asked.

810
00:49:57,053 --> 00:49:58,202
He's a good guy.

811
00:50:00,093 --> 00:50:02,607
We'll get another girl.
There must be one he'd like.

812
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:05,202
What about Maggie?
She's to die for.

813
00:50:05,493 --> 00:50:08,690
Maggie, Caroline, Megan, one of them.

814
00:50:47,773 --> 00:50:49,491
One bed, one record.

815
00:51:29,893 --> 00:51:32,248
I'm sorry. Did I do that?

816
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,482
Well...

817
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:37,804
I'm sorry.

818
00:51:41,053 --> 00:51:42,850
Does it happen that easily?

819
00:51:43,093 --> 00:51:45,084
Not that I know of. No.

820
00:51:45,293 --> 00:51:47,761
It just goes off like that?

821
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:50,569
Well, I think...

822
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:54,962
...I've been worked up,
you know, all along, and...

823
00:51:56,853 --> 00:51:58,252
You don't like the records?

824
00:51:58,613 --> 00:52:01,491
No. I like the records.

825
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:04,971
I just think if it's...

826
00:52:05,813 --> 00:52:08,486
...well, been percolating
for a long time...

827
00:52:10,453 --> 00:52:12,205
...it's got no place to go.

828
00:52:12,573 --> 00:52:14,291
You have to use the bathroom?

829
00:52:15,893 --> 00:52:19,522
It's right over there.
Around the corner.

830
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:21,371
I'll be right back.

831
00:52:41,613 --> 00:52:44,889
So do you think maybe we could
do this tomorrow?

832
00:52:45,173 --> 00:52:47,243
Well, I hope so. If my mom's out.

833
00:52:50,093 --> 00:52:52,049
Oh, my God. It's my father.

834
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:54,209
- What do I do?
- Get in the closet.

835
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:01,010
What are you doing?
Don't you have homework?

836
00:53:01,213 --> 00:53:03,010
I was just taking a break.

837
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,732
- Your mother call?
- No.

838
00:53:05,173 --> 00:53:08,085
But she said this morning
to expect her early evening.

839
00:53:09,013 --> 00:53:10,765
Get back to your homework.

840
00:53:17,053 --> 00:53:18,202
What's going on?

841
00:53:20,853 --> 00:53:22,002
I have a boy over.

842
00:53:22,613 --> 00:53:26,208
But it was nothing. We were just
listening to records. That's it.

843
00:53:26,733 --> 00:53:28,086
And where is he?

844
00:53:29,053 --> 00:53:31,203
He's in the closet.

845
00:53:32,373 --> 00:53:34,762
If nothing went on,
why is he in the closet?

846
00:53:36,293 --> 00:53:37,726
Because he's white.

847
00:53:41,533 --> 00:53:43,046
How could you do such a thing?

848
00:53:43,893 --> 00:53:45,042
We didn't do anything.

849
00:53:45,253 --> 00:53:46,163
What's his name?

850
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:48,202
Ben Kurtzman.

851
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:51,849
- Mr. Kurtzman?
- Yes, sir.

852
00:53:52,093 --> 00:53:55,881
Sylvia is not allowed to be with
a white boy. It's not respectful.

853
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:57,327
I was respectful, sir.

854
00:53:57,533 --> 00:54:00,650
- You're in my daughter's bedroom.
- Yes, sir.

855
00:54:01,973 --> 00:54:03,565
Mr. Kurtzman.

856
00:54:04,373 --> 00:54:06,443
Would you come out of the closet?

857
00:54:06,653 --> 00:54:07,722
Yes, sir.

858
00:54:10,453 --> 00:54:11,408
Now?

859
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:17,850
I don't ever wanna see you
with my daughter again.

860
00:54:18,053 --> 00:54:21,045
At school you will be
respectful and cordial...

861
00:54:21,253 --> 00:54:23,892
...but no activities outside school.
Is that clear?

862
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:25,646
Yes, sir. I just don't think...

863
00:54:25,853 --> 00:54:29,129
It's very clear to my daughter.
Don't you agree, Sylvia?

864
00:54:30,213 --> 00:54:31,168
Yes.

865
00:54:32,093 --> 00:54:33,811
Now, will you please leave?

866
00:54:34,133 --> 00:54:35,851
He needs a ride home.

867
00:54:37,453 --> 00:54:40,445
I'll drive him.
Sylvia, you will remain here.

868
00:54:59,373 --> 00:55:01,250
- This is your house?
- Yes, sir.

869
00:55:02,893 --> 00:55:04,645
Shouldn't you be getting out?

870
00:55:04,853 --> 00:55:06,605
It's Sinatra, sir.

871
00:55:07,413 --> 00:55:08,448
So?

872
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:11,528
You don't walk out on Frank, sir.

873
00:55:11,733 --> 00:55:13,849
I mean, it would be too disrespectful.

874
00:55:24,853 --> 00:55:25,683
I gotta go.

875
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:42,046
Okay, it's over now.

876
00:55:50,893 --> 00:55:52,326
Good night, sir.

877
00:56:01,373 --> 00:56:03,648
This is it. 2-2-3.
The bonus was 4.

878
00:56:03,853 --> 00:56:06,242
Listen. Do you know what
that means on $50?

879
00:56:06,453 --> 00:56:07,852
- $ 100,000.
- We're screwed!

880
00:56:08,093 --> 00:56:09,492
Screwed is not the word.

881
00:56:09,693 --> 00:56:12,844
- Who bets $50 on a number?
- Nobody bets $50.

882
00:56:13,973 --> 00:56:15,201
Nobody bets $50.

883
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,846
What do we got in reserve?

884
00:56:17,093 --> 00:56:19,209
We don't have enough
to cover the bet.

885
00:56:19,413 --> 00:56:21,005
Tell him, but he's at dinner!

886
00:56:21,213 --> 00:56:23,204
I will call. All right?

887
00:56:24,053 --> 00:56:25,884
- He's gonna kill me.
- It's ringing.

888
00:56:26,413 --> 00:56:27,528
Thanks, Ma.

889
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:29,483
What's up?

890
00:56:29,693 --> 00:56:31,570
You're not gonna believe this.

891
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:34,683
I'm sick to my stomach.

892
00:56:35,093 --> 00:56:36,162
Charlie, what?

893
00:56:36,453 --> 00:56:38,967
Somebody hit the number and the bonus.

894
00:56:42,053 --> 00:56:43,964
The payout is $ 100,000.

895
00:56:44,453 --> 00:56:46,444
A hundred thousand...?!

896
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:50,042
Oh, my God. Are you sure?

897
00:56:50,253 --> 00:56:52,289
I checked it six times over.

898
00:56:52,773 --> 00:56:53,808
Jesus!

899
00:56:54,053 --> 00:56:56,169
We don't have that kind of money.

900
00:56:56,373 --> 00:56:58,011
I'm coming down.

901
00:57:02,173 --> 00:57:03,322
What's happening?

902
00:57:04,813 --> 00:57:06,007
I've gotta go.

903
00:57:06,213 --> 00:57:08,681
We've got problems.

904
00:57:44,533 --> 00:57:47,843
He's Little Melvin. Colored
drug dealer on Pennsylvania Avenue.

905
00:57:48,053 --> 00:57:50,328
Sells reefer. Strictly smalltime.

906
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:52,922
Bets 50 to celebrate
his mother's birthday.

907
00:57:53,133 --> 00:57:54,771
This wipes me out.

908
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:58,767
Little Melvin called.
He's coming by to pick up his haul.

909
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:00,571
- You didn't let on?
- No, no.

910
00:58:00,773 --> 00:58:03,924
Listen, Nate, I feel responsible.
The bonus was my idea.

911
00:58:04,133 --> 00:58:05,725
To hell with this apology shit.

912
00:58:05,973 --> 00:58:08,885
I bought the idea.
Nobody bets 50 on a number.

913
00:58:09,093 --> 00:58:11,323
A nickel, a dime, a buck.
Five, tops.

914
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:13,808
$50, never. It's unheard of!

915
00:58:14,053 --> 00:58:15,008
What'll we do?

916
00:58:15,213 --> 00:58:17,886
We don't have a lot of time
to find a solution.

917
00:58:20,253 --> 00:58:23,211
So how come we never talk
about what Dad does?

918
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:25,165
Because it's illegal.

919
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:28,612
But not that bad.

920
00:58:28,813 --> 00:58:30,690
Is everything gonna be all right?

921
00:58:32,213 --> 00:58:34,044
Your father takes care of himself.

922
00:58:35,573 --> 00:58:38,451
<i>Why don 't you tell them</i>
<i>about Patterson Park?</i>

923
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,009
<i>What about Patterson Park?</i>

924
00:58:43,613 --> 00:58:47,322
<i>When your father was a teenager,</i>
<i>he went over to Patterson Park.</i>

925
00:58:47,533 --> 00:58:48,886
<i>Why, I'll never know.</i>

926
00:58:49,853 --> 00:58:53,528
<i>He saw some guys playing ball,</i>
<i>and he tried to get into the game.</i>

927
00:58:54,533 --> 00:58:58,572
One of the guys asked if your father
was Jewish. He said he was.

928
00:58:58,773 --> 00:59:02,083
One thing led to another,
and your father was beaten up.

929
00:59:02,533 --> 00:59:03,966
Black and blue.

930
00:59:06,653 --> 00:59:10,566
After that, he went to the J.C.C.
Every day after school to learn to box.

931
00:59:10,773 --> 00:59:14,448
For six months, he trained every day.

932
00:59:15,413 --> 00:59:17,688
Then he went back to Patterson Park.

933
00:59:18,773 --> 00:59:21,207
Got up on a car and yelled:

934
00:59:22,093 --> 00:59:24,368
"There's a Jew in the neighborhood!

935
00:59:24,573 --> 00:59:27,565
Anyone who doesn't like it, step up."

936
00:59:29,773 --> 00:59:32,128
He beat up seven guys that day.

937
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:37,167
Your father takes care of himself.

938
00:59:53,413 --> 00:59:56,450
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

939
00:59:56,813 --> 01:00:00,249
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

940
01:00:00,613 --> 01:00:03,605
He leadeth me beside still waters.

941
01:00:04,693 --> 01:00:06,604
<i>He restoreth my soul.</i>

942
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:37,564
- And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

943
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:39,412
Amen.

944
01:00:41,573 --> 01:00:43,086
Mr. Melvin.

945
01:00:50,373 --> 01:00:53,968
I'm thinking of giving you
the southeast territory.

946
01:00:54,173 --> 01:00:56,812
You take over the numbers.
Long-term dollars.

947
01:00:58,053 --> 01:01:00,169
You trying to Jew me out my money?

948
01:01:01,053 --> 01:01:02,042
Watch your tongue.

949
01:01:02,253 --> 01:01:04,209
I don't take shit from no Heb.

950
01:01:04,413 --> 01:01:06,768
You coon, I'll put my fist
down your throat!

951
01:01:06,973 --> 01:01:10,249
You hook-nosed kike! Little Melvin
don't take shit from nobody!

952
01:01:10,453 --> 01:01:12,842
You're a dead man,
you bush-monkey burrhead!

953
01:01:13,093 --> 01:01:14,446
I ain't scared of nobody!

954
01:01:14,693 --> 01:01:16,172
Back him up! Back him up!

955
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:17,362
Stop it!

956
01:01:17,733 --> 01:01:19,212
Goddamn it! Stop it!

957
01:01:19,413 --> 01:01:20,368
Stop it!

958
01:01:20,573 --> 01:01:23,007
We've all come too far
to stoop to this.

959
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:26,168
Charlie, get Little Melvin his money.

960
01:01:26,613 --> 01:01:28,763
He won't see the big picture,
that's his problem.

961
01:01:32,893 --> 01:01:34,167
What's my problem?

962
01:01:34,373 --> 01:01:36,682
I apologize.
You make yourself comfortable.

963
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:39,009
Charlie's gonna get your money.

964
01:01:46,773 --> 01:01:49,571
Exactly how big a picture is
this here big picture?

965
01:01:53,493 --> 01:01:56,963
The southeast territory generates
just under 10 grand a month.

966
01:01:57,173 --> 01:01:59,129
In less than a year,
you've got payback.

967
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:03,645
After that, it's "ka-ching," day in,
day out. That's what I had in mind.

968
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,332
Week in, week out?

969
01:02:08,173 --> 01:02:10,767
It's your call.
You go for the short-term money...

970
01:02:11,013 --> 01:02:13,208
...or you go for the long haul.

971
01:02:16,893 --> 01:02:19,361
All mine, now?
Clean? No middleman?

972
01:02:26,693 --> 01:02:29,253
Why you giving up the territory then?

973
01:02:29,453 --> 01:02:33,287
Look, there's no question that 100,000
cuts into my cash flow.

974
01:02:33,493 --> 01:02:34,846
I can live with that.

975
01:02:35,493 --> 01:02:38,371
But this burlesque,
it's too time-consuming.

976
01:02:38,573 --> 01:02:41,883
You get a little older,
your priorities change.

977
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:10,481
<i>That was a good decision.</i>

978
01:03:10,693 --> 01:03:13,969
<i>You better keep a leash</i>
<i>on the Pillsbury Jew-boy over there.</i>

979
01:03:14,453 --> 01:03:16,967
- The money?
- Bigger things on the horizon.

980
01:03:17,173 --> 01:03:21,212
<i>How can we give him the southeast</i>
<i>territory? The wops own it.</i>

981
01:03:21,413 --> 01:03:23,688
<i>Wait a couple days,</i>
<i>call Little Melvin...</i>

982
01:03:23,893 --> 01:03:26,123
<i>... say the southeast territory</i>
<i>won 't work out.</i>

983
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:28,244
<i>We have to put a new deal</i>
<i>on the table.</i>

984
01:03:28,453 --> 01:03:32,002
<i>And let him pick the meeting spot.</i>
<i>Make him feel good.</i>

985
01:03:35,973 --> 01:03:37,326
Phone book.

986
01:03:46,613 --> 01:03:48,490
All right, students, settle down.

987
01:03:48,693 --> 01:03:50,445
Put your books on your head.

988
01:03:53,453 --> 01:03:55,011
I slipped you two tickets.
