1
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,732
I have a lot to think through

2
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,239
Your mother led such a good life

3
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,240
Her passing should be celebrated
not mourned

4
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,245
Ma did so much

5
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,080
But, what have I achieved?

6
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,283
You're taking this photo with you

7
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,346
This one's my favorite

8
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,221
Nashaad, you have many more

9
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:14,152
Neither you'll be here nor the photo,
how will I survive?

10
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,629
Leela, please don't go

11
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,799
Don't say like that Nashaad, I'm
not going forever

12
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:23,969
Will you write?

13
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,635
Everyday.. and you?

14
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:31,469
I'll write one song for you. Everyday.

15
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,506
It seems from your letters that..

16
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,012
America is suiting you

17
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,844
But your suitors here are wilting.

18
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:46,856
Hamid can't wait for you to come back.

19
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,959
Yesterday Kali Prasad had come...

20
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,357
And he moped around for
an hour today

21
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,961
Your admirers are
suffering here Leela.

22
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,328
With your favorite poet
being the foremost

23
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:10,248
I live in the fragrant Spring

24
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:19,555
....inebriated by your absence
wrapped up in your thoughts

25
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:24,218
Dearest, it's been three weeks
since I've seen you

26
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,723
But it feels like three years

27
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,691
You were right Nashaad.

28
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,361
I've already found a 'fan' here

29
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,524
You won't believe what happened today...

30
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:30,319
In search of my sweetheart
I hold my breath

31
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:40,996
Every living moment
ls a moment of death for me

32
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:51,007
I live wrapped up in your thoughts

33
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,034
Nashaad, I wish you were here

34
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:25,470
I got another invitation
to perform in America

35
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,236
How do I gently refuse?

36
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,544
I've heard they ask poet to
sing films songs! Oh God!

37
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:54,906
You promised to write everyday

38
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:58,406
I haven't heard from you in a week

39
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:00,411
Is everything alright?

40
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:03,578
Is there something you want to tell me?

41
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:33,444
Is Nashaad there?

42
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:34,783
Who's calling?

43
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,445
Get Nashaad on the line

44
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:39,284
Just a moment

45
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,624
Nashaad who was that woman

46
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,459
Leela, sweetheart

47
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,301
I want to know who that woman was

48
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:54,629
Leela, my sweet heart

49
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:57,799
I cannot believe that you could

50
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,133
...bring another woman to our bed!

51
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:00,138
Leela, listen to me

52
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:01,810
I don't want to listen to anything

53
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:09,954
Leela, I don't know how
I've survived the last few months

54
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:14,635
Without seeing your face...
smelling your hair

55
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:20,271
Without breathing the same air
that you breathe

56
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,269
There is so much I want to tell you

57
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,873
I've written a whole book of poems for you

58
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,044
Sitting on our balcony

59
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:33,978
Inspired by the vast ocean

60
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,381
I wrote a song for you everyday

61
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:39,424
But now, I only want to look at you

62
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:41,994
How have you been Leela?

63
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:48,430
You haven't even mentioned
your "boyfriend"!

64
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:54,107
You wrote so much about him
I feel like I know him.

65
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:58,312
You know why I came, don't you?

66
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:02,107
I don't know what happened to you
that night

67
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:04,611
I was scared, Leela

68
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:09,349
I can never cause you any pain

69
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:14,960
Sweetheart

70
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,305
Nashaadsahab, please sing for us

71
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:30,910
Please don't insist, Naheed

72
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:35,641
You can't do this to your fans

73
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:41,186
Won't you heed this small request?

74
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:47,050
Singing is not my profession
It is my passion

75
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:53,365
I'm honored that you like what I write

76
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:56,197
But, please don't ask me to sing here

77
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,404
I don't think I've had the pleasure

78
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,182
You flatter me Mrs. Chatterjee

79
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:31,606
Come...Thanks

80
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:37,040
Joya is giving me an invaluable lesson
in expatriate morality

81
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:17,205
All my music, my poetry, my art
ls for Leela

82
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,375
Then please sing for us

83
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,673
You really want me to sing?

84
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:24,081
Alright I will

85
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:27,851
Jai, Nashaad has finally agreed to sing

86
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:31,321
We can do it here

87
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,095
What would you need?

88
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:36,462
A tanpura, a tabla..and...

89
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:46,331
Kris plays the guitar extremely well

90
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:48,838
Krishna, will you play with me?

91
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:12,185
How long will you make me wait?
Come to bed

92
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:15,056
I still have work to do

93
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:16,855
Can't it wait?

94
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:18,623
I'll join you soon

95
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,528
So said the moon to the night...

96
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:24,327
But when the moon was ready

97
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:27,434
Night had already turned to day

98
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:31,539
The moon had lost it's luster...

99
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:33,943
That's enough, Nashaad

100
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:39,077
Leela, I've noticed a change in you

101
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:41,152
Because I don't agree with
everything you say?

102
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:44,723
No, you are an independent woman..

103
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:46,621
Independent?

104
01:22:47,662 --> 01:22:52,190
All these years you've twisted me
around your fingers

105
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:57,734
But the day you brought
a whore to our bed

106
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:03,104
Leela, please.. that woman was Simran

107
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:06,770
And you were too angry to notice

108
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:08,879
Simran? Your niece?

109
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:11,985
Yes. What hurt the most was that

110
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:15,486
...you'd believe I could do such a thing

111
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,055
You are my life

112
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:29,793
I need some time..

113
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:34,170
By myself..

114
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:37,141
Away from you

115
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:43,041
What are you saying?

116
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:48,456
You are the light of my whole being

117
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,083
And you want to leave me in the dark?

118
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:56,254
I love you and I know you love me more

119
01:23:57,432 --> 01:23:59,127
This is not about you...

120
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:04,227
It's about me

121
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:10,568
I promise I'll never stray again

122
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:13,647
But please don't abandon me

123
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:16,708
Whole night I kept awake & sang

124
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:36,627
Dewdrops in the eyes

125
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:43,236
Whole night I kept awake and sang

126
01:25:56,784 --> 01:26:03,348
Love like this cannot be extinguished

127
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:16,426
Like a torrent that cannot be dammed

128
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:49,732
Eyes filled to the brim

129
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:56,706
Whole night I kept awake & sang

130
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:16,495
Ties of the soul are eternal

131
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:23,033
Scars on the heart are indelible

132
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:36,583
The night was split
tossing and turning

133
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:43,087
Whole night I kept
awake and sang

134
01:27:43,324 --> 01:27:56,567
Dewdrops in the eyes

135
01:27:56,838 --> 01:28:03,107
Whole night I kept awake and sang

136
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:54,248
I'm a "Pathan" by birth but
I grew up in Delhi

137
01:31:15,703 --> 01:31:19,332
Well done my boy - Thank you

138
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
