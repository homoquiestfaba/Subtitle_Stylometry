00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:21,204
[Kai] Growing up, the Mount
Everest of big wave riding

3
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:22,606
was just down the street,

4
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:24,976
and Tai Alonzo
was leading the pack.

5
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:26,744
And I just wanted to be him.

6
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:28,378
He was like Superman to me.

7
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:29,981
[Doug] Tai was am atomic bomb,
man.

8
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:31,883
He blew up big time.

9
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:34,284
He was a bomb in the water,

10
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:37,955
and maybe too much of a bomb
on land, too.

11
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:39,691
[woman] The first time
I saw this image

12
00:00:39,724 --> 00:00:40,925
on the cover of a magazine,

13
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,760
I was like, "Oh, what is this?"

14
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:44,628
Like, it's this guy, like,

15
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:48,632
all like, tan and, you know,
there was a coconut tree behind.

16
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,267
Oh, my God! Like, I didn't know

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,869
that was existing, you know?

18
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:53,738
[Grandpa] The fame thing,
it just builds and builds

19
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:55,807
and everywhere you go,
it's just people wanting you.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,810
They want you to stand
with them at the beach.

21
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:00,712
They want to take you
out to dinner.

22
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:03,246
They want you to do something
because of the prestige

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,949
of being with you.

24
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,285
[Doug] You expect him to get
covers like <i>Surfer Magazine,</i>

25
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,722
but when he got <i>Time Magazine,</i>
no one could believe it.

26
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:13,557
[Kai] It's crazy how,
you know, sometimes

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,425
you can be the best ever,

28
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:17,729
but if you fly too close
to the sun,

29
00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:19,897
you're gonna get burned.
And that's it.

30
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:21,899
[Doug] You hear all kinds
of stories about

31
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:25,302
what ultimately led to his
getting booted from the tour.

32
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,606
But to me, it's...
it's just stories.

33
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,275
It's part of why he's a legend.

34
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:33,745
[Grandpa] You go climb
the mountain,

35
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:35,579
and you climb
the mountain, and eventually,

36
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:37,014
I mean, the mountain has a slope
going down the other side,

37
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:39,549
and there's a cliff
on the other side.

38
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,418
It appears that
he climbed the mountain,

39
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:43,386
turned around,
looked backwards, and fell over.

40
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,790
[Kai] You know, I don't know
what happened to Tai.

41
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:47,658
One day he was riding
the biggest waves,

42
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:49,593
he was winning
world championships,

43
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:51,294
he was on the cover
of magazines.

44
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:52,797
And then,
he sort of disappeared.

45
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,966
[saw whirring]

46
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:58,803
[Dean Hammer] Mr. Alonzo!

47
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:01,038
Mr. Alonzo!

48
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,007
[whirring stops]

49
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:09,479
Not cool! I was in the flow.

50
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,314
We need to have a word.

51
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:13,885
Meredith Hammer, your new
Dean of Student Affairs.

52
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:17,320
What, here to drop the hammer
on me?

53
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:19,891
I know, I began my new position
today, Mr. Alonzo.

54
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:23,694
Now, if you'll just follow
me into my office.

55
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:26,764
We can talk right here.
I got some choice papayas,

56
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:29,000
some apple bananas.

57
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:31,368
- Some mangoes somewhere.
- No, no.

58
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:32,870
My office, now.

59
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,373
Sister! Oh, I mean, Dean.
It don't have to be this way.

60
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:38,642
I'm just showing you some <i>aloha.</i>

61
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,411
I can tell she just landed.

62
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,047
Cuz, you better hurry up

63
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,817
before she calls up
some real cops and everything.

64
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:47,718
What you supposed to be?

65
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,720
Security.

66
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:51,022
[Dean] Now means today,
Mr. Alonzo.

67
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,025
[relaxed music]

68
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:06,103
It says here you've been
a student for 17 years.

69
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:08,973
Oh, yeah.
Unreal how much I've learned.

70
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,342
[chuckles] It's a scam.

71
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:14,411
Why you gotta say it like that?

72
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,814
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because you've taken

73
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:20,117
Introduction to Astronomy
for 21 semesters in a row.

74
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:24,521
Yeah, I dig the stars.
I'm on point. A minus student.

75
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:27,024
Yeah. And you're getting
a scholarship to be here.

76
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:28,092
100%.

77
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:30,061
100% what?

78
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:32,395
100% what, what?

79
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,667
Okay. What are we even
talking about right now?

80
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:40,403
Yeah, my girl Cheryl
in the financial aid department.

81
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:42,773
She's awesome.
Fill out all my paperwork.

82
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,041
Check all the boxes.

83
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:46,677
I don't know whether
you're aware, Mr. Alonzo,

84
00:03:46,711 --> 00:03:48,779
but this college is
now part of a national

85
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:50,882
accredited institution
of higher learning.

86
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:53,617
Yeah, I heard about that.

87
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,485
Offering legitimate
degree programs.

88
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:57,855
Perfect, then!
I'm the perfect student.

89
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,758
A minus, I would be
the perfect poster boy.

90
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,160
Nope. As of today,
your scholarship's cut off.

91
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:04,896
- What?
- Until I see you actually

92
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:06,664
progressing through
a degree program.

93
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:09,033
Unnecessary for being that way.

94
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,735
[groans]

95
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:12,770
You know what? Can't we just
maybe, you know,

96
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:14,805
do a whole do-over...

97
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:17,041
- We're finished for today.
- Press the reset button

98
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:18,876
- on the whole morning.
- No reset.

99
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:21,145
[sighs] So uncool.

100
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:25,783
Here, take this.

101
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,455
Maybe, just maybe, you might
reconsider to reconsider.

102
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:44,802
- [loud bang]
- Hey! That's my van!

103
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:46,603
That's where I stay!

104
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:47,872
[lively music]

105
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:49,674
Wait!

106
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:54,178
Wait!

107
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:01,618
Wait! Wait!

108
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:06,057
Wait!

109
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:14,665
Fuck! Right there!

110
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,934
That's my vehicle!
Why are you stealing my vehicle?

111
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:19,737
- I'm just doin' my job.
- That's where I live!

112
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:22,740
And that right there
is the board I'm shaping!

113
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:24,875
Campus police said you've been
out there six years

114
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,277
in a six-hour parking spot.

115
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,578
Who cares? Nobody counting!

116
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,748
That right there is my
daughter's birthday gift!

117
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,950
Look, man, you can come by
the yard a little later on

118
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:35,152
and pick it up, but you're gonna
have to pay the tow fee.

119
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:36,787
- How much?
- $500.

120
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,122
Plus the impound fee.

121
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:41,092
Cuz, me and you,
we'll cut one deal.

122
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:45,696
- I got like $80, maybe $73.
- [snorts]

123
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,665
But it's in the vehicle!

124
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:49,200
With my choice papayas!

125
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:51,902
[groans]

126
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,536
[weatherman] So basically,
the same as...

127
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,806
you know, yesterday,
and probably tomorrow.

128
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,640
And I'm gonna be honest
with you folks,

129
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:59,143
probably for the rest
of the month.

130
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,145
Let's take a look
at the satellite map.

131
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:04,982
Oh, wow! Would you look at that!
No precipitation. No clouds.

132
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:08,119
Steady daytime temperatures
of 85 degrees.

133
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:09,619
So whatever.

134
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:10,921
Back to you, Mahina.

135
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,757
- [Mahina] Thank you, Doug...
- Psst.

136
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,624
- ...for that in-depth report.
- How'd you get in here?

137
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,327
You suck as a weatherman.

138
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,662
Yeah. No doubt, brah. I hate it.

139
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:20,597
Besides, everyone just checks
their phones, anyway.

140
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,333
What's the point? The weather
on the island is the same

141
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:23,801
every single day.

142
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,202
Yeah, except
during hurricane season.

143
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:27,271
Oh, it's different then?
Thanks a lot, Tai.

144
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,173
- [Tai] Yeah.
- Guys, I'm on air.

145
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,574
What are you doing here?

146
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:33,077
Hey brah,
I need to borrow some cash.

147
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,179
No, no can. Martini has me
on a budget again.

148
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:36,914
I got kicked out of college.

149
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:38,315
Took my van, everything.

150
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:39,582
For real? How come?

151
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:41,584
Some dean from the mainland

152
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,187
with her panties in her bunches.

153
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,588
Wait, she had her panties
in a bunch?

154
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:47,658
You know what I mean!
She just snapped.

155
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,160
Kicked me out of her school.

156
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:51,594
[Doug] Sorry to hear that.
But maybe it's time

157
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,164
to pull the big boy pants on
like everyone else.

158
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:55,966
Brah, I've been wearing this
since 2001.

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
It's my lucky board shorts.

160
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:58,969
Maybe your luck's run out.

161
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:00,938
Or maybe, you know,
you strangled it,

162
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:03,140
- because you got too fat.
- [Mahina] Hey! Shh.

163
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:05,109
Guys, I'm live on the air.

164
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:07,945
So what's up?

165
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:11,148
All I need is $700 and 17 cents.

166
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:14,318
I'll pay my child support,
my car, and my food.

167
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,720
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Check this out.

168
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:19,223
Mahina. You did that story
on Nalu Ha'i Cottages, right?

169
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:21,258
- and what they're looking...
- Doug, I'm live on air.

170
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:24,128
For like two people. Take it
down a notch. But for real.

171
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:25,663
Come on. Weren't they looking

172
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,864
for a surf instructor
or something?

173
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:28,365
That was in my report.

174
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,633
- Yes.
- There you go.

175
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:31,836
Big boy pants time.

176
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,206
Here. Use my phone. Call 'em.

177
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:38,909
Hey! You guys!
I'm trying to report the news.

178
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,945
Can you please go?

179
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:43,247
I apologize to both of you.
[laughs]

180
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:54,992
[scoffs] Big boy pants.

181
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:57,928
[woman] Wasn't his lesson
supposed to start at 2:00?

182
00:07:57,962 --> 00:08:00,798
2:00 Hawaiian time means more
like 2:30.

183
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:03,767
- Okay. Well, it's almost 3:00.
- Exactly. Um...

184
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:05,870
He's down at the Coast Guard
checking on waves

185
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:06,937
and tidal conditions.

186
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:10,040
I think you should just
forget it, babe.

187
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,109
Are you kidding? We just
hired the best instructor

188
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:14,812
on the island. I mean,
you've probably heard of him.

189
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:16,046
Tai Alonzo?

190
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,149
Gonzo Alonzo.

191
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:20,718
You definitely don't want
to miss out.

192
00:08:21,986 --> 00:08:23,220
Do you really want to do this?

193
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,698
[whistles]

194
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:39,303
Woo-hoo!

195
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:41,272
[girls giggle]

196
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:45,476
- [man] You sure he's coming?
- Yeah. Totally. Um...

197
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,444
Why don't you guys head down
to the beach,

198
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:49,246
and get some sunscreen going.

199
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,015
You know, that might take
a while.

200
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:53,684
- Okay.
- [Kaila] Take your time.

201
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,887
Totally.

202
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:08,999
- What's up, sistah?
- [Kaila] Hoy! Over here.

203
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:11,402
- Woo!
- Over here. Tai.

204
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:15,439
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

205
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:17,241
Oh, my...

206
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:19,910
- Hey, how's it...
- You're here.

207
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:21,478
- I love your enthusiasm.
- No.

208
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:23,948
You were supposed to be here,
like, two hours ago.

209
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,916
- What is this?
- Employment documents.

210
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,452
Just sign it and get out there.
You have students waiting.

211
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,321
- I have students?
- Babymooners.

212
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:32,156
Babymooners?
What is that, babymooners?

213
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:34,458
They're pregnant. I guess that's
what people do now.

214
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,160
- They, like, surf?
- Just him.

215
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:38,429
But she's definitely the one
wearing the pants.

216
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:40,798
Hey, let me know
if you need pointers.

217
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,866
- I can help you.
- What are you talking about?

218
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,069
On the phone. You said you surf.
You, like, compete...

219
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:48,305
Nah, I'm good. Thanks.

220
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:51,308
Remember, the flip side of fear
is commitment.

221
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,377
That's a Laird Hamilton quote.

222
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,880
Not even!
We said that at the same time.

223
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,017
Okay.

224
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,221
Oh!

225
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:09,226
I'm loving those fierce warriors
I'm seeing this morning.

226
00:10:09,728 --> 00:10:13,297
Now, find that giggling newborn

227
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,100
as you ease into

228
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:20,104
ananda balasana.

229
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,141
[Tai] Oh, yeah. Looking good.

230
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,944
Happy baby pose.
That's my favorite.

231
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,113
Stay focused.

232
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:31,215
Stay with the plan.

233
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:36,987
And imagine me feeling each
and every one of you

234
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:40,291
with my life-giving manna.

235
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:42,226
If you're looking for
the real stuff,

236
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,928
hit me up for some surf lessons
at the beach.

237
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:46,864
They gonna be on point.

238
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:50,901
Oh, shotay, shotay, shotay.
Oh, shotay...

239
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:53,937
Ignore the infantile
and breathe.

240
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:58,175
Stay focused.
Fight through with the breath.

241
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,943
[inhales sharply]

242
00:10:59,977 --> 00:11:01,879
[exhales loudly]

243
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:05,349
Aloha, everybody. Coming at you

244
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:07,351
with today's daily rubber neck
surf check.

245
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:09,486
And the surf today,
oh, still pretty flat.

246
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,588
But gets some rogue waves
every now and then.

247
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:14,124
You better watch out,
Don't wanna get caught by them.

248
00:11:14,158 --> 00:11:16,093
Low tide at 8:00 a.m.

249
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:18,862
And high tide coming in
at 4:30 p.m.

250
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:21,565
That wraps it up for today's
rubber neck surf check.

251
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,135
[speaking Hawaiian]

252
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,617
Lose the booties,

253
00:11:40,652 --> 00:11:42,486
because we don't let nobody
know you're tourists.

254
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,355
I'm sorry, who are you again?

255
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:47,491
I usually tell my students
to lose the rashguard too.

256
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:50,294
YouReviewHawaii.com says
that there might be urchins

257
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:52,463
or coral heads out there.

258
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:54,598
Don't worry about that, sistah.
I get 'em.

259
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,134
This is my church.
This is my playground.

260
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,636
I know every inch of this place.

261
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:01,372
Uh, are you the guy
on the website?

262
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:03,374
What you looking at, brah? Huh?

263
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,677
It's just... she said
we'd be getting instruction

264
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,478
from an actual pro surfer.

265
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:11,215
You know Kelly Slater?
You know Laird Hamilton?

266
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:13,150
You know Andy Irons?
Dave Kalama?

267
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,985
- You know them?
- Yeah, of course, but...

268
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:16,420
Well, then, okay!

269
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:18,690
So you still compete, or...

270
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:21,492
- Ranked number three.
- Okay, you are ranked

271
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:24,094
number three, or you were ranked
number three?

272
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:27,331
Exactly. All right.
Let's go surfing! Come on!

273
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:30,167
<i>♪ Ride a wave, here we go ♪</i>

274
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,303
<i>♪ Ride a wave, here we go ♪</i>

275
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:36,206
Don't worry. Paddle out.
Looking good. Looking good.

276
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,076
- Keep paddling.
- You're doing great, babe.

277
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:40,577
Keep paddling out.

278
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:42,379
He's got a strong stroke.

279
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,047
You've got a strong stroke!

280
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:45,649
All right.

281
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,652
Go to the right
towards the peak.

282
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,420
That's right.
Paddle out to the peak.

283
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:51,021
Go to the right!

284
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:53,557
Right there! Keep going!

285
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,592
[woman] Paddle like
he showed you!

286
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:58,529
- Hey, let me see that.
- What?

287
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,631
What is it?

288
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:02,366
Holy!

289
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,502
Holy!

290
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,604
[woman] Oh, my gosh.
What's happening?

291
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:11,041
[Tai] Turn the board around!
Turn the board around!

292
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:14,712
Now paddle!
Paddle like I showed you!

293
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:17,247
Paddle like he showed you!

294
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:19,717
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Go! Go!

295
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:23,520
[screams, gurgles]

296
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,657
Swim to the light!

297
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,592
Do something!
I am not gonna be widow!

298
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:32,996
Martha! [screams]

299
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,199
Ah! Right there!

300
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,334
- [woman] Go get him!
- Yes! Good job!

301
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:40,404
[man groans]

302
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,510
Hoo! That was the real
stuff right there!

303
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:49,346
Not everybody gets to experience
that the first time!

304
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,515
The what? You almost killed him!

305
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:54,051
Yeah, but you will always
remember that.

306
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,254
[man] I think maybe I should
have worn the booties after all.

307
00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:00,257
Nah. Don't worry.
The best way to treat vana,

308
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,659
you gotta let me piss on 'em.

309
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:04,027
It will disinfect
and will push them out.

310
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:05,697
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, I drain coco water.

311
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,164
I take care of that.

312
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:09,566
- I just...
- Keep him right there.

313
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,736
[urinates]

314
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:16,073
The divinity within me
honors the divinity within you.

315
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,675
Namaste.

316
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:18,810
Oh.

317
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:20,544
- Nice work, coach.
- Brah.

318
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:23,180
Can't you see I'm in the middle
of a surf lesson?

319
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:25,582
As was I. A word, please?

320
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:28,519
- Let's go.
- Baby. Hi, baby.

321
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:30,722
You are forbidden to talk
to my students.

322
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:33,357
Not during class,
not outside of class.

323
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,359
- Not ever.
- [Tai] Forget that.

324
00:14:35,392 --> 00:14:37,194
This is where we start and end.

325
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:39,429
We've been surfing this spot
for hundreds of years.

326
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:42,432
And your loin cloth gymnastic
yoga, that's all new.

327
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:48,105
[laughs] Yoga has been around
for literally 10,000 years.

328
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,173
- So has your breath.
- What?

329
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:51,441
- And your BO.
- What?

330
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,811
- What, you deaf?
- My breath?

331
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:56,179
My breath is scented
with jasmine

332
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:58,348
from the Himalayan foothills.

333
00:14:58,382 --> 00:15:01,819
Brah, I don't even know your
name, but you make no sense.

334
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:05,255
- I make no sense?
- What? You deaf, too?

335
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:06,724
Try this on for scent.

336
00:15:07,457 --> 00:15:08,793

00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:11,061
[grunts, groans]

338
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:17,367
The peace of inner yoga
also has a name!

339
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:20,170
Hey! You're not even
wearing underwears!

340
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:21,471
My practice doesn't allow it.

341
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,308
- Whose breath is stinky now?
- [Tai] Get off me!

342
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,443
- [laughs]
- Come on! Get off me!

343
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:30,180
Diaper boy attacked me
out of nowhere.

344
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:31,783

00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:07,064
No, no, everything on the house.

516
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:12,002
I'm talking golf, surfing,
we have deep sea diving.

517
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:14,939
We can do, you ever did
paper, scissors, stone?

518
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:18,142
Huh? We got dot-to-dots,
Connect Four...

519
00:24:18,175 --> 00:24:21,011
All right. We'll try the yoga.
But no more surfing.

520
00:24:21,045 --> 00:24:22,246
- Ever.
- Okay.

521
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,347
- Okay.
- Yeah.

522
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,715
Come on.

523
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:31,222
So, you guys want me
to get your bags?

524
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:44,268
- You work here?
- Why? Who are you?

525
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:46,670
Are you or are you not employed
by this hotel?

526
00:24:46,704 --> 00:24:48,339
Brah, do I even know you?

527
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,108
Come on, man.
Just answer my question.

528
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:53,144
Why? You a cop? Fed?

529
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:56,380
Dude, that wasn't even here
this morning.

530
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:59,116
Oh, so you do work here.

531
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,086
What is this supposed
to even be?

532
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,321
I'll tell you what it is.
It's vulgar.

533
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:07,825
And it's a clear violation
of Code 14716527A

534
00:25:07,858 --> 00:25:10,327
of the Hotel and Recreation
Use Act of 2014.

535
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:13,397
Yeah, well, it looks like
somebody squatting

536
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,299
- and taking a dump.
- Come on, man.

537
00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:16,767
Yeah, because, look,

538
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,402
if you look good,
they're squatting,

539
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,171
and you get boom, boom.
[blows raspberry]

540
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:22,406
It's gonna cost the hotel
$1,000.

541
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,075
And it's gonna cost them $500

542
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:27,144
for each additional day
it's there.

543
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:30,714
Give that to your boss.

544
00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:34,218
It's a self-portrait of a guy,
that's what that is.

545
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:36,453
- Taking a dump.
- I heard that.

546
00:25:36,487 --> 00:25:40,224
Whoa. Like bionic ears
and stuff.

547
00:25:40,257 --> 00:25:42,259
- Whoa.
- I can still hear you!

548
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:43,894
[Moe] This thing's supposed
to be on top of the roof.

549
00:25:43,928 --> 00:25:45,029
I thought they were going
on the side.

550
00:25:45,062 --> 00:25:46,197
- Hey, boss.
- Yeah?

551
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,098
The county inspector came by.

552
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:50,234
They're gonna fine you because
of the graffiti on the wall.

553
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:51,902
Shoot, brah! I knew that guy.

554
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:53,971
He's gonna kill me
and make me <i>maki.</i>

555
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:55,239
I'm tellin' you, boss.
It's a scam.

556
00:25:55,272 --> 00:25:56,874
What are you talkin' about, Tai?

557
00:25:56,907 --> 00:25:58,342
I think they're trying
to squeeze you out.

558
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,010
Oh, brah,
I never think about that.

559
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:01,512
I didn't think about that one.

560
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:02,846
Hey boss, if you
need somebody for dig around,

561
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,481
I'm your dig around guy.

562
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:07,051
Okay, dig around guy,
I tell you what.

563
00:26:07,084 --> 00:26:09,286
You get any information,
and you got

564
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,021
another $20 for
you at payday. Okay?

565
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:12,923
Hey, boss,
I got another question.

566
00:26:12,957 --> 00:26:14,491
I know it's not
the right time, but...

567
00:26:14,525 --> 00:26:16,427
- <i>Qué? Qué?</i>
- You know my daughter, Alana?

568
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,796
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I get her one weekend

569
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,431
- for the whole month.
- Uh-huh.

570
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:22,433
She from the big island, boss.

571
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:24,468
And I was thinking, you know,

572
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,303
she usually stay with me

573
00:26:26,337 --> 00:26:27,938
- in my van.
- [hums]

574
00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:29,506
The van's in the shop and...

575
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,276
I'm looking around,
you got some vacancies.

576
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:34,378
You think you can hook her up
with a room?

577
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:39,250
Vacancies?

578
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:44,755
You pay, can can.
No pay, no can.

579
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:46,090
Let's go.

580
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,793
Do you know how to fix
solar panels?

581
00:26:49,827 --> 00:26:52,196
I did one installation
and I took a repair class

582
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:53,230
a couple years back.

583
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:55,165
If you can fix them...

584
00:26:55,734 --> 00:26:58,035
and repaint the wall
with the graffiti,

585
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:01,939
then, I'll throw in another $20
come payday.

586
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:04,308
Hey, uh, you think
I can get an advance?

587
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:06,977
[laughs]

588
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:08,979
Oh, also,
boss said you need to fill in

589
00:27:09,013 --> 00:27:10,814
for the tennis pro later today.

590
00:27:10,848 --> 00:27:12,283
A couple from China just booked.

591
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,418
[upbeat music]

592
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:31,235
Okay! Whenever you're ready!

593
00:27:31,502 --> 00:27:34,271
Let's warm up nice and slow.

594
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,876
[groans]

595
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:43,455
[speaking Chinese]
Typical American.

596
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,749
[speaking Chinese]
Fat and slow and too much talking.

597
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:49,320
[Tai] Good one! Good.
Plenty of power right there.

598
00:27:49,788 --> 00:27:53,023
Maybe we can work on your lobs,
like the real high ones.

599
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:57,428
No, no, no. My wife wants
to work on her first serve.

600
00:27:57,461 --> 00:27:59,997
It's most important part
of game.

601
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,100
All right. Okay.
Give me one minute.

602
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:05,069
[groans] Ow, my nutsack.

603
00:28:05,737 --> 00:28:08,939
No, no, no.
The first serve. The serve.

604
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:11,909
Yeah, well, this is how
I like to do it sometimes.

605
00:28:17,548 --> 00:28:20,050
[yells] Oh!

606
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:26,323
Hold on, sistah.
Not much I can teach you there.

607
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:28,625
I was thinkin' maybe...

608
00:28:29,593 --> 00:28:32,262
today, maybe tomorrow,

609
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:34,865
do a surfing lesson?

610
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,635
- Huh?
- Okay. But lob practice first.

611
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,238
Okay. Lob practice first.

612
00:28:42,005 --> 00:28:44,041
All right, then. Okay.

613
00:29:24,214 --> 00:29:26,150
[oinking]

614
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:28,619
What the hell is that?

615
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:32,956
Hey! No pigs in the water!

616
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,992
[squeals]

617
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,560
See the wave coming?

618
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:38,595
Right. Now, get up!
Come on, big boy! Get up!

619
00:29:38,629 --> 00:29:41,031
There you... Ah! No!

620
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:45,469
I see it. Fire of a champion.
I love the hunger.

621
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:47,971
Yeah. Surfing's my passion.

622
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:51,341
She placed third in a contest
in Manhattan Beach.

623
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,076
That's why I brought her
out here.

624
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,178
She said she wants

625
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:56,013
- to place first.
- Oh, yeah?

626
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:57,682
We're actually here 'cause
she just got divorced.

627
00:29:57,715 --> 00:29:59,550
- You shut it.
- Again.

628
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,285
I am warning you, Maya.

629
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:04,455
Thing is, I actually already
know how to surf.

630
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:08,091
- I really don't need a lesson.
- See, that's where you're wrong.

631
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:11,028
It doesn't matter
at what level you are,

632
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:13,765
everybody can improve.
Everybody.

633
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:16,099
Yeah, preach, preacher.

634
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:19,436
You better listen to this little
sermon, you hear me?

635
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:23,240
Yeah, I do, and I noticed
that he said everybody can.

636
00:30:23,273 --> 00:30:25,075
Maybe you should work on
yourself, Mom.

637
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:28,078
All right. All right. All right.
Hey, that's enough.

638
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:30,647
Hey, you know what?
You know how I calm down?

639
00:30:30,682 --> 00:30:33,317
- I jump in the water.
- Great. So I can paddle out?

640
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,053
Yeah. Go ahead.
we'll be out there in a second.

641
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,288
I'm gonna talk to your mom
a little bit, you know.

642
00:30:38,322 --> 00:30:40,524
- Go over the basics.
- Okay.

643
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:44,394
You got a good girl there.

644
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:47,130
She's a spoiled brat.
You see how she talks to me?

645
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:48,766
Well, you know how
teenagers are.

646
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:52,369
It's her father's fault.
He is a full-blown narcissist.

647
00:30:52,402 --> 00:30:54,638
Yeah, but you saw her do this.

648
00:30:54,672 --> 00:30:56,708
She understands
there's a higher power.

649
00:30:56,741 --> 00:31:00,077
Oh, she's just pretending to be
a good little Christian girl.

650
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,113
Really, she's vicious and cruel.
Don't trust her.

651
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:04,682
Oh, yeah?

652
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,551
- Question.
- Yeah?

653
00:31:08,318 --> 00:31:11,054
Do surf instructors
ever get lonely?

654
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:14,057
This is all new to me.

655
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,326
What If I told you...

656
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:22,099
that I like to give
really big...

657
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:24,702
- tips.
- [winces]

658
00:31:25,803 --> 00:31:27,705
You know, it just
came to me that,

659
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:30,507
you know the yoga instructor?
He's lonely.

660
00:31:30,975 --> 00:31:33,143
You know what I'm noticing
right now?

661
00:31:33,176 --> 00:31:35,646
I'm just really into
your skin color.

662
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,248
Hey, Tai. Over here real quick.

663
00:31:38,282 --> 00:31:40,617
Hey, that's my manager.

664
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:43,220
Hold on for a second.
I'll be right back.

665
00:31:43,788 --> 00:31:47,591
Okay, my little dirty
chai latte. I'll be waiting.

666
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:51,663
- No flirting with the guests.
- She called me chai latte.

667
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:53,665
Okay. No going back
to their rooms.

668
00:31:53,698 --> 00:31:57,134
- No hanky-panky in the bushes.
- You gotta be joking.

669
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,535
Why would I be joking?

670
00:31:58,569 --> 00:32:00,237
You seeing that action?

671
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,372
That was one hot,
vicious cougar,

672
00:32:02,406 --> 00:32:04,608
fangs out, she was going for it.

673
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:07,879
Okay. Point is,
you gotta stop screwing up.

674
00:32:07,912 --> 00:32:10,514
If occupancy rates drop more,
we're gonna get laid off.

675
00:32:10,547 --> 00:32:12,684
Well, good, maybe
more time for surf.

676
00:32:13,017 --> 00:32:14,686
I know that's how
you like to live,

677
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,721
but you can't expect the rest
of us to also.

678
00:32:16,754 --> 00:32:20,490
Used to be like that for me.
Prize money. Sponsorship.

679
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:21,859
But I wasn't happy.

680
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,261
And you are now?

681
00:32:27,164 --> 00:32:29,566
Look. I have the ocean.

682
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,102
I get my daughter once a month.

683
00:32:32,737 --> 00:32:35,205
Once a month?
And that's cool with you?

684
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:39,543
Seriously? You never wanted
to compete again

685
00:32:39,576 --> 00:32:41,578
after you got booted
from the tour?

686
00:32:41,612 --> 00:32:44,247
Doesn't it piss you off
to see all the other ex-pros

687
00:32:44,281 --> 00:32:46,818
with big houses
and endorsement deals?

688
00:32:48,452 --> 00:32:50,788
Okay. Well, I haven't had
my shot yet.

689
00:32:51,188 --> 00:32:54,625
I want to go pro.
But to do that takes money.

690
00:32:54,993 --> 00:32:57,427
- Well, get a sponsor.
- That's the thing.

691
00:32:57,795 --> 00:32:59,563
No one will sponsor me
unless I score big

692
00:32:59,596 --> 00:33:01,498
at one of the contests.
And to do that,

693
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:04,601
I have to have time to train.
Find a coach.

694
00:33:05,036 --> 00:33:07,204
Well, you don't have to worry
about a coach,

695
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:08,639
you got one right here.

696
00:33:08,673 --> 00:33:10,407
I've been doing this
for a long time.

697
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,743
Look how you ended up.

698
00:33:11,776 --> 00:33:13,610
- [cell phone rings]
- Oh. Shoot.

699
00:33:13,644 --> 00:33:15,913
I have to get back
to reception, but...

700
00:33:16,748 --> 00:33:19,884
just try to keep your
board shorts on, okay?

701
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:22,586
A hundred percent.
Rash guard, too.

702
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:23,620
Good.

703
00:33:33,865 --> 00:33:34,766
Look at you.

704
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,467
Hey! [laughs]

705
00:33:38,836 --> 00:33:42,339
- Oh. How was your flight?
- Good. Good.

706
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:44,976
So what? You actually have
a job now?

707
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:47,344
Yeah, surf instructor. But...

708
00:33:47,377 --> 00:33:49,546
you know, they got me doing
everything over here.

709
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:51,916
You know, I got cut off
at the college.

710
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,517
Cut off? How?

711
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,986
Yeah. You know that scholarship

712
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,854
that I was using
for my living expenses,

713
00:33:56,888 --> 00:33:59,891
- paying for your child support¿
- Mom said you're behind.

714
00:33:59,924 --> 00:34:02,626
- By like this much.
- Like, by three grand.

715
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,797
And she said if you don't pay
then I can't see you next month.

716
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,866
Hey, you know, I got a special
birthday gift for you.

717
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,702
I don't need anything, Dad.

718
00:34:10,735 --> 00:34:12,704
Just please pay her
what you owe her.

719
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,707
Hey, see that? That's your room.

720
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,641
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah. Don't get excited.

721
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:20,510
It's not the presidential suite
or anything like that,

722
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,280
but it's something, you know?

723
00:34:23,948 --> 00:34:25,717
Wow. It's nice.

724
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,819
Hey, by the way, how's Mom?

725
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:30,955
Why you looking at me like that?

726
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:32,522
Because you're looking at me
like that.

727
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:34,424
All puppy dog eyes.
Come on, Dad.

728
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,259
Your chances are not good.

729
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:37,594
Why not?

730
00:34:37,627 --> 00:34:39,329
Because you owe her
a lot of money.

731
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:42,265
And you already messed it up
like 150 times.

732
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:44,434
Yeah, you're right,
like your mom.

733
00:34:44,468 --> 00:34:46,771
Look, I have a lot
to do around here.

734
00:34:46,804 --> 00:34:49,639
I have to teach surf lessons.
Maybe teach a yoga class.

735
00:34:49,674 --> 00:34:51,809
Tennis. I gotta put up
solar panels.

736
00:34:51,843 --> 00:34:55,412
I gotta paint a wall.
Look, you hang out.

737
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:58,716
Go surf. Room service!
It's all yours.

738
00:34:59,117 --> 00:35:02,419
- Thanks, Dad. Love you.
- Love you, too. Come on.

739
00:35:02,452 --> 00:35:03,553
All right.

740
00:35:10,494 --> 00:35:12,864
[breathing heavily]

741
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,335
[moans]

742
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:21,505
Yo, brother.
Brother, I'm right here.

743
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:23,273
Right in front of you. Look.

744
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:28,913
No, no, no. No, no.
I got one quick question.

745
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:33,918
[hums]

746
00:35:33,951 --> 00:35:34,852
[thwack]

747
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:38,522
There. Now, you may speak.

748
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,524
All right.
You know those babymooners?

749
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:42,059
They're taking your classes
the whole week.

750
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:43,928
Wonderful, Tai. Thanks.

751
00:35:43,961 --> 00:35:45,462
Have them book with Kaila.

752
00:35:45,997 --> 00:35:48,032
Here's the deal.
You gotta do it for free

753
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,934
because that's the deal
I gave them.

754
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:51,601
So you will be paying, then.

755
00:35:51,635 --> 00:35:53,336
It's not for me,
it's for the hotel.

756
00:35:53,738 --> 00:35:56,007
I don't know, like,
they're super reviewers.

757
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,377
A bad review would be the result
of your pathetic lesson.

758
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,713
Come on, bro.
It's no cost to you.

759
00:36:03,014 --> 00:36:08,886
However, it would cost you $90
per person per session.

760
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,587
What? No more employee discount?

761
00:36:11,454 --> 00:36:13,423
Perhaps you didn't hear me.

762
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:18,395
Ninety dollars per person
per session.

763
00:36:18,896 --> 00:36:20,630
That accent, where are you from?

764
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,869
[exhales strongly]

765
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:29,774
[whistles]

766
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:33,010
Two words: breath mint.

767
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:35,378
Think about it.

768
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:55,867
[pig oinks]

769
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,702
Oh, it's you.
You here for the van?

770
00:36:57,735 --> 00:36:59,502
- Is that a...
- Yeah.

771
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:02,039
- It's a blue ribbon attack pig.
- Can I pet it?

772
00:37:02,073 --> 00:37:04,709
Go ahead. He might take
your arm off, though.

773
00:37:04,742 --> 00:37:05,710
For real?

774
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:09,080
- Nah, nah.
- Go ahead.

775
00:37:09,113 --> 00:37:11,414
Pet him. Sweetest creature
you'll ever meet.

776
00:37:11,448 --> 00:37:14,584
No, no. I'm good. Hey, look.
I got like $23 in my pocket,

777
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:17,088
and maybe, possibly,
$70 in my van.

778
00:37:17,121 --> 00:37:19,690
Look, tow bill alone
is $600, man.

779
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:22,093
- You told me it was $500.
- Inflation, man.

780
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:24,662
Plus, every night, man,
it goes up another $50.

781
00:37:24,695 --> 00:37:27,631
- Bro, why you gotta do this?
- Brah, I'm just doin' my job.

782
00:37:27,665 --> 00:37:29,432
You don't think
you can help me out?

783
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:31,769
Maybe put me on a payment plan,
like child support?

784
00:37:31,802 --> 00:37:34,005
Wish I could, man.
But I got bills to pay too.

785
00:37:34,038 --> 00:37:36,774
Thing is, bro, the vehicle
doesn't even run right now.

786
00:37:36,807 --> 00:37:39,143
Look, man, $400 is the best
I can do, brother.

787
00:37:39,844 --> 00:37:43,748
- I don't got it.
- Well, come back when you do.

788
00:37:43,781 --> 00:37:46,083
You think I can get
my daughter's surfboard?

789
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:55,059
[pig squeals]

790
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:15,913
- Hey.
- Hi.

791
00:38:18,182 --> 00:38:19,984
Hi, <i>aloha,</i> I'm Gina.
I'm in charge

792
00:38:20,017 --> 00:38:21,651
of sponsorship opportunities.

793
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:23,220
Well, thanks for meeting up
with me.

794
00:38:23,254 --> 00:38:26,589
Yeah. So who do you want
to pitch to me?

795
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:29,559
- Oh, we'll talk over here?
- Right, right here.

796
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:31,729
Oh, it's not for me.
It's for my student.

797
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:33,998
Kaila Vincent.
You guys gotta sponsor her.

798
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:36,767
- Okay. Is she ranked?
- Trust me.

799
00:38:36,801 --> 00:38:39,036
You gotta get in on the ground
floor with this one.

800
00:38:39,469 --> 00:38:41,504
Who are you again?

801
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,508
- You asking me that for real?
- Yeah. Yeah. Who are you?

802
00:38:46,277 --> 00:38:49,146
Sistah. Right there.
See there? Huh?

803
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,748
In the flesh.

804
00:38:51,682 --> 00:38:53,150
- Gonzo Alonzo?
- Yeah.

805
00:38:55,186 --> 00:38:57,288
Sorry. They said
you just fell off the radar.

806
00:38:57,321 --> 00:38:58,956
I'm back on it.

807
00:38:59,323 --> 00:39:01,624
- Come follow me.
- Shoot, sistah.

808
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,880
Okay. What you doing now,
you little perv?

809
00:39:23,314 --> 00:39:26,217
I see you. What you doing now?

810
00:39:52,676 --> 00:39:55,713
- Can I help you with something?
- Oh! Sorry!

811
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:57,715
This is where I usually
score my meth.

812
00:39:57,748 --> 00:40:00,084
- What, you the new drug dealer?
- You're joking, right?

813
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,053
Do I look like I'm joking?

814
00:40:02,086 --> 00:40:04,155
Do I look like a meth dealer
to you?

815
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:06,223
Do I look like a meth head
to you?

816
00:40:06,257 --> 00:40:10,294
You literally just said,
"This is where I score my meth."

817
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:13,197
All I'm saying is that
you could be a drug dealer.

818
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:18,969
Got him.

819
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:21,338
I'm telling you,
this whole thing stinks!

820
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:24,341
You find anything
on the license number?

821
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:26,844
Looks like it's registered
to Conquistador Club.

822
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:28,145
I knew it!

823
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:32,016
What?

824
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:34,118
Dad, you need to calm down.

825
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:36,253
No, Alana, this is wrong!

826
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:39,156
They're gonna shut this place
down so some donkey

827
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:42,359
from the mainland comes here,
build his hotels,

828
00:40:42,393 --> 00:40:45,196
so that they can mess up
the surf for everybody.

829
00:40:45,229 --> 00:40:49,033
No. This is not gonna be
like Waikiki.

830
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:50,968
So what are you gonna do
about it, Dad?

833
00:41:31,308 --> 00:41:33,410
- There you are, boss.
- Hey, brother, what's up?

834
00:41:33,444 --> 00:41:35,746
The inspector guy,
I think he's taking bribes.

835
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:37,314
For real?
I've heard that before.

836
00:41:37,348 --> 00:41:39,016
All them guys are taking bribes.

837
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:40,985
They're taking money
from the big hotel.

838
00:41:41,018 --> 00:41:43,187
Oh, man, I knew it. I knew it!

839
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,022
I'm gonna bust that guy.
You watch.

840
00:41:45,055 --> 00:41:46,757
Go ahead and bust him.
But I tell you what.

841
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,425
Take care of your
responsibilities around here.

842

You know, Christian <i>wahine.</i>

<i>Na ke Akua.</i> God bless them.
Everything's good.

844
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,733
- But they like what you did.
- For real?

845
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:58,435
She wants another one-on-one
lesson. Do 'em.

846
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:00,271
- For sure.
- For sure? Of course, for sure.

847
00:42:00,304 --> 00:42:02,106
'Cause I'm for sure,
you for sure.

848
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:03,807
You know how to fix toilets?

849
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:05,809
I took one year of plumbing.

850
00:42:05,843 --> 00:42:07,745
Oh! Guarantee you know how
to fix toilets.

851
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:10,014
You know this right here,
if I give you another $20

852
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,882
you can fix this toilet.
I'll give it to you on payday.

853
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:13,751
When is payday?

854
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:15,786
Next payday, I'm gonna give
you $20. You can handle?

855
00:42:15,819 --> 00:42:17,855
Well, you know about
this toilet right here?

856
00:42:17,888 --> 00:42:21,425
It's special. Elvis Presley
went [blows raspberry]

857
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,961
- right here in this toilet.
- Ugh.

858
00:42:23,994 --> 00:42:27,231
March 1966.

859
00:42:27,731 --> 00:42:29,300
- You know how to do it?
- Yeah.

860
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:31,302
[blows raspberry]
Help me up, brah.

861
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:33,003
Hey...

862
00:42:33,037 --> 00:42:35,439
Now, we turn, and we balance
on your left foot.

863
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:38,075
Stay focused.

864
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:41,912
And remember that the blessing
is your breath.

865
00:42:44,114 --> 00:42:46,417
No, you, in the back,
your left foot!

866
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,787
Left foot. Yeah, no.
This one, okay?

867
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,056
This one. Yeah. Okay.

868
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:54,258
All right. Get out of here.
Please, leave.

869
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:58,729
Now, roll it up like a burrito.
Burrito boy, roll it up.

870
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,865
Very good. Yeah.

871
00:43:01,899 --> 00:43:05,169
Indeed, yoga is not
for the crippled or the meek.

872
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:10,274
Okay? Now, your breath
is like your breastmilk.

873
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:16,914
It nourishes us in a cocoon
of lactose-free lactose.

874
00:43:17,348 --> 00:43:21,051
Okay. Oh, no, you don't.
Okay, everyone, take a break.

875
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:23,053
Yeah, take a water break.
Back in five.

876
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:25,322
- What are you doing?
- When's cat cow?

877
00:43:25,356 --> 00:43:28,259
- I like watching cat cow.
- What are you doing here?

878
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:30,227
The boss got you
on a special mission.

879
00:43:30,594 --> 00:43:32,496
Then why doesn't he come
ask me himself?

880
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:35,366
'Cause he cannot stand your
accent and your halitosis.

881
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,035
Okay, I respect that.

882
00:43:38,502 --> 00:43:41,105
- What is the mission?
- You know the lady in cabin six?

883
00:43:41,138 --> 00:43:42,506
She wants a one-on-one.

884
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:45,276
She wants to...
You know what I mean?

885
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:47,978
You know, she wants to see
what's inside your man diaper.

886
00:43:48,012 --> 00:43:49,847
She's got the hots for you.

887
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,915
- Really?
- Yeah!

888
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:54,251
Oh, yes. Yes, definitely.

889
00:43:54,285 --> 00:43:56,053
Of course, you know,
that makes sense.

890
00:43:56,086 --> 00:43:59,523
I felt our chakras resonating.

891
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:01,058
[laughs] Ooh, oh!

892
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:05,029
[grunts]

893
00:44:06,096 --> 00:44:08,832
Mm! [laughs]

894
00:44:08,866 --> 00:44:13,137
Okay. Do I look
like a beautiful man?

895
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,405
- Yeah. Yeah, go.
- Okay.

896
00:44:14,438 --> 00:44:16,073
- Yeah.
- All right.

897
00:44:16,106 --> 00:44:17,374
- Wish me luck.
- Okay.

898
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:19,510
- All right!
- All right! [babbles]

899
00:44:19,543 --> 00:44:21,378
Yeah! Go.

900
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:30,120
Okay. Come on, class.
Come on. Come on.

901
00:44:30,154 --> 00:44:33,223
I got something for you guys.
All right.

902
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:37,561
All right. I got a special pose.

903
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,997
It was developed right here
in the Islands.

904
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,099
It's called the urchin.

905
00:44:42,132 --> 00:44:45,135
Or sometimes,
the crouching vana.

906
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:52,543
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

907
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:55,245
Delivery for Kaila.

908
00:44:56,013 --> 00:44:59,416
- Sure. This is for me?
- Oh, that's, your name is Kaila?

909
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:02,119
- That's me.
- That's my grandmother's name.

910
00:45:02,152 --> 00:45:04,154
- Beautiful name.
- Thank you.

911
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:08,359
All right. Anything else?

912
00:45:08,392 --> 00:45:10,928
Oh, that's just the inventory.

913
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:17,301
- Uh... wow.
- This is the delivery.

914
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:20,137
Are you sure this is for me?

915
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,507
- Who sent this?
- Sticky, Stickybumps.

916
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,209
Last name. I don't know.
First name? I don't know.

917
00:45:25,242 --> 00:45:27,344
- Okay.
- [mumbles]

918
00:45:27,378 --> 00:45:29,346
What are you doing later?

919
00:45:29,781 --> 00:45:32,916
In life? Or later on tonight?
Either-or. Doesn't matter.

920
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,686
- I'm busy. Thank you.
- Okay. Okay.

921
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:36,420
- Have a great day.
- I'll be back.

922
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:38,288
I'll be back for this
hand truck tomorrow.

923
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:39,923
<i>Aloha.</i>

924
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:42,660
I won't be here.

925
00:45:43,627 --> 00:45:47,665
A field that has rested
gives a bountiful crop.

926
00:45:48,365 --> 00:45:50,033
Whatever you say.

927
00:45:50,067 --> 00:45:52,035
So I guess you know
what this is, then?

928
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:53,637
Stickybumps.

929
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:56,039
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

930
00:45:56,073 --> 00:45:59,009
It's a surprise.
You got sponsored!

931
00:45:59,042 --> 00:46:01,612
I mean, we did it together.

932
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:05,249
It's all just wax?

933
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:07,384
That's what they make.

934
00:46:07,786 --> 00:46:10,120
Well, I can't use all this.
I need cash.

935
00:46:10,154 --> 00:46:11,522
You gotta start some place.

936
00:46:12,322 --> 00:46:15,926
To me, this new stuff,
too fruity.

937
00:46:17,628 --> 00:46:19,029
It's not bad.

938
00:46:22,332 --> 00:46:24,435
- You see this right here?
- Oh.

939
00:46:24,468 --> 00:46:27,271
They don't make wax
like this anymore.

940
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:29,606
It's my special wax.

941
00:46:30,507 --> 00:46:32,976
Are you kidding me?
Move it, please.

942
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:35,979
This wax, I keep in my pocket

943
00:46:36,013 --> 00:46:39,316
ever since I beat Kelly Slater,
and I took the crown.

944
00:46:40,317 --> 00:46:42,586
This wax have <i>mana.</i>

945
00:46:44,455 --> 00:46:47,257
<i>Mana</i> that will win it for you.

946
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:48,459
Hmm.

947
00:46:50,527 --> 00:46:55,599
And that is why I wish
to pass this on to you.

948
00:46:55,632 --> 00:46:58,535
- Wow.
- Instructor to instructee.

949
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:01,472
[Kaila] Thank you.

950
00:47:07,511 --> 00:47:08,412
Ugh.

951
00:47:09,513 --> 00:47:11,982
Mission accomplished.

952
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:15,385
Mission accomplished, brah?
I have no idea

953
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:18,222
- what you're talkin' about.
- Cottage six is booked

954
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:20,324
for another week,
at the minimum.

955
00:47:20,758 --> 00:47:22,359
Oh, okay. Well, that's good.

956
00:47:22,392 --> 00:47:24,261
They probably liked
Tai's lesson.

957
00:47:24,294 --> 00:47:27,397
No, it was I. Not Tai.

958
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:29,066
- It was you?
- Yeah, man.

959
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:33,403
Okay, well, they happy,
you happy, everybody's happy.

960
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:36,106
- <i>Mahalo.</i>
- [laughs] <i>Mahalo.</i>

961
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:39,276
<i>Aloha. Malama pono.</i>

962
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:42,045
<i>Malama pono.</i> Yeah.

963
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,046
[Shiv] Okay, then.

964
00:47:43,681 --> 00:47:48,151
Well... [speaking in Hawaiian]

965
00:47:51,488 --> 00:47:52,790
<i>Mahalo,</i> then.

966
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:57,628
And for the record,
I myself am ecstatic.

967
00:47:57,662 --> 00:47:59,396
- [laughs]
- Oh, that's good, brah.

968
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:00,597
Happy for you.

969
00:48:01,098 --> 00:48:04,301
Yes, because I'm in love.

970
00:48:05,703 --> 00:48:08,505
Love. Great, brah.

971
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:11,208
- Love is a wonderful thing.
- I know. I know.

972
00:48:11,241 --> 00:48:14,411
And furthermore,
she is in love with me.

973
00:48:16,681 --> 00:48:19,082
- She's in love with you?
- Mm-hmm.

974
00:48:19,449 --> 00:48:22,720
- The lady in six? The mom?
- Yes. Mm-hmm.

975
00:48:23,387 --> 00:48:25,556
She's a bit older,
but it's cool.

976
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:27,558
We have a mutual understanding.

977
00:48:27,591 --> 00:48:30,828
She actually said this to you,
she was in love with you?

978
00:48:30,862 --> 00:48:33,196
She did not say it
with her lips, my friend.

979
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,498
[laughs]

980
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:36,768
She said it
with her pindink-ioni.

981
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:40,571
- Pinka-dinka-oni.
- Yeah.

982
00:48:40,604 --> 00:48:44,374
And she impindinka
await my return, so...

983
00:48:45,777 --> 00:48:49,179
Good talk. Okay. Bye.

984
00:49:01,558 --> 00:49:04,261
[screams]

985
00:49:05,162 --> 00:49:09,232
[laughs] Yeah! My trap worked!

986
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:12,536
So it was you
that would tag the walls.

987
00:49:12,937 --> 00:49:13,905
Release me!

988
00:49:13,938 --> 00:49:15,505
So it was or wasn't you

989
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:17,207
that would spray graffiti
on the walls?

990
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,843
Release me at once!
I command you!

991
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:20,912
So, are you claiming
you never tagged the wall?

992
00:49:20,945 --> 00:49:22,780
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

993
00:49:22,814 --> 00:49:25,148
But if you don't get me out
of this immediately,

994
00:49:25,182 --> 00:49:26,516
I'll be forced to use

995
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,452
my kalaripayuttu skills
on you again.

996
00:49:28,485 --> 00:49:31,154
- Just answer my question.
- Release me at once!

997
00:49:31,188 --> 00:49:32,857
All right, look.
I'll release you, but...

998
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,359
Kalaripayuttu is known
to be lethal.

999
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:37,494
I'm not taking you off
my suspect list.

1000
00:49:37,527 --> 00:49:38,562
There you go.

1001
00:49:38,963 --> 00:49:40,597
Get up.

1002
00:49:47,872 --> 00:49:49,172
My Pindinka awaits.

1003
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:52,309
And I sense that
she is not always patient.

1004
00:49:52,744 --> 00:49:54,378
Cool.

1005
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:56,948
You go handle Padinka.
Hey, I'm watching you.

1006
00:49:56,981 --> 00:49:59,383
- I'll be watching you.
- I'm gonna be watching you.

1007
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:01,418
- I'll be watching you.
- I'll be watching you.

1008
00:50:01,451 --> 00:50:03,220
- You.
- I'll be watching you.

1009
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,422
- I'll be watching you.
- You.

1010
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,229
Yes! Yeah!

1011
00:50:12,897 --> 00:50:15,933
Deep bottom turn.
Kisses the lip.

1012
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:18,703
Boom! Perfect ten!

1013
00:50:18,736 --> 00:50:22,272
Oh! She gonna be a champ!
Hey, you should get in there.

1014
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,475
- I don't have a board.
- Use mine!

1015
00:50:26,711 --> 00:50:27,779
What's the matter?

1016
00:50:29,013 --> 00:50:30,614
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?

1017
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:32,917
You can come live with me.

1018
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:35,285
- For high school.
- In your van?

1019
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,789
Nah, I can get us an apartment.

1020
00:50:38,188 --> 00:50:40,590
- Get rid of the van. For you.
- [phone ringing]

1021
00:50:40,992 --> 00:50:42,894
- Mom.
- Oh. Don't answer that.

1022
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:44,428
She's gonna ask for money.

1023
00:50:45,897 --> 00:50:48,231
Hey, tell her I'm working on it.

1024
00:50:48,265 --> 00:50:49,667
- [Alana] Hey, Mom.
- Tell her I'm working,

1025
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:51,334
I'm working really hard on it.

1026
00:51:00,745 --> 00:51:02,880
That's my student.
I'm her coach.

1027
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,483
- Qualifiers next week.
- You? Her coach?

1028
00:51:06,784 --> 00:51:11,723
100%. Hey, remember,
we all equals before a wave.

1029
00:51:11,756 --> 00:51:14,424
- Who said these words?
- I just did.

1030
00:51:16,293 --> 00:51:18,896
- What do you mean?
- What does it mean to you?

1031
00:51:23,633 --> 00:51:27,772
My wife said it was
Laird Hamilton

1032
00:51:27,805 --> 00:51:28,840
who said these words.

1033
00:51:28,873 --> 00:51:30,574
That guy's a freakin' liar.

1034
00:51:30,607 --> 00:51:32,944
I just Googled, no lie.

1035
00:51:32,977 --> 00:51:34,946
Yeah, well, let me see
what your Google say.

1036
00:51:35,278 --> 00:51:36,748
Let me see.

1037
00:51:38,548 --> 00:51:41,351
Google said that
[yells incomprehensibly].

1038
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,388
[yells] [speaking in Chinese]

1039
00:51:45,422 --> 00:51:47,557
Look, hey. The thing is,

1040
00:51:47,591 --> 00:51:50,460
you cannot believe
what the internet says.

1041
00:51:50,494 --> 00:51:51,863
Especially here in the U.S.

1042
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:54,832
The guy, Laird Hamilton,
is a thief!

1043
00:51:54,866 --> 00:51:57,400
He stole half the things
I said and did!

1044
00:51:57,434 --> 00:52:00,604
The big picture is that cell
phones are rotting your brain!

1045
00:52:00,637 --> 00:52:03,975
No critical thinking.
You should be surfing.

1046
00:52:04,008 --> 00:52:06,409
Instead of taking selfies
all day and all night.

1047
00:52:06,443 --> 00:52:09,346
Hey! You gotta watch
the placement on your back foot.

1048
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:12,016
On the drop, you gotta watch
the placement of your back foot.

1049
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:15,019
A couple more inches up front,
you'll be a lot more powerful.

1050
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:17,688
- Sounds good, coach.
- How's my special act?

1051
00:52:17,722 --> 00:52:19,824
- Working it?
- [speaking in Chinese]

1052
00:52:19,857 --> 00:52:22,894
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, we're just talking.

1053
00:52:22,927 --> 00:52:25,930
Good session.
I gotta go for my evening dip.

1054
00:52:25,963 --> 00:52:27,932
Maybe find some lobster
for dinner.

1055
00:52:27,965 --> 00:52:30,067
Or people's cell phones.

1056
00:52:30,101 --> 00:52:33,637
- Hey, boy. Come here.
- [Tai] I'm comin'.

with me, okay?

1063
00:53:06,503 --> 00:53:08,605
Say-hoo! Okay?

1064
00:53:09,006 --> 00:53:10,942

- [gong rings]
- [cheers, applause]

1070
00:53:30,761 --> 00:53:32,897
This next song
I would like to play

1071
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:36,701
comes straight from the heart.
Kind of tugs at me sometimes.

1072
00:53:36,734 --> 00:53:39,536

- Makes no sense.
- Tell me about it.

1109
00:56:23,267 --> 00:56:25,169
They're the ones acting
like little kids.

1110
00:56:25,202 --> 00:56:27,671
Worse. I mean, my mom hits on
everything that moves.

1111
00:56:27,705 --> 00:56:29,639
It's disgusting.

1112
00:56:29,673 --> 00:56:32,877
Oh, yeah? This is the first job
my dad has had in forever.

1113

And I don't think
he's gonna have it long.

1114
00:56:35,112 --> 00:56:37,782
I even saw him trying
to teach yoga.

And they're the ones always
telling us how to act.

- Now, what?
- It wasn't my idea.

Take your mask off.

1123
00:57:14,919 --> 00:57:16,887
No way.

1124
00:57:16,921 --> 00:57:21,725
Second violation, $1,500
by tomorrow morning.

1125
00:57:21,759 --> 00:57:23,626
So how much you pay the kid
to do that?

1126
00:57:23,661 --> 00:57:25,729
- Excuse me?
- Come on, man.

1127

Same thing every day.
When are you gonna get creative?

1128
00:57:28,432 --> 00:57:30,334
Don't think I can't see through
your scam.

1129
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,403
I recommend you watch yourself.

1130
00:57:32,436 --> 00:57:35,339
What you gonna do? Hit me
with your county clipboard?

1131
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:38,742
Oh, no, let me see.
You're writing chapter three

1132
00:57:38,776 --> 00:57:41,011
of your book how you sold out
the Hawaiian Islands.

1133
00:57:41,045 --> 00:57:42,146
Don't think I never see you

1134
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:43,747

1135
00:57:43,781 --> 00:57:45,316

$5 grand or one year in prison.

1141
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:02,766
Okay. <i>Mahalo.</i>
So we'll see you next week.

1142
00:58:03,467 --> 00:58:05,736
Okay. <i>Aloha.</i>

1143
00:58:06,737 --> 00:58:08,873
You sold my poster.

1144
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:11,809
I know I'm probably late
for something.

1145
00:58:11,842 --> 00:58:14,211
Okay, so someone from
the college called for you.

1146
00:58:14,245 --> 00:58:17,014
A Dean Hammer? She wanted you
to stop by her office.

1147
00:58:17,047 --> 00:58:18,916
- Why?
- Didn't say.

1148
00:58:20,217 --> 00:58:22,686
She wants to give me back
my scholarship?

1149
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,421
She didn't say.

1150
00:58:24,455 --> 00:58:28,425
- What, it's selling?
- Made like $8 so far.

1151
00:58:28,459 --> 00:58:31,228
Like, yeah, you'd have to pay
for a surf coach.

1152
00:58:31,262 --> 00:58:33,364
- Yeah, thanks.
- Hey.

1153
00:58:33,397 --> 00:58:36,200
It's not tragic
doing something you love.

1154
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:38,202
Yeah, okay.
Also, you make no sense.

1155
00:58:38,235 --> 00:58:40,304
And you gotta stop using
other surfer's quotes

1156
00:58:40,337 --> 00:58:42,973
- like they're yours.
- Oh, sorry.

1157
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:46,944
Whatever. Don't forget
to call Dean Hammer back.

1158
00:58:48,045 --> 00:58:50,381
And remember,
if you're a hammer,

1159
00:58:50,414 --> 00:58:52,416
you tend to see all the problems

1160
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:55,753
as a nail. [clucks tongue]
Okay, I gotta go.

1161
00:58:56,921 --> 00:58:59,323
If I'm a hammer...

1162
00:59:04,895 --> 00:59:07,331
Hey. Where are you going?

1163
00:59:07,364 --> 00:59:09,166
- Home.
- What?

[car door closes]

1165
00:59:12,002 --> 00:59:13,337
Hey, what you doing here?

1166
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:15,172
She's not even
supposed to be here.

1167
00:59:15,206 --> 00:59:17,141
I told her she couldn't come,
but she came.

1168
00:59:18,108 --> 00:59:19,376
Is that true?

1169
00:59:22,947 --> 00:59:25,249
Do you really think
I want to be doing this, Tai?

1170
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:27,952
Be the bitchy ex?
I got bills too.

1171
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:31,322
No, things at the college
are changing. I...

1172
00:59:31,355 --> 00:59:33,791
Things change all the frickin'
time, for everybody.

1173
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:35,826
Brotha, you gotta grow up
already.

1174
00:59:38,095 --> 00:59:39,964
This is from Family Court.

1175
00:59:39,997 --> 00:59:42,766
If you don't pay it,
you don't get to see her.

1176
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,268
Simple.

1177
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:49,840
Alana, I promise,
I'm gonna fix this.

1178
00:59:49,873 --> 00:59:51,809
I'm gonna make
everything good. Hey.

1179
00:59:52,309 --> 00:59:55,145
Don't forget, I got that
birthday gift for you, okay?

1180
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:57,414
Tai. Please put it in the mail.

1181
00:59:57,848 --> 01:00:00,351
'Cause if you show up
and you haven't paid,

1182
01:00:00,384 --> 01:00:02,286
I really don't want
to have you arrested.

1183
01:00:07,057 --> 01:00:09,226
[Dean Hammer] I may have
underestimated you.

1184
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:12,296
And I definitely
underestimated you!

1185
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:14,531
And how you messed things up
for me and my family.

1186
01:00:14,565 --> 01:00:17,768
I'm sorry. The thing is...

1187
01:00:18,402 --> 01:00:21,939
I looked back
over your file. Okay?

1188
01:00:22,506 --> 01:00:25,876
Prior to taking Astronomy 101
for 21 semesters in a row,

1189
01:00:26,377 --> 01:00:28,846
you actually took
a wide variety of courses

1190
01:00:28,879 --> 01:00:30,914
in a wide variety
of disciplines.

1191
01:00:30,948 --> 01:00:33,083
Yeah, except math.
I don't dig math.

1192
01:00:33,117 --> 01:00:36,520
Oh! You see, that's exactly why
I called you in here today.

1193
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:41,191
This is precisely about digging
or not digging math.

1194
01:00:41,225 --> 01:00:45,029
Yeah, well, you know it's just
if you was a guy,

1195
01:00:45,062 --> 01:00:47,231
I would want to kick your ass
right now.

1196
01:00:47,264 --> 01:00:50,901
But I'm digging the new look.

1197
01:00:50,934 --> 01:00:53,904
Yeah, the blouse. Your hair.

1198
01:00:53,937 --> 01:00:58,242
The plumeria in your ear.
Wow! Looking sharp.

1199
01:00:58,275 --> 01:01:01,178
Real sharp.
Look, you're wearing slippers.

1200
01:01:01,211 --> 01:01:03,914
I'm digging the whole
tropical makeover.

1201
01:01:03,947 --> 01:01:07,618
Now, all you have to do
is wear that with some <i>aloha</i>

1202
01:01:07,651 --> 01:01:10,220
instead of the mainland
attitude.

1203
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:13,390
Okay. So the reason
I called you here today,

1204
01:01:14,058 --> 01:01:16,360
if you could complete just one
math credit,

1205
01:01:16,393 --> 01:01:19,063
you would actually have
your associate's degree

1206
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:20,931
in several
different disciplines.

1207
01:01:20,964 --> 01:01:24,134
Nah, no need. Math isn't for me.

1208
01:01:24,168 --> 01:01:26,904
You could even
take the course online.

1209
01:01:26,937 --> 01:01:29,073
It would really help
your job prospects.

1210
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:30,607
Nah, I'm good.

1211
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:33,277
Please, just think about it.

1212
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:36,146
We want to see our students
actually graduate.

1213
01:01:36,647 --> 01:01:38,382
It's the key to our success
as well.

1214
01:01:38,415 --> 01:01:42,086
Please, just, you're so close.

1215
01:01:43,487 --> 01:01:45,055
Okay.

1216
01:01:54,098 --> 01:01:55,432
[oinks]

1217
01:02:05,075 --> 01:02:06,443
[strains]

1218
01:02:10,514 --> 01:02:12,249
[groans]

1219
01:02:13,217 --> 01:02:15,886
- [squeals]
- No! No! No!

1220
01:02:16,553 --> 01:02:18,956
[screams]

1221
01:02:20,257 --> 01:02:23,026
[squeals]

1222
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,163
[yells]

1223
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:37,007
Hey, little man. Come up
with that five grand yet?

1224
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,042
What, you surf?
Would you like a surf lesson?

1225
01:02:39,076 --> 01:02:40,978
- Excuse me?
- Huh? On the house.

1226
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:43,313
- That's not how citations work.
- For real. For free!

1227
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:46,150
On the house, brah. On me.
What? [shouts]

1228
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:48,352
- [yells]
- I already boogie board.

1229
01:02:48,887 --> 01:02:51,221
Tai, boss wants a word
in the office.

1230
01:02:53,624 --> 01:02:55,426
Hey, brah, where's Shivy Pupu?

1231
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,028
I haven't seen Diaper Boy
in a few days.

1232
01:02:58,061 --> 01:03:00,732
Yeah, he missed his Awakening
your Magma class yesterday.

1233
01:03:00,765 --> 01:03:04,501
And maybe the day before, too,
now that I think about it.

1234
01:03:06,136 --> 01:03:08,706
You know I avoid that fool
at all costs.

1235
01:03:10,742 --> 01:03:13,477
Okay, we're gonna go
with this meeting without him.

1236
01:03:14,578 --> 01:03:15,979
I, uh...

1237
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:18,615
I got some really sad news.

1238
01:03:21,251 --> 01:03:22,653
They're gonna
shut us down, brah.

1239
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:26,390
Something that existed
before the county.

1240
01:03:26,423 --> 01:03:29,460
Something that existed
before there was a state.

1241
01:03:29,493 --> 01:03:32,196
[sighs] Something that existed

1242
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:35,733
before they stole the Hawaiian
lands from our people.

1243
01:03:35,767 --> 01:03:38,068
What? Why?

1244
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:41,238
'Cause I can't pay
the fines, brah.

1245
01:03:41,605 --> 01:03:44,141
The graffiti thing
that was on the wall.

1246
01:03:45,042 --> 01:03:46,176
That was number eight.

1247
01:03:46,878 --> 01:03:50,080
Then they said something
about the cottages,

1248
01:03:50,113 --> 01:03:52,750
the zoning is not working.

1249
01:03:54,451 --> 01:03:57,488
Oh. We got 48 hours, brah.

1250
01:03:57,956 --> 01:04:00,658
- There's nothing we can do?
- Like what?

1251
01:04:00,692 --> 01:04:02,626
I don't know. Take a pay cut?

1252
01:04:02,993 --> 01:04:05,429
You know, I really wanted
to pay all you guys,

1253
01:04:05,462 --> 01:04:07,564
but that bank froze my accounts

1254
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:11,401
until I can make everything
right with the county.

1255
01:04:11,435 --> 01:04:14,104
Wait, so we're not gonna get
paid for the last two weeks?

1256
01:04:14,137 --> 01:04:16,273
No guarantee, my friend.

1257
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:18,542
Maybe you could go ahead

1258
01:04:18,575 --> 01:04:21,111
and teach the yoga class,
brah, for tips.

1259
01:04:21,478 --> 01:04:23,213
I mean, I would really like,

1260
01:04:23,247 --> 01:04:25,649
and I hope you guys would really
like that these guests

1261
01:04:25,683 --> 01:04:29,052
get one last <i>mahalo nui.</i>

1262
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,122
One last <i>aloha</i> from us.

1263
01:04:32,155 --> 01:04:37,160
Wait. So you let me teach yoga.
What about Moe?

1264
01:04:38,195 --> 01:04:40,397
What 'bout Moe? Let's go.

1265
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:41,733
[scoffs]

1266
01:04:45,803 --> 01:04:47,538
[Tai] You know,
in the positive column,

1267
01:04:47,571 --> 01:04:49,841
you can I can train together
really hard.

1268
01:04:49,874 --> 01:04:51,809
'Cause you gotta win
this surf contest.

1269
01:04:51,843 --> 01:04:54,311
- Not happening.
- What are you talkin' about?

1270
01:04:54,712 --> 01:04:56,547
It's just a stupid pipe dream.

1271
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:59,650
I started too late. I should
have already won juniors by now.

1272
01:04:59,684 --> 01:05:02,553
What are you talking about?
You got all the skills!

1273
01:05:02,586 --> 01:05:05,589
Right now, it's the best time
to be a female pro.

1274
01:05:05,622 --> 01:05:07,591
You know what?
It's actually better this way.

1275
01:05:07,624 --> 01:05:09,526
My aunt in Vegas has been
trying to get me

1276
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,730
to move out forever. And she
could hook me up with a job.

1277
01:05:12,764 --> 01:05:13,831
And I'd be set.

1278
01:05:13,865 --> 01:05:16,066
We gotta do this one last one.

1279
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,435
I've already decided, Tai.

1280
01:05:18,468 --> 01:05:20,537
Taking this job,
and thinking I can make it

1281
01:05:20,571 --> 01:05:22,774
on the Pro Tour
was a stupid idea.

1282
01:05:22,807 --> 01:05:25,242
I got a sponsorship
and everything.

1283
01:05:25,275 --> 01:05:27,444
Free wax? Come on!

1284
01:05:28,612 --> 01:05:30,614
No. I'm booking my ticket
tonight.

1285
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:34,484
What's that?

1286
01:05:36,653 --> 01:05:37,855
This?

1287
01:05:39,924 --> 01:05:41,625
- Don't worry about it.
- Hey!

1288
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,294
Thanks for coaching me.

1289
01:06:01,178 --> 01:06:04,348
Hey! You should have let me
piss on his leg

1290
01:06:04,381 --> 01:06:05,683
when you had the chance.

1291
01:06:13,557 --> 01:06:15,827
The infection spread
all the way up to his knee.

1292
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,829
We're just now getting back
from the ER.

1293
01:06:17,862 --> 01:06:20,698
Hey, look, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

1294
01:06:20,732 --> 01:06:22,800
No, it's too late.
The babymoon is over.

1295
01:06:25,703 --> 01:06:27,137
Are those good?

1296
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:29,674
Come, sit down.

1297
01:06:34,277 --> 01:06:36,413
So take a look at me
for a second.

1298
01:06:36,981 --> 01:06:39,650
I'm, like, maybe 43 years old.

1299
01:06:39,684 --> 01:06:41,418
Got kicked off the Pro Tour.

1300
01:06:41,786 --> 01:06:45,355
I messed it up with the one lady
that I really love.

1301
01:06:45,389 --> 01:06:47,257
And I get my daughter
one weekend

1302
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:49,226
out of the whole month.

1303
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:51,395
And even that might be ending.

1304
01:06:51,796 --> 01:06:53,731
And now, the hotel's
getting shut down.

1305
01:06:54,132 --> 01:06:56,600
- What?
- The county inspector came.

1306
01:06:56,633 --> 01:06:58,903
- Shutting us down.
- Why?

1307
01:06:59,369 --> 01:07:02,774
Some big developer gonna come,
tear this place down,

1308
01:07:02,807 --> 01:07:04,274
and put up a big resort.

1309
01:07:04,876 --> 01:07:08,245
And you're just gonna sit here
and stuff your face?

1310
01:07:09,914 --> 01:07:12,582
[laughs] You're like
a cautionary tale.

1311
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,919
- I heard that one before.
- [laughs]

1312
01:07:15,485 --> 01:07:17,989
You know, it's like that
half glass full,

1313
01:07:18,022 --> 01:07:19,791
half glass empty thing.

1314
01:07:19,824 --> 01:07:22,459
You know, I'm in Hawaii
with the man I love.

1315
01:07:22,492 --> 01:07:26,396
Pregnant. Weather in Portland
is sleeting, like 13 degrees.

1316
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:28,365
- Exactly!
- You know.

1317
01:07:28,398 --> 01:07:30,600
And I get to meet people
like you.

1318
01:07:30,902 --> 01:07:32,302
You know, real people.

1319
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:35,773
Not those fake,
smiling concierges.

1320
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:39,309
Or the <i>aloha, maholo, aloha</i>
maids at the big resorts.

1321
01:07:39,342 --> 01:07:42,612
I'm talking about real people.

1322
01:07:42,646 --> 01:07:44,614
I know what
you're talking about.

1323
01:07:44,648 --> 01:07:47,451
You know, the kind of people
that aren't afraid to show that

1324
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:50,688
they resent you for trampling
all over their paradise.

1325
01:07:56,694 --> 01:08:00,665
Or show you a little <i>aloha</i>
if that's what they're feeling.

1326
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:03,300
[laughs]

1327
01:08:06,037 --> 01:08:07,972
And that's the thing, Tai.

1328
01:08:08,572 --> 01:08:11,274
They shouldn't tear
this place down.

1329
01:08:11,308 --> 01:08:14,011
This is an authentic experience
we're having.

1330
01:08:14,045 --> 01:08:16,546
Yeah. This hotel has been
in the family

1331
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:18,281
for almost 200 years!

1332
01:08:18,648 --> 01:08:20,818
Well, then, why are you
just sitting there!

1333
01:08:21,384 --> 01:08:23,755
When you're down
in a surf competition,

1334
01:08:23,788 --> 01:08:26,623
did you just paddle in?
Or throw in the towel?

1335
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:28,993
No. I never owned a towel.

1336
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:31,896
Damn right you didn't!
It's the same thing here.

1337
01:08:33,731 --> 01:08:36,299
You gotta fight for this place.
Come on.

1338
01:08:36,768 --> 01:08:38,602
- Let's go!
- Hustle.

1339
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:42,506
As if there was a point
to any of this,

1340
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:43,540
let's check the radar.

1341
01:08:43,573 --> 01:08:45,042
Oh, boy. There it is.

1342
01:08:45,076 --> 01:08:47,577
Daily temperatures
of 84 degrees.

1343
01:08:47,611 --> 01:08:49,412
Let's see if there's
any precipitation.

1344
01:08:49,446 --> 01:08:51,716
Nope. And not a cloud
in the sky.

1345
01:08:51,749 --> 01:08:53,951
I don't even have to look at
that when I know there's none.

1346
01:08:53,985 --> 01:08:55,887
And that's about it
from here in weather.

1347
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,588
So sending it right back
to you, Mahina.

1348
01:08:58,622 --> 01:09:01,424
Psst. Dougie! Dougie.

1349
01:09:05,797 --> 01:09:08,666
Brah, amazing how bad you suck.

1350
01:09:08,699 --> 01:09:10,868
I know. To be honest with you,

1351
01:09:10,902 --> 01:09:13,436
sometimes I feel like
I want to off myself on air.

1352
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:16,473
Dude, forget that.
Hey, didn't you tell me one time

1353
01:09:16,506 --> 01:09:19,342
you wanted to be like a big,
investigative reporter?

1354
01:09:19,777 --> 01:09:21,378
Maybe in high school.

1355
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:23,080
Brah, I got the perfect case
you can crack!

1356
01:09:23,114 --> 01:09:24,648
We're gonna blow this thing up!

1357
01:09:24,682 --> 01:09:26,684
Do I look like I'm gonna
blow anything up?

1358
01:09:26,717 --> 01:09:28,920
Brah, plus the way
you're doing weather,

1359
01:09:28,953 --> 01:09:30,855
you're either gonna get fired,
or you're gonna look

1360
01:09:30,888 --> 01:09:32,455
just like that guy right there.

1361
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:34,725
Yeah, you're probably right.

1362
01:09:34,759 --> 01:09:36,661
That's too bad. Can I just
be honest with you?

1363
01:09:36,694 --> 01:09:38,461
- Sure.
- You're not as good-looking

1364
01:09:38,495 --> 01:09:39,596
as you was before.

1365
01:09:40,031 --> 01:09:42,399
- I know.
- Every time I see you,

1366
01:09:42,432 --> 01:09:44,534
- you're a little fatter.
- That's not my fault.

1367
01:09:44,568 --> 01:09:46,403
I eat when I get bored
or hungry.

1368
01:09:46,436 --> 01:09:48,605
- Your hair's thinning out.
- Nothing I can do about that.

1369
01:09:48,638 --> 01:09:50,041
I take the pills. Nothing works.

1370
01:09:50,074 --> 01:09:51,608
You gotta remember,

1371
01:09:51,641 --> 01:09:53,577
do the things you fear the most,

1372
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:56,479
the death of fear is certain.

1373
01:09:57,315 --> 01:10:00,885
- Are you quoting Laird again?
- Hey, F-U! That's Mark Twain.

1374
01:10:01,384 --> 01:10:04,487
Maybe Confucius.
Or maybe even me.

1375
01:10:07,058 --> 01:10:08,558
Let me grab my camera.

1376
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,695
Yeah. That's my boy.

1377
01:10:10,728 --> 01:10:13,430
Dougie! You're rolling!
Roll, Dougie!

1378
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:17,034
Roll 'em! Yeah! Yeah!

1379
01:10:17,068 --> 01:10:19,436
[shouting] Woo!

1380
01:10:19,469 --> 01:10:22,106
Yeah, come on,
you frickin' [unclear]. Woo!

1381
01:10:28,445 --> 01:10:30,181
Hey!

1382
01:10:30,214 --> 01:10:33,184
- Help!
- [shouting]

1383
01:10:33,217 --> 01:10:35,820
- Yeah!
- Help!

1384
01:10:35,853 --> 01:10:37,788
Come on. Come on.

1385
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:43,194
- What's your name, boy?
- [boy] Ethan.

1386
01:10:43,227 --> 01:10:45,696
- Your last name.
- Leftin.

1387
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:48,065
- Are you getting this, Dougie?
- Yeah, copy that. 10-4.

1388
01:10:48,099 --> 01:10:50,167
Camera's rolling.
Sound is speeding.

1389
01:10:50,201 --> 01:10:52,535
- Hey. Calm down, Dougie.
- I'm calm. We are live!

1390
01:10:52,569 --> 01:10:55,039
Hey, now that we rescued
your skinny ass

1391
01:10:55,072 --> 01:10:56,941
out of the water,
you're gonna tell us

1392
01:10:56,974 --> 01:10:59,509
who would pay you
for graffiti that wall.

1393
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:02,179
- You're on national TV!
- International!

1394
01:11:02,213 --> 01:11:04,916
- It was the guy from the county.
- Louder!

1395
01:11:04,949 --> 01:11:08,652
- Describe the lowlife.
- He gave me $75 each time.

1396
01:11:08,686 --> 01:11:11,454
- And I only did it...
- Okay, spare us the reasons why,

1397
01:11:11,488 --> 01:11:14,659
you skinny-ass punk.
Describe the guy that paid you.

1398
01:11:14,692 --> 01:11:16,861
- Calm down, Dougie.
- I'm calm!

1399
01:11:16,894 --> 01:11:18,461
I think his name
was Peter Poulet.

1400
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:21,832
You know, the guy who wears
his pants a little too high.

1401
01:11:21,866 --> 01:11:24,135
Yeah, and the male
camel toe situation.

1402
01:11:24,168 --> 01:11:26,503
- I noticed that too.
- Ugh, disgusting.

1403
01:11:26,536 --> 01:11:29,472
Yeah. But who paid him?
Who are you working for?

1404
01:11:29,506 --> 01:11:32,475
- Yeah, who's paying him?
- I don't know.

1405
01:11:32,509 --> 01:11:34,879
Hey, boy. You like who
shut down this hotel?

1406
01:11:34,912 --> 01:11:36,948
You like this place
called Waikiki?

1407
01:11:36,981 --> 01:11:40,251
That means no more kiting
for you and the [unclear] crew!

1408
01:11:40,284 --> 01:11:41,919
So what you gonna do?

1409
01:11:41,953 --> 01:11:43,620
I don't know. I'm sorry.

1410
01:11:43,653 --> 01:11:46,791
I only did it
so I could buy a new kite.

1411
01:11:46,824 --> 01:11:49,193
I'm not done with you yet.
You're coming with us.

1412
01:11:49,994 --> 01:11:51,028
[elevator dings]

1413
01:11:51,594 --> 01:11:53,530
The office should be
right down there.

1414
01:11:54,098 --> 01:11:55,933
Hey, after we do this,
I gotta get back,

1415
01:11:55,967 --> 01:11:57,234
teach my yoga class.

1416
01:11:57,268 --> 01:11:59,203
- You do yoga?
- Yeah. Shut up.

1417
01:11:59,236 --> 01:12:01,906
Don't judge eagles based on
opinions of turkeys.

1418
01:12:01,939 --> 01:12:04,942
Wo-ho, snap. I was rolling live
on that one, brotha.

1419
01:12:04,976 --> 01:12:07,144
Wait, how is that thing
even live?

1420
01:12:07,178 --> 01:12:10,047
- How 'bout I kick your ass live?
- Dougie! Come on, Dougie.

1421
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:30,067
All right. On the count
of three, go ahead.

1422
01:12:30,101 --> 01:12:32,635
Three, two...

1423
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:35,072
Wait, wait, wait.
On one, or go after?

1424
01:12:35,773 --> 01:12:37,775
- Three.
- Three, two, and then one?

1425
01:12:37,808 --> 01:12:39,176
- Yes.
- Or go...

1426
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:41,746
- Three, two, one, then go.
- Okay. On one.

1427
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:43,280
- Yes.
- Or one, and then go?

1428
01:12:43,314 --> 01:12:44,949
One and then go, okay.

1429
01:12:48,052 --> 01:12:50,021
[yells]

1430
01:12:52,622 --> 01:12:54,692
[screams]

1431
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:59,063
All right, class. It's time
for the crouching vana.

1432
01:12:59,096 --> 01:13:01,766
Some of you guys who
wasn't here, or missed it,

1433
01:13:01,799 --> 01:13:04,601
basically, what you're gonna do
is, you're gonna put yourself

1434
01:13:04,634 --> 01:13:06,303
into a tight ball.

1435
01:13:06,337 --> 01:13:08,638
Okay? You're gonna hold
your breath.

1436
01:13:08,672 --> 01:13:11,308
Okay. Everybody, come on.
Follow me. Get down.

1437
01:13:11,342 --> 01:13:13,911
Into a ball. Like an urchin.
There you go.

1438
01:13:13,944 --> 01:13:16,646
That's the crouching vana.
Now, hold your breath.

1439
01:13:18,849 --> 01:13:21,352
All right?
All this breathing thing

1440
01:13:21,385 --> 01:13:25,656
that Shiv is talking about,
how breath is the breastmilk,

1441
01:13:25,689 --> 01:13:28,225
that's disgusting!
It's not even important!

1442
01:13:28,259 --> 01:13:30,294
What's important?
Holding your breath.

1443
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:32,763
What if we get wiped
by a big-ass wave,

1444
01:13:32,797 --> 01:13:35,199
or someone drops
a nasty pooey on you? Huh?

1445
01:13:35,232 --> 01:13:36,767
Hold your breath.

1446
01:13:37,701 --> 01:13:39,236
Speaking of farting,

1447
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:41,705
anybody have to share
something with the class?

1448
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:44,607
Okay, because, you know,
that kind of offering

1449
01:13:44,641 --> 01:13:47,344
- is acceptable.
- [moaning]

1450
01:13:47,378 --> 01:13:49,313
It actually sounds like
someone needs help.

1451
01:13:49,346 --> 01:13:51,315
Okay. Hold on.

1452
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:53,784
Stay there in urchin!

1453
01:13:53,818 --> 01:13:56,586
And remember, don't breathe!

1454
01:13:58,889 --> 01:14:01,358
And don't forget, tip, tip.

1455
01:14:09,233 --> 01:14:11,368
- [muffled yell]
- I knew you were kinky.

1456
01:14:11,402 --> 01:14:14,071
[muffled sound]

1457
01:14:14,105 --> 01:14:17,875
Hey, but if it feels good
for you, then it's okay with me.

1458
01:14:17,908 --> 01:14:20,711
If you okay with it,
not passing any judgment.

1459
01:14:20,744 --> 01:14:24,014
[muffled talk]

1460
01:14:26,317 --> 01:14:28,052
Always gotta be
the good Samaritan.

1461
01:14:45,202 --> 01:14:47,404
- [muffled yell]
- What?

1462
01:14:47,438 --> 01:14:50,074
[muffled talk]

1463
01:14:50,107 --> 01:14:52,176
I can't understand
what you're saying.

1464
01:14:52,209 --> 01:14:54,778
What? You want me
to set you free?

1465
01:14:54,812 --> 01:14:56,914
- [muffled shout]
- If I do that,

1466
01:14:56,947 --> 01:14:58,983
you better play fair.
For example,

1467
01:14:59,016 --> 01:15:00,784
who has priority over the beach?

1468
01:15:00,818 --> 01:15:03,187
Anytime, anywhere, forever?

1469
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,989
- You.
- Okay.

1470
01:15:05,956 --> 01:15:07,925
What took you so long?

1471
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:09,693
What are you talking about?

1472
01:15:09,727 --> 01:15:12,763
I've been here for 17 days
and 17 nights.

1473
01:15:12,796 --> 01:15:15,332
More like five hours,
but nobody care.

1474
01:15:15,866 --> 01:15:20,171
I've got to get out of here.
Untie my hands and feet.

1475
01:15:21,105 --> 01:15:23,974
I do that, you're gonna owe me.

1476
01:15:30,514 --> 01:15:33,217
Oh! You want
a Green Goddess too?

1477
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,486
Added a splash of vodka.

1478
01:15:35,519 --> 01:15:38,255
Nah, I'm good. That stuff make
me crap my board shorts.

1479
01:15:38,289 --> 01:15:40,858
Who said you could take
his gag off?

1480
01:15:40,891 --> 01:15:43,294
What you doing gagging him?
I mean, like, I understand,

1481
01:15:43,327 --> 01:15:46,197
because there are many times
that I wanted to gag him.

1482
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:48,999
And who gave you permission
to ask for help?

1483
01:15:49,033 --> 01:15:50,768
But I was saying the safe word.

1484
01:15:51,835 --> 01:15:53,771
Well, I couldn't understand you.

1485
01:15:53,804 --> 01:15:55,839
You know what?
Hey, get out of here.

1486
01:15:55,873 --> 01:15:57,408
I'll handle this.
Get out of here.

1487
01:15:57,441 --> 01:16:00,177
- [gasping]
- But we had something special.

1488
01:16:00,211 --> 01:16:03,147
- But it hurts too much.
- Well, love hurts sometimes.

1489
01:16:04,348 --> 01:16:06,383
Hey. Hold on. Hold on.

1490
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:08,986
<i>Get ready, Hawaii,
because the real story</i>

1491
01:16:09,019 --> 01:16:12,389
<i>is going live this afternoon.
Press conference and everything</i>

1492
01:16:12,423 --> 01:16:15,125
<i>Scandal of the century
right here!</i>

1493
01:16:15,159 --> 01:16:18,362
<i>No, Mahina, stay right there.
People want to know the truth.</i>

1494
01:16:18,395 --> 01:16:20,431
<i>We're gonna go
to commercial break.</i>

1495
01:16:20,464 --> 01:16:22,866
<i>Wait, stop. Get off me.
'Cause we are not gonna go</i>

1496
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:25,236
<i>to commercial because
people want to know the truth.</i>

1497
01:16:25,269 --> 01:16:27,204
<i>I have secret footage
to show everybody.</i>

1498
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:30,107
<i>No, because I am sick of being
just a weatherman, okay?</i>

1499
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:32,943
<i>I have more potential than that
Everyone has more potential,</i>

1500
01:16:32,977 --> 01:16:34,478
<i>even Miss Mahina
has more potential.</i>

1501
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:40,317
[singing in Hawaiian]

1502
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:59,136
[speaking in Hawaiian]

1503
01:16:59,169 --> 01:17:00,771
[in English] And here we go.

1504
01:17:01,305 --> 01:17:03,240
Thank you, boss.

1505
01:17:03,274 --> 01:17:06,343
So what we have uncovered here

1506
01:17:06,377 --> 01:17:09,413
is that this guy right here

1507
01:17:09,446 --> 01:17:13,250
is a pawn.
And the kid he paid money to

1508
01:17:13,284 --> 01:17:17,354
even more of a pawn, and getting
money for somebody else, right?

1509
01:17:18,489 --> 01:17:20,557
So why don't you tell everybody,

1510
01:17:20,591 --> 01:17:22,259
why don't you tell
the whole world,

1511
01:17:22,293 --> 01:17:24,128
right now, who you work for.

1512
01:17:26,163 --> 01:17:29,466
I was taking bribes from an
executive at Conquistador.

1513
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,567
What else?

1514
01:17:31,568 --> 01:17:34,104
Their goal was to run this place
into the ground.

1515
01:17:34,138 --> 01:17:37,241
Buy the land cheap
and build a luxury resort.

1516
01:17:37,274 --> 01:17:39,576
[Doug] Ba-bam! I got that.
I was rolling,

1517
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:42,313
- and I got that on tape.
- Hey! Dougie, calm down!

1518
01:17:42,346 --> 01:17:44,615
- Calm down.
- You're going down.

1519
01:17:44,648 --> 01:17:47,584
So why don't you tell everybody
where this guy's at right now.

1520
01:17:47,618 --> 01:17:49,887
I think he's at
that surf competition.

1521
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,288
What?

1522
01:17:51,822 --> 01:17:55,426
Yeah. The Conquistador Club
is the main sponsor

1523
01:17:55,459 --> 01:17:57,294
trying to get in good
with the locals.

1524
01:17:58,896 --> 01:18:00,197
For real?

1525
01:18:00,564 --> 01:18:02,900
Surf competition today?

1526
01:18:04,301 --> 01:18:07,438
Yeah. Swell filled in.
I got called this morning.

1527
01:18:07,471 --> 01:18:09,440
So what are we waiting for?
Let's go!

1528
01:18:11,075 --> 01:18:15,379
Hey. Quitting, easy.
Daring to triumph, hard.

1529
01:18:15,412 --> 01:18:17,381
- Is that Yoda?
- No, it's actually

1530
01:18:17,414 --> 01:18:19,116
a Laird Hamilton quote.

1531
01:18:19,149 --> 01:18:21,985
How many of you guys
want to see this badass

1532
01:18:22,019 --> 01:18:24,355
surf in a competition today?

1533
01:18:24,388 --> 01:18:25,622
[everyone cheers]

1534
01:18:27,091 --> 01:18:29,460
- Got to listen to the people.
- Okay.

1535
01:18:29,493 --> 01:18:31,562
But only if you do this.

1536
01:18:31,595 --> 01:18:34,898
- What's this?
- Online math class.

1537
01:18:34,932 --> 01:18:37,267
I already signed you up.
And I can coach you.

1538
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:40,137
Okay. But surf first.

1539
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,939
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1540
01:18:42,873 --> 01:18:45,275
[host] Aloha! Coming at you
with today's daily

1541
01:18:45,309 --> 01:18:48,345
rubber neck surf check.
And surf today is unreal!

1542
01:18:48,379 --> 01:18:50,381
It's pumping in the three
to five-foot range.

1543
01:18:50,414 --> 01:18:52,282
Perfect time for the finals.

1544
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:55,085
And I think I'm going to enter
the longboard event myself.

1545
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:57,454
'Cause the water
is so perfect today.

1546
01:18:57,488 --> 01:19:00,424
And that wraps it up
for our rubber neck surf check.

1547
01:19:00,457 --> 01:19:04,128
[announcer] Pristine conditions
for the 22nd annual

1548
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:06,263
International Competition.

1549
01:19:10,134 --> 01:19:14,338
Okay. Patience. Patience.

1550
01:19:14,371 --> 01:19:16,674
Come on. Come on. There you go.

1551
01:19:17,174 --> 01:19:20,010
There you go! Perfect!

1552
01:19:21,145 --> 01:19:24,481
Okay. All right. Bottom turn.

1553
01:19:24,515 --> 01:19:28,585
Smack the lip.
Smack the lip hard!

1554
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:31,689
Ba-boom! Oh. Tuck in.

1555
01:19:31,723 --> 01:19:35,259
Tuck in. Aha! There you go!

1556
01:19:35,292 --> 01:19:37,428
[cheers]

1557
01:19:37,461 --> 01:19:39,229
- Yay!
- Yes!

1558
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,732
You saw that? Ten!

1559
01:19:40,765 --> 01:19:44,468
I'll take a perfect ten
from you, and you,

1560
01:19:44,501 --> 01:19:47,204
and you! Yes!

1561
01:19:47,237 --> 01:19:48,972
- Yes! Yes!
- [reporter] I tell you,

1562
01:19:49,006 --> 01:19:51,308
she might be a newcomer,
but she surfs like a pro.

1563
01:19:51,341 --> 01:19:55,145
All that confidence and poise.
And you know what I heard?

1564
01:19:55,179 --> 01:19:58,215
Her coach is Tai Alonzo.

1565
01:19:58,248 --> 01:19:59,717
- You remember that name?
- What?

1566
01:19:59,751 --> 01:20:01,652
That's one of the great surfers
of Hawaii.

1567
01:20:01,686 --> 01:20:04,555
I know, I know.
What ever happened to him?

1568
01:20:04,588 --> 01:20:06,256
- I thought he was dead.
- Gonzo.

1569
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:08,392
[woman] Gonzo Alonzo.

1570
01:20:08,425 --> 01:20:10,394
Hey, are you signing up
for open longboard?

1571
01:20:10,427 --> 01:20:13,163
- I don't compete anymore.
- Why?

1572
01:20:13,197 --> 01:20:14,732
I got kicked off the tour.

1573
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:17,034
But I heard it was only
a ten-year suspension.

1574
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:19,069
- Yeah?
- And it's been almost 20.

1575
01:20:19,102 --> 01:20:21,004
Yeah, maybe.

1576
01:20:21,038 --> 01:20:23,207
Look at you trying to get all
mathematical on me.

1577
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,109
- ...new woman, Kaila Vincent.
- Oh!

1578
01:20:26,143 --> 01:20:29,513
- [man] Kaila Vincent.
- What I told you, huh?

1579
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,649
- Good job!
- Yeah.

1580
01:20:32,684 --> 01:20:35,285
But now, it's your turn.
Masters longboard.

1581
01:20:35,319 --> 01:20:37,387
I mean, since you say
you're a master and all.

1582
01:20:37,421 --> 01:20:39,556
- Yeah, I'm good.
- That's what you always say.

1583
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:42,593
But I think we'd all like
to actually see it.

1584
01:20:42,626 --> 01:20:44,428
Yeah, who wants to see him try?

1585
01:20:44,461 --> 01:20:46,230
- [cheers]
- Don't forget.

1586
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:49,099
Stay right where you are,
because coming up next is

1587
01:20:49,132 --> 01:20:52,336
the men's longboard
surfing championship.

1588
01:20:52,369 --> 01:20:54,238
- [woman] Woo-hoo.
- And I have to say,

1589
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:55,673
back in the day, you know...

1590
01:20:55,707 --> 01:20:57,641
[woman] I heard about
your longboard.

1591
01:20:57,675 --> 01:20:59,176
[man] Oh! We got Alonzo

1592
01:20:59,209 --> 01:21:01,478
dropping into a beautiful wave.

1593
01:21:01,512 --> 01:21:04,081
[woman] Whoa. He's way more
flexible than you'd think.

1594
01:21:04,114 --> 01:21:05,616
[man] Look at that <i>opu</i>
on that board.

1595
01:21:05,649 --> 01:21:07,685
Yeah!

1596
01:21:11,088 --> 01:21:12,724
He's got another one, folks.

1597
01:21:12,757 --> 01:21:15,760
Carving it like
a Thanksgiving Day turkey.

1598
01:21:15,793 --> 01:21:18,128
- Oh, yeah.
- [cheers]

1599
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,435
Woo!

1600
01:21:25,469 --> 01:21:27,271
[man] Yep. There it is.

1601
01:21:27,304 --> 01:21:29,741
His signature dead cockroach.

1602
01:21:29,774 --> 01:21:32,576
He's gonna take that one
all the way to the bank.

1603
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:36,446
- Congratulations.
- Yeah!

1604
01:21:37,548 --> 01:21:39,583
- [applause]
- Yeah!

1605
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,289
And of course, this comes
with a $3,000 check

1606
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:46,691
from Conquistador.

1607
01:21:46,724 --> 01:21:48,225
[cheers]

1608
01:21:50,527 --> 01:21:52,596
- Alonzo!
- Dougie. You rolling?

1609
01:21:52,629 --> 01:21:54,766
- We are live!
- Roll. Roll.

1610
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,635
And congratulations to you,
Mr. Alonzo.

1611
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:00,604
[cheers]

1612
01:22:00,637 --> 01:22:02,339
You don't remember me, huh?

1613
01:22:02,372 --> 01:22:03,775
Can't say that I do.

1614
01:22:03,808 --> 01:22:05,576
I always knew
you was a criminal.

1615
01:22:05,609 --> 01:22:06,778
Okay. What do you want?

1616
01:22:06,811 --> 01:22:08,445
Hey, guys, see this executive

1617
01:22:08,478 --> 01:22:10,213
from Conquistador Club?

1618
01:22:10,247 --> 01:22:12,516
He's bribing
the county inspector.

1619
01:22:12,549 --> 01:22:16,653
I said he's bribing
the county inspector.

1620
01:22:16,688 --> 01:22:19,389
Get this guy off the stage.
Get this guy off the stage.

1621
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:23,327
Get him. Get him!

1622
01:22:24,628 --> 01:22:26,330
Come on! Dougie! Let's go!

1623
01:22:26,363 --> 01:22:28,332
Already got 'em.

1624
01:22:28,365 --> 01:22:30,367
- [Tai] Come on!
- [Dougie] I'm rolling.

1625
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,336
- Stop him!
- [Tai] Come on!

1626
01:22:33,604 --> 01:22:35,472
[crowd exclaims]

1627
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:45,616
Hey-hey, not today, honey.

1628
01:22:46,316 --> 01:22:48,518
Big brah.

1629
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,489
[siren blares]

1630
01:22:52,522 --> 01:22:55,592
- Doug! You got the footage?
- You know I did, brah!

1631
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:58,863
Five-o, what's going on
over here?

1632
01:22:58,896 --> 01:23:00,865
Officer, I got everything
on my camera.

1633
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:02,800
I got confessions,
incriminating evidence,

1634
01:23:02,834 --> 01:23:04,635
everything. You need it,
I got it right here.

1635
01:23:04,669 --> 01:23:06,370
Calm down, Dougie. Calm down.

1636
01:23:06,403 --> 01:23:09,306
Hey, where you at?

1637
01:23:10,775 --> 01:23:13,644
Oh! Man.

1638
01:23:14,112 --> 01:23:15,813
Yeah, no, I can respect that.

1639
01:23:15,847 --> 01:23:17,547
I've done that
many times myself.

1640
01:23:17,581 --> 01:23:20,183
Officer, see the guy swimming
towards Tahiti?

1641
01:23:20,217 --> 01:23:21,819
- Yeah.
- He bribed the county inspector.

1642
01:23:21,853 --> 01:23:23,553
Tried to shut down the hotel.

1643
01:23:23,587 --> 01:23:26,858
- Oh, roger that.
- According to U.S. Code 20-218,

1644
01:23:26,891 --> 01:23:30,193
that's a felony.
Three years prison time.

1645
01:23:30,227 --> 01:23:31,729
Oh, you really know
your stuff, huh?

1646
01:23:31,763 --> 01:23:33,463
I took one year
of criminal justice.

1647
01:23:33,497 --> 01:23:35,298
- I'll let you take that.
- I'll do that.

1648
01:23:35,332 --> 01:23:36,834
I have business to take care of.

1649
01:23:36,868 --> 01:23:40,637
I gotta take my $500 check
and go pick up my van.

1650
01:23:41,204 --> 01:23:42,840
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

1651
01:23:42,874 --> 01:23:44,842
Hey, Coach. This is for you.

1652
01:23:44,876 --> 01:23:46,711
So you can see your daughter.

1653
01:23:47,111 --> 01:23:49,579
- For real?
- Yeah.

1654
01:23:51,949 --> 01:23:53,818
You can pay me back
when we get paid.

1655
01:23:53,851 --> 01:23:54,886
For real?

1656
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:58,355
It should be about
next week, bully boy.

1657
01:23:58,388 --> 01:24:00,424
[all laugh]

1658
01:24:01,525 --> 01:24:03,393
- [tools whir]
- [pig oinks]

1659
01:24:05,697 --> 01:24:06,831
How's it, brah?

1660
01:24:08,265 --> 01:24:10,902
- Moment of truth, huh?
- Yeah, cashed my check.

1661
01:24:10,935 --> 01:24:13,805
I got your $500,
and the rest goes to my ex.

1662
01:24:13,838 --> 01:24:15,740
Look, man, I saw you
on the news.

1663
01:24:15,773 --> 01:24:17,675
- For real?
- Yeah, I thought that was

1664
01:24:17,709 --> 01:24:20,277
a cool thing that you did, man,
stopping the developers

1665
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:22,947
- on the hotel and the beach.
- Yeah, but it wasn't only me.

1666
01:24:23,413 --> 01:24:25,783
Look, man, I hooked you up
on the van, man.

1667
01:24:25,817 --> 01:24:27,985
I put a new battery in it, man.
Tuned it up, man.

1668
01:24:28,019 --> 01:24:29,921
And put some new tires
on it for you, man.

1669
01:24:29,954 --> 01:24:31,856
- Solid, man. Thank you!
- Yeah, man.

1670
01:24:31,889 --> 01:24:33,658
Runs good enough
to get you home, man.

1671
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:36,560
The bug over there,
that is home.

1672
01:24:36,593 --> 01:24:38,763
And I found a new parking space.

1673
01:24:38,796 --> 01:24:40,330
- Yeah? Where's that?
- At work.

1674
01:24:40,363 --> 01:24:42,499
My boss is solid.
He's cool with that.

1675
01:24:42,532 --> 01:24:44,802
You'll never be late
for work, man.

1676
01:24:45,435 --> 01:24:47,404
I never thought about it
that way.

1677
01:24:47,437 --> 01:24:48,873
Right? Yeah, man!

1678
01:24:48,906 --> 01:24:50,875
- Here you go, brah.
- All right, brotha.

1679
01:24:52,309 --> 01:24:53,811
[oinks]

1680
01:25:11,863 --> 01:25:13,765
[clears throat] [laughs]

1681
01:25:13,798 --> 01:25:16,500
Not bad! Four out of five stars.

1682
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:18,568
- Woo!
- From the Super Reviewer.

1683
01:25:18,602 --> 01:25:20,705
Super Reviewer. You know this
whole idea of <i>Time</i>

1684
01:25:20,738 --> 01:25:22,707
wanting to change the name
of this hotel?

1685
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:26,443
Number one Aloha Surf Hotel
Retreat and Spa and Yogurt Shop.

1686
01:25:26,476 --> 01:25:29,346
Whatever he did
is actually working.

1687
01:25:29,379 --> 01:25:31,381
You know, it is crazy,
but we're showing up

1688
01:25:31,414 --> 01:25:33,617
at all the top of the searches.
At the top of the searches!

1689
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:35,352
- How does he even know that?
- He went to school.

1690
01:25:35,385 --> 01:25:37,354
Went to college.
And whatever it is,

1691
01:25:37,387 --> 01:25:39,456
he's pulling us out
of this nosedive.

1692
01:25:39,489 --> 01:25:40,590
Woo-hoo!

1693
01:25:41,591 --> 01:25:43,426
- Checking out?
- Yes.

1694
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:45,529
But we also look for tennis pro.

1695
01:25:45,562 --> 01:25:47,965
Oh, sorry,
he's gone for the day.

1696
01:25:47,999 --> 01:25:50,333
- Oh.
- This is for pro.

1697
01:25:50,835 --> 01:25:54,371
[counting in Chinese]

1698
01:25:56,774 --> 01:26:00,443
Eight hundred eighty-eight
dollar. Very lucky number.

1699
01:26:00,477 --> 01:26:02,579
- Lucky number.
- What?

1700
01:26:02,612 --> 01:26:05,783
Yeah, the pro,
he throw my phone in ocean.

1701
01:26:05,817 --> 01:26:07,317
It was best gift for us.

1702
01:26:08,052 --> 01:26:09,987
We know each other now.

1703
01:26:10,021 --> 01:26:11,588
Really know.

1704
01:26:11,621 --> 01:26:13,791
Only pictures in our head.

1705
01:26:14,192 --> 01:26:15,793
Romantic-y pictures.

1706
01:26:16,227 --> 01:26:18,461
We're really happy to hear that.

1707
01:26:18,495 --> 01:26:22,432
And we will tell all China
about this place.

1708
01:26:22,465 --> 01:26:24,367
And the funny little tennis man.

1709
01:26:24,401 --> 01:26:27,337
He teach us the way
to true love.

1710
01:26:27,972 --> 01:26:29,406
No selfies.

1711
01:26:29,974 --> 01:26:32,009
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1712
01:26:34,111 --> 01:26:37,414
- <i>Aloha.</i>
- <i>Mahalo.</i>

1713
01:26:37,447 --> 01:26:38,916
You better give that to Tai.

1714
01:26:43,154 --> 01:26:44,822
You okay, brah?

1715
01:26:45,488 --> 01:26:49,093
You know, being like that
for 17 days and nights...

1716
01:26:49,126 --> 01:26:50,862
It was like six hours.

1717
01:26:50,895 --> 01:26:54,131
Having my voice robbed of me
for the first time...

1718
01:26:54,999 --> 01:26:56,868
gave me some time to think.

1719
01:26:56,901 --> 01:26:59,170
- That's a good thing, right?
- I don't know.

1720
01:26:59,203 --> 01:27:02,740
I've been thinking I should
probably go back to New Jersey.

1721
01:27:03,841 --> 01:27:05,142
Maybe not a bad idea.

1722
01:27:06,744 --> 01:27:08,679
You might ask yourself,

1723
01:27:08,713 --> 01:27:13,483
but what about the thousands
of students that need me here?

1724
01:27:13,516 --> 01:27:16,754
Who love me and, like, adore me.

1725
01:27:16,787 --> 01:27:18,789
Might ask, but didn't.

1726
01:27:19,257 --> 01:27:23,460
You know, I realized that
they don't really love me.

1727
01:27:24,262 --> 01:27:27,098
They just love the myth
of the person

1728
01:27:27,131 --> 01:27:29,532
I'm telling them
that they can be.

1729
01:27:29,934 --> 01:27:31,068
It's narcissism.

1730
01:27:31,102 --> 01:27:33,004
Oh, you're getting deep, huh?

1731
01:27:33,037 --> 01:27:35,405
It's Maya. It's an illusion.

1732
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:36,974
Because...

1733
01:27:38,209 --> 01:27:40,945
because I've just been really
regurgitating meanless words

1734
01:27:40,978 --> 01:27:45,016
that I learned in a creepy
Ashram in Karnataka.

1735
01:27:45,049 --> 01:27:48,585
You're right.
We're in Hawaii <i>nei.</i>

1736
01:27:48,618 --> 01:27:51,789
We should be out there
riding the waves.

1737
01:27:51,822 --> 01:27:54,491
If you like,
I can show you tomorrow.

1738
01:27:55,226 --> 01:27:58,561
- Tomorrow I fly.
- What you gonna do?

1739
01:27:58,595 --> 01:28:01,165
I've been taking online
real estate courses.

1740
01:28:03,668 --> 01:28:06,469
Oh. You got my blessings.

1741
01:28:07,238 --> 01:28:08,940
Hey, man, don't mock me, okay?

1742
01:28:12,609 --> 01:28:16,147
[laughs]
Hey, what's your real name?

1743
01:28:16,981 --> 01:28:20,583
- Can you tell me your name?
- No, I can't do that, man. No.

1744
01:28:20,985 --> 01:28:22,652
- How about Joe?
- No.

1745
01:28:22,687 --> 01:28:24,822
How about Bill? Milton?

1746
01:28:24,855 --> 01:28:26,090
- No.
- Tommy?

1747
01:28:26,123 --> 01:28:27,490
- No.
- Mitchell?

1748
01:28:27,524 --> 01:28:28,826
- No.
- Logan?

1749
01:28:28,859 --> 01:28:29,961
Not even close.

1750
01:28:29,994 --> 01:28:31,996
Hey, you know what? Um...

1751
01:28:33,130 --> 01:28:35,066
I got something for you, okay?

1752
01:28:35,666 --> 01:28:36,901
[groans]

1753
01:28:36,934 --> 01:28:38,535
Here, this is yours now.

1754
01:28:38,936 --> 01:28:41,072
Oh, I got something
for you too, brah.

1755
01:28:41,105 --> 01:28:42,907
Here. Yours.

1756
01:28:43,374 --> 01:28:44,875
Keep it fresh, bro.

1757
01:28:46,911 --> 01:28:48,079
Hey, thanks, brah.

1758
01:28:48,913 --> 01:28:50,613
Hey, shaka, okay?

1759
01:28:50,647 --> 01:28:52,116
[rattles]

1760
01:28:58,723 --> 01:28:59,957
[Alana] Dad!

1761
01:29:01,225 --> 01:29:03,060
- Dad?
- Alana!

1762
01:29:03,094 --> 01:29:06,063
[laughs] What you doin' here?
Is this your weekend?

1763
01:29:06,097 --> 01:29:08,631
No, but you gotta get dressed
and cleaned up.

1764
01:29:11,068 --> 01:29:13,804
Surprise. I made this for you.

1765
01:29:15,306 --> 01:29:16,539
Happy early birthday.

1766
01:29:16,974 --> 01:29:18,309
Whoa.

1767
01:29:18,342 --> 01:29:21,712
Dad, it's,
it's really beautiful.

1768
01:29:21,746 --> 01:29:23,714
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1769
01:29:25,883 --> 01:29:28,152
Okay, but we gotta go,
and you need to get dressed.

1770
01:29:28,185 --> 01:29:30,721
- I am dressed.
- At least change your shirt.

1771
01:29:30,755 --> 01:29:32,857
- Why?
- You passed!

1772
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:35,059
- I passed?
- Yes. Let's go.

1773
01:29:35,092 --> 01:29:37,594
Completing just that one
math credit

1774
01:29:37,627 --> 01:29:41,265
actually vaulted him
into our college history book.

1775
01:29:41,298 --> 01:29:42,833
[cheers, applause]

1776
01:29:42,867 --> 01:29:44,802
[Alana] Yeah, Dad! Woo!

1777
01:29:46,771 --> 01:29:48,973
Because that one final
math credit

1778
01:29:49,407 --> 01:29:51,976
means he's actually completed
degrees in the following...

1779
01:29:52,009 --> 01:29:53,844
And I'll list them
alphabetically.

1780
01:29:53,878 --> 01:29:56,579

and turtle husbandry.

1788
01:30:18,936 --> 01:30:20,971
[cheers, applause]

1789
01:30:21,405 --> 01:30:23,741
So why don't you come on up
and get your degree,

1790
01:30:23,774 --> 01:30:26,643
Mr. Tai Gonzo Alonzo!

1791
01:30:26,677 --> 01:30:28,712
[cheers, applause]

1792
01:30:28,746 --> 01:30:30,613
[Tai] Yeah!

1793
01:30:30,647 --> 01:30:34,584
What a unbelievable time.
I feel official.

1794
01:30:35,052 --> 01:30:37,822
Hold on, sistah.
You forgot one thing.

1795
01:30:37,855 --> 01:30:40,057
Philosophy of surf!

1796
01:30:40,091 --> 01:30:42,693
[cheers]

1797
01:30:44,261 --> 01:30:47,098
My apologies.
It is also, indeed, on the list.

1798
01:30:48,332 --> 01:30:50,668
[cheers, applause]

1799
01:30:54,839 --> 01:30:56,774
- Proud of you.
- Thank you.

1800
01:30:57,141 --> 01:30:58,608
All right! Yeah!

1801
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:01,912
So I say this
to all the kids out there:

1802
01:31:02,947 --> 01:31:04,715
It pays to stay in school!

1803
01:31:04,748 --> 01:31:07,151
[cheers]

1804
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:43,721
Ya-hoo! How's the young bums?

1805
01:31:44,188 --> 01:31:45,389
Woo!

1806
01:31:45,422 --> 01:31:47,158
You know, Tai,

1807
01:31:47,191 --> 01:31:49,193
we should try kiting
one of these days.

1808
01:31:49,226 --> 01:31:52,296
Brah, there's nothing more sad
than a surfer that used to surf.

1809
01:31:52,329 --> 01:31:54,031
Who said that one, Dad?

1810
01:31:54,798 --> 01:31:56,967
I don't know.
But I think I will claim 'em.

1811
01:31:57,001 --> 01:31:58,969
[laughs]

1812
01:31:59,003 --> 01:32:00,905
- Hey!
- Get out of here.

No doubt. Look, I hate it, okay?

1819
01:32:23,761 --> 01:32:25,729
What's the point?
They just check their phones.

1820
01:32:25,763 --> 01:32:28,265
What? Yep. Huh? Tai!

1821
01:32:28,299 --> 01:32:30,768
- [Tai] You suck as a weatherman.
- Hold on a second.

1822
01:32:30,801 --> 01:32:32,369
I don't suck that bad.

1823
01:32:32,403 --> 01:32:34,104
[laughs]

1824
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:36,473
I forgot my line.

1825
01:32:36,507 --> 01:32:39,076
- Keep doing it.
- Oh.

1826
01:32:39,109 --> 01:32:41,212
So what are you gonna do
about it, Dad?

1827
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,216
- Watch.
- [laughs]

1828
01:32:45,249 --> 01:32:47,284
[director] Okay. Cut, good.

1829
01:32:48,219 --> 01:32:49,753
Psst. Brah.

1830
01:32:49,787 --> 01:32:51,188
- [laughs]
- [siren]

1831
01:32:51,222 --> 01:32:53,190
[director]
Cut! Can you hear that?

1832
01:32:53,224 --> 01:32:54,758
Huh?

1833
01:32:54,792 --> 01:32:56,227
You do it already?

1834
01:32:56,594 --> 01:32:59,196
Elvis Presley put his <i>okole</i>
right here, brah.

1835
01:32:59,230 --> 01:33:00,864
And went. [blows raspberry]

1836
01:33:00,898 --> 01:33:02,866
Portuguese bean soup
all over the place.

1837
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:06,003
- [laughs]
- What's wrong with you? Hey!

1838
01:33:06,036 --> 01:33:09,807
Indeed. Yoga is for the meek
and the cripple.

1839
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:14,178
Anyways... listen!

1840
01:33:21,418 --> 01:33:23,153
[laughs]

1841

I'm holding a fart so bad,
you guys don't even know.

1843
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:39,303
I'm so used to it,
I wouldn't even know.

1844
01:33:39,336 --> 01:33:44,074
Do the thing you feel the most,
and then you suddenly die.

1845
01:33:45,442 --> 01:33:47,911
[both laugh]

1846
01:33:49,947 --> 01:33:52,516
- That's what I said.
- No, you said go on one.

1847
01:33:52,983 --> 01:33:55,452
- Three.
- No smiling, Cyrus.

1848
01:33:56,253 --> 01:33:57,988
[all laugh]

1849
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:08,232
- Oh.
- [director] cut.

1850
01:34:08,265 --> 01:34:09,800
[woman] Hilarious.

1851
01:34:10,334 --> 01:34:12,936
That's all right. It's your
van seat. It's not mine.

1852
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:15,272
- So get it on camera.
- How's it?

1853
01:34:15,306 --> 01:34:17,574
- Moment of truth, huh?
- Yeah, look, hey.

1854
01:34:17,608 --> 01:34:20,411
I cashed my check.
