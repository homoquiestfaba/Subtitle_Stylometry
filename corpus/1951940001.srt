1
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,053
Hell, yeah.
This is what I'm talking about, yo.

2
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,097
- Oh, look at this, yo.
- Yeah.

3
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,226
That's what I'm talking about.
Imagine me driving in that.

4
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,568
What? She'd be, like,
"Hey, Jamal, what's up?"

5
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,665
Shut up, bitch!
Remember me last year?

6
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:25,939
Just run 'em all over.

7
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,705
Oh, hell, yeah! What?

8
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,014
With the doors flipping open? Yeah!

9
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,281
But we can't do it
'cause we ain't got no job.

10
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,586
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.
We ain't got no credit, either.

11
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,387
You don't have any credit?

12
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,224
What do you mean,
you got no credit, man?

13
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,594
You're supposed to have credit.
That's the reason why I'm your roommate.

14
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,930
I understand if I don't have any credit. But how
don't you have any credit? You're white.

15
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,799
But I don't have good credit.

16
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:55,363
You're a white dude with no damn credit, man.
What the hell is that?

17
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,705
Dude, it's the first of the month.

18
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,109
First of the month, man?

19
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,182
- Miss... Yo...
- Do you have your half of the rent?

20
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,183
No, I don't have my half of the rent!
You have your half?

21
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,877
No.

22
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,817
I was gonna tell you, but I just...

23
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,412
Well, how you gonna... Wait a minute.

24
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,219
How you gonna ask me if I have my half
and you don't have your half?

25
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:17,285
'Cause I was hoping we could give Mrs. Bundy
your half first and then my half later.

26
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,160
Later, right?

27
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,996
Mrs. Bundy said if we don't have our money,
we are gonna be out on the street.

28
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,070
Homeless.
You want to be homeless, man?

29
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,163
I don't feel like wearing eight coats
and pissing on myself, man.

30
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,175
We just moved here.
What are we gonna do?

31
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,609
Yoo-hoo! Postman! Postman!

32
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,544
Who is it?

33
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:38,208
Yoo-hoo! Postman!

34
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,384
Breaking things.

35
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,589
Yo, man. You got my check, man?

36
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,926
Oh, I am sorry. No check today.

37
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,932
But I wanted to personally
hand deliver those bills

38
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,662
with those cute little red notices on them.

39
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,397
Oh, hell, no. Wait a minute, man.

40
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,700
I gave the money to Dexter
to pay for this, man.

41
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,777
Yeah, well, I guess your acting gig
isn't paying the bills, huh?

42
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,572
Yeah. Toodles!

43
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,081
Yo, man, this is some bullshit, man.

44
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,121
I thought I gave you money
for the gas bill, man.

45
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,487
Yeah.

46
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,358
I forgot to tell you that I
got us an extension on that.

47
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,192
- Oh, did you?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,732
The only extension that's gonna happen
is my foot in your ass.

49
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,233
What's wrong with you, man?

50
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,780
What now?

51
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,680
You know your cable bill
is 60 days past due?

52
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,158
It is? But... I gave money
to my roommate a week ago.

53
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:00,290
Listen, if you want to watch BET tonight,
you better make your payment by 5 p.m.

54
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,962
Jamal, didn't I give you the money
to pay the cable bill?

55
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,230
Um, yeah.

56
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,676
I got us a two-week extension.

57
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,871
Right. Right.

58
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,972
Anyway, that was the money
you'd given me to pay the gas bill.

59
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,895
What?

60
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,124
- See, that was a yell.
- Shut up, man!

61
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,132
Who it be?

62
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,332
What's up, man?

63
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,135
It be the gas man.

64
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,677
We just got the bill in the mail today.
What the hell are you talking about, man?

65
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:51,045
Oh, yeah. We had a technical error
with our computers,

66
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,119
and according to this here,
it says you have to pay us today

67
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,279
or you'll be taking cold showers.

68
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,686
You know what I mean?

69
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,767
What is it now?

70
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,810
It's me, the owner.

71
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,141
The big bambino.

72
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,114
Oh, man!

73
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,118
Jamal, Mrs. Bundy.
What are we gonna do?

74
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,715
Open up.
I know you two are in there.

75
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,724
Hi, Mrs. Bundy.

76
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,726
We're naked right now.

77
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,659
We're taking a shower.

78
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,790
- Why did you say that?
- We're taking a shower!

79
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,868
What?

80
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,594
Are you two gay now?

81
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:49,266
You keep it on the down low?
I watch <i>Oprah.</i>

82
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,809
Yeah. We're naked.

83
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,004
It's hard for us to open the door
when we're naked.

84
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:58,015
We don't have towels, neither,
so we're drying ourselves.

85
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,661
Now, I've seen little whistles
like yours before, boys.

86
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,163
Now listen.

87
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,063
I want my rent,

88
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,102
or you two out on the street,
do you hear me?

89
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,296
Oh, yeah. Wait a minute.

90
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,236
It's 30 days. We still got...

91
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,035
- It's not the end of the month, right?
- We got another day.

92
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,609
It's a leap year.

93
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,974
No. No, no, no.
It's 30 days in this month,

94
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,979
and this is the first of the month.

95
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:32,744
So I want my rent by the end of today.
Do you got it?

96
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,678
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

97
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,018
We're gonna have it, 'cause we're gonna
get our checks today.

98
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,058
- What checks?
- Our checks. Our checks!

99
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,821
- Yes, the checks. Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

100
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,227
They're in... The production company
takes forever to pay.

101
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,767
It's not my problem. Okay, boys?

102
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,200
Okay. Um, all right. Well, we're gonna...

103
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,795
We'll have it for you
at the end of the day.

104
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,203
Bitch.

105
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,534
That's how I roll, baby.
You gotta let 'em know,

106
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,170
because if you don't let 'em know, they're not
gonna know.

107
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,839
I let 'em know.

108
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,510
So I hear you two are twins.

109
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,177
How'd that happen?

110
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,915
Well, I take after my mama.

111
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,923
And I take after my pappy.

112
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,619
I came out first, and...

113
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,561
I came after her.

114
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,825
Let me talk to you for a minute.

115
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,594
Yeah.

116
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,670
Well, you know what?

117
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,864
I could make you a star.

118
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,738
Really?

119
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,174
You've got such a unique look.

120
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,508
I've never seen anything quite like it.

121
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,777
- Oh, wow. Thank you.
- I think it's gonna be your year, baby.

122
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:42,048
- I know. I did win a beauty pageant once...
- Yeah. Excuse me a minute.

123
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,452
- Can I be honest with you?
- Of course you can.

124
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,650
I can make you a star.

125
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,523
Everybody's always told me that.

126
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,028
You've got such a unique look.

127
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,428
I've never seen anything quite like it.

128
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,364
Well, thank you.

129
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,527
It's gonna be your year, baby.

130
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,806
Damn, man.

131
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,535
Damn!

132
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,611
We need jobs, man.

133
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,545
That's what I'm saying.

134
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,506
We should go work for Mad Dog.

135
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,778
Be, like, bang!

136
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,945
What, are you crazy, man?

137
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,682
He's a gangster. What do I look like?

138
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,056
Um, an African-American?

139
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,891
That's funny, man.
Cut with the jokes.

140
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,397
We gotta find a way
to make some quick cash.

141
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,492
We need to be messing
with Gary Coleman's little chunky ass.

142
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,161
He's making cash quick.

143
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,398
Or we could go work for Mad Dog.

144
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,998
Working... What's wrong with you, man?
That's our last resort.

145
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,010
I'm not messing with him, man.
You want to get shot?

146
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,644
Well, what are we gonna do?

147
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,809
Look, we're just two struggling actors
waiting for our big break.

148
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,013
It just hasn't come yet.
But none of those people seem to see that.

149
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,483
Just chill. It will, man.

150
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,392
Jamal, I've been chilling
since I could grow hair on my nuts, okay?

151
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,727
I'm tired of chilling.
I'm busting my ass on every audition...

152
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,391
every one... and nothing has happened.

153
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,332
Excuse me, ladies.

154
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,133
I gotta set up a meeting
for two of my clients for a film.

155
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,800
Angelina, Halle, watch out,
because here come the twins!

156
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,003
Oh, my God, he's so cute!

157
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,876
I know. Oh, honey, we can totally do this.

158
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,974
We're gonna be
the first ones to be rich in our family!

159
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,746
I know!

160
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:24,084
Check it. Maybe it's just not
gonna happen for us.

161
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,650
Okay, um, the part with hair on your nuts?

162
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,388
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I didn't like that.

163
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,522
I thought it might be a little much,
but I was in the moment.

164
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,157
I just went with it.

165
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,325
That's your thing.

166
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,733
But I'm gonna be a star.
I'm gonna make it.

167
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,100
Understand?
Because I got what it takes.

168
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,298
And let me tell you why.

169
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,897
'Cause I'm great. And you know why?

170
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,341
It's taking longer
because greatness takes longer.

171
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,934
- You understand?
- Yeah.

172
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,071
I got what it takes, man.
You understand?

173
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,808
Look.

174
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,747
Perfect teeth, smile.

175
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,615
Boom. Come on, son.

176
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,314
Denzel ain't got shit on me.

177
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,618
- Keep dreaming, Jamal.
- Watch. Whatever.

178
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,249
Keep dreaming.

179
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,224
You're hating. There it is.
That's okay, though, because...

180
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,035
Hello?

181
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,664
Yo, it's Ramon.
Got an audition for you two.

182
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,843
Oh, audition. What's up? All right.

183
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,536
Yeah, you got a car this time?

184
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:24,343
Yeah, we got a ride. Uh, yeah.

185
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,079
Um, yeah. This girl...
She gonna let me borrow her car.

186
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,348
I thought your driver's license
was suspended.

187
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:34,358
Yeah. Yes and no, because...
Um, they said that, uh...

188
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,691
The city said that I could drive
it only when I'm going to work.

189
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,389
You dig? It's, like, some special new law.

190
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,489
I thought you two
were unemployed already.

191
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,431
You ain't booked shit since I signed you.

192
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,504
Right. Yeah. Yes and no.

193
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,630
Because... I mean, we got stuff going.

194
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,766
You know what I mean?
We're doing cool.

195
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,470
Look, man, get a pen before
I drop you from my roster.

196
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,740
All right. All right. Cool. All right.

197
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,942
Okay, what's up? What's hap...
What's happening? Got a pen.

198
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,987
All right. Ready?
6427 Hollywood Way. All right?

199
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,852
You gotta be there at 11:30.

200
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,549
You're meeting
with the producers, all right?

201
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,889
Don't fuck it up.
This is your last chance, all right?

202
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,656
All right. Thanks. Yeah. Peace. Yeah.

203
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,460
That's how I do.
You gotta talk to 'em that way

204
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,968
'cause if you don't
let 'em know, they're not gonna know.

205
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,404
- I let 'em know.
- He reminds me of Jack Nicholson.

206
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,909
Who was that? Was that our agent?
That was our agent, right?

207
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,503
- Got an audition. Yeah!
- We got an audition? Yes!

208
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,140
- For what? A TV show? A movie?
Commercial?

209
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,185
No. No. Guess what.
It's a movie, dawg. Movie.

210
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,413
And it's like a murder movie.
It's called <i>Dead Body.</i>

211
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,853
Awesome. Characters?

212
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,084
Um, your character...

213
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,023
Oh, ooh, you're gonna
be playing a basehead.

214
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,652
- Okay.
- It's perfect for you.

215
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,197
'Cause, you know, you got...
No, it's perfect.

216
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,664
You got the eyes all cracked out.
That's natural for you.

217
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,998
Yeah. And my character...

218
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,934
I play this real smooth, cool dude.

219
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,506
Real handsome, gets all the girls.

220
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,508
That's, like, natural for me,
'cause that's the way I live.

221
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,374
Hey, I don't know.
'Cause these characters are nothing like us.

222
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,573
That's the whole point, dude.
That's why you're an actor.

223
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,513
You know what I'm saying?
That's why it's acting.

224
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,178
That's why we're acting, fool.
You know what I'm saying?

225
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,653
So what would it... It wouldn't make any sense
if we were playing ourselves.

226
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,314
- Then why are we even being actors?
- That's true. You're right.

227
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,858
It's always good when you
can go out of character, you know?

228
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,258
- It's a challenge to be, like, in the character.
- Back into character.

229
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,389
Come on. You, a basehead?
It's gonna be crazy.

230
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,195
- Let's do it! Yeah!
- Yeah!

231
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,997
Yo, no tricks.

232
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,868
You're trying to do that little black handshake.
I'm getting tired of that.

233
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,804
- No, but I just got the snap thing right.
- I don't want that!

234
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,467
- I just got it right!
- That's patronizing.

235
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,771
I don't want to see you snap.

236
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,971
- I don't want to see that pleasure.
- I just got it.

237
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,447
- I'm trying to bring back, you know, the old... -
High five?

238
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,644
I don't want high five.
White dudes love the high...

239
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,187
You high five over everything.
You high five when you br...

240
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,223
I don't want to high five
with you guys anymore!

241
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,884
I went to a white college,
and it was... that's all I had...

242
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,928
Every time I walked into the room,
it was a high five because I was a black guy.

243
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,521
Standard American handshake
means we're even.

244
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,099
- You see what even is? Even.
- Handshake? Sure.

245
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,227
No high fives, either.
I am so sick of high-fiving.

246
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,103
- I won't.
- A modern, standard handshake.

247
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,666
- That's what I like. Let's go! Shit!
- All right. Let's go.

248
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,779
Yeah! It's time for the big time.

249
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,722
We can make it now.

250
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,657
I don't know what they reading for.

251
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,991
I'm taking it from everybody.
What you playing, man?

252
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,429
Come on.

253
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,625
Ooh, hey, you know what?

254
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,292
I don't see any other white boys.

255
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,529
That's a good thing, right?

256
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,208
Can I help you?

257
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,755
Yeah. I'm here for the audition.

258
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,515
Sign in.

259
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,287
Okay. Is that gum good?

260
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,452
Very.

261
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,393
I see. You chewing like it is.

262
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,692
What roles did you come
did you come to audition for?

263
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,098
Relax. Hold up.

264
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:08,469
I'm here for the role of Chris,
the smooth cat, you know?

265
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,135
Yeah, and I'm here for the role of, uh,
basehead.

266
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,542
- What's up, dude?
- Drug head.

267
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,706
Yeah. Check this out.

268
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,646
- Make sure...
- Thank you.

269
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,218
You can get your ass up outta here

270
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,049
before I make it look like a scene
from <i>The Excorcist up in here.</i>

271
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,986
Yo, man, you need to chill with that.

272
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,192
You know, if your tummy hurts,
you could try some, like, Tums

273
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,734
or maybe some...

274
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,861
- I'm gonna go sit down now.
- Go sit down.

275
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,408
I hope I got the sides right.

276
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,342
Well, who cares?

277
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,904
Those guys look like they suck anyway.

278
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,486
Oh, man. This is nothing, man.

279
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,319
This ain't hard.

280
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,724
- This ain't hard at all.
- Oh, yeah. This isn't hard.

281
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,353
But I am.

282
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,692
You what?

283
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,630
Yeah, man, the receptionist. She was hot.

284
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,861
She made me hard.

285
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,530
Man, why don't you
point it that way, man?

286
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,107
- What's wrong with you, man?
- I'm sorry. I can't help it.

287
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,172
We're having problems
with the permits, Spike.

288
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,906
And our budget, too.

289
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,448
I told you, to hell with the permits.

290
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,450
What's wrong with the budget?

291
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,383
We're running out of money.

292
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,719
I told you I just wanted five cars with dubs.

293
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,884
We want the Supertechno crane.

294
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,224
I told you I would throw in my director fee.

295
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,456
We have to get through
these auditions, try to find,

296
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,396
you know, these two guys, and that's it.

297
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,400
I talked to distributors.
They said they're gonna give us

298
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,333
a million-dollar advance for the film

299
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,769
as long as it meets
the total running time.

300
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,841
Yeah, well, that advance
needs to come quick.

301
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,672
All right? Because we're running out of time,
running out of money.

302
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,006
We gotta move on.

303
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,980
Every time we outside,
you see a girl, you get hard.

304
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,674
You see an old lady, you get hard.

305
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,183
You see a midget, you get hard.

306
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,651
You see a damn dog, you get hard.

307
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,586
What's wrong with you, man?

308
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,682
You know what? It's a problem I have.

309
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,261
I have B.W.D.S.

310
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,363
B.W.D. S?

311
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,693
Yeah. Yeah.

312
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,734
Big white dick syndrome!

313
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,829
No, seriously. You know what?

314
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,497
It was originally a black man thing.

315
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,042
- You probably have it. You just don't know it.
- Whatever, dude.

316
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:29,012
We got five more to go.
So let's find these extras that we need

317
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,344
- and get this movie in the can, all right?
- Okay.

318
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,941
'Cause I don't want to go nonunion.

319
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,782
- Never again. Never again.
- Definitely not.

320
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,321
Okay. Here we go.

321
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,754
- Okay, Jessica. How you doing?
- All right.

322
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,024
All right. Camera's rolling. And action!

323
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,032
Just slap the ho, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

324
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,562
Next!

325
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,833
See, like that guy over there.
That Chinese guy.

326
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:59,035
- Yeah. What does he have?
- He has L.C.D.S.

327
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,840
Little Chinese dick syndrome.

328
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:06,407
That's a white man thing.
Yeah, well, you need D.I.T.M.S.

329
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,248
Dick in the mouth syndrome. Shut up.

330
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,886
Hey, man, do we have this guy?

331
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,824
No, I don't have him.

332
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,955
- I have all the girls.
- Not the head shot...

333
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,966
Dee has the ladies.
You're supposed to have the guys.

334
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,434
- Oh. Oh, that's Johnny.
- Johnny. Oh.

335
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,665
- Hey, Johnny! Sorry...
- There you are. Sorry about that.

336
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,174
All right, Johnny. Just be cool.

337
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:36,543
You're a surfer dude, so just be cool,
natural, Miami Beach-type of vibe.

338
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,082
Camera's rolling. And...

339
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,151
action!

340
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,355
Slap the ho. Just slap the ho.

341
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,586
Next!

342
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,631
Look, man, you need to be
studying this, all right?

343
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,757
Just quit bullshitting and study,
all right?

344
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,894
Oh. Oh, okay. Uh...
Listen, that's Brian G.

345
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,767
- You remember Brian G?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

346
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,398
Uh, just be cool, Brian.

347
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,307
This is your big break.
This is your chance.

348
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,312
All right? Camera's rolling.
And action!

349
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,042
Slap the ho!

350
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,911
- I like this one.
- I like the...

351
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,148
- Can you do it again?
- Yeah.

352
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,815
And action!

353
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,085
Slap the ho!

354
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,259
- I like that one.
- Very nice.

355
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,195
You got potential.
We're gonna call you.

356
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,028
- All right.
- Next!

357
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,626
What?

358
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,374
So would that be B.T. S?

359
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,104
- Big tittie syndrome?
- Yeah.

360
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,840
I don't want to slap Mary Magdalene.

361
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,315
I said, I don't want to
slap Mary Magdalene.

362
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,715
Can I get a amen?

363
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,548
Amen. Amen.

364
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,748
- Next!
- Amen.

365
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,386
Man.

366
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,893
Spike Leroy.
What's going on, man?

367
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,895
- Do you know this guy?
- I don't have his head shot.

368
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,591
Yeah. Big Dime. Man, I know
I'm up in there somewhere. Big Dime.

369
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,101
- Yeah, he's...
- Dime? All right.

370
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,035
- Big Dime.
- No. And I remember getting calls.

371
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,970
- There was no Big Dime.
- A'ight. It don't matter.

372
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,838
Anyway, so check this out, Spike.
I'm a big fan of yours, bro.

373
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,380
I seen all your movies...
<i>Eyes of Darkness, JC in the Hood.</i>

374
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,971
So check this out.
I could really relate to <i>JC in the Hood,</i>

375
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,516
so I'm here to pitch a story idea.

376
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,950
See, I grew up in the hood, too.
You know what I mean?

377
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,251
Grew up in the hood.
But my story was different.

378
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,257
I grew up with a white girl.

379
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,190
That movie's been done.

380
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,489
- Yeah, absolutely. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

381
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,259
- <i>Jungle Fever</i> ain't got nothing on that.
- Next!

382
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,300
So what kind of food are we gonna...

383
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,302
- I want soul food for catering, okay?
- Yeah.

384
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,338
- Soul food...
- Been ordered. Everything's there.

385
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,772
- I gave a list.
- I want collard greens,

386
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,240
some macaroni and cheese,

387
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,676
some barbecued chicken,
some barbecued beef...

388
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,543
- I know. I'm feeling you. It's on its way.
- We got it. Don't worry about it.

389
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,777
Spike Leroy likes soul food, okay?

390
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,944
- We got that.
- We took care of it.

391
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,852
Cool, cool, cool.
I know you got my back, Jasmine.

392
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,484
- All right. Let's look at these bozos.
- Okay.

393
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,560
All right.
This is, uh, Kwamé Jenkins.

394
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,861
- What's up?
- So you were in

395
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,198
<i>Boyz n the Hood</i> and
<i>Menace to Society.</i>

396
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:16,070
I can see on your résumé. What other
hood flicks have you participated in?

397
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:19,337
Uh, <i>Lock on the Glock,</i>

398
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,810
uh, <i>No Hos After Midnight,</i>

399
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,711
and, uh, <i>Put It In Your Mouth.</i>

400
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,149
Next! Good-bye.

401
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,159
Just be a minute. Um...

402
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,752
- I don't have his head shot.
- You don't have it?

403
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:42,698
- Uh, all right. Let's give 'em a shot, you guys.
- Okay.

404
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,996
Okay. We're here.
We're supposed to be here.

405
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,001
Yeah. Go.

406
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:49,039
Camera's rolling. And action!

407
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,134
Yo, I smoke weed.
He smokes weed.

408
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,110
We all smoke weed, man!

409
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,579
- What's wrong with that?
- Hell, yeah!

410
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,717
- That's not what we have.
- Uh, no.

411
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,651
Are you sure you're at the right audition?

412
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,053
- You're at the wrong audition.
- I think so.

413
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,319
- What? Dude...
- That's not our sides.

414
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,156
- What are you talking about?
- Next!

415
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,093
- I worked on this all day. Wait.
- Thank you very much.

416
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:15,064
Are we at 2302 West Sunset Boulevard?

417
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:21,970
- No, this is 2302 East Sunset.
- East!

418
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,837
- Sorry, gentlemen.
- Good-bye.

419
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:24,909
Next!

420
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,705
Damn it!

421
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,712
- Good-bye.
- What the f...

422
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,048
Hey, you think you can
give me, like, a scene?

423
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,981
I can...

424
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,111
I don't need him.

425
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,779
Damn it!

426
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,722
- Did you get that aspirin?
- Uh, no.

427
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,384
They didn't give me a P.A. yet.

428
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,292
In fact, can you make sure
she brings it, please?

429
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,126
- Make me feel a lot better.
- Yeah.

430
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,564
Where did those two bozos come from?

431
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:53,365
I don't know, Spike,
but we need to move on, okay?

432
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,337
- Definitely.
- We're taking too much time here.

433
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,271
Let's go. All right.
That's it. That's a wrap.

434
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,004
I gotta move my car, actually.

435
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,587
I can't believe we went
to the wrong address!

436
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,520
I can. We do it all the time.

437
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:18,394
You know what? I think for the first time,
you're finally right.

438
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:22,558
This acting is...
This acting thing ain't for us, man.

439
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,828
I think we should just go
find a regular job.

440
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,370
Yeah. I think you're right.

441
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:30,908
Damn!

442
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,135
Damn!

443
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,713
In order for us to get a job,

444
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:40,842
we gotta get classified ads, so...

445
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,317
- Okay.
- Yeah,

446
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,083
'cause that's the only way
we can find, you know...

447
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,157
Money.

448
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,685
That's what you're here for.
See? I told you.

449
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,888
That's right. I love it.

450
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,828
White dudes come with change.

451
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,593
Love it.

452
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,065
They come with change.

453
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,603
All right.

454
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,436
- Let's go.
- Salvation, baby.

455
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,579
Come on, baby.

456
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,780
Come on, baby, baby, baby, baby.

457
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,858
Come on. Classified,
classified, classified.

458
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,559
Look at that. Check this out.

459
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:30,101
They're hiring over at the Black Diamond
Fitness Center on Crenshaw Boulevard.

460
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,033
Yeah! Some hot ladies going there!

461
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,037
Hot ladies!

462
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,731
- Boobies!
- Yeah, boobies.

463
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,399
- Ugh!
- What?

464
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,069
- Yo, what is...
- What? I got a booger?

465
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,009
Wipe that... Not the booger, man.

466
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,809
Looks like you been tongue kissing
Strawberry Shortcake, man.

467
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,747
- Oh, the doughnut.
- Yeah.

468
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,320
- Yeah. Dude.
- Yeah, man.

469
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,321
Did you ever think
Strawberry Shortcake was kind of hot?

470
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:55,325
- Yeah, but she was 12.
- So was I.

471
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,657
Okay... Oh! Check this one out.

472
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,525
Ah! See? Ah!

473
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:03,590
It says, "We are looking
to hire energetic individuals

474
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,796
who do shipping and receiving
at a clothing company."

475
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,567
That's cool.
And no experience necessary.

476
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,665
- Nice!
- And we ain't got shit.

477
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,300
- That's so coo'.
- Yeah.

478
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,311
I can ship and receive.

479
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,405
- I can do both.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

480
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,543
All these damn jobs,
we gotta get something, man.

481
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:22,847
We gotta get something.

482
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,785
- Coo'.
- There's too many things...

483
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,620
"Coo"'? Wait. Whoa.
"Coo"'? Yo, "Coo"'? Coo'.

484
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,695
"Cool." You can use
the L with me, man.

485
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,786
- Don't cut it off.
- I'm not trying to.

486
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,662
- I told you about that. "Cool."
- I'm sorry.

487
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,361
- All right. Thank you. All right.
- I'm trying to fit in.

488
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,097
What are we gonna do now?

489
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,105
- Gonna go job hunting.
- Right.

490
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,004
Where you want to start?

491
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,703
We're gonna go to Black Diamond
Fitness Center first.

492
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,972
Excellent. How we gonna get there?

493
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,445
We don't have a car.

494
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,315
How else are we gonna get there?

495
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,717
There are other modes
of transportation, man.

496
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,652
- Like the bus!
- Oh, damn!

497
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,225
- I thought you were gonna say helicopter.
- No. That'd be good, though.

498
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,089
- You have a helicopter?
- You know what?

499
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,094
You're not as dumb
as I thought you were, man.

500
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,754
- You're pretty smart.
- Thank you.

501
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,696
- Your IQ points just went up. All right?
- Thank you.

502
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,496
Thank you very much. Wait.

503
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,798
That was an insult. Hey.

504
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,449
Hey. You guys hiring?

505
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,724
No? Not at all?

506
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,492
All right.

507
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,693
No, they're not hiring, either.

508
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,099
Well, wait up.

509
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,474
Hey, where's the bus?

510
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,406
We've been waiting for, like, an hour.

511
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,343
Do I look like a bus schedule, man?

512
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,349
- Yeah.
- What the hell y'all looking at?

513
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,550
You ain't never seen a well-dressed
homeless person before?

514
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,288
Especially with a scarf.

515
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,296
Isn't your, like, neck hot? It's hot.

516
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,229
It's, like, 800 out here. You have a...

517
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,233
Look here, man. It's not a scarf.

518
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,235
This is an ascot.

519
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,036
It smells more like ass-crack.

520
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,439
Look here.
Anyway, y'all want a drink?

521
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:01,478
No. No. No. We're straight.

522
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,377
Oh, good. For a moment, I thought
you was a couple of faggots.

523
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,848
A couple of cocksuckers.
A couple of fugazis.

524
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,943
- No, man. We just didn't want no water, man.
- Nope.

525
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,613
'Cause, you know, you're,
like, you're homeless,

526
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,815
and so your mouth's dirty,

527
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,687
and it's been on that, so I don't want it.

528
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,125
And look here.
I ain't always been homeless.

529
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:20,561
- I had a wife and two kids... two beautiful kids.
- Wow.

530
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,394
What happened?

531
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,491
I lost it. Lost everything.

532
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,093
- Do you got a picture?
- You got a picture of your kids?

533
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,605
We'd like to see 'em, you know.
We don't want to, you know...

534
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,676
Yeah. What'd you used to do?
What were you?

535
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,745
I was an actor.

536
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,076
That is messed up, man.

537
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,013
What... That thing you do
with your tongue... What's that?

538
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,915
That was my thing.
Every time you you'd see me...

539
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,113
- Oh, okay.
- You got a picture of your kids?

540
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,053
I thought you guys would never ask.

541
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,250
- Come take a look at this.
- We didn't want to ask.

542
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,793
- And I wasn't even acting when I did this.
- Okay.

543
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,362
- Let's see that.
- Look at that.

544
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,455
Oh, shit! Wow!

545
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,364
Wow! They are...

546
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,164
Wow, those are your kids.

547
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,498
Yeah, Chuckie and Buckie.

548
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,568
That's right.

549
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:09,204
- What you laughing at?
- What the fuckie?

550
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,906
- What y'all laughing at?
- Chuckie, Buckie...

551
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:13,279
I wasn't laughing at you guys
when you was talking your little shit.

552
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:14,282
Y'all think something's funny!

553
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,717
It's a sunny day out,
and we're just really happy!

554
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,948
What the fuck? What is that?

555
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,389
Shut the fuck up!
'Cause I'll stab my fucking eye out!

556
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,723
- That's what I'm-a do! Watch the eye!
- Where's your sense of humor?

557
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,227
- Where's my sense of humor?
- Yeah.

558
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,798
I lost it with my fucking job!
Now, watch the eye, goddamn it!

559
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,459
- No, please. We're gonna roll.
- We're out. We're out, man.

560
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,001
- What you mean?
- Your kids are ugly!

561
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,095
Wait! I was just acting!
This ain't even a real knife!

562
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,265
Bunch of rookies.

563
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,611
Man, that homeless dude
was crazy as hell, man.

564
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,879
Hell, yeah. What is L.A. coming to?

565
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,265
- Why you calling?
- My mother.

566
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,605
Yeah, that's right. My moms, yo.

567
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,769
Last resort.

568
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,404
I need some money.

569
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,115
Ma? Hey, Ma.

570
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,743
Hi.

571
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,784
Just wanted to say that you're
the best mom in the world.

572
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:29,985
You know, I'm in need, Ma.

573
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,054
I need you to hook me up
with some money.

574
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,725
Yeah, I'm in a tight spot.

575
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:42,366
Yeah, I need some money.
I'm so serious. I need some money.

576
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,805
But that's what I been doing all day.

577
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:53,346
Y-Yeah. I'm... I'm trying real hard.

578
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,281
What'd she say?

579
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,594
She said she love me.

580
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,187
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

581
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:10,597
That's good.

582
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,102
Why don't we ask your parents?

583
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,264
Yeah! We should ask
your parents, man!

584
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,605
Oh, man! That's real money
right there.

585
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,941
- Yeah.
- Jamal, I've told you a hundred times,

586
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,777
I don't know who my parents are, okay?

587
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,580
Oh, well, I... I forgot, man.

588
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,521
What the hell you crying for, though?
Damn!

589
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,527
"I don't know why my parents are."

590
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,223
Just put on the TV.

591
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,093
- Aw, this is my show right here.
- Oh, dude!

592
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,102
- Whup that bitch's ass.
- No. No. Change the channel. Change it.

593
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,035
- Beat her ass!
- I don't want to watch this.

594
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,164
- I'm not watching this.
- Why you hating?

595
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:53,870
- I'm not hating. Ricki Fake is played out.
- Smack her!

596
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,344
- Yo, it's <i>Ricki Lake.</i>
- Get it right. Yeah.

597
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,915
That's what I said.
Put on some <i>Maury Pobitch</i> or something.

598
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,178
It's Povich, all right? Yeah! Go!

599
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,483
- Jamal! Jamal! Jamal!
- Whup her ass! That ain't his baby!

600
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,489
That is not his baby! I knew it!

601
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,492
- Why are you repeating everything I say?
- That's not his baby!

602
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,926
Why?

603
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,521
You're the stupid one, man.
You understand that?

604
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,623
You're the stupid one.
Get that straight.

605
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,830
<i>What up, Cali?</i>

606
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,168
<i>I got a place you can go</i>

607
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,673
- <i>when your dough is low.</i>
- <i>Hey, fool!</i>

608
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,800
<i>Come here. Hold my bike.</i>

609
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,810
<i>Open seven days a week,</i>
<i>and we keep it real.</i>

610
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,540
<i>You know the deal.</i>
<i>It's the place you can go.</i>

611
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,673
<i>When your dough is low,</i>
<i>it's the U.U.O.</i>

612
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,014
<i>Now you know. Yeah, U.U.O.</i>

613
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,950
- <i>Now you know. Come see us on Crenshaw.</i>
- <i>Welcome to U.U.O.</i>

614
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:40,081
<i>You got my gear, fool.</i>
<i>He's paying for mine.</i>

615
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,783
Take it, man.

616
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,793
Where you going?

617
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,126
- Gonna go get me a job.
- Can I come?

618
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,331
See? Came, come.

619
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,372
"Can I come?" And I came.

620
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,169
Dude, I said "Can I come?"
Then I came.

621
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,405
See, this is not a game anymore, man.
It's not a game.

622
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,038
Before, it was hairy balls.
Now it's "Can I come?"

623
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,980
And then you aim it at me.

624
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,677
What's that about, yo? Yeah, man.

625
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,721
I wasn't aiming.
You really can't aim it, can you?

626
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,792
You know what? I'm a roommate,
not a sweet mate.

627
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,326
- What's wrong with you, dude?
- Joking.

628
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,329
That's not a joke, man.
How you joking about coming on somebody?

629
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,398
It's funny.

630
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,467
You know what? I'm out.

631
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,470
Jamal, I'm just playing.

632
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,701
Who's sensitive now?

633
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,838
What? Dude, are you crazy?

634
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,747
This is a woman's clothing store.
They're gonna think we're gay.

635
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,446
No, they're gonna think you're gay
by the way you walk in here.

636
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,455
Shut up and chill, man.

637
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,821
- Hello. May I help you guys?
- Hi. Yeah. Yeah.

638
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,486
Can you tell me where I
can catch the Soul Train?

639
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,291
Just...

640
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,333
Yo, man. He's racist. He's a racist.

641
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,926
You didn't need to say that, man.
The Soul Train?

642
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,029
Yeah. Sorry about him. Excuse him.

643
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,108
He was in a drive-by last year.

644
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,269
You know, had some head trauma,
so he has, like, a racial Tourette's.

645
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,315
Yeah. So, um, I was just...
Wait a minute.

646
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,612
- You look kind of familiar.
- Excuse me?

647
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,550
What, did you fart or something?

648
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,054
- What's wrong with you, man?
- What?

649
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,148
- Shut up.
- You guys look like you are handling it.

650
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,988
No, wait a minute. I just...

651
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,756
We just came here to see
if you had some applications.

652
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,627
To see if you were hir...
Yeah, yeah, some applications.

653
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,169
- For this store?
- No, as Don Cornelius' personal assistant.

654
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,205
- Shut up!
- Of course this store.

655
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,467
- To... Yeah... So... Can you go see?
- I'll be right back.

656
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,634
'Cause I love this store.
You know, I want to...

657
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,804
- show my feminine side, you know?
- I'll be right back.

658
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,314
- Yo, man, come here.
- What?

659
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,045
You say one more thing
to embarrass me, we gonna be fighting.

660
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,587
Okay. All right.
As long as I have, like, <i>Jerry Springer</i> style,

661
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:52,917
and I get the first punch in.

662
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,582
Like...

663
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,126
I'm gonna smash you like
a transexual on <i>Jerry Springer.</i>

664
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,752
- Keep talking.
- Okay.

665
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,845
Sorry, guys. We don't
have any more applications.

666
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,437
- Shut up!
- I didn't say anything!

667
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,948
You were about to. I felt your breath.

668
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,383
Yes, well, thank you very much.

669
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,888
Thank you. Sorry
about the whole, you know.

670
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,686
But I hope that maybe there'll be
an opening or something like that.

671
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,852
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?

672
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,953
- All right. You take it easy, huh?
- Yeah.

673
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,964
Maybe I can get that number, though.
How's that?

674
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,795
- Bye. Have a nice day.
- Okay. All right.

675
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,927
- Bye.
- Maybe I can get the e-mail.

676
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:43,029
- She was nice, huh?
- What about the...

677
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,269
- She was really nice.
- What about the URL, blog or something?

678
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,708
- Damn!
- She was sweet.

679
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,114
What? What's the matter?

680
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,410
I told you, man,
you embarrass me again,

681
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:54,416
- we gonna fight.
- What?

682
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,816
- We're gonna fight.
- No, no, no.

683
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,353
Don't hit me, Jamal.
Please don't hit me, Jamal.

684
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:58,581
Give me a good reason why I shouldn't.

685
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,783
Because I know another
where we can get a job.

686
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,690
You do?

687
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,887
Yeah.

688
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,487
Where? Where? Where?

689
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,395
Follow me. Come on.

690
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,566
So, are you guys hiring?

691
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,611
What? What? Excuse me?

692
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,543
What he was trying to say

693
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,344
is we're wondering if you guys were hiring.

694
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:32,085
This ain't DeVry, motherfucker.

695
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,384
What?

696
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:37,018
This ain't DeVry,
this is... ain't Mackie D.

697
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,153
This a strip club, motherfuckers.

698
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,993
This ain't Mickey D's, none of that.

699
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,124
We were just wondering
if you were hiring, man.

700
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,669
What did I say to you? Didn't...

701
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,642
Did you hear me, fool? I said no!

702
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:55,007
Now, do I have to put
it in Ebonics or some shit

703
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,377
or some Swahili or some shit like that?

704
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:02,384
Then okay. Ooga mooga, motherfucker.
Do you understand that?

705
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,110
Fuck you, then, bitch.

706
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,350
- Oh, hoo-hoo, shit.
- Drunk motherfucker.

707
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,825
Whoa. Oh, sheeet.

708
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,862
Oh. Oh, you know what?

709
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,228
You don't know who you talking to,

710
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:19,497
'cause you're acting like you're
<i>Boyz n the Hood,</i> and shit.

711
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,572
Well, I'm got news for you, motherfucker.

712
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,731
I'm a <i>Menace to Society,</i>
motherfucker,

713
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:27,777
and I will fuck you up the best I could.

714
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,472
Fuck, man. You're breath
is a menace to society.

715
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,982
You spit on me again,
I'll dig my finger in your fucking eye.

716
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,382
Yo, let's get out of here, man.

717
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,420
This is a bad idea, man.
I shouldn't have listened to you.

718
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:40,285
I want to see the show.
I want to see some titties.

719
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:44,225
All right, fellas. Now, you play with fire,
we brought you desire.

720
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:47,161
But now it's time to
put them flames out, baby.

721
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,132
Now, I bring to you the one and only...

722
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:54,000
Miss Spring Cow. Yeah.

723
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,403
Let's go, man.
This is bullshit, man.

724
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,806
Boobies.

725
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,503
Oh, okay. Okay.

726
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:06,078
All right. Yeah.

727
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,707
Ah, let me make it nice and clean.

728
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,446
Let me fold it right.

729
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:11,816
Yeah, huh?

730
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,186
What's this shit, cheap motherfuckers.

731
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,657
Oh, she's lippy.

732
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,751
That's my damn dollar.
That's what the fuck it is.

733
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,523
There's another stripper coming up
over there.

734
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,892
She's got one goddamn leg.
Let's go, man.

735
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:23,364
Oh, my God!

736
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,163
What the fuck kind of
strip joint is this, man?

737
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,728
Oh, man.

738
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,579
I am never going in another
strip club again.

739
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,947
You see that raggedy wrinkled ass?

740
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,883
- That was her ass?
- That was her ass.

741
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,545
It was down to her ankles, man.

742
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,323
We should've never
done this in the first place.

743
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:48,756
I told you it was a bad idea, man.

744
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,520
- I didn't know.
- Damn.

745
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:54,822
She was playing hacky sack
with her titties, man.

746
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,899
Okay, that was too much.

747
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,527
But it's true, man.

748
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,106
What else could you do with titties
hanging all the way down like that?

749
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,731
What are we gonna do now?

750
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,608
I don't know. Let's get out of here, man.

751
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,141
Well, we're back to where we started.

752
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,582
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

753
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,920
You thinking what I'm thinking?

754
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,692
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

755
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,931
Check it, there's one for each of us.

756
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,005
I bet you we could get as far as Stockton
with these things.

757
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,608
Go around!

758
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,206
We're not moving! Go around!

759
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,616
Go around!

760
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,687
Go...

761
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,856
No buses for us!

762
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,391
Right on!

763
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:58,954
Just shut up!

764
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,164
Love it. Shut your mouth
and go around!

765
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,095
Ooh, watch this. Watch this.

766
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:08,034
Oh, yeah!

767
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,876
Where to now, Jamal?

768
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,536
- We should go get some girls, man.
- We should.

769
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,079
Check out my racer, baby.

770
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,877
I know where to. How about coming up
with them scooters?

771
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,815
Man, we're getting scooter-jacked!

772
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:22,851
- That's right.
- Damn!

773
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:23,920
Wait. Okay. We will.

774
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,648
But first, how tall are you, man?

775
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,654
What?

776
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,282
How tall are you, man?

777
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:30,451
6'6".

778
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:33,621
6'6"340, you about 6'6" 240.

779
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:37,223
You know,
the guns are a little bit overkill.

780
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,699
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

781
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,100
You're big as fuck.
We're not gonna mess with you.

782
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,672
There you go. No arguments here.

783
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,240
No arguments here.

784
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,672
But you still in my neighborhood.

785
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,606
- Yeah, you're right.
- We'll leave.

786
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,938
How about you go over there...

787
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,012
You know what?

788
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,740
Yeah, we're out of here.

789
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,112
I'm bored. How about you dance
for us right now?

790
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,980
Yeah. Yeah.

791
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,143
Okay.

792
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,414
How about, uh, yeah.
How about a little soft shoe?

793
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,012
Let me see you tap dance.

794
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,024
Do a little tap dance. Okay.

795
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,320
Come on, white chocolate,
give me something.

796
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:04,826
Yeah. Yeah. Now do the robot.

797
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,422
I am a robot.

798
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:10,261
- Do an Iggy Shuffle.
- That's it right there.

799
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:11,925
Iggy Shuffle, motherfuck...
Do the Iggy Shuffle!

800
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,901
Yeah, do it!

801
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,495
Now move off your fucking ass
out of my neighborhood!

802
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:17,505
Get out of here!

803
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,279
You're too big for it!
Give it back!

804
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,612
That tight-ass sweatshirt!
Give it back! I'll...

805
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,848
We just got scooter-jacked!

806
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,857
Come on! Scooter...

807
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,899
Here we go again.
What are we gonna do now, Jamal?

808
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,298
Hell if I know.

809
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,235
Well, all I know is that all this
job searching is making me hungry,

810
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,172
and all I got is a...
a dollar to my name.

811
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,869
There's a liquor store up the street.

812
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,969
Think I can get something for 99 cents?

813
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,446
No. Can I see that dollar?

814
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,813
But...

815
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,886
I want some Funyuns.

816
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,195
Excuse me boys, can you tell me
where this address is?

817
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,968
I need to find this house
because I'm late for work.

818
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,066
- Work?
- Job?

819
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:29,008
Why do you need to find this address?

820
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,047
Yeah, what for?

821
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,206
Who are you?

822
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,977
My name is Geraldine.
Geraldine Parker.

823
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,484
Oh, well, what are you doing
in this neighborhood?

824
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,111
- Yeah. Wha...
- Excuse me.

825
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,190
What do you do, 'cause you...

826
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,417
Solving crimes?

827
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:43,254
Excuse me, why are you asking
all these questions?

828
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,327
Really, it's none of your business.

829
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,622
- Oh.
- Well...

830
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,629
Well, what do you do?

831
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,222
What do I do? Do you really want
to know what I do?

832
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:51,562
Yes.

833
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:55,799
You know what?
I'm gonna show you... what I do.

834
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,702
Boobies. Big boobies.

835
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,712
Ah, is anybody looking?

836
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:07,079
Oh, is anybody looking?

837
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:11,586
Oh, man.

838
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,590
Is anybody looking?

839
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,587
Now, that's what I do.

840
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,664
Now, can you tell me
where the address is?

841
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,598
It's that way. That way. That way.

842
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,131
Follow the arrow.

843
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,899
Bye, boys.

844
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:33,238
Bye, Miss Parker.

845
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,710
That is a nice...

846
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,849
Hey, maybe we can get
a job in here, all right?

847
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,220
Hey, hold up. Check this out, y'all.

848
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:50,418
Okay.

849
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:51,824
We y'all want to make
this quick cash, or what?

850
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,556
Oh, yes. Like the Gary Coleman quick cash?

851
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,723
All you gotta do is
fill out this application.

852
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:56,891
That's all you need to know.

853
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:59,094
Okay. All right. That kind of hurt.
You didn't have to slam it in my chest.

854
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,602
Yeah, whatever.

855
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:03,537
Okay. What the?
"How many forties can you drink?

856
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:07,338
Can you shoot a fool while driving?
How many..." Oh, wait.

857
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,002
"Do you know how to cook crack?"

858
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,205
There's a recipe for crack?

859
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,246
I don't know how to cook crack.

860
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:12,440
Just fill it out, mark.

861
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,016
That's like Betty Cracker or something.

862
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:16,086
Wait a minute.
This is an application to be a gangster.

863
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,084
- A thug?
- A thug.

864
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:18,279
I'm not trying to be no thug, man.

865
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,287
I don't want to be a thug.

866
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,984
It's not what you want to do,
It's what you have to do.

867
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:25,027
And what you have to do
is fill out this application

868
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,528
before I bust a cap in your ass.

869
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,892
Oh, man.

870
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,023
You got a problem,
we'll but a cap in your ass.

871
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:34,229
They got guns. They got guns.
They got guns.

872
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,898
This ain't <i>The Wizard of Oz,</i> man.
Relax.

873
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,202
They got a gun.
I'm too young to die.

874
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,298
You don't think I know that?

875
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,639
You don't think I know they have guns?

876
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,212
Why you tripping now, huh?

877
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,338
Before, we got jacked,
you weren't tripping the last time.

878
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:46,973
And now why you tripping now, huh?

879
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,574
Well, 'cause before,

880
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,211
they were just jacking us
for scooters, man.

881
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:52,447
These guys are jacking us
for our lives, Jamal.

882
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:53,420
Oh, that's true, that's true.

883
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,924
Okay. So I'm right?

884
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,186
You're right. You're right, man.

885
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,386
Okay, enough of this shit.

886
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,087
You gonna fill out the applications or what?

887
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,596
Okay, wait, relax. Hold on now.

888
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,759
Before you bust a cap in our ass,
you know, we're not gonna do it.

889
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,766
Nice knowing y'all.

890
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:06,927
Let's just smoke these fools.

891
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:07,935
Come on, man.

892
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,801
Hey! Hey, that's one time!

893
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,603
All right! Hey, hey, that's right.

894
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,678
Bust a cap in your ass?

895
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,507
You gotta come up
with something different than that.

896
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:17,511
I'm alive. I'm alive!

897
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,013
That was '93. <i>Boyz n the Hood!</i>

898
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,777
- Jackasses!
- I'm alive!

899
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,715
- What was that?
- I thought I was...

900
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,515
They're coming back!
Jamal, they're coming back!

901
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,350
Relax! They're not coming back.

902
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:45,501
Today's lesson is on Ebonics.

903
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,167
Hey, gentlemen, how can I help you?

904
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:48,403
Yeah, we're here for a job.

905
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,777
You realize this is a tutoring center.

906
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,816
Yeah. We can tutor our asses off.

907
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:54,815
Yeah, I can tutor.

908
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,146
It's not as easy as you think.

909
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,652
Do you have a college diploma?

910
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,154
Man, we been to college.

911
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,348
High school transcript?

912
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:01,617
Yeah, picking up brochures and shit.

913
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:02,987
Two forms of ID? Anything?

914
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,425
- Yeah, we got ID.
- Sure.

915
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,156
Yeah, well, you're gonna
have to take a test, also.

916
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,061
What? A test?

917
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,258
You gotta take a test to work here?

918
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,391
That's correct.

919
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,333
No, that ain't correct. That's wack.

920
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,167
Hey, I'm sorry my information
isn't helpful for you guys,

921
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,537
but, if you please,
I have to get back to work.

922
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,667
Hey, don't do that.
Don't do that with your hands.

923
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,211
This is wack.

924
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:23,677
Shut up, all right?

925
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,679
We just gotta think.

926
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,249
No, I'm not good at that.

927
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,181
- Oh, that's right.
- Yeah.

928
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:33,154
Hey, don't do that to me.
I'll break your fucking hands.

929
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,418
There are seven rules to Ebonics.

930
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,989
Rule number 1:
You can get rid of "to be".

931
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,160
You can get rid of that.
For instance, uh,

932
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,294
"She sick today,"

933
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:50,498
or "They talking 'bout your ass".

934
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,474
Rule number 2: Replace all nouns,

935
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,410
or you can repeat nouns
and follow them with a pronoun.

936
00:46:56,513 --> 00:47:01,041
For instance, "My fathah,"
parentheses "My father,"

937
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,780
comma, "he smoke blunts."

938
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,721
Rule number 3:
You can get "do" out of there, too.

939
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,190
You can take that out of your sentences.

940
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:12,558
For instance,
uh, "What you say about my momma?"

941
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,164
Jamal?

942
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,734
What?

943
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,862
I'm still thinking.

944
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,642
Rule number 5:
Get rid of the verb tenses.

945
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,373
Get that out of there, too.

946
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:35,417
For instance, um, let's see,

947
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,488
"I know it's good shit if she tell me".

948
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:42,616
Oh, damn. Today just
isn't our day, Jamal.

949
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:45,820
Hey, man, I didn't know that finding
a job would be so damn hard!

950
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,863
This is some bullshit, man.

951
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:48,932
It sucks.

952
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:54,393
Also, you want to use the same verb
for all subjects.

953
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,200
For instance, "I go," "You go," "He go,"

954
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,070
"She go," "we go," "They go."

955
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:00,609
You know, et cetera.

956
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:06,115
Rule number 6:
Use few long vowels and diphthongs.

957
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,946
For instance, it's not "all right,"

958
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,349
it's "a'ight".

959
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,684
And it's not "What time is it?"

960
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,222
"Do you have the tahm?"

961
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:18,556
Tahm. T-A-H-M.
Tahm, not time. Tahm.

962
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:23,395
Okay. Also, you want to get rid of the "R"
out of most of your words.

963
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,594
For instance, you don't
want more, you "want mo".

964
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,330
You ain't looking for some reefer,

965
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,338
you looking for some "reefah."

966
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,707
Man.

967
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,385
Damn, Jamal. What are we gonna do?

968
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:46,581
We've been looking for a job all day.

969
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,784
So far, we haven't found a damn thing.

970
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:51,155
I don't know, man.

971
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,592
So what are we gonna do?

972
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,664
I'm still thinking.

973
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,904
"Damn, those some tight wheelz."

974
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:07,874
Wheelz-uh. "Z."

975
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:11,505
"Damn, she got skillz." Got it?

976
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,675
Also, you can take the "TH" out

977
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,277
and replace that and spell it
with a "D" or an "F."

978
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:21,482
For instance, it's not "this," T-H-I-S.

979
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:25,220
It's "dis." You can also use it
for "those," too.

980
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,660
You can use this right here.

981
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:30,130
Also, you ain't from "the dirty south,"
S-O-U-T-H,

982
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:34,260
you from "the dirty souf."
"Souf." Fff. Got it?

983
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:37,101
"F." Not "TH" at the end, "F."

984
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,074
And those are the seven
rules of Ebonics.

985
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:41,804
Any questions?

986
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:49,178
Wait. Yo.
I just came up with something.

987
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,913
I got an idea.

988
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,148
Well, what is... What is it?

989
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,451
What... You... Tell me.

990
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,997
A church? What...

991
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,435
How are we gonna get a job at a church?

992
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,665
We're not getting a job
at a church, stupid.

993
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:11,672
- We're not?
- No.

994
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,174
Well, what are we doing here?

995
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:14,402
We're gonna pray for one.

996
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,478
- Hello?
- Yeah.

997
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:18,173
Sure, you can do that at a church.

998
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,339
Yes. Let's go.

999
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,974
Pray that I don't beat your ass before you...

1000
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:44,505
Hello, my sons.

1001
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:47,133
Welcome to the house of God.

1002
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,769
Wow, God has got a nice crib.

1003
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:56,115
And now how may we help you
scrape yourself off of hell's floor?

1004
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,211
Uh, well, uh, Father...

1005
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,449
Well, Fathers, since there's two of 'em.

1006
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,547
[chuckles]

1007
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:03,921
Jamal's got two daddies.

1008
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,221
Shut up.

1009
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:08,058
Continue, my son.

1010
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:12,261
Um, uh, you know, we're just, uh,

1011
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,735
me and my homeboy,
two struggling actors,

1012
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,567
you know, trying to make it, and, uh,

1013
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,573
we've been struggling for such a long time,

1014
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,576
and it's just not working.

1015
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:23,168
We haven't found shit, you know?

1016
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,519
Kumbaya, my Lord

1017
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,280
Kumbaya

1018
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,490
I'm sorry. Forgive me. Sorry.

1019
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:38,726
So, um...

1020
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,023
Continue.

1021
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,028
I was wondering...

1022
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,189
- We.
- What?

1023
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:43,288
We were wondering.

1024
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,392
Oh, yeah, we were
wondering if you could

1025
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:49,063
pray for us, you know, pray for us

1026
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,106
and help us become successful.

1027
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:56,869
My shuns... sons,

1028
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,007
good things come to those who wait.

1029
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,685
That's a toughie.

1030
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,688
I can't get you...
I can't get with you on that one,

1031
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,054
um, Fathers, because, um,

1032
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,354
it's hard to believe because,
I mean, we've been in...

1033
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,452
I've been struggling since I was 13.

1034
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,531
Okay, I've been in this business
since I was 13.

1035
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,293
I mean, come on, you know what I mean?

1036
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,368
I haven't had one speaking line,

1037
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,664
one speaking line in not one movie,

1038
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,398
okay, and look at me.
And I'm big now.

1039
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:28,171
And so, I don't think
I'm gonna be a movie star.

1040
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,303
I just...
I can't get with you on that one.

1041
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,381
Yeah, I absolutely agree with Jamal

1042
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,712
because it's, like,
you know, I remember

1043
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,276
I'm born, and it's like
the next thing I know, bang.

1044
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:41,050
I'm in my mid-twenties,
and I'm still a virgin.

1045
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:45,194
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

1046
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:50,426
We will pray for you,
if that's what you want.

1047
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,967
- Yes, yes.
- Yes.

1048
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:53,535
And let it be a good prayer.

1049
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,197
I mean, a prayer that has to do
with Hollywood and stuff.

1050
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:57,898
Yeah, not like, some, like...

1051
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,100
We don't need to eat or anything.

1052
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,369
Come forward.

1053
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,707
Let us bow our heads for prayer.

1054
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:05,870
- Okay.
- Okay.

1055
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:11,412
I would like to do something special
for you two lads.

1056
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,388
Demons!

1057
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,896
Heresy!

1058
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:26,092
Lunacy!

1059
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,570
And any other ill parasites
that might be living in there.

1060
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,302
Be gone!

1061
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,238
You're supposed to be healing us?
What was that?

1062
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:39,713
Sorry, chaps. Sorry, sorry.

1063
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,250
What... You broke my neck, man.

1064
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:45,947
Anyway, anyway,
off to the unemployment office.

1065
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,951
The unemployment office!

1066
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,585
Yeah, man, you...
I should kick... Man!

1067
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:54,425
Come outside this...

1068
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:56,362
Don't fall in the manhole.

1069
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:01,936
Cheerio. They can help you.

1070
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,233
Love and kisses.

1071
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:06,241
Your hand stinks.

1072
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:25,587
Uh, sir, for this, you're going to need
to take a drug test, please.

1073
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:28,459
What? Nah. I can't take a drug test.

1074
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:32,626
I smoke too much weed for this, girl.

1075
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,601
Damn, you fake-ass Marley.

1076
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:36,603
What?

1077
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:40,437
Chill man. Look. Unemployment office.

1078
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,306
I can feel it. We're gonna get a job here.

1079
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,209
'Cause they handle
everything for you here.

1080
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,406
Everything. You don't
even have to do anything.

1081
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:46,846
They just give you a job. That's it.

1082
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,247
We should've come here first.

1083
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:51,252
That's true, but I have a problem
with unemployment office.

1084
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:54,050
Man, that sounds like
an office with no job.

1085
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:56,523
It should be employment office
so it gives you hope.

1086
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,389
Jamal Overton? Dexter Williams?

1087
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:01,623
- Yes, right here.
- Here.

1088
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,130
- Hi.
- Hello.

1089
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:04,427
You guys are here for a job, right?

1090
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:07,025
This is the unemployment office, isn't it?

1091
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,196
Don't get smart with me.

1092
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,434
I throw smart asses
like you in the trash.

1093
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,740
Now, what type of job are you here for?

1094
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:18,780
Uh, well, personally,
I am looking for a blow job.

1095
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:19,940
How much do you charge?

1096
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,018
Yo, man. Cool out.

1097
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,642
- I'm sorry. That was...
- That was a good one.

1098
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,149
Don't make me call
my man Ray-Ray up here.

1099
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:30,283
He just got out of jail 20 minutes ago,
and I can have him here in five.

1100
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:31,291
- Whoa.
- What?

1101
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:32,418
You do not want to meet Ray-Ray.

1102
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,929
Okay, we don't want
to be beaten by Ray-Ray.

1103
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:35,929
I will call my man.

1104
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,192
I'm sure he's a tough guy.

1105
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,358
Oh, he's real tough.

1106
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,527
I mean, Ray-Ray. He's double trouble.

1107
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:41,535
Two names. Yeah, two names.

1108
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:42,536
Don't want to get killed by Ray-Ray.

1109
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:43,537
Jobs, what kind of jobs can we have?

1110
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,834
Yes, can we have a job, please?

1111
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,568
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1112
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,541
- What types of jobs?
- The ones where you get paid.

1113
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,408
What types of education
do you gentlemen have?

1114
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:53,175
College? High School? Elementary?

1115
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,841
Yes, we've been through all of them.

1116
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:55,849
- Sure.
- Yes.

1117
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:57,351
Very educated.

1118
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,684
- Now we're talking.
- Okay.

1119
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,484
- One second, please.
- Look at the way I sound.

1120
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,525
I laugh educated.

1121
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,293
I laugh "Ha ha."
I use my ha's when I laugh.

1122
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:11,060
Talking about insulting me,
saying I'm not educated.

1123
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,366
Ray-Ray. Two of 'em. Two Ray's.

1124
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:16,370
He must be double...

1125
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:17,940
I have three jobs available.

1126
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,133
Three jobs?

1127
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:22,439
The highest paying job
is The Blue Oyster Bar on Santa Monica.

1128
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:26,709
All you need is blue biker shorts,
and it's 7.75 an hour.

1129
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,478
And we're not trying to be
touched in the ass,

1130
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:30,848
so we're not gonna take that.

1131
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,683
You guys must not
want to make any money.

1132
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:33,881
You want jobs, right?

1133
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,651
We must not want to get butt screwed.

1134
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:37,727
- That's what we don't want.
- No.

1135
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,294
- Exit only.
- Don't want that.

1136
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,829
Exit.

1137
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,160
Next job I have,

1138
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,927
Slawson's Swap Meet, Tips and Toes.

1139
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,832
I don't think so. Do I look that ghetto?

1140
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,131
I don't even know what that is.

1141
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,763
Exactly.

1142
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:52,364
You see what I'm saying?
I try to come to work,

1143
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:54,102
I'm trying to help you guys out.

1144
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,509
Ghetto is not a bad thing.
Ghetto is work,

1145
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,206
which you guys don't have right now.

1146
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,078
Ghetto is you,
and I'm getting sick of it.

1147
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,277
Ghetto is just not only a word.

1148
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:06,378
What is it?
It's a place, and you live there.

1149
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,650
I know.

1150
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,023
You thought that...
I don't live in that neighborhood.

1151
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:14,494
Well, I do, and don't make me
call Ray-Ray up here,

1152
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,963
'cause he just got out of jail,
and I will call him.

1153
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,397
- Well...
- Do not offend me, okay?

1154
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:19,490
I'm sorry, I don't want to...

1155
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,934
I'm trying to get you a job now,
but do not piss me off.

1156
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:23,437
We don't want to get beaten by Ray-Ray.

1157
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,666
Just calm down.

1158
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,435
What's the last job?

1159
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:28,374
Don't make me...
Don't make me call him.

1160
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:29,376
Don't call Ray-Ray.

1161
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:30,503
I just got him out of jail.

1162
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,671
I just bailed him out of jail.

1163
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,577
Okay, we got it.

1164
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:33,580
What's the last job?

1165
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,207
The last job is $6,
take it or leave it.

1166
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:36,342
We'll take it.

1167
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,852
Have a good day.
Thank you very much.

1168
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,581
Tell Ray-Ray. Sounds serious.

1169
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:41,350
I'll whoop Ray-Ray's ass.
That's what I'll do.

1170
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,824
Girl, you know, these boys just
came in here, talking harassment.

1171
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,837
Hello. Welcome to Booty Burger,
where our motto is

1172
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,805
"If it isn't juicy, it isn't Booty."

1173
00:57:58,908 --> 00:57:59,966
Can I take your order?

1174
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:04,172
Yeah, can I have
a Booty Burger with cheese,

1175
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,771

1188
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:38,848
Well, you can't quit.

00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:41,381
Why are you quitting?

1191
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:42,382
This shit ain't me.

00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:43,975
Well, this job is all we got.

1193
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,952

00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,852

1199
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:59,433
It's gonna be a while. I'm not
authorized to use the fry machine.

1200
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:19,919
Jamal! Wait up! D...

1201
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:23,049
I don't know why I'm friends
with him sometimes.

1202
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:24,683
Wait!

1203
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:34,295

00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,964
Yeah.

1208
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,982
Ah, man, my agent
didn't even call, man.

1209
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,576
Damn!

1210
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,752
Whoa, what's up, man?
What you doing here?

1211
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,192
Well, I decided if you was gonna quit,
I was gonna quit.

1212
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:02,696
Wouldna leave ya hanging.

1213
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,096
All right, man.

1214
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,566

1215
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:07,897
Sorry, sorry.

1216
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,403
You know what I was
thinking about, man?

1217
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,105
I was thinking we should
work for Mad Dog, man.

1218
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,804
This job search shit, man,
this ain't working, man.

1219
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:18,471
It ain't working. You know.

1220
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,482
I think you were right before.

1221
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:24,781
I think I'm ready to work for Mad Dog.

1222
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,253
It's time to make some real money.

1223
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,018
I hear what you're saying, man.

1224
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:32,288
I'm tired of all this job searching,
you know what I'm saying?

1225
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:34,863
I want to kill everybody

01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:35,931
<i>Sí.</i>

1227
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:39,126
I want to get some girls,
get a nice car.

1228
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,964
And some other things.

1229
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:44,039
And I want to talk like this
for a couple of months.

1230
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,131
That's what happens
when you make money.

1231
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:48,107
You start to talk like that.

1232
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,611
Let's get out of here
and go work for Mad Dog.

1233
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:53,238
- Let's go, man.
- Yeah, let's go.

1234
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,180

That's what I'm talking about?

1246
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:27,138

01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,260

01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:00,073
Man, enough with the jokes, man.

01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:01,404

1280
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:04,105

1285
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:15,918
Well, I need both of y'all foolios

1286
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:20,189
to sell a couple packages for me
on 87th and Crenshaw.

1287
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,194
Yo, yo. Hell, no.

1288
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,286
No.

1289
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:24,628
87th and Crenshaw?
Are you crazy, man?

1290
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:27,430
What? What I do?

1291
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:30,097
Yo, we don't go that route, all right?

1292
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,572
87th and Crenshaw, man.

1293
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,267
Fine, suit yourselves.

1294
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,072
Good luck on finding a job.

1295
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,908
I heard Booty Burger's hiring.

1296
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:41,481
Yeah, we already heard about that.

1297
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:45,543
Why don't you let Smokey's lazy ass
do that shit for you, man?

1298
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,384
Yeah, why don't you let Smokey do it?

1299
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:52,086
Because I need Smokey
to guard the door at all times.

1300
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:55,062
This ain't Beverly Hills or some shit.

1301
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,961
This is Bone Hills, remember?

1302
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:02,469
Yeah, but... Yeah.
Thanks, but no thanks.

1303
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,403
Wait. Wait a minute.

1304
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,839
Where do you think y'all going?

1305
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:07,875
What, man?

1306
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:09,774
I know the procedure.

1307
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,744
Every time you come
and go at my crib,

1308
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,476
get high, then good-bye.

1309
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:17,909
Do we have to do it, man?

1310
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,045
Yo, don't question him.
Just smoke it.

1311
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:22,181
Get your hands out of my face, man.

1312
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,020
Smoke that.

1313
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,957
I don't even smoke blunts, man.

1314
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:29,998
Yo, man, I'm getting tired of you.

1315
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:31,225
I'm tired of this...

1316
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,598
I can't believe we're getting run
by a stupid little doll, man.

1317
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,001
You little black-ass termite.

1318
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:42,706
Yeah, man. Yeah.

1319
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,413
That's what I'm saying.

1320
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:52,150
Yo, man.

1321
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:56,455
What y'all bitches looking at?

1322
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:03,759
That's your bitch, motherfucker.

1323
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:04,924
Ah, man.

1324
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:05,932
That was...

1325
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:24,916
Shit.

1326
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,784
This is some bullshit, man.

1327
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:29,789
Seriously, man.

1328
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:33,191
This can't get any bullshitty... er.

1329
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:39,868
Look. See that? This dude right here?

1330
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,300
No.

1331
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,638
He's slow.

1332
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,247
The delivery places are always hiring.

1333
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:56,682
We should get a job there.

1334
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:57,844
You got a point.

1335
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,512
Let's just wait till he gets back.

1336
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,180
Beats the hell out of Booty Burger.

1337
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,655
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1338
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,024
Hey, hey, hey. What's up, man?

1339
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,899
Uh, you're working for that
Eminem soul food place, right?

1340
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:16,903
Yeah? So?

1341
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:17,904
You're a delivery guy?

1342
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:19,167
- Yeah.
- So...

1343
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,401
Yeah, are they hiring?

1344
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:21,601
You know what I'm saying?

1345
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:22,609
All the time.

1346
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:23,770
- Word?
- Cool.

1347
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:25,574
You don't have to take a test, do you?

1348
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:26,705
'Cause I choke on tests.

1349
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,717
What test you going to take
to take a bag to a damn house?

1350
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,252
Guys, it's not ITT Tech.

1351
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:32,378
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

1352
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:33,716
ITT Tech, that's a good school.

1353
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,654
I went...
I went for, like, a semester.

1354
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:37,385
- He flunked out, though.
- Yeah. Relax.

1355
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,482
That's a good school.

1356
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,585
How did you get this job, man?

1357
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:41,628
My Uncle Tookie.

1358
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:42,755
- Your Uncle Tookie?
- Yeah.

1359
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:47,693
So you basically got hooked up
without having to work hard, huh?

1360
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:49,634
So we can get a job there, huh?

1361
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,229
It's just right here off of Crenshaw.

1362
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,307
We're not related to Tookie.

1363
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:53,739
Don't trip.
We need people right now.

1364
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,401
You're gonna hookie us with Tookie?

1365
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:56,671
- Yes. Hook you with Tookie.
- Cool.

1366
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:58,110
We're gonna be hookie with Tookie.

1367
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,841
- Cool. That rhymes.
- So do we have to be...

1368
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,007
Yo, why don't you...

1369
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,675
why did you change your shoes, dude?

1370
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,480
They were too small. They hurt my feet.

1371
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:05,918
- I got blisters...
- All right, man...

1372
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,148
Wait, wait, dude.

1373
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:08,814
Look at his shoes.
They're fucking dirty.

1374
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:09,948
Do you let them...

1375
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,390
Maybe he'll work in the kitchen.

1376
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:12,586
He'll work in the kitchen?

1377
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,593
- I'll...
- Right down...

1378
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:14,788
You can't... Man, come on...

1379
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:15,989
All right, should be gone.

1380
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:17,258
All right. Okay. Cool.

1381
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,197
You can give us a ride?

1382
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,632
Yeah, that would be all right.

1383
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:21,998
Why are you stuttering, dude?

1384
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:25,767
'Cause I told you, I was off of Crenshaw,
but I'll give you guys a ride.

1385
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,308
Okay, don't drop us off anywhere around...

1386
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,809
Nah, it's cool.
It's a safe neighborhood.

1387
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:30,003
Lot of gangsters out here.

1388
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:31,272
All right.

1389
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,507
Am I wearing a...
Is this a color of a gang?

1390
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:34,514
No.

1391
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:36,278
- All right.
- Let's move.

1392
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:52,658
Can I help you guys?

1393
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,929
My deliveryman says you're applying
for the driver position.

1394
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:58,803
Yeah. He said you guys were hiring,
so we're ready to be hired.

1395
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:02,503
Yeah, we are, but there's
only one position.

1396
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:03,509
We'll take it.

1397
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:04,579
We'll take it.

1398
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,704
Both of you?

1399
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:06,907
- Yeah.
- Who needs two positions?

1400
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,415
Right? With one, it makes it easier.

1401
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:10,144
So how are you going to split it?

1402
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,446
What...

1403
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:14,921
Yeah. I mean, I'll do, like, one hour,
and he'll do, like, an hour...

1404
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:17,322
Or... Or you can drive
there, and I'll drive back.

1405
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,791
So you do have a car.

1406
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:20,828
No.

1407
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,158
- No?
- No.

1408
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,390
Driver's license?

1409
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,697
Negative, nope.

1410
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:28,565
All right.

1411
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:31,299
You do know this is
a driver position.

1412
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,773
How do you expect
to deliver soul food

1413
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:38,005
if you don't have a car
or a driver's license?

1414
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,608
The bus.

1415
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,711
That's good. That's a good one.

1416
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:46,947
Yeah.

1417
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:49,685
Oh...

1418
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:22,950
Yeah!

1419
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:40,535
Man...

1420
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,474
Where are we going.
We need a job.

1421
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:43,772
What are we going to do?

1422
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:45,574
I don't know, man.
I'm still thinking, man.

1423
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:46,670
Just...

1424
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,248
Look over there.

1425
01:09:57,326 --> 01:10:00,090
Hey, boys. Hey.

1426
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:03,822
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1427
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:05,093
Yeah. I sure am.

1428
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,465
I'd like to go over there and be like...

1429
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,536
Ms. Harrison's fine.

1430
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,201
Man, chill with that, man.
It's nasty.

1431
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:17,370
What?

1432
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,037
Look like you're having a seizure, man.

1433
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,479
You're right. That was... I'm sorry.

1434
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:21,914
I'm not talking about that, man.

1435
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:23,848
Except I'd like to go over and made...

1436
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,648
I'm talking about him right there.

1437
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:27,312
Yeah.

1438
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,584
Wait a minute, Mr. Postman.

1439
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,464
You're looking at me, punk?

1440
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:40,967
Ain't nobody fucking else is.

1441
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,731
You must be looking at me.

1442
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:46,139
Come on, punk.

1443
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,005
Do something, punk.

1444
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,168
Who is this?

1445
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:50,836
My friend's father,
who owns a gun shop,

1446
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,470
so he should have a job for us.

1447
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:53,513
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

1448
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:54,514
Excuse me, sir?

1449
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:58,818
Jamal?

1450
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:01,547
Jamal? Jamal?

1451
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,657
Go on!

1452
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:10,857
- Get out of here.
- No!

1453
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,797
It's not worth staying.
Get out of here!

1454
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:14,630
I'm not leaving you. No!

1455
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:15,795
No!

1456
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,767
Why did you shoot my friend?

1457
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:22,036
Why? He didn't do anything to you.

1458
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,112
Why? Give me your phone.

1459
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,220
Hi. I'm Lisa. What city, please?

1460
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:35,313
Uh, my friend's been shot!

1461
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:39,758
Uh, sorry, sir. I...
I have no listing.

1462
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:42,160
Bi-Bitch! My friend has been shot!

1463
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,459
Excuse me?

1464
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:48,662
What about my friend has been shot
do you not understand?

1465
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:49,863
Am I speaking English?

1466
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:54,306
Sir, I think you're trying to reach 911.

1467
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:57,742
Oh. What number is this?

1468
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,711
411.

1469
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,407
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

1470
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:02,848
That's totally...
That was my fault.

1471
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:03,975
I'm sorry about that.

1472
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,179
No problem.

1473
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:07,687
Okay, Cool.

1474
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:14,020
Hi. Lisa. What city, please?

1475
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:16,723
Yeah, hi, Lisa. It's me again.

1476
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:17,992
Uh, what was that number?

1477
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:22,493
Uh, 911, sir.

1478
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,470
911. Got it, got it.

1479
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:26,905
Cool. Thank you, thank you.

1480
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,341
Hey, what... what are you doing?

1481
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:31,913
That nigger gonna be okay.

1482
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,276
What... He... Did...

1483
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:35,407
You... God... Die!

1484
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,144
Die!

1485
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:38,685
Die!

1486
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:40,880
You motherfucker, die!

1487
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:42,513
Die.

1488
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:44,615
That's paint.

1489
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:46,160
It's paint.

1490
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,491
Hey. Hey, man,
what the fuck are you doing?

1491
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:51,556
- Jamal?
- What the fuck are you doing?

1492
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,066
Jamal, you're alive!

1493
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:54,931
Yeah, it's paint! Paint, man!

1494
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,368
You're alive! Oh, you're alive!

1495
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:57,370
You're alive!

1496
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,532
You're freaking on me, man! Stop!

1497
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:01,871
I was going to tell your friend
it's a paint gun.

1498
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:03,069
I thought you were dead.

1499
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:04,440
Ah, man, no, man.

1500
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:05,706
- It's good acting, right?
- Yeah.

1501
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:06,906
Liked that, huh?

1502
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:08,209
Yeah.

1503
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:09,579
Act my ass off. I was like,

1504
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,016
"Get... Ohh, get outta here" and shit.

1505
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,917
You saw me die, like, eight times.
Shit.

1506
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:14,682
- I studied that shit.
- That was good.

1507
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,121
Dying and shit, yeah.

1508
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,159
So, uh... that would be...
You hiring, man?

1509
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,285
- Nope. No openings.
- Fuck.

1510
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,694
All right. I'm sorry
about the whole choking thing.

1511
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:25,062
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I have anger issues.

1512
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,397
Yeah, next time,
I'll be busting a cap on your ass.

1513
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,300
- Okay, then.
- Okay, Barry White.

1514
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,895
What the fuck is the deep voice for?

1515
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:33,805
That was good acting, huh?

1516
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,241
He cocked and got shit on me!

1517
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,309
This paint ball shit hurts!

1518
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,011
- Shit!
- Quit crying.

1519
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,314
Where are we going?

1520
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,822
I don't know, but I gotta go home
and change, man.

1521
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,448
I can't go to a job looking like this.

1522
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:52,151
What do you mean?
It's... The day's almost over.

1523
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,388
I don't care!
I'm not gonna go looking like this!

1524
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:55,394
Look! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1525
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:56,930
- Hey. I got an idea.
- What?

1526
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:58,499
There's a laundromat
around the corner.

1527
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,067
Why don't we go there,
and we can clean your shirt.

1528
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:01,261
All right, fine. Let's go.

1529
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:02,997
All right. Let's go.

1530
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:08,074
Look, Spike, the budget
won't let us shoot that scene again.

1531
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:10,168
- Okay? We're way over already.
- Right.

1532
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,837
I know, I know, but look.

1533
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,938
Jasmine, I like these.

1534
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,779
Remember those two guys
that came last at the audition?

1535
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:17,852
- There's something about 'em.
- What?

1536
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,648
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1537
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:20,779
Look at this!

1538
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:23,414
Look at this!

1539
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:25,015
Come on, now.

1540
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:29,154
Spike, he did not play the lead
in <i>Jerry Maguire!</i>

1541
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:32,722
I know, but this is the last day
of principal photography.

1542
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,166
We have to get this shot.

1543
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:35,964
Jasmine, you know I talked
to the distributor.

1544
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:38,062
They said if we don't turn in 82 minutes,

1545
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:40,141
we're not gonna get
the million-dollar advance,

1546
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:42,733
so we have to give
these two bozos a break.

1547
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:44,608
The last 50 actors said no.

1548
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:45,702
I know. I know.

1549
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:46,838
I... I just...

1550
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:48,644
Look. Please. Jasmine. Please.

1551
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,513
Just place the call. Dee, look,

1552
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:53,383
we can take the budget out of
the next films to make up for it.

1553
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,922
But let's give these guys a break.

1554
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:56,547
It's only a couple thousand dollars.

1555
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,285
You know what I'm saying?
What's a couple thousand dollars?

1556
01:14:58,393 --> 01:14:59,690
What's a couple thousand dollars?

1557
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:00,853
"A couple thousand dollars," he says.

1558
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,157
Place the call. Place the call.

1559
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:05,130
All right. So I'll call this guy,

1560
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:06,701
- you call that guy.
- Okay. Fine.

1561
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:11,763
- Yeah, son.
- Where the hell is my phone?

1562
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:14,240
Yeah, son.

1563
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:15,241
Hey, give me that.

1564
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,242
- What?
- It's my phone.

1565
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,277
Gimme my phone.

1566
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:18,744
- This is a big-ass phone.
- Yeah.

1567
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,405
Looks like a damn walkie-talkie.

1568
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,541
10-4. Breaker breaker.
This is Go Legal.

1569
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,243
Go Legal, can you hear me?

1570
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,812
You didn't prepay
any of my prepaid minutes.

1571
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:32,983
Yeah. I got Nextel mailing me
a phone today.

1572
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,154
They gonna send it today,
and it looks like a real phone,

1573
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,027
not a walkie-talkie. So...

1574
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:38,565
Okay. Whatever. Yeah. Okay.

1575
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,965
You couldn't even get a
prepaid phone with your credit.

1576
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,939
That's a good one.

1577
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,269
You know what I'm gonna do
with this big-ass phone?

1578
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:48,604
Whatcha gonna do, Go Legal?

1579
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:49,802
Yeah. I'm gonna call our agent,

1580
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:51,379
have him come meet us out back

1581
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,175
so we don't have to deal with Mrs. Bundy.
How 'bout that one?

1582
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:54,180
Smart guy.

1583
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:55,841
Okay. Copy that.

1584
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:57,919
10-4. Breaker, breaker, Go Legal.

1585
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:04,386
Uh... my minutes are up.

1586
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,530
Look like my wing's real tired.

1587
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:09,654
Can't do nothing about that.

1588
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:14,629
It's so exciting.

1589
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:15,703
Excuse me, ladies.

1590
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,033
Not till the check clears.
Can I help you?

1591
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:22,367
Yeah, right.

1592
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:24,879
How much?

1593
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:28,982
We'll be there in two hours.

1594
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:30,642
All right.

1595
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:33,220
Ladies... let's go make some money.

1596
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,201
Oh, yo. Door.

1597
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:49,463
That might be it.

1598
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:51,038
Might be my phone, boy! Yeah!

1599
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:52,037
Yes!

1600
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,334
Who is it?!

1601
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,966
Special delivery.

1602
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:55,975
Yes, sir!

1603
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:57,511
Come on in!

1604
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,080
Come on in.

1605
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:01,012
- Hurry up, man.
- Yeah.

1606
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:02,811
Uh, yeah.
I got a package for Jamal?

1607
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:04,943
That's me right there! Jamal!

1608
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:06,918
Yeah!

1609
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,189
Yo, why is my...

1610
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,055
Why is my box open, dawg?

1611
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,185
I don't know, man.
I'm just here to...

1612
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,263
How the hell don't you know?

1613
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:18,527
You the only one with it, man.
That's a federal offense!

1614
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,603
Opening people's mail's
a federal offense, man.

1615
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:22,863
Did you know that?

1616
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:24,529
You trying my phone out?

1617
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,403
- Nah. I didn't...
- What do you mean, no?

1618
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:28,499
Man, what the fuck?
Why you trying my phone out, man?

1619
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:29,542
That's... Hey!

1620
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:30,942
Thanks a lot, man.

1621
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:32,035
I knew you guys were in here.

1622
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,944
Wow. We finally got the money.

1623
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:35,038
Listen. Check. Now.

1624
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,412
- Finally.
- The rent is due.

1625
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:37,416
There it is.

1626
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,453
There are... This
just came from the bank.

1627
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:40,452
There are checks.

1628
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:41,852
- Okay, that's...
- Lots of checks.

1629
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:44,551
No. No. Blank checks
that I am gonna write on

1630
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,957
- with money...
- He's gonna do it.

1631
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:46,993
I'll wait.

1632
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:47,993
Yes. I let him do it.

1633
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:48,994
Sign them to you.

1634
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,394
He's trustworthy.

1635
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,796
You wouldn't trust me
if I were signing the checks,

1636
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,595
so we have the white guy to do it.

1637
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:55,966
All right! Okay!

1638
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:56,969
- Okay!
- Yes.

1639
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:58,061
No, I'll wait right here.

1640
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,071
- No! Don't!
- No. I'll wait...

1641
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:01,142
Just stay right there for a second!

1642
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:06,742
Yo, Dexter. Ramon.

1643
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,907
Hey, Jamal with you?

1644
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,348
Good. Well, guess what, man.

1645
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:12,249
You booked the role.

1646
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:15,380
Yeah. We coming to pick you up
in about 20 minutes, so be ready.

1647
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:16,889
Hey, I heard
Denzel is in this. All right?

1648
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,050
So don't screw it up.

1649
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,559
What's the part?

1650
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:21,754
Do we got hair and makeup?

1651
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,592
Are there sides?

1652
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,098
Is the check cleared?

1653
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,098
Yeah.

1654
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,600
Yup. Hey, you gotta be ready

1655
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,364
in 20 minutes, man.
I'm gonna pick y'all up.

1656
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,995
Are there midgets?

1657
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:32,334
Why do you gotta ask
shit like that, man?

1658
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:33,840
This is the first time
you booked a speaking role,

1659
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:35,273
and that's what you concerned about?

1660
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,072
Do they got Craft Service?

1661
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:38,476
I'll tell you what, ladies.

1662
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,445
I make stars out of everybody.

1663
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,450
I'm so excited!

1664
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,918
Oh, my God!
What if we get a speaking role

1665
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:47,045
in one of his movies?

1666
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:50,556
Oh, my God. Mama's gonna be so proud
of us. I've never been in a limo.

1667
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:52,490
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, y'all ain't...

1668
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:53,754
Y'all ain't never been in a limo?

1669
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:54,988
- No.
- Yeah. That...

1670
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:56,928
You know, I own this company.
This my company.

1671
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:58,659
You know, I normally
don't drive, but I...

1672
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:01,702
I figured I would drive today
because of what was going on.

1673
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,202
- But I got, like, 13 cars.
- Well!

1674
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:04,363
I got a... I got a Hummer.

1675
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:05,633
I got the big Hummer truck.

1676
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,140
I got a... I got a Escalade.

1677
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:09,472
We'd...
We'd love to be in a Hummer!

1678
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,738
Oh, my God!

1679
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:12,336
Oh, yeah. I'd make you hum.

1680
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:14,210
You look like that one girl.

1681
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:15,578
You look like a Colby killer.

1682
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:17,345
- But I know that ain't you.
- A Colby killer?

1683
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:18,885
I don't really think so. But, uh...

1684
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:20,750
Do I get a trailer with hookers in it?

1685
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:25,126
I always look out for you, man.
Be ready in 20 minutes.

1686
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:27,195
Um, who else is gonna come tonight?

1687
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:28,227
Do you know?

1688
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:29,661
I can get y'all a SAG voucher.

1689
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,630
You need a SAG voucher?
I can hook y'all up with that.

1690
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:32,631
SAG voucher?

1691
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:33,894
What's a SAG voucher?

1692
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:34,900
You know...

1693
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:37,665
No, we're here to be stars,
not to be a SAG voucher.

1694
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:38,671
Yeah.

1695
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,105
Oh, you know, we all stars.

1696
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:41,197
- You know, we all are.
- Yeah.

1697
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:42,640
Some people come here to be a star.

1698
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:44,143
Some people end up just being hos.

1699
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:45,838
But that ain't y'all, I know.

1700
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:46,845
You're giving me a headache.

1701
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:49,576
I'm trying to concentrate
and talk to the stars. Okay?

1702
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:52,152
Hey, you know how to get
to Ro... Rodeo?

1703
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:54,085
Oh, you mean Rodeo?

1704
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:55,383
You talking about Rodeo?

1705
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,684
Or Rodeo?

1706
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,020
'Cause Rodeo,

1707
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,616
that's in Beverly Hills.

1708
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:00,786
But Rodeo,

1709
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:02,693
I can take you to Rodeo and Crenshaw.

1710
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,766
Now, you know, they got
that Bill Pickett Rodeo.

1711
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:06,766
You know, the black Dude,
the Bill Pickett Rodeo?

1712
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:08,665
Now, that ain't in town right now.

1713
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:10,795
But I can take ya'll
down there when they come

1714
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:14,239
'cause they do the Universal Soul Circus,
too, with the Bill Pickett.

1715
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:15,775
But that's a whole 'nother Rodeo.

1716
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:18,471
But I'll tell ya what. Y'all want to go
to Rodeo and Crenshaw?

1717
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,980
Okay, I got you. Rodeo...
Rodeo and Crenshaw.

1718
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:23,683
All right, man.
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

1719
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:24,752
Bye.

1720
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,217
Rodeo. Go figure that shit. Fuck that.

1721
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,058
He's on his way.

1722
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:37,961
He's just picking up our wardrobe, baby.

1723
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:38,964
Yeah, baby!

1724
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:39,965
Yeah...

1725
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:43,059
Movie star!

1726
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:44,536
Move us to Hollywood! Here we come.

1727
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:45,731
Hollywood. Hollywood, baby.

1728
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:46,830
That's right, I'm ready.

1729
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:48,000
- You ready for that?
- I'm ready.

1730
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:49,337
I was born ready.

1731
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:51,639
Hollywood Walk of Fame.

1732
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:53,509
I'll tell you, it's over, man.

1733
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:54,980
Yeah, I'm not gonna be
playing Superman again.

1734
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,074
Wesley, Denzel,
all of 'em... they done!

1735
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:59,916
Where's my talent?

1736
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:01,511
I needed 20 on my talent.

1737
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:03,056
Are you sure
you want to use those bozos?

1738
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,353
I mean, they never
even had a speaking part before.

1739
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:22,541
Jamal!

1740
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:23,542
What?

1741
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,442
What did you do with my hair gel?

1742
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,140
I don't know, motherfucker.

1743
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:31,451
Look in the cabinet, man.

1744
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,586
Oh. Right. Yeah.

1745
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:38,548
Yeah!

1746
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,064
Are you choking?

1747
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:47,725
No, man! I'm beatboxing!

1748
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:49,463
Oh, 'cause I can do
the Heimlich maneuver.

1749
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:54,741
I know I told you. We only have
ten days to make this movie.

1750
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:57,334
We only had a camera for ten days.

1751
01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:00,414
I need this shot.
Please, Dee. Please, Jasmine.

1752
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:01,777
You guys are my producers.

1753
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:02,941
I need this shot.

1754
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:04,075
All right. All right. I'm on it.

1755
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:05,345
All right? I'm on it.

1756
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:10,448
Yo, man. We got trouble, dude.

1757
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:11,820
Yeah. I know.

1758
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:14,020
<i>Everybody Hates Chris</i>
meets <i>Desperate Housewives.</i>

1759
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:16,222
It's called Inglewood.

1760
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:19,357
No, man. Mrs. Bundy's
trying to get in here!

1761
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:22,058
Oh, man.

1762
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,005
- What?
- Our agent's here

1763
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:29,201
with two fine breezies and a limo!

1764
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,838
And Mrs. Bundy? And a I... Oh.

1765
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,041
Damn, it's like trouble
but not trouble, but...

1766
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:36,583
Is Mrs. Bundy wearing a bra today?

1767
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:38,084
'Cause I like it
when she doesn't wear a bra.

1768
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:39,414
She's got a little nipple, man.

1769
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:44,184
Look, someone, call their agent,
for Christ's sakes.

1770
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:45,520
Jasmine, call the agent.

1771
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,598
Yeah, we flying in.
We're about five minutes away.

1772
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:51,757
You got the check?

1773
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,860
All right. Good.

1774
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,165
All right, you guys are gonna be
working with Spike Leroy.

1775
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:58,705
- He's got a five picture...
- Spike Leroy!

1776
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,434
He's got
a five-picture deal on the table.

1777
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:01,873
Don't fuck it up.

1778
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,377
Man, we ain't gonna fuck...
I mean, a five-picture deal.

1779
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,380
Maybe we'll fuck up two movies
'cause every actor gets a couple failures,

1780
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:08,710
but other than that, we in.

1781
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,341
- What we need is two good ones.
- Don't fuck it up.

1782
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:11,976
I won't... That is awesome.

1783
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:13,145
He gonna fuck it up, not me.

1784
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:14,152
I was born to do this.

1785
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:15,153
- What?
- Born.

1786
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:16,314
Where's the food?

1787
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:17,982
Craft Services. Right.

1788
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:19,720
The food?

1789
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,160
I said soul food, not tofu!

1790
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:23,855
The company's doing
what it was meant to do.

1791
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:26,900
I want to sign with you right now.

1792
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,264
Me, too.

1793
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:33,005
So, uh, um...
when do we get our check?

1794
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:34,598
Look, man... I saw that mob

1795
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:36,142
outside your penthouse.
Don't worry about it.

1796
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:37,905
I've got you.
Right now, it's about you two.

1797
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,742
It's not about me.
It's not about him.

1798
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,543
It's not about you ladies yet.

1799
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:42,980
But it's about you guys. All right?

1800
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:43,982
All right.

1801
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:45,575
- Yeah!
- Yeah, mother!

1802
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,917
Um, check it out.
We would like a five-page article

1803
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:50,651
in <i>Hollywood Reporter</i> on the 32nd.

1804
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:51,657
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1805
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,920
Done.

1806
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:53,960
Yeah!

1807
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:55,757
It's not in the budget!

1808
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:56,922
The budget?

1809
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,897
Look. We don't have any more money.

1810
01:23:59,000 --> 01:23:59,967
All right, Spike Leroy?

1811
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:02,468
This is it. You have
no more shots! That's it!

1812
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:03,867
Jasmine.

1813
01:24:03,972 --> 01:24:05,872
Does Spielberg care about a budget?

1814
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:07,464
No.

1815
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:10,635
Dee. Does John Singleton
care about a budget?

1816
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:12,303
Uh, yeah.

1817
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,211
You know what? You might be right.

1818
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:16,442
But anyway, this is the scene
of the millennium, you guys!

1819
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:18,451
I gotta get this shot, you guys!

1820
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,851
Please! You guys
are my producers!

1821
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:22,149
If we don't get this shot,

1822
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:23,884
we don't make our total run time.

1823
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:26,256
The distributor's gonna
be very upset at us.

1824
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:28,261
Look, I know we have
four more films to shoot,

1825
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:30,888
but we need to get this shot
to complete this film.

1826
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:32,591
We got four more films to do.

1827
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,725
I promise we won't
go over budget on the next film.

1828
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:35,803
- Now, I promise.
- Hey, yo, look.

1829
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:37,862
Yo! Our talent's here!

1830
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:39,872
Hey, get 'em
in hair and makeup right now.

1831
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:41,373
Right now. Hey. Look...

1832
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:42,374
- Nico.
...going down...

1833
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:44,741
Couple of fools just got here.

1834
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:45,813
- I can't believe they're here.
- Sir.

1835
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,609
I'm just waiting for two more extras.

1836
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:48,909
Oh, they just walked up.

1837
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:50,644
Our stars are here.

1838
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:51,946
"Stars."
You need to complete today.

1839
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:53,850
All right?
You need to complete today.

1840
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:55,217
Now I can complete my scene.

1841
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:56,221
I got my two stars.

1842
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:57,450
- Yes!
- Let's get 'em

1843
01:24:57,559 --> 01:24:58,548
- in hair and makeup.
- All right!

1844
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,854
Let's get it going.

1845
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:01,019
Back on the set ASAP.

1846
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:02,426
Right. Right. What about our check?

1847
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:03,519
Yeah. We gotta get paid.

1848
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:04,859
- Gotta get paid.
- Check with your agent.

1849
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:06,456
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Check with our agent?

1850
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:08,559
What are you... Come on, man, I'm a star.
Don't push me, man.

1851
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:11,670
Oh, look at this.

1852
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:12,671
Hair and makeup.

1853
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,469
Yeah!

1854
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:15,804
How you feeling, Jamal?
You feeling good?

1855
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:17,104
I'm good. How are you? You?

1856
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,840
I'm good. Good. I'll be doing a lot
better when we get our damn checks.

1857
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,142
That's what I'm talking about.

1858
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:23,683
Look at the chairs.
More like those directors, man.

1859
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,252
- Action!
- I said cut!

1860
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:26,445
Yeah!

1861
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:29,148
Hey! Get off the set now!

1862
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:30,246
I can't work with this.

1863
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:31,256
I like that one.

1864
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:32,758
I like it! Yeah!

1865
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:36,289
- Okay!
- You doing good? You feeling good?

1866
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:37,364
- I'm feeling good, man.
- Good.

1867
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:38,363
What about you?

1868
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:40,366
You gonna, you know...

1869
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:41,366
Like this.

1870
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:42,936
Bring me my smoothie.

1871
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:47,274
I said latte, damn it!

1872
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:48,364
Damn it!

1873
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:49,568
- How's that, huh?
- I like it.

1874
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:50,905
- You see the lean? The lean?
- Yeah, yeah.

1875
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:51,910
That lean like that?

1876
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:53,776
That's good.

1877
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:56,316
Look at this right here.

1878
01:25:56,417 --> 01:25:58,885
"Not liable for bodily injury
when performing stunts."

1879
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:02,448
Wait a minute.
No, I ain't performing no damn stunts.

1880
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,047
No. I don't know how to do that.

1881
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,683
- I ain't performing shit.
- Oh, shit, no!

1882
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:06,760
I'm not doing that shit.

1883
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:07,987
They have people to do that.

1884
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:08,994
All right, man... No, no.

1885
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:10,155
No. This... We need... No.

1886
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:12,460
- I'm not signing this.
- Yeah. I'm... I'm not, either.

1887
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:13,465
No. I'm not signing it.

1888
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:14,500
- I'm not signing it.
- No.

1889
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:15,899
- We made a...
- Ramon.

1890
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,301
- We gotta talk to him.
- Talk to Ramon.

1891
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:18,702
- Let's get him.
- Oh, man...

1892
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:22,971
- Yo, Ramon, man, what is this?
- What's up?

1893
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:25,136
"Bodily injury"? "Own stunts"?

1894
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:26,679
I ain't doing my own stunts, man.

1895
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:28,942
You guys, you gotta pay your dues
when you start off, man.

1896
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:30,415
This is your first speaking part.

1897
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:32,884
You got any idea what I had to do
to pull these strings, man?

1898
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:34,215
Well, I'm... I'm not signing it.

1899
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:35,755
Yeah. I... I'm not signing either, man.

1900
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:37,620
This... I'm not gonna hurt myself.

1901
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:39,158
I guess I can give these checks back.

1902
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:45,022
I mean to say I'm not signing it
unless I'm smiling when I'm signing it.

1903
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:47,363
You know, um...
'Cause that's a lot of zeroes.

1904
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:49,527
I'd do car explosions.

1905
01:26:49,637 --> 01:26:51,002
- I'll set myself on fire.
- Yeah.

1906
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:52,766
Look. See, 'cause I've been
practicing my signature.

1907
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,705
- Here you go.
- Okay. Call me Blackie Chan.

1908
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:56,401
I'll do all of mine.
You know what I'm saying?

1909
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:59,036
Hey, I'm signing in Spanish, too.
<i>Sí.</i>

1910
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:00,614
Here you go.

1911
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,615
You know what I'm saying?

1912
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:04,582
Oh, man! I was...

1913
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:06,483
We was just trying to keep you
on your toes, man.

1914
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:07,646
- I know, man.
- You know what I mean?

1915
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:09,052
You know, we just wanted to see...

1916
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:10,488
test you out.
You know? That's all I was doing?

1917
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,082
Right? I wasn't really complaining.

1918
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:14,423
I was just expressing my... my passion

1919
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:15,757
- for the... for the... for the contact.
- Right. Right.

1920
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:17,194
You know what we were doing? Acting.

1921
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:18,663
- We were acting.
- There you go.

1922
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:19,858
We were acting like we were pissed off

1923
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:20,900
- about the stunts.
- All right.

1924
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:22,401
- Okay.
- Is there a Check 'n Go

1925
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:23,470
- anywhere close by?
- Yeah.

1926
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:24,936
I want to cash this right away.

1927
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:26,131
Um... couple of blocks down there.

1928
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:28,334
And I hope you ain't acting
like this is not gonna bounce.

1929
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:29,410
Naw, it ain't gonna bounce. It's good.

1930
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:30,499
- All right, gentlemen.
- Just checking.

1931
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:31,510
- All right.
- All right.

1932
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,974
All right, look, this is what's going on.

1933
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,552
We gonna capture a wide shot,

1934
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:40,484
and we're gonna move in for a two shot.

1935
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,647
Then we want to get a close-up,
and that should be it.

1936
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:44,281
And we'll do a couple different angles,

1937
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:45,984
you know, get the coverage,

1938
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:47,618
and that should be a wrap.
You got it?

1939
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:49,321
- Got it.
- All right, great.

1940
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:51,489
All right, Spike,
we gotta go, we gotta go.

1941
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,227
All right, here we go, here we go.

1942
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:57,670
Yo, yo, yo. Don't move.

1943
01:27:57,772 --> 01:27:59,330
The cops are getting outta the car
right now.

1944
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,668
Man, what did I tell you, man?

1945
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:02,834
- Don't go turning and shit, man.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1946
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:04,878
When a black man
says "Don't move," you don't move.

1947
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:05,877
- Okay.
- That's real.

1948
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,641
I'm vibrating.

1949
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:11,585
Let's see if these guys'
plates are clean.

1950
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:13,587
Yeah.

1951
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:17,951
- It's Ramon, our agent, baby.
- Yeah!

1952
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:19,185
What's up, Ramon?

1953
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:20,955
My man, <i>¿qué pasó?</i>

1954
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:24,862
Yeah, man. Now, this star stuff
is easy, baby. It's a cakewalk.

1955
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:25,898
- Yeah, easy, man.
- Yeah.

1956
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,127
Yo, Dee, I know I been taking
a lot of takes, man,

1957
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:30,636
but do you think I can shoot out
the rest of the film?

1958
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:31,762
No.

1959
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:33,067
I'm selling 'em back to the vendor.

1960
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:34,266
Sorry, Spike.

1961
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:36,206
All right, all right, all right.

1962
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,211
Yeah. I'm with Spike Leroy right now.

1963
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,372
His next film is
<i>Single Black Female.</i>

1964
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:42,108
I'm gonna try to hook
you boys up on this.

1965
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:44,049
You bet. All right.

1966
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,313
It's what I do, baby.

1967
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:47,888
All right. Yeah.

1968
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:49,183
And...

1969
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:50,222
action!

1970
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:51,622
The plates check out.

1971
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:52,784
Everything looks good.

1972
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:53,861
It's clean.

1973
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:56,887
They don't look legit to me.

1974
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,556
Let's go check 'em out.

1975
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:01,658
All right. Maybe we can, uh,
confiscate some bootleg mix CDs.

1976
01:29:01,769 --> 01:29:02,701
Yeah.

1977
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:05,637
Yeah. Actually, Jamal and I
really wanted to say thank you for this.

1978
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,072
You know, you are the best agent
in Hollywood.

1979
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,110
- <i>¡Gracias, numero uno!</i>
- Nice!

1980
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:11,439
<i>¡Sí!</i>

1981
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:12,843
Oh, hey. You know what?

1982
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:14,608
You know what?
We gotta go. We gotta get busy

1983
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:16,513
- being stoned!
- You said it!

1984
01:29:16,617 --> 01:29:17,811
Yeah, baby!

1985
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:19,511
Step out of the vehicle.

1986
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:23,949
Look, it's the booby patrol!

1987
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:25,787
We got a wise guy here.

1988
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:27,793
Come on, let's move.
Let's move. Let's go.

1989
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:28,953
All right. All right.

1990
01:29:29,063 --> 01:29:30,155
Here we go. What's your na...

1991
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:33,992
Yo, man, come on.
I'm gonna give you a autograph, man.

1992
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:35,694
- You just have to ask.
- I don't need your autograph.

1993
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:37,270
Damn, dawg!

1994
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,306
Aw, man, relax!

1995
01:29:39,407 --> 01:29:41,170
Great job! Cut. Cut.

1996
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:42,799
Great job. Great job, gentlemen.

1997
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:45,174
Great job. You guys are
on the way to making stars.

1998
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:46,610
All right, let's do it one more time.

1999
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:48,511
One more for safety.

2000
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:51,107
I know I said that last time,
but one more for safety.

2001
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,481
You've got a heck of a grip.

2002
01:29:52,587 --> 01:29:53,918
Great job. Great job. One more.

2003
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:56,387
One more take. One more take, Dee.
One more take.

2004
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:57,651
And...

2005
01:29:57,759 --> 01:29:59,454
action!

2006
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,754
Come on, let's go! Let's move.

2007
01:30:00,862 --> 01:30:02,420
Okay, hold on, hold on.
Now I'm a superstar.

2008
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:03,758
- I take my time.
- Booby patrol.

2009
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:06,698
Oh, we got a wise guy.
Get the hell out the car right now.

2010
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:08,166
Okay. We're superstars. Just...

2011
01:30:08,269 --> 01:30:09,236
Hey. Wait.

2012
01:30:10,972 --> 01:30:12,064
Jesus, man.

2013
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:13,834
Like I say, if you want
an autograph...

2014
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:14,965
Broken death grip.

2015
01:30:16,711 --> 01:30:18,303
I think I cracked my ass.

2016
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:20,813
Uh, you know what?
That was great, but you know what?

2017
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:22,780
There's something missing.

2018
01:30:22,884 --> 01:30:25,375
You know what?
Give me these rubber batons.

2019
01:30:25,486 --> 01:30:27,351
We... You know what?
I'm gonna go get the real ones.

2020
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:29,650
I need this shit to feel real.
You feel me?

2021
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:31,384
It needs to feel real.
I'll be right back.

2022
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:32,982
No, no. That's okay!

2023
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,652
Spike Leroy, we like...

2024
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:35,888
- What are...
- Leroy!

2025
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:38,563
What are you doing?

2026
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:40,791
- He went to get the...
- Real ones.

2027
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,503
We need to make
this scene feel real, you guys.

2028
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:45,867
This is the hero shot.

2029
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:47,235
- All right?
- It's Method acting.

2030
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:48,433
It's Method.

2031
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:50,067
Method.
We're gonna take it from the top.

2032
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:52,203
Take it from the top.
I know we did take 15,

2033
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:54,747
but one more take. This is...
We gotta make it feel real.

2034
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:55,975
- All right.
- These are real.

2035
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:57,050
These are real?

2036
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:58,413
Oh, man.

2037
01:30:58,519 --> 01:30:59,508
- Let's do it. Let's do it.
- Okay.

2038
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:00,712
All right? Let's go.

2039
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:02,346
Cool, man.
From the top. From the top.

2040
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,015
All right.

2041
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,353
Make it feel real.

2042
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,586
I got grass on me.

2043
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:08,989
All right. Real. Real!

2044
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:10,154
- Real. Real.
- Let's do it.

2045
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:11,424
Be, like, Method acting.

2046
01:31:11,532 --> 01:31:12,692
Method, baby. All right.

2047
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,960
It's gonna be really real.

2048
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:15,092
Realer than real.

2049
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:16,101
No, super real.

2050
01:31:16,204 --> 01:31:17,102
Here we go. Here we go.

2051
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:18,297
Yeah. Yeah. All right.

2052
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:20,374
- And... you guys are stars now!
- Ready.

2053
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,466
- Okay! Yeah!
- We're stars! We're superstars!

2054
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:23,566
- All right, shoot.
- Action!

2055
01:31:23,678 --> 01:31:25,270
- All right.
- Come on, let's go.

2056
01:31:25,379 --> 01:31:26,277
Step out of the vehicle.

2057
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:27,847
The booby patrol!

2058
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:29,849
Oh, we got a wise guy.
Get the hell out the car.

2059
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:31,282
Okay. All right. I'm outta the car.

2060
01:31:31,385 --> 01:31:32,283
Okay. All right.

2061
01:31:34,856 --> 01:31:36,323
- That hurts!
- Wait, hey, come on, man.

2062
01:31:36,424 --> 01:31:37,914
Watch the muscle.
I just finished working out.

2063
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:39,390
- Go!
- Ow, man!

2064
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,428
- What is this?
- What's going on?

2065
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:45,192
Just calm down, cops! We... We'll
give you an autograph if you want, right?

2066
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:46,459
- No.
- You have a pen?

2067
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:48,896
Come on now.

2068
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,436
All right, cut. Cut.

2069
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:51,869
- How's that?
- Now we'll get into...

2070
01:31:51,973 --> 01:31:53,838
- The beating?
...the actual beat-down.

2071
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:55,772
- Okay, clear...
- This is the beat-down.

2072
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:57,401
This is...
I studied this. I studied this.

2073
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,742
Yeah, don't... Don't hit so hard.
Don't hit 'em so hard.

2074
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:02,315
I know these are real...
real billy clubs,

2075
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:05,044
but, uh, you know,
we need this scene to feel real.

2076
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:07,347
Okay, great. You got some padding
for us so we, you know...

2077
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:09,082
- You got padding?
- No budget for padding.

2078
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,522
No budget for padding, huh?
All right, here we go.

2079
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:12,752
And...

2080
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:13,827
action!

2081
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:17,762
Oh, that...

2082
01:32:25,973 --> 01:32:28,498
Mr. Policeman...

2083
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:31,771
Mister... Ohh! Police...

2084
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:36,346
Stop it!

2085
01:32:43,157 --> 01:32:44,624
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

2086
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:46,022
All right. That was good.

2087
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:47,788
Got it.

2088
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:48,793
Reaction?

2089
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:51,091
Great job, great job.

2090
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:52,790
It is so real, you guys.

2091
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:55,232
That's awesome.
So awesome. Great job, D.

2092
01:32:55,336 --> 01:32:57,531
- Great job.
- I can't feel my legs!

2093
01:32:57,638 --> 01:32:59,503
Now we need the reaction.

2094
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:00,938
The reaction shots.

2095
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:02,566
- What?
- What? Reaction?

2096
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:03,644
Look, man!

2097
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:06,042
That's great.

2098
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:07,842
We gonna sell
this movie, you guys.

2099
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:09,211
Sell this movie!

2100
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:13,014
Just one more for safety,
and then that's a wrap. All right?

2101
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,144
All right, here we go.

2102
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:15,654
And...

2103
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:16,745
action, you guys.

2104
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:18,818
God!

2105
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:24,322
How you feeling, man?

2106
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:25,831
Oh, I'm... I feel good.

2107
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:28,060
- We're stars, baby.
- Stars!

2108
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:29,158
Stars.

2109
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:32,670
We're...

2110
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,297
- We're celebrities.
- Yeah.

2111
01:33:35,643 --> 01:33:37,110
We're celebrities. We did it.

2112
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:40,808
Superstars!

2113
01:33:40,915 --> 01:33:42,348
And cut!

2114
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:44,850
That's great, you guys.
Now let's take 15.

2115
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:46,419
You guys are stars now!

2116
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,147
Yeah! All right.

2117
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:49,813
- Awesome!
- Thank you, thank you.

2118
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:50,822
Yeah.

2119
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:52,859
All right, don't call us.
We'll call you.

2120
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:53,790
- Okay.
- All right.

2121
01:33:53,894 --> 01:33:55,759
What does this mean?

2122
01:33:55,863 --> 01:33:57,922
Is this what stars go through?

2123
01:33:58,032 --> 01:33:59,659
Yeah. Is that what it is?

2124
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:04,236
I'm just gonna lay down
for a while on the concrete.

2125
01:34:04,338 --> 01:34:05,305
Oh, I'm sleepy.

2126
01:34:11,012 --> 01:34:13,139
Y-Yes! We did it!

2127
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:15,078
- We made it!
- Finally!

2128
01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:17,172
Look out, Denz.

2129
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:20,587
Look out, Denzel,
your mama's coming.

2130
01:34:20,688 --> 01:34:21,882
Yeah.

2131
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:22,887
Awesome!

2132
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:23,888
Yes!

2133
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:25,390
Hey, Jamal?

2134
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:26,391
Do you... What's up, man?

2135
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,587
Do you have your
half of this month's rent?

2136
01:34:28,696 --> 01:34:29,890
Hell, no.

2137
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:31,328
- Yeah, me, either.
- Crazy.

2138
01:34:31,432 --> 01:34:34,060
Oh, I don't think
we're ever gonna get the rent.

2139
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,304
Cut.

2140
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,007
Great job,
you guys.
