[doctor]
<i>What do you remember?</i>

2
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:24,024
[man]
<i>I don't.</i>

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,295
[doctor] <i>Concentrate,
It'll help jog your memory.</i>

4
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,501
[man]
<i>I was taking samples.</i>

5
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:35,970
[doctor]
<i>That's correct.</i>

6
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:37,772
<i>You still have some amnesia,</i>

7
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:39,306
<i>but you're doing better.</i>

8
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,277
[man]
<i>What happened to me?</i>

9
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:50,284
[doctor] <i>Mr. Massey, a few days
ago you had an accident at work.</i>

10
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,352
You almost drowned.

11
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:55,474
You were in shock when they
brought you into the emergency room.

12
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:59,359
And because of the near
drowning, you had hypoxia.

13
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:02,664
That's a low level of oxygen
in the blood.

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,733
This has caused some injury
to your brain

15
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,135
<i>and other organ systems.</i>

16
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,605
[Massey]
<i>I fell in.</i>

17
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:14,809
[doctor] <i>That's
correct. You fell in and...</i>

18
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:18,078
<i>you were alone.</i>

19
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,815
[ominous music]

20
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,870
[man] <i>I need to make
sure I can trust you with this.</i>

21
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:45,339
When you've done the job,

22
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,408
go to the drop-off point
and meet me be back here.

23
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,513
This is your second chance.

24
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:56,783
Give it to me.

25
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,592
This plane lands at 2:00 a.m.

26
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,295
He always parks
in parking lot number six,

27
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:12,232
no security cameras,
very few people park there.

28
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:13,868
He'll be alone.

29
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:16,671
Make sure you are, too.

30
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,644
<i>My name is Michael Massey</i>

31
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:25,880

the biggest mistake of my life.</i>

00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,148
<i>Again.</i>

33
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:38,726
<i>This one I saw coming.</i>

34
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:42,730
<i>The first one
crept up behind me.</i>

35
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,400
<i>I had my back turned.</i>

00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,481
[ominous music]

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,562
[Michael]
Hey, guys, wait up.

38
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:18,398
Sorry, I had to put
my gloves on.

39
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,279
Michael, put that barrel
over by the storage area.

40
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,614
Okay.

41
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,353
[suspenseful music continues]

42
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,866
[Michael]
Floyd, I'm ready.

43
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:10,918
I had fun, I was tired though.

44
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:12,220
My hand was killing me.

45
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,755
I just needed one strike,

46
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:16,323
one strike
and I would've won the game.

47
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,604
You ever bowled a perfect game?

48
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:34,542
[man] Never have. Must be
hard. My best score is 150.

49
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:40,413
[Michael] <i>Right now, all I
see is what lies straight ahead.</i>

50
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:44,685
<i>I need to turn and around,
I need to face the world.</i>

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,157
<i>I know what's there, family.</i>

52
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,792
That was a sure thing.

53
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:51,959
<i>Friends.</i>

54
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:55,930
<i>They're waiting for me
to turn around and face them.</i>

55
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,032
<i>But before I do that...</i>

56
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,166
Yeah, that.

57
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:04,138
<i>...I have to squeeze
this trigger one more time.</i>

58
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:07,307

[crickets chirping]

60
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:44,865
Nice work, <i>ese.</i>

61
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,601
Cleanest one so far.

62
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,771
I like a man who makes
my job easier.

63
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,141
It's just this one time,
open the gate.

64
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,478
I heard that one before,
but you?

65
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,581
You're different.

66
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,818
No bullet hole, no broken glass.

67
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,788
You got your corpses in trunk,
out of view.

68
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:12,026
You drive in a common vehicle
for these parts, homie.

69
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:15,229
I worked with guys
like you before.

70
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,098
I know why you're here.

71
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:20,601
You got something to prove.

72
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,403
Open the gate now.

73
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:23,838
Or what, <i>ese?</i>

74
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:26,874
You take out your piece,
blast me?

75
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,012
You got your piece...

76
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,947
but this here...

77
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:34,849
...this is my piece.

78
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,650
And an <i>hombre</i> like you,

79
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,919
clean, professional.

80
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:41,756
You're not going to let
all this good work go to waste.

81
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:43,791
You want to get paid?

82
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,195
Get your hands dirty, <i>ese.</i>

[Michael]
Hey there, you need some help?

87
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,889
I saw you carrying all this luggage
there. I figured you might need a hand.

88
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,262
No, no, no, put this one down,
push that one back.

89
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,998
We'll put that one at last.

90
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:11,105
That's good,
now push it all the way back.

91
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,377
Keep pushing, keep pushing.
Put it right back there.

92
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,033
[sighs] Sorry, I'm late.

[exhaling]

94
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,743
Don't look at me like that.

95
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:26,380
You could have cleaned
your gun after the meeting.

96
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:29,483
You wanted this job done right?

97
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:30,851
I did that.

98
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:33,921
No doubt.

99
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,958
This is
a different battlefield now.

100
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:43,931
- [sighs]
- How do you feel?

101
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:47,167
I feel, I feel dirty.

102
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,038
Oh, that's right.
You do work at the...

103
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,443
How do you know that?

104
00:12:57,712 --> 00:13:00,582
[chuckling]

105
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:03,384
Relax, I did some digging.

106
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,254
I always like to get to know
the people that I work with.

107
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,159
Look, it gets easier.

108
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:16,964
The first one is always the most
difficult but the next one, after that.

109
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,408
There's not going
to be a next one.

110
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:19,432
This was it.

111
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,901
Don't be so sure.

112
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:23,937
[sighs]

113
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:31,478
Anyways, you got
something for me.

114
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:44,091
[Michael] The junk yard
cretin took care of everything.

115
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:46,593
[man]
Good.

116
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:50,831
Rodrigo's a scumbag,
but I put him to a good use.

117
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,966
He gets things done.

118
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:01,442
Well, this is cause
for a celebration.

119
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,580
- [scoffs] I prefer cash.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

120
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:07,848
Watch, look at this.

121
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,652
We busted this guy last week.

122
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:14,188
He was acting strange,
so I pulled him aside.

123
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:15,856
You know what I found?

124
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,460
300 candy bars
just like this one,

125
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,862
stashed in a suitcase.

126
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:25,032
These guys get so creative.

127
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,202
It's quite a show.

128
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:34,108
As a customs agent,
I have front-row seats.

129
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,876
That's nice, gimme my money.

130
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,244
All right?

131
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,753
[sighs]

132
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,153
Look...

133
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:50,257
...I know how you feel.

134
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:55,095
Okay, you went to war,
it wasn't what you thought.

135
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,732
You never got to look...

136
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:03,337
...a bad guy in the eyes and
just fucking pull the trigger.

137
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,941
Tonight I gave you that chance.

138
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,577
You got to be a warrior.

139
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,515
Imbeciles like the candy man,
I just turn over to authorities.

140
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:15,249
The guy
you took care of tonight,

141
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:18,620
he wasn't a peon,
he was a major player.

142
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,390
You did the world a favor,
and so did I.

143
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,595
[Michael]
I'm not going to tell you again.

144
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:29,263
Give me the money, now.

145
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,276
Doesn't have to end like this.

146
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,980
You know we could be
a great team.

147
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,417
[exhales]

148
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:53,922
Listen,
this concludes our business.

149
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,724
Don't ever contact me again.

150
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:58,125
Oh, I won't.

151
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,401
Might be somebody else
who will though.

152
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,378
I thought this was
a one-man operation.

153
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:23,952
[man] It's this one
guy, might be a cop.

154
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:26,621
Someone from my work,
I don't know.

155
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:30,224
I've seen him follow me
a few times.

156
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,760
You need to take care of this.

157
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,663
This affects both of us.

158
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:37,498
I'm giving you another job.

159
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:44,004
This time...

160
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:46,139
...I'll pay double.

161
00:16:56,283 --> 00:17:00,555

[engine starts]

163
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,821
[bubble wrap rustling]

164
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,836
Where have you been?

165
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:35,976
What is that?

166
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:37,912
[Michael]
Our second chance.

167
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,615
A friend came through
with a loan.

168
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,020
Well, whatever it is,
it isn't enough.

169
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:48,690
- [Michael] How do you know that?
- Because the money we need

170
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:51,191
doesn't fit inside an envelope.

171
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,461
Look, it's enough okay?

172
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:57,808
In the meantime, I want you
to stop packing all these boxes,

173
00:19:57,832 --> 00:19:59,801
get rid
of this bubble wrap and...

174
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:02,202
And what?

175
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,840
- [Michael] Give me a hug.
- [laughing]

176
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:13,548
[woman] Well, something up
here is going to get squeezed.

177
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:17,417
[Michael] Don't pop the
bubbles, that is so annoying.

178
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:19,386
[woman] You told
me to get rid of all of it

179
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,431
[Michael] With all this
bubble wrap, it'll take all night.

180
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:23,825
Now stop, Emily, stop.

181
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,529
Look, they're not taking
this house, okay?

182
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:32,767
If they do, they're gonna have to drag
us out of here kicking and screaming.

183
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:34,869
[chuckles]

184
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,841
Well...

185
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,410
that's going to happen
to one of us anyway.

186
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:58,258
But he's going to have
to wait another four months.

187
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,542
[Emily]
Your hands are cold.

188
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:30,758
[water running]

189
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,385
It's just one more job.

190
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:35,923
[ominous music]

191
00:22:44,265 --> 00:22:46,499
[crickets chirping]

192
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:49,462
Don't look at me like that.

193
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,438
He offered you another job.

194
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:02,710
I told you this was a bad idea.

195
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:04,745
You knew he'd give you
another one.

196
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:05,956
You must have
something inside you

197
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,815
that wants to prove something.

198
00:24:08,616 --> 00:24:10,384
You should have
never gotten involved.

199
00:24:11,152 --> 00:24:13,654
- We're both involved.
- No, not me.

200
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:16,958
You can find another private
investigator. I am done taking pictures.

201
00:24:19,694 --> 00:24:21,696
I wish I could say
the same for him.

202
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
Open it.

203
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,375
You were the one
supposed to take the pictures.

204
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:38,212
I hired you to follow him,
not the other way around.

205
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,314
Look, I did this as a favor.

206
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,083
You came to me, remember?

207
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:47,054
He offered me double.

208
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,856
[man]
I'll stop following him.

209
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:50,524
It's too late.

210
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:51,826
He wants you dead.

211
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:54,362
And he knows where I work.

212
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:57,932
It's only a matter of time before he
figures out we're working together.

213
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:01,268
What if he already knows?

214
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:06,974
Then I'll have to squeeze
that trigger one more time.

215
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:09,944
[man]
Okay, before you do that,

216
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:11,545
some things
you might want to know.

217
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,948
His name is Douglas Gofft.

218
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:17,485
Former military, now a customs
inspector at the airport.

219
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:20,688
He must have gotten some intel
about drug shipments overseas.

220
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,724
He uses his position
to let smugglers sneak through

221
00:25:23,858 --> 00:25:26,927
and then he steals their stash
and sells it for himself.

222
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:31,165
Runs a pretty
efficient operation.

223
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:33,868
All under the radar.

224
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:37,538
I got to get to my store unit,
I need to get my piece.

225
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:39,740
You can't do that.

226
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,610
You know what happens
if you do that?

227
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,745
I don't have a choice.

228
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:20,147
[Floyd]
I'm busy, what do you need?

229
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:22,083
You seen James around?

230
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,918
[Floyd]
He left early.

231
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:26,353
- He left early?
- Yep.

232
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:27,767
He did the same thing yesterday.

233
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:29,924
He left right after you did.

234
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:45,773
[ominous music]

235
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:25,880
Hey, Michael,
come here for a sec.

236
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:28,792
Hey, I need you
to take some samples for me.

237
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:31,785
The crew's late today and I'm
getting ready to head out.

238
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,124
Arms up.

239
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:45,432
[exhales]

240
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:55,776
Something wrong?

241
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:07,188
[sighs]

242
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,272
[Emily]
You violated your probation.

243
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:29,210
- [sighs in frustration] Are you opening my mail now?
- [Emily] This is serious.

244
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:32,413
What were you doing
in a high school parking lot?

245
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,685
How is this going to benefit me
and our unborn child

246
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,819
if you're sitting
in a jail cell?

247
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:41,021
I was meeting with a friend.

248
00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:43,224
He's the one
who gave me the money.

249
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:46,093
Well, next time
you meet this friend,

250
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:48,362
do it in public during the day.

251
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:53,734
There won't be a next time.

252
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:08,516
What are you looking at?

253
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:11,928
I was just waiting to see
if that guy out there

254
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:13,921
was going to come look
at the house.

255
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,559
Anyways, I talked to my brother.

256
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:21,195
He said he could get an attorney
that could work with us for free.

257
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:51,325
[ominous music]

258
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:11,912
[tires screeching]

259
00:30:20,622 --> 00:30:22,557
[Michael]
<i>When a man becomes distracted,</i>

260
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:24,825
<i>he makes mistakes.</i>

261
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,495
<i>He makes bad choices.</i>

262
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:31,932
<i>He gets sloppy.</i>

263
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:37,037
<i>Yesterday,
that man paid me a visit.</i>

264
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,107
<i>But who was it?</i>

265
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:43,377
<i>Douglas or James?</i>

266
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,051
Hey, James.

267
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:52,853
You got a minute.

268
00:30:53,454 --> 00:30:55,255
[James] I'm busy right
now. What do you need?

269
00:30:55,824 --> 00:30:58,325
[Michael] You drive
a black car, don't you?

270
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:00,894
[James]
<i>Michael, you've seen my car.</i>

271
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:02,463
<i>Now, what's this about?</i>

272
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:04,965
[Michael]
I had a visitor yesterday,

273
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,634
a guy in a black car.

274
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:09,637
When I came outside,
he took off.

275
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:11,939
[James]
<i>And you think it was me?</i>

276
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:13,273
[Michael]
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

277
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,342
<i>Douglas drives a black car, too.</i>

278
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,712
[James]
<i>Then it was Douglas.</i>

279
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,347
[Michael] <i>Let's hope he
doesn't come back then.</i>

280
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:24,318
'Cause if anyone comes near
my house and hurt my family,

281
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:26,721
they're going
to be sorry they did.

282
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:29,957
You're not allowed to have
a gun in your house, Michael.

283
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:33,260
<i>I would be careful about
violating that court order.</i>

284
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,620
[Emily]
<i>Joey, come here.</i>

285
00:31:59,888 --> 00:32:02,356
You know what
I think would be a good idea?

286
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,793
<i>Go get your crayons.</i>

287
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:07,729
<i>Get a sheet of paper
and draw daddy a picture.</i>

288
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:09,997
<i>I think he'll like that.</i>

290
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:35,355
Mommy, look what I drew
for daddy.

291
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:48,435
[Floyd]
Michael.

292
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:03,984
I'm headed out.
I need you to take some samples.

293
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:05,586
Okay.

294
00:33:09,524 --> 00:33:11,492
James is here if you need help.

295
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:18,165
Everything all right
between you two?

296
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:19,833
Why do you ask?

297
00:33:20,835 --> 00:33:23,036
[Floyd] You've been
smoking alone this past week

298
00:33:23,671 --> 00:33:26,373
and when you leave,
he leaves behind you.

299
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,977
Almost like
he's following you home,

300
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:30,444
keeping tabs on you.

301
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:37,417
Anything you want
to tell me about?

302
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:39,554
Are you done?

303
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:49,496
- Are you forgetting something?
- Floyd,

304
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:52,132
everything's fine between us,
don't worry about it.

305
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:00,642
[Floyd]
I'm glad to hear.

306
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:04,111
Go down to the boundary
and take some samples.

307
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:06,446
James will give you a hand.

308

309
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:22,829
James!

[doctor]
<i>Mr. Massey, a few days ago,</i>

311
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:28,870
<i>you had an accident at work.</i>

312
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:30,738
You almost drowned.

313
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:33,942
You were in shock when they
brought you into the emergency room.

314
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:37,912
And because of the near
drowning, you had hypoxia.

315
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,949
That's a low level of oxygen
in the blood.

316
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:44,018
This has caused some injury
to your brain

317
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:46,688
and other organ systems.

What happened?

337
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:53,668
You need to tell me
what's happening.

338
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:58,506

00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:17,144
I know I've been really mean
these past couple days

354
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:23,584
and you're going through a lot,
and I'm going of a lot.

355
00:41:26,454 --> 00:41:30,124
And I know that you're thinking
about what's best for me and our family,

356
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:34,762
but I need to know
what's on your mind.

357
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,538
Okay.

358
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:51,045
I'm going to go to the grocery
store to get a couple things.

359
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,782
I'll be back in a few hours.

360
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:13,934
James, I need to talk to you.

361
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:16,046
Yeah, I'm in the middle
of something.

362
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,705
What you're doing
right now can wait.

363
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,409
I need to know what happened
the day Michael fell in

364
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:24,111
because I've got the state
investigators crawling up my ass

365
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:26,313
wanting answers
that only you can give 'em

366
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:28,949
and you're not giving 'em to me.

367
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:29,817
He fell in.

368
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,053
Then why was your vest so clean?

369
00:42:34,455 --> 00:42:35,823
You have the report.

370
00:42:38,893 --> 00:42:40,294
Can I get back to work?

371
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:45,266
Go ahead and finish up.

[doctor] There is some concern
that the chemicals you were exposed

to might put you
at risk of cancer of the liver

419

as well as some
of the other organs and tissues.

420
00:51:02,129 --> 00:51:05,132
There is a new experimental drug
I would like to put you on

421
00:51:05,265 --> 00:51:08,736
which may help reduce your risk
of malignant conversion in cells

422

which have been damaged.

423
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:11,471
This may reduce your risk

of getting hepatocellular cancer

425
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,375

of the other organs, too,

or the kidneys.

all these books anyway?

[Michael] Here and there,
collected them over the years.

You got some pretty good ones

441
00:53:05,987 --> 00:53:07,427
that should be at home
on a bookshelf

442

in a dusty storage unit.

said you can start work next week.

Yeah, it's going
to be different this time.

447
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:23,981
[James] Yeah, that's for sure.
We've been going through all

448
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:25,940
these safety procedures
since the accident.

449
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:28,843

to move boxes.

[Michael] No, we're
here to find out the truth.

I told Emily mine and now
you're going to tell me yours.

would've given me that second job.

[James] You should have
never taken the first job.

464

I told you not to get involved
with this.

465
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:54,095
You got in trouble
'cause you crossed the line.

did you push me?

I'll give you the truth.

471
00:55:08,142 --> 00:55:10,578
When you went to Douglas,
it wasn't for money.

472
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:14,148
You wanted to prove you could kill
someone other than your own kid.

to God it'll be your last.

You're working with him,
aren't you?

That's why you pushed me.

- It was an accident.

The only reason you're standing
there right now is because of me.

Take a moment and think.

480

We're both involved now.

Douglas comes out to both of us.

she better not get my way.

Oh, she has nothing
to do with this.

You kill her, then you're going to
have two dead bodies you got to get rid.

It's not like I'd be doing
anything he hasn't done before.

that was an accident.

01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:32,299
I'll go in and get a clear shot.

528
01:00:33,434 --> 01:00:35,194
[James] She's there,
I'm going to have to say

529
01:00:35,236 --> 01:00:36,737
that I have
to talk to him in private.

530
01:00:37,104 --> 01:00:39,907
Like about the investigation
of something so...

531
01:00:41,075 --> 01:00:43,477
...let's keep this on the
same level, first floor.

532
01:00:44,044 --> 01:00:46,347
Has the kitchen and a bedroom.

533
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:48,325
Go down the hallway,
both are on the right.

534
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:50,651
If we're not in the kitchen,
just keep going by.

535
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:52,386
[Douglas]
Yeah.

536
01:00:56,123 --> 01:00:57,191
Move.

537
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:01,996
- [ominous music]
- [engine starts]

538
01:01:46,807 --> 01:01:47,975
[knocks on door]

539
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:55,458
- [Michael] Hey, what's going on man?
- [James] Hey.

540
01:01:55,482 --> 01:01:57,294
- [Michael] Come on in, man.
- [James] Sure, sure.

541
01:01:57,318 --> 01:01:59,062
- I came to check on you, how you feeling?
- [Michael] Uh,

542
01:01:59,086 --> 01:02:00,498
thanks, man.
You know, I'm doing all right.

543
01:02:00,522 --> 01:02:02,524
- Just taking it day by day.
- [James] Resting?

544
01:02:02,657 --> 01:02:03,924
[Michael]
Yeah, little bit.

545
01:02:04,058 --> 01:02:07,294
[indistinct conversation]

546
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:09,463
[ominous music continues]

547
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:22,269
[Douglas] <i>You know, it's been
a while since I pulled the trigger.</i>

548
01:03:24,305 --> 01:03:26,440
But I always love
a good challenge.

549
01:03:27,509 --> 01:03:29,744
[James] <i>Getting close
to him, that'll be difficult.</i>

550
01:03:30,277 --> 01:03:32,479
<i>At least one of us
tried to anyway.</i>

551
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,617
[Douglas] <i>You know, there
are better ways to kill a man</i>

552
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,352
<i>than to push him
into a pool of chemicals.</i>

553
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,389
I didn't, he just fell in.

554
01:03:44,726 --> 01:03:48,596
[Douglas] <i>Regardless,
we get a second chance.</i>

555
01:03:52,266 --> 01:03:54,968
[ominous music continues]

556
01:04:07,114 --> 01:04:10,351
[Michael] <i>I had my back
turned to the world for too long.</i>

557
01:04:12,052 --> 01:04:13,788
<i>Now I've turned around</i>

558
01:04:14,488 --> 01:04:17,224
<i>and what I see is
a world I neglected.</i>

559
01:04:18,593 --> 01:04:20,762
[James] He said we have
to wear hard hats at all times.

560
01:04:20,894 --> 01:04:22,463
Even on our cigarette breaks

561
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:26,500
A world I walked away from.

562
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,903
[Michael] <i>A world that has
become the one I deserve.</i>

563
01:04:31,438 --> 01:04:34,141
[James] Anyway, the
investigation's about to wrap up.

564
01:04:34,576 --> 01:04:37,444
- [Michael] Oh, that's good.
- [James] It'll be over soon.

565
01:04:38,847 --> 01:04:41,882
[ominous music]

566
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:18,245
[gun clicks]

567
01:06:21,215 --> 01:06:22,750
[Michael]
<i>But I see something,</i>

568
01:06:23,585 --> 01:06:25,553
<i>something I didn't see before.</i>

569
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:30,023
[ominous music continues]

570
01:06:33,227 --> 01:06:37,665
[Michael] <i>Someone walking
towards me, he looks familiar.</i>

571
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:43,403
<i>He isn't a stranger,</i>

572
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:46,774
<i>he's the man I used to be.</i>

573
01:06:52,246 --> 01:06:53,748
<i>My name is Michael Massey,</i>

574
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:58,151
<i>and I'm going to pull
this trigger one more time.</i>

575
01:07:00,822 --> 01:07:02,322
<i>Except this time...</i>

576
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:08,028
<i>...it won't be a mistake.</i>

577
01:07:09,664 --> 01:07:12,099
[dramatic music]

578
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:13,935
[popping and rustling]

579
01:07:14,067 --> 01:07:15,603
[breathing heavily]

580
01:07:19,007 --> 01:07:21,341
You motherfuckers!

581
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:24,546
[guns firing]

582
01:07:27,515 --> 01:07:30,552
[dramatic music continues]

583
01:07:39,661 --> 01:07:44,699
[dramatic music]
