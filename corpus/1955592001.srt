<i>YOU KNOW WHAT'S MORTIFYING?</i>

2
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:32,767
<i>SMACK IS LIKE THE LEISURE
SUIT OF THE NINETIES.</i>

00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,766
<i>INSTEAD OF WRECKING DAD'S
BUICK ON PROM NIGHT,</i>

4
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,709
<i>THESE LITTLE SUBURBAN
FUCKS ARE COPPING HABITS.</i>

5
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,377
<i>AND ODing IN THE REC ROOM.</i>

6
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:40,346
<i>AND YOU'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE...</i>

7
00:00:40,347 --> 00:00:42,216
<i>I NEVER GOT TO THE PROM.</i>

8
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:44,557
<i>TRADED MY CUMMERBUND
FOR TWO BAGS AND A RIG.</i>

9
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,595
<i>DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHY YOU
DID THE SHIT THAT YOU DID?</i>

10
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:49,696
<i>YOU EVER READ THAT INTERVIEW
WITH WILLIAM BURROUGHS.</i>

11
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:51,368
<i>WHERE THEY ASKED HIM
WHY HE SHOT HEROIN?</i>

12
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:53,409
<i>HE SAID, "SO I CAN GET UP
IN THE MORNING AND SHAVE."</i>

13
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,946
<i>YEAH. SO, IT WAS
LIKE A GROOMING THING.</i>

14
00:00:55,947 --> 00:00:58,275
<i>YOU KIDDING? I HATED TO SHAVE,</i>

15
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:01,121
<i>BUT IN HOLLYWOOD,

00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:24,367
IN YOUR LITTLE FAST-FOOD OUTFIT.

24
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:26,968
YEAH? WELL, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

25
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:30,346
SERVING AMERICA'S
FROZEN FISH NEEDS

26
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:31,516
IS NOT MY PRIMARY CALLING.

27
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:34,855
<i>I'M SORRY, COLLEGE BOY.</i>

28
00:01:34,856 --> 00:01:37,456
WHERE'D YOU GO?

29
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,270
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

30
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,276
UM, LET'S SEE.

31
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:49,317
GIVE ME A FISH SANDWICH
WITH EXTRA SAUCE.

32
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,988
YOU GOT THAT GOOD SAUCE?

33
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:55,664
TARTAR?

34
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:58,795
YEAH. YEAH. TARTAR.
GOB IT ON THERE.

35
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:12,396
OH, YEAH? SO, WHAT'S
YOUR M. O., HUH...

36
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:15,837
PICKING UP EZ BURGER
BOYS AT THE DRIVE-THRU,

37
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:17,978
- GETTING THEM BOUNCED OUT OF REHAB?
- UH-HUH.

38
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,776
HEY, YOU GUYS STILL OPEN?

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,280
HEY...

00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:23,524
YOU GUYS STILL OPEN?

41
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:25,724
YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY.

42
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:27,525
SORRY.

43
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:28,629
DO YOU HAVE SOME MATCHES?

44
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:29,801
I JUST NEED SOME MATCHES.

45
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:31,700
- MATCHES?
- YEAH.

46
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:33,573
YEAH, SURE. WE KEEP THEM
WITH THE KIDDIE MEALS.

47
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:36,044
I'LL GET THEM.

48
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:39,715
HEY, YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE
REHAB PATIENTS, AREN'T YOU?

49
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,025
<i>WHAT IS IT, WHIMPERING
WOUNDS OR SOMETHING?</i>

50
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:45,096
JESUS.

WHISPERING WINDS.

52
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:52,811
HEY, IT'S OBVIOUS.

53
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,482
YOU'RE TOO DARN SAD-LOOKING

54
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:56,691
JUST TO BE ANOTHER
RETARD IN A PINK VISOR.

55
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:00,289
IT'S RED.

56
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:02,429
OH.

57
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:06,444
DO YOU WANT TO GO HAVE
A CUP OF COFFEE?

58
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:09,945
YOU WANT ME TO GO HAVE
A CUP OF COFFEE

59
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:11,816
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW?

60
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,049
YEAH.

61
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:32,586
SHIT! SHIT!

62
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:35,095
WAIT. GGH!

63
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:37,996
ALL RIGHT.

64
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:41,408
OH, I WISH I WAS HIGH.

65
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:43,609
SHIT!

66
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,587
- AGH!
- <i>SORRY.</i>

67
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:49,388
IT'S OK.

68
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:52,971
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS
STRAIGHT BEFORE.

69
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:58,839
TRUST ME, ON SMACK,
I WAS A REAL STUD.

70
00:03:58,844 --> 00:04:00,884
THE FIRST TIME ANYBODY TOUCHED
ME AFTER I GOT CLEAN,

71
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:03,550
I THOUGHT, "JESUS, THAT'S
WHY I NEEDED DRUGS."

72
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:05,389
IT WAS 7 YEARS AGO.

73
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,594
YEAH. WELL, I GOT 92 DAYS,

74
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,055
BUT WHO'S COUNTING, RIGHT?

75
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:12,103
SO, WHAT, DID I
GET YOU IN TROUBLE?

76
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:14,007
<i>IT'S NO BIG THING.</i>

77
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:16,708
BESIDES, MY THREE-MONTH STRETCH OF
REHABILITATIVE FRY-COOK THERAPY

78
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:18,120
WAS UP TOMORROW, ANYWAY.

79
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:19,985
- I JUST MISSED THE MUGGING.
- THE WHAT?

80
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:23,886
<i>YOU GET A MUG
WHEN YOU FINISH YOUR STINT.</i>

81
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:25,604
RIGHT. I FORGOT THAT PART.

82
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:30,569
ANYWAY, I GOT TO GET
BACK TO L. A.

83
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:32,878
OH, GODDAMN, YOU'RE FROM L. A.?

84
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,919
I'M NOT, BUT I MOVED
OUT THERE TO PURSUE MY ART.

85
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,946
WHO SAYS?

86
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:38,523
I WANT YOU TO MEET BESSIE.

87
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:42,003
Man: <i>THAT'S WHERE
THEY KEPT MR. CHOMPERS.</i>

88
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:45,497
- MR. CHOMPERS, LIKE THE PUPPET?
- <i>YEAH.</i>

89
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:47,941
WHY, ARE YOU A PUPPETEER?

90
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:51,882
YES. I'M A PUPPETEER.
I'M A WRITER.

91
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:54,220
- YOU WRITE THAT CRAP?
- WROTE.

92
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,559
OH, GOD, I GET IT.

93
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,667
YOU'RE, LIKE, THIS ANGSTY,
ARTY, HEMMINGWAY TYPE

94
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,568
WHO, LIKE, SOLD OUT
TO HOLLYWOOD,

95
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:05,409
HIT THE NEEDLE, AND
ENDED UP IN REHAB.

96
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,980
YOU TV GEEKS DON'T DO
ANYTHING ORIGINAL, DO YOU?

97
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:11,522
ACTUALLY, THE TV GEEK PART

98
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:15,095
IS JUST A LITTLE SIDE EFFECT.

99
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:17,696
I WAS GETTING A LITTLE TOO
FUCKED UP IN NEW YORK,

100
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:19,738
SO I THOUGHT,

101
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,939
"I'LL MOVE OUT TO CALIFORNIA

102
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:24,013
AND GET AWAY FROM DRUGS."

103
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:33,002
<i>SO, YOU WENT TO L. A.
TO GET AWAY FROM DRUGS.</i>

104
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:34,769
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

105
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:37,607
I MISCALCULATED.

106
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:39,038
HEY, IT'S AN HONEST MISTAKE.

107
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:44,655
<i>HEY, I'M ALL ABOUT HONESTY.</i>

108
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:48,495
SO, YOU CAME OUT COLD, OR
DID YOU KNOW SOMEBODY?

109
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:51,766
UGH...

110
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,739
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW ALL THIS?

111
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,050
WELL, REALLY,
THERE'S ONLY TWO THINGS

112
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:57,945
YOU CAN DO IN A HOTEL ROOM,

113
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,689
AND WE ALREADY DID ONE OF THEM,

114
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,160
MORE OR LESS.

115
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:07,072
YEAH. I SURE SHOWED YOU
A GOOD TIME, DIDN'T I?

116
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:10,667
YEAH, EXCELLENT.

117
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:18,585
COME ON. TELL ME.

118
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,127
WELL, I HAD THIS FRIEND NICKY

119
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:23,698
WHO WAS KIND OF A DRUG
BUDDY FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

120
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,508
- CAREFUL, CAREFUL, CAREFUL.
- THIS IS GREAT.

121
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:28,776
YEAH. IT IS GREAT,
BUT THIS IS A BIG MACHINE.

122
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:30,677
I'VE NEVER HAD A CAR BEFORE.

123
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,581
- THIS IS EXCELLENT.
- REALLY? TRY IT OUT, MAN.

124
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,153
GIVE IT A SPIN.
TRY OUT THE BRAKES.

125
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:36,057
COME ON!

126
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:38,127
<i>HE WAS ONE OF THOSE GUYS
WHO WAS ALWAYS SCHEMING UP.</i>

127
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:39,196
<i>SHIT THAT ALMOST HAPPENED,</i>

128
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:40,797
<i>AND I WAS POPPING
SO MANY OF HIS PILLS,</i>

129
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,139
<i>IT ALL SOUNDED GREAT.</i>

130
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:45,805
WELL, HE GAVE THE SCRIPT
TO A GUY HE PLAYS GOLF WITH

131
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:48,881
WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE
A LOT OF MONEY... MOE LEVINE.

132
00:06:48,884 --> 00:06:50,753
CHECK IT OUT. MOE LEVINE.

133
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:52,691
THIS GUY MOE LEVINE READ IT.

134
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:55,596
HE LIKES IT. HE LOVES IT.

135
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:57,867
SAYS HE MIGHT WANT
TO PUT ON THE PLAY.

136
00:06:57,868 --> 00:07:00,907
HA HA! YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

137
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:03,508
NO. I AM NOT KIDDING YOU.
I AM NOT KIDDING.

138
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:04,883
AND YOU'VE JUST BEEN KEEPING
THIS UNDER YOUR HAT?

139
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,289
HE REALLY WANTS TO PUT IT ON?

140
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,515
HE MIGHT. NO.
HE SERIOUSLY MIGHT.

141
00:07:08,523 --> 00:07:10,931
- THE PLAY IS THE THING.
- THIS IS GREAT, MAN.

142
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:13,228
WHAT A DAY. WHAT A DAY
TO BE CRUISING AROUND.

143
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:17,005
I THINK WE MADE A FINE CHOICE.

144
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:19,136
I NEVER HAD A CAR, MAN.

145
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:21,254
OK. SO IT'S LIKE BOY MEETS
CHUCKLEHEAD, AND THEN WHAT,

146
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:23,718
BOY GETS THIS TERRIFIC JOB

147
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,226
WRITING ALIEN PUPPET SITCOM?

148
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:29,057
WELL, IT WASN'T REALLY
THAT SIMPLE.

149
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:31,804
I KIND OF HAD TO SLEEP
MY WAY TO THE MIDDLE.

150
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:35,043
REALLY? YOU AND NICKY?

151
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:37,981
MM, NO.

152
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:40,121
NICKY AND I DREW THE LINE
AT NECKING.

153
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:42,189
ACTUALLY, HE HAD THIS GIRLFRIEND

154
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,329
WHO HAD A GIRLFRIEND
WHO NEEDED A GREEN CARD.

155
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,027
THERE'S ABOUT 200 OF
THESE TURKISH FISHERMEN

156
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,303
STANDING AROUND ON THE DOCK,

157
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:49,709
AND, BECAUSE IT'S A HOLIDAY,

158
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,035
THEY WERE FALLING OVER DRUNK,

159
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,848
AND I'M WEARING THESE
INCREDIBLY HIGH HEELS

160
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:55,645
AND HOLDING THIS MASSIVE CAKE
DONE UP IN THE AMERICAN FLAG.

161
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:57,119
SANDRA, WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING

162
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,390
SOUNDS LIKE A WONDERFUL
SCENE FOR JERRY,

163
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:00,225
WHO'S A PRETTY GOOD WRITER.

164
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,856
I TELL YOU, BY THE TIME I'D
FINISHED RUNNING THAT GAUNTLET,

165
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:03,973
I LOOKED LIKE I'D
BEEN CAKE WRESTLING.

166
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:10,076
VOLA, IS MY FUTURE HUSBAND
ALWAYS LIKE THIS?

167
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,249
I MEAN, HE CAN
BEHAVE NORMALLY, RIGHT?

168
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,750
NO, NOT REALLY,

169
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:15,023
ESPECIALLY WHEN BENNY
HAS MADE A HOUSE CALL.

170
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:16,592
WHICH HE HASN'T

171
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:17,961
BECAUSE I DON'T ASSOCIATE
WITH BENNY ANYMORE.

172
00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:19,702
YOU'VE MADE THAT CLEAR,
AND I UNDERSTOOD IT.

173
00:08:19,703 --> 00:08:21,969
- ASK JERRY.
- WHO'S BENNY?

174
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,340
Vola: <i>HE'S A PREPUBESCENT
DRUG DEALER.</i>

175
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:26,611
WHAT'S THIS, HEIDEGGER?
YOU A BIG FAN OF HIS?

176
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:28,716
WELL, I'M TRYING
TO GET THROUGH IT.

177
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,317
IT'S NOT EXACTLY LIGHT
SUMMER READING.

178
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,989
YEAH, BUT IT'S PROBABLY GOOD
FOR, LIKE, PLOTLINES

179
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,330
AND CHARACTER NAMES,
STUFF LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

180
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:36,765
HAVE YOU SEEN "MR. CHOMPERS"?

181
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,636
I DON'T HAVE A TV.

182
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:40,307
Nicky: <i>OOH, SEE WHAT I MEAN?</i>

183
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:42,175
<i>THIS IS LIKE A GOOD,
LIKE, GIVE AND TAKE.</i>

184
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:44,176
THIS IS, LIKE, SHE LIKES TO
BULLSHIT, YOU LIKE TO BULLSHIT.

185
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,900
- THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
- CAN I HAVE THE PIPE?

186
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:48,918
CAN I HAVE... YES. YOU
MAY HAVE THE PIPE.

187
00:08:48,924 --> 00:08:50,434
IT'S OVER HERE,
AND THEN IT'S OVER HERE.

188
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:53,026
AND THEN IT'S OVER THERE,
AND THEN IT'S OVER HERE.

189
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,432
GREAT.

190
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,441
Sandra: OH, JERRY, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO CHARM ME.

191
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,676
WE'RE ONLY GETTING MARRIED
ON PAPER, YOU KNOW?

192
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:00,677
YOU GOT TO GET A LOAD OF THIS.
WHAT IS THIS OUTFIT?

193
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:03,091
- THIS IS LIKE MAD MAX HERE.
- YEAH.

194
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:04,815
WHAT IS THIS, LEATHER?

195
00:09:04,822 --> 00:09:06,122
ACTUALLY, IT'S JEWISH LEATHER.

196
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:07,764
IT'S DESIGNED FOR HUMILIATION.

197
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:10,165
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? SHE'S OK.

198
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,366
SHE'S OK. SHE'S BRITISH.

199
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:14,975
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

200
00:09:14,976 --> 00:09:17,406
- MEANS SHE'S BRITISH.
- SHE'S COOL.

201
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:19,651
YOU'RE GONNA REALLY DIG HER
WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW HER.

202
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:20,920
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW HER, VOLA.

203
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:22,061
I'M JUST GETTING MARRIED TO HER.

204
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,956
I'M JUST SAYING SHE'S NICE.

205
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,800
YEAH, IF YOU GOT FOR THAT STUDIED
NONCHALANT BRIT TYPE OF THING.

206
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:29,804
SUCK MY DICK.

207
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:31,905
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- WONDERFUL.

208
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,209
YOU'RE GIRLFRIEND'S FACE
IS TWO INCHES FROM MY ASS.

209
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:35,682
- I'M IN SEVENTH HEAVEN.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

210
00:09:35,684 --> 00:09:37,860
HEY, JERRY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE A FICTION WRITER.

211
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,125
- OH, NICKY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT?

212
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,764
SHE HAD THE BOOK, AND I
SAID THAT YOU WERE IN IT.

213
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:45,935
I'M NOT EMBARRASSED ABOUT THAT. I'M PROUD
OF THAT. I'M NOT GONNA BACK OFF FROM THAT.

214
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:48,475
YOU WON AN AWARD FOR THAT. HE WON AN AWARD.
HE'S A GOOD WRITER.

215
00:09:48,476 --> 00:09:50,805
YOU KNOW, JERRY, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD COME DOWN AND MEET CRAIG.

216
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:52,854
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALWAYS
LOOKING FOR NEW WRITERS.

217
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:55,956
OH, ON "MR. MUNCHMAN"?

218
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:57,796
- "MR. CHOMPERS," ACTUALLY,
- RIGHT.

219
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,765
AND WE REALLY DO TRY TO PUSH THE
FORM, STRANGE AS IT MAY SOUND.

220
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,737
WELL, I'M SURE MY
"HUSTLER" CREDENTIALS

221
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:04,208
WILL JUST SLIP ME
RIGHT IN THE DOOR THERE.

222
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:05,907
SO, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

223
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:07,818
ARE WE TRYING TO PLAN
A WEDDING, OR WHAT?

224
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:09,375
WHEN YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

225
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:11,788
- WHAT ABOUT NOW?
- NOW?

226
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:13,189
- <i>YEAH.</i>
- RIGHT NOW?

227
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,231
THERE'S AN ALL-NIGHT CHAPEL
DOWN ON EL DORADO.

228
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:16,529
IT'D BE PRETTY COOL.

229
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,804
THAT'S RIGHT. THERE IS.
SHOULD WE DO THAT?

230
00:10:19,805 --> 00:10:22,775
JERRY, TODAY
IS A GOOD DAY TO DIE.

231
00:10:22,778 --> 00:10:24,778
Woman: HOW MUCH DID SHE PAY YOU?

232
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:29,156
- WHAT?
- TO GET MARRIED.

233
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:31,557
30,000.

234
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:33,832
- THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
- MM-HMM.

235
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:39,209
DID YOU LOVE HER?

236
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,017
OCCASIONALLY.

237
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,554
DID SHE LOVE YOU?

238
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:47,355
HMM...

239
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,064
I THINK SHE SAW US

240
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:52,335
AS THIS POTENTIAL
HOLLYWOOD POWER COUPLE

241
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:54,036
IN THE MAKING,

242
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,847
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE LOVE.

243
00:10:57,848 --> 00:10:59,517
Woman: <i>"MR. CHOMPERS."
PLEASE HOLD.</i>

244
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:01,387
SO, DO YOU FEEL
DIFFERENT BEING MARRIED?

245
00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:04,798
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
KEEP IT PROFESSIONAL IN HERE, OK?

246
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,495
OH, OK.

247
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:08,998
SORRY I'M LATE,
BUT I WAS ACTUALLY DOING

248
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:12,209
THE ONE PART OF THIS JOB
THAT I ENJOY.

249
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,448
I WAS MEETING WITH A GROUP
OF LIBRARIANS

250
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:20,124
WHO WANT ME TO DEVELOP
A MR. CHOMPERS LITERACY PROGRAM.

251
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,155
THIS FELLA TESTS
HIGHER THAN BARNEY.

252
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:24,199
I'M AMAZED.

253
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,839
IT'S REALLY QUITE
FANTASTIC, JERRY.

254
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,437
IT'S LIKE CRAIG HAS DISCOVERED

255
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,210
- SOME KIND OF UNTAPPED MYTH.
- HMM.

256
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:35,164
JERRY, SANDRA SHOWED ME SOME OF
YOUR FICTION AND YOUR AWARDS,

257
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:39,995
AND I HAVE TO SAY,
POWERFUL STUFF,

258
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,937
ALMOST TOO POWERFUL.

259
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:45,308
I'M WONDERING IF YOUR MIND CAN

260
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:49,149
FUNCTION DOWN ON OUR LEVEL.

261
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,190
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE
OUR LITTLE FRIEND HERE?

262
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,625
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

263
00:11:54,628 --> 00:12:00,468
I'M SURE YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS
FOR OUR LOVEABLE PUPPET.

264
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:02,512
I'D SAY FUCK THE
LOVEABLE PUPPET.

265
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,851
<i>THIS GUY IS A WEB-TOED METAPHOR
FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM GONE BAD.</i>

266
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:11,460
I SEE MR. CHOMPERS AS
A MODERN-DAY TOM JOAD.

267
00:12:11,461 --> 00:12:13,631
Woman: <i>SHE'S IN A
MEETING RIGHT NOW.</i>

268
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,073
<i>CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?</i>

269
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,244
I GREW UP IN PACIFIC GROVE.

270
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:22,245
I HUNG OUT ON CANNERY ROW.

271
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:23,888
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN THERE, SANDRA?

272
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:25,256
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

273
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:27,085
I STARTED READING...
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

274
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:29,032
- STEINBECK.
- STEINBECK WHEN I WAS NINE.

275
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:30,630
- I LIKE THIS.
- THE LITTLE GUY.

276
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:35,341
THE LITTLE GUY,
EVERYMAN, THE TRAMP.

277
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:38,347
I LIKE THIS.
THE DEFENDER OF THE COMMON MAN.

278
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:42,518
GANDHI. IT'S GOING TOO FAR.

279
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:46,604
THIS COULD SERIOUSLY RESHAPE
THE SECOND-SEASON BIBLE, SANDRA.

280
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:48,999
HERE'S A PIECE OF SHIT, JERRY.

281
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:52,676
I WROTE IT AND REWROTE IT,
BUT IT AIN'T WORKING.

282
00:12:52,677 --> 00:12:57,285
IF YOU CAN MAKE THAT WORK,
YOU'RE ON, OKAY?

283
00:12:57,286 --> 00:12:59,556
OKAY.

284
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:02,958
SANDRA, GET ME A COPY
OF "GRAPES OF WRATH."

285
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:06,638
JERRY, GOOD MEETING YOU.

286
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,639
Jerry: <i>SO, NOW I GOT TO REWRITE
CRAIG'S PIECE OF SHIT,</i>

287
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:11,581
<i>AND I'M SLEEPING
ON NICKY'S COUCH.</i>

288
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,086
Woman: <i>WERE YOU GETTING HIGH?</i>

289
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:15,187
<i>MAINTENANCE, YOU KNOW?</i>

290
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:16,589
<i>ENOUGH POT TO BLIND AN OX.</i>

291
00:13:16,592 --> 00:13:21,032
<i>AND WHATEVER ELSE
WAS LAYING AROUND.</i>

292
00:13:43,411 --> 00:13:46,151
HELLO?

293
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:53,003
MOM...

294
00:13:57,473 --> 00:14:00,783
MOM, THIS ISN'T THE BANK.
THIS IS JERRY IN CALIFORNIA.

295
00:14:00,784 --> 00:14:04,050
YOU CALLED ME, MOM.

296
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:07,693
OK. ALL RIGHT.
FINE, MOM. ARE YOU OK?

297
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:10,274
MOM, ARE YOU OK?

298
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:15,107
OK. MOM? I REALLY MEAN THIS.

299
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:18,008
I HAVE TO GO. I HOPE YOU
HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY.

300
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:21,424
GOOD-BYE, MOM. MOM, GOOD-BYE.

301
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:45,535
Man: <i>SUICIDE IS ONE OF THE
GREAT MYSTERIES OF OUR TIME.</i>

302
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:48,166
<i>WHEN WARREN STAHL
TOOK HIS OWN LIFE,</i>

303
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:50,113
<i>HE TOOK A PART OF US WITH HIM.</i>

304
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:52,582
Woman: <i>GOD, BABY, THAT'S
AT SUCH A FORMATIVE AGE.</i>

305
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:54,324
Man: <i>OH, A TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE WASTE.</i>

306
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:57,390
<i>I MEAN, HE ACHIEVED SO MUCH.</i>

307
00:14:57,393 --> 00:14:59,062
OH, GOD! HE HATES ME.

308
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:01,003
I AM STEEL. STEEL FEELS NOTHING.

309
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:06,075
WHY, WARREN?

310
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:08,247
Why did you leave me with them?

311
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:09,617
They hate me.

312
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,148
We don't hate you, Mom.

313
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:13,023
Correct me if I'm wrong, Brad,

314
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:15,734
But isn't it illegal to name
a cat Warren in this state?

315
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:22,208
I want to go, too.

316
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:29,416
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

317
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:32,696
IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

318
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:36,504
I WROTE THAT, LIKE, 10 DAYS AGO.

319
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,105
I THINK YOU SHOULD
BE REALLY PROUD.

320
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:41,714
HMM, "PROUD" ISN'T
THE FIRST WORD

321
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:44,345
THAT COMES TO MIND.

322
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:46,163
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'VE HAD A CRUSH ON YOU

323
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:48,527
SINCE THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU.

324
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,368
Woman: <i>DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE SHE WAS TOO BAD.</i>

325
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,777
Jerry: <i>SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL,
SHE WAS WITTY,</i>

326
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:56,744
<i>AND SHE HAD NO IDEA
WHO I REALLY WAS.</i>

327
00:15:56,745 --> 00:16:00,215
<i>DID YOU KNOW WHO SHE REALLY WAS?</i>

328
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:01,486
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

329
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:05,157
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HANG ON.

330
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:06,802
ARE YOU OK?

331
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,536
Woman: <i>DON'T TELL ME. NOT
THE MEDICINE CABINET.</i>

332
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:15,247
Jerry: <i>OH, YEAH.
BY THEN, I WAS A PRO.</i>

333
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:17,788
<i>YOU KNOW THE OLD
COUGH-AND-FLUSH TECHNIQUE?</i>

334
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,760
<i>COUGH WHEN YOU OPEN,
FLUSH WHEN YOU SHUT IT.</i>

335
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:23,565
Sandra: <i>JERRY, ARE YOU OK?</i>

336
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,766
YEAH. I'M FINE.

337
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,610
Jerry: <i>WORKS PRETTY GOOD UNLESS
YOU FORGET TO PUT BACK THE DRUGS.</i>

338
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,247
<i>THEN YOU HAVE TO FLUSH TWICE
AND PLEAD BAD PLUMBING.</i>

339
00:16:46,377 --> 00:16:48,146
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WAS
PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST EPISODES

340
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:49,477
<i>WE'VE HAD THIS SERIES.</i>

341
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:52,623
REALLY? HOO, THAT'S
KIND OF A SCARY THOUGHT.

342
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:57,164
DO YOU WANT TO STAY THE NIGHT?

343
00:16:57,165 --> 00:16:59,695
NO. I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M GONNA HEAD HOME.

344
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:02,344
IT'S GETTING KIND OF LATE,
AND I GOT TO GET UP TOMORROW,

345
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:04,547
ALL THAT... STUFF.

346
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:06,316
<i>JERRY, I'VE HAD AN IDEA.</i>

347
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,186
YOU HAVEN'T FOUND ANYWHERE
TO LIVE YET, HAVE YOU?

348
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:10,124
UH, NO.

349
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,825
NOT REALLY TOO GOOD
AT LOOKING FOR PLACES.

350
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,500
I'M MUCH BETTER MOVING OUT.

351
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,779
WELL, I WAS JUST
THINKING THAT, YOU KNOW,

352
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,580
IT COULD REALLY HELP
MY GREEN CARD SITUATION

353
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:26,289
<i>IF WE LIVED UNDER THE SAME ROOF.</i>

354
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,160
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
THIS SPARE BEDROOM

355
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:30,400
THAT I NEVER GO INTO
WHICH YOU COULD WORK IN

356
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:32,936
<i>UNDISTURBED ALL DAY,
AS I'D BE AT WORK.</i>

357
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:34,707
OBVIOUSLY, I DON'T MEAN
"MOVING IN" MOVING IN.

358
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,778
RIGHT. THE ONLY THING IS,
THERE'S ACTUALLY THIS GUY

359
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,587
WHO I HAVE KIND OF GONE DOWN
THE ROAD WITH ON A PLACE,

360
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:44,927
AND I FEEL LIKE I'D BE
KIND OF LEAVING HIM

361
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:47,928
IN THE LURCH IF I JUST...

362
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,803
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

363
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:53,814

366
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:01,526
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO
TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

367
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:03,198
I'M, LIKE, STILL
SPINNING FROM THAT,

368
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,767
AND IT WAS...

369
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:07,738
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN HAVE
A DRIVER'S LICENSE YET, OK?

370
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,377
THAT'S WHERE I'M AT, SO...

371
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:13,785
BUT I'M JUST GONNA...

372
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:18,326
I'M GONNA LET MYSELF
OUT, ALL RIGHT?

373
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,707
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A DRIVER'S LICENSE?

374
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,608
Jerry: <i>I DIDN'T HAVE A WALLET, AND
I WAS MAKING FIVE GRAND A WEEK.</i>

375
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:31,856
ALL THAT MONEY,
WHAT ABOUT THE SWIMMING POOLS

376
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:37,264
AND DOING COKE
IN LIMOS ALL NIGHT?

377
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:39,695
TRY SLEEPING ON NICKY'S COUCH,

378
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:41,014
EATING HIS PAINKILLERS,

379
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:44,576

- BENNY'S PERCODAN, THEY'RE GONE.

385
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,326
WHAT DID I DO WITH THEM?

386
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:09,657
DID I PUT THEM IN THERE?
DID I MISPLACE THEM?

387
00:19:09,664 --> 00:19:10,774
- YOU KEEP THEM IN THIS THING?
- YES.

388
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,334
NO. THEY'RE NOT IN THERE.

00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:15,875
- DID I PUT THEM HERE?
- ALL RIGHT.

391
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:17,906
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THEY COULDN'T
HAVE JUST GOTTEN UP AND WALKED AWAY.

392
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:20,250
LET'S FIND THEM, MAN, ALL RIGHT?

393
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:21,991
LET'S SCOUR THE HOUSE. YOU TAKE THAT SIDE.
I'LL TAKE HERE.

394
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:23,624
OK. SCOUR, BUT, I MEAN,
BE THOROUGH

395
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,394
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO GO
THROUGH ALL THAT STUFF.

396
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:27,595
THEY GOT TO BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

397
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,435
COULD VOLA HAVE TAKEN THEM?

398
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:31,005
IS THAT POSSIBLE THAT VOLA
COULD'VE TAKEN MY DRUGS?

399
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:32,536
I DOUBT VOLA WOULD DO THAT.

400
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:34,312
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
SHE WOULD DO IT,

401
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:35,651

- OKAY. EXCUSE ME.

428
00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:52,598
LET ME FINISH THIS.
YOU AND I GO OUT.

OH, WELL, YEAH.

497
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:41,231
I KNEW WE HAD
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

498
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,371
IT TOOK ME EVERYTHING I
HAD, BUT I GOT CLEAN.

499
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:46,910
YEAH. I KNOW, REMEMBER?

500
00:26:46,911 --> 00:26:48,814
WHY, BECAUSE YOU'RE,
WHAT, 50 DAYS CLEAN?

501
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,075
THAT'S NOTHING. YOU'RE
STILL A FUCKING JUNKIE.

502
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:51,853
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE
TO GO BACK TO REHAB

503
00:26:51,854 --> 00:26:54,992
AND I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

504
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:57,363
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

505
00:26:57,364 --> 00:26:58,900
I'M NOT AFRAID, JERRY.

506
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:01,071
BULLSHIT, YOU'RE OUT HERE
COMPLETELY ALONE

507
00:27:01,072 --> 00:27:05,279
IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING
NOWHERE WORKING SOME WEIRD JOB.

508
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,785
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
YOU ACTUALLY HAD FUN?

509
00:27:07,786 --> 00:27:10,086
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU ACTUALLY
LET YOURSELF HAVE A GOOD TIME?

510
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,390
NOW, HERE, RIGHT? THIS IS IT.

511
00:27:12,394 --> 00:27:15,066
NOW, RIGHT, THE LAST DAY,
AND IT JUST FREAKS YOU OUT.

512
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,467
- YOU ARE TOTALLY AFRAID.
- AND YOU'RE SO FUCKING INTIMATE.

513
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:21,782
FUCK?

514
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,950
WHAT?

515
00:27:26,356 --> 00:27:28,796
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME.

516
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:38,179
MY NAME IS KITTY.

517
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:43,857
KITTY?

518
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:46,395
IS THAT FUNNY?

519
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:47,826
NO. I JUST...

520
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:51,973
I DIDN'T TAKE YOU
FOR A KITTY, BUT...

521
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:54,344
- WHAT?
- KITTY. AWW.

522
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:56,875
- WHAT?
- KITTY.

523
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,589
- KITTY.
- KITTY.

524
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,990
- KITTY.
- OHH...

525
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:06,174
MM, I GOT TO GO.

526
00:28:07,806 --> 00:28:10,946
YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW.
YOU'LL MISS THE BEST PART.

527
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:13,115
<i>BY NOW, SANDRA AND I
WERE DEEP INTO THE CHARADE.</i>

528
00:28:14,252 --> 00:28:16,321
WHOOPS, SORRY. DROPPED THE IRON.

529
00:28:16,322 --> 00:28:17,958
<i>I'LL GIVE YOU A TYPICAL DAY.</i>

530

531
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,064
JERRY, I'VE GOT TO GO NOW.

532
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:22,195
JERRY, I'VE GOT TO...

533
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,371
NO. OH.

534
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:25,941
Jerry: <i>TWO HOURS LATER,</i>

535
00:28:25,942 --> 00:28:28,312
<i>I SLIME OUT OF BED
AND START MY REGIMEN.</i>

536
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:31,018
<i>I WAKE UP, UNCROSS MY EYES.</i>

537
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,455
ALL RIGHT, OW!

538
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:35,486
♪ WHEAT GRASS, WHEAT GRASS ♪

539
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:39,344
<i>LITTLE WHEAT GRASS BECAUSE
HEALTHY EATING IS MY LIFE.</i>

540
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:46,076
<i>THEN IT'S OUTSIDE
FOR A FIVE-MILE JOG.</i>

541
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:47,482
Kitty: <i>WAIT A MINUTE.</i>

542
00:28:47,484 --> 00:28:49,360
<i>YOU'D SHOOT HEROIN
AND RUN FIVE MILES?</i>

543
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,955
<i>HEY, I WAS AN L. A. JUNKIE.
I HAD TO STAY FIT.</i>

544
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:53,301
<i>THEN IT WAS OFF TO BEVERLY HILLS.</i>

545
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:56,236
<i>TO CRANK OUT THE SNAPPY PATTER.</i>

546
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:00,009
HELLO.

547
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,480
JERRY, MY GOD,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

548
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:03,115
DID YOU READ MY NOTES?

549
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,146
NO, CRAIG. I DID NOT READ THE
NOTES BECAUSE I JUST GOT HERE,

550
00:29:05,153 --> 00:29:07,192
BUT I'D BE HAPPY
TO READ THEM IMMEDIATELY.

551
00:29:07,193 --> 00:29:09,831
OK. IT'S OBVIOUSLY A LOGISTICAL,
NOT A CREATIVE, PROBLEM.

552
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:12,430
PLEASE.

553
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:15,006
HELLO, JERRY. THIS SHOW SUCKS.

554
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:17,307
<i>AND YOU'RE THE ONLY
MOTHERFUCKER THAT CAN HELP US.</i>

555
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:18,546
HE'S FREAKING ME OUT, CRAIG.

556
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:20,016
HE'S FREAKING ME OUT
WITH THE PUPPET.

557
00:29:20,017 --> 00:29:22,017
OK. WE START THE FIRST ACT
WITH A FLASHBACK

558
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:25,091
TO SEE MR. CHOMPERS SEEING BRAD AND
KATIE HAVING THEIR FIRST FIGHT,

559
00:29:25,093 --> 00:29:27,032
ONLY WE AGE KATIE AND BRAD
BACK FIVE YEARS

560
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,138
AND THEN BEGIN THE SECOND ACT
EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.

561
00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:31,465
WE HAVE LITTLE MR. CHOMPERS
HERE GOADING EVERYBODY ON.

562
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:32,975
AH, AH, HE GOES
TO THE FREEZER...

563
00:29:32,976 --> 00:29:34,376
COME ON, MAN. GIVE IT TO ME.
GIVE IT TO ME.

564
00:29:34,378 --> 00:29:40,356
OK, TO REPAIR AN
ORANDALAN FLESH TRANS...

565
00:29:40,357 --> 00:29:42,387
THAT'S GOOD. I LIKE THAT.
I LOVE THAT.

566
00:29:42,394 --> 00:29:44,532
IT'S BETTER. JERRY, DIG IN.

567
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,043
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
WALK HIM THROUGH IT.

568
00:29:46,044 --> 00:29:47,395
I GOT TO CALL THE NETWORK.

569
00:29:47,404 --> 00:29:49,407
- I GOT TO PEE.
- HAVE A GOOD PEE.

570
00:29:49,408 --> 00:29:51,478
Jerry: <i>THEN I'D LEAVE THE
OFFICE, HOP IN THE CADDY,</i>

571
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:53,649
<i>TURN ON SOME

577
00:30:06,182 --> 00:30:10,375
<i>AND SURROGATE FAMILY

578
00:30:10,383 --> 00:30:13,255
AW, JERRY, MAN, YOU
DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

579
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:15,594
HEY, I'M JEWISH. I NEVER GOT
TO DO THIS WHEN I WAS A KID.

580
00:30:15,595 --> 00:30:17,495
Miguel: YOU DIDN'T HAVE A
CHRISTMAS TREE? HOW COME?

581
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:18,998
<i>AYUDARLO. AYUDARLO.</i>

582
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,401
YOU HEARD OF THE JEWS,
MIGUEL, RIGHT?

583
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:23,108
YEAH. SO WHAT?

584
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:25,719
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

585
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,085
SO, HOW'S MIGUEL
DOING IN SCHOOL?

586
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:30,086
- HE'S DOING GOOD.
- YEAH?

587
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,360
OH, HE COULD DO BETTER.

588
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:34,631
DOES HE DO HIS
HOMEWORK EVERY NIGHT?

589
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:39,683
YEAH, BUT HE COULD
APPLY HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE.

590
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:44,052
WHEN YOU SAY, "APPLY HIMSELF,"

591
00:30:44,053 --> 00:30:45,554
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

592
00:30:45,555 --> 00:30:48,785
HE COULD GET BETTER GRADES.
HE'S SMARTER THAN THAT.

593
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:51,364
SMART KID, I'M TELLING YOU.

594
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:53,565
I KNOW, BUT HE DOESN'T
HELP ME AROUND THE HOUSE.

595
00:30:53,571 --> 00:30:58,378
I NEED HELP.
THIS PLACE IS TOO BIG.

596
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:01,749
HE NEEDS, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
LIKE, A FATHER FIGURE.

597
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:03,692
HE DON'T NEED NO FATHER.
HE GOT ME.

598
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:05,730
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I
SHOULD, LIKE, TAKE HIM

599
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,698
TO A BALL GAME SOMETIME
OR SOMETHING...

600
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,535
YEAH, RIGHT.

601
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:11,706
YOU KNOW, JUST
PAL AROUND WITH HIM.

602
00:31:11,707 --> 00:31:13,375
<i>OH, HE'S JUST LIKE HIS FATHER.</i>

603
00:31:13,376 --> 00:31:15,106
<i>HE EATS, AND HE EATS,
AND HE NEVER GETS FAT.</i>

604
00:31:15,113 --> 00:31:17,116
<i>WHERE DOES IT ALL GO?</i>

605
00:31:17,117 --> 00:31:18,517
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

606
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,760
GOT A LITTLE SCHNAUZER
DOWN THERE?

607
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:22,726
- YOU WANT A TOMATO?
- TOMATO?

608
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:24,665
- IS IT ORGANIC?
- <i>YEAH.</i>

609
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,566
<i>FRESH OFF THE PRODUCE TRUCK.</i>

610
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,338
OH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. NO.

611
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:30,439
NEVER MIND. I'M NOT HUNGRY.

612
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:32,714
JERRY ONLY EATS HEALTHY.

613
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:35,045
TOMATOES ARE HEALTHY.

614
00:31:35,053 --> 00:31:39,060
SOAKED IN CHEMICALS, AMIGO.

615
00:31:39,061 --> 00:31:41,431
HA HA HA!

616
00:31:44,338 --> 00:31:48,378
HO HO. HO HO. OH.

617
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:52,349
HEY, JERRY, AREN'T YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE GOING?

618
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:01,872
EXCUSE ME, SIR. TICKET.

619
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:04,077
- HEY.
- JERRY, WHAT HAPPENED?

620
00:32:04,078 --> 00:32:06,414
MY BAD. MY BAD.

621
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:09,354
I WAS CAUGHT IN THIS
AMAZING WRITING GROOVE.

622
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:12,355
I WAS IN THIS WRITING HEAVEN

623
00:32:12,361 --> 00:32:14,600
FOR, LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG,

624
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,769
AND I TOTALLY LOST TRACK
OF EVERYTHING.

625
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,209
I MEAN, I WAS ON MARS,
OVER THE MOON.

626
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,108
I MEAN, STUFF WAS
COMING OUT OF ME.

627
00:32:21,112 --> 00:32:23,215
IT WAS LIKE I WAS CHANNELING
STRENBERG OR SOMETHING

628
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:24,386
BUT, LIKE,
A FUNNY VERSION OF IT,

629
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:25,815
AND I ZONED.

630
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:28,091
- I'M JANA FARMER.
- HEY. HEY.

631
00:32:28,092 --> 00:32:29,561
I TRIED CALLING
THE HOUSE, JERRY.

632
00:32:29,562 --> 00:32:32,199
I KNOW. THAT PHONE,
OKAY, THE RINGER'S FUCKED...

633
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,569
EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE,
BUT IT'S REALLY...

634
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,439
AND THIS PLACE... AM I CRAZY?

635
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,709
THIS PLACE USED TO BE ON LA BREA

636
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,347
BECAUSE I'M DRIVING
UP, UM, LA BREA,

637
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:40,848
AND IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE,

638
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:44,121
AND THEN THE GUY TELLS ME
THAT IT'S OVER HERE.

639
00:32:44,124 --> 00:32:46,461
ANYWAY, I'M REALLY SORRY
WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE,

640
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:47,902
- YOU KNOW, TO EAT AND...
- YOU HUNGRY?

641
00:32:47,903 --> 00:32:49,899
BECAUSE THE CHEF IS DOING
A CURBSIDE THING NOW.

642
00:32:49,903 --> 00:32:51,672
YOU CAN JUST PULL THE CAR UP,

643
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:53,483
AND HE'LL RUN OUT WITH AN
ARUGULA SHAKE OR SOMETHING.

644
00:32:53,484 --> 00:32:56,246
- ARE YOU BEING... HA HA HA!
- OOH! YEAH.

645
00:32:56,248 --> 00:32:57,478
NOT HUNGRY.

646
00:32:57,484 --> 00:32:58,853
JANA IS A GOOD FRIEND
OF MINE, JERRY,

647
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:01,592
AND SHE'S READ YOUR WORK,
AND SHE LIKES IT.

648
00:33:01,593 --> 00:33:02,863
OH, I LOVE IT. I LOVE YOUR WORK.

649
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:04,397
I THINK YOU'RE
A TREMENDOUS WRITER.

650
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:05,838
OH, NO. I'M NOT
A TREMENDOUS WRITER.

651
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,405
I HEAR YOU ARE
A FANTASTIC AGENT.

652
00:33:08,406 --> 00:33:09,836
AND I'M NOT JUST BLOWING
SMOKE UP YOUR CRACK.

653
00:33:09,843 --> 00:33:12,112
I MEAN, SANDRA TELLS ME
THE REAL DEAL ON THIS SHIT.

654
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:14,283
SHE SAYS THAT AMONG YOUR PEERS,

655
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,557
YOU'RE CONSIDERED
THE BEST AGENT IN THE WORLD.

656
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:19,697
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'VE HEARD THAT

657
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,326
BECAUSE I'D LOVE
TO REPRESENT YOU.

658
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,302
I THINK YOU'VE GOT A HUGE
CAREER AHEAD OF YOU.

659
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:26,144
OH, I'LL FUCK IT UP,
GIVE ME A CHANCE.

660
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:28,345
<i>NOT IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO
SAY ABOUT IT, LISTEN.</i>

661
00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:30,446
I REGRET WE DIDN'T GET A
CHANCE TO TALK OVER DINNER,

662
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,619
BUT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU MY CARD.

663
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,190
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME TOMORROW.

664
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:34,359
I'M SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

665
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,788
I'M BLOWN AWAY.
I MEAN, THIS IS...

666
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:37,770
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

667
00:33:37,771 --> 00:33:39,635
WHY, THAT'S VERY EUROPEAN OF YOU.
THANK YOU.

668
00:33:39,636 --> 00:33:42,636
IS THIS, LIKE,
AN EAST INDIAN THING OR...

669
00:33:42,642 --> 00:33:44,382
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T
KNOW FROM WHENCE IT COMES.

670
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:45,878
I'LL MEET YOU BY THE CAR, OKAY?

671
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:47,481
- HEY...
- NICE MEETING YOU.

672
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,788
IT WAS WONDERFUL MEETING YOU.

673
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:51,424
SHE'S WONDERFUL.

674
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:52,594
YOU KNOW, JANA IS
GONNA TAKE ME HOME,

675
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:53,895
SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

676
00:33:53,897 --> 00:33:55,667
IS EVERYTHING COOL?

677
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:57,768
<i>LET'S TALK ABOUT IT LATER, OKAY?</i>

678
00:33:57,772 --> 00:33:59,612
ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE.

679
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:04,618
SO, WHAT'S AN AGENT DO?

680
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:05,889
Jerry: <i>OH, HOW CAN
YOU EAT THAT CRAP?</i>

681
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,857
- <i>IT'S SO BAD FOR YOU.</i>
- RIGHT.

682
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:10,928
THIS FROM A MAN
WHO SHOT UP BLACK TAR

683
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:13,801
- SMUGGLED ACROSS THE BORDER IN PEOPLE'S ASSES.
- YEAH.

684
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:16,274
WELL, AT LEAST THERE'S NO MSG.

685
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:20,475
SO, YOU GET THIS AGENT,
AND THEN WHAT?

686
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:23,556
GET A GREAT GIG, HUGE ADVANCE,

687
00:34:23,557 --> 00:34:25,325
BLOW ALL OF IT ON DOPE,

688
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:27,356
AND COP A HABIT
THE SIZE OF UTAH.

689
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:33,408
- OH, GOD.
- HEY!

690
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:35,379
DON'T YOU KNOCK, HUH?

691
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,980
I'M TRYING TO GET DRESSED HERE.

692
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:38,323
- CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE?
- YEAH.

693
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:39,688
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS.

694
00:34:39,689 --> 00:34:41,759
IT'S JUST BEEN CRAZY LATELY,

695
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,798
YOU KNOW, WITH THE SHOW
AND THE PLAY,

696
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:46,799
WITH NICKY, AND,
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST...

697
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:48,539
THIS IS SO WEIRD.

698
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,409
IT'S, LIKE, A WHOLE, YOU
KNOW, NEW THING FOR ME,

699
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,950
<i>MAKING MORE MONEY THAN MY DAD.</i>

700
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:54,685
- JERRY, CRAIG IS FIRING YOU.
- WHAT?

701
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:57,256
HE'S GETTING RID
OF YOU TOMORROW.

702
00:34:57,257 --> 00:34:58,626
THAT'S IMP...

703
00:34:58,627 --> 00:35:01,567
I SAVED HIS ASS LAST MONTH.
THAT'S BULLSHIT.

704
00:35:01,568 --> 00:35:02,734
HE LIKES YOU.

705
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:04,665
HE JUST CAN'T WORK
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

706
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:06,682
YOU'RE ALWAYS LATE,
YOU'RE ERRATIC,

707
00:35:06,683 --> 00:35:08,776
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS HIGH.

708
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,215
DID HE SAY THAT?

709
00:35:10,216 --> 00:35:12,286
DID HE SAY ERRATIC,
OR IS THAT YOU, LIKE,

710
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:14,287
- PUTTING A LITTLE SPIN ON IT OR SOMETHING, HUH?
- NO.

711
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,461
MY WORDS WOULD BE
VERY DIFFERENT.

712
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:17,969
YEAH? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

713
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:21,304
WHAT ARE YOUR WORDS?
WHAT WOULD YOUR WORDS BE, HUH?

714
00:35:21,305 --> 00:35:23,835
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE SO
FULL OF SELF-HATRED

715
00:35:23,844 --> 00:35:25,482
THAT YOU CANNOT CONTAIN IT,

716
00:35:25,483 --> 00:35:27,790
SO ALL YOU DO IS JUST SHOOT
IT BACK INTO YOUR VEINS

717
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,855
AND LET IT SPILL OUT
ONTO EVERYBODY ELSE.

718
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:33,758
THAT'S REALLY POETIC.
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

719
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,767
CAN I USE THAT SOMETIME?

720
00:35:35,768 --> 00:35:38,468
YEAH, IF YOU'RE EVER IN A FIT-ENOUGH
STATE TO WRITE ANOTHER LINE.

721
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:43,322
OK. COULD I HAVE, LIKE,
TWO SECONDS HERE TO...

722
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:49,357
THERE'S A PARTY GOING ON
OUT HERE, YOU KNOW?

723
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:55,910
IT'S A REALLY COOL PLAY.

724
00:35:55,911 --> 00:35:57,548
JERRY WROTE IT THREE YEARS AGO,

725
00:35:57,549 --> 00:36:00,875
BUT IT'S 50% AVANT POP...

726
00:36:00,884 --> 00:36:03,764
IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE
BECAUSE IT'S 50% AVANT POP,

727
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:08,866
50% SAM SHEPARD
MEETS ARTHUR C. CLARKE.

728
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,837
WE SPOON-FED IT TO HIM,
AND NOW I HEAR

729
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:13,438
HE'S GOING ALL AROUND TOWN
PITCHING OUR IDEA

730
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:15,011
BACK TO ALL THE NETWORKS.

731
00:36:15,012 --> 00:36:16,682
I MEAN, HOW COULD HE DO THAT?

732
00:36:16,683 --> 00:36:18,686
THAT GUY IS SLIME.

733
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:20,055
I MEAN, HE ACTUALLY HAS HIS SECRETARIES
WRITE HIS SCRIPTS FOR HIM.

734
00:36:20,056 --> 00:36:21,625
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

735
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:22,896
TO COME TO THESE PARTIES, RIGHT,

736
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:24,895
AND EVERYBODY
IS TALKING ABOUT WORK.

737
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:27,569
WHAT, THEY DON'T
HAVE A FUCKING LIFE, YOU KNOW?

738
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:30,441
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT I HAVE
A REALLY RICH CIVILIAN LIFE.

739
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:32,383
I'D LIKE TO THINK
YOU DO, TOO, YOU KNOW?

740
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,784
MOST DEFINITELY, YEAH.

741
00:36:34,785 --> 00:36:37,685
SO, TELL ME,
WHAT ARE YOUR PASSIONS?

742
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:40,630
MY PASSIONS?

743
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,031
EVERYTHING I DO.

744
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,669
- EVERYTHING?
- YEAH.

745
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,910
HEY, WOULD YOU
EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND?

746
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,875
NO. I WON'T. I WON'T.

747
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:49,346
YOU BLEW ME OFF FOR DINNER. YOU
DON'T CALL ME. I GAVE YOU MY CARD.

748
00:36:49,347 --> 00:36:51,707
YOU'RE NOW OBLIGATED TO STAND
HERE AND GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES.

749
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,927
YOU'RE COMING BACK, RIGHT?

750
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:59,734
10% NAKED GIRLS...
JERRY, OF COURSE.

751
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:01,635
JERRY, JERRY, JERRY, JERRY,
TELL HER HOW GREAT THE PLAY IS.

752
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,639
IT'S GREAT.

753
00:37:03,643 --> 00:37:05,453
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR IMPROV GROUP
THAT YOU'RE IN.

754
00:37:05,454 --> 00:37:07,076
WHAT IS THAT LIKE?

755
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,040
SO, HAVE YOU MET JERRY YET?

756
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:22,512
- NO. IS HE HERE?
- OH, YES, YES.

757
00:37:22,514 --> 00:37:24,818
HE'S HERE, BUT HE'S REALLY SHY.

758
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:27,259
HE'S PROBABLY SORT OF, YOU KNOW,
HIDING IN A CORNER SOMEWHERE.

759
00:37:38,145 --> 00:37:39,975
BUSY.

760
00:37:39,982 --> 00:37:42,452
Mr. Chompers: <i>HEY, JERRY,
LET ME IN, WILL YOU?</i>

761
00:37:42,453 --> 00:37:44,524
<i>COME ON. OPEN THE DOOR.</i>

762
00:37:44,525 --> 00:37:48,825
- MR. CHOMPERS.
- <i>DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE. COME ON.</i>

763
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:52,105
<i>NOBODY COULD WRITE THE SHIT
YOU WRITE STRAIGHT.</i>

764
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:55,876
<i>YOU OWE ME A TASTE.</i>

765
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:58,951
<i>DAMN IT! LET ME IN!
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.</i>

766
00:37:58,953 --> 00:38:01,633
<i>NO WONDER YOU DON'T
WRITE FOR ME ANYMORE.</i>

767
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:05,426
<i>YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE BASICS OF COMEDY...</i>

768
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:07,804
- FUCKING JUNKIE.
- AAH! NO!

769
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:09,105
GET THE...

770
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:11,007
AAH!

771
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:14,918
DAMN IT, LET ME IN, YOU...

772
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:18,589
AAH! AAH!

773
00:38:18,593 --> 00:38:20,128
GAAH! GAAH!

774
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,038
WHAT WAS THAT SOUND,

775
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,079
THE ONE THAT WE CAME
UP WITH THE OTHER DAY,

776
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,476
THAT GREAT SOUND?

777
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:32,119
IT WAS LIKE DOOT,
DOOT, YOU KNOW?

778
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:42,172
IT WASN'T THAT. I DON'T KNOW.

779
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:43,942
Jana: <i>IT'S AN AMAZING PROJECT.</i>

780
00:38:43,943 --> 00:38:45,846
<i>IT'S VERY SIMILAR
TO "ACE IN THE HOLE,".</i>

781
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:48,147
BUT WHAT IT'S LACKING IS SOMEONE
WITH YOUR KIND OF DARK VISION,

782
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:49,662
AND AT THE END
OF THE DAY, YOU KNOW,

783
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:52,855
THAT'S REALLY ALL
IT NEEDS TO MAKE IT...

784
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:05,819
OR MAYBE YOU COULD JUST
READ THE COVERAGE ON IT.

785
00:39:07,758 --> 00:39:10,058
YEAH.

786
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,710
ARE YOU COMING BACK?

787
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:20,950
BOY, YOU REALLY
PAID YOUR DUES, HUH?

788
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:24,761
YOU EVER BEEN
TO ONE OF THOSE PARTIES?

789
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,128
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

790
00:39:27,129 --> 00:39:30,836
ME AND GEORGE HAMILTON,
MAN, WE'RE LIKE THIS.

791
00:39:30,837 --> 00:39:32,537
WELL, IT WAS GETTING TO THE
POINT WHERE I HAD TO SHOOT

792
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:35,779
SIX BAGS TO TURN ON THE
FUCKING TYPEWRITER.

793
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,620
<i>BY THIS POINT, DITA COULDN'T
KEEP UP WITH MY HABIT,</i>

794
00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:44,774
<i>SO SOME DAYS,
I HAD TO IMPROVISE.</i>

795
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:51,006
Tom Waits: <i>♪ HE ROLLED A BLADE
UP IN HIS TRICK TOWEL ♪</i>

796
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:55,118
<i>♪ THEY SLAP THEIR HANDS
AGAINST THE WALL ♪</i>

797
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,026
<i>♪ YOU NEVER TRIP,
YOU NEVER STUMBLE ♪</i>

798
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:02,867
<i>♪ HE'S WALKING SPANISH
DOWN THE HALL ♪</i>

799
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:04,708
<i>AGH!</i>

800
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:10,946
<i>♪ OR GIVE HIM A SPOON
TO DIG A HOLE ♪</i>

801
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,089
<i>♪ WHAT ALL HE DONE
AIN'T NO ONE'S BUSINESS ♪</i>

802
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,590
JEEZ, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

803
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:18,203
NOTHING. I JUST
SLIPPED AT THE GYM.

804
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:33,661
IT'S NOT THERE, JERRY.

805
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,865
WELL, WHERE IT IS?

806
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:38,169
I THREW IT AWAY.

807
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:40,976
OH, WHY'D YOU DO THAT, HUH?

808
00:40:40,977 --> 00:40:43,747
JERRY, I CAN'T STAND BY AND
WATCH YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF.

809
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,690
YES, YOU CAN.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

810
00:40:45,691 --> 00:40:49,827
THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE.

811
00:40:49,828 --> 00:40:52,666
LISTEN. I'M SORRY.

812
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,067
HONEY, I KNOW THIS LOOKS BAD,

813
00:40:55,072 --> 00:40:56,410
BUT REALLY, IT'S WORSE
THAN IT SEEMS.

814
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:57,838
I KNOW, IT'S GETTING
A LITTLE CRAZY, RIGHT?

815
00:40:57,844 --> 00:40:59,184
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,

816
00:40:59,185 --> 00:41:01,885
BUT IT'S REALLY GONNA BE FINE.

817
00:41:01,886 --> 00:41:04,824
I JUST NEED TO QUIT

818
00:41:04,825 --> 00:41:06,725
ON MY OWN SCHEDULE,
AND I'M GONNA QUIT.

819
00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:08,999
JERRY, I CAN GET YOU
A JOB ON "NO SUCH LUCK."

820
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,270
I KNOW THE PRODUCERS.

821
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:11,969
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT SHOW.

822
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:14,982
IT'LL BE GREAT FOR YOU TO DO IT.

823
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:23,194
I COULD DO THAT. IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT, REALLY?

824
00:41:23,195 --> 00:41:26,895
I JUST WANT US TO BE HAPPY.

825
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:30,876
I WANT US TO BE HAPPY.
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

826
00:41:30,877 --> 00:41:33,047
YOU ARE SUCH A PRIORITY
FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

827
00:41:33,048 --> 00:41:34,717
I MEAN, I KNOW
THIS SOUNDS WEIRD,

828
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:36,788
BUT I'VE NEVER HAD A
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEBODY...

829
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:38,229
DO YOU WANT TO DO IT?

830
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,025
YEAH. I THINK I SHOULD.

831
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:44,668
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, IT
SEEMS LIKE A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

832
00:41:59,835 --> 00:42:02,805
I'M GONNA CALL SOME REHAB
PLACES TOMORROW, OKAY?

833
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:05,177
OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

834
00:42:05,178 --> 00:42:07,816
THANK YOU.

835
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,917
I SWEAR, THIS IS JUST LIKE GAS

836
00:42:10,924 --> 00:42:13,334
TO GET ME TO
THE HOSPITAL, YOU KNOW?

837
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:15,968
I LOVE YOU.

838
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:31,061
SANDRA SAID A LOT OF
GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOU.

839
00:42:31,064 --> 00:42:34,244
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I READ
SOME OF YOUR "CHOMPERS" STUFF.

840
00:42:34,245 --> 00:42:36,736
YOU CAN WRITE,
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT,

841
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:41,016
BUT WE'RE NOT DOING
A PUPPET SHOW HERE.

842
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,417
I THOUGHT WE WERE
DOING A PUPPET SHOW.

843
00:42:42,419 --> 00:42:46,389
NO. IT'S NOT A PUPPET SHOW.

844
00:42:46,394 --> 00:42:48,364
- GARY...
- <i>HEY, DARLING.</i>

845
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,265
HI.

846
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,338
HELLO.

847
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:54,439
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HAD A
CHANCE TO READ THE SCRIPT,

848
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:57,051
JERRY, BUT PAMELA HERE
HAS A COUPLE OF IDEAS

849
00:42:57,052 --> 00:42:58,319
<i>ON WHERE WE SHOULD TAKE IT.</i>

850
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,118
WELL, I HATE MY CHARACTER.

851
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:02,826
I MEAN, IT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO SAY THAT I'M AN ATTORNEY

852
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:04,396
OR A JUDGE OR WHATEVER
AND THEN JUST WRITE ME

853
00:43:04,397 --> 00:43:07,135
AS THE TYPICAL
LOVE-STARVED SINGLE WOMAN

854
00:43:07,136 --> 00:43:09,876
WHO GETS WET EVERY TIME SOMEBODY
ASKS HER OUT FOR DINNER.

855
00:43:09,877 --> 00:43:12,875
HA HA HA! UH, ABSOLUTELY.

856
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:18,190
THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD,
HAPPY ACCIDENT.

857
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:21,731
MY FATHER WAS A FEDERAL APPEALS
COURT JUDGE FOR 20 YEARS,

858
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,804
SO I KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT...

859
00:43:24,805 --> 00:43:28,235
THE CASE THAT HE PUTS
THE GAVEL IN,

860
00:43:28,244 --> 00:43:32,519
THIS LITTLE LEATHER,
BLUE-AND-WHITE, STITCHED THING;

861
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,260
YOU KNOW,
HOW HE CLEANS THE ROBES;

862
00:43:37,262 --> 00:43:39,372
WHAT HE WEARS UNDERNEATH,
ALL RIGHT,

863
00:43:39,373 --> 00:43:41,336
<i>GETTING INTO THAT WHOLE AREA.</i>

864
00:43:41,337 --> 00:43:42,867
<i>BUT, YOU KNOW, STUFF LIKE THAT,</i>

865
00:43:42,874 --> 00:43:45,084
THE LITTLE MINUTIAE,
WHICH IS REALLY

866
00:43:45,085 --> 00:43:48,016
WHAT GIVES IT, YOU KNOW,
THE LIFE TO IT.

867
00:43:48,017 --> 00:43:49,447
THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S GREAT.

868
00:43:49,453 --> 00:43:51,189
THAT'S GREAT THAT YOU CAN BRING

869
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,530
YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE
TO THIS THING.

870
00:43:52,531 --> 00:43:55,097
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S HOW I WORK.

871
00:43:55,098 --> 00:43:57,098
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW,
HOPEFULLY, EVERYBODY...

872
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:58,342
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
THE CREATIVE PROCESS, REALLY.

873
00:43:58,343 --> 00:44:00,808
YOU'RE JUST KIND OF...

874
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,579
HAVE YOU SEEN THE SHOW?

875
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,819
HAVE I SEEN THE SHOW? IT'S
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL STUFF.

876
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,896
WHAT YOU GUYS DO
WITH THE SHOW IS...

877
00:44:10,897 --> 00:44:15,907
I DON'T WANT TO SAY ART
BECAUSE THAT GETS...

878
00:44:16,942 --> 00:44:19,212
BUT KIND OF.

879
00:44:19,213 --> 00:44:21,853
YOU KNOW, I'D BRING WHATEVER
I CAN BRING TO THE TABLE.

880
00:44:21,854 --> 00:44:23,859
HOPEFULLY, IT'S HELPFUL
STUFF, YOU KNOW?

881
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,326
THAT'S ALL I DO, SCOTT,
IS JUST...

882
00:44:25,327 --> 00:44:28,525
NO, NO, NO. GARY.

883
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:31,102
- JERRY.
- GARY.

884
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:35,579
I'M... YOU'RE GARY.
I KNOW YOU'RE GARY.

885
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,549
JERRY, I GOT TO MAKE
A COUPLE OF CALLS.

886
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,020
THANKS FOR COMING IN, HUH?

887
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:41,421
HEY, MAN, YOU DO YOUR THING.

888
00:44:41,424 --> 00:44:45,866
I'M A FLY ON THE WALL.

889
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:48,467
I HAVE TO MAKE
THE CALLS RIGHT NOW.

890
00:44:56,087 --> 00:44:58,457
MAKE THE CALLS RIGHT NOW.
ALL RIGHT.

891
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,258
YOU BE GOOD.

892
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:02,031
TAKE CARE, MAN.

893
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,135
- PAMELA...
- OKAY, JERRY.

894
00:45:04,136 --> 00:45:06,576
- THANKS FOR COMING IN, HUH?
- OKAY.

895
00:45:07,877 --> 00:45:12,417
MIND IF I... INDULGE?

896
00:45:17,462 --> 00:45:19,934
JERRY...

897
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:22,135
YOU'RE EASY TO SPOT
FROM A DISTANCE.

898
00:45:23,474 --> 00:45:25,884
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN MY SHOW.

899
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:30,120
HEY, I'M SORRY ABOUT IN THERE.

900
00:45:30,121 --> 00:45:33,060
YOU KNOW, I WAS ALL...
I THINK I GOT NERVOUS.

901
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:35,497
BULLSHIT.

902
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:38,638
I BET $50 I'D FIND TRACK
MARKS BETWEEN YOUR TOES.

903
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:42,879
LOOK. I SAID I WAS SORRY, SO...

904
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,284
DON'T BE SORRY,
IT'S A SHITTY SHOW.

905
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:47,285
BUT THEY'RE PAYING ME AN
OBSCENE AMOUNT OF MONEY,

906
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:49,258
WHICH I NEED BECAUSE EVERYTHING
I MADE WHEN I WAS YOUNG,

907
00:45:49,259 --> 00:45:52,129
I EITHER DRANK AWAY, SNORTED UP
MY NOSE, OR DROVE IN THE POOL.

908
00:45:53,201 --> 00:45:55,104
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

909
00:45:55,105 --> 00:45:59,305
LOOK. I WANT YOU TO
WRITE FOR MY SHOW...

910
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,420
IF YOU CAN GET CLEAN.

911
00:46:05,025 --> 00:46:09,995
OKAY, BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT GARY?

912
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,371
OH, PLEASE.

913
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:19,046
IF YOU FUCK UP, YOU WON'T EXIST.

914
00:46:19,053 --> 00:46:20,423
Man:
<i>ANY ALLERGIES TO MEDICATION?</i>

915
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:21,891
Jerry: <i>NO.</i>

916
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:23,292
<i>TAKING ANY PRESCRIPTIONS DRUGS?</i>

917
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:24,328
NOPE.

918
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:26,667
THINK YOU CAN KICK?

919
00:46:26,668 --> 00:46:28,098
EXCUSE ME?

920
00:46:28,104 --> 00:46:29,612
METHADONE WILL GET
RID OF THE SHAKES,

921
00:46:29,613 --> 00:46:31,547
BUT YOU'RE BASICALLY TRADING
ONE HABIT FOR ANOTHER

922
00:46:31,548 --> 00:46:33,005
WHEN YOU WANT TO QUIT.

923
00:46:33,014 --> 00:46:34,415
IT'S UP TO YOU.

924
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:37,316
WELL, THAT'S VERY INFORMATIVE.
THANK YOU.

925
00:46:37,322 --> 00:46:39,292
HOW LONG YOU BEEN USING?

926
00:46:39,293 --> 00:46:41,697
A COUPLE YEARS.

927
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:44,235
YOU WON'T MAKE IT. IT'S A CYCLE.

<i>SHOW UP HERE ONCE A WEEK

932
00:46:54,423 --> 00:46:57,629
- <i>ANY QUESTIONS?</i>
- PISS IN A CUP?

933
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,499
YOU DON'T SOUND VERY OPTIMISTIC.

934
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,970
YOU WANT OPTIMISTIC?
SOME PEOPLE MAKE IT.

935
00:47:02,974 --> 00:47:04,910
SOME PEOPLE END UP DEAD.

936
00:47:04,911 --> 00:47:07,321
GOOD LUCK.

937
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,401

00:50:50,996 --> 00:50:52,596
THAT IT'S GONNA GET OLD
BEFORE THE SEASON'S OVER.

1009
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,769
NO, NO, NO. PAM.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1010
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,974
GUY HATES ME, RIGHT?

1011
00:50:56,975 --> 00:50:58,575
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,

1012
00:50:58,578 --> 00:51:00,278
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN "NOSFERATU"?

1013
00:51:00,281 --> 00:51:01,950
OR, LIKE, FRITZ LANG'S "M"?

1014
00:51:01,951 --> 00:51:04,621
<i>OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
HOW ABOUT, LIKE.</i>

1015
00:51:04,624 --> 00:51:05,893
"THE PATTY DUKE SHOW"?

1016
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:07,294
THE FIRST TIME I SAW THAT THING,

1017
00:51:07,295 --> 00:51:08,425
IT GAVE ME NIGHTMARES
FOR THREE NIGHTS.

1018
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,240
THE POINT IS, REALISM...

1019
00:51:18,918 --> 00:51:20,618
IS DEAD.

1020
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:21,760
EXPRESSIONISM IS WHERE IT'S AT,

1021
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:22,828
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

1022
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:25,696
I DON'T KNOW.

1023
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:27,399
I'M JUST A PRODUCT
OF PUBLIC EDUCATION.

1024
00:51:27,402 --> 00:51:28,742
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1025
00:51:28,743 --> 00:51:30,838
NO. I THINK WHAT JERRY'S
TRYING TO SAY IS

1026
00:51:30,842 --> 00:51:34,516
HE WANTS TO EXPRESS
THE EMOTIONS EXTERNALLY,

1027
00:51:34,517 --> 00:51:36,247
YOU KNOW, LIKE
IN A SET, IN MUSIC...

1028
00:51:36,253 --> 00:51:38,022
MUSIC, MUSIC, MUSIC.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

1029
00:51:38,023 --> 00:51:41,763
I'M TALKING ABOUT... WHY CAN'T
PAMELA JUST WALK IN ONE DAY,

1030
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:43,534
BELT IT OUT AND SING IT.

1031
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:45,604
JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHOW,
FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER.

1032
00:51:45,605 --> 00:51:47,035
WE'RE TALKING IT'S YOU AND BERT,
YOU AND BERT, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

1033
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:48,811
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
BOOM, SHE POPS OUT,

1034
00:51:48,812 --> 00:51:50,648
AND SHE STARTS SINGING, OKAY?

1035
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,949
I DON'T KNOW WHAT. SHE'S
DOING, LIKE, ETHEL MERMAN,

1036
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:52,951
♪ OH, I LOVE A PARADE ♪

1037
00:51:52,953 --> 00:51:54,823
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1038
00:51:54,824 --> 00:51:56,664
YOU TURN AROUND, AND A SWIMMING
POOL OPENS UP BELOW EVERYBODY,

1039
00:51:56,665 --> 00:51:58,630
AND THEN WE GO RIGHT
BACK INTO THE SCENE,

1040
00:51:58,631 --> 00:52:00,031
WE NEVER EVEN MAKE
ANY MENTION OF IT.

1041
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,941
IT'S ALL UNSAID.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

1042
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:04,508
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT SHIT IS?
THAT'S HOT.

1043
00:52:07,248 --> 00:52:09,518
Kitty: <i>SO NOBODY COULD
TELL YOU WERE FUCKED UP?</i>

1044
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,390
Jerry: <i>OH, NO, I WAS
FIRED IMMEDIATELY.</i>

1045
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,927
Man: AND A BEAR CLAW.

1046
00:52:13,928 --> 00:52:15,628
NO, NO.

1047
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,772
YOU KNOW, WE TOOK THE KIDS
TO DENNY'S LAST NIGHT.

1048
00:52:16,773 --> 00:52:17,837
MY STOMACH FLIPPED.

1049
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:19,536
WAS IT SOMEBODY'S BIRTHDAY?

1050
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,640
Jerry: <i>OF COURSE, I
DIDN'T TELL SANDRA.</i>

1051
00:52:20,642 --> 00:52:21,682
YOU GO THERE ON YOUR BIRTHDAY,

1052
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:22,977
AND THEY GIVE YOU A FREE MEAL.

1053
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,350
Jerry: <i>BUT I WASN'T WORRIED.</i>

1054
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:26,418
<i>I STILL TOOK A LOT OF MEETINGS.</i>

1055
00:52:26,419 --> 00:52:28,659
<i>UNFORTUNATELY
THEY WERE ALL WITH GUS.</i>

1056
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,897
EXCUSE ME. DID I SUMMON YOU?

1057
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:34,067
DID I ASK YOU TO COME OVER HERE?

1058
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:35,604
<i>JUST DOING HER JOB.</i>

1059
00:52:35,605 --> 00:52:36,935
I'M TRYING TO DO MY JOB.

1060
00:52:36,941 --> 00:52:38,911
THIS IS WHERE I DO BUSINESS.

1061
00:52:38,912 --> 00:52:40,781
WELL, SHE'S DOING HER BUSINESS
'CAUSE SHE'S A WAITRESS.

1062
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:41,982
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

1063
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:43,523
WHY DON'T YOU MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

1064
00:52:43,524 --> 00:52:45,321
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

1065
00:52:45,324 --> 00:52:46,358
NYEH NYEH NYEH.

1066
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:49,529
HA HA! LOOK WHAT I GOT YOU.

1067
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:50,868
WHAT'S THAT?

1068
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:52,369
DILAUDID.

1069
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:54,041
I DON'T WANT IT.

1070
00:52:54,042 --> 00:52:55,882
<i>PUT IT AWAY. MIGHT BE UNDERCOVER IN HERE.
PUT IT AWAY.</i>

1071
00:52:55,883 --> 00:52:57,379
WELL, YOU JUST
PUT IT ON THE TABLE.

1072
00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:58,591
I PUT IT BY THE SUGAR.

1073
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,745
ALL RIGHT.

1074
00:52:59,753 --> 00:53:00,963
PUT IT AWAY. YOU CAN AFFORD IT.

1075
00:53:00,964 --> 00:53:02,556
YOU'RE WRITING FOR THAT MARTIAN.

1076
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,759
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

1077
00:53:03,761 --> 00:53:07,969
- WASN'T FROM MARS.
- WHATEVER.

1078
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,710
TASTE MY MOUTH.

1079
00:53:12,478 --> 00:53:14,047
WHO LOVES YOU, JERRY?

1080
00:53:14,048 --> 00:53:15,448
YOU DO, GUS.

1081
00:53:15,451 --> 00:53:17,491
NO, I CAN'T STAND YOU.
TELLY SAVALAS.

1082
00:53:17,492 --> 00:53:18,724
HA HA HA!

1083
00:53:18,725 --> 00:53:20,355
<i>YOU DON'T GET IT.</i>

1084
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:22,364
"WHO LOVES YOU, BABY?"

1085
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,895
HA HA!

1086
00:53:44,576 --> 00:53:47,915
YOU KNOW WE HAVE WAY
TOO MUCH IN COMMON.

1087
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:51,086
THIS IS NEVER GONNA WORK.

1088
00:53:57,134 --> 00:54:01,914
TRUST ME, IT'S BETTER IN A
MOTEL THAN IN A MARRIAGE.

1089
00:54:06,654 --> 00:54:07,822
HEY.

1090
00:54:07,823 --> 00:54:09,692
HI.

1091
00:54:09,693 --> 00:54:10,894
YOU SICK?

1092
00:54:10,895 --> 00:54:12,025
<i>NO.</i>

1093
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:13,631
WHY AREN'T YOU AT WORK?

1094
00:54:13,634 --> 00:54:16,044
DID YOU GET FIRED
FOR BEING TOO ERRATIC?

1095
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:18,476
YOU SEEM HAPPY?

1096
00:54:18,477 --> 00:54:20,616
YES, I DO HAVE A LITTLE
JAUNT TO MY STEP, DON'T I?

1097
00:54:20,617 --> 00:54:21,975
<i>ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN PROMOTED.</i>

1098
00:54:21,984 --> 00:54:24,922
I'VE BEEN MADE VP
CREATIVE AFFAIRS.

1099
00:54:24,923 --> 00:54:28,563
<i>WOW. VICE PRESIDENT OF
CREATIVE AFFAIRS IS GREAT.</i>

1100
00:54:28,564 --> 00:54:30,567
IT SOUNDS LIKE... WHAT IS THAT?

1101
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:31,638
ARE YOU IN CHARGE OF ADULTERY
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

1102
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:32,937
<i>THAT'S WONDERFUL.</i>

1103
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:35,009
THANK YOU.

1104
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,780
WE SHOULD GO CELEBRATE.

1105
00:54:36,781 --> 00:54:38,817
NO. I MEANT, THANK YOU...

1106
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:40,788
FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.

1107
00:54:40,789 --> 00:54:42,658
I KNOW IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.

1108
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:46,869
OH... YEAH, WELL...

1109
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,008
I'M PREGNANT.

1110
00:54:51,009 --> 00:54:53,649
WHAT?

1111
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:57,788
I'M PREGNANT.

1112
00:54:57,789 --> 00:55:00,859
I WENT TO CEDARS YESTERDAY
AND THEY CONFIRMED IT.

1113
00:55:18,764 --> 00:55:20,204
JERRY?

1114
00:55:27,516 --> 00:55:29,986
GET OUT!

1115
00:55:29,987 --> 00:55:33,225
I DON'T EVER WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN!

1116
00:55:33,226 --> 00:55:34,856
GO!

1117
00:55:34,863 --> 00:55:36,803
OH, PLEASE!

1118
00:55:38,938 --> 00:55:42,678
OUT! I DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU EVER AGAIN!

1119
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:04,559
YOU HAVE A BABY?

1120
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:09,765
NINA.

1121
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,536
THAT'S A PRETTY NAME.

1122
00:56:11,537 --> 00:56:12,867
MMM...

1123
00:56:14,977 --> 00:56:17,615
DID YOU EVER SEE HER?

1124
00:56:17,616 --> 00:56:21,716
NO. I KINDA GOT IT TOGETHER
TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL

1125
00:56:21,724 --> 00:56:23,094
WHEN SHE WAS BEING BORN, BUT...

1126
00:56:23,095 --> 00:56:24,895
OH!

1127
00:56:24,896 --> 00:56:26,866
<i>WHY SHE WANTED ME THERE,
I'LL NEVER KNOW.</i>

1128
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:29,007
<i>I'D BEEN PRETTY MUCH INTOXICATED
THE WHOLE NINE MONTHS.</i>

1129
00:56:29,008 --> 00:56:30,535
SANDRA.

1130
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:31,941
Woman: <i>FETAL MONITOR.</i>

1131
00:56:31,944 --> 00:56:34,154
I TOLD YOU NOT TO
START THIS WITHOUT ME,

1132
00:56:34,155 --> 00:56:36,218
- <i>DIDN'T I?</i>
- OH!

1133
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:47,739
OKAY, HOLD ON!

1134
00:56:47,742 --> 00:56:49,044
HOW'S SHE DOING?

1135
00:56:49,045 --> 00:56:50,575
Woman: <i>SHE'S ONE MINUTE APART.</i>

1136
00:56:53,186 --> 00:56:54,616
OH!

1137
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:58,028
AH, I CAN FEEL THE BABY'S HEAD.

1138
00:56:58,029 --> 00:57:00,029
IS EVERYTHING OK?

1139
00:57:03,273 --> 00:57:05,242
PUT THIS ON, PLEASE.

1140
00:57:05,243 --> 00:57:08,516
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
SHORT-SLEEVES, THOUGH.

1141
00:57:08,517 --> 00:57:10,247
IT'S REGULATION.

1142
00:57:10,253 --> 00:57:12,123
OKAY, CAN I... CAN I
JUST WEAR MY SHIRT?

1143
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:14,034
I MEAN, THIS IS
VERY CLEAN. IT'S...

1144
00:57:14,035 --> 00:57:16,098
HEY, IT'S YOUR BABY COMING.

1145
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,599
IF I WAS YOU, I'D HURRY.

1146
00:57:20,006 --> 00:57:21,606
FUCK.

1147
00:57:25,685 --> 00:57:26,945
Jerry: <i>HEY.</i>

1148
00:57:26,954 --> 00:57:28,823
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE A BABY GIRL.

1149
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:30,234
OH, GOD, I MISSED IT.

1150
00:57:30,235 --> 00:57:31,827
OH, BABY.

1151
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:33,700
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

1152
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:35,637
HEY... ARE YOU OKAY?

1153
00:57:35,638 --> 00:57:37,238
HMM? ALL RIGHT.

1154
00:57:37,241 --> 00:57:38,941
OH, I MISSED IT. I'M SORRY.

1155
00:57:38,944 --> 00:57:41,354
Doctor: <i>COULD I, UH.
HAVE A WORD WITH YOU?</i>

1156
00:57:41,355 --> 00:57:42,818
- HMM?
- ONE SECOND.

1157
00:57:42,819 --> 00:57:43,949
EXCUSE US.

1158
00:57:47,261 --> 00:57:48,295
BABY ALL RIGHT?

1159
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:49,996
BABY'S FINE.

1160
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:55,614
Kitty: <i>SO WHAT TIME'S YOUR BUS?</i>

1161
00:57:55,615 --> 00:57:57,714
<i>LEAVES IN AN HOUR.</i>

1162
00:57:57,715 --> 00:58:01,755
SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE
BACK IN L. A.?

1163
00:58:01,757 --> 00:58:02,957
NOTHING.

1164
00:58:02,959 --> 00:58:05,259
JUST MY KID.

1165
00:58:05,263 --> 00:58:07,835
DO YOU HAVE A PLACE TO STAY?

1166
00:58:07,836 --> 00:58:10,236
<i>YEAH, THIS CHRISTIAN ROCKER
FROM REHAB NAMED BUDDY.</i>

1167
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,610
<i>HAS GOT A STUDIO IN HOLLYWOOD
HE SAID I COULD CRASH AT.</i>

1168
00:58:14,916 --> 00:58:16,846
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GO BACK?

1169
00:58:16,854 --> 00:58:17,921
UH-UH.

1170
00:58:17,922 --> 00:58:21,962
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, I FIGURE...

1171
00:58:21,964 --> 00:58:26,004
FOR NINA I SHOULD...

1172
00:58:26,005 --> 00:58:28,205
I WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT.

1173
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:29,979
CAN YOU?

1174
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,250
<i>THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.</i>

1175
00:58:33,954 --> 00:58:36,334
YOU WANT TO COME
WITH ME AND FIND OUT?

1176
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:42,771
OKAY.

1177
00:58:42,772 --> 00:58:45,209
WELL, YOU WANT
TO GET BACK IN BED?

1178
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:47,110
JESUS, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

1179
00:58:47,114 --> 00:58:48,853
WHATEVER YOUR PARENTS
DID TO YOU,

1180
00:58:48,854 --> 00:58:51,221

A PAIR OF CAST-IRON BALLS,

I'M PRETTY SURE THAT I
FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

1188
00:59:17,976 --> 00:59:22,176
THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING
TO SAY TO SOMEBODY.

TAKE HER WITH YOU?</i>

1208
01:00:53,934 --> 01:00:56,204

OF COURSE YOU CAN'T
BRING THE BABY IN THERE.

1262
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:51,087
I'M ACTUALLY TRYING
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM.

1263
01:03:51,088 --> 01:03:52,418
HE SAID YOU MIGHT KNOW
WHERE HE'S AT.

IT'S NOT BULLSHIT.
I'M A FRIEND OF HIS.

1267
01:03:58,341 --> 01:04:00,235
HE JUST SAID
IF I WAS LOOKING FOR HIM,

01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:01,739
YOU'D KNOW WHERE HE'S AT,

1269
01:04:01,743 --> 01:04:03,683
'CAUSE WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO GET TOGETHER RIGHT NOW.

1270
01:04:03,684 --> 01:04:05,080
NO, NO, NO. I'M NOT A COP.

I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
A COLLECT CALL FOR STEVE-O

NO, NO, DON'T.

1282
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,170
NO, YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT.

1283
01:05:06,171 --> 01:05:08,174

I KNOW YOU LIKE
DOUBLE CHOCOLATE.

1290
01:05:27,246 --> 01:05:29,046
AAH!

1291
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,350
WHAT?

1292
01:05:30,353 --> 01:05:33,792
THIS IS IT. OKAY? THIS IS IT.

1293
01:05:33,793 --> 01:05:37,332
NOW, DON'T COME
BACK HERE NO MORE, OK?

1294
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,803
'CAUSE I GOT A WARRANT ON MY
ASS!

1295
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,077
Woman, over radio: <i>At 4 a. m.</i>

1296
01:05:42,078 --> 01:05:45,246
<i>Stand up for you rights.</i>

1297
01:05:45,249 --> 01:05:47,249
Man, over radio: <i>Right here on
your personal radio station,</i>

1298
01:05:47,253 --> 01:05:48,287
<i>K. Y. T. A.</i>

1299
01:05:48,288 --> 01:05:50,088
<i>Energy is the source.</i>

1300
01:05:50,092 --> 01:05:52,195
<i>Nothing happens without energy.</i>

1301
01:05:52,196 --> 01:05:54,326
<i>And the more of it you have,</i>

1302
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:57,242
<i>the more of your personal
potential you're gonna tap into.</i>

1303
01:05:57,243 --> 01:06:00,480
<i>But see, energy's like the gas
that drives the car in traffic.</i>

1304
01:06:00,481 --> 01:06:02,318
<i>You don't want to run out
of emotional gas</i>

1305
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,286
<i>when you're climbing
the hill of success.</i>

1306
01:06:04,287 --> 01:06:07,357
<i>Otherwise, you'll find yourself
coasting back downhill.</i>

1307
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,329
<i>And that's what happens
to a lot of people.</i>

1308
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:12,600
<i>How many of you, for example,</i>

1309
01:06:12,604 --> 01:06:14,214
<i>could remember a day when you woke up
feeling really tired and lethargic?</i>

1310
01:06:14,215 --> 01:06:17,107
<i>How many can remember
a day like that?</i>

1311
01:06:17,113 --> 01:06:19,450
<i>For some of you, it was recent.</i>

1312
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:21,861
<i>Now, when you wake up
feeling really tired...</i>

1313
01:06:33,746 --> 01:06:36,685
<i>Not usually the first thought,
is it?</i>

1314
01:06:36,686 --> 01:06:39,456
<i>First thought,
where is the coffee?</i>

1315
01:06:39,457 --> 01:06:41,827
<i>Oh, my God, not another Monday.</i>

1316
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:43,829
<i>You know, when I came here
to New York,</i>

1317
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,536
<i>I got an education.</i>

1318
01:06:45,537 --> 01:06:47,407
<i>I first started coming here
about two years ago.</i>

1319
01:06:47,408 --> 01:06:48,836
<i>I remember about
my third trip in,</i>

1320
01:06:48,843 --> 01:06:51,282
<i>I came on a Wednesday,
you know, mid-week,</i>

1321
01:06:51,283 --> 01:06:53,589
<i>and I'm sitting in the back
of the car here, right,</i>

1322
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:55,356
<i>and I turn on the stereo...</i>

1323
01:06:58,596 --> 01:07:00,926
<i>comes on, he goes, all right,
out there, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1324
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:04,206
<i>we made it! It's hump day!</i>

1325
01:07:05,877 --> 01:07:08,214
<i>You know what hump day is?</i>

1326
01:07:08,215 --> 01:07:10,215
<i>Wednesday. Yeah.</i>

1327
01:07:10,219 --> 01:07:12,759
<i>Some people look at Wednesday
as hump day...</i>

1328
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:19,571
<i>Can you imagine
if large numbers of people</i>

1329
01:07:19,572 --> 01:07:23,852
<i>spend five days out of every seven
looking forward to only two of them?</i>

1330
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:27,716
<i>Some people live for two days
out of every seven.</i>

1331
01:07:27,721 --> 01:07:29,456
<i>Can you imagine living that way?</i>

1332
01:07:29,457 --> 01:07:30,857
<i>Having such a boring,
disgusting life</i>

1333
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:32,260
<i>you look forward
to two out of seven?</i>

1334
01:07:32,263 --> 01:07:34,166
<i>See, the bottom line is,</i>

1335
01:07:34,167 --> 01:07:36,167
<i>My Monday is better than
most people's Christmases</i>

1336
01:07:36,171 --> 01:07:38,679
<i>'cause I've learned how
to communicate with myself...</i>

1337
01:08:13,178 --> 01:08:14,378
CHRIST.

1338
01:08:16,619 --> 01:08:19,657
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU CHANGED THE BABY?

1339
01:08:19,658 --> 01:08:24,298
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW
IT IS, OFFICER...

1340
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,969
KIDS...

1341
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:30,410
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
RIGHT NOW TO GET A DIAPER.

1342
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:34,686
CAN I SEE SOME LICENSE
AND REGISTRATION?

1343
01:08:44,373 --> 01:08:46,778
KEEP IT DOWN.

1344
01:08:46,779 --> 01:08:49,519
WAKE THE KID.

1345
01:09:04,982 --> 01:09:09,492
GET OUT OF THE CAR,
DUMB SHIT. COME ON.

1346
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,639
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE
SOCIAL SERVICES A CALL.

1347
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,506
WE GOT A BABY TO PICK UP.

1348
01:09:17,507 --> 01:09:19,507
STEP TO THE FRONT
OF THE VEHICLE, PLEASE.

1349
01:09:36,545 --> 01:09:38,845
COME ON, WATCH YOUR HEAD.

1350
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:08,091
WHEN YOU VISIT THE SUPERMARKET,

1351
01:11:08,094 --> 01:11:10,434
DO YOU PURCHASE CANNED
DAIRY PRODUCTS EVERY VISIT,

1352
01:11:10,435 --> 01:11:13,102
EVERY OTHER VISIT,
OR ONCE IN A WHILE?

1353
01:11:13,104 --> 01:11:14,543
UH, GOOD EVENING, SIR.

1354
01:11:14,544 --> 01:11:16,611
I'M CALLING FAMILIES LIKE YOURS

1355
01:11:16,612 --> 01:11:18,722
TO ASK A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOUR SHOPPING PRACTICES.

1356
01:11:18,723 --> 01:11:21,986
DO YOU VISIT THE SUPERMARKET
MORE THAN ONCE A WEEK OR LESS?

1357
01:11:46,972 --> 01:11:48,252
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

1358
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:52,481
SANDRA DOESN'T LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT YOU,

1359
01:11:52,483 --> 01:11:55,693
BUT, UH, I KNOW
YOU HAD A BAD RIDE.

1360
01:11:57,727 --> 01:12:01,227
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
THE BEST I'VE HEARD IT PUT.

1361
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:04,773
HUH. AS LONG AS IT'S
COOL WITH SANDRA,

1362
01:12:04,774 --> 01:12:07,554
YOU CAN COME BY AND SEE
NINA ANYTIME YOU WANT.

1363
01:12:07,555 --> 01:12:09,547
I HAVE A KID UP IN MARIN.

1364
01:12:09,551 --> 01:12:11,186
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.

1365
01:12:11,187 --> 01:12:14,225
THANKS.

1366
01:12:14,226 --> 01:12:16,126
HEY, HERE THEY ARE.

1367
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,799
HEY, CAN YOU GET A WIPEY?

1368
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,739
SHE'S GOT SOME INK OR SOMETHING
ON HER FACE.

1369
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,178
- YEAH, SURE.
- THANKS.

1370
01:12:22,179 --> 01:12:24,045
- HEY.
- <i>GIVE ME A MINUTE, OKAY?</i>

1371
01:12:24,046 --> 01:12:25,176
LET ME GET HER CLEANED UP.

1372
01:12:25,182 --> 01:12:26,622
SHE'S A BIT OF A MESS.

1373
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:29,788
SHE'S NOT A MESS.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

1374
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:32,228
SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL MESS.

1375
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:35,069
SHE'S GETTING INTO
EVERYTHING AT THE MOMENT.

1376
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:36,768
CAN I HOLD HER?

1377
01:12:36,772 --> 01:12:38,741
YEAH, SURE.

1378
01:12:38,742 --> 01:12:42,749
HERE. IT'S OKAY.
GOOD GIRL. GOOD GIRL.

1379
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,290
HEY, SWEETIE, HI.

1380
01:12:49,029 --> 01:12:50,629
HOW ARE YOU?

1381
01:12:50,633 --> 01:12:52,703
MARVELOUS.

1382
01:12:52,704 --> 01:12:54,707
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

1383
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:57,578
I FEEL LIKE AN ALIEN.

1384
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:01,920
NEVER SEEN L. A.
STRAIGHT BEFORE.

1385
01:13:01,922 --> 01:13:04,927
HEY, SHE LIKES YOU.
DOESN'T GO TO ANYBODY.

1386
01:13:04,928 --> 01:13:06,128
LOOK AT THAT, SANDRA.

1387
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:08,200
IT'S SWEET.

1388
01:13:10,138 --> 01:13:12,178
YOU KNOW, JERRY, I'VE GOT TO GO.

1389
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:20,224
GOOD GIRL.

1390
01:13:20,225 --> 01:13:23,225
GOOD GIRL. GOOD GIRL.

1391
01:13:23,231 --> 01:13:25,835
CAN I SEE HER TOMORROW?

1392
01:13:25,836 --> 01:13:28,675
WELL, I'M HAVING
THIS BRUNCH HERE TOMORROW.

1393
01:13:28,676 --> 01:13:30,645
IT'S GONNA BE
PRETTY HECTIC, YOU KNOW?

1394
01:13:30,646 --> 01:13:32,276
ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT MONDAY?

1395
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:34,822
DAYTIME'S BAD. IT'LL HAVE
TO BE IN THE EVENING.

1396
01:13:34,823 --> 01:13:36,191
ALL RIGHT. I WAS KIND OF HOPING

1397
01:13:36,192 --> 01:13:37,890
WE COULD MAKE THIS
A REGULAR THING.

1398
01:13:37,894 --> 01:13:40,799
DON'T MAKE IT DIFFICULT,
JERRY, OKAY?

1399
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,337
YOU'RE ON A THIN STRING ALREADY.

1400
01:13:43,338 --> 01:13:47,248
OKAY. FINE.

1401
01:13:50,118 --> 01:13:51,858
HMM...

1402
01:14:01,675 --> 01:14:03,205
BUDDY?

1403
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,590
HELLO?

1404
01:14:19,109 --> 01:14:21,614
HI.

1405
01:14:21,615 --> 01:14:25,254
YOU WRITE ME A LOVE
LETTER OR SOMETHING?

1406
01:14:25,255 --> 01:14:28,725
MY GOD.

1407
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:32,869
CAN I COME IN?

1408
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:34,710
YEAH.

1409
01:14:37,814 --> 01:14:40,250
WOW.

1410
01:14:40,251 --> 01:14:42,889
YEAH, IT'S, UM...

1411
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:46,129
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

1412
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:49,135
OH. IT'S VERY COMPLICATED.

1413
01:14:49,136 --> 01:14:52,636
I CALLED VOLA, AND SHE
GAVE ME YOUR ADDRESS.

1414
01:15:13,719 --> 01:15:15,859
I MISSED YOU.

1415
01:15:19,731 --> 01:15:21,231
NO.

1416
01:15:21,233 --> 01:15:22,403
I DIDN'T COME HERE

1417
01:15:22,404 --> 01:15:25,012
TO SPEND ALL MY TIME
IN BED WITH YOU.

1418
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:14,105
HEY.

1419
01:16:14,106 --> 01:16:16,206
HEY.

1420
01:16:17,713 --> 01:16:20,323
I READ THE ARTICLE YOU WROTE.

1421
01:16:23,925 --> 01:16:25,455
AND, UH, WHAT DID YOU THINK?

1422
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:26,930
IT WAS GOOD.

1423
01:16:26,931 --> 01:16:28,801
SOUNDED LIKE YOU.

1424
01:16:28,802 --> 01:16:31,072
PROVED YOU WERE REAL.

1425
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:34,078
SOMETHING THAT YOU NEEDED?

1426
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:36,819
I GUESS SO, YEAH.

1427
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:44,298
YOU HAVE SUGAR?

1428
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,039
YEAH.

1429
01:16:48,174 --> 01:16:50,010
THANKS.

1430
01:16:50,011 --> 01:16:53,051
SO, UH, WHEN DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING BACK?

1431
01:16:56,056 --> 01:16:59,356
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT GOING BACK.

1432
01:17:05,976 --> 01:17:07,906
I'M MOVING TO ANCHORAGE.

1433
01:17:09,717 --> 01:17:13,317
MY BROTHER OWNS
A HATCHERY UP THERE,

1434
01:17:13,324 --> 01:17:15,393
AND HE'S GONNA OPEN UP
A BREW PUB,

1435
01:17:15,394 --> 01:17:17,334
AND HE ASKED ME
TO RUN IT FOR HIM.

1436
01:17:17,335 --> 01:17:20,002
WOW.

1437
01:17:20,004 --> 01:17:22,344
WOW. THAT'S TERRIFIC.

1438
01:17:23,812 --> 01:17:25,312
A BREW PUB, HUH?

1439
01:17:26,483 --> 01:17:28,222
IMAGINE ME BEHIND THE BAR,

1440
01:17:28,223 --> 01:17:30,490
LIKE WITH A BUNCH OF DRUNKEN
FISHERMEN OR SOMETHING?

1441
01:17:30,491 --> 01:17:33,096
GOSH. YOU HAIR IN PIGTAILS

1442
01:17:33,097 --> 01:17:38,337
AND... PARKA... FROZEN BAIT.

1443
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:40,440
THAT'S GREAT.

1444
01:17:40,444 --> 01:17:42,784
I NEVER BEEN TO ALASKA.

1445
01:17:50,064 --> 01:17:54,104
IT'S SO FUNNY. I, UM...

1446
01:17:54,105 --> 01:17:55,435
WHAT?

1447
01:17:55,441 --> 01:17:59,081
NO, I JUST THINK ABOUT
YOU ALL THE TIME.

1448
01:17:59,082 --> 01:18:01,385
GOING AND PLAYING WITH NINA,

1449
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:04,886
AND, UH, I JUST
KIND OF WONDER WHAT

1450
01:18:04,894 --> 01:18:10,070
YOU'D THINK OF HER.

1451
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:14,445
WHEN I'M ON THE BUS,
LOOK OUT THE WINDOW,

1452
01:18:14,446 --> 01:18:20,386
I KIND OF... WONDER
WHAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT.

1453
01:18:20,391 --> 01:18:23,061
WE GOT UNDER
EACH OTHER'S SKIN, HUH?

1454
01:18:44,941 --> 01:18:48,948
FUCK.

1455
01:18:48,949 --> 01:18:52,859
I'VE BEEN HURT A LOT, YOU KNOW?

1456
01:18:54,225 --> 01:18:57,465
I'VE MADE A LOT OF
REALLY DUMB MISTAKES.

1457
01:19:04,412 --> 01:19:08,092
JERRY STAYS OUT A
LONG TIME THESE DAYS.

1458
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:26,417
- OK?
- OK.

1459
01:19:42,589 --> 01:19:45,359
Kitty:
<i>JERRY, I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE.</i>

1460
01:19:45,361 --> 01:19:48,166
<i>ANOTHER OF OUR FAMOUS GOOD-BYES,</i>

1461
01:19:48,167 --> 01:19:50,367
<i>SO I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT
MY FLIGHT WAS THIS MORNING.</i>

1462
01:19:53,243 --> 01:19:57,250
<i>I'M NOT MUCH GOOD AT THESE
THINGS, SO I'LL JUST STOP.</i>

1463
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:02,995
<i>NO, I CAN GO ON A LITTLE MORE,
I GUESS.</i>

1464
01:20:02,996 --> 01:20:06,096
<i>I WILL MISS YOU.</i>

1465
01:20:06,103 --> 01:20:09,513
<i>AND EVEN THOUGH I KNOW YOU'LL
NEVER SHOW UP IN ANCHORAGE,</i>

1466
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:13,020
<i>I'LL ENTERTAIN THE NOTION
NOW AND THEN.</i>

1467
01:20:14,553 --> 01:20:16,693
<i>SEE YOU LATER.</i>

1468
01:20:30,317 --> 01:20:32,317
Man, over radio:
<i>During the 1980s,</i>

1469
01:20:32,321 --> 01:20:33,761
<i>Jerry Stahl was
a successful television writer</i>

1470
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:36,596
<i>making $5,000 a week.</i>

1471
01:20:36,597 --> 01:20:41,667
<i>At the same time, he also had a $6,000
a week heroin and cocaine habit.</i>

1472
01:20:41,674 --> 01:20:44,213
His dark and funny book is
called "Permanent Midnight."

1473
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:46,451
It's a raw account
of the depths of his habit

1474
01:20:46,452 --> 01:20:48,489
and how he was able
to claw his way out.

1475
01:20:48,490 --> 01:20:50,156
<i>When you got to Hollywood</i>

1476
01:20:50,157 --> 01:20:51,626
and you're working on
these series that I mentioned,

1477
01:20:51,627 --> 01:20:53,257
These were big series.

1478
01:20:53,263 --> 01:20:55,266
What kind of a double life
must you have lead?

1479
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,307
Because you had to at some
level perform as a writer.

1480
01:20:57,308 --> 01:20:59,135
Well, Tom, the beauty
of Hollywood is

1481
01:20:59,142 --> 01:21:01,345
that everybody's
so self-obsessed,

1482
01:21:01,346 --> 01:21:03,316
they don't really notice
what anybody else is doing.

1483
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:06,217
So basically, they come
filing in in the morning

1484
01:21:06,223 --> 01:21:07,992
with their cappuccinos
and croissants,

1485
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:09,703
and I'd come bouncing in
with my heroin and syringes,

1486
01:21:09,704 --> 01:21:12,237
and pretty much lock
myself in the office

1487
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:16,005
and get really pleasant for
about an hour and a half.

1488
01:21:16,009 --> 01:21:18,179
Let's peel away a few
more layers here with Jerry.

1489
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:22,320
Tell us the story as I kind
of teased into this segment

1490
01:21:22,321 --> 01:21:23,624
about the birth of your, uh...

1491
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:24,625
of your child.

1492
01:21:24,627 --> 01:21:25,794
Well, Maury...

1493
01:21:25,795 --> 01:21:27,525
Jerry: <i>PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK.</i>

1494
01:21:27,532 --> 01:21:29,501
<i>WHAT'S THE WORST THING
HEROIN DROVE YOU TO DO.</i>

1495
01:21:29,502 --> 01:21:31,409
<i>I ALWAYS ANSWER
SHOWING UP ON MAURY.</i>

1496
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:34,306
But that's what you do
when you're a junky.

1497
01:21:34,312 --> 01:21:36,052
Your number one job
is to shoot junk.

1498
01:21:36,053 --> 01:21:39,454
I'm sure Damian
will concur with me on this.

1499
01:21:39,455 --> 01:21:40,724
I agree with Jerry

1500
01:21:40,725 --> 01:21:44,225
that the damage is
irre... reprepable.

1501
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:47,170
Jerry: <i>THAT'S THE
TROUBLE WITH SURVIVING.</i>

1502
01:21:47,171 --> 01:21:50,580
<i>AT THE END OF THE DAY, ROLLING
INTO A PTA POTLUCK DINNER.</i>

1503
01:21:50,581 --> 01:21:52,818
<i>OR PAYING THE GAS BILL
CAN BE MORE TERRIFYING.</i>

1504
01:21:52,819 --> 01:21:55,816
<i>THAN THE WORST 3:00 A. M.
NARCOTIC HELL.</i>

1505
01:21:55,822 --> 01:21:57,257
Yep, wow.

1506
01:21:57,258 --> 01:21:58,794
<i>BUT WHAT DO I KNOW?</i>

1507
01:21:58,795 --> 01:22:00,525
<i>I GOT OUT WITH A BAD LIVER
AND ENOUGH DEBT.</i>

1508
01:22:00,532 --> 01:22:02,132
<i>TO KEEP ME IN HOCK
TILL I'M 90...</i>

1509
01:22:02,134 --> 01:22:03,670
<i>IF I'M STILL HERE.</i>

1510
01:22:03,671 --> 01:22:04,811
Jerry Stahl, junkie.

1511
01:22:04,812 --> 01:22:06,576
We'll be right back.

1512
01:22:06,577 --> 01:22:09,617
<i>AND WITH MY LUCK, I WILL BE.</i>

1513
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:20,467
<i>♪ IT CAN COME
FROM OUT OF NOWHERE ♪</i>

1514
01:22:20,471 --> 01:22:23,581
<i>♪ HITS YOU WHEN YOU THINK
