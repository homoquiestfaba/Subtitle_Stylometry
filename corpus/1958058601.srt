Hey!

Get 'em, Coop!

7
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,903
Freeze!

00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,405

Shit, it's a chic.

Congratulations on finally
getting your badge there, Coop.

Or maybe I should
say Detective Cooper?

28
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,379
Yeah, thanks, Bessley.

29
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,650
Sweetie, did you
know about this?

30
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,819
Detective Cooper.

31
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,455
I like the sound
of that, don't you?

32
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,423
Ah, come on, Coop.

33
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,592
I know you hate a party,
but this one's in your honor

34
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,928
so maybe you could just
smile a little bit.

35
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,229
I don't want a party.

36
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,130
Well, you've got one.

37
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,466
So damn it, enjoy it.

38
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,401
How about a nice club soda?

39
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,369
You've earned it.

40
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,004
How about a shot of tequila?

41
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,005
Straight, no chaser.

42
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,077
Come on, Coop.

43
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,378
I thought you were on the wagon.

44
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:08,582
And I thought you
were a bartender.

45
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,185
Come on, Sweetie,
give me a break.

46
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:12,986
OK.

Do I look OK?

50
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,998
You know, uh, back
when I was a cop,

51
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,901
we didn't have any nifty
parties for a promotion.

52
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,103
No?
What'd you get?

53
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,407
Well, they, uh, handcuffed
me to the legs of a pool table.

54
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,642
And then the guys--

55
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,245
[chuckling] they send in
this great big hula dancer.

56
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,346
A hula dancer?

57
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,247
Yeah.

58
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:18,685
And, well, she started to, uh--

59
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,554
why the hell am I
telling you this?

60
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:21,988
I have no idea.

61
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,789
Pour me another, will you?

62
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:33,066
Listen, don't look now,
but here comes Chandler.

63
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,000
Looks like he's got a date.

64
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,038
With her?

65
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:38,838
Not a chance.

66
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,910
Well, Detective Cooper.

67
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,346
Heard you had a little trouble
getting to bed last night.

68
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,347
Buy you a drink, boss?

69
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,348
It's my party.

70
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,050
I heard two cops
on foot patrol

71
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,120
found you passed out in front
of your apartment building.

72
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,655
They had to drag you
upstairs and put you to bed.

73
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,293
Look.

74
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,761
You gonna congratulate
me or chew me out?

75
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,898
That's the Captain's
special way, Coop.

76
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,667
Promote, then pounce.

77
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,202
Cooper, I want you to
meet your new partner,

78
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,704
Detective Block.

79
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,572
Block, Detective Cooper.

80
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,976
EDITH BLOCK: Congratulations,
Detective Cooper.

81
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,410
Um-- call me Coop.

82
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,212
Everybody does.

83
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,315
Block just transferred
from San Francisco.

84
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,283
Well.

85
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,184
Have a seat, Block.

86
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,652
Let me buy you a drink.

87
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,487
I don't drink.

88
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,555
Oh, uh.

89
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,258
Well, uh, Sweetie
serves a mean club soda.

90
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,059
Orange juice
please, bartender.

91
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,061
You got it.

92
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,862
And then there's this.

93
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,634
[sighs] I know.

94
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,202
Eight street kids

96
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:52,746
Towards you?

97
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,687
I want you and Block
to go undercover on this.

98
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,689
You know Lieutenant Russo?

99
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,759
Russo-- the fat guy
with hair on his back?

100
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,726
Hardly.

101
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,061
He's your go-between
with Homicide.

102
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,763
He has the case summary.

103
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,132
He's at your disposal.

104
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,167
I'm also sending you a
tech expert from downtown

105
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,536
in a couple of days.

106
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,672
Tech expert?

107
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,206
What are we, secret agents?

108
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,808
Stop whining.

109
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,577
You're going to need all
the help you can get.

110
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,146
Look, I've got to run.

111
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,714
Congratulations.

112
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,649
Captain, you're
leaving so soon?

113
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,251
We didn't even get
a chance to dance.

114
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,185

00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,425
Well, looks like
it's you and me, Block.

117
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,060
It looks that way.

118
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,631
Sweetie, give us another
round and I'll quit forever.

119
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,565
Last one, Coop.

120
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,807
So do you have a first name?

121
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,008
Edith.

122
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,876
It's Edith.

123
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:57,777
No, really.

124
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,079
I mean, what's your first name?

125
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,317
It's Edith.

126
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,318
OK.

127
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,053
I think I'll just
stick with Block,

128
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,155
if that's all right with you.

129
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,724
I'd, uh, appreciate that.

131
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,079
So you gonna make me a star?

132
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,490
Sweetie, take care of my new
partner for a minute, will you?

133
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,391
Excuse me, Block.

134
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,191
Sure.

135
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,765
You.

136
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:52,665
Oh, yes.

137
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,566
You're Cooper.

138
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,601
Congratulations.

140
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:58,805
Sorry.

141
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,306
Uh-huh.

142
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,207
Follow me.

143
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:16,756
You know, back in my day,
we didn't have any Vice Girls.

144
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:20,827
But I've decided, uh,
it ain't a bad idea.

145
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,072
Inside.

146
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,618
You know, your name sounds
really familiar to me.

148
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,489
Are you sure we have
worked together before?

149
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,024
I don't think so.

150
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,826
I've worked in San
Francisco most of my career.

151

152
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,729
Love that town.

I got it.

156
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,296
You're that cop that got her
partner shot because you were

157
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,564
too tough to call for backup.

158
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,632
That's enough, Bessley.

159
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,234
No, no, no, I knew
she looked familiar.

160
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,168
I remember now.

161
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,402
You know what
everybody's saying?

162
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,706
That in a way, you
killed your own partner.

163
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,108
Hey!

164
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,310
That incident was a year ago.

165
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,414
I have been totally
cleared of all allegations.

166
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:53,152
Now, as of 12:00 noon today,
I am back on the force.

167
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,187

Lieutenant John Russo?

Yeah.

I left it on the bar.

Great.

were at my disposal.

What-- hey, hey.

190
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,548
Where are you going?

191
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,983
Your cuffs.

192
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,953
[rock music]

193
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,423
I hope you understand.

194
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,792
My future's in your hands.

195
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,142
Did we lose 'em?

196
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,310
Yeah, of course we did.

197
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,246
Nobody can catch us.

198
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,814
What'd you get?

199
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:43,089
Uh-- lots of paper clips,
a fancy pen, and looks

200
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,792
like an adjustable date stamp.

201
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,661
Alls I got was
some stationary.

202
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,065
Well, we can use the pen
and the stationary, and--

203
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:56,269
and write all our loyal friends
and loving families thank yous.

204
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,203
[laughing]

205
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,104
Yeah.

206
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:01,140
All we need are some stamps.

207
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,010
Actually, I'm looking
at my only friend.

208
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,911
Jesse?

209
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,245
JESSE: Yeah?

210
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,248
You think it was a stupid
idea to rob a stationary store?

211
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,384
You mean instead
of, like, a fruit

212
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:15,555
stand or the bank or something?

213
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,023
Yeah.

214
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,326
[laughing]

215
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,306
Hey, Jesse, Polly.

216
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,240
Hey, Coop.

217
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,374
Want to buy a pen?

218
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,844
Let's see it.

219
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,179
Two bucks.

220
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,414
Tell you what.

221
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,883
I got some stuff here, just
some blankets and food.

222
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,684
How about we make a trade?

223
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,856
For a cop, you're not too bad.

224
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,358
So did you guys check out
that runaway shelter yet?

225
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,960
Yeah, we checked it out.

226
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,962
Somebody stole Jesse's
shoes the first night.

227
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,196
Your shoes?

228
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,198
Aw, Jesus.

229
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,600
Sorry about that.

230
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,435
You know, I might have an extra
pair laying around somewhere.

231
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,803
Will you just stop
trying to help us?

232
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,838
We're doing fine, OK?

233
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:10,276
Thanks anyway, Coop,
but, uh, I stole them back.

234
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,377
Listen, there's
something else,

235
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,746
and it's really important.

236
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,648
There's been a few
murders around here--

237
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,049
young kids just like you.

238
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:17,950
A few murders?

239
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,985
I count nine.

240
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:19,919
Where have you been?

241
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,387
Polly, she's just
trying to help.

242
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,289
She's right, it's nine.

243
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,057
Did you know that
last girl, Michelle?

244
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,126
You're even dumber
than I thought.

245
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,127
Of course we knew her.

246
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,395
Take it easy, Polly.

247
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,030
Did you ever see her
talking to anybody or--

248
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,398
I didn't see anything.

249
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,333
Michelle was a very nice kid.

250
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,735
She was just really,
really stupid.

251
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,303
And Jesse and I aren't stupid.

252
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,606
I know you're
not stupid, Polly.

253
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,543
All right, just be careful, OK?

254
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:46,612
Thanks for the stuff.

255
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,016
I'll see you around.

256
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:53,386
Bye, Coop.

257
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,955
Man, you dug into her.

258
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,724
Come on, she's just
looking out for us.

259
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,993
The only person Coop is
looking out for is herself.

260
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:10,369
[phone ringing]

261
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,440
COOPER (ON ANSWERING
MACHINE): This is Cooper.

262
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,508
Leave a message.

263
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,876
[beeping]

264
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:17,944
JOHN (ON SPEAKER PHONE): Cooper.

265
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:21,147
Uh, this is John, John Russo.

266
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,450
I left a couple of
messages before, and, uh--

267
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,351
I know.

268
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,686
I'm sorry I've been so busy.

269
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,421
JOHN (ON SPEAKER PHONE):
--I just thought that after

270
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,424
the other night, um-- that is--

271
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,292
well, I wanted to see you again.

272
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,529
I could take you out
on a proper date.

273
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,598
Who wants a proper date?

274
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,666
JOHN (ON SPEAKER PHONE):
Well, I guess, um--

275
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,268
just give me a call, OK?

276
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,404
555-6373.

277
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,372
Bye.

278
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,240
[phone clicking]

279
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,242
Ugh.

280
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,243
[laughing]

281
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,278
Two eager, Russo.

282
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,122
[ominous music]

283
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,064
Strangulation,
just like the others.

284
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,633
I'd say she was
killed someplace else,

285
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,533
though, then dropped here.

286
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,508
You OK?

287
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,478
What?

288
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,180
Jesse, her name's Jesse.

289
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,682
You knew her.

290
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,384
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,053
I wonder if that was
even her real name.

292
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,089
I was just talking
to them yesterday.

293
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,458
She's 15.

294
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,394
Was 15.

295
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,763
Them?

296
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:46,198
She and her friend Polly.

297
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,034
Well, maybe she saw something?

298
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,939
Let's comb this crime scene.

299
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,508
Can't afford to miss a
thing, not a single thing.

300
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,444
Detective, this
one found the body.

301
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,478
What's your name?

302
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,279
Chrystal.

303
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,451
COOPER: What happened, Chrystal?

304
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,120
I had some business to
conduct here in the alley.

305
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,622
You had business with whom?

306
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:12,959
Forget it, he's long gone.

307
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,660
All right, go on.

308
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,563
So like I already told
the cop, me and the guy

309
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,664
walk down the alley.

310
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,866
Bam, there's this dead body.

311
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,501
He freaks out and takes off.

312
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,871
I have a little bit of a
conscience, so I call the cops.

313
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,306
You didn't see anything else?

314
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,474
No.

315
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,375
All right.

316
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,376
Thanks.

317
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,479
Take down her address
if she has one.

318
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,015
Two interesting
items over by the body.

319
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,483
Notice this?

320
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,919
Lens cap.

321
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,886
Looks new.

322
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:41,787
Yeah.

323
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,356
And this.

324
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,457
What is it, a
piece of plastic?

325
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,358
But it's new.

326
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,726
There's no dirt on it.

327
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:47,960
It's shrink wrapped.

328
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,397
It says Hi8 Super Crown.

329
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,065
Video tape.

330
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,535
That's right.

331
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,939
[suspenseful music]

332
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,390
[sad music]

333
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,188
I think I might
have seen something.

334
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,231
Sweetie, did Wolfgang show?

335
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,200
Yeah, he's in the pool room.

336
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,868
I, uh, told him I was
thinking about putting

337
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,204
some strippers in here
and I needed his advice.

338
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,240
And, well, he bought it and
trotted right on over here.

339
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,677
Listen, you girls be careful,
because he's on to something.

340
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,778
No problem.

341
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,679
Sweetie, thanks.

342
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,448
I owe you one.

343
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,749
Remember, we need this guy.

344
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,018
This has got to work.

345
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,119
Block.

346
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,254
Wolfgang does not
carry a weapon.

347
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,190
We're just gonna talk to him.

348
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,724
Think of it as a
conversation piece.

349
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,100
[snorting]

350
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,000
Hold it!

351
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,901
Vice!

352
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,903
Oh, fuck me.

353
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,605
Didn't they teach you
anything in prison, Wolfie,

354
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,073
or do I have to
send you back there?

355
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,375
Up yours, babe.

356
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,778
[gagging]

357
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,182
Wow.

358
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,017
Maybe you can teach
me that some time.

359
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,319
It would be my pleasure.

360
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:58,924
Penny for your thoughts.

361
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,860
Dollar for your death.

362
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,028
Oh, I just love these
little impromptu gatherings.

363
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,263
Don't you, Wolfie?

364
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,266
Oh, I ain't saying shit
to you till I see my lawyer.

365
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,235
Well, you know, you
might not need your lawyer.

366
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,904
Hey, Sweetie, give me a beer
here for my pal Wolfgang.

367
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,005
Block?

368
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,039
Tomato juice.

369
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,475
Oh, what is this,
a goddamn tea party?

370
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,378
Oh, yeah, Wolfie, and
you're the guest of honor.

371
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,047
We need a favor.
And frankly, you owe us one.

372
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,419
About 3 grams
of favor, I'd say.

373
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,560
I guess you've heard there's
been a rash of killings.

374
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,195
Yeah, hookers.

375
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,096
Kids!

376
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,965
Street kids.
- Yeah?

377
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,267
Well, I don't do kids.

378
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,235
And I never whacked
anybody before.

379
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,370
Hey, what's this all about?

380
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,738
Get on with this, OK?

381
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:46,806
What, are you in a hurry?

382
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,441
Yeah, I got a fucking
pedicure at 2:00.

383
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:52,545
You still own that adult
video store down on Central?

384
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:53,746
Maybe.

385
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,748
You know what maybe gets
you these days, Wolfie?

386
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:58,184
About 10 years in the big house.

387
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,586
And considering your
past indiscretions,

388
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:03,155
I think they might
even keep you longer.

389
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,223
Yeah, yeah, I own the place.

390
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,591
Big deal.

391
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:06,692
Hey, can I get
some of that beer?

392
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,593
I'm dying here.

393
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:08,794
So are these kids.

394
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,400
Russo.

395
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,269
You never called.

396
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,038
Cooper.

397
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,940
This is Lieutenant Mindy Turner.

398
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,840
Chandler brought her on.

399
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,375
She's your tech support.

400
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,276
I know Mindy.

401
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,311
I requested her.

402
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,079
Hello, Coop.

403
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,881
Lieutenant, this
is Detective Block.

404
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,550
[suspenseful music]

405
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,785
I know Block.

406
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:33,686
Well, great.

407
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,154
Then we're all friends here.

408
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,488
Russo, what do you got?

409
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,590
What about him?

410
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,592
What about my beer?

411
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,026
Oh, don't worry about Wolfie.

412
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,962
He's just about to sign
on with the Vice Girls.

413
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,163
Vice Girls?

414
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:44,997
[laughing]

415
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,266
It's cute.

416
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:49,702
Uh, listen, we got a link
here for what it's worth.

417
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,103
Turner.

418
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,571
The lens cap
found at the scene

419
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,507
comes from a Hi8 video
camera, which would

420
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,376
match the Hi8 shrink wrap.

421
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,778
They film a lot of pornography
on this type of camera.

422
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,381
They're not too expensive and
the quality is pretty good.

423
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,183
Well, what do you
think about it, Turner?

424
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:06,685
Well, I'd say somebody
was taping the killings.

425
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,553
Snuff films perhaps?

426
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,591
Hoo.

427
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,493
And snuff film sell
for lots of money.

428
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,295
Don't they, Wolfie?

429
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:17,997
Yeah, well-- well,
I wouldn't know.

430
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,065
I'm only into what's legal.

431
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:24,670
Anyway, I'm a fine, upstanding
member of the community now.

432
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,940
I try to stay away
from that stuff.

433
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,276
Well, we got a list
of suspects here.

434
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:32,011
I want you to invite
them to your little, uh,

435
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,812
autograph party.
- What!

436
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,047
That'll fuck my business!

437
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,082
Yeah, you're already
fucked, Wolfgang!

438
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,684
Coop, I need a word.

439
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,786
You think about it.

440
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,922
Del Vecchio, in my office.

441
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,168
So what's up, Russo?

442
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,537
Well, um, I wanted to--

443
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:03,075
to talk to you about the
party the other night.

444
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:06,245
You and I at the party and, you
know, what happened and all.

445
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,313
But, um, I just--

446
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:09,748
I-- I get the feeling
that you don't.

447
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,483
I don't what?

448
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,518
[laughing]

449
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,687
You just don't want
to talk about it.

450
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,388
Oh, on the contrary, Russo.

451
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,157
I'd love to talk about it.

452
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,058
I had a great time.

453
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:21,427
What about you?

454
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:22,328
Well, yeah.

455
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:23,228
Uh, you know.

456
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,263
I had a-- I had a--

457
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,197
[clearing throat]

458
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:26,999
I had a great time
too, actually.

459
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:27,900
Great.

460
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,703
Then everybody's happy.

461
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:35,641
So were you gonna join me
for a tinkle here, or what?

462
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,642
No, no.

463
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,110
[clattering]

464
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,111
MINDY: Bitch!

465
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,981
[grunting]

466
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:53,425
Ugh!

467
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,326
Hey, hey!

468
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,794
What the hell's going on here?

469
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,864
I thought we were all friends?

470
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,532
Detective Turner knew my old--

471
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,934
[glass shattering]

472
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:02,735
--partner.

473
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,072
Shit.

474
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,778
Are you happy, Turner?

475
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,680
Her partner was my friend.

476
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,181
What, do you think
she did it on purpose?

477
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,516
MINDY: That's not the point!

478
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,852
That is entirely
the point, Mindy.

479
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,553
Do you think
she's the first cop

480
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:27,025
that ever made a mistake, lost
a partner in the line of duty?

481
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,328
All right, maybe she should
have call for a backup.

482
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,362
She didn't.

483
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,565
Maybe she thought
she could handle it.

484
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,833
I made a mistake like
that once myself.

485
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,607
We all make mistakes.

486
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:48,380
We do things that we regret
for the rest of our lives.

487
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,351
Look, you're cops.

488
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,519
People get killed.

489
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,987
That is the goddamn job.

490
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:01,593
So why don't you get
out there and do the job

491
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,562
you've been hired to do.

492
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,363
Catch that killer.

493
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,270
[groaning]

494
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:13,772
I'm all right.

495
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,345
I just love female boding.

496
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,280
Who doesn't?

497
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,249
Why don't you
shut the hell up!

498
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,285
All right, here's the deal.

499
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:29,488
You help us out, and we
forget about your little sinus

500
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,123
condition.

501
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:31,924
You chicks are nuts.

502
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,131
Fuck me.

503
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,941
[rock music playing]

504
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,410
How's it going, Quentin?

505
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,778
It's going great, Mr. Love.

506
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,847
We're selling out of everything.

507
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,416
You know, this is just
like a real movie set.

508
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,384
Dominique Star right
here in the store.

509
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,153
The cops in the back
with a sting operation.

510
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,889
Will you keep your mouth
shut about that, you idiot!

511
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,557
Sorry, boss.

512
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,260
Do you think you could
introduce me to Dominique Star?

513
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,628
All right.

514
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,397
Look, just don't go on about
the movies the way you do, OK?

515
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:16,101
Say hello, nice to meet
you, goodbye, and that's it.

516
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,002
Got it?
- Got it.

517
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:17,803
Go.

518
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,851
Excuse me, Dominique, this
is my store clerk, Quentin.

519
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,320
He wanted to meet you.

520
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,255
Fritzi.

521
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,756
Nice to meet you.

522
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,458
Nice suit.

523
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,692
Thanks.

524
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,728
You know, Miss Star,
I'm a big fan of yours.

525
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,730
I've seen all your movies.

526
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,498
And I'm a filmmaker too.

527
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,000
Maybe we could get
together sometime

528
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,035
and discuss the
state of the cinema?

529
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,303
Trends and applications--

530
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:52,404
[clearing throat]

531
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,672
Nice to meet you.

532
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,040
Goodbye.

533
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,241
Nice to meet you.

534
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,442
Goodbye.

535
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,243
Bye-bye.

536
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,656
Mr. Trope.
[laughing]

537
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:11,557
How are you?

538
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,225
I'm fine, just fine.

539
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,260
Listen, you
asked me to let you

540
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,030
know if I ran into
anything special

541
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,731
in the area of your interest.

542
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,934
Oh, like that last item.

543
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,102
That was superlative.

544
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:27,406
Listen, I have
a live item today.

545
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:28,941
Very tender.

546
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:32,244
You might say, uh,
a young nubile.

547
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:33,245
Oh!

548
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,080
Oh, a nubile!
You don't say?

549
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,281
[laughing]

550
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,749
I do say, Mr. Trope.

551
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,720
And for a mere 60 bucks, she'll
do her little schoolgirl dance

00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:36,454
Stop complaining.
We're undercover.

738
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,622
Ugh.

739
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,090
I'm a little bit too
undercover for my liking.

740
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,559
I think you look great, babe.

741
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,796
- Are you afraid?
- Certainly not.

742
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:45,797
Then pet him.

743
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:46,698
Pet Henry.

744
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,311
WOLFGANG: Tralaine.

745
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,214
Mr. Love, you
skanky smut peddler.

746
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,416
Glad you could make it.
Mint julep?

747
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,885
Thank you.

748
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:10,221
As you can see, I deliver.

749
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:15,326
This is Jan, Edith, and Mindy.

750
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,729
Mindy.

751
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:19,397
An ancient name.

752
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,865
I watched you walk in.

753
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,601
Reminded me of that
beautiful goddess Isis.

754
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:24,803
[laughing]

755
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,505
You must have me confused
with some other goddess.

756
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,406
(WHISPERING) Mindy!

757
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,741
(WHISPERING) What?

758
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:33,178
You know, Tralaine, these
babes really dig your movies.

759
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:34,412
Films, Wolfgang.

760
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,346
Films.

761
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,881
Oh, yes, we love
all your films.

762
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:37,782
Really?

763
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:38,683
Hmm.

764
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:39,817
"Come All Ye Faithful."

765
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,253
A holiday classic.

766
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,221
Is that your video camera?

767
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,255
Oh, one of many.

768
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,424
Marvelous little device, really.

769
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:49,027
"The Night of the
Naughty Necrophiliac."

770
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:51,062
Oh, I loved it!

771
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,597
Looks like you
lost your lens cap.

772
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:55,200
Well, aren't you the observant
little cinematographer.

773
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,169
"The Island of Dr. Lesbo."

774
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,638
Now, that's a movie.

775
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:04,175
Mindy, it's clear to me that
you are a true sex-tellectual.

776
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,276
MINDY: Ah!

777
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,178
It's funny your friends
don't look the type.

778
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,613
COOPER: We don't?

779
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:09,514
No.

780
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,848
What do we look like?

781
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,649
Cops.

782
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:17,288
I'm kidding!

783
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,157
Relaxez-vous!

784
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:22,493
[laughing]

785
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:27,866
Wolfgang, why don't you show Jan
and Edith to the dance floor?

786
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,767
I'll entertain Mindy.

787
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:30,735
Well, I, um--

788
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,971
Let's dance.

789
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:33,972
Uh--

790
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:37,342
[dance music]

791
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,413
Loosen up, Block.

792
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,314
Whip it.

793
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,195
Tralaine, you're
one heck of a dancer.

794
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,764
Isis, you're my
wet dream come true.

795
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,443
Why, hello there, darling.

796
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,845
Hello, Elvis.

797
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:14,679
It's Elroy.

798
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,550
Sheryl, you
really think you're

799
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,488
the only one whose libido is
manipulated by external forces?

800
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,023
Well, I hope not.

801
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,158
I strongly resent
having my libido

802
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:31,329
pulled to and fro by every
Madison Avenue huckster.

803
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,831
Not to mention Hollywood
and its minions.

804
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,235
[dance music]

805
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:43,708

807
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:58,222
[giggling]

808
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,123
Oh yeah.

809
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,197
Hey.

810
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,199
Oh yeah.

811
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,701
Oh baby.

812
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,669
[laughing]

813
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,671
Mm-hmm.

814
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:17,075
[laughing]

815
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,424
[groaning]

816
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,362
Fascinating.

817
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:44,836
I mean--

818
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,104
[laughing nervously]

819
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,606
I split and I-- and I go
home and I get in the shower.

820
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,876
And all of a sudden, I'm
staring at the shower head.

821
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,644
And-- and, you know,
I'm staring at it.

822
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,280
And I start thinking, what
if shower heads could talk?

823
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:02,487
Well, I'm finding I'm
becoming a really big, big star.

824
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:04,689
What if the damn
thing had eyes?

825
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,757
What if it's looking at me?

826
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:07,024
Hey, what if it's
looking at me right now?

827
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:14,899
So, Isis.

828
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,934
You're quite sure you'd
like to work in film--

829
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,269
my film?

830
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,071
Tralaine, it's
a dream come true.

831
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,472
That's good.

832
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,674
I'll arrange a little audition.

833
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,446
Detective Cooper?

834
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:29,347
What are you doing here?

835
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:30,815
I'm undercover, Quentin.

836
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:32,283
Cool it.

837
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,252
You've certainly got the
look down for this party,

838
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:35,319
Detective Cooper.

839
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,522
My friends call me Coop.

840
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:39,023
How'd you get into
this party anyway?

841
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,158
I thought it was
pretty exclusive?

842
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:41,259
It's all who you know.

843
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,728
You know, I'm kind of
Tralaine's protege.

844
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,997
He's actually quite
brilliant, and he's very, very

845
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,632
well-respected in the genre.

846
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,167
You snuck in, didn't you?

847
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,202
They think I'm part
of the kitchen staff.

848
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:52,437
[laughing]

849
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,340
What are you looking
for down there?

850
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,742
Actually, I--

851
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,743
No, don't tell me.

852
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,211
You lost your lens cap.

853
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:01,112
Yeah.

854
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:02,246
Did you find it?

855
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,047
No.

856
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,118
So, yeah, yeah.

857
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,986
So I jumped out of the shower.

858
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,388
I couldn't take it anymore.

859
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:13,758
[tango music]

860
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:15,827
Tango?

861
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:16,694
Why not?

862
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:27,338
It would appear that
Tralaine has made his choice.

863
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,940
You think she'll be OK?

864
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,809
My impression has been that
Mindy can take of herself.

865
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:32,944
[laughing]

866
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,779
She really nailed you
with that beer bottle.

867
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:38,549
I would remind you that
she took me by surprise.

868
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,551
Well, no sense in
wasting an open bar.

869
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,452
Come on, Block.

870
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,587
Coop, I told you.

871
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:43,721
I don't drink.

872
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,656
I know, but maybe
they've got some imported

873
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,425
guava juice or something.
Come on.

874
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:48,392
Hmm.

875
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,094
I quite like guava juice.

876
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:54,899
I haven't showered since.

877
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:55,800
I can't.

878
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,001
I can't!

879
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:59,036
Fred, I think
you're full of crap.

[rock music]

881
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,842
I've been thinking
about my older days.

882
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:09,213
And I'm wondering if I'm
wasting my life away.

883
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,783
To me, the creative
act is one of struggle.

884
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,753
An effervescent battle
between heaven and earth.

885
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,289

thrusting, undulat--

Mr. Tralaine.

889
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:27,765
I don't know you.
How did you get into my party?

890
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,367
Actually, I--

891
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,635
Where did you get
that video camera?

892
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:32,737
Did you steal it?

893
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:34,038
Absolutely not, sir.

894
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,840
I'm a filmmaker too.

895
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,241
And I'm your biggest fan.

896
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,176
A fan!

897
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,544
Well.

898
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:41,279
Do you mind?

899
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:42,380
I'd be honored.

900
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,348
Ah.

902
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,652
Now get out.

903
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:49,654
But I've seen all your movies.

904
00:44:49,654 --> 00:44:51,689
Get out before I
have you thrown out.

905
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,490
Out.

906

We have got to
get her out of here

before she blows our cover.

908
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:06,837
Come on, can't you
at least try and walk?

909
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,072
I can walk.

910
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,073
This is bad.

911
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,374
This is very bad.

912
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,976
Are you guys ignoring me?

913
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:13,277
We're not ignoring you.

914
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,245
Let's go.

just love you guys.

916
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:19,584
I'm fine.

00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:20,384
You are not.

918
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,356
Come on, let me go.

919
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:38,169
Will you quit looking
at me like that, Block?

00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:39,203
I know my limit.

921
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:42,273
Well, it doesn't
appear that you do.

922
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:44,141
Look, thanks for
the ride, Block.

923
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:47,411
Goodnight.

924
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,381
Do you need
anything before I go?

925
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:54,185
Um-- there's some
aspirin on the bookshelf

926
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,320
in my dining room.

927
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,922
Could you bring me four?

928
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:58,823
[laughing]

929
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:12,303
[suspenseful music]

930
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,255
Here.

931
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,162
Why do you have a
picture of you and Polly?

932
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:45,836
Detective, what does
this picture mean?

933
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,972
It's none of your
goddamn business.

934
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,874
This girl is involved
in the investigation

935
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:52,243
of several homicides.

936
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,011
If you don't tell me the
nature of this picture,

937
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,480
I'll have no other choice than
to involve Captain Chandler.

938
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,848
Yeah, you're a
good cop, Block,

939
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:58,983
but you gotta
loosen up a little.

940
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,625
Look, I haven't
done anything wrong,

941
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,894
unless you call having
a picture of my sister

942
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:10,961
in my home a crime.

943
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,263
Your sister?

944
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:16,167
Yeah, Polly's my sister.

945
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:19,437
Our parents were killed
three years ago by a--

946
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,438
it doesn't matter.

947
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:23,674
They're dead, all right?

948
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,177
Polly came to live with me.

949
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,379
It just didn't work, you know?

950
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:31,582
I mean, we fought all the time.

951
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:36,287
Well-- I drank and she fought.

952
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:38,622
I tried try to convince
her to come home,

953
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,857
but she just wouldn't.

954
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,159
You know, I've tried,
and I've tried, but she--

955
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,963
You have not
tried hard enough.

956
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,298
You know, there
isn't a day that

957
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:49,333
goes by that I don't
worry about her

958
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:52,303
and wonder what scumbag
she might have to--

959
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:56,841
she's a big girl, Block.

960
00:47:56,841 --> 00:47:57,775
You know?

961
00:47:57,775 --> 00:48:01,545
Polly is 15 years old.
She's 15!

962
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:07,485
Goodnight, Block.

963
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:27,872
But why did he pick me?

964
00:48:27,872 --> 00:48:30,040
I'm just supposed
to be tech support.

965
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,408
Oh, relax, Melissa.

966
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,777
You techies are
always fantasizing

967
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:34,178
about getting down and dirty.

968
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:35,079
Here's your chance.

969
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,114
You ladies OK?

970
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,250
Yeah, Sweetie, we're fine.

971
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,285
Listen, uh, I owe
you another one.

972
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:42,920
You got that right.

973
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,121
What are you doing anyway?

974
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,090
Modern science, Sweetie.

975
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,926
Mindy rigged up this,
uh, high-tech bullet bra.

976
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,194
It's coming pretty handy.

977
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:52,296
It's got audio
visual capabilities,

978
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:57,101
computerized chassis, and
it's fully adjustable.

979
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,602
This way she can keep
in contact with Block

980
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,404
and myself at all times.

981
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:04,141
And the underwire
acts as the antenna.

982
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,609
OK.

983
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,978
Let's, uh, check
that nipple focus.

984
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,521
Looks good from here.

985
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,156
Picture perfect.

986
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:20,891
Switching to tracking.

987
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,092
Great.

988
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:23,394
Also, should Tralaine
want to take her

989
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,196
elsewhere for the
audition, we can track

990
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:27,097
for miles with this thing.

991
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:29,433
Hey, there we are.
I'm impressed.

992
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:36,774
What are you staring at?

993
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:38,742
I was just contemplating
whether perspiration

994
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:41,011
could cause any kind
of electrical shock.

995
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,913
It's fully grounded.

996
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,615
Where are you gonna
hide your piece?

997
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:45,850
Don't ask.

998
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:46,951
Hey, Sweetie.
SWEETIE: Hey.

999
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,752
How you doing, buddy?
- Good, man.

1000
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,120
Block.

1001
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,089
Wow.

1002
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,458
Mindy, you look-- slutty.

1003
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,392
Thanks, Russo.

1004
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,328
Yeah.

1005
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,563
Detective.

1006
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:00,364
Russo.

1007
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:07,404
Well, I just came by to
see if you needed anything.

1008
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:09,373
We don't need
your help, Russo.

1009
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,308
You're the one who sent Chandler
to Wolfgang's video store

1010
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,110
after us in the first place.

1011
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,278
It was not pleasant.

1012
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:15,212
Well.

1013
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,047
I just did it by
the book, Cooper.

1014
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,415
Section 12, paragraph 4--

1015
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,817
You know, that's
your problem, Russo.

1016
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:21,185
You're a friggin' bookworm!

1017
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:24,154
Coop, I suggest we don't
have time for this right now.

1018
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,789
Bookworm?

1019
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:28,158
Well, thank you very
much, Vice Girl.

1020
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,793
In my office now.

1021
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:40,604
Yeah, yeah, very nice.

1022
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,676
What?

1023
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:49,046
[rock music]

1024
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:59,023
[moaning]

1025
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:26,016
[clearing throat]

1026
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,118
And I hope that's
perfectly clear, Mr. Russo.

1027
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,323
What happened?

1028
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:33,924
Where's Russo?

1029
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,193
You know, Coop, I think you
should take it easy on the guy.

1030
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,095
I think he's got a crush on you.

1031
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,029
Think so?

1032
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,864
So, everybody ready?

1033
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,366
Block?
- Ready.

1034
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:43,934
- Mindy?
- Ready.

1035
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,269
Sweetie?

1036
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,271
For a guy that ain't going
no place, I guess I'm ready.

1037
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:50,374
Great.
Let's do it.

1038
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:51,642
Take it easy, girls.

1039
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,615
And good luck.

1040
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:03,053
Oh my god, there's Polly.

1041
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,255
Where the hell have you been?

1042
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,358
Leave me alone.

1043
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:09,026
Polly, what happened?

1044
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:10,494
Look, why don't
you just get back

1045
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,030
in the car with your friends
and leave me the hell alone.

1046
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:15,933
Polly, why the hell
did you run out on us?

1047
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:18,102
I couldn't ID the guy.

1048
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:19,136
It was too dark that night.

1049
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,706
I thought I could,
but I couldn't.

1050
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:23,707
Polly, can't you see?
If--

1051
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:24,942
Look, I know what
you're gonna say.

1052
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:26,377
You're gonna tell me
to get off the streets

1053
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:27,878
and go live with you.

1054
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,481
What is with this sudden
interest in my life?

1055
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,849
What, did you run out
of money for booze?

1056
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:37,254
Polly.

1057
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,624

TRALAINE (ON INTERCOM):
Come in, Isis.

00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:28,872
[whip cracking]

1061
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,475
Oh, mighty Isis.

1062
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:32,810
Tralaine.

1063
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,044
Come in, my beloved.

1064
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:42,319
I won't be long, dear.

1065
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,421
I'm just shooting a very
emotional scene upstairs.

1066
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,123
Pivotal moment for the
characters, really.

1067
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:48,826
Oh, I'm so weary of lifting
everyone up, up, up.

1068
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:51,395
Although it is
creatively invigorating.

1069
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,563
Don't go away, now.

1070
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:56,867
I do so love auditions.

1071
00:53:56,867 --> 00:54:00,804
MINDY (ON MICROPHONE):
I just got stage fright.

1072
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:04,208
[suspenseful music]

1073
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:12,216
OK, I'm out.

1074
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,655
Doing some snooping.

1075
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,124
Switching to visual.

1076
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:54,024
Nothing downstairs.

1077
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,092
Gonna go to the second floor.

1078
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:01,131
Be careful, Melissa.

1079
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,633
She can't hear you.

1080
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:03,534
I know.

1081
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:22,019
[moaning]

1082
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:22,920
I'm upstairs.

1083
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:28,125
Here some people moaning.

1084
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,026
Must be the movie.

1085
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:31,762
It sounds pretty fake.

1086
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:33,030
I'm gonna take a peek.

1087
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:52,316
Tralaine's in there.

1088
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:53,317
I think he's got a gun.

1089
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:54,685
This doesn't
feel right, Block.

1090
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:55,786
Get in there.

1091
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:56,987
I'll call for backup
and be right behind you.

1092
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:03,427
Good, good, good, Bob.

1093
00:56:03,427 --> 00:56:06,263
Now move aside.

1094
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:08,265
Hey, what the hell!

1095
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:09,266
No, don't!

1096
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:10,234
[gunshot]

1097
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:11,335
Tralaine, no!

1098
00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:12,336
[gunshot]

1099
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:13,237
Vice.

1100
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:14,037
Everybody freeze!

1101
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,547
Hey, what's going on?

1102
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:26,883
This isn't in the script.

1103
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,419
What the hell
is going on here?

1104
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:31,521
It's a movie!

1105
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:32,990
What?

1106
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,791
Fake bullets, fake blood.

1107
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,526
She's fine.

1108
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:37,794
You're fine, right?

1109
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:38,996
Fine.

1110
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:39,896
Fine?

1111
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,064
Yeah, I'm fine.

1112
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,000
Don't shoot me, mighty Isis!

1113
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,068
I don't have a gun,
Tralaine, or I just might.

1114
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:45,969
It was an accident!

1115
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,904
Your startled me!

1116
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,239
Isis, you're magnificent.

1117
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,407
Stupendous.

1118
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,643
Sex-sational.

1119
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:55,212
Tralaine, what
is going on here?

1120
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:57,047
We're making magic, of course!

1121
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,349
And, well, simply
buckets of money.

1122
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,084
The really sick people
out there think it's real,

1123
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:05,922
and I'm only too happy
to supply the illusion.

1124
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,424
How old are you?

1125
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,626
Uh, 21.

1126
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:10,694
COOPER: Yeah, let's see your ID.

1127
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:12,963
I-- I left it my other pants.

1128
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:13,864
What other pants?

1129
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:14,998
You're not wearing any pants.

1130
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,133
How old are you?

1131
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:18,302
17.

1132
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:19,736
17.

1133
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:21,138
I'm surrounded by vipers!

1134
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,575
Book him.

1135
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,851
Yes, yes, she was fine.

1136
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,519
But you know how it is.

1137
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,956
They only seem to
last through one film.

1138
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:13,824
The cops?

1139
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:16,093
Well, they had to let me go.

1140
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:18,562
My lawyer is too good for 'em.

1141
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:20,630
Besides, what do you
think they have on me?

1142
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,466
A 17-year-old hooker?

1143
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:24,134
She'll never testify.

1144
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:27,771
You can trust me on that one.

1145
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:30,707
Yes, it was a good thing
I was firing blanks.

1146
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,542
But the footage
does not look good.

1147
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:37,180
I think we'll have to go back
to tried and true methods.

1148
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,016
Yes, I got some good
possibilities at the party.

1149
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:40,817
Mm-hmm.

1150
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:48,125
I'm well aware of that, Steve.

1151
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,326
Well, you'll just
have to stall them.

1152
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:56,266
[gagging]

1153
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,275
All right.

1154
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,210
This is Grandma's recipe.

1155
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,713
She's probably looking down
at us in complete shock

1156
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:12,249
that I'm cooking, let
alone cooking her soup.

1157
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:22,893
Let me see that thermometer.

1158
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:26,229
Hey, it looks like
that aspirin worked.

1159
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,599
You're getting better already.

1160
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,567
Go ahead, eat.

1161
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,375
Remember this day?

1162
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:42,379
Yeah, I remember it.

1163
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:44,014
It was before I knew
what a lush was.

1164
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:51,788
Look, Polly, I know
I've been a rotten sister.

1165
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:54,391
I know I've let you down.
Nobody's perfect.

1166
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:56,126
I mean, I'm not.

1167
00:59:56,126 --> 01:00:00,230
Mom and Dad being gone
still really hurts.

1168
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,798
But what hurts me even
more is knowing you're

1169
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:02,599
out there on the streets.

1170
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:08,605
I wish things could be
different, you know.

1171
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,408
I mean, I just wish that
you would make an effort.

1172
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:12,742
You could try.

1173
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:13,543
Spare me.

1174
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,114
I'm gonna go
crash on the couch.

1175
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:42,472
[plates clattering]

1176
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,975
Morning.

1177
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,943
Hi.

1178
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:49,246
I thought I'd make us some eggs.

1179
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:52,148
Is that OK?

1180
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,417
Yeah, it's great.

1181
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:57,721
[phone ringing]

1182
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,091
Cooper.

1183
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:02,792
EDITH (ON PHONE): It's Block.

1184
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,461
Yeah, Block, what is it?

1185
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:06,463
EDITH (ON PHONE):
We received a tape.

1186
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:07,964
What kind of a tape?

1187
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,599
EDITH (ON PHONE):
It's the real thing.

1188
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,701
Apparently from our killer.

1189
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,103
It was addressed to you.

1190
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:15,672
All right, listen.

1191
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,673
Meet met at Sweetie's bar.

1192
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,707
I don't want to
run into Chandler.

1193
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:25,348
Listen, Polly, I have to go.

1194
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,683
Yeah well, me too.

1195
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,084
I gotta go.

1196
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,653
No, listen.

1197
01:01:29,653 --> 01:01:33,123
Polly, I want you to stay
here with me and be safe.

1198
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:35,458
Will you just try it?

1199
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:36,259
Please?

1200
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:43,300
OK.

1201
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,204
Great.

1202
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,906
I'll call you as soon
as I can, all right?

1203
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:50,707
OK.

1204
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:02,586
Sweetie, what can I say?

1205
01:02:02,586 --> 01:02:03,453
Three.

1206
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,754
You owe me three.

1207
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,056
Yeah, I know.

1208
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:06,856
Let's see the tape.

1209
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,073
WOMAN (ON VIDEO): So,
you're gonna make me a star?

1210
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:26,276
[suspenseful music]

1211
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,715
This is so cool.

1212
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:33,583
I feel like a real movie star.

1213
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,629
Great music.

1214
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:46,529
Towards you?

1215
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,005
[gagging]

1216
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:02,479
[muffled yelling]

1217
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,785
That was no fake.

1218
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:09,786
Indeed.

1219
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,855
Analysis, Block?

1220
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:12,956
The brand name
on that cassette

1221
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:15,425
matches that of the
shrink wrap in evidence.

1222
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:17,494
It appears to be
the same killer.

1223
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:19,062
Go on.

1224
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:20,930
Well, the killer's hand
reaching from behind the camera

1225
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,033
appeared to be a man's hand.

1226
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:25,068
And based on the strength
required for strangulation,

1227
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:27,237
I'd say that was
a same assumption.

1228
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:29,005
And this tape was
dropped off, not mailed?

1229
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:29,806
That's correct.

1230
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:36,880
Take the tape back
to headquarters.

1231
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,214
Start going through
all the surveillance

1232
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:39,449
tapes of the precinct entrance.

1233
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:40,917
That will take some time.

1234
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:43,553
Well, then get going.

1235
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:44,821
- Turner.
- Yes, Coop.

1236
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:45,722
Help Block.

1237
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:47,457
I was afraid you'd say that.

1238
01:03:57,233 --> 01:04:01,104
Buy you a beer?

1239
01:04:01,104 --> 01:04:02,172
What?

1240
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,239
A beer.

1241
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,175
Can I buy you a beer?

1242
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:08,078
Isn't it against
regulations to drink on duty?

1243
01:04:08,078 --> 01:04:10,313
It's 10 AM already.

1244
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,015
What are you, a
bookworm or something?

1245
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,055
Block, I wanted
to tell you that--

1246
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,356
I-- I just wanted--

1247
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,524
I've been trying
to tell you that--

1248
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,693
Yes, Detective?

1249
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,663
Well, you remember back at
Tralaine's mansion, right?

1250
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:28,765
Yes, I can recall that.

1251
01:04:28,765 --> 01:04:30,967
I know you can
remember it, Block.

1252
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,670
Do you have to be so damn
literal all the time?

1253
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,071
I do endeavor to be precise.

1254
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,540
Well, that's not
the point, Block.

1255
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,775
I'm trying to say thank you.

1256
01:04:41,745 --> 01:04:42,712
Thank you?

1257
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:43,913
Yes.

1258
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,648
For what?

1259
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:48,685
For saving my life.

1260
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:50,186
Actually, I did
not save your life.

1261
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:55,925
Tralaine was firing blanks.

1262
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:58,094
Yeah, but you didn't know
that when you jumped between us.

1263
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,063
And I just wanted
to say thank you.

1264
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:02,365
I only did what any other
trained law enforcement

1265
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,967
officer would have done.

1266
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:06,136
So your thank you is misplaced.

1267
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:08,071
I'm trying to say
thank you, you idiot.

1268
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:11,608
You're welcome.

1269
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,646
And, Block?

1270
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:17,781
Yes?

1271
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:20,850
About what happened
in San Francisco.

1272
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,619
I-- I know you're a good cop.

1273
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:27,724
You know what, Sweetie?

1274
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:30,960
I think I'll, uh,
have coffee instead.

1275
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,761
Coffee?

1276
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:36,833
I'm turning over a new leaf.

1277
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:38,601
Coffee is a sensible drink.

1278
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,637
You want regular or decaf?

1279
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:41,437
Don't push it.

1280
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:49,379
All right, so what
shall we toast to?

1281
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:51,481
Let's toast to family.

1282
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:53,516
I will toast to family.

1283
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:58,421
To all the families all over
the world, carpe diem, and e

1284
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:01,224
pluribus unum, and
justice for all.

1285
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:07,497
You know, I didn't think
it would happen, Russo,

1286
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:10,900
but, uh, you may
be coming around.

1287
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,435
Is that a good thing?

1288
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:15,205
Well, you passed the head
test with flying colors.

1289
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:16,506
RUSSO: The head test?

1290
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:18,041
Great head on demand.

1291
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:19,809
You're obedient, Russo.

1292
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,044
I like that in a love slave.

1293
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:21,845
Thank you.

1294
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,550
What?

1295
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,118
What is it?

1296
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:30,653
Your tie.

1297
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,554
RUSSO: My tie.

1298
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:32,655
You like that?

1299
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:33,656
No, no, no.

1300
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,558
On the tape.

1301
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:36,759
The tie.

1302
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:39,696
The victim had a skinny
little tie around her neck.

1303
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:42,131
Where have I seen a
tie like that before?

1304
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,099
I don't know.

1305
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,568
Tie Town?

1306
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,937
How could I be so stupid!

1307
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:50,974
What-- what's the name of
that guy, uh, the video guy--

1308
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:51,875
Wolfgang Love.

1309
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,943
No, no, the other guy.

1310
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:55,178
Oh, Quentin?

1311
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:56,079
Yeah, exactly!

1312
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,113
Sweetie, give me the phone.

1313
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:58,248
Wait-- wait a minute.

1314
01:06:58,248 --> 01:07:00,984
Are you talking about
Wolfgang's assistant?

1315
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:04,387
That weird, quirky little guy,
always wears the same outfit?

1316
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:05,455
That's the one.

1317
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:07,156
I gotta call Polly.

1318
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:09,692
His name's not
Quentin, it's Arnold.

1319
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,728
Arnold, uh, Hilowitz.

1320
01:07:11,728 --> 01:07:13,863
I know because I've
checked his ID a dozen

1321
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,465
times just to bust his balls.

1322
01:07:15,465 --> 01:07:18,601
[phone ringing]

1323
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,506
Shit, no answer.

1324
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:24,407
Arnold Hilowitz?

1325
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:25,842
I'm sure of it.

1326
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:27,477
Let's hit it, Russo.

1327
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:33,716
She's gone.

1328
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,618
He's got her, I can feel it.

1329
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:37,120
Maybe she just
left on her own?

1330
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,422
No, this place is a mess.

1331
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:40,323
So what?

1332
01:07:40,323 --> 01:07:42,892
Russo, Polly's not like that.

1333
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,596
And look, a street kid does
not leave her jacket behind.

1334
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:48,798
Nah, it doesn't feel right.

1335
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:51,334
Something bad has happened.

1336
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:54,237
Get an APB out on Arnold
Hilowitz aka Quentin.

1337
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,972
Call Block and
Turner at the station

1338
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:57,540
and have them meet me here.

1339
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,275
Then meet me at
Wolfgang's video store.

1340
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,377
I'm taking your car.

1341
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:02,178
Here you go.

1342
01:08:25,335 --> 01:08:26,135
Shit!

1343
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:38,581
[muffled yelling]

1344
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,260
Locked.

1345
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,495
All locked up, Block.

1346
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:53,396
What do you think?

1347
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:54,397
A little persuasion.

1348
01:08:54,397 --> 01:08:55,398
No.

1349
01:08:55,398 --> 01:08:56,499
No, we don't have
a search warrant.

1350
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:57,433
Russo!

1351
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:58,334
Where's Coop?

1352
01:08:58,334 --> 01:08:59,369
She should be here.

1353
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:00,169
Russo!

1354
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:03,072
All right.

1355
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:09,445
[rock music]

1356
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:17,787
Block, Russo!

1357
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:21,891
He's dead.

1358
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,693
Ah, shit.

1359
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:25,228
I'll call the Captain.

1360
01:09:25,228 --> 01:09:26,596
You two need to find Coop.

1361
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:28,498
Coop's place first?

1362
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:29,732
Might be some clues there.

1363
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:30,633
Then Tralaine's mansion.

1364
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:31,634
It should be empty.

1365
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:32,435
Go!

1366
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:38,841
[suspenseful music]

1367
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,145
[breathing heavily]

1368
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:44,914
Hilowitz, you
murdering bastard!

1369
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:45,715
Where is my sister?

1370
01:09:47,884 --> 01:09:48,684
It's Quentin.

1371
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:55,191
Polly!

1372
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,325
Are you OK!

1373
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,527
Mm-hmm.

1374
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:58,661
Has he done anything to you?

1375
01:09:58,661 --> 01:09:59,462
Uh-uh.

1376
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:04,200
Say something, Coop.

1377
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,302
I always knew you'd make
an excellent actress.

1378
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:09,072
I just had to have you
in one of my films.

1379
01:10:09,072 --> 01:10:11,174
And now I've had the
good fortune of snagging

1380
01:10:11,174 --> 01:10:13,109
both Cooper sisters.

1381
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:14,744
What a coup!

1382
01:10:14,744 --> 01:10:16,746
I know that you're
both ready to give

1383
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:18,514
a really excellent performance.

1384
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:21,918
I'm not performing anything
for you, you bastard!

1385
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:23,920
And that's the key, isn't it?

1386
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:29,559
You're not performing, and
yet what a performance.

1387
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,360
COOPER: What are you
talking about, Hilowitz?

1388
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,695
I'm talking
about how difficult

1389
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:37,133
it is to find somebody who
can make it truly believable.

1390
01:10:37,133 --> 01:10:39,102
You know what I mean?

1391
01:10:39,102 --> 01:10:41,504
You're sick, Arnold.

1392
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:43,873
Never call me Arnold.

1393
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,781
[locator beeping]

1394
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:03,326
And those other
two, your partners.

1395
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:06,996
What are their names,
Blockhead and Curly?

1396
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:09,532
They just don't have
that special something

1397
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:12,301
that the camera loves.

1398
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:13,669
But you have it, Coop.

1399
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:16,739
And a nickname to boot.

1400
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:18,341
Look, if it's me you
want, you've got me.

1401
01:11:18,341 --> 01:11:20,810
Why don't you let Polly go?

1402
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:22,111
Oh, no.

1403
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,281
If I did that, I'd have to
rewrite the entire script.

1404
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,116
And believe me, that
can be a real pain

1405
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,951
in the ass for the director.

1406
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:32,455
You'd be lucky
to direct traffic.

1407
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:34,891
That's what my
ex-boss Wolfgang said.

1408
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:37,894
COOPER: What do
you mean ex-boss?

1409
01:11:37,894 --> 01:11:39,495
Oh, didn't you hear?

1410
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:43,065
Wolfgang went to that
big peep show in the sky.

1411
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:46,936
Can you believe that bastard
wanted me to work overtime?

1412
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:48,638
Well, forget it.

1413
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,573
Not for minimum wage.

1414
01:11:50,573 --> 01:11:52,842
So I shoved a few of my
favorite films down his throat,

1415
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:53,643
and that was that.

1416
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,348
Do you think I qualify
for unemployment?

1417
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:06,222
Top five, in no special order.

1418
01:12:06,222 --> 01:12:07,690
That's easy.

1419
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:08,591
"Godfather."

1420
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:09,992
Of course.

1421
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,127
"Taxi Driver."

1422
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:12,395
COOPER: Naturally.

1423
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:13,796
"Midnight Cowboy."

1424
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:15,665
COOPER: I love that one.

1425
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:16,999
How many is that?

1426
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,601
Three.

1427
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:19,802
Gosh, let's see.

1428
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:21,838
No special order, remember.

1429
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,306
Right, thank god for that.

1430
01:12:23,306 --> 01:12:25,908
COOPER: I know.

1431
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:27,343
Oh!

1432
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,512
"The Magnificent Seven."

1433
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:30,847
Interesting.

1434
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:31,647
One more.

1435
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,653
"Guys and Dolls."

1436
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:38,955
Really?

1437
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:41,557
Would have never pegged you
for a musical theater guy.

1438
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:43,826
Oh, yeah, I love that stuff.

1439
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:45,328
In fact, I'm hoping
to make my life

1440
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:47,730
story into a musical someday.

1441
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:50,299
Kind of a neurotic thriller.

1442
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:52,902
A real song and
dance man, huh?

1443
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:54,570
You betcha.

1444
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:56,105
Hey!

1445
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:57,373
What are you trying to pull?

1446
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,208
You think I'm fresh out of
film school or something?

1447
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:17,326
I believe this is your
gun, Detective Cooper.

1448
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:18,961
I'm not usually
much into firearms,

1449
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:22,031
although they do come in handy.

1450
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:24,767
I'm more the hands-on type.

1451
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:26,802
I think you know what I mean.

1452
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:28,604
Did you get a chance
to view my work?

1453
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,473
Your work?

1454
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:33,142
The tape I sent you.

1455
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:35,177
You're a sick fuck, Arnold.

1456
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:35,978
I said Quentin!

1457
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:40,650
So did you see it?

1458
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:42,385
Yeah, I saw it.

1459
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:43,819
What'd you think?

1460
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,454
COOPER: Of what?

1461
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:48,024
Her performance.

1462
01:13:48,024 --> 01:13:50,860
She was good.

1463
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,862
She stank!

1464
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:54,263
She couldn't take direction.

1465
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,431
She couldn't hit her marks.

1466
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:58,134
That girl couldn't
act to save her life.

1467
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:00,002
Now it's your turn, Polly.

1468
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:01,203
Let's see what you can do.

1469
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:02,171
What do you say?

1470
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,472
Quentin, don't do it!

1471
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:07,510
You asshole!

1472
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:08,511
You killed Jesse!

1473
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,579
She couldn't take
direction either.

1474
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:11,647
Polly!

1475
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,382
I'm sorry, Jan.

1476
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:16,419
COOPER: It's my fault. I'm
the one who should be sorry.

1477
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:17,553
Hmm.

1478
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:19,622
That was pretty good,
but let's try once more.

1479
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:20,623
With feeling.

1480
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:21,590
No!

1481
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,491
No!

1482
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:23,526
Please don't!

1483
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:24,560
Don't!

1484
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,029
Gee, Polly, you put
the rest to shame.

1485
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,964
Let's loosen you up and
see what you can do, huh?

1486
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:42,445
Now stand on the bed, Polly.

1487
01:14:42,445 --> 01:14:44,347
Go ahead, Polly.

1488
01:14:44,347 --> 01:14:45,548
It'll be all right.

1489
01:14:45,548 --> 01:14:46,782
Do it, Polly!

1490
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:47,817
Stand on the bed!

1491
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,527
Now dance a jig.

1492
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:01,731
The cute little ditty that
would make your parents proud.

1493
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:03,833
You don't have
to do that, Polly.

1494
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,601
There you go again!

1495
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:06,702
One director.

1496
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:07,937
One set.

1497
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:11,407
You know, Polly, now would
be a great time to tell

1498
01:15:11,407 --> 01:15:14,443
him to go straight to hell!

1499
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:15,311
Go to hell.

1500
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:20,516
You're ruining everything.

1501
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,351
I know, Arnold.

1502
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,252
Ugh!

1503
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:26,689
Get the gun, Polly!

1504
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:27,690
Back off!

1505
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,557
Untie me, Polly!

1506
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:42,438
Now dance.

1507
01:15:42,438 --> 01:15:46,876
I said dance, Arnold!

1508
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:51,013
This is for Jesse!
EDITH: Freeze!

1509
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:52,014
Vice!

1510
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,049
This is a closed set.

[gunshots]

1512
01:15:58,087 --> 01:15:58,888
Cut.

1513
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:10,633
Jan.

1514
01:16:10,633 --> 01:16:12,034
Are you OK?

1515
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:14,403
Of course I'm OK.

1516
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,906
Block, untie me.

1517
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:19,708
He's dead, Jan.

1518
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:21,343
Are you OK?

1519
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:23,179
That's the question.

1520
01:16:23,179 --> 01:16:25,347
I don't know.

1521
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:28,384
I'm shaking all over.

1522
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:30,319
What took you guys so long?

1523
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:31,620
We got here as
soon as we could.

1524
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,622
Just in time, I'd say.

1525
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:36,559
I killed him.

1526
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:39,528
I killed the murderer.

1527
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,330
No, you didn't.

1528
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:44,433
Detectives Turner
and Block did it.

1529
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,603
But I shot him with your gun.

1530
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,605
No, it-- it was
Tralaine's gun.

1531
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,807
It only shoots blanks.

1532
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:54,110
Now aren't you glad you
didn't kill somebody?

1533
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:01,984
I was so scared.

1534
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:03,619
Oh, I know, sweetie, I know.

1535
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,087
[crying]

1536
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:07,289
But it's all over.

01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:10,226
And I promise you that no one
is ever gonna hurt you again.

[suspenseful music]

1539
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:15,731
It's gonna be OK.

He's an ex what?

1541
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,705
Agent.

1542
01:17:22,705 --> 01:17:25,007
Turns out Quentin was Arnold
Hilowitz, ex Hollywood

1543
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,042
agent and big time psycho.

1544
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,744
They all want to direct.

1545
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:30,379
When no one would let
him behind the camera,

1546
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,114
he decided to branch
out on his own.

1547
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:34,617
Coop, did you ever suspect
that Quentin was after you?

1548
01:17:34,617 --> 01:17:35,751
Not at all.

1549
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,653
I guess Polly must have
been next on his list.

1550
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,054
He followed her to my house.

1551
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:40,222
I was his lucky bonus.

1552
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:41,323
It's a good
thing Polly doesn't

know the truth about that gun.

1554
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:43,926
What gun?

1555
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:44,827
Never mind.

1556
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:45,828
All right.

1557
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:49,198
Can I buy you a drink, Coop?

1558
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:50,799
No thanks.

1559
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:52,301
- How is Polly?
- Great.

1560
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:54,370
She's back at the house with me,
and she's talking about going

1561
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:55,804
back to high school.

1562
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:57,573
It's hard to believe
that we spent so much time

1563
01:17:57,573 --> 01:18:00,209
at that video store with Polly
trying to catch a killer who

1564
01:18:00,209 --> 01:18:01,644
was right under our noses.

1565
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:02,778
You know, it sure is.

1566
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,780
I remember this one
time I was on this case.

1567
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,081
And it was in--

01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:07,516
Sorry, Sweetie, you know
I've already heard this one.

1569
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,552
Would you excuse
us for a minute?

1570
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:13,322
All right, but just--
just one more thing, Coop.

1571
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:14,690
What's that?

1572
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:19,428
How in the world did Mindy
and Block find Quentin's place?

1573
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:21,797
Sweetie, I'm surprised at you.

1574
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:24,433
That's an easy one.

1575
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:28,938
All it took was brains,
brawn, and one hell of a bra.

come out at night

mine I want you to see.

you made the grade.
