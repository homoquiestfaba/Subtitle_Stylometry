Horror 2004 1080p [H246-mp4] English</b>

2
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,379
Awful soft dirt in here.
Make sure you shore it up good.

3
00:01:24,392 --> 00:01:27,760
It's like working inside a cow down here.

4
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:33,558
Una vaca plata
that is going to pay off my ranch.

5
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:36,320
Your ranch.

6
00:01:36,403 --> 00:01:39,736
It's like a woman.
It's all you ever talk about.

7
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:42,907
Meanwhile, she's taking all your money.

8
00:01:42,993 --> 00:01:46,492
And you, you spend
all of your money on whiskey.

9
00:01:46,914 --> 00:01:49,404
- But you're going to miss me soon.
- (roaring)

10
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,788
(thud and muffled cry)

11
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:56,419
Victor?

12
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:09,515
Victor?

13
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:21,188
Jefe. Jefe.

14
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:23,688
Jefe, Victor is gone.

15
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:27,614
- What do you mean, "gone"?
- We were working the face.

16
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:30,194
I know he couldn't have got past me.

17
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,493
- But now he's just gone.
- (roaring)

18
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:35,743
Jefe! Jefe!

19
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,085
Aaaaargh!

20
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:44,045
Dammit.

21
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:50,255
(miner) Juan! Where are ya?

22
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:53,842
(thuds and miners screaming)

23
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:22,351
So many people leaving.

24
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:25,726
Is everyone rejecting us?

25
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,734
No, Fu Yien. They are leaving
because the mine is closed.

26
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:34,816
Maybe we need a different name.

27
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:41,077
- Perhaps it was not the best choice, huh?
- Maybe not.

28
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:43,207
Son...

29
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:04,891
Juan Pedilla, you've been looking at that
hat for a month. Buy it or don't buy it.

30
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:07,105
No, no. I can't afford it.

31
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:09,352
You take it on credit. Pay us later.

32
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:11,319
No credit!

33
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:14,323
Stan Kelton is leaving.
Loading up his wagon.

34
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:18,702
Stan too? Now we're a town
without a blacksmith.

35
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:22,656
It'll end up as a ghost town
if that mine doesn't reopen.

36
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:25,455
If everybody leaves,
who will buy our things?

37
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:28,830
No one.
And we'll go back to China.

38
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:33,253
Only way you going back to China
is if you learn how to swim.

39
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:38,841
What does I Ching say?

40
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:42,681
"Expect arrival of great conqueror."

41
00:05:43,188 --> 00:05:44,812
(clicking)

42
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:58,529
The mine will not stay closed. That ore is
turning out a hundred ounces to the ton.

43
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:01,703
- Two hundred, my friend.
- Two hundred?

44
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:05,656
Well, nobody's walking away
from riches like that.

45
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:07,542
Nobody.

46
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:11,756
Well, if you saw what I saw,
you might walk away.

47
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,758
You never really told us what you saw.

48
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:17,002
I saw nothing.

49
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:21,010
But the nothing, it was worse
than anything I have ever seen.

50
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,935
You're not thinking of pulling out too?

51
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:26,177
No, I cannot do that.

52
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:29,687
- I would lose everything, like you.
- Like all of us.

53
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:32,526
Listen. It's about the mine.

54
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:36,940
The owner of the mine is coming.
All the way from Philadelphia.

55
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:40,400
He say "Low profit
from mine unacceptable."

56
00:06:40,494 --> 00:06:42,866
"Proceeding with all dispatch."

57
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:47,332
"Will take matters into hand personally.
Signed, Hiram Gummer."

58
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,990
That's a real two-dollar name.

59
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:56,041
I'll wager he gets this thing solved faster
than a bee with a horse on its tail. Betcha.

60
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:25,612
The stage is coming! It's coming!

61
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:34,492
Tecopa! Miss Christine!
The stage, it's coming!

62
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:06,862
- What do you think he looks like?
- He's probably fat.

63
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,112
Rich people are always fat.

64
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,663
Oh, my word.

65
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:15,870
- Anybody in there?
- It's full of luggage.

66
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:26,920
- It's about time.
- Indeed it is.

67
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:29,303
- Let me in.
- Can't wait to leave this place.

68
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:31,385
(speaks Chinese)

69
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,766
No one got out.

70
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,989
Mr. Hiram Gummer?

71
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,127
I am he.

72
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:02,796
I am Tsang Pyong Lien.
Pyong Chang.

73
00:09:02,884 --> 00:09:05,671
This is my market.

74
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:08,134
- You're not very fat.
- Quiet!

75
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:09,502
Whooee.

76
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:13,928
You must have enough money
to burn a wet mule, huh?

77
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,887
Mr. Gummer, I'm Christine Lord.
Proprietress of the local hotel.

78
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:20,270
You're lovelier than
Fifth Avenue in spring.

79
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,276
- Welcome to Rejection.
- Aptly named, it would seem.

80
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:28,985
I'm here to see Andrew Beckwith. I've sent
him three communiqués, all unanswered.

81
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:32,776
- I want to speak to him forthwith.
- That might prove difficult.

82
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,703
- Why? Where is he?
- On that. The last stage out of here.

83
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,665
Wh?

84
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:44,705
- That's just dandy. The last?
- Too few passengers.

85
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,011
The mine closed several weeks ago.
That is why you're here, isn't it?

86
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:55,347
Closed? The mine closed? I feel I've not
been privy to most needful information.

87
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:57,925
You don't know
what happens at the mine?

88
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:02,433
17 miners were killed in one day.
The workers abandoned it.

89
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:04,150
17? What on earth happened?

90
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,726
- No one knows.
- Must you speak in riddles?

91
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:11,033
- The only one who knows is Juan Pedilla.
- Then I must see him straightaway.

92
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:15,162
Well, he's out riding his land.
We expect him back shortly. Please.

93
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:19,078
You must be tired from your traveling.
Let me show you to the hotel.

94
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:23,828
Oh, very well.
Come, I'll need assistance with my kit.

95
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:31,793
This is our bank. Closed, of course.

96
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:36,430
Our blacksmith, also closed.

97
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:38,308
- And our post office.
- Closed.

98
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:41,809
- Of course.
- Quite the bustling metropolis.

99
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:46,560
(speaks Chinese)

100
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:51,278
- "Great conqueror".
- And this is my hotel. Welcome.

101
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:02,031
Right this way.

102
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,502
An impressive arsenal.
Are you a collector?

103
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:11,260
The miners came west to strike it rich.

104
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:16,929
When it came time to settle their bills,
many of them had only their firearms left.

105
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:22,686
- Now I collect payments daily.
- Nonsense. Just keep a running tab.

106
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,401
Your man is rather impudent.

107
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:32,689
Tecopa is not my "man". He is my friend.

108
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:43,659
But this is a tent.

109
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,240
Yes. You're observant.
Which would you like?

110
00:11:46,336 --> 00:11:50,001
This one right here.

111
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,545
Dandy.
What time will luncheon be served?

112
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:56,501
Well, since the mine has closed
the supply wagons have stopped,

113
00:11:56,596 --> 00:12:00,379
so our menu's a bit limited.
I could fix you a pot of beans.

114
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:07,356
Nonsense. Surely you have flour,
molasses and ginger?

115
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,852
I should like a gingerbread cake.
Yes, that should do nicely.

116
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:17,280
You want me to strangle him?

117
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,857
No, we need him.

118
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:24,616
(# piano)

119
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:33,417
Delightful music and a passable meal. Which
I should like to end with an aperitif.

120
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:35,795
Wouldn't we all?

121
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:40,676
Fu Yien, would you like
that last piece of gingerbread?

122
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:41,765
Yes.

123
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:46,184
Then go to my small carpet bag, the blue
one, and fetch my bottle of peach brandy.

124
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,345
Yes, sir.

125
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,668
- What happened to the gingerbread?
- I ate it, of course.

126
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:13,669
- But you said I could...
- A word of advice, young man.

127
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:19,093
Anyone can be taken advantage of,
and if you can, do.

128
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:26,465
That is terrible advice to give a child.

129
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,801
The boy must learn
the ways of the world.

130
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,564
I assure you, he knows them.

131
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:34,648
- Juan's here. He's over at the store.
- "Juan"?

132
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:37,770
Juan Pedilla, the miner.

133
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:40,317
Oh. Yes, yes.

134
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:45,240
No, no, no, no.
The mine is not played out. Not at all.

135
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:50,073
There's plenty more silver in there.
It's just no one wants to go in and get it.

136
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,617
Seven more men go up since accident.
None come back.

137
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:57,839
My ancestors talked of spirit beasts
that live inside those mountains.

138
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:59,086
"Spirit beasts"?

139
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:02,757
Beasts from the underworld.
Blind to all but killing.

140
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:04,339
(speaks Chinese)

141
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,929
Have you all taken leave of your senses?

142
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:14,553
Juan, gather up the remaining miners,
hunt down whatever is doing this...

143
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:19,441
And fill 'em full of more holes
than a cabbage leaf in a hailstorm.

144
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:20,607
Precisely.

145
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:26,282
Señor Gummer, there are some miners
camped north of town. I can talk to them.

146
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:31,954
But they are not going to go back unless
you pay them. Maybe even double wages.

147
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:38,458
- Pay them? To earn their own jobs back?
- I'm just telling you, they are scared.

148
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:44,051
Very well. To ensure my resources are not
squandered by this cabal of hooligans,

149
00:14:44,136 --> 00:14:47,386
I shall accompany you myself,
first thing in the morning.

150
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:53,011
Now you're talking. What kind of gun
did you bring? Betcha it's big and fancy.

151
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:55,475
I don't own a firearm.

152
00:14:57,774 --> 00:14:59,647
Yes?

153
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:12,282
This is the Wild West, Mr. Gummer.
You don't read the dime novels?

154
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:15,159
You see a bad guy,
you gotta smoke him up.

155
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:26,216
Señor Gummer, your horse is ready.

156
00:15:27,345 --> 00:15:29,420
Señor Gummer...

157
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:33,591
Morning.

158
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:41,806
Señor, it is a hard day's ride
over very rough country. Uh...

159
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:47,191
This is the cross-country model.
The horse can carry my kit. Off we go!

160
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:05,161
Deplorable road conditions.

161
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:10,086
Um...

162
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,177
No, no, I'd like some, uh...

163
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:16,598
Maybe just... Thank you.
Ah, very good.

164
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:25,230
I haven't been on a horse since I...
since my sixth birthday party.

165
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,892
No, actually, that was a camel.

166
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:36,159
- Mr. Gummer?
- Yes?

167
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,155
- This is for you.
- I beg your pardon?

168
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:42,292
This is the Wild West. Never go unarmed.

169
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,205
No, indeed, um...
Thank you, son. Thank you.

170
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,920
You really think
he is "great conqueror"?

171
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,682
Only if he rides a camel
better than he rides a horse.

172
00:16:55,765 --> 00:17:00,972
Let's not judge yet, Tecopa.
He's the only chance we have.

173
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,031
Howdy, gents.

174
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:39,673
- This is our army?
- These are the only ones willing to go.

175
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,059
All the better.
No need to waste my money on cowards.

176
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,230
Men, this is the patrón,
Mr. Hiram Gummer.

177
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,519
These are the Walter brothers,
Brick and Stony.

178
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,446
- This is Big Horse Johnson.
- Mr. Johnson.

179
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,818
And this is Soggy.

180
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,615
Soggy?

181
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,236
Indeed.

182
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,790
Well, in you go.

183
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,584
- And what?
- And report back to me.

184
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:23,933
Oh, very well.

185
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,719
As none of you possess
sufficient leadership skills,

186
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:31,432
I shall supervise the endeavor myself.
Juan?

187
00:18:33,611 --> 00:18:35,686
Vámonos.

188
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,219
- Wait.
- (Juan) That was our foreman.

189
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,592
My hat.

190
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:11,518
Urgh.

191
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,316
Here. He ain't gonna need it.

192
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:21,736
Try it on.

193
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,158
Thank you, jefe.

194
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:45,880
Oh, my.

195
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:57,400
This is the end of the mine,
where Victor was.

196
00:19:57,485 --> 00:20:01,233
Well, we're still alive.

197
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:05,486
Whatever attacked you,
it would seem to be gone.

198
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:17,504
Gentlemen,
I declare this mine perfectly safe.

199
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:20,376
Dang right.
Ain't nothin' in there but ghosts.

200
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,956
You don't need to pay them no wages.

201
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:25,756
I pray that we are correct.

202
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:36,015
Well, sun's gettin' low.
Might as well set up camp.

203
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:42,267
We can't camp here.

204
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:47,239
I need trees.

205
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:02,331
(chuckles)

206
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:07,844
It's better for the posture.

207
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:22,442
(plays discordantly)

208
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,735
Oh, damn.
You gonna start torturing that thing?

209
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:29,230
Helps me sleep.

210
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:35,615
- And the horses like it too.
- Well, go play it for them.

211
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,791
Ain't my fault you lack a musical ear.

212
00:21:51,473 --> 00:21:54,046
(Soggy plays concertina)

213
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,395
How soon do you think
you can reopen the mine?

214
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:02,428
Posthaste. The sooner the better.

215
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:04,149
Good.

216
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:09,229
Because I need to keep working
if I don't want to lose my ranch.

217
00:22:09,323 --> 00:22:11,778
I thought you were a miner.

218
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:18,665
Well, I am a miner, but my father always
dreamed of having a ranch for us one day.

219
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:20,456
And?

220
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:25,584
He was killed in a cave-in
when I was a boy.

221
00:22:25,673 --> 00:22:30,833
My mother, she moved us
from mining camp to mining camp.

222
00:22:30,928 --> 00:22:36,930
They always need a woman
to do the laundry and the cooking.

223
00:22:37,017 --> 00:22:39,768
I've been without my cook for weeks.

224
00:22:44,108 --> 00:22:47,559
You always had everything, didn't you?

225
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:50,190
Several of everything.

226
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,028
I'd just like to get one of something.

227
00:22:54,117 --> 00:22:57,485
- (thud and concertina stops)
- What on earth?

228
00:23:08,131 --> 00:23:11,796
Aw, damn.
We'll be hours finding them horses.

229
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:14,458
Soggy, you sorry sack!

230
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,720
- I'm gonna pound you blue!
- Easy, everybody.

231
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:25,056
You pound 'im, Brick!
Aw, he's always fartin' around.

232
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,979
Where the hell are you?

233
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:33,819
It won't do you no good hidin'!

234
00:23:33,907 --> 00:23:35,946
- ¡Cállate!
- (whoosh)

235
00:23:37,827 --> 00:23:40,614
You hear that?

236
00:23:40,705 --> 00:23:42,448
(Brick) Soggy!

237
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,158
- The longer I look, the madder I get!
- (whoosh)

238
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:47,959
- (thud)
- (Brick) Aaargh!

239
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:50,796
- Good Lord! What the?
- Tarnation!

240
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:53,837
(Brick screams)

241
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:57,172
Brick? You all right?

242
00:23:57,263 --> 00:24:00,382
Stony, don't you go
shooting blind out there!

243
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:03,055
(Stony) Brick!

244
00:24:03,144 --> 00:24:05,183
Well, where is he?

245
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:07,761
Don't know. He ain't out there.

246
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:09,932
(whoosh)

247
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:12,100
Who's there?

248
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:17,524
Who's over there?
We've got guns over here.

249
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:38,423
Wh... wh...

250
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:41,181
What in God's name?

251
00:24:44,392 --> 00:24:46,467
(whooshing)

252
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:49,643
(whistling)

253
00:25:04,996 --> 00:25:07,451
You gotta shoot faster! Kill them, man!

254
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:21,168
- We gotta get up somewhere!
- Where?

255
00:25:21,262 --> 00:25:23,587
Over on that rock!

256
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:36,644
Señor Gummer!
Over here on the rock! On the rock!

257
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:42,068
Big Horse! Over here!
You gotta get off the ground!

258
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,482
Big Horse! Here!

259
00:25:47,496 --> 00:25:51,956
- (Juan) No! Big Horse, you can't shoot it!
- (Gummer) This way, man! Quickly!

260
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:54,793
(Juan) Get on the rock!

261
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:57,834
(whoosh)

262
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:03,333
(Big Horse screaming)

263
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:28,357
Good heavens.

264
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,026
What a dreadful odor.

265
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,538
I smelled it in the mine.

266
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,627
It was them.

267
00:26:38,713 --> 00:26:41,630
They came up through the soft dirt.

268
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:44,503
At least it can't penetrate rock.

269
00:26:56,522 --> 00:26:59,191
(Gummer) It has no eyes.

270
00:27:02,612 --> 00:27:05,648
How did they find us?

271
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:23,043
It's the sound. Every time
we made a sound. Even your teapot.

272
00:27:23,132 --> 00:27:25,539
That's how they hunt.

273
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:33,303
We can't just stay here.

274
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:40,728
These foothills are made of rock. We can
walk on them all the way to Rejection.

275
00:27:40,816 --> 00:27:44,315
- Walk?
- Well, unless you can fly.

276
00:28:16,017 --> 00:28:18,768
Tecopa, what are you doing?

277
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:21,888
Diggin' a spot for a flagpole.

278
00:28:21,981 --> 00:28:27,319
A flagpole? Does it concern you
that Nevada hasn't yet adopted a flag?

279
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:31,068
We will one day. I'll be ready.

280
00:28:48,382 --> 00:28:53,458
They're back! They're back!
It's Juan and Mr. Gummer! They're back!

281
00:28:55,097 --> 00:28:57,670
I'd have walked twice that far to get away.

282
00:28:57,766 --> 00:29:00,719
Those are the most savagerous beasts
I've ever seen.

283
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:04,808
Well, didn't you let loose?
Let fly? Barrels blazing?

284
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:07,982
Old Fred, you don't understand.

285
00:29:08,068 --> 00:29:13,488
When they're not underground,
they're... flying. Very fast.

286
00:29:13,574 --> 00:29:14,984
(speaks Chinese)

287
00:29:15,075 --> 00:29:18,823
- Dragons. Dirt dragons.
- We never had them in China.

288
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:22,826
Big Horse, Juan -
they tried to shoot them but couldn't.

289
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:27,079
You'd have to be
an unparalleled shootist.

290
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,666
But wait, that's it. A telegram.
We must send a telegram immediately.

291
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:33,916
Let me do it. I know how.

292
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,089
Here.

293
00:29:35,178 --> 00:29:38,926
"Wanted - gunfighter."

294
00:29:39,015 --> 00:29:44,175
"Town of Rejection, Nevada,
seeks experienced quick-draw artist,

295
00:29:44,271 --> 00:29:46,940
calm in face of danger."

296
00:29:47,023 --> 00:29:49,430
"Salary negotiable."

297
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:54,602
Send that to the Territorial Enterprise,
the Denver Post and the Wichita Eagle.

298
00:29:54,697 --> 00:29:59,275
- You're going to hire a gunfighter?
- I think that is a good idea.

299
00:30:00,995 --> 00:30:05,324
But is it wise?
A gunfighter's usually mean, wild...

300
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:06,578
(speaks Chinese)

301
00:30:06,668 --> 00:30:08,874
Drink, shoot inside house...

302
00:30:08,961 --> 00:30:13,706
- But we need someone with fortitude.
- Someone with a little fan in their craw.

303
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,050
Exactly. Someone who is
proficient with firearms who can...

304
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:20,172
Shoot the nuts off a squirrel
at a hundred paces.

305
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:23,051
- Thank you.
- Someone like Doc Holliday.

306
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:28,516
- Except one that ain't dead.
- Doc Holliday's dead?

307
00:30:28,606 --> 00:30:31,143
OK, it's done.

308
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,723
Now we wait.

309
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:46,115
- Handsome, no?
- Oh, very.

310
00:30:46,206 --> 00:30:48,661
It's me.

311
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:51,288
Very few men have statues of themselves.

312
00:30:51,378 --> 00:30:54,165
A cigar-store Indian?

313
00:30:54,256 --> 00:30:58,502
Oh, a salesman gave that to me
when he couldn't pay his bill.

314
00:30:58,594 --> 00:31:01,927
Well, it could be me.

315
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:37,128
- Mr. Gummer, I fixed your wheel.
- Impossible, it's a complete loss.

316
00:31:37,215 --> 00:31:38,459
Nope.

317
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:49,426
Well, I... My, my, that's...

318
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,141
Remarkable. Um... Thank you.
Thank you very much.

319
00:31:57,235 --> 00:32:00,070
That'll be five dollars, please.

320
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:04,447
Now listen here. No workman
would dare ask more than two bits.

321
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:08,826
I'm the only wheel-fixer in town.
No one else till Carson City.

322
00:32:08,913 --> 00:32:12,957
- But that's highway robbery.
- A word of advice, Mr. Gummer.

323
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:17,288
Anyone can be taken advantage of.
And if you can, do.

324
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:32,475
Fu Yien, I'm a trifle short of cash
at present. May we barter instead?

325
00:32:33,729 --> 00:32:37,678
For services rendered,
you may have the bicycle.

326
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:40,774
It's yours.
I'm becoming quite the expert horseman.

327
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:43,268
Dandy, Mr. Gummer!

328
00:32:46,158 --> 00:32:48,233
There you go.

329
00:32:49,744 --> 00:32:51,701
No, um...
Oh, here, here, here, here.

330
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:54,029
I'll steady you. Get your balance.

331
00:32:54,124 --> 00:33:00,458
Now, when I push, press the pedals
and keep the front wheel straight. Ready?

332
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:02,373
Off you go.

333
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:11,180
Not bad.

334
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:18,057
Not bad at all.

335
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:30,908
(whistle blows)

336
00:33:40,378 --> 00:33:42,868
How long is this bedlam to last?

337
00:33:42,963 --> 00:33:46,960
Oh, a few more days.
We're deepening our well.

338
00:33:47,051 --> 00:33:51,594
We're quite proud of our engine. It's going
to run our electric lights one day.

339
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,057
- If you can abide the racket.
- The work would go faster if you'd help.

340
00:33:56,143 --> 00:34:00,306
A man of my means
doesn't engage in physical labor.

341
00:34:00,397 --> 00:34:02,769
Which brings us...

342
00:34:03,692 --> 00:34:05,980
to your bill.

343
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:10,987
- You're running a tab.
- I didn't agree to that.

344
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:17,278
Mrs. Lord, in any civilized place
my name alone is quite sufficient.

345
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:22,117
Well, out here in the rough-and-tumble
West, we tend to use cash.

346
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,958
That is a twenty-dollar gold piece
on your watch fob, isn't it?

347
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:29,131
And the watch itself is gold, of course?

348
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:33,048
And the cufflinks? Genuine diamonds?

349
00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:38,009
Are you proposing that I barter with you
as I would a street vendor in Calcutta?

350
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:40,770
Don't be absurd.
You will run a proper tab

351
00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:47,473
until this pathetic town has a proper bank
to which I can wire funds.

352
00:35:41,955 --> 00:35:46,083
Here, now. What is going on?
Why aren't you riding that wheel?

353
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:50,544
No time. I'm working.

354
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:53,548
You men will take forever.
Using a boy to do a man's work?

355
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:54,665
(speaks Chinese)

356
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,835
Very narrow down there.

357
00:35:56,928 --> 00:36:00,842
He's the only one
small enough to widen it.

358
00:36:01,975 --> 00:36:07,479
The moment it is wide enough, I expect
to see one of you down there in his place.

359
00:36:07,564 --> 00:36:10,351
And he back on that bicycle.

360
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:24,195
Mrs. Lord, I should like to apologize.

361
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:27,745
The truth is,

362
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:33,420
my coin, watch and cufflinks
are all I own in the world.

363
00:36:35,216 --> 00:36:37,623
I beg your pardon?

364
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:42,461
My father, in his final demented days,

365
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,011
sold all his holdings and invested
everything, the entire family fortune,

366
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:50,594
in a certain silver mine.

367
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,310
I see.

368
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:57,817
I was rude earlier. I apologize.

369
00:36:57,905 --> 00:37:01,320
Once I get the mine running,
I'll pay my bill in full

370
00:37:01,408 --> 00:37:04,492
and be on the first stage out of here.

371
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,616
(thunder)

372
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:25,636
As Old Fred would say,
that's a real gullywasher.

373
00:37:25,724 --> 00:37:29,223
Don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with it.

374
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:32,929
I hope Old Fred made it
to the muling station before this hit.

375
00:37:33,023 --> 00:37:36,391
Yesterday a desert, today a monsoon.

376
00:37:37,903 --> 00:37:41,686
Once I reopen the mine,
the whole town will prosper.

377
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:46,027
You'll be able to afford
whatever your hearts desire.

378
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:49,285
And what is it that your heart desires,
Mr. Gummer?

379
00:37:49,372 --> 00:37:51,660
To return to the life I had.

380
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:56,791
To wake up every morning and wonder
"What will I spend my money on today?"

381
00:37:59,841 --> 00:38:05,795
I'd venture it matters not how you spend
your money, but how you spend your life.

382
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:09,257
- Mr. Gummer?
- Don't interrupt your elders.

383
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:12,050
Never you mind, Miss Lord.

384
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:16,972
I'll amend my misspent life
when the Grim Reaper comes calling.

385
00:38:19,026 --> 00:38:21,018
(thunderclap)

386
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,458
I recommend that
you keep that hog leg skinned,

387
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:45,968
unless you got a desire to be
jumpin' over hot coals in hell.

388
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,011
And who might you be, sir?

389
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:54,591
- Kelly.
- "Black Hand" Kelly?

390
00:38:58,148 --> 00:39:01,232
I'm lookin' for Hiram Gummer.

391
00:39:03,528 --> 00:39:05,734
That would be me.

392
00:39:05,822 --> 00:39:09,736
- You posted yourself an advertisement?
- I did. Yes, I did.

393
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:13,823
So who do you want me to kill?
That Injun over there?

394
00:39:13,914 --> 00:39:14,945
No, no, no, no.

395
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,536
It's not so much a "who" as a "what".

396
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:26,580
They spring from the ground like, uh...
like some demonic trout.

397
00:39:26,676 --> 00:39:29,676
We call them "dirt dragons".

398
00:39:30,722 --> 00:39:35,015
This stuff sure must be
a whole lot stronger than it tastes.

399
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:41,352
We're well aware that it sounds fantastic,
but we can assure you it's all quite true.

400
00:39:44,694 --> 00:39:49,818
- They're ferocious and fast.
- It takes real backbone to face 'em down.

401
00:39:49,907 --> 00:39:54,070
Amigo, I like to fight with rattlesnakes
just for the fun of it,

402
00:39:54,162 --> 00:39:57,661
and I give 'em first bite to boot.

403
00:39:57,748 --> 00:40:02,409
Hyperbole aside,
you are accurate with a firearm?

404
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:06,915
- Questioning my abilities, sir?
- As an astute businessman, I'm simply...

405
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:09,166
Hey, boy!

406
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:14,217
- Toss me one of them apples over here.
- See, I knew it. Shoot inside house.

407
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:18,975
- Throw it high?
- No, no, no.

408
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:22,227
- You throw it right straight at me.
- OK.

409
00:40:22,314 --> 00:40:25,647
- You ready?
- Anytime.

410
00:40:37,412 --> 00:40:40,365
- What?
- We thought you shoot apple.

411
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:44,157
Obviously we were expecting
to see a demonstration of...

412
00:41:03,813 --> 00:41:05,722
You're hired.

413
00:41:05,815 --> 00:41:09,183
- In China, no one shoots in wall.
- In China, no one has gun.

414
00:41:09,277 --> 00:41:17,277
Before I sign up for anything, talk to me
about that "salary negotiable" part.

415
00:41:19,162 --> 00:41:22,910
Do you like silver, Mr. Kelly?

416
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:24,706
I reckon I do.

417
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:27,995
Upon dispatching all the
aforementioned creatures,

418
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:31,586
and upon the reopening of the mine,
you'll be paid in silver.

419
00:41:31,674 --> 00:41:35,885
Say, um... as much as you can carry
on a strong horse?

420
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:42,636
Well, now, I just bet that you could
charm a cow right out of her calf

421
00:41:42,727 --> 00:41:45,134
with those fancy words.

422
00:41:45,229 --> 00:41:50,471
But now, for myself, I sorta need
a little something up front.

423
00:41:52,236 --> 00:41:54,608
We don't have any money.

424
00:41:58,242 --> 00:42:00,199
Ah, well.

425
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:02,859
Thank you for your time.

426
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:14,208
Double eagle.

427
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,872
A down payment.

428
00:42:22,683 --> 00:42:27,925
Tell you what. You throw in
them there cufflinks and, uh...

429
00:42:28,021 --> 00:42:30,938
you got yourself a deal.

430
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:58,749
This is one sorry collection
of lead pushers you got here.

431
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:01,464
I'm not running a gun store, Mr. Kelly.

432
00:43:03,556 --> 00:43:07,339
Juan, you take this here big old 45-70.

433
00:43:07,435 --> 00:43:12,809
Hiram, pick yourself out
something that feels right in your hand.

434
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:19,815
And you give us all these
blue whistlers that you got.

435
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,071
Juan.

436
00:43:24,243 --> 00:43:28,157
- Take this.
- Oh, pero no. I still can't afford it.

437
00:43:28,247 --> 00:43:31,746
No credit. It's a gift.

438
00:43:33,836 --> 00:43:36,753
Gracias.

439
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:38,249
What?

440
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,340
No one goes without a hat in China.

441
00:43:41,427 --> 00:43:44,131
OK, boys, let's jingle some spurs.

442
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:48,384
No. No. No spurs.
In fact, no jingling of any kind.

443
00:44:24,636 --> 00:44:28,419
I tell you, these things are attracted
by the slightest noise.

444
00:44:28,515 --> 00:44:32,133
They could leap from the ground
at any moment.

445
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,437
Juan killed one right here.

446
00:44:59,211 --> 00:45:01,286
Shh, shh, shh.

447
00:45:17,563 --> 00:45:19,851
Cuídate, señor.

448
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,059
There ain't nothin' here neither.

449
00:45:24,194 --> 00:45:26,767
Maybe they gone deaf.

450
00:45:28,365 --> 00:45:32,232
Or maybe you two boys
are playing me for the fool.

451
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:35,031
After what I paid you?

452
00:45:37,582 --> 00:45:42,789
- We will just have to keep looking.
- Juan, if you please, some help.

453
00:45:45,757 --> 00:45:49,505
Gummer, dag nab it,
ain't you got no pride?

454
00:45:49,594 --> 00:45:52,298
Get up on the horse by yourself!

455
00:45:53,348 --> 00:45:58,342
Should I ever again require horsemanship,
I will engage a tutor.

456
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:05,609
Well, I'll tell you one thing. I ain't got
your book-learning, but I know this:

457
00:46:05,693 --> 00:46:09,061
Being full-growed don't make you a man.

458
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:22,326
(Juan) Look, look, look, look.

459
00:46:23,544 --> 00:46:25,619
Here, here.

460
00:46:33,721 --> 00:46:37,718
They appear to be... shells. Eggs.

461
00:46:38,893 --> 00:46:41,810
Well, if that's what they are...

462
00:46:44,231 --> 00:46:47,564
then they came out of one big chicken.

463
00:46:48,694 --> 00:46:53,984
Or maybe you two aren't as crazy
as I've been thinking.

464
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:59,408
This is where we pipe
the hot spring from the mine.

465
00:46:59,496 --> 00:47:04,738
The water cut through the dirt, you see?
And the eggs fell out.

466
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:07,919
Perhaps the warm water hatched them.

467
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:11,539
Juan, this tells us how many there are.

468
00:47:12,092 --> 00:47:14,796
There are four. And I killed one already.

469
00:47:14,886 --> 00:47:17,886
- Three left.
- But where could they have gone?

470
00:47:17,973 --> 00:47:21,970
Well, we're just gonna keep on ridin'
till we find them,

471
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:27,932
cos I'm gettin' awful anxious
to unravel me some cartridges.

472
00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:37,405
(Juan) We piped that hot water out
only six months ago.

473
00:47:37,492 --> 00:47:41,655
(Gummer) Then those creatures
grew large quite quickly.

474
00:47:49,629 --> 00:47:55,334
That's a part of one of them.
These scaly things were on their backs.

475
00:47:58,346 --> 00:48:01,512
Yeah? Well...

476
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,928
Maybe one of them there "things" died.

477
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:10,895
Or maybe... maybe he shed his skin,
like a snake.

478
00:48:10,983 --> 00:48:13,770
Who is that?

479
00:48:17,198 --> 00:48:21,326
It's Old Fred. At least, that's his wagon.

480
00:48:29,543 --> 00:48:31,998
(Gummer) Good Lord.

481
00:48:32,087 --> 00:48:34,791
This does not bode well.

482
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:50,597
Now, that is one
catawampussly chawed-up rig.

483
00:48:50,689 --> 00:48:55,481
As I keep say... saying,
these things are not to be trifled with.

484
00:48:56,695 --> 00:48:58,770
Old Fred?

485
00:49:01,783 --> 00:49:03,858
Old Fred?

486
00:49:06,663 --> 00:49:08,738
Old Fred?

487
00:49:46,452 --> 00:49:49,025
Maybe we should have made it longer.

488
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:52,240
Well, I'm not totin' no more rocks.

489
00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:58,501
- We should say something.
- I didn't even know the man.

490
00:49:58,589 --> 00:50:01,162
Take off your hat.

491
00:50:06,263 --> 00:50:09,678
Fred was an old man.

492
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:13,218
That is why we called him Old Fred.

493
00:50:14,354 --> 00:50:17,224
He drove the freight.

494
00:50:17,316 --> 00:50:21,099
He had bad breath.
But I don't want to say that.

495
00:50:21,195 --> 00:50:23,602
All right. All right.

496
00:50:27,034 --> 00:50:29,987
"Fear no more the heat o' the sun,

497
00:50:30,078 --> 00:50:33,363
Nor the furious winter's rages."

498
00:50:33,457 --> 00:50:36,790
"Thou thy worldly task hast done,

499
00:50:37,461 --> 00:50:40,331
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages."

500
00:50:42,632 --> 00:50:44,920
Cymbeline. Act four, scene two.

501
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:47,216
We'd best get going.

502
00:50:47,304 --> 00:50:50,803
- Wait. Let's make camp here.
- No, we'll go to the ridge.

503
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:54,175
Camp on solid rock.
As we have every night.

504
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:58,218
Oh, no. That is three miles back there.
That's hard country.

505
00:50:58,314 --> 00:51:01,517
If you think I'd risk
sleeping on the naked earth...

506
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:06,105
We could go down to the muling station.
Down the canyon.

507
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:07,904
- Is it safe?
- Yes.

508
00:51:07,991 --> 00:51:13,863
There are thick beams on the floor for the
wagons. The dragons can't break through.

509
00:51:32,473 --> 00:51:35,473
- Might there be someone here?
- No.

510
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,931
They stopped the supply wagons
now that...

511
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,685
Now that the mine is closed.
The bitter refrain of my life, it seems.

512
00:51:41,774 --> 00:51:46,317
We must secure these horses with
certainty. The last time, they got away.

513
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:50,352
You just make sure
that gate is tied up tight.

514
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:29,520
Mr. Kelly!

515
00:52:31,865 --> 00:52:37,404
You can't see the door
if you're facing this direction.

516
00:52:37,495 --> 00:52:40,199
Always be prepared.

517
00:53:05,606 --> 00:53:07,681
(snores)

518
00:53:40,807 --> 00:53:42,633
(snores loudly)

519
00:53:42,726 --> 00:53:45,133
Aaargh! ¡Sálvame, Dios!

520
00:53:45,228 --> 00:53:46,722
(shrieking)

521
00:53:49,483 --> 00:53:52,152
What in God's name?

522
00:54:02,537 --> 00:54:04,909
- So was that them?
- No.

523
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:07,867
No.

524
00:54:07,959 --> 00:54:10,829
Something new.

525
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,995
(cartridges clink)

526
00:54:14,507 --> 00:54:15,965
(shrieking)

527
00:54:20,054 --> 00:54:21,761
(feeble bang)

528
00:54:25,852 --> 00:54:28,177
You said to pick one
I was comfortable with.

529
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:32,517
You're right. I did say that.

530
00:54:32,608 --> 00:54:34,481
(sniffs)

531
00:54:35,403 --> 00:54:39,103
What in Sam Hill is that smell?

532
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:43,523
It's them. That's the smell.
Remember, señor?

533
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:47,402
But they've changed so.
Become long and thin.

534
00:54:47,498 --> 00:54:50,498
There's six of them,

535
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:52,493
or even nine.

536
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,875
We'd better bring the horses inside.

537
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:59,175
¡Chingada!

538
00:54:59,259 --> 00:55:01,381
They're gone! Again!

539
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:06,881
We can't go on foot.
They'll get us for sure.

540
00:55:06,975 --> 00:55:10,141
All right. All right.

541
00:55:10,229 --> 00:55:14,178
That means we have to
stand our ground here.

542
00:55:14,274 --> 00:55:19,315
Hiram, it's about time you learned
how to use a real piece.

543
00:55:19,404 --> 00:55:23,615
That's your job.
If I need a gun fired, I hire a gunman.

544
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,819
If you want to bed down
with a real pretty woman,

545
00:55:26,912 --> 00:55:29,829
I s'pose you just
hire somebody to do that too.

546
00:55:29,915 --> 00:55:32,915
Spare me your tiresome analogies.

547
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:34,199
Hiram.

548
00:55:34,294 --> 00:55:38,208
Now, I said this once,
and I'm gonna say it one more time.

549
00:55:38,298 --> 00:55:44,834
There are some things a man has to do for
himself, and right now shootin' is one.

550
00:55:44,929 --> 00:55:50,634
And give me that stupid hideout piece.
It ain't gonna do you no good now.

551
00:55:55,148 --> 00:56:00,438
OK, Juan, you keep your eye peeled
for them there snake things.

552
00:56:00,528 --> 00:56:05,485
Pay attention, Hiram.
Now, this is a single-action Colt Army.

553
00:56:05,575 --> 00:56:08,908
This is the finest wheel gun ever made.

554
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:14,323
Don't be holdin' it like it's some skunk.

555
00:56:14,417 --> 00:56:20,087
Now, it's an extension of your hand, OK?
It's part of you.

556
00:56:20,172 --> 00:56:23,457
- And take a stance, like you mean it.
- Mean what?

557
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:27,928
Like you mean that every last lead plum
that comes out of that barrel

558
00:56:28,013 --> 00:56:30,586
is gonna kill whatever you aim at.

559
00:56:30,683 --> 00:56:35,226
OK. OK. Take yourself a shot
at that can over there by the window.

560
00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:38,645
You line up this blade with this notch

561
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:43,393
then you just squeeze the trigger.
You don't jerk it.

562
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:51,115
(rumbling and creaking)

563
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:59,788
It's all right. They cannot
break through the floor beams.

564
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:06,841
Now, you just relax, you just let your eyes,
your brain, your hand, your trigger finger,

565
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:09,596
all becomes one.

566
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:15,297
(rumbling)

567
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:17,644
(rumbling continues)

568
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:20,398
It's all right.
You got consistency now.

569
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:24,431
- This is a waste of time!
- What do you expect?

570
00:57:24,527 --> 00:57:28,192
You wanna learn in 20 minutes
what took me 20 years?

571
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:02,389
They cannot break through the floor,
so they are tearing it apart.

572
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:04,936
How could a snake be so strong?

573
00:58:05,025 --> 00:58:07,100
(whoosh)

574
00:58:10,864 --> 00:58:15,193
- Look at that. They decoyed us.
- Good Lord. How smart are they?

575
00:58:15,285 --> 00:58:19,745
Está malo. We're gonna have
nothing left to stand on.

576
00:58:22,084 --> 00:58:25,417
- Telegraph?
- It is no good for us.

577
00:58:25,504 --> 00:58:30,628
- We don't know the clicking code.
- Click anything. Someone will hear us.

578
00:58:47,234 --> 00:58:49,724
(Fu Yien) I don't know what it is.
It's not Morse.

579
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:52,606
(Christine) It's been going on
for more than an hour?

580
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:56,908
Maybe a tree is touching the wire.
That happened before.

581
00:58:56,993 --> 00:58:58,535
This is different.

582
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:04,989
The telegrapher at Carson City wouldn't
allow foolishness with his equipment.

583
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:09,496
- Maybe not Carson City.
- Not Carson City? Where else?

584
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:21,508
This is from Carson City.

585
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:31,560
Where's that one from?

586
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:38,778
This is from the muling station. It must be
Mr. Gummer. He's the only one out there.

587
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:42,319
- When will Tecopa and Pyong be back?
- One, two days.

588
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:44,868
Gone upcountry. Getting firewood.

589
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:48,076
All right then. I'll go myself.

590
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:54,966
Must you tap so loudly?

591
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,339
(creature roaring)

592
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,430
Let your lead fly, man!

593
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,771
(shrieking)

594
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,207
(creature roaring and howling)

595
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:50,471
What the hell are we up against?

596
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:53,136
They... they grew.

597
01:00:54,233 --> 01:01:00,271
Those snakes are not snakes.
They are tongues. Three tongues!

598
01:01:00,364 --> 01:01:05,072
- Each creature has three tongues.
- And we saw nine before.

599
01:01:05,786 --> 01:01:11,906
- So there's still only three animals.
- That's supposed to make me feel better?

600
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,950
Good God, man, those things are
the size of eight-mule freight wagons!

601
01:01:16,046 --> 01:01:21,550
- Well, shoot them, like you're hired to do!
- You got to know your enemy, Hiram!

602
01:01:22,469 --> 01:01:27,463
I oughta be totin' some eight-bore
firin' solid shot.

603
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:31,935
Or some damn punt gun.
Not these weapons I got.

604
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:40,276
All right. All right.

605
01:01:40,362 --> 01:01:43,730
I tell ya what we're gonna do.
We're gonna... we're gonna...

606
01:01:43,824 --> 01:01:46,611
We're gonna hold our fire
till they come after us.

607
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:52,372
And then... and then we're gonna go
toe to toe, point blank, full bore,

608
01:01:52,457 --> 01:01:54,829
throw all the lead we got at 'em.

609
01:01:54,918 --> 01:01:59,496
And then maybe we'll get a... a lucky hit.

610
01:01:59,589 --> 01:02:01,996
A brain shot or something.

611
01:02:23,404 --> 01:02:28,943
- There is not much floor left.
- They'll be makin' their move anytime.

612
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:37,287
Get ready.

613
01:02:37,376 --> 01:02:40,293
This may be it.

614
01:02:40,379 --> 01:02:42,454
(rumbling)

615
01:02:43,758 --> 01:02:45,417
(crash)

616
01:02:57,938 --> 01:03:01,472
Now what are they up to?

617
01:03:08,198 --> 01:03:10,570
Oh, no!

618
01:03:10,659 --> 01:03:12,283
Mr. Kelly!

619
01:03:15,914 --> 01:03:18,369
Eat this!

620
01:03:59,165 --> 01:04:00,540
I'm out! I'm out!

621
01:04:01,793 --> 01:04:04,330
Christine is coming, Señor Gummer!

622
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,079
Christine! Over here!

623
01:04:19,936 --> 01:04:21,975
Just drive the wagon!

624
01:04:22,063 --> 01:04:26,523
- (Christine) Where's Mr. Kelly?
- (Juan) Dead. Go on! Go on! Go!

625
01:04:31,363 --> 01:04:34,731
Well done, Mrs. Lord!
Are they following us?

626
01:04:34,825 --> 01:04:36,449
I can't tell.

627
01:04:41,832 --> 01:04:43,789
Yes, they are following us.

628
01:04:43,876 --> 01:04:45,868
(roaring)

629
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:47,075
Faster!

630
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:52,339
- They're at their limit. Hyah! Come on!
- We shall see.

631
01:05:01,101 --> 01:05:02,974
(horse whinnies)

632
01:05:12,028 --> 01:05:14,863
(snarling)

633
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:23,616
They're enormous. Ravenous.

634
01:05:23,707 --> 01:05:29,496
"Spirit demons from dark places,
eating souls that live in the light."

635
01:05:31,548 --> 01:05:33,955
Part of our legend.

636
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:37,715
We put bullet after bullet into them.
It didn't even slow them down.

637
01:05:37,804 --> 01:05:39,048
(speaks Chinese)

638
01:05:39,138 --> 01:05:42,091
Will they come here? To our town?

639
01:05:42,183 --> 01:05:46,227
They'd have to get through the pass.
Lots of rocks. Maybe they cannot do it.

640
01:05:46,312 --> 01:05:50,641
It hardly matters.
The mine will remain unapproachable.

641
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:54,987
So what is your intention?

642
01:05:55,071 --> 01:05:59,732
My intention is to leave this godforsaken
place, as should all of you.

643
01:05:59,825 --> 01:06:01,449
But the mine...

644
01:06:01,535 --> 01:06:05,995
Are you listening?
The mine is lost. Forget the mine.

645
01:06:06,082 --> 01:06:12,120
Go on with your lives as if it never existed.
Start your lives over, just as I will have to.

646
01:06:12,213 --> 01:06:15,546
No stupid animal
is going to make me leave my land.

647
01:06:15,633 --> 01:06:18,717
I'll go to Carson City,
get some blasting powder.

648
01:06:18,802 --> 01:06:21,375
Juan, we were lucky. Dumb lucky.

649
01:06:21,472 --> 01:06:27,177
If a man like Black Hand Kelly is no match
for them, what chance do we have?

650
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:32,476
Pyong, why would you stay? Take
Fu Yien and the missis back to China.

651
01:06:33,483 --> 01:06:35,771
Lu Wan forgets.

652
01:06:38,113 --> 01:06:41,446
China not perfect. No place perfect.

653
01:06:43,243 --> 01:06:46,279
We will not leave our new home.

654
01:06:59,384 --> 01:07:05,967
I'll send for my belongings, and see that
the horse and equipment are returned.

655
01:07:06,057 --> 01:07:09,057
That won't be necessary.
You can keep the horse,

656
01:07:09,143 --> 01:07:13,057
and the saddle and the rifle
and the knife.

657
01:07:13,147 --> 01:07:16,266
In trade for ownership of the mine.

658
01:07:16,359 --> 01:07:20,487
- You can't be serious.
- It's the best offer you're gonna get.

659
01:07:21,614 --> 01:07:25,943
When I reach Philadelphia, I intend
to sell that mine for at least $50,000.

660
01:07:26,035 --> 01:07:28,822
You will be preceded by a telegram
to the newspapers

661
01:07:28,913 --> 01:07:35,081
describing in detail the creatures plaguing
the mine, and why it is unworkable.

662
01:07:36,045 --> 01:07:38,796
That's blackmail.
You wouldn't betray me like that.

663
01:07:38,881 --> 01:07:41,253
We voted.

664
01:07:41,342 --> 01:07:43,714
Four to one in favor
of doing exactly that.

665
01:07:43,803 --> 01:07:47,136
At least one of you
has some sense of ethics.

666
01:07:47,223 --> 01:07:50,058
I voted to drop you off a cliff.

667
01:07:50,517 --> 01:07:54,016
Stay with us, Hiram. Stay and fight.

668
01:07:55,564 --> 01:07:58,315
You're wasting your lives.

669
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:07,198
You can have the cursed mine.

670
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:18,085
Whoa. Whoa.

671
01:08:19,004 --> 01:08:22,669
Mr. Gummer, please don't leave us.

672
01:08:27,554 --> 01:08:29,676
Fu...

673
01:08:29,764 --> 01:08:32,433
Fu Yien, I can't help you.

674
01:10:21,374 --> 01:10:24,577
¡Madre de Dios. Hyah! Hyah!

675
01:10:54,031 --> 01:10:56,356
We were wrong. They're coming.

676
01:10:58,202 --> 01:11:02,033
The dirt dragons, they got through
the upper valley pass.

677
01:11:02,122 --> 01:11:05,158
I don't know when,
but they are definitely coming.

678
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:07,539
Maybe they not find us, keep going south.

679
01:11:07,628 --> 01:11:10,118
No, no, no, no. They hunt by sound.

680
01:11:10,214 --> 01:11:14,045
We are the only thing making noise
between here and Carson City.

681
01:11:14,134 --> 01:11:16,671
What do the sticks say?

682
01:11:16,762 --> 01:11:18,505
(speaks Chinese)

683
01:11:18,597 --> 01:11:21,882
"Expect a ferocious arrival."

684
01:11:24,436 --> 01:11:27,804
Well, this is it, then.

685
01:11:29,608 --> 01:11:32,312
The end of Rejection.

686
01:11:36,948 --> 01:11:38,821
(train whistle)

687
01:11:49,669 --> 01:11:55,873
One ticket for your next train
to Philadelphia. Sleeping car.

688
01:11:55,967 --> 01:11:59,003
- One way.
- Yes, sir.

689
01:11:59,095 --> 01:12:01,170
(Morse code)

690
01:12:06,811 --> 01:12:08,554
Fools.

691
01:12:08,646 --> 01:12:12,228
- I beg your pardon?
- The people up in Rejection.

692
01:12:12,316 --> 01:12:17,108
Funnier than a dancing bear, eh?
Here's one they sent yesterday.

693
01:12:17,196 --> 01:12:20,446
"Giant worms have left upper valley."

694
01:12:20,533 --> 01:12:22,940
- "May find town."
- May I?

695
01:12:23,035 --> 01:12:27,992
"Need immediate help."
(laughs) "Giant worms."

696
01:12:30,793 --> 01:12:32,951
One ticket.

697
01:12:33,045 --> 01:12:34,669
Sir? Your ticket?

698
01:13:17,464 --> 01:13:23,217
I was thinkin' I could make a sled for it.
We could pull it behind the last wagon.

699
01:13:23,303 --> 01:13:25,378
There's no room.

700
01:13:26,222 --> 01:13:28,795
Time to let it go.

701
01:13:40,153 --> 01:13:42,026
Juan, where will you go?

702
01:13:42,113 --> 01:13:48,696
There is a new strike down near Tonopah.
I'm thinking of heading that way.

703
01:13:48,786 --> 01:13:51,490
Where will we go?

704
01:13:51,581 --> 01:13:56,326
- We are going to San Francisco.
- And then back to China.

705
01:13:57,378 --> 01:14:01,422
All our money is put in the store,
and now it's all gone.

706
01:14:01,507 --> 01:14:06,963
And you are not going to work on
the rail road like momma and poppa.

707
01:14:09,807 --> 01:14:12,214
They're coming!

708
01:14:18,524 --> 01:14:21,727
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

709
01:14:21,819 --> 01:14:25,899
They will come from the north,
not from the south.

710
01:14:25,989 --> 01:14:29,607
That is something else... or someone.

711
01:14:49,262 --> 01:14:51,966
What poor soul
would be coming here now?

712
01:15:00,482 --> 01:15:01,892
It's Mr. Gummer!

713
01:15:06,071 --> 01:15:08,110
Come on! Whoa!

714
01:15:12,035 --> 01:15:13,778
"A ferocious arrival"?

715
01:15:23,463 --> 01:15:28,919
Well, now, maybe I'll
let you keep him after all.

716
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:34,596
Stop! Whoa, curse you! Whoa! Whoa!

717
01:15:35,182 --> 01:15:37,886
Whoa, you intransigent beasts!

718
01:15:37,977 --> 01:15:41,808
- Delighted to see you're all well.
- Hiram, they could be here any minute!

719
01:15:41,897 --> 01:15:43,936
- I know.
- Whatever are you thinking?

720
01:15:44,025 --> 01:15:49,860
That this idyllic Western retreat shall not
fall prey to these mindless predators.

721
01:15:49,947 --> 01:15:56,779
I have a cache of weapons that would
impress even the late Black Hand Kelly.

722
01:15:56,870 --> 01:16:00,950
One Sharps.52-calibre buffalo rifle.

723
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:07,082
One Remington 45-120 Rolling Block.

724
01:16:08,382 --> 01:16:14,135
One Henry repeating rifle. Smaller caliber,
but impressive rate of fire.

725
01:16:15,138 --> 01:16:18,138
One eight-gauge Remington... um...

726
01:16:19,267 --> 01:16:20,465
derringer.

727
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:26,349
One LC Smith ten-gauge
stub twist coach gun.

728
01:16:26,441 --> 01:16:29,276
And this.

729
01:16:29,361 --> 01:16:33,109
A two-inch-bore punt gun.

730
01:16:36,326 --> 01:16:40,703
Hiram, how did you get all of these
things? You don't have any money.

731
01:16:46,586 --> 01:16:50,714
A wise friend once told me it's not
important how you spend your money,

732
01:16:50,798 --> 01:16:53,798
but how you spend your life.

733
01:16:54,636 --> 01:16:59,214
Hiram Gummer, what is it
you think we are going to do? Hm?

734
01:16:59,307 --> 01:17:05,973
Madam, I intend we throw our visitors
a little corpse-and-cartridge occasion.

735
01:17:07,231 --> 01:17:12,438
That we stand our ground and
fight these despicable beasts to the death!

736
01:17:15,781 --> 01:17:18,817
(speaks Chinese)

737
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:21,613
We will fight!

738
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:23,246
Right.

739
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:25,903
(both speak Chinese)

740
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,880
It takes me two years to make you
leave China. You think I want to go back?

741
01:17:32,965 --> 01:17:35,123
- We do it.
- We'll stomp 'em like snakes.

742
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:37,707
- We will burn them down.
- We'll smoke 'em up!

743
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:43,382
Ah, Juan. Knowing you,
you'll need a spare.

744
01:17:45,436 --> 01:17:47,761
Gracias, amigo.

745
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,978
They'll probably be coming
from the north or the northeast.

746
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:59,278
Then we go out there and shoot them.

747
01:17:59,366 --> 01:18:02,450
Too dangerous.
They can come up anywhere.

748
01:18:02,536 --> 01:18:04,611
We dare not face them on their terms.

749
01:18:04,704 --> 01:18:08,369
- Stake a horse. When they go for it...
- Tecopa, that's cruel.

750
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:11,708
Well, these are cruel times.

751
01:18:11,795 --> 01:18:15,246
Can't we make noise
with something else?

752
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:19,752
That is a good idea, Fuito.
Any noise works.

753
01:18:19,844 --> 01:18:24,221
It doesn't have to be a horse. We could
make noise on something like this.

754
01:18:24,307 --> 01:18:26,976
Then when they come up, we shoot them.

755
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:30,927
Yes, an ambush. We will
lead them into our very gun muzzles.

756
01:18:31,022 --> 01:18:35,233
We will make Rejection our last bastion,
our last line of defense.

757
01:18:35,318 --> 01:18:39,564
- Our Alamo.
- Juan, we were the losers at the Alamo.

758
01:18:39,655 --> 01:18:42,572
Speak for yourself, gringo.

759
01:18:51,042 --> 01:18:54,327
More cans. I need more cans.

760
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:57,871
- I'm eating as fast as I can.
- (speaks Chinese)

761
01:18:59,133 --> 01:19:01,754
(speaks Chinese)
What is all this?

762
01:19:01,844 --> 01:19:06,221
When they come, how do we know
they come? We cannot see them.

763
01:19:06,307 --> 01:19:10,850
- Well, that is a concern.
- When the ground shakes...

764
01:19:10,936 --> 01:19:13,640
we know they are here.

765
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:15,721
Dandy.

766
01:19:24,116 --> 01:19:26,108
What is a punt gun?

767
01:19:26,201 --> 01:19:30,447
Something to do with shooting ducks.
A great many ducks.

768
01:19:30,539 --> 01:19:34,322
"Pour in one pound of shot or balls.
Ram it down tight..."

769
01:19:34,418 --> 01:19:36,493
Yup! Hyah!

770
01:19:47,013 --> 01:19:51,425
Won't we need the horses?
I mean, if we lose the fight?

771
01:19:51,518 --> 01:19:55,895
Can't have them making
unnecessary noise. Might spoil our trap.

772
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,601
And we're not going to lose, Fuito.

773
01:20:40,983 --> 01:20:43,556
Shall we begin?

774
01:22:08,152 --> 01:22:10,524
Maybe we should try again tomorrow.

775
01:22:10,613 --> 01:22:15,737
Perhaps Pyong was right. Perhaps
they've bypassed us for Carson City.

776
01:22:15,826 --> 01:22:17,617
I don't know.

777
01:22:17,703 --> 01:22:21,949
The ridge at the south end of the valley
is all rock, like a big wall.

778
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:26,584
- I don't think they can get past it.
- They gotta be somewhere.

779
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:28,792
(jangling)

780
01:22:37,639 --> 01:22:41,719
- No! Fu, get inside!
- (speaks Chinese)

781
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:45,677
- But I want to fight too!
- Fu, Fu.

782
01:22:45,772 --> 01:22:51,477
The store is our fort.
We can't ever leave the fort unguarded.

783
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:55,353
You stay inside and keep guard.

784
01:22:57,659 --> 01:22:59,734
(speaks Chinese)

785
01:23:19,138 --> 01:23:21,545
You missed! With a cannon!

786
01:23:30,566 --> 01:23:34,433
- Where did it go?
- Maybe the noise scared him away.

787
01:23:43,537 --> 01:23:46,537
Mr. Gummer, it's coming!
It's coming back!

788
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:49,617
Hiram, quick!

789
01:24:21,158 --> 01:24:24,194
- Yeah!
- (all cheer)

790
01:24:37,632 --> 01:24:39,671
It worked!

791
01:24:39,759 --> 01:24:40,838
Ugh!

792
01:24:40,927 --> 01:24:42,302
It stinks!

793
01:24:42,762 --> 01:24:44,469
(jangling)

794
01:24:45,306 --> 01:24:48,259
- There!
- Two more to go! Take your positions!

795
01:24:48,351 --> 01:24:50,260
Fu Yien, back inside!

796
01:25:07,745 --> 01:25:09,404
Juan!

797
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:20,797
Did it do that on purpose?

798
01:25:20,883 --> 01:25:22,626
(Christine) Juan, look out!

799
01:25:52,206 --> 01:25:54,412
Cannot shoot through dirt.

800
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,207
(creature roars)

801
01:26:15,645 --> 01:26:18,645
Hyah! Hah!

802
01:26:19,899 --> 01:26:23,481
Come on, you son of a bitch!

803
01:26:24,863 --> 01:26:26,820
(screech)

804
01:26:47,885 --> 01:26:49,960
¡Ay, caramba!

805
01:26:50,054 --> 01:26:52,675
Tecopa, gracias.

806
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:55,433
Aston...

807
01:26:55,518 --> 01:27:00,263
(whispers) Astonishingly clever,
my man.

808
01:27:00,356 --> 01:27:04,733
- It take your gun. Did it know?
- I fear they are very intelligent.

809
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:07,488
- But not as smart as us.
- No.

810
01:27:07,571 --> 01:27:10,821
Not as smart as us.
And there's only one left.

811
01:27:10,908 --> 01:27:14,988
Where the hell is it?
Let it show itself!

812
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,915
Tecopa...

813
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:32,085
(rumbling)

814
01:27:58,788 --> 01:28:01,113
(jangling)

815
01:28:11,426 --> 01:28:14,426
- Is it leaving?
- No.

816
01:28:14,512 --> 01:28:19,469
No, it's circling. Listening for prey.

817
01:28:24,147 --> 01:28:26,388
What do we do?

818
01:28:26,482 --> 01:28:29,399
It seems our rifles
aren't strong enough to kill it.

819
01:28:29,485 --> 01:28:32,604
- Without the punt gun, I fear we're lost.
- (speaks Chinese)

820
01:28:32,697 --> 01:28:36,908
So we just stop the fight, then? Give up?

821
01:28:36,993 --> 01:28:39,483
Maybe we take traction engine.
Try to get away.

822
01:28:39,578 --> 01:28:43,029
- It moves so slowly.
- And you would leave our town?

823
01:28:43,124 --> 01:28:46,955
- You have ideas for killing it?
- (speaks Chinese)

824
01:28:47,044 --> 01:28:50,128
A man must learn to sail in all winds.

825
01:28:50,673 --> 01:28:54,207
We must do what we can
with what we have.

826
01:28:54,301 --> 01:28:56,376
(jangling continues)

827
01:28:57,805 --> 01:29:00,640
Well said.

828
01:29:00,724 --> 01:29:05,848
You have black powder.
Maybe we could blow it up somehow.

829
01:29:05,938 --> 01:29:09,935
Sure. We make big firecracker.
I know how.

830
01:29:10,025 --> 01:29:14,852
Excellent - but quietly.
Move very, very slowly.

831
01:29:15,614 --> 01:29:18,982
Fu Yien, you go inside
and get twine for fuse.

832
01:29:19,076 --> 01:29:20,949
OK.

833
01:29:33,673 --> 01:29:38,963
- What are you doing?
- Powder for the fuse must be very fine.

834
01:29:46,686 --> 01:29:49,259
Almost there. Just another few minutes.

835
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:55,936
Fu...

836
01:30:11,335 --> 01:30:12,745
Fu!

837
01:30:16,841 --> 01:30:20,256
- I can't see the door.
- Fu, stay very quiet.

838
01:30:25,808 --> 01:30:27,966
Make noise!

839
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:31,345
Out here! Hey!

840
01:30:34,441 --> 01:30:36,314
(shrieking)

841
01:30:43,408 --> 01:30:46,611
Why doesn't it come for us?
For the noise?

842
01:30:46,703 --> 01:30:49,822
I don't know.
They keep learning our every trick.

843
01:30:49,915 --> 01:30:52,488
He's over here.

844
01:30:54,753 --> 01:30:55,997
Fu!

845
01:30:56,088 --> 01:30:57,546
Good boy. Good boy.

846
01:30:57,631 --> 01:30:59,706
(roaring)

847
01:31:03,887 --> 01:31:06,508
Hurry up. The wagon! In the wagon!

848
01:31:06,598 --> 01:31:09,005
Get on.

849
01:31:13,313 --> 01:31:15,803
- Oh, good Lord!
- Let's get the rifles.

850
01:31:18,568 --> 01:31:20,643
The bomb!

851
01:31:35,543 --> 01:31:38,662
- Pyong, you must finish the bomb.
- I need more time!

852
01:31:45,219 --> 01:31:47,674
We'll never have time to finish that!

853
01:31:49,223 --> 01:31:51,464
I have an idea.

854
01:32:05,155 --> 01:32:07,147
¡Hijo de puta!

855
01:32:10,995 --> 01:32:13,568
Pyong, that big belt.

856
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:19,740
Excellent, excellent.
Tecopa! Help us here!

857
01:32:21,588 --> 01:32:25,419
- What we need is some kind of hook.
- I know where.

858
01:32:25,509 --> 01:32:27,300
Over here, Juan!

859
01:32:51,743 --> 01:32:53,320
Go.

860
01:33:03,421 --> 01:33:04,583
Go!

861
01:33:21,606 --> 01:33:24,559
(roars)

862
01:33:25,985 --> 01:33:27,479
(Gummer) Watch out!

863
01:33:33,409 --> 01:33:34,903
Yes!

864
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:05,729
- Mrs. Lord, are you well?
- Yes. Are you all right?

865
01:34:05,816 --> 01:34:07,393
Yes, I am.

866
01:34:18,161 --> 01:34:21,078
Gracias, amiguito.

867
01:34:22,874 --> 01:34:25,874
- You got 'em, Mr. Gummer.
- Yes, Hiram. You got 'em.

868
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:28,167
No, no.

869
01:34:28,254 --> 01:34:29,712
We got 'em.

870
01:34:31,508 --> 01:34:33,666
Well done, well done.

871
01:34:34,886 --> 01:34:36,878
(whistle blows)

872
01:34:48,566 --> 01:34:49,846
Hiram!

873
01:34:49,942 --> 01:34:55,102
The bank has approved your loan. You
can hire new workers, reopen the mine.

874
01:34:55,198 --> 01:34:59,029
Well, if I recall,
it no longer belongs to me.

875
01:35:01,454 --> 01:35:04,620
It's yours, Hiram. It's your mine.

876
01:35:04,707 --> 01:35:06,995
We couldn't cheat you that way.

877
01:35:07,084 --> 01:35:09,621
You need it worse than we do.

878
01:35:09,712 --> 01:35:13,412
That's very kind. But I'll only
assume ownership under two conditions.

879
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:14,882
(speaks Chinese)

880
01:35:14,967 --> 01:35:16,758
"Conditions"?

881
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:21,719
We agree never to tell anyone
about the dirt dragons.

882
01:35:21,807 --> 01:35:25,721
If word of them ever got out,
no one would ever settle here.

883
01:35:25,811 --> 01:35:28,847
And the second condition?

884
01:35:28,939 --> 01:35:31,394
That the first proceeds of the mine
are used

885
01:35:31,483 --> 01:35:36,228
to build a hotel
and a market with real walls,

886
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:39,321
to pay off Juan's land, and, uh...

887
01:35:40,033 --> 01:35:42,606
Tecopa, what do you want?

888
01:35:46,456 --> 01:35:48,448
A new statue.

889
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:50,664
One that looks like me.

890
01:35:50,752 --> 01:35:54,085
And to commission a statue for Tecopa.

891
01:35:54,172 --> 01:35:56,627
Does everyone agree to this?

892
01:36:30,541 --> 01:36:32,829
I am fearfully outclassed.

893
01:36:32,919 --> 01:36:35,207
It's good you've decided to stay.

894
01:36:35,296 --> 01:36:39,673
I shall personally supervise the mine - I
mean, as soon as I learn how it all works.

895
01:36:39,759 --> 01:36:42,925
And I've selected
an excellent location for my home.

896
01:36:43,012 --> 01:36:47,389
On high ground. Readily defended.
It will even have a basement.

897
01:36:47,475 --> 01:36:49,550
That's a lot of room for one person.

898
01:36:49,643 --> 01:36:53,771
Ideally, it... won't be for just one.

899
01:37:00,613 --> 01:37:05,987
- Oh, I really am hopeless.
- You'll get better with a little practice.

900
01:37:06,076 --> 01:37:11,615
In the meantime I bought something that
might aid in your success as a marksman.

901
01:37:15,711 --> 01:37:17,786
Dandy.

902
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,375
Hiram?

903
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:40,357
(he laughs and cheers)

904
01:37:47,992 --> 01:37:50,482
(he laughs maniacally)
