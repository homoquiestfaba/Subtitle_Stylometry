1
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:05,139
- [Charles] It is
 here I love you most.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,776
In moonlit fields
 of ripening marble.

3
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,214
Hushed solitude
 of polished wood.

4
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:15,816
Melting wax and
whispered Latin liturgy.

5
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:20,621
It is here I love you most.

6
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:24,192
As you bleed into reality.

7
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,161
Into deepening shadows.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,798
I need you, my Galatea.

9
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,268
Welcome to my dreams.

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,673
(deep breathing)

11
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:46,780
- [Deborah] Do you
 remember when we first met?

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,815
- Of course.

13
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,251
- What was I wearing?

14
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,223
- A long blue dress with
 a slit right up the side?

15
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,327
- [Deborah] Where were we?

16
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:03,331
- [Charles] It was ...
it was at a restaurant.

17
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:04,865
- You don't remember, do you?

18
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,970
(chuckles) It was Nick's.

19
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:13,141
Remember that little
 Italian restaurant?

20
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:14,542
- [Charles] Yeah.

21
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,978
- [Deborah] Why do we
 remember things like that?

22
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,383
- [Charles] Well, I
 remember the dress

23
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:24,084
because you were so beautiful.

24
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,188
- Hmm.

25
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,822
Well I remembered
 the restaurant,

26
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,592
but I didn't remember the dress.

27
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:40,868
(Deborah chuckling)

28
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,436
Did you wanna have kids?

29
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,273
- Of course.

30
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,674
I love Becky to death.

31
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,644
- [Deborah] Do you
 wanna have another?

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,947
- [Charles] Maybe.

33
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,489
- [Deborah] Tell me
 again why you love me.

34
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,960
- Because you're beautiful,
 intelligent and perceptive.

35
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:11,465
- [Deborah] What, that's it?

36
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,302
- [Charles] What, you
 want the whole list?

37
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,703
- [Deborah] Yes.

38
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:19,207
- Okay, you're ... mature,

39
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:20,708
independent, warm.

40
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,777
And you look great
 in a blue dress

41
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,679
with a long slit up the side.

42
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,547
- [Deborah] Yeah?

43
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:30,351
Hm.

44
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,021
Do you remember our first?

45
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:36,690
- Our first time?

46
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,525
- Yeah.

47
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:39,660
- It was incredible.

48
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:41,562
- It was magic.

49
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,734
I knew from that moment on

50
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,636
I had to be with you forever.

51
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,708
- [Charles] I just
 wanted to please you.

52
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,377
- You did.

53
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,211
Oh, you did.

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,483
When you sliced her throat

55
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:07,087
and that blood drained
 out all over my hands,

56
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,122
oh, honey, it was orgasmic.

57
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,593
Mm.

58
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:16,697
- [Charles] Deborah?

59
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,565
- [Deborah] Yeah.

60
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:19,600
- [Charles] I love you.

61
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,374
- [Deborah] I love you too.

62
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,944
(upbeat jazz music)

63
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,060
(meat sizzling)

64
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,063
(upbeat jazz music)

65
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,742
- [Deborah] Something
 sure smells good.

66
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,044
And I am starving.

67
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,751
- I was wondering if you ever
 were gonna come home at all.

68
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:15,222
- Well, I'm sorry, but the
 stupid bitch in line in front

69
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:18,191
of me at the grocery store
decided that she wanted to argue

70
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,528
about a mistake
 on a 10-cent item.

71
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:21,829
So it took forever.

72
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,132
- Why didn't you change lines?

73
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,000
- Because they only
 had one line open.

74
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:31,472
(upbeat jazz music)

75
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,444
Oh, hey, listen, they
didn't have the Chianti,

76
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,211
so I got you this Cabernet.

77
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,880
Okay?

78
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,515
- You didn't vacuum
 like I asked.

79
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:43,717
- Sorry.

80
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,920
I got sidetracked.

81
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,556
- By what?

82
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:49,823
- Television.

83
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,292
* Fare thee well
and go to hell *

84
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,963
* Fare thee well
and go to hell *

85
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,832
So, when's dinner
 gonna be ready?

86
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,103
- Well the noodles'll
 take about 10 minutes.

87
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,574
And I'm gonna throw them in as
 soon as the Simmons get here.

88
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:07,408
- The Simmons?

89
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,712
- Professor Simmon and his wife?

90
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,046
We met them last week.

91
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:15,749
- Okay.

92
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,252
- And we invited them
over to dinner tonight.

93
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:22,990
- Oh, shit.

94
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,395
- I completely forgot.

95
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:28,596
- Why do you think I had you go

96
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:29,830
to the grocery store
and get all that stuff?

97
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,998
- Because I thought
 you were gonna be

98
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,367
making me a romantic dinner.

99
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,935
- Well, sorry, not tonight.

100
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,505
We talked about this.

101
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,473
- Well, can we cancel?

102
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,876
I'm not in the mood for company.

103
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,613
- They've already called and
 said they're on their way.

104
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,449
* You're strutting
 through that door *

105
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,817
* I feel my passing
 starting to rise *

106
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,119
Look, I'll make it
 up to you, all right?

107
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,286
- Fine.

108
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,254
- I promise.

109
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,088
- Fine.

110
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:56,957
- Fine.

111
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,828
Now go and change.

112
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:01,629
- Change?

113
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,632
- Change into something nice.

114
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,366
We're having guests
 over tonight.

115
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,236
- Fine, God.

116
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,239
(upbeat jazz music)

117
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,184
* I never felt I
 second-rated you *

118
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:28,756
* I did everything
 you ever told me to *

119
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,358
- Shit.

120
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,361
(upbeat jazz music)

121
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:51,344
Oh, and don't forget that the
 knives face toward the plate.

122
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,882
* So go get the shovel, dear

123
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:58,185
* I'll go pick out a plot

124
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:01,789
* To lay this bag of
bones weary and pained *

125
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:02,790
* To rest in a shady

126
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,224
Are you done yet?

127
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,561
- Would you like to
come in here and check?

128
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,999
- Would you chill?

129
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,001
You're the one who
 forgot about tonight.

130
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,871
What are you PMSing
 or something?

131
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,609
Oh yeah, that's right.

132
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,577
You're not having
 your period, are you?

133
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,481
When were you gonna tell
me about that, Deborah?

134
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,016
- Tell you what?

135
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,118
- You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

136
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,122
- Don't worry, I'm not pregnant.

137
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,757
- Well then what's
 with the test?

138
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,894
(doorbell ringing)

139
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,564
- Company's here.

140
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,503
- Charles, this is delicious.

141
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,337
- Thank you.

142
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,404
- It's okay.

143
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,239
- What's in it?

144
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:56,143
- Well, I could tell you, but
 then I'd have to kill you.

145
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,212
It's a secret recipe.

146
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,981
- Well, it's delicious.

147
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,416
- Wine, Deborah?

148
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,618
- Deborah doesn't drink.

149
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,154
- I'm in recovery.

150
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,623
- Oh really?

151
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,860
So is my brother. He's been
 sober ... five years now.

152
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,596
- Deborah just celebrated
 one year of sobriety.

153
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,567
- I had a car accident a
little over a year ago.

154
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:20,968
We almost lost out daughter.

155
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,337
Really woke me up to
what it was I was doing.

156
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,374
- Oh.

157
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,508
- Daughter?

158
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,476
- [Deborah] Becky.

159
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,545
- She's already in bed.

160
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,446
Came down with a
 little bug yesterday.

161
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,617
- Hm, I'm sorry to hear that.

162
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:40,120
So I guess that
 means we won't be.

163
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,623
- [Deborah] Won't be what?

164
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,092
- We'll be sure to be
 quiet and not wake her up.

165
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,294
- Oh, no, it's okay. We've
 got her in our bedroom.

166
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,796
It's a lot quieter back there.

167
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,299
(jazz music)

168
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,903
- So, Lynden, tell me, what
 does a sociology professor

169
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,404
do exactly when
 he's not teaching?

170
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,206
- Oh, this is great.

171
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,541
- Well, actually, right
now, I'm researching

172
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,277
serial killers and their
effect on the community.

173
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,278
- Huh.
 - Really?

174
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,980
- What kinda research?

175
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,549
- [Stacy] Tell them about
 the one in Pittsburgh.

176
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,885
- Well we set up this experiment
where we rented a house

177
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,354
in this middle-class
 suburban neighborhood.

178
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,656
We made sure there was
 a lotta foot traffic,

179
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,958
a lotta people jogging,
walking their dogs,

180
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,192
that sort of thing.

181
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:19,727
- [Charles] Like
 this neighborhood.

182
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:21,228
- Right.

183
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,463
So, then we had a guy move
 in there, and the rules were

184
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,732
that everything he did had to be

185
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:25,966
in plain sight of a neighbor.

186
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,234
Someone had to be on the street

187
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,736
while he was doing everything.

188
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,838
So we started things off by
 having him just bring home

189
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:34,507
chainsaws and axes and garbage
 bags and things like that.

190
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,976
Then, in the middle of
the night, we'd have him

191
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,745
fire up the chainsaw or
 just start chopping on stuff

192
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:40,347
so there's always strange
 noises coming outta the house.

193
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,882
Nobody calls the police.

194
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,350
- That's not so unusual.

195
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,285
- Right, well, we didn't
 expect anything right away,

196
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,655
but then we start
 elevating things.

197
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:49,857
Start having women
 drive to the house.

198
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,692
Then, in the middle of the
 night, the chainsaws go off

199
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:54,194
and the next morning,
he drives their car away

200
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,996
and walks back to the house.

201
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,198
Again, not a single response.

202
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,433
- Now all of this is
 in front of people?

203
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,369
- Exactly, somebody's
 watching everything.

204
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,371
So, by the end of the
 experiment, we've got this guy

205
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,707
on his front lawn with
 lights set up in the middle

206
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,309
of the night, digging
 holes in his yard

207
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,779
and then dragging garbage
 bags that are oozing

208
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,148
red liquid and burying them
 in the middle of his yard.

209
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,250
Not a single person
 calls the cops.

210
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,518
- [Charles] Nobody,
 not one person?

211
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,020
- I'm telling you,
 not until the end,

212
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,521
when we had the woman go up
 and start banging on the door

213
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,490
and screaming at him
like he cheated on her.

214
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,325
We got two calls for a
 domestic disturbance.

215
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,526
- You're kidding.

216
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,828
- Swear to God.

217
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,362
- Isn't it wild?

218
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,632
Just goes to show you how
 self-absorbed people are.

219
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,335
They don't even know what's
 going on around them.

220
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,438
(laughing)

221
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,175
- That reminds me of
 the time that Deborah

222
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,111
tried to set up a
neighborhood watch here.

223
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,880
- Oh, Charles, Charles, they
 don't wanna hear that story.

224
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,981
You don't wanna hear that.

225
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:48,949
- [Stacy] What? What happened?

226
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,918
- No, really, really, you don't.

227
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,419
- Okay, what happened
 was, they wanted to set up

228
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,721
a neighborhood watch, but
 while they were having

229
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:56,589
the meeting, the house
 next door got robbed.

230
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,758
- You're kidding.

231
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,293
- It wasn't my
 fault, Charles, stop.

232
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:03,363
- But that's funny, the
 house next door gets robbed

233
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,564
while you're having the
 neighborhood watch meeting.

234
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,767
- No, it is not funny.
 Are you done now?

235
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,869
- It's funny. It's okay.

236
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,872
(upbeat jazz music)

237
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,045
- Why don't I check on dessert?

238
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,982
(upbeat jazz music)

239
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,789
Look, I'm sorry, I shouldn't
 have made fun of you.

240
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,257
- You're right.
 You shouldn't have.

241
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,092
- If you would just lighten up.

242
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,127
- Don't you tell
 me to lighten up.

243
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,796
- This dinner is very
 important for me,

244
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:36,930
and you're ruining it.

245
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,431
First you make fun of the food.

246
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,333
Then you sulk. What's next?

247
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,802
- I can think of a few things.

248
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,037
- All right, wait,
 stop, all right?

249
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,473
I fucked up. I admit it.

250
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,741
- Yeah, you did.

251
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,242
- I shouldn't have
 made fun of you.

252
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,510
I'm a bad monkey.

253
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,247
(scoffing)

254
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,551
Now can we get through
 this peacefully?

255
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,556
- I'm still pissed, though.

256
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,060
- Fair enough ... but can we?

257
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,162
- Sure.

258
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,966
Just give me a couple
minutes to simmer down,

259
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,101
and I'll be okay.

260
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,535
- All right.

261
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:16,970
Maybe you can check on Becky.

262
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,645
- You're still in the doghouse.

263
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:34,021
(soft upbeat music)

264
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,801
* Your love is killing me

265
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,039
(sighing)

266
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:57,010
* My heart stops in your arms

267
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,350
* Once lost, for me to come in

268
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,755
(humming)

269
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:20,100
* I love you to death

270
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,105
* I love you to death

271
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,574
* I love you to death

272
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:28,408
- Mom?

273
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:35,883
- Hey you.

274
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,153
What are you doing up?

275
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,188
- You woke me up.

276
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:43,456
- I'm sorry.

277
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:47,127
(soft upbeat music)

278
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,528
Your fever's going down.

279
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,729
Are you feeling better?

280
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:51,965
- My stomach hurts.

281
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,667
- Well let's lay you back down.

282
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,303
- Okay.

283
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,604
Where's Daddy?

284
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,507
- He's in the dining
 room, with company.

285
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,741
- Can I come out?

286
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,743
- I don't think so, Sweetie.

287
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,046
I don't want you to give
the company your flu.

288
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:11,751
Do you want me to
 turn off the TV?

289
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:12,852
- No, leave it on.

290
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,121
- No, leave it on?

291
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,889
Okay, well, you just lay
here and get some sleep,

292
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:16,823
all right, baby?

293
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:17,657
- Okay.

294
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,260
Good night, Mom.

295
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,897
- Oh, good night,
 baby. I love you.

296
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,332
- I love you too.

297
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:33,173
* I love you to death

298
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:37,310
(soft upbeat music)

299
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:50,723
(sighing)

300
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,892
- I wasn't sure if you
 wanted the tiramisu.

301
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,463
You shoulda seen it.
 It was beautiful.

302
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,865
They keeled over right
 in the middle of dessert.

303
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,867
- What'd you use?

304
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,135
- Oh you know, the usual

305
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,304
Charlie special on
 top of the sweets.

306
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:05,138
- Mm-hm.

307
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,308
Nice, they're dead.

308
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:11,144
- Technically, no.

309
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,346
But they should be in
 another minute or two.

310
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,018
(sighing)

311
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:18,851
What's wrong?

312
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,088
- What's wrong?

313
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,657
God dammit, Charles.

314
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,427
Oh I don't know, we were
 supposed to do this together?

315
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,562
- You didn't even remember they
were coming over for dinner.

316
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,999
- Then once you reminded
me, I remembered.

317
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,000
- I thought you wouldn't mind.

318
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,202
- You thought I wouldn't mind?

319
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,004
Hell yes, I mind.

320
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,306
I was looking forward to
 bashing her fucking head in

321
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,573
with a baseball bat.

322
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,309
- All right, you're
 being melodramatic.

323
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,610
- Melodramatic?
 - Yes, melodramatic.

324
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,544
- You wanna see melodramatic?

325
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,013
- It runs in your family.

326
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:47,180
You, your mother, your
 sister, your whole family.

327
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,381
- Don't you dare compare
me to any of them.

328
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,716
Don't you dare bring them up!

329
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,952
- All right, calm
down, okay, just relax.

330
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,786
I'm sorry.

331
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,291
- Christ, Charles.

332
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,628
You know, you promised.
It was my turn.

333
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,563
- You didn't even
 remember they were coming.

334
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,798
- What does that have
 to do with anything?

335
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,300
You did the last one.

336
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,536
We agreed it was my turn.

337
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,272
- Okay, I misunderstood.

338
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,007
When you started talking
about not wanting them

339
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,509
to come over at all, I just
 assumed that you didn't care.

340
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,045
- Well you shouldn't
 have assumed.

341
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,479
I guess you shoulda asked.

342
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,548
I mean, poison?

343
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,084
- You know I like poison.

344
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:27,354
- Yeah, I know ...
 completely unoriginal.

345
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:30,823
- Oh, and bashing their
 brains in is so fresh and new.

346
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,193
- Well, you didn't seem
to mind when I bashed

347
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,728
that one's head in in
 Jersey now, did you?

348
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,963
- Of course not.

349
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,831
You hit her so hard you
knocked her head off.

350
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,666
- Oh.

351
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,039
I am getting so tired of this.

352
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,477
(sighing)

353
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,578
- Tired of what?

354
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,815
- You, acting like your
way is the right way.

355
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,518
- What are you talking about?

356
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,188
- What am I talking about?
You're so goddam condescending.

357
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,590
Just because I like to do
things a little bit differently

358
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,458
doesn't make you better than me.

359
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,926
- I never said that, all right.

360
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:09,829
- No, you didn't have to, did
 you? You just act like it.

361
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,564
So tired of it.

362
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,032
- Fine.

363
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,136
Charlie fucked up. Is
 that what you wanna hear?

364
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,404
- That's a start.

365
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:18,538
- Okay, well you heard it.

366
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,372
- Mm.

367
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,579
(chewing)

368
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:32,185
- Do you have to chew
 with your mouth open?

369
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:36,556
- What?

370
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,927
- Your mouth? Do you
 have to eat with it open?

371
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,229
Can you eat with it closed,

372
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,531
or is that too difficult a task?

373
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,971
(throat clearing)

374
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,476
(sighing)

375
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,111
- Are you gonna
 eat your dessert?

376
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,294
Okay, I guess it's
 time to clean up then.

377
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,566
You go get the saws. I'll
 lay out the plastic, okay?

378
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:20,400
- Kay.

379
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,844
(soft dramatic music)

380
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,586
(whimpering)

381
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,696
- Hello, my little pet.

382
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:55,302
How's my girl?

383
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,340
Your face is looking
good, holding up nicely.

384
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,910
Are you thirsty?

385
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,744
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:05,945
- Yeah.

387
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,547
Ah, dut dut dut.

388
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:08,815
I didn't say release.

389
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,086
And, release.

390
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,223
Good girl.

391
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,991
(hard breathing)

392
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,611
(chuckling)

393
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,879
That's enough.

394
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,649
(hard breathing)

395
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:53,693
All right.

396
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:56,329
Now.

397
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,033
If I leave that gag
 out of your mouth,

398
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,069
are you gonna keep quiet?

399
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:03,903
- Uh-huh.

400
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:05,572
- Promise?

401
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:06,839
- Promise.

402
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,840
- You remember what
 happened last time.

403
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,008
- Mm-hm.

404
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:09,842
- Yeah?

405
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,712
That's a good girl.

406
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,384
(hard breathing)

407
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:21,521
Where is she?

408
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:23,423
- No!

409
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,124
- Look at me. Where is she?

410
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,158
- He took her.

411
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,260
- Who took her?

412
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,062
- The man, he came, he took her.

413
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:30,997
- The man?

414
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,366
The man, that son of a bitch.

415
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,473
All right, where is she?

416
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,074
- Who?

417
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,143
- Don't play stupid with me.

418
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,778
- What are you talking about?

419
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,947
- The new girl, where is she?

420
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:50,450
- In the spaghetti.

421
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,592
- What the fuck is she
doing in the spaghetti?

422
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,728
- We talked about this.

423
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:05,598
- No, no, we did
 not talk about this.

424
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,368
- Are you calling me a liar now?

425
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:11,037
- I must be, because we
didn't talk about this.

426
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,405
- Yes, we did.

427
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,341
I said I wanted to use
 her for the spaghetti,

428
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:15,908
and you said fine.

429
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,243
- I said fine?

430
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:18,511
No, I did not say fine.

431
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,480
I wouldn't have said
 fine, because I didn't

432
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,249
think it was fine,
 I had plans for her.

433
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:26,686
Where's the rest of her?

434
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:29,822
- [Charles] Freezer.

435
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,960
(soft dramatic music)

436
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,535
- This is not what
 I had planned.

437
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:46,706
- What did you have planned?

438
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,241
- To make her scream.
 To make her beg.

439
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,579
I don't know, how about
lick my fucking feet?

440
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,781
- So this is about sex again?

441
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,916
- Don't take that tone with me.

442
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,318
You have your ways,
 and I have mine.

443
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,154
- We can't always get
 our way, can we, Deborah?

444
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,656
- No, that must be true,

445
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,292
because that's twice now
 that you've taken my turn.

446
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,960
First, you took
 them away from me.

447
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,596
Then you take her away from me.

448
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:12,599
You're so goddam selfish.

449
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,367
- Would you just keep your
 voice down? Becky's sleeping.

450
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,268
- No, I will not
 keep my voice down.

451
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,571
And don't you try
 changing the subject.

452
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,008
What?

453
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:22,942
- What's this about?

454
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,615
- About you taking
 my fucking turn,

455
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:30,817
about you taking
 them away from me.

456
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,352
- What's this really about?

457
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,187
- [Deborah] I don't have
a clue what the fuck

458
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,823
you're talking about.

459
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:39,158
- It's not about them
 or the girl, is it?

460
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,697
Is this the baby thing again?

461
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,332
- Don't you throw that at me.

462
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,601
Don't you dare.

463
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,936
- It is. It is.

464
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,038
- No, it is not, it
 is not about a baby.

465
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,940
- Yes, it is, you're
upset because you wanna

466
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,608
have another baby and I don't,

467
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:56,876
and so now you're
 taking it out on me.

468
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,678
- No, no, you were
 the one who promised

469
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:00,480
that we could have another kid.

470
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,881
You promised.

471
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,750
- Why the fuck would I
wanna have another kid?

472
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,985
You can't even take care
of the one we have now.

473
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,421
You're always flying off
 the fucking handle, and, oh,

474
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:10,823
let's not forget about
 the car accident.

475
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,325
- You stop, and you stop
right fucking there.

476
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,961
That is not fair.

477
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,496
That is not fair.

478
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,798
Yes, I fucked up
 but I am sober now.

479
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,767
So you stop bringing that up.

480
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:21,601
- But Becky's--

481
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,035
- Let it go, Charles.

482
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,504
Becky nothing.

483
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:28,908
Yes, Becky, I fucked up, okay?

484
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,879
I fucked up, but
 it's done, it's over.

485
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,080
Let it go.

486
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,014
- Okay, you know what?

487
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,115
- What?

488
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,050
- You know what? Fuck this.

489
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,152
- Oh, fuck you.

490
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,321
- No, no, fuck you, Deborah.

491
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,190
I am sick and tired
 of your anger.

492
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,859
I'm fed up with your
self-righteous bullshit.

493
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,194
(laughing)

494
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:49,729
You cannot control your temper,

495
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:51,598
and you hurt
 everyone around you.

496
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,100
- You are such an asshole.

497
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,067
What are you doing?

498
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,670
What are you doing?

499
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,505
- I'm going outside.

500
00:23:58,505 --> 00:23:59,472
- Oh no, you are not.

501
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:00,740
You are not going outside.

502
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,841
You're gonna stand
 right fucking here

503
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,442
until we get this settled.

504
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,977
- Look, standing
here and arguing

505
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,513
is not gonna settle
 anything, all right?

506
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:07,914
I'm gonna go outside
 and cool down

507
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:10,182
before I say something
 really stupid.

508
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,118
- Do not walk away from me.

509
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,986
Don't you fucking
 walk away from me!

510
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:19,492
Get the fuck back in
 here and settle this now!

511
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:22,695
(door closing)

512
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,964
(sighing)

513
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,834
Well thank you very
 fucking much, both of you.

514
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,035
Really appreciate it.

515
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:30,870
You ruined my whole
 fucking evening!

516
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,240
(sighing)

517
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,442
(soft dramatic music)

518
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:39,178
(kicks striking)

519
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,182
(hard breathing)

520
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:51,290
(groaning)

521
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,227
(hard breathing)

522
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:07,907
These are so fucking important
 to you (breaks record).

523
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,578
How do you feel about that?

524
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,079
Don't care about me.

525
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:16,082
Don't care about what
I think or what I feel.

526
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,484
Well fine.

527
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,588
You wanna break a piece of me,

528
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:23,289
I'm gonna break a piece of you.

529
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,191
(record breaking)

530
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,193
You sorry, motherfucker.

531
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,198
(sobbing)

532
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,032
Ugh.

533
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:36,636
Ugh.

534
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:39,538
(soft piano music)

535
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:44,076
- Do you remember the
 first time we heard this?

536
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,411
- It was at Nick's.

537
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,245
- Mm-hmm.

538
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,019
* There is that wicked
 glint in your eye *

539
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:58,958
We danced in the middle
of the restaurant.

540
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,930
- Seems like such
 a long time ago.

541
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:08,367
* Heading for simpatico
lets me know *

542
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,341
- I knew I loved you from
 the moment I saw you.

543
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:23,582
* How dark in your heart

544
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,219
- And you're as beautiful
 now as you were then.

545
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,857
(soft piano music)

546
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:33,960
* Battered, bruised

547
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,794
- Okay.

548
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,999
(exhaling)

549
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:40,833
Okay.

550
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:49,241
(hard breathing)

551
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,822
- What are you doing?

552
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:03,823
- Come here.

553
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,693
Do you remember this one?

554
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:08,795
- Yeah ... how could I forget?

555
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,397
I almost broke my leg
 tripping in her guts (laughs).

556
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,334
What?

557
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:20,039
All right, what's the point?

558
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,341
- The point is, your temper.

559
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:24,744
This is what happens when
 you lose your temper.

560
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:26,012
We didn't even plan this one.

561
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,980
You just flew off the
 handle and killed her.

562
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,683
You made a mess. I
 had to clean it up.

563
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,852
We almost got caught.
 Do you remember that?

564
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:33,686
- Yeah.

565
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,590
- This is why I don't wanna
 have another baby, all right?

566
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,693
I'm afraid of what
your temper's gonna do.

567
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:49,268
Deborah, I can't
 take this, all right?

568
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,102
- What?

569
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,905
- I'm tired, I'm
 tired of the fighting.

570
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,506
I'm tired of the anger.

571
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,276
I can't handle this anymore.

572
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,377
- What are you saying?

573
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,249
What are you saying?

574
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,517
- I'm thinking about leaving.

575
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,019
- Oh, no.

576
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:09,789
No, you can't.

577
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,623
- [Charles] I can't
 take this, all right?

578
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,459
- You can't leave.
 I won't let you.

579
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:16,395
- [Charles] What's
 that supposed to mean?

580
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,366
- Do you still love me?

581
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,435
- [Charles] Yes, yes,
 I still love you,

582
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,671
but I can't handle
 this, all right?

583
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:28,107
- We love each other.
 We can work this out.

584
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:31,077
- [Charles] Look,
 no, it's not working.

585
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:32,544
It's not gonna work, all right.

586
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,214
We keep fighting and fighting
 and fighting and fighting.

587
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,784
- Then, then counseling.

588
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,285
- Counseling?

589
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:42,288
- Yeah ... I'm not gonna lose
 this relationship, Charles.

590
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:43,622
I'm not gonna lose you.

591
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:44,456
- Deborah.

592
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,626
- Look, we're talking
 right now, right?

593
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,429
We're not screaming at each
 other. We're not fighting.

594
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,132
We can work this out.

595
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:58,304
We can work this out.

596
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:01,340
Let's just go in
 the house and talk.

597
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,843
- [Charles] No, no, listen,
 I'm angry, you're angry.

598
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,344
We'll end up saying
 something stupid,

599
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:06,913
and it'll end up
 in another fight.

600
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:07,746
- Okay.

601
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:09,916
Okay.

602
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,052
Why don't you go
 for a drive then?

603
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,454
That always cools you off.

604
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:20,726
I'll go inside, and
 I'll clean up, okay?

605
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,261
It'll take an hour, maybe.

606
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,965
But then you have
 to come back home

607
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,266
so that we can talk.

608
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:33,439
- This isn't some kinda game?

609
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,808
- No, no, it's not.

610
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:38,377
Please.

611
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,282
- You're not gonna get angry
 for having to clean up?

612
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,118
- No.

613
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,821
As long as you promise me
 that you will come back

614
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:50,156
and we can talk.

615
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,793
- Okay.

616
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,196
(shovel striking)

617
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:58,330
Okay, I can do that.

618
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,735
(dog barking)

619
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,670
- I won't lose you.

620
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:08,841
I won't.

621
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,410
- I'll be back in a bit.

622
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:17,783
(sighing)

623
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:23,822
(shovel scraping)

624
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,994
(soft dramatic music)

625
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,905
- Now what am I gonna
do with the two of you?

626
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,808
(soft music)

627
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,078
(sighing)

628
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:49,215
(soft dramatic music)

629
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:03,295
(sighing)

630
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:13,272
- What are you thinking about?

631
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:14,873
- How perfect everything is.

632
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:17,843
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?

633
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,414
So did you enjoy your birthday?

634
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,117
- Yeah, it was fun.

635
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,921
I think the carnival
 wore Becky out.

636
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,724
- [Charles] I thought
 you two would enjoy that.

637
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,528
And your presents?

638
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:37,529
- [Deborah] They were good.

639
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:41,968
- What's wrong?

640
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,537
Come on, what's the matter?

641
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,774
- Do you love me?

642
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:51,310
- What?

643
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,279
- Do you still love me?

644
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,582
- Of course I do. What
 kind of a question is that?

645
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:57,449
- A selfish one.

646
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,786
- All right, what's going on?

647
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,693
- Everything that
 you got me was great.

648
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,228
The CDs were great.

649
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,431
All my presents were great.

650
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,265
But-

651
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,634
- But?

652
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:19,738
- Do you remember what I
wanted for my birthday?

653
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,040
What I asked you for?

654
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,779
One little piece of jewelry,

655
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,116
something that says
 that you love me.

656
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:30,916
That's all.

657
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,488
I'm being a selfish
 bitch, but you know what?

658
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:40,959
Seems to me that you
weren't even listening.

659
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,935
(sighing)

660
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:54,306
- You wouldn't mean something
 like this, would you?

661
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:58,610
- You tricked me.

662
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:01,247
- Yeah, I guess I did.

663
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:08,587
I am a selfish bitch.

664
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:11,157
- No, you're not. Now open it.

665
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:14,926
Go on.

666
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,332
- Ah.

667
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,403
Oh, Charles.

668
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,340
It's beautiful.

669
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,609
- And it's engraved.

670
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:39,218
- Always.

671
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:44,290
- And I will always love
you, no matter what.

672
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:49,428
Always.

673
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:00,572
- Always.

674
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,442
Always.

675
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:04,543
Fuck you.

676
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,546
Don't you ever lie to me again.

677
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,651
I'll make sure
 that never happens.

678
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,123
(upbeat dramatic music)

679
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,832
(paper tearing)

680
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:04,170
(upbeat dramatic music)

681
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,045
Son of a bitch.

682
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:17,383
(upbeat dramatic music)

683
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,367
- [Becky] Mom?

684
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,703
- Hi, baby.

685
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,606
What are you doing up?

686
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:42,208
- I heard you and Daddy.

687
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,318
Who are they?

688
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,521
- Oh, those are some
 friends of ours.

689
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:57,389
- Are they sleeping?

690
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:00,926
- Yes, they are.

691
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:03,762
So we're gonna try really hard
 not to wake them up, okay?

692
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:07,866
- Where's Daddy?

693
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,302
- He went to the store.

694
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:12,838
He'll be back in a little bit.

695
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,508
- Why are you two fighting?

696
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:19,811
- We're not fighting, baby.

697
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,848
We just had a
 little disagreement.

698
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,418
- I don't like it when you yell.

699
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:28,086
- I know you don't, baby.

700
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,087
I'm sorry.

701
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,758
Tell you what, why don't,

702
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:36,194
why don't I get you some
 of that dessert I promised?

703
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,229
Does that sound good?

704
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:40,165
- My stomach hurts.

705
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,400
- Your tummy hurts?

706
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:44,670
All right, baby.

707
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:49,174
How about Daddy and I
 come and read to you then?

708
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,743
When he gets back from the
 store, that sound good?

709
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:52,978
- Yeah.
- Okay.

710
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:55,080
- Will you wake me
 up if I'm sleeping.

711
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,116
- Yes, I will wake you
 up if you're sleeping.

712
00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:58,950
- Okay.

713
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:04,356
- Mm, let's get you
 back to bed, okay?

714
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:05,357
- All right.

715
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:07,259
- Come on.

716
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,295
Oh.

717
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:17,168
(soft music)

718
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,405
(door opening and closing)

719
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:20,238
- [Charles] Hey.

720
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,473
- Hey.

721
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:22,741
- [Charles] Sorry
 I took so long.

722
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,444
- That's okay, I just
 got finished cleaning.

723
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,079
- Looks nice.

724
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,914
- Thank you.

725
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,550
- Where'd you put them?

726
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,385
- I wrapped them up
 and put them away.

727
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:35,787
Figured we could do
 something with them tomorrow.

728
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,459
Poured you a glass of wine.

729
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:45,196
- [Charles] Thank you.

730
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,064
- You're welcome.

731
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,767
Becky wants us to
 read her a story.

732
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:51,537
- We can do that in a bit.

733
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,674
- So, how was your drive?

734
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:57,242
- It was fine.

735
00:37:57,242 --> 00:38:00,512
Just went off in the city
 and cooled down a little bit.

736
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:03,449
- [Deborah] Feel better?

737
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,684
- Much.

738
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:06,518
- Mm.

739
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:09,020
Sure do love you.

740
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,457
(soft music)

741
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:15,461
- I love you too.

742
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:23,001
As a matter of fact, I've got
 a little surprise for you.

743
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,570
- Oh, you do?

744
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,637
- Yeah, come on.

745
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:30,576
- No wait, sit, sit. Drink
your wine and let's talk, okay?

746
00:38:30,576 --> 00:38:31,743
- In a while, all right?

747
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,011
- I wanna sit and talk.

748
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,746
- In a while. Listen,
 I got a gift for you.

749
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,648
It's something to
 say I'm sorry, okay?

750
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,017
Give me this.

751
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:41,086
Now, sit down.

752
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,222
Come on, sit down.

753
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:45,424
- What is going on?

754
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:47,092
- It's a surprise.

755
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:49,495
(soft music)

756
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,766
Now, close your eyes.

757
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,436
- Charles, I am not
 closing my eyes.

758
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:59,705
- Deborah, close your eyes.

759
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,842
- You better not
 try anything funny.

760
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,311
- Trust me.

761
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:07,245
- Oh.

762
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:08,246
- You're gonna love this.

763
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,483
(sighing)

764
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:12,784
- So where did you get it?

765
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,087
- [Charles] It's just
 a little something

766
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,288
I picked up in the city.

767
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,029
(sighing)

768
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,464
Okay, you can open your eyes.

769
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,868
- Hi, I'm Mandy.

770
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,471
- I hired her just for you.

771
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:35,407
- We can't afford this.

772
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:37,175
- Don't worry about
 that right now, okay.

773
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,144
She's a present.

774
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:42,414
- And what did you
want me to do with her?

775
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,816
- Ha ha, leave that to me.

776
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:46,752
Your husband already
 told me what to do.

777
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,723
(upbeat music)

778
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,297
- Are you sure about this?

779
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,300
What about Becky?

780
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,370
- She's sleeping. Just watch.

781
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,973
(upbeat music)

782
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:49,400
(flesh squishing)

783
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,535
- Deborah!

784
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,337
- Stupid bitch.

785
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:53,238
- Deborah, stop it!

786
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:55,240
- Asshole.

787
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,342
- What the fuck are you doing?

788
00:42:57,342 --> 00:42:58,744
- What am I doing?

789
00:42:58,744 --> 00:42:59,878
You said she was for me.

790
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:01,412
- She was.

791
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,382
- She was not for me. You
 were all fucking over her.

792
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:06,685
- I thought we could ...
 I thought we could share.

793
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:07,686
- You thought we could share?

794
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:08,887
- Yeah.

795
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,121
- You fucking prick,
 we have a fight,

796
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:12,991
and you think that sex
is gonna make it better?

797
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:14,025
- Well.

798
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:14,960
- Fuck you.

799
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,227
- Put the fucking knife down.

800
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:19,130
- I will not. You
 wanted to fuck her.

801
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,065
- I never said that.

802
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:20,866
- You wanted to fuck her.

803
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:21,800
- I never said that.

804
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,268
- You didn't have to say it.

805
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,269
You know what, here, you
 want a little piece of her?

806
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,004
Take some baby, here.

807
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:28,640
- No?

808
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,108
Your actions speak louder
 than fucking words.

809
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,778
God, you are such a fucking
 prick, you know that?

810
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:33,879
- All right, what are
we gonna do about this?

811
00:43:33,879 --> 00:43:35,413
- Nothing, fuck you.

812
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,649
- Oh, geez, come here.

813
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,985
- Let go of me. I'm
gonna fucking hurt you!

814
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:41,853
(struggling)

815
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:45,290
- You ruined everything,
just like always.

816
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,726
(struggling)

817
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:51,596
- You bastard, let me go.

818
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,200
(hard breathing)

819
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:07,612
(soft dramatic music)

820
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:23,228
- Charles!

821
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:26,131
Charles!

822
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,199
Where are you?

823
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:30,702
Charles!

824
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:34,405
- Oh, you're awake.

825
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,107
- [Deborah] Yes, now let me go.

826
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,344
- Once again, I've had
 to clean up your mess.

827
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,113
- This isn't funny. Let me go.

828
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:45,416
- I can't do that, Deborah.

829
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,052
I'm getting tired
 of your temper.

830
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,191
- [Deborah] Okay, fine,
I get it. Now let me go.

831
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,761
- Nope.

832
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:56,928
I'm gonna have to
 teach you a lesson.

833
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:58,396
- [Deborah] What are you doing?

834
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,065
- You're gonna have to learn
 that you can't just fly

835
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:02,600
off the handle anytime
 you want to, Deborah.

836
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,002
- What is that? What is that?

837
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:05,236
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

838
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,738
- Don't struggle.
 - What's in it?

839
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:07,873
- It's just gonna make it
 hurt more. Do you want that?

840
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:09,274
- No, what is that? No.

841
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:11,442
(moaning)

842
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:14,212
What is that?

843
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,647
- Just amphetamines.

844
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,649
- My sobriety.

845
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,185
- What a joke.

846
00:45:20,185 --> 00:45:21,987
Come on, you and I know
 that you been sipping wine

847
00:45:21,987 --> 00:45:23,121
every chance you can get.

848
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:25,190
- No, I have not. I did not.

849
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,593
I've been been sober,
 I've been clean, I swear.

850
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:30,195
- I'm gonna teach
 you a lesson, okay?

851
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:31,396
- [Deborah] No,
 Charles, please don't.

852
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,498
- And this is gonna
 hurt like hell.

853
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:34,866
- [Deborah] Charles.

854
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:36,334
- But don't worry.

855
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:37,568
The amphetamines will
 keep you from passing out.

856
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,537
- Please don't, please
don't. What about Becky?

857
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:40,772
- Sh, sh.

858
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:41,572
- What about Becky?
 What about Becky?

859
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,140
She's gonna hear.

860
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:46,277
Ow! That's hot,
 please take it off.

861
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:47,712
Please take it off. Take it off.

862
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:49,981
No, oh!

863
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:52,550
Okay, okay.

864
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,452
Fuck.

865
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:55,520
Ow, it's hot.

866
00:45:56,955 --> 00:45:57,856
Get it off!

867
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:00,658
Ow!

868
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:03,261
Stop.

869
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:06,764
(soft dramatic music)

870
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,598
- Oh, God.

871
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,069
- It's okay. It's
 for your own good.

872
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:12,137
(moaning)

873
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:14,539
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.

874
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,342
- It's for your own good, okay.

875
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:19,344
Now listen, you're not in
 your right mind right now.

876
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:21,479
I'm gonna let you
 lay here for a bit,

877
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,849
and think about what you did.

878
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:27,052
(Deborah groaning)

879
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:28,186
- Fuck.

880
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:31,656
Wait, where are you going?

881
00:46:31,656 --> 00:46:32,958
Charles, come back here.

882
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:34,926
Fuck.

883
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:37,762
Think you're better than me.

884
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:39,965
Why do you think you're
better than me, huh?

885
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:45,336
(groaning)

886
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:48,039
How about that time in Dallas?

887
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:50,008
Remember that time
 when you decided

888
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:52,777
you were gonna dance
with that fucking slut?

889
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,612
You ended up
 embarrassing yourself

890
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:56,081
in front of your friends.

891
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:57,983
You made a big ole ass
 out of yourself, Charles.

892
00:46:57,983 --> 00:47:00,551
(upbeat music)

893
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:04,956
* I'm so tired of
 these ups and downs *

894
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:07,092
- Remember the time when

895
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:10,828
you just needed to
 introduce me to your parents

896
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:14,599
and you ended up getting drunk
 and hitting your brother?

897
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,667
Nice one, Charles,
 you remember that?

898
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:19,971
Everybody fucks up, Charles.

899
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:21,973
Even you.

900
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:24,075
Charles!

901
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,078
Charles.

902
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:30,081
(upbeat jazz music)

903
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:34,452
Charlie boy.

904
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:39,057
(deep breathing)

905
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:46,697
- Are you awake?

906
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:48,633
- Hm-mm.

907
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,306
- You wanna mess around?

908
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:56,141
- Not really.

909
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,210
- Why not?

910
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:01,947
Huh?

911
00:48:01,947 --> 00:48:03,915
- Do I always have
 to be in the mood?

912
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:09,487
- No, sorry. I was just asking.

913
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:15,860
- Actually, there
 was something that,

914
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,063
that I wanted to ask you.

915
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,165
- Okay.

916
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:22,800
- I don't know how to say it.

917
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:24,869
- Just say it.

918
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:32,944
- What would you ... say if I

919
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,815
wanted to bring another
woman into our bed?

920
00:48:41,186 --> 00:48:41,987
- Excuse me.

921
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,956
- [Deborah] You heard me.

922
00:48:44,956 --> 00:48:46,791
- You wanna bring
 another woman home?

923
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:49,294
- [Deborah] I'm curious.

924
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:53,064
- Curious as in wanting
 to sleep with her as well?

925
00:48:56,201 --> 00:48:58,569
Wow, what brought this up?

926
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:02,307
- I just, I been
 thinking about it.

927
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,044
I've always found women
 attractive, and I thought,

928
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:09,147
I don't know, I thought
it might be fun.

929
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,185
- Would this involve me as well?

930
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:15,120
- [Deborah] Yeah.

931
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,189
We could tag team her.

932
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:23,594
- Wow, okay, yeah. Sounds good.

933
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,030
- Under one condition.

934
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:26,931
- What?

935
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:27,865
- No fucking her.

936
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:31,836
That's off limits. That
part of you is for me.

937
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:35,273
- [Charles] Are you
 sure about this?

938
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:37,675
- Yeah, we can try it
 out, see if I like it.

939
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:43,748
There's ... one other thing.

940
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:46,784
- What's that?

941
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,955
- I'm just afraid you'll
end up wanting her

942
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:52,157
more than you want me.

943
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:54,792
- You don't have to
 worry about that.

944
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,361
That's not gonna happen.

945
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:57,495
- Well, you're gonna
 have to swear to it.

946
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,697
Otherwise, it's not happening.

947
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:00,631
- Oh, I swear.

948
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:04,302
I swear.

949
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:13,278
- Okay.

950
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:21,152
(upbeat jazz music)

951
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,359
- You fucked up, Charlie boy.

952
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:32,497
(groaning)

953
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,868
You tried to poison me.

954
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,407
You bitch, you
 tried to poison me.

955
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:45,743
Deborah, stop.

956
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:48,113
- [Deborah] Get away from me!

957
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:51,949
(groaning)

958
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,019
- [Charles] Deborah, let me in.

959
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:55,986
- Leave me alone, Charles.

960
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,922
- You tried to poison me!

961
00:50:57,922 --> 00:50:59,924
- [Deborah] And you
 tried to kill me!

962
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:02,393
- Look, I just hurt you. I
 wasn't trying to kill you.

963
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,728
(groaning)

964
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:06,131
- Just go away, Charles.

965
00:51:06,131 --> 00:51:08,699
Go away, and calm down.

966
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:11,569
(hard breathing)

967
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:12,637
- [Charles] Unlock this door.

968
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:13,471
- No!

969
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,142
(hard breathing)

970
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:19,644
- Fine.

971
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:25,850
(Charles breathing rapidly)

972
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,723
(soft guitar music)

973
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:37,262
(hard breathing)

974
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:46,404
- Mom, are you okay?

975
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:49,707
(groaning)

976
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:51,676
I'm scared.

977
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:52,510
- I know, honey.

978
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:56,581
- Is it me?

979
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,950
- What are you talking about?

980
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,287
- Are you and Daddy
fighting because of me?

981
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:03,754
(groaning)

982
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:07,124
- Of course not, honey.
 Daddy's just being a prick.

983
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:10,995
- You're not supposed
 to talk like that.

984
00:52:12,263 --> 00:52:13,598
- I know.

985
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:14,565
I know, honey.

986
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,673
You know, for someone
 who's supposed to be sick,

987
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:24,542
you sure are getting
 up an awful lot.

988
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,245
- I'm scared.

989
00:52:27,245 --> 00:52:28,946
- I know, baby. Lie down.

990
00:52:32,217 --> 00:52:34,285
- What are you fighting about?

991
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:38,756
- Oh, you know Daddy.
 He's just being difficult.

992
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,425
Thinks he always
has to be right.

993
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:44,262
- Always has to be right.

994
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:46,997
Can't ever admit
 that she's wrong.

995
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,137
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch,

996
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:55,673
bitch, bitch,
 always gotta bitch.

997
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,748
(device zapping)

998
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:05,182
- [Becky] Did Daddy hurt you?

999
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,718
- Yeah, baby, he did.

1000
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:08,553
He burned me.

1001
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:12,957
- [Becky] Does it hurt?

1002
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,361
- Yes, yes, it does.
 It hurts very bad.

1003
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:21,699
What's the matter, baby?

1004
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:26,103
Did Daddy hurt you?

1005
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:30,741
Baby, did Daddy do
 something to you?

1006
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:33,911
Becky?

1007
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,515
Did he do something to you?

1008
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:48,826
- He said he'd hurt me
real bad if I told you.

1009
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:51,962
- Baby, what did he do?

1010
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:57,868
- He said he'll hurt
 you too, if I tell.

1011
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:00,405
- Oh, honey.

1012
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:01,972
No, listen to me.

1013
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:06,277
I'm gonna be fine,
 and I'll protect you.

1014
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:11,081
Now you listen to me, it is
not okay for Daddy to hurt you.

1015
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,483
Now tell me what he did.

1016
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:16,821
- He touched me.

1017
00:54:18,723 --> 00:54:20,725
- [Deborah] Oh, where?

1018
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:21,559
- It hurt.

1019
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:23,594
- Oh, my baby.

1020
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:30,000
It's okay. You just
 go back to sleep.

1021
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,002
- [Becky] You won't
 tell, will you, Mama?

1022
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:35,039
- Oh, baby, I won't tell.

1023
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,842
Everything's gonna
 be just fine, okay?

1024
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:38,809
Just fine.

1025
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:43,381
(door opening)

1026
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:44,949
Charles, are you still here?

1027
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:50,054
Step away from the wall.

1028
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,624
- What, are you afraid of me?

1029
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,994
(soft dramatic music)

1030
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:58,262
- What are you doing?

1031
00:54:58,262 --> 00:54:59,530
- [Charles] Come and see.

1032
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:03,167
(dramatic music)

1033
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,144
- Put down the Taser, Charles.

1034
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,680
- Put down the bat.

1035
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,816
- No, you started this, and
 I'm gonna fucking finish it.

1036
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,317
I'm gonna split your
 fucking skull open.

1037
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,621
- Look, okay, I admit the
 iron was a bit extreme.

1038
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:25,490
All right, now put down the bat!

1039
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,958
- No, I will not.
 This is for Becky.

1040
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,061
- [Charles] Becky, what
are you talking about?

1041
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:31,896
- You know what
 I'm talking about.

1042
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:35,032
How could you? How could you?

1043
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:36,233
- [Charles] How could I what?

1044
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,503
- How could you
 touch her like that?

1045
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:39,437
- Touch her?

1046
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:41,138
- Yes, you sick, twisted fuck.

1047
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:42,373
- No, no, whoa, hold,

1048
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:43,974
Hold on a second,
 all right, wait.

1049
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:44,809
Look.

1050
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,713
All right, I'm
 putting this down.

1051
00:55:48,713 --> 00:55:51,882
(soft dramatic music)

1052
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:54,018
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about.

1053
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:56,554
I'm unarmed, all right.

1054
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:58,623
You know I wouldn't
 do anything like that.

1055
00:55:58,623 --> 00:56:00,891
- She just told me, Charles.

1056
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:01,826
- She what?

1057
00:56:01,826 --> 00:56:03,994
- She just fucking told me.

1058
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:05,496
Don't you play with me, Charles.

1059
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:09,166
- Deborah, Deborah, come on.
 This is ridiculous, all right.

1060
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:11,068
All right, I'll admit,
 I've done some sick

1061
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:13,471
and evil shit in
 my life, all right.

1062
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:15,473
But you know I would
 never touch Becky.

1063
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,109
- Why would she lie to me? Why?

1064
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,879
- I don't know. This
 is insane, okay!

1065
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,048
Look, you know me
 better than that.

1066
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,283
You know I wouldn't do it.

1067
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:27,284
You know it.

1068
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,756
All right, just calm
 down, all right.

1069
00:56:31,756 --> 00:56:32,723
It's gonna be okay.

1070
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:35,993
All right, I love you.

1071
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:39,263
- You love me?

1072
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:41,065
You love me?

1073
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:43,968
You tried to kill
 me twice tonight,

1074
00:56:43,968 --> 00:56:46,270
and you wanna bring up love.

1075
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,706
Here's your fucking love.

1076
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:49,840
Love.

1077
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,976
Love, love, love is shit!

1078
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:54,912
Shit, it's bullshit.

1079
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,113
Love is shit.

1080
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:59,216
There is no fucking such
thing as love, okay!

1081
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:02,887
(hard breathing)

1082
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:05,122
- I do love you.

1083
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:08,559
- You love me.

1084
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,761
No, no, you don't love me.

1085
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,998
As a matter of fact, I
 bet you fucked that whore

1086
00:57:13,998 --> 00:57:17,568
before you even brought her
home to me tonight, didn't you?

1087
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:20,337
- Whoa, whoa, no,
 you know that never--

1088
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:21,171
- You did!

1089
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,006
- No.

1090
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:22,840
- You fucking did.

1091
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,674
- That didn't happen.

1092
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:24,509
- Yeah, I can tell.

1093
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:25,910
- No, stop it!

1094
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:27,144
- What's the matter, Charles?

1095
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:29,446
- Don't you ever accuse
me of cheating on you.

1096
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,281
- Oh, am I pushing your buttons?

1097
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:36,253
- Never accuse me
 of cheating on you.

1098
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:39,624
- Fuck you.

1099
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:40,457
Fuck you!

1100
00:57:43,027 --> 00:57:45,162
- No, no, no, fuck you!

1101
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,333
- Don't you fucking
 walk away from me!

1102
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,835
You get your ass back here!

1103
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:55,105
Fuck you, don't you walk
 away from me, you bastard.

1104
00:57:55,105 --> 00:57:56,240
- This is bullshit.

1105
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,376
I can't believe you'd
even accuse me of that.

1106
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:11,889
(exhaling)

1107
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:14,992
I'm tired of fighting.

1108
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:19,463
We can't talk.

1109
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:21,732
Everything I say
is misconstrued.

1110
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:22,767
You don't listen.

1111
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:23,801
- Oh, I don't listen?

1112
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:27,337
I'm tired of trying to listen.

1113
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,742
We go round and round and round

1114
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:35,813
and round, and nothing
 ever fucking changes.

1115
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:38,883
- I can't take this anymore.

1116
00:58:42,086 --> 00:58:43,087
- I've tried, but.

1117
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:48,392
- So why have you stayed?

1118
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,229
(inhaling and exhaling)

1119
00:58:52,229 --> 00:58:53,263
- For Becky.

1120
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:55,866
- That's it?

1121
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:03,641
So I guess it's over then.

1122
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:08,646
- It's been over.

1123
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,616
- [Charles] You believe that?

1124
00:59:11,616 --> 00:59:12,850
- I know that.

1125
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:17,321
I should have agreed with
 you outside, earlier.

1126
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:20,591
- What are you talking about?

1127
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,526
- I've been thinking
 about leaving too.

1128
00:59:26,697 --> 00:59:28,365
- Why, because of the arguments?

1129
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:30,635
(scoffing)

1130
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:32,603
What?

1131
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:36,440
What is it? Talk to me.

1132
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:43,113
- I just don't,

1133
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,617
I don't feel it anymore.

1134
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:53,390
I don't feel the
 same way I used to.

1135
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:01,966
I don't love you
 anymore, Charles,

1136
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:06,303
and I haven't for
 ... a very long time.

1137
01:00:09,573 --> 01:00:13,543
I, I didn't, I didn't
 know how to say it.

1138
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,045
- Don't talk to me, all right?

1139
01:00:18,015 --> 01:00:19,283
- I'm gonna leave, okay?

1140
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:26,056
I'll find a place
 to stay on my own.

1141
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:27,792
And ... I'll leave.

1142
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:36,066
- You're leaving me?

1143
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:41,605
- What the hell else
 are we talking about?

1144
01:00:41,605 --> 01:00:43,640
- First you accuse
 me of cheating,

1145
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,942
then you call me a bastard,

1146
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:46,410
and now you tell me that
you've been lying to me

1147
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,078
all along, you didn't
 ever love me at all?

1148
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:49,680
- No, no.

1149
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,181
I did.

1150
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:54,084
But enough fighting will
 tear that right down, okay.

1151
01:00:55,686 --> 01:00:57,387
- I'm not gonna let you go.

1152
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:59,890
- You're not gonna let
 me go? Are you joking?

1153
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:03,093
You're the one who brought up
 leaving in the first place.

1154
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:05,262
- I know. I was
 speaking in anger.

1155
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:06,997
- Oh, you've gotta
 be kidding me.

1156
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:11,268
You and I both know it's
 been over for a long time.

1157
01:01:13,938 --> 01:01:16,306
- I'm not gonna let
 it end like this.

1158
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:19,810
- Just let it go,
 Charles. You know.

1159
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,981
- Don't do this to me.

1160
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:26,516
You don't love me?

1161
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,318
That's bullshit. I
 know it's bullshit.

1162
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:29,920
- Put the gun down, Charles.

1163
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:34,258
What, are you gonna shoot me?

1164
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:38,829
Good, go ahead.

1165
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,733
Come on. Do it, right here.

1166
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:44,601
Give it to me.

1167
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:49,907
Now you're chickenshit?

1168
01:01:49,907 --> 01:01:52,877
Here, right here.

1169
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:55,045
Pull the trigger, baby.

1170
01:01:56,613 --> 01:01:57,481
Yeah.

1171
01:01:57,481 --> 01:02:00,584
(soft dramatic music)

1172
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:06,456
- What are you smiling about?

1173
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,458
- I didn't say anything.

1174
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:11,361
(hard breathing)

1175
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:13,063
- You're smirking.

1176
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:13,898
- Am I?

1177
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,870
Just do it. Pull the
 trigger, get it over with.

1178
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:23,740
(hard breathing)

1179
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:28,212
- You bitch.

1180
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:30,781
You were gonna let me kill you.

1181
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:32,983
- That's what you wanted.

1182
01:02:32,983 --> 01:02:34,218
- You wouldn't even
 put up a fight,

1183
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:35,152
and you were gonna
 let me kill you.

1184
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:36,386
How could you do that to me?

1185
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:38,522
- You're being a bit
 melodramatic now.

1186
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:40,690
- You been putting up a
 fight all your goddam life,

1187
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,159
and you're gonna just stand
 there and let me shoot you?

1188
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:42,993
- Charles.

1189
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:45,029
- Don't Charles me!

1190
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:46,964
You love me. I know it.

1191
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:50,500
You were gonna let me kill you.

1192
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,836
- You're being ridiculous.

1193
01:02:53,003 --> 01:02:56,540
- Why can't you just
admit that you love me?

1194
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,342
- I'm not listening to
this, Charles. I'm not.

1195
01:02:58,342 --> 01:02:59,709
- Don't you walk away from me.

1196
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:01,511
- Don't you lay
 your hands on me.

1197
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:04,614
Don't you fucking touch me.

1198
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,917
You make me sick.

1199
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:09,153
- Just admit it.

1200
01:03:09,153 --> 01:03:11,321
(knocking on door)

1201
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:13,190
- Are you expecting someone?

1202
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:14,758
Maybe another one of
 your little whores.

1203
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:15,893
- Shut up.

1204
01:03:15,893 --> 01:03:18,495
- Why? So you can go fuck her?

1205
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:19,696
(knocking on door)

1206
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:21,899
- [Officer] Police.
 Please open up.

1207
01:03:21,899 --> 01:03:23,600
- Fuck, maybe you
 oughta invite them in,

1208
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,869
and we can tell them about all

1209
01:03:24,869 --> 01:03:26,370
the little whores
 you been fucking.

1210
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,604
- This is not a time
 to fuck around, okay.

1211
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:28,839
I got a dead body in here.

1212
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:30,540
- Better yet, I think
we should bring them in,

1213
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,143
introduce them to the
hostage, our little pet,

1214
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,879
and then show them all
 the little dead bodies

1215
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:36,413
we've got strewn
 all over the house.

1216
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:37,381
- Shut up.
 - What do you think?

1217
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:38,849
- Listen, listen, take it easy.

1218
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:40,317
We gotta take care
 of this, okay.

1219
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,386
It's not time for our
 fucking personal problems.

1220
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:43,653
We got fucking cops outside.

1221
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,222
- You're right. We do
need to take care of it.

1222
01:03:45,222 --> 01:03:46,256
I'm gonna open the door.

1223
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:48,926
- Listen, Deborah, no, Deborah.

1224
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:49,759
Listen.

1225
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,028
- Don't.

1226
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:53,163
- For Becky's sake, keep
your goddam mouth shut.

1227
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:53,998
- Fine, sh.

1228
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,440
- Sir.

1229
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,509
- Sorry, I was dozing.

1230
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,078
- We had a few calls
 from some neighbors

1231
01:04:08,078 --> 01:04:09,880
about some fighting.

1232
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,416
- Fighting? No,
 no fighting here.

1233
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:13,884
- [Officer] So there have
 been no problems here?

1234
01:04:13,884 --> 01:04:17,021
- No, I mean my wife and I
 had a little argument earlier,

1235
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:18,288
but we weren't fighting.

1236
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:20,657
- Is your wife home?

1237
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,193
- Yeah.

1238
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,028
- Can we see her?

1239
01:04:25,162 --> 01:04:25,996
- Sure.

1240
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:29,466
Deborah, could you come
to the door please?

1241
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:32,069
Hey, listen, there's not a
 law against arguing, is there?

1242
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:34,704
- We just have to check and
 make sure everyone is safe.

1243
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:35,772
- Okay, makes sense.

1244
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:37,207
- Is there a problem?

1245
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,475
- [Officer] We had
 a few phone calls

1246
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:40,810
from some neighbors
 about some fighting.

1247
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:41,745
- [Deborah] Really?

1248
01:04:43,914 --> 01:04:45,549
- You okay?

1249
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,751
- He has very bad back spasms.

1250
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:49,920
Stabbing pain runs
 up and down his body.

1251
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,223
It's, you know, are
 you okay, honey?

1252
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,092
- Yeah, I'm sure it'll pass.

1253
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,795
- Have you been fighting?

1254
01:04:58,795 --> 01:04:59,964
- Fighting?

1255
01:04:59,964 --> 01:05:03,400
No. Well, we had a
little argument earlier,

1256
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,769
but other than that,
 no, nothing serious.

1257
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:09,773
- And you're okay,
 nothing physical?

1258
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:13,177
- Physical, oh, no no,
 Charles would never hurt me.

1259
01:05:13,177 --> 01:05:14,211
Would you, honey?

1260
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:17,281
- Of course I wouldn't.

1261
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:22,019
- So, if there's nothing
else, my daughter's sick

1262
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:23,988
and I'd really like
 to get back to her.

1263
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:27,424
- You're both sure,
 everything's okay?

1264
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,993
- Absolutely.
 - Positive.

1265
01:05:30,995 --> 01:05:33,197
- All right, but keep
 the arguing down,

1266
01:05:33,197 --> 01:05:35,532
because I don't wanna be
 back out here again tonight.

1267
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:36,533
- No problem, Officer.

1268
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:37,367
- Yes, sir.

1269
01:05:39,003 --> 01:05:39,936
- Thank you.

1270
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,171
- You have a great night.

1271
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:46,576
(struggling)

1272
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:47,411
- Don't move.

1273
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:48,979
- Don't flinch.

1274
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:52,349
You shoot me, and
 this knife is gonna

1275
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:54,618
go through you like a saw.

1276
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:56,686
(groaning)

1277
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:57,621
- Are they gone?

1278
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:59,289
- How am I supposed to know?

1279
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:00,624
- Take this knife outta my leg.

1280
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:02,526
- Take the gun outta my face.

1281
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:06,296
(grunting)

1282
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:09,066
(hard breathing)

1283
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:14,604
- They're gone. They're gone.

1284
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:18,408
- So what are we gonna do now?

1285
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:21,045
- You're gonna take
the knife outta my leg.

1286
01:06:21,045 --> 01:06:22,346
(chuckling)

1287
01:06:22,346 --> 01:06:24,614
- You and I, we're done.

1288
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:25,449
- Oh yeah.

1289
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:28,118
- So is this how it's gonna end?

1290
01:06:29,286 --> 01:06:30,754
- Seems a little too
 easy, doesn't it?

1291
01:06:30,754 --> 01:06:32,022
- Much too easy.

1292
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:35,992
- I'll give you a
 five-minute start.

1293
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,728
- Five minutes,
 five minutes it is.

1294
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:39,963
Which way are you headed?

1295
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:44,501
- The bedroom.

1296
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,436
- Don't wake up Becky.

1297
01:06:47,571 --> 01:06:49,939
(groaning)

1298
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:51,841
Need any help with that?

1299
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,411
- Look, your five
 minutes are ticking.

1300
01:06:54,411 --> 01:06:56,713
- Tick tock, tick tock,
tick tock, tick tock.

1301
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:00,417
Don't bother
 pointing that at me.

1302
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,454
- What makes you think I
 won't shoot you right now?

1303
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:07,191
- Because that would take
 all the phone outta the game.

1304
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:15,265
(soft dramatic music)

1305
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:17,467
- That son of a bitch
 thinks he can kill me.

1306
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:19,936
What do you think about
 that, my little pet, huh?

1307
01:07:21,105 --> 01:07:22,772
Fucker thinks he's
 gonna leave me.

1308
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,542
Thinks he's better
 than me, God dammit.

1309
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:26,776
(Kris shrieking)

1310
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,346
Shut up! You shut
 your fucking mouth!

1311
01:07:29,346 --> 01:07:30,914
Right now, shut up!

1312
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:33,817
Keep your fucking mouth
shut! Do you hear me?

1313
01:07:33,817 --> 01:07:35,752
(Kris shrieking)

1314
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:36,586
Shut it!

1315
01:07:39,123 --> 01:07:40,257
Did he fuck you?

1316
01:07:40,257 --> 01:07:41,091
- No.

1317
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,594
- Did he fuck you?

1318
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:45,795
- No, no.

1319
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:46,663
- Do you swear?

1320
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:47,497
- Yes.

1321
01:07:49,466 --> 01:07:52,269
- Then prove it.
 Prove yourself to me.

1322
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:54,704
Come on, you know how.

1323
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:56,206
Prove it.

1324
01:07:56,206 --> 01:07:57,006
Now.

1325
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,645
Pathetic.

1326
01:08:01,645 --> 01:08:05,282
It's too bad. I'll
 be sorry to lose you.

1327
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:07,050
- Are you gonna kill me now?

1328
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:07,984
- I'm not sure.

1329
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:12,489
I'm not sure. That depends
 on you, my little sweet.

1330
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:14,924
Here, come on, up.

1331
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:15,859
Up ... now.

1332
01:08:17,561 --> 01:08:18,828
(sobbing)

1333
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,230
You're gonna give
 me a little help.

1334
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:23,467
Look out, walk.

1335
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:27,604
(soft dramatic music)

1336
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:45,455
- Daddy?

1337
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:48,992
Daddy?

1338
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,363
- You should be sleeping.

1339
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:56,700
- Why are you and Mom fighting?

1340
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:01,004
- Why did you tell
 her that I hurt you?

1341
01:09:01,004 --> 01:09:02,472
- I didn't tell her anything.

1342
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:05,209
- Please don't lie to me, Becky.

1343
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:08,678
- But, Daddy, I didn't
 tell Mom you hurt me.

1344
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:12,716
- Mom said you told her that I,

1345
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:16,986
that I touched
 you in bad places.

1346
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,155
- No I didn't, Daddy.

1347
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,690
You would never hurt me.

1348
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,159
- Unlike your mother.

1349
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,462
- I love you, Daddy.

1350
01:09:25,462 --> 01:09:27,864
I would never say
anything bad about you.

1351
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:31,668
- I don't know if I believe you.

1352
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,770
- But, Daddy, I love you.

1353
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,509
- I'm leaving you tonight.

1354
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,778
- No, Daddy, don't go, please.

1355
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:42,612
- Becky.

1356
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:43,447
- Don't leave.

1357
01:09:43,447 --> 01:09:44,281
- Becky, stop.

1358
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:45,749
- Daddy, no.

1359
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:46,616
- Stop, Becky.

1360
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:47,851
- Daddy, please.

1361
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:50,186
No, Daddy, don't go, please.

1362
01:09:51,255 --> 01:09:53,423
Don't leave, Daddy, please.

1363
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:55,825
(whimpering)

1364
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:00,230
- Do you see him,
 do you see him?

1365
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,064
- No.

1366
01:10:02,599 --> 01:10:03,700
No.

1367
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,437
(soft dramatic music)

1368
01:10:07,437 --> 01:10:09,839
(whimpering)

1369
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:15,979
- [Charles] Deborah?

1370
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:17,947
Deborah, where are you?

1371
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:19,483
- [Deborah] Are you
 ready to do this?

1372
01:10:19,483 --> 01:10:21,451
- [Charles] There's
been a change of plans.

1373
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:23,287
- What are you talking about?

1374
01:10:23,287 --> 01:10:25,021
- [Charles] I have Becky.

1375
01:10:25,021 --> 01:10:27,791
I'm tired of the lying,
 Deborah, I'm tired of it all.

1376
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:30,093
(soft dramatic music)

1377
01:10:30,093 --> 01:10:31,561
- Let her go, Charles.

1378
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,630
- [Charles] No, I'm done.

1379
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,565
And you're not gonna
 hurt her anymore.

1380
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:38,101
- You leave her
 outta this, Charles.

1381
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:41,170
Becky, baby. Honey,
 are you okay?

1382
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:43,507
Becky?

1383
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:45,542
Shut up.

1384
01:10:47,311 --> 01:10:51,014
Charles, if you hurt her,

1385
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:55,985
I swear to God, I'm
 gonna make you suffer.

1386
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:59,889
Answer me, Charles.
 Where is she?

1387
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:00,957
Where is my baby?

1388
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:06,195
(Kris whimpering)

1389
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:08,031
- [Charles] Shit,
 where'd she go?

1390
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,599
(hand slapping)

1391
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,868
(groaning)

1392
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:16,873
(fists striking)

1393
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:19,142
(groaning)

1394
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:26,783
(straining)

1395
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:30,286
(dramatic music)

1396
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,056
(fists striking)

1397
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:40,797
- Kris, honey, come
 here, my little pet.

1398
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,632
I want you to help
 me with something.

1399
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:44,334
Kris?

1400
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:46,736
Kris!

1401
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:48,638
(groaning)

1402
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:49,506
- God dammit.

1403
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:51,174
- This is fucked up.

1404
01:11:51,174 --> 01:11:52,175
(groaning)

1405
01:11:52,175 --> 01:11:53,810
The pet's escaped, she's gone.

1406
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,244
Stop.

1407
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:56,446
- Shit.

1408
01:11:56,446 --> 01:11:57,280
- Fuck.

1409
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,516
(groaning)

1410
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:02,218
- Get the fuck off me.

1411
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:05,121
(groaning)

1412
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:07,056
- That hurt, you fuck.

1413
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:09,393
(moaning)

1414
01:12:09,393 --> 01:12:11,728
(whimpering)

1415
01:12:11,728 --> 01:12:14,498
(hard breathing)

1416
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,634
- Help!

1417
01:12:25,108 --> 01:12:26,510
(screaming)

1418
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:28,545
(crying)

1419
01:12:28,545 --> 01:12:33,149
She's dead!

1420
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:35,919
* Lullaby, don't you cry

1421
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:37,053
- Shut up!

1422
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:38,388
* Go to sleep

1423
01:12:38,388 --> 01:12:41,825
- Shut up, she's
 fine! Becky is fine!

1424
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:45,395
* When you close your eyes

1425
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,598
- No! No, she's dead.

1426
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:50,133
- She's not dead.

1427
01:12:54,137 --> 01:12:54,938
Let me kill her.

1428
01:12:56,906 --> 01:12:58,608
- We kill her together.

1429
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,346
(groaning)

1430
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:04,180
- Oh.

1431
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:10,754
Mm.

1432
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:12,422
- That was incredible.

1433
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:16,960
- I know. Stupid bitch got
 everything she deserved.

1434
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,162
(chuckling)

1435
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:21,330
(moaning)

1436
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:26,102
- How's Becky?

1437
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:30,507
- She's fine.

1438
01:13:32,008 --> 01:13:32,842
She's just fine.

1439
01:13:35,512 --> 01:13:36,580
- That was good.

1440
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:39,048
- (laughs) That was great.

1441
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:41,350
Oh.

1442
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:44,454
- Just like old times.

1443
01:13:44,454 --> 01:13:45,288
- Yeah.

1444
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:49,726
You remember your
 first girlfriend?

1445
01:13:50,727 --> 01:13:51,628
What was her name?

1446
01:13:53,463 --> 01:13:54,564
- Rhonda?

1447
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:57,834
- Oh, Rhonda, uh-huh.

1448
01:13:57,834 --> 01:14:02,438
Oh, you slept with me and then
 you felt guilty for cheating.

1449
01:14:03,473 --> 01:14:04,273
- Yeah.

1450
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,108
- Yeah, oh.

1451
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:08,578
Boy, she sure did
 scream when I smashed

1452
01:14:08,578 --> 01:14:10,847
her head into the
 counter, didn't she?

1453
01:14:12,616 --> 01:14:15,218
- I thought old Rhonda was
 dead, right then and there.

1454
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:17,687
- Yeah, but she wasn't (laughs).

1455
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:21,157
Oh.

1456
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:23,126
- No, she wasn't.

1457
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,728
We spent hours on her.

1458
01:14:24,728 --> 01:14:25,562
- Mm-hm.

1459
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,865
Oh.

1460
01:14:28,865 --> 01:14:29,966
- Deborah?

1461
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,067
- Yeah?

1462
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:34,804
- Do you think we
 can work this out?

1463
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:35,639
- Why?

1464
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:38,842
Why would I want to?

1465
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:43,847
(flesh tearing)

1466
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:46,082
(groaning)

1467
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,384
- You bitch.

1468
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:49,619
- Oh, I'm just
 getting warmed up.

1469
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:52,188
Oh!

1470
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:54,457
(groaning)

1471
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:56,793
Oh, shit.

1472
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:01,598
(groaning)

1473
01:15:03,466 --> 01:15:04,934
Son of a bitch.

1474
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:08,371
(groaning)

1475
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:14,711
Oh.

1476
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:15,545
Oh.

1477
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:18,782
(groaning)

1478
01:15:20,717 --> 01:15:23,452
(hard breathing)

1479
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:30,894
(gun cocking)

1480
01:15:30,894 --> 01:15:33,296
(gun firing)

1481
01:15:34,698 --> 01:15:35,765
Shit.

1482
01:15:35,765 --> 01:15:38,501
(hard breathing)

1483
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,508
(groaning)

1484
01:15:45,508 --> 01:15:48,678
(soft dramatic music)

1485
01:15:58,254 --> 01:15:59,088
- Ah.

1486
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:02,692
(groaning)

1487
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:06,996
(groaning)

1488
01:16:06,996 --> 01:16:09,633
(hard breathing)

1489
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:12,802
(soft dramatic music)

1490
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,810
(moaning)

1491
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:23,512
(hard breathing)

1492
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:26,683
(soft dramatic music)

1493
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,762
(hard breathing)

1494
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:15,665
- [Deborah] So this
 is how it ends?

1495
01:17:19,703 --> 01:17:21,470
(gun firing)

1496
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,707
(groaning)

1497
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:26,309
Oh God.

1498
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:29,612
(soft dramatic music)

1499
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:30,446
- Touche.

1500
01:17:31,547 --> 01:17:33,817
(groaning)

1501
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:38,521
- Where's the gun?

1502
01:17:41,725 --> 01:17:42,826
- Right here.

1503
01:17:45,929 --> 01:17:47,263
- Just give it up.

1504
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:51,400
- Never.

1505
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:56,139
(groaning)

1506
01:17:56,139 --> 01:17:59,709
(soft dramatic music)

1507
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:02,511
- I never thought it
 would end this way.

1508
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:06,615
- You knew it
 would end this way.

1509
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:09,385
(hard breathing)

1510
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,890
- You mean with a
 gun in my hands?

1511
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:16,125
I never saw that.

1512
01:18:19,829 --> 01:18:21,230
- Yeah, I see what you mean.

1513
01:18:23,566 --> 01:18:25,234
I figured you
 woulda poisoned me.

1514
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:29,338
(crying)

1515
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:30,473
- You know me too well.

1516
01:18:31,507 --> 01:18:32,641
- Uh-huh.

1517
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:35,078
(soft music)

1518
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:42,251
You were always so
 good about that.

1519
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:45,454
- About what?

1520
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,857
(soft music)

1521
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:52,762
- About knowing me.

1522
01:18:55,999 --> 01:19:00,937
You ... you were the only
 man that ever really knew me.

1523
01:19:06,442 --> 01:19:09,078
- I guess that's why we
stayed together so long.

1524
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:12,581
- Yeah.

1525
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:13,983
We were good, huh?

1526
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:16,886
(soft piano music)

1527
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:20,656
We were really, really good.

1528
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,559
- What about Becky?

1529
01:19:24,861 --> 01:19:25,694
- Becky.

1530
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:33,269
Becky's,

1531
01:19:35,071 --> 01:19:36,305
Becky's dead.

1532
01:19:42,378 --> 01:19:44,814
(groaning)

1533
01:19:44,814 --> 01:19:47,917
- Did you really
 ever stop loving me?

1534
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:51,187
- No.

1535
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:52,288
No, I didn't.

1536
01:19:55,959 --> 01:19:58,161
No, I,

1537
01:19:58,161 --> 01:19:59,062
I still love you.

1538
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,070
I just can't live with you.

1539
01:20:09,672 --> 01:20:11,107
- I love you too.

1540
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:14,710
(groaning)

1541
01:20:21,084 --> 01:20:23,652
(upbeat music)

1542
01:20:39,435 --> 01:20:41,237
* In the midnight hour

1543
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:46,209
* Crimson flowers wilt
 and hang their heads *

1544
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:50,813
* But I remember when we loved

1545
01:20:50,813 --> 01:20:55,084
* To drink the blood we bled

1546
01:20:55,084 --> 01:20:59,956
* Two sharp knives,
 we pierced the flesh *

1547
01:20:59,956 --> 01:21:04,860
* And planted seeds inside

1548
01:21:06,095 --> 01:21:08,697
* We schemed to take
 this crazy world *

1549
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:13,702
* And skin it of its hide

1550
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,305
* Love is pain

1551
01:21:16,305 --> 01:21:18,507
* And life is death

1552
01:21:18,507 --> 01:21:20,509
* Ironic, so it goes

1553
01:21:20,509 --> 01:21:25,381
* That blood and roses,
 wine and flesh don't make *

1554
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,550
* The garden grow

1555
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:30,019
* Killing's a bitch

1556
01:21:30,019 --> 01:21:34,924
* And this bitch is killing me

1557
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:39,862
* This bitch is killing me

1558
01:21:39,862 --> 01:21:43,399
* Remember back
 when we were young *

1559
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:48,404
* How we killed without shame

1560
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:52,341
* Nothing brings
 two lovers closer *

1561
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:57,313
* Than dishing out some pain

1562
01:21:58,347 --> 01:22:01,017
* A murder here,
a murder there *

1563
01:22:01,017 --> 01:22:05,989
* My poison blade, her hand

1564
01:22:05,989 --> 01:22:10,059
* An endless
 honeymoon we spent *

1565
01:22:10,059 --> 01:22:15,064
* Dancing with the dead

1566
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:19,602
* Love is pain and
 life is death *

1567
01:22:19,602 --> 01:22:23,272
* Ironic, so it goes
 and blood and roses, *

1568
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:26,075
* Wine and flesh don't make

1569
01:22:26,075 --> 01:22:28,477
* The garden grow

1570
01:22:28,477 --> 01:22:31,247
* Killing's a bitch

1571
01:22:31,247 --> 01:22:35,818
* And this bitch is killing me

1572
01:22:35,818 --> 01:22:40,023
* This bitch is killing me

1573
01:22:40,023 --> 01:22:44,627
* This bitch is killing me

1574
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:49,632
* This bitch is killing me

1575
01:22:51,034 --> 01:22:52,535
* If you think for a second
 you can get out now, *

1576
01:22:52,535 --> 01:22:54,603
* Squeeze through a
 loophole in our vows *

1577
01:22:54,603 --> 01:22:56,972
* While saying that
 you still love me *

1578
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,941
* And slide a knife
 into my back *

1579
01:22:58,941 --> 01:23:01,110
* Or poison me to heart attack

1580
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:03,079
* Our skeletons in the closet

1581
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:05,381
* There's no way out
 when love has died *

1582
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:09,018
* What good, you can't hide

1583
01:23:09,018 --> 01:23:11,587
(upbeat music)

1584
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:28,604
* In the midnight
hour, crimson flowers *

1585
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:31,207
* Wilt and hang their heads

1586
01:23:31,207 --> 01:23:36,212
* But I remember when we loved
 to drink the blood we bled *

1587
01:23:37,113 --> 01:23:40,449
* Two sharp knives, we pierced

1588
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:42,118
* The flesh

1589
01:23:42,118 --> 01:23:45,721
* We schemed to take
 this crazy world *

1590
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:48,824
* And skin it of its hide

1591
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:53,829
* Now that love has died,
 there's nowhere left to hide *

1592
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:59,335
* Life is pain and
 love is death *

1593
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:04,006
* Love is pain and
 life is death *

1594
01:24:04,006 --> 01:24:08,177
* Ironic, so it goes
that blood and roses, *

1595
01:24:08,177 --> 01:24:13,149
* Wine and flesh don't
 make the garden grow *

1596
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:15,884
* Killing's a bitch

1597
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:20,689
* And this bitch is killing me

1598
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:24,693
* This bitch is killing me

1599
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:29,398
* This bitch is killing me

1600
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:33,769
* This bitch is killing me

1601
01:24:33,769 --> 01:24:36,905
* This is bitch killing me
