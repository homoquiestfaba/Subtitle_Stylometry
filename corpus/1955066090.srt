You call it the luck of the Irish.

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,599
I'm exactly what the game needs.
I'm an entertainer.

6
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,319
I'm always conscious of the man
in the street who pays a fiver,

7
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,479
and that man wants to see fast play.

8
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,839
If I can help someone escape that dreary,

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,399
working-class environment, then
that's not a bad thing, is it?

10
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,720
You just get my name right in the
papers, it's Alexander the Great.

11
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,879
I thought we agreed on Hurricane.
Hurricane Higgins.

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,320
THEY CHEER

13
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,759
Just there, on the left.

00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,919
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome to the Pot Black studio,

15
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,560
the 1972 world snooker champion,
Alex "Hurricane" Higgins.

16
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,439
Excuse me, Mr Higgins. Mr Higgins!
It's just we do have a dress code.

17
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,479
I know you do, Ted, and
I'd love to wear that,

18
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,879
but I can't do the tie on
account of my neck disease.

19
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,519
You do know I have a
neck disease, don't you?

20
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,679
It's the same one that afflicts the
violinists. I have a doctor's note.

21
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,800
Come on in, you can read it for yourself.

22
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,279
Mr Higgins, I must ask you
not to urinate in the sink.

24
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,240
Forgive me, Ted. I'd introduce
you, but I don't know their names.

25
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,999

Excuse me.

30
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,599
I was wondering if you
might provide me with some

31
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,760
information about the tables and the
facilities in this establishment.

32
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,279
You know, what the, er,
pockets are like and the, er,

33
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,040
and the... the slate.

34
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,680
Do you need me to call your mum?

35
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,840

The snooker player?

45
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,200
What's snooker?

46
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
Excuse me.

47
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,360
Please, what's your name?

48
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,360

00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,959
- What are you doing?
- I don't know, he's been at it about an hour.

51
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,480
- Is this the lad?
- Yeah.

52
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,719
God, he's pale, isn't he?

53
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,119
I bet he gets sunburnt
when he opens the fridge.

54
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,799
He's thin and all.

55
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,320
I've seen more meat on
Linda McCartney's fork.

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,679
He doesn't say much, does he?

57
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,319
He's like Marcel Marceau in a library.

58
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Parlez-vous the English, senorita?

59
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,639
Sorry, Mr Hearn. I did find
your jokes very funny,

60
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,199
but I like to concentrate
when I'm practising.

61
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,199
- Do you want a drink, Davis? It is Steve Davis, isn't it?
- Yes.

62
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,679
Yes, it is, Mr Hearn. That's very kind.
Milk, please.

63
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,520
- Cold milk is fine.
- What, you don't drink?

64
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,479
I like an eggnog.

65
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,520
You know, at Christmas and...

66
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,839
No, actually, I don't like it.

67
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,639
What do you do, then? Apart from snooker?

68
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,039
Smoke? Gamble? Drugs? Girls?

69
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,199
Boys? Inflatable dolls?

70
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,159
- I play mental chess.
- Is he any good?

71
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,639
I don't know, boss, I
can't play mental chess.

72
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,799
- No, at snooker, you wally!
- Oh, yeah.

78
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,559
- I tried phoning.
- I know. 20 times.

79
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,160
I'm not great with the phone. I
thought I'd charm you in person.

80
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,039
Look, I'm sorry about the other night.

81
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,679
I'm not really like that.

82
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,959
Really? That's not what I've heard.

83
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,159
I'm sometimes like that, but I
can tell you deserve better.

84
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,439
Let me take you out.

85
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,360
What's the worst that can happen?

86
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,359
Now, the trick is, keep
the bottom one still

87
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,399
and get the top one to
pinch the food together.

88
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,640
Like this.

89
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,999

92
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,279
I know.

93
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,160
I haven't changed a bit.

94
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,479
- Sandy? That's a girl's name.
- That's what my big sisters call me.

95
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,039
- They look like they can keep you out of trouble.
- I wish.

96
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,519
- No, I'm always on the road.
- Don't tell me.

97
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,080
- Hurricane Higgins gets lonely.
- It's not all razzmatazz, Lynn.

98
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,479
I can be playing in front of 1,000 people,

99
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,119
all the people at home
watching on the telly.

100
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,679
But I'm a snooker player.

101
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,800
In the end, you're always on your own.

102
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,959
Me mates were right.

103
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,760
Hurricane Higgins is a right flash bastard.

104
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,720

- Pint of lager.

It'll do wonders for the kid.
He's good, but he's green,

You know, Baz, I'm sorry, but
I can't keep my eyes open.

What do you say we make this interesting?

125
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,720
If you say so, Alex.

126
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,920
Looks like I've found my

Well done. We'll have a

So, what do you think of the lad?

141
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,439
I don't. I'd have killed
him in a proper match.

142
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,919
Without this bunch of hooligans, I mean.

143
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,479
This place is a fucking disgrace.

144
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,039
That top cushion has got more
bounce than a pair of Page 3 tits.

145
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,080
Thanks for coming, Alex.

146
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,199
Get that man a pint!

147
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,719

CHEERING

151
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,679
I've been waiting a long time
to meet a man like you, Davis.

152
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,639
I bet that's something you
don't hear very often.

153
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,319
HE CHUCKLES

154
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,919
You see, I think snooker is
going to be big. Properly big.

155
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,079
Bigger even than wrestling.

156
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,719
I'm being serious.

157
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,999
And I want us to go into
partnership together.

158
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,079
We can be like Giant
Haystacks and Big Daddy.

159
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,239
Do you mean, like, what, 50/50?

160
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,719
Jesus, Davis! I was only going to take ten.

161
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,199
I think you'd better let me
do the haggling from now on.

162
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,759
Look, you just pot the balls, and
I'll take care of everything else.

163
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,759
Everything what else?

164
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,439
I'm going to make you - and me -

165
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,800
very, very rich.

166
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,080
How's that sound?

167
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,199
Jesus, Davis, it's like
strangling a lettuce.

168
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,040
Come here, you big nugget.

169
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,000
I hope that's your snooker cue.

170
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,840
Ha-ha-ha!

171
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,759
That's it! That's what the
grannies like to see.

172
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,399
A nice, clean-cut,
well-dressed young man...

173
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,319
- bending over a table.
- Barry...

174

little early, but believe it or not,

348
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,439
'they are already playing
snooker here on this Monday

349
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,199
'at the Embassy World Professional
Championships in Sheffield.

350
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,280
'No doubt we will be talking about
the pressure shots and the tension.

351
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,079
'So, the psychological battles
which have always been evident

352
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,440
'behind the scenes in this World
Championship have begun again.'

353
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,519
Bye, Angel Face.

354
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,039
Touch my cue for luck.

355
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,279
There you go.

356
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,279
Daddy's got to go to work.

357
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,040
- Good luck.
- All right.

358
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,680
- Alex.
- Fuck off.

359
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,759
Steve.

360
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,279
Oh, I don't know if you heard,
but I just had a little girl.

361
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,999
Lauren, her name is. I was at the birth.

362
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,319
Yeah, and to be honest with you,

363
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,999
it was the most disgusting
thing I've ever seen.

364
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,599
Blood everywhere.

365
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,159
I mean, the doctors, they warned me,

366
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,279
what happens at the
business end during birth.

367
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,040
But I said I'd be all
right, that I'd cope...

368
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,919
..cos I knew Steve Davis and
he's the world's biggest cunt.

369
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,319
Go on, my son. Go on, Steve.

370
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,440
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

371
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,840
Give me a vodka.

372
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,360
That was beautiful.

373
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,359
What'll it be, Steve?

374
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,039
What d'you say, Barry?

375
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,159
Is he allowed to stop and have a
drink, or is he too good for us?

376
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,359
Too good for you? LAUGHS

377
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,959
Come on, Alex, give me a challenge.

378
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,879
Come on, you ginger twat.

379
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,839
- You can't play Space Invaders all the time.
- I'll buy you a drink.

380
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,279
- No, you won't, you buy me two fucking drinks.
- All right, done.

381
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,519
Two halves, it is.

382
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,159
Honestly, Barry. He's no good for the game.

383
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,799
You've gone and built a robot.

384
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,880
Who's going to want to watch that
when you can see a flair player?

385
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,919
A flair player?

386
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,440
That's hilarious. That just means you miss.

387
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,720
But at least I miss with style.

388
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,200
'That's it. The World Snooker
Champion, 1981, Steve Davis.'

389
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,759
You've done it. You done it.

390
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,520
I told you.

391
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,159
He done it!

392
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,440
Come on!

393
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,599
That's the most disgraceful goddamn
sight I've ever seen in snooker.

394
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,560
And I've known this piece of shit
for a decade, right, Bill? Up high.

395
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,199
Yes!

396
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,879
I just hope they spell his
name right on the trophy -

397
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,480
B-A-R-R-Y.

398
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,639
♪ Maybe get a blister on your little finger

399
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,199
♪ Maybe get a blister on your thumb

400
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,199
♪ We gotta install microwave ovens... ♪

401
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,919
Ten grand.

402
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,319
That's right, for the week.

403
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,719
No, Hamish, it's not lira.

404
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,319
That's pounds sterling.

405
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,679
You listen to me. You want
Ferrari, don't pay Ford prices.

406
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,199
OK, you come back to me, but
don't leave it too long.

407
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,920
Everyone wants a piece of Davis and
that price is only going to go up.

408
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,159
Davis, I want you to meet Brian,

409
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,519
he's going to write us your autobiography.

410
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,839
But I'm only 23.

411
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,119
It doesn't matter.

412
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,479
He's going to pad it
out, loads of diagrams.

413
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,560
That way, even Jimmy White can read it.

414
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,079
Barry, shouldn't I write my autobiography?

415
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,919
Davis, don't be a wally.

416
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,279
Even your biggest fan won't want
to wade through an entire chapter

417
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,399
on how to chalk a cue.

418
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,639
Besides, you'll need that magic
to write your column in the Star.

419
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,320
Here, Brian, they love him in the Star.
Look at that.

420
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,639
- You could have flexed your muscles.
- I did.

421
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,319
PHONE RINGS Hold on. Hamish, I bet you.

422
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,839
Barry Hearn.

423
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,319
Good man, Hamish. Right, so,
11 grand for the week, then.

424
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,839
Yeah. I know I said ten, but
that was two minutes ago.

425
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,920
I told you you've got to be quick.

426
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,759
Go on, then.

427
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,040
Who is it?

428
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,840
Well, in that case you'd
better make it 12½.

429
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,600
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

430
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,320
ICE CUBES RATTLE

431
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,760
HE BURPS

432
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,520
CROWD MURMURS

433
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,999
HE MOUTHS

434
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,679
Come on, Davis!

435
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,080
CROWD MURMURS

436
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,719
You all right, Davis?

437
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,359
No. No, I'm not.

438
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,399
There is only one word to
describe Alex Higgins.

439
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,999
- Obnoxious.
- I think there's a few more than that,

440
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,319
- but that's the one Brian'll put in the autobiography.
- All right.

441
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,679
But if he touches me again, then I'm
not responsible for what I might do.

442
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,959
Well, what will you do?

443
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,480
Probably go home.

444
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,560
All right, I'll sort it.

445
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,600
Steve Davis - 58.

446
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,120
- <
- Come on!

447
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,960
CROWD GASPS

448
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,639
Stamina. It's one aspect of the game
that is all too commonly forgotten.

449
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,719
Just because snooker players
don't chase a football,

450
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,759
it doesn't mean that we don't need
to be in a prime physical condition.

451
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,799
- As I was saying...
- Jesus, Brian. It's been a week.

452
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,879
Have you not finished yet?

453
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,439
Steve Davis is boring - the end.

454
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,519
Alex... I thought we had an agreement.

455
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,800
For God's sake!

456
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,800
One, two, three...

457
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,000
Thank you.

458
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,599
You know, I thought it was the idea
of Steve Davis I used to hate.

459
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,399
But now I've got to know
you a little better,

460
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,759
I actually hate Steve
Davis the man even more.

461
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,199
Yeah. Well, you're... you're drunk.

462
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,400
Yes, I am.

463
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,279
But in the morning, I shall be sober,

464
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,159
and you'll still be boring.

465
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,320
Alex, it is the morning.

466
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,319
All right, then, Davis. Are you all set?

467
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,079
I don't suppose you've got
room in the car for one more?

468
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,679
I do, as it happens. Brian, snap to it.

469
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,519
HE SIGHS

470
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,359
You know I can't drive myself.
Don't be like that.

471
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,319
I think there's something you need
to talk to your own manager about,

472
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,399
whoever that currently is.

473
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,799
- I intend to.
- Room number, sir?

474
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,280
I'm not staying here.

475
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,520
I can't afford to.

476
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,559
- Right...
- Let me see that.

477
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,879
That is very generous of you, Alex.
Thank you.

478
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,519
Well, you must have got
a good deal for Davis.

479
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,999
- Just imagine what I earn for this trip.
- I don't have to. I know.

480
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,919
Two grand. I got more than that.

481
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,159
Thank you. Most enjoyable.

482
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,079
Well, I wouldn't sign for
you, even if you asked me.

483
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,119
That's good, cos I'm not asking.

484
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,359
Pride, Barry, it's a terrible thing.

485
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,479
You'd snap my hand off.

486
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,599
Where is he? Where's Beadle?

487
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,159
I don't need anyone to hold my hand
and put my suitcase in the car,

488
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,759
but I know you're a bit of a whizz
on the old pocket calculator.

489
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,079
Wait a minute - are you asking me?
No chance!

490
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,719
I'll always be the biggest
draw in the game.

491
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,200
So fuck you and fuck... Davis.

492
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,759
You see, it's that attitude

493
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,079
that has no place in what
I'm trying to build here

494
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,439
- with an ethos of impeccable professionalism...
- Fuck you!

495
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,039
- I don't want to join.
- ..and politeness at all times.

496
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,760
How am I supposed to market
someone as rude as you to IBM?

497
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,839
That is a disgraceful slur
on my character, Barry,

498
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,399
and fuck IBM!

499
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,719
Their computers are shite.

500
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,479
And what's that got to do with snooker?

501
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,479
The world's changing, Alex.

502
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,639
My new Matchroom stable recognises that.

503
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,759
CAR ENGINE STARTS

504
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,039
My new Matchroom stable recognises...(!)

505
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,559
Well, I'm not changing

506
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,439
and I'd certainly never change for you.

507
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,720
You know what the people want? Me!

508
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,400
This is the box office!

who are going to have a game
of snooker against each other.

Yeah, yeah. Steve, that's great, but, um,

771
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,039
we know you can play snooker.

772
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,839
The idea is to interview the
guests at the same time.

773
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,559
- Sorry, was I in the zone again?
- No, Steve, you're doing great, OK?

774
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,239
Just ask me a question. Fire away.

783
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,039
- I'm sorry, Barry, this isn't really me, is it?
- Granted, granted,

784
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,999
but then that's not really you,
either, is it, when you're playing?

785
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,479
That's more like tournament Steve.

786
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,919

is a sort of third Steve,

787

- personality Steve.
- But I'm boring.

- I don't know any jokes.

791
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,919

OK. All right.

00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,479
We'll do it once more. OK? This time,

802
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,199

- Alex, I'm pregnant!

828
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,679
- I can't do everything by myself.
- Well, I'm world champion.

829

- Pardon?

much of you as I can take,

855
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,680
so think very carefully

00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,839
I'm sorry, love.

869
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,119
All right, all right, fine.

870
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,239
Fine, fine.

871
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,399
- Still fucking minted.
- Fuck you!

872
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,519
Oh, Jesus Christ! Come on, honestly!

873
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,079
HE GASPS Little shit-stain!

874
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,119
HE LAUGHS

875
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,999
Oh, no, yes. We do have a laugh.

876
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,759
When I got asked to come and do this show,

877
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,359
I said, "You do know I'm
boring, don't you?"

878
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,199
And they said, "How boring?"

879
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,599
I said, "I'm so boring, my
nickname is Steve Davis."

880
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,239
LAUGHTER

881
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,199
I'm glad you find that one funny.

882
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,199
- Go on, my son.
- My shot, is it?

883
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,479
'A very good morning to you.

884
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,439
'And if you were planning anything
else today, I would cancel it.

885
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,999
'Because I think we are in store here
for the most interesting day yet

886
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,439
'in the 1983 Embassy Professional
Snooker Championship Of The World.

887
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:44,759
'Right, the start of day 14.
Alex Higgins and Steve Davis.

888
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,439
'And we will be with the semifinals
right throughout the day

889
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,959
'and throughout the evening...'

890
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,800
- ANNOUNCER: This match needs little introduction...
- Here we are, Cagney and fucking Lacey.

891
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,560
You know no-one has ever won two in a row?

892
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,920
- Before now, that is.
- I hope I win, Alex, for your sake.

893
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,239
Someone's got to stop you
celebrating the last one.

894
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,399
HE SNORTS

895
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,039
- Since when does he make jokes?
- Since he got his own chat show.

896
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,719
- ..world number one, Steve Davis!
- Go on, son.

897
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,600
CHEERING

898
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:24,559
And please welcome the defending
Embassy World Snooker Champion,

899
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,839
Alex "Hurricane" Higgins!

900
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,160
CHEERING

901
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,480
BABY CRIES

902
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,640
DOOR SLAMS

903
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,560
I know, I miss you, too. But...

904
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,559
I can't come home, I'm
playing an exhibition match.

905
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,879
'So, this exhibition match,
who are you playing?'

906
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,159
- Jimmy.
- DOOR OPENS

907
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,479
I'll be there in a minute,
just give me a minute, Jimmy.

908
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,359
Higgins, you pig. Have
you finished with these?

909
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,959
- 'Who was that?'
- Nobody.

910
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,719
I'm not nobody. I'm Oliver fucking Reed.

911
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,079
Oh, and Ollie Reed is here as well.

912
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,199
GIGGLING IN BACKGROUND

913
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,520
'Shut up!'

914
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,800
He's keeping score.

915
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,079
Shut up!

916
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,559
Lynn?

917
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,840
Oh, fuck.

918
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,159
Lynn, just calm down. Tell
me, what have I done?

919
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,479
'Alex, you're never at home.'

920
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,799
I'm at home now.

921
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,759
- Listen, it's worse when you are at home.
- You see, there you go.

922
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,199
- I can't win.
- Look, I don't want our kids to see you pissed all the time.

923
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,959
So I like a drop of drink. If
that's the worst of our problems...

924
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,759
Alex, I am worried I'm going
to end up getting AIDS!

925
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,799
CHUCKLES

926
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,599
Lynn, I swear on my life,
I'm not into fellas.

927
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,679
Alex, you are not listening to me.

928
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:06,159
Look, I know I'm not a model husband, OK?
I admit that. But...

929
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,399
I love you. Right, if you want
me to change, I'll change.

930
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,919
No, I...

931
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,199
Listen, I want you to, I really
do, but you will never change.

932
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,199
I'll never give up my family.

933
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,119
The Hurricane never gives up.

934
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:23,200
- Come home, Lynn.
- I can't do it, I'm sorry.
- Come...
- Alex, I said no.

935
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,120
Come on, mate. You can sort this.

936
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,839
My Maureen gets like this.

937
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,160
A bit antsy.

938
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,079
Then she calms down and, you know,

939
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,920
we just carry on like it never happened.

940
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,559
Until the next time.

941
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,039
HE CHUCKLES

942
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,080
That's what marriage is.

943
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,160
Come on, follow me, I'll give you the tour.

944
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,479
Kitchen, portable colour TV.

945
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,679
Dishwasher.

946
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,639
Microwave.

947
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:10,480
All you have to do all day is just...
sit around and push buttons.

948
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,839
Do you really think this is going
to solve all of our problems?

949
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,320
I know, we'll get an au pair, but...

950
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,039
..you have to admit, it's a
good place for a fresh start.

951
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:27,359
Alex, how many fresh starts can I give you?

952
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,680
I know.

953
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,600
I know, it's my final last chance, but...

954
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,719
You know the Hurricane is never better

955
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,839
then when his back is against the wall.

956
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,239
It's too big.

957
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,279
I'll be lonely when you're not here.

958
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,720
Oh, and the piece de resistance...

959
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,759
- My sn...
- Snooker room.

960
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,760
I can practise here. No more
going away for days on end.

961
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,039
- And I'm getting a new manager.
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

962
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,679
What, you don't think we
can afford it? We can.

963
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,319
Snooker has never been bigger
and I'm back to my best.

964
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,519
I meant I don't know if I'm ready, Alex.

965
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,799
I'll win 60 grand for
the Embassy next year.

966
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,599
- I'll build us a swimming pool.
- Can't even swim.

967
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,760
For you and the kids.

968
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:26,000
Imagine, little Lauren and Jordan,
playing out there, raising hell.

969
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,880
Be like a real family again.

970
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,119
I know that's what you want.

971
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,240
Really.

972
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,320
Please say yes, because...

973
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,879
..the truth is,

974
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,480
I've already bought it.

975
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,679
It is Monopoly meets KerPlunk.

976
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,559
- You think people are actually going to buy this?
- Course they will.

977
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,999
Especially... when I throw
in a pair of these.

978
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,439
- What have they got to do with snooker?
- Nothing.

979
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,439
That's the genius bit. PHONE RINGS

980
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,839
That phone is red-hot. It
will not stop ringing.

981
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,559
Buzby's working overtime and I
think I need a new fax machine.

982
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,919
Barry Hearn.

983
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,360
No, I do not know if the World
Champion drinks coffee.

984
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,840
Well, how much are we talking?

985
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,399
He loves the stuff. He can't get
enough of it, especially...

986
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,479
What brand did you say it was again?

987
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,200
Thank you very much.

988
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,239
Honestly...

989
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,320
Would you not rather have my
face on an advert than that?

990
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,839
Would you not say I'm a much sexier man?

991
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,880
Oh, yeah, much sexier.

992
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,359
Have you seen this one?

993
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,199
I don't read Women's Realm.

994
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,439
"If I had to choose between sex
and snooker, I'd choose snooker."

995
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,280
So would she!

996
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,039
Can you imagine that in bed?

997
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,840
Spend three minutes walking round
her lining up the fucking shot.

998
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,039
Probably chalks his bell-end.

999
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,919
He did win Rear Of The Year.

1000
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,680
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- When it was Sue Pollard.

1001
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,840
Listen, Alex, I can get you deals.

1002
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,880
Just got Tony Knowles
in with Vidal Sassoon.

1003
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,279
Right.

1004
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,519
Well... Tony can walk into
any Vidal Sassoon salon,

1005
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:34,519
anywhere in the country and
get himself a free haircut.

1006
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:39,680
I'm talking about getting me a TV
advert, not a free fucking haircut.

1007
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,479
Do you have any idea how
much this place cost me?

1008
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,759
I pay you 10%.

1009
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,239
And you just draw a blank.
A Blankety Blank.

1010
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,519
Why can't you even get me
on Blankety fucking Blank?

1011
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,760
People like winners.

1012
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,239
Alex, darling, can I get some money

1013
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,360
cos Caterina wants to
take Lauren into town?

1014
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:06,400
How am I meant to practise with all
these constant interruptions?!

1015
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,959
MUSIC: The Four Seasons by Antonio Vivaldi

1016
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,759
Excuse me.

1017
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,159
GENERAL CHATTER

1018
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,080
HE THUMPS DOOR

1019
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,160
What the fuck?

1020
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,679
Are you sure this is a snooker tournament?

1021
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,319
- This place is bigger than your house.
- Don't mention that money pit.

1022
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,720
I have to win this just
to pay the gas bill.

1023
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,879
What the fuck are you doing?

1024
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,600
It's the Goya Matchroom scent.

1025
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,079
It's the international fragrance
for the men who play to win.

1026
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,919
You wanna be a winner, you've
got to smell like a winner.

1027
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:59,159
It's a mix of fern needles, tarragon,
pimento, nutmeg, patchouli,

1028
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,159
musk, sandalwood and tonka beans.

1029
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,559
Hey, Grinder, what's all this shit?

1030
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,720
Beats me, thought we were
here to play goddamn snooker.

1031
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:22,039
I may be the People's Champion,
but not these fucking people.

1032
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,159
Fucking Romford lot.

1033
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,600
It's all just fake, innit?

1034
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,599
Barry, Barry!

1035
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,319
Can you get us a pint
of that Goya Matchroom?

1036

01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:54,040
So long as the terms of the
contract are right for me.

1209
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,399
"Lean, square-jawed, his good
looks and clean-cut behaviour

1210
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,960
"have made Steve Davis
the hero of Britain."

1211
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,799
This is what I'm building here, Alex.

1212
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,359
Courage Brewery have just
bought Steve Davis for a year.

1213
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:17,999
An exclusive contract - £1 million.

1214
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,919
So, unless I accidentally have a lobotomy,

1215
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,879
I'm not going to risk it all on you. Am I?

1216
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,119
Snooker needs me, Barry.

1217
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:31,640
Do you think people tune in hoping
to watch Davis play Tony Meo?

1218
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,079
I'm the box office - me.

1219
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,560
I know.

1220
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,399
You admit it, you bastard.

1221
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,159
You're right.

1222
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,279
We need you.

1223
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,679
The millions out there, they don't
tune in to watch the snooker,

1224
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:51,399
they watch for the soap opera.

1225
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,919
It's Dallas with balls.

1226
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,560
And you're JR and Bobby
Ewing rolled into one.

1227
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,159
You're destroying yourself.
And it's a fact of life

1228
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,159
that millions of people
enjoy watching the process,

1229
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:08,359
so, yeah, snooker needs you.

1230
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,080
But I don't need you.

1231
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,759
Barry, please.

1232
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,600
Please, I'm begging you.

1233
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,680
I need you to manage me.

1234
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,560
I can't manage on my own.

1235
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:32,719
I said I'd never change, well...

1236
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:35,519
I'll change.

1237
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,520
I'll do anything, Barry.

1238
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,360
I'm on my fucking knees here.

1239
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,840
I can't, Alex.

1240
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,959
I've lost everyone.

1241
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,679
And I've lost my house...

1242
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:54,280
all the money.

1243
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,480
Fucking Inland Revenue are after me.
You know?

1244
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:06,319
I'll even give up the drink, Barry.

1245
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,919
I promise.

1246
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:11,480
You wouldn't last a day, Alex. I-I'm sorry.

1247
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,199
We can do this.

1248
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:20,359
You know? I could change and...

1249
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,840
You're the only one who can help me.

1250
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,800
I've lost my family.

1251
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,159
Alex, you're a mess.

1252
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,560
Look, um...

1253
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,759
Look, where you headed to? I'll get
Robbo to give you a lift somewhere.

1254
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,600
I've nowhere to go.

1255
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,880
It's...

1256
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,400
I'm sure you know a boozer
open somewhere near here.

1257
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,880
Take it, Alex.

1258
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,680
Take care, Alex.

1259
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,759
COMMENTATOR: Alex Higgins concedes.

1260
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:18,959
Steve James has played exceptionally well.

1261
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,679
From 5-5 he won five frames in succession

1262
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,920
to win by 10 frames to 5.

1263
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:30,399
I actually owe Higgins my life.

1264
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:34,439
True story, right? I was getting
beaten up by three blokes

1265
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,039
and Alex walks round the corner and says,

1266
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,639
"That's probably enough now, lads."

1267
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,920
THEY LAUGH

1268
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,679
Alex.

1269
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,959
Hey, Alex.

1270
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,399
- Why are you even over? I ain't coming to your...
- Just saying, mate.

1271
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,720
- Get the fuck off.
- OK, man.

1272
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,960
Give me another drink, someone.

1273
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,280
How many's he had now?

1274
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,839
Maybe I should go down.

1275
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,519
No, Jimmy. Leave him.

1276
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,400
He won't thank you.

1277
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,360
One more.

1278
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,040
Alex.

1279
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,160
(Fuck off.)

1280
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,480
What are you doing down here?

1281
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,759
- Come to get you, Alex, come on.
- Fuck off.

1282
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,560
- They're turning the lights off, Alex.
- Don't need you to help me.

1283
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,440
I don't need anyone.

1284
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:14,360
I...fucking... quit.

1285
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,839
You can relax, we'll call it a draw.

1286
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:24,279
- I'm very sorry to hear that, Alex.
- No, you're not.

1287
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,639
You've got what you always wanted.

1288
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,679
You got rid of the Hurricane.

1289
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:33,119
You'll find out what it's like soon enough.

1290
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:36,879
Stephen Hendry will come along
and knock you off your perch

1291
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,920
and then you'll know what it's like.

1292
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,640
Why do you hate me?

1293
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:47,120
Come on, I don't hate you.
I've never hated you.

1294
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:49,920
I idolised you.

1295
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,839
When I watched you play I
thought it was genius.

1296
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:58,640
I wanted to be just like
Alex Higgins. Once.

1297
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,719
That's... That's... No.

1298
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:07,839
No, that's not true. We've...

1299
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,600
We've always been... enemies.

1300
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,879
I'm not your enemy, Alex.

1301
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,959
You are. And the drink.

1302
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:19,080
That's right, blame me. Everyone else does.

1303
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,120
You look after yourself.

1304
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,759
Remember this -

1305
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,559
I'll get the romantic
obituaries when I die.

1306
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,920
And you can keep the fucking money.

1307
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,080
Goodnight!
