00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,590
Pretty sharp for so
early in the morning.

18
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,360
Actually, I prefer to
think of it as the end

19
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,928
Of a long, enchanted evening.

20
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,230
Then I'd prefer
you didn't think.

21
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,030

Thank you.

Johnny will be

26
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:47,621
I'm so sorry about your wife.

27
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,190
If only I had believed sooner.

28
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,125
But who could have imagined?

29
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,861
The vampire's greatest
power is the fact

30
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,330
That nobody believes in him.

Would you like
some tea, Johnny?

No thanks, Karen.

How are you doing, Mr. Masey?

36
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,409
Depends on how you did.

37
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,563
Thank God.

38
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,899
Your wife wasn't
his final victim.

39
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,601
Sarah wanted him.

40
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,569
Well, if it's any
consolation, sir, it wasn't

41
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,471
Entirely voluntary on her part.

42
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,440
Evil can be most irresistible.

43
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,642
You resisted her.

44
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:42,943
She would have killed
me if you hadn't.

45
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,112
Well, I've had some
experience in these matters.

46
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,818
Well, I got what I paid for.

Karen, you look like
you've seen a ghost.

55
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,847
I find that professionally
embarrassing.

56
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,149
There's a Catherine
Coogan here to see you.

57
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,351
Does she have three
sixes on her forehead?

58

[Scoffs] No.

59
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,388
There's something about her.

Please be careful, Johnny.

61
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,925
OK, I'll take the
normal precautions.

62
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:32,726
Miss Coogan!

63
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:41,234
Are you the monk?

64
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,335
That's just a nickname.

65
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,707

71
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,368
I had to be sure.

72
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,804
Of what?

73
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,039
You're being what you appear
to be, a beautiful woman.

74
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,140
Not something else.

75
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,009
Thank you, I think.

00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,211
How can I help
you, Miss Coogan?

Blake, the kind no policeman

00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:32,753
Are we talking physical
or spiritual danger?

80
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:33,554
Both.

81
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,827
How'd you know to come to me?

82
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,896
There's an occult bookstore by
my law firm on Fourth and Erie,

Raven Books.

84
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,332

85
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:46,634
He's legitimate.

86
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:50,437
He said the monk could help
me break the family curse.

87
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:51,371
I see.

88
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,507

Well then, you have the floor.

00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,949
You may not know it by
looking at me, Mr. Blake,

93
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,051
But I'm from the backwoods.

94
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,820
I've spent a long time
camouflaging this fact

95

And educating myself.

96
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:13,861
But I was born and bred
in Golgotha County, a part

97
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,196
Of the country that
even good Christian folk

98
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,364
Might find forbidding.

That's right.

104
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,002
Mama minded the health stone.

You heard of it?

106
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:32,572
The mystic gem that
will allow Asmodeus

107
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,775
To cross into our
world, once it's

108
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,509
Saturated with human blood.

109
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,548
Mama came real close to making
that happen, about 28 years ago

110
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,350

And mama supplied the victims.

00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,526
She lived for the demons coming.

116
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:56,229
When it is written,
the sky will darken,

117
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,199
And his subjects
will rule the earth.

118
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,769
But his worshippers
needed one more sacrifice,

119
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:05,038
Or else they'd have to wait
for the next Walpurgis.

120
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,809
Then they'd found him,
the boy hitchhiker.

121

But on that day, mama's
beauty caught the eye

He kept her there the rest
of her days, part wife,

Part slave.

To escape the
demon's vengeance, he

Had the Hell stone
cut three ways

And sold to three
separate jewelers.

00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:15,668
The monk in their clutches,
to make you suffer

188
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:19,206
For all of us you killed.

189
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:24,244
But I have a much
better use for you.

190
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:29,449
Now, be a good boy and let
mommy give you your medicine.

191
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:38,225
[Gasp]

192
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:45,698
Huh, that wasn't so bad.

193
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,768
Now you're mine, Johnny Blake.

194
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,170
Kneel to me.

195
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,539
Like hell.

196
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,475
As you wish.

197
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,376
On your knees, monk.

198
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,955
Now, crawl to me.

199
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,390
[Gasping]

200
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,532
You want me, don't you, Johnny?

201
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,668
Why, sure you do.

202
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:25,672
Your little heart
just aches for me.

203
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,140
[Breathing heavily]

204
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:34,981
I never finished
telling you my story.

205
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,984
Would you like to
hear the rest of it?

206
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,387
I thought so.

207
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:45,958
You see, for my entire 20th
year, I didn't dread my fate.

208
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,394
I yearned for it.

209
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:54,133
And then at last it
came, in the form

210
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,737
Of this tall, silent stranger.

211
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:03,042
He gave me this ring containing
one third of the Hell stone.

212
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,447
Asmodeus' worshipers had
recovered the other two stones

213
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:10,717
Over the jeweler's dead bodies.

214
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,151
[Gasping]

215
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:25,765
Of course, I didn't know any
of this until I put the ring on.

216
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:29,602
Then everything
became crystal clear.

217
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,071
As the demon power
surged through me,

218
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,275
I was not longer
Catherine Coogan.

219
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:39,011
I was... I am... Sister Avarice.

220
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,967
Your sisters... the
other two rings.

221
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,335
Uh-huh.

222
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,137
Rings identical to mine.

223
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:09,742
Like me, each would
kill to keep hers.

224
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:15,648
But unlike them, I shall
possess all three gems.

225
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:19,986
For that I need your help.

226
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,354
You're the witch.

227
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:25,625
Why don't you get on your
broom and go get them.

228
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,926
Very funny, Johnny.

229
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:35,735
To defeat them, I need an
edge over their sorcery.

230
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:41,808
Someone strong and cunning, yet
completely under my control.

231
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,677
Who better than the monk?

232
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:48,581
The great demon slayer.

233
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,517
Listen well, Johnny.

234
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:54,387
Both my sisters are
here in this city.

235
00:20:54,487 --> 00:21:00,327
Jenny, Sister Anger, runs a
martial arts studio for women.

236
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:04,997
Caroline, Sister of Lust, runs
the most exclusive call girl

237
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,233
Ring in town.

238
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,469
I don't care what happens
to either of them,

239
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:12,271
As long as you bring me
their rings by sunset the day

240
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,073
After tomorrow.

241
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:16,476
You will be my pawn
in the coming match

242
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:20,279
And I will be the
last queen standing.

243
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:26,386
Do that, and I will reward you
with the pleasures of the dark.

244
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:32,191
Fail me and you'll beg
for the mercy of hell.

245
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:39,131
And remember, whatever
you do, wherever you go,

246
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,468
I'll be watching.

247
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:42,469
[Chuckles]

248
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,822
[Thunder]

249
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:23,796
[Thunder]

250
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:27,934
Johnny!

251
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,103
Johnny!

252
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:41,781
Are you home, Johnny?

253
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,750
[Thunder]

254
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:56,228
Johnny, what happened?

255
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,098
Get out.

256
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,266
Johnny, I was worried.

257
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,769
You didn't call or
answer the phone.

258
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,204
Or let you in.

259
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:06,573
[Sigh]

260
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,509
At least tell me what
happened out there.

261
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,477
You owe me that.

262
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:19,051
I um... I lost something.

263
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,320
What was it?

264
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,121
Myself.

265
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:34,801
I don't want to be forced
to hurt you, Karen.

266
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:37,804
Go on, get out.

267
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:40,272
I work for you.

268
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,774
Not anymore.

269
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:42,775
You're fired.

270
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,919
KAREN: Johnny, you can
hurt me all you want,

271
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,186
But I won't leave you like this.

272
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:54,987
Why not?

273
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,690
[Laughing]

274
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,827
Don't you know?

275
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:04,764
I thought the monk
knew everything.

276
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:05,698
He used to.

277
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,600
[Laughing]

278
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,342
For 10 years, I've fought
the powers of darkness,

279
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,777
Since the night my
mother and sister

280
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:19,145
Greeted me with vampire kisses.

281
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,620
I've survived by
resisting temptation,

282
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,555
But now the evil's within me.

283
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,298
So's the good.

284
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:45,938
Johnny!

285
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,406
What is it?

286
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:48,908
What's wrong with you?

287
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,376
Oh, it's started.

288
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:07,259
Karen, I know you want
to help, but you can't.

289
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,495
You wouldn't stand a
chance against her magic,

290
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,864
And I cannot help you.

291
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,233
[Breathing heavily]

292
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,635
Now, I'm going to go after
those rings like Avarice wants,

293
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:20,472
But I am not going
to give them to her.

294
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:24,911
Please let me help you, Johnny.

295
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:25,912
No.

296
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,413
It's too dangerous.

297
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,853
Not as dangerous as losing you.

298
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,668
Are you sure you're
all right about this?

299
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,503
Uh-huh.

300
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,739
And you remember
what the signal is?

301
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:56,375
Don't worry about me.

302
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:07,586
Huh!

303
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:10,990
Ah!

304
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:18,330
We're closed.

305
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,968
I'm looking for Sister Anger.

306
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:25,004
Business hours are
from 10:00 to 6:00.

307
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:27,073
I gotta talk to her.

308
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,274
You've go to listen, first.

309
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,877
I said come back tomorrow.

310
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:32,945
I'm in danger.

311
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,481
You got that right.

312
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,283
Think you want a quick lesson?

313
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,118
Greta.

314
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:39,919
That's enough.

315
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,388
Sorry, Sister.

316
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:43,189
I'm Sister Anger.

317
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,291
You wanted to meet me?

318
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:46,725
Katie.

319
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:47,593
[Sigh]

320
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:52,999
I saw your sign outside and
decided to check you out.

321
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,734
I want to learn self-defense.

322
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,837
Why?

323
00:28:57,937 --> 00:28:58,838
It's my boyfriend.

324
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:00,606
He's always hitting me.

325
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:03,142
He beats me up for no reason.

326
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,777
Like one night, I
forgot to buy beer,

327
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,446
And he smacked the
hell out of me.

328
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,115
Uh-huh.

329
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:11,884
I don't see any bruises on you.

330
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:15,087
Buck's been in jail for
the past three months.

331
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,723
Cops put them in there
last time he hit me.

332
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:20,226
And he's out now. [Sigh]

333
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:21,293
Why don't you leave him?

334
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:26,498
He's good to me sometimes.

335
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,370
I just want to
learn how to protect

336
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,373
Myself from when he goes off.

337
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:35,441
I'm sorry.

338
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,276
I don't teach that
Tai Chi nonsense here.

339
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,549
Here a woman learns
how to fight.

340
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:45,885
How to kill, if necessary.

341
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:48,220
Any man who touches
us gets hurt.

342
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:53,893
Take off your jacket.

343
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:06,538
You've got a nice body, Katie.

344
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,439
Nice and strong.

345
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,545
I could teach you
how to fight, Katie,

346
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,948
And no man will
ever hurt you again.

347
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,349
Bitch!

348
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,717
There you are.

349
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,520
Buck!

350
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,489
I made Sally tell
me where you were.

351
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:26,725
Of all the stupid things you've
done, this one sure beats all.

352
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,793
Martial arts classes?

353
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,199
Girl, you are asking for it.

354
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:34,133
Please, Buck!

355
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,501
I just thought...

356
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:36,869
Thought?

357
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:38,804
When did you start thinking?

358
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:39,738
I'm sorry!

359
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,640
Let go of me!

360
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,574
Say the word.

361
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,876
No.

362
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:46,845
You just stay out of this,
dyke, or I'll smack you too.

363
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:50,316
Let's get out of here.

364
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,118
I think I want to stay.

365
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:53,352
What'd you say?

366
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,587
I'm staying.

367
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,590
Oh, that does it, bitch.

368
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,591
[Grunting]

369
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:07,733
Are you OK?

370
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:08,534
Yeah.

371
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:12,038
Unh!

372
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:18,277
Ah!

373
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,078
No!

374
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:20,712
Stop.

375
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:21,847
Why?

376
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:24,016
He ain't worth it.

377
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,484
Prove it.

378
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:26,552
How?

379
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:27,353
Kick him.

380
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,326
[Scoffs] Come on.

381
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,127
Kick him harder.

382
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:39,131
[Chuckles] Good.

383
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,900
How'd that feel?

384
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:44,203
I need a drink.

385
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:47,206
Greta, take out the trash.

386
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:11,830
To my newest pupil.

387
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:25,744
Mm.

388
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,815
Do you really think
I'm good enough?

389
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:30,716
Oh, yeah.

390
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:31,517
I saw you kick.

391
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:32,884
It was nice and hard.

392
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:38,157
[Chuckles] It did feel good,
hurting him back like that.

393
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:41,027
I can't go home now.

394
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:43,429
I hurt him too bad.

395
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,497
I'll show you a way
to take care of him.

396
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,299
I could teach it to
you in 15 minutes.

397
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,435
It's something I usually
save for my best students.

398
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,174
Oh, what's that?

399
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:58,510
It's called the doom touch.

400
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,681
It's like a heart press,
focused and sharp.

401
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:05,051
Men actually enjoy it in the
heat of passion. [Chuckles]

402
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:06,218
They don't realize
that it's killed

403
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,887
Them until it's too late.

404
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,756
It doesn't happen right away.

405
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:14,793
It takes days,
sometimes weeks, and it

406
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,496
Looks just like a heart
attack, and no one

407
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:18,964
Ever suspects foul play.

408
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:24,836
How is that possible?

409
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,938
Mm, let's just say it's magic.

410
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,676
For three years now, I have been
teaching my students the doom

411
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:34,012
Touch, and they have been
marrying rich old men

412
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,315
And becoming rich young widows.

413
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,590
And they're always real generous
with their little old teacher.

414
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,391
You know what?

415
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:48,260
You could be one of them.

416
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,295
Me?

417
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:51,297
Yeah.

418
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:52,098
Yeah.

419
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,399
Sure you can.

420
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:55,867
[Laughs] But you've
got to learn to relax.

421
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:56,702
Trust me.

422
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:58,170
[Door closing]

423
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,576
[Breathing heavily]

424
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,484

425
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,953
[Beeping]

426
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:15,921
Come on, Karen.

427
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:35,241
What if I mess up?

428
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:38,510
You wouldn't punish me?

429
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,546
[Scoffs] Katie, of course not.

430
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:45,016
I'll take real good care of you.

431
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,017
You mean it?

432
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:47,519
I'll prove it.

433
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,561
What was that?

434
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,730
It was the cat.

435
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,531
Meow.

436
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,603
Well, looky here.

437
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,239
We got ourselves a peeper.

438
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:15,941
Now listen boys, I
don't have time for this.

439
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:19,978
So I suggest you go about your
business and leave me to mine.

440
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:23,415
He talks real
good for a pervert.

441
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,585
I like more the
way chief talks.

442
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,853
Talk to him, chief.

443
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,231
Not a good place to be.

444
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,641
Ha, No, no, no, no, no.

445
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,520
You're going to have
to learn how to relax.

446
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,761
[Grunting]

447
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:51,229
You did real good.

448
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,933
Now, throw me your
wallet, unless you think

449
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:58,370
That tin can can stop a bullet.

450
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,338
I'd just as soon find out.

451
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:07,579
Unh!

452
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:12,217
Ah!

453
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:23,929
[Groaning]

454
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,575
I'll take care of this.

455
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:11,577
[Beeping]

456
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,382
No need to get up.

457
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:21,219
You're going to sleep forever!

458
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,654
Bust his skull, Razz.

459
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:31,830
Where the hell
did you come from?

460
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,566
Go see for yourself.

461
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,735
Unh!

462
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:38,036
[Whip cracking]

463
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,007

[Whip cracking]

465
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,912
How could you, Katie?

466
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,982
Or should I call you Karen?

467
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:55,687
And after all we
meant to each other.

468
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:56,488
Who sent you?

469
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:00,325
[Whip cracking]

470
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:01,793
Who sent you?

471
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:09,400
Maybe it was your
little friend Buck?

472
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,202
Yeah.

473
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,238
Why don't you just make
this easy on yourself

474
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:16,141
And tell me who sent you?

475
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:18,610
I don't want to hurt you.

476
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,080
I really don't.

477
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,550
But a girl's gotta do...

478
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,483
[Whip cracking]

479
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:27,853
What a girl's gotta do.

480
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:30,188
Freeze, bitch!

481
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:31,723
But I'm unarmed.

482
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:32,524
See?

483
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:39,264
You can frisk me if you want.

484
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:41,299
You want to, don't you?

485
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:46,705
Run your big, strong hands
all over my little old body.

486
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:49,941
Don't come any closer.

487
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,410
Go ahead and shoot.

488
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,714
You'll never have a woman
like me outside your dreams.

489
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,553
Give me a kiss.

490
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,939
[Gasp] [choking noises]

been kissed like that before.

00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,069
Please, Karen.

500
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,672
I don't want to
hurt you anymore.

501
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:57,643
Why don't you just tell
me what I want to know?

502
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:58,744
Hm?

503
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:00,145
Why don't you tell me
what I want to know?

504
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:06,584
Because otherwise we're going
to have to start all over again.

505
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:07,385
Hm?

506
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:08,687
Give me a name.

507
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:14,425
A monk.

508
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:15,794
Who?

509
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:17,796
You heard me!

510
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:20,732
[Scoffs] A monk?

511
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:23,201
Hm, he's good.

512
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:26,037
This is going to be fun.

514
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,348
I knew you'd be back.

515
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,464
Where's Sister Anger?

516
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:28,466
Sister is taking care
of business, which means

517
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:31,636
I get to take care of you.

518
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:36,407
Sister says we shouldn't like
men, but I can't help it.

519
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,543
I love men.

520
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:41,546

squirm as I take them apart,

521
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:45,616

522
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:47,318
Listen, Greta.

523
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:48,519
You're still human.

524
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:52,157
Now, you can walk away from
here whenever you want,

525
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:54,525
But I'm going to send your
mistress back to hell,

526
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:55,994
And nobody's going to stop me.

527
00:44:56,094 --> 00:44:56,895
Stop this.

528
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:05,303

[Grunts] Please
don't hurt me anymore.

532
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:45,443
I can give pleasure
as well as pain.

533
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:48,613
You can make love
with the damned.

534
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:50,748
Ah!

536
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:53,084

00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,854
You all right?

Whatever she is is dead.

546
00:47:01,386 --> 00:47:04,890
OK. [Sigh] It's going to sting.

547

[Laughs]

548
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:06,624
I know it's going to sting.

549
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:07,558
Hold still.

550
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,328
Hold still.

00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:12,763
I know.

You're going after the other
ring tomorrow, aren't you?

554
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:23,641
Yeah, I don't have a choice.

00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:25,476
[Sigh]

556
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,178
Who is she?

557
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:32,850
[Sigh] Sister of Lust.

558
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:34,685
They say no man can
resist her, because she

559
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:36,888
Feeds off our sexual fantasies.

560
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:37,688
Ow.

561
00:47:51,937 --> 00:47:56,607
You say she feeds on lust?

562
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,944
We'll make sure you
don't have any left.

563
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:40,285
[Knocking]

564
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:47,825
[Phone ringing]

565
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,694
Sister Lust Escorts.

566
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:52,197
Hello, Senator.

567
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:53,264
Tammy.

568
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:54,232
10 o'clock?

569
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:55,033
Yes.

570
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:56,201
No problem, sir.

571
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:57,402
She'll be looking forward to it.

572
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:58,203
Goodbye.

573
00:48:58,303 --> 00:48:59,670
[Phone ringing]

574
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:03,474
Sister Lust Escorts.

575
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,977
Please hold.

576
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:06,844
May I help you, sir?

577
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,813
I'd like to see Sister Lust.

578
00:49:08,913 --> 00:49:10,881
Do you have an appointment?

579
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:12,417
With destiny.

580
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:15,186
A reference?

581
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,954
How about incognito?

582
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,623
That's a Latin reference.

583
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:21,192
It means "unknown."

584
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,427
I'm sorry, sir.

585
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:25,363
Sister sees no new clients
without a reference.

586
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:28,466
But if you'd care to wait, I
can have one of our sales agents

587
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:29,634
Out here.

588
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:31,136
That won't be necessary.

589
00:49:31,236 --> 00:49:32,570
Give the Sister my card.

590
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:33,938
I'm sure she'll want to see me.

591
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:36,074
I'll have to talk
to Tracy about this.

592
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:42,947
Desiree.

593
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:44,515
Don't you like it?

594
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:45,850
Yeah, sure.

595
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,153
It doesn't fit you.

596
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:50,421
What does?

597
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:52,690
How about something Nordic?

598
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:53,624
Erica.

599
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,060
Mm.

600
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,927
Erica.

601
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:58,596
I like that.

602
00:49:58,696 --> 00:49:59,397
It's all yours.

603
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,032
Mm, thank you.

604
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:05,936
And next time you're in here,
make sure you ask for Erica.

605
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,613
Mr. Blake?

606
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:18,449
Sister Lust will see you.

607
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:20,618
Please follow me.

608
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:22,320
Ah, wait.

609
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,989
I'm going to have to frisk
you before you go in.

610
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,891
I hope you don't mind.

611
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:30,461
As long as you don't
charge for the pleasure.

612
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:34,165
Not exactly a rent-a-cop, is he?

613
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:35,200
Much better.

614
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,235
This man puts his
soul into his work.

615
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:45,276
Sister Lust?

616
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,344
Johnny.

617
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:47,545
Welcome.

618
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,614
I've heard so much about you.

619
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:50,881
That's odd.

620
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,251
I thought I left most of
your friends speechless.

621
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:57,021
Oh, your reputation
survives them.

622
00:50:57,122 --> 00:50:58,356
Come.

623
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:00,991
Sit.

624
00:51:01,092 --> 00:51:04,061
The entertainment is
just about to begin.

625
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:07,932
Erica?

626
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,585
So you are the monk.

627
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:29,354
Hm.

628
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:32,757
Not exactly the grim
avenger I expected.

629
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:35,460
I'm off-duty.

630
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,795
No longer chasing demons?

631
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:40,965
Just purging a few of my own.

632
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:45,503
How about, oh, witches.

633
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:48,839
Can't tell them apart
from normal women anymore.

634
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,375
Are you sure?

635
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:55,313
What if one sat
right next to you

636
00:51:55,413 --> 00:52:00,718
And got ready to do unspeakable
things to your body.

637
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:05,523
Well, that might make me
see things from her side.

638
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,392
Why'd you come here, Johnny?

639
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:14,299
Well, we both have
an interest in magic.

640
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,937
It's not just black
and white, you know.

641
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:21,306
Really?

642
00:52:21,406 --> 00:52:23,241
What other kind is there?

643
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:32,283
There's red.

644
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,083
Ooh.

645
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:41,892
I hear it's a real
three ring circus.

646
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:46,231
And I could help make
you a ring master.

647
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:47,031
How?

648
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:54,839
By getting rid of your
siblings and bringing

649
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:56,541
The circus to your town.

650
00:52:56,641 --> 00:53:02,179
Johnny, with you at my side and
my sister's rings on my hand,

651
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,417
No one will stand in our way.

652
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,218
Tracy?

653
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:08,719
Why don't you join us?

654
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:24,134
[Door opening]

655
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:29,607
You.

656
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,675
What?

657
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:32,510
No romance novels on
Johnny's bookshelf?

658
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,211
What'd you do to him, bitch?

659
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:36,414
Just satisfied his
secret ambition,

660
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:39,617
A guilt-free taste of passion.

661
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:43,053
He never would've touched
you if you hadn't hexed him.

662
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:45,690
I didn't force him to enjoy it.

663
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:46,891
But he did.

664
00:53:46,991 --> 00:53:49,394
Like a kid in a candy store.

665
00:53:49,494 --> 00:53:50,461
That's a lie.

666
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:51,262
What?

667
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:53,331
You think he loves you?

668
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:55,099
Silly girl.

669
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,667
He likes strong women.

670
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:57,835
Secure women.

671
00:53:57,935 --> 00:54:01,806
Not clingy tramps like you.

672
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,574
Where's the ring?

673
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:04,909
I don't have it.

674
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:07,545
Hand it over, or those
scars you have will be

675
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:08,513
Your most attractive feature.

676
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:31,636
Naughty, naughty.

677
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:43,414
Second.

678
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:51,422
Tracy.

679
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,787
[Sigh] Talented, isn't she?

680
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:05,990
And the perfect secretary.

681
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,926
Types 90 words a minute
and brings coffee.

682
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:14,565
[Chuckles] But do you know
what her best skill is?

683
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:19,537
Male bosses can't seem to
keep their hands off of her.

684
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:24,341
The more professional she acts
the more frustrated they get.

685
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,911
But in the end, it's my
Tracy that they want.

686
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:31,849
And when they finally
cross that line,

687
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:35,419
I make them pay
a fortune for it.

688
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,355
And that's the beauty
of sexual harassment.

689
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:36,246
Johnny, if we're
to become partners,

690
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:41,752
We have to be partners in
every way, body and soul.

691
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:48,859
Mm.

692
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,795
Ah.

693
00:58:50,895 --> 00:58:52,029
What's the matter, Johnny?

694
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:53,864
Hm?

695
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:57,534
Doesn't look so good to you now?

696
00:58:57,635 --> 00:59:00,070
You don't want me anymore?

697
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:06,176
[Laughs] Well, I want you.

698
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:11,215
And I'm going to have
you for eternity.

699
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:13,150
Look into my eyes, baby.

700
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,654
See how they burn for you.

701
00:59:16,754 --> 00:59:18,122
Look deep.

702
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:19,123
Deeper.

703
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:22,126
Ah, that's right.

704
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:25,863
Now, give me your soul, Johnny.

705
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:29,033
It's a small price
to pay for my kiss.

706
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:32,002
[Moaning]

707
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:38,075
Don't fight me, sweetheart.

708
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,444
Love me.

709
00:59:40,544 --> 00:59:45,816
I can give you fantasies beyond
anything you've ever imagined.

710
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,787
I can be every woman
you've ever wanted.

711
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,328
Miss Russell!

712
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,797
Johnny.

713
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:03,433
It's been a long time, Johnny.

714
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:06,603
You were one of my best pupils.

715
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:08,338
And no wonder.

716
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:12,009
I saw the way you
looked at me in class.

717
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:12,977
How did you get...

718
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:14,945
You were so young.

719
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:18,048
But oh, so cute.

720
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:21,618
Well, we're both adults now.

721
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:22,787
JOHNNY: Miss Russell...

722
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:24,755
Sh.

723
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,691
It's all right.

724
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:29,660
You like what you see?

725
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,461
Good.

726
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:32,997
I can teach you
things the school

727
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:37,034
Board would never approve of.

728
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,003
Miss Russell, no!

729
01:00:39,103 --> 01:00:40,504
Miss Russell isn't here.

730
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:41,305
Corie?

731
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:42,840
Hi, Johnny.

732
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:43,708
JOHNNY: Where's...

733
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:45,943
My, what a pretty man you are.

734
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:52,249
Oh, yes.

735
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:53,751
You never noticed me before.

736
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:54,985
Sure I did.

737
01:01:03,027 --> 01:01:05,095
Uh, this isn't right.

738
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:06,163
Oh, don't worry.

739
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:07,564
My parents are out of town.

740
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,465
No.

741
01:01:08,565 --> 01:01:11,869
Not... not this.

742
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:14,171
Everything.

743
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:15,539
You.

744
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:18,208
Here.

745
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:19,443
You haven't aged.

746
01:01:19,543 --> 01:01:21,578
Ah, but you have.

747
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,947
[Giggles]

748
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:25,716
Stop it.

749
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:27,051
We don't have to stop.

750
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:34,424
[Kissing noises]

751
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:42,833
Karen?

752
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:44,501
You're not supposed to be here.

753
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,636
I know.

754
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:48,138
I just couldn't stay away.

755
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:53,377
Where's Sister Lust?

756
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:55,412
She's gone.

757
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:56,680
But I'm here now.

758
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:59,683
You don't need anyone else.

759
01:01:59,784 --> 01:02:00,885
Look at me, Johnny.

760
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:09,193
Other men would kill to
have me, but I'm all yours.

761
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:11,461
You seem different.

762
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,297
I am.

763
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:16,166
I'm a lot stronger now.

764
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:19,603
Your love made me this way.

765
01:02:19,703 --> 01:02:22,539
Do you like the new me?

766
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:25,475
Sure.

767
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,644
I'm going to make
you feel so good.

768
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:43,493
Take me, Johnny.

769
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:51,568
I need you, body and soul.

770
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:02,412
You're not the real Karen!

771
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:03,213
[Grunts]

772
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:04,181
[Crunch]

773
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:26,503
Karen!

774
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:31,976
Karen, I'm back!

775
01:03:36,046 --> 01:03:36,914
[Thwack]

776
01:03:56,934 --> 01:03:58,668
Well, well, well.

777
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:01,471
If it ain't the monk.

778
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:02,806
Where's Karen?

779
01:04:02,907 --> 01:04:03,974
Cathy got her.

780
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:06,343
What?

781
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:07,544
My daughter.

782
01:04:07,644 --> 01:04:10,414
Catherine's your daughter?

783
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:11,681
You're Bo Coogan.

784
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:12,482
Brilliant.

785
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:26,997
But I come for this.

786
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:27,797
Why?

787
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:33,703
To keep it away
from her and you.

788
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:34,704
You are her dog.

789
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:37,474
JOHNNY: Not by choice.

790
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:38,742
BO: The party ends
just the same.

791
01:04:38,842 --> 01:04:40,844
I've been watching.

792
01:04:40,945 --> 01:04:43,113
She sends, and you fetch.

793
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,782
And I know you killed
my two other girls.

794
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,985
They weren't human anymore.

795
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:49,186
BO: Well, you did
what I couldn't

796
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:52,389
To my own flesh and blood,
and I owe you for that.

797
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:53,890
Though I've still
got to kill you,

798
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:56,126
I just want you to
know why, first.

799
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,061
Please.

800
01:04:57,161 --> 01:04:58,262
Don't cut to the chase.

801
01:04:58,362 --> 01:05:00,464
It's because of the demon.

802
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:02,232
Asmodeus?

803
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:04,634
You raped and kidnapped
his priestess.

804
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,670
And he's been
haunting me ever since.

805
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:10,941
And he's coming for me
tonight, if the demon crosses.

806
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:12,476
Tonight?

807
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:14,211
Of course.

808
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:16,546
By midnight every seven years.

809
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:19,049
It's Walpurgis Night.

810
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:21,385
The demon's powers are tonight.

811
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:22,886
That's what she wants.

812
01:05:22,987 --> 01:05:25,122
What her momma
wanted 28 years ago.

813
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:26,790
The demon crossing.

814
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:29,793
[Laughs]

815
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:35,599
Funny, ain't it?

816
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:39,069
You're the saint
and I'm the sinner,

817
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:43,873
Yet I've saved the world
and you almost wrecked it.

818
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:48,178
[Laughs] Without
the whole hailstorm,

819
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,614
That demon can't cross,
and this rock is going

820
01:05:50,714 --> 01:05:52,482
To the bottom of the ocean.

821
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:54,018
After I take care of you.

822
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:55,619
Wait.

823
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:57,854
You still haven't told me.

824
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,089
Why me?

825
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:00,390
Why?

826
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:03,160
Because you're too good
a dog to be tracking me.

827
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:03,927
[Beeping]

828
01:06:04,028 --> 01:06:04,728
[Electric shock]

829
01:06:04,828 --> 01:06:06,430
Ah!

830
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:09,399
Ah!

I knew it would get me.

01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:36,720
Friggin' demon.

842
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:46,563
After all these years, I
forgot about the curse.

843
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:48,232
Walpurgis Night.

844
01:07:48,332 --> 01:07:50,066
The ring band must be
some sort of stop valve

845
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:52,836
Against the Hell stone's power.

846
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:54,371
I'll be damned.

847
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:56,373
Afraid so.

848
01:07:56,473 --> 01:07:58,342
[Moaning] [coughing]

849
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:00,497
You're right on time.

850
01:10:00,597 --> 01:10:02,466
I like that in a man.

851
01:10:02,566 --> 01:10:04,634
Where's Karen?

852
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:08,338
You don't mean that
silly secretary of yours?

853
01:10:08,438 --> 01:10:11,140
Is she alive?

854
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:13,577
For now.

855
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:16,079
I know what you're
thinking, Johnny.

856
01:10:16,179 --> 01:10:18,515
I look so vulnerable.

857
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:23,052
One swipe of your big
old sword and... well,

858
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:24,354
What are you waiting for?

859
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:26,923
Stop fucking with me, Avarice.

860
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:28,658
Smart boy.

861
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:29,793
OK.

862
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,060
To business.

863
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,362
Where's the ring?

864
01:10:32,462 --> 01:10:34,030
Not far.

865
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,700
[Scoffs] I'm in no
mood for games, Johnny.

866
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,303
[Scoffs] Then cut
out the hide and seek.

867
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:43,072
You tell me where Karen is,
I'll tell you where the ring is.

868
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,442
You dare bargain with me?

[Grunting]

870
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:54,017
The ring, Johnny.

871
01:10:54,117 --> 01:10:57,020
Give me the ring, and
I'll stop the pain.

872
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:03,327
What are you doing?

873
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:07,764
[Gasping] Preparing
to commit seppuku.

874
01:11:07,864 --> 01:11:10,033
You're never going
to get that ring.

[Gasp] Three...

876
01:11:11,868 --> 01:11:13,303
My ring will find it.

877
01:11:13,403 --> 01:11:15,104
Don't bet on it.

878
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:16,139

01:11:23,347 --> 01:11:26,650
Where's Karen?

884
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,217
[Scoffs] I'll take you to her.

885
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:49,072
Why do you persist in
fighting me, Johnny?

886
01:11:49,172 --> 01:11:54,478
You should know by now, I'll
fight you till my dying breath.

887
01:11:54,578 --> 01:11:55,979
You were asking about Karen?

888
01:12:00,884 --> 01:12:02,151
Johnny.

889
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:04,654
You bitch.

890
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:10,326
Why Johnny, I believe you
have your consonants confused.

891
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:11,661
Come along and join the fun.

892
01:12:24,974 --> 01:12:25,975
You've seen her.

893
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:29,012
I've held up my
end of the bargain.

894
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:31,280
Now, the ring please.

895
01:12:31,381 --> 01:12:33,049
Let her go.

896
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:35,652
Johnny, I even said please.

897
01:12:35,752 --> 01:12:36,986
Hm.

898
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:39,489
No?

899
01:12:39,589 --> 01:12:40,289
As you wish.

900
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:47,464
I'll ask again, though
not as politely.

901
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:48,432
The ring.

902
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:49,433
Go to hell.

903
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:53,403

906
01:13:15,425 --> 01:13:17,160
Gold box.

907
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:20,329
Clever boy.

908
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:22,265
No wonder my ring
couldn't locate it.

909
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:28,004
The third.

910
01:13:30,874 --> 01:13:32,876
Where's the band?

911
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:33,810
It melted.

912
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,982
Well, never mind.

913
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,084
We're losing moonlight.

914
01:13:41,184 --> 01:13:44,488
Onto the main attraction.

915
01:13:44,588 --> 01:13:46,155
Leave the sword.

916
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:50,026
Good help is hard to find
and even harder to reanimate.

917
01:14:09,312 --> 01:14:13,917
Make one wrong move and I'll
kill you where you stand.

918
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:16,820
And miss out on
seeing Asmodeus?

919
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,921
I wouldn't dream of it.

920
01:14:18,021 --> 01:14:21,024
It's not that I mistrust you.

921
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:22,892
It's just that I'm
going to be otherwise

922
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:26,195
Engaged with your girlfriend.

923
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,464
So don't go sticking
your pretty neck out.

Asmodeus, Lord of Vice,
accept my sacrifice,

927
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:52,388
That her blood shall be
your stream into our world.

928
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,423
I shall welcome
you as your slave.

929
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:55,391
[Thunder]

930
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:58,294
Worship your darkness forever.

931
01:14:58,394 --> 01:14:59,262
[Thunder]

932
01:14:59,362 --> 01:15:01,497
ASMODEUS: Pour the
blood, Avarice.

933
01:15:01,598 --> 01:15:06,169
I thirst for the
life of your wound.

934
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:08,104
Yes, Master.

935
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:10,373
I long to serve you.

936
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:11,340
No!

937
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,343
[Grunting]

938
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:19,348
Die!

939
01:15:23,419 --> 01:15:24,320
[Grunting]

940
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:29,826
Ah!

941
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:37,801
[Exhale]

942
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:44,273
[Exhale]

943
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:03,760
Unh!

944
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:04,560
Ah!

945
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:08,464
Karen, get out of here.

946
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,433
Not until you're safe.

947
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:15,905
[Grunting]

948
01:16:16,005 --> 01:16:17,874
[Thwack]

949
01:16:17,974 --> 01:16:19,876
[Thwack]

950
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:21,344
[Grunting]

951
01:16:34,858 --> 01:16:35,859
My monk.

952
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:40,163
You are more than clever.

953
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:42,098
And what a shame.

954
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:45,835
Had you stayed on my
side and done my bidding,

955
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:48,738
We would have made
quite the pair.

956
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:49,538
Uh!

957
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:55,144
[Scoffs] But I've
still got the rings.

958
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:57,981
And you've got... well, nothing.

959
01:17:00,884 --> 01:17:04,854
But when all is said and
done, your little struggle

960
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:09,625
Here will only make Asmodeus'
triumph that much sweeter.

961
01:17:26,075 --> 01:17:27,510
You'll have to
celebrate in hell!

962
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:29,012
Uh!

963
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:30,013
[Knifing]

964
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:37,687
Karen.

965
01:17:37,787 --> 01:17:40,056
Are you all right?

966
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,458
ASMODEUS: Nice work, monk.

967
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:45,995
I was getting a little tired
of Sister Avarice, weren't you?

968
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:46,796
Asmodeus.

969
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:52,235
What did you do with Karen?

970
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,037
ASMODEUS: Oh, she's still here.

971
01:17:54,137 --> 01:17:56,272
But she's all mine.

972
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:59,208
Would you like to talk to her?

973
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:02,278
Johnny, don't listen to him.

974
01:18:02,378 --> 01:18:03,947
ASMODEUS: Isn't she precious?

975
01:18:04,047 --> 01:18:07,183
Let her go.

976
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:10,353
You could still have your
world of vice if you want.

977
01:18:10,453 --> 01:18:13,256
ASMODEUS: She's my
insurance policy.

978
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:15,859
And besides, I kind
of like it in here.

979
01:18:25,935 --> 01:18:27,070
She's not a part of this.

980
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:30,907
ASMODEUS: You have quite
the dilemma, don't you?

981
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:38,447
To get rid of me would entail...
Well, to get rid of her.

982
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,850
Let her go.

983
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,285
ASMODEUS: Your darling Karen.

984
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:47,991
I'm going to have so
much fun with her.

985
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,209
[Laughs]

986
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:12,615
Well, I've got a lot of
things to enjoy in this world.

987
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:16,585
Karen.

988
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:22,591
Karen!

989
01:19:26,195 --> 01:19:28,564
ASMODEUS: [growling]

990
01:19:28,664 --> 01:19:30,566
[Gurgling]

991
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:35,071
[Moaning]

992
01:20:41,037 --> 01:20:43,439
[Sobbing]

993
01:20:49,212 --> 01:20:49,913
No!

994
01:20:55,985 --> 01:21:01,157
[Music playing]
