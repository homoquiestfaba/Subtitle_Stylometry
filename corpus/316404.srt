1
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,310
Hi. I'm zekeriya291, M.D.

2
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:14,218
I couldn't help noticing
your lovely necklace.

3
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,990
And what's your area of specialty,
Dr. Villiers?

4
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,621
I kill monkeys,

5
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,395
as well as rats, gerbils,
the occasional potbellied pig,

6
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,266
but mostly monkeys.

7
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,735
- He means medical research, dear.
- Nope.

8
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,436
I just like to kill monkeys.

9
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,477
It's late. We should be going.
Good night, Doctor.

10
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,947
- Good night.
- Yeah.

11
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,011
Go easy on him tonight!

12
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,174
What?

13
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,650
Oh, my goodness.

14
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,406
What do you want from me?

15
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,645
Somebody please help me.

16
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,485
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

17
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,288
- I'm getting worse.
- I don't have it, swear to God.

18
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,885
Don't fuck with me!

19
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,531
Please, you gotta believe me!

20
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,995
I need that buffer now, Devin.

21
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,304
It's locked in a vault.
I can't get to it, nobody can.

22
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,646
- Then make some more.
- No. No, not me.

23
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,212
Then who? Who can make the buffer?

24
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,184
Maggie! Maggie Dalton.

25
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,528
She synthesized the compound,
did the research.

26
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,756
Nobody else, just her.

27
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,264
Maggie Dalton.

28
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,970
Please, please let me go.

29
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:43,803
Don't tell anyone I was here.
You never even saw me.

30
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,503
No, no. God, no.

31
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,831
But I saw you.

32
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,252
Excuse me, there's a guy
in the bathroom, bleeding.

33
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,481
Come on.

34
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,904
Oh, shit.

35
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,423
We need paramedics in here right away.

36
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,467
How could we have let this slip by?

37
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:43,818
Hey.

38
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,191
- Sleeping on the job?
- Me? No.

39
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,234
Just deep in thought.

40
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,997
Yeah, 40 winks deep.

41
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,761
What'd you find out?

42
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,777
Well, they said he was pretty trashed,
committed some serious party fouls.

43
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,777
Assume our suspect's covered in blood.

44
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,615
How does he walk out of here unnoticed?

45
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,050
And barefoot.

46
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,188
Check it out.

47
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,064
Death by cell phone.

48
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,628
That's a first.

49
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,833
- He popped the SIM card.
- So somebody's got his address book.

50
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,740
- That can't be good.
- Nope.

51
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,015
Excuse me, we're not finished in here.

52
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,315
- My God!
- Excuse me, excuse me.

53
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,119
I'm sorry, Detective.

54
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,526
This man was one of my staff.

55
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,188
I apologize. May I?

56
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,824
I'm Dr. William Reisner,
of the Reisner Institute.

57
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,094
- Think tank over in Redmond.
- Yes.

58
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,006
And on occasion, we do more than think.

59
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:05,942
- Any thoughts on this?
- We contract to the Pentagon, Detective.

60
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,182
As I'm sure you can imagine,
we have a long list of enemies.

61
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,049
Great, well, we'd love
to get a statement from you outside.

62
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,850
- We'll be taking over from here.
- On whose authority?

63
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,552
Well, I've cleared it with your superiors,
if that's what you mean.

64
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,528
They clear you
to contaminate the crime scene, too?

65
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,667
- Are we good now?
- Yeah, perfect.

66
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,672
Let's make sure Forensics bags the hands,
I want to get a fingernail...

67
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,800
- You all heard the Colonel.
- Yeah, I heard the Colonel.

68
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,805
Let's let it go, Frank.

69
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,281
- We're rolling over on this?
- It's not me.

70
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,446
DOD's calling the shots on this one.

71
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,955
Reisner's hooked in with the Pentagon.

72
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,958
- You're letting them investigate themselves.
- Did I say I liked it?

73
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,792
Come on, this isn't
Halliburton overcharging for unleaded, Tom.

74
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,660
It's a murder case, they have no jurisdiction.

75
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,256
Read the Patriot Act.

76
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,736
- I need you to run a soft cover on this girl.
- Great.

77
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,398
- Still letting us give out tickets, right?
- Yeah.

78
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,703
She was the staff biologist
over at the Institute.

79
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,108
- Reisner's concerned about her.
- Babysitting gig.

80
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,507
Look, you're still on the case.

81
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,574
Besides, she's got, like, eight diplomas,
you might learn something.

82
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,712
- Look, Tom...
- We're done, Frank.

83
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,512
Now get out of here,

84
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,985
before my ulcer starts bleeding.

85
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,595
What, were you guys born in a barn?

86
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,410
- I guess I should've studied biology.
- Yeah, right?

87
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,709
Great.

88
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,655
Hello, Detectives.
Thank you for helping us out.

89
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,549
Come in.

90
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,919
Hey.

91
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,157
- Hackles down.
- Yeah.

92
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,436
This is Dr. Margaret Dalton.
Margaret, these are Detectives Turner and...

93
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,379
- Martinez. We'll be taking the first shift.
- Great.

94
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,911
How much danger do you think I'm in?

95
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,389
Well, we don't know too many of the details,
Miss Dalton, we're just security.

96
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,887
Well, my colleague was murdered,

97
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,932
brutally, from what I've been able
to piece together.

98
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:46,267
And honestly, I expected someone
more senior, more in the loop.

99
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:51,337
The chief assures me
they're two of the finest on the force.

100
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,068
You'll be fine, ma'am.

101
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:56,410
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm sure you're entirely competent.

102
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,679
Thanks.
Do you mind if we secure the premises?

103
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,810
Go ahead.

104
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,023
Good night, William.

105
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,150
I'll check back in the morning.

106
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:22,641
Well, I'll be upstairs.
Make yourselves comfortable.

107
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,242
- Sorry, I was just gonna...
- I've gotta get that fixed.

108
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,409
I got a 1920s bungalow.
Does the same thing.

109
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,476
Creaks and groans like a ghost.

110
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,422
- You check downstairs, I'll take up.
- I'm sure you will.

111
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,899
- Okay, you take upstairs, I'll take down.
- No, no, go ahead, I'm fine.

112
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,027
- You sure?
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

113
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,970
I like it down here
with the creaks and the groans.

114
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,808
- You have any firearms in the house?
- No.

115
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,941
Anyone else regularly use your place?
Friends, relatives?

116
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,143
Nope.

117
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,752
You don't have a housekeeper? Boyfriend?

118
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,282
I have a cat.

119
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,490
I'm a dog person, myself. This your office?

120
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,851
Yeah.

121
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,659
Mostly just some personal stuff.

122
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,259
- Do you mind?
- No, no, not at all.

123
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,446
Rainfall noise works for me.

124
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,043
I need to check in there.

125
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,880
I guess if you've got
any voyeuristic tendencies,

126
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:44,980
this is a great job, huh?

127
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,890
Don't worry,
we take pills for that sort of thing.

128
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,559
My kid sister, Heather.
She's a freshman at U-Dub.

129
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,636
Must be close.

130
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,301
Or I'm overcompensating.

131
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,979
We're done up here.

132
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,565
What were you and Dr. Villiers working on?

133
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,645
Do you discuss your cases with strangers?

134
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,538
I'm still bound
by a non-disclosure agreement.

135
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,677
- I couldn't tell you if I wanted to.
- What do you mean "still"?

136
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,813
Well, I haven't worked there for six months.
I was let go.

137
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,357
What do you do now?

138
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,222
I'm unemployed.

139
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,823
Quite an overhead you got.

140
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,063
William Reisner
was an extremely gracious employer.

141
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,831
- All secure downstairs, Frank.
- Great.

142
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,370
Here's my cell phone number.
Put it on speed dial.

143
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,598
We'll be right outside if you need us.

144
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,938
One of us could stay inside
if you'd feel more comfortable.

145
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,205
I'll be fine.

146
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,513
I'd like to keep that door unlocked,
in case we need to get to you quickly.

147
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,948
Is that standard?

148
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,712
Well, it's a good idea.

149
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,014
Okay, then.

150
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,677
Okay, anyone with eight degrees
has no right to look like that.

151
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,972
Like what?

152
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,276
Oh, yeah, act like you didn't notice.

153
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,444
She could probably melt concrete
with those blue eyes.

154
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,248
They were green, actually.

155
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,351
- Bell Ranger.
- Not one of ours.

156
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,218
It's heading north.
I'll call it in anyway. N-7953?

157
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,291
Lewis, it's Turner.
Get me an ID through Sea-Tac ATC.

158
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,202
Non-police Bell Ranger, tail number N-7-9

159
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,637
- 5-3.
...5- 3.

160
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,299
<i>- 7-9-5-3. Got it.</i>
- Okay.

161
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,610
- Have fun.
- Okay.

162
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,815
Hey, Frank.

163
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,619
<i>Keep it down in there,</i>
<i>you're gonna disturb the neighbors.</i>

164
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:37,317
<i>I'm sure they got better things to do</i>
<i>than listen to me hum.</i>

165
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,298
You promise? I mean, really, really promise?

166
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:46,361
- Don't worry.
- I swear, if you Paris me, I'm dead.

167
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,099
My dad will kill me.

168
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:52,441
- I mean it.
- Come on. You know I'd never do that.

169
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,642
What if my parents come home early?

170
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,982
My dad sometimes drives around the block
just to trick me.

171
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,316
I'll go check.

172
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,194
It's all good.

173
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,691
Close the blinds, okay?

174
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,361
All right.

175
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,407
Now, play with yourself a little,
have some fun.

176
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,966
- You sound like a porn director.
- You wish.

177
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:06,978
Nice.

178
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,892
<i>Hey, Frank, look in the mirror.</i>

179
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,857
Your Arizona tan is officially gone.

180
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,456
<i>You're one of us now.</i>

181
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,800
Great, how'd that happen?

182
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,402
I like it. It suits you.

183
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,268
Oh, thanks.

184
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,943
Shit.

185
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,252
That's it.

186
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,624
Come on, a little more.

187
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,101
Nice.

188
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,343
- That's it.
- Okay, your turn.

189
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,009
<i>What've we got here?</i>

190
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,252
Must be the sister, Heather.

191
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,921
Hey. It's Heather, right?

192
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,890
You look like a cop.

193
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,197
What makes you say that?

194
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,596
Your suit.

195
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,865
Nobody would actually wear that.

196
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,337
I'm Detective Martinez.

197
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,673
She's dead, isn't she?

198
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,548
At her computer,
suffocated under a pile of printouts.

199
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,745
Nobody found the body for days,

200
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,789
and now there's some
creepy bio-culture growing out of her nose.

201
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,620
No, no, she's fine.

202
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,526
Everything's fine.

203
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,994
Means everything's not fine.

204
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,566
Oh, yeah, she's a peach.

205
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,837
Okay, I think I got it. Okay.

206
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,808
Wait, just a sec.

207
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,579
What are you doing?

208
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,490
- I thought I saw someone.
- What?

209
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,827
Ash, come on.

210
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,920
There's nobody here.

211
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,127
Let's play.

212
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,430
What the hell is wrong with you?

213
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,639
Someone's here.

214
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,305
Ashley, there's nobody here. Nobody.

215
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:56,977
Maggie!

216
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:58,917
Oh, shit!

217
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,199
Oh, Heather, I'm so sorry.
Something came up at the last minute.

218
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,760
Yeah, I figured as much from the stakeout.

219
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,032
It's just a precaution.

220
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,308
Against unauthorized quality time
with your sister?

221
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,078
It's a work thing.

222
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,614
That non-disclosure shit
does not apply to me.

223
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,673
There's nothing to worry about.

224
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,652
- Go to the concert, take Chelsea...
- I already did.

225
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,414
It's over.

226
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,151
Listen, Heather, I'm really sorry.

227
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,562
This is just a crazy time right now,
but it will be over soon, I promise.

228
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,688
Right.

229
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,688
Well, in the meantime,

230
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,567
I'm gonna go shoot crystal and get pregnant
by some guy I barely know.

231
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,507
No, you're not. Heather.

232
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:53,135
And it wasn't a concert,
it was a poetry slam.

233
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,752
Everything okay?

234
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,748
Okay.

235
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,718
Good night.

236
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,522
Could you...

237
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,026
Could you just make sure she's okay?

238
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:16,927
You bet.

239
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,458
Thanks.

240
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:05,810
Hi, kitty.

241
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,812
You want in? Yeah? Come on.

242
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,451
Come on, kitty.

243
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:12,681
Come on.

244
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,322
Come on.

245
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,057
Come on.

246
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,740
There you go.

247
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,161
- Turner.
<i>- I think I heard something.</i>

248
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,667
Lisa just went inside, it's probably her.

249
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,364
<i>Stay inside your study</i>
<i>until you hear from us.</i>

250
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,111
Lisa, how's everything going in there?

251
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,150
It all looks fine.
I'm just gonna check upstairs.

252
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,880
Okay. Maggie's in her study,
make sure she knows everything's okay.

253
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,723
Who's there?

254
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,560
It's Detective Martinez, ma'am.
Stay in the room.

255
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:03,592
<i>Lisa?</i>

256
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,695
<i>Lisa.</i>

257
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,478
Shit.

258
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,000
Lisa!

259
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,342
Shit.

260
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,881
Come on, baby.
Come on, stay with me. Come on.

261
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:00,982
Damn it.

262
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,122
Oh, Jesus.

263
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:05,821
Come on.

264
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,126
- Stay inside.
- Does she have a pulse?

265
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,797
- No.
- I'll do chest compressions. Breathe.

266
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,605
- And one, and two, and three, and four...
- Come on, Lisa, breathe. Breathe.

267
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,205
And one, and two, and three,
and four, and five.

268
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,884
- Breathe, damn it!
- Take over!

269
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,420
One, two, three, four, five.

270
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,021
Come on.

271
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,029
Come on. Come on.

272
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,569
- Detective.
- What?

273
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,730
Her pupils are fixed and dilated.

274
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,872
I'm sorry, there's no use.

275
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,052
<i>- All units, all units in position.</i>
- Move, move, move!

276
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,082
<i>Second team. Move into Bronco position.</i>

277
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,781
<i>- Take around back.</i>
<i>- Roger that.</i>

278
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,017
<i>Okay, watch your screens,</i>
<i>watch your screens.</i>

279
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,217
Secure the perimeter!

280
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,920
Watch the windows.

281
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,054
Turner!

282
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,519
Help!

283
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,061
<i>Zulu Two, are we clear?</i>

284
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,826
Maggie?

285
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:20,698
- Maggie!
- Where is it?

286
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,034
- I don't know.
- I know you have it.

287
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,631
It's not here, but...

288
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,307
<i>We got movement upstairs.</i>
<i>All units move into position.</i>

289
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,777
<i>Keep your eyes on the screen!</i>

290
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,781
Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?

291
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,249
I heard you talking to him. Where is he?

292
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,618
Get out of my way!

293
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,383
<i>Get upstairs.</i>

294
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,891
- Clear out the room, now! Move!
- Go!

295
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,568
They're firing upstairs!

296
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,192
<i>Negative.</i>

297
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:55,129
<i>Report, report!</i>

298
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,003
<i>Negative. Asserting perimeter.</i>

299
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,307
<i>Civilians clearing through, hold fire.</i>

300
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,543
- Did we get him?
- Still waiting on confirmation.

301
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,310
- Rollins!
<i>- Had him, Colonel Bishop.</i>

302
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,351
<i>- He was right here in front of us.</i>
- Bishop, what's happening?

303
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,011
<i>- We'll get him.</i>
<i>- I got nothing on my screen.</i>

304
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,111
<i>- Do you see?</i>
<i>- I can't see him!</i>

305
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,177
William?

306
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:14,257
This whole thing was a goddamn setup.
You used her as bait.

307
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:17,385
Our tactics were necessary. I'm sorry.
Now clear out and let us do our job.

308
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,192
I lost my partner in there,
you son of a bitch!

309
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,823
Get out of here, now!

310
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,759
<i>Repeat fire.</i>

311
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,201
Grenade, grenade!

312
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,405
What the hell's going on?

313
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,343
<i>I can't see a goddamn thing!</i>

314
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,607
<i>Sweep downstairs.</i>

315
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:40,946
<i>I got him, I got him!</i>

316
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,281
<i>Target! Take him out!</i>

317
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,131
Go, go!

318
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:11,771
Come on.

319
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,208
Go, go!

320
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,120
Fuck!

321
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,664
Plummer! Watkins! We've lost containment.

322
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,229
Get those Sky-Eyes off the dime.

323
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,795
- Rollins! What the hell happened?
- We lost the subject, sir.

324
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,266
All units, fall back!

325
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,546
Okay, come on. Go, go!

326
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,168
What the hell was that thing?

327
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,295
What kind of biologist are you?

328
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,274
My partner is dead.

329
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:14,607
He wanted you. Not Lisa, you.
I want answers.

330
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,239
Look, I don't know.

331
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,711
I'm trying to understand this myself.
It doesn't make any sense.

332
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,159
All right.

333
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,393
We'll go to the station and regroup.

334
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,461
No, you can't take me to the police,
you're a cop.

335
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,269
- He'll know I'm there.
- You don't have a choice.

336
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:46,667
- Let go!
- Turner.

337
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:47,836
<i>Yeah, hey, dude, it's Lewis.</i>

338
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,641
<i>- About your Bell Ranger...</i>
- I'm not going to the cops!

339
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,739
<i>That tail number doesn't show up</i>
<i>in any of our databases.</i>

340
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,408
<i>Maybe you should go get</i>
<i>your eyes checked, dude.</i>

341
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,473
No shit.

342
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,220
Bacon is murder.
That's right, people, bacon is murder.

343
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,285
That's right! Breakfast kills.
Bacon is murder.

344
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,793
Run!

345
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,036
Excuse me!

346
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,972
Keep going!

347
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,963
This way! This way! This way!
Come on. Come on.

348
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,979
I'm okay. Come on!

349
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,582
Come on.

350
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,533
Oh, shit.

351
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,901
Oh, God.

352
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,295
Oh, God.

353
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,571
Oh, God.

354
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,517
Good Christ.

355
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,492
Yeah, he just walked in.
Listen, I gotta call you back.

356
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,104
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

357
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:44,271
We're all pretty shaken up around here.
She was a good cop, Frank.

358
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:47,582
Well, she was a little more than that.

359
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:51,019
Dr. Dalton, can I get you anything?
Some water, coffee?

360
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,991
I need a laptop, a secure landline,
and some privacy would be helpful.

361
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:01,058
- Can I talk to you outside for a second?
- Yeah. Excuse us.

362
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,439
These guys are fucking with us,
they know who did this.

363
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,409
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

364
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,241
Well, give the command, we'll go after him.

365
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,508
I got 100 cops that wanna hit the streets,

366
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,174
and run that shitbag down.

367
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,684
But my orders are to hold them back,
and that means you, too.

368
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,879
What orders? Whose orders, theirs?

369
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,921
I know all about taking bad orders, Tom.

370
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,856
Well, keep your personal beefs
out of this, Frank.

371
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,325
I'm not asking you to plant evidence.

372
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,259
When did you start bending over
for the big boys?

373
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,764
- I don't even recognize you anymore.
- You did what you could.

374
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,699
- Now I need you to walk away.
- Walk away from what?

375
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,860
Walk away from what?

376
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,743
- You know what's out there, don't you?
- I know enough to leave it alone.

377
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:51,978
Look, we hold her till the Feds get here,
we transfer custody, and we're home free.

378
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,006
Yeah.

379
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,817
Another case cleared, right?

380
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,463
- We're moving you to a holding cell.
- I'm sorry?

381
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,633
Just till the Feds get here.

382
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,130
The Feds?

383
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,467
It's for your own safety.

384
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,481
All right, guys, she's all yours.

385
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,021
This way.

386
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,526
You might wanna use the restroom
before you go in there.

387
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:22,664
Those holding cell toilets
can get pretty nasty, right?

388
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,973
- It's over there. You want me to take her?
- Sure.

389
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,818
Keep walking. You heard me, go.

390
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,918
Now! Fast. Second floor.

391
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,818
We'll be right outside, don't try anything.

392
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,410
Is that right?

393
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,285
- Hey, Chesley?
- Yeah?

394
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,457
You mind watching the head?
I gotta run back upstairs.

395
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,829
- You go on, then. We'll take it from here.
- Thanks.

396
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,695
This way, this way. Come on.

397
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:46,781
- Why are you helping me?
- I wanna know why Lisa died. Now.

398
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,637
What are you doing?

399
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:09,998
Frank!

400
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,506
Tell me everything you know,
or we're going back.

401
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,947
- I can't go back there!
- But I can.

402
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,747
It's your call.

403
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,422
Okay, okay! Okay.

404
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,063
Here, put that on.

405
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,565
- What's happening?
- Get out.

406
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:49,410
<i>Look, he's just a cop, for Christ's sake.</i>
<i>Get me a fix on him now.</i>

407
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,243
We've got a 90-degree swing
around the lake.

408
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:52,907
There's no bridge, until here.

409
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,883
Which would put them
in this general vicinity.

410
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,614
If Turner gets Dalton to talk, it's over.

411
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,487
- For all of us.
- He won't, that's a promise.

412
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:04,050
<i>Seattle patrol unit has found a Mustang</i>
<i>abandoned near Union Bay.</i>

413
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,894
Put Turner out over the Net,
and get his picture to the local TV stations.

414
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:08,989
Yes, sir.

415
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,935
How does someone like that
just slip out of our hands?

416
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,904
You've really outdone yourselves this time.

417
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,669
Usually when you people make a mess,
at least you can see it.

418
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:19,800
Thanks.

419
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,577
Get down!

420
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:35,348
<i>We need assistance setting up a roadblock</i>
<i>at the 5th Street Bridge.</i>

421
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,121
<i>Unit 23, please respond.</i>

422
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,458
Okay. Come on. Get in, get in.

423
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,469
- What are we doing?
- We gotta keep moving.

424
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,138
If we stay in one place,
the cops will catch us.

425
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,703
This is some rescue.

426
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:01,317
I'm not doing this for you.
I need information.

427
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,123
Okay, start talking.

428
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:25,200
Five years ago,
a team of molecular biologists

429
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,574
broke the code for human invisibility.

430
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,338
But the program was scrapped,
almost overnight.

431
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,438
Why?

432
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:34,006
All but two of the first team were killed.

433
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,109
Something went seriously wrong.

434
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:41,582
A year later, Reisner started up again
with covert funding from the DOD.

435
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:45,117
The operation was codenamed
Silent Knight, with a "K."

436
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,253
Cute.

437
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:51,630
The idea was to create
the ultimate national security weapon,

438
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,363
an undetectable soldier.

439
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,831
Reisner managed to reproduce
the original test results.

440
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,536
Then he called me in to correct the defects.

441
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:03,914
There's a flaw in the invisibility code.

442
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,917
The serum turns human tissue invisible,
but it also has horrible side effects.

443
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:11,648
Simply put, the serum allows
light to pass directly through us...

444
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,986
- I was there, I believe you.
- Okay, but the radiation...

445
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,993
- Just tell me about the guy.
- It damages your cells.

446
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,086
- Over time, it kills them.
- Skip the science lecture.

447
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,688
Just tell me about him, and make it simple.

448
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,189
Okay.

449
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,703
Dying test subjects, not good.

450
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:32,702
So I developed a compound
called "the buffer," to keep him alive.

451
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,778
His name was Michael Griffin.

452
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:40,877
He was Special Forces.
He'd been in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq.

453
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,819
How do you feel?

454
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,750
I feel like I'm about to blast off. I feel ready.

455
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:58,833
Thanks, Doc, for this opportunity.

456
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,065
What's your name?

457
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,604
Dr. Dalton. Maggie.

458
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:08,538
Maggie.

459
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,509
Take good care of me, Maggie.

460
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,919
- How's he doing?
- Blood pressure normal, heart rate normal.

461
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,357
Galvanic skin response shows low stress.

462
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:24,917
He's smiling.

463
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,557
Let's do this.

464
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,558
Reisner told me our test went well.

465
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,526
But when they gave him the buffer
a few days later, he suddenly died.

466
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,860
Somehow the buffer had failed.

467
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,894
<i>Of course, I blamed myself.</i>

468
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,404
<i>I couldn't see the truth.</i>

469
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:45,571
Reisner let me go, but I couldn't let go.

470
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,004
I had to know why the buffer failed.

471
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:54,017
And tonight I found out.

472
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,620
The buffer didn't fail.

473
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,714
They never gave it to him.

474
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,828
It was all about making the world
a safer place.

475
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:09,896
Yeah. Nice job.

476
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:25,409
<i>Tell Command there are checkpoints</i>
<i>at every bridge and road out of the city.</i>

477
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:28,974
<i>If Turner and Dalton</i>
<i>try to leave Seattle tonight, we'll catch them.</i>

478
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,918
It's not just the cop we have to worry about,
you realize that.

479
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,925
You've got an invisible assassin out there
fighting his own war.

480
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:38,120
- And I'll bring him in.
- You've lost control of him.

481
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,755
Griffin's always operated
on the edge of anarchy.

482
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,493
When he goes into combat, he goes deep,
he goes black.

483
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,398
So why the hell would he listen to you?

484
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,903
He's still a soldier, and I'm still his CO.

485
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,201
Griffin cannot get the buffer.

486
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,869
It's that simple.

487
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,704
Now you find him, and end it.

488
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,339
Like I said, he won't get to Dalton.

489
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:02,609
Nothing happens to her.
Nothing that involves me.

490
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,555
- Are we clear?
- We are.

491
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,057
Wait here.

492
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:59,167
<i>You have nine new messages.</i>
<i>To listen to your...</i>

493
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,505
<i>Jesus, I saw it on TV. Where are you?</i>

494
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:17,054
Does the ferry to Edmonds
still run at this hour?

495
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:20,753
I don't know.

496
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,737
Hope you like canned tuna.

497
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,853
- Bishop here.
- Dalton's cell just went hot.

498
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,583
How long till you get a fix?

499
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:49,057
We're triangulating now, sir,
should be less than a minute.

500
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,559
<i>I'll be right here.</i>

501
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,630
Okay, so finish telling me
about this Michael Griffin guy.

502
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:59,135
- What else do you know about him?
- Nothing, I only met him a couple of times.

503
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:02,968
Well, the guy's a soldier.
He's held in high regard, you knew that.

504
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,166
Yeah.

505
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,742
So they spent years training him,
millions on the program,

506
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,107
why are they trying to kill him?

507
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,009
I have no idea, Turner.

508
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,809
You know, you're really on the ball, Maggie.

509
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:13,645
I'm surprised you weren't running the place.

510
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,207
I was in research.

511
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,276
The Department of Killing
must've been down the hall.

512
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,083
Come on, you telling me
the whole time you were there,

513
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:20,248
you didn't ask one single question?

514
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,349
Look, I was doing something
bigger than myself.

515
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,155
I was working for national security.

516
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:27,685
Well, how patriotic of you.
I feel so much more secure.

517
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,336
So what now, genius?

518
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,335
Take a left up there, get on the interstate.

519
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,969
In two hours we'll be in Oregon.
He'll never find us.

520
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:44,741
That's your big plan,
play hide and seek with the invisible guy?

521
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,283
Without the buffer,
the serum's attacking his organs.

522
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,716
He can't live for more than a month.

523
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:50,810
We're not going anywhere.
That bastard killed my partner.

524
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,219
I'm not turning my back on that.

525
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,089
She was trying to protect you.

526
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:00,195
She might still be alive
if you'd told the truth.

527
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,739
I got a message. A couple of minutes ago.

528
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,006
Great.

529
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:21,240
You just turned yourself
into a tracking beacon.

530
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,752
I was just trying to call my sister,
let her know that I'm okay.

531
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,651
Who sent the message?

532
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:29,516
Look, this guy's been texting me
for months,

533
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:31,288
ever since I started working for Reisner.

534
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,829
Little warnings. Nothing specific.

535
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,356
But he stopped, till now.

536
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:39,766
Whoever it is must've known
about the attack on your house.

537
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,633
Must be tracking you.

538
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:47,670
- Where are we going?
- 2058 Ludlow. Meet your pen pal.

539
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:50,335
How do we know
he's not one of the bad guys?

540
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,506
We don't.

541
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,592
A lot of people hate working nights, huh?

542
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,796
Me, I don't mind it at all.

543
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:18,941
It's quiet. You can hear yourself think.

544
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,235
You know what I mean?

545
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,336
Oh, I know what you mean.

546
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:26,445
I hate this place more than you could know.

547
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:30,850
Well, it's not for everybody, that's for sure.

548
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:32,978
No, it isn't.

549
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:35,488
That's me.

550
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,230
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

551
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,022
You know where I could find
Colonel Bishop?

552
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,963
- It's the last door on your left.
- Thank you.

553
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,503
You have a nice voice.
That's North Carolina, right?

554
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,071
Hello?

555
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:59,510
Cherry Point, ma'am.

556
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,748
Cherry...

557
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:10,220
Then back trace her number.
I want to know who made that last call.

558
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:14,389
Call me when you get a hit.

559
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:23,465
Yeah, I checked it out, man.

560
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,441
You got a few winos on the nod,
maybe a couple homeless, that's it.

561
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:30,241
- That's it? Hey, hey, you sure?
- Yeah, Scout's honor, man.

562
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:33,580
All right. Here.

563
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,843
Anytime, Officer. I love this undercover shit.

564
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,717
Oh, wait.

565
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:41,523
You know, you might wanna use
the back entrance.

566
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:43,115
It smells better.

567
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,226
<i>- Bishop.</i>
- We pulled the message, sir.

568
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:55,999
- Who sent it?
<i>- Caller's ID was scrambled,</i>

569
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,403
it's being decrypted as we speak.

570
00:52:57,474 --> 00:53:02,036
But I have the text right here,
it should be coming up on your screen.

571
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,215
What time was it sent?

572
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:10,315
Agent Moore, hello? You there?

573
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:19,191
Michael? Is that you?

574
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:35,643
Hey, I really am sorry about all this.

575
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:54,820
Well, for a second there
I thought I was actually forgiven.

576
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:01,395
I know you're tracking her,
tell me where she is.

577
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,963
You don't need Maggie Dalton.
I can get you the buffer.

578
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:08,334
But you've gotta come back in.
You've gone too far.

579
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:11,208
- Now why would I trust a traitor?
- What?

580
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:14,881
You set me up. You let them destroy me.

581
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,215
Well, you can't be that naive, Michael.

582
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:20,051
We needed a fail-safe
to protect the integrity of the program.

583
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,249
Liar!

584
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:28,187
I saved you. After what you did in Iraq.

585
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,166
You saved me to be a goddamn guinea pig.

586
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,399
If it wasn't for this project,

587
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,405
you'd have been court-martialed
for war crimes

588
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,031
and boxed off to Leavenworth!

589
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:52,415
A pen? You stab me with a goddamn pen?

590
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:54,954
Well, you better hurry up.

591
00:54:56,726 --> 00:55:00,093
I'm coming to get you.
I'm coming to get you, Bishop.

592
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,953
You're a dead man!

593
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,125
Let's see what kind of soldier you are.

594
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,134
Load that gun, soldier!

595
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,215
You lost it. Lost sight of the enemy.

596
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,825
I see the enemy clearer than ever.

597
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:07,026
They're everywhere.
Sometimes right in front of you.

598
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:12,429
Don't you understand?
I can go anywhere, see anything, anyone.

599
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,766
I'm with people
when they think they're alone.

600
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,705
- Michael.
- I see what they do,

601
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:22,541
I know what they're thinking. It disgusts me.

602
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,905
They don't deserve to live.

603
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:28,575
I need to finish our mission, Gavin,

604
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:31,785
and you're not gonna stop me.

605
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,324
Ludlow.

606
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,731
Here I come, Maggie.

607
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,898
Thanks for the tip, Colonel.

608
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:08,646
This is a bad idea.

609
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,315
Let's keep going.

610
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,116
Wait.

611
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,868
Hello? Excuse me, Colonel Bishop, I just...

612
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:17,675
You got my message.

613
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:20,222
No light. No light.

614
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,423
Oh, my God.

615
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,425
Oh, wish you hadn't done that.

616
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,229
Who are you?

617
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,730
Timothy Laurents.

618
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,839
But that's just a name.

619
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:42,337
Long since erased, Dr. Dalton.

620
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,582
- Put your hands where I can see them.
- I'm harmless.

621
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,985
I have three rare cancers,

622
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:59,125
any number of failing organs,
and a total intolerance to light.

623
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:04,023
Every day, I'm just a little more dead,

624
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,426
and a little more visible.

625
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:11,071
Of course.

626
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:13,503
There were others.

627
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,070
There were three, actually.

628
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:19,872
Number one lasted eight days.

629
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:24,448
I'm number two. And number three, well,

630
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:29,058
I believe you've already met.

631
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:40,029
- What is it?
- It's Colonel Bishop, sir.

632
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:46,735
Jesus.

633
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:50,040
Griffin.

634
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,804
The serum vault.

635
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:55,476
- The vault's secure, sir.
- Good.

636
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,045
- Clean this up.
- But, sir, I...

637
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,146
I've got the chairman
of the House Science Committee

638
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,054
coming here tomorrow.

639
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:03,858
Clean it up.

640
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,743
Operation Silent Knight

641
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:27,249
was never about national security.

642
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:30,848
It was only about political security.

643
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,187
Here. Senator Paul Hayes.

644
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:39,087
Died of acute asthmatic asphyxiation
on April 21.

645
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:43,493
His inhaler untouched at his bedside.

646
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,492
Wyatt Jennings.

647
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:51,704
Ninth Circuit judge,
broke his neck falling down a staircase,

648
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:55,304
surrounded by witnesses, April 27.

649
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,544
Clumsy feet.

650
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,847
- Is that...
- Warren Eschenburg.

651
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:06,213
Retired CIA operations chief.

652
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:10,120
Fell off his fishing boat and drowned.

653
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:12,289
May 3.

654
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:14,953
He's killing their political enemies.

655
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,189
But then why all of them?

656
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:21,501
Well, then the victims
become more randomized.

657
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:24,664
They're just regular people.

658
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:27,435
A soccer mom, a truck driver,

659
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,545
an investment banker, a detective.

660
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,808
All clustered in the Northwest,
in the last two weeks.

661
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:41,749
- He's trying to cover up his true agenda.
- I think that is his true agenda.

662
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,322
We have to end this.

663
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:48,358
- Where's the fire escape?
- Over there. South wall.

664
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,955
Go ahead. Go.

665
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:56,269
Go ahead. It's right over there.

666
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,102
I got it, I got it. Okay, go, go.

667
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,114
- Come on.
- Go, go.

668
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,329
I like you, Turner.

669
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:03,201
In your own little nine-to-five way,
you are a true warrior.

670
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:07,967
Just let it happen, buddy.

671
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:22,750
Fuck me.

672
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:25,726
It hurts to look in the mirror, doesn't it?

673
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,348
Get in.

674
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,989
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

675
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,965
And Laurents?

676
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,716
I don't know what to do.

677
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,450
I've hit a wall. How do we stop him?

678
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,560
I don't know. You're the cop.

679
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:28,375
God.

680
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,324
We gotta keep moving.

681
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:06,085
What are we doing?

682
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:08,521
I'm gonna take you to the station,
put you on a bus.

683
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,786
Head someplace you've never been,
lay low for a few months.

684
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:11,884
You should be okay.

685
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,292
You're not coming.

686
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:16,024
You've given me all the information I need.
I can handle the rest from here.

687
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:19,261
- You're still gonna go after Griffin?
- I have no choice.

688
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,161
How are you gonna find him?

689
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:25,338
I haven't quite figured that part out yet.

690
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:30,178
- You know how to use one of these?
- Yeah-ish.

691
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:34,177
- How are you gonna protect yourself?
- I don't know.

692
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,549
People say I have a nice smile,
maybe that'll help.

693
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,353
I can get another gun, Maggie.

694
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:45,155
I wanna go to 24th and Main.
I have a contact at <i>The Times.</i>

695
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,225
What, you think a bunch of nerds
with typewriters

696
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:50,424
are gonna protect you from Griffin?

697
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:51,659
I'm not looking for protection.

698
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,463
- What are you looking for?
- To finish this.

699
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:56,300
We get the word out,
it'll stop Reisner from coming after us,

700
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:59,205
and Griffin will be the last of his kind.

701
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:03,507
Once you go public,
Griffin's gonna be coming right at you.

702
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,807
I know.

703
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,015
Why would you do that?

704
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,543
Because I have no choice.

705
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:24,362
You know, you keep this up,
I might change my mind about you.

706
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:27,231
Don't bother.
I still think you're a big dumb cop.

707
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,303
- But you do have a nice smile.
- Thanks.

708
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,773
I just wanna call my sister
and tell her I'm okay.

709
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:36,503
Sure.

710
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:52,825

Shut up! Shut up!

717
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:19,445
Okay, I got a signal.

718
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:21,615
Twenty seconds, then you pull the battery,
got it?

719
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:22,748
Go.

720
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,454
Heather. Heather?

721
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:29,496
Who is this?

722
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:43,976
It was Griffin. He wants to meet.

723
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,474
I save his life or I lose my sister.

724
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,044
I'm coming with you. Let's go.

725
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:52,417
No, no. He said,
anyone shows up but me, Heather dies.

726
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:54,422
You think he's gonna let you go,
the both of you?

727
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:55,684
I don't know, but I have to try.

728
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:58,056
We have to try. Where do you get the buffer?

729
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,027
I have to make it myself.

730
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:03,464
U-Dub has a decent lab. I can get in there.

731
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:05,590
Where does he wanna meet?

732
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:08,666
Maggie, you can't do it alone.

733
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:10,371
Where does he wanna meet?

734
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:13,897
He just said to be
at the King County Terminal at 7:00.

735
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,210

751
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:23,829
Go.

752
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:32,508
Got you.

753
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:39,152
Heather, go. Go!

Hello.

757
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:57,537
The light burns. It's worse than ever.

758
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,833
Do everything I say,
or I'm gonna walk out of here

759
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:04,242
and kill your sister right now.

760
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,775
- Take off your clothes.
- What?

761
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:08,780
- Why?
- Oh, please, just do it!

762
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:10,978
- Michael, let's just go. I can make...
- Now!

763
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,460
We've got a visual on the subject.

764
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,398
Now for the last time, strip.

765
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:29,902
That's it.

766
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:34,902
You know, I've always liked you, Doc.

767
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:42,644
<i>Don't let him out of your sight.</i>
<i>That's our guy.</i>

768
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:46,454
Excuse me, you know what time it is?

769
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:47,716
My name's Detective Frank Turner.

770
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:48,882
- I'm here with your sister.
- No...

771
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:49,981
I need to know where she is.

772
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:51,389
- Just stay away from me.
- Listen to me.

773
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,722
Everything's going to be okay.
I'm here to help.

774
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:54,319
- No, I'll scream.
- Heather.

775
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:58,999
Do not let Seattle PD
take Turner into custody,

776
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,534
do you understand me?

777
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,934
Listen, you do whatever it takes.

778
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:04,666
I'm almost there.

779
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:08,309
Shirt, pants, underwear,
the whole enchilada.

780
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:12,976
Is everything okay?

781
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:16,111
Perfect.

782
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,947
Perfect, thanks.

783
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:22,790
Good. That's what we like to hear.

784
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:25,056
Well done.

785
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:26,893
Keep going.

786
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:32,962
Now tell me where they are. Please.

787
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,531
In the store? In the store?

788
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:39,305
Wait here.

789
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:42,407
We got a runner. I need backup.

790
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,707
Maggie?

791
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,175
Time's up, Maggie.

792
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,611
We're walking out of here together.

793
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,944
Now you get a taste of your own medicine.

794
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:57,190
No, no, girl, don't scream.

795
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,884
Fuck you! I told you to come alone!

796
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:01,822
Pain in the ass!

797
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:07,627
Run!

798
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,336
Heather, run, run!

799
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:19,705
No!

800
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:21,443
Let go.

801
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:23,779
Heather!

802
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:30,182
Put the gun down.

803
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:31,453
Oh! Oh my God!

804
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:36,396
Wait, wait, wait, don't shoot. Don't shoot.

805
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:38,831
You don't understand. I'm a cop.

806
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:43,061
Help me! Somebody!

807
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:45,071
No! Help me!

808
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,734
Inside. Let's go! Come on, move, move!

809
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:55,278
Okay, I'm gonna put it down, slow.

810
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:57,948
Hold it right there.

811
01:15:58,153 --> 01:15:59,279
We got him.

812
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:01,912
Just back off.

813
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,989
Hold your fucking fire!

814
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:08,153
Repeat, all units, hold your fire!

815
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:09,888
Hold your fire!

816
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:11,865
- Get another team around the back!
- He's got nowhere to go!

817
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,767
- Out of the way. Move.
- Go, go!

818
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:33,881
Talk to me.

819
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:36,584
Turner's in the bag, SWAT's breaching
the security gate as we speak.

820
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:39,957
- What about Dalton and Griffin?
- We don't know if they're still inside, sir.

821
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:42,223
What do you mean, you don't know?

822
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:43,764
Things are very fluid, sir.

823
01:16:56,912 --> 01:17:00,075
Turner, we know who you are.
Just come on out.

824
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:13,424
Do you have a plan
to resolve this fucking situation or not?

825
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,320
Stay the hell out of my way.

826
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,130
Shit.

827
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:18,091
No, no, wait. Wait! You need me.

828
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:22,553
I can call the Institute
and have the buffer here in 10 minutes.

829
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:25,330
Listen, listen carefully.

830
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:28,962
This program can go on.
I'll make you a partner.

831
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:32,334
Working together for a greater purpose.

832
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:36,007
The cop's taken care of, Michael,
it's just us now.

833
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:37,871
I'm not Michael.

834
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:43,845
Turner?

835
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:47,983
You won't shoot me.

836
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:50,923
How do you know?
Can you see it in my eyes?

837
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:54,185
Yeah, just back away,
that's what you do best.

838
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:14,308
These clothes are for burn patients.

839
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:17,715
They'll protect you from the light
until the buffer kicks in.

840
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:21,252
How long will it take?

841
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,021
You should feel relief soon.

842
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:26,556
- Give me your arm.
- You first.

843
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,655
Half for you, half for me.

844
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:33,424
I can't be certain it'll work
without a full dose.

845
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,800
Let's give it a shot, shall we?

846
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:37,964
Not that I don't trust you.

847
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:40,439
No, I don't trust you. Come on.

848
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:50,677
There you go. Good girl.

849
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,827
Just give it a second.

850
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:14,705
I booked this room
on my expired student pass code,

851
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:19,303
so whatever decision you intend to make,
I suggest you make it quickly.

852
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:24,815
All right, I'm ready.

853
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:33,417
- I won't need this again, will I?
- No, this will do it.

854
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:41,229
- Still.
- There's the vein, right there.

855
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:43,336
Right there.

856
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:45,236
Oh, good.

857
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:55,608
Yeah.

858
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:02,217
You are a true hero, Maggie. Just like me.

859
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,925
Okay, you got what you wanted.

860
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:10,396
Perfection.

861
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:14,031
How many people in their lifetime
get to achieve it?

862
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:17,663
Perfect husband, perfect father, citizen.

863
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,332
I am none of these things,
but I am the perfect weapon,

864
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:24,508
and you perfected me.

865
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:31,612
I can get this close to people
without them ever knowing I'm there.

866
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,083
I'm sorry, Maggie.

867
01:21:57,178 --> 01:22:00,011
Very clever! Very clever, Maggie!

868
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:08,246
You're a spirited little minx, you know that?

869
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,092
Come on, Maggie, what are you running for?

870
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:15,823
Don't you get it?

871
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,065
Come on there, Maggie!

872
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:23,895
Come on, honey!

873
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:25,767
I'm gonna get you.

874
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:28,835
Come on, why are you running, honey?

875
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:30,935
I'm just gonna find you later,

876
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:33,742
take off all my clothes, and catch you.

877
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:38,513
What...

878
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:43,122
Who's there?

879
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:45,123
Guess who?

880
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:47,788
Frank!

881
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:50,692
Maggie. What did you do, Maggie?

882
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:55,532
Oh, shit.

883
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:57,865
Turner?

884
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:22,957
Frank?

885
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:40,073
Oh, shit.

886
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:46,677
- Maggie, get inside.
- Turner, he's right behind you!

887
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:51,252
I got you, Turner.

888
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:52,653
Turner!

889
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:54,491
I got you.

890
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:57,956
Son of a bitch.

891
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:01,995
- Watch out!
- You're finished!

892
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:05,929
- You really are a pain in the ass!
- Let him go. Let him go.

893
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,036
- Turner?
- You son of a bitch.

894
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:14,809
Frank?

895
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:22,583
There's nowhere left to run, Maggie.

896
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:00,390
What'd you do to me?

897
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:03,126
What was in that vial, Maggie?

898
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:07,766
Rat poison.

899
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,601
Rat poison?

900
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:16,236
That's just great. Great!

901
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:18,706
You stupid woman.

902
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:21,512
You killed yourself, too.

903
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:25,849
Warfarin, C19-H16-O4.

904
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:29,753
Your blood thins out, your heart speeds up.

905
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,823
You're hemorrhaging.

906
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:45,599
I distinctly remember telling you
to take good care of me.

907
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:50,902
You did a real shitty job.

908
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:09,822
Do you feel it yet, Turner?

909
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,128
What it does to you?

910
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:15,597
Not yet.

911
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:21,905
Now I do.

912
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:12,149
There's still no sign of him.

913
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:13,660
Don't worry.

914
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,826
He'll come find me.

915
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,271
<i>He has to.</i>
