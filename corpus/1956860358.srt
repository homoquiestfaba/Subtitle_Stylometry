00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:26,217
I'm not sure they'll
go for a script
about suicide.

164
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,392
It's not about suicide.

165
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,177
It's about
an artist's courage.

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,180

to kill himself.
I won't change that.

00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,878

I'm not asking you
to change that.

168
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:37,098
It's an important element.
I find it very moving,

169
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:40,667
but maybe
it could be handled
a little differently.

170
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,494
Does he have
to kill himself?

171
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:44,453
Couldn't he just
leave town at the end?

172
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:47,543
The whole point is
that he's destroyed
by society.

173
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,979
No, he can't just leave.

174
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:52,156
What if he was killed
in an accident?

175
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,290

the same teachers as

has some very,
very interesting ideas.

made this film
years ago

182
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:10,174
if I wanted to play
footsie-wootsie.

183
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:12,002
Marvin, we're
just talking here.

184
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:12,829
I knew it.

185
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:15,832
I'm not
changing one word!

186
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:18,226
I don't need
to make this film,

187
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:20,271
and I don't need
your sandwich.

188
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:21,795
Let's...let's just
forget it, o.K.?

189
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:25,059
Jesus, I love
your passion.
It's so refreshing.

190
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:26,582
I was at universal
years ago

191
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,933
when Nick ray
threw a projector
out of a window.

192
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:33,241
This is what
a good director
has to have, Stuart.

193
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:35,547
I'm just here
to be used.

194
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:37,071
Cheeseburger...

195
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:39,116
Oh, that's uh...

196
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,292
Turkey...

197
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,033
And shrimp...

198
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,208
And the ketchup,

199
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:47,124
and I'll bring your coke.

200
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:50,040
Maybe I am a little
too apprehensive,

201
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,172
but it's because

202
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:54,044
I want to get
this picture made, Marvin.

203
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:57,091
Maybe I'm being
too cautious.

204
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,442
Why don't you meet
my money guy?

205
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:04,576
My gut tells me
he'll like you.

206
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,100
He's going
to finance the film?

207
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:08,363
Very interesting guy.
He's a real player,

208
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,888
and he's got this girl.
I think she's terrific.

209
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,194
She really has something.

210
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:16,371
She's cute as a button,
but decide for yourself.

211
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:17,241
Decide what?

212
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:19,243
He wants her
in the movie.

213
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:22,246
I have
to give her a role?

214
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,813
A role?

215
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:26,120
Depends on what
you mean by a role.

216
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:31,168
He wants a little something
to get her career going.

217
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:41,178
Problem?

218
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:42,832
Yeah. This thing
with the girlfriend...

219
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:46,270
Marvin,
I need to make
a good picture.

220
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:49,099
If she isn't
right for the part,

221
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:52,363
I won't let you cast her.

222
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,377
[Telephone rings]

223
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:09,119
Hello.

224
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,730
Marvin?

225
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:11,818
Oh, hi. Rachel.

226
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,297
Yeah. Your wife.
Remember?

227
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:15,169
Didn't sound
like you.

228
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,126
You're so up.

229
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,215
I was just eating
a sandwich.

230
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:20,391
I'm in the subway,
so we'll talk fast.

231
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:23,655
I'm going
to the lawyers
to clinch this deal

232
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,267
before Mr. Momolio
changes his mind.

233
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,138
You pulled it off?

234
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,574
I pulled it off.

235
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,751
He'll lease US
the restaurant space
incredibly cheap,

236
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:34,492
and he's coming in
as a partner.

237
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:35,798
So it's happening.

238
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:37,191
Marvin,
the train's coming.

239
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:40,107
There's a
position opening in
the drama department

240
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,151
at queens college.

241
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,066
They're very
interested in you.

242
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,634
I hear they have
a beautiful
theater there.

243
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:48,115
We'll have
a great time
in New York.

244
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:50,987
Here's my train.
Bye. I love you.

245
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:53,033
I love you, too, honey.

246
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:54,425
Hey, congratulations.

247
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:56,601
[Dial tone]

248
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:12,966
Darn it.

249
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,285
I don't see
the soup.

250
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,852
There's
too much kasha.

251
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:32,159
Did they put in
any soup?

252
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:36,119
It's in there
if you look.

253
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:40,907
You're lucky
you got served.

254
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,256
Same old place.

255
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:43,823
Been here forever.
Forever.

256
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,738
I know it's
the same old place.

257
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:49,829
You're not telling me
something new.

258
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,963
It's Marvin, right?

259
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:54,703
Right.

260
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:56,661
Where are you from?

261
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,272
New York.

262
00:13:58,315 --> 00:13:59,534
New York.

263
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:02,885
Then you
probably don't
remember my store.

264
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:06,193
I had the biggest
clock store
on the west coast.

265
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:08,238
Everybody bought
their clocks from me...

266
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,371
people in the business,
your business.

267
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:13,156
So I know something
about this.

268
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,637
What did you think
of the script?

269
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,856
I didn't read it.

270
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,163
It looked professional,
and Peggy likes it.

271
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,295
It's a terrific script.

272
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:23,471
Of course you think
it's terrific.

273
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:25,299
It's your job
to say that.

274
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:28,563
What are you
going to say,
that it's shit?

275
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:30,130
George.
Let them talk.

276
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:31,522
Peggy, darling.

277
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:32,523
Be quiet.

278
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:35,309
You make things hard
when you talk.

279
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:38,312
A businessperson
you're not.

280
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:48,148
There's not
too much chicken fat
in this soup.

281
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:51,499
Usually, I don't get
a good bowl of soup

282
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,283
unless I go
to New York.

283
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:57,026
There's no integrity
in the restaurant
business anymore.

284
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,072
My father says
the same thing.

285
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:01,030
Your father
is a smart man.

286
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:04,207
So, what are you
in this team?

287
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,557
I'm sort of associated
with the project.

288
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:09,473
Stuart had
the same teachers
in college

289
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:11,127
as Steven Spielberg.

290
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:14,348
So have a lot
of other people.

291
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:16,480
Marvin.

292
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:18,004
Marvin. Right?

293
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:19,135
Listen.

294
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,138
What part are you
going to give my Peggy

295
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:24,619
in your film?

296
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,839
Well, uh,
I'm not sure.

297
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,972
I really haven't
thought about it.

298
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,713
I'd like to get
to know her.

299
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:34,934
There's a part
in your script
that she wants.

300
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,980
What's the name
of the part, Peggy?

301
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:38,981
Zoey.

302
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:40,026
Zoey.

303
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:42,811
Yeah. The girlfriend.
She's so deep.

304
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:46,162
Yes. Yes.
It's a great part.

305
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:47,337
It's
a wonderful part.

306
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,339
But there's
another great part,

307
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:52,647
the part of
the painter's model.

308
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,954
The prostitute?

309
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,957
It's not as big
a part, but...

310
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,264
It isn't the size of
the role that matters.

311
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,832
It's easy
for you to say.

312
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,138
But it's my money,

313
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,140
and she'll play
a big part.

314
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:08,750
But it's my movie.

315
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:10,230
I could have done it

316
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:13,233
with a big
television star
years ago,

317
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:14,495
but I didn't.

318
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:18,151
She was wrong
for the role.

319
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:22,285
Maybe I don't have
to play the girlfriend.

320
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:23,330
What?

321
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:26,159
You know, Marilyn
became a big star

322
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,551
after asphalt jungle,

323
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,424
and she only did
one scene.

324
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:31,294
Sure.

325
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,644
The point is
to be noticed.

326
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:34,819
Listen to me.

327
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:38,084
Peggy will do anything
to get into a movie,

328
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:39,215
but I'm her promoter.

329
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,131
You don't get
any of my money

330
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:43,480
so that she can play

331
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:47,093
what you guys call
an important
but tiny part.

332
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:48,746
I'm a smart guy, too.

333
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,966
George, just let them
talk about it.

334
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,100
So many things
can happen before
a movie's finished.

335
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:55,536
There's rehearsal,
casting, editing.

336
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:59,235
The prostitute
could go
from 2 scenes to 20,

337
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,497
stealing
the entire film.

338
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,196
If the prostitute
is the biggest part,

339
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,980
then that's the part
she'll play.

340
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,810
I don't know if she
can play that part
or any part.

341
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:10,725
Look, look, look.
He's getting upset.

342
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:13,423
I can't deal
with someone
who gets upset

343
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,208
because I say
what I want.

344
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,948
To me,
it's just business.

345
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:19,647
The script is very
important to him.

346
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,996
Speak
for yourself.

347
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,258
Guys,
get this together.

348
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:24,521
I like to communicate
with people,

349
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:27,698
but the other person
has to be someplace

350
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:30,005
for me to communicate
with them.

351
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,530
Peggy and I took
the form seminar,
you know.

352
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:37,143
We were in communicator
classes together.

353
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:40,972
Don't cast me if
you don't like me.

354
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,757
No. I like you.

355
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,628
Marvin.

356
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,109
You look like
a nice boy.

357
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,372
You're probably
very talented, too,

358
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,071
but it's
my money, huh?

359
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,161
Make a decision
and get back to me.

360
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:57,119
Andiamo,peggy.

361
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:58,425
Let's go.

362
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:02,777
No, no.
You don't have
to get up.

363
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,866
Why did you...

364
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:06,824
All right.

365
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:14,484
I'll call you.

366
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:29,151
Who is he,
saying the script
isn't finished?

367
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,327
I've worked on
that script for years.

368
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:33,024
Who the fuck is he?

369
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:35,201
He's a little green.
He made a mistake.

370
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:36,811
Who the fuck is he?

371
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:40,858
What does
he even have to do
with this film?

372
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:42,077
I thought you knew.

373
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,819
No. Why was he even
at this meeting?

374
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:45,907
Jack, who is he?

375
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,257
You've never heard
of Stuart stratland?

376
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,389
Stuart stratland?

377
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:50,607
Two academy awards.

378
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:52,696
He wrote
sound in the river,

379
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,829
death by
any other name.

380
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:57,658
Yeah. How...
He's so young.

381
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:58,702
Not him.

382
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:00,182
That's his son,
Stuart stratland Jr.

383
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:02,793
He's just
out of college.

384
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:03,751
His son.

385
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:06,014
What are we doing
with his son?

386
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:07,233
I know his father.

387
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:08,408
He loves this kid.

388
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:11,889
If we get in trouble
with the script,

389
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,195
he'll help US out.

390
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:16,155
You know how much
the guy gets?
500,000 easy.

391
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:19,114
It's like getting
the father for free.

392
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,289
Besides,
this kid wrote

393
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,205
a very funny
Sci-Fi thing
about aliens.

394
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:25,207
This film is
about people, Jack.

395
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,122
He's trouble.
I don't need him.

396
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,864
Did you hear
what he said
to George?

397
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,387
Yeah. You're
absolutely right.

398
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:33,215
He was way
out of line.

399
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,739
If you want him out,
he's out.

400
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:38,220
But George seemed
to like him a lot,

401
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:41,092
and that could
come in very handy

402
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,529
when we close the deal.

403
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:46,533
I don't want
to blow this thing
over something minor.

404
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:50,406
I don't like the way
George tried to bully me.

405
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,320
Oh, that
was terrible.

406
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:53,931
I'm glad the way
you stood up.

407
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,672
He deserved
to be told off.

408
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:58,849
I was seething
just listening
to him.

409
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:01,461
Do you really think
he'll do it?

410
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:02,810
He's a tough nut.

411
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:06,596
He's trying to prove
what a big schlong
he's got.

412
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,032
It's all bullshit.

413
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,382
She's getting
restless.

414
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:11,427
That's why
he came to me.

415
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:12,907
She likes
your script.

416
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,257
Make her happy,
and we're in.

417
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:16,258
I can't use her.

418
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:18,652
Would it hurt
to audition her?

419
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:19,914
She's not a dog.

420
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:22,830
I wouldn't mind
getting her alone
in a room.

421
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,658
Why can't she play
the prostitute?

422
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:28,183
Even if she could,
George won't let her.

423
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,055
We land some sort
of a name

424
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,231
to play the painter,

425
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,363
the little girl
finds out

426
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,322
she's playing
opposite a star,

427
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:37,497
she'll
take anything.

428
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,803
George will
roll over
and spread-eagle.

429
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,979
Can I do a song?

430
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:42,937
A song?

431
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,243
There's no singing
in your film,

432
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:47,289
but there's a lot
of acting in singing.

433
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,986
No. That's
just fine.

434
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,336
Good.

435
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:54,296
Great,
'cause I've been
working on this song

436
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,385
that I'm supposed
to perform

437
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,344
at this club
in ventura.

438
00:20:58,387 --> 00:20:59,954
Actually, George's
friend's the owner.

439
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:03,784
And don't worry
about what George
said the other day.

440
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,569
His bite's a lot
worse than his bark.

441
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,005
He really likes you.

442
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,529
He really
likes you a lot.

443
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:12,314
He just doesn't
understand
US people in art.

444
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,142
This song
works really great

445
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:18,320
if the speakers
are just
the right distance.

446
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:21,758
So, have you done
a lot of acting?

447
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:22,803
Oh, yeah.

448
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:25,022
I had all the leads
in high school,

449
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:28,330
but I really didn't
learn anything
until fullerton.

450
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:30,332
What's fullerton?

451
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,116
Cal state fullerton?

452
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,902
I had
a great teacher...
Mr. Brocker.

453
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:37,034
He was famous
and on Broadway.

454
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:38,384
And I did betrayal.

455
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:40,299
He said
I was very good.

456
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,605
I didn't make
any money
as an actress,

457
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:45,478
so I became
a waitress
at the lighthouse.

458
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:47,044
That's
where you sing

459
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:49,090
while you wait
on tables.

460
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:51,266
My boss
came on to me,

461
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,354
then I got fired,

462
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,400
then my house
burned down.

463
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:57,272
That's how
I ended up
with George.

464
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,360
I see.

465
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:02,408
You want to push
that button for me?

466
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:06,803

even if it
blows the deal.

476
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:27,302
Go with your instincts.

477
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,347
You're the director.

478
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,305
I'll never force
anything on you.

479
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,221
Besides, she doesn't
want to do it.

480
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:34,527
What?

481
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,660
George got her
a screen test
for a horror film.

482
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,053
When did
this happen?

483
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:39,967
Last night.

484
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,404
She was all excited
about it.

485
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:45,015
Here I am
giving her a chance

486
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,930
to be in
a real film.

487
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,323
If it's
released right,

488
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,194
she's got
a film career.

489
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:52,893
What is she playing
in this horror film?

490
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:54,721
A hooker
who gets knifed.

491
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:57,898
That's really
going to help her.

492
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:01,249
I tried to talk her
out of it.

493
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:04,295
Sweet kid.

494
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:11,346
So, um...

495
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:15,350
I guess this is it.

496
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:17,918
Hey. We got
a script.

497
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:19,093
It needs some work,

498
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,312
but it's basically
in the right direction.

499
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:24,098
We got a director
with a hard-on
out to here.

500
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:27,797
How many
classy projects
are there out there?

501
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:31,279
Honey, we'll order
in a couple of minutes.

502
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:32,802
I couldn't
sleep last night.

503
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:37,024
I was going through
the index card
in my head.

504
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,112
I got someone.

505
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:39,896
There's no question
that he's holding,

506
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,333
not like some pricks
that'll break your balls

507
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:44,074
and there's
nothing there.

508
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,337
He's got
a girl, too.

509
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:49,384
Mister rasso...

510
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,690
Hey, how are you?

511
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,039
So you're back, huh?

512
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:55,172
Paris seems
to agree with you.
Look at that tan.

513
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,696
How was hialeah?

514
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:58,262
I made a few bucks.

515
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:01,440
I'll bet you did.
I love that track.
It's fast.

516
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,138
Who do you like
in the fifth?

517
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:05,922
The fifth?
Dolls of plenty.

518
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,097
So be it.

519
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:08,664
How's that stewardess?
Still flying around?

520
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:12,973
She works a couple
days a week, mostly
to Denver and back.

521
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:15,497
You're lucky
you got to her first,

522
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,151
because I really
liked her.

523
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:18,979
I got a feeling
about her.

524
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:21,068
I really think
she's got something.

525
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,591
She been doing
anything lately?

526
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:26,943
She did a commercial
for a friend of mine
four months ago.

527
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:29,250
Hardware stores?
It's a tough life.

528
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:30,338
It sure is.

529
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:34,560
Give me 100 to win on 5
in the fourth.

530
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:35,648
Thank you.

531
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,955
5 on 5 to win.

532
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:42,524
That girl's really
crazy about you.
I can tell you that.

533
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:44,134
She's a real winner,
carmine.

534
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:47,050
I don't like
to hear it, Jack.

535
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:50,097
[Call to the gate
playing]

536
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:57,931
She wants to marry me
and have a baby.

537
00:24:57,974 --> 00:24:59,454
Can you imagine?

538
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,455
Wonderful!

539
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,284
Are you crazy?
With my background?

540
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,459
Jack, I'm so sick.

541
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,854
I found myself cheating
on her last week.

542
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:08,985
Really?

543
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,161
Every time she starts
talking about it,

544
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:16,166
I find myself having to
cheat on her or something.

545
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,777
Christ.

546
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,214
I'm too sick.
I don't deserve her.

547
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:22,346
She's been sober
for nine months.

548
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,652
Her a.A. Cake's
coming up.

549
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:27,569
I'll never forgive myself
if I blow it for her.

550
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:30,964
I got to get a beer.

551
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:33,401
Carmine...

552
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:05,215
Sugar, don't forget
the onion rings
and the great slaw.

553
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:09,393
Can you bring US
some onion rings
and slaw right away?

554
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,091
Thank you.

555
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:14,747
Movies, huh?

556
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,052
I like movie people.

557
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:18,794
I used to play tennis
with some

558
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:21,362
before I almost croaked
from a heart attack.

559
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:23,930
Movie people are freer.
They do what they want.

560
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:26,410
They're not afraid
to use their heads.

561
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:28,891
They don't put up
with the bullshit

562
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:31,502
dished out by the
assholes of the world.

563
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:32,895
That's what
my father says.

564
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:35,811
[Carmine]
I never been involved
in a movie before.

565
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:36,943
It might be fun.

566
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:38,858
So much blood
in the world,

567
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:41,425
might as well
have a good time.

568
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:43,384
Too many people
getting blown apart

569
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:44,951
before they have
a chance.

570
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:46,648
Sounds like
it might be fun.

571
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:52,828
I was in special forces.
I seen a few things.

572
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:54,221
In 'nam?

573
00:26:54,264 --> 00:26:55,657
And all around it.

574
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:56,745
It was terrible.

575
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,094
Don't listen
to the bullshit

576
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:00,488
about not getting a chance
to win that war.

577
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:02,969
We did every dirty trick
we could think of.

578
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:06,146
Those little guys still
beat the shit out of US.

579
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:08,539
I can tell you about
things that happened

580
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:11,760
that would make your hair
stand on end.

581
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:13,109
I hid in a tree

582
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:17,766
while I watched my buddy
get quartered down below.

583
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:22,771
Anyhow...

584
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:27,689
The idea of making
an entertaining
little film

585
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:29,343
is a good one.

586
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:32,259
What's it about?

587
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:34,435
You didn't read
the script?

588
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:39,396
No. I'd rather get it
from the horse's mouth.

589
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:42,356
Well, um...

590
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:47,013
It's a story
about a painter.

591
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,754
A painter.

592
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:50,451
Yeah,
a very special one.

593
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:54,411
His work has a very deep
effect on people.

594
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,457
It's, uh,
sort of magical.

595
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,285
It, uh,
it changes them.

596
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:01,027
He can't stop himself
from criticizing things

597
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,245
that he sees are wrong.

598
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:03,551
He's committed
to the truth,

599
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:08,556
and, uh, that brings him
both great pain and joy.

600
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,819
Sounds like
a manic-depressive.

601
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:12,299
I know guys like that.

602
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:14,431
Is the whole thing
about him?

603
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:17,957
No, no, there...there's
the gallery owner.

604
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,958
He's interesting.

605
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:20,263
He's fascinated
by the painter.

606
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:27,488
He tries to help him,
but then he destroys him.

607
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,664
Aren't there any
women in this film?

608
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:34,190
Well, sure, sure.
There's the gallery
owner's girlfriend.

609
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:36,671
Uh, she's a very
special girl.

610
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,238
She's drawn
to the, uh...

611
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,240
To the painter
and his ideas,

612
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:44,026
and, um,
he's charmed by her.

613
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,072
He...he, uh...

614
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:48,552
He teaches her,
but, uh...

615
00:28:48,596 --> 00:28:50,467
But then lots
of things happen.

616
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:53,732
In the end, she goes back
to the gallery owner.

617
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:56,865
Sounds like
a great plot, huh?

618
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:00,695
Yes, but there's
also another great
woman's role...

619
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,349
uh, the model.

620
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:03,306
She's, uh...

621
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,569
She's, uh...
She's a prostitute.

622
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:06,788
But she's, uh...

623
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:10,313
Anyhow,
the painter paints her.

624
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:11,532
And then what?

625
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:15,797
And then she takes
her money and leaves.

626
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,843
She's a whore?

627
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:21,803
You mind if I
say something?

628
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:22,673
Please do.

629
00:29:22,717 --> 00:29:24,023
The prostitute's
the only one

630
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:25,459
who can see
the painter

631
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:26,939
for who
he really is.

632
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:29,245
She doesn't
put up with
the bullshit

633
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:32,335
dished out by
the assholes
of the world.

634
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:33,815
The prostitute
has no
illusions.

635
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:38,472
Yet, in a way,
she is more pure

636
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:39,908
than anyone
in the film.

637
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:43,869
That's interesting.
Is he working on
the script, too?

638
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,392
Oh, yeah.

639
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:48,787
Stuart here studied
with the same teachers
as Spielberg.

640
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,875
Aha! Ooh!

641
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:50,876
Wow!

642
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,878
All right, all right.
O.K., uh...

643
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:55,315
So the gallery owner
is, uh...

644
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:58,622
Ends up with
the girlfriend.

645
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:01,103
This is fun.

646
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:04,498
Now, what happens
to the painter?

647
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:08,328
Does he marry
the prostitute?

648
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:11,331
Um...something
happens to him.

649
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:12,811
What?

650
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,856
He...

651
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,423
He passes away.

652
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:17,380
He dies.

653
00:30:17,424 --> 00:30:19,078
Oh, death.

654
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:20,166
That's depressing.

655
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,645
No, it's not!

656
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:23,560
You know
the Phoenix,
carmine?

657
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:24,387
A rebirth!

658
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:25,867
Not a depressing
death, no.

659
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:27,173
See, the gallery
owner

660
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:29,262
takes over
the painter's
persona

661
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:31,873
and is finally
able to fulfill
his own dreams.

662
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:33,570
The painter
becomes
immortal,

663
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:34,484
and
the two lovers

664
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:36,312
have been
brought
together.

665
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:38,314
What a story!

666
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:45,756
I see.

667
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:47,454
I see!

668
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:51,588
So what happens?
How does the guy die?

669
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:55,462
Suicide.

670
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,943
Oh, Jesus!

671
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:01,642
Is there any humor
in the film?

672
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:02,556
Humor?

673
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,950
Oh, yeah, sure.
A lot!

674
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:05,646
It...

675
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:07,517
It's sad,
but funny.

676
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:11,391
You mean kind of like
terms of endearment?

677
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,263
Exactly.
Terms of endearment.

678
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:15,830
Terms
of endearment.

679
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,484
Boy, was that
a winner.

680
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:19,225
Yeah, I love comedy.

681
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:21,270
[Carmine]
She's very
good at it.

682
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:23,185
That's what I do best.

683
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:26,188
In its own way,
it's very funny.

684
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:29,017
So, Marvin,
when could we
read the script?

685
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:32,151
Imminently.

686
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,240
Well, looks like
we got a deal.

687
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:37,373
All we have to do
is make the script funny.

688
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:40,115
I spent five years
writing that script.

689
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,683
I'm not saying
throw it all away,

690
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:44,946
just lighten it up
a bit.

691
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,382
Lighten it up?

692
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:49,342
It's about a painter
who's forced
to jump from a roof.

693
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:52,562
What's the point
of the film...
the main point?

694
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:55,261
Well, it's about
a man who...

695
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:56,610
it's about an artist

696
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,438
who'd rather kill himself
than compromise, right?

697
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:00,222
No, that's not...
yeah, but...

698
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:01,876
there's other stuff
about relationships

699
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,749
and the symbol thing,
where the bird flies
out of the painting.

700
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,926
Want to make your
statement? Fine.

701
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:10,102
I'm just saying
use humor.

702
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:11,059
What humor?

703
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:12,321
Like the painter.

704
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:15,107
All he does is complain
throughout the script.

705
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,499
No, he doesn't.

706
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:19,372
O.k., for instance,
does he have to be
a sad drunk?

707
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:21,591
Why not make him
a happy drunk?

708
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:23,985
He could be funny
and crazy and wild...

709
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:27,032
destructive,
but with a kind
of irreverent wit,

710
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:29,860
like Jack Nicholson.

711
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:36,519
What do I do
with the prostitute?

712
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:39,218
That's the only part
she can play.

713
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:41,394
She gets two scenes,
one line.

714
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:42,743
She won't go
for that.

715
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:45,050
How about if when
he first meets
the prostitute,

716
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:46,834
she doesn't want
to be painted?

717
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:49,532
She'll sleep with him
but won't pose nude.

718
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:50,969
It's against her ethics.

719
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:52,796
That sounds
like a joke.

720
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,102
People are complex,
Marvin.

721
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:57,279
He tries to teach
the prostitute
how to paint.

722
00:32:57,323 --> 00:33:00,065
She reveals
she once tried
to kill herself.

723
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:02,284
That would foreshadow
the whole thing.

724
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:04,286
But the painter
isn't a prostitute.

725
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,375
Drawing a parallel
between suicides...

726
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,768
but that's the point!

727
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:09,509
She doesn't kill herself.
She becomes a prostitute!

728
00:33:09,552 --> 00:33:13,339
And the painter
refuses to prostitute
himself and dies.

729
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:14,731
Right?

730
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:17,343
So the artist
is different from
the prostitute...

731
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:20,215
Because?

732
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:22,478
O.k., outline
a few ideas,

733
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:25,394
but nothing goes
into the script

734
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:27,701
unless I approve it.

735
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:30,356
You got that?

736
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,966
Oh, I'm from all over.

737
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,446
Eight states,
three foreign countries.

738
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:37,276
I was an army brat...
well, maybe just a brat.

739
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:41,236
My senior year
I spent in the aleutians.

740
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,369
Really? That must
have been strange.

741
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:45,414
No, no, it was interesting.
It was fun.

742
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:49,462
I went to an eskimo school,
listened to the radio a lot.

743
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:51,420
Of course,
it's cold up there.

744
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:54,119
Oh, yeah, I can imagine.

745
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:55,685
Before I was 10,

746
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,471
I lived in one place
all the time...
weirton, West Virginia.

747
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:03,258
I remember everything
was broken down there.

748
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:04,912
It was all grimy.

749
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:08,481
There was black smoke
that used to come out
of the steel mill

750
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:10,526
in the middle of the town.

751
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,398
But I had lots of dolls.

752
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:16,358
I used to play house
a lot. It was fun.

753
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:18,317
Was your father
stationed there?

754
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,449
No, no.

755
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:24,540
My other father...
my real father.

756
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:27,717
Oh, yeah?
What was he like?

757
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:28,849
He's handsome.

758
00:34:28,892 --> 00:34:34,463
He had a wonderful
sense of humor.

759
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:36,030
Do you still see him?

760
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,512
No, no, we used to,
you know,

761
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:43,385
but it's better now
that we don't,

762
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,299
you know?

763
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:48,695
He loves me a lot.
I know that.

764
00:34:48,738 --> 00:34:50,827
I...

765
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:53,395
He...he just has
trouble showing it.

766
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:57,356
Some...some people
are like that.

767
00:34:57,399 --> 00:35:01,011
You know, he thinks
about me a lot.

768
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:01,882
I...i...

769
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:04,537
I can feel it.

770
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,843
And sometimes
I just sit,

771
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:09,716
and I close my eyes,

772
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:12,762
and...

773
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:16,636
Just feel his love...

774
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,944
Floating towards me.

775
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:33,174
He sent me a card
a few years ago.

776
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,400
I...I'm ready.

777
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:48,972
[Sounding like
an old lady]
Betsy!

778
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:51,366
Betsy,
where are you?

779
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,412
Betsy!

780
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:56,154
Carmine's ready
to strike a deal.

781
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:58,286
So that's it. I mean,
we're in business!

782
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:01,724
We're better
than in business.
We're on a roll.

783
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:03,335
The first money's
the hardest.

784
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:06,076
First money?
What do you mean?

785
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,382
Carmine's putting up
first money.

786
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:09,819
We'll get the rest
someplace else.

787
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:11,908
Not all the money?

788
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:13,083
He went for half.

789
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:15,695
So we're back where
we started from!

790
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:17,044
Marvin,
will you relax?

791
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:18,393
That's the beauty
of the thing.

792
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:21,440
Carmine has
this friend
who's loaded,

793
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:22,963
really loaded.

794
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:26,227
It just so happens
he has this
girlfriend.

795
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:30,231
[Violin playing]

796
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:33,495
We're here to see
Mr. Wright.

797
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:35,454
Oui.

798
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:40,241
Thank you, sir.

799
00:36:46,421 --> 00:36:48,554
Mr. Wright.

800
00:36:48,597 --> 00:36:50,730
Thank you, sir.

801
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:55,256
The script is going to
need some changes.

802
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,389
Changes? What kind
of changes?

803
00:36:57,432 --> 00:36:59,826
Carmine doesn't care if
this film makes money.

804
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:02,394
You don't either,
because you're an artist.

805
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:05,353
But if I'm investing
in this film,

806
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:06,833
it will make a profit.

807
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:08,008
What you have here

808
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:10,184
is a very, very
dark, morbid script.

809
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,664
I actually
kind of liked it,

810
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:15,929
but it'll roll over and die
when it hits the market.

811
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:18,758
I'm lightening it up,
putting in some humor.

812
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:21,978
You'll have a light
morbid script with
humor that'll bomb.

813
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,328
Either way, I lose money.

814
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:25,852
I thought you wanted
to do this movie
because of...

815
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:28,420
Beverly? That's one reason.
I need more than one.

816
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:31,510
If I'm doing it,
we're doing it my way.

817
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:32,946
Input can be helpful.

818
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:35,731
Arty films are
making money these days,

819
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,124
but you need to appeal

820
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,301
to an audience's
basic motive for
going to a movie.

821
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:41,520
To be entertained.

822
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:42,869
No, to be titillated...

823
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:45,915
to go to the movies to be
titillated, to see sex.

824
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:49,310
There's no sex in your film.
You need more sex.

825
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:52,270
There is some.
It's just not obvi...

826
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:55,795
[cellular phone rings]

827
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:56,796
Yes.

828
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:58,058
I've confirmed
those reservations.

829
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:00,974
Make sure you get me
the room with the terrace.

830
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:02,671
Find out about that boat.

831
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:03,759
Yes, sir.

832
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:04,891
Good.

833
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:07,633
Isn't your film
about self-destruction?

834
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:10,462
Well, sex is a form
of self-destruction.

835
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,768
As the photographer
becomes more disturbed,

836
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:13,943
his sexual obsessions

837
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:17,207
begin to dominate
and destroy his life.

838
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,600
The photographer?

839
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:20,298
The painter's
a photographer.

840
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:21,429
It's much more
contemporary.

841
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:23,692
He should be photographing
nude women.

842
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:25,477
His art
and his sexuality

843
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,044
should be forever fighting
and chained together,

844
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:30,438
distorting each other's
emotions, and...

845
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:32,875
that's the way I see it.

846
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,660
Great idea!

847
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:36,096
I hear
the editing room

848
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:38,490
is where real decisions
are made,

849
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:41,231
so I or somebody
from my office

850
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:42,363
will supervise editing.

851
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:43,973
You got to be
kidding...

852
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:45,540
Marvin, Marvin...

853
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:47,455
Mr. Wright, I understand
your thoughts.

854
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:52,852
I wouldn't be who
I am if I didn't
back my director

855
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:54,201
on certain matters.

856
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:56,812
Roth, you're three months
behind on your mortgage.

857
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:57,900
Your last two pictures

858
00:38:57,944 --> 00:38:59,032
destroyed whatever
reputation you had.

859
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:01,513
The only decent picture
you ever made

860
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:03,471
is credited
to the kid's father.

861
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:06,822
Don't bullshit me.
I don't like it!

862
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:10,260
We respect what
you're saying.
Jack's only trying...

863
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:12,393
how old are you, son?

864
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:13,351
24.

865
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:15,222
Talk to me
in five years.

866
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:16,310
Marvin,
save your temperament

867
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,616
for when you can
afford it.

868
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:20,880
You have more to lose
than either of these guys.

869
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:22,490
Be honest.
Your life's a disaster.

870
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:25,319
Your last film folded when
that actor killed himself.

871
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,886
You haven't done
anything since.

872
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:29,367
You're 42,
you live in a shithole,

873
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,933
you direct
instructional tapes.

874
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:33,327
I'm willing
to give you a chance

875
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,808
because I think you might be
desperate enough

876
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:38,071
to make this film work.

877
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:39,507
You think I'm an asshole
with money.

878
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:41,204
I'm actually
an interesting guy.

879
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:43,163
Maybe one day
you'll know me.

880
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:44,469
We're not so different,
Marvin.

881
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:47,472
It's just that I create
money, that's my art.

882
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:48,647
I'm very good at it.

883
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,694
Once I make a deal,
I'm a man of my word.

884
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:54,957
Think about it.

885
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:57,830
Thank you.

886
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,095
So, when do we,
uh, all get to meet

887
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:03,705
your fabulous
friend Beverly?

888
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:05,098
I'll give you her number.

889
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:08,449
We're not seen in public.
My wife wouldn't like it.

890
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:09,711
It's excellent.

891
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:11,321
Shall we eat, gentlemen?

892
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:12,453
I'm on the pritikin diet,

893
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:15,543
but the frogs' legs
are excellent.

894
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:20,461
He's right about
one thing...

895
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,245
I am desperate.

896
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,465
Hey, none of US
are in great shape.

897
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:30,036
Listen, Marvin,
I got a hide like
a rhinoceros.

898
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,342
I have to.
I'm a producer.

899
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:33,518
Money is money.

900
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:36,346
Tell me how much
you can take,

901
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,652
because whatever
it is,

902
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:40,133
uncle Jack
is behind you.

903
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,267
A nude photographer

904
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:45,660
chained
to his sexuality?

905
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:48,489
What is he
talking about?

906
00:40:50,143 --> 00:40:53,363
There's always a way.

907
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,627
Stuart's a clever kid.

908
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,150
Let him play with it.

909
00:40:57,193 --> 00:41:01,328
Maybe he'll make it
work for everybody.

910
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:07,421
Am I really
considering this?

911
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:24,830
I want the lead role.

912
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:27,441
I don't care what part
little miss airlines gets,

913
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,139
but it better be
smaller than mine.

914
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:31,532
I'll count the lines.

915
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:33,621
I want a heavy,
dramatic role.

916
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:35,580
I won't do
any nude scenes

917
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:37,495
unless absolutely
necessary

918
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:38,583
and tastefully done.

919
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:41,324
I'm not strutting
my black ass around

920
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:43,022
to give the grips
a thrill.

921
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:46,242
I want to sit down alone
with the director

922
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:47,417
and check him out.

923
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:49,681
I'm not going
to get jerked around.

924
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:52,510
The moment I get
the slightest indication

925
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:55,251
you people
are not on the level,

926
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:57,340
I will wipe you out,

927
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:58,646
and I can do it.

928
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,519
Not only am I making it
with Mr. Evan m. Wright,

929
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:04,739
but I also happen to be
screwing Mr. Carmine rasso,

930
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:08,526
who also has an interest
in this project.

931
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:12,921
That's right.

932
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,576
I'm fucking
both your investors,

933
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:19,537
so don't fuck with me.

934
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:24,150
Any questions?

935
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,068
You know, I've never
had Sushi before.

936
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:34,160
My voices were right.

937
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:37,337
You think that life
is nothing

938
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,079
but not being stone dead.

939
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:44,344
I could let the trumpets
and banners and soldiers

940
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:45,650
pass me by

941
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:50,002
if only I could still hear
the wind in the trees,

942
00:42:50,045 --> 00:42:52,482
the larks in the sunshine,

943
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:56,399
and the blessed, blessed
church bells

944
00:42:56,443 --> 00:42:58,445
that send
my angels' voices

945
00:42:58,488 --> 00:43:01,579
floating to me
on the wind.

946
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:06,366
Without these things,

947
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:08,455
I cannot live.

948
00:43:08,498 --> 00:43:11,545
And by your wanting
to take them away from me

949
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,764
or from
any human creature,

950
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:16,594
I know that your counsel
is that of the devil

951
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:20,249
and that mine...

952
00:43:21,076 --> 00:43:23,862
Is of god.

953
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:28,606
You're
a very good actress.

954
00:43:32,044 --> 00:43:33,741
Mm-hmm.

955
00:43:33,785 --> 00:43:36,352
You know,
that was very good.

956
00:43:36,396 --> 00:43:37,440
I was pushing.

957
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:39,355
No, I didn't
get that.

958
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:40,530
Well, I was.

959
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:43,403
What are we doing here?
I liked it, o.K.?

960
00:43:43,446 --> 00:43:47,407
I've looked into
your background.

961
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,279
Not much there.

962
00:43:50,323 --> 00:43:52,804
What did you find out?
Anything good?

963
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:56,024
You directed some
pretty serious
stage stuff

964
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:57,069
in New York.

965
00:43:57,112 --> 00:43:59,288
Then you made
a classy little film.

966
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:03,989
The New York times
said you showed promise.

967
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:07,035
I suppose I was
doing pretty good.

968
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:10,212
And then you came
to Hollywood.

969
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:12,867
Yeah, then I came
to Hollywood.

970
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:14,608
Anyway, you, though...

971
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,089
you know, you're...

972
00:44:17,132 --> 00:44:20,222
obviously you must
be offered roles.

973
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:23,573
I want a movie
where I get to
use my talent.

974
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:25,532
The only things
I get offered

975
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,665
are either porno
or horror films.

976
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:28,883
Carmine liked you,

977
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:32,582
thought it might be
good for me.

978
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:33,583
Carmine's...

979
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:35,455
A g-good friend?

980
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:38,937
You want to ask
me something?
Ask me straight out.

981
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,982
I don't like to be
manipulated.

982
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:43,158
Now, this is
where it's at...

983
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:47,336
Evan taught carmine tennis
when he was a tennis pro.

984
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,512
Carmine backed his first
racquetball club.

985
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:51,819
Within a year,
Evan bought him out

986
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:54,561
and has been
ahead of him ever since.

987
00:44:54,604 --> 00:44:57,433
We met on a double-date.

988
00:44:57,477 --> 00:45:00,785
Does, um,
Patricia know?

989
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:02,264
The girl's
brain-damaged.

990
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:04,397
Flying around
at high altitudes.

991
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,530
Besides,
it's no big deal.

992
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:09,532
What about you?

993
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:11,578
I do what I want.

994
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:15,103
Nobody owns me.

995
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,541
Honey, don't
come on to me.

996
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:20,892
It gets in the way
of the work,

997
00:45:20,935 --> 00:45:23,024
and I don't want
any problems.

998
00:45:23,068 --> 00:45:24,591
Not that
you're not cute,

999
00:45:24,634 --> 00:45:26,158
not in your own way.

1000
00:45:26,201 --> 00:45:29,596
No, believe me,
it didn't even
enter my mind.

1001
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:31,729
Well, when it does, o.K.?

1002
00:45:33,078 --> 00:45:36,168
So do I pass
the audition?

1003
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:40,433
You made the call-backs.

1004
00:45:41,216 --> 00:45:44,002
It's a floor-through,
two blocks from
central park.

1005
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:47,396
Honey, you got to
see this place.

1006
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,528
Why won't you come?

1007
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:51,313
I want to.
I want to, but i...

1008
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:52,837
there are these videos.

1009
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,666
How long do you think
you'll want to stay
at my mother's

1010
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,277
when you get to New York?

1011
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,802
It sounds great!
It's just that
I can't right now.

1012
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:03,108
Oh, there's a cab!

1013
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:05,240
Honey, if you
like the place,

1014
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:07,068
see what
the deposit is.

1015
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:08,461
Taxi!

1016
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:10,593
It's right across
the street from
the planetarium.

1017
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:12,204
That's wonderful!
Wonderful!

1018
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:13,596
Love you. Get here!

1019
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,556
Bye-bye, honey.
I miss you!

1020
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:18,123
[Dial tone]

1021
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:20,603
I got to know
what I'm doing.

1022
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:22,692
My wife's waiting
for me in New York.

1023
00:46:22,736 --> 00:46:25,086
Marvin, after
our meeting with
George and Peggy,

1024
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:28,568
you can tell your wife
you'll be directing,
not teaching.

1025
00:46:28,611 --> 00:46:29,917
I think Peggy's
wonderful.

1026
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:32,485
Well, I need somebody
who can do more

1027
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:34,443
than sing
she's a sex goddess.

1028
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:36,445
George behaved nicer
than he did at canter's.

1029
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:40,667
He's impossible.
He'll want Peggy to have
the biggest part.

1030
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,191
He's in no position
to ask for shit

1031
00:46:43,235 --> 00:46:45,715
now that the horror
film's fallen apart.

1032
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,500
With the money
he'll fork over,

1033
00:46:47,543 --> 00:46:49,154
we can make the film
look like it should.

1034
00:46:49,197 --> 00:46:53,593
You know, this film
is about a guy's
involvement with his art.

1035
00:46:53,636 --> 00:46:55,725
How does he have time
for three women?

1036
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:58,467
You're absolutely right.
That's why I was thinking

1037
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:01,427
we ought to change him
into a gigolo.

1038
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:02,080
What?

1039
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:03,429
It's just
an idea.

1040
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:05,083
Did you hear
what he said?

1041
00:47:05,126 --> 00:47:08,390
You're the director.
We're pulling over.
The car's overheating.

1042
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:10,218
It was just a thought.

1043
00:47:10,262 --> 00:47:11,567
Come on, stop it.

1044
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:15,397
I don't want
to hear anymore.
I'm tuning you out.

1045
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:18,574
Come on.
We're a team.

1046
00:47:21,447 --> 00:47:23,666
I'm going to piss.

1047
00:47:24,493 --> 00:47:29,020
Let's just go
with the other guys
and get the deal signed.

1048
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:31,587
If Stuart's
turning the painter
into a photographer,

1049
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:34,634
won't you need
a bigger budget
for models and stuff?

1050
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:38,768
He wants to turn him
into a gigolo,
not a photographer.

1051
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:42,468
It's just an idea.
Can't I even tell
an idea?

1052
00:47:42,511 --> 00:47:43,991
I'll go scout
up ahead.

1053
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:46,428
Are you seriously
considering turning
him into a gigolo,

1054
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:48,778
or are you just
out of your mind?

1055
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:51,607
To hell with you.
You can write it
yourself.

1056
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:54,654
Where are you going?
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

1057
00:47:54,697 --> 00:47:58,701
Fuck you. You've got
such great ideas,
you rewrite the script.

1058
00:47:58,745 --> 00:48:02,531
You're the guy who knows
how to bullshit these guys.

1059
00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:03,924
Why are you so upset?

1060
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:06,405
I love her.
Marvin, I love her.

1061
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:10,452
It's eating me up inside,
I love her so much.

1062
00:48:10,496 --> 00:48:11,627
Who? What?

1063
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:14,239
Peggy!
For god's sake...Peggy!

1064
00:48:14,282 --> 00:48:15,718
Are you crazy?

1065
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:17,503
When
did this happen?

1066
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:20,549
I amcrazy...an idiot
who stabs himself
like a scorpion.

1067
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:22,551
I adore her.
I don't know
what to do.

1068
00:48:22,595 --> 00:48:25,598
Do you realize
what'll happen
if George finds out?

1069
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:28,993
Can't you think
of anything but yourself?

1070
00:48:29,036 --> 00:48:30,690
Can't you?

1071
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:32,866
I like him.

1072
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,259
He's really sweet,

1073
00:48:34,302 --> 00:48:37,088
and he's
crazy about me.

1074
00:48:37,436 --> 00:48:40,874
But if George
found out that
I saw him alone,

1075
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,223
it would kill him.

1076
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:44,182
I owe everything
to George.

1077
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:45,966
He saved my life.

1078
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:49,578
I owe him
everything for that.

1079
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,410
Maybe we could meet
at your place.

1080
00:48:55,845 --> 00:48:57,282
What?

1081
00:48:57,325 --> 00:49:00,198
George trusts me
with you. He doesn't
think you like me.

1082
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:01,590
This is
insignificant.

1083
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:03,766
Not for me!
The guy's allowed
to look presentable!

1084
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:07,031
How am I supposed
to shoot this
with one bulb?

1085
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:08,641
Mr. Bertolucci,
I goofed. I'm sorry.

1086
00:49:08,684 --> 00:49:11,949
This is a business.
I got to run
this fuckin' place,

1087
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:15,474
and you're going off
on one god damn
light bulb!

1088
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:16,562
You're out
of perspective.

1089
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:18,520
Darling, I love you.
Calm down.

1090
00:49:18,564 --> 00:49:21,175
You're a great artist.
You're very thorough.

1091
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:23,047
Please. We got
to finish this.

1092
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,484
Got eating disorders
in the hallway.

1093
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:27,007
You waiting for me?

1094
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:28,139
No. Marvin.

1095
00:49:28,182 --> 00:49:29,531
Right.

1096
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:32,926
Hey, kiddo, this
is not a bad life.

1097
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,449
What's the matter?

1098
00:49:34,493 --> 00:49:35,668
Nothing's the matter.

1099
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:38,540
Must I always be
an emissary of gloom?

1100
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:40,238
Something's wrong,
right? What?

1101
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:41,543
No. Everything
is perfect.

1102
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:45,069
As a matter
of fact, we got
to start thinking

1103
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:47,027
about getting
a production office.

1104
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:49,856
Now, there is this
thing with carmine...

1105
00:49:49,899 --> 00:49:51,379
you see? I knew it!

1106
00:49:51,423 --> 00:49:52,859
Thank god I didn't
tell Rachel!

1107
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:56,515
It's no big deal.
His father has to
cosign the check,

1108
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:58,647
so you'll pitch him
the story or something.

1109
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:01,737
Interesting guy. Used to be
the garbage king of Newark.

1110
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:02,738
She's beautiful.

1111
00:50:02,782 --> 00:50:04,827
She...she seems
to lift his spirits.

1112
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:08,048
And
as he paints her,
he photographs her.

1113
00:50:08,092 --> 00:50:11,051
It...it causes him
to be uplifted.

1114
00:50:11,095 --> 00:50:11,791
He's, uh...

1115
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:13,706
and as he...
his...he...

1116
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:15,055
his paintings
become...

1117
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:17,536
pictures become
further well-known,

1118
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:18,711
uh...[chuckles]

1119
00:50:18,754 --> 00:50:20,930
He's a wild
and crazy
but wonderful guy.

1120
00:50:20,974 --> 00:50:22,280
People love him.

1121
00:50:22,323 --> 00:50:23,672
He's like
Jack Nicholson

1122
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:26,501
in terms
of endearment...

1123
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:28,199
But nicer.

1124
00:50:38,948 --> 00:50:39,775
Aah!

1125
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:41,342
Who is it?

1126
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:42,126
Me...Marvin.

1127
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:43,518
Thank god
it's only you.

1128
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:46,565
Let me in. I've got
a bunch of groceries.

1129
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:47,653
I got to
get dressed.

1130
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:50,743
Give US a second.
We'll be right out.

1131
00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:52,310
Cesar romero.

1132
00:50:52,353 --> 00:50:53,615
Jack.

1133
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:54,660
Ed asner.

1134
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:57,924
Dennis hopper.
Why not Dennis hopper?

1135
00:50:57,967 --> 00:51:00,622
He's hot. Money.

1136
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:01,928
Robert culp.

1137
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:04,235
Will you stop? They're
all too old for the part.

1138
00:51:04,278 --> 00:51:06,541
What about
for the gallery
owner?

1139
00:51:06,585 --> 00:51:07,803
I know.
He's perfect...

1140
00:51:07,847 --> 00:51:09,240
the singer
from motley crue.

1141
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:12,504
Stop, Stuart.
We need an actor.
Stay out of casting.

1142
00:51:12,547 --> 00:51:14,288
What about
Klaus Maria brandauer?

1143
00:51:14,332 --> 00:51:16,377
He'd be brilliant
as the painter.

1144
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:17,335
He'd love the script.

1145
00:51:17,378 --> 00:51:19,467
He's a foreigner.
We need a name

1146
00:51:19,511 --> 00:51:22,557
if we're going to get
a good distributor.

1147
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:23,993
He isa name!

1148
00:51:24,037 --> 00:51:25,821
You're short 2 bucks.

1149
00:51:25,865 --> 00:51:27,649
Greg louganis.

1150
00:51:27,693 --> 00:51:28,607
The diver?

1151
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,217
Yeah. He's got
a lot of presence.

1152
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:32,567
You're good
with actors. You'll
make him look great.

1153
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:35,918
Jack, did you
see mephisto?
Brandauer's the guy!

1154
00:51:35,962 --> 00:51:36,963
Ernest borgnine.

1155
00:51:37,006 --> 00:51:38,225
He's too old!

1156
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:40,184
No! He's right
there! Look!

1157
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:42,099
Stuart, get
a script, quick.

1158
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:43,274
He's still
too old.

1159
00:51:43,317 --> 00:51:45,232
He won
an academy award!

1160
00:51:45,276 --> 00:51:46,755
Jack, what
are you doing?

1161
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:48,540
Mr. Borgnine!
Ernest! Ernest!

1162
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:49,932
Jack!

1163
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:53,022
Mr. Borgnine!
I want to talk to you
for a second!

1164
00:51:53,066 --> 00:51:54,154
Can I talk...

1165
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:57,549
can I talk to you
for a second?

1166
00:51:57,592 --> 00:51:58,941
Ernest, please!

1167
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:00,421
Won't you even...

1168
00:52:00,465 --> 00:52:03,642
there's a really
great part in that!
Seriously!

1169
00:52:03,685 --> 00:52:04,599
Ernest, i...

1170
00:52:04,643 --> 00:52:07,428
what's your fax number?
We can...

1171
00:52:13,434 --> 00:52:16,176
Maybe he istoo old
for the part,

1172
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,658
but he's a hell
of an actor.

1173
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:29,058
[Noise inside]

1174
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:29,885
Oh, jeez.

1175
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:31,017
[Knocks on door]

1176
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,759
Come on, Stuart,
you're overdoing it.

1177
00:52:33,802 --> 00:52:35,500
Man, enough is enough.

1178
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:38,851
It's still my place,
you know?

1179
00:52:38,894 --> 00:52:40,548
Hurry up.

1180
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:42,115
Hi.

1181
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,464
Hello.

1182
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:48,252
Hi.

1183
00:52:48,643 --> 00:52:50,819
Rachel?

1184
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:52,473
What are you
doing here?

1185
00:52:52,517 --> 00:52:55,868
Well, I missed my
husband desperately...

1186
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:59,350
And the air fare
was a giveaway.

1187
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:00,699
So.

1188
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:02,353
[Chuckles]

1189
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:04,224
Well, what have you done
with your hair?

1190
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:09,186
Hey, this is how all
hip restaurateurs look.

1191
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:12,450
Wait till you see
my tattoo.

1192
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,151
Oh...

1193
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,154
Oh, so that's
what sex is like.
I almost forgot.

1194
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:26,464
You get it more often
when you're in
the same time zone.

1195
00:53:29,031 --> 00:53:30,424
What's this?

1196
00:53:30,468 --> 00:53:32,687
Oh, yeah. "The fun
has just begun."

1197
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:37,518
I wasn't at my best
when I gave you this,
was I?

1198
00:53:37,562 --> 00:53:38,954
No, not exactly.

1199
00:53:38,998 --> 00:53:40,826
You know...o.K.

1200
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:41,783
All right.

1201
00:53:41,827 --> 00:53:43,176
What? What?

1202
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,440
Here. Now, this
is sort of an idea
for the waiters.

1203
00:53:46,484 --> 00:53:49,443
Oh, wow. This
is sort of tacky.

1204
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:50,444
Tacky?

1205
00:53:50,488 --> 00:53:51,532
Get...

1206
00:53:51,576 --> 00:53:55,057
oh, how dare you call
la Dee da tacky?

1207
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:57,625
It's beyond tacky.

1208
00:53:57,669 --> 00:54:00,628
New yorkers love
to hate L.A., right?

1209
00:54:00,672 --> 00:54:03,065
Soon they can
satisfy their snobbery

1210
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:04,806
and their stomachs
simultaneously.

1211
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:07,156
Where? At la Dee da.

1212
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,288
Aha!

1213
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:09,811
Zanily decorated
with plastic palm trees

1214
00:54:09,855 --> 00:54:11,248
and a freeway mural,

1215
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:14,860
la Dee da is going
to be a delicious
cartoon version

1216
00:54:14,903 --> 00:54:16,862
of the big orange.

1217
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:19,517
From Turkey chili

1218
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,607
to the unusual
designer pizzas...

1219
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:26,654
the food is going
to be so much better
than it has to.

1220
00:54:26,698 --> 00:54:30,571
Opened by the young
and vivacious
Rachel landisman

1221
00:54:30,615 --> 00:54:32,617
and her partner
Paula Rose,

1222
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,272
la Dee da
is going to be

1223
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:37,448
New York's
new hot spot.

1224
00:54:37,491 --> 00:54:38,666
Yeah.

1225
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:41,278
Bring
your sunglasses.

1226
00:54:44,672 --> 00:54:46,718
Is that how
you pitch it?

1227
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:48,546
It depends who
I'm talking to,

1228
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:51,723
but I can
pour it on, yeah.

1229
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,900
You know what
would be really great?

1230
00:54:54,943 --> 00:54:57,119
If we could go
to robata's.

1231
00:54:57,163 --> 00:54:58,686
Robata's for dinner?

1232
00:54:58,730 --> 00:54:59,644
Yeah.

1233
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:00,645
Tonight?

1234
00:55:00,688 --> 00:55:01,776
Who can afford that?

1235
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,257
We can.
I bring great news.

1236
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,781
We are not going
to prison after all.

1237
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:13,484
I have paid off
the entire
American express.

1238
00:55:14,572 --> 00:55:16,095
Great.

1239
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:18,097
Great.

1240
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:21,927
We should've made
a reservation.

1241
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,495
Sure you don't want
to wait in the bar?

1242
00:55:24,538 --> 00:55:27,846
No. Let's
take a ride and
come back later.

1243
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:29,413
O.k.

1244
00:55:30,109 --> 00:55:31,415
Mr. Wright.
How are you?

1245
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:35,462
I don't know you.
You're making a mistake.

1246
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:37,682
Boys?

1247
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:39,553
Now, boys.

1248
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:41,120
I like
the food here.

1249
00:55:41,163 --> 00:55:42,948
It's nice
to see you.

1250
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:44,253
Who was that?

1251
00:55:44,297 --> 00:55:45,777
He was right.
My mistake.

1252
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:48,475
He looked like
somebody else.

1253
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:50,651
I'm glad
we're leaving L.A.

1254
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:53,567
I just feel
so much happier
in New York,

1255
00:55:53,611 --> 00:55:57,136
and...and we're
so much better
in that city.

1256
00:55:57,179 --> 00:55:57,963
Yeah.

1257
00:55:58,006 --> 00:55:59,617
This place,
I don't know,

1258
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,836
just...feels
like bad luck.

1259
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,709
But...oh, you learn
from everything...

1260
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:06,363
I guess.

1261
00:56:06,754 --> 00:56:09,540
Fred thinks
you'll get the job
at queens college,

1262
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:14,414
but you have to
fly there now and
talk to the chairman.

1263
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,677
It's a wonderful job.

1264
00:56:16,721 --> 00:56:18,897
I can't right now.
I promised Bernie.

1265
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,726
Yeah. I just
don't want you
to lose it...

1266
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:25,860
So maybe if you
came back with me
for two days.

1267
00:56:25,904 --> 00:56:27,601
Uh...there are
these videos.

1268
00:56:27,645 --> 00:56:31,170
I've...i got
to finish them.

1269
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:37,002
You're having an affair.

1270
00:56:37,045 --> 00:56:38,264
What?

1271
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:42,007
There are Bobby pins
all over the floor.

1272
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,574
Ahem.

1273
00:56:44,966 --> 00:56:46,446
No, I'm not. I'm...

1274
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:47,491
there are these people.

1275
00:56:47,534 --> 00:56:50,494
They're using my place
to rehearse.

1276
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:51,712
Marvin...

1277
00:56:51,756 --> 00:56:53,192
no. Uh...

1278
00:56:55,586 --> 00:56:58,676
Rachel, i...
I got to tell you
something. Um...

1279
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,112
You know
that crazy idea

1280
00:57:00,155 --> 00:57:02,897
that when you really
want something,
it won't happen,

1281
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:06,988
but when you
forget about it,
there it is?

1282
00:57:07,032 --> 00:57:07,902
It's true.

1283
00:57:07,946 --> 00:57:09,513
What do you mean?

1284
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:10,601
Guess.

1285
00:57:10,644 --> 00:57:11,863
I don't know.
Guess.

1286
00:57:11,906 --> 00:57:15,170
I don't know. I...
you won the lottery.

1287
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:18,652
The darkness
and the light.

1288
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:20,219
Oh.

1289
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:22,743
I said I had
to think about it.

1290
00:57:22,787 --> 00:57:24,484
It's so easy
this time.

1291
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:26,530
We're either
doing it or not.

1292
00:57:26,573 --> 00:57:28,096
I'm just waiting
to sign.

1293
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,622
That's why I didn't
tell you sooner.

1294
00:57:31,665 --> 00:57:33,711
See, these people
are quite reasonable.

1295
00:57:33,754 --> 00:57:36,801
They have constructive
criticism. We're making
it more modern.

1296
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:39,281
We're turning
the painter
into a photographer,

1297
00:57:39,325 --> 00:57:44,678
but I'm getting to
tell Warren's story,
suicide and all.

1298
00:57:47,855 --> 00:57:48,987
You know, I thought...

1299
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:52,251
If I set the last scene
in Michael's room

1300
00:57:52,294 --> 00:57:53,687
rather than
up on the roof,

1301
00:57:53,731 --> 00:57:58,431
maybe I can use
the real building
in the background.

1302
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,694
It'll be our secret.

1303
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:02,870
Zoey and David

1304
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:05,351
stand for a moment
in the center
of the room,

1305
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:10,530
not knowing
what they want or
why they came there.

1306
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:15,579
We cut to the frail,
human possessions
that inhabit the room.

1307
00:58:15,622 --> 00:58:18,712
A pair of shoes
near the bed.

1308
00:58:18,756 --> 00:58:21,585
A few pennies
on the kitchen table.

1309
00:58:21,628 --> 00:58:26,807
They turn to look
at the photographs
that line the walls.

1310
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:29,941
Pictures that glow
with the marvelous radiance

1311
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:34,119
from the passion
that burned within him.

1312
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:38,819
There should be something
almost embarrassing

1313
00:58:38,863 --> 00:58:42,954
about the beauty
and intimacy of them.

1314
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,610
Suddenly David...

1315
00:58:46,653 --> 00:58:49,656
Is drawn
toward the balcony...

1316
00:58:52,877 --> 00:58:56,184
Trying to confront...

1317
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,709
The reality
of the leap.

1318
00:58:58,752 --> 00:59:00,145
The insanity of it.

1319
00:59:00,188 --> 00:59:04,018
And as he looks down
to the streets
of the city below,

1320
00:59:04,062 --> 00:59:08,588
he understands
what it's like to want
something so much

1321
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:11,722
that it can destroy you.

1322
00:59:11,765 --> 00:59:14,376
The emotion's
so strong that they...

1323
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,900
they push it
or reach out

1324
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:19,556
beyond everything that
holds you to the earth.

1325
00:59:22,428 --> 00:59:23,821
Marvin.

1326
00:59:28,956 --> 00:59:31,176
You're an asshole.

1327
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:34,309
All you ever think of
is you, you, you!

1328
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:38,226
You never believed
in me! You're just
like my father!

1329
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:39,576
Oh!

1330
00:59:39,924 --> 00:59:42,622
Because he had
such a shitty time
in Russia,

1331
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:45,712
he thinks no one
could have any luck
anywhere!

1332
00:59:45,756 --> 00:59:48,062
I said, "pop, you're
in america now!"

1333
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:50,630
Rachel, you're
the asshole!

1334
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,202
Marvin, don't be
self-destructive.

1335
00:59:57,245 --> 01:00:01,641
The seven years
that we tried
to make that film

1336
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:03,338
were like
a horrible accident.

1337
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:07,125
We're just now starting
to pick up the pieces.

1338
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:11,172
I'm happy for
the first time in years.

1339
01:00:11,216 --> 01:00:12,609
Marvin...

1340
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:18,005
Please don't take that
away from me.

1341
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:20,094
Please.

1342
01:00:20,138 --> 01:00:22,401
Don't.

1343
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:25,404
Oh. Please.

1344
01:00:25,447 --> 01:00:27,841
Please don't.

1345
01:00:28,146 --> 01:00:29,408
It was terrible.

1346
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:35,849
Sometimes I didn't know
if I loved you anymore.

1347
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:38,504
Oh, god,
you're right.

1348
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:39,810
You're right.

1349
01:00:39,853 --> 01:00:42,987
Please don't
scare me again.

1350
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:44,423
Please.

1351
01:00:44,466 --> 01:00:47,687
Forget about the film.
It's crazy.

1352
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:49,167
It's not crazy, honey.

1353
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:50,298
It's not crazy.

1354
01:00:50,342 --> 01:00:52,866
Your film could
have been beautiful,

1355
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:56,740
but no one
wants to see it.

1356
01:01:00,395 --> 01:01:02,180
How can you say that?

1357
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:06,097
No one's ever had
a chance to see it.

1358
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,446
You're right.

1359
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:09,230
You're
absolutely right.

1360
01:01:09,274 --> 01:01:10,405
They should see it.

1361
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:12,016
They should see it.

1362
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:13,234
But to the
money people,

1363
01:01:13,278 --> 01:01:16,890
a film about
a frail artist
and his death,

1364
01:01:16,934 --> 01:01:18,109
that's a joke.

1365
01:01:18,152 --> 01:01:20,067
To them, Warren's
just some loser

1366
01:01:20,111 --> 01:01:22,243
who deserved
what he got.

1367
01:01:22,287 --> 01:01:23,592
You're right, honey,

1368
01:01:23,636 --> 01:01:25,769
but there's nothing
we can do.

1369
01:01:25,812 --> 01:01:26,987
That's the bottom line.

1370
01:01:27,031 --> 01:01:29,381
I'm sorry. I've got
to get something to eat.

1371
01:01:29,424 --> 01:01:32,036
When a spirit
like Warren's
is squelched,

1372
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,516
the world loses
something great.

1373
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,779
You know that.

1374
01:01:35,822 --> 01:01:38,477
Yes, Marvin.
We know that.

1375
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,000
They don't care.

1376
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:42,350
What...what is this?

1377
01:01:42,394 --> 01:01:43,612
I care.

1378
01:01:43,656 --> 01:01:45,136
Marvin, you were
the last thing

1379
01:01:45,179 --> 01:01:48,530
that Warren
couldn't cope with
before he jumped.

1380
01:01:48,574 --> 01:01:50,837
What you care about
is your guilt.

1381
01:01:50,881 --> 01:01:54,101
Can you clean out
the refrigerator
once in a while?

1382
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:58,105
Should I make a film
about something
I don't care about?

1383
01:01:58,149 --> 01:01:59,019
Car racing?

1384
01:01:59,063 --> 01:02:00,499
Your film
is about a man

1385
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:03,937
who didn't have
an inch of talent
for living,

1386
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:05,678
so he solves
all his problems

1387
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,636
by throwing himself
off of a roof.

1388
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,248
You didn't used to
see it that way.

1389
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:13,860
But now that
you can pay off
American express,

1390
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:15,601
that's
how you see it.

1391
01:02:15,644 --> 01:02:17,995
Yeah, 'cause i'm
a sellout, right?

1392
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:19,213
I'm a big sellout.

1393
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:22,260
And you're...
Everything you do
is right.

1394
01:02:22,303 --> 01:02:24,218
This is the real world.

1395
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:26,917
Birds in paintings
don't fly away.

1396
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,005
They just stay there.

1397
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:31,182
Don't you dare
make fun of that!

1398
01:02:31,225 --> 01:02:32,313
I'm not.

1399
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:33,750
That's the thing.

1400
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,577
I don't think
you understand

1401
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:37,318
that birds
in paintings
don't fly.

1402
01:02:37,362 --> 01:02:40,104
People can't
have everything
that they want.

1403
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:41,366
They can't have that.

1404
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:44,151
You have to
stop dreaming.

1405
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,197
You are such
a talented man,

1406
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,679
and you don't have
a single thing
to show for it.

1407
01:02:50,723 --> 01:02:52,551
You live like
a hermit,

1408
01:02:52,594 --> 01:02:54,074
my brother
is your only friend,

1409
01:02:54,118 --> 01:02:57,425
you make videotapes
for some jerk
that you hate.

1410
01:02:57,469 --> 01:03:00,646
You live like
a college kid, Marvin.

1411
01:03:00,689 --> 01:03:03,736
I...i...i can't
believe it.

1412
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:14,703
Well...

1413
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:18,011
But I am going
to make this film.

1414
01:03:18,055 --> 01:03:20,100
Fine.

1415
01:03:23,408 --> 01:03:25,279
That's fine.

1416
01:03:28,282 --> 01:03:32,156
But you're going
to do it without me.

1417
01:03:47,388 --> 01:03:49,216
You're right.

1418
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,609
The real mistake is

1419
01:03:50,652 --> 01:03:53,742
I didn't let you
go earlier.

1420
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:05,232
What are you saying?

1421
01:04:07,452 --> 01:04:09,236
I want you to go.

1422
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,239
There's no way
I'll ever beat this.

1423
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:14,198
It's what
I am, honey.

1424
01:04:14,241 --> 01:04:17,679
What else
am I here for?

1425
01:04:24,643 --> 01:04:26,645
Well, maybe...

1426
01:04:26,688 --> 01:04:29,604
If you...if you really
thought that...

1427
01:04:29,648 --> 01:04:30,867
don't give in.

1428
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:32,999
I mean,
who are we kidding?

1429
01:04:33,043 --> 01:04:36,437
This may not
come together,
and if it doesn't,

1430
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:41,268
I don't want you
to be around me
this time.

1431
01:04:41,312 --> 01:04:43,009
I love you.

1432
01:04:43,053 --> 01:04:47,666
I want you happy
and far away.

1433
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:14,911
Please let me take you
to the airport.

1434
01:05:16,129 --> 01:05:17,783
[Engine starts]

1435
01:05:17,826 --> 01:05:19,306
No.

1436
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:37,237
Ah!

1437
01:05:44,897 --> 01:05:46,768
Dah!

1438
01:05:57,823 --> 01:05:59,346
Ah!

1439
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:51,094
Marvin, Marvin, Marvin.

1440
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:52,486
You're killing me,
Marvin.

1441
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:54,227
You're killing me,
Marvin.

1442
01:06:54,271 --> 01:06:55,272
Just do it.

1443
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:58,231
This is not the script
we agreed to.

1444
01:06:58,275 --> 01:06:59,928
Just do it!

1445
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:00,668
O.k., o.K.

1446
01:07:00,712 --> 01:07:02,670
Life is
too beautiful.

1447
01:07:02,714 --> 01:07:06,500
There's always
another day.

1448
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:10,722
Is that good?

1449
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:12,593
Keep it rolling.

1450
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:14,204
What are you doing?

1451
01:07:14,247 --> 01:07:15,901
Rolling.

1452
01:07:17,207 --> 01:07:20,166
Just do what
I tell you to do.

1453
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,386
Get back to one.

1454
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,128
Back to one.

1455
01:07:26,564 --> 01:07:28,131
250 feet, chief.

1456
01:07:28,174 --> 01:07:30,263
In six. Action.

1457
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:35,268
Life is so beautiful.

1458
01:07:36,269 --> 01:07:39,055
There's always
another day.

1459
01:07:46,236 --> 01:07:48,107
Good for you?

1460
01:07:48,499 --> 01:07:52,024
Oh, my god!Aah!No!

1461
01:08:14,655 --> 01:08:16,396
Basically,
I'm playing
with the idea

1462
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:20,270
that there's
like, a happening
in the universe.

1463
01:08:20,313 --> 01:08:22,141
The story focuses
on four people

1464
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:24,230
who live near
one another.

1465
01:08:24,274 --> 01:08:26,276
Now, because
of this energy thing,

1466
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,147
one of them
is destined to die.

1467
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:29,714
It could be Peggy

1468
01:08:29,757 --> 01:08:32,108
who's so sensual
and lovely.

1469
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:35,241
Or maybe Patricia
who's light-hearted
and funny.

1470
01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:38,505
But the main suspicion
falls on Beverly

1471
01:08:38,549 --> 01:08:39,637
who is so dramatic

1472
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,161
that you
have to wonder
about her past.

1473
01:08:42,205 --> 01:08:44,120
Certainly
not the photographer

1474
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:47,862
who seems so normal
and successful that...

1475
01:08:47,906 --> 01:08:48,950
That's it.

1476
01:08:48,994 --> 01:08:51,127
I'm going back to
the original script.

1477
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:53,259
I'm not making
any changes.

1478
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:54,739
Any changes.

1479
01:08:54,782 --> 01:08:58,090
Marvin. What are you
talking about?

1480
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,006
They won't make
the film.

1481
01:09:01,267 --> 01:09:04,183
Don't be
self-destructive.

1482
01:09:13,845 --> 01:09:16,152
Help me, Stuart.

1483
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,329
Help me, will you?

1484
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:22,201
You're a smart guy.

1485
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:23,333
It's a great story.

1486
01:09:23,376 --> 01:09:27,641
Just help me
use these women
to tell it

1487
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:28,860
and get it made.

1488
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:31,863
I never told you
what this all
came out of.

1489
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:35,171
It's about that actor
committing suicide
on your film.

1490
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:38,304
No. It's about
how I killed him.

1491
01:09:38,348 --> 01:09:40,698
What?

1492
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:45,703
Believe it or not,
Stuart,

1493
01:09:45,746 --> 01:09:47,183
once
I was pretty hot.

1494
01:09:47,226 --> 01:09:49,968
From an old novel,
I wrote a script

1495
01:09:50,011 --> 01:09:51,230
about a ruthless
gambler

1496
01:09:51,274 --> 01:09:53,450
who destroys
someone he loves.

1497
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:54,755
Life changes for him,

1498
01:09:54,799 --> 01:09:57,236
and then,
isolated and desperate,

1499
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:01,936
he realizes who he is
and kills himself.

1500
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:05,157
Pretty grim stuff,
but...

1501
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,725
I got Warren zell.

1502
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:12,556
Warren was a very
special actor.

1503
01:10:12,599 --> 01:10:14,122
He was an original.

1504
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,212
But he'd been
through a lot,

1505
01:10:16,255 --> 01:10:18,214
and he wasn't
acting anymore.

1506
01:10:18,257 --> 01:10:21,956
See, I had been
his student.

1507
01:10:23,654 --> 01:10:26,483
He trusted
and liked me...

1508
01:10:26,526 --> 01:10:27,788
And I convinced him

1509
01:10:27,832 --> 01:10:33,185
it would give what
he had been through
meaning.

1510
01:10:36,536 --> 01:10:39,104
Warren was amazing.

1511
01:10:39,974 --> 01:10:43,326
The film
suddenly had a...

1512
01:10:43,369 --> 01:10:46,242
Incredible mystery
to it.

1513
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:52,683
Actually,
it was too good.

1514
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:55,120
The producers
loved the rushes

1515
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:58,254
and thought
it might be
a Christmas release.

1516
01:10:58,297 --> 01:11:00,647
Oh, they had
one small change...

1517
01:11:00,691 --> 01:11:02,910
take out the suicide.

1518
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:05,783
Instead,
have the character
recite some speech

1519
01:11:05,826 --> 01:11:09,787
like, "there's
always another day."

1520
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:15,967
It was, um...4:00
in the afternoon.

1521
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,928
I had a terrible
headache.

1522
01:11:23,931 --> 01:11:26,978
I can still
hear the thud.

1523
01:11:28,196 --> 01:11:30,111
God, that's sick.

1524
01:11:30,155 --> 01:11:31,461
He was crazy.

1525
01:11:31,504 --> 01:11:35,073
Of course he was,
or he wouldn't
have jumped.

1526
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:39,120
But he was
too weak to fight US
any other way.

1527
01:11:39,164 --> 01:11:42,080
He had to remain
honest to himself,

1528
01:11:42,123 --> 01:11:44,256
and the suffering
he represented.

1529
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:49,000
I was betraying him,
turning this into
an insane farce.

1530
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:50,175
Don't you see,
Stuart?

1531
01:11:50,218 --> 01:11:53,526
This
is what the film
needs to be about...

1532
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:56,355
the fact that
not everything
is for sale,

1533
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:00,359
that some things
just have to be
left as they are.

1534
01:12:00,403 --> 01:12:02,361
Help me, Stuart.

1535
01:12:02,405 --> 01:12:05,712
I want his death
to mean something.

1536
01:12:05,756 --> 01:12:06,887
Marvin,

1537
01:12:06,931 --> 01:12:08,324
they're
only making this

1538
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:11,283
to put their
girlfriends in it.

1539
01:12:27,821 --> 01:12:29,170
Take out the painter.

1540
01:12:29,214 --> 01:12:32,348
He's a photographer.
We can't take him out.

1541
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:35,742
The whole thing
revolves around him!

1542
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:39,659
O.k. Leave him in,

1543
01:12:39,703 --> 01:12:42,140
but take out
the suicide.

1544
01:12:42,183 --> 01:12:43,446
What, are you crazy?

1545
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:45,273
After the trouble
we went through
to sell it?

1546
01:12:45,317 --> 01:12:47,406
That's the only element
everyone agrees on.

1547
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:50,409
I can't bear him dying
amidst all this crap.

1548
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:52,803
Let him get hit
by a car, leave town...

1549
01:12:52,846 --> 01:12:56,807
it's a little late
for that. Marvin,
the suicide stays.

1550
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:57,982
You take it out.

1551
01:12:58,025 --> 01:13:00,245
I won't have him
turn into
a comic book.

1552
01:13:00,288 --> 01:13:02,203
I won't
murder him again!

1553
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:04,162
I'll kill you.

1554
01:13:04,205 --> 01:13:05,555
Don't take it
so personally!

1555
01:13:05,598 --> 01:13:09,733
You're going
to murder him.
I'm going to kill you!

1556
01:13:09,776 --> 01:13:10,995
Hold it!

1557
01:13:11,038 --> 01:13:12,736
[Trigger is cocked]

1558
01:13:14,694 --> 01:13:17,175
Sorry, dad.

1559
01:13:17,523 --> 01:13:20,308
I don't know where
junior gets the idea

1560
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:23,529
that the writing game
is some fucking picnic.

1561
01:13:23,573 --> 01:13:24,791
As far as I know,

1562
01:13:24,835 --> 01:13:28,142
you not only need
gracious amounts of talent,

1563
01:13:28,186 --> 01:13:30,623
but balls of steel.

1564
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,412
If I never wrote again,

1565
01:13:36,455 --> 01:13:40,503
it would be
too soon for me.

1566
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:46,683
I remember 1962
in the high sierras.

1567
01:13:46,726 --> 01:13:50,643
I almost shot
peckinpah's big toe off

1568
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:55,387
'cause he wanted
to cut a scene of mine.

1569
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,521
That's when I gave a shit.

1570
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:00,871
You want a drink?

1571
01:14:03,134 --> 01:14:06,137
We were hunting bear.

1572
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,791
Bear.

1573
01:14:08,705 --> 01:14:10,837
That's real.

1574
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:17,844
Junior, go down and
get US some ice, will you?

1575
01:14:21,326 --> 01:14:24,155
Let me give you
some advice, landisman.

1576
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:27,071
I don't know what's
going on with junior

1577
01:14:27,114 --> 01:14:28,464
and this screenwriting.

1578
01:14:28,507 --> 01:14:31,031
Probably some phase he's
going through or something.

1579
01:14:31,075 --> 01:14:34,208
But you're a little
long in the tooth

1580
01:14:34,252 --> 01:14:38,561
to be playing the auteur
game, don't you think?

1581
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:42,086
There's a weird kind
of respect that you get

1582
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:44,044
for making anything...

1583
01:14:44,088 --> 01:14:46,482
Even a piece of shit.

1584
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:50,050
You're in the club.

1585
01:14:50,094 --> 01:14:51,835
From where I'm sitting,

1586
01:14:51,878 --> 01:14:56,187
that looks like
what you need.

1587
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:57,797
[Sighs]

1588
01:14:57,841 --> 01:15:01,758
It's all
a fucking charade, anyway.

1589
01:16:29,759 --> 01:16:32,196
[Giggling]

1590
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:37,680
[Coughing]

1591
01:17:04,315 --> 01:17:06,970
[Rachel]
Marvin?

1592
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:12,671
What about
my two points?

1593
01:17:12,715 --> 01:17:14,325
Will they
give in on them?

1594
01:17:14,368 --> 01:17:17,371
They won't take any points
from their share.

1595
01:17:17,415 --> 01:17:18,938
I fought
like crazy for it.

1596
01:17:18,982 --> 01:17:23,203
Why don't we each
give Stuart a point
from our share?

1597
01:17:23,247 --> 01:17:25,205
Stuart,
you've been very helpful,

1598
01:17:25,249 --> 01:17:26,554
but a point is a point.

1599
01:17:26,598 --> 01:17:29,209
Then pay cash.
I'm killing myself
on this script.

1600
01:17:29,253 --> 01:17:31,211
It's supposed to
come from them.

1601
01:17:31,255 --> 01:17:32,125
Jack.

1602
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:33,692
All right.
You got the points.

1603
01:17:33,736 --> 01:17:37,391
If he's willing
to give up one of his,

1604
01:17:37,435 --> 01:17:38,175
why not?

1605
01:17:38,218 --> 01:17:39,829
God knows you deserve it.

1606
01:17:39,872 --> 01:17:41,918
Fine. That's it.
Everything agreed?

1607
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:43,920
Yeah.
I'll take care of it.

1608
01:17:43,963 --> 01:17:45,661
I got to draw up
those papers

1609
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:48,098
because George
is throwing a party tomorrow

1610
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:50,535
for Peggy's voice teacher,
and everybody's invited.

1611
01:17:50,578 --> 01:17:53,930
He thinks it's a good time
to sign the contracts.

1612
01:17:53,973 --> 01:17:55,671
Will the script
be finished?

1613
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:56,584
I think so.

1614
01:17:56,628 --> 01:17:58,369
Come on, guys.
Let's celebrate.

1615
01:17:58,412 --> 01:18:00,676
Are you still
doing that comic
thing?

1616
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:01,502
No, but...

1617
01:18:01,546 --> 01:18:04,331
don't tell me.
Just finish.

1618
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:06,682
You know, Marvin,

1619
01:18:06,725 --> 01:18:08,335
when this picture
hits the theaters,

1620
01:18:08,379 --> 01:18:11,208
the only thing
we'll have to worry about

1621
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:13,732
is what floor
of the black tower

1622
01:18:13,776 --> 01:18:16,387
we're going to piss out of.

1623
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:20,304
From your mouth
to god's ears.

1624
01:18:20,347 --> 01:18:22,436
I'm telling you.

1625
01:18:23,089 --> 01:18:26,223
So what the fuck
happened to you, Jack?

1626
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:29,748
You used to be
a big shot at universal.

1627
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:33,360
Why are you
cocking around
with deals like this?

1628
01:18:33,404 --> 01:18:34,666
Yeah, well.

1629
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,669
You know, I loved
working at the studios.

1630
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,498
I'm not one of those guys
who knocks them.

1631
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:44,197
It was
Fritz benings.
He screwed him.

1632
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:45,633
No. Bullshit.

1633
01:18:45,677 --> 01:18:48,375
I screwed myself.

1634
01:18:48,419 --> 01:18:49,812
Oh, god.

1635
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:52,858
Benings was the head
of the studio

1636
01:18:52,902 --> 01:18:55,295
when I did
the stradler picture.

1637
01:18:55,339 --> 01:18:56,296
Classic asshole.

1638
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:58,124
I had to fight him
for everything.

1639
01:18:58,168 --> 01:19:00,518
I had to fight him
for...The budget,

1640
01:19:00,561 --> 01:19:01,780
the stars, the director,

1641
01:19:01,824 --> 01:19:05,218
but despite him, I got
the picture made my way.

1642
01:19:05,262 --> 01:19:07,830
It's the best damn thing
I ever did.

1643
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:12,312
Then when it looked like
it was going to go big,

1644
01:19:12,356 --> 01:19:13,618
he suddenly decides

1645
01:19:13,661 --> 01:19:17,100
he wants his name on
the picture as co-producer.

1646
01:19:17,143 --> 01:19:20,059
I should have given it
to the prick, but...

1647
01:19:20,103 --> 01:19:25,151
This old street thing came up,
and I had to fuck him.

1648
01:19:25,195 --> 01:19:26,849
I mean, if it had hit,

1649
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:30,200
I would have
gotten away with it.

1650
01:19:30,243 --> 01:19:31,767
But...

1651
01:19:32,855 --> 01:19:34,813
It bombed.

1652
01:19:34,857 --> 01:19:38,338
Then I was
just another loudmouth.

1653
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:42,647
Haven't worked
for a studio since.

1654
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:46,346
For 15 years,
I've done nothing.

1655
01:19:48,435 --> 01:19:50,611
What a jerk I was.

1656
01:19:50,655 --> 01:19:53,266
You did that
scuba diver film.

1657
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:55,268
That piece of shit?

1658
01:19:55,312 --> 01:19:59,490
Now I got to crawl around
on my hands and knees

1659
01:19:59,533 --> 01:20:02,580
to get a couple of bucks
for something.

1660
01:20:02,623 --> 01:20:06,366
Jesus,
I did it to myself.

1661
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:09,108
Now I look back...

1662
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:13,504
All those years
have disappeared

1663
01:20:13,547 --> 01:20:17,421
like a coin
sinking in the sand.

1664
01:20:21,512 --> 01:20:24,820
This life...This one life.

1665
01:20:31,609 --> 01:20:32,610
Jack...

1666
01:20:32,653 --> 01:20:36,309
This film will be
a new beginning...

1667
01:20:38,398 --> 01:20:40,879
For all of US.

1668
01:20:40,923 --> 01:20:44,100
To new beginnings.

1669
01:20:50,323 --> 01:20:53,283
To new beginnings.

1670
01:20:56,634 --> 01:20:58,984
Did you just
get off the boat,
buddy?

1671
01:20:59,028 --> 01:21:01,421
I'm telling you,
I'm the producer,
Jack roth.

1672
01:21:01,465 --> 01:21:03,467
They don't
have our names.

1673
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:05,382
You have Stuart stratland?

1674
01:21:05,425 --> 01:21:06,470
Stratland...

1675
01:21:06,513 --> 01:21:08,428
Yep. Stratland
and two guests.

1676
01:21:08,472 --> 01:21:11,867
All right.
You can go on up.

1677
01:21:12,911 --> 01:21:14,478
I know teak, ebony.

1678
01:21:14,521 --> 01:21:16,741
I'm an expert on wood.

1679
01:21:16,784 --> 01:21:19,178
I love trees.

1680
01:21:19,222 --> 01:21:20,266
Oh!

1681
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:21,354
Oh, what a dilemma

1682
01:21:21,398 --> 01:21:24,488
to be torn between
two gorgeous women.

1683
01:21:24,531 --> 01:21:26,229
Oh, Jack.

1684
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,447
Believe it or not,

1685
01:21:27,491 --> 01:21:31,190
this little fella
is a genuine hans broker.

1686
01:21:31,234 --> 01:21:32,278
No, don't touch it.

1687
01:21:32,322 --> 01:21:34,193
It's over
200 years old.

1688
01:21:34,237 --> 01:21:35,891
The mechanism
is more precise

1689
01:21:35,934 --> 01:21:38,371
than anything
the Japanese
ever thought of.

1690
01:21:38,415 --> 01:21:41,374
Never loses a second.
That's something, huh?

1691
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:43,507
I'd like to see
the cuckoo.

1692
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:46,075
When does it
come out?

1693
01:21:46,118 --> 01:21:48,294
It's broken.

1694
01:21:48,338 --> 01:21:51,776
Nobody knows how
to fix the cuckoo.

1695
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,085
You know,
Mitch has taught
everyone.

1696
01:21:56,128 --> 01:22:00,089
Just this morning,
Liza sent him
a bowl of flowers.

1697
01:22:00,132 --> 01:22:01,917
George and I
are so lucky

1698
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,049
to have him living
here with US.

1699
01:22:04,093 --> 01:22:06,312
I adore
talented people.

1700
01:22:07,009 --> 01:22:09,272
You put a scratch
on this,

1701
01:22:09,315 --> 01:22:11,491
it'll be your ass.

1702
01:22:13,363 --> 01:22:15,669
I used to drink.

1703
01:22:16,627 --> 01:22:18,237
Oh, I forgot the dip!

1704
01:22:18,281 --> 01:22:20,587
Watermelon and jalapeño.

1705
01:22:20,631 --> 01:22:21,849
I'll help.

1706
01:22:21,893 --> 01:22:23,460
After all, we're going
to be working together.

1707
01:22:23,503 --> 01:22:25,288
You are
such a sweetie.

1708
01:22:25,331 --> 01:22:28,726
I can tell
we're going to be buds.

1709
01:22:28,769 --> 01:22:29,857
I'll help, too.

1710
01:22:29,901 --> 01:22:33,339
Uh, no, thank you.
It's girls' work.

1711
01:22:33,383 --> 01:22:35,515
What a tacky party.

1712
01:22:35,559 --> 01:22:37,387
What a
terrific party.

1713
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:38,431
Have a burger.

1714
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:40,085
I will.
I've heard about

1715
01:22:40,129 --> 01:22:41,391
your famous
barbecue sauce.

1716
01:22:41,434 --> 01:22:43,828
It's not the sauce.
My herbs make it delicious.

1717
01:22:43,871 --> 01:22:47,310
So westmoreland asks
all the officers
in the room

1718
01:22:47,353 --> 01:22:48,789
if they have
any questions,

1719
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:51,792
and I said, "yeah,
I got a fucking
question, general."

1720
01:22:51,836 --> 01:22:52,750
Where's Evan?

1721
01:22:52,793 --> 01:22:54,882
He's flying in
from Europe.

1722
01:22:54,926 --> 01:22:56,362
How's the script?

1723
01:22:56,406 --> 01:22:57,624
Europe?

1724
01:22:57,668 --> 01:23:00,236
Don't worry.
He's got to be
in Tokyo tomorrow.

1725
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:01,802
But what if...

1726
01:23:01,846 --> 01:23:03,282
oh!

1727
01:23:03,326 --> 01:23:04,240
Oh!

1728
01:23:04,283 --> 01:23:05,284
Oh, no, don't worry.

1729
01:23:05,328 --> 01:23:07,330
No, no, don't worry.
Don't worry.

1730
01:23:07,373 --> 01:23:10,724
Most watermelon
will come right out.

1731
01:23:10,768 --> 01:23:12,248
Oh, hi, Beverly.

1732
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:13,162
Hi.

1733
01:23:13,205 --> 01:23:14,598
Beverly,
this is Peggy.

1734
01:23:14,641 --> 01:23:17,731
Peggy,
this is Beverly.

1735
01:23:17,775 --> 01:23:19,168
Hello.

1736
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:22,171
Marvin,
she's really pretty.
I mean, really gorgeous.

1737
01:23:22,214 --> 01:23:24,782
Boy, I can't wait
to work together.

1738
01:23:24,825 --> 01:23:26,740
This is going
to be great.

1739
01:23:26,784 --> 01:23:30,222
You've got dip
in your hair.

1740
01:23:30,266 --> 01:23:34,270
You know, I think
I'm going to go change.

1741
01:23:35,358 --> 01:23:37,534
You'd better be
a good director

1742
01:23:37,577 --> 01:23:38,796
with those two
yo-yos.

1743
01:23:38,839 --> 01:23:41,494
George, Peggy wants to
bring the guests inside.

1744
01:23:41,538 --> 01:23:44,149
We're bringing out
a birthday cake for Mitch.

1745
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:46,021
Thank you.
Everybody
in the house!

1746
01:23:46,064 --> 01:23:49,154
You want to come inside
for some birthday cake?

1747

You don't know horrible.

The tiles?
The tiles
in the bathroom

1749
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,291
are from Macedonia.

1750
01:23:55,334 --> 01:23:56,292
Where's Macedonia?

1751

01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:59,338
George
has detectives
everywhere tonight.

1753
01:23:59,382 --> 01:24:01,384
He thinks
I'm having an affair

1754
01:24:01,427 --> 01:24:04,169
with somebody
in the class.

1755
01:24:04,213 --> 01:24:06,084
Are you
having an affair

1756
01:24:06,128 --> 01:24:08,956
with someone
in the class?

1757

Zip me up.

1758

So where's
the script?
I want to read it.

1759

you'd bring one
with you.

1760

Don't you ever
leave the phone
off the hook

1766
01:24:28,411 --> 01:24:29,368

1767

Don't play

sorry later.

Ahem.

1775
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,135
I did have
an extra ticket,

1776
01:24:57,179 --> 01:25:00,617
but I guess
I don't n-n-need it!

What?

1784
01:25:13,369 --> 01:25:15,197
Evan and Beverly
are fighting.

1785
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,155

have an agreement

1786

telling Evan

1795
01:25:30,037 --> 01:25:32,431

meet more often.

screwing him, too.

gets chained to a bed

01:32:08,653 --> 01:32:10,350
aah, no! God!

1925
01:32:10,394 --> 01:32:13,484
I can tell
by your voice
he's cheating on me!

1926
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:16,487
How could he
do this to me? Oh!

1927
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:18,576
Well, i...i...

1928
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:19,490
I'm sorry.

1929
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:23,494
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.

1930
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:24,626
I feel. I just...

1931
01:32:24,669 --> 01:32:27,324
if it wasn't for
your stupid little film,

1932
01:32:27,367 --> 01:32:29,500
I never would have
found out!

1933
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:30,893
I really don't know.

1934
01:32:30,936 --> 01:32:35,898
If you see carmine,
you tell him
I went for a walk.

01:33:13,675 --> 01:33:15,502

01:33:15,546 --> 01:33:16,634
You're acting
crazy.

1945
01:33:16,678 --> 01:33:20,812
What is this deduction
for item 3-b?

1946
01:33:20,856 --> 01:33:22,945
Where is item 3-b?

1947
01:33:22,988 --> 01:33:24,250
Here it is.

1948
01:33:24,294 --> 01:33:26,644
Roth buried it with the
world premiere tickets.

1949
01:33:26,688 --> 01:33:29,386
It's his, uh,
consulting fee?

1950
01:33:29,429 --> 01:33:31,562
It's a standard clause.

1951
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:32,694
Cut the crap.

1952
01:33:32,737 --> 01:33:34,521
You're skimming off
points for yourself.

1953
01:33:34,565 --> 01:33:36,567
You're stealing
from US.

1954
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:39,526
Heh heh, roth.

1955
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:40,832
That's a
legitimate cost.

1956
01:33:40,876 --> 01:33:43,052
You don't know
the movie business.

1957
01:33:43,095 --> 01:33:44,662
I use that in
my own contracts.

1958
01:33:44,706 --> 01:33:47,491
Are you trying
to bullshit
a bullshitter?

1959
01:33:47,534 --> 01:33:49,014
Marvin,
do me a favor.

1960
01:33:49,058 --> 01:33:50,973
See if you can
find Patricia and
ask her to come in here.

1961
01:33:51,016 --> 01:33:54,585
I think she said she
was going for a walk.

1962
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:55,717
For a walk?

1963
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,633
She didn't feel well.

1964
01:33:58,676 --> 01:34:00,896
Patricia?

1965
01:34:00,939 --> 01:34:04,073
Oh, god.

1966
01:34:04,116 --> 01:34:06,292
The bottom
of page 8.

1967
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:08,947
What's going on?

1968
01:34:08,991 --> 01:34:10,688
You got it?

1969
01:34:10,732 --> 01:34:12,690
That point's going
into your pocket.

1970
01:34:12,734 --> 01:34:14,213
It's for the script.

1971
01:34:14,257 --> 01:34:16,651
The writer deserves
to be paid.

1972
01:34:16,694 --> 01:34:18,000
Not out of our share!

1973
01:34:18,043 --> 01:34:20,437
That's the deal that
was made with the lawyer.

1974
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,047
What are
they talking about?

1975
01:34:22,091 --> 01:34:24,136
We agreed
to split it.

1976
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:26,399
I took one
out of your share.

1977
01:34:26,443 --> 01:34:28,184
Why can't they
take the other one?

1978
01:34:28,227 --> 01:34:31,535
You think you're
selling herring
on Delancey street?

1979
01:34:31,578 --> 01:34:33,450
We've been over this
before.

1980
01:34:33,493 --> 01:34:34,973
Take the points
from my share.

1981
01:34:35,017 --> 01:34:37,584
No! The writer's
not paid that way!

1982
01:34:37,628 --> 01:34:39,021
Roth's not
that far down.

1983
01:34:39,064 --> 01:34:42,372
Why break our balls
if we don't get
our fair share?

1984
01:34:42,415 --> 01:34:44,461
I don't like
dishonesty.

1985
01:34:44,504 --> 01:34:45,897
This is
a small thing.

1986
01:34:45,941 --> 01:34:48,508
It's not
a small thing,
god damn it!

1987
01:34:48,552 --> 01:34:51,033
Enough of
this taking
the rear crap!

1988
01:34:51,076 --> 01:34:53,688
These guys should
suck my cock!

1989
01:34:53,731 --> 01:34:55,385
Watch it!
Watch it!

1990
01:34:55,428 --> 01:34:56,560
Shut up!

1991
01:34:56,603 --> 01:34:57,779
I'm sick of them.

1992
01:34:57,822 --> 01:34:58,736
Relax, relax.

1993
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:00,216
Roth, calm down.

1994
01:35:00,259 --> 01:35:03,175
If Marvin wants to
give up his points,
it's all right.

1995
01:35:03,219 --> 01:35:04,655
What are you
arguing about?

1996
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:06,396
I've been flying
for 12 hours.

1997
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:09,399
I've got another flight
for another 12 hours.

1998
01:35:09,442 --> 01:35:10,792
Don't waste my time.

1999
01:35:10,835 --> 01:35:12,750
[Telephone rings]

2000
01:35:12,794 --> 01:35:13,838
Excuse me.

2001
01:35:13,882 --> 01:35:16,449
[Ring]

2002
01:35:16,493 --> 01:35:17,624
Hello?

2003
01:35:17,668 --> 01:35:20,453
Marvin, I've been in
this god damn business

2004
01:35:20,497 --> 01:35:21,585
for 30 some years.

2005
01:35:21,628 --> 01:35:25,154
Fucking loser!
Don't you dare
blow this!

2006
01:35:25,197 --> 01:35:27,591
No, I can't take
the kids to school.

2007
01:35:27,634 --> 01:35:29,941
I'm going to Tokyo
tomorrow morning.

2008
01:35:29,985 --> 01:35:30,986
To Tokyo?

2009
01:35:31,029 --> 01:35:33,510
Evan...

2010
01:35:33,553 --> 01:35:35,817
Beverly?

2011
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:41,170
I have nothing
to say to you.

2012
01:35:41,213 --> 01:35:42,911
You didn't
like the script?

2013
01:35:42,954 --> 01:35:45,478
The prostitute's roommate
is a black girl

2014
01:35:45,522 --> 01:35:47,785
who's in exactly
three scenes.

2015
01:35:47,829 --> 01:35:48,917
She's naked in two

2016
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,397
and gets
stabbed to death
in the third.

2017
01:35:51,441 --> 01:35:54,444
There is an angelic blonde
who's in every scene

2018
01:35:54,487 --> 01:35:56,359
and dominates
the entire picture.

2019
01:35:56,402 --> 01:35:59,014
I wonder who
gets which part.

2020
01:36:01,407 --> 01:36:04,671
The truth is I haven't
read the script.

2021
01:36:05,629 --> 01:36:07,587
You've got
some scam, Sam.

2022
01:36:07,631 --> 01:36:11,983
I actually thought
that you might be...

2023
01:36:12,027 --> 01:36:13,115
An artist,

2024
01:36:13,158 --> 01:36:14,594
but you're just
another pimp.

2025
01:36:14,638 --> 01:36:19,077
Do you think
I studied six years
with Stella adler

2026
01:36:19,121 --> 01:36:22,515
to do this
exploitative bullshit?

2027
01:36:23,081 --> 01:36:25,127
I have something
very beautiful

2028
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:27,869
and valuable
inside of me,

2029
01:36:27,912 --> 01:36:30,132
and one day...

2030
01:36:30,175 --> 01:36:32,395
I'm going to
get to show it.

2031
01:36:32,438 --> 01:36:35,572
Look, I never meant
for you to do this...

2032
01:36:35,615 --> 01:36:38,488
go fuck yourself,
Marvin.

2033
01:36:49,499 --> 01:36:51,457
The bottom
of page 8.

2034
01:36:51,501 --> 01:36:53,459
Page 8, the bottom.

2035
01:36:54,373 --> 01:36:56,593
Guess it's only a point.

2036
01:36:56,636 --> 01:36:58,464
It's just a point.

2037
01:37:00,292 --> 01:37:03,905
You really tried
to Jew US down,
didn't you, roth?

2038
01:37:03,948 --> 01:37:04,862
I resent that.

2039
01:37:04,906 --> 01:37:06,646
I'm sorry, but
I'm disappointed.

2040
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:08,561
I thought you'd be
a better thief.

2041
01:37:08,605 --> 01:37:12,478
You know what
your reputation is,
you son of a bitch!

2042
01:37:12,522 --> 01:37:13,392
Shut up!

2043
01:37:13,436 --> 01:37:15,264
The whole world's
blown apart,

2044
01:37:15,307 --> 01:37:16,743
and you're
talking about

2045
01:37:16,787 --> 01:37:19,834
a few stupid details!

2046
01:37:19,877 --> 01:37:21,923
Shut up!

2047
01:37:27,667 --> 01:37:29,713
I'm sorry.

2048
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:35,240
I really like you guys.

2049
01:37:45,511 --> 01:37:48,601
You work it out
anyway you want.

2050
01:37:48,645 --> 01:37:51,866
I got to go
find Patricia.

2051
01:38:15,454 --> 01:38:20,459
You should take the
form seminar on integrity.

2052
01:38:20,503 --> 01:38:21,983
I love you so much.

2053
01:38:22,026 --> 01:38:24,637
You bruised my arm,
you little fuck.

2054
01:38:24,681 --> 01:38:25,638
It's over.

2055
01:38:25,682 --> 01:38:26,378
I'm sorry.

2056
01:38:26,422 --> 01:38:28,293
I'm going
to kill you.

2057
01:38:28,337 --> 01:38:30,469
I'm going
to kill you.

2058
01:38:32,123 --> 01:38:35,692
Don't bother.
I'll kill myself.

2059
01:38:36,214 --> 01:38:38,173
No, wait. Marvin,
Stuart's out of control.

2060
01:38:38,216 --> 01:38:40,175
He'll blow
this whole thing.

2061
01:38:40,218 --> 01:38:42,003
If George
finds US in here...

2062
01:38:42,046 --> 01:38:43,961
so there you are.

2063
01:38:44,005 --> 01:38:45,963
Get out of my house.

2064
01:38:46,007 --> 01:38:48,618
George, it's not
what you're thinking.

2065
01:38:48,661 --> 01:38:49,836
You're both disgusting.

2066
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:53,666
That's why you keep going
to his apartment?

2067
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:56,539
No. I didn't
do anything.

2068
01:38:56,582 --> 01:38:59,890
I'm really mad at you
this time, Peggy.

2069
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:03,676
Go to your room!

2070
01:39:07,245 --> 01:39:08,507
Get out of my house

2071
01:39:08,551 --> 01:39:11,510
and take your gangster
partner with you.

2072
01:39:11,554 --> 01:39:12,903
Peggy!

2073
01:39:37,754 --> 01:39:41,453
Make that two tickets
for Tokyo tomorrow.

2074
01:39:41,497 --> 01:39:43,368
Thank you.

2075
01:39:52,508 --> 01:39:55,119
You're very special.

2076
01:39:59,123 --> 01:40:01,386
I am.

2077
01:40:10,830 --> 01:40:13,485
Let's get out of here.

2078
01:40:25,715 --> 01:40:28,935
Patricia...
You know my background.

2079
01:40:28,979 --> 01:40:31,329
You know what
a jerk I've been,

2080
01:40:31,373 --> 01:40:35,116
but if you're willing
to take a chance...

2081
01:40:38,119 --> 01:40:39,642
Carmine...

2082
01:40:40,556 --> 01:40:44,908
Are you asking me
to marry you?

2083
01:40:46,562 --> 01:40:48,520
Yeah?

2084
01:40:48,564 --> 01:40:50,870
Oh...

2085
01:40:57,486 --> 01:41:01,490
Didn't go as well
as I had hoped.

2086
01:41:07,583 --> 01:41:08,671
You o.K.?

2087
01:41:08,714 --> 01:41:11,587
I'm just a pussy-whipped
hack, aren't I?

2088
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:14,851
Come on, kid. Come on.

2089
01:41:14,894 --> 01:41:16,200
She's a pretty girl.

2090
01:41:16,244 --> 01:41:19,116
It happens
to the best of US.

2091
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:26,515
Well, musketeers,
bloody, but not bowed.

2092
01:41:27,124 --> 01:41:29,518
Who the hell
do they think they are?

2093
01:41:29,561 --> 01:41:33,522
Three assholes trying to buy
their way into Hollywood.

2094
01:41:33,565 --> 01:41:37,700
You know, I always believed
in this picture,

2095
01:41:37,743 --> 01:41:41,095
and I go
with my hunches.

2096
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:46,535
I'm putting everything
I got behind it.

2097
01:41:46,578 --> 01:41:48,493
What do you say?

2098
01:41:49,407 --> 01:41:52,106
What do you say, chief?

2099
01:42:20,351 --> 01:42:24,442
Does that mean he
doesn't want to do it?

2100
01:42:26,705 --> 01:42:28,533
Star wizard.

2101
01:42:28,577 --> 01:42:31,971
In October,
the planets
are further away

2102
01:42:32,015 --> 01:42:33,582
than last year.

2103
01:42:33,625 --> 01:42:36,019
This positive...

2104
01:42:36,062 --> 01:42:37,238
this promises

2105
01:42:37,281 --> 01:42:39,718
a generally
positive picture

2106
01:42:39,762 --> 01:42:41,894
in the universe.

2107
01:42:42,547 --> 01:42:44,375
The astrological
prospects...

2108
01:42:44,419 --> 01:42:45,594
Push in.

2109
01:42:45,637 --> 01:42:48,205
Are good for
that new addition
to your home

2110
01:42:48,249 --> 01:42:50,207
that you've
been putting off

2111
01:42:50,251 --> 01:42:52,209
or to further
your commitment

2112
01:42:52,253 --> 01:42:55,517
to that
loving relationship.

2113
01:42:57,519 --> 01:42:59,521
Pull out.

2114
01:43:02,785 --> 01:43:04,482
Star...

2115
01:43:04,526 --> 01:43:06,528
Wizard.

2116
01:43:06,571 --> 01:43:10,053
Have a good year.

2120
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:03,367
Hello.

2121
01:44:03,411 --> 01:44:04,934
Marvin...
How's everything?

2122
01:44:04,977 --> 01:44:06,892
How's your life?

2123
01:44:06,936 --> 01:44:08,677
What you been doing?

2124
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:10,592
Who is this?

2125
01:44:10,635 --> 01:44:13,725
Out of sight,
out of mind, huh?

2126
01:44:13,769 --> 01:44:16,554
It's uncle Jack,
Jack roth.

2127
01:44:17,729 --> 01:44:19,427
Yeah, I'm sorry, Jack.

2128
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:22,299
Um, how are you?

2129
01:44:22,343 --> 01:44:24,301
Marvin,
I can't blame you

2130
01:44:24,345 --> 01:44:26,738
for trying
to forget about me

2131
01:44:26,782 --> 01:44:28,436
after that thing
with those schmucks.

2132
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:32,527
It sure didn't turn out
the way I wanted it to.

2133
01:44:33,745 --> 01:44:36,226
That's o.K.
You did what you could.

2134
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:37,880
I picked up
your script again,

2135
01:44:37,923 --> 01:44:39,534
and I couldn't
put it down.

2136
01:44:39,577 --> 01:44:41,492
You should never
have touched it.

2137
01:44:41,536 --> 01:44:44,408
I had a feeling
about that script,

2138
01:44:44,452 --> 01:44:46,149
and I still do.

2139
01:44:46,192 --> 01:44:47,498
Jack...Jack, listen.

2140
01:44:47,542 --> 01:44:50,327
I don't want to get
involved with this again.

2141
01:44:50,371 --> 01:44:52,286
I've got to
face the fact

2142
01:44:52,329 --> 01:44:54,592
that nobody's
will make it.

2143
01:44:54,636 --> 01:44:55,637
Even if they do,

2144
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:58,553
they won't make it
the way I want it.

2145
01:44:58,596 --> 01:44:59,728
In the real world,

2146
01:44:59,771 --> 01:45:02,208
you don't get your dreams,
and that's o.K.

2147
01:45:02,252 --> 01:45:04,210
There are
other things in life,

2148
01:45:04,254 --> 01:45:06,604
and I want to
get on with them.

2149
01:45:06,648 --> 01:45:09,694
I...i understand
how you feel.

2150
01:45:09,738 --> 01:45:11,827
The only reason i'm
even bothering you

2151
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:16,397
is because
I met a guy at the
friars' club today

2152
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:17,615
and he's loaded,

2153
01:45:17,659 --> 01:45:19,704
and he's hot to get
into the film business.

2154
01:45:19,748 --> 01:45:22,098
I'm having a meeting
with him tomorrow,

2155
01:45:22,141 --> 01:45:27,190
and I figured
I'd invite you along.

01:45:30,759 --> 01:45:32,543
