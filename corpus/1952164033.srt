1
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,482
Queen to the king,
possible straight going there.

2
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,815
Eight on the eight.
And the jack gets a boss.

3
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,912
Eights open.

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,486
Aren't you guys afraid of an officer
coming down here or something?

5
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,531
Trust me.
Nobody ever comes down here but us.

6
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,999
- That thing always do that?
- Do what?

7
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,232
Whatever that thing is under the tarp.

8
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,570
I thought I just saw it move,
or do something...

9
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,941
Probably the only thing
it ever did was cost money.

10
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,511
I'm telling you, the thing is moving!

11
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,345
If you don't have the straight, just fold.

12
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,814
What are you doing?

13
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,715
Hold your fire!

14
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,674
This is Area C.

15
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,268
We're under heavy fire down here.
We need...

16
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,661
To the gate room!

17
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,494
Go, go, go! Move it!

18
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,045
Hold your fire!

19
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,975
I thought I saw someone on
the roof when we came up the drive, sir.

20
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,175
There's a ladder over there.

21
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,527
- Colonel Jack O'Neill?
- Retired.

22
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,626
I'm Major Samuels.

23
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,561
Want a little piece of advice, Major?

24
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:42,037
Get re-assed to NASA.
That's where all the action's gonna be.

25
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,640
Out there.

26
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,542
I'm... I'm under orders to bring you
to see General Hammond, sir.

27
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,949
- Never heard of him.
- He replaced General West.

28
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,989
- I'm a busy man, Major.
- I can see that, sir.

29
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,324
He says it's important.

30
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,652
Has to do with the stargate.

31
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,940
We have to take a second elevator
the rest of the way, sir.

32
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,845
It's a long way down.

33
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,415
Yeah, I know. I've been here before.

34
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,810
Of course.

35
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,094
This way, sir.

36
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,247
Come.

37
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,284
General Hammond, Colonel Jack O'Neill.

38
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,021
Retired.

39
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,586
I can see that. I envy you, Colonel.

40
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,498
Major Samuels mentioned something
about the stargate.

41
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:52,060
Down to business. I can do that.
This way...

42
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,605
Anyone you know, Colonel?

43
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,578
They're not human.

44
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,249
You think?

45
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,148
Best we can tell,
these slits are actually a pouch,

46
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,454
similar to that found in a marsupial.

47
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,118
- Like a kangaroo.
- Mmm.

48
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,257
Except...

49
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,793
In both sexes.

50
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,063
These people, or aliens,
whatever you wanna call them,

51
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,406
came through, killed four of my people

52
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,504
and kidnapped another,
using advanced weapons.

53
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,276
Airman?

54
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,845
Weapons?

55
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,789
Seen one before, I take it?

56
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,761
Yes, sir.

57
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,669
But there are no creatures like this
on Abydos.

58
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,729
Those people were human.
They were from Earth.

59
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,831
Ra brought 'em there
thousands of years ago.

60
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,809
I know all about that.

61
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,711
But your report said this Ra was in fact

62
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,511
some kind of alien that lived
inside a human body.

63
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,314
His eyes glowed. That was our first clue.

64
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,690
Are you sure he's dead, Colonel?

65
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,325
Unless he could survive a tactical
nuclear warhead

66
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,889
blowing up in his face, I'm positive. Why?

67
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:32,664
Well, Colonel, these people,
or whatever they are,

68
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,799
were guarding another man
who retreated back through the stargate.

69
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,568
I got a good look at his eyes, Colonel.
They glowed.

70
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,922
How do you feel about the Stargate
mission after all this time, Colonel?

71
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,423
How do you mean?

72
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,153
Well, it's been over a year.
Has your perspective changed?

73
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,785
Well, sir, I...

74
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,932
Kawalsky and Ferretti? Yes.

75
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,971
Served under your command
on the first Stargate mission.

76
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,873
Have a seat, Colonel.

77
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,281
Tell me about Daniel Jackson, Colonel.

78
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,718
Why are they questioning my men?

79
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,758
They're not your men anymore, Colonel.
You retired.

80
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,418
Daniel Jackson?

81
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,625
- You read the report?
- Yes.

82
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,598
- It's all there.
- Is it?

83
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,594
What's this all about, General?

84
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,140
You didn't like Daniel Jackson, did you?

85
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,176
Basically, he was a geek, sir.

86
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,870
So you didn't have a lot of time for him?

87
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,606
I didn't say that.

88
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,677
He also saved my life and found
the way home for my men and me.

89
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,218
A little thing like that can kind of
make a person grow on you.

90
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,513
According to the mission brief,

91
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,021
your orders were to
go through the stargate,

92
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:01,924
to detect any possible threat to Earth,
and if found, to detonate a nuclear device

93
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,928
and destroy the gate on the other side.

94
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,020
Yes.

95
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,395
But that's
not what you did, is it?

96
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,024
Not right away.

97
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,863
Ra's forces overpowered my team
and took the weapon before I could arm it.

98
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,975
But, with Dr. Jackson's help,
you eventually regained control,

99
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,841
- and did, in fact, detonate the weapon?
- Yes.

100
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:23,370
So, to the best of your knowledge,
Daniel Jackson and everyone else

101
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,009
you knew on Abydos is dead, correct?

102
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,409
That's correct.

103
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:29,579
Good.

104
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,452
Then you won't mind if I authorize
a go-ahead on our plan.

105
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:44,259
This quartz material
the stargates are made of,

106
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,305
it must be tough stuff
if it can withstand a Mark 3.

107
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,342
Well, we sent a robot probe through
after we got back, sir.

108
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,468
It was flattened on the other end.

109
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,345
Obviously, the Abydos stargate
had been buried in the rubble.

110
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,977
But somehow, it got unburied.

111
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,623
Oh, my God!

112
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,625
You're sending another bomb?

113
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,459
A Mark 5 this time.

114
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,392
Unless you have something to add.

115
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,610
General Hammond, sir.

116
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:36,277
I regret to inform you that my report
was not entirely accurate.

117
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:37,886
You didn't detonate the bomb.

118
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,256
I did detonate the bomb, sir,
and it was aboard Ra's spacecraft,

119
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,727
so it did kill him
and eliminate the risk to Earth.

120
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,696
- However...
- However...

121
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:53,202
Ra's ship was in orbit
above the planet at the time.

122
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:58,175
Neither the gate nor anything else
on the planet was destroyed.

123
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,576
Daniel Jackson is alive
and living with the people on Abydos.

124
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,479
You violated direct orders. Why?

125
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,347
Because the people of Abydos
are no threat to us.

126
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,544
They deserve to be left alone.

127
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,110
That's not up to you...

128
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,351
If I'd come back here and reported the gate
on the other side was still intact,

129
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,086
we would've sent another bomb,
just like you were about to.

130
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,288
It wasn't necessary to let those people die.

131
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,955
The threat from Ra was gone.

132
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,159
What about the probe we sent through?
It was crushed instantly.

133
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,896
After we came home,
Daniel buried the gate in rocks,

134
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,996
making my return
or anybody else's impossible.

135
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,932
Those four bodies lying in the infirmary
say otherwise.

136
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,011
Take Colonel O'Neill to the holding room.

137
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:41,075
Give him a little time to think about
things while I decide what to do with him.

138
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,619
Sergeant.

139
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,904
Colonel O'Neill, sir.

140
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,839
I'm retired, Kawalsky. Lose the salute.

141
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,183
Me and Ferretti didn't tell them anything.

142
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,414
I appreciate that.

143
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,389
Hey, those kids on Abydos
saved my life, too.

144
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,624
Yeah. Those kids...

145
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,693
I mean, they're the whole reason
we kept it secret.

146
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,127
Right?

147
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,933
That one kid idolized you. Remember him?

148
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,664
Weird name... What was it?

149
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:37,970
Skaara.

150
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:39,937
Right.

151
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,209
Remember how he was
always saluting you?

152
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,507
Yeah.

153
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,250
My kid used to do that when he was little.

154
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,920
Skaara kind of reminded me of him.

155
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,796
How many people did you say
are on Abydos?

156
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,303
That we saw? Maybe 5,000.

157
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,380
Does this mean you're reconsidering
sending the bomb, sir?

158
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,848
It means I'm open to suggestions.

159
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,878
General, let me take a team
through that gate.

160
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,147
We'll find out who those aliens are.

161
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,523
Kawalsky and I have been there before.
We know the lay of the land.

162
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,583
We know the people.

163
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,960
You think you know them.
Jackson could be dead.

164
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,362
You don't know
what you'd be walking into.

165
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,798
There is one way to find out, sir.

166
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,496
We'll have the prototype probe
shipped from MIT.

167
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,403
No, sir. We don't need that probe.

168
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,402
- We don't?
- Nope. This'll do.

169
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,850
Chevron one encoded.

170
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,860
Chevron two encoded.

171
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,267
Care to explain this concept?

172
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,826
Chevron three encoded.

173
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,769
Jackson has allergies.

174
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,935
I get it.

175
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,242
Chevron four encoded.

176
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,677
He'll know this came from me
and not from someone like...

177
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,344
Yourself.

178
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,846
Chevron five encoded.

179
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,717
Why not just send a note?

180
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,688
- Anyone could send a note.
- Anyone could send a note.

181
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,563
Chevron six encoded.

182
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,840
Chevron seven locked.

183
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,044
Now what?

184
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,875
If Jackson's still around,
he'll know what the message means.

185
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,011
What if the aliens got it?

186
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,886
Well, they could be blowing
their noses right now.

187
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,357
They could be planning an attack.

188
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:45,185
Come on, Samuels.
Let me be the cynic around here, huh?

189
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,856
General, this could take some time.

190
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,895
Incoming wormhole.

191
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,002
Permission to take a team through
the stargate, sir?

192
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,548
Assuming I get
the President's authorization,

193
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,846
the mission briefing will be at 0800 hours.

194
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,183
Consider yourself recalled
to active duty, Colonel.

195
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,174
Gentlemen, take your seats.

196
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,847
Where's Captain Carter?

197
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,446
Just arriving, sir.

198
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,717
Carter?

199
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,723
I'm assigning Sam Carter to this mission.

200
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,327
I'd prefer to put together
my own team, sir.

201
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:02,595
I'm sorry. Not on this mission.
Carter's our expert on the stargate.

202
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,029
Where is he transferring from?

203
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,731
She is transferring
from the Pentagon.

204
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,141
I take it you're Colonel O'Neill.

205
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,942
Captain Samantha Carter reporting, sir.

206
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,812
But, of course, you go by Sam.

207
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,183
Let's get started.

208
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,017
- Colonel?
- All right.

209
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,182
For those of you on your first trip
through the gate,

210
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,125
you should be prepared
for what to expect.

211
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,426
Well, I've practically memorized
your report from the first mission, sir.

212
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,331
I'd like to think I've been
preparing for this all my life.

213
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,028
I think what the Colonel is saying is,

214
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:41,903
have you ever pulled out of a simulated
bombing run in an F-16 at eight-plus Gs?

215
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,032
Yes.

216
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,841
Well, it's way worse than that.

217
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,905
By the time you get to the other side,
you're frozen stiff,

218
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,883
like you've just been through a blizzard.

219
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,249
That's a result of the compression
your molecules undergo

220
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,550
during the millisecond required
for reconstitution.

221
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,750
Here we go. Another scientist.

222
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,292
General, please.

223
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,089
Theoretical astrophysicist.

224
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,458
Which means?

225
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,293
Means she's smarter than you are, Colonel.

226
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,358
Especially in matters
related to the stargate.

227
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:22,646
Well, you can believe me, this has nothing
to do with you being a woman.

228
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,448
I like women.

229
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,879
I've just got a little problem
with scientists.

230
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:32,390
Well, Colonel, I logged over 100 hours
in enemy airspace during the Gulf War.

231
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,220
Is that tough enough for you?

232
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,818
Or are we gonna have to arm wrestle?

233
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,697
I don't mean to throw a damper
on your enthusiasm,

234
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,760
but I still say the safest
and most logical way

235
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:49,136
is to bury the stargate,
just like the ancient Egyptians did,

236
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,641
make it impossible for the aliens to return.

237
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,110
It's the only way to eliminate the threat.

238
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,443
- Except it won't work.
- It worked before.

239
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,882
How do you all think the stargate
got to Earth in the first place?

240
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,009
Good question.

241
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,883
They've got ships, General.

242
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:05,684
Ra had one as big as the great pyramids.

243
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:10,524
They don't need the stargate to get here.
They can do it the old-fashioned way.

244
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:15,495
Now, with all due respect
to Mr. Glass-ls-Half-Empty over here,

245
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,535
don't you think maybe
we should use the stargate

246
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:21,595
to do a little reconnaissance
before they decide to show up again?

247
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:37,851
I'll give you exactly 24 hours to either
return or send a message through.

248
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,914
No Kleenex boxes, please.

249
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:43,893
Otherwise, I will assume the worst,
and send a bomb through.

250
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,494
Understood.

251
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,642
- Try to follow orders this time, Colonel.
- Sir?

252
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,176
This time, you bring Daniel Jackson back.
Is that clear?

253
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,619
Move out!

254
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,708
My God! Look at this!

255
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:36,211
You can actually see the fluctuations
in the event horizon.

256
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,781
Lower your guns.

257
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,700
Hello, Jack. Welcome back.

258
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,183
- Skaara.
- O'Neer.

259
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,688
I did not think to be seeing you again.

260
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,227
How are you, Daniel?

261
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,666
Good. You?

262
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,505
Much better, now that I know
everybody's okay.

263
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,007
Greetings from Earth, Dr. Jackson.

264
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,868
Hello, Ferretti.

265
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,344
Brought you a little something, Daniel.

266
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,778
Kawalsky.

267
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,081
Sha're, don't be shy.

268
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,389
It's good to see you again.

269
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,358
So, I figured it was only a matter of time

270
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,921
before you had to tell the truth
about us still being here.

271
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,091
Yeah.

272
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,495
Why the militia?
Something else come through?

273
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,062
- No, we're just taking precautions. Why?
- Amazing.

274
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,132
This is what was missing
from the dig at Giza.

275
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,072
This is how they controlled it.

276
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,671
It took us 15 years
and three supercomputers

277
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,342
to jury-rig a control system
for the gate on Earth!

278
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,682
- Captain.
- Look how small it is!

279
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,015
Captain!

280
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,077
Oh.

281
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:33,988
Right.

282
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,162
Dr. Jackson, I presume.

283
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,756
I'm Dr. Samantha Carter.

284
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,822
Hi.

285
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,301
What's going on, Jack?

286
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,339
Six hostile aliens came through
the stargate on Earth.

287
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,935
Four people are dead, one's missing.

288
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,613
One of them looked like Ra, Daniel.

289
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,081
Well,
they didn't come from here.

290
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,151
I mean, the boys take shifts guarding it,
36 hours a day, every day.

291
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,848
We'd know if they came through here.

292
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:09,223
Well, they came from somewhere, Daniel.
I'm gonna have to look around.

293
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,754
I think I can help you find out who it was,

294
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:16,232
but it's going to have to wait
till the sandstorm is over.

295
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,337
We were about to have our evening meal.
Why don't you join us?

296
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,687
I'm sure the folks at MIT would be happy
to know their million-dollar probe

297
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,662
also makes fine cookware.

298
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,996
Well, it got pretty banged up when it came
through the gate into our barricade,

299
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:54,505
so we made use, and...
Well, it is non-stick titanium, so it...

300
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,338
Very good. Perfect.

301
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,642
Beanaa wa. Everybody try this.

302
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,179
This too.

303
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,119
What's this?

304
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,283
Drink.

305
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:20,223
Moonshine? Did you make this?

306
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,723
Moonshine?

307
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,030
Yeah, moonshine. As in booze.

308
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,763
Daniel, what are you teaching these kids?

309
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,865
Our little soldiers
are all grown up, Colonel.

310
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,037
Try it.

311
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:39,742
All right. Skaara's moonshine.
Let's give it a shot.

312
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,214
Oh, God!

313
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,852
Smooth. Very smooth.

314
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,691
Moonshine.

315
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,365
I'm so proud.

316
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,156
Wow!

317
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,900
O'Neer...

318
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,569
No. It's yours.

319
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,405
I gave that to you to keep. Remember?

320
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,747
Thank you.

321
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,927
You know, he's never had that out of his
sight the whole time you were gone.

322
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,086
Yeah?

323
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:31,197
So this man who looked like Ra,
he must've come through another gate.

324
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,497
- What other gate?
- Another stargate?

325
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,903
- The stargate only goes here.
- No. No. I think you're wrong about that.

326
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,135
I was there.
We ran hundreds of permutations.

327
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,268
But you didn't have what you need.

328
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,313
Daniel, what are you talking about?

329
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,905
Daniel, the storm has passed.

330
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,107
I'll show you.

331
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,677
Sha're, ben qua ri Jack and his
friends to see the vili tao an.

332
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,747
No, no, I won't be long.

333
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,771
Goodbye, my Daniel.

334
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,145
Goodbye.

335
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,477
Bye.

336
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,637
- I can't say I missed this place.
- Come on.

337
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,510
- This is just incredible.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

338
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,255
Let go of me!

339
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,535
Where the hell are you taking me?

340
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,697
Come.

341
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,902
Let go of me.

342
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,179
Lovely. Full of life.

343
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,590
You could be the vessel
for my future queen.

344
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,457
Yes. Very nice, indeed.

345
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,536
But I am not the one
you must finally please.

346
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,437
A shame.

347
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,502
So, I figured that
there had to be

348
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,630
more to this place, so I started exploring.

349
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,731
Just the area around the town
and the pyramid, at first.

350
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,537
Then after about a month,
I found this place.

351
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,942
Doctor, you're gonna love this.

352
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,380
Oh, my God!

353
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,949
This is the archeological find
of the century. There must be...

354
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,353
Thousands of lines of hieroglyphs.

355
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:49,587
So, Daniel, have you had a chance
to translate this yet?

356
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,992
- I think so.
- What's it say?

357
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,999
Well, it doesn't say anything.

358
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,736
Actually, it's sort of a chart,
more of a map.

359
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:01,965
A map?

360
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,067
Of?

361
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,639
Well, I haven't been able
to analyze all of it.

362
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,307
I mean, look at it.
It would take my whole life.

363
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,249
Well, Daniel, we don't have
that much time.

364
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,878
What's it a map of?

365
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,752
Well, the cartouches seem to be
separated clearly into groupings.

366
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,452
Each grouping is attached to the others
with a series of lines.

367
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,654
And each grouping of glyphs
contain seven symbols.

368
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,629
So you can see where
this is going, of course.

369
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,927
Why don't you tell us anyway?

370
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,828
All the symbols are on
the stargate in the Abydos chamber.

371
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,237
I've also managed to chart
some of them in the Abydos night sky,

372
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,332
or at least pretty close.

373
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:43,612
I think that this is a map of
a vast network of stargates.

374
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,172
Stargates that are all over the galaxy!

375
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,684
I don't think that can be, Doctor.

376
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,116
Why not?

377
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:54,055
Well, because after Colonel O'Neill
and his team came back,

378
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,150
my team ran hundreds
of symbol permutations,

379
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:59,094
using Earth as the point of origin,
and it never worked.

380
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,996
Then where did your Ra lookalike
come from?

381
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,196
Look, I don't pretend to know
anything about astrophysics,

382
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,068
but couldn't the planets change?

383
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,544
I mean, drift apart or something
like that to throw this map off?

384
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,908
- I knew I'd like you.
- Really?

385
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,884
I mean... You mean, I'm right?

386
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,583
The galaxy is a vortex.

387
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:26,418
All the stars are constantly moving
in relation to one another.

388
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,425
So in the thousands of years
since the stargate was built...

389
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,653
All the coordinates could've changed.

390
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,025
But why does it still work
between Abydos and Earth?

391
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,724
Well, Abydos is probably the closest
planet in the network to Earth.

392
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,597
I mean, the closer they are, the less
the difference in relative position.

393
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,761
The further away,
the greater the difference.

394
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,533
In a few thousand more years, it won't
work between Earth and Abydos either.

395
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,199
Unless you can adjust
for the displacement.

396
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,869
Right. Now, with this map as a base,
that should be easy.

397
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,378
All we have to do is correct
for stellar drift.

398
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,608
Then, I should be able to arrive
at a computer model

399
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:55,118
that will predict the adjustments
necessary to get the gate working again.

400
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:59,350
So the stargate can go other places?

401
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,482
- Well, yes. Yes, it could.
- Probably.

402
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,427
Sir, with your permission, I'd like to put
this entire cartouche on digital video.

403
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,056
Then, when we get back to Earth,
I can download it into the computer

404
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,565
and get faster results.

405
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,124
Yeah, go ahead.

406
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,892
Man, you gotta give Daniel credit.
She is one beautiful woman.

407
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,496
Go, go, go.

408
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,604
This is not your weapon.
Where did you get it?

409
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,826
A good choice, Teal'c.

410
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,026
A perfect specimen.

411
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,245
You may be the one.

412
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:34,798
Sha're!

413
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,669
Hey, what's up, guys?

414
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,046
I wonder if he saw the symbols.

415
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,711
Bolaa!

416
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,320
It's all right. Just tell me what happened.

417
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,023
It was Ra.

418
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,319
Okay. Okay.

419
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,024
Hang in there, Ferretti.

420
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,725
- What's going on?
- Ra is dead.

421
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:07,970
No... Ra, I saw... He took Sha're.

422
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,840
He took Skaara into the chaapa 'ai.

423
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,940
Where? Did you see?
Show me the pictures.

424
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,980
Did you see?

425
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,819
Come on.

426
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,930
What's going on, Daniel?
Could there be another Ra?

427
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,796
How in the hell should I know?

428
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,563
I should have left the barricade up.
This is my fault.

429
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,969
Colonel, Ferretti needs
medical attention now!

430
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,904
Go! Help him. I can send you back.

431
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,670
You're coming with us this time, Daniel.
I've got orders.

432
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,212
I don't care about your orders, Colonel.

433
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,804
My wife is out there. So is Skaara.

434
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,907
And the only way we're gonna get 'em
back is for you to come home with us.

435
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,509
Ferretti might have
seen those coordinates.

436
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,680
I've got everything I need.

437
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,374
After we go through the chaapa 'ai,

438
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:29,510
you have to bury it like we did before,
and then leave this place.

439
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,751
- You come back?
- No.

440
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,322
No, I can't. Nobody can.

441
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:39,192
That's what I'm telling you.
Not for a long time.

442
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,657
Now, as soon as we're gone,
I want you to close it. Bury it.

443
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,963
Put a big, heavy cover stone over it.

444
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,627
Nothing good can ever
come through this gate.

445
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,365
Do you understand?

446
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,471
You came through it, Daniel.

447
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,974
Do you remember the story I told you?

448
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,644
How the ancient Egyptians back on Earth
cut themselves off from Ra?

449
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,553
Well, that is exactly what you have to do.

450
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:10,689
Then, in one year, one year from this day,
you take the cover stone away.

451
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,696
I will try to bring Sha're home
with me on that day.

452
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:16,562
But if I don't make it back, if I don't...

453
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:20,001
If I don't return, then you must
bury the gate again forever, joa qua?

454
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,139
Promise me.

455
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,470
- Yes.
- Yes.

456
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,173
We promise, Daniel.

457
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,414
You tell Sha're's father, in one year...

458
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,272
Incoming wormhole.
Stand by for arrival.

459
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,671
Close the iris! Close the iris!

460
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,919
What the hell's that, sir?

461
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,118
That's our insurance against
any more surprises.

462
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,054
What happened, Colonel?

463
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,760
Base camp was hit while
we were on recon, sir.

464
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,668
Ferretti's hurt,
Currin and Swope are down.

465
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,772
Same hostiles who attacked us?

466
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,569
That's a fair guess.

467
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,805
Jackson's wife and one of our kids
was kidnapped.

468
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,605
General, hi. I'm Daniel Jackson.
We've never met.

469
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:13,844
I'd like to be on the team
that goes after them.

470
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:17,216
You're not in any position
to make demands, Jackson.

471
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,122
Ferretti might have seen
the sequence of symbols

472
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:27,857
they used to go through the stargate.

473
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:30,161
That should tell us where they went.

474
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:34,136
General, Dr. Jackson found
an entire cartouche on Abydos

475
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,105
with 1,000 possible coordinates,
maybe more.

476
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,508
That's 1,000 new worlds, General.

477
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:42,272
And our stargate can take us
to these worlds?

478
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,042
With this new data, as long as we make
the appropriate allowances

479
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,514
for alignment in the targeting computer...

480
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,880
Yes or no?

481
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,583
I think so, sir. Yes.

482
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:54,179
Request permission to upload the symbols
into the base supercomputer for analysis.

483
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:57,989
And, sir, I'd like to lead the rescue mission
once we find out where these hostiles are.

484
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:01,327
We'll discuss that request in a briefing
at 0800 hours.

485
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,128
Captain Carter, the base computer
is at your disposal.

486
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:08,001
In the meantime, get this man
some clean clothing. He stinks.

487
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,650
Your death cannot help her.

488
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,461
I am not afraid of you!

489
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,106
No!

490
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,431
Doc says he's gonna make it.

491
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:52,870
Yes, sir.

492
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:58,208
- You gonna stay here all night?
- Yes, sir.

493
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:20,929
Hey.

494
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,632
They don't know what to do with me.

495
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:29,874
And I don't know what to do with myself.

496
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,479
Come on. Let's get out of here.

497
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,734
- Nice catch.
- Thank you.

498
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:02,267
Sorry. Gate travel always seems
to make my allergies...

499
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,880
- Sorry.
- So, you were saying...

500
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,544
Anyway...

501
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,217
As soon as you were gone
and they realized they were free,

502
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:18,659
I mean, Abydos was
their world for the taking.

503
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,431
- Had a little party, did you?
- Yeah. Yeah, big, big party.

504
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,499
They treated me like their savior.
It was embarrassing.

505
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,867
Savior of Abydos? Doesn't sound so bad.

506
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:35,810
Yeah, I spent the first year having to stop
everyone I saw from bowing all the time.

507
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,938
It's amazing you turned out so normal.

508
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,950
Well, if it wasn't for Sha're, I probably...

509
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,851
She was the complete opposite
of everyone else.

510
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,019
She practically fell on the floor
laughing every time

511
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:54,063
I tried to do some chore
they all took for granted.

512
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:57,123
Like, grinding yaphetta flour.

513
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,868
I mean, have you ever tried
to grind your own flour?

514
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,764
I'm trying to kick the flour thing.

515
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,511
This is going straight to my head.

516
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:12,347
What time is it anyway?
I must have gate-lag or something.

517
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,510
Daniel, for crying out loud,
you've had one beer.

518
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,177
You're a cheaper date than my wife was.

519
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,984
Yes, when am I going to meet your wife?

520
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:24,922
Probably never.

521
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:33,264
After I came back from Abydos
the first time, she'd already left.

522
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,270
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. So was I.

523
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:44,103
I think in her heart she forgave me
for what happened to our kid.

524
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,877
She just couldn't forget.

525
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,081
And what about you?

526
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,981
I'm the opposite. I'll never forgive myself.

527
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,721
But sometimes, I can forget.

528
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:16,736
People, what is spoken of in this room
is classified as SCI, top secret.

529
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:20,346
Colonel, what do we know about
these hostiles we didn't yesterday?

530
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:21,975
Not a hell of a lot, General.

531
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:26,614
The Abydon boys who survived the attack
on base camp thought it was Ra.

532
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,089
I thought he was dead.
Gentlemen, which is it?

533
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,455
He's dead. He's definitely dead.

534
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:33,189
I mean, the bomb...
I mean, he's gotta be dead, right?

535
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:35,423
- Then who's coming through the stargate?
- Gods.

536
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:38,866
- What?
- Not as in "God" god.

537
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,197
Ra played a god, the sun god.

538
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,363
He borrowed the religion and culture
of the ancient Egyptians

539
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,930
he brought through the gate,
and then he used it to enslave them.

540
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:48,671
You see, he wanted the people of Abydos
to believe that he was the only one.

541
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:51,373
You're saying
Ra's not the last of his race, after all?

542
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,939
- Maybe he's got a brother, Ray.
- That's what we need.

543
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:56,713
Wait a minute.
The legend goes, Ra's race was dying.

544
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:59,312
He survived by taking over the body
of his human host, an Egyptian boy.

545
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,983
But who's to say more of his kind
couldn't do the same thing?

546
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,051
I mean, this could have happened
at any time, anywhere there's a gate.

547
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:07,494
I mean, this could be happening right now.

548
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,124
Colonel, you've had the most experience
in fighting this hostile.

549
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,499
Assuming you have to defend yourself
in the field, are you up to it?

550
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,435
- We beat 'em once.
- I'll take that as a maybe.

551
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:18,235
Captain Carter, you're confident
that the stargate will take us

552
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,367
where we want to go
with this new information?

553
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,275
Well, the computer's feeding
the revised coordinates

554
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,142
into the targeting computer right now.

555
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,579
It'll take time to calculate,

556
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,174
but it should spit out
two or three destinations a month.

557
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,718
Let's not fool ourselves here, people.

558
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:33,119
This thing is both vast and dangerous,
and we are in so far over our heads

559
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,589
we can barely see daylight.

560
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:39,288
These hostiles we are up against possess
technology so far superior to our own,

561
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:41,523
we don't have the faintest idea
how it works.

562
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:45,090
We would all be much better off
if the stargate had been left in the ground.

563
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:48,001
With respect, sir, we can't bury
our heads in the sand.

564
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:51,165
I mean, think of how much we could learn.
Think of what we could bring back.

565
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:54,733
What you could bring back is precisely
what I'm afraid of, Captain.

566
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:58,212
However, the President of the
United States happens to agree with you.

567
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,910
In the event your theories pan out, he
has ordered the formation of nine teams,

568
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,977
whose duties will be to perform
reconnaissance, determine threats,

569
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:08,855
and if possible, to make peaceful contact
with the peoples of these worlds.

570
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:12,156
Now, these teams will operate
on a covert, top-secret basis.

571
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:16,825
No one will know of their existence,
except the President and the joint chiefs.

572
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,390
- Colonel O'Neill.
- Sir?

573
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,561
Your team will be designated SG-1.

574
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,662
The team will consist of yourself,
Captain Carter...

575
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:23,967
And me?

576
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,535
Dr. Jackson, we need you
to work as a consultant

577
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,340
with the other SG teams from here.

578
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:32,279
Your expertise in ancient cultures
and languages are far too valuable...

579
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:34,817
I really have to be on their team.

580
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,354
My wife is out there, General. I need to go.

581
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,356
I'll take that under consideration.

582
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,953
Major Kawalsky, you will head SG-2.

583
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,289
I will?

584
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,301
Colonel O'Neill keeps telling me
it's about time you had a command.

585
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,599
I had a moment of weakness.

586
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:02,969
Ferretti is conscious, sir.

587
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:05,979
Dismissed.

588
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,323
I'll take over. Thanks.

589
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,290
- Ferretti.
- Hey.

590
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:18,856
Listen, Ferretti.

591
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:23,590
I know you're probably not feeling so hot,
but we need something from you.

592
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:30,670
Looks like
he's way ahead of you, Colonel.

593
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,043
You saw all seven symbols?

594
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,553
This is where they went? You sure?

595
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,822
Colonel, I'd like to remind you,

596
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:55,023
in the event that you fail to notify
base camp within 24 hours,

597
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:58,226
SG-2 will scrub the mission,
and return without you.

598
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,598
Understood!

599
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:03,196
Not gonna happen, Colonel.
SG-2 won't leave without you.

600
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:05,538
All right, let's confirm transmitter codes.

601
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,077
Remember, only the right code
will open the iris,

602
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,704
and if you lose the transmitter,
you cannot get home.

603
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,872
Understood, sir.

604
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,939
Chevron seven unlocked.

605
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,083
Let's move out.

606
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:29,959
Kind of wish I was going with you.

607
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,900
Yeah?
I'm kind of glad you're staying behind.

608
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:09,764
Damn.

609
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,741
Dammit, it's cold!

610
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,347
Okay, people, let's get the gear out!
Let's move!

611
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,185
Does anybody have a Kleenex?

612
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:45,800
Come.

613
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:49,073
No! No!

614
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,869
No!

615
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:57,582
This one has spirit.

616
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,337
Does she please you, my love?

617
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,249
It must be some sort
of ceremonial place.

618
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,345
The gate is, has to be, an integral
part of their spiritual culture.

619
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,856
See, this place was built for worshippers.

620
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:19,384
Well, let's just try to be on our way
before the worshippees show up, huh?

621
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,229
You figure out yet how to align
this gate to get back home?

622
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,357
Yeah.
The device is the same as on Abydos.

623
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,425
- This symbol represents...
- Brief Kawalsky's team yet?

624
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,336
- Yes. This symbol represents...
- Good job.

625
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,035
We'll have to set up camp where
there's better cover, Colonel.

626
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,204
Sirs, I found what looks like a trail
down the mountain.

627
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,043
Looks like it's seen traffic
in the last couple of days.

628
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,481
Thank you, Airman. Carter?

629
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:45,350
I set up a line of Claymores along
that ridge at 10 meter intervals.

630
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:47,013
That sound about right, Kawalsky?

631
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,819
Yeah. That'll work.

632
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:08,108
This looks like a good spot right up here!

633
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:24,153
- All right. If we're not back in 20 hours...
- We'll come rescue your sorry asses.

634
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,251
Negative.

635
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:28,388
You'll go back through the gate
with the combination Daniel just gave you,

636
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:30,432
- as you were ordered.
- Yes, sir.

637
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,025
If we don't make it back,
it's 'cause we got our butts kicked,

638
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:36,094
- and that means you're out of here.
- Yes, sir.

639
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:40,165
- Hold down the fort.
- Pick me up a T-shirt.

640
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,979
So, Dr. Jackson,
tell me more about Sha're.

641
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:54,387
- How did you meet?
- Sha're? Well, she's...

642
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:55,515
She was a gift.

643
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:59,790
She was, actually, from the elders
of Abydos the first night we were there.

644
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,989
- And you accepted?
- Hold up!

645
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:03,557
What?

646
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,865
- See any weapons?
- No, sir.

647
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,413
They're worshippers.

648
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,815
All right, Captain,
take a position 50 yards...

649
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,884
For crying out loud.

650
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,754
The man has not changed.

651
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:37,521
Hi.

652
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:42,304
We just came through the stargate...

653
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,236
The chaapa 'ai?

654
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:52,480
No, please don't do that.

655
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,082
- Friends of yours?
- No.

656
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,577
Unless we want to get ourselves
a really bad reputation,

657
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:02,250
I just think we should avoid shooting
the first people we meet on a new planet.

658
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,192
Please, you don't have to do this.

659
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:18,938
"Choose." They want to know
if we're here to choose.

660
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:25,205
Sure. We can choose. Choosing is good.

661
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,850
It's a derivation of Arabic, combined with...

662
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:33,479
Yeah, yeah, all right, whatever.

663
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:37,083
Just ask them to take us
to the nearest village or town.

664
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:41,954
Would you take us to...
Would you take us to...

665
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:48,029
Chulak. Chulak.

666
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:52,935
Chulak, eh?

667
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,049
Chulak.

668
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:24,632
Chulak. Sounds good.

669
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:28,199
I hear it's nice this time of year.

670
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:51,589
- Why are they treating us like this?
- They think we're gods.

671
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,028
Incredible.

672
01:03:56,499 --> 01:04:00,595
This is a feast of some kind.
Apparently, someone's been expected.

673
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:06,471
Okay. We're gods. Now what?

674
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,534
I have no idea.

675
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:13,007
Maybe you should tell them
we want to look around, Daniel.

676
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,221
When in Rome...

677
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,622
Behold,

678
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,064
your queen.

679
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:09,998
Sha're?

680
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:18,475
- Sha're, thank God, I thought we'd never...
- Kneel before your queen!

681
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:21,774
Sha're, it's me!

682
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,799
Daniel. Daniel.

683
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:44,897
- Sha're!
- Easy.

684
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,805
- You've been unconscious for hours.
- No. I saw her.

685
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:49,344
- I know. We all did.
- I saw Sha're.

686
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:54,910
- Where are we?
- Some sort of prison.

687
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:02,557
Come on, sit down. Sit down. Easy.

688
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,124
It all happened so fast.

689
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:15,364
I mean, Ra sent you flying across
the room, a guard zapped the colonel.

690
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:16,564
Next thing I remember, we're all here.

691
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,073
No, it wasn't Ra. It was Apophis.

692
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,266
Who?

693
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:25,176
It's from Egyptian mythology.
Ra was the sun god who ruled the day.

694
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:27,579
Apophis was the serpent god,
Ra's rival, who ruled the night.

695
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:31,279
It's right out of The Book of the Dead.
They're living it.

696
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,418
What's he done to Sha're?
I've got to find her.

697
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:38,925
We can't.

698
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:43,461
- If I could just...
- Daniel, you saw her eyes.

699
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:46,964
- Well, maybe it's some kind of drug...
- These hostiles are parasites.

700
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:49,504
They use human beings as hosts.
That's what Ra did. That...

701
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:53,064
No, I don't believe that.
I'm sorry, I just... I can't.

702
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:59,237
If there's a way out of here,
I haven't found it yet.

703
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,907
But look what I did find.

704
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:04,646
- Daniel! You're okay!
- I think so.

705
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:07,746
Easy, big guy.

706
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,686
Welcome back
to the land of the conscious.

707
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,091
O'Neer told me about Sha're.

708
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:15,324
- Jack, help me. We can find her again.
- Daniel.

709
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:16,791
Don't.

710
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:23,827
Look, get some rest.
By all rights, you should be dead.

711
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,508
- You still got that transmitter?
- Yeah.

712
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:32,308
All right, we may have to destroy it.

713
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,748
If we can't find a way out of here,
the mission's a bust anyway,

714
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:39,151
and we don't want Apockhead or whatever
his name is to get his hands on that thing.

715
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:43,487
Well, he still wouldn't know the code.
There's half a billion permutations.

716
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:48,696
Don't take this personally, but
they're way smarter than we are.

717
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,728
Come on, Skaara,
let's find a way out of here.

718
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,372
What is this?

719
01:07:58,174 --> 01:08:00,699
It's a watch. It tells me the time.

720
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:07,711
Where are you from?

721
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,543
Earth. Chicago, if you wanna be...

722
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:15,147
Your words mean nothing.
Where are you from?

723
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:16,816
Excuse me.

724
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:21,963
This is where we're from.

725
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:41,274
Friendly fellow.

726
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:44,251
What do you think that was about?

727
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,920
I don't know.

728
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:50,715
Come on, Skaara.

729
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,669
Warren, let's go! Rise and shine!

730
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:07,441
The sun is... The suns are coming up.
We're gonna be all right.

731
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:10,812
We can't go through another night
like that, Major.

732
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,145
Yeah. Gets a little chilly
on this planet at night.

733
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:17,577
The Colonel should've sent us
a message by now.

734
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,984
When do you have to make the decision

735
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,888
whether or not to go back
to the stargate?

736
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:25,290
That'll be about when hell freezes over.

737
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,295
I think that pretty much describes
our current situation.

738
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:28,921
We are not leaving here
without the Colonel.

739
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,727
Is that understood?

740
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,446
General, the warhead is armed
and ready for you to give the word, sir.

741
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,815
How much time have we got left?

742
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,118
Just under five hours.

743
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:57,419
Let's keep our fingers off the trigger
until the time comes, shall we?

744
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:58,755
Yes, sir.

745
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:16,710
- Sha're is dead?
- Yeah.

746
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,202
No.

747
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:22,473
- Know what, Skaara? I don't know.
- We will save her.

748
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,519
I can't promise you anything
at the moment.

749
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,555
But you are a great warrior!
We defeated Ra together!

750
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:30,058
Yeah, I know, but look around here.
Look what we're up against.

751
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:38,064
We'll try.

752
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:42,697
Come on.

753
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,616
What did he say?

754
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:05,961
They're going to choose.

755
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:07,594
Choose what?

756
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:11,759
Who will be the children of the gods.

757
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:40,089
Sha're.

758
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:41,356
Jack, help me, please.

759
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,898
- Daniel!
- Daniel! Don't! Don't!

760
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,072
Kneel before your masters!

761
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:22,533
Skaara.

762
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:36,037
Daniel!

763
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,970
This one is passionate.

764
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:41,345
How much would I remember
if you chose me?

765
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,942
- Daniel, what are you doing?
- Tell me.

766
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,446
Something of the host must survive.

767
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:51,587
Nothing.

768
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,336
Him.

769
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,478
Skaara!

770
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:21,388
O'Neer! O'Neer! O'Neer!

771
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:34,925
Kill the rest.

772
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:02,553
I can save these people!

773
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:06,161
Help me.

774
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:12,536
Many have said that.

775
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,883
But you are the first I believe could do it!

776
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:47,270
Get out of the way!

777
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,381
Come on, let's move!

778
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:08,088
Let's go, let's go, come on!

779
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:31,480
You gonna be okay?

780
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,031
Hey! Come on!

781
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:52,570
I have nowhere to go.

782
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:56,844
For this, you can stay at my place!
Let's go!

783
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,278
What's your name?

784
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:04,843
Teal'c.

785
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,684
Teal'c, where will they
take Skaara, the boy?

786
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:08,814
To the stargate.

787
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:13,224
After they've selected hosts for
their children, they will return home.

788
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:27,004
Sir, they have just under an hour
until the deadline.

789
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:29,009
We should've heard from them by now.

790
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:31,602
A lot can happen in an hour, Major.

791
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:35,678
Okay, come on, people!
We're almost there! Let's go!

792
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,981
We've got less than an hour.
How're we doing?

793
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:40,044
We lost a few when we reached the forest.

794
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:42,181
They will be hunted down and killed.

795
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:45,420
Anyone who does not exist
to serve the gods is their enemy.

796
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,291
And that makes you...

797
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,629
I am a Jaffa.
Bred to serve, that they may live.

798
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,230
I don't understand.

799
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:01,774
Man!

800
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:04,868
What the hell is that?

801
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:08,347
It is an infant Goa'uld,
the larval form of the gods.

802
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:12,352
I have carried one since I was a child,
as all Jaffa carry one.

803
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:16,955
This is the twelfth I have carried.

804
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,016
Well, get it out of there!

805
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:24,261
In exchange for carrying
the infant Goa'uld until maturity,

806
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:27,358
a Jaffa receives perfect health
and long life.

807
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:31,302
If I were to remove it,
I would eventually die.

808
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:35,338
Well, if I were you, I'd take my chances.

809
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:37,475
Why did you do this?

810
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,481
The Goa'uld are conquerors, nothing more.

811
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:43,384
Not worthy of worship or sacrifice.

812
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:46,615
You are the first to come along
with powers that approach theirs.

813
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:47,916
Powers?

814
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:51,592
You are strong,
perhaps strong enough to destroy them.

815
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,996
All right, people! Let's go! Let's move!

816
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:09,942
The boy you seek is no longer who he was.

817
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,214
I don't wanna hear that.

818
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:09,436
Take cover! Take cover!

819
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:48,575
Colonel, we're sitting ducks here!

820
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:01,450
Hold on.

821
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:07,392
Now, fire!

822
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:39,920
- Kawalsky?
- Kawalsky.

823
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,127
Yeah!

824
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,257
- Come on, folks!
- Come on, people!

825
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:47,733
Up the hill!

826
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:58,844
Great shot.

827
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:02,178
- How many are there?
- A dozen, maybe more.

828
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,410
They're going back through the gate.

829
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:04,850
What about Skaara?

830
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,444
He's with them.

831
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:15,921
Warren! Casey! On my right!

832
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:28,135
- No.
- Wait, sir.

833
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:32,039
Skaara!

834
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:42,851
Skaara.

835
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:22,255
- Did you see the symbols?
- No.

836
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,636
Sir, we got hostiles
coming out of the trees!

837
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:34,467
Okay, people,
we're going on a little fieldtrip!

838
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:37,705
Daniel, get busy on that stargate.
We got company.

839
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:38,768
Captain, arm your Claymores.

840
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,576
Me and Casey and Warren'll be
the last men out.

841
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:45,483
Negative. That's my job.
Captain, help Daniel.

842
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:48,214
Once you've sent the signal,
I want you to go through.

843
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:49,779
Tell 'em we're bringing company.

844
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,588
Let's go, move, move, move! Let's go!

845
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:00,968
We can't hold 'em, sir!

846
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,367
Pull 'em out!

847
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:04,496
Fall back, fall back. Now.

848
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:12,507
- Daniel.
- It's here.

849
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,774
Go! Go!

850
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:18,513
Come on!

851
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:24,791
Send the signal
as soon as it opens, Captain.

852
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:39,735
- Check the coordinates.
- Looking at 'em now.

853
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,373
- No signal yet, General.
- Stand by.

854
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:45,807
Wait! There it is.

855
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:48,516
- Is it working?
- Let's hope so.

856
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:00,188
Hit the Claymores!

857
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:09,367
Captain, let's get these people
out of here now! Move!

858
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:12,873
Give me a few seconds,
then start sending them through.

859
01:25:23,518 --> 01:25:24,883
Stand fast!

860
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:27,620
Hold your fire! They're refugees!

861
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:31,089
I hope you know
what you're doing, Captain.

862
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:35,525
Go, go, go! Please!

863
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:49,001
Go, go, go. Stop, stop, stop.

864
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:51,568
Now, okay. Come on! Come on!

865
01:25:57,418 --> 01:25:58,476
Nice!

866
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:06,658
That's it!

867
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:08,284
Go!

868
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,093
Casey, Warren, fall back!

869
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,336
- They behind you?
- I hope so.

870
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:24,506
Go! Go!

871
01:26:34,255 --> 01:26:35,449
Casey!

872
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:38,187
Man down!

873
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:42,961
Move! Come on, move your ass!

874
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:02,406
- Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

875
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:04,075
They're with us!

876
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:19,059
Now! Lock it up! Lock it up!

877
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:38,977
Got it. I got it. He's not breathing.
Let's go. Get him breathing.

878
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:56,828
Sir?

879
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:05,878
Colonel O'Neill, care to explain?

880
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:11,245
We can use the stargate
to send these people home, sir.

881
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:14,384
What's he doing here?

882
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:24,659
General Hammond, this is Teal'c.
He can help us.

883
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:25,892
Do you know what he is?

884
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:29,494
Yes sir, I do.
He's the man who saved our lives.

885
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:35,502
And if you accept my recommendation, sir,
he'll join SG-1.

886
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:39,736
That decision may not be up to you.

887
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:42,308
Let's go, man down. Stand back!

888
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:45,682
Stand back!
All right, troop, get him off the ramp!

889
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:49,115
Let's get him off the ramp.

890
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:03,593
Colonel O'Neill, Major Kawalsky.

891
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:10,242
The sure-to-be-very-interesting debriefing
of SG units 1 and 2 will be at 0730.

892
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:12,641
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

893
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:19,278
All right, let's get these people situated.
This way.

894
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:31,595
She's out there somewhere, Jack.

895
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:34,758
I know. So's Skaara.

896
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:37,163
So what do we do?

897
01:29:39,407 --> 01:29:40,840
We find 'em.
