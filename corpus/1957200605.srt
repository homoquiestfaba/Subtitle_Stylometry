if I'm doing this right.

42
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,733
Should there be a
light on or something?

put it on there?

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,667
- [Boggs] Where
did it come from?

191
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,200
- [Robert] You got a bag, dude?

192
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:47,067
(grass crunching)

193
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,733
(mumbling)

194
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:57,900
- Who is that?

195
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:58,767
(static)

196
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,333
Guys...

197
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,200
(grass crunching)

198
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:08,933
- [Robert] He saw us, dude.

199
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:10,233
- [Jen] What is he doing?

200
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:11,067
What are we dong?

201
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,300
- [Boggs] Shut up.

202
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,233
- [Lisa] Derek,
what are we doing?

203
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:13,833
- [Boggs] Settle down, Beavis.

204
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:15,600
(static)

205
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:16,900
Berty, keep filming.

206
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,400
Everybody just play along.

207
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:19,900
(grass crunching)

208
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:20,867
- How you doing, man?

209
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,900
- [Boggs] Hey.

210
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:22,900
- Hello.

211
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:23,967
- Hi.

212
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
- Whew (laughing).

213
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:27,733
- We're just hanging out.

214
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:30,733
- You looking for something?

215
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:32,500
- Yeah, Lisa lost her dog.

216
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:33,367
[Lisa] Derek.

217
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,633
It's a little Shih Tzu,

218
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,667
a little moppy looking thing.

219
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,667
You seen him around, though?

220
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,500
- No.

221
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,867
Mrs. Conger just wanted to know

222
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,167
what you kids were
doing out here.

223
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,700
- Just hanging out.

224
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:48,633
- She doesn't like folks
on her property, and uh...

225
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:51,300
I told her I'd come out and see.

226
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,867
So, everything's okay, then?

227
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,133
- Yeah.

228
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:55,967
- Yep.

229
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:58,067
- Good lucking finding your pup.

230
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,367
Lisa...

231
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,967
- Yeah?

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,400
- That is the prettiest.

233
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:03,267
Elizabeth.

234
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:07,133
- [Robert] Have a good one, man.

235
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,567
- When you find your puppy,

236
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,833
you best be on your way, okay?

237
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:14,700
(dog barking)

238
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:15,933
- No problem.

239
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,800
(grass crunching)

240
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:20,800
(yelling) Hey, Poody!

241
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:21,633
Pooo!

242
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:22,500
Here, Poody!

243
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:26,133
(whistling)

244
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:28,967
(laughing)

245
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,300
- [Boggs] Freak show.

246
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,900
Bert. You get all that?

247
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:34,067
- [Berty] Yeah.

248
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,700
- [Boggs] Sweet.

249
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:40,733

(static)

251
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,233
- [Robert] Let's go, dude.

252
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:47,333
- [Jen] Get the fuck over here.

253
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:49,167
(birds chirping)

254
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,000
- [Robert] Quit fartin'
around over there.

255
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,767
- [Jen] Come on,
we're fuckin' leaving.

256
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,700
(rock music)

257
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,733
- [Boggs] (mumbling)
every once in awhile.

258
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,000
(mumbling)

259
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,933

00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,800
(engine rumbling)

261
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,233
- Hold on, I'll get you up.

262
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:09,933
- All right, right
foot, left foot.

263
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,500
Damn it.

264
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:12,900
Did you put grease on
these fucking trees?

265
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,467
We will defeat you!

266
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,733
(sighing)

267
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,600
- Oh, God.

268
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,567
(yelling)

269
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600

270
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:25,867
(mumbling)

271
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,200
- Double dog, fuck,

272
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:33,967
that's a single dog, dick head.

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,900
I'll do it.

274
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,867
(gasping)

275
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,833
(laughing)

276
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:42,133
(coughing)

277
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:45,000
(wheels spinning)

278
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,000
- [Robert] 'Bout time.

279
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:50,000
- [Jen] Shut up.

280
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:52,667
(door opening)

281
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,133
(footsteps pattering)

282
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,100
- Nice of your sister
to let you use her bike.

283
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:58,333
(laughing)

284
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:03,400
(engines rumbling)

285
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:09,500
[Man In White Shirt]
Oh yeah that's way big.

286
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:12,267
(engine revving)

287
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,267
- This fucking sucks.

288
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,367
Can we go?

289
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,200
(engine revving)

290
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,267
- [Boggs] Chello!

291
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,200
Hey!

292
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,100
- [Jen] God it's your boyfriend.

293
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:22,933
- Hey, Chello!

294
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:23,900
What's up, man?

295
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:24,867
Hey, Chello.

296
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:26,833
What's up, man?

297
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:27,700
- Hey, Salty.

298
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,767
[Boggs] Tiiigghhhtt.

299
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:32,867
- Like it?

300
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
- [Boggs] Hell yeah.

301
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,400
- Hop in, man.

302
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:37,700
- [Boggs] Oh, yeah, yeah.
It was a whole bunch of it.

303
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,667
We were just there.

304
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,700
We're going back tonight.

305
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,333
- Who told you about it?

306
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,933
- [Boggs] Remember Ezra?

307
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,233
- Ezra?

308
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:45,800
Ezra the fag?

309
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,033
(laughing)

310
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,467
I don't see a light.

311
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,400
- [Boggs] Oh yeah,
I put tape over it.

312
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:53,767
- [Cello] Is that Missy
Naughton's little sister?

313
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,567
- [Boggs] Yep.

314
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,567
- [Chello] Is that your woman?

315
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,200
- [Boggs] Yeah.

316
00:13:58,233 --> 00:13:59,167
- [Chello] Damn.

317
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,767
(laughing)

318
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,500
(lighter flicking)

319
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:06,733
(rock music)

320
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,967
You still play drums, Salty?

321
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,533
- [Boggs] Uh yeah,
I'm in a band.

322
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:13,000
(rock music)

323
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,233
- Cool.

324
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:18,633
- [Boggs] Yeah, we're
gonna start playing out

325
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,067
pretty soon, too.

326
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,933
- Well, if you need some
help getting rid of it, man,

327
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:31,867
just let me know.

328
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,600
I'll hook you up.

329
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:35,300
(engines revving)

330
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,400
- [Boggs] Yeah, cool.

331
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:37,433
Thanks, man.

332
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,000
- By Virginia Kendall

333
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:41,300
- [Boggs] Yeah, I guess.

334
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:43,767
Boston, I think?

335
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,467
Boston Town?

336
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,300
- Oh, Boston Mills.

337
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,333
(thunder rumbles)

338
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:49,267
Careful, dude.

339
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,333
- [Boggs] You been there?

340
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,067
- Eh, not for a couple years

341
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,067
but everybody's been there.

342
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,367
Million of stories
about Hell Town.

343
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,033
- [Boggs] What's that mean?

344
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,500
- Well, you aren't
gonna find it on any map

345
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,300
but that's what
everyone calls it.

346
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:08,567
Don't be caught in
the forest alone.

347
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,633
The trees and rocks
breathe on their own.

348
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,267
Spirits and murder,

349
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,967
the one-eyed hearse.

350
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,333
Boston Mills is a
town with a curse.

351
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:20,500
(laughing)

352
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:21,933
- [Boggs] You
making this shit up?

353
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,967
(thunder crackling)

354
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,100
- House in the woods,

355
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,567
a giggling ghost.

356
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,967
Survive the night to your
friends you will boast.

357
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,467
And if you see
Hattie's glowing gown,

358
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,000
you'll die alone in Hell Town.

359
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:43,267
Hell town.

360
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,900
Something like that.

361
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:47,233
I fucked it up.

362
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:48,667
- [Boggs] Shit.

363
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,900
- Yeah, your brother, man.

364
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:51,100
Me and him used to
go down in the woods

365
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:52,567
and scare the shit
out of all the chicks.

366
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,733
Drop 'em off in the woods

367
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:57,167
and show them the
haunted school bus

368
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,433
and tell them the story
about Hammer Hattie.

369
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,233
- [Boggs] Who's that?

370
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:04,767
- Hattie Fichtner.

371
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,133
Crazy ole bitch.

372
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,267
Story back in the
70's or something.

373
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,767
(thunder crackling)

374
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,733
And she used to hang all her
kids toys from the trees.

375
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:15,767
Hoping they'd come home.

376
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:21,033
Crazy bitch didn't even
know she killed 'em herself.

377
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,633
Crushed their
skulls with hammers.

378
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,733
Just punishment, or something.
- Shit.

379
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,633
Oh, fuck.

380
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:30,833
- Yeah.

381
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:34,267
Supposedly, it's
cursed ever since, man.

382
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,667
Like Rogue's Hollow,
Gore's Orphanage,

383
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,867
all that shit.

384
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:40,467
And make sure you take 'em up

385
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,067
and show 'em that church will
all those upside down crosses.

386
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,100
- [Boggs] So, what
about the school bus?

387
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:47,967
- Eh...

388
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,633
There's a whole bunch
of different versions

389
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:51,633
of that story

390
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:52,933
but basically,

391
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:55,233
there's a bus load of
kids out in the woods.

392
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:57,133
They get lured off the bus

393
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:59,333
and someone, or something,

394
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,433
murders 'em one at a time.

395
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:03,433
It was in the papers,

396
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:05,900
a whole bunch of stuff about it,

397
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:08,000
and I guess if you're
out there real late now,

398
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:10,533
you can still hear 'em crying.

399
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,033
- [Boggs] Uh yeah, kinda.

400
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,667
She was that girl
that ran away, right?

401
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,033
- Yeah.

402
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:20,267
You probably wouldn't
remember all the way

403
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,500
but they

404
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:23,833
found some of her
hair down there.

405
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:24,833
Don't get caught fucking around.

406
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,133
Cops are dicks.

407
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:28,367
(laughing)

408
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,633
- [Boggs] Is this bullshit?

409
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,867
- No, man.

410
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,200
There's this ghost
in the cemetery.

411
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:34,800
Can't find her grave,

412
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,800
wondering around all the time.

413
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,600
Yeah, you can look all this
shit up. It's all Hell Town.

414
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:41,400
Hell Town, Ohio.

415
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:43,100
hauntedohio.com.

416
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,233
You can see all this stuff.

417
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:47,267
And we used to go to crazy
house out in the woods.

418
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,467
Some people say it
was a funeral home.

419
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,033
It's on me, chief.

420
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,467
- [Boggs] Ah, thanks, dude.

421
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,567
- Yeah, you don't know
where you got it, though.

422
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,100
- [Boggs] Oh yeah,
don't know shit.

423
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,600
- Hey, have Tommy give
me a call, all right?

424
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:03,600
- [Boggs] Yeah.

425
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:04,600
Yeah, I will.

426
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:05,733
- All right.

427
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:06,700
Later, Salty
(thunder crackling).

428
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:07,867
(crickets chirping)

429
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,800
- Our mom's such a
bitch, dude (laughing).

430
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,300
Dude, Lisa, the other day, okay,

431
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:16,233
she comes home from school all
teared out (crying noises),

432
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:18,600
she got a B in history.

433
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:19,867
A fucking B.

434
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,500
God.

435
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,967
If I got a B in anything,

436
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,867
my mom would be doing nude
back flips in the front lawn.

437
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,533
I think she's in the kitchen.

438
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,933
You go get that one.

439
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:38,967
(crickets chirping)

440
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,033
(knocking)

441
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:47,233
(footsteps pattering)

442
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:52,700
One, two, three.

443
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,167
(screaming)

444
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,400
- Mom!

445
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:56,400
(laughing)

446
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,000
(door shutting)

447
00:18:58,033 --> 00:19:00,767
(footsteps pattering)

448
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,900
- She locked us out.

449
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,567
Come on (knocking).

450
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,433
(engine rumbling)

451
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,667
- [Boggs] Dude,
it's not over here.

452
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,900
- [Lisa] What are
you looking for?

453
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:18,433
- [Boggs] Nothing.

454
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,800
Which road did we turn on?

455
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,800
- [Robert] Can't remember.

456
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,967
(crickets chirping)

457
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,533
- [Lisa] I can't see anything.

458
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,933
- [Boggs] Turn on
the night vision.

459
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,467
- [Lisa] How do I do that?

460
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,833
- [Boggs] Here, give it to me.

461
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:30,700
There.

462
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:33,167
Is it green?

463
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,367
- [Lisa] Yeah.

464
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,167
Ew.

465
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,067
You look creepy.

466
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,500
- [Berty] Hello?

467
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,567
(crickets chirping)

468
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,967
- [Lisa] Don't
wander off, you guys.

469
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,900
This is how it always starts.

470
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:48,900
(laughing)

471
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:50,167
(mumbling)

472
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,400
- You scared the shit
out of me. (laughing)

473
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:53,067
- [Robert] I was like,
what a dick. (laughing)

474
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,533
- [Lisa] I hate you.

475
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,500
Oh, my God.

476
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:58,967
- [Robert] I think we go left.

477
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,033
- [Boggs] I'm pretty
sure it's right.

478
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,033
Wasn't there...

479
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,767
- [Lisa] Derek, it was left.

480
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,933
- [Boggs] No, there
was a building over
there, wasn't there?

481
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,033
- [Lisa] No, it was left.

482
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:06,300
- [Boggs] Fine, left.

483
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,767
Fucking don't care if
we're here all night.

484
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,633
(grass crunching)

485
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,267
(sighing)

486
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:18,900
(squeaking wheel sound)

487
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:21,933
- [Lisa] Hey guys,
wait up a little.

488
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:24,367
- [Robert] It's
off to the right,

489
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,167
when we were going
down here, right?

490
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,767
- [Berty] Did we pass it?

491
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,867
- I don't think so.

492
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,867
I can't remember.

493
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,033
- [Boggs] No, it was the left.

494
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:33,533
- [Robert] There were two lefts?

495
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,867
- No, that would've taken
us back towards the car.

496
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,200
- [Lisa] I don't know.

497
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:39,200
I have no idea.

498
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:42,033
(grass crunching)

499
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:45,200
- I mean, we marked it
real clear, didn't we?

500
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:48,433
- [Robert] Yeah, we'd
see it if we passed it.

501
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:50,167
I hear something.

502
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,433
Do you hear it?

503
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,733
(creaking)

504
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,733
- [Jen] What is that?

505
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:59,533
- [Robert] You have
the bag with you, man?

506
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:02,267
- Yeah, I've got it here but...

507
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,600
- [Robert] Just checking.

508
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:07,067
- [Lisa] You guys
don't see anything yet?

509
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:11,600
- Okay, it's one of these.

510
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:12,600
There's a little path up there

511
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:13,900
and there's one over here.

512
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:14,733
- [Lisa] Hey guys, wait.

513
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:15,633
- [Berty] Let's go.

514
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,567
- [Boggs] What?

515
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,533
- [Lisa] You guys, wait.

516
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,767
- [Boggs And Derek] What?

517
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,700
- [Lisa] Oh my God,
is that a person?

518
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:22,267
- That would be a tree, Lise.

519
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,467
- [Lisa] No, you guys.

520
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,867
You guys, there's somebody here.

521
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,233
- [Boggs] No, there's not, Lisa.

522
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:27,233
- [Lisa] Yes.

523
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:28,233
You guys.

524
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,233
- Lisa, stop fucking around.

525
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:30,367
- [Lisa] You guys, wait up.

526
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,900
You guys, wait.

527
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:33,833
- [Boggs And Robert] What?

528
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:34,967
- [Boggs] We're looking right
at the same place you are.

529
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,800
- [Lisa] You guys, we gotta go.

530
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,033
- You guys, wait up!

531
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:39,033
(laughing)

532
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:40,267
You guys!

533
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,100
- [Boggs] Lisa,
stop freaking out!

534
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:41,800
- [Lisa] You guys, wait!

535
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,067
(laughing)

536
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,767
- [Boggs] Watch
out for the tree!

537
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,467
- [Lisa] Wait!

538
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,633
(screaming)

539
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:46,667
- [Boggs] Lisa!

540
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,500
What...

541
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:48,367
(screaming)

542
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,200
(screaming)

543
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:51,000
Settle down!

544
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:52,500
- [Lisa] You guys, wait!

545
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,500
(static)

546
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:54,333
(gasping)

547
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:55,600
(camera drop thud)

548
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:57,700
(static)

549
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:04,133
(birds chirping)

550
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,733
- [Boggs] Well, it's
working fine now.

551
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:11,133
- What?

552
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,467
- [Boggs] Get up and
walk or something.

553
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,033
- Why?

554
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,833
- [Boggs] Just get up and walk.

555
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:20,667
(dog barking)

556
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,733
- [Boggs] Piece of poop.

557
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:27,867
- What's wrong with it?

558
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,500
(thudding)

559
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:31,867
- [Boggs] Awuga!

560
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,933
(laughing)

561
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:36,733
(thudding)

562
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:39,467
You think you can
handle that, sweetheart?

563
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:46,833
(thudding)

564
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,033
Punk kids!

565
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,867
Don't mess with the U.S. mail!

566
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,600
(laughing)

567
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:57,800
(laughing)

568
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,100
- [Robert] The internet.

569
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,400
- That chick, with snot
hanging out of her nose,

570
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:01,367
and shit.

571
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,533
- Yeah?

572
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:03,767
- I was just talking to Tanya.

573
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,067
She said those kids
are still missing.

574
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,400
(paper rustling)

575
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:10,567
- You can be in our video.

576
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,167
- [Jen] I don't think so.

577
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,767
- Yeah, in a tube top.

578
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:16,667
- So, what are
you reading there?

579
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,067
(papers rustling)

580
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,267
- [Jen] Jesus.

581
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:22,900
(groaning)

582
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:23,733
(smacking)

583
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:24,667
(smacking)

584
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,600
(smacking)

585
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:26,433
(smacking)

586
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:27,867
- Ow!

587
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,867
(smacking)

588
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,867
- [Boggs] Ow, fuck!

589
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,033
- [Robert] Kids.

590
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,267
- How can you stand him?

591
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,500
- [Boggs] There's no
place you can put that

592
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:36,300
where you know I
won't go after it.

593
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,500
Two, one, fire at will!

594
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:42,833
(eggs smashing)

595
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:43,867
There it is.

596
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,867
- [Lisa] I'm out of eggs.

597
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,133
(mumbling)

598
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,967
- [Boggs] Hey, so you guys
wanna hear something? His Mom...

599
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,200
- Hey, guess what.

600
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:58,167
They were playing
"Candy Man" in there.

601
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,167
- [Boggs] Oh, I'm sorry.

602
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,033
What, were you talking?

603
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,500
- Hi, how are you?

604
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:06,400
- [Boggs] So, his mom offered

605
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:11,433
to buy him brand spanking
new 1999 Ford Mustang GT.

606
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:13,933
- [Jen] Wow, Robert.

607
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:14,967
That's pretty cool.

608
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,800
- [Boggs] For free, too.

609
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,167
Doesn't have to do shit.

610
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,233
Said he didn't want it.

611
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:19,700
- Why?

612
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:21,667
- [Boggs] He's a
dicklick. I don't know,

613
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,000
he's keeping that piece of shit.

614
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:26,100
- Guys, look.

615
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,200
- [Boggs] Hey maybe we
should give your mom a ride.

616
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:36,333
(static)

617
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:42,200
(mumbling)

618
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:43,400
- [Boggs] Shut up, woman.

619
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:46,200
- [Jen] Don't tell
me to shut up.

620
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,567
- So, what is a...what was it?

621
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,900
Hosto?

622
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:51,133
- [Jen] It's a hostel, dumb ass.

623
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:52,567
- What the fuck's that?

624
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,533
- [Jen] It's like a cheap
hotel boarding house

625
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:55,900
where travelers stay.

626
00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:57,133
- [Robert] Yeah,
I've stayed in one.

627
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:58,433
- [Jen] They're everywhere.

628
00:24:58,467 --> 00:24:59,533
- [Lisa] When did
you stay in one?

629
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,200
- [Robert] Oh, Canada.

630
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,067
Thought you knew that.
You didn't know that?

631
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,000
- When the fuck
were you in Canada?

632
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,467
- Mother fucker!

633
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,300
- What's up, member
us, mother fuckers!...

634
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,633
- [Boggs] What did we do?

635
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,067
- You remember us, huh?

636
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,300
Gimme that camera!

637
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,700
[Boggs] Holy shit, go!

638
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:21,633
- [Boggs] Start the damn car!

639
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,267
Fuck you, man!

640
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,267
- [Robert] Where
did they come from?

641
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,533
- Holy shit.

642
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:31,233
What the fuck was their problem?

643
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,867
(honking)

644
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,300
(rock music)

645
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:44,700
- [Robert] Dick.

646
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:54,100
- [Jen] Ew, what is that?

647
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:56,067
- [Lisa] It's a statue.

648
00:25:57,633 --> 00:26:00,467
- [Bogggs] It's not a
statue, it's a dude.

649
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,233
(church bell ringing)

650
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:04,067
(groaning)

651
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,533
(car door opening)

652
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:07,567
- [Lisa] Oh.

653
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,800
- Dude, there was a kick
ass lookin' building

654
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,167
behind that church up there.

655
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,433
I can't really see
what's inside of it

656
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:15,433
but it looks totally sweet.

657
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:16,433
Come on, Berty.

658
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:17,267
You and me.

659
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,200
- [Berty] No.

660
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:19,267
- Ah dude, come on.

661
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,100
Double dog.

662
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:21,967
- [Berty] Take Robert.

663
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
- Fuck, I'm not taking Robert.

664
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:25,867
I'm taking you, timid Teddy.

665
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,400
(laughing)

666
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:28,400
- [Robert] Timid Teddy?

667
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:29,633
- [Jen] Triple dog?

668
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:30,467
- [Lisa] You guys
know what'll happen

669
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,600
if we get caught, right?

670
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:32,733
- [Jen] God'll get ya.

671
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,900
(laughing)

672
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:35,933
- [Lisa] Seriously, Derek.

673
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,000
It's a church.

674
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:39,067
- Shut up, Lise.

675
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
So come on, pussy lips.

676
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:41,333
You in?

677
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:42,600
(laughing)

678
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:43,633
- [Berty] All right.

679
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:44,833
- Yes.

680
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:49,733
Grab the flashlight,
dude (laughing).

681
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,433
- [Berty] Beep if anybody comes.

682
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:54,133
- You got it, Berty.

683
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,533
- [Berty] Seriously.

684
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:58,933
Somebody comes, I'll beep.

685
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:01,200
- [Boggs] Dude, and no
shenanigans while we're gone.

686
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:02,633
Give me the keys.

687
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:03,967
- [Berty] Beep three times,
like beep, beep, beep.

688
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,433
- Give me the keys.

689
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:06,333
Give me the fucking keys.

690
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:07,167
(keys jingling)

691
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,233
- Whatever, dude.

692
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:09,467
- [Boggs] That's right.

693
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,667
- [Jen] You guys want
some flashlights?

694
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,100
- [Boggs] Oh yeah,
give me those.

695
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,667
Here, Berty.

696
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,133
(footsteps pattering)

697
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:20,067
Just wait 'till
you see this thing.

698
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,900
Come on, Berty.

699
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,167
Let's go.

700
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,133
(grass crunching)
(insects buzzing)

701
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:38,300
- [Berty] I don't know, Boogs...

702
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:42,633
- [Boggs] What the fuck?

703
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,700
(thudding)

704
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:52,400
(flies buzzing)

705
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:01,567
Come on, Berty.

706
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:09,867
Whoa!

707
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,167
(thudding)

708
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,533
(laughing)

709
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:16,667
Damn, dude.

710
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,533
Here.

711
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,500
- [Berty] Let's go.

712
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:24,367
- Hang on, man.

713
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,567
(footsteps pattering)

714
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:39,300
(music box twinkling)

715
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,833
- [Berty] What's that?

716
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:44,933
(music box twinkling)

717
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:46,800
Boggs, can we just go?

718
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,033
- [Boggs] Hang on, man.

719
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:54,167
(footsteps pattering)

720
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,033
Who are you, Let's go, Larry.

721
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,800
(scraping)

722
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,200
(yelling)

723
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:04,233
It's just a mouse, dude.

724
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:07,400
- [Berty] Can we go?

725
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:09,067
Please.

726
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,267
- [Boggs] Oh man, we
should call the library.

727
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,367
See if there's a
reward for this one.

728
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,467
Oh dude, check these out.

729
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,633
(scraping)

730
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,600
I want one of these for my room.

731
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:19,367
Good citizen at school.

732
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,333
Obey school rules.

733
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:23,633
(mumbling)

734
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
- [Berty] Can we go?

735
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,967
- Hang on, dude.

736
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:31,400
- A good citizen
keeps good posture

737
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:34,133
when sitting,
standing, and walking.

738
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:36,133
These are hilarious.

739
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:39,133
Good citizen is fit and healthy

740
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:39,967
in mind and-

741
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,067
(car horn blowing)

742
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,500
- [Berty] What...

743
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,900
Come on, Boggs, let's go.

744
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,333
Who's that?

745
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,267
(creaking)

746
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,667
God, Boggs.

747
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,733
(creaking)

748
00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:58,833
(static)

749
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,600
(creaking)

750
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:11,100
- Dude, there's no
other way. (static)

751
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:11,933
(music box playing)

752
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:12,767
Dude, run!

753
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,967
(footsteps pattering)

754
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,567
Come on, Berty.

755
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,267
- [Berty] I'm come...

756
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,733
(footsteps pattering)

757
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:25,633
(coughing)

758
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:26,900
Where are they?

759
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:30,167
- [Boggs] What are
you talking about?

760
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,333
- [Boggs] What the hell?

761
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:34,667
(footsteps pattering)

762
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,733
- [Boggs] Where
the fuck are they?

763
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:39,400
(engine starting)

764
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:40,400
Oh!

765
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:41,867
Those fuckers.

766
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,200
It was them.

767
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:44,033
God.

768
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:48,367
(laughing)

769
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,767
- I wish I had a camera
right now. (laughing)

770
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,033
- [Boggs] You bastards.

771
00:30:54,067 --> 00:30:55,667
Which one of you
guys was up there?

772
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,733
(puking)

773
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,233
- [Boggs] Wait, check it out.

774
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:04,100
Hey, Lise.

775
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:06,733
Mom's making some
Salisbury steak

776
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:09,500
and thick gravy for dinner.

777
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,967
(puking)

778
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,367
(laughing)

779
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,567
Every time.

780
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,667
(static)

781
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,567
(thudding)

782
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,200
[Robert] All right,
Berty. Phone.

783
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:26,067
- All right, be quiet.

784
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,333
Uh, yeah.

785
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:39,533
Yeah, could I have a four
dick salad sandwiches

786
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:41,800
with some extra butt sauce?

787
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:48,033
(laughing)

788
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,067
Hey dude, I gotta stay
at your house tonight.

789
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,100
- Yeah, cool.

790
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:53,700
- All right.

791
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:55,067
- Bitch.

792
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,433
- Your bitch.

793
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:58,667
(laughing)

794
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,600
- [Robert] Probably just a
dirty filter or something.

795
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:04,700
Or bad spark plugs, maybe.

796
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:07,200
- Yeah, or it's a
big piece of poop.

797
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:10,400
(footsteps pattering)

798
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,700
- [Robert] All right, I'll film.

799
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:16,900
- Ah, no shit.

800
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,500
(door creaking)

801
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,333
(door unlocking)

802
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:48,100
(door shutting)

803
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,967
(stairs creaking)

804
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:26,767
(low television sound)

805
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:40,900
(thudding)

806
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:49,367
Hit the switch.

807
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:56,067
(switch flipping)

808
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,900
(siren)

809
00:33:58,933 --> 00:33:59,767
(Hey, good mornin', Berty)
(laughing)

810
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,700
(siren continues)

811
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:03,500
[Berty] Get outta here!

812
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:06,333
(siren continues)

813
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,567
We'll be outside, Berty.

814
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,400
Get outta here!

815
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:11,667
We'll be just outside.

816
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,067
- [Berty] Get out of here!

817
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,067
(laughing)

818
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,700
- Did you get that?

819
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,333
(knocking)

820
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:27,900
- What?

821
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,333
Hi, bitch.

822
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:31,767
- [Boggs] What's up, slut?
- Nice to see you (kissing).

823
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,367
Get out of here.

824
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,633
Get out, you're too
close (laughing).

825
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:35,867
- Just wait 'till
you guys see this.

826
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,967
- What happened?

827
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
- [Boggs] It's awesome.

828
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:39,000
- [Lisa] What happened?

829
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:40,000
- Boggs, shut up.

830
00:34:40,033 --> 00:34:43,733
(footsteps pattering)

831
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:44,933
- Whoa, sweet.

832
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,300
(mumbling in background)

833
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:52,100
Berty, why don't you
pull you socks up?

834
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:53,467
Pull those up, man.

835
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,433
You'll look cool, you'll
be like my grandpa.

836
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:57,633
(clanging)
(yelling)

837
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:59,200
- [Boggs] Are you okay there...

838
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:00,467
- Why did I listen to you?

839
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
Ow (laughing).

840
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,500
- [Boggs] There's a very...

841
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,733
- Yeah.

842
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:04,967
- [Boggs] All right.

843
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,167
- I've never tried a
threesome before, so...

844
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,567
- [Boggs] Rob,
she said she's in.

845
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,400
Uh, I don't know what
you're taking about.

846
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:11,467
- [Boggs] Bullshit.

847
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
- We were talking about you.

848
00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:14,767
- [Boggs] That's
what I'm thinking.

849
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,967
What the fuck are
you talking about?

850
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,900
- We're just talking
about like what

851
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:19,233
a fucking dumb ass you are.

852
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:20,600
- [Boggs] Uh-huh.

853
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:25,100
- Can we do stuff that
normal teens do, like
just...smoke pot and drink..

854
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:26,367
- [Boggs] Fuck
normal teens, man.

855
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,467
You don't have to be
part of the system.

856
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,700
(laughing)

857
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:32,967
- [Robert] Down
with the machine.

858
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,533
- Lisa has a huge
crush on Robert.

859
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,433
- [Lisa] Shut up.

860
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,533
- [Boggs] Who can blame her?

861
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:38,800
He's pretty.
- I know.

862
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:39,800
(laughing)

863
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,133
Are you attracted to him?

864
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:42,333
For real.

865
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:43,567
- [Boggs] What?

866
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,900
- Do you like Robert?

867
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:46,400
(laughing)

868
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:47,500
If I ever leave you,

869
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:48,833
I'm going right over there.

870
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:50,833
- [Boggs] Oh, I don't
blame ya. (laughing)

871
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:52,100
You ever break my heart,

872
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:53,133
he's gonna be there
to pick those pieces

873
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:54,667
right back up.
- Oh, yeah.

874
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,167
- [Boggs] Berty,

875
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,367
even though you can't hear me

876
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,200
'cause you're
always off in that,

877
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:01,567
spaced out, fucked up little
Berty world of yours...

878
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,367
- [Robert] He hotter
than you. (laughing)

879
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,600
- [Boggs] I love you.

880
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:07,667
You dirty little
piece of man whore.

881
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,667
I love you.

882
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,867
(laughing)

883
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,367
I knew you didn't
have those things on!

884
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,367
I knew it!

885
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,367
(laughing)

886
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,367
Ah!

887
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,800
(rock music)

888
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:24,633
- [Boggs] Oh, that is awesome.

889
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:31,667
- [Robert] Let's
fucking go, man.

890
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,200
- [Boggs] Look, it's them.

891
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,400
- No, it's not.

892
00:36:35,433 --> 00:36:36,700
- [Boggs] Who the
fuck else drives that?

893
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:37,533
(laughing)

894
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:38,467
- [Lisa] Really.

895
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,633
[Robert] Everybody's got one.

896
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,400
Dude, cut it, cut it!

897
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:45,667
(clanking)

898
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,933
- [Boggs] Give me one
of those. (mumbling)

899
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:49,400
- [Jen] Oh, shit.

900
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:51,000
- [Boggs] Shit, (mumbling)

901
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:52,500
(door opening)

902
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:55,033
(can shaking)

903
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:58,500
- [Lisa] Oh my god...

904
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:04,000
(laughing)

905
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:05,633
- [Robert] He's so dumb.

906
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:11,600
(yelling)
(laughing)

907
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:12,600
What the fuck you doing?

908
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:16,967
(laughing)
(mumbling)

909
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,367
- [Jen] What's he doing?

910
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,133
- [Boggs] I don't know.

911
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:27,667
- [Boggs] Who the fuck is that?

912
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,533
Ahem!

913
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,633
Ahem.

914
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,733
(coughing)

915
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:34,100
- [Robert] You okay?

916
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:35,600
- [Boggs] Everybody cough fake.

917
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,500
(coughing)

918
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:38,833
Creep.

919
00:37:38,867 --> 00:37:40,700
(coughing)

920
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:41,567
- MTV?

921
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,233
- [Boggs] Yeah.

922
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:45,500
Well, why not?

923
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:46,833
- 'Cause there's two
members of your band

924
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:48,733
and they both suck.

925
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,200
- [Robert] Whoa (laughing).

926
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:51,433
- [Boggs] What are
you talking about?

927
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:52,900
We're the hot new duo
on the music scene.

928
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:53,900
Ain't that right, Bobby?

929
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:55,433
- Right.

930
00:37:55,467 --> 00:37:56,567
- Why don't you want a new car?

931
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,667
- I don't know.

932
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,933
- It's free.

933
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:00,267
- I don't know, maybe
it's more fun parking

934
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,733
that piece of shit
in her driveway.

935
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:02,767
(laughing)

936
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,767
- Guys.

937
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,767
- What?

938
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,733
- [Berty Who is that?

939
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:11,167
- [Boggs] Check out that hat.

940
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:15,333
- [Lisa] Don't.

941
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:17,067
- Fine.

942
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,333
- [Lisa] Oh, shit.

943
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:21,333
Go!

944
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:24,333
(footsteps pattering)

945
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:25,533
- Didn't I tell you?

946
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:27,767
His little boyfriend, I knew it.

947
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,433
- [Lisa] What else does it say?

948
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:31,533
- [Jen] Haunted Ohio.

949
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,467
Are you fucking kidding me?

950
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,167
Read It, It's Cool!

951
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,533
- [Jen] Oh, that's fascinating.

952
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,367
- Hearse, haunted school bus.

953
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,567
Satanic church.

954
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,900
The church with some
upside down cross on it

955
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:44,967
- The highway to hell.

956
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,400
The crazy house in the woods.

957
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:51,933
No wonder we're here
every fucking day.

958
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:54,267
(yelling)

959
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,267
Gimme it.

960
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,533
(laughing)

961
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,867
- [Jen] I wasn't
done reading them.

962
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,933
- [Boggs] Fucking wrestlers.

963
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:04,933
Oh.

964
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:05,800
Ah.

965
00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:09,133
- Highway to hell.

966
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,200
Crazy house in the woods again.

967
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:12,333
- I can't hold him any longer.

968
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,100
- Can we go to the
satanic church?

969
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:15,767
(groaning)

970
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,467
(laughing)

971
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,633
Get off.

972
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:20,633
Get off.

973
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:22,633
(laughing)

974
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:23,933
Wait, I wanna go to the church

975
00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:25,933
with the upside down cross.

976
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:26,933
- I don't know.

977
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:28,167
Maybe he owns this land.

978
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,400
- He owns a state park?

979
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:33,400
- Maybe he works for
the park service?

980
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:34,467
(thudding)

981
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,467
- [Boggs] Ow!

982
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,133
Ah, mother fucker.

983
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,133
- [Berty] You okay?

984
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,967
- [Boggs] Ah, damn it.

985
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,500
The fuck was that?

986
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,600
- [Jen] You are bleeding.

987
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,167
Oh, God.

988
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:52,633
- [Boggs] Is it bad?

989
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:53,700
- [Jen] Yeah.

990
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:56,000
[Robert] It doesn't look good.

991
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:57,500
- [Boggs] Oh, shit.

992
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:58,967
- [Jen] You're gonna need
like stitches or something.

993
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,333
- [Boggs] Don't
worry about it, here.

994
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,200
Gross.

995
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:05,267
(laughing)

996
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,500
Hey, I'm bleeding.

997
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:07,500
You can't...

998
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:08,867
(laughing)

999
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,667
[Robert] Make it
bleed a little worse.

1000
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,900
- [Robert] Dude,
dude, get off me.

1001
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:12,900
You're bleeding
on me (laughing).

1002
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:14,500
- Ow.

1003
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:16,067
(thudding)

1004
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,633
- [Berty] Derek
Boggman will do it.

1005
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:18,933
(door shutting)

1006
00:40:18,967 --> 00:40:21,133
[Boggs] Come on, Lis.

1007
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:22,567
(door creaking)

1008
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,733
[Lisa] This is not a good idea.

1009
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:24,567
- [Boggs] Yes.

1010
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,500
Come on, girls.

1011
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:28,367
Destiny awaits. Get up there.

1012
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,467
- [Robert] All right,
get down, dude.

1013
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,967
Berty, get down.

1014
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,033
- [Boggs] We don't want that
fro of yours sticking out.

1015
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:37,000
- [Robert] Hurry up!

1016
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:39,200
(laughing)

1017
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:42,433
- [Boggs] My grandma walks
faster that them, geez.

1018
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:47,667
Just do it.

1019
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:53,633
- [Robert] Dude,
you stink, dude.

1020
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,400
- [Boggs] Uh no, that's Berty.

1021
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:56,767
- [Robert] Berty, you stink.

1022
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,367
(laughing)

1023
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,600
(knocking)

1024
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:03,800
- The hell are they waiting for?

1025
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:06,200
- [Boggs] What are they
still doing? Come back here!

1026
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:07,233
(laughing)

1027
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:08,067
(footsteps pattering)

1028
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,500
Fucking amateurs.

1029
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,367
Get down.

1030
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:15,367
- [Boggs] Wait a second.

1031
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,600
- [Lisa] Can we go home now?

1032
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:17,600
- [Boggs] No.

1033
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:18,567
Lisa, shut the fuck up.

1034
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
- [Robert] Come on, grandpa.

1035
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:21,433
Where you at?

1036
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:22,467
- [Robert] Dude, let's go.

1037
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,000
We're going in.

1038
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:25,600
(mumbling)

1039
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:26,467
Shh.

1040
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,533
- [Boggs] I saw something.

1041
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:34,967
- [Robert] Where?

1042
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:38,667
Ewww.

1043
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,000
- [Boggs] What?

1044
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:41,000
Go back and...

1045
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:42,533
Go, go!

1046
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:45,433
(mumbling)

1047
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:47,367
- [Robert] What the...

1048
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
- [Boggs] Whoa.

1049
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:49,567
What the fuck?

1050
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,500
(opera music)

1051
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:52,333
(door bell ringing)

1052
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,400
- [Robert] Dude, they're
just standing there.

1053
00:41:57,433 --> 00:42:00,633
- [Boggs] What's the
deaf duo's problem?

1054
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:04,100
(mumbling)
(laughing)

1055
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:07,033
Let's go, dude.

1056
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,867
No one's answering.

1057
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,700
Yeah, we know.

1058
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:13,667
Let's go.

1059
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,600
- [Boggs] Whatever.

1060
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:19,800
(footsteps pattering)

1061
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,133
Dude, what are you...

1062
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:23,167
Dude, don't.

1063
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,500
- [Boggs] There's one.

1064
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:28,500
(glass breaking)

1065
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:29,500
- [Robert] Oh, my God.

1066
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:34,033
(mumbling)
(laughing)

1067
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,800
- [Boggs] That was it.

1068
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:38,800
We gotta go!

1069
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:40,100
(door opening)

1070
00:42:40,133 --> 00:42:41,133
(door closing)

1071
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:43,900
(rock music)

1072
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:46,067
There he is.

1073
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,100
Don't wreck.

1074
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,167
(door opening)

1075
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:57,567
Woo!

1076
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,400
Hey, Berty!

1077
00:42:58,433 --> 00:43:00,533
How you like that?

1078
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:02,033
What's Deaf Danny's problem?

1079
00:43:02,067 --> 00:43:04,367
(car honking)

1080
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,567
Woo-hoo (clapping)!

1081
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,200
How you like that, Berty?

1082
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:08,233
Yeah, I know your mom does.

1083
00:43:08,267 --> 00:43:09,367
Hey!

1084
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,800
Go dude, go.

1085
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,633
Later, Berty.

1086
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:15,100
(door closing)

1087
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:17,733
(laughing)

1088
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:19,000
Watch the road!

1089
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:28,367
- [Boggs] Holy shit, dude.

1090
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,433
- Ahh.

1091
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:35,533
- [Boggs] Holy shit.

1092
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:37,400
Nice job there, Berty.

1093
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:39,633
Beautiful.

1094
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:40,533
(laughing)

1095
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:41,367
- [Jen] No.

1096
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,200
Didn't sound...

1097
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:43,133
(coughing)

1098
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:44,067
- [Boggs] That's his sister.

1099
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,533
(rock music)

1100
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:54,200
Yeah.

1101
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:56,500
Hey!

1102
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,500
Hey, dude!

1103
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:03,300
What's up, man?

1104
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:11,567
What are you..

1105
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:15,633

1106
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:19,500

1107
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:21,967
(rock music)

1108
00:44:23,067 --> 00:44:24,233
- [Lisa] Oh, that's
how it works.

1109
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:27,367
That's cool, it
just occurred to me.

1110
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,067
- You don't remember that?

1111
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,633
Thought you knew that.

1112
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:32,467
- Oh, shit.

1113
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,967
Here we go.

1114
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,333
- Dead serious, dude.

1115
00:44:36,367 --> 00:44:38,833
- Yeah, so there were
like five of 'em.

1116
00:44:38,867 --> 00:44:40,500
You don't even remember
how many guys jumped you?

1117
00:44:40,533 --> 00:44:41,367
- Nope.

1118
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:44,933
It all happened so fast.

1119
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:46,233
- Oh, it all happened so fast.

1120
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,233
- [Robert] Shut up, man.

1121
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,433
(laughing)

1122
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:49,967
I'll bet you kicked
all their asses though,

1123
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,967
didn't you?

1124
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,333
- Hey, I'm still here, ya know.

1125
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:54,200
- Yep.

1126
00:44:56,267 --> 00:44:58,233
(coughing)

1127
00:44:58,267 --> 00:45:00,600
Just like Canada, too, huh?

1128
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:02,233
(laughing)

1129
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,633
So, what part of Canada
were you in again?

1130
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:05,633
- I don't remember.

1131
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:07,200
- [Boggs] Mmm.

1132
00:45:07,233 --> 00:45:08,567
- Montreal, I think.

1133
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,700
(coughing)

1134
00:45:09,733 --> 00:45:11,300

(coughing)

1136
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,767

(coughing)

1138
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,467
- So, you see any action
up there? (coughing)

1139
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:23,700
I think it's weird that you
went on a trip to Canada

1140
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:24,700
a couple years ago,

1141
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:25,733

1142
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:27,000
your closest and
dearest friends,

1143
00:45:27,033 --> 00:45:28,200

(laughing)

1148

1258
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,433
- We're doing a
report for school

1259
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:51,633
and I was wondering if I
can ask you some questions

1260
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:53,800
about the Boston Mills area?

1261
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:55,833
- [Waitress] Sure.

1262
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,167

was it founded?

00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,033
- Um...

1264
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:02,600
1806, I believe.

1265
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,067
Right, Ray ?

1266
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:05,933
- 1806.

1267
00:50:07,233 --> 00:50:09,067
Oldest village in Summit County.

1268
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,533
Used to be a mill town.

1269
00:50:10,567 --> 00:50:12,033
A paper mill.

1270
00:50:12,067 --> 00:50:14,567
- [Boggs] Oh, are there
still paper mills?

1271
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,267
- [Ray] No, son.

1272
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,000
They've been gone
for some time now.

1273
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:22,433
Norm here, he can tell
you just about anything

1274
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:25,000

1277
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,933
- He's doing a paper
for Civics class.

1278
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:31,867
- [Norm] Okay.

1279
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,033
- His brother, Kenny,
worked at the mills.

1280
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:36,633
Give 'em a little lesson, Norm.

1281
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,500
- Well, built the
first mill in 1820

1282
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:42,000
and the railroad
came through Boston

1283
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:43,967
at around 1880.

1284
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,367
Town flourished for years.

1285
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,200
But by the...

1286
00:50:47,233 --> 00:50:48,467
- [Boggs] Yeah, that's
not really interesting

1287
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,700
but why do they call
it Hell Town, Ray?

1288
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:53,800
(static)

1289
00:50:57,467 --> 00:51:00,733
- [Waitress] So, that's
what this is all about?

1290
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:05,100
- [Boggs] Oh, well I was
just wondering, ma'am.

1291
00:51:05,133 --> 00:51:07,967
- Well, it is the
seventh of June.

1292
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:10,167
- [Boggs] Okay.

1293
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:15,233
- [Ray] Isn't school
out for the summer, son?

1294
00:51:15,267 --> 00:51:16,367
- [Boggs] Well, um...

1295
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,467
(static)

1296
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,533
- Need a refill?

1297
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,100
You always like it topped off.

1298
00:51:28,067 --> 00:51:29,500
Hey, Norm.

1299
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:30,333
Norm, you okay?

1300
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:31,167
(door creaking)

1301
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,000
(mumbling)

1302
00:51:32,033 --> 00:51:33,000
- [Boggs] Yeah, sure.

1303
00:51:33,033 --> 00:51:33,900
(gasping)

1304
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:35,867
(static)

1305
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,300
Gotta get back in the studio.

1306
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:38,867
- Oh, shut up.

1307
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,333
(laughing)

1308
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:41,600
- [Boggs] You should
join our band.

1309
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:43,267
Yeah, do backup.

1310
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,500
- [Lisa] Okay, Derek.

1311
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:45,700
- Backup?

1312
00:51:45,733 --> 00:51:47,167
You guys don't
even have a singer.

1313
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,100
(laughing)

1314
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:50,533
- [Boggs] We're so good we
don't even need a singer.

1315
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,133
Just drums and guitar.

1316
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:53,467
- [Jen] Oh, God.

1317
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:57,600
- [Boggs] I'm serious, Lisa.

1318
00:51:57,633 --> 00:51:59,800
I mean, dad told me you
rock on the skin flute.

1319
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:00,633
(laughing)

1320
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:01,367
Yeah, you can play that.

1321
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,567
- Ha, ha.

1322
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,300
- [Boggs] Here he
comes, here he comes.

1323
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,567
(mumbling)

1324
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:11,467
- Uh-oh.

1325
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,467
(laughing)

1326
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,533
Uh-oh.

1327
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:14,767
(laughing)

1328
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,967
(sighing)

1329
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:21,033
- [Boggs] Oh, sorry, Cappy.

1330
00:52:21,067 --> 00:52:23,333
(laughing)

1331
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:27,533
Hippy trash

1332
00:52:27,567 --> 00:52:30,267
(laughing)

1334
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,400
- Dirty bird, got your ears on?

(beeping)

1336
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:35,800
- [Dirty Bird] This is Bird.

1337

(beeping)
(static)

1338
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:39,033
- We got a problem here.

1339
00:52:39,067 --> 00:52:40,367
Bus lost a fucking wheel.

1340
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,633
(static)
(beeping)

1341
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:42,667
- [Dirty Bird] You
still at the diner?

1342
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,033
- Uh, what do you think?

1343
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:48,333
(static)
(beeping)

1344
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,867
- [Berty] Should we just go?

1345
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,867
- [Boggs] No way.

1346
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,133
(laughing)

1347
00:52:57,033 --> 00:52:58,933
- [Robert] Holy shit.

1348
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,733
- [Jen] Is that that lady

1349
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:01,500
from the woods?
- We are fucked.

1350
00:53:01,533 --> 00:53:02,533
- [Robert] Yeah.

1351
00:53:02,567 --> 00:53:03,733
- [Berty] Yeah, hold on.

1352
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:04,833
Let's just see.

1353
00:53:04,867 --> 00:53:06,167
- [Robert] Easy, easy.

1354
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,700
(engine starting)

1355
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:10,333
- [Boggs] Too loud.

1356
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,267
- [Lisa] Oh, my God.

1357
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,300
Oh, my God.

1358
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:18,067
(laughing)

1359
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,067
- [Boggs] Oh shit, Robert.

1360
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,067
(laughing)

1361
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,100
Look at him go.

1362
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:23,033
(screaming)

1363
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:24,233
- [Robert] We've
been driving forever.

1364
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,400
- [Boggs] Just keep going, man.

1365
00:53:25,433 --> 00:53:26,767
Wait, there's trucks.

1366
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,067
(mumbling)

1367
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,100
- [Robert] By the truck?

1368
00:53:29,133 --> 00:53:30,533
- [Boggs] Yeah.

1369
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:33,100
It should be up here. Wait,
no, there it is, whoa.

1370
00:53:33,133 --> 00:53:35,300
Back up, back up, back up.

1371
00:53:37,533 --> 00:53:40,167
- [Jen] There's
no people in that.

1372
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,367
- [Boggs] Well, there
was on the tape.

1373
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,667
Hey, Jen.

1374
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,500
Double dog.

1375
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:48,300
- [Jen] What?

1376
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:49,533
- Go see if there's
anybody inside.

1377
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:51,000
- [Jen] See what?

1378
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,500
- Go see if there's
anyone inside.

1379
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:56,033
Come on, no, okay.

1380
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:58,267
You have to take, okay,

1381
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,333
yeah, you've gotta go
and sit in the last seat

1382
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:03,533
for a whole minute,

1383
00:54:03,567 --> 00:54:07,200
with the camera
and the flashlight.

1384
00:54:07,233 --> 00:54:08,300
- [Jen] Okay.

1385
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,833
- Here you go, toots.

1386
00:54:11,867 --> 00:54:12,967
- [Jen] Okay.

1387
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,633
- Remember, we'll
beep three times right

1388
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:17,833
before minute's up,

1389
00:54:17,867 --> 00:54:19,133
or whatever.

1390
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:20,667
- [Jen] Okay.

1391
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,867
- Just be careful out there...

1392
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,867
(gasping)

1393
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,867
- [Jen] Derek!

1394
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:27,833
(laughing)
(clapping)

1395
00:54:27,867 --> 00:54:29,400
- [Boggs] Okay, sweet ass.

1396
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:30,400
Get out there.

1397
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,767
- [Jen] Okay.

1398
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,300
No, turn them on.

1399
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,133
(gasping)

1400
00:54:34,167 --> 00:54:35,500
- [Robert] Pussy.

1401
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:36,667
- [Jen] Shut up.

1402
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,967
Fucker.

1403
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,367
- [Boggs] Hey, got
get 'em, killer.

1404
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,533
(footsteps pattering)

1405
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:42,633
- [Jen] Oh, my God.

1406
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:45,833
(footsteps pattering)

1407
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,833
Oh, my God.

1408
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:03,567
(thudding)

1409
00:55:09,767 --> 00:55:11,200
There's no one in here.

1410
00:55:11,233 --> 00:55:14,400
(footsteps pattering)

1411
00:55:28,467 --> 00:55:30,700
(slamming)

1412
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:37,467
I can't open it!

1413
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,767
- [Boggs] What?

1414
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:40,733
(thudding)

1415
00:55:40,767 --> 00:55:41,567

1416
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,400
(thudding)

1417
00:55:42,433 --> 00:55:43,633

1418
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:46,333
(screaming)

1419
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:47,333
- [Boggs] Jen, you okay?

1420
00:55:47,367 --> 00:55:48,367
(screaming)

1421
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,933
- [Jen] Oh, my God.

1422
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:50,933
- [Boggs] Where's the...

1423
00:55:50,967 --> 00:55:51,933
Damn it, Jen!

1424
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:54,933
(grass crunching)

1425
00:55:54,967 --> 00:55:57,300
(scuffling)

1426
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,400
Damn it, Jen.

1427
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:03,600
(sighing)

1428
00:56:13,633 --> 00:56:15,900
Who'd she see?

1429
00:56:17,533 --> 00:56:18,933
Jen, don't drop
my fucking camera.

1430
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:20,400
- [Jen] Oh, my God
there's someone in there.

1431
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:22,233
- [Boggs] Can you be more
careful with my shit?

1432
00:56:22,267 --> 00:56:24,867
- [Jen] Derek, there's
someone in there.

1433
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,733
- [Boggs] Bullshit. You just
said that a little while ago.

1434
00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:28,767
There's nobody in there.

1435
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,600
Don't worry about it.

1436
00:56:29,633 --> 00:56:30,867
- I saw someone.

1437
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,233
I didn't see you wasting
any time either, Derek.

1438
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:33,767
- [Lisa] Yeah, Derek.

1439
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,800
- [Boggs] I was just
worried about my camera.

1440
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,233
- [Robert] We'll watch
it when we get home.

1441
00:56:37,267 --> 00:56:39,767
(can shaking)

1442
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,967
(spray paint spraying)

1443
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:49,100
- [Robert] Dude.

1444
00:56:49,133 --> 00:56:50,633
Dude, we gotta go.

1445
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:51,600
There's somebody out here.
- [Jen] Come on, you guys.

1446
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:52,833
Let's go.

1447
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:53,900
- [Lisa] Derek, we're
gonna be in trouble.

1448
00:56:53,933 --> 00:56:55,233
- [Boggs] Check that shit up.

1449
00:56:55,267 --> 00:56:56,633
- [Robert] Dude,
nice, we gotta go.

1450
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,133
- Okay.

1451
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:00,700
You know, sometimes, I just
don't know why we don't

1452
00:57:00,733 --> 00:57:02,533
leave your dead ass home.

1453
00:57:02,567 --> 00:57:04,800
- [Jen] Double dog?

1454
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,267
- [Boggs] Me.

1455
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,000
- [Jen] I dare you to
see if anyone's sleeping

1456
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:09,567
in that van.

1457
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,000
- [Boggs] Fuck, Lisa'd do that.

1458
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:12,267
- [Lisa] Oh, okay.

1459
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,233
- [Robert] Dude, you
took the dare, man.

1460
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:14,233
- [Boggs] Just pull up here.

1461
00:57:14,267 --> 00:57:15,600
- [Robert] Okay.

1462
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:17,533
- [Boggs] Give me that light.

1463
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,533
Where is it?

1464
00:57:18,567 --> 00:57:19,900
All right, dude.

1465
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:22,300
Get ready to punch it.

1466
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:25,133
- [Jen] Oh, you're not
getting out of the car, pussy?

1467
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:27,433
- [Boggs] Shut the fuck up.

1468
00:57:28,633 --> 00:57:29,633
- [Robert] Turn it on.

1469
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:30,467
- [Boggs] There it is.

1470
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,867
- [Robert] Okay.

1471
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,067
(howling)

1472
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:36,067
Wake up, ya hippies!

1473
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:36,900

1474
00:57:36,933 --> 00:57:38,100

1475
00:57:38,133 --> 00:57:39,367
Where are you, dirty bastards?

1476
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,800
(laughing)

1477
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,900

1478
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:45,200
Whoa.

1479
00:57:45,233 --> 00:57:46,200
- [Lisa] Robert.

1480
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:47,167
- [Boggs] God damn it.

1481
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,200
- [Lisa] Robert?

1482
00:57:48,233 --> 00:57:50,567
(whooshing)

1483
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:52,700
- [Boggs] Come on, Betty.

1484
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:53,967
- [Jen] Robert, are
you fucking around?

1485
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,767
[Robert] Probably
that stupid light.

1486
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,933
- [Lisa] Who is that?

1487
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,167
- [Boggs] Come one, Betty.

1488
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,333
Robert come turn
the fucking car on.

1489
00:57:58,367 --> 00:57:59,533
- [Jen] What is that?

1490
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:00,633
- [Lisa] Go!

1491
00:58:00,667 --> 00:58:02,400

1492
00:58:02,433 --> 00:58:05,600
(footsteps pattering)

1493
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,333
- I'm just gonna go on ahead.

1494
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:15,333
- [Jen] Okay.

1495
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,900
(footsteps pattering)

1496
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:19,600
Oh, gross.

1497
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,433
That's disgusting.

1498
00:58:22,467 --> 00:58:23,367
Later, dudes!

1499
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,167
(laughing)

1500
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,500

1501
00:58:26,533 --> 00:58:27,733

1503
00:58:28,767 --> 00:58:29,733

1505
00:58:31,233 --> 00:58:33,867
(laughing)

1506
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,033
- [Jen] All right, uh-uh,
you guys are so cool.

1507
00:58:36,067 --> 00:58:37,467
I'm leaving.

1508
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,533
- [Boggs] Hey, where you going?

1509
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:40,800
- [Jen] Bye.

1510
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:43,033
I'm leaving. (Get
back here, woman.)

1511
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:45,267
- [Boggs] That's right,
you come back here.

1512
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,300
- [Jen] See ya.

1513
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,000
(mumbling in background)

1514
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:49,100
Bye.

1515
00:58:49,133 --> 00:58:50,900
Come back with my camera!

1516
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:55,767
(screaming)

1517
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,800
- Holy fuck.

1518
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,167
You fucking cunt.

1519
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,000
Come here (laughing).

1520
00:59:02,033 --> 00:59:03,333
She threw up again.

1521
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:06,767
(mumbling in background)

1522
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,900
- [Boggs] Hey, Lise.

1523
00:59:15,933 --> 00:59:18,200
(laughing)

1524
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:22,900
- What the fuck?

1525
00:59:22,933 --> 00:59:23,967
- [Boggs] Huh?

1526
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:26,033
Oh, no way.

1527
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,900
- [Berty] We didn't park there.

1528
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:31,133
- No shit.

1529
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,633
We came in over here
and parked there.

1530
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:35,433
(grass rustling)

1531
00:59:39,733 --> 00:59:43,100
- [Robert] Give them more
than a flat tire. (laughing)

1532
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,167
(lighter flicking)

1533
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,000
- I don't think
it's funny anymore.

1534
00:59:49,033 --> 00:59:51,100
- Maybe they're deaf.

1535
00:59:51,133 --> 00:59:52,133
(laughing)

1536
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:53,667
- [Boggs] Yeah, deaf retards.

1537
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,433
- No, twin deaf retards.

1538
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:57,700
- When I looked
through that window,

1539
00:59:57,733 --> 00:59:59,067
that was creepy.

1540
01:00:01,367 --> 01:00:03,000
- [Lisa] I wouldn't go
back there if you paid me.

1541
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:04,000
- I can't believe this.

1542
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,100
You guys are all pussies.

1543
01:00:05,133 --> 01:00:06,100
All of you.

1544
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:07,167
- Were you holding the camera?

1545
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,167
- Dude, I was there.

1546
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,167
And I saw the tape.

1547
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,367
It wasn't scary,
that was stupid.

1548
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,367
- Oh yeah?

1549
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,100
Care to make it interesting?

1550
01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:14,400
- What you got?

1551
01:00:15,267 --> 01:00:16,700
- 50.

1552
01:00:16,733 --> 01:00:19,367
You go in there tonight.

1553
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,867
- Guys, I really
don't want to go back.

1554
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,800
Stay home.

1555
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:26,367
- [Robert] You go in there,
you gotta take something.

1556
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,533
- No, I think Berty should go.

1557
01:00:27,567 --> 01:00:28,600
That sounds like his.

1558
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:29,800
- [Berty] No fucking way.

1559
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:30,667
- I'm not going back.

1560
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:31,500
(laughing)

1561
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:33,033
- Did you hear that?

1562
01:00:33,067 --> 01:00:35,833
Berty dropping an
f bomb up here.

1563
01:00:35,867 --> 01:00:38,233
You're right, your mom
said we're a bad influence

1564
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,067
on you.

1565
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,567
- Are you going?

1566
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,633
You go in and...

1567
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:46,067
- [Boggs] How am I just
supposed to go in there?

1568
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,500
Just be like, "Hey,
what's up, retards?"

1569
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:48,867
- You sneak in there.

1570
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,767
You go upstairs,
you grab a pillow.

1571
01:00:53,267 --> 01:00:54,467
Proof.

1572
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,567
- [Lisa] Not doing it, no way.

1573
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,400
- Stay home.

1574
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:57,233
You going?

1575
01:00:58,633 --> 01:00:59,600
- Tonight?

1576
01:00:59,633 --> 01:01:00,433
- Tonight.

1577
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:03,233
- Deal.

1578
01:01:03,267 --> 01:01:05,000
(thudding)
(laughing)

1579
01:01:05,033 --> 01:01:07,100
Don't throw me your shitty
girl cigarettes (laughing).

1580
01:01:07,133 --> 01:01:11,300
I still can't believe
yous aid fuck (laughing).

1581
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:13,167
How'd that taste in
your mouth, Berty?

1582
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,533
Your little dirty mouth.

1583
01:01:14,567 --> 01:01:17,367
(laughing)

1584
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,367
Let's get out of here.

1585
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,233
(engine rumbling)

1586
01:01:30,867 --> 01:01:32,967

1587
01:01:37,567 --> 01:01:41,067
Lisa Boggman,

1588
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,067
Oh, shit.

1589
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:42,933
Guess who.

1590
01:01:47,033 --> 01:01:48,600
(engine revving)

1591
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:50,867
(laughing)

1592
01:01:52,033 --> 01:01:52,833
Assholes!

1593
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,700
Turn off the lights.

1594
01:02:01,733 --> 01:02:02,700
- Oh, yeah.

1595
01:02:02,733 --> 01:02:04,400
Thank you (laughing).

1596
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,567
- [Lisa] Did they turn around?

1597
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,167
Why don't they just
leave us alone?

1598
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,833
- [Robert] Think they want
some of this. (laughing)

1599
01:02:09,867 --> 01:02:10,667
- [Boggs] Yeah, man.

1600
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,333
They're afraid of ya.

1601
01:02:12,367 --> 01:02:13,933
- [Robert] Here they come.

1602
01:02:15,433 --> 01:02:16,733
- [Lisa] What do they want?

1603
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:19,600
(engine rumbling)

1604
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:26,033
- I better see a pillow.

1605
01:02:26,067 --> 01:02:28,900
(train whistling)

1606
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:36,033
(thudding)

1607
01:02:36,067 --> 01:02:37,167
- I hope you little
mother fuckers

1608
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,633
are enjoying
yourselves in there.

1609
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:42,833

1610
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,267

1612
01:03:15,033 --> 01:03:15,867
Fuck.

1613
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:21,333
Oh, man. (metal knocking loudly)

1614
01:03:21,367 --> 01:03:22,200
(yelling)

1615
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:23,500
- [Boggs] Holy fuck.

1616
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:24,700
That's fucked up.

1617
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:27,500
- [Boggs] What
the fuck was that?

1618
01:03:29,267 --> 01:03:32,433
Robert, your flashlight
fucking sucks.

1619
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,400
Mother fucker.

1620
01:03:36,433 --> 01:03:37,267
Whoa.

1621
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:39,600
It's okay.

1622
01:03:39,633 --> 01:03:40,467
50 bucks.

1623
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,067
It's 50 bucks.

1624
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,700
(door opening)

1625
01:03:54,733 --> 01:03:57,233
Okay, okay...

1626

(opera music)

1627
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:03,267
Where is everybody?

1628
01:04:05,867 --> 01:04:08,733
They're playing
their music again.

1629
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:11,000
(grandfather clock chiming)

1630
01:04:11,033 --> 01:04:13,267
This is fucked up.

1632
01:04:17,033 --> 01:04:19,367
Shit. (breathing heavy)

01:04:22,167 --> 01:04:24,533
- [Boggs] Who fuckin'
decorates this place.

(static)

1635
01:04:30,067 --> 01:04:32,533
- [Boggs] All right, okay.

1636
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:33,467
We're okay.

1637
01:04:34,867 --> 01:04:35,833
- [Boggs] Go upstairs now.

1638
01:04:35,867 --> 01:04:37,400
(static)

1639
01:04:37,433 --> 01:04:40,367
- [Boggs] One step at a time.

1640
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,767
One step at a time.

1641

Okay...

1649
01:04:56,533 --> 01:04:58,967
No one in here.

1650
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:00,967
Where are they?

1651
01:05:05,233 --> 01:05:06,267

(thudding)

1655
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,567

Holy fuck, dude.

- [Robert] What was that all
about, dude? (engine starting)

1699
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:58,667
You dropped the pillow.

Go!

1703
01:07:01,967 --> 01:07:03,400
- [Robert] What?

1704
01:07:03,433 --> 01:07:04,900

1705
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:06,867
was that the scaredest
you've ever been?

1706
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,033

1707
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:10,733
- Think it was
those retards, man.

1708
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:12,600
Turn those lights off,

1709
01:07:12,633 --> 01:07:14,200
you can't see shit.

1710
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,733
I swear, it was like
they were speaking

1711
01:07:16,767 --> 01:07:18,933
a different language
or something.

1712
01:07:18,967 --> 01:07:20,367
- [Robert] You wanna go back?

1713
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,367
- [Boggs] Fuck you, dude.

1714
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,733
(laughing) I just wanted
us to see some creepy shit

1715
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:27,967
but now, I'm done

1716
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,467
Damn.

1717
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,333
Shit.

1718
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,967
- [Robert] Holy cow.

1719
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,433
- [Boggs] So,
where's my 50, Stain?

1720
01:07:36,467 --> 01:07:37,567
- [Robert] It was a five.

1721
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,567
- [Boggs] What?

1722
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,867
No, my ass that was a five.

1723
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,367
- [Jen] Oh, shit.

1724
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,367
- [Lisa] What?

1725
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,700
- [Jen] Shit, it's Wednesday.

1726
01:07:44,733 --> 01:07:45,933
Fuck.

1727
01:07:45,967 --> 01:07:47,033
- [Boggs] What?

1728
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:48,333
- [Jen] Pull over.

1729
01:07:48,367 --> 01:07:49,567
- [Robert] Why?

1730
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,500
- [Jen] Just pull over.

1731
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,667
- Man, where are we?

1732
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:58,700

1733
01:08:00,267 --> 01:08:01,200
- [Jen] Mom?

1734
01:08:02,033 --> 01:08:03,700
Mom, I'm at Derek's.

1735
01:08:04,567 --> 01:08:05,533
I know, I'm sorry.

1736

(static)

1737
01:08:07,533 --> 01:08:08,433
What?

1738
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:09,600
[Boggs] What's up her cooz?

1739
01:08:09,633 --> 01:08:11,800
We were watching a
movie and I fell asleep.

1740
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:13,333
I know, tell them I'm sorry.

1741
01:08:13,367 --> 01:08:14,867
All right, oh God.

1742
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:16,967
Okay, mom.

1743
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,433
Jesus, I'm sorry.

1744
01:08:18,467 --> 01:08:20,233
- [Boggs] Hi, Mrs. Naughton.

1745
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:22,267
(thunder cracking)

1746
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:25,400
- [Jen] All right,
I'll be home in a bit.

1747
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:26,767
Okay, I'll leave right now.

1748
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,000
Jesus.

1749
01:08:28,033 --> 01:08:29,600
Bye.

1750
01:08:29,633 --> 01:08:31,200
Mimi and Papa's
anniversary was tonight

1751
01:08:31,233 --> 01:08:33,233
and I totally forgot,

1752
01:08:33,267 --> 01:08:35,333
so now I'm fucked.

1753
01:08:35,367 --> 01:08:36,200
Oh shit.

1754
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,567
- [Boggs] Oh shit, there's
somebody out there. (thudding)

1755
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,400
- [Jen] Oh, my God.

1756
01:08:40,433 --> 01:08:41,433
Shit!

1757
01:08:41,467 --> 01:08:42,600
Lock it!

1758
01:08:42,633 --> 01:08:43,600
- [Lisa] Oh, my God.

1759
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:44,267
(yelling)
(thudding)

1760
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,600
Robert, go!

1761
01:08:45,633 --> 01:08:47,233
GO!!!

1762
01:08:47,267 --> 01:08:48,100
I can't hold this think!

1763

1764
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:53,433
Holy shit, man!

1765
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,300
- [Boggs] Fucking go, dude!

1766
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:58,133
- [Jen] Go!

(laughing)

1770
01:09:35,533 --> 01:09:36,367
- Shut up.

1771
01:09:38,233 --> 01:09:40,767
- [Boggs] So, what do you
guys want to do today?

1772
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,067
Go to Boston Mills, maybe,

1773
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,600
and just hang out?

1774
01:09:45,767 --> 01:09:47,467
- [Robert] Man, it's
kinda funny right now

1775
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,300
but Jesus Christ.

1776
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:50,900
- [Boggs] Come on.

1777
01:09:50,933 --> 01:09:52,700
It's still kinda funny.

1778
01:09:52,733 --> 01:09:53,867
- I have to work at four.

1779
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:54,933
- [Boggs] Call off.

1780
01:09:54,967 --> 01:09:56,000
We got a mission.

1781
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:57,467
- Oh, okay.

1782
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,067
- [Robert] Who
the fuck was that?

1783
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,433
- [Derek's Mother] Derek!

1784
01:10:00,467 --> 01:10:02,633
- [Boggs] Yeah, we're comin'.

1785
01:10:02,667 --> 01:10:04,200
- [Robert] Okay,
so where is it at?

1786
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,100
- I think we should
just call the cops.

1787
01:10:06,133 --> 01:10:08,800
- Mom's credit card's in there.

1788
01:10:08,833 --> 01:10:09,667
My ring.

1789
01:10:10,867 --> 01:10:12,267
Shit.

1790
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,200
- [Berty] We really
should just call the cops.

1791
01:10:13,233 --> 01:10:14,133
- [Robert] Hell no, dude.

1792
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:15,033
We're not calling the cops.

1793
01:10:15,067 --> 01:10:16,633
We can handle this.

1794
01:10:23,533 --> 01:10:25,767
- I think it's by the river.

1795
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:29,533
You know, by those rocks
we were sitting on?

1796
01:10:29,567 --> 01:10:30,867
- [Robert] Quadruple dog.

1797
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:31,967
(whistling)

1798
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,400
- [Boggs] Yeah, we're coming!

1799
01:10:33,433 --> 01:10:34,633
God.

1800
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:36,367
- [Robert] You think
it's by the river?

1801
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,300
- I don't know.

1802
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:42,333
Mom asked me for the
credit card yesterday.

1803
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:46,567
All I could see is my purse
sitting by those rocks.

1804
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,467
'Bout crapped my pants.

1805
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,833
I told her it was at your house.

1806
01:10:54,267 --> 01:10:55,367
- [Boggs] Don't sweat it, Lise.

1807
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,433
We'll get it.

1808
01:11:04,367 --> 01:11:06,867
- I don't wanna go back there.

1809
01:11:08,033 --> 01:11:11,567
I really don't wanna go
back there, you guys.

1810
01:11:13,267 --> 01:11:14,533
- [Boggs] It's okay, Lise.

1811
01:11:14,567 --> 01:11:17,067
I mean, we'll be all right.

1812
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,100
I'm serious.

1813
01:11:19,267 --> 01:11:21,267
Hey, you wanna know
why I picked the hawk?

1814
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,133
- No.

1815
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,533
- Because I can swoop down

1816
01:11:24,567 --> 01:11:25,867
and grab you stupid
little monkeys

1817
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,967
with my big giant talons.

1818
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,200
You know, just throw you
both over a dog ass cliff.

1819
01:11:32,233 --> 01:11:33,700
- [Derek's Mother] Derek!

1820
01:11:33,733 --> 01:11:35,700

Don't worry about
it, for God's sakes.
