I understand she is your partner

532
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:41,651
but given what
happened with the last

533
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,517
and the previous case
involving those two,

534
00:35:44,984 --> 00:35:48,451
I am concerned she may not
be particularly invested

535
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:49,984
in getting justice
for the victims.

536
00:35:50,618 --> 00:35:51,850
Captain, with all due respect,

537
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,883
I worked that case
alongside her the whole way.

538
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:55,777
She did everything
by the book and more.

539
00:35:56,184 --> 00:35:58,084
She made sure all
the witness testimony

540
00:35:58,284 --> 00:36:00,184
and the physical evidence
was properly presented

541
00:36:00,251 --> 00:36:01,251
to the court.

542
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:04,618
It's not her fault if the
judge had more sympathy

543
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:05,960
with the rapists
than the victims.

544
00:36:05,984 --> 00:36:07,284
She should have known better.

545

546
00:36:11,618 --> 00:36:13,217
I will be with her
the entire time.

547
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:16,750
I have as much confidence in
her as you have in me right now.

548
00:36:17,117 --> 00:36:18,637
She's the best
detective in the region.

549
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,184
If I see anything suggesting
she's not doing her work,

550
00:36:21,284 --> 00:36:23,451
I will let you know.
You have my word.

552

553
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:35,917
I will not hesitate throwing
you both under the bus

554
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:38,917

reputation of our precinct.

are tracking a suspect

558
00:36:48,817 --> 00:36:50,817
who is wanted for
other crimes abroad

559
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,684
whom they believe
to be in the area.

560
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:55,551
Needless to say,
international interests

561
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:57,984
will kill us after what
happened last time.

562

563
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:03,184
but perhaps a little
international attention

564
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:06,451

us back into good favors.

plan for tonight?

567

is organizing a party

568
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,750
and he is a friend of mine.

569

Isn't he on trial
for raping women?

570

Ah, he say they're
just gold diggers.

571
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,117
And you know what?
He's not my friend.

572
00:37:30,384 --> 00:37:31,618
I just work for him.

573
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:33,551
Doing what? Social
media stuff.

574
00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:36,050
You know the lake house
I'm talking about?

575
00:37:36,284 --> 00:37:37,417
Mm-hmm. It's his.

576
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:42,017
I would love to
meet him. You will.

577
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,384
He is known to get
pretty wild. I heard.

Our suspect, female Caucasian,
early thirties, Russian descent.

581
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,883
She keeps a
motorcycle-themed travel blog

582
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,817
across several social
media platforms.

583
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:10,351
She's targeting young men
between the ages of 16 and 30

584
00:38:11,117 --> 00:38:13,584
who are often in
online hate groups

585
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,451
glorifying violence
against women.

586
00:38:17,184 --> 00:38:19,150
She often kills in
the same fashion

587
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:21,284
as these videos posted online.

588
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:23,084

589
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:25,831

Taking all these

591
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,651
but the fact remains,
this is a serial killer.

592

It's making a lot more difficult

593

to track these

I believe she's been tracking
a particular Facebook friend

deceased, Sam Sandman,

596

the two Scandinavian tourists

597

sure you remember that.

599

convicted of possessing

600

pornographic material
and extortion.

601
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:01,117
It's likely that
that's her next victim.

Do we know any of
her other profiles?

She's currently in Morocco
under the name of Mya Snik.

604

Incidentally, Mya Snik, in
Russian means "Butcher."

Well, looking at where
some of the victims are

615
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:36,750
it looks more like a country
code or an area code.

616
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:38,984
Does this mean that
she's just telling us

617

there is more than one?

that Victim 1, Hakim Aouzad,

01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,817

by Victim 2, Moh El Khadr.

was the one responsible

1075
01:08:51,817 --> 01:08:53,684
for killing the two

Mr. Moh murdered Mr. Aouzad?

Yeah, absolutely.

Now, at this point, Mr. Moh...

1081

tried to kill the
missing suspect,

1082
01:09:12,117 --> 01:09:13,451
because she was a witness.

1083
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:15,251

point, you intervened?

Yeah. ROSS: Right?

1086
01:09:19,883 --> 01:09:24,184
Mr. Moh disarmed you, and
somehow in the struggle,

1087

already quite fatigued

with Mr. Aou... Aouzad.

1094
01:09:41,084 --> 01:09:43,217
I can see it in her eyes,
she's covering for her.

1095

you one more question.

her? (SCOFFS)

for me to admit this,

that you single-handedly

killed that man.
