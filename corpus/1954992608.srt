00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,823
<i>When I look back on my</i>
<i>Sophomore year in high school,</i>

2
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,883
<i>I was...well...
a uniquely tragic wreck.</i>

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,928
<i>In subsequent time,
there have been some,</i>

4
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,692
<i>friend and foe alike who have come</i>
<i>to question this claim.</i>

5
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,795
<i>But I come armed with proof.</i>

6
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,603
<i>At times like these I like to think</i>
<i>about the moments</i>

7
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,938
<i>before I go on a roller coaster
and feel the need</i>

8
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:42,533
<i>to emulate announcements one might</i>
<i>hear while waiting in line for such a ride.</i>

9
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,503
<i>Because what you are about to witness</i>

10
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,238
<i>is not for the weak-of-heart,</i>

11
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,148
<i>the easily offended</i>

12
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,242
<i>or those individuals who suffer</i>
<i>from a fragile constitution.</i>

13
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,148
<i>If you fall into any of these categories,</i>
<i>I would urge you:</i>

14
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,749
<i>leave now.</i>

15
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,680
<i>Pregnant women are cautioned as well.</i>

16
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,589
<i>Anyway, that's me:</i>
<i>right there, Chance Marquis.</i>

17
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,830
<i>A name my dear departed</i>
<i>mother thought</i>

18
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,695
<i>apropos for the gamble</i>
<i>she took on having me.</i>

19
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,924
<i>High school's a mess
for a lot of us, I realize.</i>

20
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,037
<i>But in comparison to my mess,</i>

21
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,539
<i>you might feel a twinge of guilt</i>

22
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,099
<i>for ever thinking yours was
at all challenging.</i>

23
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,404
<i>After all,</i>

24
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,577
<i>everything's about perspective,
is it not?</i>

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,639
<i>So, allow me to provide you
with some...</i>

26
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,877
<i>...Oh but this isn't
where my story begins.</i>

27
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,754
<i>It starts one year earlier</i>
<i>when I entered</i>

28
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,120
<i>Brickland International High School</i>
<i>as a transfer.</i>

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,793
<i>My fourth new school in the last four years</i>
<i>and my first time in Europe.</i>

30
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,701
<i>Keep in mind, this was the '80s.</i>

31
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,965
<i>Sometimes known as</i>
<i>the decade fashion forgot.</i>

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,837
<i>Like leg warmers,</i>

33
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,966
<i>always essential when getting ready</i>
<i>for first period Algebra.</i>

34
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,406
<i>There was also a preponderance of</i>
<i>thin ties and mullet haircuts.</i>

35
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:54,876
<i>In any case,</i>

36
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,275
<i>even then I recognized all</i>
<i>this conformity as tragic.</i>

37
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,554
<i>That one day we'd look back</i>
<i>on the parachute pants</i>

38
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,283
<i>and obsession over Smurfs</i>
<i>and ask ourselves...</i>

39
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:04,713
<i>Why?</i>

40
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,050
<i>But if the fashion was nightmare-ish</i>

41
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,625
<i>at least the music was good...</i>

42
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,197
<i>which provided a fairly accurate soundtrack</i>

43
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,461
<i>to the comic tragedy</i>
<i>that was my life back then.</i>

44
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:47,026
<i>I was assigned locker No. 13.</i>

45
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,459
<i>I was assigned locker No. 13.</i>

46
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,253
<i>It was a bad omen...and then this:</i>

47
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,990
<i>Within minutes, it was evident,</i>

48
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,129
<i>I was in hell...</i>

49
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:57,828
<i>literally.</i>

50
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,773
We've got spirit, yes we do!

51
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,707
We've got spirit and how 'bout you?!

52
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,841
I think it's in my locker...

53
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,404
trying to get out, apparently.

54
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,650
Faggot.

55
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,018
Oh really, no...

56
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,263
don't feel the need to announce your

57
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,128
your sexual-persuasion for my benefit.

58
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,091
Not me, man. You!

59
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,598
I can smell the stench all over you.
It stinks!

60
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,273
Which begs the question:

61
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,104
What were you just sniffing
to pick up the scent?

62
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,631
Their jock-straps?

63
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,470
Listen,

64
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,370
here's the rule, Mr. Peanut.

65
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,018
You do not speak to me unless
I give you permission.

66
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:45,916
You understand?

67
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,946
I understand.

68
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,249
I'm just not going to comply.

69
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,157
I did not give you permission to speak,
homo-breath!

70
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,920
He is making me crabby.

71
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,621
And here I thought 
that was your natural state... Aahhh!

72
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,359
Brad, what are you doing?

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,868
And who's he?

74
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,768
Dead meat in about 2 seconds.

75
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,063
Can you like,

76
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,263
pull yourself away from
your senseless terrorizing?

77
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,903
We need to talk.

78
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,177
Did you 'like' get permission?

79
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,513
You better shut-it man!

80
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,515
Oh my god, is he, like, raging again?

81
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,914
You shut it too, Rachel!

82
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,076
Brad, Brad...

83
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:21,615
Come on, let's go.

84
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,884
I'm telling you, Willy Wonka is history.

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,184
<i>Brad Harden...</i>

86
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,283
<i>and cronies.</i>

87
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,651
<i>I would ruminate more,</i>

88
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,830
<i>but we'll just let Brad read his own lines,</i>

89
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,067
<i>only in the more Neanderthal manner</i>
<i>befitting his 'character'.</i>

90
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,344
Are you Chance Marquis?

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,708
The one and only.

92
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:49,677
Great!

93
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,874
I'm Loretta Getzick,

94
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,286
Devil's Advocate Senior Sports Editor...

95
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,844
And you're on my team.

96
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,513
Um, you know I don't really do sports.

97
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,159
I know that most baseball uniforms

98
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,428
are inexplicably
made of a cotton-polyester blend,

99
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,918
but that's about the extent of it.

100
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,898
Ah, you'll learn then.

101
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,095
We have an open slot and Ms. Utterbach
assigned you.

102
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,372
Well, is Ms. 'Ootle-blagh' unaware of my knack
of

103
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,567
covering the daily antics of Rosemary Clooney?

104
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,875
Or my witty commentaries
on student fashion tragedies?

105
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,779
It was all in my resume...

106
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,043
I really have no idea
what you're talking about,

107
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,610
nor do I care.

108
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,182
Joey,

109
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,986
five hundred words on newest

110
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,181
swim team member, Sara Bagshawe.

111
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,251
'Is that a Dolphin in our pool?'

112
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,995
Kimmie, in-depth interview with
Reichen Froman,

113
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:36,963
the team mascot.

114
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,557
Some art students made
a new devil head for the costume.

115
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,761
'Too Scary or Too Merry?'

116
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:48,770
And, a big Brickland Devil's Times
welcome to...Chance!

117
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,166
Full-feature on the varsity football team.

118
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:52,979
I know!

119
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,708
We're going to see what he's made of.

120
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,274
In-depth interviews with players,
coaches and fans.

121
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,978
'Is this the year we win it all?'

122
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,592
All what?

123
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,874
Hank Hudson, Staff Photographer.

124
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,846
Loretta Go-Get-Em assigned me to

125
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,643
snap some shots
for your football piece.

126
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,014
Where do you want to start?

127
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,179
Over.

128
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,888
Let me ask you this,
staff-photographer-Hank-Hudson:

129
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,083
do you have knowledge
of this football?

130
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,049
Football?

131
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:39,692
Footooboo...

132
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,819
Well, I know that
when they play it in America,

133
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,622
they call it soccer,

134
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,097
but it looks the same

135
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,362
and if you touch the ball with your hands,

136
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:48,925
they kick you out.

137
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:49,864
Forever.

138
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,195
Or do they make you a goalie...?

139
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,942
What's in your case?

140
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:00,978
What's in yours?

141
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,641
I don't have one.

142
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,573
One what?

143
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,080
<i>Freak.</i>

144
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,717
<i>But curiously enough,</i>
<i>I was warming up to him.</i>

145
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,848
Huh! Urgh!

146
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,663
Take a picture, it'll last longer.

147
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,804
<i>If that was her way of making</i>
<i>a witty first- impression,</i>

148
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,611
<i>then my guess was that the</i>
<i>pulled-too-tight pony tail</i>

149
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,079
<i>was cutting-off blood flow
to her brain.</i>

150
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:39,982
I don't 'do' tennis.

151
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,611
Forty-love and deuce and shit...

152
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,782
no wonder the British lost,

153
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,792
can't even figure out
how to score stuff.

154
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,728
The origin of scoring
is French actually,

155
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,161
bastardized into English.

156
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,364
Deuce for instance,

157
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,999
being a corruption of 'deux',

158
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,058
meaning two consecutive exchanges
needed to win.

159
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,294
Now 'love' is either a vulgarisation
of the word 'l'oeuf'...

160
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,905
Please, your dorkiness

161
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,541
was already established with
the top-hat and cane.

162
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:06,369
Look,

163
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,948
Heretic can't see over
to this backstop.

164
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,082
Which means

165
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,918
I don't have to hit a stupid ball

166
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,386
against a wall for 45 minutes.

167
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,086
So fascinating!

168
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,148
Heretic?

169
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,183
Coach Hera.

170
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,852
The troglodyte
from sex-reassignment hell.

171
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:22,923
Really?

172
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,296
She was a he?

173
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,224
In actuality,

174
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,560
who the hell knows?

175
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,169
in my made-up reality,

176
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:30,828
yes!

177
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,805
I'm Chance.

178
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,103
Your reality just might fascinate me.

179
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,136
Twyla.

180
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,002
And your pasty-white legs

181
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,201
definitely repulse me.

182
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,144
If the shorts weren't so dark,
the contrast would be lessened.

183
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,410
Ergo, my legs would not appear
so falsely pale.

184
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,612
You don't have many friends,
do you Chance?

185
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,023
I just moved here.

186
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,115
So far, I hate it.

187
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,997
Not likely to change.

188
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,926
Chance Marquis,
please report to Administration.

189
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,366
Now.

190
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,799
Admin's that way...

191
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,713
Chance Marquis...

192
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,075
<i>Vice Principal Ophelia Smelker.</i>

193
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,707
<i>As disturbing in-person as she</i>
<i>appears in her photos,</i>

194
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,320
<i>and quite possibly the most odorous human</i>
<i>I've ever encountered...</i>

195
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,054
<i>and not in a pleasing way.</i>

196
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,655
Remove the hat, please.

197
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,558
Looking over your file here...

198
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,922
Transfer records, report cards,

199
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,466
personal items.

200
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:39,227
Why aren't you enrolled
in our mixed choir?

201
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,764
Uh, polyps.

202
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,066
I beg your pardon.

203
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,968
Polyps. On my vocal cords.

204
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,736
I can't sing until they heal.

205
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,910
What about surgery?

206
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,375
It's against our religion.

207
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,348
Which is...?

208
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,850
Not to be discussed.

209
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,964
Your permanent records show,
among other things,

210
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,266
instances of misbehavior,

211
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:10,302
insubordination and episodes of...

212
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,430
channelling deceased torch singers,

213
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:19,006
such as: Rosemary Clooney, Dionne Warwick
and Ethel Merman.

214
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,846
Care to explain that one?

215
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,211
I'd rather not, it's personal.

216
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,282
And quite frankly,

217
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,909
I don't remember because
I'm not 'au courant' when it happens.

218
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,252
There's one thing you will have to explain:

219
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,395
your locker.

220
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,625
Destruction of school property
is a severe offense.

221
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,366
As it should be.

222
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,698
But my question to you would be this:

223
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,039
what branch of logic do you cleave to

224
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,473
that would explain why I
would destroy my own locker?

225
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,877
The first day of school
is often filled with rage...

226
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,781
especially for transfer students.

227
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,557
V-P Smelker runs a tight ship here
at Brickland High.

228
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,823
Her tolerance is low for wiseacres.

229
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,696
And even lower for weirdoes.

230
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,229
CAPEESH?!

231
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:23,399
<i>I was unaware that overweight women from the</i>
<i>Eastern block used words like 'capeesh'.</i>

232
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,418
Then Mrs. Zito split us into groups.

233
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,956
I'm in the 'Alligators' for math and science.

234
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,886
And where do the Alligators rank?

235
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,197
Starts with an 'A', Sir. Duh! Tippy-top.

236
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,024
Outstanding. Excellent!

237
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,900
What's that doing on the table?

238
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,133
Chance wore it to school today.

239
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,367
What next, a dress?

240
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,835
<i>My dad.</i>

241
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,774
<i>A man who never met a rule</i>
<i>he didn't try out at least once...</i>

242
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,473
<i>or a firearm.</i>

243
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,417
What kind of reaction do you get when
you show up with something like that on?

244
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,186
It varies.

245
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,382
The people behind me get upset because
they can't see the blackboard...

246
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:13,654
Due to the hat.

247
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,318
Mostly, they just miss the point.

248
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,823
Which is what, exactly?

249
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,300
That my chosen expression of
individualism should be embraced,

250
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,267
not ridiculed.

251
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,997
Someone hit him in the head
with a tennis ball.

252
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,340
Then he got sent
to the Vice Principal

253
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,399
after a bully called him
a homosexual.

254
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,672
<i>Sienna,</i>

255
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,039
<i>my real sister with the fake accent.</i>

256
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,338
<i>I tell her everything and, quite often,</i>
<i>live to regret it.</i>

257
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,715
Why did they send you
to the principal's office for that?

258
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,450
Long story.

259
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,814
She already has it out for me though.

260
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,426
She's also one of the largest women
I've ever seen...

261
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,825
like circus-large.

262
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,763
I'm sure if she were to grow a beard,

263
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,698
which I'm quite certain she's capable of-

264
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:53,596
Chance,

265
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,398
understood.

266
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,502
Sounds like
you had a rough day, Cadet.

267
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,975
But I think you forgot
rule number one,

268
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,743
which is: when kids call you names,

269
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,811
you stand up for yourself

270
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,869
like a man.

271
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,946
I think he needs more R-T-T.

272
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,085
Retrograde Tactical Training?

273
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,017
Roger that.

274
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,716
What did you enjoy most about that?

275
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,154
Jujitsu.

276
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:19,824
Aye!

277
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,024
When I was nine.

278
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,261
'Kids' aren't calling me names.

279
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:26,858
One of them, Brad Harden,

280
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:27,966
called me 'homo-breath,'

281
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,495
but he started off with 'faggot'.

282
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:30,867
Chance,

283
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,997
you know I don't like to hear
that word in this house.

284
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,970
As opposed to just living with one?

285
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,086
Getting settled in?

286
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,425
Listen Chance,

287
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,867
a unit is only as strong
as its weakest link.

288
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,931
It's my job to shore up the links.

289
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,537
Do you understand?

290
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:17,376
Chance,

291
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,282
understood?

292
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,419
Lights out soon.

293
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,357
I said come back here right now.

294
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,493
Don't walk away from me,
we're not done discussing this!

295
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,203
Well, I'm done discussing it!

296
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,764
Did you ever think that playing football
is not the answer to everything?

297
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,937
Then explain to me how you're
gonna pay for your tuition!

298
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,103
How are you gonna pay
for your studies?!

299
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,716
You think its me
who's gonna pay for that!

300
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,451
I don't care,
I'll figure something out!

301
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,420
Don't blow this
football scholarship, Lee.

302
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,786
Start figuring that out and soon!!

303
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:03,481
<i>Sometimes life has a strange way of giving</i>
<i>you EXACTLY what you want.</i>

304
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,266
<i>And then making you pay,</i>

305
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,597
<i>dearly.</i>

306
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,188
So, does your dad keep like,
guns and artillery at home?

307
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,920
Uh, affirmative.

308
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,796
The hand-grenades are stored
in the dining buffet

309
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,388
and he only loads the semi-automatics,

310
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,456
but we feel very safe.

311
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,969
Are you trying to piss me off on purpose?

312
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,300
Because sittin' here

313
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,240
with you two losers is doing
nothing for my reputation.

314
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,640
And, for the record...you are poison.

315
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,907
And you're... plain toxic.

316
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,573
Well, your reputation, from what
I observe, is pretty much non-existent.

317
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,186
So at least being seen with us,
you have fumes of relevance.

318
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,448
It's a step up in my book.

319
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,087
Do you smell that?

320
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:16,854
Students...

321
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,792
On the bench Miss Tiller.

322
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,999
Tables are not chairs.

323
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,632
Mr. Hudson,

324
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,307
open your briefcase please.

325
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,206
Why?

326
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,281
A general inspection.

327
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,078
This is private property.

328
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,309
That's illegal search and seizure.

329
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:42,847
Not on this campus.

330
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,982
This school is beholden
to a different law:

331
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,892
'V-P Smelker's Law.'

332
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,287
OPEN IT!

333
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,101
What happened to your eye?

334
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,143
Nothing,

335
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,303
why do you inquire?

336
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,379
Could you move those?

337
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,822
Ahh, I missed
the first two days of class...

338
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,127
Ms. Hughes said you
were the only solo left.

339
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,998
Guess that makes us lab partners.

340
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,872
Well, I pride myself on being the last
chosen, not only in sports,

341
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,931
but in combustible experiments as well.

342
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,075
I'm Levi.

343
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,513
Uh, Chance Marquis.

344
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,011
Chance. C-H-A-N-C-E. Chance.

345
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,784
I think we're neighbors...

346
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,332
I don't suppose you'd believe
I have an identical twin brother

347
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,856
who looks exactly like me...

348
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,664
I can show you how to rig your
cable box for the porn channels.

349
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,312
Hey, forget about it -
I already have. Okay?

350
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,147
I wish my ex-girlfriend looked at me
like that a couple of times, though.

351
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,415
What happened to your eye?

352
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,492
Nothing.

353
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,254
Why?

354
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,633
Hey, Cinderfella,

355
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,007
the women's locker room
is on the other side.

356
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,742
Oh! Um...
Listen up sporty-type-fellas.

357
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,685
Look, I'm doing a piece on the team

358
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,120
for the paper and was really, really

359
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,348
hoping for some interviews?

360
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,986
You breakin' my no-talk rule again?

361
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,819
Why do you have to defy me? Huh?!

362
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,462
Call me a masochist.

363
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,827
I'll call you a douche-bag,

364
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,090
'cuz that's what you are.

365
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,227
Listen up!

366
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,067
As the team captain,
I'm giving a direct order here...

367
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,074
Nobody talks to the douche-bag
about our team.

368
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:16,665
You got it?

369
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,167
Not one word, okay?

370
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,169
How come?

371
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,270
Well, you see Gus man...
that's why I'm here.

372
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,748
To think when your brain pauses.

373
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,014
You don't want homosexuals
in your head.

374
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,780
Give 'em a crack and

375
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,624
you're listenin' to 'Sister Christian'

376
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,218
and jerking off
to pictures of Patrick Swayze!

377
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,822
Night Ranger's gay?

378
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,288
Well, who knows man,
but that fuckin' song is!

379
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,667
Patrick Swayze pictures?

380
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,430
Or Rick Springfield,
you know whoever!

381
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,634
Look, the point is...

382
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,069
he'll just write some girlie article

383
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,231
that'll make us look like girls!

384
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:56,972
I'm sorry fruit-fly,

385
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,450
but that's the way the fudge is packed.

386
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,291
Why do you let him call you those names?

387
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:20,666
Well, where I show anger and agitation over
his derogatory comments regarding what I am,

388
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,438
I bequeath him power, no?

389
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:28,206
And I've deduced that since Brad's intelligence
hovers only slightly above that of burnt toast,

390
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,943
why give him that kind of control over me?

391
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,057
The 'Split Infinitives' ladies and gentlemen.

392
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,216
Not bad, huh?

393
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,692
A back-beat would help.

394
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,556
Drummer's taking a leak.

395
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:20,759
What do you think?

396
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,702
Ah, I... I think,

397
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,431
Foreigner songs
are better left to... Foreigner?

398
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,035
That wasn't Foreigner.

399
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,067
Do you ever cover the Carpenters?

400
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,035
Karen has a lovely voice.

401
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:39,711
Hey! What's the faggot doing here?

402
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,021
Your band is dreadful.

403
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,781
But they're actually
a lot better without you!

404
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:51,960
A real cute kid.

405
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,304
Take a chill-pill,

406
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:10,041
you'll totally smell her before
she gets within 50 yards.

407
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,681
A hundred if we're downwind.

408
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,181
She's in my nightmares.

409
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,382
She IS my nightmares...

410
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,683
Hey, you guys wanna go into
the city this weekend?

411
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,520
I have this day-long photo project,

412
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,663
what I have to do, see,

413
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:27,232
is take a picture
every hour of the same thing and-

414
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,201
Okay. We'll go.

415
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,566
And for future reference,

416
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,499
we don't care that much about
your photo projects.

417
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:34,966
So fascinating!

418
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:56,818
Can I just ask:

419
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,963
what's proper protocol should this
vehicle spontaneously combust?

420
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,634
Look Prince Weird-Clothes,

421
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:06,092
if his highness would rather walk,
I can pull over right now.

422
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:07,530
Zip it...

423
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,810
Finally.

424
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,713
Can we do something interesting now?

425
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:54,807
I thought we were.

426
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,982
Do we look interested?

427
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,391
It's sort of hard to tell,

428
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,360
cuz the two of you never look
interested in anything.

429
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,158
I have an idea...

430
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,430
I'm just not sure if two of you
are man enough...

431
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,267
Are you?

432
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,206
Agreed. Stupid question.

433
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,901
Of course you are, Sir.

434
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,602
C'mon girls.

435
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,642
This looks like a nice
upscale neighborhood.

436
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,849
Look out for the curve...

437
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,407
Relax... I'm parking.

438
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,894
Those things will kill you.

439
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,425
They're much like dark alleys that way.

440
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,969
Club Red and Blue.

441
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,641
Twenty-one and over.

442
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,268
So we're going in the side entrance.

443
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:52,638
With what?

444
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,972
A battering ram and fake police badges?

445
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,114
C'mon, just follow me.

446
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,642
What kind of club is this?

447
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,976
You'll see.

448
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,491
Hey Sasha.

449
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,659
Hi Twyla, how are you?

450
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,931
I'm sixteen,

451
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,331
in high school
and I got two losers in-tow.

452
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,404
Life just continues
to suck big ostrich eggs.

453
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,428
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

454
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,599
You lost, sweetie?

455
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,534
Help me with the dress, will you.

456
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,821
So schoolboy,

457
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,254
how do they call you?

458
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,618
Chance Marquis.

459
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,453
Claire Vuoyant.

460
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,786
What a fabulous name.

461
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,461
Give my regards
to the angel who named you.

462
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,102
That would be my dear-departed mother.

463
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,268
May she rest in peace.

464
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,037
Claire Vuoyant,

465
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,134
I like it.

466
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,973
I can see queerly now!

467
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,908
So, how old are you?

468
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:17,908
Uh...twenty-two.

469
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,845
Yeah, right. Six years from now, baby.

470
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,416
Hum ! You don't bullshit a drag,

471
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,155
especially when she's known for her
precognitive powers.

472
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,292
It only leads to a heartache
and a sore rear.

473
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,625
I think we're scaring
Oliver Twist over here, ladies!

474
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,190
I'm not scared.

475
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:42,407
Good, because with a little glitter
and a fabulous dress

476
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:43,931
get your britches in a twist,

477
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:46,669
you'll positively faint
when Lily Pad over there,

478
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,210
takes her thong off.

479
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:51,776
You were great out there tonight.

480
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,543
Thank you, Rex Reed.

481
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,181
Oh, don't mention the hair?

482
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,052
The dress?
The dress was a star tonight!

483
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,124
The whole package was astounding.

484
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,488
Well, if done correctly,
the package was invisible.

485
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,864
Where's Chance?

486
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,294
He was right behind me.

487
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,801
Go find him!

488
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,630
What're you going to do?

489
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,902
Wait. Have a cigarette.

490
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,606
Ponder why dweebs are drawn to me.

491
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,881
Well, you don't learn it, per se.

492
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,984
It's more like...
it just pops out one day.

493
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,718
Then you refine.

494
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,352
Find the right dress, the right song,

495
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,785
right name, and then you practice
till your feet bleed.

496
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,118
Bitch,

497
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,430
your feet wouldn't bleed if you'd admit

498
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,992
to their actual big-ass largeness
and stop wearing size-sixes.

499
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,769
Lily, until you stop menstruating,
talk to the hand!

500
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,043
You're all so sassy and sarcastic,

501
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,273
but no one retaliates
in a truly harmful way.

502
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,238
I saw that bitch!

503
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,608
Don't make me replace your
crack with baking soda!

504
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:05,787
Chance?

505
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,288
Here,

506
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,592
you should try it some time.

507
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,126
I think you'd be a natural.

508
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:19,369
Just remember, Chance,

509
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,300
this is an illusion.

510
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,600
You have to make everyone believe.

511
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,342
Starting with yourself.

512
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,739
No-no, if you wait to jump
a half-second longer,

513
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,071
the frog can make it across
in a straight shot, but--

514
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,403
Hey, Tinkerbell!

515
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,212
So how's the story going, man?

516
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,241
You want a quote?

517
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,078
Yup.

518
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,678
Someday soon,

519
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,077
when you least expect it,

520
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,522
I am gonna totally kick
your fairy-ass.

521
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,459
Brad, can we go?

522
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,263
Just screwin' with him baby,

523
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,423
just screwin' with him.

524
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,562
Hmmm.... peanuts,
don't mind if I do.

525
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,004
You familiar with the concept of REVENGE?

526
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:37,113
Yeah, ever since Judy Hatteberg
appropriated my chalk in kindergarten.

527
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,308
She paid.

528
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,354
You're a shark, and Brad's the remora,

529
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,687
suctioned to you tighter than spandex
on David Lee Roth.

530
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,293
So, there's only one thing to do:

531
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,996
grab it by its tail,

532
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,396
rip it from your flesh
and then SMASH IT!

533
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,636
High school is like Darwinism in a test tube:
survival of the fittest.

534
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:06,568
Only here, because Brad outweighs
you by fifty pounds,

535
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,509
fit equals smart.

536
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,147
Hey Chance,

537
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,420
you still need someone to interview
for your story?

538
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:19,584
Why?

539
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,292
Did you take pity on me and convince your

540
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:24,159
best friend and favorite drummer,
Brad Harden, to sit for an interview?

541
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,626
Brad hates you.

542
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,958
Besides, the only thing
that convinces Brad of anything

543
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,229
is Brad.

544
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,733
Or Toni.

545
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,803
But even then, it's only when
she's denying him sex.

546
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,942
Anyway, I was thinkin' you
could interview me.

547
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,710
Well, I hate to point out the fact that
you might be as dense as a redwood, Levi,

548
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,119
but I need to interview someone who
actually plays on the team.

549
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,848
Ergo, not you.

550
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,444
I appreciate the insult.

551
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:52,720
What insult?

552
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,159
I'm a first-string forward.

553
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,161
I haven't been practicing
because of a knee injury,

554
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,288
but it should be okay by
the season opener.

555
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,131
Wait, wait... What?

556
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,996
You're getting around
to telling me this, now?

557
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,001
I thought you'd appreciate the,
you know...

558
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,835
dramatic pause.

559
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,034
Why?

560
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,340
Aren't your people all into
drama and stuff?

561
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,841
You're so correct, right up there with
gingham and party-planning.

562
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:20,380
My 'people' are also into
the fashionably ironic,

563
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,876
but I'll make an exception in your case.

564
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,060
Hey! I can be ironic!

565
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,923
Dang, is this inside out?

566
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:41,968
What's your favorite kind of music?

567
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,739
I like lots of music.

568
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,944
Correction. I love music.

569
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,942
When is your band playing next?

570
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,221
'Seventh Annual
Battle-of-the-High-School-Bands'

571
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,828
The winner gets one-free-week studio time,

572
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,594
and a guaranteed listen of their music by
some big London music producer.

573
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,229
Pretty sweet, huh?

574
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,661
I think we have a real shot.

575
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,464
Who, 'we'?

576
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,498
The Split-Infinitives!

577
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,299
We're gonna rock the shit.

578
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,868
Can I be honest with you, Chance?

579
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,745
Music is my life.

580
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,115
It's everything.

581
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,548
I can feel it, in my soul.

582
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:29,611
You know?

583
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,449
Well, can I be honest with you?

584
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,091
From what I heard, your band is...

585
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,088
how do I best put this:

586
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:38,918
God-awful.

587
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,357
Fetid. Pedicular.

588
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,027
And by pedicular, I mean lousy.

589
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,066
I don't expect you to get it.

590
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,105
People who feel the music,

591
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,504
who can't live without it,

592
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,674
they get it.

593
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,871
Besides, we'll get better.

594
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,045
Levi?

595
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,410
Oh, didn't know you had company.

596
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:56,614
This is Chance.

597
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:57,603
He lives next door.

598
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,505
How's the knee, you run today?

599
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,585
Chance is writing an article on the team
for the school paper.

600
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,020
That right?

601
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,758
Lee's the best!

602
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,921
He's gonna have U.S. university recruiters
salivating over him this year,

603
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,529
right, Lee?

604
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,589
Right, Dad.

605
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,240
The rain in Spain
flows mainly in the plain...

606
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,539
Braid my hair?

607
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,952
'Split Infinitives'

608
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,355
- that's a stupid name for a band, I think.

609
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,255
You're a way better singer than he is.

610
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,226
How is it you state things with such

611
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,194
atypical certainty and authority?

612
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,762
And in such a flawless, bogus accent?

613
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,266
It's like you know exactly what everyone
should be doing...

614
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,495
Or what they should be.

615
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,061
Not what, who.

616
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,440
For instance, I am a beauty queen.

617
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,377
Do I push that away? No,

618
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:00,469
I embrace it.

619
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,371
And mastering this accent is the
final piece in the puzzle...

620
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,912
that is, Miss U.K. Junior
twelve-and-under.

621
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,613
Everyone should embrace who they are.

622
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:11,246
Including you.

623
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,192
Well, you'll learn as you get older,

624
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,887
you actually know less about who you are.

625
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,798
That's just silly talk.

626
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,932
I know who you are.

627
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,058
And what you should be.

628
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,027
There you go.

629
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,637
Thanks!

630
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,312
Bee-rilliant!

631
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,215
You really came through, Chance.
Good job!

632
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:15,015
Hank, your photos are totally wicked!

633
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,050
I think the team's going to read it
and be inspired.

634
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,718
It's going to be a good season!

635
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,229
They're going to blow.

636
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,031
Most assuredly.

637
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,069
Brilliant!

638
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,607
Good to have your bender back.

639
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,776
Yeah.

640
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,138
So uh... I gotta ask,

641
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,473
what were you thinking?

642
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,347
You know, talkin' to
the jack-off for his story?

643
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,021
It's just a stupid article, who cares?

644
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,750
Well, everyone man.

645
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,686
And now it's in print.

646
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,722
Forever.

647
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,229
Look, I don't know if you noticed lately,

648
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,560
but we are the shit around here.

649
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:03,426
Gods, man. And I've worked way too hard
to let you throw that away

650
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,100
by hanging with some
lunatic-fringe fairy-queen.

651
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,467
He's turning you into a joke, Levi.

652
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,201
And you don't even see it.

653
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,736
You give him too much credit.

654
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,433
No, the credit's all yours!

655
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,941
Stay away from him, man.

656
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:19,943
Is that a threat?

657
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,293
What are you looking for?

658
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,698
A little peace and quiet.

659
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,506
This was her favorite.

660
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,543
It's beautifully crafted.

661
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,312
Look at the beading detail.

662
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,243
A timeless fashion.

663
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,708
Exquisite...

664
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,187
Why are you looking through
Mom's old dresses?

665
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,491
Don't you have
a tiara to polish?

666
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:09,724
Hey, Levi.

667
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,965
I just wanted to say thanks again,
for aiding me with my article.

668
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,266
I thought you might like some of Hank's
photos of you at soccer practice...

669
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,634
Uh, hello?

670
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,699
Thanks, but I'll pass.

671
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,527
Chance do you have a--

672
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,198
Close the door!

673
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,382
It's not bad...

674
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,514
Have you ever heard of lip-liner?

675
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,084
Hello?!

676
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,660
If Cyndi Lauper can manage it,
so can you.

677
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,242
Your foundation is a tad uneven.

678
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,681
Is this your outfit for school tomorrow?

679
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,286
You're going to enter?

680
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,248
Teenagers get to do all the fun stuff.

681
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:18,384
I don't know how much fun it'll be
after ten minutes in heels.

682
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:20,959
I can show you wear to put band-aids.

683
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,960
They'll keep your feet from blistering.

684
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,527
Hey, don't tell anyone about this.

685
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,336
Especially not Sir.

686
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,730
If anyone I know sees me like this,

687
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,101
I am done for.

688
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,807
No matter how well I pull it off.

689
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,520
Jesus and Mary
and our Commander-in-Chief,

690
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,321
Ronald Reagan!

691
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:45,652
What the hell are we doing here?!

692
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,152
Is that your mother's dress?

693
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,891
It shouldn't go to waste.

694
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:54,425
I did his make-up.

695
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,366
Well, you did a very nice job, Honey...

696
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:00,865
Okay.

697
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,873
He wanted to spare your feelings,

698
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,905
but truthfully, I could tell...

699
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,476
he thinks your eye shadow is too dark.

700
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,608
Doesn't anyone ever knock in this house?

701
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:33,623
The Debbie-Gibson-Red
is definitely your color.

702
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,235
Stay calm.

703
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:44,975
Sasha means well, he thinks he can find for
every queen her name and 'inner song'.

704
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,806
It only should take a second.

705
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:48,870
Pepper Madison.

706
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,078
Dancing Queen!

707
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:51,813
Are you sure?

708
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,918
Listen to me Pepper,
if you sing 'Dancing Queen'

709
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,148
you will be the star performer of the night.

710
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,019
I might even make you a regular.

711
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,128
I didn't practice Dancing Queen.

712
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,586
Don't worry, Sasha means well,
but he's a little bit funny in the head.

713
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:10,558
He always want us to sing 'Dancing Queen.'

714
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:13,560
Are you nervous?

715
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:15,233
A little bit...

716
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:16,140
Yeah...

717
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,573
Okay, a lotta bit.

718
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,443
Don't worry. Butterflies are good.

719
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,569
But think about this:

720
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,706
failure is not an option.

721
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,250
And whatever you do tonight
don't turn on the mic.

722
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,114
Ok?

723
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,148
But you'll be a star tonight.

724
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,703
Claire Vuoyant everyone...

725
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,000
always hard to top.

726
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:25,709
In fact, I have it on good authority
she has her ass tattooed:

727
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,233
'No Entry.'

728
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,440
'For eight-inches and under.'

729
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,441
Okay, let's keep this train-wreck
of a night going.

730
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:36,753
Next up is a first-timer, so ladies,

731
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:39,381
keep those beer bottles in your
mouths where they belong.

732
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:43,381
Here she is: Lucky Chance!

733
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,340
I was bom to run

734
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,903
I was born to dream

735
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,880
Craziest boy you've ever seen

736
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,848
I've gotta do it my way

737
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,218
Or no way at all

738
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,717
And I was here to please

739
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,158
I'm even on my knees

740
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:54,125
Making love to whoever I please

741
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,193
I've gotta do it my way

742
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,133
Or no way at all

743
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:03,067
And then you came around

744
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,204
Tryin' to tie me down

745
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,406
I was such a clown

746
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,378
You had to have it your way

747
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,376
Or no way at all

748
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:17,977
Why don't you turn me loose

749
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:21,918
Turn me loose, turn me loose

750
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,758
I've gotta have it my way

751
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,929
Or no way at all

752
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,062
Why don't you turn me loose

753
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:38,199
Turn me loose, turn me loose

754
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,903
I've gotta have it my way

755
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,780
Or no way at all

756
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:50,287
And I'm here to please

757
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:52,422
Even on my knees

758
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,323
Making love to whoever I please

759
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,521
I've gotta do it my way

760
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:50,902
What's going on?

761
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,074
The Split Infinitives have officially...

762
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:56,914
split.

763
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,317
Grammar police cracking down?

764
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,084
Look Chance, I don't mean
to be a jerk or nothing, but--

765
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,419
But you just decided to be one anyway.

766
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,768
Listen, I can't really hang with you anymore.

767
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,505
My dad's being a hard-ass about football,

768
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,666
and concentrating on getting a scholarship.

769
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,867
That's why he made you quit the band?

770
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:25,514
What happened to your whole
'music is my life' mantra?

771
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,242
Well,

772
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,315
it's like you said, we're...
What was it?

773
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:31,583
Pedicular?

774
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,383
So, no big loss.

775
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:38,294
I don't know a meteor could hit the earth,
causing you to get better.

776
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,619
I think I saw it once in an Ed Wood film.

777
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,266
I know the real reason you
don't want to be seen with me.

778
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:48,493
It's not what you think.

779
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,366
I don't care that you dig guys.

780
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:54,106
I believe that.

781
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,212
But you do care
if other people think you do...

782
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,081
by way of association.

783
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:04,246
I never realized Brad had
so much sway over you.

784
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:07,324
Usually the drummer is the most expendable.

785
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,025
Look, I don't expect you to get it.

786
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,287
There's a news flash.

787
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,189
You don't expect me to get much, do you?

788
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:15,263
Continually underestimating me
for some unknown reason.

789
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,436
You're not as complicated
as you think you are.

790
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:20,425
How the hell would you know?

791
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:22,299
I'm a teenager, too.

792
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,169
And infinitely
more complicated than you.

793
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,440
Is that so?

794
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,071
I don't see any dresses in your closet.

795
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,420
It's okay.

796
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,483
Guys like you are never friends
with the likes of me.

797
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,558
So in that regard,
you turned out true to form.

798
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,394
Ouch.

799
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,360
Someday, you're gonna have
to stand up to people.

800
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,827
People like Brad...

801
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,104
like your father.

802
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,774
Eventually maybe even yourself.

803
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,500
So, how's your
revenge-on-Brad plan coming?

804
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,429
Yeah, what you got?

805
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:28,402
A headache.

806
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:30,840
Besides, I think
he's forgotten about me.

807
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,535
I'm off his radar.

808
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,210
Jerk!

809
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,171
Hey!

810
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:38,478
Look, Whoopi,

811
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:42,051
it ain't my fault his big fat face
got in the way, okay?

812
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,246
Hey! Marquis...

813
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:45,681
next time, duck.

814
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,247
Like the chicken you are.

815
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,088
That makes no sense.

816
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,294
On a pure poultry level.

817
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,629
Hey! Jimmy Olsen,

818
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:53,863
no one's talking to you.

819
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,298
Why are you so angry all the time?

820
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:56,629
What did I even do to you?

821
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:58,700
Invaded my school.

822
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:02,362
I mean, your presence alone is enough
to make me wanna puke.

823
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:03,836
Don't you get it man?

824
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:05,834
You don't belong here.

825
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,239
So, leave.

826
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,372
Fairy Academy is back in the states.

827
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,449
They're waiting for you.

828
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,078
Let's go, man.

829
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:24,020
Forget about it man,
well beat him up tomorrow.

830
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:33,367
So, what was that all about being
'off his radar'?

831
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,895
A man can't go on like this.

832
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,400
Or you, even.

833
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:39,668
Do something!

834
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,979
I know why he's so angry all the time.

835
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:48,218
This plan is unwise.

836
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:49,549
Not to mention, uncouth.

837
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,717
It's high-risk, I agree.

838
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:55,123
Grow some balls! The both of you.

839
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:58,395
And stop talking like
a forty-year-old British fop.

840
00:54:58,395 --> 00:54:59,453
It's bizarro.

841
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:02,896
If I do like this--

842
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:04,892
Abort.

843
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,161
and if I do this-

844
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:10,573
Then the abort is off and we're back on.

845
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:12,803
But then, if I do...

846
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,744
Mr. Samsonite, shut it!

847
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,934
Okay, Air Craft Carrier Smelker
has passed.

848
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:44,032
C'mon!

849
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,586
I need to see the nurse!

850
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,760
I'm dying.

851
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,227
Not before I get a petition form.

852
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:09,995
The food at this institution is not fit for
sub-species consumption, let alone humans.

853
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,366
One at a time, boys, please I am alone here.

854
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,165
Are you okay?

855
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,267
Oh my God!

856
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,405
What's wrong with him?

857
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,484
You know, I'm certainly no medical expert, but...

858
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,349
...from the looks of it...

859
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,714
I'd say... He's dying!

860
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,201
It's moved from his throat!

861
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:46,293
Maybe it's a parasite.

862
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,371
I'm calling the nurse!

863
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:49,497
Don't leave me!

864
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:50,832
Not yet.

865
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,819
Stay away from the light...

866
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,921
Stay away from the light...

867
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:21,902
I think he's trying to confess.

868
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:24,533
Are you properly trained
in the giving of last rites?

869
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,199
I don't know.

870
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,335
Oh no! Don't go, Hank!..

871
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:29,476
Don't go...

872
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:33,016
GO!..He was so sweet--

873
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:34,244
I'm okay...

874
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,518
What's happening here?

875
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:38,651
Allergies.

876
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:40,015
They come and go.

877
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,024
You were very comforting, though.

878
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:46,827
Oh...you know...and on second thought...
the food is just fine.

879
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,467
You got the combination?

880
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:58,263
She might smell,
but at least her files are organized.

881
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,033
So, when do we do it?

882
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:01,344
After school.

883
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:04,211
We just broke into
the Vice Principal's office!

884
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,645
Knowing Smelker, she could parlay
that into my beheading.

885
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,552
Dammit Marquis,
don't wussy out on me.

886
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:12,020
Or do you like getting smacked
in the face by balls?

887
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:13,913
Don't answer that.

888
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:18,793
All I'm trying to say, if you want Brad to keep
wailing on you, then fine--

889
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:22,963
Wait, wait, NO!

890
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,360
Let me just see what's in his locker first,
then I'll decide.

891
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,309
Someone loves himself.

892
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:37,511
Hey! Wait up!

893
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:45,421
What's that?

894
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,982
The holy grail...

895
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,225
'Roid Rage.

896
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,655
He's been on it
for at least a year.

897
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,160
How do you know all this?

898
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,659
Toni Durazo, his fetching girlfriend,

899
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:00,399
sits next to me in photo.

900
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:03,306
Her best friend Rachel is behind me

901
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,069
and when notes pass, I'm the go-between.

902
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,206
Sometimes they don't bother to fold them.

903
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:08,578
And this one time, Toni asked me--

904
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:09,875
Okay, got it.

905
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,875
You can read and you've got
a hard-on for Toni.

906
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,448
So fascinating!

907
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:17,147
What do we do now exactly?

908
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:18,681
What do we do now?

909
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,282
A student taking steroids...

910
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,053
We blow the whistle.

911
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,696
Brad gets caught red handed & BOOM!

912
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:29,999
Expulsion. Poof!

913
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,934
Gone from Brickland like
a bad case of ringworm.

914
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,999
It's so perfect,
it makes me want to cry.

915
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:37,837
How?...

916
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,933
Does it go down, I mean?

917
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:43,034
Go down?

918
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,913
An anonymous tip.

919
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:50,587
Seize the day, Chance.

920
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,556
Rid our society from
pond-scum like Brad Harden.

921
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,426
Opportunities like this
don't come along every day.

922
00:59:56,426 --> 01:00:00,362
So remember,
it's survival of the smartest.

923
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,770
I know where you live, Dorkus.

924
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,206
Hey, lighten up.

925
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,137
I don't really think you're a dorkus.

926
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:14,608
I know you don't.

927
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,514
Why is it you so often
forget my superior intellect...

928
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:21,751
and nascent ability to process your rudimentary
attempts at sarcasm?--

929
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:24,515
Shut it! Before I
purposely drive into a pole.

930
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,013
So, um...

931
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,923
...when did you know you were...

932
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:35,562
...you know...

933
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,562
A homosexual?

934
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:42,327
I don't know. When did you know
you were a breeder?

935
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,768
Still not completely sure if I am.

936
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:48,505
I've set for eighteen to twenty-three
to be my 'experimental years.'

937
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:49,769
I have a plan.

938
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:52,779
Four.

939
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,576
Four what?

940
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:57,614
When I was four,

941
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:02,421
my dear-departed mother took me to a
production of <i>The Nutcracker.</i>

942
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:06,490
It was colorful, and dramatic
and the music was great.

943
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,556
But just one thing held my attention
above everything else:

944
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,426
a dancer.

945
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:14,702
Male.

946
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,435
Shirtless through the entire play.

947
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,370
I couldn't stop looking at him.

948
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:27,341
Of course, I didn't really understand
why then, but...

949
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:30,779
I do now.

950
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,721
Very touching, Marquis.

951
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,721
Excuse me while I vomit.

952
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,329
Look, I don't care if you're gay,

953
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:42,365
but most people in school do.

954
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:42,854
So...

955
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,164
It's just...

956
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,202
If that alone
makes you such a huge target,

957
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:53,364
why do you give 'em more ammo
by acting and dressing the way you do?

958
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:56,369
Well,

959
01:01:56,813 --> 01:02:00,149
if you have the choice between being
ostracized for wearing a weird hat,

960
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:00,911
or being gay...

961
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:03,548
which one would you pick?

962
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:06,948
Thanks for the ride home.

963
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,785
And thanks for looking out for me.

964
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:31,238
I loved your football pictures in the paper.

965
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:33,873
You did?

966
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,016
Thanks.

967
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:42,788
Can I see?

968
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:44,221
Umm...

969
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:49,722
Sure.

970
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:53,296
These are great.

971
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:55,565
Who is this? Your sister?

972
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:57,602
Not exactly.

973
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:04,146
Is that...

974
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,180
...Chance?

975
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,254
Yeah!

976
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:16,859
We went to this club in the city and he
performed with a bunch of other drag queens.

977
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:18,383
It was great!

978
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:20,252
He was awesome!

979
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,497
Did you take these for the school paper?

980
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:29,763
No. I'm just developing them for Chance.

981
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:31,203
I mean...

982
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:34,267
I don't think he really wants
anyone to know...

983
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:35,172
you know?

984
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:36,105
Oh,

985
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:37,972
sure, yeah.

986
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,179
His secret's safe with me.

987
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,913
Umm... Hey, do you have

988
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,854
any high-gloss paper I could borrow?

989
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,181
Sure...

990
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:53,084
Oh, I left it in the classroom.

991
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:58,233
I'll go get it.

992
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:19,021
All I know is I didn't risk my life
sneaking into Smelt-her's office

993
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,455
to get information you're not
even gonna use now!

994
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:22,553
But...

995
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:25,094
I continue to appreciate the
creation of the plan

996
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,925
and its stealth-like deployment.

997
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,232
Yours is a leadership even my
father would hold dear.

998
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,364
But I hate to point out the fact that you
didn't actually risk your life.

999
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,304
Have you ever been in that office?

1000
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,902
It took everything in me
to avoid asphyxiation.

1001
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:46,381
Point taken.

1002
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,476
So you're just gonna let Brad
keep beating on you?

1003
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,346
UHH! Ahh!

1004
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:54,223
Look, I've been
in this situation before...

1005
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:57,715
eventually Brad will get tired of me and
move on to helpless freshmen.

1006
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,092
Puppies.

1007
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:00,663
And speaking frankly...

1008
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:01,931
tattletale-ing is beneath me.

1009
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:03,091
And you for that matter.

1010
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,496
He's not going to move on, Chance.

1011
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,003
I know his kind.

1012
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:10,769
Brad is like a cat toying with a mouse
before going in for the kill.

1013
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:17,914
You act like
none of this stuff bothers you,

1014
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,142
like it's a nuisance.

1015
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,417
You talk a good game.

1016
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:25,717
It even made me think that you were
strong...like everyone underestimates you.

1017
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:28,157
But that's all it is:

1018
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:29,146
talk.

1019
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,116
You're a coward, Chance.

1020
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:33,018
A mouse.

1021
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,927
Brad's mouse.

1022
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,533
Marquis, you're out!

1023
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:42,530
Dear students,

1024
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:46,208
do not forget
your essays for next Monday.

1025
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:51,506
You should write 500 words,
not less,

1026
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,750
and I have a
very nice reading task for you:

1027
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:58,015
you should read Act One of Macbeth,

1028
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:01,417
one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies.

1029
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:04,587
There is also a reminder
on the blackboard,

1030
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:07,590
you do not use cliff notes, okay?

1031
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:10,494
Time for literature now...

1032
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:14,532
this book: <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>

1033
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:19,237
written by Alexandre Dumas...

1034
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:23,442
Oh man, Boy-George is so going to wish he
never stepped foot in this school.

1035
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:41,127
Hey Cadet,...

1036
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:43,198
come on in here.

1037
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,261
I thought we'd do this together.

1038
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:48,225
Hai!

1039
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:11,925
You gotta be tough, Chance.

1040
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:14,153
It's the only way
to survive in this life.

1041
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,891
Did it ever occur to you that maybe
I already am tough?

1042
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,901
What? No, that's not what I meant-

1043
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:19,595
I didn't think so.

1044
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,070
But then again, why would you

1045
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:24,106
when you've spent your entire adult life
being trained to discern that

1046
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:25,937
which is only directly in
front of your face?

1047
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,911
So when you look at me,
all you see is everything you aren't.

1048
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:30,079
And would never want to be.

1049
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,341
You don't see strength...

1050
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:34,483
just cowardice and, let's face it, a big fag!

1051
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:35,618
So if you'll excuse me,

1052
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:37,677
I have a field of daisies
to go frolic through!

1053
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,955
What did I tell you about using
that word in this house!

1054
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:52,331
Hey, my girlfriend needs some lipstick,
can you help her out?

1055
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:31,930
Someone must have swiped it.

1056
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,069
Perceptive beyond belief.

1057
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,137
It's impossible.

1058
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:36,365
I was extra careful.

1059
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:38,963
No one even saw them, except for...

1060
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:42,511
Oh...

1061
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:44,713
Oh...

1062
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,782
Before you say anything,

1063
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:51,613
just remember, she's very fetching.

1064
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:54,190
And I'm a teenager in high school

1065
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,589
who's not having sex.

1066
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:59,254
You showed these to Toni Durazo?!

1067
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:03,065
She's Brad's girlfriend...

1068
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:04,600
you idiot!

1069
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,761
What are you,
sniffing on photo chemicals again?!

1070
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:11,663
It's like a voodoo spell, I think...

1071
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:15,044
Look on the positive side,

1072
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,672
it's definitely one of my better shots.

1073
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,505
Ow!

1074
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:23,580
It'll blow over.

1075
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,550
I don't know if you've noticed,
but this is high school.

1076
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:28,224
Things don't 'blow over'.

1077
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,055
They stay with you forever...

1078
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,491
like low self-esteem.

1079
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,933
May I take this opportunity
to mention that

1080
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:41,369
an anonymous phone call is still
very much an option.

1081
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,273
The cat is no longer toying,

1082
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,434
and its teeth are
in the mouse's neck.

1083
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,672
It's not how I fight my battles.

1084
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,212
This isn't just going to go away....

1085
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:11,964
C'mon Marquis, English Lit rates
at least a ballroom gown, Man.

1086
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:20,706
So exactly how mad does your mom get
when you steal her bras, huh?

1087
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,546
...Or her tits, for that matter.

1088
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:25,843
Shut up!

1089
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:40,995
You do this sort of thing often?

1090
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:43,757
One time.

1091
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:47,161
That's all it usually takes.

1092
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,269
They can't handle this, you know...

1093
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:53,572
The students here.

1094
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:59,347
They tolerate the misfits among them,
but if you rub their faces in it...

1095
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:04,541
That's too much for the hormone-engorged
teenager to deal with.

1096
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,651
So now what?

1097
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,653
You need to find a way for
them to handle it.

1098
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:14,396
Otherwise,

1099
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:17,229
I don't really see a future for you
here at Brickland.

1100
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,527
This will excuse you
for the rest of the week.

1101
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,000
Use the time to think.

1102
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,377
We'll have the flyers removed.

1103
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:42,651
Where's your brother?

1104
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,520
Said he's not feeling well.

1105
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:57,303
Hi.

1106
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,373
Is, uh, Chance around?

1107
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:00,608
Who are you?

1108
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:02,538
He's Chance's ex-friend from next door.

1109
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,543
He has his own band.

1110
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:06,671
Chance is upstairs.

1111
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:22,654
Here to revel in Brad's victory?

1112
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:24,996
Kind of a tough day, huh?

1113
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:28,103
Why? Were you
tarred and feathered, too?

1114
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:29,195
I hadn't noticed.

1115
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:31,962
Look,

1116
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:35,008
I'm the first to admit
Brad crossed a line.

1117
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:37,878
What he did was...

1118
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:41,012
...was expose me for who I really am?

1119
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:43,950
Maybe I should be thanking him.

1120
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:45,854
This might surprise you, Levi,

1121
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:47,788
but I'm not embarassed
about what happened.

1122
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:49,917
If you say so.

1123
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:54,862
It just sort of looked that way when you
were ripping that flyer off the wall.

1124
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,963
So now everyone thinks I'm ashamed of
the fact that I dressed in drag.

1125
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,365
Like it was some horrible secret.

1126
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,041
When the truth is, the guy
who goes to school every day...

1127
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:07,372
he's the lie.

1128
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:12,378
Why do I let it be okay for people
to think less of me?

1129
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:17,675
...for my friends just to decide they
no longer wanna be my friends.

1130
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:23,855
Man, I take all of it..

1131
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,923
and I try to rise above it.

1132
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:31,689
But I don't think you're supposed
to do that in high school.

1133
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:34,997
Nothing heroic ever came of 'rising above it.'

1134
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,830
Hey! What do you write in that?

1135
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:42,774
My brilliant and insightful thoughts.

1136
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:47,979
And some poems, song lyrics...

1137
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:49,485
Lyrics?

1138
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:50,543
You write songs?

1139
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,044
What?

1140
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:55,983
C'mon. Suddenly you're shy?

1141
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,260
I thought they were
brilliant and insightful.

1142
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,227
They are.

1143
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:01,156
And potentially highly embarrassing.

1144
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:07,534
Hey, you know what?

1145
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,396
Why don't we write a song.

1146
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:12,030
I'll do the music, you write the lyrics.

1147
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:14,264
Okay.

1148
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:21,213
I thought your father banned
music from your heart.

1149
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,815
Oh yeah, that.

1150
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:29,017
Well, like you said,
I have to stand up to him someday.

1151
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:33,821
So...Screw Lawrence and his scholarships.

1152
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:39,223
So... Are we cool?

1153
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:52,337
Chance?!

1154
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,982
Is your brother really sick?

1155
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,216
Okay, what's the deal?

1156
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:08,096
Apparently his entire school

1157
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:10,587
found out he dressed up in drag
and performed at a club.

1158
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:12,100
What?!

1159
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:14,761
Then they put his picture
on a bunch of flyers

1160
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:19,197
labelling him an embarrassment to all that is
held holy in the high school male.

1161
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:24,075
Why can't you kids have normal problems?

1162
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:25,538
Like acne.

1163
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:28,574
Time for school.

1164
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,824
Well, he's not at the loser-table...

1165
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,192
...he wasn't in Lit...

1166
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:44,430
Looks like
'Operation: Get-Rid-Of-Fag' worked.

1167
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:47,863
Stop calling him that.

1168
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:51,037
What'd you say Sparks?

1169
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:53,402
This wasn't cool.

1170
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:56,439
If he wants to dress up like a girl,
that's his business.

1171
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:02,046
How'd you like it if everyone knew you fooled
around with Kenny Ellis in sixth grade?

1172
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,888
So tell me Sparks,

1173
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:08,913
when exactly did you grow a pair, huh?

1174
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,956
When I figured out
you don't really have friends.

1175
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:15,227
Just subjects who live in fear of you.

1176
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,291
You don't want to do this, Man.

1177
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:20,792
Trust me,

1178
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:22,969
you don't want to go there with me.

1179
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:26,233
You know what, Brad?
I feel sorry for you.

1180
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,439
Because right here, right now...

1181
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:32,445
is the best it'll ever be for you.

1182
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,839
Well, you never were too bright.

1183
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:42,280
Take your best shot.

1184
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,156
Brad!

1185
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:53,962
Are you okay?

1186
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,094
Oh my God, you're like... bleeding.

1187
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:02,167
Yeah, that's what I thought would happen.

1188
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:12,581
Are you looking for something?

1189
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:14,719
Inspiration.

1190
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:29,663
You know, Chance, there's a link
between inspiration and perspiration.

1191
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,405
What you need is focus.

1192
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:37,546
How about I send you back Stateside.

1193
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,614
I found a military academy
in the Midwest--

1194
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:40,876
Please...

1195
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:42,545
Just stop.

1196
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:47,379
I'm never gonna understand you the way
your mother did, I know that.

1197
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:49,251
Well, I don't need you to.

1198
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:50,822
Then, what do you need?

1199
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,823
For you to stop running this house
like a military operation.

1200
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:58,194
We're not a team, we're a family.

1201
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:03,165
Sienna and I,
we're not your soldiers or cadets.

1202
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,870
We're your kids.

1203
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:09,678
No kid I know enjoys discipline.
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

1204
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:11,270
I'm not talking about discipline.

1205
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:13,044
I don't mind rules.

1206
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:15,274
But you need to let me be
who I'm gonna be.

1207
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,015
I think I do.

1208
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:21,388
Except every time you look at me, all I see
is you wishing I were someone else.

1209
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:23,154
Anyone else.

1210
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:26,427
Nothing about me makes you proud.

1211
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:29,695
How do you know that?

1212
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:35,132
Because every time you look at Sienna, I see
exactly what that pride looks like.

1213
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:41,934
Put this stuff away when you're done.

1214
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:20,703
What?!

1215
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:23,180
Have you talked to Chance?...

1216
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:25,287
'cause he won't return our calls.

1217
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:28,222
Yeah, we've gotta make sure he didn't kill
himself.

1218
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,221
You're a photographer, right?

1219
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:34,027
What gave it away?

1220
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,127
Who are you?

1221
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,864
We're scared of her.

1222
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:45,339
Meet me here, after school today.

1223
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,269
And bring that.

1224
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:51,612
Can we stop following him now?

1225
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:53,771
Okay, c'mon.

1226
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:13,122
Hey guys!

1227
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,536
What's this?

1228
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:15,594
New band:

1229
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,032
'Dramatic Pause.'

1230
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:19,074
Chance is our lead singer.

1231
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:20,507
Wow! That's neat.

1232
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:23,135
We need some band photos -
for flyers and stuff.

1233
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,212
Can you do it?

1234
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,180
Yeah, sure I can.

1235
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:29,818
We're competing at
the battle of the bands

1236
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:30,785
and we require a manager.

1237
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:32,479
Interested?

1238
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:33,622
Manager?

1239
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:36,022
You're a high-school band
doing Toto covers...

1240
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:37,292
badly.

1241
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:39,852
What you really need is to be
put out of your misery.

1242
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:48,464
I'm in.

1243
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,164
Cool.

1244
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:41,790
Whoa...

1245
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,350
This is a whole lot of people!

1246
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:51,197
Hey! Listen, I arranged for some insurance
to make sure Dramatic Pause stands out.

1247
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:52,801
You bought off the judges?!

1248
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:53,768
Even better-

1249
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,597
You... killed the judges?

1250
01:22:56,838 --> 01:22:59,398
Will you just shut up and listen?!

1251
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:19,052
Where's Chance?

1252
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:20,953
With you...

1253
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:23,260
Weren't you picking him up?

1254
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:29,797
So, what are we supposed to do
if Chance doesn't show?

1255
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:35,767
Hi, Lawrence.

1256
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,872
Do you know about that?

1257
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:41,616
When did this happen?

1258
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:43,743
It's been brewing
for the past two weeks, or so.

1259
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:46,186
Levi and Chance wrote a song together.

1260
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:48,180
Is it any good?

1261
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:49,958
I haven't heard it yet.

1262
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:52,327
Look, Levi's grounded,
and now he's gone.

1263
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:54,659
And I'm willing to bet your son has
got something to do with that.

1264
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:56,765
I wanna talk to him right now-

1265
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:58,232
Chance isn't here.

1266
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:00,591
His band goes on at five.

1267
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:01,859
Can we go?

1268
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:05,865
Get your coat.

1269
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:08,138
But wait, I have to get changed first.

1270
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:16,277
You know what someone should really invent?
Portable phones.

1271
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:20,455
C'mon, let's go and see
if we can find him.

1272
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:22,787
You go over there and you
check back there, okay?

1273
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:33,934
Chance!

1274
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:35,729
You guys, go look up there.

1275
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:37,602
Chance?!

1276
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:49,545
Maybe it's better if we split up.

1277
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,254
Chance!

1278
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:01,362
Where were you?

1279
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:02,829
We were starting to think you bailed.

1280
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:04,466
Oh look,

1281
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:05,834
it's the Flock-of-Faggots.

1282
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:07,631
What are you playing,
'Disco Up The Ass'?

1283
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,902
Have you seen Levi anywhere?

1284
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,402
I don't see either of them.

1285
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,680
Is that Chance over there?

1286
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:49,502
Look at them, they're spectacular!

1287
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,421
What are you doing up here?

1288
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:02,048
Nice introduction, your idea?

1289
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:04,952
I can't go on...

1290
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:06,227
Why?

1291
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:06,989
What's wrong?

1292
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:09,763
Stage fright is my best guess.

1293
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:12,062
Or maybe an intestinal parasite.

1294
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:13,727
Ladies...

1295
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:18,538
Okay, you hormonal mess of a crowd,

1296
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:20,673
are you ready for the next band?!

1297
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:27,506
Please welcome my Rockettes!

1298
01:26:29,617 --> 01:26:31,585
What the hell is that?!

1299
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,654
A chorus line, duh!

1300
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,546
Aren't they fabulous?

1301
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:38,749
I said, aren't they FABULOUS!

1302
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:45,433
Listen to me.

1303
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:48,002
If singing in a dress and high-heels
in front of two-hundred drunks

1304
01:26:48,002 --> 01:26:51,460
isn't going to prepare you for this,
then nothing ever will.

1305
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:52,707
This is cake!

1306
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:54,174
You don't understand...

1307
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:56,834
pretending to be someone else is easy.

1308
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:59,647
It's an act...dress-up.

1309
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:01,216
I can hide behind top hats--

1310
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,047
I thought you were done hiding.

1311
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:05,643
Don't you want them
to see the real Chance?

1312
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:08,752
Just go out there and sing.

1313
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,357
Great advice.

1314
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:12,994
And besides,
if they start throwing anything,

1315
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:15,394
it'll be at Levi
and his lousy guitar playing.

1316
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:19,824
Just stand up to all of 'em.

1317
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:21,632
Now's your chance.

1318
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:23,701
Stand up.

1319
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:30,545
So, I want you all to put your hands
together for the next band.

1320
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:33,414
It's led by a close, personal friend of mine.

1321
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,350
And honeys, if you like good music,

1322
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:38,046
you can turn on the radio after the concert.

1323
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:43,214
In the meantime, here they are...
in all their Oxy-cream glory:

1324
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:45,725
The Dramatic Pause!

1325
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:19,661
I live in a different world

1326
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:23,188
See things my own way

1327
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:27,425
Got no shame for what I do

1328
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:30,895
What else should I say

1329
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:34,674
Who do we become

1330
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:38,811
Add up all the sums

1331
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:43,046
Part of me will be okay

1332
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:46,510
The rest will be undone

1333
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:49,324
Stand Up for all of your dreams

1334
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,426
Leave the ones that have been

1335
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:53,428
See how far we have come

1336
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:55,563
Never have to succumb

1337
01:28:55,563 --> 01:28:57,765
Take your friends by your side

1338
01:28:57,765 --> 01:28:59,600
And just go for that ride

1339
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,070
Don't worry who you are

1340
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,402
Stand Up and you'll go far

1341
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:08,905
Stand Up and you'll go far

1342
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:14,978
Some people have all the luck

1343
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:18,184
Born with looks and a buck

1344
01:29:19,587 --> 01:29:22,954
And then there is the rest of us

1345
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:26,518
The strange and messed up

1346
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:30,392
You think you are one

1347
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:34,325
Boy you sure are dumb

1348
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:38,906
Look at us and then decide

1349
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,341
Who is Jekyll, who is Hyde?

1350
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:45,012
Stand Up for all of your dreams

1351
01:29:45,012 --> 01:29:46,948
Leave the ones that have been

1352
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:49,050
See how far you can go

1353
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,779
Then get ready to blow--

1354
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:52,577
Mr. Harden!

1355
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:55,712
I want a word with you.

1356
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,087
Care to explain?!

1357
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:10,438
Stand Up for all of your dreams

1358
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:12,473
Leave the ones that have been

1359
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:14,409
See how far you can go

1360
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,677
Then get ready to blow

1361
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:18,513
Take the low-times in stride

1362
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:20,548
Bring the high-times inside

1363
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:23,217
Don't worry who you are

1364
01:30:23,217 --> 01:30:25,447
Stand Up and you'll go far

1365
01:30:26,954 --> 01:30:30,151
Stand Up and you'll go far

1366
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:33,460
Stand Up and you'll go far

1367
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:38,125
Stand Up and you'll go far

1368
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,332
Stand Up and you'll go far

1369
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:46,031
Stand Up and you'll go far

1370
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:19,973
Why didn't you tell me you had a band?

1371
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:22,905
I didn't think you were ready
for another singer in the family.

1372
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:29,179
Well, maybe you should let me decide what
I may or may not be ready for.

1373
01:31:30,718 --> 01:31:32,811
But thanks for looking out for me.

1374
01:31:35,289 --> 01:31:36,551
I got your back.

1375
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:40,257
I'm sorry, I haven't always had yours.

1376
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:44,092
You were great out there today, Son.

1377
01:31:46,734 --> 01:31:48,793
You know,
they have bands in the Army...

1378
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:52,964
Think about it.

1379
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:54,131
Go.

1380
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,218
Expelled?

1381
01:32:04,218 --> 01:32:06,277
As in, total expulsion?

1382
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:10,858
And the best part is,
the idiot practically tumed himself in.

1383
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:14,195
He started raging at a practice while
Smelt-her was watching...

1384
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,163
so, she got suspicious.

1385
01:32:16,163 --> 01:32:17,562
Hey, Twyla...

1386
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:22,770
Oh hey, don't forget about the gig
I booked you on Saturday night.

1387
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:24,338
My cousin Claudia's wedding.

1388
01:32:24,338 --> 01:32:27,501
So start boning up
on your Barry Manilow.

1389
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:33,575
Hey, I got concert photos for you.

1390
01:32:33,648 --> 01:32:34,672
Oh good!

1391
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:39,948
Thank you.

1392
01:32:45,159 --> 01:32:46,524
Anything else?

1393
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:49,730
You want to know what's inside?

1394
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:51,258
Of course.

1395
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:52,633
But you can't tell me.

1396
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:53,634
To wit, Hank:

1397
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:56,228
should I become privy, and Smelker finds out...

1398
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:59,835
and finds some way to circumvent
standard administrative protocol

1399
01:33:00,007 --> 01:33:03,966
and torture me to the point where I have no
choice but to reveal what I know.

1400
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:06,539
Torture...

1401
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:08,476
Torture.

1402
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:11,349
Good point.

1403
01:33:17,224 --> 01:33:19,249
<i>I know you wanted to know...</i>

1404
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,955
<i>but I think my well-being supersedes your</i>
<i>low-minded curiosity in this case.</i>

1405
01:34:05,072 --> 01:34:08,838
<i>I know what you're thinking:</i>
<i>another 'Chance-Fantasy-Sequence.'</i>

1406
01:34:09,243 --> 01:34:11,143
<i>Maybe...maybe not.</i>

1407
01:34:11,445 --> 01:34:13,504
<i>But, let's be clear about one thing,</i>

1408
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,809
<i>this is my version of the story...</i>

1409
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:28,854
<i>I told you, you were in for some perspective...</i>

1410
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:30,698
<i>No doubt about it...</i>

1411
01:34:30,698 --> 01:34:33,633
<i>high school's mostly irritating</i>
<i>and an abomination.</i>

1412
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:35,861
<i>But, you make the best of it...</i>
