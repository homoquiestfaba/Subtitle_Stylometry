00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,360 
[gasps]

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,800 
Careful, numbskull!

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,120 
These trophies are a symbol
of my excellence as a teacher.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,280 
It took me 754 years to collect them all.

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,920 
[mumbles]

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,000 
What was that?

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,440 
Hello! "Favorite teacher award"?

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,440 
It's like the best one and stuff,
but you'll never win it.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,320 
Why not?

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,480 
Because you need a letter of
recommendation from a student who, uh...

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,120 
-actually likes you.
-That sounds easy enough.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,400 
Seriously, though, no one likes you,
Miss Simian-- not even me!

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,800 
And I like<i> everybody.</i>

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,880 
Nobody likes me?

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,440 
Hmm?

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,000 
Dude, I think something's wrong
with Miss Simian.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,040 
What makes you say that?

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,440 
She hasn't told anyone off all day.

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,000 
[all creating a ruckus]

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,800 
That<i> is </i>weird.

-[alarm bell ringing]
-[people cheering]

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,320 
Hey, guys! Wait up!

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,800 
Gumball?

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,800 
Yeah...

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,880 
You and I are friends, right?

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,040 
Are we?

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,600 
Well, what with all the detentions
and everything,

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,560 
I guess we spend a lot of time together.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,640 
Uh, I guess so.

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760 
-Anyway, gotta go.
-Just one more thing.

32
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,560 
Would you mind if I hang out
with you just for a little while?

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,440 
Uh, yeah.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,880 
Yeah, I would.

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,040 
Basically, she asked to be my friend.

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,400 
Well, I told her "No," obviously.

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,520 
But now she's just following me around.

38
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,400 
And the strangest thing is,
she's completely unresponsive.

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,479 
Watch. See? Nothing!

40
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,360 
Hmm.

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,160 
Try something hot.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,520 
Is she still there?

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,800 
Yep.

44
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,440 
Shoo-shoo. Shoo!

45
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,080 
Huh.

46
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,800 
Fetch!

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,880 
[sighs] I hope things get better tomorrow.

48
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,800 
[loud slurping]

49
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,640 
What is she doing in my house?

50
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,480 
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,720 
I just thought that maybe we could share
a nice breakfast together,

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,640 
but since you all hate me, I'll just go.

53
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,600 
I'm walking.

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,880 
It's so sad.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,360 
This is me... on my way.

56
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,040 
I'm at the door.

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,680 
This is kind of harsh.

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,640 
I'm turning the doorknob.

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,200 
I'm opening the door.

60
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,240 
I don't know why, but I'm crying!

61
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,880 
Boy, it sure looks lonely out there.

62
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,120 
Mom, why do you hate Miss Simian so much?

63
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,920 
I don't want to talk about it.

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,400 
Please let her stay!

65
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,560 
[Darwin crying]

66
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,920 
OK. She can stay, but--

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,240 
Oh, thank you!
You're such a kind and friendly family!

68
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,840 
You know, I've never had friends before.

69
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,640 
I don't even know what friends do.

70
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,120 
Don't worry.

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,560 
We'll show you.

72
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,480 
Now, a very important part
of friendship is sharing.

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,480 
Imagine you both have ice creams.

74
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,440 
[Darwin and Simian] Oh.

75
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,840 
But what's this?

76
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,040 
Darwin has dropped his ice cream.

77
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,920 
I said, "Darwin has dropped
his ice cream."

78
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,240 
You got it on my shoes.

79
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,640 
Do you want to share mine?

80
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,080 
Ah. Very good.

81
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,800 
Ice cream, Darwin?

82
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,720 
Oh, thanks!

83
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,360 
But, Gumball,<i> you </i>don't have an ice cream.

84
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,480 
Want to share mine?

85
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,480 
Sure.

86
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040 
Dude, this is so gross!

87
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040 
Why don't you pretend
you have your own ice cream?

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,959 
Ugh. Why didn't<i> I </i>think of that?

89
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,680 
Friends also high-five, like this.

90
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,000 
[both] High-five!

91
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,000 
OK, now--

92
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120 
No, I meant slap my--

93
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,560 
Let's move on to the next lesson.

94
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,680 
How about we all play a game,
like friends do?

95
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,200 
Here's one we made up.

96
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,480 
-It's called dodge or dare!
-Dodge or dare!

97
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,720 
Roll the dice.

98
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,440 
Take a card.

99
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,200 
What'd you get?

100
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,280 
"Put a gooey hair ball
in Miss Simian's lunch."

101
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,440 
L-- let me take that. Pick another.

102
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,360 
"When Miss Simian's back is turned--"

103
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,680 
A-- actually, let me pick one for you.

104
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,680 
"Cover Simian in slug juice,
drop water balloons on Simian,

105
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,440 
Miss Simian, Miss Simian, Miss Simian--"

106
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,880 
Forget the cards. Here's a dare.

107
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,800 
Make the most annoying noise possible.

108
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720 
[bleats]

109
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,600 
OK.

110
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,240 
That was good,
but we know that you can do better.

111
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,480 
Like when you're mad at us.

112
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,920 
Oh, you mean this little thing?

113
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,880 
Gumball!

114
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,160 
[both] That... was... awesome!

115
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560 
High-five!

116
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,880 
That still needs a little work.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,160 
I've got my eye on you, Simian.

118
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,560 
[fart noise]

119
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,040 
Do it again! Do it again!

120
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,120 
I'm so pleased to finally have
such great friends!

121
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,680 
[all] Aww, we love you, Miss Simian.

122
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,480 
Sorry, kids.
Miss Simian, can I have a word

123
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,440 
with you in private, please?

124
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,440 
Yes, Nicole, how can I help you?

125
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,920 
Listen, Simian,
you might have the rest of them fooled

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,680 
but I don't trust you for a second.

127
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,440 
I remember you from school.
I remember the horrible name you

128
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,040 
used to call me every day.

129
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,320 
Do you remember that?

130
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,280 
-Yes, I do. And I'm sorry.
-What?

131
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,720 
I was that horrid person for so long,
and look where it got me.

132
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,280 
No friends, no family--
just bitterness and wrinkles.

133
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,680 
But even an old ape can change.

134
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,120 
Will you give me that chance?

135
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,480 
Oh, I don't know.
It's all happening so fast.

136
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,600 
Please?

137
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,440 
OK, I'll-- I'll give it another shot.

138
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,480 
What do we do now, best friends?

139
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,000 
Uh, let's see. I know!

140
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,560 
Best friends write letters to each other
about how great they are.

141
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,160 
Wow! What a... friendly idea.

142
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,320 
What shall we write?

143
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,440 
Uh...

144
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,640 
How about
"We, the aforementioned,

145
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,760 
unanimously agree
that Miss Simian is worthy

146
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,720 
of this year's favorite teacher award."

147
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520 
"Favorite teacher award." OK! Done it!

148
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,640 
[laughs hysterically]

149
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,360 
It's mine!

150
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,920 
-[upbeat music playing]
-[scatting]

151
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,560 
Look how happy she is.

152
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,000 
That's the power of friendship.

153
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,320 
Wow! You baked that cake for Miss Simian?

154
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,800 
Yeah. I think she deserves
a second chance.

155
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960 
-Is Miss Simian around?
-Nah, dude.

156
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,320 
[chuckles] She just drove off.

157
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,680 
You should have seen her,
all dancing and laughing,

158
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,840 
saying she finally got some losers

159
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,640 
to write her
a favorite teacher nomination.

160
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,560 
[all gasp]

161
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,520 
What was the word she used?

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,880 
[in slow-mo] "Losers."

163
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,240 
Nice first steps, loser!

164
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,760 
Nice cycling, loser!

165
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,240 
Nice "poem," loser!

166
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,960 
Nice hair, loser.

167
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,320 
Nice husband, loser! [laughing]

168
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,440 
Everyone, get back in the car.

169
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,080 
Now?

170
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,840 
[laughing]

171
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,920 
Soon, the trophy will be mine.

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,320 
We'll see about that,
you two-faced baboon!

173
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,760 
There's nothing
you can do about it, loser!

174
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,400 
Mom! What are you doing?

175
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,080 
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

176
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,200 
[tires screeching]

177
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,200 
[thuds]

Not as dangerous
as disobeying your mother!

Sorry!

Do what?

196
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,840 
I'll get closer,

Miss Simian, no!

You could still be friends with us
if you like.

Oh, just Simian taking a little tumble.

Maybe that'll teach her
for "monkeying around."

We shouldn't laugh.
She may be seriously hurt.

Well, you shouldn't have
"gibbon" her a second chance.

232
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,520 
No, really. That's enough.

233

Well, she shouldn't have
"orangu-tangled" with us.

I said that's enough.

But that's your fifth box.

Well, it's because, uh, I'm growing?

247

Well, could you try and grow slower?

This is costing me a fortune. Thanks.

Richard, what are you doing
in the cupboard?

Shh. I'm hiding from the ghost.
This house is haunted! [whimpers]

-Mr. Robinson?
-Mr. Robinson?

Yep. I found him in the shed,
so I put him up here in the attic,

261
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,080 
where I've provided him
with full en suite dining,

unlimited beverages, and a queen-size bed.

263

You do realize
what keeping a 50-year-old man

264
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,600

I don't know.
He hasn't said a word since I found him.

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,080 
-Nope.
-[Nicole] Richard.

356
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,800 
Richard! Please look at me!

357
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,920 
First he takes my sausages, and then what?
Should I let him take my wife?

358
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,800 
A man's house is his castle, Nicole.

359
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,680 
And this is a castle,
and I'm not letting him ruin it.

360
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,200 
There's a phantom in our bed,
and before you know it...

361
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,720 
Richard, by all means, be hysterical,
but please don't forget to breathe.

362
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,000 
...a giant earwig!

363
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,319 
[breathes deeply]

364
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,720 
And the next thing you know,
he'll come for the kids-- the kids!

365
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,040 
There are no such things as ghosts.

366
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,240 
-Richard, calm down.
<i>-You </i>calm down, Nicole!

367
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,119 
-Richard, please don't...
-Ah...

368
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,680 
Margaret and I used to argue
like that--

369
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,720 
sometimes up to six times a day,

370
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,160 
<i>from first thing in the morning,</i>
<i>until last thing at night.</i>

371
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,960 
<i>In the kitchen, in the backyard,</i>

372
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,480 
<i>in the car,</i>

373
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,680 
<i>occasionally, we'd do it in public,</i>

374
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,560 
<i>once even while we were sleeping.</i>
[chuckles]

375
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,600 
But what happened?

376
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,160 
I don't know.

377
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,840 
Something changed.

378
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,360 
<i>And one day, she said the spark</i>
<i>had gone and asked me to leave.</i>

379
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,680 
That's when you found me in the shed.

380
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,800 
So<i> that's </i>what's wrong with Mr. Robinson.

381
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,440 
He lost his anger.

382
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,880 
-Look!
-Yeah, that looks more like it.

383
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,720 
We're gonna sort this out.

384
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,280 
-How?
-Leave that to us.

385
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,160 
But first, we got to get you out of here.

386
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,440 
Breathe in, breathe out.

387
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,960 
Breathe in, breathe out.

388
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,160 
Are you sure about this?

389
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,200 
Don't worry. You're in safe hands. Ready?

390
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,280 
Breathe in, breathe--

391
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,480 
[screams]

392
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,760 
Enough!

393
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,800 
[groans]

394
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,640 
[humming]

395
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,000 
Hmm. I'm not sure what he sees
in that woman, but anyway...

396
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,400 
Come on, Mr. Robinson!
Let's show her you still got it!

397
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,200 
OK, now go ballistic.

398
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,040 
I can't, kids. I'm not that man anymore.

399
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,000 
Then we'll do it for you.

400
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,320 
Hey, you! Mr. Robinson's wife!

401
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,040 
Come and have an argument with him!

402
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,680 
I mean... me!

403
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,520 
We're gonna have a fight,
and you're gonna like it!

404
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,400 
How do you like my arguing, huh?

405
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,880 
See how angry I am?

406
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,600 
[muttering]

407
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,080 
[sighs]

408
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,880 
You made it worse.

409
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,240 
I didn't think it was possible,
but you made it worse.

410
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,760 
[crying]

411
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,960 
[Richard screams]

412
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,400 
The ghost!
He's about to attack the children!

413
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,960 
-This is for attacking my kids!
-[grunting]

414
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,320 
And this... is... for... my... sausage!

415
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840 
-Dad!
-Now get out of my garden!

416
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,920 
-Stop it! Stop it! It's Mr. Robinson!
-[groans]

417
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,640 
Oh, sorry!

418
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,560 
Ow.

419
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,240 
[heart pounding]

420
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,120 
Aarrgh!

421
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,440 
Show yourself, ghost of Mr. Robinson!

422
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,280 
Hey, what's up, neighbor?

423
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,600 
I've had enough of this family!

424
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,200 
Your tacky lifestyle, your ugly house,
your cheap garden shed!

425
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,200 
I'll smash it to pieces!

426
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,720 
[grunting]

427
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,120 
[panting]

428
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,000 
It's more solid than I thought.

429
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,280 
But this is what I do
to your unfashionable deck chairs!

430
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,320 
Gosh darn it!

431
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,320 
[pants]

432
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,000 
And as for your crummy
thrift store vacuum cleaner--

433
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080 
Buy cheap...

434
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,080 
Buy twice!

435
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,880 
And this is what I think

436
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,000 
of your $2 clip-on tie!

437
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,200 
[cackling]

438
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,720 
I'm back!

439
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,720 
And as for you...

440
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,840 
[both laughing and mumbling]

441
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,480 
[both] Yay!

442
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,840 
[both] Welcome back, Mr. Robinson!

443
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,760 
Thanks.

444
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,400 
So, since we saved
your marriage and everything,

445
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,400 
I guess that makes us
best friends forever?

446
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,200 
So can we call you Gaylord
instead of Mr. Robinson?

447
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,360 
Don't push it, kid.

448
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,280 
Now, take me home, woman.

449
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,520 
What was that all about?

450
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,520 
Well, there never was a ghost, Dad.

451
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,760 
-It was Mr. Robinson.
-We hid him in the attic.

452
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,880 
No.

453
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,760 
I mean, what's wrong with our house,
our shed, and my tie? [sniffles]

454
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,200 
[sighs] Dad, you know what I do
when I feel like a loser?

455
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,680 
I look at this.

456
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600 
Yeah.

457
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,440 
I feel better now.

458
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,360 
Who... Who does he think he is, anyway?

459
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,240 
"$2 clip-on tie."

460
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360 
At least I know how to treat my wife!

461
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,800 
[grunting]

462
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000 
[groans]

463
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,440 
[screams]

464
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,040 
Richard!
