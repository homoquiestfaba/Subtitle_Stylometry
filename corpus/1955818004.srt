1
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,665
[music playing]

2
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,137
[cheering]

3
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:18,739
Where's the groom?

4
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,284
What's, your name, honey?

5
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:31,185
Cooper.

6
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,841
AnYbOdY 90'! a quarter?

7
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,111
Yes, somewhere.

8
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,480
I got some quarters
for ya right here.

9
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:00,681
Wait.
Wait.

10
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:01,682
Wait.
Wait.

11
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:02,816
Wait, I got more.
- Oh, I got more.

12
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,717
I got--

13
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:04,585
Yes.

14
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,320
Yes, please.

15
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:07,221
It's raining!

16
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:35,916
[cheering]

17
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:05,045
Explain to me Why
housekeeping isn't doing this?

18
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,447
Because they don't
come until morning.

19
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,549
And I'm not sleeping
in this mess.

20
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,051
It's like a junkyard
in June in here.

21
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:19,827
Damn, it's hotter than
a-- help me out here.

22
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,728
Satan's armpit.

23
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,030
Uh, aluminum sweater.

24
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:23,998
Pepper spray douche.

25
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,566
Take your pick.

26
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,301
Uh, yeah.

27
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,269
Any of those will work fine.

28
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,169
Thanks.

29
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,074
You're staying here tonight?

30
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:36,710
I thought you were
crashing at casa de Cooper.

31
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,512
Well let's see.

32
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:42,049
A tiny couch with your
family snoring nearby,

33
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:45,552
or a plush, king size bed?

34
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,488
Not a tough decision.

35
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,223
Besides, it's paid for.

36
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,993
And after planning this
unseeingly exhibition

37
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:56,196
of bare boobery, I
think I'm entitled.

38
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,097
I bet you are.

39
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,132
And thanks, by the way.

40
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,566
I had a good time.

41
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:04,405
So tomorrow?

42
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,612
Lewis, I'm really sorry
about the best man thing.

43
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:12,880
It's OK.

44
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,382
I mean, we've only been
buds since junior high,

45
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,685
and you've known this
guy, what, a week now?

46
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,119
OK.
OK.

47
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,321
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

48
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,356
But Belinda asked if her
brother could be best man.

49
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,257
What was his name again?

50
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,158
Tweaky?

51
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,092
Twitchy?

52
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:26,026
Ted.

53
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,227
I noticed he
got really excited

54
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,163
about the pattern
in the bathroom,

55
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,398
until he realized it was talc.

56
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,267
Still, I think
half of it's gone.

57
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,501
I know, man, but--

58
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,870
And hey, the stripper's
studying to be a therapist.

59
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,038
We could have done
an intervention

60
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,873
while she was picking
the quarter of your nose

61
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,176
with her pussy.

62
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,444
Listen, you.

63
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,412
She's trying to integrate
him back into the family.

64
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:46,980
Using your wedding?

65
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,248
Yes.

66
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,517
Did you even tell her who
you wanted to be best man?

67
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,418
Well--

68
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:52,586
That's what I thought.

69
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,722
T-minus one day
and counting until

70
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,524
complete vaginal submission.

71
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,060
I promise I will
make it up to you.

72
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:00,961
How?

73
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:01,895
Name it.

74
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,635
You better get off me.

75
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,570
I don't know.

76
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:13,574
You're very comfortable.

77
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,810
If you don't get off
me, I'm going to fart.

78
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,512
And it is not going to be quiet.

79
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:22,149
And it is not
going to be pretty.

80
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,050
Go ahead.

81
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,618
Serenade me.

82
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:25,953
It's my last night
as a free man.

83
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:38,232
It's kind of late.

84
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,900
Can I stay here too?

85
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,336
Uh, don't you want
to be with Belinda?

86
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,303
Not for the wedding.

87
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:44,204
Bad luck.

88
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:45,105
Remember?

89
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:46,140
What, what about your tux?

90
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,074
Ted has it.

91
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,242
He can pick me up
in the morning.

92
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,643
Yeah, if he can get
here without snorting

93
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:54,348
all the carpet freshener
out of the hallway rugs.

94
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,252
Why didn't you let the
stripper give you a lap dance?

95
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,521
Uh, more beer?

96
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,657
I stopped drinking
beer two hours ago.

97
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:04,591
Tequila shots.

98
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,126
Oh, hell no.

99
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,995
You can't be drinking
beer like a pussy

100
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,530
when I'm slugging tequila.

101
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,932
And how exactly does
a pussy drink beer?

102
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,770
Glug, glug, glug, slug-

103
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,238
And you want tequila.

104
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:19,139
Pour asshole.

105
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:32,286
And?

106
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,187
YOu?

107
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,699
Toast rne.

108
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,401
Demanding little shit.

109
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,403
Toast me or I'll tell
your mother the stripper

110
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,438
made you bowling ball her
in front of everybody.

111
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:52,339
Bowling ball?

112
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,143
OK.

113
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,411
OK.

114
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,680
To Cooper.

115
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:04,117
May your hair never
fall, your dick

116
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:11,058
always rise, and your kids never
call your brother-in-law daddy.

117
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,893
[laughing]

118
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,095
But seriously, Coop.

119
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,598
Be happy-

120
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,133
And to you, Lewis.

121
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,002
May you get everything
that you want.

122
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,573
Another.

123
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:27,474
Another.

124
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,081
Cooper, no.

125
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,517
My blood is 90% tequila already.

126
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,720
It's my bachelor party, Lewis.

127
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,288
OK, fine.

128
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:42,856
But let's just sip these, OK.

129
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,826
I need to slow down.

130
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:46,727
OK.

131
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:55,402
Seriously, I'm sorry about
the whole best man thing.

132
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,977
I call three questions.

133
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:04,945
What's that?

134
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,114
We ask each other
three questions.

135
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,049
No subject is off limits.

136
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:09,983
Lyin is not-—

137
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:10,918
Lyin?

138
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:15,088
Lying is not allowed.

139
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:15,989
What?

140
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,391
What are you doing?

141
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:21,161
Well, obviously, I've wandered
into a pre-teen slumber party.

142
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,196
You're certainly
dressed for it.

143
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,599
There is one thing I been
wanting to ask you since you

144
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,801
came into town a week ago.

145
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:28,702
What?

146
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,808
OK.

147
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,476
Question one.

148
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,181
What is the wildest thing that
you have ever done sexually?

149
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,749
Are We really going there?

150
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,585
I'm about to
commit myself to one

151
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,954
woman for the rest of my life.

152
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,923
I need here some hot, sexy
shit before I tie a noose

153
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,726
around my dick and hang myself.

154
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,628
You first.

155
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,229
That's against the rules but--

156
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,137
Too many to think of just one?

157
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,141
I got it.

158
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,876
Do you remember in
high school that day

159
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,878
in January when
we got snowed in?

160
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:12,913
Yeah, yeah.

161
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,915
We all had to sleep
in the gymnasium.

162
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,450
Yeah, we slept on
the Wrestling mats.

163
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:17,351
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,352
Right, right.

165
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,087
Remember how they
had everybody just

166
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,089
mixed up, girls with the boys?

167
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,858
Everyone was just
scattered around.

168
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,093
Yeah.

169
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,796
OK, so I wake up in
the middle of the night,

170
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,334
and Michelle Berenger is rubbing
my dick through my jeans.

171
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:35,302
What?

172
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,970
I look around.

173
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:40,040
Everybody's asleep,
even all the teachers.

174
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:44,911
So I pull the old redwood
out, and she goes down on me.

175
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,813
Timber!

176
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,215
Holy shit.

177
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:52,486
She was like a anaconda, man,
swallowing a bigger anaconda.

178
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,587
That's ballsy of her.

179
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,921
Yeah.

180
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,357
I swear that her jaw unhinged
right there in the middle

181
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,460
of 200 sleeping students.

182
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:01,862
Did you ever see her again?

183
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,163
No.

184
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,499
I found out later she was my
third cousin or something.

185
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,168
But that was your second
question, by the way.

186
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,536
So answer mine.

187
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:15,575
Um, OK.

188
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,411
Remember Tom and
Linda from college?

189
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,013
Mm hm Yeah, sure.

190
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,314
OK.

191
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,283
One night-- oh my god.

192
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,986
I can't believe I'm
telling you this.

193
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:31,124
One night, uh, I was at
their place for dinner.

194
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,227
And they been
married nine months.

195
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:39,866
And Linda breaks out the tarot
cards to read my fortune.

196
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,835
And she just says all
the usual bullshit.

197
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,739
You know, I'm gonna be
successful, well liked,

198
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,808
et cetera.

199
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,077
Then she says I'm
going to experience

200
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,113
a big change in my life.

201
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:56,750
She asked if she can read my
palm to get a better clue.

202
00:11:56,983 --> 00:12:00,921
So she's tracing with
her fingers my lifeline,

203
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,689
my heart line.

204
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,058
Yeah, Whatever.

205
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:14,367
And then, her hand slides
down past my Wrist, up my arm,

206
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,803
until it's sliding
over my shoulder.

207
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,205
What was Tom doing?

208
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,308
Watching with a
big grin on his face.

209
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:25,912
And then, we all just
end up on the floor.

210
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,414
What happened?

211
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,850
Did, did you fuck her?

212
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,152
Uh, yeah.

213
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,987
Did he?

214
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:34,888
We both did.

215
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,660
We both did.

216
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:41,561
Wha--?

217
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:42,462
At the same time?

218
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,535
Details now.

219
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,773
OK, well Tom and
I laid on the floor,

220
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,142
and scooted against each other.

221
00:12:55,375 --> 00:13:00,413
Then, he put his legs
over mine and held

222
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,582
our dicks close together.

223
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:06,787
And she, she sat on us.

224
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,221
Who poked what?

225
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,456
He went for.

226
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:13,059
I went aft, if you'll pardon
the [inaudible] terms.

227
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,262
Fuck me.

228
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,229
Where was I?

229
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,330
I don't know.

230
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:22,435
Getting head in the
middle of a flash mob?

231
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:23,570
Are you bullshitting me?

232
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:24,704
No.

233
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,773
Cause when we lie, the
relationship is over.

234
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,608
It's all true.

235
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:31,044
Damn.

236
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,312
That is a whale of a tale.

237
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,149
Shots.

238
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,050
Shots.

239
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:42,789
Another story.

240
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,392
Something Weirder, wilder.

241
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,696
Uh, uh, you first.

242
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,265
In the form of a
question, please.

243
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,535
What's something else you've
clone that's sexually crazy?

244
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,777
Come on.

245
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,912
The dog licked my balls once.
Does that count?

246
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:06,813
Ew!

247
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,148
No!

248
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,016
Why did you let the
dog lick your balls?

249
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,651
Well, l didn't let him.

250
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:14,187
He caught me by surprise.

251
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,724
What were you doing so
the dog could-- never mind.

252
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:18,625
Come on.

253
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,526
Something else.

254
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,901
I got nothing.

255
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:28,969
Bullshit.

256
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,837
How do you top a
blowjob in the middle

257
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,906
of a 200 person sleepover?

258
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:36,643
Everything else
pales by comparison.

259
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:40,580
What about something
with your fiance?

260
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,416
Strictly coloring
inside the lines there.

261
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,384
My turn.

262
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:45,685
Question two.

263
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,589
What have you done sexually
that would shock me?

264
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,997
I better not.

265
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:57,964
What?
No fair.

266
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:58,865
Why?

267
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:06,539
I don't want you
to think badly of me.

268
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,909
I think you're an
asshole already so spill.

269
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,149
[Sigh]

270
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,652
We're just telling stories here.

271
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,354
I promise, there's nothing you
could say that will make me

272
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,024
feel any differently about you.

273
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,962
All right.

274
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:33,400
The Tom and Linda story, I
didn't tell you everything.

275
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,301
OK.

276
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,273
So Linda's kissing me.

277
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,343
Tom's getting undressed.

278
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:47,147
And then, she kissed him.

279
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:54,154
And then, he, he kissed me.

280
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,790
Tom kissed you?

281
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,259
Yes.

282
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:04,531
Then, we all just started
kissing, and making out,

283
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,033
and fell to the floor.

284
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:16,776
And then, well, then
I, I sucked his dick.

285
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,052
What was it like?

286
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,090
What?

287
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,591
Question three.

288
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,727
What was it like sucking a dick?

289
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,033
It was good.

290
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,668
Fun.

291
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,837
Easy.

292
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,138
Pussy on a stick.

293
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:58,218
Look, I'm bisexual.

294
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,888
I've known it for a long time.

295
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,757
I'm sorry I never told you.

296
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:09,929
I just, I didn't know how.

297
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,065
I have to piss.

298
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,050
Fucking tequila.

299
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:45,865
Put some porn on.

300
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,205
[moaning]

301
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:58,545
Seen it.

302
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,416
Seen it.

303
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,522
Are you kidding me with this?

304
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,457
Yes.

305
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,891
Ooh, yeah.

306
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:12,892
Get that pussy wet, yeah.

307
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:13,893
Seen it.

308
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:17,230
- (ON TV) Oh.
- Put something else on.

309
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,168
This is all the
straight porn I have.

310
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,736
Bullshit.

311
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,904
It is.

312
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:28,575
Everything else is
from my personal stash.

313
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:29,476
I don't care.

314
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,643
Just put something in.

315
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,668
Now if this is too much
for you, just say so.

316
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:56,836
Just push play, grandma.

317
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,737
Let's go.

318
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,844
(QN TV) Oh, yeah.

319
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:08,815
[moaning] Oh_

320
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,317
Oh, fuck yeah.

321
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,286
Oh.

322
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,788
Oh.

323
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,790
Oh, yeah.

324
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:22,762
[m0afiing] Oh, yeah.

325
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:26,966
I didn't know
guys could do that.

326
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,203
(ow TV) Uh huh.

327
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,373
Gotta piss again.

328
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,341
[moaning sex sounds]

329
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:49,322
(QN TV) Fuck.

330
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:50,323
Oh, yeah.

331
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,808
Tough to piss when
you got a hard on.

332
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,251
That guys dick is huge!

333
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,759
So how big are you?

334
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:06,366
I don't know.

335
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,701
I never sized it.

336
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,703
YOu?

337
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:11,638
Never sized mine either.

338
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:19,145
Too bad I don't
have a tape measurer.

339
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:22,448
You don't have
a tape measurer?

340
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:25,118
Sorry.

341
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:26,552
All the times to
forget my Christian

342
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,087
Siriano portable sewing kit.

343
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:36,562
Well when you see a guy in
the movie who's the same size

344
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,264
as you, point him out.

345
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:42,935
OK.

346
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,314
Him.

347
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:55,682
No way.

348
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:56,849
No fucking way.

349
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:57,750
Yeah.

350
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:58,718
Pretty close.

351
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,153
That is a whale of a tale.

352
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,054
You aren't that big.

353
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:01,954
No way.

354
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:05,925
Maybe I should show you.

355
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,244
I think you're right.

356
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:40,793
I've never touched
another guy's dick before.

357
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:41,694
It's OK.

358
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:45,098
You can if you want to.

359
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,165
Do you want to?

360
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:49,669
Yeah.

361
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,900
I've never sucked a cock before.

362
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:22,902
You can if you want to.

363
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,237
Do you want to?

364
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:27,407
Yeah.

365
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,219
No teeth.

366
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:45,358
What?

367
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,126
You're not using any teeth.

368
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,295
- Do you want me to?
- No.

369
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,396
No.

370
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,001
I just-- you're
really good at this.

371
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:56,602
Sure you never done this before?

372
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:57,503
L\/lrn mm.

373
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,914
Take your pants off.

374
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:08,981
I've had too much to drink.

375
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:11,217
I don't even know if
I can get hard again.

376
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,118
Let me worry about that.

377
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,928
Is it OK?

378
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:56,963
Yeah.

379
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,632
That was close.

380
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:00,766
Lewis one.

381
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,734
Whiskey dick, zero.

382
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:09,876
What's the matter?

383
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,811
Let me kiss you.

384
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:15,248
I don't want to do that.

385
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:18,117
You just had my
dick in your mouth.

386
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,786
You won't let me kiss you?

387
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,892
It's just different.

388
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:26,926
How?

389
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,831
Kissing is more intimate.

390
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:34,233
I want to save that.

391
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:35,134
OK.

392
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:42,542
I want to do you again.

393
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:43,442
Sure.

394
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:50,850
[moaning]

395
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,194
What time is it?

396
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:06,365
6:25.

397
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:10,770
I should get up.

398
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,372
I gotta shower.

399
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:16,943
Yeah, cause the Wedding's
in about five hours.

400
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:55,381
I knew the affair was
doomed from the beginning.

401
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:58,985
Jeff had a beautiful wife,
two handsome children, and

402
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,787
a thriving peanut plantation.

403
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:04,123
He would never
give him up for me.

404
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:07,259
And truly, he would
be a fool to do so.

405
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:14,834
But he had planted a seed in me.

406
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:18,237
A seed that burned deep within.

407
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,206
I must have him.

408
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,173
Whatever it takes.

409
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:36,689
Gideon.

410
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:46,198
That was fast.

411
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:47,099
More of a rinse.

412
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,740
OK, I know this is stupid.

413
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:57,243
But I have to ask.

414
00:27:57,476 --> 00:28:00,379
Did we do anything unsafe?

415
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:02,581
We gave Ted the
key to the minibar.

416
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:03,916
I'm serious.

417
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,718
Don't worry.
You're fine.

418
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,688
It was just intro
to homo sex 'I01.

419
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,022
Did I pass?

420
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:11,657
The oral exam, yes.

421
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:12,558
OK.

422
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:13,759
Good.

423
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,494
Just wait till we get
to the advanced classes.

424
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:21,067
Lewis, this can
never happen again.

425
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,538
Do you want to pray?

426
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:26,639
What?

427
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,607
Does this mean you
don't want the 5O bucks?

428
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,109
No.

429
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:31,310
I'm sorry.

430
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,479
I'm just not used to so
much drama from my tricks.

431
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,414
You're such a dick.

432
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:38,317
The word you're looking
for is John, not dick.

433
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,953
Now go put something pretty on,
and let's get some breakfast.

434
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:44,790
Lewis, can you set your phaser
to serious for one minute?

435
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:47,293
OK, let's hear it.

436
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:50,162
Here what?

437
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:51,397
L'm not gay.

438
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,898
I like women.

439
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:55,167
I was just, dot, dot, dot.

440
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,202
Choose from the following.

441
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:57,770
A, curious.

442
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:58,738
B, drunk.

443
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,206
C, horny.

444
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:04,677
Followed up by and there was a
willing mouth in the room so.

445
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,979
Lewis, I liked it.

446
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:08,114
OK?

447
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,282
I wouldn't have
done it otherwise.

448
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:11,817
But I'm getting married today.

449
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:16,255
Oh, I should've
made that choice D.

450
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:20,593
Look, I'm not gonna
freak out or run away.

451
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,962
And I'm not gonna say that
we can't be buddies anymore.

452
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,564
You're my best friend.

453
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:29,435
And if anything, this just
made me feel closer to you.

454
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,537
Except for the kissing.

455
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,807
Well I got to save
something for my wife.

456
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,908
OK.

457
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,009
She can have your feet.

458
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:38,744
I don't like feet.

459
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,646
Feet are suspicious.

460
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,882
They never look you in the eye.

461
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,817
Lewis, it was fun.

462
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,886
And I'm glad that
it was with you.

463
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,721
But once is enough.

464
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,723
You can't stop at just one.

465
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,325
Think of me as your personal
bag of potato chips.

466
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,195
You both make
my fingers greasy.

467
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:57,196
Good one, straight boy.

468
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:04,170
Hey, Ted?

469
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:05,337
Yeah, it's Cooper.

470
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:06,338
I need you to come pick me up.

471
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,941
I'm still at the hotel.

472
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,777
Yeah, I got drunk
and passed out.

473
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,712
All right.

474
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:14,947
OK.

475
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,882
All right, I'll meet you
out front in a few minutes.

476
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:17,783
Bye.

477
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:27,026
<i>L</i> 90': to go.

478
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,465
Fflends?

479
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:34,600
Of course.

480
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:35,601
With benefits?

481
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,136
Ass.

482
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,471
OK, kiss me goodbye.

483
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,173
How about a hug?

484
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:42,241
I'll take it.

485
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,449
See you later?

486
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,352
Yes, you will.

487
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:54,820
Your nose smells like tuna.

488
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:01,293
Love you, Lewis.

489
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,194
Love you, Coop.

[music playing]

491
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:53,605
What are you doing?

492
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,607
Testing my camera skills.

493
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,376
Are we changing professions?

494
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,511
No, I thought I'd make a
sexy video with the wife.

495
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:01,447
I just wanted to
test it out first.

496
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,481
I'll erase it.

497
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:04,116
That's an expensive sex toy.

498
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,118
I got it for the baby.

499
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:07,219
The baby needs a sex toy?

500
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:08,120
The birth.

501
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:10,055
I'm recording the birth.

502
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:12,124
That's your idea
of a sexy video?

503
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:14,760
Or is it just the third
act of a story arc?

504
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,595
Dick.

505
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,998
The wife liked your
latest book, by the way.

506
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,433
They all say that.

507
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:22,501
When's it due?

508
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:24,169
In a couple of weeks.

509
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:25,471
Congratulations!

510
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:26,705
Thanks.

511
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:27,740
Let's drink a toast.

512
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:28,640
Shots.

513
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,311
You go ahead without me.

514
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:33,212
What?

515
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,948
We have to drink a toast.

516
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,049
Come on.

517
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,450
[inaudible].

518
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:41,286
Uh, yeah.

519
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,354
Tell me When.

520
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:43,856
That's, that's great.

521
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,357
Yeah, too much.

522
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:46,258
That's the point.

523
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:49,328
Here.

524
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:54,533
To my son.

525
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,402
You know the sex?

526
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:57,536
Yeah, for awhile now.

527
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,537
You didn't say anything.

528
00:33:58,771 --> 00:33:59,638
Are you excited?

529
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,041
Not yet, but
I'm getting there.

530
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:02,941
Get off.

531
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:05,277
I meant about the baby.

532
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:06,645
Being a father.

533
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,014
Having a son.

534

[Sigh]

could shit a crowbar.

H 9Y-

537
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,129
All new fathers get nervous.

538
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,002
What if I sit on him?

539
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,870
[chuckle]

540
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:33,272
Why would you sit on him?

541
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,040
Well not intentionally.

542
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,345
I want to be a good dad, Lewis.

543
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,547
The best.

544
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,816
I have to be.

545
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:48,320
Cooper, you're a
sweet, loving man.

546
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,089
You're gonna be a great dad.

547
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:50,989
You think so?

548
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:56,428
Of course.

549
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:58,063
I just don't want to
fuck him up in the head.

550
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59,264
Then, Wait till
he's 3O before you

551
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:00,699
tell him daddy's a cock sucker.

552
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:10,142
I don't know what's bouncing
around in that spinning raffle

553
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,210
basket of the head of yours.

554
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,046
Do you remember
when my dad left?

555
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,248
Yeah, soon after
we became friends.

556
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,788
He never said goodbye.

557
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,323
He just left.

558
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,659
I thought it was me, that I did
something wrong, even today.

559
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,699
It's like he pushed a dirty
thumbprint into my brain

560
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:34,600
that won't go away.

561
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:40,305
You're gonna be an
awesome dad, Coop.

562
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:41,206
The best.

563
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,110
Thanks, Lewis.

564
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,246
You always say the
intelligent thing.

565
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,781
Yes, I know.

566
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:53,318
I had a very handsome
younger brother.

567
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:57,456
When we were kids, people
would look at him and say,

568
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,825
you are so cute.

569
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:02,995
And then, they'd look
at me and say, uh,

570
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,063
you must be the smart one.

571
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,866
Hey, we can't all be a
[inaudible] Somebody's gotta

572
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,302
be Kate Jackson.

573
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:11,203
Camera.

574
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,014
Take your shirt off.

575
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:22,915
You really are a perv.

576
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:23,815
You know that?

577
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:25,450
You must like it.

578
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:29,121
Four years later, and you
haven't skipped an anniversary.

579
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,023
Pants.

580
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,592
Fourth anniversary.

581
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,827
That's fruit, isn't it?

582
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:39,865
I'd answer that, but I
think you'd be insulted.

583
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:40,766
Get in bed.

584
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:47,773
Hey, I want another drink.

585
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,575
YOu?

586
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:50,642
I'm good.

587
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:51,577
Here.
Tékethat

588
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,477
OK.

589
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:03,255
Coop, what do you
tell your wife?

590
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:04,323
What do you mean?

591
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,592
Well every year for
the past four years,

592
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,527
We've met in this
same hotel room.

593
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,063
It's the day before
your anniversary.

594
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,265
What does she think?

595
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,601
I tell her one of my buddies
is sick and in the hospital.

596
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:16,969
I have to go see him.

597
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:20,505
So far, four of my closest
imaginary friends have died.

598
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,709
Belinda doesn't strike
me as being stupid.

599
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,077
She's not.

600
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:29,615
She's just trusting.

601
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:31,216
You sure you don't
want another drink?

602
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:38,156
Why do you drink
so much before?

603
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,625
Before?

604
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:42,194
Before.

605
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,463
It relaxes me.

606
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:45,530
Why do you need to be relaxed?

607
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,501
Give.

608
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:57,976
Lie back.

609
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,049
Play with yourself.

610
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:06,718
Do you have a preference
as to which hand?

611
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:07,986
No more talking.

612
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,454
Do it.

613
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:11,323
What are you gonna
do with this tape?

614
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:12,658
We're gonna watch it.

615
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:13,692
Then what?

616
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,394
Then, we're gonna fuck.

617
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,262
Thought you didn't fuck.

618
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:18,764
I'm gonna fuck you.

619
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,866
You're not gonna fuck me.

620
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:25,304
And here, I didn't
get you anything.

621
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:27,706
Talk to me.

622
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,141
What do you want me to say?

623
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:30,042
Sexy things.

624
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:34,346
Just don't make
me call you big Jar

625
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,114
Jar Rat Nuts like last time.

626
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:38,050
Come on.

627
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:38,950
OK.

628
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:48,026
Do you like what you see?

629
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,996
Yeah.

630
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:53,098
Does it turn you on?

631
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:53,999
Fuck yeah.

632
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:01,239
Don't you wanna pan down?

633
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:02,140
No.

634
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:03,709
A dick is a dick.

635
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,510
Your face is sexy.

636
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:06,745
Show me how much I turn you on.

637
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,124
Cooper.

638
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:20,625
Yeah.

639
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,127
Cooper.

640
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:25,097
Yeah.

641
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:25,997
Cooper.

642
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:27,165
Come close?

643
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,333
Yes.
Yeah, l'm--

644
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:29,234
[phone ringing]

645
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:30,135
Shit.

646
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:33,205
Don't cum yet.

647
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:34,172
[phone ringing]

648
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:37,476
Who is it?

649
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:38,377
The Wife.

650
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,746
[phone ringing]

651
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:41,947
Aren't you gonna get it?

652
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:47,085
No.

653
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:49,921
Now where were We?

654
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,590
No, I'm not in the mood.

655
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:53,759
Oh, come on.

656
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:54,659
No, sorry.

657
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:09,674
Don't pout.

658
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,077
Who's pouting?

659
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,679
Well if I had
to guess, I'd say

660
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:18,984
it's the guy sitting in the
chair with the frowny face.

661
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:22,020
You're mistaken.

662
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,723
I don't think so.

663
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:25,624
Come here.

664
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,894
Come here.

665
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:41,807
I'm sorry.

666
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,281
I love our annual get-togethers.

667
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:52,651
I really do.

668
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:54,553
But you can't expect
me to throw wood

669
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,922
when I know you're
pregnant Wife is calling

670
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,123
wondering where you are.

671
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:00,091
She's not here, Lewis.

672
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:02,027
You are and I am.

673
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,195
Us.

674
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:05,397
One day a year.

675
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,299
Let's just hit the pause
button on our lives.

676
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:11,002
Just turn the lights off
on the world for one day.

677
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:13,939
We have one day to grind,
and sweat, and moan,

678
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:17,008
and not care about anything.

679
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:18,009
But--

680
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,644
It gets crazy at
the store, Lewis.

681
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,446
I have to control the stock.

682
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,547
Control the staff.

683
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,816
Control the deliveries.

684
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,618
I'll have the father
in law hovering over me

685
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:29,221
scowling at everything I do.

686
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:30,889
You write romance novels.

687
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,224
You create characters.

688
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,459
You pick the words
that they say.

689
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:35,961
Don't you want to
take one day a year

690
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:41,833
and just say, fuck it, I want
to lie in bed and screw all day?

691
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:43,902
I'm not in a relationship.

692
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:45,036
I don't have to be the grownup.

693
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,005
Well I don't want to
be the grown up either.

694
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,807
And soon, that's
all I'm gonna be.

695
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:01,486
Your turn.

696
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,358
- What do you want me to do?
- Get on your knees.

697
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,966
Good.
I like you like that.

698
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,835
What do you want me to do?

699
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:17,736
Call me sir.

700
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,738
Ha!

701
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:22,741
Hey, you said you don't
want to be the grown-up?

702
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:24,075
Do it.

703
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:27,178
Call me sir, or I'll start
describing Bristol Palin naked.

704
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:31,283
Fucking-- OK.

705
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:35,554
What do you want me to do, sir?

706
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:51,503
May I touch myself, sir?

707
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,404
Yes.

708
00:43:03,048 --> 00:43:05,383
Wait, Coop.

709
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:07,886
Sure you want me to
be feeling like this?

710
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:16,861
[doorbell]

711
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:42,053
Who is it?

712
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,488
Housekeeping.

713
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:45,290
I'm sorry for the
interruption, sir.

714
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:47,158
I started my shift late.

715
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:48,693
Oh, uh, that's OK.

716
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:51,296
Um, uh, the room's fine.

717
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:52,764
Uh, I'll be as quick as I can.

718
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:54,065
It'll only take a few minutes.

719
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:55,500
Um, OK.

720
00:43:55,734 --> 00:44:00,038
Uh, just, just please
be as fast as you can.

721
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:01,039
Yes, sir.

722
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:02,701
Would you like me to
make your bed, sir?

723
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,035
No!

724
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:05,670
No, it's, it's OK.

725
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:06,571
Thanks.

726
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:41,406
I'm all done, sir.

727
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,008
Oh, um, great.

728
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,143
Thank you.

729
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:46,544
Have a nice stay with us.

730
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:48,680
If it gets any better, I don't
think I'll be able to stand it.

731
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:52,150
Did we get that?

732
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:01,159
Ha fucking ha.

733
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:02,060
Shut up.

734
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:03,728
You liked it.

735
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:06,731
Sometimes I think
you're certifiably insane.

736
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:10,502
I'm just kicking up my heels.

737
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:12,704
I wish you would.

738
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,473
Ha fucking ha to you.

739
00:46:15,707 --> 00:46:17,041
I got something for you.

740
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,810
Oh you do, do you?

741
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:23,281
I know it's not your birthday,
but I got you a present.

742
00:46:23,515 --> 00:46:25,216
Lucky me.

743
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,684
Why don't you try it on?

744
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,052
See if it fits.

745
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,387
Oh, I think it'll fit.

746
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:30,255
You know my size.

747
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:37,896
No undies.

748
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,964
Somebody's being adventurous.

749
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:42,133
Shut up and suck me.

750
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:43,134
Yes, daddy.

751
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:47,172
Lewis, just, just
don't say that.

752
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:48,773
No, I'm sorry.

753
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:49,774
It's my bad.

754
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:05,456
[phone ringing]

755
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,357
Damn it!

756
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:09,661
Oh for fucks sake.

757
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:11,129
[phone ringing]

758
00:47:13,765 --> 00:47:15,266
Is it you're wife again?

759
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,334
It doesn't matter.

760
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:22,006
Now where you going?

761
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,309
Shrivel city.

762
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:26,544
Is that anywhere
near Bonerville?

763
00:47:26,778 --> 00:47:27,612
Not today it isn't.

764
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:38,723
I went commando for this?

765
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:47,899
What do you want me to do?

766
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:51,569
You know this is a situation
we have to face sometimes.

767
00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:55,974
I didn't get upset last year
when your mom kept calling.

768
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,108
She was having a heart attack.

769
00:47:57,342 --> 00:47:58,576
No, she wasn't.

770
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,345
She over-blended
her Activia smoothie

771
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:02,547
and was having gas cramps.

772
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,816
She was curled up on
the floor of her shower

773
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,251
in the fetal position.

774
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:08,887
Calling your name and
farting into her Life Alert.

775
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,257
Seriously, who drinks a
smoothie in the shower?

776
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,626
The point is she
thought she was dying.

777
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:16,027
And so did you?

778
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:20,265
If your ass had teeth, you
would've bitten my dick off.

779
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:22,567
So why didn't you g0?

780
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,468
Shots.

781
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:32,277
I stashed this
away just in case.

782
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,177
Oh!

783
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,114
The good stuff.

784
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:37,849
Oh, forget those.

785
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:45,723
You're a regular boy scout.

786
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:46,824
I remember when
I practically had

787
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:49,193
to force you to drink with me.

788
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,495
I know you too well.

789
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:51,396
Yeah?

790
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:55,066
H 9Y-

791
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,602
Have you ever done
a kissing shot?

792
00:48:57,835 --> 00:48:58,603
No.

793
00:48:58,836 --> 00:48:59,904
What is it?

794
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:03,007
I pour a shot into my
mouth, push it into yours,

795
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:05,410
so we share it.

796
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:06,744
Gross.

797
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:07,879
Oh, come on.

798
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,714
Try it!

799
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:11,082
Or does your sense
of adventure just

800
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:13,318
stop at not wearing underwear?

801
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:15,053
That's kissing.

802
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:18,056
Only better with liquor.

803
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,391
Lewis, how many times
do I have to say it?

804
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,827
No kissing, even with booze.

805
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:23,728
Listen.

806
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:26,064
You won't let me fuck you.

807
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,933
I think the least I
deserve is a kiss.

808
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:31,536
One lousy kiss.

809
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:36,874
Not an insurmountable request
for three years of penetration.

810
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:38,443
Fuck, OK.

811
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:39,510
Really?

812
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:41,079
With booze.

813
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,948
Now this is an
anniversary present.

814
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:46,651
Of course, it's not fruit.

815
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:47,719
Shut up and pour.

816
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:55,526
Belly up to the bar.

817
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:08,740
Well, make your move, cowpoke.

818
00:50:47,178 --> 00:50:48,546
Yeah.

819
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,014
I know.

820
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:54,218
That was some strong stuff.

821
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:57,622
Want another one?

822
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:58,623
No.

823
00:50:58,856 --> 00:50:59,524
No.

824
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:10,868
Can you admit you
felt something just now?

825
00:51:11,102 --> 00:51:13,037
Like what?

826
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:14,005
I don't know.

827
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,540
A Spark!

828
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:16,841
I don't like kissing, Lewis.

829
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:18,309
I told you that.

830
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:19,277
Yeah but--

831
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:22,280
[vibrating phone sound]

832
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:24,282
I don't even kiss the Wife.

833
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,209
Do you remember what
I said the first time

834
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,411
you wanted to kiss me?

835
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:54,312
Yeah.

836
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:58,249
You said it was too intimate.

837
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:00,318
You wanted to save it.

838
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:04,722
You never asked me
who I was saving it for.

839
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:07,358
I had three better
questions that year.

840
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:11,195
But I assumed you were
saving it for your Wife.

841
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:12,964
So did I.

842
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:18,936
But even when We were dating,
that peck at the wedding,

843
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,305
I knew that it wasn't for her.

844
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:23,274
What wasn't for her?

845
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:24,575
The intimacy.

846
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,411
The person I could
share my soul with.

847
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,814
Be one with.

848
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:30,948
I mean, don't get
me wrong, buddy.

849
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:31,849
I love her.

850
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:33,217
I, I really do.

851
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:35,520
I mean, she's gonna be
the mother of my kid.

852
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:38,723
But she's not my other half.

853
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,158
She doesn't complete me.

854
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:41,726
Complete you?

855
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:44,896
Has the Lifetime channel gone
Clockwork Orange on your ass?

856
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:46,030
No.

857
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:49,200
The wife, she has these
romantic audio books.

858
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:51,435
She listens to them
before we go to sleep.

859
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,172
One of yours once.

860
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:56,507
Have you ever fucked
to a Harlequin romance?

861
00:52:56,741 --> 00:53:00,778
I fucked on a
Harlequin romance.

862
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:03,614
I got tapped at the library.

863
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:07,285
So you're afraid of intimacy?

864
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:12,256
Of finding intimacy,
especially now.

865
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:17,528
I'm married, Lewis,
with a kid on the way.

866
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:19,263
What happens if
I find the person

867
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:22,867
that I'm supposed to be with?

868
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,502
Think about it.

869
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:26,604
And you think it might be me?

870
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:30,441
Wait.

871
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:31,842
Are you afraid it might be me?

872
00:53:43,154 --> 00:53:44,989
You sure do make a
lot of dramatic exits

873
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:47,725
for a straight guy.

874
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:48,859
I call three questions.

875
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:49,760
Shit.

876
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:51,362
Not now, Lewis.

877
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:52,263
Fuck.

878
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:54,432
Rules of three questions.

879
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:57,501
The game can be initiated
once a year, at any time,

880
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:58,903
by either player.

881
00:53:59,136 --> 00:53:59,971
No refusals.

882
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:01,906
No time-outs.

883
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:03,574
- Cmp
- Your game.

884
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:04,942
Your rules.
- OK.

885
00:54:05,176 --> 00:54:06,310
Go.

886
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:10,615
We've been together in the
Leviticus sense four times now.

887
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:11,816
Question one.

888
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:12,984
Shoot.

889
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:16,821
Do you consider
yourself gay or bi?

890
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:17,722
Neither.

891
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:19,090
I'm straight.

892
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:21,192
But you can fit more of
my cock down your throat

893
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:22,393
than a porn star.

894
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:24,362
You jackhammer my
butt like it's payday

895
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,130
at the construction site.

896
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:27,632
Question two.

897
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:30,201
How can you consider
yourself straight?

898
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:31,302
Question one.

899
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:33,070
How can you consider
yourself bi?

900
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:34,438
What are you talking about?

901
00:54:34,672 --> 00:54:37,074
After my bachelor party, you
said that you were bisexual.

902
00:54:37,308 --> 00:54:39,176
But since then, every
relationship you've told

903
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:41,012
me about has been with dudes.

904
00:54:41,245 --> 00:54:42,179
What gives?

905
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:45,716
It's an evolution from
straight, to curious,

906
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,852
to bisexual, to gay.

907
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:49,954
I call it the
Elton John Parkway.

908
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:53,524
I just got off at the
Ricky Martin exit.

909
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:54,959
So you're 93V-

910
00:54:55,192 --> 00:54:56,093
Yeah.

911
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:57,395
And you're straight.

912
00:54:57,628 --> 00:55:00,097
Yeah But I can admit I'm gay.

913
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:01,065
Why can't you be gay?
Why-

914
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:02,199
I like women, Lewis.

915
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:03,367
I always have.

916
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:06,337
I just like to suck
dick once in awhile.

917
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,040
Have you had sex with
any men other than me?

918
00:55:09,273 --> 00:55:10,207
No.

919
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:11,676
Why do you think I meet
you here every year?

920
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:16,113
To get all those urges
out of my system.

921
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:17,815
I'm a gay pressure valve.

922
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:19,083
No.

923
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:21,018
You're my best friend.

924
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:22,219
I couldn't do it
with anybody else.

925
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,325
You know what I think?

926
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:33,230
I think you're bisexual
with a preference for women.

927
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:35,700
Can we agree on that?

928
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:37,735
50/50, so to speak.

929
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:40,538
Well this is
definitely a mood killer.

930
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:44,175
I'm just trying to
figure out how you

931
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:45,743
justify what it is We do here.

932
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:47,211
Why do we need to justify it?

933
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:49,580
Let's just have some fun and
leave all that heavy shit

934
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:51,048
outside in the real world.

935
00:55:51,282 --> 00:55:55,853
Uh, I believe you're the one
dragging the real world in here

936
00:55:56,087 --> 00:55:58,956
with this I won't kiss mantra.

937
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:04,061
If you truly believe that this
hotel suite was fantasy land,

938
00:56:04,295 --> 00:56:06,697
a kiss wouldn't mean anything.

939
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:10,034
Hell, throwing your legs
up wouldn't mean anything.

940
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:12,002
Being bi--
- Straight.

941
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:12,970
--Wouldn't mean anything.

942
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:14,939
Can we just drop it?

943
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:17,842
All I want is a little
oral sex, mano a mano.

944
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:21,946
Not for me to be staring
at ink blots while I do it.

945
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:26,150
I thought I was the comic
and you were the straight man.

946
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,552
Nest, you'll say
I have daddy issues.

947
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:30,821
Well-- sorry.

948
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:36,594
You got your Freud
in my Dr. Ruth.

949
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:38,462
You got your Dr.
Ruth in my Freud.

950
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:45,936
Shots?

951
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:46,837
No.

952
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:58,015
You got two more
questions to ask me.

953
00:56:58,249 --> 00:56:59,517
I don't feel like playing.

954
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,953
Come on.

955
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:05,923
What's your favorite color?

956
00:57:06,157 --> 00:57:08,159
How about some music?

957
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:09,059
Whatever.

958
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:11,028
[music playing]

959
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:16,200
Hey, do you recognize this?

960
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:21,405
It's the song the Wife and I
danced to at the reception.

961
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:26,444
Come on, Lewis.

962
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:27,344
It's four years ago.

963
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:29,346
[music playing]

964
00:57:53,337 --> 00:57:55,306
This is nice.

965
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:57,107
Yes, it is.

966
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:58,609
[music playing]

967
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:06,684
I would have bet
you didn't have

968
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:09,553
a romantic bone in your body.

969
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:11,856
You can put this
in one of your books.

970
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:13,224
You have my permission.

971
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:14,758
Thank you.

972
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:19,563
All I want is
10% of the gross.

973
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:24,268
This scene is too
sappy for a book.

974
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:29,106
It's better suited for a
drippy, melodramatic play or

975
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,176
some dopey, independent film.

976
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:34,478
You're selling us short.

977
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:37,147
No, I'm not.

978
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:38,415
You're selling somebody short.

979
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,757
So how about them Cubs.

980
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:47,658
Shut it.

981
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:53,931
You're not a bad dancer.

982
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:55,900
Where'd you learn that?

983
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:57,134
When you have
two older sisters

984
00:58:57,368 --> 00:59:01,739
that look like your
father, you learn to dance.

985
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:02,640
Dip?

986
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:11,148
Nicely done.

987
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:14,652
And you?

988
00:59:18,322 --> 00:59:20,424
My grandma, Rose.

989
00:59:20,658 --> 00:59:22,726
Did I ever meet her?

990
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,428
No.

991
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:27,031
She lived alone in a
big house in Salem.

992
00:59:31,802 --> 00:59:38,208
On the second floor, at the end
of the hall was a locked door.

993
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:40,544
And whenever I'd ask
her what was inside,

994
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:42,746
she'd put finger to her lips.

995
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,049
Ssh.

996
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:48,352
And one day when
we were alone, she

997
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:53,190
showed me this old fashioned key
hanging from a thin blue ribbon

998
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:58,963
around her neck and said,
Lewis, would you like to see

999
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:01,565
what's in the secret room?

1000
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:06,570
I almost peed myself waiting
for her to unlock that door.

1001
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:07,638
So?

1002
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:10,374
What was inside?

1003
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:12,443
Another bedroom.

1004
01:00:12,676 --> 01:00:13,677
That's it?

1005
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:14,578
No.

1006
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:26,824
This one was really fancy
with a big canopy bed,

1007
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:31,061
frilly curtains on the
Windows, pink wallpaper,

1008
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:34,498
an antique dressing
table, and there

1009
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:38,902
was a huge fireplace
with crying cupids carved

1010
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,105
into the marble mantelpiece.

1011
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:45,309
And along one wall, stacked
from the floor almost

1012
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:48,579
to the ceiling, where hatboxes.

1013
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:53,017
Towers and towers of hat boxes.

1014
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,519
Grandma Rose told
me to look inside.

1015
01:00:55,753 --> 01:01:00,157
So I took one down,
removed the lid,

1016
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:07,164
and inside was a human head.

1017
01:01:07,398 --> 01:01:08,065
What?

1018
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:12,002
OK, you're paying attention.

1019
01:01:12,236 --> 01:01:14,405
Dick.

1020
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:16,974
Inside was a hat, of course.

1021
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:21,645
It was purple felt with
feathers and beads.

1022
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:24,281
It looked brand new.

1023
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:26,250
And with it was
a paperback book.

1024
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:29,186
A romance book.

1025
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,855
It was the same in
every box I opened.

1026
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:33,891
Hats and books.

1027
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:40,531
Grandma Rose told me that after
Grandpa died, every few months,

1028
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:44,868
she'd go into town and
buy a hat and a book.

1029
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:49,373
Then, after dinner, she'd
sit at the dressing table,

1030
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:53,811
put on her makeup, her
best dress, the hat,

1031
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:58,849
and sit in a chair by the
window reading her stories.

1032
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:05,656
Her favorite hat was pale pink
with cream colored pearls.

1033
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:12,463
And her favorite book was called
Tales of True Love and Romance.

1034
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:16,667
Whenever we were alone,
we'd go to the secret room,

1035
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,503
put on our hats, and
dance to the radio.

1036
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:31,348
When she died, I
packed up her things.

1037
01:02:31,582 --> 01:02:36,019
I tore up the house looking
for the key to that room.

1038
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,789
I was afraid it had
been buried with her.

1039
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:43,293
But finally, I found it.

1040
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:46,196
It was the first time I'd
opened the room by myself.

1041
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:51,869
And I was so nervous,
my fingers trembled.

1042
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:55,706
But it looked the
same, exactly the same.

1043
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:00,978
But when I opened
one of the hat boxes,

1044
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:05,215
it was empty, except for
a page torn out of a book.

1045
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:06,550
Her favorite book.

1046
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:14,091
I opened every single box, Coop.

1047
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:18,762
I wanted to find the
pink hat with the pearls.

1048
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:20,864
But they were all empty.

1049
01:03:21,098 --> 01:03:24,234
All empty except for
pages torn from tales

1050
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,736
of true love and romance.

1051
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:35,712
That's when I noticed
in the fireplace,

1052
01:03:35,946 --> 01:03:41,118
underneath the crying cupids,
a scorched set of pearls

1053
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:46,356
and a mound of ashes.

1054
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,626
She'd burned her hats.

1055
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,061
All of them.

1056
01:03:57,601 --> 01:04:00,504
On the mirror of her
dresser, she taped a picture

1057
01:04:00,737 --> 01:04:03,440
of herself holding the book.

1058
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:07,377
She looked sad.

1059
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:11,348
On the back she'd
written, you can't find

1060
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:14,251
love in a locked room, Lewis.

1061
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:18,956
You can read about life,
or you can live it.

1062
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:20,591
Be happy-

1063
01:04:20,824 --> 01:04:23,560
Grandma Rose.

1064
01:04:23,794 --> 01:04:25,596
Or you can write about it.

1065
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,238
Come on, Lewis.

1066
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:35,239
Let's live.

1067
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:11,141
[whispering] Coop, are you?

1068
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:12,142
[whispering] Yeah, yeah.

1069
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:13,644
Just, just do it.

1070
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:38,602
[whispering] OK.

1071
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,074
Breathe.

1072
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:45,075
Just breathe.

1073
01:06:03,727 --> 01:06:05,062
How does it feel?

1074
01:06:14,204 --> 01:06:15,138
Sorry.

1075
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:16,039
Sorry.

1076
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:42,065
Lewis.

1077
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:43,700
What?

1078
01:06:43,934 --> 01:06:45,035
Lewis, take it out.

1079
01:06:45,268 --> 01:06:47,070
Take it out.

1080
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:48,038
Oh god.

1081
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:05,655
COOper?

1082
01:07:05,889 --> 01:07:06,823
Hey, COOP?

1083
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:09,359
What?

1084
01:07:09,593 --> 01:07:10,627
It's OK, dude.

1085
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:13,830
Shit happens.

1086
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:14,865
That's not funny.

1087
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:20,404
Look, it's my fault.
I should've prepped you.

1088
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,274
How?

1089
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:36,086
Let me in.

1090
01:07:41,525 --> 01:07:42,392
OK.

1091
01:07:42,626 --> 01:07:47,164
Now tell me when the
water's lukewarm.

1092
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,433
Empty this out, and
refill it with tap Water.

1093
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:50,534
LA tap water?

1094
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:52,569
You'll be fine.

1095
01:07:52,803 --> 01:07:56,306
Now, put the cap back on.

1096
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:57,340
See the nozzle?

1097
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,309
Yeah.

1098
01:07:59,543 --> 01:08:01,244
OK, bend over.

1099
01:08:01,478 --> 01:08:02,345
What?

1100
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:03,346
You heard me.

1101
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,949
Grab your ankles and open wide.

1102
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:07,918
Aah.

1103
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:08,885
Wrong end.

1104
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:14,458
- That's fucking cold.
- Be a man.

1105
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:17,627
Until five minutes
ago, I was a man.

1106
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:19,062
OK, now sit.

1107
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:23,633
Can I have some
privacy, please?

1108
01:08:27,037 --> 01:08:27,938
Rinse and repeat.

1109
01:08:40,984 --> 01:08:42,385
Justin stood above her.

1110
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:47,657
The sun behind his head
making his long, flowing hair

1111
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:52,062
normally the color of wheat glow
with the brilliance of gold.

1112
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:55,265
Lorelei felt her
heart beating rapidly,

1113
01:08:55,499 --> 01:09:01,104
mindful of every single
bead of sweat on her breast.

1114
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:04,908
I give myself to you,
my dear, Justin said.

1115
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:10,280
His voice deep and echoing
as if from inside a barrel.

1116
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:14,618
From this moment on, I am
yours, as you are mine.

1117
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:19,189
Our names branded in fire
on each other's souls.

1118
01:09:19,422 --> 01:09:20,657
[toilet flushing]

1119
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:24,561
Sound of success.

1120
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:39,943
How do you feel?

1121
01:09:40,177 --> 01:09:43,914
Like somebody opened
a water park in my ass.

1122
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:45,515
Do you still want to do it?

1123
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:48,485
I didn't come this
far to give up now.

1124
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:49,452
Wait.

1125
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:50,921
On your back.

1126
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:08,705
I'll show you.

1127
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:22,152
What do you know?

1128
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:23,887
They do look you in the eye.

1129
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,335
Look at me.

1130
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,311
How is it?

1131
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:50,313
Does it feel good?

1132
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:56,786
I'm guessing yes.

1133
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:59,222
You feel so good, Coop.

1134
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:01,224
I never thought
this would happen.

1135
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:03,226
Lewis.

1136
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,161
You're so tight.

1137
01:11:05,395 --> 01:11:07,097
Lewis.

1138
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,399
It's like fucking a keyhole.

1139
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:10,333
Lewis!

1140
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:11,234
What?

1141
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:13,270
Will you shut the hell up?

1142
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:14,271
Oh, yeah.

1143
01:11:14,504 --> 01:11:15,238
Right there.

1144
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,210
[moaning sex sounds]

1145
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:22,712
Oh, shit!

1146
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:24,681
[moaning sex sounds]

1147
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:49,439
Lewis.

1148
01:11:49,673 --> 01:11:50,340
Lewis!

1149
01:11:50,573 --> 01:11:51,241
Get off of me!

1150
01:11:56,579 --> 01:11:57,847
[vomit sounds]

1151
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:01,818
COOper?

1152
01:12:02,052 --> 01:12:03,286
You all right?

1153
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:08,191
Coop?

1154
01:12:08,425 --> 01:12:09,659
[toilet flushing]

1155
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:22,272
Are you OK?

1156
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:23,239
[vibrating phone sound]

1157
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:25,842
Motherfucker!

1158
01:12:26,076 --> 01:12:26,910
Hello?

1159
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:27,811
I wasn't near my phone.

1160
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:28,712
Why?

1161
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,683
When?

1162
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:35,151
Is she OK?

1163
01:12:38,722 --> 01:12:40,990
And what about,
what about the baby?

1164
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:44,894
All right.

1165
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:45,795
Which hospital?

1166
01:12:48,431 --> 01:12:49,532
OK, yeah.
All right.

1167
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:50,433
All right.

1168
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:51,334
I'm on my way.

1169
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:56,306
Is everything OK?

1170
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:57,574
Of course not, Lewis.

1171
01:12:57,807 --> 01:12:59,209
When you hear the word hospital
in a phone conversation,

1172
01:12:59,442 --> 01:13:00,143
it's never OK.

1173
01:13:04,581 --> 01:13:05,315
It was the wife.

1174
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:12,021
The baby came prematurely.

1175
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:13,123
How are they doing?

1176
01:13:16,526 --> 01:13:18,495
It was iffy for a while.

1177
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:21,264
But yeah, they're both fine.

1178
01:13:29,339 --> 01:13:32,108
I never meant for
things to get this far.

1179
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:39,149
Promise me something, Lewis.

1180
01:13:39,382 --> 01:13:41,951
What?

1181
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:44,320
Promise me that We will
never do this again, ever.

1182
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:50,527
We can still meet up
for dinner or drinks.

1183
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,563
Or a good cigar?

1184
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:54,464
Yeah.

1185
01:14:02,972 --> 01:14:04,641
I love you, Lewis.

1186
01:14:04,874 --> 01:14:06,009
Love you, Coop.

1187
01:14:09,379 --> 01:14:10,113
I'm adad!

1188
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:45,949
[music playing]

1189
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:04,761
Fuck.

1190
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:20,977
[phone ringing]

1191
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:22,745
Hello?

1192
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:23,646
Hey, Lewis.

1193
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,448
It's Coop.

1194
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:26,716
Hey, buddy.

1195
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,551
Where are you?

1196
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:32,188
Um, I've been here
for two hours.

1197
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:34,090
How are you, Lewis?

1198
01:16:34,324 --> 01:16:36,092
It's good to hear your voice.

1199
01:16:36,326 --> 01:16:37,560
You too.

1200
01:16:37,794 --> 01:16:39,596
Uh, what number is this?

1201
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:41,431
I didn't recognize it.

1202
01:16:41,664 --> 01:16:42,532
It's the home phone.

1203
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:46,002
I lost my cell.

1204
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:46,903
So where are you?

1205
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:48,137
What's keeping you?

1206
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:50,773
Um, look Lewis, I'm
not coming this year.

1207
01:16:57,347 --> 01:16:58,581
Why not?

1208
01:16:58,815 --> 01:16:59,849
My sister is visiting.

1209
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:02,118
Her family's here.

1210
01:17:02,352 --> 01:17:05,955
[sigh] You can't get away?

1211
01:17:06,189 --> 01:17:09,792
I'm just having
trouble with this.

1212
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:12,428
I feel guilty.

1213
01:17:12,662 --> 01:17:18,034
Then, you should jump
in your car and come over.

1214
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:21,004
I've got the cure for
your guilt right here.

1215
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:22,538
What's that?

1216
01:17:22,772 --> 01:17:26,009
Your favorite
whiskey and cigars.

1217
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:29,479
You're making me-- you're
making this hard for me.

1218
01:17:29,712 --> 01:17:31,214
Literally, I hope.

1219
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:32,548
God, Lewis.

1220
01:17:32,782 --> 01:17:34,917
No, I have to be strong.

1221
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:38,955
The double blended whisky?

1222
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:41,324
Of course.

1223
01:17:41,557 --> 01:17:42,625
I can't, Lewis.

1224
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:43,593
I'm sorry.

1225
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,528
We'll have to
forget it this year.

1226
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:48,765
It's not fair to the
wife, to my family,

1227
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:52,368
and it's not fair to you.

1228
01:17:52,602 --> 01:17:55,605
How is it not fair to me?

1229
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,708
I just don't want to give you
the wrong impression, you know.

1230
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:01,511
Sometimes I feel like you
think this is going somewhere,

1231
01:18:01,744 --> 01:18:02,412
and it can't.

1232
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:11,454
Have I ever said I wanted
anything more than what We do?

1233
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:14,924
Well, no.

1234
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:18,995
Then, Why would
you think I do?

1235
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:20,363
Wait.

1236
01:18:20,596 --> 01:18:21,397
D0 you?

1237
01:18:21,631 --> 01:18:22,298
No, no.

1238
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:24,100
That's not it.

1239
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:27,370
I have to be a grown up now.

1240
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:33,309
You know, a wise man once
said to me let's just take

1241
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:36,345
one day a year and say fuck it.

1242
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:40,883
Let's lie in bed
and screw all day.

1243
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:43,953
Whatever happened to that guy?

1244
01:18:44,187 --> 01:18:45,688
Somehow, he got
stuck with a wife,

1245
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:51,627
a kid, a mortgage, and a badly
timed sense of responsibility.

1246
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:53,162
Tell you what.

1247
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:57,433
Why don't we just go
out to dinner tonight?

1248
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:58,835
Some steaks.

1249
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:00,903
Some wine.

1250
01:19:01,137 --> 01:19:04,474
Let's just hang
out and catch up.

1251
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:06,743
That's harmless, right?

1252
01:19:06,976 --> 01:19:09,045
No sex?

1253
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:11,447
No sex.

1254
01:19:11,681 --> 01:19:14,584
That sounds OK.

1255
01:19:14,817 --> 01:19:19,655
And at dinner, if our legs
happen to touch and I rub

1256
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:22,792
my calf against yours,
there's nothing wrong

1257
01:19:23,025 --> 01:19:23,893
with hand-job under the table.

1258
01:19:24,127 --> 01:19:24,794
Right?

1259
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:27,697
Damn it, Lewis.

1260
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,465
Would you really do that?

1261
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:31,734
Oh, you know I would, buddy.

1262
01:19:31,968 --> 01:19:35,705
I'd make you bite
your lip and sweat.

1263
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:36,672
Oh, fuck.

1264
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:40,042
What are you wearing?

1265
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,648
Jeans and a t-shirt.

1266
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:46,983
Are your jeans
around your ankles?

1267
01:19:51,053 --> 01:19:52,488
They are now.

1268
01:19:52,722 --> 01:19:55,391
Oh, hold on.

1269
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:57,393
What did you do?

1270
01:19:57,627 --> 01:19:59,896
Locked the bedroom door.

1271
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,497
Keep talking.

1272
01:20:01,731 --> 01:20:04,000
What would we be
doing if I was there?

1273
01:20:04,233 --> 01:20:07,036
I'd pull your shirt off.

1274
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:12,175
Then, I'd slowly rub my
hands across your chest,

1275
01:20:12,408 --> 01:20:17,547
pinching your nipples, and
holding you close against me.

1276
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:18,581
Yeah.

1277
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:21,884
Are you hard?

1278
01:20:22,118 --> 01:20:23,986
Yeah.

1279
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,154
Are you?

1280
01:20:25,388 --> 01:20:27,223
Oh yeah.

1281
01:20:27,456 --> 01:20:28,457
Is it out?

1282
01:20:28,691 --> 01:20:29,358
Yeah.

1283
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:31,961
Don't stop.

1284
01:20:32,195 --> 01:20:36,799
I can feel you against
me, hard and throbbing.

1285
01:20:37,033 --> 01:20:39,168
Ah, yeah.

1286
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:41,838
I'd take it in
my hand and stroke

1287
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:45,942
it, like you're doing now.

1288
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:49,812
My hand is warm and firm.

1289
01:20:50,046 --> 01:20:51,447
Can you feel it?

1290
01:20:51,681 --> 01:20:54,584
Yeah, I can.

1291
01:20:54,817 --> 01:20:57,220
I'd pull you
close and kiss you.

1292
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:58,688
I don't do that.

1293
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:00,590
Hey, it's a fantasy.

1294
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:03,259
You'll kiss a monkey
if I want, so shut up.

1295
01:21:03,492 --> 01:21:05,294
OK, fuck it.

1296
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:06,729
Kiss me.

1297
01:21:06,963 --> 01:21:09,665
Stick your tongue in my mouth.

1298
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:14,637
I'd push you back
on the bed and grab

1299
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:17,974
your legs, pushing them back.

1300
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:19,175
Give it to me, Lewis.

1301
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:22,044
I want it.

1302
01:21:22,278 --> 01:21:26,682
I'd grease us both
up and push into you.

1303
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:27,884
Give it to me, Lewis.

1304
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:30,953
I can take it.

1305
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:33,322
[deep breathing]

1306
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:38,294
I'm still screwing you
watching the look of lust

1307
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:39,962
on your face.

1308
01:21:40,196 --> 01:21:41,197
Faster, dude.

1309
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,965
Go faster.

1310
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,268
I need it bad.

1311
01:21:45,501 --> 01:21:46,535
Do you, Coop?

1312
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:47,870
Do you need it bad?

1313
01:21:48,104 --> 01:21:49,305
Yeah, I do.

1314
01:21:49,538 --> 01:21:50,907
I dream about us sometimes.

1315
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:51,807
Come on, Lewis.

1316
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:53,175
Pound me.

1317
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:55,778
Beg me for it.

1318
01:21:56,012 --> 01:21:57,380
Please, Lewis.

1319
01:21:57,613 --> 01:21:58,481
Please, take me.

1320
01:21:58,714 --> 01:21:59,382
It's yours.

1321
01:21:59,615 --> 01:22:00,650
It fucking belongs to you.

1322
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:04,387
Shit.

1323
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,354
I'm close.

1324
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:07,256
You gonna juice me?

1325
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:08,491
Lewis, you gonna--

1326
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:10,359
Hello?

1327
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:13,663
Uncle Cooper, are
you on the phone?

1328
01:22:13,896 --> 01:22:15,264
Uh, you bet, Todd.

1329
01:22:15,498 --> 01:22:16,399
What's up, buddy?

1330
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:19,101
Who are you talking to?

1331
01:22:19,335 --> 01:22:20,569
My friend, Lewis.

1332
01:22:20,803 --> 01:22:21,704
Do you remember him?

1333
01:22:21,938 --> 01:22:23,039
No.

1334
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:24,573
Never mind.

1335
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:26,709
My sister's boy, Lewis.

1336
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:28,210
[Sigh]
- Hey, Todd.

1337
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:29,345
How you doing, kiddo?

1338
01:22:29,578 --> 01:22:30,746
Fine.

1339
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:33,582
Say, Todd Meister, hang
up so Lewis and I can talk.

1340
01:22:33,816 --> 01:22:34,483
OK?

1341
01:22:34,717 --> 01:22:37,353
What you gonna talk about?

1342
01:22:37,586 --> 01:22:39,155
Grown up stuff.

1343
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:42,692
OK, bye.

1344
01:22:42,925 --> 01:22:44,894
Bye, Todd.

1345
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:45,795
[laughing]

1346
01:22:47,763 --> 01:22:49,465
That was intense.

1347
01:22:49,699 --> 01:22:50,399
I know.

1348
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:51,801
Does your sister homeschool?

1349
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:53,436
Cause her kid almost
got an education.

1350
01:22:53,669 --> 01:22:54,337
Ba bing!

1351
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:58,274
No, I meant before.

1352
01:22:58,507 --> 01:22:59,775
That was really hot.

1353
01:23:00,009 --> 01:23:00,710
Yeah, it was.

1354
01:23:05,114 --> 01:23:07,717
Do you really dream
about it, Coop?

1355
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:10,419
Sometimes.

1356
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:12,355
You're smiling, aren't you?

1357
01:23:12,588 --> 01:23:14,023
Maybe.

1358
01:23:14,256 --> 01:23:15,891
Prick.

1359
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,393
Why?

1360
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:21,430
Well, what a short journey
it's been from I don't get

1361
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:23,933
fucked to fuck me harder.

1362
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:24,834
Faster!

1363
01:23:25,067 --> 01:23:26,102
[laughing]

1364
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:28,137
You are a dick.

1365
01:23:30,973 --> 01:23:33,275
Apparently, one
you dream about.

1366
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:34,343
Repeat

1367
01:23:34,577 --> 01:23:35,244
Dick.

1368
01:23:38,848 --> 01:23:43,486
So you want to
come and be abnormal?

1369
01:23:49,425 --> 01:23:50,693
Coop?

1370
01:23:50,926 --> 01:23:52,995
Are you there?

1371
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:54,430
[sniffling]

1372
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,904
What's wrong?

1373
01:24:02,138 --> 01:24:03,839
I wanted to see you, Lewis.

1374
01:24:04,073 --> 01:24:04,740
I really did.

1375
01:24:04,974 --> 01:24:06,909
I miss you.

1376
01:24:07,143 --> 01:24:10,012
I'm so fucking stupid.

1377
01:24:10,246 --> 01:24:10,913
Hey, hey-

1378
01:24:11,147 --> 01:24:14,483
Don't worry about it.

1379
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:15,818
I try to do the right thing.

1380
01:24:16,052 --> 01:24:17,553
But then, I talk to
you and, suddenly,

1381
01:24:17,787 --> 01:24:20,589
you're the right thing.

1382
01:24:20,823 --> 01:24:26,128
Well why, Why don't
you come over then?

1383
01:24:26,362 --> 01:24:28,230
And it's still early.

1384
01:24:28,464 --> 01:24:29,131
Shit.

1385
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:32,601
I'd like to.

1386
01:24:32,835 --> 01:24:35,471
I really would.

1387
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:37,339
But I can't.

1388
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:39,375
I already have plans at home.

1389
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:41,143
Sorry.

1390
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:45,581
It's OK, really.

1391
01:24:45,815 --> 01:24:46,682
You miss a year.

1392
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:47,883
So there's always next year.

1393
01:24:50,119 --> 01:24:50,853
Isn't there?

1394
01:24:55,825 --> 01:24:56,559
We'll see.

1395
01:24:59,361 --> 01:25:01,163
I gotta run.

1396
01:25:01,397 --> 01:25:02,565
Love you, Lewis.

1397
01:25:02,798 --> 01:25:03,566
Love you, Coop.

1398
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:15,544
[music playing]

1399
01:25:56,185 --> 01:25:57,553
Well here we are, sir.

1400
01:25:57,786 --> 01:25:58,454
Yes, I know.

1401
01:25:58,687 --> 01:25:59,755
I come here every year.

1402
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:01,357
Oh, you must really
like our hotel.

1403
01:26:10,299 --> 01:26:11,534
It has its charms.

1404
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:13,636
Would you like me to take
the bag to the bedroom, sir?

1405
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:14,537
Uh, no.

1406
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:15,437
No, thanks.

1407
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:19,575
Uh, um.

1408
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:20,476
Very well, sir.

1409
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:22,411
I'll just leave it right here.

1410
01:26:22,645 --> 01:26:23,312
Great.

1411
01:26:26,749 --> 01:26:27,716
This is for you.

1412
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,051
Thank you, sir.

1413
01:26:29,285 --> 01:26:30,286
Enjoy your stay.

1414
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,187
I always do.

1415
01:27:17,032 --> 01:27:18,934
So how've you been?

1416
01:27:21,637 --> 01:27:23,272
Fine.

1417
01:27:23,505 --> 01:27:24,607
Yourself?

1418
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,574
Can't complain.

1419
01:27:29,545 --> 01:27:32,381
How's business?

1420
01:27:32,615 --> 01:27:33,816
Very good.

1421
01:27:34,049 --> 01:27:35,951
I just hired four new guys.

1422
01:27:36,185 --> 01:27:37,620
That's great.

1423
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:40,089
Take your shoes
and socks off, Lewis.

1424
01:27:40,322 --> 01:27:41,056
Get comfortable.

1425
01:27:50,566 --> 01:27:51,800
Kids doing well?

1426
01:27:52,034 --> 01:27:52,701
OK.

1427
01:27:56,405 --> 01:27:57,840
What's all this about?

1428
01:27:58,073 --> 01:27:58,841
What do you mean?

1429
01:27:59,074 --> 01:28:00,943
You've been here
for five minutes.

1430
01:28:01,176 --> 01:28:03,145
Normally, by now, my legs
would be over your shoulders.

1431
01:28:03,379 --> 01:28:07,116
And you'd be screaming
rap lyrics into my face.

1432
01:28:07,349 --> 01:28:08,484
This isn't the type
of behavior I've

1433
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:12,187
come to expect from the man
that seduced me eight years ago.

1434
01:28:12,421 --> 01:28:15,858
Well now, that's a
whale of a tale, cowboy.

1435
01:28:16,091 --> 01:28:16,925
You seduced me.

1436
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:18,494
And don't you forget it.

1437
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:20,262
Figured that out, did you?

1438
01:28:20,496 --> 01:28:23,332
I guess you are the smart one.

1439
01:28:23,565 --> 01:28:24,933
Dick.

1440
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:28,671
On the other hand, maybe
you're not so smart after all.

1441
01:28:28,904 --> 01:28:30,105
Here's a hot guy--

1442
01:28:30,339 --> 01:28:31,373
Reasonably attractive.

1443
01:28:31,607 --> 01:28:32,708
Don't kid yourself.

1444
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:37,346
Hot guy lying naked
in bed, all for you,

1445
01:28:37,579 --> 01:28:40,683
and you don't seem interested.

1446
01:28:40,916 --> 01:28:43,752
Oh, I'm interested.

1447
01:28:46,922 --> 01:28:48,857
I brought a new toy.

1448
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:49,992
I saw.

1449
01:28:50,225 --> 01:28:53,829
I figured we could play
Arizona interrogation.

1450
01:28:54,063 --> 01:28:55,631
In a minute, maybe.

1451
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:58,434
Just follow the 8O proof road.

1452
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,803
You have come a
long way, haven't you?

1453
01:29:01,036 --> 01:29:02,371
Three steps forward.

1454
01:29:02,604 --> 01:29:04,573
And you're two steps back.

1455
01:29:04,807 --> 01:29:08,277
It never used to be this hard to
get you in between the sheets.

1456
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:14,616
But the last few years--
are you bored with me?

1457
01:29:20,656 --> 01:29:21,490
No.

1458
01:29:21,724 --> 01:29:23,492
Then, what is it?

1459
01:29:23,726 --> 01:29:25,494
Things are different now.

1460
01:29:30,632 --> 01:29:32,434
Fuck it.

1461
01:29:32,668 --> 01:29:33,435
All right.

1462
01:29:57,459 --> 01:29:58,827
Handcuff me.

1463
01:29:59,061 --> 01:29:59,928
Yes, sir.

1464
01:30:00,162 --> 01:30:01,597
No, I call you sir.

1465
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:03,232
You got it.

1466
01:30:03,465 --> 01:30:04,133
I assume there's a key?

1467
01:30:04,366 --> 01:30:05,067
Over there.

1468
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:12,808
Hey!

1469
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:14,376
Get rid of that stupid thing.

1470
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:15,611
Mood buster.

1471
01:30:15,844 --> 01:30:16,545
That's bronco buster.

1472
01:30:19,381 --> 01:30:20,716
Did you bring condoms, partner?

1473
01:30:20,949 --> 01:30:21,650
No.

1474
01:30:21,884 --> 01:30:23,452
Well, how are we gonna--

1475
01:30:23,685 --> 01:30:25,487
I don't want to use them.

1476
01:30:25,721 --> 01:30:26,455
What?

1477
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:28,791
I don't want to
use them this time.

1478
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:29,725
I don't know.

1479
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:30,726
Come on, Lewis.

1480
01:30:30,959 --> 01:30:32,227
Please.

1481
01:30:32,461 --> 01:30:33,228
[Sigh]

1482
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:44,139
Where's the lube?

1483
01:30:44,373 --> 01:30:48,210
I am rinsed, and
buttered, and ready to play.

1484
01:30:48,444 --> 01:30:51,346
Now ride me like a
teacup at Disneyland.

1485
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:55,317
Fuck.

1486
01:30:55,551 --> 01:30:56,652
Have you got bigger?

1487
01:30:56,885 --> 01:30:57,553
Maybe.

1488
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:58,987
You sure haven't gotten tighter.

1489
01:30:59,221 --> 01:30:59,988
Fuck you.

1490
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,161
[heavy breathing]

1491
01:31:25,547 --> 01:31:26,682
Talk to me, sir.

1492
01:31:26,915 --> 01:31:27,749
Do you like it?

1493
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:29,251
You're the best, Coop.

1494
01:31:29,485 --> 01:31:32,521
The best I've ever had.

1495
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:33,755
How's it feel?

1496
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:35,224
Great!

1497
01:31:35,457 --> 01:31:36,225
Awesome.

1498
01:31:39,862 --> 01:31:41,530
You like my cock in your ass?

1499
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:42,431
Oh, I love it, sir.

1500
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:43,365
I love it.

1501
01:31:43,599 --> 01:31:44,266
I love you.

1502
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:51,406
Say that again.

1503
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:52,908
I love your cock in my ass.

1504
01:32:01,984 --> 01:32:02,951
Don't!

1505
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:04,887
Don't you kiss me like that.

1506
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,722
Like what?

1507
01:32:06,955 --> 01:32:08,056
A distraction.

1508
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:12,261
You kissed me to change the
subject, you little bastard.

1509
01:32:12,494 --> 01:32:16,632
Looks like playtime is over.

1510
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:18,600
Lewis, can you
take these cuffs off?

1511
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:24,006
Lewis.

1512
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:25,541
Listen, Lewis, let me go!

1513
01:32:59,007 --> 01:33:02,210
Where do you see
us in 'I0 years, Coop?

1514
01:33:02,444 --> 01:33:06,915
Still meeting here in
this room every 'I2 months?

1515
01:33:07,149 --> 01:33:09,751
Why not?

1516
01:33:09,985 --> 01:33:11,320
Things change.

1517
01:33:11,553 --> 01:33:12,254
Like what?

1518
01:33:17,559 --> 01:33:18,594
I call three questions.

1519
01:33:18,827 --> 01:33:19,494
Damn.

1520
01:33:19,728 --> 01:33:20,929
I'm invoking.

1521
01:33:21,163 --> 01:33:22,197
Ask.

1522
01:33:22,431 --> 01:33:23,498
Question one.

1523
01:33:23,732 --> 01:33:25,567
You say things are different
now, that things changed.

1524
01:33:25,801 --> 01:33:26,768
We've been messing
around for years.

1525
01:33:27,002 --> 01:33:27,669
Messing around.

1526
01:33:27,903 --> 01:33:28,837
What's different?

1527
01:33:32,874 --> 01:33:37,045
I have a boyfriend now.

1528
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:39,548
So.

1529
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:40,449
So?

1530
01:33:43,518 --> 01:33:45,554
So?

1531
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:48,390
You've got the balls to say so?

1532
01:33:48,624 --> 01:33:50,892
How many times over
the last eight years

1533
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:53,362
have I heard you moan
regrets like a Tennessee

1534
01:33:53,595 --> 01:33:54,796
Williams heroine?

1535
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:56,798
Oh, I'm cheating on my Wife.

1536
01:33:57,032 --> 01:33:59,835
Oh, I feel so guilty.
Oh.

1537
01:34:00,068 --> 01:34:02,838
Now fuck me.

1538
01:34:03,071 --> 01:34:05,807
I have a boyfriend now.

1539
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:08,276
I'd think you'd feel
a little empathy.

1540
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:10,145
But that's different.

1541
01:34:10,379 --> 01:34:14,650
And just how is
that different?

1542
01:34:14,883 --> 01:34:15,651
Wife and children.

1543
01:34:15,884 --> 01:34:17,019
Rock solid relationship.

1544
01:34:17,252 --> 01:34:19,154
Not like a boyfriend.

1545
01:34:19,388 --> 01:34:20,055
Why?

1546
01:34:20,288 --> 01:34:21,323
Is it abnormal?

1547
01:34:21,556 --> 01:34:22,224
Of course not!

1548
01:34:22,457 --> 01:34:24,760
It's just unbalanced.

1549
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:30,098
A boyfriend is not the same
level of commitment as a wife.

1550
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:32,734
Oh because gay
relationships aren't

1551
01:34:32,968 --> 01:34:34,136
as valid as straight
relationships.

1552
01:34:34,369 --> 01:34:36,038
No!

1553
01:34:36,271 --> 01:34:38,674
I mean, yes.

1554
01:34:38,907 --> 01:34:41,877
What I mean is, if you had
said girlfriend instead

1555
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:44,579
of boyfriend, other than
wondering Whether I was living

1556
01:34:44,813 --> 01:34:46,982
in a parallel
universe, I would have

1557
01:34:47,215 --> 01:34:49,284
had the exact same reaction.

1558
01:34:49,518 --> 01:34:52,554
Boyfriends is little
winks when you

1559
01:34:52,788 --> 01:34:54,256
think that nobody's looking.

1560
01:34:54,489 --> 01:34:57,092
It's a quick hand job
at the movie theater.

1561
01:34:57,325 --> 01:35:01,563
Wives is, meatloaf again?

1562
01:35:01,797 --> 01:35:03,265
Is there gas in my car?

1563
01:35:03,498 --> 01:35:07,436
Or can you not scratch your
balls when my mother is home?

1564
01:35:07,669 --> 01:35:09,638
That's all I meant.

1565
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:17,112
Yeah but, whenever you had
doubts, I threaded that needle.

1566
01:35:17,345 --> 01:35:18,947
Think you could do the same?

1567
01:35:19,181 --> 01:35:21,917
You always said that it
shouldn't matter to me.

1568
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:23,418
So then, why should
it matter to you?

1569
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:29,524
That's another question.

1570
01:35:29,758 --> 01:35:32,127
My turn.

1571
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,830
Question one.

1572
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:37,165
Have you slept with
any men other than me?

1573
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:39,334
You asked me that years ago.

1574
01:35:39,568 --> 01:35:44,172
Well you've had a lot of
time for that answer to change.

1575
01:35:44,406 --> 01:35:45,073
Well?

1576
01:35:45,307 --> 01:35:46,374
No.

1577
01:35:46,608 --> 01:35:47,275
OK, question two.
Why--

1578
01:35:47,509 --> 01:35:48,343
Wait, Wait, Wait, Wait.

1579
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:49,778
I feel like there
should be more to that.

1580
01:35:50,011 --> 01:35:50,679
There isn't, Lewis.

1581
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:51,613
The answer is no.

1582
01:35:51,847 --> 01:35:53,148
All right?

1583
01:35:53,381 --> 01:35:54,483
Question two.

1584
01:35:54,716 --> 01:35:56,918
You say that it shouldn't
matter that I cheat on my Wife.

1585
01:35:57,152 --> 01:35:59,187
Why then should it matter that
you cheat on your boyfriend?

1586
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:05,327
It's different.

1587
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:06,294
He's sick.

1588
01:36:09,397 --> 01:36:11,767
Do you mean?

1589
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,734
Ah, shit, Lewis!

1590
01:36:12,968 --> 01:36:14,302
How could you do that?

1591
01:36:14,536 --> 01:36:18,006
How could you be with somebody
who could give you something?

1592
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:20,442
What about the year
you gave me crabs?

1593
01:36:20,675 --> 01:36:21,343
They weren't crabs!

1594
01:36:21,576 --> 01:36:22,611
They were lice!

1595
01:36:22,844 --> 01:36:24,246
The wife got them from
the kids at school.

1596
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:25,380
It's acceptable.

1597
01:36:25,614 --> 01:36:26,348
I don't know.

1598
01:36:26,581 --> 01:36:27,649
I'm not the one
scratching my balls

1599
01:36:27,883 --> 01:36:28,784
in front of my mother in law.

1600
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:39,027
Turn off your scanner, Coop.

1601
01:36:39,261 --> 01:36:40,262
You're safe.

1602
01:36:40,495 --> 01:36:41,963
I wouldn't have done
what we just did unless I

1603
01:36:42,197 --> 01:36:44,166
was 100% absolutely sure.

1604
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:46,668
But there's a risk.

1605
01:36:46,902 --> 01:36:48,003
Sex is risky, Coop.

1606
01:36:48,236 --> 01:36:48,904
Always.

1607
01:36:53,909 --> 01:36:55,343
What's his name?

1608
01:36:55,577 --> 01:36:59,848
New boyfriend.
- That's another question.

1609
01:37:00,081 --> 01:37:04,986
Just, just answer it.

1610
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:07,322
Bernie.

1611
01:37:07,556 --> 01:37:08,824
His name is Bernie.

1612
01:37:13,395 --> 01:37:15,730
OK, my turn.

1613
01:37:15,964 --> 01:37:16,631
Question two.

1614
01:37:19,768 --> 01:37:23,672
Have you ever thought
of leaving your wife?

1615
01:37:23,905 --> 01:37:24,573
Yes.

1616
01:37:27,709 --> 01:37:29,811
Uh, elaborate please.

1617
01:37:30,045 --> 01:37:31,112
I answered your question.

1618
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:32,480
Not to my satisfaction.

1619
01:37:32,714 --> 01:37:34,049
That's not a
requirement of the game.

1620
01:37:37,052 --> 01:37:37,953
Fine.
Question three.

1621
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:38,854
No, no, no.

1622
01:37:39,087 --> 01:37:39,888
It's my turn!

1623
01:37:40,121 --> 01:37:40,789
Yeah, yeah.

1624
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:41,790
After this.

1625
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:43,491
Question three.

1626
01:37:43,725 --> 01:37:46,761
Why am I the only guy
you've ever had sex with?

1627
01:37:46,995 --> 01:37:50,265
There's got to be one or two
other guys more attractive

1628
01:37:50,498 --> 01:37:52,467
than I am out there.

1629
01:37:52,701 --> 01:37:55,370
Maybe I like the smart ones.

1630
01:37:55,604 --> 01:37:57,839
Seriously.

1631
01:37:58,073 --> 01:38:04,012
Lewis, I've always felt that
there was a spark between us.

1632
01:38:04,246 --> 01:38:04,913
I don't know.

1633
01:38:05,146 --> 01:38:08,483
I can't explain it.

1634
01:38:08,717 --> 01:38:09,651
Something about
you has always made

1635
01:38:09,885 --> 01:38:11,987
my skin tingle when We touch.

1636
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:14,522
My heart pounds when I
think about you naked.

1637
01:38:14,756 --> 01:38:17,926
Every expression on your face
is chiseled into my memory.

1638
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:18,827
I don't know why.

1639
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,095
It just is.

1640
01:38:20,328 --> 01:38:23,298
And you are the only man
that's made me feel like that!

1641
01:38:23,531 --> 01:38:24,432
So am <i>l</i> 93V?

1642
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:26,301
Am I bisexual?

1643
01:38:26,534 --> 01:38:29,504
If I was, wouldn't I feel
like that for another man?

1644
01:38:29,738 --> 01:38:30,405
I don't!

1645
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:31,806
Just you!

1646
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:35,310
Only you.

1647
01:38:35,543 --> 01:38:36,544
But you said you loved me.

1648
01:38:36,778 --> 01:38:37,445
God!

1649
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:38,680
I do, Lewis!

1650
01:38:38,914 --> 01:38:41,216
I love you so much!

1651
01:38:41,449 --> 01:38:45,587
This, this was supposed
to be the night, man.

1652
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:46,488
The night?

1653
01:38:46,721 --> 01:38:47,489
[Sigh]

1654
01:38:47,722 --> 01:38:48,957
The night!

1655
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:51,960
The night!

1656
01:38:52,193 --> 01:38:53,895
The night I told you I
wanted us to be together.

1657
01:38:58,833 --> 01:38:59,901
I've known that you wanted this.

1658
01:39:00,135 --> 01:39:02,037
I've known it for a long time.

1659
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:09,577
You got a wife, Coop.

1660
01:39:09,811 --> 01:39:13,048
And children.

1661
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:15,016
It would destroy them.

1662
01:39:18,153 --> 01:39:20,522
They need you.

1663
01:39:20,755 --> 01:39:22,023
But don't you need me?

1664
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:28,363
I used to.

1665
01:39:28,596 --> 01:39:31,266
But now--

1666
01:39:31,499 --> 01:39:33,935
You've got Bernie.

1667
01:39:34,169 --> 01:39:34,836
Yeah.

1668
01:39:37,973 --> 01:39:39,641
Look at me.

1669
01:39:39,874 --> 01:39:43,445
We've always been able
to read each other.

1670
01:39:43,678 --> 01:39:46,247
Question three.

1671
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:48,650
Are you telling me the
truth about Bernie?

1672
01:39:52,287 --> 01:39:53,021
Yes.

1673
01:39:56,024 --> 01:39:57,058
So your answer for me is--

1674
01:39:57,292 --> 01:40:00,362
Cooper, remember when
you told me about your dad

1675
01:40:00,595 --> 01:40:06,067
leaving, how it made you feel?

1676
01:40:06,301 --> 01:40:08,536
Why would you do
that to your kids?

1677
01:40:14,609 --> 01:40:17,078
You're not your father.

1678
01:40:17,312 --> 01:40:21,549
You're not gonna do
this to your family.

1679
01:40:21,783 --> 01:40:27,856
And soulmate or not,
they are your family.

1680
01:40:28,089 --> 01:40:29,357
They love you.

1681
01:40:32,961 --> 01:40:36,264
That's more important than us.

1682
01:40:36,498 --> 01:40:40,301
That sounds like one
of your $3.95 paperbacks.

1683
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:42,003
$4.95!

1684
01:40:42,237 --> 01:40:44,272
$13.95 hardcover.

1685
01:40:44,506 --> 01:40:49,144
I beg your forgiveness.

1686
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:53,548
Seriously, I'm sorry.

1687
01:40:53,782 --> 01:40:54,516
For what?

1688
01:40:57,519 --> 01:40:58,253
You've got someone.

1689
01:41:01,356 --> 01:41:03,458
I've got someone.

1690
01:41:03,691 --> 01:41:05,393
L'm haPPY-

1691
01:41:05,627 --> 01:41:07,362
YOu?

1692
01:41:07,595 --> 01:41:12,267
Yeah, as long as
you're a part of my life.

1693
01:41:16,838 --> 01:41:19,841
I better go.

1694
01:41:20,075 --> 01:41:20,842
Go now.

1695
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:33,288
You know, you can keep these.

1696
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:34,189
Thanks.

1697
01:41:54,209 --> 01:41:56,478
Next year.

1698
01:41:56,711 --> 01:41:59,948
We'll see.

1699
01:42:00,181 --> 01:42:01,950
Love you, Lewis.

1700
01:42:02,183 --> 01:42:03,418
I love you, Coop.

1701
01:42:53,301 --> 01:42:56,471
Why is our love
impossible, Stephen asked.

1702
01:42:56,704 --> 01:42:59,707
We are meant to be one.

1703
01:42:59,941 --> 01:43:02,577
It is not our destiny,
Jenny replied.

1704
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:07,448
I will not be the one
to destroy your family.

1705
01:43:07,682 --> 01:43:08,883
They love you.

1706
01:43:09,117 --> 01:43:14,422
And if that is meant to be
and we are not, so be it.

1707
01:43:20,461 --> 01:43:21,763
[knocking]

1708
01:43:32,674 --> 01:43:33,441
Good evening, sir.

1709
01:43:33,675 --> 01:43:34,642
May I bring this in?

1710
01:43:34,876 --> 01:43:36,010
I didn't order anything.

1711
01:43:36,244 --> 01:43:37,979
Compliments of the house, sir.

1712
01:43:49,891 --> 01:43:51,526
Wow, this looks amazing.

1713
01:43:51,759 --> 01:43:54,229
But it's way too much
food here for one person.

1714
01:43:54,462 --> 01:43:56,264
Oh, I just got off work, sir.

1715
01:43:56,497 --> 01:44:01,302
You were my last
delivery of the night.

1716
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:03,605
Would you care for
some dessert, Bernie?

1717
01:44:03,838 --> 01:44:04,505
Thank you.

1718
01:44:15,149 --> 01:44:17,151
Uh, my name's
Lewis, by the way.

1719
01:44:17,385 --> 01:44:18,052
Yes, I know.

1720
01:44:18,286 --> 01:44:19,821
Very nice to meet you, sir.

1721
01:44:25,293 --> 01:44:27,061
Oh, it looks like you've
already got something to drink.

1722
01:44:30,031 --> 01:44:32,634
Open her up.
I've always hated whiskey.

1723
01:44:39,274 --> 01:44:42,343
