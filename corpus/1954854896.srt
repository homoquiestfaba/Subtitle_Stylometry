what you wrote me...

1776
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:30,758
I think that maybe
if I would have

1777
01:40:30,758 --> 01:40:32,385
read this earlier... somehow...

1778
01:40:32,659 --> 01:40:34,855
things could have
been different.

1779
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:40,000
Everyone keeps telling me how it
was a miracle that I lived...

1780
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,702
that it was a miracle that a cop

1781
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:43,437
just happened to be in the area

1782
01:40:43,437 --> 01:40:45,506
responding to a false report...

1783
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:48,709
but I like to believe that
you... you somehow were

1784
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,473
responsible for him
being there...

1785
01:40:51,512 --> 01:40:53,547
but who really knows, right?

1786
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:55,413
What happens after life?

1787
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:57,518
Is there a heaven?

1788
01:40:58,052 --> 01:40:59,918
Are you watching over me?

1789
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:03,385
Can you hear me right now, Ben?

1790
01:41:05,225 --> 01:41:07,161
I remember my Dad
telling me that you

1791
01:41:07,161 --> 01:41:08,993
loved me by the way
you looked at me...

1792
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:13,831
what I would do to see you
look at me one last time...

1793
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:15,869
to see your eyes...

1794
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:17,359
to hear your voice...

1795
01:41:18,038 --> 01:41:20,200
to feel your touch
one last time.

1796
01:41:22,509 --> 01:41:24,678
I know life goes on,
and I know I have to

1797
01:41:24,678 --> 01:41:26,806
figure out where I'm
going from here...

1798
01:41:27,548 --> 01:41:30,540
but I know that you
will always be with me...

1799
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:33,042
and I will always love you, Ben.

1800
01:41:34,555 --> 01:41:35,579
Always.
