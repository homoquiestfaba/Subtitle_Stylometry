1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hey, wake up! Hurry!

2
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,999
Is this the rain, mummy?

3
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
No, this is like rain!

4
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don’t! Come back!

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He went away, he’ s gone!

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He flew away!...

7
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,999
Stop it! I told you not to joke about it.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He went away...

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Are you hungry?

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is the only food we have left.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Eat!

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I’ m going to eat with Cloudy.

13
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,975
I'm going to eat quicker.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,999
A spoon for me...

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
a spoon for her.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yummy!

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Have you finished your studying for today?

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes!... Should I say it?

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
“A”...

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
”F”,

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
”H”

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No!... It’s A, B, C, D, E, F...

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let’ s see what you can read!
This is the only book we have.

24
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:49,835
Here!

25
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,119
There ....

26
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,920
There is... C’ mon Sarah, try it!

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There... is...

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
a spe- cial

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
There is a special procedure in
order to operate the uterus.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don’ t understand.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We should work on a little bit more..

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What’ s the uterus?

33
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:39,654
Uterus!

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, it’ s Cloudy’ s home... It was
yours and your brother’ s home.

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Every woman has inside of her a little
house for the babies. You, too.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I want to see them.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Sometimes I think it’ s better
for them not to be here.

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Maybe you shouldn’ t think
about them that much, honey.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They see the real stars, right?

40
00:04:17,484 --> 00:04:18,746
Yeah...

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Mum, in which house where you born?

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
In grandma’s home. I’ ve
already told you, remember?

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I want to meet grandma.

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
She’ s upstairs...

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Doesn’t want to see us?

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,280
She doesn’ t know we are here...

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
or maybe she doesn’t even care.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Did you draw the line for today, sweety?

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, go!

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Every seven days we have to count them.
1, 2 ,3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It’ s 8182 days.

52
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:03,544
Mum!

53
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Mum! I’ m hungry.

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I want to eat bulbs.

55
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Here, drink some water! You’
ll not be hungry anymore.

56
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Do you like it?

57
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It’s a rabbit? Very nice. Well done!

58
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Please now, let’s sleep!
I’m not feeling well.

59
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ma mamma, non voglio dormire.

60
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, God...

61
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
OK. Think about an animal
that starts with an “E”.

62
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hum... Hyena?

63
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
No! But you should try drawing it, anyway.

64
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, sweety! What happened?

65
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, maybe it’s the hot temperature downhere.

66
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let’s take a shower!

67
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You’ll feel better.

68
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I will do it by myself.

69
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Really? You want to take
the shower by your own?

70
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Now that’s my baby!

71
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Drink that tea, honey!

72
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Sarah, did you eat the butter?

73
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Without any bread?

74
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
There were no bulbs.

75
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Now we know how you got sick!

76
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Did you take your shower?

77
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You know that you shouldn’ t lie to mummy.
Why don’ t you ever wash yourself?

78
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don’t you realize how much you stink?

79
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don’t stink!

80
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes you stink!

81
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No, I’m not. No, I’m not. No, I’m not!

82
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, my God! You have flies
hanging around your head.

83
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How horrible creatures they are!
They will eat your brain, too.

84
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, no. Please take them off , mummy!

85
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
OK, OK, I’ ll help you take your shower.
Do you want to make the rain?

86
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,760
Yeah, I like the rain. Please take them off!

87
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Flies hate the rain, did you know that?

88
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Do you like it? Can you see that?
It’s very funny!

89
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Father, thank you for the food
that you put on our table today

90
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
for all the goodness that you give us!

91
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Be loved here and everywhere, just
the way we feel loved by you!

92
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
God bless you, father!

93
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Sweety!...

94
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Please, say it!

95
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Thank you , father!

96
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Total lack of manners!

97
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Now, before I forget...

98
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Take these!

99
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It’ s too early. I haven’ t even
reached the seventh month yet.

100
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Shut up!

101
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Where is my glass?

102
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,080
Like mother, like daughter.

103
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:07,706
No!

104
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You! You go and get your father a glass!

105
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Did you hear what I said, you little shit?

106
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,080
Please, leave her alone! You
know she’ s not able...

107
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You, idiot!

108
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
OK, fine! You don’ t wanna obey?

109
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You don’t eat!

110
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I’ ve learned gratitude in my life...
And you? You’ re gonna learn it too.

111
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Respect is earned, is not given.
It’ s two way street.

112
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You don’t show respect, you don’t get any...

113
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This, not to be eaten.

114
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Julia, Christian, Michael, George, Mathew

115
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah! That was taken into our swimming pool.
See what a good time they’ re having?

116
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I treat them with love.

117
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What’s the matter with you? You look
like a bladder that’ s gonna burst!

118
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They live here with me and we’ re a family.

119
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You should be happy.

120
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Please, leave it to me!

121
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
At least the photo...

122
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,491
He left...

123
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Hey, sweety! Everything is OK. Come to mamma!

124
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I want to see the real stars.

125
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, I know.

126
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Mum, why do you always cut my hair?

127
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:24,007
Well, because he said so...

128
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But I need to have a very long hair so the
prince can climb on and take us away from here.

129
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Are you sure the fairytales princes exist?

130
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I’ ll throw my hair out the window, anyway.

131
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Well, this isn’t a castle tower,
it doesn’t even have windows ...

132
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
it doesn’t even have windows.

133
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Now help me with some housework! OK?

134
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Hi! Nice to meet you. My name is Rapunzel.

135
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Stop fooling around! Give me a hand here!

136
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This is Pascal, my little chameleon friend.

137
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Pascal, this is my mum. Do you like her?
Isn’t she beautiful?

138
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That’s it! You don’t want to have fun.
My hair is not magic at all!

139
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Put those scissors back!

140
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Now I’ m going to cut it!

141
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Sarah, stop it! I need those scissors.

142
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Put them back!

143
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Put them back in the drawer!
Come here and help me!

144
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:45,103
Take this!

145
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Why is dad so mean to us?
Can he just be nice to us?

146
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Because he’ s an ogre. You should know that
an ogre never changes, he remains the same.

147
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I tried them all. Worse is
when you go against his will.

148
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Never do that again, Sarah!
He can get even meaner.

149
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I do as I want!

150
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
No, you do whatever I ask you to.

151
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I do whatever I want, this
is how it’ s going to be!

152
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh, yeah? Now, you’ re old enough to
understand how it works, young lady!

153
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Can you see these? Can you?

154
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
As you play with it, these aren’ t
for your entertainment, young lady.

155
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,975
These were for me!...

156
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I was chained like a dog for a year,
with no food, no electricity,

157
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
For weeks, for months... And this was
only because I was a rebel girl.

158
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There’ s no way to transform
an ogre into a prince.

159
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
A charming prince!

160
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Behave yourself, missy!

161
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh, my God! I’ m sorry, honey. I’ m sorry.

162
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I just want you to be good when he’ s around.

163
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Be good! Be good when he’ s around!

164
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Don’ t you ever do that again!
You’ re going to break it!

165
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It’ s amazing! These walls are full of condensation
during the summer. One day we might wake- up in a broth.

166
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You wanna become the chicken in the broth?

167
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
No, I don’ t wanna stay in a broth!

168
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Well, that’s going to happen if
you put the pencil in the rotor.

169
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,160
I think you wanna be tickled.

170
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Come here you little chick!

171
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That’ s it! You made me sweat.
Let’s lie down for a bit!

172
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Mum, have you ever run in
the woods like Rapunzel?

173
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yes, I did.

174
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And the woods has a different
fragrance, especially when it rains.

175
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The earth is covered with green moss and makes
a strange noise while nourishing with water.

176
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Then the wind moves the leaves,
the birds sing all together.

177
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The rain makes a different rustle if it falls
on the leaves or if it falls on the concrete.

178
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
When the drops fall on metal,
they seem like stilettos.

179
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We used to go to collect mushrooms,
chasing each other around the trees

180
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
We laughed and played

181
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It was an enchanted world
in all that symphony.

182
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
Where you living in a cartoon?

183
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Sometimes I think I was. This is
reality, that was only a cartoon.

184
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I would like to live in a cartoon, too.
I don’t like life.

185
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
If I could I would draw it for you, baby.

186
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:48,301
Oh, my God!...

187
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:50,007
It’ s too early.

188
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:22,903
Help!

189
00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:54,587
Oh, my God!...

190
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I cannot take it anymore.

191
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Somebody help me. please!

192
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Help me!

193
00:27:26,034 --> 00:27:28,345
You’ re so beautiful!

194
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Mummy’ s sweetheart...

195
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The scissors! I need to take the scissors.

196
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Did you see it? It’ s a baby boy.

197
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Really? Can we call him Pascal?

198
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Pascal, the chameleon?

199
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I’ ll think about it.

200
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Dad will not take him away, too. Am I right?

201
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I don’ t know, sweety. Maybe... He
has too many children up there.

202
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
He’ s making strange noises.

203
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Bring the book to mummy!

204
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I think he’ s having a breathing failure.

205
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Go get the cooling fan to mummy!

206
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Did you hear that? Go get the fan!

207
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Now what?

208
00:32:27,673 --> 00:32:28,673
Say it!

209
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
It’ s not working.

210
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Help! Somebody help me, please!

211
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Oh, my God! What should I do now?

212
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:54,082
Help!

213
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I need to give a good impression to Pascal.

214
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You have to take him to the hospital.
He’ s not breathing well.

215
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Please, I cannot even feed him.

216
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Are you listening to me?

217
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I’ ll do whatever you want me to do. Please!

218
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:56,536
Please!

219
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
That’ s a great idea! What am I supposed
to say when they ask me where I got him?

220
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
No problem. We’ ll do the same you
made me do with the other babies.

221
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Right! Just as with the others.

222
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Dear mum and dad

223
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I cannot take care of my newborn baby.
His name is...

224
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Pascal... Right! Pascal!

225
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I am fine but I have some money problems

226
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Thank you for the help you’ re giving me!

227
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Love, Sharon.

228
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
This kid will get you more
social security checks.

229
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You’ ll have more money,
just like with the others.

230
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:35,000
C’ mon! Quite a big number, yeah?
You always complain about money!

231
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Have you finished?

232
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I’ m begging you!

233
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Take him to the hospital,
you can leave him there!

234
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You should burn in hell!

235
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Dear God, tell wind to blow a bit of air!

236
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
My little brother needs it and mum
says that you can make things better.

237
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I’ ll teach my brother to be nice to you and
I’ ll never use the pencil against you.

238
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Never ever and forever. Amen.

239
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
He’ s eating, you see?

240
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Now he has to take some breaks
so he wouldn’ t suffocate.

241
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Everything will be ok, sweety.

242
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I’ ll write his name so I can
attach it next to the others.

243
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Mum, maybe you should write it.

244
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
No, sweety, you can do it! C’ mon, try it!

245
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
P – A...

246
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
S...

247
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Honey, are we sure that we want to call your brother
like that lizard or chameleon, whatever it is?

248
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
C–A...

249
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and L.

250
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Is it right?

251
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
That’ s perfect. Good girl!

252
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
When will dad come back?

253
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Now that I remember, it passed ten days
since you were born and he didn’ t know it.

254
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I’ ve always been in this tower, right?

255
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Honey, this is not a tower, it’ s a basement.
Anyway, yes. You were all born here.

256
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Did you see what I’ ve done? It’ s Pascal.

257
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Nice...

258
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I wonder how is their basement.
Did they have one?

259
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Mummy...

260
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I wanna play with my brothers.

261
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Yes, I know, sweety. Mum’s very tired. Why don’ t you
go and check out whats’ s in the box he brought.

262
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:48,850
Hi!

263
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
What are you?

264
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Hello!

265
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
C’ mon! Talk to me!

266
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I don’ t understand.

267
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
What are you trying to tell me?

268
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Do you understand me? Do you
understand what I’ m saying?

269
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Mum! Mum! I have a friend.

270
00:40:47,504 --> 00:40:48,504
Mum!

271
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
He lives in the box.

272
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
What’ s this?

273
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Oh, no!

274
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:21,206
No!

275
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
He’ s dead!

276
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
He’ s dead!

277
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Hey! My new tenant complained about hearing
noises from down here. I bet it was you!

278
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Was it you?

279
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Have you seen what you’ ve done?
You killed him!

280
00:42:50,406 --> 00:42:51,406
What?

281
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Where do you take him?
Bring my baby back to me!

282
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Shut up! Another word of either of you, another sound and I
will kill the kids upstairs. They’ ll all look like this.

283
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It’s broken!

284
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Oh, sweety! Calm down!

285
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
OK, I got it! It’ s right
for you to be angry.

286
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Please, Sarah! The only thing that keeps me going
on is the hope that one day we will al be together.

287
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I know we’ ll make it. I don’ t know how,
I don’ t know when, but we’ ll make it!

288
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I’ m angry, too, you know?

289
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Listen! Why don’ t you introduce me to your
new friend? That’ s goldfish, you know?

290
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
C’ mon! Take off that fake belly.
Kids don’ t born to pillows.

291
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Yes, they do.

292
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I did nothing but protect you. You
were 16, you were so rebellious.

293
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
All you wanted to do was run around with
boys and get yourself into trouble.

294
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I thought it was safer to protect you.

295
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh, yeah? This is why you planned to design
this place ten years before I got here?

296
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Shut up! I’ m your father, I
know what’s best for you.

297
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I’ m a respectable man, I would have
had the whole town laughing at me.

298
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I’ m a good man.

299
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I brought you some food.

300
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Non volevo che finisse in questo modo ...

301
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
End what?

302
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I didn’ t want to burn the baby.

303
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
You did what?

304
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I put the little baby on the fire.

305
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
You, bastard.

306
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
You killed him, you murdered my baby...

307
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I hate you... I hate you with all my heart.

308
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You don’ t have the guts!

309
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I have the code to that
door up here in my brain

310
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
But you wouldn’ t understand that, would you?
Because you don’ t have a brain!

311
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
You were about to kill your only hope.

312
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Thank you!

313
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I have a fever. I think I got an infection.

314
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Did he bring the medicines?

315
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Wake me up if he comes!

316
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I think somebody’ s spying on me.

317
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Come up and say hello!

318
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
What an ungracious girl I raised!

319
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Look at this! These are your brothers.
They’ re crazy about me.

320
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Oh, yeah! We laugh and we have fun... And we go to
the park and at the cinema, and we go in the woods.

321
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I’ d like to be friends with you, too.

322
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Would you like that?

323
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
What’s the matter? Cat got your tongue?

324
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Did you see what your mother did?

325
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:01,000
She threatened me with a knife. Yeah! I was just bringing
some food and some apples for you and she wanted to kill me.

326
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Did you see that?

327
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Answer me!

328
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Spiteful! Just like your mother.

329
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So he passed by. What did he say?

330
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Stop mouthing like a fish! What did he say?

331
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,640
Why didn’ t you wake me up as I told you?

332
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Damn it!

333
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
How the hell am I supposed to take this?
He left us without water again!

334
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Talks about friendship!

335
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
OK, I’ ll chew it.

336
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
He doesn’ t talk anymore.

337
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I swear, sweety, I didn’ t mean to.

338
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You killed fish.

339
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
No, you don’ t have to say that!

340
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
My only friend.

341
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Come here! I told you I didn’ t mean to.

342
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I am depressed, I’ m on the edge.

343
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
There’ s no difference between us and
this little fish, do you understand?

344
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
He lives in a bowl and
we are locked in a cage.

345
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Non riesco a ricordare come
ci si sente a stare fuori.

346
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I was free, I was awake, I was alive.

347
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Look at you! It’ s like you were never born, you
are dead. We are dead! Just like this fish.

348
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Oh, my God! What did I tell you?

349
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Honey, did you understand
what I’ ve just said?

350
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
OK! Let’ s clean this mess up!

351
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
You and I have to come up with something...

352
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,000
If we get out of here, you’ ll have all the
friends you want, but not your father.

353
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I have a feeling, he’ s up to no good!

354
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
We have to avoid that before it happens.
I have to think about it.

355
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Now, go draw the line for today!

356
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,000
P - L - E– H

357
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Bravo! That’s my girl. Give me five!

358
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Surprise!

359
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Merry Christmas!

360
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Yeah, it’ s Christmas.

361
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Go on, give your father a kiss!

362
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Oh, I got...

363
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I got something for you.

364
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I knew you’ d like it... I have good tastes.

365
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Well, we’ re freezing down here. You should
bring us some blankets, we really need it.

366
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Always needs... Why you wanna... Why you
wanna ruin my Christmas with your needs?

367
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
C’ mon! I’ m happy today.

368
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Oh, these braids look pretty on you! Huh,
I told you they’ d look good on you...

369
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,638
C’ mon!

370
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Please, it’ s too cold.

371
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I’ ll warm you up. Get on your knees! C’ mon!

372
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Get off! What’ s wrong with you?
Did you forget how to do it?

373
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I’ m coming back for lunch, set the table!

374
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Hey, Sarah! Wake up!

375
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Remember our “help note”?
Today is our chance!

376
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
C’ mon, Sarah!

377
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
There’ s also something you would really like.
00:58:35 – 00:58:36 Today is Christmas!

378
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Today is Christmas!

379
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:56,000
He’s finally wearing a jacket. When we’ ll sit down to eat,
he will put it on the backrest, I’ m sure. You gotta help me!

380
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Did you bring the tree
from the cartoon, mummy?

381
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Yes, sweety!

382
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Listen! You stay here, I
got some things to do.

383
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
He’ ll see the flooded bathroom and
will have to check the piping system.

384
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Here’ s the note! Remember
what you have to do?

385
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
You have to put it in his jacket, ok?

386
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
No, you do it!

387
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I’ ve already done it, it didn’ t work!

388
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Since then, he always gets his eyes on me.

389
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
He will not expect this from you...

390
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I’ m scared.

391
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Oh, amore... Nel caso peggiore, penserà che sono lettere
casuali che hai scritto per imparare l'alfabeto.

392
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
He will not understand that
this is a secret code.

393
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,000
We have to try. Otherwise,
we’ll never leave this place.

394
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Then we’ ll live in a cartoon as Rapunzel?

395
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
In fairytales cartoons, right!

396
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Oh my gosh! Let’ s get out of here!

397
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I turned on the heat.

398
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
You’ re welcome!

399
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:22,869
Father...

400
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
No!

401
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:34,000
It’ s Christmas, I want her to do it! I
wanna see if she’ s got any gratitude.

402
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
You know that she’ s not able...

403
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Shut up!

404
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I’ m waiting.

405
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Father...

406
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Father, thank you for this food, for all
the love and affection you give us!

407
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Be loved here and everywhere...

408
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Be here and everywhere loved by all as we... Your
daughters feel loved by you. Thank you, father!

409
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Cheers!

410
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Let’ s eat!

411
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Oh, I love chicken!

412
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
With its tiny brain ...

413
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
its stupidity it’ s legendary.

414
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Just gaze into the eyes of a chicken and you’ ll
see its incredible stupidity staring back at you.

415
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Yeah! It’ s the one animal in the world
that deserves to get its throat cut.

416
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
And your mother is the queen of the chickens.

417
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Does she ever ask about me?
Where I am, things I do...

418
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Oh, yeah! She loves to talk about you because
of all the children you sent her to care for.

419
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
She curses you every day.

420
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,040
Oh, my God! What happened?

421
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Jesus Christ! Get a bucket! Go!

422
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Did you loosen that bolt?

423
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,200
All this cold with the water...
It doesn’ t make sense.

424
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Was it you? Speak up! Did
you loosen that bolt?

425
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
She doesn’ t even know what it means.

426
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
You made it!

427
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Oh, God, make this time work!

428
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Who knows what is he up to now.

429
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,080
Mom, who sings in this box?

430
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
People.

431
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
People fit?

432
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Honey, I’ll explain it to you later.
Maybe you should go to your room now.

433
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
May I watch Rapunzel?

434
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Yeah, watch Rapunzel!

435
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Music? You never listen to the music.
What is this all about?

436
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
It’s a party. Your daughter’
s gonna dance for me.

437
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
She can’t . I’ll do it!

438
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
All right. Call the little brad in here!

439
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,240
Come here and have a dance for
your father, little girl!

440
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Please! She is unwell She has a stomachache.

441
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Stop that!

442
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,000
You wanna defy me? Uh? You wanna defy me?
Get rotten there, bitch!

443
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Please, open!

444
01:09:29,683 --> 01:09:31,325
Open the door!

445
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
You don’ t have to hide.
You’ re already hidden by me.

446
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Listen to her! Your mother is such a killjoy.

447
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Open the door!

448
01:10:02,395 --> 01:10:03,570
You know what?...

449
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Please...

450
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I brought you some food and music
and a nice Christmas tree...

451
01:10:16,738 --> 01:10:19,396
because I wanted you to have some fun.

452
01:10:25,599 --> 01:10:26,701
I’ m sorry!

453
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
You and your mum, you ruined my party.
1:10:33 – 1:10:35 You made me angry.

454
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Let me get out of here!

455
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Fammi uscire da qui!

456
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
But you know what?

457
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
You and me can still have a good time.

458
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Open the door!

459
01:10:53,304 --> 01:10:54,304
Please!

460
01:10:55,518 --> 01:10:56,717
Please!

461
01:11:00,328 --> 01:11:01,399
Please!

462
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:06,137
Open this door!

463
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,248
Let me get out of here!

464
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:26,000
You see? There’ s nothing to worry about!
You’ re just making your father happy...

465
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
You bastard! Did you touch her?

466
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Honey, did he do something to you?

467
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I need an answer right now!

468
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I swear to God, if you dare to touch her, you’ll see a
different side of me, the one that you have never seen!

469
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Mum, I don’ t want to write.
What good is writing?

470
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Well, if you know how to write, you’ll be able to
read, too. Reading books is very important, sweety.

471
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,080
Outside they will judge your
intelligence with that.

472
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
But we only have one book.

473
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:04,000
It doesn’t matter. You have to be
ready for when we get out of here.

474
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:13,000
You know, I have this feeling... He hasn’ t found our coded help
note. He was just angry with me because I flooded the bathroom.

475
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Somebody will come and save us, you’ll see!
We’ re so close, sweety!

476
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,000
At school, I was taught writing
using drawings of animals.

477
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:42,000
If I need an “E”, I use an elephant and then, for
an “L”, I use a lion, for an “H”, I use a horse.

478
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,975
Go on! Write it!

479
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
No! I don’ t want to write anything.

480
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Take this pencil and write!

481
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Sarah, I said “write”!

482
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
OK. Honey, would you do
this for mummy, please?

483
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
That’ s my baby!...

484
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Where are you going, missy?

485
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
The bastard! He touched her.

486
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I remember something, it
seems like it was yesterday.

487
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:32,000
One morning, I started acting out because I didn’t want to go to school and my mum
said that it was OK if I provided to finish my homework while she went shopping.

488
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:49,000
That’ s the way it started.
Over ten years of abuse.

489
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
It was my father...

490
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Your father.

491
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I didn’t know if it was right or wrong, I
only know that I was terrified to death.

492
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I was ashamed and I was
afraid to tell anybody

493
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
In all this... I hated my mum!

494
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I hated her for all the times she left me home
in that bad wolf’ s den to live my nightmare.

495
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I hated her for all the times she looked at my strange
drawings saying “Oh, they are beautiful!” ...

496
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,000
for that time when I wrote
in my notebook “I wanna die”

497
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
“We don’ t say things like this”, she said.

498
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Stupid mum! Stupid!

499
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I don’ t want things like these
to happen to you, sweety.

500
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Mum’ s here to protect you.

501
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
You’ re not alone.

502
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:01,634
You bitch!

503
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Mum!

504
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Hey, baby! What did he do to you?

505
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
This is all my fault.

506
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Hello, ladies!

507
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:42,000
You know, when I was a little boy, my mother used to leave me at home,
all alone for weeks, sometimes months, without anything to eat...

508
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
and I didn’ t have a father to take care of
me, not like I take care of you. With love...

509
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:03,000
But the more kindness and affection I show you, the
more you take advantage of me and that hurts me!

510
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
But... I’ m gonna give you another chance!

511
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I’ m gonna leave the key to the padlock here and if
either one of you dares to touch it, you’ll burn in hell!

512
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Why are you doing all this?

513
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Why?

514
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
This is why!

515
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,000
“HELP” spelled backwards?
What do you take me for? An idiot?

516
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Have you ever wondered of why I
chose you, out of all your sisters?

517
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Because you never obey me!... You always do what you
want. Your stubbornness is why all this is happening.

518
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And you’ re teaching her to be just like you.

519
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Well, this is gonna be a test for her.

520
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Leave her alone! I’ m here all for you.

521
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I’m for you... All yours.

522
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,000
You got nothing I want, you’ re worn out.
You’ re old.

523
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Even out there, no one would even look
twice at you unless it was to pity you!

524
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Your own children don’ t even
know you exist, you’ re nothing!

525
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Before I forget, this is for you, little one!

526
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
You make sure she knows how to do it!

527
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
No, Sarah! Don’ t do it!

528
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Put the key back where you found it!

529
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Be a good girl, Sarah!

530
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
You will never see your brothers again.

531
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Take off that lipstick!

532
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Mum’s thirsty. Can you bring
me some water, please?

533
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Did you draw the line for today?

534
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Go draw the line!

535
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Mum, wake up! Please!

536
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Please, open your eyes! Mum, answer to me!

537
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Mum, why don’ t you open your eyes?

538
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Mum, don’ t leave me alone!

539
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Do you want some salt and
pepper on these stakes, sweety?

540
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Oh, yes. I’ ll get it.

541
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
This is delicious, isn’t it?

542
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Want some fresh juice, too?

543
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
This is not a juice!

544
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Yes, it is.

545
01:25:47,025 --> 01:25:48,025
No, it’ s not!

546
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
OK, I’ll drink it all.

547
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
OK, I want the fresh juice, too.

548
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Now you’ve changed your mind, isn’t it?
Got you!

549
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
So I give you a chance to improve
yourself and you unlock the chain?

550
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Now you’ ll learn your lesson, young lady!

551
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I was only gone for a week...

552
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Can’ t I enjoy a little holiday in
Thailand without all this shit?

553
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
It was a simple test! All
you had to do was pass it.

554
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
What the hell is this?

555
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I will not be disobeyed!

556
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
You know, without me you’ d be dead.

557
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Oh, you’ re not talking.
Well, that’ s a change!

558
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
You know what? You need me, I don’t need you!

559
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
He left!
Hey, sweety! Can you hear me?

560
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
You did well not to answer. You never know
what’ s best with him when he’ s around.

561
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Yes. Now what?

562
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:03,000
We’ll wait... Mum has been waiting for a
lifetime, you have to learn to do the same.

563
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Maybe it’s better for us to sleep.
Time goes by faster.

564
01:29:40,065 --> 01:29:41,065
Please!

565
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I’ m begging you, please!

566
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,000
You cannot stay here! Run! Run away!

567
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,120
I’m not the only one here...

568
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Mum, I’m cold!

569
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Yes, I know, sweety...

570
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Let’s start running around the room, OK?

571
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Do you remember how to do it?

572
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Are you doing it?

573
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:14,041
Yes.

574
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Now, let’s do some exercises, OK? One and two and
three and four. One and two and three and four.

575
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Are you doing it?

576
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Does it feel better, sweety?

577
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Does it?

578
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,200
OK. Let’s do it one more time!

579
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
God, where am I?

580
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Now we’ll do some genuflection.
Do you remember how to do it?

581
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
With the knees?

582
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
That’ s right!

583
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Oh, I’ m still freezing!

584
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
One and two and three and ...

585
01:32:53,304 --> 01:32:54,304
Hello!

586
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Hello! Is anybody there?

587
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Yes, we’ re here! Open!

588
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Who are you?

589
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I’ m Sharon. In the other bedroom
there’ s Sarah. She’ s my daughter.

590
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Do you know that man?

591
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
He’ s our father.

592
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
How long have you been here?

593
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
More than eight thousand days...

594
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Oh, God! So many years!

595
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
It’ s 24 years. Listen! Go find the
keys and open the door. Please!

596
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I don’ t know what to do,
maybe he’ll get angry.

597
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Well, you need more courage to live in here than to kill
yourself. We have to get out of here! Come on, open!

598
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Wait! I have my cell phone.

599
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
A cell phone in here!...

600
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Emergencies.

601
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Hello! My name is Cristina Rosenberg and I’ve been kidnapped
by this man and now I’ m in his house, at least I think so...

602
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:29,000
No, his daughter is here, too. I mean his
daughter and his niece... I didn’t understand.

603
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Yes, they’ve been kidnapped , too.

604
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Wait a minute! Hey, hey! What’s the address?

605
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
It’ s Franklyn Street number 2.

606
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I beg you, come as soon as possible!
He hit me several times.

607
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
The line went dead.

608
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Fuck! It’s not working anymore.

609
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Oh, c’mon! Answer!

610
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
What the hell? Don’t stop trying!

611
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Maybe I should just wait until they
call me back. They’ll find us, right?

612
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Yeah, today is our lucky day! I’m sure
this time we’ll manage to get out of here.

613
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I’ll put the silent mode on and I’ll hide
it in my purse in case he’ s coming.

614
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,520
How will you know if they’ re calling?

615
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I’ll check from time to time...

616
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Right! This way they will find us for sure...

617
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
How did you meet him?

618
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
He’s a regular at the bar I work at.

619
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Last night my car broke down

620
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
and he offered me a ride.

621
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I trusted him...

622
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
He’s well known in town...

623
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I mean, he’s a gentleman!
Talks to everyone...

624
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Are you his daughter? The one that escaped
with the religious cult?

625
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
He made me write a letter,
everybody bought it!

626
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Once at the bar he was telling us about how much he missed you
and he burst into tears, we were all trying to comfort him...

627
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Wait a second! What about me?

628
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Does that mean I will not get out of here?

629
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Tears are useful in here.
You’ d better keep an eye on your phone!

630
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Could you check and see if he brought
something to eat? We’re starving in here.

631
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Sweety, are you still with us?

632
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
I’m drawing Rapunzel.

633
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I prepared everything. Do you promise that if I open
the door you won’t run away? I’m really afraid of him.

634
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
OK, don’t worry! I will not do it.

635
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Give it also to Sarah, please!

636
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:05,000
For all these years nothing good ever happened to me. You’re a kind of a
miracle. They will find us, I’m sure about this! You need to stay strong.

637
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
How can I be strong when
he’s stronger than us?

638
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:19,000
No, not at all, he’s not stronger than us.
We need to trick him!

639
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Since you are here, we have better chances to do
so. We’ll find a solution, I’m sure about that!

640
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:37,000
All my children are waiting for me
upstairs, I need to get out of here!

641
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I just want to go back home.
My parents are waiting for me.

642
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Well, tears won’t help!

643
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Maybe it’ s like what happened in the mountains last year
when those people were missing. They never found them.

644
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Police will arrive, your family
will start looking for you!

645
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Fuck! It’s him, he’ s here!

646
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Dress up!

647
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Oh! Have you eaten?

648
01:40:27,365 --> 01:40:28,365
Yes.

649
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
You haven’t lost your appetite,
that means you’ re settling in.

650
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Now, there’s some rules you have to follow.

651
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Do not talk to the others
or give them food or water.

652
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:56,000
When I arrive, everything’ s clean and
that table is set: for lunch or dinner.

653
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I want you to look nice
for me when I come here.

654
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:23,000
You’re gonna be a role model for the others. If you
follow the rules, you and me are gonna be just fine.

655
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Hey, you have to pretend that you like it here, that you’re
getting used to it. I’ve never try that, maybe it works.

656
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
But I can’t. That’s disgusting!

657
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,320
Listen to me! Do you want to
see your family again or not?

658
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I’m sure my mum is worrying about me.

659
01:41:58,001 --> 01:42:03,000
Don’ t get things impossible!
You have to earn his trust.

660
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Maybe he will take you out with him once in a while. This
way you will save yourself, you will save all of us!

661
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
There’s no call.

662
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Go get ready, be nice to him... Don’ t cry, he doesn’t
like to see you crying. He could arrive at any moment, OK?

663
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
God knows what will happen to me.

664
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
There you go! This is
what I was talking about.

665
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I’m home!

666
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Are you ready for me?

667
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Did you primp for me?

668
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:55,000
What a smart girl! C’mon!
My time is precious.

669
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,000
You’ re good at that! Tell
me you can cook, too.

670
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Yes.

671
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Well, I found myself a very nice young woman and
she found herself the best man in the world.

672
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Unfortunately not everybody
here appreciates me.

673
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:15,000
You know what? I’m gonna go get us some food and
then we’ re gonna have a nice dinner together. OK?

674
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Of course.

675
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Didn’t you have a purse when you came here?

676
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
You did, I remember.

677
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Yes, sure...

678
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Here it is!

679
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
You called the police?

680
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Well, you can’t trust anybody!

681
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
You shouldn’t have fucked
with me, little girl!

682
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:20,000
This is your fault! If the police come by,
I’m gonna put you in a bag! You bitch!

683
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Honey, are you OK?

684
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,160
Shall I draw the line, mummy?

685
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Yeah, draw the line!

686
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I have to pee.

687
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
There’s not much choice, do it in a corner!

688
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Sooner or later he will
decide to open the doors.

689
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Better sleep and not to think about it.

690
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Hey, what are you?

691
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Are you hungry?

692
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Honey, are you ok?

693
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
It hurts, mummy!

694
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,022
What does it hurt, sweety?

695
01:49:43,190 --> 01:49:43,975
Everywhere.

696
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Can you tell me what happened?

697
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
I don’t know. Somebody hurt me.

698
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:56,000
There’s nobody inside here, sweety!
Try to stay calm, OK?

699
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Don’t be scared! Mum will come and get you!

700
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Listen, sweety, it’s your favorite!

701
01:50:26,688 --> 01:50:27,688
Sarah!

702
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Damn it, Sarah! Can you hear me?

703
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Oh, my God! She doesn’t answer.

704
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
OK, calm down! Maybe she just felt asleep...

705
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Sarah, can you hear mummy?

706
01:51:05,003 --> 01:51:06,003
Can you hear me?

707
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Oh, baby, you’ re here!

708
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
This is a rat.

709
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:43,000
He’s been here.
I wanted to play with him.

710
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Sarah ...

711
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Honey, can you hear me?

712
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Answer to mummy, please!

713
01:52:43,616 --> 01:52:51,616
- Open the door!
- Jesus!

714
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Damn it! What in...

715
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I swear to God, this time I’ll end it! My
baby’s sick. If you don’t help us, I’ll do it!

716
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
She’s not breathing!

717
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
She is.

718
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Wake up, girl!

719
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
She doesn’t answer. Do something!

720
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Like what?

721
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Take her... and leave her... at the hospital!

722
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Don’t be stupid! I’ll get some medicines.

723
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,000
If she dies, I’ll have no
reason to live anymore.

724
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Be strong, sweety!

725
01:54:18,722 --> 01:54:19,805
No notes!

726
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Please, at least she’ll remember our games.
I’ll never see her again.

727
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Show me!

728
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,615
- It’s childish drawings, it’s nothing.
- Fine!

729
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
You... You stay right here!

730
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Hey, Buck! C’mon!

731
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I expect you inside, let’s go!

732
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Oh, no! I had to bring my
wife at the hospital...

733
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
John, no...
OK, five minutes!

734
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
You’ re going but you can’t hide! OK?

735
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Get me the police right away!

736
01:55:50,257 --> 01:55:51,355
Of course, doctor Holly!

737
01:55:52,184 --> 01:55:56,000
Unbelievable!
I’ ve never seen anything like this before.

738
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Hey, little lady!

739
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
You can make a sign if
you hear me, anything...

740
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Detective! She’s in a very bad state of malnutrition. She was bitten by a rat, she
has a serious infection which is not good because of her metabolic unbalance.

741
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Sooner or later she would have come to this.

742
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:27,000
We’ve searched all the medical records, she has never been here before but somebody,
maybe has the same genetic data and it’s something that we can look into.

743
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:33,000
No, we didn’t find anything. No match!

744
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:41,000
The only thing we found was this! She had it in her
pocket. Maybe it’ll be useful in your investigation.

745
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Kids drawings.

746
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I know somebody who can interpret this so I’ll get it to
him. Meanwhile, I’m gonna be here, she might wake up.

747
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:00,000
OK. Detective, even though it’s a dangerous
situation, we must remain hopeful.

748
01:57:01,536 --> 01:57:02,536
Thank you!

749
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Before I forget... She was sexually abused, not
recently so we don’ t have important proof.

750
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Hi, doc! I got these kid’ s pictures
I need you to interpret so ...

751
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Yes. So, I’m gonna take a photo, I’m gonna send
it to you and you get back to me right away.

752
01:57:50,336 --> 01:57:51,336
Right!

753
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Look at you!

754
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:18,000
You’ re not going anywhere, you’ re
safe here! I’ m not gonna let you down.

755
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:28,000
And the bastard that did this to you,
he’s gonna get what he deserves.

756
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Tell me something good!

757
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:50,000
So you looked to the drawings and...

758
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Thanks! OK. Yeah, bye!

759
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Any news, detective?

760
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:06,000
They say probably an adult did the drawings and not her. It’s
like when this big black cloud right now and my instinct says...

761
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Somebody come, please! She woke up!

762
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
OK, girlie! What’s your name?

763
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Mum!

764
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
What’s your mummy’s name? Look!

765
01:59:27,869 --> 01:59:28,869
Mum!

766
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Stay strong, sweetheart!

767
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
What’s this mean here?

768
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:47,000
“H” like horse, “E” like elephant...

769
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
"H" ...

770
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
"E"

771
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:01,000
One, two, three, four, five...

772
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
“HELP”

773
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Ten, eleven ...

774
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
“TWO FRANKLYN STREET”

775
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,160
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen...

776
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
It’ s a code! It’ a code!

777
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
We’ve lost her!

778
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Get a squad car to Two, Franklyn Street! Now!

779
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:06,168
JOSEPH FRITZL RECEIVED A LIFE SENTENCE AND HE IS
