using our frequency.

19
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:52,791
Do you copy?

20
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,110
[Police Officer]Are you kidding?

21
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:56,554
[Police Officer] Well

[Police Officer] Yo, unit

00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,458
I copy your complaint.

24
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,305
Now if you get a vagrant
wandering onto our

25
00:01:02,332 --> 00:01:04,291
show, can you probably
inform him that this is

26
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,791
police frequency.

27
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,625
[Joe] This is Marlboro Man.

28
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,031
I don't know who you are boy...

29
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:11,875
[Police Officer]Bugsy,
did you hear that?

30
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:12,666
He called you boy.

31
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,000
[Police Officer] I heard

32
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:14,999
Thank you very much.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
[Police Officer]Who

34
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:16,999
I want your call letters now!

35
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,003
This is some official
police radio frequency, now

36
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,613
you got two seconds to get off.

37
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,356
[Joe] Best lookin'
girl I ever knew

38
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:27,815
couldn't get me off that fast.

39
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:30,541
[Police Officer]

40
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,148

mister, all right?

41
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:33,356
This is a felony, now terminate
your transmission now!

42
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:35,791
[Police Officer] I'm sure
that really scared him.

43
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:39,041
[Police Officer]I believe it did.

44
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,416
[Police Officer] Look, you're
violating the law.

45
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,783
Mr. Marlboro Man, last chance.

46
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,810

47
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,458

52
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,250
Get off punk!

53
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,736
Punk, punk, punk, punk. (Echoing)

(electric guitar squealing)

62
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:03,458

63
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,999
(music building)

64
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:16,041
No!

65
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:18,166
(camera flash)

66
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,999
[Joe] Run like that,

67
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,708
[Criminal] Move, move!

68
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,166

69
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,166

(breathing heavy)

72
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:31,625
Wait, wait, so anyway
he pulls this up

73
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,333
and says, "Shrimp."

74
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,998
Just like this he goes...

75
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,999
[Police Dispatcher]Unit
eight, your

76
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,583
suspect is entering
the parking lot.

77
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,666
Hey, hey, hey...

78
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,500
(menacing music)

79
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,083
[Joe] I wanna talk to you.

80
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,250
Give it up, give it up!

81
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,999
Oh, this guy's gonna
fuckin' bust him.

82
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:52,999
What's in his hand?

83
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,998
Ahh! Gimme the
keys mother fucker!

84
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:57,166
I'm not gonna keep talkin' it,

85
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,708
get your hands off of 'em.

86
00:03:58,875 --> 00:03:59,999
You!

87
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,291
I'm gonna drop you!

88
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,083
(gun blasts)

89
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,291
(tires squealing)

90
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,833
(gun blasts)

91
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,333
(explosive boom)

92
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,833
Whoa!

93
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:14,999
No way!

94
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,083
(explosive boom)

95
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,500
Well... (mumbling)

96
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,083
(fire crackling)

97
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:30,833
Can't believe it!

98
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:32,399
Excuse me, Marlboro
Man, nice job.

99
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:33,999
Who the hell are you guys?

100
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,125
We're vice.

101
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:35,999
Yeah, Video Vice.

102
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,666
(fire crackling)

103
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,666
Video Vice?

104
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,153
Well for a minute there I thought

105
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,999
you were real cops.

106
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,208
Hey, do you know how
you tell a real cop?

107
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,735
A real cop doesn't blow his cover.

108
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:46,095
(sirens wailing)

109
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,208
What the hell you looking at?

110
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,333
Not much.

111
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,083
You'd look a lot
abetter with a smile

112
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,791
on your face and your hair down.

113
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,166
Kids.

114
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,583
(helicopter blades spinning)

115
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,458
(sirens wailing)

116
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,916
(water hissing)

117
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:11,999
(sirens wailing)

118
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:32,999
Huh, hundred dollar
bill, nice touch.

119
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,625
What you see and what you hear

120
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,250
in this room is confidential,

121
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,291
strictly not for public release.

122
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,666
This is what I wanna
talk to you about.

123
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,208
This is what we're up
against, a serial killer.

124
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:49,000
(gun blast)

125
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,333
We have no motive, only method.

126
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,708
We have no suspects, only
a few suspicions.

127
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,666
And they are Chief?

128
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,313
The killer is
probably a prostitute.

129
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,000
She has sex with her victim
then she kills them.

130
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:05,375
As to motive, it could be
any number of reasons.

131
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:09,083
The psych department has
come up with several.

132
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,458
So we have an unhappy hooker.

133
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,999
Oh, and she wears a red wig.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,999
It's stone-cold dead after that.

135
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,958
Okay, so what you're saying is...

136
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:21,199
What I'm saying is that your
team has done a good job.

137
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:25,458
What you need is some help
now, so we're gonna get you that.

138
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,625
Look, wait, we don't
need any help, we're fine.

139
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:32,333
Heather, Heather, send in
Joe if you would please.

140
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,221
Best man in homicide.(saloon
piano jingle)

141
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,750
Oh, Lord, this guy?

142
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,999
God almighty.

143
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:46,999
Oh my God, oh Lord, TJ Hooker.

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,541
You know each other?

145
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,458
[Andrea] Well...

146
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,185
I don't know what
game you're playing,

147
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,231
but you better be able to
work with one another.

148
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:00,791
Well I don't wanna
work with these guys,

149
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,166
they're a bunch of pups.

150
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,416
Hey Joe, we didn't ask for you.

151
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,291
Chief, we can do this
on our own, really.

152
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,333
[Bugs] Yeah, I
second that, Chief.

153
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,208
He doesn't exactly...

154
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,695
Hey, hey, hey, hey why don't
you watch your language man.

155
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:14,223
Oh, we homeboys now?

156
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,458
I don't like your language.

157
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,465
I don't like your
clothes, so now we're even.

158
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:19,999
That's clever.

159
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,708
What are you looking at?

160
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,999
You, I'm staring at you.

161
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:27,208
A woman is the worst mistake

162
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,000
in the history o flaw enforcement.

163
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,041
Well look at that, he's not
only rude, he's a caveman.

164
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:36,999
Well even a caveman knows a woman

165
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,666
can't do a man's job.

166
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,208
No, come on.

167
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,583
Yeah right.

168
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,750
Come on.

169
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,833
(scoffs)

170
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,666
Ouch!

171
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,166
What does that prove?

172
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,133
Well that's my point, honey,
that's my point.

173
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Well, I'm glad we're all friends.

174
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,999
(laughing)

175
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:08,000
Cute little stunt you
pulled in there partner.

176
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,625
Well, partner, you gotta
lay down the ground rules,

177
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,250
let 'em know who's in charge.

178
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,999
They like that.

179
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,645
Maybe you shouldn't
be quite so hard.

180
00:08:16,672 --> 00:08:18,375
Well, maybe.

181
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,461
It's one thing to videotape
hookers, it's another

182
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:22,308
thing to track down
killers, you know that.

183
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,666
These young nimrods, they
hesitate one second

184
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,998
and the city of Vegas
doesn't have to worry about

185
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:28,999
paying my pension.

186
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,291
They're fully aware, Joe.

187
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,858
I could be wrong, I
could be wrong.

188
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:35,093
Look at me, 20 years
in-grade, and you,

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,998
you partner up with
me for a few years,

190
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,875
and you just climb on
up that latter Chief.

191
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,666
They don't always promote
the best cops, Joe,

192
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,375
they promote the
best administrators.

193
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,041
It's a dubious distinction at best.

194
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,666
Dubious?

195
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,458
(laughing)

196
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,250
Yeah.

197
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,166
We had our days, didn't we?

198
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,999
Oh God yeah, yeah.

199
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,958
Life goes on though.

200
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,375
Yeah it does.

201
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,166
Yes sir, Chief.

202
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:10,208
(suspenseful music)

203
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,166
(telephone ringing)

204
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,041
(toilet flushing)

205
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,166
(telephone ringing)

206
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,813
Hello, yeah okay, okay,
thanks a lot.

207
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,291
That's the front
desk, she's on her way.

208
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,500
This is it.

209
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,786
Joe, I need you to adjust
the camera on your buckle.

210
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:34,500
On your buckle, that's
it, that's it.

211
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,791
That's good.

212
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,918
Just talked to the bell
captain, ho is on the way.

213
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,486
All right, woow!

214
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,588
Damn girl, what were you
doing in that bathroom?

215
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:46,999
(door knocks)

216
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,000
Just a second.

217
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,875
(menacing jingle)

218
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,208
(door knocks)

219
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,575
All right, well wait a minute.

220
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,208
What am I doin'?

221
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,083
(door knocks)

222
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,291
Coming.

223
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,875
Hi.

224
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:07,666
Hi sweetie.

225
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:08,833
Come on in.

226
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:13,041
You're kinda young,
how old are you?

227
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,750
How old do you want me to be?

228
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,125
Old enough, I guess.

229
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,583
Can I use your bathroom?

230
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,750
Sure, it's back there.

231
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:27,708
Get ready Joe.

232
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,999
[Prostitute] What was that?

233
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,045
I said, we're gonna have
a real good time baby.

234
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:40,041
Well, you get what
you pay for sweetie.

235
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,983
So, what'll it be,
around the world?

236
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:47,958
Normal.

237
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:50,079
A traditionalist, I'm an
old fashioned girl myself.

238
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:52,708
That'll be a $100 bucks.

239
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,333
Is that negotiable?

240
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,580
No, but it is in advance.

241
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,291
[Joe] Here's a little extra.

242
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,541
I think that's it, shall we go?

243
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,999
No, no, no.- No, no, no.

244
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,403
Let him cook for a little while.

245
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,083
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,041
[Mike] It's good.

247
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:06,999
[Bugs] Uh huh.

248
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,400
Boy she must of been out of lotion.

249
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:09,500
[Mike] She looks angry.

250
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,166
(laughing)

251
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,875
He looks a little
angry, doesn't he?

252
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:15,041
(laughing)

253
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,808
Fun's over, come on,
come on, let's go.

254
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:17,835
Okay.

255
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:19,833
Oh man.

256
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:21,166
Vegas Vice, you are under
arrest for prostitution.

257
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,166
Where in the hell you guys been?

258
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,453
I can't take another bust.

259
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,999
Joe, it's just a...

260
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:26,999
What, what do you have to say?

261
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,208
I mean, we figured
you have a little time

262
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,000
to skeet the ball.

263
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:29,999
Oh yeah?

264
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:30,833
Excuse me?

265
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:31,625
No, excuse me.

266
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,416
Take another bust...

267
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,416
I don't give a rat's ass...

268
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,583
(glass smashing)

269
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,125
Ugh!

270
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,333
Bitch jumped out the window.

271
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,166
Ahh! (Grunt)

272
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,075
Bitch jumped our the window!

273
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,999
Ugh!

274
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,083
(tires squealing)

275
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,000
(engine revving)

276
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:05,889
(electric guitar jingle)

277
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,708
(tires squealing)

278
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,999
(car horns blasting)

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,583
(heavy breathing)

280
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:29,291
(laughing)

281
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:36,500
(saloon piano melody)

282
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,791
That is not the most
professional display

283
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:38,708
of police work I have ever seen.

284
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,835
Actually Chief, I think
the sound and the camera

285
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:43,583
work is like, you know
with, and the camera is like...

286
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,291
(fist smacking)

287
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,258
Yeah, it was actually... It
was real... Oh...

288
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:49,285
Yeah, it looked nice.

289
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,500
You had a few problems.

290
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,333
Oh, we had a few
problems all right,

291
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,998
right here with these girl scouts.

292
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:58,291
Another feminine
reference, how nice.

293
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,416
All we did was let
Joe sit in there

294
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,791
and cook a little too
long with the suspect.

295
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,000
It's no big deal, Joe.

296
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,246
You know, it's just like an
initiation into the club.

297
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,708
[Joe] It's a bunch of crap.

298
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,333
Damn it was just a joke.

299
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,625
It was just a joke, damn.

300
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,998
You think putting two
people in the hospital,

301
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,159
costing the city thousands
of dollars worth of property

302
00:13:20,186 --> 00:13:22,125
damage is funny?

303
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,731
Well it ain't funny, it
ain't a joke.

304
00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:25,314
Look at me punk, I'm
talkin' to you.

305
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:26,375
I ain't laughin'.

306
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,375
There's nobody laughing here.

307
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,916
You know what?

308
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,291
We don't need a babysitter, okay,
and you're too loud.

309
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,583
Would you like some
bread to go with all that

310
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,458
whine you...

311
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,750
Chief, maybe somebody
with a sense of humor

312
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,333
might be...

313
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,250
Look, this is like ridiculous!

314
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,816
There's no reason
why we can't do...

315
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:42,343
Hey, hey, confine your jokes
to your men on your own time.

316
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,137
[Bugs] Can't take a
joke.- Take a joke.

317
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,999
It's hot in here, turn
on the air conditioning.

318
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,333
Chief, your appointment's here.

319
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,666
Oh, oh.

320
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,978
Oh, and Mike, your
girlfriend called,

321
00:13:57,005 --> 00:13:59,458
test results were negative.

322
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,041
Could you please do me a favor,

323
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,848
can you just put this
stuff in my mailbox?

324
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,750
Is that all right?

325
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,276
I'm not your personal secretary.

326
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:08,797
And, oh, the surf
shop called from LA,

327
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:10,083
your board is ready.

328
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,999
Thank you.

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,999
What is Sex Wax anyway?

330
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,320
It's something that you're
never gonna know about, please

331
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:16,973
just run away, please.

332
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,708
(door creaking shut)

333
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,999
Come on Bardog,
right for the top.

334
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,843
Hey, Jake, watch
out, Joe's getting serious.

335
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,375
He's putting on the side boards.

336
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,916
It's illegal inmost
states, you know?

337
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:33,125
[Barney] Put it
on the side boards.

338
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,291
[Group] Ahh!

339
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,750
Woo!

340
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,458
Ahh, damn freakin' rookies!

341
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,998
Hey, give it up will ya?

342
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,919
Are you still pissed off
about that vice thing?

343
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:46,999
Hey the chief likes the
numbers, pandering and prostitution

344
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:50,041
are both down.

345
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,448
And a vice for your advice...

346
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:52,541
Vice-ke-teers!

347
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,208
My God, what the
hell you know about

348
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,625
the streets anyway, huh?

349
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,631
You're still pencils and
pushing the buttons...

350
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:59,541
What do I know about the streets?

351
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,708
Hey, if you don't...

352
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,375
On the computer...

353
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,261
You and I and Barney
invented the streets.

354
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:05,458
Jake.

355
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,625
(laughing)

356
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,500
You remember my rookie year?

357
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,041
(laughing)

358
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,166
Hey, what is it, something
I don't know about?

359
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,041
(laughing)

360
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,458
Come on, what is it?

361
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,791
Me and Joe, me and Joe are
out on the streets, right?

362
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,375
Now, I'd been on the
job, what, about a week,

363
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,999
and he's been on about a
year, so that makes him

364
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,500
the veteran and makes
me the rookie.

365
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,500
Which means I gotta do
everything he says,

366
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,708
so we bust this hustler
down on the strip.

367
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,998
So he tells me, he tells
me I gotta pat her down

368
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:39,000
'cause she might be packing a rod.

369
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,375
[Bartender] Pat her down?

370
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,875
Yeah, well that's something
we used to have to do.

371
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:43,750
(laughing)

372
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,476
So I'm like kinda
trying to, you know...

373
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:47,999
Trying to feel this poor girl up.

374
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,291
(laughing)

375
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,041
[Bartender] Hey, come on
will ya, what happened?

376
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,998
All right, all right, all
right, so I get my hands

377
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:56,079
around her front, I'm kinda
like hesitating, and he's

378
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:58,453
going, "Come on, come on, come
on, you gotta do it",

379
00:15:58,454 --> 00:15:59,791
"you gotta do it."

380
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:00,958
[Bartender] Yeah so?

381
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:01,833
So I reached down in front,

382
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,500
and she's packing a rod all right.

383
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,541
I'm shaking hands with the
biggest salami on the strip.

384
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,958
(laughing)

385
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:12,239
That son of a bitch has got
me feeling up a transvestite.

386
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:15,833
(laughing)

387
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:17,416
[Bartender] Man, Jesus.

388
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,823
And then, and then she
says, "You can bust me anytime."

389
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,500
(laughing)

390
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,791
Let's get the hell
out of here man.

391
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,998
Hey, gimme the keys.

392
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:34,279
No, I ain't giving you the keys.

393
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:34,999
Gimme the keys.

394
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:35,916
You got the keys.

395
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:36,833
No, no, no, you got the keys.

396
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:37,750
Here, here, here's the keys.

397
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,436
Here, Bardog's got the keys!
(laughing)

398
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:41,998
Come on, let's go. (Laughing)

399
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,875
Come on, big guy.

400
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,291
Oops. (Laughing)

401
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,833
(suspenseful music)

402
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,625
(coins jingling)

403
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,791
(upbeat music)

404
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:24,875
I'd like to propose a
toast to a big bust.

405
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:27,375
Yes.

406
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,666
Oh, I'm not drinking
to that bastard, uh-huh.

407
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,998
Oh, no, no, no, not
that bust, I'm talking

408
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,416
about the bust over there in black.

409
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,125
Ho! Drink 'em up!

410
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,958
You dick!

411
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:35,999
Vice-ke-Teers!

412
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,666
Bugs! Who-ah!

413
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,416
Love you Joe.

414
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,183
Hey man, how'd ya
get a name like Bugs?

415
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,570
Barney, Barney, I never heard a
president named Bugs before.

416
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,650
You think that's racist, don't you?

417
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:55,125
It's not racist, it's a
joke, and you guys...

418
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,125
Barney, they know about jokes.

419
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,583
You know about jokes, don't you?

420
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,150
But I love you guys, I do, no I do.

421
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,708
I love you.

422
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,104
I love the
vice-ke-teers, vice-ke-teers,

423
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:06,484
vice-ke-teers.

424
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,998
We love you too Joe.

425
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,833
I especially love you.

426
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:10,083
I mean that.

427
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:10,999
Joe, Joe, Joe.

428
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,750
Joe.

429
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:13,541
Mike, Mike, Mike.

430
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,791
Why don't you go get
yourself a cup of coffee?

431
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:16,958
Joe, Joe, Joe

432
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,466
why don't you go get
yourself a cup of coffee?

433
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,998
It ain't gotta be
like that brother,

434
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,319
No, you ain't got to do all that.

435
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:24,998
We don't need to fight, we're
gonna go to another place.

436
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:27,625
[Bugs] Come on Joe.

437
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,998
[Mike] Just split.

438
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:30,839
[Bugs] Joe, let's get
out of here man, come on.

439
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:32,845
Okay, she loves you too
Joe, it's cool brother.

440
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:33,999
It's cool.

441
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:34,999
Okay, I'll let you go now.

442
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,320
Barney we're going to go to
a place a little more mature.

443
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:41,011
[Barney] Good atmosphere.

444
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,080
Love you bro.

445
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:43,999
Love you too bro.

446
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:44,999
Washington baby!

447
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,999
I love you too Joe.

448
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,458
[Barney] Let's go.

449
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,999
(rushing water)

450
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:56,541
(suspenseful music)

451
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:04,208
[Prostitute] I see you still
have your bad habits Fred.

452
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:08,333
[Fred] Yes, I'm still smoking.

453
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,020
I'm still having
problems with my wife.

454
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:13,291
[Prostitute] Really, well
I think we can

455
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,999
take care of a few
of those worries.

456
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,666
[Fred] Well I sure hope so.

457
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,416
(suspenseful music)

458
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:36,125
(skin slapping)

459
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,333
(gun fire)

460
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,999
(horn honking)

461
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,125
(door knocks)

462
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,458
Housekeeping!

463
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,708
(speaks in foreign language)

464
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,333
(screams)

465
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:02,041
(country music heard
from a distance)

466
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,050
It's just like the
others Joe, gunshot wound

467
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:09,999
consistent with the gun.

468
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,750
Same bullet markings?

469
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,076
Mm-Hmm. Size and depth of
the wound matches the others.

470
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,999
Bullet right between
Alexander Hamilton's eyes.

471
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,958
Anything further
on the drug test?

472
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:22,083
Ah, I did see something.

473
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,958
Let me see.

474
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,999
Well toxicology shows
indications of stress

475
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,245
to the heart muscle, which
could indicate cocaine use.

476
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,291
Cocaine?

477
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,178
And alcohol, all of
the victims had higher

478
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:35,625
than normal blood levels.

479
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,333
Joe, you want some more coffee?

480
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,220
Yeah, leave the whole
pot right there bro.

481
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:41,998
Thanks bro.

482
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,199
Another one of these please.

483
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,128
You gotta drink that
this early in the morning?

484
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:49,541
I'm on my way to look at a body

485
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,148
that's been in a
river for two weeks.

486
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:52,999
I need encouragement.

487
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,998
Okay, I see. (Chuckles)

488
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:58,208
All right, so what you're saying is

489
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,775
that she meets the victim at a bar.

490
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:01,382
They get high
together, they get laid,

491
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:02,998
and the John gets whacked?

492
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:04,958
That's about it.

493
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,958
Do you think possibly
that this could be

494
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,916
some kind of homosexual crime?

495
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:10,958
Do you think our
murderer could be a man?

496
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:13,125
Well, there have
been similar cases,

497
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,791
but there's nothing
here in these reports

498
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,999
to indicate any anal penetration.

499
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,998
I did see something, there's
definitely

500
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:22,159
been a woman's secretion on
each of the victim' organs.

501
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:25,916
Now there's a chance we
could run a DNA test

502
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:27,999
and try and link your
suspect to the murders,

503
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,999
but it's a real long-shot.

504
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,600
The samples we got are
very contaminated.

505
00:21:31,627 --> 00:21:34,000
So what you're
basically saying is

506
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,046
that our lady friend here
straddles the victims,

507
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,129
nothing kinky, just
good ol' fashioned sex,

508
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:39,998
and that's all there is to it?

509
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,708
There's nothing to the contrary.

510
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,541
Well I don't get it then.

511
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,228
I mean, there's no
evidence of robbery.

512
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:48,958
Our hooker does her
job, she gets paid.

513
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:50,998
She takes the $100the
John gives her,

514
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:52,998
uses it as target practice.

515
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:55,239
All we have are a couple of
red hairs connected to a wig.

516
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:57,208
It doesn't make any sense.

517
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,999
Nothing makes sense.

518
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,365
Haven't you ever watched the
freaks on Oprah and Donahue?

519
00:22:02,392 --> 00:22:04,833
Yeah, yeah.

520
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,541
They're all suspects, right?

521
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,958
You got it.

522
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:09,458
I'll let you know if we get lucky.

523
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,166
Thanks Tom.

524
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:16,750
Oh Tom, whatever happened to
that Pussycat Lounge case?

525
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:20,083
That case was solved.

526
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,810
These guys you're
working with are good.

527
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,791
(slow piano melody)

528
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,416
Yeah.

529
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,291
(footsteps)

530
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:36,333
Okay, all right, all
right, how many cops

531
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,980
does it take to screw
in a light bulb?

532
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:39,958
Come on with it.

533
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:41,000
It takes two, okay, you
got one to screw

534
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,726
in the light bulb, and
you got the other

535
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:44,212
one to hold the donuts. (Laughing)

536
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,239
(clapping)

537
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,083
Oh, good, I got one, wait.

538
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,330
What do you do with an
elephant that has three balls?

539
00:22:48,357 --> 00:22:49,708
(laughing)

540
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,333
(We give up.- [Bugs) We give Up.

541
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,980
You walk 'em and
pitch to the rhino.

542
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:54,250
(laughing)

543
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,625
Oh God, that sucked.

544
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,583
Oh, come on! (Laughing)

545
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,958
I'll pitch to the rhino.

546
00:22:57,999 --> 00:22:59,999
That's one of the
four home-run balls

547
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,925
that Mays hit in Milwaukee
back in '61 or '62.

548
00:23:01,952 --> 00:23:04,666
It means a lot to me, and
I want you to have it.

549
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,083
(mellow guitar jingle)

550
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,916
I can't take this Joe.

551
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:12,999
You take it, take it.

552
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,500
You serious?

553
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:16,666
[Joe] Yeah.

554
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:18,708
Cool, thanks.

555
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,675
Look guys, I was way
out of line last night.

556
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,791
Are you saying you're sorry?

557
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:35,583
Yeah.

558
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,500
I'm sorry.

559
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,666
(crinkling plastic)

560
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:47,166
Gee, nothing for me?

561
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,999
Is this a black thing Joe?

562
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,125
(laughing)

563
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,500
Number four Bugsy, I'm
gonna need your brain.

564
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:56,166
Now, what we got here?

565
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:00,166
Well, we got four dead Johns.

566
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,999
We can all count Mike.

567
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,666
Any supplemental Joe?

568
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,673
Well, she pulled this
guy out of a hotel bar.

569
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,913
The bartender gave us a
little bit better description

570
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,839
of her, but he couldn't
ID her from our book.

571
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,999
[Andrea] She hooked
'em all in hotel bars?

572
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,291
That's right.

573
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,458
Tell me we're going about
this thing the wrong way.

574
00:24:15,485 --> 00:24:16,708
(phone ringing)

575
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,041
Yeah, vice.

576
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,625
It's yours Joe.

577
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,000
Let me see that.

578
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,166
Owens.

579
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,625
Yeah, I said, yeah.

580
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:33,291
I got a dinner date.

581
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:37,791
Scary thought.

582
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,041
Very scary.

583
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,416
(laughing)

584
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,791
(suspenseful music)

585
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:17,791
(door sliding shut)

586
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:24,625
(soft piano music)

587
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:29,101
Hey Sally, cup of
coffee black, honey.

588
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,416
Thanks sweetheart.

589
00:25:36,972 --> 00:25:37,972
Hey what do ya got there champ?

590
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:39,000
I got my new ball man.

591
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,166
[Barney] Let me see it.

592
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:40,999
Check it out.

593
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,708
It looks like the
ball Willie Mays hit

594
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,555
for his fourth home run
against the Braves,

595
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:45,625
what, '61-'62?

596
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,951
Wait a second, wait a
second, you've seen this before?

597
00:25:47,978 --> 00:25:49,625
See it?

598
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:51,831
I got one at home man, everybody
in homicide has one.

599
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:53,750
- Oh, okay...
- Get out of here.

600
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:55,083
See no, wait a second, you
know, I told you that.

601
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,000
You know something, Joe said...

602
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,208
Yeah, but he doesn't
even own a mitt,

603
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:58,458
never played a ballgame
in his life, right?

604
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,998
Hey, let me tell you something
about Joe man, all right?

605
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:01,083
[Mike] All right.

606
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,410
Joe's idle was Willie Mays.

607
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:05,000
Joe knew more about Mays than
Mays knew about himself.

608
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:09,333
And when Joe went up to spring
training with the Giants

609
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,875
when he was a rookie, he
got to play against Mays

610
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:13,999
in the spring training game.

611
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,083
What?

612
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,048
Yeah, and he fanned
Mays four times that day.

613
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,999
Anyway, he gets Mays
to a three-two count,

614
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,583
and I mean he just rears
back with everything he has,

615
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,875
and he grooves that ball
right down the middle.

616
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:27,541
He struck him out?

617
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:29,628
No, man, Mays hit the
ball out of the ballpark.

618
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,500
I mean, that ball... That's
flying still.

619
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,583
They're still looking
for that ball.

620
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,000
You can put a stewardess on
that ball he hit it so far.

621
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,333
Yeah, and you know what
though, the neat thing was,

622
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
is when Mays was rounding
the back, he stops

623
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,750
at third, he looks Joe
right in the eyes,

624
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:44,041
tips his cap as if
to say, thanks kid.

625
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:47,375
I know you could have fanned me.

626
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:50,000
So what, I mean, later on,
what happened with Joe?

627
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,998
Well, Joe had a temper.

628
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:54,875
Hello.- Hello.

629
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:56,750
Yeah dude's got a temper.

630
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,166
Hey, you know what, Joe's a
good man, and he's a good cop.

631
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,958
Welcome to the Big Leagues kid.

632
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,333
Arizona Charlies, best
place in town.

633
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,958
I'm the designated drinker tonight.

634
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:12,833
So you still the Ram man?

635
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,041
I am the number one fan.

636
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,625
You have my condolences.

637
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:20,791
They never should of
gotten rid of Dickerson.

638
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:23,416
Oh, like it would've
made a difference.

639
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:26,791
So you stayin' clean?

640
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:28,999
[Cab Driver] Sure man.

641
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,359
[Joe] So what do you got for me?

642
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,526
I got the friend, this
girl, and she's workin'

643
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:37,999
the streets.

644
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:40,719
She used to work for an
agency, one of those

645
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:43,121
part-time places.

646
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:46,208
You know, the kind you call
when you want a secretary.

647
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:49,125
What's the name of the agency?

648
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,416
Bon Temp.

649
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:53,998
Anyway, you call them, and
they send you a hooker.

650
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:58,958
It's like for high-rollers only.

651
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:01,083
It's a sleezy little
joint, and the broads

652
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,625
make a lot of money.

653
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:06,458
They're gorgeous too, man.

654
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,708
The only thing is, you
work for them,

655
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,916
they catch you using
drugs, forget it.

656
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:13,291
You're right back
out on the street.

657
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,291
That's what happened
to your friend?

658
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:16,791
Yeah.

659
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,423
Then she was telling me
about these killings...

660
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,916
What killings?

661
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,879
You know, the guys that
are getting bumped off

662
00:28:23,906 --> 00:28:25,531
by the prostitutes.

663
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,551
Hey man, we're not stupid
out here, you know?

664
00:28:28,578 --> 00:28:31,416
Go on.

665
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,383
All these guys were
going to the same agency

666
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,125
for their kicks.

667
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,999
Johnny, you holding
something from me?

668
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,083
The thing about it is, they
keep records on everything.

669
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:45,041
Good.

670
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:48,083
(mellow jingle)

671
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:56,625
Come on you guys, I've
got an early day tomorrow.

672
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:59,333
I have to be back
here in six hours.

673
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,999
Okay, Eleanor,
I'll tell you what,

674
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,123
give me just five minutes.

675
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:05,291
Yes.

676
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,458
What's a matter, no whores
on the street tonight?

677
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:08,999
[Bugs] We love you baby.

678
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,640
[Mike] You're getting
a little dramatic.

679
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,350
You know, he should
have showed by now.

680
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,544
He'll show.

681
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,771
Whether we like it
or not, he'll show.

682
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:18,999
You know something Bugs, I
don't get the man.

683
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:21,583
He's a career cop, Mike.

684
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,791
Well come on man, we're
both career cops too,

685
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:26,041
I mean, that's a
little scary isn't it?

686
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,125
Maybe he's a little
rough around the edges,

687
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,750
but he's not that bad.

688
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,291
Yeah. (Hands slapping)

689
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,125
What's up guys?

690
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:32,999
Hey, Joe, what's up?

691
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,083
We got a hooker and gaming
operation underground,

692
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,999
and they keep some very
interesting records,

693
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,166
and we gotta move fast.

694
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,375
So how fast we talkin'?

695
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:41,916
Well we don't have time
for proper channels,

696
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:42,999
we gotta move right now.

697
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:45,041
Piece a cake, we stake
it out and we'll bust her.

698
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:47,041
Let's do it.

699
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:47,999
I'm telling you right now

700
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,445
that Andrea's not gonna dig this.

701
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:50,472
Let's go.

702
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:51,958
(suspenseful music)

703
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,250
(muffled speaking
from police radio)

704
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:12,875
Don't you think we should
have told Bronski about this?

705
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:16,500
Yeah.

706
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:18,625
Bugsy, you in place over there?

707
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,125
Copy.

708
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,319
You got that back door covered?

709
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:29,625
Covered.

710
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:32,056
[Joe] You give us
five then you execute.

711
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,958
You got it.

712
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,750
(suspenseful music)

713
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
(muffled speaking
from police radio)

714
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:54,583
Showtime.

715
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,190
Now, y'all don't
shoot 'til you see

716
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:57,148
the whites of their thighs now.

717
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,291
(laughing)

718
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,958
(feet clomping)

719
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:06,208
Hey, how's it goin'?

720
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,541
Greetings from Vegas Vice.

721
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,833
(suspenseful music)

722
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:42,998
Hold it, police!

723
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:44,583
I'm a cop!

724
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,375
(tires squealing)

725
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:47,999
(door slamming)

726
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,791
(tires squealing)

727
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,625
(horn honking)

728
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:56,666
(tires squealing)

729
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:05,666
(crashing sound)

730
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:08,000
(suspenseful music)

731
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:11,666
(papers rifling)

732
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:22,958
Pay dirt.

733
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:24,416
What do you got there?

734
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,416
Employees and clients.

735
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:28,041
Good!

736
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:28,999
(suspenseful music)

737
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:32,875
(tires squealing)

738
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:35,125
(suspenseful music)

739
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,291
(tires squealing)

740
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:52,708
[Bugs] Back up,
backup, I need back up!

741
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:53,958
I'm heading for Red Rock!

742
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:54,999
Back up!

743
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:55,999
Come on, come on!

744
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,041
(horn honking)

745
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,375
(suspenseful music)

746
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:06,999
(tires squealing)

747
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:10,999
(motor revving)

748
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:14,166
(suspenseful music)

749
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,733
(muffled speaking
from police radio)

750
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
(sirens wailing)

751
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:30,999
(suspenseful music)

752
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:36,208
(tires squealing)

753
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,999
(sirens wailing)

754
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:50,998
(crashing boxes)

755
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,998
(tires squealing)

756
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:54,875
(large explosion)

757
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:05,666
(suspenseful music dying out)

758
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:16,998
(crackling fire)

759
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:20,083
(soft piano music)

760
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:29,125
(door slamming)

761
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:33,158
That was stupid thing to do.

762
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,825
You're not authorized
to issue an order

763
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,166
platoon backup.

764
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,083
You're not authorized to coordinate

765
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,999
a civilian business bust.

766
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,881
This has to be authorized
by me, you know that.

767
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:44,666
Just trying to save time Dan.

768
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,033
Well don't cut corners, Joe.

769
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,166
No end runs.

770
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,250
How's Robinson?

771
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,250
He's doin' fine.

772
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:52,541
They kept him in the
hospital overnight

773
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:53,500
for routine observation.

774
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,166
Damn insurance people.

775
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:57,041
You can't cough
sideways in this job

776
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,088
without having to spend a
night in the hospital.

777
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,041
You come up with anything?

778
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,999
We have the records, and
we spent all night

779
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,999
going through them, but
haven't found anything

780
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,666
to tie into our case yet.

781
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,125
Can I get my ball back?

782
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,125
Next time, I wanna be informed.

783
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:22,875
Ahh.

784
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:24,083
Good pitch.

785
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:30,541
(papers crinkling)

786
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,998
Three more Togo, two more to go.

787
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:35,000
Two more?

788
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:35,999
This is it?

789
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:36,833
Ho!

790
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:37,999
Hey Bugs.- Hey Bugs.

791
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,291
Welcome back.

792
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:40,625
Bugsy!

793
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:41,958
Uh, I feel fine, I
can't say too much for

794
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,039
that hospital food though.

795
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,583
Slept like a baby.

796
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,998
You guys look like zombies.

797
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:47,833
Bullshit.

798
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,999
Did you have a chance
to check out that car?

799
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,791
Yeah, apparently the
scumbag was just the driver.

800
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,878
He would drive the cash
from here to Los Angeles.

801
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:56,166
He was just there to pickup
the weekly proceeds.

802
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:58,500
They found over$100,000 in cash.

803
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:01,999
One folder left.

804
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,013
Oh, by the way, they
broke the LA affiliate

805
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,375
on that Pleasure Palace thing.

806
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,000
That's great.

807
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,286
Well, look, let's get this
thing sorted out over here,

808
00:36:11,313 --> 00:36:12,999
turn it over to the feds.

809
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,291
Ask LA to fax us whatever documents

810
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:18,083
or photos that they have.

811
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,541
Already done.

812
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:20,999
Remind me to put a gold
star on your time card.

813
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,203
Why don't you just give me
Willie Mays fourth homer?

814
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,250
(laughing)

815
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,208
Hello.

816
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,166
What do you got there?

817
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,541
Here.

818
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:33,958
We got one.

819
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:35,708
(suspenseful music)

820
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,625
And that's all we've got.

821
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,998
Look, I can't make anymore
sense out of this stuff

822
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:42,916
tonight, so, can we pack it in?

823
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:45,999
Well, I'll tell you
what, why don't we

824
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,125
wrap this up.

825
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,171
It's midnight now, we'll
meet back here at 8 am.

826
00:36:49,198 --> 00:36:51,239
Okay, look, my car's in
the shop, I need a ride.

827
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,291
I'll take you.

828
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:57,833
Thank you.

829
00:36:57,999 --> 00:36:59,719
Joe, I'm gonna stay
and put all this stuff

830
00:36:59,746 --> 00:37:00,958
on the database.

831
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:01,875
I slept enough at the hospital.

832
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:03,000
Yeah, good.

833
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:06,083
What the hell's wrong
with you guys?

834
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,916
It's good to have you back, Bugs.

835
00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:10,208
[Bugs] Thank you, partner.

836
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:11,375
No fake.

837
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:13,833
Do you want me to stay
and give you a hand?

838
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,719
No, you go ahead, you
look a little tired.

839
00:37:15,746 --> 00:37:17,371
Get some sleep.

840
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:20,375
(deep breath)

841
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:26,166
Anyway, that's how the
whole gang got started.

842
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,958
So now I know why the guys

843
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:30,279
didn't wanna bring you out here.

844
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:31,166
You live out in Iowa. (Chuckles)

845
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,833
Oh, I'm sorry.

846
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:34,759
They told me you had
quite a baseball career?

847
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,500
Yeah, what'd you hear
about my baseball career?

848
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:40,999
(laughing)

849
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,999
That you were really good.

850
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:42,916
Evidently not good enough.

851
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:45,199
I had the ability, I just
couldn't play the mental game,

852
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:46,416
the pressure.

853
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:47,983
When it came down to the big pitch,

854
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,083
I just couldn't get it across.

855
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,416
[Andrea] But they told me...

856
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:54,208
Ehh, full of crap.

857
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,250
Willie Mays' story right?

858
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:57,708
[Andrea] Yeah.

859
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,955
Yeah, they think I served
up the last pitch to Mays

860
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:02,291
so he could hit it.

861
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:04,178
They think I didn't wanna
embarrass my hero.

862
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:05,747
They're wrong.

863
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:08,018
Nobody have ever struck
out Mays before.

864
00:38:08,045 --> 00:38:10,666
I wanted this more than
anything else in my life.

865
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:14,791
So I had an opportunity, but
I blew it.

866
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:19,666
Couldn't make the big pitch.

867
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,416
Hmm, well that's my
story, what's yours?

868
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:29,625
I was married once.

869
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:33,211
You seem like the type
that would stay married.

870
00:38:33,238 --> 00:38:37,625
I would've liked it.

871
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,999
He was a lot older than me...

872
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:42,416
a Vietnam veteran.

873
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:45,998
It just got harder and
harder for him to adjust.

874
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:49,998
He couldn't get in sync
with the real world,

875
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,791
you know, he'd get
a job and lose it.

876
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:58,041
Then he got into a syndrome, he
started abusing drugs...

877
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,999
abusing me.

878
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:05,999
[Joe] He hurt you?

879
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:09,666
Yeah.

880
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:11,898
He hurt himself more
than he hurt me.

881
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:17,833
He killed himself.

882
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:19,291
(soft piano music)

883
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:23,928
Now that I made you drive
50 miles out here,

884
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:25,999
do you want to come up for
a drink or something?

885
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,999
Yeah, I'd love to.

886
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:33,999
(papers shuffling)

887
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,541
(keys tapping)

888
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:51,999
(laughing)

889
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:54,999
Anyway, her feet were
clean up in the air

890
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,375
behind the counter
at the donut shop.

891
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:59,041
(laughing)

892
00:39:59,208 --> 00:39:59,999
(coughing)

893
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:01,583
Excuse me.

894
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:03,791
Pardon me.

895
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:05,583
(laughing)

896
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:10,416
I'm really having fun.

897
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,750
I'm glad you came up.

898
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:13,999
Me too.

899
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,678
I better get back, I
gotta drive all the way

900
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:17,913
back to Vegas.

901
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,208
Yeah, you better go.

902
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,500
I better go.

903
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,750
It's a long drive.

904
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,541
It was a very, very long drive

905
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,750
from my home to Vegas. (Chuckles)

906
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:33,583
Get out.

907
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,375
(laughing)

908
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,000
Kick me out.

909
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,333
Okay.

910
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,958
(romantic piano music)

911
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,250
I never kissed a cop. (Chuckles)

912
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:49,541
You know, well I haven't
kissed a caveman in a while.

913
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:52,999
(mellow piano music)

914
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,999
All right, see if you can
get a cross reference on it.

915
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,999
Thanks a lot.

916
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,750
Bugsy, woow, yeah!

917
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:13,041
Hey, donuts fresh, coffee's
fresh, help yourself.

918
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,750
Good morning.

919
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:16,625
Mornin'

920
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:17,416
Wow.

921
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,223
Hey there desert dogs,
it came together.

922
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,625
Well let's not jump
to any conclusions.

923
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:24,791
[Andrea] Any cross
references, Bugs?

924
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:26,838
Okay, let's check it out here.
(keys slapping)

925
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:30,500
Here we go.

926
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:33,125
(keys slapping)

927
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,958
There you go.

928
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,000
How do they match up?

929
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:38,750
All right, let's see here.

930
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,250
(keys slapping)

931
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:41,750
There we go.

932
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,470
Yeah, print that, right
there, right there.

933
00:41:44,497 --> 00:41:46,166
(keys slapping)

934
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,208
They're all redheads.

935
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,583
They all appear to be redheads.

936
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,870
You know what, there's
something about this redhead.

937
00:41:52,897 --> 00:41:57,333
Why she remind you of one
of your beach bunnies?

938
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,333
All right, knock it off, come on.

939
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,833
Let's do some cop work.

940
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:08,791
[Mike] Tony
Nazarae, look at this man.

941
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:10,678
I can't believe this
guy's still a free man.

942
00:42:10,705 --> 00:42:11,998
(shutter snaps)

943
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:12,999
He's gotta be involved
in this somehow.

944
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,885
[Bugs] Yeah, he's in
every photo we pulled.

945
00:42:14,912 --> 00:42:17,666
(shutter snap)

946
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,166
(suspenseful music)

947
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:27,875
(shutter snap)

948
00:42:27,999 --> 00:42:29,333
(suspenseful music)

949
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,458
(shutter snap)

950
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:38,666
(shutter snap)

951
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:40,583
(suspenseful music)

952
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,998
(shutter snap)

953
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:47,541
(suspenseful music)

954
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:54,708
You know, it's not like I

955
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,275
got the greatest look at this girl.

956
00:42:56,302 --> 00:42:57,750
I never forget a pretty face.

957
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:59,291
(chuckling)

958
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,338
Well, I'll tell you, some
people prefer girls.

959
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,958
Why don't you have another look.

960
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:11,833
I don't know, I can't
tell for sure.

961
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,291
Okay, okay, thank you, thank you.

962
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,625
Sorry.

963
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:18,191
You have a precious evening, huh?

964
00:43:18,218 --> 00:43:21,343
See you soon.

965
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:23,791
(suspenseful music)

966
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:28,083
(shutter snap)

967
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,208
(suspenseful music)

968
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:34,750
(shutter snap)

969
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:44,625
(suspenseful music)

970
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:58,125
Well right now, we don't
know if the relationship

971
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:00,291
between the victims and the
hookers means anything.

972
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:03,833
You think one of them
might be the killer?

973
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:05,416
I don't know, this is all
we got to go on right now.

974
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:07,750
I checked one possible
eyewitness, and he couldn't

975
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:09,596
give me a positive ID
on any of the photos.

976
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:12,708
What'd you have on the girls?

977
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,750
Well Cherie and Rosalind
were still current

978
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:16,836
employees of the agency
at that time of the bust.

979
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:20,416
Apparently, the third
on here, Christine,

980
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,500
she booked out a long time ago.

981
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:25,875
[Dan] I'll hang onto this one.

982
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:28,280
Give it tot he FBI, we'll turn
it around on a nation-wide.

983
00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:31,998
Good, good.

984
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:33,833
We checked the girls'
most recent addresses

985
00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:35,708
and they both skipped.

986
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,041
We're holding three other
girls and a secretary

987
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,008
from the agency, so I
figure if we squeeze 'em

988
00:44:39,035 --> 00:44:41,999
a little bit, they may
do a little singing.

989
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:44,999
Hey Dan, you got a cigarette?

990
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:53,666
You gotta light?

991
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:59,250
(lighter flicking on)

992
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:03,998
These things are gonna kill ya.

993
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:06,625
(laughing)

994
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:09,583
(suspenseful music)

995
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:15,998
(shutter snap)

996
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:17,999
(suspenseful music)

997
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,208
(shutter snap)

998
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:21,250
(suspenseful music)

999
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:22,458
(shutter snap)

1000
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:39,333
All the working girls have
had priors, minor stuff,

1001
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,020
but it's the first
time down for Lilly.

1002
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:44,083
She was a receptionist.

1003
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,125
Divorced, single parent.

1004
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:48,250
According to the
neighbors, she takes

1005
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:49,536
really good care of her kid.

1006
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:51,143
Ew, you checked
with the neighbors?

1007
00:45:51,161 --> 00:45:52,161
(hand smack)

1008
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:52,999
Good cop work, right?

1009
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,203
Anyway, she even tried to get
him in a private school.

1010
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,875
St. Anthony's?

1011
00:45:56,972 --> 00:45:57,972
Yeah.

1012
00:45:57,999 --> 00:45:58,999
So what happened?

1013
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,583
She couldn't afford it.

1014
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,250
So the hookers
make all the bread,

1015
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:03,976
and she's just at
clerical minimum wage?

1016
00:46:04,003 --> 00:46:06,250
Yeah.

1017
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:07,625
She's really scared, Joe.

1018
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:08,625
I don't think she's gonna talk.

1019
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:10,416
Well I got an idea.

1020
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:12,791
I'm gonna make a few calls
before I talk to her.

1021
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:15,375
That's real good work.

1022
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:19,208
(church bells ringing)

1023
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:22,875
[Joe] Father Alan, this is Joe.

1024
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:24,399
And where were you the other day.

1025
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,940
I reserved a court
for us to play on.

1026
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:28,000
Hey, after that20-point blowout

1027
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:30,206
you had on me last week, well
what do you think I am,

1028
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:31,791
some kinda masochist?

1029
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:33,678
You expect me to comeback
for a little more?

1030
00:46:33,705 --> 00:46:34,998
Eh, listen to the big baby.

1031
00:46:34,999 --> 00:46:36,625
What? I hurt our feelin's?

1032
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,191
You got the height,
I got the moves.

1033
00:46:38,218 --> 00:46:39,916
Yeah, you didn't
tell me your college

1034
00:46:39,999 --> 00:46:41,416
roommate was Mugsy Bokes.

1035
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:43,083
It's slippery little guys like you

1036
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,333
that take advantage of
big slow guys like me.

1037
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,458
Okay.

1038
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:49,458
All right, we're on.

1039
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:50,999
Same place, same time, and hey...

1040
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:53,208
you better grease up those
snickers of yours peewee,

1041
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,999
because I'm takin' you
to the hole this time.

1042
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,375
Okay, you're on.

1043
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:00,421
And I promise to cut
down on my cursing, okay?

1044
00:47:00,448 --> 00:47:02,750
All right.

1045
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:04,356
Oh, uh, I almost
forgot why I called.

1046
00:47:04,383 --> 00:47:06,833
Listen, Father, I'm gonna
need a big favor from you.

1047
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:10,875
It's about this lady and her son.

1048
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:14,291
(whimpering)

1049
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:19,083
I can't believe this
is happening to me.

1050
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:24,000
Who will take care of my son?

1051
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:26,083
Well he's fine, he's okay.

1052
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,625
(gasp)

1053
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:30,666
Here.

1054
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:33,833
Thank you.

1055
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:35,999
(crying)

1056
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:41,666
You think maybe you could
help us out on this?

1057
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:47,625
I don't know.

1058
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:49,231
Look, you got nothing
to worry about.

1059
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:50,838
We've taken out the
LA operation too.

1060
00:47:50,865 --> 00:47:53,791
Really?

1061
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:54,998
So whoever or
whatever is left over

1062
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:56,416
from the business, they're not

1063
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,000
gonna be interested
in what we want.

1064
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,250
So you, just take your time.

1065
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:04,750
(papers rustling)

1066
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:09,291
What's this?

1067
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,708
It's a friend of mine over at St.
Anthony's,

1068
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:13,595
he's got a couple of
scholarships available,

1069
00:48:13,622 --> 00:48:16,125
said he has one for your
son if you want it.

1070
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:19,000
There's also a clerical
position available,

1071
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:21,583
doesn't pay much, but they
have free on-campus housing

1072
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:24,999
for staff.

1073
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:27,515
So if you think you
might be interested...

1074
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,666
Thanks.

1075
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:36,208
What do you wanna know?

1076
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,415
There he is, Tony Nazarae, your
typical, dangerous,

1077

you name it.

1079
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:49,298
For some reason, he's
tied into every operation

1080
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:50,999
in town.

1081
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,441
He specializes in high-end hookers,

1082
00:48:52,468 --> 00:48:55,083
and that's where our
girls have gone.

1083
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,583
Now he's going big-time.

1084
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,670
He's starting to take over
everybody's operation.

1085
00:48:59,697 --> 00:49:02,739
But before that happens, we're
gonna get him.

1086
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,880
Folks, he's going down, and
he's going down hard.

1087
00:49:07,907 --> 00:49:09,998
I want you to stake him out.

1088
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:11,666

like ugly on an ape.

He's gone.

1099
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:56,403
He went out the back stairwell?

1100
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,290

tests came back clean,

1166
00:54:02,999 --> 00:54:04,041
so you're off the hook.

1167
00:54:05,999 --> 00:54:07,879
I do need your help with
one thing though, uh...

1168
00:54:07,906 --> 00:54:10,698
do you recognize her?

1169
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,583
Yes.

1170
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,375
Yeah, uh-huh.

1171
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:17,916
We all started with Tony.

1172
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:19,999
And Christine was
mostly a loner though.

1173
00:54:20,125 --> 00:54:22,998
Cherie and I, we always hung out,

1174
00:54:22,999 --> 00:54:24,999
but we could never
get through to her.

1175
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,080
The three of us went to
the Place at the same time,

1176
00:54:27,107 --> 00:54:30,875
but she was just in
it for the money.

1177
00:54:30,998 --> 00:54:32,998
I mean, she never got into
the drugs or the parties

1178
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:36,041
or anything.

1179
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:37,625
Did she do something wrong?

1180
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:39,711
Well, do you know whether
she's in town or not?

1181
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:42,780
I don't know.

1182
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:45,393
I remember she had
only a few clients,

1183
00:54:45,394 --> 00:54:47,560
and she dropped out of
business a few years ago,

1184
00:54:47,727 --> 00:54:50,666
and we haven't seen her since.

1185
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:52,750
We were never friends.

1186
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,310
Last I heard, which
was some time ago,

1187
00:54:56,337 --> 00:54:59,545
she was supposedly seeing a cop.

1188
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:04,958
Thank you.

1189
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:07,041
(suspenseful music)

1190
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Anyway, the strange
thing was, she said

1191
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:30,041
the last rumor she heard
was that Christine

1192
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:31,999
was dating a cop.

1193
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:33,999
Ew, a cop, huh?

1194
00:55:35,306 --> 00:55:36,306
It was probably Mike.

1195
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,250
Hi Mike.

1196
00:55:38,416 --> 00:55:39,999

1197
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,875
What do you need?

1198
00:55:40,999 --> 00:55:41,833
I need the 1990 photo album

1199
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:44,166
from the annual picnic thing.

1200
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:46,541
Oh sure, let me see
if I can find it.

1201
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:48,333
Thank you.

1202
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:52,916
Here it is, 1990, first year
on the job if I recollect.

1203
00:55:56,999 --> 00:55:58,666

1204
00:55:58,833 --> 00:55:59,583

1205
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,270
I'm just looking
for something, okay?

1206
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:12,833
(suspenseful music)

1207
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:44,708
[Joe] The girl said she
had a few more clients,

1208
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:45,958

1209
00:56:45,999 --> 00:56:47,458
You know who you talkin' to?

1210
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:49,999

1211
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:56,125
Well, who the hell's John Doe?

1212
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:57,708
[Bugs] Shit, I don't know.

1213
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:59,333
Bring back Douglas.

1214
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,999

1215
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,583
Woot, there it is.

1216
00:57:05,999 --> 00:57:08,791

1226
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:26,591
[Pop] Well like all
retired cops, miserable.

1227
00:57:26,618 --> 00:57:27,998
Don't ever retire.

1228
00:57:27,999 --> 00:57:29,639
Of course, workin' in
Vegas compared to LA

1229
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:32,125
is like being retired, right?

1230
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:33,875
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1231
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:35,559
[Pop] Are you in
trouble or something?

1232
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:36,998
No, no, no, nothing like that.

1233
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:39,541
I gotta question to ask you.

1234
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:41,208
Now what would you
do if you suspected

1235
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,999
one of your fellow officers?

1236
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:45,125
[Pop] Are the boys on the take?

1237
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:47,131
No, no, it's not one
of the boys on the take,

1238
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:48,772
it's just, um,
actually, it's the captain.

1239
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,039
[Pop]} Bronski?

1240
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:54,205
Yeah, and I think he might
be involved in a murder.

1241
00:57:54,232 --> 00:57:56,999
[Pop] Jesus, have
you told anyone?

1242
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:59,291
No, I haven't told anyone.

1243
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:00,708
[Pop] Don't, and make
damn sure that you're

1244
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:02,333
right about this,
and make damn sure

1245
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,999
that your ass if covered.

1246
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,208
You got it?

1247
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:06,125
Yeah, I got it.

1248
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:07,731
[Pop] Mike, be
careful on this one.

1249
00:58:07,758 --> 00:58:09,208
Okay.

1250
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:10,625
[Pop] You call me
if you need anything.

1251
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,191
All right, I'll
talk to you later.

1252
00:58:12,218 --> 00:58:13,500
[Pop] Mike, be careful.

1253
00:58:13,666 --> 00:58:14,666
All right, bye.

00:58:15,999 --> 00:58:17,583
(electronic a, foreboding music)

1255
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:36,666
(footsteps)

1256
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Douglas Harbaugh please.

1257
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:56,916
Hi Doug, it's Christine.

1258
00:58:56,999 --> 00:58:58,541
I got your page?

1259
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:05,208
Tomorrow night, Maxim,
10 o'clock, that'll be fine.

1260
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:15,083
Is red still your favorite color?

1261
00:59:17,999 --> 00:59:18,999
Really?

1262
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:21,999
No, I won't wear panties.

1263
00:59:23,999 --> 00:59:25,541
I'll get a suite at the Maxim.

1264
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:29,999
Okay, bye.

1265
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:36,833
I don't like it when you do that.

1266
00:59:36,999 --> 00:59:39,916
Dan, that's my
job, you know that.

1267
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:43,916
That's what I do.

1268
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:48,916
(scintillating music)

1269
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:04,125
[Dan] Christine.
(objects smashing)

1270
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:13,375
No!

1271
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:17,458
(mellow jingle)

1272
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:30,666
Morning Joe.

1273
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,073
Morning Heather, the boss in?

1274
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,100
No he's not in.

1275
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:34,565
He took a three-day
leave of absence.

1276
01:00:34,592 --> 01:00:35,592
He left yesterday.

1277
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:38,159
A three-day leave of absence?

1278
01:00:38,186 --> 01:00:39,291
Is there an echo in here?

1279
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:40,999
What the hell's going on.

1280
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:41,999
Where is he?

1281
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,800
Joe, you're just not
morning people are you?

1282
01:00:43,827 --> 01:00:45,333
How the heck should I know.

1283
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,140
He left on personal
business, he said he'd

1284
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:48,208
be back Monday.

1285
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:49,935
I don't like to pry
like some people do.

1286
01:00:49,962 --> 01:00:52,208
Did get he the information back

1287
01:00:52,335 --> 01:00:53,975
on one of our suspects, he
called the FBI?

1288
01:00:54,002 --> 01:00:56,125
He never called the FBI.

1289
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:57,291
He called the FBI.

1290
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:58,653
He never called
the FBI, and if he

1291
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:00,228
had called the FBI, I
would have known.

1292
01:01:00,271 --> 01:01:01,471
I would have placed that call.

1293
01:01:01,498 --> 01:01:02,999
Hey, don't take... You-_-_.

1294
01:01:03,041 --> 01:01:04,998
You better not go in there.

1295
01:01:04,999 --> 01:01:06,500
He's not gonna like this.

1296
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:09,000
(mellow piano music)

1297
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,999
(door shutting)

1298
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:15,083
(keys rattling)

1299
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:36,958
(shuffling trash)

1300
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,750
(suspenseful music)

1301
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,833
Well hang onto this one.

1302
01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:47,791
Give it to the FBI.

1303
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,250
What the hell?

1304
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,875
What?

1305
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:58,250
(children playing in the distance)

1306
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:20,416
(doors shutting)

1307
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:28,999
(door knocks)

1308
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:31,875
Something's wrong in there.

1309
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,666
(suspenseful music)

1310
01:02:37,999 --> 01:02:42,999
Dan?

1311
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:44,250
Dan, ya here, it's Joe.

1312
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:47,999
(cat screeching)

1313
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:51,000
(suspenseful music)

1314
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:59,125
Clear.

1315
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:03,541
Oh, look at this.

1316
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,291
It's Christine.

1317
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:11,000
You think Bronski beat John Doe?

1318
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,333
God, I hope not.

1319
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,375
Let's go.

1320
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,583
(suspenseful music)

1321
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:26,833
Dan?

1322
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:33,125
(electronic sound effect)

1323
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:34,999
It's Mike!

1324
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:36,083
Mike!

1325
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,500
Is he alive?

1326
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:39,106
Oh, thank God, he's
still breathing.

1327
01:03:39,133 --> 01:03:41,257
Oh, Mike.

1328
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:45,125
Come on, come on, come on.

1329
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:47,208
Owens, homicide here, we
got an officer down,

1330
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:50,750
10616 Andrew's place.

1331
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:53,041
One-zero-six-one-six
Andrew's Place.

1332
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:58,875
She's been here, Joe.

1333
01:03:58,999 --> 01:04:00,541
Well if she's involved with Dan,

1334
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:01,988
what the hell's Mike doin' here?

1335
01:04:02,015 --> 01:04:04,458
Bronski's gotta be John Doe.

1336
01:04:04,625 --> 01:04:05,999
Eh, this really stinks.

1337
01:04:07,999 --> 01:04:08,999
Look, Doug Harbaugh.

1338
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:11,625
10 pm, Maxims.

1339
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:12,999
He's gotta be next.

1340
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,458
Call Bugs.

1341
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:17,583
Hang in there Mike.

1342
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,666
(whimpering)

1343
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:24,916
[Joe] Bugs?

1344
01:04:24,999 --> 01:04:26,500
(suspenseful music)

1345
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:45,166
Well, Doug said you'd Bethe
most beautiful woman

1346
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:47,333
in the bar, and he ain't lyin'.

1347
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,833
You are Christine, aren't you?

1348
01:04:49,999 --> 01:04:51,541
I'm Christine and I'm flattered.

1349
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:54,999
Well Doug detained on business,

1350
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,625
mind if I sit down?

1351
01:04:56,791 --> 01:04:57,916
No, please do.

1352
01:04:59,083 --> 01:05:04,041
Can I get a beer, please?

1353
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:15,083
Relic from my past.

1354
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,500
Lucky charm?

1355
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:18,083
Don't know.

1356
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,833
That's my lucky charm.

1357
01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:23,000
[Christine] A baseball?

1358
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:24,166
Oh yeah.

1359
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:25,891
Oh, good pitch,
Joe, you mac-daddy you.

1360
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:31,666
So, Doug's a busy man?

1361
01:05:33,666 --> 01:05:34,708
And successful.

1362
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,041
And successful?

1363
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:38,416
Mm-Hmm.

1364
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:40,999
So, tell me Joe, are
you successful?

1365
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,999
Oh yeah.

1366
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:46,958
Nice boots, how'd you
like to take them off

1367
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:49,416
and have a good time...

1368
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:51,291
Well, when I have a good time,

1369
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:53,666
I like to keep my boots on.
(laughing)

1370
01:05:57,875 --> 01:05:58,875
(suspenseful music)

1371
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,541
All right, he's on his
way to the elevator.

1372
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:12,458
Okay, he's on the elevator.

1373
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:14,958
Where you goin' Joe?

1374
01:06:14,999 --> 01:06:16,583
Where you goin'
baby, where you goin',

1375
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:17,999
talk to me Joe.

1376
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,416
Mmm, soft 17, gets me
in trouble every time.

1377
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:27,416
Soft 17.

1378
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:29,408
Seventeenth floor, let's go.

1379
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:35,999
Come on, say it, say it, say it.

1380
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:40,111
Come on, we need a room number.

1381
01:06:40,138 --> 01:06:41,791
What's the number?

1382
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:42,998
(elevator dings)

1383
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,375
So what room you stayin' in?

1384
01:06:45,541 --> 01:06:46,708
17-17.

1385
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48,166
That's funny.

1386
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:49,933
I was in room 17-17 when
I was at Bally's.

1387
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,583
Must be fate.

1388
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,083
What?

1389
01:06:53,999 --> 01:06:56,916
I didn't get it.

1390
01:06:56,999 --> 01:06:58,041
Damn!

1391
01:06:58,999 --> 01:07:01,999
(grunting)

1392
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:05,208
(door closing)

1393
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:09,271
Why don't you make
yourself at home?

1394
01:07:09,298 --> 01:07:12,049
Oh, I will.
(Chuckles)

1395
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:16,041
(footsteps)

1396
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:19,750
Love my job.

1397
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:24,958
You need a hand in there?

1398
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,666
[Christine] No, I'm fine.

1399
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,791
(suspenseful music)

1400
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:33,791
Medication, CFS.

1401
01:07:34,999 --> 01:07:38,000
CFS, that's the chronic
fatigue syndrome, huh?

1402
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:42,833
You don't look like
you are fatigued.

1403
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:49,375
No rest for the wicked.

1404
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,791
(heels clomping)

1405
01:07:56,041 --> 01:08:01,041
Mind if I leave this open?

1406
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:02,708
No, that's fine.

1407
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,500
Now, couches are fun, but...

1408
01:08:07,999 --> 01:08:09,666
Thank you (mumbles)use
your phone.

1409
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:11,916
Make sure they got the stairwells,

1410
01:08:11,999 --> 01:08:13,719
and have them cut the
power in the elevator.

1411
01:08:13,746 --> 01:08:15,416
Back up, do you read?

1412
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:16,791
I read you.

1413
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:18,125
We got back up coming up and
a helicopter flying in.

1414
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:19,999
(helicopter blade spinning)

1415
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:22,999
Operator, this is
Officer Thompson,

1416
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:25,125
I need the names of everyone
on the 17th floor now!

1417
01:08:28,999 --> 01:08:32,500
Christine!

1418
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:37,125
Dan, what are you doing?

1419
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:39,000
Why are you here?

1420
01:08:40,999 --> 01:08:45,999
You're a cop?

1421
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,250
That's right.

1422
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,998
First time in your life you
ever figured something out.

1423
01:08:50,999 --> 01:08:53,833
What the hell you doin' Dan?

1424
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:55,159
Dan, what is going on here?

1425
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:56,625
What is this?

1426
01:08:56,791 --> 01:08:57,583
This is your life Christine.

1427
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:59,416
This is what you made me do!

1428
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:01,541
I'm cleaning up all your lovers!

1429
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:05,285
What are you talking about?

1430
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:07,833
What I've done for you!

1431
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:10,958
Take it easy, Dan.

1432
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:13,533
They're all dead, Christine.

1433
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,435
