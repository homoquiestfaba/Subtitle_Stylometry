1
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,313
- Eh!

2
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,882
That's a gun asshole.

3
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,159
What the fuck are
you doing here, huh?

4
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,462
This can't be no coincidence.

5
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,364
Who sent you?

6
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,299
Who sent you?

7
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,703
Nobody in this town
crosses Lorenzo, no one.

8
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,938
You're a dead man!

9
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,688
- Hey!

10
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,390
Hey!

11
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,558
Hey!

12
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,692
You, you!

13
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,227
Motherfucker!

14
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,823
- Hello?

15
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:18,757
- Roy?

16
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,826
- Jimmy, what's up?

17
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,327
- Things went bad
man, really bad.

18
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,562
- Hey hold on.

19
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,830
What happened, now
do you have the car?

20
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:25,831
- Yea I got the car,
but what the fuck

21
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,832
did you get me into?

22
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,700
- Hey, now take it easy.

23
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,836
Now, tell me what happened.

24
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:31,903
- I did exactly what you said!

25
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,605
I was there within the window.

26
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,524
And then some guys show's up,

27
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,442
puts a gun in my face, and
you guaranteed me that time!

28
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,711
- But you got away?

29
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,747
- Yea I got away but I had
to stab the dude in the neck!

30
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,783
I boost cars, I don't stab
motherfuckers in the neck!

31
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,018
- Okay, now listen.

32
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,387
We can fix this.

33
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,957
But, you got to bring
the car to the location.

34
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,891
I'll meet you there.

35
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,394
- Who's Lorenzo?

36
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,697
- How do you know that name?

37
00:04:59,033 --> 00:04:59,898
- Who is he?

38
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,500
Roy, you fucked me man!

39
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,901
- Now Jimmy, you knew this
was going to be risky.

40
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,354
Now trust me.

41
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,772
You don't want to fuck
with these people.

42
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,707
If you bring us
the car right now,

43
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,841
I can fix this.

44
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,576
- Fuck you!

45
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:12,878
Who's us?

46
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,946
You fucked me man,
you knew those guys

47
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:15,847
were going to be there.

48
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:16,982
You set me up!

49
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,551
- Think about this Jimmy.

50
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,687
This is going to be
the most important

51
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,021
move of your life.

52
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,024
It's bad enough you have one
gangster out to kill you.

53
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,000
Jimmy.

54
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,468
Jimmy!

55
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,715
- Detroit's a single mother

56
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,251
living in a trailer park
with a baby on her hip.

57
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,087
And L.A.'s a porn
star with fake tits,

58
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,290
deep pockets, and
a coke problem.

59
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,126
Everybody comes out
here to find something.

60
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,595
Or run away from something.

61
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,597
I'm doing both.

62
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,266
Figured it was my
environment that was

63
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,235
making me who I was.

64
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,237
When you fuck around like this,

65
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,739
doesn't matter what
city you live in.

66
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,942
Sooner of later,

67
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,778
things are bound to get bloody.

68
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,814
Rule number one.

69
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,216
Stay away from cars less
than five years old.

70
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,118
I usually go for
toyotas or hondas.

71
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,087
The japs know how to make cars.

72
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,157
Rule number two,
stay away from any

73
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,992
high-end luxury sports cars,

74
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,895
Mercedes, BMW, Audi.

75
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,997
Sure, the payout
might be higher,

76
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,231
but then so is the risk.

77
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,835
Rule number three.

78
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,605
Mental focus, it's
all about the breath.

79
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,610
Keeping your head
clear, and being present

80
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,978
is of Paramount importance when

81
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,245
a boost is going down.

82
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,148
I started this when i
was young and desperate

83
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,284
and bored, but i
had a talent for it.

84
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,353
On my best days, I would
say it's a calling.

85
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,089
Not like the other
fuckos who joyride around

86
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,223
and abuse it.

87
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,293
And yes, if you aren't
a moron, being a thief

88
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,861
ain't so dangerous.

89
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,230
But this is my practice,
this is my discipline.

90
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:36,735
Rule number four,
perception is reality.

91
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,103
You'd be amazing with
what you can get away with

92
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,371
if you look like you're working.

93
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,740
But I am working.

94
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,243
Rule number five, you
pick the day in advance,

95
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,378
but not the car.

96
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,047
Picking the car is
like deciding if you're

97
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,915
going to go talk to
a girl at the bar.

98
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,385
It's a frequency you tune into.

99
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,987
You can call it a gut instinct,

100
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,223
for me, it's been like a
wave at the back of my spine.

101
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,691
And I don't know if
it's the excitement

102
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,660
of the unknown,
or the adrenaline,

103
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,328
but it's never wrong.

104
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,032
I guess deep down, it's
the part I like best.

105
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,202
I've stolen 336 cars
in the last 10 years,

106
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,938
and this whooptie maked it 337.

107
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,443
Rule six, you never
trust anyone in the game.

108
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:19,377
Ever.

109
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,414
And one last thing,

110
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,784
always know your price.

111
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,919
My name is Jimmy greco.

112
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,889
And this is the story
of the day I died.

113
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:52,877
Good morning.

114
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,746
- Good morning.

115
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,014
- Surprise.

116
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,093
- Do all guys
from the east coast

117
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,394
put it down like you?

118
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,831
- I'm from Detroit baby.

119
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,968
- That's basically
the east coast.

120
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,771
- Not really.

121
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:23,842
- Well it's closer to new
York than it is to California.

122
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,443
- True.

123
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,047
But the answer's no.

124
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,817
- No what?

125
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:36,020
- No, not all guys
from the east are like me.

126
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,391
Want to know the reason
it feels so good?

127
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,528
- Why?

128
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,929
- 'Cause I love you.

129
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,068
- Careful Jimmy.

130
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,440
- You're the one that
needs to be careful.

131
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,042
I'm fine expressing my emotions.

132
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,311
I know what it means.

133
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,479
- Is that a fact?

134
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,516
- I could die tomorrow,
and then what?

135
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,419
Think any of this
is going to matter?

136
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,322
We're dust baby.

137
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,059
- We're not just dust Jimmy.

138
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,328
We're human beings.

139
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,298
- But it's our human
minds that assign

140
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,133
meaning to our lives.

141
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,036
I fucking love you, so what?

142
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,438
What are you going
to do about it?

143
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,907
- How romantic.

144
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,144
I'll think about that while
i make your breakfast.

145
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,915
- Brew the coffee strong please.

146
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,019
- I know how you like it.

147
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,425
- Shit
is fucking good!

148
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,363
- Yea, it's not bad.

149
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,334
- Not bad?

150
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,401
It's way better then anything
else out there right now.

151
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,970
- So?

152
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,505
Doesn't make it amazing
just 'cause it's better

153
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,106
than all the other
shit out there.

154
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:05,143
- Babe, this negativity
is really off putting.

155
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,978
I mean yea, we finally
get some good shit,

156
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,479
and you're over there.

157
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,884
I totally forgot this fucking
monkey was sitting here.

158
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,487
What's up man?

159
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,523
Hmm, you got the money?

160
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,894
Maybe I'll just bleed
you out instead.

161
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,364
- It's okay gevorg.

162
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,334
Baby, nobody's
getting cut today.

163
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,871
Too messy, I'm in no mood.

164
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,645
- Fine.

165
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,951
Why the fuck are you
still sitting here?

166
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,431
- Hola!

167
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,933
- Yo, what the fuck man?

168
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,534
- Como estas?

169
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:06,571
- Yo, I told you
not to come out here

170
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,273
without calling me first.

171
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,042
- Hey you think i
give a shit about your

172
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,244
chavalos and your
powder pushing?

173
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,580
- Do all you fucking beaners
got maize in your ears?

174
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,917
Or is it just you, huh?

175
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,152
- Let me tell you
something, loco.

176
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,022
You keep pushing me,

177
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,124
you're not going to
like what happens.

178
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,362
- Fuck you going to do?

179
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:37,001
- How about, I call some of
my cartel boys down here,

180
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,637
to rape your little slut,

181
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,442
gouge your eyes out,
watch you peck around

182
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,678
like a fucking blind chicken.

183
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,422
Hey, come on, lighten up, loco!

184
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:00,224
Shit, I called you, i
left a message, read?

185
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,626
You never got back to me.

186
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,461
So I came down here in person,

187
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,031
to discuss some
time-sensitive business.

188
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,502
- Fucking blow got me all jumpy.

189
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:14,639
What the fuck do you want?

190
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,740
Make it quick.

191
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:19,043
- How would you like to
expand your business?

192
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,579
- Well you know I would love to,

193
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,348
but Lorenzo runs the show.

194
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,183
I'm already at
capacity, in accordance

195
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,751
with our agreement.

196
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,555
- What if Lorenzo's
not around anymore?

197
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,157
- What if, what if?

198
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,360
What if?

199
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,998
- Some shit's getting
ready to go down.

200
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,304
- I'm listening.

201
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,139
- The question is,
how much would you

202
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:51,142
be willing to pay
to get in on it?

203
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:54,746
- Huh.

204
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,487
Since you seem to be
the man with the plan,

205
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,055
why don't you save
us both the time

206
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,656
and let me know how much
it's going to cost me?

207
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,725
- I'm not sure.

208
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,528
I'm going to have to
talk to my best guy.

209
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,063
And then double it.

210
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,768
- Yea, why do we need the best?

211
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,105
- Word is, Lorenzo's
dying, amigo.

212
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,407
He needs a kidney.

213
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,542
- Yea, how do you know this?

214
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,446
- Because birdies
talk, and birdies sing.

215
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,550
And then big Tommy
pays me a visit.

216
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,653
Yea, well well.

217
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,089
- Don't start with
me bro, I'd prefer to

218
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,491
make this as painless
as possible, alright?

219
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,360
- Good to see you old friend.

220
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,097
- We're not friends
anymore, are we Roy?

221
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,534
- Well, since your
little accident.

222
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,071
- I'm here to talk business.

223
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,839
- Okay, well,

224
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,375
how about a little drink
for old time's sake?

225
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,579
- No.

226
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,082
I need you to move
something for me.

227
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,486
- You know what they
say about forgiveness?

228
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,458
To forgive is to
set a prisoner free.

229
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,428
Then you find you
that prisoner's you.

230
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,667
- It's time sensitive.

231
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,769
And extremely valuable,
and that's why

232
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,637
I came to you.

233
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,709
- He wants me to courier
a package from Mexico.

234
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,780
Tells me that there's a
kidney inside that box.

235
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,249
- Yea, makes sense I guess.

236
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,551
Nobody's seen Lorenzo in months.

237
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,488
- Big Tommy was
very, very serious

238
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,423
about the time frame.

239
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,758
- Won't they know it was you?

240
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,195
- They'll suspect.

241
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,396
With all the
connections I got, I got

242
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,798
diplomatic immunity.

243
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,733
- And what if they
come after you anyway?

244
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,137
- You let me worry about that.

245
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,307
Lorenzo's got way too
many enemies down south.

246
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,677
- And little birdie's do talk.

247
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,550
- When you're
alone, it's hard

248
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,152
to be present with
your thoughts.

249
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,421
And that's our
innate fear of death

250
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,790
manifesting around the
things we can't control.

251
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,726
- No, man.

252
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,829
It's 'cause I've got regrets.

253
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,832
- But you can't change the past.

254
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,535
- Yea, but at least if
I'm going to get clipped,

255
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,370
I know it's going to
fucking happen fast.

256
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,772
What I'm most terrified of,

257
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,708
is the thought of a
slow painful death,

258
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,944
not actually dying.

259
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,179
Especially after what I saw
my dad go through, you know?

260
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:43,681
- God rest his soul.

261
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,715
- Yep.

262
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,517
Cheers to that, man.

263
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,728
What's up with
the lotus ink bro?

264
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,898
- Take the boy out the hood.

265
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,868
- Is that a gang tattoo?

266
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,504
- No man, we just got pride
from where we're from.

267
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,540
Those guys had my
back and I had theirs.

268
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,977
We weren't a gang in the
traditional sense, but

269
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,512
we protected each other.

270
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,614
- So why'd you leave, man?

271
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,650
- Honestly?

272
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,458
Too cold.

273
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:30,828
- Uh huh.

274
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,333
So is that really why you left?

275
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,802
The weather?

276
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,871
- Me and my boys got in a
fight outside the derby.

277
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,241
One of them got shot.

278
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,909
Did you know Rick mckeeum?

279
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,311
- Nah, man.

280
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:51,249
- After that, things
just kind of slowed down.

281
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:52,683
Felt like I was
waiting around for

282
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:53,951
something bad to happen.

283
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,921
Figured if I came out here,

284
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,823
give me a chance to start fresh.

285
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,425
- How's it working out for you?

286
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:03,995
- It's working.

287
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:09,734
'Cause I'm sitting
here, with Clyde,

288
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,869
drinking beers
and getting a tan.

289
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,575
What about you, why'd you leave?

290
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:20,945
- Do you remember
Mike, my cousin?

291
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,848
- I never knew him,
i remember he got killed.

292
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:27,351
- Yea, well after...

293
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,656
My father died, and Mike,

294
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:36,360
I kind of realized I was
going down the wrong path.

295
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,397
- I'm sorry, i
know you guys were close.

296
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,633
- I wasn't ever really
that close to my dad, man.

297
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,068
Not like you.

298
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,479
- I was talking about Michael.

299
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,850
- Right, right.

300
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:16,901
- Jimmy!

301
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,336
- Mr. slick!

302
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:21,939
- Come on to the office.

303
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:23,908
- Nah man, I got to get going.

304
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,376
I just got to go.

305
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:26,744
- I got some Tequila,
and I want to

306
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,379
talk to you anyway, come on.

307
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,527
- There's an extra
1,000 bucks here.

308
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,963
- I thought you
deserved a little bonus.

309
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,367
- No thanks.

310
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,435
- Jimmy, don't be rude.

311
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:52,870
- I don't mean to be rude, but I

312
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,672
like our arrangement
just fine the way it is.

313
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:56,140
And I know what it
means if I take that.

314
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:58,943
- What are you talking about?

315
00:22:58,945 --> 00:22:59,977
- It means I work for you.

316
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,979
- And what do you do now?

317
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,815
- Now I work with you,
there's a big difference.

318
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:06,150
- How's that?

319
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,552
- Simple.

320
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,088
I bring you cars
for $2,500 a pop.

321
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,023
And you know as well as I do,

322
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,792
I can go anywhere in town
and get that same price.

323
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:17,428
What makes us special, is
that we're both consistent.

324
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,030
- Is that a fact?

325
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,165
- Damn straight.

326
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,534
- You know?

327
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,706
This Tequila's
made from a cactus.

328
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:33,411
Meant to be sipped, and enjoyed.

329
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,980
To power and money.

330
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,621
You know, but sometimes Jimmy,

331
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,156
you got to just say, "fuck it."

332
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,795
- What's this about Roy?

333
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,965
- I got a special job for you.

334
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,135
- I don't do special jobs.

335
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,504
- Not even for big money?

336
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,706
- How much we talking?

337
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,442
- 20 grand.

338
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:07,445
- I just told you i
don't do special jobs.

339
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,679
- 50 then.

340
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,114
- You're just going to
throw numbers at me now?

341
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,515
- Yea, I'm serious.

342
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,451
- Well then again,
respectfully Roy,

343
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,052
I'm going to have to decline.

344
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,521
- Well how about
a respectable...

345
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:19,089
100 grand?

346
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,093
- Thanks for the drink.

347
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,999
- 200 grand.

348
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:36,607
Ah, now I've got your attention.

349
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:37,875
- Are you serious?

350
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,177
- I don't fuck around Jimmy.

351
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,986
- What kind of job we talking?

352
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,921
- Just another boost.

353
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,491
You got five minutes
to steal a car,

354
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,060
containing some
really valuable cargo.

355
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,896
It's going down
in broad daylight.

356
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,131
All you got to do,
bring me the car.

357
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:04,201
Don't ask any questions,
and that's it.

358
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,036
- That's it?

359
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,906
- Yep, that's it.

360
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:12,810
- Two fifty.

361
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:15,946
- I got to make a call.

362
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,248
- What for?

363
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:20,818
- Now I know your price.

364
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:37,668
- Tommy, you mind?

365
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,751
You know who I am?

366
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,121
- You must be Lorenzo.

367
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,991
But you don't look sick to me.

368
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,226
- That's because I'm not.

369
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,695
At least not in the body.

370
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,697
Maybe in the mind.

371
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:10,067
- I thought this was all
about you needing a kidney.

372
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,203
- What's your name kid?

373
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,005
- Jimmy.

374
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,907
- What do you do Jimmy?

375
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,309
What's your thing?

376
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,778
- I boost cars.

377
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,781
- And how did you wind
up working for Austin?

378
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,784
- I don't work for nobody.

379
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,185
- And yet, here we are.

380
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,658
It's amazing isn't it?

381
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,927
How crystal clear
a situation becomes

382
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,063
when you're looking at
it from the outside?

383
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,999
- It's a matter
of point of view.

384
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,167
- Exactly.

385
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,136
We're animals.

386
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,038
That's part of our conundrum.

387
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:50,941
Greed serves us
very well in nature,

388
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,944
but in the human world,
we have our intellect

389
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,245
to tell us otherwise.

390
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:59,116
- If you were me, you would
have done the same thing.

391
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,352
- Hard to say.

392
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,784
You know I have to
kill you, right?

393
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:37,921
- You don't have to do anything.

394
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:41,191
- I didn't get to be in this
position by being merciful.

395
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,360
- Mercy?

396
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,829
Is that what we're
talking about?

397
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,698
- If you were in my position,

398
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,299
you'd do the same thing.

399
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:52,269
- Hard to say.

400
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:55,706
- How old are you kid?

401
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,274
- 26.

402
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:58,976
- Jesus.

403
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,112
When I was 26, i
lived in Chelsea.

404
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,182
- Why'd you come here?

405
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:07,384
- Because I knew
that I would have to

406
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:09,286
burn some people
if I wanted to get

407
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,988
where I wanted to go.

408
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:13,190
Or, move somewhere else,

409
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,425
and take what was mine.

410
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:15,726
I chose the latter.

411
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,931
- Makes sense, but why L.A.?

412
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,766
It's the weather, right?

413
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,269
I'm from Detroit, you
ever been to midwest?

414
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:26,804
It's fucking cold.

415
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,274
- First I went to New York.

416
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,276
But the guineas run that town.

417
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,044
Also, cold.

418
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,047
After a few years,
i came out to L.A.,

419
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,750
and I knew right
away, I'd hit it.

420
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,220
- How'd you know?

421
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,457
- Back then, my
main thing was blow,

422
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:49,460
and this bitch ran all
the coke from Mexico.

423
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,029
Ruthless cunt named graciela.

424
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,965
Bat shit crazy, that broad.

425
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:57,935
And good looking
too, huge titties.

426
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,504
But if she even thought
you'd crossed her,

427
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:03,874
she'd have you burned
alive, cut out your eyes,

428
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,409
and chop off your dick.

429
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,011
That's the funny
thing about people,

430
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:10,314
you can deify them, but
that the end of the day,

431
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,483
their flesh is just
as soft and fragile

432
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:14,251
as a baby girl's.

433
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:17,888
- Something tells me things
didn't end well for graciela.

434
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:23,260
- She fell victim to her vanity.

435
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,996
And then I put a
gun under her chin

436
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:27,531
and blew her fucking head off.

437
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:32,069
Men get a bad wrap,
but it never ceases

438
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:34,471
to surprise me, how
stupid a woman becomes

439
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:36,507
when she sees a big dick.

440
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,780
Just like that, pow,
no more graciela,

441
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,515
and I'm running the
coke from Mexico.

442
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:47,351
You think the
wetbacks give a fuck

443
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:48,986
who's running the shit?

444
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:51,855
They don't, trust me, as
long as you're consistent.

445
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,364
You ever been in love?

446
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,100
- What?

447
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:05,836
- You ever been in love?

448
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:08,438
- Sure I have.

449
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:11,108
- Tell me about it.

450
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,081
- First time was Sarah madson.

451
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,518
She was a couple of
years older than me.

452
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,254
She lived up the street.

453
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,158
When I was 16, we hooked up.

454
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,494
Spent the summer together.

455
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,463
Used to pick her up in my truck,

456
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,965
and we'd sleep under
that stars at this lake

457
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:36,333
near my home town.

458
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,169
- Was she beautiful?

459
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,439
- Yea.

460
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,943
- So that's it?

461
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,511
Just Sarah?

462
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,116
- And my girl Sherry.

463
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,085
- Sherry?

464
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:57,454
- Yea, my girl shereen.

465
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,557
- Tell me about her.

466
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,127
- She's different.

467
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:06,463
She's special.

468
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,569
I can't figure it out.

469
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,638
She never asks me for much.

470
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:19,476
She maintains this, distance.

471
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,113
I tell her I love
her all the time

472
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:25,015
'cause honestly I do, but.

473
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,324
- But what?

474
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,160
- I don't know, nothing
man, it's hard to explain.

475
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,495
What do you care anyway?

476
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:44,401
- All my life, I've
spent avoiding love.

477
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:48,572
I've had a few meaningful
relationships, but

478
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,008
when it comes to women,

479
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,111
friends, family, in
our line of work,

480
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,913
it's best to keep it lean.

481
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:58,649
Loved ones become...

482
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,452
Like blind spots.

483
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,659
I have a daughter, Jimmy.

484
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:10,594
Sierra.

485
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,262
She's seven.

486
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,598
Never loved her
mother, but, the moment

487
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,199
I laid eyes on my little girl,

488
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,935
my world flipped.

489
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,005
Except for Tommy,
i kept her a secret

490
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,574
from my entire organization.

491
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,411
The only reason I'm telling you,

492
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:29,713
is that she's the one
who's dying, not me.

493
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,049
And I need your help
to save her life.

494
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,988
- This whole thing's
about a little girl?

495
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,191
A little girl, and
a blood disease.

496
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,661
It's ironic really.

497
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,232
All the energy I expended
trying to keep her a secret,

498
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:53,704
and now, apparently,
it's the very same thing

499
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,539
that's brought us
to this unfortunate

500
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,607
and somewhat
impossible situation.

501
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:01,311
- Why should I believe you?

502
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:03,647
- You said it
yourself, look at me.

503
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,215
I'm as healthy as a horse.

504
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,185
Now I'm going to
level with you Jimmy.

505
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,621
Because we're running
fucking short on time,

506
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,457
and we could chat
here all night.

507
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,160
Even if the kidney is intact,

508
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:20,998
she still has only a
70% chance of it taking.

509
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,234
I'm not going to
sit here and make up

510
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,069
some elaborate lie about how

511
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:28,305
if you help me, i
will let you go.

512
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,374
You fucked me, Jimmy.

513
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,509
And I know you didn't mean it,

514
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,211
but you did it anyway.

515
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,612
And now you have
to pay the price.

516
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:37,681
So, this is going to go down

517
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,750
one of either two ways.

518
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,352
One, you're going
to tell me where

519
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,022
the kidney is, and
when I have it,

520
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,623
Tommy here, is going
to put a bullet

521
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,191
through your heart.

522
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,293
Or, you don't tell
me where it is,

523
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,696
and I have one of my
less civilized guys

524
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,097
go to work on you.

525
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:00,704
- What if I set
everything right?

526
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,043
- Jimmy, I have my reputation.

527
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,677
- So that's it?

528
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:11,681
- That's it.

529
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,834
- Although I myself am not
a violent man, Lorenzo,

530
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,670
I understand people like you.

531
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,706
So before I agree to anything,

532
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,708
here are my terms.

533
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,811
I need two things.

534
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:42,679
One,

535
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:44,714
I want 150k.

536
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,117
For my girl shereen.

537
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,518
Put her brother through college,

538
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,753
take care of her for a while.

539
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,689
And two,

540
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,092
you got to let me go
for a couple hours.

541
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,829
I'll bring you back the
kidney, that's a promise.

542
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,798
But I need some time.

543
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:05,302
- You know I can't
do that Jimmy.

544
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:06,670
- Just hear me out.

545
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,673
Like I said, I understand
people like you.

546
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,641
I know that you'll find
the thing that I love most

547
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,477
and destroy it if i
try to skip town or

548
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:14,845
do anything stupid.

549
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:18,148
And I don't value
my life that much,

550
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:20,684
I never have.

551
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,122
But just so we're clear,
I'm not asking you.

552
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:26,523
I'm telling you.

553
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:28,825
I need a little time.

554
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,315
- Jimmy, what the fuck man?

555
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,584
- I need your help, I'm in deep.

556
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,521
- This is bad.

557
00:35:58,524 --> 00:35:59,890
This is really bad.

558
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:01,658
- I know.

559
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,827
I got caught up in this
shit and it's all fucked up.

560
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,362
- What shit?

561
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:07,430
Buy, sell organs on
the black market shit?

562
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,832
- No, it's not my thing, it's.

563
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,233
- Then what is your thing?

564
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,169
- I boost cars!

565
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,375
- I always knew you were
into some shady shit man,

566
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:19,743
but this is serious.

567
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:20,911
- I know!

568
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,613
- That kidney
belongs to somebody

569
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,248
and they're going to die
if they don't get it.

570
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,183
- I know.

571
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,552
- Then what the fuck?

572
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,789
- I was hired to steal
this car for big money.

573
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,191
I didn't know it
was in the trunk,

574
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,592
I knew it was valuable,
i figured it was drugs.

575
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:36,860
- And?

576
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,795
- And during the boost
some guy shows up

577
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,697
and puts a gun in my
face and I stab him man,

578
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,632
I stab him in the neck
with a screwdriver.

579
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,337
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,

580
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:48,972
you stabbed a guy?

581
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:50,707
- It was self defense!

582
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:54,311
- Look, Jimmy, that's murder.

583
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,645
- What are you doing?

584
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:57,981
- I'm a cop man.

585
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,749
I know that we got a history,

586
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,451
but I got to take you in.

587
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:02,986
- Take me in?

588
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:04,321
I called you 'cause
i need you help!

589
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:07,324
- Put your hands on your head.

590
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,226
- Are you serious right now?

591
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:12,429
Friendship, loyalty, does
that mean anything to you?

592
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:13,663
We're practically family!

593
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,699
- I know Jimmy.

594
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,235
But I'm not one of
your lotus brothers

595
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,337
and I certainly won't be
an accessory to murder.

596
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,938
Now put your hands
behind your head!

597
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,006
- No.

598
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,652
Come on.

599
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,289
You made me do it man, I'm
not going to shoot you.

600
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,426
I called you 'cause
i need your help

601
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,328
and no one in this fucking
town's got my back.

602
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:48,965
These guys want to kill me,
bad guys want to kill me.

603
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,635
So you can either help me
survive the next 24 hours,

604
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,470
and be part of the
solution, or not,

605
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,038
and then you're just
another part of the problem.

606
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:59,042
- Jimmy I'm a cop man.

607
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:02,912
This could cost me my badge.

608
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,682
This is my career.

609
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,917
- Then forget I ever called you.

610
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,021
- Jimmy I'm sorry man.

611
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:12,289
- Fuck you Clyde.

612
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:20,830
- Jimmy wait!

613
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:30,540
- Boys!

614
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,042
- Shut the fuck up Roy.

615
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,318
Roy?

616
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,719
Roy?

617
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,054
Roy?

618
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:44,921
- The fuck?

619
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:46,423
- Roy listen to me.

620
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,859
One of my guys got
stabbed in the neck today,

621
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:53,063
with a screwdriver,
during your pickup.

622
00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:54,597
- You mean your pickup!

623
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:59,703
- Listen, our personal
stuff aside Roy,

624
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:02,072
I trusted you again
and you have fucked me.

625
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,574
So you got about 30
seconds to start talking,

626
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:07,544
or I am going to make
your life miserable, huh?

627
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:08,411
- I don't know anything!

628
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:09,079
- Sledge.

629
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,815
You like to talk Roy,
everybody in town

630
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:15,085
knows that you like to
talk, so talk to me.

631
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,020
Huh?

632
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,488
- Hey, I don't know
what you're talking--

633
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,955
- goddammit I don't
get people like you!

634
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,424
You know what, you
just keep digging

635
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:22,592
deeper and deeper right?

636
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,027
You just won't look,

637
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,028
grab his hand.

638
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:28,031
You know what infuriates me?

639
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,899
Is that think you're so smart,

640
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,534
but you're not Roy,
and on top of that,

641
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,937
you're a horrible liar, so
all that ends up happening,

642
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:37,540
is you waste important
people's valuable time,

643
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,843
with all of your bullshit, huh?

644
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,511
- Wait, wait,
wait, what's he doing?

645
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,012
- Every
time you lie to me,

646
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,481
I'm going to rip out
one of your fucking

647
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:45,815
fingernails, okay?

648
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:46,983
So start talking!

649
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,151
- Okay I'll tell you
everything I know!

650
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:49,786
Wait, wait, wait!

651
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,154
Okay, I'll tell you, I'll
tell you everything I know.

652
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:55,658
Okay, word is, this
coked up kid, Austin.

653
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,026
He found out about the package.

654
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,745
He must have thought
that it was like,

655
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:00,463
a load of blow, because
that's his deal.

656
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,465
Hey, hey, he lives in Vernon.

657
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,435
- I know who Austin is Roy.

658
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,771
But what that doesn't
account for is how

659
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:10,073
Austin knew about the package,

660
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,474
unless you told him!

661
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:14,477
- I swear to god, i
didn't say a thing!

662
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,113
He deals to the
Armenians, and he knows

663
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,648
all the real border borthers!

664
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,949
They must have
fond out something!

665
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,050
I didn't say a thing.

666
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:24,954
I swear.

667
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,065
- That is a great story Roy.

668
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,500
That is a great story.

669
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,886
You know?

670
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:41,870
I guess a half truth is better
than no truth at all, so.

671
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:46,009
I'm going to pay you for
that info, thank you.

672
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:48,778
But you still owe me one.

673
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,017
I'm going to call you.

674
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,085
Get your money for you, okay?

675
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:05,962
- God damnit!

676
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:11,468
- Listen, I'm going to need you
to start from the beginning.

677
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:13,102
I'm all ears.

678
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,972
But if you want my help,

679
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,641
I need to know everything, okay?

680
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:23,079
- I don't know where to begin.

681
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,852
- What about the guy that
put a gun up to your head

682
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:30,086
in the parking lot?

683
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:32,055
Did he say anything?

684
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,757
- He asked me who
i was working for.

685
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,962
He mentioned Lorenzo.

686
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,631
- He said "Lorenzo?"

687
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,568
Oh shit.

688
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:48,004
He must be talking
about Lorenzo champs.

689
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,606
- Who's that?

690
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:54,177
- He's a big time gangster.

691
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,981
Runs a lot of operations
in and out of L.A.

692
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,250
He's our west
coast kingpin, man.

693
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,586
You know, we've been trying to
nail him down for years, but.

694
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:04,521
- But what?

695
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:08,258
- He's good Jimmy.

696
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,226
He's real good.

697
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,696
All of his businesses
are legit now.

698
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:14,898
Except for the coke.

699
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:18,835
- So what's he
want a kidney for?

700
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,870
- Who knows man?

701
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,140
People pay a lot of
money for the shit.

702
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:26,209
- I just keep thinking
about that guy

703
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,877
in the parking lot man.

704
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,913
I didn't have a choice,
you got to believe me.

705
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:33,116
- Oh I believe you.

706
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,286
Now I need you to tell me

707
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:39,222
exactly what it is

708
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,291
that you want me to do.

709
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,577
- You must be Jimmy.

710
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,078
Come on in, have seat.

711
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:14,223
You don't need that
pistol, cowboy.

712
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:15,592
- I'll be the judge of that.

713
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:17,694
- We're on the same side.

714
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,731
So where's this box?

715
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:22,932
I want to see this thing.

716
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,102
- It ain't far.

717
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,770
Where's my money?

718
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,640
- You'll get your money when
you deliver the package.

719
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,275
So if there's someone
you need to call,

720
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,643
now would be a good time.

721
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:35,111
- No, we'll wait
'till Roy gets here,

722
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,813
then I make that call,
and I decide how this

723
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:38,348
is going to work together.

724
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:40,049
- Okie dokie.

725
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:42,752
I'm crystal by the way.

726
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:46,356
Your services are
much appreciated.

727
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:48,658
Roy spoke very highly of you.

728
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,093
- That a fact?

729
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:52,962
- So you thirsty?

730
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:55,031
Care for a tasty beverage?

731
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,069
Or maybe a bump?

732
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:01,771
- No thanks, I had a
pretty rough morning.

733
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,241
- Yea, I heard about that.

734
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:08,344
Sorry.

735
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,948
Could you please stop
pointing that at me?

736
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,751
I'm a girl, it's rude.

737
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,989
- So how
do you know Roy?

738
00:44:22,394 --> 00:44:24,093
Everyone knows Roy.

739
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:25,428
- Wasn't he supposed
to be here by now?

740
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:28,364
- Dude, relax, you're tense.

741
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,102
You're kind of cute though.

742
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:36,239
Where you from?

743
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,240
- Detroit.

744
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,210
- Yea, I can see that.

745
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:42,945
You kind of got that whole

746
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:45,081
trashy urban guy thing going.

747
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:46,949
- Yea, where you from?

748
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:50,420
- The hills.

749
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,157
Oh, do you want one?

750
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:58,394
Mellow the fuck out!

751
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,229
You just made a
shit ton of money,

752
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,198
and as soon as you
deliver your package,

753
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,400
all's going to end well for you.

754
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:09,439
How about that drink?

755
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,075
- I don't like this,
you're stalling!

756
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,042
- Excuse me?

757
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,343
- Where's my fucking money?

758
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:17,313
- I don't like your
tone Jimmy from Detroit.

759
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:18,665
- Well I almost
got killed earlier,

760
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,016
so don't really give
a shit what you think.

761
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:21,217
Now where's my fucking money?

762
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,420
- Alright, you
left me no choice.

763
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:26,355
- What are you doing?

764
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:28,424
- Helping you relax.

765
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:41,270
You really are new
at this, aren't you?

766
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:46,342
Now take one more
step, and I'll shoot.

767
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:48,010
Baby!

768
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:49,512
You can come out now!

769
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:34,957
- What?

770
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:37,360
- Nothing.

771
00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:42,398
- Have a soft spot for the kid?

772
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:45,168
- Yea, I guess so.

773
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,039
- What was I supposed to do?

774
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:51,541
Let him go?

775
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:53,509
- No, I don't know.

776
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,313
It just, this doesn't
feel right, you know?

777
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,548
- It happens.

778
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,448
- Yea, but not like
this, and when the kid

779
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,050
did the right thing Lorenzo.

780
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,955
- Maybe in the end,

781
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:08,124
he got mixed up with
the wrong people.

782
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,892
Roy, that weirdo coke head.

783
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:11,394
- Austin.

784
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:14,063
- Nobody with half a brain
would work for that guy.

785
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:16,465
- Yea, I don't think he
was working with Austin.

786
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:19,435
I mean, Roy maybe, but
he didn't know Austin

787
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,970
from a hole in the
wall, I mean that guy

788
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,504
was cutting his face up
when we went in there.

789
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:45,328
- Jesus Christ.

790
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,197
- It's you.

791
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:53,936
- What the fuck is
the matter with you Austin?

792
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:58,608
- Are you really going
to lecture me old man?

793
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:02,445
- Look, what's up with
the sense of entitlement?

794
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:04,113
Huh?

795
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:05,514
I mean, didn't we
talk about this?

796
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:06,649
One day I'm going to be too old

797
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:08,618
and too tired to deal
with this bullshit?

798
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,654
And then it was going
to be Austin's time.

799
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:13,656
Right, but you
couldn't wait, huh?

800
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:16,259
You just insist on
disrespecting me

801
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:19,328
over and over and over again.

802
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,230
- Disrespecting you?

803
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:24,500
I'm just trying to
expand my business.

804
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:26,269
If you were in my shoes,
you would be doing

805
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:28,271
the exact same thing.

806
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,607
- Fair enough.

807
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,577
However, if I want someone dead,

808
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,046
I get them dead, and
i make damn well sure

809
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:39,215
they know it was me, that
wanted them that way.

810
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:40,616
You idiots, you get
involved in shit without

811
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:43,619
any concept of cause and effect.

812
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:48,057
- Wow, you...

813
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:51,694
Do realize we're talking
about drug trafficking?

814
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:54,597
Transporting human organs
on the black market

815
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,531
and murder?

816
00:48:56,367 --> 00:49:00,002
This isn't sicily circa 1940.

817
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:02,305
We're not in the godfather.

818
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:04,607
Some stupid gangster movie.

819
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,310
Okay, I saw an opportunity.

820
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,445
It's that simple.

821
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:14,517
And when Lorenzo's body is
drained and cold in the earth,

822
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:18,521
no one is going to gove
a shit how it happened.

823
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,228
- I guess you
didn't see all the

824
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,497
guys in nice suits
with huge guns.

825
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:32,535
Okay.

826
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:33,569
I'm going to explain it to you.

827
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:36,272
There's a Gulf here,
there's a divide.

828
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:37,740
A great divide, if you will.

829
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,543
On the one side you
got classy gentlemen,

830
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:43,212
that get nice
things, cars, houses.

831
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:46,148
Beautiful women,
big bank accounts.

832
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:48,150
Fillet mignon.

833
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,720
Manicured lawns, and we
get to have those things

834
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:52,655
because well, we
live by a creed.

835
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:55,024
A sense of civility, right?

836
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:56,692
And then on the other
side, there's you.

837
00:49:58,396 --> 00:49:59,695
You're a fuck up, man.

838
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,097
You're a psychopath.

839
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:03,499
You make bad decisions,
both personally,

840
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:06,569
and businesswise, that
affect other people.

841
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:09,005
You have no reverence
for the game

842
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:10,439
and you played it wrong.

843
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:12,308
You're lost in the woods
without a compass Austin,

844
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,176
and do you know
where that gets you?

845
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,714
- Lorenzo doesn't
have the kidney.

846
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,717
Okay, and time's
running out, right, huh?

847
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:25,654
Jimmy here is
working with a cop.

848
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:29,458
And he's the one who
has the package, so.

849
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:30,593
- Is that right?

850
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:34,764
- That's right.

851
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,132
Ask him.

852
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,400
- Is that true kid?

853
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:45,775
- You really going
to shoot me Tommy?

854
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:49,478
Wouldn't Lorenzo
rather whack the guy

855
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,780
who sold him out?

856
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:52,715
That would make sense to me.

857
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:03,592
- Austin, you are a
tragic character in this

858
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:05,394
play of fools, brother.

859
00:51:06,464 --> 00:51:07,663
- How's that?

860
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:10,699
- Because you played it wrong.

861
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:15,271
- Killing me,

862
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:17,540
would be bad for business.

863
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,409
I move too much product.

864
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:25,614
- That's true.

865
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:28,684
However, that's why
these guys are here.

866
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:34,623
Sledge.

867
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:37,593
- No, no!

868
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:38,861
No!

869
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:40,362
You don't have to do this!

870
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:41,430
Tommy, no!

871
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:42,765
Baby!

872
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:44,700
No!

873
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,738
- You were just too eager.

874
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,282
Will you untie the kid?

875
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,183
Let's get the fuck out of here.

876
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:10,559
- So, no more Austin.

877
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,495
- Yea, good riddance.

878
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:14,430
Wish I'd taken care of the
whacko a long time ago.

879
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,466
- These things play out Tommy,

880
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,634
that's just the way it is.

881
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,202
- No, I know, but
i don't like it.

882
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,769
I mean Roy's the one
that made this mess.

883
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,509
- He wanted the guy whacked,

884
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,644
just think of this as part
of the payment process.

885
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,579
- But even if that's true,

886
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:31,847
what, we're just happy
to have the Armenians

887
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:33,549
do Roy's dirty work?

888
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:34,717
- Doesn't matter now.

889
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:39,388
- Alright, so let me
get this straight.

890
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,340
Even thought you and I both know

891
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:42,857
that it was Roy
that sold us out,

892
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,829
you're not thinking
what I'm thinking?

893
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:48,831
- No Tommy.

894
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,768
You know we can't touch him.

895
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,639
This'll blow the lid
off the whole thing.

896
00:52:57,775 --> 00:52:59,241
Got a lot of things on my mind,

897
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,708
the last thing I need
is some bigger problem

898
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:01,777
south of the border.

899
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:02,945
- Come on.

900
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:04,747
- This isn't open
for discussion!

901
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:08,184
- Alright.

902
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:10,953
How's she doing?

903
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,190
- We'll see.

904
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:19,455
- Jimmy.

905
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,657
What the fuck happened
to your face man?

906
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:22,658
- Where is it?

907
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,726
- It's in the kitchen.

908
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:24,960
- If I'm not back later,

909
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:27,730
you need to give this to
my girl shereen, okay?

910
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:31,800
Here's her address.

911
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:33,969
Promise me you'll
give it to her!

912
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:36,672
- Jesus.

913
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:38,140
- Promise me!

914
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,607
- Jesus, I promise
man, I promise!

915
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,019
- Take care of this.

916
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:53,916
- What would you do with

917
00:55:53,918 --> 00:55:54,983
a few hundred grand, baby?

918
00:55:56,821 --> 00:55:57,986
- What?

919
00:55:58,489 --> 00:55:59,655
- What
would you do with a

920
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:01,690
few hundred grand,
if you go it today?

921
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:03,759
Or tomorrow?

922
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:06,995
- I don't know.

923
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:08,997
Put it down on a house, I guess.

924
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:12,568
I have no idea, why?

925
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:13,936
- Just wondering.

926
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:17,940
- I would put some
money away for

927
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:20,075
Mickey's college, i
would definitely do that.

928
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:23,912
- I would start a lot.

929
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:26,915
- What, like a parking lot?

930
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,650
- No, like
a used car lot.

931
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:30,052
I would buy and sell cars.

932
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,291
Maybe I'd take you on a trip.

933
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:36,625
I hear Pontiac, Michigan's
beautiful this time of year.

934
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:37,960
- Let's go
to the east coast.

935
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:38,827
- Let's go.

936
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,999
Mm, this bacon's so good baby.

937
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:45,834
- You like it?

938
00:56:46,437 --> 00:56:47,970
- I'm in love with it.

939
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:49,938
Almost as much as you.

940
00:56:51,142 --> 00:56:52,040
- You don't need money when

941
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:53,809
bacon makes you so happy.

942
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:55,944
- Damn right.

943
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:01,984
I was going down
to alvera street,

944
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:03,752
and I saw it and
i thought of you.

945
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,721
You like it?

946
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,189
- I love it.

947
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:16,698
- What?

948
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:18,133
- Nothing.

949
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:20,169
- Then what's the problem?

950
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:22,805
- It makes me feel
uncomfortable when you

951
00:57:22,807 --> 00:57:24,173
look at me like that.

952
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,543
- You're going to have
to explain that to me.

953
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:36,051
- I love you Jimmy.

954
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:39,121
I do.

955
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:42,658
I just.

956
00:57:43,928 --> 00:57:45,060
- Just what?

957
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:51,133
- Let me tell you a story.

958
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,440
When I was a little girl,

959
00:57:57,441 --> 00:57:58,941
I went to visit my
family in Mexico.

960
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:02,644
And that summer
they had this goat.

961
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:05,581
On the farm.

962
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:09,017
I loved little Billy
more than anything.

963
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:11,053
He was black and
white, and used to

964
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:12,821
follow me everywhere.

965
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:15,891
I was only five
years old, and I'd

966
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:17,593
never been on a farm before.

967
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:19,862
So I didn't understand
that they would

968
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:22,531
raise a goat once a
year, to be harvested

969
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:25,167
in the fall, for the
festival to make berria.

970
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:28,103
One day, I was
called to the corral,

971
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:29,705
as everyone else in the family.

972
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:32,641
We gather around, and,

973
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:35,277
we watched as my
grandfather slaughtered him.

974
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:38,814
Being so young, i
had no idea this was

975
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,249
going to happen, so...

976
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,519
I was...

977
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:45,187
Desperate and I started to cry.

978
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:48,657
As my grandfather
cut his throat.

979
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:52,127
When he heard my
cries, the poor Billy

980
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:54,830
became distressed
and started to panic,

981
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:58,100
and struggle for his life.

982
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:01,203
- He was being slaughtered.

983
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:03,105
- No.

984
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,108
That wasn't it.

985
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,547
Everyone else,
including the goat,

986
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:14,049
up to that point,
were extremely calm.

987
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:17,052
It was actually
me who scared him.

988
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:20,656
My Tia grabbed my hand and said,

989
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:21,890
"let him go."

990
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:24,192
"Your fears are scaring him."

991
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:26,995
"His life was not meant for you,

992
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:28,230
"he doesn't belong to you."

993
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:31,166
"His life was meant for
a different purpose."

994
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:35,070
"He gives his body
and blood to us,

995
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,838
"and we thank him
by honoring him

996
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,106
"for his sacrifice."

997
00:59:41,312 --> 00:59:43,245
At first I was confused.

998
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,049
But then I understood.

999
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:53,121
And my empathy evaporated,

1000
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,591
and I realized she was right.

1001
00:59:57,895 --> 00:59:59,628
It was me who was
keeping him here.

1002
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:05,167
- So what did you do?

1003
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,248
- I let him go.

1004
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:32,894
Thank you.

1005
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,264
- Hey man, I got to
ask you something.

1006
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,133
- Hm?

1007
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:13,702
- You consider pizza
hut a pizzeria?

1008
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,174
- I don't know.

1009
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,110
- I'm asking you a question.

1010
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:23,812
Yes or no?

1011
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,390
- No, I don't think
pizza hut is a pizzeria.

1012
01:01:35,993 --> 01:01:36,958
- No?

1013
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:39,027
They serve fucking pizza.

1014
01:01:39,263 --> 01:01:40,462
- Okay.

1015
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:42,330
You know, I went
there the other day

1016
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:43,899
and got in an argument
with the waitress.

1017
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:45,333
I asked for two slices.

1018
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:48,270
She says, "no."

1019
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:51,273
- I don't think they
do slices at pizza hut.

1020
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:52,340
- That's not the point.

1021
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:55,043
The point is, i
asked for two slices,

1022
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:57,779
she goes, "what do we
look like, a pizzeria?"

1023
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,715
Now tell me that
wouldn't piss you off.

1024
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,719
- Got to work on your
anger management.

1025
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:05,387
- Yea, anger management.

1026
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:06,388
- Breathe.

1027
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,758
- Take it in, let it out.

1028
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:10,992
Pop her in the face.

1029
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:16,131
What's the plan here, man?

1030
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:21,203
- Keri's going to pull
up, drop the car off,

1031
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:24,139
he's going to be
under the wheel well,

1032
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:25,741
package is in the back.

1033
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,342
- Under the wheel well,
or on the wheel well?

1034
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:28,911
- It's
under the wheel well

1035
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,479
in like a, little
hide-a-key thing.

1036
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:32,013
- The fuck's a hide-a-key?

1037
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,815
- Know what a hide-a-key is?

1038
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:35,917
Little fucking black
box, got magnets on it?

1039
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:37,419
Slidey door, key goes in there,

1040
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,521
your stick it under the
car, in case you leave.

1041
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:43,291
- A fucking hide-a-key.

1042
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:45,861
- I'll find it.

1043
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:47,129
- Got those hide-a-keys
that got those

1044
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:48,831
little fake rocks, you
never seen those shits?

1045
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,532
- Dude, I'm from Brooklyn,
we got no fake rocks.

1046
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:53,969
I'll find it though.

1047
01:03:01,311 --> 01:03:02,544
- Can't see anything.

1048
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,312
- Just give it a minute.

1049
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:31,540
Alright, go.

1050
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:40,549
Fucking hide-a-key,

1051
01:03:40,551 --> 01:03:42,417
don't know what a
fucking hide-a key is.

1052
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:20,956
The fuck?

1053
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:24,159
No, no!

1054
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:25,894
No, no, no!

1055
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:27,162
Oh fuck, no!

1056
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:33,435
Hey!

1057
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:34,970
You, you!

1058
01:04:34,972 --> 01:04:35,904
Motherfucker!

1059
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:33,588
- Hello?

1060
01:06:34,758 --> 01:06:36,124
- Who is this?

1061
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:39,394
- Who's this?

1062
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:41,396
- This is the guy
that knows that you're

1063
01:06:41,398 --> 01:06:44,599
speaking on a dead man's
cell phone, that's who.

1064
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:48,169
Some stunt you pulled
back there kid.

1065
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,339
- What do you want?

1066
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,509
Big Tommy?

1067
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,747
- Alright, listen.

1068
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,616
Before you and I get
off on the wrong foot,

1069
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,151
I'm going to give
you an opportunity

1070
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:04,486
to set this right.

1071
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:06,204
Under normal circumstances, that

1072
01:07:06,205 --> 01:07:07,755
wouldn't exist for someone
in your predicament.

1073
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:10,625
Right, but this
shit is personal.

1074
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,763
Keep in mind that the
man that I work for,

1075
01:07:14,765 --> 01:07:16,398
he's not going to
stop until you are

1076
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,067
cut into little tiny pieces.

1077
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:20,769
- You think I don't
know that already?

1078
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:21,736
- Well then what's it
going to take for you

1079
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:23,438
to bring me back the car?

1080
01:07:23,774 --> 01:07:25,440
- Don't you mean kidney?

1081
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:29,711
That's not going to happen
until I have my money.

1082
01:07:33,316 --> 01:07:35,216
- How much did they offer you?

1083
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,389
- 250 grand.

1084
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:44,359
- I'll match it.

1085
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:47,429
- Go on.

1086
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,699
- I want to know who hired you.

1087
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:55,637
- I'm not saying
anything until I have

1088
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:56,805
my insurance policy.

1089
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:01,142
- Well, you're going to
need more than that kid.

1090
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,182
- What do you mean?

1091
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:08,783
- It's going to take
more than a simple trade

1092
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:11,686
to set this straight, you
killed one of our guys.

1093
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,154
Alright?

1094
01:08:13,156 --> 01:08:14,389
That being said,
there's going to be

1095
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:16,424
a price on your head,
people are going to die.

1096
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:17,826
If you want to get this
straight, you and I,

1097
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:19,594
we're going to have
to work together

1098
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,596
so that means that we
will have to establish

1099
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,131
some trust.

1100
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:24,732
Alright?

1101
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:28,736
I want to know who hired you.

1102
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:37,378
- I'll call you back
in a half an hour.

1103
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,780
In the mean time,
you can talk to Roy.

1104
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,907
- Now I need you to tell me

1105
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:10,278
exactly what it is
that you want me to do.

1106
01:09:14,551 --> 01:09:15,884
- Nothing yet.

1107
01:09:15,886 --> 01:09:17,585
I just need the package.

1108
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:19,787
Some place safe
for my protection.

1109
01:09:20,457 --> 01:09:22,790
Just go home and hang
tight, and I'll call you.

1110
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:26,561
- Okay, but I thought
you wanted my help

1111
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:27,829
with these guys.

1112
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,666
- The only thing
i need now is for

1113
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:32,800
the package to be
some place safe with

1114
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:34,636
someone I can trust.

1115
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,505
Can you do that for me Clyde?

1116
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:42,877
- Yea.

1117
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:45,346
Yea, I can do that.

1118
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:47,749
- Then I need to
make a phone call.

1119
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:53,388
- I'm gonna call you,

1120
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:55,356
get your money for you, okay?

1121
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,393
Bye.

1122
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:02,530
That motherfucker.

1123
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:04,666
- Yea.

1124
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:06,568
What are you going
to to about it?

1125
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:11,739
- I'm a lead the kid there,

1126
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:13,341
and let him handle it.

1127
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:14,542
That's the plan.

1128
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:17,445
Here he is.

1129
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:20,215
You want your money, don't you?

1130
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:21,516
- Yea.

1131
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:22,684
- Then you're going to
have to go in there,

1132
01:10:22,686 --> 01:10:23,985
and you're going
to have to get it.

1133
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:26,588
Alright, that's the
deal we're making.

1134
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:30,358
Look, we'll be right behind you.

1135
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:32,860
Okay, as soon as the
Armenians get here,

1136
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:33,928
we're going to swoop in.

1137
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,338
- Baby?

1138
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,505
You can come out now.

1139
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,543
- You'll
only make it worse!

1140
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:03,024
Is it the pain?

1141
01:11:03,827 --> 01:11:06,761
Or the horror of being
maimed that's worse?

1142
01:11:08,999 --> 01:11:10,698
- You're a monster!

1143
01:11:12,636 --> 01:11:13,968
- I'm an artist.

1144
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,613
You know why I'm an artist?

1145
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:31,452
It's because the
lines you can draw.

1146
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:34,522
The layers of a person

1147
01:11:35,025 --> 01:11:36,724
you can peel away.

1148
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:37,992
Like an onion.

1149
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:41,529
If it's enough,

1150
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:43,031
you see steam

1151
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,833
rising off of them.

1152
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:49,771
All that heat.

1153
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:53,441
All that life.

1154
01:11:54,577 --> 01:11:55,910
Literally.

1155
01:11:57,047 --> 01:11:58,746
Evaporating.

1156
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:02,817
I feel its fever.

1157
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:07,722
- Help me!

1158
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:09,791
Help, help me!

1159
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:12,460
- You can scream all you want,

1160
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:16,764
nobody can hear you!

1161
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:23,805
Ready?

1162
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,073
Huh?

1163
01:12:25,075 --> 01:12:25,940
- Wait!

1164
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:26,874
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1165
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:27,742
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1166
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:28,743
- Baby, baby!

1167
01:12:28,745 --> 01:12:29,844
This is my favorite part.

1168
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:35,049
- Baby?

1169
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,357
- Gevorg, what the fuck?

1170
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,944
- What the fuck,
where were you guys?

1171
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,013
- We had to wait for the
cavalry to show up Jimmy.

1172
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:09,917
- So what's next,
what are we doing?

1173
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:12,120
- You're going to take
the money to Roy's.

1174
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:17,091
Look, I promised him
the money for the info.

1175
01:13:19,963 --> 01:13:21,796
Then we ripped his
fingernail out.

1176
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:25,733
Then I guess you could say that

1177
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,635
I needed an
insurance policy too.

1178
01:13:44,988 --> 01:13:46,087
Thank you.

1179
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,054
I appreciate it.

1180
01:13:47,056 --> 01:13:48,489
I'll call you later okay?

1181
01:13:48,992 --> 01:13:49,924
Thanks.

1182
01:14:03,072 --> 01:14:04,472
You alright with this, huh?

1183
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:11,913
- So basically I have
to convince this guy

1184
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:14,048
that I'm going to
give up my life,

1185
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,516
and give him the kidney?

1186
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,686
- Yea.

1187
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:21,022
Basically.

1188
01:14:23,026 --> 01:14:24,525
- What if he doesn't buy it?

1189
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,763
- Look Jimmy, just play it
like we talked about, okay?

1190
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:31,132
Assure him, reassure him.

1191
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:32,800
Convince him.

1192
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:35,837
- He's just going to
give me 150 grand?

1193
01:14:35,839 --> 01:14:38,072
- Yea, if you can convince him
that you're willing to die.

1194
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,074
I think he will, yes.

1195
01:14:44,948 --> 01:14:46,147
You can do this Jimmy.

1196
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,087
- And I don't value
my life that much,

1197
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:54,755
I never have.

1198
01:14:55,091 --> 01:14:56,591
But just so we're clear,

1199
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:57,892
I'm not asking you,

1200
01:14:58,061 --> 01:14:59,260
I'm telling you.

1201
01:14:59,262 --> 01:15:00,828
I need a little time.

1202
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:18,279
- He needs a little money,

1203
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:19,780
and you're going to drive him.

1204
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:23,117
- And we'll just meet back here?

1205
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:24,752
- Yea.
- Okay.

1206
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:27,255
We're going to let him keep it?

1207
01:15:29,192 --> 01:15:30,291
- What do you think?

1208
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,930
- I don't know, he
seems alright to me.

1209
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:40,067
And if he brings us the package.

1210
01:15:41,638 --> 01:15:43,170
- Shame it had to
go down like this.

1211
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:44,238
- Yea.

1212
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:51,646
Could have been any of
us back in the day, huh?

1213
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:53,981
- But it wasn't.

1214
01:15:57,854 --> 01:15:59,153
- Alright, well I should go.

1215
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,773
- If the kid,

1216
01:16:01,774 --> 01:16:03,324
so much as hints that
he's going to book,

1217
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:04,959
do him.

1218
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:06,027
- Okay.

1219
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:06,994
- You got two hours.

1220
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:09,196
I'll go get the money.

1221
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:20,975
- So you talked to your guy,

1222
01:16:20,977 --> 01:16:22,310
he knows what to do?

1223
01:16:22,946 --> 01:16:24,345
- I told him exactly what to do.

1224
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:27,715
- But I mean, you're confident?

1225
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:29,249
I mean you trust him that
he can do this, right?

1226
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:32,153
- He said he would.

1227
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:33,020
- Alright, but,
you know, this has

1228
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:34,188
got to look real Jimmy.

1229
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:35,289
If this is going
to work, you know,

1230
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:36,924
for both of us, okay?

1231
01:16:38,161 --> 01:16:39,927
- Don't worry, this
guy's a perfectionist.

1232
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:44,198
- He better be.

1233
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,392
- Here's her address.

1234
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:46,260
Promise me you'll
give it to her.

1235
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:48,863
- Jesus.
- Promise me!

1236
01:17:48,865 --> 01:17:50,865
- Jesus, I promise
man, I promise!

1237
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:21,429
- I don't have much time.

1238
01:18:23,066 --> 01:18:24,398
- Yo Jimmy, wait man!

1239
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,469
I got something I got
to say before you go.

1240
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,406
After my mother died,

1241
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:37,778
my father and I were never
really the same, you know?

1242
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:44,218
And I know that he saw
you as more of a son

1243
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,953
than he ever saw me.

1244
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:48,122
And that was hard.

1245
01:18:51,794 --> 01:18:54,395
I never got to say
goodbye to my father, man.

1246
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,935
And I know you did right
by him when he was sick.

1247
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:06,407
And I never got a chance
to thank you for that.

1248
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:11,412
So in case for some reason,

1249
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:14,882
I don't ever see you again,

1250
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:18,119
I love you man.

1251
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:34,435
You sure you're
going to be alright?

1252
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:36,537
You sure?

1253
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:37,872
- Yea, I'm sure.

1254
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:15,509
- Take care of this.

1255
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:33,828
- It's alright.

1256
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:36,363
You alright?

1257
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:57,451
You did good, come on.

1258
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:00,120
Come on!

1259
01:21:01,858 --> 01:21:03,290
Come on, walk it off.

1260
01:21:05,394 --> 01:21:06,293
Woo.

1261
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:08,495
Alright.

1262
01:21:59,982 --> 01:22:00,681
Ready?

1263
01:22:47,396 --> 01:22:48,329
Hey.

1264
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:55,169
You alright?

1265
01:22:56,105 --> 01:22:57,304
You did good.

1266
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,653
- So that's it?

1267
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:16,457
- Unless she dies
Jimmy, and then

1268
01:23:16,459 --> 01:23:17,758
I'm going to come find you.

1269
01:23:19,261 --> 01:23:20,227
- She won't.

1270
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:21,595
- Yea.

1271
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:25,099
But if she does.

1272
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,144
Oh my goodness.

1273
01:23:39,215 --> 01:23:40,381
You know Jimmy, you and I

1274
01:23:40,383 --> 01:23:41,382
actually made a
pretty good team.

1275
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:47,721
- Can I ask you something?

1276
01:23:48,124 --> 01:23:49,189
- Sure.

1277
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:52,059
- Why'd you want
to work with me?

1278
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,361
- I didn't.

1279
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:59,133
Jimmy, I did this for Sierra.

1280
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:03,704
- Lorenzo's little girl?

1281
01:24:08,511 --> 01:24:11,512
- Yea, Lorenzo's her
father,you know, but...

1282
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:16,450
She's my little girl.

1283
01:24:19,155 --> 01:24:20,320
- I see.

1284
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:24,558
- He wasn't lying, you know?

1285
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:25,759
He would have killed you Jimmy,

1286
01:24:25,761 --> 01:24:27,094
he would have killed you.

1287
01:24:27,096 --> 01:24:28,695
He wouldn't have
thought twice about it.

1288
01:24:28,697 --> 01:24:30,564
You know?

1289
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,432
But then we would have
lost the package and I...

1290
01:24:35,438 --> 01:24:36,804
I just, I...

1291
01:24:37,139 --> 01:24:38,405
I couldn't have that.

1292
01:24:40,276 --> 01:24:41,608
And I'm sure he gave
you a great performance

1293
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,710
when he was
interrogating you, but...

1294
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,549
Truth is, he is a
horrible father.

1295
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:52,853
- So you love her?

1296
01:25:05,634 --> 01:25:07,367
- Can't have kids of my own.

1297
01:25:11,674 --> 01:25:12,840
And it's not her
fault, you know?

1298
01:25:12,842 --> 01:25:14,308
It's not her fault that

1299
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:17,144
her father's a gangster,
and mom was a whore.

1300
01:25:19,815 --> 01:25:21,515
And she can say, you know?

1301
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:25,519
It's not her fault.

1302
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:31,759
I don't know Jimmy.

1303
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:32,659
There's no playbook
for this type of shit.

1304
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:39,766
I didn't like letting you walk,

1305
01:25:40,769 --> 01:25:43,303
after what you did to Lou.

1306
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:49,209
Like I said,
there's no playbook.

1307
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:52,513
All I know is that,

1308
01:25:52,515 --> 01:25:54,448
in this line of work, you...

1309
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:55,849
You make the guy that's
got the thing you want,

1310
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:57,417
you make him an ally.

1311
01:25:58,721 --> 01:25:59,887
Not an enemy.

1312
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:03,757
That's how I played it.

1313
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:10,814
- Well I hope you know that I

1314
01:26:10,815 --> 01:26:11,864
never would have taken
this job if I had

1315
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:13,901
known what the package was for.

1316
01:26:17,473 --> 01:26:18,839
- Doesn't matter now.

1317
01:26:27,816 --> 01:26:28,782
Here.

1318
01:26:37,826 --> 01:26:40,360
- Time to cash in
that insurance policy?

1319
01:26:42,932 --> 01:26:44,398
- Yea.

1320
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:48,569
I want you to call
me when it's done.

1321
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:50,871
Okay?

1322
01:26:58,714 --> 01:26:59,846
Hey Jimmy.

1323
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:04,818
You asked me, but...

1324
01:27:06,355 --> 01:27:07,821
Why'd you do it?

1325
01:27:12,361 --> 01:27:14,328
- It was the ultimate boost.

1326
01:27:20,636 --> 01:27:22,269
- You disappear kid.

1327
01:27:39,688 --> 01:27:40,821
- Back the fuck up!

1328
01:27:41,257 --> 01:27:42,489
Take a seat!

1329
01:27:42,858 --> 01:27:44,324
- Jimmy, Jimmy,
take it easy man!

1330
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:45,425
- Take it easy?

1331
01:27:45,995 --> 01:27:47,728
- Please, have a seat Jimmy.

1332
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:49,496
- I'm not sitting anymore today.

1333
01:27:49,498 --> 01:27:51,365
I don't want to talk,
i just want my money.

1334
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:52,899
Pick it up!

1335
01:27:53,969 --> 01:27:55,335
Open it up!

1336
01:27:59,475 --> 01:28:00,540
Shut it!

1337
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:02,843
- Please.

1338
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:04,711
Now, come on, Jimmy.

1339
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:05,879
- Fuck you.

1340
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,016
- Do you mind?

1341
01:28:09,885 --> 01:28:11,285
- Do it slow!

1342
01:28:14,857 --> 01:28:16,023
- You know I lied Jimmy.

1343
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:20,060
- No shit!

1344
01:28:20,062 --> 01:28:21,595
- About the Tequila.

1345
01:28:22,698 --> 01:28:23,864
It's really cheap.

1346
01:28:23,866 --> 01:28:25,499
- All tastes like shit to me.

1347
01:28:26,035 --> 01:28:28,435
- Okay, one last request, amigo.

1348
01:28:31,507 --> 01:28:32,873
How did we end up this way?

1349
01:28:34,843 --> 01:28:36,643
- I guess I got lucky.

1350
01:28:37,513 --> 01:28:38,912
- I don't believe in luck.

1351
01:28:39,581 --> 01:28:41,014
- You could use some by now.

1352
01:28:42,084 --> 01:28:43,550
- Hey you don't
have to do this man,

1353
01:28:43,552 --> 01:28:44,785
you got your money.

1354
01:28:44,787 --> 01:28:46,953
- And you almost got
me killed, twice!

1355
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:49,723
- Hey, it wasn't personal!

1356
01:28:49,725 --> 01:28:50,724
- How's that?

1357
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,092
- Lorenzo.

1358
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:54,361
Killed my cousin graciela.

1359
01:28:54,863 --> 01:28:57,331
This was my first
chance to get even.

1360
01:28:57,866 --> 01:28:59,900
- Why me, why the
bullshit story?

1361
01:29:01,904 --> 01:29:03,370
- I wanted to get rid of Austin.

1362
01:29:04,773 --> 01:29:06,940
I figured Lorenzo's
guys would kill him.

1363
01:29:07,376 --> 01:29:09,810
And I was hoping you'd
get away, and you did!

1364
01:29:09,812 --> 01:29:11,011
- You're a terrible liar.

1365
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,846
But it doesn't matter now.

1366
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:15,048
I'm not killing you for Lorenzo.

1367
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,384
He already thinks I'm dead.

1368
01:29:18,487 --> 01:29:19,953
- So Tommy gets his wish.

1369
01:29:20,656 --> 01:29:22,356
At the hands of a dead man.

1370
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:24,591
- These things play out.

1371
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,793
- That's why I like you Jimmy.

1372
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:29,096
'Cause you're smarter
than the average bear.

1373
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:31,898
But let me give you
a word of advice.

1374
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,066
For the future.

1375
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:36,970
You wear your heart
on you sleeve.

1376
01:29:38,907 --> 01:29:40,440
And that makes you weak.

1377
01:29:43,912 --> 01:29:46,046
- So my life was
worth 500 grand?

1378
01:29:46,982 --> 01:29:49,116
And now I'm buying it
back for a lot more.

1379
01:29:50,686 --> 01:29:53,053
- You would have done the
same thing in my position.

1380
01:29:54,056 --> 01:29:55,021
- Hard to say.

1381
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,125
- Salut Jimmy.

1382
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:00,093
- Salut Roy.

1383
01:30:13,409 --> 01:30:14,508
- Hello?

1384
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:16,576
- It's done.

1385
01:30:17,946 --> 01:30:20,414
- No, sorry, you got
the wrong number, bud.
