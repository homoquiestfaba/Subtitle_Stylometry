1
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,678
What's your first memory?

2
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,314
Here's mine, ready?

3
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,285
All my life, I knew I was
destined for one thing.

4
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:03,221
To be a great artist.

5
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,823
From the very beginning, I knew

6
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,892
exactly what my medium would be

7
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,461
and I knew, with every
fiber of my being

8
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,596
that... that my
creations were going

9
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,332
to be tremendous works of art.

10
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,734
They'd touch people in
the deepest of ways,

11
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,402
make them see
things differently,

12
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,638
see themselves differently.

13
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,640
Make them say to each other,

14
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:25,444
"this here, this
is truly great."

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,882
But somehow,
something, somewhere

16
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:37,255
along the way went, I
don't know... Wrong.

17
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:04,116
Herman!

18
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,084
It's 3:00 in the morning,
what are you doing?

19
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,353
Mom, I'm working!

20
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,150
Lady, I would just prefer to

21
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:39,851
show my work to
Ms. klein herself.

22
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,753
Look, if you want
Ms. klein to see it,

23
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,588
it has to go through me first.

24
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,791
That's just how it works.

25
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,029
Fine, okay.

26
00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:01,640
It's a commentary
on how our country's

27
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,643
eco-imperialist policies
directly correlate

28
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,612
to the rise of carbon monoxide
in the earth's atmosphere.

29
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,651
It's a mobile.

30
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,632
I'm making your favorite.

31
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,873
I think you spend too
much time down there.

32
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,943
You need to get out more.

33
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,478
I need to work.

34
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,313
What work?

35
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,582
You don't work.

36
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:44,783
If I had a job, then when

37
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,384
would I have time
for my art, mom?

38
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,721
Besides, making mobiles is the
only thing that I'm good at.

39
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,123
Maybe it's time you
found something else.

40
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,091
What do you want me to do, huh?

41
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,359
You want me to quit?

42
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,027
Oh, hermann.

43
00:04:57,296 --> 00:05:00,031
Bring me the skins,
will you, dear?

44
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,569
What about your uncle?

45
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,104
He can give you
some good advice.

46
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,639
Why don't you call him?

47
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,007
Uncle Felix?

48
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,110
Crazy uncle Felix, who
makes jewelry out of shells?

49
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,111
What?

50
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,045
Come on.

51
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,614
What "come on"?

52
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,083
He make beautiful earrings, see?

53
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,751
He doesn't even
make those himself.

54
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,887
He exploits these poor
villagers to do it.

55
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,722
He exploits them, he
pays them pennies,

56
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:27,526
and then he turns around and
he sells his art for hundreds.

57
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,793
He's a total hack.

58
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,395
You show respect.

59
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,964
Ever since your father died he
sent a check every Christmas.

60
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,299
He's a good man.

61
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,500
He's a hack.

62
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,868
Helps with the bills
more than you do.

63
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,103
I'm not calling him, okay?

64
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,772
I'm just saying for
your own good, hermann!

65
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,777
You know, you're not
getting any younger.

66
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,118
Can you crank, dear?

67
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,315
Hermann.

68
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:26,718
Joel, where's your piece?

69
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,888
- Not finished yet.
- Pfft.

70
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,556
I know what you're thinking.

71
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,259
You see, it's all part
of my new technique.

72
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:37,529
I call it "instantaneous art."

73
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,831
The whole notion of
the tortured artist

74
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,233
investing months in one piece.

75
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,604
It just seems so... Historic.

76
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,672
You don't have a piece, do you?

77
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,909
You ever been
struck by lightning?

78
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,945
Great art is like lightning.

79
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,250
It's effortless, only
takes an instant to create.

80
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,922
And when it hits you, wham!

81
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,660
Know what I mean?

82
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,106
Pretty pictures!
Pretty pictures!

83
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,641
Hiya, chief.

84
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,876
I didn't know you had

85
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,611
a showroom in this neighborhood.

86
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,213
I branched out.

87
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,614
Want me to try selling
some of your work?

88
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,549
You get a fair cut.

89
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:36,621
Yeah, I make real art,
not, uh, whatever this is.

90
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,191
Oh, I see, you make real art.

91
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,032
I ever tell you about
my friend Marlon?

92
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,102
Have a seat, chief.

93
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:56,641
Marlon was a painter,
poor son of a bitch.

94
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:01,713
He was convinced he
was the next kandinsky.

95
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,150
Only it turns out, he couldn't
paint worth half a damn.

96
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,786
I mean, it's plain to
everybody he stinks.

97
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,822
Only no one has the guts
to tell him, you know?

98
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:12,390
Sure.

99
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:16,094
So the guy struggles
his whole life.

100
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:21,132
Only it's not working,
he can't sell a thing.

101
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,702
Ate his insides out.

102
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,973
One day, he comes by talking
about some lizard he found.

103
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,608
He got obsessed with
the way they can

104
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,010
break off their tails, you know,

105
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,479
to escape from danger.

106
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,614
Survival mechanism.

107
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,085
Anyway, it must
have got to where

108
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,986
he couldn't take it anymore.

109
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,622
So one day, he just snapped.

110
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:47,292
Took out a pair of
garden shears and

111
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,996
cut his fingers clean
off, all of them.

112
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,534
I guess he just needed
to stop the pain.

113
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,273
Anyway, he's a lot happier now.

114
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,075
His brother takes care of him.

115
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,911
He gets monthly checks from
the government, no biggie.

116
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,582
I could never sell
his stuff anyway.

117
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:42,280
Mom?

118
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:45,116
Oh, hey, you must be hermann.

119
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,152
Did not wake you, did I?

120
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,993
There's a man in my bathroom.

121
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,661
Oh, that's Mr. Shariff.

122
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:00,465
He says he always tests a
shower before renting a place.

123
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,400
You're renting out my room?

124
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,002
Hermann, we need the money.

125
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,870
But where will I sleep?

126
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:10,408
With me, we'll be like roomies.

127
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,411
I love it, Zig, I'll take it.

128
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,254
Who is this?

129
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,523
Hey, uncle Felix, it's hermann.

130
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,025
Hermann who? I
don't know any...

131
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:05,363
oh, of course, Jackie's kid.

132
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,998
Well, ain't that a
kick in the pants.

133
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,966
How the hell are ya?

134
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,300
How's your mom?

135
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:13,471
Fine, uh, listen,
uncle Felix, I was...

136
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,874
hey, bun-bun, rum gimlet!

137
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:20,812
I, um, I was hoping I could
ask you for some advice.

138
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:26,117
Um, you know, on account of
you being a successful artist.

139
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,420
Um, oh, yeah, I get by.

140
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:33,291
Yeah, it's just
I'm an artist too.

141
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,960
And it's just not working out.

142
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,029
Hm, oh yeah?

143
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,964
Yeah, and I have the chops.

144
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,633
I mean, that's... that's not it.

145
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:45,670
It's just that something's
wrong, you know?

146
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:49,240
Like something's missing.

147
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,508
Stop right there.

148
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,777
I had the same problem
when I was starting out.

149
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,213
- You did?
- Absolutely!

150
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,783
Let me guess, you feel like
something's just not right.

151
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,719
Like there's this nebulous
dark cloud surrounding you.

152
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,754
Am I right, or am I right?

153
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,589
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,991
Are you all wound up tight?

155
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:11,162
Feelings of apathy,
depression, trouble sleeping?

156
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,997
Yeah.

157
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,500
Yup, I went through
the same thing.

158
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,769
I know exactly what you need.

159
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,405
You do? What?

160
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,308
Take down this address,
my old studio apartment.

161
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,344
Uh, okay, you
want me to go there?

162
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:29,147
Dammit, I want
you to live there.

163
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,816
What you need is your own
space to work, uninhibited.

164
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,184
And this place is perfect.

165
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,120
It's where I was holed
up at the precise moment

166
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,490
that success struck me
like a bolt from the blue.

167
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,059
Pow! Changed everything.

168
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,128
Yeah, I mean, that's
exactly what I need.

169
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:46,731
Aw, dammit, I said "gimlet."

170
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,134
Ice, rum, lime juice.

171
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,005
I tell ya, down here, these
are a beautiful people.

172
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,708
Yeah, um, thank you so much
for letting me stay there.

173
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,909
When can I move in?

174
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,311
Right away, 800 a month.

175
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:04,549
Oh, uh, I... I uh...

176
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,217
What, what's the matter?

177
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,954
I just... I can't afford that.

178
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,958
Come on, I'm renting
you well-being, freedom,

179
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,461
and at a very good rate for
a studio in that location.

180
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,695
You know what I think?

181
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:20,798
You can't afford to pass
it up is what I think.

182
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,134
I I just... I don't
have that kind of money.

183
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,103
Hermann, what can I tell ya?

184
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,005
Success doesn't come cheap.

185
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,339
You sleep on it.

186
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:31,175
Who knows, maybe you
can sell some blood?

187
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,861
I'm going to need
a lot of blood.

188
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,989
Artist Joel Windle has found

189
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,591
a new take on collaborative art.

190
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,294
He allows his buyers
to sign the artwork

191
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,096
and they even receive a portion

192
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:28,466
of the profits when
the next buyer signs.

193
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,004
I'm letting them
take part in the art.

194
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,273
I just made $20.

195
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,108
I just made two grand.

196
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,178
Okay, how is that
not a Ponzi scheme?

197
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,514
It's a small price for them
to pay to become an artist.

198
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,216
It's cheaper than
art school, anyway.

199
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,321
Devora.

200
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,626
- May I?
- Of course.

201
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,662
Ladies and gentlemen
of the art world,

202
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,198
I have a little announcement.

203
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,102
I am very excited to
announce that Joel Windle has

204
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,539
just signed on as the devora
klein gallery's newest artist.

205
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,875
Our group show is in a month.

206
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,010
He'll be my crowning Jewel.

207
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,981
Devora? Ms. klein?

208
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,317
Look, I am so sorry about
what happened back there.

209
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,152
That... that shouldn't
have happened, okay?

210
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,321
That wasn't part
of the art piece.

211
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,458
I, uh, I brought you some water.

212
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,131
Look, I... that isn't
1/10th of what I can do.

213
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,333
If you just give me a chance...

214
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,235
haven't you done
enough already?

215
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,904
You have to put me
in your next show.

216
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,606
- Please!
- Are we done here?

217
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,041
- A little more.
- I'll do anything, okay?

218
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,343
Just give me a chance,
just one chance.

219
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:56,547
I'll... I'll lock myself
up for two weeks.

220
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,316
And... and... and if I
don't produce something

221
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:03,187
startlingly, truly amazing,
then... then I'll...

222
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,455
Quit forever?

223
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,262
Yeah, yeah, I'll quit forever.

224
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,632
Fine, you do that.

225
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,870
Thank you so much, Ms. klein.

226
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,505
I... I won't let you down, okay?

227
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,383
Hey, uncle Felix,
hey, it's hermann.

228
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,085
Could you rent me the
place for two weeks?

229
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,586
It's all I've got.

230
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,087
H hi, I'm... I'm here
about the apartment.

231
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,656
You must be hermann.

232
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,492
I'm Layla, the manager.

233
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,028
Your uncle's told
me all about you.

234
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,763
You're the artist.

235
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,666
Yeah.

236
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,804
So...

237
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,974
I'll show you the apartment.

238
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,476
Uh...

239
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,817
You know, since I've
been manager here,

240
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:43,854
I don't think anybody's
ever lived in this unit.

241
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,956
Well, my... my uncle
lived in it, I guess,

242
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,393
until he bought the apartment.

243
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:58,402
Well, here, it's around
the corner and on the left.

244
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,172
Okay.

245
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,374
And garbage pickup's Fridays.

246
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,943
- Thanks.
- M-hm.

247
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,244
Hi, hermann, how's
your art coming?

248
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,581
Fine.

249
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,916
Aren't you going
to invite me in?

250
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,885
I'd love to see your work.

251
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:30,888
I don't like to show
works in progress.

252
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,859
Of course, I
understand completely.

253
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:37,695
Anyway, I was just baking, and I

254
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,797
accidentally made an extra pie

255
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,966
and I thought you
might be hungry.

256
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,270
You made a pie?

257
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:49,373
Peach. You do like
peach pie, don't you?

258
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,944
Yeah, uh...

259
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,117
Thanks.

260
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:06,257
Hermann, I just wanted
to tell you if you ever

261
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:09,693
need any help, not to presume
that I know anything about art

262
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,863
but if you ever need
any, I don't know,

263
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:17,935
moral support or something,
or anything, just let me know.

264
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,239
I should get back.

265
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:27,011
Don't worry, I'll
be back later for the plate.

266
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:20,117
Oh, okay, come on.

267
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,659
Ow.

268
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,833
I'm going insane.

269
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,033
Yes?

270
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:06,436
Hey, devora, it's, uh,
it's me, hermann haig.

271
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,972
Um, two weeks ago, I...
i said that I would

272
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,874
have something amazing for you.

273
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:14,311
And, well, it's...
it's been two weeks.

274
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,013
Right.

275
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,049
The one with the...
with the blood.

276
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,318
Yeah, yeah, right.

277
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,954
You know, this
really isn't the best time.

278
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:26,523
Thanks.

279
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,125
Uh...

280
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,631
Hello?

281
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,733
Hey, it's me.

282
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:39,302
Just if... if you'd
let me show you,

283
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,038
I think you're really
going to love it.

284
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,073
I mean, really, it's like...

285
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,841
It's like nothing
you've ever seen before.

286
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,676
I'm not taking on
any new artists right now.

287
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,578
Thanks.

288
00:30:50,948 --> 00:30:52,315
What?

289
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,451
Um, I don't understand.

290
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:57,854
Two weeks ago, you said,
"come back in two weeks."

291
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,657
Why would you... why would you
say that if... if like, uh...

292
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,592
when what,
when I didn't mean it?

293
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,094
Because I wanted you
to get out of my face,

294
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,529
and that's what I'm asking
you to do right now.

295
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,930
Walk away, do not come back.

296
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:09,066
Your art is terrible;
Please don't buzz me again.

297
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:18,875
Uh, I see, thanks.

298
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,991
Ladies and gentlemen,
hermann haig.

299
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:40,630
Here, maybe you can sell it.

300
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:43,400
Sure, chief.

301
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,172
Stupid, stupid, stupid Herman.

302
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:54,244
Yeah, two weeks, come on by.

303
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,017
What is it?

304
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,759
128, 129.50,

305
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:14,831
135, 2, 275, 280, 280.

306
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,833
300.

307
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,515
300? This is a
one-of-a-kind work of art.

308
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,506
- 400.
- - 2,000.

309
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:24,574
2,000.

310
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,911
2,000, going once, going...
Sold.

311
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,046
Aw, man.

312
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,891
It's really quite exquisite.

313
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:50,167
Back there, I owe
you an apology.

314
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,568
I'm sorry.

315
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:57,574
You know, it'd be a shame if the

316
00:32:57,576 --> 00:33:00,944
art world lost a
voice like yours.

317
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,156
Whoo! Yeah!

318
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:16,293
Yes!

319
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:20,030
Whoo!

320
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:25,101
Well, how did it go?

321
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,510
You're not dreaming.

322
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,179
I'm still here.

323
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,017
It was incredible.

324
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,185
You won't believe what happened.

325
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,288
Not only did the
piece sell, but guess

326
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,958
who wants to sign me
as her newest artist?

327
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,125
Did you get bigger?

328
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,760
Who wants to sign you?

329
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,596
Devora klein.

330
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:55,665
Devora klein!

331
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:59,069
That's great,
I knew you could do it.

332
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,873
It wasn't me, it
was what you gave me.

333
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,643
Thank you.

334
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,645
God, I still can't believe it.

335
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,547
I have more, you know.

336
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,653
You do?

337
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:22,325
Because, well, de... de... devora
wants to put me in a show.

338
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:25,128
And, well, if she
does that, then, uh,

339
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,664
I'm going to need
a lot more mobiles.

340
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:31,067
I have many, many more.

341
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,137
I get lonely here all by myself.

342
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,740
How about I help
you make mobiles,

343
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:41,044
and in return, all you have
to do is spend time with me?

344
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,482
That's it?

345
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:49,386
That's it. Partners?

346
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:54,658
Uh, yeah, yeah, partners.

347
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,261
If you had a hand, I'd shake it.

348
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,131
Why don't
we seal it with a kiss?

349
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:08,338
Think of all the incredible
art we could make together.

350
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,591
How was that?

351
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,328
Perfect.

352
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,474
All right, well

353
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,909
tell me some of
the bigger names.

354
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:49,179
Pollock, Warhol, Nagel.

355
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,847
Wait, you helped Nagel too?

356
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,982
Yeah, what can I say?

357
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,250
The Duran Duran guy?

358
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,386
Yes.

359
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,555
Who else?

360
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:00,657
It's not important.

361
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,666
Oh, hi.

362
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,968
I just came back
for my pie plate.

363
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,538
Oh, right, one sec, okay?

364
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,677
Here you go.

365
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,045
It was delicious.

366
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,547
- I'm so glad you liked it.
- - Yeah.

367
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,715
I'll make you another.

368
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,550
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, that's okay.

369
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,352
It's no problem.

370
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:36,259
Hermann, I don't
mean to pry, but

371
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,529
is there someone else
staying here with you?

372
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,464
Hm?

373
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:44,334
Well, it's just that
I could have sworn

374
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,737
I distinctly heard
a female voice.

375
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,073
Uh, I'm the only one here.

376
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,108
It's just me.

377
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,545
Good.

378
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,315
That is a lovely dress.

379
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:03,753
Wow.

380
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:12,729
- You're back.
- Hi, uh...

381
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,364
I've been thinking

382
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:16,232
about our next piece all day.

383
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,834
Shall we get started?

384
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:21,471
Uh, yeah, um, I
thought I told you.

385
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:24,374
I'm going to Devora's tonight.

386
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,645
Yeah, she's got these fancy
new art collectors in town,

387
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:32,215
and, well, she said it'd be a
good idea if I met them, so.

388
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,117
I see.

389
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,026
You should be happy.

390
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,928
She's showing our piece.

391
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,032
It's a good thing.

392
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:51,134
I hope they like it.

393
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:53,236
We can work when you get back.

394
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:58,908
Yeah, um, I don't know
when I'm going to be back,

395
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:03,980
so you probably
shouldn't wait up, uh...

396
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:09,919
See ya.

397
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,355
Bye.

398
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,593
Bye.

399
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:32,809
- Hermann.
- - Hi.

400
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,745
- Come on.
- Oh, okay.

401
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:41,317
Hermann, nice to meet you.

402
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,587
Hermann?

403
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,490
I have a present for you.

404
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,430
I guess I'll just
leave it outside.

405
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:04,440
Hermann?

406
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:09,679
I'm going to bring it inside
so... so nothing happens to it.

407
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,985
Okay, I'm coming in now.

408
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:21,591
Coming in...

409
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,235
A movie, right.

410
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:38,141
Will you excuse me?

411
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,811
Back off, Percy,
this one's mine.

412
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,618
You're excited?

413
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,320
I invited some of my
biggest collectors

414
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:51,921
to see your piece tonight.

415
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:54,624
Yeah, so don't blow it.

416
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:57,427
I just came by to
pick up my stuff.

417
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:00,396
I didn't know you
were having a party.

418
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,866
Your attention please?

419
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,435
Thanks.

420
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:43,640
This is a very
important moment for me

421
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:45,742
because the work
you're about to see

422
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:49,612
is from a man who
is proving to be

423
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:53,549
one of the most gifted
artists I've ever discovered.

424
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:59,555
It gives me great pleasure
to present to you...

425
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:05,662
Hermann Haig's "permission."

426
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:48,197
Hermann, I've never
seen anything like it.

427
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:51,601
They really like your piece.

428
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,971
What do you think of it?

429
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,773
What do I think?

430
00:42:56,775 --> 00:43:00,676
I think I just
sold it for 50,000.

431
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,345
To who?

432
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:04,447
Them.

433
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:17,860
You know, when I made
it, I was thinking of you.

434
00:43:19,062 --> 00:43:22,698
Well, whatever you're
doing, keep it up.

435
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,666
With something like
this, you've got

436
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:25,501
to strike while the iron's hot.

437
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:26,903
Well, you'll have to
do a one-man show.

438
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:29,272
- Really, me?
- Yeah.

439
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:31,407
How soon can you make four more?

440
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,345
- Uh, four?
- A month?

441
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,114
Uh...

442
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,583
I already sent out
the press releases.

443
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:44,287
Uh, yeah, I mean, I
think... I think I can.

444
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:49,358
Yeah? Because,
you know, you and I,

445
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:55,264
we could have a really
great future together.

446
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,602
They'll be ready in a month.

447
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:05,842
Good, we're going to make
a great team, you and I.

448
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:17,353
Tell me, hermann,
'cause I wanna know,

449
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:21,624
how does a guy like you get to

450
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:25,428
be so talented all of a sudden?

451
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,516
Aren't you going to
ask me how it went?

452
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,219
How did it go?

453
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:52,455
It was unreal.

454
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:57,326
All these fancy people there,
just... just to see my artwork.

455
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:04,400
And the way they reacted,
uh, you'll never guess.

456
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,335
Orgy?

457
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,639
How'd you know?

458
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:15,044
And she sold it.

459
00:45:16,546 --> 00:45:20,049
Oh, god, she is so amazing.

460
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,184
She wants me to
have my own show.

461
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,654
Me!

462
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,824
Can you believe it?

463
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,500
Are you crying?

464
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,703
I was afraid.

465
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:45,174
I started thinking you'd
leave me, never come back.

466
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:48,144
You're not serious?

467
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,379
You don't know what it's like.

468
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:55,384
Before you, I was all
alone, withering away.

469
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:57,687
It was unbearable.

470
00:45:58,221 --> 00:46:02,124
I won't go back
to that, not ever.

471
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:07,797
Look, I... I'm not leaving you.

472
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:12,601
Okay? I...

473
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:18,107
I could... I could
never leave you, okay?

474
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:10,760
Just a little more.

475
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,795
I'm trying.

476
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:15,031
Well, push harder.

477
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,257
I'm sorry.

478
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,228
What's wrong?

479
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,032
I don't know,
I just can't do this today.

480
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:53,235
But our deadline,
we're already behind.

481
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,304
I'm sorry, hermann.

482
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:58,908
Sometimes I just get blocked
up when I'm feeling lonely.

483
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:02,278
Even I need inspiration
once in a while.

484
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,180
But we're so close.

485
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:08,284
What if... is there
anything I can do?

486
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:12,154
Well, there is, actually.

487
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,624
At least, it would
put me more at ease.

488
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,159
What? Tell me.

489
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:20,863
I can't, not out loud.

490
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,420
You're joking, right?

491
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:51,894
No, that is... that is way too...

492
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,865
What?

493
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,868
I just... I just
think that we should

494
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:03,939
keep things between us
professional, all right?

495
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:13,349
Well then, I guess that's that.

496
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:16,519
So tell me, what's
devora going to say

497
00:49:16,521 --> 00:49:20,322
when you go to her empty handed?

498
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:35,838
Who am I kidding?

499
00:49:36,806 --> 00:49:39,575
I'm just the artist, right?

500
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:58,928
No, not like that.

501
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,032
Your shirt, take it off.

502
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:15,644
Now, kiss me.

503
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,949
Slow.

504
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:41,804
Touch me, slow.

505
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,427
Here you go.

506
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:22,564
How are the new pieces coming?

507
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:26,268
Fine.

508
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,569
"Art news nation" called.

509
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,338
They want to do an interview.

510
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:34,109
Okay.

511
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:41,083
Devora, have you ever gotten
involved with someone where

512
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:46,789
you're just a little bit unsure
that it's the right thing?

513
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,091
What do you mean?

514
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:54,196
Like you... you get mixed
up in a relationship, right?

515
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:59,268
And at first, it
seems so perfect.

516
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,071
But then...

517
00:54:04,073 --> 00:54:05,808
Percy's been talking
to you again, hasn't he?

518
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,743
- No, no, no, no.
- Trying to steal you from me?

519
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,045
That's not it, it's, uh...

520
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:11,513
You want more
money, is that it?

521
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:13,182
I mean, I can write
you another check.

522
00:54:13,184 --> 00:54:15,984
No, no, it... it's fine, okay?

523
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:19,922
Just... Just forget it.

524
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:27,162
Hermann, we've
come so far together.

525
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:34,870
You're a great artist,
and I sell great art.

526
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:38,407
Is that all we have?

527
00:54:44,647 --> 00:54:47,316
I want to show you something.

528
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:07,369
What do you think?

529
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:09,071
What do I think?

530
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:14,142
Uh, well, I think a
three-year-old painted these.

531
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,578
I mean, they're not even

532
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,114
horrendous in an
interesting way.

533
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:23,318
They're... They're
horrendous-bad.

534
00:55:24,787 --> 00:55:28,190
I mean, why would
you keep these?

535
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:30,459
Who's the artist?

536
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,131
Me.

537
00:55:38,434 --> 00:55:41,703
Oh, I'm... I'm so
sorry, I didn't know, I...

538
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:46,408
no, you're right,
they're awful.

539
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,012
I know.

540
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,183
You don't know what it's like.

541
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:59,054
But when it comes to
selling other people's art,

542
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:02,357
I'm the best there is.

543
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:06,895
You have real talent.

544
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:11,800
I'd kill for that.

545
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:20,142
But all the talent in the world
won't get your artwork seen.

546
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,080
That's something I do.

547
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:30,852
Understand?

548
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,723
You and I...

549
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:41,463
We're meant for each other.

550
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,343
Good morning, hermann.

551
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:33,715
I wanted to surprise you,
but I guess you found me.

552
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:37,719
Relax, it's still me.

553
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,790
It's you, you know.

554
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:45,260
Your love is making me grow.

555
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,964
How wonderful.

556
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:52,701
Uh, uh, we should get started.

557
00:57:52,703 --> 00:57:55,203
Are you sure
you wouldn't rather sleep in?

558
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:57,673
You got home pretty
late last night.

559
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,576
No, no, I'm... I'm fine.

560
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:03,278
Great.

561
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,148
I'll just get...
I'll just get changed.

562
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:09,284
Don't I
get a kiss good morning?

563
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,622
Well?

564
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:25,767
So, tell me, is
she better than me?

565
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,136
Is who?

566
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:29,304
You know who.

567
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:31,440
What are you
talking about, devora?

568
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,179
Uh, well, you know, we
had some... some things

569
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:40,215
to go over, some
details about the show.

570
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:42,150
I'll bet.

571
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:44,319
What does that mean?
Where is this coming from?

572
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:46,922
Do I need to draw you a map?

573
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:54,463
You know, I think I'm
just going to get some air.

574
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:57,065
Wait, don't go.

575
00:58:57,366 --> 00:58:59,401
I'm sorry.

576
00:58:59,902 --> 00:59:04,439
She doesn't care about
you, you know, not really.

577
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:07,075
I see what you're
doing, and it won't work.

578
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:09,578
She and I, we have
something, okay?

579
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,846
We have something special.

580
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:12,481
Hermann, what about us?

581
00:59:12,483 --> 00:59:14,416
What about us, huh?

582
00:59:14,418 --> 00:59:15,951
What about us?

583
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:19,154
What kind of relationship
could we possibly have?

584
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:22,090
You're not even fucking human.

585
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:28,797
I'm sorry.

586
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,098
I...

587
00:59:34,303 --> 00:59:36,071
I gotta go.

588
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,573
Hi, Herm.

589
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:13,175
This isn't hermann.

590
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:16,511
Who is this?

591
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:18,313
His partner.

592
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:20,415
We need to talk.

593
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:21,650
Hello?

594
01:00:25,454 --> 01:00:27,756
Come in.

595
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,127
The power's out.

596
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:42,370
Where are you?

597
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:46,241
Over here. Sit.

598
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:51,046
So, you're devora.

599
01:00:51,113 --> 01:00:53,181
Where are you exactly?

600
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:54,749
Behind the wall.

601
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:57,319
You'll have to
forgive me, I'm shy.

602
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:58,787
Who are you?

603
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:02,657
I'm the source
of Hermann's inspiration.

604
01:01:03,927 --> 01:01:06,862
You've seen his work
before he met me.

605
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:11,066
You must have noticed
the dramatic improvement.

606
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:15,837
Actually, I did
wonder about that.

607
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,939
I'll cut to the chase.

608
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:20,742
You make a killing
selling Hermann's art.

609
01:01:20,744 --> 01:01:24,179
But if it weren't for
me, there'd be no art.

610
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:27,015
I have a proposition for you.

611
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:30,952
I'll make sure you get one
masterpiece after another.

612
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:34,356
All you have to do is
stay away from him.

613
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:39,561
Well, I'd love to,
but hermann needs me.

614
01:01:39,563 --> 01:01:44,633
But in a way, I'm his muse.

615
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:49,137
Sorry, no deal.

616
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,574
You live here too?

617
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:53,808
Yes.

618
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:56,745
Ever think about moving?

619
01:01:56,747 --> 01:01:58,947
No.

620
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:05,153
Apparently,
neither do the rats.

621
01:02:22,104 --> 01:02:24,072
Feeling all right?

622
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:57,872
Devora? Devora!

623
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,742
Come on, devora!

624
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:04,045
Oh, hi.

625
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:07,716
Ow, uh, I must have dozed off.

626
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,186
Is your little girlfriend gone?

627
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,455
Girlfriend?

628
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:16,524
Hiding behind the wall.

629
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:22,630
I don't have a girlfriend.

630
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:49,858
Whoa.

631
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,460
I'm all right, really.

632
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:01,636
So that girl, she
doesn't make the art?

633
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,775
Never lays a finger on it.

634
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:08,577
Good.

635
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,417
- Hermann.
- Hey.

636
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:59,254
There's something you
need to know about me.

637
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:01,256
That woman in my apartment?

638
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:04,292
- She is your girlfriend.
- No, no.

639
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:06,628
Uh, she's not even a woman.

640
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,596
Look, I... I can't
explain it, okay?

641
01:06:08,598 --> 01:06:13,535
She... it... it was
something I found, okay?

642
01:06:13,537 --> 01:06:17,071
In the apartment, in the wall.

643
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:19,073
I know... I know it's
hard to believe.

644
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:24,145
But... but when you want
something so bad your whole life

645
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,682
and then... and then suddenly
it just gets handed to you,

646
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,652
you don't ask questions, okay?

647
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:32,854
You... you... you just take it!

648
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:37,358
Look, I don't make the
art, okay? I don't.

649
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,628
She does.

650
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,532
She does.

651
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,940
You think I'm crazy?

652
01:06:53,008 --> 01:06:57,545
Actually, I believe you.

653
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:04,185
You do?

654
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,888
I didn't want you
to find out that I...

655
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:09,257
that I don't have any
really talent, you know?

656
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:12,527
That... that I'm just some...

657
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,562
failed artist?

658
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:19,500
Yeah, yeah, but don't you see?

659
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:23,838
You and I, we belong together.

660
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:28,776
I mean, that is, if
you still want me.

661
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:35,183
Yes, yes, yes, of
course I want you.

662
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:43,958
There's something I
gotta do, okay, right now.

663
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:04,712
Come on, come on!

664
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:08,549
Joel?

665
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:11,452
Don't even think about it.

666
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:14,589
It's got to be
done, Joel, okay?

667
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,791
You have no idea what
you're getting involved in.

668
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:20,128
You had your chance.

669
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:23,364
Turn around and walk away.

670
01:08:41,483 --> 01:08:44,619
No, stop, don't hurt him!

671
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,788
You should be thanking me!

672
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:29,531
God.

673
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,955
Hermann, wait.

674
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:55,757
Hermann, what are you doing?

675
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:58,526
He was hurting you, I had to.

676
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,595
No, don't!

677
01:10:00,597 --> 01:10:02,797
Can't you see she just
wants you for your art?

678
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:05,299
Can't you see that,
what she really is?

679
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:07,735
Bitch! Monster!

680
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:12,273
Don't be such a fool, Hermann.

681
01:10:12,275 --> 01:10:14,375
She's using you..

682
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,544
We're in love.

683
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:23,985
Don't do this, I'm begging you.

684
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:27,188
Wait, remember
when we first met?

685
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:29,724
All you wanted was
to be an artist.

686
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:33,494
Remember, that was your dream.

687
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:19,207
What are you doing?

688
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:24,679
Transplanting her.

689
01:11:24,681 --> 01:11:28,015
I already have the perfect
spot picked out in my gallery.

690
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:32,086
From now on, I'm
making my own art.

691
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,492
No!

692
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:41,128
Stop it!

693
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:36,250
Hermann.

694
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,186
I'm here.

695
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:44,125
It's bad, real bad.

696
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:46,427
No, it... it's fine.

697
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:48,796
It'll be fine.

698
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:53,367
I'll patch you up,
you'll get better.

699
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:02,543
Forget the mobiles.

700
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:06,013
It's not about that.

701
01:13:09,217 --> 01:13:12,486
You mean so much
more to me than that.

702
01:13:12,854 --> 01:13:16,057
I don't know why I
never said it before.

703
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:25,533
I need you to know that, okay?

704
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:31,973
I need you to know that.
