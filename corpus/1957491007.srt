Now, here's where we are.

66
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:20,747
You've been
arrested for killing

67
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,849

of the United States.

There's never been
celebrations in the streets

71
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,458
for an assassination before,
but that's politics,

72
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:36,028
and this is law,
and from the law's perspective,

73
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:39,599
you will most likely
get the death penalty.

74
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,869
You'll be able
to play the system for years,

75
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:45,938
but unless we present an
alternative the jury will buy,

76
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:47,607
you'll be killed.

77
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:50,009

78
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:52,912
Okay.

79
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:58,484
Now, they have witnesses
and video footage that show

80
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:01,754
you with your rifle
pulling the trigger two times.

81
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,723
Did you do that?

82
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,025
Yes.

83
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:11,564
So we can try and convince

84
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:13,866
the jury
that the evidence is wrong,

85
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,402
that the witnesses
are either lying or confused,

86
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:20,973
that the footage has
been faked, or tampered with,

87
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:22,842
or that it's not really you,

88
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,744
to create reasonable
doubt that you did it.

89
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:27,647
If we create
reasonable doubt, you get off.

90
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:30,550
And I'm not
saying it's impossible,

91
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,052
but given
the circumstances so far,

92
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:35,488
it's a long, long shot.

93
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:41,527
You're obviously good at those,
but this is different.

94
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:45,965
Or we can take another approach

a plant in here with you.

I understand,
but let's assume

165
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:57,723
they don't find
any information on me.

166
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:01,093
Okay. It's pretty impossible.

167
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:03,996

amnesia is a strong defense.

of a larger defense.

00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:34,060
Next question.

179
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,062
How did you know
he was going to be landing

180
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:37,363
at Lincoln Airport for a rally?

181
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:38,764
It was predictable.

182
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,101
He landed there for his last
two rallies in Cincinnati.

183
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,870
But you rented an apartment
across from the airport

184
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:46,372
two months earlier?

185
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:48,274
I didn't know
when he was coming here,

186
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:50,643
but I knew he would eventually,
and that I'd be ready.

187
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:52,778
Like I said,
he was predictable.

188
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:56,715
Have you ever
been to a psychiatrist,

189
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:58,217
or any kind of therapy?

190
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,985
Nope,
I have no medical records.

191
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:02,054
Everyone has medical records.

192
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:04,790
I guess we'll see, won't we?

193
00:11:06,258 --> 00:11:07,393
Family?

194
00:11:07,427 --> 00:11:08,828
Nope.

195
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:11,130
Do you have a terminal illness?

196
00:11:11,397 --> 00:11:13,065
Not that I know of.

197
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,268
Do you think you're sane?

198
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:20,072
I'm a lot more sane
today than I was yesterday,

199
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,041
and so is the world.

200
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:24,210
So, that's your motivation?

201
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:27,246
Yes. Did you like him?

202
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,715
[chuckling softly]

203
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,719
Maybe you haven't noticed
I'm an African-American male.

204
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:36,689
He gave me zero
reasons to like him.

205
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:38,924
Didn't wanna
see him dead though.

206
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,894
Really? Never thought about it?

207
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:44,196
This isn't about me.

208
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,167
Actually it is, but I
understand it's not a sentiment

209
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,136
you want bouncing
around in your brain.

210
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:54,206
No, and just so you know,

211
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,109
like, like no one
deserves to be killed.

212
00:11:57,943 --> 00:11:59,879
If anyone did though...
[tongue clicking]

213
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,818
And
he was just getting warmed up,

214
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,821
Did you ever stop
to wonder how much damage

215
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,189
he can inflict on the world?

216
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,790
I have
to disagree with something

217
00:12:11,824 --> 00:12:13,692
you said when you sat down.

218
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:15,462
People have danced in the
streets to celebrate murdered

219
00:12:15,495 --> 00:12:19,331
leaders before, Mussolini,
Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi.

220
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:21,400
He's in good company.

221
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:23,035
He was elected president.

222
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:25,004
He wasn't a dictator.

223
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:29,041
But he wanted to be, and he
spoke glowingly of dictators.

224
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:30,943
He loved their power.

225
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:32,845
He wanted to be
like them, unchecked.

226
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,713
He said as much.

227
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:35,948
So you killed him?

228
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:37,950
Someone had to.

229
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:44,990
Tell you what?
I have what I need for today.

230
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:46,759
I'm going
to go down to the court house

231
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,060
and see
if there's any new information

232
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:49,995
we need to be made aware of.

233
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:54,467
Didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

234
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:55,868
You didn't.

235
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:59,271
How do you plan
on proving I'm insane?

236
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:02,308
I know someone, a coach.

237
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:03,443
A crazy coach?

238
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:06,278
Yes, and if there's
anyone who can make a case

239
00:13:06,312 --> 00:13:07,980
for an insanity defense,
it's her.

240
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:09,949
It sounds crazy enough.

241
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:13,052
Yeah, it is.
Let's hope so anyway.

242
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,054
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

243
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:17,189
In the meantime,
don't talk to anyone.

244
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:18,458
Got it.

245
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:21,927
[chair scraping]

246
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:24,096
Is there,
uh, anything you need?

247
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:25,465
Anyone I should call?

248
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:35,508
Could you bring me an orange?

249
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:38,244
You want an orange?

250
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:43,182
I might
be able to arrange that.

251
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:44,950
Thank you.

252
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,320
[Jason] You're welcome.
I'll see what I can do.

253
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:53,359
I'm glad we caught you. We need
to speak to your client.

254
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:56,161
[door buzzing]
[door clanging]

255
00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:57,497
About what?

256
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,198
You'll find out.

257
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:05,004
[door clanging and shutting]

258
00:14:05,037 --> 00:14:06,805
This is Art Bradley.

259
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,874
He's the head
prosecutor on your case,

260
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:10,577
and this is Agent Tucker.

261
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,911
He's with the FBI and is
in charge of the investigation.

262
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:16,449
We ran background
checks on Mr. Otis here.

263
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:19,818
It turns up, Amos Otis
served two tours in Iraq.

264
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:22,254
Since being discharged,
he's held various jobs.

265
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:24,056
The last one as a roofer.

266
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,535
You know this man?

267
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:40,406
No, I don't.

268
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,141
Ever seen him before?

269
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:44,109
I don't know him.

270
00:14:44,143 --> 00:14:46,045
That's enough. He answered you.

271
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:49,882
This is the Amos Otis
your truck is registered to.

272
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:51,451
He's black.

273
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:56,088
He's not some
lily white guy and he's dead.

274
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:58,257
Okay. I think we're done here.

275
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,392
- Did you kill him?
- I said we're done.

276
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:01,528
He was buried two weeks ago.

277
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:05,331
We're getting permission
to exhume the body as we speak.

278
00:15:06,098 --> 00:15:09,001
What's going on here?
What's your name?

279
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,203
I thought I was Amos Otis.

280
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:12,371
Didn't you?

281
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:13,939
That's not your fucking name.

282
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,008
[Jason] That's it.
I need to talk with my client.

283
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,276
You need to get out of here.

284
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:19,378
You need to figure
out who your client is.

285
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:21,246
No, that's your problem
and Agent Tucker's.

286
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,582
Now get the fuck out of here.

287
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:24,183
Right.

288
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,051
[door buzzing and clanging]

289
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:29,421
You talk
to your client, we'll be back.

290
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,660
[door clanging and slamming]

291
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:36,295
[footsteps receding]

292
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:37,530
Pretty crazy, huh?

293
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:45,605
[tense dramatic music playing]

294
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:48,608
Who are you?

295
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,444
If I told you,
you'd think I was crazy.

296
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:53,345
- Good.
- But I'm not.

297
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:55,414
What difference does it make?

298
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:57,049
It makes all
the difference in the world.

299
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,651
[Jason]
Whether you die or not?

300
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,252
Whether I'm believable.

301
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:03,188
That video
is pretty easy to believe.

302
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:08,127
I know.
Look, I need you to trust me.

303
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,362
Who are you?

304
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:13,433
You don't need to know,
and don't worry about them.

305
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:15,033
They'll chase
their tails trying to find out,

306
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,536
but they don't
need to know either.

307
00:16:17,002 --> 00:16:18,605
They had me on video, right?

308
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:21,073
Just move
forward with your defense.

309
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:23,242
Send in the crazy coach.

310
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:30,115
Okay.

311
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,252
For now,
she'll be here tomorrow.

312
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,660
What kind of crazy
do you think I should be?

313
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:44,997
[keys clanging]

314
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,466
You're the expert.

315
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:53,038
[door buzzing,
clanging and slamming]

316
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:33,212
[footsteps approaching]

317
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:39,719
[door buzzing and clanging]

318
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:42,254
Hi. I'm Charlotte Walker.

319
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:44,724
[door clanging and slamming]

320
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:46,358
Hello.

321
00:17:57,437 --> 00:17:58,771
Do you understand why I'm here?

322
00:18:01,073 --> 00:18:02,475
How good are you?

323
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:04,042
Excuse me?

324
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:05,712
Have you ever
gotten someone off

325
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:08,113
on an insanity defense before?

326
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:10,483
Let's get something straight.

327
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:15,087
My first role and only role is
to evaluate your mental state.

328
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,456
I'm not here to get you off.

329
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:18,758
That sounds nice.

330
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,126
But I want someone who can.

331
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:22,428
Have you ever done it before?

332
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,464
Yes.

333
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:27,032
There you go. How many times?

334
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,502
Twice.

335
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:33,205
Less than 1% of insanity
defenses are successful.

336
00:18:34,507 --> 00:18:35,675
So, what are my chances?

337
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:37,710
I don't know yet.

338
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:39,278
What's it going to take?

339
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,851
First, you need to understand
that an insanity defense

340
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:48,186
is not a determination
of mental illness.

341
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,622
It's a legal term.

342
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:53,392
Determining mental illness
is a psychological process.

343
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:56,663
The courts and juries
aren't capable of doing that.

344
00:18:56,696 --> 00:18:59,264
So, the courts established
a set of guidelines that need

345
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:03,135
to be met in order to consider
someone legally insane.

346
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:05,672
There are only
three guidelines, okay?

347
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:10,375
The first one is this;
did the defendant understand

348
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:12,645
that what he was
doing was illegal?

349
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:15,748
Did you know the difference
between right and wrong?

350
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:19,819
That's a question.

351
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:22,555
Did you know that what
you were doing was wrong?

352
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:24,824
No. It made perfect sense.

353
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:26,191
I didn't do anything wrong.

354
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,093
Nothing?

355
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:34,567
Okay. Moving on.
Guideline number two.

356
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:37,670
Did the defendant not
know what he was doing?

357
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:40,607
Were you mentally
incapacitated in some way?

358
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,810
I wasn't the one
who was mentally incapacitated.

359

This isn't funny.

360

The third one.

362
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:54,654
Was the defendant
compelled to commit the crime

363
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:56,856
by an irresistible force?

364
00:19:57,356 --> 00:19:58,725
Do you hear voices?

365
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:01,393
Screams.

Screams
of the innocent, don't you?

368
00:20:09,802 --> 00:20:14,607
Okay. There's one
more thing to keep in mind.

369
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:18,845
Mental illness isn't
an excuse in and of itself.

370
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:23,549
If someone has intent, if
they intended to do something,

371
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,519
then insanity can't
be used as a defense.

372
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:28,320

375
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:36,629
I could never kill him.

376
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:39,197
He's been dead
over a 100 years.

377
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,402
Then, how could I kill him?

378
00:20:45,605 --> 00:20:46,739
How am I doing?

How do you plead?

Your Honor, I object that my
defendant's identity has not

432
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:45,745
been established,
and therefore, it is impossible

433

The Court has assigned the name
'John Doe' to your client.

I can't imagine that when
you signed up for jury duty,

you thought you'd wind up on
a jury for a trial like this,

452
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:32,591

been conducted in the history

We have sadly experienced the

unlike this defendant,

456
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:47,173
those assassins never
made it into a courtroom.

need to feel overwhelmed.

In fact, it's my job to make
your job as easy as possible.

459
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:57,283
I promise to do
that because there has never

We are going
to demonstrate

462
00:26:03,556 --> 00:26:06,625
beyond any reasonable doubt
that the man seated before you,

463
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:09,895
charged here as John Doe,

464
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:12,798
knowingly
and with willful intent

465
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:16,102
killed the President
of the United States.

466
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:19,205
Now, he may claim that
he does not know who he is.

467
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:22,608
We will prove that he does

468
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:25,978
and that his actions served
to not only hide his identity,

469
00:26:26,012 --> 00:26:28,814
but that he planned
his crime

470
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:30,683
in advance.

471
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:33,819
We will demonstrate that
he purchased the sniper rifle

472
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:35,654
used in the attack,

473
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:38,624
specifically for the purpose
of killing the President,

474
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:41,794
that he traveled over 300 miles
to commit this crime,

475
00:26:43,162 --> 00:26:44,630
that he rented the apartment

476
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:46,265
from where the attack
took place,

477
00:26:46,298 --> 00:26:49,835
specifically for the purpose
of committing this crime,

478
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:52,138
and then he waited patiently

479
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:54,740
for the opportunity
to stage his attack.

480
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:58,811
We will prove that
the defendant

481
00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:01,247
is not only mentally competent

482
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,883

- Two months.

501

rent him the apartment?

in that experience?

504

505
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:14,253
What was that?

506
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:16,856
Uh, he paid for the first
six months rent in cash.

507
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:19,191
- In cash?
- Yes.

508
00:28:19,225 --> 00:28:22,261
Did he offer any explanation
as to why he wanted to do that?

509
00:28:22,294 --> 00:28:26,332
He told me he was a pilot,
that he flew corporate jets.

510
00:28:26,365 --> 00:28:29,735
He explained that he owned
a condominium downtown,

511
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:32,037
he was married,

512
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:34,173
and he was seeing
another woman on the side

513
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:35,374
and needed a place
to meet her.

514
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:37,409

I've been in this business
for a long time,

517
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:44,451
and I think I've heard it all.

518
00:28:44,484 --> 00:28:46,685
Uh, when
someone pays cash,

519
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,254
it's gonna raise an eyebrow

520
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:50,389
and believe me, I've had
my eyebrows raised before,

521
00:28:50,422 --> 00:28:52,992
but usually,
the reason they give,

522
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:54,426
you know it's a lie

523
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:55,961
the minute
it comes out of their mouth,

524
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:58,797
but it's not my job to judge.

525
00:28:58,831 --> 00:29:01,700
It's my job to rent
and maintain apartments.

526

00:29:17,183 --> 00:29:18,984
Oh, yeah.

534
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:21,220
And did you ever see him
in the company of a woman?

535
00:29:21,253 --> 00:29:22,955
Do you know
if his story was true?

536
00:29:22,988 --> 00:29:25,090
Nope and nope.

537
00:29:25,124 --> 00:29:27,126
Uh, I don't live
at the building,

538
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:28,428
uh, so I don't see
the residents

539
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:29,828
unless there's an issue.

540
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:31,830
And did he have any issues?

541
00:29:32,965 --> 00:29:35,234
Well, just this one.

542
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,871
How much did he pay
for half a year's rent?

543
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:40,339
Six thousand dollars.

544
00:29:40,372 --> 00:29:42,808
- In cash?
- Yes.

545
00:29:42,841 --> 00:29:44,376
Where do you think
he got that money?

546
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,514
Well, I've had my share
of corporate pilots

547
00:29:47,547 --> 00:29:49,915
in the building
and they do pretty well.

548
00:29:49,949 --> 00:29:52,885
So I didn't think it was drug
money or anything like that.

549
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:56,523
What can you tell us about
the apartment he selected?

550
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:59,391
Uh, he was interested in
the top floor of the building.

551
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:01,260
- Did he say why?
- No.

552
00:30:01,293 --> 00:30:03,329
Uh, most people prefer
the top floor.

553
00:30:03,362 --> 00:30:05,064
Why is that?

554
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:07,066
Footsteps.
Don't want to hear them.

555
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:09,068
Anything else about him?

556
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,538
Uh, not that
I can think of.

557
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:13,405
I thought he was a nice guy.

558
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:16,443
You still think that?

559
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,145
One last question.

560
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:22,248
The top floor,
it has a balcony, yes?

561
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:24,451
- Yes.
- The view from the balcony,

562
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:26,952
can you see the airport
from there?

563
00:30:26,986 --> 00:30:30,490
Yes, it's a mile away
but yes.

564
00:30:30,523 --> 00:30:32,459
Can you see the tarmac
in front of the control tower?

565
00:30:32,492 --> 00:30:36,795
Probably need binoculars
but yes.

566
00:30:37,464 --> 00:30:39,466
Thank you, Mr. Rosenberg.
That's all.

567
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:42,001
Mr. Johnson.

568
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:44,036
Reserve the right to cross,
Your Honor.

569
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:45,505
Very well.

570
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:47,106
Thank you, Mr. Rosenberg.
You may go.

571
00:30:48,475 --> 00:30:51,243
Your Honor, I'd like
to call Mr. Frank Jenkins.

572
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,088
[disgusted utterance]

573
00:31:04,056 --> 00:31:05,391
[deep sigh]

574
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:07,826
[Judge] Mr. Jenkins.

575
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,306
Please raise your right hand.

576
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:24,176
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

577
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:25,911
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

578
00:31:25,944 --> 00:31:27,980
I do.

579
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:34,953
Hello, Mr. Jenkins.

580
00:31:34,987 --> 00:31:37,156
Would you mind telling
the court

581
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:40,159
if you recognize this weapon?

582
00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:45,565
Oh, I'm sorry.

583
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:49,602
It's a little too dark
in here, don't you think?

584
00:31:49,636 --> 00:31:50,969
Excuse me?

585
00:31:51,003 --> 00:31:52,472
You heard me.

586
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,342
Do you recognize
this weapon, Mr. Jenkins?

587
00:31:57,109 --> 00:31:58,944
Yes, I used to own it.

588
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:01,146
How do you know
that this was your rifle?

589
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,083
The, the brown streaks
and the camouflage paint,

590
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:05,384
I added those.

591
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:06,519
These?

592
00:32:06,553 --> 00:32:08,053
Yes.

593
00:32:08,087 --> 00:32:10,189
This is your work.
You're positive?

594
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:11,558
Yes, they don't come
with the brown streaks.

595
00:32:11,591 --> 00:32:14,527
I call it custom camo.

596
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:17,162
Does anybody else
do custom camo?

597
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:21,066
On a CheyTac M200?

598
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,001
[chuckling]
Not hardly.

599
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:24,471
Not hardly?

600
00:32:24,504 --> 00:32:27,574
Just me, nobody else.
It's my gun.

601
00:32:27,607 --> 00:32:29,241
Thank you.

602
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:31,076
What happened to it?

603
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,412
I sold it at a gun show.

604
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:35,914
Do you remember
who you sold it to?

605
00:32:35,948 --> 00:32:37,450
I sure do.

606
00:32:37,484 --> 00:32:39,586
Is that person
sitting in this room?

607
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:42,421
Yeah, right there,
the socialist prick.

608
00:32:42,455 --> 00:32:44,957
- Objection.
- I hope you fry his ass

609
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,527
and feed his drizzled carcass
to the fucking dogs!

610
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,661
[gavel slamming]

611
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:50,129
- Fuck you.
- Order.

612
00:32:52,532 --> 00:32:54,634
Please instruct
your witness that outburst

613
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:56,669
is a grounds
for contempt of court.

614
00:32:56,703 --> 00:32:58,471
Sorry, Your Honor.

615
00:32:58,505 --> 00:32:59,938
Please proceed.

616
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:02,007
Thank you, Your Honor.

617
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:05,377
What can you tell us
about this weapon?

618
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:08,213
It's a finely-tuned

619
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:10,182
high-performance
killing machine.

620
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:11,984
Why do you say that?

621
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:15,254
Well, it's the preferred
weapon of Navy SEAL snipers.

622
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:18,090
It has an effective range
of 1.4 miles,

623
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:21,226
which is farther than
any other rifle in the world.

624
00:33:21,728 --> 00:33:24,163
It holds the world record
for accuracy.

625
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:29,234
It can split a walnut
from over a mile away.

626
00:33:29,268 --> 00:33:31,270
This was your weapon?

627
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:32,639
Yes.

628
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:35,240
Are you a dealer?

629
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:37,242
[chuckling] No.

630
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:39,746
How did you sell this at a gun
show if you're not a dealer?

631
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:42,582
There's a flea market
right next to the show.

632
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:45,250
You register,
give them 100 bucks,

633
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:48,053
and you can sell
all your personal weapons.

634
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,356
Is that where
you met the defendant?

635
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,593
- Yes.
- Tell me.

636
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:55,961
Did he seem like
he knew what he was doing?

637
00:33:56,763 --> 00:34:00,467
Yes, he told me
he was a Navy SEAL.

638
00:34:02,502 --> 00:34:04,169
Why did you sell it?

639
00:34:05,404 --> 00:34:07,005
I needed the money.

640
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:10,042
I've got lung cancer.

641
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:13,145
No insurance.

642
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:16,114
I don't need a rifle anymore.

643
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,652
How much
did you get for it?

644
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,588
Six grand.

645
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:24,089
In cash?

646
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:27,326
Yeah, in a, uh,
uh, manila envelope,

647
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,262
like something
out of the movies.

648
00:34:33,232 --> 00:34:34,734
Thank you, Mr. Jenkins.

649
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:36,401
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

650
00:34:37,537 --> 00:34:38,705
Mr. Johnson.

651
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:40,673
Right to redirect,
Your Honor.

652
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,742
Nothing now?

653
00:34:42,775 --> 00:34:44,343
No, Your Honor.

654
00:34:52,685 --> 00:34:56,121
Ms. Woodburn, would you state
your occupation for the jury?

655
00:34:56,154 --> 00:34:59,526
Yes. I'm in charge of security
for the Corwin Institute.

656
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:02,294
And where's
the Corwin Institute located?

657
00:35:02,327 --> 00:35:04,229
5921 Airport Drive.

658
00:35:04,263 --> 00:35:06,599
Is that next door
to Alpine Terrace Apartments?

659
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:08,267
Yes.

660
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,703
Does the Corwin Institute
use video cameras

661
00:35:10,737 --> 00:35:12,337
as part
of its security system?

662
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:13,640
- Yes.
- How many?

663
00:35:13,673 --> 00:35:15,374
- 24.
- And, by chance,

664
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:16,843
would one of those cameras
have been directed

665
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:19,244
at Alpine Terrace Apartments?

666
00:35:19,278 --> 00:35:21,146
- Yes.
- Why is that?

667
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:22,649
It wasn't supposed to be.

668
00:35:22,682 --> 00:35:24,249
What do you mean?

669
00:35:24,283 --> 00:35:25,852
It's mounted on our roof

670
00:35:25,885 --> 00:35:28,353
and we had a huge storm
the day before,

671
00:35:28,387 --> 00:35:29,756
and it must have broken off

672
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:31,624
one of the clips
that held it.

673
00:35:31,658 --> 00:35:33,860
It wound up pointing
at Alpine Terrace.

674
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:35,461
Are they monitored
in real time?

675
00:35:35,495 --> 00:35:36,829
Yes, they are.

676
00:35:36,863 --> 00:35:38,531
Were they being monitored

677
00:35:38,565 --> 00:35:39,732
on the day of the
President's assassination?

678
00:35:39,766 --> 00:35:41,400
Yes and no.

679
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:43,503
They're not monitored
full-time.

680
00:35:43,536 --> 00:35:46,405
Our video officer
makes rounds, eats,

681
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:48,407
goes to the bathroom,
stuff like that,

682
00:35:48,441 --> 00:35:52,277
and isn't stationed at the
monitor desk 24 hours a day.

683
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:55,147
Um, no one
was watching the monitor

684
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,883
at the time of the shooting,

685
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:59,452
so I ordered
a full review of the tapes.

686
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:00,787
What did you discover?

687
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,323
Footage of that man
over there,

688
00:36:04,356 --> 00:36:06,626
setting up and shooting a rifle

689
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:08,561
on the balcony
of Alpine Terrace,

690
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:11,764
recorded precisely at
the time of the assassination.

691
00:36:11,798 --> 00:36:14,232
How do you know it
was the precise time?

692
00:36:14,266 --> 00:36:16,903
There is a time code
on the video.

693
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:19,404
Would you be able to verify the
tape if I played it for you?

694
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:21,206
Yes, absolutely.

695
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:23,308
Your Honor, request permission
to show the jury

696
00:36:23,342 --> 00:36:24,611
the footage on the tape?

697
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:26,144
Very well.

698
00:36:26,178 --> 00:36:28,180
Will the Bailiff
please prepare the room?

699
00:36:45,765 --> 00:36:48,835
12:14:58,
remember that number.

700
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:50,603
We're going to show
you news footage

701
00:36:50,637 --> 00:36:52,270
of what the defendant
was aiming at

702
00:36:52,304 --> 00:36:54,607
at precisely this moment,
but first...

703
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:00,713
the first shot went through

704
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:03,248
Secret Service Agent,
William Winslow's thigh,

705
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:05,885
and you will see
Agent Winslow grab his thigh

706
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:08,186
and collapse forward
towards the shooter,

707
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,456
leaving a clear shot
on the President,

708
00:37:13,493 --> 00:37:15,862
which blew
the President's head off.

709
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:21,734
Please, instruct your client

00:45:05,264 --> 00:45:08,267
You are
on a short, short leash.

887
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,769
Don't make me jerk it.

888
00:45:10,803 --> 00:45:12,705
I understand.

889
00:45:12,738 --> 00:45:13,739
Proceed.

890
00:45:15,975 --> 00:45:18,944
You have to admit that
sounds pretty far-fetched.

891
00:45:18,978 --> 00:45:20,679
Yes, but it's the truth.

892
00:45:22,348 --> 00:45:24,216
How did you get here?

893
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,752
My body was squared
and sent back in time.

894
00:45:26,785 --> 00:45:28,387
What do you mean squared?

895
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,789
Sorry, it's a term
we use to describe

896
00:45:30,823 --> 00:45:32,391
how our molecules
are deconstructed

897
00:45:32,424 --> 00:45:35,694
and sent through time faster
than the speed of light.

898
00:45:35,728 --> 00:45:37,730
It's a reference to Einstein's
theory of relativity,

899
00:45:37,763 --> 00:45:40,099
E=mc2.

900
00:45:40,132 --> 00:45:42,001
Einstein maintained that

901
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:43,969
if you could surpass
the speed of light,

902
00:45:44,003 --> 00:45:47,006
you could travel back in time.
He was correct.

903
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:51,310
If that's true,
why are you sitting here?

904
00:45:51,343 --> 00:45:53,145
Why not go back to the future?

905
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:55,147
A couple of reasons.

906
00:45:55,181 --> 00:45:59,251
First, the machine that sent
me here doesn't exist here.

907
00:45:59,285 --> 00:46:02,221
It won't be invented
for another 30 years.

908
00:46:02,254 --> 00:46:04,123
What's another one?

909
00:46:04,156 --> 00:46:06,025
The world I came from
won't be the same.

910
00:46:06,058 --> 00:46:07,993
I may not have even been born.

911
00:46:08,027 --> 00:46:10,062
How's that?

912
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:11,797
The death
of your president

913
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,833
changes the course
of history, hopefully.

914
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:18,938
So you're suggesting that
in the world you come from

915
00:46:18,971 --> 00:46:22,374
our future, this president
had not been assassinated?

916
00:46:22,408 --> 00:46:23,976
Yes.

917
00:46:24,009 --> 00:46:26,178
And what you've done
could change the future?

918
00:46:26,212 --> 00:46:28,481
Yes.

919
00:46:28,515 --> 00:46:30,216
Is that why you're here?

920
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:32,184
Objection.
This is a mockery.

921
00:46:32,218 --> 00:46:33,819
Overruled.

922
00:46:33,852 --> 00:46:35,321
Save it for your cross,
Mr. Bradley.

923
00:46:37,022 --> 00:46:38,324
Is that why you're here?

924
00:46:39,325 --> 00:46:42,795
Yes, we determined
an intervention was called for.

925
00:46:42,828 --> 00:46:45,397
- Why?
- My world.

926
00:46:46,999 --> 00:46:49,235
Your world,
40 years from now,

927
00:46:50,336 --> 00:46:51,403
is on fire.

928
00:46:52,371 --> 00:46:54,807
It's on
the brink of destruction.

929
00:46:55,508 --> 00:46:57,843
Thirty percent
of the Earth's landmass

930
00:46:57,876 --> 00:47:00,513
that exists today
has been destroyed by fire,

931
00:47:00,547 --> 00:47:03,782
oceans have swallowed up
60% of the continents.

932
00:47:03,816 --> 00:47:06,151
Entire cities and countries
had been eliminated

933
00:47:06,185 --> 00:47:08,053
by typhoons and hurricanes.

934
00:47:08,087 --> 00:47:09,321
Japan is gone.

935
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:11,323
Central America is gone.

936
00:47:11,357 --> 00:47:12,992
Mexico is gone.

937
00:47:13,025 --> 00:47:14,860
All that's left
of South America

938
00:47:14,893 --> 00:47:16,362
is the central part of Brazil.

939
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:19,198
Florida and
the Eastern Seaboard are gone.

940
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,370
The Earth's population
is down to one billion people.

941
00:47:24,403 --> 00:47:26,473
Famine is rampant.

942
00:47:26,506 --> 00:47:28,307
There is no rule of law.

943
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,342
Gangs and tribes
control territories

944
00:47:30,376 --> 00:47:32,344
instead of governments.

945
00:47:32,378 --> 00:47:35,014
People are shot in the street
on a regular basis.

946
00:47:35,047 --> 00:47:37,049
There is no order, only chaos.

947
00:47:37,082 --> 00:47:39,818
Your Honor, this is crazy.

948
00:47:39,852 --> 00:47:41,454
Your Honor
I believe Mr. Bradley

949
00:47:41,488 --> 00:47:44,123
had my client examined
for any mental health issues

950
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:46,158
and provided expert testimony
to the court

951
00:47:46,191 --> 00:47:48,861
stating that my client
is not mentally ill.

952
00:47:48,894 --> 00:47:51,196
I suggest he refrain
from slandering my client

953
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:53,399
and attempting
to prejudice the jury

954
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:55,535
unless he's prepared
to accept our insanity plea.

955
00:47:57,303 --> 00:47:58,937
Mr. Bradley?

956
00:47:58,971 --> 00:48:01,474
He's not insane,
this is insane.

957
00:48:01,508 --> 00:48:04,877
No, this is my courtroom
and I suggest you respect it.

958
00:48:06,111 --> 00:48:07,212
I'm sorry.

959
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:10,082
- Proceed.
- Thank you.

960
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:15,888
Let's talk about the testimony
we heard earlier, okay?

961
00:48:15,921 --> 00:48:17,089
Yes.

962
00:48:17,122 --> 00:48:19,291
Your landlord, Mr. Rosenberg,

963
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:21,594
stated that
you rented his apartment

964
00:48:21,628 --> 00:48:24,163
two months in advance
of the rally, correct?

965
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:26,065
Yes.

966
00:48:26,098 --> 00:48:27,600
And the rally wasn't announced
until the day before?

967
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:30,202
- Yes.
- How did you know

968
00:48:30,235 --> 00:48:32,271
there was going to be
one here on that day?

969
00:48:32,304 --> 00:48:36,075
You call this
the information age, correct?

970
00:48:37,009 --> 00:48:40,312
Imagine how much information
is available 40 years from now.

971
00:48:40,346 --> 00:48:41,581
We looked it up.

972
00:48:43,516 --> 00:48:45,417
Both Mr. Rosenberg
and Mr. Jenkins

973
00:48:45,452 --> 00:48:47,886
indicated that
you had large sums of cash.

974
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,021
Did you bring
the cash with you?

975
00:48:49,054 --> 00:48:50,623
Cash?

976
00:48:50,657 --> 00:48:53,493
Your cash is going to
be confiscated in 10 years.

977
00:48:53,526 --> 00:48:55,894
So, no,
no cash where I'm from.

978
00:48:55,928 --> 00:48:57,896
I picked up the cash when
I arrived here.

979
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,532
From where?

980
00:48:59,566 --> 00:49:01,166
Amos Otis.

981
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,202
The person
whose truck you drove here?

982
00:49:03,235 --> 00:49:04,637
Yes.

983
00:49:04,671 --> 00:49:06,573
He was found dead.

984
00:49:06,606 --> 00:49:08,608
Heart attack
on his couch.

985
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:11,544
If they haven't found that
out yet, they will.

986
00:49:11,578 --> 00:49:13,546
The cash?

987
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,682
It was sitting on his coffee
table next to a box of opioids.

988
00:49:15,715 --> 00:49:17,282
He lived alone.

989
00:49:17,316 --> 00:49:19,184
I stopped by
the night he died.

990
00:49:19,218 --> 00:49:21,454
So you knew
when he was going to die

991
00:49:21,488 --> 00:49:23,055
and that he had all that cash?

992
00:49:23,456 --> 00:49:25,257
It was in the newspaper.

993
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,594
I took the cash and the truck
before he was found,

994
00:49:27,627 --> 00:49:29,061
no one missed it.

995
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:31,029
Okay.

996
00:49:31,063 --> 00:49:34,933
So you buy the rifle,
drive here,

997
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:37,403
rent the apartment,
wait for the rally.

998
00:49:38,237 --> 00:49:40,339
Why not just come here
right before the President

999
00:49:40,372 --> 00:49:42,408
was arriving
if that was your plan?

1000
00:49:42,442 --> 00:49:44,276
We needed all the other pieces.

1001
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:47,012
We ran analytics,
probability tests

1002
00:49:47,045 --> 00:49:50,115
to map out
the best-case scenarios.

1003
00:49:50,149 --> 00:49:53,520
We needed cash to navigate,
a weapon for the mission,

1004
00:49:53,553 --> 00:49:55,354
a point of attack,
and a place of attack,

1005
00:49:55,387 --> 00:49:57,624
and the shortest lead time

1006
00:49:57,657 --> 00:49:59,526
to minimize
the threat of discovery.

1007
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:01,360
That led us here,

1008
00:50:01,393 --> 00:50:03,530
where the cash, rifle,
apartment, and rally

1009
00:50:03,563 --> 00:50:05,230
were all in the same region

1010
00:50:05,264 --> 00:50:06,599
and available
within a two-month window.

1011
00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:08,967
Did you look at other options?

1012
00:50:09,001 --> 00:50:10,503
Of course, runner-up

1013
00:50:10,537 --> 00:50:12,472
was a rally in Kansas City
in a month,

1014
00:50:12,505 --> 00:50:15,340
but it had a longer window,
so it was riskier.

1015
00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:20,480
You make it sound,
well, pretty clinical.

1016
00:50:20,713 --> 00:50:22,981
Our world was at risk.

1017
00:50:23,015 --> 00:50:25,250
We had the ability
to try to save it.

1018
00:50:25,284 --> 00:50:27,052
We needed
to take our best shot.

1019
00:50:27,085 --> 00:50:29,456
We can't control what
happens here in this room,

1020
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:32,592
but what happens here
will change history too.

1021
00:50:34,494 --> 00:50:37,963
It's an overwhelming
responsibility.

1022
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,702
You've placed
a lot of responsibility

1023
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:44,403
for the future
on the President.

1024
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:46,371
Can you be more specific?

1025
00:50:46,405 --> 00:50:49,007
What was he doing that was
so bad we couldn't overcome it?

1026
00:50:51,511 --> 00:50:55,380
Your country is racing
towards civil war

1027
00:50:55,414 --> 00:50:58,016
and he was leading the charge.

1028
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,553
Divide and conquer
had been his mantra

1029
00:51:00,587 --> 00:51:03,255
since he announced
he was running for president.

1030
00:51:03,288 --> 00:51:05,458
He used the tools
of propaganda to influence

1031
00:51:05,492 --> 00:51:08,026
enough people
to keep him in office.

1032
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,163
He exploited their fears,
he incited their anger,

1033
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:15,334
and their anger
is a powerful weapon.

1034
00:51:16,736 --> 00:51:18,671
I know a lot
of you voted for him.

1035
00:51:18,705 --> 00:51:20,673
I know a lot
of you want me dead.

1036
00:51:20,707 --> 00:51:23,510
I know how strange
this must sound to you.

1037
00:51:24,343 --> 00:51:26,513
Think about
what he's done so far.

1038
00:51:26,546 --> 00:51:28,748
Neighbors
won't talk to neighbors.

1039
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:31,350
The world order
that had kept order

1040
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:33,720
since World War II
has been destroyed.

1041
00:51:33,753 --> 00:51:38,190
Your trusted allies who have
stood by you for decades

1042
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,192
had been cast aside.

1043
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:42,529
Tyrants
are supporting tyrants

1044
00:51:42,562 --> 00:51:45,397
to squash dissent
wherever it arises.

1045
00:51:45,431 --> 00:51:47,266
Your president supported them.

1046
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,770
Your freedom of speech
is under assault.

1047
00:51:50,803 --> 00:51:54,206
Criticism of his regime
is not tolerated

1048
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,643
and the source
of any criticism or objection

1049
00:51:56,676 --> 00:51:59,646
is targeted for retribution.

1050
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,284
He has used every tool at his
disposal to silence dissent,

1051
00:52:05,317 --> 00:52:08,420
whether those tools were
legal or not, did not matter.

1052
00:52:08,454 --> 00:52:10,590
He had no respect
for the rule of law

1053
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,191
unless he could use it
to protect his regime.

1054
00:52:17,195 --> 00:52:22,200
You're divided
by race and religion

1055
00:52:22,234 --> 00:52:24,771
and class like never before.

1056
00:52:24,804 --> 00:52:27,807
He inspired racists
to come out of the shadows

1057
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,542
and spew their hatred.

1058
00:52:30,142 --> 00:52:31,811
And you haven't
seen anything yet.

1059
00:52:31,844 --> 00:52:34,379
He would have rigged
and stolen the next election

1060
00:52:34,413 --> 00:52:37,717
and been emboldened
with more power than ever,

1061
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:41,588
fascism would be an improvement
over what was in store for you.

1062
00:52:41,621 --> 00:52:43,489
Hitler was a lightweight
compared to the president

1063
00:52:43,523 --> 00:52:46,158
you watched lie
every day and applaud.

1064
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:48,494
Objection. He cannot compare
the President to Hitler.

1065
00:52:48,528 --> 00:52:50,697
You are right, no comparison,
and it would be too late

1066
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:51,864
before you
figure it out.

1067
00:52:54,834 --> 00:52:58,337
Mr. Bradley, just because you
don't like what you hear,

1068
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,640
does not give you the right
to object to his testimony.

1069
00:53:01,774 --> 00:53:03,509
There's one thing
I can assure you,

1070
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,678
and that is when history
looks back on this trial,

1071
00:53:05,712 --> 00:53:07,847
this man will have
received a fair one.

1072
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,682
Do you understand?

1073
00:53:09,716 --> 00:53:12,852
If you have an objection,
please state your grounds.

1074
00:53:12,885 --> 00:53:15,688
This is a complete
and total fabrication,

1075
00:53:15,722 --> 00:53:17,490
he is making a mockery
of this court room.

1076
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:18,625
I'll be the judge of that.

1077
00:53:18,658 --> 00:53:20,325
If you don't agree,

1078
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:22,227
I can always bring in
another prosecutor.

1079
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,296
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

1080
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:25,765
That won't be necessary.

1081
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:28,701
Okay then, we'll proceed.

1082
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:31,403
And I'll remind the
people in this court room

1083
00:53:31,437 --> 00:53:33,506
that outbursts
will not be tolerated.

1084
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,208
I have no problem throwing
people out of here.

1085
00:53:37,477 --> 00:53:39,244
Thank you.

1086
00:53:39,277 --> 00:53:40,747
Don't thank me.

1087
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,548
Some of us still
believe in the Constitution.

1088
00:53:44,249 --> 00:53:47,487
And remember, this is
not a town hall meeting,

1089
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,221
this is a trial.

1090
00:53:49,254 --> 00:53:50,923
Answer the questions.

1091
00:53:50,957 --> 00:53:53,526
Your opinions are of no
concern to the court.

1092
00:53:55,728 --> 00:53:56,896
Proceed.

1093
00:54:00,633 --> 00:54:04,871
That's not a very positive
picture of the future.

1094
00:54:04,904 --> 00:54:06,706
Why should anyone believe you?

1095
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:10,576
Because they know it's true.

1096
00:54:12,745 --> 00:54:15,313
In their gut,
they know it's true.

1097
00:54:17,249 --> 00:54:18,685
They just don't
want to believe it.

1098
00:54:19,452 --> 00:54:21,754
They can't imagine
it could be happening,

1099
00:54:21,788 --> 00:54:26,793
not in America, but every
red flag is flying high.

1100
00:54:26,826 --> 00:54:29,862
Some will never admit it,
but I know it.

1101
00:54:31,597 --> 00:54:34,500
Instead of believing in
the ideals of their country,

1102
00:54:34,534 --> 00:54:37,870
they believed in him
because he told them to,

1103
00:54:37,904 --> 00:54:40,606
he told them what to believe
and when to believe it.

1104
00:54:41,306 --> 00:54:42,307
Now he can't.

1105
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:46,746
Time will tell if
they ever come to their senses.

1106
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:49,347
History will be their judge.

1107
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:52,618
Let's hope they do.

1108
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,422
If the President
was so dangerous,

1109
00:54:57,457 --> 00:55:00,392
why not travel back to
the time before he got elected

1110
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:02,260
and stop it
before he got started?

1111
00:55:02,294 --> 00:55:05,330
We debated that,
but in the end,

1112
00:55:05,363 --> 00:55:07,533
we realized he could
serve a purpose.

1113
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:10,368
It could be a wake-up
call to the world.

1114
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:14,674
Kind of like the bombing
of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

1115
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:19,011
We thought if you could get
a glimpse of the destruction

1116
00:55:19,045 --> 00:55:21,013
he could cause
with the power of

1117
00:55:21,047 --> 00:55:23,716
the United States presidency,
you might work more diligently

1118
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,852
to see that it would
never happen again.

1119
00:55:25,885 --> 00:55:28,588
With him gone,
we hope the world will realize

1120
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:30,623
what it almost lost
and work harder

1121
00:55:30,656 --> 00:55:32,692
to achieve positive things.

1122
00:55:32,725 --> 00:55:34,927
We hope it unleashes
a wave of goodwill

1123
00:55:34,961 --> 00:55:37,530
and optimism and cooperation.

1124
00:55:37,563 --> 00:55:41,299
We hope the world unites
instead of divides.

1125
00:55:43,603 --> 00:55:44,704
It has to.

1126
00:55:45,738 --> 00:55:47,640
Our future is at stake.

1127
00:55:50,543 --> 00:55:53,079
Near the end of the
prosecution's case,

1128
00:55:53,112 --> 00:55:55,014
you stated that
you wanted to change

1129
00:55:55,047 --> 00:55:57,550
your plea to self-defense.

1130
00:55:58,484 --> 00:56:00,586
Can you explain
what you meant by that?

1131
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,456
My world was being destroyed
because of his actions.

1132
00:56:03,956 --> 00:56:06,793
My family was destroyed
because of his actions.

1133
00:56:06,826 --> 00:56:10,496
I was about to be destroyed
because of his actions.

1134
00:56:10,863 --> 00:56:12,899
How were you
about to be destroyed?

1135
00:56:12,932 --> 00:56:14,033
I'm a scientist.

1136
00:56:15,034 --> 00:56:17,003
I was charged with being
an enemy of the people.

1137
00:56:18,004 --> 00:56:19,739
It's a charge he perfected.

1138
00:56:19,772 --> 00:56:21,507
Was he still president?

1139
00:56:21,908 --> 00:56:23,509
No.

1140
00:56:23,543 --> 00:56:25,343
He died 20 years ago
in my world.

1141
00:56:25,711 --> 00:56:29,982
But his son took over and was
even more destructive and vile.

1142
00:56:32,552 --> 00:56:34,854
When lies become the truth

1143
00:56:35,922 --> 00:56:38,524
and the truth becomes lies,

1144
00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:41,627
democracy dies.

1145
00:56:42,862 --> 00:56:46,899
He was on the verge of
killing democracy forever.

1146
00:56:46,933 --> 00:56:48,534
And if that happened,
the world as you know

1147
00:56:48,568 --> 00:56:50,136
it would cease to exist

1148
00:56:50,169 --> 00:56:52,471
and the world I grew up
in would be born.

1149
00:56:52,505 --> 00:56:54,707
A world where science
is considered a cult

1150
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,109
and those who practice it
are subject to termination.

1151
00:56:58,044 --> 00:56:59,745
What do you mean
by termination?

1152
00:56:59,779 --> 00:57:01,413
Shot on sight.

1153
00:57:02,048 --> 00:57:04,116
I don't understand,
why scientists?

1154
00:57:05,785 --> 00:57:07,854
Scientists predicted
the devastating role

1155
00:57:07,887 --> 00:57:10,422
a changing
climate could have on Earth.

1156
00:57:10,456 --> 00:57:11,991
It came true.

1157
00:57:12,024 --> 00:57:13,893
Your president
called it a hoax.

1158
00:57:13,926 --> 00:57:15,728
It was easier to believe that

1159
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:17,964
it was a hoax than to do
something to try to stop it.

1160
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:20,066
So when it came true,

1161
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:21,601
it had to be discounted.

1162
00:57:21,634 --> 00:57:23,069
The best way to discount it

1163
00:57:23,102 --> 00:57:25,671
is to discount the
messengers of truth.

1164
00:57:25,705 --> 00:57:27,573
We were targeted for removal.

1165
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,910
To survive,
science was forced underground.

1166
00:57:31,477 --> 00:57:32,979
Both my parents
were scientists,

1167
00:57:33,012 --> 00:57:34,580
they were leaders
in their field.

1168
00:57:34,614 --> 00:57:36,182
My mother graduated
from Harvard

1169
00:57:36,215 --> 00:57:37,984
with a PhD in astrophysics.

1170
00:57:38,017 --> 00:57:39,652
My father from MIT

1171
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:41,954
with a PhD in
environmental science.

1172
00:57:41,988 --> 00:57:44,590
They worked in a diner
to avoid being discovered.

1173
00:57:44,624 --> 00:57:46,826
One day they were discovered...

1174
00:57:49,795 --> 00:57:51,063
And they disappeared.

1175
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:54,734
Do you know what it's like

1176
00:57:54,767 --> 00:57:57,103
to have your parents
just disappear?

1177
00:58:02,475 --> 00:58:03,876
What about you?

1178
00:58:04,944 --> 00:58:06,646
I was a concrete finisher.

1179
00:58:07,647 --> 00:58:09,148
And a scientist?

1180
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:12,518
Yes.
I'm part of the resistance.

1181
00:58:13,185 --> 00:58:14,787
We meet in abandoned malls.

1182
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,656
The machine that
sent me back here

1183
00:58:16,689 --> 00:58:18,691
was built in the basement
of the Mall of America.

1184
00:58:18,724 --> 00:58:20,126
Your Honor,
how long will you make us

1185
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:21,827
listen to this insanity?

1186
00:58:21,861 --> 00:58:23,562
I suggest you button it up,
Mr. Bradley,

1187
00:58:23,596 --> 00:58:24,664
you'll get your turn.

1188
00:58:24,697 --> 00:58:26,098
But this is ludicrous.

1189
00:58:26,132 --> 00:58:28,567
No, it's the
defendant's testimony.

1190
00:58:29,068 --> 00:58:31,237
The court recognizes
that it's highly unusual,

1191
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,539
but there's nothing
usual about the crimes

1192
00:58:33,572 --> 00:58:35,207
this man is charged
with committing.

1193
00:58:35,675 --> 00:58:36,742
So we will hear him out

1194
00:58:37,276 --> 00:58:40,046
as long as his testimony
is relevant to his defense.

1195
00:58:40,746 --> 00:58:42,515
And I suggest you do the same.

1196
00:58:42,548 --> 00:58:44,016
Unless he says something that

1197
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:46,619
you have a legitimate
legal objection to.

1198
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:47,853
It's just...

1199
00:58:47,887 --> 00:58:50,456
Yes, it is.

1200
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:53,759
Please proceed, Mr. Johnson.

1201
00:58:53,793 --> 00:58:55,227
Thank you, Your Honor.

1202
00:58:55,261 --> 00:58:58,564
Um, you said that
you were targeted.

1203
00:58:59,598 --> 00:59:01,000
Was anyone else
targeted like that?

1204
00:59:01,033 --> 00:59:03,002
The media is
under attack today.

1205
00:59:03,569 --> 00:59:06,706
The truth is under attack
wherever it comes from.

1206
00:59:06,973 --> 00:59:09,875
And yes,
the media was targeted

1207
00:59:09,909 --> 00:59:12,011
and eventually
journalists were terminated.

1208
00:59:12,678 --> 00:59:16,082
But they weren't
the first to go.

1209
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:17,950
Who was first?

1210
00:59:19,652 --> 00:59:20,720
Attorneys.

1211
00:59:22,121 --> 00:59:23,923
Why attorneys?

1212
00:59:24,623 --> 00:59:26,792
To undermine the rule of law

1213
00:59:26,826 --> 00:59:28,894
and the media
helped fuel the fire.

1214
00:59:28,928 --> 00:59:31,964
People loved stories of
attorneys going to jail,

1215
00:59:31,998 --> 00:59:34,734
big ratings, and no one
stood up for them.

1216
00:59:35,134 --> 00:59:37,069
Once attorneys were gone,
journalists were next.

1217
00:59:37,103 --> 00:59:38,904
There were no attorneys left
to defend them.

1218
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:41,607
Then scientists, then artists.

1219
00:59:42,608 --> 00:59:45,277
Eventually, as time went on,

1220
00:59:45,311 --> 00:59:47,079
anyone who presented
a threat to the regime

1221
00:59:47,113 --> 00:59:48,914
was called a traitor
and targeted.

1222
00:59:48,948 --> 00:59:51,250
Once you're targeted,
a bounty is placed on you.

1223
00:59:51,283 --> 00:59:54,620
Anyone can turn you in
or kill you for it.

1224
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:56,922
Anyone.

1225
00:59:57,623 --> 01:00:01,627
So we live in constant
fear of our neighbors,

1226
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,963
our coworkers, our friends,

1227
01:00:03,996 --> 01:00:06,532
anyone who's not a
part of the resistance.

1228
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,335
Was there bounty on you?

1229
01:00:09,368 --> 01:00:10,770
Yes, of course.

1230
01:00:10,803 --> 01:00:11,871
How much?

1231
01:00:12,304 --> 01:00:15,875
In your world,
it would be about $50.

1232
01:00:15,908 --> 01:00:17,676
Fifty dollars?

1233
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:19,211
When you cheapen
the value of life,

1234
01:00:19,245 --> 01:00:21,113
it becomes easier to destroy.

1235
01:00:21,947 --> 01:00:23,749
Everything is disposable.

1236
01:00:25,017 --> 01:00:26,786
The destruction
of your institutions

1237
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:27,987
became a way of life.

1238
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,022
Things like public education,

1239
01:00:30,256 --> 01:00:33,025
your intelligence,
and environmental agencies.

1240
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:34,760
Even the appellate court,

1241
01:00:35,094 --> 01:00:38,764
one by one gone,
became the norm.

1242
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,568
He was even working
on religion.

1243
01:00:43,636 --> 01:00:45,171
Didn't like the competition.

1244
01:00:46,672 --> 01:00:49,041
Your institutions
didn't disappear

1245
01:00:49,075 --> 01:00:51,110
because of new
technologies or competition,

1246
01:00:51,677 --> 01:00:55,648
they disappeared because they
threatened his regime.

1247
01:00:56,182 --> 01:00:57,716
He saw them as the enemy.

1248
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:01,720
You mentioned your parents,
did you have any other family?

1249
01:01:01,754 --> 01:01:03,823
No.
It's one of the reasons

1250
01:01:03,856 --> 01:01:05,257
I was chosen to go
on this mission.

1251
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:06,992
We knew
I was never coming back.

1252
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,361
What's another one?

1253
01:01:10,296 --> 01:01:12,064
I was drafted into the military

1254
01:01:12,098 --> 01:01:13,332
when I was younger
and trained as a sniper.

1255
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:15,634
Drafted?

1256
01:01:16,001 --> 01:01:19,138
Yes. He started so many
wars around the world

1257
01:01:19,171 --> 01:01:20,873
that the draft
had to be reinstated.

1258
01:01:21,707 --> 01:01:22,942
After his re-election,

1259
01:01:22,975 --> 01:01:24,844
your world never
saw peace again.

1260
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:28,380
Now you have a chance at it.

1261
01:01:30,749 --> 01:01:32,852
When you decided to go
on this mission

1262
01:01:33,252 --> 01:01:35,321
and knew you couldn't return,
did you think about

1263
01:01:35,354 --> 01:01:37,690
what might happen to you
if you were successful?

1264
01:01:37,723 --> 01:01:38,924
Yes.

1265
01:01:40,092 --> 01:01:42,728
We knew I'd either be caught
or killed in the process.

1266
01:01:42,761 --> 01:01:44,163
And if you were caught,

1267
01:01:44,196 --> 01:01:45,898
what did you think
would happen to you?

1268
01:01:47,366 --> 01:01:48,701
I'd be terminated.

1269
01:01:49,835 --> 01:01:53,739
So knowing you couldn't return
and you most likely die,

1270
01:01:53,973 --> 01:01:55,374
you still chose to do this?

1271
01:01:56,175 --> 01:01:57,810
- Yes.
- Why?

1272
01:01:57,843 --> 01:01:59,178
We had no choice.

1273
01:01:59,211 --> 01:02:01,080
It was a suicide mission.

1274
01:02:01,113 --> 01:02:02,181
Yes.

1275
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:04,917
Do you want to die?

1276
01:02:05,951 --> 01:02:07,019
No.

1277
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:10,422
Do you have a terminal illness?

1278
01:02:10,457 --> 01:02:11,657
No.

1279
01:02:12,324 --> 01:02:14,093
Our world was terminal.

1280
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,729
I was the best option.

1281
01:02:19,398 --> 01:02:22,034
Do you truly think
you've saved the world?

1282
01:02:23,402 --> 01:02:24,837
No.

1283
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:28,307
I made a course correction,
a reboot.

1284
01:02:29,175 --> 01:02:32,111
You were on a different
path before he was elected.

1285
01:02:32,912 --> 01:02:34,481
Now you have a chance
to get there.

1286
01:02:34,514 --> 01:02:36,081
It doesn't mean you will.

1287
01:02:36,449 --> 01:02:40,085
What happens next is up to you
and the rest of the world.

1288
01:02:40,953 --> 01:02:43,889
What do you mean by a
different path that we were on?

1289
01:02:43,923 --> 01:02:46,158
There was worldwide cooperation

1290
01:02:46,192 --> 01:02:48,727
on protecting the planet
from climate change.

1291
01:02:49,395 --> 01:02:52,465
We're hoping we're not too late
and that that's still possible.

1292
01:02:53,766 --> 01:02:55,100
I bet my life on it.

1293
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:58,471
There was a global economy

1294
01:02:58,505 --> 01:03:01,974
where countries were
reliant on one another

1295
01:03:02,007 --> 01:03:04,043
and cooperated
and created new industries

1296
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:06,278
where growth was
ongoing and sustainable.

1297
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:08,013
Renewable energy was poised

1298
01:03:08,047 --> 01:03:10,049
to become the next
industrial revolution.

1299
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:12,785
That can happen now.

1300
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:17,923
Countries around
the world embraced science

1301
01:03:17,957 --> 01:03:20,226
and worked together
to maintain peace,

1302
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:25,030
to fight tyrants, to fight
terrorists, to fight injustice.

1303
01:03:25,898 --> 01:03:27,933
That's an entirely
different path

1304
01:03:27,967 --> 01:03:30,102
from the one you've been
on since he was elected.

1305
01:03:31,904 --> 01:03:33,372
I hope you succeed.

1306
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:36,942
My world depends on it.

1307
01:03:42,414 --> 01:03:44,984
I think that may be
a good place to stop.

1308
01:03:46,085 --> 01:03:48,187
Is there anything else
you want to tell the jury?

1309
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:51,824
Yes.

1310
01:03:52,157 --> 01:03:54,461
[inhaling and exhaling deeply]

1311
01:03:54,494 --> 01:03:56,195
One week from today,

1312
01:03:56,228 --> 01:03:58,330
there will be an
earthquake in Bangkok,

1313
01:03:58,364 --> 01:04:02,067
8,428 people will die.

1314
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:03,902
Temperature in Duluth,
Minnesota

1315
01:04:03,936 --> 01:04:05,904
will be a high of
73 degrees and a low of 65.

1316
01:04:05,938 --> 01:04:08,274
And the tide
will crest at sunrise

1317
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:10,209
at four feet in Rio de Janeiro.

1318
01:04:10,242 --> 01:04:11,143
Objection.
That is blatant conjecture.

1319
01:04:11,176 --> 01:04:12,845
Sustained.

1320
01:04:12,878 --> 01:04:14,880
Jurors,
you are to disregard

1321
01:04:14,913 --> 01:04:16,449
that last statement
from the defendant.

1322
01:04:16,483 --> 01:04:18,451
Please strike the
testimony from the record.

1323
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:21,186
Please proceed, Mr. Johnson.

1324
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,956
Your Honor, we're done with
our testimony for today.

1325
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:26,593
I'd like to reserve the right
to question my client again.

1326
01:04:26,626 --> 01:04:29,028
Duly noted.
Take your seat, please.

1327
01:04:30,195 --> 01:04:32,398
[chains clanging]

1328
01:04:34,266 --> 01:04:36,835
Okay, then I think
we'll call it a day and begin

1329
01:04:36,869 --> 01:04:38,404
cross-examination
tomorrow morning.

1330
01:04:38,438 --> 01:04:40,540
- Is that okay with you?
- Yes. Your Honor.

1331
01:04:40,573 --> 01:04:42,274
We're ready
whenever you wish.

1332
01:04:42,308 --> 01:04:43,510
Very well then.

1333
01:04:43,543 --> 01:04:45,177
I'd like to remind the jury

1334
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:46,345
that they've been
sequestered for a reason.

1335
01:04:47,447 --> 01:04:49,549
You're not allowed to watch TV,
read the newspaper,

1336
01:04:49,582 --> 01:04:51,618
or expose yourselves
in any way to coverage

1337
01:04:51,651 --> 01:04:53,385
of this trial
via the media,

1338
01:04:53,419 --> 01:04:55,354
social media,
or through your relationships.

1339
01:04:55,622 --> 01:04:58,090
We'll reconvene at
9:00 AM tomorrow morning.

1340
01:04:58,123 --> 01:05:01,160
[dramatic music playing]

1341
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,437
[papers shuffling]

1342
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:13,939
Gordon Nicholson
doesn't check out.

1343
01:05:13,972 --> 01:05:16,008
Nothing checks out
about this guy.

1344
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:18,077
- That was something.
- Yeah.

1345
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:20,379
I couldn't get a
handle on the jury.

1346
01:05:20,412 --> 01:05:22,081
No kidding.

1347
01:05:22,114 --> 01:05:23,882
Well, do you think
he's telling the truth?

1348
01:05:24,517 --> 01:05:26,251
You know,
whatever he's telling,

1349
01:05:26,285 --> 01:05:28,020
he sure seems
to believe it, so.

1350
01:05:28,053 --> 01:05:30,322
Or he puts
Charles Manson to shame.

1351
01:05:30,356 --> 01:05:31,957
That's what I'm afraid of.

1352
01:05:33,158 --> 01:05:36,228
Or maybe he's just
that good of an actor.

1353
01:05:37,564 --> 01:05:39,365
Well, John Wilkes Booth
was pretty good.

1354
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,067
Did you send her the testimony?

1355
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:43,503
Yes.

1356
01:05:59,385 --> 01:06:02,421
[exhaling deeply]

1357
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:13,966
[brooding pensive music]

1358
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:07,986
[dramatic melancholic playing]

1359
01:08:01,608 --> 01:08:02,775
Have a seat.

1360
01:08:15,488 --> 01:08:17,256
I wanted to talk to you

1361
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:19,191
about Bradley's
cross-examination today.

1362
01:08:19,692 --> 01:08:21,159
Looking forward to it.

1363
01:08:21,193 --> 01:08:23,463
Yeah. Bet you are.

1364
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:26,231
But I wanted to talk about
something else first.

1365
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:28,233
Shoot.

1366
01:08:28,267 --> 01:08:30,302
What was your
father's first name?

1367
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:35,808
George.

1368
01:08:39,445 --> 01:08:41,213
Are you sure?

1369
01:08:41,246 --> 01:08:43,550
Pretty sure
I know my father's name.

1370
01:08:46,519 --> 01:08:50,790
Just so you know,
my parents are off-limits.

1371
01:08:50,823 --> 01:08:52,825
Their lives cannot
be interfered with.

1372
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:54,627
It could change
the course of history.

1373
01:08:54,661 --> 01:08:56,629
They need to live their lives

1374
01:08:56,663 --> 01:09:02,100
normally wherever they are
or else I might not be born.

1375
01:09:02,835 --> 01:09:07,172
I could disappear
right in front of your eyes.

1376
01:09:09,876 --> 01:09:11,778
That might be a good thing.

1377
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,147
I'd rather not find out.

1378
01:09:16,381 --> 01:09:18,618
And your country
would rather not find out.

1379
01:09:19,351 --> 01:09:21,788
Please, forget about them.

1380
01:09:23,322 --> 01:09:24,624
And you really believe that?

1381
01:09:24,657 --> 01:09:25,825
Don't you?

1382
01:09:27,225 --> 01:09:28,360
Don't you?

1383
01:09:30,597 --> 01:09:32,565
I don't know what to believe.

1384
01:09:33,499 --> 01:09:36,234
Good.
The jury won't either.

1385
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,341
Leave my parents alone.

1386
01:09:54,186 --> 01:09:57,289
[crowd yelling]

1387
01:10:06,566 --> 01:10:09,267
All they need
is one X-Files fan.

1388
01:10:10,235 --> 01:10:13,138
Didn't think about that
during jury selection.

1389
01:10:13,539 --> 01:10:14,607
[clearing throat]

1390
01:10:16,476 --> 01:10:18,811
I think you better start
thinking about a plea deal.

1391
01:10:19,612 --> 01:10:21,648
Do you want to take the
death penalty off the table?

1392
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,816
I think you better
start thinking

1393
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:25,317
about getting disbarred.

1394
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,219
We're gonna fry his ass.

1395
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,888
You think he's insane,
don't you?

1396
01:10:29,822 --> 01:10:31,591
And if you think he's crazy,

1397
01:10:31,624 --> 01:10:33,593
what do you think
the jury thinks?

1398
01:10:33,993 --> 01:10:35,695
I don't think he's crazy.

1399
01:10:35,728 --> 01:10:37,262
You must be though.

1400
01:10:37,664 --> 01:10:39,532
He's just a liar and a con.

1401
01:10:40,232 --> 01:10:41,434
Believe what you want.

1402
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:44,302
You're sure you want
to take that chance?

1403
01:10:45,738 --> 01:10:47,940
All I need is one
Trekkie on the jury.

1404
01:10:48,574 --> 01:10:50,510
All I need is
one lie out of you

1405
01:10:50,543 --> 01:10:52,478
and you can kiss
your license goodbye.

1406
01:10:52,512 --> 01:10:54,547
Your client is all mine today.

1407
01:10:57,016 --> 01:10:58,718
Just think about it.

1408
01:11:04,322 --> 01:11:07,760
[chains clanging]

1409
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:19,772
All rise.

1410
01:11:24,844 --> 01:11:25,945
You may be seated.

1411
01:11:27,647 --> 01:11:29,749
Hope everyone
had a relaxing evening.

1412
01:11:29,782 --> 01:11:30,950
I believe it's your turn,
Mr. Bradley.

1413
01:11:30,983 --> 01:11:32,485
Thank you, Your Honor.

1414
01:11:32,518 --> 01:11:33,886
I'd like to recall
the defendant,

1415
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,387
John Doe to the stand.

1416
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,789
Mr. Doe, please be seated.

1417
01:11:49,769 --> 01:11:51,269
You are still
sworn in from yesterday.

1418
01:11:51,303 --> 01:11:52,605
Do you understand?

1419
01:11:52,638 --> 01:11:53,773
Yes, Your Honor.

1420
01:11:56,943 --> 01:11:58,911
Now, before we get started,

1421
01:11:58,945 --> 01:12:02,482
I just have to say that your
testimony so far has just been

1422
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:06,384
the wildest charade
that I have ever experienced.

1423
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,888
Wow, oh, wow.

1424
01:12:08,921 --> 01:12:11,691
You can really tell a story.

1425
01:12:11,724 --> 01:12:15,628
I mean, [chuckling]
corporate pilot, Navy SEAL.

1426
01:12:15,661 --> 01:12:19,031
Oh, and my favorite Future Man.

1427
01:12:19,065 --> 01:12:21,467
So congratulations on that.

1428
01:12:21,501 --> 01:12:23,603
Just amazing.

1429
01:12:23,636 --> 01:12:28,306
Now, Mr. Doe,
or is it Mr. Nicholson,

1430
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:29,909
or... or maybe you'd like
to be somebody else today.

1431
01:12:29,942 --> 01:12:31,844
What would you like me
to call you?

1432
01:12:31,878 --> 01:12:33,579
My name is Gordon Nicholson.

1433
01:12:33,613 --> 01:12:36,381
You may call me whatever
you like, Mr. Bradley.

1434
01:12:36,414 --> 01:12:39,351
Well, we did a background
check on Gordon Nicholson

1435
01:12:39,384 --> 01:12:41,821
and I have to tell you,
none of the Gordon Nicholsons

1436
01:12:41,854 --> 01:12:44,457
we could find seemed
to match up with you.

1437
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,058
Why do you think that is?

1438
01:12:46,092 --> 01:12:47,527
Objection.
Leading the witness.

1439
01:12:47,894 --> 01:12:49,427
I'll rephrase that, Your Honor.

1440
01:12:49,996 --> 01:12:51,898
Do you realize you're
committing perjury

1441
01:12:51,931 --> 01:12:53,432
with your testimony
in this court?

1442
01:12:53,866 --> 01:12:55,067
I'm telling the truth.

1443
01:12:55,635 --> 01:12:57,335
You just don't want to hear it.

1444
01:12:57,369 --> 01:12:58,738
I'll tell you
what I want to hear.

1445
01:12:59,071 --> 01:13:01,040
Why did you make up
another name for yourself?

1446
01:13:01,073 --> 01:13:02,642
What are you trying to hide?

1447
01:13:03,009 --> 01:13:06,879
There are no records on me
because I haven't been born.

1448
01:13:06,913 --> 01:13:11,050
Oh, right.
Future Man, the time traveler.

1449
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:12,985
Well, Future Man,

1450
01:13:13,686 --> 01:13:15,655
who's going to win
the lottery tomorrow?

1451
01:13:15,688 --> 01:13:17,422
I don't know.

1452
01:13:17,456 --> 01:13:20,026
Don't know.
Well, wh... why don't you know?

1453
01:13:20,059 --> 01:13:21,594
I thought you could
predict the future?

1454
01:13:21,627 --> 01:13:22,995
I'm not a psychic.

1455
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:24,463
I'm a historian.

1456
01:13:24,497 --> 01:13:25,798
A historian.

1457
01:13:25,832 --> 01:13:27,767
Terrific.
Let me get this straight.

1458
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,871
A corporate pilot,
Navy SEAL, and historian.

1459
01:13:31,904 --> 01:13:34,540
Yes. Oh, and let's not
forget the big one,

1460
01:13:35,074 --> 01:13:38,010
time traveler
sent to save us all.

1461
01:13:38,678 --> 01:13:40,746
Well, Mr. Time Traveler,

1462
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:43,983
tell me, do you own
a flux capacitor?

1463
01:13:44,984 --> 01:13:47,720
What's a flux capacitor?

1464
01:13:47,753 --> 01:13:49,589
How about a DeLorean.

1465
01:13:50,723 --> 01:13:52,124
I don't understand
the question.

1466
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:54,861
Haven't you seen
Back to the Future?

1467
01:13:55,628 --> 01:13:57,163
Is it a movie?

1468
01:13:57,196 --> 01:14:01,000
Yes. About returning
from the future,

1469
01:14:01,033 --> 01:14:03,903
and the flux capacitor
was absolutely critical

1470
01:14:03,936 --> 01:14:05,972
to their ability to
travel through time.

1471
01:14:06,005 --> 01:14:09,175
So you mean to say that
you've traveled through time

1472
01:14:09,208 --> 01:14:12,011
and you don't know
what a flux capacitor is?

1473
01:14:12,044 --> 01:14:14,046
What kind of
time traveler are you?

1474
01:14:14,881 --> 01:14:16,616
A successful one.

1475
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:19,518
No. An imaginary one,

1476
01:14:19,552 --> 01:14:21,153
just like the movie.

1477
01:14:21,187 --> 01:14:23,856
I'll grant you.
You have quite an imagination.

1478
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:25,691
You could've had a
future in Hollywood

1479
01:14:25,725 --> 01:14:28,194
making up grandiose
science fiction stories.

1480
01:14:28,227 --> 01:14:30,930
It's too bad you
chose to assassinate

1481
01:14:30,963 --> 01:14:33,933
the President of the
United States instead.

1482
01:14:33,966 --> 01:14:36,035
It's too bad.
You chose to be

1483
01:14:36,068 --> 01:14:38,804
Lee Harvey Oswald instead
of Steven Spielberg.

1484
01:14:38,838 --> 01:14:41,140
Oswald was from the future.

1485
01:14:41,173 --> 01:14:43,009
Oswald was from the future.

1486
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:44,510
Of course.

1487
01:14:44,543 --> 01:14:46,045
Why didn't anyone
think of that?

1488
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:48,147
They didn't get the chance.

1489
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:49,916
There was never a trial.

1490
01:14:49,949 --> 01:14:52,451
Did Oswald have
a flux capacitor?

1491
01:14:52,485 --> 01:14:55,655
No, he used the prototype
of the machine I used.

1492
01:14:55,688 --> 01:14:56,923
Your Honor,
how much of this lunacy

1493
01:14:56,956 --> 01:14:58,557
do we have
to put up with?

1494
01:14:58,591 --> 01:15:00,593
Are you suggesting
my client is crazy?

1495
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:03,129
Yes.
Are you suggesting something?

1496
01:15:03,162 --> 01:15:04,997
No, Your Honor.

1497
01:15:05,031 --> 01:15:06,565
Then proceed.

1498
01:15:06,599 --> 01:15:08,901
Okay. Love to.

1499
01:15:08,935 --> 01:15:10,770
I think
we've given Mr. Doe here

1500
01:15:10,803 --> 01:15:12,939
ample time for his
flights of fancy.

1501
01:15:12,972 --> 01:15:14,807
I'd like to move on.

1502
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,576
Mr. Doe
or how about Marty McFly,

1503
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:18,978
[crowd giggling]

1504
01:15:19,011 --> 01:15:21,147
how did you feel
about our president?

1505
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:23,716
- I didn't know him.
- Did you hate him?

1506
01:15:23,749 --> 01:15:25,918
I didn't have
any feelings for him.

1507
01:15:25,952 --> 01:15:27,853
Why did you kill him?

1508
01:15:27,887 --> 01:15:30,690
His actions would destroy me
and the rest of the world.

1509
01:15:30,723 --> 01:15:32,591
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

1510
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:34,694
You were on a mission

1511
01:15:34,727 --> 01:15:36,796
- with clear intent, yes?
- Yes.

1512
01:15:36,829 --> 01:15:39,932
Would you say that your intent
was to destroy this country?

1513
01:15:39,966 --> 01:15:41,600
No, the opposite.

1514
01:15:41,634 --> 01:15:43,636
Are you aware that
there are riots happening

1515
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:45,204
in the street as we speak?

1516
01:15:45,237 --> 01:15:47,840
Are you aware that this
country is coming apart?

1517
01:15:47,873 --> 01:15:49,275
Was that your intent?

1518
01:15:49,308 --> 01:15:51,077
No, but we knew there would be

1519
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:54,814
a high probability rate
for internal strife.

1520
01:15:54,847 --> 01:15:57,883
Internal strife.

1521
01:15:57,917 --> 01:16:01,687
People are dying every day in
the streets because of you.

1522
01:16:01,721 --> 01:16:03,889
This is not some fantasy world.

1523
01:16:03,923 --> 01:16:05,124
This is real.

1524
01:16:06,058 --> 01:16:08,661
So that was not your intent?

1525
01:16:09,829 --> 01:16:10,896
Correct.

1526
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:12,131
But you had clear intent. Yes?

1527
01:16:12,164 --> 01:16:13,299
Yes.

1528
01:16:13,332 --> 01:16:15,935
- To save the world.
- Yes.

1529
01:16:15,968 --> 01:16:18,237
You knew this could happen
and you did it anyway.

1530
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:21,273
You survived a civil war.
You'll survive this.

1531
01:16:21,307 --> 01:16:23,309
Oh, yeah, Future Man again.

1532
01:16:23,342 --> 01:16:25,244
Well, Future Man,

1533
01:16:25,277 --> 01:16:26,879
you're not just an assassin.

1534
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:29,115
You're a terrorist.

1535
01:16:29,148 --> 01:16:31,217
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1536
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,885
Fits the definition.

1537
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:36,622
Do you remember
the video we played?

1538
01:16:36,655 --> 01:16:37,723
Yes.

1539
01:16:37,757 --> 01:16:39,125
Was that you in the video?

1540
01:16:39,158 --> 01:16:40,292
It looked like me.

1541
01:16:40,326 --> 01:16:42,128
- But was it you?
- Yes.

1542
01:16:42,161 --> 01:16:44,330
So you don't deny
killing the president?

1543
01:16:44,363 --> 01:16:45,931
I would not deny that, no.

1544
01:16:45,965 --> 01:16:47,900
Did you kill the president?

1545
01:16:47,933 --> 01:16:49,301
- Yes.
- Why?

1546
01:16:49,335 --> 01:16:52,638
I told you,
to protect the world.

1547
01:16:52,671 --> 01:16:54,306
You believe
he had to be stopped?

1548
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:55,641
Yes.

1549
01:16:55,674 --> 01:16:58,077
So you purchased
a sniper rifle,

1550
01:16:58,110 --> 01:17:00,079
rented an apartment,
and then waited for the

1551
01:17:00,112 --> 01:17:01,614
president to go
to one of his rallies?

1552
01:17:01,647 --> 01:17:03,716
- Objection.
- I'll rephrase that.

1553
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:06,352
Did you purchase a sniper
rifle, rent an apartment,

1554
01:17:06,385 --> 01:17:08,687
and wait for the president
to go to one of his rallies?

1555
01:17:08,721 --> 01:17:09,822
Yes.

1556
01:17:09,855 --> 01:17:11,190
Did you shoot the president

1557
01:17:11,223 --> 01:17:13,359
and Agent Winslow
with intent to kill?

1558
01:17:13,392 --> 01:17:15,227
Not Agent Winslow.

1559
01:17:15,261 --> 01:17:17,229
He was innocent, but I had
to shoot him in the leg

1560
01:17:17,263 --> 01:17:19,098
to give me a clear shot
on the president.

1561
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:21,167
Did you shoot the president
with intent to kill him?

1562
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,101
Yes.

1563
01:17:22,868 --> 01:17:24,670
Thank you.

1564
01:17:24,703 --> 01:17:26,972
Please note that
the defendant has just

1565
01:17:27,006 --> 01:17:29,341
admitted to
planning out his attack

1566
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:32,078
and to shooting the
president with intent to kill.

1567
01:17:32,111 --> 01:17:36,916
All insanity pleas are based on
the intent to commit the crime.

1568
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:39,852
We've just met
our burden of proof.

1569
01:17:40,653 --> 01:17:42,088
Congratulations.

1570
01:17:43,722 --> 01:17:45,791
We have no further questions,
Your Honor.

1571
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:48,260
Very well. Mr. Johnson?

1572
01:17:48,294 --> 01:17:49,862
Redirect, Your Honor.

1573
01:17:49,895 --> 01:17:51,263
Thank you, Mr. Bradley.

1574
01:17:56,735 --> 01:17:58,938
Okay. I'm confused.

1575
01:17:58,971 --> 01:18:00,906
When Mr. Bradley was asking
his questions,

1576
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:03,976
you mentioned that Lee Harvey
Oswald was from the future.

1577
01:18:04,009 --> 01:18:05,111
Yes.

1578
01:18:05,911 --> 01:18:07,413
That doesn't make sense to me.

1579
01:18:07,447 --> 01:18:09,782
John F. Kennedy was revered.

1580
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:11,650
Why would someone from the
future want

1581
01:18:11,684 --> 01:18:13,853
to assassinate one of our most
respected presidents?

1582
01:18:13,886 --> 01:18:16,088
[Bradley] Objection.
Relevancy, Your Honor.

1583
01:18:16,122 --> 01:18:18,224
The subject was introduced
under Mr. Bradley's cross.

1584
01:18:18,257 --> 01:18:19,925
It was relevant then.

1585
01:18:19,959 --> 01:18:22,328
Overruled. You may proceed.

1586
01:18:22,361 --> 01:18:24,830
Okay. Again, why would
someone from the future

1587
01:18:24,864 --> 01:18:26,999
want to assassinate
President Kennedy?

1588
01:18:27,032 --> 01:18:29,135
To save the world from
destruction.

1589
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:31,270
I don't understand.

1590
01:18:31,303 --> 01:18:34,206
Kennedy would have gone back to
Washington after Dallas.

1591
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,041
News of his affairs
would leak out.

1592
01:18:36,075 --> 01:18:38,344
Marilyn Monroe
had been carrying his child.

1593
01:18:38,377 --> 01:18:40,379
Jackie found out and left him.

1594
01:18:40,412 --> 01:18:42,781
He was wounded politically and
didn't have the moral authority

1595
01:18:42,815 --> 01:18:45,317
to get his civil rights agenda
through Congress.

1596
01:18:45,351 --> 01:18:47,920
The next 20 years of racial
progress never happened.

1597
01:18:47,953 --> 01:18:50,055
No Obama.

1598
01:18:50,089 --> 01:18:52,758
Barry Goldwater won the
Republican primary and went on

1599
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:56,962
to trounce Kennedy in the 1964
presidential election.

1600
01:18:56,996 --> 01:18:58,831
The day Goldwater was sworn in,

1601
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:03,335
he dropped a bomb... a nuclear
bomb on North Vietnam.

1602
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:05,871
China didn't like that.

1603
01:19:05,905 --> 01:19:08,307
They got involved
and Russia, Europe.

1604
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:10,142
We were on the brink of
destruction.

1605
01:19:11,777 --> 01:19:15,448
When Oswald shot Kennedy,
the country mourned.

1606
01:19:15,482 --> 01:19:18,984
His assassination made Kennedy
a tragic hero.

1607
01:19:20,252 --> 01:19:22,721
It gave Johnson the moral
authority

1608
01:19:22,755 --> 01:19:25,224
to get Kennedy's civil rights
agenda through Congress,

1609
01:19:25,257 --> 01:19:29,295
and as destructive as the
Vietnam War became,

1610
01:19:31,397 --> 01:19:33,466
nuclear war was averted.

1611
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,734
The world was saved until now.

1612
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:39,338
So now it's your turn?

1613
01:19:39,371 --> 01:19:40,440
[Amos] Yes.

1614
01:19:42,007 --> 01:19:44,176
Do you really believe
you're from the future?

1615
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:45,277
Yes.

1616
01:19:46,378 --> 01:19:48,781
So what you had to do,

1617
01:19:48,814 --> 01:19:50,883
you had to do?

1618
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:52,051
Yes.

1619
01:19:53,419 --> 01:19:55,287
Would you agree to take
a polygraph test?

1620
01:19:55,321 --> 01:19:56,523
Yes.

1621
01:19:56,556 --> 01:19:57,990
- [Jason] DNA test?
- Yes.

1622
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:01,293
Want to take him up on it?

1623
01:20:01,327 --> 01:20:02,962
[Bradley] We have
a ballistics test.

1624
01:20:02,995 --> 01:20:05,030
Thank you.

1625
01:20:05,064 --> 01:20:06,265
Very well.

1626
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,502
We're done with our testimony,
Your Honor.

1627
01:20:11,103 --> 01:20:12,338
Recross, Your Honor.

1628
01:20:12,371 --> 01:20:13,939
[Judge] Mr. Bradley.

1629
01:20:15,575 --> 01:20:18,277
Well, that was quite a yarn.

1630
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:20,012
Did you just make that up

1631
01:20:20,045 --> 01:20:22,047
or had you thought it all out
ahead of time?

1632
01:20:22,081 --> 01:20:23,949
Ahead of time,
40 years from now.

1633
01:20:23,983 --> 01:20:27,186
Well, what about that wild
story you told your landlord

1634
01:20:27,219 --> 01:20:29,154
about being an airline pilot?

1635
01:20:29,188 --> 01:20:30,956
Was that the truth,

1636
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:33,225
or had you thought that all up
40 years from now?

1637
01:20:33,259 --> 01:20:35,462
No, Mr. Doe.

1638
01:20:35,495 --> 01:20:37,096
I think you've got

1639
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:38,964
a pathological aversion
to the truth.

1640
01:20:39,599 --> 01:20:41,900
I think you like to tell lies

1641
01:20:41,934 --> 01:20:44,136
because in every
story you have told,

1642
01:20:44,169 --> 01:20:47,440
you have not offered
one scintilla of proof.

1643
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:49,975
Nothing.

1644
01:20:50,009 --> 01:20:53,078
Your entire testimony has
been a fabrication, hasn't it?

1645
01:20:53,112 --> 01:20:55,482
No. I can prove it.

1646
01:20:56,348 --> 01:20:59,118
- You can?
- Yes. It's simple.

1647
01:20:59,151 --> 01:21:01,253
How did Oswald know
to get a job

1648
01:21:01,287 --> 01:21:02,988
at the Texas School
Book Depository

1649
01:21:03,022 --> 01:21:06,091
over a month ahead of
Kennedy's trip to Dallas?

1650
01:21:07,026 --> 01:21:09,496
With all of the jobs
available in Dallas,

1651
01:21:09,529 --> 01:21:12,197
why did he decide to look
for a place to work

1652
01:21:12,231 --> 01:21:14,366
with the perfect view
of Kennedy's route

1653
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,269
before anyone knew Kennedy was
going to be there,

1654
01:21:17,303 --> 01:21:19,572
let alone
what his route would be?

1655
01:21:19,606 --> 01:21:22,241
Excuse me. I'm the one
asking the questions.

1656
01:21:22,274 --> 01:21:24,877
They didn't even decide on
his route until the day before.

1657
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:26,412
[Bradley] That's enough.

1658
01:21:26,446 --> 01:21:29,081
How did he know ahead
of time to be right there

1659
01:21:29,114 --> 01:21:31,250
in that location on that day?

1660
01:21:31,283 --> 01:21:32,985
- Your Honor.
- That's enough.

1661
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:35,988
You've investigated
for over half a century

1662
01:21:36,021 --> 01:21:38,558
and theorized about
Kennedy's assassination

1663
01:21:38,591 --> 01:21:40,426
when you've ignored the
evidence that's been staring

1664
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:42,027
you in the face
the entire time?

1665
01:21:42,061 --> 01:21:43,630
- Now!
- How did he know to be there?

1666
01:21:43,663 --> 01:21:45,230
Who cares?

1667
01:21:45,264 --> 01:21:46,566
That was then.

1668
01:21:46,599 --> 01:21:48,535
We're dealing with the here
and now.

1669
01:21:48,568 --> 01:21:51,170
The here and now where
you assassinated

1670
01:21:51,203 --> 01:21:53,540
the President of
the United States,

1671
01:21:53,573 --> 01:21:55,575
not Lee Harvey Oswald, you.

1672
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:59,411
This is not some
alternate universe.

1673
01:21:59,446 --> 01:22:01,180
You didn't beam yourself
into that chair

1674
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:03,115
and neither did they.

1675
01:22:03,148 --> 01:22:06,519
So how about we forget the
fantasy that you are selling?

1676
01:22:07,986 --> 01:22:12,124
Your entire testimony has
been a complete fabrication.

1677
01:22:13,425 --> 01:22:14,960
How did he know?

1678
01:22:16,195 --> 01:22:18,598
Don't you remember?

1679
01:22:18,631 --> 01:22:21,501
The CIA killed Kennedy.

1680
01:22:21,534 --> 01:22:24,236
Oswald was part of their plan.

1681
01:22:24,269 --> 01:22:25,638
That's how he knew.

1682
01:22:25,672 --> 01:22:27,640
No, wait,
he was with the mafia.

1683
01:22:27,674 --> 01:22:30,209
They killed Kennedy,
or he was an alien,

1684
01:22:30,242 --> 01:22:32,211
or he was a psychic.
No, wait.

1685
01:22:32,244 --> 01:22:33,912
He was playing
with a Ouija board

1686
01:22:33,946 --> 01:22:35,648
and spelled out Book
Depository.

1687
01:22:35,682 --> 01:22:38,585
Do you see how easy this is?

1688
01:22:39,486 --> 01:22:43,222
I'm done with this witness,
Your Honor.

1689
01:22:44,056 --> 01:22:46,258
Okay. Mr. Doe,
please be seated.

1690
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:52,699
[chains clanging]

1691
01:22:52,732 --> 01:22:54,534
How?

1692
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:02,040
We have one more witness,
your Honor.

1693
01:23:02,074 --> 01:23:03,643
Objection.

1694
01:23:03,676 --> 01:23:05,277
He hasn't submitted
anyone to the witness list.

1695
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:07,045
She was one of yours.

1696
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:09,616
Dr. Amanda Beal,
your mental health expert,

1697
01:23:09,649 --> 01:23:11,283
you filed
her report with the court.

1698
01:23:12,184 --> 01:23:13,952
Very well.

1699
01:23:13,986 --> 01:23:15,988
I'd like to call Dr. Amanda
Beal to the stand.

1700
01:23:29,201 --> 01:23:30,402
What the fuck is this?

1701
01:23:30,437 --> 01:23:32,304
I don't know. Did she call you?

1702
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:37,943
You are still sworn in,
Dr. Beal.

1703
01:23:41,581 --> 01:23:43,483
Good afternoon, Dr. Beal.

1704
01:23:44,451 --> 01:23:46,519
Some would say you're
the country's leading expert

1705
01:23:46,553 --> 01:23:50,490
on legal issues as they relate
to psychology, is that correct?

1706
01:23:50,523 --> 01:23:52,459
I'm sorry,
I'm... I'm not comfortable

1707
01:23:52,492 --> 01:23:54,993
commenting on speculation
about my credentials.

1708
01:23:55,027 --> 01:23:56,395
Fair enough.

1709
01:23:56,428 --> 01:23:58,263
Would you mind sharing
your credentials?

1710
01:23:58,297 --> 01:24:00,700
I have a PhD
in clinical psychiatry

1711
01:24:00,733 --> 01:24:03,570
and a PhD in criminal justice,
both from Harvard.

1712
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:05,370
So let's be clear.

1713
01:24:05,404 --> 01:24:07,440
Of all the professionals
in your field

1714
01:24:07,474 --> 01:24:09,208
that the federal government
could pick from

1715
01:24:09,241 --> 01:24:10,777
in the entire country,

1716
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:12,712
the entire world for that
matter, they picked you?

1717
01:24:12,745 --> 01:24:14,012
Yes.

1718
01:24:15,247 --> 01:24:16,749
Are you the psychiatrist
who determined

1719
01:24:16,783 --> 01:24:19,151
that my client was
competent to stand trial?

1720
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:21,019
Yes.

1721
01:24:21,053 --> 01:24:23,456
Did you spend any time with
him in forming your opinion?

1722
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:25,190
Yes, I did.

1723
01:24:25,224 --> 01:24:27,359
I had a couple of sessions
with him actually.

1724
01:24:27,392 --> 01:24:30,062
And your recommendation was
that my client was competent?

1725
01:24:30,095 --> 01:24:31,664
Yes.

1726
01:24:31,698 --> 01:24:34,333
Would you mind sharing
how you reached your decision?

1727
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:37,704
The test for
competency is simple.

1728
01:24:37,737 --> 01:24:41,106
Uh, the defendant must have
the ability to consult

1729
01:24:41,139 --> 01:24:44,611
with his attorney and have
a rational understanding

1730
01:24:44,644 --> 01:24:46,479
of the proceedings
against him or her.

1731
01:24:46,513 --> 01:24:49,682
- Not a high bar?
- No, but some don't need it.

1732
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:52,519
And in your sessions,
did my client mention

1733
01:24:52,552 --> 01:24:54,521
that he was from the future?

1734
01:24:54,554 --> 01:24:56,221
No, he did not.

1735
01:24:56,255 --> 01:24:57,624
He shared very little actually.

1736
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:01,193
You've not been here for
all of the testimony, correct?

1737
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:03,128
Correct.

1738
01:25:03,161 --> 01:25:04,831
Did you receive the
transcripts that my office

1739
01:25:04,864 --> 01:25:06,633
couriered to you
earlier today?

1740
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:08,166
Yes, I did.

1741
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,168
- Did you read them?
- Yes.

1742
01:25:10,202 --> 01:25:12,304
Did you see the part where
he said he was from the future?

1743
01:25:12,337 --> 01:25:14,106
I did.

1744
01:25:14,139 --> 01:25:16,442
And that he believes
he was protecting the world?

1745
01:25:17,443 --> 01:25:19,278
Yes.

1746
01:25:19,311 --> 01:25:22,147
What was your expert opinion
when you read his testimony?

1747
01:25:23,483 --> 01:25:26,719
That he could be delusional or
possibly paranoid delusional.

1748
01:25:26,753 --> 01:25:29,254
And what
exactly does that mean?

1749
01:25:29,288 --> 01:25:33,225
It means that he believes
in an alternate reality

1750
01:25:33,258 --> 01:25:36,328
where things or people
are out to get him.

1751
01:25:36,361 --> 01:25:39,197
Could he believe that
he's from the future

1752
01:25:39,231 --> 01:25:42,435
and that his life and
environment were under attack?

1753
01:25:42,468 --> 01:25:44,269
Yes.

1754
01:25:44,303 --> 01:25:47,239
Would he be in control of his
actions in that reality?

1755
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:51,844
Yes, if his actions
supported his reality.

1756
01:25:51,878 --> 01:25:54,379
- Could he kill?
- Yes.

1757
01:25:54,413 --> 01:25:57,416
- And believe he was justified?
- Yes.

1758
01:25:57,450 --> 01:25:59,619
I'm not delusional.

1759
01:25:59,652 --> 01:26:01,721
What don't
you people understand?

1760
01:26:01,754 --> 01:26:03,489
- [Judge] Mr. Doe.
- I just saved you.

1761
01:26:03,523 --> 01:26:05,491
[Judge] Order.

1762
01:26:05,525 --> 01:26:07,560
Mr. Doe,
or whoever you are,

1763
01:26:07,594 --> 01:26:10,262
I'll have you gagged if you
don't sit down right now.

1764
01:26:10,295 --> 01:26:12,097
I mean that.

1765
01:26:19,939 --> 01:26:20,807
Proceed.

1766
01:26:23,509 --> 01:26:26,679
What are some other things
to watch for?

1767
01:26:28,413 --> 01:26:31,249
Well, uh,
a person can appear normal

1768
01:26:31,283 --> 01:26:34,621
in all other areas
except their delusion.

1769
01:26:34,654 --> 01:26:36,889
[Jason] What do you mean?

1770
01:26:36,923 --> 01:26:40,325
We could be having a normal
conversation and the person

1771
01:26:40,359 --> 01:26:44,396
can say, "The earth is flat,"
and believe it.

1772
01:26:44,429 --> 01:26:46,466
And if someone
suffered from that,

1773
01:26:46,499 --> 01:26:49,334
would they legally be
responsible for their actions?

1774
01:26:49,602 --> 01:26:51,269
No.

1775
01:26:51,303 --> 01:26:54,540
Well, none that are
related to that delusion.

1776
01:26:54,574 --> 01:26:58,544
Um, if you wrecked a car,
for example,

1777
01:26:58,578 --> 01:27:00,613
you would be responsible
for your actions.

1778
01:27:00,647 --> 01:27:03,850
But if you wrecked a car
thinking it was a submarine,

1779
01:27:03,883 --> 01:27:05,618
you wouldn't.

1780
01:27:05,652 --> 01:27:07,285
So to be clear,

1781
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:10,222
a person can have control
over their actions

1782
01:27:10,255 --> 01:27:12,558
within the delusion,
but they would not be

1783
01:27:12,592 --> 01:27:15,260
legally responsible for those
actions, correct?

1784
01:27:15,293 --> 01:27:17,530
- Correct.
- Thank you.

1785
01:27:18,564 --> 01:27:20,566
Just one last question.

1786
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,469
When you provide expert
testimony for the prosecution,

1787
01:27:23,503 --> 01:27:25,672
are you
paid for your expertise?

1788
01:27:25,705 --> 01:27:26,506
Yes.

1789
01:27:27,339 --> 01:27:29,776
He's your client, not me,
correct?

1790
01:27:30,476 --> 01:27:32,712
- Correct.
- Thank you.

1791
01:27:36,683 --> 01:27:38,651
Mr. Bradley,
would you like to cross?

1792
01:27:38,685 --> 01:27:40,586
Yes, Your Honor.

1793
01:27:42,689 --> 01:27:45,458
Let's get a few things
straight.

1794
01:27:45,491 --> 01:27:47,894
You had a couple of sessions
with the defendant to determine

1795
01:27:47,927 --> 01:27:49,896
his competence to stand trial;
is that correct?

1796
01:27:49,929 --> 01:27:51,597
Yes.

1797
01:27:51,631 --> 01:27:53,398
[Bradley]
But that's not all, was it?

1798
01:27:53,433 --> 01:27:55,535
No, I was determining
whether or not he had

1799
01:27:55,568 --> 01:27:57,369
a valid plea of insanity.

1800
01:27:57,402 --> 01:27:58,971
Did he?

1801
01:27:59,005 --> 01:28:00,940
No. I didn't think so
at the time.

1802
01:28:00,973 --> 01:28:02,875
But based
on these wild stories,

1803
01:28:02,909 --> 01:28:04,777
you think he
might be delusional?

1804
01:28:06,446 --> 01:28:07,947
It's possible.

1805
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:10,516
[Bradley] But not to
your knowledge of fact?

1806
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:12,284
No.

1807
01:28:12,317 --> 01:28:15,387
Why didn't you notice
these delusional tendencies

1808
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,490
during your sessions?

1809
01:28:17,523 --> 01:28:19,291
It didn't come up.

1810
01:28:19,324 --> 01:28:22,394
- It didn't come up?
- No.

1811
01:28:22,427 --> 01:28:24,296
Did you talk about
the assassination?

1812
01:28:24,329 --> 01:28:25,832
Yes.

1813
01:28:25,865 --> 01:28:28,000
And he didn't happen
to mention any of that stuff

1814
01:28:28,034 --> 01:28:29,702
about the future?

1815
01:28:29,736 --> 01:28:31,637
Don't you find that odd?

1816
01:28:31,671 --> 01:28:33,473
Objection. Opinion, Your Honor.

1817
01:28:33,506 --> 01:28:36,976
I'm asking her as an
expert for her expert opinion.

1818
01:28:37,009 --> 01:28:38,578
Overruled.

1819
01:28:39,445 --> 01:28:42,380
- Don't you find that odd?
- Yes.

1820
01:28:42,414 --> 01:28:44,684
That was nothing like
the performance

1821
01:28:44,717 --> 01:28:46,452
that he gave in here, was it?

1822
01:28:46,486 --> 01:28:47,653
I didn't see it.

1823
01:28:47,687 --> 01:28:49,655
- But you read it?
- Yes.

1824
01:28:49,689 --> 01:28:51,858
And did it come across
like anything

1825
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:54,392
you experienced in your
sessions?

1826
01:28:54,426 --> 01:28:56,796
No. It didn't.

1827
01:28:56,829 --> 01:28:59,732
He was quiet, composed.

1828
01:29:01,033 --> 01:29:03,970
If a person is delusional,

1829
01:29:04,003 --> 01:29:07,707
are they able to choose
when to be delusional?

1830
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:10,743
- No, not typically.
- Not typically?

1831
01:29:10,777 --> 01:29:12,879
I'm not aware of
any cases like that.

1832
01:29:12,912 --> 01:29:15,581
- So no?
- Correct.

1833
01:29:16,015 --> 01:29:17,650
Thank you.

1834
01:29:17,683 --> 01:29:19,284
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1835
01:29:20,853 --> 01:29:22,789
- Redirect Your Honor.
- [Judge] Go ahead.

1836
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:27,894
Are you 100% certain

1837
01:29:27,927 --> 01:29:30,930
it's not possible to choose
when to be delusional?

1838
01:29:30,963 --> 01:29:32,732
Well, anything is possible.

1839
01:29:32,765 --> 01:29:34,801
I'm just not aware of
it ever being done.

1840
01:29:35,768 --> 01:29:37,436
Are you a mind reader?

1841
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:38,704
Excuse me.

1842
01:29:38,738 --> 01:29:40,606
[Jason] Are you a mind reader?

1843
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,475
Can you tell what people are
thinking about or believe?

1844
01:29:42,508 --> 01:29:43,943
No.

1845
01:29:43,976 --> 01:29:46,712
So just because my client
didn't talk to you

1846
01:29:46,746 --> 01:29:48,447
about where he thinks
he's from,

1847
01:29:48,481 --> 01:29:50,082
doesn't mean
he doesn't believe it.

1848
01:29:50,116 --> 01:29:51,918
He could still
be delusional, correct?

1849
01:29:52,585 --> 01:29:54,352
- Correct.
- Thank you.

1850
01:29:55,087 --> 01:29:56,789
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1851
01:29:56,823 --> 01:29:58,491
The defense rest our case.

1852
01:29:59,091 --> 01:30:01,527
We'll take a short recess
and hear closing arguments.

1853
01:30:01,894 --> 01:30:04,096
[gavel smashing]

1854
01:30:05,731 --> 01:30:09,735
[brooding pensive music]

1855
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:17,409
Mr. Bradley,

1856
01:30:17,443 --> 01:30:18,811
are you ready to present
your closing arguments?

1857
01:30:18,845 --> 01:30:20,479
Yes, Your Honor.

1858
01:30:22,548 --> 01:30:26,586
I want to thank you for your
patience during this trial.

1859
01:30:26,619 --> 01:30:30,456
I have to admit I had a
hard time keeping track of all

1860
01:30:30,489 --> 01:30:33,025
the contortions that
the defense went through.

1861
01:30:33,059 --> 01:30:35,528
I think they started with
a plea of not guilty

1862
01:30:35,561 --> 01:30:40,132
by reason of insanity to, well,
let's see, self-defense.

1863
01:30:40,166 --> 01:30:42,935
And then let
the self-defense explanation

1864
01:30:42,969 --> 01:30:45,705
explain how the
defendant is delusional.

1865
01:30:47,106 --> 01:30:50,643
It's quite a show they put on,
but that's all that it was.

1866
01:30:50,676 --> 01:30:54,981
So don't be fooled
by their theatrics.

1867
01:30:55,014 --> 01:30:58,918
All we know for sure is
that the defendant, John Doe,

1868
01:30:59,785 --> 01:31:02,088
well, he can tell a good story,

1869
01:31:02,121 --> 01:31:04,891
and he can shoot the CheyTac
M200 sniper rifle

1870
01:31:04,924 --> 01:31:08,094
from 1.2 miles
and blow the head

1871
01:31:08,127 --> 01:31:10,663
off the President
of the United States.

1872
01:31:10,696 --> 01:31:13,900
We not only proved it,
he admitted it.

1873
01:31:15,468 --> 01:31:19,105
He's admitted to planning
the whole thing out in advance

1874
01:31:19,138 --> 01:31:21,741
with intent
to kill the President.

1875
01:31:21,774 --> 01:31:24,844
And really, that's all we need.

1876
01:31:24,877 --> 01:31:28,014
If there's intent, there
can be no insanity defense.

1877
01:31:28,047 --> 01:31:30,182
One can't claim that
they weren't in control

1878
01:31:30,216 --> 01:31:31,884
of their actions
or they didn't know

1879
01:31:31,918 --> 01:31:34,553
what they were doing
if in fact, they did.

1880
01:31:35,988 --> 01:31:40,493
The laws have always held
that if you plan something out,

1881
01:31:40,526 --> 01:31:44,163
if you intend to commit
a crime and then commit one,

1882
01:31:44,196 --> 01:31:46,966
you were
in control of your actions.

1883
01:31:46,999 --> 01:31:50,803
And Mr. Doe has admitted yes,
he did indeed intend

1884
01:31:50,836 --> 01:31:52,038
to kill the President.

1885
01:31:53,839 --> 01:31:56,475
He has admitted to
killing the President.

1886
01:31:56,509 --> 01:31:58,611
He's admitted to planning
the assassination,

1887
01:31:58,644 --> 01:32:00,146
and he has admitted
to carrying it out.

1888
01:32:00,179 --> 01:32:02,181
So there you have it.

1889
01:32:03,015 --> 01:32:05,584
Wait, one more thing.

1890
01:32:06,786 --> 01:32:09,689
He has absolutely
no remorse

1891
01:32:09,722 --> 01:32:11,991
and would probably do it again
if given the chance.

1892
01:32:13,225 --> 01:32:16,629
That's why we've charged him
with first-degree murder

1893
01:32:16,662 --> 01:32:19,198
and why we are seeking
the death penalty

1894
01:32:19,231 --> 01:32:21,100
in sentencing because
there's no other choice.

1895
01:32:22,201 --> 01:32:24,537
Opposing counsel can
trot out as many far-fetched

1896
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:26,639
stories as they want,
but that won't change

1897
01:32:26,672 --> 01:32:29,742
the fact that there is
only one choice in this trial.

1898
01:32:29,775 --> 01:32:35,748
And that choice is guilty
beyond any reasonable doubt.

1899
01:32:38,918 --> 01:32:39,986
Thank you.

1900
01:32:44,156 --> 01:32:45,658
[Judge] Thank you, Mr. Bradley.

1901
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:48,494
Mr. Johnson.

1902
01:33:01,307 --> 01:33:03,743
I have to say Mr. Bradley
makes a valid point,

1903
01:33:05,277 --> 01:33:08,014
except for one small detail,

1904
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,850
being delusional.

1905
01:33:11,717 --> 01:33:15,121
In this case, believing
you're somebody you're not,

1906
01:33:15,154 --> 01:33:17,723
is grounds
for an insanity plea.

1907
01:33:18,758 --> 01:33:23,095
It means that you,
whoever you really are,

1908
01:33:23,129 --> 01:33:25,331
have no
control over your actions,

1909
01:33:25,364 --> 01:33:28,701
those actions are in
the hands of someone else.

1910
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:30,770
You don't have to take
my word on it,

1911
01:33:30,803 --> 01:33:32,238
you can take the word

1912
01:33:32,271 --> 01:33:34,673
of the prosecution's own
expert witness.

1913
01:33:34,707 --> 01:33:37,743
Unfortunately, my client has
not been officially diagnosed

1914
01:33:37,777 --> 01:33:42,148
as delusional, so you'll
have to be the judge of that.

1915
01:33:43,249 --> 01:33:45,985
Now, you've seen all
the courtroom drama shows

1916
01:33:46,018 --> 01:33:48,154
on TV where no one wants
to put their defendant

1917
01:33:48,187 --> 01:33:52,024
on the witness stand, there
are abundant reasons for that.

1918
01:33:52,058 --> 01:33:54,326
Mostly, so skilled prosecutors

1919
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,729
like Mr. Bradley,
can't interrogate them.

1920
01:33:57,997 --> 01:34:00,633
And yet in our case, I realized
that was our best defense.

1921
01:34:01,167 --> 01:34:03,669
I realized that if you
could see and hear my client

1922
01:34:03,702 --> 01:34:07,740
talk about his life,
he was his own best evidence.

1923
01:34:07,773 --> 01:34:10,009
Unless perhaps you
believe in time travel

1924
01:34:10,042 --> 01:34:12,711
and dystopian worlds.

1925
01:34:12,745 --> 01:34:15,948
I wanted you to experience
his... his confidence,

1926
01:34:16,248 --> 01:34:18,784
his unwavering focus
on his mission,

1927
01:34:18,818 --> 01:34:21,854
I wanted you to meet a man
who truly believes

1928
01:34:21,887 --> 01:34:24,390
he is from the future,
40 years from now.

1929
01:34:24,423 --> 01:34:28,661
A man who truly believes he is
on a mission to save the world,

1930
01:34:28,694 --> 01:34:30,262
and that mission requires him

1931
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:33,766
to assassinate the President
of the United States,

1932
01:34:33,799 --> 01:34:36,168
even if it costs him
his own life.

1933
01:34:38,003 --> 01:34:39,305
What's critical,

1934
01:34:40,806 --> 01:34:42,942
is you don't even have to
believe him,

1935
01:34:43,776 --> 01:34:45,978
just believed that he believes.

1936
01:34:47,847 --> 01:34:50,983
Now if you believe in time
travel and dystopian worlds,

1937
01:34:51,884 --> 01:34:54,286
you might think of
my client as a hero,

1938
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:58,791
as someone willing to sacrifice
their life to save your future.

1939
01:34:58,824 --> 01:35:02,328
In that case, my client's claim
of self-defense

1940
01:35:02,361 --> 01:35:04,697
is perfectly plausible.

1941
01:35:07,066 --> 01:35:09,335
But most likely you're like me,

1942
01:35:09,368 --> 01:35:11,971
and believe that time travel

1943
01:35:12,004 --> 01:35:13,906
and dystopian worlds
are best left

1944
01:35:13,939 --> 01:35:16,308
to the writers of movies,
and novels, and plays.

1945
01:35:18,310 --> 01:35:20,279
In that case,

1946
01:35:21,714 --> 01:35:25,084
you don't need a psychiatrist
to give you a diagnosis.

1947
01:35:25,117 --> 01:35:28,220
You saw it,
and heard it, firsthand,

1948
01:35:28,254 --> 01:35:31,023
you met Gordon Nicholson,

1949
01:35:31,056 --> 01:35:33,460
time traveler
and savior of worlds,

1950
01:35:33,493 --> 01:35:36,795
and according to the law,
you have only one choice,

1951
01:35:37,497 --> 01:35:41,033
and that's a verdict of not
guilty by reason of insanity.

1952
01:35:41,834 --> 01:35:44,236
And if there's one iota
of a chance you're not sure,

1953
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:46,305
if you can't decide
whether that man over there

1954
01:35:46,338 --> 01:35:50,242
is a fraud or a hero,
then you can't believe that

1955
01:35:50,276 --> 01:35:52,845
he is guilty beyond
any reasonable doubt.

1956
01:35:52,878 --> 01:35:55,114
So in either instance,

1957
01:35:55,147 --> 01:35:57,850
there's only one verdict
that makes sense.

1958
01:35:57,883 --> 01:36:01,754
There's only one verdict you
can return to this court with,

1959
01:36:02,922 --> 01:36:05,257
and that verdict is this...

1960
01:36:05,291 --> 01:36:09,762
My client is not guilty
by reason of insanity.

1961
01:36:12,398 --> 01:36:13,832
Thank you.

1962
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,168
Thank you.

1963
01:36:16,202 --> 01:36:18,204
I'd like to remind the jury
that they've been sequestered

1964
01:36:18,237 --> 01:36:20,739
for a reason and to
remember the rules.

1965
01:36:20,773 --> 01:36:24,009
No media of any kind,
no outside conversations.

1966
01:36:24,043 --> 01:36:25,945
You are charged with
determining whether

1967
01:36:25,978 --> 01:36:28,080
the defendant is guilty
of murdering the president.

1968
01:36:28,113 --> 01:36:30,282
There will be an earthquake
in Bangkok next week.

1969
01:36:30,316 --> 01:36:33,252
You can save them.
Over 8,000 people will die.

1970
01:36:33,285 --> 01:36:35,020
Get the defendant out of here.

1971
01:36:35,054 --> 01:36:36,121
I am not delusional.

1972
01:36:36,155 --> 01:36:38,090
I am from the future.

1973
01:36:38,123 --> 01:36:39,892
Gag him.

1974
01:36:45,998 --> 01:36:49,134
Mr. Johnson, if I discover
you put him up to that,

1975
01:36:49,168 --> 01:36:51,003
not only will
I hold you in contempt,

1976
01:36:51,036 --> 01:36:52,905
I will see to it that
you are disbarred.

1977
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:57,444
And jurors, you will disregard
the defendant's last statement.

1978
01:36:57,477 --> 01:36:59,945
That did not just
happen in my courtroom.

1979
01:36:59,979 --> 01:37:01,548
You will judge this
case based on the evidence

1980
01:37:01,581 --> 01:37:03,916
that's been provided.

1981
01:37:03,949 --> 01:37:05,784
You are charged with
determining whether

1982
01:37:05,818 --> 01:37:07,286
the defendant is guilty
of murdering the president,

1983
01:37:07,319 --> 01:37:09,154
or not guilty by reason
of insanity

1984
01:37:09,188 --> 01:37:11,190
based on the legal
guidelines set before you.

1985
01:37:11,223 --> 01:37:13,392
Send any
questions to my bailiff.

1986
01:37:13,425 --> 01:37:15,227
We're done for the day.

1987
01:37:15,261 --> 01:37:17,329
[gavel smashing]

1988
01:37:17,363 --> 01:37:19,432
[sad melancholic music]

1989
01:38:01,206 --> 01:38:03,108
[sighing]

1990
01:38:16,221 --> 01:38:17,890
You okay?

1991
01:38:20,025 --> 01:38:21,461
Yes.

1992
01:38:24,029 --> 01:38:27,099
That was uh,
quite a performance,

1993
01:38:27,132 --> 01:38:30,603
that earthquake in Bangkok,
brilliant.

1994
01:38:43,349 --> 01:38:44,983
What's wrong?

1995
01:38:47,019 --> 01:38:48,455
It doesn't matter.

1996
01:38:48,488 --> 01:38:50,189
It may have saved your life.

1997
01:38:50,222 --> 01:38:51,957
No, it doesn't matter.

1998
01:38:53,092 --> 01:38:55,227
What they come back with.
I did it.

1999
01:38:58,631 --> 01:39:00,600
It's just now sinking in.

2000
01:39:03,402 --> 01:39:05,638
[exhaling deeply]

2001
01:39:05,672 --> 01:39:10,309
I never thought I was born
to save the world.

2002
01:39:12,645 --> 01:39:14,447
But I'm here.

2003
01:39:17,282 --> 01:39:18,984
Getting here wasn't easy.

2004
01:39:19,017 --> 01:39:21,855
None of it was easy,
people died helping me.

2005
01:39:23,155 --> 01:39:26,058
And I did it.

2006
01:39:29,027 --> 01:39:32,131
I... I just hope
it was worth it.

2007
01:39:35,167 --> 01:39:39,405
You don't have to say
that anymore, it's over.

2008
01:39:41,574 --> 01:39:45,077
The jury sent a list
of questions to the judge,

2009
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:47,179
and one of the questions,
the big one,

2010
01:39:47,212 --> 01:39:49,248
was if they could postpone
their deliberations

2011
01:39:49,281 --> 01:39:51,316
until next week because
of your prediction.

2012
01:39:53,152 --> 01:39:55,120
The judge would never
go along with it,

2013
01:39:55,154 --> 01:39:57,055
but it was
enough to rattle Bradley.

2014
01:39:57,089 --> 01:39:59,291
He offered to take the
death penalty off the table.

2015
01:40:00,092 --> 01:40:03,463
He'll accept the insanity plea
if you accept life in prison.

2016
01:40:06,566 --> 01:40:08,200
I didn't expect to live.

2017
01:40:09,168 --> 01:40:10,202
Now you can.

2018
01:40:13,105 --> 01:40:16,476
What if we let the jury decide,
what are my chances?

2019
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:22,314
Best case is a hung jury,
then a retrial.

2020
01:40:22,347 --> 01:40:24,049
By that time they'll
know there wasn't

2021
01:40:24,082 --> 01:40:26,318
an earthquake in Bangkok.

2022
01:40:26,351 --> 01:40:29,021
Bottom line is,
you assassinated

2023
01:40:29,054 --> 01:40:31,624
the President of
the United States.

2024
01:40:31,658 --> 01:40:33,726
You'll never be out
walking the streets again,

2025
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,595
that's not
how the system works.

2026
01:40:35,628 --> 01:40:38,163
If you get out of this
thing still breathing,

2027
01:40:38,197 --> 01:40:40,433
that's the best
that's going to happen.

2028
01:40:42,435 --> 01:40:45,103
I'll be able to see
if it was worth it.

2029
01:40:45,137 --> 01:40:46,405
That too.

2030
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:50,510
Okay.

2031
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:54,980
Do it.

2032
01:40:57,316 --> 01:40:58,451
Thank you.

2033
01:40:59,819 --> 01:41:01,186
Okay.

2034
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:05,558
And, uh, just for the record,

2035
01:41:07,594 --> 01:41:09,662
I hated the fucking asshole
for what he was doing

2036
01:41:09,696 --> 01:41:11,531
to this country
and the rest of the world.

2037
01:41:11,564 --> 01:41:14,634
I don't approve
of what you did,

2038
01:41:14,667 --> 01:41:18,403
but I'm sure glad you did it,
and I'm not alone,

2039
01:41:18,438 --> 01:41:21,139
so thank you.

2040
01:41:22,475 --> 01:41:24,309
Thank you for your service.

2041
01:41:35,822 --> 01:41:40,225
[keys clanging]

2042
01:41:40,259 --> 01:41:45,030
[door buzzing,
clanging, and slamming]

2043
01:41:45,532 --> 01:41:46,398
Hey Jason,

2044
01:41:48,735 --> 01:41:52,237
you know what I said about
that earthquake in Bangkok?

2045
01:41:59,579 --> 01:42:01,280
Let's wait and see.

2046
01:42:02,849 --> 01:42:05,050
