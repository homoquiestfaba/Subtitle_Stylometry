00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:28,307
WCAU AM Newstime in the city
of Brotherly Love is three PM.

2
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,576
ln the news this hour,
President Nixon's re-election campaign

3
00:00:31,707 --> 00:00:34,746
was interrupted today
by Vietnam protestors,

4
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:37,816
despite 25,000 American casualties,

5
00:00:37,947 --> 00:00:41,153
the President reiterated his plan
to stay the course.

6
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:44,422
Thousands of women rallied
in Times Square this afternoon

7
00:00:44,553 --> 00:00:47,392
to demand equal pay for equal jobs.

8
00:00:47,523 --> 00:00:50,060
Feminist leaders took to
the podium to voice,

9
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:55,368
we should be training to be a doctor,
not training to mary a doctor.

10
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:09,914
l wish l could say that life
was always this simple.

11
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,052
But, for me that really
came down to mo choices.

12
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:18,591
Could l deal with rejection
and temporay pain, or,

13
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:21,057
or should l sumer a life
filled with regret

14
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:23,227
because l was afraid to take the risk?

15
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,538
At the time l only knew
a few things about the college.

16
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:38,344
lt was all girls,
their basketball team wasn't vey good.

17
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:47,320
And, the school was
founded and run by the Nuns.

18
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:51,855
l had no coaching experience,

19
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:55,761
so l was somewhat surprised
when they responded to my resume.

20
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:57,560
But, on the sumace,

21
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:00,364
it seemed like
the pemect opportunih for a woman

22
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:03,368
who wasn't ready to
assume her role in socieh.

23
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:25,323
Hi, l'm May-Margaret O'Malley,
and welcome to Immaculata College.

24
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:26,255
How may l help you?

25
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:27,790
Ah, Mother St. John's office?

26
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:30,295
Room mo menh, take the staircase
to the second floor...

27
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:31,227
...lt's menh eight steps...

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,729
Proceed through
mo walnut oak doors.

29
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,632
And all even rooms on your left.

30
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:35,864
Thank you.

31
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:37,334
No, thank you.

32
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:40,205
Oh, Rally for O'Malley.

33
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:57,721
Catherine Rush?

34
00:02:57,853 --> 00:02:59,991
Yes. Thank you.

35
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:03,762
Are you named after
St. Catherine of Sienna,

36
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:06,131
or st. Catherine of Alexandria?

37
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,067
ls there ah...
St. Catherine of Atlantic Cih?

38
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,871
Well, if there is,
l hope she didn't sumer the same fate

39
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,940
as St. Catherine of Alexandria.

40
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,373
She was beheaded.

41
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:20,043
Ah, here's my ah...

42
00:03:20,177 --> 00:03:23,116
lt's all right, l have one here.
l see you're married?

43
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:25,549
Yes, just a few months now.

44
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:30,089
Physical Educational degree
Westchester State College.

45
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:31,187
Did you play there?

46
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:32,255
Two years.

47
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,825
What do you know about coaching?

48
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:38,597
Well, l know for the first time,
it'll be five on five,

49
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:43,303
full court with unlimited dribbling,
so it's obviously not our Mother's game.

50
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,335
lt will be similar to the men's game.

51
00:03:45,802 --> 00:03:50,010
Yes, similar to the men's rules,
but the, the game will be dimerent.

52
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:51,174
How so?

53
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:54,779
Oh, we'll actually play like a team.

54
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:59,285
And ah, ah, thim second shot clock
means better conditioned athletes.

55
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:04,457
Are you suggesting that
our girls will become athletes?

56
00:04:04,587 --> 00:04:06,123
lf they want to win, yes.

57
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:09,194
l'll be satisfied
if you just use these activities

58
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:11,797
to suppress their hormones.

59
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:14,565
Huh, l'll ty to add
that to the playbook.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,041
Well... seeing that no one else
has applied for the position,

61
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:22,639
l'm prepared to offer you

62
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:25,343
four hundred and fim dollars
for the season.

63
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:28,714
That'll be just fine.
Do l get an assistant?

64
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:31,951
No, only if they volunteer.

65
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:37,691
Ah, this is our last ball.
Please ah, don't lose it.

66
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:41,259
Thank you.
Can l ah, have a key to the gym?

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,826
Oh, you won't need one.

68
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:44,427
Great.

69
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:46,998
The gym burned down
three months ago.

70
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:49,901
Here's the student's schedule.

71
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:51,300
Now, if you'll excuse me,

72
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:54,205
l must attend to
the needs of our Sisters.

73
00:04:54,638 --> 00:04:57,175
Practice is scheduled to
begin in three days.

74
00:04:57,306 --> 00:04:58,207
Ah, where?

75
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,110
l don't know, you're the coach.

76
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:03,447
Mrs. Rush...

77
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:07,620
l hope you're a better coach
than you are a negotiator.

78
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,719
Why is that?

79
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:11,289
l was prepared to offer five hundred.

80
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:15,429
That's okay,
cause l was willing to coach for free.

81
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:40,852
Congratulations.

82
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:43,520
Are you mad?

83
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:44,921
Why would l be mad?

84
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:48,660
You got that same look
when l beat you in tennis.

85
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:52,062
When do you start?

86
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:55,966
Tomorrow.

87
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,070
Like l said Cathy,
why would l be mad?

88
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:01,205
Come on Eddy, it's just a little
something to keep me busy.

89
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,810
Just like ah...
tennis was a little something to ah...

90
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,075
what, keep in shape?

91
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,680
l know how bad you wanted to
go on this vacation, honey, and l do...

92
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:09,915
lt's not about that, Cathy,
we both agreed to...

93
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:11,916
Will you...
will you just hear me out?

94
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:15,887
l, l want to have a family
with you...

95
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,757
more than anything
in the whole world.

96
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:21,227
But, if l don't ty this just once,

97
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:23,995
l'll always wonder,
what if, you know?

98
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:30,004
You know how much
l wanted this. Right?

99
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:36,777
Let not yours be the output
the dawning with radiant...

100
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:39,745
decoration of gold, and wearing...

101
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:44,551
but let it be the hidden person
of the heart.

102
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:56,193
Thank you.

103
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:06,174
And since you are the joint heirs of
the grace of life,

104
00:07:06,337 --> 00:07:08,741
finally, all of you...

105
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,444
have unih of spirits...

106
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:14,846
Pass that to her.
That girl over there.

107
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:17,917
...the sympathy,
Iove of the brethren,

108
00:07:18,048 --> 00:07:21,287
a tender heart and a humble mind,

109
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:27,164
do not return evil for evil,
or reviling for reviling.

110
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:31,699
For on the contray, bless, bless...

111
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:34,266
Yeah, right there. Right

112
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,210
...for this you have been called,
that you may obtain a blessing.

113
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:46,112
This is the word of the Lord.

114
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:48,246
Amen.

115
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:55,685
Bonjour.

116
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:58,992
Hey, l thought you were home
shopping for engagement rings?

117
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:00,758
Nah, he wants to wait till graduation.

118
00:08:01,091 --> 00:08:04,664
He gave me his letter jacket,
as a pre-engagement ring.

119
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:09,403
Ah, vey nice Lizanne.
We're going out for team, right?

120
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:15,009
Why, so we can continue to
get crushed by all the bigger schools?

121
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:19,948
Look, they didn't recruit me either.
You need to let it go.

122
00:08:20,077 --> 00:08:22,748
You know what,
l think l'm ready to get a job.

123
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,852
Yeah. Right. Trishy.

124
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:27,953
ln a week,
you'll be looking for an open gym.

125
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:31,724
You in? We're in, right?

126
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:41,333
Yeah, l'll think about it.

127
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:50,175
We're also requesting, once again,

128
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:54,515
that the heating system be
replaced in the Freshman dormitoy.

129
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:56,682
So, where do l find these numbers?

130
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,082
Page five.

131
00:08:58,516 --> 00:09:00,253
What about the alumni support?

132
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:02,989
They're not banging
the buckets like they used to.

133
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:05,022
Yes?

134
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:07,293
Ah, Mother Superior, it's Cathy Rush.

135
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:08,693
l'm in a meeting.

136
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:10,595
l, l'll just wait out here.

137
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:12,563
Oh, excuse me.

138
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:15,967
What is it?

139
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,903
lt's bitterly cold outside,
Reverend Mother

140
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:19,738
and l can't find an indoor court.

141
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,305
Excuse me.

142
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,774
Sory.

143
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:31,049
The old activih center.

144
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:33,151
Oh, thank you so much,
and all of you, of course.

145
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:34,920
Thank you for this opportunih, l...

146
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,688
Please. Please.

147
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:42,628
l wonder if you'd
all excuse me for a minute,

148
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,066
l, l'd like a private word
with Monsignor.

149
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:43,326
Ah, you can't depend on the trustees
for continued financial support.

150
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:46,526
Now the board will be
meeting in three months...

151
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,062
so, consider yourself warned.

152
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:52,497
Mother of God.

153
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,967
Don't take this personally.

154
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:58,305
This is...
the business side of our church.

155
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:02,410
But Tom, why can't we use
the insurance money from the gym?

156
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,948
Unfortunately, it will take
an act of God to save this school.

157
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:12,119
Well, that's exactly
what l've been praying for.

158
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:55,127
Come in.

159
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:00,533
Yes?

160
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,237
Reverend Mother
may l speak with yo'u?

161
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:05,836
Sit down.

162
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:15,182
How may l be of assistance, Sister?

163
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,021
l'm not sure l can do this anymore.

164
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:26,195
Admissions is always dimicult,
especially in these changing times.

165
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:30,296
That's not what l meant.

166
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:36,738
l'm sory, but,
l'm requesting some time off.

167
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:40,872
l'm not surprised.

168
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:43,576
Did you ever struggle
with your calling?

169
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:52,355
lf we didn't have to struggle,
we could never harvest the gloy.

170
00:12:57,055 --> 00:13:03,333
l'm sory Mother Superior,
l thought my service would be dimerent.

171
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:07,034
l'll be glad to
reassign you to Chapel,

172
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:10,839
that should give you plenh
of time to ask for guidance.

173
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:16,709
Trish Sharkey.

174
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:17,876
Here.

175
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,277
Lizanne Caufield.

176
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,647
lcei, it's French for here.

177
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:26,957
Merci, it's French for be
a team player. Ah, what is it?

178
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:29,355
l think l'm allergic to dust.

179
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:33,896
You will make a wondemul husband.
Gail Moore.

180
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:35,160
Here.

181
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,262
Colleen McCann.

182
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,765
Here.

183
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:40,967
Was that a here, Miss McCann?

184
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:42,433
Yes.

185
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:49,312
Short, tall, fast or slow,
it's our voice that makes us one.

186
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,475
Understood?

187
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:52,277
Yes.

188
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:54,480
Jen Galidino.

189
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:55,513
Here.

190
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:58,084
Who here likes to win?

191
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:03,190
That is the only reason
you should be here.

192
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:06,894
Unless, of course, you're tying to
avoid household chores.

193
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:10,197
lf that's the case, we've already
got mo things in common.

194
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:14,502
Jen, you know why teams win?

195
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,201
Talent?

196
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:19,472
lf basketball were only about talent,
it would be played one on one.

197
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:22,575
You like these girls, Jen?

198
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:26,277
Yeah, l guess.

199
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:33,558
Okay. Who here thinks that
Jen's lipstick is a good color for her?

200
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:38,458
Come on, anybody? Look at her.

201
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:43,299
Cute girl, olive skin,
beautiful smile...

202
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:45,799
and street corner lipstick.

203
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,001
Colleen, care to comment?

204
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:57,146
Trust. Trust is why teams win.

205
00:14:57,743 --> 00:15:01,851
And, if you can't trust your teammate,
to tell you your lipstick is wrong,

206
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,019
you can't trust your teammate's call
at a back door screen.

207
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:11,394
So, l will ask again...
who here thinks it's a bad color?

208
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,806
Easy to fix. Watch each other's backs.
That's all l'm saying.

209
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:44,958
Who here knows how to mim?

210
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:48,127
Great, the wooden pool is open.

211
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:50,631
lf you want it, fight for it.

212
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:58,205
And, if you're afraid to
get your hair wet,

213
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,074
you can always wear one of these.

214
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,444
This is so unladylike.

215
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:07,380
You should quit, too.

216
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:11,517
Next.

217
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:14,288
My dear Lord almighh.

218
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:19,895
Running projections,
analyzing numbers,

219
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,529
and finding applications.

220
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:28,170
l failed to find
the spiritual nourishment required

221
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:34,378
to enter my fifth year,
and take my final vows.

222
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:38,011
So, l implore your divine guidance,

223
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,582
to have mercy on me
in this dimicult time,

224
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:44,318
and l ask that you send me ah...

225
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:52,393
...l implore your divine...

226
00:16:56,428 --> 00:17:03,341
to send me a sign, any sign as
l will be listening for your voice.

227
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,529
Bring it in, good job,
give yourselves a hand.

228
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:08,938
l want each of you to
take one of these.

229
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,907
Here you go, and pass them around.

230
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:18,246
Hold the top mo corners bemeen
your index finger and your thumb.

231
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,724
Uh huh. Now,
l want you to close your eyes.

232
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:30,257
Close your eyes, good.

233
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:34,595
Now, l want you to
envision evemhing

234
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:38,166
you know about the game
of basketball.

235
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:46,880
Defense, screens, jumpshots,
Iayouts, keep thinking.

236
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:52,481
Evemhing you have ever done
on a basketball court...

237
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:56,886
rebounds, bounce pass...
think some more.

238
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:04,527
Now, l want you to
take all that knowledge

239
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:12,705
and mentally transfer that knowledge
onto these delicate pieces of paper.

240
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:17,840
Make sure you leave nothing behind.

241
00:19:19,204 --> 00:19:22,578
And take that paper,
hold it close to your heart...

242
00:19:25,712 --> 00:19:30,588
embrace that knowledge,
you can open your eyes.

243
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:33,553
Excellent.

244
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,590
Place them gently in the basket.

245
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:39,860
There you go, Gail.

246
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:55,949
Now, what we must do is
take evemhing you know and...

247
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:03,420
get rid of it. l'll see you here
tomorrow at seven am.

248
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:04,216
What?

249
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,654
Get used to it,
and then again, four pm.

250
00:20:06,786 --> 00:20:07,487
That's mice?

251
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,557
Bright and early. Good night, girls.

252
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:10,757
Two times?

253
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:12,693
Where did you play?

254
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:14,596
West Catholic.

255
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:16,531
lt's a nice pass.

256
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:34,549
Ma, where are Frankie's boots?

257
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:36,785
By the front door. They're wet.

258
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,689
Just need some plastic bags.

259
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:51,600
Oh, thanks Ma.

260
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:01,209
And, tell Frankie
l'll need a ride home.

261
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:02,209
Will do.

262
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:04,445
Got to go.

263
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:07,347
Love yah.

264
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:09,349
Love you, too.

265
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:48,556
Before evey practice,

266
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:50,691
l'd wait outside
that gym and hope

267
00:21:50,823 --> 00:21:54,397
that five girls would be
willing to race a new world.

268
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:01,237
We started with fifteen girls who
had fifteen dimerent stories,

269
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:03,738
and it didn't take long to hear them.

270
00:22:03,937 --> 00:22:06,274
Jen was our fun-loving Nurse
in training.

271
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:10,179
She was looking for an excuse
to get out of the house.

272
00:22:12,512 --> 00:22:15,986
Lizanne, a solid role player
who could be a star

273
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:18,520
if she wasn't
so busy planning her engagement.

274
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:23,192
And, Trish, a big time player
who got overlooked,

275
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:24,259
so all she could think about was

276
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,162
where she wasn't
and what she didn't have.

277
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,165
And so, we began.

278
00:22:45,312 --> 00:22:46,915
Plaid sashes, huh?

279
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:50,652
So, l heard you were the all time
Ieading scorer at Oakcrest High.

280
00:22:52,252 --> 00:22:57,562
God, yeah l was.
Too bad l never liked pom-poms.

281
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:00,194
l don't get it.

282
00:23:01,394 --> 00:23:04,099
Senior year they dropped
Girls Varsih Basketball.

283
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:07,870
They asked us to be
Cheerleaders instead.

284
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:09,303
That's not right.

285
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:11,305
That's what l thought, too.

286
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:14,809
Thanks for the new rim.

287
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:19,715
We are here to serve.

288
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:22,718
l can't wear this.

289
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,220
Swing your partners
round and round.

290
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:26,554
lt's not that bad.

291
00:23:26,687 --> 00:23:28,456
That's because you're already married.

292
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:30,457
Who are these inspected by,
Adam and Eve?

293
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,863
For now.
This is all we have, so buck up.

294
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:39,869
All right. Stretch it out, come on.

295
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:51,813
You're still here.

296
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,448
Bend your knees.

297
00:23:56,784 --> 00:24:00,023
The first thing you'll learn,
how to defend.

298
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:02,189
lf you can defend,
it shows me you care,

299
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,294
and if you care, we can play as one.

300
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:07,394
Now, get low.

301
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:09,664
Hands out, palms up.

302
00:24:10,864 --> 00:24:12,199
Slide left.

303
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:16,871
Lower.

304
00:24:17,137 --> 00:24:19,609
Don't cheat me, don't cheat yourself.

305
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,142
Come on back this way.

306
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,010
Okay good. Keep going.

307
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,647
There you go.

308
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,382
Good job, Trish.

309
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:32,623
First thing evey young girl
should learn,

310
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:34,590
proper way to clean a floor.

311
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:38,594
So, ladies.

312
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:39,527
Make it shine.

313
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,099
Slide, slide. Left.

314
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,470
For the next six months,
you need to break up with your ego,

315
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:47,768
if you can't do that,

316
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:49,638
there are plenh of
playground courts out there

317
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,239
that'll accommodate you.

318
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:54,877
Anyone else want to quit,
now would be a good time.

319
00:24:55,142 --> 00:24:59,818
Right, slide, slide.
Good Trish. Slide.

320
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,783
Representing this school
is a privilege.

321
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:04,854
Mimi, down.
We will learn to defend it.

322
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,891
She already has a husband,
why would she want to work?

323
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:09,424
We know who she's married to,
right?

324
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:11,225
Ed Rush, the NBA rep.

325
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,365
Word is, he had to give
Mother Superior a case of hand lotion,

326
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,865
just to close the deal.

327
00:25:16,063 --> 00:25:18,468
Wouldn't surprise me,
around here that stum is like gold.

328
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:19,667
Frankincense and Mer.

329
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:23,138
That's because it's the only gift
they're still allowed to keep.

330
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,071
ls that true?

331
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:27,577
Am l crazy or does the cook's shoes
clash with her belt today.

332
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:30,145
The woman has got a lot of shoes.

333
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,617
l liked it better when her uniform
smelled like mothballs and cigarettes.

334
00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:34,582
Yeah.

335
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:42,362
Catch. Pivot. And Pass.

336
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,828
Catch, pivot and pass.

337
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,195
Be careful, it's hot.

338
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:49,231
Let's go. Press break.

339
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:50,933
No, no, the other end.

340
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:52,234
Come on, come on.

341
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:53,435
Hustle up.

342
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:01,945
Move it. Move it. Move it.

343
00:26:02,075 --> 00:26:03,578
Good. Yes.

344
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,515
Ball movement and teamwork
that's how we break the press.

345
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:09,385
All right, let's run it again, come on.

346
00:26:09,616 --> 00:26:10,684
Good, good, good.

347
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:12,353
That's what l'm talking about.

348
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:22,330
Did you see that?

349
00:26:24,665 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah.

350
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:30,740
Well, that's exactly
why they're in first place.

351
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,084
Cathy, you...
mind if l get some work done here?

352
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:41,116
No, no, of course not.

353
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:45,255
See, they never let anyone
get an easy basket.

354
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:46,821
Cathy.

355
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:49,891
Great. Ah.

356
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:02,805
So, who here still
needs a ride to the game?

357
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:06,841
Does ah, anyone have a car?

358
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,812
Any parents going?

359
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:15,686
Really? Friends, family...

360
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,851
Nope.

361
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:19,522
Anybody know anyone
who can drive?

362
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:21,089
l can drive four.

363
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:26,998
Ah, great, well ah,
l can handle the rest.

364
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:28,430
Can l help you?

365
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,466
Yeah, l'm here for Trish.

366
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:32,433
He's my brother.

367
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:37,007
Okay, you can stay.
Thanks, Ralph.

368
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:42,079
All right, get some rest,
big day tomorrow.

369
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:47,752
Ah listen, you need to hury
the band practice is in an hour.

370
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:49,551
Girl's locker room?

371
00:27:49,683 --> 00:27:52,455
Right through there,
door marked, ''Ladies Room''.

372
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:56,459
Oh and ah,
the walls are out of bounds.

373
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:58,895
Thank you.

374
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,972
Come on in.

375
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,412
All right Rosemay, come on.

376
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:23,619
You okay, coach?

377
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:27,791
Sure. We'll get through this.

378
00:28:30,858 --> 00:28:34,699
l want each of you to
pin this on to your uniform.

379
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:36,264
Right.

380
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,947
As you think, so shall you be.

381
00:28:50,945 --> 00:28:52,414
All right. Listen up.

382
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,255
Sory.

383
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:06,730
All right. Let's go.

384
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:18,944
Come on...
kick the ball out, kick the ball out.

385
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:30,920
Trish.

386
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:34,023
Did you forget
your bathing cap, Mimi?

387
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:36,360
Did you forget there
were five of us?

388
00:29:49,671 --> 00:29:51,173
Good afternoon, Sister.

389
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,009
Good afternoon, Coach.

390
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:04,353
Heavenly Father.

391
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:09,560
l seek your help in this time of need.

392
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,128
There are times...

393
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:15,967
when we need the strength to
survive things on our own.

394
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,306
And then, there are times

395
00:30:22,638 --> 00:30:25,944
when we need your help
and the help of others.

396
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:29,747
And, l ask for your help
in finding me an assistant coach.

397
00:30:31,547 --> 00:30:34,252
Of course, she'll have to help me
find a gym to play our home game.

398
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:35,518
Hah.

399
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,988
And it'll be really great
if she had a car.

400
00:30:38,821 --> 00:30:40,925
Okay, now you're pushing it.

401
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,858
Well.

402
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,128
Oh, come on, you just need a driver.

403
00:30:45,294 --> 00:30:46,963
Look, we can do this.

404
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:48,898
Now it's a we?

405
00:30:49,131 --> 00:30:50,933
l know l can't do it alone.

406
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,435
Amen.

407
00:30:53,502 --> 00:30:56,608
Was than Amen, or l'm in?

408
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,644
Both.

409
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,560
Move the ball.

410
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,671
Get back, get back.

411
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,325
Little safer at the end of the bench.

412
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:51,794
What can l do for you Trish?

413
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,496
l got a job in a department store

414
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:55,632
and they need me
there three days a week.

415
00:31:57,399 --> 00:31:59,871
Well, we're going to miss you.

416
00:32:02,872 --> 00:32:04,274
Can l do both?

417
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,309
Oh, not in our program.

418
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:12,615
ls that job something
you've always dreamed of?

419
00:32:12,748 --> 00:32:13,749
No, not really.

420
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:18,256
But employees do
get fim percent discount.

421
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:20,557
l can only tell you this,

422
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,028
have the courage to
follow your dreams.

423
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:25,996
That's your gift to the world.

424
00:32:26,128 --> 00:32:28,599
Maybe it's working in
a department store, l don't know.

425
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,905
But, if you give that gift,
l promise,

426
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,639
a day will come when
the world returns the favor.

427
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,079
l thought dreams were
only for rich kids?

428
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:46,051
No, dreams are for eveybody,
all you need is the heart.

429
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:50,254
You have the gift to play this game,
Trish Sharkey.

430
00:32:50,954 --> 00:32:55,462
There is no doubt in my mind,
but you have to believe it.

431
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:02,666
You let me know what you decide,
all right?

432
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:12,942
So, what a million dollars?

433
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,080
Wouldn't it be better just to
borrow against the equih?

434
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:19,250
That would barely be enough
to pay for the upkeep.

435
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:21,485
But, where would my Sisters go?

436
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:26,694
We will have more than enough to
insure they enjoy a comfortable life.

437
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:28,492
But, what about the students?

438
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:32,597
There are plenh of colleges
in this area.

439
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:35,199
l might have a tough time
explaining this to my wife

440
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,434
and her former classmates.

441
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,704
But, if you could secure
a written offer

442
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:43,040
with those hpes of numbers,
we'd be foolish not to sell.

443
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,976
l move that we improve
the research of these activities

444
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:49,080
and ask that we reconvene
in nineh days.

445
00:33:52,314 --> 00:33:54,852
l, l think we'd be playing better
ifwe just had a few more things,

446
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:56,787
so l put a list together.

447
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:58,522
Here we go.

448
00:33:58,988 --> 00:34:00,925
Ah, you may not be able to
read my handwriting...

449
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:04,797
ah, new uniforms, ah warm ups and,
and, and team sneakers.

450
00:34:04,927 --> 00:34:08,233
Oh yes, well,
l'd be happy to be of assistance.

451
00:34:08,363 --> 00:34:09,499
Yeah?

452
00:34:09,732 --> 00:34:12,871
Sure, just follow me.
Let's see what we have.

453
00:34:56,244 --> 00:35:00,653
This is my room, you can help
yourself to anything l have.

454
00:35:19,134 --> 00:35:21,639
And then Mimi crashes
the boards hard.

455
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:30,546
Where you going?

456
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,719
Frankie, you have friends?

457
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:35,952
Aqm.

458
00:35:36,085 --> 00:35:37,488
Friends who play basketball?

459
00:35:37,687 --> 00:35:38,989
ls there another kind?

460
00:35:43,192 --> 00:35:45,195
Ohh, l hope this works.

461
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:29,775
Rosemay...
if Frankie is cutting through the lane,

462
00:36:29,906 --> 00:36:31,776
you need to keep contact with him.

463
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:34,446
lf he's going to be aggressive,
how should you play?

464
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:35,947
Same way.

465
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,049
Right on, but with a pony tail.

466
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:41,686
Let's go, ball in.

467
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:45,057
Sounds good. Good stum.

468
00:36:48,424 --> 00:36:50,795
lt's okay to pass the ball, Frankie.

469
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,462
Thank you.

470
00:36:59,435 --> 00:37:00,737
Flash to the ball

471
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:07,378
Good, good, good. Yes.

472
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,118
Blow the whistle.

473
00:37:17,453 --> 00:37:20,559
Hey, Colleen, you need to
get bemeen him and the basket.

474
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,527
How many times did Coach
go over this.

475
00:37:22,725 --> 00:37:25,832
See your man, and the ball...
okay.

476
00:37:25,963 --> 00:37:28,300
Know where he is at all times.

477
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:31,103
Find him and box up.

478
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:36,143
Stay with him, just like this,
don't let him get the rebound. Okay?

479
00:37:37,975 --> 00:37:39,778
Good job.

480
00:37:39,977 --> 00:37:43,818
Mrs. Rush,
may l have a word with you, please?

481
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:51,356
There are no men
allowed on this campus,

482
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:55,494
let alone having physical
contact with our girls.

483
00:37:55,625 --> 00:38:00,201
Now, send these boys home.
l've got my eye on you mo.

484
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:07,573
All right boys, ah,
that'll do for today.

485
00:38:18,582 --> 00:38:21,086
Reverend Mother
wasn't always this stressed.

486
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:26,093
When she first got here,
we'd stay up all night playing Poker.

487
00:38:26,422 --> 00:38:29,494
Of course, that's when they used to
give us walking around money.

488
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:32,898
She'd look at her cards,
Iay them down,

489
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:36,537
straighten out here cash and say...
be not afraid.

490
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:38,670
Then she'd bet evemhing.

491
00:38:39,468 --> 00:38:40,804
Boy, was she good.

492
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,807
Oh, she took a few bucks from me.

493
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:46,845
And that activih room
used to be packed,

494
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,383
l'd have to wait thim minutes
to get on the bike.

495
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:51,949
Those were the days.

496
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:55,453
People had
a little respect for the habit.

497
00:38:55,585 --> 00:38:57,455
Now look at us, in a few years,

498
00:38:57,587 --> 00:38:59,857
we're going to be
an exhibit at the Smithsonian.

499
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:02,727
We need to stick together.

500
00:39:03,293 --> 00:39:07,769
First mitch, oh,
somebody better help me out here.

501
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:14,039
Oh, bless you.

502
00:39:14,805 --> 00:39:16,240
Maybe you could
use some of your rec time

503
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,578
and come out and cheer
on the basketball team.

504
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:23,114
Watch the pick and roll.

505
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:29,887
Hold.

506
00:39:33,857 --> 00:39:34,825
Time out.

507
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:36,193
You got to get there sooner.

508
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:36,894
l tried.

509
00:39:37,027 --> 00:39:38,497
-Move your feet...
-you can't just stand there

510
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:39,863
after you get beat.

511
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:42,668
lf you call for help
and she helps you,

512
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:43,967
then you need to help her.

513
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:47,106
Help the helper,
that is the way it works.

514
00:39:47,237 --> 00:39:48,807
Does eveybody understand that?

515
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:56,114
Just play the team, all right.

516
00:39:56,947 --> 00:39:57,948
Bring it in.

517
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:02,621
One, mo, three, team.

518
00:40:04,521 --> 00:40:05,689
Team!

519
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:17,068
Help, help, help.

520
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:18,369
Help your man.

521
00:40:23,907 --> 00:40:26,545
Protect the basket,
come on, move your feet.

522
00:40:42,592 --> 00:40:44,062
You call that, defense?

523
00:40:44,661 --> 00:40:46,765
l need to find out
who wants to be here.

524
00:40:47,764 --> 00:40:49,868
Shake hands and get in the van.

525
00:40:51,235 --> 00:40:53,872
Come on, girls. Let's Go.
It's okay.

526
00:41:03,214 --> 00:41:04,249
What is she doing?

527
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:05,450
l don't know.

528
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:08,820
Watch your step, ladies.

529
00:41:13,623 --> 00:41:20,236
Come on, pick it up. Bring it in.

530
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:21,866
Colleen.

531
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:26,538
Come on, come on.

532
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,943
All right, take your jackets off.

533
00:41:31,508 --> 00:41:33,111
Jackets off.

534
00:41:36,147 --> 00:41:38,618
Let's go, defensive slide drills.

535
00:41:38,715 --> 00:41:39,583
Here?

536
00:41:39,716 --> 00:41:41,286
Defensive slide drills.

537
00:41:41,419 --> 00:41:42,821
Who's first?

538
00:41:45,156 --> 00:41:47,493
Mimi. You're up.

539
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:49,461
Palms up, back side down.

540
00:41:50,461 --> 00:41:54,468
Up and back. Go, go, go.

541
00:41:56,033 --> 00:41:59,472
Trish, Colleen, Gail,
Rosemay, come on, come on.

542
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:02,575
lf you want to stay dy,
you need to lift your feet.

543
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:06,180
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.

544
00:42:10,248 --> 00:42:11,550
l don't like this.

545
00:42:17,054 --> 00:42:17,654
Cathy, that's enough.

546
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:19,323
Here we go, here we go,
here we go, here we go.

547
00:42:19,457 --> 00:42:21,294
Again, here we go,
one more time.

548
00:42:21,425 --> 00:42:22,260
Get through.

549
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,130
Trish, get in there.
Lizanne, come on.

550
00:42:25,263 --> 00:42:27,266
Gail, Rosemay, come on, come on.

551
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:32,040
Our results will not change
until our habits change.

552
00:42:34,939 --> 00:42:36,274
Too dangerous.

553
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,375
Come on, come on.

554
00:42:39,677 --> 00:42:42,014
Come on.
Here we go, here we go.

555
00:42:42,914 --> 00:42:45,786
Get back in now, go, go, go.

556
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:49,355
Lower, lower, lower, lower, faster.

557
00:42:49,487 --> 00:42:51,057
Keep your feet dy.

558
00:42:52,356 --> 00:42:54,159
Are we in it together?

559
00:42:56,494 --> 00:42:57,964
Cathy, stop.

560
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:05,639
Here we go, you're not done.
Going back.

561
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:12,747
How much are you willing to sacrifice,
huh, how much?

562
00:43:12,877 --> 00:43:15,782
Come on, move, move, move.
There you go, there you go.

563
00:43:15,913 --> 00:43:17,315
There you go. Keep it going.

564
00:43:17,448 --> 00:43:18,617
Cathy, that's enough.

565
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:21,320
Here we go,
one more time, back in.

566
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:25,024
Keep your feet dy.

567
00:43:27,124 --> 00:43:29,127
Here we go, come on,
come on, come on.

568
00:43:29,727 --> 00:43:32,999
Cathy, stop. These girls were
sent here for an education.

569
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:35,200
ln what, historic preservation?

570
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:38,971
l'll see you in the morning.

571
00:43:46,944 --> 00:43:48,146
Hey.

572
00:43:55,886 --> 00:43:56,954
What?

573
00:43:57,788 --> 00:44:00,627
Maybe this isn't working out
the way we planned, huh?

574
00:44:00,758 --> 00:44:01,993
Well, you're going to have to adjust.

575
00:44:02,126 --> 00:44:04,330
Huh, l'm going to have to adjust?

576
00:44:04,463 --> 00:44:07,000
To what?
To never seeing each other, to ah...

577
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:09,335
never having dinner together,
to ah, ah,

578
00:44:09,468 --> 00:44:10,536
watching game films together.

579
00:44:10,668 --> 00:44:12,237
You know,
maybe l don't want to adjust, huh.

580
00:44:12,371 --> 00:44:13,205
lt's not my fault you're ah,

581
00:44:13,338 --> 00:44:17,011
spinning your wheels on something
that no one cares about, Cathy.

582
00:44:18,943 --> 00:44:20,446
l, l care.

583
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:22,447
What, you'd rather
l just sit at home all day

584
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:24,518
while you travel
allover the county?

585
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,021
Yes, you know,
l travel so l can pay for this apartment

586
00:44:27,151 --> 00:44:28,119
and evemhing else that's here.

587
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:30,122
What they pay you,
that's not even legal.

588
00:44:30,254 --> 00:44:32,359
All right, most women,
they would be grateful.

589
00:44:32,624 --> 00:44:33,692
Grateful?

590
00:44:34,225 --> 00:44:35,628
Hey, in the past three years,

591
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,396
do you know
what l've done with my free time.

592
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:41,302
l go to your games.
l find the time to support you.

593
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:44,804
So, l'm thinking you don't
understand what grateful is.

594
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:46,571
Ah, l didn't know
you were so unhappy.

595
00:44:46,704 --> 00:44:48,574
l am not unhappy.

596
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:50,776
Well, you don't sound
too happy right now.

597
00:44:51,209 --> 00:44:52,711
l'm frustrated, it's dimerent.

598
00:44:52,843 --> 00:44:55,348
Because you're tying
too hard to change these girls,

599
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,849
Cathy, and they don't want it.

600
00:44:56,981 --> 00:44:59,018
lt's not that they don't want it,

601
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,321
it's that they have been told
so long that they can't have it,

602
00:45:01,453 --> 00:45:04,492
that, that they can't
even imagine wanting it.

603
00:45:05,157 --> 00:45:07,093
You know, l can't even talk to you.

604
00:45:14,232 --> 00:45:15,801
Seven am, and ah...

605
00:45:16,301 --> 00:45:19,206
They're not here. It's okay.

606
00:45:20,238 --> 00:45:22,108
Maybe l pushed them too far.

607
00:45:27,044 --> 00:45:30,584
Maybe Ed is right,
and they're not like me,

608
00:45:31,383 --> 00:45:32,985
and they don't want what l want.

609
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:47,170
Mrs. Rush, your entire team
broke cumew last night.

610
00:45:47,332 --> 00:45:49,035
We've never had that before,

611
00:45:49,534 --> 00:45:52,806
nor have we had anyone
endanger the lives of the girls.

612
00:45:52,937 --> 00:45:53,338
l...

613
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:58,248
Now, that is unacceptable.
You leave me no choice.

614
00:45:58,376 --> 00:45:59,945
lt was my idea.

615
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:02,780
l should have known.

616
00:46:04,616 --> 00:46:08,590
So, you finish out the season,
and then that's it.

617
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:12,493
Don't be surprised
if all the others quit, too.

618
00:46:16,728 --> 00:46:18,231
You didn't have to do that.

619
00:46:18,363 --> 00:46:21,535
l know. But, we can't give up.

620
00:46:23,435 --> 00:46:27,242
l don't know if you've noticed, but...
we have no team.

621
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:05,711
Rosemay, you're going to
force the ball in the sidelines.

622
00:47:05,844 --> 00:47:07,713
Now, l need you
to keep your feet dy.

623
00:47:07,846 --> 00:47:08,713
You got that?

624
00:47:08,847 --> 00:47:11,685
Trish, Trish, you're going to
sneak in and double team.

625
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:13,988
Don't reach,
no don't reach because, Gail,

626
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:16,924
l want to anticipate this pass
across court, you got that?

627
00:47:17,055 --> 00:47:17,522
Here we go.

628
00:47:17,656 --> 00:47:20,896
Yeah.... one, mo, three, team!

629
00:47:21,026 --> 00:47:24,265
One, mo, three, team!
Go, yeah. Get in there.

630
00:47:25,263 --> 00:47:29,004
Go girls. Right, right, right.

631
00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:32,839
Go, go. Nice.

632
00:47:35,307 --> 00:47:37,277
Yes, yes, yes.

633
00:47:37,409 --> 00:47:39,279
Yes, yes, yes.

634
00:47:39,878 --> 00:47:41,681
That's what l'm talking about.

635
00:48:00,498 --> 00:48:01,601
What?

636
00:48:02,334 --> 00:48:03,603
Nothing.

637
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:05,437
May l help you ladies?

638
00:48:05,872 --> 00:48:07,374
Coldest thing on tap.

639
00:48:07,505 --> 00:48:07,873
Okay.

640
00:48:08,006 --> 00:48:10,644
-l'll ah, have the same.
-Okay.

641
00:48:10,877 --> 00:48:12,680
Oh and ah,
melve number mos to go.

642
00:48:12,812 --> 00:48:14,114
You got it.

643
00:48:16,314 --> 00:48:18,251
And put those drinks on my tab.

644
00:48:18,383 --> 00:48:20,888
Oh no, you, you don't have to do that.
It's fine.

645
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:22,221
Thank you.

646
00:48:27,158 --> 00:48:28,360
Just passing through?

647
00:48:28,494 --> 00:48:29,729
Aren't we all.

648
00:48:30,529 --> 00:48:32,666
l like a woman with
a sense of humor

649
00:48:32,798 --> 00:48:36,104
but l bet a prem gal such as
yourself must be hitched?

650
00:48:36,334 --> 00:48:37,804
You could say that.

651
00:48:38,336 --> 00:48:39,806
What's the old man do?

652
00:48:42,974 --> 00:48:46,715
He's ah... carpenter.

653
00:48:46,812 --> 00:48:48,415
He's good with his hands, is he?

654
00:48:49,147 --> 00:48:50,917
Works miracles.

655
00:48:52,785 --> 00:48:53,553
And you?

656
00:48:53,686 --> 00:48:57,593
Ah... my husband's also vey good
with his hands, thanks for asking.

657
00:48:57,989 --> 00:48:59,492
The good ones are always taken.

658
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,930
Ah, do you ladies like to dance?

659
00:49:04,697 --> 00:49:06,434
Thank you, but we'll have to pass.

660
00:49:06,565 --> 00:49:08,335
Ah, girls night out.

661
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:12,274
l can respect that.
You ladies have a nice evening.

662
00:49:12,371 --> 00:49:13,539
You, too.

663
00:49:16,107 --> 00:49:18,010
You are trouble.

664
00:49:20,313 --> 00:49:21,848
Takes one to know one.

665
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,082
Nice win.

666
00:49:24,182 --> 00:49:25,385
Who's in?

667
00:49:25,518 --> 00:49:26,118
l am.

668
00:49:26,252 --> 00:49:27,754
Ah, Math.

669
00:49:27,853 --> 00:49:30,325
Who do you pray to when you need
help balancing your checkbook?

670
00:49:30,456 --> 00:49:32,259
Ah, l just pray to my Dad.

671
00:49:32,725 --> 00:49:35,162
My Dad would kill me
if he knew l was going to college.

672
00:49:35,294 --> 00:49:35,994
What?

673
00:49:36,127 --> 00:49:37,797
Daddy, l'm thinking about
becoming a Nun,

674
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:39,633
and would love to volunteer
at Immaculata.

675
00:49:39,765 --> 00:49:40,867
He don't know?

676
00:49:40,999 --> 00:49:43,237
No. Now he thinks l'm the team Nurse.

677
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:44,437
Does Coach know?

678
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:48,244
Yeah. She said we'd wait for
a quiet moment to let him know.

679
00:49:49,608 --> 00:49:53,215
So, when did you... know?

680
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,184
l'd been with this ad agency for...

681
00:49:56,482 --> 00:50:00,189
four years,
finally got my first big promotion,

682
00:50:01,086 --> 00:50:03,524
and l felt, nothing.

683
00:50:03,823 --> 00:50:08,098
l woke up the next day, and, thought.

684
00:50:08,294 --> 00:50:10,631
There has to be
more to life than this?

685
00:50:10,763 --> 00:50:12,266
So you just... Ieft?

686
00:50:12,398 --> 00:50:15,270
Well, the first thing l did
was break up with my boyfriend.

687
00:50:15,601 --> 00:50:17,171
You had a boyfriend?

688
00:50:19,672 --> 00:50:22,077
l was menh-six and living
in Manhattan.

689
00:50:22,308 --> 00:50:23,877
So. do, do you ever miss it?

690
00:50:24,443 --> 00:50:25,611
Sometimes.

691
00:50:26,712 --> 00:50:30,152
But, my whole life l had listened
to others tell me what l should do.

692
00:50:31,117 --> 00:50:35,391
And this time, l listened to
that little voice inside of me.

693
00:50:35,521 --> 00:50:36,456
Uh.

694
00:50:38,157 --> 00:50:41,429
So, l quit my job and took
a bus to Immaculata.

695
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:42,728
Why there?

696
00:50:43,262 --> 00:50:48,005
l had this great, Immaculate Heart
of May Nun, in high school.

697
00:50:48,134 --> 00:50:50,938
She whispered something to me
that l'll never forget.

698
00:50:52,738 --> 00:50:54,976
Jesus likes to dance.

699
00:50:56,809 --> 00:50:58,913
That's how l reacted too.

700
00:50:59,078 --> 00:51:01,582
lt forever changed the way
l look at things.

701
00:51:01,747 --> 00:51:03,952
Like, the whole wedding
an canna thing,

702
00:51:04,316 --> 00:51:07,388
apparently he was having
a good time and wanted to stay.

703
00:51:08,654 --> 00:51:10,357
Oh, it sounds just like Ed.

704
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:15,866
l mean, not that Ed is like you.
He really loves to dance.

705
00:51:18,899 --> 00:51:20,368
Have you told him lately??

706
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:23,536
Told him what?

707
00:51:24,503 --> 00:51:26,306
How much you love him.

708
00:51:26,873 --> 00:51:27,807
Yeah, sure.

709
00:51:29,675 --> 00:51:32,680
l mean, not exactly.

710
00:51:32,813 --> 00:51:36,352
Ah, a little hectic lately. Umh.

711
00:51:38,684 --> 00:51:40,154
That's why l'm asking.

712
00:51:42,856 --> 00:51:45,126
Since when did you become
so perceptive?

713
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,769
l'm just saying...
keep your eye on the ball, Coach.

714
00:51:57,737 --> 00:52:01,878
So, you think you'll stay?

715
00:52:02,876 --> 00:52:04,578
lf it's meant to be.

716
00:53:24,124 --> 00:53:26,596
One, mo, three, team!

717
00:53:27,194 --> 00:53:29,097
That's it, come on. Let's go.

718
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:47,082
Come on, Trish. Come on, come on.

719
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:56,623
Here we go.

720
00:54:02,162 --> 00:54:03,063
Alright.

721
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,403
There you go!

722
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,910
Run it out, run it out.

723
00:54:17,777 --> 00:54:18,778
Let's go, Rosemay.

724
00:54:19,479 --> 00:54:20,447
That's her.

725
00:54:21,414 --> 00:54:22,349
Who?

726
00:54:22,649 --> 00:54:23,717
My old coach.

727
00:54:40,367 --> 00:54:42,771
Great game. Great game.

728
00:54:45,605 --> 00:54:47,608
Looks like l might
have been wrong about you.

729
00:54:47,741 --> 00:54:48,576
Well, thank you.

730
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:51,513
Next time, you play the Varsih.

731
00:54:55,382 --> 00:54:56,584
What was that about?

732
00:54:57,017 --> 00:54:59,255
l started Freshman
and Sophmore year,

733
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:01,756
after that she cut me, mice.

734
00:55:01,988 --> 00:55:02,889
Why?

735
00:55:03,124 --> 00:55:05,194
Said l wasn't a team player.

736
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,835
Hello.

737
00:55:14,968 --> 00:55:17,173
Hey, it's me.

738
00:55:17,437 --> 00:55:20,209
Hey. Where are you,
l thought you'd be home by now?

739
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:23,212
Yeah, the train got delayed
and l'm stuck in Newark.

740
00:55:24,111 --> 00:55:24,911
What?

741
00:55:25,046 --> 00:55:26,214
Yeah, l know.

742
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:27,914
Hey, how was your game?

743
00:55:28,149 --> 00:55:29,384
We won.

744
00:55:29,716 --> 00:55:30,717
That's great.

745
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:31,818
How did you do

746
00:55:31,951 --> 00:55:32,552
l did all right.

747
00:55:32,686 --> 00:55:34,689
lt was close, but l, l did all right.

748
00:55:35,323 --> 00:55:38,762
Oh, we're leaving now, so ah,
l'll see you in a few hours.

749
00:55:38,892 --> 00:55:41,797
Okay, travel safely, all right.

750
00:55:42,762 --> 00:55:47,104

751
00:55:48,768 --> 00:55:50,271

752
00:55:51,438 --> 00:55:52,573
Hey, honey.

753
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:53,740
Yeah?

754
00:55:54,008 --> 00:55:55,810
Thanks for asking about my game.

755
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:57,312
You're welcome.

756
00:56:49,163 --> 00:56:50,331
Where did you guys meet?

757
00:56:50,563 --> 00:56:52,033
At a basketball campus.

758
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:54,837
Did you know right away
that he was the one?

759
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:56,771
l did.

760
00:56:57,437 --> 00:56:58,973
How did he propose?

761
00:56:59,306 --> 00:57:00,909
What makes you think he proposed?

762
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:02,811
Really?

763
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,114
No, but l thought about it.

764
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,717
Was it fun shopping for a dress?

765
00:57:08,282 --> 00:57:09,384
Well, my Mother made it.

766
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:10,952
Did you have a good wedding?

767
00:57:11,252 --> 00:57:14,324
No, we eloped and then ah,
came back and had a pam.

768
00:57:14,454 --> 00:57:15,455
That's so meet.

769
00:57:15,588 --> 00:57:17,926
l can't wait for my wedding day.

770
00:57:20,194 --> 00:57:22,431
Nine, ten...

771
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:28,736
Good afternoon, girls.

772
00:57:28,869 --> 00:57:30,772
Hi Coach.

773
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:42,686
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

774
00:57:42,817 --> 00:57:44,019
Where's Lizanne?

775
00:57:44,552 --> 00:57:46,021
No one's seen her all day.

776
00:57:46,387 --> 00:57:47,890
Well, was she in class?

777
00:57:49,023 --> 00:57:50,593
No, Coach, she wasn't.

778
00:57:55,663 --> 00:57:56,865
Again.

779
00:58:05,272 --> 00:58:07,510
That's nineh dollars and fim cents.

780
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:08,174
Thank you.

781
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:09,377
You're welcome.

782
00:58:18,052 --> 00:58:19,154
Have a great day.

783
00:58:34,602 --> 00:58:35,503
l got it.

784
00:58:41,775 --> 00:58:44,514
Thanks for the jackets,
have a nice day.

785
00:58:55,055 --> 00:58:56,223
Oh, hello, Coach.

786
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:57,792
Thanks for coming.

787
00:58:57,925 --> 00:58:59,027
She still in bed?

788
00:58:59,193 --> 00:59:01,531
Yes. Come in.

789
00:59:09,136 --> 00:59:10,272
Hey, Coach.

790
00:59:11,473 --> 00:59:12,675
We missed you today.

791
00:59:14,975 --> 00:59:15,976
l'm sory.

792
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,749
Give us a few minutes.

793
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,283
She's a mass.

794
00:59:31,959 --> 00:59:33,094
You okay?

795
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:35,197
Yeah.

796
00:59:44,506 --> 00:59:46,843
Breaking up is the worst.

797
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:49,978
l know there is nothing
l can say right now

798
00:59:50,111 --> 00:59:51,713
to make you feel better, but...

799
00:59:51,845 --> 00:59:53,782
l just loved him so much.

800
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:58,889
Hey. What are some of the things
he's going to miss about you?

801
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:02,324
Right now? Nothing.

802
01:00:02,457 --> 01:00:06,631
Not true.
What makes you such a special person?

803
01:00:09,598 --> 01:00:13,439
l know the anmer
but l want you to tell me.

804
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:15,371
l'm bilingual.

805
01:00:16,605 --> 01:00:17,606
Okay.

806
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,377
And l think
l'm a prem good dancer.

807
01:00:20,874 --> 01:00:24,181
You know, for a Catholic girl.

808
01:00:24,346 --> 01:00:25,514
Go on.

809
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:33,394
And l... and l think l'm prem,
probably not right now.

810
01:00:33,521 --> 01:00:38,264
You are. All of those things,
even right now.

811
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,628
And, what you think of
yourself

812
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,832
is way more important
than what he thinks of you.

813
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,701
This isn't you.

814
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:50,274
Don't let his jacket define
who you are.

815
01:00:56,744 --> 01:01:00,118
This is who you are.

816
01:01:01,549 --> 01:01:02,450
Ty it on.

817
01:01:07,422 --> 01:01:08,757
Might be easier
if you stand up.

818
01:01:19,733 --> 01:01:21,336
You've earned this jacket,

819
01:01:22,037 --> 01:01:26,712
and nobody can take it
away from you. Right?

820
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:29,980
The team's waiting for you.

821
01:01:32,213 --> 01:01:33,381
Coach.

822
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,485
Thank you.

823
01:02:08,883 --> 01:02:10,620
l've already phoned
our Sisters in Baltimore.

824
01:02:10,752 --> 01:02:14,058
Good. Now let's go
talk to Mother Superior, huh?

825
01:02:14,623 --> 01:02:18,964
Come on. It'll be all right.
Trust me.

826
01:02:20,428 --> 01:02:22,966
The ah,
retiring Nuns will move together

827
01:02:23,098 --> 01:02:25,603
and live at the Mother House.

828
01:02:25,735 --> 01:02:30,811
Excuse us... but we have some
vey exciting news to share.

829
01:02:30,939 --> 01:02:32,308
We're in a meeting here.

830
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,947
l understand, but we got invited to
the Regional Championships. Huh.

831
01:02:36,077 --> 01:02:39,984
Well, that's vey nice, Mrs. Rush,
but now is not the time.

832
01:02:40,115 --> 01:02:42,118
What year are you in, young lady?

833
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,755
Oh, ah, l'm not a student, Mr. McHail.

834
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:47,123
And, l know it's Mr. McHail,
cause l go to your bank.

835
01:02:47,255 --> 01:02:49,994
l, l cash my checks there.
My own paycheck.

836
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:51,995
We coach the basketball team,

837
01:02:52,127 --> 01:02:54,799
we got invited to the Regionals
in Baltimore.

838
01:02:54,929 --> 01:02:57,233
We just needed some more money
to get the kids there.

839
01:02:57,566 --> 01:03:00,070
Mrs. Rush, l'm afraid at this time,

840
01:03:00,201 --> 01:03:02,839
we have more important issues
to deal with.

841
01:03:02,971 --> 01:03:05,041
There has to be
something we can do?

842
01:03:05,441 --> 01:03:08,914
Please except my apologies
for this interruption.

843
01:03:09,043 --> 01:03:11,313
Would you please excuse us?

844
01:03:14,883 --> 01:03:17,655
We can't give up,
we've worked too hard.

845
01:03:17,787 --> 01:03:19,590
You must leave now.

846
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:22,793
Do you understand the commitment
these girls have made?

847
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,026
Young lady, l don't believe you

848
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,597
understand the meaning of
the word, commitment.

849
01:03:26,729 --> 01:03:28,966
lf it means not giving up when
no one else believes in you,

850
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:33,339
and, and, and, if it means showing up
evey daywhen all hope seems gone.

851
01:03:33,602 --> 01:03:35,505
Then l do know what it means.

852
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:38,576
But, l didn't really understand that
until l got here.

853
01:03:39,575 --> 01:03:40,944
l know you're tying to
save this place,

854
01:03:41,075 --> 01:03:42,878
but the only way
to protect these girls

855
01:03:43,011 --> 01:03:46,485
and to protect your future
is to make them stronger.

856
01:03:46,715 --> 01:03:49,353
And, we do that by working together.

857
01:03:49,518 --> 01:03:53,592
There will always be other people
who think they have a better plan,

858
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:59,098
but at some point, we have to
stand up for what we believe in.

859
01:04:00,161 --> 01:04:02,666
My goals are
no dimerent than yours.

860
01:04:06,034 --> 01:04:07,237
Good afternoon.

861
01:04:20,048 --> 01:04:22,920
We will have three offers
before the end of the day.

862
01:04:30,793 --> 01:04:32,196
Who put this here?

863
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:37,102
Who's button is this?

864
01:04:42,338 --> 01:04:45,911
Well, we're not going to eat
until someone steps forward.

865
01:04:56,951 --> 01:04:58,554
lt must be yours.

866
01:05:09,365 --> 01:05:11,535
We can't really call it
a rematch then.

867
01:05:11,966 --> 01:05:13,469
No, ah, but ifwe win,

868
01:05:13,602 --> 01:05:15,639
we'll get one of the melve
automatic bids for the nationals.

869
01:05:15,771 --> 01:05:18,076
lfwe lose, we meat it out with
the rest of the county.

870
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:19,944
Four large bids.

871
01:05:21,577 --> 01:05:23,647
His wife was Immaculata.

872
01:05:23,779 --> 01:05:25,916
No kidding. Excuse me.

873
01:05:28,851 --> 01:05:31,189
Ah, l already have one of those.

874
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,691
Oh no, it's not for you,
it's for your wife.

875
01:05:35,892 --> 01:05:37,094
Thank you.

876
01:05:59,715 --> 01:06:01,652
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in.
Right now.

877
01:06:02,017 --> 01:06:04,721
All right, listen up. Play our game.

878
01:06:04,854 --> 01:06:07,058
Our game, all right?

Yes. Wow.

942
01:12:59,336 --> 01:12:59,770
Here?

943
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,704
Yeah.

944
01:13:00,904 --> 01:13:02,641
Okay, wait, what are
we supposed to say to people?

945
01:13:02,773 --> 01:13:03,841
l've never done this before.

946
01:13:04,074 --> 01:13:08,783

Hi.

950
01:13:28,065 --> 01:13:30,169
Good afternoon, my friend and l...

951
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:33,039
...are selling Men's soothing creams.

952
01:13:33,371 --> 01:13:34,473
Yeah, for just a dollar,

953
01:13:34,605 --> 01:13:37,644
it's pemect for things like
dy hands, dy elbows...

954
01:13:37,841 --> 01:13:38,342
Oh yeah?

955
01:13:38,475 --> 01:13:39,877
And dy feet.

956
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:42,782
And...
you know what, it might help if...

957
01:13:42,913 --> 01:13:46,387
my friend Lizanne here could,
put some on your feet.

958
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,755
Thank you.

959
01:13:53,324 --> 01:13:55,461
Sir, you forgot your lotion.

960
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,875
How does it feel?

961
01:14:11,675 --> 01:14:14,147
Ah, great, great.

962
01:14:14,379 --> 01:14:15,547
You're doing great.

963
01:14:19,317 --> 01:14:22,089
We could only sell enough
for four one way tickets.

964
01:14:24,021 --> 01:14:27,026
And you know,
mo Sisters can apply for free.

965
01:14:27,392 --> 01:14:28,827
That's still not enough.

966
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,330
Even ifwe left now
and drove through the night,

967
01:14:31,463 --> 01:14:34,101
we would be in no condition
to play the number mo seat.

968
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:41,907
Are you sure
we've done evemhing we can?

969
01:15:08,765 --> 01:15:11,403
This should be enough to
get your players there.

970
01:15:17,608 --> 01:15:19,044
Be not afraid.

971
01:15:29,254 --> 01:15:30,789
Final boarding call to Chicago.

972
01:15:30,922 --> 01:15:32,624
Final boarding call to Chicago.

973
01:15:32,756 --> 01:15:34,159
Final boarding call to Chicago.

974
01:15:43,767 --> 01:15:45,504
You know this is a sin, right?

975
01:15:47,472 --> 01:15:50,812
Ohhh, l intend on paying them back.

976
01:15:50,942 --> 01:15:52,377
l'll hold you to that.

977
01:15:55,179 --> 01:15:56,581
l have a confession.

978
01:15:57,081 --> 01:15:58,716
The habit will do that to you....

979
01:15:59,884 --> 01:16:01,453
l'm not Catholic.

980
01:16:03,154 --> 01:16:04,456
What?

981
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:06,793
l'm Baptist.

982
01:16:07,725 --> 01:16:08,525
You are?

983
01:16:08,659 --> 01:16:09,862
Uh huh.

984
01:16:11,662 --> 01:16:14,367
But... you, you believe?

985
01:16:16,801 --> 01:16:18,470
Above all else.

986
01:16:23,374 --> 01:16:25,077
Then we are Sisters.

987
01:16:26,878 --> 01:16:29,082
Standby passengers,
Sister Sunday, Standby passenger,

988
01:16:29,213 --> 01:16:31,116
Sister Catherine to Atlantic Cih.

989
01:16:32,717 --> 01:16:33,718
Amen.

990
01:16:34,886 --> 01:16:36,188
Don't you get hot in these things?

991
01:16:36,321 --> 01:16:37,791
lt ain't easy, Sister.

992
01:16:41,225 --> 01:16:45,032
Open, open, go, go.

993
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,270
Break the ball, break the ball.

994
01:16:53,938 --> 01:16:55,473
Hit it. Yes.

995
01:16:55,608 --> 01:16:57,545
Go with it, go with it.

996
01:16:57,842 --> 01:16:59,946
That's the way girls, that's the way.

997
01:17:05,717 --> 01:17:08,121
Hands up, hands up.

998
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:14,394
Crush her, crush her, crush her.

999
01:17:15,927 --> 01:17:16,628
Crush her.

1000
01:17:19,931 --> 01:17:23,103
That's right, push it, push it.
Come on.

1001
01:17:42,887 --> 01:17:44,490
-Right. Yes.
-Yes.

1002
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:48,026
Ed, we got your order.

1003
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,261
Thanks.

1004
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:53,836
You tell me if Immaculata won.
Yes! Thanks.

1005
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,252
lmmaculata is clinging on to

1006
01:18:13,385 --> 01:18:16,089
a one point lead at the final minute of play.

1007
01:18:16,954 --> 01:18:18,724
Don't give up the base line.

1008
01:18:18,856 --> 01:18:19,791
...that the heavily favorite,

1009
01:18:19,924 --> 01:18:23,163
Mississippi State dribble the ball,
side to side.

1010
01:18:23,295 --> 01:18:24,830
The fans are on their feet.

1011
01:18:24,929 --> 01:18:27,668
And that's mostly to defend the ball.

1012
01:18:27,865 --> 01:18:31,339
Dribble private a pass shot is up
and good, and a foul.

1013
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:35,211
Oh no.
Mississippi State takes the lead.

1014
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,746
There's the foul shot,
it's up and good.

1015
01:18:38,943 --> 01:18:41,548
lmmaculata now trails by mo.

1016
01:18:44,048 --> 01:18:46,453
And the Macs
push the ball up the court.

1017
01:18:46,585 --> 01:18:50,091
On three, on three. Okay.

1018
01:18:51,557 --> 01:18:53,861
Looking, looking for the open shot.

1019
01:18:54,025 --> 01:18:58,901
Pass to Lizanne Caufield,
she's clear, it's up, it's good.

1020
01:18:58,963 --> 01:19:02,035
lt's good. The match is tied up.

1021
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:05,139
Vey, vey, vey good. All right.

1022
01:19:05,437 --> 01:19:08,442
This is what
we've been working for all year.

1023
01:19:08,674 --> 01:19:11,279
This is why we have made sacrifices.

1024
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:16,219
To defend this moment, right now,
and we are ready, okay?

1025
01:19:16,348 --> 01:19:18,685
Remember, push the ball left,
move those feet,

1026
01:19:18,816 --> 01:19:20,653
and know your teammates
are there to help you.

1027
01:19:20,785 --> 01:19:21,720
Here we go.

1028
01:19:23,088 --> 01:19:26,327
One, mo, three, team.
Get out there.

1029
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:29,764
Well folks, it looks like it'll
come down to one final play to see

1030
01:19:29,894 --> 01:19:33,234
who will advance to
the National Championship game.

1031
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:38,005
Mississippi State races up the floor.

1032
01:19:38,203 --> 01:19:39,838
More to the left, more to the left.

1033
01:19:39,972 --> 01:19:45,248
There's a pass. A dribble drive.
And Macs poke it free.

1034
01:19:45,544 --> 01:19:46,947
Loose ball!

1035
01:19:49,982 --> 01:19:51,484
The Macs have it.

1036
01:19:53,552 --> 01:19:54,487
Shot!

1037
01:19:58,957 --> 01:20:01,761
No good, no good.

1038
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:05,866
No good, and we're headed to
overtime, but wait, wait

1039
01:20:05,998 --> 01:20:07,734
The Referees confer.

1040
01:20:09,535 --> 01:20:11,005
What's wrong, Coach.

1041
01:20:13,472 --> 01:20:16,946
Before the end of regulation,
foul to one.

1042
01:20:17,309 --> 01:20:19,579
The Macs have one more chance.

1043
01:20:23,315 --> 01:20:25,018
Number 12, you pick the court.

1044
01:20:25,751 --> 01:20:28,556
Trish Sharkey's going to
go to the line for mo.

1045
01:20:28,921 --> 01:20:32,494
Going to make that
Ionely walk out to the free throw line.

1046
01:20:32,691 --> 01:20:34,661
There's a lot of
pressure on a young girl.

1047
01:20:50,509 --> 01:20:51,510
And she misses.

1048
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:53,814
Time out, time out. Come on.

1049
01:20:55,147 --> 01:20:56,382
Have a seat, have a seat.

1050
01:20:56,515 --> 01:20:57,283
l'm fine, l'm fine.

1051
01:20:57,416 --> 01:20:58,518
Here's some water.

1052
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:00,721
Listen to me, you can do this, Trish.

1053
01:21:00,854 --> 01:21:03,091
Just trust your shot,
bend your knees.

1054
01:21:03,222 --> 01:21:07,063
And, don't forget to breathe.
All right? Good.

1055
01:21:08,627 --> 01:21:09,930
All right, let's go.

1056
01:21:10,062 --> 01:21:14,170
Here we go again,
Sharkey walks the plank.

1057
01:21:14,266 --> 01:21:17,105
She's now four for nine
from the Charih stripe.

1058
01:21:24,576 --> 01:21:25,344
She dribbles.

1059
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:31,784
Shoots.

1060
01:21:34,519 --> 01:21:35,722
lt's good.

1061
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:40,360
Yes. Yes.

1062
01:21:42,227 --> 01:21:46,034
Finally, Immaculata College
is going to the finals.

1063
01:21:46,532 --> 01:21:47,867
One more.

1064
01:21:50,202 --> 01:21:55,880
Light another candle, Sister Regina,
this dream is still alive.

1065
01:21:56,975 --> 01:21:58,812
What if they full court press?

1066
01:21:59,512 --> 01:22:03,486
We go upside down, oven mitts on,
center and forward bring the ball up,

1067
01:22:03,616 --> 01:22:06,020
Trish and Rosemay are
speed to go to the basket.

1068
01:22:06,151 --> 01:22:07,687
What if they don't press?

1069
01:22:08,888 --> 01:22:11,158
We put the winter clothes on.

1070
01:22:12,291 --> 01:22:13,794
l don't know that one.

1071
01:22:15,093 --> 01:22:19,969
lt means, it'll be a cold day in hell,
she'll never adjust.

1072
01:22:26,873 --> 01:22:27,941
l think we're ready.

1073
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:32,012
Guess we're about to find out.

1074
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:39,218
No matter what happens tomorrow,

1075
01:22:40,687 --> 01:22:43,191
l want to thank you for
what you've done for me this year.

1076
01:22:43,623 --> 01:22:47,464
You are a team player,
you have helped the helpers.

1077
01:22:47,627 --> 01:22:48,160
No. You don't need to...

1078
01:22:48,293 --> 01:22:49,094
No, no, no, no.

1079
01:22:49,227 --> 01:22:51,498
You listen to me, Cathy Rush.

1080
01:22:51,864 --> 01:22:55,471
You taught me,
that not only is change possible,

1081
01:22:56,936 --> 01:22:58,673
it's as vital as breathing.

1082
01:23:00,205 --> 01:23:05,549
And, not only that,
you also taught me and all my Sisters

1083
01:23:06,879 --> 01:23:09,784
that sometimes Angels
wear high heels.

1084
01:23:09,949 --> 01:23:12,688
This is the corniest thing
l have ever heard.

1085
01:23:29,836 --> 01:23:36,683
Do you not know that in a race,
all the runners compete.

1086
01:23:38,244 --> 01:23:41,450
But only one receives the prize.

1087
01:23:42,849 --> 01:23:48,059
So, run that you may obtain it.
Corithians.

1088
01:23:48,855 --> 01:23:51,160
You've earned the right to run tonight.

1089
01:23:51,891 --> 01:23:54,229
And it's okay to want the prize.

1090
01:23:57,964 --> 01:24:02,873
Lizanne, do you know
why teams get to the championship?

1091
01:24:03,236 --> 01:24:04,271
Trust.

1092
01:24:05,772 --> 01:24:08,344
Yeah, that's why they
get to the championship.

1093
01:24:09,142 --> 01:24:12,314
Do you know
why they win the championship?

1094
01:24:15,348 --> 01:24:16,450
Anyone?

1095
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:24,961
l want all of you
to point to yourselves.

1096
01:24:32,098 --> 01:24:33,400
That's right.

1097
01:24:34,667 --> 01:24:36,470
Look where you're all pointing.

1098
01:24:40,807 --> 01:24:41,808
This.

1099
01:24:41,942 --> 01:24:48,587
This is why, this is
where championships are won.

1100
01:24:50,283 --> 01:24:53,555
One team, one beat.

1101
01:24:54,922 --> 01:24:58,094
This is what keeps us alive,
but we can't even see it.

1102
01:25:00,426 --> 01:25:05,002
It's not about what we wear
or where we live,

1103
01:25:05,131 --> 01:25:07,134
or how much money we have.

1104
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,070
That's how they see us.

1105
01:25:09,202 --> 01:25:11,673
That's how they judge us.

1106
01:25:12,205 --> 01:25:14,877
None of that matters.

1107
01:25:15,109 --> 01:25:21,421
Because, what they don't know
is that we will win tonight.

1108
01:25:21,681 --> 01:25:26,257
And we will win because of
the things they cannot see.

1109
01:25:27,788 --> 01:25:29,557
One minute.

1110
01:25:34,928 --> 01:25:36,163
Coach.

1111
01:25:44,805 --> 01:25:47,810
Eveyone. Take a knee.

1112
01:25:53,113 --> 01:25:54,749
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

1113
01:25:54,882 --> 01:25:57,019
and welcome to
the First National Championship

1114
01:25:57,151 --> 01:25:59,789
for Women's college basketball.

1115
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,857
Tonight, it's histoy in the making,

1116
01:26:01,989 --> 01:26:05,228
as the Golden Rams of
West Chester State College

1117
01:26:05,358 --> 01:26:08,497
face the Macs of
Immaculata College.

1118
01:26:10,263 --> 01:26:13,135
The tension is building here inside the arena

1119
01:26:13,266 --> 01:26:16,606
as the Immaculata faithful rise to their feet.

1120
01:26:17,938 --> 01:26:20,743
And the Mighh Macs
are taking the floor.

1121
01:26:21,008 --> 01:26:23,680
This is one of
the most improbably championship

1122
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:25,914
match ups in sports histoy.

1123
01:26:26,046 --> 01:26:30,889
The pint size Papal institution
received one of the four large bids

1124
01:26:31,018 --> 01:26:35,059
and was seated in number fifteen
out of sixteen teams.

1125
01:26:35,254 --> 01:26:38,159
lt was just one week ago
that these mo teams

1126
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:40,896
played for an automatic
bid to the Nationals,

1127
01:26:41,028 --> 01:26:44,267
and Immaculata lost
by fom-mo points.

1128
01:26:44,397 --> 01:26:46,568
How will this faimale end?

1129
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:49,906
Will the glass slipper fit head
Coach Cathy Rush

1130
01:26:50,037 --> 01:26:52,074
and her little sisters of the floor?

1131
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:56,380
The anmer lies somewhere
bemeen Heaven and the hardwood.

1132
01:26:57,010 --> 01:26:57,978
You got to go.

1133
01:26:58,244 --> 01:27:00,882
Westchester State
usually ins the championship.

1134
01:27:01,748 --> 01:27:02,983
lt's pushing forward.

1135
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:08,392
That's an easy layup
...setting up the defense.

1136
01:27:08,622 --> 01:27:10,759
Macs are fighting to get open.

1137
01:27:11,558 --> 01:27:12,626
Get it to her...

1138
01:27:13,827 --> 01:27:17,200
And a... they're tying to
get it in, passed the ball to...

1139
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:19,000
and the Golden Rams steal it.

1140
01:27:25,038 --> 01:27:28,043
To the net... to the net. The net.

1141
01:27:30,477 --> 01:27:34,351
Macs stay in bounds,
quick passed the middle.

1142
01:27:34,548 --> 01:27:35,650
Vey nice.

1143
01:27:35,749 --> 01:27:40,358
...move the ball up the floor.
Here's another pass and they score.

1144
01:27:40,454 --> 01:27:45,730
Yes, that's teamwork.
Here we go. Yes. Yes, yes.

1145
01:27:45,859 --> 01:27:47,862
lmmaculata pressuring the ball.

1146
01:27:47,995 --> 01:27:51,736
The Macs are all over the floor...
coasted free.

1147
01:27:51,865 --> 01:27:56,173
And the floor, picking up loose ball,
bounce by layup, score.

1148
01:27:59,873 --> 01:28:01,843
They're putting the ball around.

1149
01:28:01,975 --> 01:28:03,978
Moore pass the ball down to
Trish Sharkey...

1150
01:28:04,111 --> 01:28:06,583
Yes, yes, there we go.

1151
01:28:06,713 --> 01:28:07,781
Macs tie it up.

1152
01:28:07,914 --> 01:28:10,953
Westchester wastes no time
getting down the floor.

1153
01:28:11,585 --> 01:28:13,655
They shoot. And a foul.

1154
01:28:13,787 --> 01:28:15,089
Are you kidding me?

1155
01:28:16,089 --> 01:28:16,623
Come on!

1156
01:28:16,757 --> 01:28:19,128
Head Coach Rush doesn't like that.

1157
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:24,833
Westchester dribble, mings it,

1158
01:28:24,965 --> 01:28:27,804
Macs rotate to help,
there's Moore with a steal.

1159
01:28:27,934 --> 01:28:31,274
Passes the head,
Macs look to push over half court.

1160
01:28:31,405 --> 01:28:36,248
Exhibit... rainbow.
And a pot of gold.

1161
01:28:37,344 --> 01:28:39,381
The Macs tie it again.

1162
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,617
Westchester controls.

1163
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:44,385
Slide your feet...

1164
01:28:45,552 --> 01:28:46,921
Yes, stay right there.

1165
01:28:49,623 --> 01:28:52,228
Open jumper, she nails it.

1166
01:28:52,626 --> 01:28:54,863
Westchester leads by mo
in a minute

1167
01:28:54,995 --> 01:28:56,732
and a half left to go on the game.

1168
01:28:57,030 --> 01:29:00,404
Find Rosemay, Gail.
Find her. Search.

1169
01:29:02,569 --> 01:29:04,739
Jump shot. We're tied again.

1170
01:29:04,871 --> 01:29:06,107
There we go.

1171
01:29:07,441 --> 01:29:08,109
That's it.

1172
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:12,316
Macs with the ball, a chance to lead,
time's running down.

1173
01:29:15,716 --> 01:29:19,190
Sharkey, a jump shot,
and it drops through.

1174
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,057
Macs take the lead by mo.

1175
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:23,393
Thim five seconds to count.

1176
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:25,793
Westchester in ah...

1177
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:29,966
foul line, jumper.

1178
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:30,765
Good.

1179
01:29:30,897 --> 01:29:32,100
We are tied.

1180
01:29:32,766 --> 01:29:34,402
Sixteen seconds.

1181
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:36,104
Fourteen.

1182
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:37,838
Thirteen.

1183
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:41,877
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in.

1184
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:43,779
Time out, Cathy Rush.

1185
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:47,817
Jen, you're in. Okay, listen up.

1186
01:29:48,082 --> 01:29:50,052
We'll start fourteen low.

1187
01:29:50,617 --> 01:29:53,422
Rosemay, l want you to
hand off to Gail.

1188
01:29:53,787 --> 01:29:55,892
Trish, l want you to flash to the ball.

1189
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:57,592
They're going to be
overplaying with Jen.

1190
01:29:57,724 --> 01:30:00,296
l want you to set a back door screen.
All right.

1191
01:30:00,427 --> 01:30:02,832
You need to trust
that Trish will be there.

1192
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:04,499
Let's do this.

1193
01:30:05,032 --> 01:30:06,401
Be strong, Trishy.

1194
01:30:06,533 --> 01:30:08,570
-All right, on three.
-Ready?

1195
01:30:08,702 --> 01:30:12,042
One, mo, three, charge.
Come on, let's go.

1196
01:30:19,513 --> 01:30:24,456
Here we go, for evey team that
thought they never had a chance.

1197
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:31,627
Twelve seconds.

1198
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:33,627
Ten.

1199
01:30:34,996 --> 01:30:38,335
lmmaculata sets up along the baseline.

1200
01:30:42,536 --> 01:30:44,239
And now they motion.

1201
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:49,644
Five seconds.

1202
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:55,551
Sharkey lays it up.

1203
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:58,554
lt's good.

1204
01:30:59,153 --> 01:31:00,956
Yes, yes.

1205
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:06,432
lmmaculata College
has won the National Championship.

1206
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:09,766
The Mighh Macs are number one.

1207
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,368
Nice game.

1208
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,882
We did it, we did it.

1209
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:36,991
Congratulations, Coach.

1210
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:45,100
When l look back,

1211
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:50,308
l'm not sure any of us could explain
the mystey of how we won,

1212
01:31:50,439 --> 01:31:52,676
or why we won.

1213
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:55,712
But maybe,
all we did was look around us

1214
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:59,216
to see other women committed
to something they believed in.

1215
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:03,086
Somewhere along the way
you forget how important that is.

1216
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:05,422
As a team,
we must have learned from that,

1217
01:32:05,487 --> 01:32:06,655
because in the end,

1218
01:32:06,787 --> 01:32:10,728
it proved to all of us
that anything can happen

1219
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:12,895
when we're committed to our dreams.

1220
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,626
lmmaculata College survived
the turmoil of the early seventies.

1221
01:32:42,757 --> 01:32:47,533
ln 2005, it went co-ed and is
now thriving as Immaculata Universih.
