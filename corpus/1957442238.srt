1
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,709
What is it?

2
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,540
Three grand, cash, in my wallet.

3
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,639
Where is it?

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,310
How should I know?

5
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,459
Come here!

6
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,460
Where is it?

7
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,919
Now you, come over here!

8
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,449
No!

9
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,959
Take my stuff!

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,789
You bit...

11
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:09,680
Get over here!

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,510
Come here!

13
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,380
No!

14
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,210
Come here!

15
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:14,589
No wait, where you going, where you going?

16
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,089
Hey, whatever happened to
for richer or for poorer,

17
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,589
'til death do us part, huh?

18
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,689
Whatever happened to that, Katie, tell me.

19
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,399
What's mine is yours,
and what's yours is yours.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,210
You can't keep gambling away
everything I work for, Reese.

21
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:31,839
Since when do you tell me
what I can and cannot do?

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,779
Where is the money?

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,210
I don't know.

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,259
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

25
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,520
It's in our bank account!

26
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,919
Huh?

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,750
Huh?

28
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:53,189
What's wrong with
trying to save something?

29
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,020
Let me tell you something.

30
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,860
Don't you...

31
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,690
No, don't, please!

32
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:57,839
- Don't you ever...
- No!

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,029
Don't put that hand up, don't put it up!

34
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,700
Don't ever touch my money again.

35
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,160
I won't, I won't, I won't!

36
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,340
Hi, yeah, it's me.

37
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,389
Yeah, I checked it out.

38
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,039
Everything's gonna work fine.

39
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
Okay.

40
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,490
Hello.

41
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,740
Hey, Charlie.

42
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,229
It's Reese, how are you doing?

43
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,789
Fine, Reese, what's up?

44
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,859
Where you been?

45
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,269
Katie said you've been
gone a couple of days.

46
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,779
Yeah, I've been busy,

47
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,349
been doing a couple of
little business deals.

48
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,239
Listen, Charlie, we still
going hunting tomorrow?

49
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,999
Oh sure, if you want to.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,579
Oh yeah, I do, I'm
looking forward to it.

51
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,839
All right, look.

52
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,959
Be at the ranch around eight,
we'll get an early start.

53
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,540
All right, I'll see you then.

54
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Oh, oh.

55
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,550
Oh, oh.

56
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
You okay?

57
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,210
I'm fine.

58
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,180
That's not what I meant.

59
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,740
I know what you meant.

60
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,740
I'll be okay.

61
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,010
It's gonna be different,
Katie, I promise.

62
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,260
That's the last time.

63
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,759
There's no reason for
me to do that to you,

64
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,090
and I know that, so it stops, as of now.

65
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,680
I didn't mean to hurt you.

66
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,999
I just, you know,

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,170
sometimes my temper gets away from me.

68
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,500
I didn't mean to hurt you, I swear it.

69
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
I know.

70
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,470
Tell me you understand.

71
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,950
I understand.

72
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,100
Please, Katie.

73
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,400
I understand.

74
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,480
I've understood every time it's happened.

75
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,969
Charlie, you don't have to do this

76
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,219
if you don't want to, you know?

77
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,419
Oh no, no, that's okay.

78
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,749
The season's winding to a close anyway.

79
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,279
When Reese asked me to take him hunting,

80
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,839
it gave me an excuse to go.

81
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,809
Probably hit you up for money again.

82
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,469
Yeah, yeah well, he usually does.

83
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,799
Oh, the market's up, it's okay.

84
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,979
Hey Dad!

85
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,980
- Mom!
- Hey ya, Tiger!

86
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,980
Guess what?

87
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:37,799
- Guess what?
- What?

88
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,229
I'm gonna go to the
nursery with Aunt Kate

89
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,869
and help plant trees and things.

90
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,710
Oh yeah?

91
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,919
Well, don't you think
you'd better ask her first

92
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,429
to see if it's okay, huh?

93
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,529
- Grandma said it was.
- I did.

94
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,899
I didn't think she'd mind.

95
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,249
Well you ask her anyway,
she'll be here any minute, okay?

96
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,250
Okay.

97
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,479
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

98
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,059
Let's go over things.

99
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,559
I wanna make sure you know what to do.

100
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,150
Hey, I'm counting on you, Kate.

101
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,609
You've gotta act the part.

102
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,770
You can do it.

103
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,370
I know you can do it.

104
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,249
How am I gonna know you're okay?

105
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,429
Just watch the mail.

106
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,299
There's gonna be a
postcard with nothing on it

107
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,459
but a return post office
box number and a date.

108
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,599
That way you'll know I'm hiding,

109
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,440
and I'll send it as soon
as I think it's safe.

110
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:41,809
Come here.

111
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,440
I know you can.

112
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,650
I believe in you.

113
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,830
Okay.

114
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,969
- Okay.
- All right.

115
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,309
Let's go, come on.

116
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,980
You're okay, go, go.

117
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,659
Say!

118
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,689
Hiya, Reese.

119
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,499
Honey, what happened?

120
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,139
Nothing, it was a
branch, it was a branch.

121
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,140
Hi!

122
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,439
Bastard hit you again.

123
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,829
Don't say anything, don't spoil the day.

124
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,559
Hey, big fella!

125
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,319
Maybe we ought to take
you hunting with us.

126
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,539
You'd like that, wouldn't you, big fella?

127
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,619
I can't, I'm not old enough to hunt.

128
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,559
Good to see you, counselor.

129
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,469
Well maybe your Uncle
Reese ought to teach you.

130
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,649
How'd that be?

131
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,959
Ginny, that be all right?

132
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,809
Maybe some other time, Reese.

133
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,770
Joey, go get your stuff,

134
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:37,799
I'm gonna take you to the nursery.

135
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,909
Yeah, come on, Joey, let's go.

136
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,399
Hey Charlie,

137
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,209
hey, you think you're spending
enough time with the kid?

138
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,499
Sort of seems to me like he's
kinda missing a father figure.

139
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,430
What did you say?

140
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,270
Reese!

141
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:55,430
Oh, I was just
expressing an opinion, that's all.

142
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,220
I'll see you later, babe.

143
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:01,269
Okay, be careful.

144
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,930
Hey, not to worry!

145
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,419
There's extra ammo in
the saddlebags, gentlemen,

146
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,849
and water in the canteens.

147
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,999
Good man, Kenny.

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,159
Weather Channel's got high
winds on the bluffs later today

149
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,759
so be extra careful up there.

150
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,179
What a couple of old ladies.

151
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,039
Reese, Dokie gets spooked in high wind,

152
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,879
so be extra gentle with him up there.

153
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,879
Make sure and identify your target.

154
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,309
There's a lot of hunters out today.

155
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,900
Got it, I got it, let's ride.

156
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,489
Let me take a look at that eye again.

157
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,039
I'm fine.

158
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,239
Then why are you so nervous?

159
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,539
I'm not nervous!

160
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,299
You've got to do something about him.

161
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,149
You can't go on like this.

162
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,229
- Do what?
- Leave him!

163
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,150
Divorce him!

164
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,529
Get a restraining order
to keep him away from you!

165
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,509
I don't want a divorce!

166
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,789
I don't want your help, okay?

167
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,249
You've hated the idea of
me and Reese being together

168
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,939
from the very beginning.

169
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,309
You don't even like to see it, Ginny!

170
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,679
He is really going to
hurt you one of these day,

171
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,629
do you understand that?

172
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,689
It's not your business.

173
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,770
Not any more.

174
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,839
This is none of your
business either, Kenny.

175
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,920
Yes, ma'am.

176
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,209
Kenny, I'm going into
town, I have some work to do.

177
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,290
Yes, ma'am.

178
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,070
Come on, baby, come on!

179
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,569
Agh!

180
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,570
Damn!

181
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,569
I almost had that one.

182
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,599
You okay?

183
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,439
You seem a little uptight.

184
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,999
Yeah, Kate and me had a
little argument, that's all.

185
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,619
Yeah, I noticed.

186
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,579
What the hell is that?

187
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,799
First your wife, now you?

188
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,259
This is between Kate and me.

189
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,019
Oh, you're never gonna
convince Ginny of that.

190
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,239
I don't have to.

191
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,799
I'll tell you something else.

192
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,619
It's none of her business.

193
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,169
It's none of yours either.

194
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,749
Look, Reese, regardless of
what you think of my wife...

195
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,039
I think she's a nosy bitch.

196
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,589
I think she's jealous of her sister.

197
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,159
You just don't know when
to quit, do you, Reese?

198
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,109
Are you gonna teach me
when to quit, Charlie?

199
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,549
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna teach you

200
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,059
a little bit more than hunting.

201
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,940
How about right now?

202
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:08,479
I'm ready to learn, come on, come on.

203
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,449
You need counseling, buddy.

204
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,979
I'll tell you something, man.

205
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,569
I'm not the one that needs the counseling.

206
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,320
And I don't need you or your wife

207
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,410
to teach me how to treat Kate.

208
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,490
Hey!

209
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,290
Slow down!

210
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,410
Still no sign of a body?

211
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,169
So this is where you think he went off?

212
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,859
I don't know the exact
spot where he went over,

213
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,360
I didn't see that.

214
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,939
I saw him floating down
by the rocks, I saw him...

215
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,029
You don't know whether he was alive?

216
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,389
He was floating facedown.

217
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,659
Ginny!

218
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,490
Ginny, what happened?

219
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,959
Tell me he's okay,
please tell me he's okay!

220
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,559
Baby, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

221
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,899
Oh my God!

222
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,900
Oh my God!

223
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,669
Mrs. Williams, I'm sorry,
the divers are gonna keep at it

224
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,069
until it gets dark and tomorrow.

225
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,209
Listen, there is always a chance.

226
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,589
If they don't find a body,
there is always a chance!

227
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,590
Oh my God!

228
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,589
You and Mr. Williams came up here

229
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,499
to go hunting this
morning, is that correct?

230
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,689
I've got a license.

231
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,039
It's okay.

232
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,859
Did you hunt with Mr. Williams often?

233
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,899
No, no, this was his first time.

234
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,019
He called and said he wanted to learn.

235
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,279
So this was all his idea?

236
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,749
Yeah, yeah, he called,

237
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,629
said he'd been thinking
about taking up the sport,

238
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,279
wanted to give it a try, you know.

239
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,259
So I lined it up for today.

240
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,809
So if he was all new with this,

241
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,109
what was he doing riding on ahead of you?

242
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,689
We'd had a little disagreement.

243
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,819
He got angry and rode
off, I took off after him.

244
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,199
By the time I reached the spot, he...

245
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,209
Wanna tell me what
the argument was about?

246
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,039
I was offering some
brotherly advice, that's all.

247
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,030
He didn't wanna hear it.

248
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:10,329
Sergeant, my sister and her husband had

249
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,479
an argument last night.

250
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,959
It was nothing unusual,
nothing out of the ordinary.

251
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,939
Couples have arguments all the time.

252
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,579
Do you mind if I take my sister home?

253
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,580
Okay.

254
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,069
I'll call you if the situation changes.

255
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,070
Thank you.

256
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,030
Can I help you with something, sir?

257
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,399
What are you doing with that?

258
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,789
Cleaning it.

259
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,709
Why that one, it wasn't used.

260
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,040
Needed oiling.

261
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,439
Has it been fired recently?

262
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,838
No way to tell for sure.

263
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,760
Why don't you leave those two with me

264
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:11,759
and I'll clean them up as well.

265
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,599
Yes, yes, of course.

266
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,789
Something wrong, sir?

267
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,889
Well, there are going
to be a lot of questions,

268
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,328
an investigation, I just
don't want any loose ends.

269
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,539
Thought Mr. Williams fell?

270
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,049
He did.

271
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,819
What do the rifles
have to do with anything?

272
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,389
Mrs. Halloran may have
taken some ammunition

273
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,629
for target practice.

274
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,050
She didn't, I'd have known.

275
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,129
Hey Kate, what a surprise.

276
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,339
Hi, Ginny, Alice.

277
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,290
Hi, Kate.

278
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,089
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.

279
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,069
No, sit, we're just having coffee.

280
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,990
I wanted to talk to
you about a legal matter.

281
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,219
I can go back to the
office, no big deal.

282
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,399
No, I'd just as soon
you stay and take notes.

283
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,310
If it's a legal matter,

284
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:27,470
then we wanna make sure that
everything's done properly.

285
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,390
What's up, Kate?

286
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:30,399
Can I get you anything, ma'am?

287
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,489
Oh, coffee please.

288
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,990
I'll be right back.

289
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,649
This is a huge policy, I had no idea.

290
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,899
Reese took it out a couple of years ago

291
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,839
after he won big in Vegas.

292
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,449
He was in one of those
let's-take-care-of-Katie moods.

293
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,389
You'd need an official
determination of death

294
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,039
for the insurance company
to pay off on this.

295
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,069
I was hoping that you
would know what to do.

296
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,549
Well, I can orchestrate the procedures

297
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,619
and do all the paperwork, but
I can't guarantee the outcome.

298
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,120
Oh, I know that.

299
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,689
There'll be a full
investigation as to what happened.

300
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,859
Of course.

301
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,709
Um, do you know how long that takes?

302
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,540
Hard to say.

303
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,369
I'll move things along as fast as I can,

304
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,919
but only after there's
been a private hearing,

305
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,469
and everyone is satisfied
with the results,

306
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,899
will a judge issue a
determination of death ruling.

307
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,919
And then the insurance company will pay?

308
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,709
After the ruling, the
insurance company has no choice.

309
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,789
What do you think?

310
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,659
There's no body, but we
have a witness in Charlie,

311
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,449
who saw the body floating in the water.

312
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,759
Look, I'll do whatever I can, Kate.

313
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,180
Let me keep this,

314
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,299
and as soon as I get back to the office,

315
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,489
I'll take care of it.

316
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,889
Let's start a file.

317
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,839
We'll do a letter to Solar
State Life this afternoon,

318
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,119
requesting the process begin, okay?

319
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,040
I'll get right on it.

320
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,670
Thanks, Ginny.

321
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,049
Hey Kate, someone wants to see you.

322
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:16,880
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

323
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
Thanks.

324
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,239
You know, you haven't stopped
working for three hours.

325
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,989
There'll be nothing left
for the rest of us to do.

326
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,389
It just seems that the harder I work,

327
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,349
the less I think about things.

328
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,559
Yeah, I know it's been tough,

329
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,209
all the waiting, not knowing.

330
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,849
I keep expecting him to drive up.

331
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,809
I keep thinking that somehow
this is all a mistake.

332
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,819
He's gonna show up here

333
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,419
and pick me up at the end of the day.

334
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,219
Yeah, well work is
a tonic, but you know,

335
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,019
there's no use killing
yourself with it, is there?

336
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,269
I mean, no matter what
happens, you gotta keep going.

337
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,520
- Thanks, Martha.
- Sure, see you later.

338
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,239
Can I help you gentlemen?

339
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,379
Katherine Williams?

340
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,539
Investigators McCaffey and
Logan, with Solar State Life.

341
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,079
We're here about your husband's policy.

342
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,379
We're sorry about your
loss, Mrs. Williams.

343
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,039
Thank you.

344
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,559
Did you know about your
husband's policy, Kate?

345
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,299
Do you mind if I call you Kate?

346
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,589
Yes, I knew about the policy,

347
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,989
and no, I don't mind if you call me Kate.

348
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,820
Okay.

349
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:18,809
Reese told me about the
policy when he took it out.

350
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,769
Five million, that's a lot of money.

351
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,779
Especially for someone whose
income was less than steady.

352
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,489
Do you know how your
husband was able to afford

353
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,939
such a policy?

354
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,299
He bought it at a time
that he had a lot of cash,

355
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,789
and he prepaid the premiums.

356
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,969
Do you know where he got
the money to buy the policy?

357
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,659
I didn't ask him that.

358
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,439
Well, maybe it was after
a winning streak in Vegas?

359
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,280
Well, I guess you guys have found

360
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:42,649
a few things out already.

361
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,259
Well, it's not uncommon for someone

362
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,949
with a history of gambling
to take out a big policy.

363
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,929
I mean, sometimes they
feel that's insurance

364
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,679
against a losing streak.

365
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,149
His habits were well-documented

366
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,769
among the various casinos down there.

367
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,600
I see.

368
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:56,609
Were you aware that
he'd lost quite a bit

369
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,759
in the last few months?

370
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,379
I didn't keep tabs on it, no.

371
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,219
I'm afraid that it's true,
I mean he was deeply in debt.

372
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,259
I think it's even safe to say

373
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,639
that he might've been desperate for money.

374
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,599
What exactly are the
two of you trying to say?

375
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,679
It wouldn't be the first time

376
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,859
that someone tried to
stage their own death

377
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,829
to collect insurance money.

378
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,669
My brother-in-law saw Reese floating

379
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,719
facedown in the water.

380
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,309
We're not trying to imply anything,

381
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,079
or insult your husband's memory.

382
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,939
We have a job to do,
we're trying to do it.

383
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,219
Then do whatever you have to do,

384
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,379
but my husband is dead, and
work is about the only thing

385
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,029
that keeps me going these days,

386
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,030
so if you will excuse me, gentlemen.

387
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,919
Uh, Kate?

388
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,299
We might have to talk to you
again, would that be all right?

389
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,300
Of course.

390
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,839
We might have to talk to you again,

391
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,079
would that be all right?

392
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,029
When did you get so polite?

393
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,870
What are you talking about?

394
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,700
Back there?

395
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:53,049
Don't even say it!

396
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,679
I can read what's going on in
that little pea-brain of yours

397
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,559
like it was a neon sign
flashing on the Vegas strip.

398
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,859
Oh, is that so?

399
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,199
Yeah, that she's a good-looking babe,

400
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,159
that she makes the last date you had look

401
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,669
like a Boston terrier.

402
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,119
Boston terrier.

403
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,549
Oh, and
wouldn't it be a darn shame

404
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,889
if she was up to her neck
in something crooked?

405
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,729
And that's what I'm thinking, eh?

406
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,569
Oh, when you get to be
doing this long as I have,

407
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,209
young Master Logan, you
get to reading the signs.

408
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,210
Mmm.

409
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,649
You treat your girlfriends
as good as you do this car?

410
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,749
Well, you know, you take care of her,

411
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,539
she takes care of you.

412
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,209
Perfect relationship.

413
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,279
No wonder you don't have a girlfriend.

414
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,519
You know what I am thinking?

415
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,460
Huh?

416
00:24:36,461 --> 00:24:37,759
You're full of it.

417
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,260
Ah, the swami knew that too.

418
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,249
- Hey Mom?
- What?

419
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,090
Can I be done?

420
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:00,459
I wanna watch TV.

421
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,889
Okay, half an hour,

422
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,479
and then you do your homework, all right?

423
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,159
All right.

424
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,379
Hey Grandma, do you
wanna watch that new show

425
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,579
I was telling you about?

426
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,990
Oh, yeah, I'll catch up with you, okay?

427
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,219
I'd like to propose a toast.

428
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,669
To Katie.

429
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,459
Katie, you are in our hearts
and we pray for you every day.

430
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,919
May your world be one
of happiness and love,

431
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,579
from sunrise to sunrise, forever.

432
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,209
- Hear, hear!
- Cheers.

433
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,559
Better times ahead.

434
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,730
Thanks, Mom.

435
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,369
Two investigators from Solar
State Life Insurance came

436
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,879
to see me at the nursery today.

437
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,649
- How did it go?
- Okay.

438
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,629
Reese sure had a lot of
people fooled, didn't he?

439
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,490
Fooled how?

440
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:47,179
Well, a $5 million
life insurance policy?

441
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,449
Sure fooled me.

442
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,569
Kate, I hope you don't mind,

443
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,739
I told Charlie about the policy.

444
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,289
He bought it on a whim,

445
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,879
when he was flush with gambling money.

446
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,589
Oh yeah, but he could've
canceled that contract

447
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,099
at any time, assuming of
course that he remembered

448
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,399
that he had one, but I
don't see a guy like Reese

449
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,519
forgetting about five million bucks.

450
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,470
Why is it so hard to believe

451
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:07,919
that he kept that policy for me?

452
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,799
For my sake, in case something
like this ever did happen?

453
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,299
No offense, Katie, but it
just wasn't exactly his style.

454
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,969
He never gave a thought
to anybody but himself.

455
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,009
I have to go.

456
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,589
Why don't you stay here for tonight?

457
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,399
Don't go back to that
empty apartment, honey.

458
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,380
No, no, I'll be fine, Mom.

459
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:27,119
- Kate, you sure?
- Yeah.

460
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,069
You know, it's funny, because
the only honorable thing

461
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:34,619
that Reese ever did, to get
that insurance policy for me.

462
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,790
Now that he's dead, no one
wants to give him credit for it.

463
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,599
I was only asking the same questions

464
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,949
those investigator guys
are gonna be asking.

465
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,749
Charlie, you're the key witness.

466
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,229
You saw the body floating
facedown in the water.

467
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,079
I know and it makes me nervous.

468
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,910
They don't care what you think,

469
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,199
they don't care what I think!

470
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,549
They're only gonna be listening
to those insurance guys.

471
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:01,760
They're gonna be watching her
like a fox watches chickens.

472
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,759
I know what you're thinking.

473
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Do you?

474
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,100
No, I don't think you do.

475
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,900
Hmm.

476
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,300
I hated that bastard.

477
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,229
And you know, I think I
even hated myself more,

478
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,569
for not doing anything about it.

479
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,839
But there was nothing
any of us could do.

480
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,379
She was in love with him!

481
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,469
You, of all people,
should understand that.

482
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,959
But I know what he was doing to her!

483
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,979
I begged her to leave him.

484
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,759
Oh, Mom, anything, anything
to stop the beatings.

485
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,559
Yeah, but that wasn't
your responsibility!

486
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,159
Why not, she's my sister!

487
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,919
I owe her that, don't I?

488
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,299
I am so happy that you
girls are this close.

489
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,839
It's something that I wished for,

490
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,519
but Ginny, there is nothing you can do

491
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,109
to change what happened.

492
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,069
Katie's gonna have to go
through this on her own.

493
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,629
She'll survive it, and
then she'll come through it

494
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:12,559
and maybe, someday, find
someone else, God willing,

495
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,730
and all of this will just
seem like a bad memory to her.

496
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,450
Okay?

497
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,789
Okay.

498
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,790
Hey, you.

499
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,420
I have a date with Joey.

500
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,700
Oh, I love you both.

501
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,400
I love you too.

502
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,949
- Come here.
- Reese.

503
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,890
No.

504
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,720
I can't keep doing this.

505
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:07,039
Sh, sh, sh, look, you're my girl,

506
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,949
and nothing is gonna split us up.

507
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,779
Nothing, never, no.
Reese, please.

508
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,200
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

509
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,460
I've practiced this jump a dozen times.

510
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,569
How long until
we get to Yuma, boss?

511
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,849
Two days ride over those mountains.

512
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,399
You think we'll make it?

513
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,769
Don't know, bad storm,
Indian war parties,

514
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,229
rattlesnakes all ahead of us.

515
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,509
You're very good with
children, aren't you, Mr. Logan?

516
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,340
- Isn't he?
- Yes, he is.

517
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,989
I have a lot of nieces and nephews.

518
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,449
Oh, well you should
have kids of your own

519
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,739
because you have the magic.

520
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,259
You know, children know
when you mean them well

521
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,469
or mean them harm.

522
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:16,329
Um, we have to ask some
questions about your daughter

523
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,669
and the accident that
killed your son-in-law.

524
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,649
Oh yes, well I don't mind.

525
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,239
Kate said that she
came over here that day,

526
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,740
and that she was with Joey, all afternoon?

527
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,319
Yes, that's right.

528
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,249
Reese and Charlie had gone
hunting up at the bluff,

529
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,689
and she was going off to
the nursery for the day,

530
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:37,270
so I suggested that
she take Joey with her.

531
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,269
How's Joey reacting
to his uncle's accident?

532
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,729
Well, as I said, children
know when a person means them

533
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,820
well or means them harm
and he had a mean streak.

534
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,839
Of course it's none of
my business what happens

535
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,479
between a husband and wife.

536
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,729
No, that's right, no,

537
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,739
Kate and Joey were together
all afternoon, as I told you.

538
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,410
The whole afternoon.

539
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,919
I believe my daughter's
waiting to see you.

540
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,059
Oh thank you for your time.

541
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,230
Welcome, you're welcome.

542
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,239
Soup is getting thicker!

543
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,289
What?

544
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,739
All we did was confirm that the boy was

545
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,679
with her all afternoon.

546
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,859
Hold this.

547
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,559
Could be the old lady is
lying to protect her daughter.

548
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,429
You didn't notice how
Mama started to wriggle

549
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,679
after she dropped that nugget

550
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,689
about what a mean
so-and-so the deceased was?

551
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,689
If Kate had taken Joey
with her to the nursery,

552
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,719
then it should be fairly
easy, let me have that,

553
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,809
to find eyewitnesses who saw them there.

554
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,889
Well maybe.

555
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,129
The first thing I
learned in this business,

556
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,439
well, is that human beings
are capable of anything.

557
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,610
It doesn't have a damn thing
to do with how nice they look.

558
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,149
I don't know,

559
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,669
I just don't see this
woman committing murder

560
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,779
for the sake of insurance money.

561
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,280
Okay, you're probably right.

562
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,460
Then again, I've seen
stranger things than that.

563
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,339
All right, listen John,
why don't we split up?

564
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,709
You talk to the Hallorans
and I'll nose around out here

565
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,149
with the ranch hands.

566
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,389
I know they're expecting two of us,

567
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,220
but tell her I'm sick.

568
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,039
You don't wanna speak
with the Hallorans?

569
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,379
No, I read the transcripts.

570
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,130
Oh, well, maybe I'll
get them to loosen up.

571
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,410
I doubt it.

572
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,859
You don't think that I can interrogate

573
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,389
without you looking over my shoulder?

574
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,329
She's a lawyer, she
started the paperwork.

575
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,039
They're not gonna say anything

576
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,529
that could jeopardize her sister's chance

577
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,149
at the insurance money.

578
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,650
Well, we'll see.

579
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,620
20?

580
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,100
- You're on.
- Okay.

581
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,349
Mrs. Halloran, I'm from Solar State.

582
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,879
Oh yes, how do you do?

583
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,809
We were expecting you.

584
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,970
My husband will be joining us shortly.

585
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,169
- Please.
- Thank you.

586
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,659
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

587
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,709
So I understand that you
initiated the paperwork.

588
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,829
Yes, I did.

589
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,709
I would like to see it resolved
as quickly as possible.

590
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,289
My sister has been under
a considerable strain.

591
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,409
Now, is there anything
that you can tell us

592
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,660
about that day?

593
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,889
I saw Reese and Kate when she
dropped him off at the house

594
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,259
to go hunting with my husband.

595
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,879
Then she left and I went
into town to my office,

596
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,139
I had some work to do and
that's where I received the call

597
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,309
that there had been an accident.

598
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,399
Now, I would assume
there's someone downtown

599
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,779
that can verify that
you were at the office?

600
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,789
You make it sound like
a criminal investigation.

601
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,809
No, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to imply that.

602
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,140
No, it's okay.

603
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,169
We have a sign-in log at the building,

604
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,109
and if you need some character references,

605
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,709
I'm sure I could rustle up a few.

606
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,888
No, I'm
sure it'll be just fine.

607
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,519
Would you
care for some lemonade?

608
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,860
Sure, why not?

609
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,738
Do something for you, Mister?

610
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,239
My name's Mac, oh, McCaffey.

611
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,908
I'm an investigator with
Solar State Insurance Company.

612
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,549
You been working here long?

613
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,800
Couple years.

614
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,968
You knew the fella got
killed the other day?

615
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:58,519
Aye, nobody liked him much, did they?

616
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,069
I guess it was 'cause of
how he beat up on her.

617
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,469
Yeah, he shouldn't have done it.

618
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,269
I mean, I sure as hell
wouldn't treat her like that.

619
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,739
You like her?

620
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,740
Yeah sure, I like her.

621
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,460
What of it?

622
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,249
I'd bet you'd treat her a lot better

623
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,449
than Williams did, wouldn't you?

624
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,169
You think I had a
thing for her, don't you?

625
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,679
Give me a motive, wouldn't it?

626
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,680
Yeah.

627
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,620
No, she never looked my way.

628
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,279
But I watch things around here.

629
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,370
You know, pick things up.

630
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,489
Now something's bugging
you, isn't it, son?

631
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,339
Why don't you tell me about it?

632
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,929
It can't hurt.

633
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,739
Might even make you feel better.

634
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,139
I'm gonna find out all the
answers, sooner or later.

635
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,390
It's what I do.

636
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,770
Well, after they brought Dokie back,

637
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,419
Dokie's the horse Williams was riding,

638
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,539
I was putting up the saddle

639
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,189
and I couldn't find the
canteen I loaded up.

640
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,179
Now see, I fix everything
up for Mr. And Mrs. Halloran

641
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,109
when they go on a hunt,
so they don't have to do...

642
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,489
What, Mrs. Halloran hunts too?

643
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,679
Sometimes.

644
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,119
Hell, she's a better
shot than any of them.

645
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,859
Not that day, though,
said she had work to do.

646
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,780
Anyhow, there was no
canteen in the saddlebags.

647
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,639
Why is that significant?

648
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,390
You're the investigator,
you figure it out.

649
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,370
Right.

650
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,709
Ah, here he is.

651
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,130
Hiya, gorgeous.

652
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,719
Mr. Halloran, John
Logan, Solar State Life.

653
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,939
Mr. Logan.

654
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,699
I understand
that you were the one

655
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,999
who saw the body in the water?

656
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,169
Yeah, yeah, Reese
was wearing a tan vest,

657
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,809
so I could see him fairly clearly

658
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,119
from where I stood on the cliff.

659
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,939
And you said you saw
him floating facedown,

660
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,609
looking like he was dead?

661
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,979
Well, he looked dead to me.

662
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,399
But you never actually
saw him float away

663
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,169
or get carried away by the tide?

664
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,599
Well no, I had a choice to make.

665
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,979
I could stay there and
watch the body all day,

666
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,739
or I could go call for help.

667
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,679
You see, to do that, I
needed to go to the horse

668
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,739
and get the cellphone from the saddlebag

669
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,199
and those few minutes,
the body disappeared.

670
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,099
I think my husband
made the right decision,

671
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,609
don't you, Mr. Logan?

672
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,610
Yes, I do.

673
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:38,399
Now, you indicated that,
on the day of the accident,

674
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,169
you heard a gunshot.

675
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,449
There were hunters up on those bluffs,

676
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,769
we heard dozens of shots.

677
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,049
But you never actually
saw Mr. Williams fall?

678
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,030
Oh no, no.

679
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:48,969
You see, he raced on ahead of
me and by the time I got there

680
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:53,519
I saw his horse by itself
and I sensed something was up

681
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,139
and when I looked over the
edge I could see Reese's body

682
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,109
floating in the water below.

683
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,280
That's all I can tell you.

684
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,570
Hmm, okay.

685
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,410
That's it for me.

686
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,699
Thank you for talking to us.

687
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,789
Sure thing.

688
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,630
Thank you.

689
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,290
- Pleasure.
- Mm-hmm.

690
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,889
You have a nice day.

691
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,890
Thank you.

692
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,070
Us, what was he talking about?

693
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,359
What do you mean?

694
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,769
Well, he said, "Thank
you for talking to us."

695
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,850
So, who's us?

696
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,619
Well, his partner
wasn't feeling very well,

697
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,790
so he said that he would
wait for him out in the car.

698
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,720
- So?
- So what?

699
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,349
So, what did you learn
from the ranch hand?

700
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,529
Don't touch anything.

701
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,700
You might scratch the car.

702
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,639
One of the guys that I talked to was

703
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,810
a kid named Kenny Evering.

704
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,299
Now, he worked here a couple of years.

705
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,959
We gotta run a check on him.

706
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,379
Okay, and why are we running
a check on Kenny Evering?

707
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:24,089
'Cause he looked at me
funny as we were walking by.

708
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,760
That's scientific.

709
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,069
How did you fare with the Hallorans?

710
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,320
Learn anything new and hot?

711
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,859
All right, you win.

712
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,860
Thank you.

713
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:42,059
So what did we learn
about Kenny Evering?

714
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,209
Williams' canteen was missing

715
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,539
when they brought the horse back.

716
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,689
So, what does that tell you?

717
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,259
I mean, he went over the
cliff with the canteen.

718
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,529
Oh, if he's riding fast
on a precarious ledge,

719
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,279
why does he take out a canteen?

720
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,229
All right, he stopped and
he had a drink of water.

721
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,489
I mean, he got off the horse
with the canteen in his hand

722
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,709
and he fell over the cliff with it.

723
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,509
Well, if he's dismounted
and standing there,

724
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,269
then why does he fall?

725
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,369
Because he walks to
the edge of the cliff,

726
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:08,769
he's peering over and
he loses his footing.

727
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,159
Charlie says that they were only apart

728
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,359
for maybe a minute, two at the most.

729
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,200
So?

730
00:40:15,201 --> 00:40:17,189
Guy rides off in a huff, fuming,

731
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,649
then less than a minute
later, he's off his horse

732
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,059
taking a leisurely stroll
on the edge of the cliffs,

733
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,559
having a sip of water from his canteen.

734
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,509
Loses his balance?

735
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,539
Pfft, I don't think so.

736
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,469
But even if he did, wouldn't
he throw the canteen away

737
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,879
and grab for something to hold onto?

738
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,039
I would think so.

739
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,749
So if that happened,

740
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:44,289
then the canteen would be on
the ground somewhere nearby.

741
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,629
Only it ain't there!

742
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,999
No canteen!

743
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,990
And what does that tell you?

744
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,389
Nothing maybe.

745
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,559
Or maybe it tells me there's something

746
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,169
that doesn't smell quite
right about all of this.

747
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,340
There, clean as a whistle.

748
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,359
Joey asleep?

749
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,950
Sound asleep, Mom
too, in the same chair.

750
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,199
I didn't have the heart to wake her.

751
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,839
Don't wake her.

752
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,929
You know she loves falling
asleep in that chair.

753
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,100
Coming to bed?

754
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,549
You okay?

755
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,609
You seem preoccupied lately.

756
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:39,429
I was about to tell you
exactly the same thing.

757
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,600
Oh, it's this whole
business with Kate and Reese.

758
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,269
I think it's making us all a little crazy.

759
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,020
I'm glad he's dead.

760
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,559
God, what an awful thing to say,

761
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,889
but he was a miserable son of a bitch

762
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,140
that ruined a lot of lives.

763
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
Yeah.

764
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,469
You've been holding that one
in a long time, haven't you?

765
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,470
Yeah.

766
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,899
Do you think those insurance
investigators really believe

767
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,480
it was an accident?

768
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,419
Why shouldn't they believe you?

769
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,399
You said so yourself,
there were other hunters,

770
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,650
other gunshots.

771
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,769
What if it didn't happen exactly

772
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,519
the way I told the police that it did?

773
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,350
What are you saying?

774
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,589
It's that shot, Ginny.

775
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,579
I just keep hearing that shot over

776
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,740
and over again in my head.

777
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,130
- Ginny.
- What?

778
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,920
Nothing.

779
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,980
Come on, let's go to bed.

780
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:26,409
Mr. Logan, would you
like to come inside?

781
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,179
I can offer you something to drink.

782
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,079
There's no point in sitting
out here all by yourself.

783
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,369
Am I that noticeable?

784
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,989
Let's just say you are hard to miss.

785
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:37,830
Well, I'm kinda new at this job.

786
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:42,179
It's temporary actually.

787
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,629
Here, let me have that.

788
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:48,219
I'm gonna teach high school
music, I'm a musician.

789
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,009
But see, I needed money
and I saw this notice.

790
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,439
If you wanna teach music,
why don't you teach music?

791
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,459
That's what my friends say.

792
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,619
They said if you wanna play, play,

793
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,249
you wanna teach, teach.

794
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,699
They're right, if you have a
dream you ought to pursue it.

795
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,479
Oh yeah, well dreams
cost money, I got bills.

796
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,480
- There's that.
- Mm-hmm.

797
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,730
Oh wow, this is nice.

798
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,559
You have a terrific sense of style.

799
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,709
Thank you, my husband is...

800
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,849
Well, he was good with carpentry,

801
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,159
and I did all the
decorating and landscaping.

802
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,099
Oh, that's what you
do, isn't it, landscaping?

803
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,679
Yeah, I'm a landscape architect.

804
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,499
Can I offer you something
to drink, Mr. Logan?

805
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,199
You wanna beer or wine?

806
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,379
Oh, iced tea, if you have it.

807
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,489
I'm not supposed to drink on the job.

808
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,879
Well, you're not a cop, you
work for an insurance company.

809
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,839
Yeah well, the company has rules

810
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,069
and I sorta like to play by the rules.

811
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,070
Oh, that's refreshing.

812
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,210
- Here.
- Thank you.

813
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,699
My friends call me John.

814
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,079
Um, you're in my house because you

815
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,439
and your partner are trying
to prevent Solar State Life

816
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,369
from paying my husband's insurance policy,

817
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:10,709
so I don't think we qualify as friends.

818
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,909
Well, if there's nothing to prove,

819
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,659
then I'm sure that Solar State
Life would be more than happy

820
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,249
to make good on their obligations.

821
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,979
In fact, if there's no complications,

822
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,499
I'm here to ensure that they
pay off in a timely manner,

823
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,170
and I'd still love it
if you'd call me John.

824
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,419
Virginia.

825
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,379
I was going to come
by and see you, Judge.

826
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,949
How's your sister?

827
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,029
That was a terrible thing that happened.

828
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,069
Actually that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

829
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:47,900
Oh?

830
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:50,289
Her husband bought a huge policy

831
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,659
about six years ago, $5 million.

832
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,309
She's going to need a
determination of death ruling.

833
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,150
She's on her own now,

834
00:46:56,151 --> 00:46:58,269
she's going to need
every penny she can get.

835
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,029
So what would you like me to do?

836
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,979
Pick up the hearing off the docket?

837
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,549
Well, I need someone I can trust.

838
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,619
Obviously, Solar's going to
balk at that amount of money.

839
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,549
I can't say I blame them.

840
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,879
But you know I can't
influence the outcome.

841
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,809
Of course not, I'd
never ask you to do that.

842
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:13,650
I just wanna make sure

843
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:16,679
that Kate gets a fair shake, that's all.

844
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,069
I don't wanna see them drag
it on, week after week,

845
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,659
if there's no reason not to pay.

846
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,029
Well, okay, I'll have my clerk watch out

847
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,459
for the paperwork.

848
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,680
I enjoy keeping those
insurance boys honest.

849
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,509
Well, I'd better get back to my guests.

850
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,429
Always nice seeing you, Virginia.

851
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,409
Thank you, Eugene.

852
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:35,289
I really appreciate it, so will Kate.

853
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,729
You're welcome, bye-bye.

854
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,810
Bye-bye, Judge.

855
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,159
Did you ever go
hunting with everyone else?

856
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,779
No, they asked,
but I never wanted to.

857
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,829
Don't believe in
hunting for sport, huh?

858
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:56,129
No, it's nothing
so politically correct.

859
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:57,669
I was raised around guns.

860
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,939
You know my mom and dad
are career military?

861
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,589
And Ginny won a Junior
National Riflery Award

862
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,629
when she was a teenager.

863
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,079
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

864
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,959
She's an expert markswoman.

865
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,669
She won all these trips
to travel and compete

866
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,039
all over the place, Europe, everywhere.

867
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,079
God, I was as jealous as hell.

868
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,179
You don't strike me as someone

869
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,769
who would enjoy shooting guns.

870
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,179
I tell you, I would've shot anything,

871
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,749
if it meant the opportunity to travel.

872
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:25,409
I wanted to go to Rome and Venice,

873
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,469
you know, places like that?

874
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:30,409
I just never got the chance to do it.

875
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:35,389
$5 million would sure buy
a lot of airline tickets.

876
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,329
Is this a formal interrogation?

877
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:41,139
Or should I have legal
representation present?

878
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,810
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean anything by that.

879
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:58,149
I guess it's obvious I'm
kinda new at this job.

880
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:59,169
Yeah.

881
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,810
- It's really obvious!
- Yeah.

882
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:05,819
You don't really strike me as
the private investigator type.

883
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:10,489
You know what happened
is I answered this job ad,

884
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,439
and it sounded kind of romantic, you know,

885
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,770
like Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity.

886
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,669
You've never seen this movie?

887
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:20,859
- No.
- Oh, this is a great movie,

888
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,269
I've seen it about a million times.

889
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,319
Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck.

890
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,359
You see, Fred MacMurray plays this um,

891
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,369
private insurance investigator,

892
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:33,579
and he falls for this
sultry blond, Stanwyck,

893
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:37,750
and she's this gorgeous,
murdering widow, and she...

894
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,889
I'm sorry, I did it again, I'm sorry.

895
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,800
It's okay, it's okay.

896
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,720
It's getting kind of breezy.

897
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,660
Oh no.

898
00:49:50,661 --> 00:49:52,369
Come on, I insist, put it on.

899
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:53,370
Thanks.

900
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,769
Dust, dirt, grime from the city.

901
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:20,129
Gotta keep it off the finish
or it works its way in.

902
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,429
Where were you earlier?

903
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:24,889
Oh, I don't know, I was out
running around or something,

904
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,959
doing some errands, I'm sure of that.

905
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,309
Sand and saltwater also
causes damage out here.

906
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:34,059
You know anything about engines?

907
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,389
Yeah, my dad was a mechanic.

908
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:39,059
He said when I was 16, if I wanted a car,

909
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,829
I'd have to build it from spare parts.

910
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,939
Good for him!

911
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,629
I always had a squad car,

912
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:47,059
boys in the motor pool
always did the work.

913
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,799
Yeah, you were a cop?

914
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,800
15 years.

915
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,119
Well that would explain it then.

916
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,309
Explain what?

917
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,039
Why you're so good with this stuff.

918
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,789
Oh yeah, I'm great.

919
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,999
You never lose your nose for
the liars and the scumbags.

920
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Once you smell them, it
stays that way for life.

921
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,819
Why'd you stop being a cop?

922
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,549
Long story, morbid
nostalgia, I need food!

923
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,550
Food, food!

924
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:24,120
Hey, looky here, will you?

925
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,419
Check out these bank accounts.

926
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,139
Each one is in Reese Williams' name.

927
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,980
Three of them!

928
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,810
Really?

929
00:51:31,811 --> 00:51:33,529
And only one jointly with Kate.

930
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:36,699
So Mr. Williams was hiding
money from the little lady.

931
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,239
Our heroine seems to
instill secrecy in her men.

932
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,240
Okay.

933
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,979
Check out these deposits right here.

934
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,379
Where does a guy like this
get that kind of cash?

935
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,210
Is that gambling?

936
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,150
Well, it wouldn't be so regular,

937
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:51,369
this looks like a payment.

938
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:52,799
Hold this.

939
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,649
So this is like blackmail or extortion?

940
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:56,969
Could be.

941
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,899
You still think this guy
accidentally fell over a cliff?

942
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,119
Maybe not.

943
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,549
Hey, listen to this.

944
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:04,319
You know the stable boy, Kenny Evering?

945
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,709
He and Reese Williams got
into a fight three months ago

946
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,269
and Reese beat the hell out of this kid.

947
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:10,719
Oh, and Kenny knew where
they would be hunting.

948
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,089
He packs the horses, loads the weapons,

949
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,309
and keeps track of the ammo.

950
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:19,310
Ho, ho, somebody else
just arrived at the party!

951
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,819
You know what?

952
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:26,990
This is just like an Agatha
Christie novel, isn't it?

953
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,909
Hey there!

954
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:05,669
Is Kenny Evering around?

955
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:06,809
He was here a minute ago,

956
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,889
then he just all of a sudden
mounted up and took off.

957
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:10,569
Hm, you know where he's headed?

958
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,069
No, all I know is
he's supposed to be here

959
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:13,249
supervising this job.

960
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,589
Oh, when you see him,

961
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:16,609
tell him to call one of us, would you?

962
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,189
Number's on the card there.

963
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,659
Yeah well, next time you guys see him,

964
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:24,029
let him know that I could use
a little help around here.

965
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,309
I don't think it was a coincidence

966
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:28,480
somebody didn't wanna do much talking.

967
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,559
So did you know him personally, Colonel?

968
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,279
Oh yeah, as a matter of
fact I was on the trial board

969
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,799
at his court-martial.

970
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,189
Court-martial?

971
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:40,899
Yeah, he got a dishonorable discharge

972
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,409
and a six-month sentence for
beating the living daylights

973
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,699
out of a bunkmate.

974
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,189
And do you remember what happened?

975
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,790
Well, I'm retired, son, and that's...

976
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,789
It all started

977
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:54,419
when Williams got the general's
married daughter pregnant.

978
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,579
General's daughter?

979
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,499
Brigadier General Harmon McElvey.

980
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,039
He was the head honcho at the base

981
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,949
when Williams was stationed there.

982
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,949
You know, this goes back a few years.

983
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:06,339
General's dead now,
but he was a great man.

984
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,769
Harmon McElvey was a soldier's soldier,

985
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:11,409
straight as a rod, and he
did not like finding out

986
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,759
that his daughter was being
done on a regular basis

987
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,669
by one of his enlisted men,

988
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,819
while her husband was
on assignment in Europe.

989
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,439
So I would assume that
Williams was not well liked.

990
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,729
Not well liked?

991
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,169
Is this grass green?

992
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,779
Nobody had a good word to
say for the son of a bitch.

993
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:29,479
So what's that got to do
with beating a fellow soldier?

994
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,889
Williams was having the girl pay him

995
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:34,929
to keep things quiet while
he could arrange an abortion.

996
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:36,679
Only the bunkmate found out about it,

997
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,399
and blew the whistle on him.

998
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,089
Williams didn't take too kindly to it.

999
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:46,920
He beat the guy to within
an inch of his life.

1000
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:51,889
Uh, now, whatever happened to the girl?

1001
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,759
Messy divorce, then
she went to Switzerland

1002
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,389
'til things died down around here.

1003
00:54:56,390 --> 00:55:00,989
General McElvey made us
throw the book at Williams.

1004
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:03,779
Switzerland, isn't that
where they make cuckoo clocks?

1005
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,429
Come on, Kate's never
been to Switzerland,

1006
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,439
I'll bet anything.

1007
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,789
Kate, who's Kate?

1008
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:09,750
The general's daughter.

1009
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:10,899
Wrong daughter.

1010
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,070
Virginia, Virginia McElvey,
they called her Ginny.

1011
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,560
Sisters, their purple past revealed.

1012
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,889
Just kidding.

1013
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,810
Okay, let's track this.

1014
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:33,579
Williams figures that
he can romance his way

1015
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,879
up the ranks, huh?

1016
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,649
But he blows his first
chance when he gets greedy,

1017
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,659
so he figures the general's
pregnant daughter has gotta be

1018
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,359
worth some quick cash.

1019
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,439
Yeah, and maybe he needs the
money to cover his gambling,

1020
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,499
only his buddy blows the lid
off, and Williams winds up with

1021
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,989
no girl, no money, and
six months in the brig.

1022
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:56,569
And Ginny gets sent off to
Switzerland for a safe abortion

1023
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,359
and the McElveys, they
have to stay here and that,

1024
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,849
to keep things as quiet as possible.

1025
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,619
Until Williams returns and decides to go

1026
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,460
for double or nothing.

1027
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,610
- Whoa.
- What?

1028
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,579
There was no abortion!

1029
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,660
The boy belongs to Reese!

1030
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,250
- Joey?
- Yeah.

1031
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,919
Do you think Kate knows?

1032
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,199
I don't know, what do you think,

1033
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,499
you're the expert on all matters Kate.

1034
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,839
Knock it off, how am
I supposed to know that?

1035
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,699
Okay, look.

1036
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,969
The boy is a living reminder of everything

1037
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:29,039
that happened in the past.

1038
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,799
I'd say people might be lining
up to get back at this guy.

1039
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,499
Check this out.

1040
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,639
What's that?

1041
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,379
I found it in the bushes about 50 yards

1042
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,799
from where Williams supposedly
fell over the cliff.

1043
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,069
Now, a shotgun couldn't reach that far,

1044
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,679
but a .30-06, no problem.

1045
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,719
You can't prove anything with this!

1046
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,799
There's gotta be hundreds
of hunters up there!

1047
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,379
Somebody shot the guy, John!

1048
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,749
Oh, pfft.

1049
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,589
I can feel it, I can taste it!

1050
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:57,750
We're talking murder here!

1051
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,229
Where you been?

1052
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,089
I was checking out his hind leg,

1053
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,699
make sure it was healing properly.

1054
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,319
Those two insurance
investigators were here to see you.

1055
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,240
I didn't talk to them.

1056
00:57:09,241 --> 00:57:11,779
No, you took off when you
spotted them, I was watching.

1057
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,129
What's the matter, Kenny?

1058
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,379
Nothing, I didn't say anything.

1059
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,569
Look, it was kinda stupid to run,

1060
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:21,400
unless you have something to hide.

1061
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,439
I was looking out for
you and Mrs. Halloran.

1062
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,629
Kenny, Mrs. Halloran and
I appreciate your concern,

1063
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,639
but we don't want you running
from the investigators.

1064
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,829
Only makes things look a lot worse.

1065
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:34,349
They think somebody
pushed Reese off that cliff,

1066
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,249
maybe shot him off.

1067
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,369
They're only fishing for answers

1068
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:40,219
because they don't wanna
pay Kate what they owe her.

1069
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,189
Now, I know you had nothing to do with it,

1070
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:44,629
and that's the only thing that counts.

1071
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:45,630
Yes, sir.

1072
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:35,639
What's this?

1073
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,469
You planning a vacation, Mac?

1074
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:40,259
Oh, not me boy-o, your lady friend.

1075
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:42,009
Where'd you get this?

1076
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:44,839
Those are exact duplicates
of brochures discovered

1077
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,079
by a little professional snooping.

1078
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,489
What, you broke into her house?

1079
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:51,619
It's called investigating sir.

1080
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,209
The woman trusts me and
you broke into her house.

1081
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,199
What if she had come back?

1082
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,639
I've done this a few times, you know.

1083
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,749
You've been following us!

1084
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,859
You don't get it, do you, boy-o?

1085
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,539
This sweet young thing just
might've killed her husband

1086
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,899
for the insurance money.

1087
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:06,740
No.

1088
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:08,899
It's happened before you know,
and not just in the movies!

1089
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,529
And you're acting like you
two are going to some prom!

1090
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:13,099
Mac, Mac, you don't know her.

1091
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,109
I know what these brochures tell me.

1092
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,659
I know that she's not planning
on sticking around here

1093
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,069
once she's got our company's money

1094
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:20,629
in her delicate little hands!

1095
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,259
Well, maybe she's
planning a trip, you know?

1096
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:26,430
Maybe she wants to get away,
forget her troubles, you know?

1097
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:29,779
No law against that, least
the last time I looked.

1098
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,909
Will you listen to yourself?

1099
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:34,129
You sound like a little puppy dog!

1100
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,729
I'm trying to keep you from
following Reese Williams

1101
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:40,099
over that same little cliff!

1102
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:44,270
Well, thank you very much,
Mac, I can take care of myself.

1103
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,929
I can't believe
you came all the way up here

1104
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:55,039
just to lug these things around.

1105
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,079
These things weigh a ton!

1106
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,989
If I were you, I'd take advantage
of the fact that I'm here.

1107
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,990
Well, I can't pay you.

1108
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,449
Wait a second.

1109
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,969
That's my card.

1110
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:10,949
I owe you one free dinner,
that's payment enough.

1111
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,789
So how'd you get into landscaping?

1112
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,859
Oh, while Ginny was off
winning those riflery awards,

1113
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,829
I was wandering around
the post making friends

1114
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:20,189
with the landscaping crews.

1115
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:22,349
I became sort of like their mascot.

1116
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,649
Oh yeah?

1117
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,560
So, did you know Reese?

1118
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,760
Yeah.

1119
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:31,649
He was dating Ginny at the time.

1120
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:34,529
Did you know about the two of them?

1121
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:36,259
I know all about them.

1122
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:40,109
I know about the court-martial, and Joey.

1123
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,629
What, are you looking for motives?

1124
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:43,149
No, no, I'm just,

1125
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:46,879
I'm trying to figure out how
someone like you would end up

1126
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,880
with someone like Reese.

1127
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:54,720
Psychologists would say
that it was sibling rivalry.

1128
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,839
I was jealous of Ginny

1129
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,699
and I wanted what she
could no longer have.

1130
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,279
Would the psychologists be right?

1131
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,360
To a degree, I suppose.

1132
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:08,939
But there was a time when
Reese and I were happy,

1133
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,639
you know, we were fixing up our house

1134
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,129
and making plans for the future.

1135
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:18,489
He was a different person then,

1136
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:20,070
and that was be...

1137
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:26,609
Anyway, do you have
everything that you need

1138
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,579
or is there something else
that you'd like to ask me?

1139
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:32,330
Well, I'd like to
think that we're friends.

1140
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,800
Reese's death, the
insurance policy, your job,

1141
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:43,779
none of those things are gonna go away

1142
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,659
until after this investigation is over,

1143
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,410
one way or the other.

1144
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,719
There are all kinds of
questions in your head.

1145
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,880
I can hear them, I can feel
them every time you look at me.

1146
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,069
Reese, what are you doing here?

1147
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,190
Tell me, you little bitch!

1148
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,199
You think I don't know what's going on?

1149
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,609
Reese, I've been
waiting to hear from you.

1150
01:03:58,610 --> 01:03:59,749
I've been checking the mail every day.

1151
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,339
You think I don't know
what's been going on?

1152
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,230
You tried to double-cross me!

1153
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:07,049
No you don't!

1154
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,119
You tried to shoot me,

1155
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,929
and I've got the bullet in
my shoulder to prove it!

1156
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:11,930
Come here!

1157
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,939
You passed out
in the kitchen last night.

1158
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,849
Why didn't you just finish me off?

1159
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:39,979
You have to get this shoulder treated.

1160
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,179
I'm supposed to be dead, remember,

1161
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:43,609
I can't very well show up
at some doctor's office.

1162
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,439
Forget about the money, Reese.

1163
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,679
You're badly wounded.

1164
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,309
We're not forgetting about anything.

1165
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:50,779
Everybody thinks I'm dead and
we're gonna keep it that way,

1166
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:51,650
do you understand?

1167
01:04:51,651 --> 01:04:53,829
It's gonna be true if
that wound gets infected.

1168
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:55,109
I'm not gonna die from it.

1169
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,989
I survived the shot and the fall,

1170
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:58,219
I've been living out in the woods for days

1171
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:00,119
with this damn thing in me.

1172
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,959
We're too close to quit now.

1173
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,689
You're gonna take this bullet out of me.

1174
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:07,409
Reese, I can't do that,
I'm not a doctor, I can't...

1175
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:09,699
I'll make you a list of supplies.

1176
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:13,860
I know what to do, I've
trained for this, remember?

1177
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:17,249
You can do it, Katie.

1178
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:18,580
You can do this.

1179
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,329
You could've killed me.

1180
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:32,060
When I passed out, you had the chance.

1181
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,140
I'll be goddamned!

1182
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:39,559
She set me up.

1183
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,289
Who?

1184
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:42,999
Whose idea you think this
whole insurance scam was

1185
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,910
in the first place?

1186
01:05:43,911 --> 01:05:46,059
What do I know about legal rulings?

1187
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:48,679
This was Ginny's idea from the get-go.

1188
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,709
The bitch double-crossed me.

1189
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:53,359
I don't believe you.

1190
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,629
Nobody else knew what
I was gonna be doing

1191
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:55,989
on that cliff that day.

1192
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:57,369
Nobody but the three of us,

1193
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,870
you, me, and that lady lawyer.

1194
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:02,929
If you want me to take that bullet out,

1195
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:04,319
then I have to go get supplies.

1196
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,609
Hey, I was near death out there,

1197
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:08,639
using every trick I knew to survive,

1198
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,819
and the only thought on my
mind was about the money

1199
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:16,980
and the fact that you or your
sister double-crossed me.

1200
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:23,559
You try anything, you
say anything to anybody,

1201
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:27,480
you do anything, and I
swear, I will kill Joey.

1202
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,150
I'll be back.

1203
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:36,810
I'll be back.

1204
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:56,909
- Ginny!
- Kate!

1205
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:57,939
What are you doing here?

1206
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,209
What the hell is going on?

1207
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,040
What are you talking about?

1208
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:01,459
I'm talking about Reese.

1209
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,300
What about Reese?

1210
01:07:02,301 --> 01:07:04,589
He showed up last night,
how do you think I got this?

1211
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,619
I was sitting down to work,
and the next thing I know,

1212
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,639
Reese is there, and he's
slamming me around the room

1213
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,359
and he wants to know why
I double-crossed him,

1214
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,779
why I tried to kill him.

1215
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:12,700
What are you talking about?

1216
01:07:12,701 --> 01:07:14,039
He thinks that you shot him, Ginny!

1217
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,109
He's going on and on about it.

1218
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:15,990
That I shot him?

1219
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:16,940
It's a miracle that he survived,

1220
01:07:16,941 --> 01:07:18,989
now what the hell is going on?

1221
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:21,539
Kate, listen to me.

1222
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:22,649
Don't let him do this to us,

1223
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:25,159
don't let him turn us against one another.

1224
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,279
Ginny, why did you shoot him?

1225
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,110
Why didn't you tell me?

1226
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:29,309
Kate, I did not shoot
him, I did not shoot him,

1227
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:31,809
you've got to believe me.

1228
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:33,689
So what happens now?

1229
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,949
Give me a minute to think.

1230
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:36,950
Hi, Kate.

1231
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:38,999
Everything all right today?

1232
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,109
Yeah, fine.

1233
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:42,179
See you tomorrow, Alice.

1234
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,260
Bye.

1235
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:45,770
Oh, God.

1236
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:50,170
Look, I will try to
accelerate the process,

1237
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,939
maybe get a ruling in a week or two,

1238
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:55,069
but you've got to keep Reese out of sight.

1239
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,489
Reese will stay quiet.

1240
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,579
He wants the money, he'll do
anything he has to to get it.

1241
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:00,959
Oh, Kate.

1242
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,960
Thanks.

1243
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,159
All I know is there's a
whole truckload of people

1244
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,909
who wanted to have this guy dead,

1245
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:13,909
starting with his wife,
whom he beat the hell out of

1246
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:15,169
on a regular basis.

1247
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,888
She didn't do it, Mac.

1248
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:19,179
Okay, you know, have it your way, eh?

1249
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,629
What about his sister-in-law, Ginny?

1250
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,669
Old news, why kill him now?

1251
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:25,089
Well, stuff like this is never old news.

1252
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:27,439
She sees it every time
she looks at her son

1253
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,228
or her new husband.

1254
01:08:29,229 --> 01:08:31,629
She knew about the hunt.

1255
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:34,919
She waits for the right
moment, blam, past eradicated!

1256
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,329
Okay, the problem is
her office building is

1257
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:39,638
a county facility with a sign-in sheet.

1258
01:08:39,639 --> 01:08:42,079
There's a 24/7 security guard out front.

1259
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,920
He signs her in, he signs her out.

1260
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:50,110
Okay, suppose Charlie
Halloran decides to take matters

1261
01:08:51,059 --> 01:08:53,138
into his own hands, huh?

1262
01:08:53,139 --> 01:08:53,969
All right.

1263
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,259
I mean he hates the guy
because of what he did

1264
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:59,749
to Ginny and Kate, so they're
up all alone on the cliffs,

1265
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:01,978
one quick shot, it's all over.

1266
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:05,839
And just swing it away
from the family tree,

1267
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,039
what about Kenny?

1268
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,710
But how do you prove all this?

1269
01:09:13,389 --> 01:09:15,839
I'll keep working on the Hallorans,

1270
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:19,699
and you keep wining and
dining the merry widow.

1271
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,609
Oh no, I'm not gonna do that.

1272
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:23,159
What do you mean you won't?

1273
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:23,990
Because I'm not gonna do it,

1274
01:09:23,991 --> 01:09:25,779
I'm not gonna lie and
deceive Kate like that.

1275
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:28,129
It won't happen, period.

1276
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,130
Fine!

1277
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:32,709
Go have a good time!

1278
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,869
You know, read poetry to
her in the shade of a tree,

1279
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:37,558
but the truth is gonna come out one day

1280
01:09:37,559 --> 01:09:40,889
and bite you whether you like it or not.

1281
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,699
You talk to your sister?

1282
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,709
She says she
didn't try and shoot you.

1283
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:52,898
She's lying!

1284
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:55,119
You were taking money from
them again, weren't you?

1285
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:59,279
I had some heavy debts
so I asked for help.

1286
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,509
Hell, that's what family's for, right?

1287
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:04,779
Sit up, she says you threatened
to tell Joey the truth.

1288
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:07,519
He's my kid, I got every
right to tell him who I am.

1289
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,138
She's bitter, she's
jealous because I wound up

1290
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:12,409
with you and not with her.

1291
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:14,638
He's a little boy, Reese, it's not fair.

1292
01:10:14,639 --> 01:10:16,789
He has a chance for a
normal life with them.

1293
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:18,599
What, no, I wasn't
really gonna tell him.

1294
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,189
That was part of the deal that she came up

1295
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:21,429
with the insurance scam.

1296
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,239
I was gonna take the money
and keep my mouth shut,

1297
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,919
and I agreed, I agreed, I agreed.

1298
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:26,760
And now?

1299
01:10:26,761 --> 01:10:28,499
She tried to kill me,
Kate, don't take her side.

1300
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,319
You think she cares about you?

1301
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,808
She has lorded it over us
ever since we were married.

1302
01:10:33,809 --> 01:10:36,468
She's got the ranch,
she's got the position,

1303
01:10:36,469 --> 01:10:38,849
she's got the rich husband,
but she didn't get me,

1304
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:40,879
and she's never gonna
forgive you for that, Kate.

1305
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,699
You think she tried to
kill you because of that?

1306
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,299
She knew exactly where
I was gonna be, and when,

1307
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,529
and she's a crack shot.

1308
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:48,429
I'll tell you something,
I gotta message for her.

1309
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:50,609
She's gonna get that ruling
and she's gonna get that money

1310
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:52,999
or she's gonna be even
sorrier than she is now

1311
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
that I survived.

1312
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:01,780
- Hello?
- Hello.

1313
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:04,979
- Hi.
- Hey, you owe me dinner.

1314
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:06,049
I thought maybe I'd come by tonight

1315
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:08,609
and collect on an IOU.

1316
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:09,450
Tonight's not good,

1317
01:11:09,451 --> 01:11:11,009
I'm working on some landscaping drawings,

1318
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:12,229
I'm gonna be working late.

1319
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,829
How about tomorrow night?

1320
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:15,039
I don't know.

1321
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,659
Are you blowing me off here?

1322
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:17,630
You mean to tell me I came by

1323
01:11:17,631 --> 01:11:20,308
and lifted all those
heavy pots for nothing?

1324
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,949
Why don't you give me a phone
number where I can reach you

1325
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:26,479
and then I'll call you
when I can get away.

1326
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,559
Okay, thanks.

1327
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,830
Someone from the nursery.

1328
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,049
You've changed, Katie.

1329
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:36,319
What are you talking about?

1330
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,670
I don't know, you're different, you're...

1331
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:45,468
More sure of yourself.

1332
01:11:45,469 --> 01:11:48,969
Grit your teeth or something
because I'm gonna start.

1333
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,859
Wow!

1334
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:56,859
Very impressive.

1335
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:59,199
This is better than any
restaurant I had in mind.

1336
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,649
Che Kate.

1337
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:01,990
Hey, terrific.

1338
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:05,150
- Mm, may I?
- Yeah.

1339
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:08,209
How did you...

1340
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:10,699
Oh, occupational hazard.

1341
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:13,479
It was a swinging branch of
a northern California fir.

1342
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,480
Oh, Kate.

1343
01:13:14,481 --> 01:13:15,968
No, it's fine.

1344
01:13:15,969 --> 01:13:19,199
Come on, dinner's getting cold.

1345
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,959
Okay, no more questions.

1346
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,650
- All right?
- Yeah.

1347
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:27,110
And he said play this, do it!

1348
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:33,109
I said no, he said,
well if you do it again,

1349
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:34,719
you're out of the band forever.

1350
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:46,930
You're staring at me.

1351
01:13:48,059 --> 01:13:50,279
Don't you believe
that two people can just

1352
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,129
know each other instinctively?

1353
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,499
That's sweet,

1354
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,899
but I think that things
don't always work out

1355
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,439
the way you want them to.

1356
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,959
Well maybe you just don't
trust your feelings, is all.

1357
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:04,739
I don't have a lot of practice
in trusting my feelings.

1358
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:09,369
I've been too busy trying not
to get my face smashed in.

1359
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:11,019
It wouldn't take too much investigation

1360
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:15,179
to figure out want our marriage was like.

1361
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:18,459
I'm sorry, we don't have to go there.

1362
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:22,630
No, I don't mind talking
about it, I wanna talk about it.

1363
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:27,240
I feel like my life is changing so fast.

1364
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:32,119
I don't care about the money, John.

1365
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,009
I really don't.

1366
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:37,839
I just want a chance to start my life over

1367
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,049
and not have to be afraid
of being hurt again.

1368
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:43,050
Can you understand that?

1369
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:46,320
- Oh, no, no.
- What?

1370
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:54,880
Mac says that I can't
discuss the evidence with you.

1371
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,888
What, am I a suspect?

1372
01:14:57,889 --> 01:14:59,529
I mean, what am I suspected of?

1373
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:02,200
He found a shell from a .30-06

1374
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:05,909
near the spot where Reese fell.

1375
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:07,218
They were hunting.

1376
01:15:07,219 --> 01:15:10,119
But he found it in a grove of bushes

1377
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,729
with a perfect vantage point.

1378
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:13,539
You think Reese was shot?

1379
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:14,888
I don't know what I think,

1380
01:15:14,889 --> 01:15:17,769
but Mac thinks that he
was shot and killed, yes.

1381
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:18,959
He thinks I did it, doesn't he?

1382
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,669
Oh no, no, no, not necessarily.

1383
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:23,759
He said there were plenty of
other suspects with motives.

1384
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,079
No, no, just ask the question, okay,

1385
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,589
because it's hanging over your head.

1386
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:31,779
Let's just get this over
with, just ask the question.

1387
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:33,759
That's not necessary,
I don't have to ask.

1388
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,468
I told you, I was raised around guns,

1389
01:15:36,469 --> 01:15:40,239
and I can fire a hunting rifle
as well as any man I know,

1390
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,849
but I did not shoot my husband,

1391
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:45,359
and I did not kill my husband.

1392
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,649
Now you need to ask yourself
what you really believe,

1393
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:52,709
because if you don't believe
that I'm telling you the truth

1394
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:54,669
then you should turn
and walk out of my life

1395
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:57,670
and don't even think of coming back.

1396
01:16:40,059 --> 01:16:41,059
Katie?

1397
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Kate?

1398
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,200
Baby?

1399
01:16:57,139 --> 01:16:58,219
You out here?

1400
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:06,400
Who's out here?

1401
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,020
Katie?

1402
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,570
She had to go out.

1403
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:21,409
Where is she?

1404
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:22,660
I don't know.

1405
01:17:23,559 --> 01:17:25,399
You're lying.

1406
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,029
I heard her making plans on the telephone

1407
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:28,388
earlier this afternoon.

1408
01:17:28,389 --> 01:17:29,389
She's not wasting any time

1409
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:32,309
playing the grieving widow, is she?

1410
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,659
Why'd you double-cross me, Ginny?

1411
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:36,500
I didn't.

1412
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:38,189
Pfft, somebody shot me,

1413
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:40,819
this shoulder isn't the
result of a hunting accident.

1414
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:45,019
Ha, trust me, Reese, if it had been me,

1415
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,539
you wouldn't be standing here right now.

1416
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:49,759
I carried out my part of the bargain.

1417
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,138
If I get the ruling, you've
gotta carry out yours.

1418
01:17:52,139 --> 01:17:54,329
You take your share and you leave forever.

1419
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:55,160
What's the matter, counselor,

1420
01:17:55,161 --> 01:17:56,629
don't you think I'm a man of my word?

1421
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,509
I'd have been happy with
my share, I'd have left.

1422
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:00,659
Somebody else didn't stick to the plan.

1423
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,779
Kate will wire half the money,

1424
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:05,049
to a numbered account in the Bahamas.

1425
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:07,419
Reese, if you go back on
your word in any way, shape,

1426
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:09,519
or form, I'll go to the authorities

1427
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,558
and I will tell them
exactly where to find you.

1428
01:18:11,559 --> 01:18:13,589
No, you won't do that.

1429
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:17,680
Believe me, I don't care
what happens any more.

1430
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,160
Oh, looks like I'm not in
any position to bargain, am I?

1431
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:26,420
I guess not.

1432
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:31,559
Looks like you won this one.

1433
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:39,638
Still the same magic
between us, huh, Virginia?

1434
01:18:39,639 --> 01:18:41,619
You son of a bitch!

1435
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:43,979
I wish to God you had died!

1436
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:46,809
And leave Joey without a father?

1437
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:02,749
Ginny, what's wrong?

1438
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:04,019
He's crazy.

1439
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:06,239
He thinks we're conspiring against him.

1440
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,799
They found a .30-06 shell,

1441
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,229
right near the spot where he fell,

1442
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:11,829
and now they suspect that he was shot.

1443
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:14,739
I don't think that they can
prove anything but I'm worried.

1444
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:17,119
This whole thing is
threatening to unravel.

1445
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,379
Ginny, he said that if
we tell the authorities,

1446
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,710
he'll kill Joey.

1447
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:25,559
We've got to finish this now.

1448
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:28,459
Kate, I think Charlie shot him.

1449
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,300
Charlie?

1450
01:19:29,301 --> 01:19:30,759
He's been saying things.

1451
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,449
He's been leading me with
questions, I don't know.

1452
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:38,099
Somebody shot him, it
wasn't you, it wasn't me.

1453
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,449
Kate, I gotta know.

1454
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:41,450
I know.

1455
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:50,210
Hi.

1456
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,049
Missed you at dinner.

1457
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:54,319
How's Katie?

1458
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,740
Oh, she's okay.

1459
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:59,419
Still a little needy, she wanted to talk,

1460
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,419
we lost track of time, I'm sorry.

1461
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:03,759
It's no problem.

1462
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,930
Joey and I went to the mall,
had some burgers and fries.

1463
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:10,420
- Charlie?
- Hm?

1464
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:14,029
The other night you told me

1465
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:16,860
that you kept hearing the gunshot,

1466
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:22,839
and that you weren't
sure that what happened

1467
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,129
was what you said.

1468
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:26,219
I remember.

1469
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:29,600
You were trying to tell
me something, weren't you?

1470
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:36,080
Joey and I are very close.

1471
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:40,519
He's the son I've always wanted.

1472
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,879
And I know that Reese was
threatening to tell him

1473
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,709
that he was his real birth father,

1474
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:47,929
and I know that you were not
going to allow him to do that.

1475
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:50,789
Ginny, when I heard the
shot, I just assumed

1476
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:54,290
that you took matters into your own hands.

1477
01:20:58,889 --> 01:20:59,889
Me?

1478
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:02,859
You're afraid that I shot him?

1479
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:03,860
Well, yes.

1480
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:09,190
Charlie, I didn't, I swear it.

1481
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:14,019
I was going to confront you,
I thought that you did it.

1482
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,369
- Me?
- Yes, to protect me.

1483
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,280
I mean, oh, this is so crazy, I...

1484
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:21,569
You really didn't?

1485
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:22,570
No, me?

1486
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:27,940
I hated the son of a bitch but
I'm not gonna shoot anybody.

1487
01:21:35,389 --> 01:21:36,980
If you didn't...

1488
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,550
Kenny!

1489
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:40,490
Kenny?

1490
01:21:40,491 --> 01:21:42,529
Well sure, you know how he liked Katie,

1491
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:43,929
and when those insurance
investigators came

1492
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:45,179
to question him he bolted.

1493
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:46,308
He told me that he was afraid

1494
01:21:46,309 --> 01:21:47,779
that he was gonna say something

1495
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:50,468
that might incriminate one of us.

1496
01:21:50,469 --> 01:21:52,819
I just assumed he was talking about you.

1497
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:56,829
Of course, he was trying
to protect himself.

1498
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:59,489
Maybe we should talk to him.

1499
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:01,820
In the morning, my beauty.

1500
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:06,790
In the morning.

1501
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,339
You're late!

1502
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:19,829
We're not due in the judge's
chambers for another hour.

1503
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:21,619
We ought to go over this stuff again.

1504
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:22,450
Why?

1505
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:23,290
So we know what we're doing.

1506
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:24,240
I know what I'm doing.

1507
01:22:24,241 --> 01:22:25,320
John, John.

1508
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,959
I need you in there today.

1509
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,179
How the hell am I gonna
get the judge to listen

1510
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:33,249
if you and I aren't singing the same song?

1511
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:35,279
I got nothing to say, Mac.

1512
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,979
Do you work for this company?

1513
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:39,968
Our job is to take these
findings and convince the judge

1514
01:22:39,969 --> 01:22:43,569
that a determination of
death ruling is not in order.

1515
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:45,119
I'm not gonna walk in
there and accuse these people

1516
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,399
of murder, when we don't
have any hard evidence.

1517
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,789
We're not the cops,
we're not accusing anyone!

1518
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:52,209
We're just trying to
establish enough doubt

1519
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:54,269
to keep the investigation going!

1520
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:56,669
I know what our job is, Mac!

1521
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:58,439
We're supposed to keep Solar State Life

1522
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,229
from paying off on the insurance policy!

1523
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:02,089
Well, I'm gonna do exactly the opposite!

1524
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:05,119
You're never gonna
make it in this company.

1525
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,569
You don't get it, do you?

1526
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:11,740
I could never live with
myself if I did that to Kate.

1527
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,570
Hiyah!

1528
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:26,739
Billy, have you seen Kenny anywhere?

1529
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,859
No sir, not since
this morning about six.

1530
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:30,019
He was packing up his stuff.

1531
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:31,919
- Packing?
- Yes, ma'am.

1532
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,299
He said there was too much
heat on him around here,

1533
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,879
so he was taking off.

1534
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,579
He said you two knew about
it, so you'd understand.

1535
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,669
Yeah, thanks, Billy.

1536
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:41,250
- Thank you.
- Sure, no problem.

1537
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:50,699
Mr. McCaffey, I have
reviewed your theories,

1538
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:53,468
and your conjectures, and I must admit

1539
01:23:53,469 --> 01:23:55,999
that they made for very
interesting reading.

1540
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,468
Then again, so does John Grisham.

1541
01:23:58,469 --> 01:24:01,539
His books, however, are works of fiction,

1542
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:05,869
and I believe that your
theories are equally fanciful.

1543
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:08,149
Fortunately or unfortunately,

1544
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:12,309
these postulations are supported
by no substantial evidence,

1545
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,259
nothing other than the
most circumstantial.

1546
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,869
What we do know for sure
is that Mr. Williams went

1547
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:21,539
from up on the cliff down to the water,

1548
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:24,269
facedown according to
our single eyewitness,

1549
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:27,329
and beyond that, there is
no indication of foul play

1550
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:31,079
or untoward behavior on the
part of anyone involved.

1551
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,779
I might add parenthetically,
I know the family involved

1552
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:37,689
and can therefore bring
a personal judgment

1553
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:41,279
as to the character of
those giving testimony.

1554
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,769
Your Honor, I would like
to lodge a formal protest

1555
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:46,349
on behalf of the Solar State
Life Insurance Company.

1556
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:49,689
Mr. McCaffey, you may
lodge any protest you wish,

1557
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:53,808
however, it is my ruling that
the determination of death

1558
01:24:53,809 --> 01:24:57,369
in this case, is consistent
with the accidental fall

1559
01:24:57,370 --> 01:24:59,949
of Mr. Williams from
the cliff in question,

1560
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:03,099
as indicated in the
official police report.

1561
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:06,930
Therefore, I hereby
declare Mr. Reese Williams

1562
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:10,149
to be legally deceased.

1563
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:13,370
Thank you ladies and gentlemen,
this matter is closed.

1564
01:25:19,969 --> 01:25:22,249
Are you happy now, boy-o?

1565
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:24,769
Somebody just got away with murder.

1566
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:26,690
Can you live with that?

1567
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:52,570
So?

1568
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:54,929
How'd it go?

1569
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:58,609
It's done, your share
is in a numbered account

1570
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:00,339
in First Bahaman Bank and Trust.

1571
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:02,510
Here's the account number.

1572
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,010
Well, what do you know?

1573
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:11,979
You two girls finally did your jobs right.

1574
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:15,189
I told you we could pull this off.

1575
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:17,759
You promised to leave.

1576
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,299
What's your hurry?

1577
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:20,879
It's all over now.

1578
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,089
The longer you hang around here,

1579
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:24,849
the more chance there is
that someone might spot you.

1580
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:27,229
Oh, not to worry, darling.

1581
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:29,759
Besides, you and me and Ginny,

1582
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,799
we still have a little
unfinished business.

1583
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,859
How stupid do you think I am?

1584
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:35,369
We had a deal once, remember?

1585
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:38,119
Until one of you two witches
decided to try to kill me.

1586
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:40,099
Reese, neither one of us...

1587
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,680
No, no more talk.

1588
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:45,950
You call the bank.

1589
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:51,650
And wire your share into my account.

1590
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:53,930
Call!

1591
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,700
Right here, stop.

1592
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:05,780
Get out!

1593
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:08,490
Get out, come on, get out.

1594
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:24,690
Reese, what are you doing?

1595
01:27:24,691 --> 01:27:27,739
What, do you mean
you haven't figured it out yet?

1596
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:29,968
It was a damn good scheme
right from the beginning,

1597
01:27:29,969 --> 01:27:31,729
and it would've worked too,

1598
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:35,900
if one of you two hadn't
decided to double-cross me.

1599
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:38,049
Oh my God!

1600
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:40,888
I made it big
enough for two of you.

1601
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:42,909
Reese, don't be stupid.

1602
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:45,039
You can't kill us, you'll
never get away with this!

1603
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,259
Oh, you don't think so?

1604
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:48,218
Gee, I don't know, I'm
just a dead guy, remember?

1605
01:27:48,219 --> 01:27:49,439
But I'll tell you something,

1606
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,689
you know that insurance dick of yours?

1607
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:52,499
He already thinks that
one of you killed me,

1608
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,349
so by the time the two of you disappear

1609
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:55,629
and they discover the money's been wired

1610
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:57,609
down to the Bahamas,
they're just going to assume

1611
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:00,409
the two of you took the cash and split.

1612
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:02,899
And then, if anybody ever
does discover your bodies,

1613
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,509
which I doubt,

1614
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:08,909
and identifies them as the
once-lovely McElvey sisters,

1615
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:10,490
by then I'll be...

1616
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:14,580
Well, let's just say I'll be long gone.

1617
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:18,850
Reese!

1618
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,120
Oh, God.

1619
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:30,020
Oh, oh man.

1620
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:31,980
Oh, oh God.

1621
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:37,780
Oh God, I had to, he was
gonna kill you, and that...

1622
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:41,849
Mac told me that one of
you two had killed him,

1623
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:43,189
and I didn't wanna believe him

1624
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:44,869
but I didn't know what to think.

1625
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:46,159
Why didn't you say something?

1626
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:48,209
I saw the bruise on your
face the other night at dinner

1627
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:52,638
and I thought well, Jesus,
maybe the guy still is alive,

1628
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:56,379
so I watched, because I
had to know the truth.

1629
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:57,819
How much did you hear?

1630
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:59,660
His fall was staged!

1631
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,149
Wasn't it?

1632
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:04,638
And you withheld the truth from
me until after the hearing!

1633
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,299
That's not the whole truth, John.

1634
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,709
You don't have to do this, Kate.

1635
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,710
Yes I do.

1636
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:13,138
The whole thing, the phony
death scheme, it was my idea.

1637
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,429
The whole thing, the grieving widow,

1638
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:17,029
and the concerned older
sister, all of it, all of it!

1639
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:18,189
It was all part of an act.

1640
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:19,729
Oh you?

1641
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:21,718
I had to get away from him.

1642
01:29:21,719 --> 01:29:22,550
You understand?

1643
01:29:22,551 --> 01:29:24,099
I had to get away from him,

1644
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,609
and I couldn't find any other way out,

1645
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,529
and every time that I
would try to leave him,

1646
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:28,759
he would beat the hell out of me,

1647
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,718
and I didn't know what else to do!

1648
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:32,779
Then he needed more and more money

1649
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:35,019
and then finally he
threatened to tell Joey.

1650
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:36,308
That's when I agreed to help her.

1651
01:29:36,309 --> 01:29:38,529
He's hurt so many people
for so many years,

1652
01:29:38,530 --> 01:29:40,239
he wasn't going to hurt my son!

1653
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,859
I knew about the insurance policy,

1654
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:44,058
but I thought maybe there was some way

1655
01:29:44,059 --> 01:29:46,509
that we could put him in a position

1656
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:47,539
that he would have to disappear

1657
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:52,289
from everybody's life
forever in order to collect.

1658
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:55,049
We agreed that I would
present the scheme,

1659
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:57,949
so he would think it was my idea.

1660
01:29:57,950 --> 01:30:00,679
And it almost worked.

1661
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:04,850
The money is in a numbered
bank account in the Bahamas!

1662
01:30:06,370 --> 01:30:09,040
God, I'll make a full statement,

1663
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:12,009
just handle this any
way that you wanna do.

1664
01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:14,590
I'll do anything that you want.

1665
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:46,329
I was sure you'd turn out
to be a Class A investigator

1666
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:47,869
when you first came to work here.

1667
01:30:47,870 --> 01:30:49,620
Oh, I'm sorry, Mac.

1668
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:52,840
So am I.

1669
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:57,179
I sure enjoyed working with
you though, you're a good man.

1670
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:59,949
Oh, not quite good enough.

1671
01:30:59,950 --> 01:31:04,120
Without a body there
wasn't much anyone could do.

1672
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:07,058
Think they'll ever find him?

1673
01:31:07,059 --> 01:31:10,549
Chances are slim, about
five million to one.

1674
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:11,550
Yeah.

1675
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:13,879
But you never know.

1676
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:16,210
Jonah popped out of a whale.

1677
01:31:17,059 --> 01:31:18,469
Where you headed?

1678
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:23,830
Well, I've always wanted
to see Europe, Italy maybe.

1679
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:25,920
Venice!

1680
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:28,430
Venice?

1681
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:30,990
Ciao.

1682
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:32,980
See ya.

1683
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:40,930
Venice.

1684
01:31:43,889 --> 01:31:44,889
Hm, Venice.

1685
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,519
So is there anything
else you want me to do

1686
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:58,949
before you leave?

1687
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:00,099
I don't think so.

1688
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,269
You have my power of attorney.

1689
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:03,659
There's enough money now for Mom and Joey

1690
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:06,218
to live for the rest of their lives,

1691
01:32:06,219 --> 01:32:10,619
and I'm gonna do the traveling
that I always wanted to do.

1692
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:12,089
Italy, I think.

1693
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:15,299
I've always wanted to see Venice.

1694
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:17,109
I'm gonna miss you.

1695
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:18,218
I love you, Kate.

1696
01:32:18,219 --> 01:32:19,739
You too.

1697
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:21,859
It was almost a perfect plan.

1698
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:24,159
Hey, it worked out
right from the beginning.

1699
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:27,759
Not exactly, I never wanted
anybody to get hurt, you know?

1700
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,180
It was never part of my plan.

1701
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:40,790
I have something for you.

1702
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:49,959
I swear on Joey's life
I did not shoot Reese

1703
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,960
and neither did Charlie.

1704
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:57,558
Maybe Kenny, but he had nothing to gain.

1705
01:32:57,559 --> 01:33:00,629
It's over now, it doesn't really matter.

1706
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:04,020
I guess we'll never figure it out.

1707
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,240
When are you gonna teach me

1708
01:33:35,241 --> 01:33:36,869
how to shoot like you, Grandma?

1709
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:40,689
Oh someday, just like
I taught your mama.

1710
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:42,010
But guns kill, Joey.

1711
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:47,218
You must never aim a gun at someone.

1712
01:33:47,219 --> 01:33:50,050
You have to be very, very careful.
