[man]
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

5
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:14,125
<i>I look like everyone else.</i>

6
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:16,426
<i>No. I saw your files.</i>

7
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,195
<i>You're... you're...</i>

8
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:19,829
<i>An alien?</i>

- [boy chuckles]
- [sobbing]

11
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:40,717
Aliens are scary.

12
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:42,420
Aren't you glad
they're not real?

13
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:43,553
[continues sobbing]

14
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,691
Mom!

15
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:50,061
[Jonathan] Thanks
for calling, Deb.

16
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:53,297
[Deb] I mean, it wasn't
even that scary.

17
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,999
He just gets
a little jittery.

18
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:06,543
So that movie
really bothered you, huh?

19
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,852
You didn't say anything,
did you?

20
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:27,597
[Martha] It's been days!
It's not healthy.

21
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:29,400
[Jonathan]
It's a weak prescription.

22
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:31,634
Anyway, you try
taking them away.

23
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:36,140
Now he spends every waking minute,
trying to get that thing to work.

24
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:38,242
[Martha sighs] Maybe
we shouldn't have told him.

25
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:40,911
[Jonathan scoffs] He lifted a
tractor with one finger, Martha.

26
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:43,580
He was gonna figure it out.

27
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:47,418
[sighs] I don't want him
to feel different.

28
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:51,688
He is different.
And it scares him, for good reason.

29
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,158
Whoever put him in that ship
had no idea or care

30
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:57,461
for how dangerous a world
they were sending him to.

31
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:00,331
- [straining]
- [Jonathan] The more he knows, the more he can protect himself

32
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:01,531
and us.

33
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,771
We're supposed
to protect him, Jonathan.

34
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:09,240
Not the other way around.

35
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,642
[grunts in frustration]

<i>Right over left.</i>

38
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:43,773
- <i>Now, right over...</i>
- [Martha] <i>No! Left over right!</i>

39
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,742
<i>The image is flipped
on this thing.</i>

40
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,610
<i>What? No, it isn't.</i>

41
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:49,746
It's okay. I can manage.

42
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,282
You both worry too much.

43
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:54,051
<i>Shouldn't we?</i>

44
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,887
[soft chuckle] I can't read
that, Mom. It's...

45
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:59,957
You have to pull back
from the...

46
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:03,827
<i>"Flying Man of Metropolis,
Spotted Over South Side."</i>

47
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:06,263
<i>That's the third story
in two months.</i>

48
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,698
[Jonathan] <i>Metropolis
isn't Smallville.</i>

49
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:10,334
There are powerful
people there,

50
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:12,669
who would love nothing more
than to get their hands on...

51
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:16,907
You. Please, be careful.

52
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:20,277
I will. I am.

53
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,080
Now, I really do have to get to work.
Everyone's counting on me.

54
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:25,483
I'm a big part of the team
covering today's launch.

55
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:27,485
<i>Launch? Of what?</i>

56
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:29,686
You'll read about it tomorrow in
<i>the Daily Planet.</i> I love you. Bye.

[seagulls squawking]

59
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,118
Coffee boy! Over here.

60
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,722
Here yo go, Mr. Troupe.

61
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:07,925
Large skinny vanilla latte. No whip.
And I hope you don't mind,

62
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:12,196
I had them add a dash of cinnamon to
the grinds. It really wakes it up.

63
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:15,933
Mmm. Now, you know you don't
have to call me Mr. Troupe.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,968
And uh, you don't actually
have to call me...

65
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:19,970
[female reporter] Coffee boy,
get a move on!

66
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,704
[soft chuckle] Excuse me.

67
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:24,475
[all] Mr. Luthor,
what can you tell us about S.T.A.R. Labs?

68
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:27,011
[clamoring]

69
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,916
Today, is a great day
for Metropolis.

70
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,751
And indeed, the planet.

71
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:37,955
With any luck, we'll soon have
answered the age-old question,

72
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:40,991
"Are we alone in the universe?"

73
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:43,494
The good people at S.T.A.R.
Labs are about to launch

74
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:47,498
the most sophisticated,
orbital telescope the world has ever seen.

75
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:50,733
And it's all happening
via a two-stage, liquid-fueled

76
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,172
launch vehicle,
built by none other than LexCorp.

77
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:57,875
[all clamoring]

78
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,012
I'll only be taking
one question.

79
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,982
From the young woman
in the back. Hello, Lois.

80
00:06:08,252 --> 00:06:09,954
Lois Lane,
for those that don't know,

81
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,890
is the recipient of the
Luthor Journalism Scholarship.

82
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:14,992
Haven't heard from
you in months, Lois.

83
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:16,560
Studies keeping you busy?

84
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,862
I've definitely learned a lot.

85
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:20,497
Like how you built
that rocket with funds

86
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:23,234
you received from a rather
hefty government contract.

87
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:28,072
This president knows a good
investment, when he sees it.

88
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,574
Does he know fraud
when he sees it?

89
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,209
Gross negligence.

90
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,879
Not the question
I expected, Lois.

91
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:38,315
[button clicks]

92
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:40,150
[Lex on recording]
<i>That's how business is done.</i>

93
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:42,752
<i>I practically sat him
in the Oval Office myself.</i>

94
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,723
<i>He owes me. More champagne?</i>

95
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:48,359
<i>Legally, it's opaque.</i>

96
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:50,427
<i>So you set up a ten million
dollar space program</i>

97
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,931
<i>that the feds underwrite
to the tune of six billion...</i>

98
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,966
- <i>The rockets are junk, but...</i>
- [breaks]

99
00:06:57,101 --> 00:06:59,136
"But who knows,
they might fly,

100
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:01,838
and anyone moronic enough
to live close to a launch site

101
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:05,075
deserves to be hit
by fiery debris."

102
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,344
I have copies, Lex.

103
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,315
Well, I hope you enjoyed
the champagne, at least?

104
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,652
[clamoring]

105
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:16,387
[Lex] One at a time, please.

106
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:17,554
One at a time.

107
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:19,323
[grunts]

108
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:22,559
[grunts]

109
00:07:24,328 --> 00:07:26,297
[Clark] Looks like you
could use this more than me.

110
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,034
Oh, you're a life saver.
Early shift.

111
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,236
[slurps]

112
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:34,238
Mmm. Hmm.

113
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:36,040
That cinnamon
really wakes it up.

114
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:37,207
Yeah. I think so, too.

115
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:40,344
[camera shutters clicking]

116
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:43,147
Shouldn't you be part of this
feeding frenzy?

117
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,718
No. Well, uh, yes.
But, no.

118
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:49,787
Well, I'm glad
we cleared that up.

119
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:53,823
Well, I mean, I'm not a
reporter, not yet, anyway.

120
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,392
Just an intern.

121
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,827
How does an intern
become a reporter?

122
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,197
With a scoop like that.

123
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:03,934
[scientist over intercom]
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

124
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,235
<i>We have lift off!</i>

[engines firing]

126
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,486
- [Clark whistles]
- That's nothing.

127
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:24,855
I've seen stuff in there.

128
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,491
Experiments. Bizarre weapons.

129
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:29,993
Containment cells.

130
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,663
All designed to neutralize
the kind of weird powers

131
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,598
you read about these days.

132
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:36,700
[Jones] Super speed. Strength.

133
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,203
All that alien stuff.

134
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,271
It's like, we're preparing
for something.

135
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,807
If you ask me,

136
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:47,111
I'd say somebody already knows
we're not alone in the universe.

137
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,549
Can you get me inside?

138
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,650
Helluva scoop, huh?

139
00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:56,286
But no, uh... [inhales]

140
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,555
I gotta work.

141
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:02,359
My kid, he's in first grade.
We got another on the way.

142
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:04,628
What if my name came out?

143
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,598
I protect my people.

144
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:10,033
I think you're the one
that might need protecting.

145
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,104
[Jones] Two tours in Iraq.

146
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:16,807
I know a shadow
when I see it.

147
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,077
Someone's interested in you, kid.
I'd watch your back.

148
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:30,921
Look! Up in the sky!

149
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,366
Whoa! Hey, maybe we should...

150
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,835
[reporter talking indistinctly]

00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:46,437
[all talking indistinctly]

152
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,405
Damn.

[handcuffs clicking]

154
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:54,978
You gotta be kidding me.

Eyes up here!
Everybody, come on.

161
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:25,469
I know I don't say it very often, but I
am always, always, looking out for you!

162
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:27,337
- We're a team.
- [reporters murmuring]

163
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:33,710
That's why I'm showing you what
a real reporter looks like!

164
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,813
Maybe knock some sense into
the more worthless of you.

165
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:39,149
- [grumbling] Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, classic Perry!

166
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:41,920
Anyway, meet the newest
addition to the team.

167
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:46,056
The grad student who took
down a billionaire genius.

168
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,592
An actual talent. Lois Lane.

[all murmuring]

170
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,770
- A grad student? Are you kidding me with this?
- [man] Welcome, kid.

171
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:00,837
Welcome to the team.

172
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:06,677
See, now they hate you.
[chuckles] That couldn't have gone better.

173
00:12:07,946 --> 00:12:09,479

00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:33,303
Uh, Miss Lane.

177
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,405
Don't worry,
it's under control.

178
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:38,709
[machine whirring]

179
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:42,746
There. Lois, by the way.

180
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:44,147
Just... Lois.

181
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:46,283
Cool. Just Lois.

182
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:49,820
And you are?

183
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:52,155
Oh, I'm coffee... Uh, Clark.

184
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:54,625
I'm Clark Kent. <i>Daily Planet.</i>

185
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,259
No kidding.

186
00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:59,563
Right. [chuckles] Sorry. I'm just...
I was there at S.T.A.R. Labs.

187
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,899
I saw what you did.
It was amazing.

188
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:03,433
That creep had it coming.

189
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:07,404
Can I just... how did you do it?

190
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:09,439
I mean, I know, the champagne.

191
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,678
It wasn't like that.
Trust me.

192
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:18,749
People with that much power think
they wield it over everyone.

193
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:21,351
If you can take that away
from them, for a moment,

194
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:23,353
you can take it away for good.

195
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,989
It's called a power move.

196
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:28,492
And I don't want to brag,
but it's kind of my specialty.

197
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:31,395
Well that, and paper jams.

198
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:34,032
Any other questions?

199
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:38,136
If you're gonna be a reporter, kid,
you gotta ask all the questions.

200
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:40,671
It's just... what do you do now?

201
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,407
You've already taken down the
most powerful man in the world.

202
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:46,576
Have I?

203
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:50,247
Have a nice weekend,
Coffee Boy!

204
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,919
Uh, Lois, you left your...

205
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,535
Hmm.

206
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,174
All right.

223
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,759
'Course I never heard
of no flying Kryptonian!

They ain't got mirrors
on this dump?

244
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:43,214
You're as alien as they come
around here, Kryptonian.

245

Nah. [clicks]

00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:46,216
Well that's it.
Get back to work.

356
00:27:46,283 --> 00:27:49,553
[all talking indistinctly]

357
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:52,623
Speaking of the Superman,

358
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:54,458
though I think
Perry's right by the way,

359
00:27:54,525 --> 00:27:56,026
it's never going to catch on.

360
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,227
Didn't you have
an interview scheduled?

361
00:27:57,294 --> 00:27:59,931
Like five minutes ago?

362
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:03,834
[chuckles] Oh, Clark.
So innocent.

363
00:28:03,902 --> 00:28:05,802
I'm not going to that.

364
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,238
See, right now, the Superman is
waiting for me up there on the roof,

365
00:28:08,305 --> 00:28:11,009
getting more
and more impatient.

366
00:28:11,074 --> 00:28:13,477
Ah, it's a "power move."

367
00:28:13,544 --> 00:28:16,547
It's a power move.
Eventually, he'll give up

368
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,017
and, if he's the egomaniac
I think he is,

369
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:22,085
he will beg me to reschedule.

370
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:26,925
And when you do...

371
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:30,193
Big Brave Strong Man
will be putty in my hands.

372
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,663
He'll answer anything.

373
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:36,500
Where do you come from? Do you
report to some kind of leader?

374
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,405
It sounds like
you think he's...

375
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:44,976
Another alien?
He flies and can push rockets.

376
00:28:45,043 --> 00:28:47,244
Of course he is.

377
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:51,582
But, uh, what if he denies it?

378
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,684
Then he's fallen
right into my trap.

379
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,786
See, by then, I'll have
gotten the real truth

380
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:58,388
from my interview
with the loud, hairy one.

381
00:28:58,455 --> 00:29:00,691
Wait, you're interviewing Lobo?

382
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:03,226
Isn't he locked up
at S.T.A.R. Labs?

383
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:05,228
He knows the Superman.

384
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:08,298
He wants to take him down,
but now he's behind bars.

385
00:29:08,365 --> 00:29:12,102
Lucky for Lobo, I'm not.

386
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,404
So that's it.
You took down Luthor

387
00:29:14,471 --> 00:29:17,774
and now you're doing
an expose on the Flying Man?

388
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:20,410
No.

389
00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:23,280
I'm winning a Pulitzer
for my revelatory takedown

390
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:26,985
of the alien who calls himself
"The Superman."

391
00:29:27,051 --> 00:29:28,619
He doesn't call himself that!

392
00:29:33,457 --> 00:29:37,594
Not "Flying Man,"
not "Superman," not "Clark..."

393
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:41,365
Certainly not "Kryptonian."

394
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:43,500
It's everything
you warned me about.

395
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:44,902
They meet someone
from the stars

396
00:29:44,969 --> 00:29:47,905
and their first instinct
is to fire at will.

397
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,208
They love you.

398
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:56,513
They don't know me.

399
00:29:57,581 --> 00:30:00,417
And I'm afraid that,
when they do...

400
00:30:00,484 --> 00:30:03,220
Maybe you're what they need.
If they knew about you,

401
00:30:03,286 --> 00:30:04,788
maybe they'd
see things differently.

402
00:30:04,856 --> 00:30:09,426
Or maybe the government
will lock him up, or worse.

403
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:11,062
At some point
they're gonna ask me

404
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:13,530
where I'm from
and why I was sent here,

405
00:30:13,597 --> 00:30:16,299
and I won't have the answers.

406
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:18,201
And in the meantime,
one way or another,

407
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:22,572
Lois is going to
publish her expose.

408
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:25,609
You know what we're gonna say.
What we've always said.

409
00:30:25,676 --> 00:30:29,579
"The world is dangerous
and unforgiving."

410
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:32,950
If you're different, special,
you have two options.

411
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:34,518
You can either...

412
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:36,186
"Either meet it head-on
and accept the consequences,

413
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:39,489
or you can keep your head down
and accept the consequences.

414
00:30:39,556 --> 00:30:41,224
There's no wrong choice,
but..."

415
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,427
You have to make one.

416
00:30:43,861 --> 00:30:45,328
Why?

417
00:30:45,395 --> 00:30:48,598
Because you're not
our little boy anymore.

418
00:30:48,665 --> 00:30:51,668
Becoming a man means making
these choices for yourself.

419
00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:54,005
Just be ready,

420
00:30:54,072 --> 00:30:57,841
because each choice,
each action, has a consequence.

421
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:14,291
Excuse me, do we know...

422
00:31:14,357 --> 00:31:15,459
Nothing yet.

423
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:18,762
Is Daddy gonna be okay?

424
00:31:20,131 --> 00:31:23,868
[monitors beeping]

425
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:34,745
[surgeon] Here we go.

426
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,882
[squelching]

427
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:42,452
[med student] Half the liver,
one kidney, the spleen.

428
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,654
Every day another organ fails.

429
00:31:44,721 --> 00:31:46,958
What the hell happened
to this guy?

430
00:31:47,024 --> 00:31:48,458
[surgeon] I'm going to
close him back up.

431
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:49,894
Give me the... [gasps]

432
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:51,528
[grunting]

433
00:31:52,864 --> 00:31:55,332
[surgeon] Code Black!
Call it in! Go!

434
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:58,401
[man] Agh! Agh!

435
00:32:01,438 --> 00:32:03,673
[both screaming]

436
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:13,416
[groaning]

437
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:34,838
[vehicle rattling]

438
00:32:34,906 --> 00:32:37,707
I know it's not for good,
but sure is nice

439
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:40,310
having you here
helping out, Clark.

440
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,146
Pa, I can help anytime.

441
00:32:42,213 --> 00:32:44,282
It takes me less than ten minutes
to get here from the city,

442
00:32:44,347 --> 00:32:46,250
you just have to
let me know when...

443
00:32:46,316 --> 00:32:47,417
Clark?

444
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:49,053
Stop the truck.

445
00:33:08,272 --> 00:33:10,107
[Jonathan] Evening, stranger.

446
00:33:11,275 --> 00:33:13,044
I've come for your son.

447
00:33:16,214 --> 00:33:17,714
[Martha] Our son isn't here.

448
00:33:19,283 --> 00:33:21,118
Something we can do for ya?

449
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,055
You can tell me where he is.

450
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:28,192
Sir, unless you want to
show us some credentials,

451
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:30,393
I think we're done here.

452
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:33,898
Martha, get behind me.

453
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:37,301
I'm sorry.

454
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:39,303
Sorry for wh... [grunts]

455
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:44,407
Jonathan? What's happening?
What are you doing to him?

456
00:33:49,313 --> 00:33:50,847
[Clark grunts]

457
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,893
Get inside, lock the doors.

458
00:34:30,754 --> 00:34:32,722
Are you another bounty hunter?

459
00:34:32,789 --> 00:34:33,823
[grunts]

460
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,559
[grunting]

461
00:34:38,428 --> 00:34:39,596
[grunts]

462
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:42,766
I am no Bounty Hunter.

463
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,402
[panting]

464
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:47,737
My name is J'onn.

465
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:52,542
And I only wish to
speak with you.

466
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:02,153
Call me when you
need the refill.

467
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:05,990
Ahem. Next?

468
00:35:06,057 --> 00:35:09,160
[Jones groaning]

469
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:11,262
[grunting]

470
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:14,831
Uh, did, uh, someone call in
a prescription for you, sir?

471
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:17,734
Pain... I have... so much...

472
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:20,271
- Sir, you don't look...
- Drugs.

473
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:23,074
I'm sorry, without a
prescription, I can't help you.

474
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,043
But there is a clinic nearby
where you can detox...

475
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,311
I need to get home!

476
00:35:27,378 --> 00:35:29,713
[choking]

477
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:34,651
I need...

478
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:37,121
a post-surgical analgesic.

479
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:39,622
Fentanyl.

480
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:41,624
I need fentanyl!

481
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:49,200
[gasping]

482
00:35:49,266 --> 00:35:52,169
[heavy breathing]

483
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:53,204
Huh?

484
00:35:58,042 --> 00:35:59,809
- [yelling]
- [woman screams]

485
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:01,678
[man screams]

486
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:04,115
[woman whimpers]

487
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:09,586
I apologize
for frightening you earlier.

488
00:36:09,652 --> 00:36:11,255
- Are you...
- I'm fine.

489
00:36:11,322 --> 00:36:14,524
Just don't get
in my head again, okay?

490
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:17,727
I'm sure you boys
have a lot to talk about.

491
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:21,132
Clark, if...
John is staying over,

492
00:36:21,198 --> 00:36:23,300
there are sheets
in the hall cupboard and...

493
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:25,635
We're fine, Ma. G'night.

494
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:37,814
I thought Martians
only existed in the movies.

495
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:42,219
Those movies are terrible.

496
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:49,659
Thank you. For S.T.A.R. Labs.
You saved my life.

497
00:36:51,828 --> 00:36:55,199
I should never have
revealed my natural form.

498
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:57,034
Why did you?

499
00:36:57,101 --> 00:36:59,602
I mean, if you can
disguise yourself...

500
00:36:59,669 --> 00:37:01,472
To distract Lobo.

501
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:04,341
He came for
the last Kryptonian.

502
00:37:04,408 --> 00:37:07,278
I offered him something
of equal value.

503
00:37:07,344 --> 00:37:11,282
You're... the last.
You're like me.

504
00:37:14,051 --> 00:37:17,121
It was
a foolish miscalculation.

505
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:20,257
This world wasn't ready.

506
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:25,863
Ready or not, Lobo came to us.
That's when everything changed.

507
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:29,433
Nevertheless, I will be
reverting to human form

508
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,904
and maintaining a low profile
for the foreseeable future.

509
00:37:33,971 --> 00:37:36,540
I advise you to do the same.

510
00:37:36,606 --> 00:37:39,910
If we remain hidden, we live.

511
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:43,581
Doesn't sound like
much of a life.

512
00:37:43,646 --> 00:37:45,015
Perhaps not.

513
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:48,018
But as the last survivors
of our people,

514
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:51,754
is self-preservation
not our chief responsibility?

515
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,894
I have seen firsthand
how rampant xenophobia

516
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:59,997
can destroy
a great civilization.

517
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:02,867
If humanity is to have
a chance to thrive,

518
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:06,836
we mustn't further
stoke its fears.

519
00:38:06,904 --> 00:38:09,406
I don't think anything
can stop that now.

520
00:38:09,473 --> 00:38:13,444
<i>The Daily Planet</i> is about to
publish the truth about me.

521
00:38:13,511 --> 00:38:15,012
Then we must stop them.

522
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:17,414
J'onn, this world
is beginning to see me

523
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:19,049
as some sort of champion.

524
00:38:20,117 --> 00:38:22,586
What if knowing
the truth about me

525
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:23,888
is what turns this around,

526
00:38:23,954 --> 00:38:26,190
makes people
see things differently?

527
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:33,330
You are an optimist, Kal-El.

528
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:35,466
Like your father.

529
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,700
Kal-El?

530
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:40,404
Forgive me.
When I first became aware

531
00:38:40,471 --> 00:38:43,607
that you possess abilities
similar to my own,

532
00:38:43,673 --> 00:38:47,211
I assumed...
hoped you were Martian.

533
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:51,781
I attempted a telepathic link
between our minds

534
00:38:51,848 --> 00:38:53,384
and in doing so,

535
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:57,588
I inadvertently accessed
your memories of Krypton.

536
00:38:57,655 --> 00:38:59,623
I have no memories of Krypton.

537
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:01,892
You were only an infant.

538
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,727
[beeping]

539
00:39:05,828 --> 00:39:07,198
[powers up]

540
00:39:14,038 --> 00:39:16,440
I've never been able to
make this thing work.

541
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:28,886
Is that...

542
00:39:28,953 --> 00:39:31,121
Your parents.

543
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:33,123
I was able to pick up
some Kryptonian

544
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,025
from your memories of them.

545
00:39:35,092 --> 00:39:38,795
I could teach you and help you
access those memories.

546
00:39:38,862 --> 00:39:40,464
But you should know
that the last thing

547
00:39:40,531 --> 00:39:44,935
your mother ever said to you
was that "to dwell in the past

548
00:39:45,002 --> 00:39:47,271
is to lose one's path."

549
00:39:52,176 --> 00:39:54,612
You have
a weighty decision to make.

550
00:39:54,678 --> 00:39:56,247
I'll leave you to it.

551
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,154
[Clark] Wait.

552
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:06,957
How will I find you?

553
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:08,892
[J'onn speaking telepathically]
<i>Just listen.</i>

554
00:40:30,014 --> 00:40:31,814
Have you been up all night?

555
00:40:31,882 --> 00:40:33,984
Yeah, pretty much.

556
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:37,221
Thank you.

557
00:40:37,288 --> 00:40:39,156
Twenty-four years
collecting dust

558
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:41,859
and your new friend
gets it working in one try.

559
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,360
So what is it?

560
00:40:43,427 --> 00:40:46,330
I don't know.
Some kind of historical record?

561
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:49,099
I've barely
scratched the surface.

562
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:51,201
It was incredible, Ma.

563
00:40:51,268 --> 00:40:53,470
I can't believe
I'll never get to see it.

564
00:40:55,072 --> 00:40:56,573
Maybe you will.

565
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,009
I'm beginning to think
you can do almost anything.

566
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:02,179
Go anywhere. Only...

567
00:41:03,914 --> 00:41:04,915
What?

568
00:41:04,982 --> 00:41:06,550
You can go anywhere,

569
00:41:06,617 --> 00:41:10,554
but, as all those photos
posted all over the world show,

570
00:41:10,621 --> 00:41:12,890
your clothes can't.

571
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:22,599
Did you make this?

572
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:26,804
From the only fabric I know
that's been to outer space.

573
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,606
You were swaddled in it
when we found you.

574
00:41:31,442 --> 00:41:34,244
Otherwise, I just copied
the design of that nice Batman

575
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:36,880
I always see in the papers
at the checkout.

576
00:41:39,183 --> 00:41:40,617
You even did the cape.

577
00:41:40,684 --> 00:41:42,319
Now I don't know
if it'll hold up

578
00:41:42,386 --> 00:41:43,987
to the stress
you'll put it through,

579
00:41:44,054 --> 00:41:46,023
but we went through
16 bandsaw blades

580
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,792
just to cut the fabric, so...

581
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:51,061
Whattaya think?

582
00:41:51,128 --> 00:41:53,063
I think you're saying

583
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,066
you want me to
tell the world who I really am.

584
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:58,402
No, I'm saying

585
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:02,106
we're not buying you any more
nice clothes to destroy.

586
00:42:03,707 --> 00:42:06,610
I love it, Ma. Thank you.

587
00:42:12,716 --> 00:42:14,351
[Jonathan] It's out!

588
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:30,100
Well?

589
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:32,236
It's only part one.
She's teasing something big,

590
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:35,205
but won't say what
until she interviews Lobo.

591
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:38,475
I have to get back
to Metropolis.

592
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:40,811
Maybe I can get her
to put the brakes on

593
00:42:40,879 --> 00:42:42,746
while I figure out what to do.

594
00:42:42,813 --> 00:42:44,715
What about your laundry?

595
00:42:44,782 --> 00:42:45,983
I'll get it later.

596
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:48,552
Love the suit,
especially the cape!

597
00:42:50,954 --> 00:42:52,723
You added a cape?

598
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,525
I think it looks cool.

599
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:02,466
[Lobo laughing]

600
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:03,767
[Lois] Stop it!

601
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:07,638
[Lobo] Oh, don't like that one?
How 'bout this:

602
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:10,441
"I met an old female in heat"

603
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:14,645
[Lois] Stop! Oh, my God!
What is wrong with you?

604
00:43:15,746 --> 00:43:17,815
Why don't I show ya?

605
00:43:17,882 --> 00:43:19,851
Come on, girlie.

606
00:43:19,918 --> 00:43:23,053
[electricity buzzing]

607
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:32,996
[heavy breathing]

608
00:43:33,063 --> 00:43:34,832
Good for you?

609
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:36,500
Last question.

610
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:38,635
You told me he's the only one
of his people here on Earth.

611
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,103
Are there more on the way?

612
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,841
Kryptonians? Yeah,
they're on their way all right.

613
00:43:43,908 --> 00:43:47,244
A whole army
comin' just for him.

614
00:43:47,311 --> 00:43:50,314
And those bloodthirsty
sons of bitches don't care

615
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,083
who they gotta liquify
to get 'im.

616
00:43:54,618 --> 00:43:56,787
Nah! [laughs]

617
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:58,188
Jes' kiddin'.

618
00:43:58,255 --> 00:43:59,858
They're all dead,

619
00:43:59,924 --> 00:44:03,694
but you shoulda seen
the look on yer face though!

620
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,195
Classic!

621
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:10,767
[beeping open]

622
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:13,303
[Lobo] And then summa this.
And summa that.

623
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,573
And then I give it a little
bit 'o wam-bam-boom...

624
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,276
Ugh. All right,
that's enough.

625
00:44:19,343 --> 00:44:20,945
[sighs] That's enough.

626
00:44:21,011 --> 00:44:24,883
That wasn't even half
the Appellaxian mating dance.

627
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:26,483
I don't blame ya,

628
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,685
- I'm a whole lotta man...
- We're done here.

629
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:30,354
- [laughs]
- Open up.

[gasps]

631
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:34,057

now, sweetybits.

You did this!

653
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:55,105
Hey, man,
I jes' work here.

654
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:57,407

Okay then.

00:46:30,574 --> 00:46:33,543
[laughs]

666
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:36,713

put my bike.

Are you all right, Miss Lane?

673
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:13,183
I think so.

674
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,751
Paramedics are on their way.

675
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,554
But I have to go after him.

676
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:21,458
Superman?

677
00:47:21,525 --> 00:47:23,694
You're right about my origins,
Lois,

678
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:26,263
but not my intentions.

679
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,332
Please don't run your story.

680
00:47:29,399 --> 00:47:31,334
I should be the one
to tell the world.

681
00:47:35,472 --> 00:47:36,974
First you have to save it.

682
00:47:39,476 --> 00:47:41,244
We're overdue
for that interview.

Maybe when this is over.

685
00:47:45,749 --> 00:47:46,817
I'll be there.

686
00:47:46,884 --> 00:47:48,285
No games, I promise.

687
00:47:50,587 --> 00:47:53,757

Don't let him touch you.

00:49:25,016 --> 00:49:26,449
[thuds]

715
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:31,454
[laser surge]

716
00:49:34,324 --> 00:49:37,661
[maliciously] Oh, yes...

717
00:49:38,728 --> 00:49:40,463
Yes...

718
00:49:41,132 --> 00:49:43,366
More...

719
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,972
[rumbling]

720
00:49:49,606 --> 00:49:51,075
How are we doing J'onn?

721
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,712
- [both grunting]
- [thuds]

722
00:49:59,016 --> 00:50:00,383
[muffled grunt]

723
00:50:04,354 --> 00:50:06,090
[roars]

724
00:50:06,157 --> 00:50:07,824
Yes...

725
00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:10,027
Yes...

726
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:14,966
Kent.

727
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:17,068
The intern...

728
00:50:18,302 --> 00:50:21,138
Or is it Kal-El?

729
00:50:21,205 --> 00:50:24,308
- [muffled grunt]
- [growling]

730
00:50:24,374 --> 00:50:28,411
- [laughs maliciously]
- [grunting]

731
00:50:30,047 --> 00:50:30,915
- [thuds]
- [grunts]

732
00:50:30,982 --> 00:50:33,416
No, don't touch him.

733
00:50:34,384 --> 00:50:35,953
[grunts]

734
00:50:37,687 --> 00:50:39,422
- [thuds]
- [grunts]

735
00:50:41,558 --> 00:50:43,526
J'onn J'onzz...

736
00:50:43,593 --> 00:50:45,263
the manhunter...

737
00:50:45,329 --> 00:50:46,563
[J'onn grunts]

738
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,466
[laughing]

739
00:50:50,368 --> 00:50:51,701
[straining]

740
00:50:52,602 --> 00:50:54,005
Stop this.

741
00:50:55,006 --> 00:50:56,506
Please.

742
00:50:56,573 --> 00:50:59,010
[laughs maliciously]

743
00:50:59,076 --> 00:51:01,444
No. No, please.

744
00:51:04,781 --> 00:51:05,883
Ahhh.

745
00:51:06,549 --> 00:51:08,418
[screams]

746
00:51:11,688 --> 00:51:14,691
[pained scream]

747
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,468
- Oh!
- [Parasite laughs]

748
00:51:41,484 --> 00:51:42,954
[gasps]

749
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,588
[breathes heavily]

750
00:51:52,495 --> 00:51:54,597
[sighs sharply]

751
00:51:57,301 --> 00:51:58,601
[groans]

752
00:52:14,651 --> 00:52:15,752
[frustrated grunts]

753
00:52:15,819 --> 00:52:17,554
[breathes heavily]

754
00:52:18,155 --> 00:52:19,556
[grunts]

755
00:52:19,622 --> 00:52:20,824
[moans]

756
00:52:23,793 --> 00:52:25,662
- [knock on door]
- [Lois] Clark!

757
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:27,064
- Hey, Clark!
- [knocking]

758
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:31,801
- Clark?
- It was unlocked.

759
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:33,971
What happened?

760
00:52:34,038 --> 00:52:35,306
I, uh...

761
00:52:35,373 --> 00:52:36,673
I broke the glass.

762
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,608
No kidding.

763
00:52:38,675 --> 00:52:40,077
I mean, what were you doing

764
00:52:40,144 --> 00:52:42,213
in the middle
of the attack yesterday?

765
00:52:42,279 --> 00:52:43,280
How did you know?

766
00:52:44,848 --> 00:52:46,484
You gave a statement
to the police.

767
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:47,852
You know, Clark,

768
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:49,552
there are much easier ways
to get the story.

769
00:52:50,388 --> 00:52:51,255
There are?

770
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:52,822
No!

771
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,125
Actually running in there

772
00:52:54,191 --> 00:52:55,558
was exactly what
I should have done.

773
00:52:56,494 --> 00:52:58,095
Why are you here?

774
00:52:58,162 --> 00:53:00,830
Perry read the police report
and asked me to check on you.

775
00:53:02,632 --> 00:53:05,835
Actually he ordered me
to fire you

776
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:07,570
for not showing up today but

777
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:09,773
I think I got
the translation right.

778
00:53:16,414 --> 00:53:18,015
Well, did you see him
in action?

779
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:22,053
Who?

780
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:23,220
The Superman.

781
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:24,288
Oh.

782
00:53:24,355 --> 00:53:25,523
Yeah.

783
00:53:25,588 --> 00:53:27,124
And the Martian Manhunter.

784
00:53:27,191 --> 00:53:29,726
The Martian Manhunter?
That's terrible.

785
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:31,761
But it's your story so...

786
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:34,564
It burnt him alive, Lois.

787
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:36,867
That Parasite thing.

788
00:53:37,935 --> 00:53:39,904
I can still hear the screams.

789
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:42,973
And the Superman?

790
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:51,215
I think he's dead, too.

791
00:53:56,187 --> 00:53:57,321
Lois, this job...

792
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:00,858
Not what you expected?

793
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,528
It's so much harder...

794
00:54:04,594 --> 00:54:07,531
this whole story.

795
00:54:07,597 --> 00:54:09,033
I'd only just gotten started

796
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,202
and now I think
I may have lost it.

797
00:54:12,203 --> 00:54:13,170
Maybe for good.

798
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:16,273
Clark.

799
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:18,808
You've chosen a job

800
00:54:18,876 --> 00:54:19,944
that can put you face to face

801
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,279
to some pretty bad stuff.

802
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:25,715
You try and make a difference
and fight for truth,

803
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:27,184
justice,

804
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:28,685
and sometimes
you get smacked down.

805
00:54:28,751 --> 00:54:30,820
But let me tell you,
Clark Kent.

806
00:54:30,888 --> 00:54:32,289
If this is what you want,

807
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:33,656
if it's who you are,

808
00:54:33,723 --> 00:54:35,259
then you have to do it.

809
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,595
But this job takes guts.

810
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,497
It takes risk.

811
00:54:39,563 --> 00:54:41,298
And maybe
one of those risks is,

812
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:42,900
when you feel overwhelmed

813
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:44,301
to open yourself up

814
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:46,703
and ask someone
smarter than you for help.

815
00:54:48,606 --> 00:54:50,707
Someone smarter than me?

816
00:54:50,773 --> 00:54:52,775
I bet, they're closer
than you think.

817
00:54:54,644 --> 00:54:56,046
You're totally right.

818
00:54:57,148 --> 00:54:58,048
Perfect.

819
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:00,650
First, give me your source.

820
00:55:01,952 --> 00:55:04,654
Lois, did you come here
to steal my story?

821
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:05,688
What?

822
00:55:05,755 --> 00:55:07,757
No! No!

823
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:12,062
I thought that
we would share it.

824
00:55:12,129 --> 00:55:13,696
You know what,
thanks for coming, Lois.

825
00:55:13,763 --> 00:55:14,865
Really, thank you.
Tell Perry

826
00:55:14,932 --> 00:55:16,901
he can't fire me
because I quit.

827
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:19,136
For now, sorry, I got to go.

828
00:55:19,203 --> 00:55:20,703
What? Where?

829
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:21,939
To talk to someone smart.

830
00:55:22,006 --> 00:55:23,908
I was going to split
the byline.

831
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,228
Is it still Halloween?

832
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,264
No.

833
00:55:47,331 --> 00:55:48,566
Let's just say,
it's more practical

834
00:55:48,632 --> 00:55:50,267
than cargos and aviator caps.

835
00:55:52,303 --> 00:55:53,736
Ah-ha.

836
00:55:53,803 --> 00:55:55,139
And what's the "S" for?

837
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,341
Superman.

838
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:00,277
Right.

839
00:56:00,344 --> 00:56:02,845
Well, Superman,
what's this about?

840
00:56:04,348 --> 00:56:05,316
I need your help.

841
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:08,185
I've seen you in action,
flyboy.

842
00:56:08,252 --> 00:56:10,254
You're as powerful
as a locomotive.

843
00:56:11,388 --> 00:56:12,590
More.

844
00:56:12,656 --> 00:56:14,024
Usually.

845
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:17,161
So how could I possibly
help you?

846
00:56:18,429 --> 00:56:19,930
I need to get into space.

847
00:56:20,397 --> 00:56:22,166
Fast.

848
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:24,902
Not the most practical
getaway plan.

849
00:56:28,572 --> 00:56:29,839
The sun!

850
00:56:29,907 --> 00:56:32,343
It's like a power source
for you, isn't it?

851
00:56:32,409 --> 00:56:34,378
And if you need help
getting closer to it,

852
00:56:34,445 --> 00:56:35,713
that means you're...

853
00:56:35,778 --> 00:56:36,914
powerless.

854
00:56:37,681 --> 00:56:38,882
Interesting.

855
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:42,620
You've seen the news reports.

856
00:56:42,686 --> 00:56:45,522
This creature, this Parasite.

857
00:56:46,724 --> 00:56:48,492
It killed my friend.

858
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,761
Now everyone is in danger
and I can't stop it.

859
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:53,497
Not like this.

860
00:56:53,564 --> 00:56:54,764
Can you help me?

861
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,234
Of course I can, but...

862
00:56:58,168 --> 00:56:58,936
[sighs]

863
00:56:59,003 --> 00:57:00,404
How much do you want?

864
00:57:01,372 --> 00:57:03,374
Money? I have money.

865
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,609
No, I don't want anything
but to help.

866
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:09,046
It can only look good
to the parole board.

867
00:57:09,113 --> 00:57:11,415
But I can't help you
from in here.

868
00:57:11,482 --> 00:57:12,916
I have to get out.

869
00:57:12,983 --> 00:57:15,386
That's not going to happen,
Luthor.

870
00:57:15,452 --> 00:57:16,854
Relax.

871
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,322
I can get a day pass.

872
00:57:19,657 --> 00:57:20,891
A day pass?

873
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:23,360
That's not even a thing.

874
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:25,795
Wanna bet?

875
00:57:41,278 --> 00:57:42,513
Kaylie!

876
00:57:42,579 --> 00:57:43,647
Breakfast!

877
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:46,250
I can't find my shoe, Mommy!

878
00:57:52,289 --> 00:57:53,924
[sighs]

879
00:57:53,991 --> 00:57:56,160
[heart pounding]

880
00:58:14,678 --> 00:58:16,380
- Ahhh!
- [gasps]

881
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:20,918
Kaylie, what's wrong?

882
00:58:20,984 --> 00:58:22,553
[sobs]

883
00:58:26,123 --> 00:58:27,591
[sighs sadly]

884
00:58:46,243 --> 00:58:47,945
It's good to be home.

885
00:58:48,512 --> 00:58:50,013
You live here?

886
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,215
Practically.

887
00:58:54,418 --> 00:58:56,420
So this "Parasite" zaps
your powers,

888
00:58:56,487 --> 00:58:58,522
now you're a filthy mortal
like the rest of us.

889
00:58:58,589 --> 00:58:59,590
Do I have it?

890
00:59:00,524 --> 00:59:01,625
Something like that.

891
00:59:01,692 --> 00:59:03,093
I still have my abilities

892
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,661
but they are very weak.

893
00:59:04,728 --> 00:59:05,929
Some more than others.

894
00:59:05,996 --> 00:59:07,231
It may be slow going,

895
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:09,133
but you'll return
to full strength.

896
00:59:11,135 --> 00:59:12,369
- Eventually.
- [keyboard clacking]

897
00:59:12,436 --> 00:59:14,838
There's no time.
I need a jump start.

898
00:59:14,905 --> 00:59:17,040
Can you shoot me
into orbit or not?

899
00:59:17,107 --> 00:59:19,176
I'm not launching you
into space.

900
00:59:19,243 --> 00:59:20,310
Why not?

901
00:59:20,377 --> 00:59:22,746
Because you are right now
a fragile egg.

902
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:24,248
Untrained and unprepared

903
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:26,517
for the grueling reality
of space flight.

904
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:29,153
Unless your secret identity
is an astronaut.

905
00:59:30,754 --> 00:59:32,589
- Didn't think so.
- [keyboard clacking continues]

906
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:33,757
Anyway, don't worry.

907
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:35,125
I have a plan.

908
00:59:42,433 --> 00:59:44,968
This is from S.T.A.R. labs.
How did you get this?

909
00:59:45,035 --> 00:59:46,203
Yup.

910
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:48,238
There's your problem.

911
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,407
The janitor...

912
00:59:50,474 --> 00:59:52,676
That grenade
was an organic EMP,

913
00:59:52,743 --> 00:59:54,011
designed to absorb

914
00:59:54,077 --> 00:59:56,346
all the power
it comes in contact with.

915
00:59:56,413 --> 00:59:59,082
It's almost like it
melded with the janitor's DNA

916
00:59:59,149 --> 01:00:01,585
and turned him into
some kind of energy vampire.

917
01:00:03,922 --> 01:00:06,123
It takes everything.

918
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,926
How do you fight
something like that?

919
01:00:07,991 --> 01:00:09,726
I just told you.

920
01:00:09,793 --> 01:00:12,329
"It takes everything."

921
01:00:12,396 --> 01:00:14,598
It's like buying a company,
when you absorb the assets,

922
01:00:14,665 --> 01:00:17,534
you also absorb
the vulnerabilities.

923
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:21,104
If we can employ those,
we can defeat it.

924
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:24,741
So... what are Superman's
weaknesses?

925
01:00:24,808 --> 01:00:26,743
I don't know. I'm not sure
if I ever had any.

926
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:27,912
I wasn't talking to you.

927
01:00:27,978 --> 01:00:30,013
[footsteps approaching]

928
01:00:32,683 --> 01:00:34,384
[gulping]

929
01:00:35,018 --> 01:00:36,019
Lobo.

930
01:00:36,086 --> 01:00:37,087
Even on the inside,

931
01:00:37,154 --> 01:00:38,655
I like to keep close tabs

932
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,390
on all the happenings
about town.

933
01:00:40,457 --> 01:00:42,961
Once the Czarnian here
was liberated from the cell

934
01:00:43,026 --> 01:00:44,528
you put him in
at S.T.A.R. Labs...

935
01:00:44,595 --> 01:00:46,196
[belches]

936
01:00:46,263 --> 01:00:48,098
Thanks fer that, by the way.

937
01:00:48,165 --> 01:00:50,000
it was an easy matter
for one of my surrogates

938
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:51,535
to track down
the bounty hunter

939
01:00:51,602 --> 01:00:52,904
and... cut a deal.

940
01:00:52,971 --> 01:00:54,204
A deal?

941
01:00:54,271 --> 01:00:56,173
You might say
I bought the company.

942
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,610
- Lobo is now my asset...
- [glass breaking]

943
01:00:59,676 --> 01:01:01,478
...or vulnerability.

944
01:01:01,545 --> 01:01:02,579
Time will tell.

945
01:01:03,982 --> 01:01:05,315
The ring.

946
01:01:05,382 --> 01:01:08,018
Carved from irradiated remains
of Krypton.

947
01:01:08,085 --> 01:01:10,420
I don't know how or why,
but it weakened me.

948
01:01:10,855 --> 01:01:11,788
A lot.

949
01:01:14,825 --> 01:01:18,295
That's what we use to fight off
the superpowered Parasite.

950
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:25,937
[electrical buzzing]

951
01:01:26,004 --> 01:01:27,972
Extraordinary amount
of radiation

952
01:01:28,038 --> 01:01:29,673
for something so minuscule.

953
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,209
Harmless to humans,

954
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:34,545
but having absorbed
your powers...

955
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:35,746
this might work.

956
01:01:35,812 --> 01:01:38,382
[electrical buzzing ceases]

957
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:40,517
We just need
to get its attention.

958
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:46,256
Mmm,

959
01:01:46,323 --> 01:01:49,126
somethin' I like
about this place.

960
01:01:49,192 --> 01:01:50,895
This plant powers
the entire city.

961
01:01:50,962 --> 01:01:52,262
Where is everybody?

962
01:01:52,696 --> 01:01:55,265
[laughs]

963
01:01:55,332 --> 01:01:58,835
I called in a bomb threat
before we left.

964
01:01:58,903 --> 01:02:00,771
You shouldn't lie about bombs.

965
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,173
[chuckles]

966
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,675
- I didn't.
- [beeping]

967
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:08,445
[laughs cunningly]

968
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:28,699
[electrical humming]

969
01:02:28,765 --> 01:02:31,234
Looks like Lex was able
to boost the output.

970
01:02:32,003 --> 01:02:33,236
Now we wait.

971
01:02:42,346 --> 01:02:45,182
[low rumble]

972
01:02:51,722 --> 01:02:55,492

[growling]

974
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:00,098
Wait's over.

975
01:03:00,163 --> 01:03:02,566
It's ass-whoopin'
time.

976
01:03:02,633 --> 01:03:05,168
[low growl]

977
01:03:15,046 --> 01:03:16,114
Here we go.

978
01:03:16,179 --> 01:03:17,514
Feeling any stronger?

979
01:03:17,581 --> 01:03:18,649
Let's see.

980
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,867
[roars]

981
01:03:38,136 --> 01:03:39,569

01:03:39,636 --> 01:03:40,504
[groans]

983
01:03:43,206 --> 01:03:45,943
Well? Am I paying you
to stand around?

984
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:49,479
Yeah, yeah, don't get
your panties in a twist.

985
01:03:51,883 --> 01:03:53,617
[whistles]

986
01:03:53,684 --> 01:03:55,652
Hell, yeah!

987
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:02,826
[thuds]

988
01:04:07,065 --> 01:04:09,499
[laughs boisterously]

989
01:04:12,036 --> 01:04:14,172
Whoo...

990
01:04:14,237 --> 01:04:15,439
[thuds]

991
01:04:16,673 --> 01:04:17,674
[grunting]

992
01:04:22,245 --> 01:04:24,448
Go down, damn it!

993
01:04:28,052 --> 01:04:30,320
The ring, it's not working.

994
01:04:30,387 --> 01:04:31,688
It looks like there's a limit

995
01:04:31,755 --> 01:04:33,925
to how long the Parasite
can retain your power...

996
01:04:34,825 --> 01:04:35,860
and weakness.

997
01:04:37,128 --> 01:04:38,729
[whistles]

998
01:04:38,795 --> 01:04:41,531
- [laughs boisterously]
- [roars]

999
01:04:42,232 --> 01:04:43,300
Lobo!

1000
01:04:43,366 --> 01:04:44,801
- [low roar]
- [moans]

1001
01:04:44,869 --> 01:04:46,470
Eat... shit...

1002
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:48,839
bastich...

1003
01:04:48,906 --> 01:04:49,874
No.

1004
01:04:49,941 --> 01:04:52,309
[cackling]

1005
01:05:10,962 --> 01:05:11,863
No.

1006
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:16,333
[gunshots]

1007
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:27,644
[engines whirring]

1008
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:44,427

1010
01:05:51,835 --> 01:05:52,970
[crackling]

1011
01:05:54,304 --> 01:05:56,107
They have to hold their fire!

1012
01:05:56,174 --> 01:05:57,641
It's only
making him stronger!

1013
01:05:57,707 --> 01:06:00,278
I'll make a call,
but we need Lobo's ring.

1014
01:06:00,343 --> 01:06:02,512
If this thing absorbs
all the power from the plant,

1015
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:04,514
it'll become
too strong to take down.

1016
01:06:04,581 --> 01:06:06,316
Then he can't
make it to the plant.

1017
01:06:06,383 --> 01:06:07,784
What are you going to do?

1018
01:06:08,351 --> 01:06:09,686
[crackling]

1019
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:12,890
[roars]

1020
01:06:14,258 --> 01:06:15,692
Give him a weakness.

1021
01:06:15,759 --> 01:06:16,827
[whooshes]

1022
01:06:17,929 --> 01:06:19,063

Hey! Want some more?

1024
01:06:21,364 --> 01:06:22,732
I'm right here!

01:07:17,587 --> 01:07:20,291
Yeah. Yeah. I'm still
holding for the Pentagon.

1036
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:21,926
- [beeps]
- What? Are you...

1037
01:07:21,993 --> 01:07:24,195
That's 45 minutes
on hold, Lane.

1038
01:07:24,262 --> 01:07:25,897
I was almost through!

1039
01:07:25,963 --> 01:07:27,664
City is on lockdown. We're not
allowed to leave the building.

1040
01:07:27,731 --> 01:07:29,733
- But...
- Yeah?

1041
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:31,735
The story is out there.

Need more power?

1046
01:07:52,555 --> 01:07:53,925
Well, come and get it!

1047
01:07:54,524 --> 01:07:55,792

Lex!

1054
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:21,953
See, here's my problem.

1055
01:08:22,019 --> 01:08:22,887
[gun cocking]

1056
01:08:22,954 --> 01:08:24,821
The Parasite
is very powerful.

1057
01:08:24,889 --> 01:08:28,025
But the Superman
is also very powerful.

1058
01:08:28,092 --> 01:08:30,493
Lex, no!

1059
01:08:31,262 --> 01:08:33,463
[growling]

1060
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:35,465
Right now, the man
with the ring

1061
01:08:35,532 --> 01:08:37,667
is the most
powerful of all.

1062
01:08:37,734 --> 01:08:39,971
So, which is
the bigger threat?

1063
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:41,172
[clicks]

1064
01:08:44,141 --> 01:08:48,611
A simple janitor transformed into
a monster by futuristic tech?

1065
01:08:48,678 --> 01:08:50,513
Or the super-powered alien

1066
01:08:51,315 --> 01:08:52,849
lying to humanity

1067
01:08:52,917 --> 01:08:54,986
masquerading
as one of us?

[thudding]

1069
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:02,426
Oh, hell.

01:09:02,492 --> 01:09:04,996
I'll just make
you both my slaves.

01:09:50,673 --> 01:09:52,043
Are you all right?

1086
01:09:54,844 --> 01:09:56,447
But, the Parasite...

1087
01:09:56,514 --> 01:09:58,015
I saw it kill you.

1088
01:09:59,749 --> 01:10:02,086
You saw what
I wanted it to see.

1089
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,055
[growling]

1090
01:10:11,262 --> 01:10:12,463
[growling]

1091
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:13,864
[engine revving]

1092
01:10:16,067 --> 01:10:18,102
- [crashes]
- [tires screech]

1093
01:10:18,169 --> 01:10:19,236
[gasps]

1094
01:10:19,303 --> 01:10:20,603
[indistinct shouting]

1095
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:24,574
[growling]

1096
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:28,913
Those people
are in grave danger.

1097
01:10:36,586 --> 01:10:37,821
[whirring]

1098
01:10:37,888 --> 01:10:40,157
[crying out in pain]

1099
01:10:40,224 --> 01:10:41,559
That ring will kill you.

1100
01:10:41,624 --> 01:10:44,161
I don't know any other way.

1101
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,700
Find one.

1102
01:11:01,178 --> 01:11:02,179
[growling]

1103
01:11:07,885 --> 01:11:09,253
[indistinct chatter]

1104
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,388
Choppers are grounded.
TV crews can't get in.

1105
01:11:16,626 --> 01:11:18,429
[panting]

1106
01:11:18,496 --> 01:11:20,297
[screeching]

1107
01:11:20,364 --> 01:11:22,066
[indistinct shouting]

1108
01:11:28,372 --> 01:11:29,874
[roaring]

1109
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:35,812
[indistinct shouting]

1110
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:41,018
Lois Lane, live at the scene.

1111
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:42,586
We're on foot
and we have a phone,

1112
01:11:42,652 --> 01:11:44,088
so we're live-streaming.

1113
01:11:44,155 --> 01:11:46,157
The military have tried
to keep the crowd back,

1114
01:11:46,223 --> 01:11:48,192
but at this point, we've
got a lot of angry people

1115
01:11:48,259 --> 01:11:49,894
who are ready
to make a stand

1116
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,863
against what they see as
an extra-terrestrial threat.

1117
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:58,668
Superman may be
the only thing

1118
01:11:58,735 --> 01:12:01,005
that stands between
the people of Metropolis

1119
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:02,940
and total annihilation.

1120
01:12:03,007 --> 01:12:05,176
But, if the eyewitness
reports are true,

1121
01:12:05,242 --> 01:12:07,144
the Parasite
can absorb our strength,

1122
01:12:07,211 --> 01:12:09,812
knowledge, our feelings,
our essence...

1123
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,448
[growling]

1124
01:12:12,682 --> 01:12:14,051
Feelings?

1125
01:12:14,885 --> 01:12:16,420
My essence.

1126
01:12:18,189 --> 01:12:19,689
[roaring]

1127
01:12:21,358 --> 01:12:22,593
[Superman yelling] Rudy!

1128
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,028
Rudy Jones!

1129
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:26,096
I know you're still
in there, Rudy.

1130
01:12:26,163 --> 01:12:27,198
[snarls]

1131
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,501
[growling]

1132
01:12:30,568 --> 01:12:32,136
I know you remember me.

1133
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:36,373
And I know if you've
absorbed everything about me,

1134
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,910
then you haven't just gotten
just my powers or my knowledge.

1135
01:12:39,977 --> 01:12:42,812
You've gotten my heart.

1136
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,683
My love for my family
and friends.

1137
01:12:45,748 --> 01:12:47,618
My need to keep them safe.

1138
01:12:47,685 --> 01:12:51,021
Rudy, you are a combat veteran
who served with honor.

1139
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:55,359
[heart beating]

1140
01:12:55,426 --> 01:12:58,429
A proud father
of one in first grade.

1141
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:00,564
<i>Kaylie, right?</i>

1142
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:02,066
<i>And another on the way.</i>

1143
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,369
I'm sorry this
happened to you.

1144
01:13:06,237 --> 01:13:07,871
But, whatever else you are,

1145
01:13:07,938 --> 01:13:10,374
Rudy, whatever you've become,

1146
01:13:10,441 --> 01:13:12,910
I know you're still
the same as me.

1147
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:16,947
You don't really want
anyone to get hurt.

1148
01:13:17,014 --> 01:13:18,249
[indistinct shouting]

1149
01:13:19,984 --> 01:13:21,952
[woman yelling]
What are you doing?

1150
01:13:22,019 --> 01:13:24,088
[Superman] Stop! All of you!

1151
01:13:25,822 --> 01:13:27,790
He's not the alien.

1152
01:13:27,858 --> 01:13:29,159
I am.

1153
01:13:31,428 --> 01:13:33,197
I see the anger in you.

1154
01:13:33,264 --> 01:13:37,901
But, the truth is,
you don't hate aliens.

1155
01:13:37,968 --> 01:13:40,971
You're scared,
terrified of them,

1156
01:13:41,038 --> 01:13:42,973
even when they're not there.

1157
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,174
[growls softly]

1158
01:13:44,241 --> 01:13:45,842
This man's name
is Rudy Jones.

1159
01:13:45,909 --> 01:13:48,479
He's the victim
of a terrible accident.

1160
01:13:49,413 --> 01:13:51,615
But, he was born here.

1161
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:53,050
He's one of you.

1162
01:13:55,586 --> 01:13:57,054
And so am I.

1163
01:14:00,457 --> 01:14:04,261
I was born in the last days
of a dying planet.

1164
01:14:04,328 --> 01:14:06,829
My parents' hope was that
they had sent me to a world

1165
01:14:06,897 --> 01:14:09,033
where I would be
safe and protected.

1166
01:14:09,099 --> 01:14:11,268
But, the price
of that protection,

1167
01:14:11,335 --> 01:14:14,405
silence about who
and what I really am,

1168
01:14:14,471 --> 01:14:18,008
while others like me
face persecution, or worse...

1169
01:14:19,343 --> 01:14:22,179
I was scared,
but I'm not scared anymore.

1170
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:28,252
My name is Kal-El of Krypton.

1171
01:14:29,153 --> 01:14:30,521
And I come in peace.

1172
01:14:40,064 --> 01:14:41,598

[electricity buzzing]

1195
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:16,360
You should have let me
turn the damn thing off.

1196
01:16:18,929 --> 01:16:21,398
[Martian] Superman!
The reactor!

[wind whooshing]

1222
01:19:32,656 --> 01:19:34,458
[Superman] Is that
really you this time?

1223
01:19:34,524 --> 01:19:36,493
Or is it
a telepathic trick?

1224
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:40,898
I've apologized already.

1225
01:19:40,965 --> 01:19:43,901
It bought me the time
I needed to recuperate

1226
01:19:43,968 --> 01:19:46,803
so I could save your ass.

1227
01:19:48,873 --> 01:19:50,140
[Lobo] Better.

1228
01:19:51,408 --> 01:19:55,145
But you still
sound like a dweeb.

1229
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:57,147
You could've mentioned
the immortality.

1230
01:19:57,214 --> 01:19:58,382
[chuckles]

1231
01:19:58,448 --> 01:20:00,817
I like to keep
people guessing.

1232
01:20:03,754 --> 01:20:05,522
Three aliens.

1233
01:20:05,589 --> 01:20:07,491
The last surviving members

1234
01:20:07,557 --> 01:20:09,826
of each of our people.

1235
01:20:09,894 --> 01:20:13,497
Of course I killed
all my peoples myself.

1236
01:20:13,563 --> 01:20:15,699
So, why do I give a shit?

1237
01:20:20,837 --> 01:20:22,974
Nah. [chuckling]

1238
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:26,510
Just kidding. You should
have seen your face, though.

You know those are
just stories, right?

1242

Every rat bastard I hunt

1243
01:20:38,122 --> 01:20:40,190
is the last of his people.

1244
01:20:40,257 --> 01:20:42,994
Something you say
to keep the bounty high.

1245
01:20:43,061 --> 01:20:46,229
Are you saying there are
other Martians out there?

1246
01:20:46,864 --> 01:20:48,832
Hell yeah!

1247
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,902
Seen 'em myself.

1248
01:20:50,968 --> 01:20:53,670
Might even be
a Kryptonian, or two.

[engine revving]

1250
01:20:57,041 --> 01:20:58,642
All right, ladies.

1251
01:20:58,709 --> 01:21:01,445
I gotta take
a big old space dump

1252
01:21:01,511 --> 01:21:03,981
and I don't do it no place
but my own.

1253
01:21:04,048 --> 01:21:05,415
So...

1254
01:21:05,983 --> 01:21:07,784
smell you later!

I really hope
he doesn't come back.

1259
01:21:20,363 --> 01:21:22,033
You should go.

1260
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,266
Follow him.

1261
01:21:24,367 --> 01:21:25,702
Find your people.

1262
01:21:28,305 --> 01:21:29,840
And you, Kal-El.

It's Superman.

01:21:37,247 --> 01:21:38,849
My people are right here.

1267
01:21:47,058 --> 01:21:48,358
[Lois] You... [gasps]

1268
01:21:48,425 --> 01:21:50,460
You couldn't meet me
over by the stairs?

1269
01:21:50,527 --> 01:21:52,662
We're losing
valuable interview time.

1270
01:21:52,729 --> 01:21:54,798
Sorry, Ms. Lane. Not today.

1271
01:21:56,901 --> 01:21:58,035
Call me to reschedule.

1272
01:22:02,405 --> 01:22:03,941
[indistinct chatter]

1273
01:22:14,551 --> 01:22:17,054
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]

1274
01:22:21,092 --> 01:22:22,292
[whooshing]

1275
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:23,827
[man] Way to go, Superman!

1276
01:22:25,963 --> 01:22:27,899
So, how was
the interview, Lois?

1277
01:22:29,666 --> 01:22:31,568
You know what I told you
about power moves, Clark?

1278
01:22:31,635 --> 01:22:33,770
Well, I was right.
They really do work.

1279
01:22:33,837 --> 01:22:35,873
Has anybody
seen my calendar?

1280
01:22:46,692 --> 01:22:51,692
