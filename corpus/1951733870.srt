1
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:27,433
Lila! Lila! Lila!

2
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:32,438
Do you think this will affect
the sales of your book?

3
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:36,431
-Lila, are you sorry you did it?
-l`m not sorry.

4
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:38,444
l am sorry.

5
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,447
l don`t even know
what sorry means anymore.

6
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:47,453
l`m not sorry.

7
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:52,447
So l spend the rest of
my life in jail. So what?

8
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:55,461
l`ve been in jail
my whole life anyway.

9
00:01:56,496 --> 00:02:00,455
Ajail of blood and tissue...
and coursing hormones.

10
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,469
Ajail called the human body.

11
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:09,464
The only thing l know
is that l`m sorry.

12
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:16,472
Sorry for my expulsion. Sorry for
my Lila rotting in herjail cell.

13
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:19,485
And sorry for Nathan...

14
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,489
rotting in his grave.

15
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:29,495
l don`t even know what
sorry means anymore.

16
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:31,497
lt`s odd.

17
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:36,491
When l was alive, l knew.
Maybe it was all l knew.

18
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:38,504
But here...

19
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,499
sorry is meaningless.
Love is meaningless.

20
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:49,504
-Jealousy is meaningless.
-My story begins when l was 1 2.

21
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,517
Jesus.

22
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:54,520
Something terrible happened
that year.

23
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:59,514
My mother said because of it, l
would never be able to get a man.

24
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:04,519
So l should get used to the idea of
dedicating my life to the pursuit...

25
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:07,533
of knowledge or religion
or whatever.

26
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:42,557
lt`s hormonal. Nature is
a funny and complex thing.

27
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:45,571
lt could get worse with time.

28
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:49,564
By the time l was 20,
l looked like an ape.

29
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:04,650
The way that mouse looked at me.

30
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:08,643
lt didn`t care if l had hair
all over my body.

31
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,657
l wasjust what l was.

32
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:15,661
l felt so free.

33
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:20,666
Do you understand
what l`m saying?

34
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,669
Something about a mouse, right?

35
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:28,674
l don`t think there`s anyone in
the world who doesn`t know...

36
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,677
by now that l was raised
in the wilderness by an ape.

37
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:35,670
Well, to be fair, by a man who
thought himself an ape. But...

38
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:39,674
it amounts to the same thing,
gentlemen, does it not?

39
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,688
After spending years in a mental
hospital for attempting to...

40
00:05:42,722 --> 00:05:45,691
take up residence in the ape
house of the local zoo...

41
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:49,684
he did his best to live by your
rules. He got ajob...

42
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:52,698
he married a human,
they had me.

43
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:55,701
Until a national tragedy undid
all those years of therapy...

44
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:59,694
and reminded him what the
human race was truly about.

45
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,699
Apes don`t assassinate their
presidents, gentlemen.

46
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:17,712
So, he stole little me
from my human mother...

47
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:22,717
and raised me with love and
tenderness and respect.

48
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:28,723
Until quite recently gentlemen,
l believed myself to be an ape.

49
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:30,736
Although, l didn`t know
specifically what type.

50
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,729
Apes don`t think in terms of type.
lt might be argued, gentlemen...

51
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:37,743
that apes don`t even know
they`re apes.

52
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:44,739
ln retrospect, however,
l`d say l was a...

53
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,754
pygmy chimp.

54
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:01,767
l have to say
l always hated apes.

55
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:04,770
Of course, l don`t any longer.

56
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:09,764
Now l don`t even know
what hate means.

57
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:12,778
But while alive, l hated apes.

58
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:14,780
l blame my parents.

59
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:17,783
l mean, l don`t blame them.

60
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:21,776
l don`t know what blame is
really, anymore, but...

61
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:26,781
l think they influenced me
in my ape-hating tendencies.

62
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:29,795
Mama, look! Monkey!

63
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:33,788
Nathan, chimpanzees are apes,
not monkeys.

64
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,803
And furthermore, Harold,
tell the boy.

65
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,807
Tell him, Harold.

66
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:47,802
The ape is our closest
biological relative.

67
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:52,807
Specifically...
the pygmy chimp.

68
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:57,812
A single chromosome separates us.
But do you know what...

69
00:07:57,857 --> 00:08:00,826
-truly separates us?
-No, Papa, what?

70
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,820
Civilization. Without it, we
might as well be living in pens...

71
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:07,833
throwing our feces...

72
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:14,829
masturbating in public, sniffing
red, swollen female rump.

73
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:19,845
Your adoptive father and l
whisked you away from a life...

74
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,839
that most certainly would`ve been
one of degradation and alcoholism.

75
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:28,843
Your part of the bargain is
to never wallow...

76
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:33,848
in the filth of instinct.
Any dumb animal can do that.

77
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:35,861
An animal saved my life...

78
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:39,854
so l decided to go live
among them in the forest.

79
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,859
You see, animals have eyes
hat don`tjudge.

80
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,880
Look at all the hair,
everywhere, everywhere.

81
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:11,886
On the possum and the woodchuck
and the cuddly old bear.

82
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:17,892
l used to be embarrassed of hair.
Not fit to caress.

83
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,907
Now, l`m so sure
it`s a blessing...

84
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:24,910
l`ve got no need of dressing.

85
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:32,907
I once thought God
A Creator diaboIicaI

86
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:38,913
He gave the nod
To each one of my foIIicIes

87
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,918
Head to my baby toe

88
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:50,925
Now I`m free
No more cares

89
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,930
I`ve accepted
My miIIions of hairs

90
00:09:55,975 --> 00:10:01,936
My new friends
These spIit ends

91
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:06,941
Far away from
Those terribIe stares

92
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:12,947
SquirreIs don`t mind
Nor do ravens

93
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:17,952
If a girI is furred
Or cIean-shaven

94
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:23,958
Creatures are kind so I have
Found my new green haven

95
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:28,963
And I ain`t gonna go

96
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:37,973
`Cause I`m one of them
You know

97
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:47,993
l figured out a way to stay
in the woods forever.

98
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:53,988
l became a nature writer.
Last night, on my mountaintop...

99
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:57,992
l felt the wind whip
through my hair.

100
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,010
lt was violent.

101
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:08,013
l almost died.

102
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:14,008
All my petty concerns were sent
flying with those gale force winds.

103
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:17,022
l was in nature.
l was nature!

104
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:21,015
An otter, a stork, an oak tree.

105
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:26,031
A woman.

106
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:29,034
When l became a famous nature
writer, l said to myself...

107
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:33,027
``Fuck humanity.`` l never saw my
public, l never saw my publisher.

108
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:37,031
l never saw another human being
and it was wonderful.

109
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,048
But l have to admit by the time
l was 30, l was very horny.

110
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:46,051
l had to have a man in my life.

111
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:04,058
l would become what l needed
to become to achieve this.

112
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:10,064
My success would allow me to
afford to become a hairless lie.

113
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:19,084
-Progress!
-Yeah?

114
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:23,077
Yeah. Honey, you are getting
smooth, smooth, smooth all over.

115
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:26,091
-Smooth as a baby`s butt.
-l love it, Louise.

116
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,094
-l`m getting like a real girl.
-You still in the market for...

117
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,096
-a real boy?
-Always.

118
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:36,090
`Cause my brother knows this guy.
Might be right up your alley.

119
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,103
Tell me. l could use
someone up my alley.

120
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:40,105
l don`t get that.
Something sexual?

121
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:42,107
Shut up and tell me.

122
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:46,111
-Handsome, 30`s, psychologist.
-Loves animals?

123
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:49,114
-Must love animals, Louise.
-Loves animals. Loves you.

124
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:51,116
What do you mean?

125
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,109
Well, somehow it came up that
you`re a friend of mine...

126
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:58,123
and Mr. Handsome Animal-loving
Psychologist said...

127
00:12:58,157 --> 00:13:02,116
-that he would love to meet you.
-Won`t he be able to tell?

128
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:06,131
My brother says the guy`s a
35-year-old virgin.

129
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:09,134
So, maybe he won`t know how
a woman usually feels.

130
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:12,137
Plus, he has bad eyesight.
Almost legally blind.

131
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:15,140
Which is very helpful in this
situation. Plus...

132
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:19,133
he has an extremely small penis of
which he is mortifyingly ashamed.

133
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:21,146
And chances are...

134
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,149
he will be so grateful for any
non-judgmental attention...

135
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:28,142
-he will be yours forever.
-He must be really close...

136
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:30,155
to your brother to tell him
such personal stuff.

137
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:33,158
Oh, yeah.
My brother`s his shrink.

138
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:36,161
-Fuck Humanity`s a delightful read.
-Thank you so much.

139
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:40,154
-Yes, l`m a real animal lover.
-l work with animals.

140
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:42,167
Right now...

141
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:46,171
l`m teaching mice...
well...

142
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:50,175
table manners, to be candid.

143
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:57,171
-And how`s it going?
-l hope you don`t think me daft.

144
00:13:57,216 --> 00:14:00,185
lt`s important work. lt`s part of
a larger sociological experiment.

145
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:04,178
-l`m federally funded.
-What`s the larger experiment?

146
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:07,192
My thesis is that courtesy,
decorum, manners are all...

147
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:10,195
sadly lacking from our daily
intercourse. Rudeness and...

148
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:14,188
vulgarity are the norm. Ergo,
if l can teach table manners...

149
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:16,201
to mice, then l can
teach them to humans.

150
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:22,196
And if l can teach table manners
to humans, then maybe... l can...

151
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:25,210
make the world
a little bit safer.

152
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:29,203
Lord, thank You for this bountiful
gift we are about to receive.

153
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:31,216
Amen.

154
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:35,220
Oh, God, Nathan. No.

155
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:41,215
That`s the wrong fork, young man.
Harold, tell him.

156
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:45,230
-lt`s the wrong fork.
-l`m sorry.

157
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:47,232
l`ll use the right one.
l forgot.

158
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:50,235
Harold.

159
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,238
Tell him.

160
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:59,244
lt`s too late.
You`ll have to go to your room.

161
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:11,245
And do you think, maybe, this...

162
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,259
early childhood indoctrination
has something to do with...

163
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:17,262
your interest in table manners
in the present?

164
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:23,268
Seems a tad convenient,
don`t you think, Wendall?

165
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:27,261
Well, do you have any thoughts
then on where this passion...

166
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:30,275
-might`ve come from?
-lt`s my work.

167
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,269
You can`t reduce my passion
to parental indoctrination.

168
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:40,274
Why did Picasso paint?
Why did Mozart compose?

169
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:45,279
Picasso`s father was a painter.
Mozart`s father was a musician.

170
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:49,283
Yes, okay. Now you`re being nasty.
Now you`rejust showing off.

171
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:51,296
l really didn`t come
here to be mocked.

172
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,298
Well, that certainly
wasn`t my intention.

173
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:56,301
lt`s my work, Wendall.
That`s all.

174
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:05,370
Voil.

175
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:16,381
This looks wonderful.

176
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:19,384
You look wonderful.

177
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:25,390
l`m on top of the world
tonight, Lila.

178
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:30,384
My work is going splendidly
and my personal life...

179
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:36,401
The fork. Fork!

180
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,404
l`m sorry?

181
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:44,398
lt`sjust...the outside fork
is usually the salad fork.

182
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:49,403
-One goes from the outside in.
-Oh, l`m sorry. l never really...

183
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:52,417
-learned these things.
-lt`s no biggie.

184
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:55,420
Oh, boy, this is good.

185
00:17:55,454 --> 00:18:00,414
-l`m sorry if l became upset.
-No, l`m sorry.

186
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,428
l`m a little backwards
in some ways.

187
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:06,431
lt`sjust that l really
enjoy your company.

188
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:08,433
-You do?
-Yes.

189
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:13,438
Please, Lila.

190
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:18,432
Please don`t talk when
you have food in your mouth.

191
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:23,437
You`re so pretty,
and it only mars your....

192
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:25,450
l`m being critical.

193
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,458
l can`t believe
you think l`m pretty.

194
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:35,460
l have some peculiarities,
you see.

195
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:37,462
-l think you`re pretty, too.
-You do?

196
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:41,455
Yes, l really do. And l have
peculiarities, also.

197
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,469
Well, l don`t care. l don`t care.

198
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,472
-No?
-No.

199
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:50,475
Like what, for example?

200
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:57,482
Like.... Nothing.

201
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:13,498
l cannot believe how in love
with this man l am.

202
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:18,492
Louise, he`s so cute.
Even his little penis.

203
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:22,496
lt`s like a little pig`s penis
or something. lt`s charming.

204
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,509
Well, you`ve always
been an animal lover.

205
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,512
-He`s gonna find out, Lou.
-You`re a wonderful woman.

206
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:30,515
-He`s lucky to have you.
-Louise...

207
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:33,518
you`re removing hair from
my feet as you say that.

208
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:36,521
So you have a physical quirk.
Big deal.

209
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:40,514
l`ll tell you what l fall in love
with in a man...his mind, period.

210
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,528
-There`s a limit.
-No, period. End of sentence...

211
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:46,531
end of paragraph,
close the book, we`re done.

212
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:48,533
me a man with intellect,
like my brother.

213
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,536
l know he`s average looking,
but he`s so smart. You know?

214
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,538
l could care less
about the packaging.

215
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:56,541
-You don`t fuck the packaging.
-Yeah, you do.

216
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:59,544
You fuck the mind, Lila.
You fuck the mind, period.

217
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:02,547
Close the book, end the sentence,
close the whatever.

218
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:08,542
Hey. l have a really smart friend
for you. He has an l.Q. of 1 70.

219
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:11,556
-What`s he look like?
-Oh, he`s gorgeous.

220
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:17,551
-He`s sort of a midget.
-Jesus, Lila.

221
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:20,565
l`m not dating a fucking midget.

222
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:25,559
What is love anyway? From my new
vantage point, l realize that...

223
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:30,564
love is nothing more than a messy
conglomeration of need...

224
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:35,569
desperation, fear of death
and insecurity about penis size.

225
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:42,577
But l`m notjudging it. l know
how miserable it is to be alive.

226
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:45,590
Listen...

227
00:20:45,624 --> 00:20:51,585
l don`t want to be dead yet.
ls there any way to...

228
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:54,599
Hello?

229
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:00,605
No, l suppose not.

230
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:05,610
No biggie.

231
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:10,604
Anyway, Lila moved in.
We had our problems...

232
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:15,609
but we both wanted love so badly,
we turned a blind eye.

233
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:18,623
Like the first time l brought
Lila to meet my parents.

234
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:21,626
lt`s lovely to finally meet you,
Mr. and Mrs. Bronfman.

235
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,619
Nathan`s told me so much about
you. All good things, of course.

236
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:27,632
Thank you, dear.

237
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:36,630
l`m sorry, will somebody please
tell me who this little boy is?

238
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:40,634
Your father and l have adopted
an additional son.

239
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:46,651
Waynejust returned
from a week at Peace Camp...

240
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:49,654
and a week at Science Camp. Tell
everyone what you`ve learned.

241
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:54,648
Conflict resolution and
flatworm dissection.

242
00:21:56,695 --> 00:22:01,655
-Very nice to meet you, Wayne.
-Nice to meet you. Our mom`s...

243
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,660
-told me so much about you.
-Yes, l wish l could say the same.

244
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:10,675
By the way, his elbow
is on the table.

245
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,679
-Good boy.
-Good boy? That`s it? Good boy?

246
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:17,682
You shouldn`t be speaking to your
mother in that tone of voice.

247
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:21,675
Forgive me, but it seems to me that
Wayne needs a tad more disci--

248
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,688
Sorry, Mom.
l don`t know where my head was.

249
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:27,681
Wayne is quite
self-disciplined for his age.

250
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:31,685
-Meaning?
-He does seem very disciplined.

251
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,698
But l wonder, do you think it`s
the best thing for a child--

252
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:36,701
Lila`s a nature writer, Mother.
Did you know that?

253
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:39,704
She writes about animals and
nature and other things...

254
00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:44,698
about nature in addition to that.
Wind, animals, what have you.

255
00:22:44,743 --> 00:22:46,711
Squirrels.

256
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:49,714
l love nature.

257
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,709
As long as it stays in the zoo
where it belongs.

258
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:06,731
l hate Wayne. Don`t you?

259
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:11,725
Listen. l`m sorry about my
mother`s reaction to your work.

260
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,739
-What are you doing in there?
-You didn`t seem sorry when...

261
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:18,732
you were laughing at her endless
stupid, cruel animal jokes.

262
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:21,746
l was simply attempting to
keep the evening light.

263
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,749
You know l feel similarly
to you about nature.

264
00:23:24,783 --> 00:23:28,742
-Do you?
-Oh, yes. Of course. l love it.

265
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:32,746
-Do you? Oh, do you, darling?
-lt`s my favorite, nature.

266
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:38,763
l`m so relieved.

267
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:41,766
Let`s celebrate tomorrow with
a long hike in the woods.

268
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,769
Oh, what a great idea.

269
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:53,778
That shaving cream?

270
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:57,782
l don`t think so.

271
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:01,786
Why?

272
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:11,796
Then, gentlemen, one day l saw
something l hadn`t seen since...

273
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,790
my father`s death.
l saw other apes.

274
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:20,805
They chattered away in
what seemed to be gibberish.

275
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,808
Later, l learned it was English.

276
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:29,803
Now l wonder if perhaps my initial
assessment hadn`t been correct.

277
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:42,827
l saw a flash of white.

278
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:45,830
-Did you see that?
-What?

279
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:48,833
-l don`t know. Something.
-A deer?

280
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:53,827
No, too upright.
A person?

281
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:58,832
lt might behoove us
to turn back at this point.

282
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:07,841
lf it`s a person,
why should we go see it?

283
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:10,855
lt`s not like it`s nature.

284
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:16,850
Lila, people who live in the
woods don`t want to be seen.

285
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:18,863
We should respect their wishes.

286
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:25,870
This is how you get ticks.

287
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:28,873
This is it. Lyme disease.

288
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,879
For God`s sake, what are you--

289
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:53,887
An ape as l had never seen before.
Like me, yet different.

290
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:56,901
And all at once l felt
a heat pass through me.

291
00:25:56,935 --> 00:25:59,904
Gentlemen, l wanted to touch her,
caress her, to be one with her.

292
00:25:59,938 --> 00:26:03,897
l had urges l could not explain.

293
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:11,905
And so l did what any animal
would do in that situation.

294
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:14,919
He bolted.

295
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:18,983
Who are you?

296
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:27,981
You don`t understand my
language, do you?

297
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:58,022
Now look what you`ve done.
ls he dead?

298
00:27:58,056 --> 00:28:00,024
-No.
-Please put something on.

299
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:03,027
lt`s cold, you`ll catch a cold.
What do you suppose he is...

300
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:06,030
-a survivalist?
-l think he`s feral.

301
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:09,033
Feral? Oh, don`t touch him.
He might be diseased.

302
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,035
Oh, my God, rabies!

303
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:14,038
-He looks perfectly fine.
-My God, l think we should go.

304
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:17,041
Nathan, l don`t understand you.
This is fascinating.

305
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:22,035
Here`s a human being, totally
uncontaminated by civilization.

306
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,049
And all you want to
do is run to the car.

307
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:30,043
-You`re starting to annoy me.
-Forget the mice.

308
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:34,047
Forget guinea pigs.
Forget cats. Monkeys, too.

309
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:37,061
l`m on to stage five,
the human subject.

310
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:38,062
No.

311
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:41,065
l can change him.
l can teach him.

312
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:44,068
l can save this unfortunate
man`s life!

313
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:47,071
l won`t let you, it`s wrong.
He`s happy here.

314
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:50,074
Happy? ls he happy? Never to
know the love of a good woman.

315
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:54,067
Never to read Moby Dick
or marvel at a Monet.

316
00:28:56,114 --> 00:29:00,073
You`d be taking away his freedom.

317
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:04,077
Freedom`sjust another word
for nothing left to lose, Lila.

318
00:29:44,162 --> 00:29:46,130
Doctor?

319
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:56,140
Good morning.

320
00:31:04,242 --> 00:31:06,210
Only three shocks.

321
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:10,203
A chimp takes 15. This is going
to be trs simple, no, Gabrielle?

322
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:13,217
-Oui, doctor.
-Good morning.

323
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:18,211
-We need to give him a name.
-Oui.

324
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:24,217
-You decide. Today is your day.
-Really? My day?

325
00:31:25,263 --> 00:31:31,224
l had a sweet little mongrel dog
named Puff when l was a girl.

326
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:32,236
Puff.

327
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:37,230
This one reminds me of my dog.
All shaggy. So cute.

328
00:31:37,275 --> 00:31:40,244
l loved my doggie
very much, Monsieur.

329
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:42,246
Puff it is, then.

330
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,248
-Puff Bronfman. ls that okay?
-Oui, perfect.

331
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:49,242
Good morning, Puff Bronfman.
My name is Dr. Bronfman...

332
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:54,247
and this is my assistant,
Gabrielle.

333
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:57,261
We`re your mommy and
daddy while you`re here.

334
00:31:57,295 --> 00:32:01,254
Would you like some salad, son?

335
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:08,261
-Dr. Bronfman! Dr. Bronfman!
-Hi, Gabrielle.

336
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:13,266
l just wanted to tell you that l
very much enjoy working with you.

337
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:16,280
Now l`m embarrassed
that l say this.

338
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:20,273
No, no. Don`t be.
l really enjoyed hearing that.

339
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:24,277
-You`re a terrific assistant.
-Merci.

340
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:30,283
Would you like to go
get a cup of coffee, perhaps?

341
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,289
Well, l don`t know.

342
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:42,295
-Actually, l`m on my way to....
-Now l am truly embarrassed.

343
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,299
Forgive me. l should not have
asked such a stupid question.

344
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:50,303
-You`re a very important man.
-Don`t be silly.

345
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:52,316
You`re so sweet.

346
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,328
There, there.

347
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:07,331
You know just the right
thing to say to me.

348
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:13,326
l see you tomorrow, okay?
Unless.... Am l fired now?

349
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:16,340
No. Of course not, Gabrielle.

350
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:23,336
l like it when you say my name.
ls that stupid?

351
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:30,354
Hello?

352
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:33,357
Hi, Gabrielle.

353
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:38,351
-Yes, right, Gabrielle.
-Who is it?

354
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:42,355
-Who is it?
-Someone from work.

355
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,359
l think you took the right
initiative, Gabrielle.

356
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:52,365
lt shows you to be very wise.
Oh, really? Gabrielle....

357
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,369
Could you hold on just
one minute, please?

358
00:33:57,415 --> 00:34:02,375
-Who is it, Nathan?
-l am on a work call... and l--

359
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:07,391
Nathan, l--

360
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:11,384
lt`s hormonal.
l can`t help it.

361
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:15,388
-Your entire body?
-I`m doing eIectroIysis.

362
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:17,401
It takes time. It`s working, but
in the meantime I have to shave-

363
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:21,394
-You have to shave? Like an ape?
-Apes don`t shave...

364
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:23,407
-you son of a bitch!
-Don`t quibbIe...

365
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:26,410
-you know what I mean.
-PIease don`t be mad at me.

366
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:29,413
-I`m not mad, I`m disgusted.
-I`m the same person.

367
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:34,407
I have to think.
I have to go.

368
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:46,430
HeIIo? Is anybody there?

369
00:34:58,476 --> 00:35:02,435
No, thank you.
I couIdn`t eat another bite.

370
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,439
It is IoveIy to make
your acquaintance.

371
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:10,443
My apoIogies, madam.
It shan`t happen again.

372
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:13,457
-My compIiments to the chef.
-``ldiopathic hirsutism occurs...

373
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:15,459
in women who have hair follicles
highly sensitive to...

374
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:18,462
normal female androgen levels.``

375
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,469
How could l find myself
in this mess?

376
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:29,462
ls my girlfriend a man?
No. But she deceived me.

377
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:31,475
She has hair,
she`s not supposed to.

378
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:35,468
Oh, doctor! l did not know.
l`m sorry to disturb you.

379
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:38,482
l just came for
some papers l left.

380
00:35:38,516 --> 00:35:43,476
Sorry l startled you,
l just came to think.

381
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:48,492
-My God, did l hang up on you?
-Oui.

382
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:50,494
Perhaps l called at a bad time?

383
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:54,487
-l am sorry.
-l`m sorry. l was distracted.

384
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:56,500
-ls everything fine?
-Oui.

385
00:35:57,535 --> 00:36:00,504
Now you`ve got me talking French.

386
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:04,508
l was in my p.j.`s when l
remembered l left some papers...

387
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:08,501
l need to go over. See?
l rushed right out of the house.

388
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:11,515
-l must look a mess.
-No, not at all.

389
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:13,517
l`m in my p.j.`s, too.

390
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:16,520
Funny, huh?

391
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:20,524
And how is our son?

392
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,529
-What?
-Our son.

393
00:36:25,563 --> 00:36:27,531
Puff.

394
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:32,536
He seems fine. l guess
we woke him up with the lights.

395
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,539
l should turn them off.

396
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:43,536
Maybe l sing him a lullaby
my mama sang to me...

397
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:46,550
when l was a little girl.

398
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:50,543
-When you`re a little French girl?
-But of course, silly.

399
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:57,551
That might be very soothing...
for him to hear that.

400
00:37:20,618 --> 00:37:24,577
Can you point me to
the Cezanne exhibit?

401
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:40,593
There.
Shall we close up, then?

402
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:46,610
l shouldn`t say this, but...

403
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:50,603
-you`re a pretty girl, Gabrielle.
-Really?

404
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:54,607
-l always think of myself so ugly.
-No.

405
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:57,621
Well, no, not ugly, but plain.
A wallflower.

406
00:37:57,655 --> 00:38:00,624
Not at all. You`re a very pretty
girl. You should know that.

407
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:05,618
-You should be confident.
-Thank you so much. Merci.

408
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:08,632
lt is too wonderful to hear a
man say such a nice compliment.

409
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:12,625
-lt`s true. l wouldn`t lie.
-You are sweet to me.

410
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:19,643
So soft.

411
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:22,646
-Doctor....
-l`m sorry.

412
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:06,679
l saw it, gentlemen. l saw the
whole sweaty, passionate...

413
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:12,685
ugly, beautiful act.
And to use the vernacular...

414
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:15,699
l wanted me some of that.

415
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:25,698
And l think l understood
from that moment...

416
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:31,704
that in order to get some,
l would have to play their game.

417
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:58,742
Excellent, Puff, excellent.
Excellent.

418
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:04,737
Now, the lady you`re with excuses
herself to go powder her nose.

419
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:27,760
-Perfect, Puff, perfect.
-Bravo.

420
00:40:39,817 --> 00:40:43,776
l still feel guilt, even dead.

421
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:46,790
One would have hoped that....

422
00:40:49,827 --> 00:40:52,796
You know, l really did love Lila.

423
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:59,792
lt`sjust that with her problem
and then when Gabrielle...

424
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:06,800
revealed her feelings, l... She
wasjust so conventionally female.

425
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:09,813
She had that accent.

426
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:15,808
l... l was lost from then on.

427
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:18,822
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan

428
00:41:18,856 --> 00:41:21,825
l`m sorry to ask
but l need to know.

429
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,819
-Of course not.
-lt would be helpful to know.

430
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:27,831
No.

431
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:31,835
Because, you know, lately,
you seem so distant.

432
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:34,838
You work late every night and we
hardly ever have sex...

433
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:36,840
and when we do, it`s...

434
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:41,845
-different.
-l`ve been preoccupied lately.

435
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:47,851
Do you like my new look?

436
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,859
-lt`s nice.
-Really?

437
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:59,852
l`m trying, you know.
l`m trying to be what you want.

438
00:41:59,897 --> 00:42:01,865
l want to be what
you want me to be, Nathan.

439
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:04,868
All l want is to be
what you want.

440
00:42:05,903 --> 00:42:08,872
-You`re exactly what l want.
-Really?

441
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:13,866
Sure.
Of course.

442
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:15,879
l`m really trying.
You know what?

443
00:42:15,913 --> 00:42:19,872
Louise said that l only have
two more years of electrolysis.

444
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:21,885
-That`s great.
-And l signed up for ballet class.

445
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:25,878
Look at my nails.
Like a real girl!

446
00:42:25,923 --> 00:42:31,884
-That`s a great color on you.
-Oh, Nathan, let`s have a baby.

447
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:47,911
So that`s the nightmare l`ve been ha

448
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:52,905
for the life of me,
figure out what it`s about.

449
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:58,911
-l think it may be about Lila.
-Lila? How?

450
00:42:58,956 --> 00:43:01,925
Ever since she broached the
subject of children you`ve been...

451
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:05,918
on edge, and l know you have
an issue with her body hair.

452
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:08,932
l see that.
That`s something to consider.

453
00:43:08,966 --> 00:43:11,935
l felt it had more to do with
child-rearing concerns.

454
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:14,938
The monkey-baby representing
parenta...

455
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:18,931
l think it`s important that you
look at your feelings for Lila.

456
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:20,944
Well, l love Lila.

457
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:27,941
She`s wonderful. And she loves
me. That`s no small potatoes.

458
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:33,946
And she`s a good person.
That`s pretty rare in this world.

459
00:43:35,993 --> 00:43:37,961
How could l stop loving someone...

460
00:43:37,995 --> 00:43:40,964
because of a little
physical imperfection?

461
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:47,961
-lf it can even be called that.
-How do you feel about Gabrielle?

462
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:56,969
Good evening...
ladies...

463
00:43:57,014 --> 00:44:01,974
and gentle...
men!

464
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:08,981
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

465
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:11,995
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

466
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:15,988
Bravo, Puff, bravo!
lsn`t Puff doing spectacularly?

467
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:19,002
Nathan, we have to talk,
you and l.

468
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:29,001
-My little French poodle.
-Stop, get away.

469
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:31,014
-What is it?
-You have to choose.

470
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:35,007
lt is like Sophie`s Choice.
Only it is Nathan`s Choice.

471
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:39,011
Did you ever see that movie,
Sophie`s Choice? lt is like that.

472
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:41,024
Only it is this.

473
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:48,020
-l`m trying to sort things out.
-lt is now that you must decide!

474
00:44:49,066 --> 00:44:53,025
l love you, Dr. Nathan.

475
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:59,031
But l will not wait.
l will not be your chippy...

476
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:03,035
your little Mademoiselle
Parlez-vous side dish.

477
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:10,042
l want to have...
a sweet, tiny baby...

478
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:16,048
inside my belly... from you.

479
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:32,075
l love you so much, Gabrielle.

480
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:38,070
But? But?
There is a ``but,`` Nathan.

481
00:45:39,116 --> 00:45:43,075
l don`t know how to leave Lila.

482
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:52,095
Goodbye, Nathan.

483
00:45:52,129 --> 00:45:56,088
Oh, Nathan.
l`m so happy!

484
00:45:56,133 --> 00:46:00,092
l know everything`s
going to bejust great.

485
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:06,109
Voil.

486
00:46:09,146 --> 00:46:11,114
-Voil.
-Thanks.

487
00:46:17,154 --> 00:46:23,115
-How`s work?
-Cruddy. You satisfied?

488
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:28,131
l don`t want your work
to be cruddy.

489
00:46:31,168 --> 00:46:36,128
l`m sorry.
My assistant quit today.

490
00:46:37,174 --> 00:46:41,133
He was highly valuable
to the project.

491
00:46:41,178 --> 00:46:44,147
Oh, baby, l`m so sorry.

492
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:49,141
-Can you find somebody else?
-l guess. Whatever.

493
00:46:51,188 --> 00:46:55,147
l could come work for you.
l know l haven`t been that...

494
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:58,161
supportive of the project,
but l`ve come around.

495
00:46:58,195 --> 00:47:00,163
lt`s a wonderful project.
You taking that...

496
00:47:00,197 --> 00:47:05,157
poor, uncivilized creature and
turning him into a human being.

497
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:08,171
What a compassionate,
kind man you are.

498
00:47:08,205 --> 00:47:13,165
-l had sold my fucking soul.
-l let her sell her soul.

499
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:18,170
l stood by as she did it.
lt`s inexcusable.

500
00:47:18,215 --> 00:47:21,184
At the time, though, l thought
it might be good for her.

501
00:47:21,218 --> 00:47:24,187
When she came to work with Nathan,
gentlemen, she seemed different.

502
00:47:24,221 --> 00:47:28,180
l don`t know, somehow...
soulless.

503
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:04,227
Bravo!

504
00:48:07,264 --> 00:48:11,223
-Bravo to you, Puff.
-Bravo!

505
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:19,231
Tame me, doctor.
Tame your little monkey of love.

506
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:33,246
-Well, l`m tamed, Dr. Bronfman.
-l`m glad... my assistant.

507
00:48:56,313 --> 00:48:58,281
Thank you.

508
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:04,287
l`ll start today with
the foie gras.

509
00:49:14,331 --> 00:49:18,290
-l gotta crow
-l gotta crow

510
00:49:20,337 --> 00:49:24,296
l gotta crow

511
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:28,300
-and raised to the highest
of cuIture and refinement.

512
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:33,305
This is a priceIess gift bestowed
upon me by Dr. Nathan Bronfman.

513
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,318
-End of tape 43.
-l think he`s ready.

514
00:49:35,352 --> 00:49:37,320
Oh, boy!

515
00:49:37,354 --> 00:49:39,322
Oh, boy.

516
00:49:39,356 --> 00:49:42,325
Now, Puff, we`re leaving
the electric collar on.

517
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,328
l don`t think we`ll need
to shock you, butjust in case.

518
00:49:45,362 --> 00:49:48,331
Okay. That`s fair.

519
00:50:25,402 --> 00:50:28,371
Congratulations.

520
00:50:30,407 --> 00:50:34,366
-Oh, thank you.
-No, Puff bad!

521
00:50:42,419 --> 00:50:46,378
-My apologies, madam.
-lt`s all right, Puff.

522
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:48,391
lt shan`t happen again.

523
00:50:54,431 --> 00:50:56,399
Shall we?

524
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:41,433
This is great, Puff.
You`re doing fine.

525
00:51:41,478 --> 00:51:46,438
l`m loving this. lt`s such a
treat to be out and about.

526
00:51:47,484 --> 00:51:51,443
What a wonderful invention the
city is, the immense buildings...

527
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:54,457
of glass and steel glinting
in the afternoon sun...

528
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:58,450
the smartly dressed women in
their best summer frocks...

529
00:51:58,495 --> 00:52:02,454
-the colorful street vendors.
-How is everything?

530
00:52:02,499 --> 00:52:05,468
Just spectacular. Great salmon.
Fantastico!

531
00:52:05,502 --> 00:52:08,471
You`ve got to give me the recipe.
My compliments to the chef!

532
00:52:08,505 --> 00:52:12,464
l`m glad you like it.
The chef will be very... pleased.

533
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:23,486
So, will that be all?

534
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,489
lt shan`t happen again, l swear.

535
00:52:26,523 --> 00:52:28,491
l`m just getting my sea legs,
you know?

536
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:31,494
lt`s an animal urge, Puff.
lt`s nothing to be ashamed of.

537
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:33,496
Lila!

538
00:52:34,531 --> 00:52:37,500
-Tell him.
-You have to control it.

539
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:39,502
We`re not monkeys.

540
00:52:40,537 --> 00:52:42,505
Lila?

541
00:52:57,554 --> 00:53:00,523
Good, you`re doing fine.

542
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:08,520
You`re doing very nicely, Puff.
l`m pleased.

543
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,538
Excellent.

544
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:21,544
Great.

545
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:12,584
Excellent work, Puff.
Extra dessert tonight.

546
00:54:12,629 --> 00:54:16,588
Tomorrow, the acid test.

547
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:28,611
-How y`all doing today?
-Very well.

548
00:54:28,645 --> 00:54:32,604
-Very well.
-Good enough. What can l get you?

549
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:35,618
Puff, why don`t you order first?

550
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:39,622
-What`s a Reuben, please?
-What`s a what, sweetheart?

551
00:54:39,656 --> 00:54:43,615
A Reuben. That`s a sandwich with
corned beef and sauerkraut-

552
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,628
Fine! That`s what l`ll have.
Corned beef is a good...

553
00:54:45,662 --> 00:54:49,621
decent meat. Someone else
please go now, please.

554
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:52,635
l`ll have the big basket.

555
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,638
l`m proud of you, Puff.

556
00:54:55,672 --> 00:54:57,640
You did remarkably well under
difficult circumstances.

557
00:54:57,674 --> 00:55:00,643
-Absolutely.
-Did l?

558
00:55:00,677 --> 00:55:04,636
l tried so hard! l really
concentrated! Oh, l`m so happy!

559
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:07,650
And because you did so well, we
have a little surprise for you.

560
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:10,653
-Extra dessert?
-Even better.

561
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:17,660
Surprise!

562
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:39,671
Free to come and go as you
please. There`s even some...

563
00:55:39,716 --> 00:55:44,676
``mad money`` in the night
table drawer for you.

564
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:49,681
lt`s wonderful! Do you think
l`m ready, do you really?

565
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:53,685
l trust you`ll make good,
mature decisions.

566
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:56,699
l trust you`ll do
the proper thing.

567
00:55:59,736 --> 00:56:03,695
l will. Your very trust has
instilled an enormous sense...

568
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,709
of responsibility in me.
l don`t want to disappoint you.

569
00:56:06,743 --> 00:56:08,711
Good. Remember, when in doubt...

570
00:56:08,745 --> 00:56:10,713
don`t ever do
what you really want to do.

571
00:56:10,747 --> 00:56:15,707
-That`s the key.
-Got it.

572
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:18,721
Oh, sorry, darling!

573
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:23,726
When some things are known...

574
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,720
of which, the one inheres in the
other or is IocaIIy distanced-

575
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:32,735
-reIated in some way
to the other...

576
00:56:32,769 --> 00:56:35,738
the mind straightaway knows by
virtue of that simpIe...

577
00:56:35,772 --> 00:56:39,731
apprehension of those things,
whether the thing inheres or...

578
00:56:39,776 --> 00:56:42,745
does not inhere, whether it-

579
00:56:45,782 --> 00:56:49,741
l`m going to go down and check
on Puff. See how he`s holding up.

580
00:56:49,786 --> 00:56:52,755
-Should l come?
-Nah, you just relax.

581
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:55,758
-How`s the book?
-Mmm, good.

582
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:57,760
l won`t be long.

583
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:08,760
Forget it! Maybe l`ll just stay
here and get shitfaced again.

584
00:57:08,805 --> 00:57:11,774
-That`s a cIassy idea.
-lt passes the time, doesn`t it?

585
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:17,769
-Yeah, what?
-Hi, it`s Nathan.

586
00:57:17,814 --> 00:57:20,783
Call you back.

587
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:28,780
-You bastard! What do you want?
-Just want to talk.

588
00:57:28,825 --> 00:57:31,794
You have made your decision,
Mr. Stinky American.

589
00:57:31,828 --> 00:57:35,787
-l`ve got some things to tell you.
-Like what?

590
00:57:35,832 --> 00:57:38,801
l think it would be easier if l
could talk to you face to face.

591
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:40,803
-What for?
-Well, l think--

592
00:57:40,837 --> 00:57:42,805
You think too much!
All you are is one big thing...

593
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:45,808
with lots of thinks in it!
Full of thinks!

594
00:57:45,842 --> 00:57:48,811
So many thinks that you have
nothing to think at all!

595
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:51,814
-What?
-You heard me.

596
00:57:51,848 --> 00:57:54,817
You make me want to be sick
when you pretend that...

597
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:59,811
you don`t understand what l am
saying to you. Go away from here!

598
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,819
-l`m sorry to have bothered you.
-All right, already!

599
00:58:07,864 --> 00:58:13,825
Come in if you must. The door`s
open, you son of a bitch!

600
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:28,840
ln here, you lousy piece
of merde.

601
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:41,864
-Well?
-God, you`re beautiful.

602
00:58:41,898 --> 00:58:45,857
-Please, l look a mess.
-No, you look so beautiful.

603
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:48,871
Anyway, come already
to the point.

604
00:58:48,905 --> 00:58:54,866
l`m going to leave Lila.
l can`t stop thinking about you.

605
00:58:54,911 --> 00:58:58,870
-l`ve moved on.
-l love you, Gabrielle.

606
00:59:02,919 --> 00:59:06,878
Just give me some time
to let Lila down easy.

607
00:59:06,923 --> 00:59:08,891
She`s a really nice girl.

608
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:10,893
l don`t want to hurt her
anymore than necessary.

609
00:59:10,927 --> 00:59:16,888
You hurt me, you know...
when you made Nathan`s Choice.

610
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:20,892
Does that not even matter
to you, you pig?

611
00:59:42,959 --> 00:59:46,918
-You were gone a long time.
-Puff and l got into a...

612
00:59:46,963 --> 00:59:51,923
big, philosophical discussion.
He really is quite well-read...

613
00:59:51,968 --> 00:59:54,937
considering he`s only been
literate for a month now.

614
00:59:54,971 --> 00:59:56,939
He`s going to make us
really famous, Lila.

615
00:59:56,973 --> 00:59:59,942
-So he`s doing okay?
-Yes.

616
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:05,937
Very well. Just a quiet evening
enjoying his new digs.

617
01:00:05,982 --> 01:00:08,951
That`s funny, because l just
went and picked him up...

618
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:10,953
at a flophouse
on the lower eastside.

619
01:00:10,987 --> 01:00:13,956
He called here after he ran
out of his mad money...

620
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:16,959
where he`d spent
the entire evening drinking...

621
01:00:16,993 --> 01:00:18,961
watching strippers
and fucking a whore.

622
01:00:18,995 --> 01:00:21,964
So, what did you do
tonight, honey?

623
01:00:21,998 --> 01:00:25,957
-Shit.
-What did you do tonight, honey?

624
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:29,972
l`m in love with
somebody else, Lila.

625
01:00:30,006 --> 01:00:34,966
-And what did you do tonight?
-l fucked her, ok? l fucked her!

626
01:00:36,012 --> 01:00:37,980
Do you know what
l gave up to be with you?

627
01:00:38,014 --> 01:00:40,983
-Yes.
-l gave up my soul!

628
01:00:41,017 --> 01:00:45,977
l gave up my beliefs.
l gave up my body hair.

629
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,008
So, without further ado...

630
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:11,002
l give you Dr. Nathan Bronfman...
and Puff.

631
01:01:13,049 --> 01:01:17,008
Thank you.
Let`s get right to it.

632
01:01:21,057 --> 01:01:25,016
Here we have Puff
on the day of his capture.

633
01:01:40,076 --> 01:01:42,044
No maid service!

634
01:01:42,078 --> 01:01:45,047
Can`t you read the fucking
``do not disturb`` sign...

635
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:49,040
-hanging on my fucking doorknob?
-Lila, it`s Louise.

636
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:51,053
Go the fuck away, Louise!

637
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:55,046
To say that he took me
from crayons to perfume...

638
01:01:55,091 --> 01:01:58,060
would be a vast understatement.

639
01:01:58,094 --> 01:02:01,063
Dr. Bronfman took me from
playing with my own feces...

640
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:03,065
then to crayons...

641
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:07,058
then to an appreciation of the
complex works of Franz Kline...

642
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:12,063
Joseph Beuys, Marcel Duchamp.
From compulsive masturbation--

643
01:02:12,108 --> 01:02:18,069
This is who l am, Louise. This is
what l look like! This is me!

644
01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:20,082
And l don`t want to
pretend anymore.

645
01:02:20,116 --> 01:02:23,085
l offer you electrolysis
because...

646
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,087
jeez, that`s all l have to offer.

647
01:02:25,121 --> 01:02:30,081
But l want whatever makes
you happy, okay?

648
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:36,087
-Does this make you happy?
-Why won`t they let me be happy?

649
01:02:38,134 --> 01:02:43,094
l don`t know what to do.
l don`t know what to do.

650
01:02:45,141 --> 01:02:49,100
-And l killed Puff.
-No. Puffs not dead.

651
01:02:49,145 --> 01:02:53,104
Sort of, he is.
And sort of, l did it.

652
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:58,120
You`ll come home with me.
We`re going to fix you right up.

653
01:02:58,154 --> 01:03:00,122
We`ll work around
the clock until it`s done.

654
01:03:00,156 --> 01:03:06,117
And so, goodnight, adieu...
until we meet again.

655
01:03:07,163 --> 01:03:09,131
Au revoir.

656
01:03:17,173 --> 01:03:20,142
-You were wonderful.
-Was l? l wasn`t a tad stiff?.

657
01:03:20,176 --> 01:03:22,144
Oh, don`t be silly.

658
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:26,148
And you were wonderful, too.

659
01:03:27,183 --> 01:03:31,142
l especially liked the way
you said, ``Au revoir.``

660
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:35,146
Come on you two.
Let`s go celebrate.

661
01:03:50,206 --> 01:03:54,165
That`s it. My name`s Puff.

662
01:04:02,218 --> 01:04:05,187
And now, the tango.

663
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:25,207
l thought it went
swimmingly today.

664
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:29,200
-You two make an excellent team.
-Fantastic.

665
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:59,230
To be taken from the depths
of depravity and ignorance...

666
01:04:59,275 --> 01:05:05,236
and raised to the heights
of culture and refinement.

667
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:09,240
This is the priceless gift
bestowed on me by...

668
01:05:10,286 --> 01:05:13,255
Dr. Nathan Bronfman.

669
01:05:27,303 --> 01:05:28,270
Done.

670
01:05:46,322 --> 01:05:50,281
So, we have 1 7 new bookings,
my wonderful man.

671
01:05:50,326 --> 01:05:54,285
Terrific. We`re all going
to be rich and famous.

672
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:56,298
-Thanks to you, Nate.
-Thanks to you, buddy.

673
01:05:56,332 --> 01:06:00,291
And your diligence and your
intelligence and perseverance.

674
01:06:00,336 --> 01:06:03,305
And, of course, to you,
my sweet, for your...

675
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:06,308
for your moral support.

676
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:11,302
Excuse me.
Are you Dr. Bronfman?

677
01:06:11,347 --> 01:06:14,316
-Yes.
-ls that a little boy?

678
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:17,319
No, Puff. This is a dwarf.

679
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:19,321
l guess they prefer to
be called ``little people``.

680
01:06:19,355 --> 01:06:21,323
-lsn`t that correct, my good man?
-ln actuality...

681
01:06:21,357 --> 01:06:24,326
l prefer to be
called Dr. Edelstein.

682
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:29,320
Dr. Edelstein is a fully-grown
adult, Puff, believe it or not.

683
01:06:29,365 --> 01:06:32,334
-Who, due to a genetic anomaly--
-Achondroplasia.

684
01:06:32,368 --> 01:06:37,328
--who, due to achondroplasia, is
actually a miniature human being.

685
01:06:38,374 --> 01:06:40,342
lnteresting.

686
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:42,344
Dr. Edelstein, what is it
we can do for you?

687
01:06:42,378 --> 01:06:45,347
For starters, you can find
your way into...

688
01:06:45,381 --> 01:06:48,350
that ludicrous Lucite case.

689
01:06:48,384 --> 01:06:51,353
-Not you.
-Look, what is this about?

690
01:06:52,388 --> 01:06:58,349
We have no money on the premises.
Please, if you`re from some...

691
01:06:58,394 --> 01:07:02,353
little person, or rather,
achondroplasiac terrorist group...

692
01:07:02,398 --> 01:07:04,366
l want you to know l fully
support your cause--

693
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,359
l`m beginning to tire of you,
Dr. Bronfman.

694
01:07:10,406 --> 01:07:13,375
-Lila?
-Surprised, dearheart?

695
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:16,378
-This is Lila?
-Yes, this is Lila. Cunt!

696
01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:20,382
American and proud of it.

697
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:23,385
The hair`s gone, Nathan.
All taken care of.

698
01:07:23,419 --> 01:07:27,378
And l have muscles now. And l get
looks every day in the street.

699
01:07:27,423 --> 01:07:31,382
-You`re beautiful.
-Do you want to touch me, or what?

700
01:07:31,427 --> 01:07:32,394
-Yes.
-Poor baby.

701
01:07:32,428 --> 01:07:35,397
Thank you, Frank.
You`re the best.

702
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:37,399
Anything and everything
for you, my dear.

703
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:39,401
Frank and l both know
what it is to be shunned...

704
01:07:39,435 --> 01:07:41,403
because of our appearance.

705
01:07:41,437 --> 01:07:45,396
``The attempt to force human
beings to despise themselves...

706
01:07:45,441 --> 01:07:48,410
is what l call hell.
Andre Malraux.

707
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:58,420
Sorry, parking`s
a bitch at this place.

708
01:07:58,454 --> 01:08:00,422
There`s an overflow lot
across the street.

709
01:08:00,456 --> 01:08:01,423
Yeah, l found it.

710
01:08:01,457 --> 01:08:04,426
Just over on Tilton.
You can`t miss it.

711
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:07,429
Right next to the V.A. hospital.

712
01:08:07,463 --> 01:08:10,432
We`d be happy to validate
your stub.

713
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:16,438
Tie them up.

714
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:18,440
With pleasure.

715
01:08:18,474 --> 01:08:20,442
All right, Fifi, give me
your hands. Come on.

716
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:12,494
Stay.

717
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:58,540
Bad.

718
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:02,544
Get up.

719
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:08,550
Stop.

720
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:12,554
Take off your clothes.

721
01:10:41,617 --> 01:10:43,585
Come on.

722
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:47,589
Off.

723
01:10:57,633 --> 01:11:02,593
We`re going back to nature, you
and l. l`m going to retrain you.

724
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:07,598
-l`m going to make you free again.
-But l like being human now.

725
01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:13,615
-l want to be the way l was before?
-Good!

726
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,618
l`m going to show you how.

727
01:11:16,652 --> 01:11:19,621
And so began my
re-education, gentlemen.

728
01:11:20,656 --> 01:11:25,616
Lila taught me so much.
She was a stern but fair teacher.

729
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:27,629
And over time...

730
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:31,622
l began to remember thejoy of
living in a pure state of being.

731
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:35,626
But something else happened
as well.

732
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:38,640
Something perhaps
distinctly human.

733
01:11:49,685 --> 01:11:52,654
Boy, you look so good
from this angle.

734
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:54,656
Sorry.

735
01:12:37,733 --> 01:12:42,693
You`re Iooking IoveIy this
evening. HeIIo, my name is Puff.

736
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:45,707
I am a perfect gentIeman.

737
01:12:58,754 --> 01:13:02,713
Do you want to touch me,
Nathan, or what?

738
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:09,731
l think something is wrong
with Nathan.

739
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:12,734
l, too, think something is
wrong with you, Nathan.

740
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:16,727
You have changed. You are moody.
You lash out.

741
01:13:16,772 --> 01:13:18,740
l feel when you make love
to me...

742
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:20,742
you really make love
to someone else!

743
01:13:20,776 --> 01:13:25,736
He hardly looks at me during
our love-making sessions.

744
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:30,741
l would never stop looking
at you if you were my girl.

745
01:13:30,786 --> 01:13:32,754
Mother, will you please tell
Wayne to stop...

746
01:13:32,788 --> 01:13:36,747
-hitting on my girlfriend?
-He`s a 6-year-old boy, Nathan.

747
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:38,760
He`s hitting on her.
That`s not hitting on her?

748
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:40,762
Calm down,
no one`s hitting on anyone.

749
01:13:40,796 --> 01:13:42,764
Maybe you could learn something
from your brother...

750
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:47,758
about how to treat a woman. Do
you no longer love me, or what?

751
01:13:47,803 --> 01:13:49,771
Tell me now!

752
01:15:05,881 --> 01:15:09,840
Just as l suspected.
Get down from the tree.

753
01:15:09,885 --> 01:15:11,853
Oh, please.

754
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:15,857
ls that as articulate
as you can be...

755
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:18,860
after all the time
l spent teaching you?

756
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:21,863
We discussed Wittgenstein,
for God`s sake.

757
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:23,865
Not that you ever had
anything enlightening...

758
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:25,867
to say on the subject.

759
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:37,868
Don`t worry, Lila.
l`m only here for Puff.

760
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:40,882
l`m with Gabrielle now.

761
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:47,879
She`s a wonderful girl.
Not some sweaty, dirty...

762
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:50,892
lusty girl.

763
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:58,889
Can l touch you, Lila?
Just smell you...

764
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:03,894
how you smell now...
all dirty and powerful.

765
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:08,899
Please teach me to be an ape,
too. l`ll study really hard.

766
01:16:09,945 --> 01:16:12,914
See, l`ve been practicing.

767
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:19,911
l`m not really good at it yet...
but watch. l`m trying.

768
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:41,932
Put the gun down. Please, let`s
be reasonable human beings here.

769
01:16:41,977 --> 01:16:45,936
You and Lila stay and have your
natural life. l`ll go.

770
01:16:45,981 --> 01:16:49,940
You`ll never see me again.
l`m not an ape.

771
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:52,954
Can l talk?
l have to talk.

772
01:16:56,992 --> 01:17:00,951
Hello, Nathan.
Nice to see you.

773
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:03,965
Allow me to explain my position.

774
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:05,967
Before you found me...

775
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:08,970
l was a simple complete being
in harmony with my world.

776
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:13,964
After you, l became duplicitous,
anal, totally out of touch...

777
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:17,968
with my surroundings.
ln a word, Nathan...

778
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:19,981
l became you.

779
01:17:21,016 --> 01:17:25,976
Lila has reintroduced me
to myself.

780
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:31,982
Hello, Lila.
l love and honor you.

781
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:33,995
l think you should
put the gun down.

782
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:41,993
Please! Don`t interrupt me.
How very rude of you.

783
01:17:47,042 --> 01:17:50,011
Words, words, words.

784
01:17:51,046 --> 01:17:53,014
Words are evil!

785
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:58,008
Are they not evil,
these words we use?

786
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:01,022
Does anyone know the
definition of simultanagnosia?

787
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:03,024
l was intending to look it up
before Lila saved me.

788
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:07,017
lt`s the inability to perceive
elements as components of a whole.

789
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:10,031
Thank you! Thank you!
My pleasure. Don`t mention it.

790
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:14,024
Good to see you again.
Stop! Okay...

791
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:18,028
Now l`m confused.
Nothing`s right.

792
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:23,033
l need to make sense. l need...
l need to make...

793
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:37,048
-Puff, you`re agitated.
-l talk! l! l talk! Not you! l!

794
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:44,055
l talk! l sing. l dance.

795
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:48,069
l kill you.

796
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:09,090
And then...

797
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:17,087
-l shot Nathan.
-Then Lila shot Nathan.

798
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:23,093
Then Puff shot me.
Then l died. That`s all l know.

799
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:27,108
That`s the end of my story.

800
01:19:28,143 --> 01:19:32,102
Do l go to heaven now?
Or is it hell?

801
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:35,116
Or what?

802
01:19:36,151 --> 01:19:38,119
l just stay here?

803
01:19:40,155 --> 01:19:45,115
l just stay here
and tell it again?

804
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,135
Puff...

805
01:19:56,171 --> 01:20:00,130
What happened to you is
as much my fault as Nathan`s.

806
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:03,144
l`m going to turn myself in
for the murder.

807
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:06,147
-l won`t let you do that.
-Stay here in the woods.

808
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:09,150
This is a sacrifice
l need to make.

809
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:15,145
Then l`ll live for both of us.
l`ll be the most...

810
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,157
free...

811
01:20:17,192 --> 01:20:22,152
-truest animal in the whole forest.
-That`s what l`m counting on.

812
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:32,162
But, first, go back and testify
before Congress about...

813
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:37,167
the waywardness of humankind.

814
01:20:39,214 --> 01:20:40,181
Okay.

815
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:45,186
lf you think it`ll help.

816
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:49,190
And so, gentIemen,
that is my story.

817
01:20:49,224 --> 01:20:52,193
I agreed to testify before this
committee because I hope...

818
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:55,196
to convey to the American
pubIic that there is indeed...

819
01:20:55,230 --> 01:21:00,190
a paradise Iost. Human beings
have become so enamored...

820
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:03,204
of their inteIIectuaI prowess
that they`ve forgotten to...

821
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:07,197
Iook to the earth...
as a teacher.

822
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:10,211
This is hubris, my friends.

823
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:16,206
And my story of destruction and
betrayal is proof of that.

824
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:23,213
l will keep my promise to Lila.
l will shed this suit...

825
01:21:24,259 --> 01:21:27,228
and return to the wilderness.

826
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:32,222
l will live out my days naked...
and free.

827
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:34,235
Thank you, sir,
and God bless you.

828
01:21:34,269 --> 01:21:37,238
Your story has deeply
touched us all.

829
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:40,241
We will pass some legislation
addressing this problem.

830
01:21:40,275 --> 01:21:45,235
Thank you.
That is aII I ask.

831
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:49,250
Goodbye, LiIa.

832
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:53,243
I take you with me
in my untamed heart.

833
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:37,298
I have to say, the crowd
isjust eating it up.

834
01:22:37,332 --> 01:22:40,301
I think that maybe he has touched
us aII with his message...

835
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:42,303
of respect for
the naturaI worId.

836
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:45,306
And perhaps we have aII
grown a IittIe bit today.

837
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:49,299
He`sjust turned west
on Warren Aven-

838
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:21,342
Wait!

839
01:23:24,379 --> 01:23:27,348
l saw you on C-Span.

840
01:23:27,382 --> 01:23:32,342
l`ve been looking for you for
30 years. Then there you were.

841
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:37,347
Such a beautiful...
beautiful grown man.

842
01:23:39,394 --> 01:23:45,355
-Mother?
-Yes, Derek.

843
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:51,372
lt`s a pleasure to
meet you, Mother.

844
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:55,376
But l`m an ape
like Dad was, and...

845
01:23:56,411 --> 01:24:01,371
l have to go back into
the woods now. Forever.

846
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:03,384
Oh, l suppose so.

847
01:24:04,419 --> 01:24:07,388
l suppose that`s what l thought
you were going to say.

848
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:11,392
lt`s good to see you
again, though.

849
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:17,387
l`m in the book. lf you want to
drop me a line or something.

850
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:22,392
l`m an ape, Mom.
l`m an ape.

851
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:26,407
And apes don`t drop lines.

852
01:25:21,496 --> 01:25:24,465
-Hello, my little boy.
-Hey, Ma.

853
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:27,468
Did you bring any clothes?
l`m freezing my ass off.

854
01:25:27,502 --> 01:25:30,471
Oui. Nathan`s suit.

855
01:25:33,508 --> 01:25:34,475
Sweet.

856
01:25:38,513 --> 01:25:42,472
You know...
l`ve wanted you forever.

857
01:25:42,517 --> 01:25:46,476
-Say my name.
-Gabrielle.

858
01:25:47,522 --> 01:25:52,482
-You remind me so much of Nathan.
-Like father, like son.

859
01:25:52,527 --> 01:25:56,486
Plus, so much of my little
mongrel doggie.

860
01:26:01,536 --> 01:26:05,495
-Let`s go eat. l`m starving.
-French?

861
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:07,508
Oui.
