529
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,225
And the Widows take the lead.

530
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,664
Hey, Black Widows, my
spidey senses are tingling.

Yeah. Thank you.

541
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,881
Where did you learn to skate like that?

542
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,481
Well, I once tried out for the Olympics,

543
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,755
but that didn't exactly work out.

544
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,023
You gotta maintain the
triangle configuration.

545
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:08,999
I've been over it and
over it with you guys.

546
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,261
What do you want to do? Come on.

547
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:14,237
l don't need to do the triangle.
I need to get up there and...

00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,872
JOHNNY: It's the second quarter
and we have Manson Number 1

549
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,536

550
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,944
This is a rough contact sport.

551
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:25,242
These girls are lean,
mean skating machines.

552
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,716
And they gotta go fast if they
wanna get past the blockers

553
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,378
who are trying to knock them down.

554
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,753
And by "knock them down, " l
mean "beat them to a pulp. "

555
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,850
Eva's gonna grab another four points,

556
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:38,555

26 over the Hurl Scouts' 10.

559
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,732
and Whiskey sweeps Manson
Number 2 out of the way,

560
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,798
making room for Honey to widen the gap

561
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:56,472
to collect another three points
there as we go into halftime.

562
00:31:56,948 --> 00:32:00,076

Here she is, Number 22, the fastest
thing on eight wheels, Babe Ruthless.

it's the final jam of the night.

I like the taste of fresh meat.

590
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,466
And Razor, with nothing
to lose, throws the rookie

591
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:35,513
into the last jam on
her very first game.

592
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,672
And dang.

593
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:40,844
Babe Ruthless gets a double shove
to the rail served up by Whiskey.

594
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,319
But she's back up like a Weeble.

595
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:44,753
Okay, okay, that's good.

596
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,089
She darts down the inside
and heads towards the outside

597
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,028
and makes a run for it out of the pack.

598

away the judges in speed trials,

00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,790
Okay. Take a knee.

879
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,301
Okay. I wanna put what
just happened behind us.

880
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,703
l know I've moved on. We're
gonna run Play Number 2.

881
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,937
Fire and Smashley, you at least
know the first half of that, right?

882
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:42,804
Yes.

883
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,972
Okay.

884
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,677
Then get out there and get you some.

885
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:50,185
Hey, Scouts. You mind finishing
your little Family Feud huddle?

886
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:52,949
Survey says you're wasting our time.

887
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:58,389
Let's go ape shit.

888
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:03,121
Yeah.

889
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,202
JOHNNY:Coming out of halftime
and an alternate universe,

890
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:16,075
Coach Razor puts former figure skater
Bloody Holly in the jammer position,

891
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,205
who launches furiously into the pack.

892
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,250
The team is on their game now,
pushing Bloody to the front.

893
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,843
And she makes it through
Bitch and Cookie Flake

894
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:26,822
grabbing a total of eight
points for the Hurl Scouts.

895
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:28,188
Come on, come on.

896
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:32,855
The Hurl Scouts are catching up
in points for the first time ever.

897
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,898
As this space oddity continues,

898
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:39,026
Babe Ruthless uses
her speed to fly by...

899
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:42,095
Oh! Axels of Evil knocks her down.

900
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:45,198
But she's back up. Here
they come around the turn.

901
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:46,868
A choreographed move
from the Hurl Scouts.

902
00:50:46,944 --> 00:50:48,878
Has to be from Razor's playbook.

903
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:50,914
That makes the score 58-58,

904
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:53,006
a first in the history
of the Hurl Scouts.

905
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:56,678
l can't believe I'm saying this,
but the Hurl Scouts are tied.

906
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,245
We got a tie game here, folks.

907
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,381
Oh, yeah? Oh, but Smashley goes down.

908
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,289
Really? Bitch. What the...No.

909
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,555
Ooh, watch out, Tammy. No. No.

910
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,597
Here comes Smashley.

911
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:09,063
Get off me, you psycho.

912
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:10,930
We've got two girls
brawling on the track.

913
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:13,902
I don't know whether to break it
up or break out the video camera.

914
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:16,906
Hell hath no fury like a woman fouled.

915
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:18,100
That's not legal.

916
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,769
By day, these ladies are your
favorite waitresses, nurses, teachers,

917
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:26,145
but by night these girls give
the crowd what they came for.

918
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:30,116
Smashley Simpson is out of
here. We're only moments to go

919
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,586
and the Hurl Scouts have
managed to squeak out in front.

920
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:37,252
We're at a 70-67. Hurl Scouts.

921
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:41,821
Okay, grab her wrists,
hold on tight. Go.

922
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,294
Play Number 8. You ready for the whip?

923
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,097
Put your arm out, I'll be there.

924
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:48,604
JOHNNY: It's the final
seconds of the game.

925
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,936
Manson ramps Cookie Rumble,
and the Hurl Scouts attempt

926
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:53,238
a classic move in derby. Maggie.

927
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,244
Babe and Maggie go for the
whip, and it's effective.

928
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,507
Nothing gives you speed like the whip.

929
00:51:57,915 --> 00:51:59,177
(EXCLAIMING)

930
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,581
A whip. Ruthless is flying into the pack

931
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,779
while her teammates are doing
a downright professional job

932
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:07,984
of clearing the way. She picks
up one, two, three, four points.

933
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:11,619
Break out the merit badges. 7 4-67.

934
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:12,821
(BUZZER SOUNDS)

935
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,761
The Hurl Scouts have finally won one.

936
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:15,821
(HORN SOUNDING)

937
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,696
Fight Attendants, this
is your captain speaking.

938
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,463
It's gonna be a long, bumpy ride back
to Loserville. So if you have your...

939
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:23,631
ALL: ...you win the game. If you
run the plays, you win the game!

940
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:26,141
How about them Hurl Scouts?
Yeah. How about them Hurl Scouts?

941
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,507
How about them Hurl Scouts?

942
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,704
Touché, ladies. Touché.

943
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,044
We got to run the plays. We
run the plays, we win the game.

944
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,548
MAGGIE: We'll do our
homework. Every time.

945
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:37,879
There're only 10 of them.
It's not... Not rocket science.

946
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,512
Let's get those Holy Rollers.

947
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:40,851
BOTH: Yes.

948
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:43,822
(HIGH TIMES PLAYING)

949
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,064
OLIVER: (SINGING) I
put a bomb in your fire

950
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,460
You say
oh-oh-oh-oh

951
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,835
I put a bomb in your
fire You say oh-oh-oh-oh

952
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:59,740
Murray. Murray. Murray!

953
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,074
(SINGING) There is a way to predict
the outcome of people like you

954
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:07,706
You are a sheep in sheep's
clothing and you know, you know

955
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:11,345
I am a-coming to get
you You say oh-oh, oh-oh

956
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:14,255
There is a way to
predict the outcome of...

957
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:19,227
Please tell me you did not
shove Corbi Booth over a rail.

958
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,494
Actually, I did.

959
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:24,728
Corbi has a huge bruise on her leg.

960
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:27,668
I know that you're just
too bohemian to care,

961
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,365
but she has to cheer tonight.
