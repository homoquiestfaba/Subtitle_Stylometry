- [birds chirping]
- [serene music playing]

3
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,502
Tell me this never has to end.

4
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:41,078
All things wither, Bruce,
but if we're lucky... not for a long time.

5
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,687
Aren't you
forgetting something?

6
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,529
Again?

7
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,699
[eerie music playing]

8
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,672
I can't resist you.

9
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,953
No man can.

10
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:30,781
[Poison Ivy] You've been
a good boy.

11
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:34,385
The foundation
was such a burden to you,

12
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:39,223
to us... just like
the rest of the company.

13
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:48,598
You know what you have to do
so we can be together.

14
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:57,074
[wind blowing]

15
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:02,346
[grunts]

16
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:04,882
Mr. Wayne, I think you've
over fed your philodendron.

17
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:54,765
[gasps]

18
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,068
[grunts]

19
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,971
[Bruce] Stop!

20
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,308
- [Bruce grunts]
- [Catwoman groans]

21
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:09,280
[straining]

22
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,687
This isn't you, Bruce.
She's controlling you somehow.

23
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,826
- Oh, hell. Sorry!
- [Bruce groans]

24
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,765
[Bruce groaning in pain]

25
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:35,039
[gasps]

26
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:58,762
[groans]

27
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:07,071
[groans weakly]

28
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:23,754
[groans] Oh.

29
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:28,192
[Catwoman grunts]

30
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:33,564
[grunts] How did you know?

31
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,800
Well, you haven't exactly
been discreet.

32
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:40,804
Appearing with Ivy in public and
signing assets over to The Roman.

33
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:44,775
I'll wake the lawyers, sir.

34
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,312
Police will be here any minute.

35
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:50,314
Tell them everything you
remember and then get to bed.

36
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:52,182
You look awful.

37
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:55,953
I told you
I don't want a partner.

38
00:08:58,322 --> 00:09:00,357
You sure wanted one
these past three months.

39
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:04,328
Three months?

40
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:07,564
It took a while to catch the jolly
green Jezebel with her guard down.

41
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:11,268
- [Bruce] And Holiday?
- Still at large.

42
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,252
Gilda, I'm sorry.
We'll make the late movie.

43
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:30,154
I'm looking forward to it.

44
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:32,356
I think I'd like to go home.

45
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:33,557
Why? We can...

46
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,194
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

47
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:59,116
[Harvey] Jesus!

48
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:00,551
[camera shutter clicks]

49
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:01,518
[Gordon] Harvey...

50
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:04,888
you were right.

51
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,295
Chong's been supplying Holiday
with his guns.

52
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:20,003
You should have listened to me,
Jim, moved on this guy sooner.

53
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,005
We might have
learned something.

54
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,875
[sighs] The Holiday Killer's
covering his tracks.

55
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:27,578
[camera shutter clicking]

56
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:28,579
[Gordon] Mother's Day.

57
00:10:29,513 --> 00:10:30,881
This one snuck up on us.

58
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:32,916
Sure did.

59
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:35,619
Where's our friend?

60
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:39,289
[camera shutter clicking]

61
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:42,326
[siren wailing]

00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:44,428
[thunder rumbling]

00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:52,536
[neighing]

64
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:03,313
[grunts]

65
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:11,088
[Batman] Who helped you escape?

66
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:13,090
- Give me a name or I'll...
- [knife thrusts]

67
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:14,158
[Batman grunts]

[Batman gasping]

71
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:38,582
[gasping]

72
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,095
[Scarecrow] It was my mother.

73
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:56,433
That's who helped me.

74
00:11:56,467 --> 00:12:00,437
I strangled the old witch
years ago,

75
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:07,010
but I think she still watches
over handsome little Jonny.

76
00:12:14,218 --> 00:12:16,186
[whimpering]

77
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,622
Happy Mother's Day.

78
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:24,061
[screaming]

79
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:29,566
Mother.

80
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:31,769
[Scarecrow laughs menacingly]

81
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:42,212
Through here.

82
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:49,286
[man] Sweetheart,
I don't know if this is the...

83
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:54,792
Take what you want.
Don't hurt us.

84
00:12:55,626 --> 00:12:56,693
[Batman groaning]

85
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:27,491
[gun firing]

86
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,291
[breathing heavily]

87
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:02,693
[woman] Is he okay?

88
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:04,194
I don't care. Let's go.

89
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:10,434
[gasps]

90
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:17,240
Bruce, what are you doing?

91
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:24,448
[Bruce] Mother?

92
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:26,683
We have to get you home.

93
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:32,422
[thunder rumbling]

94
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:38,428
Bruce!

95
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,331
Where... where is she, Alfred?

96
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,770
- She?
- My... my mother.

97
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:48,806
I was with my mother.

98
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,882
[grunts] Up we go.

99
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:13,263
[reporter] <i>Gotham police
are searching for two inmates</i>

100
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:15,699
<i>that escaped
from Arkham Asylum last night.</i>

101
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:19,703
<i>One of them, Dr. Jonathan
Crane, aka the Scarecrow,</i>

102
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:22,572
<i>stole one of Arkham's horses
from the grounds.</i>

103
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:24,776
<i>He's considered
extremely dangerous.</i>

104
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:26,811
<i>Anyone with knowledge
of his whereabouts</i>

105
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,881
<i>needs to call the Gotham PD
hotline right away.</i>

106
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:32,215
<i>Again, he's considered
highly dangerous.</i>

107
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:35,252
Wait.

108
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:38,756
I packed your lunch.

109
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:47,631
Thanks. I gotta go.

110
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,936
[door closes]

111
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,357
I've come to see my father.

112
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:20,330
It's a tie.

113
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:26,503
[sighs wearily] And, yes,
my parole officer knows I'm here.

114
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,284
Sofia, my little girl.

115
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,355
Heat give you
any trouble downstairs?

116
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:48,692
There's more cops here than I ever
saw in ten years on the inside.

117
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:53,563
"Holiday detail." For my
protection, or so they tell me.

118
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,501
- Listen, I'm very busy, so...
- That's why I need to talk to you.

119
00:16:57,534 --> 00:17:00,737
Poppa, I want to be
in the room.

120
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:02,774
Sofia, we have
already discussed...

121
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:05,509
I executed the Crane escape
like you ordered.

122
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:07,511
And this foolish war
with Sal Maroni, I think...

123
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:08,712
<i>Basta!</i>

124
00:17:12,784 --> 00:17:14,317
[sighs]

125
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:17,755
Things... are strained.

126
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:25,029
Half our top earners have been taken
out by either Holiday or Maroni.

127
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:30,333
We had a chance with Wayne, but now
that he's out, we have to restructure.

128
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:34,404
That is exactly
why you need me.

129
00:17:35,907 --> 00:17:38,508
I do not.

130
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:44,347
Sofia, if I bring you in now, our new earners
will think I am lining up a successor.

131
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:47,584
And that will make me
look old... and weak.

132
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:50,720
You are neither.

133
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:53,423
Nevertheless.

134
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:02,532
Good. End of discussion.

135
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:07,370
Now go buy something.

136
00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:11,943
Big, flashy. A dress, a car. I don't care.
Just make sure everybody sees it.

137
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,550
Happy Father's Day, Poppa.

138
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,800
[Bruce] Awful business
at First Gotham.

139
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,567
How do you know
it was the Scarecrow?

140
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:39,837
Crane recently fled Arkham.

141
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,706
Gases all of his victims with a
fear-inducing neurotoxin, so...

142
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:44,574
Yeah, you can't
really miss him.

143
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:48,545
- Look, So, Mr. Wayne...
- It's Bruce.

144
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:51,883
Can I get you anything?
Alfred makes a terrific Mai Tai.

145
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,486
It's 8:30 in the mor...

146
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,790
No... no, thank you.

147
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:02,525
We have some questions
about New Year's Eve.

148
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,728
The night Alberto Falcone
was murdered.

149
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:06,730
Harvey here was updating
the files.

150
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:08,766
And it seems that you were the
only passenger on that yacht

151
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,600
who didn't give us a statement.

152
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:12,469
Afraid I'm not much help.

153
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:15,039
I left the party before all
the commotion in a dinghy.

154
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,641
You probably noticed
it was missing.

155
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:20,845
Of course, I'd have given you
a statement anyway,

156
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:23,114
except that it would have been
a matter of public record

157
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:26,817
and could place my name next to that
of the young lady I went to meet.

158
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:29,086
I don't think her husband
likes me very much.

159
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,587
That's very convenient.

160
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,023
Well, not for her husband.

161
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:33,124
[chuckles]

162
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,127
[clears throat]

163
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,995
Here's what
I'm trying to understand.

164
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:40,998
You recently signed over
significant areas of your business

165
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:44,701
- to Carmine Falcone.
- That's all been reversed.

166
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:47,939
And I was drugged and manipulated,
if that's what you mean.

167
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:49,706
Was your father drugged
and manipulated

168
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:51,842
when he went into business
with The Roman?

169
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:53,743
You know everything
that monster is today

170
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:56,680
was born of the legitimacy
handed him by the name Wayne...

171
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:58,816
Harvey.

172
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:02,019
[Bruce] It's all right. Yes,
my father built hospitals with Falcone...

173
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:05,790
but the only influence
he was under

174
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:09,894
was an overwhelming desire
to save innocent lives.

175
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:12,629
And how many other innocent lives
did he end up trading for it?

176
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:16,901
Two... that I know of.

177
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,591
- [door opens]
- [Vincent] Please help my son.

178
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:43,060
I have nowhere else to go.

179
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:46,764
- This way! Over here.
- [Alfred] Onto the desk.

180
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:52,837
[sighs] Looks like four...
No, five bullet wounds to the chest.

181
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,573
You shouldn't have come here.
Your son needs to be in a hospital.

182
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:59,243
Where Luigi Maroni could
find him and finish the job?

183
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:02,313
No, Dr. Wayne, please.

184
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,248
Carmine is my only son.

185
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:08,651
[sighs] I'll do what I can.

186
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:12,823
- Alfred, get my bag.
- [Alfred] Right away, sir.

187
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:30,007
He's stable, but I don't want
to move him yet.

188
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,077
<i>Grazie.</i> I can never repay you.

189
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:36,679
He isn't out of the woods.

190
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,049
Come on,
we have to let him rest.

191
00:21:58,169 --> 00:21:59,170
You shouldn't be here.

192
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:02,373
It's okay.

193
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:03,874
Do you know who my father is?

194
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:06,310
The Roman?

195
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:08,779
[coughs]

196
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:10,680
Smart kid.

197
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:12,183
So you know
who I'm going to be?

198
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:14,819
The Roman.

199
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,089
Very smart.

200
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:22,259
You remind me of my boy.

201
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:24,929
Your pop saved my life.

202
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:28,165
I guess that makes us family.

203
00:22:31,202 --> 00:22:33,003
It fell out of your pocket.

204
00:22:33,037 --> 00:22:35,039
My insurance policy.

205
00:22:35,072 --> 00:22:36,841
There's a lot of bad people
out there.

206
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:39,176
Criminals.

207
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,680
And everybody knows criminals
are superstitious.

208
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:49,186
Sometimes all it takes to get out of a
bad situation is a good flip of the coin.

209
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,821
It didn't work for you tonight?

210
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:54,992
[chuckles] Yeah.

211
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:57,995
Still, two heads
are better than one.

212
00:22:58,896 --> 00:22:59,830
No?

213
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:03,801
Keep it, kid.

214
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:07,338
All we get is all we take.

215
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:14,778
I was eight when Dr. Thomas Wayne
pulled Luigi Maroni's bullets

216
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:16,013
out of Falcone's chest.

217
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:23,454
My father was dead by a
mobster's hand within a year.

218
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:26,757
Any connection between my family
and The Roman died then, too.

219
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:31,762
Thank you for stopping by.
If there's nothing else...

220
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:37,734
[Alfred] Gentlemen,
these are the names and addresses

221
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:42,406
for those who can account for Master Wayne's
whereabouts on the night in question.

222
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:46,709
A lot of names on here.
Must have been quite a night.

223
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:50,915
Yes, well, a man was murdered.

224
00:23:50,948 --> 00:23:54,251
Let us hope your respective
offices can deliver for him

225
00:23:54,285 --> 00:23:57,254
the justice still denied
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

226
00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:01,325
What happened to them
was a tragedy.

227
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:06,063
And all the more reason why your boss
should stay away from men like Falcone.

228
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:08,399
Will there ever be a time
when the sins of fathers

229
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:10,733
don't fall to their sons
for redemption?

230
00:24:11,902 --> 00:24:12,937
Good day.

231
00:24:13,771 --> 00:24:15,072
[door closes]

232
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:22,913
They're going to be watching my every move
today to confirm that I'm not the killer.

233
00:24:22,947 --> 00:24:24,281
Then you'll be staying in?

234
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:28,718
No, just pay off
some more alibis.

235
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:31,989
I have to go to work.

236
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:47,905
Sit tight.

237
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:49,373
If he knew about us,
it would kill him.

238
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:52,343
I'll be right here, love.

239
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:07,992
[Maroni]
Your favorite cannolis.

240
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:12,096
Cannoli. Cannolo for one,
cannoli for a box.

241
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:14,164
Your Italian is <i>sterco.</i>

242
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:16,467
I know, Poppa. I'm sorry.

243
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,903
Yeah. You bring cannoli
on Father's Day, I forgive.

244
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:21,038
Sit.

245
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:24,041
So...

246
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,313
This war with Falcone.
It's killing us, Pop.

247
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:32,583
Carmine thinks we've got something
to do with this... this Holiday jerk.

248
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,818
<i>Sciocchezze.</i>

249
00:25:34,852 --> 00:25:39,156
Carmine's paranoia is not to do
with Holiday but with the new DA.

250
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:42,059
Unless these two are one
and the same.

251
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:47,831
Dent's a crusader but I can't
see him getting his hands dirty.

252
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,234
More likely the Bat.

253
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:55,105
You want advice?
Win or lose,

254
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:58,976
the only thing that ends war
is peace.

255
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:01,345
Make peace with Carmine?

256
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:03,247
[groans]

257
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:05,382
Poppa...

258
00:26:06,183 --> 00:26:07,318
I don't know.

259
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:08,285
- I don't...
- [arrow swishes]

260
00:26:10,354 --> 00:26:11,288
[groans]

261
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:12,890
Poppa!

262
00:26:16,427 --> 00:26:17,361
Poppa!

263
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:26,537
[screaming]

264
00:26:33,477 --> 00:26:34,578
[panting]

265
00:26:38,148 --> 00:26:39,283
[breathing heavily]

266
00:26:41,552 --> 00:26:42,486
Sal!

267
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:44,955
I heard a gunshot.

268
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:46,557
Are you okay?

269
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:48,859
What happened?

270
00:27:10,347 --> 00:27:11,482
[sobbing]

271
00:27:55,993 --> 00:27:58,162
Strange place to do business.

272
00:27:58,195 --> 00:28:01,365
Guessing it's the last spot the
pigs leave you alone these days.

273
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:42,673
[Maroni] Working late?

274
00:28:42,706 --> 00:28:44,475
How the hell
did you get through security?

275
00:28:50,514 --> 00:28:52,416
You were with him, right?

276
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:56,086
I needed to put an end to the
stupid war with the Falcones.

277
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:00,491
My father's last words to me were that
I should make peace with my enemy.

278
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,129
At first I thought
he meant Carmine,

279
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:09,299
but Luigi Maroni
would have never wanted that.

280
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:14,538
There's only one other thing
he could have meant, so...

281
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:26,049
I'm here to make peace with the law.
Cut a deal.

282
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28,285
You want Falcone
and I got plenty on him.

283
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,655
Enough to put him away
for good.

284
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:39,831
In exchange for...

285
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:42,699
Dropping all outstanding
warrants against me and my men.

286
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:43,634
[scoffs]

287
00:29:45,302 --> 00:29:46,403
You want Falcone?

288
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:50,407
That's the deal.
Take it or leave it.

289
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:56,046
Tell you what.
Heads, I'll take it.

290
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:28,579
I expected a low turnout
after the New Year's fiasco.

291
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:32,482
- But this is really pathetic.
- Fine by me.

292
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:35,319
The more people stay home,
the easier my job gets.

293
00:30:35,352 --> 00:30:37,154
Speaking of jobs
getting easier,

294
00:30:37,187 --> 00:30:38,823
is it true you got Maroni?

295
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:40,758
It's not a done deal.

296
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:42,894
My office is working out
the details now.

297
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:45,696
But if ol' Sal tells a judge
what he's told me...

298
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:47,664
Let's just say today's
a good day for The Roman

299
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:50,133
to celebrate
what's left of his freedom.

300
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:54,072
Speak of the devil.

301
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:07,551
I'm surprised to find you
outdoors on a holiday.

302
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:09,921
- Dent.
- Falcone.

303
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:13,390
Actually, I was speaking
to your wife... Mrs. Dent.

304
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:14,391
Don't touch her.

305
00:31:16,393 --> 00:31:20,330
I never took you
for a patriot, Carmine.

306
00:31:20,364 --> 00:31:22,800
Oh, I wouldn't miss fireworks
like this for all the world.

307
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:26,838
Good evening,
Mrs. Dent, Captain.

308
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:28,806
[Gordon] Evening.

309
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:42,486
I tell you, Harv, if I could, I'd have
every cop in the city here tonight.

310
00:31:52,897 --> 00:31:54,866
[indistinct radio chatter]

I've been thinking about it
and maybe you're right.

322
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,534
Uh, about what?

323
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,942
Having kids.

324
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:55,753
Stay down.

Get to Gordon. I'll be back.

Not till I know why this
scumbag is trying to kill me.

If I was trying to kill you,
you'd would be dead already.

Into doing what?

00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:45,522
that's the drop.

355
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,861
As for the Bat,

356
00:36:50,895 --> 00:36:53,764
delivering him
wasn't part of the deal.

357
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:58,702
[inhales] So we can do
whatever we want with him.

358
00:36:58,735 --> 00:37:02,106
[laughs] What fun.

359
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,849
Twinkle, twinkle little bat...

360
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:18,155
how I wonder what you're...
[grunts]

361
00:37:18,189 --> 00:37:22,193
Your business with The Roman
ends tonight.

362
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,230
[groans] No.

363
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,166
[shrieks, coughs]

364
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,501
- [Mad Hatter laughing]
- [screams]

365
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:38,575
Poor little thing.
Such a tiny little thing.

366
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:40,044
[continues laughing]

367
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:50,921
[groaning]

368
00:38:07,138 --> 00:38:09,240
[Harvey] No.

369
00:38:09,273 --> 00:38:10,707
- [footsteps approaching]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

370
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:16,646
- [man] Down here.
- [woman] What do you got?

371
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,882
[growling voice] <i>Run!</i>

372
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:26,689
<i>Motive means opportunity.</i>

373
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:28,625
<i>Dent. All right,
let me be clear,</i>

374
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:31,929
<i>this freak is done
terrorizing my family. Done!</i>

375
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:35,099
<i>You expect us to believe that
a respected public servant...</i>

376
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:38,735
- I don't know why you watch that garbage.
- Is it true?

377
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:40,137
You believe this BS?

378
00:38:40,171 --> 00:38:42,039
Is that why
you want a divorce?

379
00:38:42,073 --> 00:38:44,942
I never said that.
I have been talking about therapy.

380
00:38:44,975 --> 00:38:49,313
Maybe divorce isn't so bad,
now that you can't go back to him...

381
00:38:49,346 --> 00:38:51,215
[growling voice]
<i>Ungrateful bitch.</i>

382
00:38:55,652 --> 00:38:58,588
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

383
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:02,692
I'm going to be late for court.

384
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,100
You left the basement door
open again.

385
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:11,769
I haven't been
in the basement today.

386
00:39:11,802 --> 00:39:14,704
[door clicks open and closes]

387
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:36,693
[indistinct chatter]

388
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,080
Mr. Dent?

389
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:02,386
Mr. Dent,
are you ready to proceed?

390
00:40:02,419 --> 00:40:05,688
[clears throat] Uh, yes.
Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.

391
00:40:05,722 --> 00:40:07,224
[growling voice] <i>Murderer.</i>

392
00:40:07,258 --> 00:40:08,359
What?

393
00:40:12,062 --> 00:40:15,732
I asked if you're ready,
Mr. Dent.

394
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:18,369
Yes, of course. [clears throat]

395
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:23,740
Mr. Maroni, you have
confessed to 19 counts...

396
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:24,775
[growling voice] <i>Confess.</i>

397
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:31,882
What the hell is he...

398
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:35,386
He's here, Captain. The roof.

399
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:39,256
Mr. District Attorney,
we are all waiting.

400
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,059
Uh, yes, yes.
Sorry, Your Honor.

401
00:40:46,997 --> 00:40:49,066
[Gordon] Rooftop
really necessary?

402
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:51,101
I thought you'd want privacy.

403
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:53,204
Harvey's starting
to lose it down there.

404
00:40:53,237 --> 00:40:56,240
I think all this Holiday speculation
in the press is finally getting to...

405
00:40:57,274 --> 00:40:59,810
Privacy? Why?

406
00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:04,949
Where'd you find them?

407
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,284
You're not going to like it.

408
00:41:09,486 --> 00:41:11,055
Uh, yeah.

409
00:41:11,088 --> 00:41:13,057
I hit Frankie Gazzo
and his brother Lenny.

410
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,526
Tossed their bodies
in the Gotham River.

411
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:18,462
Lots of wise guys you're
looking for are in there.

412
00:41:18,495 --> 00:41:22,032
Maybe that's why I got an ulcer.
You know, from drinking the water?

413
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:23,234
[laughter]

414
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:29,173
And didn't you commit
these murders and felonies

415
00:41:29,206 --> 00:41:33,310
under direct orders from
Carmine "The Roman" Falcone?

416
00:41:36,146 --> 00:41:39,049
Felonies?
Nah, guy's a saint.

417
00:41:40,484 --> 00:41:41,885
[indistinct murmuring]

418
00:41:51,528 --> 00:41:53,030
[raucous laughter]

419
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,341
- [growling voice] <i>Now.</i>
- Now.

420
00:42:07,044 --> 00:42:08,178
[Maroni] You okay, Dent?

421
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,547
What is it, heartburn?

422
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:12,950
Happy to share.

423
00:42:14,018 --> 00:42:15,352
Now, Mr. Maroni,

424
00:42:15,386 --> 00:42:17,454
may I remind you
that your immunity

425
00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:20,858
is contingent upon your truthful
testimony during these proceedings.

426
00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:24,128
And I told you the truth.
Falcone is clean as a whistle.

427
00:42:25,195 --> 00:42:26,964
[growling voice laughs]

428
00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:31,035
Sal, what are you doing?

429
00:42:31,068 --> 00:42:32,169
What I'm told.

430
00:42:34,171 --> 00:42:36,440
Okay.

431
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:39,443
- Um, Your Honor, in light of the witness's...
- [growling voice] <i>Double cross!</i>

432
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:43,280
...change of heart,
I need to request a continuance.

433
00:42:43,314 --> 00:42:47,084
Continuance? Uh. what is that?
Like, uh, a holiday?

434
00:42:47,117 --> 00:42:48,619
- What?
- [growling voice] <i>Holiday.</i>

435
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:50,854
You know, like Father's Day.

436
00:42:53,424 --> 00:42:55,492
Luigi Maroni sends his regards.

437
00:42:55,526 --> 00:42:56,894
[growling voice] <i>Go.</i>

438
00:42:56,927 --> 00:43:00,164
[grunts and screams]

439
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:01,932
[people gasping]

440
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:03,133
[Maroni laughs]

441
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:04,535
Bailiff, detain the witness!

442
00:43:05,602 --> 00:43:07,338
You're dead, Holiday!

443
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:09,039
You hear me, Dent?

444
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:11,909
That stuff will
eat through concrete!

445
00:43:11,942 --> 00:43:13,410
[people screaming]

446
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,216
- [Batman] Harvey!
- [Gordon] My God. Call an ambulance!

447
00:43:19,249 --> 00:43:21,485
[Harvey panting]

448
00:43:33,597 --> 00:43:35,099
[imperceptible]

449
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,176
[growling voice] <i>Idiots.
They think it's you.</i>

450
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,879
[Harvey straining]
Who are you?

451
00:43:50,381 --> 00:43:52,316
[growling voice]
<i>You know who I am.</i>

452
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:56,086
No, I...

453
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,422
[growling voice]
<i>You sound tired.</i>

454
00:43:58,455 --> 00:44:00,290
<i>Why not let me take the wheel?</i>

455
00:44:01,392 --> 00:44:05,996
I don't know what's happening.

456
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:08,532
[growling voice] <i>I'm sorry
no one told you, Harv.</i>

457
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:10,200
Told me what?

458
00:44:11,168 --> 00:44:12,569
You're dead.

459
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:17,341
[phone ringing]

460
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:21,145
I have to take this.

461
00:44:24,515 --> 00:44:25,949
Yeah.

462
00:44:27,217 --> 00:44:29,052
[grumbles] Now?

463
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,289
No, it's the perfect time.

464
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:38,395
The doctor says he'll be fine
in a few days. Don't worry.

465
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:42,433
Oh, my God, he's gone.

466
00:44:42,466 --> 00:44:45,002
Secure the exits.
He couldn't have gotten far. Let's go!

467
00:45:08,192 --> 00:45:10,727
- [growling voice] Well, where is...
- [phone ringing]

468
00:45:13,163 --> 00:45:16,133
Let me guess.
You're not coming after all.

469
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:17,701
[Falcone] <i>Afraid not.</i>

470
00:45:17,734 --> 00:45:21,438
Yeah. You're not really
one to get your hands dirty.

471
00:45:21,472 --> 00:45:23,073
[Falcone]
<i>You know nothing about me.</i>

472
00:45:23,106 --> 00:45:28,111
I know you're a liar,
a thief, a murderer.

473
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,480
[Falcone] <i>A father.</i>

474
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,686
- A coward.
- [Falcone] <i>Goodbye, Dent.</i>

475
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,124
Fine.

476
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:44,161
He wants to talk to you.

477
00:45:50,133 --> 00:45:51,268
[thug grunts]

478
00:46:05,716 --> 00:46:09,386
[both gasping]

479
00:46:09,419 --> 00:46:11,088
- [straining]
- [bones crack]

480
00:46:21,465 --> 00:46:23,700
Come on, come on.

481
00:46:30,474 --> 00:46:32,376
Really? [sighs]

482
00:46:40,584 --> 00:46:43,253
- [music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

483
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:48,525
It's not personal.
It's business. [laughs]

484
00:46:53,597 --> 00:46:56,466
[singing "Happy Birthday"
in Italian]

485
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,101
[all singing along]

486
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:08,813
- [crowd cheering]
- [in English] Happy birthday, Poppa!

487
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,184
All right, here we go.

488
00:47:15,485 --> 00:47:18,322
[guests cheering]

489
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:22,159
What a wonderful night.
Thank you.

490
00:47:22,192 --> 00:47:24,796
This year has been
a trying one.

491
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:27,230
And while we have
yet to fully dismantle

492
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:30,835
the vicious machine
the law has set against us,

493
00:47:30,868 --> 00:47:33,637
you might say
we put a dent in it.

494
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:36,074
[laughter]

495
00:47:40,544 --> 00:47:45,282
To Sofia Falcone,
for brokering the peace with Maroni.

496
00:47:45,315 --> 00:47:46,350
<i>Mille grazie.</i>

497
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:47,751
[guests clapping]

498
00:47:49,419 --> 00:47:51,756
And my beautiful sister, Carla.

499
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:53,825
Where is she? Carla?

500
00:47:53,858 --> 00:47:55,292
[indistinct murmurs]

501
00:47:58,662 --> 00:48:00,397
Probably more TV interviews.

502
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,666
[guests laugh]

503
00:48:03,868 --> 00:48:06,938
Now, now.
Those interviews helped.

504
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:08,405
I think she's got a future.

505
00:48:08,438 --> 00:48:09,640
[guests laughing]

506
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:13,176
[elevator bell dings]

507
00:48:21,685 --> 00:48:23,888
[guests screaming]

508
00:48:35,232 --> 00:48:37,501
- [gasps]
- Sorry to startle you.

509
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:43,306
Shouldn't you be
looking for Harvey?

510
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,844
I'm narrowing down his location
by interviewing known associates.

511
00:48:49,646 --> 00:48:52,182
Known associ... Oh...

512
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:55,552
Well, you're wasting your time.

513
00:48:55,585 --> 00:49:00,257
The man's a mystery.
Or so it would seem.

514
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,894
Did you notice any recent
changes in his behavior?

515
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:05,462
Mood swings?

516
00:49:05,495 --> 00:49:07,364
Is that so strange
when you deal with people

517
00:49:07,397 --> 00:49:08,732
like Falcone every day?

518
00:49:11,635 --> 00:49:14,204
Harvey never mentioned
he went to Oxford.

519
00:49:18,442 --> 00:49:19,609
Is it important?

520
00:49:20,812 --> 00:49:21,745
Maybe.

521
00:49:24,015 --> 00:49:26,951
This doesn't feel
like just a job for you.

522
00:49:26,984 --> 00:49:29,286
It's personal. Why?

523
00:49:31,455 --> 00:49:33,958
He's my friend,
and he needs help.

524
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:50,808
[rats squealing]

525
00:49:50,842 --> 00:49:53,376
[growls]

526
00:49:56,646 --> 00:49:58,015
Dinner time already?

527
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:05,555
Solomon Grundy

528
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:09,326
Born on a Monday.

529
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,597
Christened on a Tuesday,
married on a Wednesday,

530
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:19,302
Ill on Thursday,
worse on Friday.

531
00:50:19,336 --> 00:50:21,471
- Died on Saturday.
- [chomping noises]

532
00:50:21,505 --> 00:50:22,739
Buried on Sunday.

533
00:50:24,809 --> 00:50:26,543
That was the end.

534
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:29,046
[Grundy gulps]

535
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,783
Born on a Monday.

536
00:50:39,056 --> 00:50:42,292
Reborn, resurrected.

537
00:50:43,593 --> 00:50:45,428
On a Monday.

538
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:49,033
Is that what happened to you?

539
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:50,868
Did you die and come back?

540
00:50:55,438 --> 00:50:58,441
Can a man live two lives?

541
00:50:58,475 --> 00:51:02,079
Born on a Monday.

542
00:51:06,784 --> 00:51:09,419
Born on a Monday.

543
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,063
[Calendar Man]
Thirty days hath September.

544
00:51:19,096 --> 00:51:23,100
But today's the one
that troubles you the most.

545
00:51:23,134 --> 00:51:25,036
[Batman] Where is he?

546
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:26,503
It's been months.

547
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,108
I've missed you.

548
00:51:31,142 --> 00:51:34,011
The DA who was attacked and maimed
before vanishing from the hospital.

549
00:51:34,045 --> 00:51:36,546
Hm, he does that.

550
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:40,885
Later that night, Carla Viti, who'd
publicly accused Dent of being Holiday,

551
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:43,386
was killed on her way to her
brother's birthday party.

552
00:51:44,454 --> 00:51:47,792
I know. Wasn't that terrible?

553
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:49,894
I think she was right.

554
00:51:49,927 --> 00:51:52,462
Of course you do.

555
00:51:52,495 --> 00:51:56,566
It seems everyone who comes
after Dent winds up dead.

556
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,736
We need to find Harvey
before he kills again.

557
00:52:00,637 --> 00:52:02,907
What do you know?

558
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:09,046
Gordon and his men have been here
day after day asking the same thing.

559
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,049
I'll tell you
what I told the captain.

560
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:16,087
Let me walk out of here
and I'll stop the killing.

561
00:52:18,022 --> 00:52:19,522
We're done.

562
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:26,197
It's Labor Day.

563
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:29,733
And, if the pattern holds,

564
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:34,604
I believe you have
something Holiday wants.

565
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,741
[sirens wailing]

566
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:39,643
[Gordon] Head North on Atwell.

567
00:52:39,676 --> 00:52:42,780
- Sir, the penitentiary is South...
- I know where it is.

568
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:45,682
This is the longest goddamn
prisoner transfer I've ever seen.

569
00:52:46,483 --> 00:52:47,852
[scoffs]

570
00:52:47,885 --> 00:52:49,787
Guess you guys
just can't get enough of me.

571
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,766
[officer gasps]

572
00:53:28,692 --> 00:53:30,027
[growls]

573
00:53:38,035 --> 00:53:41,504
Dent! You're alive?

574
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:44,574
He's no longer
running this operation.

575
00:53:44,607 --> 00:53:49,046
- [gun cocking]
- All right... that's enough.

576
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:53,050
Relax, Jim, I'm not
here to kill Maroni.

577
00:53:53,084 --> 00:53:57,721
I'm here to thank him
for giving me a new... outlook.

578
00:53:58,889 --> 00:54:02,625
Oh, my God. Harvey...

579
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:08,065
I have to tell you, Jimbo,
your gun has come in handy.

580
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:12,837
I know it was meant for Harvey,
but possession is nine-tenths.

581
00:54:15,739 --> 00:54:17,640
If you're not Harvey,
then, who are you?

582
00:54:18,209 --> 00:54:20,077
Holiday?

583
00:54:20,111 --> 00:54:21,946
We found the guns
in your basement.

584
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,950
You found the guns
in my basement?

585
00:54:28,252 --> 00:54:29,686
Of course.

586
00:54:30,653 --> 00:54:32,857
We know everything.

587
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,225
We just wanna
take you to get help.

588
00:54:34,258 --> 00:54:37,594
I think Thomas Wayne
was onto something.

589
00:54:37,627 --> 00:54:40,031
You can't beat 'em, Jimbo,
not your way.

590
00:54:40,965 --> 00:54:42,133
Join 'em first.

591
00:54:43,968 --> 00:54:45,970
Then beat 'em
on their own terms.

592
00:54:47,138 --> 00:54:49,572
Heads, you die.

593
00:54:54,178 --> 00:54:55,946
[Grundy groaning, coughing]

594
00:54:58,816 --> 00:55:01,185
[man in black outfit]
It is up to you, Harvey.

595
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:03,821
You and I know that both sides
of that coin are heads.

596
00:55:04,822 --> 00:55:06,223
How the hell could you...

597
00:55:08,192 --> 00:55:11,929
Oh, nice outfit, Bats.

598
00:55:11,962 --> 00:55:14,765
I suppose this little trap
was your idea.

599
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,034
Drop the gun, now! [cocks gun]

600
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:25,076
[gunshot]

601
00:55:36,387 --> 00:55:37,620
No!

602
00:55:38,989 --> 00:55:40,024
[grunts]

603
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:49,599
- [Grundy coughing]
- Come on, Grundy, move your ass.

604
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:05,916
[sighs] I think we're
back to square one.

605
00:56:28,172 --> 00:56:29,773
Ah, you're up early.

606
00:56:30,174 --> 00:56:31,741
Hm?

607
00:56:31,775 --> 00:56:34,011
Oh, no, I just got in.

608
00:56:35,446 --> 00:56:38,382
Of course. Then I suppose
it's off to bed with you.

609
00:56:41,751 --> 00:56:44,121
- Is there something I can help...
- How did it happen, Alfred?

610
00:56:48,225 --> 00:56:50,761
Were they forced into
business with the Falcones?

611
00:56:52,463 --> 00:56:54,731
Or were they so set
on building a legacy

612
00:56:54,765 --> 00:56:56,733
that they'd work
with the devil himself?

613
00:57:02,306 --> 00:57:06,043
Your parents believed that there are
two ways to look at everything...

614
00:57:08,979 --> 00:57:10,381
and everyone.

615
00:57:12,449 --> 00:57:14,051
Only two?

616
00:57:14,084 --> 00:57:16,787
They were young.
Two exceptionally good people

617
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,757
living in
an exceptionally bad place,

618
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:20,891
trying to make it better.

619
00:57:21,892 --> 00:57:23,761
But Falcone?

620
00:57:23,794 --> 00:57:25,362
Didn't they know that
by legitimizing him,

621
00:57:25,396 --> 00:57:27,364
they were helping
to make a monster?

622
00:57:27,398 --> 00:57:29,200
They made difficult choices

623
00:57:29,233 --> 00:57:30,901
and more than a few mistakes.

624
00:57:32,169 --> 00:57:34,104
But they were willing
to pay for them.

625
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,878
I've always told myself that I'm
doing what I do to honor them.

626
00:57:40,911 --> 00:57:45,282
What does it mean if deep down,
I'm really doing it to redeem them?

627
00:57:48,152 --> 00:57:50,321
I think it means
your parents would be proud...

628
00:57:52,423 --> 00:57:54,225
of their real legacy.

629
00:58:04,034 --> 00:58:05,002
[Gilda] This is absurd.

630
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:10,107
Sorry for the inconvenience,
ma'am, but it's Halloween.

631
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,144
- Mr. Dent is still at large.
- And Captain Gordon ordered us to be here.

632
00:58:14,178 --> 00:58:15,879
So, you're stuck with us.

633
00:58:16,847 --> 00:58:19,383
You've blocked in my car.

634
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:22,419
We're more than happy to drive
you anywhere you need to go.

635
00:58:22,453 --> 00:58:25,489
Though you'll be making our jobs a
lot easier if you remain indoors.

636
00:58:25,522 --> 00:58:28,225
There's no way to know where or
when your husband will show up.

637
00:58:29,193 --> 00:58:30,861
My husband is dead.

638
00:58:34,064 --> 00:58:36,500
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but that's not true.

639
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:39,436
Yes, it is.

640
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:47,511
[wind blowing]

641
00:58:58,589 --> 00:59:00,057
[guard] Wake up, Julian.

642
00:59:01,058 --> 00:59:02,993
You know what today is.

643
00:59:03,027 --> 00:59:05,329
[inhales and exhales deeply]

644
00:59:06,597 --> 00:59:09,933
It's All Hallows' Eve...

645
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:14,071
the 31st day
of the tenth month,

646
00:59:14,104 --> 00:59:19,910
and the 305th
of this miserable leap year.

647
00:59:21,545 --> 00:59:23,080
And...

648
00:59:23,981 --> 00:59:25,549
[sighs]

649
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,585
Taco Tuesday.

650
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:31,121
<i>Muy bueno.</i>

651
00:59:31,155 --> 00:59:33,357
- [distant thumping]
- What the hell?

652
00:59:56,613 --> 00:59:58,916
Trick or treat.

653
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,321
[Batman] Attacking us like that
out in the open...

654
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,558
It didn't fit the profile.

655
01:00:08,959 --> 01:00:10,627
So it was a hired gun.

656
01:00:10,661 --> 01:00:14,031
We see Dent and Holiday in the
same place at the same time,

657
01:00:14,064 --> 01:00:17,034
and, just like that, the DA
has got himself an alibi.

658
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:21,171
Did Harvey study at Oxford?

659
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:23,073
Like Falcone's boy?

660
01:00:23,107 --> 01:00:26,543
I see where you're going but
don't let Harvey hear you say it.

661
01:00:26,577 --> 01:00:29,513
He's a Gotham U man.
A dyed-in-the-wool nighthawk.

662
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:32,116
Don't get hung up on it.

663
01:00:34,385 --> 01:00:37,054
Not every lead checks out.

664
01:00:37,087 --> 01:00:40,457
And we already have
what we need to make our case.

665
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:42,659
It's hard to believe the man
who stood on this roof

666
01:00:42,693 --> 01:00:47,631
and made that promise, that bond with
each of us, would cross the line.

667
01:00:47,664 --> 01:00:52,369
Can you honestly say that man and the
one we met in the alley were the same?

668
01:00:52,403 --> 01:00:57,508
There are deep scars there...
and I'm not talking about his face.

669
01:00:57,541 --> 01:01:00,411
If you think we're wrong,
find the evidence.

670
01:01:00,444 --> 01:01:03,981
But, for now, the best way
to save lives,

671
01:01:04,014 --> 01:01:06,250
including Harvey's,
is to bring him in.

672
01:01:21,432 --> 01:01:23,267
[wind whooshes softly]

673
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:33,510
Do you know what my people
call this past year?

674
01:01:35,546 --> 01:01:37,214
The Long Halloween.

675
01:01:37,714 --> 01:01:39,116
My nephew,

676
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:42,686
my son, my sister,

677
01:01:43,654 --> 01:01:45,155
half my men...

678
01:01:47,724 --> 01:01:48,692
Why?

679
01:01:50,227 --> 01:01:52,296
Why would Dent kill your son?

680
01:01:56,433 --> 01:01:59,503
I wish I had the chance to be
a better father to my boy.

681
01:02:01,038 --> 01:02:02,473
We will never
see each other again.

682
01:02:04,776 --> 01:02:05,709
For that,

683
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:07,578
I am so...

684
01:02:10,314 --> 01:02:11,248
so sorry.

685
01:02:17,454 --> 01:02:20,491
There is a rule among my kind.

686
01:02:20,524 --> 01:02:22,326
We leave the wives out of it,

687
01:02:23,594 --> 01:02:26,764
but Dent does not play
by our rules.

688
01:02:29,299 --> 01:02:32,169
And when that happens,
he will die.

689
01:02:33,237 --> 01:02:34,271
Whose wives?

690
01:02:37,407 --> 01:02:39,376
I guess
justice really is blind.

691
01:02:39,409 --> 01:02:40,477
[gun cocking]

692
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:41,411
[suspenseful music playing]

693
01:02:42,346 --> 01:02:43,280
[grunts]

694
01:02:49,453 --> 01:02:50,420
[grunts in pain]

695
01:02:51,221 --> 01:02:52,222
Poppa.

696
01:02:52,256 --> 01:02:53,724
Everything is fine, Sofia.

697
01:02:53,758 --> 01:02:55,392
I just stumbled.

698
01:03:05,302 --> 01:03:07,271
That wasn't necessary.

699
01:03:07,304 --> 01:03:09,373
Maybe not.

700
01:03:09,406 --> 01:03:11,742
Are you going to tell me why
you're so obsessed with them?

701
01:03:26,156 --> 01:03:28,458
I never thanked you
for finding me

702
01:03:28,492 --> 01:03:30,327
and getting me home that night.

703
01:03:31,595 --> 01:03:33,397

if the good guys won.

889
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:51,448
Yes, the good guys won.

890
01:18:51,482 --> 01:18:53,317
But we won't know
for a very long time

891
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:54,351
if it was worth it.

892
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:29,686
Gilda.

893
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,167
[fire crackling]

894
01:19:48,472 --> 01:19:49,439
It had to be done.

895
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,142
You know that.

896
01:19:52,175 --> 01:19:55,612
The same way you knew Harvey
never went to Oxford.

897
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,648
That was me.

898
01:19:58,850 --> 01:19:59,784
Well,

899
01:20:00,551 --> 01:20:01,752
me and...

900
01:20:03,353 --> 01:20:05,088
Alberto Falcone.

901
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:09,059
If you could see
how in love we were then.

902
01:20:11,161 --> 01:20:12,663
I was pregnant.

903
01:20:12,696 --> 01:20:14,565
He didn't hesitate.

904
01:20:14,598 --> 01:20:16,133
We were married that same day.

905
01:20:18,235 --> 01:20:21,338
He was heir
to The Roman empire.

906
01:20:21,371 --> 01:20:24,107
And his father could never
welcome into the family

907
01:20:24,141 --> 01:20:26,310
a child
conceived out of wedlock.

908
01:20:28,145 --> 01:20:29,680
I tried to fight.

909
01:20:29,713 --> 01:20:31,381
But what chance
did I have opposite

910
01:20:31,415 --> 01:20:32,482
the godfather of Gotham?

911
01:20:36,788 --> 01:20:38,589
Against my will,

912
01:20:38,622 --> 01:20:40,758
our marriage was annulled
and our child

913
01:20:41,692 --> 01:20:43,293
ripped from my womb.

914
01:20:45,763 --> 01:20:46,764
What they did to me...

915
01:20:48,498 --> 01:20:49,733
the way it was done...

916
01:20:51,635 --> 01:20:52,770
left me broken.

917
01:20:54,605 --> 01:20:55,873
You wanted revenge.

918
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:00,878
I wanted justice.

919
01:21:00,912 --> 01:21:03,180
I came to Gotham and married
the man I thought

920
01:21:03,213 --> 01:21:06,383
had the best chance
of delivering it.

921
01:21:06,416 --> 01:21:10,454
Oh... Harvey and I
were so much alike,

922
01:21:10,487 --> 01:21:14,157
only what was inside him
hadn't yet been ripped out.

923
01:21:15,692 --> 01:21:18,395
That was... useful.

924
01:21:20,932 --> 01:21:22,199
And...

925
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:26,804
even fun for a time.

926
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:29,907
But then he became so busy
wrestling his own demon,

927
01:21:29,941 --> 01:21:34,211
I was left to take down mine
all by myself.

928
01:21:36,613 --> 01:21:41,886
One holiday, one twisted family
snapshot at a time.

929
01:21:45,823 --> 01:21:48,659
I have no regrets about
what I did to The Roman,

930
01:21:48,692 --> 01:21:50,795
or his son,

931
01:21:50,828 --> 01:21:53,463
or anyone else in that
godforsaken family.

932
01:21:56,266 --> 01:21:57,769
But Harvey,

933
01:21:57,802 --> 01:22:00,170
in the end, I loved him.

934
01:22:03,707 --> 01:22:05,208
But not all of him.

935
01:22:07,411 --> 01:22:08,813
So...

936
01:22:08,846 --> 01:22:11,581
are you going to
take me away or just...

937
01:22:11,615 --> 01:22:12,784
stand there in judgment?

938
01:22:15,252 --> 01:22:17,889
I need to know
that Holiday is done.

939
01:22:19,957 --> 01:22:21,324
Not done...

940
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:23,560
finished.

941
01:22:31,401 --> 01:22:34,571
I wonder... how long
did he know about me?

942
01:22:36,473 --> 01:22:37,708
Is that how you figured it out?

943
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:39,977
Did Harvey tip you off?

944
01:22:42,512 --> 01:22:43,580
He didn't give you up.

945
01:22:44,648 --> 01:22:45,649
Not knowingly.

946
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:49,386
But after Maroni was killed,

947
01:22:49,419 --> 01:22:53,490
the way he protected Holiday,
he must have known then.

948
01:22:54,424 --> 01:22:55,492
He was my friend.

949
01:22:56,526 --> 01:22:57,494
He believed in me.

950
01:22:58,428 --> 01:22:59,396
I should have saved him.

951
01:23:01,032 --> 01:23:02,399
What will you do now?

952
01:23:04,035 --> 01:23:05,335
Tell Gordon?

953
01:23:26,057 --> 01:23:27,424
[Bruce] Alfred.

954
01:23:27,457 --> 01:23:29,426
Really?

955
01:23:29,459 --> 01:23:31,963
I know it's late, sir,
but you never know.

956
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:34,999
It doesn't matter
how late it is.

957
01:23:35,032 --> 01:23:37,534
We don't get trick-or-treaters.

958
01:23:37,567 --> 01:23:40,437
Not all Gotham families
share your obstinate hope.

959
01:23:41,839 --> 01:23:43,740
It's going to take
a lot more good people

960
01:23:43,775 --> 01:23:47,410
trying to make things better
before we see real change.

961
01:23:48,345 --> 01:23:49,479
[doorbell rings]

962
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,349
If you say so, sir.

963
01:23:56,854 --> 01:23:57,955
You're cute when you're wrong.

964
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:01,625
[child] Trick or treat.

965
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:47,158
[doorbell rings]

966
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:49,093
[door opens]

967
01:26:54,664 --> 01:26:56,000
It's for you, sir.

968
