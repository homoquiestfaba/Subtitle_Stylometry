THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
THERE WAS SOME MISTAKE
IN THE MARRIAGE LICENSE,

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
WHICH CAN EASILY
BE CORRECTED.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
OR MAYBE
YOU'RE A KIDNAPPER,

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
AND YOU'VE STOLEN HER
FOR YOUR OWN.

80

ABOUT GOOD FORTUNE.

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000

THE CROOKED SIXPENCE.

I WANT THE ANSWERS.

WAS NOT TO BLAME.

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I THINK YOU WERE
VERY MUCH TO BLAME.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
IT WAS A STUPID MISTAKE.

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I GOT THE LICENSE
IN BUDMOUTH.

140
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
IT WASN'T VALID
IN ANGLEBURY,

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
AND, UM, WELL...
THAT'S THE WHOLE OF IT.

142
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000

146

THOUGHT ME UNWORTHY,

YOU SEEM
UNCOMMONLY PUT OUT.

148
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
DAMON, PLEASE DON'T
MAKE THINGS WORSE.

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
THERE'S NO NEED TO ADOPT
THAT TONE WITH ME.

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
NOW THAT ALL THE BONFIRES
HAVE DIED DOWN.

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
♪ AND BY THE STARS
SO HIGH... ♪

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
ALL BUT ONE, I SEE.

179
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
[WHISTLE
LIKE A BIRDCALL]

180
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
HERE.

181
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
THERE'S YOUR
CROOKED SIXPENCE.

182
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
NOW HURRY HOME NOW.

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
YOU DID WELL
WITH THE FIRE.

184
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'VE COME.

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
YOU GIVE ME
NO PEACE.

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
HOW CLEVER YOU ARE,
DAMON,

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
TO INVENT SOMETHING
ABOUT THE LICENSE

188
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
TO PUT OFF THE MARRIAGE.

189
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
YOU LOVE ME BEST.

190
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
WRONG. IF NOT FOR
THE WRONG TOWN,

191
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'D BE A MARRIED MAN
TONIGHT.

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
YOU'D HAVE ONLY
A 10-YEAR-OLD BOY
TO TEND YOUR FIRE.

193
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
IS THIS THE FACE
YOU'D CAST ASIDE

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
FOR THE SAKE
OF THOMASIN YEOBRIGHT?

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
IT WAS TO SAVE
MY SANITY.

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
YOU MIGHT GO TO SLEEP
WITH THOMASIN,

197
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
BUT WHICH FACE WILL YOU
SEE IN YOUR DREAMS?

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
THEN I'LL ASK AGAIN.

199
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
WILL YOU LEAVE
THIS DOG HOLE
OF AN ENGLAND

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
AND COME WITH ME?

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
YOU KNOW, I FIND
THE IDEA OF PARIS
VERY EXCITING.

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
YOU WILL, THEN?

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
BUT I HAVE
THIS GREAT FEAR NOW

204
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THAT THE EXCITEMENT
MIGHT NOT LAST.

205
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I ONCE GAVE YOU
SLEEPLESS NIGHTS.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
ADMIT IT.

207
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
ASK ME AGAIN...

209
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
WHEN THE HURT OF TODAY
HAS HEALED.

210
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
THERE ARE TIMES I WISH
YOU'D NEVER COME
TO EGDON HEATH.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
THERE'S NEVER A TIME
THAT I WISH I HAD.

212
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
'TIS MY CROSS,

213
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
MY MISERY,

214
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
AND IT SHALL
BE MY DEATH.

215
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
WHAT IS IT YOU
REALLY WANT,
EUSTACIA?

216
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
TO BE LOVED...

217
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
TO MADNESS.

218
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
RIDDLES.

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
YOU MAY TEMPT ME,

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
BUT I WON'T GIVE MYSELF
TO YOU ANYMORE.

221
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
YOU'VE SAID
AS MUCH BEFORE.

222
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I NEED TIME TO THINK.

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
HOW LONG?

224
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
MAYBE YOU ARE A WITCH.

225
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
YOU CAN KEEP ME IN PAIN
UNTIL MORNING.

226
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
KISS ME GOOD NIGHT.

227
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
HERE.

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
SUFFER ONLY
UNTIL YOU GET HOME.

229
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
SO, YOU REMEMBERED
WHERE HOME WAS.

230
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

231
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
TENDING THE FIRE
FOR MISS EUSTACIA.

232
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW.

233
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
SHE HAS YOU
UNDER A SPELL.

234
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
NOT SO.

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
SEE HERE.

236
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
A CROOKED SIXPENCE?

237
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
A CHARM TO WARD OFF
THE DEVIL

238
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
IS WHAT SHE GIVE YE.

239
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
EUSTACIA.

240
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
BEST COME IN.

241
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
ANYTHING YOU WISH
BEFORE YOU GO TO BED?

242
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
TO DIE IN MY SLEEP

243
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
AND NOT FACE ANOTHER DAY
ON THIS GRAVEYARD
OF A HEATH.

244
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I...

245
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I KNOW.

246
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'LL NOT ASK WHO YOU
WERE TALKING TO.

247
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
ONLY I HOPE IT HAS
NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE SADNESS

248
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
OF THOMASIN YEOBRIGHT
TONIGHT.

249
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
DO YOU THINK
I'M A WITCH,
GRANDFATHER?

250
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
IF YOU ARE,
THERE ISN'T
A PRETTIER ONE.

251
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
YOU MAKE SURE THAT'S
STACKED NEATLY NOW.

252
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
COME ON, CHARLEY.

253
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
ME OLD FRIEND
CLYM YEOBRIGHT'S

254
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
COMING HOME
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

255
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
FIVE YEARS.

256
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
HIS OLD FRIENDS WILL SEEM
AS COMMON AS MUCK NOW.

257
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I WOULDN'T WONDER.

258
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
MANAGER
TO A DIAMOND MERCHANT.

259
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
'TIS A BLAZING
GREAT BUSINESS

260
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
HE BELONGS TO
IN PARIS.

261
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
THE DEVIL WASN'T
BORN THERE,

262
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
BUT THAT'S WHERE
HE GREW UP.

263
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'LL BE PERFORMING
WITH THE MUMMERS

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
FOR MR. CLYM
AT THE YEOBRIGHTS'.

265
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
WE'VE NOT BEEN
INVITED.

266
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
THAT'S A SHAME.

267
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
HOW DO YOU FALL INTO
THE BUSINESS OF DIAMONDS?

268
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
YOU DON'T FALL IN.
YOU CLIMB UP.

269
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
CLYM YEOBRIGHT
WAS ALWAYS
A PERUSING MAN--

270
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
BOOKS UPON BOOKS.

271
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
HE'S WONDERFULLY
CLEVER.

272
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'D LIKE ALL
THAT'S UNDER HIS HAIR.

273
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
TOO MUCH SCHOOLING
THESE DAYS.

274
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
COME TO THINK OF IT,

275
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
CLYM YEOBRIGHT
AND EUSTACIA

276
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
WOULD MAKE A PRETTY
PIGEON PAIR.

277
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
COULDN'T BE
A BETTER COUPLE

278
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
IF THEY WERE
MADE ON PURPOSE.

279
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
THEY'D LOOK VERY NATTY,
ARM-IN-CROOK TOGETHER,

280
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
IF HE'S THE WELL-FAVORED
FELLOW HE USED TO BE.

281
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
FANCY PARIS CLOTHES.

282
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
THEY SAY
HE TALKS FRENCH

283
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
AS FAST AS A MAIDEN
COULD EAT BLACKBERRIES.

284
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
TOO BAD HE'S COMING HOME
WITH THIS BAD TROUBLE

285
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
ABOUT HIS COUSIN
THOMASIN.

286
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
AYE. POOR THOMASIN.

287
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
HER HEART HAS ACHED
ENOUGH ABOUT IT.

288
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
PROMISE YOU
WON'T TELL CLYM

289
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
WHEN HE COMES
HOME TOMORROW.

290
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
YOUR FACE
WILL TELL HIM.
I WON'T SAY A WORD.

291
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'LL BE CHEERFUL
FOR HIS SAKE.

292
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I WISH YOU'D
SET YOUR HEART

293
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
ON SOMEONE MORE WORTHY
THAN MR. WILDEVE.

294
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
YOU DON'T SEE HIM
AS I DO.

295
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I MAKE ALLOWANCES
FOR HIS WEAKNESSES

296
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
FOR THE SAKE
OF HIS VIRTUES.

297
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
VIRTUES? HA HA!

298
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
OH, SUCH VIRTUES.

299
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
HE LEAVES YOU
TO SIT HERE LIKE THIS

300
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
WEEK AFTER WEEK

301
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
WITH ONE LAME EXCUSE
AFTER ANOTHER--

302
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
THE MAGISTRATE IS GONE,
THE VICAR IS ABSENT.

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
PLEASE, AUNT.

304
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
YOU DON'T GO OUT.

305
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
YOU DON'T HEAR
THE TALK.

306
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
THEY'RE SAYING
THAT EUSTACIA VYE

307
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
IS THE CAUSE
OF IT ALL,

308
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
THAT HE STILL SEES HER,

309
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
THAT SHE'S PUT
A CURSE ON HIM.

310
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
DAMON MEANS TO MARRY ME.
I KNOW IT.

311
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
IT WAS HARD ENOUGH
THINKING OF YOU
AS HIS BRIDE...

312
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
WITHOUT HAVING YOU
BEHAVE LIKE HIS WIDOW.

313
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
ME OLD FRIEND
CLYM YEOBRIGHT

314
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
IS COMING HOME
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

315
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
YOU KNOW, SAM,
COME TO THINK OF IT,

316
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
CLYM YEOBRIGHT
AND EUSTACIA

317
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
WOULD MAKE
A PRETTY PIGEON PAIR.

318
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
AHEM.

319
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
GOOD DAY, MR. VENN.

320
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
MAY I PASS, PLEASE?

321
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
IT'S YOU I CAME
FOR A LOOK AT.

322
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
OH. AND WHAT MIGHT
A REDDLEMAN

323
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
THINK HE COULD
FIND IN ME?

324
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
IN SIMPLE TERMS,
MISS VYE,

325
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I CAME TO BEG THAT
YOU RELEASE YOUR HOLD
OVER DAMON WILDEVE

326
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
SO HE MAY
MARRY THOMASIN.

327
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
HOW DARE YOU SPEAK
TO ME LIKE THIS?

328
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
YOU HAVE SUCH POWER
OVER MEN.

329
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
IT'S A BEAUTY AND MANNER
YOU WERE BORN WITH.

330
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
YOU ONCE
LOVED THOMASIN
YOURSELF.

331
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
NOW YOU ACT AS IF

332
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
YOU WANT ANOTHER MAN
TO HAVE HER.

333
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
IF SHE CANNOT BE HAPPY
WITHOUT MR. WILDEVE,

334
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
THEN I DO MY DUTY
IN HELPING HER
TO GET HIM.

335
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
DO YOU AGREE
TO GIVE HIM UP?

336
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I AGREE TO NOTHING.

337
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
MAKE WAY, PLEASE.

338
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
MISS VYE...

339
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
YOU'VE HEARD
CLYM YEOBRIGHT'S

340
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
RETURNING HOME
FOR A VISIT?

341
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
IF HE LEARNS
OF THE SHAME

342
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
HIS COUSIN THOMASIN
IS GOING THROUGH,

343
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
HE'S ALSO
SURE TO LEARN

344
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
WHO'S AT LEAST
PARTLY THE CAUSE
OF IT.

345
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
REDDLEMAN.

346
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
NO DOUBT MRS. YEOBRIGHT
IS URGING DAMON WILDEVE

347
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
TO GO ON WITH
THIS MARRIAGE
WITH THOMASIN.

348
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
IF YOU SAY SO.

349
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
THEN MRS. YEOBRIGHT
SHOULD TELL HIM

350
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE

351
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
WHO ALSO WANTS
TO MARRY THOMASIN--

352
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
YOU.

353
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
MRS. YEOBRIGHT HAS
NEVER CONSIDERED ME
GOOD ENOUGH.

354
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
TO USE YOUR NAME.

355
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
THIS DEVILISH RED
THAT YOU FIND
SO OFFENDING...

356
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
WOULD GRADUALLY
DISAPPEAR, YOU KNOW,

357
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
IF I WENT BACK
TO FARMING.

358
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
PERHAPS IT'S NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

359
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'LL SPEAK TO HER.

360
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
AND I THANK YOU.

361
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I DON'T FIND YOU
OFFENSIVE,

362
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
JUST UNUSUAL.

363
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
AN ANSWER YET.
I NEED TIME.

364
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'VE GIVEN YOU
THREE WEEKS.

365
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
MRS. YEOBRIGHT TOLD ME

366
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
SOMEBODY ELSE HAS ASKED
TO MARRY THOMASIN.

367
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
AND AM I SUPPOSED
TO ACCEPT

368
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
THOMASIN YEOBRIGHT'S
CASTOFFS?

369
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
YOU KNOW THAT
THAT'S NOT SO.

370
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
COME WITH ME
TO BRISTOL.

371
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
WE'LL MARRY AND TURN
OUR BACKS ON ENGLAND.

372
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
THE YEOBRIGHTS
CAN BE DAMNED.

373
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
A WEEK.
GIVE ME A WEEK.

374
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
CLYM YEOBRIGHT
IS DUE HOME TOMORROW.

375
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
THOMASIN AND HER AUNT
WILL BE OCCUPIED
WITH HIM.

376
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
THIS WILL BE
OUR CHANCE.

377
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I HEAR CLYM YEOBRIGHT'S
A YOUNG MAN WHOSE STAR
IS ON THE RISE,

378
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
WELL-FAVORED, WELL-READ,

379
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
MANAGER OF
A DIAMOND BUSINESS
IN PARIS.

380
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
A GRAND LIFE IN THE MOST
GLORIOUS CITY ON EARTH.

381
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
AND WHAT HAS THAT
TO DO WITH US?

382
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'VE HEARD IT SAID
CLYM YEOBRIGHT AND I

383
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
"WOULD MAKE
A PRETTY PIGEON PAIR"--

384
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
IDLE TALK
FROM IGNORANT PEOPLE,
EUSTACIA.

385
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I CAN'T LIVE
IN TORMENT LIKE THIS.

386
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
EITHER TELL ME YES...

387
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
OR SET ME FREE.

388
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
OH, NO.

389
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
YOU MUST NOT KISS ME
UNTIL I'VE MADE UP
MY MIND.

390
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
OH, CLYM,
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE REALLY HOME.

391
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
WELL, HERE I AM, AT LAST.

392
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
JUST IN TIME
FOR CHRISTMAS.

393
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
WE PICKED THE HOLLY,

394
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
AND THOMASIN
HAS BROUGHT DOWN

395
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THE CHOICEST APPLES
FROM STORAGE,
JUST FOR YOU.

396
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
THE RIBSTONES--
YOUR FAVORITES.

397
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
WE MUST SOUND
VERY RUSTIC

398
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
TO THIS GENTLEMAN
FROM PARIS.

399
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
AH, A FINE WINTER'S DAY--

400
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
CRISP APPLES WAITING,

401
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
HOLLY BOUGHS
HEAVY WITH BERRIES...

402
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
SO, THAT'S WHERE
YOU GOT THOSE SCRATCHES.

403
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
THOMASIN, YOU'VE BLOSSOMED
BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS.

404
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
HOW DOES MY MOTHER
KEEP SUITORS

405
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
FROM OVERRUNNING
BLOOMS

406
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
HMM.

407
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
IT'S NOT BEEN EASY.

408
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
STOP.

409
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
WHAT IS IT?

410
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'VE PICTURED THIS
FOR SO LONG.

411
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
MOTHER, I WANT TO WALK
THE LAST MILE HOME.

412
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW I'VE DREAMED

413
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
OF COMING UPON THE HOUSE

414
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
FROM THE PATH
ACROSS MY BELOVED HEATH.

415
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU LATER,
MOTHER,

416
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I TAKE MY LEAVE OF YOU.

417
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
CHRISTIAN.

418
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
WALK ON.

419
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
GOOD EVENING.

420
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
YES.

421
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
WHAT'S WRONG, CLYM?

422
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
YOU'VE HAD
HARDLY A WORD FOR US
SINCE YOU WALKED HOME.

423
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
THOMASIN THINKS YOU'RE
DISAPPOINTED IN US
AFTER ALL.

424
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
ON MY WAY
OVER THE HEATH,

425
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
JUST BY MISTOVER,

426
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I SAW...A VISION,

427
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
A MAIDEN SO RARE IN LOOKS,

428
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'VE BEEN STANDING HERE
IN SILENCE

429
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
TRYING TO RECALL HER FACE

430
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
AND FEARING I'D LOSE IT.

431
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
SHE HAD BLACK HAIR

432
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
AND...PAGAN EYES--

433
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
THE RAW MATERIAL
OF DIVINITY.

434
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
SHE SPOKE ONLY ONE WORD,

435
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
BUT IT WAS LIKE THE SOUND
OF SOFT MUSIC.

436
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
MOTHER--

437
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
CURSE THIS DAY.

438
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
DO IT PROPER THIS TIME.
PUT YOUR VISORS ON.

439
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
GET YOUR SWORD.
GET YOUR SHIELD.

440
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
PUT YOUR MASK
AND HELMET ON.

441
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
REHEARSE IT RIGHT.

442
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
GET YOUR SWORD UP
AND GO.

443
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
HERE COME I, ST. GEORGE,
THE VALIANT MAN,

444
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
WITH GLITTERING SWORD
AND SHIELD IN HAND.

445
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
WHAT MORTAL MAN
WOULD DARE TO STAND

446
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
BEFORE ME
WITH MY SWORD IN HAND?

447
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
OH, I BE FRIGHTENED.

448
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
CHARLEY!

449
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
HERE COME I,
THE TURKISH KNIGHT,

450
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
COME FROM
THE TURKISH LAND
TO FIGHT.

451
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'LL FIGHT THIS MAN
WITH COURAGE BOLD.

452
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
IF HIS BLOOD'S HOT,
I'LL MAKE IT COLD.

453
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
MY BLOOD IS HOT
AS ANY FIRE,

454
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
SO I MUST SAY THEE NAY.

455
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
FOR WITH MY TRUSTY
SWORD AND SHIELD,

456
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'LL TAKE THY LIFE AWAY.

457
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE PASSED
AS MUMMERS IN OUR TIME.

458
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
STILL, IT'LL
HAVE TO DO.

459
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
YOUR FIRST OUTING'S
MONDAY NIGHT--

460
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
MRS. YEOBRIGHT'S.

461
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
SHE'S HAVING
A BIT OF A PARTY

462
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
FOR HER SON CLYM'S
HOMECOMING.

463
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
SEE THAT YOUR COSTUMES
ARE READY.

464
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
RIGHT. OFF HOME,
ALL OF YOU.

465
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
GOOD NIGHT THEN.

466
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
GOOD NIGHT.

467
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
CHARLEY?

468
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
YOU'RE
THE TURKISH KNIGHT,
AREN'T YOU, CHARLEY?

469
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
HERE COME I,
YE TURKISH KNIGHT.

470
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
COME FROM
THE TURKISH LAND
TO FIGHT.

471
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'LL FIGHT THIS MAN
WITH COURAGE BOLD.

472
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
IF HIS BLOOD'S HOT,
I'LL MAKE IT COLD.

473
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
WHAT A MIND YOU HAVE
FOR MEMORY.

474
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
IN YOUR HEART,

475
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
YOU'D DO ALMOST
ANYTHING FOR ME,

476
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
WOULDN'T YOU,
CHARLEY?

477
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'LL DO A GOOD DEAL,
MISS.

478
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
LET ME PLAY YOUR PART
FOR ONE NIGHT.

479
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'LL PAY YOU...

480
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
1/2 CROWN.

481
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
5 SHILLINGS?

482
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
NO...

483
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
NOT MONEY.

484
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
WHAT THEN?

485
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
WHAT YOU FORBADE ME
AT THE MAYPOLING, MISS,

486
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
WHEN YOU WOULDN'T
JOIN HANDS WITH ME
IN THE RING.

487
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
IF YOU'LL LET ME
HOLD YOUR HAND...

488
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
15 MINUTES...

489
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
FIVE.

490
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
YEAH.

491
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
NO...

492
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
NOT WITH THE GLOVE.

493
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
MAKE ROOM, MAKE ROOM,
MY GALLANTS, ROOM!

494
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
GIVE US SPACE TO RHYME.

495
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
WE COME TO SHOW
ST. GEORGE'S PLAY

496
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
UPON THIS CHRISTMASTIME.

497
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
AND IF YOU DON'T
BELIEVE MY WORD,

498
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'LL STRAIGHTWAY
CALL OUT, WALK IN,

499
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
O GREAT ST. GEORGE,

500
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
WALK IN, WALK IN,

501
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
AND BOLDLY NOW BEGIN.

502
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
HERE COME I,
ST. GEORGE,

503
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
THE VALIANT MAN,

504
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
WITH GLITTERING SWORD
AND SPEAR IN HAND.

505
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
WHAT MORTAL MAN
WOULD DARE TO STAND

506
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
BEFORE ME
WITH MY SWORD IN HAND?

507
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
HERE COME I,
THE TURKISH KNIGHT,

508
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
COME FROM
THE TURKISH LAND
TO FIGHT.

509
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'LL FIGHT THIS MAN
WITH COURAGE BOLD.

510
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
IF HIS BLOOD'S HOT,
I'LL MAKE IT COLD.

511
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
MY BLOOD IS HOT
AS ANY FIRE.

512
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
SO I MUST SAY THEE NAY.

513
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
FOR WITH MY TRUSTY
SWORD AND SHIELD,

514
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'LL TAKE THY LIFE AWAY.

515
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
THERE. YOU'RE A BIT
TOO REAL, LAD.

516
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
CALL IN THE SECOND,
THAT CHAMPION WHOM I DREAD.

517
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
WHERE IS THE SARACEN?

518
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
HE DOES LONG DELAY.

519
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
THAT HERO OF RENOWN.

520
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
WAIT!

521
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
WAS I SEEING THINGS?

522
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
OH!

523
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
IT IS YOU.

524
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
YOU'RE NOT A BOY.

525
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
THANK YOU...

526
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
SIRE.

527
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I'M...

528
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
AMAZED.

529
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
THEN I'VE PLAYED
MY PART WELL.

530
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
CLYM!

531
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
HERE YOU ARE.

532
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
DID YOU SEE HER?

533
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
WHO WAS THAT
LOVELY CREATURE?

534
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
EUSTACIA VYE,

535
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
THE CAPTAIN'S
GRANDDAUGHTER

536
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
FROM MISTOVER KNAP.

537
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
WHY WASN'T SHE INVITED?

538
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
OH, COME NOW.
WHAT'S THE MYSTERY?

539
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
NOW, DON'T FORCE ME
TO SPEAK ILL OF HER.

540
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
IT WILL ONLY
WHET YOUR INTEREST.

541
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I KNOW ALL ABOUT MEN
AND FORBIDDEN FRUIT.

542
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
NOW, COME INSIDE,
CLYM.

543
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
YOUR VISIT
WILL BE SO SHORT.

544
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
COME AND LET
YOUR OLD FRIENDS
ENJOY YOUR COMPANY.

545
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
YOU'RE NOT AN EASY MAN
TO FIND, REDDLEMAN.

546
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
AN ODD HOUR
TO COME LOOKING.

547
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID,

548
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
ABOUT THE NEED
TO MAKE MR. WILDEVE
COME TO HIS SENSES.

549
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
DID YOUNG MR. YEOBRIGHT
ENJOY YOUR PERFORMANCE
TONIGHT?

550
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
AND SINCE YOU SEEM
SO PERSONALLY INTERESTED

551
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
IN THE OUTCOME
OF THIS MATTER,

552
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I SUGGEST YOU DELIVER
THE NEWS TO DAMON WILDEVE.

553
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
ME?

554
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I SHALL WRITE
A FINAL LETTER TO HIM.

555
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
YOU MUST DELIVER IT
ON SATURDAY,

556
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
WHEN I PROMISED TO MEET HIM
AT SHADWATER FALLS.

557
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'M FOOLISH...

558
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
BUT I'M NOT A FOOL.

559
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
IF THIS IS
SOME BREATHLESS WHIM

560
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
BROUGHT ON BY A BRUSH
WITH THE DASHING
MR. YEOBRIGHT,

561
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'LL NOT ACT THE IDIOT
FOR YOU.

562
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
YOU'RE APT
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND

563
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
WHEN HE RETURNS
TO PARIS.

564
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'M BOTH A FOOL
AND FOOLISH.

565
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'M TOO FOOLISH
TO UNDERSTAND YOUR WISH

566
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
TO SEE THOMASIN HAPPY
IN THE ARMS OF ANOTHER...

567
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
BUT I WAS FOOL ENOUGH
TO THINK YOU MEANT IT.

568
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
WRITE THE LETTER.

569
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I'LL GIVE IT TO HIM.

570
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
DEAR MR. WILDEVE,

571
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
THE MORE
I CONSIDER THE MATTER,

572
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
THE MORE I AM CONVINCED

573
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
THERE MUST BE AN END
TO OUR ACQUAINTANCE.

574
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I HAVE DECIDED
ONCE AND FOR ALL

575
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
THAT WE MUST HOLD
NO FURTHER COMMUNICATION.

576
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
EUSTACIA VYE.

577
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
WILL THOU, DAMON,

578
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
HAVE THIS WOMAN
TO THY WEDDED WIFE,

579
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
TO LIVE TOGETHER
AFTER GOD'S ORDINANCE

580
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
IN THE HOLY STATE
OF MATRIMONY,

581
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
TO LOVE, COMFORT,
HONOR, AND KEEP HER

582
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
IN SICKNESS
AND IN HEALTH,

583
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
AND FORSAKING ALL OTHER,

584
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
KEEP THEE ONLY UNTO HER

585
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
SO LONG AS YOU BOTH
SHALL LIVE?

586
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I WILL.

587
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
WILL THOU, THOMASIN,

588
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
HAVE THIS MAN
TO THY WEDDED HUSBAND,

589
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
TO LIVE TOGETHER
AFTER GOD'S ORDINANCE

590
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
IN THE HOLY STATE
OF MATRIMONY,

591
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
OBEY AND SERVE HIM,

592
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
LOVE, HONOR, AND KEEP HIM
IN SICKNESS AND HEALTH,

593
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
AND FORSAKING ALL OTHER,

594
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
KEEP THEE ONLY UNTO HIM
SO LONG AS YOU BOTH SHALL LIVE?

595
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I WILL.

596
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
WITH THIS RING,
I THEE WED.

597
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
WITH THIS RING,
I THEE WED.

598
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
WITH ALL MY WORLDLY GOODS
I THEE ENDOW.

599
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
WITH ALL MY WORLDLY GOODS
I THEE ENDOW.

600
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
THOSE WHOM GOD
HAVE JOINED TOGETHER,

601
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
LET NO MAN PUT ASUNDER.

602
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
AAH! AAH!

603
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
EUSTACIA!

604
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
RUN!

605
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
JOHNNY!

606
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
GET HER
INTO THE CARRIAGE QUICK.

607
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

608
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

609
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
EUSTACIA?

610
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
WALK ON.

611
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
SUSAN NUNSUCH
STABBED EUSTACIA VYE.

612
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
IF BLOOD
BE DRAWN IN CHURCH,

613
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
IT STOPS
THE BEWITCHING.

614
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
SUSAN WAS FRIGHTENED
FOR HER JOHNNY.

615
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
WHAT NONSENSE.

616
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
BLOODLETTING IN CHURCH.

617
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
STUPID SUPERSTITIONS.

618
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
KEEP AT IT, CHARLEY.

619
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
YES, CAPTAIN VYE.

620
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
MISS VYE.

621
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I CAME TO SOLVE
THE MYSTERY

622
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
OF JUST WHO IS
EUSTACIA VYE.

623
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
YOU SEE HER BEFORE YOU.

624
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
YES, BUT IS SHE
THAT MISTY APPARITION

625
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
WHO APPEARED IN A FOG
ON THE HEATH,

626
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
OR IS SHE THE TURKISH KNIGHT
WHO WAS SLAIN AT MY FEET?

627
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
OR IS SHE THE WITCH,

628
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
WHO FOR HER CRIMES
WAS STABBED THIS MORNING

629
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
IN EAST EGDON CHURCH?

630
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
ALL THREE, I FEAR.

631
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
YOU HAVE
MY CONFESSION.

632
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I BLUSH FOR MY
NATIVE EGDON, MISS VYE,

633
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
THAT SUCH IGNORANCE
STILL EXISTS HERE.

634
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
IS THE INJURY SERIOUS?

635
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
IT WAS SHAMEFUL
OF SUSAN NUNSUCH.

636
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I WASN'T AWARE
I HAD SUCH
A MAGIC REPUTATION.

637
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE
THINKING YOU GUILTY
OF SUCH THINGS,

638
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
BEWITCHING AS YOU MAY BE.

639
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'VE BEEN BLAMED
FOR MANY THINGS,

640
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
EVEN THE DELAYED WEDDING
OF THOMASIN.

641
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
IS THERE TRUTH
IN WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT MR. WILDEVE?

642
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I ONCE FOUND HIM
AMUSING COMPANY,

643
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
BUT I'VE SENT HIM
A LETTER

644
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
REFUSING
TO SEE HIM AGAIN,

645
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
HOPING THAT HE WOULD
MARRY THOMASIN.

646
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I SUCCEEDED.

647
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
AN HONORABLE THING
TO DO.

648
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
THERE ARE THOSE
WHO'D SAY

649
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I CONFESSED
TO APPEAR INNOCENT
IN YOUR EYES.

650
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
THE ONLY THING
YOU'RE GUILTY OF

651
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
IS NOT APPEARING
HERE LIKE THIS
FIVE YEARS AGO

652
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
AND SAVING ME
A JOURNEY TO PARIS.

653
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
IT'S A DREAM LIFE
YOU'VE LEAD, I'M SURE.

654
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THAT'S FOR ANOTHER DAY.

655
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'LL CALL AGAIN SOON

656
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
AND OFTEN,
IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME.

657
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'D BE DISAPPOINTED
IF YOU DIDN'T.

658
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
WALK ON.

659
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
BYE, AUNT.

660
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
BYE, CLYM.

661
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
GOODBYE.

662
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
GOOD LUCK.

663
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
MOTHER, I FEEL
IT WAS TRUE FATE

664
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
THAT BROUGHT ME
BACK HERE
TO THE HEATH.

665
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
YOUR NIECE IS WED.
YOUR SON'S HOME.

666
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
YOU CAN REJOICE
TWICE IN ONE DAY.

667
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO A BETTER LIFE IN PARIS.

668
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
NO, MOTHER.
I'M NOT GOING BACK.

669
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
WHAT?

670
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
NOW I CAN TELL YOU
MY GREAT SECRET.

671
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I INTEND TO STUDY
AND START A SCHOOL HERE

672
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
TO EDUCATE FARMERS'
SONS AND DAUGHTERS.

673
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
NO, CLYM, YOU CANNOT.

674
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
YOU CANNOT THROW AWAY
ALL THOSE YEARS OF STUDY

675
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
AND PROSPERITY IN PARIS.
WHAT FOR?

676
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
TO WIDEN THEIR WORLD,

677
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
BANISH IGNORANCE
AND SUPERSTITION...

678
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
CLYM.

679
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
THE LIKES OF WHICH
MOVED SUSAN NUNSUCH

680
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
TO STAB MISS VYE
IN CHURCH TODAY.

681
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
WELL, PERHAPS
YOU SHOULD KNOW,

682
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
THEY BELIEVE IT WAS
EUSTACIA VYE'S FAULT

683
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
THAT MR. WILDEVE
DALLIED SO LONG

684
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
BEFORE MARRYING
YOUR COUSIN.

685
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
MOTHER, I KNOW.

686
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
MISS VYE
TOLD ME SO

687
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
LESS THAN
AN HOUR AGO.

688
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
THE TRUTH CLEVERLY TOLD
IS THE BIGGEST LIE OF ALL.

689
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
SHE EXPECTED PEOPLE
TO SAY THAT.

690
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
OH, YOU ARE
BLINDED, CLYM.

691
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I WANT YOU TO MEET HER,
GET TO KNOW HER.

692
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
MEET HER?

693
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
NO.

694
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
NO, NEVER.

695
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
THE CRUELEST THING
NEXT TO DEATH

696
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
A MOTHER CAN SUFFER--

697
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
TO SEE AN UNFIT CREATURE

698
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
TAKING OVER THE MIND
AND LIFE OF HER
ONLY SON.

699
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
DON'T MAKE ME SPEAK TO YOU

700
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
IN A WAY
WE WILL BOTH REGRET.

701
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
ARE YOU SURE
WE SHOULD DIG THESE UP?

702
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
OH, CHRISTIAN.

703
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
A FINE SPECIMEN.

704
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
LOOK AT THAT.

705
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
JUST THINK...

706
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
AN ANCIENT DRUID
WAS IN HERE.

707
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
WHAT A CEREMONY
THAT MUST'VE BEEN.

708
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
YOU FOUND THE CHOICEST
OF THE LOT, CLYM.

709
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
SOME MAN'S BONES
BEEN RESTING IN THAT POT

710
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.

711
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
NO MAN RESTS HERE.

712
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
THIS URN HOLDS
A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN,

713
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
WHO DIED OF HEARTBREAK

714
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
BECAUSE HER WORLD
BEGAN AND ENDED

715
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
ON THIS HORRIBLE HEATH.

716
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
YOU'VE DONE HER
A GREAT FAVOR.

717
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
NOW HER SPIRIT
CAN ESCAPE THIS PLACE

718
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
AND SEE WHAT WONDERS
HAVE COME TO PASS.

719
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
HER FIRST STOP
WILL BE PARIS,
NO DOUBT.

720
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK, TIMOTHY?

721
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
WOULDN'T SHE BE
THE PERFECT ONE

722
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
TO JOIN ME IN TEACHING
THE YOUNG ONES
ROUND HERE?

723
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
CLYM,

724
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE
SUCH AN IDEA

725
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
EVER ENTERING HER HEAD.

726
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
HA HA.

727
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I HEAR YOU ATTENDED
THE OPENING OF A BARROW
ON THE HEATH.

728
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
WELL, DID THEY FIND
ANY BURIAL URNS?

729
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
A FEW.

730
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I WOULD'VE LIKED
TO HAVE HAD ONE.

731
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
AS PART OF
THE HISTORY
OF THIS PLACE.

732
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY

733
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
FOR SEEING EUSTACIA VYE
THESE PAST FEW WEEKS.

734
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
YOU KNOW FULL WELL
I GAVE HER THE URN,

735
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
MY SHARE
OF THE EXCAVATION.

736
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
IT'S NOT THE URN
I CARE ABOUT.
IT'S YOU.

737
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
IF NOT FOR HER,
YOU'D HAVE
RETURNED TO PARIS.

738
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
THREE MONTHS
YOU'VE WASTED.

739
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
ABSENT I WAS A HERO,
IN THE FLESH A DISGRACE?

740
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
IN DEFERENCE TO YOU,

741
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I HAVE
DECIDED TO ESTABLISH

742
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
A FINE PRIVATE SCHOOL
IN BUDMOUTH.

743
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
IT MAY NOT
MAKE ME RICH,

744
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
BUT YOU CAN TAKE PRIDE
IN MY REPUTATION
AS AN EDUCATOR.

745
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
DAY AFTER DAY,

746
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
READING, READING,
READING.

747
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
YOU'LL GO BLIND
BEFORE YOU FIND ANYTHING

748
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
TO LIFT THE LOT
OF THESE HEATH PEOPLE.

749
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
THEY'VE BEEN CONTENT
FOR CENTURIES.

750
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
LET THEM HAVE
THEIR GHOSTS
AND THEIR CURSES.

751
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
THERE'S AN ECLIPSE
OF THE MOON TONIGHT.

752
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'M GOING OUT TO SEE IT.

753
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
TELL HER...

754
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
CHRISTIAN CANTLE
SAYS DEAD FOLKS COME
TO CLAIM THEIR OWN

755
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
FROM PEOPLE
WHO KEEP THOSE
BURIAL URNS.

756
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I'D BE ASHAMED
TO LET HER THINK

757
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
MY MOTHER WOULD EVEN
REPEAT SUCH THINGS.

758
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
OH, MY DARLING,
WHAT IS IT?

759
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
WHENEVER YOU'RE
A FEW MINUTES LATE,

760
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I FEAR OUR LOVE IS OVER.

761
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
NEVER.

762
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I KEEP YOU WAITING

763
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
SO I CAN FEEL YOU
CLING TO ME SO
DESPERATELY.

764
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
SHAME ON YOU,

765
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

766
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
IT DOES SEND
THE BLOOD RUSHING.

767
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I CAN FEEL IT.

768
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
YOU'RE MISSING THE ECLIPSE.

769
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
YOU LOOK AT IT.

770
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
TELL ME
WHAT YOU SEE.

771
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
A GREAT AND EXCITING
DISCOVERY.

772
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
IT CHANGED MAN'S
WHOLE VIEW OF THE WORLD.

773
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
COME NOW.

774
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
ALL THAT IN ONE
LITTLE ECLIPSE?

775
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
OH, YES!

776
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I CAN SENSE THE WAY
THAT COPERNICUS

777
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
OR EVEN COLUMBUS
MUST'VE FELT

778
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
WATCHING THAT CURVED
SHADOW OF THE EARTH

779
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
CREEP ACROSS THE MOON

780
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
AND REALIZING
THAT THE WORLD
WAS REALLY ROUND,

781
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
NOT FLAT, AS ALL
THE ANCIENTS SUPPOSED.

782
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
DID YOU SEE IT?

783
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I SEE IT NOW
IN YOUR EYES.

784
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
SOMETHING ELSE...

785
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
SOMETHING
THAT FRIGHTENS ME.

786
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
WHAT ELSE?
WHAT ELSE DO YOU SEE?

787
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
SADNESS.

788
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
YOUR MOTHER KNOWS
OF OUR MEETINGS

789
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
AND SPEAKS
AGAINST ME.

790
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
ALL I KNOW
IS WE CANNOT
GO ON LIKE THIS.

791
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
IT'S NOT SEEING YOU
THAT HAS TO END.

792
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
IT'S PARTING FROM YOU
THAT I CAN NO LONGER
ENDURE.

793
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
BE MY WIFE.

794
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
SPEAK TO ME OF PARIS.

795
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
IS THERE ANY OTHER PLACE
LIKE IT ON EARTH?

796
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
TELL ME OF
THE TUILERIES
AND THE LOUVRE.

797
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I HATE
TALKING OF PARIS.
I'M FINISHED WITH PARIS.

798
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I THOUGHT IT
A SMALL THING TO ASK.

799
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
WELL, THERE IS
ONE SUNNY ROOM
IN THE LOUVRE,

800
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
WHICH WOULD MAKE
A FITTING PLACE
FOR YOU TO LIVE.

801
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
THE GALERIE
D'APOLLON.

802
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
IN THE EARLY MORNING,

803
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
IT IS A PERFECT
BLAZE OF SPLENDOR.

804
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I USED TO VISIT IT
ON SUNDAYS.

805
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
OH, YES.

806
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I DISLIKE
ENGLISH SUNDAYS SO MUCH.

807
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,000
HOW I SHOULD CHIME IN
WITH THEIR MANNERS
OVER THERE.

808
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
WE'LL GO BACK THERE,
WON'T WE?

809
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I HAVE VOWED NOT
TO GO BACK, EUSTACIA.

810
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
YOU KNOW
I PLAN TO TEACH.

811
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I'D RATHER LIVE AND DIE
IN A HERMITAGE HERE

812
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
WITH PROPER WORK TO DO.

813
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
YOU COULD TEACH ENGLISH
IN PARIS.

814
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
IT'S PARIS
YOUR HEART IS SET ON.

815
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I WAS A FOOL
TO THINK IT WAS ME.

816
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
NO, CLYM, NO.

817
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
NO, IT IS YOU.

818
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
YOU'LL NEVER STAY
WITH YOUR PLAN TO TEACH,

819
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I'M QUITE SURE.
WE'LL SOON BE IN PARIS.

820
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
SO I PROMISE YOU...

821
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I PROMISE THAT
I WILL BE YOURS
FOREVER AND EVER.

822
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A YES,

823
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
IF YOU'RE AFRAID
TO SAY IT.

824
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
YES.

825
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
OH, YES.

826
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
YES.

827
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
ANOTHER ROUND,
MR. WILDEVE!

828
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
WHAT IS IT?

829
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
YOU LOOK ILL.

830
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I'VE JUST BEEN
AT THE QUIET WOMAN.

831
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
CAPTAIN VYE ANNOUNCED
THAT YOU AND EUSTACIA VYE

832
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
ARE ENGAGED
TO BE MARRIED.

833
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
AND THEN HE TURNED...

834
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
AND WITNESSED
MY SURPRISE AND SHAME.

835
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I'M SORRY.

836
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
YOU DON'T MAKE IT EASY
FOR ME TO TALK TO YOU.

837
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
YOU ALWAYS MAKE IT SOUND

838
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
AS THOUGH THE SUFFERING
YOU CAUSE ME IS MY FAULT.

839
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I DON'T MEAN TO.

840
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I WISH I NEVER LIVED
TO SEE THIS DAY,

841
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
SEE YOU THROWING AWAY
EVERYTHING...

842
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
FOR HER.

843
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I WON'T SUFFER THIS
ANY LONGER IN MY OWN HOME.

844
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I THINK....

845
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
YOU SHOULD
BESTOW YOUR PRESENCE...

846
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
WHERE YOU BESTOW
YOUR LOVE.

847
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
IF THIS IS THE SIZE
OF MOTHER LOVE,

848
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
THEN I'VE OUTGROWN IT.

849
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I'M STILL YOUR SON
AND WILL SAY NO MORE,

850
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
BUT I'LL NO LONGER
INFLICT MYSELF UPON YOU.

851
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I'LL GO.

852
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I KNEW SHE
WOULDN'T SEE ME.

853
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

854
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I'VE FOUND
A LITTLE COTTAGE.

855
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
WE CAN BE MARRIED
AT ONCE.

856
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I'VE SAVED SOME MONEY
FROM MY POSITION IN PARIS.

857
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
WE'LL GET BY.

858
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
HOW LONG?

859
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
HOW LONG MUST WE LIVE
IN THIS LITTLE COTTAGE?

860
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
SIX MONTHS, PROBABLY.

861
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I'LL HAVE FINISHED
MY READING,

862
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
AND I'LL BE READY
TO WORK IN BUDMOUTH.

863
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
SIX MONTHS.
NO MORE.

864
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
DO YOU PROMISE?

865
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
OF COURSE.

866
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

867
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,000
TELL ME AGAIN
OF THAT ONE SUNNY ROOM
IN THE LOUVRE.

868
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
WHICH ROOM WAS THAT?

869
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
THE ONE THAT WOULD
MAKE A FITTING PLACE
FOR ME TO LIVE.

870
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
FIRST, SET THE DATE.

871
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
A FORTNIGHT...

872
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
BUT TELL ME.

873
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
TELL ME AGAIN
OF THAT ROOM.

874
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
THE GALERIE D'APOLLON.

875
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
IN THE EARLY MORNING
WHEN THE SUN IS BRIGHT,

876
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
THE RAYS
BRISTLE AND DART

877
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
FROM THE GOLD
AND SILVER PLATE,

878
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
TO THE JEWELS
AND PRECIOUS STONES,

879
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
TILL THERE IS
A PERFECT NETWORK
OF LIGHT,

880
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
WHICH QUITE
DAZZLES THE EYE.

881
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
OH, YOU SHOULD'VE COME.

882
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
IT WAS QUITE BEAUTIFUL.

883
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
THAT WEDDING WAS
BORN OF TRICKERY.

884
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
EUSTACIA LOOKED SO HAPPY.

885
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
THEY MAKE
A HANDSOME PAIR.

886
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
CLYM!

887
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I SAW THE GREAT
STEED PEGASUS
OUTSIDE OUR DOOR.

888
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
WE TALKED.

889
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU,

890
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
YOU HAD SMALL HORSE
FOR COMPANY, REMEMBER?

891
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
OF COURSE I REMEMBER.

892
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
IT WAS
THE SAME PONY, CLYM.

893
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I'D LIKE TO THINK
HE BROUGHT YOU TO ME.

894
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
MAYBE HE DID.

895
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
JUST DON'T EVER LET HIM
TAKE YOU AWAY FROM ME.

896
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

897
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
THE LIGHT IN HERE
IS NOT SO GOOD.

898
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I HEARD YOU WERE
STILL ABOUT
ON THE HEATH,

899
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
BUT YOU NEVER
VISIT THE INN.

900
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I HAVEN'T FOUND
THE OCCASION.

901
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
SINCE YOU HAVEN'T
VISITED ME,

902
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I DECIDED
TO VISIT YOU.

903
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
FRIENDS DO THAT,
YOU KNOW.

904
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
WELL, IT'S A PLEASURE
I WASN'T EXPECTING.

905
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
YOU DON'T, UH...

906
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
YOU DON'T LOOK AS
HAPPY AS YOU SHOULD BE.

907
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
OH, WHO IS, DIGGORY?
WHO IS?

908
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
HUSBANDS WILL PLAY
THE TRUANT, YOU KNOW?

909
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT KNOW SOME WAY
TO KEEP DAMON HOME.

910
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
WELL, THAT'S DIFFICULT...

911
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,000
BECAUSE I CAN'T
IMAGINE ANYONE WANTING
TO LEAVE YOUR SIDE.

912
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I'LL PUT MY MIND TO IT,

913
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
SEE IF THERE
MIGHT BE SOME WAY

914
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
OF KEEPING THE INNKEEPER
IN HIS INN.

915
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
CLYM, COME HERE.

916
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
LOOK AT THE MOON.

917
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I WANT TO KNOW.

918
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
HOW DOES THAT MOON
APPEAR OVER PARIS TONIGHT?

919
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
YOU CAN TELL ME.

920
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
YOU CAN HARDLY SEE IT
THROUGH THE SMOKE
OF CHIMNEYS,

921
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
WITH BUILDINGS BLOCKING
ALMOST EVERY WINDOW.

922
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
'TIS FAR MORE
BEAUTIFUL HERE.

923
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
EUSTACIA.

924
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
OH, CLYM.

925
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
EUSTACIA!

926
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
HELP!

927
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
EUSTACIA!

928
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
HELP!

929
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
EUSTACIA!

930
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
CLYM!

931
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

932
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I CAN'T SEE THE WORDS.

933
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
IT'S ALL BLURRED.

934
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I THINK I'M GOING BLIND.

935
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
BLIND?

936
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
NO!

937
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
NO.

938
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
OH, MY BEAUTIFUL EUSTACIA.

939
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
PLEASE DON'T
LET YOUR FACE
BE LOST TO ME.

940
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

941
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

942
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
OH, NO.

943
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
OH, NO.

944
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
OH, NO.

945
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
"THE 31st OF MAY, 1669.

946
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
"I MUST ENDEAVOR
TO KEEP A MARGIN
IN MY BOOK OPEN,

947
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
"TO ADD HERE AND THERE,

948
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000

"AND THUS END ALL
THAT I SHALL EVER
BE ABLE TO DO

950
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
"WITH MY OWN EYES,

01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
IN THE KEEPING
OF MY JOURNAL."

952
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
SEE? EVEN
THE GREAT SAMUEL PEPYS
WHEN HE WAS BUT 36,

953
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
HAD HIS EYES
FAIL ON HIM.

954
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
IF IT WEREN'T FOR
THESE CURSED BOOKS,

955
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
YOU'D BE BRIGHT-EYED
AND BACK IN PARIS,

956
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
PROSPEROUS,
AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY,

957
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
NOT SITTING HERE
TALKING AS IF
THIS HALF-BLINDNESS

958
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
WAS SOME KIND
OF BLESSING.

959
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
YOU ARE MY BLESSING,
EUSTACIA.

960
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
FATE PUT YOU AT MY SIDE
BEFORE THIS HAPPENED.

961
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I'LL HAVE
A SMALLER SCHOOL
NOW, TRUE,

962
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
BUT I CAN
TEACH FROM MEMORY.

963
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
WE CAN
STILL BE HAPPY.

964
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
GOOD DAY, CLYM!

965
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
IS THAT YOU,
HUMPHREY?

966
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
YES.

967
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

968
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
THAT'S NO SURPRISE BY NOW.

969
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
HALF OF WHAT'S VISIBLE
AIN'T WORTH LOOKING AT,

970
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
WOULDN'T YOU SAY,
MRS. YEOBRIGHT?

971
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I WAS SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR CONDITION.

972
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
IF YOUR WORK WAS
AS LOW CLASS AS MINE,

973
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
YOU COULD GO ON.

974
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
YES.

975
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
YES!

976
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
HOW MUCH DO YOU GET
FOR CUTTING THOSE
FURZE BUNDLES?

977
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
HALF A CROWN
A HUNDRED.

978
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
ON LONG DAYS,
I CAN LIVE WELL
ON THE WAGES.

979
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
THE OUTDOOR EXERCISE

980
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
WILL DO ME GOOD.

981
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I CAN KEEP DOWN
OUR EXPENDITURES.

982
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
WHAT WOULD I NEED?

983
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I CAN LEND YOU
SOME LEATHER LEGGINGS
AND GAUNTLETS

984
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
TILL YOU GET YOUR OWN.

985
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
THEN YOU'LL NEED
A WHETSTONE, A HOOK,
SOME GOOD BOOTS.

986
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
WHEREABOUTS
DO YOU GO THEN?

987
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
THE GALERIE D'APOLLON...

988
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
IN THE EARLY MORNING...

989
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
WHEN THE SUN IS BRIGHT...

990
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
THE RAYS
BRISTLE AND DART...

991
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
UNTIL THERE IS
A PERFECT NETWORK OF LIGHT

992
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
THAT QUITE DAZZLES THE EYE.

993
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
CLYM?

994
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
EUSTACIA?

995
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I COULDN'T
BELIEVE MY EARS.

996
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
SINGING?

997
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
IT'S ONLY
A LITTLE SONG.

998
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
WOULD YOU MIND IF I WENT
TO THE VILLAGE PICNIC
AT EAST EGDON?

999
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
TO DANCE?

1000
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
YES, I SUPPOSE SO. YES.

1001
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
OF COURSE.
IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU.

1002
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
ARE YOU JEALOUS?

1003
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
OF COURSE I'M JEALOUS.

1004
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
IT FRIGHTENS ME TO REALIZE
OTHER MEN NOW TAKE JOY

1005
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
IN A BEAUTY
I CAN NO LONGER SEE.

1006
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
YOU'RE MY HUSBAND.
IS THAT NOT ENOUGH?

1007
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,000
ONLY IF YOU ARE MY WIFE,
WITHOUT REGRET.

1008
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I WON'T STAY LONG.

1009
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I'LL MEET YOU ON THE ROAD
AND BRING YOU HOME.

1010
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
YES.

1011
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
EUSTACIA.

1012
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
DAMON.

1013
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
NO ONE OUT THERE
HOLDS A CANDLE
TO YOU.

1014
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
YOU STARTLED ME.

1015
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
DO YOU STILL
LIKE TO DANCE
AS MUCH AS EVER?

1016
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I THINK SO.

1017
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
WILL YOU
DANCE WITH ME?

1018
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
YOUR HUSBAND
AND MY WIFE
ARE COUSINS.

1019
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
CONSIDER ME
A HARMLESS RELATION.

1020
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
EUSTACIA!

1021
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
WELL, I JUST
DISCOVERED
SOMETHING.

1022
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
AND WHAT
MIGHT THAT BE?

1023
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
WITH OTHERS,
IT'S JUST
EXERCISE.

1024
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
WITH YOU,
DANCE BECOMES
AN ART.

1025
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
WHY, THANK YOU.

1026
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
ALL SUCH EXAGGERATIONS
ARE APPRECIATED THESE DAYS.

1027
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I'M SORRY
TO HEAR
ABOUT CLYM.

1028
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
TRULY.

1029
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
WE ALL THOUGHT

1030
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
HE WAS GOING
TO TAKE YOU
OFF TO PARIS.

1031
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
PARIS WILL HAVE
TO DO WITHOUT ME...

1032
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
FOR THE PRESENT,
AT LEAST.

1033
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
HER LOSS
MORE THAN YOURS,
I'D SAY.

1034
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I MUST BE GOING.

1035
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I'LL WALK YOU HOME
IF YOU WANT.

1036
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
CLYM IS COMING
TO MEET ME PART WAY.

1037
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,000
IF YOU THINK IT
UNWISE...

1038
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
YOU'RE IN
THE WRONG COMPANY

1039
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR WISDOM.

1040
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I THANK YOU FOR
WALKING WITH ME, DIGGORY.

1041
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
WE MAKE GOOD COMPANY.

1042
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
YOU HAVE TROUBLE SEEING,

1043
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
AND I'D JUST AS SOON
NOT BE SEEN.

1044
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
IS SOMEONE COMING?

1045
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
IT'S CLYM.

1046
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
HE'S WITH
DIGGORY VENN.

1047
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I SHOULD GO.

1048
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
NEITHER OF THEM
WOULD BELIEVE
WE MET BY CHANCE.

1049
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
GOOD NIGHT THEN.

1050
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
THAT'S MRS. YEOBRIGHT
AND...

1051
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
SOMEONE ELSE?

1052
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I--I...

1053
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
CAN'T TELL.

1054
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
CLYM, IT IS YOU.

1055
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
MR. VENN.

1056
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
DIGGORY, I LEAVE YOU
TO RETURN WITH A LADY

1057
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
FAR TOO BEAUTIFUL
TO WALK ALONE.

1058
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
DIDN'T ANYONE OFFER
TO WALK WITH YOU?

1059
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
ONE OF THE HEATH PEOPLE
WALKED ME.

1060
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I KNOW SO FEW OF THEM
BY NAME.

1061
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
WELL, I HOPE TO FIND YOU
BETTER SOON, CLYM.

1062
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
GOODBYE TO YOU BOTH.

1063
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
GOODBYE.

1064
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
STRANGE.

1065
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I CAN TRUST

1066
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
TO BRING ME BAD NEWS
WITH GOOD INTENTIONS.

1067
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
YOUR SON'S MISFORTUNE
HAS LED WILDEVE TO SHOW,

1068
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
UH...MORE THAN
CASUAL INTEREST

1069
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
IN EUSTACIA AGAIN.

1070
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
THIS CAN ONLY MEAN
MORE UNHAPPINESS

1071
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
FOR CLYM AND THOMASIN,
I FEAR.

1072
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I PROTESTED AGAINST
THEIR MARRIAGES.

1073
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
THEY DIDN'T LISTEN.

1074
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
NOW I'M TOO WEAK.

1075
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I...I CAN DO NO MORE.

1076
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
MAYBE IF YOU WOULD
MEND WITH YOUR SON.

1077
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I THINK YOUR PRESENCE
WOULD MAKE WILDEVE
WALK STRAIGHTER

1078
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
THAN HE IS
INCLINED TO DO.

1079
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I WILL ADMIT TO YOU,
I HAVE THOUGHT OF IT.

1080
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I SHOULD WISH
TO DIE IN PEACE.

1081
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
HE IS MY ONLY SON.

1082
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
AS FOR THOMASIN,

1083
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I FORGAVE HER
LONG AGO...

1084
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
AND I FORGIVE HIM NOW.

1085
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
YES, PERHAPS
I SHOULD GO.

1086
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
WHY HAVE YOU COME?

1087
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
FOR THE SIGHT
OF YOU AGAIN.

1088
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
WHY IS HE
SLEEPING THERE?

1089
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
HE'S VERY TIRED.

1090
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
HE GOES OUT
AT HALF PAST 4:00
CUTTING FURZE.

1091
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
THE FATES HAVE
TREATED YOU POORLY.

1092
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
CLYM IS A GOOD MAN.

1093
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
MOST WOMEN WOULD GO FAR
FOR SUCH A HUSBAND.

1094
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
YOU DON'T EVEN
BREATHE THE SAME AIR
AS MOST WOMEN.

1095
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
GOD, HOW I ENVY HIM
THAT SLEEP.

1096
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
KNOWING YOU'RE HERE

1097
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
GIVES HIM
THAT PEACE OF MIND.

1098
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I HAVE NOT THAT PEACE.

1099
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
CLYM?

1100
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
IT'S HIS MOTHER.

1101
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
MOTHER?

1102
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
MOTHER?

1103
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
CLYM WILL LET HER IN.

1104
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I SHOULD LEAVE.

1105
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
THIS WAY.

1106
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
TRULY, EUSTACIA...

1107
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I'VE HAD ALL I CAME FOR.

1108
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
GOODBYE.

1109
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
MRS. YEOBRIGHT.

1110
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
MRS. YEOBRIGHT.

1111
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
YOU LOOK AS THOUGH
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

1112
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I'VE SEEN
WHAT'S WORSE...

1113
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
A WOMAN'S FACE...

1114
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
LOOKING AT ME
THROUGH A WINDOWPANE

1115
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
LIKE A STRANGER.

1116
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
YOU WANT ME
TO HELP GET YOU
TO MR. CLYM'S PLACE?

1117
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
IT'S JUST DOWN THERE.

1118
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
NO. I JUST
CAME FROM THERE.

1119
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
THEY WOULDN'T
LET ME IN.

1120
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
WOULDN'T LET YOU IN?

1121
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I'VE BEEN CAST OFF
BY MY SON.

1122
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
WHAT IS IT, JOHNNY?

1123
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
IT'S MRS. YEOBRIGHT.

1124
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I'VE GOT TO GET MR. CLYM.

1125
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
MR. CLYM!

1126
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
MR. CLYM!

1127
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
MR. CLYM!
MR. CLYM!

1128
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
JOHNNY

1129
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
SOMETHING TERRIBLE,
MR. CLYM!

1130
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
EASY, LAD.

1131
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
YOUR MOTHER,
MR. CLYM--

1132
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
ON THE PATH AT
DEVIL'S BELLOWS.
I FOUND HER.

1133
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
SHE'S DEAD, SIR.

1134
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
NO!
SHE IS!

1135
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
EUSTACIA...

1136
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
SHOW ME! SHOW ME!

1137
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
WHERE IS SHE,
JOHNNY?

1138
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
THIS WAY, MR. CLYM.

1139
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
MIND THE BRANCHES, CLYM.
CAREFUL NOW.

1140
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
CLYM.

1141
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
OH...

1142
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
OH...

1143
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I DREAMED
SHE WAS COMING.

1144
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
SHE WAS ON HER WAY
TO MY HOME,

1145
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
BUT SHE COULDN'T
MAKE IT.

1146
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
OH, NO, MR. CLYM.

1147
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
SHE SAID
SHE'D ALREADY BEEN THERE,

1148
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
BUT NO ONE WOULD
OPEN THE DOOR.

1149
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
SHE SAID WHAT?

1150
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
AND SHE SAID,
"I'VE BEEN CAST OFF
BY MY SON."

1151
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
"CAST OFF BY MY SON"?

1152
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
YES, MR. CLYM.

1153
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
JOHNNY.

1154
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
AND SHE ALSO SAID

1155
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
SHE'D SEEN A WOMAN
IN THE WINDOW.

1156
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
CHARLEY, THERE
MUST BE MORE TO IT.

1157
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
THERE'S A STORY ON
THE HEATH, MR. CLYM,

1158
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
THAT SOMEONE WAS SEEN
ENTERING THE HOUSE.

1159
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
WHO?

1160
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I DON'T KNOW. A MAN.

1161
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I DIDN'T
SEE HIM MYSELF.

1162
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
WHO SAW HIM?

1163
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
SUSAN NUNSUCH SAW HIM.
TIMOTHY FAIRWAY SAW HIM.

1164
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
WHO WAS IT?

1165
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I DON'T KNOW. A MAN.
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

1166
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
TELL ME.

1167
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
THERE WAS A MAN HERE.

1168
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
SOME ON THE HEATH
SAW HIM ENTER.

1169
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
TELL ME, OR I'LL--

1170
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
KILL ME?

1171
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
PLEASE DO.

1172
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
THE LIFE
YOU'VE FORCED ME
TO LIVE HERE

1173
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
WOULD MAKE
DYING SEEM EASY.

1174
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I'LL NOT KILL YOU.

1175
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I'LL NOT MAKE YOU
A MARTYR.

1176
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
HOW BEWITCHED I WAS.

1177
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
HOW COULD
THERE BE ANY GOOD

1178
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
IN A WOMAN
EVERYBODY SPOKE ILL OF?

1179
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I CONFESS.

1180
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I WILLFULLY
DIDN'T OPEN THE DOOR
WHEN SHE KNOCKED

1181
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU'D
GONE TO DO IT YOURSELF.

1182
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
THAT IS THE EXTENT
OF MY CRIME TOWARD HER.

1183
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I'VE COMMITTED
NO CRIME AGAINST YOU...

1184
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
EXCEPT FOR A LITTLE
SELF-PITY, PERHAPS.

1185
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I HAVE LIVED ON PROMISES
YOU NEVER MADE.

1186
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
IT'S MY NATURE.

1187
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I HAVE
A HUNGRY IMAGINATION,

1188
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
AND IT STARVED HERE.

1189
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
WAS THE MAN
IN THE HOUSE WILDEVE?

1190
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
OH, CLYM,

1191
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
THE TRUTH WOULD
SPOIL THIS GRAND RAGE
YOU'VE BEEN FEEDING.

1192
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
HERE WE ARE...

1193
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
STILL WITHIN REACH
OF EACH OTHER,

1194
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
BUT THE DARKEST THOUGHTS
A MAN COULD THINK

1195
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
ARE BETWEEN US NOW
FOREVER.

1196
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
GOODBYE.

1197
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
GREAT CHANCES
HAVE BEEN LOST TO US...

1198
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
SINCE THAT...

1199
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
MISTY NIGHT
YOU FIRST SAID...

1200
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
"GOOD EVENING."

1201
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
PEOPLE ASK ME,
"WHO'S THAT OLD MAN

1202
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
LIVING AT BLOOMS"

1203
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
HELLO, THOMASIN.

1204
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
TWO MONTHS NOW,

1205
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
AND EVERY DAY
YOU AGE A YEAR.

1206
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
SEND FOR HER, CLYM.

1207
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I'VE THOUGHT OF IT,

1208
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
BUT THE HURT OF IT ALL
COMES BACK.

1209
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I HAVE HURT, TOO.

1210
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I'M SURE YOU CAN GUESS,

1211
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,000
BUT I NEVER
TURN HOPE AWAY.

1212
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
IF I DON'T
HEAR FROM HER SOON,

1213
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I'LL WRITE TO HER.

1214
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I DON'T REJOICE
IN EMPTY ROOMS.

1215
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
DO IT NOW!

1216
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
TOMORROW'S
THE 5th OF NOVEMBER.

1217
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
THE BONFIRES
WILL BE LIT.

1218
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
MAKE IT AN OCCASION
TO REMEMBER.

1219
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
AH, YOU REMIND ME.

1220
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
THESE NEED CLEANING.

1221
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
A LOADED PISTOL
ATTRACTS DAMPNESS
THIS WEATHER.

1222
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I'VE NEVER MEDDLED
IN YOUR AFFAIRS,
GRANDDAUGHTER,

1223
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
AND I'VE NEVER ASKED
WHAT PASSED BETWEEN YOU.

1224
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I'LL ONLY SAY
YOU APPEARED HAPPIER

1225
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
WHEN YOU HAD HIM
UNDER UNFORTUNATE
CIRCUMSTANCES,

1226
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:44,000
HAPPIER THAN YOU SEEM
NOW THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE HIM AT ALL.

1227
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
MISS EUSTACIA,
TOMORROW NIGHT'S
THE 5th OF NOVEMBER.

1228
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I'LL LIGHT YOU
A ROARING BONFIRE

1229
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
THAT'LL PUT ALL
THE OTHERS TO SHAME.

1230
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
YOU'D LIKE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU NOW?

1231
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
AYE. THERE GO MY BEST
THORN ROOTS AGAIN.

1232
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
EUSTACIA.

1233
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I SAW
YOUR SIGNAL FIRE.

1234
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I HURRIED.

1235
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
CHARLEY LIT IT.

1236
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SIGNAL YOU.

1237
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I'M GLAD
I CAME ANYWAY.

1238
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I'VE DONE YOU
A GREAT HARM,
EUSTACIA.

1239
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

1240
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
NOT YOU.

1241
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
IT'S THIS PLACE.

1242
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
YOU DO NOT DESERVE WHAT
YOU HAVE GOT, EUSTACIA.

1243
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I...

1244
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
IF THERE IS ANYTHING
I CAN DO, NAME IT.

1245
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
ANYTHING
YOU WANT BOUGHT,

1246
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
ANY PLACE
YOU WANT TO GO.

1247
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,000
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE
THIS PLACE ALTOGETHER?

1248
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
YES.

1249
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
YES.

1250
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I'M NOT WANTED HERE.

1251
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
MY HUSBAND
DOES NOT CALL TO ME.

1252
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
IF YOU COULD HELP ME
AS FAR AS BUDMOUTH,

1253
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I CAN GET TO PARIS
MYSELF.

1254
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO BE.

1255
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
SHALL I...

1256
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
COME WITH YOU
TO PARIS?

1257
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
MEET ME AT SHADWATER
AT MIDNIGHT.

1258
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
DRIVE ME TO BUDMOUTH
FOR THE MORNING BOAT,

1259
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
AND I'LL TELL YOU THEN.

1260
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
PLEASE GO NOW.

1261
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
THE NOTION WILL MELT
IF WE TALK ABOUT IT.

1262
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I'LL NOT SAY A WORD
AGAINST IT.

1263
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
TILL MIDNIGHT.

1264
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I'M HOME, JOHNNY.

1265
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
FEELING BETTER?

1266
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
OH, YOU'RE
STILL BURNING.

1267
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I'LL MAKE YOU BETTER,
JOHNNY.

1268
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
YOU'LL BE BETTER NOW.

1269
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
A LETTER
FOR MISS EUSTACIA
FROM MR. CLYM.

1270
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
SHE'S ASLEEP,
BUT SHE'LL BE PLEASED

1271
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
TO HAVE IT
IN THE MORNING.
THANK YOU.

1272
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
MY DEAR EUSTACIA,

1273
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I AM OBEYING MY HEART
IN WRITING TO YOU.

1274
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I BEG YOU TO FORGIVE ME
AND SAY YOU WILL RETURN.

1275
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
COME TO ME.

1276
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
YOUR HUSBAND AS EVER, CLYM.

1277
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
WALK ON.

1278
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
HYAH! HYAH!

1279
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
OH, CLYM!

1280
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
CAPTAIN VYE'S
JUST BEEN TO SEE ME.

1281
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
AT THIS HOUR?

1282
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
EUSTACIA'S DISAPPEARED
FROM HIS HOUSE,

1283
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
AND DAMON
HAS JUST DRIVEN OFF.

1284
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
THEY MAY BE
LEAVING TOGETHER.

1285
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
WHOA!

1286
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
DAMON.

1287
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
DAMON!

1288
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
WHERE IS SHE?

1289
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,000
THERE SHE IS,
ON THE BRIDGE!

1290
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
EUSTACIA!

1291
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
NO!

1292
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
EUSTACIA!

1293
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

1294
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I CAN'T SEE HER!

1295
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
WHERE IS SHE?

1296
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
SHE'S GONE!

1297
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
THERE SHE IS!

1298
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
WHERE?

1299
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I'VE LOST HER!

1300
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
EUSTACIA!

1301
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
SHE'S THERE!

1302
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

1303
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I CAN'T SEE HER!

1304
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
SHE'S IN THE FLOW!

1305
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
NO, DAMON, SHE'S GONE!

1306
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
IT'S TOO LATE!

1307
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
PLEASE, PLEASE, DON'T!

1308
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
THOMASIN, WHAT IS IT?

1309
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
PLEASE, PLEASE!
HELP THEM!

1310
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
PLEASE!

1311
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
DAMON!

1312
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
DAMON, I'M COMING!

1313
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
DAMON!

1314
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
OH, DAMON.

1315
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
DAMON.

1316
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
NO!

1317
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
NO!

1318
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
OH...

1319
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
MY LOVE.

1320
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
MY LOVE.

1321
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I LIED TO YOU,
EUSTACIA.

1322
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I LIED.

1323
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
THE MOON ABOVE PARIS
IS BEAUTIFUL.

1324
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
IT IS.

1325
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
EUSTACIA.

1326
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,000

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1335
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE
GETTING A PROPER START.

1336
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
DO THEY LOOK HAPPY?

1337
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
AYE, HAPPY
AND THEN SOME.

1338
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
YOU OUGHT TO GO IN
AND JOIN THEM.

1339
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
IT'S YOUR HOUSE.

1340
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.
WOULD YOU SAY
THEY MISSED ME?

1341
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
NOT A BIT
IN THE WORLD.

1342
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
TO DIGGORY AND THOMASIN--

1343
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE.

1344
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
OH, CHARLEY,
I ALMOST FORGOT.

1345
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
FROM THAT FIRST DAY
I CAME CALLING AT
MISTOVER KNAP--

1346
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
DO YOU REMEMBER?

1347
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
YES, SIR, I DO.

1348
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I COULD TELL
YOU WERE FOND
OF MISS EUSTACIA.

1349
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
HERE'S A TRESS
OF HER HAIR.

1350
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I THINK
SHE'D LIKE YOU
TO HAVE IT.

1351
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
SHE OFTEN MENTIONED
YOU WERE KIND TO HER.

1352
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
AND SO I TEACH,

1353
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
NOT FROM ANY CREED
OR SYSTEM OF PHILOSOPHY,

1354
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
BUT FROM THE OPINIONS
AND THE ACTIONS

1355
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
COMMON TO ALL GOOD MEN.

1356
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I TEACH BECAUSE...

1357
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
TO TEACH IS TO LEARN...

1358
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:29,000
TO LEARN THAT LOVE CAN
ONLY BE GIVEN, NEVER TAKEN,

1359
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
TO LEARN THAT
ONE SHOULD FORGIVE QUICKLY

1360
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
BECAUSE TIME IS SHORT,

1361
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
TO LEARN THAT TRUE BEAUTY,
LIKE THE BEAUTY OF TRUTH,

1362
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,000
NEVER DIES.

1363
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
EUSTACIA?

1364
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
MY EUSTACIA.

1365
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
AS YOU KNOW,

1366
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
MY DEAR FRIENDS,

1367
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000

1368
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I CAN NOW ONLY DIMLY SEE.
