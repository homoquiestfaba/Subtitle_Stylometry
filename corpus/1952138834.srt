1
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,485
...B boys and B girls,
hustlers, ballers

2
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,820
and shot callers,
welcome to the Women's

3
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,157
18-and-under State Volleyball
Championship finals.

4
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,826
It's gonna be an exciting event,
so trust me,

5
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,828
you don't want to miss this one.

6
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,664
Forget about the last play.
Focus on the next.

7
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,333
Nervous?

8
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,601
Dying.

9
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,347
Never make
the same mental mistake twice.

10
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,349
How long before game time?

11
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,350
Four hours.

12
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,290
Don't get it twisted.
This is not a game.

13
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:49,135
Be vocal, be ready,
be aggressive.

14
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,370
And be on time.

15
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,038
I'm ready, Ma.

16
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,040
Come on, girl.
We got to get to the game.

17
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,884
Is that Gabby?

18
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,219
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

19
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,220
Ladies, that's a what?

20
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,821
A mess.
A mess.
So over it.

21
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,227
Sorry, chola,

22
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,562
Lauren had
them first.

23
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,897
Better to be achola
than a fake-ass wannabe.

24
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,166
That's the last pair I have,
I'm afraid.

25
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,067
I got plastic.

26
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,403
Cash spends faster.

27
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,406
Can't y'all cut it in half?
You wear one half?

28
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,407
You ain't got that much butt.

29
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,242
Come on!
I gotta go get some help!

30
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,578
You guys are killing
Tommy Trojan.

31
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,845
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

32
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,914
Oh, my God.

33
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,249
Laila Ali--
this is crazy.

34
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,584
What are you
doing here.

35
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,252
Well, I'm recruiting
for SC now.

36
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,587
I knew you were
a great boxer,

37
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,522
but I didn't know you
could play volleyball.

38
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,091
Are you kidding?
23 kills per game
her senior year.

39
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,759
First team All Pac-10.
First team All Pac-10.

40
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,094
She was the
captain of SC,

41
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,763
which is like the Harvard
of college volleyball.

42
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,764
I mean, you were so good.

43
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,266
Youareso good.

44
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,601
Thank you.

45
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,868
Suckass.

46
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,769
So how many

47
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,605
scholarships you think

48
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,872
they'll be giving
away next year?

49
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,874
I'm not really supposed to say.

50
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,611
Just one.

51
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,447
But look,
I'll tell you what.

52
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,951
Whoever wins the finals tonight
gets the sacred shorts. Deal?

53
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,119
Deal.

54
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,721
Okay, so play hard,

55
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,290
play for each other

56
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,293
and play for the butt shorts.

57
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,295
And remember,
volleyball, boxing,

58
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,297
it's all about the footwork.

59
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,800
Are y'all ready?!

60
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,910
Ladies and gentlemen,

61
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,811
now the main event.

62
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,482
The final matchup of State
Volleyball Championship.

63
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,486
Here from the Palos Verdes
peninsula,

64
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,155
a sports powerhouse,
from Villa Madonna Academy,

65
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,157
the Madonnas!

66
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:55,161
And from the heart of L.A.,

67
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,764
a school that has produced
college athletes,

68
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,999
a cornerstone
in the world of volleyball

69
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,669
and the Cinderella story
of this year's tournament,

70
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,670
please welcome

71
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,005
Las Chicas Bonitas,

72
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,008
Mexicanas y Boriquas,

73
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,343
the Phantoms

74
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,679
from Cathedral High!

75
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,013
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

76
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,364
Gabby Espinosa boxing about!

77
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,032
Ready to knock 'em out tonight,
folks!

78
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,034
Whoo!

79
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,045
These two cross-town rivals
like each other about as much

80
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,380
as 50 Cent likes Fat Joe.

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,383
And trust me when I say you want
to fasten on your seat belts,

82
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,552
because it's about
to get bananas.

83
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,220
Get going, baby!

84
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,155
Come on, Gabby!
It's on you!

85
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,727
1-2-3 Madonnas!

86
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,591
All right, baby.
Check it out, man.

87
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,526
Now, down by two games
at the top,

88
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,094
the Phantoms have battled back--
scraping their way

89
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,097
towards their first
state championship title

90
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,766
in an amazing comeback story.

91
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,768
Come on, Gabby.
It's all you, baby.

92
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,102
Ladies, you're doing
great out there.

93
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,437
Number 7 is killing us.
She's scoring.

94
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,772
We need to close
this seam.

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,443
Down 13-11.
Can't give up now.

96
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,278
One, two, three, kick ass.
One, two, three...

97
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,379
Kick ass!

98
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,781
Madonnas on three.
One, two, three.

99
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,782
One, two, three.

100
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,116
Madonnas!

101
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,720
Come on, my little angel.
Come on!

102
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,722
Make Daddy proud!

103
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,796
Getting ready to pump it up.

104
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,734
Come on, Becca, you got it.

105
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,402
You got it! Come on!
Go, go, go, go, go!

106
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,418
Mark it down, mamacita!

107
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,986
The Phantoms move ahead.

108
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,924
Now just one point away
from a state championship.

109
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:38,825
Whoo! Whoo!

110
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,493
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!

111
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,836
Cathedral High is looking
more and more like

112
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,771
the little school that could.
Come on!

113
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,007
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

114
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,684
Check it. Her fat ass

115
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,352
is hangin' out her spandex.

116
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,354
Let's go.

117
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,959
Lauren!
Baby, listen to me.

118
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,194
11 is weak on
her left side.

119
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,196
You can beat her left
side every single time.

120
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,197
And you don't let
that trash talk

121
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,866
get inside your head, okay?

122
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,201
Stay a star, okay? Love you.

123
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,537
Brendan, You pound those guys
deep on the baseline.

124
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,872
I've got it.
They are so weak.

125
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,874
Last I checked,
I was the coach.
Got it.

126
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:49,161
Oh! Lefty looks like she just
got hit by a Mack truck!

127
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,563
Way to go, Lauren!

128
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,898
What a beautiful spike

129
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,900
by Lauren McDonald

130
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,235
who leads this match
with 18 kills.

131
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,904
Somebody call her Charles Manson

132
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,572
because she's murdering them
tonight, folks!

133
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,012
Is that all you got, gringa?
Let's find out.

134
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,915
Point goes to Villa Madonna
and it's desperation time now.

135
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,183
They need every point

136
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,585
just to stay alive.

137
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,187
The Phantoms are just one side
away from a championship.

138
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:22,929
I got it! I got it!

139
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,196
Keeps it alive.

140
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,431
Setting up for another spike.

141
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,432
Oh, it's blocked.

142
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,767
They save it.

143
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,202
What an incredible
over-the-back shot!

144
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:34,941
Called for it. It's in the air.
Lauren McDonald keeps it in. Oh!

145
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,776
Oh, another block
and it's going out of bounds.

146
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,377
But Espinosa's there.

147
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,780
She called for it, gets it.
Oh, but it's not enough.

148
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,115
The point goes to the Madonnas.

149
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,450
It's still a one point game,

150
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,788
but if Villa Madonna loses
any rally, it's over.

151
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,122
It's okay, Momi. It's okay.

152
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,481
It's a rocket.

153
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,917
Oh, but it's out of bounds.

154
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,085
Cathedral High wins!

155
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,487
Incredible!

156
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,830
When they write a book on this,
they're sure to call it an epic.

157
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:34,500
This is like watching
Antonio Montana inScarface.

158
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,270
It's incredible, man!
Incredible!

159
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,677
At least she played well.
Look, she blew match point.

160
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,345
So whatever you say to her,
don't patronize her.

161
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,347
it's just gonna
make her feel worse.

162
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,682
And the winner

163
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:53,185
of the State 18-and-under
Volleyball Championship

164
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,187
from Los Angeles, California--

165
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,189
Cathedral High!

166
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,525
For those of you
who don't speak any English...

167
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,702
Did you see me?

168
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,704
Oh, Momi, you were just
flying all over the place.

169
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,373
You were spiking, you were
blocking, you were serving.

170
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,043
Oh, my God. You see?

171
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,377
You remember last night?

172
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:22,048
You were so worried about
being bad or being good.

173
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,382
Look at the wolf.

174
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,384
Everybody thinks
he's the villain,

175
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:29,722
but in reality, he blew
and blew and blew...

176
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,391
And got through the wall.
And that was me?

177
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,060
That was you.
That was me out there?

178
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,062
And not just about winning,

179
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,065
but about the feeling
you're feeling right now.

180
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,734
It's the best feeling
ever, Papi.

181
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,403
I swear it is. Thanks, Daddy.

182
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,072
Now, let's go home.

183
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,406
Gimmiecaballito,please.

184
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,076
Oh,caballitofor you
and everything you want.

185
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,411
Number One.
Number One.
Number One.

186
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,080
You guys go on--
I'm just gonna go home

187
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,415
and watch some game film
and crawl inside my covers.

188
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,751
Looks like money can't buy
everything, girls.

189
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,087
Yeah, like
championship trophies.

190
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,757
Bring those butt shorts
back next year.

191
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,425
They look about my size.

192
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,762
They really do. Next year
belongs to us.

193
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,431
How's that feel?
It feels good.

194
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,767
I'm feeling it.
How you feeling Rada?

195
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,435
Hey, yo! Let's do it, man.

196
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,041
? Summer days
just sitting around ?

197
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,610
? But when the sun goes down ?

198
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,545
? I'll be ready to party... ?

199
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,124
You looking at my cards?

200
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,292
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

201
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,627
Hope you guys are
better firefighters

202
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,628
than you are
card players.

203
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,896
La Rosa!

204
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,899
So, I heard y'all been really
kicking some butt out there.

205
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,467
You ain't know?
You need to ask somebody.

206
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,136
We beat the Madonnas
three times.

207
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,738
I told you, them girls
ain't got nothing on y'all.

208
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,473
Hey, what's up?

209
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:55,474
Hey.

210
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,144
Hey.

211
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,079
So, where are the ribs?

212
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,247
Chili's.

213
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,649
And what happened to,
"We'll do the cooking, Rosa"?

214
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,251
Come on, live a little.

215
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,486
Anyway, speaking of
holding things down.

216
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:08,821
What's up with your
littlePapi Chulo?

217
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,489
He might stop by a little later.

218
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,158
Hmm.
What?

219
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,492
Nothing.
All right, ready?

220
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,161
I just heard he been going to

221
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,096
all the games and stuff.
Of course.

222
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,664
That's my baby.

223
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:19,665
Okay, the food is ready.

224
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,000
This might
have to be on hold.

225
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,335
'Cause I'm gonna
eat some of that food.

226
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,671
No offense, G.
What's up?

227
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:29,008
But aren't you a little too
short to play ball in college?

228
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,342
It's never stopped me before.

229
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,343
Never.
Never.

230
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,012
Never.
Never.

231
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,680
Never.

232
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,183
The best thing in the world...

233
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:42,521
the best thing in my life...
is to see you play.

234
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,523
You are my hero,mija.

235
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:45,858
Papi,that's my line.

236
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:51,130
I have something for you.

237
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,805
I've been saving it.

238
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:04,210
But I think this is the right
moment to give it to you.

239
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,216
This belonged to your mother.

240
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,219
Last year, I took it
along with me to nationals.

241
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,228
Thank you.

242
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,233
? Siempre que pintas iglesias ?

243
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:33,572
? Pintas angelitos bellos ?

244
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,241
? Pero nunca te acordaste ?

245
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,577
? Hey ?

246
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,180
? De pintar ?

247
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,085
? Un angel negro! ?

248
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,760
Where did that come from?
Oh, my God.

249
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,264
Abuela.

250
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,600
This song is a plea
to a painter.

251
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,937
El pintor.

252
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,940
Even though the
Madonna is white,

253
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,878
please paint me the
angels in black.

254
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,117
Okay, I'm feeling
the remix to come on.

255
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,451
Remix!

256
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,122
? Oh, oh ?

257
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,125
? Yeah, yeah ?

258
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:35,467
? Pintor, pintor ?

259
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,804
? Pintame, pintame, pintame ?

260
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,473
? Pintame ?

261
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,143
? Oh, oh, oh ?

262
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,146
? Pintame angelitos negros ?

263
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,149
? Angelitos negros ?
Get it, girl!

264
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,818
? Angelitos ?

265
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,087
? Pintame, pintame ?

266
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,822
? Pintame, pintame... ?

267
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,826
We now bring you

268
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,494
this late-breaking news report.

269
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,763
A devastating fire has enveloped

270
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,999
the Villa Madonna High School,
home of the Madonnas,

271
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,668
runner-up in the girls'
state volleyball championship.

272
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,004
Hey, that's Lauren
McDonald's school.

273
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,005
And the Madonnas.

274
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,675
What?
How weird is that?

275
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,010
...is still unknown.
How crazy is that?

276
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,012
School is out of session with
students on summer vacation...

277
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,348
Gabby, isn't your dad's
fire station near there?

278
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,349
Yeah, hold up.

279
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,351
That's my dad's territory.

280
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,352
We should go.

281
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,353
We should check it out.

282
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,687
Yo, turn around.
Turn around, Rada.

283
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,201
Yo, Davis!

284
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,869
My dad here?

285
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:44,870
Where's my dad at?

286
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,373
Yo, where's my dad at?

287
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,374
Gabby, I'm sorry.

288
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,376
How'd you get here?
Who told you?

289
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,377
What do you mean?

290
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,712
I'm sorry.

291
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:57,716
There's nothing we could do.

292
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,052
What do you mean you're sorry?

293
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,054
Gabby, he's gone.

294
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,722
Hold up, where's my dad?

295
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,391
Gabby, he's gone.

296
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,392
Where's my dad at?!

297
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,726
No! Where's my dad?!

298
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,062
Papi!

299
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,730
Gabby, no.

300
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,065
Wait, let me go get him!

301
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,400
I know he's in there!

302
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,401
He's in there!

303
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,736
Let me go get him, please!
Gabby, listen to me.

304
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,071
Listen to me.

305
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,674
Papi!

306
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,344
Let me go get him!
Let me go get him!

307
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,578
Please let me go get him!

308
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,913
Let me go get him, please!

309
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:28,914
Papi!

310
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,128
Gabby...

311
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,465
I want to talk to you.

312
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,801
Will you listen to me?

313
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,471
Si, abuela.

314
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,472
I want you to remember

315
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:32,144
that you carry
the best of both parents,

316
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:36,148
your father and your mother,

317
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:42,821
in your heart, in your character
and in your spine.

318
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,827
You remember that?

319
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:35,707
Oh, my goodness.

320
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,376
Come on, guys, we
need to stretch.

321
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,378
No, we don't. We don't even
have a school anymore.

322
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,314
Yeah, but there's
always public school.

323
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,049
Yeah, right.

324
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,984
Do you all remember
when we thought

325
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,486
public school was cool?

326
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,887
Yeah, when we were, like, five.

327
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,822
But there is one spot
open at Piedmont.

328
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,224
Uh, look around.

329
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,559
There's three of us.

330
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,727
This sucks!

331
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,729
We're gonna wind up going
to different schools

332
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,731
and playing on separate teams.

333
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,567
Yeah, but it doesn't
have to be like that.

334
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,235
We can all go
to Cathedral High.

335
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,071
You must be smoking something
if you think

336
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,406
I'm gonna step foot
into that school.

337
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,340
I have standards.

338
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,742
Says the girl who made out
with her yoga instructor

339
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,077
and shoplifts at Versace.

340
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,245
Oh...

341
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,914
I never did...
one of those things.

342
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,751
Well, you know what? The three
of us could rule that school.

343
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,086
It would be ours.

344
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,021
And it's the only place
that accepts all of us together.

345
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,090
Well, do they have AP courses?

346
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,693
They got
a national championship.

347
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,927
Oh, true.

348
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,263
Yeah. And that's what we need.

349
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,270
All right, so, I guess bottom
line is the only way that we can

350
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,273
all stay together
is if we go to Cathedral High.

351
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,274
No.

352
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,275
Absolutely not.

353
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,276
Wait a minute.

354
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,944
Captain of a national
championship team

355
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,780
will get her a spot
at SC, no problem.

356
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,449
Think about that.

357
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,783
Okay, thought about it.

358
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,118
She's going to Piedmont.

359
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,454
Scholarship at SC's
worth $200,000 bucks.

360
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,122
Which is way more
than she'd ever make

361
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,057
in her entire career
playing professional volleyball.

362
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,292
Mom, I don't care about that.

363
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,293
All I want is to play

364
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,628
on a championship team
with my friends.

365
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,963
Lauren, I know how hard it is

366
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,965
to have your senior year
turned upside down,

367
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:10,235
but you've got to think
about your future.

368
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,304
Lauren.

369
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:16,141
Come on, you got
another one in you?

370
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,163
Let's do this.

371
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,671
Oh, Latin boys.

372
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,673
I hear they're super romantic.

373
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,109
Oh, he's kind of hot.

374
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,846
Oh.

375
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,181
But so not your type.

376
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,115
Yeah, right.

377
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,454
Welcome to our house, ladies.

378
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,355
It's nice.

379
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,290
A little crowded,
but, you know.

380
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,028
Really?

381
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:14,633
It wasn't crowded
until you guys got here.

382
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,368
Look, Gabby, we can
do this the easy way,

383
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,036
or we can do this the hard way.

384
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,871
Look, Lauren.

385
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,540
We're gonna do this our way.

386
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,209
See, mama,
this is Phantom territory.

387
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,212
Y'all are just paying rent.

388
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,880
Ew.

389
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,386
What a hooker.

390
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,722
Oh, my God, she's giving tongue
before first period.

391
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,224
Ew.

392
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,559
Like you wouldn't go there.

393
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,561
You wouldn't, would you?

394
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,562
I wouldn't.

395
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,563
Ah.

396
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,567
Move it, move it, guys.
Come on.

397
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,902
Yo, come on.

398
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,238
Come on, come
on, come on.

399
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,573
Got to get right
in there.

400
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,574
All right.

401
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,575
Hurry up, yo.

402
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,910
Please tell me you
got to pee, please.

403
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,911
You know, I'm probably

404
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,246
gonna have to spend
an extra two years in...

405
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,581
Shh!
Come on, come on.

406
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,249
Yo, we ain't got all day.

407
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,917
Here.

408
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,586
Oh, that's disgusting.

409
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:08,920
That is so gross.

410
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,258
Trust me,
it'll be worth it.

411
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,593
Ready?

412
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:16,928
Come on, come on.

413
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,263
Come on, come on, let's go,
let's go. We out.

414
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:23,101
As you all know, season opener
starts in two weeks.

415
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:26,772
Who invited the Barbies?

416
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,774
Ladies, you're late.

417
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,776
Um, we were looking
for a weight room

418
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,110
and we didn't quite find one.

419
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,445
And where's the trainer?

420
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,113
'Cause I need to be
professionally stretched out

421
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,115
so I don't tweak a hamstring.

422
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:41,119
Coach, can we get someone
in here to do our nails

423
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,722
'cause mine are
looking kinda toe-up?

424
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:46,792
All right, ladies.

425
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,127
Have a seat, lady,
you're late.

426
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,462
Practice starts every day,

427
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,130
the same time.
Got it.

428
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,799
And we're on time.

429
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,468
Okay.

430
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,471
Take a look around.

431
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,473
There's a lot of talent
on this field.

432
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,642
That's the good news.

433
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,646
The bad news is I only had
one senior last year.

434
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,649
And I can only carry ten.

435
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:14,986
Some of y'all ain't
gonna be here in six weeks.

436
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,656
Do the math.

437
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,658
Tryouts start right now.

438
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,330
Let's go, move it!

439
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,331
That's it. Good work.

440
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,333
Hit those cones!
Hit those cones!

441
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,935
Tryout starts right now!

442
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:33,839
This is not a game!

443
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,840
Coach, me, too?

444
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,107
Yes, you, too!

445
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,276
I want everybody doing push-ups!

446
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,678
How many?

447
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,012
I want
everybody down.

448
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,347
Down!

449
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:43,348
Down?

450
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,617
Down is down.
The ground.

451
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,686
I want everybody down,
down, down.

452
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,622
When I say up, I want
you up. Down.

453
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,860
You want laps or you want this?

454
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,528
Laps.

455
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,196
All right. I want
a hundred laps.

456
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,866
Give me a hundred laps.
Give me a hundred laps.
Are you kidding me?

457
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,201
Huddle up! Huddle up!

458
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,202
Are we done yet?

459
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,538
Are we done yet?
You guys are tired?

460
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,540
You guys are tired?
You want to quit?

461
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,875
No.

462
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,543
You guys tired?
No!

463
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,545
You want to quit?
No.

464
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,546
Well, I'm tired.

465
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,547
Coach, you take it over.

466
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,215
I'm going to go in.

467
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,216
What?

468
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,552
Letters, letters again.
Let's go.

469
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:24,556
Smells like the Metro
in Paris in here.

470
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,224
That a good thing?

471
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,228
Girl, haven't you been anywhere?

472
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,564
Yo, let the Madonnas go first.

473
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,567
You know, since, you guys
have a bus to catch and all.
Thank you.

474
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,405
Man, there's not
any hot water.

475
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,407
This place is
so prehistoric.

476
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,076
At least there's soap.

477
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,418
It's pee-pee!
Ugh!

478
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,687
Oh, my God. That is
so disgusting.

479
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,255
Oh, my God. Like I totally got

480
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,524
like piss all over my hands.
Like, oh, my God.

481
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,093
Don't worry, mama. People's
urine is sanitary.

482
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:05,096
You want some?
You want some of this?

483
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,769
You know what?
What is up with you?

484
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,104
If our school hadn't
burned down,

485
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,041
we wouldn't be
in this dump.

486
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,614
I can't believe
they would even come up
with something like that.

487
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,615
That's disgusting.

488
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,950
Like who would ever...?

489
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,217
Ugh! Please don't do that again.

490
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,285
That was just wrong.

491
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,286
What is her problem?

492
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,955
I don't know. She's
got an attitude.

493
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,289
We'll adjust it.
Don't worry about it.

494
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,962
God, is Gabby ever
in a good mood?

495
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:37,963
Cut her some slack.

496
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:38,964
Her father just died.

497
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,299
He did?

498
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,635
Yeah, he died in the fire
saving your school.

499
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,640
Oh, my God.

500
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,644
Poor girl.

501
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,646
Oh, do you mind?

502
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,654
Come on Gabby, let's walk.

503
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,656
It'll make you feel better.

504
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:05,991
Come on.

505
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,665
Hey, Gabby!

506
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,669
Gabby!

507
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,005
Look, we all just wanted
to say

508
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,340
how sorry we are about what
happened to your dad.

509
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,341
All of us.

510
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,844
Sorry about your dad, Gabby.

511
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:30,115
Whatever.

512
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,617
Yeah, the fire was just awful.
I mean, we all lost something.

513
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,854
I lost my Papi.

514
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,857
And you lost what?

515
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,527
Your cappuccino machines
and your personal trainer?

516
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:47,699
Screw you.

517
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,040
Let's go.

518
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:02,047
All right, ladies, now we're
gonna move on to the part

519
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,050
I know you dread,
but we have to learn it.

520
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,052
It's not difficult.

521
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,387
It's Taylor's Theorem.

522
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,723
We all know what
you can do, Lettie.

523
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,992
Why don't we hear from
some of our new students?

524
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,394
I've seen you ladies
on the court.

525
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,063
Let's apply some of that
aggressiveness here.

526
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,731
Kaitlan, would you like
to give it a try?

527
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,732
No, thanks.

528
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,736
All right. Who wants
to come to the board?

529
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,071
Lauren.

530
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,672
Oh, I actually

531
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,240
haven't finished
writing it down, yet.

532
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,177
My, my, we're
all so shy.

533
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,745
Becca.

534
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,414
Um, can you come back to me
a little bit later, please?

535
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:37,582
All right, Lettie.

536
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,084
Show 'em what you can do.

537
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:43,421
Ladies, you might want
to take some notes

538
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,757
'cause you actually might
learn something today.

539
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,784
Come on, move.
Come on, move it.

540
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:16,788
Wow, I think I'm in love.

541
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,123
Who's that big girl?

542
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,458
I hear she's the best middle
blocker in all of California.

543
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:24,462
Home chicken. Man, that's
my favorite position.
That's my boy. That's my boy.

544
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,131
Watch your mouth.
We're still in school.

545
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,967
Quick, quick, quick feet.

546
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,301
Let's go!
Hit those cones.

547
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,236
The blonde one's
not too bad.

548
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,805
She's a pretty good
volleyball player.

549
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,473
Wait, what about Gabby?
Oh, that's right.

550
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,142
I'm practically married
to Gabby, okay.

551
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,409
I'm looking.

552
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,477
I can look.

553
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,147
Gabby dumped me
again, anyway.

554
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,815
Whew, I'm sick
of this.

555
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,483
Come on.

556
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,485
I thought you guys wanted
to play volleyball?

557
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,988
Music. You feel it? Music.

558
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,323
Hmm, this is our new song.

559
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,658
This is our new song.

560
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:54,659
Um, drumrolls.

561
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,327
Drumrolls,
come on.

562
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,329
We need this song.
We need this song.

563
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:02,667
17, up, 18, up,

564
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:05,336
19, up, 20, up.

565
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:14,345
Ladies, practice was over
a half an hour ago.

566
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,346
Like you said, Coach,

567
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,347
"conditioning is
the key to winning."

568
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,348
I said that?

569
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,349
Yeah.

570
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,518
Then I was right.

571
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,187
Good work.

572
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,188
Thank you.

573
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,026
That workout was hot.

574
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,360
Ooh, hot dogs.

575
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,695
Organic hot dogs.

576
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,364
Did you see the look
on Coach Harlan's face?
Yeah.

577
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,365
We are so in.

578
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:37,869
Hey, Monster. Give the
little flower a flyer.

579
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,204
Ladies, hello.

580
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,873
We're Dos Santos.

581
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,542
Check our band out.
It's tight.

582
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,811
What's up?
I'm the drummer.

583
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,880
Carlos, lead guitarist.

584
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,148
I'll open you doors

585
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,382
to the unknown.

586
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:54,052
Baby, you could call me
Monster, by the way I play.

587
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:57,055
Are you boys even allowed on
this side of the fence?

588
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,723
Not boys,mamacita.

589
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,159
We're men.

590
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,395
Yeah, right.

591
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,397
Vamanos muchachos.

592
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,401
You coming to watch us play?

593
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,907
I'm Artie by the way.

594
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,408
Lauren.

595
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,410
I know.

596
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,681
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

597
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,916
He's so cute.

598
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:58,950
Oh, I'm starving.

599
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,286
I hope we don't have
to wait in line.

600
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,621
Are you kidding?
We never wait in line.

601
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,290
Never, we're
the Madonnas.

602
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,291
Remember?

603
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,292
Club Neema.

604
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:10,628
So this is where
Cathedral High hangs out.

605
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,231
? You in the club
and you ain't scared ?

606
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,134
? Well let me see ya put ya L's
in the air ?

607
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,803
? It's going down tonight... ?

608
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,808
It's so crowded in here.

609
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,810
There we are.

610
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,478
I didn't know
we had a table?

611
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,480
Don't we always?
You're right.

612
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,431
Oh, no. Look who
just walked in.

613
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,333
Who invited them?

614
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,336
He's kind of cute.

615
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,005
Oh, he's kind of cute
right there, too.

616
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,673
Oh my gosh,
I'm going boy crazy.

617
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:56,674
God, you're crazy.

618
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,010
Tell me the truth, did you...?
You told them.

619
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,678
Oh yes. Yes, I so
invited them.

620
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,347
Hey, girls, you want something
to drink?

621
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,015
Oh, yeah.
I'll have a soda.
Okay, gotcha.

622
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:04,949
Two.

623
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,018
All right, I'm
thirsty myself. Gotcha.

624
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:15,360
Oh, uh-uh. Why is she tryin'
to act like she fit in here?
What was that?

625
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,028
Girlfriend, please.

626
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,031
Hi, I would like

627
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,032
to get three drinks.

628
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,033
Coming right up.

629
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,701
How you doing?

630
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,370
I'm fine. Thank you.

631
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,371
I'm Derick by the way.

632
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,705
Oh, I'm Becca.

633
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:28,706
How're you doing?
Nice hat.

634
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,712
What do you think has
more protein grams,

635
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,048
guac and chips
or chili cheese fries?

636
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,050
Have you ever looked at
something and thought

637
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,386
this is everything
I never knew I wanted?

638
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,721
Wait, are we talking
about food or boys?

639
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:44,722
Huh?

640
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,560
Where were you?
You missed our set.

641
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,895
Oh, what time did you go on?

642
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:51,896
7:30.

643
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,899
Check out that chica.
Do you see that?
Oh, yeah.

644
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,235
Watch it, girlfriend.

645
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,904
Looks like the band's got some
new groupie action going on.

646
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:00,905
Please, mama.

647
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,907
All I know is that
if I were her,

648
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,575
I'd be doing something
about that.

649
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,911
Look, I broke up
with him on Tuesday.

650
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,913
You break up every Tuesday.

651
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,915
You know, I was wondering
why you'd name

652
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,850
a band "Dos" anything when
there's three of you?

653
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,252
We're heavy into irony.

654
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,254
Plus we got skills
so we can do that.

655
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,922
I don't
know, prima.

656
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:20,925
I suggest you go handle
that real quick.
Don't...

657
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,860
How did you get those skills?

658
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,929
You know what they say
about practice makes perfect.

659
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,597
I do.

660
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:30,935
Oh, hell no.

661
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,271
Ooh, she's really going!

662
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,608
Arturo, we need to talk.

663
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,120
Thanks for coming though.

664
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,122
Oh, I had fun.

665
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:55,793
I had fun?! I had fun?!

666
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,462
Please tell me
I didn't just sound

667
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:00,465
like some
geeky white girl.

668
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,969
I like the way your outfit
is put together.

669
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,305
I actually tailored my shirt.

670
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,307
Oh, you did? Oh, okay.
Yeah.

671
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,642
So what, you--
you're a designer?

672
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,644
I'm doing a little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

673
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,314
? I feel good ?

674
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,982
? I feel all right ?

675
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,317
? Cruising
through my neighborhood ?

676
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,318
? On a warm summer night ?

677
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,319
? I feel good ?

678
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,321
? That's right ?

679
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,989
? I feel good now ?

680
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,324
? Something about
these summer nights ?

681
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,326
? Summer days
just sittin' around ?

682
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,995
? But when the sun goes down ?

683
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,664
? I'll be ready to party ?

684
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:38,002
? Ain't nothing like
them summer nights ?

685
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,338
? Keep the top on drop
while the girls lookin' hot ?

686
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,673
? Hit the volo
and we just don't stop... ?

687
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:45,009
I can say that when
it comes to designing,

688
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,677
I can make some
mean outfits.

689
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:47,678
Oh, okay.

690
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,680
Uh, come on, Becca.
We need to go.

691
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,682
What are you
talking about?

692
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,351
How're you guys doing?
I'm Derick by the way.

693
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,352
Lauren.
Nice to meet you.

694
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,353
Nice to meet you.

695
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,687
Kaitlan.
Nice to meet you.

696
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,524
So what's up? Are you going
to give me your number?

697
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,525
Can I see your
hand, please?

698
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,193
Here's my number.

699
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,194
Oh, okay.

700
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:07,031
I'm going to make sure
you don't for...

701
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,699
That you don't forget
this though, okay?

702
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,368
So call me, please.

703
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,702
All right. I will do.
Bye.

704
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,038
It was nice to meet
you ladies.
Mm-hmm, bye.

705
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,707
Nice meeting you.
All right.

706
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,377
Girl, that's why you have
been up here all this time.

707
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,645
Well, you know.

708
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,547
Come on, I have got
to get home.

709
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,882
? ...And they're cruising
in their rides ?

710
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,217
? With their ladies
sitting by their side ?

711
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:27,552
? People think we look crazy ?

712
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,887
? But I think
we look classy... ?

713
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,890
Gabby. Gabby.
I don't understand you.

714
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,560
Look, I don't
understand me, either.

715
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,562
Look, you ever wonder
what it'd be like to be

716
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,564
with someone and not
fight all the time?

717
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,899
I mean, we can't even go
a week without fighting.

718
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,234
So?

719
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,904
So, we're bad for each other.

720
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:52,243
What are you saying?

721
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,579
You want us to break up?

722
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,583
No, baby.

723
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:02,253
I--I think we should
stop breaking up.

724
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:06,257
No, you mean we should
stop making up.

725
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:10,094
Tu quieres o no?
Do you love me?

726
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,597
Baby, do you love me?

727
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,972
I want you to be happy.

728
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:27,278
Well, I don't do happy.

729
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,946
Maybe you should
do happy.

730
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,954
If you need me,
just give me a call.

731
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:40,625
What, you think I'll
break down or something?

732
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:44,629
No,porque lo que
no tema tan corta.

733
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,297
Artie, don't give me
that pity stuff,

734
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,966
'cause I don't do
that, either.

735
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,302
Tough girl to the end.

736
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,304
Yeah, that's right.

737
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:58,309
And if anyone asks,
I broke up with you.

738
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,310
Okay.

739
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:03,314
Okay?
Okay.

740
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,982
It's not going to be any
easier being your friend

741
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,985
than it was being your
boyfriend, is it?

742
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,846
I made it!
I made it!

743
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:36,847
Yeah, it's posted.

744
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,182
I told you it would be.

745
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,184
Every year,
11:00 in the morning,

746
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,852
they do it the same every time.

747
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,527
What?

748
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,861
No.

749
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,196
No, don't even.

750
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,197
That's so messed up.

751
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,199
I'm sorry.

752
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,368
How the hell do...

753
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,369
What happened?

754
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,370
It's posted.

755
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,705
Lettie's cut.

756
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,707
So is Gonzales, Perez and Juan.

757
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:03,708
But get this:

758
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,042
all three Madonnas
got rostered.

759
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,644
You gotta be kidding me.

760
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:07,878
I can't believe
they picked Becca.

761
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:11,215
Becca, that bitch.

762
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,717
I don't even know...

763
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,719
Don't even worry about it.
Just leave me alone

764
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,988
because I'm really pissed off
right now and I don't...

765
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:21,392
Oh-oh.

766
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,397
Problem?

767
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,065
Now, you, I understand.

768
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,900
And Kaitlan's a player.

769
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,569
But Becca over Lettie,

770
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,904
who's gotten
just as many kills as Rada?

771
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,573
Yeah, well,
Becca's a great player.

772
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:36,574
Please.

773
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,908
Yeah, believe it.

774
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,510
Harlan's your
coach, sweetheart.

775
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,911
Whatever.

776
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,581
Me and my girls think your girls
bought their way on the team.

777
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:44,849
Yeah, well, my girls...

778
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,251
Think that your girls let their
guard down and got too cocky.

779
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,252
Yeah.

780
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,255
We never let our guard down.

781
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,257
Look, no one's happy to
be in this situation.

782
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,258
Deal with it.

783
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,259
Ladies...

784
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,528
Ciao.

785
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:05,202
? Automatic, supersonic,
hypnotic, funky fresh ?

786
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,438
? Work my body, so melodic ?

787
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,607
? This beat rolls
right through my chest ?

788
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,877
? Everybody, ma and papi,
came to party ?

789
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,946
? Grab somebody,
work ya body, work ya body ?

790
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,882
? Let me see you 1,2 step ?

791
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,950
? Rock it, Don't Stop it ?

792
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,953
? Everybody get on the floor ?

793
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,789
? Crank the party up ?

794
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,391
? We about to get it on ?

795
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:28,893
? Let me see you 1,2 step ?

796
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,995
? I love it when you 1,2 step ?

797
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,797
? Everybody 1,2 step ?

798
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,633
? We about to get it on ?
? This Beat Is ?

799
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,968
? Outrageous, so contagious,
make you crave it ?

800
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,570
? Jazze made it ?

801
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,808
? So retarded, top charted,
ever since the day I started ?

802
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,910
? Strut my stuff
and, yes, I flaunt it ?

803
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,311
? Goodies make the boys
jump on it... ?

804
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,979
Hail, Mary, full of grace.

805
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,981
The Lord is with thee.

806
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,983
Blessed are thou amongst women.

807
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,252
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

808
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,989
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

809
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,825
now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

810
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,493
? ...Let me see you 1,2 step ?

811
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,062
? I love it
when you 1,2 step... ?

812
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:08,833
Nervous?

813
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,100
Me, neither.

814
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,836
Que bueno,you came.

815
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,170
Yeah.

816
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,172
Coach said
I could stay on as manager.

817
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,174
Yo, everybody, look who's here.

818
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,509
You've always been
la chica con cojones.

819
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:19,510
Yeah.

820
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,513
All right, everybody,
gather around.

821
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,181
We're gonna touch
the baby for good luck.

822
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:27,184
Oh, my God, how old do you
think she was when she had her?

823
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:30,521
She probably had herquincenera
in labor and delivery.

824
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,191
Touch the baby
for good luck, everybody.

825
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,868
Lettie, your baby
is so adorable.

826
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,536
She's not my baby.

827
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,871
She's my little sister.

828
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:47,872
Oh.

829
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,306
I watch over her after school.

830
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:52,376
Not everybody can afford
a nanny, you know.

831
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,815
No.

832
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,051
I thought you didn't
like kids.

833
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,720
No, they usually
don't like her.

834
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:23,841
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

835
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,744
the Cathedral High School
women's volleyball team.

836
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,416
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

837
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,084
Let's go, let's go.

838
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,092
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

839
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:45,596
the women's volleyball team from
Mother of Mercy High School.

840
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,769
Oh, my gosh.

841
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,103
Check it out.

842
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,438
The Twin Towers.

843
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,107
I thought they graduated.

844
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,443
They're huge.

845
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:02,046
And that's not something
I get to say very often.

846
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:06,617
Well, let's show those Amazons

847
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,285
who's the queen of the court,
a'ight?

848
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,286
A'ight?

849
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,457
Excuse you.

850
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,459
Why don't you
get off the floor?

851
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,634
Fore, fore, fore!

852
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,806
Point for Mother of Mercy.

853
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,810
Go, Rada!

854
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:38,916
It's yours, Gabby!

855
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,484
Right here!

856
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:44,655
Point, Phantoms.

857
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,490
Yes!

858
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,844
Point for Mother of Mercy.

859
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,184
Point for Mother of Mercy.

860
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,530
Point for Mother of Mercy.

861
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,878
The Phantoms trail 12 to 14

862
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:43,714
in the fifth and final game.

863
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:47,551
Fore, fore, fore!

864
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,219
Come on, fore!

865
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:51,722
There it is!
There it is!
There it is!

866
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,397
Mother of Mercy High School

867
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,901
wins the final game, 15 to 12.

868
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:06,236
Come on!

869
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,905
Hey, the ball was right there.

870
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,843
Lauren... look at me.

871
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,678
Head up. Head up.

872
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:19,516
I told you a
thousand times,

873
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,751
if you can't perform
in the clutch,

874
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,086
you're not gonna
make it to SC.

875
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:25,022
Thanks, Mr. McDonald,
but I'll do the coaching.

876
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,857
Good, you got
your hands full.

877
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:28,692
Yeah, that's true.

878
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:29,760
Hey, I love you.

879
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,095
Go get 'em.

880
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:34,598
You all right?

881
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:35,933
I'm good.

882
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,268
See you in the locker
room, all right?

883
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,301
That was fun.

884
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,636
I had fun.
You guys had fun?

885
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:13,637
I had fun.

886
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,474
Where's the love?

887
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:21,411
Where's the love?

888
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,814
How do you expect to play
as a team if you can't even sit

889
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,483
on the same side of the room
as your teammate?!

890
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,154
You know what?
Hold hands.

891
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,822
Hold hands!

892
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:38,162
Juntos.

893
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,497
Say that.

894
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,432
Say it!

895
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,169
Juntos!

896
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,503
The only way we can win

897
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:50,507
is if we come together
and play as a team.

898
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:51,842
And play for each other!

899
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:53,844
Come on, guys!

900
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:58,849
You've got the talent!

901
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,517
There's more talent on this team

902
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,519
than any team I've ever coached
for or against.

903
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:09,526
From this day forward,

904
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:11,862
we live by one rule
and one rule only:

905
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:15,532
If it brings us together,
it's for us.

906
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:19,536
If it separates us,
it's not for us!

907
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,872
Juntos.

908
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:23,140
We're a team.

909
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:28,212
And you guys are gonna
start feeling the love.

910
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:33,550
I want to feel some love.

911
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,552
I don't feel it.

912
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:49,566
Cabron, at 9:00, okay?

913
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:50,901
Hi, Artie.

914
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,236
Okay, I got to go.

915
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:54,571
Hey.

916
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:55,906
So, uh, what are you doing?

917
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,908
Oh, I have to go work
at a soup kitchen.

918
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,244
Oh.

919
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,913
Why?

920
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,916
My parents are having a little
gathering at this club tonight.

921
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,584
Thought maybe
you'd like to come.

922
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,420
Your parents are renting
a whole club for a party?

923
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,922
No.

924
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,590
They're too cheap for that.

925
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,859
They own the place.

926
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,095
I'll be done by 8:00.

927
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,030
Cool.
Pick you up at 8:00.

928
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,100
Cool.

929
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,769
See you at 8:00.

930
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:30,440
? Baby, baby, baby, baby ?

931
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,776
? Happens all the time ?

932
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:36,113
? Baby, baby, baby, baby ?

933
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:39,116
? Playin' with my mind ?

934
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:43,453
? Baby, baby, baby, baby ?

935
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:47,791
? Making me go crazy ?

936
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,459
? Well, if you call it love ?

937
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,461
? Then love should be a crime ?

938
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,476
? You and me ?

939
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,812
? Suddenly ?

940
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:12,482
? We've got nothin' to say ?

941
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,819
? 'Cause words get in the way. ?

942
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,497
Yeah!

943
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,505
Nice job.

944
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,507
Thanks.

945
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:40,110
He is so amazing.

946
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,847
? Mmm... ?

947
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:46,850
? Oh, yeah, oh, yeah ?

948
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,685
? Well, it's early
in the morning ?

949
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,687
? And my heart
is feelin' lonely ?

950
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:53,690
? Just thinking about you, baby,
got me twisted in the head ?

951
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,025
? And I don't know
how to take it ?

952
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,194
? But it's driving me so crazy ?

953
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,196
? I don't know if it's right,
I'm tossing, turning... ?

954
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:01,198
Can you dance like that?

955
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:02,532
Yeah.

956
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,868
? ...Still can't sleep,
thinkin' about your beauty... ?

957
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:06,203
What kind of music do you like?

958
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:10,374
Um... the kind on the radio.

959
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:13,210
? I think I'm in love ?

960
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,147
? Amor, no es amor... ?

961
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,216
You're kind of geeky,
aren't you?

962
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,552
I like that in a girl.

963
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:25,222
You do?

964
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:27,891
? Amor, no es amor... ?

965
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:31,228
Come on.

966
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:32,829
Expand your horizons.

967
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,065
Oh, I don't know if this
is such a great idea.

968
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,000
? ...That I have in my heart? ?

969
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,235
Come on.

970
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:39,903
? Now I know
you're not my lady ?

971
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,905
? But I'm tryin'
to make this right ?

972
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:43,573
? I don't know what to do ?

973
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,242
? I'm going out of my mind ?

974
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:46,576
? So, baby, if you let me ?

975
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,245
? Kick it with you
then well maybe ?

976
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,579
? We could ride together ?

977
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,581
? We could do this all night ?

978
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:54,584
? Now I don't care
if you've got a man ?

979
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:57,587
? Baby, I wish
you'd understand ?

980
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:03,593
? 'Cause I know he can't love
you right, quite like I can ?

981
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:04,928
? Well, it's 5:00
in the morning ?

982
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,263
? I still can't sleep ?

983
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,599
? Thinkin' about your beauty,
it makes me weak ?

984
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,936
? I'm feelin' hopeless at home ?

985
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:16,940
? Don't know what to do,
I think I'm in love, baby ?

986
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:22,612
? Amor, no es amor ?

987
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,282
? Is this an illusion ?

988
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:29,286
? That I have in my heart? ?

989
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:34,958
? Amor, amor ?

990
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,627
? Oh, yeah, yeah... ?

991
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:44,968
Wonder what's up
with Lauren?

992
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,971
She's not returning my phone
calls or my e-mails.

993
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:50,307
She's probably
busy reshooting
our highlight reel.

994
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,309
Hmm...

995
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:55,645
You know, I kind of miss
the way things used to be.

996
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,981
Yeah, things
are different.

997
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:00,984
In fact,
everything is different.

998
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,153
Cathedral killed us for, like,
three years straight,

999
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:05,489
and I thought for sure
when we went over there,

1000
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,157
I was gonna hate them.

1001
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:09,159
But it's really
not all that bad.

1002
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,161
And the people are kinda cool.

1003
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,764
You wanna know a secret?

1004
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,502
I used to want to go
to Cathedral four years ago.

1005
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:19,836
What?!

1006
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:20,837
Yeah, I really did.

1007
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,173
My father said he didn't think
it would be the same

1008
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,174
as it was when he went.

1009
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:25,675
Shut up.
You never told me that.

1010
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,676
I did!

1011
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:29,513
I mean,
they won every game.

1012
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,848
It was always jumpin'...

1013
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,850
and they had hella boys.

1014
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,852
I was, like, loving it.

1015
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,188
But then, I also thought

1016
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:42,125
that it would make my father
come to more of my games.

1017
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,195
Maybe he will.

1018
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,466
Maybe.
We'll see.

1019
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,875
Seriously, you guys,
we need to work out.

1020
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,877
So I'm about to get a tan
before we leave...

1021
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:04,714
Look, it's three
mamacitas.

1022
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,650
Hola, senoritas!
Hola, senors!

1023
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,553
La comida aqui.

1024
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:10,887
Hand it over.

1025
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:13,557
Why are you wearing those
big-ass pants to the beach?

1026
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,824
Hey, baby.

1027
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,893
They're right here!

1028
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,061
Bam!

1029
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,063
Nice!

1030
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,998
Ooh, nice legs, Monster!

1031
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,733
All right, are we gonna
stand here chitchatting

1032
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,403
withla gringasor are we
gonna get our sweat on?

1033
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:27,404
I'm gonna
get my sweat on.

1034
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:28,738
I don't know
about y'all...

1035
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,575
So, is this workout closed
or can anyone join in?

1036
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,510
It's free, man.

1037
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,679
Can you keep up?

1038
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,013
Can you?

1039
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,349
Let's go.

1040
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,318
How 'bout y'all watch our stuff?

1041
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,720
Don't be eating our food
till we get back

1042
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,055
'cause we're gonna
need that.
Okay...

1043
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,390
Come on, y'all.
Let me see what you got.

1044
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,092
I found my Easter bunny.

1045
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:51,361
Yeah, what's up?

1046
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,382
Second play, guys,

1047
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,217
I think we should
run our middle more,

1048
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,885
that way we can
fake their blocks.

1049
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:58,054
What do you guys
think about that?

1050
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,725
Yo, ma, you got a nice
little view out here.

1051
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,727
You know, little garden
and everything.

1052
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:08,064
You should see the view
from my window.

1053
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,399
You know what I see?

1054
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,067
What?
SC.

1055
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,069
Shut up.
That is so awesome.

1056
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:16,406
I guess. It's like four blocks
away from my house.

1057
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:19,075
Feels like a million miles away,
though.

1058
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,744
Remember what your dad
used to say.

1059
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:23,079
"It's as close as you want it
to be."

1060
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,414
Exactly.

1061
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:27,751
So what we gotta do is kick
butt and win some games.

1062
00:56:58,782 --> 00:56:59,783
Yeah!

1063
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:17,300
You ladies come a long way.

1064
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,302
But to get to the state finals,

1065
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:20,303
we gotta go through
the regionals--

1066
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:21,304
and those girls are tough.

1067
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:22,806
There's only one way
we can get there--

1068
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:23,807
as a team.

1069
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:26,142
And that's what we are now--
a team.

1070
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:30,480
You gotta feel the love.

1071
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,082
Feel the love!

1072
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:34,684
Feel the love!

1073
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,152
Feel the love.
Feel the love!

1074
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,253
Feel it!

1075
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:38,421
Give me a lap!

1076
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:50,166
Come on, ladies! The regionals
are Sunday! Let's go!

1077
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,002
Coach, I'm not feeling the love
at all.

1078
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:59,509
You guys, guess who
got into Stanford!

1079
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,346
Lettie!
Oh, my God!

1080
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:05,515
How did she get in?

1081
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:08,685
She's got a 4.3.

1082
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,692
Is that your new boy toy?

1083
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:20,697
He's a lot less trouble
than a real one.

1084
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,704
Hey, have you heard anything
about that scholarship from SC?

1085
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:28,705
Uh-uh.

1086
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:30,707
Me, either.

1087
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,375
Have you seen our new
highlight reel?

1088
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:35,044
Yeah, like I could
afford that.

1089
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:38,047
What do you care? You don't need
a scholarship to go to school.

1090
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,717
My dad says, "If they don't pay
you, they won't play you."

1091
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,387
Becca.

1092
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:47,056
Becca, wait up.

1093
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,392
You know, you can
habla espanol
all you want to,

1094
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,061
but I'm here to tell you that
you'll never be one of them.

1095
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:53,730
All they do is laugh
behind your back.

1096
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:55,732
What is your problem?
Don't ask what
my problem is.

1097
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:58,067
You know what it is--
you don't return my phone calls,

1098
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,068
you don't text me anymore.

1099
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:01,070
I'm feeling that you're having
too much fun

1100
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:02,005
with your new friends.

1101
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:58,127
Dag, my feet
are killing me.

1102
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,462
What's your problem?

1103
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:01,798
What, you too good
to dance with us?

1104
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,466
No, I just dance
too good.

1105
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:08,805
Okay. I thought Lauren was
the one with the 'tude--

1106
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,139
but, actually, she's okay.

1107
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:12,475
Well, since we're sharing,
there's something

1108
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:15,478
you have to hear on your
new best friend's cell phone.

1109
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:16,813
What's that?

1110
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,149
Feel the love.

1111
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:24,821
Hey, Lauren, what's up?
This is Artie.

1112
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:26,155
I was just
thinking about you.

1113
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,157
Had a good time dancing
with you last night.

1114
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:29,492
I like the way you move...

1115
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,828
She's outside
waiting for you.

1116
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:44,841
What the hell

1117
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:46,142
are you doing with her?

1118
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,510
What difference
does it make?

1119
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,511
Remember?
You dumped me.

1120
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,512
Oh, Gabby, listen.

1121
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,180
Look, you don't even
start with me,

1122
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,181
you backstabbing bitch.

1123
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,182
What, you got close to me

1124
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:54,517
so you could steal
my boyfriend?

1125
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:55,518
I'm not your boyfriend.

1126
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:56,853
Shut up.
You told me

1127
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,187
you guys broke up.

1128
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:59,856
We did!

1129
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:02,859
The two of you disgust me.

1130
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,194
I can't believe her.

1131
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:13,036
What's up, Cathedral?

1132
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,504
Y'all ready to party?

1133
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:17,940
I can't hear.

1134
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,376
I said, y'all ready to party?

1135
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:21,711
Yeah!

1136
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:24,013
If you are say "yeah, yeah."

1137
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,715
Yeah, yeah!
One more time.

1138
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,717
Yeah!

1139
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,391
All right, here's
what we're gonna do.

1140
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,727
If you wanna hear us play,
then I wanna see you sway.

1141
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:39,395
Take your hands in the air

1142
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:41,564
and move 'em
like you just don't care.

1143
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,366
And if you're feeling the heat
and you wanna move your feet,

1144
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,068
then let's kick
it with a phat beat.

1145
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,402
Let's kick it.

1146
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:04,587
Nice set.

1147
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,097
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1148
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:18,468
What is she doing?

1149
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,603
Becca get your head
in the game!

1150
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,071
Focus!

1151
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:44,627
Help!

1152
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,098
Come on! I called help.

1153
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,199
I called
for the ball.

1154
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:51,300
Well, did you get to the ball?

1155
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,136
You were supposed
to be moving your
feet to the ball.

1156
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:55,438
No, you should stop talking
all that yap, yap, yap.

1157
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,140
Don't be putting
your hand in my face.

1158
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,107
I'm sick of you.

1159
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,475
Somebody get her
up off me.

1160
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:00,476
Oh, my God.

1161
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,477
Time out!

1162
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:02,478
Time out!

1163
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,981
Time out Phantoms.

1164
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,049
What's wrong
with you guys?

1165
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,152
Go to the bench, man.

1166
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:10,486
Yeah, go
to the bench.

1167
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:13,489
You, too, man!

1168
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:14,791
I'm sick of this!

1169
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:15,825
Quiet!

1170
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,161
Nobody's talking
in this huddle but me.

1171
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:21,164
What's going on out there?

1172
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:22,398
You guys acting
like the Bad News Bears, man!

1173
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:25,168
Yeah, well you don't
mess with somebody
else's boyfriend.

1174
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:27,804
The last time I checked,
they're not together anymore.

1175
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:31,841
Artie, Artie,
they're fighting
over you, man.

1176
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:33,342
Who's the king of the jungle
now, man?

1177
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:35,011
King Artie!
King Artie!

1178
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,016
Both of y'all need to grow up,
a'ight? Come on.

1179
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:41,851
Now squash this romance novel
stuff

1180
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:43,052
and get out there and play!

1181
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:46,923
You guys are better
than this, man!

1182
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,659
Focus!

1183
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:52,995
On three.

1184
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,697
One, two, three.

1185
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,699
Together.

1186
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:03,039
Hey, Gabby.
Look who's over there.

1187
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,377
And she's taping.

1188
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:09,512
This could be your
highlight reel.

1189
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,214
What do you care?

1190
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,081
SC already has your reel.

1191
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:13,883
You think I wanna look bad
on yours?

1192
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:14,884
Are you twoestupidas
gonna blow

1193
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:16,219
your chance at college
over some guy?

1194
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:17,687
I ain't.

1195
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:32,235
Point for the Phantoms!

1196
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,403
Come on, baby.

1197
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:37,573
They now lead 14 to 12
in the final game.

1198
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:08,271
Out of bounds.
The Phantoms win.

1199
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:22,952
Next stop, the state finals!

1200
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:24,954
Oh, my God.
Doesn't it feel so good?

1201
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,622
Yes, it feels amazing.

1202
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:27,623
We've got
to win state

1203
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:29,292
'cause I have to know
what that feels like.

1204
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:35,131
Becca, I need to talk
to you before you go home.

1205
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:52,648
Becca, you have
more natural ability

1206
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:54,650
than anybody
on this team.

1207
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,652
You won't even use it.

1208
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:57,787
You ever wonder why
you're not starting?

1209
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,289
Yeah, because Gabby's
your go-to girl?

1210
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:03,993
No, it's because I play players
who play

1211
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,995
and who love this game.

1212
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:07,330
You don't want it.

1213
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,498
Yes, I do.

1214
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:12,835
Do you?

1215
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:16,505
What do you want to do?

1216
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:19,175
You know what?

1217
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:22,011
I don't know what I want.

1218
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:25,181
Look, I know your father's
a big-time basketball star

1219
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:28,184
and has his own shoe.

1220
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:31,187
But you've gotta find out
what does Becca want.

1221
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:33,689
What do you want
to do?

1222
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:42,365
You stay on your game
and I'll stay on mine.

1223
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,033
When this is all over,

1224
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:48,037
we'll see who gets custody
of the other boy.

1225
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:50,006
Deal.

1226
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,377
I just had to hear it
from the coach

1227
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:55,378
because of you.

1228
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:57,046
Excuse me?

1229
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:59,382
Yeah, you're trash.

1230
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:00,383
You're never going
to college.

1231
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:01,384
Look at your hair.

1232
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:02,385
Don't touch me!

1233
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:05,721
Hey! Stop it!

1234
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,558
Hey, break it up!
Break it up!

1235
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:11,894
You're going down.

1236
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:12,862
Nobody's going anywhere.

1237
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:13,863
Tell your girl
don't touch me.

1238
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,231
Break it up.

1239
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:16,565
Whatever.
She's going down.

1240
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:22,071
What's wrong
with you guys?

1241
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:24,073
Why are you accusing us?
You think we started this?

1242
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:25,408
You know us better
than that.

1243
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,076
I don't care
who started it.
Stop it!

1244
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:33,082
You guys fight more
than a hockey team.

1245
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,084
Go on home.

1246
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:36,085
That way.

1247
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,593
What is this,
gangster volleyball?

1248
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,262
I need a football team.

1249
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,037
All right, check it out, baby.

1250
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:57,773
The question that's undubitably
marinating around here

1251
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,942
is will Cathedral High,
last year's Cinderella story,

1252
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,645
become this year's
sequel success.

1253
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:06,148
Coach Harlan could actually
jump-start a dynasty

1254
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:07,616
with a second
state championship.

1255
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:10,619
And the Phantoms could write
their own checks

1256
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:12,621
to a great college career

1257
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:14,757
and buy some more of that great
bling bling that we all love.

1258
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,125
Now listen up, guys.

1259
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,794
This could be the dream team
we have all been waiting for,

1260
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:20,930
but they'll have
to battle through

1261
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,965
some contentious contenders.

1262
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:24,467
You guys have to know that

1263
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,802
they're the team to
(beat-boxing) beat.

1264
01:08:58,501 --> 01:08:59,502
You was hungry?

1265
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,170
I was thirsty.

1266
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,305
We're still 30 minutes away
from the opening serve

1267
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:06,008
in today's semifinal
between LA's Phantoms

1268
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,710
and the San Francisco Cougars.

1269
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:11,647
As a matter of fact, here come
the Cathedral High ladies now

1270
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,681
to begin their warmups.

1271
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:14,850
Listen, don't bounce
like bad checks,

1272
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,319
'cause it's gonna be
off the Richter scale.

1273
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:36,205
Hey, ladies!

1274
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,040
How we doing?

1275
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:38,841
I guess
I'm talking to myself.

1276
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,210
I guess I'm talking
to myself.

1277
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,545
Ladies.

1278
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,213
Ah, that's my ladies.

1279
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:45,214
Feel good?

1280
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:46,215
Feel good!

1281
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:47,883
Hey, baby girl.
What's up?

1282
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:50,686
All right, ladies.

1283
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,054
Okay, Gabby, set four.

1284
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:55,357
Set four. Set four.
Set four. Set four.

1285
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:03,532
Hey, are you okay?

1286
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,904
What she doing?

1287
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,072
Are you cool?

1288
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:11,407
Suddenly, I feel
a little sick.

1289
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:12,408
I feel a little sick.

1290
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:13,909
Do you think you can
play through?

1291
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:16,745
Yeah, I can
play through.

1292
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,380
Okay.

1293
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,748
Try it again. Come on, Gabby.

1294
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:21,750
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Set four. Set four. Set four.

1295
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:22,918
All right, right here.

1296
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:26,422
Ow!

1297
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:29,225
Hello?! Is anybody
in there? That hurt.

1298
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,594
This is warm-up.
Get used to it.

1299
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:32,728
What the hell was that?

1300
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,430
Gabby-- what's wrong
with her?

1301
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,731
I don't know.
I don't know.

1302
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:38,767
What the hell was that?

1303
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:39,969
Hmm?

1304
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:41,103
What the hell was that?

1305
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:42,104
What you mean?

1306
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:44,006
You all right?

1307
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:46,075
Yeah, yeah.
I'm good. I'm good.

1308
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,109
All right.
Get your head in the game.

1309
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:48,777
Let's go.

1310
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,779
Focus.
Come on, baby.

1311
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:51,747
All right, guys.

1312
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,115
Come on.
Let's do this.

1313
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:55,117
Yeah, let's go.

1314
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:56,785
Yeah, come on, Gabby.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1315
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:57,786
Set four. Set four. Set four.

1316
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:00,789
Oh, hello.

1317
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:01,790
They're not playing.

1318
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,125
We're playing in here.

1319
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:04,627
What is that?

1320
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:05,794
Was she like that
this morning?

1321
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:06,795
No, of course not.

1322
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,964
You could've hit that.

1323
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:10,499
Gabby, hit the bench.

1324
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:11,634
Becca, you're in for Gabby.

1325
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:12,635
What's your problem?

1326
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:13,636
Gabby, hit the bench.

1327
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,638
Becca, you're
in for Gabby.
What?

1328
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:17,940
Looks like you're out
and I'm in.

1329
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,975
Coach, what are you
talking about?

1330
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:21,644
You can't do this.

1331
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:24,313
You can't do that.

1332
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:25,648
Hit the bench.

1333
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:27,483
Na. I'm good.
Come on.
Hit the bench.

1334
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,485
You, hit the bench.

1335
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:32,988
Get off the court.
Get off the court.

1336
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:34,323
Coach, you can't do this!

1337
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,992
I just...
Coach, take over.

1338
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:39,328
What's wrong with you?
Are you on drugs?

1339
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:40,663
What are you
talking about?

1340
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:43,332
Why you acting...
What's wrong with you?

1341
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:44,333
I'm trying to play.

1342
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,168
You don't want me
to play out there.
I see this.

1343
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:48,170
This is my game!

1344
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:51,173
I've worked my ass off
for this team!

1345
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:52,508
Gabby, calma. Por
favor, calma, Gabby.

1346
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:54,176
Don't touch my face.

1347
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:55,177
Don't...

1348
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:56,512
Don't touch my face.

1349
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,516
Lettie, take Gabby
to the locker.

1350
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:03,185
Your father would be
real proud of you right now.

1351
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:04,520
Don't talk about my father!

1352
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,521
You know better than to...

1353
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,523
Don't, don't...
Gabby!

1354
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,191
Stop it. Stop it.
Don't touch me.

1355
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:10,192
Don't touch me.

1356
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:11,327
Stop it, Gabby.

1357
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,362
Don't touch me.

1358
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:14,697
Come on, Gabby.

1359
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:16,031
Don't touch me!

1360
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,033
Look, I'm getting
back in the game!

1361
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:20,035
Nah, I'm not gonna
take you out the game.

1362
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:22,037
I'm gonna take you off the team.
You're off the team.

1363
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,540
Hit the locker room!
Hit the locker room!

1364
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,708
Don't do this to me.

1365
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,043
You can't do this to me.
You're off the team.

1366
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:29,044
You can't...
Hit the lockers.

1367
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,046
You're off the team.

1368
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:33,716
Whatever.

1369
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,055
All right, ladies, come on!

1370
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:42,391
Go get her.

1371
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:45,060
All right, ladies,
come on, let's go!

1372
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,696
Come on, Becca, let's go!

1373
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,412
Gabby.

1374
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:04,913
Are you okay?

1375
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:06,415
What happened?

1376
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:08,417
Yourtios,your

01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:09,318

Hay no me importa.

Creo que te importa?

1380
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,761
All I want...

1381
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:22,464

1382
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:24,266
I know. Come here.

1383
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,268
Gabby, are you all right?

1384
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:27,269
Abuela!

1385
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:28,604
What happened?

1386
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:33,275
I have to play.

1387
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:35,444
I've got to, I got to play.
No, no, Gabby.

1388
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:36,945
Everything's gonna be okay.

1389
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:38,947
We're gonna stay with you
till the game's over.

1390
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:40,282
Yes, we're staying with you.

1391
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:42,284
Hey, you need anything?
Yeah, go get some ice.

1392
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:48,624
Toda esta bien, mi angelito.

01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,293
Yo estoy aqui contigo.

01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:11,280
Gabby, we won and we're
going to the finals!

1397
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,314
Yes, we won.

01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,982
We won, baby girl.
We won.

1399
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:16,118

Becca, can I speak
to you for a second?

1415
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:52,688
I'll be back.

1416
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,359
Have you seen Gabby?

1417
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:58,694
No.

1418
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:00,028
I'm really worried
about her.

1419
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,697
I can't believe she took drugs.

1420
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:04,366
She didn't.

1421
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:06,368
What do you mean?

1422
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:09,037
I took pills
out of my mother's purse

1423
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:10,372
and poured it
into Gabby's water.

1424
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:11,707
What?!

1425
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,041
Becca, are you nuts?

1426
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,376
Why would you do that?

1427
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,378
Well, at least I didn't
take her boyfriend.

1428
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:18,380
Don't even go there.

1429
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:19,715
I'm sorry.

1430
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:22,050
Gabby took my spot
and blew my chance

1431
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:25,387
of my father coming to see me
play on this team.

1432
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:29,391
Becca, I didn't know it
affected you that way.

1433
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:34,396
But it does not
justify what you did.

1434
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,447
Ladies and gentlemen,
senores y senoritas,

1435
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:28,116
welcome to the Women's State
Volleyball Championships!

1436
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:31,119
It is going to be exciting
here tonight.

1437
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:45,801
Did they get bigger?

1438
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:57,713
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready?!

1439
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,982
It's time for the main event:

1440
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:04,987
the final match for the state
volleyball championship!

1441
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:15,464
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

1442
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,165
playing tonight
for the state championship

1443
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:19,167
top-seeded Mother of Mercy,
that girl looks...

1444
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,502
I'm sorry.

1445
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:23,839
Mother of Mercy takes on
California's Cathedral High!

1446
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:48,163
Come on, baby. Come on.

1447
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:30,472
And you can just feel

1448
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:32,541
the intensity
in the building rising.

1449
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,076
Fans are at the edge
of their seats.

1450
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:37,279
It's about to be
a war zone up in here,

1451
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:38,747
so get your sword and shield
ready,

1452
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,048
'cause it's no-holds-barred
tonight.

1453
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,450
We're off!

1454
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:06,108
Another error by Cathedral High
in this fifth and final game!

1455
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:08,110
The Phantoms have dug themselves

1456
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:09,444
into a deep hole.

1457
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:11,446
Woo! Trailing 11 to four.

1458
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:12,781
They need this right now,

1459
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:14,483
because they're
hanging in the balance.

1460
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:15,951
And when I say hanging,

1461
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,620
I'm talking about
Judas Iscariot, baby!

1462
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,621
Hanging in the balance!

1463
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:24,593
You can see the concern
on the Phantoms faces.

1464
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:27,462
This state championship
could be slipping away.

1465
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:31,600
Ball's up to set.

1466
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,969
It's a smash by Kaitlan!

1467
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:39,775
What a spike!

1468
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,476
Incredible! Incredible!

1469
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:46,481
Third in a row, ticktacktoe!

1470
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,362
Another smash
by Lauren McDonald!

1471
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:03,999
I got it! I got it!

1472
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:05,133
Espinosa with the set.

1473
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:10,172
Score by the Phantoms!

1474
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:13,175
They now lead 12 to 11.

1475
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:16,478
What a comeback!

1476
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:17,879
Mark it down. Mark it down.

1477
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:20,248
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1478
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:23,185
A late call
by the back linesman.

1479
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:24,152
He's ruled the ball out.

1480
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:25,520
He's ruled it out!

1481
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:30,325
The call is gonna stand,
That was in! That was in!

1482
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:32,694
which means the point is
taken away from the Phantoms.

1483
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:36,431
And Mother of Mercy
now leads 12 to 11.

1484
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:40,202
Wait a minute.
Stop everything.

1485
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:42,204
The Phantoms have called
time out.

1486
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:43,538
Are we champions?
Yes!

1487
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:44,539
Are we champions?!

1488
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:45,874
Yes!

1489
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:47,876
Give me one reason
why we should win this thing?

1490
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,544
Because this is the
last time any of us

1491
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:50,879
will ever play together.

1492
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:53,882
Last time some of us
will ever play at all.

1493
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:55,884
Gabby?

1494
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:58,220
I can't imagine it
ending any other way.

1495
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:02,224
And if we win, my parents
are gonna take me to Tahiti.

1496
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:04,559
Just for a week.

1497
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:06,895
One, two, three!

1498
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:09,164
Lose it back!

1499
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:10,198
Hey, you got nine.

1500
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:11,233
I got her.

1501
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:12,567
She ain't got nothing on me.

1502
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:13,568
All right.

1503
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:17,572
You better strap on a jet pack

1504
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:21,243
if you want to get
more air than me.

1505
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:39,628
You want a manicure
to go with that facial?

1506
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:42,764
Wow, what an amazing play

1507
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:44,666
by Gabby Espinosa,
ladies and gentlemen.

1508
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,768
Oh, no, she didn't.

1509
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:48,904
Oh, yes, she did.

1510
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,605
Hola!Say what, say what?

1511
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,741
Watch us kick your butt.

1512
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,944
The Phantoms are celebrating,
but it's a long way to 15.

1513
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:57,779
And they've got to win by deuce.

1514
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:00,448
For those of you that don't
understand, that means two.

1515
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:35,150
That's what I'm talking about!

1516
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,486
Boom shaka-laka!

1517
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:40,488
With Kaitlan in the middle,
you can't go wrong!

1518
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:43,158
I've never seen better
volleyball in my entire life,

1519
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:45,827
ladies and gentlemen!

1520
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:11,152
There she goes again.

1521
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:13,855
And Gabby de la Cruz Gonzales
Guadalupe Mayor

1522
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:15,523
Rodrigues Reyes Espinosa

1523
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:17,525
with an incredible play,
ladies and gentlemen.

1524
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:21,196
What an amazing comeback,
ladies and gentlemen.

1525
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:23,531
The little school that could
is doing it again.

1526
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:27,202
In a spectacular show of
artwork, teamship, the Phantoms

1527
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,237
are one point away
from pulling off a shocker,

1528
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:32,273
coming back from
a seven point deficit.

1529
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,051
Defense. Defense. Defense.

1530
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:47,355
She sets it up.
I got it. I got it.

1531
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:49,724
Oh! Espinosa stumbles,
can't get...

1532
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:51,893
Oh! And the point goes
to Mother of Mercy

1533
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:55,563
as Gabby Espinosa can't
get there in time.

1534
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:58,033
Mother of Mercy's not going to
give it away that easy, folks.

1535
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:00,068
And Cathedral High's
got problems.

1536
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:02,404
Time out!
I got it.

1537
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:04,406
Whoa, there's an injured player
on the court.

1538
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:06,074
Let's see what's
going on over there.
Lauren.

1539
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:08,743
Lauren, come here, baby.
Here's what we got to do.

1540
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:11,079
You got to go down...
Dad, you're fired.

1541
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:13,081
What?

1542
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:15,417
You're fired.

1543
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:17,419
Look, I'm glad you pushed me
all those years,

1544
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:18,553
but this is my game.

1545
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,922
And I'm going
to play it my way.

1546
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:28,763
Look, Lauren, all balls

1547
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:30,098
are coming to you
at an angle, okay.

1548
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:31,099
We need to close the seam.

1549
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,068
You're doing good
out there, ladies.

1550
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:36,771
But, Lettie, we need you
to set for Gabby.
Okay...

1551
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:38,106
I'll watch her.

1552
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:40,775
Thank you, Becca.

1553
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:43,778
Guess I can't stay
a bitch forever.

1554
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,783
Gabby, I want to say to you

1555
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:51,519
that I'm sorry
for what I did.

1556
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,288
I was angry...

1557
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:55,957
I wasn't that nice to you,
either.

1558
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:57,092
Come here.

1559
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:03,131
I missed you.

1560
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:05,800
Enough of the mushy
mushy stuff.

1561
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:09,104
Now we came to do what we do
best and what is that, ladies?

1562
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,806
Kick ass!

1563
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:12,807
Let's do it. guys.

1564
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:14,776
That's what I'm talking about.
Let's go!

1565
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:17,145
I can see that they've
come out re-energized.

1566
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:19,180
Look at the determination
on their faces.

1567
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:21,316
The crowd is on their feet!

1568
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:46,841
Right here.

1569
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:10,498
Lettie, you go!

1570
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,201
You got it, you got it,
you got it!

1571
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:15,036
Line, Lauren, line!

1572
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:24,045
It's in! What a shot
by Lauren McDonald!

1573
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:27,048
The Phantoms win!

1574
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:30,185
They're state champions
for the second time in a row!

1575
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:31,553
What an unbelievable season

1576
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,555
it's been for the Phantoms
this year, guys.

1577
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:36,724
They pushed hard all year
and, boy, did it pay off!

1578
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:38,226
Listen, this is Teebo saying

1579
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:41,396
good night, good riddance
and good luck, everybody.

1580
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:43,731
See you next year!

1581
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:46,401
Come on, let's celebrate!

1582
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:00,081
That's my girl.

1583
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:11,926
One, two, three.

1584
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:14,596
Juntos!

1585
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:27,275
Hey,mamita.

1586
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:29,944
Now was it good for you
'cause it was good for me.

1587
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:32,947
Better than sex...
from what I hear.

1588
01:27:33,281 --> 01:27:35,283
Look, one more thing.

1589
01:27:35,283 --> 01:27:36,618
You earned them.

1590
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:37,885
Thank you.

1591
01:27:38,953 --> 01:27:40,788
You girls did a great job.

1592
01:27:40,788 --> 01:27:41,589
Oh, thank you.

1593
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:42,590
Thank you.

1594
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,092
I guess I'm not the only one

1595
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,793
that knows how to kick
a little butt.

1596
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:47,795
You guys were amazing
out there.

1597
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:51,933
So what does this mean?

1598
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,269
Well, it means it's going
to be tough to decide.

1599
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:58,139
I'll be in touch.

1600
01:27:58,139 --> 01:27:59,474
Thank you.

1601
01:27:59,474 --> 01:28:02,110
Oh, my gosh.

1602
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:11,986
Who do you think
he's waiting for?

1603
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:13,655
It doesn't even
matter anymore.

1604
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:14,989
Come on let's go.

1605
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:19,994
? I wake up at 7:00 on a bright
and sunny morning ?

1606
01:28:19,994 --> 01:28:22,163
? Stumble down, I'm on my way ?

1607
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:24,999
? To meet a friend
at a park downtown ?

1608
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:29,337
? My day is getting brighter,
feeling better by the minute ?

1609
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:32,674
? Then a thought crosses
my mind, it goes like this ?

1610
01:28:32,674 --> 01:28:34,676
? You got to hear it ?

1611
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:45,687
? Even in the end, I'll be
the one that wins, yeah ?

1612
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:52,360
? Where will I be
ten years from tomorrow? ?

1613
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:57,699
? Will I be dressed
like the doll from today? ?

1614
01:28:57,699 --> 01:29:01,035
? Will I succeed
or will I fail? ?

1615
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:03,171
? Tell me, time, tell me, time ?

1616
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,573
? Tell me, time,
tell me, time ?

1617
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:06,641
? Oh ?

1618
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:21,622
? Stopped by the church
on my way home to say a prayer ?

1619
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:23,391
? And I wondered to myself ?

1620
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:26,561
? How many people
are praying out there? ?

1621
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:31,065
? What are they asking for, what
blessings will he give 'em? ?

1622
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:33,101
? Then a voice inside my head ?

1623
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:36,304
? Told me to ask for what
I thought they didn't ?

1624
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:44,245
? So I asked for peace
and I asked for grace ?

1625
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:49,917
? When He answers my prayer ?

1626
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:57,258
? I'll forget all my fears
from yesterday ?

1627
01:29:57,258 --> 01:30:03,931
? Where will I be
ten years from tomorrow ?

1628
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:08,269
? Will I be dressed
like the doll from today? ?

1629
01:30:08,269 --> 01:30:12,440
? Will I succeed
or will I fail? ?

1630
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,442
? Tell me, time, tell me, time ?

1631
01:30:14,442 --> 01:30:16,778
? Tell me, time,
tell me, time ?

1632
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:18,112
? Oh ?

1633
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:24,452
? Seems like it's only time
we're wasting ?

1634
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:28,790
? But it's so much more
than that ?

1635
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:34,462
? It's all we have
and we only get one shot ?

1636
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:38,800
? And we got to make it,
got to win the fight ?

1637
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:44,806
? Where will I be ten years
from tomorrow? ?

1638
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:48,476
? Will I be dressed
like the doll from today? ?

1639
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:53,481
? Will I succeed
or will I fail? ?

1640
01:30:53,481 --> 01:30:55,483
? Tell me, time, tell me, time ?

1641
01:30:55,483 --> 01:30:57,151
? Tell me, time,
tell me, time ?

1642
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:59,153
? Oh ?

1643
01:30:59,153 --> 01:31:06,494
? So I asked for peace
and I asked for grace ?

1644
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:11,499
? When He answers my prayer ?

1645
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:19,173
? I'll forget all my fears
from yesterday ?

1646
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:25,847
? Where will I be
ten years from tomorrow? ?

1647
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:29,851
? Will I be dressed
like the doll from today? ?

1648
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:33,855
? Will I succeed
or will I fail? ?

1649
01:31:34,188 --> 01:31:36,524
? Tell me, time, tell me, time ?

1650
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:38,526
? Tell me, time,
tell me, time ?

1651
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:39,861
? Oh ?

1652
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:46,200
? Seems like it's only time
we're wasting ?

1653
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,871
? But it's so much more

1654
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:55,877

1655
01:31:56,210 --> 01:32:00,214
? And we got to make it,
got to win the fight ?

1656
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:06,888

ten years from tomorrow? ?

1657
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:10,224
? Will I be dressed
like the doll from today? ?

1658
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:15,229
? Will I succeed
or will I fail? ?

1659
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:17,231
? Tell me, time, tell me, time ?

1660
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:19,233
? Tell me, time,
tell me, time ?

1661
01:32:19,233 --> 01:32:20,902
? Oh ?

1662
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:26,908
? Where will I be
ten years from tomorrow? ?

1663
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:30,912

? Only time will tell,
time will tell... ?
