00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:45,499
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]:
There are few who

3
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:48,831
speak of the eerie
happenings that

4
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:51,268
once prowled in this
quiet corner of the state.

5
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:03,411
The truth can be stranger
and more horrifying than what

6
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,977
any man will dream up.

7
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:10,157
[frantic music]

8
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:25,302
I always looked
after my brother.

9
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:32,266
He'd say it was not needed.

10
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:34,050
But that's where he'd be wrong.

11
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:36,270
[downbeat music]

12
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:44,408
The government was giving away
free land to anyone who could

13
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:48,282
live through five winters.

14
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:49,412
I claimed mine.

15
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:57,117
But my brother, he
wasn't interested.

16
00:01:57,247 --> 00:02:01,512
[SINGING] For it's up with
the bonnets of Bonnie Dundee.

17
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:02,794
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]:
He said he was

18
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:06,474
the only doctor for 100 miles.

19
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:10,260
He took his work to heart.

20
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:11,870
Oh, my.

21
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,263
MRS. THOMAS: Is it serious?

22
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:15,439
WILLIAM: Not if it is cared for.

23
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,399
A little poultice will help.

24
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:22,577
Now I want you to rub this
on your foot every morning.

25
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:24,405
MRS. THOMAS: Thank you.

26
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:26,455
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: Everybody
tried to fix him up,

27
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:30,280
but my brother didn't
want to be held.

28
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:33,544
After he lost his wife
in her childbirth,

29
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:35,764
he made his way alone.

30
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:38,158
We're lucky.

31
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:42,510
Lucky to have such a fine
physician in our town.

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,381
You speak generously.

33
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,775
MRS. THOMAS: You deserve more.

34
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:47,905
Your brother too.

35
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,696
Do you know my niece, Ethel?

36
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:56,524
WILLIAM: I do not
believe that I do.

37
00:02:56,654 --> 00:02:59,091
Oh, you must.

38
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:01,485
She's lovely, doctor.

39
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:02,617
I'm expecting her.

40
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:05,794
She'll be here any moment.

41
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:08,710
Wouldn't you like to stay?

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,408
Have a cup of coffee?

43
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:16,457
Thank you, Mrs. Thomas, but I
have many people to see today.

44
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:17,587
I'm sure you have.

45
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:24,029
Strange things have
been happening lately.

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Mm-hmm.

47
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:33,300
You did hear about
Mrs. Kimball's nephew?

48
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,390
In Cherry Vale?

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
He was expected.

50
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:42,657
Expected here last
Sunday supper.

51
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:51,709
They found his horse
yesterday two miles away.

52
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,234
[downbeat music]

53
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:03,982
Oh, here she is.

54
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:06,158
Won't you stay a moment?

55
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,205
Say hello, doctor?

56
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:11,860
WILLIAM: I thank
you kindly, but I...

57
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,070
I really must be on my way.

58
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,484
Good day, ladies.

59
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:29,269
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: I
never understood him,

60
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,490
with his logic and his books.

61
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:34,621
But I loved him.

62
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,801
He taught himself to cook.

63
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:43,283
Pork was his favorite.

64
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:44,693
I reckon because it was easiest.

65
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:50,115
[humming]

66
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:55,295
Time to start
preparing supper, Betsy.

67
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:59,560
Should I go pull some
grains from the garden too?

68
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,911
[screams] Ma!

69
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,825
MR. LONCHER: Get the doctor!

70
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,130
Betsy, go get the doctor!

71
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
BETSY: Doctor!

72
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,494
[bell ringing]

73
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:29,197
Mrs. Loncher?

74
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,290
Mrs. Loncher, I
must sit you upright

75
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:37,467
in order to help you breathe.

76
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:38,729
[bone snapping]

77
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,860
Ma!

78
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:42,298
[downbeat music]

79
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:47,651
MR. LONCHER: Lily!

80
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:49,784
She must have struck
her head as she fell.

81
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:56,225
She was suffocating,
so I adjusted her.

82
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:04,232
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,499
I will fetch the parson.

84
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,023
[downbeat music]

85
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,435
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: It's
hard to keep people alive.

86
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:39,181
You have to feed
them, keep them clean,

87
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:41,226
and you really
ought to love them.

88
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:42,397
MAN: Good evening, doctor.

89
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:55,319
Every time someone passes,
I think about my late husband.

90
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,201
Sometimes you don't
realize how important

91
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:02,857
someone is till they're gone.

92
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,728
Oh, you understand.

93
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:10,038
Your manner's seen tragedy.

94
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:12,606
Yes.

95
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:13,737
I do understand.

96
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:19,264
Biscuits?

97
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:22,050
MR. LONCHER: Take a
letter from me, doctor.

98
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,272
Mother, we are leaving
Independence to be with you.

99
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:33,670
Mr. Loncher, don't you
think you and Betsy would

100
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,629
be better off staying here?

101
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,892
The Osage trail is
notoriously dangerous.

102
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:39,022
[door slamming]

103
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:46,117
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: He
lived for his patients.

104
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:49,033
But he was losing
more than he saved.

105
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:53,864
Mournful solemnities of this day

106
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:59,696
may awaken us to righteousness.

107
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:07,827
Let us not forget that our
days are swiftly passing away.

108
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:17,793
And that every hour
shortens our scanty span.

109
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:20,978
Give us grace to live...

110
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:37,821
BETSY: [humming] [SINGING]
Come fill up my cup

111
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,520
and fill up my can.

112
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,089
Come saddle my horses
and call out my men.

113
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,615
Unhook the West
Port and let us go

114
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:54,751
free, for it's up with the
bonnets of Bonnie Dundee.

115
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,980
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: Even in
all those wide open spaces,

116
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,243
things can disappear.

117
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:10,550
[downbeat music]

118
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:23,867
BETSY: [SINGING] Fill up
my cup and fill up my can,

119
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:28,655
come saddle my horses
and call out my men.

120
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:33,573
Unhook the West Port
and let us go free.

121
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,598
[downbeat music]

122
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:07,128
[SINGING] For it's up with
the bonnets of Bonnie Dundee.

123
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:09,696
WOMAN [VOICEOVER]:
Dear George and Betsy,

124
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:12,960
hope you have not
left Independence.

125
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,617
I am anxious with
worry about you.

126
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:21,838
Send word as soon
as you read this.

127
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:24,275
You are in my constant prayers.

128
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,148
Mother.

129
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:33,458
[downbeat music]

130
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,803
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: I
don't know why he left.

131
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,128
Maybe to find those people.

132
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:07,536
Maybe to save someone again.

133
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,679
Maybe he didn't think he
had that much to lose.

134
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,687
Maybe he was right.

135
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,993
[downbeat music]

136
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,547
MAN: Afternoon, sir.

137
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:05,855
Good afternoon.

138
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:08,379
By any chance, you
seen a man traveling

139
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,686
with a little girl in a wagon?

140
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:11,861
Can't say that I have.

141
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:15,473
Be the first person
I seen in a while.

142
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:17,911
Well, I thank you all the same.

143
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,478
[downbeat music]

144
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:38,171
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: He
must have gone a ways.

145
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:45,503
He must have gone
without eating.

146
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,856
Worked up quite an appetite.

147
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:02,216
And then he saw that sign.

148
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:06,872
Grocry.

149
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,270
He believed in signs.

150
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,492
[knocking at door]

151
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:21,975
Good afternoon, ma'am.

152
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:25,630
I saw your sign.

153
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:28,590
ELVIRA: You need groceries?

154
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,027
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:32,942
For my horse.

156
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:35,945
We have corn.

157
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:37,773
And here's oats.

158
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:39,949
WILLIAM: Some oats, please.

159
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,733
Have you by any
chance seen a man

160
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,024
traveling with a little girl?

161
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:50,220
ELVIRA: A man traveling
with a little girl?

162
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:52,135
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,224
No.

164
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:57,358
I haven't seen them.

165
00:13:57,488 --> 00:14:00,230
WILLIAM: Of course not.

166
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,624
Are you from Independence?

167
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:03,794
WILLIAM: Yes, ma'am, I am.

168
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:08,412
What is your name?

169
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:10,980
I am Dr. William York.

170
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:12,111
Doctor?

171
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:17,245
WILLIAM: I was an assistant
surgeon during the war.

172
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:24,037
Here are my credentials.

173
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,386
I do not read.

174
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:33,481
I know what it's
like to lose someone.

175
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:39,443
You don't settle a country like
this without losing people.

176
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:46,059
You of all people should know,
bad things happen on the Osage.

177
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:52,848
Bandits steal the fat
wallets of travelers.

178
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:58,898
The many who wander off
the trail and never found.

179
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:01,813
Why, I've heard of
nine disappearances

180
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,338
already this year.

181
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:09,865
In the dark, you won't find the
people that you're looking for.

182
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,127
Go to Independence tomorrow.

183
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:15,218
Safely.

184
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,046
[william's stomach growling]

185
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:22,530
[laughs] Well, we
all have to eat.

186
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,836
Yes, ma'am, we all have to eat.

187
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,581
All right then, thank you.

188
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,156
Lodging is $0.15.

189
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,985
And supper is $0.10.

190
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:45,466
Of course.

191
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:48,382
Please, sit down.

192
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:50,950
Thank you, kindly.

193
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,082
ELVIRA: There you are.

194
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:59,523
Doctor, let me introduce
you to my daughter, Kate.

195
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:02,570
This is Dr. York.

196
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,052
Isn't she a lovely girl?

197
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:09,577
Yes, she is.

198
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:12,101
ELVIRA: And very wise.

199
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:15,887
People come from miles
around just to see Kate.

200
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,980
[downbeat music]

201
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:37,126
You and I may have quite
a lot in common, Dr. York.

202
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:38,257
WILLIAM: How is that?

203
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,611
I too am a healer.

204
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:48,616
Really?

205
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:52,054
KATE: The body
holds many secrets

206
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,839
hidden beneath the skin.

207
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,234
They seem mysterious,
but they can be

208
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:04,936
unearthed by the right person.

209
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,640
You're very perceptive, miss.

210
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,252
Medicine is the craft of
looking from the outside

211
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:20,082
and seeing within.

212
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:23,216
Even the most basic
forces keeping us alive,

213
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:27,046
we cannot see them, yet
we know they are there.

214
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:31,223
What are you thinking of?

215
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,055
Pulse, for example.

216
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:40,797
May I?

217
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:48,589
[downbeat music]

218
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:36,332
KATE: You are right, Dr. York.

219
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:37,507
I understand.

220
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:47,822
I am one who has the
power to see many things,

221
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:51,130
the future, the past.

222
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,397
I help others find answers
to their mysteries,

223
00:18:57,527 --> 00:19:00,356
and I bring them
health and happiness.

224
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:04,795
I could be useful if you're
searching for missing people.

225
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:08,843
My profession is one of
science, not the supernatural.

226
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:27,644
My apologies if I have offended.

227
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:35,086
Kate, the doctor is
apologizing to you.

228
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,223
Be a kind hostess.

229
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:54,628
You are forgiven, doctor.

230
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,893
[snickers]

231
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:04,115
Is he your son?

232
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,246
Brother.

233
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:16,171
WILLIAM: One, two, three.

234
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:26,181
One, two, three.

235
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:27,312
Very good.

236
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:33,232
[downbeat music]

237
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:16,497
My father taught me that
when I was a little boy.

238
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:21,367
You see, you can do it too, son.

239
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:22,497
[laughs]

240
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:23,542
Very good.

241
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,117
Good evening, sir.

242
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:45,607
Hello.

243
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:54,313
ELVIRA: Dr. York,
you are our guest.

244
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:57,141
Please, sit in
the seat of honor.

245
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,920
WILLIAM: You are most kind.

246
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:10,633
You met Kate?

247
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,421
WILLIAM: Yes, I met Kate.

248
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,517
She's a beauty, no?

249
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:36,093
No?

250
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:37,486
Yes.

251
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:38,617
She is lovely.

252
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:43,709
ELVIRA: Time to eat.

253
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:58,986
Do you enjoy pork, sir?

254
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:01,510
WILLIAM: Of course.

255
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:04,034
ELVIRA: [humming]

256
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:13,827
KATE: Hungry?

257
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:14,957
WILLIAM: Very.

258
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:20,921
Where's the pork?

259
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:22,052
ELVIRA: Almost ready.

260
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:30,931
[thudding]

261
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:31,801
WILLIAM: [gasps]

262
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:34,369
[frantic music]

263
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:48,296
[screams]

264
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:20,459
[gurgling]

00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,075
[door slamming]

266
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:32,079
[heavy breathing]

267
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:39,478
[ominous music]

268
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,553
There will be others, Kate.

269
00:25:58,252 --> 00:25:59,652
KATE: I thought he
would understand.

270
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:06,521
He almost did.

271
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:08,915
But he mocked me.

272
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:12,048
That was his mistake, not yours.

273
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,128
KATE: I want another chance.

274
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,668
Then you shall have one.

275
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:25,235
[downbeat music]

276
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:55,831
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: Even in
Kansas, a man has to eat.

277
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:00,793
But the food don't
grow on trees.

278
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:08,452
Somebody had to live there.

279
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:12,805
Somebody had to work that soil.

280
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:17,766
But first, somebody had to die.

281
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:18,767
WOMAN: Kate!

282
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:21,117
Miss Bender!

283
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:21,988
Kate!

284
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:23,380
Kate!

285
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:24,860
Miss Bender.

286
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:27,907
[laughs]

287
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:32,999
I want to thank you for helping
us out so much last week.

288
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:34,129
You found your goats?

289
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,787
They were crossing
that creek right

290
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:44,880
by that real big cottonwood
at exactly half past noon,

291
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:47,840
just like you said.

292
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,668
I couldn't believe my eyes.

293
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,717
How'd you know that?

294
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:57,893
How'd you know where they're be?

295
00:27:58,024 --> 00:28:00,069
Consider it my gift.

296
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:08,948
But see, my husband and I,
we had spent the better part

297
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:12,125
of two days looking for them.

298
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:17,130
He thought I was a fool when
I gave you a nickle to listen.

299
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,221
But now, all that
bellyaching's over.

300
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:22,831
He couldn't be happier.

301
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:25,181
[laughs]

302
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:29,403
I am glad you found your goats.

303
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:44,758
You... you are no ordinary girl.

304
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:52,818
I thank you.

[downbeat music]

306
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,199
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: They must
have kept up a good act.

307
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,125
Maybe that was it.

308
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,260
It was all an act.

309
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:50,963
Rehearsed.

310
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:52,834

Boy!

314
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,291
Come here.

315
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:20,513
Here, boy.

00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:33,194

ELVIRA: [sighs]

323
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:13,904
What are you doing, boy?

324
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,342
Gardening?

325
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:18,822
[laughs]

326
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:27,788
Look, look, little green apples.

00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:57,746
It's Sunday.

333
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:07,844
We have all day to
do as we please.

334
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:26,124
What's the matter with you?

335
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,436
You ain't young like Kate.

00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,615
[shouts]

337
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,448
Remember who feeds you.

338
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:16,601
JOHN JUNIOR: Here, piggies.

339
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:30,578
Hey.

340
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:37,325
You done her yet?

341
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:39,806
Ah, pig, you go do her.

342
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:45,898
Pig!

343
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:55,909
What'd you do, boy?

344
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,039
Huh?

345
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:04,178
Huh?

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]:
Unnatural things

351
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:16,811
happened out on the Osage.

352
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:28,306
Was it some sort of a joke?

353
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:38,794
We now know it was a
grave joke they told.

Don't worry, Kate.

You'll find someone

Feeding, going hungry,

been treating it?

370
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:37,364
Oh, of course I've
been treating it,

371
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,236
but I ran out of
poultice two days ago,

372
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:43,544
and the doctor's been away.

373
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:44,675
I have to go inside.

374
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:55,164
Ethel, go get the doctor.

375
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:57,123
He must be back by now.

376
00:41:57,253 --> 00:41:58,254
Yes, Auntie.

377
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:00,518
[downbeat music]

378
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:28,763

[shouting]

380
00:42:37,903 --> 00:42:40,079
[heavy breathing]

381
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:05,669
Mmm.

382
00:43:23,122 --> 00:43:25,559
JOHN: [groans]

383
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:46,972
JOHN JUNIOR: [hums]

384
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:49,539
[downbeat music]

385
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,507
[horse approaching]

386
00:44:49,121 --> 00:44:51,384
ELVIRA: Good afternoon.

387
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:52,907
Good afternoon, ma'am.

388
00:44:53,038 --> 00:44:55,693
ELVIRA: Would you like
to buy some groceries?

389
00:44:55,823 --> 00:44:57,259
OFFICER: No, no thank you.

390
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,393
I would like to speak
with your husband.

391
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:02,874
About what?

392
00:45:03,004 --> 00:45:06,878
Another disappearance,
I'm afraid.

393
00:45:07,008 --> 00:45:10,055
A doctor.

394
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:12,840
Maybe you could be of help
in tracing his whereabouts.

395
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:14,842
No.

396
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:16,322
No, I haven't seen anyone.

397
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:17,852
OFFICER: Let me
describe him to you.

398
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:22,894
Yes, of course.

399
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:24,939
OFFICER: Dr. William York.

400
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:27,072
About 40 years of age.

401
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:34,427
Healthy, dark hair, riding a
bay horse about 15 hands high.

402
00:45:34,557 --> 00:45:37,256
No.

403
00:45:37,386 --> 00:45:38,605
I haven't seen any doctor.

404
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:47,875
Do you have many people
come by here, ma'am?

405
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:49,006
ELVIRA: What do you mean?

406
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,666
Do many people stop here?

407
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:58,712
For groceries?

408
00:45:58,843 --> 00:46:00,322
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:01,453
For groceries.

410
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:08,243
Well, do they?

411
00:46:08,374 --> 00:46:10,419
Yes.

412
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:15,294
Have you seen any man fitting
the description of Dr. York?

413
00:46:15,424 --> 00:46:16,424
ELVIRA: No, I haven't.

414
00:46:31,963 --> 00:46:33,483
ELVIRA: Why, a pocket
watch, of course.

415
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:39,971
That's mighty extravagant
out here on the Osage.

416
00:46:40,101 --> 00:46:43,975
It belonged to my
father before he passed.

417
00:46:44,105 --> 00:46:45,846
It's our most prized possession.

418
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:56,117
Mayor Prentiss is holding
a meeting in Cherry Vale

419
00:46:56,248 --> 00:46:58,032
tomorrow about these
disappearances.

420
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:05,605
I would encourage
your family to attend.

421
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:07,455
ELVIRA: Oh, I think
that would be very wise.

422
00:47:11,176 --> 00:47:14,832
Thank you for letting us know.

423
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:24,189
Good day.

424
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,756
[ominous music]

425
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:49,649
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]:
Hunger has a way

426
00:47:49,779 --> 00:47:51,259
of clouding a man's judgment.

427
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,783
[whistles]

428
00:47:56,264 --> 00:47:58,092
[laughs]

429
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:02,874
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: The tall
grass hides half itself.

430
00:48:05,273 --> 00:48:09,147
For every foot you see,
another foot lies below.

431
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:18,373
[hums]

432
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:34,757
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]:
Dozens of people had

433
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:35,913
vanished around these parts.

434
00:48:40,047 --> 00:48:42,832
Dozens of people had
visited the Benders.

435
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:45,009
[crowd murmuring]

436
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:00,938
[door banging]

437
00:49:07,422 --> 00:49:10,077
I called this meeting to discuss

438
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:13,863
the disturbing disappearances
happening in our midst.

439
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:21,915
These are not the misfortunes of
wayward travelers or transients

440
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:29,488
from afar, but established
families, respected men,

441
00:49:29,618 --> 00:49:33,971
local people have
vanished in fair weather,

442
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:37,975
swallowed by the prairie that
we know to fear and respect.

443
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:44,982
Some blame the devil.

444
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:47,245
Some have been heard
whispering of their neighbors.

445
00:49:51,336 --> 00:49:57,298
We can no longer think of these
events as unlucky coincidence.

446
00:49:57,429 --> 00:50:02,390
Citizens from this county have
been taken by an evil lurking

447
00:50:02,521 --> 00:50:03,521
outside our door.

448
00:50:06,438 --> 00:50:11,660
We must protect each other.

449
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:19,190
Remember how we struggled to
settle this land, what we lost,

450
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,320
who we lost.

451
00:50:22,976 --> 00:50:26,675
Never forget those that we
buried along the journey,

452
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:30,897
for their souls live on
in us and in our children.

453
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:37,904
We have nothing if we cannot
keep our loved ones safe.

454
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:49,176
So in the name of those that
are absent from this room

455
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:53,702
we must fight against any
danger posed to our families.

456
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:58,055
I ask to come forward any
man brave enough to search

457
00:50:58,185 --> 00:50:59,839
out the root of this terror.

458
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:01,101
That's right, Mayor.

459
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:02,624
And I don't know why Sheriff...

460
00:51:02,755 --> 00:51:04,104
Calm down, Charles.

461
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:06,324
We'll get to the bottom of this.

462
00:51:06,454 --> 00:51:08,021
MAN: We've gotta get
somebody out there.

463
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:08,978
MAN: Sheriff.

464
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,111
[interposing voices]

465
00:51:11,242 --> 00:51:14,245
WOMAN: Where are my children?

466
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:16,247
WOMAN: What happened
to my family?

467
00:51:16,377 --> 00:51:18,771
[downbeat music]

468
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:50,063
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: A bender
is a force of nature.

469
00:51:53,762 --> 00:52:01,248
Just as sure as the dirt is
the death beneath our feet.

470
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:03,555
[downbeat music]

471
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:51,464
Like a sunrise, like a sunset,
we come from each other.

472
00:52:57,086 --> 00:53:01,178
Each life built on
another's death.

473
00:53:01,308 --> 00:53:03,484
[knocking at door]

474
00:53:25,637 --> 00:53:28,117
[suspenseful music]

475
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:31,251
EDWIN: Good afternoon, ma'am.

476
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:33,645
ELVIRA: Good afternoon.

477
00:53:33,775 --> 00:53:37,126
I hope I have not
come at a bad time.

478
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:38,257
No.

479
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:41,522
No.

480
00:53:41,653 --> 00:53:43,220
Would you like to
buy some groceries?

481
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:44,350
No, ma'am.

482
00:53:44,438 --> 00:53:46,484
I come looking for someone.

483
00:53:46,614 --> 00:53:50,444
His name is Dr. William York.

484
00:53:50,575 --> 00:53:53,447
Might you know anything
that could be of help?

485
00:53:53,578 --> 00:53:55,971
No, I don't believe I do.

486
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:59,236
But perhaps my daughter, Kate,
could be of some assistance

487
00:53:59,366 --> 00:54:01,063
to you.

488
00:54:01,194 --> 00:54:02,194
Kate?

489
00:54:04,632 --> 00:54:05,632
Kate, we have a visitor.

490
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:10,247
Let me present to you Mr?

491
00:54:13,206 --> 00:54:14,206
York.

492
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:19,473
Mr. York.

493
00:54:19,604 --> 00:54:23,564
KATE: How do you do, Mr. York?

494
00:54:23,695 --> 00:54:26,088
EDWIN: Pleased to meet you.

495
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:29,396
I wonder if you
have by any chance

496
00:54:29,527 --> 00:54:33,487
run across a doctor
from Independence?

497
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:39,798
What is your reason
for inquiring, Mr. York.

498
00:54:39,928 --> 00:54:42,801
I am his brother.

499
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:45,630
KATE: Of course you are.

500
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,069
What do you think
happened to your brother?

501
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:51,199
I really couldn't say.

502
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:59,470
Nobody would leave me,
but I have the strangest

503
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,430
feeling he simply vanished.

504
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:10,655
I believe you, Mr. York.

505
00:55:10,785 --> 00:55:13,048
[downbeat music]

506
00:55:19,054 --> 00:55:27,054
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: Fraternal
and identical ain't the same,

507
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,935
but it's close enough in Kansas.

508
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:35,244
KATE: I think I can
help you, Mr. York.

509
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:38,204
EDWIN: Call me Edwin.

510
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,338
KATE: I will call you
whatever you like, Edwin.

511
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:51,565
I'm reached by many forces.

512
00:55:51,696 --> 00:55:59,696
While others see only to the
horizon, I can see just beyond.

513
00:56:00,879 --> 00:56:04,578
No place is out of my sight.

514
00:56:04,709 --> 00:56:10,410
No soul is out of my reach.

515
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:16,547
Your brother is an honest man.

516
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:19,114
I can feel it.

517
00:56:19,245 --> 00:56:20,464
EDWIN: Yes, he is.

518
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:23,423
KATE: Hard worker.

519
00:56:23,554 --> 00:56:25,904
EDWIN: A very hard worker.

520
00:56:26,034 --> 00:56:29,603
KATE: Caring to his patients.

521
00:56:29,734 --> 00:56:37,176
So caring that he traveled
the trail for them,

522
00:56:37,306 --> 00:56:42,616
though guilt troubled his soul.

523
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:45,097
EDWIN: Do you see him?

524
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:47,578
Do you see my brother?

525
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:48,883
It is fading.

526
00:56:53,932 --> 00:56:54,932
It is gone.

527
00:56:57,892 --> 00:57:00,678
EDWIN: Gone?

528
00:57:00,808 --> 00:57:03,637
Yes.

529
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:05,160
I have lost it.

530
00:57:09,295 --> 00:57:11,471
How do you do that?

531
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:13,647
[laughs]

532
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:20,654
These here are Missouri pippins.

533
00:57:20,785 --> 00:57:23,352
Why, yes.

534
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:26,355
Yes, they are.

535
00:57:26,486 --> 00:57:29,141
Do you tend this orchard?

536
00:57:29,271 --> 00:57:32,666
My father does.

537
00:57:32,797 --> 00:57:33,797
He does well.

538
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:37,671
We are an industrious people.

539
00:57:37,802 --> 00:57:39,717
[suspenseful music]

540
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:54,617
EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: She
thought she was a seer.

541
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:04,002
But she could only see
me in my brother's place.

542
00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:17,449
What a mess.

543
00:58:20,758 --> 00:58:23,674
Would you walk me
to the creek, Edwin?

544
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:24,804
Of course.

545
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:35,982
KATE: [HUMS "WHEN JOHNNY COMES
MARCHING HOME"]

546
00:59:44,537 --> 00:59:46,757
[gentle music]

547
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:36,676
EDWIN: How long has it been
since you staked this claim?

548
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:39,766
KATE: We settled it three
years ago this fall.

KATE: The animals are
healthy and the soil is good,

01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:50,647
but we don't have much,
beside a couple of pigs.

It was quite enjoyable.

Underneath the clouds, blood
dripping from the trees,

733
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:14,994
dripping from the trees, you
think it's just colorful.

734
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:18,563
It's not the changing of the
leaves, changing of the leaves.

735
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:25,309
See where you been and if you
escape, and if you escape.

736
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:31,097
Know that God, your friend,
remember one thing, remember

737
01:18:31,228 --> 01:18:39,228
one thing, oh, beauty is
so delicious, delicious,

738
01:18:40,063 --> 01:18:48,063
beauty is so malicious,
it's a terrible thing

739
01:18:49,637 --> 01:18:57,637
to die for, to die for,
to lie for, to cry for.

740
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:03,608
Think of olden days,
the posse and the clan,

741
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:11,739
the posse and the clan, nothing
good for woman or man, or man.

742
01:19:12,356 --> 01:19:18,579
Out there in Kansas, in the
twister state, twister state,

743
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:22,105
you better be careful.

744
01:19:22,235 --> 01:19:23,715
That's why you wait.

745
01:19:23,846 --> 01:19:26,370
That's why you wait.

746
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:32,855
Beauty can't get
much colder, colder.

747
01:19:32,985 --> 01:19:36,772
Beauty's in the eye
of the beholder.

748
01:19:39,731 --> 01:19:47,731
To die for, to lie for,
to cry for to try for.

749
01:19:56,095 --> 01:19:58,054
Ugly.

750
01:19:58,184 --> 01:19:59,359
Ugly.

751
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:07,490
See beauty, beauty, oh, beauty.
