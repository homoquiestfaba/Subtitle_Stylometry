00:00:00,988 --> 00:00:03,571
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,679
- Hey Ray, nice car you got there.

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,513
- Hi, Maggie.

4
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:44,209
It's confiscated.

5
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,206
Department assigns them to us.

6
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,139
- I've got a pot roast on.

7
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,419
Some nice wine in the fridge,

8
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,619
you free tonight?

9
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,769
(Ray chuckles)

10
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,743
- Sounds great Maggie, but I'm on call.

11
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:57,859
- Well...

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,050
- Some other time, okay?

13
00:01:01,524 --> 00:01:05,159
- I'll give you a call later just in case.

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,694
- Yeah, sure, do that.

15
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:10,278
(upbeat music)

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,239
- Get a life Maggie.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,272
(pager beeps)

18
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:16,856
(upbeat music)

19
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:31,623
(pager beeps)

20
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:34,530
- Oh, Julie.

21
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:36,379
You're in trouble.

22
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,346
Your mother wanted us to
pick out China patterns.

23
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:39,822
- No, can you cover of me?

24
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:40,906
- No problem.

25
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,019
- I'll race you to the car.

26
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,603
(upbeat music)

27
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:03,317
(pager beeps)

28
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:11,269
- Oh, I'm split finger
right down the pike.

29
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,359
- Yeah, we're talking an ugly pitcher.

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,300
- [Tommy] Thing of beauty.

31
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,909
- From an agent wannabe.

32
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,949
- Hey bud, I'll have you know,
when I was in high school,

33
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,989
I was scouted by the Mets.

34
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,969
- Last time you told
it it was the Red Sox.

35
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,919
- I heard it was the Yankees.

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,529
- Yankees, Mets, Red Sox,
Braves, why name them all?

37
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,769
Besides gentlemen, the small discrepancies

38
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,409
in the telling of the tale
do not invalidate the truth.

39
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,529
I was a prospect.

40
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,030
- You married this clown, huh?

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,110
- He was a prospect.

42
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:43,611
(pager beeps)

43
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:49,379
- Ah dad, not today, you promised.

44
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,929
- Son, this beeper may
be my ticket to the bigs,

45
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,253
besides that the Dodgers
need help in the bullpen.

46
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:55,333
Everybody knows that.

47
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,918
- Don't go, please.

48
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,959
Just don't answer.

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,719
- I got you, Mike.

50
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,379
- Bye Pat.

51
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,930
I've been waiting for this one.

52
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,003
- Sorry Carol.

53
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:08,103
See you guys.

54
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,919
- Braves, huh?

55
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,409
Yankees, huh?

56
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,359
Where'd you learn to be such a wise guy?

57
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,469
- Working with you.

58
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,470
You're my idol.

59
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:18,873
(Indistinct chatter)

60
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:21,469
(gun cocks)

61
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,369
- Hey Art, you're looking
downright pika today.

62
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,539
You miss your morning workout.

63
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,919
- Middle of it, when I got to Carol.

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,800
That's one of your damn gigs.

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,633
- why? Yes it is.

66
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:29,466
You're gonna love it.

67
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,299
Matt, tell him.

68
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,624
- You're going to love this one.

69
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,458
- Yeah I'm gonna love it.

70
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,722
- No, this one in particular
is gonna rock your eye.

71
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:35,556
(Art laughs)

72
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:37,219
- [Tommy] Right, let's go.

73
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,519
- Everybody's seated.

74
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,679
All right, listen up everybody.

75
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,009
We got two houses side
by side on the corner,

76
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,639
big vacant lot in the bank.

77
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,539
Now Tommy's been working
on this for over a month.

78
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,139
We got a lot tied up in this.

79
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,819
- How many people inside?

80
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,243
- Well, the informant's been in there,

81
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:55,179
says there's 10 to 15 people
any given time, some guns;

82
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,009
We think they just got
a sizeable shipment.

83
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,950
- The head of Honcho is a guy

84
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:59,610
by the name of Mario Portillo...

85
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,423
- Grande.

86
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:03,079
- Grande, thank you Thomas.

87
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,379
Now, no one, no one talks
to him but me, understood?

88
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,219
Tommy's got warrants with both houses.

89
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,899
I want two SWAT vans in
front and one in the alley.

90
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,890
My squad will back you up.

91
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,890
Let's do it.

92
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,499
- Ready?

93
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:16,499
- I'm ready.

94
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,079
- I'm glad you didn't cut your hair

95
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,681
because I like your hair.
(Tommy laughs)

96
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:26,254
Put you and Grande together five five.

97
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:29,380
(upbeat music)

98
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:32,214

99
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,862

(upbeat music)

102
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:36,210
- All right, let's go in it's show time.

103
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,883
Hit it, hit let's go.

104
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:41,919
(upbeat music)

105
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:01,519
(door bangs)

106
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,053
- [Police] Clear lets go.

107
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:04,392

00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,030
- Hey come back here.

114
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:32,096

(speaks in foreign language)

120
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:49,368
- Freeze!

121
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,360
Don't move.

122
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:52,194
- Get down.

123
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:53,364
Get down on your knees.

124
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:54,694
- Okay.

125
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:55,585
- Okay, lets go on in.

126
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:57,111
- Don't so eager, let's watch it through.

127
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:58,327
- Oh, come on, don't be so old, babe.

128
00:06:58,328 --> 00:06:59,161
Let's go.

129
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:01,640

(speaker speaks indistinctly)

132
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:24,721
(Julie speaks in foreign language)

133
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:26,856
- We've got prisoners walking.

134
00:07:26,857 --> 00:07:27,740

Ray.

That's your man.

151
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:36,475

00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:38,525
- What's your name?

153
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,853
- Don't play games.

154
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,243
You know who I am.

155
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:44,839
- Well tell me anyway.

156
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,547
- Mario portillo Grande.

157
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,139

Tell 'em Matt.

166
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:08,649
We did it.

This is the man.

170
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:17,382
This is the man that buried Grande.

172
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:21,871

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,916
Thank you very much.

175
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,893
- Your attorney's signing in downstairs.

176
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,289
Not too much traffic from
Century City this time of day

177
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,290
is there?

178
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,149
- Don't try to screw with me cop.

179
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,299
I'm not talking till I see him.

180
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,399
- Things don't look too good
for you right now, Mario.

181
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,233
- Really?

182
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:52,439
- Yeah, we got at least two kilos.

183
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,009
You'll go to jail for a long, long time.

184
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,133
- You have nothing.

185
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,653
- That wasn't even my house.

186
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:01,903
- Is that right?

187
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,713
- Yeah, I was just visiting
friends, that's all.

188
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,563
Getting a haircut.

189
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,729
How do you like it?

190
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,219
(Mario scoffs)

191
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,819
- Tommy, this guy's a lot
bigger than we thought he was.

192
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,066
Hell of a job, Jerry, thank you.

193
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,529
You know whose attorney is?

194
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,390
Paul Varjack.

195
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:35,859
- Oh, big daddy.

196
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,319
- Yeah well, even Varjack
can't deny two kilos

197
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,429
in a chicken bucket.

198
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,179
- Yeah, and I made six buys of Mario

199
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,298
at different locations.

200
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:43,132
(phone rings)

201
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,789
Let's say I suggest you refuse bail

202
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,089
and stick it up Varjack's nose.

203
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,090
- Yeah.

204
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,020
- All right, over here.

205
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,029
- What do you wanna do about the girl?

206
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,764
- Let her go, I feel charitable.

207
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:58,072
(phone rings)

208
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:00,354
(police radio chattering)

209
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:02,339
(upbeat music)

210
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,173
- Rose-

211
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:04,248
- Oh, forget about it,

212
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:06,557
painting my porch, I'll buy you a beer.

213
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:07,439
- Thank you.

214
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:08,272
Painting the porch, I'm a gentleman.

215
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:09,105

I just can't sing it.

Neither can Tommy.

00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:32,853
- Come on you guys, I
don't see any you on MTV.

232
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:35,322
- Jesus, Jesus, it's the cops.

233
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:36,156
- [Woman] Captain Nguyen.

234
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:37,249
- Hey can it sir.

235
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,104

236
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:40,519
Ray, can I see you a minute.

237
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,353
- Sure.

238
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:42,549
- Unless you wanna sing some more.

239
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,422
- Lead the way, let's go.

240
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:46,239
- What do you think's up?

241
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,333
- The ceiling is up.

242
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,959
Well, don't worry about this stuff, Matt.

243
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,500
I take care of you don't I?

244
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,539
- Yeah.
Yeah, tell him.

245
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,734
- He takes care of me.

246
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:55,735
- Thank you.

247
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,635
- Heard your group got
Mario Patillo Grande.

248
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,779
- Yeah, well Tommy Quinn made the case.

249
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,537
- How's he working with Matt Fisher?

250
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:05,736
- Mm, great, terrific.

251
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:08,159
I mean they read each other like a book,

252
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,579
and they love each other like brothers.

253
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,659
- [Captain] That's great.

254
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,063
So you're solid?

255
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:14,565
- Oh yeah.

256
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:15,593
Good group.

257
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,689
- Great group.

258
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,919
- Yeah, Tommy we know,

259
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,859
every little kid
fantasize is about fishing

260
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,693
in the majors.

261
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:23,526
- Oh really?

262
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:25,489
No. I wanted to be Mick Jack-

263
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,073
- James Brown, hardest working
man in show business. Ha!

264
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,193
- How's your boat?

265
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:32,193
- Boat?

266
00:12:33,116 --> 00:12:34,419
- Thinking of selling it.

267
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,579
- Barbara didn't take it too?

268
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,139
- Well, let's say she didn't
ask for it in the settlement.

269
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,399
- Divorce is final.

270
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,513
- Six months ago.

271
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,929
During the Christmas day takeout.

272
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,763
But she's terrific.

273
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,719
She's great, she's got
a real estate license.

274
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,309
She's doing wonderful.

275
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,383
And we're still friends.

276
00:12:49,384 --> 00:12:50,889
- [Tommy] Old guy, I'm old-
- Sorry.

277
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,953
- I'm older than you.

278
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:53,537
I'm older than you.

279
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:56,693
- Good group.

280
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,999
- It's a great group.

281
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,833
- You better get back to it.

282
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:03,283
- Yeah, put up the bed.

283
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Take it easy.

284
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,249
- Excuse me, Lieutenant.

285
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,319
I was wondering if you had a chance

286
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,177
to think about what we talked about.

287
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:14,929
- Oh, yeah, as soon as we
have an opening Martinez.

288
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,889
- It's just that I've done
everything I can do in SWAT.

289
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,685
You know, I've got the
best record on my squad.

290
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:20,530
- I'm all about it.

291
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:21,582
I promise you.

292
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,209
I promise as soon as we have it open.

293
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,609
- Okay, I get my first stands sit,

294
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,659
I get my warmup done.

295
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,079
I look up in the stands and there he is.

296
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,439
My father came 200 miles to see me play.

297
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,609
- You're not gonna tell
me you threw a no-hitter.

298
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,639
- Walked the first five batters,

299
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,979
knocked out in the fourth, 12 zip.

300
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,366
That's when he took up singing.

301
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:40,912
(pager beeps)

302
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:41,933
- Here we go again.

303
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,809
- Confirmation, Roger the dodger,

304
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,484
my new pal at the surf shop.

305
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:48,709
- When?

306
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,358
- Tomorrow night, if I could set it up.

307
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,634
- Set it up.

308
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:55,189
- Oh, say I don't suppose
any of you'd be interested

309
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,223
in buying a boat.

310
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,390
- Your boat?

311
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,829
- You're not gonna sell our boat.

312
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,149
- What are we supposed
to do for recreation?

313
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,179
- Gang, I'm selling it.

314
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,323
I am selling it.

315
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:15,002
(phone rings)

316
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,543
Roger, pal, I got clients to serve.

317
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,119
Oh yeah, well I'm not coming down there

318
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,387
if you can't help me out.

319
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,239
All right, I'll be there.

320
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
10 o'clock, yep.

321
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,269
- It's a combination
liquor convenience store

322
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,479
San Pedro across from the port.

323
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,489
Now this parking lot's pretty well lit.

324
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,323
We keep Tommy under out of surveillance

325
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:39,499
while he makes the buy.

326
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,469
Art, I want you to ride with me.

327
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,279
We'll be parked here at
the southeast corner.

328
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,879
Matt, you and Julie, I want here.

329
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,639
Any questions?

330
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,409
- You figure these guys
are gonna be armed?

331
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,243
- Never seen anything on them,

332
00:14:51,244 --> 00:14:53,153
but some gnarly surfboards.

333
00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:54,499
- Well, we assume the worst.

334
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,639
- Guy's not big leagues.

335
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,549
Small time beach kid
ties to the Asian crowd.

336
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,550
- Let's do it.

337
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,353
- You're hot.

338
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:06,353
- I know.

339
00:15:07,457 --> 00:15:10,457
(suspenseful music)

340
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,563
Isn't this a lovely way
to spend an evening?

341
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,779
There's something about parking lots

342
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,919
brings out the best in a man.

343
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,793
- In Tommy's case it's probably true.

344
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:51,899
- You know Tommy thinks
if we play this guy right

345
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,999
he'll give us his connection on the docks.

346
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,020
- I'll make a good caller.

347
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,021
(suspenseful music)

348
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,323
- Hey, across the lot two men.

349
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,913
- Ah, order now not one but
two teenage dope dealers.

350
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,573
Our late night special.

351
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,374
- But there's only
supposed to be one of them.

352
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,739
- Two possible is heading for his car,

353
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,740
you got him?

354
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,653
- We got him?

355
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,630
- Let's go.

356
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,090
Hi there.

357
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,940
- Hi.

358
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,729
- I thought I was dealing
with a guy named Roger?

359
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,639
- You're dealing with
him, he's right there.

360
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,829
- Oh yeah?

361
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,009
Hi roger, where's my stuff?

362
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,993
- Hey, it's in a good place, man.

363
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:49,788
- What do you mean?

364
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:50,899
I'm here you're here, Roger's here.

365
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,512
How's the surf, man?

366
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:53,663
- Too many people, man.

367
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:57,189
What do we need so many people for?

368
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,495
- I like people.

369
00:16:58,496 --> 00:17:00,777
I'm in the people's business.

370
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:03,592
- [man] No good man let's
go for (indistinct).

371
00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:05,360
- Keep it Tommy, keep it here.

372
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:08,809
- [Tommy] Listen man, I
got a whole lot of people

373
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,319
up in Hollywood waiting for this too,

374
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,173
now if you can't help me, you
know I'll go somewhere else.

375
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,913
- Hey, hang lose friend.

376
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,613
Lose, right here.

377
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:21,519
Soon as my man gets here.

378
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,849
- You're a man?

379
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,750
All I see here is a couple of
kids trying to sell me dope.

380
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,213
Is that your guy?

381
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,003
- Nope, got nothing to do with us, man.

382
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,529
- [Tommy] I came down
here because you said

383
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,980
you can do four ounces now
I wasted my time or what?

384
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:40,981
How about him?

385
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:45,289
(car engine revs)

386
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,039
- Hey I told you man they're here.

387
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,290
- [Tommy] Go talk to him.

388
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:53,389
- All right listen up folks,

389
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,099
we've got a wagon parked
at the side of the store

390
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,933
nobody's getting out,

391
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:57,389
we may have us a couple more players,

392
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,540
so keep your eyes open.

393
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,971
- Look at the Honda we got the wagon.

394
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:03,472
This is supposed to be simple.

395
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:08,495
(speaks foreign language)

396
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,629
- Okay which one of
you dudes do I talk to?

397
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,183
- Hey, take it easy my friend.

398
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,639
- We're gonna do something or what?

399
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Yes or no?

400
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:20,346
- You got the money?

401
00:18:20,347 --> 00:18:21,897
- I didn't come here for a tan.

402
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:39,639
- Okay, five minutes.

403
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,809
Go wait over there.

404
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,810
- Where?

405
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,490
- In the light.

406
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,730
So we can see you're not
pulling any funny stuff.

407
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,923
Roger wait's with you.

408
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,009
- Okay Roger, I'm gonna call my lady,

409
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,760
you go stand over there, huh?

410
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,704
- That surf mobile's not moving.

411
00:19:10,705 --> 00:19:11,952
I think they're in on this.

412
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:13,919
- Okay people, it's going down.

413
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,753
In case you didn't hear that,

414
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,096
they say they'd be back
in about five minutes.

415
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:20,249
- And when it goes down, you
make sure Tommy's covered.

416
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,119
If the others split, let him go, copy?

417
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,289
- We take the ones with Tommy.

418
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,593
- That's top priority.

419
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,673
The others only if he's secure.

420
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,349
- Hello sweetheart,
your lover boy calling.

421
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,149
- In your dreams Quinn.

422
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,469
- Oh Bernice you're breaking my heart.

423
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,669
- [Bernice] Where are you?

424
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,609
- [Tommy] I'm in San
Pedro finishing up a deal,

425
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,610
any messages?

426
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,259
- [Bernice] Not a thing honey.

427
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,729
I'm afraid nobody loves you anymore.

428
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,809
- [Tommy] Denial, that is denial Bernice.

429
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,283
You know you love me.

430
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:55,215
(car engine revving)

431
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:05,649
- These guys ain't coming through,

432
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,953
maybe we ought to just
call the whole thing off.

433
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,443
- They're back.

434
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:22,425
The Honda's back, you see them?

435
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:23,259
- We got it.

436
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,259
(suspenseful music)

437
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,900
- Well, you should see the
look on his brother's face.

438
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:41,980
(suspenseful music)

439
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:44,963
(speaks in foreign language)

440
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:47,964
(suspenseful music)

441
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:49,951
- Okay.

442
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:54,287
(suspenseful music)

443
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:08,530
- Yeah. Bernice I gotta go earn my living.

444
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:12,257
(Tommy laughs) Yeah.

445
00:21:12,258 --> 00:21:14,456
(gun shot)
(Tommy wails)

446
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:15,290
- No, gun-

447
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,074
(glass shutters)

448
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,329
(suspenseful music)

449
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,436
(glass shutters)

450
00:21:19,437 --> 00:21:22,437
(suspenseful music)

451
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,415
- Freeze!

452
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,411
(suspenseful music)

453
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:36,244
Don't do it man.

454
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:38,494
(gun shot)

455
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:41,312
- [Woman] What is he doing?

456
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:44,892
(suspenseful music)

457
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:47,143
(gun shot)

458
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,168
(wails in foreign language)

459
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:57,169
(suspenseful music)

460
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:11,103
(gun shot)

461
00:22:15,513 --> 00:22:18,623
(tire screeching)

462
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,957
(gun shots)

463
00:22:24,991 --> 00:22:25,991
- Get down.

464
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,603
(tire screeching)

465
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,741
- Get Tommy, right over there.

466
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:52,423
- Call it in.

467
00:22:52,424 --> 00:22:53,829
Get help.

468
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,163
Secure the area.

469
00:22:56,302 --> 00:22:57,635
What the, Julie.

470
00:22:58,646 --> 00:23:01,331
(suspenseful music)

471
00:23:01,332 --> 00:23:02,655
It's all right Tommy.

472
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,156
It's gonna be all right Tommy.

473
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,678
It's gonna be all right.

474
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,171
(suspenseful music)

475
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:14,172
Okay?

476
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:18,086
(siren wails)

477
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:22,988
(engine roars)

478
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:28,917
(indistinct chattering)

479
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:42,748
- We'll take this guys.

480
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:43,889
- No way, you don't touch him,

481
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,248
until I say you should touch him, hear me?

482
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:47,075
- It's okay.

483
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:47,909
- Ray this guys have been shot

484
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,342
and maybe we shouldn't move them.

485
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:50,456
- Just get 'em off of here.

486
00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:51,839
Get 'em outta here.

487
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,569
(speaks in foreign language)

488
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,720
- Paramedic, over here.

489
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:05,895
- Tommy?

490
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:08,663
- Matt don't.

491
00:24:10,105 --> 00:24:13,355
(police radio chatter)

492
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:24,542
(distant siren wails)

493
00:24:43,998 --> 00:24:45,869
- All I heard was, shoot;

494
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,063
Loud just like Vietnam, shotgun-

495
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,559
- Find the narks who are here

496
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,579
keep them away from each other.

497
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,729
Now who's running this show?

498
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,633
- Lieutenant Wiltern sir,

499
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:55,009
he's over by the phone booth.

500
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,679
- Right. check out that mess over there.

501
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,313
- Yes sir.

502
00:24:58,314 --> 00:25:00,269
- Potato chips.

503
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,439
- I'm gonna have to break this up.

504
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,559
- This is my partner.

505
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,749
- Internal Affairs is
gonna want to talk to you.

506
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,289
They don't want you getting
your stories together.

507
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,353
- Our stories?

508
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,330
- It's what I'm told.

509
00:25:12,535 --> 00:25:15,118
(Julie scoffs)

510
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,549
- Somebody's a hell of a shot.

511
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,550
Check him for ID.

512
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:32,682
- Wiltern, Matmuso.

513
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:35,348
What the hell happened here?

514
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:36,439
- At least three of them got away.

515
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,919
We sent descriptions out over the air.

516
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,509
- Oh we got people looking for them.

517
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,249
Maybe the two we sent to the
hospital got us what we want.

518
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,039
- I'd like to talk to my squad.

519
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,873
- Excuse me sir.

520
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:44,862
- Yeah.

521
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:46,109
- We have a male Asian in the car;

522
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,943
He's dead.

523
00:25:46,943 --> 00:25:47,943
- I shot him.

524
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:51,439
- In that case, I'm gonna have
to ask you for your weapon

525
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,740
then read you your rights.

526
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,509
- I know my rights.

527
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,149
I'd like to talk to my people.

528
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,319
- Not until Internal Affairs
is finished with them.

529
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,029
We've got a dead civilian on the scene

530
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,899
and we've got to find out what happened.

531
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,699
- I told you, I shot him.

532
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,429
- Ray, I don't hear another word from you

533
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,039
until I've given you your rights.

534
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,053
- I don't give a damn about rights.

535
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,079
Your responsible for this investigation,

536
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,699
well I'm still responsible
for holding together

537
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,333
what's left of my squad.

538
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,473
Now unless you stop me,
I'm going to talk to them.

539
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:30,189
(police radio chatter)

540
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,033
- I'm sorry sir.

541
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:33,960
- It's all right I'm
his commanding officer.

542
00:26:33,961 --> 00:26:35,716
Art listen to me, you know these II guys

543
00:26:35,717 --> 00:26:37,019
are going to question you.

544
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,769
- I'll just tell them what I saw.

545
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,889
- If you want to talk to them that's okay,

546
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,989
if you don't want to talk to them,

547
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,119
you tell them that or you tell me.

548
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,709
- I don't know how many shots I heard.

549
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,849
By the time Matt and I made it over here

550
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,669
all hell had broken lose.

551
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,939
- Well how many times
did you fire your weapon.

552
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,569
- There was a truck in the way,

553
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,093
I never even got a shot off.

554
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,359
- The suspect came from the Honda

555
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,689
which was parked over there,

556
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,979
and proceeded to retrieve a shotgun

557
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,719
from behind the center vending machine.

558
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,499
Officer Quinn was waiting
in the phone booth,

559
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,459
the suspect opened fire;

560
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,869
After the first shot officer
Regan and I were on the way.

561
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,129
I continued toward the
subject and shouted a warning.

562
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,979
- [Matmuso] Did you identify
yourself as a police officer?

563
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,980
- Yes I did.

564
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,691
- Okay Ray, this car
will take you Downtown.

565
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:24,692
(suspenseful music)

566
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,570
- These guys are supposed
to be such hot shots,

567
00:27:48,653 --> 00:27:50,213
they sure screwed this one up.

568
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:55,622
(suspenseful music)

569
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,910
(phone rings)

570
00:28:06,837 --> 00:28:09,837
(suspenseful music)

571
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:25,479
- And how many suspects
were there, all together?

572
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,299
- There were at least six.

573
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,959
- Is that what you expected?

574
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,479
- Sure wasn't.

575
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,863
- Well then, why'd you go
forward with the operation?

576
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,303
- That wasn't my call.

577
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,299
- But you felt the
situation was under control?

578
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,163
- That wasn't my call.

579
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:44,870
- And when did you first become aware

580
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:46,749
of the suspect's intentions?

581
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,000
- When I saw the shotgun.

582
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,839
- But you're telling me
that prior to that time

583
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,309
you had no indication?

584
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,129
- What indication?

585
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,029
Tommy was by the phone
and anyone could see

586
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,269
the kid wasn't armed.

587
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,120
Then all of a sudden, he's got a gun.

588
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,279
Tommy didn't have a chance.

589
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,532
- Any chance they knew he was a cop?

590
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:10,845
- No, no way they didn't make him.

591
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:12,126
- [Interviewer] How do you know?

592
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,669
- I know, because Tommy was the best nark

593
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,439
that I ever worked with
and those those piss ants

594
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,829
didn't have a clue.

595
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,830
- What'd you do when the shooting began?

596
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,750
- I couldn't get across the street.

597
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,330
- [Interviewer] What do you mean?

598
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:34,357
- They're killing my partner

599
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:36,199
and I couldn't get across the street

600
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,200
because there's a truck.

601
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,629
- Before that, how'd you
feel about this whole thing

602
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,030
before the shooting started?

603
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,813
- Not good, yeah.

604
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,809
- What really happened out there Matt?

605
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,810
Who screwed this up?

606
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,037
Tommy being a cowboy?

607
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:03,538
(Matt laughs)

608
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,714
- You're enjoying yourself aren't you?

609
00:30:06,715 --> 00:30:07,548
Huh?

610
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:08,779
- Hey pal, they got me
out of bed for this,

611
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,613
you know the drill.

612
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:10,446
- Yeah I know the drill.

613
00:30:10,447 --> 00:30:12,839
I think the drill stinks.

614
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,659
Tommy Quinn was my friend and he's dead

615
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,979
and I should be with his family

616
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,099
instead of screwing around here with you,

617
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,649
with some stinking drill.

618
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,659
- His family's been notified.

619
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,863
- Ah, yeah notified.

620
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,730
I need some air.

621
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,689
- That's when I turned and fired.

622
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,319
- Across the lot at the gray Honda?

623
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
- That's correct.

624
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,349
- Who was in the vehicle?

625
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,270
- I don't know.

626
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,210
- You fired at the vehicle,

627
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,829
but didn't know who was in it?

628
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,049
- They were firing at me.

629
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,809
- You mean from that general direction?

630
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,489
- There was no one else there.

631
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,229
- Look, Ray we're trying
to assess the need

632
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,423
for deadly force.

633
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,636
- One of my guys is dead

634
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:52,103
and I got a parking lot full of bad guys.

635
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,307
There's your need.

636
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:58,117
- Are you aware the man you
killed didn't have a weapon?

637
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,140
- No.

638
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,869
The other guy in the car took off,

639
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,070
he must have grabbed it.

640
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,570
- Maybe.

641
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:16,108
(bell rings)

642
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:27,766
(suspenseful music)

643
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:30,969
(Matt sobbing)

644
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,970
- You okay?

645
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,559
- Yeah questions, you
know this damn question.

646
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,806
- Just to hang in there
a little while longer

647
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:38,300
and we can all go home.

648
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,033
- Take your hand off me.

649
00:31:44,338 --> 00:31:47,338
(suspenseful music)

650
00:32:07,855 --> 00:32:10,605
(water swashing)

651
00:32:26,786 --> 00:32:29,953
(somber upbeat music)

652
00:33:13,778 --> 00:33:16,195
(Art grunts)

653
00:33:21,548 --> 00:33:24,215
(Julie sobbing)

654
00:33:27,018 --> 00:33:30,185
(somber upbeat music)

655
00:33:38,498 --> 00:33:40,831
(dog barks)

656
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:52,573
- Hi.

657
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,121
You okay?

658
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:58,622
- Yeah come on in.

659
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,589
- I heard the news, I've
been trying to call you.

660
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,759
- You know I have my phone unplugged.

661
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,325
Do you want some weak
coffee, I ran out of milk?

662
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:08,589
- No, I can't stay.

663
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,983
I'm showing a house over on Valley Vista.

664
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,889
Well I could come back if you want.

665
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,129
- That's okay.

666
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,259
I have to see Carol Quinn

667
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,283
and take care of a few things for Tommy.

668
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:23,193
- Will you tell her how sorry I am.

669
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,943
God what is she gonna do?

670
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,513
Those two little boys.

671
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,620
- How's your business?

672
00:34:37,622 --> 00:34:41,033
- Well, the market's soft
but my office is doing great.

673
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,493
You look tired Ray.

674
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,800
- I killed one of them.

675
00:34:56,665 --> 00:34:59,796
- The newspaper said he was unarmed.

676
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:00,797
- I don't know.

677
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,519
Maybe.

678
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,959
- You want to talk about this?

679
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
- Nope.

680
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,229
- Ray, I know you've read all the books

681
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,209
and you think you know what to expect

682
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:22,973
but if this gets too tough, call me.

683
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:27,999
- I don't think he suffered much.

684
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,413
It all happened so fast.

685
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,160
- How are the others doing?

686
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:35,930
- They'll handle it.

687
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,313
I mean, Julie's got...

688
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:41,003
And Art he's been through
so much in his life.

689
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,030
- What about Matt?

690
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,070
- There's nobody closer to Tommy.

691
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,843
But I can't get into his head.

692
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:00,813
- Ray, are you sure you're all right?

693
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,270
- Terrific.

694
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,903
You know anybody who wants to buy a boat?

695
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,429
- I'll come back when I'm finished.

696
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,513
- No, it's okay.

697
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,810
I won't be here.

698
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,861
(car engine roars)

699
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,970
(tires screeching)

700
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:48,685
(distant siren wailing)

701
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,829
Dolores, Hi.

702
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,830
- Hi.

703
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:29,243
I saw on the TV about Tommy,

704
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:32,269
what happened to him.

705
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,529
He was a nice guy.

706
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,363
- Yeah he was a nice guy.

707
00:37:35,364 --> 00:37:37,127
Listen, Dolores you left me a message.

708
00:37:37,128 --> 00:37:38,678
- I just wanted to talk to you.

709
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,978
- About Tommy?

710
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:44,510
- Yeah.

711
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:45,511
- Thank you.

712
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,333
- Tommy and me, we were friends.

713
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:56,614
He told me to go back home,

714
00:37:57,739 --> 00:37:58,993
go back to school.

715
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,820
- Why didn't you listen to him?

716
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,090
- Got no place to go back to.

717
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,700
I got some friends to meet.

718
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:15,709
Look I hate to ask, but
Tommy, he owed me some money

719
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,959
for the thing with Mario.

720
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,950
- How much?

721
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:19,557
- 100, he promised me 100.

722
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:26,859
- Okay.

723
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,877
Look here's 200.

724
00:38:31,497 --> 00:38:33,169
And Mario was a big deal to us.

725
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,170
And Tommy would have wanted it that way.

726
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:37,595
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

727
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,899
- If Mario ever finds out
that I snitched him off,

728
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,751
I'm in a lot of trouble, you know?

729
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:44,403
- He won't find out, he's in jail.

730
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,677
- Listen, if you ever get anything else,

731
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,240
I mean, anything you
would have given Tommy

732
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,223
get in touch with me, okay?

733
00:39:00,224 --> 00:39:01,513
- Yeah, sure.

734
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:09,283
And you said you shot a guy, dead.

735
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:12,221
- Yeah I shot a guy.

736
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,753
- How many guys you killed
since you've been a cop?

737
00:39:19,044 --> 00:39:20,197
- That was the first.

738
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,400
- Does this mean you're not gonna bust me?

739
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,963
- I'm not in vice anymore.

740
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,270
- Hey, I'm really sorry about your friend.

741
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:06,391
(somber upbeat music)

742
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:28,252
(paper screeching)

743
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:31,420
(somber upbeat music)

744
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,570
- Thanks.

745
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,170
- Ray.
- Mm-hmm.

746
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,662
- Talk with you a minute?

747
00:40:50,663 --> 00:40:52,289
- If you don't mind watching me eat.

748
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,049
- I just left the hospital,

749
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,650
looks like you're gonna be okay.

750
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
- I'm gonna be okay?

751
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,539
- The man you killed, unarmed?

752
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,460
- [Ray] Yeah.

753
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:02,759
- Well one of the suspects you took down,

754
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,199
we questioned at the hospital.

755
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,033
- I know that.

756
00:41:05,034 --> 00:41:06,149
- He confirms your story.

757
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,069
The man you killed had a gun.

758
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:11,059
One of the other perps
probably ran off with it.

759
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,893
I just thought it'd be nice

760
00:41:11,894 --> 00:41:13,820
to give you some good news for a change.

761
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,200
- That's the good news?

762
00:41:20,537 --> 00:41:21,537
I'm gonna be okay.

763
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,679
Department suddenly believes me

764
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,683
because this scum says the same thing.

765
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,473
Excuse me, I've got a funeral to go.

766
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,150
- You're welcome.

767
00:41:41,754 --> 00:41:45,549
(somber upbeat music)

768
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,569
- How's Carol?

769
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,779
- She's holding on.

770
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,685
- Hey Donald.

771
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:49,518
- How you doing?

772
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,728
- You okay Julie?

773
00:41:50,729 --> 00:41:52,293
- I'm okay thanks.

774
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,599
- [Art] We'd better go inside.

775
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
- Yeah.

776
00:41:56,692 --> 00:41:59,859
(somber upbeat music)

777
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,810
- I don't think I can go in there.

778
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,893
- I'll be all right, come on.

779
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,910
- I can't go in there and
fall apart in front of Carol.

780
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,809
(somber upbeat music)

781
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,523
I just can't get it under control.

782
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:26,200
I'm so embarrassed.

783
00:42:26,201 --> 00:42:28,063
- It's okay Julie, whatever you feel,

784
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,900
Tommy would understand.

785
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,756
- I'm sorry.

786
00:42:34,757 --> 00:42:37,924
(somber upbeat music)

787
00:42:48,224 --> 00:42:49,224
- Hi.

788
00:42:58,597 --> 00:43:00,154
- How you holding Carol?

789
00:43:00,155 --> 00:43:01,238
Are you okay?

790
00:43:02,645 --> 00:43:03,645
- I'm fine.

791
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,875
- Michael you doing okay?

792
00:43:08,876 --> 00:43:10,526
- I'm okay.

793
00:43:10,527 --> 00:43:13,694
(somber upbeat music)

794
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:22,378
- Pat, how you doing?

795
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,260
- How come you didn't kill

796
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:25,793
the people that shot my dad?

797
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,577
- Hey, my man.

798
00:43:29,578 --> 00:43:32,050
Art, my man look at her Mr. Natty.

799
00:43:32,051 --> 00:43:33,345
- No, hey.

800
00:43:33,346 --> 00:43:34,656
- Oh, you're looking sharp today.

801
00:43:34,657 --> 00:43:36,693
- [Art] That's not good Matt.

802
00:43:36,694 --> 00:43:37,969
Hey Matt-

803
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:39,979
- [Matt] Yeah, you clean up real good.

804
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,099
- [Art] Come on, I'll
buy you a cup of coffee.

805
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,699
- No, coffee's bad for my nerve man.

806
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,149
No, you wouldn't want me
to have a shaky trigger

807
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,300
freaking out would you?

808
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:49,337
- [Ray] I'm sorry.

809
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:51,569
- LT, the best damn squad there ever was.

810
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,029
Yes sir, set every record there is,

811
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,270
all for one, one for all, et cetera.

812
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:58,759
- Your outta line Matt.

813
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,143
- Hey, ladies look at this man right here.

814
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,399
Best damn lieutenant ever.

815
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,250
Knows how to take care of his people;

816
00:44:08,287 --> 00:44:09,287
A good man.

817
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,069
Hey where's the music?

818
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,223
Some real music.

819
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,380
Tommy would like some music right, huh?

820
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:20,159
Or some Buddy Holly or Roy
Orbison or something like that.

821
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,449
Pump up the music, break it up;

822
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,230
It's funny man, you don't know like.

823
00:44:25,231 --> 00:44:26,652
What are you doing?

824
00:44:26,653 --> 00:44:29,459
I don't want to take it
easy, he's my partner.

825
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,519
He's my partner man.

826
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,879
- Come on.
- We know that.

827
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,989
- I wanna pay my respects,

828
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,719
Tommy would have wanted
me to pay my respects.

829
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,639
- Hey, what you need to do is go home.

830
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,329
If you don't pull it together real fast,

831
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,430
I'm gonna kick your ass all the way there.

832
00:44:46,457 --> 00:44:50,040
- Well you take me, I
ain't going with him.

833
00:44:53,049 --> 00:44:54,049
- Oh man.

834
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,329
- Lieutenant, your office
has been trying to reach you.

835
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,989
The judge is releasing
Mario Portillo Grande.

836
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,289
- What?

837
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,449
- He's Attorney, Varjak,
he's got him to set bail.

838
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,489
- Bail him and he'll skip.

839
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,229
- Judge said if he had
Tommy to put on a stand

840
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,180
he could convict,

841
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:13,590
but without his testimony

842
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,070
those drugs could belong
to anybody in the house.

843
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:22,588
(phone ringing)

844
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,410
(police radio chatter)

845
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,129
- Hey.

846
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,703
- Bring my car around cop?

847
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,199
'Cause I got a lot of
appointments on the outside.

848
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,849
- You may walk today Mario
but you're still going down.

849
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,599
- I ain't going nowhere but out of here.

850
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,819
And I would have sued you and
the City for wrongful arrest,

851
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,079
'cause what you think you got for a case

852
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,830
that has got nothing to do with me.

853
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,969
- My man made you on six other buys.

854
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:55,940
- You're man?

855
00:45:55,941 --> 00:45:57,563
You mean the narc who got iced?

856
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,699
May he rest in peace,

857
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,229
but without him you ain't got a prayer.

858
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,914
No way, Jose, oh no way Ray.

859
00:46:06,915 --> 00:46:08,667
It's all down the toilet now,

860
00:46:09,646 --> 00:46:10,646
and you know it.

861
00:46:12,332 --> 00:46:14,138
(speaks foreign language)

862
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:16,639
(phone rings)

863
00:46:25,305 --> 00:46:28,222
(car engine roars)

864
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,310
- Hey.
- Hi.

865
00:46:49,285 --> 00:46:50,869
- You ready for work?

866
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,709
- Are there any choices?

867
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,887
- I got two weeks, went by
like two hours didn't it?

868
00:46:55,888 --> 00:46:57,919
- I'm just telling myself
it's like any other day

869
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,311
but i keep thinking that-

870
00:47:00,312 --> 00:47:03,664
- Julie, you got to do what I do,

871
00:47:03,665 --> 00:47:05,449
just don't think about it.

872
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,323
- Hey what do i tell my people.

873
00:47:10,336 --> 00:47:12,619
Yeah, you say you can do business,

874
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,320
so why don't we do something, hmm?

875
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,548
Okay, you got two hours Chi Chi,

876
00:47:17,549 --> 00:47:20,059
and if you don't have the stuff

877
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,410
then there's those that do.

878
00:47:24,766 --> 00:47:26,689
(Matt laughs)

879
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,279
- Do my ears deceive me or
is Matthew setting up a buy?

880
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,259
- Shaking and baking
Art, shaking and baking.

881
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,569
Morning Jules.

882
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:35,759
- Morning Matt.

883
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,159
- Which one is this, Jamaican?

884
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,869
- But of course man,

885
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,669
he got the body shop where he's moving

886
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,822
more to new fenders man,

887
00:47:42,823 --> 00:47:47,823
and I ain't stopping until I
get this guy's fanny in a vice.

888
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,780
- Well get him Matt, we all...

889
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,160
What are you doing?

890
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,960
- What?

891
00:48:03,966 --> 00:48:05,416
- Well this is Tommy's stuff;

892
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,619
That's his cap, that's
his mug for God's sake.

893
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,339
- Hey Jules, why don't you just stand

894
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,253
your own side of the yard, okay?

895
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,359
- What are you doing to yourself?

896
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,049
- Back off!

897
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,929
- Take it easy buddy, she's only trying-

898
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:23,080
- Hey I don't care what
she's trying to do,

899
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:25,810
I don't care.

900
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,923
- We all loved him Matt,

901
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,469
but you can't turn your
life into a shrine.

902
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,968
- Hey, I ain't turned in my life...

903
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:51,335
Don't you touch my desk, you understand?

904
00:48:51,336 --> 00:48:52,836
- I said, Matthew.

905
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:56,642
- What's going on here?

906
00:48:56,643 --> 00:48:57,909
- It's nothing.

907
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,663
Matt's just telling us
about a buy we can make.

908
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,120
- Oh yeah?

909
00:49:05,121 --> 00:49:07,039
- Yeah, Matt says this guy can do a kilo,

910
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,503
and Art and I don't think we
ought to push him that hard.

911
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,370
- All right.

912
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,510
Why don't you set it up Matt.

913
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,989
Only go slow.

914
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,889
- Yeah, I scope him, man.

915
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,432
Real easy wheeling deal.

916
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:24,933
(Matt laughs)

917
00:49:31,018 --> 00:49:33,601
(Julie scoffs)

918
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:41,091
(upbeat music)

919
00:50:05,222 --> 00:50:08,971
- Why are you riding
that awful hog for, man?

920
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,216
At right price, I put you in something

921
00:50:10,217 --> 00:50:13,219
where you don't have to scrape
the bugs off of your teeth.

922
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,509
- You know everybody is anybody
who's into bikes these days.

923
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,349
- Oh no, not me in this city,

924
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:21,429
I like plenty a locker and chrome run me

925
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:24,339
and a CD player, pumping the latest jams

926
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,989
when I'm cruising the Boulevard.

927
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:28,409
- Great, so what do you got for me?

928
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:31,809
- I got some special
wheels here, just for you.

929
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:33,943
That'll put style into your life.

930
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:37,379
My car, the red car, man.

931
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,069
Red means faster.

932
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:42,209
Got a sweet fast speed transmission

933
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,469
flash that'll blow you away.

934
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:47,146
- Yeah well, flash ain't what I'm here

935
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:49,007
to talk about Chi Chi.

936
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,759
- Yeah?

937
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,889
So what you want to talk about big guy?

938
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,476
- What we talked about on the phone, man.

939
00:50:56,477 --> 00:50:58,723
- Chi Chi talks a lot on the phone, man.

940
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,193
To a lot of people but a lot of teams.

941
00:51:05,277 --> 00:51:08,649
But I get amnesia sometimes.

942
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,223
- Well you know I got pressure.

943
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:14,180
- You got pressure, see a doctor, man.

944
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,777
That's some tight stuff,

945
00:51:19,778 --> 00:51:23,073
where you find something like
that with your ugly face?

946
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:27,639
- Look man, I got people
waiting and I'm gonna deliver.

947
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,523
Now, are you gonna yank my chain here

948
00:51:29,524 --> 00:51:31,389
or do we have a deal?

949
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:34,259
- It's a waiting business, man.

950
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,229
We all got to wait.

951
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,230
- Not me.

952
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,629
- Not you?

953
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:42,909
Who the hell are you?

954
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:46,303
- Cut the crap okay Chi
Chi, I ain't got the time.

955
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,319
Now are you gonna be as good
as that line of telephone bowl,

956
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,613
or do I blow out of here?

957
00:51:55,387 --> 00:51:58,054
(Chi Chi laughs)

958
00:51:59,723 --> 00:52:03,556
- You got a mouth on you
man, and an attitude.

959
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,030
- Yeah.

960
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,320
- Matt.

961
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:19,918
(key screeching)

962
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,300
- And I'll be in touch.

963
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,913
And next time, you
deliver what you promise.

964
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:46,950
Come on baby, this man got
to get his stuff together.

965
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:53,021
(engine revving)

966
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,039
- Are you crazy?

967
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,950
What the hell are you
trying to do back there?

968
00:53:08,951 --> 00:53:11,929
- Hey did you see the
look in that guy's face?

969
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,423
In another minute, I had him crying.

970
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:18,181
(Matt laughs)

971
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,017
- Ray, hey.

972
00:53:21,018 --> 00:53:22,609
- Simon, what's up?

973
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,779
- I'm handling prosecution
of the Tommy Quinn case.

974
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,889
- Good great, can't wait to
drop the pill on those bastards.

975
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:31,609
- Well, that's why I'm here
in a manner of speaking,

976
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,483
the defendant young Mr.
Tron he wants to cooperate.

977
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,533
- What do you mean?

978
00:53:38,533 --> 00:53:39,366
Plead bargain?
- Yeah.

979
00:53:39,367 --> 00:53:41,523
- No way, not on this one, no bargains.

980
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,319
- The boy's 19, he's a
Vietnamese immigrant,

981
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,829
he has no priors and he contends
he was being threatened.

982
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:48,663
- By who?

983
00:53:48,663 --> 00:53:49,590
- By the people he worked for.

984
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:50,440
He said they would have killed him

985
00:53:50,441 --> 00:53:52,249
if he didn't go through with it.

986
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,759
- Simon, I'm telling you
that kid was like ice,

987
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,510
he didn't give it a second thought.

988
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,359
No cutting corners.

989
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,999
- I understand how you feel Ray,

990
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,229
but every time you go to
trial, there's a risk.

991
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:04,569
There's a chance you'll come up empty.

992
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:07,369
He's a young kid, and the defense

993
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:10,170
is claiming that your people
pulled their weapons first.

994
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:14,980
Just think about it.

995
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,720
- Hey Dolores, I've been looking for you.

996
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:31,809
I need your help.

997
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,643
- With what?

998
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,816
- Mario.

999
00:54:33,817 --> 00:54:35,008
- No, I can't do that.

1000
00:54:35,009 --> 00:54:35,842
- Yes you can.

1001
00:54:35,843 --> 00:54:36,919
- No, you told me he
wasn't going to get out,

1002
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,753
that's what you said.

1003
00:54:37,754 --> 00:54:39,263
- You help and this
time I'll make it stick.

1004
00:54:39,264 --> 00:54:40,569
- No, uh-uh, I'm not
going to do this anymore.

1005
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:43,219
- How old are you Dolores?

1006
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,499
- Almost 17.

1007
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,889
- Ever been to Juvie Hall?

1008
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:46,723
- No.

1009
00:54:46,724 --> 00:54:48,844
- Well that's where you're
going if you don't help me.

1010
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:53,169
Information on Mario is all I want.

1011
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,899
Totally confidential,

1012
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,350
phone numbers where I
could be reached all hours.

1013
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,079
You deliver him to me Dolores,

1014
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,083
and it's worth a lot more than $200.

1015
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,120
A lot more.

1016
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,599
- He asked me what I was worried about.

1017
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,099
He said it was all an act
just to keep him off balance.

1018
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:17,933
- Was it?

1019
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:18,766
- I don't think so.

1020
00:55:18,767 --> 00:55:21,068
- He's out of control Ray.

1021
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:22,519
- Okay.

1022
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,529
Look, he's having a hard time.

1023
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,039
- No, you're not listening,

1024
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,793
Matt is dangerous.

1025
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,869
- I don't know,

1026
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,719
maybe he shouldn't be working undercover.

1027
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,809
- What are you talking about?

1028
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,309
- Not yet anyway.

1029
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:35,200
- Julie?

1030
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:36,569
- Maybe none of us should.

1031
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:39,609
- Come on, this is what we do.

1032
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,129
This is no time to quit.

1033
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,599
- We're not talking about quitting,

1034
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,439
we're talking about Matthew.

1035
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,979
- He wants to get these guys so bad,

1036
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,913
he doesn't even care
what happens to himself.

1037
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:55,783
- We do the deal together.

1038
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:00,583
I'll send Art in with him
and you'll team with me.

1039
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,180
- All right.

1040
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,753
- Come on I'll buy you guys
a couple of burgers, huh?

1041
00:56:07,754 --> 00:56:09,743
- No, I'm gonna head on home.

1042
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:11,970
- Me too.

1043
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,100
Bye.

1044
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,040
- Hi.
- Hey.

1045
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,729
- Oh, I've been thinking about you.

1046
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:50,099
- Well, I saw the lights on I thought

1047
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,469
who else would be working late with you.

1048
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,669
- Should I search for a
compliment in there somewhere?

1049
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:56,979
- Sure, come on, after
13 years of marriage

1050
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,409
with all that pent-up energy
ready to unleash on the world

1051
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:02,139
who's going to keep you
from being number one huh?

1052
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,140
- Thanks.

1053
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:05,653
Maybe I could find us
something to drink in the back?

1054
00:57:05,654 --> 00:57:07,109
- No that's okay.

1055
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:09,553
- I was just wondering if
you were free for dinner.

1056
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,577
- I'm not.

1057
00:57:13,578 --> 00:57:14,619
- Huh?

1058
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,929
- He's picking me up in 20 minutes.

1059
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:18,030
I was just doing some paperwork till then.

1060
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,399
Listen, the dinner is
business, I could cancel.

1061
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,843
- No, it's okay you go on.

1062
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:34,732
- What is it?

1063
00:57:34,733 --> 00:57:35,733
- Hmm?

1064
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:38,870
I don't know Barb.

1065
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:45,083
Julie and Art think
Matt Fisher's dangerous.

1066
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:47,599
- Is he?

1067
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,379
- I don't know, maybe.

1068
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,605
I don't know anything anymore.

1069
00:57:51,606 --> 00:57:53,403
Everything seems to be dangerous.

1070
00:57:55,566 --> 00:57:58,249
- I know how hard it is trying
to hold everything together.

1071
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,083
- Do you?

1072
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:00,083
How do you know that?

1073
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,769
- You're right, I don't know.

1074
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:10,479
I try to imagine, I try to
feel what you must be feeling

1075
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,480
but I can't.

1076
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,659
You know when we were first married,

1077
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,659
we used to talk all the time.

1078
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,959
We used to talk about how you felt,

1079
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,909
we used to talk about what
was happening on the job,

1080
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:29,619
about how you felt about what
was happening on the job.

1081
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:31,539
- All right you want to know
what's happening on the job?

1082
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,909
Julie's held together with glue,

1083
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:36,149
Matt's not held together
at all, Art who knows.

1084
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,219
I don't want to push Julie,

1085
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:40,529
I don't want to chop Matt's
legs out from under him, okay?

1086
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:41,859
Now we've talked.

1087
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,419
That's the whole problem.

1088
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,729
- That's not the whole problem Ray.

1089
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,599
You're trying to do this
whole thing by yourself.

1090
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,593
You just can't do it that way.

1091
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,150
Well I'm not the only one
you're not in touch with.

1092
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:57,787
- What do you mean, Matt?

1093
00:58:57,788 --> 00:58:59,483
- No, I mean you.

1094
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:04,009
I can't push her, I
don't want to upset him,

1095
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:07,409
it's all about everyone's
needs but your own.

1096
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,209
- I'm their commanding officer.

1097
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:11,019
- And Tommy Quinn was one of your men

1098
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:14,799
but he was also your friend,

1099
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,863
you lost your friend Ray,

1100
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,289
and it's okay for you to feel that loss.

1101
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,040
When are you gonna cry for him Ray?

1102
00:59:32,104 --> 00:59:34,019
You know the problem with cops?

1103
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,219
Whenever something goes wrong

1104
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,320
you think it's got to be somebody's fault.

1105
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:44,363
That's just not true,
some things just happen.

1106
00:59:53,336 --> 00:59:56,669
(footsteps approaching)

1107
01:00:10,468 --> 01:00:12,279
- [Julie] The one doing
the talking is Chi Chi,

1108
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,179
I don't know the other two.

1109
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,699
- Keep an eye on them.

1110
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,251
12-8 to 12-12, come in.

1111
01:00:18,252 --> 01:00:20,299
- This is 12-12 we're in position.

1112
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,479
- Do you have visual contact?

1113
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,099
- Well that's a negative lieutenant.

1114
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,679
If we come up any more they're
certain hell going to see us.

1115
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,680
- All right just keep this channel open.

1116
01:00:29,664 --> 01:00:34,664
- Hugh, so (speaks indistinctly)

1117
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,544
- That's them.

1118
01:00:39,545 --> 01:00:40,962
- Here they come.

1119
01:00:46,222 --> 01:00:47,972
- I cannot believe...

1120
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,017
(door slams)

1121
01:01:08,305 --> 01:01:10,149
- What the hell is this, man?

1122
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:11,939
- Business man, business.

1123
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,209
- Got the stuff?

1124
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:15,119
- You didn't tell me
you was bringing no one.

1125
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,249
- Hey man, it's my money.

1126
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,623
He just set this up for me.

1127
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,960
Hey look brother, I'm
ready, are you ready?

1128
01:01:24,242 --> 01:01:25,833
- [Chi Chi] I don't see no money here.

1129
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:29,339
- [Matt] This guy, man.

1130
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,099
Well somebody better
show somebody something.

1131
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,194
- The shop, there's
two more by the office.

1132
01:01:34,195 --> 01:01:35,028
- [Matt] you know what I'm saying?

1133
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:35,897
I tell you what?

1134
01:01:35,898 --> 01:01:40,116
You show me yours, I'll show you mine.

1135
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:42,617
- There's one more over there.

1136
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:49,122
- Relax man.

1137
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,090
- [Matt] I'm relaxed.

1138
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:51,343
- Stop being high.

1139
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:54,040
Let's see the color of your cash.

1140
01:01:55,093 --> 01:01:57,809
(Matt laughs)

1141
01:01:57,810 --> 01:01:59,223
- [Matt] This guy.

1142
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:01,389
- Come on.

1143
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,919
You have the money, shower to him.

1144
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,920
- [Art] Hey brother.

1145
01:02:10,323 --> 01:02:14,240
- Now we talking, come
on, your stuff's inside.

1146
01:02:15,405 --> 01:02:18,405
(suspenseful music)

1147
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,550
- It's a trap.

1148
01:03:10,551 --> 01:03:13,417
It's a trap, this is
12-8 to 12-12, hit 'em.

1149
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:16,579
- Are we on the same frequency lieutenant?

1150
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,709
You didn't give a signal.

1151
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,936
- Damn it, I said him now.

1152
01:03:19,937 --> 01:03:21,525
- let's do that guys.

1153
01:03:21,526 --> 01:03:23,972
(upbeat music)

1154
01:03:23,973 --> 01:03:26,890
(tires screeching)

1155
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,238
- Ah!

1156
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:44,822
(upbeat music)

1157
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:55,942
- Freeze!

1158
01:03:55,943 --> 01:03:56,901
Turn around.

1159
01:03:56,902 --> 01:03:58,669
Put your hands behind your back.

1160
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:00,350
(upbeat music)

1161
01:04:00,351 --> 01:04:02,112
(loud thud)

1162
01:04:02,113 --> 01:04:04,030
- [Julie] Hey, hold it!

1163
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:15,885
Don't move.

1164
01:04:20,955 --> 01:04:22,210
Jack!

1165
01:04:22,211 --> 01:04:23,211
Don't move.

1166
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:27,726
- Put your hands behind your head.

1167
01:04:27,727 --> 01:04:28,920
- What the hell is going on?

1168
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:29,921
You blew it.

1169
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:32,714
- Too many players Matt.

1170
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:33,548
- What are you talking about?

1171
01:04:33,549 --> 01:04:35,539
This is my case, it was under control.

1172
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,939
- You couldn't call it,
you couldn't see it.

1173
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,090
- It was under control!

1174
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:40,939
- Not from where I stood.

1175
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,359
- Well maybe you better
think about that lieutenant

1176
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,360
because if you're getting too
gun-shy for this line of work.

1177
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,640
- That's enough.

1178
01:04:52,592 --> 01:04:53,842
Now you can it.

1179
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:04,042
- What happened Ray?

1180
01:05:07,095 --> 01:05:08,159
- I don't know.

1181
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,160
- Bingo!

1182
01:05:10,315 --> 01:05:11,363
And I want a raise.

1183
01:05:12,297 --> 01:05:15,380
(car engine revving)

1184
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:25,359
- Hey man, I'm not gonna give you no ball,

1185
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,163
I've been done a few times already,

1186
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,279
I wanna work this one out.

1187
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,869
I can do good for you.

1188
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:33,020
I can bring you people.

1189
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,929
We'll be talking, man.

1190
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:39,463
I do you right, guaranteed.

1191
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,303
- What do you want to do with this guy?

1192
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,800
- It's okay.

1193
01:05:51,387 --> 01:05:53,720
We're letting Matt work him.

1194
01:05:54,588 --> 01:05:57,171
(upbeat music)

1195
01:06:18,093 --> 01:06:20,765
(pager beeps)

1196
01:06:20,766 --> 01:06:23,349
(upbeat music)

1197
01:06:56,259 --> 01:06:57,092
- Morning.

1198
01:06:57,092 --> 01:06:58,092
- Morning.

1199
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:04,159
- Now, the defense is going
to try to create confusion

1200
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,969
to cast doubt, to discredit your actions,

1201
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:11,259
including Tommy Quinn's at
the time of the shooting.

1202
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,449
I'm going to lead off with you two,

1203
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:14,523
to try to set up the operation.

1204
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,189
I want you to speak clearly,

1205
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:19,409
I want you to try to
remember every detail,

1206
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,689
everything that happened.

1207
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:23,053
Tell the truth, maintain your credibility.

1208
01:07:24,805 --> 01:07:28,059
I wish Matt was here, he's
the one who disarmed them.

1209
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:29,449
- He'll show.

1210
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,799
- Did you talk to him?

1211
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,679
- No, but he'll be here.

1212
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,593
- If he's not, he's in contempt.

1213
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,487
Now I want you...

1214
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,470
- They turned him into a choir boy.

1215
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:47,903
- It's about that time.

1216
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:56,463
- Hey man, you came hell in there.

1217
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,759
- Officer Regan, could you tell us

1218
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,669
how you were able to communicate

1219
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:11,119
with the other members of your squad.

1220
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,969
- We're in two-way radio communication

1221
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:15,299
with officers Tobias and Fisher.

1222
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,369
One-way communication with officer Quinn.

1223
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:19,679
- You could hear Tommy Quinn
but you couldn't talk to him?

1224
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,030
- Yeah, that's right he
was wearing a body mic.

1225
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,190
- And at what point
did you leave your car?

1226
01:08:27,241 --> 01:08:28,409
- When the suspect started shooting,

1227
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:31,163
we jumped out of our car and
headed for officer Quinn.

1228
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:39,970
- And did you see when officer
Tobias and officer Fisher

1229
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,709
got out of their car?

1230
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:44,619
- Not exactly, what I
saw was a large truck

1231
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,309
stopped in front of them.

1232
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:49,219
- But none, none of the police moved

1233
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:53,549
until the defendant started
shooting at officer Quinn?

1234
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:55,289
- That's correct.

1235
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:58,299
We were waiting for a
radio signal from Tommy.

1236
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,050
He wouldn't call us until
he'd actually seen the drugs.

1237
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,009
- Officer Tobias, how long have you been

1238
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,759
a narcotics officer?

1239
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,719
- About two and a half years.

1240
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,379
- And how long did you know Tommy Quinn?

1241
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,269
- Five years or so.

1242
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:14,219
- Now if I understand correctly,

1243
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,329
you were in a car parked
across the highway

1244
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:18,259
from the liquor store, is that correct?

1245
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,559
- That is correct.

1246
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,110
- And at what point did
officer Quinn draw his gun?

1247
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,563
- He never drew his gun.

1248
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,363
- Well, at what point did
officer Wiltern begin to fire?

1249
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:31,350
- I don't know.

1250
01:09:31,351 --> 01:09:33,053
My view was blocked by a truck.

1251
01:09:34,686 --> 01:09:35,686
- I see.

1252
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,559
Officer Quinn was
carrying a gun wasn't he?

1253
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,560
- Yes.

1254
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,481
- And you say you couldn't
see when officer Wiltern

1255
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:50,519
started to shoot, is that correct?

1256
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,869
- That's correct.

1257
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:54,269
- If you were across the highway

1258
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:57,179
and your view was blocked by a truck,

1259
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:00,199
how can you say for sure
that he didn't pull his gun?

1260
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,309
- Because he never saw the drugs,

1261
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:04,119
he wouldn't have drawn or given the signal

1262
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,299
until he saw the drugs.

1263
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,209
- I understand that normal procedure

1264
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:10,313
is not to call for
backup or make the arrest

1265
01:10:10,314 --> 01:10:13,269
until drugs are exposed.

1266
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:17,089
However, with your view blocked,

1267
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:19,639
you can't say that normal
procedure was followed

1268
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:23,069
or that he didn't draw his gun
before the defendant fired.

1269
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:24,199
- You don't understand.

1270
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,239
- I understand Tommy Quinn
was a longtime friend of yours

1271
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,069
and you want to protect
him any way you can.

1272
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:30,999
- That's not true.

1273
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,349
Before the defendant fired I
could see what was going on.

1274
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:37,409
- But the truth is, that up until the time

1275
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:38,669
the shooting started,

1276
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:41,609
this was an absolutely normal drug deal

1277
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:44,699
and we can't say for sure
who really fired first.

1278
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,359
- That man posed as a drug dealer

1279
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,310
in order to lure Tommy Quinn
down there with a lot of cash.

1280
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,959
It was a premeditated murder robbery,

1281
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,603
that's exactly what it was.

1282
01:11:02,786 --> 01:11:05,306
- [Ray] I'm working Tommy's snitch.

1283
01:11:05,307 --> 01:11:06,649
You know Dolores?

1284
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:09,303
- [Art] You're dreaming,
she'll never come through.

1285
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:13,850
- Maybe.

1286
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,829
I saw Martinez out there,

1287
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:20,040
might be time to consider
adding another man,

1288
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:20,903
what do you think?

1289
01:11:20,904 --> 01:11:23,369
- What do we need more people for?

1290
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:24,769
Every time we get close to something

1291
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:25,899
it blows up in our faces.

1292
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,059
- What's your problem?

1293
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,289
- My problem?

1294
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:30,669
I'm here, how does it look
like I've got a problem.

1295
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:31,859
- You know what I'm talking about Art,

1296
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,649
we're supposed to be a squad, a unit.

1297
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:36,059
- Oh shouldn't you be
giving that speech to Matt?

1298
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:37,789
If he cares you wouldn't
have to go chasing him

1299
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:38,919
all over the place.

1300
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,780
- What if he needs help?

1301
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:41,599
- What if I need help?

1302
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,600
- Do you?

1303
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,493
- I'm asking, that's all.

1304
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:57,559
- Come on Art, I'd be there
for you if you needed me,

1305
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,607
you know that.

1306
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:14,219
- I show you this weapon officer Fisher,

1307
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:16,083
and ask if you can identify it.

1308
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:19,669
- Yes sir, I can, this is the weapon

1309
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:22,079
used to kill officer Quinn.

1310
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,263
- And how can you be
sure it's the same one.

1311
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,289
- Because I scratched
my initials and the date

1312
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:31,269
with a pen knife in the stock,

1313
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:32,420
and they're right here.

1314
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,639
- Your honor, I move that this weapon

1315
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,779
be accepted in evidence
as state exhibit 5.

1316
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:39,780
- So marked.

1317
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:42,779
- Now you saw this weapon

1318
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:46,229
in the hands of the defendant Tron Tron?

1319
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:50,873
- No sir, I did not, it was
concealed prior to the shooting.

1320
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:52,820
- Concealed?

1321
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:56,519
It's a rather sizable
weapon officer Fisher,

1322
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:00,003
could you tell the jury
how it could be concealed.

1323
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:05,283
- [Matt] It was secured behind
a newspaper vending machine.

1324
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:09,309
- Like this one.

1325
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:10,719
- Yes sir, like that.

1326
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,683
- If you'll step down officer Fisher.

1327
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:20,789
Now, after Mr. Tron conferred
with his accomplice,

1328
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:24,201
could you tell us in your own
words exactly what happened.

1329
01:13:24,202 --> 01:13:25,419
- Yes sir.

1330
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:28,219
Mr. Tron came toward the telephone booth

1331
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,463
where officer Quinn was waiting,

1332
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:36,573
and kept on toward the vending
machine where he paused.

1333
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:41,870
- And what was officer
Quinn doing at this point?

1334
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:47,063
- He was just talking on the phone.

1335
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:58,060
Then Mr. Tron pulled
the shotgun from behind

1336
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:02,973
where it was concealed,
and as he came forward,

1337
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:06,093
(gun cocks)

1338
01:14:06,094 --> 01:14:08,133
raised it, pointed at him.

1339
01:14:08,134 --> 01:14:09,141
- Your honor,
- Matt!

1340
01:14:09,142 --> 01:14:11,226
Have him go back to the stage.

1341
01:14:11,227 --> 01:14:12,599
- Office Fisher!

1342
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,266
- Have him go back to
the stage, your honor.

1343
01:14:14,267 --> 01:14:15,719
- He pulled the trigger
and he pulled it again.

1344
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,869
- [Judge] Officer Fisher,
return to the witness stand.

1345
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:19,870
- Matt!

1346
01:14:43,894 --> 01:14:45,709
- [Ray] Hey Matt, what the
hell were you doing in there?

1347
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:47,509
- [Matt] Hey, just
wanted to see him squirm.

1348
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:49,149
- Kadazian says you could
have caused a mistrial,

1349
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:49,983
you want that?

1350
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:50,863
- Hey no, I just told you.

1351
01:14:50,864 --> 01:14:52,609
I just wanted to make the guy sweat.

1352
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:54,619
- Look if we don't blow this
he's going to be executed,

1353
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,500
isn't that enough for you?

1354
01:14:55,501 --> 01:14:56,859
- Now you tell me when that happens

1355
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,113
and I'll hire a band.

1356
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:02,179
- Matt, come on now.

1357
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:03,689
We've got to put this behind us.

1358
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:06,149
If you have something
to say to me, say it.

1359
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:07,279
- You mean the thing about Chi Chi,

1360
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,792
I told you you shouldn't have jumped in.

1361
01:15:08,793 --> 01:15:09,869
- Not about Chi Chi about Tommy.

1362
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:11,079
- I had it under control-

1363
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:11,913
- About Tommy.

1364
01:15:11,913 --> 01:15:12,746
- It was a good caller-

1365
01:15:12,746 --> 01:15:13,746
- About Tommy, damn it!

1366
01:15:17,923 --> 01:15:20,053
- It's over, it's done with.

1367
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:28,529
- You think it's my fault
Tommy's dead don't you?

1368
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:29,363
- I didn't say that.

1369
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:30,270
- That's what you're thinking.

1370
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:31,160
I should have called it off,

1371
01:15:31,161 --> 01:15:32,409
I should have stopped it, right?

1372
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:34,079
- Well, it was your call you made it.

1373
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,819
- You don't believe
that, not for a minute.

1374
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:36,962
Come on Matt, I want to hear it from you.

1375
01:15:36,963 --> 01:15:39,539
I want you to say to my face.

1376
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,556
- What, you want me to say it

1377
01:15:41,557 --> 01:15:43,229
or do you just want to hear it?

1378
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:45,399
- I want you to deal with it.

1379
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,323
- No, you just want to
get hit between the eyes.

1380
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,090
Well I ain't giving you that.

1381
01:16:01,075 --> 01:16:03,492
(door slams)

1382
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,339
- Got another truck coming in,

1383
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,140
60 kilos to move, can you handle it?

1384
01:16:10,882 --> 01:16:12,479
It's that Cuban blood in you Javier,

1385
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,590
makes you think you can do anything.

1386
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:18,729
Make sure your boys are
ready, you do write my meme,

1387
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:20,539
we'll both get rich and live forever.

1388
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:22,575
- That's it, go.

1389
01:16:22,576 --> 01:16:25,159
(upbeat music)

1390
01:16:32,676 --> 01:16:35,593
(tires screeching)

1391
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:40,577
(upbeat music)

1392
01:16:46,396 --> 01:16:48,729
(gun cocks)

1393
01:16:50,851 --> 01:16:53,434
(upbeat music)

1394
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,913
(gun shots)

1395
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,833
(grinder roaring)

1396
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:33,291
(upbeat music)

1397
01:17:38,475 --> 01:17:39,569
- Stop there!

1398
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:41,903
(gun shots)

1399
01:17:54,335 --> 01:17:55,726
Look out Ray!

1400
01:17:55,727 --> 01:17:58,451
(upbeat music)

1401
01:17:58,452 --> 01:18:00,019
(gun shots)

1402
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,976
(Julie wails)

1403
01:18:02,977 --> 01:18:05,310
(gun shots)

1404
01:18:10,537 --> 01:18:12,870
- Hold it right there Mario.

1405
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:20,324
- Matt shoot him.

1406
01:18:22,897 --> 01:18:24,147
Shoot him Matt.

1407
01:18:25,972 --> 01:18:27,555
Damn it, shoot him!

1408
01:18:29,572 --> 01:18:32,817
(gun shots)
(Matt grunts)

1409
01:18:32,818 --> 01:18:35,401
(upbeat music)

1410
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,317
- Tommy's dead,

1411
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:02,382
and there's nothing you could do about it.

1412
01:19:02,383 --> 01:19:05,422
(Mario laughs)

1413
01:19:05,423 --> 01:19:06,388
- Look out Ray.

1414
01:19:06,389 --> 01:19:08,337
(gun shots)

1415
01:19:08,338 --> 01:19:10,838
(phone rings)

1416
01:19:11,778 --> 01:19:14,695
(thunder rumbling)

1417
01:19:28,233 --> 01:19:30,226
- Wiltern.

1418
01:19:30,227 --> 01:19:35,227
Yeah, all right I'll be right there.

1419
01:19:37,008 --> 01:19:39,925
(thunder rumbling)

1420
01:19:49,007 --> 01:19:49,840
- Lieutenant Wiltern?
- Right.

1421
01:19:49,841 --> 01:19:51,609
- I'm sorry to haul you out
in the morning like this,

1422
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:53,539
we practicing Downtown
to find John Stinson,

1423
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:54,701
this is my partner Gobasky.

1424
01:19:54,702 --> 01:19:56,035
This way please.

1425
01:20:01,924 --> 01:20:04,586
(somber upbeat music)

1426
01:20:04,587 --> 01:20:06,373
She looks like just a kid.

1427
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,884
She didn't have any ID on her.

1428
01:20:08,885 --> 01:20:11,163
Nothing in her pocket but your card.

1429
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:19,269
- Her name is Dolores Silva.

1430
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:20,103
- [Police] She work for you?

1431
01:20:20,103 --> 01:20:21,103
- Yeah.

1432
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,723
- You think they made her?

1433
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:28,470
- I don't know.

1434
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,199
- We'll holla for a wagon to pick her up.

1435
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:36,179
Can they call you for an
identification Downtown I mean?

1436
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:37,013
- Yeah they call me.

1437
01:20:37,013 --> 01:20:37,846
Is there anything else?

1438
01:20:37,846 --> 01:20:38,846
- No.

1439
01:20:41,501 --> 01:20:43,243
Thanks for your help.

1440
01:20:43,244 --> 01:20:46,411
(somber upbeat music)

1441
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:07,611
(Ray sobbing)

1442
01:21:09,882 --> 01:21:13,049
(somber upbeat music)

1443
01:21:37,089 --> 01:21:37,922
- [Art] Yeah.

1444
01:21:37,922 --> 01:21:38,922
- Hi.

1445
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:47,200
Hey man, I owe you guys an apology.

1446
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,899
- You don't have anything
to apologize for Ray.

1447
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,450
- I wanted to hold us together,

1448
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:55,580
just to get through this,

1449
01:21:57,255 --> 01:21:58,803
and I pushed us further apart.

1450
01:22:01,306 --> 01:22:03,553
I don't know how to lighten anyone's load.

1451
01:22:05,068 --> 01:22:06,068
- It had to hurt.

1452
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:10,250
We had no business expecting
you to change that.

1453
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,839
- Look, we're gonna spend
the rest of our lives

1454
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,400
wondering if we screwed up with Tommy.

1455
01:22:15,401 --> 01:22:17,207
We just got to deal with it.

1456
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:18,208
- Yeah.

1457
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:21,270
- Let's go to work.

1458
01:22:22,528 --> 01:22:25,695
(somber upbeat music)

1459
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
- [Art] You coming?

1460
01:22:30,664 --> 01:22:33,364
- I got something to do,
I'll catch up with you later.

1461
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,160
- All right.

1462
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,919
- Hey lieutenant, I thought
you guys forgot about me.

1463
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,656
I mean, officer Fisher never called me.

1464
01:23:13,657 --> 01:23:17,629
- Chi Chi, you know a guy by the name

1465
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:19,373
of Mario Portillo Grande?

1466
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:25,793
- Yeah, everybody know Mario.

1467
01:23:32,811 --> 01:23:33,644
- Any verdict?

1468
01:23:33,645 --> 01:23:34,647
- Not yet.

1469
01:23:34,648 --> 01:23:35,481
- What about Matt?

1470
01:23:35,482 --> 01:23:36,519
- He's not at home.

1471
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,570
Landlord says he hasn't been around much.

1472
01:23:39,650 --> 01:23:40,650
- This is it.

1473
01:23:54,314 --> 01:23:57,209
(hammer slams)

1474
01:23:57,210 --> 01:23:58,299
- [Judge] The court has been advised

1475
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:01,003
that you've reached a verdict
in this case, is that correct?

1476
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,609
- We have, your honor.

1477
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:05,610
- Render it please.

1478
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:14,211
- We, the jury, find
the defendant Tran Tran

1479
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:18,469
guilty of murder in the first degree.

1480
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:21,387
(crowd chattering)

1481
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:24,669
- Matt should have been here.

1482
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:25,929
- Thank you ladies and gentlemen,

1483
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,972
court is adjourned.
(hammer slams)

1484
01:24:27,973 --> 01:24:30,556
(upbeat music)

1485
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:03,639
- The jury's in;

1486
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,273
Tran Tran, with double account.

1487
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:09,959
- Great, maybe that'll bring Tommy back.

1488
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,543
(upbeat music)

1489
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:17,949
- Oh, jeez, who gonna need a chiropractor

1490
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:18,950
when she's through.

1491
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:21,670
Friend of yours?

1492
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,000
- Everybody here is my friend.

1493
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:30,588
- Don't you think it's time
to get the team back together?

1494
01:25:30,589 --> 01:25:32,495
- Well, that's gonna
be a little difficult.

1495
01:25:32,496 --> 01:25:36,376
Did I mention that Tommy's
not with us anymore?

1496
01:25:36,377 --> 01:25:39,813
- All right Matt, that's
enough, it's over.

1497
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:41,860
Whatever you think happened,

1498
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:43,809
whatever you think of me it's done,

1499
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:45,013
we have our jobs to do.

1500
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:47,950
You know there are drug dealers

1501
01:25:47,951 --> 01:25:49,109
like Mario Patillo out there,

1502
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:50,849
they're not sitting this out,

1503
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:52,389
they're out on the
street doing their thing.

1504
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:56,399
- Ray, do you really think that
pushing Mario off the street

1505
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,733
is going to stop anything?

1506
01:25:57,734 --> 01:25:58,567
It's not going to stop anything.

1507
01:25:58,568 --> 01:25:59,799
It's even gonna even slow him down.

1508
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,803
- That's why we have to keep coming.

1509
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:05,880
If we let them rip us
apart, they are winning.

1510
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:11,373
Stop running away Matt, stop hiding.

1511
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:14,982
- Just trying to decide whether or not

1512
01:26:14,983 --> 01:26:16,815
I still wanna be a cop.

1513
01:26:16,816 --> 01:26:19,399
(upbeat music)

1514
01:26:30,696 --> 01:26:33,589
- Listen to me pal, is it there or not?

1515
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:34,740
Are you sure this time?

1516
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:37,840
Done.

1517
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,153
- Deal set?

1518
01:26:43,153 --> 01:26:44,153
- Set.

1519
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:47,542
- This guy's got a hell of an operation.

1520
01:26:47,543 --> 01:26:48,543
- Yeah.

1521
01:26:49,326 --> 01:26:50,976
That's what Tommy always told us.

1522
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:56,446
(somber upbeat music)

1523
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:22,099
- We got something working?

1524
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:23,829
- Yeah, I guess you could say that.

1525
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:24,830
- It's big.

1526
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:29,560
- Sounds like my kind of party.

1527
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:34,703
So what do you say Jerry,

1528
01:27:34,704 --> 01:27:36,353
you feel like riding with me?

1529
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,040
- You bet.

1530
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:47,150
- Let's do it.

1531
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:56,710
(suspenseful music)

1532
01:28:16,642 --> 01:28:17,919
- There he is.

1533
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,003
- We got him.

1534
01:28:29,305 --> 01:28:31,972
- [Chi Chi] He's alone, number 9.

1535
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:36,709
- We're going in.

1536
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:37,733
- Showtime.

1537
01:28:40,147 --> 01:28:42,730
(upbeat music)

1538
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:01,759
All right, he's alone in number 9.

1539
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,599
You men back us up.

1540
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,600
Let's go.

1541
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:08,910
(suspenseful music)

1542
01:29:09,934 --> 01:29:13,684
(speaks in foreign language)

1543
01:29:31,015 --> 01:29:32,015
Mario!

1544
01:29:34,762 --> 01:29:35,762
Come on.

1545
01:29:36,747 --> 01:29:39,330
(upbeat music)

1546
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:42,639
Jerry.

1547
01:29:44,655 --> 01:29:47,238
(upbeat music)

1548
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,823
Art, take the fire escape.

1549
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,383
(upbeat music)

1550
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,117
Julie!

1551
01:30:26,118 --> 01:30:28,701
(upbeat music)

1552
01:30:55,505 --> 01:30:56,755
- Thanks Mario.

1553
01:31:00,058 --> 01:31:03,875
(speaks in foreign language)

1554
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:06,293
- I know what to do, come on.

1555
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:16,030
- Hey lieutenant.

1556
01:31:21,723 --> 01:31:23,371
- [Ray] Good man Jerry.

1557
01:31:23,372 --> 01:31:24,205
We did it-

1558
01:31:24,206 --> 01:31:25,357
- [Art] All right.
- [Matt] All right.

1559
01:31:25,358 --> 01:31:28,146
- [Julie] Wait a go.
- [Art] Yeah.

1560
01:31:28,147 --> 01:31:31,601
- [Ray] And Mario, take
a good look at that view,

1561
01:31:31,602 --> 01:31:34,507
that's the last you're gonna
see it for a long time.

1562
01:31:35,636 --> 01:31:37,106
- [Matt] Looking good.

1563
01:31:37,107 --> 01:31:39,690
(upbeat music)
