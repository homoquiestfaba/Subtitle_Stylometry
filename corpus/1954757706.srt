1
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:18,283
The littlest schmoop
in the chicken coop goes...

2
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,120
Moop, moop, moop.
Moop, moop, moop.

3
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:24,189
Moop, moop, moop.
Moop, moop, moop.

4
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,960
<i>The skinniest schmoop in</i>
<i>the chicken coop goes...</i>

5
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,262
<i>Scoop, scoop, scoop.</i>

6
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,564
<i>Scoop, scoop, scoop. 'Cause he's
getting all that food, right?</i>

7
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:33,832
<i>Scooping it all up.</i>

8
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,012
<i>A charter school in southwestern
Los Angeles, California.</i>

9
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,455
<i>Mitch Carter is head of</i>
<i>Truman's English department,</i>

10
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:59,491
<i>and was recently named
California Teacher of the Year.</i>

11
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,727
<i>He is now a nominee</i>
<i>for the national award.</i>

12
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,364
Love my job. Not every
day of course.

13
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:07,466
But, uh, it's a good life.

14
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,441
<i>Ronald Douche</i>
<i>is the school's principal.</i>

15
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:18,544
Start now? Okay.

16
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,512
Um, welcome.

17
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:25,084
Truman is, uh, a newer
high school, opened in 2007.

18
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:28,487
<i>Our first senior class just</i>
<i>graduated this last spring.</i>

19
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:30,422
We serve, uh,
over 1,000 students,

20
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,959
most of them from right here in
good old southwestern Los Angeles.

21
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:36,695
Some kids back there.

22
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,965
Hey, guys.

23
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,269
Terrific.

24
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:01,186
<i>We are fortunate enough to have some
of the latest technology available.</i>

25
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,021
<i>Beautiful chemistry labs.</i>

26
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,958
<i>They did such a nice</i>
<i>job on the installation.</i>

27
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,161
<i>Two well-stocked computer labs</i>
<i>training on many programs.</i>

28
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,463
Great start, great
foundation, great base.

29
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,499
We'll have a giant hammer
come up here with a claw.

30
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:18,370
<i>And of course, our nationally
ranked robotics team.</i>

31
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,613
Gonna shoot something out.
Oh, this is a great start.

32
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:36,755
In 1999, I was writing for Mattel
toys for their Barbie doll website.

33
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,024
"Barbie for president."

34
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,761
I was, uh... I was supposed to be
writing Barbie's election platform.

35
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,364
Um, you know,
more swimming pools.

36
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,726
No brown shoes
with black pants.

37
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,976
Six months later,
I was a teacher.

38
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,288
<i>This is a tough part of town.</i>

39
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,657
<i>The kids know it's</i>
<i>not gonna be easy.</i>

40
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,993
<i>We're giving them hope.</i>
<i>Throwing them a rope.</i>

41
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,556
The kids are
appreciative of that.

42
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,399
You know, of what
we do here for them.

43
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,068
For the community.

44
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,905
It's, uh... Wow, I'm getting
a little filled up here.

45
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:30,742
But, uh,

46
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,413
I take a lot of pride in that.

47
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:39,685
You know what? It's pronounced
"Dow-shay," not Douche!

48
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,019
Dow-shay.

49
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:44,690
It is the same spelling
but the Dutch pronunciation!

50
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,558
That is it, young man.
That is it. I see you.

51
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,195
That is detention. Detention
for the entire year.

52
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:54,499
Put the cameras away.
Put them away. Put them away.

53
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,935
Turn off those... Okay, you know what?
As soon as I'm done here,

54
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,404
that is it for you.
Confiscated. Both of you.

55
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,286
Phones are going to be gone.

56
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,846
It's pronounced "Dow-shay."

57
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,121
<i>Okay, let's get settled in!</i>

58
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,891
This is not a bad dream. It is Monday.
You are back in class.

59
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:23,562
I want you to take out your journals and
take a look at the topic on the board.

60
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,632
I want you guys to write about
something that you like.

61
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,200
But you hide it
from your friends

62
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,402
because you are afraid
of what they will think.

63
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:34,339
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I'll go first. Um...

64
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,877
When I was in high school,
I really loved the ballet.

65
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:44,249
My mother used to take me to see
<i>The Nutcracker</i> every Christmas.

66
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,084
But I was afraid that my
friends would make fun of me,

67
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,526
so I told them that she was
taking me to a Laker game.

68
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,957
All right, you guys are
up now, you got 15 minutes.

69
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,461
<i>I like to start class</i>
<i>with a writing exercise.</i>

70
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,897
<i>It gets their brains</i>
<i>in the right place.</i>

71
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,065
<i>Especially on a Monday.</i>

72
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,771
Okay, let's share
our responses.

73
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:10,208
Oh, come on, I told
you about the ballet.

74
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,810
It's all downhill from there.

75
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,879
Zola.

76
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:17,349
Sometimes when I'm depressed, the
only thing that makes me feel better

77
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,185
is listening to <i> Dora the</i>
<i>Explorer</i> song on my iPod.

78
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,456
Marcus.

79
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:29,728
Uh, um, one time when I was
visiting my grandparents,

80
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,531
I woke up in the middle of the
night to take some Advil,

81
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,166
but it was my grandpa's Viagra.

82
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,350
You were supposed to write about
something that you liked!

83
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,939
Did you like that?

84
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:45,877
Are you going to be talking
to the other teachers, too?

85
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,045
Um...

86
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,448
I just...
I think it's important.

87
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,851
And this is why. I mean, yeah,
I'm, uh, "Teacher of the Year."

88
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,753
That's... And which is
great, and I love it.

89
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,355
I love that you guys are
here doing this movie.

90
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,190
I think it's important.
I hope we can show something

91
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,792
about public schools
and what's happening here.

92
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,428
But, uh, the award itself,

93
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,200
is really the byproduct of all of our
work together here at this school.

94
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:12,704
Yes, I won it,
but, um, you know...

95
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:17,008
I don't do this by myself, I
guess is all I'm saying. Right.

96
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,380
These kids don't get better just
because I show up and do my thing.

97
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:25,183
<i>I'm not laughing. I'm being serious here.
You come on.</i>

98
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:28,053
We are the Hammers. Uh, though
we're not married. No, we are not.

99
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,222
My name is Clive Hammer.
I am Lowell Hammer.

100
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,857
And we are guidance counselors.

101
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,725
Well, we're college counselors.

102
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,560
But we guide you to college.

103
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,229
So we're kind of like...

104
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,997
Religious leaders.

105
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,065
Shamans.

106
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:44,102
I think it's shayman. Well, shayman
suggests that we shame them.

107
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,270
Which we're not afraid to do.

108
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,471
Which we will use shame.

109
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,572
So...

110
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,642
We will answer questions.

111
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,978
We've got experience.
We speak from the hip.

112
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,080
We throw it from the kneecap.

113
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,681
We toss it. Which is
even lower than the hip.

114
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,117
Yeah, well, some guys, some
guys will talk from the hip.

115
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,553
We take it from the kneecap. We like
to throw it from below the hip.

116
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,555
We just toss it out to you. Which
is even a straighter shot.

117
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,857
Yeah, it's a straight shot,
straight into your mouth.

118
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,559
Think about it like this.

119
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,961
If college were hell...

120
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,296
And it is, guys.

121
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,431
For a while, it's hell.

122
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,732
Best time of your life,

123
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,434
best years of your life, but it's hell.
But it's hellish.

124
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,537
It's like a burning inferno of
hell and hatred. It's terrible.

125
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,173
Think of us as like a two-headed dog.
Mmm-hmm.

126
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,375
And we're sitting on that
River Styx in a boat...

127
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:24,976
Right, and we gotta
take you across.

128
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,078
You can't swim to the River Styx.
No, you can't.

129
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,847
You can't do that. I'd
like to see you try it.

130
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,549
I wish you could try.
I dare you.

131
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:31,983
You're going to
burn your legs off.

132
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,819
But you get with us...
You're in the boat.

133
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,987
We take you across. We guide
you to where you need to go.

134
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,389
We get you to hell.
Yeah.

135
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:41,393
I think the secret is,
we know everything,

136
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,028
assume that they know nothing.

137
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,032
You have to start from that point
and then work your way backwards.

138
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,134
Or forward.
Forward.

139
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,569
Or laterally.
Yeah.

140
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:54,072
You asked when the
applications are due for UCLA.

141
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,974
Those were due yesterday.
Yesterday.

142
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,076
Yesterday. So, that is, uh...
Ouch.

143
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,644
A no-can... That's a no-fly zone.
That's not good.

144
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,315
Yeah, so, uh, forget about
that one. USC tomorrow.

145
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:07,185
Exactly, so, six essays, you knock
'em out tonight. You're good to go.

146
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,720
5-Hour Energy.

147
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,790
Pop one of those in your mouth,
boom, boom, boom. You're gold.

148
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,192
Get a get a couple
of Coke Zeros and...

149
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,927
None of those calories.

150
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:19,264
But you are still learning and
you are still staying awake.

151
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,565
Can she...

152
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,734
Can she do that? You just
hop out of here right now

153
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,302
and just start on that process?

154
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,570
She can't?
She can't.

155
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,805
Okay. Look, you cram it tonight.

156
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,968
Tonight. You'll
get in there tonight.

157
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,345
The problem is that
teaching is tougher today.

158
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,080
Because they put
hormones in the milk,

159
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,882
so the girls start to
menstruate at a younger age.

160
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,149
It's awful.

161
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,585
How do you know that?

162
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:41,887
Morning, guys.

163
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,356
Hey, morning, Wendy.
Morning, Wendy.

164
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,592
That's a lot of wrong answers
there, Eric. Mmm-hmm.

165
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,061
Hey, check it out, Wendy's not
wearing any underpants today.

166
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,297
Jesus, do your
kids know anything?

167
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,099
That grading machine
sounds like gunfire.

168
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,834
I am aware of
the results, Brian.

169
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,803
You guys are worried about tests?
She's going commando. You kidding me?

170
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,772
Did you see these scores?

171
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,441
Dude, I know you're married, but just
look for my sake, would you please?

172
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,176
The average is 14.

173
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,845
I can't even talk to you.
Do you have a penis?

174
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:10,615
Hey, Wendy. I brought that vanilla
creamer that we both enjoy.

175
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,393
Bam!

176
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,663
Belly button showing!

177
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:25,764
Bam!

178
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,670
Cell phone and belly
button showing, that's two.

179
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,307
Enjoy your Saturday, with me.

180
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,634
Uh, hey there, Marv
Collins, assistant

181
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,314
principal and dean of
students at Truman High.

182
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,836
Actually, Mr. Collins,
you can just look at me.

183
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,820
So uh, you help Principal
Douche run the school.

184
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:52,090
Principal Douche does not need
my help running this school.

185
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,594
I think you can tell he's doing a
pretty good job all by himself.

186
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,295
You're not hiding the
cell phones from me.

187
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,964
You know you're
getting detention.

188
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,699
And you still have
the cell phones out.

189
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:03,101
<i>No, yeah, I'm just the
garbage man, you know.</i>

190
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:07,372
Someone sees a future ahead of them,
but you still have yours out.

191
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,808
Put the cell phones away!
Put the cell phones away!

192
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,777
As you probably saw, we had a
little kerfuffle this morning

193
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,313
between a couple
of our young men.

194
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,248
<i>Uh, not</i>
<i>their first go-round.</i>

195
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,885
But let me tell you,
it better be their last.

196
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:24,556
Because one more infraction,
and they're out of here.

197
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,505
<i>You get in a fight this morning,
you're back in class this afternoon.</i>

198
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,747
How's that work?

199
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,642
I don't know.

200
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,411
Wanna tell me
what it was about?

201
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:49,581
Boy, I hope that's not true, I
mean if you're gonna hit somebody,

202
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,082
you better have a reason.

203
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,250
I got a reason.

204
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,818
Yeah, yeah, I'm
sure it's excellent.

205
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,220
Aren't we gonna be late?

206
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,454
Yeah, hurry up.

207
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,689
Late for what?

208
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,058
Uh, soccer practice.

209
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,428
<i>This is the first year Truman's
fielded a varsity soccer team.</i>

210
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,197
<i>Although I'm not sure</i>
<i>you can call this soccer.</i>

211
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,702
<i>I'd like to see us win a game.</i>

212
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,838
<i>Or maybe just score</i>
<i>a goal. That'd be nice.</i>

213
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,611
<i>Most days I'd settle for</i>
<i>a practice field with grass.</i>

214
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,283
Okay, shake it off, Derek.

215
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:31,589
Hey, you're California Teacher of the Year.
These guys know who you are.

216
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,124
What? You're telling me that
you didn't recommend me?

217
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,893
Absolutely I did,

218
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:38,930
but they'd already seen the article in
<i>The Times,</i> picture of your family.

219
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,465
They asked me about you.

220
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:46,604
The National Independent School
Association sent you to come get me.

221
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,039
This is what I'm
telling you, yeah.

222
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,576
To lobby for them. What the
hell do I know about lobbying?

223
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,846
Well, it's not like you'll be the only one.
It's a team.

224
00:11:54,848 --> 00:12:00,452
A veteran teacher who's had success in
both public and private classrooms.

225
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,020
To do what?

226
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:06,725
To go on TV, uh, make speeches,
appear at schools, symposiums.

227
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:10,929
They want you to be the new
face of independent schools.

228
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,701
And 120,000 to start.

229
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,006
Are you... Are you serious?

230
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,375
To start.

231
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:28,079
Plus an expense account, moving
expenses, unbelievable health benefits.

232
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,748
Uh, moving expenses.

233
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:35,053
Well, uh, we're in D.C.
about two weeks each month.

234
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,422
Some people decide to just
move out there, some don't.

235
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,623
Ah, D.C., I don't
know if I can do that.

236
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,326
Like I said, some
don't. I didn't.

237
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,208
And you don't have
to decide right away.

238
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,832
So this is a job offer?
It's not a job interview?

239
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:54,572
Well, you're gonna have to meet
with the NISA director, Ellen Behr,

240
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,441
but, honestly, the way
she talks about you,

241
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,443
I think she just
wants your autograph.

242
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,215
<i>Are you interested in that job?</i>

243
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,184
I don't know.

244
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,419
I mean, a lot of
changes to consider.

245
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:11,956
Um, the travel, for one.

246
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,478
How much does Truman pay you?

247
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,721
If you don't mind me asking.

248
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,365
A little under 70.

249
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,670
Is that why you're smiling?

250
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,606
Not just that, it's
just, you know, I'm...

251
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:33,111
When you teach, you kind of forget what
it's like to have a real job, and um,

252
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:36,548
I guess I thought maybe
I'd never have another one.

253
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,630
You don't consider teaching
to be a real job?

254
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,693
Well, you just spent
the day with me. Do you?

255
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,491
<i>Oh, I'm so hungry!</i>

256
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,861
I'm so hungry, I want some
belly, I want some belly!

257
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,130
Mmm!

258
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:57,001
Oh, the belly
so good! So good!

259
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,837
I couldn't possibly
eat any more belly!

260
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,239
I'm so full.
Oh, wait! Yes, I can!

261
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,676
So, uh, what's this?

262
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,546
Uh, the National Independent
School Association website.

263
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,789
Who they are, what they do.

264
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,251
How's it look?

265
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,721
Oh, you know.
Um, tax exemptions,

266
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,210
uh, school vouchers,
looking out for the

267
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:22,060
interests of rich kids
and their rich parents.

268
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:25,542
It's basically everything I've ever
fought against for my whole career.

269
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,800
<i>Nobody proofreads!</i>

270
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:31,369
This guy says his paper
is about Mark Train.

271
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,139
Unbelievable.

272
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,507
They're not all like that.

273
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,976
Hmm.

274
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,845
Look, Daddy, I drew a princess
and she's saying, "I love you."

275
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,347
Aw, that's beautiful, angel.

276
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,182
You spell better than
Daddy's students.

277
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,785
Stop it.
Mmm-hmm.

278
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,555
Listen to this.

279
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:56,060
"The boy said, 'I was hungry, hungry,
hungry. This shows he was hungry."

280
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,850
Teacher of the Year, huh?

281
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,281
You know, I'm real happy

282
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,750
that you guys are giving Mitch
Carter all this attention

283
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,186
and you're here to see
him, but it's Ron Douche

284
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,322
who's the motor
behind this house.

285
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,525
He's the kid in the hamster
wheel, so to speak.

286
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,595
This guy's gonna be
superintendent of LA Unified.

287
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:34,565
I'm hitching my wagon to that star.
Best believe that.

288
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:38,903
I mean, he says put this campus
on lockdown, it's locked down.

289
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:42,440
Miss Curtis, Nia cannot come
to school dressed like this.

290
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,542
Why not? She
looks good.

291
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:48,379
Nia, you can't...
Look at your skirt.

292
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,415
Leave something
to the imagination.

293
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,784
Why should I make them imagine it
when I can just show it to them?

294
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,819
You know, but, I've had
enough of this, all right?

295
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,854
She is beautiful.
I am beautiful.

296
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:59,657
I was a JV cheerleader
when I had her. All right?

297
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,459
That out of here.

298
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,729
Uh, uh... Uh, yes.

299
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,298
Okay, let's get started.

300
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,335
I have your <i> Huck Finn</i>
papers for you,

301
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,404
and, uh, I see that a lot of you
are still making the same mistakes

302
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,307
because you
refuse to proofread.

303
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:20,144
Uh, look, if it's a problem
with spelling or vocabulary,

304
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,481
I can help you with that, but when the
name of the book is <i> Huckleberry Finn</i>

305
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,350
and you spell
Huckleberry wrong...

306
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:29,454
I can't do anything for you there.
Or you spell your own name wrong?

307
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,590
Come on, Mr. Carter,
nobody did that.

308
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,994
Oh, no, yeah, somebody did, Marcus,
or should I call you "Macrus."

309
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,767
Ladies and gentlemen, in the eyes
of the law, you are still children

310
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,970
but here, in this
classroom, you are adults.

311
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,705
So as much as I may
disagree with you,

312
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,807
I have to respect your
decision not to get smarter.

313
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,369
This is America, where the Constitution
protects your right to stay dumb.

314
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,923
"Brendan had a bellyache
and had to get more sleep."

315
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,359
"Please execute him."

316
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,297
I wish I could, Novak.

317
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,901
Wait, so you guys are here because
Mitch Carter won Teacher of the Year?

318
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,023
Wow, I, I didn't even know
a decision had been made.

319
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,442
I guess I was busy then. And
that's for the whole city?

320
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,177
Whole state.

321
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,579
Whole state. Okay, that's...
He's a good guy.

322
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,183
Really nice cat.

323
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,986
Can I speak frankly for a
second, because I'm sorry,

324
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:39,891
Okay, that's a dead language. The kids
already speak it when they come to school.

325
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,427
I'm dealing with
the future. It's robotics.

326
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:46,097
I mean, in my class
on Monday, it's Wednesday.

327
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,801
All right, let's assimilate.

328
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,738
All right, now you guys have won
the last four city championships

329
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,706
and today we're going
to make it number five.

330
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,676
But more importantly,
when the robots take over,

331
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,112
and that day's coming
sooner than people think,

332
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,848
you guys are going to be ready.

333
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,618
And you're going to be waiting
for them, just like me. Okay?

334
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,054
Let's fuse.

335
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,231
<i>Four years in a row we've lost the
National Robot Championships,</i>

336
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,934
otherwise referred to as
the Super-Robot Bowl.

337
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:26,704
Today's the cities, city
robots, we always rule that.

338
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,706
And state robots,
we fly through.

339
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,909
We've had problems with
the national robots.

340
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,147
Not this year.
Not this year.

341
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:42,053
<i>I guess, I mean, I'm just a little
disappointed in your behavior.</i>

342
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,521
I mean, aren't you?

343
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,390
And if I suspend you, you're
just going to feel like

344
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,159
you're getting an extra
week of spring break.

345
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,161
So instead, you're gonna have a
week of in-house suspension.

346
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,883
Are you...
Uh-uh-uh...

347
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,702
Now, Mr. Carter believes that
soccer's been a good outlet for you.

348
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,437
Yeah. Yes.

349
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:02,373
He also feels that, uh, you should be
allowed to continue playing and I agree.

350
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,142
Thank you, Mr. Douche,
thank you.

351
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,977
But he has also promised me

352
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,546
he'd have you run sprints
for an extra 20 minutes

353
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,047
after practice
every day next week.

354
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,450
Are you...
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

355
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,860
Now take a pretzel.

356
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,360
Not in here.
Alex, crumbs.

357
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,030
Jeez.

358
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,469
There's not a lot of
time during the day

359
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,505
to teach a young man or
woman a lesson like that.

360
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,643
So, hopefully I got through to him,
made a difference in his life.

361
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,411
That guy's a dick.

362
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,556
Seriously, like,
these are not lockers.

363
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:57,662
This is for mail, and news,
and bug spray... I'm just...

364
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:01,766
Oh, hey, Steven, just got <i> The
Titan</i> hot off the presses.

365
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,034
Oh, nice.
Yeah.

366
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,769
Yeah, you guys are doing
some great work down there.

367
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,438
Yeah, you gotta check out the piece we
did on the water fountain in the gym.

368
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,407
Yeah, we tested
it for bacteria.

369
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,209
Covered in microorganisms.

370
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,110
That's fantastic. How long
have you been teaching here?

371
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,580
Uh, this is my first year.
My first full year.

372
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,248
Almost a full year. Started
as a sub last year, yeah.

373
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,283
This is great. I'm really
making the paper my thing.

374
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,152
I'm really proud of what the
students are doing. Yeah. Super.

375
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:24,655
And I'd like to think... That
article about Kathy Bannen's puppy?

376
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,357
Yeah, yeah, that's
gonna be great.

377
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,593
It'll teach a lot of
kids responsibility

378
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:31,195
about taking care of puppies
and stuff, and that's, uh,

379
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,930
something the kids
need to learn about

380
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,733
before they go on to college.
Fantastic stuff.

381
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:36,968
Good job, Ian.

382
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,704
Thanks, um...

383
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,674
What's happening, kids?
Hey, man.

384
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,876
Looking at our conference schedules.
Who do you have this year?

385
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:49,614
"Why is my kid an idiot?" "'Cause
you're an idiot." In and out.

386
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:52,783
You're serious?

387
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,118
Am I the
only one who does that?

388
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,186
That's genius.

389
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,888
That's just wrong, not genius.
That's a good idea.

390
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,023
That's a brilliant
idea, is what that is.

391
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:02,660
Yeah, Teacher of the Year, right there.
There you go.

392
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,196
Where's my vest? Oh!
Where's my vest?

393
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:07,131
I'm the vest guy.

394
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:09,967
It's fun to joke
around in the lounge.

395
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,604
But I love this job.

396
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,274
I love the kids, I love math.

397
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,743
Um, most days I cannot
wait to get to work.

398
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:22,513
The magic math hat
goes to Lamont.

399
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:27,118
Yay, yes, thank you, thank
you, please, please.

400
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,156
Thank you, Lamont, thank you
so much for being so smart.

401
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,027
But I have to ask,

402
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:41,165
what is the mnemonic
device, sohcahtoa?

403
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:44,902
<i>I'm fired up about teaching.
I do it with passion.</i>

404
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,637
<i>I don't apologize for it.</i>

405
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,974
<i>And I expect my students to match
my passion with their own.</i>

406
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,676
<i>I think they</i>
<i>appreciate the effort.</i>

407
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:53,577
<i>At the very least</i>
<i>they're entertained.</i>

408
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,912
Emmie?
Cosine.

409
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:59,050
Cosine, cosine!

410
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,685
- Are you rolling now?
- Yeah.

411
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,520
That is so cool.

412
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,889
I mean...

413
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,664
It's like...
It's like we're...

414
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,763
It's like <i> Spinal Tap</i>
or something.

415
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,232
It's like we're just teaching
and you guys are filming.

416
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,734
It's a little creepy, but...

417
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,673
I take my teaching, and I
turn it up to 11. To 11.

418
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,644
I was never really good at accents, but...
Eleven... No?

419
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:30,014
You don't know
<i>Spinal Tap?</i> Wow.

420
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,982
- I say turn down the job.
- Are you nuts?

421
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,751
Teaching's his calling.
Take the money.

422
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:36,053
Teaching's obviously not about
cash, it elevates the spirit.

423
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:39,090
Oh, my God, do not listen to him, Mitch,
this is just Berkeley jibber-jabber.

424
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:42,893
Because I can be, and I'm
older than you, all right?

425
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:46,364
Look, 10 years from now you'll be
making almost the same as you do now.

426
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,232
And you'll be killing yourself
for not taking this job.

427
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,634
Why is this the only way for
me to make this kind of money?

428
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:54,105
I love teaching, you know, apparently other
people think I'm pretty good at it, too.

429
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,673
Why can't I make
100 grand doing this?

430
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:59,176
Because you can't.
Take the money.

431
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,712
If I'm coming on strong,
that's not my intention.

432
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,246
I just feel really
confident that advertising

433
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:06,283
with us is gonna
help your business.

434
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:09,186
<i>I'm the sales director at a
local mixed media company.</i>

435
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:12,289
<i>They let me work from home three days
a week, which is really helpful.</i>

436
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,226
If we are right for you,
then we are perfect for you.

437
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,895
<i>You know, we just</i>
<i>want to meet your needs.</i>

438
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:21,098
<i>That's all. If you're not happy,
if it's not working for you,</i>

439
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,534
<i>then I'm not doing my job.</i>

440
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:28,139
Yeah, I'm not interested in just making
this sale and leaving you hanging.

441
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:31,442
<i>No, I'm gonna use my customized
software to monitor your account</i>

442
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:34,412
<i>and make sure that your ad</i>
<i>is generating sales.</i>

443
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,182
<i>Yeah. Oh, gosh,</i>
<i>it's unbelievable.</i>

444
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:41,786
<i>It tells us who's noticing your ad, where
they're shopping, what they're buying.</i>

445
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:46,257
<i>I can do that.</i>
<i>Yes, I can do that.</i>

446
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,160
<i>I can do that, too,</i>
<i>that sounds very fair.</i>

447
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:52,843
<i>It is a lot to promise but I hope that
shows you how much I want your business.</i>

448
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,333
Okay.

449
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:59,775
All right, I'll send the contracts
over first thing in the morning.

450
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,273
Okay. Thank you.

451
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,176
Bye-bye.

452
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,513
Yay.

453
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,985
Mitch, I admire your success in both
the public and private sectors.

454
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:18,589
And I think your career highlights the
best qualities of independent schools.

455
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:21,058
Well, come on, you can't really
compare Harry Truman Charter

456
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,259
to Episcopal Academy.

457
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,028
Charter schools walk the line.

458
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,831
They're public schools that take advantage
of many of private schools' benefits.

459
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,866
Private and charter are
practically the same thing.

460
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,569
That's a very difficult
argument to make, Miss Behr.

461
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,971
I couldn't agree with you more.

462
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,180
How would you make it?

463
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,411
Well, um, let's see.

464
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,552
They both have entry requirements
greater than residency.

465
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:52,523
Uh, they both ask for a personal
commitment of time or money or both

466
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:55,860
from the student, and frequently
from the student's family.

467
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:59,697
As a society, we choose to spend
tax dollars on enrollment and fees

468
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,232
at charter schools
like Truman High.

469
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:04,168
There is no reason why
a few of those tax dollars

470
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,637
couldn't go to private
school tuitions as well.

471
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,973
Even if it's not as much.

472
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,075
A fraction.

473
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,878
So, you can make that argument.

474
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,549
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, would appear so.

475
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,089
So, does that mean you
want the job now?

476
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:28,259
No, no, it just means
I know I can do it. I...

477
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:31,695
What the hell?

478
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,238
Brian, what's going on, man?

479
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,940
I got a problem.

480
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:45,242
What, what's happening?
Ron suspended me today.

481
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,677
What? Why?

482
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,480
Faith Gregory accused me of
attacking her in tutorial today,

483
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:50,848
and you know I did not do that.

484
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,483
No, no, of course,
I know, I know, I know.

485
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:55,119
Guys, please, just give me a
second, all right, please?

486
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,620
Just back off, please.

487
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:02,459
She's an angry child, there has
to be something going on at home,

488
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,727
and it's important...

489
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,029
All right, have you heard
from her parents at all?

490
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:06,664
No. Have you talked, spoken
to her mother or father?

491
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,499
No, the mother, I know has
been in contact with Ron

492
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:13,771
<i>Oh, this is bad, this is so bad.
Brian's in a tough spot.</i>

493
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:18,442
<i>I'm the union rep at our school,
so he's supposed to come to me.</i>

494
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:21,245
<i>Plus, we're friends.</i>
<i>Good friends.</i>

495
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,327
We'll talk tomorrow, all right?

496
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,157
Who is this girl?
This is unbelievable.

497
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:36,827
Her name is Faith Gregory, and,
uh, he failed her last semester.

498
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:40,030
He was trying to help her. I mean, that's
why she was in his room to begin with.

499
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:43,901
Well, can't Ron at least wait until he
hears the story from everybody else first?

500
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:46,870
No, he can't afford to, Kate.
I mean, what if Brian did it?

501
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,073
You think he did it?

502
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:51,508
No, of course not,
but, you know,

503
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,344
Ron's just got to
cover his ass.

504
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:55,813
Mitch, language, please.

505
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:58,916
Oh, sorry, hey, sweetie, can you go to your
room and play for a little bit, please?

506
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,985
Okay, Daddy.
Thank you.

507
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:02,686
I'll be in to read you
a book in a little bit.

508
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,088
Okay.
Okay.

509
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,790
Can I say "ass" now?

510
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,160
Oh, my gosh,
Jackie is pregnant.

511
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,629
How is she handling this?

512
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:14,431
I don't know, he's gonna give
me a call after he told her.

513
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,433
He hasn't told her yet?

514
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:20,270
Well, it's not like I'd be rushing home
to share the news with you either.

515
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,373
Huh.

516
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,842
Oh, my gosh, that is beautiful.

517
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,010
Man.

518
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,311
Oh, it's got a pool.

519
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,847
A pool, we can go swim!

520
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:34,151
3,200 square feet, four
bedrooms, four baths,

521
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:38,422
and it is $414,000.
No.

522
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:42,026
That could get
us a garage here...

523
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,394
That's quite...

524
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:44,796
in Los Angeles.
That's unbelievable.

525
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:48,032
A big difference
from what we pay here.

526
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:51,535
I don't know, it sounds
like the interview went well,

527
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:55,239
but, also, like, there's gonna be
way more travel than we expected.

528
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,477
And, uh, even if we do move to Washington,
D.C., he's gonna be gone a lot.

529
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,116
He and Sierra have never
even been apart for one day,

530
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,786
so I'm not exactly sure
how she's gonna take that,

531
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,657
but I don't even think
we really have a choice.

532
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:16,593
You know, my job
sucks, and, uh,

533
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,996
I can barely handle that
with one baby, much less two.

534
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,968
I mean, when are we gonna get another
opportunity like this, you know?

535
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,344
Is it a boy?

536
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,747
Don't start that.

537
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:39,717
Oh, come on, I'm just asking.
Does it feel boyish?

538
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:43,721
I'm at six weeks, it doesn't
feel like anything yet.

539
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,803
Um, okay, guys, let's
just wrap for the night.

540
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:55,290
Okay, thank you.

541
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,492
Morning, guys, let's have a
great day of instruction, huh?

542
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:23,927
How you doing? Pull up those pants,
young man, I can see your underwear.

543
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,729
That's ridiculous.

544
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:29,099
Why do you even have a belt?
Hey, high five, up top. Nope?

545
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,902
We'll do that later. We will
do that later, young man.

546
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,437
All right. Go back to
your office, Douche!

547
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:37,407
Who said that?
You there, I see you.

548
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:39,877
Yeah, Mitch found out that Truman was
looking for new department chairs,

549
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,645
and we applied
at the same time.

550
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,281
Why leave a private school
like Episcopal to come here?

551
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:49,319
I think Mitch was looking for the challenge
of starting a school from day one.

552
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,681
Me, I just came 'cause
the pay was better.

553
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,124
Any regrets?

554
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,327
The kids at Episcopal were more gifted.
I miss that.

555
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,030
I mean, you saw my class today.

556
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,867
Okay, yesterday, we talked
about motors and motion.

557
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:06,570
Can anyone name something
that has a motor?

558
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,105
Motorboat?

559
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:10,741
Yes, a motorboat
does have a motor.

560
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:11,943
Anybody else?

561
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,997
Fandra?
A vibrator?

562
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,119
Yeah, that's great.

563
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,087
Look, my best
students are fantastic.

564
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,369
They'll go on to UCLA, Stanford,
and they'll be great.

565
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,553
But some of these
other kids, I, uh...

566
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,697
I am just at a loss to
explain their behavior.

567
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,165
We're gonna watch a short film.

568
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,328
Is this a physics movie,
or a good movie?

569
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:41,238
Yes, Lamont, today we're
going to watch <i> Scarf ace.</i>

570
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,911
It can be tough sometimes.

571
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,582
Very tough.

572
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:55,452
I'm not saying you're an idiot. I'm
saying what you're saying is idiotic.

573
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,187
Well, I don't see what's...

574
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:01,258
they're born in the light of
Uranus and they think it means...

575
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,229
Oh, come on.
That is way too easy.

576
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,965
You know what? I get that joke
too much. Don't even go there.

577
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,534
Okay, I get that too much,
look, don't even go there.

578
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,536
How does that hurt
anyone's feelings?

579
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,805
Have you seen
Ursula Featherstone's class?

580
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,108
It's unusual.

581
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,978
Okay, our quarterly
test is tomorrow,

582
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,547
and I think the best way for
us to review our two books,

583
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:27,918
<i>The Miracle Worker,</i> about Helen Keller, and
<i>The Diary of Anne Frank,</i> is through song.

584
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,620
So here we go.

585
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,665
And you're her supervisor? Yeah.

586
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:17,701
Yeah, um, so yeah, I've sat
through her class many times

587
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:20,270
and, I gotta tell you,
even though it is unusual,

588
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,906
her kids retain a lot
of what she teaches them.

589
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,975
And her tests scores, they
always show improvement.

590
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:26,576
This is what I'm trying
to tell you, you know,

591
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:29,246
each teacher reaches
the kids in their own way.

592
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:32,783
Um, there's no one
way to do this job.

593
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,585
You're always looking for
the new, better, shinier way

594
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,522
to deliver basically
the same old message.

595
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:41,925
You know, the thing is,
if the message is solid,

596
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,393
it's always worth learning.

597
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,429
Okay, guys, how are you?

598
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:48,117
How's everybody doing? We
are the Hammer brothers.

599
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:49,433
My name is Clive Hammer.

600
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,902
I am Lowell Hammer. We
like to bring the hammer.

601
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,804
Stop.
Hammer time.

602
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,539
Which is what we said. That's
how long we've been doing it.

603
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,740
We've been doing
it for years, guys.

604
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,942
So, you probably don't
remember MC Hammer,

605
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,677
but we've been doing
it back since his day.

606
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:01,979
Yeah, when he had a day.

607
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,113
And, uh...

608
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:06,350
Think of us as liaisons
between you and college,

609
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:09,186
and some of you might not
know what liaison means.

610
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:13,790
Think of us as the people who
define the word "liaison" for you.

611
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:17,027
I asked for help with
my financial aid application,

612
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:20,197
and they told me to mark
my ethnicity as caramel.

613
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:21,965
Caramel. Why wouldn't
we do our job?

614
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,266
Who doesn't like caramel?

615
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:26,903
You see caramel on an application,
you're like, "I want a piece of that."

616
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,972
You hear that word...
I want a piece of that...

617
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,073
you start to salivate.

618
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:33,377
Right? Pavlovian,
you salivate, kid's in.

619
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,448
They said that if I want to go to
Stanford, I have to wear more hats.

620
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,784
They said Stanford
likes "hat people."

621
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:42,119
Palo Alto's a hat town.

622
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,488
Stanford is like a huge hat school.
Yeah.

623
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,823
I mean, you're not wearing a
hat, you're not fitting in.

624
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,258
And if you don't know that,

625
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,428
then you're not doing your
job as a college counselor.

626
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,865
They said colleges would like
me better if I lost 60 pounds.

627
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:57,701
So, I'm bulimic now.

628
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:00,737
But it's for my education,
so it's okay.

629
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:02,973
That was unfortunate.

630
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:05,842
That was not our plan.
That was not a great...

631
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,878
I mean, she just kept...

632
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,614
But if you look at her now, look
at her now, she looks pretty good.

633
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:11,848
If she just keeps it...

634
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,183
If she doesn't
go any further...

635
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:14,584
She's good.

636
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,888
You don't need any of
these states right here.

637
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,123
Yeah, forget these states, these
are just full of fat, mad people.

638
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,559
That's right. You see these states?
Fat, angry people.

639
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,228
As you can see right in
here, this is the Big Ten.

640
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,363
Lot of football.

641
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:27,564
Lot of drinking.

642
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,032
Lot of keg stands.

643
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,467
This is where you want to be.

644
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,436
So, I mean, that is
college right there.

645
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:33,937
Yeah, if you think
about college,

646
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:36,306
think about a guy
passed out in a bush...

647
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,608
Urinating on himself.
All over his own pants.

648
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,677
Like a homeless person would.

649
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,646
That's University of
Illinois right there.

650
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:44,381
That is literally...
In a nutshell.

651
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:46,716
On the crest, that is what it is.
Mmm-hmm.

652
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,219
And then also, we're out here, guys.
We're in California.

653
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:50,887
You can stay here at home.

654
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,589
If you don't want to go all the way
out over here, stay here at home.

655
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,824
Why?
Three words.

656
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:56,460
Weed is legal.

657
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:57,861
Nailed it.
Yeah.

658
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:59,596
I don't know how we do it.
It's magic.

659
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,432
There are times when I
wake up and I wish I knew.

660
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,234
And then there are times
when I wish I didn't know.

661
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:05,869
And right now is
one of those times.

662
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,938
Where I wish I didn't know

663
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,661
that I do know. And
you still don't know.

664
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:15,112
I'll take it from here. I know
what you guys are thinking.

665
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,780
"I gotta get to
New York City."

666
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,015
Right, bicoastal.
"Get me to the Big Apple."

667
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,684
Hightail it up there! No.
No.

668
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:22,352
That is a bad idea. You are
gonna get cut. Horrible.

669
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,054
Each and every one of you.
You're gonna get cut a lot.

670
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:25,789
We got cut. Went to New York City.
Yeah, we did.

671
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:26,890
We got cut twice.

672
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:28,058
Same guy.

673
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,593
And that, more than
anything, tells you,

674
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:33,296
don't go see a matinee of <i> Spider-Man
the Musical</i> on a Wednesday.

675
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,564
Not during the middle
of the week, you don't.

676
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,234
Why you gonna go up here?
Hightail it down here.

677
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,669
Amish country. Pennsylvania,
Franklin and Marshall University,

678
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,772
great school, go out there,
you roll an Amish guy.

679
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:47,611
It's fun, right? Get a couple cocktails
in you, get out there with some friends.

680
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,012
They're not gonna fight back.

681
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,747
Maybe they'll
throw a butter churn at you.

682
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:51,915
Maybe.

683
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,479
Second place, city finals.

684
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:02,646
I mean, forget nationals, we
don't even qualify for states.

685
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,829
Should've seen the first place trophy, too.
It was a silver cup.

686
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,098
Just like, I could've drank my
coffee out of it in the morning,

687
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,381
but now it's just me
and the little guy, so...

688
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:15,839
There will be no Super-Robot
Bowl 5, that's for sure.

689
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,783
<i>The Scarlet Letter</i> gives Hester the
power to see the sin in others.

690
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,119
So she knows that nearly
everyone in the Boston area

691
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:30,720
believes that they're sinners.

692
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,690
But when they learn of Hester's
public sin of adultery,

693
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,559
they jump at the
chance to punish her

694
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:38,195
because they want to prove
their purity to everyone else.

695
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:40,297
Now, Hawthorne
tells us that everyone sins.

696
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:43,867
Going back to Adam and Eve failing
God in the Garden of Eden.

697
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,235
And we feel so guilty.

698
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:48,071
"Oh, no, God is
disappointed in me."

699
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:50,273
We feel bad and it sucks.

700
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,976
If we would just let
each other's mistakes go,

701
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:54,611
we'd be so much
happier, but we don't.

702
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:57,147
No, we're constantly trying
to make each other feel bad,

703
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:59,516
hoping that it will
make us feel better.

704
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:02,085
And that is where
evil comes from.

705
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:04,888
Not from the devil,
not from hell.

706
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:09,559
Evil is simply a byproduct
of human fear and weakness.

707
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,627
All right, how 'bout Claudius?

708
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:12,229
He dies like a bitch.

709
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,730
All right.

710
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,966
Uh...
Yeah, that's a start.

711
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:18,535
Do you have a citation from
the play to back that up?

712
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,904
Yeah, I wrote it down here.

713
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:24,507
"O, yet defend me,
friends, I am but hurt."

714
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,878
It's good. Good,
you got one for Ophelia?

715
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,160
I use Act IV, where she goes crazy,
just before she kills herself.

716
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:34,944
Wrote it here.

717
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:41,558
"Young men will do't, if they come
to't, by cock, they are to blame."

718
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,894
Um, why'd you
choose that quote?

719
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,763
I don't know.
She said "cock"?

720
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,698
Yeah, you went deep
there, didn't you?

721
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:54,404
Young men will do it, if they come
to it, by cock, they are to blame.

722
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,640
It's better than that crap you
pulled in my class on Monday.

723
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:57,841
Aw, Coach, why you
gotta play me like that?

724
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,309
Did you have any lunch?

725
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:00,443
Nah, I didn't have any lunch.

726
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,978
Take half my sandwich.

727
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,046
Thanks.

728
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,749
Next up.

729
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:07,017
<i>Thanks for coming, Mitch.</i>

730
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:09,786
Uh, well, yeah, no, we
gotta get right on this.

731
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,422
Well, um, I'm all over it.
I spoke to the mother.

732
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:15,292
We're gonna meet with them and
Mr. Campbell tomorrow afternoon.

733
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:17,761
Good. Good. Okay, I'm glad we're
dealing with it right away.

734
00:38:17,763 --> 00:38:19,396
Yeah, me too.

735
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:23,700
Oh, God, if the media gets ahold of
it, then Brian's career is over.

736
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:26,062
Yeah. You're
kidding, right?

737
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,705
What?

738
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:31,708
Mitch, Brian's finished. At this point
I'm just trying to protect the school.

739
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,143
But he didn't do anything.

740
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:36,980
Why? Because a girl who's
failing his class says so?

741
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:39,983
Look, Mitch, I'm not insensitive
to Brian's situation.

742
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,418
It's just that the
school cannot afford...

743
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,153
He's got a family, Ron!

744
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:46,589
Have you ever heard of one of these
problems resolving itself peacefully?

745
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:48,458
The teacher always
takes the fall.

746
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,328
Right, because bureaucrats like you
are pushing him off the cliff.

747
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,863
I spoke to the girl.
I spoke to her mother.

748
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:57,000
Did you speak to Brian? I mean, five
years he has bled for this place.

749
00:38:57,002 --> 00:39:01,571
Did you talk to Brian, or did you just
fire him and send him on his way?

750
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:02,739
I don't have time for this.

751
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,307
I'd like an answer
to my question.

752
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:08,211
Mitch, be here tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.
This meeting is over.

753
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:14,718
Thing about Ron is, he has
his own managerial style.

754
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,087
There's worse. There's
worse principals than Ron.

755
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:18,588
No, okay, guys,
what are you doing?

756
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,657
We shouldn't be talking
about our boss on camera.

757
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:21,725
He's an idiot.

758
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:23,526
Okay.
I could've... That's...

759
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,096
Ron Douche couldn't lead three
people out of an elevator

760
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,230
with a map and a flashlight.

761
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,565
Eric.

762
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,567
Come on, that's a little harsh.
Whatever.

763
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:32,969
I don't care.
I got tenure.

764
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,676
It's not that I don't
like Ron Douche.

765
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:42,011
I don't like the way
he does his job.

766
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:45,014
I don't think he's
here for the kids.

767
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:48,184
Are you here for the kids? Or are
you here for your next promotion?

768
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,582
I don't really know her
very well, I just...

769
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:54,824
Just by reputation.

770
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,494
What I do know is that
Brian has such a good heart.

771
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:58,995
I just don't believe it's true.

772
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:02,232
Yeah, Brian's in serious trouble.
But he knows better.

773
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:06,770
You never let yourself be alone
in a room with a student,

774
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:10,273
girl or boy, or even two.

775
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,143
They work in teams sometimes.

776
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:14,577
And they see me,
I'm down in the gym,

777
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,713
I'm on the treadmill,
shorts, tank top,

778
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:18,782
a lot of times I get
sweaty at lunch.

779
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:20,517
You don't know what these
kids are gonna think.

780
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,119
And at that age,
they can't resist.

781
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,757
So, I need to be the one
who steps up and says,

782
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,393
"Not today, mister, or missus."

783
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,295
"Or both of you."

784
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:37,367
Yeah, yeah, we know
the Campbells very well.

785
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:39,969
The guys met in college,
and then

786
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:43,406
Jackie and I are really close.

787
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:46,709
I mean, she's
one of my best friends.

788
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,980
<i>I don't know, I'm just...</i>

789
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:54,083
<i>I'm dying inside for this</i>
<i>woman, but I swear to God,</i>

790
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,252
<i>I have no idea</i>
<i>what to say to her.</i>

791
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,562
What's going on at that school,
what's been going on at that school,

792
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:06,963
is disgusting.

793
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,933
And people need
to hear about it.

794
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:13,136
We've just been
bystanders this entire time

795
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,572
and I had no idea
how that would

796
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:18,575
end up hurting our family.
And people need to know.

797
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,613
If it wouldn't have been us, it
would've been somebody else.

798
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:26,416
I don't understand how
someone so young

799
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:28,918
could be so full of hate.

800
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,653
So full of

801
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:34,257
just vile and viscous anger
to lash out like this.

802
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:37,160
And I hate to say it,

803
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,462
but the person that I look to
is the mother.

804
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:42,065
And I don't understand how
she could've let this happen.

805
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:46,836
And you know, I'm about to
become a mother and I...

806
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,839
Uh, I hate to be so judgmental,

807
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:53,409
but if in 18 years I've
become like that woman,

808
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:56,846
I don't know how I
could live with myself.

809
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,417
This is the crib from
Kate and Mitch, you know.

810
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:04,420
They gave it to us right after we told
them that we were having Jackson.

811
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:05,622
Yes.

812
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:08,758
And then now, of course,
they need it,

813
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,894
but they're letting us keep
it 'cause they're...

814
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12,595
They're just wonderful, and...
Yeah.

815
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:15,265
And they've been there
for us, through this, too.

816
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:17,634
They were the first
ones that we told, and...

817
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,838
I met with a lawyer, which is

818
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,043
bizarre, and I never expected

819
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:32,715
to actually be in the situation
of having to defend myself.

820
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,985
And I waited for a phone call

821
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:39,522
from, uh, my principal,
Mr. Douche.

822
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:43,826
And, uh, that didn't come.

823
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:47,597
So I'm expecting to
have to defend myself,

824
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,700
tomorrow, and uh...

825
00:42:54,438 --> 00:43:00,209
And hopefully be able
to take care of my family.

826
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,684
<i>To say that</i>
<i>parent-teacher conferences</i>

827
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:09,752
<i>tend to cause some anxiety</i>
<i>amongst the faculty</i>

828
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,721
<i>would be a gross</i>
<i>understatement.</i>

829
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:14,257
<i>We've got a diverse bunch</i>
<i>of personalities</i>

830
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,139
<i>and we all deal with the night</i>
<i>in our own way.</i>

831
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:28,938
<i>Personally, I can't say I dislike
them because sometimes they're great.</i>

832
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,106
We know he's not
studying enough.

833
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,909
We took away his computers,
telephone, his TV.

834
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:34,744
That's good, that's all good.

835
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:36,279
<i>It's an important part</i>
<i>of our job,</i>

836
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:37,880
<i>and when a</i>
<i>conference goes well,</i>

837
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:39,315
<i>it can really make</i>
<i>a difference.</i>

838
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:42,018
Well, let's talk about some
strategies you can employ, okay?

839
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,721
If you would just turn the
television off for five minutes

840
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:46,122
and let him do his homework...

841
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,758
Oh, how's the view from
the grandstand, Phil?

842
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,462
I'm the one raising him while you're
out vacationing with your whore.

843
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:55,064
<i>In reality, though,</i>
<i>it's usually a long night.</i>

844
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:58,234
And normally, I like the kids to believe
that there are no stupid questions,

845
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:03,373
but sometimes I think Marcus asks
questions just to disrupt my class.

846
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:05,541
Really?

847
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:09,112
Can you give me an example?

848
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:12,148
Well, last week,
in the middle of a quiz,

849
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,651
he raised his hand to ask me
if I had ever considered

850
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:16,653
how weird the Teletubbies are.

851
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:19,155
I love that moment when I tell the
mother what her kid's been up to

852
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,623
and she makes that face.

853
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,127
What?

854
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:26,329
<i>I call it the</i>
<i>"I'm gonna smack his ass</i>"

855
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,498
<i>"with a hairbrush in the</i>
<i>parking lot" face.</i>

856
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,800
The "I'm gonna smack his ass with a
hairbrush in the parking lot" face

857
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:33,569
may not be my favorite thing
about teaching,

858
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:36,572
but it's definitely
in the top five.

859
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:39,342
Ooh, angry parents.

860
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,910
Rough night, rough night.

861
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:42,712
I don't like getting yelled
at, I'll tell you that much.

862
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:44,047
What is wrong
with them. Whew.

863
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:48,317
You might be the worst guidance
counselors of all time.

864
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,819
I take that as a compliment.
I like that.

865
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:51,654
I'll tell you why, because

866
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:53,956
what would be worse
is if you said nothing.

867
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,959
We provoked a reaction.
Yeah, it's what we do.

868
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:58,928
You told students in my class

869
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,363
that they probably
wouldn't survive the day.

870
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,231
Some of them won't or didn't.

871
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:03,594
I don't know about that.

872
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,835
Got a rise out of you.

873
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:07,670
Mrs. Rose, simply put,

874
00:45:07,672 --> 00:45:10,440
your son is too stupid to
be on the robotics team.

875
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:12,608
How dare you say anything
like that about my son!

876
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,910
No, it's not me,
it's nothing personal.

877
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:16,245
I'm just wondering, uh,
did you drop him as a child?

878
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:18,781
Was he deprived oxygen
for over three minutes?

879
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:21,150
How dare you say anything
like that about my son!

880
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:22,952
All I'm saying is, if he
doesn't get his act together,

881
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:26,489
then I'm gonna design a robot
specifically to choke him out.

882
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:29,225
Um, Eric and I do a cover band.

883
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,260
This is one of the things...
Talk about Teacher of the Year,

884
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:33,029
and I think a lot of times,
guys who go out

885
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:37,066
and do all kinds of
extracurricular activity, um...

886
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,935
They have to make it happen.

887
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:41,104
Yeah, and you know, we show the kids...
Not just in the classroom.

888
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:43,506
Right, we show the kids that
there's a world outside of school.

889
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:45,875
Mmm-hmm. And so we
have a cover band.

890
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:48,244
It is of a band
I was a big, uh, fan of,

891
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,379
it's called the Indigo Girls.
Hmm.

892
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:51,914
Yes, it's one of your
favorites, isn't it?

893
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,217
It is true, and so it's a duet.

894
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:55,585
Uh, duo.

895
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:57,920
And so, one problem is...

896
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,923
I don't... I don't play the guitar.
Not a note.

897
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,658
And, uh...
And I don't sing.

898
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,661
No. But the... Unfortunately it was
a duo, so I needed someone else

899
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:06,929
and you had weekends free,

900
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,898
and so we'll do a gig down
at like Ruby Tuesday's.

901
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,234
You have no control over these kids.
I see.

902
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:12,535
You haven't taught
my son one thing.

903
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:15,171
He has not learned one
thing in your class!

904
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:16,739
Mrs. White, may I
ask you a question?

905
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,074
Oh, you have a question for me?

906
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:20,510
Yes, if you don't mind... Oh,
really, what... What is it?

907
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:22,311
Why did you come here tonight?

908
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:23,913
Excuse me?

909
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:26,315
If you came here to find
out how your son can do

910
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:28,751
better in my class
and get a higher grade,

911
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:31,020
we can keep on talking.

912
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:33,422
But if you've come
here to yell at me,

913
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:35,024
then this conference is over.

914
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:37,493
<i>Boom, baby!</i>

915
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:38,761
I love it.

916
00:46:38,763 --> 00:46:40,196
Don't you wish...
Nice.

917
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:41,898
All I wanted to say.
Oh, I love that.

918
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,199
Thank goodness
somebody said it.

919
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:46,002
I swear to God,

920
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:48,971
I would give back half my
salary if they would let me

921
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,240
- punch a parent once a year.
- Yes!

922
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:52,482
Just once!

923
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:55,411
So, we play <i> Closer to Fine,</i>

924
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:57,113
and we'll do it at
local establishments.

925
00:46:57,115 --> 00:47:00,783
And, uh, it's
the only song I know.

926
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:02,451
And I don't know it at all.

927
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:05,788
No, uh, that's a problem,
'cause he doesn't, uh...

928
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,824
But I look good, so...

929
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:09,225
And it's a duo, so we
have to do it together...

930
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:10,593
I add color.

931
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,598
You add maybe too
much color sometimes.

932
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,667
Anyway...
In some of the places we play it,

933
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:18,935
you know, it's...
No, it...

934
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:21,098
It's not a colorful bar.
Sometimes...

935
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:31,547
So, Alex has been
improving lately,

936
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:33,816
but he does
very little homework.

937
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,432
She says she doesn't
know what to do because

938
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:51,467
I lie and tell her
that I did my homework,

939
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:54,036
but she can't check because
she doesn't speak any English.

940
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,773
<i>Si.</i>

941
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:00,109
<i>Si.</i>

942
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,483
Hey there.

943
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:10,853
People will say we're in love.

944
00:48:10,855 --> 00:48:12,688
Parent-teacher
conference, huh?

945
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,490
I don't miss those.

946
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,459
I didn't know you taught.
Oh, three years.

947
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:18,828
Wasn't for me.

948
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,665
Look, John, um, I'm
interested, uh, I really am,

949
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:25,835
but I just... I'm gonna
need a couple of days.

950
00:48:25,837 --> 00:48:27,737
Well, my advice was
to leave you alone,

951
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,906
let you make up your own mind,

952
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:31,407
but I got overruled.

953
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,410
In favor of what?

954
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:38,247
They told me to come right over
here and raise the offer to 150.

955
00:48:41,853 --> 00:48:45,421
$150,000?
To start.

956
00:48:52,497 --> 00:48:55,298
You're their
number one draft pick, Mitch.

957
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,033
Look, you call me tomorrow.

958
00:48:57,035 --> 00:48:58,734
Let me know what you wanna do.

959
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,844
Can I ask what you're thinking?

960
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,417
Uh, I'm thinking it's
an amazing opportunity.

961
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,788
I'm thinking it
could change my life.

962
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,423
So what's the problem?

963
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,760
I'm trying to decide whether
or not my life needs changing.

964
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,526
- You have to hear him out.
- Please.

965
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:58,961
I've heard this before.
This idea...

966
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:01,564
- It's a great idea.
- Thank you, thank you.

967
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:02,999
Let's just stop
right there, okay.

968
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,800
I'll tell you why it's a
great idea, because we have

969
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:06,836
the oldest, wealthiest,
healthiest generation

970
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:09,238
retiring now, that are still useful.
That's right.

971
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,941
They can contribute. My father,
my father is 70 years old,

972
00:50:11,943 --> 00:50:14,643
he's a surgeon, they're about to
force him out of the operating room.

973
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:15,945
What the hell's he gonna do?

974
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:18,180
He's gonna live another 40 years
with today's technology...

975
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,715
They will not let that...
He's gonna go crazy.

976
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:22,284
He should be here,
teaching AP biology,

977
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:25,688
coaching the golf team and making
a contribution, like he wants to.

978
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,591
Here's what's gonna
happen with that idea.

979
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:30,826
Once you leave this
building with an idea,

980
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:33,896
it's gonna go to the bureaucracy,
and once they get ahold of it,

981
00:50:33,898 --> 00:50:34,964
they're gonna shut it down.

982
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:37,066
Not when they
realize it's feasible!

983
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:40,136
So, it's impossible to change.

984
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:41,837
It's impossible to change.
No, you need to start,

985
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,305
you need to change from within.

986
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:46,042
Thank you. You need to... Hey,
who's the union rep? That's you.

987
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,444
Yeah. So, we need to
go in through you

988
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:49,612
to get them to
change the rules.

989
00:50:49,614 --> 00:50:50,980
Exactly why I...

990
00:50:50,982 --> 00:50:53,282
<i>No, I wouldn't say</i>
<i>I'm worried about Mitch.</i>

991
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:56,118
I just wish he'd find more
ways to have fun with his job.

992
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,890
And how does the man begin
the act of intercourse?

993
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,926
Anybody? Lamont?

994
00:51:03,928 --> 00:51:05,628
He puts his penis in her thing?

995
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,863
In her thing.

996
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:09,131
No, no.

997
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:11,100
It's called a vagina.

998
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:14,070
It's a lovely word.

999
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:16,338
Vagina. Vagina.

1000
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,808
It's lovely.

1001
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:22,078
How many jobs do you
know that you get paid to

1002
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,246
make teenagers feel nauseous?

1003
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,486
Kian, homework.

1004
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:32,888
Oh, I... I couldn't do it, Mr. Carter.
It was raining.

1005
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:36,859
What does that even mean?

1006
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,296
Okay, guys, we have our
test on Wednesday,

1007
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:43,332
so that means I need
all your journal work.

1008
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:46,368
Can I have some quiet, please?

1009
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,104
Everybody, get quiet.

1010
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,539
Quiet, please!

1011
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,490
Marcus, if you don't shut up, I'm
gonna throw you out that window.

1012
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,915
Whatever, it's
only two stories.

1013
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,754
You guys are killing me.
You're killing me!

1014
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:10,659
When his face
turns all red like that,

1015
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:13,295
he just cracks me up.

1016
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,566
<i>On Thursdays, I have lunch
duty in the courtyard.</i>

1017
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:20,669
<i>Uh, kids like to tell me what's
going on in their lives.</i>

1018
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,872
<i>Really wish they'd</i>
<i>stop doing that.</i>

1019
00:52:22,874 --> 00:52:26,175
I cheated on my chemistry test.
He didn't even see!

1020
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:29,411
Jenna and all her skanky friends
still talk crap about me.

1021
00:52:29,413 --> 00:52:30,946
I just think it's funny.

1022
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:33,048
Can't get this
itch on my left nut.

1023
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,610
Ah, thanks for the update,
Novak, I appreciate that.

1024
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,057
Audrey, do you need something?

1025
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,326
I'm his girlfriend.

1026
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,729
You're his girlfriend?

1027
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:48,097
How is that possible?

1028
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:00,376
Wow, your students are
so into your class.

1029
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:02,478
Well, don't sound so surprised.

1030
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,216
No, no. It's just... It's not... It's
just, I've seen the school's test scores.

1031
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,118
And the history department's
are the lowest.

1032
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,787
By quite a bit, unfortunately.

1033
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:14,423
Why do you think that is?

1034
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:17,726
Our department lacks

1035
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:19,461
depth.

1036
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:22,631
So you can see here, very clearly,
where the country was divided

1037
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:24,967
during the Civil War.
Uh, fun fact,

1038
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:28,537
Kentucky was sort of the
Switzerland of, uh, the Civil War

1039
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,539
because they were neutral.

1040
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:33,976
Uh, another fun fact, uh, North
Carolina is where my parents live,

1041
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:36,946
so... And, um,
the Mason-Dixon Line is

1042
00:53:36,948 --> 00:53:39,748
what actually divided
the North and the...

1043
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,984
Guys, can you just please
listen to me?

1044
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:43,752
I'm really... Look, no...

1045
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:45,854
No one cares about
this stuff, all right?

1046
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:48,991
I'm not gonna pretend that they do.
You'll never need to know this again.

1047
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:51,860
But for today, I need you
to know this, all right?

1048
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:54,797
I just... Can you just take one
standardized test that says

1049
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:56,765
you've learned anything
that I've taught you.

1050
00:53:56,767 --> 00:54:00,102
Just even like a 25%
would be enough for me

1051
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:02,805
to keep my job and my
crappy little apartment

1052
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:05,040
and I can drive
my used Honda Civic

1053
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:07,276
back to the house that
I cry myself to sleep in.

1054
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:09,912
You know what, fine, I will
go to the principal's office.

1055
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:13,382
I will... Does that not
mean anything to you?

1056
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:17,486
What do I say to this kid?

1057
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:19,221
What do I say to her mother?

1058
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:21,857
Try to pin them down
on something factual.

1059
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:27,229
The only way this is all gonna turn
out well is if you get the facts out.

1060
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:31,734
And choose your
words carefully.

1061
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:35,304
As soon as you make a judgment
on the girl or her mother,

1062
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:39,975
But I'm not just gonna sit there and
let Brian get buried for something...

1063
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:43,012
I'm not telling you to.
Just remember that the parent

1064
00:54:43,014 --> 00:54:45,581
sees their child as an
extension of themselves.

1065
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:47,449
There's nothing more
personal to them.

1066
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:50,352
Right, right.

1067
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:53,622
Oh, Brian Campbell, that
guy's going down hard.

1068
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:54,890
It's gonna be ugly.

1069
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:57,393
So glad I don't have
to go to that meeting.

1070
00:54:57,395 --> 00:54:59,862
I have a colonoscopy
this afternoon,

1071
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:01,964
not really looking
forward to that either.

1072
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:06,035
It goes to show you how much I do
not want to go to this meeting.

1073
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,437
As he...
He didn't do it!

1074
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:09,772
He's a predator.
He is not a predator.

1075
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:11,907
You ever been to the
teachers' lounge? Yeah.

1076
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,710
And you reach for the French
vanilla coffee creamer?

1077
00:55:14,712 --> 00:55:17,346
One time, he took it
from you as you guys were

1078
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:19,315
both reaching at the same time.
And used it up.

1079
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:20,783
That's not predatory.
And used it up.

1080
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:22,117
That is not predatory.

1081
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:25,554
I... I was fearing for my
sexual well-being. Oh, come on.

1082
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:27,556
I'm praying for him.

1083
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,286
Last night, I prayed for him.

1084
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:34,330
Jackie.

1085
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:36,598
She's being as
supportive as she can be.

1086
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,334
'Cause I didn't do it.

1087
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:40,369
Yeah, of course.

1088
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:42,652
Still killing
her on the inside.

1089
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,776
And when they fire me... Come
on, man, you don't know that.

1090
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:49,945
Ron has to fire me.

1091
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:51,280
It's what I would do.

1092
00:55:51,282 --> 00:55:54,650
Just try and keep it
together, please, all right?

1093
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:57,853
My career.

1094
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:59,855
It's over.
Hey!

1095
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,156
What am I gonna do for a job?

1096
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:03,659
Will you stop whining
about the future

1097
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:06,762
and focus on right now, okay?

1098
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:09,231
Protect your family,
protect yourself.

1099
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,333
It's not done.

1100
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,136
Ah.

1101
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,378
Ah.

1102
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:28,550
I'm just gonna...
Can I...

1103
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:33,122
Yeah, go, go, we got time.

1104
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,460
I'm just gonna...

1105
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:43,298
Go, go.

1106
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,870
I'll be right back.

1107
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:58,080
Shit.

1108
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:12,060
I was doing a problem
on the board

1109
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:15,864
and he came up behind me
and he started

1110
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:19,001
massaging my shoulders
and then he slid

1111
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:21,703
his hands down the front of me
and started rubbing my breasts.

1112
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:23,272
It's okay, Faith, you don't
have to go into details.

1113
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:25,374
She will have to discuss them
with the police, however.

1114
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:28,143
Well, it was my understanding,
from our phone conversations,

1115
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:30,379
Mrs. Gregory, that you wanted
to keep the police out of this.

1116
00:57:30,381 --> 00:57:31,480
I swear, I didn't do anything.

1117
00:57:31,482 --> 00:57:32,581
Yes, you did.

1118
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,616
For God's sake,
Faith, please...

1119
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,819
Mr. Campbell, please control yourself.
You're disgusting.

1120
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:39,988
If he says one more word
to her, we're leaving.

1121
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:42,458
So, it's Brian, Mitch,
the girl and her mother.

1122
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,926
No lawyers?

1123
00:57:43,928 --> 00:57:46,528
Apparently, Ron is
working as hard as he can

1124
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,896
to keep the whole
thing off the record.

1125
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:50,032
Well, why am I not
surprised by that?

1126
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:53,235
I don't know, but if I was going
in to a meeting like that,

1127
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:55,237
I wouldn't want
Mitch representing me.

1128
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:57,573
Really? Who else
would you pick?

1129
00:57:57,575 --> 00:58:00,042
I don't know, but... I don't know,
Mitch would be my first choice.

1130
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:02,244
He's a really good man
to have your back. Yeah.

1131
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:04,046
That's the problem.
He's too good. He's too nice.

1132
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:06,181
Wrong.
Okay.

1133
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:08,417
Mitch is good.
He's not nice.

1134
00:58:08,419 --> 00:58:09,785
What's the difference?

1135
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:11,887
He's a good man, but
you get on his bad side,

1136
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:14,122
teacher, student,
anybody, good luck.

1137
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:15,524
- Faith...
- I did nothing wrong.

1138
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:17,493
You're going to
jail, you bastard!

1139
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:20,462
Okay, all right, let me just
interject here for a second, okay?

1140
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:23,499
Um, Faith, I understand
that you're upset, and, uh,

1141
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:26,668
none of us are suggesting... You think
you can just grab any girl you want

1142
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,904
because you're the big boss?
I did nothing wrong.

1143
00:58:28,906 --> 00:58:30,739
You call grabbing
my boobs nothing?

1144
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:32,541
No, no, that is awful, Faith.

1145
00:58:32,543 --> 00:58:34,243
He shouldn't work here.
And he doesn't anymore.

1146
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:37,079
Hold on, hold on, Faith,

1147
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:39,781
right now you
just went like this

1148
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:41,617
when you talked about what
Mr. Campbell did to you.

1149
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:44,253
But earlier, you said
that he was behind you.

1150
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,924
Oh, right, that's...
That's what I meant.

1151
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:50,526
What difference does it make
where they were standing?

1152
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:52,661
I don't think we have
to rehash all the details...

1153
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:54,863
Just a second, Ron.

1154
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:57,833
Faith, I understand that you
don't like Mr. Campbell's class.

1155
00:58:57,835 --> 00:58:59,735
And clearly you
don't like Mr. Campbell.

1156
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:01,203
- I hate him.
- And that's okay.

1157
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,471
That's enough,
Mr. Carter.

1158
00:59:02,473 --> 00:59:05,440
You're about to
ruin a man's life.

1159
00:59:05,442 --> 00:59:08,010
And his career.
Maybe send him to jail.

1160
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:10,612
So what we need
from you, right now,

1161
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:12,114
is to tell the truth.

1162
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:13,549
How dare you!

1163
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:17,031
My daughter is not on trial.
Did Mr. Campbell touch you?

1164
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,089
He was looking at
me like he wanted to.

1165
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:26,061
But he didn't, did he?

1166
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:32,067
- No.
- Faith!

1167
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,635
Thank God.

1168
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:36,104
You shouldn't have
failed me, you asshole!

1169
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:37,873
What is going on here?

1170
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:41,076
I assure you that we'll do whatever
it takes to resolve this issue.

1171
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,881
- That was pretty rough.
- How're you feeling?

1172
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,620
Like I've been doing this
job for a hundred years,

1173
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,283
with a hundred more to go.

1174
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:01,430
John, hey, it's Mitch.

1175
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:03,298
Hi, how you doing?

1176
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,034
Yeah, um...

1177
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:08,370
I'll take it. I'll do it.

1178
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:10,872
Yeah.

1179
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:12,374
Listen, let me talk to you
about the details later, okay?

1180
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:16,211
I just... Okay, great.

1181
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:18,513
Great. Thank you. Bye.

1182
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,965
Daddy!
Hey, hi.

1183
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:41,169
Hello.
So, what happened?

1184
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:43,538
You're not going to believe it.

1185
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,906
She made it up.

1186
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:46,875
What? How do you know?

1187
01:00:46,877 --> 01:00:48,477
She admitted it.

1188
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:50,278
Oh, my God.

1189
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,713
I know, right.
Oh, my God.

1190
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:53,815
Yay, family hug!

1191
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:57,452
Oh.

1192
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,656
It's over.

1193
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:02,391
How did it happen?

1194
01:01:02,393 --> 01:01:03,925
I squeezed it out of her.

1195
01:01:03,927 --> 01:01:06,895
What, are you on <i> Law & Order
</i> or something? I could be.

1196
01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:08,930
I'm gonna go call Jackie.

1197
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:11,800
Um, hang on,
hang on. I, um...

1198
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:15,837
I, um...

1199
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,205
I took the job.

1200
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,009
You did?
Yeah.

1201
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,847
Well, it's good.

1202
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:28,283
It's good, it's gonna be good.

1203
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:30,585
I know.
It'll be all right.

1204
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,287
Yeah.

1205
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:44,966
I'm making my peace with it.

1206
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,802
The money is unbelievable.

1207
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:48,937
<i>And when the baby comes,</i>
<i>Kate will be able to</i>

1208
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:51,973
<i>take as much time off</i>
<i>work as she needs.</i>

1209
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:54,509
<i>Maybe she won't</i>
<i>have to work at all.</i>

1210
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,748
<i>It was the right decision.</i>

1211
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,651
You wanna put him in the car? Let
him go to the movies or something?

1212
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,829
Just coffee for breakfast?

1213
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:15,430
Yeah, I gotta get
to school early.

1214
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:17,332
Well, let me at least
finish making your lunch here.

1215
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:19,267
No time, gotta go.

1216
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:22,571
What's the rush?

1217
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:25,340
Well, I have to finish grading
all my papers this morning,

1218
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:27,609
so that I can have a meeting
with Ron this afternoon.

1219
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:30,045
Oh, you're gonna tell him.

1220
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:31,480
How's he gonna take it?

1221
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:32,881
The way I'm gonna tell him?

1222
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:35,350
Not well.

1223
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:38,353
Oh, my God, I should sell
tickets to this meeting.

1224
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:41,757
Daddy? Daddy?

1225
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:43,792
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

1226
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:46,661
I thought you left
without saying goodbye.

1227
01:02:46,663 --> 01:02:49,898
Oh, well, you were
sleeping, honey.

1228
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,666
I didn't want to wake you up.

1229
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:54,169
You always have to
say goodbye, Daddy.

1230
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:56,972
And give me my milk and
watch cartoons. Okay.

1231
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:59,407
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, I'm sorry.

1232
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:01,309
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1233
01:03:01,311 --> 01:03:03,879
I'll do it tomorrow,
okay? I promise.

1234
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,148
Okay.

1235
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:23,732
Oh, yeah, what, and what?
Yup.

1236
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:29,337
Okay, and how 'bout the headphones
for good measure, okay?

1237
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:31,439
Your lucky day.
I'm giving you a break.

1238
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:34,109
But you got two. Okay?
Thanks.

1239
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,879
For the smart-ass look
you just gave me.

1240
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:40,682
Yeah. Enjoy it. Okay?

1241
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,618
I don't... I don't need it.

1242
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:48,089
Listen, the whole Brian Campbell
situation is unfortunate.

1243
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:50,759
But, uh, I have nothing
to say about it.

1244
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:52,861
Well, you just
said it was unfortunate.

1245
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:55,964
Then I have nothing else to say
about it, okay, Mr. Grammar?

1246
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:58,300
We were hoping to talk
to Principal Douche about it.

1247
01:03:58,302 --> 01:04:02,037
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

1248
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:05,140
It's a brand new day.
They offered me my job back.

1249
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:06,408
I did not take it.

1250
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:09,077
I've been offered jobs at
other schools over the years

1251
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,712
and I stayed there

1252
01:04:10,714 --> 01:04:14,149
because I thought things were gonna change.
I thought Douche...

1253
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:16,818
Look, the douche will be the
douche for the rest of his life.

1254
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:18,453
He's gonna have to wake up,
look in the mirror,

1255
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:20,789
and see himself, and that's
enough punishment for me.

1256
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:24,392
I kind of hope
he wakes up with VD.

1257
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:26,962
Ah! That's
a little bad karma.

1258
01:04:26,964 --> 01:04:30,131
Not... Just the kind
that hurts when he pees.

1259
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,968
Burning.
Yes.

1260
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:36,171
"Who is the third president
of the United States?"

1261
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:38,673
Answer,
"Mr. Donovan's a homo."

1262
01:04:38,675 --> 01:04:42,143
It's not true, it's mean, it's
politically incorrect, and I just...

1263
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:44,246
These kids, I don't know what
to do with them, I mean,

1264
01:04:44,248 --> 01:04:46,214
I come in every day and
I do my best and they just

1265
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,850
yell and they don't listen and I
don't know how to control them.

1266
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:50,418
No, that's your first mistake.

1267
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,987
You're not gonna be
able to control them.

1268
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:54,723
They're very energetic, they're
gonna be all over the place.

1269
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:57,559
What you have to do is learn
to conserve that energy

1270
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:00,562
and try and redirect them in the
direction you want them to go in.

1271
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:02,297
What are you
guys talking about?

1272
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:04,566
Ian's just having a little
trouble in his history class.

1273
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,468
- A lot of trouble.
- History?

1274
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:08,703
Mmm-hmm.
Who cares about that?

1275
01:05:08,705 --> 01:05:12,007
I'm in the robot business,
and business is booming.

1276
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,444
What's the width
of a child's neck?

1277
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:22,417
Actually, business
is not booming.

1278
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:25,420
Season's off to a terrible start
and I'm not handling it well.

1279
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:26,655
You call this efficient torque?

1280
01:05:26,657 --> 01:05:28,089
Yeah.
Is that a joke?

1281
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,758
I have a joke for you.
Knock knock.

1282
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,793
Who's there?
Second place!

1283
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:33,161
Are you insane?

1284
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:34,729
Terrible! Start over!

1285
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:36,197
What do you have?
It's hyperbolic.

1286
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:37,933
Get under the table.
Get under the table.

1287
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:39,634
Slide over, slide over.

1288
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:41,937
What do you have
here? What is...

1289
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:46,841
Actually, that's pretty good. All right.
You keep up the good work.

1290
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:48,563
Oh, don't be such a crybaby.

1291
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:55,083
Yeah, Mitch won Teacher of the Year.
I've accepted that.

1292
01:05:55,085 --> 01:05:57,218
But I will tell you, it's
not just about teaching.

1293
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,854
Huh? He has a vest
on all the time.

1294
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,957
Who's the teacher in the vest?

1295
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:04,092
Teacher in the
vest, vest, vest.

1296
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:06,394
Kardashian. Jesse James.

1297
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:09,564
Jesus. Publicity
figures. Boom. Huh?

1298
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:12,701
Not me anymore. Next year,
whole new attitude.

1299
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:15,470
Oh, who's the guy
in the new glasses?

1300
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:18,873
Teacher of the Year.

1301
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,909
Honestly, she's
got nothing going on.

1302
01:06:22,913 --> 01:06:24,245
'Cause she's brain-dead.

1303
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:33,855
- Hey.
- Hey.

1304
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:38,760
Brought your lunch. Oh, how sweet,
Mitchie, Mommy brought you lunchie!

1305
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:43,465
Can I... Can we go to
your room for just a sec?

1306
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:45,233
- Yeah.
- Ooh!

1307
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:48,269
Shut up!

1308
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:56,578
Don't take it.

1309
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,813
If you think it's the
wrong move, don't take it.

1310
01:06:58,815 --> 01:07:02,117
No, no, no, I have to.
I have to.

1311
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:06,454
Yeah, I know I said
that, but...

1312
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:08,590
I was wrong.

1313
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:12,460
I... I don't want to
see you working so hard.

1314
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:14,629
You're killing yourself.

1315
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:16,831
But I don't mind it.
But I do.

1316
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,068
I do.

1317
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:26,346
I just want us to be together.

1318
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:29,511
We will be.

1319
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,547
We are.

1320
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:34,082
Always.

1321
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,254
Okay.
Okay.

1322
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:48,997
So, when will you
tell your students?

1323
01:07:48,999 --> 01:07:50,799
That I'm leaving?

1324
01:07:50,801 --> 01:07:53,334
Um, I don't know.

1325
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:58,039
I might not tell them at all.

1326
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,874
Isn't that
the coward's way out?

1327
01:07:59,876 --> 01:08:01,309
Absolutely.

1328
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:05,513
Yeah, but I'm just not sure that
I could handle the goodbye.

1329
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:08,483
You're quitting? Why?

1330
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:11,252
Well actually, Ron, I'm
quitting because of you.

1331
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:14,189
Me? Why? Have you
told other people?

1332
01:08:14,191 --> 01:08:17,158
No, of course not. Come on, relax,
I'm not quitting because of you.

1333
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,061
Oh, my God. God!

1334
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:21,362
Why would you say that?

1335
01:08:21,364 --> 01:08:23,131
Because I'm trying
to help you out.

1336
01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:25,700
I'm trying to help you understand
why the teachers don't respect you

1337
01:08:25,702 --> 01:08:27,469
and the kids don't like you.

1338
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:30,004
I don't know either of those
things to be true. Sure you are.

1339
01:08:30,006 --> 01:08:32,707
And I know it's killing you because
you're trying so hard to be liked.

1340
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:35,443
Yes, I try very hard. Yeah, I
know, and that's the problem.

1341
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:38,113
It's not your job to be
liked, it's your job to lead.

1342
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:40,181
Well, you know what,
I just think that maybe

1343
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:42,150
you and I have very different
ideas about how to do this job.

1344
01:08:42,152 --> 01:08:45,220
You remember when you invited the
entire faculty to your birthday party

1345
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:46,454
except for three teachers?

1346
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,089
I realized my mistake,

1347
01:08:48,091 --> 01:08:49,491
and I invited them
the next day.

1348
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:51,159
Do you remember
the meeting you called

1349
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:52,660
to draft a new mission
statement for the school,

1350
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:54,529
and you invited the
teachers, the parents,

1351
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:56,564
and the kids all into
the same room?

1352
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:59,100
That wasn't my meeting.
It was a zoo, Ron.

1353
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:01,102
I mean, the teachers were
fighting with each other,

1354
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:03,404
calling each other names in front
of the parents and the kids.

1355
01:09:03,406 --> 01:09:04,772
That was Rita's meeting.

1356
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:07,442
They are all your meetings!

1357
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:09,310
God! Can't you
just own it?

1358
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,513
Can't you just say,
"Yeah, I am responsible"?

1359
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:13,515
Aren't you tired of
being such a pussy?

1360
01:09:13,517 --> 01:09:14,782
You know what,
you win one award

1361
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:16,851
and you think you know everything, huh?
Is that it?

1362
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:19,487
I know what the students
of Truman think of me.

1363
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,456
Ron, the kids
think you're a dick.

1364
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:25,460
Okay.

1365
01:09:25,462 --> 01:09:26,861
We're finished here.

1366
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:28,763
Yeah, it's okay.

1367
01:09:28,765 --> 01:09:30,265
I was already done.

1368
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,568
Jesus Christ.

1369
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:36,471
That might be a little bit
more than he's used to, huh?

1370
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:39,040
You think?

1371
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,050
All right, guys, you had a
great week of practice.

1372
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:51,653
Just remember, we play
together, we win together.

1373
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:52,787
- Count off.
- One!

1374
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:56,324
Right, that's right, you play
as one, and we will win!

1375
01:09:56,326 --> 01:09:57,759
Hands up!

1376
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:59,060
- One, two, three.
- Titans!

1377
01:09:59,062 --> 01:10:01,763
Let's go, boys. Get out there.

1378
01:10:01,765 --> 01:10:03,464
<i>They'll win a game</i>
<i>at some point.</i>

1379
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:07,569
<i>Eh, probably not today, though.
Um, this team is pretty tough,</i>

1380
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:09,571
<i>but my guys are making</i>
<i>a lot of good decisions,</i>

1381
01:10:09,573 --> 01:10:11,839
<i>and they'll be rewarded</i>
<i>for that eventually.</i>

1382
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,742
Yeah, all right, Chris!

1383
01:10:14,744 --> 01:10:16,277
Nice stop, buddy, nice stop.

1384
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:21,382
<i>Teaching sometimes feels like you're
leading the kids through a dense fog.</i>

1385
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:23,785
<i>Uh, the worst part of this</i>
<i>job is the fear</i>

1386
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:26,020
<i>that you might not be taking
them in the right direction.</i>

1387
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:28,623
Come on, push it up,
push it up.

1388
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:32,527
<i>And then, suddenly, it's</i>
<i>nothing but clear skies.</i>

1389
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:03,658
So, when will you
tell your students?

1390
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,460
That I'm leaving?

1391
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:08,096
Um, I don't know.

1392
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:12,867
I might not tell them at all.

1393
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:14,535
Isn't that
the coward's way out?

1394
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:16,037
Absolutely.

1395
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:20,275
Yeah, but... I'm just not sure
that I could handle the goodbye.

1396
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:25,513
You know, uh, we've been
talking to them all week.

1397
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:29,217
The students?
What'd they say?

1398
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:31,586
He works harder than any
teacher I've ever seen.

1399
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:34,222
He's kept me after class
and said,

1400
01:11:34,224 --> 01:11:37,659
you know, like, "Don't act like I'm
forcing this knowledge on you."

1401
01:11:37,661 --> 01:11:40,962
You know, "I got something that belongs
to you, so you gotta take it."

1402
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:43,231
When he talks to you like
that, let me tell you,

1403
01:11:43,233 --> 01:11:45,600
that'll make your ass
pick up a book and study.

1404
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:47,403
He had a real
cool swag about him.

1405
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,738
Man, thank you for
your swag, Mr. Carter.

1406
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,607
<i>I told him I</i>
<i>wasn't a good writer.</i>

1407
01:11:52,609 --> 01:11:54,175
<i>He says we're all writers.</i>

1408
01:11:54,177 --> 01:11:56,344
<i>He doesn't just make</i>
<i>you a better writer.</i>

1409
01:11:56,346 --> 01:12:01,316
<i>For the longest time, I didn't know what
I wanted to do with my life, you know?</i>

1410
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,751
<i>But now, I do.</i>

1411
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:05,520
<i>I want to be a teacher.</i>

1412
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:06,654
<i>He's the best.</i>

1413
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:07,855
<i>The best.</i>

1414
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:09,424
<i>The best.</i>

1415
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,354
He's the best
teacher I ever had.

1416
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,935
Well, that means
a lot. Thank you.

1417
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:26,774
<i>My daddy helps kids</i>
<i>learn and get smarter.</i>

1418
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:29,944
<i>He helps them read and write</i>
<i>and have a better life.</i>

1419
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:33,381
My daddy is a teacher.

1420
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:46,627
We did the VFW.

1421
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:48,830
Yes, we did the VFW. Definitely
won't be going to that one again.

1422
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:50,465
We did, and we did a preschool.

1423
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:52,133
We did the preschool.
Those kids loved it.

1424
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:53,868
Yeah, they were into it.
They were into it.

1425
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:57,171
They. They were clapping and singing and...
Singin' right along.

1426
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,873
They didn't even know
the words either. No.

1427
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:00,708
And I think, sometimes when you
don't know the words, it...

1428
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:01,976
It's better.

1429
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:03,878
It frees you. Why do you
need to know words to songs?

1430
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,513
A lot of times,
words hold you back.

1431
01:13:05,515 --> 01:13:07,248
Okay, let's lose the smirk.

1432
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,651
Oh, and you're still gonna...
You're still gonna laugh.

1433
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:12,120
Okay, that's fine.

1434
01:13:12,122 --> 01:13:17,525
I will be treated fairly
and taken seriously.

1435
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:19,260
Okay?
So enjoy it.

1436
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:24,232
I'm not gonna write all
that out again, you know.

1437
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:26,534
Maintaining a strong
relationship with the parents,

1438
01:13:26,536 --> 01:13:28,603
well, that, that's another key.

1439
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:31,038
Nia, uh, would you
excuse us, please?

1440
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,074
Nia, please.
Okay.

1441
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:35,109
He's gonna use his
imagination on Mommy.

1442
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:39,847
I couldn't help notice you're
not wearing a wedding ring.

1443
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:41,149
That is true.

1444
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:43,785
Um, neither am I.

1445
01:13:43,787 --> 01:13:45,086
Look what we have in common.

1446
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,555
Oh, my God. Um...

1447
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:51,192
You gotta have a lot of
contacts, all over the place.

1448
01:13:51,194 --> 01:13:52,260
We got them everywhere.

1449
01:13:52,262 --> 01:13:53,561
And you don't just
have the contact,

1450
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:55,163
I mean, you have to hang
with these people.

1451
01:13:55,165 --> 01:13:56,697
You gotta get intimate
with these people.

1452
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:57,799
You literally have to...

1453
01:13:57,801 --> 01:14:00,001
Hang on a
second. Hello?

1454
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,506
Okay. All right.

1455
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,976
Who's that?
Didn't get in.

1456
01:14:08,978 --> 01:14:10,044
Great.

1457
01:14:10,046 --> 01:14:13,481
See, but that opens up a
slot for another kid.

1458
01:14:13,483 --> 01:14:14,582
So that's how we look at it.

1459
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:15,983
You gotta have a
positive attitude.

1460
01:14:15,985 --> 01:14:17,351
And then you
gotta have contacts.

1461
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,256
I don't know, but it
seems to me

1462
01:14:22,258 --> 01:14:24,892
that the trophy for Teacher
of the Year ought to go

1463
01:14:24,894 --> 01:14:27,228
to the teacher
with the most trophies.

1464
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:31,599
That's just math. But I don't teach
math, I just teach robotics.

1465
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:34,869
That's not gonna be important
in the future whatsoever.

1466
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:37,672
Whatever, just let the
baby have his bottle.

1467
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:39,941
You plagiarized this whole paper.
No, I didn't.

1468
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:42,343
Yes, you did, you cut and pasted the
entire thing from the Internet.

1469
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:44,479
No! See here, you
accidentally...

1470
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:46,747
So, you've been
teaching for 25 years.

1471
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:49,116
25 years.

1472
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:52,653
Wow.
Yeah.

1473
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:55,156
Wow.

1474
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,898
I don't know if that's in your frame.
Is that what it's called, frame?

1475
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,567
I don't know if it's in your frame
but there's some kids back there.

1476
01:15:06,569 --> 01:15:08,669
Ready and willing
and able to learn.

1477
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:12,507
So...

1478
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:14,509
Let's have a great day of
instruction, you guys, huh?

1479
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:15,776
Is that a knife, young man?

1480
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:17,845
What is that,
is that a pen? Okay.

1481
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:21,349
Truman's test scores are
the highest in the area,

1482
01:15:21,351 --> 01:15:24,118
and I... I take a lot
of pride in that.

1483
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,355
But besides myself, um,
you know, the teachers

1484
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:30,992
are also a big part
of the success here at Truman.

1485
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:35,029
Okay, you know what, I will
give you each $5

1486
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:37,431
if you'll just be quiet
for five minutes.

1487
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:41,235
That's a dollar a minute, that's
basically all I'm making today.

1488
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:45,072
I will give you today's salary if you
will, please, just listen to me.

1489
01:15:45,074 --> 01:15:48,042
Uh, it's two white women, so...
Oh, it is?

1490
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:50,077
Yeah. Oh, you didn't
tell me that.

1491
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:53,147
Well, it's okay, it doesn't...
Superfluous, really.

1492
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:55,416
And so, let's just...
You know,

1493
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:57,818
instead of introducing it, let's just
play the song. Sure. Here we go.

1494
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:01,022
So this is <i> Closer to Fine,</i>
and we are the Indigo Boys.

1495
01:16:01,024 --> 01:16:03,157
Indigo Dudes. Dudes, I
like that one better.

1496
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:05,026
Actually,
we should make a banner.

1497
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:10,665
As you know, I started the FIGHT
program on campus this year.

1498
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:14,302
Friendship.

1499
01:16:14,304 --> 01:16:16,837
Intelligence.

1500
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:18,639
Gratitude.

1501
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:20,608
Humility.

1502
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:22,476
And trust.

1503
01:16:22,478 --> 01:16:26,581
These posters were meant
to encourage the students.

1504
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:31,552
Whoever vandalized
these posters

1505
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:33,921
didn't think about
that for one second!

1506
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,394
Some of you guys
might be virgins.

1507
01:16:40,396 --> 01:16:42,463
It might be a little...
It's okay, guys, it's okay.

1508
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:45,132
Sexuality. That's where
you come into your own.

1509
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:49,203
I'll tell you where you're not
gonna find your sexuality out.

1510
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:50,805
North Dakota.
No.

1511
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:52,607
That's a black hole
of sexuality.

1512
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:54,642
I mean, nobody finds
anything up there.

1513
01:16:54,644 --> 01:16:56,611
I'm Asian, but I wear
colored contacts

1514
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:58,512
to make my eyes blue.

1515
01:16:58,514 --> 01:17:01,382
They say that's exactly what
they're looking for at USC!

1516
01:17:01,384 --> 01:17:04,118
We were teaching
that girl a lesson. Okay?

1517
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,587
You sometimes have to be
fake to make it in LA.

1518
01:17:06,589 --> 01:17:08,422
USC, it's full of phonies.

1519
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:09,924
Period. We said it.
Right?

1520
01:17:09,926 --> 01:17:11,859
You want to fit in,
you be a phony.

1521
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:14,161
And by the way, I would
say that to USC's face.

1522
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:16,797
You're a phony, USC.
If they had a face.

1523
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:19,567
If USC had a face... I'll
say it to George Lucas.

1524
01:17:19,569 --> 01:17:21,669
You're a phony.

1525
01:17:21,671 --> 01:17:23,404
Yeah, no. I know Mitch
won Teacher of the Year

1526
01:17:23,406 --> 01:17:24,572
and I'm okay with it now,
I've accepted it.

1527
01:17:24,574 --> 01:17:26,741
He's plays the rube in
from the farm, right?

1528
01:17:26,743 --> 01:17:30,645
I'm the guy in the vest. Oh!
Scarecrow. Not buying it.

1529
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:32,480
You know what it is?
It's branding.

1530
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:34,949
That's what he's done.
It's like a sex tape.

1531
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:36,183
In the guise of a vest.

1532
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:37,585
No. No!

1533
01:17:37,587 --> 01:17:40,621
I want you to know that you
may think this is funny,

1534
01:17:40,623 --> 01:17:44,058
but this is not some
kind of joke, okay?

1535
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,961
And if I ever find
out where this

1536
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:51,198
fight and drug club is meeting,

1537
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,801
I will ruin you!

1538
01:17:53,803 --> 01:17:56,003
Soft sticks,
lightly on the slap.

1539
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,972
Right in front of... You guys
have the clickers and everything.

1540
01:17:57,974 --> 01:17:59,440
Hold up, man.

1541
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:01,876
That's terrific.

1542
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:03,911
We're gonna
brighten this up here.

1543
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:06,280
There we go.

1544
01:18:06,282 --> 01:18:07,581
It's brightening it up!

1545
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:08,783
Brightening it up.
Interesting.

1546
01:18:08,785 --> 01:18:11,052
I didn't know that
you could do that. Wow.

1547
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,455
Do you call this efficient torque?
Yeah.

1548
01:18:14,457 --> 01:18:16,738
Okay, I have a joke for you then.
Uh, knock knock.

1549
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,259
Knock knock?

1550
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:20,394
Knock knock.
Knock knock?

1551
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:21,495
Go back to the top.

1552
01:18:21,497 --> 01:18:23,564
I was gonna play it out,

1553
01:18:23,566 --> 01:18:25,099
'cause it's
almost even funnier.

1554
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:28,302
- You all right?
- Sorry. Almond.

1555
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:30,671
Nevada. Nevada. Stay
away from Nevada.

1556
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:32,506
You can go.

1557
01:18:32,508 --> 01:18:34,109
But you're gonna kill a hooker.

1558
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:41,382
Pause, pause, pause.

1559
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:46,520
Ooh!

1560
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:49,990
Okay, we rolling?

1561
01:18:52,328 --> 01:18:55,196
Yeah, you learned a chord. I'm
gonna just play this chord.

1562
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:56,363
Yeah.
Over and over.

1563
01:18:56,365 --> 01:19:00,000
Trust me, that's how Poison got
a career, so don't sweat it.

1564
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:02,036
My balls are itchy.

1565
01:19:02,038 --> 01:19:03,804
Slow down so I can
hear the word "balls."

1566
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:05,673
My balls are itchy.

1567
01:19:05,675 --> 01:19:07,875
My balls are itchy.

1568
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:10,678
Think about it.

1569
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:11,979
Look, you wanna act?
Mmm-hmm.

1570
01:19:11,981 --> 01:19:15,182
Act itchy balls. Act like
you got itchy balls.

1571
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:17,752
Make 'em itch.

1572
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:20,321
My balls are itchy.

1573
01:19:20,323 --> 01:19:22,790
If I was telling you my balls
itch, I would tell you...

1574
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:25,459
This is how I would say
it, "My balls are itchy."

1575
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:27,161
My balls are itchy.

1576
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:37,304
All right, Arno,
here we go, buddy.

1577
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:38,572
- You got this.
- Rolling.

1578
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:40,341
Scene 100, take 4, marker.

1579
01:19:40,343 --> 01:19:43,477
Boom!
