114
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,402  X1:360 X2:647 Y1:350 Y2:444
Why today? Why did you
have to pick today
to destroy the house?

115
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,446  X1:364 X2:647 Y1:382 Y2:444
You know
what's happening today.

116
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,448  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:414 Y2:441
I tried to tell him, Mom.

117
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,950  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:382 Y2:444
"Mom's throwing
a very important party," I said.

118
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,953  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:382 Y2:438
"All ofher important
clients will be here."

119
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,787  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:350 Y2:444
But he went right ahead
and wrecked the house
and let Nevins get away.

120
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,452  X1:322 X2:647 Y1:382 Y2:444
Now, again, I hope
you're going to ground him.

121
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,291  X1:070 X2:399 Y1:382 Y2:444
Yes, Sally, for a week, but
that's none of your business.

122

123
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,765  X1:071 X2:371 Y1:382 Y2:444
I asked you to do
one thing today, Conrad...

124
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,768  X1:469 X2:648 Y1:382 Y2:438

clean.

125
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:55,772  X1:262 X2:647 Y1:350 Y2:444
Do you know how frustrating it is
that you're always doing
the exact opposite of what I say?
