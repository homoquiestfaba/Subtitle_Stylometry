1
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,866
Meet Mitchell Parker.

2
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,100
This is his story. 
It's a true story.

3
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,366
And if it weren't for the fact 
that it actually happened,

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,033
you probably wouldn't 
believe it.

5
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:30,566
[up-tempo music]

6
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:45,400
Mitch grew up an ordinary kid,

7
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:48,666
from an ordinary family

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,800
in the ordinary town of 
Sardis, Ohio.

9
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:00,566
Which was unfortunate

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,633
because this kid wanted nothing 
to do with ordinary.

11
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:14,533
So, he developed his 
imagination.

12
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:16,700
Now all kids had a fantasy.

13
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:19,100
But by the time Mitch 
got to college,

14
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:22,433
his parents from Sardis, 
Ohio had become royalty,

15
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:25,933
who escaped with their lives 
from Bulgaria or Romania

16
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:29,166
or some place.

17
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,466
Mitch was perfecting the 
art of the lie.

18
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,666
He was an artist.

19
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,533
So where does a fellow with a 
God-given talent

20
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:43,233
for stretching the truth go to 
find gainful employment?

21
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:46,233
In Washington, Mitch became a 
lowly researcher

22
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:48,566
for an influential congressman.

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,233
But he never missed an 
opportunity

24
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,366
to have his picture taken.

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,233
He was building his 
wall of fame.

26
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:58,433
But more on that later.

27
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:02,033
Hollywood, the land of make 
believe called to Mitch.

28
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:04,666
and with nothing but a few 
thousand dollars

29
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,933
and a box of photos 
under his arm,

30
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:11,033
he burst on to the California 
political scene as a lobbyist,

31
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,933
in the fall of 1978.

32
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,500
Gentlemen.

33
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:26,333
This was the wall of fame.

34
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:31,066
And it was impressive.
Extremely impressive.

35
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,466
He'd met a few of these people,
most were casual encounters.

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,966
But the rest of the photos were
just plain fakes.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,033
But even a top lobyist

38
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,733
doesn't make the kind of dough
that Mitch was spending.

39
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:47,900
[drums beating]

40
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,266
And some people wondered

41
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:58,933
if perhaps Mitch was 
independently wealthy.

42
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:01,566
The perks of political power
were plentiful.

43
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,066
It realized at least one of his
childhood dreams.

44
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,666
He'd gotten the girl

45
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,200
and her friend

46
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,966
and her friend's sister.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,200
But spending more than three 
nights with any woman

48
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,266
made Mitch nervous.

49
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,933
Until...

50
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:26,866
Excuse me.

51
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,900
Now this woman was different.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,300
She was a successful business
person in her own right.

53
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,400
She had two children from a
previous marriage.

54
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:37,700
And most importantly,
she would be busy.

55
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:43,066
She would leave Mitch
to his own devices.

56
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,200
So, you're a lawyer?

57
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:48,533
My business represents clients,
who have

58
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:52,633
difficulty assessing certain
lines of communication

59
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:57,600
-necessary for their success.
-Ah.

60
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:00,266
I have no idea
what you just said,

61
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,233
but you're obviously
overpaid for it.

62
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,766
I'm a consultant.

63
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,700
-[waves crashing]
-[seagulls squawking]

64
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:13,200
Did anyone ever tell you, you
have the most amazing eyes?

65
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:17,800
Did anyone ever tell you that
you have the most amazing eyes?

66
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,900
Yeah.

67
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,566
-Who?
-You just did.

68
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,766
[laughs in embarrassment]

69
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,400
What's that?

70
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:35,400
[kissing sounds]

71
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:46,966
In August of 1985, Mitch Parker 
married Candace Law

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,466
in Las Vegas, Nevada.

73
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,933
And they settled into his 
comfortable house in Malibu

74
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:56,266
with Candy's two children.

75
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,466
Dennis: Ice.

76
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,900
-Mitch: I'll be late.
-Candy: Oh, sweetie. Okay.

77
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:05,566
But Mitch was very careful to 
keep his personal life and his

78
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,466
political life separate.
[woman panting]

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,866
Incredibly, Candy never knew 
where Mitch worked.

80
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,366
and could only reach him through 
a message service.

81
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,600
But, as it turned out, Candy 
wasn't busy enough.

82
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,066
I'll do some buying
for the shop.

83
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,533
I can visit Susan. I'll take her
to the theater and museums--

84
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:26,266
I'll take you to New York.
I'll show you New York City

85
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,900
like you've never seen that
city before.

86
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:30,800
Mitch: But right now I can't
afford the distraction, please.

87
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:36,333
Oh. All right. I wouldn't want
to be a distraction.

88
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:40,166
Candy, this is a mega,
mega deal.

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,800
Yeah, of course it is.
They're all mega deals.

90
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,633
I never see you anymore.
[slams door]

91
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,100
Mitch knew he had a problem that 
wasn't going to go away.

92
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,966
-Candy. Come on honey.
- He had to move her 
out of town,

93
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:55,500
which wasn't easy because she 
was devoted to her business,

94
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:59,833
which was also thriving.

95
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:02,033
This was a tough one.

96
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:05,100
Candy: Wait a second. Let me
just finish December.

97
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:09,133
[whispering] Honey, I need to
talk to you right now, please.

98
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,500
-What is it? You're scaring me.
-Come and sit down.

99
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:23,000
Candy: What, honey? Tell me.

100
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:26,566
I wanted to tell you for a long
time, believe me.

101
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,300
-But they wouldn't le me.
-Who wouldn't?

102
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:34,866
-The government.
-What are you talking about?

103
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:42,266
I'm an operative, Candy.
I work for the CIA.

104
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,800
The CIA?

105
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,233
Mitch: Yes, I have
for about five years.

106
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:51,533
-What?
-Mitch: I know this
must be hard.

107
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:56,766
-Why didn't you tell me?
-My job is known as deep cover.

108
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,366
Nobody, nobody knew.

109
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,033
Why are you telling me now?

110
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:08,366
Because an agent's body was
found outside of Paris

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,933
and they're afraid I may
have been compromised

112
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:15,600
and they're moving us
to Florida, on Thursday.

113
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:19,300
-[stutters] To Florida?
-Mitch: Yes.

114
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,533
And I have to go to Nicaragua.

115
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,133
You'll have to make the move on
your own. I'm so sorry.

116
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:28,700
[sighs] Mitch, what uh...the
kids' school and my business.

117
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:33,533
I know. I tried. They just...
They won't let us stay.

118
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:36,800
Mitch: You see that's why I
couldn't take you to my office.

119
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,766
Because I didn't have one. That
is why I'm always travelling.

120
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,866
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,233
[whispers] My God, Mitch.
Are you in danger?

122
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:53,366
-Yes.
-[Candy sighs]

123
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,866
-Mitch: I'm sorry.
- So,

124
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,366
while Candice packed up the 
family and sold her business,

125
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,633
Mitch was off on his dangerous 
mission in Nicaragua.

126
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,900
Finally after four weeks, the
phone rings, the Pope answers.

127
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:12,233
Sister Theresa says, "Hey JP,
it's Terry. I'm in L.A."

128
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:15,533
[laughs]

129
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:18,300
Hey Mitch, can I talk to you?
Excuse me.

130
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,766
Man: Terrific.
Woman: Did you get it?

131
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,633
-Having a good time, Senator?
-Yeah.

132
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:32,033
Until daddy takes
the T-Bird away.

133
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:35,366
[sighs] How'd it go with CLC?

134
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,200
They're wondering when
to expect to reach the floor.

135
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:41,133
-I'd say within a month.
-Excellent.

136
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,733
That's what I told them.

137
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:47,766
[envelope rustles]

138
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,500
Senator, what's your position on
the Eggleton forestry bill?

139
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,733
[laughter in background]

140
00:08:55,766 --> 00:09:00,466
-Mitch: That's what I told them.
-[laughs]

141
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,833
This is the living room.

142
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:07,266
-It's small, but really cute.
-Mitch: Nice, beautiful.

143
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,566
What do you think of
those drapes?

144
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,100
The drapes? Uh, nice.
I like them.

145
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,733
Mitch! They're absolutely
hideous.

146
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:16,900
Mitch: Oh, I thought you
bought them.

147
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,800
No, I got shutters. They're
won-- Wow, you have no taste.

148
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,600
-You're sleeping in your car.
-No, I hate them.

149
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,266
Oh, it's such a relief.
Bedrooms are over there.

150
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,600
That's for later. This is the
dining room.

151
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,133
This is a new dining set
and you like it.

152
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,100
-Do I like it?
-You love it, actually.

153
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:33,166
-I love it!
-That's wonderful.

154
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,066
Kids. Come on, honey.

155
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,533
-Look who's here?!
-Boy: Daddy!

156
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:37,933
Boy: Daddy, watch this!

157
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,733
-[water splashes]
-[both cheer] That's great.

158
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:43,833
Samantha, come on give daddy a
hug. Come on. How are you?

159
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:47,300
-How was Nicaragua?
-Oh, it was tough. Pretty bad.

160
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,733
I'm so glad they let you home.

161
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:53,000
And Mitch juggled his married 
life in Florida...

162
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:57,133
-Boy: Throw. Okay, give it here.
-[Mitch and the boys screech]

163
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,866
and his single life in 
Los Angeles

164
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,433
successfully for the 
next five years.

165
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:02,733
Man: Thank you, very much.
Mitch: Thank you.

166
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:05,033
You're not going out dressed
like that, because I said so.

167
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,700
Now go and change, right now!

168
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,633
Don't you have a secret mission
to go on?

169
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,700
Samantha knock it off!
Do not talk to Mitch like--

170
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:15,066
-You always take his side.
-[angrily] I side...

171
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,566
-[TV in background]
-[door slams]

172
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,366
Well teenagers! They say they
become human again eventually.

173
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,900
-I'm sorry.
-That's all right.

174
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:31,133
-What time do you leave?
-Early.

175
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,400
It's Kuwait, isn't it?

176
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,800
-Honey!
-Mitch, please!

177
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:40,466
There's going to be a war. And I
have a right to know.

178
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,266
Yes, it's Kuwait.

179
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,400
Be careful.

180
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,366
But Mitch was like a juggler, 
who had six balls in the air

181
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,066
and couldn't resist trying to 
make it eight.

182
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,366
-Excuse me, you're in my seat.
-Sorry.

183
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,633
I don't like to sit
next to the window.

184
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,633
Too close to the action for me.

185
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,533
Even if the flaps don't flap,
you don't wanna know about it?

186
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,333
Don't even make a joke.

187
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:11,933
-[loud thud]
-[groans nervously]

188
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,866
I think they just closed the
cargo door.

189
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,100
But if you want to dig your
nails in my arm, you're welcome.

190
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,300
[sighs] I'm sorry.

191
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,166
[woman heaves]

192
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,733
[passengers chatter]

193
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:31,466
You know there isn't really that
much danger.

194
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,633
Not until we get in the air.

195
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:40,966
[music playing on headphones]

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,066
Mitch: It was bizarre. My mother 
and father went to theater.

197
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,400
- She thought he was asleep.
-[Liz laughs lightly]

198
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:55,633
He was 58 years old, a beautiful
man. Incredible. So kind.

199
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,900
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:03,733
Anyway, I found myself heir to
a ridiculous amount of money.

201
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:06,933
I also was getting
worse and worse.

202
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:12,166
Finally, I went to a doctor.
And then, another and

203
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,366
they told me it wasn't
an ulcer at all. It was

204
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,133
-pancreatic cancer.
-Oh, my God!

205
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,866
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,700
They gave me a year to live, two
on the outside. I went nuts and

207
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:31,166
just started spending money
like crazy. Buying things.

208
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,600
Buying all sorts of things.

209
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:35,833
It's amazing the toys you can
buy with the right frame of mind

210
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:37,600
-with a few million dollars.
-Yes, I know.

211
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,233
My company sells
some of those toys.

212
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:42,566
I'm not proud of everything
I did, but

213
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,533
I was able to put a few million
dollars away for my children.

214
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:51,133
-You have kids?
-No.

215
00:12:51,166 --> 00:13:00,033
No, I'm not even married. Not
yet. But I hope to, some day.

216
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:04,900
Are you doing any chemotherapy
or radiation or anything?

217
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:10,166
Nothing. There's not a speck of
cancer left in my body.

218
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,166
What!

219
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,833
They call it spontaneous
remission. I call it a miracle.

220
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:16,500
[huffs out a breath]

221
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,700
Sorry. I get emotional when I
talk about it.

222
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,466
That's all right.
Really, that's...

223
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,666
-Thank you.
-That's...

224
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,800
I'm running so late.

225
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,633
This Brazilian designer is going
on and on in Portuguese.

226
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,800
I'm sorry, I don't speak
Portuguese. Did he call?

227
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,933
No, did you notice the
rainforest in our kitchen?

228
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:40,366
What?

229
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,000
If Cal sent me flowers
like that,

230
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,366
I'd think he was
cheating on me.

231
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,800
What're you talking about?

232
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:53,400
-Oh, good grief!
-I like this guy, Lizzie.

233
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,533
It's just dinner.

234
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:59,433
Well if you don't marry him,
give him my number.

235
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:03,100
Liz: So, tell me what're you
doing tonight?

236
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,800
Cal's taking me to a
Hockey game.

237
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:10,233
Liz: Whoo.

238
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,833
Ho, ho, ho.
You're wearing the DK?

239
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:17,300
-This is not just dinner.
-This is dinner and the opera.

240
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,433
Don't look at me like that.

241
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:19,866
[sighs] We were going
to the opera,

242
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,133
but I opted for beer and
dogs at the King's game instead.

243
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,133
[whispers] Bye.

244
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,700
-Roommate: I won't wait up.
-Liz: Don't.

245
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:37,000
Mitch found himself 
obsessed with the woman 
from the airplane.

246
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:42,333
Maybe it was her spirit. 
Perhaps it was her perfume.

247
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:43,800
But over the next six weeks,

248
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:48,466
he pursued Lizzie Wells with 
relentless determination.

249
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,533
Liz: [laughs] Stop.
Quit fooling around.

250
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,566
-[Mitch making funny sounds]
-Liz: Quit clowning around.

251
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,466
Give me that. So if you could be
any actor in the circus,

252
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,533
-what would you be?
-Uh, trapeze artist.

253
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,833
-Why?
-You're high above everyone

254
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,166
and you're flying through the
air and you let go,

255
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,200
and you're spinning and everyone
wonders, "Will they make it?"

256
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,366
-What about you?
-Elephant.

257
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,500
Elephant?

258
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,166
I would never have to worry
about my weight ever again.

259
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,333
[both laugh]

260
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,533
You know you're becoming
a problem.

261
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:30,000
-Oh.
-I'm falling in love with you.

262
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:33,366
And that's a problem?

263
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:40,433
-[kissing]
-[Liz moaning]

264
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:46,700
[Lizzie exhales]
That was so nice.

265
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,533
-What's that?
-What?

266
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:57,866
Something sharp
under the pillow.

267
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,366
-What? What's that?
-[whispers] Oh, my God!

268
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,566
-I think that's yours.
-[Liz exclaims]

269
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,266
Oh, it's beautiful.

270
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,633
Oh Mitch, it's so beautiful.

271
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,233
Now, you might be saying,

272
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:16,133
"Hold on. Isn't he already 
married to Candy?"

273
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:20,400
That's right. 
And happily, too.

274
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:24,666
But any ordinary guy 
can have one wife.

275
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:30,866
Anchorman: Now, a further 
report from Kuwait City,

276
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,666
by our correspondent 
Michael McMillan.

277
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,533
McMillan: With rotors spinning, 
set against a clear blue sky,

278
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:38,866
the winds have kept....

279
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,900
Mitch? Oh my God! Kids!
I think I saw your daddy on TV.

280
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:49,033
[shouts] Get in here, quick.
I think I saw dad on TV.

281
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:51,466
Pastor: If there are any here
who can show a just cause

282
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,966
why these two should not be
joined in holy matrimony--

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,533
Where? I don't see him.

284
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,933
He was coming out of a
building. Maybe they'll go back.

285
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:01,633
I don't think so, mom.

286
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,733
By the power invested in me by
the state of Nevada--

287
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:07,366
Go back. Go back.

288
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,500
Pastor: I now pronounce you
man and wife.

289
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:16,000
[crying] Mitch. Oh baby, where
are you?

290
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,966
You may kiss the bride.

291
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,833
Mitch, oh!

292
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,900
Oh, baby. I'm so glad
you're okay.

293
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:39,166
-Hey, I saw you.
-You did? Where?

294
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,966
I saw you on TV, on CNN.

295
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,933
In Kuwait. You were coming out
of some building,

296
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:46,000
like a bunker or something?

297
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:47,766
Honey, was that you?

298
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,566
Candy, I told you, you must
never ask me these questions.

299
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,033
I can't talk about these things.

300
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:58,000
-Yes, it was.
-[laughs] I knew it.

301
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,766
[shouts] Hey kids!
Look who's home.

302
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,366
Mitch: Hey!

303
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,366
-What are we in?
-Man: Clubs.

304
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,533
Clubs. Well, lay 'em down.

305
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:17,800
That's it for me.

306
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,733
-Here you go. Good luck.
-[all sigh]

307
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,433
-Woman: That's it?
-That's it.

308
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:24,866
Go for the big slam. I'm gonna
go get some fresh air.

309
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,366
Okay, diamonds are my favorite,
but I don't have any.

310
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,633
Candy! Aw! I love--

311
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,800
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Been tied up in meetings.

312
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,300
I miss you so much.

313
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,833
-Liz: When are you coming?
-Tomorrow, I hope.

314
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:41,400
-Liz: Is it very cold there?
-Cold?

315
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:43,100
It's a blizzard. I'm in the
middle of a blizzard here.

316
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,800
It's twelve below zero with the
windchill factor. It's terrible.

317
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,533
-Liz: It's what?
-It's twelve below zero here.

318
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,866
-It's freezing.
-Liz: It's a bad connection.

319
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,166
Terrible static. 
l will call you right ba--

320
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,533
No, no. Hold on.

321
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,833
-Liz: What's the number 
of the hotel?
-No, eh--

322
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:59,966
Somebody's at the door. Hold on
a sec. [loudly] Yeah come on in.

323
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,966
Hold on. [loudly] Yeah, put it
on the table right there.

324
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,233
Wait a second. Where's the
sandwich? I ordered a sandwich.

325
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:11,800
Honey can I call you back?
I'll call you right back. Bye.

326
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:34,766
Um, yeah. I don't know.

327
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,333
[laughs]

328
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:44,700
Samantha: Can I call you back.
Yeah, okay.

329
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:48,200
What?

330
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:51,033
You don't like me, do you?

331
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,866
Yeah, sure I do.

332
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,533
You don't have to like me.

333
00:19:57,566 --> 00:20:02,666
You just have
to respect my privacy.

334
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,266
[whispers] Respect my privacy
and I'll respect yours.

335
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,066
I've no idea what
you're talking about.

336
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,466
I think you do.

337
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,266
Do you understand?

338
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,966
[speaks slowly] Do you
understand?

339
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,900
Yes.

340
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:28,966
Thank you, Samantha.

341
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,700
-Hi.
-Hi.

342
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:49,500
-What's wrong?
-I just called in.

343
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:52,633
-Oh, don't tell me. When?
-Tomorrow.

344
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:57,133
Mitch, don't they know
you just got home?

345
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:01,766
Yes, they do know.
They don't care.

346
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,633
Sorry. I don't know how much
more of this I can take myself.

347
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:22,533
-What are you up to?
-[Candy laughs]

348
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:25,966
I've only got you
for nine more hours.

349
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,433
I'm making the most of them.

350
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:32,733
Mitch was on top of the world.

351
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:36,066
A fantastic world 
of his own creation.

352
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,500
What could possibly go wrong?

353
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:41,933
I'm being indicted in the
morning.

354
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:44,666
I don't know how
wide it will be.

355
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,900
Obviously they're gonna
talk to you.

356
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:50,233
Well, you've got nothing to
worry about, Bob.

357
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:51,500
Bob: Good.

358
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:55,033
[takes a deep breath]

359
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:57,366
Do I?

360
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,500
Bob, do I have anything
to worry about?

361
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,533
I'll do what I can.

362
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:12,066
If someone were to give me up,
[laughs]

363
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,100
I think that would be
unfortunate for a lot of people.

364
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:19,400
I know it would. I know, Mitch.

365
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:23,533
Because I just happen
to know a lot.

366
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:29,933
A lot more than the FBI could
possibly dream of knowing.

367
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:35,500
-Are you threatening me, Mitch?
-Mitch: No.

368
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:39,700
Everything will be fine, Bob.

369
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,500
But with the Senator Belding 
pipeline cut off,

370
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:45,600
Mitch had a serious 
cash-flow problem.

371
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,300
First stop, Phil Dubrowski,

372
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,200
president of the West Valley 
Chamber of Commerce.

373
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,466
Tell me what's the problem?

374
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,833
I'm dying. It's my heart.

375
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:59,766
Oh, Mitch.

376
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,100
-There's nothing they can do?
-Mitch: No, they've ruled out

377
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,566
transplant. They're treating me
with drugs right now.

378
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,666
They say my only chance is a
procedure called

379
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,966
Percutaneous Valvuloplasty.

380
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,833
[laughs] But it's experimental,
so the insurance company

381
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:27,966
-won't pay for it.
-Do you need some help?

382
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,033
How much?

383
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:35,766
Ten thousand.

384
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,900
Ten thousand.

385
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:52,133
Mitch: If by chance those checks
don't come on time,

386
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:56,000
I've got some paintings in my
office. They're worth a lot.

387
00:23:56,033 --> 00:24:00,333
Or I could make you beneficiary
on one of my insurance policies.

388
00:24:00,366 --> 00:24:02,800
I don't need your insurance,
Mitch.

389
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:09,666
By the end of the day,

390
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,000
Mitch had raised 
over $50,000,

391
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:16,266
including twenty for a 
children's hospital wing

392
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,766
that he had absolutely 
nothing to do with.

393
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Mitch: "And thank you
for your time. Sincerely..."

394
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,033
Did Congressman Rijos' office
call?

395
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,366
No.

396
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,800
-Why isn't he returning my call?
-I don't know.

397
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:34,800
Is this a bad time to tell you
that my check bounced again?

398
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,700
-Mitch: It did?
-[telephone rings]

399
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:39,866
Just put it through again. I
swear, I'm gonna change banks.

400
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,833
Tha bank is lousy.

401
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:45,633
Secretary: Mitch Parker
Associates. Hold please.

402
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:50,866
-Are you in for Phil Dubrowski?
-No. Tell him at the clinic.

403
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,566
-What clinic?
-Heart.

404
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:03,400
[people chattering]

405
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:05,333
Mitch: Excuse me everyone.

406
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:09,933
May I have your attention for a
moment, please?

407
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,800
Recently, I took a leap

408
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,300
that I'm sure most
of you thought

409
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,000
I would never
have the courage to take.

410
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:17,866
[guests laughing politely]

411
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,900
I would like to introduce you
to someone.

412
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:25,266
My soul mate and
my new bride, Liz Parker.

413
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,566
[guests cheer and applaud]

414
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,833
-Guests: Congratulations!
-[whistle and cheer]

415
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:38,900
-Mrs. Parker?
-Should I eat one of these?

416
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:40,500
-It's quite good.
-No.

417
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:43,366
Phil Dubrowski.
Congratulations.

418
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,666
Thank you.
It's nice to meet you, Phil.

419
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,433
-Mitch is really looking good.
-Hmm. Isn't he?

420
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,866
I mean, considering
what he's been through.

421
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,266
I know. The stress would kill
most people, but Mitch,

422
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,666
he seems to thrive on it.

423
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,666
-Liz: Hey Jenny, how are you?
-Jenny: Fine.

424
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,466
Excuse me.

425
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,300
Thank you, Eric. Talk to you
Monday, okay?

426
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:08,566
Senator, good to see you.

427
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
You fellas know
my good friend Mitch?

428
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:16,566
This man is very good. He can
make things happen.

429
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,166
Only thing he's not good at is
returning phone calls.

430
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,400
[Mitch laughs nervously]

431
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:23,633
Why didn't you return my calls?
We've got history. We go back.

432
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:28,700
Yeah, can I talk to you for a
second? Would you excuse us?

433
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:31,766
I don't think it's such a good
idea that you're here today.

434
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,900
I came along to celebrate all
your good fortune.

435
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:38,966
-You got hitched. I got ditched.
-Well, you don't understand.

436
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,833
I'm telling you to leave.

437
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:46,633
Your turn will come.

438
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:49,500
Bruce, the Senator is ready to
go home now.

439
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:52,066
Thank you. Good to see you.

440
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,600
-Phil!
-Terrific party.

441
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:56,466
-Thanks for coming.
-How're you feeling, Mitch?

442
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,733
I feel great. It's a miracle.

443
00:27:01,766 --> 00:27:03,766
[whispers] It's a
tiny little scar...

444
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,833
[shouts] Pete,
I'll be right there.

445
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:07,200
[whispers] It's a
tiny little scar

446
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,966
and everything's wonderful. I'll
tell you all about it, okay?

447
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,100
Thanks. Good to see you.

448
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:19,800
Mitch's financial situation was 
bad and getting worse.

449
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,266
Maintaining two families on 
opposite coasts

450
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,633
was becoming impossible.

451
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:26,466
And bringing Candy back to L.A. 
was out of the question.

452
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,166
-Dennis: Dad, look at me
-That's good, Dennis.

453
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,966
But then,

454
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,933
a lucky coincidence 
presented itself.

455
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:42,066
And Mitch's fertile imagination
was ignited.

456
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,366
[electric shaver buzzes]

457
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,633
If you can't bring Mohammed
to the mountain,

458
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:53,100
you gonna have to bring
the mountain to Mohammed.

459
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:12,566
Yeah. No, no.

460
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,500
First of all Sidney, I have to
say it's a very generous offer.

461
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:19,033
No. It's not the money at all.

462
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:22,466
[laughs] You're not making this
very easy for me.

463
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,100
No, I couldn't ask Liz
to do that.

464
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:30,233
Yeah. We have a very
happy life here.

465
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:33,566
Yeah. No, Sid.
I'll tell you what.

466
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,733
Why don't you tell them
that I thought

467
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:38,366
it was a very generous
offer and I appreciate it.

468
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,566
Okay?
All right. Thank you.

469
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,400
-How was work?
-Good. What was that?

470
00:28:49,433 --> 00:28:51,466
Nothing. Just business.

471
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,066
-So, what couldn't you ask me?
-Nothing.

472
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,333
Okay, fine. Don't tell me.

473
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:06,666
Liz.

474
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,300
That was Sid Gold, from Disney.
He wanted to talk, 'cause

475
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,233
I did a little business for his
studio a couple of weeks ago

476
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:15,033
and it turned out very well.

477
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:17,833
And so, I took a meeting with
them and they offered me a job.

478
00:29:17,866 --> 00:29:21,500
-I just turned it down.
-What kind of a job?

479
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:24,366
Director of expansion,
as on new projects.

480
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,766
Why would you even
take the job interview?

481
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,866
I thought you were positioning
yourself to run for office.

482
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,400
To tell you the truth,

483
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:35,966
my secret dream has
always been to make movies.

484
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,833
And I think I was just indulging
my fantasy.

485
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:44,033
It's over. Sorry.

486
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:45,400
Mitch.

487
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:48,866
Liz, the job isn't even here.
It's in Orlando, Florida.

488
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,300
Orlando, Florida. I don't know
what got into me.

489
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:56,300
I'll be fine. [sighs loudly]

490
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,433
[Mitch laughs]

491
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:04,466
[whispers] Florida.

492
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:14,233
Mitch. I don't believe you.

493
00:30:14,266 --> 00:30:16,566
How can you turn down an
opportunity like this

494
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,000
without even talking
to me first?

495
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:21,500
If I had a chance to fulfill one
of my dreams,

496
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:26,033
-wouldn't you have helped?
-What about your job?

497
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:31,733
I'll get another job.
I'm a qualified individual.

498
00:30:31,766 --> 00:30:33,400
Besides,

499
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:36,533
I am gonna be wanting little
Parkers running around soon.

500
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:41,666
My parents are there.
They'll turn babysitters.

501
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,733
-You're unbelievable.
-Hmm.

502
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:49,700
Should I call?

503
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:51,066
Yeah.

504
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:00,666
Sid Gold, please.
Mitch Parker.

505
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,166
Automated Time: At the tone, the 
time will be six forty

506
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,300
and thirty seconds.

507
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,866
-Sid, Mitch. Yeah.
-[time information playing]

508
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,600
You're not gonna
believe this. Yup.

509
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:26,466
-Nervous?
-No,

510
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,033
-Your hand is sweating.
-Well, that's--

511
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:33,300
-So, you are nervous.
-I just want them to like me.

512
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,266
-Liz's mom: Liz?
-Liz: Mom.

513
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,933
-Liz's mom: Liz!
-Liz: Mom!

514
00:31:37,966 --> 00:31:41,700
Somewhere I went over land
some ship to the Panama Canal.

515
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,666
It all depended on the state of
the market.

516
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,466
-Liz: Dad travels a lot.
-Mitch: Really? Where?

517
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,366
South America, South Africa,
Middle East.

518
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Africa! Beautiful.
I've been to Africa.

519
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:54,233
Two months on safari in
Kenya.

520
00:31:54,266 --> 00:31:56,500
-You did?
-Yeah.

521
00:31:56,533 --> 00:31:57,933
Mom was in Africa.

522
00:31:57,966 --> 00:32:01,266
I was in Kenya on a photo shoot.

523
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,400
-Really?
-And where did you go?

524
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:08,800
-[stutters] Nairobi.
-Liz's mom: I mean, on Safari.

525
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:13,766
[nervously] Where didn't I go.
Everywhere. It's uh, beautiful.

526
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,433
-Maasai Mara?
-No, I didn't get there.

527
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:18,200
I just didn't have time.

528
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:21,366
-You didn't go there?
-Mitch: No.

529
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,766
Liz's mom: Well, I'm sure it was
very exciting.

530
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,700
-Did you build this house?
-Yes, we did.

531
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:29,700
Then you'd probably know
where the bathroom is.

532
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:30,666
[all laughing]

533
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:32,933
Liz's mom: Yes, I'm sorry. Get
right in there and make a left.

534
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:36,900
Thank you.

535
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:40,833
Mitch had succeeded in bringing 
his two families together.

536
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:44,866
Now, he could concentrate on 
business again.

537
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,000
Mitch's trips to 
L.A. for Disney,

538
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:49,866
were actually trips 
across town to Candy.

539
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,000
[family chatters]

540
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,966
And Liz found their dream house
less than 15 minutes away.

541
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,266
Thank you.

542
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,733
-Mitch: It's ours honey.
-Yeah!

543
00:32:59,766 --> 00:33:03,600
-Get over here.
-[Liz screams]

544
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:07,400
-Liz: Oh my God!
-[realtor laughs]

545
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:10,800
-Liz: Oh, no, no!
-[realtor laughs]

546
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:14,066
-Yeah, did Delta Corp come in?
-Secretary: Yes, on Wednesday.

547
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,433
- Thirty thousand dollars.
-That's great, Janice.

548
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:18,866
I want you to cut me a check
for $20,000 and send it on down.

549
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,966
I can't. I've already paid it 
out and I have a stack here--

550
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,633
All right, don't worry about it.
What else is coming in?

551
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:25,766
Secretary: Nothing 
that I know of.

552
00:33:27,033 --> 00:33:28,666
I sent those loan papers from 
Mr. Dubrowski down to you.

553
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,233
-Don't worry about him.
- Well, he calls everyday.

554
00:33:31,266 --> 00:33:33,333
Don't worry about him,
all right?

555
00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:34,533
Did the Bahamas guy call?

556
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:36,000
Yes, the Minister of Trade's 
Office.

557
00:33:36,033 --> 00:33:38,233
They want you to come to 
the Bahamas for a meeting.

558
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,700
Great. That is beautiful.

559
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:43,766
Listen, Janice. I'm gonna open
an office down here, okay?

560
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,366
And you're gonna get yourself a
big fat raise. I'll talk to you.

561
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,100
[exhales]

562
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:02,166
Hey, honey.

563
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,366
Oh, Mitch. Barbara Allston
called. She said

564
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,733
-we're gonna lose the house.
-What!

565
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:07,266
She said that
your check was returned.

566
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,733
-They have another offer.
-That's just

567
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:10,700
-a problem at the bank. I'll--
-Call them right away.

568
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:12,766
I'll take care of it. I have
some very exciting news.

569
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,900
-What?
-Let me make this call first.

570
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:18,800
-What? You can tell me now.
-We're going on a cruise.

571
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:20,166
-Why?
-To the Bahamas.

572
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,500
I got to take care of some
business. I want you with me.

573
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,600
And I want to take
your mom and dad with us.

574
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:27,300
It'd be like a second honeymoon.
Won't they'd like that?

575
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,266
-Give them a call and ask them.
-Well, honey, I--

576
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,033
I got to call the bank.

577
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,300
[exhales deeply]

578
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:46,500
Hi, it's me. [laughs] Do you
want to go to the Bahamas?

579
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,533
Liz: I though it was gonna
be one of those big things.

580
00:34:57,566 --> 00:34:59,266
Liz's dad: Our own
private yacht.

581
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,033
Liz's mom: Now this is way
too extravagant.

582
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:02,600
Liz's dad: Ask me [laughs].

583
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,333
Nothing's too extravagant for my
folks. What do you think, dad?

584
00:35:05,433 --> 00:35:08,033
-You like it, mom?
-It's--

585
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,000
-Come on, let's get aboard.
-Liz: All right.

586
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:12,766
[indistinct dialogue]

587
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:17,400
-Ahoy there!
-Liz: Hi.

588
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:20,433
-Welcome aboard The Dove.
-Mitch: Thank you.

589
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:22,933
[inaudible dialogue]

590
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:45,000
-[phone rings]
-Candy: Hello.

591
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:47,100
Mitch: I can only talk for a few
seconds, honey.

592
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:48,966
This may not be a secure phone.

593
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,566
[Candy on phone] Oh honey, I 
miss you so much. Where are you?

594
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,000
I'm on a ship in the
Gulf of Oman.

595
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:57,533
All the devastation, Candy.
I can't begin to tell you.

596
00:35:57,566 --> 00:35:59,866
It's terrible. They just brought
a young child on board

597
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,233
Samantha's age.

598
00:36:01,266 --> 00:36:03,366
Mitch: Burns over 
90% of his body.

599
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,566
Oh, Mitch.

600
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,300
-I hope the poor thing
dies soon.

601
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,866
-[merry chattering
in background]

602
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,100
-How are the children?
-Candy: They're good.

603
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:15,266
-When're you coming home?
-Mitch: In about two weeks.

604
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,566
Mitch: Do you have enough money 
in the account?

605
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,400
-Yeah, we're okay.
-Because I don't think

606
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:22,466
I can get my check
in this month.

607
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
-We'll be fine.
- Okay, good.

608
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,533
-Listen, I have to go now.
-Mitch--

609
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:28,766
-I have to go. I love you.
- Mitch--

610
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:37,800
-[exhales]
-[merry chattering]

611
00:36:44,866 --> 00:36:48,366
[bicycle bell ringing]

612
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,300
Doug, put some more ice
on this lobster, will you?

613
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,133
I want it nice and cold.

614
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:55,533
-I'm looking for Mitch Parker.
-Yes.

615
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:57,900
Are you with the Minister of
Trade's Office?

616
00:36:57,933 --> 00:37:01,233
I'm afraid Mr. Everhart
has had to cancel.

617
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:03,400
We didn't know how
to reach you, exactly.

618
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:05,433
That's all right. We can
reschedule for tomorrow.

619
00:37:05,466 --> 00:37:07,800
No. That would be impossible,
I'm afraid.

620
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:11,166
[laughs] I don't understand.
I had an appointment.

621
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,266
Yes, he did ask me to tell you,
next time you're in the Bahamas,

622
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,166
why don't you give him a call.

623
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,500
No, no, wait a second.

624
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:21,100
He made an appointment with
my office in Los Angeles

625
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:23,566
[screams] to meet him here.

626
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,766
I'm sorry.

627
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,733
Would you mind telling
me what's going on?

628
00:37:32,766 --> 00:37:35,166
Well off the record, he's heard
something about

629
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,833
your associations in
Los Angeles,

630
00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:39,133
which have made him feel
uncomfortable.

631
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,400
I see.

632
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:47,433
Nice to have met you.

633
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:53,766
[ship horn]

634
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,033
Liz: Hey!

635
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:02,033
-Look what we got.
-Hi.

636
00:38:02,066 --> 00:38:03,633
Fertility.

637
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:06,600
[policeman's whistle blows]

638
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:08,166
Liz's mom: John, stop.
You're--

639
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,700
Liz: It was one of those really
snooty affairs, you know?

640
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:14,633
Black tie, crystal, the whole
works. [laughs]

641
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:16,400
So Barbara comes out of the
ladies room--

642
00:38:16,433 --> 00:38:18,500
Oh, please don't do this to me.

643
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:20,966
And she was wearing this
exquisite black dress, only

644
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
with a train of toilet paper
peeping out of the bottom of it.

645
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:29,000
-[all laughing]
-It was stuck in her pantyhose.

646
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:30,200
Oh stop it.

647
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:32,166
She was winding around the
dining room, across the study,

648
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,033
down the hall and she's still
attached to the bathroom.

649
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:40,400
[Liz laughs] This is this crazy
family that you've married into.

650
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:43,733
Excuse me, sir. Can I see you
for a moment?

651
00:38:43,766 --> 00:38:45,900
Sure. Don't tell another story
till I get back, please.

652
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:48,700
Don't worry.

653
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:51,333
-I hate you guys.
-I love you, ma.

654
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:53,500
-It was so cute.
-It was not cute.

655
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,466
All right, it wasn't.
It was dignified.

656
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,266
You turned and saw the paper
and went back like Greta Garbo.

657
00:38:58,366 --> 00:38:59,933
Liz's mom: Not everybody can
pull that off.

658
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:01,266
Liz: Not everyone can.

659
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,700
Liz's dad: Is there a problem?

660
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,366
[laughs shamefacedly] The bank
has confused my account with

661
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,533
some other card holder's

662
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:09,533
and now they're refusing to
accept my card.

663
00:39:09,566 --> 00:39:11,900
-A little tight?
-I'm so embarrassed, John.

664
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,633
I'm sorry. I'll pay you back
as soon as we get back.

665
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:20,033
-How much do you need?
-Five hundred.

666
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,333
-I need the travel checks.
-Oh.

667
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,666
You think mom and dad are
having a good time?

668
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,300
Liz: Uh-huh

669
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,533
[exhales loudly]

670
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,000
-What's going on?
-Hmm.

671
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:52,333
What?

672
00:39:52,366 --> 00:39:53,633
At the restaurant.
What's going on?

673
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:57,233
It's just a little mistake.
I'll get that straightened out.

674
00:39:57,266 --> 00:39:59,666
-[exasperatedly] Mitch.
-What?

675
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,700
It's...

676
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,066
It's just that it doesn't really
make sense.

677
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,700
I mean, they bounce the
check for the deposit
on the house--

678
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:09,500
That was a totally different
bank. I'll talk to my accountant

679
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:11,000
and get it all straightened out.

680
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:14,533
You can't take my parents to
such an expensive restaurant

681
00:40:14,566 --> 00:40:16,733
-and expect them to pay. Just--
-[Mitch laughs]

682
00:40:16,766 --> 00:40:18,966
I'll pay your father back as
soon as we get back to Miami.

683
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,233
You don't understand. He won't
take the money. He's too--

684
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:25,333
What do you want me
to do about that?

685
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:29,133
I want you to tell me
what's going on.

686
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:35,066
That was really embarrassing.

687
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,933
You ungrateful bitch.

688
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:42,733
All you do is take, take, take
and now you sit here

689
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:45,700
and complai--

690
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:47,466
Mitch!

691
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:56,333
[exhales] I...

692
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:02,133
Liz: Hi.
Liz's mom: Hi, sweetie.

693
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:05,833
I'm going to the Gleason's to
pick up the drapery material.

694
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:07,700
You want to come?

695
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:11,000
-I can stop stripping?
-Yeah.

696
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:12,566
Yeah.

697
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,800
There's some lemonade right
over there. I'll be right back.

698
00:41:18,866 --> 00:41:22,366
I'm not procrastinating, I'm
just taking a break.

699
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,000
-Hi.
-Hi, daddy.

700
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:30,266
-Don't be mad at me.
-Why would I be mad at you?

701
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,233
I, uh, checked up on Mitch.

702
00:41:32,266 --> 00:41:35,833
You checked up on him? Why?

703
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:43,433
Honey, doesn't it seem sometimes
that Mitch is a little uh...

704
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:47,533
He doesn't work for Disney.

705
00:41:47,566 --> 00:41:48,900
How do you know that?

706
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:51,233
-You ever been to his office?
-No, it's not finished yet.

707
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:52,433
It's being renovated.

708
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:57,833
I called Bernie Stops.
He works for Mitch's bank.

709
00:41:57,866 --> 00:41:59,833
His checks don't come from
Disney.

710
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,833
Lizzie.

711
00:42:09,866 --> 00:42:11,166
You mad at me?

712
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,300
[phone rings]

713
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,666
Recorded message: You've reached
the offices of

714
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,533
Mitch Parker at 
Walt Disney Productions.

715
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:22,366
Please leave your message after 
the tone.[beeps]

716
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,533
Hi, it's me.
I'm at my parents' house.

717
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:26,766
Can you call me
when you get this?

718
00:42:39,733 --> 00:42:41,433
[phone ringing]

719
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:44,833
-Hello?
-Mitch: Hi, babe.

720
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:48,966
- Everything all right?
-Yeah. Where are you?

721
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,533
I'm at my office. Why?

722
00:42:51,566 --> 00:42:55,133
I-- I wanted to come by.

723
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:57,000
- Now?
-Yeah.

724
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:00,133
[stuttering] I'm going into a 
meeting right now.

725
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:02,833
When can I come by?

726
00:43:02,866 --> 00:43:06,333
- Tomorrow would be good.
-Okay.

727
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:07,733
Yeah, okay, tomorrow.

728
00:43:07,766 --> 00:43:09,933
- How about lunch?
-Yeah.

729
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:21,633
-I'm here to see Mitch Parker.
-Guard: Your name please?

730
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,500
Liz Parker.

731
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:27,066
Thank you, Mrs. Parker.
15th floor.

732
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,066
Make a left hand turn when you
come out of the elevator.

733
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,366
Thanks.

734
00:43:48,866 --> 00:43:50,300
[knocking]

735
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,033
You found me?

736
00:43:56,066 --> 00:44:00,233
[exhales in relief] Mmm-hmm.

737
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:06,000
This is very, very impressive.

738
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:08,300
And really, reallty nice.

739
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:11,000
Not bad for a kid from
Ohio, huh?

740
00:44:11,033 --> 00:44:14,466
Oh, God. Why did I let you talk
me into a Las Vegas wedding.

741
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,033
And how am I gonna tell our
children?

742
00:44:16,066 --> 00:44:18,600
I'll tell and if you're good

743
00:44:18,633 --> 00:44:21,833
I'll get you a get you a spot
in my next movie.

744
00:44:21,866 --> 00:44:25,033
-You'd do that for me?
-Hush. Let's have lunch.

745
00:44:25,066 --> 00:44:26,133
Mitch: Commissary?

746
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,733
-Commissary?
-Sure.

747
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:30,166
-No I wanna go big time.
-Okay,

748
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,766
[door slamming]

749
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,766
I'm gonna call Barbara

750
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,166
and see for closing date to set
on the house.

751
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,100
-I already did.
-Really?

752
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:45,033
- Yes, June 15th.
-[Liz squeals]

753
00:44:45,066 --> 00:44:47,000
-We can start moving in...
Candy: All right, sweet heart.

754
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:49,466
We'll have that again next week.

755
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,400
[engine roaring]

756
00:44:51,433 --> 00:44:56,400
-[tires squealing; cars honk]
-[Liz screams]

757
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:59,033
Mitch! Why did you do that?

758
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:00,666
-You didn't see that?
-What!

759
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,966
You didn't see that guy
back there?

760
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,900
-No.
-He had a gun.

761
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,100
-He pointed a gun at me.
-Should we call the police?

762
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:06,500
No.

763
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:08,266
[Liz exhales heavily]

764
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,466
-Just keep driving.
-God!

765
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,933
Why did Mitch move two wives 
into the same small town?

766
00:45:20,966 --> 00:45:24,300
That is not totally clear. 
What is clear

767
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:27,066
is that it was a huge mistake.

768
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,800
[takes deep breaths]

769
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:33,566
I'll be right out.
[car door opens and slams]

770
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,700
One of them would have to go.

771
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,233
-Mitch shouting: Candy.
-Candy: Mitch.

772
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:40,566
-Mitch: Are you all right?
-Candy: Well, yes.

773
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,333
What's wrong honey?
[water splashing]

774
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:44,733
What! [inaudible]

775
00:45:44,766 --> 00:45:46,666
-We have to activate the plan.
-Oh, my God!

776
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,333
The plan, we have
to activate it.

777
00:45:48,366 --> 00:45:49,833
-How much time do we have?
-We have an hour.

778
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:54,466
-Dennis is outside, baby.
-Get the kids, get the kids.

779
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,700
Candy: Dennis!

780
00:45:56,733 --> 00:45:59,200
-Mitch: I'll get the luggage.
-Okay.

781
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:01,766
Candy: Dennis! Come home
right now.

782
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,533
-Dennis: What's wrong mom?
-Candy: Just get home!

783
00:46:05,566 --> 00:46:07,433
I'll take the kids to
Pennsylvania.

784
00:46:07,466 --> 00:46:09,700
That's a good idea. We'll stay
with your parents just in case.

785
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:12,166
-In case of what, Mitch?
-Where's Samantha?

786
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,533
She's in her room!
Honey, in case what?

787
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:16,500
-What's going on mom?
-Okay. Sweetie,

788
00:46:16,533 --> 00:46:18,666
just go pack your things.
Just what you need, okay?

789
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:23,500
Like we planned. Let's go.

790
00:46:23,533 --> 00:46:25,700
Pack your things. We're out of
here in one hour.

791
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:27,133
-What!
-We're outta here in an hour!

792
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:28,533
Pack!
[door slams]

793
00:46:28,566 --> 00:46:30,066
I want to say goodbye
to Scott and Jamie.

794
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,166
No honey, it's gotta be a really
big secret, okay?

795
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:39,900
We can't talk to anybody.
Pack your bag.

796
00:46:39,933 --> 00:46:41,400
Sammy: I'm not going!

797
00:46:41,433 --> 00:46:42,633
What about our stuff?

798
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,366
We'll pack everything up
as soon as it's safe.

799
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,966
-I'm not going mo--
-[screams] Samantha please,

800
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,433
don't do this right now.

801
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:49,266
-Look, I've got stuff with--
-Do you think this is

802
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,600
some kind of game?
We are in danger here.

803
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,166
-Do you understand that?
-Oh, right!

804
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,133
Go and pack right now,
young lady!

805
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:57,833
-Go, go.
-Sammy: I hate you!

806
00:46:57,866 --> 00:47:00,200
-[slams door]
-Huh, I'm sorry I--

807
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:02,766
-It's okay. I have to go.
-You're not going with us,
Mitch?

808
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,633
Now that they've discovered me,
I don't want to follow you.

809
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:08,600
-I want them to follow me.
-[Candy exhales]

810
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:10,100
Mitch, I'm scared.

811
00:47:10,133 --> 00:47:11,566
There are agents
watching the house.

812
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,433
They'll follow you all the way
to Pennsylvania, okay?

813
00:47:13,466 --> 00:47:14,966
-Where are they?
-If you can see 'em,

814
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,233
they wouldn't be very good,
would they?

815
00:47:17,266 --> 00:47:20,066
-I love you, honey.
-I love you. Be careful.

816
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,600
I will. You'll be all right.

817
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:23,500
I'll call you in Pennsylvania.
It'll be all right.

818
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:24,600
[Candy sobs] Okay.

819
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,066
Mitch: All right. I love you.

820
00:47:43,966 --> 00:47:46,133
This place is a mess.
There's boxes everywhere.

821
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,633
I need an assistant.

822
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:49,300
Did you get those flowers
I sent you?

823
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,733
Janice: Yes, thanks.

824
00:47:50,766 --> 00:47:52,800
And you'll tell me when I can
cash my check right?

825
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,166
Absolutely. What've we got
coming in?

826
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,066
Well, I'm still waiting
to hear from

827
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,966
the Minister of Trade's office.

828
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,066
Forget about that bum.

829
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,666
That trip to the Bahamas was a
bust. [elevator bell rings]

830
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,966
Mitch: I want you to 
call Congressman Rios.

831
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,466
Hi, Mr. Dubrowski.

832
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,233
I'm not here.

833
00:48:10,266 --> 00:48:13,866
Janice: Uh, can I help you with
something?

834
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,066
No, thank you.

835
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,266
What's he doing?

836
00:48:18,366 --> 00:48:22,166
He's putting your paintings
in a cardboard box.

837
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,700
-The good ones?
-Uh-huh.

838
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:29,066
Can I give Mr. Parker
a message for you?

839
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:34,166
No I'll tell him myself.

840
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,166
Mitch, if you want any
of the stuff back,

841
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,066
I'll sell it to you
for $10,000.

842
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,433
I'll call you back.

843
00:48:48,466 --> 00:48:51,600
[bangs the receiver]

844
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:54,900
-And you re-deposited the check?
-Barbara: Yes, twice.

845
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,000
Now, the other thing is

846
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:58,733
your credit report came back 
with a lot of problems.

847
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:01,266
So, the sellers have gone ahead 
and accepted another offer.

848
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,600
-I am sorry.
-I see.

849
00:49:04,633 --> 00:49:07,366
Well, listen Barbara. I think
you handled this whole sale

850
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,233
extremely unprofessionally.

851
00:49:09,266 --> 00:49:12,333
And I won't be doing business
with you again. Good bye.

852
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:17,233
Mr. Parker if you will
excuse me--

853
00:49:17,266 --> 00:49:20,766
Mitch: Read it and weep.

854
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,700
What's this?

855
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,833
It's a geological survey
on our house. [laughs]

856
00:49:24,866 --> 00:49:26,633
We have a few problems.

857
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:28,433
There's cracks all
through the foundation,

858
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:31,666
-water seepage everywhere.
-Oh, no.

859
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,700
Our dream house was built
on a swamp.

860
00:49:35,733 --> 00:49:38,800
-This is not swampland.
-It's not a swampland anymore.

861
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:41,700
It's landfill. It was a swamp.

862
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:44,800
I have a good mind to sue
these bastards. I think I will.

863
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:47,066
Oh, God!

864
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,066
On a swamp!

865
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,633
I need a drink.

866
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:58,900
7-8-9-0, Parker. P-A-R-K-E-R.

867
00:49:58,933 --> 00:50:01,700
That's Candy and Mitch.

868
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:04,233
[birds chirping]

869
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:07,966
Mitch: Okay, so you definitely 
got the change of address?

870
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,433
And the next statement will go 
to Pennsylvania?

871
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,333
Can you tell me when last
month's statement was mailed?

872
00:50:20,366 --> 00:50:22,333
[paper rustling]

873
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,400
Thank you.

874
00:50:29,433 --> 00:50:30,933
[phone clicks off]

875
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,800
Guess who's going to Europe
this afternoon?

876
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:44,233
I give up.

877
00:50:44,266 --> 00:50:46,533
That was the office
on the phone.

878
00:50:46,566 --> 00:50:48,566
Trying to get Tom Cruise to sign
a development deal.

879
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,500
Sid wants me to go along.

880
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:56,966
I think they're grooming me
for the film division.

881
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,733
Tom Cruise?

882
00:50:58,766 --> 00:51:00,333
[snickers]

883
00:51:00,366 --> 00:51:02,900
Yeah I'm gonna have dinner
with him tonight.

884
00:51:02,933 --> 00:51:05,000
[crickets chirping]

885
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:07,666
Mitch: Ah, man, I can't believe 
this happened again.

886
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,233
I keep changing my card number

887
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,900
but this guy keeps
finding the number.

888
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:13,900
I guess I'm just gonna
have to prosecute.

889
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:15,033
I don't want to but...

890
00:51:21,366 --> 00:51:22,800
Okay, the truth.

891
00:51:24,733 --> 00:51:29,200
I met this woman on an airplane.

892
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:31,366
And I fell in love with her.

893
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,133
And I married her. It's not that
I don't love you anymore. I--

894
00:51:40,533 --> 00:51:45,433
I keep changing the number,
but he keeps finding it.

895
00:51:45,466 --> 00:51:48,166
I'm gonna prosecute.

896
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,066
[car door opens and shuts]

897
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,700
Can you tell me
where you've been?

898
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:55,866
I've been everywhere,
Los Angeles, Miami, Washington.

899
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,733
Tomorrow morning,
I have to leave for Israel.

900
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:01,000
Where is everyone?

901
00:52:01,033 --> 00:52:05,033
My parents took Dennis to a
basketball game.

902
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:09,400
-How's he handling it?
-Oh, he's okay.

903
00:52:09,433 --> 00:52:12,600
He misses his friends.

904
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:19,266
Mitch, Samantha's gone.
She ran away basically.

905
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,266
What?

906
00:52:21,366 --> 00:52:25,100
I mean, she's in Los Angeles
with her father, but...

907
00:52:25,133 --> 00:52:27,033
she doesn't want to come back.

908
00:52:27,066 --> 00:52:30,733
-I'm sorry about that. honey.
-I don't know.

909
00:52:30,766 --> 00:52:36,200
It's probably the best thing
for her. So, it's good.

910
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:42,700
Uh, credit card bill came.

911
00:52:42,733 --> 00:52:47,266
-It's maxed out, right?
-Yeah.

912
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,933
Let me see that. It was stolen.

913
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:53,533
-It was stolen?
-The credit card was stolen.

914
00:52:53,566 --> 00:52:55,800
Well, this guy's having
a lot of fun, huh?

915
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:59,766
The Bahamas, furniture,
lingerie.

916
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,600
-Well, the lingerie's mine.
-[laughs]

917
00:53:04,633 --> 00:53:06,500
It's not the first time
he's done this.

918
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:08,533
Give me the number.
Let's call them right now.

919
00:53:08,566 --> 00:53:11,700
Doesn't matter.
The card's run to it's limit.

920
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:13,233
-But we should call them, Mitch
-It's okay.

921
00:53:13,266 --> 00:53:17,000
There's more important, pressing
business to deal with right now.

922
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:25,466
Come on.

923
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,700
[footsteps receding]

924
00:53:27,733 --> 00:53:30,966
-When's the game over?
-We've got time.

925
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,766
[paper rustling]

926
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:04,933
Liz: Honey, this doesn't
make sense.

927
00:54:04,966 --> 00:54:06,533
Liz: Why don't we just stay in
the apartment?

928
00:54:06,566 --> 00:54:08,366
I don't want to stay in the
apartment anymore.

929
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,733
It's driving me crazy.

930
00:54:09,766 --> 00:54:11,966
Besides, why let an investment
property sit empty?

931
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,933
-Then, why don't you rent it?
-Because they want to sell it.

932
00:54:14,966 --> 00:54:17,700
The last tenants drove me crazy.

933
00:54:17,733 --> 00:54:22,100
[water spraying]

934
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,300
What do you think?

935
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:26,966
-Well, I think it's kinda cute.
-Nice isn't it?

936
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,400
Yeah.

937
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,066
[Liz moaning]

938
00:54:33,366 --> 00:54:35,733
[Liz giggling]

939
00:54:35,766 --> 00:54:38,066
[water spraying against wall]

940
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:42,200
Hello, Mary.

941
00:54:42,233 --> 00:54:44,966
I thought you'd be
up at the lake.

942
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,833
No, Tom's brother got a stroke,

943
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:52,100
Oh, that's too bad.
I'll come and visit in a bit.

944
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:59,000
What did I do with
the house keys?

945
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:00,666
They're right here.

946
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,133
-Shall we take a look inside?
-Yeah.

947
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:17,300
Well you're right, honey.
That--

948
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:20,833
You don't even want to hear the 
tale Mitch spun to convince Liz

949
00:55:20,866 --> 00:55:24,233
that, contrary to everything 
he'd said on the way 
to the house,

950
00:55:24,266 --> 00:55:28,366
they didn't in fact want to 
live in that house after all.

951
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,666
Suffice it to say, Liz was 
getting whiplash

952
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,100
from the ride Mitch 
was taking her on.

953
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:37,633
Man: Mrs. Parker, may I speak to
you for a moment please?

954
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:39,233
Certainly.

955
00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:44,100
But this was nothing to the ride 
Candy was about to take.

956
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:47,333
This account is seriously
overdrawn.

957
00:55:47,366 --> 00:55:50,600
Aah, no, I only opened it
last week

958
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:53,100
and it should have
over $12,000 dollars in it.

959
00:55:53,133 --> 00:55:54,666
But there was a large
withdrawal

960
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,333
and several checks after that.

961
00:55:56,366 --> 00:55:58,233
Uh, what withdrawal?

962
00:55:58,266 --> 00:56:01,566
On the 16th, your husband zeroed
out the account.

963
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:07,566
-$11, 242 dollars.
-[takes a deep breath]

964
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,033
He must've moved the money.

965
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:16,600
So, I need to talk to my
husband.

966
00:56:16,633 --> 00:56:18,600
No. You're not understanding me.

967
00:56:18,633 --> 00:56:20,800
-The card was stolen.
-Woman: Are you certain?

968
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:24,266
Yes! My husband reported it
stolen three days ago.

969
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,600
I have no record of that.

970
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:28,366
Your husband is Mitchell Parker, 
is that correct?

971
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,266
Yes. What about
the signatures, huh?

972
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,133
Have you even checked the
signatures?

973
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:35,966
This account has a month of 
charges, ma'am.

974
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,933
If the card was stolen,

975
00:56:37,033 --> 00:56:38,533
it should have been reported 
immediately.

976
00:56:38,566 --> 00:56:41,466
Look, there's over $20,000
on this card.

977
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,100
[angrily] Neither my husband nor
I made the purchases.

978
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:46,633
I'm looking at these signatures

979
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:48,433
and they appear to be authentic, 
ma'am.

980
00:56:48,466 --> 00:56:53,566
Shall I connect you with our 
Payment Plan office?

981
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,366
[paper slams against wood]

982
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,600
[door opens]
[light switch clicks]

983
00:57:00,633 --> 00:57:04,033
Did I know you were
coming into town?

984
00:57:04,066 --> 00:57:05,166
No.

985
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,066
Why are you sitting
on the floor?

986
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:14,700
Well, thank God you're here.
We've got problems.

987
00:57:14,733 --> 00:57:18,700
I would say that the most
pressing is the Chadway account.

988
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:21,166
-It's over, Janice.
-What do you mean?

989
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,233
It means I owe a lot of money.
That's it.

990
00:57:23,266 --> 00:57:25,600
I'm closing up shop.

991
00:57:25,633 --> 00:57:28,666
But you can keep all
the office equipment.

992
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,500
Computer, fax machine,
phones, everything.

993
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,366
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

994
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,766
It'll cover the money
I owe you.

995
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,566
Well, I have a stack
of bills here.

996
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:40,666
What am I supposed
to do with these?

997
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:47,933
Close the door and walk away.

998
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:51,033
And my number in Florida...

999
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:56,766
I guess I don't have
your number in Florida.

1000
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,966
Thanks. Thanks for
everything, Janice.

[phone ringing]

1004
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:19,633
Mary: Tom. Tom, you got that?
[phone ringing]

1005
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:22,366
Did you put your
hearing thing in?

1006
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,433
Tom: What?

1007
00:58:24,466 --> 00:58:27,400
-Hello
- Hi Mary. It's Candy.

1008
00:58:27,433 --> 00:58:31,666
Candy! Where are you?
What in God's name is going on?

1009
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:36,400
Can't really explain anything
right now. But, uh...

1010
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:39,533
you haven't by any chance seen
Mitch, have you?

1011
00:58:39,566 --> 00:58:44,633
Mitch. As a matter of fact,
Candy, we saw him last Friday.

1012
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:49,666
-Where?
-Well, here at your house.

1013
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,533
-Mary, are you sure it was him?
- I talked to him.

1014
00:58:53,566 --> 00:58:56,733
Candy, I don't know if you
want to hear this.

1015
00:58:56,766 --> 00:59:01,500
I've been just sick about it,
but, he wasn't alone.

1016
00:59:01,533 --> 00:59:04,600
Well, who was he with?

1017
00:59:04,633 --> 00:59:07,033
He was with a woman.

1018
00:59:07,066 --> 00:59:09,600
Oh Mary, that was probably just
somebody from work.

1019
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:13,100
I don't know what kind of work
Mitch does exactly,

1020
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:19,033
but this woman was wearing a
pair of shorts and a tank top.

1021
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:23,200
What were they doing?

1022
00:59:23,233 --> 00:59:25,333
Mary?

1023
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:27,366
Honey, they were kissing.

1024
00:59:31,866 --> 00:59:36,033
Liz: I'm losing my mind.
I'm going insane.

1025
00:59:36,066 --> 00:59:37,433
-What's the matter?
-We are being evicted

1026
00:59:37,466 --> 00:59:40,000
-from the apartment.
-What do you mean?

1027
00:59:40,033 --> 00:59:43,833
I mean that Mitch didn't pay the
rent and they want us out.

1028
00:59:43,866 --> 00:59:46,700
I'm out there shopping for homes
that are half a million dollars

1029
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:49,300
and we can't even come up with
$800 a month rent

1030
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:51,766
for an apartment.
What is wrong with this picture?

1031
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,333
-What does Mitch say about ti?
-I don't know. He's in New York,

1032
00:59:55,366 --> 00:59:58,000
or he's in L.A.,
or he's somewhere.

1033
00:59:58,033 --> 01:00:00,966
Why don't you try to calm down.
Make yourself a sandwich.

1034
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,766
There's some tuna fish there.

1035
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,833
[exhales]

1036
01:00:09,233 --> 01:00:12,400
What?

1037
01:00:12,433 --> 01:00:14,566
Just say it.

1038
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,166
I already said it.
You know how I feel.

1039
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:23,100
That he doesn't work for Disney.
Daddy, I was in his office.

1040
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:26,200
I was in his office.

1041
01:00:26,233 --> 01:00:28,600
Hello. I need to reach my
husband.

1042
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:33,000
And he's an agent. His name
is Mitchell R. Parker.

1043
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:36,000
Woman: I'm sorry, I show no 
record of a Mitchell R. Parker

1044
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:36,766
with the CIA.

1045
01:00:38,033 --> 01:00:39,333
I understand you can't give the
information out over the phone.

1046
01:00:39,366 --> 01:00:42,566
But please, this is
really a family emergency.

1047
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,500
I can turn this over 
to the supervisor

1048
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:45,566
and perhaps he can help.

1049
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,500
-Can I help you with something?
-No, thank you.

1050
01:00:48,533 --> 01:00:52,666
Excuse me, ma'am.

1051
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:57,500
I am so sorry, Mr. Parker.

1052
01:00:57,533 --> 01:01:02,666
Ma'am, can we help you with
something?

1053
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,500
This is Anthony Tobias, 
CIA Personnel, Washington.

1054
01:01:06,533 --> 01:01:08,566
I understand you're trying to 
reach you husband,

1055
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,533
- a Mitchell R. Parker?
-That's right.

1056
01:01:11,566 --> 01:01:14,566
We have no Mitchell Parker 
working at the Agency.

1057
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,833
Well...

1058
01:01:16,866 --> 01:01:20,600
I have a password.
It's Paper Chase.

1059
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:23,766
Ma'am, it's not a question 
of passwords.

1060
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,066
According to our records, 
Mitchell R. Parker

1061
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:31,466
does not work for the CIA 
and never has. I'm sorry.

1062
01:01:37,733 --> 01:01:42,266
[airplane hum]

1063
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:46,766
[phone rings in background]

1064
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,966
-Candy: Hello.
-It's me.

1065
01:01:53,933 --> 01:01:55,433
Where are you?

1066
01:01:55,466 --> 01:01:57,533
It doesn't matter where I am. 
I just wanted to call

1067
01:01:57,566 --> 01:02:00,833
and let you know 
I'm still alive.

1068
01:02:00,866 --> 01:02:04,600
Well Mitch, um, I was just so
frightened that

1069
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:09,100
they'd murdered you,
that I called the CIA.

1070
01:02:09,133 --> 01:02:12,433
Why would you do that? I told
you never to contact them.

1071
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:14,666
Don't you understand how that
would compromise things?

1072
01:02:14,766 --> 01:02:17,200
Don't bother Mitch.
[laughs hysterically]

1073
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:21,233
You see, the CIA
has never heard of you.

1074
01:02:21,266 --> 01:02:22,566
Of course they haven't.

1075
01:02:22,766 --> 01:02:25,300
They're not gonna identify one
of their agents over the phone.

1076
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:28,733
Who is she?
[loudly] Who is she Mitch?

1077
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:34,400
[sighs]

1078
01:02:35,533 --> 01:02:38,733
It was just a one week fling,
honey.

1079
01:02:38,766 --> 01:02:40,600
I'm sorry, I've been 
under so much--

1080
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:44,166
[screams] Is this happening
to me?

1081
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,666
You leave us without a dime.

1082
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,300
With a $22,000
credit card bill

1083
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:52,500
and you run off with some
woman. [sobbing]

1084
01:02:52,533 --> 01:02:55,833
I'm sorry, honey.
I really messed up.

1085
01:02:55,866 --> 01:02:59,133
That's supposed to make me
feel better?

1086
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:01,700
'Cause you see, it doesn't.

1087
01:03:01,733 --> 01:03:06,766
You are a liar and a cheat.

1088
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,966
And you've abandoned
my children.

1089
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,966
And if there's any way for me
to press charges,

1090
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,433
-I promise you Mitch--
-Are you threatening me?

1091
01:03:17,466 --> 01:03:20,500
Oh, no. I am telling you.

1092
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:23,233
Is that supposed to be a threat?

1093
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,133
Because if it is,

1094
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:29,566
I promise you, if you go to
the police and say one word,

1095
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:35,600
they'll be looking for a new
mother for your children.

1096
01:03:35,633 --> 01:03:37,466
My God!
[phone slams]

1097
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,400
[Candy sobbing]

1098
01:03:50,933 --> 01:03:52,933
[door opens]

1099
01:03:54,466 --> 01:03:59,066
Mitch: Hey, honey.

1100
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,366
You're up pretty early.

1101
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,833
Is everything all right?

1102
01:04:03,866 --> 01:04:05,966
Sit down, Mitch.

1103
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,733
Oh. If I'm in the doghouse I'd
better get a cup of coffee.

1104
01:04:11,766 --> 01:04:14,600
Mitch, sit down.

1105
01:04:14,633 --> 01:04:18,700
Okay.

1106
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:23,533
-What is it?
-[Liz sighs]

1107
01:04:23,566 --> 01:04:27,166
I went to your office.

1108
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,933
I met Mitchell Parker.

1109
01:04:30,966 --> 01:04:34,500
You don't work for Disney.

1110
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,633
Liz, I'm an independent
contractor. I--

1111
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:41,633
How do you earn your living?

1112
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:43,966
What do you think,
I broke into his office?

1113
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,866
-You tell me.
-What's wrong with you, Liz?

1114
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:49,633
How do you support us?

1115
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:51,400
[stutters] What's wrong? What--

1116
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:53,533
They are evicting us
from this apartment.

1117
01:04:53,566 --> 01:04:55,600
They're not going to evict us.
I'm holding the check

1118
01:04:55,633 --> 01:05:00,200
-until we get the dryer fixed.
-[yells] Will you just stop it?

1119
01:05:00,233 --> 01:05:03,000
You really need to get help,
you know that?

1120
01:05:03,033 --> 01:05:04,733
-I can't take this anymore.
-Liz , Liz--

1121
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:06,200
-I'm going to my parents
-No.

1122
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,633
And when you're ready to be
honest with me, you call--

1123
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:11,733
No Liz no, let me just explain
something. Just--

1124
01:05:11,766 --> 01:05:15,300
No. Now, you have a serious,
serious problem.

1125
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:17,233
And when you're ready to
acknowledge that

1126
01:05:17,266 --> 01:05:19,100
I will help you any way
that I can.

1127
01:05:19,133 --> 01:05:21,866
Don't!

1128
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,433
[whispers] Don't.

1129
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,833
[footsteps receding]

1130
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,000
-[door slams]
-[Mitch sighs]

1131
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,566
[car engine roars]

1132
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,400
Liz' Friend: I mean, did he
even look like Mitch?

1133
01:05:42,433 --> 01:05:45,966
Ha. No. it was a 70-year-old
bald man.

1134
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,966
-He was bald?
-Yeah.

1135
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,233
And there was the exact same
picture frame

1136
01:05:50,266 --> 01:05:53,066
-with his family in it.
-Oh, man.

1137
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,333
And the secretary, she flips
out. She calls security

1138
01:05:56,366 --> 01:05:59,300
and I'm escorted out of the
building.

1139
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:01,733
-[Liz's friend laughs]
-Hey. This is not funny.

1140
01:06:01,766 --> 01:06:03,366
-[laughs] No, it's not not.
-No, it was awful.

1141
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,033
You are supposed to be
my best friend.

1142
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:06,033
I am.

1143
01:06:06,066 --> 01:06:09,400
Liz: Maybe it was a little
funny. [laughs]

1144
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:13,766
I'm not ready to just
laugh at that, yet.

1145
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,200
[door slams]

1146
01:06:15,233 --> 01:06:16,433
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

1147
01:06:16,466 --> 01:06:18,733
I feel like I'm on a
merry-go-round, you know.

1148
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:21,633
I don't have a kleenex honey,
wipe your nose.

1149
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:27,733
[sobs] I mean, I love him.
He's a terrific guy,
but these lies.

1150
01:06:27,766 --> 01:06:30,733
Why would he want to lie to me?

1151
01:06:30,766 --> 01:06:33,566
I think you've got to get Mitch
into some serious shrinkage.

1152
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:37,833
And you've got to set the ground
rules between the two of you.

1153
01:06:37,866 --> 01:06:43,666
-That's what you've gotta do.
-Yeah.

1154
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,866
-[Liz sighs]
-It's gonna be all right.

1155
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,433
You'll see.

1156
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,066
That was Mitch.

1157
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:59,166
This crab just
tried to bite me.

1158
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,866
-He wants to talk.
-That's good. Good

1159
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,600
[crickets chirping]

1160
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:14,566
[door opens]

1161
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:18,866
-Hi.
-Hi.

1162
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,466
Do you want to come in?

1163
01:07:25,266 --> 01:07:26,533
[door shuts]

1164
01:07:29,033 --> 01:07:32,600
-A drink?
-Uh, no thanks.

1165
01:07:39,066 --> 01:07:40,133
Liz.

1166
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,533
You were right. I lied.

1167
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:54,733
About Disney.
I don't really work there,

1168
01:07:54,766 --> 01:07:56,633
full-time...

1169
01:07:56,666 --> 01:08:06,400
you see.
So I don't have an office.

1170
01:08:06,433 --> 01:08:08,800
You see, the kind of work
I do for them, I--

1171
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:13,233
-Mitch.
-What?

1172
01:08:13,266 --> 01:08:15,866
You don't work for Disney.

1173
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,800
You don't work for Disney. And
you obviously have no money.

1174
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:25,433
Just stop lying.
Can't you stop?

1175
01:08:25,466 --> 01:08:28,900
I'm sorry.

1176
01:08:28,933 --> 01:08:32,466
I did lie. I lied about...

1177
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,933
the money that I inherit.
The $2 million.

1178
01:08:34,966 --> 01:08:37,766
I inherited. It's all gone.
I blew it. I spent it.

1179
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:41,733
And the will, it's being
contested in court by my mother.

1180
01:08:41,766 --> 01:08:46,733
And there's this protracted
What's the matter? What--

1181
01:08:46,766 --> 01:08:49,866
You told me that your mother
died when you were five.

1182
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,233
She did. I'm talking about my
stepmother.

1183
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:55,500
[Liz sighs]
-Mitch: Liz.

1184
01:08:55,533 --> 01:08:59,966
Liz please don't leave me.
Liz don't you...

1185
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,200
[door slaming]

1186
01:09:01,233 --> 01:09:02,833
[keys rattling]

1187
01:09:13,133 --> 01:09:15,566
[trunk door opens]

1188
01:09:23,066 --> 01:09:24,700
[trunk slams shut]

1189
01:09:26,066 --> 01:09:32,533
Man on TV: Let me spell it for 
you. Mile High Club.

1190
01:09:32,566 --> 01:09:33,800
I thought you were leaving.

1191
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:37,966
There are guns in the back
of your car.

1192
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,233
-I know.
-Why?

1193
01:09:40,266 --> 01:09:42,433
-I bought them.
-Why?

1194
01:09:42,466 --> 01:09:46,033
-Because.
-Because why?

1195
01:09:46,066 --> 01:09:49,133
Because I realized my life isn't
worth living if you're not in it

1196
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:55,833
[footsteps fade]

1197
01:09:56,433 --> 01:09:57,833
[door slams]

1198
01:10:01,633 --> 01:10:06,133
Woman on TV: Oh, my God.

1199
01:10:07,766 --> 01:10:09,000
[knocking]

1200
01:10:12,466 --> 01:10:13,833
[knocking continues]

1201
01:10:33,466 --> 01:10:36,333
-It's 1 in the morning.
-I know.

1202
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:38,866
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

1203
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,700
I need to talk to you Liz.
I just feel like--

1204
01:10:41,733 --> 01:10:45,133
-Mitch.
-Please.

1205
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:48,033
Liz, I know I've been
awful to you.

1206
01:10:48,066 --> 01:10:50,900
But please, just give me a
chance. I just...

1207
01:10:50,933 --> 01:10:54,200
Please.

1208
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:55,433
Okay.

1209
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:07,100
I hope I didn't
wake up your parents.

1210
01:11:07,133 --> 01:11:08,933
They're not here. They're
visiting my brother.

1211
01:11:08,966 --> 01:11:16,133
-What's going on with you?
-[Mitch sobs]

1212
01:11:16,166 --> 01:11:21,533
I just feel like...

1213
01:11:21,566 --> 01:11:26,700
I feel disconnected.
I can't-- I--

1214
01:11:26,733 --> 01:11:30,533
Please don't...
Don't give up on me just...

1215
01:11:30,566 --> 01:11:33,400
-Please, just don't.
-Mitch, I...

1216
01:11:33,433 --> 01:11:37,500
I need you. Please, please.

1217
01:11:37,533 --> 01:11:40,066
-Listen, let's make love.
-No, I don't want to.

1218
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,533
-No Liz, let's make love,
please.
-No! stop it.

1219
01:11:42,566 --> 01:11:45,100
-You used to love it--
-Stop It!

1220
01:11:52,366 --> 01:11:55,200
You want to know what's wrong,

1221
01:11:55,233 --> 01:11:58,633
Liz?

1222
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:00,633
You're ruining my life.

1223
01:12:00,666 --> 01:12:04,633
You're bleeding me.
No wonder I'm broke. You...

1224
01:12:04,666 --> 01:12:08,300
You're bleeding me.
You see, you're all alike.

1225
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:11,733
Because every time it's good,
as long as it's good,

1226
01:12:11,766 --> 01:12:14,733
everything's fine. But the
moment it's bad, you just leave.

1227
01:12:14,766 --> 01:12:17,066
What's going on down here?

1228
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,666
Nothing, everything's fine.

1229
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,633
-Back to bed, everything's fine.
-[Liz gasps and cries]

1230
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:26,800
Take your hands off her, Mitch.
I'll call the police, Mitch.

1231
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:29,300
-Let her go!
-Don't you threaten me!

1232
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:33,433
Don't you threaten me!

1233
01:12:33,466 --> 01:12:36,966
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

1234
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,800
[Liz cries] No.
[door slams]

1235
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:43,100
[loud knocking]
[Liz shouting]

1236
01:12:46,966 --> 01:12:49,800
[Liz crying]

1237
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:53,000
See what you do?
See what you do to me?

1238
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:54,433
[loudly] You bitch!

1239
01:12:54,466 --> 01:12:56,966
-Mitch: You make me nuts!
-[Liz sobbing]

1240
01:13:03,733 --> 01:13:08,100
-[Liz sobbing]
-Mitch: Liz, I love you.

1241
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:10,166
[whispers] I love you so much.

1242
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,000
[breathing hard]

1243
01:13:18,633 --> 01:13:22,900
Mitch: Liz, do you know what I 
have in my hand?

1244
01:13:22,933 --> 01:13:26,166
Mitch: I have a gun.

1245
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,800
I want you to give me one reason

1246
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:31,966
why I shouldn't put this gun 
in my mouth

1247
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,033
and pull the trigger.

1248
01:13:36,066 --> 01:13:37,466
Please.

1249
01:13:55,033 --> 01:13:56,466
[door opens]
[Liz gasps]

1250
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,466
He's gone. I called the police.

1251
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,833
[Liz sobbing] Oh, God.

1252
01:14:01,866 --> 01:14:05,133
-It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.
-I'm so scared.

1253
01:14:05,166 --> 01:14:08,000
-I know. I know.
-I'm so scared. I'm so scared.

1254
01:14:08,033 --> 01:14:11,733
I know. It's okay.

1255
01:14:11,766 --> 01:14:13,900
Barbara: I think the police
are right. You should file a

1256
01:14:13,933 --> 01:14:16,333
restraining order.

1257
01:14:16,366 --> 01:14:18,233
He's never acted like this
before.

1258
01:14:18,266 --> 01:14:19,733
Before what?
You just met the guy.

1259
01:14:19,766 --> 01:14:21,633
-I did not, Dad.
-Barbara: John.

1260
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,566
I don't want him coming
near you.

1261
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,466
He threatened suicide,
not homicide.

1262
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,166
Oh jeez, Liz. Look at your arm.

1263
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:32,166
That's assault. We're filing for
a restraining order.

1264
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:36,266
I agree.

1265
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,500
Okay.

1266
01:14:38,533 --> 01:14:41,333
I'm a little nervous
about the time.

1267
01:14:41,366 --> 01:14:45,466
-I'd better go.
-John: I'll take you.

1268
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,866
It was so good seeing you again.
Thank you for coming down.

1269
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,266
Thank you for being
here for Liz.

1270
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,933
No problem.

1271
01:14:54,966 --> 01:15:01,500
No problem.

1272
01:15:01,533 --> 01:15:05,566
Well, what do you know
about him that is true.

1273
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,400
Umm, well he was uh...

1274
01:15:10,433 --> 01:15:12,033
He went umm...

1275
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,666
[sighs]

1276
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:23,200
-Who knows?
-Okay, don't worry.

1277
01:15:23,233 --> 01:15:25,166
Did you bring
his license number?

1278
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,766
Yes I did.

1279
01:15:32,533 --> 01:15:35,500
Do you think that
you can help me?

1280
01:15:35,533 --> 01:15:39,333
Oh, yeah. With a few phone calls
and the grace of God,

1281
01:15:39,366 --> 01:15:41,000
we'll be just fine.

1282
01:15:45,133 --> 01:15:47,733
[gunshot]

1283
01:15:47,766 --> 01:15:49,700
[breathing hard]

1284
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,400
[door opens]

1285
01:16:01,233 --> 01:16:02,633
Liz.

1286
01:16:13,666 --> 01:16:17,366
There are two names on the deed
to the house at Castlebury.

1287
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,166
The same two names
are on your husband's

1288
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,600
current California
car registration.

1289
01:16:22,633 --> 01:16:28,266
He's got a lot of calls going to
Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania.

1290
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:32,933
Does Mitchell have a sister
named Candace?

1291
01:16:32,966 --> 01:16:36,400
Not that I know of.

1292
01:16:36,433 --> 01:16:39,933
Does your husband
travel a lot for his work?

1293
01:16:39,966 --> 01:16:42,566
All the time.

1294
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,700
Why?

1295
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:01,966
[inaudible dialogue]

1296
01:17:28,766 --> 01:17:30,400
[knocking]

1297
01:17:39,066 --> 01:17:43,466
Candace Parker?

1298
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,833
Liz Parker?

1299
01:17:45,866 --> 01:17:48,266
Yeah.

1300
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,700
Come on in.

1301
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,266
Liz, we're out of wine but I
found some brandy.

1302
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,366
-No, that's fine.
-It should be good.

1303
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,966
Tonight I'd drink
nail polish remover.

1304
01:18:08,066 --> 01:18:12,933
I've got plenty of that.

1305
01:18:12,966 --> 01:18:16,366
Oh, ah, this.

1306
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,733
The last I talked to him, he
threatened me too.

1307
01:18:19,766 --> 01:18:22,733
I taped it for what it's worth.

1308
01:18:22,766 --> 01:18:25,133
It is.

1309
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:27,000
This is our trip to the Bahamas.

1310
01:18:27,033 --> 01:18:29,800
Oh, yeah.

1311
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:31,866
I'm still trying to figure out
how to pay for that.

1312
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,100
No, no, no.
I'm going to pay for that.

1313
01:18:34,133 --> 01:18:38,166
It's going to take a little
time, but I'm gonna to pay.

1314
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:42,533
[sighs] I just, uh...

1315
01:18:42,566 --> 01:18:45,466
I can't believe
how stupid I was.

1316
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,233
-You're not stupid.
-Yes. [laughs]

1317
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:53,033
And neither am I.

1318
01:18:53,066 --> 01:18:59,600
He's just very, very slick.

1319
01:18:59,633 --> 01:19:04,066
So?

1320
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:07,100
So, we go to the police

1321
01:19:07,133 --> 01:19:08,733
and we destroy him.

1322
01:19:21,933 --> 01:19:23,633
[knocking]

1323
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:34,133
-Hello Marta. Is Liz here?
-Marta: No, no here.

1324
01:19:34,166 --> 01:19:36,666
I want to leave
these flowers for her.

1325
01:19:48,633 --> 01:19:50,766
I'll just leave a little note.

1326
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,633
[tap running]

1327
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,933
[phone buttons beep]

1328
01:20:20,633 --> 01:20:22,500
Man on phone: US Air. This is 
Todd. How may I help you?

1329
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,600
Hello Todd. I'd like to make a
reservation

1330
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:28,866
On Flight 149 tomorrow morning
Orlando to Washington please.

1331
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:31,133
Okay. Hold a moment.

1332
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:37,766
I'm sorry. I'm showing 
Flight 149 is 
Orlando-Pittsburgh.

1333
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,033
Orlando-Washington at around 
that time would be Flight 215.

1334
01:20:42,066 --> 01:20:43,433
[phone receiver crashes back]

1335
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:58,633
Liz: I'm going to meet Candace 
in Las Vegas when I get back.

1336
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:03,600
And we're going to file bigamy
charges in Clark County.

1337
01:21:03,633 --> 01:21:07,400
I think you're doing
the right thing.

1338
01:21:07,433 --> 01:21:09,900
I understand why she's mad.

1339
01:21:09,933 --> 01:21:12,533
I really do. I mean I do.
I know I screwed up.

1340
01:21:12,566 --> 01:21:14,433
I really screwed up.

1341
01:21:20,233 --> 01:21:23,533
Thank you for your help,
Mr. Cox.

1342
01:21:23,566 --> 01:21:26,566
In my experience, it would be
best if you were to steer

1343
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,233
well clear of him.

1344
01:21:29,266 --> 01:21:31,400
Sometimes,

1345
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:40,733
I feel that maybe
I should just...

1346
01:21:40,766 --> 01:21:47,566
You know, I used to pride myself
on my insight and intuition.

1347
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,333
Boy, did I get this wrong!

1348
01:21:51,366 --> 01:21:54,266
I'm sorry.

1349
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,666
Thanks.

1350
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:06,333
I think they're gonna do
something to me.

1351
01:22:06,366 --> 01:22:10,766
And I'm afraid.

1352
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,700
Do you know why I did
everything that I did?

1353
01:22:15,733 --> 01:22:19,366
Because I just wanted
them to love me.

1354
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,066
That's all I ever wanted.

1355
01:22:27,166 --> 01:22:28,933
Is that so wrong?

1356
01:22:40,266 --> 01:22:42,933
Liz's recorded message: Mitch, 
I'm calling to let you know

1357
01:22:42,966 --> 01:22:44,633
I'm moving away. I don't want 
you to try and find me.

1358
01:22:44,666 --> 01:22:49,166
I don't ever want to talk to you 
or see you again.

1359
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,633
You can pick up your things at

1360
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:54,266
the Orlando Boulevard Storage 
Lockers. It's locker 2B.

1361
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,633
If you've lost your key, I'll 
leave mine at the office.

1362
01:23:03,733 --> 01:23:06,700
Please don't come 
before 12 noon.

1363
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:09,333
Oh, and Mitch, I met Candy.

1364
01:23:09,366 --> 01:23:12,766
We had a very 
interesting conversation.

1365
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,966
[answering machine beeps off]

1366
01:23:17,733 --> 01:23:19,733
[glass shatters]

1367
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,633
Well, that's it.

1368
01:23:39,666 --> 01:23:41,133
What time do we have to go?

1369
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:43,500
Narrator: On the 
morning of September 15th,

1370
01:23:43,533 --> 01:23:46,666
Liz came down 
to breakfast.

1371
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:50,433
They set a time they 
would leave for the airport.

1372
01:23:50,466 --> 01:23:52,933
Her father offered to 
help her collect her things

1373
01:23:52,966 --> 01:23:54,900
from the storage locker.

1374
01:23:54,933 --> 01:23:59,266
But she insisted he go to his 
tennis match instead.

1375
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:03,666
He won the 1st set. 
But lost the next two.

1376
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,866
[parking brake engages]

1377
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,500
-Hi.
-Hi.

1378
01:24:23,533 --> 01:24:25,966
-Moving?
-Liz: I hope so.

1379
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,566
I just want to get out of here.

1380
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,566
Doesn't sound good.

1381
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,566
[steel rolling door screeches]

1382
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,400
-You're coming undone.
-Sorry?

1383
01:24:35,433 --> 01:24:39,133
-Liz: The box. Underneath.
-[laughs] Oh, thanks.

1384
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:48,600
[car engine roars up]

1385
01:24:56,533 --> 01:25:00,566
Why would I expect you to allow
me this one last courtesy?

1386
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:06,833
[car door opens and shuts]

1387
01:25:06,866 --> 01:25:09,500
Move, Mitch.

1388
01:25:09,533 --> 01:25:12,300
You're not leaving.

1389
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:16,333
Move.

1390
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:19,500
Stop it, stop.

1391
01:25:19,533 --> 01:25:22,866
[indistinct scuffle]
Liz: Son of a--

1392
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,333
[clattering]

1393
01:25:24,366 --> 01:25:27,033
You need help. Serious help.
Sick.

1394
01:25:27,066 --> 01:25:28,333
[Pistol lock slides open]

1395
01:25:28,366 --> 01:25:29,600
Hey!

1396
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:40,833
[Liz mouths] No.

1397
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,933
[Gunshot]

1398
01:25:45,066 --> 01:25:47,433
[Gunshots]

1399
01:25:47,866 --> 01:25:48,900
[Gunshot]

1400
01:26:09,966 --> 01:26:11,833
[gurgling sounds]

1401
01:26:12,933 --> 01:26:14,566
Is she dead or what?

1402
01:26:22,233 --> 01:26:26,433
[sirens wailing]

1403
01:26:34,666 --> 01:26:37,400
Cops: Freeze.
Don't move. Freeze.

1404
01:26:37,433 --> 01:26:40,633
All right, face down, Now.

1405
01:26:40,666 --> 01:26:44,133
Now!

1406
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:45,633
Hands behind your neck.

1407
01:26:57,133 --> 01:27:00,433
At his trial, Mitch Parker 
claimed to have no memory

1408
01:27:00,466 --> 01:27:05,666
of Liz's murder.

1409
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:11,600
Or ever having been married 
to a woman name Candy.

1410
01:27:11,633 --> 01:27:12,666
Yes?

1411
01:27:25,333 --> 01:27:27,600
Dr. Michael Reston 
testified that

1412
01:27:27,633 --> 01:27:29,733
Mitch suffered from 
depression

1413
01:27:29,766 --> 01:27:36,166
and Narcissistic 
Personality Disorder.

1414
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,700
Hello.

1415
01:27:37,733 --> 01:27:39,666
The signs of this disorder are:

1416
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:48,266
One, reacts to criticism 
with feelings of rage.

1417
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:54,466
Two, takes advantage of others 
to achieve his or her ends.

1418
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:58,866
Three, has a grandiose 
sense of self-importance.

1419
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:03,566
Four, has fantasies of 
unlimited success and power.

1420
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:09,400
Five, has a sense 
of entitlement.

1421
01:28:09,433 --> 01:28:14,200
Six, obsessions with 
wanting more and more.

1422
01:28:14,233 --> 01:28:20,366
Seven, desires to be associated 
with people of power.

1423
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,666
Eight, lacks empathy.

1424
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:28,000
Nine, preoccupation 
with self gratification.

1425
01:28:40,966 --> 01:28:46,566
Ten, requires constant 
attention and adoration.

1426
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,100
In Dr. Reston's 
professional opinion,

1427
01:28:49,133 --> 01:28:53,233
Mitch exhibited all ten 
of these symptoms.

1428
01:28:53,266 --> 01:28:56,100
[both sobbing]

1429
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,133
The jury deliberated 
for three hours

1430
01:29:02,166 --> 01:29:09,033
and returned a guilty verdict of 
murder in the first degree.

1431
01:29:09,066 --> 01:29:12,500
Mitch's parents 
did not attend his trial.

1432
01:29:17,933 --> 01:29:21,466
I came into this story 
at the very end.

1433
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:25,766
I only knew Liz Parker for
an instant.

1434
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:30,566
A simple errand. Picking
up a few boxes of books

1435
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:36,300
thrust me into the life of a
vital, beautiful woman.

1436
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:40,133
And I've become obsessed.

1437
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:42,066
How could this happen?

1438
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:46,166
How could a guy sucker so
many unsuspecting people

1439
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:49,000
for so long?

1440
01:29:49,033 --> 01:29:55,133
You think he couldn't
have suckered you?

1441
01:29:55,166 --> 01:30:01,900
Was Mitch parker insane?

1442
01:30:01,933 --> 01:30:04,966
I don't know.

1443
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,866
But when his 
extraordinary life fell apart,

1444
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:13,766
I believe he opted to 
become extra-ordinary

1445
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,400
in another way.

1446
01:30:17,633 --> 01:30:24,633
In fact, he became Sardis, 
Ohio's most infamous citizen.
