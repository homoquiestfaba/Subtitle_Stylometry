(gentle elegant music)

00:00:21,228 --> 00:00:26,228
(sneakers squeaking)
(girls yelling)

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,069
(bell tolling)

00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:44,152
(gentle elegant music continues)

00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,937

00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:52,804
(bell tolling)

8
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:56,887
(gentle elegant music continues)

9
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:06,163
- Hear oh Lord, when I cry with my voice.

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,100
Have mercy upon me and answer me.

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,800
When thou said, seek ye my
face, my heart said unto Thee,

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,963
Thy face Lord, will I seek.

13
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,793
The gospel of the Lord.

14
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,253
Let us pray.

15
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,483
Heavenly Father,

16
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,400
You sent Your own Son into this world.

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,450
We thank You for the
lives of these children

18
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,893
entrusted to our care,

19
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,493
that we are all Your children.

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,130
And so to love and nurture them

21
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,300
that they may attain to that full stature

22
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,723
intended for them in Your eternal kingdom.

23
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,833
For the sake of Your dear Son,
Jesus Christ, our Lord, amen.

24
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,023
Welcome to Saint Tammany's fall semester.

25
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,560
I do believe this is
the best looking group

26
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,603
we've ever had here.

27
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,090
St. Tammany, as they say is on a roll.

28
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,910
Enrollment has nearly doubled
in the last three years.

29
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,910
And as a result, we've had to
make a few slight adjustments.

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,490
Academically, St. Tammany
ranks right up there

31
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,970
in the top 5% of all private schools.

32
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,330
And in no uncertain
terms, academics will be

33
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,025
even more challenging yet more
rewarding than ever before.

34
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:43,880
(girls giggling)

35
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,790
The fifth chapter of Romans tells us

36
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,580
that tribulation brings
about perseverance,

37
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,300
perseverance proven character,

38
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,783
proven character hope.

39
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,963
Now,

40
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,160
because of the rigors of my schedule

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,313
I will no longer be coaching
the basketball team.

42
00:03:06,313 --> 00:03:08,740
- Ah.
(audience members clapping)

43
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,370
- Now, now, we were two and 10 last year,

44
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,500
it wasn't that bad.

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,400
So I'd like to introduce
to you the new coach,

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,477
coach Lootie Pfandder
has joined our staff.

47
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:18,227
(all applauding)

48
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,130
Expecting big things from you,

49
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,150
so I expect you all to
come out to the games.

50
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,410
Now, there will be an orientation

51
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,617
for the freshmen this afternoon.

52
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:29,784
(inspirational music)

53
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:33,529
(horn honking)

54
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:38,776
(inspirational music continues)

55
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:10,750
(ball hitting net)

56
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,741
♪ Yada da-da ♪

57
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:19,741
♪ Lada da-da-da da-da-da ♪

58
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,960
♪ Ya pum-pum-pum, ya ♪

59
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,300
Mornin' Missy.

60
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,340
- Mornin', you must be Sam.

61
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,030
- You'd be the new coach.

62
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,430
- Yes.
(Lootie laughs)

63
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,880
Hey, where's the locker room?

64
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,707
- We got this one and there's
one just on the other side.

65
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:37,925
- Great.

66
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:41,092
(disheartening music)

67
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,958
(doors clanging)

68
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:17,401
(metal clanging)
(balls thudding)

69
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:20,234
(Lootie laughing)

70
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,733
(Lootie sighs)
St. Tammany on a roll, huh?

71
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,483
Sure didn't waste any of it

72
00:05:28,483 --> 00:05:30,950
on the basketball facilities, did we?

73
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,017
- No, we didn't.

74
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,420
We blew our sports budget
on smallpox inoculations

75
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,063
for 3,000 yolly tribesmen.

76
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,360
Coach Pfandder, we're just a

77
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,470
small Episcopal girls' school here.

78
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,433
We do things a little differently.

79
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:54,530
(disheartening music)

80
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:00,444
(Lootie sighs)

81
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:05,980
(bright inspirational music)

82
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,085
- Hi, Laura.
- Nice to see you again.

83
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:08,918
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

84
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:10,085
- Hi, Bridget.

85
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:15,836
(bright music)
- Fine, fine, fine.

86
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:16,669
So fine.

87
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:18,539
- Come on.

88
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:22,065
Hey, everybody.
- Man.

89
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:23,846
- This is Shalonda, our new girl.

90
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:25,233
Shalonda, meet the girls.

91
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:28,138
This is Kimberly, Donna, Bridget.

92
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:32,062
(bright music)
- Show you how to, sit.

93
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:33,895
- A new mate?
- Ah-huh.

94
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,643
- You six foot?
- Six, one.

95
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,363
- Yeah, right?

96
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,580
What position you play?

97
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,453
- Post.

98
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,164
- You any good?

99
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:02,720
- Pretty good.

100
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,653
- Pretty good?

101
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,510
See this is Bridget over here,

102
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,680
we call her the bridge.

103
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,170
She blew out her knee last season.

104
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,890
She was the best Post player we ever had.

105
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,913
Are you good or are you great?

106
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,743
- I'm good.

107
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,450
- Did you get a scholarship?

108
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,463
Or did you just have rich parents?

109
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,920
- I got a scholarship.

110
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,753
- Oh yeah?

111
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,470
What was your point average last season?

112
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,493
- About 16.

113
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,460
- 16, and you got a scholarship?

114
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,134
- This is a little
tougher than junior high.

115
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:47,838
(ball thudding)
- Hey guys, take it easy.

116
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:52,289
- Shut up, wimp.
(bright music)

117
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:54,872
- Some iced tea.
- I'm famished.

118
00:07:55,753 --> 00:07:57,502
- Father Thomas, could you
bring me some more tea?

119
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:58,731
- Sure, wait there.

120
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:00,542
Stop, stop, stop.

121
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:03,410
Here you go, you're welcome.

122
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,832
- Thanks.
- Father Thomas,

123
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,977
you'd better sit down
and get something to eat.

124
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:08,106
- Yeah, come on, sit down, Father,

125
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:08,939
I'll go get you something to eat.

126
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,298
- No, you just go ahead and pour your tea.

127
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:11,400
Just don't worry about it.

128
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,776
I'm good, I'll eat as soon
as everyone is served.

129
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:14,609
- Please.

130
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,883
- Don't even look like you wanna be here.

131
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,060
What's your name again?

132
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,040
- Dunn, Kimberly Dunn.

133
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,670
- Oh, right, Kimberly Dunn.

134
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,080
Father Mulberry tells me
you're our star player.

135
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,030
You sure don't shine like a star to me.

136
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,540
Aren't you having any fun, Kimberly?

137
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,520
(Lootie sighs)
All right.

138
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,870
Front and center, let's go.

139
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,163
- Move over, wimp.

140
00:08:52,162 --> 00:08:53,800
(Lootie sighs)

141
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,180
- All right, Ms. Dunn, close your eyes.

142
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,163
I said close them.

143
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:06,370
Now when you were a little
girl, I bet you could run

144
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,023
and jump faster than any of
the other kids, boys and girls.

145
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:15,213
And you were probably
laughing and playing, playing.

146
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,733
because it was just a game.

147
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,170
Yeah, you were a tomboy, all right

148
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,720
but inside you wanted
to be a tiny, petite,

149
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,984
dainty, little ballerina, didn't you?

150
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:31,984
Daddy's little princess.

151
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:38,163
Do you remember what it was
like to really want something?

152
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,840
Give her the ball.

153
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,800
Now close your eyes,
Kimberly and see the basket

154
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,600
through the eyes of that little girl

155
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:53,213
and take that shot.
(dramatic music)

156
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:58,480
(ball thudding)

157
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,980
Thank you very much, Ms. Dunn.

158
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,553
Back in line.
- Good job.

159
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:03,386
- Goofy.

160
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,860
- All right, who's next?

161
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,563
- Can I try?
- Not yet.

162
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,433
Shalonda, come here.

163
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,540
Yeah, here, let me see, let me see.

164
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,083
Oh, nothing, nothing.

165
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,220
Can I tell you secret?

166
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,733
I really wanted to be a ballerina.

167
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,910
- Me too.
- Yeah?

168
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,743
- Yeah.

169
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,913
- Great.

170
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,937
Close your eyes.

171
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,407
Give me the ball.

172
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:38,740
You remember dancing
around your living room,

173
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,033
really feeling that music?

174
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:45,697
Okay, hear the music, Shalonda.

175
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:51,763
Whenever you're ready.
(gentle music box music)

176
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,012
(ball thuds)
(Lootie applauds)

177
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:57,420
Congratulations, that was beautiful.

178
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,480
- But I missed it.

179
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,240
- Yeah, you missed it by a mile

180
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,937
but you were focused and you
were committed from inside.

181
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,623
That's what I'm talking about, girls.

182
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,650
You have got to play big.

183
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,100
Look, you're gonna make shots

184
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,380
and you're gonna miss shots.

185
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,853
It's gonna happen anyway.

186
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,880
But if you play with God in your heart,

187
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,273
a smile on your face,

188
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,860
that, that inner strength.

189
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,160
That's what makes winners.

190
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,690
All right, I want you all to try this now.

191
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,910
One at a time.

192
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,844
Get back in line.

193
00:11:35,844 --> 00:11:38,712
(suspenseful music)

194
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:40,692
Woo! Ah, there we go!
(Lootie applauding)

195
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:41,567
All right.

196
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,900
Close your eyes.

197
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,541
(ball thudding)
It's okay.

198
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:50,178
Attagirl, attagirl.

199
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:58,237
Woo, ah, there we go.
(Lootie applauding)

200
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:02,265
(knocking on window)

201
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:15,048
Hey, you wanna see me?
- Have a seat.

202
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:19,261
(Father Thomas sighs)

203
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:28,703
(Father Thomas sighs)

204
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:31,703
I hope you haven't already unpacked.

205
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:36,781
- What?

206
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,680
- You were their coach,
you know how bad they are.

207
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,733
What was your record last year, oh and 12?

208
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:51,183
- Two and 10.

209
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,043
- Look,

210
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,783
you hired me to coach the
way I saw fit, was I wrong?

211
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,650
- I didn't know you were
going to be so creative.

212
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,483
- You're upset with me

213
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,600
for being a little too unconventional.

214
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,173
- That would be a fair statement.

215
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,300
Look, coach Pfandder,

216
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,233
we're just a small Episcopal
girls' school here.

217
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,560
- And you do things a little differently.

218
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,393
- Right?

219
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,360
- What do you want me to do?

220
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:27,530
Use your playbook?

221
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,633
- Excellent idea.

222
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,270
Just until you get your feet wet

223
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,217
and see how we operate here.

224
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:34,810
- Zones.

225
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,723
- Why yes.

226
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,980
I'm a big believer of play
in the zone, it's simple.

227
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,110
It works sort of like
Christianity, wouldn't you say?

228
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,793
On your resume, it did say you
were a Christian, didn't it?

229
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,593
- Yes.

230
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:54,339
But we already use the
same playbook for that.

231
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:57,339
(melancholic music)

232
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:08,287
(Lootie sighs)

233
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:18,620
(Lootie sighs)

234
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,620
(melancholic music)

235
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:36,330
Lord, are you sure this is where I belong?

236
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,050
I mean, what's with the zone business?

237
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,063
I can't work under these conditions.

238
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,803
I felt like I was being led here.

239
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,493
So, if this is where You want me,

240
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,500
this is where I'll stay.

241
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,754
just stick it out together?
(Lootie chuckles)

242
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:06,337
(upbeat music)

243
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:12,624
♪ This is what ♪

244
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:15,712
♪ This is what you need ♪
- Victoria.

245
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:16,647
- Ah-huh?

246
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:20,598
- You have to get them Rattigan
shoes out of my locker.

247
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:22,198
They're Pfandder' up everything.

248
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,371
- My shoes aren't stinky.

249
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:27,510
- Your shoes stink, your feet stink,

250
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,510
your breath stinks.
- Oh,

251
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,560
let's not get started,

252
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,580
who's the basketball player here?

253
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,249
- Yeah, but my feet don't stink.

254
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:37,363
You're stinkin' up the whole locker room.

255
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,082
- Okay.
(Victoria chuckles)

256
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:41,482
(phone ringing)
- Kimberly.

257
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:44,530
- I told you I recognized her.

258
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,513
- Recognize who?

259
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,309
- Coach Pfandder.
(phone ringing)

260
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:50,559
You know, Lootie?
- Yeah, Lootie.

261
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,020
How'd she get that name?
(Kimberly laughs)

262
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,580
- Kimberly, she was in All American.

263
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,138
- What kind of a name is Lootie?

264
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:58,980
- She was in All American.

265
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,850
- Yeah, right,

266
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,330
In All American?
- Oh, you don't believe?

267
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,281
- No, let me see that.
- See for yourself.

268
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:06,683
- You're such a liar.
(upbeat music)

269
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:09,167
I don't believe it.

270
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:12,786
- See, I told you.
- Stace, look at that.

271
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:14,610
- Let's see.

272
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,390
Man, she must've been something.

273
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,613
- What?
- Let me see that.

274
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,907
- Coach was in all American.

275
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:22,386
- Are you serious?
- I don't understand.

276
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:23,784
- Let me have that.

277
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,530
- I mean, why would she
come to St. Tammany?

278
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,454
- I don't know.
- Well,

279
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,000
maybe it was her best offer.

280
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,340
- Guys, maybe she just wanted to coach us.

281
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,306
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right.

282
00:16:32,306 --> 00:16:35,681
(Kimberly laughs)

283
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:38,542
I don't understand why
she wouldn't tell us this.

284
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,625
It's gotta be something else.

285
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,458
- [Kimberly And Victoria]
Jack, will there be

286
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,475
something else?
(girls giggling)

287
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:44,308
- Oh yeah.

288
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,030
Stop it.
(girls giggling)

289
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,961
I'm gonna find out, why'd
she hide that from us?

290
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:52,769
- I don't know, 'cause she don't like you.

291
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:55,348
- Oh, she don't like
you either, four eyes.

292
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,693
(girls giggling)
- Okay.

293
00:16:57,693 --> 00:17:00,165
- Stop!
(all laughing)

294
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:01,305
Watch the hat, watch the hat.

295
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:03,169
(bright trumpet music)

296
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:04,446
- [Announcer] And if
you're just now joining us,

297
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:06,156
we've got St. Tammany Episcopal

298
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:09,574
in the season opening
against the Lady Tigers.

299
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:10,407
For St. Tammany, it looks

300
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:12,473
like it's going to be a long night.

301
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:14,524
And a very warm welcome
for first year coach,

302
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:17,767
Lootie Pfandder who is a
second team on American NSE.

303
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:20,660
Kimberly Dunn, we had the St. Tammany team

304
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,580
in scoring last season,

305
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,903
was Dunn all the light with
14 points and seven rebounds.

306
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:28,486
(upbeat music)

307
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,070
Freshman, Shalonda Win,
playing the post tonight,

308
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,487
has eight points.

309
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,488
We're not disappointed in Coach Pfandder.

310
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:45,618
(crowd cheering)

311
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:48,651
- What are you doing in there, Shalonda?

312
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,460
You can't go skipping,
throwing in for a rebound,

313
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,782
are you listening to me?

314
00:17:51,782 --> 00:17:53,199
- Coach, come on.

315
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:59,112
- Come on, watch it!
(suspenseful music)

316
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,945
(whistle blowing)

317
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:07,868
Let's go, girls, come in here.
- Great going, Kimberly.

318
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:08,900
- Listen up, girls.
- Thanks, Sam.

319
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,110
- Can't we do something else?

320
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,120
We're getting hammered out there.

321
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,953
- No.
- Coach, send me in.

322
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:13,390
- Not now, Julia.

323
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,869
- Listen now, girls.

324
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:15,702
- Can we do something else?

325
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:17,363
Let's at least go man to man.

326
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,200
- We can't.

327
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,710
We're just gonna execute
the zone better, okay?

328
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,980
- Ah.
- Hey, listen up.

329
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,563
Anticipate the move, get
to the outside, okay?

330
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,303
Let's focus, girls, hands.

331
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,120
Ready?

332
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,953
- [Altogether] Team!

333
00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:39,640
- Come on.
(all applauding)

334
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,390
(birds chipping)

335
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,806
(bus engine roaring)

336
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,340
- Why'd you come out here?

337
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:56,040
- Well, St. Tammany is my calling.

338
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,680
Look, I know that being
this first-year coach,

339
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,270
people don't expect me to win.

340
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,103
I don't care.

341
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,485
- You don't care?

342
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:06,318
- No.

343
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,573
- You don't.
- No, I don't.

344
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,230
- Coach, I gotta tell you,

345
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,060
my folks, they live less
than 30 minutes away

346
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,643
and I can't even remember
the last time I was home.

347
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:26,880
See, my good Christian step mother decided

348
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,720
that she was just too young and attractive

349
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,040
to have a young girl
running around the house.

350
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,260
She was afraid all the
neighbors might think

351
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,423
I was her daughter.

352
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,343
So when I got stuck here,

353
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,340
the only thing that's kept me
going is playing basketball.

354
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,393
I ain't come here to get saved.

355
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,880
- What makes you think the
two can't go hand in hand?

356
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:55,210
(upbeat music)

357
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:26,566
(water splashing)

358
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:29,233
(ball bouncing)

359
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:41,905
- Hi.
(ball bouncing)

360
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:47,052
(ball bouncing)

361
00:20:55,107 --> 00:20:56,560
Actually, I thought
they looked pretty good

362
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,760
for the first term game.

363
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,310
- If you think that looks good,

364
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,360
I'd hate to see what you think looks bad.

365
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,020
(ball thudding)

366
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,393
Honestly, Father Mulberry-
- Call me Thomas.

367
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,863
- Thomas.

368
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,560
When are you going to turn me loose

369
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,851
on these girls and teach
'em some basketball?

370
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:23,518
(ball bouncing)

371
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,443
- Basketball?
- Yeah.

372
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,090
(ball bouncing)

373
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,113
- Basketball or something else?

374
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,233
Understand you took them
to an amusement park.

375
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:48,700
(ball thudding)

376
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,533
- So?

377
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,463
Look, I figured they needed
a little outside stimulation.

378
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,330
No offense, but St. Tammany is a little

379
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,653
like the bland leading the bland.

380
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,770
If these girls learn nothing else from me,

381
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,914
at least let them learn
how to have some fun.

382
00:22:06,914 --> 00:22:09,581
(ball bouncing)

383
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,460
- I don't need a 23 year
old hot shot blowing in here

384
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,200
making a lot of changes.
(ball bounces)

385
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,410
- That's right, I forgot.

386
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,170
St. Tammany is a small
Episcopal girls' school

387
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,597
and you do things a little differently.

388
00:22:24,597 --> 00:22:26,686
(ball bouncing)

389
00:22:26,686 --> 00:22:28,310
Why don't you do things
really different, Thomas,

390
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,983
and win a basketball game.
(ball bouncing)

391
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,913
- Coach Pfandder-
- Lootie.

392
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,053
- Lootie.

393
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,713
I think we should reconsider
our working relationship.

394
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,563
- Definitely.

395
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,943
I'm not so sure on what you had in mind.

396
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,500
- I'm not sure either.

397
00:22:56,013 --> 00:22:57,940
I mean, I wouldn't wanna put you

398
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,290
out on the street or anything.

399
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,590
I mean, what would you do?

400
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,970
- Hey, don't worry about me.

401
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,710
I got a job in broadcasting standing by

402
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,160
in case this didn't work out.

403
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,842
(ball bounces)

404
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,153
- You do?

405
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,033
- Yeah, I do.

406
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,713
- Well,

407
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,260
how do you think it's working out so far?

408
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,263
- I don't know.

409
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,623
- Well, do you think you're
gonna take this other job?

410
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:38,325
- I don't know.
(ball bounces)

411
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,670
- I see you're just sorta
keeping your options open,

412
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,600
is that it?

413
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:51,916
- Got that right.
(ball bouncing)

414
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:57,172
(adventurous music)

415
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:10,511
(adventurous music)

416
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:13,430
- [Announcer] St. Tammany
Episcopal is running

417
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,850
on the top rows last week

418
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,550
in the season opener
against the Lady Tigers.

419
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,210
New head coach Lootie Pfandder's looking

420
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,970
for her first win tonight
against a tough team

421
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,102
who won last week against Loyal.

422
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:27,102
(adventurous music)

423
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:34,699
(crowd cheering)
(adventurous music)

424
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,120
(crowd cheering)
(adventurous music)

425
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:49,403
(crowd cheering)
(adventurous music)

426
00:24:52,846 --> 00:24:57,846
(crowd cheering)
(adventurous music)

427
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,600
(crowd cheering)
(adventurous music)

428
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:32,750
(crowd cheering)
(adventurous music)

429
00:26:00,837 --> 00:26:05,837
(crowd cheering)
(adventurous music)

430
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:11,516
St. Tammany takes its final time outs.

431
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:12,490
- Hey girls,

432
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,350
You are playing one good game,

433
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:18,020
I'm so proud of you and
we've tied up the score

434
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,130
but they are tough

435
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,538
and they're gonna
continue to give it to us.

436
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:24,340
But we can beat them.

437
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,253
I know we can.

438
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,993
And don't forget girls,
it's just a goofy game.

439
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,550
All right, girls, bow your head.

440
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:41,003
Lord, we most reverently pray
for Your continued presence.

441
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,710
And we thank You for allowing us

442
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,143
to be healthy, strong athletes.

443
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,613
And we pray that we will play
for Your glory alone, amen.

444
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:56,363
- Amen.
- All right, ready?

445
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,863
- Team!
(upbeat music)

446
00:27:02,677 --> 00:27:07,677
(crowd cheering)
(upbeat music)

447
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:27,174
(upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

448
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:53,414
(vehicle whooshing)
(engine whirring)

449
00:27:56,683 --> 00:27:59,266
(gentle music)

450
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:11,843
(bell tolling)
(gentle music)

451
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:27,431
- I didn't get to sleep on the road.

452
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:29,484
- You didn't?
- No.

453
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:30,914
(both laughing)

454
00:28:30,914 --> 00:28:33,331
But you were out.
- I was out.

455
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:37,274
How embarrassing.
- It was cute.

456
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,683
- Why couldn't you sleep?

457
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:49,324
- I've had a lot on my mind.

458
00:28:49,324 --> 00:28:51,985
(dog barking)

459
00:28:51,985 --> 00:28:52,818
- Yeah.

460
00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:56,931
Yeah.

461
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:01,677
Me too.

462
00:29:04,903 --> 00:29:06,372
Look, you and I-
- I don't.

463
00:29:06,372 --> 00:29:07,237
- What?
- No.

464
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:09,654
- No, go ahead.
- No, please.

465
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,469
- I just wanted to let you know that,

466
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,450
I hope you'll stay.

467
00:29:24,273 --> 00:29:25,930
- I don't wanna go.

468
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,880
- You don't?
- No.

469
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,210
- Great.

470
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,190
- [Lootie] Yeah, great.

471
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,023
- Great.

472
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,923
Well, and I wanted you to know
also that as your employer,

473
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,150
I think we should maintain that.

474
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,270
Look. I know we don't
have a lot in common, but-

475
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,140
- I like you too.

476
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,897
Even though you're a little stuffy.

477
00:30:04,897 --> 00:30:06,230
(Lootie chuckles)
- Stuffy?

478
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,530
- Little, a little stuffy.

479
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,683
We'll work on it.
(both chuckling)

480
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:16,140
Look, you gotta let me
coach the way I wanna coach.

481
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,973
- I know.

482
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:18,260
- You gotta.
- I promise.

483
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,030
- [Lootie] Okay, okay.

484
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,650
- I can still come to
the games though, right?

485
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,800
- Yeah, but you gotta, all right.

486
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,893
- Look,

487
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,793
I mean, we must maintain.

488
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,027
- Yeah, yeah, right.

489
00:30:41,194 --> 00:30:42,643
(Lootie chuckles)
Yeah.

490
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,270
- [Altogether] One, two,
five, one, two, six, one, two.

491
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,972
- Just touch the ball, just touch it.

492
00:30:51,972 --> 00:30:53,631
Light pass, light passes.

493
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:56,381
(exciting music)

494
00:31:00,982 --> 00:31:02,994
Very good, girls, focus.

495
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,497
- [Altogether] One, one,
two, five, one, two, six,

496
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:08,897
one, two, seven, one, two, eight.

497
00:31:08,897 --> 00:31:10,314
Pick up, pick up.

498
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:15,434
All right, spot on, pulse.

499
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:16,972
Great job.

500
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:18,113
(whistle blowing)
(exciting music)

501
00:31:18,113 --> 00:31:22,412
- [Altogether] One,
two, three, four, five,

502
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:23,912
six, seven, eight.

503
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,574
- That's okay, stay with it, stay focused.

504
00:31:29,574 --> 00:31:32,628
- [Altogether] Five, six, seven, eight.

505
00:31:32,628 --> 00:31:35,127
- Watch what you're doing,
light pass, very good,

506
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,955
let's go, let's go, let's go.

507
00:31:36,955 --> 00:31:39,705
(exciting music)

508
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,073
- [Altogether] Five, six.

509
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:46,989
One, two.

510
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:48,934
One, two.

511
00:31:52,185 --> 00:31:53,602
Five, six, seven.

512
00:31:55,463 --> 00:31:57,046
One, two.
- Park it.

513
00:31:59,949 --> 00:32:04,162
(music drowns out Victoria)

514
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:05,937
(upbeat music)

515
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:07,807
- Focus.
- Focus.

516
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:09,159
- Focus.
- Focus.

517
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:09,992
- Focus.
- Keep your eye on the ball

518
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:11,356
at all times.
- Keep your eye on the ball

519
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:12,189
at all times.
- Keep your eye on the ball

520
00:32:12,189 --> 00:32:13,751
at all times.
- Keep your eye on the ball

521
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:15,435
pretty annoying.

522
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,885
You're a lousy, Father Thomas.

523
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:19,567
- You know I bet you are.

524
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:22,305
I don't see you as a star.

525
00:32:22,305 --> 00:32:24,585
- Oh, that was low.

526
00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:26,467
That was so low.

527
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:28,376
You sick little girl.
- Can you believe that?

528
00:32:28,376 --> 00:32:31,459
(gentle piano music)

529
00:32:33,613 --> 00:32:35,113
- Oh, yes, please.

530
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:38,649
- [Waiter] Would you like some more tea?

531
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:39,634
- No, thanks.

532
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:43,551
(gentle piano music continues)

533
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:46,883
What?

534
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,133
- What?

535
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,033
- What do you keep looking around for?

536
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,733
- Oh,

537
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:58,730
oh, no, it's nothing.
(Lootie chuckles)

538
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,103
- [Thomas] Okay.

539
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,065
- Aren't you afraid that
we're gonna be seen here?

540
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:10,232
- Should I be?

541
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:15,231
- I dunno, should you be?

542
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:17,029
- Lootie,

543
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,740
I'm an Episcopal priest.

544
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,340
It's okay if we go out and date.

545
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,960
We're not celibate.

546
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,274
(Lootie chokes)
You all right?

547
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:29,107
- Hmm-mm.

548
00:33:32,224 --> 00:33:35,304
- You ever think about getting hitched?

549
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,139
- I was engaged once.
- Really?

550
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:37,972
- Hmm-mm.

551
00:33:38,907 --> 00:33:41,653
It didn't work out.

552
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:44,856
What about you?

553
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,250
- My wife was killed in an
accident 12 years ago, December.

554
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,753
- I'm so sorry.

555

this season is hoping

558
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:17,867

(crowd cheering)
(upbeat music)

560
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:23,371
St. Tammany brings the ball up,

561
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:25,686
beautiful no-look pass to Stacy D

562
00:34:25,686 --> 00:34:28,307
who pulls up for a jump and nails it.

563
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:32,740
- And you guys, you're doing
a great job with man-to-man.

564
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,330
And Shalonda, you've
gotta stay with your girl,

565
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,210
I mean she's killing us on the inside.

566
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,117
- I know.
- And the rest of you,

567
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:40,870
you need a better upside defense

568
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,198
to help Shalonda.
- Come on, do it.

569
00:34:42,198 --> 00:34:43,276
- Okay?
- Sort it out.

570
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:44,986
You're doing great.

571
00:34:44,986 --> 00:34:45,819
(Lootie sighs)
- All right,

572
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:48,060
just stay focused, girls.

573
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,456
Be patient, let's take this one home.

Get in here.

578
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,300
Girls, We've gotta do a better job

579
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,710
protecting this basketball.

580
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,760
Amy, set a better pick for Kimberly

581
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,417
and then roll to the ball.

582
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:23,890
(girls clapping)
- Okay, girls, listen up.

583
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,950
All right, keep up with them.

584
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,513
- Donna, find your man
and then get it to her.

585
00:35:29,682 --> 00:35:34,130
We're doing fine, girls,
just relax and focus.

586
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,350
Remember what we've learned in practice?

587
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,450
- Put the pressure defensively

588
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,580
just keep doing what you're doing.

589
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,793
Now, we have to set up on the
offense, penetrate, Carrie.

00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,150
That's the least of your problems.

713
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,590
Police give you a ticket?

714
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,530
- Yes, sir.

715
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,893
- May I see it please?
- Yes, sir.

716
00:43:22,746 --> 00:43:25,579
(machine beeping)

717
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,800
- So your blood level's
below the legal limit.

718
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,633
- Yeah, but I wasn't drunk at all.

719
00:43:31,633 --> 00:43:33,243
- Don't make it worse for yourself.

720
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:36,630
And you were there?

721
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,463
- Yes, sir.

722
00:43:37,463 --> 00:43:39,050
- And you saw everything?

723
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,803
- I saw everything.

724
00:43:40,803 --> 00:43:41,636
- Okay.

725
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,970
I called in Dr. Leakage from the church,

726
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,670
I'm 'onna see what I can find out.

727
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,520
Don't you go anywhere, you understand me?

728
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,707
- Yes, sir.
- You come with me.

729
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,292
- I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

730
00:43:54,292 --> 00:43:55,125
- I know.

731
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,813
I know.

732
00:43:57,751 --> 00:43:59,483
- I didn't know it was gonna happen.

733
00:44:04,431 --> 00:44:06,764
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

734
00:44:07,889 --> 00:44:11,056
(footsteps pattering)

735
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,633
It's all my fault.

736
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,920
It's all my fault, you hear that?

737
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,910
- No.

738
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,280
- He knows it, it wishes it'd been me.

739
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,423
- Hey, hey!

740
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:31,860
Listen to me, she's gonna be all right.

741
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,222
- Oh yeah, wouldn't you know it?

742
00:44:34,222 --> 00:44:37,490
- I know it.

743
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:41,497
It's in the Lord's hands now,
you've gotta believe that.

744
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:44,952
Okay?

745
00:44:47,841 --> 00:44:48,873
Okay?

746
00:44:48,873 --> 00:44:50,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

747
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:53,908
(sirens wailing)

748
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:57,824
(Lootie sighs)

749
00:44:57,824 --> 00:45:00,574
(sirens wailing)

750
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,110
- [Bill] We're gonna run some tests.

751
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,319
I'll keep you informed.

752
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:07,402
- [Thomas] All right, thanks, Bill.

753
00:45:07,402 --> 00:45:08,569
- [Bill] Okay.

754
00:45:11,556 --> 00:45:12,630
(bell dinging)
- [Announcer] Dr. David

755
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,950
to telephone please, Dr.
David to telephone, please.

756
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,620
- [Lootie] What'd you find out?

757
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,453
- It's not good.

758
00:45:22,593 --> 00:45:25,460
(Thomas sighs)
Skull fracture.

759
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,523
She's unconscious.

760
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,550
And she broke her heel.

761
00:45:30,065 --> 00:45:30,898
- Okay.

762
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:38,003
Look, will you please go in
there and talk to Kimberly?

763
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,023
She's a mess.

764
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,580
- Did I ever tell you
how my wife was killed?

765
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,730
(melancholic music)

766
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,050
(footsteps pattering)

767
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,840
- Sam, where's Kimberly?

768
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,243
- She's in there.
(door squeaking)

769
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:11,032
(metal clanging)

770
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:13,623
- Heading out?

771
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,458
- Yup.

772
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:21,290
(Lootie sighs)

773
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:23,450
- Talked to the hospital today.

774
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,960
Julia is in stable condition

775
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,770
and the doctor says she's
got an excellent chance

776
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:28,783
of full recovery.

777
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,840
- If she wakes up.

778
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,843
- She'll wake up.

779
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:39,290
- How do you know, did you pray about it?

780
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:40,473
- You bet I did.

781
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,190
You know, if Julia was
here to give us her opinion

782
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,833
you know she'd want you to stay.

783
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:53,393
She really looks up to you.

784
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,263
Don't give up so easily.

785
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:02,023
Do it for Julia.

786
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,280
You wouldn't want her
to give up, would you?

787
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,223
- Of course not.

788
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,780
But she ain't got
anything to say about it.

789
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,163
You've heard Father
Mulberry, I'm off the team.

790
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:15,550
- Look, she might not have
anything to say about it

791
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,423
but I do.

792
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:19,650
- That's right.

793
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,230
I forgot you have Father Mulberry's

794
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,417
undivided attention, don't you?

795
00:47:25,832 --> 00:47:27,882
It's all right, everybody knows about it.

796
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:30,883
- Knows what, Kimberly?

797
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,083
Father Mulberry and I are friends, period.

798
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,510
(Lootie sighs)

799
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:45,753
Look, if he says you
can stay will you stay?

800
00:47:52,128 --> 00:47:52,961
- Look,

801
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,920
I don't fit in here, you
know that and I know that

802
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,870
and I've already made up my mind, okay?

803
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,583
I've caused everybody enough trouble.

804
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:18,480
- Have I ever told you
how much you remind me

805
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,150
of me when I was your age?

806
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,273
I wasn't a scrawny as you, but,

807
00:48:28,634 --> 00:48:31,801
I was the best player on the team too.

808
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,970
And it would just burn me up

809
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,610
when people would talk about teamwork.

810
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,210
You gotta work as a team,
but when it came down to it

811
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,373
and we were in a jam,
who did they look to?

812
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:49,343
You know, everyone thought
that I had it all together

813
00:48:50,956 --> 00:48:54,790
and everything going for me, but inside,

814
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,687
I was so uncertain and insecure.

815
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,793
- Until you found God?

816
00:49:04,238 --> 00:49:05,071
- Yeah.

817
00:49:08,057 --> 00:49:09,607
I didn't have to look very far.

818
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,433
Search your heart, Kimberly.

819
00:49:18,268 --> 00:49:20,851
(gentle music)

820
00:49:25,044 --> 00:49:26,144
- I've been searching.

821
00:49:29,127 --> 00:49:31,710
(gentle music)

822
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,033
Julia and your stupid shoes.

823
00:49:38,888 --> 00:49:41,471
(gentle music)

824
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:50,065
(phone ringing)

825
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,633
- You what?

826
00:49:56,187 --> 00:49:57,947
- You heard me.

827
00:49:57,947 --> 00:49:59,813
If she goes, I go.

828
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,010
- You're bluffing.

829
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,551
- Am I?

830
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:13,218
(phone ringing)

831
00:50:15,075 --> 00:50:17,658
(Thomas sighs)

832
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,483
- You sure are.

833
00:50:23,497 --> 00:50:25,597
Coach, Pfandder, I don't wanna let you go.

834
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:32,397
And I'm not just thinking about the team.

835
00:50:32,397 --> 00:50:34,980
(gentle music)

836
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,645
(machine beeping)

837
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,853
- Julia, can you hear me?

838
00:50:49,853 --> 00:50:52,810
(machine beeping)

839
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,710
You're the only girl I know
who could score cute guy

840
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:57,720
like Barney while you're
laid up and looking goofy

841
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,738
in a hospital bed.

842
00:50:59,738 --> 00:51:03,340
(machine beeping)

843
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,464
It's just not fair, you asked me to drive

844
00:51:05,464 --> 00:51:09,875
and I wouldn't let you drive.

845
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,853
Why'd you have to be such a wimp, huh?

846
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,883
Why'd you have to be such a wimp?

847
00:51:21,405 --> 00:51:25,180
Everybody loves you, everybody loves you.

848
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,993
Everybody loves you so much.

849
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,422
So why, it should be me
here, it shouldn't be you.

850
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:31,589
It's not fair.

851
00:51:33,163 --> 00:51:35,167
- [Announcer] Dr. David, telephone please,

852
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:37,500
Dr. David, telephone please.

853
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,232
- God, I just wish that we could help,

854
00:51:41,232 --> 00:51:44,859
I wish you would would smile for me.

855
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:46,477
I wish you could.

856
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:48,843
I'm sorry.

857
00:51:50,955 --> 00:51:52,885
I'm really, really sorry,

858
00:51:52,885 --> 00:51:53,993
I wish you knew how sorry I was.

859
00:51:55,593 --> 00:51:58,426
(machine beeping)

860
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,210
- You're Kimberly Dunn?

861
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,810
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, Kimberly.

862
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,373
This is Mr. Tumminello,
he's Julia's grandfather.

863
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,330
- You were driving the car?

864
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:12,230
- [Kimberly] Yeah.

865
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,643
- [Barney] I'll be out in the hall, okay?

866
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,113
- Look, I know,

867
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,343
all I can say is I'm sorry.

868
00:52:28,898 --> 00:52:30,298
- It was an accident, right?

869
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,823
Well, wasn't it?

870
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,470
Then that's fine.

871
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:40,423
Are you all right?

872
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,683
Me?
- Hmm-mm.

873
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:47,433
- I'm just fine.

874
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:53,113
I'm not the one laying there unconscious.

875
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,220
I just wish you could read the letters

876
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,220
Julia's been writing me.

877
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,510
I've often prayed that
Julia would find happiness

878
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:05,870
and she has, and as it usually is,

879
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,033
happiness is spiritual.

880
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,443
Julia's gonna be fine.

881
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,230
But how about yourself, Kimberly?

882
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,430
How are You going to be?

883
00:53:18,077 --> 00:53:20,660
(gentle music)

884
00:53:23,947 --> 00:53:26,270
- Girls, we need to just keep playing

885
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,620
like we're at practice.

886
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,590
Just 'cause your mom and dad
are out there taking pictures

887
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:33,883
of you, I don't want you all showing off.

888
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,483
We need to make the basket.

889
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,930
Keep movin' that ball.

890
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:44,793
Take the shot when you know you have it.

891
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:48,317
We need more points than
the other team to win.

892
00:53:48,317 --> 00:53:51,633
Enough!
(Lootie sighs)

893
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,510
- [Stacy] Coach, where's Kimberly.

894
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,560
- Yeah, where is she?

895
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,550
- Kimberly has been through
a lot since the accident.

896
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:16,340
And I think that maybe she's
gonna take some time off

897
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,640
from basketball right now.

898
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,830
Can't say that I blame her.

899
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,710
We're gonna miss her, there's
no doubt about that, but,

900
00:54:28,571 --> 00:54:30,323
we can still win this game.

901
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:36,930
That means that we have to play tougher

902
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:39,813
and harder and truly stay focused.

903
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,940
We have to play like a team more than ever

904
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,640
and let our thoughts and our
prayers be with Julia tonight.

905
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,887
I wanna dedicate this game to her.

906
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,934
Let's take a moment of silence.

907
00:54:58,934 --> 00:55:02,351
(crowd faintly cheering)

908
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:22,050
- This one's for Julia

909
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,183
- Amen.
- Amen.

910
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,060
- Welcome to tonight's presentation

911
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:31,620
of the RGV Times Classic
Tournament finals.

912
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,230
Tonight, they're defending
for a Texas State champion

913
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,360
and last year's tournament
winner, East Texas High,

914
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,730
brings an unbeatable record

915
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:42,470
into a contest with a
surprising, local favorite.

916
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,900
A Class 3A, St. Tammany
Episcopal girls' school,

917
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,120
a team who is so new to
competitive basketball,

918
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,319
they haven't even had
time to find a mascot.

919
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:54,229
(crowd cheering)

920
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:55,062
- Shoot!

921
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,353
(crowd cheering)

922
00:56:11,688 --> 00:56:12,889
- Why didn't you call me?

923
00:56:12,889 --> 00:56:13,921
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

924
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:14,900
- Well, I wouldn't miss
this for the world,

925
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,604
you know that I wouldn't.
- Ah, it's good to see you.

926
00:56:16,604 --> 00:56:17,437
- Look, can we do an interview?

927
00:56:17,437 --> 00:56:19,463
- Of course, yes.
- Here we go.

928
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:20,660
All right.

929
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,340
On the air.
- Yeah.

930
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:25,000
- I am standing here with
the St. Tammany coach,

931
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,820
Lootie Pfandder, coach,
surprise, surprise.

932
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,850
- Yeah, no kidding.

933
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:33,140
- Tonight, she gave the
East Texas team the shock

934
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,020
of their life.

935
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,000
Did you expect to win?

936
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,310
- Hey, look, we always play to win,

937
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,990
these girls have been
playing well all week

938
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,174
and Kimberly Dunn, did you see

939
00:56:39,174 --> 00:56:40,383
that three pointer?
- Amazing three pointer.

940
00:56:40,383 --> 00:56:41,857
- They have got the spirit now.

941
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,730
- And you showed it tonight.
- Yeah.

942
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:44,963
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

943
00:56:44,963 --> 00:56:47,449
- Thank you, thank you, cut.

944
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:48,282
- How was that?

945
00:56:48,282 --> 00:56:49,129
- Oh, it was good, it was good.

946
00:56:49,129 --> 00:56:50,520
It was good to see you,
am I gonna see you later?

947
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,020
- Of course, of course, I'm
just gonna do an interview

948
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:52,997
with the captain, but I'll see you,

949
00:56:52,997 --> 00:56:53,830
just go in the locker room,

950
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,473
I'll see you there.
- Go girl.

951
00:56:55,473 --> 00:56:58,223
(crowd cheering)

952
00:56:59,662 --> 00:57:02,662
(melancholic music)

953
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:19,311
(Thomas exhales)

954
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:22,311
(melancholic music)

955
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:35,314
- Hi.
- Hi.

956
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:39,040
Good game.
- Thanks.

957
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,037
- Here, let me get that.

958
00:57:41,037 --> 00:57:44,170
I'm gonna buy you the
biggest porterhouse steak

959
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,080
this side of Kansas City.

960
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,910
- Wow.
- Lou, there you are.

961
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:49,810
Honey, I've been looking all over for you.

962
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,220
Are you ready?
- Yeah, well.

963
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,053
- Oh, hi father.

964
00:57:52,053 --> 00:57:52,886
So what do you think of your new coach?

965
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,253
- Oh, it's just great.
- Oh, yeah, she is, great.

966
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:59,900
- I'm sorry, Father Thomas,
this is Carl Hastings.

967
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,040
- Hi there.
- Hi, pleasure.

968
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,040
- Carl and I are old friends.

969
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:04,873
- Good old friends.

970
00:58:04,873 --> 00:58:07,050
So, you ready, honey? Dinner.

971
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,980
- Right, oh, dinner.

972
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:09,813
- You two go ahead.

973
00:58:09,813 --> 00:58:11,340
Come with us.
- No, really.

974
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,720
- Sure. Come on, it's on me.

975
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,360
- Take a rain check.

976
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,753
Really, I'll talk to you after chapel.

977
00:58:15,753 --> 00:58:17,860
- Are you sure?
- I'll take that.

978
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,170
Well, let's go, Lou, bye, Father.

979
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:21,234
- Bye.

980
00:58:21,234 --> 00:58:24,234
(melancholic music)

981
00:58:28,692 --> 00:58:30,650
(door slams)

982
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:33,650
(melancholic music)

983
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,600
- Well, what he say?

984
00:58:44,113 --> 00:58:46,570
- He said it was a good sign.

985
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:49,170
- Barney, that's all he
said was it was a good sign?

986
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,100
- It's not all right, you
I'm sick of this garbage.

987
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,000
Now was supposed to go out

988
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,590
and I was supposed to win
a game for you and I did.

989
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:59,580
- She did.
- See?

990
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:02,688
The deal was you were supposed to wake up.

991
00:59:02,688 --> 00:59:05,021
You're supposed to wake up, Julia.

992
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:08,036
You're supposed to wake up.

993
00:59:08,036 --> 00:59:08,869
She was always such a wimp.

994
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:11,869
(suspenseful music)

995
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:19,436
- Who you calling a wimp?
- Julia?

996
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:21,691
- Julia?

997
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:32,164
- Hey, you.

998
00:59:32,164 --> 00:59:34,914
- What about me, you little wimp?

999
00:59:37,731 --> 00:59:38,564
- You wimp.

1000
00:59:38,564 --> 00:59:41,481
(victorious music)

1001
00:59:48,657 --> 00:59:50,413
- I'm gonna go find your grandpa.

1002
00:59:51,787 --> 00:59:54,850
(suspenseful music)

1003
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:56,260
- Okay.

1004
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,920
Hello, everyone, I'm Carl Hastings

1005
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,830
and I'll be play-by-play
announcer for tonight's contest

1006
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:04,030
which has a real David
versus Goliath flavor.

1007
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:05,550
And with home court advantage,

1008
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:08,800
the Southwood Lady Cowboys
bring the ball down court.

1009
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,730
Lady Cowboys are 10 and four this season

1010
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:12,694
with Trish Dixon number 32,

1011
01:00:12,694 --> 01:00:14,700
the Lady Cowboys point
guard working the ball

1012
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,723
down under and scores with a short triple,

1013
01:00:17,723 --> 01:00:18,973
pulling the southern team

1014
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,340
St. Tammany brings the ball up,

1015
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,123
works it around at the top of the queue

1016
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,725
over to Stacy Keen for a 12 footer, yes!

1017
01:00:29,725 --> 01:00:31,058
St. Tammany back on top (indistinct)

1018
01:00:31,058 --> 01:00:34,010
(crowd cheering)

1019
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:35,470
The Lady Cowboys bring it across the floor

1020
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,030
and get the ball down to their big center

1021
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:41,130
and she gets stopped by
the freshman, Shalonda Win

1022
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,941
of St. Tammany.

1023
01:00:42,941 --> 01:00:44,470
Andrews wield in a triple double

1024
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:45,795
in the last three games,

1025
01:00:45,795 --> 01:00:47,800
it's finally living up to her potential

1026
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,627
according to Coach Lootie Pfandder.

1027
01:00:50,627 --> 01:00:52,917
But it's number 23, post
guard, Kimberly Dunn,

1028
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:55,960
who has clearly established
herself as team leader.

1029
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,368
Rumors of Dunn quitting the team

1030
01:00:57,368 --> 01:00:58,669
after an automobile accident

1031
01:00:58,669 --> 01:01:01,008
that landed teammate Julia
Tumminello in the hospital,

1032
01:01:01,008 --> 01:01:02,939
apparently are unfounded.

1033
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:05,475
Much to the delight of St. Tammany fans.

1034
01:01:05,475 --> 01:01:08,058
(upbeat music)

1035
01:01:10,672 --> 01:01:15,672
(crowd cheering)
(upbeat music)

1036
01:01:16,544 --> 01:01:18,600
And they started to play
the Cowboys with the ball,

1037
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,472
brings it around and over to the forward

1038
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:21,512
for a spinning double.

1039
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:23,901
And Shalonda Win with another rebound.

1040
01:01:23,901 --> 01:01:27,062
Coach Lootie Pfandder might be
showing the wrong(indistinct)

1041
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:30,264
(crowd cheering)

1042
01:01:30,264 --> 01:01:31,693
St. Tammany with the ball.

1043
01:01:31,693 --> 01:01:33,223
Using their tricky stumble offense.

1044
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:36,339
Pass the ball down to
number 12 for Stacy Keen

1045
01:01:36,339 --> 01:01:38,301
Who shoots the jumper end.

1046
01:01:38,301 --> 01:01:39,134
It's foul.

1047
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,072
(crowd cheering)

1048
01:01:42,072 --> 01:01:43,091
Baskets wouldn't have counted

1049
01:01:43,091 --> 01:01:46,424
as a foul was committed before the shot.

1050
01:01:47,395 --> 01:01:48,228
- One shot

1051
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:54,295
(ball bouncing)

1052
01:01:56,565 --> 01:01:57,573
(ball thudding)

1053
01:01:57,573 --> 01:02:00,323
(crowd cheering)

1054
01:02:14,011 --> 01:02:17,091
- [Announcer] Southwood with
the ball and Southwood foul

1055
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:19,841
(crowd cheering)

1056
01:03:04,425 --> 01:03:06,857
- St Tammany scores.

1057
01:03:06,857 --> 01:03:08,337
(crowd cheering)

1058
01:03:08,337 --> 01:03:10,049
St. Tammany Scores again.

1059
01:03:10,049 --> 01:03:10,882
(crowd cheering)

1060
01:03:10,882 --> 01:03:13,658
First trial, this St.
Tammany team is amazing.

1061
01:03:13,658 --> 01:03:14,577
(crowd cheering)

1062
01:03:14,577 --> 01:03:16,398
- This one, no way.

1063
01:03:16,398 --> 01:03:17,889
This one this one, perfect.

1064
01:03:17,889 --> 01:03:18,722
- This one?

1065
01:03:18,722 --> 01:03:19,708
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1066
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:20,790
- Okay. Yeah.

1067
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,270
- It a paint , it got my name all over it.

1068
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:23,401
(Lootie laughs)

1069
01:03:23,401 --> 01:03:24,234
Whoa! Oh, boy.

1070
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:26,729
(Lootie laughs)

1071
01:03:26,729 --> 01:03:27,740
- Yeah.

1072
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,830
(Lootie laughs)

1073
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:32,580
What is with the hat?

1074
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:34,323
- What hat?

1075
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,708
- What hat?
(Lootie chuckles)

1076
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:37,541
That one on your head.

1077
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:38,748
- Oh, this hat?
- Yeah.

1078
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:39,956
Its cute.
- You like it?

1079
01:03:39,956 --> 01:03:40,789
- Yeah.

1080
01:03:42,408 --> 01:03:44,100
Would wanna to be a
cowboy when you grew up?

1081
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,162
- Yeah.

1082
01:03:45,162 --> 01:03:46,240
(Lootie chuckles)

1083
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,640
I thought I was Hoot Gibson.

1084
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:49,703
- Hoot Gibson?

1085
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:54,438
- Hoot Gibson. You don't
know who Hoot Gibson was?

1086
01:03:54,438 --> 01:03:55,640
- Ah.

1087
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:00,640
- Gibson was this great
big stuffy old cowboy.

1088
01:04:02,316 --> 01:04:03,966
(Lootie chuckles)
Well, it fits.

1089
01:04:05,867 --> 01:04:08,134
- So Lootie.

1090
01:04:08,134 --> 01:04:10,940
- Yeah.

1091
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:13,293
- You're serious about
this TV reporter guy?

1092
01:04:22,094 --> 01:04:23,274
(gentle music)

1093
01:04:23,274 --> 01:04:25,574
(crowd cheering)

1094
01:04:25,574 --> 01:04:26,636
- [Announcer] And here the ball gone,

1095
01:04:26,636 --> 01:04:28,065
St.Tammany team is at it again.

1096
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:30,815
(crowd cheering)

1097
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:41,772
- They bring the ball on
court, no the ball just trip,

1098
01:04:41,772 --> 01:04:43,412
once again is Kimberly Dunn and it's

1099
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:46,662
another easy basketball for
the team from St. Tammany.

1100
01:04:46,662 --> 01:04:50,745
(crowd cheering and applauding )

1101
01:05:12,805 --> 01:05:16,556
And the ball goes to freshman
sensational, Shalonda Win.

1102
01:05:16,556 --> 01:05:18,973
It's in and that's 26 points.

1103
01:05:20,089 --> 01:05:22,839
(crowd cheering)

1104
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:30,116
- Can I get an interview right now?

1105
01:05:30,116 --> 01:05:30,949
- Sure.

1106
01:05:33,824 --> 01:05:35,613
- Stand by everybody. Quiet on the set.

1107
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:38,973
Roll tape.

1108
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:45,820
Here we go.

1109
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:49,433
In five, four, three, two.

1110
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:53,320
- So here we are.

1111
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,900
- Here we are.

1112
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,300
- Tell me, coach, what was
the point that you realized

1113
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,000
that your team was special?

1114
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,960
When did you first realize

1115
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,370
that you were headed for
the state championship?

1116
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:05,800
- Well, one day we were
practicing our free throws

1117
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,530
with our eyes closed.

1118
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,760
- With your eyes closed?

1119
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,360
- It's like I told you,
practicing with faith.

1120
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,410
Believing in oneself and
all the possibilities.

1121
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:19,763
We just take it one at a time.

1122
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,970
- Now your team doesn't have a mascot

1123
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:25,010
but you have been dubbed
the St. Tammany Miracle.

1124
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:27,630
And I understand that you
particularly don't care for that.

1125
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:29,290
- No, I don't.

1126
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:33,323
I mean it belittles our team's
athletic talent and efforts.

1127
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,450
We will and do accept any

1128
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,470
and all help that might come our way.

1129
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,140
- Well, be that as it may,
it's been nothing short

1130
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,450
of miraculous the way that
you've taken this team

1131
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:44,960
from nowhere to where they are now.

1132
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,600
- We are on a roll, all right?

1133
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,990
But it's not a miracle.

1134
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:51,450
It's good old fashioned
work and fundamentals

1135
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:54,550
and ideals and a strong foundation

1136
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:57,930
in belief in something
higher and bigger than us.

1137
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,190
- Yeah, I know not
everyone could take a team

1138
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:02,890
that was two and 12 and a
district a year ago to this level.

1139
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:04,513
You have done the impossible.

1140
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:07,190
You don't have the height
except for Shalonda Win

1141
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,270
and she's a freshman and
you don't have the speed

1142
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:11,520
except possibly in your
top scorer, Kimberly Dunn.

1143
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,780
And I couldn't characterize
her as having blazing speed.

1144
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:18,927
- No, but Kimberly just
knows how to beat you.

1145
01:07:18,927 --> 01:07:20,975
I think it's called heart.

1146
01:07:20,975 --> 01:07:22,963
- I think they call it
the St. Tammany Miracle.

1147
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,640
And moving on, coach Pfandder,

1148
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,430
a personal question if you don't mind.

1149
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:29,380
- No, I don't mind.

1150
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:32,190
- The rumors are running rampant Lou

1151
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,836
and the suspense is killing me.

1152
01:07:33,836 --> 01:07:36,270
It is no secret that several
schools are interested

1153
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:40,290
in you as well as a one sports
network that I can't mention

1154
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:43,290
but Lootie right here
on television right now.

1155
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:44,920
Tell us what you're gonna
do after the season's over.

1156
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,560
I understand that your contract

1157
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,390
might not be picked up by St. Tammany.

1158
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:50,279
- It's not about contracts.

1159
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:53,720
It's about believing in something.

1160
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,210
Whether Father Mulberry
renews my contract.

1161
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:59,693
Well, I'll pass that
bridge when I burn it.

1162
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,783
- And cut.

1163
01:08:04,783 --> 01:08:06,101
Beautiful.Beautiful.

1164
01:08:06,101 --> 01:08:08,823
- Thank you.

1165
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:09,656
- Great.

1166
01:08:09,656 --> 01:08:11,060
- Thanks. It's all right.

1167
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:11,893
- Good.

1168
01:08:15,851 --> 01:08:18,434
(gentle music)

1169
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,092
- Wow!
- That's hot.

1170
01:08:28,092 --> 01:08:29,259
- That is hot.

1171
01:08:31,612 --> 01:08:34,220
(gentle music)

1172
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:35,053
- [Lootie] Thank you.

1173
01:08:35,053 --> 01:08:36,053
- Thank you.

1174
01:08:37,231 --> 01:08:38,441
(gentle music)

1175
01:08:38,441 --> 01:08:40,420
- Are you sure?

1176
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,337
Whoa! Whoa!

1177
01:08:43,893 --> 01:08:45,900
So this religious thing,

1178
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,670
it sort of made you a
miracle worker, is that it?

1179
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:52,209
- No, Carl, once again,
you're missing the point.

1180
01:08:52,209 --> 01:08:53,249
- Am I?

1181
01:08:53,249 --> 01:08:55,210
- Yeah. I don't like it.

1182
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,380
We're not a miracle team.

1183
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,920
We're a basketball team.

1184
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,320
And we've worked really
hard to get this far.

1185
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,030
- Who happens to be leading the conference

1186
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:03,880
on a wing and a prayer.

1187
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,912
- Right.

1188
01:09:04,912 --> 01:09:06,248
- Right.

1189
01:09:06,248 --> 01:09:08,733
- Look, don't exploit us.

1190
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,120
It's not fair to my girls

1191
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,390
and it's not fair to my personal beliefs.

1192
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:15,650
- Why are you being so blatant about it?

1193
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:16,483
- Frankly, Carl,

1194
01:09:16,483 --> 01:09:18,480
I don't think we're being blatant enough.

1195
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,430
Look, we're a small
private Episcopal school

1196
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:24,330
and we do things a little differently.

1197
01:09:27,905 --> 01:09:31,330
Do things a little differently.

1198
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:32,671
- You have people thinking

1199
01:09:32,671 --> 01:09:35,310
that your team can just walk on a water.

1200
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,083
It is this religious thing.

1201
01:09:38,698 --> 01:09:39,531
And that is why I'm...

1202
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:42,100
If you remember correctly
that we didn't get married.

1203
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:46,550
You said you that you
couldn't fully love someone

1204
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,053
who didn't share your faith.

1205
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:51,570
I never claimed to share your faith

1206
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:54,380
but neither did I criticize or
interfere with your beliefs.

1207
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,740
- You don't think it's interfering

1208
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:58,650
by exploiting this miracle angle.

1209
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:00,470
I mean what am I supposed to tell my girls

1210
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:01,420
when you tell them that all

1211
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:04,043
their hard work is some
sort of hocus-pocus.

1212
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:06,230
- Tell him I love you.

1213
01:10:07,921 --> 01:10:09,721
Tell him I never stopped loving you.

1214
01:10:11,192 --> 01:10:13,775
(gentle music)

1215
01:10:17,852 --> 01:10:20,519
(air whooshing)

1216
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:24,523
- Okay.

1217
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:28,340
In five, four, three, two.

1218
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,980
Hello, everyone. I'm Carl Hastings.

1219
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,700
And I'll be your play by play announcer

1220
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,900
for tonight's contest.

1221
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,410
Not only has the Nichols high
team been extremely successful

1222
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:39,670
over the past few years in this tournament

1223
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:42,900
but there's an added drama
to the picture tonight.

1224
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,530
They are riding a 56 game
winning streak which has spanned

1225
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:49,900
over two years and they can
establish a new state record

1226
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,770
with their 57th straight win

1227
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,980
if they can gain a victory tonight.

1228
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:57,030
But standing in their way
is the St. Tammany team,

1229
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:59,910
a small team, which no one
expected to win 10 games

1230
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:03,560
a season, much less, make
it to the state finals.

1231
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,250
They have ridden the shoulders
of star, Kimberly Dunn

1232
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:08,140
and freshmen Shalonda Win

1233
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,810
who together have combined four 50%

1234
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:13,530
of the team's points and
most of the rebounding.

1235
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:17,160
But everyone is wondering
if new coach Lootie Pfandder

1236
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,330
and her St. Tammany team
has run out of miracles.

1237
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:22,873
We'll see right after this brief message.

1238
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:28,350
- Ladies we're gonna win this game

1239
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,800
'cause we're the better team.

1240
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,680
We're bigger, we're faster

1241
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:36,743
and we've been there a lot.

1242
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,880
You've played better teams
than this in junior high.

1243
01:11:44,048 --> 01:11:45,100
- Did you see 'em guys are huge.

1244
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,300
- Hey guys, we can do it.

1245
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,030
- But did you see "em? They're giants.

1246
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:49,503
- Did you see the size of number 13?

1247
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,820
- It's a monster.

1248
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,670
- Okay. They're big, but we can do it.

1249
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:57,170
- Hey girls, this team is
gonna give us all we can handle

1250
01:11:57,170 --> 01:12:00,580
and then some, have to find out

1251
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:03,313
if we have learned what
it takes to be champions.

1252
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,810
- Now, you've seen the game film.

1253
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,400
They've got one hot shot

1254
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:13,264
then we're gonna take her out, right?

1255
01:12:13,264 --> 01:12:15,014
- [Altogether] Right.

1256
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:20,130
- Don't forget where we've
come from to get here.

1257
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:23,693
All the hard work, all the sacrifices.

1258
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:27,670
We have the power to
make things go our way

1259
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:29,793
and we will make things go our way.

1260
01:12:32,143 --> 01:12:33,943
- I don't want you to just beat 'em.

1261
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,540
I want you to humiliate 'em.

1262
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,740
I want you to kick that.

1263
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:40,900
(coach chuckles)

1264
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,163
I want you to crush them.

1265
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,490
- I hard off the back
boards, even up the brakes

1266
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:50,393
and girls, remember,

1267
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,600
it's just basketball game.

1268
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:55,970
All right take a knee.

1269
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,163
Father.

1270
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:04,760

1271

for all that you have done for us.

1272
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,760
- And these people stand
for everything I'm against.

1273
01:13:10,941 --> 01:13:12,983
I wanna teach these, do gooders a lesson.

1274

We also thank you for
those disappointments

1282
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:43,303
and failures that lead us

1283
01:13:43,303 --> 01:13:46,370
to acknowledge our dependence on you alone

1284
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:52,230
