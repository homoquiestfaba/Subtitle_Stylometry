1
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:11,236
There is no chance.

2
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:14,268
no destiny...

3
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:17,902
no fate.

4
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:22,503
There's only
what you take from the world

5
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:24,834
and what
the world takes from you.

6
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:58,069
I miss you...

7
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,834
you know?

8
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:08,737
Sometimes I think about
the way you were,

9
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,102
the way
you treated me,

10
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:16,770
the good times,

11
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:19,267
the bad times.

12
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:25,534
And I just wish I could have
another chance at things.

13
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:32,234
Stop me if you've
heard this one before.

14
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,702
You will always be my girl.

15
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:41,801
Karl?

16
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:44,966
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

17
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,000
No, I'm fine.

18
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,768
We've been
through all this before.

19
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,099
Are those for Mommy?

20
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,133
Yeah.

21
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,068
Did you pick them?
Mm-hmm.

22
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:56,001
They're pretty.

23
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,599
Nikky's bag's
in the car.

24
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,200
I can go grab it
if you two want to be alone.

25
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:04,501
Actually, I wanted to...

26
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:07,899
I meant to ask you,

27
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:11,102
do you think maybe you could
keep her till tomorrow?

28
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,233
But, Daddy,
you promised.

29
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:13,600
I got something
I need to take care of.

30
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,201
I know, baby.
Look, I'm sorry.

31
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:19,401
I'll make it up to you.

32
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:21,033
Please.

33
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:22,033
Just this once?

34
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:23,500
Oh, it's not a problem.

35
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:24,767
But can we.

36
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:28,769
Hey, Nikky,
did you want to play something?

37
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:29,966
Do you want to play
Marco Polo?

38
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,501
Yeah.
Go on.

39
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,633
So what's going on?

40
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:38,933
Is it something
at the hospital?

41
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:41,101
Something like that,
yeah.

42
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,302
I'm worried about you.

43
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:45,733
I'm doing better
and better

44
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,767
Daddy, I'm ready.

45
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:48,999
Marco.

46
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,066
Polo.

47
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,867
Yet we always seem
to find you here.

48
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:56,335
I like to come visit.

49
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,435
You know, I like to tell her
what I've been up to.

50
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:00,967
I just...

51
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,468
Nikky's been making
so much progress.

52
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:05,634
Come on, Daddy!

53
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,633
Marco.

54
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,367
Polo!

55
00:06:08,432 --> 00:06:14,104
I feel like coming here
sets her back a little, you know?

56
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,901
Seeing you like this,
I think she worries,

57
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:18,301
after what
her mother did,

58
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:21,768
that you, if you got
depressed enough, might...

59
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:22,966
Never.

60
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,034
Look, I love Nikky
more than anything in the world.

61
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,601
Nothing's going
to happen to her.

62
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,135
Nothing.
I promise.

63
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Marco.

64
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,199
Polo!

65
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:33,599
I'll bring her by
at 2:30 tomorrow.

66
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,600
Great.

67
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,100
Sharp.
Sure.

68
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,199
Boo!

69
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:45,135
See you tomorrow, okay?

70
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,700
Dr. Lewis, call ER stat.

71
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,565
Dr. Lewis, call ER stat.

72
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:50,268
Dr. Lewis, call ER stat.

73
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:08,666
Miss Matera?

74
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:09,966
I want to see her.

75
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:14,504
Yeah, Claudia,
you will.

76
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:16,801
I just think we should
have a word first.

77
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:19,201
Okay, tell me.

78
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:20,666
We did our best,

79
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,733
and the operation
was successful,

80
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:26,969
but with patients her age,

81
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:30,703
the body just can't
handle the stress.

82
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:33,101
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,902
At this point,
it's a matter of time.

84
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:07,433
Hey.

85
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:08,766
Hi, Karl.

86
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:11,100
Listen, just to confirm,
we do need you tonight.

87
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,100
What about Dr. Stark?

88
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,301
He asked for a day off.

89
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:15,532
Again?
Jesus Christ.

90
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,733
That guy takes more days off...

91
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,400
I know,
But we need you, Karl.

92
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:20,967
I know, but I can't.
I physically can't.

93
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,768
You know, I'm sorry,
but I'm not on call.

94
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:23,933
You're out of the city?

95
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,166
I've got something
I have to do.

96
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,199
Something you have to...

97
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,633
Yeah, something
for my daughter.

98
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,200
Yeah, okay, Karl.
Well, thanks anyway.

99
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:30,232
I'm sorry to bother you.

100
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:34,236
Okay, bye.

101
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:32,433
Oh, hello, ladies,
let me give you...

102
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:34,200
Here, let me help you
with some of that stuff.

103
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:35,499
Oh, thank you so much.

104
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,534
You heading away
for the 4th of July, Miss Maurie?

105
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,200
Oh, they're
turning us out again.

106
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,433
Units ready,
units not ready,

107
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:42,466
this building.

108
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,100
Okay.

109
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,935
Can you manage?

110
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,066
Good-bye, Lana.

111
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,100
Bye. Thank you.

112
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,400
Good-bye, Karl.

113
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:54,400
Chloe. Hey.

114
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:55,732
Thanks.

115
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,267
And stay out of the heat,
ladies.

116
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:58,766
Oh, I will.

117
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:31,767
That's comforting.

118
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:55,701
You know,
they don't always open.

119
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:57,400
I've seen
some nasty accidents.

120
00:12:57,465 --> 00:12:58,599
Yeah,
I'll keep that in mind.

121
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:35,735
Okay, what did you hit, kid?

122
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,733
I didn't hit anything.

123
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,433
I'm kidding.

124
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:41,101
We'll be up and running
any second now.

125
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,734
Any second now.

126
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,134
Told you
it didn't sound good.

127
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,401
It could be a silent alarm.

128
00:14:39,465 --> 00:14:41,066
We're not in a bank.

129
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:42,100
I have my phone.

130
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:49,066
There's no service.

131
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,701
Yeah, I probably shouldn't
use any more minutes anyhow.

132
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,633
That's clever.

133
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:02,766
Lighten up, kid.

134
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:03,866
Look, I got somewhere to be,
okay?

135
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,200
Well, I don't,
you know?

136
00:15:05,265 --> 00:15:07,200
I was actually hoping
this might happen.

137
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:09,000
God, Christ,
my life is empty.

138
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:17,768
I have just captured
the perfect image of angst.

139
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:19,266
Erase the picture.

140
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:20,266
Why?

141
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:21,499
Just do it.

142
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:24,300
Just fuckin' do it.

143
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:28,400
Okay?

144
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:47,633
She needs it.

145
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:48,900
Hurry.

146
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:09,766
Claudia?

147
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:15,268
Claudia,
where did you put them?

148
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:16,433
Put what?

149
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,033
Oh, don't be
coy with me.

150
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:19,967
They were right here.

151
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,935
I don't go around
hiding your asthma inhaler.

152
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:30,603
My inhaler's not gonna kill me.

153
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,234
50 years from now,
who knows?

154
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:33,633
Mm, scientists.

155
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:34,633
There you go.

156
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:44,534
Aren't you going to join me?

157
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,566
No, I can't.

158
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:46,966
I have a to-do list
a mile long.

159
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:49,568
I should have never
gone to bed last night.

160
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:57,202
Are you going out
like that?

161
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,634
I left my black veil
at the cleaners.

162
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,902
I want more skin,
not less.

163
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:05,134
We live on the beach.
What are you, a nun?

164
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,635
Yes, Abuela,
I am a nun.

165
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,802
When I was your age,
I set this town on fire.

166
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:13,300
Let's go to the beach.

167
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,567
Uh-uh.
I can't.

168
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:17,000
Mid-terms
start next week.

169
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:20,967
Life is for living.

170
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:22,100
I know. I know.

171
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,100
I'm trying to do that.

172
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,200
I just...

173
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:25,799
have to take care
of some stuff first.

174
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,602
Listen, I love you,
so don't take this the wrong way,

175
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,635
but you
are starting to suck.

176
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:37,034
If you don't break,
you'll bend.

177
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:40,902
Isn't it, if you don't bend,
you'll break, I think?

178
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,768
No, no.
No, it's not.

179
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:48,703
I mean, if you don't start
taking breaks and breathe,

180
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:52,169
you'll mist
into someone really horrible.

181
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:54,901
Okay, we'll go
to the beach,

182
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:57,234
just for a little while.

183
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:16,802
Keep Calm.

184
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:20,302
You are not in danger.

185
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:24,000
Got any water
in here, dude?

186
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,400
In most cases,

187
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:29,535
the elevator mechanic
will arrive in 3O minutes.

188
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,968
O1:38
and counting.

189
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,933
Hey.

190
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,066
Hey.

191
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,267
Where you going?

192
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:02,500
Where do you think?
The ladies bathroom.

193
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,601
You look good tonight.

194
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:13,035
I think your friends...
I think they're leaving.

195
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,135
I think
we're at floor level.

196
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,068
What do you think?

197
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:42,035
Yeah, it's worth a look.
Yeah.

198
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,900
Be careful.
Be careful.

199
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:47,600
Hey, can you
give us a hand?

200
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,534
What do you expect me to do?
My hands are sweaty too.

201
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:50,900
Maybe you'll let me see that.

202
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:57,433
Shit.

203
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,233
You always carry this
around with you, kid?

204
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:04,600
A lot of dangerous people
out there.

205
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:14,601
Oh, shit.

206
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,966
Somebody help!

207
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,367
Hello?

208
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:24,432
Help!

209
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:25,967
Can anybody hear us?

210
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:27,501
Shh. Do you hear something?

211
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:29,301
I don't hear
anything at all.

212
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:31,934
Hello?

213
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:34,568
Hello!

214
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:37,234
We need help
with the elevator.

215
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:37,266
Let it go on three.

216
00:21:37,332 --> 00:21:40,168
One, two, three.

217
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,767
Shit.

218
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:44,033
Somebody must've heard us.

219
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:45,500
This building
is empty, man.

220
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:47,134
Even the freaking
Golden Girls are gone.

221
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,035
Wait.
Who else lives in the building?

222
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,934
There's got to be...
there's that couple, right?

223
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:53,067
They have a newborn baby.

224
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:54,834
People don't go
on vacations with babies.

225
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:55,899
Really?

226
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:57,167
Have you been
on an airplane lately?

227
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,466
Hey, we're
all in this together.

228
00:21:58,532 --> 00:21:59,633
You don't have
to be an asshole.

229
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:01,300
So I can't even
disagree with you?

230
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:02,299
My God,
what a fascist.

231
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:04,567
That's not...
... Look!

232
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:05,666
Let's calm down, okay?

233
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:10,566
With this heat wave,

234
00:22:10,632 --> 00:22:13,401
every air-conditioner
in the city's running.

235
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:14,732
It's a blackout.

236
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,867
Well, then, that means the power
should be back on soon.

237
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:18,401
Well, the one a few years ago
lasted almost mo days.

238
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:19,933
Someone died
in a fucking elevator.

239
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:20,933
They died?

240
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:22,066
It's not a blackout.

241
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,534
How do you explain
the emergency lights?

242
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,866
It's a back-up generator, genius.

243
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:26,934
My hospital
has a back-up generator.

244
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:28,867
Banks have
back-up generators.

245
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,134
Well, what if
the elevator's broken?

246
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,134
Huh?

247
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,167
Wait, wait, wait.

248
00:22:32,232 --> 00:22:33,800
How many units have been rented?

249
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:36,699
I think it's,
like, half finished.

250
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:38,134
Half finished?

251
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,103
There's five.

252
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:45,567
Well, there's
okay, this is three.

253
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,233
You live with
your parents, right?

254
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,233
Where are they?

255
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:49,333
I don't know. Aruba.

256
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:51,134
Okay, Maurie sisters.
That makes four.

257
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,135
And the couple who are staying
with their relatives

258
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,634
while they're having
their plumbing redone.

259
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:56,133
They got a baby in tow.

260
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,801
That makes five.

261
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,068
This could be a while.

262
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,567
Shit.

263
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:38,799
It's a gateway drug.

264
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:40,667
You got to start somewhere.

265
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:27,869
Tom?

266
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,100
I wanted
to ask you something.

267
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,935
Someone told Olivia
at school that

268
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:36,634
last year, you were banging Eve,

269
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:38,567
among others.

270
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:49,636
Sometimes I just worry
that you do this with everyone,

271
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:55,071
that your promises,
things you say...

272
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:57,902
I don't think
it's an act, but...

273
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:12,201
Help us!

274
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:13,833
I need
to get out of here!

275
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:14,833
Don't yell!

276
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:16,100
Help!
Oh, God!

277
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:17,133
Tommy, calm

278
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:20,334
Hey, listen,
calm down.

279
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:21,666
Hey, calm down.
Calm down.

280
00:25:21,732 --> 00:25:22,699
No, get off me!

281
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,034
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.

282
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:38,033
You motherfucker.

283
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:39,133
I'm really sorry.

284
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,100
Oh, Jesus,
let me get a look at that.

285
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,133
Please.

286
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:44,033
You got to keep
pressure on the lip.

287
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,266
Without ice,
that's going to swell.

288
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:46,299
Get off me, man!

289
00:25:46,365 --> 00:25:47,332
Hey, stop yelling.

290
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:48,333
Don't tell me what to do!

291
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:49,500
Calm down.

292
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:51,301
Look, I have got
somewhere to be, and if this

293
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:54,468
We all do!
We all do!

294
00:25:54,532 --> 00:25:59,904
Okay, the air is getting
really thin in here, okay?

295
00:26:00,866 --> 00:26:02,634
We need to relax.

296
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:05,301
We need to think logically, okay?

297
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,866
Let me get that knife.

298
00:26:24,732 --> 00:26:26,700
Okay.

299
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:30,400
The mountains it ain't,

300
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:32,433
but it's not bad.

301
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:49,103
I know I didn't know you then,
and I shouldn't care, but...

302
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:51,501
Look. Eve.

303
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:53,100
it was a drunk thing.

304
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,935
It was once.

305
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:57,166
And you...

306
00:26:57,232 --> 00:26:59,901
You're pretty much
the only right choice

307
00:26:59,966 --> 00:27:02,768
I've ever made
in my life.

308
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:03,999
And you know that l

309
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:05,367
Francesca!

310
00:27:05,432 --> 00:27:07,400
Shh.

311
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:09,200
Francesca?

312
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:10,566
Fuck. It's early.

313
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:12,600
He must've lost.
He must've lost bad.

314
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:14,367
Lost at what?
Cards.

315
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:15,399
Get dressed.

316
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:18,600
You never told me
your father gambles.

317
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,734
Doesn't everyone?

318
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,966
Did you put it somewhere?

319
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:23,734
Where is the mail?

320
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:24,799
I mean,
are you going to be okay?

321
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:28,970
One fucking thing for me,
and you can't even do that.

322
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:30,067
Francesca!

323
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,634
You said your father
was an accountant.

324
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:32,666
You said he never drinks.

325
00:27:32,732 --> 00:27:33,999
He's not,
and he does.

326
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,367
I'll tell you the rest
of the gory details later,

327
00:27:35,432 --> 00:27:36,766
but right now,
you need to get out.

328
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,367
I'm the only one that can
calm him when he loses.

329
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:41,667
He can't stay mad
at his little girl.

330
00:27:43,766 --> 00:27:44,733
Go.

331
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,767
Hey.

332
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:21,966
Hey.

333
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,501
Hey, sorry
to sneak up on you.

334
00:28:23,566 --> 00:28:25,367
Just
Who the fuck are you?

335
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:27,867
Dad, Dad,
this is my friend Tommy.

336
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:30,366
Hey, easy, easy.

337
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:31,399
No, Dad, just don't. Don't.

338
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:35,567
In my house?

339
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,233
In my house?

340
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:40,666
Fuck!

341
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:50,200
What the hell?

342
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:00,234
Calm down.
It's cool.

343
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,266
It's cool.

344
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:53,501
It's okay.

345
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,166
You have a family?

346
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,533
I have a daughter,
yeah.

347
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:05,834
She's eight.

348
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:07,667
She's coming at 2:3O tomorrow.

349
00:30:07,732 --> 00:30:10,234
I don't think I've ever
seen her around here.

350
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:13,101
We have a house
outside the city.

351
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,400
I bought this apartment

352
00:30:14,465 --> 00:30:17,434
for nights I work late
at the hospital.

353
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:20,099
You have a wife?

354
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,401
She's, um...

355
00:30:22,465 --> 00:30:23,566
she passed away,

356
00:30:23,632 --> 00:30:25,800
unfortunately.

357
00:30:27,532 --> 00:30:32,303
Yeah, she passed away,
unfortunately.

358
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:35,968
Oh, I'm so sorry.

359
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,801
Yeah, well, it was hard.

360
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:41,703
It was hard
for a long time.

361
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:45,603
But, you know, when I look
at my daughter now,

362
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:50,303
I can still
I can still see my wife in her.

363
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:52,500
You know,
she's never really gone.

364
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:05,466
I think I can handle one more.

365
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:22,035
It's really so nice
to finally hang out with a guy

366
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:25,469
and not have to worry about...

367
00:31:25,532 --> 00:31:28,134
not have to worry about,
you know?

368
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,335
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

369
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:06,934
Go on.

370
00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:35,033
Okay, one, two, three.

371
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,801
What do you see
up there?

372
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:41,800
Is there a door?

373
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,567
The one back here is wall

374
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,467
but there's another
about 15 feet up there.

375
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:50,600
Maybe I can try
to open it.

376
00:32:50,665 --> 00:32:52,433
Do you think
you can climb up there?

377
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:53,700
You need help up there?

378
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:55,834
No, no. It's all right. I can reach it.

379
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:57,734
Oh, thank God.

380
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,500
We're gonna be okay.

381
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:05,933
Shit.

382
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:06,966
Oh, God.

383
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:24,634
I'm sorry
about before,

384
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:26,067
when I hit him.

385
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:28,068
Oh, it's all right.

386
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,869
You had to do something.

387
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:33,301
I was afraid
it might upset you.

388
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:35,834
I'm fine.

389
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:38,001
Besides, he seems
to be over it.

390
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:25,600
I feel like I'm never going to graduate.

391
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:27,700
I wish your grandfather
could've seen you...

392
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,400
Worked in response...

393
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:30,532
Life is for living?

394
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:31,933
What does that
even mean?

395
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,567
I am living my life right now.

396
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:37,233
You were just wonderful.

397
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:38,266
Life is work.

398
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:39,934
That's what I have to do.

399
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:40,966
I want better things for you.

400
00:34:41,032 --> 00:34:42,299
Maybe it'll change at some point.

401
00:34:42,366 --> 00:34:43,900
Better and better.

402
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:00,402
As soon as we get out of here,
there's something I have to do

403
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,167
Something about...that?

404
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:04,601
I mean the blood.

405
00:35:04,665 --> 00:35:09,036
Some kind of accident?

406
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:10,066
It's okay.

407
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:11,400
You don't have to.

408
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:34,902
I have something
I need to do too.

409
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,668
Does it have to do
with your daughter?

410
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:41,001
More like
for my daughter.

411
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:45,203
She's getting dropped off
here tomorrow, 2:30.

412
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:46,800
And I really need
to clean up.

413
00:35:46,866 --> 00:35:48,334
She might not like
what she'd find.

414
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,567
Come here.

415
00:35:56,632 --> 00:36:00,902
Sit down.

416
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:03,268
Would you like
some wine?

417
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,534
Yeah, I'd love some.

418
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:07,902
Red?
White?

419
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:11,536
Pink?

420
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,234
White sounds good.

421
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:15,700
Okay.

422
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:32,866
Thanks.

423
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,001
Come on.
Get loose.

424
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,467
Feel like you're at home.

425
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:45,334
Put your head back.

426
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,736
This place, it's kind of like
my bachelor pad, you know?

427
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:50,433
I usually use it for alone time.

428
00:36:54,665 --> 00:36:55,799
What is it, porn?

429
00:36:55,866 --> 00:36:59,402
Do I look
like that kind of guy?

430
00:36:59,465 --> 00:37:02,167
Yes, porn.

431
00:37:04,899 --> 00:37:08,902
Let yourself go.

432
00:37:08,966 --> 00:37:11,802
Let go.

433
00:37:11,866 --> 00:37:12,833
Lose it with me.

434
00:37:41,532 --> 00:37:42,799
Uh!

435
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:05,767
Oh, my God.

436
00:38:11,432 --> 00:38:12,766
Shit.

437
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:16,834
What the hell was that?

438
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:20,700
What the fuck
did you do up there?

439
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,535
Hey, are you okay up there?

440
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:25,966
Don't touch my leg.

441
00:38:26,032 --> 00:38:27,266
Don't touch it.
Don't touch it.

442
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,835
Ugh.

443
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:34,900
It's that bad, huh?

444
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:36,233
What the fuck
did you do up there?

445
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:37,233
Karl, help me, please.

446
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:39,167
No, no, no!
No, no.

447
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,534
Hey.

448
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,300
Karl, please!

449
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:44,334
Please.

450
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:46,333
Oh, fuck.

451
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,334
Ah!

452
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,034
Grab that knife.

453
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:57,800
Oh, God.

454
00:38:57,866 --> 00:38:59,034
Oh, God.

455
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:01,733
Well, it's definitely broken.

456
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:03,100
Is he going to be okay?

457
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,433
If we get out of here soon, yes.

458
00:39:04,499 --> 00:39:05,566
We don't

459
00:39:05,632 --> 00:39:06,566
Wait. I don't want
to lose my leg.

460
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:07,966
Yeah, well
that's a long ways off.

461
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,233
But we can do something.

462
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:11,067
I have some pills,
some painkillers.

463
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,968
I have water. Here.

464
00:39:17,632 --> 00:39:19,200
You could've
mentioned that sooner.

465
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:20,467
Sorry.

466
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:22,600
For the pain, Tommy.

467
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,333
I just don't drink it all, okay?

468
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,567
That's all we have.

469
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:28,599
That's it.

470
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:47,266
What does it say?

471
00:39:48,732 --> 00:39:50,266
Your emerg…

472
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,467
Help!

473
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:53,367
Help!
We need medical attention in here.

474
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,534
Please help!

475
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,933
I think it only works
one way.

476
00:39:56,999 --> 00:39:58,467
Please help us!

477
00:39:58,532 --> 00:39:59,799
Please.

478
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:02,101
We're aware of your emergency.

479
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,500
Please stay calm.

480
00:40:03,565 --> 00:40:07,168
An elevator mechanic
will be with you shortly.

481
00:40:07,233 --> 00:40:09,168
And make it quick.

482
00:40:09,233 --> 00:40:10,634
Thank God.

483
00:40:12,732 --> 00:40:14,366
Any second now.

484
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:17,934
How do you think they're
going to pull us out of here?

485
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,500
Let them worry
about the logistics.

486
00:40:19,565 --> 00:40:21,099
Right now, I just want
to get out of here.

487
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:25,336
We're aware of your emergency.

488
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,435
Please stay calm.

489
00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:30,768
An elevator mechanic
will be with you shortly.

490
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:40,437
We're aware
of your emergency.

491
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:42,634
Please stay calm.

492
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:45,802
An elevator mechanic
will be with you shortly.

493
00:41:03,766 --> 00:41:09,004
We're aware
of your emergency.

494
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:13,970
Please stay calm.

495
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:39,899
Almost 4:OO in the morning.

496
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,901
Been in here
nine hours.

497
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,300
Severe internal bleeding.

498
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:53,635
Her organs
are beyond repair.

499
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:57,702
If she wasn't such a fighter,
she'd be gone already.

500
00:42:00,899 --> 00:42:03,268
Is she in pain?

501
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,900
She's sedated,
but she's conscious.

502
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:07,367
Does she know?

503
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:13,036
I was under explicit orders
not to feed her any bullshit.

504
00:42:19,866 --> 00:42:25,004
Do you want me to call anyone,
parents, an aunt or uncle?

505
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,101
No, there's, um...

506
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,968
There's nobody.

507
00:42:35,032 --> 00:42:38,969
It's always just been me
and my grandma, pretty much, so..

508
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:46,201
I'd like to see her now.

509
00:42:52,465 --> 00:42:53,465
Help me!

510
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:22,000
Maybe we should sleep in shifts.

511
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,133
What's that going to do, kid?

512
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,700
If this elevator collapses,

513
00:43:24,766 --> 00:43:27,034
it's going to do it whether
or not we're keeping guard.

514
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:29,067
Remember, it's going to be
daylight soon.

515
00:43:30,932 --> 00:43:34,935
And if one of us hears something,
like people outside,

516
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:39,670
we should be able to yell.

517
00:43:39,732 --> 00:43:40,699
Tommy's right.

518
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:43,068
Of course he's right.

519
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:45,635
He disagreed with me.

520
00:43:45,699 --> 00:43:47,434
So you want to go first?

521
00:44:11,665 --> 00:44:13,767
I can't take this anymore.

522
00:44:18,932 --> 00:44:22,969
What are we going to do?

523
00:44:23,032 --> 00:44:26,068
What can I do?

524
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:32,134
Let's run away.

525
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:33,533
After last night,
he'll come back.

526
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,334
And things are only
gonna get worse.

527
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,567
You know it.

528
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,799
That's crazy.

529
00:44:37,866 --> 00:44:39,033
What's crazy
is staying here with him.

530
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:41,568
We don't have
the money for that.

531
00:44:41,632 --> 00:44:43,200
No, but my father does.

532
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:46,402
And I know
where he keeps it.

533
00:44:46,465 --> 00:44:47,432
My father...

534
00:44:51,299 --> 00:44:54,368
He always keeps some cash
around the house for betting.

535
00:44:54,432 --> 00:44:56,967
I found a wad yesterday.

536
00:44:57,032 --> 00:44:57,966
Take it.

537
00:44:58,032 --> 00:44:59,133
He owes you.

538
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:00,133
If he finds out it's missing

539
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:02,267
No, we'll be
at the airport.

540
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,334
Tonight?

541
00:45:08,133 --> 00:45:10,935
Tonight.

542
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:18,871
We need to think about
rationing that water.

543
00:45:18,932 --> 00:45:20,233
He needs it.

544
00:45:20,299 --> 00:45:22,901
Yeah, well, he's going
to need it in six hours too.

545
00:45:22,966 --> 00:45:24,667
And we'll need it
in six hours.

546
00:45:26,233 --> 00:45:29,369
We weren't the ones
who tried to play superhero.

547
00:45:29,432 --> 00:45:31,000
We're gonna be
out of here by then.

548
00:45:31,066 --> 00:45:33,201
Yeah?

549
00:45:33,266 --> 00:45:34,233
I hope so.

550
00:46:13,832 --> 00:46:15,333
Hey.

551
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,334
No way.

552
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,834
Excuse me?

553
00:46:17,899 --> 00:46:19,900
Please don't.
I have asthma.

554
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,967
I'll blow my smoke
out the opening.

555
00:46:33,032 --> 00:46:34,633
Sorry. No.

556
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:35,966
Look, it's been a long time, lady.

557
00:46:36,032 --> 00:46:38,067
I don't know if you've
ever had an addiction

558
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:39,100
Oh, I don't know
if you've ever had

559
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:40,500
your throat close up
on you before.

560
00:46:40,565 --> 00:46:41,933
Well, you have
your inhaler, right?

561
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,333
Yeah, but that's
not he point

562
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,235
Well, you know,
you'll be fine.

563
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:47,601
I'm a doctor,
remember?

564
00:46:52,432 --> 00:46:53,800
Tommy?

565
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,701
Tommy!

566
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:03,667
Tommy, I know you're in there.

567
00:47:03,732 --> 00:47:06,668
I saw your motorcycle outside.

568
00:47:09,932 --> 00:47:12,134
Thanks a lot,
asshole.

569
00:47:16,465 --> 00:47:17,432
Put it out.

570
00:47:17,499 --> 00:47:20,802
I have asthma.

571
00:47:20,866 --> 00:47:23,134
I said, ''Cut it out.''

572
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:25,234
I asked you
to put it out, now.

573
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:27,167
I'm telling you
to put that thing out.

574
00:47:27,233 --> 00:47:28,434
I'm almost done.

575
00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:29,833
It's blowing back
in the room.

576
00:47:29,899 --> 00:47:31,133
No, it isn't.

577
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:32,166
Stop fighting.

578
00:47:35,233 --> 00:47:36,634
This isn't good
for any of us.

579
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:38,367
Jesus Christ,
calm down, Claudia.

580
00:47:38,432 --> 00:47:39,599
Maybe you should have one.

581
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:41,400
Oh, okay, you want
to fucking pollute the air?

582
00:47:41,465 --> 00:47:43,433
Go ahead. We'll just
close the fucking door.

583
00:47:43,499 --> 00:47:44,433
Ow!

584
00:47:44,499 --> 00:47:45,433
Sorry.

585
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:46,933
Fucking bitch!

586
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:48,934
And everything
for a fucking cigarette!

587
00:47:52,066 --> 00:47:53,767
Great. Now we got
a regular gimp collection.

588
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:55,333
I said I'm sorry.

589
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,702
It's been five hours, and we're already
like lord of the flies.

590
00:47:57,766 --> 00:47:58,700
I said I'm sorry, okay?

591
00:47:58,766 --> 00:47:59,833
Just like a woman!

592
00:47:59,899 --> 00:48:01,000
Look, this isn't helping.

593
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:05,834
And, you know,
it's true, kid.

594
00:48:05,899 --> 00:48:08,067
You used to be able to smoke
anywhere, fucking anywhere:

595
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:11,769
movie theaters, airplanes,
hospitals, supermarkets.

596
00:48:11,832 --> 00:48:14,067
Fucking moral majority's
taken over!

597
00:48:14,133 --> 00:48:15,300
Calm down.

598
00:48:15,366 --> 00:48:18,001
Oh, God,
I need to get out of here.

599
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:19,467
Let us out of here!

600
00:48:19,532 --> 00:48:20,933
I hate this God damn

601
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,467
Let us the fuck out!

602
00:48:24,532 --> 00:48:25,633
Oh, my God,
you have a temper.

603
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:26,666
God!

604
00:48:26,732 --> 00:48:27,899
What, just like a woman?

605
00:48:27,966 --> 00:48:29,767
Exactly, just like a woman
to set a guy off...

606
00:48:31,832 --> 00:48:35,035
And then calmly criticize him
for blowing up!

607
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:36,633
What the fuck
is your problem?

608
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,367
This is it.

609
00:48:47,565 --> 00:48:49,967
Nobody move.

610
00:48:50,032 --> 00:48:50,999
Shit.

611
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:03,333
Don't fucking move.

612
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,434
Shh.

613
00:49:06,732 --> 00:49:07,966
Tommy?

614
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:17,667
Tommy?

615
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,968
We were born in these lives,
Francesca.

616
00:49:57,032 --> 00:49:58,800
We didn't have a choice.

617
00:49:58,866 --> 00:50:02,169
But it's time that we take over
and do it for ourselves.

618
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:28,334
Help me!

619
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,234
Don't cry.

620
00:50:47,299 --> 00:50:50,001
Abuela, I'm sorry.

621
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,702
When it's your turn,
it's your turn.

622
00:51:00,899 --> 00:51:02,867
Shh, don't talk.

623
00:51:02,932 --> 00:51:04,533
It's okay.

624
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:06,634
I have to.

625
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:10,502
Last chance
to piss you off.

626
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:13,067
Abuela,
it's not funny.

627
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:16,936
Remember.

628
00:51:16,999 --> 00:51:20,302
you'll have to bend

629
00:51:20,366 --> 00:51:21,900
Isn't it ''break''?

630
00:51:21,966 --> 00:51:23,934
Whatever.

631
00:51:25,899 --> 00:51:28,268
I just need you
to get me something.

632
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:33,004
The photograph
on my table.

633
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:36,836
I need him with me
when my time comes.

634
00:51:36,899 --> 00:51:38,800
I'll get you
the photograph.

635
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:40,534
At this point, it's a matter of time.

636
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:43,133
How long?

637
00:51:44,532 --> 00:51:46,367
Uh, maybe tomorrow,

638
00:51:46,432 --> 00:51:48,167
maybe...

639
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:50,101
in a few hours.

640
00:51:51,766 --> 00:51:52,766
Claudia.

641
00:51:52,832 --> 00:51:55,267
Hurry.

642
00:51:57,766 --> 00:51:59,868
I love you.

643
00:52:00,766 --> 00:52:02,601
Hurry.

644
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,934
You've been holding out on us.

645
00:52:37,465 --> 00:52:38,399
What?

646
00:52:38,465 --> 00:52:39,599
first water.

647
00:52:39,665 --> 00:52:41,566
Now candy?

648
00:52:41,632 --> 00:52:43,500
Fucking convenience store
you got there.

649
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:49,334
Asshole.
What the

650
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,268
what are you doing?

651
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:52,701
What the

652
00:52:55,465 --> 00:52:56,432
Give it to me.

653
00:52:56,499 --> 00:52:58,367
Give me
the candy bar.

654
00:53:06,366 --> 00:53:08,000
No.

655
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:10,001
Don't.
Jesus, don't.

656
00:53:10,066 --> 00:53:11,634
Here.

657
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:12,766
Give it back, please.

658
00:53:12,832 --> 00:53:14,567
What the fuck?

659
00:53:14,632 --> 00:53:16,400
That isn't cool, man.

660
00:53:17,465 --> 00:53:19,200
Give it back to me, please.

661
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:20,634
I'd rather not.

662
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:27,269
Chill out, man.

663
00:53:30,299 --> 00:53:31,299
Now, look...

664
00:53:34,133 --> 00:53:35,534
We're not going
to get out of here

665
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,767
until we stop
yelling at each other

666
00:53:37,832 --> 00:53:38,899
and start working together.

667
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:42,669
And we need one person, one,

668
00:53:42,732 --> 00:53:43,699
to make all the decisions.

669
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:47,436
We need a strong leader.

670
00:53:47,499 --> 00:53:49,934
Now, I'm just
strengthening my hand.

671
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:51,400
And don't worry.

672
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:53,300
I'll give you a hit
when you need one,

673
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:56,001
if you behave.

674
00:54:01,766 --> 00:54:03,734
What kind of a monster are you?

675
00:54:05,766 --> 00:54:07,434
Monster?

676
00:54:10,032 --> 00:54:12,501
Don't you think you're being
a bit dramatic?

677
00:54:24,732 --> 00:54:27,401
Maybe I'm just destined
for something else.

678
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,068
I don't know.

679
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:33,002
I'd like to think I'm meant
for higher things, though, you know?

680
00:54:33,066 --> 00:54:35,435
Higher things.

681
00:54:37,999 --> 00:54:39,934
My father always told me,

682
00:54:39,999 --> 00:54:42,735
''To endure
is to conquer our fate.''

683
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:43,766
Fate?

684
00:54:43,832 --> 00:54:44,866
Yeah.

685
00:54:44,932 --> 00:54:45,999
Do you really believe
that shit?

686
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:49,367
I like your eyes.

687
00:54:49,432 --> 00:54:51,066
Destiny sucks.

688
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:19,767
You'll be fine.

689
00:55:19,832 --> 00:55:21,433
Yeah, you'll be fine.

690
00:55:39,366 --> 00:55:40,667
There's no chance.

691
00:55:47,565 --> 00:55:48,565
No destiny.

692
00:55:51,465 --> 00:55:53,433
No fate.

693
00:55:58,532 --> 00:56:00,800
There's only
what you take from the world

694
00:56:00,866 --> 00:56:02,634
and what the world
takes from you.

695
00:56:05,366 --> 00:56:06,433
You know that now,

696
00:56:06,499 --> 00:56:10,269
don't you...

697
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,401
my darling?

698
00:56:43,966 --> 00:56:46,968
What the hell are you doing, man?

699
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:50,101
Just making sure everything still works.

700
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:04,535
She's pretty good-looking, isn't she?

701
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:06,968
I got a girlfriend, man.

702
00:57:07,032 --> 00:57:09,000
At least I did.

703
00:57:09,066 --> 00:57:10,801
God, I hope
she's okay.

704
00:57:10,866 --> 00:57:12,234
He's going to know by now.

705
00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:14,934
Oh, boo-hoo.

706
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:16,834
My little girl sees
the mess I made upstairs,

707
00:57:16,899 --> 00:57:17,899
let me just say,

708
00:57:17,966 --> 00:57:19,400
her idea of me
as the perfect father

709
00:57:19,465 --> 00:57:21,366
is going to be
severely tested.

710
00:57:21,432 --> 00:57:22,666
2:3O.

711
00:57:22,732 --> 00:57:26,035
She's going
to be up there at 2:3O.

712
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:28,100
And her lips
were trembling,

713
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:30,935
and I take this blade,
and I cut her up.

714
00:57:30,999 --> 00:57:33,634
And it's beautiful.
It's fucking beautiful.

715
00:57:33,699 --> 00:57:35,734
We were supposed
to run away to Paris.

716
00:57:38,999 --> 00:57:40,266
Do people still run away?

717
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:42,301
I thought
we placated all you kids

718
00:57:42,366 --> 00:57:45,469
with cell phones
and video games.

719
00:57:45,532 --> 00:57:46,599
Shut up, man.

720
00:57:46,665 --> 00:57:47,766
No, I'm just
kidding around.

721
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:50,301
Paris, it's a great city.

722
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,034
The food.

723
00:57:52,099 --> 00:57:53,300
Some of the women there

724
00:57:53,366 --> 00:57:56,802
are even more sexually
adventurous than I am,

725
00:57:56,866 --> 00:57:58,867
and that's
saying something.

726
00:58:02,032 --> 00:58:04,701
We're going to have
to get something on these cuts.

727
00:58:04,766 --> 00:58:06,801
What do you think
she's like?

728
00:58:09,066 --> 00:58:10,000
What do you mean?

729
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:12,401
Usually the hot ones,

730
00:58:12,465 --> 00:58:13,465
they just lay there.

731
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,667
You're out of line, man.

732
00:58:15,732 --> 00:58:17,300
It's true.

733
00:58:17,366 --> 00:58:18,800
Bitches are so used
to getting there way.

734
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:21,034
And why?

735
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:22,633
Just 'cause
they look pretty.

736
00:58:25,465 --> 00:58:26,999
Salt.

737
00:58:33,499 --> 00:58:35,234
Up and down.

738
00:58:35,299 --> 00:58:38,635
Last breaths.

739
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:39,933
She seems
like she likes this.

740
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,133
Salt.

741
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:49,168
They get all the jobs.

742
00:58:49,233 --> 00:58:53,236
They get
all the attention.

743
00:58:53,299 --> 00:58:55,434
But what about
the rest of us, Tommy?

744
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:57,133
What about us?

745
00:58:57,199 --> 00:58:58,967
Sometimes I wonder

746
00:58:59,032 --> 00:59:03,870
why was I born
in such a fucked-up era?

747
00:59:03,932 --> 00:59:05,633
Yeah, man.

748
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:06,666
Fucked up.

749
00:59:06,732 --> 00:59:07,866
Yeah.

750
00:59:07,932 --> 00:59:13,637
Well, you'll see what I mean
someday, buddy.

751
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:19,933
Pills, man.

752
00:59:19,999 --> 00:59:21,734
Please.
Please.

753
00:59:33,532 --> 00:59:36,268
7:3O.

754
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:39,069
Hope.

755
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:41,468
Let's have
some fucking hope.

756
00:59:48,832 --> 00:59:50,700
They're gonna find her.

757
00:59:50,766 --> 00:59:52,400
They're gonna find her.

758
01:00:22,699 --> 01:00:25,134
Can you feel me now?

759
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:37,136
Can you feel me now?

760
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:06,233
The building, man.

761
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:09,869
Do you think...

762
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:11,867
Do you think
it was terrorists?

763
01:01:11,932 --> 01:01:14,034
Terrorists?

764
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:17,001
In the Bifrost Bridge Building?

765
01:01:17,066 --> 01:01:18,000
Yeah.

766
01:01:18,066 --> 01:01:20,501
You know what?

767
01:01:20,565 --> 01:01:23,868
I'd say it was
definitely terrorists.

768
01:01:23,932 --> 01:01:25,300
But how do you think
they made it past

769
01:01:25,366 --> 01:01:27,034
all the security downstairs?

770
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,036
Maybe it was aliens, man.

771
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:38,401
Like in
The TwilightZone,

772
01:01:38,465 --> 01:01:40,834
when the electricity goes out,

773
01:01:40,899 --> 01:01:44,769
and everybody thinks
it was everyone else.

774
01:01:44,832 --> 01:01:47,601
But really,

775
01:01:47,665 --> 01:01:50,034
it was aliens.

776
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:52,668
Well.

777
01:01:52,732 --> 01:01:54,967
I don't know
about that.

778
01:01:55,032 --> 01:01:57,701
But there's one thing
I do know,

779
01:01:57,766 --> 01:02:03,004
and that is that if I don't
get out of here soon,

780
01:02:03,066 --> 01:02:06,569
I'm going to cut
your fucking throat...

781
01:02:06,632 --> 01:02:09,001
and I'm going to rape
the shit out of that cunt.

782
01:02:12,632 --> 01:02:13,599
What?

783
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:42,602
Oh, God, how many cigarettes
have you smoked?

784
01:03:42,665 --> 01:03:44,666
Please give me my inhaler.

785
01:03:49,932 --> 01:03:50,899
Give it to me.

786
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:53,867
Please give me
my inhaler.

787
01:04:00,066 --> 01:04:01,033
Please.

788
01:04:07,699 --> 01:04:09,300
God damn it.

789
01:04:09,366 --> 01:04:12,936
You'll get over it.

790
01:04:12,999 --> 01:04:15,968
I want to show you
something.

791
01:04:16,032 --> 01:04:17,299
Look.

792
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:20,400
Come here.

793
01:04:23,166 --> 01:04:24,300
Look.

794
01:04:25,299 --> 01:04:26,633
Fire alarm.

795
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:30,167
You hold this

796
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:33,569
underneath the sensor

797
01:04:33,632 --> 01:04:35,967
and we'll be hearing sirens
before you've even climbed down.

798
01:04:36,032 --> 01:04:37,333
I'm having
a hard time breathing.

799
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,334
You want a hit?
- Please.

800
01:04:38,432 --> 01:04:40,967
Okay.
- No.

801
01:04:43,866 --> 01:04:45,200
And since you're going up there anyway...

802
01:04:52,266 --> 01:04:58,071
Now, look, I really,
really need to excuse myself

803
01:04:58,133 --> 01:05:03,004
from this elevator.

804
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:08,271
So don't you dream
of coming back here

805
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,935
without setting
that alarm off.

806
01:06:31,032 --> 01:06:33,367
Come on.
You can do this.

807
01:06:33,432 --> 01:06:34,933
You can do this.

808
01:06:34,999 --> 01:06:36,667
Come on.

809
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:09,134
Come on.

810
01:07:41,899 --> 01:07:43,233
What the.

811
01:07:45,032 --> 01:07:48,402
Fuck.

812
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:50,165
Claudia?

813
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,900
My daughter
should be here by now.

814
01:07:51,966 --> 01:07:55,936
Oh, you are dead,
you fucking cunt.

815
01:08:03,732 --> 01:08:04,666
Claudia.

816
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:07,701
Claudia?

817
01:08:18,532 --> 01:08:19,666
Hey.

818
01:08:19,732 --> 01:08:20,666
I'm right here.

819
01:08:20,732 --> 01:08:21,999
Are you okay?

820
01:08:22,066 --> 01:08:24,101
Yeah, listen, I was on the top
of the elevator right now.

821
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,133
Jesus.

822
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:30,100
What's going on?

823
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:31,500
Karl.

824
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:33,433
Can you imagine how
she's going to react?

825
01:08:33,499 --> 01:08:34,433
What?

826
01:08:34,499 --> 01:08:36,567
My little girl,

827
01:08:36,632 --> 01:08:37,966
Nikky.

828
01:08:38,032 --> 01:08:39,800
Nobody should need
to see that kind of thing.

829
01:08:43,499 --> 01:08:44,933
I protected her
the first time.

830
01:08:44,999 --> 01:08:46,033
What are you talking about, Karl?

831
01:08:46,099 --> 01:08:47,066
I did.

832
01:08:47,133 --> 01:08:48,167
Why are you

833
01:08:48,233 --> 01:08:51,135
You can plan
your whole life out.

834
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,402
You can plot
the most complex course.

835
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:01,200
But sooner or later

836
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:03,968
you're going to walk
into some piece-of-shit elevator.

837
01:09:04,032 --> 01:09:05,333
Karl?

838
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,467
Listen to me.
Listen.

839
01:09:06,532 --> 01:09:08,000
I was on top
of the elevator right now.

840
01:09:08,066 --> 01:09:09,700
I looked over the side,

841
01:09:09,766 --> 01:09:11,601
and I could see that
we're almost at floor level.

842
01:09:11,665 --> 01:09:14,701
The optimism of youth.

843
01:09:14,766 --> 01:09:19,237
It's remarkably enduring.

844
01:09:19,299 --> 01:09:22,068
In fact.

845
01:09:22,133 --> 01:09:24,768
it's usually
the last thing to go

846
01:09:24,832 --> 01:09:27,167
when I cut some bitch up.

847
01:09:27,233 --> 01:09:28,701
Fuck.

848
01:09:28,766 --> 01:09:31,606
Their eyes pleading
and hoping to the end.

849
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:40,900
You can almost
hear them thinking,

850
01:09:40,966 --> 01:09:42,000
''This isn't me.''

851
01:09:42,066 --> 01:09:44,001
No, this isn't me.

852
01:09:44,066 --> 01:09:45,033
Get the fuck
away from me.

853
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:46,467
''This isn't my life.

854
01:09:46,532 --> 01:09:47,633
''I got class tonight.

855
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:49,000
I can't be late for class.''

856
01:09:49,066 --> 01:09:50,333
Get the fuck
away from me.

857
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,768
Why do they always say that?

858
01:09:51,832 --> 01:09:53,767
Stop it.

859
01:09:53,832 --> 01:09:56,501
Hey, you want
to play something?

860
01:09:56,565 --> 01:09:57,732
Marco.

861
01:09:58,832 --> 01:10:01,568
Come on, guys.

862
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:03,300
Marco.

863
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:04,767
Please stop.

864
01:10:06,099 --> 01:10:07,733
The way it goes:

865
01:10:07,799 --> 01:10:10,368
Marco.

866
01:10:55,932 --> 01:10:59,201
You killed him.

867
01:10:59,266 --> 01:11:01,601
Finally,

868
01:11:01,665 --> 01:11:04,501
some privacy.

869
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:06,333
You killed him.

870
01:11:14,565 --> 01:11:15,899
What's the point, Claudia?

871
01:11:15,966 --> 01:11:17,033
We all know
how this ends.

872
01:11:17,099 --> 01:11:18,500
Please.

873
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:20,934
You think the others
didn't say please?

874
01:11:20,999 --> 01:11:22,333
I can get us out of here.

875
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,567
Give me the knife.

876
01:11:23,632 --> 01:11:25,467
You have got
to be kidding me.

877
01:11:25,532 --> 01:11:28,201
Okay, I won't tell anyone.

878
01:11:28,266 --> 01:11:31,902
Please have a conscience.

879
01:11:31,966 --> 01:11:33,267
Think about
your daughter.

880
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:34,701
Daddy.

881
01:11:34,766 --> 01:11:35,733
What are you doing?

882
01:11:38,665 --> 01:11:39,966
Please.

883
01:11:40,032 --> 01:11:42,934
Daddy, you're not playing well.

884
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,333
What conscience?

885
01:11:49,066 --> 01:11:51,301
She'll never learn!

886
01:11:51,366 --> 01:11:53,668
So now learn!

887
01:12:08,066 --> 01:12:09,400
Oh!

888
01:12:18,532 --> 01:12:19,633
Get off!

889
01:12:23,565 --> 01:12:26,301
Ah!

890
01:12:39,832 --> 01:12:42,000
Uh!

891
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,400
Get fucking back here!

892
01:15:33,932 --> 01:15:35,266
Hey, Claudia.

893
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:38,867
Claudia?

894
01:15:43,832 --> 01:15:48,469
How is she?

895
01:15:48,532 --> 01:15:51,034
My grandmother;
how is she?

896
01:15:51,099 --> 01:15:52,767
We'll talk about it later.

897
01:15:56,465 --> 01:15:57,766
Tell me now.

898
01:16:01,565 --> 01:16:04,267
I'm sorry.

899
01:16:11,032 --> 01:16:13,271
I didn't get her the photograph.

900
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:19,535
I tried.

901
01:16:22,966 --> 01:16:25,968
Why do things
like this happen?

902
01:16:29,133 --> 01:16:32,302
I used to think
about that too.

903
01:16:32,366 --> 01:16:34,301
After working here
for a while.

904
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:39,435
I don't think
there is any reason,

905
01:16:39,499 --> 01:16:42,802
no pattern.

906
01:16:42,866 --> 01:16:45,501
Yeah.

907
01:16:45,565 --> 01:16:47,066
You get some rest, okay?
