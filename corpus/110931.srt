1
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,320
People once believed
that when someone dies...

2
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,700
a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.

3
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,120
But sometimes,
something so bad happens...

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,450
that a terrible sadness is carried
with it and the soul can't rest.

5
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,580
Then sometimes,
just sometimes...

6
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,670
the crow can bring that soul back
to put the wrong things right.

7
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,260
Over here.

8
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,350
There's a piece of glass.

9
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,560
Hey, Sarge!

10
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,850
Yeah?

11
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,440
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.
Wedding was tomorrow night.

12
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,770
Who the fuck gets married
on Halloween anyhow?

13
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,780
Nobody.

14
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,320
- Sir, we gotta move her.
- Do it.

15
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,660
All right, guys,
let's do it.

16
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,950
Devil's fucking Night.
What's the count so far?

17
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,410
143 fires.

18
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,290
- They're slacking off from last year.
- Three hours to go.

19
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,260
- Maybe they're just slow starters.
- Coming through!

20
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,550
You guys can't come in here
and take her away like this.

21
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,430
There are procedures. You should have
cleared this with me first.

22
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,810
- Is this the victim?
- No, it's Amelia Earhart.

23
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,730
- We found her, and you missed it.
- I don't care what her name is.

24
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,400
I didn't give the order to move her.
Jesus, Albrecht.

25
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,940
I can see why they took away
your gold shield.

26
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,030
Yeah, I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on. Let's go.

27
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,030
All right, clear out.

28
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,000
- Shelly?
- Stand back, kid.

29
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,460
- Where's Eric?
- Just don't worry about him.

30
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,750
Tell him to take care
of Sarah.

31
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,760
Look, I will.
You just, uh, lie back. Come on.

32
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,600
- You Sarah?
- Yeah.

33
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,730
Yeah, look. Your sister,
she's gonna be okay.

34
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,070
She's not my sister.
Shelly just takes care of me.

35
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,450
She's my friend.

36
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,450
Her and Eric.

37
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,750
You lied to her about Eric.

38
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,410
I had to.

39
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,210
And you're lying
to me about Shelly.

40
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,630
She's gonna die,
isn't she?

41
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,300
Hey, uh...

42
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,390
Now, come on.
Come on. It's okay.

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,940
She's gonna be fine.

44
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,880
A building gets torch ed.
All that is left is ashes.

45
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,840
I used to think that was true
about everything...

46
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,340
families, friends, feelings.

47
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,350
But now I know that sometimes,
if love proves real...

48
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,770
two people who are meant to be together,
nothing can keep them apart.

49
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,590
Later.

50
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,230
What are you,
like the night watchman?

51
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,920
You know, what this place
needs is a...

52
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,340
good natural catastrophe.

53
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,840
- Earthquake, tornado, you know.
- No, no, no, no.

54
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,890
Mickey, come on, man. You got to put
the mustard underneath first.

55
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,260
Maybe a flood like in the Bible.

56
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,390
Hey, hey, let me do it.

57
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,520
There we go. All right.
How about some onions?

58
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,020
Come on, man.
Don't cheap out on me.

59
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,030
- Lots of onions.
- All right, here you go.

60
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,490
Hey, all right.

61
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,950
Now we're talking.

62
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,740
Hey, it's the Sarah monster.

63
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,660
- How do you steer that on a wet street?
- Pure talent. Hi.

64
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,670
Now, Sarah, she's a genuine hot dogger.
You hungry?

65
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,550
- You buying?
- I'm buying.

66
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,300
- No onions though, okay?
- No onions?

67
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,590
They make you fart big time.

68
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,640
You know, Lake Erie
actually caught on fire once...

69
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,360
from all the crap
floating around in it.

70
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,280
I wish I could have seen that.

71
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,090
Fire it up! Yeah!

72
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,140
- All right, we busted their machines!
- Shit!

73
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,490
Oh, oh, shit, guys.
T- bird, cop car, cop car.

74
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,340
Bad people out
on the street tonight.

75
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,300
- Damn it!
- What was that?

76
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,060
- You wait right here.
- Be careful.

77
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,440
Mickey, call it in for me!

78
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,140
Gabriel!

79
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,450
- Eric?
- Department of Housing!

80
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,040
Code violations?
Safety hazards?

81
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,330
Place looks fine to me.

82
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,210
Let's redecorate.

83
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,880
"Abash, the devil stood...

84
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,630
and felt how awful
goodness is.

85
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,310
Saw virtue in her shape, how lovely."
It's pornography.

86
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,310
Virtue?

87
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,360
Shelly?

88
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,400
- No! Eric!
- See ya!

89
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,200
No, no, no, me first.

90
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,490
Please.

91
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,660
- Shelly.
- Eric!

92
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,910
- Hey, that's good.
- That's good.

93
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,380
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?

94
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,380
Look at that.
Look at that.

95
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,180
Here's to Devil's Night,
my new favorite holiday.

96
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,850
You go over there
and talk to your pals...

97
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,020
You sick fuck.

98
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,780
Are you out of
your motherfucking mind, man?

99
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,410
Look at that!

100
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,660
Pussies drink last, man.

101
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,330
- Fuck you, Tin Tin.
- Hey.

102
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,250
Shit ain't
even loaded, man.

103
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,510
This one is.

104
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,510
Which of you Motor City
motherfuckers...

105
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,890
wants to bet me
this one isn't?

106
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,850
Hey, fire it up!
Fire it up!

107
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,020
- Fire it up! - Fire
it up! - Fire it up!

108
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,900
Fire it up! Fire it up!

109
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,070
Here's your shooters.

110
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,110
- Put your guns away, huh, guys?
- How ya doing?

111
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,870
Pussycat.

112
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,510
Boo.

113
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,030
- I love you.
- Say that again.

114
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,360
I love you.

115
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,610
Oh, boy.

116
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,120
Restaurant.

117
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,960
- Wow, you look great.
- Ta-da!

118
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,970
Yeah!

119
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,590
- Come here!
- No, no, no!

120
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,280
Couple more rings.
That's 24k.

121
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,370
24k, huh? It's 18k.
It's crap. It's probably fake.

122
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,780
Leather purse. Leather.

123
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,370
Geez. Oh, what is this, Tin Tin?

124
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,000
A blood stain
that's on here?

125
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,710
I'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.

126
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,630
Now, you,
take it or leave it.

127
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,470
Right there for ya.

128
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,930
Decisions, decisions.

129
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,640
You cheap ass, chrome dome...

130
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,730
...child molesting,
saprophyte motherfucker.

131
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,150
Close the gate
when you go out!

132
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,900
Oh, I close this up
for you real good, massa.

133
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,490
Fuck you.

134
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,990
Yeah, sit on it and twirl,
you dirty scum.

135
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,170
Lucky I didn't stab
your fat ass.

136
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,360
What the fuck you all painted
up for, crackhead, huh?

137
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,200
Halloween ain't till manana.

138
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,120
Come on.

139
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,620
Fuck, you murderer!

140
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,330
I ain't murdered nobody, man!
I don't even fucking know you!

141
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,500
- Man, what the fuck you want, man?
- I want you to tell me a story.

142
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,010
A man and a woman
in a loft a year ago.

143
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,630
- You're out of your fucking mind...
- Listen!

144
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,550
I'm sure you'll remember.
You killed them... on Halloween.

145
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,600
Yeah, yeah, Halloween, yeah.
Some dude, some bitch, whatever, man.

146
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,100
Her name was Shelly.

147
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,190
You cut her.
You raped her.

148
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:02,070
Shelly, yeah, yeah. I shanked
her pink ass and she loved it!

149
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:16,210
Murderer? Murderer? Let me tell you
about murder. It's fun!

150
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,920
It's easy.
You gonna learn all about it.

151
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,180
I'd like you to meet
two buddies of mine.

152
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,930
We never miss.

153
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,440
Try harder.

154
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,610
- Try again!
- Aaah!

155
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,540
Victims.
Aren't we all?

156
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,610
- Look at this mess! What's the world coming to?
- It's a mess.

157
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,750
I got to go upstairs.
Report from the front.

158
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,800
Get out of my way,
you worms!

159
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,840
Give me some of that
over there!

160
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,800
Why don't you ladies come by later?
Check me out.

161
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,640
Hey, guess what?
Arcade Games fell down, went boom.

162
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,520
- Boom.
- Can you imagine that? It's tragic.

163
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,820
Gather your soldiers.
You're on for tomorrow night. No sweat.

164
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,950
- Is the man in?
- He's taking a meeting.

165
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,770
You're thinking
about the past.

166
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,570
Dad gave me this.

167
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,820
Fifth birthday.

168
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,580
He said childhood's over
the moment you know you're gonna die.

169
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,930
Is she asleep?

170
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,390
I think we broke her.

171
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,520
I love her eyes.

172
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,530
Pretty.

173
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,300
Hey, kid,
get the hell outta the road!

174
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,450
I told you to stay out of here.

175
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,160
So I guess you're not gonna be home
till a lot later, huh, Darla?

176
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,290
She's busy. Go play with your dolls
or something, okay?

177
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,670
I don't have any dolls.

178
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,130
Get some food, huh?

179
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,170
Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.

180
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:38,560
- "Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police."

181
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,820
Thirty, forty dollars.

182
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,030
Who the fuck is this now?

183
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,240
Hey! Piss off!
We're closed!

184
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,000
Cerrado!

185
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,920
Sleep it off somewhere else, dusthead,
unless you want to get mutilated.

186
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:18,760
Goddamn creatures of the night,
they never learn.

187
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,220
Hey! Hey!

188
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,820
"Suddenly I heard
a tapping, as if someone...

189
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,820
gently rapping,
rapping at my chamber door."

190
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,080
What are you talking about?

191
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,870
You heard me rapping, right?

192
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,080
You're trespassing,
and you owe me a fucking new door!

193
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,460
I'm looking for something
in an engagement ring.

194
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,920
Gold.

195
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,340
You're looking for a coroner,
shit-for-brains.

196
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,730
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit on me!

197
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,350
Shit on me.
Shit on me!

198
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,740
- Aaah!
- Mr. Gideon.

199
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,070
You're not paying attention.

200
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,160
No!

201
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,540
I repeat, a gold
engagement ring, yes?

202
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,630
It was pawned here a year ago
by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.

203
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,010
He confided in me
before he ran out of breath.

204
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,310
Who's this sack of shit?

205
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,350
That's Tin Tin, one of
T- bird's little helpers.

206
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,480
I think you can rule out
accidental death.

207
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,360
Don't any of your street demons
have real grown-up names?

208
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,610
This could be a turf hit, but it doesn't
look like your usual gang crap.

209
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,410
Come on, Albrecht, spare me.
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.

210
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,410
I'm suppose to thank you
for that, right?

211
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,250
Word to the wise:
Watch your fucking mouth.

212
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,880
What the hell
do you call that?

213
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,510
I call it blood, detective.

214
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:22,390
I suppose you'll write it up
as graffiti.

215
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:25,220
You can leave
my crime scene now, okay?

216
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,860
- Warmer?
- What are you doing?

217
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,570
- Don't you know this game?
- What game?

218
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,530
Okay, the rings!
I'll tell you about the rings!

219
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:44,990
They're in that metal box!
It's under the shelf there!

220
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,580
Take the fucking rings!
Choke on them, you son of a bitch!

221
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,750
- Look, it goes to the attic.
- Okay.

222
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,930
No, no.

223
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,140
No, no, no.

224
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,860
Oh, it's beautiful.
I don't believe it.

225
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,160
Shelly.

226
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,710
I love you.

227
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,680
- You have one chance to live.
- Take anything you want.

228
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,850
- Thank you.
- Take anything!

229
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,770
Now you're going to tell me
where to find...

230
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,480
the rest of Tin Tin's
little party pals.

231
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,940
The Pit. They all
hang out at The Pit.

232
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:01,110
T- birds's little potato-heads hang out
there. Funboy lives there upstairs.

233
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,200
- Funboy.
- Oh, baby, oh.

234
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,030
- A whole jolly club...
- Please!

235
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,870
- with jolly pirate nicknames!
- Stop! Please!

236
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,620
- Jesus Christ in a taxicab!
- Hold still!

237
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,670
Each one of these is a life...

238
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,260
a life you helped destroy.

239
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,970
I'm begging you.
Don't kill me.

240
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,720
I'm not gonna kill you.

241
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,970
Your job will be to tell the rest
of them that death is coming for them...

242
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,560
tonight.

243
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,820
Tell them Eric Draven
sends his regards.

244
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,790
You walk outta here,
they're gonna erase your sorry ass.

245
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,500
You're nothing but street grease,
you motherfucker!

246
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,710
Is that gasoline I smell?

247
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,750
No, man, no!
No!

248
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,880
No!

249
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,260
No!

250
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,400
It's on the house, kiddo,
you know that.

251
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,780
One root beer.

252
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,530
I can't do anything.

253
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,080
Your mom... technically,
she's off right now.

254
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,290
Yeah, way off.

255
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,800
Police! Don't move!
I said, "Don't move!"

256
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,880
I thought the police
always said, "Freeze!"

257
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,890
I am the police and I say don't move,
Snow White. You move, you're dead.

258
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:58,140
And I say I'm dead and I move.

259
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,520
Not one more step.
I'm serious.

260
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,940
Then shoot, if you will,
Officer Albrecht.

261
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,160
What are you, nuts?
Walking into a gun?

262
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,950
You high?

263
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,200
- You don't remember me?
- What are you talking about?

264
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:18,290
How about Shelly?
Do you remember Shelly Webster?

265
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,040
Shelly Webster's dead, my friend.

266
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,710
I want you to move over to the curb,
nice and easy. Move it!

267
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,590
Okay, we're gonna
wait here for backup.

268
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,140
- It's getting too weird for me.
- Oh, it gets better.

269
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,640
Do you know someone named T-bird?

270
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:42,310
He had a friend who shouldn't have
played with knives. Like the coat?

271
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,980
You're the guy
that murdered Tin Tin.

272
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,570
- Check it out.
- He was already dead.

273
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,990
- He died a year ago.
The moment he touched her.

274
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,750
They're all dead.
They just don't know it yet.

275
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,250
Get away from there!

276
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,460
Cops!
Get outta here!

277
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,920
Leave it, run!

278
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,640
Oh, great, great.

279
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,310
Guy shows up looking like
a mime from hell...

280
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,690
and you lose him
right out in the open.

281
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:27,610
Well, at least he didn't do that walking
against the wind shit. I hate that.

282
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,610
Little early
for Devil's Night.

283
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,910
You are very restless.

284
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,200
Just wish I was a little
hungry again, that's all.

285
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,540
- Be careful of what you ask for.
- Yeah, I may get it, I know.

286
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,060
There are energies
aligning against you.

287
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,600
Seeing is believing,
isn't it?

288
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,410
Mmm, yummy.

289
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,710
Gideon's pawnshop just burned down
to the foundation.

290
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:27,000
Nobody cleared
this little event with me.

291
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,840
I didn't have nothing
to do with that.

292
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,590
You must be
awfully disappointed.

293
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:35,010
I got trouble.
One of my crew got himself perished.

294
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,350
- Yeah, who might that be?
- Tin Tin.

295
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:42,020
Somebody stuck his blades in all his
major organs in alphabetical order.

296
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,640
Gentlemen, by all means,
I think we ought to have...

297
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,900
an introspective moment of silence
for poor, old Tin Tin.

298
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,150
You're working for me
tomorrow night, right?

299
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,030
- Whatever you say, I can do.
- Good.

300
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,910
That's very reassuring.

301
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,000
I still ain't heard
why Gideon's burned down.

302
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,540
Is that a natural catastrophe
or act of God or something?

303
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,460
Call it my need to know.

304
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,660
Let go, you creep!

305
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,750
Nah.

306
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,130
You didn't even slow down,
you dickhead!

307
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,930
He couldn't have stopped.

308
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,300
He was a buttface.
I could have made it.

309
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,430
What are you supposed to be,
a clown or something?

310
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
Sometimes.

311
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,320
It's more like surfing than skating.
I wish the rain would stop, just once.

312
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,990
- It can't rain all the time.
- Eric?

313
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,510
Don't thank me.
Are we fighting the good fight?

314
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:44,930
Double homicide a year ago.
No convictions.

315
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,430
Annie... look at that.

316
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,730
"We, the undersigned tenants of
1929 Caulderon Court Apartments... "

317
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,860
What is this, a petition?

318
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,820
Big "kick me" sign for a very nice girl
who found herself a cause.

319
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,990
- The cause got her killed.
- She was fighting tenant eviction in that neighborhood?

320
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:07,950
Shelly Webster and her nice
rock-and-roll boyfriend, Eric Draven.

321
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,580
The last time you snooped around a case
is when you got put back on the beat.

322
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,670
- I know. Torres keeps reminding me.
- I bet he does.

323
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,430
You're going to wind up
working a school crosswalk.

324
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,600
I'm cool.

325
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,440
You didn't get that file from me, okay?
And don't tell me you owe me one.

326
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,980
Ah, I owe you one!

327
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,110
Yeah, right.

328
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,320
Damn.

329
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,640
Tomorrow night
we can get high...

330
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,390
and watch this whole fucking city
burn from that window.

331
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,920
- There's a big fucking bird over there.
- * No more **

332
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,970
Huh?

333
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,010
It's a squab.

334
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,720
Come here, bird.

335
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,890
Hey, bird.
Hey, bird.

336
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,310
Bird. B-B-Birdie.

337
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,980
Here, birdie, birdie.

338
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,020
Come here, birdie,
birdie, birdie.

339
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,860
Birdie? Hey, birdie?

340
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,530
Here, Funboy.

341
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,830
What the fuck?

342
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:23,760
No, man! Don't do that! You nearly
gave me a fucking heart attack!

343
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,010
Look at him.

344
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,930
Don't sweat it.

345
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,680
It's time for you to take
your bird and leave, freako.

346
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:46,450
Take your shot, Funboy.
You got me dead bang.

347
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:53,370
You are seriously fucked up.
Did you look in the mirror?

348
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:56,960
You need professional help.

349
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,340
Bingo!

350
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,050
He shoots! He scores!

351
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,890
- Jesus Christ!
- Jesus Christ?

352
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,690
Stop me if you heard this one.

353
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,690
Jesus Christ
walks into a hotel.

354
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,570
Ow.

355
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,870
He hands the innkeeper
three nails and he asks...

356
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,490
Don't you ever fucking die?

357
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,830
"Can you put me up for the night?"

358
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,920
- Does that hurt?
- Fuck. Does it... Fuck, does it hurt?

359
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,050
Oh, God.

360
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,220
Look what you've done
to my sheets.

361
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,460
I've got a gun
in my pocket.

362
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,210
You're happy to see me,
aren't you?

363
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,860
Stay away!
Stay away from me!

364
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,540
Look.

365
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,080
Mother is the name for God
on the lips and hearts of all children.

366
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:08,920
Do you understand?
Morphine is bad for you.

367
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:24,150
Your daughter is out there
on the streets waiting for you.

368
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,600
If I wanted ice,
I would have asked for ice!

369
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,930
Now fill it up!

370
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,390
Fill it up yourself, macho man.

371
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,150
I really need this.

372
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,700
All right.

373
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,700
You burn yourself
playing with matches?

374
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,330
- Fuck off.
- You have an appointment.

375
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,870
- Well, shit on me.
- Drink up.

376
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,880
This is a first.
Do I bow or do I curtsy?

377
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,750
Get my friend here
a glass of blood.

378
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,260
Oh! Hey, hey, hon!

379
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,260
Hey, good night, Darla.

380
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,390
You stay put right there.

381
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,900
Get away, steamhead.

382
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,130
Shh.

383
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:31,810
As you can see, I'm
on the corner of 27th and Washington...

384
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,610
- the site of last year's biggest
Devil's Night conflagration.

385
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:37,650
It was exactly one year ago
that the building you see...

386
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,700
across the street from me
was totally demolished by fire.

387
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,910
The fire that was fought
by seven fire companies...

388
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,120
but lost the lives
of two fire fighters.

389
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,960
In fact, if it weren't for the constant
surveillance by the local police...

390
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,960
Freeze!

391
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,550
Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.

392
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,590
Fuck.

393
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,720
Good likeness.

394
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,520
I saw your body, man.
You died. You got buried.

395
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,850
You still have your hat on.

396
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,860
I gotta sit down.

397
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:17,610
Shi...

398
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,530
Holy Shit.

399
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,620
Say...

400
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,000
are you some kind of... ghost?

401
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,040
Boo!

402
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:43,180
I don't know what I am. I need you
to tell me what happened to us.

403
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:49,270
You took a six-story swan dive
out of a window.

404
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,440
She, ah, was beaten and raped.

405
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:57,110
Died at the hospital.
Hey, you asked, man.

406
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,820
Come on. Read the file.

407
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:04,240
Shelly Webster held on
for 30 hours in intensive care.

408
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,540
Her body finally just gave it up.

409
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:11,460
I saw it.
I couldn't do jack for her.

410
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,260
- Hey.
- Don't touch me!

411
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,350
Hey.

412
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,600
You okay?

413
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,350
I saw her.

414
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,280
I saw her
through your eyes.

415
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,440
You stayed with her
the whole time.

416
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:46,990
Yeah, well, you got to
understand something, all right?

417
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,830
I was hoping
she'd come out of it, you know.

418
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:54,830
Give me something
I could work with.

419
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,130
Yeah.

420
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,630
Look, I...

421
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,170
Why didn't you do
something about it?

422
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:05,590
You think any people in that building,
even the ones who signed the petition...

423
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,140
would talk after
what happened to you?

424
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,430
I kept asking
questions and...

425
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,190
finally got busted for sticking
my nose where it wasn't wanted.

426
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:21,150
This your wife?

427
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:25,700
Yeah, we, uh... Well, not anymore,
we're getting a divorce.

428
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:30,530
It's funny.

429
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:34,580
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.

430
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,170
I used to think
they were kind of trivial.

431
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:41,250
Believe me,
nothing is trivial.

432
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:55,350
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.

433
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:03,230
You going to vanish
into thin air again?

434
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,570
I thought I'd use
your front door.

435
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:18,460
Look, man, I'm sorry as hell for what
happened to you and your girlfriend.

436
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,340
Yeah.

437
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,470
Yeah.

438
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:33,060
I got stabbed!
I shot the son of a bitch!

439
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:36,270
I watched the bullet hole
close by itself.

440
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:39,400
And then my business
gets blown up real good.

441
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,730
- Other than that, my day sucked.
- Yeah.

442
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,320
I saw him too.
He had a guitar.

443
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,820
He winked at me before he jumped out
a fourth-floor window like he had wings.

444
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:54,910
He winked at ya?
Musicians.

445
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:57,460
- What else did you see?
- So far I haven't heard...

446
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,040
shit about what you're going to do
about all this crap!

447
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:05,630
What do I get? My livelihood
got flushed and went swirling.

448
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,470
You ain't lost everything.

449
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:13,640
Yeah, and maybe you're not
such a big shot either! Ow! Jesus!

450
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,310
Fair enough. Catch.

451
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,850
Aah! Jesus.

452
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,360
Say hello to the last fellow
who wouldn't cooperate with me.

453
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,440
What're you telling me,
this thing is real?

454
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,150
All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.

455
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,200
Sometimes they're more useful
than the people who bear them.

456
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,410
You're directly out of
your fucking mind! You know that!

457
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,160
Yeah.

458
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:45,380
Eyes see. It's one of the most important
things I learned from my sister.

459
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,710
Sister? She's supposed to be
your sister?
