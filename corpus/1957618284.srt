1
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:03,006
(bells twinkling)
(swishing)

2
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:06,339
(bold orchestral music)

3
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,270
(swishing)

4
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:45,611
(fire crackling)

5
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,880
- Trick or treat, Sean. (laughing)

6
00:00:58,645 --> 00:01:01,145
(owl hooting)

7
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,330
Mr. Jack will break your
back, cut off your head

8
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,703
with a whack, whack, whack.

9
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,459
(striking)

10
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:17,540
There's a story behind that
old nursery rhyme Sean,

11
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,493
would you like to hear it?

12
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:23,270
(owl hooting)

13
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,770
The Pumpkin Man will steal your soul,

14
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,450
snap it up and swallow it whole.

15
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,110
Then just as quick, before you die,

16
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,793
the Pumpkin Man will steal your eyes.

17
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:43,460
(bird calling)
(tense music)

18
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,533
Many years ago, on a night just like this,

19
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,403
the men of Oakmore
Crossing caught a murderer.

20
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,503
The killer was a wicked old wizard.

21
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,040
And before he was hung, he
put a curse on the town,

22
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,400
and told them a monster
would come for them,

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,933
Jack-O, Mr. Jack, the Pumpkin Man.

24
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,723
That Halloween, Jack-O came back.

25
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,833
A farmer got ready to fight the monster.

26
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,293
It was on this old farm,
right where we're sitting.

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,803
But before he left, he
said goodbye to his son,

28
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,950
a little boy, with the same
last name as yours Sean,

29
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,433
a boy named Kelly.

30
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,494
(tense music)

31
00:02:48,075 --> 00:02:51,158
(metal bell ringing)

32
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,720
(gentle orchestral music)

33
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:33,827
- [Arthur] I told you to keep the boy

34
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:34,890
away from here, Eunice.

35
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,963
- [Eunice] Don't go, Arthur.

36
00:03:35,963 --> 00:03:37,500
- I've got to, woman.

37
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,520
- If you can't do it for
me, do it for your son.

38
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,270
I can't raise him without a father.

39
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,840
- Are you gonna die, Daddy?

40
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,270
- Not if I can help it, son.

41
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,190
The Bible says know thine enemy.

42
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,373
He's cursed us all.

43
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,930
- I don't need you to remind me.

44
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,513
I watched two sisters die at his hand.

45
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,640
You and your brother hung him, he's dead.

46
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,153
Let his evil rest.

47
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:12,890
- He sent us a demon from hell.

48
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,275
It's killed the Barlows last night.

49
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:17,360
The streets of Oakmore
will run red with blood

50
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,900
if I can't be done with that thing.

51
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,563
- But vengeance is mine sayeth the lord.

52
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,593
- Then let him take his vengeance tonight.

53
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,450
Just before my daddy died,

54
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,950
he told me that the estuary
can protect folks against evil.

55
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,124
- Well what if he was wrong?

56
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:42,894
(footsteps clomping)

57
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:46,477
(somber, mysterious music)

58
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,750
- Take care of your mother, boy.

59
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,880
Always do what she tells you.

60
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,733
Always love her.

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,520
- Where you goin', Daddy?

62
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,120
- I've got somethin' to do, son.

63
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,880
- Can I come with you?

64
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,180
- No, I've gotta go alone.

65
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,730
But there is somethin' you can do.

66
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:13,029
Say a prayer for your
daddy tonight, you hear me?

67
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:16,612
(somber, mysterious music)

68
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,390
(birds chirping)

69
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,425
(thunder booming)
(Sean gasping)

70
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:53,925
(eerie music)

71
00:05:57,572 --> 00:06:02,572
(thunder booming)
(eerie music)

72
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,381
- Pumpkin Man.

73
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:36,298
(mysterious music)

74
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,100
(tense, suspenseful music)
(rhythmic banging)

75
00:08:33,727 --> 00:08:36,977
(bus brakes squealing)

76
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:42,652
- Dude, did you hear about that guy

77
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:44,090
that got flattened by that car?

78
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,002
- No.

79
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,133
- (laughing) Looked kinda like roadkill.

80
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,583
- Can we talk about
something else, that's gross.

81
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,090
- Hey, I bet ya that's
the head of Mr. Jack,

82
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,520
the Pumpkin Man.

83
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,420
- No, it's not.

84
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,120
- Is too, it's the Pumpkin
Man and he's gonna get you.

85
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,516
♪ Mr. Jack will snap your spine ♪

86
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:15,230
♪ Cut you in half with a scaly vine ♪

87
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,600
- Cut it out, my dad said
there's no Pumpkin Man.

88
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,770
- How do you know he's not lying?

89
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,640
He probably didn't tell
you about the witch either.

90
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,830
- [Sean] What witch?

91
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,450
- Robbie says he saw a witch
walking around the neighborhood

92
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,100
this morning, he's so full of it.

93
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,160
- Oh yeah, well here she comes again.

94
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,310
- Witches have brooms and
they don't drive cars.

95
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,323
- They do now.

96
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:39,795
- She's stopping!

97
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:40,795
- Follow me!

98
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,873
(car engine humming)

99
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,463
Now do you believe me?

100
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:53,800
She's looking for kids to eat.

101
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,760
- That's just a lady.

102
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,260
- Then what's she looking for?

103
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,410
This is what they used to do to witches,

104
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,060
they threw rocks at 'em,
tied 'em up, and burned 'em.

105
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,993
- Robbie, don't.

106
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:08,963
(rocks clattering)

107
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,100
- I'll get her this time.

108
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,707
- Robbie don't, you'll get us in trouble.

109
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:14,230
- Ow.

110
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,645
(Sean groaning)

111
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:17,837
I'll get you, Sean Kelly.

112
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:18,830
(Sean grunting)

113
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,922
You're a wuss, Sean Kelly.

114
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:23,589
(Sean grunting)

115
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,853
- Uh, Robbie, Robbie.

116
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:33,200
(Robbie yelling)

117
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,663
- Get off of him.

118
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,034
- [Sarah] See you later, Sean.

119
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,520
- Are you okay?

120
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,110
- Yeah.

121
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,573
- Thanks for saving my car.

122
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,420
- He can be mean sometimes.

123
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,550
- My name's Vivian, are you Sean?

124
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,393
- Sean Kelly.

125
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:54,170
- Can I give you a ride home, Sean?

126
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,680
- My dad won't let me ride with strangers,

127
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,690
I just live down the street.

128
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,570
- Can I walk with ya?

129
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,403
- Yeah.

130
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:02,236
- I'd like that.

131
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:06,322
(birds chirping)

132
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,300
- What happened to your clothes?

133
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,880
- Um, he stopped a boy
from vandalizing my car.

134
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
They got in a fight.

135
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,823
- Who with?

136
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,410
- Robbie.

137
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,200
Vivian pulled him off me.

138
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,810
- He's a lot bigger than you.

139
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,543
- Sean held his own quite well.

140
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,123
- Looks like you taught
him a lesson, Sean.

141
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:41,373
Go in and get cleaned up.

142
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,120
And don't tell Mom you got in a fight.

143
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:51,140
(chuckling) Moms sometimes
overreact to bloody noses

144
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,203
and scabby knees.

145
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,890
- He's a brave little boy.

146
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,313
- Sean's special.

147
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,800
- I'd love to see your spook house.

148
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,050
In fact, I'd really love
to help you with it.

149
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,453
- Well, we need all the help we can get.

150
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,180
I'd hate to impose.

151
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,180
(deep, scary music)

152
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,840
What brings you to our little burg?

153
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,180
- I'm doing some research on a book

154
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,090
for my great, great grandfather.

155
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,870
Actually, I was hoping to get
some perspective from you.

156
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,178
It seems your family was
connected to ours many years ago.

157
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:20,095
(car horn honking)

158
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,393
- Hey.

159
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,110
Honey, this is Vivian--

160
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,943
- Machen.

161
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:30,850
- She's doing a history of Oakmore

162
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,260
and she wants to know more
about the Kelly family.

163
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,930
And, she's offered to
help with the spook house.

164
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,980
- Well, you're gonna
have to stay for dinner.

165
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,474
We can't afford to pay you,
but we can at least feed you.

166
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:41,974
(scary music)

167
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,513
- [Walter] There's little
use in trying to resist me.

168
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:56,030
(footsteps crunching)

169
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,203
My will is much stronger than yours.

170
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,541
- Linda, where do you want this stuff?

171
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,513
(mysterious music)

172
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:08,858
(dramatic booming)

173
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:11,941
(tense, eerie music)

174
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,403
- Daniel, come on, we've
got the devil's work to do.

175
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:53,174
(scary music)

176
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:04,673
(cross thudding)

177
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:05,707
(tense music)

178
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,300
Daniel.

179
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,700
Jule, oh my god.

180
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:15,035
(tense, scary music)
(dramatic booming)

181
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:22,819
- Help, please, help us.
- Help.

182
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:24,863
- Please help us.

183
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:27,865
(deep, suspenseful music)

184
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:30,448
Please help us, please help us.

185
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:34,393
- Sean, are you all right?

186
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,653
You look like you saw a ghost.

187
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,363
- I had a scary dream.

188
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,243
- All dreams try to tell
us things, even bad ones.

189
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,000
Right now, your father tells me

190
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,920
your favorite television show is on.

191
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,360
Would you like to go watch?

192
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,193
- I guess so.

193
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,330
- Sean, baby, honey, are you okay?

194
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,220
- He had a bad dream.

195
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,270
I heard him call out so I went
in his room to check on him.

196
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,220
You're all right now, aren't you, Sean?

197
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,810
- So, what're you guys hungry for?

198
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,950
- I'm sorry, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to pass

199
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,783
on dinner tonight.

200
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:24,210
I, I have a prior commitment
I completely forgot about.

201
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,610
- [David] Oh well, maybe
we'll see you tomorrow.

202
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,853
- You can count on it.

203
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,083
Bye, Sean.

204
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:35,412
(mysterious music)

205
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:06,889
(insects chirping)

206
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:10,970
(can clanking)

207
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,233
- This really sucks.

208
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,520
- What sucks, Brent?

209
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,180
- [Brent] The old Oakmore
Cemetery's suppose to be

210
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,030
right over there.

211
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,523
- I don't see any graves.

212
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,803
- Well, I guess we'll just
have to look, come on.

213
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:35,171
(insects chirping)
(deep, eerie buzzing)

214
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,940
I saw an old map at the library.

215
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,730
This used to be the Kelly farm.

216
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,180
They had a little burial
plot out here somewhere.

217
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,410
And we're gonna find where
they buried their dead.

218
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,400
- This is the suburbs.

219
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,448
There aren't any dead
people in the suburbs.

220
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:01,287
(Brent chuckling)

221
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:02,950
- The brain dead.

222
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,110
- Yeah, they probably moved the bodies

223
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,870
when they built the houses.

224
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,963
- Shannon, can I move your body?

225
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,888
(can clunking)

226
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,010
That had beer in it.

227
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:21,452
(insects chirping)
(deep, eerie buzzing)

228
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,730
- Come on Paul, quit screwing around

229
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,330
and help us find the grave yard.

230
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:44,321
(deep, eerie buzzing)

231
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,263
- Cool.

232
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,809
Think I found somethin', somethin' old,

233
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:55,642
and dead.

234
00:18:58,227 --> 00:19:00,810
(Paul yelling)

235
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:07,710
(Brent sighing)

236
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,240
- Ever do it with a dead guy?

237
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,397
- I wouldn't like it,
you'd just lay there.

238
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:14,484
- You know you want me, don't fight it.

239
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:17,401
(Shannon scoffing)

240
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:21,312
(brush crunching)

241
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,100
- Hey, he did find something.

242
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,473
Daniel Kelly died in 1915.

243
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,820
- And there's two more over there.

244
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,320
I wonder what else we'll find.

245
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,373
- Evening folks, I'm a night
early but, happy Halloween.

246
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:43,900
(creepy music)

247
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,650
- Did you find that too terrifying?

248
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,407
I mean, has your mind ceased to believe

249
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,643
that which I've shown you to be true?

250
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,170
Let me remind you,

251
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:57,440
the human mind is capable
of almost anything.

252
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,250
From it, springs the
most wonderful of notions

253
00:20:01,214 --> 00:20:02,464
and the darkest of evils.

254
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,220
Welcome to my asylum of horrors.

255
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,053
Oh yes,

256
00:20:10,785 --> 00:20:15,118
the doctor is in. (laughing evilly)

257
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:21,524
(suspenseful music)
(creature groaning)

258
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:30,219
(deep, suspenseful music)

259
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:33,646
(television remote clicking)

260
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,237
- Almost time for bed, Sean Kelly.

261
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:37,400
- Can I watch Dr. Cadaver tomorrow

262
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,430
before I go trick or treating?

263
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,693
- We'll see, first you
have to try one of these.

264
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:42,900
- What are they?

265
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,003
- [David] Eyeballs.

266
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,374
- Gross.

267
00:20:47,374 --> 00:20:48,630
- Nice, juicy eyeballs.

268
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,850
I picked 'em fresh for you.

269
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,340
- Come on Dad, what are they really?

270
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,700
- Grapes for our haunted garage.

271
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,250
Come on, let's go check it out.

272
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,090
- You guys are just in time to
help me put this stuff away.

273
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,310
Ah, Linda my dear, Sean
and I are going into

274
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,330
the haunted garage.

275
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,820
And then it's straight
to bed, right, young man?

276
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,130
- What all this stuff for, Mom?

277
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,640
- Supplies for the spook house.

278
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,040
I've got corn syrup and
food coloring for blood,

279
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,187
cauliflower for brains,
and spaghetti for--

280
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:23,410
- Intestines.

281
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,910
- Very good, we'll make
a ghoul out of you yet.

282
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,338
Did you get ahold of a babysitter, Linda?

283
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:30,830
- What do I need a babysitter for?

284
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,910
- Your father and I have
to watch the garage, Sean,

285
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,640
and collect the money.

286
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,660
I know you're getting
too big for a babysitter,

287
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,750
but it's just somebody
to keep you company.

288
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,510
- Why do you have to collect
money, we've got money.

289
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,480
- But some people don't, sweetheart.

290
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,820
The neighbors will give us
money for the spook house

291
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,920
and then we'll give it
to the homeless shelter.

292
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,160
It's important to help people

293
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,040
who haven't been blessed like us.

294
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,380
- We're haunting the homeless.

295
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,213
- [Linda] David.

296
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,260
- Come on, we got work to do.

297
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,060
Uh, who are you calling, Linda?

298
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,819
- Carolyn, I couldn't
think of anybody else.

299
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,323
- Carolyn's nice.

300
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:03,743
- I think she likes me.

301
00:22:03,743 --> 00:22:05,970
- (chuckling) In your dreams, David.

302
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,020
Now get to work boys.

303
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:13,135
(tense, suspenseful music)

304
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:19,593
- Hey you guys, come here.

305
00:22:19,593 --> 00:22:23,093
(tense, mysterious music)

306
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:42,123
- Cool, a killer old cross.

307
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,220
Shannon, don't say I
never gave you anything.

308
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,750
- Leave it alone.

309
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,840
- Afraid of ghosts?

310
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,360
- Maybe they didn't move all the bodies.

311
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,110
Just a little respect for the dead.

312
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,123
- Maybe he's right.

313
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,320
Let's go see what else we can find.

314
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:02,983
(tense music)

315
00:23:16,441 --> 00:23:21,441
(Brent grunting)
(swishing)

316
00:23:23,955 --> 00:23:28,955
(water splattering)
(mysterious music)

317
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:00,130
- I have a hit of your cigarette?

318
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:00,963
- No way.

319
00:24:00,963 --> 00:24:01,838
- Jim, come on, please, just give me

320
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:02,800
a hit of your cigarette.
- No way.

321
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,910
- Come on.

322
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,858
- Buy your own.

323
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:08,858
(water splattering)

324
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:41,016
(phone keys beeping)

325
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:44,583
(telephone ringing)
(dog barking)

326
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,350
Hey, isn't that your sister's phone?

327
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,862
- She'll get it, don't worry about it.

328
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:48,695
(dog barking)
- You know,

329
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,528
I think she's in the shower,

330
00:24:49,528 --> 00:24:50,700
maybe I should get it for her.

331
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,305
- No, you are not going in
the shower with my sister.

332
00:24:54,305 --> 00:24:57,138
(telephone ringing)

333
00:24:57,138 --> 00:25:00,432
(water splattering)

334
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:05,432
- Julie, get the phone!

335
00:25:06,457 --> 00:25:11,124
(telephone ringing)
Julie get the phone!

336
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:16,253
Ugh, hello.

337
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,143
- Carolyn, Linda Kelly, everything okay?

338
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,130
- Yeah, my sister's home on break.

339
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,220
College education and I can't even get her

340
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,313
to answer the phone.

341
00:25:27,404 --> 00:25:30,890
(motorcycle engine revving)

342
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,030
Um, babysit for Sean tomorrow night?

343
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,730
Linda, I've got this
Halloween party to go to.

344
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,610
- Carolyn, I was counting on you.

345
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,571
How am I gonna find another
sitter this close to Halloween?

346
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:46,965
(motorcycle engine revving)

347
00:25:46,965 --> 00:25:51,180
- I'll uh, tell you what,
uh, the party's not till 10.

348
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,380
I'll bring Julie over
and show her the ropes,

349
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,580
I'll watch Sean until it's
time to go to the party

350
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,907
and then she can take over.

351
00:25:57,907 --> 00:25:59,540
(engine revving loudly)
Oh you'll like Julie,

352
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,757
she's really reliable, very mature.

353
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:07,107
(dog barking)

354
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,420
(motorcycle engine revving)

355
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,440
- [TV Announcer] And now
with tonight's commentary,

356
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,943
Dr. Tom Mason.

357
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,520
- I am sick and tired of real Americans

358
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,810
having to apologize
for not being homeless,

359
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,324
disabled, or a minority.

360
00:26:23,324 --> 00:26:26,553
(laughing) Where does this come from?

361
00:26:26,553 --> 00:26:29,213
(motorcycle engine humming)

362
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,250
- Oh, pure white trash.

363
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,968
Carolyn Miller moves in across the street

364
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,390
and our property values plummet.

365
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,810
- She's a divorced woman,
Amanda, simple as that.

366
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,543
We're lucky she doesn't have children.

367
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,773
- If she were a dog, I'd have her spayed.

368
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,150
(deep, suspenseful music)

369
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,919
- You finish your prayers?

370
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,140
- Yeah.

371
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,897
- Get under covers.

372
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:22,397
(deep, suspenseful music)

373
00:27:25,624 --> 00:27:26,457
- Dad.

374
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:27,557
- [David] Yes, son.

375
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:29,224
- Are monsters real?

376
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,900
- Well, monsters can be fun
like on the Dr. Cadaver show

377
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,480
or at Halloween, but there
aren't any real ones.

378
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,723
- What about Mr. Jack?

379
00:27:39,764 --> 00:27:40,897
- Who?

380
00:27:40,897 --> 00:27:42,550
- Mr. Jack, the Pumpkin Man.

381
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,881
Mr. Jack will break your back,

382
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:46,081
cut off you head with
a whack, whack, whack.

383
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,963
- Pumpkin Man will steal your soul,

384
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,063
he'll snatch it up and swallow it whole.

385
00:27:54,817 --> 00:27:56,317
I haven't heard that in years.

386
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,670
That's just an old rhyme
my grandma used to tell me

387
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,225
to keep me from getting into trouble.

388
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:04,760
- You used to get in trouble?

389
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,980
- Sure did, and we're
both gonna be in trouble

390
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,230
if your mom finds out
you're not asleep yet.

391
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,470
Close them eyes, boy.

392
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:13,563
- Okay.

393
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:16,480
(mysterious music)

394
00:28:25,552 --> 00:28:27,650
Then real quick before you die,

395
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,359
Mr. Jack will steal your eyes.

396
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,964
(scary booming)

397
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:35,881
(mysterious music)

398
00:28:38,688 --> 00:28:41,771
(tense, scary music)

399
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:57,699
- Well that wasn't too bad.

400
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,260
- Now you have to catch me.

401
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:04,803
- Don't go there. (sighing)

402
00:29:04,803 --> 00:29:07,886
(tense, scary music)

403
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,610
Paul, that is not funny.

404
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:27,059
(gasping)

405
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:27,892
- Boo.

406
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:31,486
(Paul chuckling)

407
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:34,986
(tense, mysterious music)

408
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:44,588
(thunder clapping)
(tense, mysterious music)

409
00:29:48,614 --> 00:29:51,281
(Sean groaning)

410
00:29:58,321 --> 00:29:59,154
- No.

411
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:02,645
(eerie music)

412
00:30:07,624 --> 00:30:10,207
(man groaning)

413
00:30:12,565 --> 00:30:16,119
(scary booming)
(man grunting)

414
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:19,452
(man breathing heavily)

415
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:28,477
(thudding)

416
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:30,977
(tense music)

417
00:30:33,094 --> 00:30:35,973
(man groaning)

418
00:30:35,973 --> 00:30:39,056
(tense, eerie music)

419
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,733
- I am the judge of the hill.

420
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:08,420
Not everyone is lucky enough
to get my special attention.

421
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,337
(thunder rumbling)

422
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,460
(deep rumbling)
(bell tolling)

423
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,710
(laughing)

424
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:23,997
- What's the problem?

425
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:26,530
- [Brent] (chuckling) Shut up.

426
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,907
(deep rumbling)
(tense music)

427
00:31:29,907 --> 00:31:32,076
(beer can tab popping)

428
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:37,076
(deep rumbling)
(bell tolling)

429
00:31:40,806 --> 00:31:45,806
(fierce growling)
(suspenseful music)

430
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:58,114
(deep, tense music)

431
00:32:06,411 --> 00:32:09,078
(Sean groaning)

432
00:32:11,636 --> 00:32:12,469
- [Walter] I have found them guilty

433
00:32:12,469 --> 00:32:14,223
and the punishment is death.

434
00:32:17,238 --> 00:32:19,035
- Help me, Sean.

435
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:22,505
(static buzzing)

436
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:23,672
Help me, Sean.

437
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:30,088
(static buzzing)
(suspenseful music)

438
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:37,542
- [Walter] You must do as I've
found, kill them, kill them.

439
00:32:37,813 --> 00:32:42,813
(tense music)
(rhythmic banging)

440
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,290
- What was that noise?

441
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,070
(tense music)
(rhythmic banging)

442
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,170
- [Paul] Brent burped.

443
00:32:51,311 --> 00:32:56,311
(tense music)
(rhythmic banging)

444
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,855
- You guys, can we go now?

445
00:33:04,855 --> 00:33:06,486
(swishing)
(slashing)

446
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:09,295
(gagging)

447
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:11,321
(yelling)

448
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:14,037
(yelling)

449
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:18,084
(thudding)
(Paul gagging)

450
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:20,417
(screaming)

451
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,456
(Shannon crying out)

452
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:30,442
(adventurous music)

453
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:35,442
(Shannon crying out)
(adventurous music)

454
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,117
(scary music)

455
00:33:49,117 --> 00:33:53,134
Uh! (crying)

456
00:33:54,437 --> 00:33:58,241
(tense, scary music)

457
00:33:58,241 --> 00:34:02,741
(swishing)
(thudding)

458
00:34:04,815 --> 00:34:06,662
(banging)

459
00:34:06,662 --> 00:34:08,130
- No!

460
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:13,130
(eerie music)
(thunder rumbling)

461
00:34:24,948 --> 00:34:27,698
(heavy thudding)

462
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:35,571
(tense, eerie music)

463
00:34:50,227 --> 00:34:54,093
- I'm sorry you find my
justice so difficult to accept.

464
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,666
My power is much greater
than even I believed.

465
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:04,666
(thunder rumbling)
(mysterious music)

466
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,827
(eerie swishing)

467
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,827
(deep, tense music)

468
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:36,429
(motorcycle engine roaring)

469
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:44,110
- Carolyn.

470
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,053
- How's my boyfriend?

471
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,143
Ooh, you look so scary.

472
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,883
Yard looks great.

473
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,003
- Well, I try.

474
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,480
- You're like a little boy
about all this scary stuff.

475
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,003
- I guess it keeps me young.

476
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,073
- I like little boys.

477
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,393
- That's a nice bike
your friend has there.

478
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,690
- Can I go look at it?

479
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,103
- Look uh, but don't touch.

480
00:36:29,194 --> 00:36:30,281
(Jim moaning)

481
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:31,281
- Neat bike.

482
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,280
- You like bikes, kid?

483
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,160
Go ahead, check it out.

484
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,340
- Well I guess I better
go talk to your daddy.

485
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,940
I get to be your babysitter too.

486
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,253
- Cool.

487
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,800
- So, you ever ridden one of these?

488
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,853
- No, not lately.

489
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,267
- Come on kid, climb aboard.

490
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:58,750
(motorcycle engine roaring)

491
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:07,703
- Seah, uh Sean.

492
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:10,760
(motorcycle engine revving)

493
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,860
- He's all right, Jim's a real safe biker.

494
00:37:15,286 --> 00:37:18,953
(motorcycle engine roaring)

495
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,920
- Hi Carolyn.

496
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,753
- Hi.

497
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:41,093
- And you must be Julie.

498
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,850
What's that noise?

499
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,080
(motorcycle engine humming)

500
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,203
Sean, get off that bike right now!

501
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,683
- Don't worry, Mrs.
Kelly, he's safe with Jim.

502
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,860
- David, how could you let this happen?

503
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,320
- I, I said he could
look at the damn thing,

504
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,533
I didn't say he could ride it.

505
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:05,910
(Linda groaning)

506
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,723
- See you at seven, Linda, if that's okay.

507
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:16,442
(animal howling)

508
00:38:21,076 --> 00:38:24,560
(doorbell ringing)

509
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,090
- Well hi Vivian, come on in.

510
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:26,950
- Hi.

511
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,673
- Ready for a spooky Halloween?

512
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,673
- Yes.

513
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,390
- What's with the book?

514
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,040
- This old family Bible got
me started on my project.

515
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,897
- [David] Oh, I love those old pictures.

516
00:38:44,897 --> 00:38:47,480
(game beeping)

517
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:55,843
- Sean.

518
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,823
Come here, this might interest you.

519
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,973
- Who's he?

520
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,163
- Just some creepy lookin' old guy, why?

521
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,743
- I saw him in my dream.

522
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,850
- His name was Walter Machen.

523
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,670
- You must've seen his
picture somewhere before.

524
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,920
Isn't that right, Vivian?

525
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:48,939
(tense, suspenseful music)

526
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,140
- These are the kind of tales
that drove Edgar Allan Poe

527
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,920
to the brink of madness.

528
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,833
I'd better go easy on you at first,

529
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,093
I don't wanna scare you off.

530
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:10,003
I want you to sit back and observe.

531
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,390
Welcome to my asylum of horrors,

532
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,023
the doctor is in.

533
00:40:17,907 --> 00:40:21,407
(deep, suspenseful music)

534
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,290
- Our grandparents never talked
much about the good old days

535
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,770
and we weren't allowed to ask.

536
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:28,970
Were our families close?

537
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,133
- In a way.

538
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,150
Walter Machen was accused of sorcery.

539
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,330
He was linked to the disappearance

540
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,690
of many innocent townsfolk.

541
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,980
81 years ago this night,
Arthur and Daniel Kelly

542
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,720
led the mob that lynched Walter Machen.

543
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,350
- That's terrible.

544
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:50,800
- Before the rope bit into his
neck, Walter vowed revenge.

545
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,410
He said the streets of Oakmore Crossing

546
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,840
would run red with the
blood of the Kelly clan,

547
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,860
or anyone connected with
them, within one year's time.

548
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:03,090
According to legend, his
prophecy almost came true.

549
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:08,090
Halloween night, 1915,
something came out of the ground

550
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,233
and took Machen's bloody revenge.

551
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,793
- You said almost.

552
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,270
- Arthur Kelly stopped the evil thing

553
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,370
Machen raised up from hell,

554
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,720
he stopped its mission of vengeance,

555
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,320
but at the cost of his own life.

556
00:41:25,101 --> 00:41:27,140
Mind you, most of it's just legend.

557
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,580
I'm just trying to
separate fact from fiction.

558
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,300
- What about my ancestors,

559
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,060
you said they lynched Walter Machen?

560
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,520
- Oh that part's true, but don't worry,

561
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,083
time heals all wounds.

562
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,053
- Quiet, I can't hear the movie.

563
00:41:43,053 --> 00:41:46,290
- [Woman On TV] Blood running
red down my soft skin.

564
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,990
Always the blood and the terror.

565
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,180
My soul cried out for release,

566
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,898
but for release into a
world of fire and torment.

567
00:41:54,898 --> 00:41:58,670
And I knew that they were
there, clutching, grasping,

568
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,975
tearing at their own flesh and
the flesh of their victims.

569
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:03,210
And I would soon be--

570
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,580
- David, honey, could you
give me a hand, please.

571
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,609
- [Woman On TV] Left
my body, as the fire--

572
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,000
- Let me know how it ends.

573
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,390
- Can I go trick or treating now?

574
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,293
- As soon as Carolyn and Julie get here.

575
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,210
- [Woman On TV] My flesh
nourishing their twisted souls,

576
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:19,567
my death bringing life to the coven.

577
00:42:21,484 --> 00:42:24,984
(somber orchestral music)

578
00:42:29,415 --> 00:42:31,420
- I've come to drink your blood.

579
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,460
- David, how long is she gonna be here?

580
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,730
- Oh I don't know, I guess till
we close the haunted house.

581
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,650
- She makes me really uncomfortable.

582
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,550
All this talk about curses
and blood in the streets.

583
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,620
- That's just the stuff that sells books.

584
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,903
It's Halloween, lighten up.

585
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:55,370
- Linda, can I help you with something?

586
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:59,940
- Oh, Vivian, uh, no, no
thanks, we're all set.

587
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,440
(tense music)

588
00:43:08,832 --> 00:43:11,749
(insects chirping)

589
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,320
- They say that there are
only two things in life

590
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,611
that are certain, death and taxes.

591
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:23,640
(laughing) What a load of
liberal crap, I tell you.

592
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,620
Why should I give my
money to the government

593
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,410
when they aren't giving me any of theirs?

594
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,895
- That's so true, that's what
I've always said, Richard.

595
00:43:29,895 --> 00:43:32,123
(TV audience applauding)
Why are people so blind?

596
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,900
(creature growling)

597
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,940
- What's the matter?

598
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,150
- Dad says the Watsons are mean.

599
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,550
- Mr. Watson owns a grocery store,

600
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,100
he's gotta have the best candy.

601
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:47,487
(knocking at door)
(TV audience applauding)

602
00:43:47,487 --> 00:43:49,810
- Oh, little monsters.

603
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,300
- Did you leave the porch light on?

604
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,810
- Must I do everything for you?

605
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:55,643
- Yes.

606
00:43:55,643 --> 00:43:56,476

the Glenn Miller favorites style.

609
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,883
- [Richard] I'm coming
you little parasites.

610
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,280
- [Both] Trick or treat.

611
00:44:06,304 --> 00:44:07,990
- You looking for a handout?

612
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,760
- Yes sir, we'd like some candy.

613
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,060
- Oh, you want some candy.

614
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,493
Does this look like a candy store?

615
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,980
I make my living selling food.

616
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:22,093
You want something from
me, you pay for it, got it?

617
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,580
Good, now get outta here.

618
00:44:25,503 --> 00:44:28,420
(insects chirping)

619
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,960
- Man, that guy's creepy,
creepier than Dr. Cadaver.

620
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,450
- He's just mean.

621
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,120
- Hey, I got an idea.

622
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,630
No treat, so it's time for a trick.

623
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,630
(insects chirping)

624
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:46,874
(Richard groaning)
- Learn from an expert,

625
00:44:46,874 --> 00:44:50,463
learn from Del Bugercasher,
he's been playing guitar

626
00:44:50,463 --> 00:44:55,111
for over four years (muffled
by footsteps crunching).

627
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:56,583
But you'll learn favorites
just the way he learned--

628
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:57,640
- What was that sound?

629
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,141
- [TV Announcer] And you'll love 'em.

630
00:45:00,141 --> 00:45:03,558
(deep, mysterious music)

631
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:09,055

633
00:45:13,808 --> 00:45:16,808
(deep, tense music)

634
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:23,368
Hey, hey I know who you
are and I saw what you did!

636

Hey, get outta the yard!

(eerie music)

642
00:46:01,321 --> 00:46:02,571
The realm dies.

643
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:09,828
- We aim to spook.

644
00:46:10,843 --> 00:46:13,010
(hissing)

645
00:46:16,521 --> 00:46:19,021

(tense music)

653
00:47:10,215 --> 00:47:11,527
- [Woman On TV] Anyways,
the ancestors made sentinels

654
00:47:11,527 --> 00:47:13,199
out of the charred, rotting bodies

655
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:15,320
of those ancient sorcerers.

656
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,370
Yet to me, they still lived on,

657
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:19,973
the voices of the dead
coven called out to me.

658
00:47:20,943 --> 00:47:22,622
(dramatic swishing)

- Sounds like our first
batch of trick or treaters.

664
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:47,397
Everybody look spooky,
let's go get 'em. (laughing)

665
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,089
The door is stuck again.

Sorry we're late, but
Julie and her boyfriend

671
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,210
just had to fit in a game of pool.

672
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,930
- [Sean] You're not trick or treaters.

673
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,260
- Sure we are.

674
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,963

(insects chirping)

676
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,360
Carolyn, Julie, you don't mind taking Sean

677
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,640
trick or treating for awhile, do you?

678
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,040
- No, not at all.

679
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,546
- Good, 'cause Linda and I've
gotta open the spook house.

680
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:39,845
Come on Vivian, you're in for a treat.

681
00:48:39,845 --> 00:48:41,970
- (laughing) You guys help yourself,

682
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:43,760
it's open season on the fridge.

683
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,763
- Got any beer?

684
00:48:45,698 --> 00:48:48,531
(Linda chuckling)

685
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:54,130
- Okay, Pumpkin Man, are you ready?

686
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,280
- I'll go get my mask.

687
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,310
- [Carolyn] Okay, hurry up,
'cause you're burnin' moonlight.

688
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,993
- Oh, this is so white-bread.

689
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:04,323
- I know, but just play
along with me, okay.

690
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,580
- Maybe if more children

691
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,930
were taken away from their unfit parents.

692
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:15,730
I think it's time that we
try a little hard love.

693
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:17,600
Not all of us were born with love

694
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,710
and respect for fine things.

695
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,470
No, we aren't all born with it, hardly.

696
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:22,940
You've seen the world we are in today.

697
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,237
We're hardly born with that,

698
00:49:24,237 --> 00:49:26,740
some have to learn in the hard way.

699
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,370
Oh, love all your neighbors,
certainly, love your neighbors,

700
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,670
if they're real Americans.

701
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,210
But if they're bleeding
heart liberals, huh,

702
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,580
then they don't deserve to live,

703
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,020
they don't deserve to breathe the air

704
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,230
that you could be breathing.

705
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:42,133
Just think of that,
they're stealing your air.

706
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:43,983
(static buzzing)

707
00:49:43,983 --> 00:49:45,735
- Oh, Richard.

708
00:49:45,735 --> 00:49:47,820
(Richard sighing)

709
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,170
- The antenna must be down.

710
00:49:54,222 --> 00:49:56,280
- We should get cable.

711
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,560
- Tool of the liberal media, Amanda.

712
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,810
We'll get cable when
they prior the antenna

713
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,643
out of my cold, dead hands.

714
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:04,916
- Shut up.

715
00:50:06,027 --> 00:50:06,860
(laughing)

716
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,000
On your knees, hell pigs.

717
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,283
Duck!

718
00:50:10,283 --> 00:50:13,302
(hubcap clanging)

719
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:14,813
- Oh, they're back for more.

720
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,206
- I'll make some more toast
while you answer the door.

721
00:50:20,206 --> 00:50:23,111
(door clicking open)

722
00:50:23,111 --> 00:50:26,694
(suspenseful, scary music)

723
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,555
(dishes clinking)

724
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:55,388
Damn rug.

725
00:50:56,224 --> 00:50:59,991
(suspenseful music)

726
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:01,630
(toaster buzzing)
Oh!

727
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:04,573
Richard, you have got to get that fixed.

728
00:51:05,623 --> 00:51:08,713
(suspenseful, scary music)

729
00:51:08,713 --> 00:51:13,713
- Where's my hubcap?

730
00:51:15,407 --> 00:51:17,813
All right you yellow rat bastards.

731
00:51:19,107 --> 00:51:22,957
I don't care how long it
takes me, I'm gonna find you,

732
00:51:22,957 --> 00:51:25,392
and I'll make your parents pay.

733
00:51:25,392 --> 00:51:29,316
(brush crunching)
(scary banging)

734
00:51:29,316 --> 00:51:33,393
A little big for trick or
treating, aren't you, bucko?

735
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:36,476
(tense, scary music)

736
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,909
Get outta my yard or I'll cut your belly--

737
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:40,742
(scythe thudding)

738
00:51:40,742 --> 00:51:43,490
(Richard gasping)
(hubcap clanking)

739
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,128
Ah!

740
00:51:45,128 --> 00:51:48,211
(tense, scary music)

741
00:51:53,005 --> 00:51:55,965
(Richard gagging)

742
00:51:55,965 --> 00:51:58,965
(deep, scary music)

743
00:52:06,605 --> 00:52:07,815
(thudding)

744
00:52:07,815 --> 00:52:10,898
(tense, scary music)

745
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,233
- Richard?

746
00:52:17,897 --> 00:52:19,547
You gonna be out there all night?

747
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,283
Richard?

748
00:52:25,282 --> 00:52:26,933
Richard.

749
00:52:26,933 --> 00:52:30,016
(tense, scary music)

750
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,423
(yelling)

751
00:52:35,423 --> 00:52:39,006
(scary, adventurous music)

752
00:52:43,467 --> 00:52:45,134
I've gotta get away.

753
00:52:48,426 --> 00:52:50,422
I've gotta get away.

754
00:52:50,422 --> 00:52:51,255
(Amanda crying out)

755
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:56,255
(toaster sizzling)
(Amanda yelling)

756
00:53:01,268 --> 00:53:04,851
(tense, frightening music)

757
00:53:22,253 --> 00:53:25,920
(motorcycle engine revving)

758
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,500
- What's Julie doing in the bathroom?

759
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,643
- Girl stuff.

760
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:46,230
Julie, come on, Sean wants
to go trick or treating,

761
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,972
and I've got places to go.

762
00:53:48,972 --> 00:53:52,910
(motorcycle engine humming)

763
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:53,983
Julie.

764
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,473
Julie?

765
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:08,951
(motorcycle engine humming)

766
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,603
Beer run, bye.

767
00:54:29,671 --> 00:54:30,504
Great.

768
00:54:31,414 --> 00:54:32,247
(Sean growling)

769
00:54:32,247 --> 00:54:35,080
(Carolyn gasping)

770
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,030
Okay, let's go trick or treat.

771
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:38,863
- [Sean] Yes!

772
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:47,286
(insects chirping)

773
00:54:50,365 --> 00:54:52,523
- Ooh, the Watsons put
up decorations after all.

774
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:54,020
- That's not scary,

775
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,780
maybe they just want kids
to come up to the door

776
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,560
so they can yell at 'em.

777
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,072
Come on, the haunted garage'll be better.

778
00:55:00,072 --> 00:55:03,072
(deep, scary music)

779
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,280
(door clicking open)

780
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,383
- Trick or treat. (laughing evilly)

781
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,153
I've been expecting you,
Sean. (laughing evilly)

782
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:22,010
Evening, Carolyn, happy Halloween.

783
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:26,220
Sean, didn't you forget to say something?

784
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:31,220
Trick or treat. (laughing)

785
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,250
- Don't hold me so tight, baby,

786
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,923
you're cuttin' off my circulation.

787
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:42,463
- Really?

788
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:45,893
I thought you could
handle a little bondage.

789
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,453
- Maybe I can.

790
00:55:50,459 --> 00:55:53,626
(deep, scary buzzing)

791
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:58,133
You playin' rough, baby?

792
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:00,703
- Maybe.

793
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,940
- Just remember somethin', I bite back.

794
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,529
(deep, scary buzzing)

795
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:15,205
(tense, mysterious music)

796
00:56:39,513 --> 00:56:41,470
Hey, what're you doin',
what's the matter, baby?

797
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,397
What's the matter?

798
00:56:42,397 --> 00:56:43,330
- I think somebody's out there.

799
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,300
I think we should go back to the Kelly's.

800
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,990
- No, come here, come here.

801
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,600
- Not right now.

802
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,300
- Come on, what's the matter with?

803
00:56:55,798 --> 00:56:58,098
I'm goin' to get beer,
get your own ride back.

804
00:57:01,116 --> 00:57:03,019
(motorcycle engine roaring)

805
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:03,852
- Jim.

806
00:57:05,234 --> 00:57:08,651
(deep, mysterious music)

807
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:30,176
- Welcome to the Kellys' haunted
garage, enter if you dare.

808
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:33,790
- Hi, Mr. Kelly.

809
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:36,512
- [David] That's Count Kelly, kid.

810
00:57:36,512 --> 00:57:37,612
- This better be good.

811
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,440
- Ah, children of the night,

812
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,837
you are either very brave or very foolish.

813
00:57:45,013 --> 00:57:47,096
Esmarelda, more children.

814
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,130
- Mm, I love children,
especially flame-broiled.

815
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:01,508
(deep, scary music)

816
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:08,366
(insects chirping)

817
00:58:15,442 --> 00:58:18,442
(deep, tense music)

818
00:58:30,363 --> 00:58:32,863
(eerie music)

819
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:39,719
(scary swishing)

820
00:58:43,114 --> 00:58:44,995
- Let's go see the man turned inside out.

821
00:58:44,995 --> 00:58:46,245
- That's gross.

822
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:53,993
- Feels fake.

823
00:58:56,276 --> 00:58:59,671
(scary growling)

824
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:03,252
(Robbie yelling)

825
00:59:03,252 --> 00:59:05,213
- (laughing) I guess we got him good.

826
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:08,110
- Perhaps it was something else.

827
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:10,240
- You know, she's right, David,

828
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,100
maybe those kids wrecked something.

829
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,456
You better go check it out.

830
00:59:13,456 --> 00:59:17,123
- [Ghostly Voice] Welcome
to realm, join us.

831
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:22,570
- That could've been the Pumpkin Man.

832
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,930
- It wasn't, now can we please go home?

833
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:26,797
- No, I want more candy.

834
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:32,103
- [Ghostly Voice] Come join us.

835
00:59:32,103 --> 00:59:34,423
- It's dark and scary in here, mommy.

836
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,650
I can't see a thing.

837
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,083
- That's the whole idea.

838
00:59:41,221 --> 00:59:46,221
- [Ghostly Voice] Welcome
to the realm, join us.

839
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:48,754
Join.

840
00:59:50,692 --> 00:59:53,942
- The heart's still in the right place.

841
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:57,713
- David, what are you doing in there?

842
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,814
- I'm feeling my guts.

843
01:00:00,814 --> 01:00:03,147
(chuckling)

844
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:09,240
No damage, maybe it just scared 'em,

845
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:13,305
scared 'em real good. (laughing)

846
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:15,972
(scary booming)

847
01:00:30,103 --> 01:00:33,186
(objects clattering)

848
01:00:39,354 --> 01:00:41,660
Well I didn't find any body parts.

849
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,464
At least not real ones.

850
01:00:43,464 --> 01:00:48,464
(fabric ripping)
(glass clinking)

851
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,370
- Something's been here.

852
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:51,483
- Yeah, David.

853
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,310
Uh, what a neighborhood
full of kids couldn't do

854
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:56,543
in one night, you managed in two minutes.

855
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,691
Well, I guess I gotta
close the spook show.

856
01:01:00,691 --> 01:01:03,858
(tense, creepy music)

857
01:01:09,381 --> 01:01:11,848
(bird howling)

858
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:14,931
(tense, scary music)

859
01:01:26,379 --> 01:01:28,879
(tense music)

860
01:01:47,889 --> 01:01:50,806
(mysterious music)

861
01:02:00,985 --> 01:02:03,664
(thudding)

862
01:02:03,664 --> 01:02:06,414
(frogs croaking)

863
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:13,610
(mysterious music)

864
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:15,377
- I wanna go home, I think we're lost.

865
01:02:15,377 --> 01:02:16,998
- No, we're not.

866
01:02:16,998 --> 01:02:18,780
The old cemetery's down the road.

867
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,530
That's where the Pumpkin Man lives.

868
01:02:21,372 --> 01:02:23,870
(muffled growling)

869
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:24,820
- I think I heard something.

870
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,746
- It's just somebody trying to scare us.

871
01:02:27,746 --> 01:02:30,329
(creepy music)

872
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,402
Is that you, Sean Kelly?

873
01:02:33,402 --> 01:02:35,263
You're still a wuss.

874
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:38,180
(muffled growling)

875
01:02:40,581 --> 01:02:43,400
(tense music)

876
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,006
(laughing evilly)

877
01:02:46,006 --> 01:02:49,589
(Robbie and Sarah yelling)

878
01:02:54,527 --> 01:02:57,022
- What'd you do that for?

879
01:02:57,022 --> 01:02:58,270
- Come on, baby, it ain't Halloween

880
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:01,164
if you can't scare a
few kids once in awhile.

881
01:03:01,164 --> 01:03:03,340
(brush crunching)

882
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,240
Hey, you still mad at me?

883
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:09,560
- No, but can we go
back to the Kelly's now?

884
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,363
- Just a second, I gotta check
my throttle, it's sticking.

885
01:03:14,061 --> 01:03:16,978
(insects chirping)

886
01:03:23,561 --> 01:03:24,394
- Uh, no.

887
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,180
Slow down, Mrs. Stephens,
you're saying Sarah and Robbie

888
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:33,783
saw dead bodies and a monster
all over the neighborhood.

889
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:35,883
It's Halloween.

890
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:38,680
No, no, I'm sure it's just,

891
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:42,053
no, Sean went trick or treating.

892
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,373
Okay, I'll check it out, thanks.

893
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,790
- Is there a problem?

894
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,220
- Hm, some of the neighborhood kids

895
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,753
saw dead bodies and a monster.

896
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:57,203
I better go track down Sean.

897
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:00,070
Tell Linda I went to look for him.

898
01:04:06,687 --> 01:04:10,925
(tense, suspenseful music)
(swishing)

899
01:04:10,925 --> 01:04:13,049
- What was that?

900
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,353
- Huh?

901
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:15,353
- I heard something.

902
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,213
- Give it a rest, Jim.

903
01:04:19,365 --> 01:04:20,448
- No, really.

904
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,662
(tense, suspenseful music)

905
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:44,414
(swishing)

906
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:47,997
(tense, suspenseful music)

907
01:04:55,716 --> 01:04:58,049
Huh, nice costume, butthead.

908
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,215
You're scaring my girlfriend,
now get the hell outta here.

909
01:05:02,215 --> 01:05:04,715
(tense music)

910
01:05:10,142 --> 01:05:12,809
I said, get the hell outta here.

911
01:05:17,416 --> 01:05:18,692
(scythe thudding)

912
01:05:18,692 --> 01:05:21,775
(tense, scary music)

913
01:05:31,657 --> 01:05:34,324
(Julie gasping)

914
01:05:39,057 --> 01:05:40,057
- Oh my god.

915
01:05:44,604 --> 01:05:47,854
(truck engine humming)

916
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:02,414
(footsteps clicking)

917
01:06:10,888 --> 01:06:11,721
- What?

918
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:15,128
- It got Jim, it got,
we've gotta get outta here.

919
01:06:15,128 --> 01:06:15,961
Come on.

920
01:06:17,505 --> 01:06:18,988
Would you get in the car?

921
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:20,994
There's something out there!

922
01:06:20,994 --> 01:06:24,077
Would you please just get in the car!

923
01:06:26,293 --> 01:06:28,104
There's something out there!

924
01:06:28,104 --> 01:06:30,194
Would you just get in the car!

925
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:33,861
- Hey, calm down, there's
nothing out there.

926
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,291
(Julie screaming)

927
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:39,650
(scythe thudding)

928
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:41,907
(gagging)

929
01:06:41,907 --> 01:06:46,857
- Oh my god! (yelling)

930
01:06:54,784 --> 01:06:59,784
(tense, somber music)
(rhythmic banging)

931
01:06:59,794 --> 01:07:03,327
(Roscoe whining)

932
01:07:03,327 --> 01:07:04,940
- What's the matter, Roscoe?

933
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:08,343
(Roscoe whining)

934
01:07:08,343 --> 01:07:11,187
You hear the boogie man? (laughing)

935
01:07:12,934 --> 01:07:17,934
(Roscoe whining)
(scary swishing)

936
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,833
David, you nearly scared me to death.

937
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,270
- Couldn't find you out front.

938
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:29,780
Some of the neighborhood
kids said they saw monsters

939
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,203
and dead bodies out here.

940
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,310
I'm trying to find
Sean, have you seen him?

941
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:38,200
- He was here with Carolyn
early this evening.

942
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,605
I scared the hell outta them. (laughing)

943
01:07:42,605 --> 01:07:44,438
- They say where they were goin'?

944
01:07:44,438 --> 01:07:45,910
- It's Halloween, David,

945
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:50,230
I figure they're out lookin'
for candy. (laughing)

946
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:51,093
- Thanks.

947
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:53,563
- Trick or treat.

948
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,173
- [Woman] How much you got in there?

949
01:08:02,885 --> 01:08:04,280
- Where are you, Julie?

950
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,390
- What?

951
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:08,250
- Oh nothing, Sean, what'd
you get at the last house?

952
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,420
- Just juice.

953
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,974
- Well you'll need that to
wash down all that candy.

954
01:08:11,974 --> 01:08:13,100
(juice thudding)

955
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:13,933
Oh, come on.

956
01:08:17,942 --> 01:08:20,192
(growling)

957
01:08:22,252 --> 01:08:25,169
(insects chirping)

958
01:08:45,756 --> 01:08:48,970
(knocking at door)

959
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:50,740
- There's no sign of Sean.

960
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:53,050
- Someone's been in his room, look.

961
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:56,125
Where have you been, I've
been looking all over for you.

962
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:58,120
- I've been out looking for Sean.

963
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,407
Didn't Vivian tell you?

964
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:04,722
(mysterious music)

965
01:09:10,192 --> 01:09:12,410
- It's gettin' late and I
don't see any other kids.

966
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:14,250
- We waited too long.

967
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,980
- Well let's start back, it's a long walk.

968
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,201
- I know a shortcut through the park.

969
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:22,118
(mysterious music)

970
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:33,680
(Carolyn yelling)
(Sean groaning)

971
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,545
(Carolyn grunting)

972
01:09:36,545 --> 01:09:37,962
- Run, Sean, run!

973
01:09:39,387 --> 01:09:42,233
(adventurous music)

974
01:09:42,233 --> 01:09:43,483
Run, Sean, run.

975
01:09:44,744 --> 01:09:46,244
Get away from him!

976
01:09:47,144 --> 01:09:48,977
Get out of here!

977
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:51,435
(scythe swooshing)

978
01:09:51,435 --> 01:09:53,760
(thudding)

979
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,260
(eerie music)

980
01:09:57,809 --> 01:10:02,809
(adventurous music)
(Sean panting)

981
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:27,290
(deep, frightening music)

982
01:10:32,412 --> 01:10:35,329
(mysterious music)

983
01:10:45,559 --> 01:10:48,082
(Sean gasping)

984
01:10:48,082 --> 01:10:51,582
(slow, suspenseful music)

985
01:11:04,027 --> 01:11:07,425
(Sean groaning)

986
01:11:07,425 --> 01:11:09,925
(scary music)

987
01:11:16,312 --> 01:11:18,979
(Sean groaning)

988
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,610
- You know what's going on here.

989
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:27,160
Now what the hell is happening?

990
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:31,290
- Walter Machen cursed
your family and mine

991
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:32,823
when he raised his demon.

992
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:39,010
Your ancestor, Arthur Kelly,
thought he killed the monster,

993
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:40,000
but he was wrong.

994
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,900
- You know, I've had
enough of your fairy tales

995
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,020
and spooky stories.

996
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:45,610
Where is our son?

997
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:49,510
- He's out there, drawing
the monster to him.

998
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,750
I let Sean be a decoy.

999
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,609
It's the only way to find
the monster, flush it out,

1000
01:11:54,609 --> 01:11:55,767
and destroy it.

1001
01:11:55,767 --> 01:11:58,563
- Linda, this is pointless, she's insane.

1002
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:02,920
- Why do you think I'm here?

1003
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,493
I'm hunting this demon.

1004
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:09,690
A family prophecy says that
only the fifth male descendant

1005
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:12,700
after Arthur Kelly can
destroy this creature.

1006
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,680
That would be your son.

1007
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:15,513
- Sean.

1008
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:19,400
- I knew the demon would rise again,

1009
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,373
and seek out the fifth son after Arthur.

1010
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:27,373
It has to kill Sean before Sean kills it.

1011
01:12:31,312 --> 01:12:34,312
(adventurous music)

1012
01:12:37,918 --> 01:12:39,582
(Sean grunting)

1013
01:12:39,582 --> 01:12:41,255
(scythe thudding)

1014
01:12:41,255 --> 01:12:44,255
(adventurous music)

1015
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,289
- Maybe I oughta check
the neighborhood again.

1016
01:12:55,289 --> 01:12:56,560
There's a few houses I might've missed.

1017
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,990
- David, call the police.

1018
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:01,080
- The police can't help you.

1019
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,330
They're powerless against the demon.

1020
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:06,582
- Vivian, shut the hell up.

1021
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:09,749
(tense, somber music)

1022
01:13:13,884 --> 01:13:16,034
(adventurous music)
- Help, help!

1023
01:13:16,034 --> 01:13:17,865
(thudding)
- That was Sean.

1024
01:13:17,865 --> 01:13:21,352
(adventurous music)

1025
01:13:21,352 --> 01:13:22,240
- [Sean] Let me in.

1026
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:25,221
(adventurous music)

1027
01:13:25,221 --> 01:13:27,764
Pumpkin Man's coming.

1028
01:13:27,764 --> 01:13:29,340
Let me in.

1029
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,173
- [Linda] Is it stuck?

1030
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:32,463
- [David] The damn door's stuck again.

1031
01:13:32,463 --> 01:13:34,660
- [Sean] Don't let him get me.

1032
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:38,139
(adventurous music)

1033
01:13:38,139 --> 01:13:41,163
(scary music)

1034
01:13:41,163 --> 01:13:43,197
(blood splattering)

1035
01:13:43,197 --> 01:13:45,697
(tense music)

1036
01:13:49,368 --> 01:13:50,201
- My god, where's Sean?

1037
01:13:50,201 --> 01:13:51,720
- There's no sign of him.

1038
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,123
How could he disappear?

1039
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:57,183
- No.

1040
01:13:58,326 --> 01:14:01,243
(insects chirping)

1041
01:14:10,452 --> 01:14:11,285
No.

1042
01:14:13,187 --> 01:14:14,120
- It's not blood.

1043
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,050
- Where is our son?

1044
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,130
- You're wasting your time, Linda.

1045
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:17,850
She doesn't give a damn about anybody,

1046
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:19,140
certainly not Sean.

1047
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,690
- You're wrong, David,
I'll help you find Sean.

1048
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:25,375
But you're going to need to
do exactly what I tell you.

1049
01:14:25,375 --> 01:14:26,590
(Linda crying)

1050
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:27,423
- Let's go.

1051
01:14:29,188 --> 01:14:32,105
(thunder rumbling)

1052
01:14:33,243 --> 01:14:36,160
(mysterious music)

1053
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:43,698
That's Jim's bike.

1054
01:14:43,698 --> 01:14:45,634
(Linda screaming)

1055
01:14:45,634 --> 01:14:48,134
(scary music)

1056
01:14:51,415 --> 01:14:54,332
(mysterious music)

1057
01:14:58,345 --> 01:15:01,870
- Poor Mr. Jack, you can't be saved.

1058
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:02,750
- Vivian, please.

1059
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:04,233
- No, no, let her finish.

1060
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:08,553
- It's like you were in a shallow grave.

1061
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:11,930
I know where they're going.

1062
01:15:14,019 --> 01:15:17,019
(adventurous music)

1063
01:15:32,868 --> 01:15:34,308
- These are ash.

1064
01:15:34,308 --> 01:15:35,953
- Get the hammer.

1065
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:39,536
(tense, frightening music)

1066
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:53,411
(deep, scary music)
(bell tolling)

1067
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:14,667
(adventurous music)

1068
01:16:24,994 --> 01:16:25,994
- Please no.

1069
01:16:27,018 --> 01:16:30,018
(adventurous music)

1070
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:38,372
- Let's go.

1071
01:16:38,372 --> 01:16:40,181
(adventurous music)

1072
01:16:40,181 --> 01:16:41,459
- No.

1073
01:16:41,459 --> 01:16:44,286
(adventurous music)

1074
01:16:44,286 --> 01:16:46,426
(scythe clanking)

1075
01:16:46,426 --> 01:16:50,009
(tense, suspenseful music)

1076
01:17:32,627 --> 01:17:34,373
- You know me, don't you?

1077
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:38,549
(mysterious music)

1078
01:17:42,065 --> 01:17:46,020
I'm the last of the ones who
brought you into this world.

1079
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:49,193
Now go, back to hell.

1080
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:56,150

(adventurous music)

1102
01:19:23,183 --> 01:19:25,958

(adventurous music)

1104
01:19:48,669 --> 01:19:53,243

But there is somethin' you can do.

Say a prayer for your
daddy tonight, you hear me?

Carolyn.

The one the kids call the Pumpkin Man.

1133
01:22:49,844 --> 01:22:50,677
- Sean.

1134
01:22:50,677 --> 01:22:51,701
- Sean?

1135
01:22:51,701 --> 01:22:53,801

Come on.

or treating next year?

1142
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,734
- Not if you don't want to, honey.

1143

(gentle, somber music)

1144
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:44,170
- [David] Let's go get
some breakfast, I'm buyin'.

1145
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:46,350
- [Carolyn] I guess I need a sugar fix.

1146
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:50,133
I'd like a big slice of pie,

1147
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:53,983
with a scoop of vanilla
ice cream on the side.

1148
01:23:53,983 --> 01:23:55,490

1149
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:58,827
