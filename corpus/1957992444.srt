00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,231
Are you going to
write any of this?

3
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:40,967
I wrote plenty.

4
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:42,068
Plenty?

5
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,102
You wrote act one.

6
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,203
Well, there you are then.

7
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,272
I don't mean you wrote act one.

8
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,041
I mean, you wrote
the words "Act I"

9
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:50,843
at the top of the first page.

10
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,511
I'm thinking.

11
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,880
Well, what is it
you're thinking?

12
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,281
Do you know that you're
never more than six feet away

13
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,116
from a spider?

14
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,184
Sure.

15
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,987
It goes like this.

16
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:01,921
(SINGING) You're never
more than six feet away

17
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:03,823
from a spider, baby.

18
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:08,360
So you better stay
away from my fly.

19
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,729
That makes no sense.

20
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:10,997
I liked it.

21
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:12,330
Well, put it in some other play.

22
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:12,965
It was your idea.

23
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,834
No.

24
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:16,502
My idea was that no
matter how secure

25
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:19,237
you are, how safe you
feel, danger could

26
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,606
be right at your shoulder.

27
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:21,974
Ah, the spider is a metaphor.

28
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,576
Or a simile.

29
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:24,242
I can never remember
the difference.

30
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,946
Me neither.

31
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:27,079
But whichever it is, it's an
important theme for our play,

32
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:27,713
isn't it?

33
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:28,246
It is?

34
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,015
Well, yeah.

35
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:31,182
Think of it.

36
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,485
We have Bridgette, a
beautiful young woman in love,

37
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,821
probably for the first
time in her life,

38
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,858
with Richard, about whom she
knows absolutely nothing.

39
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,926
I mean, he could
be an axe murderer.

40
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,062
But he isn't.

41
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:44,096
Maybe he should be.

42
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,032
An axe murderer?

43
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:48,100
No, but a spider.

00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:51,671
[dark chuckle]

45
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:54,205
I mean, maybe axe
murderer is a bit much.

46
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:58,476
But he should have, like, a
dark side, a dangerous side.

47
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,780
Well, I think he already does.

48
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:04,215
Well, let's see
what we have on him.

49
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,652
"Richard enters.

He is a pleasant-looking

Cricket, anyone?

54
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,335
Wait.

55
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,938
He's playing cricket?

56
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,305
Why is he playing cricket?

57
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,174
Who plays cricket?

58
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:29,474
He's British.

59
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,342
Why is he British?

60
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,912
Why does it matter?

61
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:35,581
Well, not scary, for one.

62
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,084
I mean, the scariest thing about
the British is their teeth.

63
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:39,719
You know, they started taking
better care of their teeth

64
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,021
after the Austin Powers movies.

65
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:42,922
Yeah, you're right.

66
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:44,857
It's weird.

67
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:45,457
OK.

He's wearing tennis clothes
and carries a racket."

73
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:54,569
Tennis, anyone?

74
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,581
Gee, I'm shaking in my boots.

75
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,915
He does seem kind of bland.

76
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,751
Yeah.

77
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:13,451
But remember, this
is the first time

78
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,788
we're seeing him before the
main action of the play.

79
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,859
And his line is an old cliche
meant to evoke titters.

80
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:24,329
I hope no line I ever
write evokes titters.

81
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,064
So what then?

82
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:26,232
OK, OK.

83
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:26,601

He's dressed in tennis clothes
and holding a tennis racket.

dripping with blood.

that's going to happen later.

We haven't written
what happens later.

94

But even still, it gives
everything we've written so far

95
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:07,139
kind of foreshadowing.

going to happen.

Aren't they a bit old to
be your aunt and uncle?

Great aunt and uncle actually.

Why?

Well, I was on the tennis court.

00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,598
And I walked across the lawn.

134
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,368
I saw the gate in the
fence and came over.

I'm sorry if-- I
didn't mean to--

No, no.

It's quite all right.

I used that gate all the
time when I was a girl.

milk and cookies with Nancy

that's all.

I was much younger.

remember seeing you.

was away at school.

Thank you.

I could use some cold water.

from hitting all those balls.

Not-- I just-- lemonade.

I get excited over lemonade.

That's-- I'm sorry.

181
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,554
Yay, lemonade.

183
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:44,992
OK then.

184
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,806
What are you doing?

185
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:01,673
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

186
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,876
I'm sorry.

187
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:08,914
I just-- I like to measure
things, everything.

188
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,617
Did you know that your door
here is exactly 42 inches wide?

189
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,086
Exactly.

190
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:17,222
No, I didn't.

191
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,758
Why exactly do you
measure everything?

192
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,028
Is it some sort of OCD?

193
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,530
[laughter]

194
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:24,963
Yes.

195
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,599
Yes.

196
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:32,505
I absolutely have to know how
long and wide everything is.

197
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:36,275
And I can't stop
washing my hands.

198
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:37,709
That's fascinating.

199
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,012
It is.

200
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,781
I have a friend who won't
walk on tile floors.

201
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,216
What a loon.

202
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:47,188
[clapping]

203
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:49,190
Thank you.

204
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:55,663
[sigh]

205
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,732
Well, I hope you
enjoy the lemonade.

206
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:05,671
It's completely
homemade, or at least

207
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:06,605
that's what it
says on the bottle.

208
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,840
[laughter]

209
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:12,111
Oh, I'm sure that I will.

210
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:17,182
However, there's a little
something I have to do first.

211
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:20,252
[gasps]

212
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:23,257
[choking]

213
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,394
Wait a minute.

214
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,963
Isn't it a little
early in the play

215
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,232
to show that Richard's
a psycho killer?

216
00:10:33,234 --> 00:10:34,501
And we haven't
even really decided

217
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:35,968
that he is a psycho killer.

218
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,003
No, he's a psycho
killer all right.

219
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,872
But maybe you're right.

220
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,440
Maybe we should hold
back on the violence

221
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:43,308
and let the tension build.

222
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,577
If this was a movie--

223
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:45,612
That's the thing.

224
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:47,479
Why isn't it a movie?

225
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,981
Why are we even writing a play?

226
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,316
This is Los Angeles.

227
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,085
Because it's a play.

228
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:55,387
But it doesn't have to be.

229
00:10:55,389 --> 00:11:00,659
Look, why spend the next few
weeks, possibly months, writing

230
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:05,598
a play that'll be put up at some
tiny little black box theater

231
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,866
and be seen by maybe
a dozen people,

232
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,169
because they know
somebody in the cast?

233
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,304
I mean, it'll just be some
other fucking play in LA.

234
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:14,873
We'll be lucky if we
get even one review.

235
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,242
Nobody cares about
theater in La La Land.

236
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,579
At least in the theater
nobody can tell us what to do.

237
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:22,014
The writer has power.

238
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,183
No studio executive who's
taken Robert McKee's course

239
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:26,185
and now thinks he knows
everything there is to know

240
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:28,754
about writing can
tell us what to write.

241
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,523
But you can't make a
living as a playwright.

242
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:32,991
There are thousands of
successful playwrights.

243
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:36,061
In the film business,
you can be a lousy writer

244
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,197
and still make a fortune.

245
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,832
There's just as little
chance of success, even less.

246
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,034
Most movie scripts just
end up taking space

247
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,269
on your hard drive.

248
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,205
At least we have a chance
of someone seeing our play

249
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:48,340
and nobody can fuck us over.

250
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:50,943
Not everybody in the film
business gets fucked.

251
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:53,078
And we can negotiate
for some real money.

252
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,480
One thing I know is true,
in the film industry,

253
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,015
you will get fucked.

254
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,685
The only thing you're
ever negotiating

255
00:11:58,687 --> 00:11:59,851
is the amount of the lubricant.

256
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:00,452
All right.

257
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:01,119
All right.

258
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:01,453
Fine.

259
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:02,655
Fine.

260
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:04,856
It's a play, for now.

261
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:05,791
But there's something
I got to change.

262
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:06,659
What?

263
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:07,859
Richard.

264
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,363
His name, it's too normal.

265
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:12,264
Don't we want him
to seem normal?

266
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,932
No.

267
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,435
I think he should
be exceptional.

268
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:20,138
And I think he's exceptionally
good-looking, exceptionally

269
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,108
charming, and he should have
an exceptional-sounding name.

270
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,644
What do you have
in mind, Aloysius?

271
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:26,411
OK, not that exceptional.

272
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:31,216
But it could be
something upper crusty,

273
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,686
like one of those first names
that can also be a last name.

274
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:38,090
I went to school with a very
WASP-y kid named Cooper.

275
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,224
Cooper?

276
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,959
Cooper.

277
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,895
Cooper Babcock.

278
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:44,597
I like it.

279
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,531
It's--

280
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:46,331
Upper crusty?

281
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,165
Upper crusty.

282
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,868
Cooper Babcock it is.

283
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,971
Search and replace and done.

284
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,474
Maybe it's too upper crusty.

285
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:56,643
No, it's fine.

286
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:59,111
Let's move on.

287
00:12:59,113 --> 00:12:59,878
Now, what are we doing
about this strangling scene?

288
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,213
OK.

289
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,481
So we know that Richard--

290
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:03,882
Cooper.

291
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,985
--Cooper wants the Picasso.

292
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:10,389
But what if all he
wants is the Picasso?

293
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:14,594
Like we know he's a thief and
the audience can know that.

294
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:17,329
But we don't know that
he's a psycho killer,

295
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:18,765
because we haven't
decided whether or not

296
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:20,132
he's the psycho killer.

297
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,266
What do we have so far?

298
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,802
All right.

299
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:24,604
We introduce Richard--

300
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:25,772
Cooper.

301
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:27,906
--Cooper Babcock.

302
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:31,410
And we see that he
has done something

303
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:34,146
bloody with the tennis racket,
but we don't know what.

304
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:37,883
We also don't know what he's
done with Nancy and David,

305
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:41,119
or if he's even
related to them at all.

306
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,657
But we do know that he is
interested in the Picasso

307
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,358
and he's not at all
interested in Bridgette.

308
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,826
Aha.

309
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:48,594
That's what we have to change.

310
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,495
What?

311
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,030
That he isn't
interested in Bridgette.

312
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,432
What if he has plans
to take the Picasso,

313
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:54,734
but he's so taken
with Bridgette that it

314
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:55,400
puts a crimp in his plan?

315
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,569
Hmm.

316
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:58,571
That could work.

317
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:00,540
But something's bothered me.

318
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,775
I don't think we should show
the bloody tennis racket.

319
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:04,176
No, but it's great.

320
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,779
That's a terrific,
horrific image.

321
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,480
Yeah, but it gives
away too much.

322
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:10,916
I mean, the audience
should feel some sympathy

323
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,417
for Cooper, at
least a little bit.

324
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,485
At first.

325
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:14,721
But later on--

326
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:15,921
Later on is something else.

327
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,757
Let's see where this takes us.

328
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,191
I've got an idea.

329
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,327
But in order for
it to work, Cooper

330
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,664
has to be much younger,
like Bridgette's age.

331
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,267
[eerie music]

332
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,643
So how are you enjoying
staying with David and Nancy?

333
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:38,778
Oh, they're no trouble.

334
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,879
No trouble at all.

335
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,615
And how are you
getting on with Milo?

336
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:43,482
Milo?

337
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:45,618
Yes.

338
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,554
Don't you find him
extraordinarily intelligent?

339
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:50,857
Yes, of course.

340
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:54,226
We've had many
long conversations.

341
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,928
He has a very interesting
perspective on life.

342
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,497
[chuckling]

343
00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:59,599
You're funny.

344
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:02,067
Am I?

345
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,002
You've had many long
conversations with a dog?

346
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,571
[suspenseful music]

347
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:08,073
Well, they were
rather one-sided.

348
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,442
I could barely get
a word in edgewise.

349
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:13,178
[chuckling]

350
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,414
You are funny.

351
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,216
So where do you
usually stay when

352
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,752
you're not staying next door?

353
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:21,286
I was in prison.

354
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:21,721
Prison?

355
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:22,688
Prison?

356
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,589
No.

357
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:25,023
Yes.

358
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:29,428
At least it felt that way.

359
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,330
So I decided to take
a little time off.

360
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:33,965
Mhm.

361
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,935
For good behavior?

362
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,572
Something like that.

363
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:42,307
So what do you do?

364
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:47,279
Well, I was at Bryn Mawr,
graduated with highest honors.

365
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:51,316
And I'm now, like most
people, unemployed.

366
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,753
Thank God I am filthy rich.

367
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:57,690
[laughing]

368
00:15:57,692 --> 00:16:03,128
Well, it does take a bit of
the pressure off, doesn't it?

369
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,897
Unfortunately, my
parents' trust fund

370
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,833
doesn't kick in until I'm 30.

371
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:08,601
That is ghastly.

372
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:12,638
Ghastly indeed.

373
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,043
So till then, I'll just have
to survive however I can.

374
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,513
Maybe tennis.

375
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:20,582
Are you good?

376
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,222
Well, I usually hit
what I'm supposed to.

377
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:31,158
How's your serve?

378
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:37,630
Hardly ever returned.

379
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,231
Really?

380
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:40,535
Then, you are good.

381
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:44,604
[door opens]

382
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:45,003
[record scratch]

383
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:48,141
[clucking]

384
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,211
Wait a second.

385
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,379
What the fuck is that?

386
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,515
Someone in a chicken costume.

387
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,550
Yeah.

388
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:58,651
I can see it's someone
in a chicken costume.

389
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:00,520
Why is it someone in
a chicken costume?

390
00:17:00,522 --> 00:17:02,020
I thought it would
be cool to introduce

391
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,155
a surreal element to the play.

392
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,691
You see, this is why
I like the movies,

393
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:08,493
because nobody just shows
up in a chicken costume.

394
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,996
That's the beauty of theater.

395
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:11,731
There are no rules.

396
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:13,599
If you want someone
in a chicken costume,

397
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,902
you can have someone
in a chicken costume.

398
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:17,937
Well, I don't want someone
in a chicken costume.

399
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,772
What do you got against
someone in a chicken costume?

400
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:20,740
It makes no sense.

401
00:17:20,742 --> 00:17:22,942
What if it made sense?

402
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:25,043
How is it going to make sense?

403
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,045
Watch and learn.

404
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,651
[clucking]

405
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:34,020
Huh.

406
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:36,321
Where is everybody?

407
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,891
The costume party is
tomorrow night, Blain.

408
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:40,091
No, no, no, no, no, no.

409
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,561
That can't be right.

410
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:43,729
Today is Friday the
16th, is it not?

411
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:46,966
It's Friday all right,
but it's the 15th.

412
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:50,235
But he's in costume.

413
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:50,738
Those are tennis clothes.

414
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,712
So they are.

415
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:02,582
My apologies.

416
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:04,550
We were just having
some lemonade.

417
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:07,053
Ah.

418
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:10,523
I think I could use something
a little bit stronger.

419
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:12,959
So could I, come to think of it.

420
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,225
Cooper?

421
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,161
I'm good with this.

422
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:18,163
Blaine, this is Cooper.

423
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,098
He's staying with the Babcocks.

424
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,935
Really?

425
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:25,871
My house is just abreast the
starboard side of their house.

426
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:27,339
I haven't seen you.

427
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:28,941
How long have you been there?

428
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:32,210
Just a few days.

429
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:35,881
Cooper says he
talks to their dog.

430
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:39,919
In all fairness, we are
speaking to a chicken.

431
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,087
So we are.

432
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:42,088
How silly.

433
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,889
[chuckling]

434
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:46,592
Well, cheers.

435
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:49,629
The chicken costume was
a last-minute decision.

436
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:52,497
I was going to go
as Freddy Krueger.

437
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:56,602
But I've gone as old Freddy
for every costume party

438
00:18:56,604 --> 00:18:58,438
and Halloween outing
since I was nine.

439
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:05,011
Well, it's a very
good chicken costume.

440
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:06,045
And it suits you.

441
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:07,479
Mhm.

442
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,281
It does, sort of.

443
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:13,052
How so, would you say?

444
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:17,155
Well, you see, I've got a
dreadful heart condition.

445
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,960
Any severe shock and I
could drop dead right here.

446
00:19:20,962 --> 00:19:23,596
So naturally, I'm timid
of things like horror

447
00:19:23,598 --> 00:19:27,500
films and violence, you know.

448
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:30,670
But you dressed
like Freddy Krueger.

449
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:34,140
Well, if I dress
like the scary thing,

450
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:35,240
I'm not likely to get scared.

451
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,108
Now, am I?

452
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,010
[laughing]

453
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:41,947
Very clever.

454
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:45,551
Look, I have all the stuff set
up in the kitchen for tomorrow.

455
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:48,353
Shall I be naughty and
get us some snacks?

456
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,957
Caviar, champagne, cocaine?

457
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,526
Why don't you just ring for it?

458
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:55,628
The staff has the night off.

459
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,496
Oh my God.

460
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,465
You have to actually
get things for yourself?

461
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,967
However will you survive?

462
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,803
Very funny.

463
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:03,938
I'll be right back.

464
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:13,946
Oh, Blain, you and Cooper
should get along famously.

465
00:20:13,948 --> 00:20:16,115
He was admiring my
father's Picasso before.

466
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:16,617
Was he?

467
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:26,491
Admiring daddy's
Picasso were we?

468
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:30,395
What the fuck are
you doing here?

469
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,731
What the fuck are
you doing here?

470
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:34,867
I'm introducing a plot twist.

471
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:37,069
So you're saying Blain and
Cooper know each other?

472
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:40,039
Not only know each other,
but they're in cahoots.

473
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,372
Cahoots?

474
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,209
Who are you, Buffalo Bill?

475
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:44,242
It's a perfectly good word.

476
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,310
[crash]

477
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,513
Yes.

478
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:48,948
This is where we
reveal that something

479
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,151
is going on that the
audience didn't realize.

480
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:54,252
There's something going
on that I didn't realize.

481
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:55,521
Don't worry.

482
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:56,055
I've got it all worked out.

483
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:58,826
[gasping]

484
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:02,194
What the fuck are
you doing here?

485
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,563
Imagine my surprise
when I come here

486
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,198
and see you sitting
there a day early.

487
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,066
It's not part of the plan.

488
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:08,734
I improvised.

489
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:09,935
Why leave a house
full of witnesses?

490
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:13,205
Drunk witnesses at
a costume party.

491
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:15,406
I could've taken the painting
from right under their noses.

492
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,341
No one would've identified you.

493
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:17,308
Except you.

494
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,476
You can trust me.

495
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,645
You're in a chicken suit.

496
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:21,914
Look, it's going to work.

497
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,884
We take the painting tonight,
take care of Bridgette.

498
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:28,154
Then, tomorrow--
listen. --as the guests

499
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:31,389
arrive, we among them,
walk in to discover

500
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:35,127
a horrible bloody scene.

501
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:36,061
But--

502
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:37,963
Bloody scene?

503
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,464
Does it-- does it have
to be a bloody scene?

504
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,667
Doesn't have to
be, but I really,

505
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:44,770
really, really want it to be.

506
00:21:44,772 --> 00:21:47,940
You're a sick fuck, Blain.

507
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:51,243
Hey, you were down
with the plan before.

508
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:54,046
Remember robbery, murder,
something Manson-esque?

509
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,182
[snarl]

510
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:56,782
That was before.

511
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:57,382
[romantic music]

512
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:58,686
Before what?

513
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:04,890
Before I met her.

514
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:07,660
I like her.

515
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:12,097
She's a real person.

516
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:15,034
She's a stuck-up real bitch
who deserves everything

517
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:16,334
that's coming to her.

518
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,069
Who's that?

519
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:21,372
Oh, no.

520
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,909
Just this chick
from the club, walks

521
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:25,511
around acting like
a princess just

522
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:28,781
because her parents are rich.

523
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:31,217
I utterly loathe
people like that.

524
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:32,751
[giggling]

525
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:34,019
OK.

526
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,722
Dig in.

527
00:22:36,724 --> 00:22:41,392
There's caviar,
Scottish salmon, blinis,

528
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,696
and grapes from my
father's vineyard, food

529
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:44,897
for the common folk.

530
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:46,497
[laughter]

531
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,299
Common folk.

532
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:48,667
Poors.

533
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:52,638
Those poor people.

534
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,741
I saw you admiring my
father's Picasso before.

535
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:59,778
It's his pride and joy.

536
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,615
I thought you were
his pride and joy.

537
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:04,917
Don't make me laugh.

538
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,354
He couldn't auction me
off for $50 million.

539
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:10,556
It'll be OK.

540
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:11,389
Wrong pipe.

541
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,758
Wrong pipe.

542
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,626
You'll be all right.

543
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:14,293
Won't you, buddy?

544
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:15,527
Yes.

545
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,795
$50 million you say?

546
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:18,964
Yes.

547
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,666
He had an offer for that
for some art dealer.

548
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:23,669
But dad turned him down.

549
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:27,873
Now, if the father of some
boy from a good family

550
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:32,011
offered that for me, well, he'd
sell in the blink of an eye.

551
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:33,545
Oh, that's absurd.

552
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:35,314
People don't sell people.

553
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:37,216
Don't they?

554
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:39,685
I mean, after all,
it's the ruling class'

555
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:41,720
most popular commodity.

556
00:23:41,722 --> 00:23:43,622
They sell each other
their children,

557
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:46,659
sell each other to the country.

558
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:48,928
It's called American politics.

559
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,063
Yes.

560
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:55,668
Well, aren't you
philosophical for a chicken?

561
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,271
I thought of having
someone steal the Picasso.

562
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,707
[coughing]

563
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:07,012
As you were saying,
steal the Picasso?

564
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:10,582
Yes, just to spite my father
and, of course, for the money.

565
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,450
You need money?

566
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,852
Absolutely.

567
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:17,589
None of this is mine.

568
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:20,392
I don't even really
live here anymore.

569
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:22,661
My parents are at their
house on Martha's Vineyard

570
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:25,397
and I'm crashing here.

571
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,967
If they knew I was here,
well, they'd call the cops.

572
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,702
Why is that?

573
00:24:29,704 --> 00:24:33,706
Because I'm a bad, bad girl.

574
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,341
Didn't you know?

575
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:36,644
I don't believe I did.

576
00:24:40,948 --> 00:24:42,482
Bad how?

577
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:49,588
Where have you been all my life?

578
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,226
[barking]

579
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:57,963
OK.

580
00:24:57,965 --> 00:24:59,698
She's the worst type of bad.

581
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,001
One, she slept with a Mexican.

582
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:05,137
Two, she's tattooed and pierced
and voted for Barack Hussein

583
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:06,672
Obama.

584
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:08,540
He wasn't Mexican.

585
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,509
He was from Ecuador.

586
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:11,810
A Mexican.

587
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:14,980
Anyway, far worse than that.

588
00:25:14,982 --> 00:25:18,884
I also used my father's
electronic setup

589
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:21,920
to eavesdrop on the two of you
while I was getting snacks.

590
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:24,089
OK.

591
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:28,360
So you'd like to
murder me, Blain,

592
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,195
in a particularly bloody way?

593
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:30,763
I would never.

594
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:31,597
It's a joke.

595
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,064
It's a joke.

596
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:32,664
Never.

597
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,432
[gunshot]

598
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:34,366
Oh, fuck.

599
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:35,134
Oh.

600
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:36,402
Oh, fuck.

601
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:38,604
The fucking bitch shot me.

602
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:40,205
Bridgette.

603
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:40,739
Bridgette.

604
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:42,074
[scoffing]

605
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,208
Stop.

606
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,011
You help me right now.

607
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:49,648
I could probably make it.

608
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,252
We could go to Cedars
or St. Joseph's.

609
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:55,522
Oh, please.

610
00:25:55,524 --> 00:25:56,588
Please, help me.

611
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,057
Please.

612
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:58,757
Are you going to shoot me too?

613
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,992
Oh, it hurts--

614
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:01,593
I haven't decided that yet.

615
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:03,295
Depends.

616
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:04,229
Please, brother.

617
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:05,197
Help me, please.

618
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,131
Please?

619
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:07,332
On what?

620
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:09,034
My feathers are bloody.

621
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:10,903
Oh, please.

622
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:12,505
Did you mean it when
you said you liked me?

623
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:13,439
Help me.

624
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:14,706
Please.

625
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:15,207
[romantic piano music]

626
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:17,609
Yes.

627
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:22,147
Yes, I did, very much so.

628
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:24,650
There's a light.

629
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:26,952
Oh, looks like one of those
lights outside of a barbershop.

630
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:28,220
What?

631
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:29,321
Please.

632
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:31,123
Oh, Jesus, Lord.

633
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,357
Oh.

634
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:35,194
Even right now.

635
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:38,097
I think I see Gram Gram.

636
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,065
I smell the cinnamon
buns she made.

637
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:41,033
Please.

638
00:26:41,035 --> 00:26:42,301
Oh.

639
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:43,135
That's not grandma.

640
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:43,669
That's Satan.

641
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:45,304
Oh, please.

642
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:46,573
Oh, goodness.

643
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:48,807
You're making this very awkward.

644
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,410
I made you a fucking
friendship bracelet.

645
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:53,580
Shut up about the bracelet.

646
00:26:53,582 --> 00:26:55,948
I'm very happy for you both,
but I'm fucking dying here.

647
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,715
Please.

648
00:26:56,717 --> 00:26:58,150
Not fast enough.

649
00:26:58,152 --> 00:26:58,585
[gunshot]

650
00:26:58,587 --> 00:26:59,151
Fuck.

651
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:00,752
Oh.

652
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:02,555
Shot again.

653
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:04,892
[cluck]

654
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,328
Was that second shot
really necessary?

655
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,396
I think it was.

656
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:14,833
Well, he was a racist chicken.

657
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:16,802
What happens now?

658
00:27:16,804 --> 00:27:18,003
[mysterious music]

659
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:18,272
I haven't figured that out yet.

660
00:27:21,942 --> 00:27:24,409
So what happens now?

661
00:27:24,411 --> 00:27:25,878
I haven't figured that out yet.

662
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,780
Look, I'm not sure
about any of this.

663
00:27:28,782 --> 00:27:30,282
So we're saying Bridgette is
the psycho killer, not Cooper?

664
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:31,717
Yes.

665
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,784
And she's the one with the plan.

666
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:34,853
What's the plan?

667
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:36,589
To steal her father's
Picasso and blame it

668
00:27:36,591 --> 00:27:38,790
on Blain and another accomplice.

669
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:41,160
You know, I actually like this.

670
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:44,363
It's getting very classical
stage mystery/comedy.

671
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:46,498
You know, like Deathtrap
or The Mousetrap.

672
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,299
You're right.

673
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:48,734
It is.

674
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:50,736
Oh, fuck.

675
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:52,938
We should change everything.

676
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,642
We should go back and make
it less like those plays

677
00:27:55,644 --> 00:27:57,342
and make it more movie-like.

678
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,311
There you go with that
movie thing again.

679
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:01,413
You do know that The Mousetrap
is the most successful, longest

680
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:03,115
running play in history?

681
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:05,784
And Deathtrap ran
forever and they even

682
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:08,487
made a movie out of it with
Michael Caine and Superman.

683
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:11,089
Christopher Reeve.

684
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:11,624
If we can write a play even
half as successful as those two,

685
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:12,391
we'll have a hit.

686
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:14,661
Think of it.

687
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:16,828
Small cast, one set, thrills
and chills and comedy.

688
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,197
Nobody's writing plays
like this anymore.

689
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,398
Yeah, because they're old hat.

690
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
No, they're not.

691
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:22,901
If you can write a good
play in that genre,

692
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:25,737
you can get it produced
and make a lot of money.

693
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:27,674
Community theaters
love that kind of shit.

694
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:31,611
What happened to the idea of
a surrealistic, avant garde,

695
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:33,812
mind-bending neo-noir thriller?

696
00:28:33,814 --> 00:28:36,683
Have you ever noticed that
the avant garde never changes?

697
00:28:36,685 --> 00:28:37,749
If it's after garde,
when was garde?

698
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:38,817
I must've missed it.

699
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:39,619
That would be apres garde.

700
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:40,653
What would be?

701
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:43,789
Our play, Murdertrap.

702
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:44,356
Murdertrap?

703
00:28:44,358 --> 00:28:45,692
Yes.

704
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:46,959
I just came up with it.

705
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:49,761
Cool title, huh?

706
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:52,364
Isn't it a little much like
Deathtrap or The Mousetrap?

707
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:54,066
Only in the "trap" part.

708
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,801
Besides it makes a
great movie title.

00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:57,236

00:28:57,238 --> 00:28:58,237
Someday.

711
00:28:58,239 --> 00:28:59,071
All right.

712
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:00,839
You've convinced me.

Broadway success.

One thing though.

Don't these characters
seem British?

Why do you say that?

717
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:12,084
Well, I don't know
anyone like these people.

00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:13,151
Do you any British
people like these people?

00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:15,821
No.

720
00:29:15,823 --> 00:29:18,323
But I think that it would be
classier if they were British.

721
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:19,791
OK.

722
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:20,560

no one saw me.

00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:55,528
So what do we do about Blain?

733
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,030
Just leave him there
behind the couch.

Remember, we caught
him in the midst

735
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:04,803
of committing grand larceny
and justifiably shot him.

736
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,305
Mhm.

737
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:08,741
Twice.

738
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:10,275
The gun has a hair trigger.

739
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:12,411
[sigh]

740
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:15,314
I think you should say we
were being held captive.

741
00:30:15,316 --> 00:30:19,351
There was a struggle and the
gun went off quite accidentally.

742
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:21,721
Twice?

743
00:30:21,723 --> 00:30:23,021
Could be hard to explain.

744
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:24,724
Not really.

745
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:27,694
You were fighting for your life.

746
00:30:27,696 --> 00:30:29,861
I was fighting for my life?

747
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:31,597
Well, the police
will never believe

748
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,099
that I could've disarmed him.

749
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:36,769
Yes.

750
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:39,739
You're quite right.

751
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:40,606
We'll have to say I shot him.

752
00:30:40,608 --> 00:30:44,744
Oh, well.

753
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:50,415
Now, how exactly do we
explain the chicken suit?

754
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:51,617
That's easy.

755
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,285
We'll tell the truth.

756
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:55,755
Blain mistook the
date and thought

757
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:58,457
he was going to be
attending a costume party.

758
00:30:58,459 --> 00:30:58,758
All right.

759
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,926
Yeah.

760
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:02,894
Well, how do we explain me?

761
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:06,164
You're my neighbor.

762
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:12,270
Bridgette, I'm not
really your neighbor.

763
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:15,808
But you're David
and Nancy's nephew.

764
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,110
Unfortunately, not.

765
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:20,747
Great nephew?

766
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:23,281
Not even remotely related.

767
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:25,651
But you are staying
with them, aren't you?

768
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:27,986
In a manner of speaking, yes.

769
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:31,323
Whatever do you mean?

770
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:33,091
I'm afraid I slit
both their throats

771
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,527
and buried them in
the rose garden.

772
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:34,893
Oopsie daisy.

773
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:36,928
And Milo?

774
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,965
Milo is just fine.

775
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:43,870
What the bloody hell
do you take me for?

776
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:48,940
Possibly my soulmate.

777
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:51,309
[romantic music]

778
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:53,513
Oh, I was hoping
you felt that way.

779
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:55,080
I felt an immediate attraction
towards you the moment

780
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:57,349
I first laid eyes on you.

781
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:58,518
And it's only deepened
massively in the brief time

782
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,820
I've known you.

783
00:32:00,822 --> 00:32:04,456
You are a complete sociopath
without one single redeeming

784
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,124
quality.

785
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:08,828
I'm afraid that's entirely true.

786
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,730
Kiss me.

787
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:14,099
Oh, it still hurts.

788
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:16,001
Oh, it's not happened yet.

789
00:32:16,003 --> 00:32:16,935
I think I did shit--

790
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:20,140
[farting]

791
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:23,576
[scream]

792
00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:25,545
Please.

793
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:28,246
I made you that fucking
friendship bracelet.

794
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:30,650
I gave you my last
Livestrong bracelet.

795
00:32:30,652 --> 00:32:32,785
Hold on a tick.

796
00:32:32,787 --> 00:32:33,853
Help me, please.

797
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:35,020
Please.

798
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:36,889
We can stop for fro-yo.

799
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:37,790
I know you love Menchies.

800
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:38,825
[ominous music]

801
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:43,529
Why don't you just die?

802
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:46,066
[squelching]

803
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:04,251
Murder, anyone?

804
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:13,325
So now, we have two psycho
killers in the scene.

805
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:15,026
Three if you count, Blain.

806
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:15,994
Isn't that a bit much?

807
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,095
No, no, no.

808
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:19,364
The more, the merrier.

809
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:20,999
You can never have too many
psycho killers, Clarice.

810
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:23,235
OK.

811
00:33:23,237 --> 00:33:24,002
But it's getting a
little far-fetched.

812
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,505
Well, isn't that the point?

813
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:28,641
Isn't art supposed
to be far-fetched?

814
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:31,577
You don't plop down a hundred or
even $12.50 to go see something

815
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:33,513
that's fetched.

816
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:34,680
I don't think that's
an actual term.

817
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,114
Why not?

818
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:38,250
Why are things only far-fetched?

819
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:39,919
Why can't they be
merely-fetched or 3/4-fetched?

820
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:41,754
I don't know.

821
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:43,689
The point is, where
do we go from here?

822
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:44,957
We've already thrown
out the whole outline.

823
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,191
You know what?

824
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:47,727
I think that's a good thing.

825
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:49,394
Let's take this thing
as far as we can.

826
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:51,964
And I am not wild about
them being British.

827
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:53,198
OK.

828
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,700
So make them American.

829
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:56,869
I'll go back and
change lorry to truck

830
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:58,704
and make the other things in
that scene more American later.

831
00:33:58,706 --> 00:33:59,104
All right.

832
00:33:59,106 --> 00:33:59,872
All right.

833
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:00,506
All right.

834
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:02,542
Great.

835
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:02,909
Because I have an idea
for what happens next.

836
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:03,809
Carry on, old chap.

837
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:05,210
I said not British.

838
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:06,077
I just wanted to
get that out there

839
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,113
before we go all colonial again.

840
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:09,615
All right.

841
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:11,784
It's later now.

842
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:14,020
Cooper, I'm worried someone's
going to find the body

843
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:15,353
and ruin everything.

844
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:17,557
Don't even worry about it.

845
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:20,091
Blain fit right in the grave
next to David and Nancy.

846
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:24,329
And he's now perfectly covered
by David's prizewinning roses.

847
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:26,866
Blain's disappearance won't
be noticed for a while.

848
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:29,367
He often disappears for months
at a time and only returns

849
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:31,771
when he runs out of money.

850
00:34:31,773 --> 00:34:36,074
But how ever are we going
to explain David and Nancy?

851
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,544
What?

852
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:39,477
Why do we need to explain
anything about them?

853
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:42,080
What do they have to do with us?

854
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,583
You're right.

855
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:45,918
I hadn't thought
of it like that.

856
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,020
We're in the clear.

857
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:49,855
Nothing can stop us now.

858
00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:51,189
[knocking]

859
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:52,257
Hello?

860
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:53,993
Anybody home?

861
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:55,695
Who can that be?

862
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:56,361
I don't know.

863
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:57,128
It sounds like a woman.

864
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,631
[knocking]

865
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:01,299
Hello?

866
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:02,535
Her voice doesn't
sound familiar.

867
00:35:02,537 --> 00:35:04,804
I don't want to let her in.

868
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:07,272
I think you have to.

869
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:07,675
You can't do
anything suspicious.

870
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:20,318
Hello.

871
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,887
Sup, bitches?

872
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:22,955
I'm Mary Clemens.

873
00:35:22,957 --> 00:35:24,090
I'm a psychic.

874
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:24,424
I live next door.

875
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:29,260
Wait, wait, wait.

876
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:31,229
We can't have a
psychic next door.

877
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:32,598
That's right out of Deathtrap.

878
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,199
Well, cheese and crackers.

879
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:35,333
I'll make it different.

880
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:37,235
Yeah, it got all muddy.

881
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:38,971
I am Mary Clemens.

882
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:40,840
I am blind.

883
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:43,843
[clattering]

884
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:44,977
Who's there?

885
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:46,646
A blind woman?

886
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:48,179
We can't have a blind woman.

887
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:49,949
That's out of Wait Until Dark.

888
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:51,249
We can't rip off two
successful plays like that.

889
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:51,984
It's not a rip off.

890
00:35:51,986 --> 00:35:53,318
It's an homage.

891
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,152
An homage?

892
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:56,354
Yes.

893
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:58,591
And besides, Deathtrap
had a psychic.

894
00:35:58,593 --> 00:36:00,626
And Wait Until Dark
had a blind woman.

895
00:36:00,628 --> 00:36:02,795
But neither of those
had a blind psychic.

896
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:03,395
OK.

897
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:05,698
It's an homage.

898
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,799
But let's make her
French and not a psychic.

899
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:08,134
All right.

900
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:10,335
I am Marie Clement de la France.

901
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:13,105
I am blind and I am a medium.

902
00:36:13,107 --> 00:36:14,874
A medium?

903
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:17,143
You mean a psychic,
like in Deathtrap?

904
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:19,277
(AMERICAN ACCENT) No, not
at all like that play.

905
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:21,446
No.

906
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:22,347
I cannot read mind
or see the future.

907
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,282
See, guys?

908
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:25,084
Shit ain't nothing
like Deathtrap.

909
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:28,253
But I can tell the past.

910
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:31,590
Also not like The Dead Zone.

911
00:36:31,592 --> 00:36:33,425
Won't you sit down, Ms. Clement?

912
00:36:33,427 --> 00:36:35,528
Merci beaucoup.

913
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,829
Oh, um.

914
00:36:36,831 --> 00:36:38,229
It's just to your right.

915
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:38,998
Oh, no.

916
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,298
Sorry.

917
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:40,231
Can you help her, please?

918
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:41,000
Mhm.

919
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:41,934
Here.

920
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:42,835
Just-- right.

921
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:43,169
No.

922
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:43,869
No.

923
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:44,235
Oh gosh.

924
00:36:44,237 --> 00:36:44,937
Almost.

925
00:36:44,939 --> 00:36:45,638
Almost.

926
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,237
Can you--

927
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:46,839
Are you OK?

928
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:48,941
[french]

929
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:51,043
Sorry.

930
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:51,844
You're finding it.

931
00:36:51,846 --> 00:36:53,211
Almost.

932
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:53,244
You just need to do a 180.

933
00:36:53,246 --> 00:36:53,614
OK.

934
00:36:57,785 --> 00:36:58,450
[thud]

935
00:36:58,452 --> 00:36:59,819
Oh, goodness.

936
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:00,285
Here.

937
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:00,886
Take my--

938
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:01,821
[french]

939
00:37:01,823 --> 00:37:02,188
OK.

940
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,988
Just--

941
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,254
Here.

942
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:04,355
OK.

943
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:06,058
Now, easy does it.

944
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,291
Easy does it.

945
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:06,959
Voila.

946
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:07,325
Yay.

947
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:10,996
Voila.

948
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:15,266
So you say you have the uncanny
ability to see the past?

949
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:17,002
[french]

950
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:19,038
Indeed I do.

951
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,808
Excuse me, but don't we
all have that ability?

952
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,176
Uh, pardon me, but don't
we all have that ability?

953
00:37:24,178 --> 00:37:25,611
No.

954
00:37:25,613 --> 00:37:27,278
[inaudible] own past.

955
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,246
Everybody can.

956
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:30,683
No one care.

957
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:33,085
But with this power I have,
which I did not ask for,

958
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:36,021
I merely need to be in
the presence of a person

959
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:37,890
and I immediately
see their whole life,

960
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:40,559
like a movie or a play.

961
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:42,895
Again, not like The Dead Zone.

962
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:45,931
It is quite formidable.

963
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,134
And you say that's why you've
come here this evening?

964
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:49,001
Oui.

965
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:50,335
Quite so.

966
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:52,238
But that is not the only reason.

967
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,272
I have been summoned.

968
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:55,207
Summoned?

969
00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:57,475
By whom?

970
00:37:57,477 --> 00:37:58,376
The dead.

971
00:37:58,378 --> 00:38:00,848
[ominous music]

972
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:03,785
The lights are flickering, yes?

973
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:07,452
The dead?

974
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:10,591
[ominous music]

975
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:15,094
Well, that's just
a bit far-fetched.

976
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:16,262
Wouldn't you say, Ms. Clement?

977
00:38:16,264 --> 00:38:16,996
No.

978
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:18,164
No.

979
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,064
It's quite fetched.

980
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:21,399
Is that the correct usage?

981
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:22,400
My English is not so well.

982
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:23,135
No.

983
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:24,570
It's OK.

984
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:26,205
But let me get this straight.

985
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:28,541
You're saying you
communicate with the dead?

986
00:38:28,543 --> 00:38:31,546
[ominous music]

987
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:33,779
Of course.

988
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:36,816
I am a medium, after all.

989
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:38,951
But I not only communicate
with the departed.

990
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:40,553
I bring them--

991
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:42,788
Fascinating, Ms. Clement.

992
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,523
But what does any of
that have to do with me?

993
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:45,791
I don't even--

994
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:46,694
May I have your hand, Bridgette?

995
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:50,930
How did you know my name?

996
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:52,965
You're hand.

997
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:53,833
Oh.

998
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:56,135
It's here.

999
00:38:56,137 --> 00:38:58,403
[screams]

1000
00:38:58,405 --> 00:39:00,039
What is it?

1001
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:03,175
Ma cher, I see
everything clearly.

1002
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:04,710
What do you see?

1003
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:06,846
It is what I do not see.

1004
00:39:06,848 --> 00:39:08,047
What is that?

1005
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:09,515
I do not see a penis.

1006
00:39:09,517 --> 00:39:10,381
Say what?

1007
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:11,283
A penis.

1008
00:39:11,285 --> 00:39:13,018
No?

1009
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,254
I do not see a penis.

1010
00:39:15,256 --> 00:39:17,422
A penis?

1011
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:18,356
What the hell is that?

1012
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:20,726
It's happiness.

1013
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:23,729
It just sounds like "a
penis," because she's French.

1014
00:39:23,731 --> 00:39:26,966
But the audience is going to
think she's saying "a penis."

1015
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:28,868
You think so?

1016
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:29,869
A penis.

1017
00:39:29,871 --> 00:39:31,303
[rewind]

1018
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:32,271
A penis.

1019
00:39:32,273 --> 00:39:33,772
[rewind]

1020
00:39:33,774 --> 00:39:35,473
A penis.

1021
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:36,242
Maybe you're right.

1022
00:39:36,244 --> 00:39:39,111
I'll add this.

1023
00:39:39,113 --> 00:39:43,481
I do not see much
happiness in your life.

1024
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:45,251
She's trying to say "happiness."

1025
00:39:45,253 --> 00:39:46,252
Oui.

1026
00:39:46,254 --> 00:39:47,853
Happiness.

1027
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:48,821
I thought she was saying--

1028
00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:50,756
No.

1029
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:52,324
We know what we
thought she was saying.

1030
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:54,994
Bridgette, there is so
much sadness in your life.

1031
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:55,493
Your father--

1032
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:58,898
Please.

1033
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,767
I don't want to
discuss my father.

1034
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:03,569
There's something
really wrong here.

1035
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:04,435
You don't like where
the story's going?

1036
00:40:04,437 --> 00:40:05,403
No.

1037
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:06,404
It's not that.

1038
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:07,773
It's the characters.

1039
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:08,874
They have no inner lives.

1040
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:11,277
We don't really care about them.

1041
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:12,443
They're just pieces we're
moving around on a chessboard.

1042
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:14,546
You're right.

1043
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:16,282
There's nobody to care
about in this movie--

1044
00:40:16,284 --> 00:40:18,150
play, play.

1045
00:40:18,152 --> 00:40:19,818
We need a moment, a
glimpse into the soul,

1046
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,954
of one of the characters.

1047
00:40:21,956 --> 00:40:22,922
Marie?

1048
00:40:22,924 --> 00:40:24,156
Why Marie?

1049
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:25,724
Well, she's interesting.

1050
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:27,425
She's a blind, French, psychic.

1051
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:28,227
That's the problem.

1052
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:30,396
She's too interesting.

1053
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:32,564
Well, Cooper?

1054
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:33,599
We want to keep him
sort of enigmatic.

1055
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:34,633
Don't we?

1056
00:40:34,635 --> 00:40:35,868
You're right.

1057
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,537
That just leave Bridgette.

1058
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:39,705
I think I've got a
way to go with her.

1059
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:42,741
Oh, a wise guy, eh?

1060
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:44,810
Well, be my guest.

1061
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:45,913
I think this will do it.

1062
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:53,519
You say you do not want
to talk about your life,

1063
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:56,922
but what else have
we but our lives?

1064
00:40:56,924 --> 00:41:01,827
I don't want to talk about my
life, because it's too painful.

1065
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:06,565
You say you do not see
much happiness in my life?

1066
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,634
That's true.

1067
00:41:08,636 --> 00:41:12,271
Also, no love.

1068
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:15,607
That's not exactly true.

1069
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:26,852
I was in love once, with a boy
named Eduardo, Eduardo Gomez

1070
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:31,023
Alfonso de la Guapa.

1071
00:41:31,025 --> 00:41:35,527
My father did everything
he could to break us up.

1072
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:36,195
I'm sorry.

1073
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:37,162
Why is that?

1074
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:40,034
[sorrowful music]

1075
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:49,908
Alfonso was dark complected.

1076
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,912
Even in these enlightened
times of post-racial America,

1077
00:41:53,914 --> 00:41:58,884
my father was hateful.

1078
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:06,158
He systematically destroyed
our love, had Eduardo deported,

1079
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,663
and forced me to have
a late-term abortion.

1080
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:17,970
Afterward, I hated my
father with a passion.

1081
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:22,941
My mother insisted that my
father had acted out of love.

1082
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:27,846
But I saw no love
in his actions.

1083
00:42:27,848 --> 00:42:31,917
I, determined to spend
the rest of my life

1084
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:38,257
defying his authority,
flaunting his prejudices,

1085
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:42,428
I had many public affairs.

1086
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:49,368
Black men, Brown
men, even women.

1087
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:53,806
You should've seen my
father froth at the mouth

1088
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:58,377
at the idea of his poor
sweet little daughter

1089
00:42:58,379 --> 00:42:59,146
becoming a lesbian.

1090
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:06,685
That was the final straw.

1091
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:12,191
He threw me out and
disinherited me.

1092
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:15,260
I swore revenge.

1093
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:20,599
And nothing can stand in my
way, no code of morals or ethics

1094
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:22,569
or laws.

1095
00:43:22,571 --> 00:43:24,770
I'm my own.

1096
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:29,808
I own me.

1097
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:30,377
And scene.

1098
00:43:41,155 --> 00:43:42,187
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1099
00:43:42,189 --> 00:43:43,388
She's a racist?

1100
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,857
No, but her father is.

1101
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:46,792
And she's trying
to get back at him.

1102
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:49,928
I hate it.

1103
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,931
It is a little overblown
with the Judy Garland spot.

1104
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:55,300
I just don't think we need it.

1105
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:57,102
I mean, why do we
care about her past?

1106
00:43:57,104 --> 00:43:58,737
We know she's a psychopath.

1107
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:00,105
That's all we need
to know about her.

1108
00:44:00,107 --> 00:44:00,607
OK.

1109
00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:01,306
Cut it.

1110
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:04,176
It's cut.

1111
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:09,214
Now, let's up the stakes here.

1112
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:10,983
So you say you were summoned
here by dead people?

1113
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:12,384
Oui.

1114
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:15,721
But it was very confusion.

1115
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:19,691
I was summoned by a poulet.

1116
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:21,793
Oh, no.

1117
00:44:21,795 --> 00:44:24,531
A poulet?

1118
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:26,265
You mean a chicken?

1119
00:44:26,267 --> 00:44:27,366
Oui.

1120
00:44:27,368 --> 00:44:29,636
But not a chicken.

1121
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:31,336
It was very, very confusion.

1122
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:32,572
Yes.

1123
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:35,874
It is very confusion.

1124
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:37,776
Could you give us
just a moment, please?

1125
00:44:37,778 --> 00:44:39,311
But of course.

1126
00:44:39,313 --> 00:44:40,746
Not a problem.

1127
00:44:40,748 --> 00:44:40,948
Oh.

1128
00:44:44,553 --> 00:44:47,152
I sense you have some champagne.

1129
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:49,421
Oh, yes.

1130
00:44:49,423 --> 00:44:50,889
Should I--

1131
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:51,924
No, no, no.

1132
00:44:51,926 --> 00:44:53,325
It will speak to me.

1133
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:57,062
I am a medium.

1134
00:44:57,064 --> 00:44:59,266
Bring some spirits back from
the dead, including alcohol.

1135
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:03,636
[ominous music]

1136
00:45:03,638 --> 00:45:05,003
We have to get rid of her.

1137
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:06,972
What can she know?

1138
00:45:06,974 --> 00:45:09,808
She knows about
the chicken suit.

1139
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,810
I want to find out
what else she knows.

1140
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:15,781
You play a very dangerous
game, Bridgette.

1141
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:18,551
Haven't you figured me out yet?

1142
00:45:18,553 --> 00:45:22,555
Danger is my middle name.

1143
00:45:22,557 --> 00:45:24,456
Sure thing.

1144
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:26,825
But what about me?

1145
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:28,227
I don't know your middle name.

1146
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:29,161
Shirley.

1147
00:45:29,163 --> 00:45:30,495
Shirley?

1148
00:45:30,497 --> 00:45:30,998
William Goldberg III, yes.

1149
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:35,535
Shirley.

1150
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:37,469
I'm curious, Ms. Clement.

1151
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:39,505
No, it's not two.

1152
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:40,607
Um.

1153
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:42,642
Marie, please.

1154
00:45:42,644 --> 00:45:44,142
I am not so formal.

1155
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:46,211
Oui.

1156
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:48,113
Marie, then.

1157
00:45:48,115 --> 00:45:52,084
How exactly do the dead
communicate with you?

1158
00:45:52,086 --> 00:45:53,653
It is very interesting.

1159
00:45:53,655 --> 00:45:56,088
I get a cryptic--

1160
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,422
is that the word?

1161
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,925
--a cryptic message.

1162
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:05,197
A word, a phrase, like a
text message in my mind.

1163
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,934
So the dead text message you?

1164
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:12,404
Yes, like a text,
but not exactly.

1165
00:46:12,406 --> 00:46:14,439
Then, they tell me where to go
and it must have the seance.

1166
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:15,675
A seance?

1167
00:46:15,677 --> 00:46:16,743
Is that necessary?

1168
00:46:16,745 --> 00:46:17,776
Mademoiselle Bridgette.

1169
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:18,977
Yes?

1170
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:21,480
Yes, I am talking to you.

1171
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:23,650
There is a departed soul who
wishes to communicate with you.

1172
00:46:23,652 --> 00:46:26,552
It is tres, tres necessary.

1173
00:46:26,554 --> 00:46:28,521
Well, then, let's have a seance.

1174
00:46:28,523 --> 00:46:30,022
[french]

1175
00:46:30,024 --> 00:46:31,691
Bridgette.

1176
00:46:31,693 --> 00:46:33,859
What's the worst
that can happen?

1177
00:46:33,861 --> 00:46:35,695
Either nothing or some
disembodied spirit

1178
00:46:35,697 --> 00:46:39,131
raps on a table?

1179
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:42,901
I must warn you, I'm not
like the other medium.

1180
00:46:42,903 --> 00:46:46,471
Not only can I summon the souls
of the departed, I summon--

1181
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:47,740
Whatever.

1182
00:46:47,742 --> 00:46:50,475
Sounds like fun.

1183
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:51,644
Fuck it.

1184
00:46:51,646 --> 00:46:52,277
Let's have some fun.

1185
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:54,346
[giggling]

1186
00:46:54,348 --> 00:46:56,348
I think this is where the
intermission should go.

1187
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,016
Intermission?

1188
00:46:58,018 --> 00:46:59,084
What do we need an
intermission for?

1189
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:00,620
Movies don't have intermissions?

1190
00:47:00,622 --> 00:47:01,688
Well, they used to.

1191
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,021
I remember seeing Ben-Hur.

1192
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:04,389
They had a long intermission.

1193
00:47:04,391 --> 00:47:06,491
Well, yeah.

1194
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,460
For one thing, Ben-Hur
was, like, four hours long.

1195
00:47:08,462 --> 00:47:11,196
And for another thing, no movies
have intermissions anymore.

1196
00:47:11,198 --> 00:47:13,065
This is not a movie.

1197
00:47:13,067 --> 00:47:14,701
And theatergoers
expect an intermission.

1198
00:47:14,703 --> 00:47:16,335
I hate intermissions.

1199
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:18,437
I mean, why give the
audience the chance

1200
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:21,039
to go out and discuss the
play at the halfway point?

1201
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:23,041
What if someone's like
really enjoying the play

1202
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:24,644
and they overhear
somebody else saying,

1203
00:47:24,646 --> 00:47:26,378
gee, this plays sucks, and
it changes their attitude

1204
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,446
entirely?

1205
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:29,047
That never happens.

1206
00:47:29,049 --> 00:47:31,216
Besides maybe the
reverse can happen.

1207
00:47:31,218 --> 00:47:33,051
Somebody could think the play
sucks, go out in the lobby,

1208
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:35,555
hear someone else raving
about it, and say,

1209
00:47:35,557 --> 00:47:39,191
I must've missed something
that guy obviously appreciates.

1210
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:40,760
Besides, what about the
women who have to pee?

1211
00:47:40,762 --> 00:47:43,228
Men have to pee too.

1212
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,832
Have you ever seen the
line outside the restroom

1213
00:47:45,834 --> 00:47:47,466
during the
intermission of a play?

1214
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:49,468
The women are lined up
from here to Zanzibar.

1215
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,537
The men go in, unzip,
pee, and they're out again

1216
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:53,706
in 10 seconds.

1217
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:55,207
Nobody ever leaves in the
middle of a movie to pee.

1218
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:56,743
This isn't a movie.

1219
00:47:56,745 --> 00:47:59,010
It's a play.

1220
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:00,979
Besides, the little
black box theaters

1221
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:03,248
need time to sell their
drinks and snacks.

1222
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,117
Oh, yes.

1223
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,153
The old $1 worth of
white wine for $8.

1224
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:10,155
What a value.

1225
00:48:10,157 --> 00:48:11,356
They need to make
their money somewhere.

1226
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:12,725
They're not making
it at the box office.

1227
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:13,793
All right.

1228
00:48:13,795 --> 00:48:14,259
You made your point.

1229
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:15,728
OK.

1230
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,063
We'll put the intermission here.

1231
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:20,533
Now, for some reason,
I have to pee.

1232
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:23,370
[chuckle]

1233
00:48:31,145 --> 00:48:32,645
Ladies and gentlemen, that
concludes the first act

1234
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:34,814
of our performance.

1235
00:48:34,816 --> 00:48:36,582
Please feel free to enjoy some
refreshments in the lobby.

1236
00:48:36,584 --> 00:48:37,916
And when the lights
flicker, make your way

1237
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:38,618
back to your seats.

1238
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,255

[retro western music]

1240
00:48:51,465 --> 00:48:53,432
Ah, fuck it.

1241
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:54,734
This play is too short
for an intermission.

1242
00:48:54,736 --> 00:48:55,967
You're right.

1243
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:56,569
Let's go right into act two.

1244
00:48:56,571 --> 00:48:57,637
All right.

1245
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,971
OK, ball, you are ready?

1246
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:02,409
[chanting]

1247
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:18,490

1249
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:22,562
No, no, no.

1250
00:49:22,564 --> 00:49:23,729
Just the tip.

1251
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:24,597
What does all that mean?

1252
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,632
Shh.

1253
00:49:26,634 --> 00:49:29,267
You must remain silent
during the incantation.

1254
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:31,537
The spirits are very
restless tonight.

1255
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:32,971
Sorry.

1256
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:34,607
This is my first seance.

1257
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:35,775
[inaudible]

1258
00:49:35,777 --> 00:49:38,310
No, no.

1259
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:40,479
You must not touch
the summoning candle.

1260
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:42,849
It must remain lit
for the duration.

1267
00:50:13,848 --> 00:50:16,816
Bridgette?

1268
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:19,619
Bridgette.

1269
00:50:19,621 --> 00:50:21,152
Oh God.

1270
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:23,823
That's Nancy Babcock's voice.

1271
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:25,625
Oh, good Lord.

1272
00:50:25,627 --> 00:50:26,926
I only ever heard her
screaming in pain.

1273
00:50:26,928 --> 00:50:28,159
I mean--

1274
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:28,462
It doesn't matter.

1275
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:35,835
Marie has checked out.

1276
00:50:35,837 --> 00:50:38,336
Shit.

1277
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:43,776
Bridgette, don't you want
any more of my cookies?

1278
00:50:43,778 --> 00:50:45,210
No, I don't.

1279
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:48,581
I never liked your cookies.

1280
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,583
Whore.

1281
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:55,988
You there, boy, what did
I ever do to harm you?

1282
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:56,989
Nothing, actually.

1283
00:50:56,991 --> 00:50:58,290
Nothing at all.

1284
00:50:58,292 --> 00:51:01,059
Then, why did you send me here?

1285
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:05,163
It's so cold and damp.

1286
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:07,700
I'm so sorry.

1287
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:10,603
You know, if I could
do it all over again--

1288
00:51:10,605 --> 00:51:13,271
Yes?

1289
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:14,740
I'd still kill you.

1290
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:17,108
Just being honest.

1291
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:17,679
I do love that about you.

1292
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:24,917
Who the fuck ruined my roses?

1293
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:27,520
David?

1294
00:51:27,522 --> 00:51:31,356
I tended those
roses for 30 years.

1295
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:33,926
And now, I'm
fertilizer for them.

1296
00:51:33,928 --> 00:51:35,193
Hey, come on.

1297
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:36,261
I put a lot of effort into that.

1298
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:37,128
I was trying to be thoughtful.

1299
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,664
Thoughtful?

1300
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:40,967
You buried me with
that shrew I've

1301
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:44,070
been stuck with since I was 23.

1302
00:51:44,072 --> 00:51:46,438
Shut up, you old fart.

1303
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,675
Oh, get your fat ass
back in the kitchen.

1304
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,913
I always thought of them as
a particularly loving couple.

1305
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:55,581
Yeah.

1306
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:57,550
They seemed so
compatible the way

1307
00:51:57,552 --> 00:52:00,720
they screamed each other's
names when they died.

1308
00:52:00,722 --> 00:52:03,689
You just can't tell what
goes on behind closed doors.

1309
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:05,423
It's true.

1310
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:05,560
Who knows what
they're really up to?

1311
00:52:08,997 --> 00:52:11,030
They are gone.

1312
00:52:11,032 --> 00:52:13,465
Of course, I remember nothing.

1313
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:14,834
Did you get a message?

1314
00:52:14,836 --> 00:52:17,302
Oh, not really.

1315
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:20,171
Just some old
neighbors dropping by.

1316
00:52:20,173 --> 00:52:22,775
That is very strange.

1317
00:52:22,777 --> 00:52:26,846
There was a very powerful and
angry spirit which summoned me.

1318
00:52:26,848 --> 00:52:28,080
OK.

1319
00:52:28,082 --> 00:52:28,814
Well, we try again, huh?

1320
00:52:28,816 --> 00:52:29,115
Oh, please.

1321
00:52:29,117 --> 00:52:31,416
No.

1322
00:52:31,418 --> 00:52:32,217
You don't need to go
to any more trouble.

1323
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:34,185
It's been very interesting.

1324
00:52:34,187 --> 00:52:35,387
But enough is enough.

1325
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:36,122
[frantic music]

1326
00:52:36,124 --> 00:52:38,458
[chanting]

1327
00:52:45,033 --> 00:52:45,865
[bark]

1328
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:47,833
[panting]

1329
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:49,635
Milo?

1330
00:52:49,637 --> 00:52:51,070
You said you didn't kill him.

1331
00:52:51,072 --> 00:52:51,771
I know.

1332
00:52:51,773 --> 00:52:53,773
I know.

1333
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:55,808
He looked so sad without
the food and water he--

1334
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,743
and he also started to
eat David's eyeball.

1335
00:52:57,745 --> 00:52:59,210
Oh.

1336
00:52:59,212 --> 00:53:01,246
I know.

1337
00:53:01,248 --> 00:53:02,915
It's like in less
than half a day,

1338
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:04,917
a dog can go from loving
the shit out of you

1339
00:53:04,919 --> 00:53:09,021
to eating your eyeball
out of your dead corpse.

1340
00:53:09,023 --> 00:53:11,526
[thudding]

1341
00:53:13,094 --> 00:53:15,594
Finally.

1342
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:17,630
I've been trying to reach
you guys for 20 minutes.

1343
00:53:17,632 --> 00:53:19,165
But the only thing I'm getting
from this French lunatic

1344
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:20,099
is a busy signal.

1345
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:21,967
Blain?

1346
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:23,035
Yes, Blain.

1347
00:53:23,037 --> 00:53:23,769
Who'd you think it was?

1348
00:53:23,771 --> 00:53:25,738
Elvis?

1349
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,606
Do you have any idea
how frustrating it is

1350
00:53:27,608 --> 00:53:30,442
to be on hold when you're dead?

1351
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:34,013
Coop, I am very
disappointed in you.

1352
00:53:34,015 --> 00:53:36,281
I didn't know she was
going to shoot you.

1353
00:53:36,283 --> 00:53:38,117
You didn't seem to give
a fuck that she did.

1354
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:39,051
Hey.

1355
00:53:39,053 --> 00:53:40,186
You know me.

1356
00:53:40,188 --> 00:53:42,855
I go with the flow.

1357
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:44,056
Hey.

1358
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:44,957
You wanted to kill me.

1359
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:46,291
Remember?

1360
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:48,160
In a particularly bloody way.

1361
00:53:48,162 --> 00:53:50,196
But I didn't.

1362
00:53:50,198 --> 00:53:51,396
There's a difference between
wanting to commit murder

1363
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:54,466
and murdering someone.

1364
00:53:54,468 --> 00:53:57,603
Apparently, you
didn't know that.

1365
00:53:57,605 --> 00:53:59,505
And now, you're going
to have to face--

1366
00:53:59,507 --> 00:54:01,173
--the consequences.

1367
00:54:01,175 --> 00:54:03,542
Consequences.

1368
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:05,177
What consequences?

1369
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:06,879
You're just a ghost.

1370
00:54:06,881 --> 00:54:08,681
Am I?

1371
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:10,850
Marie here's been
trying to tell you

1372
00:54:10,852 --> 00:54:12,350
that she isn't just any old
French, blind, psychic medium.

1373
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:13,919
No, no, no.

1374
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:16,454
She does much, much
more than that.

1375
00:54:16,456 --> 00:54:17,957
See that candle over there?

1376
00:54:17,959 --> 00:54:19,992
Yeah.

1377
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:22,561
That's an ancient
Egyptian summoning candle.

1378
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:25,296
It was used by
Isis, not that ISIS,

1379
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:27,800
to raise Osiris from the dead.

1380
00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:30,401
Not only does Marie
summon the soul

1381
00:54:30,403 --> 00:54:32,470
of the departed, she summons--

1382
00:54:32,472 --> 00:54:34,173
- The body.

1383
00:54:34,175 --> 00:54:36,944
[ominous music]

1384
00:54:43,184 --> 00:54:44,116
Hey.

1385
00:54:44,118 --> 00:54:46,185
I'm back.

1386
00:54:46,187 --> 00:54:47,452
Great to be back.

1387
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:48,621
I'm just, you know, dead.

1388
00:54:48,623 --> 00:54:51,924
Ah.

1389
00:54:51,926 --> 00:54:54,627
You remember what a really,
really bad hangover feels like?

1390
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:56,427
Yeah, well, this kind
of feels like that

1391
00:54:56,429 --> 00:55:00,298
plus the overwhelming
desire to eat brains.

1392
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,667
What kind of zombie are you?

1393
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:03,202
Huh?

1394
00:55:03,204 --> 00:55:05,070
Zombies don't talk.

1395
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:06,839
What?

1396
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:08,473
Everything you
know about zombies

1397
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:09,742
you know from the movies.

1398
00:55:09,744 --> 00:55:11,911
That doesn't make them true.

1399
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:14,647
Those movies don't
get anything right.

1400
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:15,981
What about the brains thing?

1401
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:18,150
Nah, I made that up.

1402
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:19,652
I mean, what possible good
could eating brains do?

1403
00:55:19,654 --> 00:55:21,352
Really, think about it.

1404
00:55:21,354 --> 00:55:23,222
No.

1405
00:55:23,224 --> 00:55:24,924
I just want to kill you.

1406
00:55:24,926 --> 00:55:26,326
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

1407
00:55:29,197 --> 00:55:30,563
Zombie?

1408
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:31,396
Are you kidding me?

1409
00:55:31,398 --> 00:55:32,330
What?

1410
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:33,032
Zombies are hot.

1411
00:55:33,034 --> 00:55:34,867
Hot?

1412
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:36,467
There are five
million zombie movies.

1413
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:39,004
There's The Walking
Dead and 28 Days Later

1414
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:42,473
and Zombieland and Shaun
of the Dead and Night

1415
00:55:42,475 --> 00:55:45,177
of the Living Dead and Return
of the Living Dead and Dawn

1416
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:47,046
of the Dead and Day of the
Dead and Afternoon of the Dead.

1417
00:55:47,048 --> 00:55:47,847
I missed that one.

1418
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:49,782
Whatever.

1419
00:55:49,784 --> 00:55:51,016
Zombies are played
out, finished, over.

1420
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:53,219
Hardly.

1421
00:55:53,221 --> 00:55:55,486
That's why they keep
making new ones every year.

1422
00:55:55,488 --> 00:55:58,356
It's money in the
bank, a zombie movie.

1423
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:01,293
This, in case I haven't
made it sufficiently clear,

1424
00:56:01,295 --> 00:56:02,828
is not a movie.

1425
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:04,096
It's a play.

1426
00:56:04,098 --> 00:56:05,097
Fine.

1427
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:07,266
It's a zombie play then.

1428
00:56:07,268 --> 00:56:09,568
There certainly aren't
too many of those around.

1429
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,971
That's because
theatergoers want something

1430
00:56:11,973 --> 00:56:14,506
more than just the
regurgitated pap

1431
00:56:14,508 --> 00:56:17,276
they can get any day of the
week at their local multiplex.

1432
00:56:17,278 --> 00:56:20,279
Oh, people who go
to the theater.

1433
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:23,414
You really don't like
common people, do you?

1434
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:25,284
What do you mean by that?

1435
00:56:25,286 --> 00:56:27,452
Well, you've turned your
nose up at popular culture,

1436
00:56:27,454 --> 00:56:29,255
as if they're stupid.

1437
00:56:29,257 --> 00:56:30,756
What's wrong with a
little commercial success?

1438
00:56:30,758 --> 00:56:32,157
You've got it all wrong.

1439
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:33,726
It's not that I dislike people.

1440
00:56:33,728 --> 00:56:34,793
I just want to
give them something

1441
00:56:34,795 --> 00:56:36,262
worthwhile, thought-provoking.

1442
00:56:36,264 --> 00:56:37,129
Oh, really?

1443
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:38,898
12 people at a time?

1444
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,200
With a movie, you
can reach millions.

1445
00:56:41,202 --> 00:56:43,502
You can write a movie
on your own time.

1446
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:46,538
We agreed to write a play.

1447
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,373
All right.

1448
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:50,242
All right.

1449
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:53,478
I just want to write a play that
could be adapted into a movie.

1450
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,148
Besides, this is
only the first draft.

1451
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:59,385
Why don't we play it out to the
end and see how we feel then?

1452
00:56:59,387 --> 00:57:01,954
Whatever.

1453
00:57:01,956 --> 00:57:04,556
I just don't want to keep having
the same argument with you.

1454
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:05,391
Now, where are we?

1455
00:57:05,393 --> 00:57:05,824
All right.

1456
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:08,193
OK.

1457
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:10,696
What I have is that the
David and Nancy zombies come

1458
00:57:10,698 --> 00:57:11,997
crashing back into the room.

1459
00:57:11,999 --> 00:57:12,765
Two more zombies?

1460
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:13,666
Are you kidding me?

1461
00:57:13,668 --> 00:57:15,433
We can't have that.

1462
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:17,102
How are you going
to get two actors

1463
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:20,205
to audition for non-speaking
zombie roles in a play?

1464
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:22,308
Well, you know, in
a movie, there are

1465
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,243
thousands of extras lining up.

1466
00:57:24,245 --> 00:57:26,011
Again, that's a movie.

1467
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:28,547
This is a play.

1468
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:32,851
How then, are we going to
explain that Blain comes back

1469
00:57:32,853 --> 00:57:35,421
as a zombie, but
David and Nancy don't?

1470
00:57:35,423 --> 00:57:36,188
I don't know.

1471
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,189
This is so stupid.

1472
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:37,990
[suspenseful music]

1473
00:57:37,992 --> 00:57:38,524
All right.

1474
00:57:38,526 --> 00:57:39,825
I've got.

1475
00:57:39,827 --> 00:57:39,961
I think I've got something.

1476
00:57:44,932 --> 00:57:48,901
Brains.

1477
00:57:48,903 --> 00:57:52,571
David and Nancy are staggering
across the lawn, very slowly.

1478
00:57:52,573 --> 00:57:53,973
They're going to take
at least 20 minutes.

1479
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:55,541
Oh, they don't look so good.

1480
00:57:55,543 --> 00:57:58,177
Brains.

1481
00:57:58,179 --> 00:57:58,846
Big brains.

1482
00:58:02,283 --> 00:58:03,649
We have to do something.

1483
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:06,518
Yes, you have to die.

1484
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,887
But don't worry.

1485
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:10,589
It's not so bad, once you
get past the worms eating

1486
00:58:10,591 --> 00:58:12,624
your flesh.

1487
00:58:12,626 --> 00:58:14,693
The medium, this has all
happened because of her.

1488
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:15,995
You're right.

1489
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:16,996
We have to snap her out of it.

1490
00:58:16,998 --> 00:58:18,263
You fend off Blain while I try.

1491
00:58:18,265 --> 00:58:19,898
Yes.

1492
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,000
Marie.

1493
00:58:21,002 --> 00:58:23,235
Marie, wake up.

1494
00:58:23,237 --> 00:58:26,138
Marie, you have to wake up.

1495
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:29,141
Bridgette, I miss you.

1496
00:58:29,143 --> 00:58:32,311
Ay, dios mio.

1497
00:58:32,313 --> 00:58:33,779
Eduardo?

1498
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:35,214
I miss you, cara mia.

1499
00:58:35,216 --> 00:58:35,616
You're dead?

1500
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,186
It's so hot in here.

1501
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:42,254
Ay, dios mio.

1502
00:58:42,256 --> 00:58:43,722
[inaudible]

1503
00:58:43,724 --> 00:58:45,257
You're in hell?

1504
00:58:45,259 --> 00:58:47,826
No, in Ecuador.

1505
00:58:47,828 --> 00:58:49,962
Enough with Eduardo.

1506
00:58:49,964 --> 00:58:51,296
She's just connecting
with the dearly departed,

1507
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:51,699
like the dearly deported.

1508
00:58:57,338 --> 00:59:00,906
(SINGING) Happy birthday to you.

1509
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:06,612
Happy birthday to you.

1510
00:59:06,614 --> 00:59:13,352
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

1511
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:17,489
Oh, why do I always get the
fuzzy end of the lollipop?

1512
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:21,193
Jack, if you don't call me back,
I'm going to take all these--

1513
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:22,828
--pills.

1514
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,997
Now, she's Marilyn Monroe.

1515
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:26,598
Is she buried in
the rose garden too?

1516
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,333
No.

1517
00:59:28,335 --> 00:59:30,503
She's just a disembodied spirit.

1518
00:59:30,505 --> 00:59:32,571
Haven't you heard that
sometimes happens to suicides?

1519
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:33,806
Keep going.

1520
00:59:33,808 --> 00:59:34,573
What should I do?

1521
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:35,207
I don't know.

1522
00:59:35,209 --> 00:59:36,875
But do it fast.

1523
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:39,011
Chicken Boy's wearing
me the fuck out.

1524
00:59:39,013 --> 00:59:40,212
I should've been Freddy Krueger.

1525
00:59:40,214 --> 00:59:41,548
No.

1526
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:42,214
It's a good chicken suit.

00:59:55,196 --> 00:59:56,028
Shit.

1531

[grunting]

1532
01:00:01,435 --> 01:00:04,303
You haven't seen the last of me.

1533
01:00:04,305 --> 01:00:06,672
I'll be back.

[panting]

01:00:34,335 --> 01:00:42,474
Bridgette, was it
really necessary?

[squirting]

1539
01:00:46,714 --> 01:00:49,648
Apparently.

1540
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,417
This is all insane.

1541
01:00:52,419 --> 01:00:53,252
Yes, it is.

1542
01:00:53,254 --> 01:00:56,455
I know.

1543
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:57,322
But it's over now.

Seriously?

1548
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:16,475
Kung Fu and Karate?

1549
01:01:16,477 --> 01:01:18,744
How are we going to do that?

1550
01:01:18,746 --> 01:01:20,547
We'll use stunt
doubles, of course.

1551
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:21,648
It's a movie.

1552
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,516
No one will ever know.

1553
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:27,554
It's a fucking play.

I might be some bloody
poultry, but you're no match

01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:05,157
for my Kung Fu stylings.

1558

Let's go then, Kung Pao chicken.

Let's go, Cooper.

How is this happening?

01:02:30,951 --> 01:02:33,151
I killed Marie?

1563
01:02:33,153 --> 01:02:34,587
Must be the fact that the
candle's still burning.

1564
01:02:34,589 --> 01:02:35,521
You get to the candle.

1565
01:02:35,523 --> 01:02:36,355
I'll handle chicken boy.

1566
01:02:36,357 --> 01:02:36,755
All right?

1567
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:36,957

choreograph any more.

Hey, that's a great title.

I can't believe my name
is going to be on this.

01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,630
Are you kidding me?

1580
01:03:50,632 --> 01:03:52,364
This is great stuff.

01:03:52,366 --> 01:03:54,266
Boy, oh, boy.

1582
01:03:54,268 --> 01:03:54,968
Wait till you read the
ending I come up with.

1583
01:04:00,675 --> 01:04:01,873
To us.

[romantic piano music]

1585
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:02,309
To us.

1586
01:04:06,914 --> 01:04:09,816
It has been quite an evening.

1587
01:04:09,818 --> 01:04:12,785
Yes, it has.

1588
01:04:12,787 --> 01:04:14,986
It's a good thing that bit
with the candle worked.

1589
01:04:14,988 --> 01:04:16,756
I was about to be
zombied to death.

1590
01:04:16,758 --> 01:04:19,324
That's right.

1591
01:04:19,326 --> 01:04:22,427
I was about to be pecked to
death by a zombie chicken.

1592
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:25,230
Wow.

1593
01:04:25,232 --> 01:04:25,631
I've definitely done enough
digging in that rose garden.

1594
01:04:25,633 --> 01:04:26,398
That's for sure.

1595
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,232
Four bodies?

1596
01:04:27,234 --> 01:04:29,034
Yeah, that's enough.

1597
01:04:29,036 --> 01:04:29,604
Thank goodness there's you.

1598
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:35,775
Yeah.

1599
01:04:35,777 --> 01:04:37,810
You're pretty remarkable.

1600
01:04:37,812 --> 01:04:40,145
As are you.

1601
01:04:40,147 --> 01:04:42,414
We're sort of made
for each other.

1602
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:43,583
I think so.

[giggling]

1604
01:04:50,991 --> 01:04:52,792
I don't think this is what
romantic comedy writers would

1605
01:04:52,794 --> 01:04:53,628
call a "meet cute."

1606
01:04:56,631 --> 01:04:58,330
A meet cute?

1607
01:04:58,332 --> 01:05:00,600
Yes.

1608
01:05:00,602 --> 01:05:03,536
You know, when the boy
meets the girl in the movie.

1609
01:05:03,538 --> 01:05:06,138
She's having an online romance
with him, but doesn't know it.

1610
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:09,908
Or he's a widow who
goes on the radio

1611
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:11,109
and she falls in
love with his voice.

1612
01:05:11,111 --> 01:05:15,914
Or, well, you know.

1613
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:19,951
I mean, what like a Tom
Hanks-Meg Ryan kind of thing?

1614
01:05:19,953 --> 01:05:21,687
Yes, exactly.

1615
01:05:21,689 --> 01:05:22,555
OK.

1616
01:05:22,557 --> 01:05:22,789
For sure.

1617
01:05:22,791 --> 01:05:23,890
OK.

1618
01:05:23,892 --> 01:05:24,456
That shit's crazy.

1619
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,592
Yeah.

1620
01:05:26,594 --> 01:05:27,727
Some people don't even
think that a triple murder

1621
01:05:27,729 --> 01:05:29,327
is that romantic.

1622
01:05:29,329 --> 01:05:30,663
I know.

1623
01:05:30,665 --> 01:05:33,064
I guess some people don't.

1624
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:36,268
That's why we're so
right for each other.

1625
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,003
There aren't many people
capable of accomplishing

1626
01:05:38,005 --> 01:05:38,970
what we've done together.

1627
01:05:38,972 --> 01:05:41,607
That's damn right.

01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:49,116
That's why I feel so bad.

01:05:51,786 --> 01:05:53,351
Bad?

1631
01:05:53,353 --> 01:05:55,822
Why?

1632
01:05:55,824 --> 01:05:57,824
You might've noticed that
it's getting a bit difficult

1633
01:05:57,826 --> 01:05:58,658
to move your extremities.

1634
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,092
[eerie music]

01:06:01,094 --> 01:06:02,262
I put a little something
in your champagne.

1636
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:07,600
I'm sorry, but I
still need someone

1637
01:06:07,602 --> 01:06:09,468
to blame the Picasso on.

1638
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:11,904
And, well, Blain is
buried in the rose garden.

1639
01:06:11,906 --> 01:06:12,239
So--

1640
01:06:15,577 --> 01:06:18,746
Was it-- was this
really necessary?

1641
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:24,951
I think so.

1642
01:06:24,953 --> 01:06:25,818
I can't feel my body.

1643
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:28,288
[grunting]

1644
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:33,425
You can still feel
your mouth, apparently.

1645
01:06:33,427 --> 01:06:34,794
Psych.

1646
01:06:34,796 --> 01:06:37,998
[chuckling]

1647
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:46,772
I don't drink champagne.

1648
01:06:46,774 --> 01:06:48,106
What do you mean?

1649
01:06:48,108 --> 01:06:50,943
I saw you drink it all day.

1650
01:06:50,945 --> 01:06:52,645
You should pay more attention.

1651
01:06:52,647 --> 01:06:54,947
I actually didn't eat
or drink a single thing

1652
01:06:54,949 --> 01:06:56,616
since I've been here.

1653
01:06:56,618 --> 01:06:57,917
Thank you.

1654
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,117
Am I?

1655
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,452
I'm good with this.

1656
01:07:00,454 --> 01:07:03,288
To us.

1657
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,857
Well, the police
will never believe

1658
01:07:04,859 --> 01:07:06,893
that I could've disarmed him.

1659
01:07:06,895 --> 01:07:08,828
Why is that?

1660
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:13,064
Because, one second--

1661
01:07:13,066 --> 01:07:13,400
OK.

1662
01:07:26,313 --> 01:07:33,385
Because I intend to drink now.

1663
01:07:33,387 --> 01:07:35,320
I have no idea
what you're saying.

1664
01:07:35,322 --> 01:07:42,394
I said- I intend to drink now.

1665
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:43,829
There's something really
distracting in your mouth.

1666
01:07:43,831 --> 01:07:46,632
I just can't.

1667
01:07:46,634 --> 01:07:48,534
You're killing recalling the
fucking moment [mumbling]..

1668
01:07:48,536 --> 01:07:49,602
Huh?

1669
01:07:49,604 --> 01:07:51,037
Fuck.

1670
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,305
I don't--

1671
01:07:53,307 --> 01:07:57,075
Because I intend to drink now.

1672
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:58,811
[ominous organ chords]

1673
01:07:58,813 --> 01:07:59,645
Oh, you're a vampire.

1674
01:07:59,647 --> 01:08:00,813
Good.

1675
01:08:00,815 --> 01:08:01,013
You picked up on that.

1676
01:08:01,015 --> 01:08:01,948
Yes.

1677
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:02,982
Finally.

1678
01:08:02,984 --> 01:08:04,684
Thank you.

1679
01:08:04,686 --> 01:08:06,719
I had to put this
shit for you to--

1680
01:08:06,721 --> 01:08:07,185
you get it.

1681
01:08:07,187 --> 01:08:07,787
I'm a vampire.

1682
01:08:07,789 --> 01:08:08,688
Right?

1683
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,121
Yes.

1684
01:08:10,123 --> 01:08:10,088
I can put this in my pocket now.

1685
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:10,790
Yeah?

1686
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:11,857
Yeah.

1687
01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:13,491
Sorry.

1688
01:08:13,493 --> 01:08:16,896
Now, I don't know
how I missed it.

1689
01:08:16,898 --> 01:08:17,630
Yes.

1690
01:08:17,632 --> 01:08:20,131
Yes.

1691
01:08:20,133 --> 01:08:23,335
Hey, you know how I said I slit
the Babcocks' throats earlier?

1692
01:08:23,337 --> 01:08:24,436
Bit their throats.

1693
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:25,738
Fucking bit those throats.

1694
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:26,438
You bit them.

1695
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,106
You want to know why?

1696
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:28,774
You want to know why?

1697
01:08:28,776 --> 01:08:30,408
I do.

1698
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:31,176
Because that's how
I roll, brother.

1699
01:08:31,178 --> 01:08:32,277
That's how I roll.

1700
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:34,412
I bite throats.

1701
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,682
Well, this is perfect.

1702
01:08:36,684 --> 01:08:39,819
Now, you can turn
me into a vampire

1703
01:08:39,821 --> 01:08:42,356
and we can keep killing and
killing for all eternity.

1704
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:47,593
That shit would be dope.

1705
01:08:47,595 --> 01:08:47,595
Mhm.

1706
01:08:55,970 --> 01:09:05,310
But, unfortunately, nah.

1707
01:09:05,312 --> 01:09:06,246
I'm too much of a
commitment-phobe.

1708
01:09:08,983 --> 01:09:11,517
Yeah.

1709
01:09:11,519 --> 01:09:12,051
Couldn't have you around
like that, not too much, not

1710
01:09:12,053 --> 01:09:12,818
too much.

1711
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:13,019
Oh, shit.

1712
01:09:13,021 --> 01:09:13,387
No.

1713
01:09:18,026 --> 01:09:18,392
But I'll tell you what.

1714
01:09:22,563 --> 01:09:24,930
I'll keep that
summoning candle shit

1715
01:09:24,932 --> 01:09:28,701
and I'll summon you
back, from time to time,

1716
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:30,936
like it's a booty call, like
a vamp and chill or some shit.

1717
01:09:30,938 --> 01:09:31,737
Yeah.

1718
01:09:31,739 --> 01:09:32,437
Yeah.

1719
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:34,006
We could do that.

1720
01:09:34,008 --> 01:09:35,206
We could do that.

1721
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:37,677
We could.

1722
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:42,213
So you do care something for me.

1723
01:09:42,215 --> 01:09:45,918
I knew we had a connection.

1724
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,623
[screaming]

1725
01:09:49,991 --> 01:09:52,958
What?

1726
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,129
You just so happened to have
a wooden fucking stake on you?

1727
01:09:57,131 --> 01:09:59,665
I lied about my last name.

1728
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,366
It isn't Nelson.

1729
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:03,401
It's Van Helsing.

1730
01:10:03,403 --> 01:10:05,104
Oh, of course.

1731
01:10:05,106 --> 01:10:07,338
My family has been
luring vampires

1732
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,441
to their death for centuries.

1733
01:10:09,443 --> 01:10:11,276
Is that really necessary?

1734
01:10:11,278 --> 01:10:11,612
Quite.

1735
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:16,582
Am I out of blood?

1736
01:10:16,584 --> 01:10:19,217
I might be out of blood.

1737
01:10:19,219 --> 01:10:19,787
You can die now.

1738
01:10:22,255 --> 01:10:23,689
No.

1739
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:25,290
I've got a little blood left.

1740
01:10:25,292 --> 01:10:26,892
I have to bleed out first.

1741
01:10:26,894 --> 01:10:26,828
Welp.

1742
01:10:30,698 --> 01:10:32,732
It's such a skinny stake.

1743
01:10:32,734 --> 01:10:35,333
What a slow death
you've appointed me to.

1744
01:10:35,335 --> 01:10:37,837
It's been fun.

1745
01:10:37,839 --> 01:10:38,336
Yes.

1746
01:10:38,338 --> 01:10:39,471
Thank you.

1747
01:10:39,473 --> 01:10:41,406
At least you say that.

1748
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:42,141
God, compliment me while
I die, why don't you?

1749
01:10:42,143 --> 01:10:42,608
Is it 11:00 already?

1750
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:45,211
Wow.

1751
01:10:45,213 --> 01:10:48,279
[thud]

1752
01:10:48,281 --> 01:10:49,949
This is the final straw.

1753
01:10:49,951 --> 01:10:51,751
Ghosts I was OK with.

1754
01:10:51,753 --> 01:10:54,053
I even begrudgingly
accepted zombies.

1755
01:10:54,055 --> 01:10:57,056
But Kung Fu zombies and Marilyn
Monroe and now a vampire?

1756
01:10:57,058 --> 01:10:58,389
And Van Helsing.

1757
01:10:58,391 --> 01:11:00,159
Van Helsing?

1758
01:11:00,161 --> 01:11:02,128
And how many times
do you think you

1759
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,130
can shock an audience with
a supposedly dead character

1760
01:11:04,132 --> 01:11:06,031
suddenly springing up?

1761
01:11:06,033 --> 01:11:08,333
This is just bad writing.

1762
01:11:08,335 --> 01:11:11,203
This is 10 pounds of
shit in a 5 pounds bag.

1763
01:11:11,205 --> 01:11:13,438
I'm for scrapping the whole
thing and starting over.

1764
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,974
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1765
01:11:14,976 --> 01:11:16,842
You don't know a good
thing when you see it.

1766
01:11:16,844 --> 01:11:20,246
This screenplay could
be our meal ticket.

1767
01:11:20,248 --> 01:11:22,515
Oh, I see.

1768
01:11:22,517 --> 01:11:24,984
You were just pretending
to collaborate on a play.

1769
01:11:24,986 --> 01:11:28,319
This whole time, you were
writing your cheap exploitation

1770
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:29,889
film for the mindless masses.

1771
01:11:29,891 --> 01:11:32,390
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

1772
01:11:32,392 --> 01:11:33,526
I'm deleting the whole thing.

1773
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:35,027
Oh, no you are not, my friend.

1774
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:36,427
No, no.

1775
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:37,129
Do not hit that delete key.

01:11:37,799 --> 01:11:38,429
Dammit, Charlie.

1778
01:11:38,431 --> 01:11:38,800
Don't make me do this.

1779

"Damn it, Charlie.

1782
01:11:57,384 --> 01:11:57,985
Don't make me do this."

[tranquil music]

1784

[knocking]

1785
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:12,097
Knock, knock, honey.

1786
01:12:12,099 --> 01:12:13,999
I'm kind of working here.

1787
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:15,433
Oh.

1788
01:12:15,435 --> 01:12:17,069
Well, I didn't hear any typing.

1789
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:19,772
So I thought that it was OK.

1790
01:12:19,774 --> 01:12:21,974
Whether you hear me
typing or whether you

1791
01:12:21,976 --> 01:12:24,610
don't hear me typing,
whatever the fuck you hear--

1792
01:12:24,612 --> 01:12:26,411
Jack Nicholson in The Shining.

1793
01:12:26,413 --> 01:12:27,179
Very good.

1794
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:30,049
[laughing]

1795
01:12:30,051 --> 01:12:34,352
Well, at least you're not
typing "All work and no play

1796
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:38,324
make George a dull boy."

1797
01:12:38,326 --> 01:12:40,759
Yeah.

1798
01:12:40,761 --> 01:12:41,994
No.

1799
01:12:41,996 --> 01:12:43,662
Thank heaven for that.

1800
01:12:43,664 --> 01:12:46,599
How's the writing going today?

1801
01:12:46,601 --> 01:12:48,868
Well, to be honest, I've
been fighting with myself

1802
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,770
the whole day.

1803
01:12:51,772 --> 01:12:56,308
It's that old art versus
commerce argument.

1804
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:57,375
Yeah.

1805
01:12:57,377 --> 01:12:58,177
Yeah.

1806
01:12:58,179 --> 01:12:58,378
Exactly.

1807
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:03,582
Bridgette?

1808
01:13:03,584 --> 01:13:05,584
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1809
01:13:05,586 --> 01:13:07,219
Are you basing a
character on me?

1810
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:09,788
Just the name.

1811
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:12,457
So she's nothing like me?

1812
01:13:12,459 --> 01:13:14,727
Unless you're a total sociopath
with no redeeming qualities,

1813
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:15,761
then no.

1814
01:13:15,763 --> 01:13:18,097
She is nothing like you.

1815
01:13:18,099 --> 01:13:19,064
Oh, yes.

1816
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:22,134
That would be me.

1817
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:26,939
You know, honey, I was thinking.

1818
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:30,441
Maybe you should think about
getting someone, another writer

1819
01:13:30,443 --> 01:13:31,409
to work with you.

1820
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:34,546
You mean, collaborate?

1821
01:13:34,548 --> 01:13:36,048
I'm deleting the whole thing.

1822
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:36,815
Damn it, Charlie.

1823
01:13:36,817 --> 01:13:38,684
Don't make me do this.

1824
01:13:38,686 --> 01:13:41,654
I don't know if that'd
work out so well.

1825
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:44,690
But at least then you
wouldn't be, you know,

1826
01:13:44,692 --> 01:13:47,259
spending all your time cooped
up down here, all alone,

1827
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:50,229
in a room, talking to yourself.

1828
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:51,030
OK.

1829
01:13:51,032 --> 01:13:52,765
You know what?

1830
01:13:52,767 --> 01:13:54,767
I'll consider it
for my next project.

1831
01:13:54,769 --> 01:13:55,734
OK.

1832
01:13:55,736 --> 01:13:57,336
It's just a thought.

1833
01:13:57,338 --> 01:13:58,771
I mean, you know
I worry about you.

1834
01:13:58,773 --> 01:14:00,873
You don't have to
worry about me.

1835
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:03,309
Actually, I think I've really
written something good here

1836
01:14:03,311 --> 01:14:06,145
and has commercial value.

1837
01:14:06,147 --> 01:14:06,979
You've said that before.

1838
01:14:06,981 --> 01:14:07,478
I know.

1839
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,814
I know.

1840
01:14:08,816 --> 01:14:09,882
But this one is different.

1841
01:14:09,884 --> 01:14:14,019
This one has, well, everything.

1842
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:16,121
Well, I hope so.

1843
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:17,957
We could use some money.

1844
01:14:17,959 --> 01:14:21,193
I know.

1845
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:23,062
What about your dad?

1846
01:14:23,064 --> 01:14:24,596
Do you think, like,
he'd maybe loan us some

1847
01:14:24,598 --> 01:14:26,298
till I can sell this?

1848
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,465
Oh, boy.

1849
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:29,467
My father?

1850
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:30,569
You must be kidding?

1851
01:14:30,571 --> 01:14:33,305
I mean, you know what?

1852
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:34,472
I know.

1853
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:36,442
Let's steal his Picasso.

1854
01:14:36,444 --> 01:14:37,276
Oh, now, there's a thought.

1855
01:14:37,278 --> 01:14:39,678
Hmm?

1856
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,679
All right.

1857
01:14:40,681 --> 01:14:41,280
Coming to dinner?

1858
01:14:41,282 --> 01:14:42,081
Yeah.

1859
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:43,916
In a little bit.

1860
01:14:43,918 --> 01:14:46,285
I just want to put
one thing in here

1861
01:14:46,287 --> 01:14:48,587
before it falls out my ears.

1862
01:14:48,589 --> 01:14:52,591
You know, the kids would like
to see their father sometime.

1863
01:14:52,593 --> 01:14:56,428
Bridgette, my darling, love
of my life, I'll be right up.

1864
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,998
But I'll bash your brains in.

1865
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,066
I'll bash your fucking
brains right in.

1866
01:15:01,068 --> 01:15:02,034
That was good.

1867
01:15:02,036 --> 01:15:02,434
That was--

1868
01:15:02,436 --> 01:15:05,037
Thanks.

1869
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:05,671
That was good, but I don't
think you quite have it exactly.

1870
01:15:05,673 --> 01:15:06,772
All right.

1871
01:15:06,774 --> 01:15:08,674
I'll keep working on it.

1872
01:15:08,676 --> 01:15:10,676
And I got to work on this.

1873
01:15:10,678 --> 01:15:12,644
But I will be right up.

1874
01:15:12,646 --> 01:15:13,979
Tell the kids I'll be
up in time for dessert.

1875
01:15:13,981 --> 01:15:16,582
OK?

1876
01:15:16,584 --> 01:15:17,916
I just really need to get
this down before I forget it.

1877
01:15:17,918 --> 01:15:18,584
OK.

1878
01:15:18,586 --> 01:15:18,652
All right.

1879
01:15:28,195 --> 01:15:29,528
Love you.

1880
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:32,331
Love you.

1881
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:36,635
Kung Fu Zombies, the screenplay.

1882
01:15:36,637 --> 01:15:37,302
[ominous music]

1883
01:15:37,304 --> 01:15:38,570
We fade in--

1884
01:15:38,572 --> 01:15:40,139
[choking]

1885
01:15:40,141 --> 01:15:43,110
[evil laughter]

1886
01:15:47,948 --> 01:15:50,115
[typing]

1887
01:15:50,117 --> 01:15:53,087
[eerie music]

1888
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:09,601
What the hell just happened?

1889
01:16:09,603 --> 01:16:11,904
Where am?

1890
01:16:11,906 --> 01:16:15,808
What-- why does everything
seem so much smaller?

1891
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,578
Am I in a dollhouse
version of my house?

1892
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:27,019
Are those credits rolling
by outside my smaller house?

1893
01:16:27,021 --> 01:16:28,887
Whoa.

1894
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:30,222
How the hell did
you get in here?

1895
01:16:30,224 --> 01:16:31,323
All right.

1896
01:16:31,325 --> 01:16:32,991
George, George, relax.

1897
01:16:32,993 --> 01:16:33,560
I know this is a little
freaky right now.

1898
01:16:33,562 --> 01:16:34,893
Yeah.

1899
01:16:34,895 --> 01:16:35,461
This is actually a movie.

1900
01:16:35,463 --> 01:16:35,629
What?

1901
01:16:39,568 --> 01:16:42,067
I was writing a movie.

1902
01:16:42,069 --> 01:16:42,801
I know that.

1903
01:16:42,803 --> 01:16:45,104
Not exactly.

1904
01:16:45,106 --> 01:16:48,173
You're actually a character
in a movie I directed.

1905
01:16:48,175 --> 01:16:48,707
Hold on.

1906
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:50,142
Hold on.

1907
01:16:50,144 --> 01:16:51,544
Explain to me what's going on.

1908
01:16:51,546 --> 01:16:53,712
Guys.

1909
01:16:53,714 --> 01:16:54,046
Guys, guys, kill the
credits for a second.

1910
01:16:54,048 --> 01:16:54,446
Oh.

1911
01:16:54,448 --> 01:16:55,280
Thank you.

1912
01:16:55,282 --> 01:16:56,048
That's very unsettling.

1913
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:56,682
Oh.

1914
01:16:56,684 --> 01:16:57,282
Thank you.

1915
01:16:57,284 --> 01:16:58,050
Thank you.

1916
01:16:58,052 --> 01:16:58,951
Thank you.

1917
01:16:58,953 --> 01:16:59,251
That was so unsettling.

1918
01:16:59,253 --> 01:16:59,751
Yeah.

1919
01:16:59,753 --> 01:17:02,522
Yeah.

1920
01:17:02,524 --> 01:17:02,855
You should feel like you got
a little bit more breathing

1921
01:17:02,857 --> 01:17:03,255
room, a normal size again.

1922
01:17:03,257 --> 01:17:04,456
Yeah, yeah.

1923
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:06,325
So what's going on?

1924
01:17:06,327 --> 01:17:08,260
OK.

1925
01:17:08,262 --> 01:17:10,062
So like I was saying,
you're actually

1926
01:17:10,064 --> 01:17:12,831
a character that was written
by my father for a play

1927
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:16,168
that he created and then
I turned into a movie.

1928
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:19,104
You're played by an actor
named Maurice LeMarche.

1929
01:17:19,106 --> 01:17:21,306
I'm not familiar with his work.

1930
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:22,941
Voice actor?

1931
01:17:22,943 --> 01:17:23,842
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1932
01:17:23,844 --> 01:17:24,443
Pinky and the Brain.

1933
01:17:24,445 --> 01:17:25,744
Yeah, yeah.

1934
01:17:25,746 --> 01:17:26,011
He was a friend of my father's.

1935
01:17:26,013 --> 01:17:26,546
Oh.

1936
01:17:26,548 --> 01:17:27,547
Yeah.

1937
01:17:27,549 --> 01:17:28,213
Your dad wrote on that?

1938
01:17:28,215 --> 01:17:28,881
Yeah, yeah.

1939
01:17:28,883 --> 01:17:30,682
Yes, yes, yes.

1940
01:17:30,684 --> 01:17:32,519
I liked his episodes
particularly.

1941
01:17:32,521 --> 01:17:37,590
So you're saying then that
I, George the screenwriter

1942
01:17:37,592 --> 01:17:40,192
and playwright, am not real.

1943
01:17:40,194 --> 01:17:41,894
Well, I mean, are any of us?

1944
01:17:41,896 --> 01:17:43,729
I'm actually not
really the director.

1945
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:46,131
I'm a character
named "The Director"

1946
01:17:46,133 --> 01:17:48,167
that the director is actually
playing inside of his own movie

1947
01:17:48,169 --> 01:17:49,835
that was written as a play.

1948
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:52,237
I mean, I was
almost really recast

1949
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:53,573
because I couldn't
learn my lines.

1950
01:17:53,575 --> 01:17:55,508
Wow.

1951
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:56,576
That's got to be a comedown.

1952
01:17:56,578 --> 01:17:57,809
I know.

1953
01:17:57,811 --> 01:17:59,945
I really feel for the actor.

1954
01:17:59,947 --> 01:18:02,748
So are you telling me
I'm just words on a page?

1955
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:05,117
Words on a page.

1956
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:10,389
So when the movie ends,
do I just disappear

1957
01:18:10,391 --> 01:18:12,457
and I'm gone for good?

1958
01:18:12,459 --> 01:18:13,292
No.

1959
01:18:13,294 --> 01:18:14,459
No.

1960
01:18:14,461 --> 01:18:15,628
I'm not saying that.

1961
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:18,730
Some works, they last forever.

1962
01:18:18,732 --> 01:18:19,033
Nothing's ever
really gone for good.

1963
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:23,302
All right.

1964
01:18:23,304 --> 01:18:24,169
Cut.

1965
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:24,703
Cut it.

1966
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:24,872
Cut.

1967
01:18:31,212 --> 01:18:34,014
[frantic music]
