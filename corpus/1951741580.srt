1
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,549
Thanks.

2
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,867
Here.

3
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:48,913
Sorry.

4
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:59,849
- That was quick.
- I sat next to the wrong person.

5
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,090
- Really? Where?
- Don't look! Don't look!

6
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,961
Careful of my jacket.

7
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,663
Will the wedding be crowded?

8
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,704
I don't know.

9
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,505
I don't think
she knows anyone anymore.

10
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,113
She's only known this guy a year.

11
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:58,909
Is that short?

12
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,484
Would you marry someone
you'd only known a year?

13
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,321
I can't say I have a lot of hope
for the whole thing.

14
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,784
Then why are we going then?

15
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:13,432
- We're supporting her.
- I thought she wasn't speaking to you.

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,965
No.

17
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,963
I wasn't speaking to her, but I'm over it.

18
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,703
I'm never getting married.

19
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,337
Why aren't you wearing
your new shades?

20
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,564
I don't think I need them right now.

21
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,706
You begged for those glasses.

22
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,719
You look very cool.

23
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,315
I don't need them right now.

24
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,599
Do they know we're here?

25
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,527
Yes.

26
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,108
Are you...

27
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,055
Paul apologizes for not coming.
She's still getting the house ready.

28
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,457
I'm sorry it was such short notice.

29
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,621
I don't care.
Paul's frantic, but I don't give a shit.

30
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,398
And Ingrid wants me to tell you
that she made us all bracelets.

31
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,798
No, I said we should wait.

32
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,636
I thought you asked me to tell them.
Anyway, I got Knicks colors.

33
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,174
They're not Knicks colors!

34
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,903
It's beautiful, Ingrid.

35
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,039
- Where's your dad and Josh?
- They might come later.

36
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,708
Josh's spring break is next week,
and then Jim teaches through Friday.

37
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,184
Then he opens the house
in Vermont on the weekend.

38
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,714
It means a lot to Pauline that you came.

39
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,246
Good.

40
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,019
Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack!

41
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,485
God!

42
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,901
If you're wondering about
the mustache...

43
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:29,991
No, I wasn't.

44
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,537
I had a full beard for a while,
and then when I shaved it

45
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,166
I left this part for last, you know,
to see how it looked.

46
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:37,710
And...

47
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,704
It's meant to be funny.

48
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,849
You're so handsome.

49
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,262
I never thought I'd get you here.

50
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,131
You're arriving in the midst of a drama.

51
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,642
Ingrid, would you make sure
Wizard's inside?

52
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:12,768
It's the Voglers.

53
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,143
The neighbours want us
to cut down our tree.

54
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,148
No. That's our tree.

55
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,445
They think it's sick
and rotting their property.

56
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,019
We're having the ceremony under it.

57
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,610
You took the swing down.

58
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,953
Pauline thinks this is their way
of trying to be friends.

59
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,760
I think they resent us because we're...

60
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,558
I don't know what we are.

61
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,638
- This is my room.
- Okay.

62
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,204
- Do you like showers or baths?
- Showers. What about you?

63
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,372
I don't care.

64
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,006
Is Malcolm what you thought he'd be?

65
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,111
- I didn't know what to...
- The mustache is temporary.

66
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,983
He saved it for last
when he was shaving.

67
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,386
It's meant to be funny.

68
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,718
- He told me.
- Yeah.

69
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,186
I'm sorry, with so little time to prepare,

70
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,762
we had to put you in
Malcolm's storage room.

71
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,491
This was Becky's room. Poor Becky.

72
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,192
Poor Becky.
Well, now it's a storage room.

73
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,468
I've just started to feel like it's
our house and not my parents', you know.

74
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,734
Our parents.

75
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,537
Of course.

76
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,702
Sorry, it might still smell like paint.

77
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,336
I thought he was a musician.

78
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,678
Well, music's officially a hobby.
He's painting now,

79
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,514
and writing letters to newspapers
and magazines.

80
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,046
He's very meticulous.

81
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,124
He'll spend up to a week
writing a response to a music review.

82
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:37,588
He's incredibly smart. Maybe too smart.
I don't know. We're doing very well.

83
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,164
Good. I mean, you must be.

84
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,227
I don't know where to begin.
What can I tell you?

85
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,139
It seems I'm pregnant,
but it's really early,

86
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,712
so I haven't told anyone.
I mean, I haven't told Malcolm or Ingrid.

87
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,178
- Wow.
- What did you say?

88
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,270
I said wow.

89
00:06:56,382 --> 00:07:00,478
Yeah. If it sticks. We'll see. I hope so.

90
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,213
Things are good.

91
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,984
We did a couples' seminar
two months ago or so in Maine.

92
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,787
They give you exercises
and things to do.

93
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,352
I know you're not convinced,
but we got engaged right afterwards.

94
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,892
The guy who runs it, Strickland,
he wrote this really interesting book,

95
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,969
<i>On Loving,
which I'll lend you if you want.</i>

96
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,036
Okay.

97
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,399
But only if you'll read it.

98
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,564
Because I need it back.
I made notes in the margins.

99
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,436
I may not get to it for a while.

100
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,068
Well, I'm not going to lend it to you
if you're not going to read it.

101
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,704
It's gonna be very informal, by the way.

102
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,340
Just Mom and Becky,
Malcolm's brother,

103
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,943
a few friends, and now you and Claude.
Nothing like the first one.

104
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,282
Becky's coming?

105
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,151
- Yeah.
- Could I have some...

106
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,625
You go.

107
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,817
I was just going to say
could I have some white wine?

108
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,896
Oh, yeah. We have...

109
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,527
I'm really glad you changed your mind
and came.

110
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,265
I never heard from you after I sent
the invite. I even wondered if you got it.

111
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,930
I'm just so pleased that we're here.

112
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,141
Did you get it?

113
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,800
Yeah.

114
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,275
I'm sorry you were so angry.

115
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,642
I wasn't angry. I was disappointed.

116
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,578
But you see,
when you say disappointed,

117
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,708
it puts me in a crummy situation,
like I let you down.

118
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,116
- Well, you did, in a way.
- No, I don't see it like that.

119
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,779
Fine. I felt betrayed. Is that word okay?

120
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,186
Again, you're making me the aggressor.

121
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,349
You were the aggressor.

122
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,086
Listen, let's not...

123
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,394
I've become a really good cook.

124
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,940
I can't believe you've still got
all of our old records.

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,100
- Mom, can you hide this, please?
- Yeah, of course.

126
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,337
Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek once.

127
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,346
Yeah, in the late '80s.

128
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,315
After he left The Cars. It was a solo gig.

129
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,884
So you're kind of famous?

130
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:44,514
No, no, believe me, I'm not.
I used to want to be, but no.

131
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,613
Do you want to be famous?

132
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,750
Claude wants to be very famous.

133
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,829
Well, make sure you can
handle rejection. I can't.

134
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,660
For me, expectation just
turns to disappointment.

135
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,758
So ultimately, I'd rather not try.

136
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,263
Claude, ignore him.

137
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,071
It'll all go black for us
soon enough, anyway.

138
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,468
When your mother moved to New York,

139
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,510
she used to send me
books and records.

140
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,704
<i>- She sent me R.E.M.'s Murmur.
- And the Pixies.</i>

141
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:11,681
And X. She was very cool, your mother.

142
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,980
- You only liked Top 40.
- That's true. But I love R.E.M. Now.

143
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,021
I don't really listen to music anymore.

144
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,254
I was dating that guy Horace back then.
Do you remember him?

145
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,995
Was that the guy
that liked to rough you up?

146
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,895
No, that was our dad.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,265
Our dad used to strip down to
his skiwies and beat us with a belt.

148
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,201
That man had a sexual screw loose.

149
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,433
That's awful that stuff
that happens to kids.

150
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,805
Malcolm was fondled
by a male babysitter.

151
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,003
Just use that information
however you want.

152
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,580
I'm sorry, we're with family. I figured...

153
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,782
I think Becky got it the worst.

154
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,514
Did she ever.
Raped by the horse trainer.

155
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,561
Alan rolled over in bed and he looked
at me and he said, "I can't feel my face. "

156
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,933
It took three doctors before
we knew it was Bell's Palsy.

157
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,599
They say a brush of wind can do it.

158
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,269
Feeling is slowly coming back.

159
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,481
We're all getting older, which is terrible.

160
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:20,541
I don't care how universal it is.
I can't remember names anymore.

161
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,487
I have that.
I blank out on certain words now, too.

162
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,855
The other day I couldn't remember
the word for...

163
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:33,262
I've forgotten it again. The stuff in wine.
What is it? Sediment. That's it.

164
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,560
I know that. I was talking more about

165
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,227
not remembering who was
the bassist for Mötley Crüe.

166
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,339
Ingrid. Why don't you show Claude
and Bruce the game trunk?

167
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,406
Okay.

168
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,906
Mick Mars.

169
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,811
Toby, I think you need to have
Bruce diagnosed.

170
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,314
Margot, I don't wanna have
this conversation with you.

171
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,949
It's vital. If you keep telling him
he's like everyone else,

172
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,893
he's gonna wonder why he isn't.
He's suffering.

173
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,022
He's tested very well.
He does B's in school.

174
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,691
But that's how autism works.

175
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,634
One part of the brain can be fine,
and then the other part is damaged.

176
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,865
We've had him diagnosed, Margot.
Nothing was found wrong.

177
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,703
Did you really, though?

178
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,735
I'm not gonna have this conversation.
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,315
I know this must be so difficult for you,
but you have to...

180
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,278
<i>What are you doing?</i>

181
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,980
I left you a note.

182
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,216
<i>Come back.</i>

183
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,651
<i>Or meet me in Vermont on Saturday.</i>

184
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,925
No. No. The wedding is on Saturday.

185
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,058
I'm here for that. I can't pull out.
How would that look?

186
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,571
<i>You haven't spoken to her in years.</i>

187
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:51,371
Well, we're speaking now.
She is my closest friend, despite it all.

188
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,570
You were the one that kept trying
to get me to call her.

189
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,476
<i>Did you tell Claude what you're doing?</i>

190
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,441
Jim, this guy, Malcolm,

191
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,413
he's exactly what you'd imagine,
except I think he's clinically depressed.

192
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:11,462
He's not ugly.
He's just completely unattractive.

193
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,555
He has no job.

194
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,760
Best I can make out is
he's a letter writer. I don't know.

195
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,032
And the house looks weird to me.
She's trying too hard.

196
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,736
It's all kind of a mess.

197
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,569
They took down the swing.

198
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:30,537
Hello?

199
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,176
<i>You said you weren't 100% on this.
You said that like a week ago.</i>

200
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,487
<i>Can I come up there?</i>

201
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,615
No. I don't want to see you.
I feel happier already having done it.

202
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,328
<i>Please, don't tell Claude anything,
please, until we've talked more.</i>

203
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,421
This is happening, and you need
to get your mind around that.

204
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,227
- Are you asleep?
- Yes.

205
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,300
- Will you remember this?
- Yeah.

206
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,739
I just talked to your dad.

207
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,382
I'm only going to tell you
if you won't remember.

208
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,245
Okay.

209
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,919
Everyone finds you so funny
and charming.

210
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,223
I always get compliments about you.

211
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,423
Are you having fun?
Is it nice to see Pauline?

212
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,597
- Yeah, I really like her.
- Yeah, she is crazy, though.

213
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,903
- In what way?
- She's really berserk.

214
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,411
Maybe it's the hormones.

215
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,614
You didn't notice anything
different about Pauline?

216
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,342
- No.
- She's pregnant. She told me.

217
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,786
She's keeping it a secret
from Malcolm and even Ingrid,

218
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,222
which I think is unforgivable.

219
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,757
Now she's gonna have to marry him.

220
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,764
What's she planning on doing,
getting married

221
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:56,198
and not drinking champagne?
Then she's just gonna be lying.

222
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,037
I guess she's afraid she'll miscarry.
She probably will.

223
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,531
I think on some level,
she's ambivalent about the marriage.

224
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,370
That's why she's not telling him.

225
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,040
Are you stoned, Mom?

226
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,307
Maybe a little.

227
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,849
I don't like it.

228
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,518
My scrotum is longer than my penis.

229
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,722
It's sweet how Claude looks up to me.

230
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,493
Margot doesn't seem as crazy
as you made her out to be.

231
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,802
What she did to Alan and Toby tonight
didn't seem crazy enough for you?

232
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,609
I guess that seemed pretty crazy.

233
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,235
Well, she cares deeply.

234
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,712
Yeah, she's really worried about Bruce.

235
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:47,211
This has nothing to do with Bruce.
She thinks everyone is autistic.

236
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,844
What?

237
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,480
Nothing.
You keep changing your position.

238
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,718
I'm just trying to figure out
if I should agree with you or not.

239
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,318
Well, can't she be both?
Care deeply and be crazy?

240
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,556
I mean, do people have to be
all one thing?

241
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,960
- I guess not.
- Well, okay then.

242
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,962
It is nice she came for the wedding.

243
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,039
She's so pretty, don't you think?

244
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:12,371
- She's attractive.
- A little thin, maybe.

245
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,179
But it is nice she came.

246
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,713
Let's fuck.

247
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,175
Fuck it!

248
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,240
Claude!

249
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,877
<i>I knew I could be friends with him</i>

250
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,854
Good go.

251
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,217
Honey, you're up.

252
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:12,294
Claude, don't just whack it.
Think about it before you hit.

253
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,130
Sorry.

254
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,033
Good.

255
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,044
Paul, what are you doing?

256
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,338
I'm sending Claude's ball
into the bushes.

257
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,413
Take the extra hit.

258
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,481
- I don't want to do that.
- It's the smarter play.

259
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,810
Pauline! I told you, you can't!
Your feet are too small.

260
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,878
You took the awnings down.

261
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:40,954
Yes!

262
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,595
Okay.

263
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,743
- Well done.
- Fuck you.

264
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,219
Come on, Claude.

265
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,029
Honey, you're going the wrong way.

266
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,003
So stupid.

267
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,403
Mom, I'm sorry. Jesus.

268
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,679
This is why I hate games.
I hate what it does to me.

269
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,407
Wait! We're not finished yet!

270
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,077
Malcolm?

271
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,754
Have you ever noticed how Pauline
sometimes can't make eye contact?

272
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,490
How her gaze hovers
just above your head?

273
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,495
I think I know what you mean.

274
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,898
I always think
that I have something in my hair.

275
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:55,369
It's not necessarily bad, Paul.
It's just something that you do.

276
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:02,210
Claude, have you ever seen
your mother climb a tree?

277
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:03,703
No.

278
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,841
We don't have much opportunity
in Manhattan.

279
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,047
As kids, Margot climbed everything.

280
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,644
She could even climb that tree.

281
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,280
Can you do it, Mom?

282
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,893
- Maybe later.
- No, now.

283
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,394
- Do it now, Margot.
- Show him, Margot.

284
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,458
I told you.

285
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,774
Shit.

286
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,614
What's she doing now?

287
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,221
She's stuck.

288
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,659
You okay?

289
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,159
I got it.

290
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,309
You were great on the way up.

291
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,707
- Don't patronize me, Claude.
- Come on, we're all laughing, Margot!

292
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,183
You're laughing in a kind way.

293
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,015
Claude is taking
too much pleasure out of it.

294
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,748
- I am not.
- You are.

295
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:01,292
You like to make fun of me,
to see me get embarrassed.

296
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,553
It's mean.

297
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,559
- What are you doing?
- I've got a fucking bug in my ear, okay?

298
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,169
I thought Claude could hand out
programs. Ingrid wants to sing.

299
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,202
Do you want to read a poem
or something?

300
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,799
You know I don't like
to speak in front of people.

301
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,972
I'm doing this conversation
at the bookstore in town on Friday.

302
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,447
I totally regret having said I'd do it.

303
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,546
You're doing a conversation?

304
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,212
Yeah. Just talking about my work
in front of a crowd.

305
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,553
I would have invited you,
but I thought it'd be boring.

306
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,394
What? Say it.

307
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,098
Nothing. It's just, I would come.
I wanna come.

308
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,427
I get a kick out of it.

309
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:46,994
Just, it's weird, you know.
So you're not here for my...

310
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:52,339
It's okay. I get it.
When did they ask you?

311
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,945
A while ago. I said no, but then
when I was coming here anyway,

312
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,210
I guess it helps sales. And so...

313
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,813
I see.

314
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,514
Did I tell you Becky got her tubes tied?

315
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:12,056
Why? Is she seeing someone?
She's still obese, I assume.

316
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,597
I think it's symbolic.

317
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,428
I bet Mom paid for it.

318
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,264
- We should audit Mom.
- I considered it in my 20s.

319
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,100
You know, when I was fucking everyone.
You remember?

320
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,369
- I did my share.
- Not like me.

321
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,374
You wanna count?

322
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,344
No, Margot. I don't wanna count.

323
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,484
What was it about Dad
that had us fucking so many guys?

324
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,713
I think it was the only time
we could really feel unselfconscious

325
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,256
and get out of our heads.

326
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,186
I don't think it was that.

327
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,227
I just think it was something
we were good at.

328
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,228
Your mom thinks Bruce is gay.

329
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,993
No, she said he had Asperger's.
It's like lesser-retarded.

330
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,701
- I have adult A.D.D.
- You mean child A.D.D.

331
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,399
No. For some reason
I have the adult version.

332
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,736
Maybe I'm retarded.

333
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,504
- Come on!
- Come on!

334
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,239
- Hey! Be careful!
- What?

335
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,212
Be careful how you pull on
that child's arm.

336
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,613
You'll take it out of its socket.

337
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,742
Don't tell us how to treat our child.

338
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:10,481
I don't care how you treat your child.
Just don't hurt him.

339
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,819
- It's a girl.
- She threw a rock at me.

340
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,183
She's a little girl.

341
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,819
She knew what she was doing.
There's no hitting in our family.

342
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,191
Do you understand?

343
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,456
Stay out of it, bitch.

344
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,634
That was the Voglers.

345
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,799
Jesus, Margot, what are you doing?
They already hate us.

346
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,873
Don't you tell me what I can
and can't do. That is child abuse.

347
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,441
Mom, she was psychotic.

348
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,635
Stop picking on me, everyone.

349
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,448
Oh, God.

350
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:48,887
It could be anyone's.

351
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:52,863
What are they gonna do to us?

352
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,488
They're not going to do anything, honey.

353
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,092
We have to cut down the tree.

354
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,499
You should have seen
that woman's face.

355
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,968
Margot completely set her off.

356
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,868
Where are we gonna get married then?

357
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,399
We'll get married
in the fucking driveway if we have to.

358
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,136
Your mom started a war.

359
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,211
We have to make sure we wear shoes,

360
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,247
because they might
start throwing glass.

361
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:15,146
- Has that happened before?
- I can't remember. I think so.

362
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,788
No, it definitely has. Now I remember.

363
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,452
- Where you going?
- To town. I'll be back for dinner.

364
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,464
Come on, Margot, nobody blames you.

365
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:37,704
- Is that Dick Koosman?
- Yeah. He has a house up here.

366
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,605
- What's he doing with Mom?
- Good question.

367
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,648
Dick and his daughter asked us over
to swim tomorrow.

368
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,913
We didn't invite them to the wedding.

369
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,852
You're not really friends.

370
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:58,089
We're friends enough that it's awkward.
Maisy baby-sits for us all the time.

371
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,528
He's doing the interview with me
in town on Friday.

372
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,362
Did I tell you he and I are collaborating
on a screenplay?

373
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,433
An adaptation of one of Dick's novels.

374
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,835
No, I didn't even know you knew
he was up here.

375
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,806
Is he even a good writer?
Why do people care about him?

376
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,069
You're competitive with everyone.

377
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,475
It doesn't even matter
if they do the same thing as you.

378
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,308
He's competitive with Bono.

379
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,279
It's true. I don't subscribe to the credo

380
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,817
that there's enough room
for everyone to be successful.

381
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,443
I think there are only
a few spots available,

382
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,216
and people like Dick Koosman
and Bono are taking them up.

383
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,615
Malcolm, what would ever make
you think that's something

384
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,159
to draw right now?

385
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:30,984
Sorry.

386
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,325
I wasn't thinking about it. Sorry, Margot.

387
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,461
You found it.

388
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,560
- Hi!
- Hey, Maisy.

389
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,002
Thank you, Pauline.

390
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,010
- Hi.
- How are you?

391
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,674
- What's up?
- I don't wanna do this.

392
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,942
- Come on, don't be that way.
- No, I'm not being that way.

393
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,813
I just don't feel like it.

394
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:58,084
I'm gonna go back and...
I have work to do.

395
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,747
Dick doesn't care
that you don't make any money.

396
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,418
Is that what you... That's not why.

397
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:05,894
I just hate swimming. I really hate it.
It's disgusting to me.

398
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,056
My mistake was saying
I would do it to begin with.

399
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,360
You have fun.

400
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,301
Fine. We'll have fun.

401
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,807
People always pee in the pool.

402
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,774
I don't think Dick and Maisy pee
in their pool.

403
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,073
I'll bet you $500 there's pee in that pool.

404
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,471
To the end and back.
Claude, you say go.

405
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,448
Okay. Go!

406
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,383
- How's your dad?
- Good.

407
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,322
He and I shared a thesis advisor
at Stanford. Did you know that?

408
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,415
No.

409
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,129
I was dating your mom back then.
Did you know that?

410
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,218
No.

411
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,542
- Pauline wins! Mom cheated.
- I did not.

412
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,440
You didn't touch the wall, Margot.

413
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,708
It doesn't matter. Lost anyway.

414
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,146
It was close.

415
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,316
Maisy, aren't you going swimming?

416
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:47,792
Claude!

417
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,970
Are you okay?

418
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,070
I got him!

419
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,077
It's okay, baby.

420
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,690
- I'm sorry I laughed about the tree.
- Now we're even.

421
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,100
- You've got a problem.
- What do you mean?

422
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,727
I don't like the girl,

423
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,861
and I don't like the way
Malcolm looks at her.

424
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,097
Come on, it's sexy.

425
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,640
No, you didn't see it.
I saw it. You've got a problem.

426
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,437
I'm not worried.

427
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,543
Maybe teach Claude how to swim.

428
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,941
He won't want to do it. It's too late.

429
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,848
- Are you supposed to be doing that?
- No.

430
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,859
<i>I liked your last story. Was it Harper's?
The one about Mom.</i>

431
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,121
I was very... I liked it very much.

432
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,725
- It wasn't really about Mom.
- I thought it was.

433
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,432
Anyway. Why don't you want
Claude to know how to swim?

434
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:02,768
I didn't say I didn't want him to.
Why do you care?

435
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,239
It's not in his life. We're New Yorkers.

436
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,503
If he wants to learn when he's older,
he can.

437
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:09,036
I'm curious why you're so
interested in the whole thing.

438
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:13,550
I'm not. It's just as a safety thing.
Forget it.

439
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,744
It's interesting.

440
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,255
This is the first time
Dick has invited us over.

441
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,088
Are you really friends?

442
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,319
Well, we're neighbours.
We employ Maisy.

443
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,896
I mean, I don't care.
I just think it's interesting.

444
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,734
Are you excited about the talk?
I'd like to come, if it's okay.

445
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:35,538
My friend Blair asked me, "What's it like
to have a celebrity as a sister?"

446
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,608
I said I've got no problem with celebrity.

447
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,177
Alice Munro spoke at Bennington
and was sort of a friend of mine.

448
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,444
- I'm not a celebrity.
- Well, you're well-known.

449
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,745
- To a very few people.
- Just accept the compliment.

450
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,312
I guess I didn't realize
it was a compliment.

451
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:21,976
<i>I know a girl from a lonely street</i>

452
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,243
<i>Cold as ice cream, but still as sweet</i>

453
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,717
<i>Dry your eyes, Sunday girl</i>

454
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,847
<i>Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl</i>

455
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,687
<i>Looks like he's in another world</i>

456
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,858
<i>Go on and hide, Sunday girl</i>

457
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:40,825
<i>She can't catch up</i>

458
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,160
Singing?

459
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,430
A bit.

460
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,332
Can I make a suggestion?

461
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:55,441
You should get underarm deodorant.
You kind of smell.

462
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,811
Better I tell you than someone else.

463
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:06,580
- I think you smell nice. You smell real.
- I stink.

464
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,292
- It causes cancer.
- Underarm deodorant?

465
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:16,333
It's got chemicals and other things
which are extremely harmful.

466
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,999
I'm not gonna die
from underarm cancer.

467
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,402
No, you'll get it somewhere else,
like your stomach or your testicles.

468
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:26,602
- Testicles?
- Don't laugh. It's a serious thing.

469
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,842
Who told you about this anyway?

470
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,274
- Maisy?
- Yeah.

471
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:39,252
I hope you're not interested in that girl.
I find her insufferable.

472
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:40,683
What does that mean?

473
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,727
It means I can't suffer her.
She's loud and stupid.

474
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,797
And she goes on about things
of which she knows nothing about.

475
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,525
She got into Harvard early.

476
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,124
Stupid people get into Harvard early
all the time.

477
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,338
- Where did you go again?
- Barnard.

478
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,936
I just don't think
you should do anything with her.

479
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,273
We're just friends.

480
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:06,474
If you do, use a condom.

481
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:07,710
Where are you going?

482
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,754
Out with Pauline and Malcolm and Dick.

483
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,723
Are kids coming?

484
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,125
Who do we know is gay?

485
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,223
How do I know
what gay people you know?

486
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:27,464
- Alan and Toby.
- And Bruce. He's gay and Asperger's.

487
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:31,201
- I don't know if Bruce is gay.
- He might be. It's very common.

488
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:35,307
- Your mom's pregnant.
- No, she isn't.

489
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,712
- She is.
- How do you know that, Claude?

490
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,716
She told my mom. But you can tell.
She's hormonally weird.

491
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,518
Holy shit, Ingrid.

492
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,884
You're gonna have
a baby sister or brother.

493
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,656
My mom thinks your mom is unreliable.

494
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,654
Who cares?

495
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,958
- Do you think your mom is fuckable?
- I don't know.

496
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,398
I think she's hot, your mother.
I'd do her if I was gay.

497
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,995
I might anyway,
I mean, if she came on to me.

498
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,401
She won't.

499
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,734
I'm not gonna do anyone.

500
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,709
- What was that?
- This is scary.

501
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,446
Margot used to never speak.

502
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,107
I remember we went on a double date
in high school.

503
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,684
And that kid Ron asked
if English was your first language.

504
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:51,243
It's true. I used to think
I had some kind of brain defect.

505
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:54,188
- You thought you were aphasic.
- I'm still not sure.

506
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,783
- Jesus, Margot.
- It's very possible, Paul.

507
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,863
It's just, your diagnoses sometimes irk
the hell out of me.

508
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,831
- Malcolm, will you slow down?
- What?

509
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,492
I can drive, if you like.

510
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,366
Nah. You got the dinner.
The driving's on me.

511
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,236
Well, I'll let you pay your half
if you slow down.

512
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,105
Well, neither Pauline nor I
ordered dessert.

513
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,042
Let it go, Malcolm.

514
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,637
Margot would insist on driving,
if she knew how.

515
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,974
My license elapsed, but I know how.

516
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:24,487
It's probably for the best.
I have this theory. I think, historically,

517
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,285
women have been held back in so many
ways that when they get power

518
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,360
like they do behind the wheel,
they can't help but abuse it.

519
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,490
It's akin to Hannah Arendt's
Eichmann theory about

520
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,691
prison guards and prisoners
switching roles.

521
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,629
- That's a charming philosophy.
- Yeah, tell that one a lot.

522
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,433
This isn't a blanket thing.
I mean, women can be great drivers too.

523
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,668
Said the man with the mustache
he thinks he's wearing in quotes.

524
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,105
It's meant to be funny.

525
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,573
Are you doing this for her benefit
or for mine?

526
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,577
- What the fuck?
- What?

527
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:58,621
No, there they go. It's okay. I thought
I lost the brakes for a second there.

528
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,551
- Malcolm!
- What?

529
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,218
- Watch it!
- It's fine, Margot!

530
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:04,960
You're just so incompetent.

531
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:08,395
Okay. Why don't you fucking
drive yourselves home?

532
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,293
God.

533
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,974
You should go after her.

534
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,684
Come home with me tonight.

535
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:35,984
- I've got Claude.
- Come on.

536
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,658
I've been trying to get you
up here all year.

537
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,528
She's pregnant.

538
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,911
- Why are you putting that there?
- I just wanna keep it.

539
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,315
I left a piece of skin
in a movie theater once.

540
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,484
So it could watch movies all its life.

541
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:14,055
- Are you obsessed with Maisy?
- No.

542
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,395
You're always staring at her tits.

543
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:24,574
- You have a mustache.
- My mom bleaches it.

544
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,049
- Where are you going?
- You're starting to annoy me.

545
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,781
What are you doing?

546
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:12,113
- I didn't think you came home.
- Where would I be?

547
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,550
Can't Josh and Dad come
to the wedding?

548
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,427
I've been through this. Go to bed.

549
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,696
Can I sleep in here?

550
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,663
No, honey.

551
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,029
We can put a pillow between us.

552
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:30,204
Okay. Just for tonight.

553
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:01,432
When you were a baby,
I wouldn't let anyone else hold you.

554
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,666
I think that may have been a mistake.

555
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,208
Why was it a secret?

556
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,006
Because I didn't want you to get excited
before it was real.

557
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,708
It's not really a baby yet.

558
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,546
In two weeks
we can celebrate together, okay?

559
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,347
Why did you tell Margot?

560
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,485
Because she's my sister and I trust her.

561
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,318
How do you feel about it?

562
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,517
I don't want a sister.

563
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,596
I'm gonna get Wizard.

564
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,704
Margot told Claude something
I expressly told her in confidence.

565
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,296
And he told Ingrid.

566
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:40,377
I'm stunned that she put me in this
position. It's so fucking infuriating!

567
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,038
- Well, it's one of those things...
- Don't say anything, okay?

568
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:46,173
You know what?
Just be there for me silently.

569
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,272
Okay.

570
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,349
Why do I have to be
so careful around her,

571
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,683
but everyone is allowed
to make fun of me?

572
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:55,020
- I don't think...
- Malcolm, what did I just say?

573
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,889
I just need you to take my side.
I don't need you to make it better.

574
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,828
Ingrid's really upset.

575
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:08,094
Fuck! I can't believe
she put me in this position.

576
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,634
I didn't tell you before because

577
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,074
I didn't want you to feel like
you had to marry me.

578
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:19,172
I found out right before our seminar
that I'm pregnant.

579
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,422
Well? Does that sound good to you?

580
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,715
I'm still digesting Margot telling Claude.
What a fucking nut job.

581
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:33,125
Sorry. I think I'm really happy.

582
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,701
Ingrid! Come here, honey.

583
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,917
- Hey.
- Hey.

584
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,327
I'm just looking at Pauline's
incense and self-help books.

585
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,725
I don't understand it.

586
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,457
This junk makes her look stupid,
and she's not.

587
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,565
I don't like to think of her this way.

588
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,499
She is such a hypocrite.

589
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,197
Somehow, I'm a kook
for going to therapy,

590
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:52,798
yet she's got enough drugs here
to medicate an elephant.

591
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,574
- She's always with these losers.
- Malcolm's not a loser.

592
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,342
- Claude, think about it.
- He's cool.

593
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,042
What makes you think he's cool?

594
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:05,181
I'm more talking about her investment
in things like cults and ashrams.

595
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,087
- She was in a cult?
- Years ago.

596
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:13,423
She and Lenny also followed some guru
who was a follower of the Muktananda.

597
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,529
He made her drink his bath water.

598
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,269
Who knows what she's doing now.

599
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,102
Margot? Claude?

600
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,565
- Wizard!
- Wizard!

601
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:24,641
Wizard!

602
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,108
- How long has he been gone?
- I don't know.

603
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,839
Ingrid brought him in last night,
but we couldn't find him this morning.

604
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,380
- Oh, boy.
- Wizard!

605
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,109
Did you tell Claude I'm pregnant?

606
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,715
- I don't know.
- You did.

607
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:39,214
- Well, I guess I said something.
- You did.

608
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,847
You don't have to tell him everything.

609
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,825
He wants to know.
If I don't tell him, he figures it out.

610
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,259
Mom, where's Wizard?

611
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,057
I don't know, honey.

612
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,029
You didn't let him out
into the road or something

613
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,600
where something could have
happened to him?

614
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:54,262
Why would you think that's
something I would do? That's awful.

615
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:57,863
I didn't mean on purpose. I just meant
maybe in case you knew something.

616
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:05,878
- Sorry. I'm here.
- I didn't see you.

617
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,245
I'm just writing my vows.

618
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,649
Trying to do something appropriate,
but also funny.

619
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,552
Not jokey, more character-based humor.

620
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:15,657
You having an okay time?

621
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:19,057
Yeah, besides Wizard getting out.

622
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,631
Yeah. We'll find him.

623
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,760
Or else, I don't know.

624
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:24,993
- We won't.
- Right.

625
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,899
Or else, he's dead or something.

626
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,131
- It means a lot to Paul that you came.
- Yeah.

627
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,873
That is the same toaster
we had here as kids.

628
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,282
Paul is so weird.

629
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,755
I hear you've heard the news.

630
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,987
Yeah. Congratulations.

631
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:54,087
Pretty cool. Hard to fully take in.
It's still a little abstract.

632
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:56,188
I haven't had that thing yet
where you realize

633
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,064
that you're not the most important
person in the world.

634
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,673
I'm anxious for that to happen.

635
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:08,175
I guess I have to thank you.
I wouldn't know yet if you hadn't arrived.

636
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,475
You're welcome.

637
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:15,814
Of course I can't help but worry I'll pass
not-so-great genes on to the kid.

638
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:18,183
I mean, in my family
there's a lot of hand washing, but...

639
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,449
I don't have it, but my brother does.

640
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,417
- Are you working on anything now?
- Besides the thing with Dick?

641
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:26,359
Oh, right. Yeah.

642
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:27,521
How about you?

643
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:32,568
- I'm working on some abstract...
- No one fills the ice cube trays here.

644
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,634
- Sorry, what were you saying?
- No. It's okay.

645
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:39,038
- No, what were you saying?
- It really... Nothing.

646
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,677
- Okay.
- I was saying I'm working on some

647
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,680
abstractions in acrylic paint,
but it's not...

648
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,579
I'm not getting paid or anything.

649
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,244
I don't know.
I hate that question, "What do you do?"

650
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,350
- You asked me.
- I know, but...

651
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,890
I think we shouldn't mention the tree.

652
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:00,156
We should let them know there'll be
people and music on Saturday,

653
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,526
and it'll be louder than usual.

654
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:03,327
Yeah, and they can come over
for a glass of champagne,

655
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,561
but you tell them.
I think they respond to you better.

656
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,500
Well, I am ultimately one of them.

657
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,196
You shouldn't have made me
shave the 'stache.

658
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,295
Yeah, right.

659
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:14,639
Hey. Ingrid is asking if I was ever gay.
Do you know what that's about?

660
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:15,712
No.

661
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:25,986
Hi. I'm Pauline. This is Malcolm.

662
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,614
We met you before.
We're your neighbours.

663
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,283
You gonna cut that tree down?

664
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,551
Well, we grew up with that tree,

665
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,631
and we're getting married
under it on Saturday.

666
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,828
Its roots are growing into our property.
It's rotting. It's killing our plants.

667
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,473
We had the tree doctor out
and he said it was healthy.

668
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,805
- Would it hurt you to say anything?
- What do you want from me?

669
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,108
You're making me do
the whole fucking thing.

670
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,377
- You brought up the tree.
- He brought up the tree.

671
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:57,648
I'm sorry. This was better thought
through back at the house.

672
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,086
We were wondering
if you and your wife,

673
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:02,454
I'm sorry, I forgot her name,
would like to come over for a glass...

674
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,153
You should ask her.
She makes the plans.

675
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,593
I'm gonna go in now.

676
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,261
I feel like you didn't give me a chance
to say what I wanted to say.

677
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,173
- I want to punch that guy in the nose.
- You've never hit anyone.

678
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,536
- I have too!
- Who?

679
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,234
Lots of people. You don't know them.

680
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,209
They're not around
'cause I punched them.

681
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:26,271
Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not funny.
I'll punch your sister!

682
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:28,611
The threat is not out there.

683
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,244
It's in our house.
It's sleeping in my studio.

684
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,317
I mean, I wouldn't actually hit her.

685
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,587
But I feel like doing it.
She's such a fucking idiot.

686
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,355
She's not an idiot.
You might not like her.

687
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,226
She is. She's an idiot! You're an idiot.

688
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,424
- Jesus!
- You're both fucking morons.

689
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,662
I am so fucking... I am trying so hard.

690
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,294
You don't give me any credit!

691
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:50,703
- What is wrong?
- I don't know.

692
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:55,302
I have the emotional version
of whatever bad feng shui would be.

693
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:58,210
I don't know. You tell me.
You understand this shit.

694
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,978
- Did you drink your teas?
- Yeah, I drank my fucking teas.

695
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:04,178
Really, I think when you look back
at this you're going to see

696
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:07,621
I'm not acting like a crazy person.
That this is the right reaction.

697
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,919
In proportion with what's going on,
this is right.

698
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,336
Let's make love.

699
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,613
- Jim.
- Hey.

700
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,576
How are you?

701
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,488
- Dad!
- Claude!

702
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:40,557
Hey.

703
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:42,885
It was a difficult decision,

704
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,427
because Claude has so many friends
in school now.

705
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:48,959
But it's expensive, and Bronx Science
is a great public school.

706
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,293
I didn't get into Stuyvesant.

707
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:54,063
- He's not a good test taker.
- I went to Stuy.

708
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,263
- Really?
- Really.

709
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,309
I'd rather stay at Packer,
but it's so expensive.

710
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,641
Josh is a great test taker,
but Claude thinks more abstractly.

711
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:06,409
- He's more creative. Right?
- I guess so.

712
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,615
I saw the one-armed man,
who really has two arms, at the bodega.

713
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:13,418
Really?
Did you give him confusing change?

714
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,356
I did. I tripped him up with some nickels
and a Canadian quarter.

715
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,658
You know what I tried the other day?
Sitting down to pee.

716
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,162
Have you done this, Jim?

717
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:27,492
No.

718
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:30,667
I haven't.

719
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,775
It was a joke, really.
I was gonna call in Pauline

720
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,138
and say, "Guess what I'm doing here?"

721
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,373
Sorry I didn't get to have
that experience.

722
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,175
I was just thinking, you know,

723
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:41,012
my dad used to say,
"Why stand when you can sit?"

724
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:43,018
And this is a really good example
of that.

725
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,851
I mean, it took me a long time to try,
'cause I was embarrassed.

726
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,218
But you guys do it all the time.

727
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:50,521
I never sit in a public place.
I always squat and hover.

728
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:54,058
Anyway, I recommend it.
At least to try it.

729
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,825
Jim, I'm sorry about the room.

730
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,767
It's usually Malcolm's storage room.
So, it's kind of makeshift right now.

731
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,859
It's fine.

732
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:04,306
Margot, open your gift.

733
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,645
I get self-conscious opening presents
in front of people.

734
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:13,412
- Anyway, this weekend is about Pauline.
- Pooh, Margot. Go on, open it.

735
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,187
Get on with it. Come on.

736
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,237
Those look warm.

737
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:40,640
I remember last year in Vermont
you said your feet were freezing.

738
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,444
Thank you.

739
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:48,448
You're welcome.

740
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,179
I already have slippers.

741
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,487
That's okay. Two sets are fine, right?

742
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,957
It makes me sad to get
a present I already have.

743
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:05,891
- Why?
- Makes me feel like you don't know me.

744
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,565
What's wrong with your ear?

745
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,769
I asked you not to come
and you did it anyway, so blithely.

746
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:17,745
We need time alone to sort this out.
You can't just run away.

747
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,839
Okay, we're here.
I'm giving you this time.

748
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:20,917
Well...

749
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:24,215
Now you're putting
too much pressure on me.

750
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,417
What is that?

751
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,292
Keep driving. Jim, Jim. No!

752
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,389
- I'm just seeing.
- No.

753
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,467
Stay right there.

754
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,574
Please help me.

755
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:51,374
- Please. He got hit by a car.
- Jim.

756
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,646
Jim.

757
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:57,778
- Careful. He might bite you.
- I got him. I got him.

758
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,613
Hurry, he's dying!

759
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,257
He didn't do anything.

760
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:05,351
Roger's an innocent.
He's an innocent creature.

761
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:06,759
- Oh, God.
- Margot.

762
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:08,956
I can't stand her.

763
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,399
You paid, didn't you?

764
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,243
She didn't have her purse with her.
It wasn't so expensive.

765
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,478
Roger's gonna live.

766
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:28,846
I don't give a fuck about Roger,
and that makes me feel like shit.

767
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,551
You make me feel like shit.

768
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,021
- I wouldn't have stopped.
- Of course you would have.

769
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,889
No, I wouldn't have.

770
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:42,196
- I hate myself when I'm with you.
- Margot, I'm not...

771
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,367
I can't talk to you
when you're this fucked up.

772
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:51,498
You're just like Claude in that way.
You make me feel guilty.

773
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,776
Sometimes, I find you so despicable.

774
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:20,970
What's wrong?

775
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:25,734
I don't know.

776
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,810
Before you gave me your sweater,
I don't think I realized I was cold.

777
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,582
Take me home and go away.

778
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:46,992
If it were someone else,
I'd understand it. I'd feel sympathy even.

779
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:52,059
But since it's me,
I just feel bad and horribly critical.

780
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,499
I haven't been able to tell Claude
what's happening,

781
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,629
and I have to. I'm going to.

782
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,267
How can I be all these people?
How can I be married to Jim

783
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:03,210
and fuck Dick and want them both,
and then neither of them?

784
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:07,783
I know. We're at that age where
we're becoming invisible to men.

785
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:10,749
If a guy wants to fuck us,
that's very tempting.

786
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,746
What are you saying?

787
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,984
I'm saying if you get your sense of self
from being fuckable

788
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,390
and that starts to wane, it's very hard.

789
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:22,461
I almost had an affair, too.
But you don't have to do it.

790
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:27,233
You can, I don't know,
get a manicure or something.

791
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:33,133
You know, I tell people
you're my closest friend.

792
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:36,007
- I really miss you.
- Me, too.

793
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,239
But I can't help feeling
that you really came to my wedding

794
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,181
'cause I live a mile away
from the guy you're fucking.

795
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:44,378
Come on, Pauline,
you make it sound like I'm using you.

796
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:45,476
Yeah.

797
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:48,585
You've got a...

798
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,721
- Did I get it?
- I think so.

799
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,661
Pauline, what are you doing
getting married to this guy?

800
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,257
He's not good enough for you.
He's so coarse.

801
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,530
He's like guys we rejected
when we were 16.

802
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,500
You know,
don't make a mistake like this.

803
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,575
I'm sorry. Maybe I have no right to say it.

804
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:11,272
But you know I'm truthful,
so would you rather I lie?

805
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,108
Who should I be with then?

806
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:19,211
I don't know.
Someone who's your equal.

807
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,681
You're so smart. You're brilliant.
You're funny.

808
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:26,956
You're incredibly hilarious.
Paul, you're a great teacher.

809
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,464
You're open to things.
You're so beautiful.

810
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:33,764
Hey! Hey, you! You pick that up.

811
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,997
I will call the police.
This is our property.

812
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,668
Creeps.

813
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,749
Wizard!

814
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,760
- What happened to your dad?
- He went to Vermont.

815
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,329
He didn't want to come to the wedding?

816
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,955
I don't think he could.
I think he couldn't.

817
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:07,436
- You want to see me dance?
- Okay.

818
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:22,674
Wizard.

819
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,788
You're not watching.

820
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,356
- Where you going?
- We have to get home.

821
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,664
- Is that your girlfriend?
- No, she's my cousin.

822
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,173
- You a fruity?
- No.

823
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,836
- You a fruity?
- No.

824
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:55,951
He's a Vogler.

825
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,987
- Come on. He's just a stupid boy.
- Wait. I have a rock in my shoe.

826
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:00,579
Come on, Ingrid!

827
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:01,924
Liar!

828
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,788
Ingrid, get him off me!

829
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,930
You're fucking gay. You're fucking gay.

830
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,133
No.

831
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:23,342
Hangman's ass.

832
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,948
- Don't run so fast.
- He bit me.

833
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,425
- Who bit you?
- A Vogler.

834
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:39,961
Let me see.

835
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,197
All right. That's it.
I'm calling the police.

836
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:48,429
Don't! It'll get worse.
Why did you say anything to them?

837
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,699
What are you talking about?
This isn't my fault.

838
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,901
That boy bit me 'cause you couldn't
keep your fat mouth shut.

839
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,910
Claude, you're being a jerk.

840
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,105
You shit in your shoes
and then you fuck 'em!

841
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,248
She wrote a story about Lenny and me.

842
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:07,051
Yeah. It's in here.

843
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:10,624
I mean, we were talking
almost every day at this point,

844
00:57:10,726 --> 00:57:12,193
and there was no warning.

845
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:16,356
I mean, maybe a couple of remarks
that she'd used some things of ours.

846
00:57:16,465 --> 00:57:18,933
<i>And then The New Yorker comes,
we have a subscription,</i>

847
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,559
and there's the story.

848
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:25,030
And it's things we said and did.
Stuff I told her in confidence.

849
00:57:25,808 --> 00:57:27,469
I think it helped end our marriage.

850
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:31,808
I read it and I thought, "She hates me. "

851
00:57:31,914 --> 00:57:33,279
She doesn't hate you.

852
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,678
You think?

853
00:57:37,186 --> 00:57:39,654
Margot tried to murder me
when we were girls.

854
00:57:40,389 --> 00:57:42,823
She put me on a baking sheet,
sprinkled me with paprika,

855
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:44,722
and put me in the oven.

856
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:50,559
Jim was here.

857
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:53,325
Is Jim still writing?

858
00:57:55,037 --> 00:57:57,801
I told him to go to Vermont without me.

859
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:02,539
I'd like to see him tell a linear story
for a change.

860
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,605
Jim never wanted to make it easy
for the reader, did he?

861
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:09,742
The nicest man I ever met,
but he can't play the game.

862
00:58:10,886 --> 00:58:14,083
I'm not gonna be joining him.
I'm gonna stay here.

863
00:58:15,424 --> 00:58:16,448
We'll see.

864
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,419
All right?

865
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:22,425
Okay?

866
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:25,693
I didn't ask you to do that.

867
00:58:29,972 --> 00:58:31,837
That guy is pointing at us.

868
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:36,408
<i>I'm very interested in your story
"Middle Children. "</i>

869
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:40,543
<i>The father is a loathsome character,</i>

870
00:58:40,649 --> 00:58:44,176
<i>yet we also feel
a strange sympathy for him.</i>

871
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:50,155
<i>Well, I was really interested in exploring
a father/daughter relationship.</i>

872
00:58:51,827 --> 00:58:57,993
<i>While he clings to her,
desperately, he suffocates her really.</i>

873
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:04,430
<i>He also silently resents
the responsibility of parenthood.</i>

874
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:09,567
<i>There's this sexualized
push-pull with Daphne,</i>

875
00:59:09,678 --> 00:59:13,774
<i>- which I find...
- He craves isolation.</i>

876
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:17,010
<i>I always saw him as someone who</i>

877
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,919
<i>so over-identifies with
everyone around him</i>

878
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:25,925
<i>that he begins to lose
all sense of himself.</i>

879
00:59:26,595 --> 00:59:28,825
<i>But you make his only recourse
to abandon his family,</i>

880
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:32,367
<i>- including his beloved daughter.
- Yes, yes, that's true.</i>

881
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:38,305
<i>I write historical fiction,
so I don't have to answer to this,</i>

882
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:42,241
<i>but I wonder, for someone
who writes so nakedly about family,</i>

883
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:45,745
<i>how autobiographical is this portrait?</i>

884
00:59:47,716 --> 00:59:49,843
<i>My father was a loving person.</i>

885
00:59:49,952 --> 00:59:53,012
<i>He had his days, of course,
but he was devoted to us as children.</i>

886
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:55,852
<i>I would never have written this portrait,
were it true.</i>

887
00:59:58,327 --> 01:00:02,559
<i>But I'm interested in how the father
could be, in fact, a portrait of you.</i>

888
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:09,698
<i>I don't...</i>

889
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:13,869
<i>Why do you assume that it's...</i>

890
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:17,739
<i>That, I mean, we all take from life.</i>

891
01:00:22,184 --> 01:00:24,914
<i>I had to have our refrigerator repaired
the other day</i>

892
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,580
<i>at our apartment in Manhattan,</i>

893
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:32,093
<i>and I was alone with this guy.</i>

894
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:33,889
<i>I think he was Puerto Rican.</i>

895
01:00:33,996 --> 01:00:37,488
<i>He was sent over by Whirlpool,</i>

896
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,468
<i>who I think it is, makes our fridge.</i>

897
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:47,508
<i>Although he did say that he worked for
an independent organization,</i>

898
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,134
<i>that Whirlpool subcontracts.</i>

899
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,271
<i>I think he was retarded.</i>

900
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:57,115
<i>There was...</i>

901
01:00:58,387 --> 01:01:03,188
<i>There was an anger in him,
and suddenly,</i>

902
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:07,088
<i>suddenly I became afraid for my life.</i>

903
01:01:10,399 --> 01:01:14,927
<i>I called Jim at NYU, and I...</i>

904
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,163
<i>I asked him to come home.</i>

905
01:01:22,611 --> 01:01:25,171
<i>I think it was Frigidaire
who made our fridge.</i>

906
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:33,151
<i>I'm gonna need...
I'm gonna need to take a moment here.</i>

907
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:45,832
You're an asshole.

908
01:02:01,483 --> 01:02:04,850
- I need to be alone right now, okay?
- What's wrong?

909
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:09,186
I don't know.
I'll tell you sometime. Go on.

910
01:02:09,658 --> 01:02:10,920
Are you sure?

911
01:02:11,026 --> 01:02:13,927
Yeah. Go with Mom. I'll see you later.

912
01:02:14,029 --> 01:02:16,293
- You said Mom.
- You know what I mean.

913
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:17,592
Go with Pauline.

914
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:22,664
Jesus, do I need to spell it out for you?

915
01:02:25,307 --> 01:02:26,638
Go with her.

916
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,578
<i>There was blood on the floor,</i>

917
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,047
<i>and it was cold,
and it was snowing inside the hallway.</i>

918
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:39,752
There was all these like
weird like torture devices,

919
01:02:39,855 --> 01:02:44,087
and to get out of them,
you had to like torture yourself.

920
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:45,956
I wasn't so scared
while it was happening.

921
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:48,427
I was more scared afterwards.
It was like

922
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:51,159
I was in it and I was just spectating.

923
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:54,431
I didn't have to do any of the stuff.

924
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:59,469
I could teach you to swim if you like.
We wouldn't have to tell your mom.

925
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,271
I don't really want to.

926
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,916
- I like Malcolm.
- You do? Good.

927
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:12,086
I do, too. I don't know.

928
01:03:13,822 --> 01:03:15,847
It's hard, I think,
to find people in the world

929
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,789
you love more than your family.

930
01:03:19,194 --> 01:03:22,630
You're your mom's favorite.
Do you know that?

931
01:03:22,731 --> 01:03:25,666
She's always liked you best,
more than Jim even.

932
01:03:27,302 --> 01:03:28,792
Has she talked to you yet?

933
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:32,340
I don't think so. About what?

934
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:33,908
You okay?

935
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:37,071
It's hard to see your mom
like that, right?

936
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:38,168
Get attacked like that?

937
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:42,175
It was mean what he did.
I think it was really shitty.

938
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:44,750
- I think Dick's an asshole.
- Yeah.

939
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:50,388
You know,

940
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:52,858
your mom's going through
a rough time right now.

941
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:56,497
And she can be scary when she's angry.

942
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,096
Whatever she says, like if she tells you
she's leaving your father, just know,

943
01:04:02,204 --> 01:04:04,968
well, she often changes her mind.

944
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:07,770
And I don't want you to worry
about anything right now.

945
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,974
- He's cutting it down.
- Good.

946
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,779
My dad's late to pick me up.
I hope I'm not a pain.

947
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:18,910
You're not a pain, Maisy.

948
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:31,523
I told Paul
I didn't want you guys to come.

949
01:04:31,633 --> 01:04:33,157
I thought it was interesting.

950
01:04:34,636 --> 01:04:37,935
- What did Paul say?
- I think she liked it.

951
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,735
Yeah, right.

952
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:45,013
- Did you talk about me afterwards?
- No.

953
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:49,107
- I can tell you're lying.
- We didn't, Mom.

954
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,879
I don't trust her.

955
01:04:53,655 --> 01:04:56,647
Pauline told me
she's very disappointed in you.

956
01:04:57,226 --> 01:05:00,753
- Why?
- She thinks you laze about the house.

957
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:03,957
Ingrid's always offering to help
clean and cook.

958
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:09,905
She made bracelets for all the guests.
Even Malcolm puts up the tent.

959
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:12,834
You wait until everyone else
does it for you.

960
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:15,068
- That's not true.
- It is true.

961
01:05:17,045 --> 01:05:19,513
I wish I'd taught you better manners.

962
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:23,141
I can try to make popovers,
if I can remember how.

963
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,685
Don't bother.

964
01:05:30,592 --> 01:05:32,617
Why are you looking at me like that?

965
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:36,163
I just see how much you've changed.

966
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:41,703
Your body language.
You used to be rounder, more graceful.

967
01:05:41,937 --> 01:05:44,906
You're so stiff now, so blasé.

968
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,169
I can't explain it.

969
01:05:54,516 --> 01:05:55,710
It's okay though.

970
01:06:07,462 --> 01:06:09,293
You're still handsome.

971
01:06:11,733 --> 01:06:13,530
Are you able to do this yourself?

972
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,396
Pauline, do you want me
to cut it down or not?

973
01:06:18,173 --> 01:06:19,697
Watch the tent.

974
01:06:35,357 --> 01:06:37,086
I liked how it looked on Vogler.

975
01:06:37,192 --> 01:06:41,253
I think it's over between Margot
and Dick. He was so cruel to her today.

976
01:06:41,363 --> 01:06:44,059
And poor Claude had to watch it all.

977
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,360
She should just get out of the marriage,

978
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:47,662
and then she can fuck
whoever she wants, you know.

979
01:06:47,769 --> 01:06:49,634
And Dick Koosman...

980
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:52,969
I agree.
I hate the idea of Dick fucking Margot.

981
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:54,838
What does that mean?
You want to fuck Margot?

982
01:06:54,943 --> 01:06:56,774
Pauline, that's not what I said.

983
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:58,972
I know you have a crush on her.
You already told me that.

984
01:07:00,315 --> 01:07:02,010
I didn't say that!

985
01:07:02,117 --> 01:07:05,280
I said I thought she was attractive
after you grilled me.

986
01:07:05,854 --> 01:07:09,483
She has no interest in me anyway,
not that it would matter if she did.

987
01:07:09,591 --> 01:07:11,456
Have you ever done anything like that?

988
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:16,454
- What do you mean?
- Have you ever cheated on me?

989
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:19,864
No! Can I do this?

990
01:07:20,535 --> 01:07:23,663
Those e-mails that you have
with that student of mine?

991
01:07:24,806 --> 01:07:25,864
Did that...

992
01:07:25,974 --> 01:07:28,067
- I know you said it was nothing.
- It was.

993
01:07:28,176 --> 01:07:31,043
I just... Can you say it again?

994
01:07:31,146 --> 01:07:34,115
I just did. Now can I cut down the tree?

995
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,616
- You never did anything with her?
- No.

996
01:07:36,718 --> 01:07:41,018
She e-mailed me
after that reading at the college,

997
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:43,518
- and, you know, we were friends.
- Right.

998
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:46,219
Just a regular friendship
between you and a 20-year-old girl.

999
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,523
Pauline,
how many times do I have to say it?

1000
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:49,927
But why don't I believe it?

1001
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:52,057
Because Margot can't understand
why you're with me,

1002
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:54,601
and now when she's around,
you look for things.

1003
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,663
- You promise?
- I promise.

1004
01:07:59,174 --> 01:08:01,642
Okay. I'm sorry.

1005
01:08:03,645 --> 01:08:04,771
It's okay.

1006
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:20,918
- I'm gonna tell you something.
- What?

1007
01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:24,260
- I don't want to lose you though, okay?
- What?

1008
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:28,332
I'm gonna tell you, just let me...

1009
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,534
Maisy.

1010
01:08:32,941 --> 01:08:35,136
- I don't wanna know.
- We didn't really do anything.

1011
01:08:35,243 --> 01:08:36,437
We were goofing around.

1012
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:39,070
I was making fun of her
'cause she dates a jock.

1013
01:08:39,848 --> 01:08:42,874
I shouldn't have put myself
in that position, I know that.

1014
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:47,144
We brushed lips.
Really, it was hardly a kiss.

1015
01:08:47,255 --> 01:08:49,655
And then we stopped. That was it.

1016
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,257
Our tongues touched.

1017
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:56,297
I don't wanna undersell it either.
I mean, we made out.

1018
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:58,764
I made out with her.

1019
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:01,927
I don't know why. I don't even like her.

1020
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:04,772
It's been a heady time.

1021
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:10,807
What are you thinking?
Please tell me what you're thinking.

1022
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:18,819
Has anyone seen Wizard?

1023
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,115
No. Where's Maisy?

1024
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:32,396
Hi. Sorry, I had to go.
I hope that's okay. I used yours.

1025
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:42,074
I love your wedding dress.
It's so unconventional and great.

1026
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:01,355
- Is everything okay?
- Nothing.

1027
01:10:02,864 --> 01:10:04,855
Hey, Claude,
do you want to play croquet?

1028
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:06,058
Okay.

1029
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,069
There's Dick!

1030
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,576
Dad!

1031
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:24,152
Malcolm...

1032
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:28,081
- Is it almost ready?
- Almost.

1033
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:04,288
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything! No!

1034
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:13,057
You fucking sleazebag!

1035
01:11:19,374 --> 01:11:23,777
Fuck off, dickhead! No! No!

1036
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:30,549
- I don't ever want to see you again.
- You fucking dickbag! She's lying!

1037
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:36,887
Oh, man!

1038
01:11:52,607 --> 01:11:56,907
<i>He looked everywhere
and tried to find her</i>

1039
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:59,344
- Come with me to New York.
- I can't talk about it.

1040
01:11:59,447 --> 01:12:02,211
Okay. But you can't marry him.
I mean, you have to leave.

1041
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:04,308
We can think about what to do
with the baby when we get to...

1042
01:12:04,419 --> 01:12:06,614
- Margot, I can't.
- Don't turn vague. Listen to me.

1043
01:12:06,721 --> 01:12:08,518
I want you to pack all your things
and get out of here.

1044
01:12:08,623 --> 01:12:10,818
You can take our car
and leave it at the ferry.

1045
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:12,587
I can make popovers.

1046
01:12:14,262 --> 01:12:16,628
Do you love me? Good.

1047
01:12:16,898 --> 01:12:19,059
Don't you take this out on me.
I'm on your side.

1048
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:20,134
No, you're not.

1049
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:21,896
I kept my mouth shut
because I wanted to...

1050
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:25,632
No, you haven't kept your mouth shut.
No, you haven't kept your mouth shut!

1051
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:30,006
Okay, I told you. And I was right.
I mean, he's done an insane thing.

1052
01:12:30,111 --> 01:12:33,205
You don't know this man.
What he did is criminal.

1053
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:35,909
- Margot, I can't.
- It's pedophilia.

1054
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:38,843
Get out.

1055
01:12:40,555 --> 01:12:44,855
Becky and I talk about you,
about what a monster you are.

1056
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,394
Is it 'cause Mom gave me the house?

1057
01:12:47,495 --> 01:12:51,056
We've been talking about you.
Becky can't stand you.

1058
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:54,067
Becky says you have
borderline personality disorder.

1059
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:57,263
- What are you saying?
- Can't I have anything?

1060
01:12:57,372 --> 01:13:00,239
What was I thinking?
I can't have anything.

1061
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:04,904
I let you in. God damn, dude!
You're such an asshole!

1062
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:10,341
You hate me.
You're such a fucking asshole!

1063
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:13,785
Get out of my fucking house! Get out!

1064
01:13:13,888 --> 01:13:16,618
I don't recognize you.
It's like you're channeling someone.

1065
01:13:17,058 --> 01:13:18,047
Ingrid!

1066
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:20,785
Ingrid!

1067
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:23,221
Ingrid!

1068
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:31,639
Come on.

1069
01:13:35,143 --> 01:13:36,132
Okay.

1070
01:13:36,244 --> 01:13:39,702
- It wasn't gonna fall.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1071
01:13:41,916 --> 01:13:43,247
Wizard!

1072
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,508
I thought you couldn't drive.

1073
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:11,511
Of course I can drive.
Why does everyone say that?

1074
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,103
I used to drive.

1075
01:14:13,214 --> 01:14:15,546
We have to call people and cancel.

1076
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:17,174
Can I still sing?

1077
01:14:20,855 --> 01:14:24,120
- You do smell.
- Well, I'm not wearing any deodorant.

1078
01:14:24,225 --> 01:14:26,193
- Shit.
- What?

1079
01:14:26,294 --> 01:14:30,924
I don't think... No.
We don't have any brakes.

1080
01:14:31,933 --> 01:14:34,197
- The brakes are bad. That's right.
- What does that mean?

1081
01:14:34,302 --> 01:14:37,465
- What do you think it means?
- I mean, what can we do?

1082
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,262
Mom!

1083
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:42,073
- Don't!
- Shit!

1084
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:48,573
I've ruined these shoes.

1085
01:14:54,255 --> 01:14:56,052
Mom, are you okay?

1086
01:14:56,157 --> 01:14:57,784
Don't look. Shit!

1087
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,289
- Mom, what happened?
- Nothing.

1088
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:05,262
Did she poop in her pants?

1089
01:15:06,067 --> 01:15:08,763
It happens to everyone, not just babies.

1090
01:15:09,003 --> 01:15:10,698
It'll happen to you too, someday.

1091
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:17,238
I left Mom and Becky a message.

1092
01:15:17,912 --> 01:15:20,142
I don't think Mom knows
how to work the machine.

1093
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:24,584
I can hear it flapping.

1094
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,916
You should take care of that.
It can hatch eggs.

1095
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:54,442
Okay, I'm gonna tell him.

1096
01:15:54,749 --> 01:15:57,445
No. I don't want him to...

1097
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:01,049
And I'll put him on the bus. Bye.

1098
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:13,098
Sweetie, there's a bus that leaves to
Vermont from town tomorrow morning.

1099
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:16,364
I just talked to your dad,
and he'll be there to pick you up.

1100
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:19,304
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

1101
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,873
Why not?

1102
01:16:21,976 --> 01:16:24,911
Because I have to help out
Paul and Ingrid.

1103
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:26,913
Then I don't want to leave tomorrow.

1104
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:38,922
There's Malcolm!

1105
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:42,056
No, honey.

1106
01:16:43,364 --> 01:16:45,525
I can't live in that house alone.

1107
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:47,727
You're gonna be fine.

1108
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:51,704
Maybe I could get a place in Brooklyn,
Williamsburg or something.

1109
01:16:51,806 --> 01:16:53,330
People are living there, right?

1110
01:16:53,441 --> 01:16:56,535
No, you don't want to live there.
It's only young people.

1111
01:16:56,644 --> 01:16:58,771
But what do you think of that idea?

1112
01:16:59,747 --> 01:17:01,977
Maybe. Maybe. Let's see.

1113
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:04,144
Listen, if you don't want
to come with me,

1114
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:06,686
I'm sure Mom will let you stay with her.

1115
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:08,983
You're already trying to pass me off
on to Mom.

1116
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:12,253
Don't say that. You're coming with me.

1117
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,657
You don't even know
where you're gonna live.

1118
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:16,286
You might have to move in
with Mom, too.

1119
01:17:16,631 --> 01:17:17,620
What?

1120
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:22,792
You said you were going to tell him.
I'm sorry.

1121
01:17:25,573 --> 01:17:27,473
What have I done?

1122
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:30,909
What have I done?

1123
01:17:45,226 --> 01:17:47,717
- What?
- Nothing.

1124
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:51,796
Just then I felt so much love for you.

1125
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:55,393
Good night, Mommy.

1126
01:18:05,146 --> 01:18:06,238
Hey!

1127
01:18:06,347 --> 01:18:08,338
You cannot write about this.
You can't have it.

1128
01:18:08,449 --> 01:18:09,939
That wasn't about you.

1129
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:11,109
You already took a part of my life,

1130
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:12,686
that story you wrote
about Lenny and me.

1131
01:18:12,787 --> 01:18:14,186
- It wasn't about you.
- It ruined our marriage.

1132
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:15,256
Oh, God.

1133
01:18:15,356 --> 01:18:17,085
You can't have any more.

1134
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:19,483
And that goes for Ingrid
and Malcolm and Wizard.

1135
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:21,186
We all own our own rights.
They're not for sale.

1136
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:23,422
Give it back. Give it.

1137
01:18:24,365 --> 01:18:26,629
If I could read your handwriting,
I'm sure I'd be furious.

1138
01:18:28,069 --> 01:18:31,698
But if I ever see a story that involves
a hotel room or any of this shit,

1139
01:18:33,374 --> 01:18:35,239
I will fucking take your bowels out.

1140
01:18:45,453 --> 01:18:48,718
You've now successfully ruined
two of my marriages.

1141
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,816
You're not wearing any underwear.

1142
01:18:51,926 --> 01:18:55,589
It's hot. I'm pregnant. Move over. Jesus.

1143
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:59,798
You're not hot. Your feet are cold.

1144
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:03,564
Stop touching me. I am so hot.
Feel my head.

1145
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:09,233
You got a fever.

1146
01:19:09,777 --> 01:19:12,507
I don't have a fever. I'm pregnant.

1147
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:15,447
- Are you always like this?
- Get used to it.

1148
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:20,719
Mom and Becky share a bed.
You and I will probably get the other.

1149
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,185
You should just go to Vermont.

1150
01:19:25,493 --> 01:19:27,688
You know, I was thinking,

1151
01:19:28,529 --> 01:19:31,657
if you want,
you and Ingrid could go to Vermont.

1152
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:34,759
Keep Claude company.

1153
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,297
Jim adores you.

1154
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:41,905
You don't like Malcolm
because you're not attracted to him.

1155
01:19:42,176 --> 01:19:44,144
- Will you do it?
- No.

1156
01:19:45,713 --> 01:19:47,078
I won't do that for you.

1157
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:55,479
Did you two talk about me today?

1158
01:19:58,326 --> 01:19:59,350
What did you say?

1159
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:06,462
I told him you often change your mind.

1160
01:20:27,488 --> 01:20:29,820
I'm sorry, sweetie.
There's something wrong with me.

1161
01:20:29,924 --> 01:20:33,291
- I'm gonna call him.
- Don't do that, I'm telling you...

1162
01:20:33,394 --> 01:20:35,453
I need some clothes and things.

1163
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:38,421
He should get the hell out of our house.

1164
01:20:38,933 --> 01:20:41,367
Okay, I'll tell him to get the hell out
of our house.

1165
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:53,607
You left it in my room.

1166
01:21:04,592 --> 01:21:06,958
<i>The tent looks so lonely.</i>

1167
01:21:07,061 --> 01:21:08,722
There's no one to get married in it.

1168
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:11,594
<i>I know, and it's totally smashed.</i>

1169
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:15,760
I'm such a fucking idiot.
Please don't take me seriously.

1170
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:20,004
I mean, take me seriously,
but not the fucked-up parts, you know.

1171
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:23,740
I love you so much. Please marry me.

1172
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,278
You can't do what you did again.
Do you understand?

1173
01:21:28,382 --> 01:21:29,679
<i>I promise.</i>

1174
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:31,979
No matter how tempting.

1175
01:21:46,467 --> 01:21:48,958
I don't know. I don't know.

1176
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:54,237
I ate some of the cake.
I don't know why, but I did it.

1177
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:56,401
Well, how was it?

1178
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:58,476
<i>Good.</i>

1179
01:21:58,579 --> 01:22:02,310
Not too sweet? They sometimes make
their stuff too sweet.

1180
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:03,781
<i>Maybe.</i>

1181
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:07,013
Maybe it was. I didn't even notice.

1182
01:22:07,121 --> 01:22:10,613
They fucked up the cake. How sad.

1183
01:22:11,659 --> 01:22:15,095
I miss you. I love our little baby.

1184
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:17,296
I miss you.

1185
01:22:20,401 --> 01:22:24,633
I miss you, too.
Maybe we should do another seminar.

1186
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:32,605
I can't understand you, honey.

1187
01:22:41,322 --> 01:22:43,017
Honey, I can't understand you.

1188
01:22:46,093 --> 01:22:48,653
There's Nana and Aunt Becky,
and they have ice cream.

1189
01:22:48,796 --> 01:22:50,491
They didn't get my message.

1190
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,589
I told you, she doesn't know
how to work the machine.

1191
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,292
What, you're not coming?

1192
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:56,428
I'm coming. I'm coming.
What did he say?

1193
01:22:56,804 --> 01:22:58,431
- Mom!
- Nana!

1194
01:22:58,539 --> 01:23:00,439
- What did he say?
- Nana!

1195
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:03,101
- Mom, hey.
- Hey, was that Margot I saw?

1196
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:05,839
- Don't look, keep walking.
- Why are we going this way?

1197
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:07,812
We have to get you to your bus.

1198
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:11,718
Did you do something?

1199
01:23:12,453 --> 01:23:14,080
What do you mean, do something?

1200
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:17,254
I mean,
why is the wedding not happening?

1201
01:23:17,358 --> 01:23:18,985
Is it something that you did?

1202
01:23:19,093 --> 01:23:21,721
Pauline has transferred
all of her stuff onto me.

1203
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,892
I don't understand her anymore.

1204
01:23:26,734 --> 01:23:29,498
Why did she pick that guy?
It's really berserk.

1205
01:23:30,037 --> 01:23:32,597
You know, she referred to me
as her closest friend.

1206
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:38,907
We never see one another.
I mean, we're not close,

1207
01:23:39,046 --> 01:23:41,071
even if we wanted to be.

1208
01:23:48,489 --> 01:23:49,820
But was there anything real?

1209
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:52,518
No. How many times do I have to say it?

1210
01:23:52,827 --> 01:23:54,852
Jesus, do you think that little of me?

1211
01:24:00,067 --> 01:24:02,695
It's good you're going.
I wouldn't want to be around me, either.

1212
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:06,039
Are you gonna find
Pauline and Nana after I leave?

1213
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:09,337
I don't know. Maybe I'll go to church.

1214
01:24:10,344 --> 01:24:13,677
- Are you angry at me?
- No, honey, I'm not mad at you.

1215
01:24:14,615 --> 01:24:16,913
Everything's fine.
I'm not mad at anyone.

1216
01:24:17,018 --> 01:24:20,078
- Can you come with me?
- No. You know that.

1217
01:24:20,187 --> 01:24:22,382
Now we should talk about
the next few months a little bit,

1218
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,788
- and what's gonna happen.
- I don't like Vermont.

1219
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:26,888
Your dad is gonna be very happy
to see you,

1220
01:24:26,994 --> 01:24:29,963
and I'm sure Josh is just
dying to hang out.

1221
01:24:30,431 --> 01:24:31,898
Please come, Mom.

1222
01:24:32,266 --> 01:24:34,530
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

1223
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:40,672
You used to need me
to watch you when you played.

1224
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:42,398
What do you mean?

1225
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:44,842
When you first started playing
with friends, you wouldn't do it,

1226
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:46,880
unless I was watching.

1227
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:49,575
You were always afraid
I was gonna go out the back door.

1228
01:24:49,684 --> 01:24:51,481
I don't know
where you thought I would go.

1229
01:24:51,585 --> 01:24:53,576
Our backyard didn't lead anywhere.

1230
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:00,257
I masturbated last night.

1231
01:25:00,828 --> 01:25:03,763
While everyone was asleep,
I went into the bathroom and did it.

1232
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:06,292
You don't need to tell me that, sweetie.

1233
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:12,896
- You've got to go.
- How will you get home?

1234
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:15,040
I don't know.

1235
01:25:15,142 --> 01:25:19,602
Maybe I'll get Dick to drive me to the...

1236
01:25:21,882 --> 01:25:24,282
I lost the word for a second, the train.

1237
01:25:25,686 --> 01:25:28,211
Come on.
You always don't want to leave me,

1238
01:25:28,322 --> 01:25:30,916
and you always have a good time
once you do.

1239
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:35,061
- I think you like getting away from me.
- I don't. I like hanging out with you.

1240
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:56,383
They make your face look too wide.

1241
01:26:00,287 --> 01:26:02,448
- See you soon.
- Bye, sweetie.

1242
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:04,621
Say you'll see me soon.

1243
01:26:04,725 --> 01:26:08,092
Hey, you're acting like a baby. Go on.

1244
01:26:44,665 --> 01:26:45,689
Wait!

1245
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:49,293
Wait!

1246
01:26:50,938 --> 01:26:51,905
Wait!

1247
01:26:55,776 --> 01:26:56,902
Wait!

1248
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:11,557
- Did you see me running out there?
- Yeah.

1249
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:19,596
That was a lot of running.

1250
01:27:21,368 --> 01:27:23,461
I'm out of breath.
