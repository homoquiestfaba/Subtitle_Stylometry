75
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:26,365
it's paradise over there.

76
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:29,285
On the one hand,
you can't believe the beauty.

77
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,789
On the other hand,
they don't even have toilets.

78
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:38,628
I told Giuseppina that "you're gonna
live the life of a proud American lady.

79
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:42,673
And I'm gonna have my second
set of children with you."

And they'll be deluged
with a life

81
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:47,303
that they could never even
imagine over there.

82
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:51,015

Yeah. Numbers

like for you, 3-1-8.

120
00:07:11,155 --> 00:07:12,448
You bet a quarter,

121
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:13,950
and if your numbers
come on at the racetrack,

122
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,453
then you win
$125 for a quarter.

- For a quarter?
- Mmm.

124

You know, Janice, she, uh...

143
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,092
She went to her catechism.

144
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:15,094
She practiced her Latin.

145
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:18,014
She even stopped watching those
two <i>stunods,</i> Sonny and Cher,

146
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,515
long enough to think
about God, huh?

147
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,183
Too much fucking
salt on this.

148
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,186
At least for a minute or two,
but... boy, did she cost me.

149
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,938
You know,
I made a bet that, uh,

150
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:28,399
Janice would not do
her religious duties.

151
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:32,111
But if Janice did,
you know, got confirmed...

152
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:34,322

00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,960
I gotta talk to Johnny Soprano,
the putrescible trash routes.

524
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,795
The Sposato Brothers
are making a grab.

525
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,381
You didn't hear? Johnny's gonna
be a guest of the government.

526
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:18,966
He couldn't make bail.

527
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,218
When my brother's away,
everything goes through me.

528
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:22,553
You got diarrhea?

529
00:35:22,637 --> 00:35:23,930

530
00:35:24,013 --> 00:35:25,223
Comedian.

531
00:35:31,771 --> 00:35:33,147
The three C's I owe you.

532
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,608
What the fuck is this?
It's supposed to be cash.

533
00:35:35,691 --> 00:35:37,026
That's an RCA.

534
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,615
What am I gonna do with this?

535
00:35:49,163 --> 00:35:50,665
[kisses]

536
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:55,252
What a blow.

537
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:57,922
[voice shaking] Yeah, well, at least
you still got your brother. I'm...

538
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,177
Yeah. I got nobody.

539
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,931
Dickie, consider me your
brother from now on, huh?

540
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,107
Where's your brother?

541
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,276
He went to see if he could sneak into
the room where they do the bodies.

542
00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:23,531

You have no respect for my
father, you fucking animals!

He's dead!

557
00:37:03,779 --> 00:37:05,573
[Carmine] Looks like the riots are
ending though, Dick, that's good news.

How are you?

572
00:38:28,364 --> 00:38:32,451
You know, I'm sorry,
I know I never came to visit you before.

573
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:34,120
My father wouldn't allow it.

I came to tell you...

00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:49,009
your brother, my dad...
he passed.

577
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,303
They burned him up
in the riots.

578
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:55,683
I brought you
some sfogliatelle.

579

Oh.

00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,402
Well, you being

out of contact
with the family,

583
00:39:08,028 --> 00:39:09,572
my old man said
you deserved it,

584
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:12,700
but I want to do whatever I can
to help you from now.

585
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,785
It wasn't right
how they treated you.

586
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,663
I was 25.

587
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:21,542
I murdered a made guy
in our own family.

588
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:24,920
I'm here for a good reason.
You don't need to help me.

589
00:39:25,921 --> 00:39:27,214
[sighs] But...

590
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,841
What do you want, Richard?

591
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,932
I'll be honest with you.

592
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:41,228
I want to do a good deed.

00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,563
Huh!

595
00:39:45,482 --> 00:39:46,859
A good deed.

It's a record.

I'm a jazz nut.

601
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,628
Bring me a copy

602
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,546

We're gonna go down
to Bamberger's.

608

[Dickie] Mmm.

00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,917
Could you give us
a few minutes?

612
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,335

617
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,313
I cut hair back in Ariano.

You don't need to do that.

619
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:10,567
I want to keep
taking care of you.

620
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:14,905
But I like to work, Dickie.
And America has so many work.

Johnny's just gonna
want to hit him,

644

and he can't because of
the glass partition

645
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:42,409

get frustrated.

Livia, take one for yourself.
One for Janice.

Let me go talk to him.

652
00:42:55,464 --> 00:42:57,591
I promised Johnny I'd take care
of Tony while he was in jail.

653
00:42:57,674 --> 00:43:00,260

you just confuse him.

658
00:43:15,484 --> 00:43:18,696
Oh, can't you read
a regular comic?

659
00:43:18,779 --> 00:43:20,739
You know,
Superman, Jughead.

660
00:43:20,823 --> 00:43:23,242
It's about some
Jewish girl and a knight.

661
00:43:23,325 --> 00:43:24,827
And Robin Hood's in it.

662
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:28,288
I didn't know they had Jews
back in the Middle Ages.

663
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,416
Well... the Bible.

664
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:33,627
Anyway, your mother
asked me to talk to you, so...

665
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,380
What, about getting
suspended from school?

666
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:38,465
Hey, put that down, huh?

667
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:39,800
Sorry.

669
00:43:46,765 --> 00:43:49,977
You know I don't like to
lean on you about stuff.

670
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,522
But you can't start a
gambling operation at school.

671
00:43:53,605 --> 00:43:55,023
I know that...

672
00:43:55,107 --> 00:43:56,358
now.

673
00:43:56,442 --> 00:43:58,652
Hey, don't bullshit me.
You always knew it.

674
00:43:58,735 --> 00:44:00,821
And it's not just the gambling.
It's everything.

675
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:04,199

the air out of Mrs. Russo's tires...

- You talk big about

football team in high school

678
00:44:07,703 --> 00:44:09,538
and you're smoking
already? Oh!

679
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:12,249
You gotta have
a better attitude.

680
00:44:12,332 --> 00:44:14,960
With your father gone,
your mother's got a lot on her plate.

681
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:16,962
You gotta be good.

682
00:44:17,045 --> 00:44:19,506
I don't want to go
through this again.

683
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,175
I try to be good.

684
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:24,678
I don't think so.
Try harder.

685
00:44:29,016 --> 00:44:30,184

00:44:31,643 --> 00:44:33,687
Hey, you don't talk
to me like that.

688
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,356
See, you're not listening.

689
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,276
Fine. Pinky swear.

690
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,744
All right.

691
00:44:51,163 --> 00:44:53,165
One time I went to Playland...

692
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:56,502
I saw the cops shoot a friend
of my dad's right in the back.

693
00:44:56,585 --> 00:45:00,923
Yeah, Chickie Sasso. He still
can't move his bowels like normal.

694
00:45:04,343 --> 00:45:06,136
I don't want that
to happen to me.

695
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,389
And it won't, <i>gagootz.</i>
Not while I'm around.

696
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:12,017
We're gonna see
that it don't.

697
00:45:30,911 --> 00:45:34,873
Junior. Junior.
Where's Candy tonight?

698
00:45:34,957 --> 00:45:36,250
Migraine.

699
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,043
Again with the migraine.

700
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:40,170
[Paulie] Keep a close eye
on that one.

701
00:45:40,254 --> 00:45:43,006
She keeps disappearing, she's probably
fucking some Tom, Dick and Harry.

702
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,758
- Found a new gravy train.
- [laughs]

703
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:46,802
[man] A guy checks into a
hotel, calls up the front desk,

704
00:45:46,885 --> 00:45:50,013
"I got a leak in the sink."
Clerk says, "Go ahead.

705
00:45:50,097 --> 00:45:52,516
- Customer's always right."
- [drums beating]

706
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:55,185
Yeah, that was funnier when
Henny Youngman told it.

707
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:57,271
No, no, don't... Don't.
Just leave it the way it is.

708
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:01,233
I wonder what the origin of
the sobriquet "gravy train" is.

709
00:46:01,316 --> 00:46:03,443
They named it after
the dog food.

710
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,112
I don't know
about you, Junior.

711
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,447
Guy tells you your girlfriend's
banging somebody else,

712
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,950
you're worried about
the origin of "gravy train"?

713
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:12,160
- [Paulie] Oh!
- [laughing]

714
00:46:12,244 --> 00:46:14,079
Oh, smile, my brother.

715
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:16,790
[man singing indistinctly]

716
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:19,960
White flight.

717
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,671
Oh!
It's Hopalong <i>Che Si Dice.</i>

718
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:23,964
Whatever the fuck
that means.

719
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,676
Hey! Language.
There's ladies here.

720
00:46:27,759 --> 00:46:29,303
What can I get you?

721
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:32,264
Bartender's special tonight,
for the ladies: Pink Squirrel.

722
00:46:32,347 --> 00:46:34,641
Courvoisier and Coke.
Water back.

723
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,811
[scoffs] That what they
drink on the plantation?

724
00:46:37,894 --> 00:46:39,521
[chuckles]

725
00:46:39,605 --> 00:46:43,025
Oh, you didn't hear?
We're off the plantation.

726
00:46:43,108 --> 00:46:45,861
We got wops digging ditches
since they come over.

727
00:46:45,944 --> 00:46:47,529
Hey, come on.

728
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,586
It's Dickie's business.
Let it go, Paulie.

729
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:04,755
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

730
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:06,632
You got a murder warrant
over your head.

731
00:47:06,715 --> 00:47:09,134
I'm heading down south.
North Carolina.

732
00:47:09,217 --> 00:47:11,178
So where's your mule?
Get going.

733
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:13,138
Thing is, I need to
borrow some money.

734
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:16,016
- How much?
- A grand.

735
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:19,478
All right, I'll tell you what.

736
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:24,316
I'm gonna give you
five C's. Yeah?

737
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:26,777
It's my gift to you.
You don't gotta give it back.

738
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,695
No, I want to pay you back.

739
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,697
Ah, it's better this way. You don't
gotta be afraid to say hello to me,

740
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:34,034
I don't gotta chase you down.
Won't come between us.

741
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:36,161
So I guess this is goodbye.

742
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:44,961
Yeah, you said your goodbye,
so go.

743
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:53,053
[man singing indistinctly]

744
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:06,942
You don't stare at those people.
They don't like it.

745
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,238
[chuckles]

746
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:17,244
[Dickie] Brought you that
record you wanted.

747
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:20,122
Plus, a couple others
I picked out.

748
00:48:20,205 --> 00:48:21,915
What's this?

749
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:26,086
Al Hirt. Trumpet.
He's on Carson all the time.

750
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,047
It's not jazz. Take it back.

751
00:48:30,424 --> 00:48:32,175
These, too.

752
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:42,436
So...

753
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,271
you did your good deed.

754
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:46,189
Well, don't put it like that.

755
00:48:47,274 --> 00:48:49,234
I plan to do a lot more.

756
00:48:51,278 --> 00:48:54,239
Your poor father, huh?

757
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:59,536
He goes down to board up that
Atta Boy business that he had...

758
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:03,290
and he dies
in that horrible way.

759
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,125
It's just weird, though.

760
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,668
What, weird?

761
00:49:06,752 --> 00:49:11,631
My brother's hands were soft.
Like a baby's <i>pishadeel.</i>

762
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,843
Always with the manicures,
your father.

763
00:49:14,926 --> 00:49:16,595
Yeah, what's your point?

764
00:49:16,678 --> 00:49:21,224
He never touched a hammer
or a board in his life.

765
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:31,860
What's your problem?

766
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,742
Well, for one thing...

767
00:49:38,825 --> 00:49:41,620
my wife, she can't
get pregnant.

768
00:49:41,703 --> 00:49:45,165
You know, it takes a toll.
I want a son so bad.

769
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:46,750
What would you do?

770
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,252
It's the wanting.

771
00:49:50,003 --> 00:49:51,338
Huh?

772
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:54,674
The Buddhist will tell you:
"All life is pain."

773
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:59,179
Pain comes from
always wanting things.

774
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,224
A son is not a thing.

775
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,519
It's the wanting.

776
00:50:10,982 --> 00:50:13,902
You know, Tone, we could still run that
numbers game down at the fucking CYO.

777
00:50:13,985 --> 00:50:16,238
I got fucking suspended,
I can't get in fucking trouble again.

778
00:50:16,321 --> 00:50:18,573
No. Fucking school
will never know.

779
00:50:18,657 --> 00:50:20,200
[young Tony] I want to
make it to the NFL someday.

780
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,785
For that, I gotta
go to college.

781
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:23,954
So I gotta watch
my fucking ass.

782
00:50:24,037 --> 00:50:26,832
[young Artie] My old man told me I gotta
run his fucking restaurant when I grow up.

783
00:50:26,915 --> 00:50:28,750
What does your old man say?

784
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:30,710
[young Tony] He says I gotta fucking
rob your old man's restaurant.

785
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,462
[laughing]

786
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:35,757
Do you know who I'd wanna be?
Your Uncle Dickie.

787
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:37,551
How he fucking dresses.

788
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:41,054
He said he'd give me $500 if I
graduate from fucking high school.

789
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,556
Fuck, man.

They're gonna be here soon.
We gotta get inside and hide.

you go see <i>Dirty Harry</i> like I told you?

00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,901

00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,954
- Nothing changes.
- Yeah.

805
00:51:52,584 --> 00:51:54,044
[Johnny] Nothing changes?

806
00:51:54,127 --> 00:51:56,838
That's... that's
Poupette's house.

807
00:51:59,966 --> 00:52:01,801

- Ah, you...

808

809
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,056
How did you let this happen?

810
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:08,266
Oh, what do you want
from me, Johnny?

811
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:10,644
I had plenty on my shoulders taking care
of things while you were in the joint.

812
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,228
Yeah.

813
00:52:12,312 --> 00:52:14,356
Raising Anthony. The disaster

814
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:15,899
- Ah!
- Your wife with the cramps.

815
00:52:15,982 --> 00:52:18,568
Boo-hoo-hoo!
Look at Dickie Moltisanti.

816
00:52:18,652 --> 00:52:21,154
His father gets whacked,
he steps up.

817
00:52:21,237 --> 00:52:23,531

takes care of all the business.

818
00:52:23,615 --> 00:52:26,743

He's younger than you.

819
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,204
Yeah.

- Hey.
- Good to see you.

824
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:40,840
- [Johnny] Hey, Paulie, how's your ma, huh?
- [Paulie] Much better.

825
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,050
[Livia] Johnny.

826
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:44,636
Hey, baby, how are you?
Come here.

827
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:47,514
Oh... [chuckles]
Did the surprise work?

828
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,599
You know, I'll tell you
what surprised me.

829
00:52:49,683 --> 00:52:51,184
You got shiners on
the block, huh?

830
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:53,436
Oh, look at you.
Not a pound.

831
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,855
He's just a regular
Charlton Heston.

832
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,024
[Johnny] You come,
you visit...

833
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:01,111
But you don't tell me they moved in.
On my street.

834
00:53:01,194 --> 00:53:02,362
He's a doctor.

835
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:03,863
- A doctor.
- He's not operating on me.

836
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,782
You gotta berate me
in front of everybody?

837
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:06,741
Ah, Jesus.

838
00:53:06,825 --> 00:53:07,659
You know, just like always.

839
00:53:07,742 --> 00:53:08,702
Ah, <i>va' a Napoli.</i>

840
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:09,953
Come on.

841
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:13,873
[Janice] Hi, Dad.

842
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,417
What do you got on?

843
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,752
Go upstairs, right now,
put on some decent clothes.

844
00:53:17,836 --> 00:53:20,714
Johnny, it's what
they're wearing nowadays.

845
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,507
Go do what I said, Janice.

846
00:53:24,676 --> 00:53:27,470
Sweetie. You recognize
your daddy, pumpkin?

847
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:31,307
Yeah. That's it. Yeah.

848
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:34,769

your father a proper hello. <i>Stunod!</i>

Come here.

850

[Tony] I missed you, Dad.

851
00:53:43,278 --> 00:53:45,613

you too, kid.

852
00:53:45,697 --> 00:53:47,949

favorite pizza gain.

853

Even though it's not Easter.

854
00:53:50,076 --> 00:53:52,871
I got everybody together.
I dressed up.

855
00:53:52,954 --> 00:53:55,790
And you spit on
it all, on me!

856
00:53:55,874 --> 00:53:58,168
I didn't invite the coloreds
onto the block!

857
00:53:58,251 --> 00:53:59,836
Here we go.

858
00:53:59,919 --> 00:54:01,963
[Dickie] Livia, give him a break.
He just did four years.

859
00:54:02,047 --> 00:54:03,548
[Livia] I did four years!

860
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:06,384
[banging vessels]

861
00:54:09,471 --> 00:54:11,514
[music playing]

862
00:54:14,726 --> 00:54:16,478
I missed
your baked ziti, baby.

863
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:19,481
I put extra veal bones in
with the sausage.

864
00:54:21,274 --> 00:54:24,110
How about you, <i>chooch?</i>
You gonna be a linebacker, huh?

865
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:27,781
Coach says
I'm gonna be starting.

866
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,949
- He don't have the makings of a varsity athlete.
- [chuckles]

867
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:33,119
It was up to me,
you wouldn't be playing at all,

868
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:35,288
but you went ahead and
you forged my signature.

869
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:37,457
[laughs] Nah, relax.

870
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,792
He's not gonna get hurt.

871
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,711
[Joanne] Here he is.
Fresh from his nap.

872
00:54:41,795 --> 00:54:42,962
- [Dickie] Joanne, Joanne...
- [Joanne] Yeah?

873
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,255
He hasn't met Johnny.

874
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:45,632
Aw.

875
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:46,758
[Johnny] Wow.

876
00:54:46,841 --> 00:54:49,302
Johnny, this is
our Christopher.

877
00:54:49,385 --> 00:54:52,180
[laughter]

878
00:54:52,263 --> 00:54:56,267
[Johnny] Hello, Christopher Moltisanti.
It's your Uncle Johnny.

879
00:54:56,351 --> 00:54:57,852
I'm back from England.

880
00:54:57,936 --> 00:54:59,145
[laughs]

881
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:00,855
- Go with your daddy.
- Come here.

882
00:55:00,939 --> 00:55:03,691
Oh! <i>Bambolino!</i>

883
00:55:03,775 --> 00:55:08,029
Finally, huh? Corrado, right?
Got myself a son.

884
00:55:08,113 --> 00:55:09,072
Hi.

885
00:55:09,155 --> 00:55:11,241
I hear he's slow
with the talking.

886
00:55:11,324 --> 00:55:12,909
[Tony] Hi, Christopher, hello!

887
00:55:12,992 --> 00:55:14,285
- [Christopher crying]
- Oh!

888
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:16,371
What's the matter?
Don't cry. It's only me,

889
00:55:16,454 --> 00:55:17,956
- your Uncle Tony.
- [Dickie] Oh!

890
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:19,332
- What's wrong. Cootchie-coo!
- [Dickie] Oh! Oh!

891
00:55:19,415 --> 00:55:21,084
Okay. All right. All right.

892
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:24,129
You know, every time you're
near him he cries like this.

893
00:55:24,212 --> 00:55:25,839
I didn't do anything.

894
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:30,051
- [Joanne] What happened?
- [young Christopher giggles]

895
00:55:30,135 --> 00:55:31,261
It's okay.

896
00:55:31,344 --> 00:55:32,971
Look at that.

897
00:55:33,054 --> 00:55:35,723
I don't know what it is,
it's like I scare him or something.

898
00:55:35,807 --> 00:55:39,686
Some babies, when they
come into the world,

899
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:43,273
know all kinds of things
from the other side.

900
00:55:50,363 --> 00:55:52,282
[conga playing]

901
00:55:54,826 --> 00:55:59,831
[man 1] Night descends
As the sun's light ends

902
00:55:59,914 --> 00:56:03,168
And Black comes back,
to blend again

903
00:56:03,251 --> 00:56:05,336
- Wake up, nigga
- [audience member] Yes!

904
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,130
And with the death of the sun

905
00:56:07,213 --> 00:56:08,089
Wake up

906
00:56:08,173 --> 00:56:10,008
Night and blackness become one

907
00:56:10,091 --> 00:56:11,384
Wake up

908
00:56:11,467 --> 00:56:13,094
- Blackness being you
- [man 2] Wake up, nigga

909
00:56:13,178 --> 00:56:16,139
[man 1] Peeping through the red
The white, and the blue

910
00:56:16,222 --> 00:56:18,224
Dreaming of bars,
Black civilizations

911
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:19,893
That once flourished and grew

912
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,060
- Wake up, nigga
- Hey!

913
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,979
Wake up, niggas,
or y'all through!

914
00:56:23,062 --> 00:56:25,315
[audience]
He's right. He's right.

915
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:27,817
[man 1] Drowning in the
puddles Of the white man's spit

916
00:56:27,901 --> 00:56:29,068
[man 2] Wake up

917
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,403
[man 1] As you
pause for some drawers

918
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:32,030
- In the midst of shit
- [man 2] Wake up

919
00:56:32,113 --> 00:56:35,116
And ain't got nothing
to save your funky-ass with

920
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,493
- Wake up, nigga
- You cool, fool

921
00:56:37,577 --> 00:56:39,913
Sipping on a menthol cigarette
'round midnight

922
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:42,832
- [man 2] Wake up
- [man 1] Rapping about how the Big Apple is outta sight

923
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:45,001
- [man 2] Wake up
- [man 1] When you ain't never had a bite

924
00:56:45,084 --> 00:56:46,044
[man 2] Wake up

925
00:56:46,127 --> 00:56:48,713
Who are you fooling?
Me, you?

926
00:56:48,796 --> 00:56:51,424
[both] Wake up, niggas,
or we're all through!

927
00:56:51,507 --> 00:56:54,260
- [audience cheering]
- [woman] Yeah! Yeah!

928
00:57:04,229 --> 00:57:07,523
[Cyril] That's some inspirational shit.
Even the speeches.

929
00:57:09,609 --> 00:57:11,819
This decides me.

930
00:57:11,903 --> 00:57:14,614
Know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna start my own book.

931
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:15,782
You're gonna do what?

932
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,367
We're gonna start...

933
00:57:18,743 --> 00:57:21,996
first Black numbers bank
in the Central Ward.

934
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:30,463
Nigga, you talking about facing
down the motherfucking mafia.

935
00:57:30,546 --> 00:57:32,340
Frank Lucas will be my backer.

936
00:57:32,423 --> 00:57:35,134
He's got money
up his ass from the skag.

937
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,469
You know the Dope King?

938
00:57:36,552 --> 00:57:38,179
Down home.

939
00:57:38,263 --> 00:57:40,556
Country boys.

940
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,810
[Cyril] This ain't Greensboro,
North Cackalacky.

941
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,646
The Italians got
soldiers over there.

942
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,231
Okay?
That's what they call 'em.

943
00:57:48,314 --> 00:57:51,317
What... what's the matter,
you ain't no soldier?

944
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,236
Never thought about
myself that way, no.

945
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:54,404
Well, think about it.

946
00:57:56,864 --> 00:58:00,118
[Johnny Rocco on TV] <i>Right. "He's got
a gun," you think, "and I haven't."</i>

947
00:58:00,201 --> 00:58:01,536
<i>You figure it's the gun.</i>

948
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,580
<i>Well, listen, soldier.</i>

949
00:58:04,664 --> 00:58:08,001
<i>Thousands of guys got guns,
but there's only one Johnny Rocco!</i>

950
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:10,044
[James] <i>How do you</i>
<i>account for it?</i>

951
00:58:10,128 --> 00:58:12,130
[McCloud] <i>Well, he knows what he wants.
Don't you, Rocco?</i>

952
00:58:12,213 --> 00:58:14,048
<i>- Sure.</i>
- [James] <i>What's that?</i>

953
00:58:14,132 --> 00:58:16,092
<i>Tell him, Rocco.</i>

954
00:58:16,175 --> 00:58:17,510
<i>Well, I want, uh...</i>

955
00:58:17,593 --> 00:58:20,179
<i>He wants more.
Don't you, Rocco?</i>

956
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,015
<i>Yeah, that's it. More.</i>

957
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:23,850
<i>That's right, I want more.</i>

958
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:28,021
Here. Why don't you buy you and
your friends some of those...

959
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:29,856
McDonald's.

960
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,691
- The burgers?
- Yeah.

961
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,401
- [scoffs]
- [Johnny Rocco] <i>You, do you know what you want?</i>

962
00:58:33,484 --> 00:58:35,278
[McCloud] <i>Yes, and I</i>
<i>had hopes once, but...</i>

963
00:58:35,361 --> 00:58:37,363
[Johnny Rocco] <i>Hopes for what?</i>

964
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:40,575
[McCloud] <i>A world in which
there's no place for Johnny Rocco.</i>

965
00:58:40,658 --> 00:58:43,661
<i>Okay, soldier, you can
make your hopes come true.</i>

966
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,539
<i>But you gotta die for it.</i>

967
00:58:46,622 --> 00:58:48,624
<i>See where I'm aiming?
Right at your belly.</i>

968
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:51,210
<i>Go ahead, shoot.</i>

969
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:52,795
[whirring]

970
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,133
- Your turn, Daddy.
- [Harold] All right.

971
00:58:57,216 --> 00:58:59,135
[music playing]

972
00:59:01,637 --> 00:59:03,181
[car horn honking]

973
00:59:05,558 --> 00:59:08,686
Hey, Hopalong <i>Che Si Dice.</i>

974
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:12,357
Oh, fuck.

975
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,404
[Dickie]
How's it going, Harold?

976
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,740
Cyril, how's your ass?

977
00:59:22,033 --> 00:59:23,201
How you doing, son?

978
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,454
[Dickie] I'm taking my nephew
to the Yankees game.

979
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,414
[laughing]

980
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,958
Is something funny
back there?

981
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:32,668
Sorry, Uncle Dick.

982
00:59:32,752 --> 00:59:34,796
No, really, I'm sorry!

983
00:59:34,879 --> 00:59:36,255
You fuckstick.

984
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:38,091
[Dickie] I heard your ass
was back in Jersey.

985
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:40,051
You still got that warrant
over your head?

986
00:59:40,134 --> 00:59:43,346
Lead detective died.
Nobody gives a shit.

987
00:59:43,429 --> 00:59:45,014
Leon Overall
had been a white boy,

988
00:59:45,098 --> 00:59:47,266
it'd be a whole
different story.

989
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:51,062
Hey, Harold, how 'bout you come
around, talk to me over here.

990
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:01,072
When are you gonna come back
and work for me again?

991
01:00:02,407 --> 01:00:06,119
Got stuff of
my own percolating.

992
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,788
While you're waiting for
that Maxwell House to boil...

993
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:31,936
Hey, how much he give you?

994
01:00:34,522 --> 01:00:36,941
Like I'm a fucking
Pullman porter.

995
01:00:37,024 --> 01:00:38,776
Man, it's $100.

996
01:00:41,487 --> 01:00:42,864
[music playing]

997
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,034
[Giuseppina]
I need to see the lease.

998
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:48,995
Here you go.

999
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,121
Thank you.

1000
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:54,333
<i>Due per cento</i>
increase every year.

1001
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,502
Six and a half years still.

1002
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:57,628
Right?

1003
01:00:57,712 --> 01:00:58,921
- I like.
- Yeah.

1004
01:00:59,005 --> 01:01:00,506
[song playing indistinctly]

1005
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:01,841
It's Dionne Warwick.

1006
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,051
Comes from right over here
in South Orange.

1007
01:01:04,135 --> 01:01:05,595
I love Dionne Warwick.

1008
01:01:05,678 --> 01:01:07,138
Me, too.

1009
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:10,141
I wonder where she
gets her hair done.

1010
01:01:10,224 --> 01:01:12,977
Probably some fancy place
in Beverly Hills.

1011
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,481
I bet she pays $100.
Oof! <i>Marone!</i>

1012
01:01:16,564 --> 01:01:18,816
I should move
to Beverly's Hill.

1013
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:21,903
Where'd you learn to do hair?

1014
01:01:21,986 --> 01:01:23,863
I learned from <i>mia mamma.</i>

1015
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:25,615
- Mmm.
- My...

1016
01:01:25,698 --> 01:01:29,076
She had a chair
in the front room.

1017
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:33,331
Women would come,
and I sweep up.

1018
01:01:33,414 --> 01:01:34,373
And I watch.

1019
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:35,875
Oh, how wonderful.

1020
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,169
But that's not the life
I want for me.

1021
01:01:38,252 --> 01:01:39,754
- Mmm.
- Over there,

1022
01:01:39,837 --> 01:01:41,923
you get old so fast.

1023
01:01:42,006 --> 01:01:45,092
Ten children and a big,
black dress.

1024
01:01:45,176 --> 01:01:46,802
You know, over there,

1025
01:01:46,886 --> 01:01:49,055
I wanted to be a priest.

1026
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:52,058
- You mean "nun."
- No, no, priest.

1027
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:54,602
Nuns have to do
what they told.

1028
01:01:54,685 --> 01:01:58,189
The priest is the boss. <i>Capo.</i>

1029
01:02:00,858 --> 01:02:03,361
So you never tried
the convent, huh?

1030
01:02:03,444 --> 01:02:05,321
Not for me.

1031
01:02:05,404 --> 01:02:08,991
I could not stand the silence.
No male.

1032
01:02:09,075 --> 01:02:10,409
No, yeah.

as any two random people.

1201
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:02,357
Yeah, but two people
at the same time

1202
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:04,151
don't have
the same chance of winning.

1203
01:11:04,234 --> 01:11:05,652
That's the law of averages.

1204
01:11:05,736 --> 01:11:08,238
That's a fallacy, Ms.
Johnson. It's all random.

1205
01:11:08,322 --> 01:11:09,865
You don't understand fate.

1206
01:11:13,452 --> 01:11:15,245
What do you got
for me, professor?

1207
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:18,582
See you tomorrow.

1208
01:11:26,006 --> 01:11:28,217
Tomorrow there'll be
a brother here for the pickup.

1209
01:11:30,469 --> 01:11:32,387

[Dickie] And this Black guy,
Harold McBrayer, popped one of my guys.

1214
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:03,168
He used to be a runner
of mine.

1215
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,546
We don't know who ordered it.
We can't find McBrayer.

1216
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:08,882
So what do you
want from me?

1217
01:12:08,966 --> 01:12:11,969
I was thinking maybe
you could ask in here.

1218
01:12:12,052 --> 01:12:14,054
Nation of Islam,
talk to Alonzo Turner,

1219
01:12:14,138 --> 01:12:15,681
see if any of them
knows anything.

1220
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,183
I don't talk
to people in here.

1221
01:12:19,643 --> 01:12:21,270
I mostly read all day.

1222
01:12:25,357 --> 01:12:27,776
How you doing
on your merit badges?

01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:33,198

A who?

1225
01:12:34,867 --> 01:12:37,995
It's baseball. For blind kids.

1226
01:12:39,663 --> 01:12:41,123
Get the fuck outta here.

1227
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:42,708
No, for real.

[Mrs. Jarecki] What made
you think it was a good idea

1280
01:15:58,195 --> 01:16:00,572
to steal the answers
to the geometry test?

1281
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:05,869
I didn't study,
and, uh, I needed to pass,

1282
01:16:05,952 --> 01:16:08,538
so I could stay
on the football team.

1283
01:16:08,622 --> 01:16:09,956
You know,

1284
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,958
you got Charlie Nodzak
in trouble, too,

1285
01:16:12,042 --> 01:16:15,003
when you paid him
for the answers.

1286
01:16:15,087 --> 01:16:17,464
Well, he was the only kid
I knew on the mimeo squad.

1287
01:16:17,547 --> 01:16:20,342
Well, Charlie was
on the honor roll.

1288
01:16:20,425 --> 01:16:22,511
And you're missing the point.

1289
01:16:22,594 --> 01:16:24,721
You know stealing
the tests was wrong.

1290
01:16:26,973 --> 01:16:28,809
Yeah, I guess so.

1291
01:16:28,892 --> 01:16:30,644
But if you're gonna
kick me out of school,

1292
01:16:30,727 --> 01:16:33,313
I mean, you should just do it,
instead of us talking about it.

1293
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:37,692
You talk a lot at home?

1294
01:16:39,945 --> 01:16:41,196
I don't know.

1295
01:16:43,407 --> 01:16:47,619
Well, your dad, for example,
what does he talk to you about?

1296
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:51,915
The lawn.

1297
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:54,209
What about the lawn?

1298
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:57,295
I don't know,

1299
01:16:57,379 --> 01:17:01,341
he goes to Yankee Stadium and he comes
home and says our lawn looks crummy.

1300
01:17:01,425 --> 01:17:05,512
What about your mother?
Is she someone who likes to talk a lot?

1301

01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:11,935
Well...

1303
01:17:13,103 --> 01:17:14,896
what makes her happy?

01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,731

01:17:16,815 --> 01:17:18,024

Let's go, Anthony.

1308
01:17:25,615 --> 01:17:28,910
[Mrs. Jarecki] I wonder if I could talk
to you for a moment alone, Mrs. Soprano?

1309
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:31,371
Well, it's gonna
have to be fast,

1310
01:17:31,455 --> 01:17:33,081
'cause I'm parked
at the hydrant.

1311
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,714
[Mrs. Jarecki] On the basis
of the Stanford-Binet,

1312
01:17:40,797 --> 01:17:43,341
he's high IQ,
but you know that.

1313
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:47,220
You can't prove it by me.
He's got a D-plus average.

1314
01:17:47,304 --> 01:17:51,766
Well, that's because he doesn't
apply himself, but he is smart.

1315
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:58,607
There's a big difference between
a smart person and a smart aleck.

1316
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:03,862
I also administered the Briggs-Myer
personality inventory just now,

1317
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:06,281
and the results tell us,
he's a leader.

1318
01:18:06,364 --> 01:18:07,491

1319
01:18:07,574 --> 01:18:11,203
"Enthusiastic,
insightful, playful."

1320
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:13,914
Ah, you're talking
through your hat.

1321
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:19,711
He did tell me one thing
I'd like to share with you.

1322
01:18:19,794 --> 01:18:22,339
But it's gotta be fast,
because I'm still at the hydrant.

1323
01:18:22,422 --> 01:18:24,049

- No.

1325
01:18:25,592 --> 01:18:28,178
About the gold rush
in California?

1326
01:18:28,261 --> 01:18:30,931
Yeah, maybe I do. Yeah?

1327
01:18:31,014 --> 01:18:35,143
He told me about a night
your husband was... away.

1328
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:39,523
And you got in the bed
with Anthony and hugged him.

1329
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,240
He said that?

1330
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:51,952
No, his exact words were
you "snuggled up close."

1331
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:03,755
Yeah. Yeah,
I remember that now.

1332
01:19:03,838 --> 01:19:06,258
You read to him
from that book.

1333
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:08,176
Long into the night,
apparently.

1334
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,512
He remembered details.

1335
01:19:10,595 --> 01:19:12,264
He didn't know
the word "ingot,"

1336
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,641
and you explained it to him.

1337
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:22,899
He said it was one of his
best memories of his life.

1338
01:19:34,786 --> 01:19:36,705
[Isola] Is that a hotel Bible?

1339
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,375
I forget where I got it.

1340
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:44,588
Baby, Cousin Cyril is dead.

1341
01:19:59,978 --> 01:20:01,396
[laughter]

1342
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:02,939
[Johnny] You're supposed
to do an hour.

1343
01:20:03,023 --> 01:20:05,066
It's an hour on,
ten minutes off.

1344
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:07,986
[Dickie] All of a sudden youse two are
only on 40 minutes and then disappear.

1345
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:10,196
We don't know
where the fuck you are.

1346
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,866
We're off somewhere thinking, "What more
can we do for Gentleman Dick and Johnny?"

1347
01:20:12,949 --> 01:20:14,492

1349

The movies
with her girlfriend.

1350
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:21,291
I would eat her shit.

1351
01:20:21,374 --> 01:20:22,500
Oh!

1352
01:20:23,793 --> 01:20:24,669
[groans]

1353
01:20:26,212 --> 01:20:28,256
You don't talk
about her that way.

1354
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,508
In fact, you don't
talk about her at all.

1355
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:31,843
Hey, take it easy!

1356
01:20:31,926 --> 01:20:33,845
- I love her. I love her!

No!
