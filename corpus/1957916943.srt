1
00:02:57,779 --> 00:02:58,813
Jake.

2
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,882
Dutch.

3
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:03,250
Hey, you're not gonna
like this one, Jake.

4
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,552
Trust me.

5
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,828
Don't examine the body

6
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:49,931
until a lead investigator
is present.

7
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:54,836
Understood. But you're
half an hour late.

8
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:03,243
The priest said that he'd
never seen this woman
in the church before.

9
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:08,850
Just because he's a priest
don't mean he can't lie, Mary.

10
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:23,463
Sage.

11
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,432
Jake!

12
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,334
Wait here.

13
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:34,474
I already spoke
with Dr. Loesch.

14
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:36,944
The Artist is right
where he should be.

15
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:40,347
Just wait till CSI
finish this report.

16
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,618
Can't start jumping
into conclusions here.

17
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,899
What were you guys
talking about?

18
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:02,837
Just some old demons.

19
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,726
St. Joseph's
called again today.

20
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,934
The doctors are
giving him one week,
maybe two at the most.

21
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,435
You should go see him.

22
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:39,707
-I can't handle that.
-Mary, this is your dad.

23
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,976
Can we please just
not talk about this?

24
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,451
<i>Before the biblical God</i>
<i>created the world,</i>

25
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,921
<i>he first created the heavens.</i>

26
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:57,024
<i>And inside the heavens,</i>
<i>he created the cherubim,</i>

27
00:05:57,058 --> 00:05:59,093
<i>the angels and the archangels.</i>

28
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:02,964
<i>The archangels were essentially</i>
<i>the highest rank of angels</i>

29
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:05,666
<i>and the chief messengers</i>
<i>of God himself.</i>

30
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,138
<i>Among those archangels</i>
<i>was a being known as Lucifer.</i>

31
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:18,846
Both women
were coated in
a resinous substance.

32
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,084
The lab confirmed
it's the same compound
used on previous victims.

33
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:24,552
Previous victims?

34
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,053
I think it's pretty safe
to assume

35
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:28,756
-we have a copycat
on our hands here, folks.
-Sir?

36
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,192
One with a rather
intimate knowledge
of his predecessor.

37
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,561
-Uh, excuse me, Sheriff?
-Yes, Detective Kelly.

38
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,030
I didn't realize that
there were other murders
connected to this case.

39
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,132
I assumed Jake filled you in.

40
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,735
It must've slipped his mind.

41
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:43,170
Okay, here's
the Cliff's Notes version.

42
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:46,841
Five years ago,
serial killer Arnaud Lefeuvre,

43
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:50,978
aka "The Artist,"
abducted and murdered six women.

44
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:52,914
Prostitutes, sex workers.

45
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:58,953
First, he poisoned
and preserved them using a ricin
extracted from castor beans.

46
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:02,489
Then he'd arrange
and decorate the corpses

47
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,026
in lifelike poses
using metal frames,

48
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:08,696
leaving them to be found in
various places around the city.

49
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,033
He called them
his "masterpieces."

50
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,235
I do actually remember that.
It was before finals,

51
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,970
so the details
are a little fuzzy.

52
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,072
How did you guys
end up catching him?

53
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,574
Damn fine detective work
is how.

54
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:25,478
Done by damn fine detectives,
one of whom is sitting
right beside you.

55
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:17,124
Hey. You might want to ease up
on the caffeine there.

56
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:18,759
It's the only thing
keeping me vertical.

57
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:21,762
Sleep hasn't been
very restful for me lately.

58
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:25,633
Ah.
A railroad worker
found her about an hour ago.

59
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,238
Need to get some
photographs around here.

60
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:57,731
<i>The city is still</i>
<i>trying to recover from</i>
<i>what happened five years ago.</i>

61
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:02,103
Last thing we need
is some damn copycat
reenacting this nightmare.

62
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,405
Well, you're preaching
to the choir, sir.

63
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:09,643
Yeah. That's why I'm
considering every option.

64
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:13,247
-No way. Absolutely not.
-Think objectively here, Jake.

65
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,082
He's our best chance,
and you know it.

66
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:17,885
-Nobody would do this, sir.
-Dutch has already volunteered.

67
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:20,654
-Dutch?
-Okay, sorry. Vo--
Volunteered for what?

68
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,257
The Artist.

69
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:28,062
He wants to send Dutch
in there to see The Artist.

70
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:33,033
Oh, well, that's a bold move,
um, but worth a shot.

71
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,069
I think that if you
appeal to his ego,

72
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:38,272
he would resent the fact
that another lesser artist
is copying his work.

73
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:43,077
But I think Dutch
needs some finesse.

74
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,447
I would send someone else.

75
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,016
Who do you have in mind,
Detective?

76
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,354
Um, you're looking at her.

77
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:56,157
My background is
in psychology, so...

78
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,025
I've read your file, Mary.

79
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,762
Then what do you say?
You won't regret this.

80
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:05,099
Sir, she's not ready for this.

81
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:08,068
You know what?
I'm actually very capable
of making my own decisions.

82
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:09,670
Thank you.
I won't let you down.

83
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:17,344
I'll call Dr. Loesch,
set it up this afternoon.

84
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,246
Thank you.

85
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,055
I still deserve to be here,
you know.

86
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,357
So don't even think about
monopolizing the conversation.

87
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,026
I get to ask
some of the questions.

88
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,930
All of them actually.
I'm not going in with you.

89
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,264
What do you mean?

90
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:39,433
Well, The Artist is
only going to play ball

91
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,869
if we could somehow
win his trust.

92
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:46,840
That would be impossible
with me in the room,
considering our history.

93
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,843
You mean what?
Other than the arrest? Or...

94
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:54,081
People will remember The Artist
for the way he murdered
and preserved six women.

95
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,483
But he actually took
seven lives.

96
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,419
What are you talking about?

97
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:07,094
Zeke Anderson.
My partner of 15 years.

98
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,330
And a good friend.

99
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:13,167
The night we finally
tracked down The Artist,
Zeke was killed.

100
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,438
Jake, I'm so sorry.
I... I had no idea.

101
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:19,974
There's more.

102
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,248
That night,
we were pursuing The Artist
in a patrol car.

103
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:31,885
We collided.
Our vehicles flipped.

104
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,221
I must have
lost consciousness
for a moment

105
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:37,024
because I don't remember
Zeke getting out.

106
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,995
I just seen him standing
next to The Artist and...

107
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,164
And what?

108
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:51,071
Zeke doused himself
in gasoline

109
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,874
and set himself on fire.

110
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:33,280
Mr. Lefeuvre is
monitored around the clock.

111
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:38,185
He's actually the only resident
of a psychiatric institution
scheduled for execution.

112
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,020
The court declared
him sane, right?

113
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:43,023
Yes, I read
the mental evaluation
presented at his trial.

114
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,124
And you disagree?

115
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,060
My opinion's irrelevant.

116
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:49,463
The Artist was transferred
here to prevent
any further self-harm.

117
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,298
Self-harm?

118
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:52,634
Slashing his wrists

119
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,603
and painting on the walls
in his own blood.

120
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:00,608
Thank you.

121
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:51,291
-Mr. Lefeuvre, my name is
Detective Mary Kelly.
-I know who you are.

122
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:55,496
-Sorry. Did someone tell you
that I was coming?
-Yes. A winged friend told me.

123
00:14:57,532 --> 00:14:59,366
Well, I'm sure someone like you

124
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,370
has much better use
of their time than
conversing with birds.

125
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:06,206
And who said anything
about a bird?

126
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:11,211
The reason for my visit today
is actually because--

127
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,380
Regarding the copycat,
no doubt.

128
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:18,318
I presume you'd hoped
to pick at my brain
on the matter.

129
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,220
Yes, I was--

130
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,657
I was hoping that you
might familiarize yourself
with the case.

131
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,025
If you saw some photos
of the victims,

132
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,428
maybe you would notice
something that could help us.

133
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:30,330
And if I notice something,
what would be in it for me?

134
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,099
I just assumed
a man like you

135
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,401
wouldn't want his legacy
tarnished by an impostor.

136
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:36,236
That's semi-clever, Mary.

137
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:41,141
I'm afraid you'll have to take
a different tack with me.

138
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:43,210
Okay, then,
I will talk to Dr. Loesch

139
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,279
and see if we can get you
some better meal options.

140
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:49,316
Two weeks before my execution,
you think I'll be swayed
by a new menu?

141
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,118
Extending the time
in the yard then?

142
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,655
I abhor physical exertion
of any kind.

143
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:57,191
"No" again, I'm afraid.

144
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,627
But let's cut to the chase,
shall we?

145
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:03,598
I want my death sentence
commuted to life in prison.

146
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:06,701
I'm afraid I don't have
the authority to offer you that.

147
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:11,606
You will have once we show
the authorities something.

148
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,674
May I?

149
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:36,163
Photographs of my art macabre

150
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,432
can still be seen
on the Internet

151
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,434
if one knows where to look,

152
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,504
and then used
to replicate my work.

153
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:46,608
So, the suspect could be
literally anyone.

154
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:49,343
No, not anyone.

155
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,044
The preservative
was a match.

156
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:53,113
Your formula, it was
sealed by court order.

157
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,182
It was never released
to the public.

158
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,652
So, this copycat,
he knows far more
than he should.

159
00:16:57,685 --> 00:17:02,389
Maybe it was someone
that you knew from your past,
someone that you confided in?

160
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:07,060
Could you leave
the file with me tonight?

161
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:09,296
I'd like to study it in detail.

162
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:13,333
I'll have Dr. Loesch
bring it to your cell.

163
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,435
In the meantime,
I have prepared some questions

164
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:17,170
that might help refresh
your memory.

165
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:20,374
That won't be necessary.
My memory is absolute.

166
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:23,043
But I would like your help
with a different matter.

167
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:26,681
-What is that?
-My art supplies.

168
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:30,685
They've been in
the Sheriff's Department storage
since my arrest.

169
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:34,656
I want them back with permission
to use them in my cell.

170
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:39,326
I must have
my art supplies, Mary,
or we can't proceed.

171
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,395
It's nonnegotiable.

172
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:47,401
Reminder that my hour of death
is fast approaching.

173
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,468
Thank you, Mary.

174
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:53,373
I'll see
what I can do.

175
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,811
Should you find anything,
Dr. Loesch will provide you
access to a phone.

176
00:17:56,844 --> 00:18:02,316
Mary, are you familiar with
the archangel Samael?

177
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:05,118
Yes, but I outgrew fairy tales.

178
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,798
And then along comes Mary.

179
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:30,277
He knew I was coming.
Someone on the inside must
be feeding him information.

180
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,280
What about our case?
Is he willing to help?

181
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:36,149
- Uh...
- What does he want?

182
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:37,819
He wants his sentence commuted.

183
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:40,555
-No damn way!
-Okay. He might know something.

184
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:42,189
Don't be naive, Mary.

185
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,925
He only said what
you wanted to hear.

186
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,327
Naive? Wow.
That was uncalled for.
I'm sorry.

187
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:49,864
But two weeks from now
that bastard's gonna fry,

188
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:52,366
and the world'll be
a better place for it.

189
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,429
I think we both
could use a coffee.

190
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,331
I'm okay. Thank you.

191
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:07,008
Sir, step away from
the vehicle right now.

192
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,710
I'm not gonna ask you again.

193
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:20,454
Mind unlocking it?
Yeah. Sorry.

194
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:22,857
Thank you.

195
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:52,720
Not a single print,
trace of DNA.

196
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:55,857
Same as the others
five years ago.

197
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:19,680
<i>Yeah, what is it?</i>

198
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:23,017
Tell Dr. Loesch I need to
speak with Detective Kelly.

199
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:33,761
You have two minutes.

200
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:46,741
Did you see that tattoo
on her left shoulder?

201
00:21:46,774 --> 00:21:48,743
The Sigil of Baphomet?

202
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:52,947
An inverted pentagram with
a goat's head at the center.

203
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,783
It represents carnality,
I think.

204
00:21:57,018 --> 00:21:58,920
You're familiar
with that stuff?

205
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:02,924
Well, I'm familiar
with The Piper,

206
00:22:02,957 --> 00:22:07,494
a brothel five minutes' drive
from where her body was found.

207
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:11,431
All the women working there
have tattoos just like that.

208
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,433
She was a hooker, Mary.

209
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,674
Detective Kelly.

210
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:23,110
Thank you for reuniting me
with my old paints, Mary.

211
00:22:23,144 --> 00:22:24,579
Very much appreciated.

212
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,848
Prove it.

213
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:28,481
Oh, I will.

214
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:32,452
But first I want to make
something perfectly clear.

215
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:37,490
Whatever help I provide
is for you and only for you.

216
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:42,763
Not for your police friends,
nor anybody else. Understood?

217
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:44,999
Understood.

218
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:51,105
Now, the copycat's
latest victim,
the crucified girl...

219
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:56,510
Do you happen to know
if the coroner
clipped her wings?

220
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:58,579
Why would that matter?

221
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:00,681
Because she's
going to need them.

222
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:02,049
Why does she need them?

223
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:06,520
Mr. Lefeuvre,
why does she need her wings?

224
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:09,924
For her journey
into the afterlife.

225
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:26,874
Forget something?

226
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:29,076
Yeah, I need to look
at these wings.

227
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:36,117
What exactly did he say?

228
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,020
Something about the wings.
He implied that they
were important somehow.

229
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:46,160
There's something in here.
I think it's glued.

230
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:54,702
What the hell is that?

231
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:56,938
It's a nail polish brush.

232
00:23:58,172 --> 00:24:00,041
This shade
was discontinued years ago.

233
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,009
You could tell all that
just by looking at the cap?

234
00:24:02,043 --> 00:24:04,779
No, this is the exact shade
that I wore in high school.

235
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:06,881
My father hated me
for wearing it.

236
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:08,783
I'm gonna need
to take this, okay?

237
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:11,652
That brush was in there, sir.

238
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:13,988
And you can confirm this?

239
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:16,023
Still wondering about
the coroner, though.

240
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:19,026
Dr. Reed?
What-- What about him?

241
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,496
Well, are you aware of him
ever coming into contact
with The Artist, sir?

242
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:27,568
What if he knew the brush
was there all along
and never said anything?

243
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,905
Wh-Why would he do something
like that, Jake?

244
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:33,641
I've known Dr. Reed
for five years.

245
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:37,178
Look, I think it's
important that we just
keep The Artist talking,

246
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:40,147
and I honestly think
that we need to consider
his commutation request.

247
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:41,849
We're gonna need
more than a brush

248
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:43,951
to approach the governor,
Detective.

249
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:48,189
But if you feel you're onto
something, you keep going.

250
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:50,224
You'll get all
the support you need.

251
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:54,528
How about we focus on
catching the copycat
so they both can fry?

252
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,705
Hey, can I ask you
something?

253
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:08,876
The night The Artist
was arrested,
what happened, exactly?

254
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:17,718
Jake and Zeke were pursuing
at a high rate of speed
when Jake lost control.

255
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:20,021
They crashed.
Vehicle caught on fire.

256
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:22,556
Jake made it out.
Zeke died at the scene.

257
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:27,328
Jake suffered bad burns
on his left arm,

258
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,764
but he still
made the arrest, Mary.

259
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:31,192
<i>Hello, Jacob.</i>

260
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:34,862
I suppose a firm handshake's
out of the question.

261
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,299
I'd rather shake hands
with the devil.

262
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,402
Careful what you wish for.

263
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:44,672
Do you realize how
batshit crazy you are?

264
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:48,142
This is such misguided
thinking, Jacob,

265
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:52,379
especially from a person
who's witnessed
what you've witnessed.

266
00:26:52,413 --> 00:26:56,150
It's a pity, really.
I do take comfort
in one thing.

267
00:26:56,183 --> 00:27:00,187
Not only did Zeke
finally see the light,

268
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:02,189
he became it.

269
00:27:02,223 --> 00:27:03,724
Oh, yeah?

270
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:05,392
I didn't lay
a finger on him.

271
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:08,329
Your partner set
himself ablaze.

272
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:12,900
Jake.

273
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,805
Jake.

274
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:20,241
Put your firearm down.

275
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:22,943
Now.

276
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,988
We need to have a talk.

277
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:29,376
Victim ID'd
as Desiree Washburne, age 26.

278
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,779
Affiliated with the sex trade,
by any chance?

279
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:34,415
Says she worked for several
online escort agencies.

280
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:36,350
Three dead in three days.

281
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,752
I really want
to hurt this guy, Mary.

282
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:54,134
<i>I need you to back up.</i>

283
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,488
Sniffer dogs
are working the woods,

284
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:17,091
and Dutch is on
foot and tire print duty.

285
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:19,860
So, we should have
entry and exit points
in no time.

286
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:23,130
Unless this guy
can fly. Yeah.

287
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:25,032
He's getting reckless.

288
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:27,201
No. More confident.

289
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:45,919
There's something
underneath the nail.

290
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:48,922
Uh, do you have
some tweezers?

291
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:11,412
This is a needle
from an antique compass.

292
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:15,049
My partner Zeke
had a compass
just like it.

293
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:18,553
Never saw him without it, Mary.
Not once.

294
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:23,090
But the day after he died,
his wife came to collect
his effects.

295
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:26,160
No sign of the compass.

296
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,029
Well, you don't
actually think that--

297
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:31,465
First your nail polish,
now Zeke's needle.

298
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:33,467
You tell me.

299
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,621
How do you know
it's not an act?

300
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:56,490
He's suffered episodes
like this since childhood.

301
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,461
Do you have any theories
as to the cause?

302
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:05,232
At age ten,
he sustained a blood clot
on the brain after a fall.

303
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:07,501
He spent the next two years
in a wheelchair.

304
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:10,538
The damaged regions
of his brain

305
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:13,307
were likely reaggravated
at the time of his capture,

306
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,110
due to use of excessive force
by Detective Doyle.

307
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:19,313
No, I read the arrest report.
There's no mention
of any misconduct by Jake.

308
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:23,083
It also doesn't mention
he spent the next three months
in therapy afterwards.

309
00:31:23,117 --> 00:31:26,554
-Lefeuvre?
-No. Jake Doyle.

310
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:28,623
I thought you knew.

311
00:31:36,196 --> 00:31:38,098
<i>Before he lit the match,</i>

312
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:40,300
Zeke looked right at me
and laughed.

313
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:45,406
And that laugh, a sound
I never wanna hear again,
it was pure evil.

314
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,374
A pure evil laugh?

315
00:31:47,408 --> 00:31:51,546
Jacob, do you hear yourself?
An evil laugh?

316
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:56,383
I sincerely hope you did not put
this into your incident report,

317
00:31:56,417 --> 00:32:00,588
because it makes you sound
unreservedly insane.

Detective Kelly.

326
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:34,481
You knew. You knew about
the nail polish brush.

327
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,719
Nail polish brush?

328
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:41,321
-You told me to go and look,
and you said--
-I told you where to look.

329
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:46,059
-Not what you would find.
-So, why the nail polish brush,
Mr. Lefeuvre?

330
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,494
What is the significance?

331
00:33:50,565 --> 00:33:53,835
Because it's something
I used to do.

332
00:33:53,868 --> 00:33:58,573
I would place
a personal possession
next to each body,

333
00:33:58,606 --> 00:34:01,341
and forensics
missed it every time.

334
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,778
It's an ancient burial practice.

335
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:09,784
An object to accompany
the dead on their journey
to the afterlife.

336
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:14,054
But you don't believe
in the afterlife, do you, Mary?

337
00:34:17,592 --> 00:34:22,530
You know, a petition
to commute your sentence
has been drafted.

338
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:24,766
I just doubt it ever reaches
the governor's desk.

339
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:31,606
By the way, Mary,
you were correct.

340
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,642
The copycat does know
my work well.

341
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:38,680
Maybe too well,
which makes me wonder...

342
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:42,215
If truth be told, Mary,

343
00:34:43,317 --> 00:34:46,621
I have a number of admirers.

344
00:34:46,654 --> 00:34:52,359
And I may have even
met some of them
before my arrest.

345
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:57,532
And I may have even divulged
some of my secrets to them.

346
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,907
So, it is possible that
among these letters,
there is a likely suspect.

347
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,711
I'm very happy to come
help you look at those.

348
00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:13,615
Nobody looks through
my correspondence except me.

349
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:16,784
I'll need your word on that.

350
00:35:16,818 --> 00:35:19,821
You have my word on that.

351
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:24,792
Mr. Lefeuvre,
what do you know about
a missing compass?

352
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,596
I know nothing about
a compass, Mary.

353
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,767
A needle for one
was found under the fingernail
of the last victim.

354
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,501
Photograph?

355
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,704
Hmm.

356
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:51,653
So, a compass
missing its needle...

357
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:56,323
or a needle
missing its compass.

358
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:59,727
And what might that represent
metaphorically, Mary?

359
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:01,529
What?

360
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:04,565
Disorientation.

361
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,803
Or a lost soul
struggling to find their way.

362
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:15,442
Will you excuse me?

363
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:18,478
I have some reading to do.

364
00:37:15,503 --> 00:37:17,237
I don't wanna die.

365
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,364
<i>About your dad...</i>

366
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:46,634
<i>They're giving him</i>
<i>one week, maybe.</i>

367
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:49,771
<i>You don't believe</i>
<i>in the afterlife, do you, Mary?</i>

368
00:37:49,804 --> 00:37:53,306
<i>Or a lost soul</i>
<i>struggling to find their way.</i>

369
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:19,534
Hey. Ooh.
What's that smell?

370
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:22,804
-Smells like there's
something burning.
-Oh, that's the sage.

371
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:25,540
The sage?

372
00:38:34,682 --> 00:38:35,683
Thank you.

373
00:38:36,684 --> 00:38:39,587
Um, so what's with the sage?

374
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,723
Expels negative thought.

375
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:49,030
Dale, I'm not getting into it
about my dad again, okay?

376
00:38:49,063 --> 00:38:51,464
I wasn't gonna say
a word about your dad.

377
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:55,536
Sorry.
I just-- The case
has been getting to me.

378
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:03,343
Let's eat.

379
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:25,398
For my next demonstration,
I'm going to need
a volunteer.

380
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:29,537
Ah.

381
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:32,840
Please. Sit down.

382
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:36,911
Please, sit.

383
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:39,412
Sit.

384
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:46,888
Now, you are going to be
what I wish you to be.

385
00:40:17,118 --> 00:40:19,987
Hey, are you sure it's okay
we're not taking
that trip to Rome?

386
00:40:22,156 --> 00:40:25,626
Yeah. I know your work
takes priority.

387
00:40:28,596 --> 00:40:29,630
What was that?

388
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:12,773
- Sure it was the same guy?
- Yeah, I'm positive.
He was--

389
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:15,710
He just seemed really crazed,
like he was under
the influence of something.

390
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:17,745
Could this be the killer
that you're after?

391
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:31,158
He struck again.

392
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,794
Get some rest, Mary.

393
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:39,767
I'm coming with you.

394
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:23,210
The museum security says
five hours are missing
from the dome security footage.

395
00:42:24,078 --> 00:42:27,782
He took his time with this one.
Wonder why.

396
00:42:37,892 --> 00:42:39,260
Jake.

397
00:42:40,928 --> 00:42:42,363
Is that what I think it is?

398
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:44,899
Yeah. It's Zeke's compass,
all right.

399
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:47,101
Don't move it.

400
00:42:52,373 --> 00:42:54,108
This is Doyle.

401
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:55,176
Evidence room.

402
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,232
What is that? German?

403
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:53,400
Uh, Dutch, I believe.

404
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:59,173
<i>"Het helse landschap."</i>
"The inferno landscape."

405
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:02,009
Wait. What?

406
00:44:02,877 --> 00:44:04,712
You okay?

407
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:09,183
Before Zeke died,
he texted me this.

408
00:44:11,852 --> 00:44:13,787
It's an art book.

409
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:18,726
"The newly discovered work
by 16th-century master
Hieronymus Bosch."

410
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:21,195
It says it's out of print.

411
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:23,230
I know where
we could find a copy.

412
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,702
<i>The Inferno Landscape.</i>

413
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:33,307
I read it a couple of times,
but never figured out
what Zeke was trying to tell me.

414
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:48,222
Samael.

415
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:53,794
The Artist mentioned that name.

416
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:57,131
Samael was a fallen angel
cast into hell.

417
00:44:57,164 --> 00:45:00,834
But he's better known as--
Lucifer, yeah.
I'm familiar with the story.

418
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,151
We thank Father Linares
for his testimony.

419
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:19,954
The exorcisms
he participated in

420
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:22,823
during his final
mission to Ethiopia

421
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:28,295
provide us with
a better understanding
of the phenomena of possession.

422
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:36,737
-What are we doing here?
-I want you to meet
an old friend.

423
00:45:37,505 --> 00:45:39,206
Enjoy.

424
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:48,048
Thank you, Father.
Allow me to introduce
my partner, Mary Kelly.

425
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:53,320
Father, I was wondering
if you could look into
Mary's etheric aura.

426
00:45:53,354 --> 00:45:55,189
I believe she may
need a healing.

427
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:56,390
What are you talking about?

428
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:00,928
She's been exposed
to a negative force,

429
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:03,364
the evil man
at the center of
our investigation.

430
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:04,532
My God, I'm out of here.

431
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:06,967
Mary, wait.

432
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:08,269
What was that back there?

433
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:09,571
Look, I was only
trying to help.

434
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:11,438
You're trying
to help how?

435
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:13,807
Look, I've been studying,
learning new things.

436
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:15,376
I want to share 'em with you.

437
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,278
I thought you were different
than Dutch and all the others.

438
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:19,213
But I guess I was wrong.
No, no, no.

439
00:46:19,246 --> 00:46:23,150
I am trying to catch
a serial killer.
You're wasting our time.

440
00:46:23,183 --> 00:46:25,185
Jake, you can believe
whatever you want.

441
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:27,321
What you read in your own time,
that's your business.

442
00:46:27,354 --> 00:46:30,057
But when superstition starts
interfering with the work,
then I have a problem.

443
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,527
If you want to be reassigned,
just ask the sheriff.

444
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,297
-I'm sure Dutch would
welcome you with open arms--
-That is not what I'm saying.

445
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:41,035
Jake, this is not healthy,
especially for you, okay?

446
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:48,008
Hey, car's this way.
I'm taking a walk.

447
00:46:48,442 --> 00:46:49,443
Mary.

448
00:48:21,569 --> 00:48:23,470
Is he all right?

449
00:48:23,505 --> 00:48:26,641
Pulse and breathing are normal.
He's fine.

450
00:48:26,674 --> 00:48:29,410
Yeah, you filed
numerous reports
to extend his stay.

451
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:32,246
And I've read your report
on his supposed self-harm.

452
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:34,148
It's a little overstated,
in my opinion.

453
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:36,383
Do you have a medical degree?

454
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:38,586
Just a master's
in common sense.

455
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,689
Do you want to level with me,
or should I go to
the board of directors instead?

456
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:47,529
His mind fascinates me.

457
00:48:47,562 --> 00:48:50,130
I've been studying him
ever since he arrived.

458
00:48:50,164 --> 00:48:52,700
At any rate, we both
want him here for now.

459
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:21,729
<i>Dispatch</i>
<i>controller Reynes SD751.</i>

463
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,679
Come in.

464
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:40,582
These were just
dropped off.

465
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:41,649
Thanks.

466
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:53,695
Uh, ten minutes ago, sir.

467
00:49:54,495 --> 00:49:56,798
Yeah, yeah.
I saw the photo myself.

468
00:49:56,831 --> 00:49:59,266
I forwarded them
to your private email.

469
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,539
Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:50:05,105 --> 00:50:07,074
Uh, yes.

471
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:08,810
I believe it's
our only option, actually.

472
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:11,245
I mean, look...

473
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:14,481
There's no guarantees here,
but time is not our friend.

474
00:50:15,717 --> 00:50:17,619
Of course, Governor.

475
00:50:17,652 --> 00:50:20,755
I had to inform
the governor of all our options,

476
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:24,091
including The Artist's request.

477
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:25,192
Damn it!

478
00:50:26,126 --> 00:50:27,160
You know, Jake,

479
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:28,530
maybe you ought to think about

480
00:50:28,563 --> 00:50:30,497
sitting the rest
of this one out.

481
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:33,200
Take a little break,
time for yourself.
It'd be understandable.

482
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:36,704
Look, Lieutenant Governor Diaz
doesn't match the profile
of any of the other victims.

483
00:50:36,738 --> 00:50:38,472
Are we sure that
this is our guy?

484
00:50:38,506 --> 00:50:41,308
He abandoned his truck
a couple blocks away.

485
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:43,778
Inside, we found trace amounts
of chloroform

486
00:50:43,811 --> 00:50:45,547
and the dove feathers--
all matches.

487
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,615
And then, there are these.

488
00:50:51,118 --> 00:50:56,089
Delivered to the psych institute
via courier service.
Addressed to Arnaud Lefeuvre.

489
00:50:58,191 --> 00:51:00,160
He's trying
to prove himself
to the master.

490
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:01,228
Or...

491
00:51:03,363 --> 00:51:04,732
Or is he showing off?

492
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:07,334
Boasting he can do better.

493
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:10,103
I mean,
The Artist never targeted

494
00:51:10,137 --> 00:51:12,507
such a high-profile victim
like this, Detective.

495
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,642
Regardless, I'm convinced--

496
00:51:14,676 --> 00:51:17,512
I'm convinced
they've been communicating
since the very beginning.

497
00:51:17,545 --> 00:51:21,114
Maybe using code to get past all
the inspections. I don't know.

498
00:51:21,148 --> 00:51:22,650
We're gonna know shortly,
though.

499
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:24,719
What are you talking about?

500
00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:26,621
Um, Dr. Loesch has agreed

501
00:51:26,654 --> 00:51:29,256
to, uh, help us take
a closer look.

502
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:31,358
No. I gave The Artist my word.

503
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:33,595
-I'm not gonna risk losing
his trust right now.
-He'll never know.

504
00:51:33,628 --> 00:51:35,195
Sure. Yeah.

505
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:59,520
No, please!

506
00:51:59,554 --> 00:52:00,755
<i>No!</i>

507
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:38,593
What are you doing?

508
00:52:41,228 --> 00:52:42,429
Couldn't sleep.

509
00:52:59,446 --> 00:53:01,749
Your commutation order,
signed by the governor.

510
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:03,718
Effective
under one condition:

511
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:06,219
Lieutenant Governor Diaz
must be found alive.

512
00:53:06,253 --> 00:53:08,790
-What is this?
-Medical checkup.

513
00:53:21,334 --> 00:53:22,937
Bullshit.

514
00:53:39,787 --> 00:53:41,522
You have 45 minutes.

515
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:42,757
Yeah, that's plenty.

516
00:54:10,383 --> 00:54:12,319
Something familiar
about that mug.

517
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:14,387
Stay on task, Detective.

518
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:55,462
He struck again.
Hmm.

519
00:54:55,495 --> 00:55:00,868
I'm revisiting
a childhood favorite.

520
00:55:00,902 --> 00:55:04,539
The <i>Ecstasy of Santa Teresa.</i>
Bernini.

521
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:07,474
By the way,
your friends were here.

522
00:55:07,508 --> 00:55:10,945
-It wasn't my idea.
-And they left empty-handed.

523
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:12,880
I tried
to stop them.
I...

524
00:55:12,914 --> 00:55:14,982
Do you remember
I told you, Mary,

525
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:17,384
that I would help you
but not them?

526
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:26,694
Oh, I took all my letters
and burned them

527
00:55:26,727 --> 00:55:28,996
and flushed the ashes
down the toilet.

528
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:38,773
But not before
committing them to memory.

529
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:43,978
Mr. Lefeuvre, please.

530
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,646
Tell me what you remember.

531
00:55:46,379 --> 00:55:48,816
You tell me
something first, Mary.

532
00:55:49,382 --> 00:55:51,786
You tell me if you believe

533
00:55:51,819 --> 00:55:55,089
that a man who is free
inside his own mind

534
00:55:55,122 --> 00:55:59,760
can truly be confined
behind the bars of a prison.

535
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,699
I don't follow.

536
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:11,105
The sketch.

537
00:56:24,785 --> 00:56:27,154
Boy, let's go.

538
00:56:27,188 --> 00:56:28,388
Come here.

539
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,758
My two o'clock's here.

540
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:35,696
Keep quiet.

541
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:59,013
-What are you doing?
-What the hell did
I tell ya, boy?

542
00:58:00,648 --> 00:58:02,049
Why did you do that?

543
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:04,085
No more religious shit!
Stop!

544
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:07,121
-Ain't nothing
but brainwashing.
-Stop!

545
00:58:07,154 --> 00:58:10,791
I won't tolerate it.
But I like
the old masters' style.

546
00:58:10,825 --> 00:58:14,795
You wanna draw something,
draw a dog or a real
live person, for once!

547
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:31,012
In the subsequent
two years,

548
00:58:32,246 --> 00:58:35,149
I was confined
to a wheelchair.

549
00:58:36,117 --> 00:58:37,284
But...

550
00:58:40,054 --> 00:58:44,091
Jake, you know
all about that, don't you?

551
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:46,227
Jake!

552
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,295
<i>Come out, come out</i>
<i>wherever you are.</i>

553
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:58,105
Mr. Lefeuvre,
I am sure your childhood
was very difficult,

554
00:58:58,139 --> 00:59:00,274
but time is of
the essence right now.

555
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:03,177
I need you to talk to me
about the copycat.

556
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,245
Please.

557
00:59:05,012 --> 00:59:07,982
I'm nearly
out of sculpting clay.

558
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:12,653
I'll replenish that.
Please talk to me
about the copycat.

559
00:59:15,956 --> 00:59:18,726
The gentleman you seek

560
00:59:18,759 --> 00:59:21,595
is a forger
of Renaissance paintings,

561
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:23,798
primarily religious in theme.

562
00:59:23,831 --> 00:59:28,669
I used to frequent
a quaint little antique store
called Langdon & Sons.

563
00:59:28,702 --> 00:59:31,072
And they,
more than occasionally,

564
00:59:31,105 --> 00:59:34,608
displayed some of
his counterfeits there, Mary.

565
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:18,152
We're not open yet.

566
01:00:18,185 --> 01:00:20,054
We're not customers.

567
01:00:20,087 --> 01:00:22,756
-Well, you just can't
barge in here---
-Without a warrant?

568
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:36,804
Jake.

569
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,210
What about it?
When The Artist referenced
a painting, he made a...

570
01:00:43,244 --> 01:00:44,912
Who painted this?

571
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,848
He wished to remain anonymous.

572
01:00:47,882 --> 01:00:51,051
I paid him in cash
and I never saw him again.

573
01:00:51,085 --> 01:00:53,087
We're gonna need
to seize it as evidence.

574
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,199
Hey, when did you get
a search warrant?

575
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:08,736
I didn't.
I always keep a blank one handy.

576
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:11,205
No one ever
reads them.

577
01:01:17,745 --> 01:01:20,281
If you knock on
the devil's door, he'll answer.

578
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:22,049
It's the freak who
broke into my house!

579
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:25,252
Mary, wait!

580
01:01:28,022 --> 01:01:29,056
Wait!

581
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:59,286
You should've
listened to me, Mary!

582
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:03,457
Put your hands above your head.

583
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:05,159
-It's too late now, Mary.
-Back off!

584
01:02:05,192 --> 01:02:08,095
-I will shoot. I will shoot.
-Pull that trigger, Mary!

585
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:10,364
You don't have the guts
to pull that trigger!

586
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:12,399
I tried to warn you.

587
01:02:14,868 --> 01:02:16,136
No!

588
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:26,981
Javier Salazar,
the man who assaulted you,

589
01:02:27,014 --> 01:02:30,050
was employed at the institute
until last year.

590
01:02:30,084 --> 01:02:32,119
Worked there as a nurse.

591
01:02:32,152 --> 01:02:35,356
We're comparing his DNA
with the salivary DNA
found on the envelope

592
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:38,526
that contained
Lieutenant Governor Diaz's
photos.

593
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,963
What we know already, he was
in daily direct contact
with The Artist.

594
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:46,233
He was the RN in charge
of drug administration.

595
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:48,902
I've already checked
Salazar's record.

596
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:51,171
He was let go
due to his mental condition.

597
01:02:51,205 --> 01:02:53,140
Acute bipolarism,
according to Dr. Loesch.

598
01:02:53,173 --> 01:02:56,243
Look, he sounds psychotic,
so it's really hard to believe

599
01:02:56,277 --> 01:02:58,479
that he's capable
of such elaborate murders.

600
01:02:58,513 --> 01:03:00,814
We won't know for sure
until the DNA comes back,

601
01:03:00,848 --> 01:03:03,050
but I'm pretty damn confident
he was our guy, Mary.

602
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,821
We still have
a missing woman, sir.

603
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:10,525
The lab's running
soil traces
on Salazar's shoes.

604
01:03:10,558 --> 01:03:12,960
We want to pinpoint
exactly where he's been.

605
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:16,330
Any results on that painting?

606
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:35,416
There.

607
01:03:37,151 --> 01:03:39,953
Thumb. Must have brushed
the wet paint.

608
01:03:44,526 --> 01:03:47,127
I offered Zeke
a full confession,

609
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:49,196
and all I asked for
in return

610
01:03:49,229 --> 01:03:51,599
was for him to sit
for his portrait.

611
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:54,536
In fact, I would like
to make the same offer to you.

612
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:58,272
Of course,
I'm perfectly capable
of drawing from memory.

613
01:03:58,305 --> 01:04:00,441
Would you care
to sit for me?

614
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:11,018
Got a print on the painting,
Detective.

615
01:04:11,051 --> 01:04:13,153
Did you run it through AFIS,
confirming it's Salazar's?

616
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:15,055
Belongs to a woman, actually.

617
01:04:15,089 --> 01:04:18,926
We had her print on file
from a prostitution arrest
years ago.

618
01:04:18,959 --> 01:04:21,328
Name and address?
It's all in there, Detective.

619
01:04:22,296 --> 01:04:23,931
Hey.
What's going on?

620
01:04:23,964 --> 01:04:25,466
I'll bring you
up to speed en route.

621
01:04:25,499 --> 01:04:27,134
Take some backup.

622
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:46,213
You might want to see this.

623
01:05:59,527 --> 01:06:02,630
No, it can't be her.
This body's been here
for far too long.

624
01:06:02,664 --> 01:06:05,767
This level of desiccation
would take years.

625
01:06:08,068 --> 01:06:10,672
He must have been testing
the preservative on her.

626
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:13,207
Turned this whole apartment
into an art studio

627
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,442
to measure the rate
of decomposition.

628
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:23,484
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.

629
01:06:23,518 --> 01:06:25,152
Poison?

630
01:06:25,185 --> 01:06:27,354
It's probably ricin
extracted from castor beans.

631
01:06:27,387 --> 01:06:30,424
Same toxin he used
on the other girls.

632
01:06:30,457 --> 01:06:32,594
A single drop
can kill a horse.

633
01:06:37,765 --> 01:06:40,535
So, the Bosch
wasn't a Bosch at all,

634
01:06:40,568 --> 01:06:43,705
but a forgery
painted right here.

635
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,215
Gotta be crawling
with Salazar's DNA.

636
01:06:55,249 --> 01:06:56,684
I don't think so.

637
01:07:00,487 --> 01:07:04,124
Welcome to
The Artist's home, Jake.

638
01:07:05,325 --> 01:07:07,294
He's playing games with us.

639
01:07:09,162 --> 01:07:11,198
He turned his own mother
into a guinea pig.

640
01:07:16,738 --> 01:07:18,706
Salazar's DNA--

641
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:21,074
Not a match.

642
01:07:56,644 --> 01:08:00,147
You knew that painting would
take us to the apartment,

643
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,215
and you wanted us
to find your mother.

644
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:06,521
-Why?
-Because I wanted you to
understand who I truly am.

645
01:08:06,554 --> 01:08:09,724
I have read
every single public record

646
01:08:09,757 --> 01:08:12,627
with your name on it,
including the court cases.

647
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:15,429
I have a very good grasp
on who you are.

648
01:08:15,462 --> 01:08:18,600
Did you ever think there may
be truths about me, Mary,

649
01:08:18,633 --> 01:08:21,536
that are not contained
in those files?

650
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:24,404
This all began when
I was working on a piece

651
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:26,406
called
<i>The Inferno Landscape.</i>

652
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,610
And then I heard a voice,

653
01:08:28,643 --> 01:08:31,746
and that was the voice
of the archangel Samael.

654
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:33,447
Why am I listening to this?

655
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,618
And that voice opened
my ears and my eyes

656
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:38,720
to who I really am.

657
01:08:40,922 --> 01:08:43,357
You've given me nothing
on the copycat.

658
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:45,158
I'll let the governor know.

659
01:08:45,192 --> 01:08:48,428
Too bad for you.
I can tell you exactly
where to find him.

660
01:08:49,396 --> 01:08:51,198
Why should I believe you?

661
01:08:51,231 --> 01:08:52,867
What choice do you have?

662
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,871
By the time I finish,
you'll have his exact address.

663
01:08:56,904 --> 01:08:58,305
I promise you.

664
01:08:58,973 --> 01:09:00,608
Finish what?

665
01:09:00,642 --> 01:09:01,676
Sculpting.

666
01:09:02,977 --> 01:09:04,244
Sculpting you.

667
01:09:05,412 --> 01:09:07,548
You are a sick man.

668
01:09:07,582 --> 01:09:09,584
Because you don't
realize something.

669
01:09:09,617 --> 01:09:12,854
If the lieutenant governor dies,
you're going to the chair.

670
01:09:15,623 --> 01:09:17,357
And you don't care.

671
01:09:18,392 --> 01:09:19,961
What are you doing?

672
01:09:19,994 --> 01:09:21,228
Waiting.

673
01:09:22,864 --> 01:09:24,899
You can't be serious
right now.

674
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:27,300
Deathly.

675
01:09:29,804 --> 01:09:31,438
Make yourself comfortable.

676
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:35,442
If you want that address.

677
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:44,585
Here's the deal.
You have ten minutes
and not a second more.

678
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:47,655
At the end of those ten minutes,
you're giving me the address.

679
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:50,323
Agreed. Shall we?

680
01:10:00,968 --> 01:10:04,639
The human form
is a divine work

681
01:10:04,672 --> 01:10:06,908
of grace and proportion,

682
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:09,544
but the same cannot
be said, however,

683
01:10:09,577 --> 01:10:11,411
<i>for the human mind,</i>

684
01:10:12,312 --> 01:10:15,482
<i>which is weak and corruptible.</i>

685
01:10:15,516 --> 01:10:18,553
To create a sculpture
is to solve a mystery.

686
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:23,323
Every contour
a destination,

687
01:10:23,356 --> 01:10:25,459
every gaze a road map,

688
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:29,630
every expression and hollow

689
01:10:30,297 --> 01:10:32,800
the hidden address
of the soul.

690
01:10:33,935 --> 01:10:37,705
Did you know, Mary,
that when I first
glimpse a person,

691
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:40,942
their story is already
revealed to me?

692
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:45,345
And that yours is
the tale of a young woman

693
01:10:45,378 --> 01:10:49,416
plagued by terrible scars
from her childhood.

694
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:51,919
We all have old wounds.

695
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:57,525
Wounds are
the trademark of warriors,
wouldn't you agree?

696
01:10:59,627 --> 01:11:02,262
And God could have
healed your wounds.

697
01:11:03,698 --> 01:11:06,801
But you turn your back
on him. Why, Mary?

698
01:11:12,907 --> 01:11:14,876
My father.

699
01:11:14,909 --> 01:11:17,310
A man you haven't seen
in many years,

700
01:11:18,478 --> 01:11:21,582
who you still, in fact,
refuse to see.

701
01:11:21,616 --> 01:11:25,285
And all he wants to do
is to be able to say
goodbye to you.

702
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:32,459
You're not guessing anymore.
How do you know that?

703
01:11:32,492 --> 01:11:34,729
Why won't you see him, Mary?

704
01:11:36,097 --> 01:11:39,801
-You don't know
what he put me through.
-What did he put you through?

705
01:11:39,834 --> 01:11:42,770
Did he abuse you
as my mother
abused me?

706
01:11:42,804 --> 01:11:44,437
No, no.

707
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:46,808
You and I
are not the same.

708
01:11:47,608 --> 01:11:50,011
That man,
he never touched me. He...

709
01:11:51,879 --> 01:11:54,481
He would put his hand
on the stove, and...

710
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:58,019
he would say, "This is what
happens to flesh in hell."

711
01:11:58,052 --> 01:11:59,987
And I couldn't stop him.

712
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:05,560
And you can smell
his burning skin?

713
01:12:07,862 --> 01:12:09,664
I still can.

714
01:12:09,697 --> 01:12:14,735
So, he made you responsible for
the torment he was suffering.

715
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:20,675
That is truly the stuff
of nightmares, Mary.

716
01:12:23,544 --> 01:12:24,979
Tell me about them.

717
01:12:27,682 --> 01:12:29,349
They begin with falling.

718
01:12:30,885 --> 01:12:32,053
Falling where?

719
01:12:35,056 --> 01:12:36,624
Into flames.

720
01:12:39,894 --> 01:12:44,665
The burning was so real
that I could still feel it
when I woke up in the morning.

721
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:47,635
Do you still have
those nightmares, Mary?

722
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:51,772
No.

723
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:56,077
The moment
I stopped believing in hell,
they went away,

724
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:58,646
and my father couldn't
scare me with them anymore.

725
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:02,116
But that made him try
all the harder,
didn't it, Mary?

726
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:05,418
<i>He said I was possessed.</i>

727
01:13:05,452 --> 01:13:09,090
That I needed help.
And that's when he started
dragging me to confession.

728
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:11,959
And that's where you
first seduced him?

729
01:13:11,993 --> 01:13:14,061
Right in
the confessional booth?

730
01:13:15,763 --> 01:13:18,933
Seduced who?
The priest who took
your confessions.

731
01:13:18,966 --> 01:13:22,570
Father Dale.
The one who now
shares your bed.

732
01:13:26,207 --> 01:13:28,609
Who are you talking to?
Who told you this?

733
01:13:28,643 --> 01:13:31,746
Do you know why he
shares your bed, Mary?

734
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:33,748
Do you?

735
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:36,449
I don't need to answer
these questions.

736
01:13:36,483 --> 01:13:38,119
Would you like me
to tell you why?

737
01:13:38,152 --> 01:13:39,186
Stop! Stop!

738
01:13:42,757 --> 01:13:44,457
We fell in love.

739
01:13:44,491 --> 01:13:45,559
Love?

740
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:49,163
You fell in love?

741
01:13:49,196 --> 01:13:51,832
He chose
a different life with me.

742
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,770
So, it was true love,
correct?

743
01:13:55,803 --> 01:13:57,004
Yes.
Uh-huh.

744
01:13:57,038 --> 01:13:59,173
And when you tell
yourself that, Mary,

745
01:13:59,206 --> 01:14:01,142
-do you believe it?
-Yes.

746
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:03,144
You actually
believe that?
Yes.

747
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:05,880
-I don't think you do.
-Yes, I do.

748
01:14:05,913 --> 01:14:09,884
Or didn't you,
in fact, do it merely
to spite your father?

749
01:14:13,788 --> 01:14:17,158
Thank you
for sitting for me, Mary.

750
01:14:19,226 --> 01:14:21,461
It's very much
appreciated.

751
01:14:22,964 --> 01:14:24,231
It's your turn.

752
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,535
The address. Now.

753
01:14:27,568 --> 01:14:31,806
The address
is 1522 Lola Court.

754
01:14:32,807 --> 01:14:34,508
Was that loud enough?

755
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:37,111
Or shall I repeat it
for your colleagues?

756
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:40,147
1522 Lola Court.
Come on, people! Let's go!

757
01:14:46,754 --> 01:14:49,890
Mary, you're
forgetting something.

758
01:14:54,128 --> 01:14:55,796
This is for you.

759
01:15:03,904 --> 01:15:06,107
And always remember,
Mary,

760
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:10,277
that the truth
is only ever found
within ourselves.

761
01:15:22,323 --> 01:15:23,724
Need a lift?

762
01:15:25,626 --> 01:15:27,294
Why didn't you go
with the others?

763
01:15:27,328 --> 01:15:30,831
I figured those apes
could handle an arrest
without me for once.

764
01:15:30,865 --> 01:15:33,034
Yeah, but it's our case.
One of us should've--

765
01:15:33,067 --> 01:15:35,736
I'd rather be here
right now.

766
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:37,271
Come on, Mary.

767
01:15:53,854 --> 01:15:55,589
Oh, my God.

768
01:15:55,623 --> 01:15:58,159
God.

769
01:16:23,317 --> 01:16:27,621
I just-- I don't understand
how he knows all those things
about my life.

770
01:16:27,655 --> 01:16:30,691
It's stuff that I've only ever
told one other person, and...

771
01:16:35,129 --> 01:16:37,965
No. No, it can't be.

772
01:16:37,998 --> 01:16:40,668
He's just putting things
in my head, right?

773
01:16:46,373 --> 01:16:49,844
"Truth is found within oneself."
That's what he said.

774
01:16:49,877 --> 01:16:51,879
Who said what?

775
01:16:57,184 --> 01:16:59,220
Wait, what are you doing?

776
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:13,033
Archibald, have you lost
your mind?

777
01:17:14,802 --> 01:17:16,203
Son of a bitch.

778
01:17:26,981 --> 01:17:29,283
-I'll be damned.
-265 Opal Street.

779
01:17:29,316 --> 01:17:32,019
It's the right address.
Do you know where this is?

780
01:17:32,052 --> 01:17:33,087
Yeah.

781
01:18:45,527 --> 01:18:47,261
Anyone home?

782
01:19:03,377 --> 01:19:05,179
What the hell
is all this?

783
01:19:06,814 --> 01:19:10,417
It's me. It's...
It's my entire life. It's--

784
01:19:16,023 --> 01:19:17,358
"Infernum."

785
01:19:18,993 --> 01:19:21,195
I-It's Latin for "hell."

786
01:19:23,998 --> 01:19:27,034
Come on, Mary.
We really need
to call this in.

787
01:19:27,067 --> 01:19:29,503
Go ahead. I'm just gonna
take a few pictures.

788
01:19:29,537 --> 01:19:31,071
I'll catch up, okay?

789
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:54,028
Car 252 to Dispatch.

790
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:03,871
<i>Hi, you've reached Dale.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

791
01:21:09,036 --> 01:21:10,471
Governor Diaz?

792
01:21:10,504 --> 01:21:12,906
Yes. Who are you?

793
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:15,242
I'm the one who's gonna
get you out of here.
Okay.

794
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:19,313
-How do you unlock this?
-The devil man. He has the key.

795
01:21:19,346 --> 01:21:21,048
-Where is he?
-He's right there.

796
01:21:37,532 --> 01:21:40,200
Step out with your hands
above your head.

797
01:21:40,234 --> 01:21:41,168
Slowly.

798
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:44,471
Mary.

799
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:51,245
Jake?

800
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:55,015
Well, yes. And no.

801
01:21:56,618 --> 01:21:59,987
I promised to help you
find the killer, Mary.

802
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:01,922
And here he is.

803
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:04,124
Jake,
what's wrong with you?

804
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:06,326
Oh, Jake's not here
right now.

805
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:11,965
No prison can hold a man
who's free inside himself.
Remember, Mary?

806
01:22:14,134 --> 01:22:15,603
Lefeuvre?

807
01:22:15,637 --> 01:22:17,438
That's right.

808
01:22:25,547 --> 01:22:29,116
You still need to hear
the rest of my story, Mary.

809
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:08,756
<i>Mother destroyed</i>
<i>all my art books,</i>

810
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:12,527
<i>forcing me to find</i>
<i>new subjects to draw.</i>

811
01:23:24,137 --> 01:23:27,642
<i>That's when I discovered</i>
<i>my power.</i>

812
01:23:27,675 --> 01:23:31,478
<i>After capturing</i>
<i>someone's likeness</i>
<i>in a drawing,</i>

813
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:38,352
<i>I can leave my own body</i>
<i>and temporarily enter theirs.</i>

814
01:23:46,493 --> 01:23:49,363
I kept it a secret
for many years,

815
01:23:49,396 --> 01:23:51,431
fearing it to be a curse.

816
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:56,604
Until the archangel Samael

817
01:23:56,638 --> 01:23:58,205
revealed it was a gift...

818
01:23:59,507 --> 01:24:01,743
...bestowed upon me

819
01:24:01,776 --> 01:24:04,311
when the spirit
entered my body.

820
01:24:06,213 --> 01:24:08,482
I was born an angel, Mary.

821
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:11,753
Angel of Death.

822
01:24:13,855 --> 01:24:16,123
Come back, come back,
come back.

823
01:24:16,156 --> 01:24:18,292
Jake, please.
Jake, come back. Please.

824
01:24:18,325 --> 01:24:19,459
No, no, no!

825
01:24:37,545 --> 01:24:39,581
I have honored the contract.

826
01:24:40,782 --> 01:24:43,116
Lieutenant governor lives.

827
01:24:44,519 --> 01:24:47,354
And the killer
will soon be dead.

828
01:24:48,221 --> 01:24:50,825
And I couldn't have done it
without you.

829
01:24:56,496 --> 01:24:58,800
Now finish the job, Mary.

830
01:24:58,833 --> 01:25:00,702
One more,

831
01:25:02,369 --> 01:25:03,638
right here.

832
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,140
Don't be afraid.

833
01:25:18,485 --> 01:25:19,787
Mary?

834
01:25:22,657 --> 01:25:23,691
Where am I?

835
01:25:29,831 --> 01:25:31,164
I'm so sorry.

836
01:25:32,734 --> 01:25:34,334
Jake, I'm so sorry.

837
01:25:36,571 --> 01:25:38,171
Jake, it was you.

838
01:25:50,852 --> 01:25:53,253
You were the copycat
the whole time.

839
01:25:56,456 --> 01:25:58,492
You gotta stop him, Mary.

840
01:26:15,275 --> 01:26:18,345
Now, you're free to join
your old partner, Jacob.

841
01:26:20,581 --> 01:26:21,883
Go.

842
01:26:28,455 --> 01:26:29,657
Go.

843
01:26:33,393 --> 01:26:34,929
<i>The city can breathe easier</i>

844
01:26:34,962 --> 01:26:38,498
<i>thanks to Detective Mary Kelly,</i>
<i>whose courageous actions</i>

845
01:26:38,533 --> 01:26:42,369
<i>ended the killing spree</i>
<i>of her former partner,</i>
<i>Jake Doyle,</i>

846
01:26:42,402 --> 01:26:44,539
<i>and saved the life</i>
<i>of Lieutenant Governor Diaz.</i>

847
01:26:44,572 --> 01:26:46,808
You, uh, wanted
to see me, sir?

848
01:26:46,841 --> 01:26:51,713
I know it's not
the happy ending
we all wanted, Detective.

849
01:26:54,015 --> 01:26:56,416
But you did save
that woman's life.

850
01:26:58,385 --> 01:27:00,655
Psychologists are saying
that Jake suffered from

851
01:27:00,688 --> 01:27:04,592
some kind of dissociative
identity-type psychosis,

852
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:07,895
possibly triggered from the--
from the first case.

853
01:27:07,929 --> 01:27:11,465
That's why he thought
he was The Artist.

854
01:27:12,967 --> 01:27:14,736
Well,
they are the experts.

855
01:27:18,005 --> 01:27:19,607
What do you think,
Mary?

856
01:27:20,508 --> 01:27:21,976
You were there that night.

857
01:27:26,914 --> 01:27:28,950
What I think won't
bring him back, sir.

858
01:27:34,689 --> 01:27:37,390
The Jake I knew
wasn't capable of this.

859
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:40,661
And I knew Jake
for a long time.

860
01:27:48,102 --> 01:27:50,671
I just can't wrap
my head around it.

861
01:27:55,475 --> 01:27:57,712
<i>Whoever believes in me</i>

862
01:27:57,745 --> 01:28:01,314
should not abide
in the darkness.

863
01:28:03,951 --> 01:28:05,653
May the Lord

864
01:28:05,686 --> 01:28:09,590
look kindly on you,

865
01:28:09,624 --> 01:28:10,925
Elias Kelly.

866
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:16,429
In the name of the Father
and the Son

867
01:28:16,463 --> 01:28:18,733
and the Holy Spirit.

868
01:28:18,766 --> 01:28:20,034
Amen.

869
01:28:29,777 --> 01:28:32,345
I'm glad
you saw your father
before he passed.

870
01:28:33,514 --> 01:28:34,849
Yeah. Me too.

871
01:28:40,955 --> 01:28:44,559
Um...
can you give me a minute?

872
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:46,694
Yeah.

873
01:28:55,036 --> 01:28:56,571
Dr. Loesch.

874
01:28:57,839 --> 01:29:01,709
Let the earth rest lightly
on him, Mary Kelly.

875
01:29:05,613 --> 01:29:07,915
Did you know my father,
Dr. Loesch?

876
01:29:07,949 --> 01:29:10,852
<i>No. I just wanted</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

877
01:29:10,885 --> 01:29:13,087
<i>No visits. No calls.</i>

878
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,956
Not even a letter,
Mary Magdalene?

879
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:20,661
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

880
01:29:20,695 --> 01:29:23,030
I missed you too, Mary.

881
01:29:25,733 --> 01:29:28,936
You never intended to kill
the lieutenant governor,
did you?

882
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:30,671
Very perceptive.

883
01:29:30,705 --> 01:29:34,542
I was only giving her boss
extra incentive to sign.

884
01:29:35,643 --> 01:29:36,744
<i>No, Mary.</i>

885
01:29:37,979 --> 01:29:40,548
It's you who's going
to be next.

886
01:29:41,682 --> 01:29:43,818
Why the games?

887
01:29:43,851 --> 01:29:46,419
You could have
just sketched a guard
and wheeled yourself out.

888
01:29:46,453 --> 01:29:48,455
You could have escaped
at any time.

889
01:29:48,488 --> 01:29:52,026
To spend the rest of my life
hunted like an animal?

890
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:53,895
I think not.

891
01:29:53,928 --> 01:29:56,130
Escape has never been
my intent, Mary.

892
01:29:56,163 --> 01:29:59,133
In fact, there couldn't be
a more ideal place for me

893
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:02,536
to continue
my necessary work.

894
01:30:04,005 --> 01:30:06,841
As I'll soon be
returning the favor

895
01:30:07,508 --> 01:30:10,678
when I purify your soul,
Mary.

896
01:30:10,711 --> 01:30:12,947
Today would have been the day.

897
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:16,751
Of my execution.
Ironic, isn't it?

898
01:30:16,784 --> 01:30:19,220
I think a little bit more
than you realize.

899
01:30:19,253 --> 01:30:21,789
And what's that
supposed to imply?

900
01:30:21,822 --> 01:30:23,991
I have a question for you.

901
01:30:24,025 --> 01:30:26,761
Did you happen
to sketch Dr. Loesch
with a black pencil?

902
01:30:26,794 --> 01:30:29,230
-I'm sorry?
-A black charcoal pencil.

903
01:30:29,263 --> 01:30:32,667
It was part of the art supplies
that were delivered
to your cell yesterday.

904
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:35,770
I think you might have
thought that they were
from some deranged fan,

905
01:30:35,803 --> 01:30:37,571
but no, they were from me.

906
01:30:37,605 --> 01:30:39,140
See, I noticed
you had this habit

907
01:30:39,173 --> 01:30:42,710
of chewing on the ends
of your pencils.

908
01:30:42,743 --> 01:30:45,780
Just added a couple drops
of your special ingredient,

909
01:30:45,813 --> 01:30:48,082
the same one that you used
on your own mother.

910
01:30:48,115 --> 01:30:49,150
You're bluffing.

911
01:30:50,851 --> 01:30:53,154
I probably should have filed it
with evidence, but...

912
01:30:54,956 --> 01:30:58,059
I guess Jake taught me
a few bad habits after all.

913
01:30:59,226 --> 01:31:00,628
Have a good day.

914
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:35,656
You know, I was
thinking about that trip
you wanted to take.

915
01:32:35,689 --> 01:32:38,125
To Rome?
Yeah, let's do it.
