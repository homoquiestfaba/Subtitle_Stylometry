You binked a gutshot straight
at Foxwoods.

185
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:24,066

188

LL, like "Lucky Lady."

189
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:30,139
Ah, okay.

190
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:31,207
I've watched you play.

191
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,341
You count cards, right?

192
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,676
I'm not that smart.

193
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:36,646
But you win,
so you count cards.

194
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,549
How do you avoid

195
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:41,584

Yet here you are.

197
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:47,657
Yeah, well,
it's a matter of degree.

198
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,192
The house doesn't mind players
who count cards.

199
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:53,095
They don't even mind players
who count cards and win.

200

- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Soda water, please.

202
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:02,471
What they don't like are players
who count cards and win big.

203
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:05,374
It's about how much you win
and how you win it.

204
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:08,177
I stick to modest goals.

205
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,346
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

206
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:12,214

I've watched you play poker,

209
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:18,688
and I wonder why you play
at such low stakes.

210
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:20,256
You're a crackerjack.

211
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:22,325
I keep to modest goals.

212
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:23,626
No, there's no reason for that.

213
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:26,362
You can get someone
to stake you... an MTT...

214
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:28,464
make seven million payout.

215
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:31,167
That's what you do...
you-you run a stable.

216
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,603
I'm always looking
for a good thoroughbred.

217
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:37,106
I can get someone
to back you 100%, on my word.

218
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:40,376
I prefer to work
under the radar.

219

223
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:56,192
you ever been to prison?

224
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:01,230
Why would you say that?

225
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:03,366
I can tell
when someone's been inside.

226
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,401
It's a gift I have.

227
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:11,140
Here's the problem
with a backer.

228
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:14,710
He puts up the money,
you split the winnings.

229
00:14:14,744 --> 00:14:16,712
That's all good,
but if you lose,

230
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:19,181
you have to pay those losses
out of future winnings.

231
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:20,650
Right? That only makes sense.

232
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:23,653
And slowly, you build weight.

233
00:14:23,686 --> 00:14:26,522
You go to any poker website,
look up the top ten winners...

234
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:30,393
millions in earnings...
50% of them are underwater.

235
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:32,763
Swamped in debt
they'll never repay.

236
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:36,298
If you don't play for money,
why do you play at all?

237
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:39,468
It passes the time.

238
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:43,172
So, Bill...

239
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,810

some time with me?

with your name and number on it.

358
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:46,209
You remember Major John Gordo?

359
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:50,079
Of course,
he's not a major anymore.

360
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,048
He just uses that title.

361
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:55,184
What are you talking about?

362
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:58,187
PFC William Tillich.

363
00:24:58,221 --> 00:25:00,089
Isn't that your name?

364
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,592
I've done my research.

365
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,827
I know your case.

366
00:25:07,997 --> 00:25:09,866
BOTH:
Thank you.

367
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,370
- Who are you?
- Cirk Baufort.

368
00:25:14,404 --> 00:25:16,072
Cirk with a "C."

369
00:25:16,105 --> 00:25:18,308
My father was Roger Baufort.

370
00:25:18,341 --> 00:25:22,078
Gordo trained my father in the
arts of enhanced interrogation.

371
00:25:23,446 --> 00:25:26,316
Roger Baufort?
That name doesn't ring a bell.

372
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:28,418
Gordo was at Abu Ghraib.

373
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:30,920
As a private contractor.

374
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:33,923
My father, he visited him there.

375
00:25:33,956 --> 00:25:36,059
Is this story going anywhere?

376
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:37,927
The beauty of his scheme
was that Gordo,

377
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,029
once he became
a private contractor,

378
00:25:40,063 --> 00:25:43,232
he couldn't be prosecuted for
crimes not on American soil.

379
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:45,234
But my father...

380
00:25:45,268 --> 00:25:47,203
wasn't so lucky.

381
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:51,207
He was dishonorably discharged,
got addicted to oxycodone.

382
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,242
He'd been injured.
He drank heavily.

383
00:25:53,276 --> 00:25:56,212
He beat my mother.
He beat me.

384
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:58,348
My mother left one day
without saying a word.

385
00:25:58,381 --> 00:26:00,450
Without a suitcase. Just...

386
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:04,954
That left only me to beat.

387
00:26:06,155 --> 00:26:08,024
Until he shot himself.

388
00:26:08,057 --> 00:26:09,859
That was four years ago.

389
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:14,130
So I decided I'd just
get into it.

390
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:16,933
Investigate it for myself,
find out what really happened.

391
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:19,035
Set things straight.

392
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:21,371
What does your mother say?

393
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:24,240
(scoffs softly)
She made her choice.

394
00:26:24,273 --> 00:26:26,376
Do you know where she is?

395
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:28,211
No.

396
00:26:30,713 --> 00:26:33,149
And how am I involved in this?

397
00:26:33,182 --> 00:26:35,418
Well, there were
a handful of soldiers

398
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:38,121
that were bad apples,
who were punished,

399
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:39,422
but those who are
really responsible

400
00:26:39,455 --> 00:26:41,691
are still walking around
out there,

401
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:43,526
giving lectures at conventions,

402
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,428
getting honorary degrees.

403
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:47,397
The apples weren't bad.

404
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,465
The barrel they came from
was bad.

405
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,306
You know, when I recognized you
at John Gordo's seminar,

406
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,008
I recognized you instantly.

407
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:02,011
I thought to myself,

408
00:27:02,044 --> 00:27:06,015
"Here's a man who might want
a piece of what I'm gonna do."

♪ Ooh-ooh... ♪

540
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,218
WILLIAM:
Well, here she is.

541
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,020
Madam.

542
00:35:30,053 --> 00:35:32,521
Join us.

543
00:35:32,554 --> 00:35:33,924
La Linda, I'd like
to introduce you

544
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:35,926
to the young man
formerly known as Cirk Baufort.

545
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:38,028
Now we just call him the Kid.

546
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:39,628
Yep. That's Cirk with a "C."

547
00:35:39,662 --> 00:35:40,864
- Yeah.
- Pleased to meet you, Kid.

548
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:42,766
King of sports book, the Kid is.

549
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:44,733
Yesterday, played two games,
hit 'em both on a double pop.

550
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,069
Oh. Give me some of your luck.

551
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,938
(William chuckles)

552
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,773
Uh, La Linda and I just have
something we want to discuss.

553
00:35:49,806 --> 00:35:50,941
- Maybe...
- Yeah.

554
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:52,508
I'll, uh,
give the slots a whirl.

555
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,576
All right.
Bet small, lose small.

556
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,815
He's a good kid.

557
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,885
What was this thing
you wanted to talk about?

558
00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:06,588
Uh, well, I may want
to build up a nest egg,

559
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:09,960
and, uh, to do that,
I need a backer.

560
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:12,062
Well, that's a dramatic turn.

561
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,597
You woke something in me.

562
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,803
I don't know.

563
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:21,838
It's the Kid. He needs help.

564
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:23,840
And money will do that?

565
00:36:23,873 --> 00:36:26,009
He's got debts.

566
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:28,711
So, where do we start?

567
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:31,047
Well, jump on one
of these WSOP tours.

568
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:33,615
They got an event every week.

569
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,684
And you'll come up fast
if you're willing to travel.

570
00:36:35,718 --> 00:36:37,754
I am.

571
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:39,756
We'll start
on the East Coast for now.

572
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:41,124
Tease 'em.

573
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,093
Vegas?

574
00:36:43,126 --> 00:36:45,128
That's where the money is.

575
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,130
Do I have to meet the backer?

576
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,732
For some people,
it's an ego thing.

577
00:36:49,766 --> 00:36:51,768
- Others don't care.
- Mm-hmm.

578
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:53,870
I'll find something
that suits you.

579
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:56,039
(William takes deep breath)

580
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:01,710
I build my nest egg, I bail.

581
00:37:02,812 --> 00:37:04,881
One year max, then I'm out.

582
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:10,586
I wish I could believe that.

583
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,789
Believe.

584
00:37:15,992 --> 00:37:17,927
(chuckles softly)

585
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:19,728
I'm too old for this.

586
00:37:19,763 --> 00:37:21,798
- Mwah. Bye.
- Bye.

587
00:37:30,173 --> 00:37:33,109
The other day, you asked me,

588
00:37:33,143 --> 00:37:36,079
"What was the greatest hand
of poker ever played?"

589
00:37:37,781 --> 00:37:40,917
And I can only speak
for what I have seen,

590
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,652
and this...

591
00:37:43,685 --> 00:37:46,056
is the best hand I ever saw.

592
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:49,859
2012, Indian casino in Iowa.

593
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,595
Blackbird Bend, Omaha Nation.

594
00:37:53,629 --> 00:37:55,697
10K tournament.

595
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,768
Goldie... Asian player,
wore a lot of gold...

596
00:37:58,802 --> 00:38:00,970
and Alex Karesco,
WSOP champion.

597
00:38:01,004 --> 00:38:02,806
You may have heard of him.

598
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,942
Alex has pocket queens,

599
00:38:05,975 --> 00:38:08,211
clubs and diamonds.

600
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,781
Goldie has
eight, nine of diamonds.

601
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:14,784
How'd you do that?

602
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:16,019
Practice. I was in a place

603
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:18,054
where I had a lot of time
on my hands.

604
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,621
Now the flop.

605
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:21,224
Ten of spades,

606
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,760
jack of diamonds,
queen of hearts.

607
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:26,830
There's blood in the water.

608
00:38:27,997 --> 00:38:30,100
Both players think
they're ahead.

609
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,769
It goes check, raise,

610
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:35,038
reraise, re-reraise,

611
00:38:35,071 --> 00:38:36,840
call.

612
00:38:36,873 --> 00:38:38,842
Alex and Goldie head-to-head.

613
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:40,877
Now the turn.

614
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,712
Ten of diamonds. Now...

615
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:46,116
there is only one card
that gets Goldie out.

616
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:47,817
There's a two percent chance

617
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:49,751
the river will come
the seven of diamonds.

618
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:52,255
Alex has a 98% chance of winning

619
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,023
with queens full of tens.

620
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:55,992
Goldie looks at the damage.

621
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:58,128
He doesn't even have
a pot-sized bet left behind.

622
00:38:58,161 --> 00:39:01,831
Makes this little sucking sound
that the Japanese do.

623
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:03,800
(inhales sharply)

624
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:06,035
Then he goes all in.

625
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:07,937
Alex calls.

626
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,906
Now the river.

627
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,675
Seven of diamonds.

628
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:16,212
Straight flush beats
a full house. Goldie wins.

629
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:17,914
You saw that game?

630
00:39:17,947 --> 00:39:19,782
Haven't been to Iowa since.

631
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,885
Could you top us off, please?

632
00:39:30,894 --> 00:39:32,862
So this, um...

633
00:39:34,797 --> 00:39:37,867
...this plan you have

634
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:40,069
about Major John Gordo...

635
00:39:40,103 --> 00:39:42,205
you given it more thought?

636
00:39:43,306 --> 00:39:45,041
He's all nails.

637
00:39:45,074 --> 00:39:47,110
You're not.

638
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:49,245
He's right out of fucking
<i>Call of Duty.</i>

639
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:51,181
(chuckles softly)

640
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:53,682
How you gonna do that?

641
00:39:54,817 --> 00:39:56,753
Well...

642
00:39:56,786 --> 00:39:58,888
there would need to be
a tranquilizer.

643
00:39:58,922 --> 00:40:01,791
Ketamine, combined with Telazol.

644
00:40:01,824 --> 00:40:04,160
It can be administered
by a dart pistol.

645
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:07,096
Where'd you find out about this?

646
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,199
- The Internet.
- And you have it?

647
00:40:09,232 --> 00:40:10,934
Just the ketamine.

648
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:13,002
But it's amazing how easy
the stuff is to get.

649
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,804
I mean, I ordered it on a lark.

650
00:40:14,837 --> 00:40:16,239
Three days later, it arrived.

651
00:40:17,774 --> 00:40:19,809
This isn't
very well thought out.

652
00:40:20,977 --> 00:40:23,846
And that's why I need a partner.

653
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,817
Somebody with experience,
somebody with expertise.

654
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,852
And motive.

655
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,754
A strong guy.

656
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:33,323
A guy like you.

657
00:40:37,293 --> 00:40:39,162
Let's...

658
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:42,999
roll back your scenario
for a moment.

659
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:45,535
You've located John Gordo.

660
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,971
You shot him with a dart.

661
00:40:48,004 --> 00:40:49,872
He's gaga.

662
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,874
What next?

663
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,280
Strip him naked.

664
00:40:57,313 --> 00:40:59,983
Put a hood over his head.

665
00:41:00,016 --> 00:41:02,952
One of those green
military sandbags.

666
00:41:02,986 --> 00:41:05,154
You can find them on eBay.

667
00:41:06,155 --> 00:41:07,991
Handcuff him.

668
00:41:08,024 --> 00:41:10,793
Hang him from the ceiling,
keep him from sleeping.

669
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:16,165
Make him try to jerk off
while I hit him in the legs.

670
00:41:18,368 --> 00:41:20,336
Did your father tell you
about this?

671
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,939
No, he never talked about it.

672
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:26,276
He kept it all inside.

673
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:28,244
He beat you.

674
00:41:29,212 --> 00:41:30,847
That's in the past.

675
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,115
The body remembers.

676
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:34,117
It stores it all.

677
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,087
Do you want to hear about it?

678
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,056
Would that interest you?

679
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,126
- What?
- You know what.

680
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:45,194
You're dying to hear.

681
00:41:55,872 --> 00:41:58,041
The noise.

682
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:01,411
The smell.

683
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:06,382
Feces, urine,

684
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:09,218
oil, explosives,

685
00:42:09,252 --> 00:42:12,889
bleach, sweat, smoke.

686
00:42:12,922 --> 00:42:15,425
All day, every day.

687
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:17,427
Sand spiders, camel spiders,

688
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,996
ants as big as cockroaches.

689
00:42:20,029 --> 00:42:22,398
The heat, the fear,

690
00:42:22,432 --> 00:42:24,934
the adrenaline jack, mortars.

691
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:26,402
The sheer noise of it.

692
00:42:26,436 --> 00:42:29,038
And blood.

693
00:42:29,072 --> 00:42:32,275
And the only way to survive
was to rise above.

694
00:42:32,308 --> 00:42:34,243
Rise and laugh.

695
00:42:34,277 --> 00:42:36,946
Surf the craziness.

696
00:42:36,979 --> 00:42:40,316
To see a grown man shit
and piss on himself.

697
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,451
(chuckles)

698
00:42:41,484 --> 00:42:43,186
Sing the song, man.

699
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:45,988
The noise, the fucking noise.

700
00:42:48,057 --> 00:42:49,926
The noise.

701
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,662
We were all just trapped
in there,

702
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:57,133
in the same shit,
sh-sh... shithole.

703
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,235
(shuddering)

704
00:42:59,268 --> 00:43:01,237
Them and us.

705
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,310
And am I trying to justify
what we did?

706
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,382
No.

707
00:43:16,285 --> 00:43:18,154
Nothing...

708
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:23,025
Nothing can justify
what we did.

709
00:43:26,295 --> 00:43:28,431
Your father understood that.

710
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:32,902
If you were there,
you could understand.

711
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:37,006
Otherwise, there's no...

712
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:39,041
understanding.

872

873

He tilted.

874
00:52:42,052 --> 00:52:43,253
Which direction?

875
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:44,921
Violence.

876
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:47,623
But he had some good friends
who liked me,

877
00:52:47,656 --> 00:52:50,060
and they were gamblers,

878
00:52:50,093 --> 00:52:52,829

in that direction.

879
00:52:52,862 --> 00:52:56,866
And... they said I have
very good people skills.

880
00:52:58,101 --> 00:53:00,971

01:05:13,402 --> 01:05:15,604
So, how long's it been
since you got laid?

1076
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:23,345
How long has it been
since you've seen your mother?

1077
01:05:23,379 --> 01:05:25,281
I wouldn't know
where to find her.

1078
01:05:25,314 --> 01:05:27,017
That's bullshit.

1079
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:29,351
What business is it
of yours, anyway?

1080
01:05:30,352 --> 01:05:32,655
- You remember her?
- Sure.

1081
01:05:32,688 --> 01:05:35,624
Yeah? She reach out to you?

1082
01:05:35,658 --> 01:05:37,693
She try and contact you?

1083
01:05:40,463 --> 01:05:43,265
I'll make you a deal, Kid.

1084
01:05:43,299 --> 01:05:46,235
You go see your mother,
and I'll fucking get laid.

1085
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:57,313
About earlier:
I don't like prisons.

1086
01:05:57,346 --> 01:05:58,481
(scoffs)

1087
01:05:58,514 --> 01:06:00,349
Even seeing them
on the highway here,

1088
01:06:00,382 --> 01:06:03,753
looking at it and...
you realize,

1089
01:06:03,787 --> 01:06:06,255
"Oh, my God, that's a prison."

1090
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:12,461
My dad used to send my mom
letters from Bagram,

1091
01:06:12,495 --> 01:06:14,663
and she'd cry.

1092
01:06:24,406 --> 01:06:26,709
There's something
quite similar in poker.

1093
01:06:27,743 --> 01:06:29,612
You know the phrase "tilt"?

1094
01:06:29,645 --> 01:06:31,313
Yeah.

1095
01:06:31,347 --> 01:06:32,816
When a player gets
caught up in winning,

1096
01:06:32,849 --> 01:06:35,484
plays outside his zone.

1097
01:06:35,518 --> 01:06:37,686
Just like in pinball.

1098
01:06:39,956 --> 01:06:42,893
And there's something similar
in interrogations.

1099
01:06:42,926 --> 01:06:45,528
It's called "force drift."

1100
01:06:45,561 --> 01:06:48,731
It happens when
the interrogator applies

1101
01:06:48,765 --> 01:06:52,434
more and more force to
the prisoner with less results.

1102
01:06:53,837 --> 01:06:55,839
The interrogator
becomes intoxicated

1103
01:06:55,872 --> 01:06:58,474
by frustration and power.

1104
01:07:00,376 --> 01:07:02,813
Any man can tilt.

1105
01:07:02,846 --> 01:07:05,414
I can tilt.

1106
01:07:05,447 --> 01:07:07,516
Your father can tilt.

1107
01:07:08,751 --> 01:07:10,854
You can tilt.

1108
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:18,762
I said ride with me.

1109
01:07:18,795 --> 01:07:20,864

- Mm.

1379
01:25:04,526 --> 01:25:08,497

$5,000 in credit card debt.

1382
01:25:13,937 --> 01:25:17,640

let's throw in

1384
01:25:19,642 --> 01:25:21,211
another ten grand pocket money.

1385
01:25:21,244 --> 01:25:25,648
That's 150 grand, cash,
tax free.

1386
01:25:25,681 --> 01:25:28,584
All that's yours
on one condition.

1387

1388
01:25:42,766 --> 01:25:46,435
Go see your mother.

I spoke to her.

1392
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:00,817
I didn't tell her
who I was, of course.

01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:03,652
Go visit her.

1394
01:26:03,686 --> 01:26:05,621
Forgive her.

1395
01:26:05,654 --> 01:26:07,489

1396
01:26:07,523 --> 01:26:09,025
Clear up her debt.

1397
01:26:09,059 --> 01:26:12,028
Tell her about
your college plans.

1398
01:26:12,062 --> 01:26:14,730
Then put her on the phone
with me.

1399
01:26:15,999 --> 01:26:18,835
I want to hear her say
these things.

1400

Yes.

1403
01:26:41,958 --> 01:26:44,493
And if I don't?

1404
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:49,899
This is not a proposal
you can afford to reject.

1405
01:26:52,035 --> 01:26:54,703
And if you cheat me,

1406
01:26:54,737 --> 01:26:56,739

01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,916
I don't like celebrity gambling.

1409
01:27:08,051 --> 01:27:10,686
