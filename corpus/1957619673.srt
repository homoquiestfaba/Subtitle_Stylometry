1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:03,036
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,053
(waves crashing)

3
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,425
(seagulls chirping)

4
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:38,138
(dramatic choral music)

5
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,821
(birds chirping)

6
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,647
- [Woman] It's got to be up here somewhere.

7
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,750
- You sure we didn't miss the turn?

8
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,851
- Yeah, I'm sure.

9
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,838
(birds chirping)

10
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,876
- Well, it's not Buckingham Palace.

11
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,379
- It's the last time I travel so far for a job.

12
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,949
We won't get back 'til night fall.

13
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,817
- Well, at least the pay is worth it.

14
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,493
You know, it's not a bad place to live.

15
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,495
I wonder what it costs.

16
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,997
- If you have to ask,

17
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,732
you probably can't afford it.

18
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,572
(ominous music)

19
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,403
Along came a spider and sat down beside her.

20
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,640
- I tell you what, I think, I'll do upstairs.

21
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,308
- Have fun.

22
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,570
(birds chirping)

23
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,948
(suspenseful music swelling)

24
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,717
(rat screeching)

25
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,889
- Go on.

26
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,557
Get away, go on!

27
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,792
Go on.

28
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,027
Go on, get out.

29
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,302
(dramatic music)

30
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,085
(woman humming)

31
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,623
(dramatic choral music)

32
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,928
- Gee, you almost put a heart cross ways in me.

33
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,838
(rats screeching)

34
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,245
(woman gasping)

35
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,150
(suspenseful music)

36
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,204
- Go on.

37
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,307
Get outta here.

38
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,012
Get.

39
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,416
(rats screeching loudly)

40
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,388
(woman screaming)

41
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,526
(woman screaming)

42
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:37,196
(suspenseful choral music)

43
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:42,969
(rats screeching erratically)

44
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,972
(suspenseful music)

45
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,944
- Kathleen!

46
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,716
(Kathleen whimpering) For god sakes what happened?

47
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,884
It's okay.

48
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:58,918
It's okay.

49
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,852
- The rats.

50
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:01,821
The rats.

51
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:02,655
- Rats? - The rats!

52
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,190
- There are no rats.

53
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,391
Are you alright?

54
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,692
Shh, it's okay.

55
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:07,960
Everything's all right.

56
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,264
- There were rats everywhere.

57
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,065
- It's okay, you're alright now.

58
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,867
Kathleen, it's okay now.

59
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,137
- Oh, my god.

60
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,573
(heavy breathing)

61
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,574
- I need some air.

62
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,508
- Kathleen!

63
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,180
(suspenseful music)

64
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,295
(engine sputtering) (Kathleen gasping)

65
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,129
- Come on!

66
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,831
(dramatic choral music)

67
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,835
(overlapping voices whispering)

68
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,874
(overlapping voices whispering)

69
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:00,146
(car engine sputtering)

70
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,915
(overlapping voices whispering)

71
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:06,752
(suspenseful chords striking)

72
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:28,741
(overlapping voices whispering)

73
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,744
(suspenseful music)

74
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,717
(Kathleen screaming)

75
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,052
- Kathleen.

76
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:22,361
- I can't believe we made it, but here we are, Ireland.

77
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,131
Glen Abby Manor will be getting some new tenants.

78
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,800
Let me take you on a little tour.

79
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,771
And who is that gruesome fellow?

80
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,773
Oh, boy we're gonna have to get rid of him.

81
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,174
(game beeping)

82
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,209
But we know who this beautiful girl is, don't we?

83
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,414
Hey, Brey, can you turn that thing off a second, huh?

84
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,415
Say hi, to your daddy.

85
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,282
- Hi, daddy.

86
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,587
- Now kiss me a kiss, huh?

87
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,055
Hmm, you happy to be here?

88
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,222
- Yes. - Good.

89
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,095
Oh, the lovely Maura, unpacking.

90
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,396
- Will you put that camera down,

91
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,131
and help me with this stuff.

92
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,933
We've got to get this van back soon.

93
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,271
- Okay, okay, just gonna get

94
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,273
a couple of shots in the house.

95
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,011
Look at those cute little buns.

96
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,112
- Will, stop it!

97
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,815
- Yes, I think they'll find her.

98
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,052
(gentle music)

99
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,923
(tense music)

100
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,411
Whoa, hey!

101
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,679
How'd you beat me up here?

102
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,319
Hey, Brey.

103
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:55,755
Brey.

104
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,291
(camera beeping)

105
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,626
You alright?

106
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,262
(ominous music)

107
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,967
- Can I have this room, daddy?

108
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,036
- Yeah, sure, but did you check out all the other rooms?

109
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,537
- I want this one.

110
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,374
- Okay, you like this room.

111
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,308
You got this room.

112
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,279
(tense music)

113
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:25,885
Hey.

114
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,089
Yeah.

115
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,691
We are officially in.

116
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,594
- Yay.

117
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,136
- Hmm, can we try that bed out yet?

118
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,675
- Will, I think, maybe we should sleep

119
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,410
in separate bedrooms for a while.

120
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,147
- Oh, come on.

121
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,550
- Oh, it's just I don't know.

122
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,055
- What's Aubrey gonna think.

123
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,724
- Aubrey knows more about us than you think.

124
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,893
- Well, maybe we don't need to remind her.

125
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,662
I mean, she's got enough to adjust to as it is.

126
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,464
She's got new friends, a new school.

127
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,999
Be nice if she had a stable

128
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,801
family environment to come home to.

129
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,940
- You didn't think much about that before, did you?

130
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,575
- I thought we were okay on this.

131
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,277
It's over.

132
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,113
I made a mistake, big mistake.

133
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,015
- Yeah.

134
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,253
It's just gonna take me a while.

135
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:36,689
- Yeah.

136
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,524
Okay.

137
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,562
Oh, geez, come here.

138
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,396
I'm sorry.

139
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,238
- I'm gonna go make dinner.

140
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,407
- All right.

141
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,613
(door creaking)

142
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,383
(wine cork popping) I think, we should make

143
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,386
a little toast to Eliza Laundrigan

144
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,188
for keeping the house in the family,

145
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,524
and to our family.

146
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,160
- Yeah, to our family.

147
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,730
- There you go, yeah.

148
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,067
- I wish I knew more about her.

149
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,469
I mean, she was just this name we heard

150
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,670
when we were growing up.

151
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,174
(furniture scraping)

152
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,008
- What was that?

153
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,611
(furniture scraping)

154
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,214
(loud banging)

155
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,183
- Will.

156
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:39,451
- Stay.

157
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,788
(soft knocking on door)

158
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,395
Can I help you?

159
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,063
- Hi, you must be the new tenant.

160
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,166
- Yeah, you know, we just started our dinner--

161
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,635
- I'm Father Seamus from Holy Cross Church.

162
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,172
- What can I do for ya?

163
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,241
- I came by to see if everything was all right.

164
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,609
- Oh, yeah everything's fine.

165
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,511
We're just doing fine, thank you.

166
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,514
- Ah, you must be a Laundrigan.

167
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,249
- Oh, yes, I am.

168
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,218
Actually, I'm a South now.

169
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,152
My name is Maura.

170
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,386
This is my husband, Will,

171
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,322
and our daughter, Aubrey.

172
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,090
- I'm Father Seamus.

173
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,425
I'm sorry to call at this hour.

174
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,227
But I was a very good friend of Eliza's.

175
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,195
And out of deference to her I came by to,

176
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:27,533
well, to welcome you and to bless the house at her request.

177
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,101
She was a very religious woman.

178
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,970
- Well, thank you.

179
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:32,805
- May I come in?

180
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,542
- Sure, come on in.

181
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,376
- Please do.

182
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,348
(throat clearing)

183
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,184
- Hear us, Holy Lord,

184
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,653
and dane to send your angel from Heaven

185
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,923
to guard, protect, cherish, visit, and defend

186
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,825
all who dwell in this home.

187
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,927
- What's he doing, daddy?

188
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,830
- He's blessing the house.

189
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,368
- Why?

190
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,070
- It's good luck.

191
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,539
(priest speaking in foreign language)

192
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,374
- Amen.

193
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,444
Well, thank you.

194
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,815
I believe, she would've wanted it.

195
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,250
- Did you know her well, Father?

196
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,052
- She attended the church for years.

197
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,289
Ah, dear lady.

198
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,357
It was sad to see her decline so rapidly.

199
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,559
- Yes, it must have been.

200
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:31,096
- Anyway, this house is too big

201
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,698
for one person to live alone in.

202
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,636
It needs to be filled with the laughter of children, right?

203
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,140
- Did you grow up in Ireland, Mister?

204
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,075
- Uh, that's Father.

205
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,211
- Why, yes, I did.

206
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,947
I've lived here all my life.

207
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,685
- Have you ever seen a leprechaun?

208
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:57,289
- A leprechaun, well, now let me tell ya.

209
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,292
They have been known to roam the land.

210
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,696
But they like it very much if ya leave out

211
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,864
a bowl of milk for them during the night.

212
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,668
- Can I leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?

213
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,071
- Sure.

214
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,944
- Well, have you had dinner, Father?

215
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,846
We've got plenty.

216
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,548
- Yeah, we would love you to stay.

217
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,151
- Thank you for the offer, but I really have to go.

218
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,387
- Well, okay.

219
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,256
- I'll walk you out.

220
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,966
- Well, I hope everything works out for you,

221
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,502
and that you find happiness in your new home.

222
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,336
- Thanks.

223
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,473
- Well, goodnight. - Bye.

224
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,841
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

225
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:57,850
Was a little weird, isn't it?

226
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,684
- Huh. - Huh.

227
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,087
- [Mom] Awe.

228
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,323
- Look, mommy, for the leprechauns.

229
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,359
- Hey, that's right for the leprechauns, okay.

230
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,328
- Go put it outside, sweetheart.

231
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,201
(dramatic music)

232
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,704
(owl hooting)

233
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:27,179
(faint voice whispering)

234
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,683
(rat screeching) (tense chord striking)

235
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,253
(loud banging)

236
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,625
(dramatic music)

237
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,753
Are you playing tricks on me?

238
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,921
- What?

239
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,855
- Well, it's not gonna work, you know.

240
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,957
'Cause I'm smarter than that.

241
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,926
And I'm not cleaning up that rat, Will.

242
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,496
- What is with this thing?

243
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,765
- What are you watching?

244
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,136
- This is the tape that I made when we first moved in.

245
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,172
- Hi, daddy.

246
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,043
- What the hell is that?

247
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,911
- That's what I'd like to know.

248
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,347
I mean, it's insane.

249
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,548
I never took the tape out.

250
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,217
It's the same tape that was in the camera.

251
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,352
I transferred it to the video.

252
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,820
And it's the craziest thing.

253
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,855
What is all this?

254
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,526
- Were you just upstairs?

255
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,528
- No, why?

256
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,631
- You weren't in the bedroom

257
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,632
when you threw some books around?

258
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,402
- No, maybe it was Aubrey.

259
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,504
- No, Aubrey's asleep.

260
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,008
That's what I need, some sleep.

261
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,210
I think, I'm seeing things.

262
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,512
- Yeah, I'm gonna join you in a minute.

263
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,113
I'll just see if I can figure out

264
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,382
what's going on with this thing.

265
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,650
- [Maura] Okay.

266
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,490
(suspenseful music)

267
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,230
(birds chirping)

268
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,907
- Hello there, little girl.

269
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,008
- Hello.

270
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,176
- Are your parents in?

271
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,947
- Daddy, there's a man out here!

272
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:42,948
- All right.

273
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,186
Hey, what can I do for ya?

274
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,288
- Hi, there I'm here with the new water heater.

275
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,756
- Oh, good, come on in.

276
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,162
Yeah, my wife will be happy to see you.

277
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,697
- [Aubrey] Look, daddy, he drank it.

278
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,032
- Yeah, come on.

279
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,201
- Ah!

280
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,605
(metal clanking)

281
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,740
- You need a hand with that?

282
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,376
- Yeah, sure it seems to be stuck.

283
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,448
- Here, give it a shot with that.

284
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,352
(birds chirping)

285
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,921
(gentle music)

286
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,993
- [Colleen] Hi, what's your name?

287
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:29,795
- Aubrey.

288
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,998
- [Colleen] Hi, Aubrey, I'm Colleen.

289
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:33,999
Do you want to play?

290
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,901
- Sure.

291
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,537
- [Plumber] Yeah, that got it.

292
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,938
(metal clanking)

293
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,674
(dramatic music)

294
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,724
- [Colleen] Do you like hide and seek?

295
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,507
(light switch flickering)

296
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,113
(dramatic music)

297
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,023
(soft sighing)

298
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,524
- Your water heater's here. - Oh, good.

299
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,360
Honey, were you just fooling with the power?

300
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,194
- Nope. - You didn't see

301
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,696
the power go on and off.

302
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,531
I just had a bulb break.

303
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,465
- No, I didn't see anything.

304
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,600
Hey, look at this?

305
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,136
- What is it?

306
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,170
- I don't know.

307
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,072
I found it in the cellar.

308
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,473
Kind of weird, huh?

309
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,474
Look at that.

310
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,642
- Yeah. - Look it.

311
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,311
- Look we have a problem with the power.

312
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,147
- I'll check the breaker.

313
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,683
(gentle music)

314
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,626
(ominous music)

315
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,404
- Aubrey, did you do this?

316
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,575
Now don't play games with me, honey.

317
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,110
- I didn't do anything, mommy.

318
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,846
- Well, if you didn't do it, then who did?

319
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,980
- Maybe it was Colleen.

320
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,651
- And who is Colleen?

321
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,153
(tense music)

322
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,932
(computer beeping)

323
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,943
(computer beeping erratically)

324
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,277
- Geez, please, don't do this to me.

325
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,746
Don't do this to me!

326
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:01,546
What is this?

327
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,016
(ghostly voice whispering softly)

328
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:08,186
(tense ominous music)

329
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:15,894
Huh, come on.

330
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,566
(ghostly voice whispering softly)

331
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,804
(tense ominous music)

332
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,408
(computer beeping)

333
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,242
Come on.

334
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,012
- Did you hear something?

335
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,047
- No, I didn't hear anything.

336
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,950
(computer beeping)

337
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,086
I don't believe this.

338
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,654
You know, this is crazy.

339
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,689
It's like everything got broken in the move.

340
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,558
Now the computer's all screwed up.

341
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:48,994
- Well, a lot of strange things

342
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,595
have been going on around here,

343
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:55,267
weird sounds, things moving, your videotape.

344
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,637
- What are you saying, Maura?

345
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,641
- I don't know what I'm saying.

346
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,676
Do you agree with me?

347
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,583
- Yeah, I'd say that some weird things have happened.

348
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,819
- Well, what do you think it is?

349
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,454
- I don't know.

350
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,255
I mean, it's an old house.

351
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,994
- Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy, after all.

352
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,298
- There's gotta be an explanation.

353
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,532
- Maybe we should call someone.

354
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,533
(shaver buzzing) - Oh, yeah.

355
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,434
Who we gonna call?

356
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,007
- I don't know.

357
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:41,513
Someone who knows about this kind of stuff.

358
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,681
- Oh, come on.

359
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,719
- Hey, what about being open minded?

360
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,087
- Hey, just 'cause I have an open mind,

361
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,355
doesn't mean I'm gonna pay some

362
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,357
snake oil peddler to come in here

363
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,893
and shake a voodoo stick around the house.

364
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,362
- Voodoo stick it's nothing like that.

365
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,697
(Aubrey screaming)

366
00:24:58,697 --> 00:24:59,931
(suspenseful music)

367
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,499
- Okay, sweetie, mom and daddy's here.

368
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,068
(monster growling)

369
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,237
(suspenseful music)

370
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,472
(Aubrey screaming)

371
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,007
- Aubrey! - What the hell was that?

372
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,310
- Sweetie. - It was a monster!

373
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,881
(suspenseful choral music)

374
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,628
(computer beeping erratically)

375
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,507
(dramatic music)

376
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,714
- Okay, baby, stay here!

377
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,548
Stay right here!

378
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,653
- It's gonna hurt us, mommy.

379
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,954
- No, it's not, baby.

380
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,022
No, it's not.

381
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,459
(dramatic music)

382
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,636
(wind whistling softly)

383
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,518
(cows braying)

384
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,787
- [Will] Nice place.

385
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,923
- Yeah, he must do pretty well.

386
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,359
Hey, you sure you're okay with this?

387
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,728
- Yeah, we'll give it a shout.

388
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,163
See what he says.

389
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,409
- And did it harm either one of you or your daughter?

390
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,944
- [Maura] No.

391
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,648
- Did it leave any tracks or footprints of any kind?

392
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,451
- No, no, it just disappeared, literally.

393
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,420
- I know this must sound crazy to you.

394
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,989
- Not at all.

395
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,225
You may have an elemental inhabiting your house.

396
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,593
- I'm sorry.

397
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,662
- It's a kind of primitive spirit or demon

398
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,831
that takes on a physical form.

399
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,500
We're just trying to put together all the evidence.

400
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,769
- Yeah, that's what we're here for.

401
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,472
- I may be able to detect the presence of something.

402
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,940
- And what do you do?

403
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,409
What do you got some kind of meter or something?

404
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,211
- I prefer to work as a clairvoyant.

405
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,914
- Oh, that's good.

406
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,821
(birds squawking)

407
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,992
(machine crackling)

408
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,695
(tense music)

409
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,130
- I'm feeling something here?

410
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,266
- Ooh, he feels something.

411
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,139
- Seems to be moving.

412
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,340
(birds chirping)

413
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,677
(dramatic choral music)

414
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,457
(machine crackling)

415
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,959
- I'm getting a reading.

416
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,229
- Uh, this was Aubrey's room.

417
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,330
She stays with us now.

418
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,202
(dramatic music)

419
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,376
(machine crackling)

420
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,317
- Yes, there is definitely something in this room.

421
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,665
(camera bulb flashing)

422
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:57,001
(dramatic choral music)

423
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,206
(machine crackling)

424
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:41,546
(ominous chords striking)

425
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,351
(suspenseful music)

426
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,960
(clairvoyant breathing heavily)

427
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,379
- [Will] Is guy alright?

428
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,117
(suspenseful music)

429
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,131
- [Amy] Take a look at this.

430
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,469
(machine beeping)

431
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:53,451
(clairvoyant gasping)

432
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,719
(woman screaming)

433
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:55,520
- Oh, no.

434
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,191
- Geez. - You okay?

435
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,128
What happened?

436
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,830
- I don't know.

437
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,764
My god.

438
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,534
(birds chirping)

439
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,247
(suspenseful music)

440
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,483
(Aubrey screaming)

441
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:26,317
Aubrey!

442
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,989
(Aubrey screaming)

443
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:37,929
Oh, Aubrey!

444
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,364
Baby, are you okay?

445
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,566
- Baby, what happened? - Baby, what happened?

446
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,867
Baby! - My god!

447
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,435
Go on get her in the house.

448
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,304
Get her inside come on.

449
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,886
- It looks like we have some animal hairs in here.

450
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,690
Perhaps some kind of rodent.

451
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,393
- So is that what this is all about?

452
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,663
Somebody's got a problem with us living here.

453
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,065
- Oh, not someone, some thing.

454
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,769
I've never felt presence as strong before.

455
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,339
- Okay, so we have a presence.

456
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,940
What do we do about it?

457
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,310
- If we have a troubled spirit,

458
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,211
we have to find out why it's troubled.

459
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,115
- Town records are coming up now.

460
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,618
It seems as though some ancestors of yours,

461
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,355
James and Mary Ann Laundrigan, built the house in 1863.

462
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,958
I'll see if I can dig up anymore information on them.

463
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,896
- Do you have any other physical evidence I could look at?

464
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,264
- Not really, no.

465
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:51,135
- Honey, the thing.

466
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,538
- Oh, yeah.

467
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:56,941
Yeah, I found this.

468
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,621
- Where did you find this?

469
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,556
- [Will] In the cellar.

470
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,957
It was nailed to the wall.

471
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,197
- Seems to be some faint lettering on it.

472
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,433
Runic alphabet, I think.

473
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,203
- Jackpot.

474
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,204
- What did you find?

475
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,673
- I did a cross search of

476
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,975
death certificates with this address.

477
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:34,345
James and Mary Ann Laundrigan they had a daughter.

478
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,884
Right here it says James died 1882 pneumonia.

479
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,820
Mary Ann dies September the following year, suicide.

480
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,157
- Suicide.

481
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,760
How?

482
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,961
- It doesn't say.

483
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,029
But that's not what interests me.

484
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,565
There's no death certificate for the daughter anywhere.

485
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,467
- Do you have the name?

486
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,302
(computer clicking)

487
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,103
- Colleen.

488
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,573
- Colleen.

489
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,842
(dramatic music)

490
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:08,146
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?

491
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:08,980
- Yes.

492
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,215
- What friend?

493
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,051
- Can you talk to her?

494
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,119
- She talks to me.

495
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:25,830
- What is this, a friend of yours from school, honey?

496
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,265
- It's an I imaginary friend.

497
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,768
- Ah.

498
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,538
(dramatic music)

499
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,612
- What does Colleen say to you?

500
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,080
- She says she's lonely.

501
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,683
- [Shea] And where is she?

502
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:46,517
- She's here.

503
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:54,892
- Where is she now?

504
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,694
- She's hiding.

505
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:00,865
- Can you take me to her?

506
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,671
- She's down.

507
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:07,939
- Down.

508
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,207
Honey, what do you mean down?

509
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,008
- Do you mean she's sad?

510
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:14,645
- She's down.

511
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:16,681
Help her!

512
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,650
- Why don't you take me to her?

513
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,389
(dramatic music)

514
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,091
Hmm, okay.

515
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,428
Okay.

516
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,398
Well, we seem to be getting somewhere.

517
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,467
- Wait a minute.

518
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,337
She's down.

519
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,007
Where'd you find that metal again?

520
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,041
- Down in the cellar.

521
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,594
- Colleen.

522
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,631
(dramatic choral music)

523
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,465
Colleen.

524
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,071
Colleen.

525
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,475
We're here to help you.

526
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,344
Can you talk to us?

527
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,482
If you're lonely, we can help you?

528
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,621
Colleen, can you tell me where you are?

529
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,629
We're here to help you.

530
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,402
Can you show yourself to us, Colleen?

531
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,304
- Where's she going?

532
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,138
- [Shea] Colleen.

533
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,640
- Aubrey.

534
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:55,680
Aubrey.

535
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,048
Aubrey.

536
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,756
(suspenseful music)

537
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,238
- There's something in here.

538
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:22,473
- What?

539
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:23,941
- There's something behind this wall.

540
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,345
- Well, what is it?

541
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:33,718
- I'm not sure.

542
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,089
But trust me this wall has to come down.

543
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:47,098
- Hey.

544
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,800
Let's stay here.

545
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,014
(suspenseful music)

546
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:06,450
(Will breathing heavily)

547
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,843
(dramatic choral music)

548
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:33,911
- Oh, my god.

549
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,019
Colleen.

550
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:47,858
Oh, Colleen.

551
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,134
(somber music)

552
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:07,311
(priest speaking in foreign language)

553
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,649
(sea gulls chirping)

554
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,588
- May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.

555
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,625
- Poor little girl.

556
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,563
- While hopefully the old set up and order is at an end.

557
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:27,832
And everyone, including your family,

558
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,834
will find peace at last.

559
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:30,668
- Thank you.

560
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:36,006
And really we thank all of you

561
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,708
for everything you've done for us.

562
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,579
- And we'd like to have you over for dinner

563
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,915
sort of give closure to this whole thing.

564
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:48,986
You too, Father.

565
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,857
- Please, it would mean a lot to us.

566
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,793
- Thank you.

567
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,696
(thunder crashing)

568
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,399
Well.

569
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,668
Slainte. - Slainte.

570
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:05,503
- Slainte.

571
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,610
- [Amy] Do you need any help with anything?

572
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,844
- Oh, no thanks.

573
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,479
Actually, I think, I've got everything

574
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,781
pretty much under control.

575
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,519
- [Amy] You have a really beautiful home.

576
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,053
- Thank you.

577
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:26,957
If you'd have told me a year ago we'd be living here,

578
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,426
I would've never believed it.

579
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,630
How about you, you live around here?

580
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,798
- Oh, no, I live in Wexford.

581
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,666
It's about a five-hour drive from here.

582
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:38,769
- How we doing?

583
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,240
- I think, everything's ready.

584
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,376
- Great, I'll start bringing things in.

585
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,677
- Alright, hon.

586
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,647
(thunder roaring)

587
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:53,050
(rain splashing harshly)

588
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,923
(dramatic music)

589
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,702
(thunder crashing)

590
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,677
Okay, here it comes.

591
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:23,280
- You know, I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.

592
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,883
- Well, I'm afraid you'll have to settle for turkey.

593
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,186
- Oh, that looks delicious.

594
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,721
- Doesn't that look good. - Honey, will you call

595
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:31,789
Aubrey down for dinner again?

596
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,923
- Yeah. - Thanks.

597
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,761
- Aubrey.

598
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,663
Come on, honey, it's dinner time.

599
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,831
- In a minute!

600
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,204
Colleen.

601
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,453
- Oh, I'm sorry, Father.

602
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:07,691
- Thank you, oh, Lord for the food before us, amen.

603
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,859
- Amen. - Amen.

604
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,000
(ominous music)

605
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,836
(spirit groaning)

606
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:36,086
- Let me get that for ya? - No, I got it, thanks.

607
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:36,921
- Okay.

608
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:44,495
(spirit grumbling)

609
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,832
(suspenseful music)

610
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,342
(Maura screaming)

611
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,577
(thunder crashing)

612
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:02,379
(suspenseful music)

613
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:03,681
(Maura screaming)

614
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,417
(glass breaking)

615
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,695
- Shea!

616
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:21,432
Shea!

617
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:23,334
Oh!

618
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,438
(suspenseful music)

619
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:31,442
(ghost voice whispering softly)

620
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,314
(soft gasping)

621
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,216
(glass shattering)

622
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:41,986
(loud screaming)

623
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:44,755
- Oh, my god!

624
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,957
We gotta get Aubrey.

625
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,559
- [Spirit] Get out!

626
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,665
(loud screaming)

627
00:43:59,036 --> 00:43:59,837
- Aubrey.

628
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,141
It's stuck, Will. - Honey, let me get it.

629
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,576
- [Maura] Aubrey!

630
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,778
- Step back, step back.

631
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,081
- Aubrey. - Aubrey.

632
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:11,915
- Aubrey.

633
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:13,951
- Aubrey. - Oh, my god!

634
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,119
Will, the window.

635
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,022
(thunder crashing)

636
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,392
- Aubrey! - Aubrey!

637
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:22,760
Aubrey! - Aubrey!

638
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,994
Aubrey!

639
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:24,828
Aubrey!

640
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,164
- Aubrey!

641
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,565
- Aubrey!

642
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,301
(loud screaming)

643
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:34,738
Will!

644
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,474
Will!

645
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:38,475
Will!

646
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:41,478
(suspenseful music)

647
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:46,116
- Come on.

648
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,389
(Maura gasping)

649
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,390
We gotta find her.

650
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,225
- You didn't find her.

651
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,427
- No.

652
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,694
Shea's dead.

653
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:58,529
- What?

654
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,565
- The cellar.

655
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:02,966
Te cellar, Will.

656
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,969
(suspenseful music)

657
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:09,940
(eerie music)

658
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:14,344
(overlapping ghostly voices moaning)

659
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,055
- No!

660
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:28,358
Aubrey!

661
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,360
Aubrey!

662
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,829
- Will, what is that?

663
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,964
- This isn't happening!

664
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,732
- The amulet where is it?

665
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:36,667
- What?

666
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,302
- Where have you put the amulet?

667
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,237
Where is it?

668
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,410
- What are you talking about what amulet?

669
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,846
- Did you remove anything from that cellar?

670
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,015
- How'd you know about that?

671
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,250
- Because I put it there.

672
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,888
(ghostly voice whispering)

673
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,957
Your daughter's been taken.

674
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,893
- What!

675
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,696
- I said nothing because

676
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,531
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

677
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:16,106
I've been here before to remove evil from this house.

678
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,676
The amulet is a guard against evil

679
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:21,245
blessed in countless rituals.

680
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,115
It's an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic Church.

681
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,550
- What does have to do with Aubrey?

682
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:27,484
Where is she?

683
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:28,886
- You must return the amulet

684
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,420
if you want your daughter back.

685
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,830
Your ancestors James and Mary Ann Laundrigan

686
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:44,368
were practitioners of black magic in this house.

687
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,737
- What does that have to do with us?

688
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:49,606
- The villages cut off both his hands as a punishment.

689
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,608
(man screaming loudly)

690
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:52,609
He died of gangrene.

691
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,312
Mary Ann took her own life

692
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,814
before they could burn her at the stake.

693
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:00,250
James vowed that there would be a curse

694
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,285
on this house forever.

695
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,555
- Where is my daughter?

696
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:06,957
- We laid Colleen to rest.

697
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:11,028
The evil has taken Aubrey in her place.

698
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,096
- Please, where is she?

699
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:15,933
- Your daughter is in grave danger.

700
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,701
Where is that amulet?

701
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:18,869
- I gave it to Shea.

702
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,208
- Is this what you're looking for, Father.

703
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,709
- That's it. - Yes.

704
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,946
(suspenseful music)

705
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,447
(ghostly voices groaning)

706
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:34,618
I'm going to need a hammer, some nails, and a candle.

707
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:37,888
Oh, and some pearls and onyx.

708
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,861
- I'll get the hammer.

709
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,438
- I have some pearls.

710
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:58,775
I don't have any onyx.

711
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:01,211
- Don't worry, I have.

712
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,282
- Here's your hammer and nails.

713
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,068
- Where does this amulet come from?

714
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,336
- It's origin is unknown.

715
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:31,008
But the symbol matches that of my dagger.

716
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,276
I found them both years ago

717
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:34,044
in the ruins of Clonmacoise's Abby.

718
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,414
But the dagger saves the soul of the possessed

719
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,916
if it's plunged directly into the heart,

720
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,184
so the ancients believed.

721
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,621
- [Amy] By killing them.

722
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:45,522
- By freeing them.

723
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,026
- I don't understand.

724
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:53,263
- The dagger destroys the evil,

725
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,998
and frees the soul it possessed.

726
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,738
- [Amy] What do these ingredients mean?

727
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,541
- The pearl is the twilight, the divinity.

728
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,576
The onyx is the signal of death.

729
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,946
As I said only fragments of these rituals exist.

730
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:12,115
And as far as I know, this is the procedure.

731
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,984
Now it suppresses the forces of evil.

732
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,520
It doesn't destroy them all together.

733
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:21,525
Now I'm going to need some blood from a woman.

734
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,528
(suspenseful music)

735
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,637
(ghostly voices groaning)

736
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,077
Rise, unless it remain.

737
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,884
This force is like a parasite or a virus.

738
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:51,388
It feeds on suspicion and doubt and fear.

739
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:54,157
Now you must clear your mind for it to reach out.

740
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,661
- How do we do that, Father.

741
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,862
- You must lead her out.

742
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,702
Talk to her, calm her fears.

743
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:07,137
Only she can cross over.

744
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:10,540
Well, go ahead.

745
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,343
I believe, right now she may hear you.

746
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:17,481
- Aubrey.

747
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,818
Aubrey, can you hear us?

748
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,653
It's mommy.

749
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,822
(thunder crashing)

750
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,825
- [Aubrey] Help me, please.

751
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,327
- My god, I heard something.

752
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,161
- Aubrey.

753
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,132
Honey, we're here.

754
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,333
Don't be afraid.

755
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,768
- [Aubrey] It's dark.

756
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:40,270
- Honey, we want you to come back to us.

757
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,005
- [Aubrey] I can't breathe.

758
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:43,273
- Aubrey, baby don't be scared.

759
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,809
Okay, it's just like a bad dream.

760
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,210
Listen to us.

761
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,378
- Keep talking.

762
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:53,283
- Aubrey, it can't hurt you if you're not afraid.

763
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,684
- [Aubrey] Daddy!

764
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,253
- Just think about mommy and daddy.

765
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:57,988
We're here for you.

766
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,356
- [Aubrey] I can't move.

767
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:02,826
(maniacal laughter) - Aubrey!

768
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:03,660
Aubrey.

769
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:08,031
Aubrey, Aubrey are you still there?

770
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,033
- Concentrate she can hear you.

771
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,337
- Aubrey, Aubrey baby come back to us, okay.

772
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,906
- [Aubrey] Mommy, help me.

773
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,407
- Don't be afraid.

774
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,042
- [Aubrey] They're hurting me.

775
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,311
- [Spirit] Tell her she's ours.

776
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:22,412
(loud bang)

777
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,447
- [Aubrey] Help!

778
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,450
(suspenseful music)

779
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:34,157
(suspenseful choral music swelling)

780
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,495
- Baby! - Mommy, I'm scared.

781
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:39,896
- [Maura] Baby!

782
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,031
- My god she's in there.

783
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:42,966
- [Aubrey] I'm scared, daddy.

784
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:43,800
- No!

785
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,002
No!

786
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,139
No, Will.

787
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:49,940
- Get out!

788
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:55,312
(hysterical crying)

789
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:58,882
(suspenseful music)

790
00:51:58,882 --> 00:51:59,950
- I'm scared!

791
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,419
Daddy, please!

792
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,556
Daddy, I'm scared!

793
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:08,091
- Close your eyes, Brey.

794
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:11,995
(suspenseful music)

795
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,906
(chains clanking)

796
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:28,144
It's okay.

797
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,513
- [Maura] Aubrey.

798
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:30,814
Aubrey.

799
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:31,648
Aubrey. - It's okay, honey.

800
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,482
She's all right.

801
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,316
She's all right.

802
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:37,721
Are you okay, baby, huh.

803
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,257
- Alright, huh.

804
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:42,926
(Maura sobbing)

805
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,466
Come on let's get her out of here, come on.

806
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,803
(thunder crashing)

807
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:56,039
- As long as the amulet remains in place,

808
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:58,475
the house will be protected.

809
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:01,778
- That's reassuring.

810
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:04,447
But the only time we'll be spending in that house,

811
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,483
is the time it takes us to pack our things.

812
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,487
- Look after the girl.

813
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:13,523
Look after your family they're important.

814
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,393
- Yeah, they are.

815
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,230
(door creaking)

816
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,071
How you doing?

817
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,273
- Okay. - Yeah.

818
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:31,441
How you doing?

819
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,150
You okay?

820
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,354
- A few years older perhaps.

821
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:52,229
- Here I'll get that for you.

822
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,668
Here you go.

823
00:53:58,668 --> 00:53:59,469
Easy.

824
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,473
- I suppose I should go.

825
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:04,808
- I'll take that too.

826
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:19,089
- Goodbye.

827
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,793
- I'm gonna walk her out.

828
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,036
- Are we leaving now, mommy?

829
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:35,005
- Yes, baby, we're leaving really soon.

830
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,961
- Take care.

831
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:13,610
(crickets chirping) I'm sure we'll all

832
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,512
sleep better in this hotel tonight.

833
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:16,646
Don't you think, honey?

834
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,255
Hey, you okay?

835
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:33,129
- Are we going back to California, daddy?

836
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:38,134
- Well.

837
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:43,306
What do you think we should do?

838
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,043
- Maybe you have a reason to stay here.

839
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,380
I mean, you seem to appreciate the local scenery.

840
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,849
- What do you mean by that?

841
00:55:58,988 --> 00:55:59,823
Hey, Maura.

842
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:02,258
Hey.

843
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:03,393
- Will.

844
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:04,561
- Hey, come here.

845
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,799
You don't look too good.

846
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,000
You feel alright?

847
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,569
- What's wrong with the way I look?

848
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,438
- I don't know maybe you're coming down with something.

849
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:16,673
- No, I'm fine.

850
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:20,677
- Okay.

851
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,086
You know I was thinking about what Father Seamus

852
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:34,357
was saying about distrust and discord.

853
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:38,194
You don't have anymore doubts about me, do you?

854
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:40,130
- Should I?

855
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:43,099
- No.

856
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,239
You two are the most important thing in my life.

857
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,148
I don't ever wanna lose you.

858
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:01,851
- I'm tired.

859
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,788
- I don't see why you should be.

860
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:23,072
Goodnight.

861
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:28,778
- See you in the morning.

862
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:34,551
- Yeah, see you in the mornin'.

863
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,689
(heavy sighing)

864
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:40,890
(crickets chirping)

865
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,392
- [Priest Voiceover] It is real,

866
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,828
and I've seen it in many forms and many disguises.

867
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:49,532
The human evil is self-evident in this world,

868
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,401
but there are other purer forms

869
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,536
belonging to the vapor and the darkness.

870
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:57,507
Save for the power of holy, unconditional love,

871
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,910
for that is the one force it can never defeat.

872
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,346
This I have to discovered.

873
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:11,120
(dramatic choral music)

874
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,875
(gentle music)

875
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:19,822
(dramatic choral music) - Wait a minute.

876
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:21,658
Do you hear something?

877
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:25,962
Do you care?

878
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:30,733
(soft moaning)

879
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,702
Oh, that feel so good.

880
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:35,471
(people moaning)

881
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,991
(suspenseful music)

882
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:59,362
(people moaning)

883
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,796
- Ooh, somebody likes to watch.

884
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,968
(maniacal laughter)

885
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:44,407
- No!

886
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:21,677
(birds chirping)

887
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,287
- I'm finished.

888
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:33,589
Where are we gonna go, mommy.

889
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:36,492
- Uh, we're going someplace new, honey.

890
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,303
- What about all my other stuff?

891
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:51,040
- We'll get it later.

892
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,009
- How long will it take?

893
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,181
Mommy.

894
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,986
(gentle choral music)

895
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:04,821
Mommy.

896
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:24,507
Mommy, how long is it gonna take?

897
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:25,608
- Go to your room now!

898
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:30,546
(dramatic music)

899
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:29,438
(suspenseful music)

900
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:49,192
(pulsating drums beating)

901
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,120
- We ready?

902
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,922
- You don't think I know!

903
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:23,726
- Know what!

904
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:24,994
- You think I'm an idiot?

905
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:28,965
- What?

906
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:31,834
(heavy breathing)

907
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,469
- Nothing has changed, has it?

908
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,639
I still can't trust you.

909
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:39,675
- Maura, what are you talking about?

910
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:42,979
Son of a...

911
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:44,680
Hey, Maura, what is this?

912
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,315
- We're not going. - What.

913
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,050
What are you out of your mind?

914
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,952
Tell me what's going on what did I do?

915
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:52,088
Maura.

916
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:58,728
- You leave and don't you ever come back.

917
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,096
- Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

918
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:01,697
Till you tell me what's going on.

919
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:03,432
- Now!

920
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:08,938
- Aubrey.

921
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,742
(suspense music)

922
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,378
Open the goddamn door!

923
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:16,646
- What's happening, mommy?

924
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,447
- Your father doesn't love us anymore.

925
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,292
- What do you mean your scaring me?

926
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,727
- Like I said he doesn't love you anymore.

927
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:32,662
- Ow!

928
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:33,562
- You're not going down there.

929
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:37,667
- You're hurting me.

930
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:43,906
(gentle music)

931
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:46,242
- And he'll never come back.

932
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,412
- Mommy, what's happening to you?

933
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:53,749
- Your father's evil.

934
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:55,651
I sent him away.

935
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:57,553
- What did he do?

936
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,088
I wanna see daddy.

937
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:00,356
Ow!

938
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,558
- You don't believe your mother, do you?

939
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:03,592
Do you? - Ow.

940
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:07,530
- I should've known you couldn't.

941
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,932
You love him more.

942
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:14,837
You love him more, and you believe all his lies.

943
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:15,771
- Mommy!

944
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,039
- I'll teach you to turn on me.

945
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,914
You can just stay here and think about it.

946
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,250
(lock engaging)

947
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,885

01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:32,888
(suspenseful music)

949
01:06:39,995 --> 01:06:43,332
(suspenseful chords flashing)

950
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,935
(soft sobbing)

951
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:52,241
- Somebody likes to watch,

952
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:54,610
likes to watch, likes to watch.

953
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,380
(loud screaming)

954
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,219
- He dares to disrespect me.

955
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:04,754
- [Will] I mean you don't have anymore doubts me, do ya?

956
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:08,224
You don't have anymore doubts me, do ya?

957
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:10,559
- He dares to disrespect me!

958
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:20,936
(voices whispering softly)

959
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,546
It's time to teach them a lesson.

960
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:42,258
(birds chirping)

961
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:56,672
- Father Seamus.

962
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:10,753
Father.

963
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,389
Father.

964
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:14,223
Father.

965
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:18,694
(heavy breathing)

966
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:21,397
(ominous music)

967
01:08:33,108 --> 01:08:34,343

(gentle choral music)

969
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:53,762
(heavy breathing)

970
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,826
- [Priest] Should the force return,

971
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,128
I fear more drastic measures may be necessary.

972
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,798
I don't know if they or I will have the strength.

973
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:40,175
The dagger destroys the evil

974
01:09:40,175 --> 01:09:41,977
and frees the soul of the possessed.

975
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,988
(suspenseful music)

976
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:57,927
- Mommy, mommy, mommy!

977
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:02,932
- Mother's just awful when she's like this.

978
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:10,506
(gentle choral music)

979
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:11,340
- Colleen.

980
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:16,645
(tense music)

981
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:56,452
- You're coming with me.

982
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:58,887
We'll suffer together.

983
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:04,159
Ah!

984
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:07,263
Aubrey!

985
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,469
(Aubrey screaming)

986
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:17,439
(suspenseful choral music)

987
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:20,376

988
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,789
(dramatic music)

989
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,264
(scissors whirling)

990
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:45,034
(Aubrey gasping)

991
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:02,217
- [Will] Aubrey.

992
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:08,590
(loud screaming)

993
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:15,264
(dramatic choral music)

994
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:26,575
- Mommy, no.

995
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:32,281
Please, mommy.

996
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:38,721
(dramatic choral music)

997
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,159
- Maura.

998
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,396
Get away from her!

999
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:58,107
Aubrey, run!

1000
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:28,604
I'm sorry.

1001
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:30,539
- Mommy!

1002
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,513
(Maura hissing)

1003
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:40,649
(scissors whirling)

1004
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:41,483
Daddy.

1005
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:43,819
(will groaning)

1006
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:47,423
(suspenseful choral music)

1007
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:56,098
(Maura screaming)

1008
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:03,505
Mommy, daddy!

1009
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:11,747
- Brey, get back!

1010
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:12,915
- Mommy, stop!

1011
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:23,158
(Maura screaming)

1012
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,169
- Come back to us, Maura.

1013
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,206
- No.

1014
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:38,707
We'll destroy you!

1015
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:43,011
- No, you won't!

1016
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:44,780
- No!

1017
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:49,551
(loud screaming) No!

1018
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,891
(piercing demonic screaming)

1019
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:05,567
(gentle music)

1020
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:14,142
(overlapping voices groaning)

1021
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,133
- Mommy. - Baby.

1022
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:43,038
What's happening?

1023
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:46,341
(suspenseful music) Baby, what happened?

1024
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:47,776
What's happening?

1025
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:00,122
- [Will] Whoa, we gotta get out of here.

1026
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:01,323

- We here. - Hey, hey.

1031
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:14,896
We're safe, you're safe.

1032
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:16,431
- We're here. - I'm okay.

1033
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:18,467
I'm okay. - Yeah, baby.

1034

(glass shattering)

1035

1036
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:32,514
- You're bleeding.

1037
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:36,485
- I'm fine, so glad you came back to me.

1038
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:43,725
(dramatic music)

1039
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:46,461
(fire crackling)

1040
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,365
(heavy breathing)

1041
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:53,735
Did I tell you I love you guys so much?

1042
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:57,139
(dramatic choral music)

1043
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:41,249
Come on.

1044
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:44,586
Let's get out of here.
