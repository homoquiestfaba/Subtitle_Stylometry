1
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,870
PIRATES

2
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,600
Oh God, Isabel

3
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,530
I can not begin to tell you how good I feel right now

4
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,780
"I love the perfection, I must admit, I'm nervous

5
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,470
Nervous?, We should not be nervous

6
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,850
Is it true that the Caribbean Sea is full of pirates?

7
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:44,090
Yes, but would not let a pirate in sight or sound yours

8
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,200
You are very sexy

9
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
I can not wait to see your body

10
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,690
Already, we're married

11
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,660
You'll see it soon

12
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,360
But there is something

13
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,840
What if he told you, you decide that you do not like?

14
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,280
Then I must sell you a pirate as a sex slave

15
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,520
I think it's worth a few gold coins

16
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,550
You're a fool

17
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,650
- What? "Seriously

18
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,110
You're my wife now and forever, nothing will change that

19
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,930
I love you for all you are

20
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,370
Everything you're not and all that will be

21
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
Thanks love

22
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,840
Thank God. Divine Perfection

23
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:51,070
I've waited for 260 years this magnificent moment

24
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,140
We are close and she has no sign that we have seen

25
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,170
Good job, keep surfing as a soft ball

26
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,160
If Captain

27
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,480
What happens?

28
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,110
Nothing ... my love back to sleep

29
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,290
Where you going honey?

30
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,220
I'll breathe the sea air, and back

31
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,800
"Manuel, you ever seen a night so divine?

32
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,610
In all my years at sea he had never seen such serenity

33
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,980
God has blessed us with peace tonight

34
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,910
Definitely yes

35
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,850
How long before we get to Caribbean waters?

36
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,120
"We'll not later than the morning - So fast?

37
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,060
If we lose the calm breeze, and if it increases, get ...

38
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,190
... Before the sun rises. Still, I'll take safe

39
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,100
No doubt it has always sailed fast and careful

40
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,070
Thanks friend

41
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,100
Go, you should be resting with your beautiful wife

42
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,270
Perhaps it is cold without you

43
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,140
He's right captain. Good night

44
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,520
- How is the sea air? "The only air I want ...

45
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,720
... Is breathing your breath

46
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,700
I love you so

47
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,660
When I have my treasure, I'll give you everything you want

48
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,870
I have no desire

49
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,710
I was a little more endulzarte

50
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,680
You're a fool

51
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,040
I'm a fool for you

52
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,630
It brings together sailors on the bow, and bring me down passengers

53
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:43,510
And Sarina ... Although I love you so, do not consider

54
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,240
kill anyone this time

55
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,820
What are you doing?

56
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,080
If you let it go I'll do what you want

57
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,660
There is no need for something so violent

58
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,820
Silence

59
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,000
Hello, my name is Captain Victor Stagnetti

60
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,740
I apologize for any inconvenience that we ...

61
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,840
Pirates ... they've caused, we are pirates

62
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,510
Sadly this is our way of being

63
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,980
Usually this would end with people like you beheaded

64
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,350
For the head you eat sharks, but this

65
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,300
... Has to happen if I get what I want

66
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,640
What do you want?

67
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,090
Captain, was at that point

68
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,890
I hate when you interrupt me, right?

69
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,630
Now

70
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,630
I've been looking for a man for a long, long time

71
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,800
My search ends here and now

72
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,540
The man with the name of Manuel Valenzuela, forward pass

73
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,570
How nice pearl necklace

74
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,920
She

75
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,410
I'm Manuel Valenzuela

76
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,230
Manuel I

77
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,760
"Please, let me save, I would have to ...

78
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,500
... Throw the whole boat to meet you

79
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,700
"Captain, please, let me save-No. You are very valuable ...

80
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,770
... For shark meat. That is the fate of your beautiful lady

81
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,640
"You'll be by my side so you're safe," Please, it ...

82
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,280
... My wife is not left to die. I beg you, please ...

83
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,550
... Compassion. "Thank you gentlemen for your time

84
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,980
You can follow his path. Gentlemen, returned to

85
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:40,270
"La Rosa Del Diablo." And my vicious lady, also

86
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,000
Hellsmith, get ready to sail

87
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,630
- Do let go to save? "Of course not, húndelos!

88
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,320
Captain's Log, August 26, 1763

89
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,980
It has been four long weeks without seeing land

90
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,690
The sailors are impatient and discouraged

91
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,970
I try to motivate and teach them how to fight ...

92
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,900
.. With swords, but soon tire

93
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,980
Somehow, the First Lady, Jules keeps them ...

94
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,010
... The moral high ground. As it does not, I have no idea

95
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,520
Many men do not articulate a lot and she's ...

96
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,320
... Help you improve your oral or fighting attributes. More ...

97
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,330
... Night I hear noises from the cockpit, which can only be ...

98
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,420
... Be produced by his devotion

99
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,380
At least we know that the good Lord be with us ...

100
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,150
... On our trip, but there are many more problems later

101
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,450
Food supplements are quite low and I fear ...

102
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,420
... We have to return to port again. I have wanted ...

103
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,430
... From pirates to face but the truth, I'm worried ...

104
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,230
Chang Woo because you can not make new guns ...

105
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,430
... Shoot very well. Each time the cannon fired smells ...

106
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:41,270
... A goat's tail. Woo believes that the powder you need more potassium ...

107
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,930
... And less sulfur

108
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,300
The bad news is that we do not have potassium

109
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,130
The same fight with the pirates with swords or hand ...

110
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,140
... To the death if necessary. I feel at ease ...

111
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,640
... Knowing that soon manage to find something. At the call ...

112
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,880
... Action, my crew you want thrown out. We are men ...

113
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:11,920
... And women in cold blood, we fear hackers. I fear to me ...

114
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,880
Edwards Captain Reynolds. Captain of the "sea horse"

115
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,350
"Edward," Excuse me, is the captain

116
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,450
And he has said clearly not want to be interrupted. Just ...

117
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,650
... When we are under attack, and careful, "Okay, I speak ...

118
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:36,660
... With the commander-is necessary to complete the log.

119
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:43,230
"Okay, they apologized. Later continue

120
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,100
I suggest you to report immediately to the bow

121
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,140
Yes

122
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,870
Captain

123
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,290
Oxford was right, you should not bother me. As a captain ...

124
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,520
... Of "sea horse" is my work with all protocols are ...

125
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,660
... Followed exactly. And as captain of the ship I have to ...

126
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:17,070
... Make sure my orders are followed exactly

127
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,500
As captain it is my responsibility to the rules ...

128
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,680
... Are respected. Edward, for the charade.

129
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,010
What happens?

130
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,890
I'm a bad captain, I can not hunt pirates, or even ...

131
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,890
... I can hunt one. The crew hates me - What do you mean?

132
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,930
You dreaming of this since we were children

133
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,970
I'm a bad commander, we have not seen a boat

134
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,590
pirate in four weeks, four weeks!

135
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,640
Your father was right, I should have stayed on the plantation ...

136
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,550
... Snuff, helping to harvest it

137
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:04,350
-No. S lost faith in you ...

138
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,050
If true, had never previously been in a boat ...

139
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,920
... Like this. Is it true you've never been in combat ...

140
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,030
... With a man or a pirate. I really do not know is the sea ...

141
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:22,200
... But you have a dream and that is stronger than any ...

142
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,920
... Wisdom or experience. It is your destiny

143
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,720
What if this is not my destiny? What if this is not my dream?

144
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,960
You can "what" your whole life and die peacefully in a ...

145
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,960
... Warm bed or you can make your life worth and prevent ...

146
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,490
... That the pirates make others suffer as they do

147
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,710
Let's see what our fate has in store for us

148
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,090
- Where are they? "For the bow.

149
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,950
I see nothing.

150
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,090
There's something floating in the water.

151
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,120
I see nothing, check the lights of the dead, Oxford.

152
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,200
There is someone floating in the wood.

153
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,470
Man in the water.

154
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:29,000
Hampton, takes the boat has the remains. "Yes master, we are already.

155
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,500
Help me carry it inside.

156
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,500
Okay, you're safe.

157
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,800
- Are you okay? "Yes, just a little disoriented.

158
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,740
Take care. Drink this, will help you relax.

159
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,880
My name is Captain Edward Reynolds and you're safe ...

160
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,680
... In my boat, "El Caballo Marino" - Are pirates?

161
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,050
"Pirates, no. Well, I, what ... "We're hunting pirates.

162
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:15,420
Thank God, I thought I would die.

163
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,190
"You're safe here. "That's what Manuel said.

164
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,290
- Who is Manuel? "My husband.

165
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,530
- Was your ship attacked by pirates? -Si. We just ...

166
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,670
... Married in Spain. We went to the island of Seville.

167
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:33,270
"He was my family. "Sorry.

168
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,870
"Sorry. "We were attacked by pirates.

169
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,680
Then the pirate captain told my husband that

170
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,980
take out the face and reveal, but Manuel did not.

171
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,050
"And I dived into the water. - Do you remember his name?

172
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,890
"I think I said his name was Victus. "Stagnetti.

173
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,990
- Who is it? "It is a personification of ...

174
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:58,630
... All that is wrong. "We must find him.

175
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,000
"You may be in the middle of the ocean now. "Like, we ...

176
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,500
... Find it. But first, we need to supplement e. ..

177

I must say, I'm a little nervous with you here.

427
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,050
Cristina and Madelin told me that you're a Pirates game.

428
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:44,920
I always wanted to meet a real pirate hunting.

Not only are beautiful, your words are poems.

434

"The black room, where is that? -2 Blocks to the left

I'll go with you. Together we will fight against Victor.

444
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:02,830
No, this is something I must do alone.

445

No, please. I can not stand the smell of here now. Not even ...

446

Your pain tolerance is incredible.

458

Why do not you tell me where she lives the Indian? Not hurt.

- Why not a magician? "I like that.

478
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:33,040
The captain will be pleased with that.

479
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,520
My mother taught me how to make black powder.

480
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,590
Someday I'll be a magician, and perhaps I will see my father again.

481
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,060
How about you?

482
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,130
