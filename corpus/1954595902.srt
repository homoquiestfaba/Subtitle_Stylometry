1
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:34,335
Ten minutes to curtain. Ten minutes.

2
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:38,506
All the world...
all the world is a stage.

3
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,209
And all the men and women...

4
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,923
merely players.

5
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,982
They have exits.

6
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:50,985
And they have their entrances.

7
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:53,454
And they have their exits.

8
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,388
And they have their entrances.

9
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:02,561
And one man in his time
plays many parts.

10
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:10,802
His acts being seven ages.

11
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,574
Do you believe that?

12
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:22,516
Was that real for you?

13
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,094
No, be honest.

14
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,253
Was it honest?

15
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,497
Yes, it was, wasn't it?

16
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,633
No, it wasn't.

17
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,970
It wasn't honest?

18
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,841
Well, what was it then?

19
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:50,444
No, not very good, no.

20
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,546
I don't believe it.

21
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,348
Should I try it again?

22
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,651
The world is a stage

23
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,654
and all men and women merely players.

24
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,357
How about that? Any better?

25
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,228
They have their exits
and their entrances.

26
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:11,399
Were you affecting it
or were you really saying it?

27
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:15,703
And one, a man in his life

28
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,706
plays many parts.

29
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:24,312
Did that mean anything to you or anyone
that ever existed in the world?

30
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:27,582
Are you fooling yourself?

31
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:32,687
Were you not committing
to your own instincts?

32
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,990
What are you supposed to do?
Jump up and down?

33
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,526
You know, do a jig?

34
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:42,064
Just say your words.
Shakespeare will do the rest.

35
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:44,298
- You know that.
- Five minutes.

36
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,969
Five minutes. Five minutes.

37
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,604
My face of masks.

38
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,107
My tragedy and my comedy.

39
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,943
Let's put these together tonight, buddy.

40
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,712
I love you both.

41
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,214
Seven ages.

42
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,316
There are seven ages.

43
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,015
First...

44
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,789
his acts being seven ages.

45
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,693
Then the... the whining school boy.

46
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,126
And the whining...

47
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,637
Sighing like an, oh, sighing...

48
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:20,577
like a furnace.

49
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,870
What is a man? No, that's Hamlet.

50
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,710
Hello?

51
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,461
Oh, no.

52
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,370
- Open! Oh!
- Yeah?

53
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,527
Thank God.
I just was... I was just in here.

54
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:49,663
- I was... I got locked out.
- I didn't see you come out.

55
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,999
- I'm Simon Axler.
- No, you're not.

56
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,267
I'm Simon Axler.

57
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,503
- I have the dressing room upstairs.
- Do you need a dollar or something?

58
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,369
I'm in the play!

59
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,418
- I got to be on stage.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

60
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:12,453
- You got to let me through.
- No, no, no.

61
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,856
I'm in there.
I'm supposed to be on stage.

62
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:16,824
The play has already started.
You're going to have to...

63
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,126
- I'm in the play!
- Keep your voice down.

64
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:22,530
I'm Simon Axler. I'm on the marquee.

65
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,200
I'm in the lobby. The picture...
like this. Dressed like this.

66
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,036
I'm in the show.
Why would I be dressed like this?

67
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,239
- Please.
- No, no, no. Outside.

68
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,243
I'm Simon Axler. I'm Simon Axler.
I'm in the play.

69
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,745
All men... all men...

70
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,947
And all women... are players.

71
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,550
All men... they're... they are players.

72
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,716
They... they... they have...

73
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:48,022
I'm Simon Axler. I'm on the marquee.

74
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,790
I play the lead.

75
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,227
I'm Simon Axler. I'm Simon Axler.

76
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,428
Three minutes.

77
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,501
Did I miss my cue?

78
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,904
I missed my cue.

79
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:06,207
There is not one so young
and so villainous this day living.

80
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,876
I am heartily glad I came hither to you.

81
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,945
I'll give him his payment.
God take your worship.

82
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:15,850
- 30 seconds.
- I hope I shall see an end of him.

83
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,786
For my soul, yet I know not why,

84
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:21,055
hates nothing more...

85
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:24,423
The last scene of all...

86
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:31,465
that ends this...

87
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:36,735
strange eventful history...

88
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,031
is...

89
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:43,401
second childishness...

90
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,406
and mere...

91
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:51,140
oblivion...

92
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,053
sans teeth...

93
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,114
sans eyes...

94
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,580
sans...

95
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,316
taste...

96
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,935
sans everything.

97
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:34,895
The famous pianist, sometimes actor,
and brilliant raconteur

98
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,665
Oscar Levant once said,

99
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:42,203
"There is a thin line
between genius and insanity."

100
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:44,347
And he had erased that line.

101
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,312
In a few minutes,
we'll get you something for the pain.

102
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,181
Did you believe that,
that moan I just did,

103
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,451
about my pain? Did you believe that?

104
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,753
I did.

105
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:02,189
I didn't. Can I try that again?

106
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,410
I think it can be a little more subtle.
Ready?

107
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:14,201
No, that's too much.
I can bring it down a little bit.

108
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,903
As an actor...

109
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,240
I've come the realization that...

110
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,366
I'm having trouble separating
a scene from a play

111
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,580
with the realities in real life.

112
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,616
I was out one day. I was out, I think.

113
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:33,020
Did you believe that, what I just did?
What I just said?

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,622
I thought I did that one.

115
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:38,490
Let me say it as clearly as possible.

116
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,695
I will never go on stage again.

117
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,026
I love this house.

118
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,132
14 years, it...

119
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:53,109
still...

120
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,934
looks like you haven't moved in.

121
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,881
Oh, you...

122
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,384
you'll get some rest.

123
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,519
Please don't say that.

124
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,422
I don't sleep. You know that.

125
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:18,359
I don't sleep.

126
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:21,695
So you don't have to say,
"Get some sleep."

127
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:23,775
Well...

128
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:26,432
you know...

129
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,402
you'll call me...

130
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,169
if you... if you get any bad ideas.

131
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,921
Well, when I got home
after the accident,

132
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,457
at the theater, I never...

133
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,593
I couldn't remember what happened.

134
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,996
Then I realized that
16 days had gone by.

135
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,661
I don't recollect anything
that happened in those days.

136
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,050
And did that scare you?

137
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,874
No, it didn't.

138
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:12,112
At the time, but now,
I don't know when I think about it.

139
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:16,014
It's concerning.

140
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,629
You know, I didn't have friends, really.

141
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,432
I didn't have people I could...

142
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,932
I could talk to.

143
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,805
No family, of course.

144
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,441
Maybe... I don't know how that happened.

145
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,676
No children.

146
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,022
No wife.

147
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,323
I always wondered why I had a shotgun.

148
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,759
And it that moment, I realized it.

149
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,664
It was because of Hemingway.

150
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,465
Hemingway blew his
brain's out with a shotgun.

151
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,591
That had to be the only reason I had it.

152
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:10,168
Because I'm not a gun person.

153
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,709
Hemingway must have had longer arms.

154
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,623
Jerry. Sorry to call you this late.
It's Simon.

155
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,490
I think I'm in some kind of trouble.

156
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:34,961
Yeah.

157
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,861
And that's how we met.

158
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,875
We're going to keep you pretty
busy here over the next 30 days.

159
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:49,983
I like busy.

160
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,959
Do I have a room?

161
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:55,048
- Yes, you've got a nice room.
- Is it a single room? Am I alone?

162
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:59,486
- It will be a double room for the first week.
- A double room? Oh, I don't know about that.

163
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:02,022
But look, I'm famous, you know?

164
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,525
And I'm sorry, I know,
maybe you don't know who I am,

165
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,058
but I'm famous. And I...

166
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,811
You got to not do that, doc,
because that just is upsetting to me.

167
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,313
- Not do what?
- Write when I talk.

168
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,919
It's like, you're doing a play,

169
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,417
and all of a sudden the audience
is writing in the program.

170
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,366
That's why I hate opening nights
because the fucking critics go in there,

171
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:36,023
and they're writing,
they're writing in their pads,

172
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:39,893
- and writing everywhere and you see them.
- You don't like it when people write things?

173
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,960
Yeah, well, it bothers me.

174
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,904
Hello, Oliver.

175
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,740
- How are you doing?
- What are you doing?

176
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,642
- Oh, these will help you sleep.
- No, no, that doesn't work.

177
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,576
No, trust me. These are different.

178
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:06,586
Acting is what I do.
It always came easy to me.

179
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,889
I never had a problem with it.

180
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,291
You know, it was just like...

181
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,127
They say, "To the men are born."

182
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:18,298
I was born with it. I love the stage.
I love being on the stage.

183
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:23,561
I was always, like, myself.
You know, and I was very...

184
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,340
natural, you know.
It was like home, being on the stage.

185
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,744
The fall was a gradual one.

186
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:35,349
I think it really started
when I lost track of...

187
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:39,950
what I... what I would
call my... my craft.

188
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,925
There are a lot of things, you know,
you can deal with, but your craft,

189
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:51,298
I mean, it's sort of like a musician

190
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:54,401
losing his ability to...

191
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,070
to play the keys.

192
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,507
I know it's happened to great
musicians before, but...

193
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,743
how about losing your ear?

194
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:06,079
And I don't mean like Beethoven,
I mean, like...

195
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,082
that's what I felt about losing...

196
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,950
my... my gift...

197
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,953
my talent.

198
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,156
It just started to recede.

199
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:25,298
Mainly the desire, I think.

200
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:29,300
The appetite to do it started to...

201
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,975
fade, or... I don't know.

202
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,744
I lost track of it.

203
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,714
Anyway, you know, you...

204
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:44,264
you're not prepared for that
kind of thing. It sort of...

205
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:46,290
the writing's on the wall
for other things,

206
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,489
like you're going to lose your friends.

207
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,892
You know, what do they
say about athletes?

208
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,461
First their legs go,

209
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:58,932
their knees, then their money goes,
then their friends go.

210
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,735
So, you know that stuff, but...

211
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,471
the inability to...

212
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,335
remember words...

213
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,841
How did that happen?

214
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,083
I mean, I actually would be in a play,

215
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,785
just the other day...

216
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,832
and I...

217
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:27,260
I would be saying lines
from a play I did ten years ago,

218
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,329
which was a totally different play.

219
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,735
And of course,

220
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:37,601
that's really unsettling.

221
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:42,476
The audiences start to... to...

222
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:46,548
I'm not alone here.
You're listening to what I'm saying.

223
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,717
Does this interest you in any way?

224
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:54,521
So I can go on? I feel like I'm...

225
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,168
hogging everything here.

226
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:02,195
I don't know what else I can say
except that it got really bad,

227
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,464
worse and worse.

228
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,398
When... when the audiences started...

229
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,878
When the audiences started to, you know,

230
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:21,012
recede and not want to...

231
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,484
participate with me... anymore.

232
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,224
Sensing what was happening...

233
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,394
it was just too much to take. I...

234
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,221
I just didn't...

235
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:43,236
I lost something that I had all my life.

236
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,772
It was gone.

237
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,688
Like, just gone, like magic.

238
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,792
And I...

239
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:58,419
I couldn't have even conceived of
something like that happening, so...

240
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,015
what to do? What to do?

241
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,425
Would you mind cleaning the tables?

242
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,961
Yes. Okay.

243
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,030
First, leave me my drink.
What is wrong with you?

244
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,033
This is no good, you see.

245
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,069
Excuse me sir,
we're doing a survey on reactions.

246
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,318
- Would you like to take part?
- Yeah, sure.

247
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:21,107
Thank you. That's two points.

248
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,543
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

249
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,612
- No, never.
- Thank you very much.

250
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:27,545
Do you like it?

251
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,751
That's another two points.

252
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:36,323
Simon, would you be free
later today for a chat?

253
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,392
Oh, I have other plans.

254
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,631
You know, I might be able
to fit you in next Thursday.

255
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:46,564
Thursday.

256
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,503
I was just joking.

257
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:54,808
I was only joking. Of course I'll
be able to have a chat with you.

258
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,110
That was so convincing.

259
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,015
I was the perfect wife
for the perfect 20th century,

260
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:07,554
East Coast, Ivy-league educated,
well-respected, wealthy husband.

261
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:10,223
Our house was just outside the city.

262
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:13,994
And it was the perfect place for us
to celebrate our perfect lives.

263
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,230
And we have two...

264
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,747
perfect children.

265
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:23,169
We have a five-year-old boy
and a seven-year-old girl

266
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,773
to fit into our perfect lives.
Then one afternoon,

267
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:31,177
I went into the city to do some shopping
and halfway there I realized

268
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,314
that I had left my wallet
back at the house,

269
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,249
and so I drove back home.

270
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:40,086
I could only see the top
of my little girl's head

271
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:44,491
from the back of the sofa
and the TV was on

272
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,893
and the Saturday cartoons were playing,

273
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,696
but that's what she would have been
watching under any circumstances.

274
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,967
- I'm sorry, are you following me?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

275
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:58,853
So everything was in order
except I had to wonder why

276
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:02,909
the little cotton underpants
were lying on the arm of the couch.

277
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,301
Now you probably see
where I'm going with this, but...

278
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:09,749
when I got to the back of the couch
and I looked over,

279
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:15,228
I was... I was not prepared to see my
rich and powerful husband's head

280
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:18,692
out of sight and under
my little girl's skirt.

281
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:22,195
You know, it's a terrible
thing to say, I know,

282
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,821
but while she's talking,
all I'm thinking about is

283
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:27,801
maybe this is some kind
of test, you know,

284
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:33,525
like they're testing me
to see if I buy this stuff.

285
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,060
Is this going to make me better?

286
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,313
I mean, is this part of the therapy?

287
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:44,384
You know...
the sick talking to the sicker.

288
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:47,387
And I made some kind of noise,

289
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,620
and my husband's head appeared from...

290
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,461
from... from where it had been,

291
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:58,498
and... and he looked at me, and he says,

292
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,001
"Oh, hi.

293
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,270
Aren't you off to the city?"

294
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,905
And I stood there frozen,

295
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:13,110
my heart turning over,
and my throat burning...

296
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,071
and I had nothing to say.

297
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,988
Nothing.

298
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,798
There she is pouring her heart out

299
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:30,263
and all I can do is think about
how she's doing it.

300
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:33,466
I mean, how she's performing it.

301
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,535
I don't know, I would have...
I would have...

302
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,138
been a little bit more
emotional at this point,

303
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,173
I had to remove myself.
You know what I'm saying?

304
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:41,770
And I'm...

305
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,643
watching her like I'm watching
a Tennessee Williams play.

306
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:53,539
I need someone to kill my husband.

307
00:20:55,288 --> 00:21:00,047
Did you ask if she was ever
under psychiatric care before?

308
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,932
- No.
- Weren't you curious?

309
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,635
Well, to be honest,
it never entered my mind.

310
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,238
I'm sure you can find... you'll be
able to find somebody that can do that.

311
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,413
Well, you.

312
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,213
If I was a killer,
I would tell you this.

313
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:22,642
I'd do it pro bono.

314
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:24,818
I'd do it, but, you know,

315
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:27,620
I'm an out-of-work actor.

316
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,891
I'd botch the job, I'm sure.

317
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:33,658
So, you know...

318
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,366
Are you serious? Are you serious?

319
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:44,152
Yeah. I mean,
of course I'm willing to pay.

320
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,974
Oh, no. Sybil, Sybil, listen.

321
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,600
When you do a play,

322
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,181
do you ever ask about
the character's background, past?

323
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:58,551
- Of course, yeah.
- But not in real life?

324
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:04,023
I saw you in that film about the man
who slaughters all his neighbors.

325
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,126
Yeah, murders the neighbor next door.

326
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:08,394
Yeah. You were so convincing.

327
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,697
That was a fiction, Sybil. Fiction.

328
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,267
You can't just go around asking people

329
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:18,405
if they'd kill your husband for you.
It's not done.

330
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,573
It's socially...

331
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,243
socially awkward.

332
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,811
- You know?
- But you're not.

333
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:27,647
You're not people, Simon.

334
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,514
- What?
- You're my friend.

335
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,453
Yum, yum, yummy.

336
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:42,829
I lost my talent for no good reason
and now just as arbitrarily,

337
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:47,133
I'm losing the desire to kill myself.
Or it's... I mean, I lost it.

338
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,971
The most important thing is you're
leaving here a stronger man.

339
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:55,141
And remember, we'll continue
our private sessions on Skype.

340
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,277
Oh, yeah, Skype.
I got that in my head, you know.

341
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,013
- Yeah. Good.
- All the instructions in my head.

342
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:02,549
Well, you know, my big worry is that

343
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:07,021
every time I see a camera,
I sort of, you know,

344
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:09,790
I feel the need to perform.

345
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,592
- It's a habit.
- Don't expect any applause. It's just us.

346
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,962
- Hi.
- Hi. May I help you?

347
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,082
You don't remember me?

348
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:46,113
Oh, man, you're kidding.

349
00:23:46,213 --> 00:23:47,927
Little Pegeen.

350
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,964
How are you? Come on in. Wow.

351
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:53,366
It's a delivery from my parents.

352
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:56,617
Oh, gee, thanks. Wow.

353
00:23:57,817 --> 00:24:03,533
God. I still have this image of you
sucking at your mother's breast.

354
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,114
Pure class.

355
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,313
Well...

356
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,920
You know, when I was, like,
8 and you were, like, 40,

357
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,255
I had a massive crush on you?

358
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:18,844
- You did? Whoa.
- Big time.

359
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:20,444
Well...

360
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:22,944
- Look at you now.
- Yeah.

361
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,347
Do I have something on my face
or do you always space out

362
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,849
in the direction of people
you haven't seen in a while?

363
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:47,288
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I was staring, wasn't I?

364
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:50,089
I was a little lost. I'm sorry.

365
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:55,462
Simon Axler, whose presence in a room
is as dazzling as his presence on stage.

366
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,900
Simon Axler,
with the charisma that kills.

367
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,590
What happened? Did you get shot?

368
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,108
What brings you here?

369
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:11,444
I live near you now.
I teach at Westcott.

370
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:15,148
You teach? At Westcott Women's College?

371
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:16,683
- Yeah.
- There.

372
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:19,124
Theater, acting, scenic design.

373
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:23,690
- Family trade.
- Precisely.

374
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,705
You know, your mother and I co-starred
when she played Pegeen Mike

375
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:31,165
- at the Bramford Theater.
- Yes, I know.

376
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:35,799
I've heard all of the stories.
Old theater friends. Long before my time.

377
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,070
So...

378
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,712
Do you remember
the last time you saw me?

379
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:48,047
Yes.

380
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:52,425
- You must have been 10, 11 years old.
- You remember what you gave me?

381
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,188
I gave you the wedding ring
I wore in Streetcar.

382
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,397
I slept with that wedding ring
under my pillow for...

383
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:06,058
What?

384
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,770
I thought that it meant
that you would marry me.

385
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,707
But then a couple of decades
went by and you never showed up.

386
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:18,242
Well, you all moved 3,000
miles away, you know.

387
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,683
So, tell me, how are you parents doing?

388
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:26,553
I don't know.
I mostly try to avoid them.

389
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:28,521
Why?

390
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:32,555
They don't approve
of who I'm living with.

391
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:35,541
Oh, yeah?

392
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,764
Who is he? What is he?

393
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:40,030
It's a she.

394
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,701
She? Whoa.

395
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:47,251
Well, that's okay.

396
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:49,342
Great.

397
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,440
Shit.

398
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:55,313
I got to take this shit. Sorry.

399
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,084
Okay.

400
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,841
Hello?

401
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:05,473
Oh, hi, yeah. No, I just...
I stopped by his house and we talked.

402
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:08,428
Yes, we're talking. We're talking.

403
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:13,466
No, I just got back. It's a nice house.
It's a really nice house. Yeah.

404
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:19,171
Because basically it's none of
your goddamn business, okay?

405
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:20,907
Okay, I'll talk to you
when I talk to you.

406
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:23,774
I'll talk to you when I
talk to you. Okay, bye.

407
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,144
Oh, God.

408
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,516
Everything all right?

409
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:34,820
Yeah, it's just someone's freaking out
about casting for Tuesday.

410
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:39,125
- This is Sunday.
- I know. They were just being annoying.

411
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:41,494
- Yeah.
- Oh, you know, maybe you could help.

412
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:44,130
We're doing a contemporary
adaptation of Macbeth

413
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,832
- and I cannot think of another actor...
- No.

414
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:47,954
I'd like to try it out on more than you.

415
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,537
- Not a good idea.
- Why not?

416
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:52,964
I get anxious.

417
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,944
And here I was thinking you were
getting back your killer charisma.

418
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,080
- Oh, no.
- This is all very unlike you.

419
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,248
- It is?
- Yeah.

420
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,708
You know what's like me?

421
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:09,019
Yeah, I'm starting to figure it out.

422
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:11,491
Well...

423
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:14,691
We should get this to
run all over the house.

424
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,565
Want to stay for dinner?

425
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,599
- Yeah, okay.
- Good.

426
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,242
Oh, no.

427
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:52,062
- It's okay.
- Oh, the waiter in me.

428
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,118
- Have some.
- Wow.

429
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,020
We're brilliant engineers

430
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:18,556
and we didn't even have
to employ... abused labor.

431
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,032
So, what happened with your acting?

432
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:32,076
I don't know.
Just it's just too tedious to discuss.

433
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:36,008
Well, did something happen
or did you retire?

434
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,344
Would you...
please don't ask me about that.

435
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,764
You know, I've been really...

436
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:46,619
spending, like, 30 days
talking about nothing else, so...

437
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:48,721
- Okay, well...
- ...if we could just, you know.

438
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:50,798
What do you want to talk about?

439
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,926
Well, there's the...

440
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,959
the signing of...

441
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,907
- I thought you slept with women.
- I do.

442
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,562
What do you think of her?

443
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:16,348
Well, she's my friend's daughter.

444
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:19,349
And she's a lesbian.

445
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,640
You never been with a man?

446
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:25,524
Not in 16 years.

447
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:28,160
Oh, well...

448
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,598
I haven't been with
a lesbian in 67 years.

449
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,946
That you know of.

450
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:41,204
Flirtatious lesbian, I might add.
However that's possible.

451
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:43,962
You...

452
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,947
I don't know what to say.

453
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,241
You're a... you're with a woman now?

454
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:54,318
Yeah. Kind... Yeah, pretty much.

455
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:00,393
Why do you... why do you say that?

456
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,363
Well, she's a lesbian
and she's flirting with me.

457
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,301
Doesn't bother you, the age difference?

458
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,437
I have been thinking
about you inappropriately

459
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,823
since it was really inappropriate.

460
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:17,176
Well, you're the psychiatrist.

461
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:20,310
How does that track with you?

462
00:31:55,714 --> 00:32:00,550
But who is this who lies so very awake?

463
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:06,590
It was thus when I awoke.

464
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,995
So, what shall we do with it, my lord?

465
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:17,570
For now I would say...

466
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,072
let it be.

467
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:23,040
Enjoy what time it has left.

468
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,725
Or perhaps...

469
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:30,516
we could...

470
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,319
just talk gentle to it

471
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,987
or...

472
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,972
maybe just keep it

473
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,892
warm and safe.

474
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:25,404
Yeah?

475
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:29,341
Be forewarned, Mr. Famous.

476
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,577
Pegeen is desirable,

477
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:35,247
she's audacious,
and she's utterly ruthless.

478
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:40,017
Utterly cold-hearted, incomparably
selfish, and completely amoral.

479
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,702
Hello?

480
00:33:56,802 --> 00:34:01,774
Hi. I understand Louise has been
calling you and I have to apologize.

481
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,543
Louise?

482
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:06,212
Louise Trenner,
the dean of Westcott College.

483
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:11,584
Oh, so that's what those
cryptic cell calls were about.

484
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:14,620
Little creepy hang-ups coming
in the middle of the night

485
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,817
waking me out of my deep slumber.

486
00:34:28,932 --> 00:34:30,737
- Hello?
- She will drain you.

487
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:34,807
- She will diminish your mental capacity to think.
- Who is this? Who is this?

488
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:38,308
She will render you useless
and you will suffer.

489
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,620
- Pegeen told me where you live.
- Is this Louise?

490
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,254
- You stay away from her.
- Louise?

491
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,630
- Yes.
- I know she's there.

492
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,598
Why won't you put her on the phone?
Put her on the phone right now.

493
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:09,241
- Hello? Hello?
- Where is she? I just want to see her.

494
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,535
- Louise, just...
- I just... I just need to see her.

495
00:35:11,635 --> 00:35:13,312
- What are...
- I just... just need to talk to her.

496
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:15,331
- I just need to look into her eyes...
- What are you doing?

497
00:35:15,431 --> 00:35:19,382
...and just ask her why.
Just ask her why.

498
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,448
Are you alone?

499
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:26,458
Oh, God. Oh.

500
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,673
- Are you alone?
- I'm sorry. I'm alone.

501
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,966
Okay. Miss...

502
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:37,069
- Miss Trenner, I presume?
- Yes. And you...

503
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:39,471
You're older than I thought.

504
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,741
- What do you think you're doing here?
- I know. I'm trespassing.

505
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,898
Could you lower your gun, please?
You're making me very nervous.

506
00:35:45,998 --> 00:35:48,915
You're making me very nervous.
You're peeping into my house.

507
00:35:49,015 --> 00:35:52,417
I just wanted to see where
she was going every weekend.

508
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,991
She...

509
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:59,058
she told me she'd be with me forever
and then three weeks later she was gone.

510
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:03,796
I don't know why she left you for me.

511
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:05,931
- Don't you?
- No, I don't.

512
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,734
You're beautiful. You're gorgeous.
You're a valkyrie.

513
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,037
What am I? I'm an old man.

514
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:12,696
True.

515
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,742
Good. Why don't you come
inside for a minute?

516
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,144
Why? So you could seduce me, too?

517
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:22,119
Is that your specialty, Mr. Axler,
converting lesbians?

518
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:26,966
Madam, it is not I who is trespassing.

519
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:29,655
It is not I who is a Peeping Tom.

520
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:34,689
It is not I who is making anonymous
phone calls in the middle of the night

521
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:38,030
- asking for a "Mr. Famous."
- Oh, God.

522
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,301
- Is she worth all this?
- No. She's not even that beautiful.

523
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:44,776
- She's not that intelligent.
- Okay.

524
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:50,009
She's unusually childish for her age.
She's just a kid, really.

525
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,177
So, why don't you come inside?

526
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,184
Why do you want me to step inside?

527
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,050
Because of the triumph it would
be to sleep with the woman

528
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,519
that Pegeen used to sleep with?

529
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,354
- Because I'm being polite.
- No.

530
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:06,956
- Because it's cold out and you...
- You want to fuck me.

531
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:12,098
You think you're safe, but you're not.

532
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:16,235
When she's through playing
with you, she's going to...

533
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:21,170
take you apart like a
cheap Christmas toy.

534
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:29,849
I was up for the position at Westcott
and Louise wouldn't give me the job,

535
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:33,652
so I met with her and then
I turned on all the charm.

536
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,062
I was desperate. I had to.

537
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:39,024
She wasn't going to give you the job?

538
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:42,294
- No, that's what I just said.
- I know, but why?

539
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:46,435
Had she seen you before?
Was it something about...

540
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,975
It was possible that I might not
have been the strongest candidate

541
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:53,775
that they were looking at,
but I had other things to offer,

542
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,580
which I let her know, wink wink.

543
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,312
She just wasn't going to give it to me.
I wasn't their top candidate.

544
00:37:59,712 --> 00:38:01,780
Well, how did... how did she know that?

545
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,284
I had heard it through
the academic grapevine.

546
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:08,320
It's academia, it's not the NSA.

547
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,147
- Why are you so obsessed with this, Simon?
- I just want to know. I just want to know.

548
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,712
Are you sure you don't like
me in my present uniform?

549
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,952
Let me just get this.

550
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:41,987
Why don't you go inside?
I'll meet you there.

551
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,555
Okay.

552
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,724
Yeah.

553
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,394
Yeah. Jerry.

554
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:51,997
Hi, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no. No more acting.

555
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:54,166
No acting. No, no.

556
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:57,837
No acting. I just...

557
00:38:57,937 --> 00:39:01,540
Why don't you get me a deal
writing my memoirs?

558
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,944
Well, isn't that what
washed-up actors do?

559
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,945
Why did you take her shopping?

560
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,348
I don't know.

561
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:15,009
Did you want her to become a woman
or just to look like one?

562
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:16,989
I mean, you know,

563
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:19,358
when you're enacting a role,

564
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,494
usually you dress accordingly.

565
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,483
Otherwise you confuse the audience.

566
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,727
Is that what she wanted?

567
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,068
I don't know. It's the way I saw it.

568
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:35,605
You've slept with her at this point.

569
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,609
I think so.

570
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,153
I don't know.

571
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,122
Yeah.

572
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:51,821
- Well...
- I like it.

573
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:58,597
Well, I guess this officially marks
the end of my 16-year mistake.

574
00:39:59,184 --> 00:40:00,834
Yeah.

575
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:05,902
Did she actually say "16-year mistake"?

576
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,475
I don't know. I'm not sure. I mean...

577
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,712
Or is that what you wanted to hear?

578
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:16,715
Well, I don't know. I'm not sure.

579
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:18,517
I mean, there's a lot of things she says

580
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:21,687
I'm not sure I'm hearing
what she's saying

581
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:24,723
or what I'm making up that she says.

582
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,259
I mean, I don't know.

583
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:30,596
Half the ti...
I don't know how she thinks.

584
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:35,067
I don't know what's on her mind.
She seems so detached.

585
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:39,504
She seems so removed. And yet...

586
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,906
when I'm with her,
there's a feeling I have.

587
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,678
- Yeah.
- It's nice?

588
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:48,447
You look a little bit like you're
still on the hanger.

589
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:51,049
I think that works though
because you can...

590
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,051
I feel like a matador.

591
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:54,720
What... what's it matter?

592
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,737
I mean, three quarters of the things
we do in life are mistakes.

593
00:40:58,223 --> 00:41:02,298
I mean, you know, my being an actor,
that's a fucking mistake.

594
00:41:02,398 --> 00:41:05,731
Could be. I mean, you get all
the awards, the accolades,

595
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:09,003
the special treatment,
all that stuff, the adulation,

596
00:41:09,103 --> 00:41:13,138
and what do you wind up doing?
Throwing yourself off a stage.

597
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:18,003
Now, come on. While trying to pull
some Hemingway-esque suicide.

598
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:22,648
I mean, you know,
the other day I'm watching television

599
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:27,632
and this commercial comes on,
and they're promoting Hemingway furniture.

600
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,988
I mean, here's a guy,

601
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:34,593
blew the top of his head off
because he couldn't take life anymore

602
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:38,997
and now you can get a
Hemingway bedroom set.

603
00:41:39,242 --> 00:41:43,099
I don't know why it makes me laugh.

604
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:48,773
You know? He wrote books, by the way.

605
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,207
I know you know that, but I'm saying.

606
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,114
She seemed pleasant.

607
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,453
Who?

608
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:04,487
The woman's that been here
from time to time.

609
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:08,560
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

610
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,395
There's been someone here, hasn't there?

611
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:14,500
What?

612
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,040
There's been somebody here.
Yeah, I have someone that comes in.

613
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,808
She comes in now and then,
you know, helps me.

614
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:24,870
With my...

615
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,369
- recuperation.
- Yeah.

616
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:31,783
- Is she a massage therapist?
- Oh, no, no. No.

617
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:37,153
She just, you know, has... Sometimes I
could stretch it for her, you know, she...

618
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,926
It's okay, though. It's fine.

619
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:43,862
Yeah. And she only just
comes here now and then.

620
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:45,843
It's not my business.
It's not my business.

621
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:50,068
No, no. I don't... No... it's...
it's fair to ask something like that.

622
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,335
I don't want to interfere.

623
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,343
She seems very pleasant.

624
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:00,112
Yeah.

625
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:03,115
Why? You... you've been talking to her?

626
00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:05,717
No, I just saw her.

627
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:08,387
- You just exchanged hellos and stuff?
- Yeah.

628
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:11,957
Nothing more than that. I mean,
you didn't ask her any questions?

629
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:14,493
- No.
- Just... just for my own...

630
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:19,131
- Well, I wouldn't say anything.
- Yeah, because... well, we like to keep it...

631
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:21,633
like we always keep it.

632
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:24,569
You mean me and you

633
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:27,537
or her and me and you?

634
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:34,346
- I really don't understand.
- I... I don't know, you said, "we".

635
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,248
No, I meant in the...
you know, in the sort of...

636
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:38,584
- In a general...
- In the general way.

637
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:42,921
Well, you should have someone
nice coming to take care of you...

638
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:44,621
at your age.

639
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:50,159
Good morning.

640
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,162
What?

641
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:00,161
Good morning.

642
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,541
Okay. Okay.

643
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,615
I don't have Alzheimer's.

644
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:13,352
I'm not demen... it's not dementia.

645
00:44:13,452 --> 00:44:16,154
It's something else.

646
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:19,258
It's this inertia

647
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:21,293
when it comes to the...

648
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:23,662
We used to call it "the work".

649
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:27,166
You see, so the abandonment is...

650
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:31,136
is so severe and it causes such pain

651
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:34,753
because... or it causes confusion,

652
00:44:34,853 --> 00:44:38,410
fear as I don't know where to go.

653
00:44:39,311 --> 00:44:42,781
Dear Simon, how are you? You look well.

654
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:45,917
I need to see you again.
You're my only friend.

655
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:50,222
Yours and hugs, Sybil Van Buren.

656
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:53,658
Hey. Look what I found.

657
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:56,761
The Seagull starring Simon Axler.

658
00:44:56,861 --> 00:45:00,932
Bootleg copy live from The Globe.
Can we watch it, please?

659
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,969
I found this woman and somehow

660
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:05,170
there's an appetite.

661
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,173
I know it's...
it looks like it's tentative,

662
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:10,775
It looks like it's going
to slip away from me,

663
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,411
but at the same time, so what?

664
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:16,915
I don't know what's right for me.
I don't know what's wrong for me.

665
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:21,987
I have no idea, nor does anyone,
really, when it comes down to it.

666
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,923
But I like that line from Shakespeare,

667
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:27,926
- you know, "Perdition catch my soul."
- "Perdition catch my soul."

668
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:30,727
- "But I do love thee."
- "But I do love thee."

669
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:32,932
And...

670
00:45:33,432 --> 00:45:35,871
when I love thee not...

671
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:40,269
chaos is come again.

672
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,941
Okay, I'm going to take that as a "no."

673
00:45:55,626 --> 00:45:57,190
Simon!

674
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,359
- Hi.
- Are you surprised?

675
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:11,169
That you're suddenly here in my woods,

676
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,505
on my property?

677
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:16,172
I'm surprised. Yeah.

678
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,152
I would rather speak privately.

679
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:31,790
Do you know of someplace
quiet that we could go?

680
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,480
Quieter than the woods? I mean...

681
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,563
The monster is all alone with them.

682
00:46:38,763 --> 00:46:40,299
Yeah.

683
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:42,167
That's terrible.

684
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:46,535
Have you... have you given
any more thought to my offer?

685
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,573
No, I haven't.

686
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,244
- Not at all?
- No. I haven't.

687
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:00,049
Okay.

688
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,643
Christening.

689
00:47:07,743 --> 00:47:09,328
So...

690
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:12,397
Oh, gee. What is that?

691
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:16,301
So, Edgar goes for a walk
in these gardens every night.

692
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,703
- Yeah.
- Okay, now, look... look, look, look

693
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:22,107
- how simple it would be to climb...
- No.

694
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:24,373
Simon, please.

695
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,479
Why are you doing this to me?

696
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,082
Because you're the only
person that I trust.

697
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,284
Trust? You don't know me.

698
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:36,288
- I don't know you. I just met...
- I know you.

699
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:40,892
You're asking me to do... such a thing.

700
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:42,994
- You understand?
- Yes.

701
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:45,430
Why would you ask me to do such a thing?

702
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,867
Because you have experience, Simon.

703
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:51,621
- What are you talking about?
- In the movies.

704
00:47:51,721 --> 00:47:54,239
I know, but the movies,
they're not real.

705
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:56,675
So that's not real experience.

706
00:47:56,775 --> 00:48:00,645
Okay, but you've held a real gun
and you've had training.

707
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:02,914
Not with real bullets.

708
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:06,818
Everything I do in the movies,
any actor does, is fake.

709
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:08,953
- You understand? It's not real.
- Yes. But...

710
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,622
- No, it's pretend.
- But...

711
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:11,657
It's pretend.

712
00:48:11,757 --> 00:48:15,160
But pretend that your acting background

713
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,199
will help when it comes time
to talk to the police.

714
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:24,503
- This is ridiculous. Ridiculous, ridiculous.
- Do not call me "ridiculous."

715
00:48:24,603 --> 00:48:25,904
- I'm not calling you...
- I am not ridiculous.

716
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:28,740
I'm saying this is ridiculous.
I am ridiculous.

717
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,044
I've been called ridiculous
by my husband, by my family,

718
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:35,547
by my friends, by lawyers, and doctors,

719
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:39,050
- and everyone else but you.
- Well, I'm ridiculous, too.

720
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,952
Simon, I just need your help.

721
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:43,689
I can't. I'm sorry, I just...

722
00:48:43,889 --> 00:48:47,025
- I'm begging you.
- I know, darling, but I can't do it.

723
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,327
You're going to have to go elsewhere.

724
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,731
Please. So, I have to go back anyway.

725
00:48:52,831 --> 00:48:54,232
- I got things I have to do.
- Back where?

726
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:56,167
- Well, I got to go back to...
- Where are you going?

727
00:48:56,267 --> 00:49:00,439
To my house and you go to
your house, wherever that is.

728
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,574
I don't know where your house is.

729
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:05,076
- I have no idea where you live.
- Do you want to come over?

730
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:07,246
- No, I don't want to go to your house.
- Wait...

731
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:10,849
You have to go elsewhere, you know.

732
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:14,286
I can't... I can't help you. I'm sorry.

733
00:49:14,386 --> 00:49:17,121
You're b... you're busy.
You sound busy, so we'll...

734
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,857
- We'll do this later.
- No, it's not about being busy.

735
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:20,920
- Right.
- Go... go... come...

736
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,850
you know, maybe another time.

737
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,196
- Later on, someday.
- Pick it up. Right.

738
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,705
Someday, long time from now.

739
00:49:27,805 --> 00:49:29,133
- Thursday.
- Maybe...

740
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,040
- Like Thursday?
- No, not Thursday. No!

741
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,904
- Another time. That's not Thursday.
- What?

742
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:35,907
- Thursday's now. I mean later.
- Simon, you're yelling. I can't hear you.

743
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:38,007
- Next century.
- What?

744
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:44,516
As time went on, I became more
and more dependent on her.

745
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:50,460
Always waiting for the sound of
that car on that gravel driveway.

746
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:07,105
- Hello.
- Oh. Hey.

747
00:50:07,305 --> 00:50:10,308
Oh. Look at this.

748
00:50:10,408 --> 00:50:12,644
- This is Emily.
- Aw, Emily.

749
00:50:12,944 --> 00:50:14,212
Hey, beauty.

750
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:16,145
- Here, let me take that.
- Thank you.

751
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:20,452
Oh. Oh, my God. Are you hurt?
Are you okay?

752
00:50:20,552 --> 00:50:22,353
Yeah. Gee! I got this.

753
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:24,990
Oh, no. Look at what happened to him.

754
00:50:25,933 --> 00:50:27,426
What's in here?

755
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:30,684
Just some of my things, isn't it, baby?
Some of my things.

756
00:50:30,784 --> 00:50:33,498
You know... I was thinking...

757
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:37,641
Don't you think it's time...
you told your parents about us?

758
00:50:37,741 --> 00:50:41,640
Oh, no, no, no.
My mother can never know about...

759
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,713
- What?
- Anything.

760
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:47,011
Why? What do you mean?

761
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:50,582
Even if the two of you hadn't had a
thing for each other back in the day...

762
00:50:50,682 --> 00:50:54,052
What thing? Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

763
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:56,921
I'm just saying I could never...

764
00:50:57,021 --> 00:51:00,258
I could not possibly tell her or him.

765
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:04,195
Oh, God, think of the look on
Asa's face. That would be terrible.

766
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:07,866
It'd just be way too painful, wouldn't it?
Oh, you want to go?

767
00:51:07,966 --> 00:51:10,913
- Let's get settled in.
- Yeah. I can't...

768
00:51:11,013 --> 00:51:14,070
- Thank you so much for trying to help.
- Thank you.

769
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:33,322
I'll be okay.

770
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,593
Oh, yes.

771
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,236
I've come to serve you.

772
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:49,205
- Is your back still hurting?
- No, dear. No.

773
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,344
It's going to pass.

774
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:56,114
This is how you played Richard III?

775
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:58,516
No, this was Igor

776
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:01,052
in Old Frankenstein.

777
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,744
Well, it's very convincing.

778
00:52:03,844 --> 00:52:07,624
Well, I got this far.
It's just getting it down

779
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,962
that I have to deal with. Oh, yes.

780
00:52:11,062 --> 00:52:13,332
Oh, yes.

781
00:52:13,832 --> 00:52:15,878
We have arrived.

782
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:20,138
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

783
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:23,207
I'm not going to make it to the bed.

784
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,442
That's fine.

785
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:27,279
So this will be an all-nighter...

786
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:29,414
of watching.

787
00:52:29,514 --> 00:52:33,451
And I'm going to read out loud to you
from the medieval miracle plays.

788
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:36,521
I'm in the middle of Abraham and Isaac.

789
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:40,458
Abraham's just told Isaac
that God told him to kill Isaac

790
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:44,395
and Isaac, weirdly,
is telling him that it's okay.

791
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:48,499
And he's saying,
"Ye have other children, one or two,

792
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:54,272
"which ye should love well by kind,
I pray you, father, make ye no woe."

793
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:57,373
- Hello, Mrs. Rutledge.
- Good morning, dear.

794
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,234
You saw a man by the water?

795
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:24,836
Yeah.

796
00:53:24,936 --> 00:53:29,440
Simon, you seem to have a lot of
people showing up on your property.

797
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,578
There's a guy wandering
around my property.

798
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:36,011
See? See there?

799
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:40,585
- You see him? Oh, my.
- Maybe it's a gardener.

800
00:53:41,085 --> 00:53:44,055
A gardener? No. He's a black man.

801
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,257
You wouldn't hire a black gardener?

802
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:49,460
Of course I would,
but I don't have a black gardener.

803
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,695
That's racist.

804
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:52,963
What?

805
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,800
- A little racist. Just saying.
- Racist?

806
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,836
Oh, so Pegeen was also there.

807
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:01,723
Yes, she was there.
I didn't mention that,

808
00:54:01,823 --> 00:54:06,018
but we went down to the little bridge,
that small little bridge by the river.

809
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:09,881
Oh, my God.

810
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:12,717
- Priscilla?
- Hey.

811
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:14,886
Priscilla?

812
00:54:14,986 --> 00:54:18,589
Priscilla? I thought you said
it was a man by the water.

813
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:22,527
Jesus. I can't even
look at you like this.

814
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:26,197
I needed to see for myself.
I needed to be sure.

815
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:29,167
- Sure of what?
- That you were sleeping with a man.

816
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:31,202
Oh, my God.

817
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:33,071
Am I missing something here?

818
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:37,408
Am I missing something? Are you
leaving something out of this story?

819
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,112
No, well, I mean,
they were talking about...

820
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:43,214
they were talking about health insurance

821
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:45,750
and that kind of stuff. Healthcare.

822
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:50,421
Also, how expensive the surgery was.

823
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:53,424
Are you all healed?

824
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,394
For the most part. I go by Prince now.

825
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,897
Prince? You got to be joking.

826
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:02,692
They were living, I mean, I think they...
they were dating for something

827
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:05,770
like six years. And at that time,

828
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:07,705
she was Priscilla.

829
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,672
And what happened then?

830
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:15,277
Well, come inside.

831
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,051
Simon, put the gun down.

832
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:23,886
- What is this?
- He's my ex-girlfriend.

833
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,132
How's Em... how's Emily?

834
00:55:34,232 --> 00:55:37,866
- She's good. She misses Amy.
- I miss her.

835
00:55:39,368 --> 00:55:40,571
Who's Amy?

836
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:43,340
Our other cat.
We had to separate them when I left.

837
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,340
Poor things.

838
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:49,514
Who sat with you during the surgery?

839
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,847
No one.

840
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:56,352
I wish I could say I felt sorry for you.

841
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:00,425
I'm not asking for your pity.

842
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:02,694
It was something I had to do on my own.

843
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:06,462
Not to say it wasn't lonely without you.

844
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,131
Still is.

845
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,971
What are you suggesting?

846
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:15,473
I miss you.

847
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:18,343
- And?
- And...

848
00:56:18,643 --> 00:56:24,379
I thought now that you're
sleeping with men...

849
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:27,419
why not me?

850
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:31,389
- I want you back.
- No, no. It's out of the question.

851
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:34,425
You just left so abruptly

852
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:37,261
after you found the pills
and looked them up.

853
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:39,964
I can't believe that you
actually went through with it.

854
00:56:40,264 --> 00:56:44,035
I can't even think
about it without cringing.

855
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:46,737
Breast removal? And not to mention...

856
00:56:47,442 --> 00:56:50,275
I can't even think about it.
I just cringe.

857
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:54,655
You mutilated the body I loved.
You destroyed the woman I loved.

858
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:59,917
Pegeen, please. Try to understand
from my point of view.

859
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:02,353
Whose point of view?

860
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:05,521
Prince's? I don't know you.
I don't know Prince.

861
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,593
The woman I was with doesn't exist.

862
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:16,501
Do you regret having invited him in?

863
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:19,070
You know something?
I don't know what's worse.

864
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,771
When I was here alone in my house,

865
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:24,375
I was so desperate, you know. And now...

866
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:30,507
I have these lunatics
showing up at my front door.

867
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:32,211
I think they know I'm here.

868
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,852
They smell me.

869
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:38,056
Open up.

870
00:57:38,756 --> 00:57:41,592
- Lower the window. Jesus.
- Oh, it's true.

871
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:44,461
- I've come to collect my daughter.
- Collect?

872
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:45,963
- Get out of the car now.
- No!

873
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:48,099
Get out of the car.
You're coming with me now.

874
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:49,834
- Stop it!
- Excuse me.

875
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:53,334
No! Pegeen.

876
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:58,209
Emily! Oh, my God!

877
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,509
- Emily!
- Who's Emily?

878
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:04,015
Oh, Emily.

879
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:08,486
Look what you've done.
You sad, pathetic, little old man.

880
00:58:09,289 --> 00:58:10,554
What a mess you've done.

881
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,657
- How did you find out?
- How did we find out?

882
00:58:12,757 --> 00:58:14,925
I got a call from Louise Trenner.

883
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:18,095
She began by saying she
was opportunistically

884
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:20,965
exploited and deceived by you.

885
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:24,302
- Is that true, dear?
- We have to go to the vet now!

886
00:58:24,402 --> 00:58:27,038
Just imagine what it was
like to get a call like that.

887
00:58:27,138 --> 00:58:30,108
I have absolutely no idea
what's going on in your life.

888
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:32,010
When did you break up with Priscilla?

889
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:36,280
When Priscilla decided that she wanted
to become a man, Mother, okay?

890
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,230
And you don't think that that was news
you want to share with your own parents?

891
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:41,419
What else have you been keeping from us?

892
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:44,722
Look, let's just get in.
What... is she all right?

893
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:47,425
Simon, you do not have a family.

894
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:50,961
You don't know what it's like to find out
who's sleeping with your daughter.

895
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:53,965
- Your daughter is a grown-up.
- Yeah, and you're ancient.

896
00:58:54,065 --> 00:58:56,734
How could you. Your own goddaughter?

897
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,469
I mean, I know you've
been having mental issues,

898
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:01,071
- but this is beyond insane.
- Get in the car, honey.

899
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:03,674
What does he have to offer you?

900
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:05,643
Is it money?

901
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:09,180
Oh, my baby. Oh, sweet baby.

902
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,484
You know, you look just so...

903
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:16,387
- beautiful and so...
- You mean feminine?

904
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:17,822
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

905
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:19,388
Feminine.

906
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,486
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, hi.

907
00:59:34,586 --> 00:59:37,008
Her leg got run over by a car.

908
00:59:37,108 --> 00:59:40,244
- Okay, let's take her in the back.
- Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you.

909
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:42,783
Oh, God. Not again. Oh, my God.

910
00:59:42,883 --> 00:59:44,795
I'm afraid you're all going
to have to wait out here.

911
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:50,287
Do you have anything that you could
give him? Like painkillers or something?

912
00:59:50,387 --> 00:59:51,656
- No.
- He's a person.

913
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:54,458
No, like what you'd give a dog,
but just for him.

914
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:56,893
Like ten times more or something?

915
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:01,532
I don't think we should tell
anybody about this, Mr. Axler.

916
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:04,635
And the muscle relaxers
start to kick in rather quickly.

917
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,305
Oh, yeah. A little discretion...

918
01:00:07,505 --> 01:00:10,105
will be much appreciated.

919
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:14,550
I think you're making a mistake.

920
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:20,215
You've been through a breakdown
that led you to being institutionalized.

921
01:00:21,518 --> 01:00:26,123
Now, I know that she's had these
fantasies about you since childhood.

922
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:29,194
I know she glorified you and she...

923
01:00:29,527 --> 01:00:33,127
cried about you and she...

924
01:00:34,098 --> 01:00:36,864
she dreamt about you, and she loved you.

925
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,403
And she's built up these fantasies.

926
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,976
How would you know?

927
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:51,882
What?

928
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:54,151
What did he say?

929
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,253
- How...
- What?

930
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:57,722
How would you know?

931
01:00:57,822 --> 01:01:00,658
How would you know? How would you know?

932
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:03,894
How do you know what he's saying?

933
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:07,131
How would I know what?
About my own daughter?

934
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:11,101
Because I'm her mother,
that's how I know.

935
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:14,769
That's how I know! It's how I know!

936
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,545
You're getting older by the day.

937
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,984
- Oh, really?
- You're 65 now.

938
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:30,020
And soon, you'll be 66.

939
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,957
And then, 67.

940
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:35,292
And so on.

941
01:01:35,936 --> 01:01:38,396
It never stops.

942
01:01:38,496 --> 01:01:42,675
And it won't be long before they're just
wheeling you around in a chair.

943
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:46,337
Well, if I had...

944
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:48,439
I have no idea what he's saying.

945
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:52,610
- If I had a child...
- What are you... what is he saying?

946
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:53,878
- What is he saying?
- What...

947
01:01:53,978 --> 01:01:57,114
Simon, do you hear her?

948
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,061
I know you hear her.

949
01:01:59,361 --> 01:02:01,285
- Yeah.
- And this is serious.

950
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,354
What is he saying?

951
01:02:03,454 --> 01:02:05,723
You will stop...

952
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:08,659
seeing our daughter.

953
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:11,328
- Yes.
- As of tonight!

954
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:16,541
- Yes.
- I never said I would not ever...

955
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:20,871
No. Simon. Simon, listen. Simon.

956
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:23,240
It's not going to be good for you.

957
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,876
Simon, it's not going to turn out well.

958
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:28,879
And it's not going to
turn out well for her.

959
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,581
You have to stop.

960
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:32,617
Okay.

961
01:02:32,717 --> 01:02:35,519
Pegeen started talking to
her mother more and more.

962
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:36,822
Click. Click the pen.

963
01:02:37,822 --> 01:02:40,758
No, everything's fine with my classes.

964
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:46,885
I don't know why she would take these
Simon-bashing calls under my own roof.

965
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:51,068
Okay. Anyway, well, love you, too.

966
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:53,868
Talk to you later, Mom. Bye.

967
01:02:58,507 --> 01:03:00,678
So, what did your mother have to say?

968
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:05,149
The usual. She thinks I'm starstruck.

969
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:10,754
Oh, but she couldn't stop talking about
how pathetic you were at the vet.

970
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:13,123
It's really her favorite topic now.

971
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:15,993
She keeps using the word "feeble."

972
01:03:16,093 --> 01:03:19,597
And then, she says, "He's a shell
of a man. A shell of a man."

973
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:24,240
It's really great. It's like a
whole new routine she's got.

974
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,971
I wish I was there.

975
01:03:27,371 --> 01:03:30,318
So, why'd you go upstairs?

976
01:03:30,418 --> 01:03:33,877
I was just looking around upstairs
when she called.

977
01:03:34,191 --> 01:03:35,846
- Looking around?
- Yeah.

978
01:03:36,046 --> 01:03:40,015
It's great. It's so big up here.
Why don't you ever use it?

979
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:45,422
I don't know. Just... I'm not ready.

980
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,859
What do you mean you're not ready?
You've lived here for 14 years.

981
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,662
Yeah, but I like it down here.

982
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:55,899
I like it. This is like an apartment.
You know, like a New York apartment.

983
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,168
It's like an apartment with a pool.

984
01:03:58,268 --> 01:04:00,938
Well, nothing... nothing's perfect.

985
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:03,298
So, tell me about your mom.

986
01:04:03,398 --> 01:04:06,221
I think it gives her something
to live for. Her hating you...

987
01:04:06,321 --> 01:04:10,114
Do you have any idea why she cares
so much about what her parents think?

988
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:11,916
A lot of animosity?

989
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:15,386
- No, but why does this upset you?
- Well, because it's upsetting.

990
01:04:15,486 --> 01:04:18,388
I mean, here she is... she's... she's...

991
01:04:18,488 --> 01:04:22,359
Shouldn't they be happy that she's getting
someone who's achieved something in life?

992
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:25,796
Who's done things, who's lived,
who can offer her something?

993
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:28,799
I mean, after all,
she's not getting any younger.

994
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:31,902
And why does she act like this?

995
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:34,405
You know, Pegeen and her transformation

996
01:04:34,505 --> 01:04:38,655
is like this orgy of spending
and spoiling.

997
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,911
And I'm out of money.

998
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:45,482
I'm just... I'm just, you know.

999
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,719
Simon, there's desperation
in your voice.

1000
01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:51,889
Well, I'm out of money,
I can't act anymore,

1001
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:55,625
and what am I going to do?
How am I going to keep her?

1002
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,626
You shouldn't have to
buy Pegeen's affection.

1003
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:02,700
What if I do?

1004
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,535
So I talked to your accountant.

1005
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:07,404
You're spending way too much
money on women's clothing.

1006
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:09,940
Way too much money on women's clothing.

1007
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:14,060
Do you have any idea what it costs
to heat a pool in Connecticut

1008
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,915
in the dead of winter? And on top of that,
you're giving her spending money.

1009
01:05:18,015 --> 01:05:22,086
I know I'm spending too much money.
What about the book deal?

1010
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:26,323
There's not that much interest.
There won't be enough advanced dollars.

1011
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:29,460
Oh. That's kind of depressing.

1012
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,931
Not that much interest in my life.

1013
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:37,101
Well, you're the one
who lost interest first.

1014
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:39,703
Maybe some commercials?

1015
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:41,575
Yeah,

1016
01:05:41,675 --> 01:05:43,896
we'll talk again.

1017
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:03,995
Hi.

1018
01:06:04,495 --> 01:06:06,637
Do you ever come out?

1019
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:09,166
You should come in.

1020
01:06:09,266 --> 01:06:12,403
I don't know, you know.
I don't think I'm dressed for it.

1021
01:06:12,503 --> 01:06:14,905
Yeah, but... guess what?

1022
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:19,343
You don't even have to be afraid
to swim because I'm a lifeguard.

1023
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:22,710
Certified. I could save your life.

1024
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,716
You already have.

1025
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:33,188
You already have.

1026
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,369
Who is it? Who is it?

1027
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:47,271
It's your agent!

1028
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:50,974
Look, Simon, be happy.
Your fan mail has really picked up.

1029
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:53,243
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean...

1030
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:58,148
I mean, they're all from the same woman,
this Sybil Van Buren woman, but still...

1031
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:04,021
They're going to offer you $150,000
to be the spokesperson.

1032
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:07,124
- You'll travel to Europe...
- Spokesperson? For what?

1033
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:09,326
For a new specialized technique.

1034
01:07:09,426 --> 01:07:12,429
- It's called a "hair-ation."
- Hair-ation?

1035
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:16,066
It's a special technique
developed by a Dr. Kingsley...

1036
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:19,136
- For?
- ...for everything in the general...

1037
01:07:19,236 --> 01:07:20,336
hair area.

1038
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:24,574
- So, a hair loss product.
- Well, if you put it like that...

1039
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:28,212
- Have you lost your mind completely?
- $150,000.

1040
01:07:28,312 --> 01:07:30,781
I don't care how much.
What does it matter?

1041
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:35,753
What about my dignity?
I mean, what little of it I have left.

1042
01:07:35,853 --> 01:07:39,323
Do something real then.
Take the role on Broadway.

1043
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:42,292
- What role?
- The King Lear role on Broadway.

1044
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,327
- King Lear?
- I've told you before.

1045
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:46,597
- I'm telling you again. The King Lear...
- You're telling me again?

1046
01:07:46,697 --> 01:07:48,832
- Yes. Yes.
- This is the first time I'm hearing it.

1047
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:51,068
No, it's... no, well, King Lear...

1048
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:53,837
They want you for King Lear on Broadway.

1049
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:55,039
Oh, they want me.

1050
01:07:55,939 --> 01:07:57,939
I mean, you love tragedy.

1051
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:03,113
How many times? What do I have to do?

1052
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:05,149
Do you want me to say it out loud?

1053
01:08:05,249 --> 01:08:09,353
There's a buzz about you.
They want to see you.

1054
01:08:10,153 --> 01:08:12,712
They want to see if you'll jump again.

1055
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:16,059
You know, like Spiderman.
People just went to see...

1056
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:18,095
Where they're flying around
on all those cables...

1057
01:08:18,195 --> 01:08:20,430
- if somebody would fall.
- Sort of like the circus.

1058
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,666
You've got to do something.
You have no money.

1059
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:24,301
I've become a freak.

1060
01:08:24,401 --> 01:08:26,070
- They're coming to see the freak.
- You got to...

1061
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:28,736
Get me a commercial that has hair in it.

1062
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:31,295
My hair.

1063
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:35,846
- Yeah. Yeah. Almost.
- Okay.

1064
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:38,515
- No cigar.
- Right.

1065
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,917
All right. Let me try one more time.

1066
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:44,952
You know, I don't think you should.
I think you should really just rest it.

1067
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:47,791
Maybe...

1068
01:08:48,091 --> 01:08:50,360
Maybe we try it on the side.

1069
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:53,294
- Let's just...
- Okay. Okay. All right.

1070
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,967
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, oh, oh no.

1071
01:08:57,067 --> 01:08:59,536
Oh, gosh. Oh, no.

1072
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:02,039
Oh, this can't...
this can't be happening.

1073
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:04,341
Well, it is.

1074
01:09:04,441 --> 01:09:06,810
Just give it a day or so, you know.

1075
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:11,081
- This thing has to loosen up, that's all.
- Sure. Sure. Of course.

1076
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:12,983
You know, because...

1077
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:17,018
sometimes it takes three days,
so I got one more day left.

1078
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:22,626
You know, I just got to get...

1079
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:25,696
I got to get into the
exercise part of it, you know?

1080
01:09:25,796 --> 01:09:28,866
Get into a routine
and just do it every day.

1081
01:09:28,966 --> 01:09:31,135
- Lie there, you know.
- Yeah.

1082
01:09:31,235 --> 01:09:33,403
Go through the stretches.

1083
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:36,611
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1084
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:40,438
You know that... that...

1085
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:45,883
horse tranquilizer that the vet gave me?
I mean, that... that was pretty good.

1086
01:09:45,983 --> 01:09:50,253
- Yeah, it was so good.
- Yeah, it turned out okay that night.

1087
01:09:51,234 --> 01:09:52,905
Yeah.

1088
01:09:56,894 --> 01:09:59,062
Anything I can do to help here?

1089
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,992
I don't think you fucked
the lesbian out of me yet.

1090
01:10:07,104 --> 01:10:10,040
Are you still sleeping
with women, Pegeen?

1091
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,509
- Just twice.
- Twice?

1092
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:15,048
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1093
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:20,258
- With Louise?
- Yeah. No. No. Don't be crazy.

1094
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:23,720
Well, with whom then?

1095
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,771
Just a couple of softball girls I found.

1096
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:34,664
This isn't a love story.

1097
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:37,467
This is an object of my affection, okay?

1098
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:42,039
A fucking cliche is what it is.
That's what I've become.

1099
01:10:42,139 --> 01:10:44,441
I'm a love cliche.

1100
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:48,446
She's a young woman.
That whole thing, you know.

1101
01:10:48,946 --> 01:10:52,622
At least she's a lesbian.
I wasn't that stupid.

1102
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:55,152
I picked the right one though, didn't I?

1103
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:57,955
I mean, this one's bound to leave me.

1104
01:10:58,055 --> 01:11:01,459
Bound to leave me, but you know...
I do deserve it.

1105
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:05,262
Everything I get, I deserve.
And you know what?

1106
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:07,934
I go into it with that open mind.

1107
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:11,117
Because fuck it. Give it to me.

1108
01:11:11,217 --> 01:11:14,739
Give me all you got.
I'll take it. I wish for it.

1109
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:17,472
I glory in it.

1110
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:24,948
Pegeen turned her last
girlfriend into a man.

1111
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:28,452
She turned me into a half-crazed beggar.

1112
01:11:28,552 --> 01:11:31,188
Who knows what she's turned you into.

1113
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:34,624
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1114
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:36,245
Yes.

1115
01:11:55,877 --> 01:11:58,515
Jerry, it's me.

1116
01:11:58,615 --> 01:12:02,368
- I'll do it.
- Really? That's fantastic, Simon.

1117
01:12:02,468 --> 01:12:04,822
I'll call the Broadway producers
first thing in the morning.

1118
01:12:04,922 --> 01:12:07,357
Ever since that swan
dive into the orchestra,

1119
01:12:07,457 --> 01:12:10,427
- they've been dying for you to come back.
- No, not King Lear.

1120
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:14,431
The... the other one.

1121
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:18,635
Yeah, don't sound
too enthusiastic, please.

1122
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:21,839
- No, I am. The hair product.
- Yeah, right.

1123
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:25,943
No, that's a good choice, too,
As long as you're back out there, right?

1124
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:29,076
Yes. Yeah.

1125
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:38,756
Dr. Farr, you're not
going to believe this.

1126
01:12:38,856 --> 01:12:42,714
- Sybil showed up again.
- What do you mean she showed up?

1127
01:12:42,814 --> 01:12:45,829
She showed up.
I'm on my way to the commercial,

1128
01:12:45,929 --> 01:12:49,166
she's there, she's in
my driveway in the snow.

1129
01:12:49,266 --> 01:12:52,036
She's just, she's just,
she's just stalking me.

1130
01:12:52,136 --> 01:12:54,905
- She keeps stalking me.
- Not again.

1131
01:12:55,005 --> 01:12:58,141
Simon, I'm a little confused.

1132
01:12:58,241 --> 01:13:00,574
Hold on one second.

1133
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:05,065
Come on out.

1134
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:11,072
Simon, I'm just looking at a
postcard Sybil just sent me.

1135
01:13:11,488 --> 01:13:14,413
She seems to be in Florida right now.

1136
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:16,226
Here.

1137
01:13:16,326 --> 01:13:18,560
- What's that?
- Money.

1138
01:13:19,462 --> 01:13:21,164
Money? For what?

1139
01:13:21,464 --> 01:13:23,400
You know damn well what it's for.

1140
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:28,153
I refuse to come near that.
Now, please stay away with that money.

1141
01:13:28,972 --> 01:13:32,376
- It's too late, Simon.
- Oh, yeah? And why is that?

1142
01:13:32,476 --> 01:13:35,178
Because you've already agreed
to kill my husband.

1143
01:13:35,278 --> 01:13:36,914
- You're an accomplice now.
- No. No.

1144
01:13:37,014 --> 01:13:39,758
- Yes. Yes.
- No. No, no, no.

1145
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:41,218
You saw pictures.

1146
01:13:41,318 --> 01:13:44,754
You are deep into this, mister.

1147
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:47,357
- You and I have an understanding.
- We don't have anything.

1148
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:51,127
You're going to be... you know the play
Harvey when he has an invisible rabbit?

1149
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:52,288
- Yes.
- That's what you are.

1150
01:13:52,388 --> 01:13:53,861
I will you out of my life.

1151
01:13:53,961 --> 01:13:55,332
- Great.
- You're willed out.

1152
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:56,900
Simon, I don't understand.

1153
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,985
Why are you referencing the play Harvey?

1154
01:14:00,085 --> 01:14:04,441
He was an invisible rabbit.
He existed in Elwood's mind.

1155
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,543
Was Sybil there?

1156
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:10,144
Or was she not there?

1157
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,383
Sybil's a stalker.

1158
01:14:13,483 --> 01:14:15,619
She's crazy.

1159
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:19,855
She somehow... all the fan mail
and every... she got it in her head.

1160
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:30,099
What are you doing?

1161
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:34,151
I am just trying to find
a place in your new life.

1162
01:14:34,251 --> 01:14:35,451
Well, there isn't one.

1163
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:38,306
Why can't there be?
We have a beautiful history together.

1164
01:14:39,109 --> 01:14:41,812
What does he have to
offer you that I don't?

1165
01:14:41,912 --> 01:14:44,981
I'm younger than him
and more attractive.

1166
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:46,416
And in some ways more masculine.

1167
01:14:46,516 --> 01:14:49,584
Enough, Priscilla.
I am not a heterosexual woman.

1168
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:56,193
I'll be right back.
I have to use the bathroom.

1169
01:14:56,393 --> 01:14:59,360
- Which... which one?
- Simon!

1170
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:01,962
What is wrong with you?

1171
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:06,737
I'm sorry. I'm just, you know...

1172
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:11,939
I don't see why we had
to invite your ex to lunch.

1173
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:17,680
I'm not going to do any commercials.

1174
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,580
I'm going to stay home.

1175
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:25,589
You're under no obligation to me
what you do when I'm not there.

1176
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:28,992
It has nothing to do with
the reality you and I share.

1177
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:31,561
That's indecipherable.

1178
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:34,711
So what about you? Are you going to take
a real business trip one of these days

1179
01:15:34,811 --> 01:15:38,018
to the stage or are you
just going to keep wallowing

1180
01:15:38,118 --> 01:15:41,644
in your own angst and self pity forever?

1181
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:45,475
I'm sorry, that was mean of me,
what I said back there,

1182
01:15:45,575 --> 01:15:49,579
but I don't want to be with somebody
who just gives up on his career.

1183
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:53,372
You don't have to go out there
every night, face an audience

1184
01:15:53,472 --> 01:15:56,153
night after night and lie to them.

1185
01:15:56,253 --> 01:16:00,354
I think you could try harder.
I think you could try harder for me.

1186
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:05,462
Show me the man
that is not passion's slave,

1187
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:08,565
and I will wear him in my heart.

1188
01:16:08,665 --> 01:16:12,430
Yes. In my heart of hearts.

1189
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:17,040
When the mind's free,
the body's delicate,

1190
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:21,578
the tempest in my mind
doth from my senses

1191
01:16:21,678 --> 01:16:23,546
take all feeling else.

1192
01:16:23,646 --> 01:16:25,212
Lear.

1193
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:28,683
Let go.

1194
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:37,761
What?

1195
01:16:37,861 --> 01:16:39,529
- Pegeen?
- Yes?

1196
01:16:39,629 --> 01:16:41,665
- She killed him.
- What?

1197
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:44,534
Sybil Van Buren killed her husband.

1198
01:16:44,634 --> 01:16:46,969
- I can't believe it.
- Really?

1199
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:51,004
Oh, God. She told me
I was an accomplice.

1200
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:54,778
We met at a mental institution.

1201
01:16:55,778 --> 01:17:00,483
She gets out of the hospital,
she comes to my town,

1202
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:03,853
she sends me letters,
she comes to my house.

1203
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,922
You know, she became a stalker.

1204
01:17:06,022 --> 01:17:10,216
And each time I told her, "Please go away.
I want nothing to do with this."

1205
01:17:10,316 --> 01:17:15,331
Mrs. Van Buren said that you encouraged her
to find someone else to kill her husband.

1206
01:17:15,559 --> 01:17:17,099
That's not the way I said it.

1207
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:20,334
But you did say to her, "You ought
to find a professional hitman"?

1208
01:17:22,103 --> 01:17:25,041
Well, yes. Well, yes, I said, but...

1209
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:28,044
Therefore you were encouraging her
to find a way to kill her husband.

1210
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,081
- You're twisting the logic. I'm sorry.
- Am I correct?

1211
01:17:30,181 --> 01:17:33,216
I don't mean, you know...
impose on your work.

1212
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:36,453
I mean, but that's not... Pegeen?

1213
01:17:36,553 --> 01:17:39,987
- I mean, could you help me here?
- That won't be necessary.

1214
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:44,628
- Okay.
- Were you sexually involved with Sybil?

1215
01:17:44,728 --> 01:17:47,130
No. Please. No.

1216
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:52,461
I mean, this is a young woman
in her early 30s at best.

1217
01:17:56,739 --> 01:18:01,676
No. I just... She was a misguided fan.
That's what she was.

1218
01:18:07,048 --> 01:18:09,420
Before you go, I want to let you know

1219
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,146
that I've been doing some
reorganization of your playthings.

1220
01:18:12,246 --> 01:18:13,308
- What playthings?
- Playthings?

1221
01:18:13,408 --> 01:18:16,660
- They shouldn't be left laying around.
- Yes, I agree, Mrs. Rutledge.

1222
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:20,397
Now, the... the mechanical
electronic devices,

1223
01:18:20,497 --> 01:18:25,091
the magic wand,
the G-spot vibrator, and the...

1224
01:18:25,191 --> 01:18:28,337
Jack rabbit, they should
be oiled at least once a month.

1225
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:29,572
- Yeah, right.
- That's true.

1226
01:18:29,672 --> 01:18:32,453
And the pigtail butt plug

1227
01:18:32,553 --> 01:18:35,506
and the... the double dong,
and the fisting mitt,

1228
01:18:35,606 --> 01:18:39,449
- they're going in the washer.
- You're absolutely right, Mrs. Rutledge.

1229
01:18:39,549 --> 01:18:42,182
- Have a nice evening.
- Thank you.

1230
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:49,023
- Thanks, folks. You have a great evening now.
- You too. Thank you.

1231
01:18:53,094 --> 01:18:54,728
I'm going to be right back.

1232
01:18:55,863 --> 01:18:56,899
Okay.

1233
01:18:56,999 --> 01:19:00,403
Oh, I should've known.
I should've known.

1234
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:04,305
The minute Pegeen got up from the table.
I should've known.

1235
01:19:08,344 --> 01:19:10,680
- No, really?
- Three times to quit.

1236
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,516
That's so cute to think
of you in a pick-up truck.

1237
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:15,552
- Are you ready?
- I love that.

1238
01:19:15,652 --> 01:19:16,986
- What?
- You ready?

1239
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:20,023
Oh, Simon. This is Tracy.

1240
01:19:20,123 --> 01:19:21,925
- Hi.
- Yeah. Hi.

1241
01:19:22,025 --> 01:19:25,061
Wait. Are you that actor?

1242
01:19:25,161 --> 01:19:27,730
Wow. You were really great in this movie

1243
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:30,300
that I used to watch
when I was really little.

1244
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:34,071
- What was it called?
- I don't know.

1245
01:19:34,171 --> 01:19:37,441
You know, the one with the tarantula.

1246
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:40,736
I've never made a
movie with a tarantula.

1247
01:19:41,043 --> 01:19:42,311
- Are you sure?
- No.

1248
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:44,814
- Yes he was.
- Isn't she adorable?

1249
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:46,420
Yeah.

1250
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,118
Shall we?

1251
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:52,388
Oh, actually,
we're having so much fun here.

1252
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:54,657
I can... could I get
a ride home from you?

1253
01:19:54,757 --> 01:19:57,360
- Yeah. Yes.
- With your truck? She has a truck.

1254
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,596
- I drive a truck.
- You can go on home if you want.

1255
01:20:00,392 --> 01:20:03,664
I'll catch up later. We'll be fine.

1256
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:31,327
- Hi.
- Hi, Simon.

1257
01:20:31,427 --> 01:20:33,630
Hi, girls. Have a nice time?

1258
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:34,931
- Yes.
- Yes.

1259
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:38,034
We had a really nice time.

1260
01:20:38,134 --> 01:20:40,170
Sure you did.

1261
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:43,907
I was going to give Tracy
the grand tour of the house.

1262
01:20:44,007 --> 01:20:46,175
Oh. Be my guest.

1263
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:49,209
- Well, I want you to come.
- Yeah.

1264
01:20:49,309 --> 01:20:51,349
- You know, go ahead.
- No.

1265
01:20:51,449 --> 01:20:54,219
I don't know. I'm doing all right here.
Why don't you do it?

1266
01:20:54,319 --> 01:20:57,554
- No, come. No, I want you to come.
- Yeah, all right. I will come.

1267
01:20:57,654 --> 01:20:58,989
- Yay.
- Come this way.

1268
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:01,024
Go down this hallway.

1269
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,094
What are we going to do?

1270
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:08,631
Take human playthings into our bed now?

1271
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:11,422
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

1272
01:21:11,522 --> 01:21:14,304
Come on. Don't be such a bore.

1273
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:17,304
Live a little.

1274
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:21,050
Look, I have something for you.

1275
01:21:58,782 --> 01:22:00,709
Hey, Simon.

1276
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:04,318
Still trying to think of
the name of that movie.

1277
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:07,524
What?

1278
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:10,824
I was going to give Tracy
a tour of the house.

1279
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,262
Okay.

1280
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:19,335
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

1281
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:22,069
- Bye.
- Isn't this great?

1282
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:26,243
Hello, Doc, hi.

1283
01:22:26,343 --> 01:22:29,875
You'll never guess...
the turn of events.

1284
01:22:31,847 --> 01:22:33,583
Well...

1285
01:22:33,683 --> 01:22:36,218
she told me that she...

1286
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:39,488
she wanted me to be
the father of her child.

1287
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:42,325
I never heard you
talk about a child before.

1288
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:46,563
I mean, Pegeen has been
planning our lives together.

1289
01:22:46,663 --> 01:22:48,665
Are you sure that's
what she actually said?

1290
01:22:48,765 --> 01:22:50,560
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1291
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:53,770
I don't like the sound of this, Simon.

1292
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:57,707
I want you to come in and see me
for a face to face session.

1293
01:22:57,807 --> 01:23:01,700
To be honest, I find the inconsistencies
of what you're telling me

1294
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,351
to be very disturbing. So, please,

1295
01:23:05,451 --> 01:23:09,285
come by my office.
Don't neglect this, Simon.

1296
01:23:09,385 --> 01:23:12,238
I'm very concerned about you.

1297
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:16,259
I'm Simon Axler.
I'm having my sperm tested.

1298
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:21,395
Well, this is dermatology.
Fertility is three flights up.

1299
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:25,465
- Have a seat.
- Thank you very much.

1300
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:29,019
I'm sorry I'm late.

1301
01:23:29,706 --> 01:23:30,907
I got lost.

1302
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:33,476
That's okay.
You're under so much pressure.

1303
01:23:33,776 --> 01:23:35,377
Yeah.

1304
01:23:35,818 --> 01:23:38,269
Well, here it is.

1305
01:23:39,048 --> 01:23:41,671
You know, I'm closing in on 70.

1306
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:43,353
That's still young.

1307
01:23:43,453 --> 01:23:47,459
When this child is 10,
I'll be pushing 80.

1308
01:23:48,057 --> 01:23:50,894
Who knows, by that time...

1309
01:23:51,094 --> 01:23:54,795
- I may not be your choice.
- You'll always be my choice.

1310
01:23:57,966 --> 01:23:59,970
Yeah. Well...

1311
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:04,105
That's good to know.
That's really good to know.

1312
01:24:05,608 --> 01:24:08,545
I'm going to be bald in a wheelchair

1313
01:24:08,645 --> 01:24:12,048
with this spine of mine.
Believe me, I'll be in a wheelchair.

1314
01:24:12,148 --> 01:24:15,617
And then what? Probably dead.

1315
01:24:17,019 --> 01:24:20,257
Maybe I'm not suited to be a father.

1316
01:24:20,757 --> 01:24:22,372
Maybe...

1317
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:25,092
it was too late.

1318
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:28,795
Another missed opportunity.

1319
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,903
I've missed so many in my life.

1320
01:24:34,003 --> 01:24:37,805
You know, I missed everything.

1321
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:44,914
Gave up my life.

1322
01:24:45,114 --> 01:24:47,812
You didn't. Here you are embracing life.

1323
01:24:47,912 --> 01:24:50,635
We're going to have a baby,
and you're going to get back surgery,

1324
01:24:50,735 --> 01:24:53,758
and we're going to be in love
for the rest of your life.

1325
01:24:55,158 --> 01:24:57,594
I can't believe...

1326
01:24:57,894 --> 01:24:59,896
that you're saying these things.
I mean...

1327
01:24:59,996 --> 01:25:03,566
I mean, that everything...

1328
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:05,969
would come to this. I mean...

1329
01:25:06,069 --> 01:25:09,003
Things would take on
this turn of events.

1330
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:15,578
Yeah.

1331
01:25:16,078 --> 01:25:18,281
Well, here I am.

1332
01:25:18,381 --> 01:25:20,950
Ready to go back to work,
resume my career,

1333
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:23,712
and if all goes well today...

1334
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:27,954
impregnate you. Right?

1335
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,294
I am old now.

1336
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:39,469
And these same crosses...

1337
01:25:40,369 --> 01:25:41,736
spoil me.

1338
01:25:44,505 --> 01:25:47,341
And these same crosses...

1339
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:53,713
Hello?

1340
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,650
Hello?

1341
01:25:57,485 --> 01:25:59,055
Who is this?

1342
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:01,107
I want to say some things to you, Simon.

1343
01:26:01,557 --> 01:26:04,294
- Carol?
- I want to say some things to you.

1344
01:26:05,294 --> 01:26:06,995
- What?
- And then I want you to stay away

1345
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:09,599
- from my daughter.
- Are you crazy?

1346
01:26:09,699 --> 01:26:11,934
Carol, I'm rehearsing here.

1347
01:26:12,034 --> 01:26:15,726
Do you have any idea what I'm
doing next week? I'm opening.

1348
01:26:15,826 --> 01:26:18,508
Having trouble remembering
your lines, Simon?

1349
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:23,346
It's not surprising since... Why should
you be able to remember your lines

1350
01:26:23,446 --> 01:26:25,912
when you can't even remember your life?

1351
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:28,800
What's that supposed to mean?

1352
01:26:28,901 --> 01:26:32,362
Do you remember what we were
doing the year before you and Asa

1353
01:26:32,462 --> 01:26:35,079
did Godot in New Jersey?

1354
01:26:36,092 --> 01:26:39,596
- We were doing a play.
- And Asa... what was Asa doing?

1355
01:26:39,696 --> 01:26:42,665
- Asa?
- Asa, my husband, your friend.

1356
01:26:42,765 --> 01:26:45,401
He was in the hospital.

1357
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:47,203
And what were we doing, Simon?

1358
01:26:47,303 --> 01:26:49,405
- We?
- You and I.

1359
01:26:49,505 --> 01:26:53,515
- We were doing a play.
- And what else?

1360
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:56,245
What else? I don't know what else.

1361
01:26:56,345 --> 01:26:59,757
- We were screwing, Simon.
- Okay.

1362
01:26:59,857 --> 01:27:02,419
That's what we were doing.
We were screwing.

1363
01:27:02,519 --> 01:27:05,054
Like rats or sailors.

1364
01:27:05,154 --> 01:27:08,191
Okay. We were just... I mean...
I don't know. It was...

1365
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:12,129
the play was one night.
We were drunk and...

1366
01:27:12,229 --> 01:27:13,797
No, no. Eight times.

1367
01:27:13,897 --> 01:27:15,665
- Eight times?
- Eight times.

1368
01:27:15,765 --> 01:27:17,634
- You were counting?
- It's in my diary.

1369
01:27:17,934 --> 01:27:21,034
Carol, this was decades ago.

1370
01:27:21,134 --> 01:27:24,974
What are you talking about?
I mean, you know, the play was over.

1371
01:27:25,074 --> 01:27:27,708
Yes, and we never
spoke about it, did we?

1372
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,480
- No.
- No.

1373
01:27:30,764 --> 01:27:34,150
And then I had the lovely
baby girl I always wanted.

1374
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,884
And Asa and I were... we were all right.

1375
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,823
Yes. It was a happy ending.

1376
01:27:41,023 --> 01:27:45,828
Except the lovely baby girl grew up
to be a rather eccentric creature.

1377
01:27:46,128 --> 01:27:49,532
A confused creature with
some troublesome traits.

1378
01:27:49,632 --> 01:27:51,765
You know, probably genetic.

1379
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:56,570
You should talk to her
father about that.

1380
01:28:00,809 --> 01:28:02,945
- Bullshit.
- My God, you're dense.

1381
01:28:03,045 --> 01:28:05,714
- Bullshit.
- You're so dense.

1382
01:28:05,854 --> 01:28:09,452
You know, whenever people write about
what a brilliant observer you are,

1383
01:28:09,552 --> 01:28:14,481
I tend to laugh hysterically. Have you
never, never noticed the similarities?

1384
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:21,964
- I don't believe you.
- I'll send you her DNA.

1385
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:25,700
God. It's such a shame that...

1386
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:28,469
King Lear died of a broken heart.

1387
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:31,207
What do you mean?

1388
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:35,210
Well, the ending could have been
so much more theatrical.

1389
01:28:43,852 --> 01:28:47,353
I knew you wouldn't have
the guts to do it yourself.

1390
01:28:53,994 --> 01:28:55,654
Good work.

1391
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,665
Good work.

1392
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:08,110
Simon, you okay?

1393
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:10,246
Oh, yeah.

1394
01:29:10,446 --> 01:29:12,212
That was good.

1395
01:29:37,173 --> 01:29:39,871
Hello, this is Simon. Leave a message.

1396
01:29:40,676 --> 01:29:42,511
Simon?

1397
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:44,711
Simon, are you li...

1398
01:29:45,447 --> 01:29:47,816
Oh, man.

1399
01:29:48,016 --> 01:29:50,353
I can't believe this.

1400
01:29:50,653 --> 01:29:53,222
They're waiting for the
freak to show up again.

1401
01:29:53,822 --> 01:29:58,060
Stop reading that. Seriously,
put it away. Those guys are jerks.

1402
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:01,862
You're going to be amazing tomorrow.
Don't read those people.

1403
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:10,273
And we, too...

1404
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:12,715
I don't know the words.

1405
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:15,475
I don't know the words.

1406
01:30:24,484 --> 01:30:26,542
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean what am I doing?

1407
01:30:26,642 --> 01:30:28,175
What's...

1408
01:30:29,558 --> 01:30:32,328
- What are you doing?
- I'm, like, five minutes late. Why are you mad?

1409
01:30:32,428 --> 01:30:34,630
This is... the car's been
waiting here for half an hour.

1410
01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:37,266
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

1411
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:39,101
What'd you do with your hair?

1412
01:30:39,201 --> 01:30:41,375
I don't want to talk about it.
It doesn't matter.

1413
01:30:41,475 --> 01:30:44,473
- But it looks different.
- Yeah, well...

1414
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:50,713
It's not easy for me to go shopping
for this kind of dress alone.

1415
01:30:50,813 --> 01:30:56,882
It's not easy for me to look into the mirror
and wonder if this is who I am now.

1416
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:02,591
Oh. So you choose this time
to have an identity crisis.

1417
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:04,793
- Yes.
- At this moment?

1418
01:31:04,893 --> 01:31:07,263
- Yes.
- Well, that's thoughtful of you.

1419
01:31:07,663 --> 01:31:12,835
Sybil Van Buren continues to express
disappointment with stage actor Simon Axler,

1420
01:31:12,935 --> 01:31:16,221
a friend, who, according to
Mrs. Van Buren, promised to help,

1421
01:31:16,321 --> 01:31:18,107
but never quite came through.

1422
01:31:18,257 --> 01:31:22,545
Mrs. Van Buren had accused her husband
of improper treatment of their daughter,

1423
01:31:22,645 --> 01:31:25,848
although she has never specified
what she meant by that.

1424
01:31:25,948 --> 01:31:28,017
She has said she won't
give any further comment

1425
01:31:28,117 --> 01:31:31,451
until she receives
a visit from Simon Axler.

1426
01:31:32,509 --> 01:31:34,122
Simon? Simon?

1427
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:37,994
Simon, please tell us, do you think
you'll be able to pull off this comeback...

1428
01:31:38,094 --> 01:31:40,763
- ...after your emotional breakdown on stage?
- I got to get backstage. I'm sorry.

1429
01:31:40,863 --> 01:31:43,332
- What's your relationship with Sybil Van Buren?
- I got to get backstage.

1430
01:31:43,432 --> 01:31:46,790
How do you feel knowing that he may
be involved with another woman?

1431
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:50,673
Repeatedly shown disregard
for anything I want.

1432
01:31:50,773 --> 01:31:52,074
What the hell do you mean by that?

1433
01:31:52,274 --> 01:31:55,077
- Are you asking for an example?
- Sure.

1434
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:57,474
You brought that girl to my house.

1435
01:31:58,074 --> 01:31:59,748
Did you consult me?

1436
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:01,917
What, I'm supposed to ask
for your permission now?

1437
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:05,754
Why don't you just suck the fun and
spontaneity out of everyone's life?

1438
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:07,290
Permission?

1439
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:10,425
You didn't even ask me what I thought.

1440
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:14,797
My opinion.
It's... the frustrating thing

1441
01:32:15,297 --> 01:32:18,534
is that I was so looking forward

1442
01:32:18,634 --> 01:32:21,103
to sharing my news with you.

1443
01:32:21,203 --> 01:32:24,340
That's... that's what's frustrating.

1444
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:26,008
What news?

1445
01:32:26,608 --> 01:32:28,108
"What news"?

1446
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:32,894
That's what I mean.

1447
01:32:32,994 --> 01:32:36,185
You know? That's what I...
You don't even remember.

1448
01:32:36,285 --> 01:32:39,121
Remember? I had a surprise.

1449
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:41,223
What is it?

1450
01:32:41,623 --> 01:32:43,926
Forget it. I... I... I...

1451
01:32:44,026 --> 01:32:46,662
It's just not the right time.

1452
01:32:46,762 --> 01:32:49,663
What is it?

1453
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:56,338
- I had my sperm tested.
- What the fuck?

1454
01:32:56,508 --> 01:32:59,241
I can have a baby. I can have a child.

1455
01:32:59,341 --> 01:33:02,075
- Oh, my God.
- I can have a baby.

1456
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,514
Are you kidding me?

1457
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:12,388
No. What's going on? What is this?

1458
01:33:12,488 --> 01:33:16,625
You gave me a pamphlet that tells
me that you can have a baby?

1459
01:33:16,725 --> 01:33:18,393
No, it told me I could have a baby.

1460
01:33:18,493 --> 01:33:22,531
- Where did you get this idea from?
- You. I mean you clearly wanted a child.

1461
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:25,234
No, I don't. I never said that.
I never said that.

1462
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:27,770
- You never said that?
- No.

1463
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:30,736
- Okay.
- I'm not ready. I don't want to.

1464
01:33:33,574 --> 01:33:34,877
Oh, well.

1465
01:33:34,977 --> 01:33:37,713
You know, you are something.

1466
01:33:38,013 --> 01:33:42,150
You know, I always thought
that you had it in you to be selfish.

1467
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:44,453
- What?
- But this...

1468
01:33:44,553 --> 01:33:48,182
This is, as they say,
it beats the clock.

1469
01:33:48,282 --> 01:33:50,758
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding
me right now with this shit?

1470
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:53,527
- That's all you are is about yourself.
- You come to me with your fucking brochure

1471
01:33:53,627 --> 01:33:55,264
that tells you you can have babies,

1472
01:33:55,364 --> 01:33:57,600
- I'm supposed to suddenly...
- The brochure doesn't tell me...

1473
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:02,871
Fuck this. You know what? Fuck this.
I'm not going to be someone I'm not for you.

1474
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:06,702
- I'm done pretending to be that person.
- What was I? What was I? Was I an experiment?

1475
01:34:06,802 --> 01:34:10,712
- I can't believe you're asking me this question.
- Was I some... some out-of-town try-out?

1476
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:12,922
What was I? Oh, you're leaving?
Oh, that's great.

1477
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:16,018
- Yeah.
- That's great. It's my opening night.

1478
01:34:16,618 --> 01:34:19,721
- Okay.
- I just can't... I just can't keep doing this.

1479
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:22,557
- I can't keep doing this act for you.
- I'm supposed to stop you from leaving now.

1480
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:26,295
- Is that it? Don't go.
- No. Please don't stop me from leaving.

1481
01:34:26,395 --> 01:34:29,131
I don't want you to stop me from
leaving because I'm leaving.

1482
01:34:29,231 --> 01:34:32,935
- No, you're not leaving. You can't do that.
- Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

1483
01:34:33,235 --> 01:34:36,238
- You're delusional. Seriously.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

1484
01:34:36,338 --> 01:34:39,641
Why? Because I turned you into something
that is close to being a woman?

1485
01:34:39,741 --> 01:34:41,610
- Oh, my God. Fuck you.
- Okay.

1486
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:44,212
- Fuck you and your show.
- Back at you. Back at you.

1487
01:34:44,312 --> 01:34:46,248
You know what?
I don't even... it's not even...

1488
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:49,851
- It's not worth it. Okay? Bye.
- It's not worth... Don't leave me. Pegeen.

1489
01:34:49,951 --> 01:34:51,787
- What?
- Do not leave this theater!

1490
01:34:51,987 --> 01:34:54,536
- You can't leave me.
- Yes, I can.

1491
01:34:54,636 --> 01:34:56,795
You can't leave me! I'm opening tonight!

1492
01:34:56,895 --> 01:34:59,200
- I'm sorry.
- I'm going out on stage!

1493
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:02,309
I'm going to do King Lear!
I'm doing Shakespeare!

1494
01:35:02,409 --> 01:35:03,965
- Did you ever hear about...
- Why are you yelling at me?

1495
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:06,068
- Why are you yelling at me like this?
- William Shakespeare!

1496
01:35:06,168 --> 01:35:08,738
- Oh, my God.
- I never want to see you again.

1497
01:35:08,838 --> 01:35:11,807
- This... this...
- Bye. You are a destructive force!

1498
01:35:11,907 --> 01:35:14,376
This is the most energy
I've ever seen you have,

1499
01:35:14,476 --> 01:35:18,080
- so congratulations, use it for Lear.
- Why don't you go in front of the house,

1500
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:20,449
in the audience
and you'll see real energy?

1501
01:35:20,849 --> 01:35:23,752
I wouldn't waste it.
I keep it for the stage.

1502
01:35:23,852 --> 01:35:26,522
I keep it for out there.
Go out there tonight and see me...

1503
01:35:26,622 --> 01:35:29,825
- see me and you'll see real emotion.
- You just keep telling yourself that.

1504
01:35:29,925 --> 01:35:31,894
- You know what? I am more...
- Real love!

1505
01:35:31,994 --> 01:35:36,758
...than just a baby maker, by the by.
I am also a professor,

1506
01:35:36,858 --> 01:35:39,055
- and a woman, and I don't give a shit...
- You're not a woman.

1507
01:35:39,155 --> 01:35:43,271
- what your weird, old man needs are.
- You're a... you're a baby pony!

1508
01:35:43,371 --> 01:35:45,707
- Oh, shut up, a baby pony?
- You're a furlong!

1509
01:35:45,807 --> 01:35:48,076
That doesn't even make sense.
You know what?

1510
01:35:48,176 --> 01:35:50,846
- I can't... I'm blowing my voice!
- I can't even believe people...

1511
01:35:50,946 --> 01:35:53,382
- I can't believe people are paying to watch you.
- I'm blowing my voice!

1512
01:35:53,482 --> 01:35:55,750
I would pay someone to not...

1513
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:57,823
- ...be with you ever again.
- You belong in a zoo!

1514
01:35:57,923 --> 01:36:00,622
You know what?
Good luck with your great sperm.

1515
01:36:00,722 --> 01:36:04,115
Come back! Come back!

1516
01:36:04,215 --> 01:36:06,659
Shane!

1517
01:36:07,494 --> 01:36:11,364
Come back, Shane!

1518
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:31,052
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1519
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:35,321
Let us away to prison.

1520
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:40,151
We two alone...

1521
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:44,199
will sing like birds in the cage.

1522
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:46,577
And...

1523
01:36:46,977 --> 01:36:49,905
when thou dost ask of me blessing...

1524
01:36:50,005 --> 01:36:55,244
I will kneel down and ask
of thee forgiveness.

1525
01:36:55,444 --> 01:36:57,110
And...

1526
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:03,282
so we'll live...

1527
01:37:03,751 --> 01:37:06,719
and pray...

1528
01:37:08,356 --> 01:37:10,323
and sing...

1529
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:14,060
and tell old tales...

1530
01:37:16,464 --> 01:37:18,368
and laugh.

1531
01:37:19,568 --> 01:37:21,351
And...

1532
01:37:22,251 --> 01:37:24,673
we will take upon us

1533
01:37:24,773 --> 01:37:27,643
the mystery of things

1534
01:37:27,743 --> 01:37:30,844
as if we were God's spies.

1535
01:37:34,582 --> 01:37:38,659
And we'll wear out, in a walled prison,

1536
01:37:38,759 --> 01:37:42,529
packs and sects of great ones...

1537
01:37:42,791 --> 01:37:46,592
That ebb and flow by the moon.

1538
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:54,801
We will take upon us
the mystery of things...

1539
01:37:57,405 --> 01:38:00,473
as if we were God's spies.

1540
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:08,627
A plague upon you, murderers...

1541
01:38:09,051 --> 01:38:11,218
traitors all.

1542
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:15,591
I might have saved her.

1543
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:21,471
Now... Cordelia, stay a little.

1544
01:38:22,298 --> 01:38:24,833
Her voice was ever soft,

1545
01:38:25,133 --> 01:38:25,999
gentle...

1546
01:38:30,271 --> 01:38:32,939
Thou'lt come no more.

1547
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:38,464
Oh...

1548
01:38:38,764 --> 01:38:41,915
thou'lt come no more.

1549
01:38:42,617 --> 01:38:44,343
Never,

1550
01:38:44,443 --> 01:38:47,689
never, never...

1551
01:38:47,789 --> 01:38:50,727
never, never,

1552
01:38:50,827 --> 01:38:52,427
never.

1553
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:08,677
I pray you, sir...

1554
01:39:09,321 --> 01:39:11,611
undo this button.

1555
01:39:18,553 --> 01:39:20,019
Thank you, sir.

1556
01:39:30,865 --> 01:39:33,099
Do you see this?

1557
01:39:35,102 --> 01:39:37,903
Look on her...

1558
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,577
Look...

1559
01:39:42,377 --> 01:39:44,444
her lips.

1560
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:50,049
Look there...

1561
01:39:52,753 --> 01:39:55,721
Look there.

1562
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:06,032
That's not in the play.

1563
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:12,875
This is who he is.
This is why he is who he is.

1564
01:40:12,975 --> 01:40:14,608
No, he's dying.

1565
01:40:16,843 --> 01:40:20,816
He's not dying. This is a genius.
You're looking at a genius.

1566
01:40:20,916 --> 01:40:24,052
I'm telling you,
the genius is killing himself.

1567
01:40:24,152 --> 01:40:28,490
There is no knife in this scene.
King Lear dies of grief.

1568
01:40:28,590 --> 01:40:33,226
It doesn't matter.
He's taking it to a whole other level.

1569
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:38,832
What the hell is going on here?

1570
01:40:48,442 --> 01:40:51,981
What comfort to this great decay
may come... shall be applied.

1571
01:40:52,281 --> 01:40:54,416
For us, we will resign.

1572
01:40:54,516 --> 01:40:59,184
During the life of this old majesty...
to him our absolute power.

1573
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:09,997
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

1574
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:49,237
Yes! Yes!

1575
01:41:49,537 --> 01:41:50,570
Bravo!

1576
01:42:07,988 --> 01:42:09,858
It's... it's okay.

1577
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:12,494
My lord... My lord.

1578
01:42:12,694 --> 01:42:16,598
- Look up, my lord.
- Vex not his ghost, oh, let him pass.

1579
01:42:16,698 --> 01:42:18,133
He hates him much...

1580
01:42:18,233 --> 01:42:22,805
that would upon the rack of this
rough world stretch him out longer.

1581
01:42:23,305 --> 01:42:25,795
He is gone indeed.

1582
01:42:26,341 --> 01:42:28,510
The wonder was he hath
endured so long...

1583
01:42:28,910 --> 01:42:31,724
he but usurped his life.

1584
01:42:32,681 --> 01:42:36,051
The weight of this
sad time we must obey.

1585
01:42:36,551 --> 01:42:40,456
Speak what we feel,
not what we ought to say.

1586
01:42:40,556 --> 01:42:43,859
The oldest hath borne most.
We that are young...

1587
01:42:43,959 --> 01:42:48,317
shall never see so much,
nor live so long.
