Well what does that mean?

113
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:57,014
Well it means that
she appointed me

to see that all of her
estate is dealt with.

00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,314

about your Aunt Edna?

No, like I said I
didn't really know her.

I just assumed she was dead

129

about her after that.

132
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,148
was because she was a lesbian.

- Well that's probably

it was much less
accepted than is today.

137
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,514
And when she finally
decided to come out

138
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:04,814
her family, your family,

139
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:07,314
essentially disowned her.

140
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:08,550
And she lived the rest
of her life ostracized.

141
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:15,714
Wow, I didn't
know any of that.

knew you'd feel that way

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:36,850
I don't know.

356
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,483
So is it a lot?

357
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,083
Here.
[paper crinkling]

358
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,150
Holy fucking
shit, is this real?

359
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,081
I hope so.

360
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,748
This is a lot of money!

361
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,848
- Yeah.
- What are you

362
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,516
going to do with it?

363
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:01,081
I don't know.

364
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,348
I can't think of anything.

365
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,581
I can think of
a million things

366
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,448
off the top of my head.

367
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,781
Hey Blondie, I don't
pay you to smoke.

368
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:09,081
Barely pay me at all.

369
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,048
The shitter's clogged.

370
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,814
- So unclog it!
- Now!

371
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:13,048
It's not my fucking job.

372
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,514
Get Sean to do it.

373
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:16,081
You know you're job

374
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,348
is to do whatever I
tell you to, got it?

375
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,814
Now get your boney ass inside
and unclog that commode

376
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:22,814
or you can take the day off

377
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,281
and go to your
kid's birthday party

378
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,814
and then the next
day, and the next day,

379
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:26,881
and every day after that.

380
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:29,214
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

381
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,948
Would you show the
lady a little respect?

382
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,781
You're using that term
"lady" a little loosely

383
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:33,648
don't ya think?

384
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,014
There you go again.

385
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:36,781
That's not nice.

386
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:38,381
You know what, why don't you
stay out of this all right?

387
00:21:38,383 --> 00:21:39,283
It ain't got nothing
to do with you.

388
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:43,681
I think it does.

389
00:21:43,683 --> 00:21:45,581
How'd you feel if I said
something about your mother?

390
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,581
What's that about my mother?

391
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,981
It's cool, I'm coming.

392
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:48,781
You better tell your boyfriend

393
00:21:48,783 --> 00:21:49,648
to watch his mouth.

394
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,814
He's not my boyfriend.

395
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:52,314
He's just a customer.

396
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:54,148
[Randy] Well she
may look doable,

397
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,914
but she ain't worth the trouble.

398
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,248
Well you've got a big mouth.

399
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,383
Oh yeah, you gonna
shut it for me, huh?

400
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:02,014
- Maybe.
- Trust me

401
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:03,448
this bitch ain't worth it.

402
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,783
Hey man, fuck you!

403
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,050
- Be cool!
- No, no, no, no.

404
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,981
She doesn't need this
fucking job Randy!

405
00:22:10,983 --> 00:22:11,848
- Oh is that right?
- Yeah I do.

406
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,148
No she doesn't, that is right.

407
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,548
So apologize to the lady

408
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,048
or stick it up your ass!

409
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,948
You know what, fuck you pal.

410
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,981
[scuffling]
[Randy thudding to ground]

411
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:22,548
Shit, what did you do?

412
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,548
I don't know.

413
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,881
It was an accident.

414
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:26,981
Ugh, fuck!

415
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:28,648
I'm so sorry man.

416
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,014
Ugh, you know what?

417
00:22:33,016 --> 00:22:35,048
You want her, you can have her.

418
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,448
- You're fired!
- What?

419
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,950
You can pick up your
last paycheck on Friday.

420
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,450
Ya happy, shit! [groaning]

421
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:53,283
Okay, what the
hell just happened?

422
00:22:54,983 --> 00:22:56,114
I don't know.

423
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:57,016
Did you just get me fired?

424
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,814
I think so.

425
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:03,448
Asshole, I need
this fucking job!

426
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,381
Not matter how much a
douchebag my boss is!

427
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,748
I don't have the
grandmas leaving me

428
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,981
a bajillion dollars.

429
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:09,481
It was my aunt actually.

430
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:09,816
- What?
- It was

431
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,348
my Great-aunt Edna.

432
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,681
I don't give a
flip who she was.

433
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:15,216
She didn't leave me a dime!

434
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,148
Fuck, I gotta go.

435
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,016
Good luck with your
new found fortune.

436
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:26,948
- Hey Jess?
- What now man?

437
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,214
You wanna call social services

438
00:23:28,216 --> 00:23:28,916
and take my kid away too?

439
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,283
Can I get a ride?

440
00:23:34,383 --> 00:23:37,781
Seriously, you
just got me fired!

441
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,114
You know that right?

442
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:41,316
And you have the balls to
ask me for a ride home?

443
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:45,614
Well see the last bus
came by a minute ago

444
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:47,816
and so I'm kinda stuck.

445
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:50,216
Get in.

446
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,848
[elevator bell rings]

447
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,114
Oh, this is my floor.

448
00:23:58,116 --> 00:23:59,848
I'm really, really sorry.

449
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,414
I feel terrible.

450
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,581
Whatever man,
it was just a job.

451
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:07,183
Okay, well good night.

452
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,416
[Jess sighs]

453
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:18,681
You live on this floor?

454
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:20,914
No shit Sherlock!

455
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,983
[door slams]

456
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,548
I'm gonna make it up to you.

457
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:26,883
[Jess] Fuck you!

458
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,016
[door squeaks]
[serious music]

459
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:43,783
Somebody in here?

460
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:56,948
If someone's in here

461
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,383
I'm gonna bash your head in!

462
00:24:58,783 --> 00:25:00,550
[rattling]

463
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:19,148
[clattering]
Arg!

464
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,881
Who the fuck are you?

465
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:22,648
- Ryder.
- What are

466
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,014
you doing here?

467
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:25,681
[Ryder] Playing
with my trucks?

468
00:25:25,683 --> 00:25:26,216
How did you get in here?

469
00:25:28,816 --> 00:25:31,116
[toilet flushing]

470
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,048
Hey, watch your
fucking language

471
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,181
around your nephew.

472
00:25:39,183 --> 00:25:41,281
Missy what the hell?

473
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:43,081
I almost bashed
this kid's head off!

474
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,016
Well that's no
way to treat family.

475
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:48,014
How the hell did
you get in here?

476
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:50,448
Mom gave me your spare key.

477
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,514
Great, now I've got
the change the locks.

478
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:52,981
Not that I can afford it.

479
00:25:52,983 --> 00:25:54,981
That's not what I hear.

480
00:25:54,983 --> 00:25:56,181
What is that supposed to mean?

481
00:25:56,183 --> 00:25:58,114
Cut the shit Casey.

482
00:25:58,116 --> 00:26:00,214
I know about the money.

483
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:02,081
Oh, I was wondering how long

484
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,448
it would take till you
came slithering in.

485
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,581
What's wrong, husband
number three's

486
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,548
not paying your rent anymore?

487
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,148
No, he left Ryder and
me a few months ago.

488
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,781
But that's not the point.

489
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:12,548
Oh there's a point?

490
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,948
Come on Casey, we're family.

491
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,914
You don't turn your
back on family.

492
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:19,181
Oh we're family now?

493
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:20,748
Okay where was
family what dad died

494
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,081
and mom went off her meds

495
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,814
and didn't feed
me for four days?

496
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,681
Oh that's right,
you split, right?

497
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:28,481
Family my ass!

498
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:30,548
That's not fair Casey.

499
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,014
You're not the only
one who had to put up

500
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:31,550
with mom's shit!

501
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:37,081
How much do you need?

502
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,448
- Half!
- Half?

503
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,914
Yeah, my share.

504
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:41,981
Your share?

505
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:43,914
The fucking balls on you!

506
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:45,848
Everything about you it's just,

507
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,948
it's just ugly.

508
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,114
You're right I'm
sorry, forgive me.

509
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:51,248
I know I've been
a shitty sister.

510
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,883
And right now, I could
really use your help.

511
00:26:54,383 --> 00:26:55,881
So what do ya say?

512
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:56,516
Can you help your big sis out?

513
00:27:00,283 --> 00:27:02,114
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

514
00:27:02,116 --> 00:27:02,550
I will think about it.

515
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,714
How much do ya need
just to get by?

516
00:27:08,716 --> 00:27:10,081
- Half.
- Get out.

517
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,414
- What?
- I cant' believe

518
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:12,414
for a second I
fucking fell for that.

519
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:13,714
I lost my mind.

520
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,514
For a second I actually thought

521
00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:17,248
you might have a sincere
bone in your body.

522
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,381
Okay, I could give you money

523
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:20,114
but that's just like
pissing it away.

524
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:20,814
Because you'll either
snort it or smoke it,

525
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:23,148
whatever the fuck
you're into now.

526
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,581
Screw you and your high
and mighty moral authority!

527
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,081
This is just like you Casey.

528
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,848
You think you're so perfect!

529
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,948
God's gift to the fucking world!

530
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,848
Well if you're so
god damn special

531
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,714
why did you drop
out of college, huh?

532
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:36,748
Because I had to take care

533
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,481
of our train wreck of a mother

534
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:40,014
while you banged your way
though the whitepages,

535
00:27:40,016 --> 00:27:41,348
you're welcome by the way.

536
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,181
Yeah, well if you're
such an amazing son,

537
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:43,981
did you even know
that your mother

538
00:27:43,983 --> 00:27:45,914
is missing again?

539
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,814
Missing, what do you mean?

540
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:48,816
Missing, like all
the other times!

541
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,014
Shit, how long?

542
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:57,514
What am I, her parole officer?

543
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:58,248
She'll turn up, all right?

544
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,314
She always does.

545
00:28:00,316 --> 00:28:03,048
Whatever, you can't keep
me from that money Casey.

546
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,481
It's just as much
mine as it yours.

547
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,181
Get out, and take your
shitty kid with you.

548
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:09,848
Fine, but you know what?

549
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,581
I'm gonna call my own lawyer

550
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,081
and I'll get my share!

551
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,414
And you know what else?

552
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:16,548
I hope you choke on
all the lobster dinners

553
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,481
you buy with my money asshole!

554
00:28:18,483 --> 00:28:19,383
Suck dick and die!

555
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:21,983
Classy as always.

556
00:28:23,816 --> 00:28:25,348
[door slams]

557
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,681
What the fuck?

558
00:28:26,683 --> 00:28:28,383
[panting]

559
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,881
Sorry you had to
hear all that kid.

560
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,250
It's okay, she
yells at everybody.

561
00:28:44,816 --> 00:28:45,416
Sorry I called you shitty.

562
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:47,483
You seem pretty cool.

563
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,881
Hey, don't
fuckin' talk to son.

564
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:53,481
Let's go Ryder!

565
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,150
Let's go!

566
00:28:56,883 --> 00:28:57,250
[Ryder] Bye.

567
00:29:01,383 --> 00:29:03,250
[door slams]

568
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,648
[Casey sighs]

569
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,550
[quiet music]

570
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,214
Like I was sayin'
darling your job is kinda...

571
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:23,014
Whoa, whoa, I don't
want any trouble man.

572
00:29:23,016 --> 00:29:25,048
No, no trouble,
I just wanna talk.

573
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,448
We ain't got
nothin' to talk about.

574
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,014
Yeah we do, Jess.

575
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:29,781
I want you to give her

576
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:31,348
her job back.

577
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,514
See I knew you
were boning her.

578
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:36,414
I'm not boning her.

579
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:37,581
Okay, I just feel shitty

580
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,881
about gettin' her fired.

581
00:29:38,883 --> 00:29:39,748
If you wanna get
pissed at someone

582
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,781
be pissed at me, but not Jess.

583
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:42,181
She's got a kid to feed.

584
00:29:42,183 --> 00:29:43,614
Well she should have
thought about that

585
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,216
before she went and sicced
her crazy boyfriend on me.

586
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:48,181
What is your malfunction?

587
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:50,314
I'm not her boyfriend.

588
00:29:50,316 --> 00:29:51,516
Okay, I'm just
sayin' guy to guy,

589
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:53,383
do the right thing.

590
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:56,416
You really got it
for her don't ya?

591
00:29:59,516 --> 00:30:00,881
I don't know.

592
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,214
What if I do?

593
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:04,083
Ah, see I knew it, still no.

594
00:30:05,516 --> 00:30:07,648
Why not?

595
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,916
Look man, I just hired
a new girl all right?

596
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,850
And a fine lookin' one at that.

597
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,981
Look, I'll make
it worth your while.

598
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,016
Dude I don't fuckin'
swing that way bro!

599
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:22,981
No, I mean...

600
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:23,914
Why the fuck does
everyone think I'm gay?

601
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:24,816
I'm talking about money.

602
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:28,714
I'll give you money.

603
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:30,350
Oh yeah, how much we talkin'?

604
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:32,850
Name your price.

605
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:37,881
Well it's gonna cost you.

606
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:39,714
I mean after all the
shit she put me through?

607
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:41,748
- Okay.
- I have damages you know,

608
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,850
emotionally and
punitively and what not.

609
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:45,950
How much?

610
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,848
- Five.
- Five, come one

611
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,381
that's a little steep.

612
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:55,714
I'll give you two.

613
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:56,848
You asked me my price.

614
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,481
That's my price.

615
00:30:58,483 --> 00:30:59,714
Okay, five, come on

616
00:30:59,716 --> 00:31:00,681
that's highway robbery.

617
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:03,414
I'll give you three.

618
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,614
Hey, you're supposed
to be the big shot here.

619
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:09,214
If you can't swing $500 then

620
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:12,748
I got three words
for your girlfriend.

621
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,448
Whoa, whoa, you said 500?

622
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,483
Did I stutter?

623
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,081
Okay, all right you
drive a hard bargain.

624
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:21,450
But all right five.

625
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:24,950
Paid in full.

626
00:31:27,283 --> 00:31:28,281
See that's what
I'm talkin' about.

627
00:31:28,283 --> 00:31:29,781
All right so you'll call Jess

628
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:30,914
and tell her she can come back?

629
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:33,814
Yeah, just as
soon as you leave.

630
00:31:33,816 --> 00:31:36,648
Okay, thank you Randy.

631
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,148
I appreciate it.

632
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,216
Yeah, yeah, pleasure
doin' business with ya.

633
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:42,416
Sucker.

634
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,848
See that?

635
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,781
- Respect.
- Yeah.

636
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:51,016
[laughing] Ow, shit.

637
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,983
[knocking on door]

638
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:08,216
- Hey.
- Hey.

639
00:32:09,816 --> 00:32:11,681
What's up?

640
00:32:11,683 --> 00:32:14,148
So sorry about
the other night.

641
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,148
I was kind of a bitch.

642
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,414
No I had it coming.

643
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,216
Yeah you did actually.

644
00:32:21,216 --> 00:32:23,848
But Randy called, said I
could come back to work.

645
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,848
Oh yeah?

646
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,981
Well that's cool.

647
00:32:26,983 --> 00:32:27,916
Cut the shit, he
told me you came by.

648
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:30,516
It was no big deal.

649
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:33,414
I don't know what
you said to him

650
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:35,748
but thanks.

651
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,248
He was actually really cool.

652
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,748
Its the least I could do.

653
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,614
It was kinda my
fault you got fired.

654
00:32:41,616 --> 00:32:43,116
No it was 100% your fault.

655
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,916
What did you say to him anyway?

656
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,881
Nothing really.

657
00:32:49,883 --> 00:32:51,150
He was a pretty reasonable guy.

658
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:53,850
Now I know you're
a fucking liar.

659
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:57,314
Anyway I owe you one.

660
00:32:57,316 --> 00:32:59,848
So if there's anything
I can do for you

661
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,216
just let me know.

662
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:07,748
Now that you mention it?

663
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,283
That was fast.

664
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,383
There is something I
could use your help with.

665
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:24,183
Well what are you waiting for?

666
00:33:27,983 --> 00:33:28,383
I don't know.

667
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:30,983
You look terrified.

668
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,816
- I am.
- Why?

669
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,216
[sighs] I'm afraid of
what I might find inside.

670
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:55,883
[Casey sighs]

671
00:33:58,616 --> 00:34:00,514
[knocks on door]
Ma?

672
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:01,250
Ma open the door it's me.

673
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,250
[sighs]

674
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,316
[rattles door]

675
00:34:37,183 --> 00:34:37,516
Ma?

676
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:40,350
Do you see anything?

677
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,550
[Casey] I can't tell.

678
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,714
That could be her body
inside on the floor.

679
00:34:46,716 --> 00:34:49,214
Body, whoa time out!

680
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,648
You think there might
be a dead body in there?

681
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,383
Your mom's dead body?

682
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,981
It's possible.

683
00:34:53,983 --> 00:34:54,881
Okay, I'm tagging out.

684
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:56,081
I'll be in the car.

685
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:58,148
- Why?
- You didn't say

686
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,083
anything about a dead body!

687
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:02,850
To be fair I didn't say
that there wouldn't be one.

688
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:05,116
- Right.
- C'mon

689
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,350
think of it as an adventure.

690
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:10,016
[sighs] Fuck me.

691
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,516
[serious music]

692
00:35:47,983 --> 00:35:49,348
Is that a foot?

693
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,416
[serious music]

694
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,950
That seems to
be the situation.

695
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,016
Oh man, oh man.

696
00:36:05,716 --> 00:36:06,116
Oh thank god.

697
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:08,883
Wait is your mom an amputee?

698
00:36:10,316 --> 00:36:12,514
No. [sighs]

699
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:13,516
Then why does she
have a prosthetic leg?

700
00:36:16,483 --> 00:36:16,883
I don't know.

701
00:36:18,883 --> 00:36:21,014
[thumping]

702
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:21,483
What is that?

703
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:26,483
Wait you don't know
what's in there.

704
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:30,350
Well only one way to find out.

705
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:34,883
[thumping]

706
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,983
[dog barking]
Sammie!

707
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,083
Hey buddy!

708
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:58,881
[kibble rattling]

709
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,148
[Jess] Oh my god
it must be starving.

710
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,814
What kind of person leaves a dog

711
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:02,883
locked up with no food or water?

712
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:06,014
The kind of person
that doesn't remember

713
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:06,850
she has a dog.

714
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:09,250
What do you mean?

715
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:15,150
My mom is a little special.

716
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,550
Special how?

717
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,050
She has trouble coping
with life sometimes.

718
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:24,916
Don't we all?

719
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:27,850
Not like Dorthy.

720
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,481
Well what makes
her so special,

721
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,514
besides her
impressive collection

722
00:37:33,516 --> 00:37:35,150
of celebrity gossip rags?

723
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,450
My mother's psychotic.

724
00:37:42,316 --> 00:37:43,114
[Jess] Yeah well
join the club.

725
00:37:43,116 --> 00:37:44,016
My mom can be a real bitch too.

726
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:49,050
My mom's tried to kill me.

727
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,216
- I'm sure,
- 11 times.

728
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:54,516
What?

729
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,714
She suffers from
paranoid schizophrenia

730
00:37:59,716 --> 00:38:00,416
and bipolar disorder.

731
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,514
[Jess] You mean like
multiple personalities?

732
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:07,848
No, she sees and
hears things sometimes.

733
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,981
Like ghosts?

734
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:13,948
No, like she thinks
things are happening

735
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,250
or going to happen to her.

736
00:38:17,783 --> 00:38:19,248
This one time when I was 13,

737
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,581
there was this commercial

738
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:21,316
with the starving kids?

739
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:24,748
You know the one
for 50 cents a day,

740
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,450
you too can feed the children?

741
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:29,914
Anyway she thought the
guy in the commercial

742
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:32,381
was talking directly to her.

743
00:38:32,383 --> 00:38:34,414
And he was telling her that
is wasn't fair for her,

744
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:36,150
or us, to eat when there were
children dying of hunger.

745
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,083
So one time we
didn't eat for days.

746
00:38:40,816 --> 00:38:43,914
- Shit.
- Yeah.

747
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:46,114
Then one day I came
home from school

748
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,481
and the pantry, which had been
completely empty for days,

749
00:38:48,483 --> 00:38:49,881
was suddenly stocked
with more food

750
00:38:49,883 --> 00:38:51,581
than we've ever had in there.

751
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:54,281
I thought, "Great, she'd
come to her senses."

752
00:38:54,283 --> 00:38:56,614
So I start makin' myself a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich

753
00:38:56,616 --> 00:38:59,048
and she comes into
the kitchen screaming

754
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,348
about how the food
is for the children.

755
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,014
And I'm like, "I
am your children."

756
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:02,314
[scary music]

757
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:04,014
And she grabs a butcher knife,

758
00:39:04,016 --> 00:39:06,748
[scary music]

759
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,116
and she stabs me
right in the forearm.

760
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:11,016
That's messed up.

761
00:39:13,116 --> 00:39:14,150
Just another day in paradise.

762
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:18,948
So what happened
with your mom?

763
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,883
She just snapped out of it?

764
00:39:22,216 --> 00:39:23,414
The neighbors
heard all the yelling

765
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:24,981
and called the cops.

766
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:27,114
They issued a 5150.

767
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,516
It's a 72-hour psychiatric hold.

768
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:33,014
They took her to the nut house

769
00:39:33,016 --> 00:39:34,081
and pumped her full of lithium

770
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,550
so she was mom again.

771
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,581
At least for a little while.

772
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:40,814
And that was the first time

773
00:39:40,816 --> 00:39:42,383
something like that happened?

774
00:39:44,016 --> 00:39:45,381
[Casey] I wish.

775
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,014
That was the fifth
time she was committed.

776
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:49,048
But is was the first time

777
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,050
I ever saw someone tase my mom.

778
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:53,216
[Jess] Shit.

779
00:39:56,316 --> 00:39:57,281
[Casey] Yeah well
you come at the cops

780
00:39:57,283 --> 00:40:00,048
with a bloody butcher knife.

781
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,281
I guess I'm lucky they
just didn't shoot her.

782
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:05,350
[child's distorted laughter]

783
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:12,781
So what now, should we
call the cops or something?

784
00:40:12,783 --> 00:40:13,550
No, she'll turn up.

785
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:16,816
She always does.

786
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,983
[cassette tape clacking]

787
00:40:29,783 --> 00:40:31,883
[quiet music]

788
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:42,581
How come I don't see any
pictures of you in here?

789
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,050
Shit I just realized I don't
even know your last name.

790
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:46,283
- Dombrosky.
- Dombrosky.

791
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:52,148
[gasps] Holy shit!

792
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,581
Is this your prom photo?

793
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,048
You must have been
the bell of the ball.

794
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:56,381
- Really so beautiful.
- All right give me that.

795
00:40:56,383 --> 00:40:57,283
No, no, no.

796
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:01,348
All right look you philistine

797
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,114
I was in the
Shakespeare theater club

798
00:41:03,116 --> 00:41:05,481
and we were traditionalists

799
00:41:05,483 --> 00:41:07,881
so we did it like he
did back in his days.

800
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,381
So all the parts by women

801
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,550
were played by men.

802
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,414
Nerd alert!

803
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:16,048
Oh my god, did you
have to make out

804
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,914
with this guy on stage?

805
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,248
You did didn't you?

806
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,414
No, there was no
making out, homophobe.

807
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:21,714
It was "Twelfth Night."

808
00:41:21,716 --> 00:41:24,350
I was Viola and that's my
twin brother Sebastian.

809
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,914
And just so you know Viola
spends most of the time

810
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:29,281
in disguise as a man.

811
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:31,283
So really was just
playing a man.

812
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,514
What are you doing?

813
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:38,483
Just looking up "Twelfth
Night," on Wikipedia.

814
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:41,648
- Why?
- Just checking something.

815
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,183
What?

816
00:41:43,783 --> 00:41:46,581
Ha, I knew it.

817
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:49,181
"The play ends in a
declaration of marriage

818
00:41:49,183 --> 00:41:52,348
"between Duke Orsino and Viola."

819
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,050
You totally made out
with a dude on stage.

820
00:41:55,716 --> 00:41:57,781
It was a quick kiss.

821
00:41:57,783 --> 00:41:59,114
I'll have you know
the school paper

822
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,981
gave us a glowing review.

823
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:02,981
Glowing, it was
four stars in fact.

824
00:42:02,983 --> 00:42:04,681
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

825
00:42:04,683 --> 00:42:07,381
And how much of that
for you frenching a dude?

826
00:42:07,383 --> 00:42:09,214
Bet it was hot.

827
00:42:09,216 --> 00:42:10,350
- Wouldn't you like to know.
- Maybe.

828
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:15,416
What's the matter?

829
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,448
I just realized
you're the first girl

830
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:19,883
I've ever had in here.

831
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:22,481
Get out, I'm the first girl

832
00:42:22,483 --> 00:42:23,050
you've had in your room?

833
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:24,950
Yeah.

834
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:27,116
Liar.

835
00:42:29,483 --> 00:42:31,050
Guess I never wanted to bring
a girl around this madness.

836
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:32,550
My mom anyway.

837
00:42:36,183 --> 00:42:37,050
Man she really
fucked you up huh?

838
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:40,816
I guess so.

839
00:42:45,216 --> 00:42:46,250
Is that why you
tried to kill yourself?

840
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,348
What?

841
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:49,916
You have...

842
00:42:53,716 --> 00:42:54,850
- I don't,
- It's okay.

843
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,316
This is a judgment free zone.

844
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,116
So why'd yo do it?

845
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,250
I don't know.

846
00:43:07,616 --> 00:43:09,981
You don't why you
tried to kill yourself?

847
00:43:09,983 --> 00:43:10,450
It's complicated.

848
00:43:12,016 --> 00:43:12,550
Are you depressed?

849
00:43:14,016 --> 00:43:14,383
Not exactly.

850
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,981
A girl, it's always a girl.

851
00:43:17,983 --> 00:43:20,481
- It wasn't a girl.
- A guy?

852
00:43:20,483 --> 00:43:21,416
No, nothing like that.

853
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,150
Well why?

854
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,116
You're nosy.

855
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:28,350
Yeah, so?

856
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:33,783
I'm not happy.

857
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:36,116
And?

858
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:38,316
And that's it.

859
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:40,416
You're not happy?

860
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:42,850
Not really no.

861
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,283
Well who the fuck is,
George Clooney maybe?

862
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,948
That's no reason to
cash in your chips.

863
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,114
[Casey] No it's
more than that.

864
00:43:52,116 --> 00:43:53,781
I don't even know you, why
am I telling you all this?

865
00:43:53,783 --> 00:43:54,981
Spit it out.

866
00:43:54,983 --> 00:43:55,981
[Casey] You're really pushy.

867
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:56,783
Stalling.

868
00:44:01,983 --> 00:44:03,016
I'm incapable of
experiencing joy.

869
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:08,248
Those things that
make people happy,

870
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,083
sex, money, drugs, career,

871
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:12,883
I feel nothing.

872
00:44:15,383 --> 00:44:16,850
And after a lifetime
of feeling vacant

873
00:44:18,716 --> 00:44:19,816
and numb I just,

874
00:44:21,783 --> 00:44:22,416
I just couldn't do it anymore.

875
00:44:25,116 --> 00:44:26,981
Add that to the fact that I get

876
00:44:26,983 --> 00:44:28,881
a front-row seat at my
own future psychosis

877
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:29,950
every time I see my mother,

878
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:32,550
I just can't.

879
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:38,216
I didn't think anyone
would miss me so.

880
00:44:39,983 --> 00:44:40,516
I would have missed you.

881
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:45,248
[Casey] Thank you, but you
didn't know me three days ago.

882
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,083
Still, I know I would have.

883
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:49,283
Thanks I guess.

884
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:54,448
You probably think
I'm a head case.

885
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:54,883
No I don't.

886
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:57,316
Look I get it, I do.

887
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:01,150
Life is hard and

888
00:45:03,716 --> 00:45:05,116
things are never what you
think they're going to be.

889
00:45:08,183 --> 00:45:09,850
I'd be lying if I said I
hadn't thought about it myself.

890
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:12,550
What stopped you?

891
00:45:16,516 --> 00:45:17,783
My daughter, Jules.

892
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,048
She needs me.

893
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,016
She's really messed
up right now.

894
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:26,150
Messed up how?

895
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,614
She's just more sensitive
than other kids her age.

896
00:45:32,616 --> 00:45:34,314
She fixates on things.

897
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:34,916
She's a worrier.

898
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:39,114
But it pisses me off
that she has to grow up

899
00:45:39,116 --> 00:45:41,581
in this Fox News,
24-hour news cycle,

900
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:42,648
scare the shit out of everyone

901
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,050
on an hourly basis world.

902
00:45:45,616 --> 00:45:47,548
Sorry am I rambling?

903
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,381
No, I asked.

00:45:50,383 --> 00:45:52,781
[jaunty carousel music]

905
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,081
[Jess] When I
was a little girl

906
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:57,081
my dad would take me to
this park in our town

907
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:58,781
and there was this carousel,

908
00:45:58,783 --> 00:45:59,848
you know with brightly
painted horses,

909
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,114
and organ music.

910
00:46:02,116 --> 00:46:05,148
And you could ride
it for 25 cents.

911
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:07,081
So no matter how little
money your folks made

912
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:08,148
they could always
afford to take you

913
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,714
to ride the merry-go-round.

914
00:46:09,716 --> 00:46:11,548
[serious music]

915
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:12,116
Sounds idyllic.

916
00:46:14,616 --> 00:46:16,448
It was, it was a big, big part

917
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,114
of my childhood.

918
00:46:18,116 --> 00:46:18,950
And then they tore it down.

919
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,181
- Why?
- The economy

920
00:46:23,183 --> 00:46:24,681
went into the shitter.

921
00:46:24,683 --> 00:46:25,681
It was a two-factory town

922
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:26,914
and after the last one shut down

923
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:27,816
everything went to hell.

924
00:46:29,783 --> 00:46:30,516
The town's money dried up.

925
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:34,081
They closed the
park and hauled off

926
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,116
that carousel piece by piece.

927
00:46:38,716 --> 00:46:40,116
And it was like they were
hauling away my childhood.

928
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:43,883
Like the world lost
all of its innocence.

929
00:46:45,983 --> 00:46:46,850
Now I really
wanna kill myself.

930
00:46:48,383 --> 00:46:51,081
Shut up. [giggles]

931
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:51,816
Shit what time is it?

932
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,781
It's almost three.

933
00:46:54,783 --> 00:46:56,748
I gotta go.

934
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,248
I told Randy I would
pick up a shift.

935
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,648
We can go.

936
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,381
Fuck, I'm not gonna have time

937
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:03,781
to pick up Jules and then
get to the diner on time!

938
00:47:03,783 --> 00:47:04,516
I can pick her up if you want.

939
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,681
I couldn't.

940
00:47:07,683 --> 00:47:08,016
It's no biggie.

941
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,681
Are you sure, she's
kind of a handful.

942
00:47:12,683 --> 00:47:13,216
How bad can she be?

943
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:23,116
- Jules?
- Yeah?

944
00:47:26,316 --> 00:47:28,014
Who are you?

945
00:47:28,016 --> 00:47:29,214
I'm Casey, I live
in your building.

946
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:30,050
I'm a friend of you mom's.

947
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:33,781
Okay, well where is my mom?

948
00:47:33,783 --> 00:47:35,850
She's at work.

949
00:47:37,883 --> 00:47:40,548
- Yah-huh.
- No, she got fired

950
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,150
- yesterday.
- No, she had to work today.

951
00:47:43,816 --> 00:47:45,781
Are you going to get in?

952
00:47:45,783 --> 00:47:46,383
Did you kill my mother?

953
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:50,114
Why the fuck would
you ask me that?

954
00:47:50,116 --> 00:47:51,083
'Cause you're driving her car.

955
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:54,381
I don't know what to tell you

956
00:47:54,383 --> 00:47:56,181
other than the fact I
didn't kill your mom.

957
00:47:56,183 --> 00:47:58,048
Frankly I'm a little
hurt you even asked.

958
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:58,816
You gonna get in or not?

959
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,814
Raise your right hand then.

960
00:48:02,816 --> 00:48:03,416
- Why?
- Would you just do it?

961
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:11,181
Do you solemnly swear that
you won't sodomize me?

962
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:12,514
Where'd you even
learn that word, Jesus!

963
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:12,950
"Law and Order."

964
00:48:15,216 --> 00:48:17,848
I swear I won't
sodomize you, Christ!

965
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:18,383
Okay.

966
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:24,981
Wait, is she in the trunk?

967
00:48:24,983 --> 00:48:25,748
Is who in the trunk?

968
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,548
My mother.

969
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,014
No, don't be ridiculous.

970
00:48:29,016 --> 00:48:29,416
Prove it.

971
00:48:31,216 --> 00:48:32,083
- How?
- Open the trunk.

972
00:48:33,983 --> 00:48:34,416
- Seriously?
- Completely.

00:48:37,516 --> 00:48:38,116
You darklin' kid.

There, happy?

975
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:49,950
Yeah.

This is the happiest
place on earth?

Can I just take
your order dude?

Fine, can I have
the number one

985
00:49:43,816 --> 00:49:45,814
with extra pickles
and a large coke?

986
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,314
And whatever she wants.

987

988
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:48,516
you want that?

Hey, hey, space cadet.

990
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,014
What do you want to eat?

991
00:49:54,016 --> 00:49:54,816
Someone in this
room has a gun.

992
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:59,614
What, where, did you
see someone with a gun?

993
00:49:59,616 --> 00:50:01,314
- No.
- Then why

994
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:03,214
do you think they have a gun?

995
00:50:03,216 --> 00:50:04,548
Because it's a numbers game.

996
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:05,881

There are 38 people
in this room,

00:50:11,716 --> 00:50:12,850
so somebody's gotta be packing.

1001
00:50:15,816 --> 00:50:18,414
I'm sorry her imagination's
a little crazy sometimes.

1002
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:21,381
I'm not crazy.

1003
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:24,114
Facts are facts, since
1983 there have been

1004
00:50:24,116 --> 00:50:26,114
78 mass shootings
claiming the lives

1005
00:50:26,116 --> 00:50:30,514
of 547 people and injuring 476.

1006
00:50:30,516 --> 00:50:32,014
Should I be worried?

1007
00:50:32,016 --> 00:50:33,114
No, no, everything's fine.

1008
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:35,081
Look, everything is fine, okay.

1009
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:36,581
Nobody goes into a restaurant

1010
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:39,781
and just shoots people
for no good reason, okay?

1011
00:50:39,783 --> 00:50:41,581
Look the kids' meal has an
inappropriately dressed doll.

1012
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:42,914
Okay that's not true.

1013
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:45,248
Take the 1984 massacre

1014
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,781
in a San Diego McDonald's
by James Huberty.

1015
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:50,148
He shot and killed 21 people

1016
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,214
including five children
before being fatally shot

1017
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,148
by a S.W.A.T. team sniper.

1018
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,214
What's your point?

1019
00:50:55,216 --> 00:50:56,548
One minute those people

1020
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,914
were enjoying their Big Macs

1021
00:50:57,916 --> 00:51:00,481
and the next ka-blamo, dead!

1022
00:51:00,483 --> 00:51:02,050
All of them were dead.

1023
00:51:07,283 --> 00:51:08,481
Just give her a kids meal.

1024
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:10,081
Extra pickles for me.

[cash register beeping]

1026
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:19,348
Can you switch me seats?

1027
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:19,850
Why?

1028
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,483
[Jules] Just because.

1029
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:25,481
You've got to give me
a better reason than that

1030
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:26,281
if you want me to
switch after the stunt

1031
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:27,848
you just pulled.

1032
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,483
- Please?
- Nope.

1033
00:51:31,116 --> 00:51:32,116
[Jules] Please?

1034
00:51:33,983 --> 00:51:35,981
Give me a good reason.

1035
00:51:35,983 --> 00:51:37,250
I can't, you'll
think I'm crazy.

1036
00:51:39,116 --> 00:51:40,814
I got news for you kid

1037
00:51:40,816 --> 00:51:42,314
I all ready think you're nuts.

1038
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:42,850
Fine.

1039
00:51:44,983 --> 00:51:46,248
Eat your food.

1040
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,114
[Jules] No.
[Casey scoffs]

1041
00:51:47,116 --> 00:51:47,516
Fine see if I care.

1042
00:51:49,516 --> 00:51:52,481
I'll tell my mom you
made me starve to death.

1043
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:53,281
I'll tell your mom that
you're a mental patient

1044
00:51:53,283 --> 00:51:54,748
and almost made that
poor girl at the counter

1045
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,881
piss her pants.

1046
00:51:55,883 --> 00:51:58,048
I'm not a mental patient.

1047
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,581
Studies show that the
number of homicides

1048
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,248
at fast food restaurants

1049
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,748
is more than double
that of sit-down places.

1050
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,181
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.

1051
00:52:06,183 --> 00:52:07,781
Why do you think
that is smarty pants?

1052
00:52:07,783 --> 00:52:09,681
Fast food restaurants
are easy targets

1053
00:52:09,683 --> 00:52:12,448
for robbery because they
carry a lot of cash on hand.

1054
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,048
Plus they're usually
near major highways

1055
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:14,850
making for an easy getaway.

1056
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,348
Where do you get this stuff?

1057
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:18,550
The internet.

1058
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:21,948
Okay why don't
you talk to your mom

1059
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,148
about monitoring your
internet activity?

1060
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,248
Shouldn't you be worrying
like which Kardashians

1061
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,814
dating which NBA player
or something like that?

1062
00:52:27,816 --> 00:52:29,281
Ew, fuck that!

1063
00:52:29,283 --> 00:52:33,014
Hey, hey, language, Jesus.

1064
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:34,348
[Jules] I just don't
care about that stuff.

1065
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,481
Well you should.

1066
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:36,548
At your age you
shouldn't be thinkin'

1067
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,348
of messed up things like that.

1068
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,348
What else is there
to think about?

1069
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:43,016
I don't know, unicorns
and rainbows and shit.

1070
00:52:44,483 --> 00:52:44,950
I'm not four.

1071
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:48,614
Yeah but you're not 40, okay?

1072
00:52:48,616 --> 00:52:49,714
So you shouldn't be
thinkin' about that stuff.

1073
00:52:49,716 --> 00:52:50,948
Trust me, you've got enough time

1074
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:53,148
to worry about death
when you're older.

1075
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:55,114
By the way, that Huberty
guy in San Diego?

1076
00:52:55,116 --> 00:52:56,681
It wasn't a robbery.

1077
00:52:56,683 --> 00:52:58,881
He suffered from mental illness.

1078
00:52:58,883 --> 00:53:01,248
How did you know that?

1079
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,114
'Cause I was six
when it happened.

1080
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:02,950
Scared the shit out of me too.

1081
00:53:04,683 --> 00:53:06,981
- Really?
- Yeah.

1082
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,214
Didn't go to McDonald's
for a long time after that.

1083
00:53:09,216 --> 00:53:10,050
So then what did you do?

1084
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,114
Nothing, I just
kept on being a kid

1085
00:53:14,116 --> 00:53:15,048
and eventually I got over it.

1086
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,781
And it's what you should do.

1087
00:53:16,783 --> 00:53:18,481
Just be a kid and stop fixating

1088
00:53:18,483 --> 00:53:20,514
on all that dark stuff.

1089
00:53:20,516 --> 00:53:22,548
But what if I can't?

1090
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:26,448
Well, it's off the
nut house with you.

1091
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:28,581
[Kid] Screw the doctor, I
want a Super Colossal Burger!

1092
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,481
- Good enough.
- Spencer Alexander Lanning

1093
00:53:30,483 --> 00:53:31,914
you watch your mouth.

1094
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:33,514
Now you march over to that table

1095
00:53:33,516 --> 00:53:35,848
and you eat what's
on your tray, now.

1096
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:38,148
No!
[tray clattering]

1097
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,614
[Jules] [screams]
What's happening?

1098
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:40,414
[Casey] Jules, Jules.

1099
00:53:40,416 --> 00:53:42,483
[Jules screams]

1100
00:53:44,716 --> 00:53:45,881
[Casey] Calm down, it's okay.

1101
00:53:45,883 --> 00:53:47,614
It's okay, you're okay.

1102
00:53:47,616 --> 00:53:50,181
[Jules screams]
Hey!

1103
00:53:50,183 --> 00:53:51,548
Everything's okay, all right?

1104
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:51,950
You're fine.

1105
00:53:53,883 --> 00:53:56,681
Come on, it's okay.

1106
00:53:56,683 --> 00:53:58,050
You're okay, everything is fine.

1107
00:54:01,716 --> 00:54:03,614
[Jules sobs]

1108
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:05,350
All right, Jesus Christ.

1109
00:54:07,183 --> 00:54:08,448
You scared the shit out of me.

1110
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,714
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1111
00:54:10,716 --> 00:54:12,250
Let's get you home, come on.

1112
00:54:14,283 --> 00:54:16,848
It's okay, nothing to see here.

1113
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,183
We're fine, it's
all good, thank you.

1114
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:19,983
Holy shit.

1115
00:54:28,883 --> 00:54:29,848
[Announcer] In those mistakes

1116
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:30,814
it cost them the arms race

1117
00:54:30,816 --> 00:54:33,414
destroyed all hope of victory.

1118
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:35,114
Germany's cities are in,

1119
00:54:35,116 --> 00:54:36,050
[Casey] How long's
she been like this?

1120
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:37,983
A couple years.

1121
00:54:40,516 --> 00:54:42,383
Ever since Sandy Hook she's
been preparing herself.

1122
00:54:43,783 --> 00:54:45,648
For what?

1123
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:49,981
The inevitable, or at least
what she thinks that is.

1124
00:54:49,983 --> 00:54:52,014
Like everyone else she
watched it unfold on TV

1125
00:54:52,016 --> 00:54:54,114
and ever since
she's been convinced

1126
00:54:54,116 --> 00:54:56,848
it's only a matter of time
before it happens to her.

1127
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,914
She's had it under
control lately,

1128
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:01,114
relatively speaking.

1129
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:02,048
Yeah you didn't see
her in the restaurant.

1130
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:02,850
I almost had a heart attack.

1131
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:04,950
Oh I've seen it.

1132
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:08,314
The doctor says she has symptoms

1133
00:55:08,316 --> 00:55:09,250
like post traumatic
stress disorder.

1134
00:55:11,383 --> 00:55:13,248
Like the guys coming
back from combat?

1135
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:16,514
Pretty much, it
started with nightmares

1136
00:55:16,516 --> 00:55:17,914
and then she couldn't
leave the house for a week.

1137
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:19,450
And her obsession with
guns and legislation.

1138
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:24,414
Can you imagine an 11 year-old

1139
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:26,381
who should be having slumber
parties with her friends

1140
00:55:26,383 --> 00:55:27,781
spends her free time
looking at websites

1141
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:30,148
about mass murder and gun laws.

1142
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,150
Does she still go to therapy?

1143
00:55:33,716 --> 00:55:34,981
I took her to
a couple sessions

1144
00:55:34,983 --> 00:55:37,781
but I don't have
health insurance

1145
00:55:37,783 --> 00:55:38,450
working at the diner.

1146
00:55:40,283 --> 00:55:41,050
So we just can't afford it.

1147
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,581
[phone ringing]

1148
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:45,283
Oh excuse me.

1149
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:53,581
Missy, now I have
the change my locks

1150
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:54,050
and my phone number.

1151
00:55:55,783 --> 00:55:56,581
Wait, wait, wait,

1152
00:55:56,583 --> 00:55:57,250
wait, slow down.

1153
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:01,581
What?
[chatter on the phone]

1154
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:02,016
- Shit!
- What?

1155
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:08,281
They found my mom.

1156
00:56:08,283 --> 00:56:12,250
[machines beeping]
[indistinct chatter]

1157
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:14,648
Missy where is she?

1158
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:16,148
Hello to you too.

1159
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:16,681
Come on, I really
don't have time

1160
00:56:16,683 --> 00:56:17,914
for your shit right now.

1161
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:18,848
Just tell me exactly
what happened.

1162
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:19,948
I don't know.

1163
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,214
They won't let me see her.

1164
00:56:21,216 --> 00:56:22,748
They have her in
a room somewhere.

1165
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,314
[Casey] Did you talk to her?

1166
00:56:24,316 --> 00:56:26,114
What am I speaking Spanish?

1167
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,581
They won't let me see her.

1168
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:30,181
So no I haven't spoken to her.

1169
00:56:30,183 --> 00:56:31,881
- Fuck!
- We'll hang back

1170
00:56:31,883 --> 00:56:32,881
just do what you gotta do.

1171
00:56:32,883 --> 00:56:34,848
Thanks, excuse me.

1172
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,581
I need to see my mom
Dorthy Dombrosky.

1173
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,648
- Are you the son?
- Yeah.

1174
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:39,014
You have my mom in here,
locked away somewhere?

1175
00:56:39,016 --> 00:56:39,981
Yeah, well we had to.

1176
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:41,048
The bitch is crazy.

1177
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:42,614
Who you callin' bitch, bitch?

1178
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:44,281
Missy I'll handle this.

1179
00:56:44,283 --> 00:56:46,348
- Better watch it lady.
- Missy!

1180
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:47,381
For the love of god will
you shut the fuck up

1181
00:56:47,383 --> 00:56:49,914
and go sit down, please?

1182
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:51,214
Just do what you do best

1183
00:56:51,216 --> 00:56:52,450
- and sit this one out.
- Fine.

1184
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,350
- But I'll be right over there.
- Great!

1185
00:56:58,016 --> 00:57:00,148
Look I'm sorry.

1186
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,948
Obviously the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

1187
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:04,014
Tell me exactly what she did.

1188
00:57:04,016 --> 00:57:06,181
Hi Mr. Dombrosky,
I'm Rachel Calahan

1189
00:57:06,183 --> 00:57:08,081
with adult protective services.

1190
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:09,981
And I was on call
when the incident

1191
00:57:09,983 --> 00:57:11,281
- happened.
- Okay.

1192
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:12,348
What incident, please
will you just stop

1193
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:13,414
with the ambiguity

1194
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:15,048
and tell me exactly
what happened?

1195
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,914
Your crazy ass mother
sucker punched me.

1196
00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:19,048
Thank you Rita.

1197
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,981
I believe I can
handle it from here.

1198
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:24,914
Okay, [speaking
foreign language]

1199
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:26,114
I don't know
what she's saying.

1200
00:57:26,116 --> 00:57:28,081
Mr. Dombrosky I understand

1201
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:29,948
your concern about your mother.

1202
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,048
And she's okay.

1203
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,881
I just need you to know

1204
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:34,514
this situation is very serious.

1205
00:57:34,516 --> 00:57:36,148
We had to sedate her.

1206
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:36,483
Okay?

1207
00:57:38,983 --> 00:57:40,450
You don't seem very surprised.

1208
00:57:42,183 --> 00:57:44,281
It's par for the course.

1209
00:57:44,283 --> 00:57:46,948
[machine beeping]
[serious music]

1210
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,814
[Rachel] Nurse
Espinoza found your mom

1211
00:57:48,816 --> 00:57:50,948
in the room of oncology patient

1212
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,148
by the name of Jeff Timlin.

1213
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,048
Do you know who that is?

1214
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,714
- No.
- Could he be

1215
00:57:56,716 --> 00:57:58,614
and acquaintance of your mom's?

1216
00:57:58,616 --> 00:57:59,381
I don't think so.

1217
00:57:59,383 --> 00:58:00,614
I don't know.

1218
00:58:00,616 --> 00:58:01,514
Well what does that have
to do with anything?

1219
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:03,148
[Rachel] Well as I was saying.

1220
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,048
Ms. Espinoza
confronted your mother

1221
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,981
in Mr. Timlin's room
while she was attempting

1222
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:10,214
to administer a lethal
dose of morphine

1223
00:58:10,216 --> 00:58:11,914
into the patient's IV.
[machine beeping]

1224
00:58:11,916 --> 00:58:15,281
- Shit.
- She's very disoriented.

1225
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,383
She was rambling about
someone named Jerry?

1226
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,381
My father's name was Jerry.

1227
00:58:21,383 --> 00:58:22,914
Where is he?

1228
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,881
- He passed away.
- I'm sorry.

1229
00:58:24,883 --> 00:58:25,916
It's fine, it's
a long time ago.

1230
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:29,414
Mr. Dombrosky does your mother

1231
00:58:29,416 --> 00:58:30,516
have a history of
mental illness?

1232
00:58:32,416 --> 00:58:33,948
Does she?

1233
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:35,248
Yeah, she's the poster child

1234
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,948
for fucking mental illness.

1235
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:39,681
What was her diagnosis?

1236
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:40,981
- She bipolar.
- Is she under

1237
00:58:40,983 --> 00:58:42,448
a doctor's care?

1238
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,648
She was obviously,

1239
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:46,048
but now, look I don't know.

1240
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,250
We've drifted apart.

1241
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:49,981
Will you just tell
me what happens next?

1242
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,481
Can I take her home?

1243
00:58:51,483 --> 00:58:52,681
I'm afraid that
will not be possible.

1244
00:58:52,683 --> 00:58:54,314
Why not?

1245
00:58:54,316 --> 00:58:56,714
Mr. Dombrosky your mother
tried to kill a patient

1246
00:58:56,716 --> 00:58:58,114
in this hospital.

1247
00:58:58,116 --> 00:59:00,048
And she assaulted
a staff member.

1248
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,814
She's harmless.

1249
00:59:01,816 --> 00:59:02,781
All right, she's bat shit crazy

1250
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,714
but she's harmless.

1251
00:59:03,716 --> 00:59:05,981
Be that as it may

1252
00:59:05,983 --> 00:59:08,581
you just need to know this
is a serious situation.

1253
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:11,048
There's a chance that
she may be charged

1254
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:11,983
and you might want
to get a lawyer.

1255
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:17,114
[Man] The situation
is very serious.

1256
00:59:17,116 --> 00:59:19,914
If convicted your mother
could go away for long time.

1257
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:22,281
Convicted?

1258
00:59:22,283 --> 00:59:25,248
I told you she didn't
try to kill anyone.

1259
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,348
That's not the way
it looks on our end.

1260
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:29,614
Now look there's still
a lot of moving parts.

1261
00:59:29,616 --> 00:59:32,114
But once I turn this report
over to the prosecutor

1262
00:59:32,116 --> 00:59:33,948
it's very likely your
mother would be charged

1263
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:34,450
with attempted murder.

1264
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:38,481
You're going to
send her to prison?

1265
00:59:38,483 --> 00:59:40,181
Not necessarily.

1266
00:59:40,183 --> 00:59:42,714
Your mom appears to have a case

1267
00:59:42,716 --> 00:59:45,148
for what's known as
diminished mental capacity.

1268
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:46,148
And basically what that is

1269
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,181
is she lacks the ability

1270
00:59:48,183 --> 00:59:50,148
to differentiate
between right and wrong.

1271
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:53,548
- Okay.
- So if the court

1272
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:56,248
finds that she lacks
criminal responsibility

1273
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,881
then she could possibly
be civilly committed

1274
00:59:59,883 --> 01:00:00,816
instead of going to prison.

1275
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:05,048
- A hospital?
- A state psychiatric

1276
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:06,748
- facility.
- Fine.

1277
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:09,714
However it could take awhile

1278
01:00:09,716 --> 01:00:12,914
to process everything and
your mom would not be getting

1279
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:14,848
the treatment that
needs in the interim.

1280
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,648
My department gets involved

1281
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:19,881
when someone with
diminished mental capacity

1282
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:21,581
becomes a threat to themselves

1283
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:23,948
or to those around them

1284
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:26,314
and I believe in this case

1285
01:00:26,316 --> 01:00:28,814
your mom falls
into that category.

1286
01:00:28,816 --> 01:00:31,081
[scoffs] You think?

1287
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:33,881
What I think is we may be able

1288
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:37,648
to have your mom
involuntarily committed now

1289
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:39,116
instead of going through
the criminal process.

1290
01:00:40,883 --> 01:00:43,214
- Meaning?
- I think

1291
01:00:43,216 --> 01:00:45,281
that your mom requires
residential treatment

1292
01:00:45,283 --> 01:00:47,481
for an extended period of time

1293
01:00:47,483 --> 01:00:49,914
because there is a
substantial likelihood

1294
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:52,081
that she's gonna hurt herself

1295
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:54,316
or someone else if she's
not committed immediately.

1296
01:00:57,216 --> 01:00:58,283
Okay, but how does that
keep her out of jail?

1297
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,881
If the judge commits her prior

1298
01:01:01,883 --> 01:01:03,248
to my report being submitted

1299
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,314
the prosecution will wait

1300
01:01:05,316 --> 01:01:07,248
to charge her until
they determine

1301
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,348
what the diagnosis and
treatment plan are.

1302
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:09,981
If that's going to
keep her outta jail

1303
01:01:09,983 --> 01:01:11,348
then let's do it.

1304
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:13,414
[Rachel] Well
it's not the simple.

1305
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:14,748
Of course it isn't.

1306
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,181
Your mom receives
SSI disability

1307
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,414
and there are costs associated

1308
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:20,483
with having someone
civilly committed,

1309
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:24,114
substantial costs.

1310
01:01:24,116 --> 01:01:26,381
Okay?

1311
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:29,614
However if your mom does go
through the criminal process

1312
01:01:29,616 --> 01:01:32,114
and she is found lacking
criminal responsibility

1313
01:01:32,116 --> 01:01:34,214
then all of her treatment

1314
01:01:34,216 --> 01:01:37,114
and commitment would be
covered by the state.

1315
01:01:37,116 --> 01:01:37,814
Let me get this straight,

1316
01:01:37,816 --> 01:01:40,314
just so I'm clear.

1317
01:01:40,316 --> 01:01:42,914
If I pay a substantial
amount of money

1318
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:43,681
then my mom gets the help

1319
01:01:43,683 --> 01:01:44,050
she needs now.

1320
01:01:45,983 --> 01:01:49,214
If I don't, she
rots in a jail cell

1321
01:01:49,216 --> 01:01:51,114
until a judge decides
she needs help?

1322
01:01:51,116 --> 01:01:51,483
In a nut shell.

1323
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,848
That's fucked!

1324
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:56,550
The system isn't perfect.

1325
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:01,816
Can I see her?

1326
01:02:07,783 --> 01:02:10,014
Hey, I'm so sorry.

1327
01:02:10,016 --> 01:02:11,283
It's okay, how's your mom?

1328
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:13,116
It's not good.

1329
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:15,848
Would you excuse
me for one minute

1330
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:16,781
I have one more
thing to take care of

1331
01:02:16,783 --> 01:02:18,181
and I swear we can go.

1332
01:02:18,183 --> 01:02:19,450
- Do what you gotta do.
- Okay.

1333
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:28,181
Oh hey little bro.

1334
01:02:28,183 --> 01:02:30,148
- Hey.
- This is Antonio.

1335
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,448
Nice to meet you.

1336
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:32,648
He's a paramedic.

1337
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,281
I see that.

1338
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,648
Antonio is it?

1339
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:36,448
Could you give me a moment

1340
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:36,850
alone with my sister?

1341
01:02:38,283 --> 01:02:39,816
Sure, I gotta run anyway.

1342
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,981
I have your number.

1343
01:02:42,983 --> 01:02:44,548
I'll call you sometime.

1344
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:44,950
[Missy] You better.

1345
01:02:48,816 --> 01:02:49,816
- Hey.
- What's up?

1346
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,914
What's up?

1347
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:54,448
How the fuck can you be
so casual about this?

1348
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:56,748
You know they might send
mom to jail forever?

1349
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:59,114
Does that even
resonate with you?

1350
01:02:59,116 --> 01:03:01,714
Relax, she's always
getting into little SNAFUs.

1351
01:03:01,716 --> 01:03:03,248
Everything's gonna be fine.

1352
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,516
SNAFU, is that what you
call attempted murder?

1353
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,414
Listen Missy, here's the deal,

1354
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:11,548
you want half of
Aunt Edna's money?

1355
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,248
- You got it.
- Really?

1356
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,814
Yeah, but with it
comes some strings.

1357
01:03:15,816 --> 01:03:17,648
What kind of strings?

1358
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:19,881
Great big fucking strings.

1359
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:22,214
I'm listening.

1360
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:23,483
You get the money,
but then I'm out.

1361
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:26,381
What does that
mean, "you're out?"

1362
01:03:26,383 --> 01:03:28,248
It means I'm done.

1363
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,581
I'm done, you get the money

1364
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:31,214
but with it comes
the responsibility.

1365
01:03:31,216 --> 01:03:32,814
All of it.

1366
01:03:32,816 --> 01:03:34,848
You take care of
mom from now on.

1367
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:36,948
I can't do it.

1368
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:37,916
Okay, I have too
many of my own issues

1369
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:41,481
and I just can't.

1370
01:03:41,483 --> 01:03:43,414
So can you do that?

1371
01:03:43,416 --> 01:03:44,783
Can you do the right thing
for once in your life?

1372
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:48,881
I don't know Casey.

1373
01:03:48,883 --> 01:03:49,648
Don't give me that shit.

1374
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:50,514
You want the money?

1375
01:03:50,516 --> 01:03:51,781
This is how you get it.

1376
01:03:51,783 --> 01:03:53,781
I don't know if I can.

1377
01:03:53,783 --> 01:03:54,283
I'm not like you.

1378
01:03:55,983 --> 01:03:58,550
Casey you're strong, I'm weak.

1379
01:04:00,883 --> 01:04:02,048
You'll figure it out.

1380
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:02,416
You always do.

This is the deal.

1382

Yeah.

Did you not see the sign?

1426
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,281
- What sign?
- The exit sign back there

1427
01:06:52,283 --> 01:06:53,914
didn't you see what it said?

1428
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:55,548
No Jules I didn't
what did it say?

1429
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:57,114
We have to go back there.

1430
01:06:57,116 --> 01:06:58,814
I don't understand, why?

1431
01:06:58,816 --> 01:07:00,250
Please?

1432
01:07:09,716 --> 01:07:10,883
It happened here.

1433
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:13,981
What happened?

1434
01:07:13,983 --> 01:07:16,648
October 22nd, 2011.

1435
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:18,914
Andrew Langston, aged
20, shot and killed

1436
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:21,414
six people and himself

1437
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,914
at Scared Heart
Elementary School.

1438
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:25,214
That's in Marinette.

1439
01:07:25,216 --> 01:07:28,981
- Oh shit.
- First he killed his mother

1440
01:07:28,983 --> 01:07:31,048
and little brother before
driving to the school

1441
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:34,714
with four guns, a Bushmaster
223 caliber rifle,

1442
01:07:34,716 --> 01:07:37,081
a Glock 10 millimeter hand gun,

1443
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:39,781
a Sig Sauer nine
millimeter hand gun

1444
01:07:39,783 --> 01:07:43,014
and an Izhmash 12 gage shotgun.

1445
01:07:43,016 --> 01:07:45,014
He killed four
third grade children

1446
01:07:45,016 --> 01:07:46,548
and one teacher.

1447
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:47,748
That's messed up.

1448
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:48,781
Four others were injured

1449
01:07:48,783 --> 01:07:50,681
including the principal,

1450
01:07:50,683 --> 01:07:52,381
the guidance councilor

1451
01:07:52,383 --> 01:07:54,914
and nine year-old fourth
grader Emily Richmond.

1452
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:57,214
According to a corner's report

1453
01:07:57,216 --> 01:08:00,514
all the of the victims were
shot between three and 11 times.

1454
01:08:00,516 --> 01:08:02,148
Where did you get
a corner's report?

1455
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:04,581
The Department of
Public Records website.

1456
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:06,481
They just let kids read
those online for free?

1457
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:07,648
That's messed up.

1458
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:10,048
Of course not, I had
to pay of it first.

1459
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:11,514
With what money?

1460
01:08:11,516 --> 01:08:13,114
You never log out of
your PayPal account.

1461
01:08:13,116 --> 01:08:14,614
Why would you do that?

1462
01:08:14,616 --> 01:08:17,948
To learn, I don't want
to be another statistic.

1463
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:19,781
This is really messed up.

1464
01:08:19,783 --> 01:08:21,548
- Jules,
- We have to go there.

1465
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:22,581
I have to see her.

1466
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:24,081
- See who?
- Emily.

1467
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:26,348
The one who survived.

1468
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:27,814
[Jess] Jules we
can't just go there.

1469
01:08:27,816 --> 01:08:28,614
- Why not?
- We don't even know

1470
01:08:28,616 --> 01:08:30,048
where she lives.

1471
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:31,714
But I need to see her

1472
01:08:31,716 --> 01:08:33,214
- and tell her,
- Tell her what?

1473
01:08:33,216 --> 01:08:34,881
Jules this has got to stop.

1474
01:08:34,883 --> 01:08:36,048
You are fixated on this stuff.

1475
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,748
It's not healthy.

1476
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:38,647
- Mom.
- No that's the end of it.

1477
01:08:38,649 --> 01:08:39,614
Discussion over.

1478
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:41,614
That's bullshit.

1479
01:08:41,616 --> 01:08:42,814
Watch your mouth.

1480
01:08:42,816 --> 01:08:46,581
Okay, I could take her.

1481
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:48,881
Casey we can't.

1482
01:08:48,883 --> 01:08:49,850
It obviously means
a lot to her, right?

1483
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:52,516
This is a bad idea.

1484
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:54,883
Yeah, maybe.

1485
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,083
[birds chirping]

1486
01:09:03,016 --> 01:09:03,550
I feel weird about this.

1487
01:09:05,149 --> 01:09:06,614
I'm sure it's fine.

1488
01:09:06,616 --> 01:09:07,948
We'll knock, they'll answer

1489
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:09,281
and we'll ask,
"Hey by any chance

1490
01:09:09,283 --> 01:09:10,149
"was your daughter
shot by a maniac?"

1491
01:09:12,683 --> 01:09:13,414
Jules we don't have to do this

1492
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:14,448
we can just drive away.

1493
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,316
No, I want to.

1494
01:09:18,649 --> 01:09:20,250
She wants to, let's do it.

1495
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:33,216
It's all you kid.

1496
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:38,483
[sighs] Okay.

1497
01:09:41,016 --> 01:09:43,383
[doorbell ringing]

1498
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:54,481
Hello?

1499
01:09:54,483 --> 01:09:57,148
Hi, I'm Jessica and
this my daughter Julie.

1500
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:57,950
And this is my friend Casey.

1501
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:02,081
Jules, say hello.

1502
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:05,781
- Hi.
- Hello.

1503
01:10:05,783 --> 01:10:06,116
How can I help you?

1504
01:10:11,983 --> 01:10:13,014
I know this is
going to sound weird,

1505
01:10:13,016 --> 01:10:14,681
but my daughter has something

1506
01:10:14,683 --> 01:10:16,550
she'd like to ask you and
you can totally say "no."

1507
01:10:18,716 --> 01:10:19,250
Okay.

1508
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:24,083
It was school picture day.

1509
01:10:26,383 --> 01:10:28,981
We fought over how she
was going to wear her hair

1510
01:10:28,983 --> 01:10:30,314
Emily wanted to wear
it in a pony tail.

1511
01:10:30,316 --> 01:10:32,814
I wanted her to wear it down.

1512
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:33,950
She has such pretty hair.

1513
01:10:36,183 --> 01:10:37,748
But she started
playing volleyball

1514
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,514
and all the girls

1515
01:10:39,516 --> 01:10:40,916
were going to wear their
hair up for pictures.

1516
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:45,283
It's so stupid.

1517
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:49,883
Silly things we think
are worth fighting over.

1518
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:52,648
After it was over and,

1519
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:54,881
[serious music]

1520
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:55,516
we were at the hospital

1521
01:10:58,083 --> 01:10:59,250
and we had not idea of
Emily was alive or dead.

1522
01:11:01,816 --> 01:11:03,581
There was a lot on confusion

1523
01:11:03,583 --> 01:11:05,314
because a lot of the
girls had head wounds

1524
01:11:05,316 --> 01:11:07,748
and they couldn't
tell who was who

1525
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:08,450
if it wasn't for the numbers.

1526
01:11:10,283 --> 01:11:11,448
The numbers?

1527
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:12,150
On their uniforms.

1528
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:16,748
- Oh god.
- I was lucky.

1529
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:19,148
I was hit in the back.

1530
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,681
And that's what
caused the paralysis?

1531
01:11:21,683 --> 01:11:23,714
- Yeah.
- A CT scan revealed

1532
01:11:23,716 --> 01:11:25,781
the bullet fragmented,

1533
01:11:25,783 --> 01:11:28,114
fracturing the first
lumbar vertebra

1534
01:11:28,116 --> 01:11:29,481
lodging between the
right vertebral body

1535
01:11:29,483 --> 01:11:34,748
and aorta, I read.

1536
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:35,350
It's kind of what she does.

1537
01:11:39,916 --> 01:11:40,883
We were just about
to have dinner.

1538
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:44,348
You're welcome to stay.

1539
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:46,148
We couldn't we've
already imposed enough.

1540
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:47,316
It's no trouble, really.

1541
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,516
I could eat.

1542
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,181
Emily why don't you
show Julie your room

1543
01:11:54,183 --> 01:11:55,648
while your mother gets
supper on the table?

1544
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:58,548
- Okay.
- By the way

1545
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:59,848
you can call me Jules.

1546
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:00,516
Everyone calls me Jules.

1547
01:12:05,883 --> 01:12:06,981
[Emily] Where do
you go to school?

1548
01:12:06,983 --> 01:12:08,581
I go to Lincoln.

1549
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:10,081
[Emily] Where's that?

1550
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:13,114
Um, a couple hours from here.

1551
01:12:13,116 --> 01:12:15,148
You came all
that way to see me?

1552
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:19,114
Yeah, well also Casey's mom,

1553
01:12:19,116 --> 01:12:20,316
she got arrested for murder.

1554
01:12:22,183 --> 01:12:24,248
Well I guess it
wasn't really murder

1555
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:27,281
but like attempted murder.

1556
01:12:27,283 --> 01:12:29,114
I don't know I didn't
really hear all the details.

1557
01:12:29,116 --> 01:12:30,881
Is he your dad?

1558
01:12:30,883 --> 01:12:31,948
He's my mom's friend.

1559
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:33,581
But I really like him.

1560
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:34,216
He seems nice.

1561
01:12:36,116 --> 01:12:36,550
You know he is.

1562
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:42,148
[crickets chirping]

1563
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,550
- [door creaking]
- Hey.

1564
01:12:53,516 --> 01:12:54,116
Weird day huh?

1565
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,183
That's the
understatement of the year.

1566
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,550
Still I feel at peace.

1567
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:05,550
Like today was important.

1568
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:07,850
For Jules?

1569
01:13:09,783 --> 01:13:10,316
For everyone.

1570
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:15,916
Looks like we
had the same idea.

1571
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:28,550
Connie won't let me
smoke in the house.

1572
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:33,581
I just wanna say thanks

1573
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:35,714
for the dinner and for
letting Jules meet Emily.

1574
01:13:35,716 --> 01:13:36,283
You guys are way too kind.

1575
01:13:38,516 --> 01:13:41,414
Yeah we've inconvenienced
you enough for one lifetime.

1576
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:42,648
So we'll be heading out.

1577
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:46,114
Aw, nonsense, it's too
late to head out now.

1578
01:13:46,116 --> 01:13:47,981
You'll stay the night.

1579
01:13:47,983 --> 01:13:51,014
Oh no we can't, really.

1580
01:13:51,016 --> 01:13:51,383
It's no trouble.

1581
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:56,948
Besides I think it'll
do Emily some good

1582
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:59,581
to have Jules spend the night.

1583
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:01,316
A lot of the kids don't
come around as much anymore.

1584
01:14:03,916 --> 01:14:04,883
It's good that Jules
isn't afraid of her.

1585
01:14:07,883 --> 01:14:08,550
Why would they
be afraid of her.

1586
01:14:10,183 --> 01:14:12,416
Who knows, kids are kids.

1587
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,350
Maybe they think she's fragile.

1588
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,883
Maybe she reminds them of
what they're tryin' to forget.

1589
01:14:23,283 --> 01:14:24,816
Whatever the reason,
I'm glad you came.

1590
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:27,150
We're glad you came.

1591
01:14:30,683 --> 01:14:32,848
Well at least let me
help with the dishes.

1592
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:35,448
I already loaded
up the dishwasher.

1593
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:38,216
So it's settled you'll
head out in the morning.

1594
01:14:40,716 --> 01:14:41,350
You're strong people.

1595
01:14:44,216 --> 01:14:46,081
You're much stronger
than I could be.

1596
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:46,483
You'd be surprised.

1597
01:14:49,116 --> 01:14:49,950
We're no stronger
than anyone else.

1598
01:14:52,116 --> 01:14:54,081
We just decided that
we aren't gonna let

1599
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:55,850
that one moment define
who we were as a family.

1600
01:14:57,950 --> 01:15:00,150
We were gonna be
bigger than the moment.

1601
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:04,116
Do you have kids?

1602
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:06,914
No.

1603
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:07,283
You'll see.

1604
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:11,150
They make you stronger than
you ever thought you could be.

1605
01:15:14,516 --> 01:15:14,816
I believe that.

1606
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:22,714
Hey do you think I
could ask you a question?

1607
01:15:22,716 --> 01:15:23,250
Sure.

1608
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:26,648
That boy,

1609
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:29,250
Andrew, the one that shot you,

1610
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:31,216
you knew him?

1611
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:34,450
Yeah, he used to mow our lawn.

1612
01:15:37,216 --> 01:15:40,950
Did you see him
when he shot you?

1613
01:15:43,516 --> 01:15:45,516
I mean did you see
him pull the trigger?

1614
01:15:47,183 --> 01:15:48,816
No, I was running away.

1615
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:53,250
But I saw him shoot my
friend Katie in the head.

1616
01:15:56,183 --> 01:15:57,516
I'm just so sorry
he did this to you.

1617
01:15:59,783 --> 01:16:01,116
It's okay, I forgive him.

1618
01:16:02,883 --> 01:16:03,316
Really?

1619
01:16:05,516 --> 01:16:06,050
Why?

1620
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:10,081
I guess if that's
the worst thing

1621
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:11,414
that's happened to me,

1622
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:13,514
I'm pretty lucky.

1623
01:16:13,516 --> 01:16:15,348
I can't imagine anything
worse happening to me.

1624
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:17,348
And I survived.

1625
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:17,550
And I met you.

1626
01:16:20,383 --> 01:16:20,916
Yeah.

1627
01:16:23,383 --> 01:16:24,048
Good night.

1628
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:24,483
Good night.

1629
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,183
It's funny about these photos.

1630
01:16:53,883 --> 01:16:55,016
Yeah, how so?

1631
01:16:56,683 --> 01:16:57,050
They're smiling.

1632
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:00,781
They had no idea the shit storm

1633
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:01,316
that was coming their way.

1634
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,614
Bad things happen
to good people.

1635
01:17:05,616 --> 01:17:07,014
That's just it,

1636
01:17:07,016 --> 01:17:07,816
even after all that happened,

1637
01:17:09,716 --> 01:17:10,350
they don't seem any different.

1638
01:17:12,116 --> 01:17:13,948
They still smile.

1639
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:15,448
They still just keep living

1640
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:16,416
like nothing's changed.

1641
01:17:18,816 --> 01:17:20,081
Well what else can they do?

1642
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:20,550
They can get angry.

1643
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:23,383
What?

1644
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:25,983
Nothing.

1645
01:17:28,883 --> 01:17:31,948
There's one bed huh?

1646
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:33,850
Yeah, that seems
to be the situation.

1647
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:39,081
How do you wanna do it?

1648
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:41,248
Sleeping arrangements,

1649
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,714
- I can sleep on the floor or,
- No it's okay.

1650
01:17:43,716 --> 01:17:45,214
We can share the bed.

1651
01:17:45,216 --> 01:17:46,281
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1652
01:17:46,283 --> 01:17:46,450
I don't bite.

1653
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:49,083
Okay.

1654
01:17:57,916 --> 01:18:00,548
Okay, can I just say

1655
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,081
that was pretty amazing.

1656
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:03,814
- What?
- This.

1657
01:18:03,816 --> 01:18:06,381
This entire day.

1658
01:18:06,383 --> 01:18:08,581
Well not the stuff
with your mom.

1659
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:10,150
But everything after
that, with Jules.

1660
01:18:13,116 --> 01:18:14,981
I think this is gonna
be really good for her.

1661
01:18:14,983 --> 01:18:15,416
I hope so.

1662
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:21,050
I just wanna say thank you.

1663
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:26,581
- For what?
- For doing this.

1664
01:18:26,583 --> 01:18:27,916
For making me do this.

1665
01:18:29,916 --> 01:18:30,883
I didn't make you do anything.

1666
01:18:34,016 --> 01:18:35,083
You're a great mom.

1667
01:18:37,483 --> 01:18:38,383
And I know you'd do
anything for Jules.

1668
01:18:41,716 --> 01:18:44,316
Well I couldn't have done
it without you, really.

1669
01:18:47,516 --> 01:18:48,016
Maybe you needed a push

1670
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:51,981
from a crazy person?

1671
01:18:51,983 --> 01:18:54,848
Maybe, not that you're crazy.

1672
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:55,283
But yeah.

1673
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:58,316
Don't mention it.

1674
01:19:18,183 --> 01:19:19,648
Casey?

1675
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:20,150
Hm?

1676
01:19:23,716 --> 01:19:24,316
I like you.

1677
01:19:26,616 --> 01:19:27,950
You're a pretty
cool person yourself.

1678
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:30,050
No, I mean

1679
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:34,116
I really like you.

1680
01:19:37,716 --> 01:19:38,150
Really?

1681
01:19:40,616 --> 01:19:41,914
Do you like, like me, like me?

1682
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:42,516
Be serious.

1683
01:19:49,116 --> 01:19:50,514
I don't know who you are

1684
01:19:50,516 --> 01:19:51,983
or really much about you at all.

1685
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:55,416
But yeah, I like you.

1686
01:19:58,283 --> 01:20:00,648
I think you might know me

1687
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:02,381
better than anybody in
the world right now.

1688
01:20:02,383 --> 01:20:02,550
That's sad.

1689
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:04,550
Why is it sad?

1690
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:08,981
Because I've known
you for four days.

1691
01:20:08,983 --> 01:20:10,248
It was a pretty
eventful four days

1692
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:11,948
don't you think?

1693
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:12,981
What about your family?

1694
01:20:12,983 --> 01:20:13,883
Your mom, they know you?

1695
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:18,016
Maybe when I was a little kid,

1696
01:20:20,283 --> 01:20:21,383
before my dad died, but not now.

1697
01:20:24,350 --> 01:20:24,948
I don't even know
if my mom knows

1698
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:25,483
she has a son now.

1699
01:20:30,216 --> 01:20:33,481
It has to feel like
nobody knows who I am.

1700
01:20:33,483 --> 01:20:34,283
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

1701
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:38,981
Well I feel like
I know who you are.

1702
01:20:38,983 --> 01:20:40,016
I mean on one hand I
don't know you at all

1703
01:20:42,383 --> 01:20:42,850
but in a way

1704
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:46,550
I feel like I've
always known you.

1705
01:20:50,516 --> 01:20:51,383
You're a pretty amazing person.

1706
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:55,850
Really I'm not.

1707
01:20:57,916 --> 01:20:59,648
In the few days I've known you

1708
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:01,714
you've got me my job back,

1709
01:21:01,716 --> 01:21:02,748
Which I got you fired from

1710
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:03,814
to begin with.

1711
01:21:03,816 --> 01:21:04,350
Yeah there was that.

1712
01:21:06,983 --> 01:21:09,814
But still you didn't
have to do what you did.

1713
01:21:09,816 --> 01:21:10,848
But you did it anyway.

1714
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:12,914
Any guy would have done that.

1715
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:14,983
No actually most
guys wouldn't have.

1716
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:18,581
At least not the ones I know.

1717
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:19,216
And you're here now,

1718
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:24,281
sleeping in a complete
stranger's bed

1719
01:21:24,283 --> 01:21:25,881
because you cared about the
feelings of a little girl

1720
01:21:25,883 --> 01:21:26,283
you barely know.

1721
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:28,983
I mean who does that?

1722
01:21:31,316 --> 01:21:31,516
I don't know.

1723
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:36,981
Wait, what are you doing?

1724
01:21:36,983 --> 01:21:39,248
What does it look like?

1725
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:41,748
It looks like you
had an emotional day

1726
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,681
and you're about to do something

1727
01:21:43,683 --> 01:21:44,183
you're going to regret.

1728
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:47,948
I'm a big girl.

1729
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:50,214
I'll decide what
mistakes I make.

1730
01:21:50,216 --> 01:21:51,516
Yeah this seems
like a big one.

1731
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,050
Why don't you like yourself?

1732
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,083
What's there to like?

1733
01:22:02,316 --> 01:22:04,581
I can think of a few things.

1734
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:07,516
Jess, you're like the
coolest chic I ever met.

1735
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:13,548
You're smart and you're funny

1736
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:15,614
and Jules is awesome.

1737
01:22:15,616 --> 01:22:17,883
And you are sexy as hell.

1738
01:22:19,616 --> 01:22:24,848
- But...
- But

1739
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:25,516
but I'm a disaster right now.

1740
01:22:28,683 --> 01:22:31,248
Hi I'm Jessica, have we met?

1741
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:32,281
I was hanging from a rope

1742
01:22:32,283 --> 01:22:32,883
a few days ago.

1743
01:22:36,816 --> 01:22:37,850
Do you get the enormity of that?

1744
01:22:40,683 --> 01:22:42,114
I know but you didn't die.

1745
01:22:42,116 --> 01:22:43,050
- You're alive.
- Am I?

1746
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:45,548
I'm breathing but I
haven't felt alive

1747
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:48,781
since I don't know when.

1748
01:22:48,783 --> 01:22:51,014
So now you get
a second chance.

1749
01:22:51,016 --> 01:22:51,916
A second chance at what?

1750
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:56,581
Life, love, the
pursuit of happiness.

1751
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:59,281
I don't know what
any of that means.

1752
01:22:59,283 --> 01:23:01,114
Just because a fucking
ceiling fan broke

1753
01:23:01,116 --> 01:23:02,481
doesn't meant I magically
changed my mind.

1754
01:23:02,483 --> 01:23:03,781
Nothing has changed.

1755
01:23:03,783 --> 01:23:04,581
It hasn't changed anything.

1756
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:05,748
It changed everything.

1757
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:06,250
How?

1758
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:09,483
You met me, that's
pretty awesome.

1759
01:23:11,816 --> 01:23:12,883
You're rich now,
couldn't say that before.

1760
01:23:15,516 --> 01:23:16,981
That's the beauty of life.

1761
01:23:16,983 --> 01:23:18,914
One minute you're world
can be at its darkest

1762
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:21,381
and then the sun rises

1763
01:23:21,383 --> 01:23:23,116
and you see the world
in a whole new light.

1764
01:23:24,816 --> 01:23:25,416
It's a shitty world.

1765
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:28,681
It's the same shitty world

1766
01:23:28,683 --> 01:23:31,414
where I look at my mother
and I see my future.

1767
01:23:31,416 --> 01:23:32,416
Yeah but now it's a
world with me in it.

1768
01:23:35,283 --> 01:23:36,483
And you said it
yourself, I'm awesome.

1769
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:39,383
Actually I said
Jules was awesome.

1770
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:42,150
I said you were sexy.

1771
01:23:44,516 --> 01:23:44,950
Either way.

1772
01:23:49,683 --> 01:23:50,814
And you don't know for sure

1773
01:23:50,816 --> 01:23:51,350
what the future holds.

1774
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:54,814
Yeah you could end
up like your mom

1775
01:23:54,816 --> 01:23:55,316
or maybe you won't.

1776
01:23:57,683 --> 01:23:59,250
But I think I wanna be
there to find out with you.

1777
01:24:02,183 --> 01:24:04,214
And if that means
being your friend

1778
01:24:04,216 --> 01:24:06,050
or your girlfriend, or whatever.

I know this is hard.

1957
01:34:41,283 --> 01:34:42,848
And I can't say that I blame
you for having feelings

1958
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:44,216
of resentment, even anger.

1959

that you'll need to sign.

Let me just grab those

way lickety split.

to do with my decision.

1973

I told you before that
nothing has changed.

1974
01:35:33,583 --> 01:35:36,881
My mind hasn't changed.

1975

And even though you and
Jules changed my heart,

1976

I'll never be normal.

You need stability.
