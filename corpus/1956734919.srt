What do we call her?

18
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:35,056
Aunt Jean.

19
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:36,926
She looks nicer than Marsha.

00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,728
LIBBY:
She does.

21
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,962
Hey.

22
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:41,931
- Hi Libby.
- Hi.

23
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,232
Thank you so much for having us.

24
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,936
Oh, you're always welcome here.

25
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,638
Thanks.

26
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,540
- Oh.
- Who are these two beauties?

27
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:53,174
Well, um, this little one
is Tank

28
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:55,678
and this big one is Abby.

29
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,514
Hello, nice to meet you both.

30
00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:00,716
Are those wands you have there?

31
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,552
Why don't you go over there
and try to turn that goat

32
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:04,353
into a goose?

33
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:06,221
- Might work.
- It's okay.

34
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,356
Go ahead.

35
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:09,926
Just be careful.

36
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:11,394
Goats don't bite, do they?

37
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:12,695
Course they do, they're goats.

38
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:13,996
(Both laugh)

39
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:15,798
Watch your fingers!

(Goat bleating)

41
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,802
It's so soft.

42
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:21,472
Wow.

43
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:25,374
JEAN: That's one of
my favourite pieces.

44
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:27,075
Frank always thought of himself
as an artist

45
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,111
and I guess I did, too.

46
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:31,547
He made that.

47
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:32,348
Yeah.

48
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,884
Who's Frank?

49
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:38,354
Frank was my husband.

50
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:40,221
Although we never married.

51
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,959
He passed 10 years ago.

52
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:46,062
Oh, I'm sorry.

53
00:05:46,064 --> 00:05:47,630
He did that one up there, too.

54
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:52,969
Oh wow, that's um,
it's very um, rustic.

55
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:53,669
You done?

56
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:55,938
Frank was a fan of imperfection.

57
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,174
Yeah, I can tell.

58
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,209
Hey, are you full?

59
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:03,178
Aunt Jean,
where is your dishwasher?

60
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,647
You're looking at it, kiddo.

61
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:05,848
ABBY:
You don't have a dishwasher?

62
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,418
No dishwasher, no clothes dryer,
no microwave.

63
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,522
- TV?
- No, no TV.

64
00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:17,593
Well, um, I hope you have
a bathtub,

65
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:20,529
'cause it's time for these two
to get ready for bed.

66
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:22,565
No, why don't you do the dishes
and I'll take them up.

67
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:23,799
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

68
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,701
Uh, I... we just have our l...
we have a routine.

69
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:27,670
It's fine.

70
00:06:27,672 --> 00:06:29,739
Come on.

71
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:30,873
Okay.

72
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,308
Hey.

73
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,444
(Kisses)

74
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:37,178
You guys be good.

75
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,617
JEAN: The dish soap is where
you might expect it to be.

76
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:42,918
Okay.

77
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:52,328

78
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,965

79
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,639
Cool scar.

80
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:06,742
I got it in the car crash
with my dad.

81
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:09,645
Here, this one's my favourite.

82
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:11,480
It looks like a crescent moon.

83
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:12,748
Mine looks like a river.

84
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,251
Yes, they mighty Mississippi.

85
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:16,819
(Chuckles)
Come on, let's go.

86
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:18,389
Bed time.

87
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,365
LIBBY:
Oh.

88
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,434
Thanks.

89
00:07:31,436 --> 00:07:33,102
I thought you might like that.

90
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:35,171
- Oh yeah.
- There you go.

91
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:36,474
It's cold.

92
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:44,549
Oh.

93
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:46,649
Oh!

94
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:49,151
There they are,
thank you.

95
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:51,956
(Cow moos in the distance)

96
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:57,593
You know, this won't be forever
just until I get us back

97
00:07:57,595 --> 00:07:59,295
- on our feet.
- Yeah.

98
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:02,398
And I know
it's a lot with the kids.

99
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,466
It's just after Danny,

100
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:05,201
everything kinda just got away
from me

101
00:08:05,203 --> 00:08:08,471
and it's hard to lose
your person and your whole life

102
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:09,472
in a year.

103
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:11,373
(Chuckles)

104
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,177
I really appreciate
you inviting us to stay.

105
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:18,447
I think it's gonna be
a little weird for a while.

106
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:19,949
You don't really know
what I'm made of

107
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:22,685
and I bet your mother's probably
filled your head with

108
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:26,122
a lot of chicken shit about me.

109
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:27,123
Well...

110
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,991
(Chuckles)

111
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:29,992
And you know Marsha,

112
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:33,562
she's got a lot to say
about a lot of things.

113
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:34,697
But I do remember you though,

114
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:37,800
I remember seeing you
at Granddaddy's funeral.

115
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:39,502
You and mom were fighting.

116
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:41,036
Oh yeah.

117
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:43,239
I was a doozy.

118
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:47,943
And your mother always was
a stellar sort of asshole.

119
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:52,014
But let's not talk about things
that make us wanna punch holes

120
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:53,684
in a sheetrock.

121
00:08:58,022 --> 00:09:01,323
(Turkey clucking)

122
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:03,260
You have a lot of pets.

123
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:04,794
- We don't call 'em pets.
- Oh.

124
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:07,163
On a farm, they're animals.

125
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:09,131
And they all have jobs.

126
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:13,102
The hens lay eggs,
the cats keep the mice away,

127
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:16,038
the dogs protect the chickens
from the coyotes,

128
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,642
and the goats make milk.

129
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:20,242
(Turkey clucking)

130
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:21,243
What's his job?

131
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:23,612
(Turkey clucking)

132
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:24,780
Thanksgiving.

133
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:26,348

134
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:35,624

135
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:37,393
(Knocks on door)

136
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:39,361
Yes.

137
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:41,298
(Door squeaks)

138
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,268
Just in case you get cold.

139
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,271
Thanks.

140
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:51,040
Happy new year.

141
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:57,813
(♪♪♪)

142
00:09:57,815 --> 00:10:00,583
Yeah, happy new year.

143
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:06,989
(♪♪♪)

144
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:08,624

00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:11,562
(Cows mooing)

146
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:14,997
JEAN:
You both are doing a good job.

147
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,599
- It's so good.
- It's so good.

148
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:17,933
Thank you.

149
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,271
- TANK: Thanks.
- You're welcome.

150
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:22,771
There she is.

151
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:24,039
Aunt Jean made pancakes

152
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,442
and I had a dream
I was a cute pink goat.

153
00:10:26,444 --> 00:10:29,144
All goats are cute,
pink or not.

154
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:31,046
Try this jam, mama,
Jean made it.

155
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,249
(Gasps)

156
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:35,150
Strawberries and blueberries
from that field in the back.

157
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:37,419
Jean said we could pick 'em
in the summer.

158
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:39,421
And this was Wiggy the piggy.

159
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:40,689
She's delicious.

160
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:42,658
She was a good pig.

161
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,226
What would you like
in your espresso?

162
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:48,097
Wait, you don't have
a dishwasher, but you have this?

163
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:50,399
When it comes to coffee,
I don't mess around.

164
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,234
(Thuds)

165
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,802
(Grunts)

166
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:55,307
(Takes deep breaths)

167
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:57,773
(Door bangs)

168
00:10:57,775 --> 00:11:00,743
This is James O'Connor,
my farm manager.

169
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,312
Would you please
quit calling me that.

170
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:05,315
You make it sound like
I got a desk out in the barn.

171
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:06,749
(Takes a deep breath)

172
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:09,818
You must be the uh,
the long lost niece.

173
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,322
Uh, yeah, that's me.

174
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:13,356
Nice to meet you.

175
00:11:13,358 --> 00:11:16,191
This beautiful girl is Abby

176
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:18,661
and the tall, dark,
and handsome one is Tank.

177
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:20,129
How you doing?
It's just grease.

178
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:22,231
- TANK: Where do you live?
- Where do I live?

179
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,733
I live right out front there
in that silver bullet.

180
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:26,101
You look like a werewolf.

181
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,937
- Abby.
- I...

182
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:30,172
I look like a were...
or maybe I am a werewolf.

183
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:31,073
(Growls)

184
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:32,741
Don't worry, Abby, he's human.

185
00:11:32,743 --> 00:11:35,210
O'Connor's gonna teach your mama
how to run the farm.

186
00:11:35,212 --> 00:11:35,878
- What?
- What?

187
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,213
What, I'm sorry what?

188
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:40,082
- What?
- I need help, you need a job,

189
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:42,051
and he's not gonna stay around
forever.

190
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:44,653
Oh, I... trust me,
I know I need a job,

191
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:47,022
but I'm not sure
I'm the farming type.

192
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:48,791
Yeah, totally agree with that.

193
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:49,825
You don't know me.

194
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:52,628
Well, you're the one
who just said it.

195
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,030
Well, I... I can...
I can just tell.

196
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:56,198
Tell what?

197
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,900
You know what, I don't...
the point is

198
00:11:57,902 --> 00:11:59,336
it's not a good idea.

199
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:00,536
Sure it is.

200
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:03,038
Drink up, get dressed,
and get outside.

201
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,139
Today?

202
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,040
It's a holiday.

203
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,542
There are no holidays on a farm.

204
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:07,710
I let you sleep in this morning,

205
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:09,745
but tomorrow's gonna be
a whole other deal.

206
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:10,579
Come on, kids.

207
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:11,613
Let's go see Russ
at the feed store.

208
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:12,984
- Wait, wait.
- ABBY AND TANK: Bye, mommy.

209
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,750
- Love you.
- Wait.

210
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:15,951
Bye, see you later.

211
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:16,919
Let's go, let's go.

212
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:19,855
Be... be... be careful.

213
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:22,024
Alright, two minutes,
out in the barn.

214
00:12:22,026 --> 00:12:23,058
Where?

215
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,663
That the... that's
the big red structure outback.

216
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:31,403

217
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,007

219
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:42,644
Hey, hey, yo.

220
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:43,981
Here we go.

221
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:49,685
Okay.

222
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:50,953
- What is this?
- LIBBY: What?

223
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:52,455
You don't have a coat.

224
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:55,657
I forgot it at my mom's.

225
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:58,395
Well, these are chickens.

226
00:12:58,397 --> 00:13:01,597
And these are goats.

227
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,664
She told me to start
from scratch,

228
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,799
so that's what I'm gonna do.

229
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:06,035
This one right over here,
that's Ms. Taylor.

230
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:07,970
The one right
there is Katy Perry

231
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:09,171
and the one right back
over there

232
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:11,540
that doesn't belong with anyone,
that's Susan Sontag.

233
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,742
These are Nubians,

234
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:15,077
the ones with the long,
floppy ears.

235
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:17,347
We don't have any Alpines,
but we do have a few Lamanchas

236
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:21,183
and don't show 'em,
we only milk 'em.

237
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:23,218
- Do they all have names?
- Yeah.

238
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,088
They all got names,
but I just call 'em "goat".

239
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,157
And why do you call her
"Aunt Jean", are you related?

240
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:28,991
Uh, no, no.

241
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:30,262
But, she's like family.

242
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:34,433
I'm fine.

243
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:37,168
Come on in.

244
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:42,671
Alright, you gotta wedge it
down first.

245
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:44,606

Alright, here we go.

00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:12,622
If they're open,
you leave 'em open

312
00:16:12,624 --> 00:16:15,190
and if they're closed...

313
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:16,492
Let me guess,
you leave them closed.

314
00:16:16,494 --> 00:16:17,759

00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:40,570
- and then I'll come...
- Why?

365
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:41,637
You don't need to take a shower,

366
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:44,807
the beauty pageant's

367

00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:50,178
Right?

369
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,381
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

370
00:18:51,383 --> 00:18:53,115
Okay.

371
00:18:53,117 --> 00:18:55,052
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

372
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:04,527
We need to hire a real hand.

373
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:06,063
She'll learn.

374
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:13,338

Oh, I was.

399
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:20,155
Hmm, divorced then?

400
00:22:20,157 --> 00:22:22,058
No.

401
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,929
Mysterious, what happened?

402
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:28,698
He's just gone.

403
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,131
Gone where?

404
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:32,835
How much do I owe ya?

405
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:37,974
That would be 48.25.

406
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:39,275
60.

407
00:22:39,277 --> 00:22:42,447
So like gone as in dead?

408
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,885

We're gonna have
our first cheese lesson.

Hey Jean, I just need like um,

419
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,489
I just need like a moment,

420
00:24:00,491 --> 00:24:03,059
because I haven't really had
a shower in three days

421
00:24:03,061 --> 00:24:04,994
and I'm exhausted.

422
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:06,495
And I just need a moment.

423
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:07,496

Oh, and thanks for the...
the overalls.

432
00:25:47,932 --> 00:25:49,598
And do they fit.

433
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,066
You're starting
to look the part.

00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:52,101
(Libby chuckles)

435
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:53,402
Looks can be deceiving.

436
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:56,071
- What are we doing?
- God's work.

437
00:25:56,073 --> 00:25:57,807
We're making chévre.

438
00:25:57,809 --> 00:25:59,175
Come on.

00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:00,009
(Smacks lips)

440
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:01,811
- That sounds hard.
- It's not hard.

441
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:05,781
Here, I want you to put
this milk into that pan.

442
00:26:05,783 --> 00:26:07,316
- (Grunts)
- So here.

443
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:08,285
It's heavy.

444
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:09,385
Pour it all in.

445
00:26:09,387 --> 00:26:11,220
Yeah, that... that's good.

446
00:26:11,222 --> 00:26:13,856
Alright, now this is rennet
and bacteria.

447
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:16,158
You're gonna put
two or three drops in there

448
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,194
and I'm gonna put
this whole thing in there.

449
00:26:18,196 --> 00:26:20,229
And this is gonna help
the milk coagulate.

450
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:21,530
My head feels coagulated.

451
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:22,631
You stir that now.

452
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:25,100
Stir that up.

453
00:26:25,102 --> 00:26:29,605
Um, hey Jean, I just...
listen, I just wanna

454
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:32,708
thank you again
for letting us stay.

455
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,610
I mean you know,
you've been so amazing.

456
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:37,780
And the kids obviously
love it here and...

457
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:39,481
You don't have to
thank me anymore.

458
00:26:39,483 --> 00:26:40,783
You work here now.

459
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:42,585
Well, I just... that's what
I wanna talk to you about.

460
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:46,289
I am not sure that
I'm actually cut out for this.

461
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,156
You know?

462
00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:49,225
I want you to take
those around there

463
00:26:49,227 --> 00:26:51,360
and put 'em on this parchment
paper, nice and even.

464
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:54,297
Come on, pick 'em up
with your bare hands, go ahead.

465
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:55,598
- I...
- That's good, go ahead.

466
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,733
Go ahead.

467
00:26:57,735 --> 00:26:59,368
You can go on, I'm listening.

468
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,204
Well, I just... I don't know
how long we're gonna be here

469
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:05,708
and I don't want you
to depend on me just in case,

470
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,410
you know,
this all doesn't work out.

471
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:11,247
And I... I really appreciate you.

472
00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:12,414
Okay, I understand.

473
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:13,616
Okay?

474
00:27:13,618 --> 00:27:15,551
I'll take you
for as long as I can get you.

475
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:16,719
There.

476
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:18,321
It's alright, you can have
a little bit on your hands.

477
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:20,656
Just salt 'em lightly now,
'cause it's all done.

478
00:27:20,658 --> 00:27:21,757
I'm gonna... it's a...

479
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,192
Just take a teaspoon,
just like you're putting

480
00:27:23,194 --> 00:27:25,561
a little salt on your food
only you're not shaking it.

481
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:27,162
- There you go.
- Okay.

482
00:27:27,164 --> 00:27:29,031
Yeah, you can do that,
pinch it on.

483
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:30,165

Well, Bartley, sounds like
we have a full house.

488
00:27:50,588 --> 00:27:52,087
What do you have
in your backpack?

489
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:54,890
Ooh, okay,
let's go, please hurry.

490
00:27:54,892 --> 00:27:57,159
Come on, Abby,
I don't wanna be late.

491
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:58,328
Here you go.

492
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,131
Okay.

Bug,
you're doing such a good job.

494
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:09,571
Isn't the milk glass pretty,
mama?

495
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:11,006
It really is.

496
00:28:11,008 --> 00:28:12,409
You know what else is pretty?

497
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:13,410

We're having company for dinner.

We are?

501
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:18,614
You better go get cleaned up.

502
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:20,751
Yes, ma'am.

503
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,788
Can you go get the bread?

513
00:28:46,477 --> 00:28:48,544
Libby,
this is my boyfriend Russ.

514
00:28:48,546 --> 00:28:50,112
- LIBBY: Hi.

515
00:28:50,114 --> 00:28:51,448
Give me a hug, I wanna hug you.

516
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,783
And this is his beautiful
granddaughter Sunshine.

517
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:57,052
Hi, how's it going?

518
00:28:57,054 --> 00:28:57,886
Hi.

519
00:28:57,888 --> 00:29:00,089
These are for you.

520
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:01,056
For me, why?

521
00:29:01,058 --> 00:29:03,393
Well, you're the niece
of the woman I love.

522
00:29:03,395 --> 00:29:04,394
It's a bribe.

523
00:29:04,396 --> 00:29:05,961
Don't listen to her.

524
00:29:05,963 --> 00:29:08,431
I need all the help I can get
with this one.

525
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:10,232
I need you on my side.

526
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:13,068
Now she is one of them
hippie Liberals

527
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,903
and I'm a Conservative lawyer.

528
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:16,439
Wait, I thought you owned
the feed store.

529
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:19,241
Well, I'm also entrepreneur.

530
00:29:19,243 --> 00:29:22,111
Now just tell me you're not one
of them hippies or Liberals,

531
00:29:22,113 --> 00:29:23,078
are you?

532
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,913
I'm not really sure what I am.

533
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:26,949
She's undecided,
that means she's a Liberal.

534
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:28,217
That's one for my side.

535
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:29,718
What?

536
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,787
Oh now, come on now,
that's not right.

537
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:32,957
Sorry, Russ.

538
00:29:40,298 --> 00:29:42,131
Jean, how you feelin'?

539
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:44,199
Well, my fingers are
a little swollen

540
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:47,169
when I get up in the morning
these days, aching, you know...

541
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:49,538
- No, no, no, Jean.
- Just things like that.

542
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,777
I mean, how are you feeling?

543
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,279
I don't know.

544
00:29:56,281 --> 00:30:00,517
Worried, hopeful.

00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:19,482
How long you guys been divorced?

725
00:38:19,484 --> 00:38:20,983
You know, I'd... I'd...
I'd actually prefer

726
00:38:20,985 --> 00:38:22,385
to talk about Marsha.

727
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:24,085
LIBBY:
Marsha.

728
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:25,988
She's very beautiful.

729
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,524
She still is very beautiful.

730
00:38:28,526 --> 00:38:31,494
Travel agent,
been married four times.

731
00:38:31,496 --> 00:38:32,795
She's a piece of work.

732
00:38:32,797 --> 00:38:36,064
I think I was like 6
when she'd decided

733
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:38,734
I didn't need a babysitter
anymore.

734
00:38:38,736 --> 00:38:41,003
I remember I was so scared
whenever she would leave me.

735
00:38:41,005 --> 00:38:42,438
(Yawning)

736
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,841
I would... I would stay
in my closet with the um,

737
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:47,777
you know the high horses.

738
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:50,145
You know, those like sticks
with the little horse heads

739
00:38:50,147 --> 00:38:51,146
on top.

740
00:38:51,148 --> 00:38:53,282
I would sit in my closet
with that.

741
00:38:53,284 --> 00:38:54,784
And sometimes,
I would wake up there,

742
00:38:54,786 --> 00:38:58,387
'cause I think she just forgot
to come check on me.

743
00:38:58,389 --> 00:39:00,056
Well, that sucks.

744
00:39:00,058 --> 00:39:03,259
Yeah, but no, not that bad.

745
00:39:03,261 --> 00:39:06,194
(Quivering)

746
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:08,299
Hey, come sit.

747
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:18,443
Lean back against that.

748
00:39:22,013 --> 00:39:23,045
Thanks.

749
00:39:23,047 --> 00:39:23,982
Yeah.

750
00:39:25,148 --> 00:39:26,147
Oh God.

751
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:28,116
(Grunts)

752
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:29,418
Oh, this stinks.

753
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:35,426
(♪♪♪)

754
00:40:13,865 --> 00:40:16,966
Y'all have a little
cold weather campout?

755
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:19,001
(Grunts)

756
00:40:19,003 --> 00:40:20,036
Oh God, oh.

757
00:40:20,038 --> 00:40:20,870
(Russ laughs)

758
00:40:20,872 --> 00:40:21,937
Thank you!

759
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:22,838
Oh God!

760
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,073
It was so cold.

761
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:25,240
Wooh!

762
00:40:25,242 --> 00:40:27,242
This one got us locked in.

763
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:30,579
Who fixes a door
in the middle of night?

764
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:32,615
The one, who knows how to get
a job done, that's who.

765
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:35,183
Well, this one's got an answer
for everything, doesn't he?

766
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:36,519
Ooh.

767
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:39,355
Like you got an answer
for everything, too.

768
00:40:39,357 --> 00:40:40,958
(Chuckles)

769
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:45,096
(Indistinct chatter)

770
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,067
(Bell rings)

771
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:51,967
GIRL 1:
See you tomorrow.

772
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:54,138
- Bye.
- Bye.

773
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:59,909
(Indistinct chatter)

774
00:40:59,911 --> 00:41:03,145
Where did you get
that funny shirt, new girl.

775
00:41:03,147 --> 00:41:07,149
You're so ugly you'd scare
a buzzard off a gut cart.

776
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:09,787
What are you gonna do, limper?

777
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:16,292
(Phone ringing)

778
00:41:16,294 --> 00:41:17,893
- Mrs. Moran?
- Yes.

779
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:18,963
Hi.

780
00:41:22,867 --> 00:41:24,400
Are you sure
it was Abby's fault,

781
00:41:24,402 --> 00:41:26,035
because she's really...
she's not a fighter.

782
00:41:26,037 --> 00:41:27,470
She's never even hit anybody
in her life.

783
00:41:27,472 --> 00:41:28,671
- I mean...
- Well, it's never easy

784
00:41:28,673 --> 00:41:30,706
starting at a new school.

785
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,341
But we have
a zero tolerance policy

786
00:41:32,343 --> 00:41:34,242
for violence here.

787
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:36,479
Abby will have to use her words
instead of her karate chops

788
00:41:36,481 --> 00:41:37,947
when she's teased.

789
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:39,949
Teased about what?

790
00:41:39,951 --> 00:41:42,685
Mrs. Moran, Abby's not the first
and she certainly

791
00:41:42,687 --> 00:41:44,520
won't be the last gawky child.

792
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:47,790
She... she has a limp
from a car accident.

793
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:49,825
It's the same car accident
that killed her father

794
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:51,861
and my daughter knows more
about pain and hard work...

795
00:41:51,863 --> 00:41:53,796
Mrs. Moran.

796
00:41:53,798 --> 00:41:55,831
This isn't a great way
to start a new school.

797
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,835
It's grounds for suspension.

798
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:00,736
What is going on?

799
00:42:00,738 --> 00:42:05,007
I mean what...
this is not like you.

800
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:06,075
He called me "limper".

801
00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:09,044
Okay, that kid is a jerk,

802
00:42:09,046 --> 00:42:11,680
but you cannot just go around
hitting people.

803
00:42:11,682 --> 00:42:14,450
You have to use your words,
okay?

804
00:42:14,452 --> 00:42:15,818
(Sighs)

805
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,521
I mean how do you even know
karate in the first place?

806
00:42:18,523 --> 00:42:20,523
O'Connor.

807
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:21,192
What?

808
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:31,867
(Goats bleating)

809
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:34,036
(Knocks)

810
00:42:34,038 --> 00:42:35,037
It's Libby.

811
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:36,007
Mom.

812
00:42:38,743 --> 00:42:39,909
Hey, oh hey, Abby.

813
00:42:39,911 --> 00:42:43,879
Um, did you teach her
how to fight?

814
00:42:43,881 --> 00:42:45,714
- Yeah, a couple of moves.
- Well, thank you,

815
00:42:45,716 --> 00:42:47,783
because my child just got
suspended for a week.

816
00:42:47,785 --> 00:42:49,652
You finally got that Jimmy kid.

817
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:51,187
I got him right
in the solar plexus.

818
00:42:51,189 --> 00:42:52,521
- (Chuckles)
- Nice work.

819
00:42:52,523 --> 00:42:54,490
No.

820
00:42:54,492 --> 00:42:56,826
No, not nice work.

821
00:42:56,828 --> 00:42:59,128
How does he know about Jimmy?

822
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:01,096
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm your mother.

823
00:43:01,098 --> 00:43:02,698
Because I knew you would
stress out about it.

824
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,899
What, I'm not stressed out!

825
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:05,601
Mom, you're stressing out
right now.

826
00:43:05,603 --> 00:43:08,771
Abby, I'm fine,
I can handle this, I'm cool.

827
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:10,241
You could've told me.

828
00:43:13,511 --> 00:43:14,910
I need you to go to your room.

829
00:43:14,912 --> 00:43:16,378
- Go to your room.
- Yeah.

830
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,479
Don't...

831
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:18,547
- Go to your room.
- Don't...

832
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:22,252
Don't ever do that again.

833
00:43:22,254 --> 00:43:24,220
- Why are you mad at her?
- I'm not mad at her.

834
00:43:24,222 --> 00:43:25,421
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not.

835
00:43:25,423 --> 00:43:26,488
She's been getting picked on
ever since

836
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:27,423
she got to that school.

837
00:43:27,425 --> 00:43:29,925
I'm mad at you.

838
00:43:29,927 --> 00:43:34,396
She didn't tell you, because
she's trying to protect you.

839
00:43:34,398 --> 00:43:36,033
What?
Protect me from what?

840
00:43:39,103 --> 00:43:41,606
I hope she kicked the piss
out of him.

841
00:43:45,877 --> 00:43:54,253
(♪♪♪)

842
00:44:15,274 --> 00:44:17,208
Hey.

843
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,076
You know what that kid said,
it was awful

844
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:24,179
and he probably got
what he deserved.

845
00:44:24,181 --> 00:44:29,551
And I am so proud of you
for standing up for yourself.

846
00:44:29,553 --> 00:44:32,054
I miss daddy.

847
00:44:32,056 --> 00:44:33,624
Look, I know.

848
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:37,828
I know.

849
00:44:40,431 --> 00:44:41,699
I do, too.

850
00:44:45,436 --> 00:44:48,837
I like it here on the farm.

851
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,572
Are we gonna stay, mama?

852
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:52,708
I don't know.

853
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:57,212
You know what I do know that
whatever happens,

854
00:44:57,214 --> 00:44:59,351
we're gonna be okay.

855
00:45:01,386 --> 00:45:02,419
Promise?

856
00:45:02,421 --> 00:45:04,421
Oh.

857
00:45:04,423 --> 00:45:06,021
Promise.

859
00:45:11,562 --> 00:45:14,333
- Can I spend the night?
- Yeah.

860
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:21,236

just put a little bit of salt.

00:47:37,309 --> 00:47:39,875
that he had prepared
cu... curry..."

906
00:47:39,877 --> 00:47:42,010
- Ooh.
- How do you say that word?

907
00:47:42,012 --> 00:47:43,513
- Curry.
- Curry.

908
00:47:43,515 --> 00:47:44,646
Curry shrimp.

909
00:47:44,648 --> 00:47:46,249
It's too spicy.

910
00:47:46,251 --> 00:47:56,193
(♪♪♪)

911
00:48:33,764 --> 00:48:35,598
(Grunts)

912
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,400
Okay.

913
00:48:37,402 --> 00:48:38,834
(Takes a deep breath)

914
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:40,202
What are we plantin'?

915
00:48:40,204 --> 00:48:44,206
Nothing aspirational,
only what we can eat.

916
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:46,942
I'm not gonna plant another bed
of artichokes

917
00:48:46,944 --> 00:48:48,844
for no good reason.

918
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:51,949
(Birds chirping)

919
00:48:54,952 --> 00:48:57,853
It really is pretty here.

920
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,324
I thought you'd like it.

921
00:49:05,896 --> 00:49:08,697
Hey Jean,
can I ask you a question?

922
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:11,700
Sure.

923
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:13,570
How long did it take you?

924
00:49:13,572 --> 00:49:14,504
Plant all these?

925
00:49:14,506 --> 00:49:17,041
- Not long.
- Mm-mm, you know, to um...

926
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:23,879
To...
to get over Frank?

927
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:25,383
(Sighs)

928
00:49:27,552 --> 00:49:31,153
Initially, I was never gonna
get over Frank.

929
00:49:31,155 --> 00:49:33,323
I hunkered down in my sadness

930
00:49:33,325 --> 00:49:35,560
and I refused to come up
for air.

931
00:49:37,429 --> 00:49:41,666
Then slowly,
I got back to living.

932
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:48,338
Life keeps chugging along
whether we like it or not.

933
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:55,645
Sometimes, I just feel like
I'm drowning, you know?

934
00:49:55,647 --> 00:50:02,217
This kinda pain and loss,
it cracks you open.

935
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:06,556
But we are made of magic
and resilience, Libby.

936
00:50:06,558 --> 00:50:09,259
Losing someone you love,

937
00:50:09,261 --> 00:50:11,563
that scar
will feel ugly forever.

938
00:50:13,531 --> 00:50:14,965
But it will heal.

939
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:22,137
You promise?

940
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:24,072
I can speak from experience.

941
00:50:24,074 --> 00:50:29,079
(♪♪♪)

942
00:50:34,218 --> 00:50:36,020
Is that too close?

943
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:47,965
(♪♪♪)

944
00:50:56,574 --> 00:50:59,041
O'CONNOR: Farmer's market is
easy, I don't...

945
00:50:59,043 --> 00:51:01,344
I don't know why Jean waited
so long to show you.

946
00:51:01,346 --> 00:51:02,545
I do.

947
00:51:02,547 --> 00:51:06,915
I used to live in Houston,
haven't been back since we left.

948
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:08,850
You moving back?

949
00:51:08,852 --> 00:51:09,951
I don't know.

950
00:51:09,953 --> 00:51:11,754
I have to get a real job,
I can't run a farm,

951
00:51:11,756 --> 00:51:13,389
I've gotta make money.

952
00:51:13,391 --> 00:51:14,856
Excuse me.

953
00:51:14,858 --> 00:51:16,559
Milking goats, isn't a real job?

954
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:18,827
You know what I mean,
I gotta send my kids to college.

955
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:20,396
College isn't necessary.

956
00:51:20,398 --> 00:51:21,897
My kids are going to college.

957
00:51:21,899 --> 00:51:23,433
O'CONNOR:
Why?

958
00:51:23,435 --> 00:51:25,000
So they can have a good life.

959
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:27,903
- To...
- O'CONNOR: Okay.

960
00:51:27,905 --> 00:51:29,772
- Did you go to college?
- Yep.

961
00:51:29,774 --> 00:51:30,939
LIBBY:
Do you have a good life?

962
00:51:30,941 --> 00:51:34,876
Not because I went to college.

963
00:51:34,878 --> 00:51:36,346
- Did you go to college?
- Yes.

964
00:51:36,348 --> 00:51:38,283
O'CONNOR: Yeah,
and how is that working out for you?

965
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:42,117
Okay, well, my life
didn't turn out

966
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,553
exactly the way
it was supposed to.

967
00:51:43,555 --> 00:51:45,087
Well, that's true
for pretty much everyone, Libby.

968
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:46,922
So you're just against
higher education?

969
00:51:46,924 --> 00:51:48,125
O'CONNOR:
Yeah, it's a racket.

970
00:51:49,594 --> 00:51:51,294
The world is falling apart
anyway.

971
00:51:51,296 --> 00:51:53,329
Look, what you should be showing
your kids how to do

972
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:56,432
is hotwire a car, how to hunt,
how to fish,

973
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:58,133
how to fend for themselves.

974
00:51:58,135 --> 00:52:01,169
That, that is what's gonna
come in handy

975
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:02,904
when the apocalypse comes.

976
00:52:02,906 --> 00:52:04,275
You realize you sound crazy?

977
00:52:05,943 --> 00:52:07,209
Maybe I am crazy.

978
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:08,378
LIBBY:
Yeah.

979
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,146
Tank and Abby are gonna be
just fine,

980
00:52:11,148 --> 00:52:14,149
they're both survivors.

981
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:19,156
(♪♪♪)

982
00:52:32,837 --> 00:52:36,037
(Indistinct chatter)

983
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:41,044
(♪♪♪)

984
00:52:52,022 --> 00:52:53,723
(Laughter)

985
00:52:53,725 --> 00:52:56,559
CUSTOMER 1: One Doris and
two Angelina Jolies please.

986
00:52:56,561 --> 00:52:58,226
Good choice.

987
00:52:58,228 --> 00:53:00,696
My son loves Angelina Jolie,
too.

988
00:53:00,698 --> 00:53:02,765
She just has a way with kids
all over the world.

989
00:53:02,767 --> 00:53:03,633
(Laughs)

990
00:53:03,635 --> 00:53:04,634
Get it?

991
00:53:04,636 --> 00:53:05,568
Okay.

992
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:06,502
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

993
00:53:06,504 --> 00:53:09,237
Stop it, Libby,
it's not so funny.

994
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:11,541
Oh my God.

995
00:53:11,543 --> 00:53:12,775
Libby Moran?

996
00:53:12,777 --> 00:53:14,444
- Girls, it's Libby.
- (Jessica and friends gasp)

997
00:53:14,446 --> 00:53:16,779
- (Indiscernible speech)
- Oh my gosh.

998
00:53:16,781 --> 00:53:17,814
Hi!

999
00:53:17,816 --> 00:53:18,748
- (Laughs)
- BECKA: It's Libby!

1000
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:19,782
Hi.

1001
00:53:19,784 --> 00:53:20,783
Huh, look at you.

1002
00:53:20,785 --> 00:53:21,717
(Kissing)

1003
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:22,951
L... Libby.

1004
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:24,720
Hi.

1005
00:53:24,722 --> 00:53:26,689
Oh my God, we haven't seen you
since the funeral.

1006
00:53:26,691 --> 00:53:28,990
- Yeah.
- Oh, I miss Danny so much.

1007
00:53:28,992 --> 00:53:30,827
How are you really?

1008
00:53:30,829 --> 00:53:32,595
How are you?

1009
00:53:32,597 --> 00:53:33,563
I'm... I'm good.

1010
00:53:33,565 --> 00:53:35,465
I'm... I'm... you know, the kids
are really...

1011
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:37,567
- Are you making cheese?
- Oh.

1012
00:53:37,569 --> 00:53:39,569
Um, helping out.

1013
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:41,169
- And just selling.
- We buy it every week.

1014
00:53:41,171 --> 00:53:42,204
Yeah, no, that is so cute.

1015
00:53:42,206 --> 00:53:43,339
- Adorable.
- LANIE: We love it.

1016
00:53:43,341 --> 00:53:47,844
Ooh um, oh well, um,
I'll take a... a Rosie

1017
00:53:47,846 --> 00:53:50,646
and um a... a Doris.

1018
00:53:50,648 --> 00:53:51,681
Okay.

1019
00:53:51,683 --> 00:53:55,116
Um, Rosie, Doris.

1020
00:53:55,118 --> 00:53:58,254
Okay, okay, that is $10.

1021
00:53:58,256 --> 00:53:59,789
You can keep the change.

1022
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:01,290
Oh no, we don't take tips.

1023
00:54:01,292 --> 00:54:03,326
Oh well, yeah, actually...
speak for yourself.

1024
00:54:03,328 --> 00:54:05,695
We do actually take tips.

1025
00:54:05,697 --> 00:54:07,697
- (Laughs)
- I guess we take tips.

1026
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:08,598
(Chuckles)

1027
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,399
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go grab
a cider.

1028
00:54:10,401 --> 00:54:12,668
Guess we take tips.

1029
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:15,738
Okay, you work
with the hot farmer?

1030
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,440
Who?

1031
00:54:17,442 --> 00:54:18,841
Oh, that's what we call him.

1032
00:54:18,843 --> 00:54:21,176
Him?

1033
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:22,345
He's the reason we come here.

1034
00:54:22,347 --> 00:54:24,112
Mhmm, he's hot.

1035
00:54:24,114 --> 00:54:25,481
Ridiculously hot.

1036
00:54:25,483 --> 00:54:26,214
Wooh.

1037
00:54:26,216 --> 00:54:27,316
Yeah.

1038
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:28,417
Yeah, he's yeah.

1039
00:54:28,419 --> 00:54:29,952
Okay, wait a minute.

1040
00:54:29,954 --> 00:54:34,290
Are you two... are you two
making cheese together?

1041
00:54:34,292 --> 00:54:39,462
- No.
- I mean, what?

1042
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:40,363
- Are you?
- No.

1043
00:54:40,365 --> 00:54:41,430
- LANIE: Come on.
- Oh God.

1044
00:54:41,432 --> 00:54:42,798
- LANIE: You can tell us.
- (Jessica screams)

1045
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,834
- I don't want to kiss and tell.
- You can tell us.

1046
00:54:44,836 --> 00:54:46,435
I mean,
we've made some cheese together.

1047
00:54:46,437 --> 00:54:48,337
- Oh!
- Sometimes.

1048
00:54:48,339 --> 00:54:49,472
- Wow!
- Wow.

1049
00:54:49,474 --> 00:54:51,239
- Well, good for you.
- Yeah.

1050
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:53,342
You've totally moved on.

1051
00:54:53,344 --> 00:54:55,645
Oh, wasn't Danny
the sweetest guy ever though?

1052
00:54:55,647 --> 00:54:57,346
- Hmm, just exquisite.
- Miss you, miss you.

1053
00:54:57,348 --> 00:55:00,616
Ugh, a diamond in the rough.

1054
00:55:00,618 --> 00:55:01,651
(Grunts)

1055
00:55:01,653 --> 00:55:04,787
I... can you just give me a...

1056
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:06,856
Hey, I'll be right back.

1057
00:55:06,858 --> 00:55:07,757
Thank you for sharing.

1058
00:55:07,759 --> 00:55:09,124
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

1059
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:11,126
Hi.

1060
00:55:11,128 --> 00:55:12,295
- Bye.
- (Laughing)

1061
00:55:12,297 --> 00:55:13,896
Bye.
Go.

1062
00:55:13,898 --> 00:55:14,997
BECKA:
See ya next week.

1063
00:55:14,999 --> 00:55:16,532
Yeah.

1064
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:19,637
(Taking deep breaths)

1065
00:55:26,411 --> 00:55:27,276
(Overlapping speech)

1066
00:55:27,278 --> 00:55:29,045
Hey, that was so sad.

1067
00:55:29,047 --> 00:55:32,682
Ugh, what is it about her
that is so irritating?

1068
00:55:32,684 --> 00:55:34,584
BECKA: She's just one of those
people, mhmm, mhmm.

1069
00:55:34,586 --> 00:55:36,752
JESSICA: Hey y'all,
you know I feel sorry for her.

1070
00:55:36,754 --> 00:55:38,254
Her husband dies
in a car accident,

1071
00:55:38,256 --> 00:55:39,655
- leaves them broke.
- Hmm.

1072
00:55:39,657 --> 00:55:41,390
I went to her estate sale.

1073
00:55:41,392 --> 00:55:42,391
LANIE:
Come on, you didn't.

1074
00:55:42,393 --> 00:55:43,593
- JESSICA: I sure did.
- LANIE: Oh.

1075
00:55:43,595 --> 00:55:45,494
She had the same
wedding china as me.

1076
00:55:45,496 --> 00:55:48,998
Y'all, don't judge, but I bought
every last piece of it.

1077
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,066
(Chuckles)

1078
00:55:50,068 --> 00:55:51,867
Now I have plate settings
for 24.

1079
00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:52,568
That's amazing.

1080
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:53,703
Good thing I'm popular.

1081
00:55:53,705 --> 00:55:54,704
(Laughing)

1082
00:55:54,706 --> 00:55:56,439
LANIE: Okay,
there's no way she's sleeping

1083
00:55:56,441 --> 00:55:57,640
with the hot farmer.

1084
00:55:57,642 --> 00:55:58,608
BECKA:
You don't think she's lying?

1085
00:55:58,610 --> 00:55:59,609
LANIE:
Oh, give me a break.

1086
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:00,576
Hello, she looks like
she's wearing

1087
00:56:00,578 --> 00:56:01,477
a Halloween costume.

1088
00:56:01,479 --> 00:56:03,079
(Chuckles)
She's like a lumberjack.

1089
00:56:03,081 --> 00:56:04,814
LANIE:
It's... from a truck stop.

1090
00:56:04,816 --> 00:56:06,983
(Friend laughing)

1091
00:56:06,985 --> 00:56:08,384
Do y'all think I need botox?

1092
00:56:08,386 --> 00:56:09,452
- Oh.
- What?

1093
00:56:09,454 --> 00:56:10,686
- That here.
- You look beautiful, no.

1094
00:56:10,688 --> 00:56:12,421
No, you still look so young
from the last time.

1095
00:56:12,423 --> 00:56:13,723
- Yeah, mhmm.
- Thank you.

1096
00:56:13,725 --> 00:56:15,658
- Let's go.
- I love it, I'm way behind.

1097
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,594
Oh.

1099
00:56:37,247 --> 00:56:38,347
O'CONNOR:
Yeah, alright.

1100
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:41,350
Thank you.
Yeah, see you next week.

1101
00:56:41,352 --> 00:56:43,252
Hey, we need to leave.

1102
00:56:43,254 --> 00:56:44,320
- What?
- I need to leave.

1103
00:56:44,322 --> 00:56:45,287
I need to leave.

1104
00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:46,355
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
slow down.

1105
00:56:46,357 --> 00:56:48,357
- What's... what's going on?
- We need to go.

1106
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:50,292
Those women that were here,
they hate me.

1107
00:56:50,294 --> 00:56:51,293
They think you're hot.

1108
00:56:51,295 --> 00:56:52,628
I might have accidentally
told them that

1109
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,096
we were making cheese together.

1110
00:56:54,098 --> 00:56:56,732
And... and... and they're just
they're terrible people

1111
00:56:56,734 --> 00:56:58,834
and I just really wanna go home
and they think I'm dressed like

1112
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:00,269
a scarecrow, so...

1113
00:57:00,271 --> 00:57:01,737
(Sighs)

1114
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:04,340

(Indistinct chattering)

1116
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:16,988
I hate terrible people.

1117
00:57:19,323 --> 00:57:20,723
Well, that's that.

1118
00:57:20,725 --> 00:57:21,590
Mhmm.

1119
00:57:21,592 --> 00:57:23,191
Well, that was gross.

1120
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:24,093
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1121
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:25,029
Yeah.

1122
00:57:29,634 --> 00:57:30,599
LIBBY:
Yeah, I really do.

1123

You are to,
you're doing pretty good.

Hello.

1128
00:57:40,044 --> 00:57:41,846
When?

1129

Alright, I'm on my way.

1130
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:47,249
I'm on my way right now.

1131
00:57:47,251 --> 00:57:48,216
Okay.

1132
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:49,952
What?

1133
00:57:49,954 --> 00:57:51,487
It's Aaron.

1134
00:57:51,489 --> 00:57:52,488
I'm sorry, I gotta...

1135
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:54,390
- Oh.
- I gotta go.

1136
00:57:54,392 --> 00:57:56,394
It's okay, go, I got this.

1137
00:57:57,395 --> 00:58:00,465
(Truck engine starts)

1138
00:58:06,471 --> 00:58:08,971
(Thunder rumbles)

1139
00:58:08,973 --> 00:58:10,875
(Crickets chirping)

1140

You know we can switch off,

Yeah, we can switch 'em off.

1145

Hi, mama.

1147

Mama, we made hats.

1148
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,118
Oh my gosh!

1149
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,587
The tinfoil makes
our brain waves move faster.

1150
00:58:24,589 --> 00:58:27,022
Well, who doesn't want that.

1151
00:58:27,024 --> 00:58:28,390
Look at you.

1152
00:58:28,392 --> 00:58:29,859
Are you guys done?

1153
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:31,594
Okay, why don't you go upstairs,
wash up,

1154
00:58:31,596 --> 00:58:33,696
brush those dirty chompers.

1155
00:58:33,698 --> 00:58:34,864
What do you have on your nose?

1156
00:58:34,866 --> 00:58:36,065
(Kids laughing)

1157
00:58:36,067 --> 00:58:37,433
LIBBY: And um,
I'll come up and I'll read you a story.

- Yeah.

1159
00:58:38,202 --> 00:58:39,835
Great.

1160

Go!

- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1162
00:58:43,307 --> 00:58:44,106
Goodnight, Aunt Jean.

Goodnight.

Ain't he sweet?

1166
00:58:49,147 --> 00:58:51,947
He's cute.

1168
00:58:53,851 --> 00:58:55,417
JEAN:
How was the market?

1169
00:58:55,419 --> 00:58:58,821
Um, better than expected.

1170
00:58:58,823 --> 00:59:01,323
O'Connor had to um,
just run off.

1171
00:59:01,325 --> 00:59:03,025
Uh, something happened
with Aaron.

1172
00:59:03,027 --> 00:59:04,627
Oh goodness.

1173
00:59:04,629 --> 00:59:06,462
I'll have to call
and check on him.

1174
00:59:06,464 --> 00:59:07,563
Who's Aaron?

1175
00:59:07,565 --> 00:59:08,764
His ex-wife.

1176
00:59:08,766 --> 00:59:10,267
She had a stroke
some years back.

1177
00:59:10,269 --> 00:59:11,200
LIBBY:
How old is she?

1178
00:59:11,202 --> 00:59:13,169
Same age as him.

1179
00:59:13,171 --> 00:59:16,305
A nurse takes care of her,
but he's out there all the time.

1180
00:59:16,307 --> 00:59:18,340
That sucks.

1181

(Knocks on door)

1182
00:59:20,611 --> 00:59:22,478
Who could that be?

1183
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,879
I don't know anybody who knocks.

1184
00:59:23,881 --> 00:59:25,314
Nobody knocks in that order.

1185
00:59:25,316 --> 00:59:26,651
No.

1186
00:59:33,457 --> 00:59:35,591
Looks like they released
the Kraken.

1187
00:59:35,593 --> 00:59:38,696
(Chuckling)

1188
00:59:39,864 --> 00:59:42,200
I'm here to see my daughter
and my grandchildren.

1189
00:59:51,108 --> 00:59:54,510

1190
00:59:54,512 --> 00:59:56,545
What are you doing here?

1191
00:59:56,547 --> 01:00:02,351
Um, well, uh, making cheese.

1192
01:00:02,353 --> 01:00:04,153
Um, goat cheese,
and then...

1193
01:00:04,155 --> 01:00:08,424
No, honey,
I mean what are you doing?

1194
01:00:08,426 --> 01:00:09,861
What are you doing here?

1195
01:00:13,464 --> 01:00:16,266
You can come home now, you can.

1196
01:00:16,268 --> 01:00:18,367
I forgive you.

1197
01:00:18,369 --> 01:00:19,635
Forgive me for what?

1198
01:00:19,637 --> 01:00:20,936
For leaving.

1199
01:00:20,938 --> 01:00:25,107
Well, you made it pretty clear
that um, we were nearing

1200
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:26,876
our expiration date.

1201
01:00:26,878 --> 01:00:29,378
You'd been sleeping on my couch
for six months.

1202
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:30,579
I was having a hard time.

1203
01:00:30,581 --> 01:00:33,616
I know, and I was trying
to motivate you,

1204
01:00:33,618 --> 01:00:36,452
because I did not raise you
to be a victim.

1205
01:00:36,454 --> 01:00:38,387
You cannot throw your life away
if he was not worth it...

01:00:38,389 --> 01:00:41,857
Marsha!

1207
01:00:41,859 --> 01:00:46,296
These kids have to go to bed,

Goodnight, Marsha.

01:00:48,499 --> 01:00:50,165
Goodnight.

1211
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,567
Goodnight, my babies.

Yep, you got taller.

01:00:57,141 --> 01:00:58,807
That's good, honey.

1217
01:00:58,809 --> 01:01:00,843
So stand up straight.

1218
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:02,578
Come on, let's see it.

That's right.

I really... I can't believe that
you're being so ungrateful.

1221
01:01:16,961 --> 01:01:19,495
I'd given you everything.

1222

I gave you an education.

01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:24,667
I gave you
all those really nice clothes,

1224
01:01:24,669 --> 01:01:26,735

all those great vacations.

Mama, let's...
you left me hotel rooms, so...

1226

Yeah, okay.

I'm staying here for now, okay?

1233

Why?

This is not you, Libby.

This isn't you.

What's me?

Tell me, what is me.

1238

You're not meant
for a small town,

01:01:55,866 --> 01:01:59,034
you're not meant for a farm,
this...

Mama, what am I meant for?

1241
01:02:00,237 --> 01:02:01,904
'Cause I don't know
what I'm meant for.

when you come home.

I don't have a home!

Where do I go?

This is all I've got,

01:02:30,835 --> 01:02:32,169
You... you get to choose the time
when you do this.

1259
01:02:32,471 --> 01:02:33,902
Okay, you know what,
thank you so much

1260
01:02:33,904 --> 01:02:35,472
for letting us stay
at your house.

1261
01:02:35,474 --> 01:02:36,339
Is that okay?

1262
01:02:36,341 --> 01:02:37,673
Thank you so much

1263
01:02:37,675 --> 01:02:39,409
and I hope you have
a safe drive back home.

1264
01:02:39,411 --> 01:02:40,276
Does that sound good?

1265
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:41,710
There you go.

1266
01:02:41,712 --> 01:02:43,382
(Gasps)
Libby?

1267
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:53,591
Stupid.

1268
01:02:57,962 --> 01:03:00,062
You look tired, Jean.

1269
01:03:00,064 --> 01:03:02,531
I was just gonna say
the same thing about you.

1270
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:03,868
Hmm.

1271
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:08,873
(Rain puttering)

1272
01:03:11,675 --> 01:03:13,876
I know you're trying to turn her
against me.

1273
01:03:13,878 --> 01:03:15,445
Did you tell her yet?

1274
01:03:15,447 --> 01:03:18,047
Not yet.

1275
01:03:18,049 --> 01:03:19,449
She's gonna be just
as disappointed in you

1276
01:03:19,451 --> 01:03:21,216
as she is in me.

1277
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:22,217
Maybe.

1278
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:25,156
Well, I know her
and she's gonna come back to me.

1279
01:03:30,362 --> 01:03:32,295
God, I hate this place.

1280
01:03:32,297 --> 01:03:33,595
S...

1281
01:03:33,597 --> 01:03:35,465
These people.

1282
01:03:35,467 --> 01:03:37,833
It's all so small.

1283
01:03:37,835 --> 01:03:41,036
Lucky for us,
you don't live here anymore.

1284
01:03:41,038 --> 01:03:42,173
Yeah.

1285
01:03:45,277 --> 01:03:47,544
Why do you even live here
when you could be living

1286
01:03:47,546 --> 01:03:48,644
up there?

1287
01:03:48,646 --> 01:03:50,346
I'll never live
in that house again.

1288
01:03:50,348 --> 01:03:52,350
'Cause you're stubborn,
just like Papa.

1289
01:03:58,923 --> 01:04:00,622
You've always been jealous
of me.

1290
01:04:00,624 --> 01:04:03,295
I never even think about you.

1291
01:04:07,566 --> 01:04:17,476
(♪♪♪)

1292
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:23,881
(Car starts)

1293
01:04:30,522 --> 01:04:34,022
(Goats bleating)

1294
01:04:34,024 --> 01:04:35,425
Good girl, come on.

1295
01:04:35,427 --> 01:04:36,394
Let's go, come on.

1296
01:04:48,473 --> 01:04:51,006
- Hey.
- Hey.

1297
01:04:51,008 --> 01:04:54,643
Hey uh, I'm sorry
I guess I'm the new O'Connor.

1298
01:04:54,645 --> 01:04:56,011
Oh!

1299
01:04:56,013 --> 01:04:59,249
Yeah, uh, Jean asked me to come
help out with uh...

1300
01:04:59,251 --> 01:05:01,783
Have you ever done
any of this before?

1301
01:05:01,785 --> 01:05:03,620
How hard could it be?

1302
01:05:03,622 --> 01:05:05,421
(Chuckles)

1303
01:05:05,423 --> 01:05:06,422
Nice shoes.

1304
01:05:06,424 --> 01:05:07,823
Oh, thanks.

1305
01:05:07,825 --> 01:05:08,757
They're new.

1306
01:05:08,759 --> 01:05:09,825
Yeah.

1307
01:05:09,827 --> 01:05:11,561
Not for long.

1308
01:05:11,563 --> 01:05:13,128
Um, grab that feed.

1309
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:15,565
Okay.

1310
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:16,468
Hurry up.

1311
01:05:20,472 --> 01:05:22,905
The one with the long ears,
what are they?

1312
01:05:22,907 --> 01:05:24,139
Nubians.

1313
01:05:24,141 --> 01:05:25,475
Yes.

1314
01:05:25,477 --> 01:05:27,709
And that one over there
with the short ears?

1315
01:05:27,711 --> 01:05:28,911
Uh, Lamancha.

1316
01:05:28,913 --> 01:05:30,679
Lamancha.

1317
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:31,914
Yeah, got it.

1318
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:34,116
You got it.

1319
01:05:34,118 --> 01:05:36,952
- You're made for this.
- Um.

1320
01:05:36,954 --> 01:05:38,687
- It's fun, right?
- Yeah, no, it is fun.

1321
01:05:38,689 --> 01:05:40,456
It's just really messy work.

1322
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:44,226
Yeah, kind of uh, it reminds me
of when I was in LA,

1323
01:05:44,228 --> 01:05:46,895
I uh, I bussed tables for
a couple of years

1324
01:05:46,897 --> 01:05:49,932
and at the end
of every single shift,

1325
01:05:49,934 --> 01:05:52,000
I was a mess.

1326
01:05:52,002 --> 01:05:53,802
I had food all over me.

1327
01:05:53,804 --> 01:05:54,970
(Laughs)

1328
01:05:54,972 --> 01:05:56,171
How long did you live there?

1329
01:05:56,173 --> 01:05:59,409
Um, couple of years.

1330
01:05:59,411 --> 01:06:04,880
Uh, I was a singer,
uh singer-songwriter.

1331
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:05,847
What do you mean was?

1332
01:06:05,849 --> 01:06:07,849
You don't sing anymore?

1333
01:06:07,851 --> 01:06:08,984
No.

1334
01:06:08,986 --> 01:06:11,121
Um, not really.

1335
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:16,459
Um.

1336
01:06:16,461 --> 01:06:19,295
- I didn't make it, you know.
- Yeah.

1337
01:06:19,297 --> 01:06:23,966
And uh, my label dropped me.

1338
01:06:23,968 --> 01:06:28,870
And I had a very toxic
relationship with vodka.

1339
01:06:28,872 --> 01:06:33,175
And uh, everything
just kinda went sideways.

1340
01:06:33,177 --> 01:06:36,512
I... I lost myself.

1341
01:06:36,514 --> 01:06:37,779
(Smacks lips)

1342
01:06:37,781 --> 01:06:40,150
And the reason I went out there
in the first place...

1343
01:06:44,556 --> 01:06:46,788
...I went out there
to be somebody.

1344
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:50,526
And then, you know
I never thought I'd find myself

1345
01:06:50,528 --> 01:06:52,861
back here doing this.

1346
01:06:52,863 --> 01:06:54,297
(Chuckles)

1347
01:06:54,299 --> 01:06:57,734
Well, if it's any consolation
kind of the shiniest thing

1348
01:06:57,736 --> 01:07:01,304
in this town.

1349
01:07:01,306 --> 01:07:03,839
What do you plan to be
when you grow up, a farmer?

1350
01:07:03,841 --> 01:07:05,941
Oh gosh, I don't know
what I'm gonna be

1351
01:07:05,943 --> 01:07:08,043
when I grow up.

1352
01:07:08,045 --> 01:07:09,978
Kinda lost my compass.

1353
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,181
What's that mean?

1354
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:15,451
Something happened
with my husband

1355
01:07:15,453 --> 01:07:21,023
and I... I... I...
I just should've talked to him.

1356
01:07:21,025 --> 01:07:24,360
I mean the truth is
we were broke

1357
01:07:24,362 --> 01:07:26,194
and I don't know why
I just didn't talk to him.

1358
01:07:26,196 --> 01:07:30,566
And I just... so stupid.

1359
01:07:30,568 --> 01:07:32,702
I have an idea.

1360
01:07:32,704 --> 01:07:34,038
What are you doing tonight?

1361
01:07:37,174 --> 01:07:38,907
Come on, just because
you lose someone,

1362
01:07:38,909 --> 01:07:41,544
doesn't mean you stop
talking to 'em.

1363
01:07:41,546 --> 01:07:44,148
I come around here all the time
to talk to my grandmother.

1364
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,022
(Laughing)

1365
01:07:53,991 --> 01:07:56,858
This feels like a terrible idea.

1366
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,094
It's gonna be great, trust me.

1367
01:07:59,096 --> 01:08:04,101
(♪♪♪)

1368
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,308
(Taking deep breaths)

1369
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:13,942
(Laughs)

1370
01:08:13,944 --> 01:08:22,585
(♪♪♪)

1371
01:08:22,587 --> 01:08:25,087
This place is...

1372
01:08:25,089 --> 01:08:27,889
...it's so familiar to me.

1373
01:08:27,891 --> 01:08:30,259
Did there used to be
a driveway here?

1374
01:08:30,261 --> 01:08:33,262
Uh, I don't know.

1375
01:08:33,264 --> 01:08:34,930
It's where Jean grew up.

1376
01:08:34,932 --> 01:08:36,599
Nobody's lived in it for years.

1377
01:08:36,601 --> 01:08:39,935
Yeah, everyone calls it,
"the Halloween house".

1378
01:08:39,937 --> 01:08:42,037
SUNSHINE:
Come on.

1379
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:52,049
(♪♪♪)

1380
01:08:59,724 --> 01:09:01,189
(Laughs)

1381
01:09:01,191 --> 01:09:05,695
If you wanna lose your virginity
or talk to the dead,

1382
01:09:05,697 --> 01:09:07,399
this is the spot.

1383
01:09:14,739 --> 01:09:16,173
Come on.

1384
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:24,783
Okay, this is where we do it.

1385
01:09:26,518 --> 01:09:28,718
I really can't believe me that
you convinced me to do this,

1386
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:32,288
'cause I... I don't believe
in this sort of stuff.

1387
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:34,257
Close your eyes.

1388
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:36,224
And take a deep breath.

1389
01:09:36,226 --> 01:09:39,194
(Taking a deep breath)

1390
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:41,664
Together.

1391
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:42,532
(Inhales)

1392
01:09:42,534 --> 01:09:44,199
Deeper.

1393
01:09:44,201 --> 01:09:47,068
(Exhales)

1394
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:48,805
(Sighs)

1395
01:09:48,807 --> 01:09:52,240
We're uh, clearing the circle
to make space

1396
01:09:52,242 --> 01:09:53,609
for the other plane.

1397
01:09:53,611 --> 01:09:54,544
The what?

1398
01:09:54,546 --> 01:09:55,977
(Shushes)

1399
01:09:55,979 --> 01:09:57,112
Keep your eyes closed.

1400
01:09:57,114 --> 01:09:59,114
They are closed.

1401
01:09:59,116 --> 01:10:02,418
(Sighs)
Okay.

1402
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:03,820
Mmm.

1403
01:10:03,822 --> 01:10:05,254
(Takes a deep breath)

1404
01:10:05,256 --> 01:10:10,393
We hope so we will receive
a sign of your presence.

1405
01:10:10,395 --> 01:10:18,801
Danny, if you're with us, please
join us when you're ready.

1406
01:10:18,803 --> 01:10:20,803
How do we see a sign
if our eyes are closed?

1407
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:22,505
(Sighs)

1408
01:10:22,507 --> 01:10:24,841
I feel like you're not taking
this seriously.

1409
01:10:24,843 --> 01:10:26,876
Sorry.

1410
01:10:26,878 --> 01:10:28,413
(Sunshine takes a deep breath)

1411
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:32,415
Can I give it a shot?

1412
01:10:32,417 --> 01:10:36,285
Yeah, sure, be my guest.

1413
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:45,261
Um, Danny, you can hear me?

1414
01:10:45,263 --> 01:10:46,831
I miss you.

1415
01:10:49,834 --> 01:10:51,032
(Chuckles)

1416
01:10:51,034 --> 01:10:52,904
I really miss you.

1417
01:10:59,042 --> 01:11:02,010
Why didn't I talk to you?

1418
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:06,047
Why couldn't we just see that
we had enough, you were enough.

1419
01:11:06,049 --> 01:11:08,253
We didn't need more.

1420
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:16,861
Why am I so mad at you for dying
and leaving us?

1421
01:11:21,866 --> 01:11:24,032
You know, I mean I was the one
that asked you to take Abby

1422
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:27,539
to school that day, I was
the one who changed the routine.

1423
01:11:30,308 --> 01:11:36,445
And I just feel like
it was my fault.

1424
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,213
And I'm really sorry.

1425
01:11:38,215 --> 01:11:39,717
I'm really...

1426
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:43,819
...sorry.

1427
01:11:43,821 --> 01:11:46,724
(Fire crackling)

1428
01:11:49,394 --> 01:11:52,261
And I love you.

1429
01:11:52,263 --> 01:11:54,530
And the kids love you.

1430
01:11:54,532 --> 01:12:00,738
And I don't know what else
to say.

1431
01:12:06,411 --> 01:12:08,813
I just hope that you're okay
wherever you are.

1432
01:12:16,086 --> 01:12:22,190
I don't think that
really worked.

1433
01:12:22,192 --> 01:12:24,562
You did great.

1434
01:12:28,131 --> 01:12:31,132
You nailed it!

1435
01:12:31,134 --> 01:12:34,403

1438

Don't make me one,
I'm not eating bread.

1439
01:13:03,267 --> 01:13:04,934
Hmm.

1440
01:13:04,936 --> 01:13:07,235
Jean, why didn't you tell me
about that house?

1441
01:13:07,237 --> 01:13:09,672
It's amazing,
it can be so beautiful.

1442
01:13:09,674 --> 01:13:11,139
- You went up there?
- LIBBY: Mhmm.

1443
01:13:11,141 --> 01:13:13,042
Last night with Sunshine.

1444
01:13:13,044 --> 01:13:14,175
It was crazy.

1445
01:13:14,177 --> 01:13:20,049
She convinced me to do
like a circle thing with candles

1446
01:13:20,051 --> 01:13:22,852
- and... and...
- A séance?

1447
01:13:22,854 --> 01:13:23,953
Yeah.

1448
01:13:23,955 --> 01:13:25,388
I don't know, it...

1449
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:27,256
Did it work?

1450
01:13:27,258 --> 01:13:31,327
(Sighs)

1451
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:34,563
I feel better.

1452
01:13:34,565 --> 01:13:36,699
Why'd you let that house go?

1453
01:13:36,701 --> 01:13:38,768
Must've been a great place
to grow up.

1454
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:41,737
I really want that
for Abby and Tank.

1455
01:13:41,739 --> 01:13:44,373
Abbs, Tank, come on, let's go!

1456
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:45,975
- We're gonna be late!
- ABBY: Coming!

1457
01:13:45,977 --> 01:13:49,679
You know, like a home, like a...
like a real home.

1458
01:13:49,681 --> 01:13:53,983
You know, with Marsha
we just moved from town to town

1459
01:13:53,985 --> 01:13:55,785
and husband to husband.

1460
01:13:55,787 --> 01:13:59,088
And just never got to lay
any roots.

1461
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:01,557
I don't wanna end up like that.

1462
01:14:01,559 --> 01:14:05,061
Well, well, well,
look what the cat dragged in.

1463
01:14:05,063 --> 01:14:07,228
- Go.
- Jeanie, Jeanie.

1464
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:08,297
- Mornin'.
- Hi honey.

1465
01:14:08,299 --> 01:14:10,266
Abby says there's dancing
at the party.

1466
01:14:10,268 --> 01:14:11,167
I don't know how, Jeanie.

1467
01:14:11,169 --> 01:14:12,535
It's easy.

1468
01:14:12,537 --> 01:14:14,570
Come on, now just fake it.

1469
01:14:14,572 --> 01:14:16,505
Is O'Connor coming
to the dance party?

1470
01:14:16,507 --> 01:14:17,473
Fingers crossed.

1471
01:14:17,475 --> 01:14:18,774
Jeanie.

1472
01:14:18,776 --> 01:14:20,810
Oh what?

1473
01:14:20,812 --> 01:14:22,678
Why yes, of course,
I want a present.

1474
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,280
It's my birthday
for goodness sake.

1475
01:14:24,282 --> 01:14:29,151
But I have one rule, no one is
allowed to buy me a present.

1476
01:14:29,153 --> 01:14:30,419
We have to steal them?

1477
01:14:30,421 --> 01:14:31,721
- No!
- (Laughing)

1478
01:14:31,723 --> 01:14:32,888
What are you talking about?

1479
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:35,991
- No, you make them, silly.
- You're crazy.

1480
01:14:35,993 --> 01:14:38,160
Look at your face, steal.

1481
01:14:38,162 --> 01:14:39,495
- Bye, Aunt Jean.
- JEAN: Bye.

1482
01:14:39,497 --> 01:14:43,299
- TANK: Bye, Aunt Jeanie.
- JEAN: Bye.

1483
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:44,800
Libby.

1484
01:14:44,802 --> 01:14:45,870
Yes, ma'am.

1485
01:14:47,572 --> 01:14:50,139
You're not your mother.

1486
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:51,709

Hey.

1492
01:15:23,975 --> 01:15:27,143
Hey, Libby.

1493
01:15:27,145 --> 01:15:28,310
You look tired.

1494
01:15:28,312 --> 01:15:30,913
Oh, thank you.

1495
01:15:30,915 --> 01:15:32,348
How do you feel?

1496
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:33,382
Tired.

1499
01:15:36,654 --> 01:15:40,189
Um, well, you know,
considering the circumstances,

1500
01:15:40,191 --> 01:15:43,359
she's managing.

1501
01:15:43,361 --> 01:15:45,096
Something's gotta give.

1502
01:15:46,597 --> 01:15:47,897
I'm sorry, it's tough.

1503
01:15:47,899 --> 01:15:50,232
No.

1504
01:15:50,234 --> 01:15:52,168
We're gonna see ya
at Jean's party this weekend,

1505
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:53,402
right?

1506
01:15:53,404 --> 01:15:57,306
Yeah, I don't... I don't know
if I feel much like a party.

1507
01:15:57,308 --> 01:15:58,207
That makes sense.

1508
01:15:58,209 --> 01:15:59,811
Right, you know.

1509
01:16:04,515 --> 01:16:06,249
- It was nice seeing you.
- You, too.

1510
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:07,718
- LIBBY: Feel better.
- Hmm.

1511
01:16:10,221 --> 01:16:11,520
Hey, Libby.

1512
01:16:11,522 --> 01:16:13,256
Yeah?

1513
01:16:13,258 --> 01:16:16,759
The farm looks terrible.

1514
01:16:16,761 --> 01:16:18,360
I had a terrible teacher.

1515
01:16:18,362 --> 01:16:19,564
(James laughs)

1516
01:16:22,466 --> 01:16:24,867
Libby, the school called,
Abby's been hurt.

1517
01:16:24,869 --> 01:16:26,068
What?

1518
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:27,069
I'll drive.

- You okay?
- Yeah.

1521
01:16:43,288 --> 01:16:44,453
The head always bleeds a lot,

1522
01:16:44,455 --> 01:16:46,388
so that's why her clothes
are so bloody.

1523
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:47,489
The wound's superficial.

1524
01:16:47,491 --> 01:16:50,125
Yeah, it doesn't look
superficial to me.

1525
01:16:50,127 --> 01:16:51,460
Bug, what happened?

1526
01:16:51,462 --> 01:16:52,895
You can tell me.

1527
01:16:52,897 --> 01:16:56,031
Jimmy Grevoski pushed me
into the fence.

1528
01:16:56,033 --> 01:16:57,466
So that kid
is still bothering you?

1529
01:16:57,468 --> 01:16:58,434
Yes.

1530
01:16:58,436 --> 01:17:00,603
I used my words
and he pushed me.

1531
01:17:00,605 --> 01:17:03,273
Unfortunately, it wasn't
the best choice of words.

1532
01:17:03,275 --> 01:17:05,308
Well, what words did you use?

1533
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:07,009
I told him to back the eff off.

1534
01:17:07,011 --> 01:17:09,078
(Laughing)

1535
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,846
That's great.

1536
01:17:10,848 --> 01:17:14,116
Mrs. Moran, can I speak to you
in my office?

1537
01:17:14,118 --> 01:17:16,654
Uh, sure.

1538
01:17:22,827 --> 01:17:23,893
- Thanks.
- What?

1539
01:17:23,895 --> 01:17:25,830
- I didn't do...
- That was nice, thanks.

1540
01:17:29,767 --> 01:17:32,701
(Chuckles)
You said that?

1541
01:17:32,703 --> 01:17:35,372
NURSE:
You're gonna be okay.

1542
01:17:35,374 --> 01:17:37,673
I believe we're looking
at another suspension.

1543
01:17:37,675 --> 01:17:40,509
You gotta be kidding me,
for saying a bad word?

1544
01:17:40,511 --> 01:17:42,912
That kid pushed her
and she's bleeding.

1545
01:17:42,914 --> 01:17:44,513
Jimmy is also going to receive
a suspension.

1546
01:17:44,515 --> 01:17:45,447
Unbelievable.

1547
01:17:45,449 --> 01:17:47,750
You know what?

1548
01:17:47,752 --> 01:17:50,953
I don't think
you are doing your job.

1549
01:17:50,955 --> 01:17:53,756
My child is supposed to be safe
at school,

1550
01:17:53,758 --> 01:17:56,191
she used her words
just like you said

1551
01:17:56,193 --> 01:17:59,929
and now you're going to suspend
her again for saying a bad word.

1552
01:17:59,931 --> 01:18:01,364
What kind of a school
are you running?

1553
01:18:01,366 --> 01:18:04,600
She's being bullied daily
and you have done nothing

1554
01:18:04,602 --> 01:18:05,901
to stop it.

1555
01:18:05,903 --> 01:18:08,037
Mrs. Moran,
we have a system in place.

1556
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:12,074
Well, Mrs. Weeks,
your system is broken.

1557
01:18:12,076 --> 01:18:13,175
Yeah.

1558
01:18:13,177 --> 01:18:15,314
I'm gonna get that blood
wiped off you.

1559
01:18:18,215 --> 01:18:19,548

What is this?

Are you and Frank my parents?

No.

That's not it.

Then what?

Why do I know that house?

1813

I think we better go sit down.

1814
01:34:51,343 --> 01:34:54,076
The reason that house
seems familiar to you

1815
01:34:54,078 --> 01:34:57,980
is because you grew up in it
till you were 4.

1816
01:34:57,982 --> 01:34:59,548
Marsha lived in that house?

1817
01:34:59,550 --> 01:35:01,251
No.

1818
01:35:01,253 --> 01:35:03,353
Just you.

1819
01:35:03,355 --> 01:35:05,888
But where was my mother?

1820
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:10,626
You lived with Mama and Papa
till you were 2 months old.

1821
01:35:10,628 --> 01:35:12,895
Frank and I came up,
because Mama got sick.

1822
01:35:12,897 --> 01:35:13,896
But where was my mother?

1823
01:35:13,898 --> 01:35:16,598
You were like a gift.

1824
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,401
You were the baby that
I couldn't have.

1825
01:35:18,403 --> 01:35:20,869
Where was my mother?

1826
01:35:20,871 --> 01:35:24,907
She left you, honey.

1827
01:35:24,909 --> 01:35:26,608
She left you with us,
but it was alright,

1828
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:27,710
because we were a family.

1829
01:35:27,712 --> 01:35:28,610
No, no, no.

01:35:28,612 --> 01:35:29,847

Why don't I remember that?

(Taking deep breaths)

1835
01:35:38,423 --> 01:35:39,922
But she came back for me?

1836
01:35:39,924 --> 01:35:42,258
She did come back.

1837
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:45,261
Mama died
and she came to the service.

1838
01:35:45,263 --> 01:35:49,865
She saw how happy we were
and she wanted you back.

1839
01:35:49,867 --> 01:35:54,371
She left me for four years
and you let her

1840
01:35:54,373 --> 01:35:55,571
come in and take me?

1841
01:35:55,573 --> 01:35:58,540
There was nothing I could do
to stop her from taking you.

1842
01:35:58,542 --> 01:35:59,775
You should've tried harder.

1843
01:35:59,777 --> 01:36:01,810
You're right, I should've
told 'em she was crazy.

1844
01:36:01,812 --> 01:36:02,811
I should've lied.

1845
01:36:02,813 --> 01:36:05,281
I should've fought harder
for you.

1846
01:36:05,283 --> 01:36:08,751
But she was your mother,
there was nothing we could do.

1847
01:36:08,753 --> 01:36:12,821
You've known this
this whole time.

1848
01:36:12,823 --> 01:36:14,823

After your Grandpa died,
your mom wanted to sell

that house.

1853
01:36:35,579 --> 01:36:38,614
All of my good memories
are in it.

1854
01:36:38,616 --> 01:36:41,817
And for a long time I was hoping
you'd come home again.

1855
01:36:41,819 --> 01:36:44,620
Is that supposed to make me
feel better, Jean?

1856
01:36:44,622 --> 01:36:46,090
Hmm?

1857

He's in the energy business

1868
01:38:03,868 --> 01:38:07,803
and I met him
at the downtown club happy hour.

1869
01:38:07,805 --> 01:38:09,372
That sounds promising.

1870
01:38:09,374 --> 01:38:12,074
Maybe, we'll see.

I guess it feels good
to finally know why

1872
01:38:16,548 --> 01:38:21,717
there weren't any baby photos
of me growing up.

1873
01:38:21,719 --> 01:38:25,154
I used to think it was,
because I wasn't pretty enough

1874
01:38:25,156 --> 01:38:27,156
or my clothes weren't right.

1875
01:38:27,158 --> 01:38:29,359
Alright, well, she told you.

1876
01:38:29,361 --> 01:38:30,426
Yeah, she told me.

1877
01:38:30,428 --> 01:38:31,528
And now you're mad at me.

...mad at you.

1882
01:38:38,336 --> 01:38:40,303
Well, good, you shouldn't be,
because I was a child

with a child.

1884
01:38:42,006 --> 01:38:44,072
And anybody who knew me at 18,

1885
01:38:44,074 --> 01:38:49,178
knew that I was in no way ready
to raise a baby.

1886

This isn't about Jean,
this is about you and me

and the fact that
you didn't want me.

1893
01:39:06,464 --> 01:39:07,463
That's not true.

'cause I did the right thing.
