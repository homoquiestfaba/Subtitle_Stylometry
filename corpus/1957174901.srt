00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:43,775
It's a mine field!

183
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,745
What the hell are we
Doin' in a mine field?!

184
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:48,113
We've got no choice!

185
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:50,215
Stand and fight!

186
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:52,317
Maybe we should take
A vote on this one,

187
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:52,384
Captain.

188
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,718
No!

189
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:56,354
Captain?

190
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:07,331
How well do you
Know this area?

191
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:08,666
It's a mine field!

192
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:11,002
That's not what i asked.
You scouted it, right?

193
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:12,203
If you are asking

194
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:14,038
If i know
Where the mines are,

195
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:16,675
Sort of,
But not at night.

196
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:19,677
Get out.

197
00:16:19,744 --> 00:16:21,146
What?

198
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,982
Get out.
Into the cage!

199
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:25,983
Come on!

200
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,285
Hurry up, youssef.

201
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:30,689
Allah
Be merciful.

202
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:45,403
Go.

203
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:05,656
Youssef: wait!

204
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:07,158
Hit the brake!

205
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:08,526
Wait!

206
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:12,464
I must walk...

207
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,600
Where i can
Feel my way.

208
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,023
[explosion]

209
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:40,492
Nichols: they're
Getting closer, sir.

210
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,514
Ah--ah!

211
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:35,647
Wellford:
Youssef, hurry!

212
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,994
Youssef!
It's too dangerous.

213
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,629
Get back in the jeep!
Come on!

214
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:06,177
Ok. It's about 100 feet
To the finish line.

215
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:08,646
Punch it, nichols.

216
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:10,681
Say again, sir?

217
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:12,416
Come on, let's go!

218
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:15,286
Morton: come on, bro!
You been there before!

219
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:53,324
Morton: whoo!

220
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:54,325
Saaid.

221
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:18,983
Is he ok?

222
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:21,018
It's just
A surface wound,

223
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:22,687
But i'll monitor it.

224
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,659
How's that radio?

225
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,267
Everyone else
All right?

226
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:39,571
I prefer
The camel.

227
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:41,305
I'm sure you do.

228
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,307
[laughs]

229
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:44,675
You son
Of a bitch!

230
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:48,179
Aah! Aah!

231
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:51,182
Why don't you just
Line us up and shoot us?!

232
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:52,950
The day's young,
Sergeant.

233
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:54,853
Aah!

234
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,522
We coulda died
Back there!

235
00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:58,723
But you didn't.

236
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,359
Tell that to the guys
You lost in the second jeep!

237
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:02,827
They were hit
By mortar fire.

238
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,163
Even if they were
Armed to the hilt,

239
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:06,698
It wouldn't
Have mattered.

240
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,570
It matters to me.

241
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:18,308
What now, captain?

242
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,978
We've detoured,

243
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:21,746
But we push on.

244
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:26,050
Sir?

245
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:28,352
After all this,
Do you really believe

246
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:30,655
We're gonna find those
Poor bastards alive?

247
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:34,392
After all this,

248
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,694
I really believe
We should try.

249
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,627
Youssef:
Go left, captain.

250
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:12,063
Left, left, left.

251
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,439
Erickson: what is it?

252
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:25,142
This route,
It takes us too far south.

253
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:27,144
Any ideas?

254
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:30,314
We can cut through
The city of aramis.

255
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:32,049
I don't see
Any city.

256
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:34,151
Youssef:
Not on the map,

257
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:38,556
But it is very,
Very old city.

258
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:42,460
It's a ruins,
Long abandoned.

259
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,395
But don't worry,
Captain.

260
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:45,997
If i scale
The canyon,

261
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:47,999
 I can find
 The path.

262
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,267
Don't worry.

263
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,635
Stop here.

264
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:56,708
Nichols: what do
You think, captain?

265
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:07,051
Ok, nichols.
Shut her down.

266
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,659
Morton: get down!

267
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:24,102
Go! Back it up!
Back it up!

268
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:36,314
Go! Go! Go!
Back! Back!

269
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,689
Back up! Back!

270
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,602
Morton:
They're everywhere!

271
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:11,416
Go! Go! Go! Go!

272
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:20,024
Go!

273
00:24:21,258 --> 00:24:22,393
Incoming!

274
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,498
Aaah!

275
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:29,967
Nichols: they're hit,
Captain, they're hit!

276
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:39,711
[all shouting]

277
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:47,351
Go!

278
00:24:47,418 --> 00:24:49,119
Morton: incoming!

279
00:24:49,186 --> 00:24:50,288
Nichols:
We're boxed in, sir!

280
00:24:57,761 --> 00:25:00,198
Nichols:
I'm out! I'm out!

281
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:02,767
Punch it! Go!

282
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:07,004
I don't think
We're gonna make it!

283
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:20,985
This is never
Gonna work!

284
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,489
Aaah!

285
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:30,994
Morton: whoo!

286
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:34,632
 Whoo-hoo-hoo!

287
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,101
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

288
00:25:57,587 --> 00:25:59,724
Sergeant.
Stop, stop.

289
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:02,659
There.

290
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:05,329
Aramis.

291
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:09,066
It is a secret
Holy city.

292
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:11,202
A perfect place
To hide out.

293
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:18,075
I didn't join up to hide out
In some dead city.

294
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:19,476
You didn't join up.

295
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:21,946
You're here because your own
Army couldn't control you.

296
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:25,215
Learn from it,
Sergeant.

297
00:26:25,282 --> 00:26:26,484
Let's go.

298
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,175
I don't get it.

299
00:26:52,242 --> 00:26:54,177
Why would they ambush us?

300
00:26:54,244 --> 00:26:56,647
Maybe we were
Nearing a test site.

301
00:26:56,714 --> 00:26:58,849
Which means we
Could be sitting

302
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:00,717
At ground zero.

303
00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:01,986
Unarmed.

304
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:03,621
Nicholas: kinda
Makes you want to check

305
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:05,455
That expiration date
Stamped on your ass, huh?

306
00:27:05,522 --> 00:27:06,791
This should
Increase your confidence

307
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:08,025
In your shelf-life a bit.

308
00:27:17,668 --> 00:27:19,003
One clip?

309
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,971
We're under strict orders
Not to engage.

310
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,107
This is still a recon
And rescue operation.

311
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:26,644
What do you think this is,
Some kind of game?

312
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,681
Hey, come on, bro.
Sergeant morton with one clip?

313
00:27:30,748 --> 00:27:32,650
Armies have surrendered
For less.

314
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:38,856
Guess i have done
A little damage in my day.

315
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:42,593
That's precisely why
You'll only fire on my orders.

316
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:55,506
He is a wild child,
Captain,

317
00:27:55,572 --> 00:27:57,074
But believe me,

318
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,443
When it's time
To rock 'n' roll...

319
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:02,179
There's nobody you want
More on your team.

320
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:06,750
I've had a gut full
Of rock 'n' roll...

321
00:28:06,817 --> 00:28:08,753
A lifetime's worth.

322
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,931
I should probably
Go check on him.

323
00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:54,732
Youssef.

324
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,168
Scout anything?

325
00:28:58,235 --> 00:29:00,638
We're alone.

326
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:03,174
This is a land of ghosts.

327
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:06,376
Mmm?

328
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:07,378
No.

329
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:13,150
The days
Are no different.

330
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:16,286
The world turns.

331
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:21,092
The men chase mad dreams
Across its space.

332
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:24,128
 The view
 Is always the same.

333
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:29,634
You're strange.

334
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,146

[erickson
And wellford laugh]

337
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:02,666
Sounds like the captain's
Gettin' some.

338
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:03,700
Aw, man.

339
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,068
[erickson laughs]

340
00:30:05,135 --> 00:30:06,970
Come trouble tomorrow,
We'll be gettin' ours.

341
00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:09,973
Yeah, well, i wish i was
Gettin' mine right now.

342

Of ghosts, huh?

Wellford:
How the bloody hell

347
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,070
Did they slip
Past you, youssef?

348
00:30:40,137 --> 00:30:43,374
Puma has given them
The footsteps of a cat.

349
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,542
That's the biggest
Pile of bullshit

350
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:46,677
As i've ever heard.

351
00:30:49,746 --> 00:30:52,049
Look out for cats
Next time, all right?

Native language]

365
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,667
[hammer banging]

366
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:13,978
[hammer banging]

367
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:26,656
That one.

368
00:35:26,723 --> 00:35:29,626
She will die of fright
At your first satisfaction.

369
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:32,029
Ivan is waiting.

370
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,632
Ivan:
And welcome as ever.

371
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,336
I prosper
With each visit.

372
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:44,307
Tell me, loyal friend.

373
00:35:44,374 --> 00:35:46,343
What do you have
For me today?

374
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:51,714
Oh, allow me
To introduce

375
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:55,185
Chief customs
Director abu nimer,

376
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,487
A loyal
And devoted servant

377
00:35:57,553 --> 00:35:59,823
Of his native
Ayazad, and yet

378
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,659
A man still
Sensitive enough

379
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:04,695
To understand
The special needs

380
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,263
Of small
Businessmen.

381
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,368
Speak.

382
00:36:12,435 --> 00:36:14,638
A second
Ipf convoy.

383
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:19,643
Jabbar has taken steps.

384
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:24,415
2 attempts,
2 failures.

385
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:29,686
If jabbar cannot destroy
A peace-keeping convoy,

386
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:33,056
He must surely fail
In his main objective.

387
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:35,525
Besides, it is
No concern of mine.

388
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:39,029
I am but a humble
Businessman.

389
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,664
I supply the wood
And the nails.

390
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:43,700
It is for jabbar
To build the coffins.

391
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:45,069
[laughs]

392
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:50,374
Will you dine?

393
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,878
Uh, my unexplained absence
May arouse suspicion.

394
00:36:54,944 --> 00:36:57,180
It is, perhaps, imprudent,

395
00:36:57,246 --> 00:37:00,984
Given the delicacy
Of our relationship.

396
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:04,221
Then let's do business...

397
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:07,390
Before this tender toe

398
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:11,261
Dries out
Beneath my desert sun.

399
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:16,500
Ah. Well,
Khalu jabbar.

400
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:18,034
What a pleasure.

401
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:20,637
Tell me, will you
Dine with me,

402
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:22,939
Or a drink, perhaps?

403
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:24,341
 Oh, oh.

404
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:26,610
Oh.

405
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:32,682
Forgive my cultural
Insensitivities.

406
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:36,687
Alcohol in paradise,
Perhaps.

407
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:44,227
What is he doing here?
My government

408
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:48,065
Does not recognize
Or sanction this colonel.

409
00:37:48,131 --> 00:37:51,301
Take care for the way
You use my rank.

410
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:54,404
It is earned each day.

411
00:37:54,471 --> 00:37:58,375
He is a renegade,
A brigand.

412
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:00,110
Gentlemen,
Let's put aside

413
00:38:00,176 --> 00:38:01,678
These ideological
Differences

414
00:38:01,745 --> 00:38:03,180
And discuss
Business.

415
00:38:06,783 --> 00:38:09,386
And what is our business
This time?

416
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,055
Surely the colonel
Has guns and bullets enough

417
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:16,092
To satisfy even
His appetite for slaughter.

418
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:18,128
You are
A perceptive man.

419
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,397
How would you like
To be a rich one?

420
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:24,767
How rich?

421
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:27,538
Delightfully.

422
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,241
Now, the device

423
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:33,276
Will come across
The caspian sea

424
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:34,778
From
Turkmenistan.

425
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,615
The device
From turkmenistan...

426
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:54,197
Sounds more dangerous
Than profitable.

427
00:38:54,263 --> 00:38:58,068
Sharp as the blade
Of muhammad.

428
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:04,373
For him?

429
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,378
The republic of ayazad
Cannot be implicated

430
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:11,514
In the smuggling
Of a nuclear device.

431
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:15,685
But the wrong element
Like this?

432
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:19,288
Our goals are the same.

433
00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:23,327
Ayazad will again
Have dominance and glory

434
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:26,696
Before the bhandari
Blasphemers.

435
00:39:26,763 --> 00:39:31,167
I, uh, i don't know
About this.

436
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:33,703
My dear director,

437
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,406
You are far
Too intelligent a man

438
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:38,241
To be confined
And shackled

439
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:40,376
To a bureaucratic post.

440
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:43,046
You must
Open your mind

441
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:45,915
To the greater
Possibilities of life.

442
00:39:45,982 --> 00:39:49,352
There are many factors
To consider.

443
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:52,155
Allow me to add
Another factor. Sonya.

444
00:39:57,093 --> 00:39:59,997
10% down payment.

445
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:02,666
10%.

446
00:40:05,435 --> 00:40:08,471
[chuckles]
As i said,

447
00:40:08,538 --> 00:40:10,974
Delightfully rich.

448
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,610
Now, this
Initial payment

449
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:16,446
Will be in your
Hands just as soon

450
00:40:16,513 --> 00:40:17,647
As the full
Documentation

451
00:40:17,714 --> 00:40:19,182
Is in ours.

452
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:27,924
As long as we
Understand each other.

453
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:32,529
I guarantee entry,
Not safe passage.

454
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,665
Either way,
I get my money.

455
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:43,306
And now, if you
Would be good enough

456
00:40:43,372 --> 00:40:45,608
To have someone
Return me to the city.

457
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:48,745
Of course.
Of course.

458
00:40:50,713 --> 00:40:52,649
Travel safely,
My good friend.

459
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:54,117
Thank you.

460
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:19,675
Tell me. This insect...

461
00:41:19,742 --> 00:41:21,511
Can he be trusted?

462
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:27,184
It is not his loyalty
I count on.

463
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:28,644
Youssef?

464
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:32,715
Nomads.
Displaced tribesmen,

465
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:33,783
Or, uh--

466
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:38,221
Another welcome wagon
Courtesy of jabbar?

467
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:41,758
Perhaps, for once,
He might just surprise me.

468
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:48,365
[men shouting
In native language]

469
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:01,644
Wellford: easy, guys.

470
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:04,948
Come on.
Let's go earn our pay.

471
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:07,050
[men shouting
In native language]

472
00:43:07,116 --> 00:43:09,752
Stand down,
Sergeants.

473
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:11,721
Damn.

474
00:43:11,788 --> 00:43:13,156
All right,
Let's go.

475
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:17,594
No. We're not here
To fight.

476
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,196
Yeah, don't tell us,
Tell them!

477
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:21,697
Mark your target.

478
00:43:21,764 --> 00:43:23,532
I'm still in command
Of this truck!

479
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,235
Yeah? We started with 3!

480
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:26,236
James.

481
00:43:28,537 --> 00:43:29,639
[all shouting
In native language]

482
00:43:30,974 --> 00:43:35,244
I'm not goin' home
In a box! Not for you.

483
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:37,414
Captain.

484
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:51,328
No!

485
00:43:52,729 --> 00:43:53,663
[man screams]

486
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,510

[shouting
In native language]

492
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:09,506
She ask, "why is
My husband dead?"

493
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:13,776
"we need food,
Medicine."

494
00:45:13,843 --> 00:45:18,581
"the fever sweeps
For the children."

495
00:45:18,648 --> 00:45:20,583
[woman cries out
In native language]

496
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,718
"you're not here
To help?"

[man chanting]

499
00:45:46,242 --> 00:45:48,677
Beautiful.

500
00:45:48,744 --> 00:45:50,613
Huh?

501
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,550
Now, you come for an
Instrument of justice.

502
00:45:54,617 --> 00:45:58,989
Precise, compact,
And remorseless.

503
00:46:00,689 --> 00:46:03,360
Like the young master
Himself.

504
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:26,048
I offer this moron

505
00:46:26,115 --> 00:46:27,650
A path
Of glorious vengeance

506
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:29,318
Against mighty enemies,

507
00:46:29,385 --> 00:46:33,956
And he insults me
With trinkets.

508
00:46:34,023 --> 00:46:36,959
You must have 2 times
This and a bit more,

509
00:46:37,026 --> 00:46:38,395
Then it is yours.

510
00:46:51,207 --> 00:46:53,643
We will find a way
To guide the aim

511
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:57,280
Of the small warrior.

512
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,115

[shouting
In native language]

519
00:49:51,187 --> 00:49:53,956
I have the preliminary
Documentation

520
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:55,991
And the authenticator
And sequencing codes

521
00:49:56,058 --> 00:49:58,661
So important
To your colonel jabbar.

522
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,965
The money first.

523
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:42,772
When?

524
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:46,042
Not until i see
The rest of my money.

525
00:50:46,108 --> 00:50:48,577
In any event,
I will not be able

526
00:50:48,644 --> 00:50:51,380
To take possession of the device
Until the customs office opens

527
00:50:51,446 --> 00:50:54,350
Tomorrow morning at 5:00.

Our customs director
Abu nimer.

[speaking
Native language]

534
00:52:39,255 --> 00:52:41,524
Please be seated.

535
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,368
You know who i am?

536
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,106
Al-alyaman,

537
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:00,209
Minister of defense
Of bhandar.

538
00:53:01,677 --> 00:53:04,680
So you know
It is worth my life

539
00:53:04,747 --> 00:53:08,051
To be discovered here
Up on ayazad soil.

540
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:11,654
Yes.

541
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:18,327
General fayad has briefed me
Regarding your communication

542
00:53:18,394 --> 00:53:20,395
Of an offer to re-route

543
00:53:20,462 --> 00:53:23,332
An illicit device
Bound for your country.

544
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:28,136
This venture
Was outside the range

545
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:30,973
Of your legitimate authority.

546
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:36,478
Hence, it is of some interest
To my country

547
00:53:36,545 --> 00:53:39,515
To know the identity
Of your master.

548
00:53:43,218 --> 00:53:47,990
My client is
Colonel khalu jabbar.

549
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,828
You suspect duplicity
From jabbar

550
00:53:52,895 --> 00:53:56,332
Regarding your transaction?

551
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,502
Is this why you seek
A second benefactor?

552
00:54:04,306 --> 00:54:07,043
Not particularly.

553
00:54:08,177 --> 00:54:13,449
Mmm. The duplicity
Begins with you.

554
00:54:13,515 --> 00:54:18,320
So, what would you
Ask of us, peddler?

555
00:54:18,386 --> 00:54:20,789
Simple acknowledgment

556
00:54:20,856 --> 00:54:24,727
Of this humanitarian mission
For world peace on my part

557
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:28,630
And whatever
Financial considerations

558
00:54:28,697 --> 00:54:31,500
Such a selfless act
Might engender

559
00:54:31,566 --> 00:54:35,171
From the grateful people
Of bhandar, of course.

560
00:54:37,706 --> 00:54:41,177
You would betray
Your country for money?

561
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:49,652
You control
The device now?

562
00:54:51,153 --> 00:54:52,921
I do.

563
00:54:52,988 --> 00:54:56,659
Triple your present
Arrangements with jabbar,

564
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,727
And, uh...

565
00:54:58,794 --> 00:55:02,231
Safe passage to
The nation of your choice.

566
00:55:03,966 --> 00:55:06,202
Done and done.

567
00:55:07,736 --> 00:55:09,705
Uh...

568
00:55:09,772 --> 00:55:12,108
May i leave now?

569
00:55:12,174 --> 00:55:14,343
Please do.

570
00:55:16,745 --> 00:55:18,347
And, uh...

571
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:20,650
They took my...

572
00:55:20,716 --> 00:55:22,451
Do not worry.

573
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:32,494
But barring admonishment,
Director abu nimer,

574
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:36,198
Do not confuse me
With your rabid dog jabbar.

575
00:55:36,265 --> 00:55:40,469
 I will have this device
 Within 24 hours...

576
00:55:40,535 --> 00:55:42,838
Or i will have your head.

577
00:55:45,173 --> 00:55:46,108
[door closes]

578
00:57:33,582 --> 00:57:34,784
[sighs]

579
00:58:27,269 --> 00:58:28,304
[gasps]

580
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:30,806
[choking]

581
00:58:30,872 --> 00:58:33,175
[neck breaking]

582
00:58:47,455 --> 00:58:48,858
[banging]

583
00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:36,338
Wellford: dead end.

584
00:59:39,908 --> 00:59:41,843
I am sorry, captain.

585
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:44,179
You're right.

586
00:59:44,245 --> 00:59:45,547
It's a dead end.

587
00:59:45,613 --> 00:59:47,650
We'll just get a map

588
00:59:47,716 --> 00:59:48,818
And find a way down.

589
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:04,700
It wasn't
Your fault.

590
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:06,868
Yeah, you're
Bloody right it wasn't.

591
01:00:06,935 --> 01:00:08,737
He's supposed to know
The desert like the--

592
01:00:08,804 --> 01:00:09,872
Stop it.

593
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,239
What?

594
01:00:11,306 --> 01:00:12,541
You gave them
The weapon,

595
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:14,609
So now it's all on you.
Is that it?

596
01:00:14,676 --> 01:00:15,711
[sighs]

597
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,745
I made a mistake,

598
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:18,380
And a man's dead
Because of it.

599
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:19,715
No. You made
A decision.

600
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,716
Sergeant morton
Made the mistake.

601
01:00:21,783 --> 01:00:23,652
Yeah...

602
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:25,687
But it happened
On my watch.

603
01:00:25,754 --> 01:00:28,691
Captain, captain?

604
01:00:28,757 --> 01:00:29,858
Please, please.

605
01:00:29,925 --> 01:00:31,227
Please!

606
01:00:34,963 --> 01:00:36,232
[sighs]

607
01:00:46,608 --> 01:00:48,243
[sighs]

608
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:51,580
You took it away.

609
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:53,749
Just got a little
Heavy for him.

610
01:01:00,522 --> 01:01:02,992
Perhaps it's a miracle.

611
01:01:10,032 --> 01:01:12,001
Well, it's about time.

612
01:01:27,282 --> 01:01:29,451
Nichols: so much for
The engine trouble theory.

613
01:01:39,394 --> 01:01:40,629
Youssef.

614
01:01:42,864 --> 01:01:44,566
What do you make
Of this?

615
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:46,368
Bhandar nationals

616
01:01:46,435 --> 01:01:47,603
Without question.

617
01:01:47,669 --> 01:01:49,638
Bhandaras?

618
01:01:49,704 --> 01:01:52,440
Now what would they
Be doing in ayazad?

619
01:01:52,507 --> 01:01:54,443
And why ambush
A peace-keeping patrol?

620
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:57,346
It is
A show of force.

621
01:01:57,412 --> 01:02:00,315
They hungry for war.

622
01:02:00,382 --> 01:02:02,417
From what i've seen,
Both countries share

623
01:02:02,484 --> 01:02:03,885
In that appetite.

624
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:06,821
They are the enemies
Of my people.

625
01:02:06,888 --> 01:02:08,757
People of ayazad.

626
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:10,425
I do not pretend
To understand

627
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:11,427
Their insanity.

628
01:02:11,493 --> 01:02:13,429
[rustling]

629
01:02:17,399 --> 01:02:18,867
[rustling]

630
01:02:30,245 --> 01:02:32,214
[speaking native language]

631
01:02:39,955 --> 01:02:41,390
[grunts]

632
01:02:43,992 --> 01:02:46,228
These now
Are the weapons.

633
01:02:56,571 --> 01:02:58,374
[speaking native language]

634
01:02:59,441 --> 01:03:00,442
Youssef!

635
01:03:00,508 --> 01:03:01,577
That's enough.

636
01:03:01,643 --> 01:03:03,712
I am sorry, captain.

637
01:03:03,779 --> 01:03:05,747
He's a dirty desert child.

638
01:03:05,813 --> 01:03:06,882
You cannot expect--

639
01:03:09,984 --> 01:03:11,453
Youssef,
What's he saying?

640
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:12,854
It's nonsense.

641
01:03:12,921 --> 01:03:14,789
He claims his father
Was the tracker

642
01:03:14,856 --> 01:03:15,991
Killed on this mission.

643
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:18,660
It is because of you
My father is dead!

644
01:03:18,727 --> 01:03:20,162
You, you, you!

645
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,830
[youssef speaking
Native language]

646
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,770
He has sworn revenge.

647
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:32,207
He has included us...

648
01:03:32,273 --> 01:03:34,410
Among the condemned.

649
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,447
Perhaps we are.

650
01:03:42,017 --> 01:03:46,621
Youssef: there are many
Child vipers like him

651
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:48,290
In the army
Of khalu jabbar.

652
01:03:51,393 --> 01:03:52,928
What's he saying
About jabbar?

653
01:03:52,994 --> 01:03:54,396
[tamil shouting]

654
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:57,232
He want to give us
The information

655
01:03:57,298 --> 01:03:59,401
Important to jabbar

656
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:01,570
In trade
For his freedom.

657
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,438
Wellford: what kind
Of information?

658
01:04:03,505 --> 01:04:05,240
This information, captain.

659
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:12,381
You are fluent in arabic
Now, sergeant nichols?

660
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:14,716
No, i can't read a word.

661
01:04:14,782 --> 01:04:16,351
You see,
On the back page here,

662
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:19,154
These 4 double rows
Of numbers.

663
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:21,690
I may be wrong,
And i hope i am,

664
01:04:21,756 --> 01:04:23,158
But they form
The matrix

665
01:04:23,225 --> 01:04:26,161
For sequencing
And authenticator codes.

666
01:04:26,895 --> 01:04:27,896
[sighs]

667
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:31,399
Well, you know...

668
01:04:31,466 --> 01:04:33,535
For a nuclear detonation.

669
01:04:37,972 --> 01:04:39,374
I am my father's son!

670
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:40,542
Ahh, hush!

671
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:43,378
[speaking
Native language]

672
01:04:43,445 --> 01:04:45,713
I don't know what the hell
You're talkin' about, kid,

673
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,850
But i'd love
To hear about it.

674
01:04:50,785 --> 01:04:52,721
[footsteps]

675
01:05:03,565 --> 01:05:05,400
[sighs]

676
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,872
We all make
Mistakes, mike.

677
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,456
Negative, sir.

678
01:05:27,522 --> 01:05:28,690
We're monitoring
All frequencies,

679
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:29,758
But so far we--

680
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:32,761
So we sit tight
And keep listening.

681
01:05:34,529 --> 01:05:37,532
Do you think they're
With the first patrol, sir?

682
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,169
I don't know what
To think, corporal.

683
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,872
That team soldiered...

684
01:05:43,939 --> 01:05:46,307
You know what i mean?

685
01:05:46,374 --> 01:05:47,943
I guess what
I'm saying is, sir,

686
01:05:48,009 --> 01:05:50,044
I'd like to put
My name in the hat

687
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:52,280
When h.q. Authorizes
Another search.

688
01:05:52,347 --> 01:05:54,482
There won't be
Another team, corporal.

689
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:55,717
Sir?

690
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:57,219
Headquarters felt
Wellford's team

691
01:05:57,285 --> 01:05:58,219
Was ill-advised.

692
01:05:58,286 --> 01:05:59,421
Whatever
Those poor bastards

693
01:05:59,487 --> 01:06:00,822
Are up against
Out there,

694
01:06:00,889 --> 01:06:02,891
They're up
Against it alone.

695
01:06:05,126 --> 01:06:06,461
Wellford:
If the boy is right,

696
01:06:06,528 --> 01:06:08,430
That means jabbar is
About to take delivery

697
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:11,566
Or has in his possession
A nuclear device.

698
01:06:11,632 --> 01:06:13,835
It makes sense if you
Think about it, captain.

699
01:06:13,902 --> 01:06:15,837
That massacred
Patrol back there--

700
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:17,606
Can't have any
Snoopin' around

701
01:06:17,672 --> 01:06:19,607
If you're waitin'
For a hot delivery.

702
01:06:19,674 --> 01:06:21,142
Youssef: why would
The bhandari force

703
01:06:21,209 --> 01:06:23,478
Want to keep
The ipf patrol

704
01:06:23,545 --> 01:06:25,781
From stopping jabbar?
Why?!

705
01:06:25,847 --> 01:06:27,749
You don't believe that
Was a bhandari unit,

706
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:28,583
Do you, nichols?

707
01:06:28,649 --> 01:06:30,385
Nah, it's too pat.

708
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:32,520
Bits of i.d.

709
01:06:32,587 --> 01:06:34,189
Transport weapons
Unrecovered--

710
01:06:34,255 --> 01:06:35,524
What kind
Of covert raid

711
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:36,691
Would be
That sloppy?

712
01:06:36,758 --> 01:06:39,861
Tamil said that
The cave very close,

713
01:06:39,928 --> 01:06:42,396
Maybe 3 hours out.

714
01:06:42,463 --> 01:06:44,866
And we are the only
Ones who know.

715
01:06:44,933 --> 01:06:47,903
No radios. No recon.

716
01:06:47,969 --> 01:06:49,905
 No air support.

717
01:06:49,971 --> 01:06:51,139
Wellford: look, guys.

718
01:06:51,205 --> 01:06:54,208
I know we're a rescue
And relief operation

719
01:06:54,275 --> 01:06:55,810
And our objective
Is peace,

720
01:06:55,877 --> 01:06:57,846
But there's
A big bomb out there.

721
01:06:58,946 --> 01:07:02,383
I say we take care
Of business.

722
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:04,385
Youssef: insanity.

723
01:07:04,452 --> 01:07:05,520
[sighs]

724
01:07:05,586 --> 01:07:08,490
You are speaking insanity!

725
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:11,359
We have no other choice.
Besides, i believe what

726
01:07:11,426 --> 01:07:12,694
The kid's saying is true.

727
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,663
Lies! Fabrications!

728
01:07:14,729 --> 01:07:16,832
Why are you
So certain?

729
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:20,302
In here, i feel it!

730
01:07:20,368 --> 01:07:22,137
Allah, be merciful.

731
01:07:22,203 --> 01:07:23,672
It is a gift.

732
01:07:23,738 --> 01:07:27,075
Morton: funny thing about
That gift of yours.

733
01:07:27,142 --> 01:07:30,245
You take us
Down into a canyon,

734
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:32,313

We're face-to-face

735

With jabbar's rockets.

736
01:07:34,782 --> 01:07:37,319
And the dead city
You took us to--

737
01:07:37,385 --> 01:07:38,920
We wake up
Right in the middle

Of times square.

739
01:07:40,455 --> 01:07:41,589
What?!

740
01:07:41,656 --> 01:07:42,824
Come to think of it,

741
01:07:42,891 --> 01:07:44,526
We've done enough
Doubling back

742
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,761
And rerouting to
Slow us to a crawl.

743
01:07:46,828 --> 01:07:48,563
I'm not listening
To this.

744
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:50,165
You have been
Selling the kid

745
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:51,900
As a spy
Pretty hard.

746
01:07:51,966 --> 01:07:54,803
Well, maybe
We do have a spy.

747
01:07:55,937 --> 01:07:57,839
Well, maybe
It's you.

748
01:08:01,476 --> 01:08:03,345

01:08:37,444 --> 01:08:40,348
A terrible tracker.

758
01:08:48,989 --> 01:08:54,462
But i am the worst
Tracker in all ayazad.

759
01:09:05,873 --> 01:09:08,175
Oh, i'm gonna get
Myself killed for you.

760
01:09:08,243 --> 01:09:10,312

We're gonna look like
A pair of cheap chandeliers.

 And sergeant morton?

Until we've talked.

01:15:09,003 --> 01:15:11,206
It's a short-range haft.

Range of only 186 miles.

Yes.

01:15:38,766 --> 01:15:40,568
So what am i missing?

849
01:15:41,769 --> 01:15:43,737
The missile isn't
Aimed at bhandar.

850

It's aimed at your
Own country ayazad.

01:20:40,534 --> 01:20:42,970
Then it's one big
Happy family.

913
01:20:43,037 --> 01:20:45,873
12 minutes
And 30 seconds anyway.

914
01:23:24,365 --> 01:23:26,233
Youssef.

915
01:23:26,299 --> 01:23:27,702
I think
That maybe you--

916
01:23:27,768 --> 01:23:32,807
Captain, i should
Like to remain here...

917
01:23:32,873 --> 01:23:35,209
With your permission.

918
01:23:42,783 --> 01:23:44,552
Permission granted.

919
01:23:48,388 --> 01:23:51,024
You cover our backs,
Friend.

920
01:23:51,091 --> 01:23:54,896
No one shall pass.

921
01:24:07,408 --> 01:24:08,542
[rattling]

922
01:24:11,645 --> 01:24:14,849
[klaxon blares]

923
01:24:23,924 --> 01:24:27,161
Have you really
Thought this through?

924
01:24:29,463 --> 01:24:31,365
[klaxon blares]

925
01:24:52,619 --> 01:24:54,655
System's down.

926
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:56,757
Diana:
Are we ok?

927
01:24:56,824 --> 01:24:58,759
It'll take a few minutes
To re-initialize.

928
01:25:00,394 --> 01:25:02,396
We'll be ok.

929
01:25:02,463 --> 01:25:04,832
I do not think so.

930
01:25:14,942 --> 01:25:16,277
Ivan: sonya...

931
01:25:16,343 --> 01:25:17,878
My sonya.

932
01:25:17,945 --> 01:25:21,849
You never cease to surprise
And delight me.

933
01:25:36,963 --> 01:25:40,701
Filthy money grubber.

934
01:25:40,767 --> 01:25:43,170
You've served your purpose.

935
01:25:43,237 --> 01:25:47,474
Did you really think i would
Leave you free to operate?

936
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:52,212
To perhaps deal
With my enemies?

937
01:25:52,278 --> 01:25:54,215
As a student of chess,

938
01:25:54,281 --> 01:25:59,219
I should think such strategy
Would be obvious.

939
01:25:59,285 --> 01:26:02,556
My pawn becomes queen.

940
01:26:07,361 --> 01:26:12,400
[weakly]
Knight takes queen.

941
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,302
[clicks empty]

942
01:26:49,369 --> 01:26:51,338
Aah!

943
01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:52,473
[shouts]

944
01:27:06,586 --> 01:27:07,555
Aah!

945
01:27:08,956 --> 01:27:10,691
[men shouting
In distance]

946
01:27:17,264 --> 01:27:18,765
Nichols: you all right?

947
01:27:18,832 --> 01:27:21,602
I'm ok.

948
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:24,338
[gunfire, shouting,
Klaxon blaring]

949
01:27:26,206 --> 01:27:28,642
Stay with nichols.

950
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:31,244
He'll need you
If they get past us.

951
01:27:31,311 --> 01:27:32,379
Youssef: captain!

952
01:27:45,859 --> 01:27:47,627
If we have 5 minutes
Left to live,

953
01:27:47,694 --> 01:27:49,697
Who'd you want
To spend it with?

954
01:27:50,831 --> 01:27:53,567
I don't know.

955
01:27:53,634 --> 01:27:55,603
Ask me again in 6.

956
01:28:01,842 --> 01:28:06,546
Captain,
What if i go out?

957
01:28:06,613 --> 01:28:10,851
Please help me.
The missile will explode!

958
01:28:16,456 --> 01:28:17,525
Youssef!

959
01:28:31,972 --> 01:28:33,474
I did it.
I did it!

960
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:34,674
 I did it!

961
01:28:34,741 --> 01:28:36,677
I did it.
The warhead's deactivated.

962
01:28:43,817 --> 01:28:44,818
[gunfire]

963
01:28:44,884 --> 01:28:49,156
Brothers,
Listen to me--

964
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:58,531
Our work's
Finished, sir.

965
01:28:58,598 --> 01:28:59,533
Not yet.

966
01:28:59,599 --> 01:29:01,635
The charge i set
Goes off in 2 minutes.

967
01:29:04,237 --> 01:29:05,806
Let's go!

968
01:29:07,507 --> 01:29:10,411
[gunfire]

969
01:29:43,977 --> 01:29:45,846
[speaking native language]

970
01:30:06,266 --> 01:30:08,869
Sir, we've monitored
A violent tremor

971
01:30:08,935 --> 01:30:11,371
In the cave region
Of the ayazad desert.

972
01:30:11,438 --> 01:30:12,639
Natural?

973
01:30:12,706 --> 01:30:14,774
It's an explosion,
Sir.

974
01:30:14,841 --> 01:30:16,210
A massive one.

975
01:30:18,545 --> 01:30:20,848
I got a bad feeling
About this, colonel.

976
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:11,431
I ain't going home in a box!

977
01:31:11,498 --> 01:31:12,866
Not for you.

978
01:31:39,425 --> 01:31:41,729
Well, maybe
We do have a spy.

979
01:32:04,951 --> 01:32:07,253
I supply the wood
And the nails.

980
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,890
It is for jabbar
To build the coffins.

981
01:32:22,335 --> 01:32:25,906
If i'm guiding,
We may never find

982
01:32:25,972 --> 01:32:27,441
That cave.
