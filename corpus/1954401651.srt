1
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,383
Woman:
<i>It started out</i> <i>as an experiment.</i>

2
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,119
<i>The first change</i>
<i>was in the eyes.</i>

3
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,854
<i>The iris separated</i>
<i>from the pupil</i>

4
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,589
<i>and it followed</i>
<i>movement</i>

5
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,757
like a motion
detector.

6
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,059
<i>I'd watch them</i>
<i>hours on end</i>

7
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,661
<i>and when they'd see me,</i>
<i>they'd stare back,</i>

8
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,264
<i>unblinking, unemotional.</i>

9
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,433
<i>Sometimes I swear</i>
<i>they were laughing at me.</i>

10
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,035
<i>We didn't mean for things</i>
<i>to go as far as they did,</i>

11
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,638
<i>but in a world that's</i>
<i>mostly covered with water</i>

12
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,807
<i>we needed a new</i>
<i>kind of defense.</i>

13
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:58,277
<i>Just another fish</i>
<i>in the sea.</i>

14
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,880
<i>But we made</i>
<i>a horrible mistake.</i>

15
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,482
<i>We meant to take the next</i>
<i>step in evolution,</i>

16
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,651
<i>but we created</i>
<i>a monster.</i>

17
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,269
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

18
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,715

19
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,355
- ( chuckles )
- How do you make that sound?

20
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,090
It's a family
secret.

21
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,258
But I can tell you
it's one of the reasons

22
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,295
Mom's had so many
rich husbands.

23
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,331
- ( all laugh )
- Change your mind yet?

24
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,368
It's not too late.
We can forget about the whole thing.

25
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,970
- Yeah, sure.
- There are plenty of other pledges

26
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,007

to be in your place.

27
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,609

28
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,513
Let's go.

29
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,019
( all snickering )

30
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,563
Thank heavens
for Home Depot.

31
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,298
( all laugh )

32
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,502
- What about the power?
- It's usually off.

33
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,781
- ( screams )
- ( all scream )

34
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,324
( laughs )

35
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,926
( all laughing )

36
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,432
More government BS.

37
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,035
Very professional.

38
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,638
Crime runs in the family.
Daddy's a lawyer.

39
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,806
( girls chuckle )

40
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,747
<i>( foghorn blows )</i>

41
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,773
You know
the drill:

42
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,941
Swim out to
the buoy and back.

43
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,677
Couldn't be
any easier.

44
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,412
The sign said
the water's polluted.

45
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,147
Am I gonna get
sick or something?

46
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,749
We all had to do it.

47
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,485
Do we look sick?

48
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,256
Do you want to be
a Delta Delta Chi or don't you?

49
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,292
Ready?

50
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,028
I guess so.

51
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,630
That's the Delta
Delta spirit!

52
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,811

53
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,980
<i>( bell rings )</i>

54
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,523
You're such a liar.
We didn't have to do this.

55
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,259
What if something
happens to her?

56
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,861

You want <i>her</i> in the sorority?

There's something

61
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,391
There's something out here
in the water!

62
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,127
Nice try!

63
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,729
I'm not kidding!
I felt--

64
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,646
What's she doing?

65
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,586
Screw it, let's
get out of here.

You are trespassing

70
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,732
- Stay where you are.
- If I get caught my dad's gonna have a shit fit.

71
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,334
- What are we supposed to do?
- Take the back way out.

72
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,937
We can't just leave.
What about my dad's car?

73
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,745
Good evening.

74
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,192
- ( screams )
- Mel!

75
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,360
<i>Mel!</i>

00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,529
Mel?

87
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,184
Way to go, Doc!

88
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,786
You just tied
the world record of 12 ringers in a row,

89
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,955
held by none
other than...

90
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,426
your-rr
husban-nnd!

91
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,895
Ex-husband.

92
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,631
You're the boss.

93
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,233
Hot Pants wants
us in his office.

94
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,703
Yeah, your record's about
to go down in flames.

95
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,439
He sounded
serious.

96
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,607
( sighs )

97
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,776
As always, your
timing is sublime.

98
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,356
Correct me
if I'm wrong,

99
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,958
didn't they invent
something called an elevator

100
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,693
about 100
years ago?

101
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,163
1853,
to be exact.

102
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,331
Why would you
know that?

103
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,368
- It's what you
love about me. - Loved.

104
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,405
And it still doesn't
explain why we can't use it.

105
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,441
He thinks if we're out
of breath we won't argue with him so much.

106
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,477
Is that it?

107
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,514
Where do you get
that information?

108
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,105
<i>( door buzzing )</i>

109
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,553
Morning, Dr. Collins,
Dr. Collins.

110
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,288
You wanted
to see us?

111
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,059
I didn't have
breakfast.

112
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,963
- You know what this is?
- Our project.

113
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,264
No.

114
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,433
Not anymore.
Over.

115
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,470
- Over?
- You're kidding.

116
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,205
Do I look like I have
my kidding face on?

117
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,675
Is this about
the EKG test data? Because I told Dr. Collins--

118
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,711
It's about the fact
that I have three hysterical college girls

119
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,314
in the hospital right now.
No no, let me rephrase that.

120
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,350
I have three and a half
hysterical girls in there.

121
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,386
The divers are still
trying to locate the rest of the fourth one.

122
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,555
That doesn't make
any sense.

123
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,158
Even if the sharks could
breach the steel net--

124
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,459
Which they did.

125
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,797
There is no way into this
compound past the 6,000 volts

126
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,532
going through
the perimeter fence.

127
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,267
Is there?

128
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,677
There have been
budget shortfalls.

129
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,413
We had to make up
the difference somewhere.

130
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,883
My God, you turned off
the electric fence?

131
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,618
- Intermittently.
- You didn't, Larry.

132
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:36,521
How many times have
I told you, Dr. Collins, my name is Lawrence?

133
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,690
I wouldn't have to make
any cutbacks if you two

134
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:42,161
had brought me some
results that I could take to the oversight committee.

135
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,763
I'm sorry,
you don't consider genetically engineering

136
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,932
a new breed of Great White
sharks results?

137
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,534
Capable of living in either
fresh or salt water,

138
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,137
trained to recognize
specific targets to defend?

139
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,174
That was yesterday.
What have you done for me lately?

140
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,644
Okay, we have managed
to increase their speed.

141
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,680
Ah-na-na!  I just want
to know one thing:

142
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,282
Are the subjects
responding to commands?

143
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,525
May I?

144
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,198
All right, Doc.
I'm on it.

145
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,674
Okay, there's
Avery now.

146
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,313
It's show time.

147
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,253
He's scared.
I guess that's a good thing.

148
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,325
( tires squeal )

149
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,928
Okay, here they come.

150
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,737
My God!

151
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,376
Carcharodon carcharias
can smell blood

152
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:14,713
in dilutions of one part
to 500 million parts of water.

153
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,448
Killer schnozzes.

154
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,183
They're bigger
than last time.

155
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,785
Groucho, Harpo,
Chico, Gummo, Zeppo.

156
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,954
"The Sharks Brothers."

157
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,593
And here's the baddest
boy in class...

158
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,762
<i>Red Dog.</i>

159
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,872
Okay, watch this.
Avery?

160
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,474
- <i>( electronic beeping )</i>
- Marla: <i>Now.</i>

161
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,510
You got it, Doc.

162
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,150
That was you?

163
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,620
The monitoring implants
in each shark are also transceivers.

164
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,788
We issue the command
and the shark receives

165
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,090
a small electric jolt
to the brain

166
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,126
that essentially fools
it into forgetting about the meat.

167
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,728
Does it work the other
way around?

168
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,464
I mean, can the shark
be signaled to attack?

169
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,536
Well, they are predators.
I guess they could be trained--

170
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,139
The purpose
of the Blue Demon Project was to create

171
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,307
an undetectable
defense system, not another weapon.

172
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,910
Of course.
I'm just thinking out loud.

173
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,513
Comfortable?

174
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,129
So it doesn't work
on all of them?

175
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,297
It's 50-50
with Red Dog.

176
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,033
We don't know why.

177
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,803
Let me get
this straight.

178
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,539
You've spent four years

179
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,707
and millions of dollars
on this project

180
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,744
and all I have to show
for it are a couple of big sharks with pretty eyes?

181
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,685
90 days!
I have a show-and-tell with the big brass.

182
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,287
It's a funding review,
so that we can all keep our jobs!

183
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,022
<i>I want concrete results,</i>

184
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,625
something that will hold
water besides their lungs.

185
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,360
It's new science,
it's unstable.

186
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,528
We have to examine it,
understand it.

187
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,264
We can't possibly make
that deadline.

188
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,866
We're at least a year away
from controlling them.

189
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,602
Hmm.

190
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,204
I'm glad to see you two
agree on something.

191
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,674
That'll give you something
to talk about when you're in the unemployment line!

192
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,578
Get out!

193

00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,386
That went well.

195
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,687
I have nothing
to say to you.

196
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,422
That would be a first.

197
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,025

00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,326

00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,494
- Which one?
- Which one?

200

- Dr. Nathan Collins.
- Guilty.

You seem a little

And what's that?
Nathan?

221
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,834

Listen up, boys.

Word of advice:
Don't get married.

Got it?

234
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,334
Maybe she doesn't really
want a divorce.

Psychologically,

00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,574
Maybe somewhere deep
in her subconscious

238
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,310
she still has
feelings for you,

239
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,780
and it's causing
her body to rebel against her own actions.

240
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,382
That's why she can't
get the ring off.

241
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,551

Ladies and gentlemen,

301
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,844
Thank you all for coming
this morning for what is quite possibly

302
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:50,315
the most important
presentation you'll ever see.

303
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,483
Now, I'd like to present
General Remora,

304
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,652
who would like to say
a few words before we begin.

305
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,388
General.

306
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,865
What I'm about
to say to you...

307
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,902
must be kept...

308
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,239
in the utmost...

309
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,348
confidence.

310
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,253
That is why

311
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,855
I had to get a Level Five
security clearance

312
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,156
for each and every
one of you.

313
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,193
And that's why
we're meeting in this underwater...

314
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,566
secured
and protected bunker.

315
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:49,941
In 1997,

316
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,844
the Russian government
informed us...

317
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,182
that it
may have lost

318
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,785
at least 100

319
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,255
of their so-called
"suitcase bombs."

00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,725
One kiloton...

322
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,665
portable nuclear bombs,

323
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,401
small enough
and light enough

324
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,003
to be carried
in a suitcase.

325
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,341
And very possibly
a backpack.

326
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,413
- What's your name?
- Dashlow.

327
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,884
- What?
- Dr. Avery Dashlow, sir.

328
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,185
Right.

329
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,257
For some time
we've been concerned

330
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:44,161
about the possibility
of terrorist threat.

331
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:48,065
And as of three days ago,
our intelligence

332
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,969
has informed us that
one of these bombs

333
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,705
had been purchased by
a splinter group

334
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,873
from an ex-Russian agent.

335
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:01,946
Nathan, I know this
isn't exactly the time to bring this up,

336
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,548
- but...
- Yes?

337
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,151
- Um...
- Ahem!

338
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,754
It can wait.

339
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,224
Further intelligence
has informed us

340
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,995
that this bomb will
more than likely

341
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,598
be arriving by water.

342
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,369
And its goal

343
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,105
very possibly being

344
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,273
a very important
landmark

345
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,009
on or near
this coast.

346
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,948
That is why
Project Blue Demon

347
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,551
is of the utmost importance
to our government.

348
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,624
And, as Mr. Van Allen
already knows,

349
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:50,961
as of yesterday,
the President of the United States of America

350
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,130
has personally
asked me...

351
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,468
to oversee
this project.

352
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,673
I'd like everyone to put
their hands in their lap.

353
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:06,143
Very good.

354
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,180
I will now turn everything
back over to Mr. Van Allen.

355
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,084
General.

356
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,289
Now,

357
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,325
this represents
the approximate square mileage

358
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,928
of accessible water
in and around the country.

359
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,096
You know I hate
when you do that.

360
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,832
Do what?

361
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,000
Tell me you have
something to tell me

362
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,169
and then telling me
to forget about it.

363
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,941
Lawrence:
<i>So what is the answer?</i>

364
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,977
More military?
More Coast Guard?

365
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,146
It would take three times
the current numbers

366
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,882
of enlisted men
and women

367
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,617
just to make a dent.

368
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:49,087
No, the human element
has done all that it can.

369
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,990
It's time now to take
the next step

370
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:56,027
toward complete
military preparedness.

371
00:29:56,027 --> 00:30:00,364
I present
Project Blue Demon...

372
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,702
a squadron of genetically
engineered sharks,

373
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,738
smarter and stronger than
any other species on earth.

374
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,907
Trained and controlled

375
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,643
by our military
and strategic experts

376
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,811
to seek out and neutralize

377
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,980
terrorist threats wherever
they may be found.

378
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,317
Maybe I do it because
you never seem interested

379
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,053
in anything I have
to say anyway.

380
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,655
Maybe if you'd say things
that were interesting,

381
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,824
instead of dull scientific
facts all the time,

382
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,560
I would be.

383
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,162
A bomb
surreptitiously placed

384
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,897
by an innocuous
looking vessel--

385
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:37,234
<i>the sort of thing that even</i>
<i>the most watchful security</i> <i>system might miss.</i>

386
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,403
But Blue Demon
misses nothing.

387
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:43,307
<i>Its natural</i>
<i>and genetically-heightened</i> <i>territorial instinct.</i>

388
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,910
<i>The shark locates the bomb</i>
<i>before it can detonate.</i>

389
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:51,115
Now, if this sounds like
science fiction, it's not.

390
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,283
It's science fact.

391
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,754
- So are you gonna tell me?
- Not when you've predetermined your response.

392
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,790
Can you stop being
scientific for one moment

393
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,092
and start being
a human being?

394
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,297
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

395
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,767
All right, I'll tell you,
but you have to promise that you won't be angry.

396
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,935
- I'm not--!
- Nathan!

397
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,104
I'm not angry.

398
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,708
Open the curtain.

399
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,612
<i>( murmuring )</i>

400
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,214
Blue Demon.

401
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,382
Okay.

402
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,853
I...
you know--

403
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,889
See, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

404
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,866
Is this supposed to be
some kind of a joke?

405
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,806
Oh my God.

406
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,779
- <i>( tapping keyboard )</i>
- <i>( computer beeps )</i>

407
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,515
Where the hell
are my sharks?

408
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,660
- Somebody opened the gate.
- Don't even say it.

409
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,263
What happened to the, uh--

410
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,299
- Who let the guppies out?
- Apparently none of us.

411
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,203
I don't give a good
goddamn who let them out! I want them back in here now!

412
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,371
I got some very important
people in there waiting,

413
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,974
so I don't want
to hear the word rain check from any one of you.

414
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,143
I'll just send the command
out to Red Dog

415
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,746
and the others will follow
him back into the lake.

416
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,348
If he's still out there.

417
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,951
What are you talking
about, Dashlow?

418
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,554
Something's wrong.
I just sent out a return command

419
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,289
and I'm not getting
a delivery signal.

420
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,024
Did you try an
alternate channel?

421
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,192
I'm on full frequency--
nothing!

422
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,494
Let me try.

423
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,096
Anybody got the time?

424
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:49,567
Too damn late
for this bullshit! That's what time it is.

425
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,977
Hey, did you guys
hide my respirator?

426
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,483
You dogs, I know you hid
my respirator!

427
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,291
What are those?

428
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,798
We were scheduled
to keep the sharks inside all day today.

429
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,701
- And?
- Maintenance is in the water.

430
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,738
Normal replacement of section
of perimeter fence.

431
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,546
Nathan:
<i>Maintenance, this is</i> <i>an emergency, do you copy?</i>

432
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:39,449
<i>Maintenance, this is</i>
<i>Dr. Nathan Collins.</i> <i>Do you read me?</i>

433
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,920
Maintenance, this is
Dr. Nathan Collins.

434
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,655
You need to get out
of the water now!

435
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,390
Do you read me?
Over.

436
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,559
How much longer are we
gonna have to wait

437
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,029
for these trained
fish of yours?

438
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,066
Just a few more
moments, sir.

439
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,801
There's been a small
miscommunication

440
00:33:56,801 --> 00:34:00,704
and they've been
moved out into an enclosed high-security lagoon.

441
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,307
Part of our facility.
But there's nothing to worry about.

442
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,909
Everything's
under control.

443
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,081
<i>( crunch )</i>

444
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,866
- Still not getting anything.
- Well try another transmitter.

445
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,034
I tried all of them.
I can't seem to get a response.

446
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,203
Dr. Collins, if you people
screw this thing up--

447
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,372
Nathan:
<i>Marla, do you read me, over?</i>

448
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,974
- I'm here, Nathan.
- Give me some good news.

449
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,710
I'm working on it!

450
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,782
Nathan, what are they
still doing in the water?

451
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,518
Nobody's answering
the radio.

452
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,686
We're on our way
out there now. Copy?

453
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:26,157
( beeping )

454
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,361
Oh my God.

455
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,097
Nathan, the sharks,

456
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,699
they're in hunt
formation.

457
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,602
Nathan:
<i>Maintenance, this is</i> <i>an emergency, do you copy?</i>

458
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,338
Yeah, it's always
an emergency.

459
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,374
Someone probably
plugged up the toilet again.

460
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:46,844
<i>Maintenance, this is</i>
<i>an emergency, do you copy?</i> <i>This is an emergency!</i>

461
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:49,446
Yeah, this is maintenance.
What's your emergency?

462
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,917
There are sharks in the lake!
Do you copy?

463
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,953
Ed, Jimmy!

464
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,555
Get out of the water!
There's sharks in the water!

465
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,724
<i>Get out!</i>

466
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:04,628
Ed, Jimmy, come on!
Get in the-- no!

467
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,797
<i>Get out of the water!</i>

468
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,618
Katie:
<i>Jimmy!</i>  Ed!

469
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,803
( crying )
Oh, God!

470
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,104
( tires screech )

471
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,815
Oh my God!

472
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,984
They were just out there!

473
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,792
- It's over.
- No, it's not over.

474
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,166
This is just
the beginning.

475
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,768
<i>( Katie sobbing )</i>

476
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,213
Tell me you
got something.

477
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,381
Every hard drive
in the system's up to speed.

478
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,117
Not a crash,
not a buzz.

479
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,285
- Nothing.
- Could have told you that.

480
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,322
I know this lab inside and out
and there's nothing wrong with this equipment.

481
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:14,792
I've got six runaway sharks.
Who would beg to differ?

482
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,298
They're moving towards
populated areas.

483
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,768
I thought you had
this problem worked out.

484
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,937
Whoever let them out
sabotaged the system.

485
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,539
Then I guess it's time
for the backup plan.

486
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,613
You do have
a backup plan?

487
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,818
How 'bout a reboot?
Maybe we should just shut the whole thing down

488
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,420
- and start from scratch.
- Brilliant, Sparky.

489
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,722
- Worth a try.
- It'll take time.

490
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,324
- Then you'd better
get on it right now. - What are you gonna do?

491
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,361
What we should have
done in the first place. I'm calling the Coast Guard

492
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,963
to let them know
we got a predator problem on our hands.

493
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,999
I don't think so, Doctor.
Put that phone down.

494
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,602
General!
Thought you had left.

495
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,204
As I stated before,
we've decided

496
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,807
we're not going to do
the demonstration today.

497
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,121
They're not in
the lagoon, are they?

498
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,724
( coughs )

499
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,893
We've got the situation
under control.

500
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:34,171
- <i>( siren wails )</i>
- Voice: <i>T-minus 10,</i> nine, eight--

501
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,773
<i>( switches off )</i>

502
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,810
Doesn't look like you
have anything under control.

503
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,280
They're headed toward beaches.
We have to warn people. Tell them.

504
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,015
Tell them what?

505
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,617
That a group of government
sanctioned

506
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,220
genetic experiments
has gotten loose?

507
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,389
No.

508
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,426
If they found out that
the military was behind this,

509
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:59,329
we'd be in a shitstorm
of apocalyptic proportions!

510
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,836
No, I think what
we have here is

511
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:09,306
just regular, everyday
run-of-the-mill sharks.

512
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,776
And the truth of the matter
is sharks kill people,

513
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,512
every day.

514
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,981
But not in
a freshwater lake.

515
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,150
Minor detail.

516
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,054
Are you actually
willing to risk life

517
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:27,090
just to keep the government's
involvement in this a secret?

518
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,693
That is indefensible
and bullshit!

519
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,295
You watch it, Doctor.

520
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:38,368
Innocent people
will be killed.

521
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,971
Every war has
their casualties.

522
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:44,441
I don't see any reason
the war on terrorism should be any different.

523
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,683
Screw that.

524
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:56,586
<i>( door buzzes )</i>

525
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,166
Get me the number
for the Coast Guard. Yeah.

526
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,202
Hey, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

527
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:17,407
Don't worry, Doctor,
you'll get to make your one phone call.

528
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,444
- What are you talking about?
- Dr. Nathan Collins,

529
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,046
- you're under arrest.
- On what charge?

530
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:26,517
Conspiracy to commit
a terrorist act against the United States of America.

531
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,685
General, I understand what
you're trying to do here,

532
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,854
but you have no
evidence of anything like that.

533
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,590
I have all the evidence
I need.

534
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:38,228
This is a log for all
the security pass codes for the shark pool.

535
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,397
And it has the number
of the last code used

536
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,565
- to open the gates.
- And whose number is that?

537
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,602
- Dr. Nathan Collins.
- ( snorts ) Please.

538
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,205
Which means are you
not only responsible

539
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:50,373
for letting those sharks
out into the lagoon,

540
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,109
but you are responsible
for the deaths

541
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,277
of those two unfortunate
maintenance workers.

542
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,748
He's doing this because
he doesn't want me telling anyone about the sharks.

543
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,916
I'm doing this because
I love my country.

544
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,652
Take him away.

545
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,423
Get me a lawyer!

546
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,364
This is not over!

547
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,717
No, like this.
You have to hook the worm through his body

548
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:08,885
like that so he doesn't
fall off the hook.

549
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,054
Here, now you try.

550
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,091
I don't want to.

551
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,127
Honey, the worm
doesn't feel anything. It doesn't hurt him.

552
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,729
Yeah, how would you like it
if I stuck a hook up your--

553
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,465
That's enough,
young lady.

554
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:23,200
Why do we have
to do this anyway?

555
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,935
Can't we just buy fish
at the store?

556
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,537
No, we can't just buy
fish at the store.

557
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:31,008
That's not a sport.
This is a sport.

558
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:34,044
Baseball's a sport.
Basketball's a sport.

559
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,779
This is murder!

560
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,815
Roxie, honey, you wanted
to spend some time with Daddy, didn't you?

561
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,852
- Yeah.
- And you wanted to go fishing with Daddy, too, didn't you?

562
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:45,755
- Yes.
- Now you got a 10-lb. test line here,

563
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,057
with an eight-lb.
leader.

564
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,093
Just set it over
the side right here.

565
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,395
There you go.

566
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:54,431
All right, now we'll just see
who catches the big one, huh?

567
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:14,384
Hey, what's up, doc?

568
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,553
Oh, I guess I'm just
a little blurry here.

569
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,288
Yeah, you gonna
go somewhere?

570
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,023
Just a little fresh air.
Be right back.

571
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:23,494
You want me
to go with you?

572
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:27,397
Avery, "fresh air"
is a euphemism.

573
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,566
I'm going to
the ladies' room.

574
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,734
- Oh.
- Yeah.

575
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,340
<i>( reel spinning )</i>

576
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,508
Dad, I think
I've got something!

577
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:15,545
Way to go!
Reel him in!

578
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,582
- <i>Not too fast.</i>
- It's really heavy.

579
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,618
It's probably a trout.
They get pretty big in these waters.

580
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,786
( reel spinning faster )

581
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,522
Dad!  Dad!

582
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:36,366
Whoa, you got yourself
a whopper here, girl!

583
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,534
Let's try to get him in now.
Let's reel it in.

584
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:41,571
That's it, bring
it in here.

585
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,307
Yeah, it's
a big one!

586
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:48,078
Wowee!
Okay, here it comes.

587
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,813
Roxie:
Oh my God!

588
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:53,716
You got him!
Let's get him. Oh, yeah!

589
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:55,885
Okay, good job!

590
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,488
Oh, yeah!

591
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,525
Look what you
caught here!

592
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,127
Hold it,
I'll get a photo. Slimy!

593
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,164
- Let me get a photo.
Okay, hold it up. - It's wet!

594
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,899
Attagirl.
Hold it right there.

595
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:17,140
- ( gasps )
- What the hell?

596
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:20,177
- What's the matter, honey?
- It's a shark!

597
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,779
It's a bass,
silly.

598
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,683
<i>Dad! </i> Dad!

599
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,851
Shark!
Hurry, swim!

600
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:35,359
Come on!  Come on!
Come on!  Come on!

601
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,395
- Swim!
- Dad, grab this!

602
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,563
Swim, that's right!

603
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:47,937
Don't look back!
Swim!  Come on!

604
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,709
You can make it.
Give me your hand.

605
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,782
Dad, keep swimming.
Please, hurry!

606
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,384
Sharks, that way!

607
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,590
There you go!

608
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:12,229
I got you.

609
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,904
Dad, I love you.

610
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,072
I love you, Dad.

611
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,125
Marla!
Thank God, finally!

612
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,161
Did you talk to the lawyer?
Is he coming down to get me out of here?

613
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,897
I'm afraid not,
Nathan.

614
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:50,367
What, are you kidding me?
They can't just hold me here

615
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,969
without formal charges,
without any evidence.

616
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,572
Well apparently
they can.

617
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,608
Just the suspicion
of you being a terrorist

618
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,211
is enough for them
to lock you up in here indefinitely.

619
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,946
Wait, this is nuts.

620
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,983
I brought you some food.

621
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:09,019
I feel like I'm stuck
in some play by Kafka.

622
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,621
Watch your language,
sir.

623
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,790
- What?
- Your language.

624
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:18,127
- I said Kafka.
- I heard what you said.

625
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,429
There's a lady present.

626
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,597
Appreciate it if
you'd keep it clean.

627
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,370
I'll take that, ma'am.

628
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,105
Oh, do you mind?

629
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,141
I would really like to eat
with Doctor Collins. Please?

630
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,912
- I'll have to check it.
- It's nothing special,

631
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,515
but it was all they had
in the cafeteria. ( chuckles )

632
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,683
- All right.
- ( pistol fires )

633
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,154
Christ, Marla, what
the hell are you doing?

634
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:46,322
Getting you out
of here.

635
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,491
I appreciate the thought,

636
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:51,094
but shouldn't we wait
to do this, I don't know, the legal way?

637
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:54,130
While I was rebooting
the system I ran through the program logs

638
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,299
and checked it against
my private backup file.

639
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,770
The reason the system
crashed was because it wasn't the real system.

640
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,372
It was some shadow program

641
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,540
- built of top of the original.
- <i>( keys jangle )</i>

642
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,577
It was designed to hide
in the hard drives when we tried to fix it.

643
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:11,047
Are you telling me that
somebody tried to hack in from the outside?

644
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,216
Not that kind
of program, no.

645
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:16,686
This came from somebody who
had access to our entire system from the inside.

646
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:19,722
- Avery?
- Hardly, no.

647
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:23,626
Avery can barely pay his rent.
He would never put himself out of a job.

648
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:26,662
This came from
higher up.

649
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,845
I can't believe you
just tranked that guy.

650
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:44,013
I didn't know you
had it in you.

651
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:47,050
There's a lot of things
you didn't know about me, Nathan.

652
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,291
( gasps )
Sorry.

653
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,076
Dr. Collins,
I need an up-- where is she?

654
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,244
- Ladies' room.
- How long has she been gone?

655
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,847
- I don't know,
20 minutes, maybe. - 20 minutes?

656
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,016
Hey, chicks take forever
in the bathroom.

657
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,318
Idiot!

658
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,102
<i>( woman screams )</i>

659
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,270
<i>( woman #2 screams )</i>

00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,439
<i>( toilet flushes )</i>

661
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:59,489
This is Lawrence Van Allen
to the holding cell. Come in.

00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,525
<i>This is Lawrence Van Allen</i>
<i>to the guard holding</i> <i>Dr. Collins.</i>

663
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,261
<i>Do you copy?</i>

664
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,731
Holding cell, come in!

665
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,899
Do something!

666
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,985
My God.

667
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,720
What happened?
Where'd they go?

668
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,926
( grunts )

669
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,396
Put security
on full alert!

670
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,131
Find Dr. Collins.

671
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,866
Man:
<i>Which one?</i>

672
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,601
Both of them!

673
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:48,939
( grunts )

674
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,185
- Afternoon, Doc Collins.
- Hi, Mark.

675
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:05,221
It's so lovely today
I just thought I'd play hooky.

676
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:08,258
No problem, Doctor.
I just gotta check out your car.

677
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,860
- My car?
- Yeah, it's a new company policy.

678
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,029
I guess there's some stuff
that's gone missing

679
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:15,197
- from a couple of the labs.
- Really?

680
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:18,234
Yeah, I know, who'd
want to steal a couple of test tubes, huh?

681
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:22,138
Anyway, I gotta check
every vehicle that goes out of here.

682
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,175
It's not your fault
though.

683
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,343
Of course not.

684
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,283
- This is fine.
- Oh, good good.

685
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:36,019
- Well, have a nice day.
- Trunk too.

686
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,055
- The trunk?
- Yeah.

687
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:41,223
It's a real pain
in the butt, ma'am. Sorry.

688
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:42,959
Man on radio:
<i>Gate Security, come in.</i>

689
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:44,694
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

690
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:46,429
Look, I'm kind of
in a rush, you know,

691
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,597
to get to the beach
so I can work on my tan.

692
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,333
Could you just check
my trunk out first

693
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,501
- and then I'll get
out of your hair? - Yeah, sure.

694
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,104
I guess whatever
they're squawking about can wait a sec.

695
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,273
Thank you so much.
You're the best.

696
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,442
And just because of that,
I'm gonna give you the honor

697
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,610
of checking out my trunk.

698
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,816
What the hell?

699
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,852
Now, I know this looks
suspicious, uh...

700
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,588
( groans )

701
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,323
Nathan!

702
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:15,925
See, I bet there are
still things about me you don't know.

703
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:19,829
- Obviously you're right.
- <i>Hey, come on!</i>

704
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:56,632
- It's so pretty.
- Not as pretty as you.

705
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,801
Smooth.

706
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,838
- The water looks great.
- Uh-huh.

707
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,308
We should go
for a swim.

708
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,476
I didn't bring
my suit.

709
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,645
You don't
need a suit.

710
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:12,682
LC, are you crazy?
We can't just take off our clothes.

711
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,718
Why not?
There's nobody around.

712
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,454
Right now.
What if somebody comes?

713
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:20,924
So what if they do?
Besides, we'll be in the water.

714
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,092
So who's gonna know?

715
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,129
You're a very bad
influence on me, you know that?

716
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,731
If you're afraid to
do it, I understand.

717
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:32,202
- I'm not afraid.
- Oh yeah?

718
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,539
Hey, you did
bring your suit!

719
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,697
- Coming?
- Yeah.

720
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:03,433
What are
you doing?

721
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,469
This water's
cold, baby.

722
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,637
So who's afraid now?

723
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:12,107
What would I possibly
be afraid of?

724
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:47,243
You know, that was
my first kiss.

725
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:48,978
Really?

726
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,786
Where are
you going?

727
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,521
To the moon!

728
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,689
That was my
first kiss, too.

729
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:05,894
Well, ready or not,
here I come.

730
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:17,607
LC?

731
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,775
Very funny, LC.

732
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,017
Shark!
Shark!

733
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,619
Come on, I've been
called worse.

734
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,355
Oh my God!

735
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,562
Come on!

736
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,077
Okay, keep your eyes open.
If you see anybody--

737
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,679
cops, security,
anybody-- take off.

738
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,415
No, I'm not gonna
leave you.

739
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:07,150
I was hoping you'd
say that.

740
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,318
Hang tight,
be right back.

741
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,560
Hello, is this
the Coast Guard?

742
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,897
Okay good.  I need
to speak to whoever's in charge of...

743
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:24,934
well, sharks.

744
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:29,272
Okay, I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but, uh...

745
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:33,609
My name?
That's not important.

746
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:37,080
What's important is that
you need to send your boats out right now

747
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,682
armed with everything
you've got.

748
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,850
<i>Why?</i>

749
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,019
<i>Because...</i>

750
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,490
because there are half
a dozen government-grown killer sharks

751
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,092
on the hunt along
the beaches of this city.

752
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:53,563
And unless your people
take action right now a lot of people are going to die.

753
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,201
Hello?

754
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,238
<i>Aw, don't do this.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

755
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:05,708
Hey, I'm serious here!
Hello!

756
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,876
Goddamn bureaucrats!

757
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,479
Shit!

758
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:13,516
Marla!

759
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,251
- Change for a 20?
- No!

760
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,419
Hey!

761
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,588
You guys got change
for a 20?

762
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,492
Thank you.

763
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,661
Unbelievable.

764
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:28,264
Un-believable!

765
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,866
- So how'd it go
with the Coast Guard? - Not great.

766
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,903
- Well, I got something
better, this. - Which is?

767
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,373
The prototype to the Blue
Demon command program.

768
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,108
Now, it's a rough version,
but it might work.

769
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:42,144
The signal might
be a little weak,

770
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:45,615
but if I can tap into
the lab's transmitter and then into this--

771
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,783
You're going
to try to control

772
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,519
six sharks
with your laptop,

773
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,989
a cell phone
and a car radio?

774
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:56,025
That's your problem, Nathan.
You're always so negative.

775
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:57,760
- Negative?
- Negative, yes, negative.

776
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,362
You might try seeing the cup
half full for a change.

777

Well, don't let our
little emergency

787
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,305
come between you
and your Twinkies!

788
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,908
How much longer before
the reboot is complete?

789
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:48,076
Should be
any minute now.

790
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:50,679
Whoa!
Wait a sec.

791
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,848
- What now?
- There's another signal here.

792
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:55,017
Somebody's tapped into
the command frequency.

793
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:58,054
- They're trying to communicate
with the sharks. - It's them.

794
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:01,090
Looks like they're using
a phone line to hack into the system.

795
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,825
Probably
a cell phone.

796
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,993
Can you track the signal,
find out where they are?

797
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,596
Yeah, I guess.

798
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,332
But that's like
totally illegal.

799
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,368
Hello!
Government.

800
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,970
That's what we do.
Find them!

801
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,514
Not cool.

802
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:57,013
- Anything?
- Still searching for a signal.

803
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:59,615
Look, maybe you're right.
Maybe this is a stupid idea.

804
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,783
Hey, don't say that.

805
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:04,386
- Why not?  It's what
you're thinking anyway. - No it's not.

806
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,989
It's okay, Nathan.
I'm a big girl, I can take it.

807
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,157
I was thinking
you're the smartest wom--

808
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,797
you're the smartest
human being I've ever met.

809
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:17,399
It's what attracted me
to you in the first place.

810
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,568
Really?

811
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,304
Yeah, really.

812
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:23,472
I thought
it was my ass.

813
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:26,943
Well, okay, maybe it was
a little bit your ass.

814
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:34,750
I watch you,
you know?

815
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,353
When you work.

816
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:41,256
and you get that far away
look in your eyes,

817
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,293
and I wonder

818
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:48,630
what it must be like
to be in there with you.

819
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:56,873
What was that thing

820
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:59,041
that you were gonna tell me
before all this started?

821
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,209
Okay, um--

822
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,945
<i>( computer beeping )</i>

823
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,113
I got a signal!
I found them!

824
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,849
Oh my God.

825
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:10,752
Okay, they breached the lake.
They're in the ocean.

826
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:14,223
- They're still traveling
in a group formation. - Where are they?

827
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:17,693
Well, according to this,

828
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:19,428
just a few miles ahead.

829
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:22,464
Okay good, this is
a nice desolate area.

830
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,501
Let's just hope they find
a nice long, lonely beach

831
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,669
with nobody around
for miles.

832
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:48,057
- This is not good.
- No it's not.  The noise, the splashing,

833
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:50,225
this is like ringing a dinner
bell for our sharks.

834
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:51,961
You've gotten
your signal, right?

835
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:54,563
You can send the command
and get them to return to the compound.

836
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:58,034
If the uplink
to the main transmitter holds, then I--

837
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:01,504
- Nathan, I'm just not sure.
- Hey!  Think positive.

838
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,239
Give it a shot.

839
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:06,709
- What are you doing?
- I didn't have much luck with the Coast Guard.

840
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:09,745
Let's see if I can convince
these kids I'm not crazy.

841
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:24,059
Have you actually seen
these sharks around here?

842
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:27,530
No, not exactly,
but we've been tracking them from down the coast.

843
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,132
My wife-- well,
my ex-wife,

844
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:31,867
she's in the car
with a computer...

845
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,036
- ( sighs )
- ...trying to send a signal to them

846
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,638
- with her cell phone--
- Okay, look, Doctor...

847
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,374
- Collins.
- Dr. Collins.

848
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,410
I know you're probably
under a lot of stress,

849
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,578
but they have laws against
drinking on the beach.

850
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:47,917
Drinking alone,
that is.

01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:57,319
Come on!
Everybody out!

861
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,055
Hey, come on!

862
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:02,091
There are sharks in the water.
What are you doing? Come here!

863
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:04,259
Come on!
Hey, come here!

864
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,862
( sobbing )

865
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:28,984
Dr. Collins, look out!

866
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:40,696
( alarm sounding )

867
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,431
- Fuck it!

868
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:53,642
Hi.

869
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,678
Hi.

870
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,980
How do you feel?

871
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:03,185
Okay, I guess.

872
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,088
My leg's
a little itchy.

873
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,294
What the hell?

874
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,198
No!

875
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,800
Oh, God, no!

876
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,271
No!

877
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:23,572
Bad dream?

878
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:27,475
Oh, God,
okay.

879
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,585
What happened?

880
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:38,320
I um...

881
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,488
overloaded
the signal.

882
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,657
Blew the chips.

883
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,826
They're dead?

884
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:50,465
Oh God, Marla,
I'm sorry.

885
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:52,634
This project...

886
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:54,803
those sharks
were your life.

887
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:59,574
They used to be.

888
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,250
Good, you're up.

889
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,720
That'll save me having
to repeat myself.

890
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,190
Lawrence, I think
this can wait until after Nathan gets some rest.

891
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:18,227
I had six very expensive
sharks at the start of this.

892
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:20,395
I now have none.

893
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:22,131
Somebody has to pay.

894
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:23,432
Take a hike, Larry.

895
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,372
- Four.
- What?

896
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:32,974
There were only four
sharks at the beach.

897
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:34,710
I only saw four.

898
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,445
Are you sure?

899
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,613
Trust me, it's not
something I would forget.

900
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:44,686
This is Van Allen.
How many carcasses did you retrieve?

901
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:47,289
I see.
And did you--

902
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:51,192
Thank you.

903
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:57,266
Four.
Another one dead from an overzealous fisherman.

904
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,868
No sign of the sixth
one anywhere.

905
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:03,339
Okay, they've
been traveling

906
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:05,074
in school formation
all along.

907
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:07,676
What would finally
make them separate?

908
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,580
Maybe they didn't.

909
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,182
Maybe they
were never together in the first place.

910
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,460
Hey, guys, great job
with the sharks!

911
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,629
I heard all about it.
You guys deserve a medal.

912
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,365
Stuff it, Avery.

913
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:31,967
- What are you doing?
- Look at this.

914
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:34,135
Wha--
how'd that happen?

915
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:43,245
- Says it's real time.
- But it's not monitoring anything at all.

916
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:46,715
- This is a program
he made, a decoy. - To throw us off track.

917
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:50,185
You guys don't know
what you're talking about. You know they're dangerous.

918
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,222
You were after them!
They're terrorists!

919
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:56,692
All right, "dude,"
where's my shark?

920
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:01,029
I believe I can answer
that question for you.

921
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,632
Ah, General.
We didn't expect to see you.

922
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:04,933
( gun cocks )

923
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:09,270
Everybody up
against the wall.

924
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,115
Not you, Dashlow.

925
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:22,717
Oh, yeah.

926
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,188
General, I'm not
sure I understand.

927
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:29,657
Of course you don't
understand, Van Allen.

928
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,128
Because you're nothing
more than a patsy.

929
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:39,634
This whole thing--
the computer shutdown,

930
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:43,105
the sharks' escape--
it was all you.

931
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:44,406
He had a little help.

932
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,574
Why, Avery?

933
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,177
You can't buy Porsches
with dreams.

934
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:51,346
The money.
Duh!

935
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:55,683
Why would you sabotage
something like this?

936
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:58,286
You're a patriot,
for God's sake!

937
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:01,323
That's exactly why,
because I am a patriot.

938
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,395
This government
of ours is weak.

939
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:10,432
We were doing okay
for a while there.

940
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:13,468
We had our
heads on straight about terrorism.

941
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:16,505
But now they're starting
to divert money into social programs,

942
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:18,673
schools, the homeless,
the poor.

943
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:22,577
Before you know it
our military won't be more than a couple of Boy Scouts

944
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:24,313
walking around
carrying penknives.

945
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:26,915
Well it's not gonna
happen on my watch!

946
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:32,554
Then I thought
this shark of yours...

947
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:35,156
well, now if he can
defuse a bomb,

948
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:36,892
he sure as hell
can deliver one.

949
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:39,060
Red Dog.

950
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:42,097
Smartest in the class.

951
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,941
( grunts )

952
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:55,109
- World record!
- Nice toss.

953
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:59,013
( groans )

954
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:01,182
I'm going to get him.

955
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,785
No no come back!
Forget about him!

956
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:05,521
We need to find
Red Dog.

957
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,689
He said it
could plant a bomb. Is that possible?

958
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:10,726
If he's programmed
it outside our system, anything's possible.

959
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:12,894
Okay, they probably have
a separate lab

960
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,497
somewhere else
with a control program tapped into ours.

961
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,665
- Avery.
- Avery.

962
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:25,907
Cheap, just like
I suspected.

963
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:34,549
( engine starts )

964
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:38,453
Where are you
going, Avery?

965
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:40,622
Come here, you
lousy punk!

966
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:08,383
Avery's been doing
his homework.

967
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:10,986
Okay.

968
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:13,154
- <i>( keyboards clicking )</i>
- <i>( computer beeping )</i>

969
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,528
Charming.

970
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:23,565
Okay, this is the original
command program

971
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,167
and that is the shadow
program that he created.

972
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:32,674
And here's our
missing shark.

973
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:38,313
It's Red Dog.

974
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:43,518
Whoa whoa!
What is that?

975
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:46,989
I don't know.
It's reading on the image.

976
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,230
Oh my God.
Plutonium.

977
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:00,001
It's the Russian
suitcase bomb.

978
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:02,170
Remora bought it
for himself.

979
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,641
What's the target?

980
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:06,942
Somewhere further
up the coast.

981
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:09,110
I'm just getting
the coordinates now.

982
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,269
I'll just bring it
up here on the map.

983
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,004
And I'll try
to reprogram Red Dog.

984
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:39,907
You can't try, Marla.
You can do it.

985
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:42,510
Okay, and it should
be right there.

986
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,282
Oh my God!

987
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:52,053
( groans )

988
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:58,994
Thanks to you
Remora's not gonna pay.

989
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:02,030
But I bet somebody else
will for that.

990
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,669

Hello, this is Lawrence
Van Allen calling.

1009
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:29,064
Yes, I was wondering,
is that teaching position at the university still open?

1010
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:30,799
Yes I'll hold.

1011
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:33,401
You can forget about
that tenure of yours, Van Allen.

1012
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:34,702
I'll make sure
of that.

1013
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:36,438
Another trumped-up
charge, General?

1014
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,173
I don't think so.

1015
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:41,643
It's you alone who will
be counting ceiling tiles at Leavenworth.

1016
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:45,113
I've been through three wars,
two invasions

1017
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:46,848
and one hell
of a skirmish.

1018

1035
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:15,470
that you were
gonna tell me?

1036
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,638
Oh right, that.
Um...

1037
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:20,241
Yeah, that, uh...
so, what do you say?

1038
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:23,712
Right here, right now,
before flag and country,

1039
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,748
what was it?

1040
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,351
The divorce papers.

1041
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:32,387
Yeah?

1042
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,291
I didn't file them.

1043
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:42,797
Oh.

1044
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:45,399
Are you mad?

1045
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,870
I mean, after everything
that we've been through,

1046
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:50,605
I guess, I could
still go and--

1047
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:57,545
Remember you
dropped this?

1048
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:05,352
Want to see if
it still fits?

1049
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,571
Perfect.

1050
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,826
God, I missed that ass!

1051
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,332
Come on, kids.

1052
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:57,839
<i>They're waiting.</i>

1053
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,226
Senator:
<i>All right, Dr. Collins,</i>

1054
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:19,961
<i>why don't you all start</i>
<i>at the beginning.</i>

1055
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:22,129
<i>Tell us how</i>
<i>this all happened.</i>

1056
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:25,166
Marla:
<i>As you know, Senator, with</i> <i>the airways relatively safe</i>

1057
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,334
<i>it was time to begin</i>
<i>covertly securing</i>

1058
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:29,503
<i>our oceans and waterways.</i>

1059
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,672
<i>It started out</i>
<i>as an experiment.</i>

1060
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,841
<i>The first change</i>
<i>was in the eyes.</i>

1061
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:35,577
<i>The iris separated</i>
<i>from the pupil</i>

1062
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:37,312
<i>and it followed</i>
<i>movement</i>

1063
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:38,613
<i>like a motion</i>
<i>detector.</i>

1064
01:23:38,613 --> 01:23:41,215
<i>I'd watch them</i>
<i>hours on end</i>

1065
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:43,384
<i>and when they'd see me</i>
<i>they'd stare back,</i>

1066
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:45,987
<i>unblinking,</i>
<i>unemotional.</i>

1067
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:48,155
<i>Sometimes I swear</i>
<i>they were laughing at me.</i>

1068
01:23:48,156 --> 01:23:51,192
<i>We didn't mean for things</i>
<i>to go as far as they did,</i>

1069
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:53,360
<i>but in a world that's</i>
<i>mostly covered with water</i>

1070
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,963
<i>we needed a new</i>
<i>kind of defense.</i>

1071
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:58,132
<i>Just another fish</i>
<i>in the sea.</i>

1072
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:00,301
<i>But we made</i>
<i>a horrible mistake.</i>

1073
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:02,903
<i>We meant to take the next</i>
<i>step in evolution,</i>

1074
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:06,807
<i>but we created</i>
<i>a monster.</i>

1075
01:24:06,808 --> 01:24:08,109
Senator:
<i>I see.</i>

1076
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:09,844
<i>And would you say</i>
<i>it was possible</i>

1077
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:12,012
<i>for this sort of thing</i>
<i>to happen again?</i>

1078
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:16,784
Honestly, Senator,
I don't know.
