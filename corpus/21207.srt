1
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,664
Hey, Simon. Look at Freddy fly!

2
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,625
Interpol doesn't pay us to fly.
They pay us for surveillance.

3
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,465
Simon, why do European police
call themselves lnterpol, anyway?

4
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,342
Why don't they just say " Europol"?

5
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,542
I had a Euro pulled once.
I couldn't sit for a week.

6
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,624
Cut the chatter. I'm in position.
Are you ready yet?

7
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,429
One second.

8
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,626
We're working out some bugs, man.

9
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,226
Got it.

10
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,268
If it isn't Ashton,
our favourite arms dealer.

11
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,024
Pull back so we can see
who he's waiting for.

12
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,544
I got it.

13
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,182
Lose them, you idiot!

14
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,189
Guys, will you just land
the damn thing?

15
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,104
There. Got it!

16
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,659
Who is the man? Who is the man?

17
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,949
I got static on the audio.

18
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,579
But that picture's better
than my cable at home.

19
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,821
You being a little critical,
don't you think?

20
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,425
Interpol doesn't just need pictures.
They need sound.

21
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,860
-That man has a point.
-He's the man.

22
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,304
-You the man.
-No, you.

23
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,943
No, guys.
This must be the man.

24
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,866
All right, guys.

25
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,703
It's game time.

26
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,588
Who do we have here?

27
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,988
Whoever he is, they're really
mad at his car.

28
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,107
Are you mad at me?
It's been three days.

29
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,102
You don't call. You don't E-mail.

30
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,545
You don't carrier pigeon.
What did I do?

31
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,467
The deal is cancelled.
The weapon isn't for sale.

32
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,305
I think you'd better run that
by me again, colonel.

33
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,063
What do you mean, "cancelled"?

34
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,902
I've changed my mind.

35
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,265
Can't you guys get closer?

36
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,989
Does the Pope wear a funny hat?

37
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,148
I hate people who renege on deals.

38
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,982
I hate cowards who act tough.

39
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,381
I hate colonels who think they're
generals. And I hate bugs!

40
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,301
-What happened?
-They killed the fly.

41
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,346
Freddy's dead?!

42
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,309
What?! What kind of man
kills another man's fly?

43
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,867
Enough of this silliness, colonel.

44
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,670
Let's talk family.

45
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,662
Don't bring my family into this.

46
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,420
Don't make me.

47
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,783
By the way, Colonel Telore...

48
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,706
...Mother taught me to always leave
a lasting impression.

49
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,659
You all right?

50
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,339
What business is it of yours?
Who are you?

51
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,943
The guy that saved your ass.

52
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,027
When did lnterpol start hiring
sideshow freaks?

53
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,659
When did you start doing business
with arms dealers?

54
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,188
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.

55
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,307
Come on, colonel.
I see this all the time.

56
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,103
Guy gets greedy.

57
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,147
Guy meets Ashton.

58
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,383
Guy gets dead!

59
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,700
Call me...

60
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,622
...when you're ready to talk.

61
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,226
You okay?

62
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,869
What happened?

63
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,378
I scratched my bike, man.

64
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,906
The bike, I can fix. What happened
to the guy in uniform?

65
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,744
I called him a cab.
Could you l.D. him?

66
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,584
The guy's name is
Colonel Jacques Telore.

67
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,145
This file ended two years ago.
What's he doing now?

68
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,501
-Right now?
-He's getting ready for bed.

69
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,302
Nice warm glass of milk.

70
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,184
-Some flannel pj's.
-Hopefully a prayer.

71
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,904
And some sweet, sweet loving--

72
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,027
Guys, please.

73
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,183
His current assignment is classified.
Interpol doesn't have access.

74
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,063
-Why did I hire you guys, anyway?
-You hired us because we are cool.

75
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,498
And we bad!

76
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,342
And we can dance.

77
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,583
See, got you smiling.

78
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,183
Here, check this out.

79
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,748
Come on, man!

80
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,705
If we weren't monks, we'd be
on the road.

81
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,226
You think he mad?

82
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,859
-He's very moody.
-We still getting paid?

83
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,106
Vow of poverty,
but we're getting paid.

84
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,459
I'm hungry.

85
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,063
I thought you was on a diet?

86
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,665
Screw the diet.
Let's get Chinese food.

87
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,261
-How was that?
-That was great.

88
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,188
How's this?

89
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,384
Oh, God!

90
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,059
I'm sorry, Mr. Gabrielli.

91
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,220
That's all right, Claire.

92
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,347
Sometimes I scare myself.

93
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,340
Are you having fun?

94
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,023
Yes! Beaucoup de fun!

95
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,544
Let's go for a swim.

96
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,746
You can't!

97
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,739
Why not?

98
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,947
I mean, are you wearing sun block?

99
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,459
Stay where I can see you.

100
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,029
We're going to the raft.

101
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,340
Stay on the raft where
I can see you.

102
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,229
God, your father's being
so weird today.

103
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,225
It's your shot.
Make it and we win.

104
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,665
Simon says, "Go for it!"

105
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,667
What's up? What's this game called?
" Hit the Cat"?

106
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,260
Come on! Don't you remember?
Nick Miranda.

107
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,579
You believe this?

108
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,900
Yes! Come here!

109
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,738
Talk about a walk down memory lane!
Don't you remember?

110
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,141
Langley, '92? We sat across from
each other in ballistics.

111
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,664
I remember.

112
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,585
I used to play with your detonators.
What are you doing here?

113
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,423
Come on, man. I live here.

114
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,424
You're kidding. You still working
for the company?

115
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,501
You know, the CIA?

116
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,503
No. I retired.

117
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,468
Well, you picked a great place.

118
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,099
Do you believe it?
I get off a plane, go for a walk...

119
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,988
...and who do I run into?

120
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,868
Give your old buddy Nick a hug!

121
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,901
You have issues
about hugging another man?

122
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,266
This is France.
Men kiss each other here.

123
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,863
Give me a hug!

124
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,985
Easy! You're killing me here!

125
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,348
I'm going to the beach to meet
this guy. Come with me.

126
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,184
We could catch up on old times.
I'll buy lunch.

127
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,341
No, thanks. I'm full.

128
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,424
Buddy, relax. It's a figure of speech.
Come on, hang out with me!

129
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,662
It'll be fun! It'll take two hours
out of your day.

130
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,186
What's the big deal?

131
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,059
All right.

132
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,025
What's your name again?

133
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,068
Nick Miranda!

134
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,627
So after that, I did two years
in San Antonio...

135
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,384
...working the smuggling rings for DEA.

136
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,423
So you worked for Sanders?

137
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,819
Sanders?

138
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,025
What a ball-buster he was!

139
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,982
Sanders was a woman.

140
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,261
You didn't know?

141
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,627
-Know what?
-About the operation.

142
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,060
Almost killed him--
Her. Him, her, whatever.

143
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,660
The hormones, the mood swings.
It was like working for Chewbacca:

144
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,859
Morning, boss--!

145
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,140
I couldn't hang. I got bored
with it, so here I am...

146
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,860
...head of security for
a software firm. Not bad, huh?

147
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,504
We're talking here!

148
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,383
-For wife!
-No, no. We're talking here.

149
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,018
I collect wooden cows.

150
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,226
Let's cut the bullshit. Okay, Nick?

151
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,823
-Tell me all about the guy.
-What guy?

152
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,544
The guy you came to meet.

153
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,463
Just a five-minutes-and-we're-
out-of-here kind of guy.

154
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,786
I don't see what
you're testy about.

155
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,589
This must be the guy.

156
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,506
This is Nick.

157
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,462
Who's the tall one?
You're supposed to be alone.

158
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,860
He's here to make
sure everything goes smooth.

159
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,261
You were supposed to come alone.
Step out where I can see you.

160
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,863
We do things my way.

161
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,589
Give my man the briefcase.

162
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,940
You don't get the ransom
until I see Claire.

163
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,225
What's going on?

164
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,381
My friend wants to know
what's going on.

165
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,268
Give my man the briefcase!

166
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,388
When we know you've delivered,
we'll give you the girl.

167
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,740
You show me the girl,
I show you the case!

168
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,379
All right! She's on the raft
in the water.

169
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,987
Is this a joke? She's not there!

170
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,902
Who do you think you're messing with?

171
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,589
Look, guys, guys....

172
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,585
Chill out.

173
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,660
Chill out.

174
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,981
Give them the briefcase.

175
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,338
No way!

176
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,022
Man! My cardio's for shit!
I gotta get back on the StairMaster.

177
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,620
Tell me what's going on,
before I rearrange your face!

178
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,909
My boss's daughter was kidnapped.
I need your help to get her back.

179
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,940
What's inside?

180
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,699
Shit! lncoming!

181
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,228
Hey, baby. Long time, no see.

182
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,064
Give me the briefcase
and we'll keep it that way.

183
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,544
You know this chick?

184
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,541
I called, but
your number's disconnected.

185
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,463
I moved. Get over it.
Give me the briefcase!

186
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,389
I gotta keep it, but I'd love to
know why everybody wants it.

187
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,501
-That's not gonna happen.
-Which part?

188
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,506
Both!

189
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,304
Easy, Flashdance! Game over!

190
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,380
You got moves?

191
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,464
I got moves! Don't let me
get all Jurassic on your ass.

192
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,743
Come on, come on.

193
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,427
Can we just hook up later
and talk about this?

194
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,308
I've got nothing to say!

195
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,265
You okay--?

196
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,902
How about we go out for a drink?

197
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,427
Well, then, how about a swim?

198
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,104
Suit yourself.

199
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,303
Why did you wake me? I was dreaming
I was with Drew Barrymore.

200
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,302
We were having
a mad game of Monopoly.

201
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,269
What's this?

202
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,746
Puff Daddy?

203
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,746
Cute.

204
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,985
Where's the money?

205
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,549
There was nothing there.

206
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,427
Bullshit! There was $2 million!
What'd you do with it?!

207
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,389
Do you think I'd bring your
skinny ass back to my place...

208
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,546
...if I stole $2 million from you?

209
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,428
Then where is it?

210
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,739
Did you see the money?

211
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,266
No, but it was a whole
hell of a lot heavier than one CD.

212
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,459
I wonder why.

213
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,019
Shit!

214
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,187
My dear Mr. Gabrielli,
do you have the disk?

215
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,102
They didn't bring the disk.

216
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,749
Maybe I should send help!

217
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,265
No! I don't need your help.

218
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,900
I'll handle it my way with my people.
I'll get you the disk.

219
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,466
All right, but just hurry up.

220
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,341
We have to set up a second exchange.

221
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,503
Tell him you can't go through with it.
She's only a child.

222
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,263
I have to go through with it.

223
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,110
It's Claire or Michael.

224
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,301
You don't have Claire?

225
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,780
It's not my fault.
They didn't bring her.

226
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,941
That's actually a good thing...

227
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,744
...because the case only had
a CD and bricks in it.

228
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,548
I told you not to open it!

229
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,220
I didn't open it. I didn't open it.

230
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,505
I dropped it.

231
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,787
Give them the briefcase
and bring me back my daughter!

232
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,630
-Now do you understand me?
-Yes, sir.

233
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,900
He wants me to give them the CD.

234
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,744
Of course he does.

235
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,024
Stay here.

236
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,586
No way!

237
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,741
Hold on. I need that!

238
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,820
I gotta take it to Fence.
I'm talking here! I need the disk!

239
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,504
I said stay here!

240
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,021
"Stay here." What am l,
like your dog now?

241
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,581
Man, this is some
serious classified shit.

242
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,783
Where'd you get it from?

243
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,026
From him.

244
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,619
Well, " him" has some
explaining to do!

245
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,940
We need to get him down here now.

246
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,540
Please, God,
I need to get that disk.

247
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,423
If you help me out...

248
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,629
...l swear I will straighten out
my act. No more lying.

249
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,027
No more-- No more nothing!

250
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,109
I swear to God-- To you!
I swear to you.

251
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,789
Nick!

252
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,540
What's up, Nick?
It's me, God!

253
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,428
I'm chilling up in heaven.

254
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,823
God wants you to roll over to
the confessional booth.

255
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,148
I've done nothing wrong.
I've got nothing to confess.

256
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,224
Come on, Nick. You and I
both know that that's not true.

257
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,904
Now roll over
to the confessional booth.

258
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,464
-But first--
-Make him jump.

259
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,428
God wants you to jump!

260
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,099
Why?

261
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,948
Are you questioning God?

262
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,779
Jump higher!
God wants you to jump higher!

263
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,902
There you go.
Now raise the roof.

264
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,420
Now God wants you to dance, Nick.

265
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,389
Do the Running Man, Nick.
Do the Running Man.

266
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,581
No, that's the Cabbage Patch!

267
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,186
You watch Soul Train.
Do the Running Man! Say, "Go Jesus!"

268
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,789
Go Jesus, go.

269
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,788
Go Jesus, go Jesus, go!

270
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,828
Now breakdown! Go, Nick!

271
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,024
Say, "oy, oy!"

272
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,229
God wants you to kneel
and crawl to the confessional booth.

273
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,300
Crawl, Nick. There you go.

274
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,423
There you go!

275
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,104
I'm here!
What do you want me to do now?

276
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,585
Now you die!

277
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,703
That hurt!

278
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,702
Oh, God!

279
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,503
Help!

280
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,025
-Who are you guys?
-We're monks.

281
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,907
Monks of death!

282
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,139
I don't wanna die!

283
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,029
I think he's ready to talk.

284
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,740
You think?

285
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,028
They're shooting! Shooting at me!

286
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,709
This is classified U.S.
military software.

287
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,987
Why do you have this?

288
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,109
Who knew I had it? I was supposed
to have $2 million!

289
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,499
Who are you guys?

290
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,345
My name is Brother Macro,
a.k.a. " Big Mac."

291
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,741
And I'm Brother Micro,
a.k.a. " Free Willy."

292
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,307
They work for me.
And you're in my office.

293
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,660
Why didn't you tell me?
You could've told me!

294
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,787
Could you figure out what this does?

295
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,580
Nick's boss must've developed it
for the Department of Defence.

296
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,584
His database is encrypted.
It'll take me a day to crack it.

297
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,219
I need that disk
to get my boss's daughter back!

298
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,459
The disk stays here!

299
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,270
She dies if I don't make
the exchange!

300
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,587
She lives because
we are going to get her back.

301
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,429
Did you say "we"?

302
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,659
We.

303
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,140
Like me and you, "we"?

304
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,389
Did I stutter?

305
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,180
All we have to do
is come up with a plan.

306
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,423
No, I will work on the plan.
You will set up the second meet.

307
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,824
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

308
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,980
-You know what today is?
-What?

309
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,830
Six days before we never
see each other again.

310
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,300
Come on, Claire. I will ask him.

311
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,541
-I promise you.
-When?

312
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,781
Soon. When it's the right time.

313
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,304
What if I ask him?

314
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,462
If he says no, then we'll run away.

315
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:25,381
It's not that simple.
It's important to me that he approves.

316
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,223
I know it's a big deal.

317
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,700
But isn't the point
of an exchange program...

318
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,145
...to go to a new school
for a semester...

319
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,219
...meet the girl of your dreams
and transfer permanently?

320
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:45,139
I had to beg him all year
to let me go for three months.

321
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,348
I like it when you beg.

322
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,509
Then I beg you to be patient.

323
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,184
We will always be together.
I promise you.

324
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,382
He will understand.

325
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,624
Who will understand?

326
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,259
You will. You'll understand what
an incredible time I've been having.

327
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,826
And you shall continue
to have an incredible time.

328
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,903
I've set up a private tasting
at the winery tomorrow.

329
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,220
We're on.

330
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,462
It goes down outside a wine-tasting
room in Gourdon. You know it?

331
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,065
I know it. Let's go.

332
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,228
It's a little too retro for me,
but it's cherry. Where'd you get it?

333
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,108
The brothers hooked me up.

334
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,306
Those boys are whacked.

335
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,020
Wait a minute. We're going into battle.
We need a theme.

336
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,744
-A theme?
-Yeah, something to get us pumped!

337
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,341
That's good.

338
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,264
I like that.

339
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,823
I am in position. You cool?

340
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,908
I'm cool. Do you see anybody?

341
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,621
I see your ex.
You wanna tell me about her?

342
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,861
Can we talk about this
some other time?

343
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,943
This is a big deal.
You got what we call " low self-esteem."

344
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,828
You got to pick yourself up!

345
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,779
Live a little.
You're a good-looking guy!

346
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,540
What?

347
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,303
Just stick to the plan, okay?

348
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,903
Can you handle that?

349
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,505
Are you kidding?
I am bad to the bone, bubba!

350
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,628
I got it. I got it.

351
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,063
Lookie! For your wife.

352
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,979
Make the call.

353
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,339
I'm all over it.

354
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,824
It's me. I'm early.
Let's do the deal.

355
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,866
Who's "me"?

356
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,021
The guy you mixed it up with
at the beach.

357
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,858
Your voice got higher.

358
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,025
It did?

359
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,625
Not Simon.
The other one. Nick.

360
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,224
Time to sleep!

361
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,866
All right, Nick.
Let's get down to business.

362
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,385
Fine.
Bring Claire where I can see her.

363
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,190
Can't do that. But I can let you
see her through a window.

364
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,346
What window?

365
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,148
The window of the cellar.

366
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,666
So she's in the cellar.
She's in the cellar?

367
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,463
Good. Keep stalling.

368
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,663
What do you think of my friend Simon?

369
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,138
Not much.

370
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,427
I happen to know that
Simon's got a crush on you.

371
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,623
Can we talk about this later?

372
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,829
When? Me and Simon are talking about
it later. Maybe we can talk together.

373
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,467
I'm losing my patience.
Stop playing games.

374
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,826
First, get her away from the building.

375
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,059
How do I do that?

376
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,299
How do you do what?

377
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,544
How do I stop playing games?

378
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,020
Tell her to move
up the alley to her left.

379
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,103
I want you to move
up the alley to your left.

380
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,339
Why?

381
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,229
To meet on neutral ground
where she can't screw with you.

382
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,938
To meet on neutral ground
where I can screw you!

383
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,186
What?!

384
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,579
Where you can screw me!

385
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,786
I mean, where you can't screw with--!

386
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,387
Move up the alley to the left,
or the deal is off!

387
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,858
That's right. That's right.

388
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,624
Now move to your right!
To your right!

389
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,780
Not to her right!

390
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,748
Do something!
She's right on top of me!

391
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,709
Up here! Up here!

392
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,865
Up here!

393
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,179
Claire is outside!
She is outside!

394
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,788
-I'm on it.
-I'm coming to you.

395
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,624
What are you doing here?

396
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,024
Making sure you get job done.

397
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,066
Job this!

398
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,261
I get jealous
when you fight other guys.

399
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,869
I'm immune to the sweet talk!

400
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,664
I give you this and I walk away.

401
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,502
Just give me the disk!

402
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,388
-I'm here to help!
-Let me go!

403
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,508
Just doing my job, man.

404
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,986
Jump, Claire!

405
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,344
Claire, come here!

406
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,579
Let's go!

407
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,502
She's on the other side
of the car!

408
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,229
We gotta call the cops!

409
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,141
I wouldn't have to gag you
if you'd stop fighting me!

410
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,625
Watch your head.

411
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,468
-They're right on our ass!
-I know! Just get down!

412
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,462
Stay down! They're firing!

413
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,063
Why did you gag her?

414
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,823
She wouldn't shut up!

415
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,583
A potato! A damn potato?!

416
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,105
I tried grapes,
but she kept eating them!

417
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,262
Thank God she's
not in the trunk!

418
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,869
Excuse us! Major gun battle
coming through here!

419
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,749
Do you see that freaking bus?!

420
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,543
I see it! Lean left!

421
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,944
I love this car, man!

422
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:00,309
They're like my college loan officers!
They keep coming!

423
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,223
Maybe he wants some Grey Poupon!

424
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,903
Just shut up and lean right!

425
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,062
You got the bulletproof bottom
option on there?

426
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,229
Enough tilting! You got
a cloaking device on this?

427
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,739
Nice talking to you!

428
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,749
Put your seat belt on!

429
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,982
Now you're worried about safety?

430
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,339
It doesn't work!

431
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,429
You see that cliff?

432
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,426
I see it!

433
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,545
-Which way should I lean?
-Don't lean. Hold on!

434
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,026
Oh, my God!

435
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,746
This is not happening!

436
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,220
Shit! Shit! Shit!

437
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,984
Can't you get a ticket for this?
Don't move!

438
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,460
Don't shake the car!
I'm afraid of heights!

439
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,343
I can see my house.

440
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,304
The red one?!

441
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,862
Caucasians!

442
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,860
I work for your dad.
We've rescued you.

443
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,065
You what?!

444
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,868
From your kidnappers.
We've rescued you!

445
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,304
What are you talking about?

446
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,018
The people holding you for ransom.

447
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,180
What people?!

448
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,386
I don't know!
The woman at the winery!

449
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,020
Are you insane? She works for my
boyfriend's father, you idiot!

450
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,226
-What's his name?
-Who?

451
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,465
Your boyfriend's father.

452
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,463
Bernard Gabrielli.
Who the hell are you?

453
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,430
What's she talking about?
She was kidnapped! You were there!

454
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,547
You're right. I was kidnapped.

455
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,906
-There, you see!
-By you two freaks!

456
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,222
Everything is under control.
She's safe. She's right here.

457
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,585
Thank God. Put her on.

458
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,746
Daddy?

459
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,429
Honey, it's okay.
You're safe now.

460
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,625
You're amazing!

461
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,905
What are you talking about?

462
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:52,142
I know you don't approve of Michael,
but I love him!

463
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,062
What's this got to do with Michael?

464
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:57,985
I can't believe you'd go this far
to keep us from being together!

465
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,185
She's suffering from what we like
to call " post-traumatic stress."

466
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,342
-What should I do with her?
-Just take her to the hotel.

467
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,989
I'll be there in the morning.

468
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,025
He wants me to bring her
to the hotel.

469
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,147
Good. Do you think you
can handle that?

470
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,028
I'll need the disk to take to Fence.

471
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,507
It stays here. If Gabrielli would
trade her life for it...

472
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,665
...l want to know why.

473
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,698
Michael's father was going
to kill me over computer software?

474
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,307
Here's everything you wanted to know
about Bernard Gabrielli.

475
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,381
The guy's sort of a populist hero.

476
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,428
He's an old-style don who leads
a bunch of fanatics...

477
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,900
...trying to get France out of Corsica.

478
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,825
Cute. Pictures of Chelsea Clinton.

479
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,384
Give me that!

480
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:46,780
Why would a guy like Gabrielli
need guidance software?

481
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,983
-Ashton's man was at the winery.
-Sampling Beaujolais?

482
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,228
Ashton and Gabrielli
have to be doing a deal.

483
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,347
If Ashton is doing a deal,
we'll know about it.

484
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,739
We're all over that guy!

485
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,787
He won't cough
without us giving him a cough drop!

486
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,630
Or sneeze
without us handing him a Kleenex!

487
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,065
Because we're
the doctors of surveillance!

488
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,187
And the doctors are in the house!

489
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,301
-We in the house!
-Yes, doctor!

490
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,268
Doctor, check my pulse.

491
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:14,105
I've had a lot of anxiety at work.
I don't feel appreciated.

492
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,022
Take a pizza
and call me in the morning.

493
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:20,183
You have the cure. Yes, you do.
The doctor's in the house.

494
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,984
Colonel, do us all a favour
and turn that frown upside down.

495
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,779
You're about to become
a very rich man.

496
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,828
And by the looks of your overhead,
you'll need it.

497
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,423
Let's get this over with!

498
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,026
What's the rush?
You act like this is your first time.

499
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,024
Relax. Enjoy.

500
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,347
Breathe in the mountain air.

501
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,705
Did you bring the money?

502
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,863
Of course I did. Didn't I just say
you're about to become very rich?

503
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,869
What do you think is in the bag?
Jellybeans?

504
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,504
Don't you trust me?

505
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,100
No.

506
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,221
I'm so excited!

507
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,382
This is like Christmas mornings
back at the orphanage.

508
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,143
I think I'm going to cry.

509
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,181
Colonel, you're the tops
of the pops.

510
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,223
Don't ever contact me again.

511
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,666
Don't turn your back on me.

512
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,379
Impressed?

513
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,589
Of course I'd never
do anything like this to you.

514
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,258
We're buddies.
Isn't that right, buddy?

515
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,464
-Yes.
-Good.

516
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,426
Now I want you to feel free to jump in
if I get any of this wrong.

517
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,980
You don't have the disk
and you don't have the girl.

518
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,021
Shame. I was so hoping
you'd jump in.

519
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,864
I did everything I could
to get you the disk.

520
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,426
Neither of us counted on
the lnterpol agent.

521
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,707
Let me take care of Simon.
You just tell me where Michael is.

522
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,986
Why do you keep
threatening me with Michael?

523
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,427
I'm only interested in Michael
because he'll lead me to the girl.

524
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:53,030
Hear me. And hear me well.

525
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,139
If you dare harm him--

526
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,144
He won't be harmed unless you
insist upon making me find him myself!

527
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:05,941
An accidental explosion at this
abandoned army complex killed 12 men.

528
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,308
Possibly connected to the incident
is a missing weapon...

529
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,429
...and the man who developed
that weapon, Colonel Jacques Telore.

530
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,588
-Find out what weapon is missing.
-Where are you going?

531
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,779
Date.

532
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,621
Give it a rest, Julius.
My neck's getting tired.

533
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,942
What the hell are you doing here?

534
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,469
I bought you flowers, baby.

535
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,140
You look great.

536
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,789
Really? Want to come in?

537
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,861
-Can l?
-No.

538
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,579
Oh, shit!

539
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,382
I thought we'd get some dinner.

540
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,388
Bullshit! It's 3 in the morning.
What do you want?

541
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,429
We can talk about your boss.

542
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,783
Ex-boss. He fired me
after you gave me that phony CD.

543
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,498
Puff Daddy? That was low.
Even for you.

544
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:02,899
I was just doing my job.

545
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,344
And I was just doing mine!

546
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,462
That was a $2000 gown!

547
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,785
You look better without it.

548
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,824
I'm done.

549
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,985
You wanna keep fighting?
Go ahead.

550
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,585
You really mean that?

551
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,619
Thanks!

552
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,903
I see.
You want to kill me?

553
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,903
First, tell me why
Gabrielli wants military software.

554
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,218
I really miss this.

555
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,823
I miss it too.

556
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,940
-Tell me about Gabrielli.
-Later.

557
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,344
Later?

558
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,545
Right now, I want to work out.

559
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,819
Lord, we beseech Thine forgiveness
for being wretched sinners.

560
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,539
We want to go
on the straight and narrow.

561
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,939
Straight and narrow.

562
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,466
Know that the proceeds from today will
go straight to the orphanage.

563
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,428
And which orphanage would that be?

564
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,902
The one on 6789 9 0 Avenue.

565
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,221
That's a very poor orphanage.

566
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,383
Very poor.

567
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,345
God bless us. I call.

568
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,469
I call too.

569
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,826
Straight! Ten high.
Where's your Messiah now, boys?

570
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:40,906
Judas, before you get too happy,
I think you better look at this. Bam!

571
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:45,948
Shouldn't you be
caring for the girl?

572
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,259
This is true.

573
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,659
Go, go, go!

574
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,588
Shame you're out of chips.

575
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,429
-She's still in the bathroom.
-Go check on her.

576
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,707
Enough fooling. Come out.
You been in there for two hours.

577
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,300
Nice enough fellow, but a real sucker.

578
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,943
Come on! Damn it, Claire!
Open the damn door!

579
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:10,625
Shit!

580
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:12,989
Oh, shit!

581
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,702
This whole thing's my father's fault.

582
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:37,860
What do you mean?

583
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:40,186
He doesn't want us to be together.

584
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,819
He told a lie
about your father kidnapping me--

585
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,059
My father?

586
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:55,945
Let's get out of here!

587
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,945
Stop! Let go of me!

588
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,059
Want some?

589
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,029
Tell me about Gabrielli.

590
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,988
I was wondering when
you'd get to that.

591
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,266
You must have
bigger fish to fry.

592
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:55,259
Whatever you think,
he's a guy with a good heart...

593
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,829
...who's trying
to protect his son.

594
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,220
Who's he trying to get
the software for? Ashton?

595
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,948
If you know the answers, why are you
asking me the questions?

596
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,748
Because I don't have the proof.

597
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:08,785
Sorry.

598
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,345
You want the good news
or the bad news?

599
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:13,545
The bad news.

600
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,099
The weapon?
We found out what it does.

601
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:19,860
-I'm listening.
-It's like a little portable laser.

602
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,828
It has a 300-mile range.

603
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,628
Fence's software targets it.

604
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,221
I was just getting to that.
How'd you know?

605
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:27,539
Forget it.
Give me the good news.

606
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,508
-The colonel called.
-So he lives.

607
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,548
And he speaks.
He called to say he's ready to talk.

608
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,940
-When?
-Now, at his office.

609
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,225
I'm on my way.

610
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,347
-I have to go.
-Save it.

611
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:42,585
What was that for?

612
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,390
For coming over here
thinking you'd get what you got!

613
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,425
Is Simon here?

614
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,186
-Can I come in?
-I don't know. Can you?

615
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:19,102
-May I come in?
-All you had to do is ask.

616
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,545
-What happened?
-Don't ask.

617
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:31,745
-Ask what?
-What happened.

618
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,265
-To us? Nothing. Why do you ask?
-I'm not.

619
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,386
-Not what?
-Asking.

620
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,222
-You told us not to.
-Not to what?

621
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,142
-Not to ask.
-Not to ask what?

622
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:41,221
-What happened?
-To you?

623
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,222
-No, to you.
-What about me?

624
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,779
-What happened?
-I lost the girl.

625
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:46,826
You what?

626
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,146
How does one go about losing
an entire girl?

627
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,789
Don't ask.

628
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:53,229
You hear that?

629
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:54,739
What?

630
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:56,865
That!

631
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,508
Move, move, move! It's gonna be
a tight squeeze!

632
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,623
Hold on! Wait for me!

633
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,219
I'm not a good runner!

634
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,342
I told you to learn
to run in these shoes!

635
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:21,785
Come on! Come on!

636
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,188
I have to exercise more!

637
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:33,499
Come on, keep up!

638
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,901
If I knew I'd get my ass shot,
I'd have started training!

639
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,262
I don't want to run anymore!

640
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,343
Thank you for coming.

641
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,828
For God's sake, old boy,
drop your weapon.

642
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,344
Guns make me nervous.

643
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:22,743
Come on....

644
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:36,947
Good. Now kick it away like
the little footballer that you are.

645
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:40,584
Goal!

646
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:43,140
Where's the disk?

647
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:44,585
I don't have it.

648
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:47,583
My boys checked your office.
It isn't there either.

649
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:48,785
Don't worry.

650
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:52,818
I'll keep your friends alive
until I get what I want!

651
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:57,621
As for the colonel, he dies if you
don't give me the disk.

652
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,544
I said I don't have it.

653
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:03,465
What a pity.

654
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,986
Keep running! Just up this way!

655
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,504
This way! Come on!

656
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:10,499
Get in here!

657
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:12,503
Why are we going in here?

658
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,343
What's so funny?

659
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,028
Well, it's really not that funny.

660
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:31,989
But that tunnel's
filled with quicksand.

661
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,345
Really?

662
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,900
That one leads to the beach.

663
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,306
What are we waiting for?
Let's hit the beach.

664
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:41,502
You go. We'll see
what happened to the Cyberlair.

665
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,103
Don't worry about us.

666
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,227
-I can't.
-Why not?

667
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:47,267
-Because I'm sinking!
-What?

668
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:56,219
I knew it was a damn right!
You tell me go left!

669
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:57,789
I was wrong! I'm sorry!

670
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,304
You always damn wrong!

671
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:01,381
You'll never forgive me!

672
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:02,540
You damn right!

673
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,025
Stop moving around!
You're making it worse!

674
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:10,500
This way, my man!

675
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,220
Where are you?

676
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:14,062
In the quicksand!

677
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:17,385
Look for three floating heads
in the smoke!

678
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,020
Big man sinking fast!

679
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,146
There's things in here, man!

680
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,585
Didn't we talk about this
the last time?

681
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,387
Put up a sign and you'll know
where the quicksand is.

682
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,029
Then it wouldn't be a trap.

683
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,625
They don't teach this
in spy school.

684
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:37,823
-Stop talking.
-Why?

685
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,264
You'll sink faster.

686
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:42,986
Why didn't you tell me that before?
Talking sinks faster!

687
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:45,141
What are you doing here?
Where's Claire?

688
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:46,948
He wants Claire, okay?

689
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:48,942
-What time is it?
-It's morning time.

690
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,306
Shit! I gotta call my boss!

691
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:53,699
Big guy next!

692
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,145
-You ain't gonna save a brother?
-Big guy next!

693
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:57,982
Call Greenpeace!

694
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:01,103
I see. You'll save
the white man, but not me?

695
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:04,623
Where is Claire?

696
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,705
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

697
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:09,508
You're lying!
I saw them take her!

698
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,061
I'm sorry.
Things got out of hand.

699
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:14,426
Tell me where she is!

700
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,784
Damn!

701
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:42,669
Looks like Ashton's been busy.

702
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:50,941
We'll try and find a first-aid kit.
Get you fixed up.

703
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,144
Forget it.

704
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:59,306
Only one thing will fix me up.

705
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:05,343
Look, they didn't get the disk!

706
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:08,266
Cheer up.
It's not that bad.

707
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:10,948
I'll do my Buddha for you.

708
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:24,023
Claire's been kidnapped again!

709
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,988
-By who?
-Some guy named Ashton.

710
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,141
Why doesn't that surprise me?

711
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:32,823
Fence fired me. He's giving Ashton
the software himself.

712
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:35,504
If he gets the software,
Ashton'll kill them both.

713
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,662
Yeah, I know, Simon.
It's over. It's all over.

714
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,980
It ain't over.

715
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:59,021
I don't know what your feelings are
about your father, but I love him.

716
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:02,382
He's about to make me
a very rich and powerful man.

717
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,589
Does he give you lots of presents?

718
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:09,745
Darling.
Oh, you've been crying.

719
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:12,744
There you go.

720
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:17,106
Now you're all pretty again.
How do I look?

721
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,668
Wish me luck.
I have a date with your father!

722
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,946
I wanna help,
but I'd be in your way!

723
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:29,505
Don't worry about it.
Just go home.

724
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,302
Chill out. I got work to do.

725
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,381
Because of me.
You wanna know why?

726
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:34,818
Hold this.

727
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:39,579
You got work to do
because this is all my fault.

728
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,503
I said I was in the CIA.
I was never in the CIA.

729
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,059
I got kicked out of
that class at Langley.

730
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:48,188
That's why you barely remembered me.
I'm a liar!

731
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:50,700
Me getting out of here is
Claire's only chance.

732
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:52,782
You have personal issues, don't you?

733
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,021
Tell me.
Don't you think I want to help?

734
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,386
Don't you think I know how much
you need my help?

735
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:59,507
I'm just no good!

736
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:04,625
Don't just stand there.
Get the door!

737
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:09,703
All right, nobody move!

738
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,745
I'm Michael Gabrielli.

739
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,626
I'm Simon. This is Nick.

740
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:17,663
I know who you are.

741
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:21,869
If you really work for Claire's father
you'll help me get her back.

742
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:23,020
Don't move!

743
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:29,223
What are you doing, man?

744
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:31,779
You can't trust this guy!
He's trouble!

745
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,418
You're signing your death warrant.
He's bad news!

746
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:39,946
It's written all over his face.
It's in French, but I can read it.

747
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,704
Let's go.

748
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:44,665
I cannot believe you are
dragging me into this.

749
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:46,787
I thought you had
somewhere to go, like home.

750
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:50,386
And leave you alone with
this psychopath? I don't think so.

751
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:56,103
I got my eye on you,
so no funny stuff.

752
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,264
You're late!

753
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,021
Mr. Fence, I presume?

754
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:30,383
Claire has told me so much about you.

755
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:32,507
Do you have the disk?

756
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:36,830
Yes. Where's my daughter?

757
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:39,786
She's shopping at Gucci's.

758
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:41,019
Oh, no.

759
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:43,904
That's right.
She's tied up in my library.

760
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,061
Now give me the disk!

761
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:51,260
All right.
Now take me to her.

762
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:53,341
Sorry. No can do.

763
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:57,862
You just wait here while I go
and check this little puppy out.

764
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:03,700
If there's anything wrong with this,
I'll be back...

765
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:05,628
...with her hands.

766
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,110
How much to save them from the
slaughterhouse, my son?

767
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,669
Forty pieces of gold!

768
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,580
-I'll give you 30.
-Forty pieces of gold!

769
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:31,027
-Thirty pieces--!
-Forty pieces of gold!

770
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:34,269
It's an awfully high price
to pay for salvation!

771
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,023
Give me the staff and I'll--

772
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,949
I got the sheep!
I need a staff for the sheep!

773
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:41,909
For 40 pieces of gold,
it should come with a stick!

774
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:43,583
Give me this!

775
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:48,427
Hello, my flock!
Have I got a mission for you!

776
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:51,548
Come on.
We're going to get Ashton.

777
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:53,708
Where are you going?
Stop!

778
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,822
Do I look like I can run a marathon?!
Get over here!

779
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:59,543
Hold on! Hold on!
Wait for me!

780
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,906
Wait for me! Wait!
Over here!

781
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:05,267
Talk to me, guys!
What is this Silence of the Lambs?

782
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:08,180
I got you. I got you.

783
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:10,983
When I kiss your lips

784
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:14,859
It's like I just touched fire

785
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:19,906
Oh, naughty boy
Can you be true?

786
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:23,665
Come on, fellas!

787
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:27,027
Remember, the Lord is my shepherd.
And I'm yours!

788
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:29,904
Stick together! Closely now.

789
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:34,221
You, back there! Hurry up!
Get up near me!

790
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:36,787
I want you to be brave sheep.

791
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:40,420
Every sheep dies,
but not every sheep really lives!

792
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,069
Follow me!

793
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:43,743
Don't be afraid.

794
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,909
Come on.

795
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:48,260
That's it!

796
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:50,222
I look into your eyes

797
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:53,621
Fills me with this mad desire

798
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,146
I'm not going to let them hurt you!

799
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,506
Just block the way and
I'll do the rest!

800
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:02,264
What the devil
are they doing, Xin Xin?

801
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:06,907
Remove them! It's a bridge,
not a petting zoo!

802
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,265
Over here, fellas!

803
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:10,222
Not too close,
I'm allergic to wool.

804
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:14,110
Stay with me!
I won't let the bad men hurt you!

805
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,499
Make me proud.

806
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,184
-Got a problem, brother?
-The sheep. Move them!

807
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,499
The sheep are meek!

808
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:25,060
Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth!

809
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:30,505
I'd be lying if I said
this didn't look like trouble.

810
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,183
Tell them to move that truck!

811
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,019
Get back!

812
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:41,826
Get back!

813
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:48,101
Oh, my God!

814
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:49,979
Out of the car!

815
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,344
Have you seen my staff?

816
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,309
There you go!

817
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:04,908
And now for you!

818
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,383
I'll say a Hail Mary for him.

819
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:34,507
This is for you!

820
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:44,863
Oh, God!

821
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,228
Get us the dickens out of here!

822
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:08,109
I fear no evil,
for He is at my side.

823
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:10,580
Come back here and fight,
you cowards!

824
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:23,903
You were supposed to drop off the sheep
and go back to the lab!

825
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:26,545
I know, but I was only
trying to help...

826
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,588
...and you always say I should
get more exercise.

827
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:31,349
Get back to the lab!

828
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,262
Nick, can you hear me?

829
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:53,580
Hey, buddy, what's up?

830
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:55,627
Are you inside the castle yet?

831
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,828
I'm on my way. I'm almost there.

832
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:59,304
What are you doing here?

833
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,263
What's it look like I'm doing?
I'm having a conversation!

834
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:05,104
What happened, clown-face?
A bird shit on your eye?

835
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:22,744
There you are.

836
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:26,346
If you're not too busy, I'm having
a spot of trouble on my way in.

837
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,182
Be a dear and send help.

838
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:39,948
Look! We did it! We won!

839
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:42,226
These guys are running away!

840
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:47,342
You see it?!
They're running away!

841
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:50,468
Nobody's got the balls
to fight with Nick Miranda!

842
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:24,661
-Need some help?
-I can always use help.

843
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:27,101
Go get Ashton!
I'll help out with Claire!

844
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:49,107
Congratulations, boss!

845
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:52,547
You finally got the software.

846
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,062
I know where Claire is.

847
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:34,629
I got a secret!

848
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:38,183
Nice talking to you.

849
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:09,142
-Are you all right?
-Now I am!

850
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:10,546
Hold it!

851
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,502
It's cool, Nick.
I'm on your side.

852
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,308
Let's get out of here.

853
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:30,902
Tracking coordinates.
Subsystems activated.

854
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:38,144
Ready to accept targeting input.

855
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:45,344
How fabulous of you
to pay us a visit.

856
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:56,181
You're just in time to see my new toy!

857
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:59,786
I call it
"Ashton's Super Weapon of Death."

858
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,627
-Catchy, don't you think?
-Not really.

859
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:06,743
What do you know?
You're just an lnterpol agent.

860
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:09,582
Guess what we're
blowing up first?

861
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:11,625
Your ego?

862
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,069
No, but nice try, sailor.

863
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:16,539
The Eiffel Tower!

864
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:20,339
Why?

865
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:24,783
Because it's big and it's delicious
and I'm tired of looking at it.

866
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:27,459
When I dazzle them
with my toy's abilities...

867
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:30,947
...people will pay me lots of money
to destroy things for them!

868
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:34,666
I've never been an employee before.
I think I might like it.

869
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:48,148
Last call for all tourists to look
at the Eiffel Tower.

870
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:59,469
Can you hear me? It's the bee!

871
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,706
Yes! Ashton!
At the keyboard!

872
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:03,463
I got it. I got it.

873
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:06,548
Go on, stupid insect!

874
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:07,865
Target is acquired.

875
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,029
Teatime!

876
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:18,699
Stupid bee!

877
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:22,266
You're just a fly
with a stinger on your ass!

878
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:43,821
I'd invite you on holiday with me...

879
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:46,538
...but with all my luggage,
there isn't room!

880
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:47,825
Where will he sit?

881
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:49,264
He was going to drive!

882
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:53,219
Right now I'll concentrate
on killing you!

883
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:59,265
Target is now locked.
Stand by to fire!

884
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:12,868
So long, Simon!

885
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:37,305
Power module overload.

886
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:39,907
This is not a good thing.

887
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:41,947
You've got to be kidding!

888
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:44,825
All personnel...

889
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:48,022
...please evacuate the facilities.

890
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:04,342
What the hell was that?

891
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:09,023
That's our Simon!

892
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:35,780
May your first child be
a masculine child.

893
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:37,543
Unless it's a girl.

894
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:40,702
In which case, may she be
a feminine child.

895
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:42,623
Amen, Brother.

896
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:44,699
Goodbye.

897
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:54,187
Don't drive too fast!

898
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:13,909
It's done!

899
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:17,984
They never saw me coming.
I was amazing. Bad guys went down!

900
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:19,862
-Good.
-So, what now?

901
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,788
Do you want to debrief me
or something?

902
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:24,978
I got a date, bro.

903
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:26,299
Bye-bye, Nick.

904
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:29,704
Where are you going?

905
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:32,942
This is my first solo mission!
Don't you want to hear the details?

906
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:34,464
Come on!

907
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:37,583
Nice talking to you.

908
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:43,303
What's wrong, Nicholas?

909
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:46,667
Simon. It's my first mission
and he doesn't even care.

910
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,986
He's preoccupied.
It's a wedding!

911
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,141
Love is in the air!

912
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:53,263
Don't feel bad.

913
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:56,382
Micro's first mission
got him the nickname Free Willy.

914
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:57,665
Really?

915
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:58,865
How was that?

916
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:01,300
Simon had me working undercover
at a strip joint.

917
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:03,063
As in, you were a stripper?

918
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:07,144
I prefer the term "exotic dancer."
Free Willy was my stage name.

919
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:09,950
Sometimes "White Chocolate,"
if I was feeling sassy.

920
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,260
In a G-string!
Where can you hide a wire?

921
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:16,298
I got places to hide a wire.
If they find it, they can have it.

922
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:21,146
Gentlemen, coming to the stage...
Free Willy!

923
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:04,139
