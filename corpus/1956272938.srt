- "Will you die for me?"

687
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:25,504
- What was that?
- [Clears throat]

688
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:26,838
"Will you die for me?"

689
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:30,942
One more time.

690
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,311
"Will you die for me?"

691
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:40,819
I will.
I will die for you, Tex.

692
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:43,689
And I will die
for you, Charlie.

693
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:45,891
I know you will,

694
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,860
'cause we're brothers

695
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:51,730
and we're all family.

696
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,800
We're out doin'
the right things.

697
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,502
Spreadin' love.

698
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:58,870
Lovin' on each other.

699
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:06,578
[Laughter]

700
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:50,756
Do you love me?

701
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,625
Of course I do...

702
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:56,562
Since the first
night I met you.

703
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,501
Why?

704
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:05,871
Your words.

705
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:09,040
They way
you looked at me.

706
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:13,645
The way you
spoke to me.

707
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,847
The way you told me
I was beautiful.

708
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:29,461
My stepsister
said I had to meet you.

709
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:31,863
She was right.

710
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,837
You've shown
me the way, Charlie.

711
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:43,842
No one ever told me
I was beautiful before.

712
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,545
No one ever
loved me like you.

713
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,650
[Laughs]

714
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,497
[Whickers]

715
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,672
You got
a call inside.

716
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,741
A call?
Like a night call

717
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:17,743
- or an animal call?
- No, it's some fella

718
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,578
named mur... melcher?

719
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:20,979
Oh, ter...
Oh, Terry's calling.

720
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,881
Oh, he must be
runnin' late

721
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:25,283
slammin' me with
that huge ol' record
contract, right?

722
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,785
Right?
[Laughs] Let me tell ya,

723
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,053
this guy loves me.

724
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:30,488
This guy loves me.
This is gonna be good.

725
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,063
Hey! Hey,
ter, man!

726
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:44,736
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Wha...

727
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,004
Well, yeah.
Well, no.

728
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:47,773
Terry, I figured
we'd add the full band

729
00:41:47,806 --> 00:41:49,975
in the full sessions.

730
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:57,716
Well, why the fuck
did you guys
bring me out then?

731
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:59,918
No, that's not
what they told me.

732
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,721
So, you're just gonna
sit there and lie?

733
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,322
That's how this works?

734
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,758
No, man!
I'm not out of control!

735
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:09,928
I'm in control, man!
No! You're the one
that's full of shit!

736
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,816
2,000 years ago,
god was born into a man,

737
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:33,852
and that man
created miracles.

738
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,787
The enlightened ones
saw this

739
00:42:35,821 --> 00:42:39,090
and they followed him
while others persecuted him.

740
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:41,059
Now, the Bible says

741
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:44,062
that Jesus died
for our sins.

742
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,698
Well, in reality,
Jesus died

743
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:49,668
because of humans'
propensity to hate.

744
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,803
Hate against those
who inspire,

745
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:54,372
against those who live
against the grain.

746
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,608
If bloodshed
shall occur

747
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:58,043
it's par
for the course.

748
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,605
What shall we do then
with Jesus who is called Christ?

749
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:04,743
And at the last supper,
Jesus took bread

750
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:07,045
he broke it
and he gave thanks.

751
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:09,114
He gave it to
his disciples,
and he said

752
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:12,217
"this is my body,
given for you.

753
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,753
Do this
in remembrance of me."

754
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:18,123
Again, after supper,
he took the cup,

755
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,959
he poured it.
He gave thanks.

756
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,293
He gave it to
his disciples
and he said,

757
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,830
"this is my blood
of the covenant,"

758
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:27,733
shed for you
and for many.

759
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:29,768
"Do this
in remembrance of me."

760
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:33,905
"I speak the truth
when I tell you"

761
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:36,074
that I will not
drink from the fruit
of the vine

762
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:38,910
again until I am seated

763
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:43,915
"next to my father
in the kingdom of heaven."

764
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:46,718
And then Jesus
and his disciples

765
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:48,887
they sang
beautiful hymns

766
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,057
as they walked to the top
of the mount of olives.

767
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,259
And his disciples
were with him,

768
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:56,194
because those
who forsake him

769
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:58,830
were at the foot
of the mountain.

770
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:29,260
I thought it was
gonna kick-start

771
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:31,997
when they shot Dr. King...
But it didn't.

772
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,332
It's because blacks
can't do anything

773
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:36,201
without the whites
showin' 'em how it's done.

774
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,537
Whitey,
he's out fightin'

775
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,106
pickin' fights
across the world.

776
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:45,110
The blacks are here
killin' their heroes.

777
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:47,112
Look at Malcolm X.

778
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:51,382
Shot down by the very people
he was speakin' up for.

779
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,119
That's not how
you win wars.

780
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:56,888
You don't go
killin' your heroes.

781
00:45:56,922 --> 00:45:58,957
You don't go turnin'
them into martyrs.

782
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,325
That just makes
you as a people,

783
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:03,161
as a culture,
come to a boil

784
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:06,264
until, finally,
you reach a point,
the top blows off,

785
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:07,899
and you explode.

786
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:09,835
This world's
comin' to an end.

787
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,870
The war is close.

788
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:16,842
God and the devil,
finally, are gonna set
their differences aside

789
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,911
shake hands
and watch

790
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:23,314
while we destroy
ourselves.

791
00:46:23,348 --> 00:46:26,151
"Helter skelter,"
that's what it's called.

792
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:29,320
"Helter skelter"
and it's close.

793
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:31,189
And we're gonna be prepared
for it.

794
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:32,290
We're gonna be
off in the desert

795
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:35,894
far away from the bloodshed
when it comes this way.

796
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:39,230
We'll be playing guitar
and lovin' one another

797
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:40,598
while the rest
of the world

798
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,167
is killin' itself.

799
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,136
I can't wait
for them to suffer.

800
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:49,074
Blacks and the Jews
just take, you know?

801
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:51,276
They expect
everyone to care

802
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,144
and everyone pretends
like this facade...

803
00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:55,446
This charade
like they do care

804
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,018
but they don't.
They bring it on
themselves.

805
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:01,352
That's right.
They sure do.
It's all greed.

806
00:47:01,386 --> 00:47:03,054
That's why we live
with nature.

807
00:47:03,088 --> 00:47:05,323
We don't need
your power plants.

808
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:07,025
We don't need
your color televisions

809
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,895
your iconography
or your self-worship.

810
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:12,931
No, we live free.
Movie stars...

811
00:47:12,964 --> 00:47:15,633
-movie stars aren't
better than me.
- No, Charlie.

812
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,102
- Oh, no.
- Terry melcher?

813
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:19,004
Terry melcher
ain't better than me.

814
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:21,940
- Fuck no! Fuck that pig!
- The Beatles?

815
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:24,275
The Beatles
ain't better than me.

816
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:26,912
Just because you're
on the cover of a magazine

817
00:47:26,945 --> 00:47:28,446
that don't make
you Jesus Christ.

818
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:32,350
Mankind has reveled
in self-splendor

819
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:34,385
for too long.

820
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:38,089
The oceans are gonna
run red with blood,

821
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:42,360
and the streets
are gonna burn
with fire.

822
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:45,230
Helter skelter is coming.

823
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,470
Helter skelter.

824
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,009
I don't see a race war
out in the streets.

825
00:47:58,043 --> 00:48:00,011
Y-you don't?

826
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:01,679
Don't you turn
on your television?

827
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,414
That's what
you fat cats do, right?

828
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:05,683
Drink beer
all day, watch TV.

829
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,485
Let the TV make up
your mind for you.

830
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:12,357
Some do.
Yeah, some people do.

831
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,259
Not you, though.

832
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:18,029
- Not me.
- You're more
of a thinkin' man.

833
00:48:20,165 --> 00:48:23,201
I like to "think"
that I am.

834
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:28,273
You got a way
with words too.

835
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:30,375
You're funny...
I like that...

836
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:33,244
And clever.

837
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:35,280
What am I?

838
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:41,519
How did you first meet
Sharon Tate?

839
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:45,456
You didn't
answer my question.

840
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:49,260
What am I?

841
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:51,362
How did you first
meet Sharon Tate?

842
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:54,165
Oh, I see what
you're doin' here.

843
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:56,067
Fine, I'll play
in your little game.

844
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:58,336
[Scoffs]
Truth of the matter is,

845
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:00,138
I just went up
and knocked on her door.

846
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:03,241
- Did she answer?
- No, she didn't answer.

847
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,310
Someone else did.

848
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:09,114
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe she was suspicious
or something.

849
00:49:09,147 --> 00:49:10,548
Why would you
think that?

850
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:12,550
It's crazy out
that way, man.

851
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:16,521
You know?
This world's changin'.
That's for sure.

852
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:18,756
I see.

853
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,027
I didn't know
it was gonna be her
that answered the door.

854
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,196
I was lookin' for
that son-of-a-bitch
Terry melcher.

855
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,298
I think he know
I was comin' because

856
00:49:27,332 --> 00:49:30,301
he didn't
live there no more.

857
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:36,307

[Knocking]

859
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:21,119
- Hello.
- Uh, yeah. Hi.

860
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,488
Um, I'm lookin'
for Terry.

861
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,657
- Is he around right now?
- Uh, no. I don't know
a Terry.

862
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:29,327
I met with him here
just a few months back.

863
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,129
Terry melcher,
he's good buddies

864
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:33,164
with Dennis Wilson
from the beach boys.

865
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:34,299
I'm sorry.
You're mistaken.

866
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:36,134
This is the polanski
residence.

867
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:39,337
Oh, polanski.
You mean, like,
the movie people?

868
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,639
- Like "Rosemary's baby"?
- Yes.

869
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:44,442
Okay. Okay,
well, I see.

870
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:46,844
- Who is it, shar?
- It's just a man.

871
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,147
Hi, yeah.
It's Charlie.
My name's Charlie.

872
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,149
- Good afternoon, Charlie.
- Good afternoon.

873
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:53,318
Maybe try going
through the back alley.

874
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:56,487
- Back alley?
- Yes, the guest house.
Maybe Terry is there.

875
00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:58,623
I know.
Check the back alley,

876
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:00,591
I guess.

877
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:07,098
You didn't have
to be so rude to the guy.

878
00:51:07,132 --> 00:51:09,200
You really should
be careful up here.

879
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:11,469
Alone half the time
with your husband halfway
across the country.

880
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:14,139
- It's crazy!
- I'm fine.

881
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:15,873
Don't worry so much.

882
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:20,145
Besides,
I have all these friends
looking out for me.

883

[Muttering]

884
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:29,887
- Hey, Charlie. Almost
got dinner ready.
- Tex.

885
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,589
Great. Tex.

886
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:35,293
You're the right person.

887
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:37,362
You're the one
that can do this, Tex.

888
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:40,431
Do what, man?
What do you need?

889
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:43,301
I feel it comin'.
It's almost here...

890
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:45,203
-helter skelter.
It's on it's way.
- Now?

891
00:51:45,236 --> 00:51:47,238
- Yeah, now.
- Shit. We gotta
get outta here.

892
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:49,240
We gotta
round up the girls
and get outta here.

893
00:51:49,274 --> 00:51:52,443
No, we need some cash.
We need to get some
quick cash first.

894
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:54,645
We need some quick cash
for the road.

895
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,285
All right. Uh...

896
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:02,487
You know that lady
I got in the city?

897
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,589
- Louella.
- Yeah, louella.

898
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,491
- The drug dealer.
- Yeah.

899
00:52:06,524 --> 00:52:10,361
Well, maybe she
can put me in touch
with one of her guys.

900
00:52:10,395 --> 00:52:11,596
And I'll make
some kind of deal.

901
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,231
Steal their money
or somethin'.

902
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:14,932
- I don't know, man.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Make a hustle.

903
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,402
- We got time.
- We got... yeah,
we got time,

904
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:19,437
- but it's comin' quick.
- Okay.

905
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,506
- All right.
- All right, Charlie.
I won't let you down.

906
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:22,673
- All right.
- I won't let you down.

[Tex]
Good evening, gentlemen,
I got a buyer.

909
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:30,781
I got one primed
and waiting over
in Santa Monica.

910
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:34,252
Now, you give me the shit
and I'll take it over to him.

911
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:36,187
I'll be back
in a couple hours
with the cash...

912
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:39,224
-minus my cut.
- If you don't come back
with our money...

913
00:52:39,257 --> 00:52:40,425
I'm gonna
fuck you up.

914
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:41,759
You guys
will be happy.

915
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,394
That's why
we're here, right?

[Ringing continues]

919
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:07,585
- Good evenin'.
- Yeah, I'm lookin'
for Charles.

920
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:09,620
- Charles who?
- The Charles that just
ripped me off.

921
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:11,422
- That Charles.
- Look, man. This is Charles.

922
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:12,790
I don't know
what you're talking about.

923
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:14,325
The tall ass
white boy from Texas.

924
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:15,693
That Charles.

925
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:17,428
Look, don't think
I won't find him, man.

926
00:53:17,462 --> 00:53:19,397
Don't think
I won't find you.

927
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,366
You help him out,
that's as bad as
stealin' from me.

928
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:23,301
You understand?

929
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:25,570
You ever heard
of the black panthers?

930
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:28,339
You ever heard of 'em?
If you don't bring that
son-of-a-bitch up here,

931
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:29,507
I'm gonna come
to your house

932
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,610
and bring every
black panther
in I.A. county with me

933
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:35,346
and gut your entire
fucking family.

934
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:42,687
- [Banging]
- Oh! I'm all eyes, man.

935
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,255
I'm all-seeing.
I'm all-knowing.

936
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:45,823
Look, man.
Just listen, okay?

937
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,592
There's just a big
misunderstanding.

938
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,460
We're gonna
talk about this.

939
00:53:49,494 --> 00:53:51,629
Tex here tells me
he couldn't find
his tourist buddy

940
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:53,431
and couldn't
make the drop.

941
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:55,266
- I couldn't
find him anywhere.
- See?

942
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,668
Tried to find
another buyer
but it was too late.

943
00:53:57,702 --> 00:53:59,604
- You know tourists, man.
- If he couldn't find him

944
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:01,472
then he should've
brought the shit right back.

945
00:54:01,506 --> 00:54:02,540
Don't listen
to what he's sayin'.

946
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,809
He's scammin' me.
Man, he's scammin' both of us.

947
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:08,313
- Don't believe this shit!
- Why wouldn't I believe him?
This is my friend.

948
00:54:08,346 --> 00:54:10,781
I brought him
in my home.

949
00:54:10,815 --> 00:54:13,751
So you're
just like him then?

950
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:16,821
Another scheming,
dirty-assed
fuckin' hippie.

951
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:18,623
You're all the same.
Don't practice
what you preach.

952
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:25,763
You know what?

953
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:28,299
- Fuck you!

955
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:33,371
Uh-uh! Don't do that!
Don't do that, man!

956
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:35,306
I shot your friend.
Don't think I won't
shoot you.

957
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,074
He's bleedin', motherfucker!
He's gonna die!

958
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,676
You don't know that.
You're not Jesus!

959
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:41,412
You're not Jesus.
We're the chosen ones!

960
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:42,780
That's right!
You do think you're Jesus?

961
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:44,382
Then heal him!

962
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:46,384
- Fuck you!
- Can't touch us, blackie!

963
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:49,487
- Fuck you!
- You tell your
black panther friends

964
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,921

One small step
for man.

966
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:57,428
One giant leap
for mankind.

- Are you getting a TV
picture now, Houston?
-[Beep]

968
00:55:00,565 --> 00:55:02,700
- Wow.
- It's fake.

969
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:05,803
- I know it's fake.
- How do you know?

970
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:08,406
It is.
I wrote the script.

971
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:11,376
Oh, yeah? How come
Roman didn't direct it then?

972
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,511
- I mean, I could've
said those lines.
-[Laughing]

973
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,480
It's top secret.
You'd tell everyone.

974
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:17,415
Like you're
telling us now?

975
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:19,684
- Oh, now I have
to kill you.
-[Mock gasping]

976
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:21,452

00:55:44,475 --> 00:55:46,844
What the fuck?

980
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:48,379
So, that mescaline
you got me,

981
00:55:48,413 --> 00:55:49,647
didn't work out
so well, man.

982
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,449
What are you talking
about, man? Get off me.

983
00:55:51,482 --> 00:55:53,484
Shit had me seeing
way too much like reality.

984
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:55,786
Reality's no good
when you're lookin'
for an escape.

985
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,488
Man, if you'd stop
using that shit

986
00:55:57,522 --> 00:55:59,857
like a goddamn junkie...
Use that shit right.

987
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:04,495
- That was prime shit.
- Word is you got 21k
floatin' around in here.

988
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:05,996
What are you talking about?
I got nothin'.

989
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,666
I wonder where a guy
like you would keep 20 grand?

990
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,535
- In the mattress?
- What are you talking about?

991
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:11,869
In the ice box?

992
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:13,871
It doesn't seem
wise to me that a guy like you

993
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:17,608
would keep $21,000
sitting on the counter
for everyone to see.

994
00:56:17,642 --> 00:56:20,611
You come with us,
you'll have plenty
places to keep your cash

- get off!
- And your stash.

998
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:29,887
They told me
to call you "Linda."
I like that name.

999
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,890
I never really
thought about it
much myself.

1000
00:56:32,923 --> 00:56:36,461
Well, it means "soft."

1001
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,195
It means "tender."

1002
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,599
- I didn't know that.
- You think it's true?

1003

I don't know.

1004

that this world needs
more of, it's tenderness.

What do you read?

1021
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:42,960
I don't know.

1022
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:45,630
History.

1023
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:47,732
Philosophy.

1024
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:50,835
Philosophy
as in thought?

1025
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:55,740
Philosophy
as in religion?

1026
00:57:55,773 --> 00:57:59,009
Both, I guess.

1027
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:01,646
Are you nervous?

1028
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:03,981
- No.
- [Laughs softly]

1029
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:06,483
You scared of me?

1030
00:58:07,685 --> 00:58:09,687
No.

1031
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:17,027
See, I know how
it is out in the world
there, you know.

1032
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:19,564
People judge

1033
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:24,735
as soon as you even
get a word out of your mouth.

1034
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:26,837
It's not like that here.

1035
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:28,773
It's not like
that at all.

1036
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,609
It's beautiful here.

1037
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:36,581
You're beautiful here.

1038
00:58:54,765 --> 00:59:01,572
♪ All to Jesus,
I surrender ♪

1039
00:59:01,606 --> 00:59:08,045
♪ All to him
I freely give ♪

1040
00:59:08,078 --> 00:59:15,019
♪ I will ever
love and trust him ♪

1041
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:20,858
♪ In his presence

1042
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:07,037
What are you
tryin' to do to me?

1043
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:09,974
W-w-what?

1044
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:13,844
- [Breathing heavily]
- [Laughing]

1045
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:18,716
I don't have anything
to give you.

1046
01:00:18,749 --> 01:00:21,118
You give
bad drugs to people,

1047
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:24,855
so why would
I believe anything
that you have to say?

1048
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,896
Let me tell you
about truth.

1049
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,004
When my mother died,

1050
01:00:40,037 --> 01:00:42,840
my father said

1051
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:45,843
he would take care
of my brothers and I

1052
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:49,847
that he'd do
anything for us.

1053
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,818
- But did he?
- [Gasps]

1054
01:00:56,987 --> 01:01:02,192
No, he didn't.

1055
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:03,894
Instead, he drank
himself to death

1056
01:01:03,928 --> 01:01:06,731
and then he left us.

1057
01:01:11,936 --> 01:01:15,706
I stopped
going to church.

1058
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:19,143
And I took care of us...

1059
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,245
Provided.

1060
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:28,953
I did anything
it took.

1061
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:33,290
So...

1062
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:36,093
When you say...

1063
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:39,096
That you...

1064
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:42,232
Are flat broke...

1065
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:45,970
Simply because you don't
want to be held accountable

1066
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:49,306
for what
you did to us...

1067
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:55,012
Well, you think
we're gonna believe that?

1068
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:58,315
Well, now,

1069
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:02,186
you got more problems
than anyone in this room.

1070
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:09,726
[Groans, gasping]

1071
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:31,916
Gary looks like you could
use a maid around here.

1072
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:34,118
- This boy's a mess.
- He won't give it up!

1073
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:39,790
I know he has it!
That lyin' piece of shit!

1074
01:02:39,824 --> 01:02:43,027
- Is that true?
- Hell no, it's not true.

1075
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,761
What about
the money?

1076
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:47,865
All your cash.

1077
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:50,100
[Scoffs]
What cash?

1078
01:02:53,237 --> 01:02:56,807
Your inheritance.

1079
01:02:56,841 --> 01:02:59,276
I said
where's the goddamn money?

1080
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:02,146
Like I been tellin'
them for three days,

1081
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:04,148
I don't have anything!

1082
01:03:04,181 --> 01:03:07,284
I don't have any cash!
What do you want me
to tell you?

1083
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:10,220
What do you
want me to say?

1084
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:13,157
What do I want you to say?
What do I want you to say?

1085
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:17,061
I'll tell you
what I fucking want
you to say, Gary.

1086
01:03:23,868 --> 01:03:26,871
I want you...
To stop lying...

1087
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:27,872
Through your teeth.

1088
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,076
[Screams]

1089
01:03:33,878 --> 01:03:38,815
[Laughing]

1090
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:47,324
Take whatever you want.

1091
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:49,093
Make it look like
blackie did it.

1092
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:54,231
- Oh, poor ba... horrible.
- [Moaning]

1093
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:57,367
[Laughing]

1094
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:59,303
- [Groans]
- [Laughs]

1095
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:03,407
Hold him down!
Hold him down!

1096
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,342
- Push it down on his face!
- I'm trying!

1097
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,144
- He's too strong!
- Push him down
like this!

1098
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:09,013
- Hold him down like this.
- Okay.

1099
01:04:09,046 --> 01:04:10,214
You can hold
him down, yeah!

1100
01:04:10,247 --> 01:04:12,249
Yeah! Hold him down. Yeah.

1101
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:15,152
- [Laughing]
- [Groaning]

1102
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:20,190
- [Screaming]
- [Grunting]

1103
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:23,127
- [Cutting flesh]
- [Muffled screams]

1104
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:28,065
- Still moving.
- [Sobbing]

1105
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:34,204
You know they picked up
Bobby beausoleil

1106
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:36,206
a couple of weeks later
off the 101

1107
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:40,244
driving Gary hinman's
fiat, right?

1108
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:43,080
Well, uh, what
do you mean,
"picked him up"?

1109
01:04:43,113 --> 01:04:45,182
Arrested him.

1110
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:47,051
Oh.

1111
01:04:47,084 --> 01:04:50,187
Well, that's a shame.
Good kid.

1112
01:04:52,256 --> 01:04:55,025
At the scene,
there were what
appeared to be

1113
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:59,029
palm prints
meant to replicate
the appearance

1114
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:02,099
of a cat's paw.

1115
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:05,002
You could
almost say

1116
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:06,103
that they were
meant to look like

1117
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:10,307
a panther paw.

1118
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,376
A black one.

1119
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:26,323
Ring a bell?

1120
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:31,328
Is this helter skelter?

1121
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:37,434
[Sniffs]

1122
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:47,044
Now's the time
for helter skelter.

1123
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:48,478
Ol' blackie hasn't been able
to do anything

1124
01:05:48,512 --> 01:05:50,247
without whitey
showin' him how.

1125
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,249
So, we're gonna go
ahead and get it started.

1126
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:55,319
What do you
want us to do?

1127
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:57,154
That house.

1128
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:59,189
The one that
son-of-a-bitch melcher
used to live in

1129
01:05:59,223 --> 01:06:00,390
up on cielo drive.

1130
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:04,428
I want you
to go up there.

1131
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,097
That's where
it's gonna begin.

1132
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:21,311
[Sniffles]

1133
01:06:23,413 --> 01:06:25,482
Okay, now,

1134
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:27,417
I want y'all
to leave a sign.

1135
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:30,454
- Sign?
- What kind of a sign?

1136
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:32,456
You know
what I mean.

1137
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:36,126
Somethin' witchy.

1138
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:40,130
[Laughs]

1139
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:00,617
What did he mean?

1140
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,586
About what?

1141
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:05,255
"Do something witchy."

1142
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:07,457
[Laughing]

1143
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:12,829
The sooner it starts,

1144
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:16,433
the sooner we get
our salvation.

1145
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:18,268
I-I don't understand.

1146
01:07:18,302 --> 01:07:21,105
How is driving
into the Hollywood Hills

1147
01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:23,240
gonna start a war?

1148
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:25,275
[Laughing]

1149
01:07:25,309 --> 01:07:28,445
It will.

1150
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:31,648
- Charlie knows it will.
- Yes.

1151
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:36,486
- Helter skelter.
- Helter skelter.

1152
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,189
Helter fuckin' skelter.

1153
01:07:44,194 --> 01:07:47,164
- You know it!
- That's pretty good!

1154
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:50,367
- I needed more wine talking
than my mind talking.
- Yeah, yeah.

1155
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,170
It's the wine
telling the jokes now.

1156
01:07:53,203 --> 01:07:55,472
And on that note,
I'm going to bed.

1157
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:59,109
- Too much wine?
- Ha! That's preposterous.

1158
01:07:59,143 --> 01:08:01,145
Maybe for you, Mr. Sebring,
but I have a feeling

1159
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:03,580
I was up a little bit
earlier than you
this morning.

1160
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:08,352
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know a little
more right now

1161
01:08:08,385 --> 01:08:12,656
than to expect Marlon
to show up on time
for his haircut.

1162
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:16,126
Or to answer the door
in a timely manner.

1163
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,396
-[Laughs] Yes.
- When were you
at Brando's house?

1164
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:23,400
- Shh.
- I'm afraid of being
invited to Brando's house.

1165
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:26,370
- All the stories
I've heard.
- Mm-hmm.

1166
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:29,373
Well, gentlemen, lady.

1167
01:08:29,406 --> 01:08:32,242
It's not a secret
what I'm going to be
dreaming about tonight.

1168
01:08:32,276 --> 01:08:35,212
- Oh!
- [Chuckles]

1169
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:37,214
- Do tell.
- Good night.

1170
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,216
- Night!
- Ooh!

1171
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,536
- Sharon. Sharon!
- What?

1172
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:04,674
How are you doing?
It's been a few days.

1173
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:09,579
Managing...
despite some aches
and pains here and there.

1174
01:09:09,613 --> 01:09:12,616
Oh. When
are you due?

1175
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:13,717
Just a couple
of weeks.

1176
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:17,387
Can you believe it?

1177
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:19,656
- How's Roman doing?
- He's good.

1178
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:22,292
Yeah. He's doing
really well.

1179
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:24,728
He's working a lot.
He's really excited.

1180
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:29,666
- But, um...
- Is he avoiding it?

1181
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:31,735
Why would you say
something like that?

1182
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:33,570
I mean, what's
with all these questions?

1183
01:09:33,603 --> 01:09:36,640
- I'm curious.
- Okay.

1184
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:39,243
All right.
He's very busy.

1185
01:09:39,276 --> 01:09:41,311
He's working on
a lot of important projects.

1186
01:09:41,345 --> 01:09:45,415
He, um...

1187
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:49,586
Look,
everything is fine.

1188
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:52,722
You know?
We're gonna be just fine.

1189
01:10:12,742 --> 01:10:17,514
- Stop.
- [Gunshots]

1190
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:20,550
- What was that?
- You heard that too?

1191
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:22,486
Yeah.

1192
01:10:22,519 --> 01:10:24,688
It sounds like
it's coming from
down the hill.

1193
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:32,529
You go fetch his wallet
out of the car

1194
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,630
and keep watch
around back.

1195
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:36,300
Sure. Sure.

1196
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:38,802
Let's go.

1197
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:31,287
Friend of Jay's?

1198
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:49,673
Who are you?

1199
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:51,708
I'm the devil.

1200
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:55,845
And I'm here
to do the devil's work.

1201
01:12:01,585 --> 01:12:03,887
- Get up!
- What?

1202
01:12:06,523 --> 01:12:08,958
- Shit! [Screams]
- Shut up!

1203
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:11,595

1204
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:14,664

[Bashing]

1209
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:33,817
Tex, what do we
do with these guys?

1210
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,385
Tie these two
together.

1211
01:12:35,419 --> 01:12:36,786
- No. She's pregnant.
- Shut up.

1212
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:39,389
- Just leave her alone.
- Shut up!

1213
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,891
- Please don't do this.
You don't need to do this.
- Just let her go.

It don't matter how much
you fuckin' pigs squeal,

1218
01:12:50,767 --> 01:12:52,502
you're all gonna die.

1219
01:12:52,536 --> 01:12:56,406
So shut up.
Now which one
of you is loaded?

1220
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,742
- Huh?
- [Groans]

1221
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:01,010
Who's got the cash?
Where's the cash?
Where's the money?

1222
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:04,614
- I do.
- Show me where it is.

1223
01:13:04,648 --> 01:13:06,783
- You got it?
- [Sobbing]

1224
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:09,719
- Please just...
-you're not gonna
need it anymore.

1225
01:13:09,753 --> 01:13:12,422
- Please don't do it.
- Show me where it is.
Come on.

1226
01:13:12,456 --> 01:13:14,624

I'll give you money,

1238
01:13:45,822 --> 01:13:47,757
This is all
she fucking has.

1239
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:50,694
This is all
you got?

1240
01:13:50,727 --> 01:13:52,996
Huh?
70 fuckin' dollars?

1241
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:55,732
You ain't got
Hollywood money?

1242
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,066

Please, please stop.

1255
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:11,107

01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:14,911
[Sobbing]

1257
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:21,818
I'm already dead.

1258
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:25,088

1262
01:15:56,085 --> 01:15:59,756
Please, no.

1263
01:15:59,789 --> 01:16:01,691
[Sobbing]
I'm a mom.

1264
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:07,063

- [Stabbing]
- [Groaning]

1266
01:16:16,139 --> 01:16:18,141
I didn't do that, man.

1267
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:21,945
Gary hinman's
house had a similar m.O.

1268
01:16:21,978 --> 01:16:23,713
I didn't do that
either.

1269
01:16:23,747 --> 01:16:24,781
I thought you
were at the scene.

1270
01:16:24,814 --> 01:16:26,950
It's ironic

1271
01:16:26,983 --> 01:16:28,885
that they went
to the house

1272
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,721
that was once occupied
by a record producer

1273
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:35,692
that you claimed
ripped you off
and lied to you.

1274
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:37,694
Look, man.
I wasn't present
at the scene.

1275
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:40,396
- You're tryin'
to implicate me.
- I just want the truth.

1276
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,965
The truth is,
I wasn't there.

1277
01:16:41,998 --> 01:16:43,733
Were you at
the labianca house?

1278
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:45,835
- I didn't kill them either.
- So you were there.

1279
01:16:45,869 --> 01:16:48,104
- I didn't say I was there.
- I didn't ask if you
killed them.

1280
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:49,739
You think
I'm supposed

1281
01:16:49,773 --> 01:16:50,707
to feel something
about that?

1282
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:59,916
Last night was sloppy.
We can't have them
gettin' away.

1283
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:01,985
We can't have
'em screamin'.

1284
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:04,988
Writin'
"pig" on the wall
ain't gonna work,

1285
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:10,093
and helter skelter
ain't gonna begin
if someone gets away.

1286
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,195
I'm gonna show you
how it's done.

1287
01:17:16,165 --> 01:17:19,268
[Man on TV]
Shirt secure.
You take your string

1288
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:22,171
you run it through
hook number one.

1289
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:28,011
[Groans]

1290
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:30,213
What you readin', honey?

1291
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:34,951
That poor girl.
She was seven months
pregnant, too.

1292
01:17:37,053 --> 01:17:39,889
Leno, look at this!

1293
01:17:39,923 --> 01:17:42,058
She was beautiful.

1294
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:45,194
Yeah. No.
Stop here.

1295
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:52,068
Y'all, that's it.

1296
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:55,038
Who lives here?

1297
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,908
Come on.

1298
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:06,015
She was married
to that director,
Roman polanski.

1299
01:18:06,049 --> 01:18:08,251
Polanski?
The horror movie guy?

1300
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:10,486
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1301
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:14,090
- Did we lock up?
- [Knocking]

1302
01:18:21,264 --> 01:18:22,298
It's just gotta be suzan.

1303
01:18:22,331 --> 01:18:23,900
Come on.

[Grunting]

1306
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:37,914
You hear that?

1307
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:41,217
No,
I didn't hear anything.

1308
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,719

What's happening?

1311
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:58,034
You two, you go in there
and you find out.

1312
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:00,870
Go.

1313
01:19:11,114 --> 01:19:12,949
- Drive.
- Where are we going?

1314
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:14,117
You and Sandy
met that actor

1315
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,852
from Lebanon
a couple weeks ago?

1316
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:18,154
- Yeah?
- Head that direction.

1317
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:23,960
- Get out!

1322
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:43,112
Fuck!

[Grunting continues]

1324
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,582
Stop it!
Stay still!

1325
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:52,188
- It's too dull.
- What do you mean?

1326
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:54,190
The knife we brought,
it won't go in.

1327
01:19:54,223 --> 01:19:56,192
- [Grunts]
- Give it to him.

1328
01:20:05,434 --> 01:20:06,836
[Whimpering, screaming]

1329
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:08,271

Just stand still!

1330
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,907
[Rosemary]
Leno! Leno!

1331
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,208
Leno!

[Muffled screams]

1333
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:32,962
Do something.

1334
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:37,967
[Gasping]

1335
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:42,906
Charlie said
he'd do anything for you.

1336
01:20:42,939 --> 01:20:45,074
He said
he would die for you.

1337
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,245
Stab her!

1338
01:20:55,251 --> 01:20:56,986
[Shouts]

1339
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:24,480
You ready for this?

1340
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,253
Okay, you two,
you two go.

1341
01:21:30,286 --> 01:21:32,021
You two go.

1342
01:21:32,055 --> 01:21:33,356
I said, "go."

1343
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:21,470
So, what happened?

1344
01:22:21,504 --> 01:22:23,072
What's it, a secret?

1345
01:22:23,106 --> 01:22:27,043
Nothing,
nothing happened.

1346
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:29,345
He wasn't there.

1347
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:31,047
You sure?

1348
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,315
Knocked on the door
for five minutes,

1349
01:22:32,348 --> 01:22:34,984
nobody answered.

1350
01:22:35,018 --> 01:22:36,385
Well, you sure
you got the right place?

1351
01:22:36,419 --> 01:22:39,388
Yeah, I'm sure.

1352
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:42,225
Okay,
well, let's go.

1353
01:22:51,034 --> 01:22:53,036
Still don't feel anything?

1354
01:22:53,069 --> 01:22:55,471
[Manson]
What, do you want me to cry?

1355
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:57,173
Most people
would be disturbed

1356
01:22:57,206 --> 01:22:58,507
by photographs
like these.

1357
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:04,313
I guess rebels don't cry.

1358
01:23:06,549 --> 01:23:08,517
How many cars
had the people

1359
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:10,353
living with you stolen?

1360
01:23:10,386 --> 01:23:13,222
Stolen?
I never stole any cars.

1361
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:15,058
Is that why
they let you off?

1362
01:23:15,091 --> 01:23:15,924
Are you challenging me?

1363

Anonymous tip?

1390
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:36,632
Yeah, apparently
one of the ranch hands

1391
01:25:36,665 --> 01:25:38,234
didn't like
that we wouldn't share

1392
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:39,502
the girls with him,

1393
01:25:39,535 --> 01:25:41,170
so he lied
when he saw a couple of cars

1394
01:25:41,204 --> 01:25:42,171
on the property.

1395
01:25:42,205 --> 01:25:43,539
He was jealous and greedy.

1396
01:25:43,572 --> 01:25:44,673
I don't like that.

1397
01:25:44,707 --> 01:25:46,709
Nothing wrong
with wanting more.

1398
01:25:46,742 --> 01:25:48,277
It's the American dream.

1399
01:25:48,311 --> 01:25:49,645
That's
what's driving Americans

1400
01:25:49,678 --> 01:25:51,180
to the apocalypse.

1401
01:25:51,214 --> 01:25:53,216
See?
Greed, hate, and jealously.

1402
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:55,784
It's a lot like
when you told everyone

1403
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:57,653
that you were
going to be bigger

1404
01:25:57,686 --> 01:25:59,222
than the Beatles,
isn't it?

1405
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:00,789
- What was that?
- The American dream?

1406
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:02,391
Don't implicate me, man.

1407
01:26:02,425 --> 01:26:03,559
I don't like lies,
and I don't like

1408
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:05,261
the people
that tell them.

1409
01:26:05,294 --> 01:26:07,396
I'm trying to determine
if I can adequately

1410
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:08,631
represent you.

1411
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:10,433
- By demeaning me?
- By analyzing you.

1412
01:26:10,466 --> 01:26:12,435
Look, man, I'm not
a psychiatric patient.

1413
01:26:12,468 --> 01:26:13,669
I'm not a psychiatrist.

1414
01:26:13,702 --> 01:26:15,704
- Don't mess with me, man.
- I'm not.

1415
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:31,787
"When I plunged
the knife in her,

1416
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:35,691
it made me
have an orgasm."

1417
01:26:35,724 --> 01:26:38,761
Those are your words.

1418
01:26:38,794 --> 01:26:42,565
Were you present
at the Tate killings?

1419
01:26:42,598 --> 01:26:43,699
Yes.

1420
01:26:45,468 --> 01:26:48,271
Were you involved?

1421
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:55,544
[Chuckles]
Susan, we got all night.

1422
01:26:55,578 --> 01:26:58,447
Were you involved?

1423
01:26:58,481 --> 01:27:01,384
I got in the car
with everyone.

1424
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:06,322
Charlie told us
to do something witchy.

1425
01:27:06,355 --> 01:27:10,559
He instructed you
to go to cielo drive?

1426
01:27:10,593 --> 01:27:12,395
Yes.

1427
01:27:12,428 --> 01:27:14,330
To kill Sharon Tate?

1428
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,568
Whoever was there.

1429
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:25,708
I went into her bedroom,

1430
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:29,745
brought her
to the living room,

1431
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:32,047
she was...

1432
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,319
Pleading with us
not to kill her.

1433
01:27:38,654 --> 01:27:42,257
She wanted to live
long enough to have her baby.

1434
01:27:46,329 --> 01:27:51,567
She kept crying,
and crying.

1435
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,637
Crying for her mother.

1436
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:56,271
So I stabbed her.

1437
01:28:00,476 --> 01:28:03,779
I tasted her blood.

1438
01:28:03,812 --> 01:28:07,616
It made Charlie happy.

1439
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:09,485
If you're any kind of lawyer,
man,

1440
01:28:09,518 --> 01:28:10,786
you'd be trying
to get me out of here

1441
01:28:10,819 --> 01:28:12,855
instead of asking me
question after question.

1442
01:28:12,888 --> 01:28:14,790
I have to make
a fair assessment of you

1443
01:28:14,823 --> 01:28:16,392
before we go to trial.

1444
01:28:16,425 --> 01:28:17,693
We're not getting
to trial.

1445
01:28:17,726 --> 01:28:20,463
- Why's that?
- I'm a free man.

1446
01:28:20,496 --> 01:28:22,097
Doesn't look
that way to me.

1447
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,433
Well, your perception of free
is different than mine.

1448
01:28:24,467 --> 01:28:25,668

sitting there

and the same briefcase

1450
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:29,605

out there.

is your prison.

about my life?

who you know killed
someone's wife or child,

1459
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:00,936
when you've had
to cross-examine

1460
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:03,806
a young widow
who watched your client

1461
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:06,742
murder her husband
before her very eyes,

1462
01:29:06,775 --> 01:29:10,713
and you tell her
she's wrong.

1463
01:29:10,746 --> 01:29:13,649
I didn't hurt anyone.

1464
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,751
Then why are you here?

1465
01:29:15,784 --> 01:29:20,656
I don't know.
Wrong place, wrong time.

1466
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:22,458
I don't think
I can represent you.

1467

[Scoffs] Why not?
I'm innocent.

Because people
are dead, Charlie!

1475

They're dead
because you sent people

1476
01:29:39,542 --> 01:29:42,010
to their house
to take their lives.

1477
01:29:42,044 --> 01:29:43,612
And why?

1478
01:29:43,646 --> 01:29:46,682
Because you're not
a rock star.

Fuck you man,
fuck you!

Those kids
would do anything for you,

1481
01:29:50,786 --> 01:29:53,489
and you deceived them
and manipulated them

1482
01:29:53,522 --> 01:29:55,824
for your own self-pity!

1483
01:29:55,858 --> 01:29:57,826
And you wonder why
you're here?

1484
01:30:00,863 --> 01:30:04,567
You really think
that these people
are your friends?

1485

1486

We're not family, man.

We're not a cult,
or any other

anyone wants
to put on us, okay?

1490

We're friends.
We're friends.

1491
01:30:16,812 --> 01:30:17,880
They would do anything
for me,

1492
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:19,548
and I would die for them,

1493
01:30:19,582 --> 01:30:20,883
I would die
for those people.

1494
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:23,686

I gave them direction.
