that I see in mainstream culture

180

are ones that are totally
hypersexualized

181

00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,096
What do you mean you're
texting a DC PR guy?

353
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,199
I am starting...

354
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,710
a full-scale
culture revolution.

355
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,110
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

356
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,342
And I need help.

357
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,781
<i>L-l'm-</i>

358
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,040
And listen
before you-

359
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,745
and it involves
a lot of women.

360
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,018
I might be able
to make time.

361
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,079
Look at-look.

362
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,353
How single are...
most of them?

363
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,422
(woman)
<i>I</i> And they took you <i>I</i>

364
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,693
<i>I</i> Right on by <i>I</i>

365
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,097
- So.
- Hey.

366
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,692
Remember when you said
we should get a lawyer

367
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,293
to come with you to your
next topless protest?

368
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,668
Yeah; that
was your idea.

369
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,138
Okay, well,
I looked into it,

370
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,072
and these lawyers who
specialize in freedom of speech

371
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,770
have agreed to represent us
in New York and nationwide.

372
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,574
Oh, my god! Ah!

373
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,773
Freeing nipples
state by state.

374
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,042
Amazing.

375
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,105
One by one.

376
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,482
So are you
gonna do it too?

377
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,542
What?

378
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,609
Go topless.

379
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,417
Oh, my god.

380
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,151
Sure. Maybe. Maybe.

381
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,214
If I'm surrounded
by other women,

382
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,317
but that's not the point, Liv!

383
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,383
Okay, okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry.

384
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,724
So how much is this
gonna cost us?

385
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,457
$3,000 to put them
on retainer,

386
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,192
which is a deal-
believe me.

387
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,631
But where are we
gonna get that money?

388
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,736
Ta-da!

389
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,695
What is that?

390
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,708
Severance check
from the paper.

391
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,765
$5,000.

392
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,839
Consider me your
first investor.

393
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,548
Whoo!

394
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,576
[kissing]

395
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,081
Thank you, With.

396
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,421
You're welcome.

397
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,665
Oh, wow. Uhh...

398
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,429
(Liv)
Uh, do you have any issues with

399
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,459
being topless
in public places?

400
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,664
[laughs]

401
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,229
I made a resolution this year

402
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,174
to try more new,
scary things, so...

403
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,200
that sounds really scary.

404
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,268
Yeah.

405
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,646
It says that you
have special skills.

406
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:31,280
Yeah, um, I know Final Cut,
Excel, Photoshop,

407
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,553
Java, Drupal...

408
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,856
And my grandmother
was a Black Panther.

409
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,123
That's so cool.

410
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,425
<i>Head Malcolm X.</i>

411
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,559
The description says
campaign experience,

412
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,333
film and editing skills wanted,

413
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,567
must be comfortable
with public nudity.

414
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,167
[both laughing]

415
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,371
Um, can I be arrested?

416
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,708
Yeah.

417
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,238
Where do you stand on pasties?

418
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,648
Do you have
any objections

419
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,152
to going undercover inside
government organizations

420
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,451
to free this country from
oppression and censorship?

421
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,423
Fuck yeah.

422
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,891
Do you have any issues

423
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,552
getting topless
in public places?

424
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,492
Thank you.
That's great.

425
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,555
Thank you.

426
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,397
Um, you guys are
both filmmakers.

427
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,632
Oh, l-l'm sorry.

428
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,264
I didn't know you guys
didn't speak English,

429
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,774
but that's great that
you guys are here.

430
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:28,608
I mean, I guess I would have
to tell my husband about it.

431
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,738
My tits are in.

432
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,338
I'm free tomorrow.

433
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,473
That's great.

434
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,179
[laughs]

435
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,243
All right.

436
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,257

It's working.

453
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,286
- Officers, excuse me.
- What's going on here?

454
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,448
These women are my clients,

455
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,015
and we have legal permits
for this demonstration.

456
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:25,893
Now, according
to statute 245.01,

457
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,295
the Court of Appeals
of New York has ruled

458
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,732
that the exposure
of a bare female breast

459
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,758
violates no exposure laws.

460
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:37,536
And so on behalf of my clients,
for violation of this statute,

461
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,372
I'm officially issuing you
a lawsuit.

462
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,811
For their wrongful arrest
on Wall Street,

463
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:46,372
September the 15th of 2012.

464
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,029
Suing them for
'IO million, huh'?

465
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,904
I mean, it was
just a PR stunt.

466
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,101
It'll probably
get thrown out.

467
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,810
Our lawyers thought
it would-

468
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,836
it would lure the press
into covering it.

469
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:17,972
Should've called me.

470
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,346
What do you mean?

471
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,749
Well, you know I would've
leaked it to Reuters.

472
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,753
In seconds, you could've
been out to 150 countries

473
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,119
in 6O languages.

474
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,088
I think you are tapping into
the first-and probably most-

475
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,789
important amendment
to the constitution:

476
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,560
Freedom of religion,
freedom of speech,

477
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:36,622
press, assembly.

478
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:41,126
Do you know that we are 37th
in the press freedom index?

479
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,135
There are 36 other countries

480
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,705
that have a freer press
than we do.

481
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,437
36.

482
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,500
Who's the worst?
North Korea?

483
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,537
Eritrea.

484
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,603
It's a little
tiny country

485
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,080
in East Africa
near the Red Sea.

486
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,711
Jim.

487
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,981
I know that you're-
that you're crazy busy,

488
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,488
but we need somebody
who knows this world,

489
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,582
somebody that can help us
connect the dots.

490
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,594
We need a consigliere,
a Yoda.

491
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:05,856
A Yoda?

492
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,022

493
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,395
Big shoes to fill.

00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:13,698
I just don't know
how this is gonna sit

495
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,760
in the big, bad world.

496
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,435
Yeah.

497
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,840
How's the paper?

498
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,641
Oh, I'm done working
for dinosaurs.

499
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,771
You quit.

500
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,907
No, I got fired.

501
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,577

Okay, With,
here's what I can do.

504
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,788
Let me percolate on it.

505
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,125
If something
sifts to the top,

506
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,528
I'll give you a buzz.

507
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:41,587

what are you coloring'?

518
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,522
(Liv)
I'm color-coding the states

519
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,924
that women can legally
be topless in.

520
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,519
(With)
How many states in America

521
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,724
is the nipple actually legal?

522

Well, it's a list of 32
good-and bad-guys

as of now.

Katie Couric?

00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,508
For a campaign
of this magnitude,

531
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,209
we're gonna need to
form a coalition

532
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,013
of like-minded organizations

533
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,247
and reach out to
high-profile people

534
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,955
who will champion
our cause in the media.

535
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,786
How do you expect us
to just reach out

536
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,190
to these huge,
iconic names?

537
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,024
Easy; we just call
their handlers-

538
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,963
their humans-and say,
"Hey, we are on the front lines

539
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,260
"fighting for your freedom.

540
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,523
"You don't want to give us

541
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,727
"ten minutes
of your client's time?

542
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,702
Then let karma fall
where it may."

543
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:54,999
That's a really
nice theory,

544
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,802
but back here on Earth,
what makes you think

545
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,672
these people are even
gonna talk to us?

546
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,770
Cali, everyone in the world
is hungry for something real.

547
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,542
Our currency is meaning.

548
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:05,775
You're joking, right'?

549
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,044
No, I'm not joking.

550
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,676
I mean, even icons-

551
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,277
icons who have everything
in the world-

552
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,817
at the end of the day,
they realize

553
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,151
all they have
is themselves.

554
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,816
They want meaning
in their lives.

555
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,985
It's the only thing
that they can't buy,

556
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,085
but we can give it to them.

What meeting?

560
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,697
Uh, that meeting
with the investors.

561
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,702
Oh-oh, with the investor.

562
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:26,964
Yeah. Okay, great.

563
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,096
So I'll see you guys later.

564
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,232
See (Liv)
you guys.

565
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,298
What do you think?

566
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,874
Maybe I'll take, like-

567
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,106
That girl
is a button-pusher.

568
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,808
It's not her.
It's her programming.

569
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,111
She just needs a new
operating system.

570
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,617
Well, she's a
contradictarian.

571
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,914
She's working
her ass off for free.

572
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,716
Whatev; she cannot
be talking to us like that

573
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:45,778
in front of the peeps.

00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,845

00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,221

Sorry. I just love quotes.

<i>(Cali) You know I
appreciate your optimism,</i>

618
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,668
but you do realize
that societies and religions

619
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,142
have been oppressing women
for countless millennia.

00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,372
This is not going
to change overnight.

I hope you
know that.

622
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,943
Yeah, but you know what,
you have to remember

623
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,347
that humans and animals

624
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,180
and even bugs
at a deep DNA level-

625
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,241
they want to be free.

as to why you think

that you-we can
change something

Why us? Why now?
What makes us so unique?

00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,825
We live
in a technological age

632
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,229
of social media,
where one idea

633
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,029
can reach more people
in one week

634
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,831
than Jesus, Buddha,
or Moses could reach

635
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,097
in over thousands
of years.

636
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,798
Let's be careful
comparing ourselves

637
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,329
to Buddha and Jesus, okay?

638
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,807
Besides, that's
all relative.

639
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,173
There are way more
people on this Earth now

640
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,472
than there were
5,000 years ago.

641
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,974
Yeah, but at the rate
you can reach people

642
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,036

the millions.

643
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,139

happened in Egypt.

644
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,444
That started
with one guy

645
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:27,711
and one Facebook page.

646
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,377
I'm not sure how accurate
that statement is,

647
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,284
but listen.

648
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,186
In political
movements especially,

649
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,088
the lines between
delusion and reality

650
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,456
can become very blurry.

651
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,724
So how about I will
stay realistic,

652
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,389
and you two
stay optimistic,

653
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,490

in the middle.

Yes, I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

709
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,473
Burt sends me video.
Very good.

710
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,007
I like.
So you need money?

711
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,576
<i>Oh, uh, yeah.</i>

712
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,145
Money would be great.

713
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,384
How much you need
and what you need this for?

714
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,885
[soft rock music]

715
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,896
(man)
<i>I</i> I want to be out <i>I</i>

716
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,261
Here's what you're up against.

717
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:32,325
In 1980,
religious organizations

718
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,530
mobilized and put Reagan
in the White House.

719
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,473
Basically, from that moment,
the Republicans made an alliance

720
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,034
with the Christian right,
and when puritans

721
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,536
start manipulating politicians
and hijacking government,

722
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,380
that's when censorship laws
get weird.

723
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,181
Here's how it works:

724
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:55,055
Let's say there is a television
show like Skins,

725
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,559
where you have teenagers
having sex,

726
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,425
ingesting drugs,
etcetera, etcetera.

727
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,554
I like that show.

728
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,464
Here's why it's no longer
on in the U.S.:

729
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:08,028
Groups like the PTO
rally their religious base,

730
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,165
send e-mails and phone calls
to DC, to the <i>FCC,</i>

731
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,506
to the press, to the networks,
and, in Skins' case, MTV.

732
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,274
The sponsors freak out.

733
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,372
They pull their ads.

734
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,939
MTV freaks out.

735
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,042
No more money?

736
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,714
Puritanical ideology,
meet commerce.

737
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,116
Shows off the air.

738
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,988
But Jim, how do we
go up against

739
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,424
these huge Goliath
institutions?

740
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,155
I mean, I just
feel that we're

741
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:33,355
slightly outgunned here.

742
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,160
Okay; first thing
you have to understand is

743
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:39,327
this is not about fighting.

744
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,530
I'm pretty sure she
meant metaphorically.

745
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,165
Metaphorically,
literally,

746
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,732
you got to forget
about this idea of fighting.

747
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,969
Whatever you fight
grows stronger.

748
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,106
That's very Zen of you,
but I'm asking

749
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,514
how do we change the
censorship laws in America?

750
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,480
This is not about politics.

751
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:02,651
This is about the hearts
and minds of the people.

752
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,387
You want to
shake things up,

753
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,759
take a page out of the Christian
right's book.

754
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:11,058
Use the same tactics they employ
on your cause.

755
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,730
We're a product of this
puritanical culture,

756
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,602
but let me ask you this:

757
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,005
who do you think runs the world?

758
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,100
(Cali)
The 1%.

759
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,508
No.

760
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,512
The Illuminati.

761
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:27,346
No. You do.

762
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,181
The people.

763
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,517
When the masses align,

764
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,716
Rome falls, Egypt falls,
it all falls down.

765
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,781
In theory, but-

766
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,291
No, not in theory.
In real time.

767
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,797
What do you think all those
little religious groups

768
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,092
across the great unwashed
are made of?

769
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,602
A bunch of people.

770
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:56,273
What you need is a
state-of-the-art campaign

771
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,302
that will be the
butterfly wing

772
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,576
that will trigger
the tsunami

773
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,743
of signatures
to petitions.

774
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:06,051
You drive to Washington
via social media.

775
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,318
When you reach
your critical mass,

776
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,654
I'll take care
of the press.

777
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,752
CNN, Fox, BBC.

778
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,422
I'll make a few
phone calls,

779
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,831
and suddenly, the great
media monster's eyes

780
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,798
will turn toward you...

781
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,805
for 15 minutes.

782
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,535
Maybe 15 seconds.

783
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,372
In that moment...

784
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,705
What are you gonna say?

785
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,481
We researched the name
"Topless Warriors,"

786
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,543
and it's already been taken
by some group in Russia.

787
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,077
What?

788
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,147
Are you fucking my tits?

789
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,214
Orson!

790
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,281
Hey. What's up?

791
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:44,850
Talk to me.
Who are these girls?

792
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,721
Uh, these are Femen.

793
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,822
According to this site,
they have over 300 members.

794
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,594
And they protested issues
ranging from

795
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,430
the plight
of the Ukrainian prostitute

796
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,266
to the election
of President Putin.

797
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,169
Wow. These humans are hardcore.

798
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,229
How did they get
so much press?

799
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,296
They're smart.

800
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,808
They target high-profile,
international events

801
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,310
like Davos and elections.

802
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,367
They hit the Vatican.

803
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,435
Wow.

804
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,606
- We need to do that.
- What?

805
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,308
Storm high-profile
landmarks

806
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,112
with thousands
of topless women.

807
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,141
What's equivalent
to the Vatican in America?

808
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,414
St. Patrick's Cathedral?

809
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,477
Probably the
White House, right?

810
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,614
Yes!
We need to invade DC.

811
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,386
Uh, With, can I talk to you
just for a second?

812
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,449
Yeah.

813
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,120
Uh, we're gonna
go get some food.

814
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,185
Would you guys
want anything?

815
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,720
Yeah.
Could you grab some Dunkaroos?

816
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,163
Du n karoos'?
What's that'?

817
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,326
It's the cookie
with the kangaroo.

818
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,494
They're shaped
in a kangaroo,

819
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,867
and you drop
them into the-

820
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,872
The kangaroojumps
into the cream.

821
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,339
It's like the little, um...

822
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,774
[all speaking at once]

823
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,277
I know what they are.
Come on.

825
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,142
(Orson) Get whatever
varieties they have.

826
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,204
Chocolate and vanilla.

827
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,148
And some-some
string cheese.

828
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,341
We should try
to get in touch

829
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,547
with that porn star
that's in parliament too.

830
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,224
(With)
Whatfi up'?

831
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,666
- Nothing.
- Come on.

832
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,865
Well, we have
a problem.

833
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:03,929
Yeah.

834
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,334
- Roz, tell her.
- What is it?

835
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,398
[sighs]

836
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,410
L-I ran the numbers
and the invoices

837
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,912
and the receipts,
and as of now,

838
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,348
we're down to $397.21.

839
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:18,411
And, girls, if we're seriously
planning on producing a campaign

840
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,423
with thousands of women in DC,
we're gonna need real money,

841
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,585
or this whole thing
is going to fall apart.

842
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,617
(Liv) Okay; the universe is
not going to fall apart,

843
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:27,686
chicken little.

844
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,527
The universe has a plan.

845
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,261
In quantum physics,
they have proven

846
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,859
that space and time
are illusions.

847
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,371
So if time doesn't
really exist,

848
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:40,342
then the impact that we
are going to make-

849
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,468
we've
already made-

850
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,705
and everything that we
are going to do,

851
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:43,768
we've already done.

852
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,407
Liv, I don't need the
Carl Sagan explanation.

853
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,781
All I need to know
is do we have money?

854
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,683
Because, like, the wall-

855
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,914
We're at it.

856
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:57,782
<i>'LNL</i>

857
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:58,850
[laughs]

858
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,328
I have to start
looking for a job.

859
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,661
Seriously; I'm not
even kidding anymore.

860
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,526
We're in the middle
of a revolution.

861
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,830
You can't get a job.

862
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,632
I have to pay rent
in four days,

863
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:09,967
and my phone's about
to get cut off.

864
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,769
With, you cannot afford

865
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,571
the luxury of a negative
thought right now.

866
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:16,340
We-we're out of money,
and we need a plan.

867
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,449
Well, Cali had
an idea, but, well...

868
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,713
But what?

869
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,812
All right, well,
you know those websites

870
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,254
where you can
upload a video

871
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,416
to get people to care
about your cause,

872
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,481
and they can donate to you?

873
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,548
- Yeah, like Kickstarter.
- Yeah, exactly.

874
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,561
Well, we could
make a viral video

875
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,857
right now if we wanted to.

876
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:34,919
We've got iPhones.

877
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,590
And shoot what?

878
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,725
All right.

879
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,295
Heads, I run topless
through Times Square

880
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,362
and you film.

881
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,272
Tails, you run topless
through Times Square

882
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,332
and I film you.

883
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,639
No. No. No.

884
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:51,908
I mean, in front

885
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,347
But in front of
complete strangers?

886
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:54,941
I mean, that's in my
top ten worst fears ever,

887
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,451
right next to
being buried alive.

888
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,953
No.

889
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,386
No what?

890
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,684
No.

891
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,657
You know, you can't
be halfway pregnant.

892
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,887
You can't be
half-committed, either.

893
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,451
What's it gonna be?

894
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,519
Yes or no?

895
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,802

It's bad.

938
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,186
They're charging her
with disturbing the peace,

reckless assault.

940
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,954
Reckless assault?
For what?

941
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,015
How much is the bail?

942
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,220

Is there any way around paying
for this permit, Jim'?

948
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,707

That's brilliant.

00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,146
There's no guarantee

958
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:28,991

00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,566
Yes.

961
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,734
(man)
We require a 10% deposit,

962
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:43,210
so for you, that's $2,500.

963
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,147
As soon as we-you know, as soon
as we get the check from you,

964
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,649
we can get her out of there.

965
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,979
- Thanks.
- Yep.

966
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,815
[car horn blaring]

967
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,650
Roz, how much money
do we have in the bank?

968
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,984
The next check
just cleared.

969
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,581
It's, like, $1,500.

970
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,718
You cannot use that money
for bail.

971
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:58,886
That money is for DC.

972
00:41:58,916 --> 00:41:59,951
We're getting her out.

973
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,055
She's the reason this
whole thing started.

974
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,224
I should be the one
in jail.

975
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,961
So you're just gonna
jeopardize our entire plan

976
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,195
to get Liv out of jail?

977
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,194
No. There's another way.

978
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,729
We can get permits for free.

979
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:12,866
What are you talking about?

980
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,899
I spoke to Jim, and he said
that if we get museums

981
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,206
to sponsor us, we'll be fine.

982
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,974
And if we can't?

983
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,282
Then that's-that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

984
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,676
Okay, look.

985
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,051

986
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:27,248
We all love Liv.

987
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,189
This is much bigger
than her now.

988
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,886
Okay?
You cannot do this.

989
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,191
I'm not letting her stay
in jail one more hour,

990
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,321
and that's final.

991
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,056
That's final?

992
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,294
Who says?

993
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,633
I say. Not happy?

You know what?
That's a good idea.

do right now.

00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:58,810
We need her.

1002
00:42:58,842 --> 00:42:59,877
We don't need Cali.

1003
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,945
We need Liv.

1004
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,657

the halftime speech,

is in jail indefinitely.

It's not dead.

1015
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,684

why you hired me?

00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,990
I don't know,
'cause you're cool

1018

read my resume.

This is what I do.

1023
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,828
Liv is a political prisoner.

1024
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,363
This is more than enough
to get people together

1025
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,670
to throw a bail party.

00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,441
democratize the internet.

1062
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:35,000
We're trying to just
kill censorship

1063
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,238
once and for all
in this country.

1064
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:37,336
And the leader
of our movement

1065
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,005
got arrested
for a public stunt.

1066
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,811
- Yes.
- And bail is $25,000.

1067
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:41,873
Whoa.

1068
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,077
So we're trying to raise
some money to get her out.

1069
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,142
Awesome.

1070
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,209
Why don't I get you a drink?
Do you want a drink?

1071
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,277
Let me get you drink.

1072
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,449

1083
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,898
So, tell about Revolution.

1084
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,272
It's not exactly
a revolution, see,

We want to
transcend that.

1091
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,145
It's time to evolve.

1092
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,551
Yeah, this is more
of an evolution.

1093
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,811

I'm gonna take her away
for a moment...

1099
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,955
- Okay.
- If that's okay with you.

1100
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,194

Hi. How are you doing?

1105
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:42,509

that revolution?

1109
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,974
We raised $450,

1110
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,318
but her bail's $25,000.

1111
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:54,583
We still have
to pay the bond

1112
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,052
and hire a lawyer.

1113
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,221
No. No, no, no.

helped me out so much.

for 10,000 topless
women to assemble

1203

in any possible way.

- Wow.
- Wow.

1213
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,348
But there's a problem.

1214
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,414
What's the problem?

1215
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:24,755
Yeah, what's-

1216
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,283
What's your identity?

1217

You don't like it?

1221
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,861
I mean, it's
a catchy phrase.

1222
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,626
I don't mean to offend,
but it's a tagline.

1223
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,137
It's not an identity.

1224

It's for our DC speech.

- Hugh Hefner.

00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,152
What?

1414
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,719
It's over.

1415
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,095
I fucked this up.

1416
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,155
It's okay, okay?

1417
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,222
We'll figure
something else out.

1418
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:21,201
You know?
Forget DC.

1419
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,067
This is all my fault.

1420
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:25,003
[sighs]

1421
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,676
With, look at me.

1422
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,906
Look at me.

1423
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,852
I feel like I'm letting
everybody down, you know?

1424
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:42,588
You didn't let me down.

1425
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:57,633
Sorry.

1426
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,209
It's-um.

1427
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,809
I don't know
why I did that.

1428
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,845
That was really weird.

1429
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:17,915
I wasn't, like, um,
planning on doing that

1430
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,188
or anything.

1431
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:22,787
Where are you going?

1432
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:24,196
Uh, I'm going out.

1433
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:29,360
With, you still have
a towel on your head.

1434
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:33,068

not wearing shoes.

1436
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,304
Sorry.

1437
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:46,909
Cali, who's your
contact in DC?

1438
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:47,978
Give me the number.

1439
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,046
I want to call them.

1440
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,922
What is it that you think
you're going to accomplish?

1441
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:54,758
Cali, please
give me the number.

1442
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:56,923
Look; I don't know how many
times I have to tell you this.

1443
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,058
Everything is booked,
and even if it wasn't,

1444
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,795
we can't get permits.

1445
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,860
Organizing thousands
of topless women

1446
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:04,894
costs a shitload of money
we don't have.

1447
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:06,736
Uh, pardon me
for a second.

1448
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,106
We're looking for
eyeballs, right?

1449
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:09,166
(Cali)
Obviously.

1450
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:10,836
Well, so I mean,
how do you get attention

1451
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,107
in this day and age, you know?

1452
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:14,877
Just, like, get some sort
of viral hit count

1453
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:18,875
Bieber, Gangnam Style,
cat baby thing, right?

1454
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:20,744
No, no, no, no.

1455
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,256
You are not suggesting
we are doing a music video.

1456
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:24,224
I'm not, but it's
a valid art form.

1457
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,158
Look; what I'm saying
is what do you do

1458
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,286
when you have an
important message

1459
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:28,693
that you want to get
out to the people?

1460
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:29,753
(Charlie) Ooh, you update
your Facebook status.

1461
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:31,163
Okay, but to more people.

1462
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,962
You know? To the world.

1463
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,332
If you want to announce
you're running for president...

1464
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,392
Press conference.

1465
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,200
Hold a press conference.
Exactly.

1467
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:39,967
So you've got your friend
Jim, right?

1468
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,031
He's got the press
in his pocket.

1469
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,372
Why don't we put
all that together

1470
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:43,877
and grab a microphone...

1471
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,208
But why would
anyone else care?

1472
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,441
Yeah, no one's gonna give
three shits about some speech.

1473
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:48,710
No offense.

1474
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:49,773
Yeah. It's true.

1475
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,376
Unless you're topless.

1476
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,409
Well, what's the hook?

1477
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,480
Okay, what would be
so undeniable

1478
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,714
that the press would
have to cover it?

1479
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:58,782
(Liv)
Wait.

1480
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,959
This is the perfect opportunity
for us to just

1481
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:08,025
wreak some serious
street-art havoc.

1482
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:09,192
Can we define
havoc quickly?

1483
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,260
Before this goes-

1484
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,328
And we don't have
any bail money.

1485
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,395
Just hear me out.
It's just a thought.

1486
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:14,169
What if, on Halloween,
while the cops are busy,

1487
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:18,145
we got Kilo and Elle
to just go out on the street

1488
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:21,205
and paste Free
the Fucking Nipple everywhere.

1489
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,911
So that when everybody wakes up
on November 1st,

1490
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,010
it's like the first snow.

1491
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,247
Yes. Yes.

1492
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:27,310
I like where you're
going with this.

1493
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:28,378
- Keep going.
- Okay. Great.

1494
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,823
And then the next day,
we hold a press conference,

1495
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:33,885
and we take full responsibility
for the terrorist act.

1496
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,395
(With)
lfucking love it. I love it.

1497
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,988
I'm gonna-l'm gonna
call Jim right now.

1498
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,259
I'm on it, guys.

1502
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:45,002
Jim, did you-
did you read my speech?

1503
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:46,062
<i>Yeah.</i>

1504
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,133
The topless thing
is the Trojan horse,

1505
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,372
but the real dialogue
that's happening

1506
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,936
is about violence.

1507
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,209
[sighs]

1508
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,478
<i>Your movement
is becoming poignant.</i>

1509
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:57,780
Great. Thank you.

1510
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:58,842
Well, let me off the phone.

1511
01:02:58,875 --> 01:02:59,910
I got some calls to make.

1512
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,182
Okay, cool. Thank you.

Yeah, it's Jim.

1518

1519
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,567

Come check this out.

1524
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,504
I edited some
stuff together.

1525
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:27,572
It's-it's very rough,
but it can give you

1526
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,080
sort of a general idea
of what is going on.

1527
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:31,585
Oh, that's-
you finished it.

1528
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:32,843
- It's not finished.
- Everyone!

1529
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:34,286
- No, it's not finished.
- People! Humans!

Orson just
finished the cut.

1532
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,248
It's a rough
cut, though.

1533
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:41,023
Not finished, so don't
judge too harshly.

1534
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,462
Wait. There.

1535
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,360
We live in oppressive times.

1536
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,962
We, as a nation,
become our own thought.

1537
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:54,338
Jesus Christ is one of the most
historic victims of censorship,

1538
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:55,933
and Pontius Pilate
was his censor.

1539
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,171
And even more disturbing,
every-

1540
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,508

1541
01:03:58,534 --> 01:03:59,569
And even more disturbing...

1542
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,548
Concern for commercial
viability...

1543
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:03,915
Pontius Pilate was his censor.

1544
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,477
And if you hate freedom,
move to China.

1545
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,955
Censorship, censorship,
censorship

1546
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:13,950
is an obvious hallmark of any
fascist, tyrannical regime.

01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:31,574
Yeah.

1556
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:34,477
It is.

1557
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:38,974
Oh, and we have to
call a lawyer

1558
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:40,919
to arrange for some
bail money,

1559
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:43,389

is definitely-

1560
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:45,255
definitely
getting arrested.
