1
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,827
Another punishment is waiting for her.

2
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,798
Such disgrace.

3
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,342
Who would have thought
when my son married her...

4
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,937
she would one day bring such disgrace
to his memory.

5
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:57,009
Even now she's in there,
putting on that powder.

6
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,278
God's watching her. God will punish her.

7
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,980
this shall not go on. I shall forbid it.

8
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,216
It's gone on long enough.
Grushenka, you hear me?

9
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,780
It's gone on too long.

10
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,384
Don't you worry, Mama. God will punish her.

11
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,165
Well, your aunt and I have discussed it.
We've decided, haven't we, Vera?

12
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,293
We're going to make her stop,
and if she won't, then we cast her out.

13
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,358
Isn't that right, Vera?

14
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,928
Don't think about it anymore, Mama,
and don't worry yourself.

15
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,098
You'll only distress yourself.

16
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,641
God will punish her for what she's doing.

17
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,008
It's you who'll be punished.
Why do you talk that way about Mama?

18
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,309
Why do you always say
horrible things about her?

19
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,316
Oh, silence, child. Silence.
You don't understand these things.

20
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,373
Thank God you don't.

21
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,888
If Mama didn't have to go out to work,
then you would have to go instead.

22
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,547
Then who would be the wicked one?

23
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,955
-Katya.
-Oh, silence.

24
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,721
-Where do you think you're going, child?
-I want to go and play.

25
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,388
No. She wants to play
with those frightful Jews downstairs.

26
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,160
-That's what you want to do, child?
-Let me go.

27
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,393
-Can I go downstairs, Mama?
-Yes, of course.

28
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,203
You shouldn't touch her
when you're going to your work.

29
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,577
But Katya is right, isn't she, Grusha?

30
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,305
If I didn't earn money for us,
it would be you who'd have to...

31
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,883
find a way.
And it wouldn't be so easy for you.

32
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,522
Then play something else.
You don't have to play that all the time.

33
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,492
Play whatever you want.

34
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,460
Oh, hello. Your daughter just came down,
did you know?

35
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,929
I know. I hope you don't mind.

36
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,466
Send her back upstairs
when you've had enough of her.

37
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,867
Would you like to stay for a moment?
Look at those rascals.

38
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,271
-I'll make you some tea.
-No, no, no. I must go. I'll be late.

39
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,242
-Thank you.
-Well, take care of yourself.

40
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,274
This city can be dangerous at night.

41
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,110
Oh, I can take care of myself. Bye.

42
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,014
Goodbye.

43
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,167
Do you speak French?

44
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,272
Of course you do.

45
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,178
Come on, say something.

46
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,579
This part of town, it's so dull.

47
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,686
Come to the French district.
It's much more fun.

48
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,092
There's more enjoyment, more laughter.

49
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,856
Come on.

50
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,200
Come with me. I'll pay you enough.

51
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,868
You won't regret it.

52
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,502
I'm expected at my work.

53
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,809
They won't miss you tonight.

54
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,739
I'm a rich man.

55
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,748
Really?
I didn't know rich men rode the tram.

56
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,584
Everyone rides the tram.

57
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,249
I saw T.V. Soong himself
on the tram the other night.

58
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,228
Besides, I have a limousnie.

59
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,730
It's waitnig just here. At this next stop.

60
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,494
A chauffeur, everything.

61
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,463
Get off and I'll take you where you're going.

62
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,809
Come on.

63
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,532
Some other time...

64
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,127
Hey, don't go!

65
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,404
We have to. We have to stick together.

66
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,709
And not just because we're Russians.
That's not the only reason.

67
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,994
...every time you're with him nit's Victor.

68
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,463
-Victor?
-Yes.

69
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,732
Well, hello again.

70
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:17,105
-How's your little one?
-Better, thank you. Much better now.

71
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,813
That one.
She went back with that German last night.

72
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,111
I knew she would.
She might as well be on the streets.

73
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,549
That's the third time this week.

74
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,217
You'll sit with me tonight, won't you?

75
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,756
It's a disgrace
the way some of these girls behave.

76
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,528
Have they no shame at all?

77
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,691
Isn't it the same for all of us?
You and me, too?

78
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:46,162
If you mean Monsieur Verdurni,
you know that was different.

79
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,666
And for you, too.

80
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:54,011
You're passionate. Love sweeps you away.

81
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,041
We're women, we can't help that.

82
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,915
Masha, all of us here have to fall in love
from time to time.

83
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,880
To feed our children...

84
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,184
and our mothers and our sisters.

85
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,561
Please, please sit with me.

86
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,655
Don't worry. I'll sit with you. It's all right.

87
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,678
Hey, hey, hey...

88
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,079
I told you to get a new dress.

89
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,709
Yes, I found one,
but the shop is keepnig it for me.

90
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,757
That's what you sand last week.
You look shabby.

91
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,056
Sorry. I'll have it tomorrow for sure.

92
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,662
Remember, I've warned you.

93
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,086
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

94
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,861
Don't you know what time it ns?
Stop the chat!

95
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,300
Lights!

96
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,769
Hey. You are sitting in wrong place.

97
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,774
I well understand Mr. Robertson's fears.

98
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,010
And he is, of course,
quite right to express them.

99
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,381
I might ask the same questions.

100
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,010
I can only emphasize...

101
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:12,819
that the problems
concerning our consignments of tea...

102
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,859
are not of great relevance.

103
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,762
Our volume of trade in textiles
remanis by far...

104
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,924
the largest in the Far East...

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,264
and we continue to enjoy...

106
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,360
Yeah.

107
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:29,672
...the special esteem in which we
and our whole history out here are held.

108
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,111
Absolutely.

109
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,145
The Japanese always like to posture.

110
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,818
In this case, I don't feel
they really mean anythnig much by nt.

111
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,328
It's just a show of strength.

112
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,092
What we might call samuran bravado.

113
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,026
Oh, Jackson, the very man.

114
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,561
We were just discussnig
the intentions of the Japanese.

115
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,702
Perhaps you'd care to enlighten us.

116
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,336
I'm afraid I've no insights
to offer you whatsoever.

117
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,904
These days I only know what my man
reads to me from the newspaper...

118
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:14,112
and I try not to have him do that any more
than is strictly necessary.

119
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:18,182
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I wish you all a pleasant evening.

120
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,549
-Good night.
-Good night.

121
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,220
Thank you, I'll manage. Good evening.

122
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,491
-Pleased to meet--
-Pardon me.

123
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,301
I think it's time
for a tearful parting of the ways...

124
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,601
between Mr. Jackson and the old firm.

125
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,336
We can hardly cast him off just yet, old man.

126
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,934
Not after what happened to him.

127
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,211
I'm all right.

128
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:52,215
I'd like to go to the little club, please, Liu,
and then on to Del Monte's.

129
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,854
The door is here.

130
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,855
Thank you.

131
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,604
Excuse me.

132
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,544
Excuse me. Excuse me.

133
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,274
-Mr. Jackson.
-Thomas.

134
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,013
My, my, this is a surprise.

135
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,285
I didn't expect to meet you
in a place like this.

136
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,049
We better keep this from your dad, eh?

137
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,856
I came to look for you, sir.

138
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,420
I thought you might want a little company.

139
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,567
Oh, that's good of you.

140
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,898
Mr. Jackson, what are you doing here?
A place like this.

141
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,177
this is a dive.

142
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:46,900
Dive?

143
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,281
Well, this establishment here, Thomas,
may not be perfect.

144
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,448
Oh, no, it's not perfect at all.

145
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,647
In my opinion, it's a mighty impressive
little place all the same.

146
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:00,385
Mr. Jackson, a man of your fine reputation--

147
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:04,293
this is Shanghai, Thomas.
A person can do much as he pleases.

148
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,695
-But I think you might be more comfortable--
-Thomas, my friend...

149
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,360
why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

150
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,866
I don't like you wandernig around
these parts of town.

151
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,929
I feel kind of responsable for you
on account of your dad.

152
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,602
Anything happens to you here,
I feel I would have to answer to him.

153
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,944
Now go on home to bed.
Me, I've got a few things still to do up here.

154
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,309
Well, then.

155
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,486
-Good night, sir.
-Good night, Thomas.

156
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,321
Pardon me.

157
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,923
Excuse me.

158
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,265
-How are you?
-Fine. How are you?

159
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,938
-Fine.
-Dragon, please.

160
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,004
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

161
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,839
Please forgive me, sir,
but I couldn't help overhearing.

162
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,944
That young man, he is your protege?

163
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,983
No, hardly.

164
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,647
He, like most people, fanls to see...

165
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,289
all there is to see.

166
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:14,123
Myself, I tend to agree
with your assessment.

167
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,262
this establishment is not perfect...

168
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:23,100
but it is certanily one of the best
Shanghai has to offer at this moment.

169
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:47,595
I believe, sir,
I've seen you around here before.

170
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,461
It's very possible.
We have nothing to match this in Japan.

171
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,567
Not even in Tokyo.

172
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,572
Shanghan these days is remarkable.

173
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,577
It has several places
of comparable standard.

174
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,476
These places you say
are of a comparable standard...

175
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:09,954
-just which ones did you have in mind?
-Not far from here, there is the Navy Bar.

176
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,286
-Navy Bar.
-I personally fnid it very interesting.

177
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,690
Then there is the Wha Kim
in the French Concession.

178
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,353
And perhaps...

179
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,366
the Last Chance in Foochow road.

180
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,267
Myself, I'd add the Ching Lieng to that list.

181
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,134
Ching Lieng, I wonder--

182
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,037
Ching Lieng isn't so much to your taste?

183
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:33,010
It is very interesting,
but in my personal opinion...

184
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,005
perhaps not at quite the same level as...

185
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:42,349
-well, for instance, here.
-You may be right.

186
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,319
But I like him very much.

187
00:13:56,368 --> 00:14:00,771
I'm pleased
to make your acquanitance, Mr....

188
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,369
-Matsuda.
-Matsuda.

189
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:07,139
And you, sir.
I believe you are Mr. Todd Jackson.

190
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,308
The distinguished American diplomatist.

191
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,875
Not so distinguished.

192
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,854
The same Todd Jackson, I believe...

193
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:20,221
whom the English Foreign Minister
once referred to as...

194
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,962
-the last hope for the League of Nations.
-That was all a few years back.

195
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,157
A lot's happened since then.

196
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:32,263
I have no quarrel with your countrymen
anymore, Mr. Matsuda.

197
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,600
Or with anybody else.

198
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,804
Besides, I came in here
to get away from all of that.

199
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,304
I quite agree, Mr. Jackson.

200
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:46,551
In a place like this, we should be allowed
to forget the world outside...

201
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,646
and its many diffniculties.

202
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,587
At least until the morning.

203
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,787
Hey, I bet you've never been in this place.
Come on.

204
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,258
-Where?
-Here. Let me show you somethnig.

205
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,131
The bouncers here, they're no good.

206
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,497
Now listen to that.
In the bar of my dreams, Mr. Matsuda...

207
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,162
I'd have the best team of bouncers in town...

208
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:40,796
and in the whole of Asia.

209
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,000
They'd be hand-picked,
and they'd be well trained.

210
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,771
Only then can you have control. See that?

211
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,580
The bouncers are like your dials, you know.
You control the mood with them.

212
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,483
You can turn it this way or turn it that way.

213
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:59,252
with a good team of bouncers, a fellow, you
could conduct the place like an orchestra.

214
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,976
Do you know, Mr. Jackson...

215
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,411
the establishment I would most
like to visit just now?

216
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,948
No. Which is that?

217
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,049
this bar of yours.

218
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,345
this bar of your dreams.

219
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,692
Well, who knows? Maybe one day you will.

220
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,990
I'm not a rich man,
but I've got a little stored away.

221
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,297
Now, sometimes I think about it.

222
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,064
So you may really build this establishment?

223
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,338
this bar of your dreams?

224
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,237
right now, I don't have enough...

225
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,471
but, you know, in a town like this,
you can have a stroke of luck, and then....

226
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:56,071
I thnik about getting up one morning
and taking every dollar I have...

227
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,015
and going out and putting it on a horse.

228
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,988
The women, of course,
you'd have to choose very carefully...

229
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,421
as carefully as the bouncers.

230
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,189
You need a kind of balance
between the erotic...

231
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,390
and the tragic.

232
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:54,136
Very important to choose
just the right women.

233
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,243
Excuse me, but I must be going.

234
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,906
My driver will be waiting for me.

235
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,576
Mr. Jackson,
perhaps I can offer you a lift somewhere?

236
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,678
No, thank you, my own man will come
and find me before long.

237
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,781
He always does in the end,
whatever I do to try and lose him.

238
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,521
Then may I thank you
for an unusually enjoyable evening?

239
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,462
Mr. Matsuda, this has been a true pleasure.
Really.

240
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,824
-I hope we meet again.
-I hope so, too.

241
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,801
-Good night.
-Good night.

242
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,933
Excuse me.

243
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,606
I believe I have the honor of greeting
Countess Sofia Alexeyevna Belinskya.

244
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,873
Forgive me.
It's quite possible you won't remember me...

245
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,545
but we were friends.

246
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,314
Well, that's to say,
we sometimes played tenis together...

247
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,049
at the Skopichenkos' house in Petersburg.

248
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,892
Of course, I was small then.

249
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,759
-I'm sure you won't remember me, but--
-No, of course.

250
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,791
How could I forget
Count llya Vladimirovitch Litvanoff?

251
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,067
You always beat me.

252
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,232
I'm truly flattered you should remember.

253
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,807
How nice to see you again.

254
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,213
I'm sorry. I must return to my work.

255
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:52,451
Me, too. It was very good of you
to come over like this.

256
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,617
Well, I just happened to see you.

257
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,995
Please, excuse me.

258
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,048
Thank you very much.

259
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,182
Three.

260
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,853
Here, take my arm. Leave with me.

261
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,955
Miss, if your intention
was to be kind to a blind man...

262
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,861
well, I thank you,
but I can get along just fine.

263
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,399
If you were proposing something
altogether different...

264
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:19,233
well, I have to tell you that kind of thing
doesn't interest me so much just now.

265
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,898
I wasn't proposing anything like that.

266
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,442
But if you leave here alone...

267
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,074
there are two villains over there
who will follow you...

268
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,172
hit you over head with their little...

269
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,751
blackjack and then...

270
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,712
steal your wallet
and perhaps your shoes, too.

271
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,284
You shouldn't wear such fine shoes
when you come around here.

272
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,723
You really suppose I'm in danger?

273
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,432
I know it,
but if you leave with me you'll be safe.

274
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,804
They'll think you're my client, and
they don't dare interfere with such things.

275
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,874
Why....

276
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,280
Don't worry. You'll be safe...

277
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,143
from them and from me.

278
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,114
Okay.

279
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,756
I should wear shabbier shoes, you say?

280
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,961
Much shabbier,
and try and look like you have friends...

281
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,930
dangerous friends.

282
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:32,409
Well, thanks for your advice.
I'm beholden to you.

283
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,411
You Russian?

284
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,102
Yes.

285
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:41,210
I was listening just now when you were
talking with your friend, and l....

286
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,914
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't be eavesdropping on people.

287
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:47,152
You know, it's just that
since I lost the use of these eyes...

288
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,318
-I can't--
-No, no, it's all right.

289
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:50,987
That's all right.

290
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:54,156
I know that times are hard for you people.

291
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:58,565
You've been thrown out of your country,
and no one willing to take you in.

292
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,735
I just want you to know
that I understand why you--

293
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,376
-We carry on.
-He's found me, always does.

294
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,448
Well, tonight you got me out of trouble.
I thank you for that.

295
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,152
I've always tended
to get a little overconfident.

296
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,951
I need someone to check on me
from time to time.

297
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,016
-You have someone like that?
-I don't know.

298
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,993
I guess one time my wife
used to perform that function.

299
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:29,462
Nowadays I just have my man Liu over there.

300
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,764
He's a clever fellow,
but I guess it's not his busniess...

301
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,169
to stop me maknig a fool of myself.

302
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,834
Tonight, though, you helped me out.

303
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,639
-Thank you.
-A pleasure.

304
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,780
-Good night.
-Good night.

305
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,228
-You said you'd be out here at 11:30.
-Who cares what I said?

306
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,095
-Now it's 12:17.
-What are you? A railway service?

307
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,469
-You said 11:30.
-Do you see her?

308
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,026
You see her? The one I was talking to?

309
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,095
The Countess?
The one I was talking with just now?

310
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,471
-She's still there.
-She's still there?

311
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,242
She's the one.

312
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,144
Liu Chi, she's the one,
the one I've been looking for.

313
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,811
Yes, yes.

314
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,213
Child, come back here. Do you hear me?

315
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,619
Mama.

316
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,181
-Katiushka.
-Child, come back here, please.

317
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,517
Come here, child.

318
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,585
Mama, can I please come with you
to the market?

319
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:49,032
Yes, of course you can, my darling, but keep
your voice down, Uncle Peter's sleeping.

320
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,864
He's not sleeping. He's just pretending.

321
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,971
-When are we going?
-I have to sleep first. I'm very tired.

322
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,577
Mama, I want to go and see the boats
before they're all gone.

323
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,839
All right, but I need to sleep first.

324
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,744
Katya, come here, please.

325
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,854
I told you to stay here. Did you hear me?

326
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,549
Your bed is free.

327
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,240
It was a good night's work.

328
00:28:56,434 --> 00:29:00,165
Dear Sofia Alexeyevna, you sleep on this.

329
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,132
So soft.

330
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:43,072
But you promised me. You promised me.

331
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,309
And I kept my promise.
I kept the dress for you.

332
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,975
Many people wanted it. Do you understand?

333
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,678
I kept it for you. Now you pay $5.

334
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,812
But you promised me I could have it for $3.

335
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,789
-I didn't promise you that, madam.
-I need it for my work.

336
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:53,949
Many people want this dress.

337
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,516
I have to come here every single day.

338
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,994
-I come in the morning at 4:30.
-And this is why I need this.

339
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:02,032
-And I go back at night, at 11:30 at night.
-And you told me yesterday....

340
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,534
I have to work very hard to feed my children.

341
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:08,599
You have the dress. It is beautiful.
It is very, very nice color.

342
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,004
-Are you going on the boat?
-Sure.

343
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,316
-Where will you go?
-Up to Soochow.

344
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,253
-You should go.
-We're going soon.

345
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:26,954
So long.

346
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,825
May I look?

347
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,555
Go ahead.

348
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,115
Katya.

349
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,119
Come, darlng. It's time to go.

350
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,198
Mama, you got the dress!

351
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,926
I got it.

352
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,286
Here you go.

353
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,500
You know which one's going win?

354
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,831
Most defnintely. I'm betting....

355
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,961
I thnik you're right.

356
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,741
You know, sir,
I was thinking of having a little flutter.

357
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,147
Good, good.

358
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,311
I'm glad to see a little recklessness
entering your spirit, Thomas.

359
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,685
this city is starting to work on you at last.

360
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,314
I'm glad to see you so cheerful.

361
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:43,087
As a matter of fact,
I was getting kind of anxnous...

362
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,527
because, you see, I've come here to....

363
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,524
I've come here to have a little flutter myself.

364
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,193
Are you thinking of placing a large bet?

365
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,204
Substantial enough. Thank you, Jimmy.

366
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,869
You know, Thomas,
there comes a day when you say there are...

367
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,103
some things that you want to do in life...

368
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,476
and you'll never do them
unless you take a risk.

369
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:06,916
Hold everything that you have in your hand
and just take a risk.

370
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,518
sir, are you intending to place
a very large bet?

371
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,283
There are some in this city
who would not consider it large...

372
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,851
but it's just about everything that I have.

373
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,023
But I think that--

374
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,500
No, we're not in Vermont, Thomas.
Don't cluck around me like an old hen.

375
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,197
Mr. Jackson? Mr. Jackson?

376
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:30,573
I'm Fu Chuan Fang. We met in Naiking.

377
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,035
A League of Nations conference.

378
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,142
I was sorry to hear about your misfortune.

379
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,738
Thank you.
this is my friend, Thomas Crane.

380
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,384
How do you do, Mr. Crane?

381
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:46,048
Gentlemen, may I introduce
General Shen Yinchu...

382
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,152
and General Ji Deng?

383
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,251
Ni men hao, gentlemen?

384
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:55,425
Although it's many years too late, let me
thank you from the bottom of my heart

385
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,937
for your dedication in finding
a just solution to our nation's problems.

386
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,839
Mr. Jackson has been a true friend

387
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,501
to all Chinese people.

388
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:11,010
A just solution to your nation's problems.

389
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,945
And where has it got us?

390
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,485
All that clever meddling
we diplomats got up to back then...

391
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,952
and now your nation in chaos...

392
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,957
and Japanese occupying the north...

393
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,420
and your people in civil war.

394
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,964
Excuse me, gentlemen.

395
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,059
I must go and place a bet.

396
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,840
Mr. Jackson.

397
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,101
Good afternoon, Mr. Jackson.

398
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,807
-Mr.... Mr....
-Matsuda.

399
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,077
Exactly. Good to see you again, sir.

400
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,382
And I'm particularly pleased
to run into you, Mr. Jackson.

401
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,982
Because I am leaving Shanghai tomorrow.

402
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,616
this gives me a chance to say goodbye.

403
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,887
Even though our acquaitance was brief...

404
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,361
I very much enjoyed our discussion
the other night.

405
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,454
So did l.

406
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,298
-Well, it's a pity you're leaving.
-I hope to be back in a year or so.

407
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,429
Perhaps we will have a chance
to continue our research then.

408
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:19,204
In fact, Mr. Matsuda, I had hope that
if you return to Shanghai in a year's time...

409
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:23,043
we can go one better
than just continuing our research.

410
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,414
Today, you see, I've had a little luck and....

411
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,681
My God!

412
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:38,093
-I've had a great deal of luck.
-I see, Mr. Jackson.

413
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,528
Mr. Matsuda,
I don't mind telling you right now...

414
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,192
that I feel more than a little frightened.

415
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,258
Let me say this to you today...

416
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,737
that if you return to Shanghan
one year from now...

417
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:53,232
you will be a most welcome guest
in my own establishment.

418
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,211
The bar of your dreams.

419
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,479
So I may have the pleasure, after all.

420
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,219
The bar of my dreams.

421
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,307
You're a very nice man,
but you know the rules.

422
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:39,974
You're breaking my heart.

423
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,212
Please, you need to get a ticket.

424
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,119
Next time you come.
Next time come and ask for me.

425
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,914
-Oh, hello.
-Excuse me.

426
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,288
You remember me?

427
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,658
You looked out for me the other night,
and I very much appreciated nt.

428
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:55,495
You're most welcome.
I see you took advice about shoes.

429
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,932
Shoes? Oh, no, I hadn't intended to.

430
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,961
I just think thnigs have got a little
worse for wear without my noticing.

431
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,674
So shall we dance?

432
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:13,281
Well, frankly, I was wondering
nf you might just sit and talk...

433
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,279
-for as long as the dance.
-Oh, certainly.

434
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,085
Shall we go here?

435
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,853
Excuse me one moment here.

436
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,428
I....

437
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,767
-ls this okay for you?
-this is good, nice here.

438
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,771
Good. Well, look...

439
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,876
I have a proposal to make.

440
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,153
Oh. I see.

441
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:57,986
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that kind of proposal. No.

442
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,663
It's just that, well...

443
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,462
I'm intending to open an establishment.

444
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,595
It's something that I've been planing
for some time...

445
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,871
and it wouldn't work without you.

446
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,468
It wouldn't work without me?
Whatever do you mean?

447
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,142
The place that I'm gonig to open...

448
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:21,446
it'll be a bar, you know,
a little dancing and a little music and....

449
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,755
But it won't be like this.
It'll be nothing like this.

450
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,319
My place will be
just the way that I've seen it...

451
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,363
up here, inside...

452
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,862
and I need you to be my centerpiece.

453
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,640
And I would do what for you, exactly?

454
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:48,877
Just be there and, I think,
dance with a few customers...

455
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:54,348
and talk with them and host them.
That's strictly all that I'd ask.

456
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,247
I'll see that you're well remunerated for it...

457
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:02,452
and you wouldn't have to earn money
in any other way.

458
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,296
You realize, don't you...

459
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,699
I'm not the only Russian Countess
in Shanghai reduced to this sort of lnfe.

460
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,463
I know that, I know.

461
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,837
But it's you.

462
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,099
You're perfect.

463
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,945
And you're what I need.

464
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:26,774
I'm perfect?

465
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,710
But how can you know what I'm like?

466
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,479
Well, we met the other night.

467
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,391
You take it from me,
I know what I'm looknig for.

468
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,299
-will you consider nt?
-Consider it?

469
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:54,601
I'd accept happily
nf I'm really so perfect for you...

470
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,710
but you can't even see me.

471
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:02,775
You should at least
try to feel what I look like.

472
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,321
Blind people do that, don't they?

473
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:14,024
No, no, no, no.
There's no need. There's no need.

474
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,065
I know exactly what you're like.

475
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,596
You...

476
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,302
the bar...

477
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:23,697
everything.

478
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,241
It's all up here...

479
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:27,407
inside.

480
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:34,578
But instead,
maybe we could have that dance.

481
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,013
You can dance all right?

482
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:39,749
Well, to be frank,
I've not tried it since I've lost my sight.

483
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,917
But I think that with you helping me,
I'll be all right.

484
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,457
So let's dance.

485
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,947
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

486
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,026
-Sorry.
-What are you doing?

487
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,623
-Excuse me?
-Dance with a blind man?

488
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,692
You try and stop us.

489
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,205
Blind men have very good ears.

490
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,038
You can't dance here.

491
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,272
Even if you speak Chinese.

492
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,773
You will disturb the other guests.

493
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:41,346
If you have any objections, kindly go to hell.

494
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,180
You tell him.

495
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,856
-Okay, let's find these people in here.
-I don't need to worry about him anymore.

496
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,826
Thibaut de Passavant,
he's here in Shanghai.

497
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,523
Sister Anastasia told me yesterday
after church.

498
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:30,965
Thibaut de Passavant?
What a charming man.

499
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,133
Beautiful man.

500
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,899
-You certain he's here in Shanghai?
-Snster Anastasna was qunte sure.

501
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:40,933
He arrived at least four months ago.
He's posted to the French Consulate.

502
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,080
I wnsh we could see him,
but he can't come here.

503
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:48,312
Olga, dear, I've been thinking about this.
Things are so different.

504
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,785
Perhaps we should pay a call on Thibaut.

505
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,586
No, dear. No, no. I don't think so, no.

506
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,389
It would be for him to call on us.
That's the correct way.

507
00:44:58,462 --> 00:44:59,827
Yes, yes, of course...

508
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:02,764
but it is all so different these days.

509
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:07,065
-So perhaps we could call on him instead.
-No, dear, no. That's not correct.

510
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:10,504
We can't call on him first,
and he can never call on us here.

511
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,804
-Peter, dear, what is your opinion?
-Dear, no. We can't see him.

512
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,368
That's an end to nt.

513
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,878
Please don't distress yourself, Aunt Vera.

514
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:24,216
Once we get to Hong Kong,
our friends will visit us again...

515
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:28,918
you'll give recitals, there'll be card parties,
everything as it used to be.

516
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,491
What's the matter?

517
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,823
The Oblomovs.

518
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,735
When they were here,
they were having to live just like us.

519
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,034
Now look at them,
living the life they used to live.

520
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,938
How do you know that?

521
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,536
They wrote to us.

522
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,572
Ania nicoleyava wrote to us.

523
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,878
You read her letter.

524
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,613
Do you want me to read it to you again?

525
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,453
Mama, where's Ania's letter?
Where did you put it?

526
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:11,093
She took the trouble to write to us
just to tell a pack of lies.

527
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,335
Don't you worry, Aunt Vera.

528
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:25,438
Once we get to Hong Kong,
thnigs will be the way they should be.

529
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,609
What a relief that will be.

530
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:31,414
To be rid of the shame
that's been brought on our family.

531
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:35,424
It's a mercy my son didn't live to see this.

532
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,025
Are you all right?

533
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,900
Yes, I'm fine. I just need a little air.

534
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:49,768
Is Katya all right?

535
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,141
She's enjoying herself.

536
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:55,704
Here.

537
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,442
sit down.

538
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,075
Relax.

539
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:05,084
Please excuse me.
I have to finish these jackets by 5:00.

540
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,713
Yes, of course.

541
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,633
right, it's open.

542
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,404
Mr. Matsuda.

543
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,463
The bartender.

544
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:27,799
I first came across him last summer
in a place off the Avenue Joffre.

545
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,335
And as for the strongarm boys,
the bouncers...

546
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,275
well, I spent a long time hand-picking them.

547
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,574
Different boys that I had seen
ni different places.

548
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:41,016
I'd always kept them in mind,
the ones that I knew I'd one day want to use.

549
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,848
I think that outright violence...

550
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,481
will destroy a perfectly blended mood
in seconds.

551
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:50,652
But a vague and ever-present
possibility of violence...

552
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:53,525
that's something else,
and that can be effective.

553
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,622
Wth a good strongarm team
you could do it.

554
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,189
I was always convinced of that.

555
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:01,135
You brng in the rougher elements,
but then you keep them under control.

556
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:05,573
The other important ingredient is,
well, what do you call it?

557
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,138
Sexuality?

558
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:11,408
The vague promise
of an intimate encounter?

559
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,444
You have to judge it finely, though.

560
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,887
You have to choose women with real care.

561
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,168
So that lady...

562
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,038
she's a Russian?

563
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:46,708
Perhaps an aristocratic lady
who chose to give up her homeland?

564
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:47,841
Chose?

565
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:48,942
No.

566
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:52,147
-That is why you named this establishment.
-Yeah, you got it.

567
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:56,886
She is the Countess Sofia
Alexeyevna Belinskya.

568
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,092
She has everything that I wanted
for this place.

569
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:05,100
She has the allure,
the tragedy, the weariness.

570
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:10,366
She knows that history has no place...

571
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,465
for her kind anymore.

572
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,736
She's perfect.

573
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,639
My centerpiece.

574
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,743
You must be a happy man, Mr. Jackson.

575
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:26,820
In a little over a year,
you've managed to realize your dream.

576
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,955
I thought for a while that I had...

577
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,893
that I had really achieved
what I'd always wanted...

578
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,123
but I was never quite happy.

579
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,955
For a long time,
I couldn't put my finger on it.

580
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,902
I just knew, I just knew that something....
There was something missing.

581
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:44,429
And just a few days ago,
I realized what it was.

582
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,537
There's no political tension in here.

583
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,843
You are saying
that without this political dimension...

584
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:01,220
-your establnishment--
-No, it'll never be more than a confection.

585
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,623
Just a pretty confection, you know.

586
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,126
A few Chinese Reds.

587
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:09,154
Some of their Nationalnst enemies
and maybe a few of your countrymen.

588
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,790
Maybe some of mine.

589
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,597
I can see it. I can see it all in here.

590
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,671
But right now, I just can't see a way forward.

591
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,268
How do you get such people in here
all at the same time?

592
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:25,638
I mean, a fellow can't just take a gun
and force them to come in.

593
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,540
Mr. Jackson, please be careful.

594
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,469
-No, no, no. Stop.
-All right.

595
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,775
How often do I have to tell you
I can get around fine?

596
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,509
Yes, but not this morning.
The men have moved everything.

597
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,710
-It's all different.
-Good, well, you've warned me.

598
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:38,253
Now sit down and carry on playing.

599
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,654
I just need something to sit on.

600
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,691
Watch out.

601
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:57,896
That woke me.

602
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:01,568
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were still here.

603
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,375
Why are you sleeping here again anyway?

604
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,414
You have a nice house to go to.

605
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,248
And you slept in your clothes again.

606
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,414
And what about you?
Why aren't you at home in your bed?

607
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:17,483
There's no bed for me till morning,
and my daughter....

608
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:24,560
Sorry, I was forgetting our agreement.

609
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,593
I've told you, there's no agreement.

610
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:29,935
I just sand once
I thought that we'd get on best...

611
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:33,339
if we confined our friendship
to within these walls.

612
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:36,906
And I'd say
that's worked out pretty well so far.

613
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,505
And for you to hear about my life
beyond this place...

614
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,313
I suppose it spoils your picture of me...

615
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,344
that perfect one you have inside your head.

616
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,021
I don't know what's gotten into you
this morning.

617
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:52,050
Playing the piano first thing,
and now all this talk.

618
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:53,925
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were upstairs.

619
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,898
Forget it.
Anyway, it's a nice way to be woken up.

620
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,060
What you were playing, it sounded pretty.

621
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:02,798
You know, I've known you a whole year,
and I had no idea you played so well.

622
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:05,932
My Aunt Vera taught me.

623
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,302
She was wonderful pianist.

624
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,780
I've forgotten so much.

625
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:17,281
Our friends used to send their children
to her for lessons.

626
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:22,382
I don't even know
if she could still play now.

627
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:27,257
She hasn't touched a piano for years.

628
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,367
I'm sorry. I should go.

629
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,471
My bed will be ready now,
and I need to sleep.

630
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,830
Well, then, till tonight.

631
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,903
I've known you for a whole year, and I still
don't know how you lost your sight.

632
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,683
I had an accident several years ago.

633
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:52,313
But as you see, I don't let it
inconvenience me too much.

634
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,589
What sort of accident?

635
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,586
Well, now that would be going against
our agreement.

636
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:13,268
Why do you have such heavy doors?
You think they'll keep out the world?

637
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,368
Well, that's my intention.

638
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,611
I'll see you tonight.

639
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,507
It's my intention.

640
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,964
Let me out!

641
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,297
Where's my family?

642
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,304
My family is in there.

643
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,615
Three years already.

644
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:34,150
In some ways it seems much longer.

645
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,523
Daddy, can I ask you something?

646
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:41,661
A promise?

647
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,446
As for the....

648
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,290
...give you the privilege
of taking t away, sir.

649
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:12,919
Lovely scarf...

650
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,258
Iovely coat...

651
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,495
120 pounds.

652
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:20,765
It's a lovely price.

653
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,896
Are you sure it would sell?

654
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:25,202
Tell me about your English teacher.

655
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,540
He was from England.
He was not as strict as Mrs. Henderson.

656
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,045
And you should work more on your reading.

657
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,604
Mary, what do you think?

658
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,206
And then she wouldn't be so cross with you.

659
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,151
I'd be locked up
if I told you what I was thinking.

660
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,620
Hello?

661
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:47,329
Hello? How do you do?

662
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,225
Katya.

663
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,224
Come on, Katya.

664
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,193
Katya, come on.

665
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:58,803
-That was him, wasn't it?
-Come on, Katya, we'll be late.

666
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,365
The blind man.

667
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,435
-That was our blind man, wasn't it?
-Yes.

668
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,237
Come on, Katya.

669
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,408
Why didn't he speak to us?

670
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,281
He just didn't.

671
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:14,015
You said he was a nice man.

672
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,152
He is a nice man.

673
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:19,225
Then why didn't he speak to us?

674
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:22,395
Come on, Katya. Mrs. Henderson's waiting.

675
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:24,927
Katya!

676
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:26,757
Katya!

677
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,392
Katya!

678
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:32,901
Hello?

679
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:36,605
And he looked at me again and said,
"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. "

680
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,704
He said,
"You don't half look bad, you don't. "

681
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,772
I said, "Who do?"
He said, "You don't. " I said, "I do?"

682
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,977
He said, "Yes, you do, you don't. "

683
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,448
Katya!

684
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,691
Well, young lady. How are you?

685
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,056
Katya.

686
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,759
Mama says you are
sometimes bad-tempered.

687
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:56,523
Why...

688
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:00,294
I suppose she might be right.

689
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:04,340
Is that why you don't speak to us just now?

690
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,999
I guess it wasn't very good-mainered of me.
I'm sorry.

691
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:11,309
Mrs. Henderson is teaching me
to read and write English.

692
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,578
-One day I'll write you a letter.
-Write me a letter?

693
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:18,585
Can't be the only reason
you're learning English, can it?

694
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,021
But I must write you a letter.
It's very important.

695
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,957
Why is it so important
that you wrnte to me, my dear?

696
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,757
Because you must take us on a boat trip.

697
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,262
-Boat trip?
-Up the river.

698
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,231
-To Soochow.
-Katya, that's enough.

699
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,200
A boat trip to Soochow?

700
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,394
will you take us?
Me and Mama and Aunt Vera?

701
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:37,663
Come, we must go.

702
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,538
-Goodbye, blind man.
-I'll see you later.

703
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:44,807
Can I ask you something?

704
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,542
-Sure.
-A promise.

705
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,207
Well, depends what it is.

706
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,348
When I'm grown, and I'm married...

707
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,486
and I have children of my own...

708
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,587
promise you'll stay with us.

709
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,656
Promise you'll live with me forever.

710
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,165
Don't you think your husband
will have something to say about this?

711
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,258
No.

712
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:08,399
Please promise me.

713
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,705
All right.

714
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,842
If that's what you want.

715
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,571
He said, "Which ain't?" I said, "That ain't. "

716
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:19,672
He said, "That ain't?"
I said, "Yes, it is, it ain't. "

717
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,677
I said, "But be careful when you try her,
she's a flyer...

718
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:26,313
"f you buy her, you've a bargain.
You can take the tip from me. "

719
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:28,752
He said, "What makes you say so?"
I said, "Say so, I should say so. "

720
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:36,057
You know, Olga, dear,
I do wonder if we are making a mistake.

721
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,497
About what?

722
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,798
You know about what.

723
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:42,065
Thibaut de Passavant.

724
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:49,576
-After all, he is an ambassador now.
-No, just a consul, dear.

725
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:54,243
Peter, dearest, what is your view?

726
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:57,851
Should we not pay a little visit
to the French Embassy?

727
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,547
It's a consulate.

728
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,984
It's only a consulate, dear.

729
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:10,131
Olga, dear, there are large beans,
and there are small beans.

730
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,098
In my view, a bean is still a bean....

731
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:14,630
Sofia.

732
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,899
will you deal the hand, please, now?

733
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:19,106
I need to speak to you.

734
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:28,813
Last night, while you were out,
I found Katya playing with your rouge.

735
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:31,777
She put some on her face.

736
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,823
So? Children have to play.

737
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,325
Your rouge.

738
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,259
Aren't you horrified?

739
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:44,096
We've talked about this before.
You have to be more strict.

740
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:48,536
In the evening, when you are dressed
like that, you're not to let Katya near you.

741
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:54,209
-But how can I? She's my daughter.
-Don't you see where this is leading?

742
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,503
Do I have to spell it out?

743
01:01:56,946 --> 01:02:00,404
If you love her,
you'll know what I'm saying is right.

744
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,378
What do you say?

745
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:07,221
I suppose you're right.

746
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,554
Then you have to do your part.

747
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:13,089
She's not to come near you
when you're like that.

748
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:23,528
Grusha, I'll do as you say.
You're right, I see it.

749
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:26,370
But you must promise me something.

750
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:31,035
If something happens to me,
will you love her?

751
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:34,844
I mean, treat her gently and kindly
at all times?

752
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,713
You swear to me now you will. Swear it.

753
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,482
Of course I will.

754
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,592
She's my brother's child.
She looks like him. his eyes--

755
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:46,890
Swear you'll love her and be gentle to her.

756
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,029
I swear it.

757
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,164
Thank you.

758
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:00,005
Thank you, Grushenka.

759
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:06,340
Papa!

760
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,449
You're late.

761
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,577
No, my darlings, this isn't so late.

762
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:33,139
Very good. Show it to your mama.

763
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,703
Mama? Mama?

764
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,614
Let me in!

765
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,049
Come here, Katya.

766
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,917
Let me in! I've made you a new painting.

767
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:49,054
-Why have you locked it?
-Katya.

768
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:50,790
Come here.

769
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:52,492
She's busy.

770
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,228
Let me see.

771
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:57,263
It's beautiful. Is it a soldier?

772
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,596
Is this one of our dear Czar's guards?

773
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:03,471
What a funny uniform he's wearing.

774
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:10,008
Come on.

775
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,895
You want me?

776
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:30,926
-No, no.
-Come back.

777
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,744
Well, you're very quiet tonight.

778
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:50,585
I was just wondering if,
when I'm too old to be here like this...

779
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,850
if my daughter will be here instead,
in my place.

780
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,989
I was just thinking, that's all.

781
01:04:57,093 --> 01:05:01,086
-Well, I'm sure that she--
-But you don't want to hear this kind of talk.

782
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:03,290
We have our agreement after all...

783
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,233
and I'm sorry about what happened
at the cafe this afternoon...

784
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:09,863
disturbing you like that
when you're enjoying your radio.

785
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:14,841
You and your daughter,
do you walk that way often?

786
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,138
-Through Frenchtown?
-Yes.

787
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,939
I sit in that cafe a lot.

788
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,879
Not always outside like that but l....

789
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,048
I'm there a lot.

790
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:28,849
Fine.

791
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:10,885
Mr. Jackson?

792
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,281
Please excuse me.

793
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,789
But I was told I might find you here.

794
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:20,090
Mr. Matsuda, won't you join me for coffee?

795
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:23,290
No, thank you. But if you'll excuse me...

796
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,766
I shall impose myself on you
for just a moment.

797
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,565
Please, come and sit down.

798
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:34,776
Mr. Jackson.

799
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:39,181
I've been thinking about your establishment.

800
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,909
What you said that evening
I visited you there.

801
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:45,442
-About it missnig--
-Political tension, you called it.

802
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:49,755
How to bring political tension
to your establishment?

803
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:54,093
The idea struck me at the time
as a little eccentric.

804
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:57,088
But it has ntrigued me ever since.

805
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,694
I believe there is a way.

806
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,837
And what is that, Mr. Matsuda?

807
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:07,102
I'm in touch with a certain person...

808
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:12,280
a Chinese gentleman who exercnses
a degree of influence in Shanghai.

809
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:16,082
It is possible he might be able to assist.

810
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:19,080
How exactly would he do that?

811
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,749
My acquaintance is in a position...

812
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:26,553
to persuade many people
to do what he requests.

813
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,922
You mean that he's a hood?

814
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:31,726
You might say so.

815
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:39,405
And he can persuade the various factions
that I want to come into my place?

816
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:41,599
Snmply an idea.

817
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:45,575
Why would he want to help me?

818
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,473
Why? Because....

819
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:53,511
Because l, in turn,
have the means to persuade him.

820
01:09:56,025 --> 01:10:00,621
What kind of work is it that you do,
Mr. Matsuda?

821
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:03,927
Please, I would very much like to help you.

822
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:08,798
Particularly now that I can see
what you might achieve.

823
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,238
It could be something quite wonderful.

824
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:17,245
I would suggest
you introduce first some communists.

825
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:21,248
Not, of course, known members of the Party.
This would be too much.

826
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,841
I can suggest certain people to you.

827
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,114
MagaZine editors, writers...

828
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:29,789
men suspected of communist links.

829
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:34,758
Then, after some time, when
our Red friends are comfortably installed...

830
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:40,368
you could then introduce certain individuals
associated with the Kuomintang.

831
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:45,069
Please give these two camps plenty of time
to get used to each other.

832
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:49,003
And only then you might add
some Chinese soldiers...

833
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,713
a few Japanese merchant sailors...

834
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:54,677
perhaps one or two Japanese businessmen.

835
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,718
But please be cautious.

836
01:10:56,785 --> 01:11:00,516
This will be
a most difficult balance to achieve.
