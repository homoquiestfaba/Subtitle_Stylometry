1
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:18,152
[intense mysterious music]

2
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,598
[tense music]

3
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,500
I will talk to you of art,

4
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,802
for there's nothing else
to talk about,

5
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,471
for there is nothing else.

6
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,075
Life is nothing
but a homeless traveler

7
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,043
on the RTD of art.

8
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,746
Burn gas on the freeways

9
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:48,582
and whip your sour cream
of circumstance,

10
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,151
flip at your channels

11
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:52,186
and plod at your monitors.

12
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,424
Creation is, all else is not.

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,562
What is not creation is
meatless sausage and rice cakes.

14
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,765
Let it all crumble
to feed the artist.

15
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,000
The artist is,

16
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,203
all others are not.

17
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,906
A canvas is
a canvas or a painting.

18
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,309
A rock is a rock or a statue.

19
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,112
A sound is a sound
or it is music.

20
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:22,082
A preacher is a preacher
or an artist.

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,585
Where are John, Joe,
Jake, Jim, Jerk,

22
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,687
dead, dead, dead.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,123
They were not born
before they were born.

24
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,192
They were not born.

25
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:36,430
Where are Leonardo, Mozart,
Shakespeare,

26
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,733
alive, alive, alive.

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,969
They were born.

28
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:47,241
Bring on the multitudes
and the multitude of fishes.

29
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,244
Feed them
that you will be satisfied.

30
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,813
Nourish the artist,

31
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:55,616
stretch their skin
upon an easel,

32
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,751
crush their bones into a paste

33
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,487
that he may mold them.

34
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,589
Let them die.

35
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,192
And in their miserable death

36
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,394
become the clay in his hands

37
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:11,098
that he might form
an ashtray or an ark,

38
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:14,101
that he might take you
in his magic hands

39
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:18,172
and wring from
your marrow wonder,

40
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:23,644
all that is comes through
the eye of the artist.

41
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,179
[fingers snapping]

42
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,382
All the rest are blind fish,

43
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,485
swimming in the cave
of aloneness.

44
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,122
Swim on, you mortals
and muddling maddened souls,

45
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:39,993
and dream of that one bright
and sunny island.

46
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,364
Some artists will bait a hook

47
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:47,468
and let you bite upon it,
bite hard, and die.

48
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:54,542
And in his stomach,
you will feed creation!

49
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,412
[audience applauding]

50
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,081
[jazzy music]

51
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:06,687
Bravo, Maxwell, bravo!

52
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:11,825
Hi, Walter.

53
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,062
[man] Walter,
what are you doing?

54
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,699
Oh, uh, I was actually just
looking at Carla's picture.

55
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,201
Well, that's not what
I pay you for, now is it?

56
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,637
No, Mr. DeSantos,
I'm sorry, Mr. De--

57
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,973
Don't be sorry.
Be a bus boy.

58
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,542
A busy bee busboy.

59
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,710
Yes sir.

60
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,883
- Hi, Carla.
- [Carla] Hello, Leonard.

61
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,819
Ah, your new headshots.
- Si.

62
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,054
Oh, very nice.

63
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,190
Very, very nice.

64
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:47,027
Leonard, why do you have to
be so mean to him?

65
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:51,699
Excuse me, sir.

66
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,904
[music continues]

67
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,673
Nice talking to you.
I got to go.

68
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:05,078
[people chatting]

69
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,014
[people shushing]

70
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,383
Who can make the monkey laugh?

71
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,885
- [mechanical chattering]
- I can.

72
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,054
- [mechanical chattering]
- I can.

73
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,757
Who can make the monkey laugh?

74
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,126
- [mechanical chattering]
- I can.

75
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,629
- [mechanical chattering]
- I can.

76
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,764
Who am I?

77
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:29,236
Mm. You don't know me
but I know you.

78
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,805
I've been looking after you.

79
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:36,243
You, when you weren't chosen
for the little league team,

80
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,279
you, little baby, went home
and cried.

81
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,682
[whiny crying]

82
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,984
You should have called on me.

83
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:48,121
I was there waiting,
watching after you.

84
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,290
Who am I?

85
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,728
I'm your patron saint of anger.

86
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:01,435
A-N-G-E-R. R-A-G-E. R-A-G-E-N.

87
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,270
Raging in anger.

88
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:04,938
Rage in anger.

89
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,574
[door creaks]

90
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:08,542
How ya doin'?

91
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,243
[man] All right man,
how you doin'?

92
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,245
[poet continues indistinctly]

93
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,051
[smacks lips]

94
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:21,955
[man] Later.

95
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,223
What do you got?

96
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:24,425
Nothing yet.

97
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,528
There's definitely
a lot of drugs around here.

98
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,296
I've been keeping a low profile

99
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,965
but I just can't figure out
who's dealing,

100
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,601
at least not yet anyway.

101
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,604
[mechanical chattering]

102
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,706
Who can make the monkey laugh?

103
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,041
- [mechanical chattering]
- I can, I can.

104
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,878
I am your patron saint of anger.

105
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:49,683
[audience applauding]

106
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,991
Brava, brava, brava!

107
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,128
Ergo, what do you think
of these, huh?

108
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,796
Tell me what you think.

109
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,534
Perfectly adequate,

110
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:10,871
much like the performance
of St. Anger over there.

111
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,007
I don't think anyone could
comprehend what I was saying.

112
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:19,346
Their blank faces staring,
mute, unfeeling.

113
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,149
Oh, I liked it very much,
Mr. Brook.

114
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,518
I liked it very much.

115
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,121
Well, I'm overjoyed.

116
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,559
"Let them die.

117
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,995
And by their miserable death,
become the clay

118
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:40,968
in his hands that he might form
an ashtray or an ark."

119
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,036
Yeah, that's a word for word.

120
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,006
Is it? I've forgotten.

121
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:49,877
Man, you mean you don't even
remember your own poems?

122
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,379
That's so Goethe.

123
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,882
I refuse to say
the same thing twice.

124
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,784
Repetition is death.

125
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,185
[man] What do you mean?

126
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:59,720
Teach me.

127
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,522
When you repeat something,

128
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,291
you relive a moment, wasting it,

129
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,560
looking at a shed skin.

130
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:11,565
I only want new impressions,
new sensations.

131
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,571
But I thought you said, "Life is
as like a homeless traveler

132
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,107
- on the RTD bus."
- I know that, I know that!

133
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,677
Walter, Leonard,
he is looking at you again.

134
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,952
Man, that guy is such a...

135
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,923
losery type of guy.

136
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,592
[music continues]

137
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,962
We heard that you could pick up

138
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,164
some really cutting edge pieces,

139
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,833
if you know what to look for
around here.

140
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,035
I'm looking for something
for my den,

141
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:52,472
something unusual, something
je ne sais quoi.

142
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,107
Do you know what that means?

143
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,444
Yeah, uh, well perhaps
these might interest you.

144
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,447
These are from
our roadkill series.

145
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,082
I take the pictures.

146
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,216
I do the research.

147
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:08,288
Oh, they're sort of
like Les Crim's.

148
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:09,857
- [artist] Sorta.
- Yeah, exactly.

149
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,459
And as a matter of fact,
we actually do
the driving as well.

150
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,028
Well, I don't know, dear,
what do you think?

151
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,330
- Maybe--
- Oh good Christ, no!

152
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,733
We have friends
that are members of PETA.

153
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,368
[man] Of course, you're right.

154
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,103
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid we're looking

155
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,407
for more of
an investment possibility.

156
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,811
Hey, look, man, this is not
a supermarket, okay?

157
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,680
There are no aisles here,
right?

158
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,048
There's no 10 items or less
express checkout.

159
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,350
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, investment potential,

160
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,352
that's a real dead soul
way of looking at it.

161
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,621
Nonsense!

162
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,490
Why, we've developed
great rapport
with many young artists.

163
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,759
We love artists.
We support artists.

164
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,194
We're very supportive.

165
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,164
[Walter] "All that is comes
through the eye of the artist.

166
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:58,739
The rest are blind fish
swimming in
the cave of aloneness."

167
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,741
Oh, that's very deep.

168
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,343
[Walter] "Feed them
that you will be nourished.

169
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:10,017
The artist is,
all others or not."

170
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,820
Where did I just hear that
someplace?

171
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,254
Are you a poet, too?

172
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,856
[both laughing]

173
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:19,226
[chuckles] Ah, no.

174
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,194
Well, what do you do?

175
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,397
[stammers]

176
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,634
I've been working,

177
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,368
I've been working
on something, but I'm...

178
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,606
um, I'm just not finished yet,
yeah.

179
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,208
Oh, and what is it?
A crying clown?

180
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,376
[laughs]

181
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,278
Look, man, why don't you
get out of here, okay?

182
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,080
We are trying to
negotiate a deal.

183
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:42,082
I am working on something.

184
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:43,617
[Leonard] Walter.

185
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,755
You're startin' to
piss me off.

186
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,122
Come on,
let's get back to work.

187
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,592
Sorry about that folks.

188
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,929
Is he, um, retarded?

189
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,966
No, he's just a bus boy.

190
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,135
[all laughing]

191
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,337
Get your feet off the chair.

192
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,274
See, I spelled the word feel

193
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,610
with an extra E
to emphasize exactly

194
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:11,879
- how much--
- [Walter] Excuse me,

195
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,613
is Carla done with her coffee?

196
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,050
I don't know, Walter,
take a risk.

197
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,487
And also
I spelled the word closet

198
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,723
with a K, but that's for
something different.

199
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:27,160
Uh, you know,
to paraphrase Moliere,
takes one to know one.

200
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,763
[laughs] You know,
if you've seen Tartu.

[gate squeaking]

203
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,170
Hello, Walter.

204
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,240
Hello, Mrs. Swicker.

205
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,641
I wanted to tell you,

206
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,611
the super fixed
those leaking pipes

207
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,579
and sealed up
that hole in the wall.

208
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,018
Oh, okay.

209
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,255
Walter, you look awfully pale,

210
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,990
what'd you have to eat today?

211
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,026
I had a salami sandwich,
Mrs.--

212
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,162
Oh Walter,
if you were my son--
Walter, Walter,

213
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,632
why don't you let me fix you
a nice hot bowl of soup.

214
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,200
It won't take but a minute.

215
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,038
That's okay, Mrs. Swicker.
I--I can fix myself something.

216
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,207
I...I have something important
to do.

217
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,345
Oh, by the way, Walter,

218
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,882
did you happen to see Frankie
out here by any chance?

219
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,650
No, I didn't see him at all.

220
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:27,821
Oh, what's got into that cat?

221
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,424
[stammers] Well,
if you do see him,

222
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,962
would you tell him
that I have a nice fat piece

223
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,664
of ocean-fresh halibut
for him?

224
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,499
Okay, Mrs. Swicker.

225
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,401
Good night, Walter.

226
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,971
Good night, Mrs. Swicker.

227
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,106

Oh, Carla.

235
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,268
Now I have my muse.

[cat mewing]

237
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,878
Frankie?

a style of my own.

What do you think, huh?

282
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,893
You like them?

283
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,029
Oh yes.

284
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,099
Very, very nice.

Hello.

What are you doing here
so early?

[Walter] Well,

289
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,216
I brought something.

290
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,584
What is it, your laundry?

291
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,054
Don't worry about him.
What have you got?

293

Wow.

00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,506
Leonard, look at this.

[Leonard]
Where'd you buy that?

297
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,709
I didn't buy it.

298
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:51,378
I made it.

299
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,346
You made that?

00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,248
[hissing]

00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,749
- Yeah.
- [Carla] I've never seen

anything like it.

303
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:01,188
Maybe Segal, but nothing
with such a dichotomy.

304
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,522
It's very good, Walter.

- Honest?
- [mysterious music]

Uh..."Dead Cat."

308
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,033
Well, it certainly
looks dead enough.

309
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,002
You wanna buy it
and put it in the club?

310
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,005
[laughs nervously]
It'll scare people away.

311
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,074
Don't you feel it?

312
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,409
[both] Feel what?

313
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,545
Way it's giving off
it's presence.

314
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,616
[speaking Italian]
Come, take a closer look.

315
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,587
Look at the detail.

316
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,924
It's so alive
and yet it's so dead.

317
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,726
Look at the expression
on his face.

318
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:42,829
Why'd you put a knife in it?

319
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,400
- I didn't mean to.
- Ah.

320
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:48,968
Got carried away, huh?

321
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,504
All right, I'll tell you what.

322
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,774
I'll put it in the corner
of the alcove, uh...

323
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,277
if it sells,
we'll split it 50-50.

324
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:58,511
- How's that?
- Bene.

325
00:17:58,645 --> 00:17:59,646
Sure.

326
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,117
Wow.

327
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,920
I guess I am an artist
after all.

328
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,222
Maybe so.

329
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,057
Yeah, I wouldn't quit
your day job.

330
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:16,463
"All that is comes through
the eye of the artist."

331

Yeah, don't lose your ear,
Van Gogh.

332
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,567
Why don't you
start with the toilets?

333

[woman]
You won't take me seriously.

334
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,105
I'm just a stupid girl.

Yeah, it's like out there.

341

Wanna buy it?

No, no man, I...

345
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,681
I don't have the funds

346
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,251
to be buying
various pieces of artwork.

347
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,453
You understand
what I'm saying?

348
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,154
[Walter] Sure.

349
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:18,057
- Good luck, though.
- Yeah.

350

Hey Walter, hey man, congrats.

358
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,712
Your cat is fat.

359
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,181
Yes,
everybody's talking about it.

00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,355
[jazzy music]

362
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:59,459
As you pass through
the portals of
this elegant chamber,

363
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,094
I'm sure you noticed
on the right,

364
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,096
a small plaster figure

365
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:08,401
and assumed this transfixed
effigy to be the work

366
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,002
of a master sculptor.

367
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,439
Indeed, it is.

368
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,709
And that bright new creator
is in our midst.

369
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,446
He's none other than
Walter Paisley,

370
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,080
our very own busboy.

371
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,281
[man whispering]
Which one's Walter?

372
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,984
[Maxwell] Who's undiscovered
hands of genius

373
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,288
have been carrying away
your empty cups
of frustration.

374
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,991
Remember his name,

375
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,193
Walter.

376
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,430
[ice clinks]

377
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,266
- [speaking Italian]
- [audience applauding]

378
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:45,204
Bring me a gimlet.

379
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,275
Oh, hey, Walter.

380
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,777
Congrats on the cat, man.

381
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,613
We're just wondering, uh,
where you got the idea

382
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,881
for dead animals.

383
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:58,184
Yeah, Walter,
can you say plagiarism?

384
00:21:58,685 --> 00:21:59,919
Don't listen to them, Walter.

385
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,253
I get it.

386
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,356
I get it.

387
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:04,857
You get what?

388
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,059
Your work,
the layers of irony.

389
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,728
- [man] There's Walter.
- Paisley, congratulations.

390
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,498
That is just the most amazing,
amazing work.

391
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,766
[crowd chattering]

392
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,868
I can get you representation
with one phone call.

393
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,804
If you need studio space,
call me.

394
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,206
I understand it, man,
I hate stinkin' cats.

395
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:22,675
[detective]
What the hell is going on?

396
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,178
Everybody wants to meet
the bus boy.

397
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,747
[man] You know what this means
for your career?

398
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:29,816
I'm outta here.

399
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,387
See ya. [exhales]

400
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:37,189
What's going on over there?

401
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:39,692
[sighs] I don't know.

402
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,496
And where our
double latte macchiatos?

403
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,500
Service around here
has really gone to hell.

404
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:49,736
You!

405
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,804
We ordered 20 minutes ago.

406
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:53,272
20 minutes ago.

407
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:55,508
Terribly sorry,
I'll be right with you

408
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:58,411
and I'll make him triple it,
no extra charge.

409
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,013
I found five dollars so
I can buy your cat.

410
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,915
I have a gallery on Melrose
with free parking.

411
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,517
I always knew it would happen,
Walter.

412
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,052
What's next, "Dead Dog"?

413
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,187
- [crowd chattering]
- [music continues]

414
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,764
[man] They all say that
Generation X is cliché,

415
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,398
but I have never thought
that in my life.

416
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,067
Actually, who does your hair?
Is it Doyle Wilson?

417
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,536
All right, folks, show's over.

418
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:26,338
Come on, drink your latte,
eat your muffins.

419
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:30,376
Do you think
I look like a beatnik?

420
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,881
Darling, you reek of Bohemia.

421
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,850
[music continues]

422
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:40,286
Did you hear that,
Mr. DeSantos?

423
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,089
People seem to
really like "Dead Cat."

424
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,357
Yes, yeah, they do.
Don't they, Walter?

425
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,594
Look, why don't you
take the rest of
the night off, okay?

426
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,795
You look tired.

427
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,130
Well, I'm not tired.

428
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:53,933
No, look, it's okay.

429
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:55,835
You know, you came in early

430
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,537
and besides you're creating
an incident.

431
00:23:57,704 --> 00:24:00,106
When people are applauding,
they don't order anything.

432
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:02,575
I'm sorry.

433
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:06,579
No, look, Walter, okay,
go home. Okay?

434
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:07,947
Work on something.

435
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,415
All right? Make another cat.

436
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,785
Okay.

437
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:14,921
Good night, Walter.

438
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,157
Good night, Mr. DeSantos.

439
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:21,761
Wait, Walter?

440
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,296
Hello, Mayolia.

441
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,433
You really did something
to me tonight with your work.

442
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:29,602
With "Dead Cat"?

443
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:30,937
With "Dead Cat."

444
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,673
[chuckles] It was like
a breath of fresh air.

445
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:36,408
Oh, I could just babble on
about it for hours.

446
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,747
- Really?
- Yeah. I really could.

447
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,615
[sensuous music]

448
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,618
It's like, um,
you've turned on.

449
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:48,487
- Turned on?
- Yeah.

450
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:52,324
A white, hot bulb
is burning inside of you.

451
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,894
Oh, I want to be warmed
by it, Walter.

452
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,964
That's really nice
of you to say, Mayolia.

453
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,366
Oh, let me enter your world,
Walter.

454
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:04,571
Let me enter that white hot,
inspired world of yours.

455
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,040
I can't, I gotta go home.

456
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,243
Well, I'll go home with.

457
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:16,148
No, Mrs. Swicker will
start asking questions and...

458
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,186
Let me give you something then.

459
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,656
maybe this will give you
some inspiration,

460
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:26,659
change your perception
of reality.

461
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,161
I want you to have it.

462
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,697
There's something in here
for you.

463
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:35,301
Gee, thank you.

464
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,036
Let it inspire you Walter.

465
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:39,205
Maybe it will let you
think of me.

466
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,212
[dog barking]

467
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,481
[tense music]

468
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:54,654
[locket clicks open]

469
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,789
[mysterious music]

470
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:03,896
[tense music]

471
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,565
[dog barking]

472
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,442
[music continues]

473
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,956
[dog continues barking]

474
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,531
Why, yes, I...I do think
"Dead Cat" is a masterpiece.

475
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,268
- [gun clicking]
- [music continues]

476
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,604
What's that, Carla?

477
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,608
Oh.

478
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:50,777
Oh, I love you, too.

479
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,512
[knocking on door]

480
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,283
[door creaking]

481
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:58,685
Hello, Walter.

482
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,619
Hi.

483
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,289
I know you...

484
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,424
from the Jabberjaw, right?

485
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:08,260
Yes, can I come in, Walter?

486
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,831
Sure.

487
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:16,936
[door shutting]

488
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,807
Nice basement you got here.

489
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:22,942
[chuckles]

490
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,077
I was just fixing some pancakes.

491
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,013
You can have some, if you like.

492
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,115
Oh, I don't think so, Walter.

493
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,286
[tense music]

494
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:36,823
Did you see my cat?

495
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,257
Yeah, I saw your cat

496
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,760
and I also saw the girl
give you this.

497
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,264
Oh, that was Mayolia.

498
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,499
She's a nice girl.

499
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,668
She's kind of strange though.

500
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:52,038
[music continues]

501
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,544
You like chasing the dragon,
Walter?

502
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,448
- Chasing the dragon?
- Yeah.

503
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,019
[laughs nervously] What do you--
what do you mean?

504
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,620
Ah, let's cut the crap.

505
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,358
I'm a police officer and
you are in deep shit,

506
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,525
pal, whether you know it or not.

507
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,996
Possession of narcotics
isn't something we take lightly.

508
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,164
You understand.

509
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:21,033
But I got a feeling
you are gonna cooperate with me.

510
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,502
You wanna tell me
about your connection?

511
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:28,307
- Connection?
- I'm not trying to pinch you.

512
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,042
I don't care about you
or the girl,

513
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,510
but if you want to
save your ass,

514
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:33,312
you better start telling me
what I want to hear.

515
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:35,782
Telling you what?

516
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:37,383
Who's the head honcho?

517
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,385
Who supplying the smack?

518
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,253
Smack.

519
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,521
God dammit, Walter!

520
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,023
Where ya from, the moon?

521
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:48,627
Haven't you ever heard of smack,
horse, junk, heroin?

522
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:50,629
Oh, I--I have heard of that.

523
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,531
I've never really seen it,
though, I mean...

524
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:54,867
I've heard it's very expensive.

525
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,236
Oh, yeah.

526
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,872
It can be very expensive.

527
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,440
[music continues]

528
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,943
Wow. [sighs]

529
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:07,213
Geez, wasn't that nice
of Mayolia to...

530
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,715
to give me some expensive smack?

531
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,750
Who do you think
you're dealing with?

532
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,020
I'm trying to
cut you a break, kid.

533
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:16,722
- You are?
- Yeah,

534
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:19,291
but you got to drop
this mild-mannered bit

535
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,894
'cause it doesn't fly with me,
Walter.

536
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:23,796
I don't know what
you're talking about.

537
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,435
All right,
you're coming downtown with me.

538
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,839
- What did I do?
- Make it easy on yourself,
dummy.

539
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,240
That was Mayolia.

540
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,209
She gave it me,
I didn't even ask her for it.

541
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:40,579
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard
that song and dance before.

542
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,481
Now just save your breath.

543
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:43,916
You're comin' downtown with me.

544
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,352
I told you
I didn't do nothing wrong.

545
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:47,553
Now don't get me mad, Walter.

546
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,221
We're just going to take
a little drive, all right?

547
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:50,656
I'm not going anywhere with you!

548
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,591
Turn around!

549
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,426
Back up and turn around!

550
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:56,495
Please, put that away, please.
Come on, please,

551
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:57,663
- can you put that--
- What, are you deaf?

552
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,231
- Now turn around.
- Don't shoot me, please.

553
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:00,432
Just relax, Walter.

554
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,134
- Sir, could you please--
- Shut up and relax.

555
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,104
Would you please put that
down? Sir, please?

556
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:06,272
Just relax.

557
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,573
- [whimpers] Please, sir.
- Shut up.

558
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:09,275
- [metal banging]
- [grunts]

559
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:10,742
[body falling]

560
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,744
[Walter panting]

561
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:16,715
- [blood pattering]
- [eerie music]

562
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:30,662
[knocking on door]

563
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:31,898
[Mrs. Swicker] Walter?

564
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:33,866
[knocking on door]

565
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,002
Walter, are you all right?

566
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,270
I thought I heard
someone shouting.

567
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,572
[objects clattering]

568
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,675
- [knocking on door]
- Walter?

569
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:47,146
- Walter?
- [knocking on door]

570
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,916
Walter, I'm coming in!

571
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,651
[door creaking]

572
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,820
What is all the noise in here?

573
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:57,156
Noise, Mrs. Swicker?

574
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,059
- What noise?
- Don't you tell me

575
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:01,994
I didn't hear a racket.

576
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,529
I am an older woman.

577
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,966
I don't need to be upset and
disturbed in this manner.

578
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,936
Yeah, I understand.

579
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,271
I was just
straightening up the place.

580
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,974
Straightening up, indeed!

581
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,945
Are you sure you're alone?

582
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,316
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker.

583
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:27,586
You know that.

584
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:32,291
Walter, have you been
talking to yourself again?

585
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:36,595
Well, I...I guess I have,
Mrs. Swicker.

586
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,065
Somebody's got to.

587
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,434
Oh, Walter.

588
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,106
You know what you need?

589
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:51,443
A girl, and
she doesn't have to be pretty.

590
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,445
Just so she'll take
good care of you.

591
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:57,783
Oh. I take real good care
of myself, Mrs. Swicker.

592
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:00,519
Oh yeah, I can see that.

593
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,822
Look at this place.

594
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,491
[dramatic music]

595
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:06,858
It's terrible.

596
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:08,961
Don't you ever clean it up?

597
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,598
Walter, are you listening to me?

598
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:18,337
Um, Mrs. Swicker, I have to go
meet some friends.

599
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:21,974
So I have to take a shower.

600
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,677
[Mrs. Swicker] Well, why don't
you clean up this dump?

601
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,446
I will, Mrs. Swicker,
I will, goodnight.

602
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:28,947
Walter,
what is the matter with you?

603
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:30,516
I don't know.

604
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:33,085
- [door shutting]
- [deadbolt locking]

605
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:35,887
[exhales loudly]

606
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:37,889
[frantic music]

607
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,760
[heavy breathing]

608
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,364
I didn't mean to hurt you, sir.

609
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:58,110
Just think, if you had shot me,

610
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:00,846
you'd be picking up
my blood now.

611
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,514
[pattering]

612
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,785
[whispering] This is crazy,
this is crazy, this is crazy!

613
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,422
I didn't know
you had it in you, Walter,

614
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,191
I didn't know you had it in you.

615
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,133
Mr. DeSantos said,
"Make something, Walter,

616
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:23,469
make another cat."

617
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:28,507
I don't have another cat.

618
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,776
[blood pattering]

619
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,746
[eerie music]

620
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,853
[man over phone] Good morning,
Third Precinct.

621
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:43,755
Yeah, this is Detective Lane.

622
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,524
Has my partner checked in yet?

623
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,193
[man over phone]
Um, no, not yet, sir.

624
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,360
Damn.

625
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,130
He's probably putting a little
cream in someone's coffee

626
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,699
but let's put an APB out on him
just to be safe.

627
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,068
Oh, and don't send anyone
to the Jabberjaw.

628
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:57,869
It'll blow my cover.

629
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,838
[man over phone] Okay, yeah.
Are you sure sir?

630
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:01,473
Yeah. I'm sure. Bye.

631
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:03,008
[receiver clanging]

632
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,292
[phone ringing]

633
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,074
Jabberjaw for coffee,
art and personal growth.

634
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:38,977
"Dead Cat"?

635
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,147
[bright music]

636
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:44,683
Yes, it's for sale.

637
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:54,059
Well, the artist isn't here
just now, but I am the agent.

638
00:34:57,163 --> 00:35:00,999
Well, we've had quite a few
calls on this piece.

639
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,836
What were you
interested in paying?

640
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:11,243
[chuckles] Well, that may seem
like a fair price to you

641
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:15,547
but, uh, we're talking about
an exciting new artist here.

642
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:24,790
Uh, yeah, that sounds more like
the right ballpark. Uh.

643
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,626
Look, uh, can I get back to you?

644
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:31,197
Uh, the piece needs to be fixed,
uh, mounted.

645
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:33,599
Can you call back later?

646
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,768
Ask for Leonard.

647
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:40,939
- [phone beeps]
- [tense music]

648
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:51,116
Walter, you naughty boy.

649
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:54,820
What do you want?

650
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,226
Well, as long as you're here,
you might as well listen.

651
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,598
I got something to say
about wanting and not getting,

652
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,669
but I don't talk with my mouth.

653
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,872
I hope that's okay.

654
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:19,010
[heavy metal music]

655
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,618
- See that guy's
doing something.
- Hm?

656
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,620
- That's good, what he's doing.
- Yeah.

657
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,722
[Cuff] I mean the fact that
even if you don't get

658
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,224
- what he's trying to say--
- I do get it.

659
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:33,692
Okay. But I'm just saying
if you don't--

660
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,160
- [Link] I totally get it.
- [Cuff] Fine, you get it

661
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,728
just like me,
I'm an artist, right?

662
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:38,297
- I know that, so am I.
- That's what I have to do.

663
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,965
- [Link] Right.
- Okay, that's the whole point,

664
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,199
I have something to say
legitimately,

665
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:43,335
unlike people like Walter,
right?

666
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:44,736
- Oh, right!
- Who just steals

667
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:46,405
other people's ideas
and concepts.

668
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:48,106
He has nothing to say
for himself.

669
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:49,641
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
it's that guy again.

670
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,443
[music continues]

671
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,011
[Cuff]
What's that guy's story?

672
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,513
You know, I see him around here
all the time.

673
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,881
He's always like lurking,
you know?

674
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,048
I think he's a narc
or something.

675
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,216
Yeah, he's pretty cop-like.

676
00:36:58,384 --> 00:36:59,585
[Link] Yeah, yeah,
maybe he is a cop,

677
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:00,919
maybe he's here
looking for Walter

678
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:02,521
'cause he know Walter's a thief.

679
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,390
- [Link] Absolutely.
- [glass clinking]

680
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,725
Geez, take it easy, Walter.

681
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,727
I'm sorry, Mr. DeSantos.

682
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:12,331
That's all right, Walter,
come here.

683
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:14,266
I want to have a little--
little chat.

684
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,034
- [music continues]
- [whimpering]

685
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:17,769
See that?

686
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,438
The clumsiness of guilt, man.

687
00:37:19,605 --> 00:37:21,540
That's how they got Oswald,
he was staggering.

688
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,709
[thudding]

689
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,678
[audience cheering, applauding]

690
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:33,319
Put the tray down, Walter,
and have a seat.

691
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,457
I thought I wasn't supposed to
sit in customers' seats.

692
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,959
Why shouldn't you, Walter,
things are different now.

693
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:43,629
- They are?
- Of course they are.

694
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,368
You've arrived.

695
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,771
You've been recognized.

696
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,139
You're a talent.

697
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,044
Leonard, what are you doing?

698
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,012
- Hi, Carla.
- Hi, Walter.

699
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,948
What am I doing?

700
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:07,453
I'm trying to tell Walter
I want to be his agent.

701
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:11,623
- Really?
- [speaking Italian]

702
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,626
Why the sudden interest
in Walter's work, huh?

703
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,330
Because I have faith in you,
Walter.

704
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:21,700
Now I can't make any promises,

705
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,737
but I think
I can sell "Dead Cat."

706
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,174
Now I'm gonna have to hustle.

707
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:32,644
So I'll expect
to make something off it too.

708
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:36,515
That sounds fair.

709
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,354
Hey, you know what this proves?

710
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,690
What, Mr. DeSantos?

711
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:48,193
It proves I've underestimated
your ability.

712
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:53,799
Walter's work, well,
it has enormous realism.

713
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,868
You can hardly tell it
from the real thing.

714
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,471
The question is,

715
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,809
what are you gonna make next,
Walter?

716
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,312
Oh, I already have a new one.

717
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,648
Really? What is it?

718
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:14,820
Well, it's a full-length,
life-size figure.

719
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:18,790
What is it called?

720
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,159
"Murdered Man."

721
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:23,529
[eerie music]

722
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,230
"Murdered Man"?

723
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:27,499
"Murdered Man," "Dead Cat,"

724
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:30,235
Sounds a little bit like
the Warhol Mayhem series.

725
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:31,803
Exactly, exactly.

726
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:32,971
Very unoriginal.

727
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,340
[music continues]

728
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,309
Leonard, you all right?

729
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:44,650
[shakily] Oh, yeah, I'm...
I'm fine.

730
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:46,685
You don't look so hot.

731
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:49,220
Probably had some of the food.
[chuckles]

732
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,559
- [phone dialing]
- Oh, there you are.

733
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,494
I tried to contact you
on the phone.

734
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:57,529
Excuse me,
I have to make a call.

735
00:39:58,163 --> 00:39:59,431
I want the cat.

736
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,733
I'll give you
1,000 dollars cash.

737
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,535
I can't talk right now.

738
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:04,903
How much do you want?

739
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:07,105
2000, 3000?

740
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:09,274
No look, I'm busy.

741
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:11,309
I won't be overbid. [chuckles]

742
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,944
I am a very wealthy man

743
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,113
and I don't mind paying
for what I want.

744
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,414
[woman over phone]
911 emergency.

745
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,249
Yes, give me Homicide.

746
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,552
- If you ensure me the cat...
- [woman] Transferring.

747
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,890
...I'll give you
5,000 dollars cash.

748
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:30,462
[man over phone]
Homicide. Hello? Hello?

749
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,331
Uh...

750
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,302
I don't have the cat right now,

751
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:41,006
but I'll be getting it back
in a few days.

752
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:44,710
5,000 dollars, right?

753
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:46,912
Right, thank you.

754
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,981
I consider it a bargain.
[chuckles]

755
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,150
Here's my card,
when you're ready.

756
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:54,886
Good night.

757
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,428
Leonard, you feeling better?

758
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:04,763
[rock music]

759
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:09,568
Yeah, uh,
I'm feeling a lot better.

760
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,572
Listen,
I'm going over to Walter's,

761
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:15,140
after the place closes.

762
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:18,443
I want to get to look at
"Murdered Man."

763
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,911
Do you want to come along?

764
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:27,152
Come on, Walter,
take off the sheet.

765
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:38,764
[eerie music]

766
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,033
[dramatic music]

767
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,506
Do you like it?

768
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:50,876
Like it?

769
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:53,812
It's a masterpiece.

770
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,614
Um...

771
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:58,817
I have to sit down.

772
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,820
[tense music]

773
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:05,056
Can you feel it?

774
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,658
In all its eloquence,

775
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:07,826
can I, huh?

776
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,964
Modern man in all his self-pity.

777
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:16,201
How did you ever find it
all inside yourself, Walter?

778
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:17,903
It wasn't easy.

779
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,073
What's the matter with you,
Leonard?

780
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,310
Hmm? Nothing, nothing.
Nothing at all.

781
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:27,012
Well, what's your opinion
of it, huh?

782
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:28,479
[Leonard mutters]

783
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:31,016
Then admit it,
it is a work of genius.

784
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:32,183
I admit it.

785
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:35,754
We can bring it down
to the Jabberjaw.

786
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:37,355
No!

787
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:39,357
[sirens wailing in distance]

788
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:41,993
Why don't you cover it up,
Walter?

789
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:43,228
[Carla] What's wrong with you?

790
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,596
Why do you want to hide it?

791
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:47,532
Well, um, I never realized

792
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:50,869
the true depth
of Walter's talent.

793
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:53,404
It's something very precious.

794
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:54,940
You are right, Leonard.

795
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,574
And it's something so precious,

796
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,610
we should not keep it
to ourselves, huh?

797
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:01,079
We should give Walter a show.

798
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,981
What?

799
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:05,550
How about Sunday?

800
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:08,253
[stammering] No, no, no,
no, no, no.

801
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,756
No, that's--that's not possible.
Uh...

802
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:15,894
It would take years to make
enough statues to put on a show.

803
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:18,129
What kind of agent are you,
Leonard?

804
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:21,232
Don't you understand
I want to feature my work?

805
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,869
You will, but
these things take time, Walter.

806
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:26,404
And right now,
you've got to break out

807
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:29,440
of this one avenue you're on.

808
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,878
Carla and I will--
will guide you,

809
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:36,081
help you develop
and evolve your work,

810
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:40,285
maybe lead to something
more abstract.

811
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,988
Abstract,
with his talent for realism?

812
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:46,057
You see the direction
his realism takes?

813
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,225
It's unhealthy.

814
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:48,994
You said I was a genius.

815
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:52,130
If I'm a genius,
I don't want to be a busboy.

816
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:56,802
You know, you may
have a point there, Walter.

817
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:59,671
You shouldn't keep working
at the Jabberjaw.

818
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:04,575
Look, "Dead Cat's" practically
money in the bank.

819
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:09,180
I talked to a man today and
I think he's going to buy it.

820
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,183
So here's your half in advance.

821
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:15,854
25 dollars.

822
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:20,325
Now, if you need more,
I've got it.

823
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:22,593
I have faith in you, Walter.

824
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:27,498
Carla, look,

825
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:32,738
25 dollars for something I made.

826
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:34,472
- [door creaking]
- Let's go.

827
00:44:34,873 --> 00:44:36,341
Now you're a professional.

828
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:38,977
Goodnight, Walter.

829
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:42,613
What about my show?

830
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:43,782
[door closes]

831
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,184
Oh, hey, look,
get a load of this.

832
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:49,487
[upbeat jazz music]

833
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:52,023
[whispering]
He's such a bad boy.

834
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,825
What have we here?

835
00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:57,996
Excuse me.

836
00:44:58,897 --> 00:44:59,898
Looks like "Dead Cat"

837
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:01,699
- gave Walter some confidence.
- Mm-hm.

838
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:04,402
[woman giggling]

839
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:05,603
Hi, Carla.

840
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,739
Hello, Walter.

841
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:10,675
[music continues]

842
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:15,881
Cappuccino or something?

843
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,383
Yes, please, I'd like a double
latte macchiato, please.

844
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,550
Sure.

845
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,721
Walter.

846
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,025
The rewards of achievement
have come your way.

847
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:29,194
Maxwell.

848
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:32,330
Yeah, well, I'm starting to see
some success

849
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:34,365
- with some of my pieces.
- Excellent.

850
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,368
Yes, I was, uh, just suggesting
to Walter

851
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:41,539
that he experiment with
more abstract things,

852
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:42,707
right, Walter?

853
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,676
Why would you suggest
anything to Walter?

854
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:47,445
Are you the spokesman
for society,

855
00:45:47,612 --> 00:45:50,281
come to poke
your stifling finger in his eye?

856
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:54,920
Hi!

857
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:58,456
Maxwell, Walter,
how goes it, gentlemen?

858
00:45:58,924 --> 00:46:01,459
Who invited these two
down from the clouds?

859
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:03,594
[woman] Maxwell!

860
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,498
[sexy jazz music]

861
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:10,601
Clear the floor and
bring me a bowl.

862
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:11,769
I may be sick.

863
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:15,373
[Cuff]
Well, if it isn't Alice Ziobro,

864
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,042
here to spread a little cheer.

865
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:26,117
So Alice, where you been?
We missed you.

866
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:28,786
Well, I was up in Seattle,

867
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:30,455
working on a new video.

868
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,656
[Link] Oh yeah?
For who?

869
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,658
Petroleum Function.

870
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:37,395
- No way.
- And it's for their new CD.

871
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:39,464
So was it any good?

872
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,099
[scoffs] It was awesome.

873
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,635
Hey, don't you work here?

874
00:46:47,272 --> 00:46:49,474
- Not anymore.
- Yes, Walter has sold

875
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,576
- his first sculpture.
- Oh, really?

876
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,879
Alice, this guy's a total clown.

877
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,446
He ripped off our concepts.

878
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:57,048
[Alice] Oh yeah?

879
00:46:58,116 --> 00:47:00,952
You know, someone should
really burst his bubble.

880
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,354
So what project looms
on the horizon, Walter?

881
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,791
- I don't know.
- [Alice] You know, I do

882
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,426
life modeling.

883
00:47:09,094 --> 00:47:10,128
Would you like to do me?

884
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:12,463
I just might.

885
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:14,933
[Alice] Well, I'd be more than
happy to help...

886
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:17,735
for 50 bucks an hour.

887
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:20,038
[both laughing]

888
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:25,810
Never mind that, Walter's going
to try something abstract.

889
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:27,045
There you go again.

890
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,647
May take my business
to the Snake Pit.

891
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:33,218
Do you know, I was
going to suggest to Walter,

892
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:34,819
that he try female figure.

893
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:36,654
It might be nice, Walter.

894
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:39,657
If you like, I will model
for you, for free.

895
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:42,027
Oh no, not you.

896
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,694
I couldn't do that.

897
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,365
Would you, uh, pose for me
for free?

898
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,868
You know, Walter, if you wanna
be a legitimate artist,

899
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:52,737
man, you gotta do nudes.
[chuckles]

900
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:55,373
- I mean, nudes, nudes, nudes.
- Yeah, that's right.

901
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,741
No major body of work
would be complete

902
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,143
without at least some nudes.

903
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:01,012
Please, can't we just
change the subject?

904
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:04,115
I am so sick of hearing about
sculpture this

905
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:05,750
and sculpture that.

906
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:08,886
[scoffs] No one even knows
how to do it anymore.

907
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:12,690
Especially the bus boy
from the Jabberjaw.

908
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:14,926
Who do you think
you're talking about?

909
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:18,196
You. Look at you!

910
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:19,797
Who do you think you are?

911
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,300
You're just a poser trying
and failing

912
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,701
to fit into the scene.

913
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:26,271
Much the way
your breasts fail to fit

914
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:28,873
into your crimson frock.

915
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:30,108
Oh really?

916
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,509
Well, I think this whole bit

917
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:33,144
about him being
a discovered sculptor

918
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:34,379
is a bunch of bull.

919
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:35,546
That's not true.

920
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:39,084
- I am sculptor.
- Oh really?

921
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:42,920
Prove it.

922
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:44,089
[lips smacking]

923
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,157
Make something out of this.

924
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:49,794
[music continues]

925
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:52,397
How about...

926
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,201
"Flying Cake"?

927
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:02,440
[spitting]

928
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:07,478
Oh, my God.

929
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:08,813
[tsking]

930
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:10,315
You disgust me.

931
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:12,150
If you were a real artist,

932
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:13,918
you would have
created something,

933
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:16,321
but you're a fake and a phony.

934
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:18,223
And let me tell you something.

935
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:20,558
I see right through you.

936
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:22,627
I'm going home.

937
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:24,829
Good.

938
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,237
Good night, dark prince.

939
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:38,276
[tense music]

940
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,622
[siren wailing in distance]

941
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:57,495
[music continues]

942
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:22,053
What do you want?

943
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:25,323
I just wanted to apologize

944
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:28,159
for being nasty tonight, Alice.

945
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,062
All right, fine.

946
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:32,497
So you apologized.

947
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:34,365
Now get lost!

948
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,502
[tense music]

949
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:46,244
Look, schmuck.

950
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:48,613
I thought
I told you to get lost!

951
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:51,582
But I wasn't finished
talking to you, Alice.

952
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:53,684
Well, I'm done talking to you.

953
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,891
I decided to make
a female figure.

954
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,928
I want you
to pose for it, Alice.

955
00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:07,432
Oh yeah?

956
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:09,600
You got the money?

957
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:15,240
Uh-huh. 50 dollars
an hour, right?

958
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:17,775
Yeah, that's right.

959
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,778
50 bucks an hour.

960
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:25,216
[dog barking]

961
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:27,585
I live down here.

962
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,023
What, you mean you live
in the basement?

963
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:35,360
Yes.

964
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:37,162
[scoffs] Nice.

965
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:41,199
- [dog barking]
- [cricket chirping]

966
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:50,775
Good for you, Walter. Mm-hmm.

967
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,312
You know, could use
a little heat in this dump.

968
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:56,147
[thumping]

969
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,418
Well, it's bad for the clay.

970
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:06,924
[tense music]

971
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,165
[Alice] I'm almost naked.

972
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:19,470
[music continues]

973
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,019
Just sit there.

974
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:44,028
So. Do you like what you see?

975
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:47,465
Yes.

976
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,205
Hey, that doesn't look like
very much clay.

977
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,774
It's enough.

978
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,115
Are you, um, nervous, Walter?

979
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:09,654
No.

980
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:12,323
When's the last time you had

981
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,725
a totally nude girl
in your room?

982
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:18,162
Without a stitch of clothing on,

983
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:19,897
sitting, facing you?

984
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,132
A girl with a body like mine.

985
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:24,034
You're breaking
my concentration, Alice.

986
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:29,340
Can I ask you a question,
Walter?

987
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:32,743
What?

988
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,346
[laughing]

989
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,750
Are you still a virgin?

990
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,589
For crying out loud, what does
that have to do with anything?

991
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,392
It's just an innocent question.

992
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:51,396
And I just want to clarify
your intentions, that's all.

993
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,231
[frantic music]

994
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:58,836
Look, let's forget about
this pose,

995
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:02,873
it's all wrong.

996
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:08,913
Okay. I'll pose any way
you want me to.

997
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,581
Thanks.

998
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:12,550
Would you put this
around your neck, please?

999
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:14,419
[music continues]

1000
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:21,058
[dramatic music]

1001
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:31,302
- [whooshing]
- Would you like to do me?

1002
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:32,470
- [whooshing]
- [Walter grunting]

1003
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:33,638
[Alice gasping]

1004
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:35,840
Nervous, Walter?
[choking]

1005
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,575
[music continues]

1006
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,011
Do you like what you see?

1007
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:42,179
[Alice struggling]

1008
00:54:42,347 --> 00:54:43,614
[Alice laughing]

1009
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:45,616
Are you still a virgin?

1010
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:46,951
It's just an innocent question.

1011
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,386
[laughing]

1012
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:49,654
[crackling]

1013
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:56,461
[intense music]

1014
00:55:10,608 --> 00:55:12,410
[Carla] Here you go, enjoy.

1015
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,146
What's this sauce?
I'm lactose-intolerant.

1016
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:18,583
Is nondairy sauce,
made with soy milk.

1017
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:21,452
- Ah.
- [doorbell rings]

1018
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:24,789
- I'll get it.
- [operatic music playing]

1019
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,760
Well, if it isn't
Mr. Plagiarism.

1020
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:33,130
Good morning, Walter.

1021
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:35,232
- Hi.
- Walter, what's up?

1022
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:36,934
Well, I brought you something
and I...

1023
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:39,036
I wanted to show you.

1024
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:41,772
Is it "Murdered Man"?

1025
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,241
It's better.

1026
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:46,377
Man, this is heavy.

1027
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:48,078
Yeah, what is this,
Murdered Elephant?

1028
00:55:48,713 --> 00:55:50,147
When did you make this, Walter?

1029
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:51,315
Last night.

1030
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,385
Doesn't take me very long.

1031
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,524
Well, Walter,
unleash your vision.

1032
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:03,293
[operatic music continues]

1033
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:13,203
Walter, I can't believe it.

1034
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:16,140
She's beautiful.

1035
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,509
It looks like Walter
finally did his nude.

1036
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,378
Yeah, and it's pretty good.

1037
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,014
Walter,

1038
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,217
I'm honored to know you.

1039
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:32,423
Do you think she's better than
"Murdered Man"?

1040
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,592
It's really good, Walter.

1041
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:35,860
They're both great.

1042
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:37,762
[Maxwell] I'm moved.

1043
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:40,030
I'm moved to write.

1044
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:44,068
Tonight at the Jabberjaw,
I will recite a new poem

1045
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:46,704
and we will celebrate
in your honor.

1046
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:49,840
Yes, Walter.

1047
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,176
- [kiss smacks]
- [spring boings]

1048
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:54,945
[Lane]
All right, let's split up.

1049
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,881
[upbeat music]

1050
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:58,415
Try to keep a low profile.

1051
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,953
You hear anything,
you let me know.

1052
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:05,590
I'm getting' to
the bottom of this.

1053
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,727
Attention, attention everyone!

1054
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:11,428
I have something to share.

1055
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,632
- Order, order!
- [people shushing]

1056
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,767
Thank you.

1057
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:18,903
[chuckles]

1058
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:20,070
[Maxwell] Walter,

1059
00:57:23,808 --> 00:57:24,809
Walter,

1060
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,613
the bird that flies now
pays later

1061
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,482
through the nose
of ambidextrous apathy.

1062
00:57:31,649 --> 00:57:32,650
Hmm.

1063
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:35,285
Necrophiles may dance
upon the placemats

1064
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,954
in an orgy of togetherness.

1065
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,288
[chuckles]

1066
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:40,625
And in the deep freeze,

1067
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,928
it is the children's hour

1068
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:47,064
and no one knows
that Duncan is murdered.

1069
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:50,701
And no one knows
that Walter Paisley is born.

1070
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:53,704
Duncan knows.

1071
00:57:54,772 --> 00:57:56,641
Tuesday, sunrise knows,

1072
00:57:56,941 --> 00:58:00,845
and alley cats and garbage cans
and satellite dishes

1073
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,479
and you and I,

1074
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,916
and the nude
descending the staircase,

1075
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,418
and all such things with souls,

1076
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:14,291
we shall hear
that Walter Paisley is born.

1077
00:58:15,192 --> 00:58:16,326
[Walter belches and laughs]

1078
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:19,964
And the soul becomes flesh,

1079
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:23,300
and Walter Paisley is born!

1080
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:29,807
- [audience applauding]
- [crowd chattering]

1081
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:39,216
Man, Maxwell,

1082
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:42,252
that was magnificent.

1083
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:46,591
Yeah, you were so eloquent.

1084
00:58:47,792 --> 00:58:49,226
[Maxwell] Walter deserved
every word of it.

1085
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,897
Oh, man, that wasn't brilliant.
That was powerful stuff, man.

1086
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:54,599
- Eh, it was all right.
- Hm?

1087
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:56,867
What do you mean,
it was all right? You just
don't get it, that's all.

1088
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:58,335
- Oh, I get it.
- You don't get it.

1089
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,204
[stammers] Why do you keep
asking if I get it or not?

1090
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,405
- I get it.
- Oh, if you get it,

1091
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:02,573
then who's Duncan?

1092
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,009
Macbeth killed Duncan.

1093
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:08,212
Who?

1094
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,416
Look at Walter down the bubbly.
[chuckles]

1095
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:14,318
Drunks make great lovers.

1096
00:59:14,451 --> 00:59:15,552
They try harder.

1097
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,988
[Carla]
Congratulations, your majesty.

1098
00:59:19,824 --> 00:59:21,692
[music continues]

1099
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:22,860
Did you hear what he said?

1100
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:25,696
It was all about me.

1101
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:27,231
Yes, Walter.

1102
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:29,734
It's true, isn't it?

1103
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:31,501
Every word.

1104
00:59:34,872 --> 00:59:35,873
[chuckles]

1105
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,942
- [Leonard] Thanks for coming.
- [man] Thank you.

1106
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:39,276
[Leonard] Good Night.

1107
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:41,245
[man] Go get the car.

1108
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:47,918
[door closes]

1109
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,621
You might want to hold off
on the bubbly.

1110
00:59:51,155 --> 00:59:52,456
[tense music]

1111
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:55,225
Yeah, why?

1112
00:59:55,726 --> 00:59:57,762
You might talk too much.

1113
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,096
[scoffs]

1114
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:00,998
And what would I say?

1115
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,701
[music continues]

1116
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:07,237
You two grinders ignoring us?

1117
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:12,076
Oh, no, not me, Maxwell.

1118
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:14,979
I wouldn't ignore you,

1119
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:19,083
because I know what it's like
to be ignored.

1120
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:23,754
So, Walter, what are you
going to do next, huh?

1121
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:27,257
[tense music]

1122
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,732

[banging]

1124
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:42,707
Alley cats,

1125
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:45,743
garbage cans.

1126
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:49,013
They know Walter Paisley
is more.

1127
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,148
What are you gonna do next,
Walter?

1128
01:00:57,254 --> 01:01:00,791
Oh, I don't know,
what are you gonna do next?

1129
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,661
I better do something quick.

1130
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:11,435
Before they forget about...

1131
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:21,011
I know what it's like...

1132
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,614
to be ignored.

1133
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,317
[machine whirring]

1134
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,523

[baseball announcer speaking
indistinctly on radio]

1136
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,006
Who the hell are you,
what do you want?

1137
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:53,010
Life...

1138
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:56,847
is nothing...

1139
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:01,618
but a homeless man...

1140
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,056
on the bus of art.

1141
01:02:06,857 --> 01:02:07,858
Huh?

1142
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,899
Let them all crumble so that
they might feed the creator.

1143
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:19,036
[chuckles] Beat it, ya drunk,

1144
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:20,737
before I call the cops,
all right? Huh?

1145
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:22,006
Before you get hurt.

1146
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:23,473
Yeah, move along, pal.

1147
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:26,243
- [saw powering up]
- I'm sorry.

1148
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,218
All else is rice cakes.

1149
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:36,987
Get outta here,
you friggin' freak!

1150
01:02:37,154 --> 01:02:38,889
[crashing]

1151
01:02:51,635 --> 01:02:52,970
Son of a bitch!

No!

1157

No!

[man screaming]

1159
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:16,793
No, no!

1160
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:22,266
No!

[tense music]

1164
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:48,825
Hello, Leonard.

1165
01:03:51,528 --> 01:03:53,030
It's a beautiful morning,
isn't it?

1166
01:03:53,864 --> 01:03:54,865
It was.

1167
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:05,009
Wha...what've...what do you have
in the box, Walter?

1168
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,812
Oh, Leonard,
wait till you see this.

1169
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,456
[dramatic music]

1170
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:22,826
What's the matter, Leonard?

1171
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:24,628
[eerie music]

1172
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:31,835
Leonard?

1173
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:35,239
[laughs] You made a bust.

1174
01:04:38,342 --> 01:04:39,343
Yeah,

1175
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:41,912
isn't it wonderful?

1176
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:45,882
What's the matter, Leonard?

1177
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:48,785
Listen, Walter.

1178
01:04:48,953 --> 01:04:49,954
Okay.

1179
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:53,023
All right.

1180
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,961
I don't want you
to make any more statues.

1181
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:59,563
Okay, Walter?
Do you understand, Walter?

1182
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:03,633
I don't--no more statues.

1183
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:05,535
Why--why not?

1184
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,439
I have to make statues, Leonard.

1185
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,808
You heard everybody.

1186
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:14,444
They want me to make them.

1187
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:16,213
[tense music]

1188
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,315
I can't go back to being a bus--

1189
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:19,649
Look, Walter.

1190
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,118
Okay, now listen to me.

1191
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:23,687
You've got to stop this now,
okay?

1192
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:26,823
I'm beginning to feel
a little responsible.

1193
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:30,794
You are responsible, Leonard.

1194
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:33,397
You're my agent.

1195
01:05:35,232 --> 01:05:37,601
You're the one who started
the whole ball rolling.

1196
01:05:38,168 --> 01:05:39,669
Oh, jeez, Walter.

1197
01:05:42,306 --> 01:05:44,074
[music continues]

1198
01:05:45,342 --> 01:05:46,543
Hey, do you think
I have enough pieces

1199
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:47,711
for a show, Leonard?

1200
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:49,813
Uh--Walter, n...

1201
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:54,584
Wait a minute, Walter.

1202
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:57,654
You know what?

1203
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:59,289
It's not such a bad idea.

1204
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:03,960
Listen, when Carla comes by,

1205
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:09,266
I'll--I'll have her make up some
nice invitations, okay?

1206
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:11,268
And she'll get them printed up.

1207
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:13,103
- Really?
- Yeah.

1208
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:18,142
And--and we'll send them
to the critics and
the art collectors.

1209
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:19,643
And we'll tell them...

1210
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,046
Tell them what, Leonard?

1211
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,214
We'll tell them

1212
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:31,021
that this is going to be
your first and last show.

1213
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:33,890
Why?

1214
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:35,359
Uh...

1215
01:06:36,093 --> 01:06:37,694
It'll drive up the price.

1216
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,497
[chuckles]
We'll both become rich

1217
01:06:40,964 --> 01:06:42,732
and you won't ever have to make

1218
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,336
another statue again

1219
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:49,173
because you'll be a legend.

1220
01:06:50,774 --> 01:06:52,776
[operatic music playing]

1221
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:55,545
Well, I don't understand
why we can't go.

1222
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:59,083
Mr. Leonard DeSantos is afraid
to have you come.

1223
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:02,886
You, who buy his coffee,
his potables, his food.

1224
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:06,590
You who are the heart and soul
and meat of the Jabberjaw.

1225
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,192
He has slighted you.

1226
01:07:09,326 --> 01:07:10,427
You got an invitation?

1227
01:07:10,594 --> 01:07:13,397
I did not, but I'm going anyway.

1228
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:17,033
Not to drink his champagne,
but to witness Walter's triumph.

1229
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:19,002
After that, we shall go no more.

1230
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:21,505
Walter,
I won't wish you good luck.

1231
01:07:22,339 --> 01:07:23,340
Why not?

1232
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:26,876
That would imply that
you could not succeed
on talent alone.

1233
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:29,379
- [toilet flushing]
- Ciao.

1234
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:36,253
Walter, you look very handsome.

1235
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,921
So do you.

1236
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:41,825
I mean, look so pretty.

1237
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:44,027
Thank you.

1238
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:45,662
[Walter] Are you ready?

1239
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:47,731
Ready?
We have plenty of time.

1240
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,799
I know,
but I--I wanted to talk to you.

1241
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,836
Okay, we can leave right now
if you want.

1242
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:58,142
Well, goodbye, my friends.

1243
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,112
Have a great show, Walter.

1244
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:03,380
[door shutting]

1245
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:06,150
What are you trying to say,
Walter?

1246
01:08:07,217 --> 01:08:09,619
[tender music]

1247
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:15,592
Carla, I don't want to
make statues any more.

1248
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:17,127
You don't?

1249
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:19,296
No.

1250
01:08:21,398 --> 01:08:22,632
I want to get married...

1251
01:08:26,303 --> 01:08:27,304
to you.

1252
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:30,207
Walter,
how long you think about this?

1253
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,610
Oh, for a long time,

1254
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:37,281
ever since you first
came to the club.

1255
01:08:39,082 --> 01:08:41,585
You were the only one
who was ever nice to me.

1256
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:46,523
I didn't even know you loved me

1257
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,058
until you kissed me.

1258
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:53,597
Walter, I really do like you.

1259
01:08:54,264 --> 01:08:57,667
And I did kiss you,
but this was for your work, huh?

1260
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:00,204
There's more to love
than just this.

1261
01:09:00,537 --> 01:09:02,572
[tense music]

1262
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:04,441
What do you mean,
you don't love me?

1263
01:09:07,244 --> 01:09:08,712
I'm afraid
that's what I'm saying.

1264
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:13,417
You gotta love me!

1265
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:17,987
Walter, [speaks Italian],
I'm sorry.

1266
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,623
Yeah, I don't want you
to be sorry.

1267
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:21,625
I want you to love me.

1268
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:25,161
[speaking Italian] Calm down.

1269
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:27,864
Let's go back in there.

1270
01:09:28,298 --> 01:09:30,634
And then when the show
is over, maybe then we'll talk.

1271
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,503
No. [stammers]
I want to talk about it now.

1272
01:09:34,704 --> 01:09:36,806
Walter, I don't want to
hurt your feelings,

1273
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,542
but there's not going to be
a time

1274
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,177
where you and me
are going to be together.

1275
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:43,313
Do you know what that mean?

1276
01:09:43,647 --> 01:09:45,482
[gentle music]

1277
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,856
- Why not?
- Because we are just friends.

1278
01:09:53,457 --> 01:09:56,192
That is all, just friends.

1279
01:09:58,895 --> 01:09:59,996
[tense music]

1280
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:01,531
I'm going inside.

1281
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,669
- [Waitress] Champagne?
- [Maxwell] Ah.

1282
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:08,104
- [classical music playing]
- [people chattering]

1283
01:10:09,306 --> 01:10:10,507
You are too kind.

1284
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:13,443
[Waitress] Champagne?

1285
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:16,513
Walter,

1286
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,883
why are you wearing
the mask of defeat?

1287
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:22,619
I don't know.

1288
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:26,590
Haven't you heard the things
they've been saying?

1289
01:10:28,292 --> 01:10:31,328
They'll give you 50,000 dollars
for those pieces alone.

1290
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:34,564
I thought
you didn't care about money.

1291
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:39,068
Well, I don't, but it's 50 thou.

1292
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:42,171
[crowd chattering]

1293
01:10:43,139 --> 01:10:44,140
Thank you.

1294
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:46,743
Excuse me.

1295
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,648
- Hey, Leonard, great champagne.
- Mm.

1296
01:10:52,516 --> 01:10:54,183
Very nice little soiree,
my friend.

1297
01:10:54,318 --> 01:10:55,319
Looks very well attended.

1298
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:56,920
A little too well.

1299
01:10:58,688 --> 01:10:59,823
- Whoa!
- Get out,

1300
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:01,024
you weren't invited.

1301
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,360
[chuckles] What?

1302
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:05,962
- Get out, I said,
get out, come on, let's go.
- Are you serious?

1303
01:11:06,129 --> 01:11:07,631
- Are you throwing us out?
- Out the back so no one
will see you, come on.

1304
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:10,099
- He's serious.
- Fine, we're going.

1305
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,267
What's the attitude for?

1306
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:12,836
Let's go, you bums,
get outta here.

1307
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:15,405
Oh, bums, how are we bums?
And be specific.

1308
01:11:15,572 --> 01:11:17,106
Just make a road kill,
all right.

1309
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:21,345
[crowd chattering]

1310
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,586
I'm sorry about
what I said to you before.

1311
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,758
Ah, forget it, Walter, eh?

1312
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:36,493
I've been thinking.

1313
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:40,497
Would you let me
make a statue of you?

1314
01:11:41,765 --> 01:11:42,899
Would you really like to?

1315
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,036
Bene.

1316
01:11:47,504 --> 01:11:48,505
Okay.

1317
01:11:54,444 --> 01:11:56,646
[dramatic music]

1318
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:59,383
[crowd chattering]

1319
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:18,167
[mysterious music]

1320
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:22,305
[tense music]

1321
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,545
Where are you going, Carla?

1322
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:31,114
Walter, there's a body
in the sculpture.

1323
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:34,418
Oh, well, that's Alice.

1324
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:36,853
[intense music]

1325
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:42,325
Let them become the clay
in his hands

1326
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:44,528
so that he might mold them.

1327
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:47,363
Walter, stay away from me.

1328
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:48,698
Don't you see, Carla?

1329
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:52,368
I made them immortal.

1330
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:56,673
I could do the same for you.

1331
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:59,042
Get away from me, Walter!

1332
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,246
[door opens, shuts]

1333
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:04,814
[dramatic music]

1334
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:07,350
I love your articles.
I read them every week.

1335
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:10,253
Thank you
art is to be appreciated.

1336
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,457
For example, this work,
the artist is...

1337
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:15,425
Well, I'll be.

1338
01:13:16,593 --> 01:13:19,529
There's another work
inside this one.

1339
01:13:19,696 --> 01:13:22,165
My God, it looks just like
a real finger.

1340
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:23,600
[critic] It's unparalleled,

1341
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,471
it's reality encased
in a shield of whiteness.

1342
01:13:27,671 --> 01:13:29,606
No, it's just a finger!

1343
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:31,941
- Excuse me.
- [frantic music]

1344
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,578
It's reality, all right.

1345
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,179
[Walter] Carla!

1346
01:13:36,312 --> 01:13:37,313
[gasping]

1347
01:13:37,514 --> 01:13:39,949

[dramatic music]

1349
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:47,957
Oh, God, Lou!

1350
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:52,896
Precisely what are you doing?

1351
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:54,598
Stand back, asshole!

1352
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,401
- [plaster breaking]
- [crowd gasping]

1353
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,137
[dramatic music]

1354
01:14:01,304 --> 01:14:02,305
Oh, my God!

1355
01:14:02,472 --> 01:14:03,540
Paisley!

1356
01:14:03,707 --> 01:14:04,974
There's a body in there!

1357
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:06,142
- [crowd screaming]
- [glass breaking]

1358
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:12,549
Carla!

1359
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:15,418
Oh, God!

1360
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,822
Call 911,
get a patrol car down here now!

1361
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:21,024
- What happened?
- Walter Paisley's a murderer.

1362
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:22,759
I had no idea.

1363
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:24,494
Hey, we just saw that freak,
Walter,

1364
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:25,795
chase Carla down the street.

1365
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,697
- He looked whacked.
- I'm going after him.

1366
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:28,898
Well, I'll go with you.

1367
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:30,867
Be careful, he's a genius!

1368
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:33,537
[tense music]

1369
01:14:34,938 --> 01:14:35,939
Carla!

1370
01:14:36,139 --> 01:14:37,473
[Carla panting]

1371
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:46,482
Walter!
You get away from me, huh?

1372
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:51,187
What is the matter
with you, huh?

1373
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:53,790
What's the matter with you?

1374
01:14:57,393 --> 01:14:58,494

- [exclaims]
- Are you all right?

1380
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:13,309
It's Walter, he's gone crazy.

1381
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:14,578
He tried to attack me.

1382
01:15:16,212 --> 01:15:17,981
- [Lane] Where is he?
- He was going that way.

1383
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:19,148
- [Lane] Let's go!
- [Carla] Come on!

[dramatic music]

1392
01:15:47,644 --> 01:15:48,745
Hey, get in here!

1393
01:15:48,912 --> 01:15:51,447
He's down there
and he's gone crazy!

1394
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:53,650
Come here! Hurry!

1395

[dramatic music]

1396
01:15:56,185 --> 01:15:58,087
I don't want him in my house
one more minute,

1397
01:15:58,354 --> 01:15:59,388
he's really scary!

1398
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,224

Wait a minute! Here! Uh...

Oh, no, Walter!

1411
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:34,423
Unbelievable.

1412
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:37,927
This will command
a small fortune.

- [somber music]
- [rope creaking]

1414
