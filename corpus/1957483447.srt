1
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:05,249
Dot com.

2
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,208
Louis! Louis! Louis!

3
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,957
Well...

4
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:14,916
M-my... my favorite
sex position...

5
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:27,249
My favorite sexual position is,
uh, reverse cowgirl...

6
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,041
But I'm on top.

7
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,499
Are you picturing that?
It's good.

8
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,332
It's really good.
Nobody gets pregnant.

9
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,624
It's a lot of fun.

10
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,957
I'm trying to learn things
about myself.

11
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,374
Um, I got a scale for
my bathroom.

12
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,999
I'm not trying to lose weight,
I'm just interested in the data.

13
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,666
And I did learn something,
I learned this...

14
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:59,624
Because I weigh myself
every night before I go to bed;

15
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,832
and then I also weigh myself
on the morning when I get up

16
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,249
and I...
Here's what I learned...

17
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,582
I weigh two pounds less
every morning

18
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,332
than when I went to bed...
And I found out why,

19
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,582
it's because I shit in my bed
every night.

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,166
I do... I take a full
two-pound dump in bed,

21
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:20,958
and then I turn out the lights
and I go to sleep.

22
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:25,333
Because I don't want
to sleep alone.

23
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,707
Your needs change when you
get older...

24
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,332
At my age, a big... big pile of
shit's as good as anybody.

25
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,249
I actually have a girlfriend,

26
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,791
but we're struggling,
because she lives in France,

27
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:43,999
uh, she's French, she lives
all the way over there,

28
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,874
and we haven't been able
to see each other for a year

29
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,707
because of the disease.

30
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,999
I have AIDS.

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,082
And, uh...

32
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,499
She's great, though, she sends
me presents all the time.

33
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,082
That's how she keeps it going.

34
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,541
She sends me gifts in the mail.

35
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:02,207
I get something
from her every week.

36
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,457
Sometimes it's chocolate
from France or a shirt

37
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,375
she wishes I would wear
instead of things like this.

38
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,124
And sometimes she sends
something to make fun of me

39
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,707
because she's a little
fucked up,

40
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:17,041
so last time she sent me
a pair of little girl's panties.

41
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:20,582
And, uh... yeah, I was like,
"That's not funny,"

42
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,249
because these are
in my house now.

43
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,332
I can't get rid of 'em!
It's like nuclear waste!

44
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,207
Think of it,
I can't throw them out

45
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,957
because I can't have people
find little girl's panties

46
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:36,082
in my garbage with coffee
grounds and butter on 'em.

47
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:41,457
And every solution I think
of makes it worse,

48
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,499
like, if I...
If I put 'em in a bag

49
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,166
inside another bag and...

50
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:50,500
Layers of duct tape,
wrapped in tinfoil.

51
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,457
Or if I put him in a coffee can
and I nail it shut

52
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,750
and I bury it in the park
in the middle of the night.

53
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,000
Or if I cut 'em
into tiny pieces...

54
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:12,166
and throw away one piece
each week

55
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,083
in a different town.

56
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,416
My friend tried to help me,
he's like,

57
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:22,624
"Why don't you just burn them?"

58
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,332
I'm like, Do you understand?

59
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,082
Even if there's
a one-in-a-million chance

60
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,124
I get caught burning
little girl's panties...

61
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,874
So I'm wearing them right now.
So...

62
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:44,541
Yep... it's the only solution
I could come up with,

63
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:47,249
I wear 'em every day...

64
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,916
And I hand-wash them.

65
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,637
And then I dry them like this...

66
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,791
Just right on
the little strawberries.

67
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,124
Here's the thing: men...

68
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,249
our biggest fear in life is that
we're going to get caught

69
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,582
being a kid fucker,
that's every guy's biggest fear.

70
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,332
Even if you would never do it,
every guy's like,

71
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,792
"That's what's going to happen
to me, I know it."

72
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:22,666
It's like being afraid of sharks
when you live in the desert,

73
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:26,207
like, "I don't go to the ocean,
but it's going to happen."

74
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,499
'Cause it's a fear
not based in its likelihood,

75
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,832
but in how horrible it would be
if it happened.

76
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,916
Because when they catch
a pedophile, holy fuck.

77
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:39,249
Holy shit!

78
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,874
It's brutal...
Because we're scared,

79
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,457
we're so scared of pedophilia

80
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,874
because it's here
and it's not going anywhere.

81
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,332
That's a fact... it's not like
there's a finite amount

82
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,292
of pedophiles, and,
"We got the last one!"

83
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,249
No, they keep...
It keeps happening;

84
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,666
every generation, there's more.

85
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,999
Some of you have kids and some
of them are going to grow up,

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,416
and fuck kids, they might,
you know?

87
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:05,916
Okay, no, I'm... of course...

88
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:09,041
Of course not yours,
for some reason, but...

89
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,749
They're coming from some place.

90
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,957
So any real solution

91
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,332
has to start with
the basic reality

92
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,499
that there will always
be pedophiles.

93
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,207
Not a great thought,
I understand,

94
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,582
it's not an uplifting...

95
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,082
You wouldn't put that
on a fridge magnet.

96
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,000
Or on your screensaver
at the office.

97
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,125
"There will always be
pedophiles."

98
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,083
"Hey, where's Jim?
He's not at his desk."

99
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,374
We do... we have to start
with that reality,

100
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,582
because our solutions that we
have so far don't really work.

101
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,957
Here is our current solution
to pedophilia:

102
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,416
We wait till somebody fucks
about 10,000 kids,

103
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:05,166
and then we go, "All right, you,
you better cut that out."

104
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,124
That's pretty much it.

105
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,249
There is no measures
for preventing it.

106
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,707
None! We have no policy
to prevent it pe...

107
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:16,291
No, we're not even just...
Like a street sign.

108
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,624
There's a street sign
for everything!

109
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,291
"No hunting," "no spitting,"
"no skateboarding."

110
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:24,291
I've never seen a "Don't fuck
a child" sign in the w...

111
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:25,999
I've been all over the world!

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,457
Not even just like a picture of
a guy fucking a kid

113
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,291
with a line through it,

114
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,999
so that it...

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,332
transcends language barriers.

116
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,291
I mean, try it!

117
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:41,291
You won't get most of them
with the sign.

118
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:43,332
But even if one out
of 50 of them is like,

119
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,999
"Oh, shit, I'm sorry,
I didn't know it was an issue,"

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,667
that's money well spent!

121
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:54,832
There's things that might work,
and we don't even try them.

122
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:59,042
Like, is anybody working on very
realistic child sex dolls?

123
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,624
Okay, then let 'em
fuck your kids forever,

124
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,291
is th... if that's better!

125
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:06,666
I'm so sorry...

126
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,291
for suggesting something
that might actually work.

127
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:11,624
"Oh, no!

128
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:16,916
Let 'em fuck both my sons,
but don't make a doll.

129
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:19,375
That would be distasteful."

130
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:29,041
The thing is that this...
I'm still talking about it...

131
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:31,707
This... this problem...

132
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,582
We lose things because
we won't really face it,

133
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,624
you know, that are important us,
like the Boy Scouts.

134
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,707
Boy Scouts... wonderful thing,
being sued out of existence

135
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:44,749
'cause of all the kid fuckery
that goes on.

136
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,999
And I know it's upsetting,
because, look,

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,291
here's the thing: the Boy Scouts
is a wonderful thing for kids.

138
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:51,249
They go to the woods,
they work together,

139
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,707
they learn skills,
they get in touch with nature.

140
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,749
What could it be better
for a boy than that?

141
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,374
But some of those guys
want to fuck the kids.

142
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,874
I don't think they do it a lot.

143
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,749
It's not like there's just
a shit-load of kids

144
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,957
being fucked in the Boy Scouts;

145
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,374
I think it's mostly that

146
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,666
they find out
that the guy wants to...

147
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,749
I don't actually know, though.

148
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,957
I don't.
Do you know why I don't know?

149
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,582
Because I'm afraid
to look it up!

150
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,374
I'll go to prison for typing it

151
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,499
into a Google!

152
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,207
How do you solve a problem

153
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,957
if you're afraid
to fucking look it up?

154
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,832
"How many Boy Scouts
get fucked on a..."

155
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,332
"Oh, shit!"

156
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,332
Every time I move,
I've got to tell my neighbors

157
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,250
that I looked that up.

158
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,457
Here's what happens...
Every few years you find out

159
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,457
there's some pedophile-type
people in the Boy Scouts

160
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:52,082
and then they announce,
"We got... we got 'em all,

161
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,791
we're good."

162
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:56,624
And then a year later,
"Whoa, there's a bunch more!"

163
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,374
"What's going on here?!"

164
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,291
At some point, you've got
to wake up to the basic fact

165
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:08,624
that the... maybe the people
who are best suited

166
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,082
to give your kids
these wonderful experiences

167
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,499
are folks
that want to fuck them.

168
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,124
Maybe that's...

169
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,832
Maybe that's why
they're good at it.

170
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,624
Maybe that's... if you want
that, that's where you go.

171
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,457
Maybe that's just
the way that goes.

172
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,166
Who else would want to take
a bunch of kids

173
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,874
to the fucking woods?!

174
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,874
Who wants to take your shit kid
to the fucking woods?!

175
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,542
You don't want to take 'em!

176
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,791
Who else would want to do that,

177
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,332
except people that are
barely containing

178
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,166
that they want to fuck
every kid in the face?

179
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:39,041
That's why they're good at it.

180
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:41,207
That's what makes them
good at it.

181
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:45,207
I'm not saying that all
Scoutmasters are pedophiles.

182
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,624
I might be saying
that the best ones are.

183
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,666
I might be saying that.

184
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,166
That sounds right.

185
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,582
So I don't know... you have to
lose the whole thing?

186
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,624
Just tell your kids, "Some of
those guys want to fuck you,

187
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,375
just be careful,
have a good time."

188
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,874
Take the contribution
from where it comes.

189
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,791
Michael Jackson...
Wonderful music,

190
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,582
blessed us with
wonderful music...

191
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,666
Did some other things, too.

192
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,041
What... look, what's worse:

193
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,082
a pedophile
who makes beautiful music,

194
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,249
or one that doesn't?

195
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,750
This is the choices.

196
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,667
"No pedophiles"
is not on the menu.

197
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:38,707
So how've you all been enjoying
living the way

198
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,666
I already was for a couple
of years before all this shit?

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,791
Welcome to my life.

200
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:52,332
Can't work, can't go outside,

201
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,916
can't show your face,

202
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:56,124
gotta wash your groceries.

203
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,041
'Cause I got cum
on the groceries.

204
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:06,582
That's why I just... in my mind,
that's what it means.

205
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,750
Maybe that's not what
you're thinking, but...

206
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,457
I have a solution
for the pandemic, by the way,

207
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,749
for COVID, I have it.

208
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,582
This is it: We test everybody,

209
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,582
first of all, and every time
we find somebody who has COVID,

210
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,832
you kill them.

211
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,582
That's it.
That's the solution.

212
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,082
You won't need another one
after that one.

213
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,750
That's the final one.

214
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:34,041
It's been pretty amazing to be
alive during this thing,

215
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:37,041
during COVID, because you're not
going to see this again,

216
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:39,041
and, wow, did we
learn some shit.

217
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,166
That's really... the things
that teach you in life

218
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:44,082
are things you never would have
chosen to do for yourself.

219
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,291
I mean, think about your life
as far as it's been,

220
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:48,916
where you had the choices,
where you're like,

221
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:51,291
"I'm going to do this,
I'm going to pursue this."

222
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,041
It all goes to shit,
every bit of it.

223
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,707
And even when it goes right,
you're like,

224
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,666
"Why don't I like it?
It's what I wanted.

225
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:01,166
But why don't I like it?!"

226
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:04,499
Because it's your choice and
your choices are based on fear

227
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,666
and fucking just thin,
stupid, shitty hopes.

228
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,499
But when life just kicks you
in the balls and you're like,

229
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,499
"Oh, fuck,
everything's different now,"

230
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,416
and you...

231
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:17,707
It shows you shit you wouldn't
have looked at otherwise.

232
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,457
That's the great joy in it.

233
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,499
And what I thought was
really interesting

234
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,249
about COVID, and still is,

235
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,499
is that it's the first thing
I've seen

236
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,999
where everyone on Earth
had the same problem.

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,832
Every human being on Earth
had the same problem,

238
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,457
and we never had that before.

239
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,332
That's why we don't give a shit
about each other,

240
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,582
because you read, like, "Oh,
there's floods in Houston,"

241
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,999
you're like,
"It's fucking water!"

242
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,332
What is it? What's your problem?
Floods...

243
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,832
What does that?
Just walk like this.

244
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,666
What's... what, you can't handle
some water?

245
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,332
My basement floods...
What the fuck?

246
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,041
Who gives a shit?

247
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,624
Like, he's on a canoe
in the street...

248
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,958
"That looks like fun.
Why is that an issue?"

249
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,624
There's fires in California.
What...

250
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,082
Blow it out.

251
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,666
What, you can't fucking
blow out a fire?

252
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:05,666
Get the water from Houston
and dump it on California.

253
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,542
Fuckin' deal with it.

254
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,999
But we all had the same problem,

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,041
every person from Zimbabwe
to Tokyo to Newark to Honolulu,

256
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:20,916
everybody was doing
the same dumb shit.

257
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:24,582
Every person had the same stupid
fucking moment

258
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,124
at the same... just trying
to get the mask out of the well

259
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,041
of your car door, trying to...

260
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:33,416
"I got to go in Walgreen's,
where's my fucking mask?"

261
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,124
You try to...

262
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:39,458
It's got pistachio shells
in it and pennies.

263
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,333
Shake it... "I'm sure it's
still effective."

264
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,957
I actually like the masks,
'cause it just...

265
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,207
Everybody looked nice.

266
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,999
Everybody did,
'cause it's just their eyes.

267
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,166
Eyes are nice.

268
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,542
You never hear somebody say,
"That guy's got gross eyes."

269
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,124
It's really... we should hide
these, we should keep the masks,

270
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,457
because this is disgusting,
how do we just...

271
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,957
With no shame,
"Look inside my face!

272
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,416
Ha-ha-ha!"

273
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,457
Spit and tongue and teeth?

274
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,832
It's fucking gross!
Cover your mouth!

275
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,666
Don't...

276
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,082
I'd rather look at your asshole
than your mouth.

277
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,707
I really would,

278
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,499
I'd rather
stare into your asshole

279
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,458
than glance at your mouth.

280
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:33,666
Assholes aren't that bad,
not to look at.

281
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,457
We don't like to think
about assholes, 'cause, like,

282
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,874
you know, the shit and
the farts and the diarrhea.

283
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,417
But that's a small portion
of their time.

284
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:47,332
You ever really look at an ass...

285
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,707
You ever really look?

286
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:58,999
Mmm.

287
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,874
Once you see it, like in nature,

288
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,832
it's just... it's a little...

289
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,499
That's all.

290
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,374
That's your asshole.

291
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,832
It's like...
You know what it is?

292
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,749
It's just an aperture,
that's all it is.

293
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,332
That's your asshole.

294
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,457
It's like a camera shutter,
that's all it is.

295
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,791
It's like the opening to
the James Bond movies,

296
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,207
That's what your asshole's...

297
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,832
You ever go to lick
somebody's asshole

298
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,041
and there's a little guy
with a gun in there?

299
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,750
It was bad.

300
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,249
But it really was an interesting
social experiment,

301
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,041
COVID, because everybody got
told the same thing...

302
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:51,957
The whole world
got told the same thing.

303
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:55,667
If you go out unnecessarily,
millions will die.

304
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,499
And a lot of us said,

305
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,832
"Oh, I'm going out."

306
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,707
"Yeah...

307
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,958
I'm going now and a lot."

308
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:10,583
Yeah, and millions died.

309
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,832
Just, we're not that different
from the turtles

310
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,166
that you're trying to get them
not to cross the fucking highway

311
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,957
and they're like this,
"Where I fuck,

312
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,582
I fucked over there, fuck you."

313
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,707
And we're like, "Please stop!"

314
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,457
Putting little signs up...
"Don't go!"

315
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,207
And he's, "Fuck you.
I'm a turtle..."

316
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,624
It doesn't...

317
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,291
We're not that different.

318
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:36,499
We're just a fuckin' species,

319
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,249
and we're just rolling along.

320
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,541
Yeah, many dying
old ladies died.

321
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,207
That's what happened.

322
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:47,249
Many dying old ladies
finished dying.

323
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:55,749
Here's the way
you got to look at it, okay?

324
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,874
We're still making more.

325
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,874
We're making new old ladies.
Every day.

326
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,542
There's a fresh batch coming,
they're going to be great.

327
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,791
I was having sex
with a woman once,

328
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:11,582
and she was so beautiful, I was
having trouble not cumming,

329
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,457
so I pictured her face
at 80 years old,

330
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,207
and then I came immediately.

331
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,707
Because she was 92.

332
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,792
Anyway.

333
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,791
One thing I found
very interesting

334
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:35,416
was that during the pandemic,

335
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:37,832
a lot of people really liked
counting the dead people.

336
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,207
That got very popular,
was counting the amount

337
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,791
of the dead and dying.

338
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,499
"Do you know how many people...

339
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,957
Just today!
Just today!

340
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:54,999
Do you know how many people
died of COVID-19?!"

341
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,667
"Just today!"

342
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,207
When... why... wh...

343
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,291
Keeping a daily tally?

344
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:05,957
We don't do this...
A lot of shit going on

345
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,916
that we don't keep a daily tally
of how many...

346
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:12,125
babies were dropped
in a bucket of paint.

347
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,124
And I looked that up!
I'm not kidding you.

348
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,124
It's 30 a day,
it's a real problem.

349
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,416
I'm serious!

350
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:23,082
A steady 30 babies a day

351
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,832
are dropped in buckets of paint.

352
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:30,291
It's not random, it's one guy
that won't stop doing it.

353
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,332
Yeah, we liked counting them,
we liked counting the dead.

354
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,082
And when it got really high,
we didn't know

355
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,999
how to count them anymore,
people trying to find

356
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,707
different ways to express
the number or take it in.

357
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,332
Remember January?

358
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,416
It was really b...
It was 3,000 people every day

359
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:50,957
were dying of COVID,

360
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,999
so people started saying this...

361
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,333
"This is 9-11 every day."

362
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:06,916
"This is literally
9-11 every day."

363
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,957
When did we start measuring
deaths in "9-11s"?

364
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,874
When did that become the new,

365
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:17,082
"how many football fields
long is it,"

366
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,332
for mass death?

367
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,249
"How many 9-11s
was World War II?

368
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,124
Can we look it up?"

369
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,375
I know the Holocaust
was 2,0009-11s.

370
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:31,082
9-11 wasn't that bad,
it was just one.

371
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:39,207
Only one 9-11 of people died
on 9-11.

372
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,333
That's like nobody died
that day.

373
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:49,457
See, it's all relative,
because then you have those...

374
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,582
Later... remember, January
was really bad,

375
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,541
January was the worst,
and then in April,

376
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,832
March/April, we all felt
better, everybody's like,

377
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,749
"Oh, it's way better now,
it's way better,

378
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,624
"way better than January"...
I looked it up,

379
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,541
it was 1,500 people a day...

380
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:05,332
and everybody's like,
"It's way better than January."

381
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:09,832
Really?! It's half a 9-11
every single day.

382
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,624
But that's way better.
That would be like

383
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,207
if on 9-11, after the first
tower went down, you're like,

384
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,000
"Eh, that's not that bad..."

385
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:23,124
It's just one.

386
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,833
"Still got the other one,
that's why they made two."

387
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,416
It's okay, it's all right to...

388
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:36,166
make fun of 9-11, it was a hoax.

389
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,333
Uh...

390
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,042
All right.

391
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,041
Sorry.
Anyway...

392
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,457
I thought I had COVID
about three times,

393
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,874
I'm one of those idiots,
I was like,

394
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:03,166
"I think I have it.

395
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,749
Can you feel?"

396
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,207
I'm bad with pain too,

397
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,541
like, the other day
I hit my elbow

398
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:12,124
right on that spot
where if I had a gun,

399
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,874
I'd be dead now,
you know, that s...

400
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,332
I can't do pain.

401
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,124
That's why
I could never be a cop.

402
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,624
I couldn't walk around
with a gun right here.

403
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,207
There's 50 things a day
where I'd be like,

404
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,333
"Fuck that, that ain't worth..."

405
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,207
That's my main problem,
by the way,

406
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,207
with the whole
"defund the police" idea:

407
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,707
What about people who want
to commit suicide by cop?

408
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,417
What about them?

409
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:42,917
Anyway, we'll put a pin in that,
but...

410
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,249
We had a lot of protests
in New York,

411
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,124
and now we have protesters
that just live here.

412
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,457
They're not at a protest,
they're just here.

413
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,957
I saw a protester
in Washington Square Park.

414
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,292
She had green hair
and dirty legs.

415
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,707
And she's holding a little piece
of cardboard,

416
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,291
and it's... with a Sharpie...

417
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:09,582
It said
"Abolish billionaires."

418
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,375
She's standing there.

419
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,041
And I thought, "I don't think
that's going to do it.

420
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:18,541
I don't..."

421
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:22,499
It doesn't feel like
that's going to result...

422
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,541
"in Jeff Bezos going,
'What's happening to me?'"

423
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,292
Sadly, it's going
to be okay for him.

424
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,999
I think that... I thought it was
good how p...

425
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,791
How young people got out there
and they expressed themselves,

426
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:40,374
they went out there to solve
a lot of problems.

427
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,624
Not all the problems,
but some of them.

428
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,916
They went out there
to stop discrimination.

429
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,624
Uh, not all discrimination.

430
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:50,499
Just some of it, which is
a weird form of discrimination.

431
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,707
But there are groups...

432
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,874
There are groups that are
discriminated against,

433
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,582
the... who don't have
any protesters

434
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,666
or any people working for them.

435
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,999
And we all discriminate against
these people, like ugly people.

436
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,124
Everybody discriminates
against ugly people.

437
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,166
They do, and it's awful...
I mean, I'd rather be

438
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:09,999
discriminated against
for my race than for being ugly

439
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,166
because you might not lose a job
or a promotion,

440
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,707
but nobody kisses you
on the lips,

441
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,332
like, your whole fucking life,
like, try that.

442
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,874
This is what we say
to ugly people...

443
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,707
"We don't like your face.

444
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:22,124
Just don't like it.

445
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,749
So no one's going to
fall in love with you,

446
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,541
and it's unanimous... sorry."

447
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:28,332
And we just expect
ugly people to be like,

448
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:32,332
"Oh, no, I understand.
I mean, sure, my head shape

449
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,332
is no good for you,
so I'll... I'll with...

450
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,249
I'll go without the things
that matter in life."

451
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,874
Also, overweight people...
Overweight people deal with

452
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,624
things that
none of us deal with...

453
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,707
Because I'm not overweight.

454
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,791
There's people...

455
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:51,624
Who are discriminated against
because of their weight.

456
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:55,582
I read a story once about
a woman who was 600 pounds

457
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,666
and she couldn't get
medical care,

458
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:59,249
because everything...
She goes to the doctor,

459
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,707
he just says it's because
she's fat... everything.

460
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,082
She's like, "My knees hurt,"
he's like,

461
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,624
"Yeah, my knees hurt just
looking at you,

462
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,457
what'd you think
was going to happen?"

463
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,082
She's like,
"I have chest pains,"

464
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,249
he says, "Yeah, 'cause your
organs are over capacity,

465
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,874
so they are hurting."

466
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,332
She's like,
"I got shot in the head,"

467
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,916
he's like, "Yeah,
because you're fucking fat,

468
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:19,167
somebody shot you in the fucking
head 'cause you're fat."

469
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,166
It's a terrible story.

470
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,416
Here's the worst part of
the story,

471
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,332
and this is true, this is true:

472
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:29,749
she needed an MRI because
she had something serious;

473
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,499
she's 600 pounds,
she doesn't fit in the machine.

474
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,999
Do you know what they did?

475
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,249
They sent her to the zoo.

476
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,292
I'm not kidding, they sent her
to the fuckin' zoo!

477
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:45,249
That's what we do
for fat people...

478
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,542
who need an MRI!

479
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:53,083
"Hey, here's your
prescription... go to the zoo."

480
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,082
Yeah, that's where
you should go.

481
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,583
"You should go to the zoo."

482
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,582
By the way,
you know how many fat people

483
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,166
we have in this country?

484
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:09,624
About 600 trillion-billion-
thousands of 'em!

485
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:11,249
You know how many
trans people there are?

486
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,082
About 38.

487
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:17,207
But if you're trans and you need
a restroom and it's awkward,

488
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,832
we'll change every restroom!

489
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:21,124
But if you're fat
and you need an MRI,

490
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:24,916
you go to the zoo,
you fat bitch.

491
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:27,500
Just go to the zoo.

492
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,542
You go experience that today.

493
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:40,582
What happens when she gets
to the zoo?

494
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:43,791
What actually fucking happens

495
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:48,499
when she arrives at the zoo?!

496
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,249
"Hi...

497
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,916
Are you here
to see the monkeys?"

498
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:54,125
"No, I'm here for an MRI."

499
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,166
"Oh, shit.
All right. Yeah."

500
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:03,167
Uh-Huh. Okay, just stand
in the straw over here.

501
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:09,124
"Yeah, you're after the walrus
who has lymphoma."

502
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:20,499
By the way, why is there an MRI
machine at the fuckin' zoo?!

503
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,124
Who was it developing that

504
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,332
instead of
a fat-human-being MRI?

505
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,874
Who's paying for this shit?

506
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,749
You don't give an elephant

507
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,499
a fucking magnetic resonance
image test!

508
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,166
Are you fuckin' high?

509
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:36,291
That's obscene!

510
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:38,374
If an elephant is sick,
you just listen.

511
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:40,250
You do this thing.

512
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:48,083
"Me-sa thinks
she gonna die today."

513
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:53,041
I'm saying this out of respect
for elephants, by the way,

514
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:55,291
because we're supposed
to respect how they live.

515
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:57,957
They don't fucking
cure their diseases.

516
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:00,207
This is not their culture,
this is our weird...

517
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,624
"Let's fix it!
Oh, he's sick!"

518
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,666
That's not how elephants live!

519
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:06,666
An elephant in the Serengeti
isn't like,

520
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:10,208
"I have a lump,
I have to see my oncologist."

521
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,916
When an elephant gets cancer,
he falls over

522
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:19,541
and takes his fuckin' turn
and becomes food.

523
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:22,374
You don't put an elephant
in a state-of-the-art...

524
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,541
What if you find cancer?

525
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:30,582
What, are you going to
give them chemotherapy?

526
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:33,666
Think a skinny elephant
with a pink baseball hat.

527
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,207
"Each day is a gift."

528
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,666
I love animals, I do...
I do.

529
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,707
We have a weird relationship
to animals...

530
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:05,332
We name them
and we play with them,

531
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,249
and we kill them
and we eat them,

532
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,707
and we stuff them.

533
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,374
And we draw them.

534
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,166
I have a dog... I love my dog,

535
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:14,791
but I don't know my dog.

536
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:17,624
We've never had a conversation,
not one time.

537
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:21,166
I talk and she just hears...

538
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,374
She looks at me,
I'm like, "Yes!"

539
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:37,874
She's like, "What, you don't
know what the fuck I'm think..."

540
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,957
"Fuck you"...
I don't know this bitch,

541
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,332
I have no idea
what she's thinking.

542
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,874
I really wish I did,
I wish I knew

543
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:44,832
what she was thinking,
it's my biggest wish,

544
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:48,749
maybe, in life, is that I knew,
'cause I know she has thoughts.

545
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,124
I know she does.

546
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:53,582
There's no way she's just like,
"Dog."

547
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:58,166
There's stuff going on in here.
I've seen it.

548
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,875
You ever watch your dog
make a decision?

549
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:05,457
You ever d... watch your dog just
walk in the room

550
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,958
and then look around, like...

551
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:16,332
"I'm going to go over here."

552
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,707
Why?!

553
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,542
Please tell me why!

554
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,707
I think my dog thinks I'm insane

555
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,249
because I look at my life
through her... through her eyes,

556
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,874
like, I'll watch TV
for four hours,

557
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,792
and from my dog's point of view,
I'm just sitting there.

558
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:56,458
"What... the fuck is he
laughing, what happened?"

559
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:03,707
My dog is my life now
because my kids are grown up,

560
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,874
my kids are in college
and they're all, you know...

561
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,124
I'm an empty nester.

562
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,166
That's what you call it
when your kids are gone...

563
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,625
'cause they grow up,
not if they're dead.

564
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,082
It's not used that way.

565
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:19,249
"My daughter died of leukemia."

566
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,999
"Hey, you're an empty nester!"

567
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,291
I miss it,
I miss having little kids.

568
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:32,166
I think about it all the time,
I think about it...

569
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,749
Maybe adopting, you know,

570
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,957
I could adopt a baby
from a Third World country.

571
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:37,541
That's a good thing to do
because you can just

572
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:39,582
leave 'em outside,
you don't have to...

573
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,416
You know, it's interesting...
We've been adopting babies

574
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:49,749
from other countries in America
for a long time.

575
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,291
You know, other countries do it
too, but I live here,

576
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:52,832
so I'll talk about that, but...

577
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,541
It's an interesting thing.

578
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:56,124
It's not a biological imperative

579
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,457
to go get a baby
from thousands of miles away,

580
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:00,582
but we've been doing that
in large numbers here

581
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:01,916
for a long time,

582
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:03,874
and not always
for the same reasons.

583
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,874
There's been different reasons
why we've done it.

584
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,874
In the early, like, in the '70s,
when I grew up,

585
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:09,666
sometimes you'd meet a couple

586
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:12,041
who had an African baby
that they brought

587
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:14,666
because there are those kind of,
you know,

588
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,582
these kinds of people, you know,

589
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,207
the kind of couples
that hold hands

590
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:20,416
when they announce things.

591
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,249
You know those kind of people?

592
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,041
They gather their friends
and they're like,

593
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:29,124
"We've decided"...
You know those...?

594
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:33,500
They have a farm table with
a clay pot of honey on it.

595
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,082
And their apple juice is cloudy.

596
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:39,832
You know what I'm talking about?

597
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:43,874
Those are the kind of people
that make a trip to Zimbabwe

598
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,499
and get a baby
and name him Kevin

599
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,750
and send him to Boston College,
whatever.

600
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:52,916
That was like the '70s and '80s;

601
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:55,791
then in the '90s, it became very
popular with gay couples,

602
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:57,791
started to adopt babies
from China

603
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:59,166
because
they want to have a baby,

604
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,916
but they can't...
They both have dicks.

605
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:03,874
I don't know if you know that.
Did you know that?

606
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,749
Gay couples have two dicks,

607
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,374
so they can't make a baby.

608
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,208
You can try.
You can...

609
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,832
This is really fuckin'...

610
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,624
You could...

611
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:18,499
You could try to cum into
one dick with the other,

612
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,999
like, if you line up
to dick holes

613
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,082
and you could cum,
and the sperm goes up this dick

614
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:28,041
and down that one.

615
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:30,041
And then this sperm
gets to the balls

616
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:32,167
and he... and they're like,
"What the fuck? Where...?"

617
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:37,417
"Did we turn around? 'Cause
we're in the balls again."

618
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,708
Whose balls are these?!
These aren't even his balls!

619
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:53,082
Oh, he's gay. Fuck.
All right. Okay, all right.

620
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:55,500
"Well, just swim around
until we're dead."

621
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:00,207
It's just the way it is,
you're not going to...

622
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:03,582
A baby will never come out of
a penis.

623
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,332
Which is good.
It's a good thing.

624
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,041
Because it's hard for women.

625
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:13,582
Imagine pushing a whole baby
out of your penis, dickhole.

626
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,374
Even just the hand.

627
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:17,000
Yeah.

628
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,625
Anyway, so that's why
gay couples adopt.

629
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,499
That's why.

630
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,249
And often from China,

631
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,541
because they make
a lot of stuff there.

632
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:36,582
Uh...

633
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:41,291
So that was that, that was...

634
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:43,166
The gay couples
were adopting Chinese babies

635
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:45,291
because they couldn't
have babies,

636
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:47,707
and then... and then
a lot of other couples

637
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:51,291
started doing it more around
the turn of the century.

638
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:54,374
I used to live in Hollywood,
which is a pretty awful place,

639
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:56,457
and everybody there gets
Chinese babies.

640
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:57,957
It's very popular.

641
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,457
They go... because...
And it's not because

642
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:00,999
they can't have babies,
and it's not because

643
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,582
they're trying to help
somebody from far away;

644
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:05,541
it's because they're just busy;
they're busy...

645
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:07,499
They want to have a baby, but
they don't want to have a baby.

646
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,207
You know what I mean?
That thing where

647
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,041
you can't have your baby
and eat it too,

648
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:13,124
or what... I don't know how...

649
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,916
They want to get pregnant
is the point,

650
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:16,999
so they go to China...
They don't even go to China,

651
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,332
they go to the airport

652
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:20,249
and somebody from China
meets them,

653
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,791
gives them a baby... it's true.

654
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:23,166
They just take it home

655
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,957
and then they get
a Jamaican nanny

656
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:27,999
to watch their Chinese baby,

657
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,499
and they go to cocktail parties.

658
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,666
"We have this Chinese baby,
it's amazing."

659
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:35,249
And meanwhile, the Chinese baby
and the Jamaican nanny

660
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,374
are just alone,
looking at each other like,

661
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:41,582
"What are we doing?
What is...? What is this?"

662
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,917
Why can't either of us
see our families? Why...?

663
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,875
"What the fuck
is the point of this?"

664
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:54,707
So, yeah, my dog, I got a dog,
my kids are, eh,

665
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,582
and I just sit around
and watch, uh,

666
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:59,916
watch YouTube a lot...
That's my favorite... pastime.

667
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:03,582
Um...

668
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,749
I was watching YouTube today;

669
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,082
I was watching one of the ads

670
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:08,082
that comes on before the video

671
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,416
I wa... I don't skip those.

672
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:11,374
I think that's rude.

673
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,999
It is. It's mean.

674
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,499
Somebody worked hard on that ad.

675
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,042
They trained a cheetah to run
alongside a Jeep Cherokee.

676
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:24,082
And you're at home like,
"Three, two, one... fuck off."

677
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:29,042
Fucking mean... what if you made
something, dick?

678
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,332
Anyway, the ad was a PSA.

679
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:37,416
It was a, uh,
anti-smoking message.

680
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:39,416
It was a Puerto Rican man

681
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:41,082
with a hole in his throat,
he was like...

682
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:43,957
"My father smoked."

683
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:46,083
And my mother smoked.

684
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,792
I wish I never smoked
in my life.

685
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:56,707
Please don't smoke cigarettes.

686
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:59,375
"Cigarettes are very, very bad
for you."

687
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:04,249
First thought I had was,

688
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,916
why does he still have
an accent?

689
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,916
It's coming out...

690
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:18,333
Feels like if you bypass
the mouth...

691
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,417
You shouldn't have
an accident anymore.

692
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:28,708
Does the machine have a setting
for "Puerto Rican"?

693
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:34,499
Is that just how air sounds
coming out of this guy?

694
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,041
Does he fart with an accent?

695
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:39,500
"Senor, I'm farting!"

696
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:47,082
Anyway, after the ad,
I watched the video

697
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:50,791
that I was looking for,
which was a scene from a movie,

698
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:52,291
and it's a scene that
I really hate...

699
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:53,791
Every time I see it,
it makes me angry,

700
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:57,624
which is why I was
looking for it on YouTube.

701
00:38:57,625 --> 00:39:00,332
And it's a movie I like...
I actually like the movie.

702
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,707
It's called "Good Will Hunting,"
remember "Good Will Hunting"?

703
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,166
Of course, right?

704
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:06,416
Matt Damon played...
A great performance.

705
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:09,374
He plays a very complicated
young man

706
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:11,666
w-wearing a tight T-shirt
for a whole movie.

707
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:13,957
And here's the thing...
Here's my issue

708
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:16,957
with "Good Will Hunting"...
Matt Damon also wrote the movie.

709
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:19,999
Okay? So he basically sat down,
he's like,

710
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,499
"First of all, I am amazing."

711
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:29,916
"I'm a construction worker,
I'm, like, working-class,

712
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:31,791
and I drink beer
and I get in fights,

713
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:35,332
I get into so many fights.

714
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,291
My friends are like,
'You're out of control, man, '

715
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,875
and I'm like, 'Shut up
this is the way I am.'

716
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:46,624
But then also, I'm a genius.

717
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,832
Ooh!

718
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:51,249
I'm not... I didn't even go to
school, I just know things,

719
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,499
I don't know why...
I just know them.

720
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,624
And all the nerdy geniuses
that studied for years are like,

721
00:39:57,625 --> 00:40:02,582
"'He's so much smarter than us,
it's making it upset'."

722
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:07,249
It's insane!
It's fucking insane.

723
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,167
It only makes sense if he wrote
it for himself to be the guy.

724
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,582
So the scene I was looking for,

725
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,541
it's the worst example of that
in the movie.

726
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,207
Here's what happens.

727
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,249
He goes to a bar and he meets
a woman and he likes her.

728
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,124
And another guy likes her too.

729
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,499
But she picks Matt Damon...

730
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,916
because he wrote
the fucking movie!

731
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:30,083
Because he decided,
you understand?!

732
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:33,166
"She doesn't like him,
she likes me,

733
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:34,916
you better believe it!"

734
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:41,207
So he gets her phone number
and then he goes outside

735
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:44,374
and he sees the other guy in
the window of a restaurant,

736
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,166
and he decides to taunt him,

737
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:48,041
so he goes over...
He tells his friends,

738
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:51,041
"Hey, come here, watch this."

739
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:55,707
And he says to the guy,
"Hey, do you like apples?"

740
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,792
And the guy says, "Yes."

741
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,374
And Matt Damon goes,
"Well, I got her number.

742
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:10,916
How do you like them apples?"

743
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:14,374
And all Matt Damon's friends go,
"Oh-ho!"

744
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,791
Ho-ho!

745
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:19,332
This was amazing!

746
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:22,041
Oh!

747
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:25,166
Oh-ho, my God!

748
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,541
Oh, my God!

749
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:30,208
You were ready with that!

750
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:33,625
"How?!"

751
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,541
You know how he did it?

752
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:39,166
He wrote the whole
fucking movie, okay?!

753
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:42,625
He made everybody
say all the things.

754
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,082
Otherwise, this doesn't happen.

755
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:51,541
I mean, he hinges
the whole fucking prank

756
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:56,374
on the guy likin' apples;
the guy must like apples.

757
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:59,957
Who the fuck...
Who would say "yes"...

758
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:02,332
to, "Do you like apples?"...

759
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:05,333
Coming from a clear
antagonist...

760
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:12,125
who's setting him up...
Gathered his friends.

761
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:18,541
"Do you...
Ha, wait, guys watch this...

762
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:21,458
Do you like apples?"

763
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,375
God damn it, I do.

764
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:32,624
I wish I didn't.

765
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:35,625
'Cause I can tell this is not
going to go my way.

766
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:40,374
But I just... I can't lie.

767
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,541
They'll know it.

768
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:43,082
They'll know it's because, boy,

769
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:45,125
do I like apples.

770
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,707
Do you understand
if he says "no,"

771
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:50,207
Matt Damon is fucked.

772
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:53,541
He's fucked in the face
for life.

773
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:55,457
He's got nothin'!

774
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:58,416
"Do you like apples?"

775
00:42:58,417 --> 00:42:59,541
"No."
"D..."

776
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,082
"What..."

777
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,291
Dude.
Fuckin' guy.

778
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:09,749
No, come on, seriously.

779
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,916
Seriously, you fuckin'...
Don't fuckin'...

780
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:15,457
Don't fuckin'...

781
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:22,249
Do... do... do...
Do you like bananas?

782
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,791
Do... 'cause I thought...

783
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:27,499
'cause the woman gave me
her telephone number,

784
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,624
and isn't that bananas?

785
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,208
I saw a guy...

786
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:47,041
I saw a guy peeling a banana
the other day.

787
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:49,082
It's another banana joked,
because...

788
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:51,249
Did you hear the other one
ended with "banana"?

789
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,791
Banana... I got three
banana jokes, by the way.

790
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:56,624
This is number two.

791
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:58,457
Okay.

792
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:00,957
I saw a guy peeling a banana
on Sixth Avenue,

793
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,791
and it bothered me.

794
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:05,249
I'll tell you why, because it's
the way he...

795
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,499
When I peel a banana,
I hold around here,

796
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,291
I peel down to my hand, right?

797
00:44:10,292 --> 00:44:13,916
This guy holds the banana
at the bottom.

798
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:18,333
And he just peels the whole
thing all the way down.

799
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,832
It felt like a guy at a urinal
pulling his pants

800
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:27,292
all the way to his ankles.

801
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:35,249
I was like, "Dude, TMI with that
banana right now.

802
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,166
What are you making a smoothie
on Sixth Avenue?

803
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:39,042
What are you doing?"

804
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:43,583
The banana was like, "Hey!"

805
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:50,083
You don't even know how much
you're going to eat.

806
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,417
"I have a bruise right here."

807
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,500
Kind of got lost
in the banana shame there.

808
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,749
You wanna hear
the other banana one now?

809
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,999
All right.

810
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,082
Okay, so...

811
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:23,207
I was at the grocery store...

812
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:26,207
and I needed bananas.

813
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:29,249
So I go over
to where the bananas are,

814
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,457
and there's a Black woman
at the bananas.

815
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:34,791
It's going to be okay.

816
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:37,541
It's going to be okay, I swear.

817
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:43,082
I understand.

818
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:45,166
White people are very scared
of discussing

819
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:48,291
bananas and Black people
in the same conversation.

820
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:50,166
I understand... if I have
a Black friend over,

821
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:51,707
I would never
offer him a banana.

822
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,374
I just, I don't know why,
I just wouldn't do it.

823
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,541
"Hey, you want a banana?"
"Why the fuck you asking me?"

824
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:57,332
"Hey, man, sorry,
you have an apple?

825
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:59,499
I'm really sorry."

826
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,249
These are just
the facts of the case.

827
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,124
All right?

828
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:05,207
I was in a store,

829
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:07,749
looking for bananas and there's
a Black woman in the bananas,

830
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,624
and I wanted to...

831
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,291
I didn't want to go there while
she's there because of COVID.

832
00:46:11,292 --> 00:46:13,416
We're all
giving each other space.

833
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:16,625
So I... I...
But I do want to be next.

834
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,416
So I'm waiting.

835
00:46:21,417 --> 00:46:24,999
And she's kind of takin'
a long time.

836
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,832
And the longer she takes,
the longer I'm a white man

837
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:32,875
watching a Black woman
choose bananas.

838
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:37,874
And this is an awful thing
about the world today,

839
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:40,124
because I know
I'm not doing anything wrong,

840
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:42,374
but I feel fucking bad.

841
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:46,332
I feel fucking bad.

842
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:48,458
So I went to the strawberries.

843
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:54,374
And there's a fuckin' Jew
at the strawberries.

844
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:04,208
"Here's a nice one!"

845
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:12,166
That's the Jew.

846
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:14,874
I'm not going to do
the Black woman.

847
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:17,207
No, not... you know why?
Because I'm not afraid of Jews.

848
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:18,916
That's really...

849
00:47:18,917 --> 00:47:21,332
That's the bottom line.

850
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:24,499
I'm not scared of Jews.

851
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,999
I don't find Jews
to be frightening...

852
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,332
unless you're in Palestine,
then they're terrifying.

853
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,625
It's very different.

854
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,541
Over there, they're like,
"The Jews are killing us!"

855
00:47:37,542 --> 00:47:39,624
And here, we're like,
"Really? The Jews?"

856
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,625
"We've been slapping them
around for years."

857
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:55,833
Anyway.

858
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,041
"This banana's too hard!"

859
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:07,749
"Well, this banana's soft,
but I'm not gon' have it

860
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,624
till Tuesday, so...

861
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:12,416
I'm gonna buy the hard one
and wait."

862
00:48:12,417 --> 00:48:15,874
Just trying to be fair.

863
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:17,625
Just trying to be fair
to the Jews.

864
00:48:24,917 --> 00:48:26,374
"Lawd, have mercy."
Anyway...

865
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,958
Don't worry, I'm an old man,
I'll be gone very soon.

866
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:37,707
I worry about getting old

867
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:39,332
only 'cause I don't want
to lose my memory, you know?

868
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,749
I mean, some of it
I would love to lose.

869
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:45,499
But it doesn't work that way.

870
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,582
You got to take it all or none,
I guess.

871
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:49,666
But I lose...
I forget things, you know,

872
00:48:49,667 --> 00:48:52,749
like, remember Fonzie
from "Happy Days"?

873
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,999
I don't remember him.

874
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,249
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

875
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,666
I forget weird things, you know?

876
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:02,332
Like I was walking down
the street once in New York

877
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:04,707
and there was a guy in a van

878
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,416
and he roll down the window
and he said,

879
00:49:06,417 --> 00:49:10,332
"Hey, get in the van
and suck my dick."

880
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:13,457
And I said, "All right,"
you know, so...

881
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:15,749
I got in the van and, you know,

882
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,041
I was trying to pull the door,
the sliding door,

883
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:20,124
but it kept... and he's like,
"It just shuts, don't...

884
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:22,457
You don't have to...
I was like, "Sorry."

885
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:26,124
He's like, "Everybody does that,
it's okay."

886
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:30,041
So I'm kneeling
on the floor of the van

887
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:32,582
on like a purse, and there's
no lady in there, but I'm like,

888
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,332
"I came here
to suck this guy's dick,

889
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:36,832
not, like, take inventory.

890
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:40,082
I should just get to work,"
so I started suckin' his dick,

891
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:41,832
and about halfway through...

892
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:43,916
I'm guessing...

893
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:46,832
I remembered...

894
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,874
that, I don't really like
doing that.

895
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:57,624
So, senior moment.

896
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:05,999
Some people worry about getting
old because they think it means

897
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,416
that they're dying,
which it does.

898
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:11,541
But this doesn't worry me...
I don't worry about dying

899
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:13,416
because I think it's necessary.

900
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:15,207
I think it's something
that you just have to do.

901
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:16,666
You should do it.

902
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:18,332
It's... when it's your turn,
you should do it.

903
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:19,999
If somebody you know,
your doctor says you're dying,

904
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,874
just say, "Okay," and die...
Don't, you know,

905
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:23,957
"May be a miracle?"
Fuck you, get in the ground,

906
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:25,541
just take your turn.

907
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:27,916
I really think that way now...
I didn't used to,

908
00:50:27,917 --> 00:50:29,916
but I do, because I...
You know when I started

909
00:50:29,917 --> 00:50:31,666
thinking that way was when
my mom died.

910
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:34,791
My mom died a couple of years
ago of anorexia.

911
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:37,999
She was 300 pounds.
She was bad at it.

912
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,832
I know it's fucked up, right?

913
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:53,082
Hmm.
What a piece of shit.

914
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,291
Anyway...
She would have liked that joke.

915
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:58,083
She would have!
My mom, fuckin', she was gross.

916
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:01,832
And I remember
when she was dying,

917
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:02,916
I was... I was alone with her,

918
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:04,207
and the nurse said,

919
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:05,499
"This is... this is imminent."

920
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,124
I was like,
"What does that mean?"

921
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,332
She goes, "It's... she's going
to die in a minute."

922
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:13,124
I'm like,
"Just say, 'in a minute'.

923
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:15,374
It's so close."

924
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:17,332
Anyway, I was alone with her
and she died, and I was like,

925
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:20,042
"Fuck, they're going to think
I did it, obviously."

926
00:51:23,042 --> 00:51:24,874
I didn't want to lose my mom,
I really didn't,

927
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:26,499
but I... but we had this
one conversation,

928
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,374
like, two weeks before she died,
when we were...

929
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:29,791
We were talking about it
and I said,

930
00:51:29,792 --> 00:51:31,124
"Mom, I don't want you to die."

931
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:33,791
And she said,
"You'll get over it."

932
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:36,291
That's what she said!

933
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:38,582
And I did.

934
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:40,374
But in the moment, I wasn't
willing to accept it,

935
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:41,791
I was like,
"I don't want you to go,"

936
00:51:41,792 --> 00:51:43,416
she said,
"But we're going in order."

937
00:51:43,417 --> 00:51:45,707
Do you understand?
This makes sense.

938
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:48,416
I'm your mother," I'm like,
"Mom, stop talking like that.

939
00:51:48,417 --> 00:51:50,666
This is sad,"
she goes, "No, it's not.

940
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:53,332
Look at it this way, would...
Do you want me to never die?"

941
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:55,667
I was like, "No, I don't want
that at all."

942
00:51:58,292 --> 00:52:00,832
And it helped me get in touch
with an important idea,

943
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:02,832
which is that dying
is important,

944
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:06,582
it's every generation's greatest
contribution to history

945
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:09,041
is that they die.

946
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:11,999
It's the only thing that
keeps things moving;

947
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,957
it's the only reason there's
any progress in the human race

948
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:17,457
is that folks
keep fucking dying.

949
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:20,124
Every generation has had
a mix of douche bags

950
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:23,166
and amazing people and boring,
great, good, whatever,

951
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,041
but they're all fucking dead.

952
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,749
Every fuckin' one.

953
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,541
Thank God,
they're all fucking dead.

954
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:32,291
There's a limit to how much
any of the good ones did,

955
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:34,791
and the shitty ones
got to stop being shitty.

956
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:36,749
It's a great system.

957
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,041
Now, when you look at
the Internet

958
00:52:38,042 --> 00:52:39,666
and all these people,
you're like,

959
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:40,832
"What the fuck is happening?"
They'... it's okay.

960
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,207
They're all going!
Every th...

961
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:45,457
All of them are going to die.

962
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:47,874
I mean, you don't want to die.

963
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:50,499
You don't want to die, you don't
want your loved ones to die,

964
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,416
but that's a selfish wish
when you think about

965
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:53,957
what would happen
if nobody died...

966
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:55,999
What kind of world would this be
if there was no...

967
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,666
Nobody d...
If we still had people here

968
00:52:58,667 --> 00:53:01,166
from the 1100s?

969
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:04,999
It's hard enough having people
here from the '50s!

970
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,707
"Sir, just scan the code on
the table, there's no menu."

971
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:11,624
"What?! I don't understand!"

972
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:14,416
Jesus Christ!

973
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:18,041
You want to go through that with
Pontius Pilate and Charlemagne?

974
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:21,833
Fucking pain in the ass.

975
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,749
Fucking old people
that don't want to fucking,

976
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:27,832
just, when you get older
and you start going,

977
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,374
"Everything's so crazy now"...

978
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:31,249
No, it's fine,
just get the fuck out.

979
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,957
It's great.

980
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:35,166
They're not going
to make it work for you,

981
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:38,167
you're here for 10 more minutes,
just get the fuck out.

982
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,666
If you're in an airport
and you're looking at the toilet

983
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:45,166
and you're like, "I don't
understand how this works,"

984
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:49,124
it's time for you to die,
that's what that means.

985
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,542
These toilets are for the next
people, get the fuck out.

986
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:58,082
That's the way
I look at my life now.

987
00:53:58,083 --> 00:54:00,207
I had some good,
I had some bad, but I'm done.

988
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:04,166
I mean, I'm... I'll hang around
'cause I'm curious.

989
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:06,457
But I'm so interested in the way
things are going,

990
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:09,082
I really am, it's such
an interesting time,

991
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:10,874
such a... we're on a hinge,
it's such a cool thing

992
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,291
to experience that.

993
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:14,291
I'm excited about a lot of
what's coming,

994
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,707
there's things that are hard
now, but that's the way it is.

995
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,541
Things are going to get...
I think it's exciting

996
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:20,624
what's happening;
I think young people today

997
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:22,207
have some great ideas.

998
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,916
They're being a little cunty
about some of them,

999
00:54:23,917 --> 00:54:25,791
but the ideas are good.

1000
00:54:25,792 --> 00:54:27,416
The ideas are good.

1001
00:54:27,417 --> 00:54:29,582
Like, when I was growing up,
we had two genders...

1002
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:30,957
Male and female.

1003
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:32,374
Now you have
all these expansion teams.

1004
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:34,041
I think it's very exciting.

1005
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:36,332
It is!

1006
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:39,082
And the best idea
is this gender fluid thing.

1007
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:41,582
This is a great fucking idea.

1008
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:44,832
Gender fluid. the idea,
the way I barely understand it,

1009
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,916
is that you... you just...
Something in the middle.

1010
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,332
It's like a fretless bass.

1011
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:51,082
You don't have to be...

1012
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:53,416
The specific pictures...

1013
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:55,082
What a dumb way to do it.

1014
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,749
"These are the kinds of people
you can be,

1015
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,207
which one are you?"

1016
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,749
"I don't feel like
any of those people."

1017
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,291
"Then you're a failure.
You have to fi...

1018
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:06,207
Start acting like these people

1019
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:08,249
so we know what to call you."

1020
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:11,791
Why?! Just make it a...
It's just a... pbbt,

1021
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:14,041
What, just...

1022
00:55:14,042 --> 00:55:16,291
A la carte, "I like dicks,
I don't like balls,

1023
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:18,166
I'm a...

1024
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:20,416
this and... moving through it,

1025
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,666
changing when it feels like it."

1026
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,874
I wish... what I'm saying is
I wish we had that

1027
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:27,624
when I was a kid,
because I think our generation

1028
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:30,332
got hurt by the rigidity
of identities

1029
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:32,124
and how you had to just stick
to them.

1030
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:33,541
You didn't pick one right away.

1031
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:35,332
You're eight years old,
"What are you?"

1032
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:36,707
"I'm a... I'm a boy."

1033
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,999
"What do you like?"
"Uh, girls...

1034
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,957
Vaginas!

1035
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,499
Love vaginas!"
I'm eight years old,

1036
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,207
I never saw one,

1037
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:48,791
but I'm committing my life
to them right now.

1038
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:51,999
I don't even get to smell one
for a second!

1039
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,958
Just a sniff!

1040
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,166
"All right, what else you got?"

1041
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:13,749
Ten years old, "Are you gay?"
"No, no, no, I hate dicks,

1042
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,207
hate 'em."

1043
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:17,624
What do I know?
I didn't even get to

1044
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,624
fidget with one for a minute!

1045
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,207
"This banana's too hard!"

1046
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:35,999
I'm not saying I wish I could
have blown all my friends

1047
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,957
to see what it's like.

1048
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:40,374
But on 4th of July,
there were fireworks,

1049
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:42,666
I was with Matt,
there was a feeling...

1050
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:44,916
I don't know
what could have happened.

1051
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:46,957
I have no idea...

1052
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:48,541
Because we were so scared.

1053
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,916
We were so...
We were afraid to seem gay

1054
00:56:50,917 --> 00:56:53,166
when I was a kid,
'cause in the '70s,

1055
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:55,207
the stereotypes showed you
what everybody is like.

1056
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:57,041
Men are like this.

1057
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:58,916
And then the
women have to act like this,

1058
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:00,791
and then gay people are like...

1059
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,999
they're just tired.

1060
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,791
That was gay people in the '70s.

1061
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:05,374
"I'm gay.

1062
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:08,832
Help, I'm gay,
I can't even do anything."

1063
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:10,499
That's what gay men were
in the '70s.

1064
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,957
You ever meet a gay person?

1065
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:14,166
You don't fuck with gay people,
not today.

1066
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:16,957
They're all athletes,
first of all.

1067
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:18,499
And they... they got
their shit together.

1068
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,124
They're fucking... their
motherfuckers, gay people.

1069
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:22,916
Your landlord's gay.

1070
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:24,749
They're billionaires!
They own Apple.

1071
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:27,707
They're in the cabinet,
they're in the Navy.

1072
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:29,916
They're... they're... they're
cowboys and Indians

1073
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:31,749
and construction workers.

1074
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,541
Gay men are men.

1075
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:36,332
You ever go in a gay-owned
business?

1076
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:37,457
He's like, "Can I help you?"

1077
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:39,291
Like, the gay's in there,

1078
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:41,832
but he's fucking tough now.

1079
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:45,957
"This is my store, motherfucker,
what do you want?"

1080
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:47,416
Gay men are men now.

1081
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:49,124
They're... they're fathers,
they're husbands,

1082
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:50,541
they're men.

1083
00:57:50,542 --> 00:57:53,916
Today's heterosexual men
are faggots.

1084
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:55,791
I don't know how that happened!

1085
00:57:55,792 --> 00:57:58,707
And I... but they're fags!

1086
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:03,124
I'm saying that with love
and as an old man

1087
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:06,374
on his way out the door,
but they're fucking fags!

1088
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:08,166
They're intelligent
and they're evolved,

1089
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:10,582
but they're fags,
with the pajama shorts?!

1090
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:14,957
And the... just pale,
almost blue.

1091
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:18,457
"Mm, my wife got
a promotion today."

1092
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:20,582
Oh, good for you, faggot.
I'm so happy.

1093
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:23,207
I am! I'm happy for him!
Sounds like a good...

1094
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,167
They have a good life together.

1095
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:28,916
But it takes some
getting used to for me...

1096
00:58:28,917 --> 00:58:30,832
When I see
a progressive young couple,

1097
00:58:30,833 --> 00:58:33,207
I always want to stop them
and ask her,

1098
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:36,332
"Is that turning you on?
Please tell me, is that sexy?"

1099
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:40,749
He... with the Tin Man's
hand pipe, just...

1100
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,042
Strawberry smoke.
"Pbbt!"

1101
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,999
She's like,
Well, he's very intelligent

1102
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,416
"and he's conscientious"...
But does he make your pussy wet?

1103
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:51,124
"Fuck, no, he's a fag.

1104
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:52,917
But I love him."

1105
00:58:54,542 --> 00:58:57,332
And again, great,
it's another kind of dude,

1106
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,957
"faggy straight dude,"
it's another kind of guy.

1107
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:02,666
Welcome!

1108
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:04,874
We should have all of it,
the whole spectrum,

1109
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,207
the whole alphabet, all of it.

1110
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:10,207
But somebody does have to be
just a straight fucking.

1111
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:12,041
You have to have that.

1112
00:59:12,042 --> 00:59:13,707
It doesn't have to be the most
important, but you do need it

1113
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:16,291
because it's where it all
fuckin' comes from.

1114
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:17,916
Until they figure out
some other shit,

1115
00:59:17,917 --> 00:59:19,582
this is where life still starts.

1116
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:23,332
If... if you want to eat local
and organic,

1117
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:26,624
you got to respect that
someone's got to have

1118
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,374
a hard dick fucking a pussy.

1119
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:32,291
That's... that's where every
trans, every gay person,

1120
00:59:32,292 --> 00:59:36,041
came from... two boring
straight people fucking.

1121
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:39,499
I mean, that's just... for now,

1122
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,541
it's... someone needs...
You could...

1123
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:44,541
With an original dick,
not a turned-inside-out pussy

1124
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:46,416
wrapped in thigh flesh...

1125
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:49,541
Which is wonderful!
Wonderful!

1126
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:51,749
You got to respect that!
You do!

1127
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,499
Somebody who wants
to be themselves so bad

1128
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,166
they rip their balls off...
That takes balls to do that.

1129
00:59:57,167 --> 01:00:00,332
It does!
Fuckin' respect!

1130
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:04,957
But someone's got
to have a factory dick

1131
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,957
with matching numbers,

1132
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:10,624
fucking a wet,
farm-raised pussy.

1133
01:00:15,417 --> 01:00:17,916
Thank you very much.
Good night, everybody.

1134
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:21,249
Thank you.
