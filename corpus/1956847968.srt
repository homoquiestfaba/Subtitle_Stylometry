1
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,737
( narrator )
Now, believe it or not,
I've been known to lie.

2
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,874
But this here's
a true story.

3
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:46,378
The desire for food sometimes
makes strange bedfellers.

4
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,114
And that's where Ren Hoek
and Stimpy come in.

5
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,249
That's Hoek,
you idiot.

6
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,384
Not hoooke.

7
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,053
Natural enemies in the wild,

8
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,788
the cat and
the asthma hound chihuahua

9
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,825
have united in the face
of adversity.

10
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:04,863
Now, old man hunger was just
a-Gnawing at their bellies.

11
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,068
Why, heck, even
a dad-gum crust of bread

12
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,704
could look mighty
appetizing.

13
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,839
Excepting, of course,
if it happened to be some

14
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,741
other feller's lunch.

15
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:20,679
And old man pigeon wasn't
about to give up his meal.

16
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,385
( thunder )

17
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,021
Well, it looks like old man
lady luck just about run out

18
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,224
on these two fellers.

19
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,859
But always remember,

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,829
when the black, hoary
clouds of despair

21
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,630
darken your doorstep,

22
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,000
look for that
one ray of hope,

23
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,137
come a-shining down
from above.

24
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,642
♪ Hallelujah ♪

25
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,679
hot diggity dog !

26
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,015
I filled my quota

27
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,162
( man )
You boys are gonna

28
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:13,465
We're gonna have
a lot of fun here.

29
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,702
You boys like to
have fun, don't you ?

30
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,203
Yeah, sure.

31
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,071
Fun.

32
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,906
Anything you say.

33
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,708
Go ahead, have fun.

34
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,544
See if I care.

35
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,225
Yeah !

36
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,427
This is the life.

37
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,663
A square meal a day,
a roof over your head.

38
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,832
What do you
think, boys ?

39
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,567
Yes, food, shelter.

40
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:52,004
Yep, nothing can
go wrong here.

41
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,173
Take it from Phil !

42
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,383
Hey, jasper.

43
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,818
Where are they
taking Phil ?

44
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,820
He's going to sleep.

45
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,388
( yawning )
Oh, great.

46
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,891
I could use
a nap myself.

47
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,212
( snoring )

48
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,347
( rooster crowing )

49
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,515
Oh, my darling.

50
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,350
My little cucaracha.

51
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:42,521
I kiss your sleep-encrusted
eyes of morning.

52
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:48,127
I caress your
large, bulbous nose.

53
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,261
Let us join lips

54
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,364
in one final sweet
exchange of saliva.

55
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,938
( screaming )

56
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,340
I've been poisoned !

57
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,442
I must wash myself.

58
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,282
What's the matter
with you, man ?

59
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,951
Have you no
sense of hygiene ?

60
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,359
Hey, jasper,
where's Phil ?

61
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,861
I told you,
they put him to sleep.

62
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,530
So wake him up !

63
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:28,667
You don't wake up
from the big sleep.

64
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,469
The big sleep.

65
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,137
The big sleep ?

66
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,405
The big sleep ?

67
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,308
The big sleep ?

68
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,780
( crying )

69
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,616
What's the big
sleep, Ren ?

70
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,022
It's dead !

71
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,056
Dead, you idiot !

72
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,191
Do you know
what dead is ?

73
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:52,991
Just like we'll be,

74
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,027
if we don't
get outta here !

75
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,730
( crying )

76
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,251
What ?

77
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,153
Don't do it, Ren.

78
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,966
I'm covered
with hairballs.

79
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,334
You filthy dope !

80
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,635
You fat, bloated idiot !

81
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,569
You worm !

82
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,438
You stupid--

83
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,514
mommy, mommy, I want
the cute little poodle !

84
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,057
Oh, he's adorable !

85
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,458
I'm gonna take you home
and love you and feed you

86
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:04,163
and fix you and kiss you
and everything !

87
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,800
( laughing )

88
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:12,271
I'm alive, I'm alive,
I'm alive, I'm alive...

89
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,073
I'm out of here !

90
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,514
( grunting )

91
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,517
Stop !

92
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,518
You can't have me,

93
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,388
unless you take
Stimpy, too.

94
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,523
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah !

95
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,259
Please, please,
god, please !

96
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,395
Mmm... okay !

97
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,385
Oh, just look at you
cute little things.

98
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,354
What's this ?

99
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:08,427
And do we have a gift for
our big, brainless puddy ?

100
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:12,197
Of course we do, yeah.

101
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,467
My first material
possession !

102
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,370
Oh, joy !

103
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,906
I can hardly
wait to try it.

104
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,010
( coughing )
