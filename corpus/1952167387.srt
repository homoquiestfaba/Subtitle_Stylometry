1
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,212
Help me, Lora.

2
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:02,004
Pick up.

3
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:06,775
Come on, pick up.

4
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,465
Hi, this is Ashley. I'm not available right now,
but if you leave your name and phone number,

5
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:17,265
I will call you as soon as possible.

6
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:20,182
Ashley, it's me. Can you just call me back
as soon as you get this.

7
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:31,315
Damn it, Ashley, pick up the phone.

8
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:46,487
What is that?
Weren't they supposed to come home last night?

9
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:54,095
You know what ?
I'm never gonna pass Chemistry.

10
00:03:55,285 --> 00:03:58,376
Well, maybe if you study more,
and spend less time.....

11
00:03:58,376 --> 00:04:03,120
I'm, uh, I'm studying.
It's just..

12
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,173
I'm just not good at science.
Mr. Carl hates me.

13
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:07,166
Yeah, right.

14
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,850
Good morning.

15
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,643
Hi dad.

16
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:29,093
What happened?
You're supposed to be home last night.

17
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:30,235
I tried to call you.

18
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:32,812
I'm sorry, honey.
I must have turned my phone off.

19
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:35,340
O0oh, coffee ?

20
00:04:42,888 --> 00:04:46,960
We had a late dinner meeting,
with one of our biggest clients.

21
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,853
And we got for a drink after.

22
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,937
Didn't Chris know that meant you
have to drive all night?

23
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:56,412
Honey, it is business.
You know, sometimes you have to humor those people.

24
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:59,501
What, especially these guys,
the kind of money they spent.

25
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:05,926
I'm tired.

26
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:09,110
You okay ?
- I'm fine.

27
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,787
I'm just busy planning the church fundraiser.

28
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:17,939
You shouldn't take up responsibility at the church.

29
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:20,472
I'll be okay.

30
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:24,441
Besides, I like being feeling like I'm doing something good.

31
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,862
Look, things are going to slow down soon,
I promise.

32
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:35,760
And I'll take some time off,
we'll go on a vacation.

33
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,975
I promise.

34
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:46,650
We'll go some place fun.

35
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:51,089
We can go to my dad's farm ?

36
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:55,734
No, I want some place fun.

37
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,862
I can take Carolyn to school,
if you need a break.

38
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:19,647
Does anybody have any question?

39
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:24,947
Why is this picture so depressing?
- The artist wants to convey sorrow and sadness.

40
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:29,134
He even picked a background that
reflect the model's emotions.

41
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:34,185
Why is the picture so blurry ? Looks like the photographer move thecamera during long exposure.

42
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:38,727
That's actually a very good question.
He wants the image to look more like..

43
00:06:38,727 --> 00:06:43,898
faded memory, or a painting.
Not just a simple portrait.

44
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,453
Alright guys, that's actually it for today.
And, next week assignment..

45
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:57,108
..try thinking outside of the box,
don't worry about the rules,

46
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:59,639
bring me something creative.

47
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,114
Just be different.

48
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,480
U hahev no messages.
- Hello.

49
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,890
Hey, Mr. McDowell.

50
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,430
Lora, you look a bit stressed.
Is everything alright?

51
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,207
Everyhting is fine, I just didn't get
enough sleep last night.

52
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:19,024
Are you finished for the day?
- Classes, yes. But I still-

53
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,741
have this stuff to do for a project.

54
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,499
Why don't you go home and get some rest, my dear.

55
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:26,527
I can't.
My deadline is tomorrow.

56
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,147
Listen, don't try to take it all in..

57
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:33,702
I assure you tomorrow night's activities,

58
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:36,045
are rather important to the university.

59
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:40,300
I know, Mr. McDowell.
I'll trym thank you.

60
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:45,931
Barry, long time no see.

61
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:49,882
Yeah, no know, working, the usual.

62
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:53,886
Still wearing those silly thing?
It's not so nice in here.

63
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:58,057
Yeah, I know.
I'm just being extra careful, I guess.

64
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,303
Better safe than sorry.

65
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:10,066
What is it this time?

66
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,596
Is everything okay?

67
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:15,492
I didn't get any sleep.
Did you and Peter have a fight again ?

68
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:17,686
Peter and I are done.

69
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:26,366
Help me.

70
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:52,570
MacGey's.

71
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,554
May I speak with Ashley Gerritsen, please?

72
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,787
Who's this?
- It's her sister.

73
00:10:56,787 --> 00:11:01,296
Sorry, she's not here right now.
- Can you tell me the next time she works?

74
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:04,488
She's off today, I think
she'll come tomorrow.

75
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:26,446
Hi, this is Ashley.
Can get to the phone right now, but..

76
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,043
We have this bond.

77
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:50,509
When she's sad, I am too.

78
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:54,436
Or when something's wrong,
I can feel it.

79
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:58,505
If she's in pain,
or if somebody hurts her..

80
00:12:58,505 --> 00:13:00,303
then it hurts me too.

81
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:05,429
You have no idea how life has been.

82
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:10,147
I mean, having a twin in a lot of ways is difficult,
I don't think people realised.

83
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:13,681
What do you mean?
- I mean, it's like we belong together, like one person.

84
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:16,841
It's never Lora or Ashley,
it's the twins.

85
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:20,309
I'm responsible for her actions,
and it's not fair.

86
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:24,462
I know I'm sounding to selfish right now.
But..

87
00:13:24,462 --> 00:13:25,832
Not at all.

88
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:28,980
Having your own identity is crucial to every aspect of ..

89
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,342
your physchological development.

90
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:35,442
Resenting your sister is very normal
in this kind of situation.

91
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,586
You said you've been having dreams about her?

92
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:43,876
Didn't you say that you two have only recently
established your relationship..

93
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:45,852
together, is that correct ?

94
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,630
I just ...

95
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,756
I just wanna fixed her,
I can't.

96
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:02,445
Stop it.

97
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:06,136
Seriously, stop it.

98
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,511
Stop!

99
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:10,132
Stop it.

100
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,631
Ashley, don't.

101
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,403
God damn it, Lora.

102
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:53,175
What the hell did you do ?

103
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,070
Lora, are you alright?

104
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,932
You know what,
I'm sorry, I can't talk about this right now.

105
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:04,060
I can't do this anymore.

106
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:21,572
<i>Hi, this is Ashley.
I can't get to you right now ..</i>

107
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:36,844
Lora.

108
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:41,712
I didn't think you're coming?
- Well, I wasn't gonna come, but..

109
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,276
..very glad I did.

110
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:48,522
Is it fine if I get a candid picture of you two ?
- Actually ..

111
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:52,490
Sure, go ahead.
- Alright, smile for me.

112
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:55,053
Thank you guys, have a good night.

113
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:59,575
Lora, you can't still be upset with me.
It been what, a year ?

114
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,800
Yeah.
- Besides, I said I was sorry.

115
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,825
As if sorry makes everything okay, right ?
- That's not fair, Lora.

116
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:07,853
That's not fair either to me,
that's what's not fair.

117
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:10,427
I made a mistake,
what else do you want me to say ?

118
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,661
I think I made a mistake, too.

119
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:22,365
So what's this then,
you're leaving ?

120
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:26,197
I'm afraid so.
- Lora my dear, is everything okay ?

121
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:27,715
I'm fine.

122
00:16:40,256 --> 00:16:44,470
Can't sleep ?
- No.

123
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,612
Can I get you anything ?

124
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:49,252
No.

125
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:53,938
No, thanks hon, I'm fine.

126
00:16:58,614 --> 00:17:02,127
Where is Carolyn?
- In bed.

127
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:04,762
On the phone, of course.

128
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:14,573
How are things with the fundraiser ?

129
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,132
Crazy.

130
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:20,253
But somebody's gotta do it.

131
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:24,780
Just don't overdo it.

132
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,760
Probably you could fine somebody
to help you with that.

133
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,475
You wanna talk?
You work all the time.

134
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:34,914
Besides, I like feeling like I'm
making a difference.

135
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:17,904
This is..

136
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:22,404
Barry, stop.
What's wrong with you ?

137
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,397
Stop it.

138
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,963
God, you won't like it like that.

139
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:40,762
I'm sorry.

140
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:44,388
It's okay, let's just go back to sleep.

141
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:51,950
I'm gonna call Dr. Woods in the morning,
and see if he knows what's wrong with me.

142
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:55,300
You have trouble with your ears again?

143
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:56,561
Yeah.

144
00:18:58,002 --> 00:19:00,667
I think it gets bad lately.

145
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,837
You've been taking your medication?

146
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,338
I miss a couple of doses.

147
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:11,006
Wy would you do that ?

148
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:15,276
The stuff makes me feel like a zombie when I take it.

149
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:17,109
You heard what Dr. Woods said, though?

150
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:21,686
You have to take the medications for six months,
even if you think the ringing stops.

151
00:19:21,686 --> 00:19:23,652
I don't know what.

152
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,891
I know.

153
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,505
Fine.

154
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:33,764
I'll call Dr. Woods in the morning,
and see if he can squeeze you in..

155
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:36,109
..but in the meantime go take your medication.

156
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:39,647
Honey, it's in the car, somewhere,
I'll take it in the morning.

157
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:46,146
Love you.

158
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:29,902
Get your ass over here.

159
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:34,264
What did I tell you playing in your church clothes ?
- I'm sorry daddy.

160
00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:36,779
You're gonna be sorry when I get you home.

161
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:40,611
Didn't I tell you not to encouraged your sister ?

162
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,740
What?

163
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:50,066
What do you want to be when you grow up ?

164
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:55,689
I'm gonna be a dancer.
And I'm gonna dance for thousands of people.

165
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,640
People will give me standing ovation...

166
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,340
..and a handsome gentleman will bring me flowers,
and I'll be famous the world over.

167
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,128
No, you won't.

168
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:08,342
Shut up, Lora.

169
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:11,488
So, what do you wanna be?

170
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:16,762
Nothing, I just wanna leave this place.

171
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,225
Just see what's beyond those streets.
- I wanna go to a big city ..

172
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:22,009
Go to ballet school.

173
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,973
You're too old for that.
- No, I'm not.

174
00:22:24,973 --> 00:22:26,281
You are.

175
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:28,511
You have to start when you were four or five.

176
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:31,535
Well, I'm a quick learner,
I can do it.

177
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:35,131
Great. If we get out of here first.

178
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:39,539
Ashley, I need you to promise me something,
right here, right now.

179
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,824
Promise me that we'll never be separated.

180
00:22:42,824 --> 00:22:46,003
That we'll never be apart,
the only way to leave this place is to stay..

181
00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:48,316
..together.

182
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:54,156
We have to get out of here.

183
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:21,844
I'm Lora, I talked to you on the phone.
- I'm Maggie, I'm a friend of Ashley.

184
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,957
Have you seen her lately?
- I saw her a couple of days ago.

185
00:23:25,957 --> 00:23:30,238
She's supposed to be here this afternoon,
I tried contacting her, but no answer.

186
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:33,258
Look, hey Larry, I'm taking a five minute break!

187
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:39,586
Don't worry.
I'm sure she's fine.

188
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,182
I've known her for about four years.

189
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:45,115
She's a great kid,
she just mae some bad decisions.

190
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:46,890
Have you tried going by her house yet ?

191
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,408
It's a small place about five miles down.

192
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,013
It's the house we grew up in.

193
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:59,997
I just never thought I've to go back to that place again.

194
00:24:01,324 --> 00:24:02,644
No, didn't she..

195
00:24:05,106 --> 00:24:07,337
She's mentioned you a couple of times.

196
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:10,190
Never said you being twins and all.

197
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,672
But, here's some things about Ashley
that I don't reallt know.

198
00:24:14,672 --> 00:24:17,564
Yes, she's always been so secretive.

199
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:20,960
She never told me if anything bad happened to her..

200
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,814
I've just somehow, uh,
I've always known.

201
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:27,495
How long has it been since you two talked
to each other?

202
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:30,049
It's been about six years.

203
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:31,745
But now, that's all that matters.

204
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:35,264
We may think seeing you are what Ashley's
missing right now.

205
00:24:35,264 --> 00:24:37,204
I hope so.

206
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:46,266
Mr. Kane.

207
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:47,995
You can come on back now.

208
00:24:53,972 --> 00:24:56,148
Have a seat right here.

209
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:59,399
The doctor will be with you in just a minute.

210
00:25:12,202 --> 00:25:13,899
Hello Barry.

211
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:17,141
How's the ringing been treating you?

212
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,279
I've decided to give it a name.
- A name?

213
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,341
Since it's not going away,
there's only one thing to do.

214
00:25:24,341 --> 00:25:26,420
I call him 'Maximilian'.

215
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,175
Max for short.

216
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:30,878
And he's missed.

217
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:52,650
I'm gonna get you.
- No, you're not.

218
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:57,453
One...

219
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:21,444
eight, nine, ten.
Ready or not, here I come.

220
00:26:40,854 --> 00:26:44,438
Damn it Ashley, how many times do I have
to tell you not to run back here ?

221
00:26:46,984 --> 00:26:50,351
I'll whoop you're ass right now.
- What happened, daddy ?

222
00:26:50,351 --> 00:26:53,105
Your dumb ass sister was running around,
and bummed her head.

223
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:55,676
Go inside and get the first aid kit.

224
00:26:55,676 --> 00:26:58,204
What the hell are you waiting?
You want her to bleed to death?

225
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,158
Who are you?

226
00:28:23,547 --> 00:28:25,729
Lora.

227
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:31,843
Hello?

228
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,537
Hello?

229
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:49,701
Lora, you must like me.

230
00:28:58,148 --> 00:28:59,656
Lora!

231
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,680
How many more of these bags do
we need stuffing?

232
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,454
Just a few more.

233
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:23,696
So what time is Barry gonna be home ?

234
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:27,368
He'll be here any minute now.

235
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,848
Where is he anyway?
- Doctor's office.

236
00:29:29,848 --> 00:29:33,129
He have a problem with his ears.
- Poor thing.

237
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:37,081
All the problem's he's having with Tinnitus
and the time he spends on the road working.

238
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:40,197
I'm surprised we're still together.

239
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:42,005
What do you mean?

240
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:46,902
Let's just say that things have changed.

241
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:48,425
How?

242
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,753
Hello? Go on.
- I don't know.

243
00:29:52,753 --> 00:29:54,981
It's the little things mostly.

244
00:29:55,415 --> 00:30:00,137
He's not as patient as he used to be,
he seems stressed out about something..

245
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:03,460
Who knows?
Maybe it's just me.

246
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:07,611
But, things don't work out.

247
00:30:09,323 --> 00:30:13,287
How are things in bed?

248
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:18,436
Carolyn, will you please turn down the music ?

249
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:22,112
Now, Carolyn!

250
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:27,610
It sounds like someone could
use a cup of coffee.

251
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:31,707
That wil be great.

252
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:35,718
I'll go and make it.
- No, relax.

253
00:30:35,718 --> 00:30:37,618
I'll make the coffee.

254
00:30:38,372 --> 00:30:40,078
Thank you.

255
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,016
Hello, stranger.

256
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:47,723
Haven't seen you for a while.

257
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:50,547
Looking pretty handsome.

258
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:52,807
How you doing?

259
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:55,070
So, met the doktor?

260
00:30:56,281 --> 00:30:59,689
It's a revelation.
I'm supposed to be taking my medication...

261
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:02,693
See. I told you.

262
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:06,808
Now go upstairs and get dressed,
we have to go to the church in a little over an hour.

263
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:10,632
I know what you're thinking,
and the answer is no.

264
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:15,387
You are going to the church with me,
even if I have to drag you, kicking and screaming.

265
00:31:26,694 --> 00:31:30,344
Mum, i need to go to the pharmacy,
before we're going to church, okay ?

266
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:33,277
Why are you telling this now?
We have to leave in a little over an hour.

267
00:31:33,277 --> 00:31:35,648
I'm just going to get some styff, okay.

268
00:31:35,648 --> 00:31:39,651
Fine. Just go talk to your father,
and see if he can take you, alright ?

269
00:31:49,896 --> 00:31:52,172
I like your chest ?
- Really.

270
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:55,647
I' like everything.

271
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:01,976
Dad?

272
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:08,490
What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

273
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,743
I'm fine.

274
00:32:10,755 --> 00:32:13,394
I need you to take me to the pharmacy,
I need to get some stuff.

275
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:15,218
Sure.

276
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,604
Are you sure you're okay ?
- Honey, I'm fine.

277
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,438
Just go.

278
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,158
How can help you?

279
00:32:25,158 --> 00:32:27,467
I'd like to file a missing person's report.

280
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,309
Name of the missing person?

281
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:40,305
Ashley Gerritsen.

282
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:42,461
Age?
- 25.

283
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:46,776
And when did you first notice that she was missing ?

284
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:48,791
Today, I guess.

285
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,770
You're telling me that she's not
missing for 24hours yet ?

286
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,899
We can't really file a missing person's report..

287
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,689
.. until the person'smissing for 48hours.

288
00:32:57,689 --> 00:32:59,712
I can't get hold of her, I've called her,
been to her house..

289
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:03,848
.. been to the place she works, nothing.
- But that doesn't necessarily means she's missing.

290
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,600
Aand if she doesn't show up for work tomorrow,
and you still can't find her..

291
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,142
then you can come here and report.

292
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:25,756
Sorry, dad.
- Honey, I'm sorry...

293
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:29,503
There's this ringing in my ear,
it stops and it'll be back tomorrow.

294
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:32,684
Do you think mom will let me go to Jen's
party tomorrow ?

295
00:33:33,218 --> 00:33:34,494
I don't know.

296
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:38,697
You went to Jennifer's house last week,
and weren't you supposed to be back by 10?

297
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:41,904
But that's not fair, because Jen's parents were
supposed to take me home..

298
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:43,511
.. and they didn't come home until late.

299
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:48,041
Yes, but you didn't tell us that Jen's parents were
gonna be there.

300
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:50,105
Or we would have let you go.
- Fine.

301
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:53,720
Can we just tell mom about this tomorrow ?

302
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:16,117
Light's green.
- Sorry.

303
00:34:18,718 --> 00:34:20,884
Dad, I think you need some help.

304
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:24,910
No, it's just been a long week.

305
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:36,624
Hey, did she show up yet?
- Afraid not, sweetheart.

306
00:34:36,624 --> 00:34:39,333
And boy, Larry is pissed.
And if she doesn't show up soon..

307
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,923
.. he said he's gonna fire her.
Did you try her house ?

308
00:34:41,923 --> 00:34:46,046
Yeah, I went there, and then I went to the police station,
trying to file a missing person's report.

309
00:34:46,046 --> 00:34:48,975
They said there's not enough time passed,
and that there's nothing they can do.

310
00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:54,021
Ashley is gonna be fine, like I said before,
sometimes she just blew everything off.

311
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:57,035
In fact she just broke up with Peter
a couple of days ago.

312
00:34:57,447 --> 00:35:00,782
Who's Peter?
- Her old boyfriend, he's a real loser.

313
00:35:02,531 --> 00:35:05,709
Do you know where this guy Peter lives?
Maybe she's over there.

314
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:07,555
I sure hope not.

315
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:11,566
Let's give it a try.
He lives in a trailer park four miles down the road.

316
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:15,513
Town and Countty.
It's an old trailer in the back.

317
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,505
It's a piece of shit, can't miss it.

318
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,192
He's here two days ago.

319
00:37:20,275 --> 00:37:22,112
Help me.

320
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,860
Help me.

321
00:37:31,631 --> 00:37:34,038
Help me.

322
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:53,896
B9.

323
00:37:55,598 --> 00:37:59,564
I know. It's just gonna a little bit longer.
We got plenty of prizes to give away.

324
00:38:05,803 --> 00:38:07,968
It's okay.

325
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:30,830
Lora, is there something wrong?

326
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:48,162
Lora, is there something wrong?

327
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:50,450
Something wrong with Ashley?

328
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,843
Yes, there is.

329
00:38:53,843 --> 00:38:57,050
You want me to call your father?
- No.

330
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,596
Please don't call my father.
- No, it's okay.

331
00:38:59,596 --> 00:39:02,100
I won't call him if you don't want me to.

332
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:09,740
Lora, I can't help you if you don't
tell me what's wrong.

333
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,213
There's nothing you can do.

334
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:16,646
What did you say?

335
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:19,337
I'm going to kill him.

336
00:39:19,836 --> 00:39:22,640
Papa, leave her alone, please.
- Get out of here.

337
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,103
You're hurting her.
- Go, now.

338
00:39:24,103 --> 00:39:25,709
Don't hurt her, please.

339
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:33,769
No.

340
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:36,409
No.

341
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:03,192
O52.
- Bingo.

342
00:40:16,768 --> 00:40:18,537
Hello?

343
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,718
Hello?
- Come in.

344
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:26,238
Hello there, can I help you ?

345
00:40:26,238 --> 00:40:28,794
Is Father Lay still around ?

346
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:32,143
I used to come here when I was a little girl.
- Of course he's till here.

347
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:36,014
In fact, he's in the back right now.
I'll go and get him.

348
00:40:36,014 --> 00:40:37,691
Thank you very much.

349
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:52,525
Hey, the gambling thing.
Watch the gambling thing.

350
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:54,852
Sorry, Father.
Lora Gerritsen is here to see you.

351
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,464
It's great.

352
00:40:58,576 --> 00:41:04,137
Abby, i'm gonna skip outside and
get some lemonade.

353
00:41:04,137 --> 00:41:06,429
That sounds good, can you get me some too, please ?

354
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:21,868
Thanks for coming.

355
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:37,600
How's the bingo going?

356
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,502
Pretty good, Father.
Abby seems to be on top of things.

357
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:42,477
I have somebody here I'd like you to meet.

358
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:46,179
This young lady used to be one of our
parishioners.

359
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:56,734
That was odd.

360
00:41:56,734 --> 00:41:58,594
Is he okay?

361
00:41:58,594 --> 00:42:00,248
He's just probably having problem with his ears.

362
00:42:00,248 --> 00:42:03,776
He's had Tinnitus. Ringing in the ears.
Pretty awful.

363
00:42:11,244 --> 00:42:13,253
Daddy, what is wrong with you?

364
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,035
I22.

365
00:42:20,088 --> 00:42:22,782
Barry, what's wrong? You seem like you've seen a ghost.

366
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:25,925
Can Vivian take you home ?
I gotta get out of here.

367
00:42:26,822 --> 00:42:29,742
We just got here.
- I don't feel well, okay.

368
00:42:29,742 --> 00:42:32,514
I just need to leave.
- Go.

369
00:42:32,514 --> 00:42:34,485
Just go. I'll see you at home tonight.

370
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:52,880
We knew everything that ever happened
around this place.

371
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,358
Well it's true. You met today,
well it's new.

372
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:03,943
Coming back through this evening.
What time do you get off ?

373
00:43:03,943 --> 00:43:06,287
You don't waste any time, do you?

374
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:07,822
Hold on a moment.

375
00:45:07,822 --> 00:45:10,180
Just a second, honey, let me open the door for you.

376
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:17,369
Hello, sweety. Lord, it's raining cats and dogs
out there.

377
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:19,594
Yeah, I need a room.

378
00:45:19,594 --> 00:45:21,512
Alright. Hold on one second.

379
00:45:24,903 --> 00:45:27,212
We ust clean this up this morning.
- Thanks.

380
00:45:27,212 --> 00:45:30,342
Thank you.
You have a nice evening there.

381
00:48:24,415 --> 00:48:26,126
You need a help?

382
00:48:26,126 --> 00:48:28,346
I'll be right there.

383
00:48:28,346 --> 00:48:30,680
I shouldn't have been there.

384
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,458
What took you so long ?

385
00:48:37,458 --> 00:48:40,879
Here we go again.

386
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:42,794
Barry, here's somebody I'd like you to meet.

387
00:50:42,794 --> 00:50:46,130
He's just having a problem with his ears.
He has Tinnitus.

388
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,342
Pretty awful.

389
00:50:55,213 --> 00:50:57,702
I'll be back in 24hrs, okay?

390
00:50:57,702 --> 00:51:00,850
Barry, you okay?
- I'm alright, I'm fine, just don't worry.

391
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:04,218
Are you sure? You seem really stressed out.
Your ears bothering you?

392
00:51:04,218 --> 00:51:06,950
Does everything have to be about my ears, Abby?

393
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,786
If this happens, if that happens, it's Barry's ear, right ?

394
00:51:09,786 --> 00:51:12,369
Why are you yelling at me?
What did I do.

395
00:51:16,485 --> 00:51:19,027
I'm sorry.

396
00:51:19,027 --> 00:51:23,103
I'm really sorry.
I'm just stressed out.

397
00:51:23,103 --> 00:51:26,724
Chris is going to Miami, there's many things
I have to do before I can go.

398
00:51:26,724 --> 00:51:30,230
Honey, it's okay.

399
00:51:31,412 --> 00:51:34,222
It's my fault. I shouldn't be putting so much
on your plate.

400
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:39,864
No it;s not your fault, I'm just being an asshole.

401
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:42,235
You are not being an asshole.

402
00:51:43,718 --> 00:51:46,303
You're a good man.

403
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:50,888
I love you.
-  I love you too.

404
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:05,733
Understand me ?

405
00:52:05,733 --> 00:52:11,522
Make sure everything's nice and clean over here, alright.

406
00:52:21,523 --> 00:52:24,453
Miss Gerritsen, we will need you to come down to
the police station to ask a few questions.

407
00:52:31,141 --> 00:52:33,301
Sorry, miss.

408
00:52:56,066 --> 00:52:58,463
Miss. Gerritsen, is there anything we can get you?

409
00:53:00,425 --> 00:53:04,100
I've been here for three hours.
When can I leave?

410
00:53:05,146 --> 00:53:05,866
Sorry.

411
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:16,756
Miss Gerritsen.

412
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:22,218
We spoke to some people at the
'Mickey's Diner' about your visit yesterday.

413
00:53:22,218 --> 00:53:25,037
Obviously you're looking for your sister.

414
00:53:25,037 --> 00:53:27,650
And we do know you came by..

415
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,959
..to file on a missing person's report yesterday.

416
00:53:31,145 --> 00:53:35,207
And it appeared that we may have found your sister.

417
00:53:36,411 --> 00:53:39,711
I knew she was in trouble.
It's always been like that.

418
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,108
That twin's communication thing, right ?

419
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,023
Our forensics people have indicated that you..

420
00:53:45,023 --> 00:53:47,382
.. that your sister must have been dead
for at least two days.

421
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:50,182
There's no physical way that you could have
know anything about this.

422
00:53:50,182 --> 00:53:52,895
You think I had something to do with this?

423
00:53:53,992 --> 00:53:56,313
Nobody's accusing you of anything
right now, but..

424
00:53:56,313 --> 00:53:59,302
.. it is a very strange situation,
don't you think ?

425
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,497
I'm through joking with you.

426
00:54:04,497 --> 00:54:06,801
You wanna keep me here,
you better charge me with something..

427
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:08,565
.. and let me speak to my attorney.

428
00:54:08,565 --> 00:54:10,462
I don't think that will be necessary.

429
00:54:10,462 --> 00:54:14,487
Just a couple more routine questions,
and you'll be free to go.

430
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:18,564
You know of anybody that might wanna
hurt your sister ?

431
00:54:18,564 --> 00:54:19,976
Ex boyfriend?
- No.

432
00:54:19,976 --> 00:54:21,616
Enemies?
- No.

433
00:54:21,616 --> 00:54:23,638
Co-workers?
- No, no one, okay ?

434
00:54:26,173 --> 00:54:28,761
Alright, you're free to go.

435
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,801
Don't leave town anytime soon.

436
00:54:35,787 --> 00:54:37,809
When can I bury her?

437
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:39,655
I'll get back with you.

438
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,690
Bobby's coming over tonight.
- What do you mean he's coming?

439
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:04,215
He wants to see me, in the backyard.

440
00:55:04,215 --> 00:55:06,734
You're crazy. Dad will find out,
he'll kill you.

441
00:55:06,734 --> 00:55:08,821
To hell with him.

442
00:55:10,061 --> 00:55:11,979
I'm jealous.
- I know you are.

443
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:08,905
What is this?
- It's chicken and soup, daddy.

444
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:12,194
Taste like shit, that's what it is.
- Then don't eat it.

445
00:56:12,194 --> 00:56:15,364
What did you say?
I ask you a question, girl.

446
00:56:15,364 --> 00:56:18,312
Leave her alone, dad.
I'll make you something else.

447
00:56:18,756 --> 00:56:19,756
No.

448
00:56:21,196 --> 00:56:24,806
Look what I did to you.
- I hope you die and go in hell.

449
00:56:29,244 --> 00:56:33,145


450
00:56:59,184 --> 00:57:00,838
Where is my tea ?

451
00:57:02,955 --> 00:57:05,141
You're finally here.

452
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:07,371
You're slow.

453
00:57:07,371 --> 00:57:09,899
Just like your mother.

454
00:57:18,937 --> 00:57:21,673
Get out of here.

455
00:57:33,724 --> 00:57:36,311
Where is my tea ?

456
00:57:40,418 --> 00:57:43,285
Lora, what are you crazy ?

457
00:58:14,919 --> 00:58:17,532
It's so good to see you again,
my child.

458
00:58:17,532 --> 00:58:20,132
Is Father Lay around ?
- I'm afraid not, he's ..

459
00:58:20,132 --> 00:58:23,578
He's in town, running some errands right now,
you're welcome to come in and wait for him.

460
00:58:23,578 --> 00:58:25,801
Actually I can't.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

461
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:29,014
I need to get hold to somebody he introduced
to me yesterday.

462
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,909
Kind of a tall gentleman..

463
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,903
He wore these earplugs.

464
00:58:34,903 --> 00:58:36,742
You mean Barry.

465
00:58:36,742 --> 00:58:40,743
He's wonderful. His wife, Abby,
has been wonderful to us.

466
00:58:40,743 --> 00:58:43,452
I was supposed to get to know his wife, before, I uh..

467
00:58:43,452 --> 00:58:46,336
somehow managed to misplace her number.

468
00:58:46,336 --> 00:58:48,154
I have it.
I'll get it for you.

469
00:59:40,294 --> 00:59:43,922
Mom,somebody left this for dad.
Alright, I'll see you later.

470
01:00:50,433 --> 01:00:52,507
Morning.

471
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,698
Is everything okay?

472
01:00:55,698 --> 01:00:58,065
Somebody left that for you,
at the front doorstep.

473
01:00:58,065 --> 01:01:01,248
Strange.
- It sure is.

474
01:01:02,064 --> 01:01:02,814
Yeah.

475
01:01:05,156 --> 01:01:09,041
Thanks for opening it.
- Believe me, I wish I hadn't.

476
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:12,255
<i>You left this</i>

477
01:01:16,634 --> 01:01:18,834
<i>You left this</i>

478
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:22,759
Honey, those looks just like the earplugs that you wear.

479
01:01:26,702 --> 01:01:30,426
Is there something that I should know
- No, it's just ...

480
01:01:30,426 --> 01:01:34,831
It was just a practical joke.
One of the guys at work.

481
01:01:34,831 --> 01:01:37,108
Some joke ?

482
01:01:37,108 --> 01:01:42,265
He drove all the way here, to leave you a note, right ?

483
01:01:43,181 --> 01:01:48,793
Yeah, just throw it away.

484
01:01:54,733 --> 01:01:57,970
Don't worry, it's a bad joke.

485
01:03:32,644 --> 01:03:35,134
Daddy, are you okay ?

486
01:03:35,134 --> 01:03:39,089
Mom left so that I have to take care of you alone.

487
01:03:39,089 --> 01:03:41,784
Mom died in a car accident.
She loved us.

488
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:45,550
She didn't love you, She loved Ashley,
she loves drinking..

489
01:03:48,093 --> 01:03:50,574
She loved us.

490
01:04:27,935 --> 01:04:30,181
What was it ?

491
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:39,007
<i>How can you sleep after what you did to me?</i>

492
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:41,678
<i> You sick person.</i>

493
01:04:44,223 --> 01:04:46,657
It's my office.

494
01:04:46,657 --> 01:04:49,277
He calls you in the morning,
who is he ?

495
01:04:54,467 --> 01:04:56,622
Who is this?
Why are you calling me ?

496
01:04:56,622 --> 01:04:58,873
Who do you think this is, Barry?

497
01:04:58,873 --> 01:05:02,675
I don't know.
Why are you calling me ?

498
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:06,754
<i>You tried to kill me, you sick.</i>

499
01:05:06,754 --> 01:05:10,088
<i>Guess what, I'm back.</i>

500
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:18,021
It can't be.

501
01:05:31,624 --> 01:05:33,686
Come on.

502
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:36,610
Come on.

503
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:43,123
Stop. 

504
01:05:43,618 --> 01:05:46,616
Stop. 

505
01:06:07,419 --> 01:06:12,173
No, it can't be.
Get up.

506
01:06:14,521 --> 01:06:15,521
No.

507
01:07:26,503 --> 01:07:29,425
I'm so sorry about Ashley.

508
01:07:30,134 --> 01:07:32,390
I still can't believe she's dead.

509
01:07:33,504 --> 01:07:36,801
When I found Ashley's body..

510
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:38,870
I found this.

511
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:42,209
I know who killed her.
His name is Barry Kane.

512
01:07:42,209 --> 01:07:44,778
How do you know it's him ?
- Because when he saw me..

513
01:07:44,778 --> 01:07:46,367
..he freaked out, like he has seen me before.

514
01:07:46,367 --> 01:07:49,860
And there's something wrong with his ears,
that's why he is wearing those earplugs.

515
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:53,478
He's been to the Diner a few times,
and he seems to be interested in Ashley.

516
01:07:53,478 --> 01:07:57,003
And if I'm not mistaken,
he was at the Diner the last time she worked.

517
01:07:57,003 --> 01:07:59,233
We need to go to the police ?
- And tell them what ?

518
01:07:59,233 --> 01:08:01,704
We don't have any proofs.
- Then what are you gonna do ?

519
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:04,109
I'm gonna do what needs to be done.

520
01:08:24,129 --> 01:08:26,489
<i>Hi, can I speak to Barry Kane please?</i>

521
01:08:26,489 --> 01:08:29,045
He's in the shower.
Can I take a message ?

522
01:08:29,045 --> 01:08:31,507
<i>Sure, this is Ashley, i'm the waitress at Mickey's...</i>

523
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,519
<i>he left his jacket here a couple
of days ago.</i>

524
01:08:33,519 --> 01:08:37,548
<i>Just let him know that he can come by and
pick it up anytime he wants.</i>

525
01:08:38,486 --> 01:08:40,413
Okay, thank you.

526
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,738
Some girl named Ashley,
in a place called Mickey's ..

527
01:08:47,738 --> 01:08:51,517
called to tell to tell that you left your jacket
ac ouple of days ago..

528
01:08:51,517 --> 01:08:53,245
..and youcan go and pick it up.

529
01:08:53,245 --> 01:08:57,470
That was nice of her.

530
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:00,979
I'll grab it on my way out of town.
- Honey, what's going on ?

531
01:09:00,979 --> 01:09:03,565
What ?
Everything's fine.

532
01:09:03,565 --> 01:09:05,687
Who called you last night ?

533
01:09:07,942 --> 01:09:09,601
Co-workers.
- At two o'clock in the morning ?

534
01:09:09,601 --> 01:09:12,360
Our plans have changed. I've got to go to Tampa
instead of Miami.

535
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,876
I gotta go.
I'll call you from the hotel.

536
01:09:33,444 --> 01:09:35,982
Just you today ?

537
01:09:35,982 --> 01:09:39,240
Yeah, I was just wondering if Ashley's
working today ?

538
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,872
She doesn't come until tonight.

539
01:09:55,946 --> 01:09:58,480
Lora, you're not gonna believe
who just came to the Diner.

540
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,854
<i>What happened ?
- I went over to see, then..</i>

541
01:10:00,854 --> 01:10:02,559
<i>he asked if Ashley's was working.</i>

542
01:10:02,559 --> 01:10:05,122
What did you tell him?
- Well, I didn't know what to say.

543
01:10:05,122 --> 01:10:07,754
I told Ashley would be working later tonight.

544
01:10:08,198 --> 01:10:10,147
Okay, Maggie...

545
01:10:10,147 --> 01:10:11,824
I have a plan.

546
01:10:12,203 --> 01:10:14,561
And I'm gonna need your help.

547
01:10:23,527 --> 01:10:25,856
<i>I like your chest.</i>

548
01:11:11,886 --> 01:11:15,082
How many tonight ?
- Just one.

549
01:11:20,062 --> 01:11:22,856
Your serving will be here in just a minute.

550
01:11:38,772 --> 01:11:40,408
Hello, Barry.

551
01:11:47,714 --> 01:11:49,354
You're alive.

552
01:11:55,046 --> 01:11:56,697
Ashley...

553
01:11:57,267 --> 01:11:59,667
Sorry, I ..

554
01:11:59,667 --> 01:12:01,535
I didn't know what to do.

555
01:12:02,223 --> 01:12:04,533
Look, if we can go somewhere and talk..

556
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:07,371
.. I can explain.
- Okay.

557
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:11,797
I'll pick you up here.
- No.

558
01:12:11,797 --> 01:12:13,906
I'll meet you there.

559
01:12:14,693 --> 01:12:17,644
Where?
- Don't you remember?

560
01:12:18,757 --> 01:12:20,854
Th e place where you left me.

561
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:23,464
Not now.

562
01:12:38,211 --> 01:12:41,766
How do I look ?
- You look just like her.

563
01:12:42,272 --> 01:12:45,671
Are you sure you're gonna go through with this ?
- I have to.

564
01:12:45,671 --> 01:12:47,276
Alright.

565
01:12:49,137 --> 01:12:51,492
It's showtime.
Oh, wait.

566
01:12:58,384 --> 01:12:59,856
What is this ?

567
01:12:59,856 --> 01:13:03,813
I know I can't stop you, but take this,
just in case ..

568
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,235
Take it.

569
01:13:43,648 --> 01:13:46,180
Barry, does your wife know ?

570
01:13:46,984 --> 01:13:49,976
I bet she wouldn't like that, now, would she, huh ?

571
01:13:51,285 --> 01:13:53,861
How'd it feel, Barry?

572
01:13:54,606 --> 01:13:58,241
How'd it feel to lose it all ?
To lose your family, to lose everything.

573
01:13:58,241 --> 01:14:02,154
How does that feel ?
- Enough of this, where are you ?

574
01:14:09,474 --> 01:14:11,763
Get up !

575
01:14:11,763 --> 01:14:14,251
Get up !

576
01:14:14,251 --> 01:14:16,793
I said, Get up !

577
01:14:18,735 --> 01:14:19,485
Now!

578
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:22,739
It can't be you, I ..

579
01:14:23,303 --> 01:14:26,770
You threw me in the river ?
You thought I was dead ?

580
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:28,593
Is that what you thought ?

581
01:14:31,445 --> 01:14:34,238
You're not alive !

582
01:14:35,835 --> 01:14:38,836
You need to be dead !

583
01:14:38,836 --> 01:14:41,292
I said, Get the fuck off !

584
01:15:55,388 --> 01:15:59,758
Why are you doing this to me ?
I never meant to hurt you, I swear.

585
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:03,029
I thought you were dead.
- Let go !

586
01:16:03,029 --> 01:16:05,418
I didn't know what else to do !

587
01:16:08,392 --> 01:16:10,972
I thought you were dead !

588
01:16:16,051 --> 01:16:17,051
No!

589
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,768
Why couldn't you leave me alone ?
