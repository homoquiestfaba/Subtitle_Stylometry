1
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:11,656
I wish I could tell you that

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:14,665
all this shit never really happened.

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,010
And it was all a figment of my...

4
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:28,978
active imagination or just some weird dream.

5
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:36,093
I wish.

6
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:45,180
Yeah, that's me.

7
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:51,534
I'm wearing my sky blue shirt
today, must be Wednesday.

8
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:55,551
Holy shit.

9
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,331
I don't even know the first thing

10
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:03,501
about this woman but she now represents

11
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:06,761
everything that's missing from my life.

12
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,860
I wonder what she looks like naked.

13
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:21,245
If she asks me to get off at the next stop

14
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:24,189
and run away with her
to some deserted island

15
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:27,884
where I could watch here
frolic butt naked in the sand,

16
00:01:27,894 --> 00:01:31,644
well I'd have to think
long and hard about it

17
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:36,014
before I remembered I already
have a wife I'm stuck with.

18
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,877
And there she is everyone,
the love of my life,

19
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:43,804
the yin to my yang, my wife Carrie.

20
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,973
We married right out of college.

21
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:48,109
Seven years later I feel like

22
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,869
I'm living with a total stranger.

23
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,037
It's not that I hate her,

24
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,130
I just don't like anything about her.

25
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,018
The way it takes her forever

26
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:01,695
to pay at the check out counter.

27
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:04,201
I'm sorry I...

28
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:06,701
I can pay with a card Carrie if you want.

29
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:07,544
No.

30
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:09,005
Oh God her laugh,

31
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:11,127
its so fucking terrible, it's so bad.

32
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,701
Basically I just don't like the way

33
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:18,893
she doesn't understand me at all.

34
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:19,903
Hey.

35
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:22,095
Hey.

36
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:25,947
I thought basketball season was over.

37
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:28,061
It it's this is the ESPN classics.

38
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:31,321
So this is like an old game?

39
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:32,463
Yeah.

40
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,491
Seriously, you're watching
a game that already happened?

41
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:38,541
What the fuck is the point of that?

42
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,384
It's game six in the '98 finals.

43
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:46,256
Michael Jordan, six
championships, how do you?

44
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:50,131
You're pathetic.

45
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,986
Love you.

46
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:57,110
This is my boss, Janet.

47
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,652
She's a total fucking bitch.

48
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:01,695
Look at her.

49
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,037
Does that make sense to you?

50
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:03,870
I can't believe

51
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,704
I wanted to fuck this woman.

52
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:06,143
'Cause it seems like it
doesn't make sense to you.

53
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,479
I mean it makes sense to me, but I'm smart.

54
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,408
Now I wish nothing more

55
00:03:09,418 --> 00:03:10,811
than to duct tape her mouth shut

56
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:12,287
and shove her lifeless body into frozen

57
00:03:12,297 --> 00:03:15,547
Lake Michigan in the middle of January.

58
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:18,129
Is that bad?

59
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:19,472
It won't happen again.

60
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,551
I hate my job.

61
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:23,981
I hate everything about it but most of all

62
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:27,991
I hate all the stupid
assholes that I work with.

63
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:32,031
I hate the dumb chit chat from Mark,

64
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,603
the charisma sucking dipshit lazy ass

65
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,138
who stands at the edge of my cubicle

66
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:38,703
for 20 minutes at a time instructing me

67
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:40,702
to watch these dumb ass YouTube videos

68
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:42,591
of the cat parties he throws.

69
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:43,759
You look at that Samson.

70
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,352
He's a little shy guy isn't he?

71
00:03:46,537 --> 00:03:47,361
Three five two one.

72
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:48,494
And so I was getting down there.

73
00:03:48,504 --> 00:03:50,111
And Molly, who constantly

74
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:54,141
describes every sorted detail
of her sexual exploits.

75
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,127
And he asks me, hey
you wanna get real weird?

76
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:59,261
And you know me man, I'm
down for anything bro.

77
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:00,176
I mean the stuff

78
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:01,501
that comes out of this woman's mouth.

79
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:04,594
He pulled out a butt plug you know.

80
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:07,951
And I'm talking it was
a massive butt plug bro.

81
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:08,861
It'll haunt your dreams.

82
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:11,999
It was giant, we had a real weekend of it.

83
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:13,926
That's awesome Molly.

84
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,663
But worst of all is the stupid parties

85
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:20,335
these people have for the
most minute occasions.

86
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:22,399
I mean you've seen my
vanilla kind of cupcake.

87
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:23,567
This one is a going away party

88
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:27,410
for Betsy, our temporary
department assistant.

89
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:30,396
No people usually cook for me actually.

90
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:31,230
We've had seven different

91
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,487
temps this year, and seven
different parties for

92
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:35,919
each and every one of these fuckers.

93
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:37,839
They must send those guys to like

94
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:40,287
some kind of school or something you know.

95
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:44,297
They just work at the
grocery store like if you.

96
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:50,415
Awe see that's good, that's good.

97
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:51,815
Like I don't know if it's psychosomatic,

98
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,319
but I taste blueberries.

99
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,199
Really.

100
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:55,351
Blue, right.

101
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,372
At some point I made up

102
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:58,711
a phony digestive disorder just so

103
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:02,888
I could get away from my cubicle
without being questioned.

104
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:06,981
I spend a lot of time in here.

105
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,855
Carrie always suggest that we meet up

106
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:13,782
and hang out at trendy restaurants.

107
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:15,751
It makes her feel like she's in

108
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:19,344
some Meg Ryan romantic comedy or something.

109
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:21,894
I don't get it.

110
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:26,551
Since we don't ever have
anything to talk about

111
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:29,894
I just find our little dates depressing.

112
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:45,705
Carrie has the worst taste in books.

113
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:47,911
She only reads trendy shit that's been

114
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:50,151
on the best seller list
forever but she still has

115
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:53,661
the audacity to believe that she's unique.

116
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:01,585
Riley we need to talk.

117
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:02,889
Okay.

118
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:06,282
This is going to be hard.

119
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:07,719
What?

120
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:10,647
Oh God, she's putting on

121
00:06:10,657 --> 00:06:13,407
her best Meryl Streep impression.

122
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:16,247
She usually only does
this when someone dies,

123
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:20,039
or her favorite singer gets
kicked of of American Idol.

124
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:21,382
I met someone.

125
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:25,447
What does that mean?

126
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:29,624
It means I met someone else
and I think I want a divorce.

127
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:32,839
Are you breaking up
with me at a restaurant?

128
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:34,775
I'm not trying to intentionally hurt you.

129
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:36,868
It just sort of happened.

130
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:38,984
Who is he?

131
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:40,119
It doesn't matter who he is.

132
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:43,335
Of course it matters,
what are you talking about?

133
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:44,935
Just someone I met at work.

134
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:47,575
At work, are you fucking kidding me?

135
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:49,399
Calm down people are staring.

136
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,859
I don't give a shit,
what are you looking at?

137
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,804
- Riley get a hold of yourself
- Chicken fingers?

138
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:54,146
How old are you?

139
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:55,429
Enough.

140
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:00,755
Let me guess, Tony, seen
the way he looks at you.

141
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:02,130
The guy practically fucks you in his mind.

142
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,187
It's not Tony.

143
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:04,083
Ryan?

144
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:05,093
Ew, no.

145
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:07,668
Don't tell me it's Jeff.

146
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:12,219
Seriously?

147
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:16,204
The guy smells like a sweaty
nut sack all the time.

148
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:17,450
That's because he's a personal trainer

149
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,692
and he sweats for a living.

150
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:20,573
You're pathetic.

151
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,832
I'm pathetic?

152
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:26,092
So when you said for better or worse,

153
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:27,580
what you really meant was until someone

154
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,673
you could fuck with better
abs comes along right?

155
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,257
I can't believe I wasted seven
years of my life with you.

156
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:43,264
You know I wasn't enjoying this either.

157
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:44,257
But I made it work 'cause that's

158
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:46,160
what grown ups are supposed to do.

159
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,253
This isn't easy for me.

160
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:49,585
What's that I can't hear you

161
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,350
with Jeff's three inch dick in your mouth.

162
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,072
I know that you're upset
but focusing on the negatives

163
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:57,952
is not going to get us
through this situation.

164
00:07:57,962 --> 00:08:00,048
Spare me your psych major bullshit okay.

165
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:01,536
You flunked out of college remember.

166
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:04,510
You know I had to drop
out because I had mono.

167
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,393
You had the flu.

168
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:09,485
No it was really bad
mono, even my doctor said.

169
00:08:09,882 --> 00:08:11,049
God.

170
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:15,295
Dr. Phil says...

171
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:16,400
Oh Jesus Christ.

172
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,520
That you should live
the life that you love.

173
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,896
And he and his wife have been married

174
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:22,176
for a really long time and I think

175
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:25,004
that he knows what he's talking about.

176
00:08:25,014 --> 00:08:29,181
And you know that this hasn't
been good for a long time.

177
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:30,556
Yeah no shit.

178
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:34,625
Why don't you just take the apartment

179
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:36,878
to yourself for the next couple of days.

180
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:40,178
Oh thank you Carrie,
that's real nice of you.

181
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:43,771
What do you want me to do Riley?

182
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,266
So what you'd thought you'd bring me

183
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,846
to a public place, I
wouldn't cause a scene.

184
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:52,981
Well we both know how emotional you are.

185
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,815
And I figured maybe you wouldn't

186
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,574
say something that you regretted.

187
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,630
Excuse me everybody.

188
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,550
Riley sit down.

189
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,393
Everyone, this woman is a whore.

190
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:06,047
Riley, oh my God.

191
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:08,790
A dirty, dirty whore.

192
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,830
Just thought you all should know.

193
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,757
Really really mature.

194
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,774
Enjoy your life with Jeff McSweaty Balls.

195
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:18,102
And sorry for insulting you
about your chicken nuggets,

196
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:20,779
I love chicken nuggets, fuck it.

197
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,779
Hi how can I help you?

198
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:28,158
Yeah I need to talk to Jeff.

199
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,982
Is he expecting you?

200
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:32,878
Doubtful, can you just go get him please?

201
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:34,174
Well I can't just go and get him

202
00:09:34,184 --> 00:09:35,695
if he's not expecting you.

203
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:36,956
Just go get Jeff will you?

204
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,571
Well you need to calm down
before I can go and get Jeff.

205
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:40,414
Riley what's up man?

206
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,381
Don't do that.

207
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:43,552
Do what?

208
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:46,164
We need to talk.

209
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:02,796
Riley what's going on buddy?

210
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:08,868
She's all yours.

211
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:20,048
Even though my marriage

212
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:22,307
only ended a few hours ago,

213
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:26,141
it's weird to be back in our house.

214
00:10:29,688 --> 00:10:31,105
I'm not sure why.

215
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:32,750
I mean I know I haven't
been in love with her

216
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,477
for a long time but thinking about how

217
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:38,654
I've wasted years of my
life with the wrong person

218
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:43,495
makes me very angry.

219
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:48,435
Bitch, fucking bitch.

220
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Fuck you!

221
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:51,302
There have only been

222
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:52,742
two moments in my life where I have gotten

223
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,085
so angry that I momentarily blacked out.

224
00:10:57,092 --> 00:10:58,922
The first time beating up Cory Henderson

225
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:03,099
in the fourth grade because
he called me a homo, and this.

226
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:10,342
Awe, Carrie's favorite pillow,

227
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,646
I think there's a little tear in it.

228
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:16,156
Let me go ahead and fix that, there we go.

229
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:20,766
That's nice.

230
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,680
Riley.

231
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:30,782
Yo, Riley.

232
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:33,286
What?

233
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:36,419
You okay man, you look like shit.

234
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:38,996
What do you want?

235
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:41,140
Janet wants to see you in her office.

236
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,733
Oh and FYI, the beast is angry.

237
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,123
Good job on the White Shirt Wednesday.

238
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,383
Alright Mark.

239
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:01,249
It happened again.

240
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,096
What happened again?

241
00:12:05,106 --> 00:12:08,231
Another mistake you should of caught.

242
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:09,241
Okay.

243
00:12:10,574 --> 00:12:11,574
Okay?

244
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,600
What do you want me to say Janet?

245
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,536
I want you to explain to me why

246
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:19,463
we keep having these conversations.

247
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,816
I don't have an explanation for you okay.

248
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,659
It was a mistake, mistakes happen.

249
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:28,680
That's why they call them mistakes.

250
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,120
Not on my watch they don't.

251
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,880
Apparently they do.

252
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,002
Excuse me?

253
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:35,548
I said apparently they do.

254
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:39,390
Listen, I don't know what's

255
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,067
going on in your life right now.

256
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:45,518
Whether you're having
family or personal problems,

257
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:47,611
and frankly I don't care.

258
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:50,270
When you're here I expect you to

259
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,750
be focused and committed to your work.

260
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,022
Now if this is something you can't handle

261
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:56,286
then maybe you should think about

262
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:59,046
getting a different line of work.

263
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:08,111
You know Janet, for once
I actually agree with you.

264
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:14,221
What does that mean?

265
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,707
It means I fucking quit, yeah.

266
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:25,450
That's seriously what you want?

267
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,543
Yes it is, more than
anything in the world yes.

268
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:32,862
Well maybe you should take a minute

269
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:36,011
and use your brain and talk this through.

270
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:38,938
No no no, I'm done talking, yeah.

271
00:13:49,464 --> 00:13:52,547
Oh and feel free to go fuck yourself.

272
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,945
After Carrie saw

273
00:14:08,955 --> 00:14:10,626
how I trashed the apartment she stuck

274
00:14:10,636 --> 00:14:12,306
a restraining order on me and demanded

275
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:15,149
I move out by the end of the week.

276
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:18,677
Can't say I blame her.

277
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:24,546
There's something sad about seeing a place

278
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:28,723
you've lived in for awhile
knowing it will be the last time.

279
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:35,419
No, no no no, no.

280
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,498
Hey you looking for that van?

281
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:46,210
Yeah what, did you see what happened to it?

282
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,144
Yeah some guy hopped in
the front seat and took off.

283
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:52,571
Why didn't you do anything?

284
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:54,629
Wasn't my truck.

285
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:58,723
Are you fucking serious?

286
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:07,152
Of course, how could my piece
of shit life get any worse?

287
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:13,093
Everything I own was in that fucking van.

288
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,797
You want to call the cops or something?

289
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:22,899
God.

290
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:26,466
A moment of panic kicks in

291
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:29,938
when you realize you've lost
every possession you own,

292
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:34,098
but for me it was quickly
replaced by a calming rush.

293
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:36,691
Everything in my life was gone.

294
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:38,213
Can I bum a smoke?

295
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:39,700
But for some reason,

296
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,543
Yeah.

297
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:43,425
I didn't care.

298
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:54,406
Do you want to report the van stolen or?

299
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,416
Fuck it.

300
00:16:01,312 --> 00:16:02,729
Just stuff right?

301
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Right.

302
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:11,581
Thanks for the smoke.

303
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,534
Hey man what about your box?

304
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,044
Keep it.

305
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:17,135
Hey man come here!

306
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:19,984
What?

307
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,290
Yeah man come here!

308
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:25,296
Come here!

309
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:36,030
What?

310
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,895
You got a light?

311
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:38,190
Light no no, you shouldn't,

312
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,878
school property you shouldn't smoke here.

313
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:43,138
Hey man what's your name?

314
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:44,509
Riley.

315
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:46,048
Riley?

316
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,153
What kind of fucking name is that?

317
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:52,460
I don't know a regular one.

318
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,262
Yeah well not around here pal.

319
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:56,272
Okay.

320
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:59,632
Name's Sam, friends call me Sammy.

321
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:04,134
My real name's Samuel
but nobody calls me that.

322
00:18:04,144 --> 00:18:06,227
Can I ask you a question?

323
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:07,797
What?

324
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:11,435
Do you think you could kick my ass?

325
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:13,014
Fuck you man.

326
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:14,699
Nah seriously man.

327
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,894
If we were in a fight do you
think you could kick my ass?

328
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:18,776
I don't know do you want to find out?

329
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:25,115
Holy shit, yeah look at
the stones on this dude.

330
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,292
I like this mother fucker.

331
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:31,531
Seriously dude, back the fuck off.

332
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,958
Just calm down.

333
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,718
I didn't come out here
to get my ass kicked.

334
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:38,728
Then what do you want?

335
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:40,190
Where do you live?

336
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,694
Why do you want to know?

337
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,502
Well look around man.

338
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:44,861
We're in the middle of fucking nowhere

339
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:47,502
and I haven't talked
to anybody new in ages.

340
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:48,590
What do you want to act like a couple

341
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,774
of fucking girlfriends, talk about what

342
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:51,806
we're gonna wear to school
tomorrow or something?

343
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:53,182
Yes, more than anything.

344
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:54,910
Well I'm not fucking interested dude okay.

345
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,003
So just do me favor man and piss off.

346
00:18:58,774 --> 00:19:01,806
Oh come on man just
spare me like five minutes.

347
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:04,066
What do you want to know?

348
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:06,588
Where are you from?

349
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:09,246
I lived in Chicago for the last 10 years

350
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:10,989
but I'm from Oklahoma okay.

351
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:11,999
No shit?

352
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:13,808
No shit.

353
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,166
You heading to Oklahoma now?

354
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:18,176
Yeah.

355
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:19,808
How come?

356
00:19:21,848 --> 00:19:23,054
Because the last couple of days

357
00:19:23,064 --> 00:19:24,574
I found out my wife has been fucking

358
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:26,218
some douche bag behind my back,

359
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:27,390
the van that I was using to store

360
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,022
all my belongings in was stolen,

361
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:31,868
and I told my boss to go fuck herself.

362
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:33,545
You like to party?

363
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
What?

364
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:38,045
Well you seem like a
dude that needs to like

365
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:41,638
stop using his brain for a little while so,

366
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,041
you want to get fucked up with me?

367
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:49,248
Yeah okay.

368
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:51,584
Cool man.

369
00:19:58,968 --> 00:19:59,792
See that's the problem nowadays,

370
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:02,158
everybody wants to cross
over like The Rock you know.

371
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:05,550
Back in the day the supersize
was what is was all about.

372
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,366
Where wrestling was at it's purest form.

373
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:09,215
Like Andre the Giant?

374
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:11,886
Like Andre the Giant, when
the Hulkster pinned him,

375
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:14,750
did the old scoop slam
an tucked him into one,

376
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,927
forget about it, give me
Superfly Snuka off the top rope.

377
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:24,084
Oh fuck.

378
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:26,882
Isn't this your house man?

379
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,170
Yeah it is, it's just my girl.

380
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,012
She gets a little paranoid sometimes.

381
00:20:32,938 --> 00:20:34,605
Misty open the door.

382
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:39,881
Who the fuck is that?

383
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,986
He's a friend of mine.

384
00:20:41,996 --> 00:20:46,163
I've never seen him before what's his name?

385
00:20:46,635 --> 00:20:48,135
Oh Riley, Riley.

386
00:20:50,444 --> 00:20:51,826
He looks like a cop.

387
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:53,253
He's not a cop.

388
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:55,970
You're not a cop right?

389
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,647
No, I'm not a cop.

390
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:02,936
Would you open the fucking door already?

391
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:07,451
Thank you for allowing me into my own home.

392
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:11,207
Are you coming in or what?

393
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,517
I like your place, you been here long?

394
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:31,929
It's temporary.

395
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,822
'Til when?

396
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:38,915
I don't know until the
fucking owner finds out.

397
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,417
You can sit down if you want.

398
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,527
No I'm good.

399
00:21:46,464 --> 00:21:48,714
So how do you know Sammy?

400
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:50,853
I just met him actually,

401
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:53,525
under the bleachers at the high school.

402
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:54,359
Got it.

403
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:56,310
You were at the fucking bleachers?

404
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,101
I thought you were gonna
go ask Mack for a job.

405
00:21:58,111 --> 00:21:59,111
No, what?

406
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:04,446
I was, I am, I, I, I just
needed to relax first.

407
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:06,504
Bullshit.

408
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,822
Why don't you get a fucking job?

409
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:09,832
Fuck you.

410
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:10,872
Fuck you.

411
00:22:11,616 --> 00:22:14,366
Come on baby we got company here.

412
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:18,534
You ready to do this?

413
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:20,137
What is it?

414
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:21,496
Shrhooms.

415
00:22:23,696 --> 00:22:25,174
You done shrooms before right?

416
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:26,184
No.

417
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:32,307
Oh man you are gonna love it.

418
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:34,662
I just need 60 bucks.

419
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:36,248
What?

420
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:38,726
60 bucks for the shrooms.

421
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:39,736
Seriously?

422
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:44,736
I don't know if, I have like, I have 41.

423
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:47,195
Just enough.

424
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,863
You are going to love it.

425
00:22:52,556 --> 00:22:53,650
You gonna partake or are you just gonna

426
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,730
sit there and be a bitch all day?

427
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,990
Fuck you and give me one.

428
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,403
Bombs away.

429
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:14,438
What like you just eat them?

430
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:16,534
Oh man just chew them
up and swallow them whole.

431
00:23:16,544 --> 00:23:17,718
Like all of them?

432
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:19,645
The more the merrier.

433
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:21,536
What's gonna happen to me?

434
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,020
You're gonna see the future.

435
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,890
Ah man they taste like shit.

436
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,150
That just means that they're working.

437
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,363
When do these things kick in?

438
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,759
About 30 minutes or so.

439
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:54,071
Welcome to Thunderdome.

440
00:23:56,988 --> 00:23:58,466
Hey man you okay?

441
00:23:58,476 --> 00:23:59,826
It's only a Martian, it's only a Martian,

442
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:00,738
it's only a Martian.

443
00:24:00,748 --> 00:24:01,874
Is he okay?

444
00:24:01,884 --> 00:24:04,752
I think he's talking to the aliens.

445
00:24:04,762 --> 00:24:08,781
Hey man you just need to calm
down and come in for a swim.

446
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,124
Shit, oh shit.

447
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,370
Oh man, I think he's
tripping on the dark side.

448
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,547
Oh the water is filled with
the spirit of the dinosaurs.

449
00:24:21,852 --> 00:24:22,860
I know baby.

450
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:27,055
The world is a vampire!

451
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:28,356
No no no.

452
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,964
Where you going?

453
00:24:30,974 --> 00:24:31,986
Kings Landing.

454
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:32,819
Where?

455
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:33,652
Kings Landing.

456
00:24:33,662 --> 00:24:34,543
Where the fuck is that?

457
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:35,570
Hurry.

458
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,403
What?

459
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:37,236
Oh shit.

460
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:38,070
Where?

461
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,010
Kings Landing, on your horse.

462
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,684
Okay we'll meet your there.

463
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:00,434
You can't have me, you
can't cut through my bones.

464
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:01,861
They're my bones!

465
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:11,860
You don't realize

466
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,602
how little you have in life until you

467
00:26:13,612 --> 00:26:17,724
find yourself walking completely
naked through Nebraska.

468
00:26:59,793 --> 00:27:03,710
Son, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

469
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:09,694
Kind of a long story.

470
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:16,184
Let me guess, I don't want
to know the details right?

471
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:20,109
Probably not no.

472
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,057
Alright follow me.

473
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,602
Honey, we've got company.

474
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:39,945
Hello.

475
00:27:41,937 --> 00:27:42,937
Hi.

476
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:46,180
Says his name is Riley.

477
00:27:46,657 --> 00:27:48,740
Nice to meet you Riley.

478
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:50,569
You too.

479
00:27:51,777 --> 00:27:53,831
I'd shake your hand but I'm covering...

480
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:56,841
That's quite alright I understand.

481
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:00,442
You need some clothes.

482
00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:02,298
Yeah that'd be nice.

483
00:28:03,574 --> 00:28:04,574
Follow me.

484
00:28:09,861 --> 00:28:13,084
Well not an exact fit but close enough.

485
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:17,094
This is great Rose thank
you, I appreciate it.

486
00:28:19,108 --> 00:28:21,242
You know you confuse me.

487
00:28:21,252 --> 00:28:22,335
Me, how so?

488
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:26,924
You just don't seem like
the kind of guy that goes

489
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:29,624
traipsing around the
countryside with no clothes on.

490
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:31,884
Well it's a first for me.

491
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,980
You know they reserve that behavior

492
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,657
for the dimwitted and the crazy.

493
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:38,792
So who are you?

494
00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:43,646
Kind of trying to figure that out.

495
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,163
What are you gonna do now?

496
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,882
I'm gonna figure out
where it all went wrong.

497
00:28:49,892 --> 00:28:52,076
So how are you gonna do that?

498
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:56,253
I don't know, start from
the beginning I suppose.

499
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,396
You seem like a pretty determined young man

500
00:28:58,406 --> 00:29:00,236
so I think you're gonna get it figured out.

501
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:02,924
Just hey, keep your clothes on next time.

502
00:29:02,934 --> 00:29:04,351
Alright I will.

503
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,356
Does your mother know where you are?

504
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:10,366
No.

505
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,815
You should call her.

506
00:29:13,077 --> 00:29:15,500
I'm on my way to see her now actually.

507
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,700
She'll be pleased.

508
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,710
I hope so.

509
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:21,164
Sure we can't give you a ride in to town?

510
00:29:21,174 --> 00:29:23,036
No no, I'm good, you've done enough.

511
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:23,870
I'm gonna hit the road.

512
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,476
Wait, I know you lost your wallet so.

513
00:29:26,486 --> 00:29:28,010
No, no no no no no I don't.

514
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,020
No it's not a request.

515
00:29:30,806 --> 00:29:32,473
Thank you, really.

516
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,408
I'll pay you back I swear.

517
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:41,585
I hope you find what
you're looking for out there.

518
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,947
Thank you Rose.

519
00:29:45,858 --> 00:29:47,025
See you later.

520
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,190
See you later man.

521
00:31:35,939 --> 00:31:37,439
You need any help?

522
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:38,667
I'm fine.

523
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:45,637
Just the jack kind of works
better if you turn it around.

524
00:31:45,647 --> 00:31:46,730
This thing?

525
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:47,722
Yeah.

526
00:31:47,732 --> 00:31:48,732
This way?

527
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:53,435
Then what?

528
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:55,208
You mind if I?

529
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:58,903
I won't like try anything
weird or anything.

530
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:02,489
Well good 'cause I don't
want to have to cut you.

531
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:04,977
Yeah I wouldn't want that either.

532
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:06,750
Alright, let me make sure it's

533
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,343
low enough to get to the ridge.

534
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:14,401
Then you brace it against something solid.

535
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:15,411
And voila.

536
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:22,097
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

537
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,190
No problem.

538
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,870
You know a lot of about cars?

539
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,047
Actually it's like the
only thing I know how to do.

540
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,735
My dad always used to try to explain to me

541
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,912
how to do this kind of stuff
but I never paid attention.

542
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,910
Probably should have listened more.

543
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:48,584
Well my dad said that I'd
never be useful for anything.

544
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:54,739
Well you're proving him wrong.

545
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:56,249
Yeah I guess so.

546
00:32:57,841 --> 00:32:58,841
I'm Annie.

547
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,521
I'm Riley.

548
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:06,752
Where's your car?

549
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:09,591
I don't have one.

550
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:11,434
You're a hitchhiker?

551
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:14,434
Yeah I guess, I don't know.

552
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:17,751
You're just walking across the country?

553
00:33:17,761 --> 00:33:19,829
Well my journey kinda just began.

554
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:22,261
I hadn't put much thought into it.

555
00:33:22,271 --> 00:33:24,791
Are you having a midlife crisis?

556
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:26,471
How old do you think I am?

557
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:28,814
Okay, quarter life crisis.

558
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:32,951
Actually I hadn't put much
thought into that either.

559
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:36,167
Have you put thought
into where your headed?

560
00:33:36,177 --> 00:33:39,677
Yeah I'm gonna see my folks in Oklahoma.

561
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:43,391
Fuck, okay fine I'll drive you.

562
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:47,207
No you don't have to drive me...

563
00:33:47,217 --> 00:33:48,934
Yes, yes I do have to drive you.

564
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:52,709
Your fixing my tire, all the
signs are pointing to it.

565
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:54,551
I have been ignoring that
bitch for a long time

566
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:57,079
and she's finally kicking my ass.

567
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:58,089
Who?

568
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:00,642
Karma, fucking Karma.

569
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:02,345
You believe in that?

570
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:04,883
Like the what goes around
comes around kind of thing?

571
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:06,311
Well I know my life's been one

572
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:08,023
shitty occurrence after another

573
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:11,019
and either I was randomly
destined to live a life of shit,

574
00:34:11,029 --> 00:34:13,579
which I'm really hoping is not the case,

575
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:17,756
or it's you know payback for
being an asshole or something.

576
00:34:18,612 --> 00:34:21,362
Either way I am trying to change.

577
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:28,615
Fix my fucking tire so
I can give you a ride.

578
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:30,208
Take a hint, Jesus.

579
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,149
Really do appreciate it though.

580
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:56,099
So what's your story?

581
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:58,469
My story?

582
00:34:58,589 --> 00:34:59,763
Yeah there must be an
interesting back story

583
00:34:59,773 --> 00:35:03,235
that brought you and I together
here at this very moment.

584
00:35:03,245 --> 00:35:05,699
It's not as exciting as you might think.

585
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:07,792
Well I want to hear it.

586
00:35:09,995 --> 00:35:11,139
I just found out my wife has been

587
00:35:11,149 --> 00:35:13,475
fucking somebody behind my back.

588
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:14,485
Really?

589
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:18,083
Yeah, can't really
bounce back after that one.

590
00:35:18,093 --> 00:35:20,691
I found my husband naked in bed

591
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,554
with my best friend a couple of years ago.

592
00:35:23,564 --> 00:35:25,981
Holy shit, what did you do?

593
00:35:26,221 --> 00:35:29,507
I did what any sane woman
in that situation would do.

594
00:35:29,517 --> 00:35:31,475
I drug that naked bitch into the front yard

595
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:35,395
by her hair and shoved her
face in a pile of dog shit.

596
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:38,259
Wow, I wish I would
have thought of that one.

597
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,463
Yeah well, a lot of good it did me.

598
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:43,306
We got divorced, they got married.

599
00:35:43,549 --> 00:35:44,404
And I'm still trying to figure out

600
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:47,746
what the fuck I'm gonna do with my life.

601
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:53,166
Don't worry, it gets better.

602
00:35:53,729 --> 00:35:54,729
Yeah how?

603
00:35:55,745 --> 00:35:58,547
Well you don't forget or anything but

604
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:01,724
eventually the anger starts to go away

605
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:05,543
and you think about them
less and less every day.

606
00:36:05,553 --> 00:36:07,220
Sounds exhausting.

607
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:10,435
Well they're just stress for you.

608
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:11,273
What you need is to find some

609
00:36:11,283 --> 00:36:14,199
random chick and get yourself laid.

610
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:18,088
Okay, you make it sound so easy.

611
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:20,587
I mean I haven't been with another

612
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:22,235
woman other than my wife in years.

613
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:25,078
How I'm supposed to pull that off?

614
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:36,958
Is this okay?

615
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:37,791
Yes.

616
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:38,624
Really?

617
00:36:38,634 --> 00:36:39,457
It's not bad for you.

618
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:40,467
Okay.

619
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:46,505
'Cause I haven't done this in like forever.

620
00:36:46,515 --> 00:36:49,682
I know, just stop thinking about it.

621
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,639
Oh God, being divorced is awesome.

622
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:16,131
You're like the most perfect
woman I've ever seen.

623
00:37:16,141 --> 00:37:19,183
Oh God, it has been
awhile for you hasn't it?

624
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:54,327
Morning.

625
00:37:54,863 --> 00:37:57,780
Sorry, I didn't want to wake you.

626
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:00,502
That's okay.

627
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:04,637
Check out isn't until 11 so if you want to,

628
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:06,397
sleep in or whatever.

629
00:38:07,527 --> 00:38:08,989
Where you going?

630
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:10,582
I gotta get home.

631
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:13,589
You gonna do the walk of shame?

632
00:38:13,735 --> 00:38:15,568
No, last night was...

633
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:19,967
Fun, it's been a long time since I

634
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:22,889
enjoyed myself that
many times in one night.

635
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:24,649
Yeah, okay come on.

636
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:28,925
Can you get the rest of the way yourself?

637
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:31,518
Yeah, it's not far from here.

638
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:37,606
So is the last time I'm gonna see you?

639
00:38:39,755 --> 00:38:40,755
Yes.

640
00:38:48,278 --> 00:38:50,611
I'm really glad I met you.

641
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:52,367
Likewise.

642
00:38:59,301 --> 00:39:01,051
You're gonna be fine.

643
00:39:01,895 --> 00:39:03,562
Thank you.

644
00:39:36,812 --> 00:39:37,812
Hey.

645
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,020
Riley?

646
00:39:43,036 --> 00:39:44,536
Hey Dad.

647
00:39:46,604 --> 00:39:48,770
What the hell are you doing here?

648
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,434
I was in the neighborhood.

649
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:52,434
What are you doing, where's your car?

650
00:39:52,444 --> 00:39:53,666
No car this time.

651
00:39:53,676 --> 00:39:55,926
What, how'd you get here?

652
00:39:56,076 --> 00:39:58,409
What the hell are you doing?

653
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,527
It's a long story.

654
00:40:03,324 --> 00:40:04,833
You wanna beer or something?

655
00:40:04,843 --> 00:40:08,010
Yes, that'd be great yeah, let's go.

656
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:09,876
How's mom?

657
00:40:09,886 --> 00:40:13,334
Oh actually she's just doing really well.

658
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,589
What do you mean she wants a divorce?

659
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,432
She wants a divorce.

660
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,630
Well did you tell her
that she couldn't have one?

661
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,723
No.

662
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,920
Why not?

663
00:40:23,408 --> 00:40:25,110
I'm not gonna do that.

664
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,037
Honey, look if you want something

665
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,710
you have to fight for it.

666
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,628
I don't think I want it.

667
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,638
Why not?

668
00:40:35,776 --> 00:40:37,930
I haven't wanted it for a long time.

669
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,018
I was just doing it 'cause that I thought

670
00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:41,642
you were supposed to do, I don't know.

671
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:44,378
Well that's just the
dumbest thing I ever heard.

672
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:45,386
I know it doesn't make sense to you

673
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:46,570
because you guys love each other,

674
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,121
you're made for one another.

675
00:40:48,131 --> 00:40:50,464
Riley marriage isn't easy.

676
00:40:51,204 --> 00:40:53,121
You think that is easy?

677
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:55,383
No I don't think it's easy but

678
00:40:55,393 --> 00:40:56,824
there's got to be a fundamental desire

679
00:40:56,834 --> 00:41:00,618
to want the same things
and be on the same page.

680
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:04,282
We weren't like that,
haven't been for awhile.

681
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:08,375
Well this is all coming
as quite a shock to us.

682
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:11,378
I just, we just always thought that

683
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:13,888
you were so content and happy.

684
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,072
Well we weren't.

685
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,367
I hate that you ever had to feel that way.

686
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,947
Yeah me too.

687
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:27,129
So where's all your stuff?

688
00:41:35,132 --> 00:41:38,050
I don't know if I feel good about you

689
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,562
going down to the bar
and drinking by yourself.

690
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:44,739
Fine Mom, I just, I need to
clear my head a little bit.

691
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,954
You want your dad to
go down there with you?

692
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,802
I'll be fine, I just need some along time.

693
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:53,282
You're not getting in a fight are you?

694
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:54,626
Why would I get into a fight?

695
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:56,166
Riley I know you, every single time

696
00:41:56,176 --> 00:41:59,190
you get frustrated you start a fight.

697
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,024
No I don't.

698
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:01,116
Yes you do.

699
00:42:05,628 --> 00:42:08,006
I promise I won't get into a fight.

700
00:42:08,016 --> 00:42:10,433
Okay, but if you do call us

701
00:42:10,704 --> 00:42:13,954
and I'll send your dad down for backup.

702
00:42:14,144 --> 00:42:15,144
Alright.

703
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,430
He's a real tiger.

704
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,440
Yeah.

705
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,063
Howard, Howard, say goodbye, say goodbye.

706
00:42:22,288 --> 00:42:23,288
Bye.

707
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,295
I always get a strange

708
00:42:46,305 --> 00:42:49,387
feeling inside when I come back home.

709
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:55,238
When I was a kid I felt
completely empty growing up.

710
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:58,006
I never felt like I quite belonged.

711
00:42:58,016 --> 00:42:59,510
I was always searching for something else

712
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,134
out there in the world you know.

713
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:03,561
Guess I still am.

714
00:43:05,344 --> 00:43:06,454
Mother fucker.

715
00:43:06,464 --> 00:43:07,297
Jesus.

716
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,486
What the fuck are you doing here?

717
00:43:08,496 --> 00:43:10,329
Tommy what's up man?

718
00:43:10,448 --> 00:43:12,774
What you come to town, you
can't call your oldest friend?

719
00:43:12,784 --> 00:43:15,034
It kind of just happened.

720
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:18,191
Dude you alright?

721
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:20,086
I been better man.

722
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:22,966
Aw damn, did you like hit rock bottom?

723
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,559
That's why you're back in town?

724
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,617
How you doing, you alright?

725
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,814
Same old same old you know.

726
00:43:31,824 --> 00:43:35,574
Work like a fucking dog
working my balls off.

727
00:43:35,632 --> 00:43:37,132

738
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,987

die right in front of you.

756

It kinda is.

782
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:50,018
Like every 16 year old in
this town has fucking kids.

783
00:45:50,028 --> 00:45:53,650
We're all just stupid and
we forget to pull out.

784
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,674
I don't know if you know what it's like

785
00:45:54,684 --> 00:45:56,834
to have small children but it doesn't stop.

786
00:45:56,844 --> 00:45:59,522
They're so fucking annoying,
they don't ever leave you alone

787
00:45:59,532 --> 00:46:02,834
they're like Dad, Dad, Dad,
Dad, Dad can I sit in your lap?

788
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,010

And they're like ah they were in my butt.

00:46:10,428 --> 00:46:14,402
And like Dad, Dad, like
why is the men in the sky?

793
00:46:14,412 --> 00:46:16,245
I'm like I don't know.

794
00:46:16,283 --> 00:46:17,282
Why does the dog have brown hair?

795
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:19,282
I'm like I don't fucking know like,

796
00:46:19,292 --> 00:46:22,034

797
00:46:22,044 --> 00:46:24,626
I could research some of this for you.

798
00:46:24,636 --> 00:46:27,719
And then Missy, oh she loves me yeah.

799
00:46:27,803 --> 00:46:29,122
Yeah she really loves me but it's all

800
00:46:29,132 --> 00:46:32,450
a big fucking show like
you know she wants us,

801
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,506
she's more concerned of us appearing happy

802
00:46:35,516 --> 00:46:37,586
you know then what's really going on.

803
00:46:37,596 --> 00:46:40,786
Like she doesn't like let
me fuck her doggy style

804
00:46:40,796 --> 00:46:43,074
or she's like that and
like when you have kids

805
00:46:43,084 --> 00:46:45,522

806
00:46:45,532 --> 00:46:48,615
so even blowjobs you know that's out.

807
00:46:49,452 --> 00:46:52,619
It's kinda like, it's like, it's shut.

808
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:57,619
What's shut?

809
00:46:57,629 --> 00:47:00,878
Like you know her business is closed.

810
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:04,531
It's not like tight shut, it's like,

811
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,018
you know if you don't use it it goes away.

812
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:10,080
Feels like it's like there was a plague

813
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,340
down there called our children and now.

814
00:47:16,812 --> 00:47:17,635
No business.

815
00:47:17,645 --> 00:47:18,469
Business is closed.

816
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:20,130
Business is closed yeah.

817
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,202
You know that is the
reason why I come here.

818
00:47:23,212 --> 00:47:26,530
Just to get away you know
just drink with people

819
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:30,290
and shoot pool, there's
a lot of losers here.

820
00:47:36,526 --> 00:47:38,776
Man, let's get out of here.

821
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,575
What, where do you want to go?

822
00:47:41,585 --> 00:47:43,790
I don't know this place is suffocating me.

823
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,133
I need some air.

824
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,126
Where are we, where are you gonna go?

825
00:47:48,136 --> 00:47:50,219
I don't know, let's go.

826
00:47:53,968 --> 00:47:55,385
Come on let's go.

827
00:48:01,051 --> 00:48:03,634
God look at this fucking place.

828
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,390
Can you even believe we grew up here?

829
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,182
It's hard to remember even living here man.

830
00:48:08,192 --> 00:48:10,278
Dude you're so smart
for getting out of here.

831
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:12,455
I got myself chained here.

832
00:48:15,773 --> 00:48:17,174
You ever think about
where it all went wrong?

833
00:48:17,184 --> 00:48:21,101
Yes, yes every fucking
single day of my life.

834
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:22,616
You have any answers?

835
00:48:22,626 --> 00:48:24,292
Yeah May 29, 2003.

836
00:48:25,342 --> 00:48:26,678
You have the exact date?

837
00:48:26,688 --> 00:48:28,422
Yeah that was our high school graduation.

838
00:48:28,432 --> 00:48:30,406
Do remember we made that pact?

839
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:31,240
We were gonna break up with

840
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,302
our girlfriends at the after party?

841
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:34,312
Holy shit.

842
00:48:34,368 --> 00:48:35,368
Yeah.

843
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,939
I totally remember that oh my God.

844
00:48:36,949 --> 00:48:38,062
We promised each other we were

845
00:48:38,072 --> 00:48:41,374
gonna be free and bang whoever we wanted.

846
00:48:41,384 --> 00:48:42,733
Yeah what did we call that?

847
00:48:42,743 --> 00:48:43,567
We called it

848
00:48:43,577 --> 00:48:45,230
the summer of love, yeah.
- The summer of love.

849
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,950
But I'm a fucking pussy
ass and I chicken shit out

850
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,543
and I stay with Missy so now 10 years later

851
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:57,697
I regret that every day
of my life, every day.

852
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,550
God I could have done anything I wanted to.

853
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,118
I can't believe I broke
up with Becca that night.

854
00:49:05,128 --> 00:49:06,590
The fucking President if I wanted to.

855
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,030
She was so smart, like
funny too, she was funny.

856
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,094
She was cute she was like,
she had that crooked smile

857
00:49:12,104 --> 00:49:14,414
and those perky high school tits.

858
00:49:14,424 --> 00:49:15,424
Yep.

859
00:49:16,327 --> 00:49:17,997
No but she was deep though.

860
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:21,982
Like we spent hours just like
talking and laughing and...

861
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:22,816
Fucking.

862
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,325
Yeah, even that.

863
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,913
You know what's weird?

864
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:32,222
It's like the most mature
relationship I ever had.

865
00:49:32,232 --> 00:49:33,646
And you let that go?

866
00:49:33,656 --> 00:49:34,814
Fuck you man.

867
00:49:34,824 --> 00:49:36,158
Do you know why?

868
00:49:36,168 --> 00:49:39,470
Because we're stupid we were stupid kids.

869
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,670
You let a good one go and I
stayed with a fucking bitch,

870
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,680
a fun destroying narcissistic woman.

871
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,862
I haven't seen Becca in
forever, I wonder what she's like.

872
00:49:50,872 --> 00:49:52,622
I saw her recently.

873
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,584
Really?

874
00:49:53,594 --> 00:49:57,674
Yeah, I ran into her she was
in town at the grocery store.

875
00:49:57,684 --> 00:49:58,862
How'd she look?

876
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:01,437
I mean she was always
cute but she looks good,

877
00:50:01,447 --> 00:50:05,470
like she's fine, like you know
she's grown up and sexy now.

878
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,303
Shit.

879
00:50:06,313 --> 00:50:07,313
Yeah.

880
00:50:07,336 --> 00:50:09,278
I mean did you like talk to her?

881
00:50:09,288 --> 00:50:10,958
Yeah yeah I did talk to her.

882
00:50:10,968 --> 00:50:13,218
She's married, she has
kids, she lives in Denver.

883
00:50:13,228 --> 00:50:14,052
Denver.

884
00:50:14,062 --> 00:50:15,954
Yeah, her husband's family

885
00:50:15,964 --> 00:50:18,881
owns a bank or something like that.

886
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,761
Why did I break up with
her, God damn it fuck.

887
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:24,241
I don't know but she asked about you.

888
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:25,075
Did she really?

889
00:50:25,085 --> 00:50:28,130
Yeah, she just asked like
how you were and stuff.

890
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,370
Well what'd she say though?

891
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,305
I mean she just said that like how...

892
00:50:32,315 --> 00:50:33,328
No but what did she say?

893
00:50:33,338 --> 00:50:34,914
Shit man I told you she was just like

894
00:50:34,924 --> 00:50:37,174
how is he, how is he doing?

895
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,784
You know she called me a
couple of days before my wedding.

896
00:50:40,794 --> 00:50:41,794
What?

897
00:50:42,324 --> 00:50:43,148
What?

898
00:50:43,158 --> 00:50:47,074
Holy shit she tried to
break up your wedding.

899
00:50:47,702 --> 00:50:48,525
No she didn't.

900
00:50:48,535 --> 00:50:49,359
- Yeah.
- No.

901
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,310
She just called to congratulate
me and see if I was happy.

902
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,442
No woman calls you, no
ex-girlfriend calls you

903
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:56,910
right before your wedding
unless she wants to break it up.

904
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,744
That wasn't how it was.

905
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:59,566
Dude you're stupid
'cause she didn't say that

906
00:50:59,576 --> 00:51:02,958
but that's exactly what she
meant, I know these things.

907
00:51:02,968 --> 00:51:04,551
You think really?

908
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,484
Fuck me.

909
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:12,660
Yeah, yeah fuck us both.

910
00:51:17,148 --> 00:51:19,481
Dude let's go get fucked up.

911
00:51:20,204 --> 00:51:22,037
Let's go do something.

912
00:51:23,312 --> 00:51:24,312
Alright.

913
00:51:24,335 --> 00:51:25,648
Come on let's go.

914
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:39,414
Tommy what are we doing man, come on?

915
00:51:39,424 --> 00:51:40,248
Trust fall.

916
00:51:40,258 --> 00:51:41,302
No not a trust fall.

917
00:51:41,312 --> 00:51:42,231
What are we doing here?

918
00:51:42,241 --> 00:51:44,064
Just correcting the past.

919
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,880
What?

920
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,870
No, no no no, they're so young.

921
00:52:07,232 --> 00:52:09,142
Just calm down.

922
00:52:09,152 --> 00:52:12,819
They're like 13 years old shut up.

923
00:52:12,948 --> 00:52:15,115
Hey ladies, I'm thirsty.

924
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:20,810
So what's your names?

925
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,903
Amber, this is Caitlin.

926
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,853
Hi.

927
00:52:24,916 --> 00:52:25,851
How old are you?

928
00:52:25,861 --> 00:52:27,178
We're about to be seniors.

929
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:28,188
Hot.

930
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:30,330
How old are you?

931
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,423
Old enough.

932
00:52:32,404 --> 00:52:33,404
Okay.

933
00:52:33,476 --> 00:52:34,976
Are you married?

934
00:52:35,636 --> 00:52:36,636
No, why?

935
00:52:37,252 --> 00:52:38,874
'Cause you have a wedding ring on.

936
00:52:38,884 --> 00:52:41,530
No I wear this 'cause
I'm a fucking bad ass.

937
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,540
Oh okay.

938
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:46,202
So you guys have little
boyfriends or something?

939
00:52:46,212 --> 00:52:47,212
Maybe.

940
00:52:49,523 --> 00:52:51,802
So maybe, what kind of answer is that?

941
00:52:51,812 --> 00:52:53,812
Well what's it to you?

942
00:52:53,892 --> 00:52:57,809
Well if you don't, you
two can party with us.

943
00:52:58,036 --> 00:52:59,338
What if we do?

944
00:52:59,348 --> 00:53:02,665
Well if you do, you
can still party with us.

945
00:53:02,675 --> 00:53:05,098
Oh I see, this evening
we're gonna party with you?

946
00:53:05,108 --> 00:53:05,932
We're already partying.

947
00:53:05,942 --> 00:53:07,434
You call this a fucking party?

948
00:53:07,444 --> 00:53:09,626
Yeah what do you call it?

949
00:53:09,636 --> 00:53:11,882
The beginning of the end.

950
00:53:11,892 --> 00:53:13,559
I think he's high.

951
00:53:15,564 --> 00:53:17,602
You wanna get out of here?

952
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,650
I can buy you booze it's cool.

953
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,057
Are you serious?

954
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:23,250
Would you get us some wine coolers?

955
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,922
Yeah, yeah we can drink
wine coolers, it's cool.

956
00:53:25,932 --> 00:53:26,977
Really?

957
00:53:26,987 --> 00:53:28,354
My brother loves wine coolers.

958
00:53:28,364 --> 00:53:30,466
Oh yeah, they're so good.

959
00:53:30,476 --> 00:53:32,449
Oh you think that's funny?

960
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,809
Well my mom drinks them so...

961
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:34,707
Oh your mom must be pretty cool.

962
00:53:34,717 --> 00:53:36,204
Cops.

963
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:47,689
If you don't run they won't catch you.

964
00:53:58,844 --> 00:54:01,474
The Johnsons have a pool we
just have to hop the fence.

965
00:54:01,484 --> 00:54:02,567
No, no way.

966
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:06,708
I'll help you guys, I'll help you guys.

967
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:07,857
Why are you freaking?

968
00:54:07,867 --> 00:54:11,533
Okay good then hold my
heels, hold my heels.

969
00:54:12,348 --> 00:54:13,714
You're breaking and entering.

970
00:54:13,724 --> 00:54:14,974
What?

971
00:54:17,657 --> 00:54:18,657
Careful.

972
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:20,323
Over, you're good to go.

973
00:54:29,527 --> 00:54:30,527
Oh God.

974
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:32,289
Hurry up!

975
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:35,071
Okay I don't think anyone's home.

976
00:54:35,081 --> 00:54:37,581
I don't think so, oh my God.

977
00:54:38,905 --> 00:54:41,085
I don't think they're home.

978
00:54:41,095 --> 00:54:42,095
Okay okay.

979
00:54:47,593 --> 00:54:50,093
Are you guys coming?

980
00:54:50,405 --> 00:54:51,279
Yeah.

981
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,113
Well hurry up.

982
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:53,343
Yeah okay.

983
00:54:53,353 --> 00:54:54,905
Holy shit.

984
00:55:05,529 --> 00:55:06,353
Sometimes you know

985
00:55:06,363 --> 00:55:08,751
when you're about to do
something very stupid.

986
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:09,761
Yeah Tommy!

987
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:15,505
Fine.

988
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,935
And other times

989
00:55:17,945 --> 00:55:20,921
you just have to shut your
brain off and do it anyway.

990
00:55:24,557 --> 00:55:26,057
Finally.

991
00:56:35,387 --> 00:56:37,393
Did you know that Riley and I,

992
00:56:37,403 --> 00:56:39,809
we were captains of the baseball team?

993
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:42,641
You were captains, were you guys any good?

994
00:56:42,651 --> 00:56:43,484
Yep.

995
00:56:43,579 --> 00:56:44,402
Really?

996
00:56:44,412 --> 00:56:45,330
Yeah we went to state.

997
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,839
Wow look at you, that's so sexy.

998
00:56:49,032 --> 00:56:51,217
I couldn't play 'cause I got injured.

999
00:56:51,227 --> 00:56:52,977
You did, where why?

1000
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:57,192
I got hit by a ball, I
broke my jaw right here.

1001
00:56:57,202 --> 00:56:58,130
Was it right there?

1002
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,729
You see there's a scar,
it's under my beard.

1003
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:00,897
I don't see anything.

1004
00:57:00,907 --> 00:57:01,953
Well you have to look close.

1005
00:57:01,963 --> 00:57:03,046
I'm trying.

1006
00:57:06,283 --> 00:57:09,700
You ass, what the hell is wrong with you?

1007
00:57:10,395 --> 00:57:11,729
He does that a lot?

1008
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:13,393
Oh my God.

1009
00:57:13,403 --> 00:57:16,781
But Riley, Riley hit like two grand slams.

1010
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:18,609
In the second grand slam one game

1011
00:57:18,619 --> 00:57:22,369
he just connected and
he went all the way in,

1012
00:57:23,215 --> 00:57:24,039
remember it hit the prinicple's car?

1013
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:27,301
It hit the principle's
car, broke a window yeah.

1014
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:28,528
What?

1015
00:57:28,538 --> 00:57:29,477
How much trouble did you get in?

1016
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,310
- None.
- That's ridiculous.

1017
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,143
None?

1018
00:57:31,153 --> 00:57:31,977
'Cause we won.

1019
00:57:31,987 --> 00:57:33,269
He had a good arm.

1020
00:57:33,279 --> 00:57:34,421
Well that's good.

1021
00:57:34,431 --> 00:57:36,917
Do you wanna go see my
tree I used to hang out at?

1022
00:57:36,927 --> 00:57:38,837
You're tree you used to
take all your chicks too?

1023
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:40,756
No it was my hangout
tree, you wanna go see it?

1024
00:57:40,766 --> 00:57:42,901
I would love to see your hangout tree.

1025
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,245
I'm a gentleman you
wanna go see for yourself?

1026
00:57:44,255 --> 00:57:48,338
Okay let's go.

1027
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,205
The line that she's saying is so fun.

1028
00:57:51,215 --> 00:57:52,569
I would have carried

1029
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:55,246
but you didn't have heels on so.

1030
00:57:56,163 --> 00:57:58,246
No it's okay.

1031
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:01,671
So, you're gonna be a senior?

1032
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:04,651
Yep.

1033
00:58:07,011 --> 00:58:10,428
Do you have any plans after graduation?

1034
00:58:11,123 --> 00:58:11,976
Do you really want to talk about

1035
00:58:11,986 --> 00:58:14,485
my graduation plans right now?

1036
00:58:14,643 --> 00:58:16,226
What do you mean?

1037
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:21,168
I mean we're alone
hanging out in the dugout.

1038
00:58:23,713 --> 00:58:27,880
Most guys would be trying
to make a move by now so.

1039
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:30,714
I vaguely remember that yeah.

1040
00:58:37,603 --> 00:58:39,936
So do you want to kiss me?

1041
00:58:42,499 --> 00:58:45,801
I don't think that's
such a good idea Caitlin.

1042
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:47,978
That's not what I asked.

1043
00:58:53,808 --> 00:58:56,391
Okay, alright, how old are you?

1044
00:58:57,026 --> 00:58:58,553
Like really how old are though?

1045
00:58:58,563 --> 00:58:59,386
Really?

1046
00:58:59,396 --> 00:59:00,396
Yeah.

1047
00:59:00,627 --> 00:59:01,627
I'm 29.

1048
00:59:02,675 --> 00:59:03,833
Are you serious?

1049
00:59:03,843 --> 00:59:04,843
Yeah.

1050
00:59:04,915 --> 00:59:05,739
Okay.

1051
00:59:05,749 --> 00:59:08,649
No, we seriously we can't, I can't.

1052
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:10,473
Relax I'm not gonna tell anyone.

1053
00:59:10,483 --> 00:59:11,929
I know I just, that's not the issue.

1054
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:13,335
I just don't want you to be my age

1055
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:15,863
and look back on the day that you

1056
00:59:15,873 --> 00:59:19,161
made a mistake by kissing some old dude.

1057
00:59:19,171 --> 00:59:20,171
A mistake?

1058
00:59:20,803 --> 00:59:24,136
Do you overthink things like this a lot?

1059
00:59:24,563 --> 00:59:26,396
I suppose I do yeah.

1060
00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:30,769
I'm just a kid, you're
not gonna ruin my life.

1061
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:31,937
I know I just think that you should

1062
00:59:31,947 --> 00:59:34,614
probably kiss guys your own age.

1063
00:59:35,275 --> 00:59:39,025
Okay well, guys my age don't even kiss you,

1064
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:41,969
they skip that, straight for a boob grab.

1065
00:59:41,979 --> 00:59:42,803
Oh yeah?

1066
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:44,145
Yeah, oh yeah.

1067
00:59:46,453 --> 00:59:48,075
Whatever it's no big deal.

1068
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:52,252
Just heard that old guys
really take their time so.

1069
00:59:52,917 --> 00:59:55,167
I don't think so Caitlin.

1070
00:59:57,477 --> 01:00:01,060
Did you have a girlfriend in high school?

1071
01:00:03,605 --> 01:00:05,105
Did you guys kiss?

1072
01:00:06,037 --> 01:00:08,787
Of course yeah, yeah we kissed.

1073
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:12,256
Well do you want to just maybe

1074
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:17,152
kiss me like you would kiss her.

1075
01:00:42,709 --> 01:00:44,376
Like that?

1076
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:47,187
Yeah, that's really good.

1077
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:51,855
Well you got your kiss.

1078
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:53,865
Wasn't so hard was it?

1079
01:00:54,313 --> 01:00:55,313
No.

1080
01:00:56,776 --> 01:00:59,526
So who were you thinking about?

1081
01:00:59,769 --> 01:01:00,592
What do you mean?

1082
01:01:00,602 --> 01:01:01,426
The high school girlfriend that

1083
01:01:01,436 --> 01:01:03,983
you were thinking about when you kissed me.

1084
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:04,826
Becca.

1085
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:05,873
Becca?

1086
01:01:05,975 --> 01:01:06,799
Yeah.

1087
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:08,308
Becca, the slut.

1088
01:01:09,185 --> 01:01:12,185
No she was great, she was awesome.

1089
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:15,966
And she loved me a lot.

1090
01:01:18,033 --> 01:01:21,271
How come you guys aren't still together?

1091
01:01:21,281 --> 01:01:22,531
I don't know.

1092
01:01:23,393 --> 01:01:27,393
I mean it was a different
lifetime ago you know.

1093
01:01:27,616 --> 01:01:30,199
Oh please, not that long ago.

1094
01:01:32,049 --> 01:01:35,703
I mean I now I pretended like
you're 100, but not that.

1095
01:01:35,713 --> 01:01:38,087
No you'll understand I mean.

1096
01:01:38,097 --> 01:01:41,514
You don't understand it now but you will.

1097
01:01:42,705 --> 01:01:44,007
Do you love her?

1098
01:01:44,017 --> 01:01:46,850
You look like you really love her.

1099
01:01:49,329 --> 01:01:51,496
I do, yeah I guess I do.

1100
01:01:53,553 --> 01:01:55,386
Just go be with her.

1101
01:01:58,353 --> 01:01:59,655
You know it's really hard to argue with

1102
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:01,332
that logic of yours.

1103
01:02:01,777 --> 01:02:05,360
I know I'm like really smart, I told you.

1104
01:02:10,912 --> 01:02:12,773
I don't know, I don't want to know.

1105
01:02:12,783 --> 01:02:14,366
Do you hear that?

1106
01:02:14,561 --> 01:02:17,228
I'm trying really hard not to.

1107
01:02:24,321 --> 01:02:25,904
By girls.

1108
01:02:32,241 --> 01:02:35,923
Can you believe we used to
take these moments for granted?

1109
01:02:35,933 --> 01:02:38,295
Seems like forever ago man.

1110
01:02:38,305 --> 01:02:39,911
Man I'd really appreciate it

1111
01:02:39,921 --> 01:02:42,921
if you'd keep this night between us.

1112
01:02:43,089 --> 01:02:44,089
Sure yeah.

1113
01:02:44,817 --> 01:02:46,984
Dude I'm not crazy okay.

1114
01:02:47,201 --> 01:02:51,034
I know this isn't a world
I can just run into.

1115
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:54,028
I just need an escape sometimes.

1116
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:56,750
You gonna be alright?

1117
01:02:57,681 --> 01:02:59,681
Yeah, yeah you'll see.

1118
01:03:16,641 --> 01:03:19,724
Alright, don't be a fucking stranger.

1119
01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:21,696
Same to you.

1120
01:03:24,416 --> 01:03:27,670
Well do you know what you're gonna do now?

1121
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,513
Dude I have no idea.

1122
01:03:30,081 --> 01:03:34,248
Well when you figure it
out give me a call okay.

1123
01:03:34,337 --> 01:03:35,337
I will.

1124
01:03:35,985 --> 01:03:36,985
Alright.

1125
01:03:38,697 --> 01:03:40,530
Stay out of trouble.

1126
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:43,400
Get the fuck out of my truck.

1127
01:03:45,705 --> 01:03:46,705
Thanks.

1128
01:03:58,153 --> 01:03:59,153
Morning.

1129
01:03:59,209 --> 01:04:00,209
Morning.

1130
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:03,208
Is that Tommy?

1131
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:05,761
Yeah.

1132
01:04:06,793 --> 01:04:08,960
I see he hasn't changed.

1133
01:04:09,593 --> 01:04:10,593
Nope.

1134
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:13,726
You want some pancakes?

1135
01:04:13,736 --> 01:04:14,736
Yeah.

1136
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:27,478
Did you have a fun night?

1137
01:04:28,317 --> 01:04:29,650
Yeah not bad.

1138
01:04:31,005 --> 01:04:34,338
You didn't do anything stupid did you?

1139
01:04:34,762 --> 01:04:36,512
No more than usual.

1140
01:04:37,867 --> 01:04:40,243
That's what I was worried about.

1141
01:04:40,253 --> 01:04:44,083
Do you have plans
for what you wanna do next?

1142
01:04:44,093 --> 01:04:45,093
Nope.

1143
01:04:47,437 --> 01:04:50,687
Well, we all know that this is sudden

1144
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:56,292
and it'll take some time for
you to figure things out.

1145
01:04:59,421 --> 01:05:00,739
Is there a but coming?

1146
01:05:00,749 --> 01:05:04,916
No there's not but, we
just want you to be happy.

1147
01:05:05,453 --> 01:05:06,453
I know.

1148
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:10,955
And if you need a place to stay

1149
01:05:11,117 --> 01:05:13,950
you can move back here for awhile.

1150
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:16,361
What?

1151
01:05:16,817 --> 01:05:18,317
What's so funny?

1152
01:05:18,897 --> 01:05:22,730
No I mean I appreciate
the offer really but,

1153
01:05:27,537 --> 01:05:30,820
I mean honestly I'd rather be
homeless than move back here.

1154
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:32,375
Well what kind of statement is that?

1155
01:05:32,385 --> 01:05:34,218
I'm just saying Mom,

1156
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:38,167
I'm not gonna be moving
back home, like ever.

1157
01:05:39,745 --> 01:05:42,695
Well it's not a big deal
people do it all the time.

1158
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:43,558
Okay well if that's the case then

1159
01:05:43,568 --> 01:05:46,567
you can clean my bloody
brains off of my bedroom wall.

1160
01:05:46,577 --> 01:05:47,410
Riley!

1161
01:05:47,585 --> 01:05:49,418
Honey, he's kidding.

1162
01:05:50,897 --> 01:05:52,814
Tell her you're joking.

1163
01:05:53,777 --> 01:05:54,839
Of course I'm joking I'm not gonna

1164
01:05:54,849 --> 01:05:57,253
blow my brains out in my bedroom.

1165
01:05:57,263 --> 01:05:58,693
Well I should hope not.

1166
01:05:58,703 --> 01:06:02,536
Okay so then just tell
us what you wanna do?

1167
01:06:03,473 --> 01:06:04,473
Well,

1168
01:06:07,409 --> 01:06:08,992
what about Roxanne?

1169
01:06:09,025 --> 01:06:10,442
What about her?

1170
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:12,634
Is she still around?

1171
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,988
There she is, she's as beautiful as ever.

1172
01:06:21,998 --> 01:06:22,998
Oh my God.

1173
01:06:25,713 --> 01:06:27,319
I can't believe you still have her.

1174
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:29,831
Well it's not for lack of trying.

1175
01:06:29,841 --> 01:06:32,423
Nobody will buy the damn thing.

1176
01:06:32,433 --> 01:06:33,766
She still run?

1177
01:06:33,793 --> 01:06:34,960
Fire her up.

1178
01:06:50,085 --> 01:06:52,475
Oh I don't feel good
about you driving this car.

1179
01:06:52,485 --> 01:06:54,699
What if it dies on you out there?

1180
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:56,709
If she dies, she dies.

1181
01:06:58,005 --> 01:06:59,172
I'm serious.

1182
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:02,635
I'll figure it out as
I go along, I always do.

1183
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:04,645
So where you gonna go?

1184
01:07:05,781 --> 01:07:07,448
Wherever I end up.

1185
01:07:08,181 --> 01:07:12,095
Okay well call us when you
find out where you're going.

1186
01:07:12,105 --> 01:07:13,105
I will.

1187
01:07:13,401 --> 01:07:14,384
Okay, love you.

1188
01:07:14,394 --> 01:07:15,810
I love you too.

1189
01:07:16,329 --> 01:07:17,329
By Dad.

1190
01:07:19,705 --> 01:07:21,122
Oh honey.

1191
01:07:21,321 --> 01:07:22,176
See you around.

1192
01:07:22,186 --> 01:07:23,435
Drive safely.

1193
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,607
Why did you let him drive that car?

1194
01:07:26,617 --> 01:07:27,441
He's a good boy.

1195
01:07:27,451 --> 01:07:28,873
Okay fine.

1196
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:25,875
Jesus Christ.

1197
01:09:45,018 --> 01:09:46,018
Hey Becca.

1198
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:47,490
Riley?

1199
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,970
What are you doing here?

1200
01:09:51,082 --> 01:09:53,499
I was just passing through.

1201
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:58,576
I heard you lived here and I
got your address from your mom.

1202
01:09:58,586 --> 01:10:00,419
I hope that's alright.

1203
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:02,404
Yeah, yeah it's okay.

1204
01:10:04,552 --> 01:10:06,635
Just a little surprising.

1205
01:10:07,226 --> 01:10:10,336
I should of called, sorry that was rude.

1206
01:10:10,346 --> 01:10:11,846
No no it's fine.

1207
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:18,897
I can't believe you're here
standing on my front porch.

1208
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:23,310
It's been a long time.

1209
01:10:23,933 --> 01:10:24,933
Yeah.

1210
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:28,317
How are you?

1211
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:33,567
I don't know, I don't know.

1212
01:10:37,342 --> 01:10:39,925
Well listen I'm gonna be here

1213
01:10:40,046 --> 01:10:42,580
for the next couple of days so,

1214
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,884
if you ever want to go out for a drink

1215
01:10:44,894 --> 01:10:47,311
or anything just let me know.

1216
01:10:49,338 --> 01:10:51,505
You want to have dinner?

1217
01:10:52,542 --> 01:10:53,542
Dinner?

1218
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:56,292
Tomorrow, does that work?

1219
01:10:56,302 --> 01:10:57,302
Or now?

1220
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:59,886
Like now now you mean?

1221
01:11:00,542 --> 01:11:01,542
Yeah.

1222
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:04,384
If you want to.

1223
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:11,537
What's for dinner?

1224
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:12,713
Okay, okay.

1225
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,730
Whoa, holy shit.

1226
01:11:18,318 --> 01:11:19,572
Tommy made those little cheat sheets.

1227
01:11:19,582 --> 01:11:22,788
They were like this small
with six font you know.

1228
01:11:22,798 --> 01:11:25,060
He made a lot of money selling those.

1229
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:27,570
That went better than expected.

1230
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:28,404
Are they down?

1231
01:11:28,414 --> 01:11:30,820
Down well, Kyle's down I think

1232
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:33,580
Robin will follow shortly I hope.

1233
01:11:33,628 --> 01:11:34,452
Thank you.

1234
01:11:34,462 --> 01:11:36,180
They're very very cute kids.

1235
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:39,012
Well that's all her doing I'm afraid.

1236
01:11:39,022 --> 01:11:41,924
I might be responsible
for their stubbornness

1237
01:11:41,934 --> 01:11:45,107
a bit and that's about
all they get from me.

1238
01:11:45,117 --> 01:11:47,684
So what were you guys talking about?

1239
01:11:47,694 --> 01:11:49,074
Oh just high school.

1240
01:11:49,084 --> 01:11:49,908
High school.

1241
01:11:49,918 --> 01:11:51,626
High school, so you guys knew each other

1242
01:11:51,636 --> 01:11:52,619
pretty well in high school right?

1243
01:11:52,629 --> 01:11:54,711
Yeah yeah, pretty well.

1244
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:58,202
Well good 'cause Becca
never talks about high school.

1245
01:11:58,212 --> 01:12:00,166
So I have some questions.

1246
01:12:00,176 --> 01:12:04,259
Was she a righteous dork
like she is still today?

1247
01:12:04,499 --> 01:12:05,499
Shut up.

1248
01:12:05,912 --> 01:12:07,710
Yeah something like that.

1249
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,662
Oh you're one to talk.

1250
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:13,839
Nah she was very nice,
funny, everybody liked her.

1251
01:12:14,328 --> 01:12:15,902
Except Patrick Skinner.

1252
01:12:15,912 --> 01:12:18,995
Yes Patrick, that was an exception.

1253
01:12:19,512 --> 01:12:23,006
Oh yeah and what was the
deal with Patrick Skinner?

1254
01:12:23,016 --> 01:12:26,542
He used to hold her down against her will

1255
01:12:26,552 --> 01:12:30,635
and he would tickle her
like pretty aggressively.

1256
01:12:32,487 --> 01:12:33,998
One of those guys huh?

1257
01:12:34,008 --> 01:12:36,846
Yeah well he got what was coming to him.

1258
01:12:36,856 --> 01:12:38,286
And what was that?

1259
01:12:38,296 --> 01:12:40,094
Riley beat him up after school

1260
01:12:40,104 --> 01:12:42,604
in the Jiffy Trip parking lot.

1261
01:12:42,616 --> 01:12:46,616
Allegedly, that theory
hasn't been proven yet.

1262
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:49,630
Oh hello, if you wanted to keep it a secret

1263
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,670
you probably shouldn't have done it

1264
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,782
in front of Tommy who told Missy.

1265
01:12:52,792 --> 01:12:54,686
And we all know Missy can't keep a secret

1266
01:12:54,696 --> 01:12:58,863
'cause she called me and told
me before the blood was dry.

1267
01:13:01,272 --> 01:13:03,189
You did that for her?

1268
01:13:04,168 --> 01:13:05,168
Allegedly.

1269
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,687
So how about boyfriends?

1270
01:13:12,104 --> 01:13:13,694
Did she have a lot of them?

1271
01:13:13,704 --> 01:13:15,287
No, just the one.

1272
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,174
Oh yeah, and what was he like?

1273
01:13:22,184 --> 01:13:23,351
Total idiot.

1274
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,716
Don't tell me you had to beat him up too.

1275
01:13:26,726 --> 01:13:29,309
I probably should of.

1276
01:13:29,592 --> 01:13:33,759
High school just feels like
a million years ago you know.

1277
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,460
Feels like it was just yesterday for me.

1278
01:13:42,536 --> 01:13:45,619
So Riley what brings you to Denver?

1279
01:13:46,064 --> 01:13:47,981
Just passing through.

1280
01:13:48,512 --> 01:13:49,512
I see.

1281
01:13:50,432 --> 01:13:52,262
And passing through form where?

1282
01:13:52,272 --> 01:13:53,750
Where do you live?

1283
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,927
I used to live in Chicago,
but I recently moved.

1284
01:13:59,024 --> 01:14:00,024
Really?

1285
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,613
What made you leave Chicago?

1286
01:14:05,216 --> 01:14:07,799
My marriage ended so you know

1287
01:14:11,216 --> 01:14:13,716
I've been making some changes.

1288
01:14:14,228 --> 01:14:15,478
I'm so sorry.

1289
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:20,187
Yeah that's, sorry to hear,
that's never easy on anyone.

1290
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:26,442
So what are you gonna do now?

1291
01:14:28,132 --> 01:14:32,132
I don't know, I gotta
kind of figure that out.

1292
01:14:33,204 --> 01:14:34,458
Well I admire you.

1293
01:14:34,468 --> 01:14:38,635
It takes a lot of courage to
just start all over again.

1294
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:44,747
Courage or stupidity, I
haven't figured that out yet.

1295
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:53,740
Good coffee.

1296
01:14:55,204 --> 01:14:56,537
It's a Keurig.

1297
01:14:58,724 --> 01:15:00,234
Well Riley it was great to meet you.

1298
01:15:00,244 --> 01:15:02,522
And you know what any friend
of Becca's is a friend of mine.

1299
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:04,202
Likewise, thanks for dinner.

1300
01:15:04,212 --> 01:15:05,642
Everything was great, appreciate it.

1301
01:15:05,652 --> 01:15:08,985
You got it thanks, any time.

1302
01:15:09,012 --> 01:15:11,210
I'm just gonna walk him to the car.

1303
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,220
Okay.

1304
01:15:13,012 --> 01:15:14,012
Night.

1305
01:15:18,084 --> 01:15:21,167
Oh my God, you still have Roxeanne.

1306
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:23,914
You remembered her name.

1307
01:15:23,924 --> 01:15:26,234
Of course I did, I spent more time

1308
01:15:26,244 --> 01:15:29,210
in this piece of shit than
I did in my own bedroom.

1309
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:30,953
Hey take it easy on here okay.

1310
01:15:30,963 --> 01:15:32,218
She's been through a lot.

1311
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:36,395
Yeah I know, you stole my
virginity in the back seat.

1312
01:15:37,652 --> 01:15:40,510
I, I think It was the other way around.

1313
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:43,603
Oh please you begged me to take it.

1314
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,110
I don't remember you
putting up much of a fight.

1315
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,846
Well I guess that's the problem growing up

1316
01:15:48,856 --> 01:15:53,023
in a small town, get bored
enough to try anything.

1317
01:15:53,835 --> 01:15:56,668
Well thank you, appreciate that.

1318
01:15:57,534 --> 01:15:58,486
Guess it wasn't all bad.

1319
01:15:58,496 --> 01:15:59,496
Nah.

1320
01:16:03,328 --> 01:16:05,813
What are you really doing here?

1321
01:16:05,823 --> 01:16:07,406
What do you mean?

1322
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,573
Come on Riley.

1323
01:16:10,943 --> 01:16:12,918
We haven't talked for
years and you just show up

1324
01:16:12,928 --> 01:16:15,761
on my front porch out of the blue.

1325
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,937
Why are you here?

1326
01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:24,249
I don't know I mean,

1327
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,734
don't you ever think about us?

1328
01:16:29,744 --> 01:16:31,494
What could have been?

1329
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,038
Riley don't do this to yourself.

1330
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:35,048
Do what?

1331
01:16:36,367 --> 01:16:39,110
Listen I know your divorce
is still pretty fresh

1332
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,953
but I, you can't just show up here

1333
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,390
and start up shit like
nothing ever happened.

1334
01:16:47,392 --> 01:16:49,475
I have a family in there.

1335
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,627
This is my life now.

1336
01:16:54,912 --> 01:16:55,912
I know.

1337
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:02,031
I just wanted to see you in your life.

1338
01:17:04,591 --> 01:17:05,591
I'm sorry.

1339
01:17:07,568 --> 01:17:10,054
You called me right before my wedding.

1340
01:17:10,064 --> 01:17:11,814
That was a mistake.

1341
01:17:11,984 --> 01:17:12,887
I shouldn't have don't that.

1342
01:17:12,897 --> 01:17:14,086
Why did you do it?

1343
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:17,429
Why didn't you tell me to not marry her?

1344
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,284
You sounded so happy on the phone.

1345
01:17:21,294 --> 01:17:25,461
Yeah I was happy because
I was talking to you okay.

1346
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:30,677
You should go.

1347
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,367
I'm staying at the Hampton
Inn down the road, room 312.

1348
01:17:50,756 --> 01:17:54,923
I wouldn't have married
her if you told me not to.

1349
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:58,213
I just want you to know that.

1350
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,500
Hi.

1351
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,530
What's wrong?

1352
01:20:01,344 --> 01:20:02,427
Everything.

1353
01:20:08,895 --> 01:20:12,728
I can make this work
for you, you know that?

1354
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,440
I know.

1355
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:17,880
But I can't.

1356
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,973
What do you want me to do?

1357
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:39,602
Just hold me for a little bit longer.

1358
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:25,555
There comes a moment

1359
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:29,061
in every man's life where
he must make a choice

1360
01:22:29,071 --> 01:22:31,365
and decide to push forward and forge ahead

1361
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:33,093
with the path he's chosen hoping

1362
01:22:33,103 --> 01:22:35,253
that eventually something rights itself

1363
01:22:35,263 --> 01:22:38,263
and everything works out in the end.

1364
01:22:38,895 --> 01:22:41,812
Or this man can decide to jump ship

1365
01:22:42,701 --> 01:22:44,100
into the murky cloudy waters of

1366
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:46,629
the unknown on the remote chance that

1367
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:49,639
there's something greater out there.

1368
01:22:57,519 --> 01:23:01,686
Maybe today is the day I take
a chance at something greater.

1369
01:23:07,727 --> 01:23:11,060
Maybe today is the day I decide to jump.
