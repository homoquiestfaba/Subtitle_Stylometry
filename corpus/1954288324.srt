1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,974
Okay, are you ready?

2
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,227
Yeah. I'm ready.

3
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,230
I can't believe I'm gonna
do it with my babysitter.

4
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,651
Ex-babysitter. Hunter, can you
not bring that up right now?

5
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,654
- Sorry, sorry.
- It's okay.

6
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,742
I think I popped your cherry on
Tuesday, so it shouldn't hurt too bad.

7
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,828
Oh, okay, good.

8
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,916
Are you okay?

9
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,794
Keep going.

10
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,810
Those are all Audrey's.

11
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,396
It's a lot.

12
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,398
That's mine.

13
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,069
That's cool.

14
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,912
Audrey lost it when
we were only like 15.

15
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,749
She snuck in one night,
wasted on Zima...

16
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:11,548
and was all like, "I just lost it while
we listened to 'Kiss From a Rose.'"

17
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,385
I gotta jet.

18
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,262
Trig quiz first period.

19
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,100
Things aren't gonna
be weird now, right?

20
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,728
No. I don't know.

21
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,272
Okay. Yeah.

22
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:32,027
So are we like boyfriend
and girlfriend now or...?

23
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,240
You are so funny.

24
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,244
Happy birthday.

25
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,136
Pop.

26
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,213
- Happy birthday, porcupine.
- Thank you, Daddy.

27
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,317
You wanna fix that mouth.

28
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,403
It's too...

29
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,738
happy.

30
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:07,080
I put the cake in the kitchen. Need some
hands getting the booze out the car.

31
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,581
Let me take a look at you.

32
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,792
Give me a little something.

33
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,879
Oh, and happy birthday, you.

34
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,715
I've got a present for you.

35
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,384
I'm gonna take you to see
Rhonda at the salon.

36
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:23,805
Take a yard or two off that hair, little
lipstick, you'll look just like Audrey.

37
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,182
We are identical twins, May.

38
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:31,730
Oh, I know, honey, but it's the details that
matter when it comes to roping in a fella.

39
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,335
Happy birthday, LaLu.

40
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,303
- Hey, Dad.
- Audrey.

41
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,849
Anyway.

42
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,811
You want your present?

43
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,401
- "Audrey."
- So you'll always have me with you.

44
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,655
Come here.

45
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,242
Happy birthday.

46
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,411
A dollhouse?

47
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,747
No, look inside.

48
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,376
- What is it?
- Hang on a second.

49
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,885
Oh, my God.

50
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,514
I can't believe it. Look at us.

51
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,059
This is so brilliant.

52
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,269
Just like you.

53
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,691
It's so you can always feel
at home whenever you're away.

54
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,527
Laurel, I love it.

55
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,876
So how does it feel being
all grown up, ladies?

56
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,211
Oh, it's great.

57
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,172
Nobody really takes you
seriously in your early 20s.

58
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,217
- It's much better for business.
- What sort of business?

59
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,722
I work at a boutique real-estate company
that specializes in storybook homes.

60
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,390
Come again?

61
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:35,061
Houses that look like hobbit
holes or witches' dens or...

62
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,814
People sure do like to
play pretend, I guess.

63
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,399
What are you up to, Laurel?

64
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,277
Still helping our dad with
those forgeries he makes.

65
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,779
They're not forgeries,
they're copies.

66
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,240
Oh, right. No, copies.
Yes, I'm sorry.

67
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,076
Laurel's an amazing painter.

68
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,747
I just finished a
cross-stitch of my Canoodle.

69
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:58,001
- I'll have to bring it by before you leave.
- Yes, sure. That'll be great.

70
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,627
Bye.

71
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,505
- Happy birthday, ladies.
- Thank you.

72
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,008
- Hunter.
- Hunter.

73
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,677
Yeah. Are you a model now?

74
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,346
No.

75
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,557
You could easily be a model.

76
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,772
Hunter, can I speak with you
for a moment in the kitchen?

77
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,068
Yeah, sure. After you.

78
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,904
Nice seeing you again.

79
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,868
What is wrong, babe?

80
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,581
Please don't look at my sister
like you wanna lick her face.

81
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,249
Babe, Laurel.

82
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,669
You know I only have eyes for you.

83
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,422
Stop. Stop. You know
this isn't right...

84
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,342
Hunter! What are you doing?

85
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,846
That's your babysitter.

86
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,603
Sorry, everybody, party's over.

87
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,234
Laurel!

88
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,613
Will you come down here, please?

89
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:28,341
I just didn't wanna be
a virgin forever...

90
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,928
waiting for some fairy-tale
guy who doesn't exist.

91
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,223
You need to get out of this place.

92
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,269
You're screwing a minor...

93
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,397
and you act like Dad's wife, Laurel.
It's fucked.

94
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:48,361
Hunter is almost 18. And I
don't act like Dad's wife.

95
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,906
You cook for him,
you clean for him.

96
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,577
And you wear all of our
dead mother's old clothes.

97
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:59,039
I mean, do you even have
a dress of your own?

98
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,334
Wearing her clothes makes me
feel like she's still around.

99
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:09,007
- You've held on long enough, Laurel.
- Well, after Mom died, you just left.

100
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,301
Somebody had to take
care of everything.

101
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,220
Laurel, Dad is a grown man.

102
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,972
He doesn't need you.

103
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,268
He can't even get ice
cubes out of the trays.

104
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,149
I'm really sorry for
ruining our birthday.

105
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,235
I don't care about our birthday.

106
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,904
I care about you.

107
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,741
You deserve better than this.

108
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,994
I want you to move in with me.

109
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,249
Really?

110
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,096
But he'll never let me go.

111
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,849
I'm taking Laurel to
live with me, Dad.

112
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,064
Okay.

113
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,239
Good talk.

114
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,078
I don't see the point in going with you.
My loser-ness is just...

115
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:24,040
too painfully obvious
when I'm with you.

116
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,545
Listen...

117
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,464
we have the same DNA, Laurel.

118
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:37,387
And despite the story
you've made up about me...

119
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,890
- ...I don't have everything figured out.
- Yeah, right.

120
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,102
You'll see.

121
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,064
But what would I do?

122
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,066
Paint.

123
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,070
Dad's always fixing
my work, I can't.

124
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,032
You're coming home with me...

125
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,118
you're gonna do your own
painting, and that is that.

126
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:05,206
But you cannot come home with me...

127
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,376
with all of this coming
out of your head.

128
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,962
- My hair?
- Yeah.

129
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,048
Makeover.

130
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,388
Who is Charles?

131
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,390
No one.

132
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,353
You didn't tell me you
were dating someone.

133
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,813
I don't wanna talk about it.

134
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,569
- Fire drill!
- No.

135
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,238
Come on, don't be such an old lady!

136
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:42,160
Laurel, you're gonna
miss your appointment.

137
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,538
No.

138
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:04,557
- I am going to go buy you a dress.
- Okay.

139
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,727
So did you bring a
picture or something?

140
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,729
Well, what do you wanna look like?

141
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,484
Her, I guess?

142
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,904
Okay, we'll give it a try.

143
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:23,702
Laurel, they had pretty
slim pickings, but...

144
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,879
Wait, are you guys twins?

145
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,928
I like the dress so much,
it's really sweet.

146
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,267
Look, I thought you wanted
me to be more like you.

147
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,396
I want you to be like you, Laurel.

148
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:52,897
Like you.

149
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:58,945
I mean, I figured it looks good on you,
so it's gonna look all right on me.

150
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,823
Dad is gonna freak out when
he sees you like that.

151
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,286
I know, we haven't had the same
haircut since before Mom died.

152
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,960
Seriously, I'm so glad no one
is around when we do that.

153
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,255
So do I get to meet your boyfriend?

154
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:21,426
- Fire drill!
- Hey, hey, no fair.

155
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,012
Don't change the subject.

156
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,608
- Hey, seat belts.
- Who needs a seat belt?

157
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,151
I have a hair belt.

158
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,666
Can you show me two fingers?

159
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,715
My sister.

160
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,425
She...

161
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,436
She passed.

162
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,734
You were in a head-on collision,
she was driving, you...

163
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,572
You went through the windshield.

164
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,996
Can I see her?

165
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,919
There was a fire.
There's nothing to see.

166
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,220
That's her.

167
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,601
That's her!

168
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,646
You're twins.

169
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,273
That's you, Audrey.

170
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,486
Audrey?

171
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,155
That's your name.

172
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,824
What's the last thing you remember?

173
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,709
The party.

174
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,798
Injuries like this, people lose
everything around the accident.

175
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,384
When is she gonna
remember who she is?

176
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,054
She has post-traumatic amnesia.
It's not structural or permanent.

177
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:15,058
She should get her bearings in a few
days once the swelling goes down.

178
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,893
We should monitor her closely.

179
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,856
She could have lingering memory
problems, difficulty speaking....

180
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,673
We'll bring her home after
supper, get her situated.

181
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,094
I'm gonna make a Jell-O
mold for the reception...

182
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,180
the kind with the
floating fruit in it.

183
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,435
Laurel told me it made
her feel peaceful.

184
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,897
It reminded her of
floating in outer space.

185
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,876
May called your work to let
them know what happened.

186
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,545
What do I do?

187
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,049
You're in real estate, honey.

188
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,717
I called Claudia.

189
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:34,054
She's coming tomorrow
with her boyfriend.

190
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,890
Claudia?

191
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,517
Your best friend.

192
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,312
You want me to call anyone else?

193
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,731
No.

194
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,236
I don't want her to come.

195
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,573
I don't want anyone to come.

196
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,539
Let us know if you need anything.

197
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,876
We leave for the service
first thing in the morning.

198
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,537
Laurel's funeral is this morning.

199
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,545
Mama...

200
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,010
I wish you were here.

201
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,286
My funeral.

202
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:25,373
Oh, no, no, no. My funeral...
My funeral is this morning.

203
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,625
My funeral.

204
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,255
Hi.

205
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,507
How are you feeling this morning?

206
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,927
- I'm not... I'm okay. I...
- That's just great.

207
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,388
I was just telling your father...

208
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,099
you've always been
a very strong girl.

209
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,727
And I know it'll be rough going...

210
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,855
but I just know you'll
find some way to triumph.

211
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,774
- Thanks. I...
- And Laurel...

212
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,068
she was such a strange little bird.

213
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,903
Never got over your mama...

214
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,740
and I just don't think she
could've got past losing you too.

215
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,201
It's just better that
it happened this way.

216
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,376
Oh, I'm sorry.

217
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,337
I didn't mean to upset you.

218
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:15,590
What was it you were
gonna tell us, honey?

219
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,012
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm not really...

220
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm actually not...

221
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,773
I'm just starting to remember
some things, and...

222
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,401
That's just fantastic, honey.

223
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,820
That's great news.

224
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,198
Great.

225
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:43,243
Yup, it's great, really great.

226
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,328
Great news.

227
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:17,318
Would anyone like to say a
few parting words to Laurel?

228
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,788
A shared moment, perhaps?

229
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,042
Anything?

230
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,711
Frank?

231
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,761
Audrey?

232
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,894
It's too bad...

233
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:56,066
that Laurel never got a chance
to get out of this place...

234
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,445
since she clearly meant
shit to all of you people.

235
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:02,572
And you know, it's
really too bad...

236
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:08,244
that I was the only one who ever saw
anything special in her or believed in her.

237
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:14,709
And now that she's gone, you
assholes can't hurt her anymore!

238
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:30,100
What are you doing here? My parents
are gonna flip if they see you.

239
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,787
I knew you knew. I knew you knew.

240
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,706
I felt... I thought...

241
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,708
I didn't know,
but I felt something.

242
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,627
I just realized it this morning.

243
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,548
I've been dreaming of this
moment since I was like 10.

244
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,718
What?

245
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:10,807
I.... I've been in love with you
since the fourth grade, Audrey.

246
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:14,477
I mean, she looked like
you, but she wasn't...

247
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,812
She wasn't you.

248
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,901
I don't understand. You kissed me.

249
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,738
You were her only friend.
She loved you.

250
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,868
Well, yeah, but I liked her too.
Don't get me wrong.

251
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,703
It's just that...

252
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,080
You're...

253
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,124
You're a goddess.

254
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,182
Audrey.

255
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,893
It's chilly out here, come inside.

256
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,812
She took care of you
for all those years.

257
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,774
How could you not say anything?

258
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,402
- Let's take this inside.
- Yeah.

259
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:07,030
"Let's take it inside.
Let's take it inside."

260
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:10,158
God forbid we should ever say
anything about how we feel!

261
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:14,496
Dad, say something.

262
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,501
Right now. Just say something!

263
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:21,711
Say something!

264
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,578
I have to go back to work.

265
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,997
In the shape you're in?

266
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:42,083
I'll follow up with
my doctors at home.

267
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,753
What should we do
with all her things?

268
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,172
Donate them, I don't care.

269
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:49,799
She didn't have anything anyway.

270
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,384
Wait.

271
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,636
I've got something for you.

272
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:07,400
What about all those other paintings?
What are you gonna do with those?

273
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,945
Which other paintings?

274
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,580
These are all Laurel's.

275
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,875
I couldn't send them to customers.

276
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,044
They're not quite right.

277
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,881
You can take as many
of them as you like.

278
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:31,925
I can't use them.

279
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:36,596
No, that's okay.

280
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:39,724
I'll just take the one.

281
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,471
Three fives.

282
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,932
- You got a draw?
- Yeah.

283
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,308
Good this far?

284
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,561
I got three ones...

285
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:28,064
but just because of that lucky
draw I was telling you about.

286
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:31,609
- Then how about 10, 11, 12, 13?
- Great.

287
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,239
Hey, what are you doing?

288
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,909
Leave Basel alone.
He doesn't want to move out.

289
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,746
Timor, I can handle this.
You want me to move out...

290
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,498
pay me a move-out fee.
It's the way it works.

291
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:48,710
- The law is on the tenant's side.
- Oh, you're my tenant.

292
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:54,507
- Yeah.
- Sorry, I got in an accident.

293
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,051
I....

294
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,178
I have post-traumatic amnesia.

295
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,557
I've never met a real-life amnesiac.
Cool.

296
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,726
- Dinner!
- Oh, that's my mom.

297
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,227
- Yup.
- Can I take this one?

298
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,730
Yeah. You're gonna have
it back in two weeks?

299
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,982
- I guess.
- All right. Perfect.

300
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:12,776
Thanks, buddy.

301
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,111
- Good playing.
- You too.

302
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,822
- Bye.
- All right, bye.

303
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:23,578
Why did I wanna kick you out?

304
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,748
So your sister can move in here.

305
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,585
- That was nice of me.
- It was.

306
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:33,421
Except for when you called
me a creepy man-child...

307
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:36,341
and tried to kick me out.
That was less nice.

308
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:42,472
Well, so my sister will not be moving in
because of extenuating circumstances...

309
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,933
so you don't have to leave.

310
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,018
No, really?

311
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:49,437
Oh, thank you, Audrey.

312
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:55,944
Books.

313
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:57,946
Yes, these are books.

314
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,533
Yeah, I sell these books online...

315
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,911
and I lend them to people in
the neighborhood, mostly kids.

316
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:08,081
You wanna borrow one?
Help yourself.

317
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,960
I broke my arm once,
so I can relate to that.

318
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:17,882
Do you wanna sign
my cast, whatever?

319
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,886
- You okay?
- Yeah, I mean you don't have to...

320
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:23,680
No, no, please. I'd like to.

321
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,683
I was thinking something like,
I don't know:

322
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:30,020
"I hate you. Love, Basel."

323
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:33,106
How about "I hate you.
Hate, Basel"?

324
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,774
That's better. You improved.

325
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:38,611
There you go.

326
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,118
You okay? You seem
really different.

327
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,996
I do? No.

328
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:49,247
Like how?

329
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,416
Well, you're being nice to me.

330
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:54,294
Whatever.

331
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,673
Audrey, that's your phone ringing.

332
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,093
You should probably answer it.

333
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:04,387
Right. Cool.

334
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:05,597
Cool.

335
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,390
Cool.

336
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:10,977
- You live right over there.
- Right, okay.

337
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,375
Hello?

338
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:39,297
Hi, Charles. Charles.

339
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:41,049
Hi.

340
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:46,388
Yeah. I'm okay.

341
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,600
Yeah, sure.

342
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:56,398
Can you remind me what
our place is again?

343
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,862
Okay. Great.

344
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:07,075
I'll just remember that.
Yes, I'll see you there.

345
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,412
I love you too.

346
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,331
Bye.

347
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,860
- It's me, Claudia.
- Come in.

348
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:43,903
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

349
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,239
Oh, my God.

350
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,533
This was on the porch.

351
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,035
Oh, sorry.

352
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:51,745
I just talked to your dad.

353
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,456
Do you remember me?
He said you might not.

354
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:56,541
- No, yes, I remember.
- Okay, good.

355
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,878
He said your phone melted
in the accident, literally melted.

356
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:02,464
I made you my egg-white meringue.

357
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,716
How are you? I mean
really, how are you?

358
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:07,886
I'm okay. Yeah, you know,
a little turned around.

359
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,596
Yeah.

360
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:12,098
- Did you do something to your hair?
- No.

361
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:16,061
- Just a... Yeah, a little trim.
- Yeah.

362
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:17,771
Everyone in the office knows.

363
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:21,399
Edith says take as much
bereavement as you need.

364
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:23,526
You don't have to refrigerate that.

365
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:25,987
What is that smell?

366
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,448
I don't know.

367
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:32,452
- Maybe the flowers.
- Yeah, okay.

368
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:37,415
Whoa, yes.

369
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:44,589
You know, I'm really great
to go back to work.

370
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:47,550
I really want to, you know,
just get back to normal...

371
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:49,678
I hear that.

372
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:54,641
Back to normal, great idea, but maybe
you should consider not going back...

373
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:58,311
until it looks like you didn't
just go through a windshield.

374
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,336
They're so perfect they seem fake.

375
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:26,715
It's like they're in
Technicolor or something.

376
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:30,385
Don't know their real names,
so I call them The Browns.

377
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:33,888
Mr. and Mrs. Brown, and
their kids, Dick and Jane.

378
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,223
Dick and Jane, yeah.

379
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,434
I didn't think of naming the kids.

380
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,685
Right...

381
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:42,063
Hey. We're just talking
about the Browns together.

382
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:44,482
Fascinating.

383
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:46,192
Okay, ready?

384
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,402
Oh, sure.

385
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:50,739
Do you want me to call Hortensia?
Get this place cleaned up?

386
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,544
Audrey?

387
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:06,629
Oh, yeah, hi.

388
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:10,800
Yes, nice meeting you...
To see you.

389
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,761
I'm so...

390
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,097
so, so, so sorry.

391
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:19,934
- I know how much she meant to you.
- You do?

392
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,151
I think our table is ready.

393
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,882
So this place is super
close to my apartment.

394
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,426
Yes.

395
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,720
Yes, it is.

396
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,934
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

397
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:04,104
You know, I just don't
really feel like myself.

398
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,606
I don't remember a lot of things.

399
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:11,236
It's okay. We'll take it slow.

400
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:16,783
I have to go to pee...
To the bathroom.

401
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,802
- Darling, is everything all right?
- Yeah.

402
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:38,972
Thank you.

403
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,651
What's the matter?

404
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:56,156
- You're not still mad at me, are you?
- No, it's not you. I mean....

405
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,033
Why would I still be mad at you?

406
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:03,038
Look, I'm sorry that I sprang a
divorce on you. Okay? I don't...

407
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:05,582
- We're married?
- No, we're not married.

408
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,376
So you are married to someone else?

409
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:11,254
Audrey, just forget the divorce.
All right?

410
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:13,757
We can go back to this
little farce of ours.

411
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:16,634
I get it.
You're right, commitment is scary.

412
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:20,096
- Did I break up with you?
- Yeah, but I know you didn't mean it.

413
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:22,182
I'll go back to her.

414
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:26,561
And you and I can... We'll just pretend
that none of this ever happened.

415
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:30,899
So wait, what, you would
just be with both of us?

416
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,361
That's what you want, isn't it?

417
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:39,908
I don't wanna be
someone's mistress.

418
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:42,577
I don't wanna be
someone's second choice.

419
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:45,830
I deserve better than that.

420
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:47,749
Audrey.

421
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,544
Wait. Audrey!

422
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,465
Leave me alone!

423
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,718
- Audrey.
- Go pay our check!

424
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:01,179
I don't understand what's...

425
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:06,851
Audrey. Goddamn it. Open up the door.
You're acting like a child.

426
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:09,562
Go away, okay?
Or I'm gonna call the police.

427
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:12,399
- Can we talk about this like adults?
- Go away.

428
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:16,653
No. You're not my second choice.
Why do you think I want a divorce?

429
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,156
- I'm trying to make this real.
- Audrey, is everything all right?

430
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:22,117
- Basel, is that you?
- Yes.

431
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:24,911
- Can you make him go away?
- I'm not gonna go away.

432
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:27,747
- Open the door.
- She said she wants you to go away.

433
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,582
This really doesn't concern you.

434
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:32,252
Oh, it kind of does
because she asked you...

435
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,753
Hey, don't kick her door.

436
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,214
Let's be gentlemen. Let's call her.

437
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:37,882
It'll make this...

438
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:42,554
Would you mind
your own business, pal?

439
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:50,645
What did you punch me
in the face for, man?

440
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:53,273
You son of a bitch.

441
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,830
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Oh, I'm sure he'll be just fine.

442
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:10,331
Oh, my God, are you okay?

443
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:13,543
Your boyfriend just accidentally
punched me in the face.

444
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,545
- I guess it's funny.
- I'm sorry.

445
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:19,341
Come in. I have, like,
Band-Aids, I think, and stuff.

446
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:21,926
It's a huge overreaction
by that guy.

447
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:24,888
I know. I'm sorry.
He's not really my boyfriend.

448
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:28,975
I'm really sorry about the mess.
I just didn't know what to wear.

449
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:32,896
Well, I'm just judging with
my one good eye anyhow.

450
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:48,703
Oh, fuck.

451
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:50,914
No, no, no.

452
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:52,415
Oh, no.

453
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:56,544
Oh, no, no, no. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

454
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:58,546
Oh, you fucking idiot.

455
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,884
I have all this stuff.

456
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,222
Sorry. I was looking at it
and then blood spilled on it.

457
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:13,228
I didn't mean to.

458
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:17,565
- Can I get a towel or something?
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

459
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:20,193
- Let me tilt your head back.
- Sure.

460
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,737
- I really just need one of these.
- Okay.

461
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:23,988
Thanks.

462
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:27,325
I think it's really good.
The painting.

463
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:31,079
Oh, no, it's not.
I just... I didn't even finish it.

464
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:35,250
I'm serious. I think it's really good.
I think it's better than the original.

465
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,753
I mean it. She's got,
like, bigger secrets.

466
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,047
Looks like she's got
plans for the weekend.

467
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:44,300
Yeah. I don't know.
I was gonna throw it away.

468
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:45,885
Throw it away? Well....

469
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:50,181
Considering it's our first collaboration,
with my blood and all, can I keep it?

470
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:52,767
Sure. I mean, if you want.

471
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:55,145
Well, I'll take it. Thanks.

472
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:57,605
How's your arm?

473
00:39:57,772 --> 00:39:59,983
It must've been a
pretty gnarly accident.

474
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,568
Yeah.

475
00:40:02,068 --> 00:40:03,945
Yeah, it was.

476
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:09,034
My sister...

477
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:13,121
died in it, the accident.

478
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:17,208
Fuck, Audrey. I didn't...

479
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:22,088
Was she older than you
or younger than you?

480
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:24,674
Younger...

481
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:27,218
by two minutes.

482
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,680
Your twin sister died?

483
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:33,725
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah.

484
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,226
Laurel.

485
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:39,230
Did I ever tell you about her?

486
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:42,192
No, you never told me about her.

487
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,778
We've never actually
talked, Audrey.

488
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:47,238
It's a miracle that
I'm sitting here now.

489
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:50,325
- I'm sorry.
- No, you don't... That came out wrong.

490
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,994
You don't have to be sorry.
Your twin just died.

491
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:55,121
You never have to be sorry
for anything again.

492
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:58,416
So like a free pass to just
be, like, a horrible person?

493
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,669
Sure.
You could be raping and pillaging.

494
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:03,046
- I'd probably forgive you for it.
- Great.

495
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:05,090
When my grandma died...

496
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:08,468
She raised me, meant everything to me.
I freaked out.

497
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,888
I got drunk all the time,
just waggled my dick around.

498
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:13,723
Just looked for trouble.

499
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:21,439
What was she like? Your sister?
If you don't mind talking about it.

500
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:26,653
Laurel...

501
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:29,739
lived at home still.

502
00:41:29,906 --> 00:41:32,826
She took care of our dad.

503
00:41:33,618 --> 00:41:37,747
We come from this
really small town.

504
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:42,585
People thought, you know, pretty
much thought she was a weirdo.

505
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:44,462
I was kind of her only friend.

506
00:41:44,629 --> 00:41:47,007
Well, everybody thinks
I'm really weird.

507
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:51,428
But I'm not. I'm actually fucking
really smart and talented.

508
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:53,888
So that's probably
how your sister is too.

509
00:41:54,055 --> 00:41:56,599
Do you do that a lot?

510
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,143
Compliment yourself.

511
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:00,812
- Doesn't everybody?
- No, I don't think so.

512
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:05,942
I think everybody pretty much just tells
themselves they suck all the time.

513
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:07,402
Well, then I dare you.

514
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:10,113
Oh, yeah, to what?

515
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,991
What do you think?
To compliment yourself.

516
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:17,328
Okay.

517
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:22,250
Okay. I am... I am really....

518
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:26,212
I am really small.

519
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:31,926
That is the worst
compliment I've heard.

520
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:33,386
That's a fact.

521
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:36,222
That's not a compliment,
but it's a start.

522
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,932
We got a start, Audrey.

523
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:39,517
All right.

524
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:42,854
Here. Were you serious
about this painting?

525
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:46,232
Or was that what people say when
you bleed on their painting?

526
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,402
- Yeah, you can take that if you want it.
- I want to.

527
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:52,697
No, no, no. It's okay.
Thanks for everything.

528
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:55,075
- Thanks for defending me.
- You got it.

529
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:56,785
Hey...

530
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:00,538
we should hang out
sometime, you know?

531
00:43:00,705 --> 00:43:02,999
Oh, yeah. I mean....

532
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,710
You mean like a date or...?

533
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:07,379
No, just as friends.

534
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:09,631
Oh, yeah, right. Friends. Cool.

535
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:16,012
Anyway, I've got this thing that I
was in the middle of doing and...

536
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:20,392
What the...?

537
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:10,525
Audrey, darling.

538
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:12,902
I am so sorry for your loss.

539
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:15,613
I can't imagine what
you've been through.

540
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,742
Oh, thank you.

541
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:20,744
- Edith.
- Edith.

542
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,996
Take as much time as you need.

543
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:25,707
And let me know if I can
do anything for you.

544
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:26,875
- Anything.
- Great.

545
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:29,711
We're actually on our way
to show some properties.

546
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:33,298
Wonderful. We need her back in
action as soon as we can get her.

547
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:34,758
Come.

548
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:44,059
All right.

549
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:47,312
Let's do this.

550
00:44:56,654 --> 00:44:57,906
All right.

551
00:44:58,573 --> 00:45:01,326
The empty ones are always
the hardest to sell.

552
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:03,495
Oh, yeah, totally.

553
00:45:05,288 --> 00:45:07,665
- Are you all right?
- I'm cool.

554
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:10,251
Okay. It's second nature.

555
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:13,546
You just point out the good
stuff, minimize the bad.

556
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:16,716
Pitch them on a future life
where their dreams come true.

557
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:20,387
They either like it or not, and
you do the fucking paperwork.

558
00:45:20,553 --> 00:45:22,138
Okay.

559
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:23,556
Okay.

560
00:45:23,723 --> 00:45:26,267
- You're gonna be great.
- Great.

561
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:28,061
All right.

562
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:30,230
- Hi, Mrs. Matthews.
- Hello.

563
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:32,315
- Come in.
- Thank you.

564
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:33,525
- David.
- Hi.

565
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:35,485
- Darren.
- Oh, my stars.

566
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:39,531
- What happened to you?
- Oh, I got in an accident.

567
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:42,951
- I'm fine.
- Oh, well....

568
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:45,412
So....

569
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:51,710
So this is the...

570
00:45:53,211 --> 00:45:55,046
living room.

571
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:02,178
Over there is a...

572
00:46:02,345 --> 00:46:03,388
little door.

573
00:46:11,896 --> 00:46:13,857
I'm sorry.

574
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:16,067
I froze.

575
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:18,778
I'm gonna figure it out, I promise.
Please.

576
00:46:18,945 --> 00:46:20,572
Just don't be mad at me.

577
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:23,241
I'm not mad at you.

578
00:46:23,783 --> 00:46:26,119
I just don't know what
is going on with you.

579
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:27,787
That's not you.

580
00:46:27,954 --> 00:46:32,125
I got nervous.

581
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:47,557
There's like this whole community
for twins whose twin died...

582
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:51,102
and, okay, they have
these support groups.

583
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:54,397
I got you some brochures, here.

584
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,287
Why did you get me so many?

585
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:15,377
Hey, Audrey.

586
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:19,255
This is the girl I told you about,
the one who has amnesia.

587
00:47:19,422 --> 00:47:20,715
- Hi.
- Hi.

588
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,470
- What?
- Nothing.

589
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:29,182
Basel thinks you're prettier now
that you stopped being a beyotch.

590
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:31,685
- Peter.
- Someone's gotta have some balls.

591
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:33,436
He said that? Really?

592
00:47:33,603 --> 00:47:36,356
Do you "like" like him?

593
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:38,233
No.

594
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:42,237
What are you doing?

595
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:43,446
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

596
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:44,656
What did you say?

597
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:45,865
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

598
00:47:46,032 --> 00:47:47,200
What did you guys say?

599
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:48,410
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

600
00:47:48,576 --> 00:47:50,829
Why you guys talking
at the same time again?

601
00:48:09,597 --> 00:48:11,057
No.

602
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:45,884
No, don't go.

603
00:48:49,387 --> 00:48:51,139
Don't leave.

604
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:03,401
Hello?

605
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:05,487
<i>Hello?</i>

606
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:09,741
Hi, Daddy. I mean, Dad.

607
00:49:13,244 --> 00:49:16,081
May and I are getting married
at the end of the month.

608
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:19,959
<i>It's just a little
courthouse thing...</i>

609
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:23,880
<i>so we'd like you to come
be our witness.</i>

610
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:33,181
Don't you think it's a little
soon, Dad? I mean...

611
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:36,309
<i>she just died.</i>

612
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:40,980
Life's too short to
wait any longer.

613
00:49:41,856 --> 00:49:44,150
I've been alone a long time.

614
00:49:45,902 --> 00:49:47,654
Dad?

615
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:51,991
It's just...

616
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:56,246
you know, I get to
painting in the morning...

617
00:49:57,956 --> 00:50:01,584
and I realize I'm
just really hungry.

618
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:04,546
I'm waiting for her to
come bring me breakfast.

619
00:50:07,215 --> 00:50:13,555
<i>She used to smash raspberries
down on the toast, you know?</i>

620
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:16,725
<i>- She said that...</i>
- Jam is too sugary.

621
00:50:16,891 --> 00:50:19,227
Yeah, yeah.

622
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:25,442
- Dad.
- Frank.

623
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:32,574
<i>- Dad.</i>
- Yeah?

624
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,957
Nothing.

625
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:45,545
Look, I know we haven't
talked since....

626
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:49,382
But now that's... We're all that's
left of our little family, you know?

627
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:53,136
<i>You know, maybe we should
try to talk sometimes.</i>

628
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:54,971
Sure, Dad.

629
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:57,682
Frank.

630
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:00,226
I gotta go, okay?

631
00:51:00,393 --> 00:51:02,604
I gotta go. I gotta go.

632
00:51:29,255 --> 00:51:34,260
I think that that's something that James
has been struggling with as well. So....

633
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:35,720
Hi, welcome.

634
00:51:35,887 --> 00:51:37,972
Come join us, please.

635
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:39,724
Hi.

636
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:49,651
New members usually start
by introducing themselves.

637
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:51,236
Would you like to do that?

638
00:51:52,737 --> 00:51:55,323
My name is Laurel... Audrey.

639
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,742
Hi, Laurel Audrey.

640
00:51:57,909 --> 00:52:00,120
Welcome to Twins Without Twins.

641
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:03,081
Would you like to tell
us what you're feeling?

642
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,419
I'm...

643
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:14,300
just having a hard time...

644
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:18,638
letting go of my sister.

645
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:21,808
I think we all know how that feels,
right?

646
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:23,059
- Yes.
- Yeah.

647
00:52:23,226 --> 00:52:24,477
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

648
00:52:25,103 --> 00:52:27,647
Would you like to tell us more
about your twin...

649
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:31,443
or the different emotions that
you've been going through?

650
00:53:33,004 --> 00:53:34,506
Hey.

651
00:53:35,298 --> 00:53:36,591
Oh, hey.

652
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:38,593
Did they say you could do that?

653
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,846
No, they didn't. Come on in.

654
00:53:43,181 --> 00:53:44,599
I can't.

655
00:53:44,766 --> 00:53:46,643
So what?

656
00:53:48,728 --> 00:53:50,730
Hang on.

657
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:25,557
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

658
00:54:25,724 --> 00:54:26,933
Well, come on in.

659
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,310
You've already done the hard part.

660
00:54:29,477 --> 00:54:32,731
I'd take the stairs,
it's the easiest way in.

661
00:54:32,897 --> 00:54:34,399
- Is it okay?
- It's cold.

662
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:37,068
Yeah, they don't heat it
when they're gone.

663
00:54:39,362 --> 00:54:42,198
Yeah, just commit to
it, just jump in.

664
00:54:42,365 --> 00:54:44,242
It's super terrible but just do it.

665
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:57,881
Nice job.

666
00:54:58,173 --> 00:55:00,091
- It's cold, right?
- Yeah.

667
00:55:00,258 --> 00:55:03,845
- Well, I'm glad you did it.
- Yeah.

668
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:05,889
I think...

669
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,059
I think I might....

670
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:14,481
Well, thank you for joining me for
this midnight swim, Mrs. Brown.

671
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:17,484
What?

672
00:55:18,234 --> 00:55:22,572
It's kind of easier if we just pretend
we're married and this is our pool.

673
00:55:23,573 --> 00:55:25,867
Mr. Brown...

674
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:30,705
you've done such a beautiful job
keeping this pool nice and clean.

675
00:55:30,872 --> 00:55:34,042
Well, Mrs. Brown, you know,
I do everything I can.

676
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:36,795
I shouldn't have fired
the heating guy.

677
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:41,383
You know me, Mrs. Brown, I think
I can do everything myself.

678
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:44,260
I think...

679
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:48,807
I'm gonna need your help with
the children in the morning.

680
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:50,016
For the bake sale?

681
00:55:50,183 --> 00:55:54,479
Yeah, because we've gotta raise
some money for the rainforest.

682
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:58,233
Oh, absolutely. That's a big concern
of Dicky and Janey.

683
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,236
And maybe you could pack their
lunches in the morning.

684
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:05,240
I'll pack their lunch, put a note in
there, tell them how much I adore...

685
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:07,409
Their mother?

686
00:56:09,452 --> 00:56:10,912
Yeah.

687
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:14,624
And then, you know...

688
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,503
after school we can...

689
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:23,758
you know, take them
to the playground and....

690
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:52,746
How do you take this thing off?

691
00:56:52,912 --> 00:56:54,873
Just break it.

692
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:08,219
- Oh, my God.
- No, not...

693
00:57:08,386 --> 00:57:10,722
- Am I doing something wrong?
- No, you're not.

694
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:12,265
- What am I doing?
- Nothing.

695
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:13,975
Just say it.

696
00:57:15,226 --> 00:57:18,063
I like it when you touch me.
That was it.

697
00:57:19,022 --> 00:57:21,775
- You did?
- I do, that was....

698
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:26,237
Even when I touch you in your ear?

699
00:58:04,442 --> 00:58:06,736
- Beep.
- Beep.

700
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,615
Beep.

701
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:24,421
Thanks.

702
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:26,464
I feed you.

703
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:56,494
Audrey.

704
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:01,166
Audrey.

705
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:09,257
Audrey, are you here?

706
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:18,350
Audrey.

707
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:26,066
Audrey, come on.

708
00:59:39,704 --> 00:59:41,790
What do you wanna order, Mr. Brown?

709
00:59:41,956 --> 00:59:45,043
- Would you like to split something?
- I suppose, Mr. Brown.

710
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,087
- Does that sound good?
- Sounds good.

711
00:59:47,253 --> 00:59:50,507
- Seriously?
- It's so crazy that your twin died.

712
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:54,844
Elvis' twin died at birth.
He never got over it.

713
00:59:55,011 --> 00:59:57,389
- Jesus, Patrick.
- What? It's true.

714
00:59:57,555 --> 01:00:00,475
You have the subtlety
of a monster truck.

715
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:02,602
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

716
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:05,188
- Yeah, he totally killed himself.
- Dude.

717
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:08,191
What is...? Everybody
knows Elvis died.

718
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:11,069
Oh, God.

719
01:00:14,406 --> 01:00:18,076
She shouldn't be
having so much fun.

720
01:00:18,243 --> 01:00:19,786
I mean, it's not right.

721
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:21,579
It's not right to have fun?

722
01:00:21,746 --> 01:00:24,249
No, not when you're
mourning your twin sister.

723
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:27,627
What, you want her wearing black
and wailing all the time?

724
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:30,338
Yeah. No.

725
01:00:30,505 --> 01:00:32,215
But she doesn't...

726
01:00:32,757 --> 01:00:35,885
She seems different, doesn't she?

727
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:38,763
- She's still hot.
- Oh, fuck you, Patrick.

728
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:42,559
Hey, Mrs. Brown.

729
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:46,646
It's time to wake up if we're
gonna beat the crowds.

730
01:00:46,813 --> 01:00:50,567
But who's gonna watch the kids?

731
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:52,610
Come on.

732
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,223
- Hi.
- Hey.

733
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:07,227
She's out back painting if you want her.
You can walk through my place.

734
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:10,397
- I actually need to talk to you.
- To me?

735
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:14,275
Well, what have I done?

736
01:02:15,276 --> 01:02:17,320
Does she ever...?

737
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:20,782
- Does she talk to you about Laurel?
- Yeah, a lot.

738
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:22,117
That is... Yeah.

739
01:02:22,283 --> 01:02:24,828
She won't talk to me and
I wanted to make sure...

740
01:02:24,994 --> 01:02:27,747
- ...that someone was here for her...
- Well, I'm here.

741
01:02:27,914 --> 01:02:29,124
I got it.

742
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:31,793
Okay.

743
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:35,046
You know, she seems
perfect but she's not.

744
01:02:35,213 --> 01:02:37,716
Usually she has her guard up, okay?

745
01:02:37,882 --> 01:02:40,927
She wants everyone to believe
she's got it all together...

746
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:43,513
but with you, she's
let her guard down.

747
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:47,600
If you break her heart, I will
fucking murder your face.

748
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:51,730
- Definitely. Thanks for talking to me.
- I don't get it.

749
01:02:51,896 --> 01:02:55,108
Just a few weeks ago, we
were making fun of your B.O.

750
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:59,487
Thanks for stopping by.

751
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:20,967
How come you don't ever talk
about your sister with me?

752
01:03:22,844 --> 01:03:25,513
You know, everything
is so great with us.

753
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,515
Come on, cool it with that.

754
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:32,062
What do you think, if you show me how
you feel, I'm not gonna like you?

755
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:34,647
- Yeah, maybe.
- Really?

756
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:37,942
This isn't gonna last
if it's like that.

757
01:03:38,109 --> 01:03:41,529
If this is real, we gotta tell
each other the bad stuff.

758
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:46,743
And if this isn't real, if this
is just my kind of imagination...

759
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,328
then I wanna know now.

760
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:57,712
I don't know what I'm doing.
I have never done this before.

761
01:03:59,547 --> 01:04:01,299
I don't...

762
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:04,552
I don't even know what
the real me looks like.

763
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,430
- Well, I think I do.
- Really?

764
01:04:07,597 --> 01:04:08,932
Yes, I do.

765
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:11,267
She's funny and she's weird...

766
01:04:11,434 --> 01:04:15,230
and likes to play games
and she makes me laugh.

767
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:18,566
I think that's the real you.

768
01:04:20,985 --> 01:04:22,904
I like her.

769
01:04:24,155 --> 01:04:26,032
That's who I want.

770
01:04:27,033 --> 01:04:29,035
That's what I want.

771
01:04:30,537 --> 01:04:34,124
So this is my favorite
feature of the house.

772
01:04:36,042 --> 01:04:41,339
I thought it would make a great little
clubhouse for your kids someday.

773
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:46,386
- I'm never gonna be able to get in there.
- But I can.

774
01:04:48,054 --> 01:04:51,558
No, I'm definitely not
gonna fit in there.

775
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:53,518
- Isn't this awesome?
- I love it.

776
01:04:55,061 --> 01:04:58,064
Here is the yard.

777
01:04:58,231 --> 01:05:00,942
Now, you said you like to cook.

778
01:05:01,192 --> 01:05:05,196
I was thinking you could plant a little
vegetable garden right over there.

779
01:05:05,363 --> 01:05:07,615
And eat the harvest
every year as a family.

780
01:05:07,782 --> 01:05:09,492
I'm so excited to show you this.

781
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:12,996
There's a beautiful place you'll
really love to put a swing.

782
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:15,331
I like swinging.

783
01:05:15,498 --> 01:05:17,792
- Happy hour after?
- Of course.

784
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:21,087
- I'll get started on the agreement.
- Get those papers, girl.

785
01:05:21,254 --> 01:05:22,297
I know.

786
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:24,841
- So proud of you.
- Thank you.

787
01:05:44,736 --> 01:05:46,696
Hi, sir.

788
01:05:46,863 --> 01:05:48,740
What are you doing here?

789
01:05:49,407 --> 01:05:51,368
- Hi, dear.
- Hi.

790
01:05:51,534 --> 01:05:54,913
- How's everything going?
- It's great.

791
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,832
Guess what? I just got an
offer on the new storybook.

792
01:05:57,999 --> 01:06:00,251
Fantastic.

793
01:06:00,418 --> 01:06:02,796
Audrey is recovering
from a nasty accident.

794
01:06:02,962 --> 01:06:04,005
Terrible.

795
01:06:04,172 --> 01:06:06,132
He's not a client, he's my ex.

796
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:07,801
I think we should get going.

797
01:06:07,967 --> 01:06:10,553
The appointment... We don't
wanna be late for that.

798
01:06:20,146 --> 01:06:22,357
And we can discuss this in the car.

799
01:06:24,567 --> 01:06:28,988
What part of "Can you keep your dick out
of my office while I'm pregnant?"...

800
01:06:29,155 --> 01:06:30,740
did you not understand?

801
01:06:30,907 --> 01:06:34,744
- Edith, let's discuss this in the car.
- No, we'll be discussing this now.

802
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:36,246
I am so sorry.

803
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:42,961
I will be back at 3 and I expect there
to be no trace of you left here.

804
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:45,213
All we did was kiss.

805
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,132
Oh, my God, I'm... Your poor baby.

806
01:06:47,298 --> 01:06:49,342
I'm really, really...

807
01:06:56,182 --> 01:06:57,976
Audrey.

808
01:06:58,643 --> 01:07:00,353
Charles.

809
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:03,565
Charles.

810
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:22,167
She was not supposed to be the one
to fuck this up. I was. It is my job.

811
01:07:22,334 --> 01:07:28,131
- I am always the one who does that.
- You'll get another job, Audrey.

812
01:07:28,298 --> 01:07:32,594
- I think you need to take some time off.
- I don't wanna take time off.

813
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:35,096
I don't want to have all
day to sit around...

814
01:07:35,263 --> 01:07:38,975
and think about how half of me is
fucking dead for fucking ever.

815
01:07:39,934 --> 01:07:44,606
- Does that sound like fun to you?
- No, no, not really.

816
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,651
It sounds terrible, I'm sorry. I...

817
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:54,574
Basel.

818
01:08:02,665 --> 01:08:04,501
Basel.

819
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:17,847
We need to get some ice cream.

820
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,392
Ice cream is not gonna fix this.

821
01:08:20,558 --> 01:08:24,312
Mrs. Brown, ice cream
fixes everything.

822
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:28,400
Yeah, it's gonna get me a job?

823
01:08:28,942 --> 01:08:30,318
Yes.

824
01:08:32,904 --> 01:08:34,656
Here, would you hold this?

825
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:36,908
You can even have some.

826
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:39,077
This is gonna cheer you up.

827
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:45,792
Well, Mrs. Brown, I got something
I've been wanting to give you.

828
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:51,798
As you know, we are a happily married
couple with two lovely kids.

829
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:54,009
But I want more.

830
01:08:54,884 --> 01:08:57,012
I wanna renew our vows, dear.

831
01:08:58,513 --> 01:09:00,181
Okay.

832
01:09:00,724 --> 01:09:03,018
You don't believe me, all right.

833
01:09:03,184 --> 01:09:08,565
So the thing I got you, Mrs. Brown,
is a very expensive ring.

834
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:11,026
What are you doing?

835
01:09:11,192 --> 01:09:16,740
Will you marry me again and make me
the happiest man in the whole world?

836
01:09:18,366 --> 01:09:22,203
You are very cute but you
have terrible timing.

837
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:24,706
Well, that's a weird no.

838
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:31,046
For real...

839
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,881
I love you now.

840
01:09:35,342 --> 01:09:39,095
And I've loved you since the first
moment that I met you, Audrey.

841
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,940
- Take it back.
- I thought you'd have a different reaction.

842
01:09:51,107 --> 01:09:53,526
- Take that part back.
- Take what back?

843
01:09:53,693 --> 01:09:55,987
The part about loving
me since you met me.

844
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:59,574
What difference does it make?
It's a nice thing to say.

845
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:02,869
I need this to be
mine, to be my love.

846
01:10:03,036 --> 01:10:06,581
It is yours. I don't care if you
didn't love me when we first met.

847
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:10,627
But if you loved me back then, it
means you don't actually love me.

848
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:13,421
Well, I don't think
that's true, Audrey.

849
01:10:13,588 --> 01:10:15,715
I'm not Audrey.

850
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:21,554
- Because you're Mrs. Brown?
- No, I'm not Mrs. Brown.

851
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:25,767
And I'm not Audrey.

852
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:29,104
I don't get what game
we're playing right now.

853
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:32,482
I'm Laurel.

854
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:35,235
I'm her twin.

855
01:10:38,071 --> 01:10:39,406
What does that mean?

856
01:10:41,282 --> 01:10:42,909
Audrey died, we're twins.

857
01:10:43,076 --> 01:10:46,287
- Audrey died.
- Are you...?

858
01:10:48,331 --> 01:10:51,084
- Are you being serious?
- Yes.

859
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:56,881
So you died, or your sister died in
the car accident, and you came back?

860
01:10:57,048 --> 01:11:01,594
They got confused in the hospital.
They thought I was Audrey but I'm not.

861
01:11:01,761 --> 01:11:05,098
And I didn't remember at first.

862
01:11:05,932 --> 01:11:08,935
- If this is a joke, it's...
- It's not a joke.

863
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:12,230
You lied this whole time?

864
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:14,315
You pretended
to be your dead sister?

865
01:11:14,482 --> 01:11:17,068
I'm the same person. I just
have a different name.

866
01:11:17,235 --> 01:11:19,237
Who does that?

867
01:11:19,779 --> 01:11:21,990
I trusted you.

868
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:25,577
- I asked if it was real and you said yeah.
- It is real.

869
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:27,704
It's all bullshit.

870
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:29,831
I'm so sorry. I just...

871
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:28,014
Hi.

872
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:31,434
- The wedding's not till next week, honey.
- I know.

873
01:12:31,601 --> 01:12:33,311
Can I come in?

874
01:12:33,478 --> 01:12:35,563
Come in, come in.

875
01:12:37,273 --> 01:12:42,404
I came here because I need
to tell you something.

876
01:12:43,863 --> 01:12:44,906
Okay.

877
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:48,284
You guys...

878
01:12:49,703 --> 01:12:51,538
were wrong.

879
01:12:53,206 --> 01:12:56,126
At the hospital, you were wrong.

880
01:12:56,376 --> 01:12:58,670
Wrong about what?

881
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:01,881
Who I am.

882
01:13:02,757 --> 01:13:06,928
Audrey is the one who died.

883
01:13:09,097 --> 01:13:10,473
What?

884
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:25,488
Porcupine?

885
01:13:29,284 --> 01:13:31,077
Oh, my God.

886
01:13:36,249 --> 01:13:37,876
But, you...

887
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:39,085
I mean...

888
01:13:40,003 --> 01:13:41,379
But...

889
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:43,423
your hair...

890
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:45,967
- I mean, we all thought...
- You poor child.

891
01:13:48,094 --> 01:13:50,055
When did you finally remember?

892
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:56,102
The morning of the funeral.

893
01:13:57,729 --> 01:14:01,524
You went to your own funeral?
On purpose?

894
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:04,903
Is this funny to you?

895
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:07,238
No, no, it's not funny to me.

896
01:14:17,123 --> 01:14:19,709
No, Daddy.

897
01:14:34,099 --> 01:14:35,600
Dad.

898
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:43,066
Dad.

899
01:14:45,318 --> 01:14:46,945
Daddy.

900
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:48,905
Frank.

901
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:51,908
Frank, do something.

902
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:54,828
- Do something.
- I can't find my fucking cerulean.

903
01:14:54,994 --> 01:14:56,246
I'm sorry, Dad.

904
01:14:56,413 --> 01:14:57,580
No, stop it.

905
01:14:57,747 --> 01:14:59,082
There is no excuse.

906
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:00,625
This is beyond...

907
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:03,378
No, but, Dad, no one
cared that I was gone.

908
01:15:03,545 --> 01:15:05,338
How can you say that?

909
01:15:05,505 --> 01:15:06,840
You were my porcupine.

910
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:08,925
- We did everything together.
- I know.

911
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:12,846
But, Daddy, you didn't even have
anything to say at the funeral.

912
01:15:13,763 --> 01:15:15,098
I was in shock, you know?

913
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:18,351
Just lost my baby girl.
Excuse me if I wasn't Shakespeare.

914
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:21,062
I just...

915
01:15:21,896 --> 01:15:24,357
I just needed to know that...

916
01:15:26,067 --> 01:15:27,193
That you loved me.

917
01:15:27,819 --> 01:15:29,946
We're gonna have to
have another funeral.

918
01:15:30,113 --> 01:15:34,534
- What are people gonna say?
- I don't give a hot damn what they say!

919
01:15:34,701 --> 01:15:37,620
Don't get snippy with me!
I'm not the one who lied.

920
01:15:37,787 --> 01:15:39,581
Can I just have a minute?

921
01:15:39,748 --> 01:15:43,835
- Can you two just give me a moment?
- Well, I never!

922
01:16:41,685 --> 01:16:43,228
Daddy?

923
01:16:47,524 --> 01:16:49,025
Daddy.

924
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:08,169
- I'll do that.
- I got it.

925
01:17:08,336 --> 01:17:09,796
But I always do the dishes.

926
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:15,051
Well, I've been doing them since
you left, so it's about time.

927
01:17:15,635 --> 01:17:17,220
Okay.

928
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,728
What can I do to make
you stop hating me?

929
01:17:30,442 --> 01:17:34,487
I don't know when I'm gonna find it in
my heart to forgive you on this, porc.

930
01:17:37,282 --> 01:17:38,908
I mean...

931
01:17:40,368 --> 01:17:42,954
I'm glad you're back and all...

932
01:17:44,622 --> 01:17:49,586
but here I am mourning the
death of another child.

933
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:53,548
And I'll be goddamned if it's
not confusing as all hell.

934
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:56,801
I understand.

935
01:17:56,968 --> 01:17:58,970
I don't think you do.

936
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:02,057
But I want to.

937
01:18:02,223 --> 01:18:04,351
I want to know.

938
01:18:08,104 --> 01:18:11,649
If there's anything I took
away from your being dead...

939
01:18:11,816 --> 01:18:15,111
it's that I wished you'd have
stopped worrying about me...

940
01:18:15,278 --> 01:18:17,322
and gotten on with your life.

941
01:18:17,489 --> 01:18:20,658
You need to start worrying about
what you're dealing with.

942
01:19:25,515 --> 01:19:30,061
<i>Would anyone like to say a
few parting words to Audrey?</i>

943
01:19:38,028 --> 01:19:39,404
Well...

944
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:46,411
this is a certifiably weird place
I've put everyone in, huh?

945
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:52,042
Nothing I say really matters.

946
01:19:53,209 --> 01:19:56,046
You still think
there's something wrong with me...

947
01:19:57,213 --> 01:19:59,299
and you would be right.

948
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:02,260
So...

949
01:20:04,387 --> 01:20:06,556
I'll just say this.

950
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:10,602
Audrey....

951
01:20:12,395 --> 01:20:14,481
Audrey was...

952
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,528
everything to me.

953
01:20:22,572 --> 01:20:26,201
She was the much bigger
half of our whole.

954
01:20:29,621 --> 01:20:31,289
And I couldn't let her go.

955
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:56,981
Hey, guys.

956
01:20:57,148 --> 01:20:59,067
- Hi, Laurel.
- Hey.

957
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:00,527
Thank you for coming.

958
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:05,615
Do you wanna give me
the official tour?

959
01:21:05,782 --> 01:21:07,701
A tour?

960
01:21:07,867 --> 01:21:09,452
Sure.

961
01:21:09,619 --> 01:21:12,539
This is the living
room with furniture.

962
01:21:13,623 --> 01:21:16,376
Okay, come with me.

963
01:21:19,879 --> 01:21:22,257
So are you staying here?

964
01:21:24,009 --> 01:21:25,719
No.

965
01:21:26,553 --> 01:21:30,098
It's not exactly an abode
for a grown woman.

966
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:32,726
Well said, Captain Obvious.

967
01:21:32,892 --> 01:21:35,061
I was just saying.

968
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:40,817
I thought I was going crazy back
there, but I knew it wasn't her.

969
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:42,402
I know you did.

970
01:21:42,944 --> 01:21:45,155
You more than anyone.

971
01:21:47,365 --> 01:21:49,617
You must have really loved her.

972
01:21:49,784 --> 01:21:53,413
I wanted to be just like her.

973
01:21:54,539 --> 01:21:55,915
But I'm not.

974
01:21:56,082 --> 01:21:58,877
I guess we have more in
common than we thought.

975
01:22:06,384 --> 01:22:09,721
I'm gonna go back to the city...

976
01:22:10,805 --> 01:22:14,684
and I think it's best we remain friends
despite our past disagreements.

977
01:22:18,938 --> 01:22:21,066
Yeah, I agree.

978
01:22:22,776 --> 01:22:24,569
Good.

979
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:55,767
Good technique.

980
01:22:56,559 --> 01:22:58,561
Beautiful palette.

981
01:22:58,895 --> 01:23:00,105
You got more of these?

982
01:23:03,483 --> 01:23:04,901
You should show them.

983
01:23:06,194 --> 01:23:09,406
Yeah, I was thinking about
taking them around.

984
01:23:14,244 --> 01:23:16,413
It's about time you
did your own work.

985
01:23:28,216 --> 01:23:29,926
So...

986
01:23:33,972 --> 01:23:37,809
you probably figured
this out already...

987
01:23:39,394 --> 01:23:41,104
but I'm in love.

988
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:47,944
I know, I know we
disagree on this...

989
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:55,160
but I actually think
he smells really good.

990
01:23:56,494 --> 01:23:58,580
He smells real.

991
01:23:59,247 --> 01:24:00,874
You know...

992
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:04,210
like sweat and life...

993
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:08,757
and sex.

994
01:24:11,384 --> 01:24:13,887
I feel like myself around him.

995
01:24:18,516 --> 01:24:21,144
And I'm making you a promise.

996
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:23,104
Right now...

997
01:24:25,398 --> 01:24:28,985
I'm going to do what
you wanted me to do.

998
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,906
I'm going to be more like me.

999
01:24:34,532 --> 01:24:36,993
Find out what that really means.

1000
01:26:51,002 --> 01:26:52,087
What do you want?

1001
01:26:53,505 --> 01:26:55,090
You.

1002
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,008
I want you, please.

1003
01:26:57,175 --> 01:26:58,551
May I please have you?

1004
01:27:00,553 --> 01:27:02,222
Well, you know what?

1005
01:27:02,389 --> 01:27:04,265
Fuck you if you think
I'm that easy.

1006
01:27:04,891 --> 01:27:07,102
I know you're not that easy.

1007
01:27:07,644 --> 01:27:10,355
- Little cowboy coming up.
- Hey, kids, what's up?

1008
01:27:10,522 --> 01:27:12,816
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

1009
01:27:12,982 --> 01:27:14,734
All right, get in there, guys.

1010
01:27:14,901 --> 01:27:17,362
Guys, plenty of sweets right here.
It's candy.

1011
01:27:17,529 --> 01:27:19,739
- You're early this year.
- Happy Halloween.

1012
01:27:19,906 --> 01:27:22,826
- Happy Halloween.
- Happy Halloween.

1013
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:26,871
So, what are you dressed as?

1014
01:27:27,038 --> 01:27:28,623
Myself.

1015
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:35,296
- So that's what Laurel looks like?
- Yeah, this is what I look like.

1016
01:27:39,509 --> 01:27:44,305
I told everyone at home about
the whole identity thing.

1017
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:46,641
Wow, how'd that go?

1018
01:27:46,808 --> 01:27:48,476
I'm still alive.

1019
01:27:49,477 --> 01:27:52,772
Well, you seem to be, but you
never know with the two of you.

1020
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:58,028
I miss you.

1021
01:27:58,194 --> 01:28:00,613
I miss you terribly.

1022
01:28:02,449 --> 01:28:05,201
I know you feel like
you don't know me...

1023
01:28:05,702 --> 01:28:08,246
but I'm telling you, you do.

1024
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:12,042
I'm just asking you to take
a chance on that person.

1025
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:17,714
I know I really messed up.
I know I am fucked up.

1026
01:28:18,715 --> 01:28:20,675
But despite all that, I...

1027
01:28:21,092 --> 01:28:23,386
All in all, I am...

1028
01:28:24,554 --> 01:28:27,098
like, a pretty cool girl.

1029
01:28:32,062 --> 01:28:34,314
Well, nice work on
complimenting yourself.

1030
01:28:35,023 --> 01:28:36,608
Thank you.

1031
01:28:38,026 --> 01:28:42,072
Also, I really think you should
know this cast comes off tomorrow.

1032
01:28:42,572 --> 01:28:44,699
You've never seen
this forearm before.

1033
01:28:44,866 --> 01:28:49,496
It's probably atrophied and will never
be as muscular as the other one.

1034
01:28:49,662 --> 01:28:51,414
Gee, thank you.

1035
01:28:59,005 --> 01:29:00,840
I don't know.

1036
01:29:04,344 --> 01:29:06,930
Well, do you wanna
sit down with me?

1037
01:29:13,978 --> 01:29:17,649
So what, did you, like, inherit
the duplex or something?

1038
01:29:17,816 --> 01:29:19,401
Yeah.

1039
01:29:19,984 --> 01:29:23,446
And I was thinking about
doing some construction.

1040
01:29:25,031 --> 01:29:26,783
Like what?

1041
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:30,829
Tear down the wall between the
two apartments, make it one.

1042
01:29:30,995 --> 01:29:32,789
Oh, yeah?
