00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,818
- Excellent grades throughout
your high school career,

355
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:24,255
but your rap sheet is
just as impressive.

356
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:26,997
How could you think
you could even go here,

357
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,653
let alone ask the college
to pay the money for it?

358
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:33,569
- How could I think
I could go here?

359
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:34,614
How could I not?

360
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:36,137
- Excuse me?

361
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,531
- About 45 % of black children
graduate high school.

362
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,184
One in three black
males can expect

363
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:42,099
to go to jail in their life.

364
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:43,840
Probably spend their
18th birthday in jail.

365
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:45,146
- I understand--

366
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:46,539
- A young black male
is more likely to die

367
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:49,150
by gunfire than any soldier
has done in Vietnam.

368
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,369
- You know your stuff.

369
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,022
- I spent my 18th
birthday a free man

370
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,024
applying to this university.

371
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:56,070
So if I could survive
all that and more

372
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:58,812
I can at least think I
can make it anywhere.

373
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:01,031
I just need the financial aid.

374
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,511
- You are something.

375
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:03,773
[Laughs]

376
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,688
So tell me, should
I overlook the

377
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:08,474
drug possession with
intent to distribute?

378
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,127
The fights?

379
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:12,695
The board wear ring you may
or may not be involved in?

380
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:17,570
I want to help you but
help me to understand this.

381
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:20,311
I mean, what were
you even thinking

382
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,096
getting involved in this stuff?

383
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,405
- There's a term, affluenza.

384
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,145
- [Mrs. Brooks] Excuse me?

385
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:31,584
[Classical piano music]

386
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:02,789
- This shit is crazy.

387
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,879
It's called affluenza.

388
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,620
That anybody does not
understand the consequences

389
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:11,450
of one's actions based
on financial privilege.

390
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,581
- What?

391
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,408
Man, I don't believe that.

392
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,018
- Believe it, it's real.

393
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:19,196
See, there was this rich kid
that hit a bunch of folks

394
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,461
in his whip and he got
off because he had money.

395
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:25,768
- What do you mean?

396
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:27,117
What are you saying?

397
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:28,379
- Think about it.

398
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:32,209
All we know, people
selling, people robbing.

399
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:33,559
Shit, we got family members in

400
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:35,648
they 30's still in
that trapped life.

401
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,651
We risk whatever 'cause if
we don't life ain't shit.

402
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:42,176
We not worrying about the consequences 'cause we too broke.

403
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:48,661
- And what are your thoughts
now on this reversed affluenza?

404
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:49,792
- I think he was wrong.

405
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:53,317
We knew exactly
what we were doing.

406
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,755
We just didn't care.

407
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:56,973
- You are remarkable.

408
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:05,765
- Thank you.

409
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:09,812
[Students chattering]

410
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,819
[slamming]

411
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,130
- Sit down.

412
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:27,917
Look at all the fresh meat.

413
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:30,137
[Laughs]

414
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,661
You're laughing
now, you might not

415
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:34,924
be laughing when I'm done.

416
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:38,232
My name is Gerard Balan.

417
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:42,236
You don't know me and,
honestly, I prefer it that way.

418
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:46,414
This is my first
year as a professor

419
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:49,591
and I plan on taking a
more unconventional route

420
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:53,029
to teaching the bright young
minds of this generation.

421
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:57,077
I won't bore you with my
rap sheet or my resume,

422
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,949
but here's what you
do need to know.

423
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:03,039
I have a net worth of
six million dollars.

424
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:07,174
And I also have permission
from the dean herself

425
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:10,351
to conduct this
course as I see fit.

426
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:11,308
Okay?

427
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:13,397
I'm not here to be your father.

428
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:17,488
I'm not here to teach
you some useless

429
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:21,275
stuff you'll either
never remember or forget.

430
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:23,494
I'm not here to hold your hand.

431
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:26,149
I'm here to prepare
you for life.

432
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:30,632
I want you to develop a deeper

433
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:32,895
understanding of
your inner self.

434
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:37,334
I want you to understand
your connection to others,

435
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:41,774
to everything around you,
to the people around you.

436
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:47,606
And in doing this, maybe
you'll discover your passion.

437
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:51,871
I want you to step
outside of the bubble

438
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:54,613
you've lived in your whole life.

439
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:58,486
So here's what
we're going to do.

440
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,880
I'm gonna split you up
into groups of four.

441
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:03,230
Okay, you can
choose, I don't care.

442
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:04,666
You're going to meet
with each other.

443
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,234
You're going to ask
each other questions.

444
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:08,191
You're going to get answers.

445
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:09,802
You're gonna dig deep.

446
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:10,933
Okay, you're gonna explore.

447
00:27:10,977 --> 00:27:11,934
You're gonna share ideas.

448
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,806
You're gonna share emotions.

449
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,155
You're gonna get
to know each other,

450
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:17,418
get inside each other's head.

451
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,638
And at the end of
the course I'm gonna

452
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,249
sit down with you, one on one,

453
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:27,297
and we are going to go over
your 50 minimum page paper.

454
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:29,343
No, don't groan.

455
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,347
By learning about each other
you'll learn about yourself.

456
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:37,656
I'm going to analyze them,

457
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:39,570
I'm going to ask
you some questions.

458
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:43,009
I'm gonna score them
and the highest paper

459
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:48,710
will receive a
check for $50,000.

460
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:52,279
[Students exclaiming]

461
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:54,281
Does that make it
real enough for you?

462
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:55,761
$50,000, okay?

463
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:58,981
Yeah, but here's a warning,
okay, here's a warning.

464
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:01,549
If you take this
lightly you'll fail.

465
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:07,424
If you use Wiki searches
and Google, you'll fail.

466
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,776
I want you to rely on
your group as a crutch.

467
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:12,081
Okay?

468
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:15,258
I want you to reach to
them and to discover

469
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:19,175
and explore ideas and emotions
you never could on your own,

470
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:20,350
because I want you to remember

471
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:22,091
something and this is important.

472
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:27,749
A dream that you dream
alone is just a dream.

473
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,755
But a dream that you dream
together, that's reality.

474
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,672
Welcome to college.

475
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:55,646
- Boston.

476
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,824
- Philly.

477
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:03,132
What are you doing here?

478
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:04,830
- I go here.

479
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:06,483
- Were you in that class?

480
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,572
- [Philly] Yes.

481
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:10,923
- I didn't see you.

482
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:11,750
- I was late.

483
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:13,664
I saw you.

484
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,669
- Okay, so you're
following me now?

485
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,543
Your boyfriend okay with that?

486
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:26,155
- Look, you don't know
what you're talking about,

487
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,678
so let's just leave it at that.

488
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:29,550
I just thought,
we need one more.

489
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:33,423
- You thought you'd come
over here, bat your eyes,

490
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:37,079
throw out a smile and
I'd do what you want?

491
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:37,950
- Pretty much.

492
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:43,999
- You need one, I need three.

493
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:47,873
I guess I have no choice.

494
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:48,743
- See?

495
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,093
- What about me and you?

496
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:56,795
- I mean, we met on a
random day, now we're in

497
00:29:56,838 --> 00:30:00,102
the same class with the
same crazy ass professor.

498
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:01,451
Sometimes you just gotta admit

499
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:03,018
things happen for
no reason at all.

500
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:05,542
- Easier said than
done, I guess.

501
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:09,633
What about him?

502
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:10,591
Boyfriend?

503
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:11,548
- That's G.

504
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:14,682
- G?

505
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:15,509
- G.

506
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:18,991
- Who's our fourth?

507
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:27,651
- So, how do you know him?

508
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,305
- Long story.

509
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:33,222
- Come on, drunken
hookup, baby daddy?

510
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:36,660
I know there's something
sexual going on here.

511
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:37,618
You're so out of pocket.

512
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:38,662
- Out of pocket.

513
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:41,491
[Both laughing]

514
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:43,058
- Whatever.

515
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,108
- So what do you think, G?

516
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:50,761
$50,000 dollars
is a lot of money.

517
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,373
- Not split four ways.

518
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:57,246
- Who said anything about
splitting it four ways?

519
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,117
- I know I didn't.

520
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:05,428
So how do you know her?

521
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:07,039
- Who, Philly?

522
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:07,866
- Yeah.

523
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:11,173
- Long story.

524
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:17,310
What part of Philly you from?

525
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:18,485
- Long story.

526
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:22,793
- [Rome] Grab your stuff.

527
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,320
- Oh, yes, okay.

528
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:31,324
- Hey, guys.

529
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:33,543
- [Philly] What's going on?

530
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:36,764
- Okay.

531
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:41,116
Okay, listen, we
don't have the luxury

532
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,163
of figuring out of this
is a good fit or not,

533
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:46,905
so we're just gonna have to
make it compatible, okay?

534
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:48,645
Alright?

535
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:49,951
- [Philly] Right.

536
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:52,998
- Okay, professor said
that we're gonna have to

537
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:55,696
help each other if we
wanna pass this assignment.

538
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:56,740
Alright?

539
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:00,222
So we're just gonna have to
be honest with one another,

540
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:01,571
so maybe we can
figure out what's

541
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:04,574
going on in here and in here.

542
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:06,533
[Laughs]

543
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:07,664
- [Rome] Wow.

544
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,318
- I know, alright.
- Okay.

545
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:10,450
- So, it's simple.

546
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,757
You pick a question
and you answer it.

547
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:15,585
You don't get to lie.

548
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:18,327
You just answer it and
you keep it moving.

549
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,807
Alright?

550
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,809
- What if we don't feel like
answering the questions?

551
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:23,332
- You answer 'em anyways.

552
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,335
- Too street to
answer questions, G?

553
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:30,600
- Okay, wait a minute, so
let me get this straight.

554
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:32,385
You expect us to just answer any

555
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,561
old question you put out there?

556
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:35,779
Put our business
out there for some

557
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:36,955
cash we don't even know is real?

558
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:39,914
- You know, out of
everyone at this table,

559
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,437
I'd expect that from you.

560
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:43,352
- And what the hell's
that supposed to mean?

561
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:45,006
- Okay, what's going on here?

562
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:47,400
- Ask Philly.

563
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,273
- You know what?

564
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:53,232
Yeah, I like this
game, so I'll go first.

565
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:57,410
Why'd you come to
Philadelphia, Boston?

566
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:01,849
- I don't know.

567
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:03,764
I have one for you.

568
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:07,681
When's the last time you cheated
on your boyfriend, Philly?

569
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:08,508
- Ooh.

570
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:14,209
- Okay.

571
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:19,040
- Wait, I can't do this, guys.

572
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:25,786
I am gonna be the sole reason
why you lose this thing.

573
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:30,878
I'm sorry.

574
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:31,705
- Hey, man!

575
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,055
You think you're special?

576
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:35,665
You're not!

577
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:36,927
We all have issues.

578
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:39,713
This is why we're
here, to figure it out.

579
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:41,454
Together.

580
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:47,590
- Together.

581
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,727
- Okay, everyone just
have a seat, okay?

582
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:02,779
Here, pick your question.

583
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:04,216
- I'm first?

584
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:05,043
- Yep.

585
00:34:09,873 --> 00:34:13,007
- If you could choose the
sex and physical appearance

586
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,793
of your soon-to-be
child, would you do it?

587
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:20,710
I answer, too?

588
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:22,712
- [Rye Rye] That's the point,

589
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:24,888
you answer 'em and
you keep it moving.

590
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:27,456
[All laughing]

591
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,283
- I would not.

592
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:31,156
But I'd be hoping for a guy.

593
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:33,375
- Of course.

594
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:40,600
- What do you constitute
for a perfect day?

595
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:43,081
- Aww.

596
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:46,693
- I would say just
hangin' around

597
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:50,131
people that actually
care about me.

598
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:51,001
Okay?

599
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:53,352
- Very nice.

600
00:34:55,441 --> 00:35:00,141
- Okay, so, if you
could have anyone as

601
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:03,840
your guest who would you
want as a dinner guest?

602
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:04,928
Oh my, God.

603
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:08,454
Well, I don't know.

604
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:11,457
I guess I need a
lot of laughter,

605
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,157
I think, these days, so
I'm gonna say Kevin Hart.

606
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:17,027
- Okay.

607
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:19,029
- [Rome] A dude from Philly?

608
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:19,900
- Exactly.

609
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:25,123
- Alright, what is the
worst memory that you have?

610
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:32,086
[Sobbing]

611
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,016
So,

612
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:51,888
I,

613
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,196
I am a cutter.

614
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:58,721
- What?

615
00:35:58,765 --> 00:35:59,809
- Um,

616
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:02,551
I don't like to tell people,

617
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:05,337
but it's something that
I struggle with and...

618
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:12,866
I started doing it in
high school and it gets

619
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:16,565
worse sometimes and then
other times I'm okay.

620
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:21,222
- Why?

621
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:22,615
Why do you cut?

622
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:29,622
- They say it's to help

623
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:36,106
me physically feel things
that emotionally hurt me.

624
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,242
It's a way for me to feel the
pain and let it be released.

625
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:44,724
And I don't expect
anybody to understand it

626
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:47,205
and I can't even
explain it that well.

627
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:50,077
But it's something that people

628
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,035
struggle with and
that I struggle with.

629
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:57,127
So, that's how you're
honest and that's how

630
00:36:57,171 --> 00:36:59,956
you answer the questions
and you keep it moving.

631
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,393
Alright, your turn.

632
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,570
- Okay, Rye Rye.

633
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:11,229
What would you do with the
$50,000 dollars if you won?

634
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,973
There is no money, I don't
care what you guys say.

635
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:19,106
This guy's not givin' the loot.

636
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:20,629
- Can't you be positive?

637
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:25,678
- Alright, I'd buy two
cars, one for me, one for G.

638
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:27,549
- Yes, sir.

639
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:29,682
[Girls laughing]

640
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:31,988
- [Philly] Well, we'll
just stay walking, I guess.

641
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,252
- I mean, we see you
guys. [Girls laughing]

642
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:35,601
You got gas money?

643
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:39,169
- It's not cheap, it's
not cheap in Philly.

644
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:43,783
[Professor chattering]

645
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:55,011
[soft jazz piano music]

646
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:28,088
- Listen, we came
from the bottom.

647
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:31,004
This is all we know.

648
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:33,223
Look around.

649
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:38,098
You know we can't pull stuff
in our neighborhood like this.

650
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:40,492
The boys in our hood?

651
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:44,322
They are tryin' to
rob us and kill us.

652
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:47,368
Yo, why you think I got to SUNY?

653
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,372
Sometimes you gotta fit
in just to make it out.

654
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:57,247
I got this so they
don't spot me, yo.

655
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:04,037
You feelin' me?

656
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,212
- I feel you.

657
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:18,747
[Gun firing]
[screaming]

658
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:21,881
[heartbeat thumping]

659
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,513
- What's goin' on, Philly?

660
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:46,949
How you been?

661
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:49,082
- You'd know if you
came to our meetings.

662
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:52,781
- I have things on my
mind, other classes.

663
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:56,394
- So, these classes offer 50K?

664
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:03,792
- Philly, please,
professors don't give money.

665
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:06,099
They give homework,
they give headaches.

666
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:08,580
- You give headaches.

667
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:10,451
- [Laughs] That's good.

668
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:13,106
What are you studying?

669
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:16,849
- You ain't in the class.

670
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:19,242
- I'm a pretty smart guy,
I could help you out.

671
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:25,597
[Chair scraping]

672
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,169
What we got here?

673
00:40:35,128 --> 00:40:36,912
- I think somebody
thinks he's slick.

674
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:40,307
- You got me.

675
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:45,268
- Funny, I think I can count
how times I've seen you smile.

676
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:50,186
- Some people just don't smile.

677
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:54,190
- I don't believe that.

678
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:56,454
I think something's
keeping you from smiling.

679
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:00,283
- Yeah, maybe.

680
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:06,899
- Well, trust me, you're not
gonna win the fight alone.

681
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,426
And I gotta go.

682
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:16,212
- I just got here.

683
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:17,344
- I've been here.

684
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:23,263
Excuse you.

685
00:41:29,312 --> 00:41:30,357
Bye.

686
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:57,645
- I've been to too
many of these things.

687
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,212
It never seems to get easier.

688
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,693
They never seem to
end fast enough.

689
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:05,566
- Sorry it couldn't end
fast enough for you.

690
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,525
- You know what I mean.

691
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:08,351
- Yeah.

692
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:13,574
- Look, I brought
you the game ball,

693
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:14,836
thought you might want it.

694
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,316
- Yo, put that in
the trash, man.

695
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:20,625
- You know, they told me
that you got nasty now.

696
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:22,844
Said you were a
'ticking time bomb'.

697
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,586
I don't believe 'em.

698
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,456
I still don't.

699
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:29,764
- What do you want, Coach?

700
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:31,766
- I just came by to help out.

701
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,899
Help out any way I could.

702
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:35,204
- By bringing me a ball?

703
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:39,426
- Listen Rome, I don't
have any children.

704
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:42,168
I got the team and I got a ball.

705
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:45,563
I coach because that's
all I ever wanted to do.

706
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:48,914
- Save me the speech, Coach.

707
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:50,829

I am.

1591
01:34:58,431 --> 01:34:59,737
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

1592
01:35:01,565 --> 01:35:03,698
You came into my life fast.

1593
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:10,008
I should have been thinking
about my mom, my dad.

1594
01:35:10,052 --> 01:35:11,357
I should have been mourning.

1595
01:35:11,401 --> 01:35:13,229
I know that.

1596
01:35:13,272 --> 01:35:15,666
Instead I was thinking of you.

1597
01:35:23,021 --> 01:35:25,937
I can't make you

are hard to tell apart.

1609
01:36:22,602 --> 01:36:26,302
That connection, that longing,

1610
01:36:26,345 --> 01:36:29,218
that feeling we have
for another person.

1611
01:36:30,523 --> 01:36:33,483
It's not blood that binds us.

1612
01:36:33,526 --> 01:36:37,530
It's simply the ability
to trust someone.

1613
01:36:37,574 --> 01:36:39,706
To trust someone
other than yourself.

1614
01:36:40,969 --> 01:36:42,535
That's what bonds
you to someone.

1615
01:36:44,624 --> 01:36:48,585
The connections you make
at this point in your life

1616
01:36:48,628 --> 01:36:51,806
are so important to the
person you'll become,

1617
01:36:52,937 --> 01:36:54,721
to the type of
adult you'll become,

1618
01:36:56,245 --> 01:36:58,769
perhaps the type of parent
you'll become to your child.

1619
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:01,206
And how do we do that?

1620
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:03,339
We connect by being vulnerable.

1621
01:37:04,688 --> 01:37:06,864
By opening up and
sharing our past.

1622
01:37:08,170 --> 01:37:10,259
And we all have a past.

1623

Some of them are
scarier than others.

1624
01:37:13,653 --> 01:37:16,613
Some of us have

Some of us have lost loved ones.

Some of us have fallen in love,

1627
01:37:25,622 --> 01:37:27,885
only to have our heart
broken. [Chuckles]

1628

The list goes on.

1629
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:34,587
But there's one thing that we
all, we all have in common.

1630

feel we need to gain happiness.

1635
01:37:53,737 --> 01:37:56,914
I presented you, at the
beginning of this course,

1636
01:37:56,958 --> 01:38:01,092
with the challenge of getting
to know your inner self.

1637
01:38:02,441 --> 01:38:06,358
Something we truly
cannot do as children,

1638
01:38:06,402 --> 01:38:09,405
still blind to the
horrors in the world.

1639
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:13,409
I asked you to do this by
getting to know your group.

1640
01:38:14,932 --> 01:38:17,630
By asking questions
of them, about them.

1641
01:38:19,981 --> 01:38:23,158
Getting to know them and seeing

1642
01:38:23,201 --> 01:38:28,206
yourself in their eyes,
through their eyes.

1643
01:38:29,425 --> 01:38:31,557
So you would take this
seriously I offered

the one incentive,

1645

that I knew you
could all comprehend.

- [Students] Money.

1648
01:38:40,392 --> 01:38:41,654
- Money, that's right.

1649
01:38:43,221 --> 01:38:47,922
The decision as to who won
was very, very difficult.

1650
01:38:49,053 --> 01:38:49,924
All of your papers
were wonderful

1651
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,014
and a million other adjectives

1652
01:38:53,057 --> 01:38:54,929
that really don't
need expression.

1653
01:38:55,973 --> 01:38:57,061
So I say this.

1654
01:39:01,761 --> 01:39:03,589
You're all winners.

1655
01:39:04,677 --> 01:39:05,722

1656
01:39:07,158 --> 01:39:08,768

what you've learned

greatest mysteries.

we are also born in it together.
