1
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:26,678
OK, Hailey, Nurse Annie's gonna

2
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:29,638
take your pulse and vitals
and make sure everything's OK.

3
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:32,684
And pretty soon, you'll
be better than ever.

4
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:34,643
But first, there's
a really important

5
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:37,472
matter we ought to address...

6
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:39,561
Sweet or sour?

7
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:40,475
Both!

8
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:41,432
Ah!

9
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:42,738
Both it is.

10
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:43,652
Here you go.

11
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:45,175
Thank you, Dr. Natalie.

12
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:55,664
You are going
to make a great doctor

13
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:57,057
one day but a terrible dentist.

14
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:02,627
What's wrong?

15
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:04,238
Residency deadlines
are coming up soon

16
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:05,630
and I'm still undecided.

17
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,067
You're worried?

18
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:08,197
No.

19
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:09,678
Not really.

20
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:11,308
I mean, I have worrying
penciled in for tomorrow.

21
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:13,508
Just promise
you won't overthink it.

22
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:16,989
9 out of 10 doctors say the
10th one should mellow out.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,904
Just follow your heart.

24
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:20,602
'Cause you're
thinking cardiology?

25
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:23,735
Whatever you decide,
we'll be lucky to have you.

26
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:26,390
Special delivery.

27
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,653
Bless you.

28
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:29,567
Mm.

29
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,352
Yeah.

30
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:34,224
Extra cream, no sugar, and
scorching hot, just like you.

31
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:35,941
Hmm, getting creative
with the compliments, huh?

32
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:37,358
Not at work.

33
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:38,228
People will gossip.

34
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,186
Let them talk.

35
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:40,337
I don't care who knows it.

36
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:41,666
I love you, Natalie...

37
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:43,059
Ssh.

38
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,278
I love you, too.

39
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:46,193
The kisses are
gonna have to wait.

40
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:48,891
Well, speaking of later,
how about dinner tonight?

41
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:50,197
Hmm?

42
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:52,155
Can we maybe postpone?

43
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:53,722
Aah!

44
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:56,028
You're still agonizing over
the residency deadlines?

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,159
Well, define agonizing.

46
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,910
You can laugh
because you've already

47
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:02,383
sent in your application.

48
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:04,143
True, and I should be
hearing something any time,

49
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,864
but until then, I
still got to eat.

50
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:08,737
So, dinner?

51
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,130
- OK.
- Yes!

52
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,109
And you can show me
your list of pros and cons

53
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,588
because I know you
have it written out.

54
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:15,396
No, not me.

55
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:17,137
Really?

56
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,027
Last time we had a long weekend,
you had a whole spreadsheet

57
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:20,691
and gave everyone a
personal color scheme.

58
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:21,619
OK, fine.

59
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,012
There may be a list.

60
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,666
There's the Natalie I know of.

61
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,800
Hey!

62
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:30,715
You stole that one.

63
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:32,674
See you later.

64
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:35,807
Hey, Doc, you got it bad.

65
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:37,722
What if she leaves, Annie?

66
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:40,092
I mean, what if she gets a great
residency across the country,

67
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:41,509
I'll never see her again.

68
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,773
You guys will figure
it out, whatever that is.

69
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:53,825
Incoming.

70
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,087
Thank you.

71
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:56,350
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Aah!

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,264
There she is.

73
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:58,613
Hey, no apologies.

74
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:01,093
You're here now and
that's what matters.

75
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:05,185
Hey, Scott told your dad about
you catching that lead today.

76
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:06,186
Scott called you?

77
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:07,187
You know Scott.

78
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:08,492
He's proud of you.

79
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:09,928
We all are.

80
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,059
You missed dinner.

81
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:12,540
Mom made her famous meatloaf.

82
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,670
Oh, sorry I missed that.

83
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,020
Ooh!

84
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:15,760
- I can heat some up for you.
- Oh, no.

85
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:17,109
It's fine.

86
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,560
I just mean, I
actually have plans

87
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:19,503
with Scott so I'm not staying.

88
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,766
Oh.

89
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,507
Has he heard about
his residency?

90
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,161
Oh, not yet.

91
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:28,773
But you know, in true Scott
fashion, he's not worried.

92
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:30,384
I gotta go.

93
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:31,514
I've got homework.

94
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:39,262
Uh, you should talk to her.

95
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:41,046
Is everything OK?

96
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:42,570
Yeah.

97
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,704
It's just... she was
looking forward to tonight.

98
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:47,966
She misses you.

99
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,205
I really meant
to be here sooner.

100
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:49,968
Sorry.

101
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:50,926
I know, sweetheart.

102
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:53,102
Just go talk it out.

103
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:02,981
Hey.

104
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:04,679
Hi.

105
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:06,613
Do you have some clothes
I could borrow for my date

106
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:07,464
tonight.

107
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:10,815
All I have are my scrubs.

108
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:24,699
Hmm, mm.

109
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,178
Oh, too blue.

110
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,389
That's your favorite color.

111
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:34,099
You have really great taste.

112
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,406
I know you're all
grown up now but to me,

113
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,384
it seems like you were
turning 10 just yesterday.

114
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:39,975
Ah, you always say that.

115
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:42,543
I'm almost 18.

116
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:45,415
How's Cameron.

117
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:46,546
We broke up.

118
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,330
What?

119
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:48,636
When?

120
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:50,638
About three months ago.

121
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:53,815
Abby, why didn't you tell me?

122
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,120
I don't know.

123
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,600
I don't want to bother you.

124
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:59,734
You're busy with
school and everything.

125
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,866
You can always talk to me.

126
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:04,086
Even if I don't have a
solution, I can at least

127
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:07,872
admire the problem from afar.

128
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:10,658
Talk to me.

129
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,679
I'm just worried that I'm
never gonna have a relationship

130
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,226
like you and Scott.

131
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:17,491
OK, I didn't meet Scott
until medical school so

132
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:21,843
give it a few years before you
declare yourself a spinster.

133
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,932
I just want what you guys have.

134
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,237
Do you think he'll propose?

135
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:26,413
Ooh, no, no.

136
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:27,718
Not now.

137
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,982
No, we still have
a lot to figure out

138
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:32,549
before we talk about marriage.

139
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,160
But you love him.

140
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,901
I really do.

141
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:38,903
Like, everything about him.

142
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:43,168
Which is crazy considering
how opposite we are.

143
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,519
He can't hide one
single emotion,

144
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,608
and he jumps in with
both feet while I'm

145
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:51,263
still like dipping my toe.

146
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,135
The emotion thing
gets him into trouble,

147
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:56,094
but it's also very charming.

148
00:05:56,225 --> 00:06:00,882
And he's always
late, like he is now.

149
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:05,365
He really is the
yin to your yang.

150
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,279
Oh.

151
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,544
This is the one.

152
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:11,674
Ooh.

153
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:14,896
Fancy.

154
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:17,594
Mm.

155
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:21,163
Oh, you know I'm the president
of the premed club at school?

156
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:22,382
Of course.

157
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:23,592
Well on Friday, we're having

158
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,123
a career fair kind of thing.

159
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:26,710
I was wondering if you
could come in and talk

160
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:28,170
to some of the students?

161
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,626
Just answer questions about
medical school and stuff

162
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,868
like that?

163
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,870
I'd love to, Abby,
but I can't Friday.

164
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,830
I have rotations.

165
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,267
Semester is almost
over and pretty soon,

166
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,558
I'll have a lot of free time.

167
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:42,358
So next career
fair, I'll be there.

168
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:47,842
I promise.

169
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:50,279
It's OK.

170
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,498
I understand.

171
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:08,776
Mm.

172
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,995
Ah, smell that?

173
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:12,606
Next batch is done.

174
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,616
How do you know?
The timer hasn't even gone off.

175
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:16,392
Hahaha.

176
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:17,524
I don't need a timer.

177
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:19,177
The nose knows.

178
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:20,962
OK, Doctor Seuss, my nose

179
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:23,921
has no idea when I'm supposed
to take cookies out of the oven.

180
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:25,052
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

181
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,011
Don't you dare.

182
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:29,361
Did somebody say cookies?

183
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:30,493
- Hey!
- Hey.

184
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:31,407
Great to see you, pal.

185
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,148
Good to see you, sir.

186
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:34,410
Hi, you're late.

187
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,541
Mm, you sure about that?

188
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:36,709
Because I think I'm right...

189
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:40,677
-on time.

190
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:42,984
Mm, cookies are amazing, Janine.

191
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,855
Well, you can
eat as many as you want.

192
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:45,726
Oh, I will.

193
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:46,640
Mwah.

194
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,859
Hey, kiddo.

195
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,861
Hey, oh.

196
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:51,732
Ah, one more thing.

197
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,342
Mm?

198
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,667
You have shared this
recipe with Natalie, right?

199
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:55,779
Uh, yes.

200
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,693
Well, she's been
helping me since she

201
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:57,825
was a little girl, so...

202
00:07:57,955 --> 00:07:59,957
I can hear you.

203
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:03,265
I think we're
gonna get outta here.

204
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:05,354
Ah.

205
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,660
- Bye.
- Have a good night.

206
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,854
- See you later.
- I love you, too.

207
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:08,705
Thank you, sir.

208
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:09,836
Have a great night, guys.

209
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:30,529
Well, I don't
understand how he does

210
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,163
that and baking.

211
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:36,124
Yeah, those
cookies, the death of me.

212
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:38,213
Are you even hungry
for food right now?

213
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:40,258
Ah, you know me.

214
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,389
I do know you.

215
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,003
Sorry, I'm... my mind's racing.

216
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:49,833
I had no idea that applying for
residency's could be this hard.

217
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:51,644
Maybe it's good not
to have a plan for once

218
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:53,924
and just let things happen.

219
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:55,535
Mm.

220
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:57,754
Forget about the deadline,
stress, and look inside.

221
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:02,237
We should find out right now.

222
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,367
Mm?

223
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,370
I love working with children.

224
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,590
I really like geriatrics, too.

225
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:08,983
And?

226
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:10,941
It just feels really
good to help people.

227
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:14,684
What about surgery?

228
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:19,123
I love that rotation but I
want more patient interaction.

229
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:21,430
See, that's what I
love about you, Natalie.

230
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,826
You just wanna help people
and you're so good at it, too.

231
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:28,524
I know you're worried about
the future but I'm not.

232
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:31,135
You're so smart and so
passionate and so beautiful...

233
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,617
- and I can't imagine
my life without you.

234
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:35,487
Oh... no...

235
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,488
Natalie... no.

236
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:39,622
I love you so much.

237
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:41,493
I think you love me, too.

238
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:42,625
I do, Scott.

239
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,496
See, that's perfect.

240
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:45,802
Oh, Scott, why'd you just...

241
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,021
Hold on, hold on.

242
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:50,677
Just let me do this.

243
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:55,203
Natalie Sims, will you marry me?

244
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,954
I can't.

245
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:07,911
I'm sorry, what?

246
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,260
I can't.

247
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,542
There's too much uncertainty...

248
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:11,741
You...
right now, we...

249
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:13,308
-can't?

250
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:14,764
Can't even begin
to think about marriage.

251
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:15,527
I... I thought we
wanted the same thing?

252
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:16,224
- We do.
- So...

253
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:17,051
I mean, I do...

254
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,008
I do... I don't...

255
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,140
I don't.
Aah!

256
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,315
I don't know.

257
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,752
What I'm...

258
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:23,883
Uh...

259
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:30,455
-so, you won't marry me?

260
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,850
No.

261
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,988
Scott, I... I love you, but I...

262
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,338
But you said no.

263
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:44,828
Can we just go
back to five minutes

264
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:46,622
ago before any of this
ever happened and have...

265
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,169
I, uh...

266
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,277
- a conversation or... or...
Or... uh, this is the first

267
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:51,607
time we even talked about it.

268
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:55,698
I gotta go.

269
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:59,093
Scott, wait.

270
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:00,224
We can talk about this.

271
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:02,009
I've... I gotta go.

272
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,945
Congratulations, you guys.

273
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:26,075
It's about time!

274
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:30,840
Do you mind if
I talk to Natalie?

275
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:31,952
Sure.

276
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:33,482
I'll leave you guys
alone for a bit.

277
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:41,352
I told her I
was thinking of prop...

278
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:44,399
Well, you know.

279
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:46,662
Don't worry, she's
the one I told, uh...

280
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:50,927
Do you mind if I, uh, talk
to you about something?

281
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:52,973
Yeah, I think we should talk.

282
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,103
Somewhere private?

283
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:16,300
I got a call today from
the residency in Chicago.

284
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,649
They wanna fly me
out to meet the team.

285
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:28,051
If I go, it will be a
three-year contract minimum.

286
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,357
Wow!

287
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:32,360
Scott, that's an
incredible opportunity.

288
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,842
Congratulations.

289
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,627
Chicago, that's far.

290
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:44,807
Yeah I was gonna decline
when my circumstances changed.

291
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:52,938
So... Our flight leaves tomorrow.

292
00:13:06,263 --> 00:13:07,263
Scott, wait.

293
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:37,338
Well, honey, uh...

294
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:38,818
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

295
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:39,731
Come on.

296
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:40,862
Come on.

297
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:49,045
I just didn't
know who else to talk to, Mimi.

298
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,743
I'm scared to tell Mom and
Dad because they love Scott.

299
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,745
Well, honey, they love you, too.

300
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,009
I know, but...

301
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,880
Hey, it's going to be fine.

302
00:13:58,011 --> 00:13:59,011
Talk to me.

303
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:05,583
How can I ask him to stay
when I've already told him no?

304
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:07,368
Do you want him to stay?

305
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:08,649
- I don't want him to go.
- Uh-huh.

306
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:09,673
And do you love him?

307
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:10,980
Yes!

308
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:12,175
Now, but you
don't wanna marry him?

309
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,548
- No.
- No.

310
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:14,678
No, I don't...

311
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,464
I don't know.

312
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:18,727
Things just aren't going
at the way that I planned.

313
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,860
Well, they never do.

314
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,252
That's life.

315
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,951
I mean, I don't even
know what I'm doing.

316
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:28,389
I feel like everything
is just falling apart.

317
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,044
You know, I'm facing the
biggest decision of my life

318
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:34,134
and he just goes and
proposes like that?

319
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:37,137
I mean, what was he thinking?

320
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:40,488
Well, I... uh, well, what
do you think, Natalie?

321
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:43,012
What do you want?

322
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:44,143
I don't know.

323
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,190
That's the problem.

324
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:55,111
I just wish that I knew how
this was supposed to go.

325
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:56,242
Ah, yeah.

326
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:01,726
Uncertainty, it's very
uncomfortable, honey.

327
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:10,257
But, honey, I... I think I know
something that might help.

328
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:11,606
I don't want any more bons.

329
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:16,524
No, not bonbons.

330
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:19,527
But you're going
to think I'm crazy.

331
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:21,485
Watch your step, honey.

332
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:22,616
Come on.

333
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:29,929
Where... here it is.

334
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:38,502
Is that yours?

335
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,157
Mm-hmm.

336
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:42,289
It's beautiful.

337
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:43,419
Yeah.

338
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:51,428
Before I married your grandpa,
I was so nervous I almost

339
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,301
didn't make it down the aisle.

340
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:55,998
You were nervous?

341
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:59,436
I would have never thought that
watching you two growing up.

342
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:07,567
Well, marrying him was the
best decision I ever made.

343
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:13,407
But there was a time when I
wasn't so sure he was the one,

344
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:16,062
or that I was ready
to be anybody's wife.

345
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:21,371
You know, I was 22 and my whole
future was in front of me,

346
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:24,592
and I just... there
was so much pressure.

347
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:26,986
Well, you said yes.

348
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:28,116
What helped you decide?

349
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:33,513
This veil.

350
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,741
I know it sounds silly, but when
I tried this veil on, I just...

351
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,272
I just had this
feeling that I could

352
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:50,357
see my whole future unfold
in front of me and I...

353
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:53,751
I liked what I saw.

354
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:57,059
And after that, I was sure.

355
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:03,283
Try it on.

356
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:05,502
Mimi, I don't see how
trying on a wedding veil

357
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,200
is gonna fix my
problems with Scott.

358
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,029
Oh, honey, I don't know,
but there's just something

359
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:11,378
about this whole veil.

360
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:15,686
It just seems to make
things more clear.

361
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:17,340
So humor me.

362
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:18,950
Come on, try it on.

363
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:34,575
You look so beautiful.

364
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:37,186
How does it feel?

365
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:38,448
I feel silly.

366
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:42,496
Tsk, Natalie, for
once, don't think.

367
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:45,673
Just feel.

368
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:46,935
I won't tell anyone.

369
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:01,602
Oh, Mimi.

370
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:03,169
Mm.

371
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,299
Mimi?

372
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,172
Mimi?

373
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,438
Hey.

374
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:12,787
Ooh, I love that scarf.

375
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,112
It reminds me of our honeymoon.

376
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,790
Mm.

377
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,660
Uh, honey...

378
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,054
Traffic jam!

379
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:21,491
Daddy, I thought we could
make pancakes for snack time.

380
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:22,927
Pancakes!
Pancakes!

381
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:24,253
All right, what do you
want in your pancakes?

382
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:25,558
- Chocolate chips!
- Chocolate Chips?

383
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:27,106
- Chocolate chips!
- Or blueberries?

384
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,759
- Yeah, strawberry.
- All right.

385
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,259
All right, will you take your
car and you take you car,

386
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:31,153
so Mommy and I won't...

387
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:32,415
-slip anymore.

388
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:39,118
Honey?

389
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:40,641
Hey.

390
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:41,771
Scott.

391
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:44,645
Oh, it's the weirdest dream.

392
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:49,258
We're at this house and
there are these two kids.

393
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:55,743
Something very
strange is going on.

394
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:57,310
Oh, you're right about that.

395
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,703
I'm calling Dr. Hammond,
getting you in right away.

396
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:00,661
Oh, I'm fine.

397
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,098
I'm... I'm just, um...

398
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:07,537
I'm just overwhelmed
or... or something.

399
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:09,235
Mommy, say, ah.

400
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:10,365
Oh.

401
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:14,456
Silly Mommy.

402
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,852
Where's Grandma Mimi?

403
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:19,810
Is Grandma Mimi coming over?

404
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,116
What, she's not here?

405
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:22,030
No.

406
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,119
She's probably at home.

407
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,250
Which is?

408
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:26,121
What?

409
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:28,297
Home, where is that?

410
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:30,908
Grandma Mimi moved, Mommy.

411
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,565
This... this...
This can't be real.

412
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:36,784
I...
- Oh.

413
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:37,914
Oh, uh...
- I'm...

414
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,961
Oh, oh, easy.

415
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:41,615
You hit your head
pretty hard there.

416
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,070
I really think we
should go to the clinic.

417
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:43,878
No, I'm just...

418
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:44,879
I'm sorry, I'm just...

419
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:47,011
I'm not feeling very well.

420
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:48,142
Hey, I understand.

421
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,467
You've been going at it nonstop.

422
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:52,147
Just... did you eat
anything today?

423
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:53,322
Ah...

424
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:54,773
You probably have
low blood sugar.

425
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:56,412
I just need to lie down.

426
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,587
Yep.

427
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,937
Yeah.

428
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:01,243
Your mom is coming over.

429
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:02,525
I can call her to
cancel if you want.

430
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:03,419
No, I wanna see her.

431
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,595
I... I need to.

432
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:09,208
Uh, power nap, I
guess what I need.

433
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:10,078
Ooh.

434
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,209
Uh, I'm sorry.

435
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:26,399
Is Mom having another baby?

436
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,009
What?

437
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:29,880
Well, what makes
you say that, goober?

438
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:32,187
Because the last
time she was like this

439
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,406
is when she had Dylan.

440
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,538
Remember, you called
it baby brain?

441
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,714
Oh, I don't think so.

442
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:39,803
Can I get a baby
sister this time?

443
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:42,197
No, that, um, mm-mm, there's...

444
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:45,592
That's... sorry, um...

445
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:46,722
Emma.

446
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,773
Everybody, be good.

447
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:01,042
Hello?

448
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:02,696
Annie?

449
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:03,890
You are not gonna believe
what I'm about to tell you,

450
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,046
but I had...

451
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,308
NURSE ANNIE: Who is this...

452
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,571
- and how do you
have my cell phone?

453
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:09,703
It's Natalie.

454
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,922
Natalie Sims.

455
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:12,793
No.

456
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:14,534
Yes.

457
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:17,145
Natalie Sims, fourth year
medical student dating Scott.

458
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,712
Natalie?

459
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:21,541
I haven't heard from you
in over 10 years, at least.

460
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:22,977
10 years... wh...

461
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:24,674
OK, we spoke this morning.

462
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,459
And what do
you mean, dating Scott?

463
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:28,243
I was at your wedding.

464
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,897
Is everything all right?

465
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:31,027
I don't know.

466
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:33,379
Uh, I'm really confused, Annie.

467
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:35,076
Something happened.

468
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:36,619
Look, I'm really
happy to hear from you,

469
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:38,098
but if you're having
a medical emergency,

470
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:42,692
I suggest you hang
up and dial 911.

471
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:44,215
Ah!

472
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,346
Hello?

473
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:51,787
OK.

474
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,966
Think.

475
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:57,097
I am not crazy.

476
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,974
What was the last thing I did?

477
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,105
Retrace your steps.

478
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,719
The veil.

479
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:12,808
The veil!

480
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:17,901
OK.

481
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:19,468
Where is this thing?

482
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,650
Bingo.

483
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:31,914
All righty.

484
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,919
Let's try this again.

485
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:43,971
Ugh!

486
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:44,928
Oh, good.

487
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,843
You got Mimi's veil.

488
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,323
Oh, my sweet girl.

489
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:49,933
What's wrong?

490
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:51,848
I'm so happy to see
you but you're not gonna

491
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:53,241
believe what is happening.

492
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,330
Oh, well try me.

493
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:57,463
OK, this is gonna sound crazy,

494
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,421
but I don't know how I got here.

495
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:01,660
I mean, one minute, this attic
was still Grandma Mimi's house

496
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,445
and she was insisting
that I try on this veil.

497
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:04,663
And the next thing
I know, I wake up

498
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:06,646
and I have two
kids and a husband.

499
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:07,560
Oh, my gosh.

500
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,866
I sound crazy.

501
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:10,780
No.

502
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:12,478
Not exactly.

503
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:14,088
Oh, so you know?

504
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:16,830
Of course I know.

505
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,615
Oh, time flies.

506
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:22,705
We're all feeling
sentimental right now.

507
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:25,578
One moment, you're holding
little baby in your arms,

508
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,189
and the next minute, they're
raising babies of their own

509
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,583
or getting married.

510
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:34,978
It can seem so unfair sometimes
how quickly life goes by.

511
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:40,201
But every chapter is
beautiful and just keeps

512
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:43,944
getting better and better.

513
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:45,119
I miss you.

514
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:46,076
Oh.

515
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:47,426
Oh.

516
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,950
I'm so sorry that
I'm not around more.

517
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,907
What do you mean?

518
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,344
I see you almost everyday.

519
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,563
You do?

520
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:57,958
Are you feeling OK, Natalie?

521
00:23:58,088 --> 00:23:59,438
Look, uh, Scott said you...

522
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:01,048
You hit your head.

523
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:04,747
He thought it was OK but
maybe you should take it easy.

524
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:07,533
No, I just need to see Mimi.

525
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:09,839
Well, you're going to see
her at the dress fitting.

526
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,928
What dress fitting?

527
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,669
Now you're just
trying to scare me.

528
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,933
I don't know why you
girls think that's so funny.

529
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:19,675
One of these days, you're gonna
be saying something serious,

530
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:20,957
I'm just gonna
think it's a joke.

531
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,373
Come on, we're gonna be late.

532
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,384
We don't wanna stress out
your sister even more.

533
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:33,341
And I... I think she
likes this drop.

534
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,908
We might consider this for her.

535
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:36,387
I know.

536
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,038
I guess there's
something we could put,

537
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,584
um, some fruit or raspberries
or strawberries inside.

538
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,480
Yeah.

539
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,307
To the mother and
sister of the bride,

540
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:44,459
you're doing all the work.

541
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,483
Mm.

542
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:51,185
Ah.

543
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:53,317
Oh!

544
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:56,146
Abby!

545
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:57,713
Oh my goodness, not again.

546
00:24:57,844 --> 00:24:59,149
You promised no more tears.

547
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:08,811
Oh.

548
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:10,596
I know, I'm so grown up.

549
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:12,989
It just feels a little unreal.

550
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,644
So did you bring it?

551
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:16,950
Did I bring what?

552
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,473
Grandma Mimi's veil?

553
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:19,798
We're supposed to see the
full look today, right?

554
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:20,867
Uh, I forgot.

555
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:21,824
I'm sorry.

556
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:22,738
No, no.

557
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:24,044
I've... I just had it.

558
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:25,349
I forgot it, that's all.

559
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,090
I... no, no, no, it's
in perfectly good

560
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:28,004
working condition.

561
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:29,397
Was that a concern?

562
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,616
No.
No.

563
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:31,486
Of course, I didn't...

564
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,314
Hey, it's fine, honey.

565
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:36,752
You're so beautiful.

566
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:41,583
And everything is
going to be just fine.

567
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:42,976
Sorry.

568
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:45,631
The stress is
starting to get to me.

569
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,328
But it's OK.

570
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:50,287
Mistakes happen and you've
done so much for me, Natalie.

571
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:51,811
I have?

572
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:53,726
OK, if you're
gonna make me say it,

573
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:56,163
you're the best
sister in the world?

574
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:57,293
There, you happy?

575
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:03,169
Whew!

576
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:17,184
So, do you like what you see?

577
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:19,447
So I haven't
completely lost my mind.

578
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,578
No, honey.

579
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,320
I'm telling you, it is the veil.

580
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:27,542
Sometimes, it just helps
to have a little clarity.

581
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,718
Why did it bring me here?

582
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:34,027
Well, you can't go back
until all is revealed.

583
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:36,246
So far, the only thing
that's been revealed to me

584
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:38,422
is two kids running
around in a house

585
00:26:38,553 --> 00:26:42,209
calling me Mommy and a very
concerned and confused Scott.

586
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:46,822
And... is that
what I'm supposed to see?

587
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:48,084
I suppose.

588
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:49,520
You'll know when you know.

589
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:50,521
OK.

590
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,567
I have residency deadlines.

591
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:54,917
What if I get
stuck here forever?

592
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:58,529
You must trust the journey.

593
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:18,114
Hey.

594
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:19,333
Hey.

595
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:21,422
So how was your day?

596
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:25,513
Um, surreal but good.

597
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,404
Well, I know things have
been stressful with wedding

598
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,778
planning, and the
kids, and work, so

599
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:34,217
I figured we go to our
old medical school refuge.

600
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:35,542
What, is this because I fainted?

601
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:36,698
Because Scott, I'm...

602
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:38,395
I'm fine, really.

603
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:42,878
As your doctor, Doctor, I'm
prescribing you a night off.

604
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:44,009
Come on.

605
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:53,802
This place hasn't changed a bit.

606
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:56,152
You can always count on it.

607
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:57,763
Let me guess, you
ordered the BLT?

608
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,634
You're getting the
chicken sandwich.

609
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:00,940
Can always count on it.

610
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,421
Do you remember?

611
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:06,641
Our first date was here, too.

612
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:08,469
What? that was our first date?

613
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:12,125
Well, technically.

614
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:15,868
I, uh, I would really like
to study with you sometime.

615
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:18,044
I tend to learn
better in groups.

616
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:19,872
Mm.

617
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:23,223
I think I was just a
little smoother than that.

618
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:25,616
Um, I think you...

619
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:28,794
I think... no, you asked
me over a CPR dummy.

620
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,796
Oh, boy.

621
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:33,494
Can we please tell
the kids my version?

622
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:36,845
I'll give you a do over.

623
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:39,543
Hi, I'm Natalie.

624
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:42,242
I'm so glad that you
asked me to study.

625
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:44,461
You are incredibly good
with a stethoscope.

626
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:46,028
Oh, why, thank you.

627
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,353
And I want you to know the study

628
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:50,293
session is purely intellectual.

629
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:53,340
So what do you like to do
for fun these days, Scott?

630
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,169
Oh, there's a date
night, family movie night,

631
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:57,474
dancing in the kitchen.

632
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:58,780
Mm.

633
00:28:58,911 --> 00:29:00,869
That sounds boring.

634
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,610
No, it's perfect.

635
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,959
Why?

636
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,589
There's no cover
charge for Club Kitchen.

637
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:07,310
And DJ Scott is amazing.

638
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,361
But why, really?

639
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:17,059
We get to do what we always
dreamed of in our careers.

640
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,760
We get to help people, have
a home filled with laughter.

641
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,587
I sometimes get caught
up in the day by day

642
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:27,026
but we should all be so lucky.

643
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:28,156
Do you get out?

644
00:29:28,244 --> 00:29:30,377
Oh, like this?

645
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:31,900
Do you travel?

646
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:33,119
You mean, like Hawaii?

647
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:34,249
I did.

648
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:35,337
Who doesn't it.

649
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:38,602
So many questions.

650
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,691
Well, this is a first
date, Scotty Smooth.

651
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:44,957
Any regrets?

652
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:48,961
My only regret is not ordering
that chicken sandwich two

653
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:50,789
years ago when you claimed it.

654
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,442
You can still order one.

655
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:54,705
Now there'd be nothing to share.

656
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:55,836
Where's the fun in that?

657
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:04,280
Not on the first date.

658
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:07,414
Maybe, we can do
it again sometime.

659
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:08,584
What are we studying next?

660
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:10,330
It's a surprise.

661
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:16,007
Do you ever wish that you
had waited to see what

662
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,425
your career was gonna do first?

663
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:20,446
I always figured it was
better to follow your heart

664
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,560
rather than to have it
told what's possible.

665
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,258
Yeah, but how
did you know... like

666
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:29,523
really know that you're
making the right decision?

667
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:33,570
It sounds like you
got a lot on your mind.

668
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:36,356
I just feel like I
can't get ahead of things.

669
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:38,924
Know what to do for sure no
matter how much I put in...

670
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:42,536
You put in your spreadsheets.

671
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,103
I guess I don't change.

672
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:46,453
But you act like
that's a bad thing.

673
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:49,760
Without you, we'd always be
out of something at the house,

674
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,458
right?

675
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:54,156
And even on top of Abby's
wedding planning like a boss.

676
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:57,072
I have...

677
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:58,203
I have.

678
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:03,034
It's a nice night.

679
00:31:05,994 --> 00:31:07,561
Ooh, we gotta get back.

680
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:09,345
Save your parents
from babysitting.

681
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:29,930
Impressed?

682
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:33,065
Maybe just a little.

683
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:37,504
You know, your mom warned
you about guys like me.

684
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:39,114
And I didn't listen.

685
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:40,899
Apparently not.

686
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:45,294
Computer, swing the house down!

687
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:46,817
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Oh, yes.

688
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:47,557
- No.
No...

689
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:48,471
- Oh...
- oh...

690
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:48,950
-it's gonna happen.

691
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:50,081
OK.

692
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,693
Here we go.

693
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:54,434
Oh!

694
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:55,564
Um, Scott?

695
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:56,609
Yes, dear?

696
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:58,003
The blood's rising to my head.

697
00:31:58,133 --> 00:31:59,613
Well, that explains
your healthy glow.

698
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:04,357
Um, let's just...

699
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:07,273
Yeah, I... I think
that's enough dancing.

700
00:32:07,403 --> 00:32:08,963
I don't know how to
explain this but I...

701
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:12,887
I'm not who you think I am.

702
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:14,976
The... the woman in this
picture, that's not me.

703
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:17,805
I'm not her.

704
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,635
Hey, I get it.

705
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:22,765
Hah, you do?

706
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:23,898
Yeah.

707
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,640
I mean our lives
are pretty crazy.

708
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,772
Yesterday, we were a couple
of kids in med school.

709
00:32:28,903 --> 00:32:31,862
And now we got a mortgage,
and laundry, and endless piles

710
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,387
of dishes, and boom!

711
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:36,693
Just like that.

712
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:41,002
But, hey, we got this.

713
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,133
Yeah.

714
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:51,752
So...

715
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:57,714
Hey.

716
00:32:57,845 --> 00:33:00,717
So, uh, Dylan had trouble
falling asleep again tonight.

717
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:02,632
He has a test tomorrow
and he's letting

718
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:03,783
his nerves get the best of him.

719
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:06,332
Wait, Dylan has test anxiety?

720
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:07,594
We've been over this.

721
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:09,204
He's the smartest
kid in his class.

722
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:10,442
He just gets a little nervous
every once in a while.

723
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,866
Well, I had the
same thing as a kid.

724
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,226
We need to do
something about it.

725
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:14,707
I don't know, get him
a tutor or something.

726
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:15,994
We already tried that.

727
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:17,580
Look, if we just let
it go, he'll be fine.

728
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:19,258
He'll grow out of it.

729
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:20,259
No, he won't.

730
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:22,652
Trust me.

731
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:25,003
Look, I really don't wanna
fight about this tonight, OK?

732
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:30,398
Come here.

733
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
Come here.

734
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:44,196
I missed you today.

735
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:45,326
You, too.

736
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,594
Can you drop the
kids off at school

737
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,596
on your way to work tomorrow?

738
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:55,642
Work?

739
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:56,904
Yeah.

740
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,273
You know, that thing
we do to afford

741
00:33:58,297 --> 00:34:00,603
a nice life in the suburbs?

742
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,083
Right.

743
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:03,432
Work tomorrow.

744
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:05,260
Mm-hmm.

745
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:06,740
I am gonna go pick out something

746
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,047
to wear for work tomorrow.

747
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:24,801
Everything OK in there?

748
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:25,933
Yeah, fine.

749
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,064
I'm fine.

750
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,428
Good morning, Doctor.

751
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:43,994
Morning.

752
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,125
Doctor.

753
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,279
Dr. Rivers.

754
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:08,193
Hello.

755
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,978
Sorry, yes, Rachel.

756
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,458
What are you Still down here?

757
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:13,807
Working.

758
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:15,113
I know, but it's Tuesday.

759
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:16,810
What, we don't work on Tuesdays?

760
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,725
No, we do, but you're
usually out of here

761
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:19,855
by now for date night.

762
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:25,514
Date night, every
Tuesday with Scott.

763
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:28,038
Are you feeling OK?

764
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:29,823
Dr. Rivers, the
other one, mentioned

765
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:31,041
that you hit your head?

766
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,304
I did.

767
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:35,437
It's just... it's
just been a long day.

768
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:36,569
Sure, I get it.

769
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,266
Great job today by the way.

770
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:40,549
I've never seen someone make
a child laugh while sticking

771
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:41,573
a needle in their arm.

772
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:43,924
Thanks, Rachel.

773
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:48,624
Scott, honey.

774
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:49,625
Hey.

775
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,105
You almost home?

776
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:52,474
Your mom will be here
soon to watch the kids.

777
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:55,501
Can we reschedule?

778
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:58,199
We haven't missed a
date night in 10 years.

779
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,766
I just... I can't right now.

780
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:02,595
I still have so much work to do.

781
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:04,379
It's, um... It's OK.

782
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:09,297
Well, uh, I'll just see
you when you get home.

783
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:11,560
I love you.

784
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:13,823
I love you, too.

785
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:31,537
Hey.

786
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:32,667
Hey.

787
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:34,061
Did you get my text?

788
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,672
No, sorry, I haven't
looked at my phone.

789
00:36:36,803 --> 00:36:39,153
Oh, apparently, Emma
has a project due tomorrow

790
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:41,155
she hasn't started on.

791
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:42,896
Oh.

792
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:45,812
But I rounded up some supplies
and we're gonna dish it out.

793
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:48,249
What, are you just gonna throw
something together for her?

794
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,860
I mean, what if she
fails her project?

795
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,513
Oh, she won't fail.

796
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:55,082
But maybe, she'll learn to
be more prepared next time.

797
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,477
How are you always
so calm about this stuff?

798
00:36:58,607 --> 00:36:59,671
How was I supposed to feel?

799
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:00,695
It'll be fine.

800
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:06,311
Hey, I'm sorry about tonight.

801
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
It's fine.

802
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,275
All right.

803
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,799
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

804
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,896
Emma, you want Popsicle
sticks or fuzzy sticks?

805
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,027
Um...

806
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:29,682
Look, I think Popsicle sticks.

807
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:13,786
Where are the kids?

808
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:15,614
It's after 9:00.

809
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:16,832
You fell asleep.

810
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:18,399
Yeah.

811
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,184
Thank you.

812
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:22,595
So did Emma finished
her project?

813
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:29,323
It's a little
rushed, but it's done.

814
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:32,935
I guess I really
screwed up today, huh?

815
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:36,374
Well, you know, yes, you did.

816
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:43,555
Natalie, if something's
going on, talk to me.

817
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:46,993
Well, there is
something going on.

818
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:48,473
I knew it.

819
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:50,059
I'm scheduling a CT scan
first thing tomorrow.

820
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:51,345
Oh, it's not that.

821
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:56,916
I just feel like I'm
letting everybody down.

822
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,183
Well, then, I'd love
to agree with you,

823
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:05,838
but then, we'd both be wrong.

824
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:17,458
I know you're under a lot of
pressure, but you're not alone.

825
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:19,721
We're in this together,
we're figuring it out.

826
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:20,852
All right?

827
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:30,099
I'll take the kids to
school tomorrow morning

828
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:31,298
so you could sleep in a bit.

829
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,736
So you have another
busy day tomorrow?

830
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:36,042
I'm sure I do.

831
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:47,662
I know.

832
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:49,011
I don't like...

833
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:50,641
I'm not a fan of the
pecans in the cake.

834
00:40:50,665 --> 00:40:51,405
I mean...

835
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:54,887
Well, I like that.

836
00:40:55,017 --> 00:40:57,846
Got an easy solution.

837
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:59,326
So what do you think?

838
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,893
We've been here,
uh, three hours.

839
00:41:01,023 --> 00:41:02,023
You might want to...

840
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:03,069
I know but I like both.

841
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,810
Like, I really like...

842
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,595
It's between these two.

843
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:10,729
Well, there's an obvious
solution if you can't decide

844
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:13,166
between one and the other.

845
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:14,428
OK.

846
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,344
So we'll do one
layer of red velvet

847
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,346
and another one
of Italian cream.

848
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,739
Ta-da!
- Right?

849
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:21,696
Mm-hmm.

850
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:24,177
OK.

851
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:25,961
Everything's gonna
be perfect, right?

852
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:28,573
Of course.

853
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:31,184
I just hope Brian and I can
have what you and Scott have.

854
00:41:31,314 --> 00:41:32,838
Oh.

855
00:41:32,968 --> 00:41:34,903
OK, this whole thing could
fall apart at any second.

856
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:36,015
What?

857
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:36,929
I'm serious.

858
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:37,799
No.

859
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,497
I know.

860
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:44,284
With each choice, each decision,
you just put love first

861
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:45,981
and try and hold it together.

862
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:50,725
I have it under control.

863
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:51,856
I won't let you down.

864
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:08,047
I guess you have more to reveal.

865
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:13,139
Feeling nostalgic?

866
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:14,967
I am, too.

867
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:16,403
All this wedding stuff.

868
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:23,149
Is this what you wanted?

869
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:25,151
What do you mean?

870
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:27,109
This life.

871
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,896
When you asked me to marry you,
is this the life you imagined?

872
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:34,029
No, it's better than I imagined.

873
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,267
I wouldn't want
it any other way.

874
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:36,291
Mwah!

875
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:41,341
So I talked to the school
counselor about Dylan

876
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:45,563
and she wants us to come
in tomorrow for a meeting.

877
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:47,826
OK.

878
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:49,958
Well, it is a good thing.

879
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:53,832
Maybe we'll find a solution and
now actually get some sleep.

880
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:55,050
Ah!

881
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:56,965
That would be amazing.

882
00:42:57,096 --> 00:42:59,533
Well then, yeah,
wouldn't that so good.

883
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:02,144
Mommy, test tomorrow.

884
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:03,450
Daddy...

885
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,060
Sure this is the
life you imagined?

886
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:06,191
Of course.

887
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:11,284
We went out.

888
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:14,853
No, that was a study session.

889
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:15,984
All right.

890
00:43:16,115 --> 00:43:17,115
Wait here.

891
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:17,899
One sec.

892
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,030
Scott...

893
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:33,393
You said you
wanted a second study session.

894
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:34,742
This is kind of our thing.

895
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:39,181
Well done, sir.

896
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:52,934
What?

897
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:56,024
It's just... this reminds
me of when you said yes

898
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:58,897
and turned my life upside down.

899
00:43:59,027 --> 00:44:00,115
For the better.

900
00:44:00,246 --> 00:44:01,246
I'm glad.

901
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:07,775
I got down on one knee
with a grass ring...

902
00:44:07,906 --> 00:44:08,689
Scott...

903
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,951
-and you said...

904
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,088
Pass the noodles?

905
00:44:20,962 --> 00:44:22,529
I love you, Natalie Rivers!

906
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,922
What are you doing?

907
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:26,315
I love you, Natalie Rivers.

908
00:44:26,446 --> 00:44:28,100
Scott, there are
the kids over there.

909
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,230
Now you say it.

910
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:30,406
You say it to me.

911
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:31,688
No, there's people
walking around.

912
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:33,801
I'll keep saying it.

913
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:35,673
I love you, Natalie...

914
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:36,803
Fine!

915
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:43,506
I love you, Scott Rivers.

916
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:45,508
Now I know that's not
how you feel about me.

917
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:48,337
I'm disappointing you.

918
00:44:48,468 --> 00:44:52,690
I love you, Scott Rivers!

919
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:55,605
See?

920
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:56,868
No, they agree.

921
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:03,048
This picnic's pretty perfect.

922
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:05,615
Thank you.

923
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:11,534
For you, anything.

924
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:21,936
Nervous?

925
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:23,982
No.

926
00:45:24,112 --> 00:45:28,813
I am/ I can't help thinking that

927
00:45:28,943 --> 00:45:30,249
maybe you were right all along.

928
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:31,487
He needs some guidance,
his testing anxiety's

929
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:32,642
isn't just gonna go away.

930
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:33,948
You were right, too.

931
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,099
I tried to encourage
him the other day

932
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:36,516
and he completely fall apart.

933
00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:37,909
It felt awful.

934
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:39,432
All I wanna do
what's best for them

935
00:45:39,562 --> 00:45:41,695
but it's so easy to... to
question every decision I

936
00:45:41,826 --> 00:45:43,479
make as a parent.

937
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,196
We're gonna make the
wrong choice sometimes

938
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,616
but that doesn't undermine
the things we get right.

939
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,227
You're a great dad.

940
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:54,186
Yeah, but you're like super mom.

941
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:55,467
I love watching
you with the kids.

942
00:45:55,491 --> 00:45:58,364
They just light up around you.

943
00:45:58,494 --> 00:45:59,574
We make a pretty good team.

944
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:03,456
Yeah.

945
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:04,586
Yeah.

946
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:07,939
Hi.

947
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:09,244
Hey.

948
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:10,815
Oh, I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

949
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:12,180
- Oh, it's OK.
- Don't worry about it.

950
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:13,248
Thank you.

951
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:14,206
One of my students
missed her bus.

952
00:46:14,336 --> 00:46:15,336
Oh, dear.

953
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:16,599
Oh, no, she's OK.

954
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,732
I'm so glad you could
come in together.

955
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:22,344
It's wonderful when we
can all work as a team.

956
00:46:22,475 --> 00:46:25,130
So, let's talk about Dylan.

957
00:46:28,263 --> 00:46:31,440
Well, we know Dylan
understands the materials.

958
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:34,139
So what do we do to
ease his anxiety?

959
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:35,357
Well we try to encourage him

960
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:36,881
but it doesn't help.

961
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:38,491
It just makes it worse.

962
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:42,277
I hate seeing him
struggle like this.

963
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:44,062
So what can we do differently?

964
00:46:44,192 --> 00:46:45,604
We could try moving
him to the front of the class.

965
00:46:45,628 --> 00:46:47,326
Sometimes that's helpful.

966
00:46:47,456 --> 00:46:49,652
That could really work and it
would eliminate distractions.

967
00:46:49,676 --> 00:46:51,654
And then, we could come up
with the game plan at home

968
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:53,201
for when he has his test.

969
00:46:53,332 --> 00:46:55,412
Something for him to turn
to when he begins to panic.

970
00:46:55,508 --> 00:46:56,988
Excellent.

971
00:46:57,118 --> 00:46:59,207
I'll send you some resources
and study techniques.

972
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:02,689
All Dylan needs to know is
that these tests are designed

973
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,735
to help him, not punish him.

974
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:06,649
OK?

975
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,739
OK, got it.

976
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,785
We got this.

977
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:13,134
I think you do.

978
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:21,447
You saved
that little girl's life.

979
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:22,697
But I don't know about that.

980
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:24,145
I'm serious.

981
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:25,819
I would have never
connected all those symptoms

982
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,802
to an allergic reaction,
but you were thinking fast.

983
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:30,108
It feels good to know that I

984
00:47:30,238 --> 00:47:32,545
can really help
people here, you know,

985
00:47:32,675 --> 00:47:34,112
in so many different ways.

986
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:36,202
Well, that is why you
started the practice, right?

987
00:47:36,288 --> 00:47:37,463
Yeah, I guess it must be.

988
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:39,421
Well done, Dr. Rivers.

989
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:41,554
You know, that little
girl reminded me of Emma.

990
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:43,358
I just looked at her and
all I could think about was

991
00:47:43,382 --> 00:47:44,862
how to make her feel better.

992
00:47:44,992 --> 00:47:46,992
It's because you're a
great doctor and a great mom.

993
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:57,351
All right.

994
00:47:57,396 --> 00:47:58,963
Crack 'em and throw 'em, guys.

995
00:47:59,093 --> 00:48:00,616
- See that go in.
- Flying everywhere.

996
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:01,530
Uh-huh.

997
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:02,749
Yeah.

998
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,316
Part of it.

999
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:06,404
Mommy!

1000
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:07,275
Hi, guys.

1001
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:08,189
Hey.

1002
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,364
There she is.

1003
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:13,760
Oh, I missed you so much today.

1004
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,109
Hi, bud.

1005
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,023
Hey.

1006
00:48:16,154 --> 00:48:17,285
Ooh, hello.

1007
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:18,460
Mm-mm.

1008
00:48:18,591 --> 00:48:19,374
How are you?

1009
00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:20,288
Great.

1010
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:21,202
Oh, great.

1011
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,116
Hi.

1012
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:24,336
Oh, hi.

1013
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:25,598
How was work today?

1014
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:26,860
- It was really good.
- Yeah?

1015
00:48:26,991 --> 00:48:27,730
Yeah.

1016
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:29,776
That's great.

1017
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,909
We wanna hear all about it.

1018
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:33,039
Yes.

1019
00:48:33,084 --> 00:48:35,260
We made dinner for you.

1020
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,609
You did?

1021
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:38,872
Spaghetti and mac and cheese.

1022
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:39,829
You did?

1023
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,222
Your favorite.

1024
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:42,571
Oh, wow.

1025
00:48:42,702 --> 00:48:45,009
I can't wait.

1026
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:48,055
Sure it'll tastes
as good as it looks.

1027
00:48:48,186 --> 00:48:49,056
Keep throwing them in there.

1028
00:48:49,187 --> 00:48:50,231
There you go.
- Yah!

1029
00:48:50,362 --> 00:48:51,232
Good job.

1030
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:53,147
Oh, wow, it's flying again.

1031
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:23,351
Computer, play something
soft and romantic.

1032
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:32,918
Although the clouds, they

1033
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:41,195
I see the moon shining bright.

1034
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:49,326
Maybe the sky

1035
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:59,822
La, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

1036
00:50:18,102 --> 00:50:20,930
Yeah, I got that one.

1037
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:23,846
Oh, sister, let's go down.

1038
00:50:23,977 --> 00:50:27,415
Let's go down, come on down.

1039
00:50:27,546 --> 00:50:30,505
Oh, sister, let's go down.

1040
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:23,384
All right.

1041
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:24,255
You guys ready?

1042
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:25,212
Yeah.

1043
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:27,823
There you go, Emma.

1044
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:29,390
Lunch for you.

1045
00:51:29,521 --> 00:51:31,175
Lunch for you.

1046
00:51:31,305 --> 00:51:33,177
Let's turn around, there you go.

1047
00:51:33,307 --> 00:51:34,307
And your flute.

1048
00:51:34,352 --> 00:51:35,744
Thank you.

1049
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,287
Now, tell Mommy what
you're going to do if you

1050
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:39,531
feel anxious in school today.

1051
00:51:39,661 --> 00:51:43,839
Problems and
eat them for breakfast.

1052
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:46,059
That's great, buddy.

1053
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,321
All right, let's go!

1054
00:51:50,368 --> 00:51:53,545
So you're liking what you see?

1055
00:51:53,675 --> 00:51:56,069
Well, I'm completely exhausted,

1056
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,352
and I'm a little weirded out
from eating mac and cheese

1057
00:51:58,376 --> 00:51:59,376
and spaghetti for dinner.

1058
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:02,225
But I guess that's what
I was supposed to see.

1059
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:03,792
And things with Scott
seemed really great.

1060
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:05,818
Oh, I'm so glad.

1061
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:10,779
But, I don't know, I'm worried
that the good moments are just

1062
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:11,650
moments.

1063
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,042
Oh, well.

1064
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:14,696
Be the same thing
with the bad moments.

1065
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:16,437
They're just moments.

1066
00:52:16,568 --> 00:52:17,395
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1067
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:18,787
Mm-hmm.

1068
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:20,659
So what now?

1069
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:23,096
Do... do I go back?

1070
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:27,187
Well, that is
really up to the veil.

1071
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:29,320
The veil seems to be
calling a lot of shots lately.

1072
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,234
Mm-hmm.

1073
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:31,364
Yeah.

1074
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,982
Abby, hey.

1075
00:52:40,113 --> 00:52:42,898
No, uh, I didn't forget.

1076
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:45,640
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1077
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:48,034
OK, great.

1078
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,427
See you soon.

1079
00:52:54,606 --> 00:52:57,957
I completely forgot to book
the hairdresser for her.

1080
00:52:58,087 --> 00:52:59,785
Oh, honey, don't fret.

1081
00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:01,526
I got a great girl.

1082
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:02,657
What else?

1083
00:53:02,788 --> 00:53:04,398
Everything.

1084
00:53:04,529 --> 00:53:06,376
I mean, I'm completely in over
my head with this wedding.

1085
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,010
Listen to me.

1086
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:11,623
You are always the one with the
master plan, and I know you.

1087
00:53:11,753 --> 00:53:14,103
And you in any
form, you can solve

1088
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:17,977
any problem with a spreadsheet
in a folder full of research.

1089
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:19,326
You're right.

1090
00:53:19,457 --> 00:53:20,608
I mean, future me can't
be that different.

1091
00:53:20,632 --> 00:53:21,372
That's right.

1092
00:53:21,502 --> 00:53:23,069
Exactly.

1093
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,637
Now, uh, I'll make a list of
birthdays and anniversaries

1094
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:27,484
and that's gonna help you
with the passwords, right?

1095
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:28,920
Yeah, and I'll dive
into the spreadsheet.

1096
00:53:28,944 --> 00:53:30,337
And I'll call the hairdresser.

1097
00:53:30,468 --> 00:53:31,923
Can you find out if
he could come over here?

1098
00:53:31,947 --> 00:53:33,035
Right.

1099
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:35,821
And you'll work on
everything else.

1100
00:53:35,951 --> 00:53:36,952
Work, I...

1101
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,127
I have to work today.

1102
00:53:38,258 --> 00:53:40,608
Mm-mm, you have the day off.

1103
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:43,089
I arranged it two weeks ago.

1104
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,656
Mimi, what would
I do without you?

1105
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:45,786
Oh-oh.

1106
00:53:56,015 --> 00:53:57,364
All right.

1107
00:53:57,495 --> 00:54:00,106
Natalie let's see if
you were the same person

1108
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,455
you always been.

1109
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:19,690
Come on!

1110
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:33,922
Oh, OK.

1111
00:54:34,053 --> 00:54:35,053
Abby's wedding.

1112
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:42,409
Well, Natalie, a 27-page
spreadsheet, that's, um...

1113
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,889
That's something.

1114
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:50,678
Wow, this woman can
run a family practice.

1115
00:54:55,944 --> 00:54:56,944
Coming.

1116
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:04,039
Ah, this is so much
better than having to drive

1117
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,911
across town of a salon.

1118
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:07,173
Thank you, Natalie.

1119
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:11,569
Oh, you know me,
always two steps ahead.

1120
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:12,961
What do you think?

1121
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:15,442
It's a simple updo
but is it too simple?

1122
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:17,488
Should have any
braids, or curls, or...

1123
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:18,880
No, it's beautiful.

1124
00:55:26,279 --> 00:55:27,019
What's wrong?

1125
00:55:27,149 --> 00:55:28,281
You look worried.

1126
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:29,412
I'm fine.

1127
00:55:33,678 --> 00:55:35,070
Wait, stop!

1128
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:37,246
Why are you gonna put
it on over her face

1129
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:39,379
just so you have to
pull it back again.

1130
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,033
Yeah, that's how it works.

1131
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,788
Well, it all works, right?

1132
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:57,918
Mm-hmm.

1133
00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:15,720
That was surprisingly intense.

1134
00:56:21,987 --> 00:56:24,946
You have made my
dream wedding come true.

1135
00:56:25,077 --> 00:56:26,818
Thank you for being here.

1136
00:56:26,948 --> 00:56:28,308
There's nowhere
else I'd rather be.

1137
00:56:32,824 --> 00:56:33,868
All right.

1138
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:34,999
Your turn.

1139
00:56:57,022 --> 00:56:58,806
Mm.

1140
00:56:58,937 --> 00:57:00,377
I didn't know I
could look like this.

1141
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:03,332
It reminds me of
your wedding day.

1142
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:06,597
I guess I never really saw
myself this way in the future...

1143
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:07,815
I mean, the past...

1144
00:57:07,946 --> 00:57:10,427
Ah, I don't know
what I'm saying.

1145
00:57:10,557 --> 00:57:13,081
You never saw
yourself what way, Natalie?

1146
00:57:13,212 --> 00:57:17,172
As an amazing, brilliant,
beautiful woman?

1147
00:57:17,303 --> 00:57:19,305
That's how I've always seen you.

1148
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,439
That's how everyone sees you.

1149
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:26,312
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1150
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,402
Do you see this woman?

1151
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:32,100
I mean, really see her?

1152
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:33,431
Have you ever really seen her?

1153
00:57:39,717 --> 00:57:41,501
Oh.

1154
00:57:41,632 --> 00:57:43,764
According to my
27-page wedding plan,

1155
00:57:43,895 --> 00:57:45,679
you have to pick up
your marriage license.

1156
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:48,334
Mm, I'm on it.

1157
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,118
And I'm gonna take
the kids to the park.

1158
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:51,511
Oh, well, have fun.

1159
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:52,642
I will see you later.

1160
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:02,173
You good?

1161
00:58:02,217 --> 00:58:04,437
This is the best day ever.

1162
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:08,136
Even though the man, he
likes all that mushy stuff.

1163
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:10,443
What I do know is when
we were in medical school,

1164
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:12,445
he would stay up
really late studying

1165
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:15,404
because he worked during the
day at the campus bookstore.

1166
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:17,276
He saved up enough
money for three months

1167
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:20,018
to take me to the mountains
during winter break.

1168
00:58:20,148 --> 00:58:21,976
I had never seen snow before.

1169
00:58:22,107 --> 00:58:22,934
No way!

1170
00:58:23,064 --> 00:58:24,501
I love snow.

1171
00:58:24,631 --> 00:58:26,503
Yeah, never in my whole life.

1172
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:29,070
We were going to a
lecture, he said.

1173
00:58:29,201 --> 00:58:31,420
But when we landed, we
were in the mountains

1174
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,074
and it was snowing.

1175
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:34,565
We played in it
the entire weekend.

1176
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:36,774
That's so Dad.

1177
00:58:36,904 --> 00:58:40,038
He really has always been
thoughtful and very good

1178
00:58:40,168 --> 00:58:41,822
at surprises.

1179
00:58:41,953 --> 00:58:44,018
Yeah, when he... like, when
he surprises us by picking us

1180
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:47,088
up early at school
and we skip classes

1181
00:58:47,219 --> 00:58:50,265
just to go on an adventure.

1182
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:51,397
He does that?

1183
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,528
No.

1184
00:58:55,009 --> 00:58:56,794
Well, to me it sounds
like a really good dad.

1185
00:58:56,924 --> 00:58:57,924
Yeah.

1186
00:58:58,012 --> 00:58:59,274
I mean, he is a really good dad.

1187
00:58:59,405 --> 00:59:03,061
He the keeper, that's
what you always say.

1188
00:59:03,191 --> 00:59:04,191
Need some more?

1189
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:05,716
You're so silly, Mommy.

1190
00:59:08,675 --> 00:59:10,808
I wish we could come
here tomorrow so I

1191
00:59:10,938 --> 00:59:13,332
don't have to take that test.

1192
00:59:13,462 --> 00:59:15,116
You're gonna do great, buddy.

1193
00:59:15,247 --> 00:59:16,746
When we get home, I'll show you
some of my marking strategies

1194
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,467
that helped me when
I had my test, OK?

1195
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:19,598
OK.

1196
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:21,340
They're so pretty.

1197
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:24,604
I love the ducks.

1198
00:59:24,735 --> 00:59:25,997
Wanna go to the playground?

1199
00:59:26,127 --> 00:59:27,127
Yay!

1200
00:59:47,322 --> 00:59:48,628
Hey, dad.

1201
00:59:48,759 --> 00:59:49,977
Hey, honey, where are you?

1202
00:59:50,108 --> 00:59:51,283
I've decided to keep

1203
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:52,806
the kids for the evening.

1204
00:59:52,937 --> 00:59:54,523
It's been so nice to
have some time with them.

1205
00:59:54,547 --> 00:59:56,027
What about dinner?

1206
00:59:56,157 --> 00:59:57,898
Oh, shoot, it's Tuesday.

1207
00:59:58,029 --> 00:59:59,900
Dinner with Scott.

1208
01:00:00,031 --> 01:00:01,467
It's not just Tuesday.

1209
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,773
It's Abby and Brian...

1210
01:00:02,903 --> 01:00:04,165
-your double date.

1211
01:00:04,296 --> 01:00:07,081
You've been excited
about this for weeks.

1212
01:00:07,212 --> 01:00:08,517
But it wasn't in my spreadsheet.

1213
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:09,997
You forget?

1214
01:00:10,128 --> 01:00:11,433
No, of course not.
Um...

1215
01:00:11,564 --> 01:00:12,739
where is it again?

1216
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:15,307
Same place in town
you always go to.

1217
01:00:15,437 --> 01:00:16,743
Right.

1218
01:00:16,874 --> 01:00:18,329
OK, I'm gonna drop the
kids off right now.

1219
01:00:18,353 --> 01:00:19,050
OK.

1220
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,225
See you soon.

1221
01:00:20,355 --> 01:00:21,355
Bye.

1222
01:00:25,056 --> 01:00:27,145
OK, kids, it's time to
go to mom and dad... uh,

1223
01:00:27,275 --> 01:00:29,582
I mean grandma and grandpa's.

1224
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:31,584
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

1225
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,720
Yay!

1226
01:00:37,764 --> 01:00:40,027
Ready for some fun?

1227
01:00:40,158 --> 01:00:41,507
Have a great time.

1228
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,856
Do you have any address?

1229
01:00:42,987 --> 01:00:44,292
No.

1230
01:00:44,423 --> 01:00:47,556
I remember that it's
on Main and Atlantic.

1231
01:00:47,687 --> 01:00:48,882
You should know
how to get there.

1232
01:00:48,906 --> 01:00:50,298
I'm fine.

1233
01:00:50,429 --> 01:00:51,754
I'm just a little frantic
cause I'm running late.

1234
01:00:51,778 --> 01:00:52,799
Um, I will pick them
up when we're done.

1235
01:00:52,823 --> 01:00:53,998
OK.
All right.

1236
01:00:54,128 --> 01:00:55,564
Drive Safe.
- I will.

1237
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:56,914
Bye.

1238
01:01:11,276 --> 01:01:12,538
Scott.

1239
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,820
I can't believe I
found this place.

1240
01:01:13,844 --> 01:01:15,062
Sorry, I'm late.
I called.

1241
01:01:15,193 --> 01:01:17,195
No, there's no
reception in there.

1242
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:18,196
I forgot.

1243
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:20,633
It wasn't in my spreadsheet.

1244
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:21,852
What are you talking about?

1245
01:01:21,982 --> 01:01:23,342
We've been planning
this for weeks.

1246
01:01:25,725 --> 01:01:26,595
I'm calling Dr. Hammond.

1247
01:01:26,726 --> 01:01:27,726
Something's off.

1248
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:28,859
You don't call Dr. Hammond.

1249
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,034
I'm fine.

1250
01:01:30,164 --> 01:01:31,402
I'm just juggling
a lot right now.

1251
01:01:31,426 --> 01:01:32,645
You're not fine, Natalie.

1252
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:35,300
I'm worried.

1253
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,302
Hey, give me a break.

1254
01:01:37,432 --> 01:01:38,695
I'm trying really hard here.

1255
01:01:38,825 --> 01:01:40,609
Why don't we just go home?

1256
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,620
Come back some other time
when you're up for it.

1257
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:46,180
I'm up for it now.

1258
01:01:46,311 --> 01:01:48,008
You've been so stubborn.

1259
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:49,618
I'm not being stubborn, Scott.

1260
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:51,925
Just trying to keep my promises.

1261
01:01:52,056 --> 01:01:53,361
Sorry I'm not perfect.

1262
01:01:53,492 --> 01:01:55,842
No one expects
you to be perfect.

1263
01:01:55,973 --> 01:01:57,515
Honey, you put this
pressure on yourself.

1264
01:01:57,539 --> 01:01:58,539
Nobody else does.

1265
01:02:05,634 --> 01:02:08,855
What you said the
other day, about this

1266
01:02:08,986 --> 01:02:10,770
not being your life...

1267
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:12,206
It's really not the time.

1268
01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:14,137
Look, I understand the
need for soul searching

1269
01:02:14,165 --> 01:02:15,969
and questioning whether or
not you're on the right path,

1270
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:16,993
but I have to know.

1271
01:02:21,563 --> 01:02:22,956
Are you unhappy
with our marriage?

1272
01:02:27,308 --> 01:02:28,388
Abby and Brian are waiting.

1273
01:02:28,483 --> 01:02:29,571
Let's just go inside.

1274
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,660
Come on.

1275
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:45,413
You don't usually

1276
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:46,719
mind when I order for you.

1277
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,416
Just because I
order something once

1278
01:02:48,547 --> 01:02:50,307
doesn't necessarily mean that
I want it that way forever.

1279
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:52,594
But you always order
the same thing, so...

1280
01:02:52,725 --> 01:02:55,119
You could have checked
with me, that's all.

1281
01:02:55,249 --> 01:02:56,860
Would you like the same tiramisu

1282
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:58,794
you always get or would you
like something different, honey?

1283
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:00,254
Uh, no dessert
for me, thank you.

1284
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:01,212
OK.

1285
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:03,823
Tiramisu, two spoons.

1286
01:03:03,954 --> 01:03:05,172
Yeah.

1287
01:03:05,303 --> 01:03:08,480
So, um, I suppose
we should tell you

1288
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:11,135
why we wanted to get dinner.

1289
01:03:11,265 --> 01:03:13,528
We wanted to get your advice
on writing our own vows.

1290
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:16,096
Oh.

1291
01:03:16,227 --> 01:03:17,924
It's probably not the best time.

1292
01:03:18,055 --> 01:03:20,840
Well, wedding's Saturday
so not many nights left.

1293
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:39,206
Everything I write
is just so trite,

1294
01:03:39,337 --> 01:03:41,861
and the vows at your
wedding were so beautiful.

1295
01:03:41,992 --> 01:03:46,474
Don't you have any
tips you can share?

1296
01:03:46,605 --> 01:03:50,174
Maybe, think of the first
time you fell in love.

1297
01:03:50,304 --> 01:03:51,871
Vows will come.

1298
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:52,785
That's good.

1299
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,700
Yeah.

1300
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,224
What else?

1301
01:03:57,355 --> 01:03:58,462
We need to find something that's

1302
01:03:58,486 --> 01:04:00,749
personal for the two of you.

1303
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,969
Of course, there are
relationships and people

1304
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:08,061
that you look up to, but what is
it that you find in yourselves

1305
01:04:08,192 --> 01:04:09,541
makes you two so good together?

1306
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:15,024
Don't deny yourself.

1307
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:22,771
I want us
to know each other like that.

1308
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:25,818
And I think one of the
reasons we're so good

1309
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:28,647
together is that
we're so curious

1310
01:04:28,777 --> 01:04:35,306
and endlessly fascinated
with life and each other.

1311
01:04:35,436 --> 01:04:37,036
It sounds like
you're well on your way to

1312
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:40,528
writing some pretty
beautiful vows.

1313
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:41,659
And a happy marriage.

1314
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,814
What are you guys watching?

1315
01:05:05,945 --> 01:05:07,425
Our wedding video.

1316
01:05:07,555 --> 01:05:08,715
Emma thought it would be fun.

1317
01:05:12,517 --> 01:05:15,476
What's wrong with the sound?

1318
01:05:15,607 --> 01:05:18,610
Your cousin had it muted
till we started our vows.

1319
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:19,740
Oh.

1320
01:05:23,571 --> 01:05:24,833
This is my favorite part.

1321
01:05:29,273 --> 01:05:32,232
It was the first time you've
watched it without cringing.

1322
01:05:32,363 --> 01:05:33,930
It's cute.

1323
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,410
Oh, it's a good thing you
weren't aware of it that day.

1324
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:37,846
Oh, you look nervous.

1325
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:39,936
I was afraid
if something went wrong,

1326
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:42,416
you wouldn't wanna marry me.

1327
01:05:42,547 --> 01:05:45,158
Oh, guess I hadn't yet figured
out what I would be missing.

1328
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,690
Hey, buddy.

1329
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:14,333
I'm sorry I've been
messing up so much lately.

1330
01:06:17,147 --> 01:06:18,667
I'm sorry I put so
much pressure on you

1331
01:06:18,757 --> 01:06:21,716
when you're already stressed.

1332
01:06:21,847 --> 01:06:25,372
Sometimes I just get
wrapped up in my own world.

1333
01:06:25,503 --> 01:06:28,854
We both do.

1334
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,204
- I
- promise to never let fear get

1335
01:06:31,335 --> 01:06:32,640
in the way of my love for you.

1336
01:06:36,557 --> 01:06:37,906
Have I kept that vow?

1337
01:06:40,735 --> 01:06:44,783
Oh, I mean, there
was that one time.

1338
01:06:44,913 --> 01:06:45,913
Of course.

1339
01:06:48,482 --> 01:06:52,704
Love and fear have battled it
out a little but in the end,

1340
01:06:52,834 --> 01:06:55,924
love always wins.

1341
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:57,404
We wouldn't be
here if it hadn't.

1342
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,889
I'm glad I'm here.

1343
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,021
I love our life.

1344
01:07:07,762 --> 01:07:10,591
I love you.

1345
01:07:10,722 --> 01:07:11,984
I love you, too.

1346
01:07:17,337 --> 01:07:18,599
Hey.

1347
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:19,730
Hey.

1348
01:07:19,774 --> 01:07:20,774
It's fine.

1349
01:07:23,648 --> 01:07:26,042
I have a feeling I'll be back
to my normal self very soon.

1350
01:07:30,655 --> 01:07:31,655
OK.

1351
01:07:34,963 --> 01:07:38,010
I just don't wanna forget what
a moment like this feels like.

1352
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,536
Maybe I can help with that.

1353
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:07,300
Let's see how it ends.

1354
01:08:07,431 --> 01:08:10,825
I promise
that in the busyness and routine

1355
01:08:10,956 --> 01:08:14,655
of everyday life, I will
find the moments to remind

1356
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:16,831
you how special you are to me.

1357
01:08:25,057 --> 01:08:26,057
Natalie?

1358
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,324
The wedding's off.

1359
01:08:31,455 --> 01:08:32,455
What?

1360
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:37,809
Sweetie, you're just scared.

1361
01:08:37,939 --> 01:08:39,898
I'm sure if you think
about it hard enough,

1362
01:08:40,028 --> 01:08:41,745
you can find reasons that
you still wanna marry Brian.

1363
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:42,596
What?

1364
01:08:42,727 --> 01:08:43,510
Now, this isn't nerves.

1365
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:44,681
I still wanna marry Brian.

1366
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:46,165
There was a flood.

1367
01:08:46,296 --> 01:08:47,514
What?

1368
01:08:47,645 --> 01:08:48,515
Yeah, there
was a pipe that burst

1369
01:08:48,646 --> 01:08:49,951
and there's water everywhere.

1370
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:51,910
The place is all wet,
three inches of water.

1371
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,868
I'd... the wedding's off.

1372
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:54,782
No.

1373
01:08:54,913 --> 01:08:56,132
There are other places.

1374
01:08:56,262 --> 01:08:57,263
No, we've already looked.

1375
01:08:57,394 --> 01:08:58,395
They're booked.

1376
01:08:58,525 --> 01:08:59,787
No.

1377
01:08:59,918 --> 01:09:01,659
Uh, churches, uh,
reception halls, hotel

1378
01:09:01,789 --> 01:09:03,051
conference rooms, lobbies.

1379
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:04,618
I mean, come on!

1380
01:09:04,749 --> 01:09:06,751
Weddings, company parties,
school dances, they're

1381
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:07,881
all booked.

1382
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:14,933
We could have it at Louie's.

1383
01:09:15,063 --> 01:09:19,546
I mean, he loves us
and the food's amazing.

1384
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:21,200
Brian and I love that restaurant

1385
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:23,637
but does he even
take reservations?

1386
01:09:23,768 --> 01:09:25,204
I can call him.

1387
01:09:25,335 --> 01:09:27,946
I mean, his family
are friends of mine.

1388
01:09:28,076 --> 01:09:29,252
I think he might do it.

1389
01:09:29,382 --> 01:09:30,905
We would scale down
a little bit but...

1390
01:09:31,036 --> 01:09:33,169
Mm, a lot.

1391
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:34,953
It could work.

1392
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,215
- OK.
- Yeah?

1393
01:09:36,346 --> 01:09:37,129
Yeah.

1394
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,261
OK, let's do it.
- OK.

1395
01:09:38,391 --> 01:09:39,175
OK.

1396
01:09:39,305 --> 01:09:40,305
Do it.

1397
01:09:44,136 --> 01:09:45,287
I'm getting married
in three days!

1398
01:09:45,311 --> 01:09:46,311
Yes!

1399
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:50,273
Oh.

1400
01:09:50,403 --> 01:09:51,403
OK, I gotta go.

1401
01:09:51,448 --> 01:09:52,492
Go.

1402
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:54,277
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1403
01:09:54,407 --> 01:09:55,539
Hey, guys.

1404
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:56,669
Hey.

1405
01:09:56,757 --> 01:09:58,324
Mommy, Mommy, guess what?

1406
01:09:58,455 --> 01:09:59,238
What?

1407
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:00,108
Show her, buddy.

1408
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,328
Dylan!

1409
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:03,242
Good job.

1410
01:10:03,373 --> 01:10:05,331
I'm so proud of you.

1411
01:10:05,462 --> 01:10:06,289
Here.

1412
01:10:06,419 --> 01:10:07,638
Me, too, Dylan.

1413
01:10:11,555 --> 01:10:13,470
The stuff you told
me really helps.

1414
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,428
So this calls for celebration.

1415
01:10:15,559 --> 01:10:17,300
You know what that means?

1416
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:18,475
Breakfast for dinner!

1417
01:10:18,605 --> 01:10:20,085
Yay!

1418
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:20,999
Pancakes!

1419
01:10:21,129 --> 01:10:21,869
Yay!

1420
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,828
Chocolate chips!

1421
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,871
This dress is so beautiful.

1422
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:08,307
Oh, don't make me cry.

1423
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:09,787
Linda just did my makeup.

1424
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:10,701
No.

1425
01:11:10,831 --> 01:11:12,050
Girls, girls, girls.

1426
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,834
No crying yet, please.

1427
01:11:13,965 --> 01:11:14,748
Hmm.

1428
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:16,620
Oh.

1429
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:18,491
Hey, it's almost time.

1430
01:11:18,622 --> 01:11:20,295
Finally, I feel like
I've been waiting forever.

1431
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,146
Mm-hmm.

1432
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,495
Any last minute nerves?

1433
01:11:22,626 --> 01:11:23,757
No.

1434
01:11:23,888 --> 01:11:25,585
Hmm.

1435
01:11:25,716 --> 01:11:27,084
You don't think Brian's having
any last minute nerves, do you?

1436
01:11:27,108 --> 01:11:28,284
I'm sure he's fine, honey.

1437
01:11:28,414 --> 01:11:29,154
Can you go check?

1438
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,068
Mm-hmm.

1439
01:11:30,198 --> 01:11:31,330
I'll go.

1440
01:11:31,461 --> 01:11:32,461
You'll be fine.

1441
01:11:32,549 --> 01:11:33,811
And I have to get dressed.

1442
01:11:45,692 --> 01:11:47,085
Wow.

1443
01:11:47,215 --> 01:11:48,652
I could say the same about you.

1444
01:11:51,959 --> 01:11:53,265
You look beautiful.

1445
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:54,396
Thank you.

1446
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:08,628
Can I ask you a question?

1447
01:12:08,759 --> 01:12:11,457
How did you know it
could be like this?

1448
01:12:11,588 --> 01:12:13,154
In all those years
ago when we were

1449
01:12:13,285 --> 01:12:15,940
just two kids in medical school,
how did you know that it...

1450
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:23,077
That we could be this way?

1451
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:24,557
I didn't know.

1452
01:12:24,688 --> 01:12:27,517
I just hoped.

1453
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:30,087
But I knew there wasn't anyone
else who wanted to try it with.

1454
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:38,397
I hope I didn't screw this up.

1455
01:12:38,528 --> 01:12:41,269
How could you say that?

1456
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,402
The way it looks perfect,
you did an amazing job.

1457
01:12:47,275 --> 01:12:48,275
Come here.

1458
01:12:51,062 --> 01:12:52,629
Welcome to Aunt Abby's wedding.

1459
01:12:55,762 --> 01:13:00,811
Natalie, I think
it might be time.

1460
01:13:00,941 --> 01:13:02,334
But I don't wanna go.

1461
01:13:02,465 --> 01:13:05,990
I know but you'll be back
sooner than you realize.

1462
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,426
I'm not so sure.

1463
01:13:07,557 --> 01:13:09,776
These things aren't really bad.

1464
01:13:09,907 --> 01:13:12,649
What if I lose all of this
before I even have it?

1465
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:15,826
Honey, Scott loves
you and you love him.

1466
01:13:15,956 --> 01:13:17,131
It'll be OK.

1467
01:13:17,262 --> 01:13:18,568
Now, listen to me.

1468
01:13:18,698 --> 01:13:20,700
This is very important.

1469
01:13:20,831 --> 01:13:25,923
When the reveal is over, your
question if it was even real,

1470
01:13:26,053 --> 01:13:28,665
your mind will tell you
that was all a dream,

1471
01:13:28,795 --> 01:13:30,928
but your heart will
know the truth.

1472
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:35,541
So please, honey,
trust your heart.

1473
01:13:35,672 --> 01:13:36,760
OK?

1474
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:38,675
Thank you, Mimi.

1475
01:13:38,805 --> 01:13:40,024
Ow.

1476
01:13:40,154 --> 01:13:42,809
I love you.

1477
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:44,376
Welcome to Aunt Abby's wedding.

1478
01:15:47,194 --> 01:15:48,935
Mimi?

1479
01:15:49,066 --> 01:15:50,458
What?

1480
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:51,764
Did that really happen?

1481
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:54,114
Did what happen?

1482
01:15:54,245 --> 01:15:55,420
I... I saw...

1483
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:59,337
I saw him... uh,
Scott, and I had kids.

1484
01:15:59,467 --> 01:16:01,034
And Abby was getting...

1485
01:16:01,165 --> 01:16:04,951
I told you, there's just
something about this old veil.

1486
01:16:05,082 --> 01:16:11,654
It makes... it helps you
imagine things that could be.

1487
01:16:11,784 --> 01:16:15,353
But I didn't imagine it, did I?

1488
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:16,267
I... I don't know.

1489
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:17,616
How do you feel?

1490
01:16:17,747 --> 01:16:20,401
Did... did it help
you decide anything?

1491
01:16:20,532 --> 01:16:22,926
I saw my life, and
I've never been more sure

1492
01:16:23,056 --> 01:16:25,145
of anything in my entire life.

1493
01:16:25,276 --> 01:16:26,146
I have to talk to Scott.

1494
01:16:26,277 --> 01:16:28,758
I have to get to the airport.

1495
01:16:28,888 --> 01:16:32,196
Ugh, I'm never gonna get there
with traffic and parking.

1496
01:16:32,326 --> 01:16:34,981
Honey, Abby is
coming over so she

1497
01:16:35,112 --> 01:16:36,722
can take you to the airport.

1498
01:16:36,853 --> 01:16:38,028
- OK, great!
- OK!

1499
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:38,942
OK.

1500
01:16:39,072 --> 01:16:39,812
Hey, hey, hey.

1501
01:16:39,943 --> 01:16:41,640
Oh.

1502
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:43,163
All right, take a deep breath.

1503
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:52,650
Oh, Abby, thank God.

1504
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:54,174
Hey.

1505
01:16:54,305 --> 01:16:55,630
I am so sorry that I
have not been there for you

1506
01:16:55,654 --> 01:16:56,524
like I should be.

1507
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:58,178
What are you talking about?

1508
01:16:58,309 --> 01:17:01,007
I have done a terrible job
at being your big sister.

1509
01:17:01,138 --> 01:17:02,792
Oh, no, you haven't.

1510
01:17:02,922 --> 01:17:04,054
Yes, I have.

1511
01:17:04,184 --> 01:17:05,708
OK, but you're
perfect the way you are.

1512
01:17:05,838 --> 01:17:07,405
I don't wanna be perfect.

1513
01:17:07,535 --> 01:17:09,886
I just wanna enjoy every moment
of this incredible journey

1514
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:11,148
and my beautiful family.

1515
01:17:12,453 --> 01:17:13,605
Can you take me to the airport?

1516
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:14,412
Sure.

1517
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:15,326
Is everything OK?

1518
01:17:15,456 --> 01:17:16,719
Yeah.

1519
01:17:16,849 --> 01:17:17,870
I just have to find Scott.
Thank you, Mimi.

1520
01:17:17,894 --> 01:17:18,634
Mwah.

1521
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:19,809
Oh, and drive careful.

1522
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:21,854
I'll tell you later.

1523
01:17:21,985 --> 01:17:23,266
- Oh, what's going on with...
- All right.

1524
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:24,290
- Scott?
- Um...

1525
01:17:24,378 --> 01:17:24,770
Good...
it's kinda...

1526
01:17:24,901 --> 01:17:25,641
-luck!

1527
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:27,338
Of a story.

1528
01:17:27,468 --> 01:17:29,253
Ay-ya-yay.

1529
01:17:35,215 --> 01:17:37,150
And then I'm freaking out
because it's the first time

1530
01:17:37,174 --> 01:17:39,611
in my life that I don't
have a plan to guide me,

1531
01:17:39,742 --> 01:17:40,830
and then he proposes.

1532
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,744
Proposes?

1533
01:17:41,874 --> 01:17:43,528
Yeah, but I said no.

1534
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:44,921
You said no?

1535
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:47,750
Well, I was caught
off guard and terrified,

1536
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,927
and completely unsure
of what I wanted.

1537
01:17:51,057 --> 01:17:52,668
But now you're sure?

1538
01:17:52,798 --> 01:17:54,757
What changed your mind?

1539
01:17:54,887 --> 01:17:57,368
I got the clarity I needed.

1540
01:17:57,498 --> 01:17:59,196
But it doesn't matter now.

1541
01:17:59,326 --> 01:18:02,547
He's going to Chicago and
it may be over for good

1542
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,288
and I thought that
I could fix it,

1543
01:18:04,418 --> 01:18:07,726
but we'll never even get there
in time with all this traffic.

1544
01:18:07,857 --> 01:18:09,206
They're redirecting traffic.

1545
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:13,882
It doesn't matter,
his plane's taking off

1546
01:18:13,906 --> 01:18:15,342
for like five minutes anyway.

1547
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:21,000
Can you just... can
you just turn up here?

1548
01:18:21,131 --> 01:18:22,131
Yeah.

1549
01:19:06,176 --> 01:19:07,176
Scott?

1550
01:19:09,657 --> 01:19:11,703
Natalie.

1551
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:13,313
What are you doing here?

1552
01:19:13,444 --> 01:19:14,924
I'm just gonna ask
you the same thing.

1553
01:19:18,362 --> 01:19:20,233
I missed my flight.

1554
01:19:20,364 --> 01:19:22,409
You know me, always late.

1555
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,100
It's one of the
things I love about you.

1556
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:32,768
I booked another one,
for tomorrow, same time.

1557
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:35,466
So you're still going?

1558
01:19:35,596 --> 01:19:37,598
Yeah, I'm still going.

1559
01:19:37,729 --> 01:19:40,776
Is that what you want?

1560
01:19:40,906 --> 01:19:42,038
It's for the best, I think.

1561
01:19:42,168 --> 01:19:43,343
I just...

1562
01:19:43,474 --> 01:19:45,084
I don't want you
to go to Chicago.

1563
01:19:45,215 --> 01:19:47,913
Natalie, please don't make
this harder than it already is.

1564
01:19:48,044 --> 01:19:51,003
OK, I'm sorry I hurt you.

1565
01:19:51,134 --> 01:19:52,134
You were right.

1566
01:19:52,178 --> 01:19:53,397
We're better off.

1567
01:19:53,527 --> 01:19:56,139
Is that how you really feel?

1568
01:19:56,269 --> 01:19:57,140
I made a mistake.

1569
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:58,097
Natalie, I get it.

1570
01:19:58,228 --> 01:19:59,490
I'm just not the one...

1571
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:02,449
No, just... will you
just listen to me?

1572
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,060
I love you.

1573
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:06,105
I was just
overwhelmed and scared

1574
01:20:06,236 --> 01:20:09,065
and I wasn't thinking clearly.

1575
01:20:09,195 --> 01:20:13,112
But I am now and I've seen
my life and you're in it.

1576
01:20:13,243 --> 01:20:20,250
I want you today,
tomorrow, forever.

1577
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:24,254
And if you'll have it, I want
us to have a life together.

1578
01:20:24,384 --> 01:20:25,951
There's gonna be a
beautiful little girl

1579
01:20:26,082 --> 01:20:28,103
named Emma who thinks that
her father hung the moon and...

1580
01:20:28,127 --> 01:20:29,520
What are you talking about?

1581
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:31,522
- A little boy named
Dylan who looks up to you

1582
01:20:31,652 --> 01:20:33,350
like you wouldn't believe.

1583
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,569
And we're gonna have
breakfast for dinner

1584
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,007
and adopt a family of
ducks from this very pond.

1585
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:40,487
And every night when we do
the dishes, we're gonna dance

1586
01:20:40,618 --> 01:20:46,102
and it's gonna be beautiful,
and chaotic, and crazy,

1587
01:20:46,232 --> 01:20:48,756
but that's life.

1588
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:52,673
And I want it to be our
life more than anything.

1589
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:59,724
I want you and I
want us, and I want

1590
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:02,074
it to start today, right here.

1591
01:21:06,209 --> 01:21:09,081
I just don't know how we
can go from this to that.

1592
01:21:09,212 --> 01:21:10,735
I do.

1593
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,868
I make a promise to
never let fear get

1594
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:16,001
in the way of my love for you.

1595
01:21:16,132 --> 01:21:20,005
And I know I'm gonna get
scared sometimes, so are you,

1596
01:21:20,136 --> 01:21:26,098
but it doesn't matter
because when I close my eyes,

1597
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:28,057
I can't picture my
life without you.

1598
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:40,504
I just wanted you
to know how I felt.

1599
01:21:40,634 --> 01:21:42,332
Natalie, wait.

1600
01:22:15,843 --> 01:22:17,845
I love you.

1601
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:18,976
I love you, too.

1602
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:28,769
Let's make it happen.

1603
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:29,640
Now.

1604
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:31,468
Yeah.

1605
01:22:31,598 --> 01:22:32,469
And is this your life?

1606
01:22:32,599 --> 01:22:36,516
I hope so.

1607
01:22:36,647 --> 01:22:37,474
Let's go.
- OK.

1608
01:22:37,604 --> 01:22:38,604
Come on.

1609
01:22:48,572 --> 01:22:49,572
Hmm.

1610
01:22:49,616 --> 01:22:51,270
Still into pastels, I see.

1611
01:22:51,401 --> 01:22:53,577
What do you think
of an outdoor wedding.

1612
01:22:53,707 --> 01:22:54,447
You know, a garden theme?

1613
01:22:54,578 --> 01:22:55,883
That's a great idea.

1614
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:57,296
We could have it
in the park by the pond.

1615
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,538
Oh, that would be stunning.

1616
01:22:58,669 --> 01:23:00,366
There go my final
residency applications.

1617
01:23:00,497 --> 01:23:03,065
Oh, yes.

1618
01:23:03,195 --> 01:23:04,892
Now, we wait.

1619
01:23:05,023 --> 01:23:06,131
Where do you hope you'll land?

1620
01:23:06,155 --> 01:23:07,373
It doesn't matter.

1621
01:23:07,504 --> 01:23:09,810
I just wanna help
people and be with you.

1622
01:23:09,941 --> 01:23:11,571
I don't know, I have a
feeling I might want to have

1623
01:23:11,595 --> 01:23:12,595
my own practice one day.

1624
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:13,466
Really?

1625
01:23:13,597 --> 01:23:15,120
That's my girl.

1626
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:17,079
I think I'll be good at it.

1627
01:23:17,209 --> 01:23:18,209
I have no doubt.

1628
01:23:30,353 --> 01:23:32,572
Everyone, everyone.

1629
01:23:32,703 --> 01:23:38,491
I'd like to propose a toast to
my first born and to my first

1630
01:23:38,622 --> 01:23:41,016
son-in-law-to-be.

1631
01:23:41,146 --> 01:23:46,151
May you have what
Janine and I have.

1632
01:23:46,282 --> 01:23:49,241
I love you both.

1633
01:23:49,372 --> 01:23:50,155
Cheers!

1634
01:23:50,286 --> 01:23:51,069
Cheers!

1635
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,200
Dad, I love you.

1636
01:23:57,815 --> 01:23:59,425
Whew!

1637
01:23:59,556 --> 01:24:00,296
I wanna go.

1638
01:24:00,426 --> 01:24:01,426
Yeah.

1639
01:24:06,998 --> 01:24:07,868
Everything OK?

1640
01:24:07,999 --> 01:24:08,782
Oh, it's great.

1641
01:24:08,913 --> 01:24:09,913
OK.

1642
01:24:09,957 --> 01:24:11,698
Um, you should go talk to her.

1643
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:12,569
What... oh, no.

1644
01:24:12,699 --> 01:24:13,874
I... I wasn't, uh...

1645
01:24:14,005 --> 01:24:15,050
I didn't...

1646
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,182
Oh, she's... she's
smart, and kind,

1647
01:24:17,313 --> 01:24:19,706
and she wants to be a doctor,
and she has a strange affinity

1648
01:24:19,837 --> 01:24:21,360
for knock, knock jokes.

1649
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:24,276
Well, I don't wanna bother her.

1650
01:24:24,407 --> 01:24:25,407
I don't think she'd mind.

1651
01:24:28,933 --> 01:24:30,848
Hi.

1652
01:24:30,978 --> 01:24:33,242
I think you should
go talk to him.

1653
01:24:33,372 --> 01:24:34,504
Are you crazy?

1654
01:24:34,634 --> 01:24:35,896
Hmm.

1655
01:24:36,027 --> 01:24:37,811
He might very well
be the one, you know.

1656
01:24:37,942 --> 01:24:39,465
I don't think so.

1657
01:24:39,596 --> 01:24:41,815
Mm, hey, he's very nice.

1658
01:24:41,946 --> 01:24:45,167
Kind, smart, loves
baseball, and cooking.

1659
01:24:45,297 --> 01:24:46,951
And mom and dad would love him.

1660
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,518
OK, how do you know all of this?

1661
01:24:48,648 --> 01:24:50,346
I met him once since
a long time from now.

1662
01:24:53,566 --> 01:24:54,872
Go talk to him.

1663
01:24:58,832 --> 01:24:59,832
Oh, hi.

1664
01:25:02,749 --> 01:25:04,186
Ooh, I don't know.

1665
01:25:04,316 --> 01:25:05,316
I just have a feeling.

1666
01:25:14,544 --> 01:25:17,286
Everyone, thank you so
much for being here to help

1667
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:21,290
celebrate our engagement.

1668
01:25:25,294 --> 01:25:27,339
We are so happy to
share this moment

1669
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:29,907
with our friends and family.

1670
01:25:30,037 --> 01:25:32,953
I am honestly the
luckiest guy alive.

1671
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:37,958
I am able to share the rest of
my life with the perfect woman

1672
01:25:38,089 --> 01:25:40,439
and celebrate with
this amazing family.

1673
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:43,268
So have a great time, don't
do anything I wouldn't

1674
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:46,315
do, and again, thank you all.

1675
01:25:46,445 --> 01:25:47,229
Cheers!

1676
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:48,186
Cheers.

1677
01:25:48,317 --> 01:25:49,666
Thanks for coming.

1678
01:25:49,796 --> 01:25:50,667
Hey, I didn't get any.

1679
01:25:50,797 --> 01:25:51,797
Oh, I'm sorry!

1680
01:25:55,846 --> 01:25:57,500
Mm.

1681
01:25:57,630 --> 01:25:58,630
I love this place.

1682
01:25:58,675 --> 01:25:59,869
We should come here more often.

1683
01:25:59,893 --> 01:26:01,044
- I have a feeling we will.
- Yeah?

1684
01:26:01,068 --> 01:26:01,852
Mm-hmm.

1685
01:26:01,982 --> 01:26:02,722
Mm.

1686
01:26:02,853 --> 01:26:03,636
Shall we?

1687
01:26:03,767 --> 01:26:06,422
Yes, please.

1688
01:26:06,552 --> 01:26:08,598
The perfect woman, huh?

1689
01:26:08,728 --> 01:26:09,729
That's not me.

1690
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:11,035
I know.

1691
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,515
Me, neither.

1692
01:26:12,645 --> 01:26:14,952
We're perfect together.

1693
01:26:15,082 --> 01:26:17,172
That we are.
