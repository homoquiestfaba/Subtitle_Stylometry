1
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,606
Nice shot.

2
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,075
Thank you.

3
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,276
Nice form.

4
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,711
Yeah.

5
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,280
Nice balls?

6
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,587
Hey, Molly?

7
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,157
Molly?

8
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:01,094
Do you ever feel bad
about stealing for a living?

9
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,095
Why should I feel bad?

10
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:06,299
I'm just trying to survive
like everybody else.

11
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,734
Get down, now!

12
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,569
How 'bout you, Sam?

13
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,205
I don't feel bad about nothing.

14
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:13,807
On the floor!

15
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,907
Larry?

16
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,245
I don't know.

17
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,481
I've been doing it for so long,
it kinda feels natural now.

18
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,581
Ha-ha.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Hey, gimme that.

20
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,692
Why don't you ask Johnny how he feels?

21
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,761
Hey, Johnny?

22
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,463
You ever feel bad
about stealing for a living?

23
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,740
This is America, baby.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,476
Everybody steals.

25
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,146
Jane?

26
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,281
Thanks a lot for giving me
the day off yesterday.

27
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,182
I really appreciate it.

28
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:29,883
No problem, Molly.

29
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,684
Did you get your wedding dress finally?

30
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,654
I found the most beautiful
dress in the world.

31
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,156
I can't wait to show you.

32
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:40,160
Now all I need is something
blue and something borrowed.

33
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,260
Good luck.

34
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,713
This country was founded
on violence and crime.

35
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,950
How do you think the rich
got so rich to begin with?

36
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:09,355
See, the only difference today
is most people do it with a pen

37
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,455
instead of a gun.

38
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,386
How much did you say
this bank holds, Molly?

39
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,788
Couple hundred thousand.

40
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,888
In small bills.

41
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,719
You guys really think
we'll clear that much?

42
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,988
I mean, I know this ain't no
liquor store like we're used to,

43
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,690
but, I mean, that's not
a very big bank.

44
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,560
Maybe we should just stick
with what we know?

45
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,763
Al, we're in and out.

46
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,863
No sweat.

47
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:27,967
Excuse me.

48
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,536
Are you the manager?

49
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,837
Yes, how can I help you?

50
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,405
Well, I'll tell you.

51
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,974
I want to file a complaint
about an employee.

52
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,643
Which one?

53
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,812
That girl over there.

54
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:40,847
Molly?

55
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,751
Yeah, she's rude and insulting
and she made a mistake

56
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:45,618
on my deposit last week.

57
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,887
Here.

58
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,023
Right there.

59
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,365
What, are you getting
nervous on me now, Al?

60
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,567
No.

61
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,935
Not... not really.

62
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,337
I'm terribly sorry
about this, Mister...

63
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,305
Smith.

64
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,673
Mr. Smith. But...

65
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,042
No, no. The mistake
doesn't concern me.

66
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,142
It's her attitude that does.

67
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,923
We are sticking to what we know.

68
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:28,061
A little hole-in-the-wall operation
in an isolated neighborhood.

69
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,597
It's just like a liquor store,
but bigger.

70
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,367
See, only this time,
we come out with a real take,

71
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,669
not the petty cash we're pulling down.

72
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,804
Ready, Sam?

73
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,873
Let's do it.

74
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:41,741
Give us five minutes, Al.

75
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,609
Five minutes.

76
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,943
Don't sweat it, buddy.

77
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,043
♪ Here comes Santa Claus.

78
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,519
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells

79
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,655
♪ Jingle all the way

80
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,893
Just give me five minutes to
create a diversion and draw the

81
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,428
guard away from the entrance.

82
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,564
And then...

83
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,501
And then...

84
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,170
We're out of business. Forever.

85
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,646
Well, I know that
this is no excuse, but Molly

86
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,649
is getting married tomorrow
and she's a little bit on edge.

87
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,751
You can be sure that I will
have a talk with her.

88
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:25,752
A talk?

89
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,721
That's all you're gonna do
is have a talk?

90
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,490
What's going on?

91
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,590
I don't know.

92
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,767
Really, there's no need to get...

93
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,535
She deserves to be fired.

94
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,038
I mean, how can you let a
person like that work in this bank?

95
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,407
I want to close my account.

96
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,508
I'll see that everything is...

97
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,608
No, I want to close it right now.

98
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,480
Excuse me ma'am, is everything okay?

99
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,015
Merry Christmas,
ladies and gentlemen.

100
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,050
This is a hold-up.

101
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,452
Put your hands down.

102
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,622
That wouldn't be a smart idea, pal.

103
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,696
Don't hurt us.

104
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,931
Get down.

105
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:16,135
Ladies and gentlemen, we
want the bank's money, not yours.

106
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,438
So don't do anything stupid.

107
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,674
I hate to kill someone
just before Christmas.

108
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,544
Molly.

109
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,646
Get down now.

110
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,521
Now, open the vault.

111
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,662
Take that gun out of my face.

112
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,539
Let's go, lady.

113
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,639
Let's go.

114
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,818
Is this your idea
of "something borrowed"?

115
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,019
Sorry.

116
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,222
Move. Come on.

117
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,938
Fill it.

118
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,544
If I fill it, can I keep it?

119
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,965
Hundreds.

120
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,310
Hundreds.

121
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,980
Hundreds.

122
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,751
Where are the small bills?

123
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,953
Where are the small bills?

124
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,688
This is it.

125
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,223
What do you mean, this is it?

126
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,825
I mean this is it.

127
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,993
There are no small bills.

128
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,696
There never are.

129
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,231
Son of a bitch.

130
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,677
Look, you're running out of time.

131
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,245
You gotta get out of here.

132
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,381
You have no idea
what you're up against.

133
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,185
Guys, we're out of here right now.

134
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,086
Come on, Larry. Let's go.

135
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,121
Johnny, where's the goddamn money?

136
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,022
Forget the money.

137
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:50,890
We're walking.

138
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,625
What the hell are you talking...

139
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:53,659
It's a drop, now let's go.

140
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,594
What about our plans?

141
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,595
It's not gonna work.

142
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,629
It was a good plan, man.

143
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,197
Forget the plan.

144
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,131
It's history.

145
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,166
What do you mean, history?

146
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,101
We planned every
angle of this thing.

147
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,135
Quit arguing with me, man.

148
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,370
There's no time.

149
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,105
Let's get out of here, come on.

150
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,708
Son of a bitch.

151
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,083
Molly, let's go.

152
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,084
I'm almost finished.

153
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:18,784
Forget that. Come on.

154
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,920
Hey, what are you doing, man?

155
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,756
Are you telling me that we
came all this way for nothing?

156
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,859
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

157
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,803
Oh, shit.

158
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:38,971
What was that?

159
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,673
Shit.

160
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,974
Al's hit.

161
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,276
Those aren't cops.

162
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,376
Fuck.

163
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,955
That's it. Go, go!

164
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,055
Go, Molly!

165
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,202
Just break it.

166
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,221
Let's go! Come on!

167
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,523
Come on!

168
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,090
Where's Johnny?

169
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,058
He's coming.

170
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,158
Start the damn car.

171
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,910
I guess I don't need
that loan after all.

172
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,185
Damn it.

173
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,285
Come on. Let's go.

174
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,098
Damn.

175
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,965
What kind of leader are you, Johnny?

176
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,867
You said this was our last job.

177
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,935
Why the hell did we leave the money?

178
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:04,043
A little bank like that
doesn't handle all that cash.

179
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,245
Molly said a couple
hundred thousand.

180
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,347
They were sitting on millions.

181
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,315
Millions?

182
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,951
Yes, Molly. Millions.

183
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,953
We just left it?

184
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,956
You wanna mess with
the Vietnamese gangs?

185
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,191
Even the cops are
afraid to mess with them.

186
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,294
That's why they never
showed up at the bank.

187
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:25,264
If they're laundering
drug money through that bank,

188
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,364
we don't wanna know about it!

189
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,560
Sir.

190
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,662
Get out.

191
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:15,648
Talk.

192
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,683
Well, I'll tell you what I do know.

193
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:22,488
I shot my way out of a goddamn bank
and I got shit to show for it.

194
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,661
Well, Sam?

195
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,662
Don't you have something to say?

196
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,463
Yeah, I've got something to say.

197
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,331
Shut the hell up.

198
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,033
Yeah, well, screw you, man!

199
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,134
Come on!

200
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,270
Get your fucking hands off me.

201
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,306
I oughta kill both of you right now.

202
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,076
Any time you think you can, buddy.

203
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,250
What are you guys doing?

204
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,352
Watch it, Larry.

205
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,396
It wasn't my fault, Mr. Phan.

206
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,565
They escaped through the back.

207
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,035
I didn't think.

208
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,572
It's okay, Tran.

209
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,359
Hey.

210
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,728
Let's call it a draw.

211
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,530
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained, right?

212
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,069
No hard feelings?

213
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,775
Let's get the hell out of here.

214
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,618
Sam, I guess our
wedding's off tomorrow?

215
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,120
Sorry, baby.

216
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,456
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

217
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,325
So what do we do now, Johnny?

218
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,726
Just drive.

219
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,462
Give me time to think.

220
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,907
At least they didn't take anything.

221
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,681
Let me tell you something.

222
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,251
Life is face.

223
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,855
You lose one, and
you lose the other.

224
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,491
Do you think I can
ignore some street punks

225
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,591
that try to steal from me?

226
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,301
Here, put it on.

227
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,573
I can't believe Al's gone.

228
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,376
Yeah.

229
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,378
Well, a big screw-up if you ask me.

230
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,478
Nobody asked you.

231
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,819
Poor Al.

232
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:55,961
Christ, what are we gonna do
when the cops find his body, Johnny?

233
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,863
The Vietnamese will get rid of it.

234
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,200
They don't want the cops
involved any more than us.

235
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,768
So what now?

236
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,870
We stay low for a day.

237
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,708
Look, we didn't take anything
and none of their guys got hurt,

238
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,877
so they got no reason
to come after us.

239
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:16,580
So we just lay low and
maybe we move on.

240
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,226
I guess it's not gonna
be much of a Christmas.

241
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,727
I guess not.

242
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,497
He was really looking forward to it.

243
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,267
He wrapped all his
gifts to us himself.

244
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,236
What a mess.

245
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,938
So what are we
gonna do with his gifts?

246
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,473
Whose gifts?

247
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:46,409
Al. I think we should
say a rosary for him.

248
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,315
What do you think?

249
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,717
For Christ's sake, Molly.

250
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,651
I think maybe we have other

251
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,520
things to worry about
right now, don't you?

252
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,754
Sorry.

253
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:56,989
We should tell his family.

254
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,358
I think he has a sister
on the East Coast.

255
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,361
New York, New Jersey,
something like that.

256
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,262
Terrific.

257
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,129
And what are we gonna
do, call Information?

258
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,634
We should at least say a prayer.

259
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,939
He should have had a piece.

260
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,910
You know, I'm more interested
in making sure I won't need it.

261
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,978
All I'm saying is it's not right.

262
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,347
We should say a prayer for his soul.

263
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,683
For Christ's sake.

264
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,734
Hyah!

265
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,437
Hyah.

266
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,542
Two minutes, tops.

267
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,544
Take whatever you need,
and then we're out of here

268
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,644
forever.

269
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,729
Get dressed.

270
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,829
Where are we going?

271
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,032
Lemme see your I.D., please.

272
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,601
Yeah.

273
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,582
You look lovely tonight.

274
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,596
Talk to me.

275
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:58,997
Talk.

276
00:24:59,097 --> 00:24:59,965
They got away.

277
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,700
How many men did you send?

278
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,002
Seven men.

279
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,071
Let me get this straight.

280
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:10,542
You sent seven men and
those punks still got away.

281
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,676
Is that what you're telling me?

282
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,945
I just came from their apartment.

283
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,747
There's no trace of them and...

284
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,849
all of our men are dead.

285
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,252
They killed seven men?

286
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,958
Excuse me.

287
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,841
Seven men, Harry.

288
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:45,844
Do I have to do everything.

289
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,712
Myself nowadays?

290
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,015
I want those bastards' balls.

291
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,318
Do you understand?

292
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,188
I understand, Mr. Phan.

293
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,925
Good. Or I will have yours.

294
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,634
Go, now.

295
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,005
What the hell.

296
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,640
Are you looking at?

297
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,644
Honey, I think I'd like to go now.

298
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,846
Music, please.

299
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,057
Good.

300
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,625
What do you want me to do?

301
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,126
I work 16 hours a day already.

302
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,261
Hello?

303
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,063
All right, all right.

304
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:12,931
Hey, ya, Frank.

305
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,866
Shh.

306
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,134
What do you guys want?

307
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,903
Listen, we need a place to crash.

308
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:18,803
You know, the four of us.

309
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:19,804
What do you...

310
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:20,839
Who is it, Frankie?

311
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,375
It's just some friends, honey.

312
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,310
Are you guys crazy coming here?

313
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,045
I have a family now.

314
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:27,946
Daddy, where are you?

315
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:28,813
What, did you adopt?

316
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,782
Shh. It's all right, sweetheart.

317
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:31,816
I'm not going anywhere.

318
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,018
I'll be right there.

319
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,352
Please, do me a favor.

320
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,987
Get the hell out of here, okay?

321
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,789
Frank, we got nowhere
else to go, man.

322
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,424
Listen, I'll make it
worth your while.

323
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:40,292
Shh.

324
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,226
Come on, Frank.

325
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,227
Listen, we wouldn't come here

326
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,161
if we weren't desperate.

327
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,430
Johnny, you can keep
your money, okay?

328
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,331
I couldn't help you guys

329
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,699
even if I wanted to right now.

330
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,268
The word is out.

331
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,771
You're all dead men.

332
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,871
Get out of here.

333
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,077
Shit.

334
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,845
What the hell are we gonna do now?

335
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,948
Relax, will ya?

336
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,283
I got one more idea.

337
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,452
Bulldog?

338
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,687
That is a shit idea, John.

339
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,322
He's a wacko, man.

340
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,956
Well, Larry, got a better idea?

341
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,173
Vietnamese mafia?

342
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,213
Well, my ass would be in a world

343
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,281
of shit if anyone found out

344
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,017
I was holding you here, Johnny.

345
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:43,955
But I do owe you, and
I always pay my debts.

346
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:44,990
Thanks, Bulldog.

347
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,858
Save it.

348
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,958
As of now, we're even.

349
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,501
Well, we're okay, okay?

350
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,470
Now let's get the
stuff out of the van.

351
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,404
You sure it's all right?

352
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,505
Yeah, it's okay.

353
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,605
Let's go.

354
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,911
How long are they gonna be here?

355
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,513
A couple of days, week at the most.

356
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:09,981
A week?

357
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,915
Come on, Tammy.

358
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:11,783
Johnny saved my life.

359
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:12,450
Be hospitable.

360
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,818
You're too nice, Bulldog.

361
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,988
You always let people
take advantage of you.

362
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,926
Quite a place you got here.

363
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:25,930
Got rations and supplies
for the next five years.

364
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,134
The Apocalypse is
coming, my friend. I'm ready.

365
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,301
Yeah, well, if it ain't

366
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,770
coming in the next few minutes,

367
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,339
I'd like to get some sleep.

368
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,374
So sleep.

369
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,810
I'll see you in the morning, Johnny?

370
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,912
Make that afternoon.

371
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,350
Sam?

372
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,852
I never killed anybody before.

373
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,060
We're gonna get through this, Molly.

374
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Trust me.

375
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,900
And when we do,
we're gonna get married,

376
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,402
just like we planned.

377
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,404
Catholic?

378
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,306
Catholic.

379
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,974
Promise me, Sam.

380
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,076
I promise, baby.

381
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,857
So now what do we do?

382
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,326
I got us into this
and I'll get us out.

383
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,428
When?

384
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,033
Now.

385
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,367
What? Where are you going?

386
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,402
Don't worry.

387
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,403
I won't take long.

388
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,605
Be back in a couple hours.

389
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,280
Are you staying?

390
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,517
Perhaps.

391
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,485
Can I get you anything?

392
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,021
Listen.

393
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:35,024
If I want anything,
I will let you know.

394
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,031
Come here.

395
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,769
Got a light?

396
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:43,087
Why did you warn me in the back?

397
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,655
For once, I wanted him to lose.

398
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:54,599
A man who hits a woman is a coward.

399
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,059
Guys?

400
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,660
You guys, wake up.

401
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,796
Hey, wake up.

402
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,104
Here.

403
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,205
This will keep the swelling down.

404
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,714
Who did this?

405
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,816
The man you tried to rob.

406
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,721
I guess it's more
complicated than I thought.

407
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,589
You should leave him.

408
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,257
You don't just leave Victor.

409
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,460
Phan unless it's in a coffin.

410
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,796
I've got to get my
friends out of this mess.

411
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,669
Victor Phan has partners.

412
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,739
Very powerful partners.

413
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,607
If you'd taken all that money,

414
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:10,808
they'd have had his head.

415
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,908
So what do I do now?

416
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,714
There's an old saying.

417
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,386
"If you cut the dragon,
you'd better slay him."

418
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,754
So far, you've only cut him.

419
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,359
There's no way
Johnny would betray us.

420
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,560
Maybe he just left us.

421
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,796
Come on, Larry.

422
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,398
I know where he went.

423
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,166
He asked for Jane's address.

424
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,267
The bank manager?

425
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,603
Doesn't she work for the Vietnamese?

426
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,672
How much money did
you say he keeps there?

427
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,808
Five million.

428
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,611
So what do I do?

429
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,213
Hit the bank again?

430
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,615
Won't work.

431
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,484
Security's been increased.

432
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:59,190
Then what?

433
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,591
I'm your ticket out of this, Johnny.

434
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,429
And you're mine.

435
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:12,437
As long as Phan
lives, I'll never be free.

436
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:17,175
So if I do this, it's
under one condition.

437
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,743
I'm listening.

438
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,213
Phan must die.

439
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,716
Do you understand me?

440
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,252
Keep talking.

441
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:32,356
On Christmas Eve, the
nightclub will be closed.

442
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:35,293
Phan'll be there with
his partners, handing over

443
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:36,761
the money to be laundered.

444
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,962
If you hit him at 10,

445
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:40,731
the partners won't be there yet.

446
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,850
Where the hell you been, Johnny?

447
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,017
Looking for a solution.

448
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,887
We got a lot to talk about.

449
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,987
Take a seat, guys.

450
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,265
We've known each
other for a long time now.

451
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,302
When we first met, we were

452
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,438
all living on the streets.

453
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,542
To tell you the truth, I
never expected any of us

454
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,944
to survive this long.

455
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,046
But we did.

456
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,984
We did because we're a team.

457
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,888
We got an opportunity here.

458
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,624
One job, one hit.

459
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,293
We get them off our
backs and we come out

460
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,327
with enough money to live

461
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,930
for the rest of our lives.

462
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,800
But there's one thing
we gotta consider here.

463
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,970
We're dealing with a
very dangerous situation

464
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,072
and we could all get killed.

465
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:03,681
Whatever we decide,
we do it together...

466
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,050
or we don't do it at all.

467
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,693
They're coming after us.

468
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,796
What difference does it
make who shoots first?

469
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,070
I'm in.

470
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:31,375
I don't see any other choice.

471
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,475
It's the only chance we have.

472
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,751
Well, Sam?

473
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,321
It's up to you.

474
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,591
We all go or none of us goes.

475
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:52,563
The way I see it,
we're all dead anyway.

476
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,666
So let's go for it.

477
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,103
All right.

478
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,944
How's it going?

479
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:08,679
Just fine.

480
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,414
Pictures.

481
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,516
Thanks.

482
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,122
Good job, Bulldog.

483
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:19,023
Hey, man.

484
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,123
I wanna talk to you.

485
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,428
Listen, Tammy and I have
been thinking this over.

486
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,631
We want to be in on the job.

487
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,833
No dice, Bulldog.

488
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,668
I'm helping you out here, Johnny.

489
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,570
And I helped you.

490
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,437
Now we're even.

491
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,105
No...

492
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,906
Listen, listen.

493
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,642
Just calm down, Bulldog.

494
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:38,676
You're overzealous.

495
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,511
That's what got you in trouble

496
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:43,047
last time, and I had to
bail you out, remember?

497
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,783
I'm not gonna take that risk.

498
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,451
You gonna screw me, Johnny?

499
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,020
You got nothing to
worry about, buddy.

500
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,922
We're all agreed to give
you and Tammy a cut

501
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:52,857
for putting us up.

502
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:53,824
Two cuts.

503
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:54,725
One for each of us.

504
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,460
One for both of you.

505
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,495
Yours.

506
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,797
You can split it with
Tammy if you want.

507
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,665
Now, listen.

508
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,466
You can meet us at the bikers' bar

509
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,134
after the job is done.

510
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,168
We'll be heading over there

511
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,170
to pick up the passports.

512
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,171
Now, excuse me.

513
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:11,075
I gotta mail these pictures to Paco.

514
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:44,975
Hello.

515
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,111
Hi.

516
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,526
Here are some drawings
of the club as best

517
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,527
as I could do them.

518
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,030
Thanks.

519
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,682
What's the matter?

520
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,784
I'm sorry.

521
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:32,790
It's just... it's hard
for me to trust anyone.

522
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,127
It's okay.

523
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,899
It's okay.

524
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,984
What about my cut?

525
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,986
I should get one of
my own, shouldn't I?

526
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,789
I'm the one who's
been cooking, cleaning,

527
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,591
washing blankets,
everything else around here.

528
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:41,325
I know, I know.

529
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:44,628
It ain't right, Bulldog,
okay? These people

530
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,664
are supposed to be your friends.

531
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,132
Acquaintances.

532
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:53,804
Whatever. These people,
they don't respect you.

533
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,907
They think you're a loser.

534
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,584
You know what I think?

535
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:07,818
I think we should teach Johnny

536
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,054
a little lesson in ethics.

537
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,957
Let him take all the
money and all the risk.

538
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,058
And then we take it from him

539
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,227
when we go to get our cut.

540
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,929
I always knew there
was a reason I loved you.

541
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,764
Besides those good looks.

542
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,933
Come to Daddy.

543
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,325
Just relax, okay?

544
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,064
Let's go.

545
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,166
Let's do it.

546
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,172
Gentlemen, this is it?

547
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:28,859
Come on.

548
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,994
Bring on the champagne.

549
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:53,410
Johnny, come on, let's go.

550
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,411
I got the money.

551
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:55,279
Let's get out of here.

552
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:56,413
No!

553
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,447
Let's get the hell outta here.

554
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,022
Let's go.

555
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,159
Come on, come on, come on.

556
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,382
You told me he would be killed.

557
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,218
What about the girl?

558
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,353
Well, he shot her anyway, didn't he?

559
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,055
Well, what do you wanna do?

560
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:38,922
You want to go back?

561
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,392
You want to try to kill him now?

562
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:45,162
How about you, Larry?

563
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,631
Well, that's no longer
an option now, is it?

564
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,066
You guys don't get it.

565
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,934
He's gonna follow us wherever we go.

566
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,170
He's not gonna stop
until we're all dead.

567
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,606
Listen, Jane... Hey.

568
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,941
Don't touch me.

569
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,015
Let's just all relax.

570
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:08,252
Jesus Christ, Johnny.

571
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,254
Where you gonna go, Jane?

572
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,523
You told me yourself
he's gonna find you.

573
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:16,126
The only way to
come out of this alive

574
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,629
is to stick together.

575
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:24,201
We gotta stick to our plan.

576
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,009
Listen, I will get him.

577
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,111
I promise.

578
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,915
Keep driving, Molly.

579
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,015
We stay with our plan.

580
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,523
Molly, step on it, would ya?

581
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,530
Ready to collect our money?

582
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,732
I'm with you, baby.

00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,582
How long is this going to take?

584
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,251
We deal with Paco, pay off Bulldog,

585
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,351

620
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,686
some Christmas shopping to do.

as I got the photos.

How much do I owe you?

10 Gs.

628

630
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:39,896
It's for you, Mr. Phan.

00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:42,666
Yeah, who is it?

632
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,234
Al Capone.

633
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:45,202
Who?

634
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:47,204
The guy who just robbed your ass.

635
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:49,673
Look, I got the dough.

636
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,376

637
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,177
I got the dough.

638
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,812
Yeah, all the money.

639
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,581
How do I know it's you?

640
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:58,582
You want me to tell you

641
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,851
about the chick you
just shot in the nightclub?

642
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,552
Don't screw with me.

643
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:03,587
I'm here, so's your money.

644
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:04,454
You want it or not?

645
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:05,322
All of it?

646
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,256
That's right.

647
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,990
All $5 million.

648
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,361
You got my girl?

649
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,196
Yeah, yeah. She's with us.

650
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,198
What do you want?

651
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,300
25% of the cash.

652
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,903
You must be kidding me.

653
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:23,573
25% of the cash or no deal.

654
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:26,343
All right, all right.

655
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:28,745
You got a deal.

656
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:29,813
Where are you?

657
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,716
Right now we're at the
Full Circle Bar in Indio.

658
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,519
If we're not here when
you get here, we're heading

659
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,621
to the Sunshine Hotel
in Yuma, Arizona.

660
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,723
You got that?

661
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,427
Sunshine Hotel, Yuma, Arizona.

662
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,762
You just be there.

663
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,834
So, Johnny, my man.

664
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,670
Now that we're square,
I gotta get out of here.

665
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,705
You know what I mean?

666
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:57,874
It's Christmas Eve.

667
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,776
I gotta go to church.

668
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:01,711
I'm reading the Epistle tonight.

669
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,281
Be good, man.

670
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,366
So now that you're rich,
are you gonna try to find

671
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,569
another girl to replace me?

672
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:06,570
Molly, look.

673
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:11,374
I know I've done
some terrible things,

674
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,510
but, baby, you're all I got.

675
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:19,516
And I swear I'll
never, ever leave you.

676
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,911
So, Slick, what's in the bag?

677
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:01,651
Who wants to know?

678
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,719
We all do.

679
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,824
Dog food.

680
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,494
We like dog food.

681
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,897
Doesn't surprise me.

682
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:15,865
So why don't you just hand it over?

683
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,933
So why don't you
just come and get it?

684
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,141
Aw, hell, Johnny.

685
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:26,476
If these boys really want

686
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:30,714
our dog food, why don't
we just give it to 'em?

687
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,449
Yeah.

688
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,684
You really think so, buddy?

689
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,487
Shit, yeah.

690
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,587
Look at how underfed they are.

691
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,793
Well, if they really want
it, why don't you just

692
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,893
give it to them?

693
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,097
Ooh!

694
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,156
Come on. Let's go!

695
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,724
What about Bulldog?

696
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:57,126
Send him a postcard.

697
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,800
Shit.

698
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:10,104
What'd you do that for, asshole?

699
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:12,974
Molly...

700
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:18,748
Sam? Sam!

701
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:21,784
Sam! Sam! Sam's shot.

702
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:22,685
What?

703
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,989
Sam! Sam's hit.

704
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:26,990
Sam's hit.

705
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,224
Do something.

706
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:30,126
Hang on, Sam.

707
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:31,928
Hang on, Sam.

708
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,028
Come on, hold in there.

709
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:37,233
Sam.

710
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,868
Sam.

711
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,968
Sam.

712
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,139
Sam!

713
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,707
No!

714
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:49,012
No, no.

715
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,947
Hang on, Sam!

716
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,349
Sam, hang on!

717
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:54,951
Sam, wake up!

718
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,119
Wake up, Sam.

719
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:59,122
Come on. I love you.

720
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,390
Sam.

721
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:04,227
Now we're never gonna get married.

722
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,729
Do something.

723
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,831
Do something!

724
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:15,071
Sam, we're... We're
gonna get married

725
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,908
and now he's dead.

726
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:35,358
Dear brethren, we are
gathered here today...

727
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,127
Come on.

728
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:40,930
Speed it up, will ya?

729
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:45,735
Sorry, Father.

730
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:49,339
Please.

731
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:54,777
Do you, Sam, take Molly
to be your wedded wife?

732
01:01:54,877 --> 01:02:00,049
To love and cherish,
to honor and respect,

733
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:04,988
in sickness and in
health, now and forever...

734
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:08,357
till death do you part?

735
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,896
He says he does.

736
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,834
Very well.

737
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:18,901
Do you, Molly...

738
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:21,070
Yes, I do.

739
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:26,075
By the power vested in
me from Almighty God...

740
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:29,946
Jesus Christ, would you
kiss the groom already?

741
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,005

We all do.

762
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:46,889
It's dog food.

763
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,492
You want some?

764
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,148
I'm looking for some
folks with a bag like mine.

765
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:13,416
Looks like they've been here.

766
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,485
Hey, tell him about
the Sunshine thing.

767
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:16,486
You know, the Sunshine Hotel.

768
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:17,520
Tell him.

769
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:18,855
Tell me.

770
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:19,622
Th-they said they were going

771
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:22,158
to the Sunshine Hotel, Yuma.

772
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,327
Th-that's all I know.

773
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:31,067
Thank you, boys.

774
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,958
Look at my bar.

775
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:44,640
Sunshine Hotel,
Yuma, Arizona, and we

776
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,109
don't want your dog food.

777
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:51,414
Where's your bathroom?

778
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,025
I love you, Sam.

779
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:07,730
I'll always, always love you.

780
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:19,442
Honey, we gotta go.

781
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:21,644
I can't leave him like this.

782
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:26,382
You're not really leaving him.

783
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,251
Sam is always gonna be with you.

784
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:29,352
Come on, Johnny.

785
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,554
God damn it.

786
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:32,455
You know, what...

787
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,490
What you and Sam had,

788
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,760
that was special.

789
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,065
You think so?

790
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,267
Yeah.

791
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:51,140
When it comes to love,

792
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,309
there is no distance of death.

793
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:55,444
Really?

794
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,246
Absolutely.

795
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:01,450
I'd give everything I
ever had for one day

796
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,719
of what you and Sam had.

797
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,805
What are we doing, Johnny?

798
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,674
We gotta bury him.

799
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:25,675
Jesus Christ.

800
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:29,111
We don't have time for that shit.

801
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,414
We're talking about Sam, Larry.

802
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:35,451
We can't just leave
him there like that.

803
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:39,455
Here. Let's get it
over with, all right?

804
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:00,142
Molly, you told me you had a family.

805
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:03,512
That was just a cover at the bank.

806
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:08,384
Sam and Johnny and Larry...

807
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:11,120
The only family I ever had.

808
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,325
Do you have any family, Jane?

809
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,527
No.

810
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:22,665
Well, you're with us now.

811
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,381
How could you get
a goddamn flat tire?

812
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,182
We're never gonna get that money.

813
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,150
We'll get there, baby.

814
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,418
I promise.

815
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:43,285
Yeah, right.

816
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:45,421
I always keep my word.

817
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:29,732
Carlo?

818
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,601
Johnny!

819
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:34,701
Long time no see?

820
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:39,642
I don't believe my eyes.

821
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,944
Each time I see you, you look

822
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:43,879
like exactly your father.

823
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,582
A very fine man.

824
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,752
How you doin', Carlo?

825
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,220
Better, better, man.

826
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,521
I must tell you.

827
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:55,458
I still miss this, though.

828
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:57,226
Listen.

829
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:58,260
Remember Larry, Molly?

830
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,228
Sure.

831
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,328
This is Jane.

832
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:11,640
Hey, where is Sammy?

833
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,776
He didn't make it.

834
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,411
I'm sorry.

835
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,980
Listen, did you get my reservation?

836
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,683
Si, si. Don't worry, Johnny.

837
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:24,286
I take care of everything.

838
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,388
That's for you.

839
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:31,293
You're very generous, Johnny.

840
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,332
Do you know how much I love you?

841
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,400
Do you know how
much I love your father?

842
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,337
And just your money's no good here.

843
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:44,340
By the way, I only
have three bedrooms.

844
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,408
The hotel is, under...

845
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:48,677
under...

846
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,750
Renovation?

847
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,452
Renovation.

848
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:59,822
This English language
drives me nuts.

849
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,024
Anyway, I have the best

850
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:04,426
three bedrooms in the house.

851
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:11,834
21...

852
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,303
22...

853
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:15,704
23.

854
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:18,540
Enjoy your stay.

855
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:23,579
Let's go.

856
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:39,061
Sorry.

857
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:41,764
So how do you know Carlo?

858
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:45,000
He's my father's cousin from Sicily.

859
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,669
He ran into some trouble with

860
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,572
a New York mobster and he made

861
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:52,374
an offer they couldn't refuse,

862
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:54,443
so they basically
tried to kill him instead.

863
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,378
Ee-ee.

864
01:11:56,478 --> 01:12:02,384
Now he runs this hotel and...

865
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:04,320
he occasionally sells cars.

866
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,522
He sells cars?

867
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:08,490
Well, stolen.

868
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,427
He dumps them in Mexico.

869
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:17,933
Today's Christmas.

870
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:24,340
I never really had a real Christmas.

871
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,440
Well, now you do.

872
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,742
Johnny.

873
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:31,413
It's beautiful.

874
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:38,387
Merry Christmas.

875
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:51,160
Johnny! Johnny, open up!

876
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,629
It's the wrong time.

877
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,764
Come on, Johnny.

878
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:56,932
Open the goddamn door.

879
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:59,032
Come on.

880
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:02,571
The Vietnamese are here.

881
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:03,639
I'll get my guns.

882
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:04,506
I'm with you.

883
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:05,607
Okay. Johnny.

884
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,707
What?

885
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,795
Buon giorno, signori.

886
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:32,234
Can I help you?

887
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:45,180
I guess not.

888
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:48,550
Where are they?

889
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:51,620
Why don't you try upstairs?

890
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,556
Grazie.

891
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,059
You looking for me, Phan?

892
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:11,140
No.

893
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,875
Her.

894
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:14,977
Send her down.

895
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:17,813
Forget about it.

896
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:18,914
You let me get a mile

897
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:21,550
down the road, I'll drop her off

898
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,650
and your share of the money.

899
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:30,159
How could anyone be so stupid?

900
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:32,628
That is the question.

901
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:49,178
He sold you out.

902
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:51,713
Did he?

903
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:56,184
Did you, Larry?

904
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:07,829
Nah.

905
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,635
You didn't really think I could

906
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,638
betray Johnny, now, did you?

907
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,307
Why... why'd you hit him?

908
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,042
Realism.

909
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:23,745
We didn't know if
you could act, baby.

910
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,288
Just like in Sicily.

911
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:35,224
The best time.

912
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:37,326
Welcome to the web, Phan.

913
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:41,864
Said the spider to a stupid fly.

914
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:45,298
Get the rest of your men inside.

915
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:57,846
Out, Bulldog.

916
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:59,946
Hey, Johnny.

917
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:07,823
Move, move. Move, Jane.

918
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:09,057
Come on.

919
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:11,193
Come on.

920
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,978
Jane, you ever use
one of these before?

921
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:32,214
Guess so.

922
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,885
Get down and we
hit them from behind.

923
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,985
Come on.

924
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:07,215
Johnny!

925
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:09,317
You son of a bitch!

926
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:37,879
Come on, go.

927
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:39,979
Let's go.

928
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,319
Get him out!

929
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:52,761
Molly, come on.

930
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:36,503
Through here!

931
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:40,406
Johnny!

932
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:53,522
One cut?

933
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:56,058
Yeah, well, Tammy's dead, Johnny.

934
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:59,192
So I guess I don't have
to split my cut with her?

935
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,529
I'll cut you in.

936
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:06,161
How could you betray me like this?

937
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:08,396
It was easy.

938
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:26,174
You belong with me.

939
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:19,561
What a pity.

940
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,463
Greed will always kill you.

941
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:24,099
Go to hell, Johnny.

942
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:28,203
No, pal. You're the
one who's going to hell.

943
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:40,508
Molly.

944
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:41,443
Molly?

945
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:45,146
Shh. It's over.

946
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,248
Okay?

947
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:49,350
It's over.

948
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:52,487
Shh.

949
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:09,437
Good try, amigo.

950
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:11,906
Go and get the cars.

951
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,855
A few inches lower and
you really would've had

952
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,523
a problem.

953
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:30,358
Only me?

954
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:34,496
You're pretty confident, aren't you?

955
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:38,264
Yah.

956
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:39,801
Excuse me.

957
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:41,901
All right.

958
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:45,671
You're confident, too.

959
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:50,412
Giovanni.

960
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:52,714
Carlo.

961
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:56,551
Well, I'm really sorry
about everything.

962
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:57,886
Don't worry about it.

963
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:00,221
I don't have enough money, anyway,

964
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:02,824
to finish the job.

965
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:13,568
Well, now you do.

966
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:17,336
Ciao.

967
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:21,476
Let's go.

968
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:29,451
Arrivederci.

969
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:31,619
Arrivederci.

970
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:43,264
Mamma mia!

971
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:48,002
Johnny, you're just
like your father. Crazy!

972
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:06,545
Shut up.
