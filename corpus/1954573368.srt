00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,636
[Both chuckle]

184
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,502
How are things going with that?

185
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,539
- Great.

186
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,202
Um, we just introduced
two new flavors,

187
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,123
and we're going to be
in Whole Foods next month.

188
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,779
Yeah, I just...

189
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,440
you know,
I thought it would be fun.

190
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,382
I totally understand
if nobody wants any of it.

191
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,417
- Don't be absurd.

192
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,783
Of course people will drink it.

193
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,081
It's water.

194
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,553
[Chuckling]

195
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,719
Go ahead and get yourself
settled in the guest house.

196
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,389
It looks like Roger
might need you.

197
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,298
And try to find out
what he's so upset about.

198
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,765
- [Sighs]

199
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,613
- We brought you this.

200
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,316
- [Gasps]

201
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,790
Oh.

202
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,816
Oh, thank you.

203
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
- [Chuckles]

204
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,658
- This is perfect.

205
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,392
You know I hate getting things.

206
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,432
[Groans]

207
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,559
I mean, where would I put them?

208
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,296
This place is completely full.

209
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,530
I mean, this is wonderful...

210
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,302
preserves,
mandarin pumpkin butter.

211
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,570
Oh, ginger Asian pear.

212
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,875
We can eat this all up,
throw this away,

213
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,711
and it'll be
like it was never here.

214
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,307
- I'm so glad.
- Mm.

215
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,612
- Whoo!

216
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,652
Whoo!

217
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,211
- What in the world?

218
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,721
- Hey!
- Whoo!

219
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,246
- That was great.

220
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,781
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

221
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,224
- Oh!

222
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,326
- What are you guys doing?

223
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,660
Dropping by?
I love it.

224
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,689
Nobody drops by anymore.

225
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,733
- [Laughs]

226
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,734
- Mwah.
- Mwah.

227
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,260
- It was nothing.
- We were in the neighborhood.

228
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,637
- Oh, look at you two, swimming.

229
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,232
Oh, my God,
every time I come up here,

230
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,367
I think I'm gonna go in,

231
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,345
and then the whole time passes,
and I forget to do it.

232
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,539
This is...

233
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,515
- Ooh, that feels good.
- Whoo-hoo!

234
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,549
- So are you going

235
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,848
to the "Save the Lake" benefit
on Sunday?

236
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,354
- I think we have to.

237
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,549
Did you want to join my table?

238
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,957
- Oh, we already have
our tickets.

239
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:58,630
Veronika asked us
if we wanted to be her guests.

240
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,326
- Bring this down.

241
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,367
That's great.

242
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,733
- Both?

243
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,770
Really?
- Mm.

244
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,535
- Oh, did you hear
that she's, um,

245
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,769
going to do more construction?

246
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,902
- You're kidding me.

247
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,812
After everything that we went
through while she rebuilt that?

248
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:19,249
- I thought you were gonna do
something more on your house.

249
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,285
- Actually...

250
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,650
[sighs]

251
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,588
Malcolm and I, uh,

252
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,818
have talked about selling

253
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,348
and doing something simple.

254
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,393
- No.
- No.

255
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,394
- Please don't tell anybody.

256
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,725
We're still not sure
if it's gonna happen.

257
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,763
- You're not.
- You can't.

258
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:32,890
- I mean, we probably won't.

259
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,695
The kids should get the house
anyway.

260
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,328
I mean, God knows they don't
even appreciate it,

261
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,966
but maybe a younger family
would enjoy it more.

262
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:47,404
I wish I could be one of those
people who can just let go.

263
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,914
- Sweetie, you can't let go
of anything.

264
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,814
- Why not just keep the house

265
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:52,851
as an investment?

266
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,375
- Ah, the market...

267
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,253
It seems decadent to own two...

268
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,813
vacation houses.

269
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,689
- Celia Green.

270
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,954
- What?

271
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,484
- You have more money

272
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,588
than entire ZIP codes
in San Francisco.

273
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,996
You can afford
to keep both houses.

274
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,864
- I know.

275
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,869
I know.

276
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,962
It's just...

277
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,005
[sighs]

278
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,803
You reach an age...

279
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,967
Um...

280
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:21,503
I'm... I'm so tired of my life
being safe.

281
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,276
- Mm-hmm.

282
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,951
- But this house...

283
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,580
They don't make houses
like this anymore.

284
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:30,622
- Mm-mm.

285
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,920
- I-I don't know who else
deserves to live here.

286
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,653
[Ducks quacking]

287
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,559
- Remind me
why we're here again?

288
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:37,857
- What were we going to do...

289
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,762
Spend the weekend in Westwood?

290
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,460
[Sighs]

291
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,331
Oh, you...

292
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,369
[sighs]

293
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,370
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

294
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,666
- Oh, okay.
I get it.

295
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,674
Theo Green.

296
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,700
So high school friend
wants a movie deal.

297
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,744
Is it any good?

298
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,972
Have you even read it yet?

299
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,013
- Don't be a brat.

300
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,038
Theo just sent it to me
a few weeks ago.

301
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,723
I mean, what do you do
when you're staying

302
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,751
at someone's house,

303
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,515
eating their food, and you have
to critique their work?

304
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,523
- Well, what do you tell all
the other wannabe screenwriters?

305
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,582
- Usually, I just say,

306
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,526
"It's good. It's great.

307
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,756
I'll get back to you
with notes,"

308
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,423
and then I just...

309
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,657
don't.

310
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,660
- Well, at least wait
until the end of the weekend

311
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,000
to tell him how you feel.

312
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,805
- Yeah.

313
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,846
- Everything's gonna be
all right.

314
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,512
- I know.

315
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,577
- [Sighs]

316
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,111
- [Chuckles]

317
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,862
- Does Mom need any help?

318
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,527
- Uh, don't worry about it.

319
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,129
You work hard.

320
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,965
You deserve to relax.

321
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,007
[Sighs]

322
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,407
I guess that's the thing now,

323
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,742
Fridays off.

324
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,010
All the young people
take Fridays off in the summer.

325
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,016
- It's Labor Day weekend, Dad.

326
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,678
- I didn't take a Friday off
until I turned 50.

327
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,153
- Well...

328
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,521
Does she need any help?

329
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,582
- No, she said she had it
under control.

330
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,118
- [Sighs]

331
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,593
- Ooh.

332
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,459
Ha-ha.

333
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,063
- [Sighs]

334
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,941
- Where's everyone else?

335
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,735
- Don't you have another, uh,

336
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,644
friend coming?

337
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,411
- Blake and her guest
are arriving later.

338
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,450
Ooh.

339
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,419
- I can't believe that you're
friends with Blake Curtis.

340
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,579
[Chuckles]

341
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,055
Why would she want to be friends
with a writer on her show?

342
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,182
- Oh, shut up, Roger.

343
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,687
- Isn't that like hanging out
with the help?

344
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,751
- She likes the lines
that I write for her.

345
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:50,795
- Well,

346
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,458
you certainly decided
to bring an entourage with you.

347
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,467
- You used to bring your frat
buddies up here all the time.

348
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,221
- They were my brothers.
- Uh, actually, no.

349
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,528
I'm your brother.

350
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,869
- Well, at least I don't bring

351
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,739
B-list TV actresses
whose ass I'm kissing.

352
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,607
- I love Blake Curtis.

353
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,509
We watch The Boardroom
every Sunday.

354
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,912
- You watch The Boardroom
every Sunday.

355
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,713
- See, I have the unconditional
support of my family.

356
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,809
Should we try the lake?

357
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,115
- Thought you said
it was freezing.

358
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,746
- It'll turn your balls
into popcorn kernels.

359
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,789
[Laughter]

360
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,085
- That's so funny.
- Mm-hmm-hmm.

361
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,786
- Yeah, 'cause you already have
popcorn kernel balls.

362
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,055
- Ow! Ow!

363

[Laughs]
- Wow.

542
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,541
- Sorry I'm late.

543
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,531
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

544
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,576
- Hello.

545
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,408
- Thank you so much
for having me, Mrs. Green.

546
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,209
Thank you.
- Oh, uh, Celia, please.

547
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,306
- [Chuckles]

548
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,112
- Let me introduce everyone.

549
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,617
This is Malcolm, my husband.

550
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:54,852
- Hi.

551
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,480
- Nora, Sean, Luke...
- Mm-hmm.

552
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,353
- Roger, my other son,

553
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,517
and Vanessa.

554
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,559
- Hi.

555
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,460
- And you know Maria, of course.
- I do, yes.

556
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,587
- I'll bring the bags
up to your room.

557
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,064
- Thank you.
Thanks so much.

558
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,533
Um, oh, and I have, uh,

559
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,035
a little bit of something.

560
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,069
- Oh.
- Thank you.

561
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,265
- Oh.
- Look at that smile.

562
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,900
She's such a dirty star fucker.

563
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,911
- Um, I would love a shower
if that's okay?

564
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,242
- Yeah, sure. I'll...
- Yeah?

565
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,577
- I'll take you up to your room.
- Great.

566
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,013
- Okay, all right.
- Come on.

567
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,346
- [Chuckles]

568
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,012
- Ooh.
- She's sweet and...

569
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:31,545
- She is so much smaller
than I thought she would be.

570
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,387
- Oh, actors always are.

571
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,155
- I thought she'd be
more top-heavy.

572
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,627
- That's not what I meant.

573
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:41,121
- You know, I had
the most incredible breasts

574
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,293
when I was 23.

575
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,030
I-I didn't even have
to wear a bra.

576
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,128
- Eh.
- It's true.

577
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,171
- Wow.

578
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,638
- Now she's gonna show you
pictures of your honeymoon

579
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:49,674
in Saint-Tropez.

580
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,267
- I think I have
some of those pictures.

581
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,572
- I know I do.

582
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,010
[Laughter]

583
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,377
- You okay?
You all right?

584
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,642
- I'm sorry,
I just... I can't...

585
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:57,682
No, I can't breathe.

586
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,650
- Give him some water.
- He's choking.

587
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,174
- Does anybody know
the Heimlich?

588
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,209
- Jesus.
- Here, take... take some water.

589
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,312
You want some water?

590
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,687
Oh, my God,
his neck is all... is all red.

591
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,118
- Is he allergic to the salmon?

592
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,923
- Uh, we need... we need that...
that allergy thing,

593
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:10,961
that thing you bought...

594
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:11,929
- I don't know
if I still have it.

595
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:12,952
I don't remember.
- Well, did you use it?

596
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,363
- I'm not sure. I don't know.
- Well, let... let's look for it.

597
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,399
- All right.
- Here.

598
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,095
- Get him some water.
- Drink some water.

599
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,159
- Have you used it?
- Of course not.

600
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,535
I didn't use it.
I just don't know where it is.

601
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:21,732
[Inhales and exhales sharply]

602
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,100
[Clattering]

603
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,574
It's so messy under here.

604
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,203
I keep meaning to reorgan...
Roger!

605
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,685
Roger, please don't make
such a mess.

606
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,615
- Well, at least help me.
- All right, all right.

607
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,650
[Sighs]

608
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,675
Tampons?
What are these doing here?

609
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,688
- Oh, Mom, come on.
Focus.

610
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,019
You have to find it.

611
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,648
- Well, it could be anywhere.

612
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,215
I mean, does he really need it?

613
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,454
That needle is expensive.

614
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,689
$75.

615
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,324
I mean, what if someone gets
a bee sting this weekend?

616
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,993
- Would you like him
to die instead?

617
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,592
- No, of course not.

618
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:53,069
[Sighs] Oh, here it is.

619
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,265
Take it.

620
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,699
- Whoa, what...
what are you doing?

621
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,371
- Luke's having an allergic
reaction to something.

622
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,401
I've got to give him this.
- What?

623
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,209
Wait, well, do you know
what you're doing?

624
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,248
Allergic to what?

625
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,341
- Local discount salmon,
I guess!

626
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,385
- [Wheezing]

627
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,614
- Roger's coming.
You're gonna be fine.

628
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,382
He's got the medicine, okay?

629
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,185
- Oh, oh, my God.

630
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,486
Okay.
- Mm.

631
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,525
[Grunts]
- Oh!

632
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,550
- Count to 15.
- Ten seconds.

633
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,595
- [Gasps]

634
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,097
- It says to rub the puncture
area after.

635
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,623
- On three, two, one.

636
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,066
- Be careful with that.

637
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,102
Someone could get hurt.

638
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,103
- Are you okay?

639
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,401
- [Sighs]
- Hey, hey, hey.

640
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,373
Hey, can you breathe?

641
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,239
- Yeah.

642
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,675
- You feeling better?
- You poor thing.

643
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,339
Have you ever eaten salmon
before?

644
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,404
- Mom!

645
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,574
- No, I haven't had it
that much.

646
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:38,616
- See, there you go.

647
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,050
- Okay, Mom, what does it
matter, okay?

648
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,712
- All right.
- Come on, let's go inside.

649
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,753
You okay?
- Yeah.

650
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,085
- Okay, come on.
Can you walk?

651
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,181
- Ah, I'm sorry, everybody.
I...

652
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,657
- That's okay.

653
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,159
- Oh, my God.

654
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,025
- You.

655
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,062
Come with me.

656
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,097
- Do not speak to me.

657
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,497
- Come with me now.
- Take your hand...

658
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,433
Take your hands off me.
- Then walk by yourself.

659
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,730
- What is your problem?
- Into the house.

660
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,101
- Roger, do not speak to me
that way.

661
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,608
- Now what?
What's wrong?

662
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,610
- Want some water?
- Okay.

663
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,168
- He couldn't breathe
from your meal.

664
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,577
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

665
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,444
- Oh, you are so rude.

666
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,473
You know nothing
about these sorts of things.

667
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:13,745
Do you know how many bee stings
happen up here?

668
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,345
- He... he didn't have
a bee sting, Mom!

669
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,153
- And I might need this.
- He was suffocating!

670
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,384
Theo, she wasn't gonna look
for the medicine.

671
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,449
She said that it was
too expensive to use.

672
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,757
- Roger is misrepresenting
the situation.

673
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,092
- You're joking.

674
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,122
I go inside for five minutes,

675
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,464
and my boyfriend almost dies.

676
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,732
- Theo, darling, please.
- Shh.

677
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,329
We'll talk about this later.

678
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:35,737
I don't want the kid
to find out.

679
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,538
- It's just in the middle
of this dinner

680
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,135
I've prepared for you,

681
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,202
my mind is in a thousand places.

682
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,714
- Mom, this isn't for us.

683
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,807
It's for you.

684
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,148
- That's...

685
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,347
That's not true.

686
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:51,514
It's not.

687
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,751
Malcolm, can you believe this?

688
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,159
- I think what everyone needs
to do is just calm down.

689
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,530
- [Sighs]

690
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,089
I'm gonna go back
and finish dinner.

691
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,657
I... honestly, Mom,
you're embarrassing.

692
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,766
- [Sighs]

693
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,209
Well...

694
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,442
[sighs]

695
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,485
They're boyfriends now.

696
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,816
That's nice.

697
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,514
- [Sighs]

698
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,387
Why don't you go back outside?

699
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,424
- No.

700
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:30,326
I want to have dessert
by the fire.

701
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,761
Maria.

702
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,526
But I've always wanted
to redecorate this house.

703
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,830
We... we never really decorated
in the first place.

704
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,531
Our life was much simpler
back then.

705
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,834
- Hmm.

706
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,807
- We bought some furniture
from a shop in town.

707
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,922
It was already upholstered.

708
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:48,135
Now it's six-month lead time
and custom everything.

709
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,309
You can't buy a chair
for under $10,000.

710
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,612
- Christ, Mom.

711
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,586
You sound like Veronika Goss.

712
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,520
- Decorating is the single thing

713
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,353
I have in common
with that woman,

714
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,689
though I can't stand
her ridiculous taste.

715
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,920
