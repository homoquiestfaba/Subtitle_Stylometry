Riley's stuff
just about ready, Kiernan?

224
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,312

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,670
Riley was about as solid
as they come.

Tell that to the tree
he hit doin' 120.

happen to his dog?

outside of Nogales.

She's the guest of honor.

00:12:40,424 --> 00:12:42,557
Oh, that's...
That's a genius idea.

236
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,385
I hope she doesn't
eat everybody first.

237
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:46,866
[chuckles softly] Well,
that part will be up to you.

238
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:51,261
Wait, wait, what?

- [dogs barking]
- [man shouting indistinctly]

240
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:57,180
[Jones] We sent Riley's body
off late last night.

241
00:12:57,224 --> 00:12:59,879
And his mother called this morning.
She wants his hero dog at the funeral.

242
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:02,185
Sir, are you asking me to fly
a damn dog to Arizona?

243
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,274
No, I'm asking you
to drive a Ranger to Arizona.

244
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:05,580
She refuses to fly.

245
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:08,191
Why ain't she deploying
with you?

246
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:10,411
Won't work with anyone. One minute she's good, the
next minute, she's sending three guys to the ER.

247
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:14,197
Riley kept trying after you guys got
blown up, but she's gone all the way.

248
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:17,157
Maybe Riley should have thought of that before
he broke the speed of sound into a tree.

249
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,681
- Yeah, well, Rangers find a way to die.
- Hold on, let me get this straight,

250
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:21,944
so I agree to do this,
and you're gonna call Black Canopy

251
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:25,252
- and get my packet pushed.
- You do this, and then I make the call, no screw-ups,

252
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,342
nothing gets back to me. After the service,
you drop off on base down at White Sands,

253
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:29,865
they'll handle the rest.

254
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,519
White Sands? So they're just
gonna put her down anyway.

255
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,956
There's not a handler or a PD
crazy enough to adopt her up.

256
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,567
Doesn't make us feel warm and fuzzy inside.
Just is what it is.

257
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:40,658
How about I disappear her ass, you make the call,
and we both go on with our lives? How about that?

258
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:43,618
You stick your neck out for Battalion,
I'll stick mine out for you.

259
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:45,359
- Take it or leave it.
- Sir...

260
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,537
Ready to pick up
your furry flash-bang?

261
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,799
[Briggs]
That's what I'm told, man.

262
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:52,714
[Jones]
Here's the deal, Briggs,

263
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:54,759
this isn't the same dog
you served with,

264
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:57,110
she's got every combat trigger
in the book.

265
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:58,763
So you keep her secured

266
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,026
and you don't take her out
in public.

267
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:03,768
We clear?

268
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,817
All right.

269
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,211
If anyone asks, say she's
on her way to rehabilitation.

270
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,780
Hey, do you want me
to leash her up for you?

leash you up.

00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,226
Hey, man, I forgot to tell you
not to touch her on the ears, man.

292
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,619
I left that part out.

[barking and whining]

294
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,623
[man] Hey, we weaned
her off the Prozac,

295
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,407
so she might get moody
from time to time.

296
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,105
Her muzzle can only stay on

297
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:20,932
for about two hours at a time
or she'll overheat.

298
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:22,630
Make sure you put water
in her food,

299
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,240
and as you know,
don't touch her ears.

300
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:25,633

676
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:02,569
Oh, shit. Okay. Hey, hey, hey!

677
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:03,657
Hey! No, no, no!

678
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,006
[car honking]

[Lulu barking]

680
00:31:09,054 --> 00:31:10,533
Hey! Hey!

681
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:12,144
No, no!

682
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:13,754
Hey! [grunts]

683
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:19,238
Hey, look. No, no, no, no.
Come here.

684
00:31:20,065 --> 00:31:21,370
Hey, dog!

685
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:25,592
Dog, come here. No!

686
00:31:28,682 --> 00:31:30,423
[panting]

687
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:32,599
Come here! [grunting]

688
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,695
Hey, dog!

689
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:44,872
Dog!

690
00:31:59,713 --> 00:32:02,455
[Lulu barking in distance]

[creaking]

692
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:09,636
Hey, dog!

693
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:20,299
Hey, come!

[door creaking]

695
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,959
Oh, shit.

696
00:32:29,003 --> 00:32:32,050
No, no, no, no, no. Dog, we're
not supposed to be in here.

697
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:32,833
Let's go.

698
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:38,056
Hello?

699
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:41,929
[door creaks]

700
00:32:44,192 --> 00:32:45,063
[Briggs] Hello?

701
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:52,070
Come!

702
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,247
Dog?

703
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,770
- Come on. [grunts]
- [dart fires]

704
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,381

00:33:04,386 --> 00:33:05,387
Hey!

707

- [high-pitched ringing]
- [breathing heavily]

708

[pig grunting]

709
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:37,332
Oh, shit. You've gotta
be kidding me.

710
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,119
Dog!

711
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:43,512

[breathing heavily]

713
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:49,301
- Hey, dog!
- [pig grunting]

714
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:50,215
[Briggs] Hello?

715
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:55,307
Hello!

716
00:33:58,223 --> 00:33:59,006
[man] Hey, big fella.

717
00:34:02,401 --> 00:34:04,664
Hey, what did you hit me with, man?
Horse tranq?

718
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,188
This is pretty good.

719
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,320
[man] Time for you
to start squealing.

720
00:34:09,582 --> 00:34:11,018
Hey, have you seen a dog?

721
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:13,194
She's brown, she's, like,
running around,

722
00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:15,414
I don't know,
with crazy eyes, huh?

723
00:34:17,111 --> 00:34:18,460
[man] Tell me who you work for.

724
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:20,114
[Briggs] Okay, look,

725
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,986
[sighs] I'm obviously not
who you think I am.

726
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,640
[man] I know
who the hell you are.

727
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,993
Think you're the first
commando they sent up here?

728
00:34:30,037 --> 00:34:30,951
Take my strains?

729
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:35,999
Look, old man, unless
you're willing to walk this

730
00:34:36,043 --> 00:34:37,175
till the end of the road,

731
00:34:37,218 --> 00:34:38,654
I highly suggest
you cut me loose

732
00:34:38,698 --> 00:34:40,265
and let me go find
my damn dog.

733
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:42,223
[man] You got five minutes
to clear your head,

734
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:43,181
or you can join her ass.

735
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:45,792
[grunts and groans]

736
00:34:46,923 --> 00:34:48,708

00:35:01,242 --> 00:35:03,679
[groans and pants]

739
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:15,387

[pig grunting]

741
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:25,440
[clatters]

742
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,626
Hell, yeah.

743
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:52,250
[man speaking indistinctly]

744
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:54,034
Who the hell you think
you're talking to?

745
00:35:55,557 --> 00:35:56,863
We'll see about that.

746
00:35:58,691 --> 00:35:59,692
Bitch!

747
00:36:03,565 --> 00:36:04,871
[operatic music playing softly
on speakers]

748
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:34,988
[man mumbling indistinctly]

749
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,950
Oh, that is...
That's bullshit.

750
00:36:42,212 --> 00:36:43,518
[man speaking indistinctly]

751
00:36:43,562 --> 00:36:46,216
[softly] Dog, come here,
come here.

752
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,783
- [Lulu panting]
- [whispers] Now! Come here!

753
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:49,307
Come here!

754
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:55,138
[woman] Gus, is he awake yet?

755
00:36:55,182 --> 00:36:56,749
[Gus] Wide awake.
He's zip-tied in the barn.

756
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:58,185
[woman] Zip-tied? Oh, my God.

757
00:36:58,228 --> 00:36:59,969
What the hell
did you do to him?

758
00:37:00,013 --> 00:37:02,145
[Gus] Some shit.
I told him I killed his dog.

759
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:03,930
[woman] Gus, what do you know
about interrogation?

760
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,584
You were
a conscientious objector.

761
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:07,412
[Gus] How about a little
damn appreciation?

762
00:37:07,455 --> 00:37:10,197
[woman] I told you not to hit
those edibles so hard.

763
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,373
Cartel? You paranoid maniac.

764
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:13,896
- Tell him you're...
- [Gus] You're crazy, I'm not...

765
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,942
...a scared old fool
who needs heavy therapy.

766
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,291
Just tell him you're sorry.

767
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,075
[Gus] I shot him
with a tranquilizer.

768
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,947
[woman] I don't care what you did.
[Gus] I pushed him...

769
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,514
- [woman] Now you're making me upset this little nugget.
- [panting]

770
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,430
This perfect noodle...
[mumbling]

771
00:37:25,473 --> 00:37:27,432
[Gus] Listen, let's get
the hell out of here.

772
00:37:27,475 --> 00:37:29,608
[woman] 'Cause I wanna look
at your little, little paw.

773
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:31,218
You're so good.

774
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:32,524
So good.

775
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:33,960
- So good.
- [Lulu grunts softly]

776
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,135
[woman] What a little nugget.

777
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,705
- [woman] Honey...
- Look, Jesus, I...

778
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:40,706
[Briggs] Shut up.

779
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,403
Sit down.

780
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:47,408
Uh...

781
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,240
How'd you make her
eat out of your hand?

782
00:37:53,762 --> 00:37:54,981
[Lulu whining]

783
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:58,419
I didn't make her
do anything.

784
00:37:58,463 --> 00:37:59,202
I just talked to her.

785
00:38:00,465 --> 00:38:02,380
By the way, you can do
anything you like

786
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:03,772
with my idiot husband.

787
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,819
Gus, apologize.

788
00:38:08,255 --> 00:38:10,779
[hesitates] Sorry, dude.
My bad, my bad.

789
00:38:17,525 --> 00:38:20,049
[Lulu whining and panting]

790
00:38:20,093 --> 00:38:21,877
[woman] Hmm, see,
she's just a noodle.

791
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:23,531
She just needs some good...

792
00:38:23,575 --> 00:38:25,446
I'm just going to touch her
little, little paw.

793
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,448
Is she gonna be okay?

794
00:38:27,492 --> 00:38:29,668
Well, I'm worried she may
have broken her foot,

795
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:32,061
but I'm gonna try my best.

796
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:34,194
You need to give, um...
What is her name?

797
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:35,238
Lulu.

798
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:36,762
Lulu and I some space.

799
00:38:36,805 --> 00:38:38,503
So, um, here.

800
00:38:38,546 --> 00:38:40,679
Come on.
Gus, make yourself useful

801
00:38:40,722 --> 00:38:42,594
and get this man
some clean clothes

802
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:44,857
because he's really
smelling strongly

803
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,467
of Boris and his friends.

804
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:48,687
So here, take some
homemade edibles.

805
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,906
Go make friends, okay?

806
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:55,868
Guys, come on, stop it.
Get outside.

807
00:38:55,911 --> 00:38:57,217
[Gus] You can't tell me that

808
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,088
you did this
with a damn shoestring.

809
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:00,307
[Briggs] You just gotta
compromise the plastic.

810
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,613
That's it. [chuckles]

811
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:04,311
Listen, I'm a lot better
at permaculture

812
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:05,486
than I am tying dudes up.

813
00:39:06,705 --> 00:39:09,664
I need to know, man,
how close was I to...

814
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,884
- Dying?
- Yeah.

815
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:14,103
Pretty... Pretty close, actually. I almost
put an axe in the back of your head.

816
00:39:14,147 --> 00:39:15,627
[sighs]

817
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,977
[hesitates] This is...
Well done.

818
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,500
- Yeah, right? Right?
- Hmm.

819
00:39:19,544 --> 00:39:22,111
I'm just glad
you love that dog so much.

820
00:39:22,155 --> 00:39:24,331
I don't love that dog.
It's not even my dog.

821
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:25,941
Come on, get on your back.

822
00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:27,290
Get on your back,
you can do it.

823
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:28,901
- Come on.
- [Gus] Whose damn dog

824
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:29,684
- Is it?
- [zip tie snaps]

825
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:33,471
[both cheering]

826
00:39:33,514 --> 00:39:34,646
[Briggs] Look, you see that?

827
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:37,475
- You see this?
- [Gus] Yeah.

828
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:39,172
[Briggs] This is how they teach them to attract the enemy.
They can smell their clothes from, like, a mile off.

829
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:42,915
Is this two dead dudes?

830
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,394
[Briggs laughs]

831
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:45,961
Yeah. Those are...
That's two Taliban,

832
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:48,181
uh, dope farmers right there.

833
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,748
Oh, don't look
all shocked, man.

834
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:51,358
It's war.
It's not all unicorns

835
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:53,142
and rainbow vaginas
out there, right?

836
00:39:53,795 --> 00:39:56,102
Yeah, I bet.

837
00:39:56,145 --> 00:40:00,236
So why do they call it
I Love Me book?

838
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,021
I don't know.
Uh, but in the army,

839
00:40:02,064 --> 00:40:03,762
they just,
they make us all keep one.

840
00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:06,329
They make us put every single,
last stupid detail in.

841
00:40:08,984 --> 00:40:11,770
So, Lulu's greatest hits.
This is like...

842
00:40:11,813 --> 00:40:13,685
Like her music.
Like, music she...

843
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:16,470
No, no, no, no, no.
It's the other greatest hits,

844
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,167
you know.

845
00:40:18,211 --> 00:40:20,300
[chuckles] Like,
it's her bodycam footage.

846
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:21,780
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah.

847
00:40:21,823 --> 00:40:22,650
It's the...
[imitates gunshots] kinda...

848
00:40:22,694 --> 00:40:24,565
Yeah, I'll pass.

849
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:25,958
So let me get this right, man.

850
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:28,787
So, like, the dog

Come here. Come on. Let's go.

1024
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,250
Let's go. Come here.

1025
00:47:29,294 --> 00:47:32,166
Come, come, come here.
Get in the tub.

1026
00:47:33,254 --> 00:47:34,255
Come on, come on.

1027
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:36,431
Okay.

1028
00:47:40,783 --> 00:47:42,785
[in a soft voice]
You good little nugget.

1029
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,571
Such a good little nugget.

1030
00:47:46,398 --> 00:47:48,487
Come on, little nugget.

1031
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:51,359
Come on,
now get in the nugget bath.

1032
00:47:51,403 --> 00:47:52,578
Good girl, come on.

1033
00:47:53,361 --> 00:47:55,624
Come on. You're okay.

1034
00:47:55,668 --> 00:47:57,626
- I'll dip you like a nugget.
- [whines]

1035
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,673
I don't want to kill you.
Mmm-mmm.

1036
00:48:00,716 --> 00:48:03,023
- Yeah, good girl. Good girl.
- [whines]

1037
00:48:03,067 --> 00:48:04,677
Good girl. Come on. Come on.

1038
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,809
Come on, yeah! Get in.
Come on, come on.

1039
00:48:06,853 --> 00:48:08,159
- [barking]
- No, no, no, come here.

1040
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:09,421
Come here, come here,
come here.

1041
00:48:09,464 --> 00:48:11,031
- [barks]
- It's all nice and warm.

1042
00:48:11,075 --> 00:48:13,599
It's all nice and warm.
Yes, it is.

1043
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:15,209
Yes, it is!

1044
00:48:15,253 --> 00:48:20,214
We went through four
bath bombs, bath salts.

1045
00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:22,347
Should I call down to the spa
and get us a slot down there

1046
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,610
for a doggy massage? Yeah?

1047
00:48:26,264 --> 00:48:27,700
You're definitely not the girl

1048
00:48:27,743 --> 00:48:29,615
I thought I'd be
in the tub with, but, hey,

1049
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,400
you know,
I'll take what I can get

1050
00:48:32,444 --> 00:48:34,011
at this point, I guess.

1051
00:48:34,054 --> 00:48:35,577
All right.

1052
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,449
Last bit, all right?

1053
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:39,494
There we go.

1054
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,238
- [doorbell rings]
- One second. One Minute.

1055
00:48:44,282 --> 00:48:45,109
Hold on, I'm coming.

1056
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,634
Yes, one second.

1057
00:48:50,244 --> 00:48:53,247
Um, one second, yes.

1058
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,510
Coming.

1059
00:48:55,554 --> 00:48:57,295
Good evening, sir.
Here with the room service.

1060
00:48:57,338 --> 00:48:58,861
- Good evening.
- Oh, good evening.

1061
00:48:58,905 --> 00:49:00,124
- May I come in, please?
- Yes, please.

1062
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:01,473
All right.
I can take the door.

1063
00:49:01,516 --> 00:49:04,345
So we have one rib eye,
medium rare,

1064
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:06,043
and one Indian samosas.

1065
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:07,522
- Anything else?
- No.

1066
00:49:07,566 --> 00:49:09,089
- Everything looks shipshape.
- All right.

1067
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:10,656
- Thank you very much.
- Have a good evening.

1068
00:49:12,353 --> 00:49:13,615
[door closes]

1069
00:49:14,094 --> 00:49:15,965
[laughing]

1070
00:49:17,184 --> 00:49:20,100
Hey, dog, you should
see this guy's face.

1071
00:49:20,144 --> 00:49:22,233
[laughs] Hey! No!

1072
00:49:22,276 --> 00:49:23,756
Get off! Get off there!

1073
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:25,105
Don't do it! Stop!

1074
00:49:25,149 --> 00:49:27,107
No! No! You...

1075
00:49:27,151 --> 00:49:29,805
Okay. You know what?
I didn't even care anyways.

1076
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:30,937
That was your bed.
'Cause I'm going out.

1077
00:49:31,372 --> 00:49:33,592
[whining]

1078
00:49:34,636 --> 00:49:37,074
[TV playing indistinctly]

1079
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:48,172
Do I look like 200k a year
or what?

1080
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:51,349
Look at you, sitting on
the couch, looking all cute.

1081
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:53,655
Why didn't you tell me
all I had to do was just

1082
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,484
turn on the TV and put your greatest hits on
of you mauling people, to get you to relax?

1083
00:49:57,442 --> 00:49:59,139
[chuckles] You narcissist.

1084
00:49:59,183 --> 00:50:01,620
What happened, no go
on the Indian food?

1085
00:50:01,663 --> 00:50:02,664
I told you,
you can't trust psychics.

1086
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:05,406
But don't you worry.

1087
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,539
I got exactly what you want.

1088
00:50:07,582 --> 00:50:11,108
Dry-aged, marbled-on-the-bone
beautifulness. Ready?

1089
00:50:12,935 --> 00:50:14,720
Take it, savor it. Come on.

1090
00:50:16,548 --> 00:50:18,332
You don't have to be scared.
Just take it out of my hand.

1091
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:21,292
Whatever.

1092
00:50:26,558 --> 00:50:28,734
Do not do anything stupid.

1093
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:36,437
[growling softly]

1094
00:50:38,787 --> 00:50:40,006
What?

1095
00:50:40,049 --> 00:50:41,834
- [whining]
- Hell, no.

1096
00:50:41,877 --> 00:50:43,357
Oh, you think you're
coming with me?

1097
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:44,837
Do you think I forgot
about Portland?

1098
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,447
- [barks]
- No.

1099
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:47,622
I'll never forget
about Portland.

1100
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:49,363
- Ever.
- [barking]

1101
00:50:49,407 --> 00:50:50,756
Go lay back down.

1102
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:52,192
[barking]

1103
00:50:52,236 --> 00:50:53,454
You asked for the bed,

1104
00:50:53,498 --> 00:50:54,760
I got you the bed.
Go lay down.

1105
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:56,065
- [door closes]
- [whining]

1106
00:50:57,632 --> 00:51:00,766
- Hey, no, no!
- [Lulu barking]

1107
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:05,771
- [barking]
- Hey, dog, no!

1108
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,259
[Lulu barking and scratching]

1109
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:17,957
[objects clattering]

1110
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,437
[muzak playing]

1111
00:51:21,482 --> 00:51:23,789
You're a first-class moron,
you know that?

1112
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:42,286
[Lulu sniffing]

1113
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:44,505
You smell that, girl? Money.

1114
00:51:46,028 --> 00:51:47,726
Congratulations, by the way.

1115
00:51:48,466 --> 00:51:49,597
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1116
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:51,208
[indistinct chatter]

1117
00:51:56,778 --> 00:51:59,041
[woman speaking indistinctly]

1118
00:51:59,085 --> 00:52:01,087
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- Oh, sir, pardon me.

1119
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,872
- [Briggs] I'm... You okay?
- Yes, Mr. Briggs.

1120
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:05,700
- Of course, yeah.
- Wait, I know that voice.

1121
00:52:05,744 --> 00:52:08,486
- Wait. Who's that?
- Oh, we met at the front desk.

1122
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:10,096
- [Briggs] Oh, the... Yes.
- Callan.

1123
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:11,619
[Briggs] Yes, Callan,
the front desk angel.

1124
00:52:11,663 --> 00:52:13,230
I'm looking for a place
to eat tonight.

1125
00:52:13,273 --> 00:52:14,883
- Oh, there are...
- Any good recommendations?

1126
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:16,537
[Callan] Yes, there's
a fantastic oyster bar

1127
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:17,451
down at the Embarcadero.

1128
00:52:17,495 --> 00:52:19,018
[Briggs] I love oysters.

1129
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:20,411
They really, you know,
heighten the senses.

1130
00:52:20,454 --> 00:52:21,542
- What time do you get off?
- [Lulu growling softly]

1131
00:52:21,586 --> 00:52:23,065
Uh, I'm off at 7:00.

1132
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:24,458
- 7:00? What time is it now?
- [Lulu barking]

1133
00:52:24,502 --> 00:52:27,113
Oh, no, no. No, no, no! Dog!

- Watch out, watch out.
- [women screaming]

1137
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:36,427

- [people screaming]
- Dog, dog, no, no, no! Move!

1139
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:42,476
No, no! No, no, no, no!

1140
00:52:44,696 --> 00:52:46,175
- [Briggs] Get off!
- [man groaning]

1141
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:46,915
[Briggs] Get off.

1142
00:52:47,742 --> 00:52:49,570
- [Lulu whining]
- No!

1143
00:52:49,614 --> 00:52:51,746
[man groaning] [Callan] Oh my god,
take your time, take your time.

1144
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:52,921
Are you okay?

1145
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:54,358
[Callan] Somebody get a doctor.

1146
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:56,882
- I'm so sorry.
- [Lulu whining and barking]

1147
00:52:59,972 --> 00:53:01,974
No!

1148
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:03,802
[Callan] You all right?
Take it easy, take it easy.

1149
00:53:03,845 --> 00:53:05,891
Okay. Here we go, here we go.

1150
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,897
Oh, my God, I can...
I can see.

1151
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,205
I can see. Guys, I can see!

1152
00:53:16,249 --> 00:53:17,685
[indistinct chatter]

1153
00:53:20,732 --> 00:53:24,344
Hey, hey! Hey!

1154
00:53:24,388 --> 00:53:27,173
[officer] So you were
impersonating a blind man

1155
00:53:27,216 --> 00:53:30,132
as part of a seeing eye
dog training exercise?

1156
00:53:30,176 --> 00:53:32,047
- [Briggs] Yep, that's right.
- Mmm-hmm.

1157
00:53:32,091 --> 00:53:35,573
When suddenly, uh,
unbeknownst to you,

1158
00:53:35,616 --> 00:53:38,227
um, your dog broke free
from your grasp,

1159
00:53:38,271 --> 00:53:40,099
sprinted the entire length
of the lobby

1160
00:53:40,142 --> 00:53:42,362
- and muzzle struck the victim?
- Correct.

1161
00:53:42,406 --> 00:53:43,972
[officer] And you've never
seen this dog exhibit

1162
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:45,757
any type of aggressive
behavior before this?

1163
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,716
Never. Never. She usually...
She loves people.

1164
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,197
It's out of her character.
I really don't understand it.

1165
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,025
- Man, honestly, I'm in shock.
- [clicks tongue] Uh-huh.

1166
00:53:55,114 --> 00:53:56,420
Is there anything else
you want to add?

1167
00:53:56,463 --> 00:53:57,725
How is the guy?
Is he all right?

1168
00:53:57,769 --> 00:53:59,161
- Yeah.
- He seemed okay.

1169
00:53:59,205 --> 00:54:00,424
Well, we're gonna
be contacting

1170
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:03,035
Dr. Al-Farid in the morning.

1171
00:54:03,078 --> 00:54:05,385
He wants to press charges.
We'll take it from there.

1172
00:54:05,429 --> 00:54:08,257
Until then,
you just sit tight.

1173
00:54:08,301 --> 00:54:10,172
[Briggs] Cool, and the dog?
Dog's okay?

1174
00:54:10,216 --> 00:54:11,478
[officer] We're gonna
have to check

1175
00:54:11,522 --> 00:54:13,001
with animal control
on that one.

1176
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:14,394
[Briggs] Okay.
So when do I get her back?

1177
00:54:14,438 --> 00:54:16,265
Do I have to post bail
or whatever?

1178
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:19,051
[officer] Post bail?
Buddy, it is Friday night.

1179
00:54:19,094 --> 00:54:21,532
Judge is not back
until Monday A.M.

1180
00:54:21,575 --> 00:54:25,231
And I am required
to keep all suspects

1181
00:54:25,274 --> 00:54:26,972
in possible hate crimes
in my custody.

1182
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:28,626
Hate crime?

1183
00:54:28,669 --> 00:54:30,367
Now, don't start with me.
Take it to City Hall.

1184
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,064
Who said anything about a hate
crime? Wait, wait, wait.

1185
00:54:32,107 --> 00:54:33,892
Hold on a second. Okay.
All right. Let me... Let me...

1186
00:54:33,935 --> 00:54:34,893
Let me level with you, man.

1187
00:54:36,198 --> 00:54:37,591
Okay? I was an Army Ranger.

1188
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,029
That dog's handler was

funeral in Arizona on Sunday.

1190

1191

1192
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:49,429
All right?
Now I'll be back here

1193
00:54:49,473 --> 00:54:50,996

1195

I gotta tell you something.

1203

And I gotta level with you.

and those glasses, man.

1206
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:16,674
You Army Rangers,

1207
00:55:16,717 --> 00:55:18,371
you've got balls of steel.

1208
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:19,981

- I'm a huge fan, seriously.

1209

Hey, I gotta ask you something,
on the real, on the real.

they took from us, right?

- No. I... No,

1214

- Come on. Don't worry, man.

at the guardhouse,

like Dr. Al-Farid.

1272

01:09:03,064 --> 01:09:04,414
my migraine meds right now.

1525
01:09:05,328 --> 01:09:07,417
[dogs barking]

1526
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,114
Yeah, most of
Riley's shit's here.

1527
01:09:09,157 --> 01:09:10,289
Her book's here.

1528
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:14,815
Hey, what is this shit, man?
This is private property.

1529
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,513
- Oh, is it? That's yours?
- Yeah.

1530
01:09:16,556 --> 01:09:18,428
- All right, Jackson, let's go.
- Your name's Rodriguez?

1531
01:09:18,471 --> 01:09:20,517
Man, I'm a United States
army veteran, man.

1532
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,301
Yeah? Take it off right now.

1533
01:09:22,345 --> 01:09:23,781
- I ain't taking off shit.
- What battalion were you in?

1534
01:09:24,477 --> 01:09:25,826
That's classified.

1535
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,741
[groaning and screaming]

1536
01:09:27,785 --> 01:09:30,701
[Briggs] Get it off!
Get it off!

1537
01:09:30,744 --> 01:09:34,661
[thief continues screaming]
Oh, goddamn, man.

1538
01:09:34,705 --> 01:09:37,055
Hey, I serve my country,

1539
01:09:37,098 --> 01:09:38,665
and this is the thanks I get?

1540
01:09:38,709 --> 01:09:39,971
I'm a war hero!

1541
01:09:40,014 --> 01:09:41,755
[man] Get the fuck
outta here, man!

1542
01:09:41,799 --> 01:09:43,366
[Noah] You're gonna be
all good without those meds?

1543
01:09:43,409 --> 01:09:44,802
[Briggs] I should have
just let her eat

1544
01:09:44,845 --> 01:09:46,673
that stolen valor
piece of shit.

1545
01:09:46,717 --> 01:09:48,893
[Noah] You never know in places
like that who served.

1546
01:09:50,024 --> 01:09:51,722
And if you were here
five years ago,

1547
01:09:51,765 --> 01:09:53,593
you could have caught my ass
under that pier,

1548
01:09:53,637 --> 01:09:55,987
and that would have been
the best-case scenario.

1549
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:57,902
[Briggs] Yeah, but I didn't.

1550
01:09:57,945 --> 01:09:59,295
'Cause that bullshit ain't us.

1551
01:09:59,338 --> 01:10:00,339
Yeah?

1552
01:10:00,383 --> 01:10:01,340
What about Riley?

1553
01:10:02,254 --> 01:10:04,038
What about Riley?

1554
01:10:04,082 --> 01:10:06,171
I mean, the dude couldn't get out
of bed without popping three percs.

1555
01:10:07,433 --> 01:10:08,913
Well, that's just
the breakfast of champions,

1556
01:10:08,956 --> 01:10:10,697
and he was a champion.

1557
01:10:10,741 --> 01:10:13,178
I can't tell you how many
times he called me up,

1558
01:10:13,221 --> 01:10:14,832
we'd get shitfaced
talking about

1559
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:16,529
how we were gonna check out.

1560
01:10:16,573 --> 01:10:19,010
Look, man, we all
deal with shit

1561
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:20,838
to stay in the game, okay?

1562
01:10:20,881 --> 01:10:22,230
So we're supposed
to stay in it forever?

1563
01:10:23,493 --> 01:10:25,016
He used to talk
about driving off

1564
01:10:25,059 --> 01:10:26,931
the Grand Canyon at top speed,

1565
01:10:26,974 --> 01:10:29,412
but he drove himself
into a tree instead.

1566
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:35,853
I tried to get him to talk.

1567
01:10:37,028 --> 01:10:38,725
Talk, like what,
to a therapist?

1568
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:40,336
That was a great idea.

1569
01:10:40,379 --> 01:10:42,120
No, to other guys
who have gone through it,

1570
01:10:42,163 --> 01:10:43,164
or even just to God.

1571
01:10:43,991 --> 01:10:45,558
God?

1572
01:10:45,602 --> 01:10:47,778
Okay, you didn't know shit
about Riley, all right?

1573
01:10:47,821 --> 01:10:49,780
Look, by God, I mean anything.

1574
01:10:49,823 --> 01:10:51,259
Could be a rock,
could be a shoe,

1575
01:10:51,303 --> 01:10:53,218
could be his damn barber.

1576
01:10:53,261 --> 01:10:56,003
But we all got to pick
something at some point.

1577
01:10:56,656 --> 01:10:57,657
[Briggs] Well...

1578
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:03,881
he didn't, and he won't.

1579
01:11:05,709 --> 01:11:07,841
So ain't no use
bitching about it.

1580
01:11:07,885 --> 01:11:09,582
[Noah] You know, we trained
to put the whole world

1581
01:11:09,626 --> 01:11:11,062
on our back.

1582
01:11:11,105 --> 01:11:12,759
At the end of the day,

1583
01:11:12,803 --> 01:11:14,239
the hardest thing was knocking
on a friend's door.

1584
01:11:17,068 --> 01:11:18,156
Bye, Lulu.

1585
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:20,158
Say hi to your daddy for me.

1586
01:11:20,201 --> 01:11:21,464
[panting and whining]

1587
01:11:21,507 --> 01:11:23,466
I'll be praying for you guys.

1588
01:11:23,509 --> 01:11:24,989
[Briggs] We're gonna
be just fine.

1589
01:11:26,338 --> 01:11:27,818
Come here.

1590
01:11:27,861 --> 01:11:28,993
- [Noah] Hello, guys.
- [indistinct chatter]

1591
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,267
[rainfall pattering]

1592
01:12:08,772 --> 01:12:10,164
I hope you're ready
for this tomorrow,

1593
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:12,253
because you know
what they want, right?

1594
01:12:13,907 --> 01:12:18,738
They want the hero war dog
all sad and stoic,

1595
01:12:18,782 --> 01:12:21,306
just missing her
hero war daddy.

1596
01:12:23,874 --> 01:12:25,528
What they definitely
don't want...

1597
01:12:25,571 --> 01:12:27,660
They definitely don't want you
trying to eat everybody

1598
01:12:27,704 --> 01:12:30,054
as soon as the color guard
starts firing their salute.

1599
01:12:32,752 --> 01:12:34,058
Now, they...
They don't know you.

1600
01:12:34,928 --> 01:12:36,495
That's for damn sure.

1601
01:12:38,323 --> 01:12:40,064
They don't know
what it takes to be a hero.

1602
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:44,068
The things you've done
to be a hero dog.

1603
01:12:45,548 --> 01:12:46,549
If they knew the truth,

1604
01:12:47,941 --> 01:12:51,641
it would scare the living shit
out of them.

1605
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,169
You know, when I got out,

1606
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:00,301
your daddy gave me
this shitty piece of plywood

1607
01:13:00,345 --> 01:13:02,478
with the word "Thanks"
carved in it. [chuckles]

1608
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:07,134
It's like, what else
do you say to somebody

1609
01:13:07,178 --> 01:13:09,876
that you experience
what we experienced together?

1610
01:13:12,749 --> 01:13:13,750
You even listening to me?

1611
01:13:15,752 --> 01:13:17,667
Just talking to a dog.

1612
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:20,104
- [screeching]
- [Lulu whining]

1613
01:13:21,932 --> 01:13:23,194
What is that?

1614
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:24,369
No. No, no.

1615
01:13:26,327 --> 01:13:27,111
No, no. Come on.

1616
01:13:28,329 --> 01:13:29,505
Don't you do this to me now.

1617
01:13:36,599 --> 01:13:37,556
No.

1618
01:13:39,776 --> 01:13:41,342
Ow. [grunts]

1619
01:13:44,432 --> 01:13:45,216
[groans]

1620
01:13:47,044 --> 01:13:48,698
- Okay...
- [whines]

1621
01:13:48,741 --> 01:13:50,308
Of course, there's no service.

1622
01:13:50,351 --> 01:13:51,439
Why would we have service?

1623
01:13:53,616 --> 01:13:54,399
[growls softly]

1624
01:14:22,601 --> 01:14:23,341
Hey, hey, hey.

1625
01:14:26,866 --> 01:14:27,867
Hello?

1626
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:32,568
Hey.

1627
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,105
Come on.

1628
01:14:51,456 --> 01:14:53,589
All right, we got to go.

1629
01:14:53,632 --> 01:14:55,503
- Come on. We're moving on.
- [thunder rumbling]

1630
01:14:55,547 --> 01:14:56,853
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- [Lulu barking]

1631
01:14:56,896 --> 01:14:58,942
Hey, hey, no.

1632
01:14:58,985 --> 01:15:00,857
No. Chill out.

1633
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:04,295
- [barking continues]
- Hey. Hey, hey!

1634
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:06,210
No! Stop! Relax!

1635
01:15:06,253 --> 01:15:08,647
Look, stop. It's just thunder.

1636
01:15:08,691 --> 01:15:10,997
It's just a thunderstorm.
We gotta... Stop.

1637
01:15:11,868 --> 01:15:13,434
- Calm down. Stop!
- [growls]

1638
01:15:13,478 --> 01:15:15,045
Hey!

1639
01:15:15,088 --> 01:15:17,090
All right, you want to go?
Come on. Come on, then.

1640
01:15:17,134 --> 01:15:19,049
Come on,
you're not gonna do shit.

1641
01:15:20,311 --> 01:15:21,529
Come on, then, let's go!

1642
01:15:22,705 --> 01:15:25,664
[barks, growling]

1643
01:15:25,708 --> 01:15:27,405
[panting]

1644
01:15:31,757 --> 01:15:32,540
Such a coward.

1645
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,548
[barking]

1646
01:15:52,735 --> 01:15:55,041
[thunder rumbling]

1647
01:16:02,483 --> 01:16:04,964
[soft music playing]

1648
01:16:34,777 --> 01:16:37,344
Easy. I'm not gonna make you
go out there, okay?

1649
01:16:37,388 --> 01:16:39,346
How about we just chill out
for a little while?

1650
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:40,608
Relax.

1651
01:16:40,652 --> 01:16:41,871
- [thunder rumbles]
- [whines]

1652
01:16:41,914 --> 01:16:43,524
Hey, it's okay.

1653
01:16:43,568 --> 01:16:45,091
It's just thunder
and a little lightning.

1654
01:16:46,789 --> 01:16:49,574
You know what? How about this?
Let me see if I can

1655
01:16:49,617 --> 01:16:52,229
give us a little something
to take our mind off.

1656
01:16:52,272 --> 01:16:54,579
Cross your paws.
Let's see if this thing works.

1657
01:16:54,622 --> 01:16:55,493
What do you feel like?

1658
01:16:57,147 --> 01:16:58,583
Who doesn't like
San Francisco?

1659
01:16:58,626 --> 01:17:00,150
You want to watch
your greatest hits,

1660
01:17:00,193 --> 01:17:01,586
or do you wanna watch...
Wanna watch Grey's?

1661
01:17:01,629 --> 01:17:02,805
I'm gonna go with Grey's.

1662
01:17:06,025 --> 01:17:07,635
[laughs] It works.

1663
01:17:11,639 --> 01:17:12,945
We're just gonna rest,

1664
01:17:12,989 --> 01:17:15,208
we're gonna get
a little cozy, relax.

1665
01:17:16,775 --> 01:17:17,820
[TV playing indistinctly]

1666
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,345
Watch a little trash TV.

1667
01:17:23,303 --> 01:17:25,784
A little snack 'cause
you can't watch trash TV

1668
01:17:25,828 --> 01:17:26,611
without a snack.

1669
01:17:29,222 --> 01:17:30,223
[thunder rumbling]

1670
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:32,530
What?

1671
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:34,750
Oh, you want some?

1672
01:17:42,235 --> 01:17:44,020
[laughs] Look at that.

1673
01:17:45,935 --> 01:17:48,459
Who knew you just needed
to have a fight to get along?

1674
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:54,595
Did Latin Shakespeare ever,

1675
01:17:54,639 --> 01:17:56,380
like, read you
his love letters?

1676
01:17:59,078 --> 01:18:00,253
Some pretty good ones
in there.

1677
01:18:03,517 --> 01:18:04,388
Let's see.

1678
01:18:08,218 --> 01:18:09,306
What about...

1679
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:12,788
Okay. [chuckles]

1680
01:18:15,529 --> 01:18:20,796
"I woke for an instant when
I saw you covered in dirt.

1681
01:18:23,624 --> 01:18:24,974
You've taken bullets before.

1682
01:18:26,323 --> 01:18:27,585
This was the worst.

1683
01:18:30,109 --> 01:18:31,415
The guilt still haunts me.

1684
01:18:33,069 --> 01:18:35,071
I'm not going to lie,

1685
01:18:35,114 --> 01:18:37,551
but I know you did
what you did that night,

1686
01:18:37,595 --> 01:18:39,640
so none of your brothers
had to die."

1687
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,599
It's pretty good.

1688
01:18:44,689 --> 01:18:46,125
"When they took you away,

1689
01:18:46,169 --> 01:18:48,867
I was sure
we'd run out of time

1690
01:18:50,913 --> 01:18:52,349
and that's when
it hit me, girl,

1691
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,614
I was never your handler.

1692
01:18:59,312 --> 01:19:01,314
That you were actually mine.

1693
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:06,537
Your brother, Riley."

1694
01:19:09,148 --> 01:19:10,280
You slept with Corrine?

1695
01:19:11,368 --> 01:19:13,022
Yeah.

1696
01:19:13,065 --> 01:19:14,850

01:31:55,131 --> 01:31:56,611
uh, to a Corporal Levitz.

1869
01:31:57,437 --> 01:31:58,438
Hey, Levitz!

1870
01:31:59,657 --> 01:32:00,702
Do me a favor,
park right here.

1871
01:32:00,745 --> 01:32:01,528
[Briggs] Yeah.

1872
01:32:13,976 --> 01:32:16,108
Shit, man. You Rangers
ever hear of callin'?

1873
01:32:16,152 --> 01:32:18,415
I've been out here cooking
my ass off for an hour.

1874
01:32:19,459 --> 01:32:20,286
It could be worse.

1875
01:32:21,374 --> 01:32:23,072
You could be actually working.

1876
01:32:23,115 --> 01:32:24,726
[Levitz] All right, man.
I hear she's a real killer,

1877
01:32:24,769 --> 01:32:26,075
so just make sure
you muzzle her up good, okay?

1878
01:32:26,118 --> 01:32:27,119
[Briggs] Yeah.

1879
01:32:28,904 --> 01:32:30,296
Don't worry.

1880
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:31,907
She ain't gonna be a problem.

1881
01:32:32,559 --> 01:32:33,430
Are you, girl?

1882
01:32:34,736 --> 01:32:37,913
Last time, okay? Last time.

1883
01:32:37,956 --> 01:32:39,697
Just gonna put it on
one more time.

1884
01:32:39,741 --> 01:32:41,960
[Lulu whining]

1885
01:32:42,004 --> 01:32:44,093
Hey, man,
she's been doing a lot better.

1886
01:32:44,136 --> 01:32:48,401
So just make sure the vet techs, you
know, reevaluate her, give her a chance.

1887
01:32:48,445 --> 01:32:49,664
[Levitz] Yeah, yeah,
they got their protocol.

1888
01:32:51,491 --> 01:32:52,667
You heard me. Make sure.

1889
01:32:54,581 --> 01:32:57,062
So as soon as we're done here,
you're gonna call Captain Jones, yeah?

1890
01:32:57,106 --> 01:32:59,891
- That's what they're telling me.
- What are you... Look, man, are you trying to piss her off?

[sighs deeply]

1893
01:33:05,984 --> 01:33:09,422
All right. You're gonna
be okay, all right?

1894
01:33:09,466 --> 01:33:11,033
[Levitz] Come on, man,
I ain't got all day, let's go.

1895
01:33:11,076 --> 01:33:12,382
[Briggs] I'm just gonna
put this on you.

1896
01:33:14,993 --> 01:33:15,994
[Lulu whining softly]

1897
01:33:19,215 --> 01:33:20,956
[whispers] Give 'em hell.

1898
01:33:20,999 --> 01:33:22,000
All right, let's go.

[Lulu barking in distance]

1902
01:33:51,203 --> 01:33:52,639
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.

1903
01:33:53,945 --> 01:33:55,338
- [Lulu barking]
- [Briggs] Come on.

1906
01:34:10,614 --> 01:34:12,747
God. Easy, easy, easy, easy.

[tires screech]

1909
01:34:24,106 --> 01:34:25,629
[Briggs] Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1910
01:34:25,672 --> 01:34:27,370
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1911
01:34:27,413 --> 01:34:29,285
Hi, hi, hi.
No. It's fine. It's fine.

1912
01:34:29,328 --> 01:34:32,288
My bad. I should have... You know
what, I should have put a vest on her.

1913
01:34:32,331 --> 01:34:34,203
She listens more
when the vest is on.

1914
01:34:34,246 --> 01:34:36,031
You know girls
and their fashion. [chuckles]

1915
01:34:36,074 --> 01:34:37,380
I'll be right back. Up!

1916
01:34:38,816 --> 01:34:39,774
Get there.

1917
01:34:41,514 --> 01:34:43,690
Sir, you forgot your ID.

1918
01:34:43,734 --> 01:34:47,042
Uh, you know what, man,
why don't you keep it?

1919
01:34:47,085 --> 01:34:48,086
Thank you for your service.

1920
01:34:50,872 --> 01:34:52,612
Hey, man, what about the dog?

1921
01:34:52,656 --> 01:34:55,528
What are you...
What are you looking at?

1922
01:34:55,572 --> 01:34:58,705
Let's not make this
all emotional, okay?

1923
01:35:03,058 --> 01:35:05,451
[Lulu whining]

1924
01:35:19,161 --> 01:35:20,118
[Briggs] Dear Lulu,

1925
01:35:23,905 --> 01:35:25,645
I got the adoption papers
from the army today.

1926
01:35:33,262 --> 01:35:35,438
Riley would be so proud.

1927
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:37,135
[inaudible]

1928
01:35:38,354 --> 01:35:40,443
Maybe even of both of us.

1929
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,324
Look, I'm no good
at this poem stuff,

1930
01:35:52,368 --> 01:35:56,328
so I'll just
get to the damn point.

1931
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:00,376
Thanks.

1932
01:36:02,421 --> 01:36:03,553
Thanks for saving my life.
