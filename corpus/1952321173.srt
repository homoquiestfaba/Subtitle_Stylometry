1
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,628
Falllng ln love ls beautlful

2
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:08,041
We do it forone reason: nothlng
ln the world makes us feel so good

3
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,176
-Don't!
-''Don't!''

4
00:01:10,713 --> 00:01:14,205
-That hurts!
-Poor Kate Let me make it better

5
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:18,311
You're ugly You're ugly!

6
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:33,322
Flrst love ls the most powerful
because no one's been hurt yet

7
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:36,469
My flrst love was Bobby Norton

8
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:39,400
Everythlng he dld
had a sort of maglc to it

9
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:41,700
The way he smlled, talked

10
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,900
the way he walked llke my
favorite actor,Bllly Jack

11
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:47,604
Bobby was a movle star

12
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,660
You okay?

13
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:07,195
Maybe you shouldn't
shove so hard the next time

14
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:14,534
My heart just got bigger

15
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:22,539
When l do like this it looks like
you only have one eye

16
00:02:22,747 --> 00:02:24,738
Thank you

17
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:40,487
One of the dlfferences between men
and women when it comes to love

18
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:44,188
ls the need to tell the world
every little detall

19
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,868
lf you choose to splll your guts
to someone

20
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,128
just make sure
it lsn't Becky Sussman

21
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:00,243
Bobby, are you okay?

22
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:03,440
-How could you do it?
-What did l do?

23
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:06,587
You told everybody
How could you do that?

24
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:09,984
All my friends are making fun of me
And now it 's over

25
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,055
lt 's over!

26
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,460
Bobby!

27
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,624
l'll tell you friends l was lying!

28
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,694
l'll let you hit me harder!
Bobby!

29
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,940
Love ls a mlnefleld We take
a step,get blown to pleces

30
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:35,375
put yourself back together agaln
and stupldly take anotherstep

31
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,445
l guess that's human nature

32
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:41,141
It hurts so much to be alone that
we'd rather blow up than be slngle

33
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:23,984
Hey, Frank

34
00:04:26,128 --> 00:04:29,961
That doesn't make the elevator
go any faster, Kate

35
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:33,758
l know, but it makes me feel
more involved

36
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:36,502
-Are you angry?
-No Why?

37
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:39,172
l just heard single women

38
00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:41,967
tend to be 8 times angrier
than married women

39
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:45,872
Maybe you should write an article
about it, since you're not married

40
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:48,674
l would, but

41
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:54,343
l'm writing about married bald guys
who can't get hard without Viagra

42
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:27,913
-You're late
-l know

43
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,848
-Not a good day to be late
-Why not?

44
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:33,281
Because the Anti-Christ
is really pissed at you

45
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,186
She wants to see you
in her office right now

46
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:39,884
-God Why?
-l'm not supposed to say

47
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,958
-Do you have any stretch marks?
-Not yet

48
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,162
Damn! l have a deadline
on my Vitamin E piece

49
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:54,832
That bitch in accounting won't talk
Anybody here have stretch marks?

50
00:05:57,646 --> 00:05:59,671
Sit down

51
00:06:03,952 --> 00:06:05,783
God!

52
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:10,719
Don't get old, Kate
Old is ugly, ugly is death

53
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:15,326
-You're fired
-What?

54
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:20,591
Get me Leo Was this a joke? Were
you planning to turn in this thing?

55
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,132
You said l should make
the article my own, so l did

56
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:27,732
Kate, this is a step-by-step
description of sucking cock

57
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:31,104
-Yeah, l called it ''Blow by Blow''
-Very clever

58
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:35,437
''When life sucks, so should you
Oral sex can cure depression''

59
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:37,512
What the fuck were you thinking?

60
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:41,652
Maybe the title is a little harsh
But l found a great hook, no?

61
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:46,553
l meant you should draw from your
own experiences and relationships

62
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,190
That 's what l did

63
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:52,419
l know ten times more about blow
jobs than l do about relationships

64
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,121
l failed at every relationship
l've ever been in

65
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,129
l don't know about your personal
life, and l don't give a shit

66
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:00,770
The point is,
our readers still have hope

67
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:03,997
This is called Monique Magazine
My name is at stake here

68
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,573
lt is not called ''Tired Old
Jaded Dicksucker Review''

69
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:10,809
What if Mary writes the piece
on perfect relationships

70
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,541
and l do the thing on stretch marks?
l know tons of people with them

71
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:22,390
l'm gonna be completely
honest with you

72
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:25,116
l can't cope with being fired

73
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:29,024
This is the only thing in my
entire life l haven't failed at

74
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:31,790
l can do the assignment,
l know l can

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,901
Can you finish 2,5OO happy,
perky words by deadline tonight?

76
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:38,234
-Absolutely
-Then you are temporarily unfired

77
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,736
Now get the fuck out of here

78
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:48,882
Shit! Shit!

79
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,277
So were you fired?

80
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:54,077
Not yet

81
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:58,118
Somebody made a copy
of your article and circulated it

82
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:00,155
Pretty good

83
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:02,850
So you use your hands?

84
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:21,177
Happy, perky notes

85
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:25,543
on how to find and keep
that perfect man

86
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,089
We allwant to be loved

87
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:40,422
It doesn't matter by whom,as long
as they make us feel less alone

88
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:44,458
What makes a relatlonshlp
last forever?

89
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:49,164
lf l knew the answer,lwouldn't
be llvlng alone with my fourcats

90
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:59,371
They say you have to klss
a lot of frogs to get to the prlnce

91
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,244
Rlchard MlItnerwas the most
borlng frog l ever dated

92
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:05,943
But sometlmes you just
have to get out of the house

93
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:08,951
You know,
masculine and feminine

94
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,758
We lucked out pretty good

95
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,758
My mother's corns
aren't usually this bad

96
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:19,524
Lucky for us she wasn't able to walk
well enough to come to the show

97
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:22,600
lt 's haunting, don't you think?

98
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:25,163
What?

99
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:27,465
The paintings
They're pretty disturbing

100
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:33,169
-You think?
-lf l had a kid

101
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,847
l definitely wouldn't put
one of these up his bedroom

102
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:39,443
Unless l hated him

103
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:43,444
My father would've hung
stuff like that from my ceilings

104
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:47,549
He hated me
My mother hated me too

105
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:52,790
She used to tell me l was dying
of cancer when l was four

106
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:57,692
lt always sent me in depressions,
which is exactly what she wanted

107
00:09:57,902 --> 00:10:00,166
because then l wouldn't ask her
to make me lunch

108
00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:03,332
She hated it when l bugged her
for food or stuff

109
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:09,645
-Would you like a champagne?
-What?

110
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,105
A champagne, would you like one?

111
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:14,783
Yeah, absolutely

112
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:30,528
Are you looking for me?

113
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,967
l wasn't really looking for anyone

114
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:39,129
Do you mind if l talk to you
for a minute?

115
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,370
Sure

116
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:44,034
ln the corner

117
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,712
-ln the corner?
-l don't like the middle of rooms

118
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:50,213
Just come with me to the corner
No one's behind you in the corner

119
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,223
-Who's the guy you're with?
-What guy?

120
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,921
Richard? He's a stand-up comedian

121
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,499
He seems funny
ls he your boyfriend?

122
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:13,228
Richard? No He's 3O years old
and lives with his mother

123
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:16,073
So what do you think
of the paintings?

124
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:18,606
l love the style, but l think
they're a little immature

125
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:21,710
lmmature? What makes you say that?

126
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:23,710
Look at that one over there

127
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:27,446
-What the hell does it mean?
-That?

128
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:31,917
That means there's a woman pulling
a severed head out of her ass

129
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:35,351
What 's the point?
What do l learn from it?

130
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:40,090
Maybe that 's it There's no point
You don't have to learn anything

131
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:42,957
l wonder what the artist looks like

132
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,634
He must be scary to make this shit

133
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:50,465
Maybe he has a highly developed
dark side you don't understand

134
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:54,934
So how long did it take you
to paint that one?

135
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:04,180
Gosh, there you are
l've been looking all over for you

136
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:07,683
You are a doll
Look at this! Thank you

137
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:10,119
Richard, Adam Levy

138
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:17,264
-You're the artist
-You're the lucky guy

139
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:21,033
We were just getting around
to discussing our future children

140
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:23,464
Right, but l don't think you're
gonna have a future together

141
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:28,770
-l'm sorry Excuse me?
-You'd need to see the person again

142
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:31,170
You're not gonna be seeing her
anymore 'cause she's my girlfriend

143
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:33,311
-What?
-What?

144
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:35,673
When we laid eyes on each other

145
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:39,942
we had this spark Right?

146
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,153
-Kate
-lsn't that right, Kate?

147
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:43,753
No, actually

148
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:46,354
ls this some kind of joke?

149
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:49,856
No, but this is:
two guys walk into a bar

150
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:54,461
One guy is a 3O-year-old stand-up
comedian who lives with his mother

151
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:00,265
Could we go now, please?

152
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:09,273
You know, it is women like you
who turn men into weirdoes

153
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,077
Don't bother Once l've been hurt,
there's no turning back

154
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:19,916
That wasn't cool l made it weird

155
00:13:20,156 --> 00:13:22,681
-You shouldn't have done that
-l know

156
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:26,659
So where should we eat?

157
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:44,244
You are without a doubt the tallest
woman l've ever met in my life

158
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,679
Really?

159
00:13:48,782 --> 00:13:51,717
l've been noticing you have
these

160
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,319
long ET fingers

161
00:13:55,522 --> 00:13:57,716
Like a tree frog

162
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,525
My God! How big?

163
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:05,988
-Size 11
-Size 11?

164
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:07,723
-Yeah, size 11
-Woman's size 11?

165
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:10,060
ls this some kind of artist thing?
Focusing on people's flaws?

166
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:13,829
l don't see them as flaws,
but as God's artistic choices

167
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:17,497
l guess God decided to give you
this abnormally large head

168
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,873
You know what 's different?
You're being shitty and mean

169
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:26,311
And l was celebrating
your body, who you are

170
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:28,747
-You were celebrating my body?

l was an artist, l used to draw all
the pretty girls, made them better

199
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:11,075
They all loved me

200
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:14,010
They didn't sleep with me,
but they loved me

201
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:16,651
How about you?

202
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:19,185
You must 've been
real popular with that attitude

203
00:16:20,256 --> 00:16:23,157
No, l had huge buck teeth
and bony knees

204
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:27,227
And l slouched to hide the fact
l hadn't grown any boobs yet

205
00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:30,290
And my hair was all stringy
and everybody called me Horseface

206
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:32,660
Horseface? lt suits you

207
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:34,729

Don't, it 'll just make me jealous

211
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:46,580
Just make sure this one's longer

212
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,017
Adam was unllke
any guy I'd ever know

213
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:58,524
We were lnstant best frlends

214
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:02,058
Two people who understood each
other without havlng to say a word

215
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,626
It wasn't llke that at all
ln my flrst relatlonshlp

216
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:12,726
lwas a bad ldea to glve up my
vlrglnity to my French teacher

217
00:17:18,377 --> 00:17:21,744
lf two people want to be
a couple of them

218
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:26,406
it is good when they are making love
with each other, they feel nice

219
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:29,085

l don't think l can tonight though
l'm not really ready yet

222
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:44,827
Because you feel we don't have
the quality of life together

223
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:48,061
-l am sad for this
-What?

224

00:17:55,811 --> 00:17:59,645
-l am there for you needing me
-What?

227
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:12,219
Mr Bossard

228
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:15,055
are you doing it?

229
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:18,993
l can't believe it lt 's supposed to hurt

230
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,929
Maybe it 's because l've ridden
horses all my life

231
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,763
Are you smaller than most guys?

232
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:32,175
My older man daddy phase

by the tlme l ran lnto Erlc

-Are you okay?
-Are you blind? Out of your mind?

-There! You see that?
-How's that?

246
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,059
-Take that!
-Okay, break it up!

247
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:27,387
-Officer, l
-Shut up! Hands behind your back!

248
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:30,030
-Hit him with your big stick!
-You! Get up there!

249
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:36,533
-We got off on the wrong foot
-What?

250
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:39,104
You just destroyed my car!

251
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:43,242
l'm sorry about that
Maybe we could start over again

252
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:47,541
You got any plans for dinner
tonight after we make bail?

253
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:55,047
So this is where writers hang out?

254
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:58,782
What do you write about?

255
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:01,961
l'm working on a novel between
my journalism classes at UCLA

256
00:20:03,296 --> 00:20:05,127
A novel?

257
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:07,266
-What 's it about?
-Death

258
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:11,863
That sounds interesting

259
00:20:13,305 --> 00:20:15,796
So what do you do?

260
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:18,908
l work a lot with
Big Red-Ass Monkeys

261
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:23,772
lt 's a band You know, the band?

262
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:27,381
''Big Red-Ass Monkeys are here''
l direct music videos

263
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:30,577
lsn't that the one where the naked
girl swims with a chimp?

264
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:33,417
Ape Great ape

265
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,321
Right l guess chimps don't have
those big red asses

266
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:39,958
l don't know, l never checked

267
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:52,201
Do you think
maybe l could kiss you?

268
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:56,374
-Maybe later
-Maybe later when?

269
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:59,639
Maybe later like 5 seconds

270
00:20:59,949 --> 00:21:04,146
5, 4, 3, 2

271
00:21:56,468 --> 00:21:59,061
l hate when that happens

272
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:03,707
A toast to our
three-week anniversary

273
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:12,407
l think this is the longest
relationship l've ever been in

274
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,915
Well, not counting Mr Bossard,
which lasted one semester

275
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,389
-Did l ever tell you?
-Don't mention your French teacher

276
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,888
lt really disturbs me

277
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:27,760
-Good
-And your last relationship?

278
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,127
-God What about it?
-How long was it again?

279
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:35,933
-Five miserable years
-What did you have in common?

280
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,735
Nothing

281
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,171
What do we have in common?

282
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:44,970
-We have a lot in common
-Like what?

283
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:51,847
Like, how many people do you know

284
00:22:52,053 --> 00:22:54,953
who have sex in public places?

285
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:58,657
Every guy l've ever met

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,225
Good morning You know
what day today is, don't you?

287
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,957

-l thought it was my turn
-Nope lt 's my turn

289

You know what?
This game is idiotic

290
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:22,713
-lt 's not spontaneous
-That 's not true

291
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:26,247
Scheduled spontaneity is the key
to long-term love

292
00:23:30,288 --> 00:23:32,381
Don't look so happy

293
00:23:33,224 --> 00:23:35,657
l like Sundays

294
00:23:38,462 --> 00:23:40,487

-Get it or you're not getting it

300
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:10,683

concentration, okay?

00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,988
Where you going?

00:24:39,252 --> 00:24:42,949
-What are you?
-l understand how you feel

310
00:24:43,156 --> 00:24:46,386
You have no idea how anyone feels
You're a social climber!

311
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:50,255
-l'm planning on getting a divorce
-Don't ever touch me again!

312
00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:53,331
-Kate!
-Daddy!

313
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,768
Even when bad relatlonshlps end

314
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,166
the paln can be severe enough
to screw you up foryears

315
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:04,068
We all plck up a little baggage
afterevery breakup

316
00:25:04,275 --> 00:25:06,869
The hope ls that when the bags
start to accumulate

we're stlll able to drag them
lnto the next relatlonshlp

318
00:25:10,214 --> 00:25:12,704
Fortunately when Adam and l
moved ln together

00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,941
my carry-on baggage
was falrly llght

320

-Let 's put that one in the bedroom
-l was gonna put ''Paul's Entrails''

321
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:24,049
lt 's better for the bathroom

322
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:26,558
lf you want to be obvious

323
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:28,957

-Say it
-Why do you want me to say it again?

Because it was cute And l want

340
00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:19,658
When you flnally share your lonely
bed with the one you love

341
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:22,597
llfe just doesn't get any better

342
00:27:25,673 --> 00:27:29,837
-That was not me
-Stop Stop it

343
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:34,847
That was the first time you
That was your first fart

344
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:38,040
That was your first fart
You do love me

345
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:39,946
Don't blame it on me

346
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:42,951
That was so cute
You're embarrassed

347
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:45,646
Come here No woman has ever
farted in front of me before

348
00:28:37,973 --> 00:28:40,202
Hi

349
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:48,746
-Hi
-What?

350
00:28:49,284 --> 00:28:51,684
-What?
-Why are you smiling like that?

351
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:54,680
lt 's our one-year anniversary
You should be smiling too

352
00:28:57,157 --> 00:28:58,920
l guess so

353
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:02,862
Come here Come on

354
00:29:03,063 --> 00:29:06,555
No, come here
Are you a grouchy little bunny?

355
00:29:09,702 --> 00:29:12,637
l'm taking you to some place
very special today

356
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:15,273
-Where?
-lt 's a surprise

357
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:17,973
Go fill me the tub
and l'll take you

358
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:22,442
-Now, in the middle of the day?
-l feel very dirty l need a tub

359
00:29:22,714 --> 00:29:24,238
Forget it

360
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:28,943
Can you just fill me a tub?
Come on, you big grouch, just go

361
00:29:29,588 --> 00:29:33,456
My God, it 's like pulling teeth
with you to get anything

362
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:38,321
My God!

363
00:29:41,632 --> 00:29:44,499
Are you insane? What are we
gonna do with all these kittens?

364
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:46,932
l don't know
Make stew, l figured

365
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:51,605
What are they doing in there?
They like you, obviously

366
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:53,537
This one's Louie,
this one's Murray

367
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,938
This is Steve and
this is Mordecai

368
00:29:58,348 --> 00:30:00,816
l got them from
the Chinese restaurant

369
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,378
Hi, Mommy

370
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:06,110
Hello Aren't l cute?

371
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:09,051
Hi You are my new mommy now

372
00:30:11,193 --> 00:30:15,129
Bet the other 13 guys you slept with
didn't get you a litter of kitties

373
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:18,326
l'm pregnant

374
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,297
-You're really?
-l took a test and it turned pink

375
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:28,069
Pink? lsn't it supposed
to be like a plus sign?

376
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:32,672
Believe me, l know how to pee
on a stick and read directions

377
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:40,041
-l thought we were being safe
-Yeah, not safe enough

378
00:30:42,088 --> 00:30:46,217
-God, we hardly know each other
-We know each other

379
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:48,586
l just don't know if l'm ready
to be a mother, Adam

380
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:53,094
l'm too confused, too immature,
too messy

381
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,932
What about abortion? Did you ever
think about that

382
00:30:58,136 --> 00:30:59,535
possibility?

383
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:07,044
l just never thought this
would happen to me

384
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,406
-l don't know what to do
-Here, come here

385
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:16,118
Don't worry A lot of people think
it 's the world's greatest present

386
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,447
-What do you think?
-l'll tell you what l think:

387
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:25,457
that our baby would be the cutest
thing walking in poo-poo pants

388
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,025
Are you scared?

389
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:33,066
Of what? Of doing the most
natural thing in the world?

390
00:31:33,603 --> 00:31:38,063
Of bringing a gorgeous little
brilliant genius into the world?

391
00:31:38,274 --> 00:31:40,138
No l wouldn't be scared

392
00:31:40,342 --> 00:31:43,709
What if it wasn't a gorgeous genius?
What if it was an ugly little troll?

393
00:31:44,412 --> 00:31:46,710
l guess we just have to pray to God

394
00:31:46,915 --> 00:31:50,442
that the baby takes after me

395
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,944
We could name it Ned,
after my grandfather

396
00:31:55,155 --> 00:31:58,181
-What if it 's a little girl?
-Nedina, we'll call it

397
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:02,859
This one needs to be changed l want
you to practice to be a good mommy

398
00:32:04,064 --> 00:32:07,260
God, my stomach is huge!

399
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:10,226
l look like Buddha

400
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:13,166
You're the same as always

401
00:32:13,406 --> 00:32:15,806
So l've always had a Buddha gut?

402
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:19,945
Calm down You've been pregnant
a month The baby's too small

403
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:24,309
-Soon you'll look like a Volkswagen
-You have an abnormally large head

404
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:27,184
Come on, Horseface, get over here

405
00:32:27,653 --> 00:32:29,177
Come on

406
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,253
Let 's see what we got here

407
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:39,829
Ned wants a womb with a view

408
00:32:40,031 --> 00:32:41,328
Ned's not very funny

409
00:32:41,532 --> 00:32:45,434
Well, Ned's just a fetus
We should cut Ned a little slack

410
00:32:47,772 --> 00:32:50,968
And l think you're
more beautiful than ever

411
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,572
Are you okay, baby?

412
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:40,484
Are you okay?
What 's wrong?

413
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:46,552
l'm bleeding

414
00:33:46,826 --> 00:33:49,488
Something's wrong

415
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,493
Something is going wrong

416
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,666
Get up Get up

417
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:57,291
Where's your robe, baby?

418
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,527
-Where's your robe?
-l don't know

419
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,934
Do you think it 's possible
to love the same person forever?

420
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,108
-Sure Don't you?
-l don't know

421
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:43,505
l haven't seen a relationship that
didn't end one way or another

422
00:34:43,712 --> 00:34:46,442
What about your parents?
They've been together for 35 years

423
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:51,483
They live together, but they haven't
said ''l love you'' for 2O years

424
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:55,280
Maybe that 's human nature You spend
that much time around a person

425
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:00,017
saying ''l love you'' is probably like
saying ''cheese sandwich''

426
00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:02,919
God, l hope not

427
00:35:04,231 --> 00:35:06,391
Katie

428
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:13,331
-l cheese sandwich you
-l cheese sandwich you too

429
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:29,285
The longeryou're with someone,
the more annoylng they'll become

430
00:35:29,488 --> 00:35:33,753
You'll become annoylng too So lf
you want perfectlon all the tlme

431
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:36,324
don't bother havlng
a relatlonshlp

432
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:38,392
Did you see that little old lady?

433
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:44,862
-Didn't she look sad and lonely?
-l didn't look l need some shoes

434
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,262
Her eyes were so hollow

435
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:50,338
Old people have hollow eyes
Especially old women

436
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,303
-What?
-Can we go in here?

437
00:35:52,509 --> 00:35:55,069
What do you mean,
especially old women?

438
00:35:56,046 --> 00:35:59,345
-Women don't age as well as men
-How could you say that?

439
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,948
How many 5O-year-old women
do you see with 2O-year-old guys?

440
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:05,347
That 's a societal double standard
lt 's got nothing to do with facts

441
00:36:06,055 --> 00:36:08,819
Who looks better,
Sean Connery or Shelley Winters?

442
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,292
lt 's nature Men have thicker skin
That 's why women wrinkle more

443
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:17,158
-Shut up
-You're afraid to become obsolete

444
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:20,857
At a certain age men start to notice
younger girls lt freaks you out

445
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,968
Well, you're going bald!

446
00:36:26,741 --> 00:36:30,471
l have the keys!
Where are you going?

447
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:42,650
l've got one What do you have?

448
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:45,619
This with topless female ninjas

449
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:49,025
Let 's just get one 'Cause
we'll forget to return them

450
00:36:49,228 --> 00:36:51,822
and it will be 8OO dollars
for two movies

451
00:36:52,031 --> 00:36:54,727
-And which one do you want?
-''Nosferatu''

452
00:36:55,034 --> 00:36:57,729
You've seen it 5O times,
and every time you get depressed

453
00:36:57,969 --> 00:37:01,200
l like being depressed lt makes
me feel deep and introspective

454
00:37:01,406 --> 00:37:04,603
Wanna see what this is about?
Maybe you might like it

455
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:08,004
''Nasty naked ninjettes infiltrates
the mob and take over little ltaly

456
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:11,443
nunchacking their way to Mafia
Don Guido Mantucci''

457
00:37:11,882 --> 00:37:14,180
That sounds incredible

458
00:37:14,385 --> 00:37:16,182
Why do you have to do it?

459
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:18,981
You think l wanna go home
and snuggle

460
00:37:19,189 --> 00:37:21,714
and read subtitles and
watch in black and white?

461
00:37:21,926 --> 00:37:25,292
Can't we ever go to a goddamn
video store and not argue?

462
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:27,360
Not as long as you have
such shitty taste in movies

463
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:31,056
lt 's not true! How can you not
appreciate German Expressionism?

464
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:32,757
-l love German Expressionism
-Right

465
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:35,665
What l don't like is what you turn
into when you watch that movie

466
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:39,363
You get all fixated on death
''l'm gonna die, you're gonna die''

467
00:37:39,575 --> 00:37:42,874
Fine You watch your stupid titty
movie, l'll watch my death movie

468
00:37:43,078 --> 00:37:45,638
-You return yours, l'll return mine
-Fine

469
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:52,810
lt 's her birthday
One of these should be free

470
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:55,986
Romance

471
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,353
The most lmportant part of keeplng
a good relatlonshlp golng

472
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,929
Be sure to treasure each one of
those moments together ln bed

473
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:06,892
We haven't had sex in a while

474
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:10,259
We haven't had sex
in like three weeks

475
00:38:11,471 --> 00:38:13,701
You're not even listening to me

476
00:38:13,907 --> 00:38:15,465
No, l wasn't

477
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:18,439
l said we haven't had sex
in like three weeks

478
00:38:18,845 --> 00:38:22,211
Maybe it 's because you clip
your toenails in our bed

479
00:38:23,983 --> 00:38:26,679
What 's the real reason?

480
00:38:26,952 --> 00:38:29,318
l don't know

481
00:38:29,855 --> 00:38:32,688
Do you want to have sex right now?

482
00:38:32,891 --> 00:38:35,085
No Do you?

483
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:37,193
No

484
00:38:38,696 --> 00:38:42,393
-ls there something wrong with us?
-l don't know

485
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:45,331
Maybe we should force ourselves

486
00:38:45,536 --> 00:38:50,029
-What? Like mutual rape?
-lt might turn us on

487
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:04,182
-l'm tired
-Me too

488
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:15,261
-Love you
-Love you too

489
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:22,428
Don't do that You don't know
how much that bugs me

490
00:39:27,475 --> 00:39:30,034
l said don't!

491
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:38,480
lf you do that one more time,
l'm gonna scream

492
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:53,557
l think it 's over

493
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,597
What 's over?

494
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:58,770
Us l think we're done

495
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,699
What are you saying?

496
00:40:00,906 --> 00:40:03,534
l think l need to break up

497
00:40:06,111 --> 00:40:07,738
What did you just say?

498
00:40:07,946 --> 00:40:09,708
l said l think we should break up

499
00:40:09,914 --> 00:40:13,145
No You said you need to break up

500
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,079
-What 's the difference?
-There's a huge difference

501
00:40:15,419 --> 00:40:20,880
Saying ''we'' implies it is mutual
Otherwise it means you're ending it

502
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:26,119
-Are you ending it?
-l don't know l guess so

503
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,926
Have you met someone else?

504
00:40:32,102 --> 00:40:35,970
Nothing like that lt 's just we're
becoming this old married couple

505
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:39,671
God lt 's the 13 guys thing,
isn't it?

506
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:42,642
That 's what it is

507
00:40:42,845 --> 00:40:46,246
You've been obsessed with my past,
now you want to make it even

508
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:49,212
Shut up about that
lt 's not the 13 guys

509
00:40:49,418 --> 00:40:52,511
l'm over that, l've dealt with that
lt 's a non-issue, l promise you

510
00:40:53,788 --> 00:40:55,983
Then why now?

511
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,489
lt 's that l've never been single

512
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:03,461
l've spent my whole life going
from one relationship to another

513
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:05,426
And l've never been alone

514
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:09,090
Do you realize what you're saying?
Do you realize what this means?

515
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:11,702
What does this mean?

516
00:41:11,905 --> 00:41:13,998
lt means this is it, the end

517
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:16,835
And once it 's over, it 's over

518
00:41:17,043 --> 00:41:19,101
Yeah, l guess so

519
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:22,906
But it 's not like
we won't still be friends

520
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:24,946
Who said anything
about being friends?

521
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:27,619
We love each other
l don't wanna lose you from my life

522
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,779
Know that when you get to number 13
l won't be here waiting for you

523
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:35,482
Give that up, it 's not about that
lt isn't working for either of us

524
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,253
-You're not happy, are you?
-No, l'm not happy

525
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:42,627
-So neither of us are happy
-You're right l'm miserable

526
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,928
Could you stop?
You're packing my laundry now

527
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,661
Breaking up would be
the best thing for me!

528
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,741
You know what?

529
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:56,545
-l feel good No, l feel great
-Come back to bed

530
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:00,113
Already it 's like a weight
has been lifted off my head

531
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:03,975
-Can't this wait?
-l can breathe, l can think

532
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:07,054
All of a sudden life is clear
lt 's amazing!

533
00:42:07,256 --> 00:42:08,621
l am so happy!

534
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:11,786
When l look back
at the love l had with Adam

535
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:15,827
l see a pathetlc potted plant
nobody bothered to water

536
00:42:16,331 --> 00:42:21,496
It started out green and lush, then
eventually became a drled up stlck

537
00:42:29,577 --> 00:42:32,273
Breaklng up ls llke dylng,slowly

538
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:34,709
with nobody around

539
00:42:34,915 --> 00:42:37,315
That's why ls so lmportant
durlng that dark perlod

540
00:42:37,518 --> 00:42:40,749
to keep yourself busy dolng
the thlngs that don't depress you

541
00:43:04,076 --> 00:43:06,636
Fuck me! Jesus! Kate!

542
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:08,437
l can't believe it

543
00:43:08,647 --> 00:43:11,046
Our relationship hasn't even
started decomposing yet

544
00:43:11,249 --> 00:43:14,184
-Who's this?
-My friend Kate

545
00:43:14,652 --> 00:43:17,815
Kate, this is my friend
Peaches

546
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:21,483
This must be the friend
you just broke up with

547
00:43:21,692 --> 00:43:24,353
And this must be the friend
you just started fucking!

548
00:43:34,537 --> 00:43:35,936
Wait, wait

549
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:38,470
Peaches? My God!

550
00:43:38,674 --> 00:43:41,472
What the fuck
is that thing on your face?

551
00:43:41,677 --> 00:43:43,736
-Keep your voice down
-What are you doing here?

552
00:43:43,946 --> 00:43:47,848
This is my movie! You came to make
out with someone called Peaches?

553
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,574
-How dare you?
-l wanna call you Can l call you?

No l'm gonna get over you
And when l do, l'll call you

555
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:57,851
That could take days

556
00:43:58,893 --> 00:44:02,021
Okay, let 's see here

557
00:44:03,197 --> 00:44:05,357
That 's hideous

558
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,534
Here you go Kate, how about this?

559
00:44:08,735 --> 00:44:11,397
No That makes me look
like a drug addicted hooker

560
00:44:11,605 --> 00:44:15,097
l wanna look great
Like a drug addicted model

561
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:17,971
l don't see what the big deal is
lt 's just a birthday party

562
00:44:18,177 --> 00:44:19,872
Adam's gonna be there

563
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,673
-Aren't you over him yet?
-Of course l am

564
00:44:22,882 --> 00:44:26,682
l just want him to feel jealous
when he sees me with Jerome Davis

565
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,781
Jerome Davis? Wait a minute

566
00:44:29,989 --> 00:44:33,219
The perverted basketball player
who was obsessed with your ass?

567
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:35,782
He was?

568
00:44:36,027 --> 00:44:39,053
You got a great ass
You're a big woman

569
00:44:39,264 --> 00:44:42,563
but your ass is small and compact
to fit your size

570
00:44:42,968 --> 00:44:47,404
And yet if you take that ass and
put it on your little friend here

571
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:49,902
it would be fucking huge

572
00:44:50,908 --> 00:44:53,103
That 's it, l'm gone

573
00:44:59,882 --> 00:45:02,112

Don't you see?
This is really bad timing

791
01:03:22,238 --> 01:03:24,671
You can't just wait until l'm
involved with somebody else

792
01:03:24,873 --> 01:03:27,808
then suddenly propose marriage
or profess you love for me

lf you're happy,

806
01:04:20,324 --> 01:04:22,315
l made you miserable and l'm sorry

807
01:04:24,529 --> 01:04:27,794
-l just want you to know something
-What?

808
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:33,429
l can't be friends
l'm just too weak

809
01:04:33,637 --> 01:04:36,834
-Adam
-l can't even be around you

810
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,908
You're here like this incredibly
juicy ham sandwich

811
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:45,207
that l wanna eat, and l can't
because my lips are sewn shut

812
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:48,914
-That 's a pretty analogy
-You know what l mean

813
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,088
Have a nice life

814
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:05,130
Don't say that You know
we'll see each other again

815
01:05:05,366 --> 01:05:06,924
Yeah, right

816
01:05:20,447 --> 01:05:24,577
ls lnfatuatlon love?
No But it feels llke it ls

817
01:05:24,785 --> 01:05:28,720
All those chemlcals ln your braln
turn every word he says lnto poetry

818
01:05:28,921 --> 01:05:32,118
Did l ever tell you what l used
to do with my little brother?

819
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:37,028
Whenever he did something wrong,
l'd put dog shit under his pillow

820
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:41,791
l'd say ''Jimmy, go put you head
under the pillow and count to 2O''

821
01:05:42,634 --> 01:05:45,694
Half the time he'd get to 1O
before he realized what happened

822
01:05:45,904 --> 01:05:48,930
That was pretty stupid

823
01:05:49,207 --> 01:05:50,868
Jimmy? No

824
01:05:51,076 --> 01:05:54,568
He's a lawyer now
He's the smartest of all of us

825
01:06:02,253 --> 01:06:04,778
Now you remember me?

826
01:06:06,223 --> 01:06:10,625
Relatlons based entlrely on sex
end the mlnute the sex gets borlng

827
01:06:10,827 --> 01:06:13,193
So lf you want it to last
beyond borlng sex

828
01:06:13,396 --> 01:06:15,956
You'd bettertry to connect
on a deeper level

829
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:18,726
l brought us some cheese sandwich

830
01:06:18,935 --> 01:06:20,835
Thanks

831
01:06:24,406 --> 01:06:27,671
Do you think people can stay
passionate about each other forever?

832
01:06:29,278 --> 01:06:32,645
Yeah As long as they work
on the relationship

833
01:06:32,848 --> 01:06:34,975
and don't get fat

834
01:06:35,184 --> 01:06:36,946
l wonder

835
01:06:37,151 --> 01:06:39,745
l'm not sure it 's natural l'd like
to think it 's possible though

836
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:45,217
l think that, over time, we'll come
to take each other for granted

837
01:06:45,426 --> 01:06:47,189
And after the years
of staying together saying

838
01:06:47,395 --> 01:06:49,920
''l love you'' is like saying
''cheese sandwich'', you know?

839
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:54,191
Do you know that Robert De Niro
is lactose intolerant?

840
01:07:01,074 --> 01:07:04,532
Afterthe lnfatuatlon chemlcals
ln my braln stopped muItlplylng

841
01:07:04,743 --> 01:07:07,473
l began to get over
my non-judgmental phase

842
01:07:09,949 --> 01:07:14,511
Joey and lwere gonna have
a real conversatlon soon

843
01:07:15,955 --> 01:07:18,048
l'm gonna die

844
01:07:19,457 --> 01:07:22,790
-Are you listening to me?
-What?

845
01:07:22,994 --> 01:07:25,053
l'm gonna die

846
01:07:25,263 --> 01:07:27,094
When?

847
01:07:27,298 --> 01:07:29,425
Someday

848
01:07:29,634 --> 01:07:33,228
We're all gonna die
Watch the movie

849
01:07:34,438 --> 01:07:36,804
Doesn't that bother you?

850
01:07:37,007 --> 01:07:40,238
-l don't think about these things
-Why not?

851
01:07:40,444 --> 01:07:43,242
Look, we're in the middle
of a movie

852
01:07:43,447 --> 01:07:45,438
That 's when l think
about death the most

853
01:07:45,649 --> 01:07:49,106
All these people staring into
the darkness freaks me out

854
01:07:49,719 --> 01:07:52,244
-Don't you get that?
-No Okay? l don't get that

855
01:07:52,455 --> 01:07:55,481
Why should l get that?
l don't wanna get that

856
01:07:55,825 --> 01:07:59,885
That 's the problem
We are supposed to get each other

857
01:08:00,095 --> 01:08:02,393
You don't get me, l don't get you

858
01:08:02,597 --> 01:08:05,794
What? What the fuck
are you talking about?

859
01:08:06,001 --> 01:08:09,562
You know what my problem is?
l'm a floater

860
01:08:09,771 --> 01:08:12,569
l float through life like
a corpse on a river

861
01:08:12,774 --> 01:08:15,537
bumping into rocks and logs
l don't choose my path

862
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,143
-Shut up!
-l just bump into stuff, like you

863
01:08:18,345 --> 01:08:20,779
l bump into you in a porno shop,
Boom! l have sex with you

864
01:08:20,981 --> 01:08:24,144
Boom! l'm in a relationship with
you l don't think, l just boom!

865
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:26,945
-Shut the fuck up!
-So that 's what l am to you?

866
01:08:27,154 --> 01:08:29,917
l'm just some goddamn log
you bumped into in a porno store?

867
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:32,685
You're wearing sunglasses
in a movie theater

868
01:08:32,892 --> 01:08:36,692
-They're subscription
-That 's prescription, you idiot!

869
01:08:36,896 --> 01:08:42,891
Okay, Mrs Thesaurus l'm an idiot
You know, that 's it

870
01:08:43,502 --> 01:08:48,337
Hasta la vista, baby Here is a man
who will no take it anymore

871
01:08:49,141 --> 01:08:51,473
You're all gonna die
Think about it

872
01:08:51,677 --> 01:08:54,646
You're all gonna die
And nobody will remember you

873
01:08:54,846 --> 01:08:57,973
because they'll all be dead too!
Excuse me

874
01:09:03,387 --> 01:09:07,084
Hl, thls ls Adam I'm not home,so
leave your message afterthe beep

875
01:09:08,025 --> 01:09:10,288
Hl,Adam It's me

876
01:09:10,994 --> 01:09:13,292
Adam,are you there?

877
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,401
l dldn't wanna call anybody else

878
01:09:22,604 --> 01:09:24,469
Are you okay?

879
01:09:25,441 --> 01:09:28,774
-What 's wrong, baby?
-We broke up

880
01:09:28,977 --> 01:09:31,104
-God
-l broke upwith Joey

881
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:33,873
That 's horrible

882
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:37,077
-l'm such a failure
-You're not a failure

883
01:09:37,285 --> 01:09:40,152
l am l am a relationship leper

884
01:09:41,255 --> 01:09:44,691
Not true You have more relationship
potential than anybody l know

885
01:09:44,892 --> 01:09:46,951
Fuck potential
Anyone can have potential

886
01:09:47,161 --> 01:09:50,891
Are you kidding?
Your only problem is bad timing

887
01:09:51,098 --> 01:09:54,932
Two people could be perfect, and if
the timing's wrong, it won't work

888
01:09:55,869 --> 01:09:59,168
Bad timing is the reason that most
normal people end up single

889
01:09:59,373 --> 01:10:01,307
Normal people?

890
01:10:01,508 --> 01:10:03,772
Weirdoes are single because
they're weird

891
01:10:03,977 --> 01:10:05,603
but people like us

892
01:10:05,811 --> 01:10:09,008
we're single because
we're victims of bad timing

893
01:10:09,315 --> 01:10:11,783
Since when did you have things
so figured out?

894
01:10:11,984 --> 01:10:16,011
Since you fell in love and l've lain in
bed awake every night and wonder

895
01:10:16,222 --> 01:10:19,247
if l'd ever find anybody
who l feel as normal with

896
01:10:28,032 --> 01:10:30,865
No Bad timing, Adam

897
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:41,370
lf the timing's ever right,
you just let me know, okay?

898
01:10:44,648 --> 01:10:46,478
How about now? You think?

899
01:10:46,682 --> 01:10:50,118
Okay, that 's cool
Take as much time as you want

900
01:11:00,896 --> 01:11:03,421
Love ls ecstasy and agony

901
01:11:03,799 --> 01:11:06,734
freedom and lmprlsonment

902
01:11:07,135 --> 01:11:09,899
longlng and lonellness

903
01:11:10,405 --> 01:11:14,340
lt 's what keeps us together
when life tears us apart

904
01:11:16,444 --> 01:11:22,610
So, when you find that perfect man,
hold on tight

905
01:11:22,817 --> 01:11:26,843
And then call me so l can see
what he looks like and laugh

906
01:11:27,053 --> 01:11:29,749
because he doesn't exist,
you sad, perky

907
01:11:29,956 --> 01:11:32,925
little optimistic suckers

908
01:11:36,596 --> 01:11:39,030
l quit
l couldn't do the assignment

909
01:11:39,332 --> 01:11:43,267
l've always felt like a fraud here
Everything l wrote was crap

910
01:11:43,569 --> 01:11:46,333
And l'm a total sellout,
l can't do it anymore

911
01:11:46,538 --> 01:11:50,406
And honestly l'm sorry
if l've caused you any problems

912
01:11:50,742 --> 01:11:54,371
Wait a minute
She's way too fat

913
01:11:54,579 --> 01:11:57,605
Everything you've written here
has been bullshit?

914
01:11:58,082 --> 01:12:02,143
-Nothing has had a grain of truth?
-Nothing

915
01:12:02,353 --> 01:12:06,221
So your research on blow job
being able to cure depression

916
01:12:06,424 --> 01:12:08,391
is completely made up

917
01:12:08,592 --> 01:12:10,924
No, actually, that one was true

918
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:13,220
But it only works for the suckee

919
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,898
The sucker always stays depressed

920
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,601
l told you that

921
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:41,980
l'm here

922
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:45,159
Actually, could l ask you
a few questions if it 's okay?

923
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,788
Sure Go ahead

924
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:52,091
-Are you married?
-No

925
01:12:52,299 --> 01:12:55,393
-Do you have any children around?
-No

926
01:12:55,702 --> 01:12:58,899
Do you feel the need to have sex
with a lot of different women?

927
01:13:00,007 --> 01:13:01,474
-No
-Are you a liar?

928
01:13:01,675 --> 01:13:02,937
Yes

929
01:13:03,143 --> 01:13:04,700
Just kidding

930
01:13:05,978 --> 01:13:08,003
Good You've got a sense of humor

931
01:13:08,214 --> 01:13:10,842
That was my next question
Can you listen?

932
01:13:11,651 --> 01:13:14,051
l'm sorry, what?

933
01:13:14,253 --> 01:13:18,689
-You see how l?
-l get it Just one more, l promise

934
01:13:20,025 --> 01:13:23,517
Do you have a problem
with complicated women?

935
01:13:23,728 --> 01:13:26,162
Great Let 's go

936
01:13:26,431 --> 01:13:29,127
May l ask you one question?

937
01:13:29,334 --> 01:13:31,927
Of course l'm sorry,
ask anything you want

938
01:13:32,803 --> 01:13:35,465
Have you allowed Jesus Christ
into your heart?

939
01:13:36,073 --> 01:13:39,440
-God!
