(bass heavy rock music)

00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,573
(tires screech)

3
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:26,997
(gunfire)

4
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:31,403
(screaming)

5
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:38,267
(sirens blaring)

00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:43,597
(gunfire)

00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,900
(loud crash)

00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:56,327
(explosion)

9
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,873
* Wild, crazy,
and out of control

10
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:06,627
* Wild, crazy,
and out of control

11
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,227
* Her dad is insane
and her mom is too

12
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:14,833
* That girl will
be the end of you

13
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:18,873
* She's wild, crazy,
and out of control

14
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:22,167
* Six gun, blackjack,
she's naughty and nice

15
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:26,297
* She'll risk it all
for the toss of the dice

16
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,770
* Helter Skelter
across the floor

17
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:33,867
* You kiss her once
and she'll ask for more

18
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:37,067
* Wild, crazy,
and out of control

19
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:41,097
* Yeah yeah, wild,
crazy, and out of control

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,800
* Her dad is insane
and her mom is too

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,270
* That girl will
be the end of you

22
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:51,497
* She's wild, crazy,
and out of control

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,300
* Bad girls, good
times, she's ready to go

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,070
* It's not wrong if
her mama don't know

25
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:03,867
* (mumbles) let's go,
now don't look down

26
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:07,427
* Turn me over
and spin me around

27
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:10,833
* Wild, crazy,
and out of control

28
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:15,073
* Yeah yeah, wild,
crazy, and out of control

29
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:18,627
* Her dad is insane
and her mom is too

30
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:21,973
* That girl will
be the end of you

31
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:25,897
* She's wild, crazy,
and out of control

32
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,430
* Yeah, she purrs like a
kitten when you pick her up

33
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:33,703
* She takes what you got,
but it's never enough

34
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,100
* She starts and she
stops, she turns on a dime

35
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,700
* She spits and polish,
but she won't shine

36
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:43,197
* Wild, crazy, and

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,530
- Come on.
* out of control

38
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,630
- [Rhino] Hello?

39
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:48,873
- Oh thank God!

40
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:51,373
Really?

41
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,297
Rhino!

42
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,430
Rhino!

43
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,067
- [Vixen] Call's
disconnected, bitch!

44
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:35,303
(dramatic synthesizer music)

45
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,300
- Listen, please, don't kill me.

46
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,700
We can work something out.

47
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,870
(laughing)

48
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,730
- We already tried
that, remember?!

49
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,203
Besides, what do
you have to offer

50
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,570
besides dirty drugs
that kill buyers?

51
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:55,667
- Okay, so I've got some
bad customer service skills.

52
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,067
I'm sorry!

53
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,903
I'll clean the stuff up
and we'll split the profit.

54
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,730
Anything you want!

55
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:03,133
- You should've thought
about that before

56
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:06,073
you started selling to
kids and pregnant women.

57
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:08,427
- Hey, I only sell
to women in their

58
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:11,433
first trimester,
I've got standards.

59
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,930
Please, I'm begging you.

60
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,073
I'm not ready to die!

61
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:17,967
(screaming)

62
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:23,527
(laughing)

63
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,503
* Snap twerk pop, snap
twerk pop, snap twerk pop

64
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,630
* Your mama from the valley,
she twerking' like Natalie

65
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:31,203
* I'm from Arkansas, but
I'm showing out in Cali

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,400
* I'm parked in a Denali,
right there in the alley

67
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,470
* She like to call me
daddy, I'mma get money at it

68
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:38,597
* Drop it on the floor,
twerk it up some more

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,170
* You wanna see some care,
baby, show you who's a ho

70
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:44,197
* Get it how you live,
twerkin' in high heels

71
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,470
- (mumbles) the door, dumbass.

72
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:49,497
Get in the back.

73
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,730
* Twerk snap pop, make it
roll like them (mumbles)

74
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,733
* Song on repeat,
that pussy I'mma beat

75
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,433
* Long as you got (mumbles)

76
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,833
- [Voiceover] What
a load of bullshit!

77
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,233
This thing doesn't
even have a radio face.

78
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:00,603
The chop shop's
not gonna give us

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,200
shit for this piece of junk!

80
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,070
- Shut up, it's a
cash money job anyway.

81
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,697
It's not like we need the money.

82
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:10,127
(car revs)

83
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,203
- Yeah, yeah!

84
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:13,873
What the fuck?

85
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:15,327
- Shit!

86
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,303
Kane, he just called me!

87
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,070
Fuck!

88
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,633
- It's been a long
time, honey, hasn't it?

89
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:30,073
- Vixen, what are you doing?

90
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,397
- Just cleaning up the streets

91
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,070
and taking out the trash.

92
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,927
- You just started a
war, you dumb bitch!

93
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:35,833
(guns cock)

94
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:46,567
(gunfire)

95
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,773
- The war's over!

96
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:52,697
We won!

97
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,830
Let the others know that there's

98
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,833
a new queen in
town, and it's time

99
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,603
to clear out of her
territory, biatch!

100
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,430
- Woo!

101
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:04,273
- Yeah!

102
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:05,767
- [Voiceover] Woo!

103
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,200
* Be cool be cool, just
move with the groove

104
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,700
* Fucking hear the
beat way too smooth

105
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,070
* Let's just do
what we came to do

106
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,627
* Just vibe with
it, vibe with it

107
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,203
* Vibe with it, vibe with it

108
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,270
* Be cool be cool, just
move with the groove

109
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:23,497
* Fucking hear the
beat way too smooth

110
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:26,773
- You're Vixen, right?

111
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,327
- The one and only, honey.

112
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,603
- You deal down in Echo
Park, what brings you

113
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,730
to my neighborhood?

114
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,503
- Well I was thinking
about moving up

115
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,100
in the game, I thought you might

116
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,900
be the man I need to talk to.

117
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,070
- Well Kane runs
this end of town,

118
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,827
so Kane is the man
you need to talk to.

119
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,973
- I hear he doesn't
have a head...

120
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:48,067
For business.

121
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,930
- What do you have a head for?

122
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,303
- [Vixen] Definitely more
pleasure than business.

123
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,770
* When the mic touch this MC

124
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,497
* Without the mic
this MC feel empty

125
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,900
* I'm telling you now,
it's the lyrical recipe

126
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,230
- Why don't you step into my

127
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,073
office and we'll have a chat.

128
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,967
* Accept and expect
no less than the best

129
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:10,267
* Inject and collect
without disrespect

130
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:12,067
* Be cool be

131
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:13,267
- Are you crazy?

132
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,597
- We're taking over
this town and either

133
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,600
you're with me or
you're against me.

134
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,730
Well?

135
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,903
- You're such an amateur.

136
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,630
I'm gonna stick with Kane.

137
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,633
You're a loser.

138
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:29,633
- I killed him, looks
like he's the loser.

139
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,803
- You killed Kane?

140
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,270
Cool, then I'll go independent.

141
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:38,427
- No you won't, and you're
gonna lose something too.

142
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:40,833
- Do it.

143
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:41,833
(gun clicks)

144
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
You're out of your mind.

145
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,070
And my gun is out of bullets.

146
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,767
Now it's loaded,
and you just ran

147
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:56,367
down a dead end alley.

148
00:07:56,367 --> 00:08:01,067
(suspenseful music)

149
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,503
Woo hoo hoo hoo!

150
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,300
Oh yeah!

151
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:25,070
Time to die, amateur!

152
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:32,133
Did you really kill Kane?!

153
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,873
Well that's life
in the big city.

154
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:38,303
Such a pretty amateur.

155
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,100
Too bad you're gonna die.

156
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,470
Time to die, amateur!

157
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:45,327
- Hola, cabron.

158
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,503
- Oh shits.

159
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,173
- Like I said before,
I'm taking over

160
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,197
this town and you're
either with me

161
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,170
or against me, so
what's it gonna be?

162
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,327
- Give it up, Vixen,
just let me go

163
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,103
and I will disappear.

164
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:01,967
- Yeah, you'll disappear okay.

165
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:03,897
Into dumpsters!

166
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,100
- (sobs) No no no,
just let me go!

167
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Just let me go.

168
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,630
- What, is this too
"amateurish" for you?

169
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,133
(car engine revs)

170
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,127
(laughing)

171
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:25,233
- No!

172
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:31,227
No!

173
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:36,673
Noooo!

174
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,130
Noooo!

175
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:48,967
- [Vixen] What's wrong?

176
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,967
It's not like this is nothing
we ain't never seen before.

177
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:55,067
- I just really hope you know
what you're doing, Vixen.

178
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,167
- What's up your ass?

179
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,897
(singing in Spanish)

180
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,067
Woo, let's party!

181
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:06,127
We taking over this town!

182
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:08,567
- Woo...

183
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,767
- What's up?

184
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,167
- Nothing to celebrate I guess.

185
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:12,667
- What do you mean
there's nothing

186
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,067
to celebrate, we just took out

187
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,297
Kane and some of his best men!

188
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,200
What!

189
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,670
- Where's Sarita and Katie?

190
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,467
- Who knows, they're doing
their own celebrating.

191
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,367
Woo, woo, woo!

192
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:24,197
(laughing)

193
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:26,667
- I love you.

194
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,067
- You're such a fag.

195
00:10:29,067 --> 00:11:01,597
(overlapping Spanish music)

196
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:08,073
- Stop camping,
you fucking noob!

197
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,627
- How long have we
been playing this game

198
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:11,903
and you're still
complaining about campers.

199
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,500
- I don't care, these
assholes want to

200
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,300
play the game, they
(mumbles) fucking douchebags.

201
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,370
- Vixen, we need to talk.

202
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,067
- Can't it wait?

203
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:25,597
- No, it's important.

204
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,070
- We're in the middle
of a game and we're

205
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,127
(mumbles) these assholes!

206
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:36,697
- Vixen, please?

207
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,497
- What's so important?

208
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,100
- I want out.

209
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,430
- Want out?

210
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:48,573
We just made a huge power play.

211
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:50,527
It's smooth sailing from here.

212
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:52,073
- They're gonna
retaliate, Vixen.

213
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:54,267
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

214
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:55,797
- Those pussies
are nothing without

215
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,100
their precious leader.

216
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,930
If they know what's
good for them,

217
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:00,333
they'll get out of town.

218
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,203
- Vixen, you're
underestimating their loyalty.

219
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,630
I'm just, I'm sorry, but I'm not

220
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:05,333
taking that chance, okay?

221
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,603
I'm done.

222
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,430
- What?

223
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:08,333
You're done?

224
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,303
After all I've done for you?

225
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,130
Bullshit!

226
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:13,927
- I'm sorry, Vixen.

227
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,070
- Fucking bitch.

228
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,130
She'll be back.

229
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:48,973
(remixed rap music melody)

230
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,200
- Boss, here's the
latest batch for you.

231
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,700
What do you think?

232
00:12:58,067 --> 00:12:58,897
- Bonzai.

233
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,300
- Bonzai.

234
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:08,833
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

235
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,803
- Vixen and...

236
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,070
- Calm down and tell
me what happened!

237
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:17,967
- Vixen threw Kane's
head in the window!

238
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:21,127
They killed Crash and
Bulldog right in front of me!

239
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,473
- Those stupid
(mumbles) bitches!

240
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,527
What the fuck they
were thinking about?!

241
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,173
What the fuck they
were thinking about?!

242
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,297
We're going to make them pay!

243
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,170
All right, we will
make them pay!

244
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:35,067
- How are we gonna do that,
they took out half our crew!

245
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:37,597
- Let me show you how.

246
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,070
- Grrr!

247
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:43,127
- Sir, we have a situation
that needs your attention.

248
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,803
(singing in Spanish)

249
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,297
- [Voiceover] Another
death at a local

250
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,170
high school has a
community on edge.

251
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:51,067
It appears that a
new, high powered

252
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:53,067
form of methamphetamine
is hitting

253
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,497
the streets causing
an unprecedented

254
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,800
amount of overdoses.

255
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,470
Anyone with any information,
please call One Police Plaza.

256
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:04,827
I'm Doctor Drew Sterling and
I'm here to help your kids.

257
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,303
Stay tuned.

258
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:11,227
- We have to do something
about CainKane's dirty drugs.

259
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,803
We can't just sit
back here and watch

260
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,070
these kids get caught
up in this shit.

261
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,627
- What can we do?

262
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,073
- Hit up the streets,
see if we can

263
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,567
find some dealers
that still have

264
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,697
some death meth left to sell.

265
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,200
- I mean we know
they're associated

266
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,170
with Kane, it
shouldn't be that hard.

267
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,267
- Okay, let's do this.

268
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,767
Electra, you come with me.

269
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,727
Sarota, you take Katie,
you know what to do.

270
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,073
- Where's Kandy?

271
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,703
- She's not happy with the way

272
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,470
we're doing things right now.

273
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:39,867
She said she wants
out, but I just

274
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:42,267
think she needs some
time to herself.

275
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,897
Let's just focus at the
task at hand right now.

276
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,630
- All right.

277
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:57,433
(singing in Spanish)

278
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,697
- Help, I need help please.

279
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,200
- What the heck's
wrong with you?!

280
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,600
- I need, I need, I need you to

281
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,800
get the fuck out the car.

282
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,400
Get out, get out,
get out, get out!

283
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,130
Get out, that's
a nice ass dress.

284
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,400
Those shoes don't match though.

285
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:28,170
- Hey, that's my car!

286
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,373
- So you got it?

287
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,497
- Yeah I've got it.

288
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,630
You got the money?

289
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:37,803
- Let me see it.

290
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,970
- (mumbles) see it.

291
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:40,197
- Let me see the
shit man, come on.

292
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,470
- How long have we
been working together?

293
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:42,967
Of course I'll let
you see the shit.

294
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,127
I don't want you
dealing, messing with the

295
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:46,103
death meth anymore.

296
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,370
All right?
- All right, all right,

297
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:48,467
all right, I got it.

298
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,527
- This is clean shit.
- All right.

299
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,703
- It better be good shit.

300
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
- It's good.

301
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,070
- I'm outta here, later.

302
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:55,697
* Straight out the hood

303
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,970
* Ladies and gentlemen

304
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:59,067
* Put your hands together

305
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:00,827
* For the one, the only

306
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,073
* My man, your man too

307
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,197
* Brad

308
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:07,073
- Oh, how's it
going, Big Elliot?

309
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,627
- Nothing man, how you
doing there, Big Baby?

310
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:09,473
- Yeah!

311
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:10,297
- Yeah!

312
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,130
- Yeah!

313
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:11,973
- You got that meth?

314
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:13,127
- You know I got it.

315
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:14,273
- Sweet dude, this
has been really

316
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:15,667
happening me out
with my weight loss.

317
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:16,827
- I'm glad it's helping man.

318
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,273
- You know what I
mean, sprinkle a little

319
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:19,567
bit of this on my fried chicken?

320
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:20,867
Woo hoo hoo hoo!

321
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:22,297
It gets me crazy
(mumbles) running around!

322
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,800
- Elliot, Elliot I
gotta go, okay Elliot?

323
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,630
- Yeah yeah.

324
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:26,473
- I gotta go, okay?

325
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:27,297
- Don't run too fast.

326
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,500
- You should get out of

327
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,430
there too, Elliot!
- Don't run too fast!

328
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:37,373
- Get out of there, Elliot, go!

329
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,733
- Easy big boy,
don't wanna slice

330
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:43,733
an artery with this.

331
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,203
- I don't want any trouble.

332
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,370
- Too late for that.

333
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:48,067
Say adios to your
balls, muchacho.

334
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:49,667
- Wait wait, what do you want?

335
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,967
- You're gonna answer
a couple of questions.

336
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,067
- Sure, what do
you need to know?

337
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:56,967
- What is the
capital of Montana?

338
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,597
- How the fuck should I know?

339
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,870
- Sarita, remove the balls.

340
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,697
- No no, ask me
something I know.

341
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,900
- Have you been
pushing that shit

342
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,170
that Kane's been dealing?

343
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,067
- [Voiceover] Fuck no!

344
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,367
- Don't lie!

345
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:08,367
- [Voiceover] I'm not
lying, that shit is deadly!

346
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:09,697
I need my customers to come back

347
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,600
for repeat business or
I'm out of business!

348
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,500
I'm not lying, I swear
on the life of my

349
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,130
pet rat Spunky that I'm
not dealing that shit!

350
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:18,533
- Fair enough.

351
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:20,473
Do you have any idea who
has been dealing that shit?

352
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:22,567
Keep in mind your
answer to this very

353
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:24,527
important question may very well

354
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:26,733
determine whether
you can fuck again.

355
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:27,933
- Oh I know who it is.

356
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:30,173
It's this tall chick
with gigantic tits.

357
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,467
She deals it by the liquor store

358
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,927
near Echo Park, do you
know where that is?

359
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:35,733
You're not gonna miss this girl.

360
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,303
This is the girl who's
been dealing that

361
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,630
shit at the schools
and that's fucked up!

362
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:41,203
- Thanks for your cooperation.

363
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,900
- No problem.

364
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,430
- Now run along, puto!

365
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:48,433
- Si, senorita!

366
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:57,273
- Oh yeah, that fits the bill.

367
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,800
Hey!

368
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,133
- What's down, Foxy Brown?

369
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,303
- We're looking for something to

370
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,630
make us feel a little happy.

371
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:11,697
- You're not a couple
of 5-0s are you?

372
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,630
- Fuck no.

373
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,127
Ain't nobody here the po-Pos.

374
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,303
- Yeah, okay.

375
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:20,127
I got something
that'll knock your

376
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,673
pretty little heads off.

377
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,397
- Yeah, me too.

378
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:30,800
(suspenseful music)

379
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,603
- (mumbles) fuck, okay?

380
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,870
Fuck!

381
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,827
- Welcome to the S.S.
Vixen, I doubt you're

382
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,833
gonna enjoy your ride.

383
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,873
- What in the hell
is this all about?

384
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:48,067
- Fasten your seat belt.

385
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,627
(coughing)
- Do you work for Kane?

386
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,773
- Yeah, I did until some crazy

387
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:54,627
fucking bitches cut his head...

388
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,103
I mean Kane was an asshole.

389
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,300
- Don't get smart.

390
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,070
Have you been dealing his meth?

391
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:03,497
- Well yeah, I work for
Kane so I deal his stuff.

392
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,570
- And you've been pushing
that shit in schools, correct?

393
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:08,227
- Yeah, but it wasn't my idea.

394
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:10,603
Look, I'm just a small
time drug dealer, lady.

395
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,700
I just take my orders
from higher up.

396
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,700
- From Cain?

397
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,530
- Well yeah.

398
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:15,733
- That's wasting, baby.

399
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:17,333
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa, stop!

400
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,173
But I get my stuff
from someone else!

401
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,897
I don't know his
name, but he's the

402
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,730
middle man between Kane
and all the dealers.

403
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:25,733
They keep that shit locked
up tight in a warehouse.

404
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:28,273
It's like some
kind of a fortress.

405
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,967
- Are you sure you
don't know his name

406
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:32,067
or the location
of this fortress?

407
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:33,697
- No, I'm sure.

408
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm sure, I've been
honest with you.

409
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,100
- Then you're no use to us.

410
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,370
- But I told you everything
you needed to know.

411
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:41,767
- Well you can tell that to
the kids you sold drugs to.

412
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:44,327
Oh wait, no, you can't.

413
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,373
Electra?

414
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:46,197
- No!
(gunshot)

415
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,070
Ahh!

416
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,733
- Hey!

417
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,833
You forgot something.

418
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,503
- Oh yeah, that's right.

419
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,300
(laughing)

420
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:13,470
(dramatic rock music)

421
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,727
- Kane?

422
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:20,573
Dead?

423
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:23,433
God!

424
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:29,333
Bitch!

425
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,733
Cunt!

426
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,873
Lesbo!

427
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,130
That's not mine, I
have to pay for that!

428
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,370
- No more death meth!

429
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,567
You're dealing us
stuff you know.

430
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,067
- The hell I am.

431
00:20:52,933 --> 00:20:55,803
All right, all right,
I'll deal your stuff.

432
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,870
I'll deal your stuff until
The Phantom deals with you.

433
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,527
- Who the hell is The Phantom?

434
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,073
(laughing)

435
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,697
- Nobody knows who
The Phantom is.

436
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,400
He's totally
underground, you'll know.

437
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,700
He'll get you, you've opened up

438
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,600
a can of scorpions, Vixen.

439
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,730
- You know, that's what
everyone's been telling me.

440
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:12,773
I don't care.

441
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,127
- There's still time.

442
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:14,973
(laughing)

443
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,273
Can I go?

444
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:20,627
- Sure.

445
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:21,933
- Not thataway.

446
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:23,173
Go down the street.

447
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,327
- What?

448
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,933
- Yeah, Katie's
taking your whip.

449
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,267
- That's bullshit!

450
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:32,167
Ahh!

451
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:56,127
(remixed rap music melody)

452
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:01,827
- We need to get more
information on this

453
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,403
middle man and find out
where the warehouse is.

454
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,300
Electra, you and Sarita
hit up the street

455
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,830
and see if you can
get some information

456
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,533
on this middle man.

457
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:11,303
- Think Jennettie
knows anything?

458
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,070
- He's been working
this case for a year

459
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:16,067
and a half, he better
know something.

460
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:30,697
- All right.

461
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,127
- Freeze, titcock!

462
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:37,403
- Jesus Christ!

463
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,227
You can't keep doing that,

464
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,503
you're gonna give
me a heart attack.

465
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,700
- Calm down.

466
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,200
You're the one who
wanted to see us.

467
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,430
- Yeah, and we have a
favor to ask you too.

468
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:48,073
- What can I help you with?

469
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,127
- We've been recently
investigating the death

470
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:52,833
meth overdoses and I
think we have a lead.

471
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,173
- Investigating?

472
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,597
Isn't that my job?

473
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,700
- Yeah, and we could use
your help to solve the case.

474
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,100
We could use your help putting

475
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,700
the final pieces into place.

476
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,900
- Pieces?!

477
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,500
You mean what, like
pieces of bodies you

478
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,630
crazy broads are leaving
all over the street?!

479
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:08,103
(laughing)

480
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,300
- What are you gonna do?

481
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,670
Give us a ticket for littering?

482
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:11,927
- No, but someone's gonna give

483
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,633
you a bullet in your back.

484
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:16,303
You gals are playing
a losing game.

485
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,800
Good thing I like you.

486
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,630
What information do you have?

487
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,703
- Apparently
there's a middle man

488
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,630
between Kane's men
and the dealers.

489
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:27,073
I need his name, and
there's a warehouse

490
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:29,467
where they keep the dirty junk.

491
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:32,127
- Well the "middle man" really
isn't the middle man at all.

492
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:35,173
It's Sabu, Kane's
second in command.

493
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,327
He helps distribution
run smoothly.

494
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,903
- What about the warehouse?

495
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,070
- As far as I know it's just a

496
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:42,967
storage unit on the
upper East side.

497
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:45,567
- They're storing their drugs
in a fucking storage unit?

498
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:47,797
That stupid asshole
called it a fortress.

499
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,470
- Fortress?

500
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:51,327
Pretty lame, right?

501
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,103
- Lame is an understatement.

502
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,670
What did you need
to see us about?

503
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,067
- Well the higher
up's gonna pull

504
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,267
me off undercover soon
and start cracking

505
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:02,067
down on the meth
distribution in the area.

506
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,267
I'm gonna need you girls
to lay low for awhile.

507
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:05,897
- Are you kidding me?!

508
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,070
We just made a power play to get

509
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:09,767
the dirty shit off
the streets and

510
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:12,067
you're telling me you
want us to lay low?

511
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,627
- Listen, I can't do
anything about it.

512
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:15,273
They're putting
together a task force.

513
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:16,897
And they're not gonna play nice.

514
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,170
- You better find a way to
keep them off our backs.

515
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,527
We'll hate to let your captain

516
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:22,603
know you've been
letting us slide.

517
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,430
- Is that a threat I heard?

518
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,233
I don't want you
girls to get hurt,

519
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,103
but this isn't my call.

520
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,470
- [Vixen] Your concern?

521
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:40,767
It's noted, sweetheart.

522
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:46,327
We can't do anything about the

523
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,103
middle man at the moment,
but they're storing

524
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,070
their stuff at a storage
unit in LA Storage.

525
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:52,567
- Seriously?

526
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:54,397
What the hell is wrong
with these idiots?

527
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,270
- [Vixen] Your guess's
as good as mine.

528
00:24:56,267 --> 00:24:57,367
Listen, Katie's gonna meet you

529
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:58,797
outside her place and I'll meet

530
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,570
up with you guys later.

531
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,727
- Okay, see you soon.

532
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:04,133
- I gotta get a
couple things from

533
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:05,173
the clubhouse and I'm gonna meet

534
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:06,297
up with you guys later.

535
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,500
- All right, okay.

536
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:14,070
- All right.

537
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:19,697
- (low distortion)
This is The Phantom!

538
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,870
What the fuck is going
on with my town?!

539
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,497
I want these girls dead!

540
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,530
I want these stones
out of my shoe!

541
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:28,133
Do whatever you have to
do, get rid of these girls.

542
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:32,373
I want a ton of the death
meth on the streets tonight!

543
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,703
(ominous music)

544
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,300
- [Katie] Let me out of here!

545
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:49,127
- [Sarita] What is
(mumbles) coming from?

546
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:50,073
- I don't know,
but she acted like

547
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:51,527
it wouldn't be long.

548
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,573
- All right, I guess we're
just gonna have to wait then.

549
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:54,727
- Will you stop that?

550
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:56,773
You are making me nervous.

551
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:59,397
- No, I won't, not until you
tell me who we're meeting.

552
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,100
* He got a Can-Am
and pistol grip

553
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,070
* He got the right tires,
he can make them stick

554
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:08,227
* He's the king of
the slot car track *

555
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,203
- Andre!

556
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,370
- Sabu!

557
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:11,627
- So good to see you
again, my friend.

558
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:12,603
- You too.

559
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,500
- You look good.

560
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,700
- [Andre] Hey, all right.

561
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,900
- You know what, I just wish it

562
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,370
was under better circumstances.

563
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,197
- God, you were always such
a good friend to my brother.

564
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,830
I just wish he'd
come to me for help.

565
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,633
So damn stubborn.

566
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:24,173
If I'd have been there, none
of this would have happened.

567
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,327
- Don't blame yourself.

568
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,773
We were all blindsided
by those bimbos.

569
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:28,967
- Those little
bitches have no idea

570
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,397
what they've gotten
themselves into.

571
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,330
Okay, they've unleashed
the dogs of war.

572
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,303
- Exactly.

573
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,770
- Listen, enough talk.

574
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:37,597
We're gonna make
those whores pay.

575
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:40,773
Starting with this little
slutbag right here.

576
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:41,767
(rock music)

577
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:54,330
(laughing)

578
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:00,167
- What are you doing here?

579
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:02,867
- I was just grabbing
some of my things.

580
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:04,827
Hey, I want you to
know this doesn't

581
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,073
change anything
between us, okay?

582
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:08,327
I still and will always think of

583
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,333
you as the big
sister I never had.

584
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,733
- So you're really gonna
go through with this?

585
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:13,903
- Yes.

586
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,970
Please don't hate me.

587
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:15,897
(phone rings)

588
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,270
- I don't have time for this.

589
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:29,070
Katie, incoming call, go to PC?

590
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:34,973
- Hello, Vixen.

591
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:37,067
It's nice to have a face
to go with the name.

592
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:38,227
- Who the fuck are you and how

593
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:40,303
did you get Katie's phone?

594
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,870
- My name isn't important.

595
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:44,167
But what is important is
that you killed my brother.

596
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:45,467
Now you're gonna pay.

597
00:27:45,467 --> 00:27:47,497
You're all gonna pay.

598
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,170
You see, I take protecting
my own very seriously

599
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:53,067
and you, well, you took
the only family I had left.

600
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:56,467
So now I'm gonna take
something from you.

601
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,430
(dramatic sting)

602
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:01,603
- Please don't hurt
her, it's me you want.

603
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,070
- That's very noble of you.

604
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:04,597
I do want you.

605
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,330
I want you to suffer.

606
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,703
I want you to know
that, because of you,

607
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,400
all your friends
are gonna suffer.

608
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,570
And after you watch
all of them die,

609
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,327
I'm gonna give you the
gift of sweet release.

610
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,833
I'm saving you for last.

611
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,233
(laughs) See?

612
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:22,403
I'm not such a bad guy.

613
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,230
(laughing)

614
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,270
Oh, so where was I?

615
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,430
Oh yeah.

616
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,830
You're gonna pay for your crimes

617
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:34,833
with the lives of
everybody you care about.

618
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:37,873
- She had nothing to do with
the death of your brother.

619
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:39,327
It was me.

620
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,270
And it's me who you want,
so just let her go please.

621
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:46,827
- Oh yeah, I will have you.

622
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,473
You can bet on it.

623
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:50,197
But first, I think
I'll have some

624
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,330
fun with your
little friend here.

625
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,773
Say goodbye 'cause this is the

626
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,697
last you're ever
gonna see of her.

627
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,970
(laughing)

628
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,970
Katie, anything you'd
like to say to Vixen?

629
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:02,867
- Vi--

630
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,527
- Oh, oh, she's speechless!

631
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:06,473
(laughing)

632
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,197
Tell your friends to be ready.

633
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,370
'Cause they're next.

634
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:19,067
Hey Katie, wanna hear a joke?

635
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:30,570
- Bye, Vixen.

636
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,067
Vixen?

637
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:41,767
- You were right.

638
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:45,067
Everything's gone to shit!

639
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,100
I need your help.

640
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:50,697
- [Andre] There's this
rich guy, all right?

641
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,630
He's gonna marry
one of three women.

642
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:54,803
So he gives each one
of them 10 grand.

643
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,270
The first broad spends
it all on herself.

644
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:01,297
The second broad
spends it all on him.

645
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,600
And the third starts a
business and gets rich.

646
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,270
So who did he marry?

647
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,700
- The one who got rich?

648
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:14,933
- He married the one
with the biggest tits.

649
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:16,803
You're overthinking
it, it's a guy.

650
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,370
Guys like big tits!

651
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,000
Let's see what you got.

652
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,230
(ominous music)

653
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,100
- Hey girls, want a hit?

654
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,070
Stole it from the evidence room.

655
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:31,167
- [Vixen] Just tell
us what you found out.

656
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:32,627
- [Jennettie] His name is Andre.

657
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:35,973
He worked at Thousand Oaks
with a small group of thugs.

658
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,127
(groaning)

659
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,600
- [Andre] Ha, look
at that, Lakers.

660
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,630
- We don't have a
last name, but we do

661
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,373
know he's one mean
son of a bitch.

662
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:47,997
He once set fire to a liquor
(phone rings)

663
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,730
store while the owner
was still inside all

664
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:52,673
because he didn't have the
right brand of tequila.

665
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:54,067
- [Sarita] Jesus
titty fucking Christ,

666
00:30:54,067 --> 00:30:55,667
why the hell aren't they
answering their phones?!

667
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,627
- I don't know, but Katie
should've been here by now.

668
00:30:57,633 --> 00:30:58,803
- You know what, fuck this.

669
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,130
Let's just go by
the storage lockers

670
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:01,503
and we'll try to get
a hold of them later.

671
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,300
- [Electra] Sounds like a plan.

672
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,870
- [Vixen] Let's go, Kandy.

673
00:31:04,867 --> 00:31:06,627
Thank you, Jennettie.

674
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,130
- Girls, be careful.

675
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:11,133
(rock music)

676
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:15,633
- Get the hell off of me!

677
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:16,833
- I used to do porn.

678
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,333
You know what you
gotta have for porn?

679
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:20,503
- I think you've
already shown me!

680
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,970
- They call it
the rule of eight.

681
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,697
Eight inches.

682
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,970
Feel it?

683
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,267
You feel it?
(screaming)

684
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:29,697
Oh, and you gotta live
in the 818 area code.

685
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,930
See?

686
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:32,133
818 number.

687
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,530
And you gotta go 80
minutes before you pop.

688
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:38,173
See, we've been at it for 90.

689
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:40,067
- Feels like 900 years!

690
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,530
* He's an eight lane
demon burning up the track

691
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:49,173
* So don't you mess around

692
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:52,097
* He's the master's
trigger in this here town

693
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,070
* Look out buddy,
he'll shut you down

694
00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:58,667
- Shit, oh shit, I'm
gonna pop, I'm gonna pop!

695
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,067
Point of no return!

696
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:04,197
* He's the king of
the slot car track

697
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,797
- Oh shit, oh shit,
here it comes.

698
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:13,427
There she blows!

699
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,603
(gunshots)

700
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,470
- If you wanna keep breathing,

701
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:23,067
you'll tell us where
Andre's hanging out at.

702
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,527
- I haven't seen him in weeks!

703
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:26,533
- Well you better
tell us something,

704
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:30,073
or my friend here, she's
gonna make brain slushie.

705
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:31,067
(gunshot)

706
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,130
- Oh man, that was a good lay.

707
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,173
Who's up for sloppy seconds?

708
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:40,327
Sabu, this pussy's
still warm and wet.

709
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,970
- She reminds me of my ex.

710
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:46,127
Just dead and laying
there, I think I'll pass.

711
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,233
(laughing)

712
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,503
- That's funny.

713
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,570
That's funny, hey, you
ever skull fuck your ex?

714
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:53,567
- I never really wanted to.

715
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:55,297
- Super, more for me.

716
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,870
* Snap twerk pop, snap
twerk pop, snap twerk pop

717
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:04,067
* Snap twerk pop,
snap twerk pop *

718
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,867
- That must be it.

719
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:09,067
- Now if you work that
corner right there,

720
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:11,497
guarantee you'll
make a lot of money.

721
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,700
- Really?

722
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,630
- Especially in that
outfit, it's great.

723
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,403
Look at that, man.

724
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,200
These things here?

725
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Oh my goodness gracious.

726
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:22,697
- Cheeky.

727
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,330
- (laughs) That's great.

728
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,073
Right over there in
that corner, all right?

729
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:27,967
Turn into that corner.

730
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:28,797
Oh shit.

731
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,570
I'll handle this.

732
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:33,167
- [Voiceover] Okay.

733
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,330
- I don't want no trouble.

734
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:37,633
* That booty look nice

735
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:39,873
* Twerk, snap, pop, make
it roll like some dice

736
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:42,597
* Song on repeat,
that pussy I'mma beat

737
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,800
- [Vixen] You know everything
that goes on in this town.

738
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,070
I need some
information from you.

739
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:51,767
- Well maybe I can help
you and maybe I can't.

740
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:54,867
Word is you girls'
time is about out.

741
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,100
- You work for Kane.

742
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,600
- Worked until you killed him.

743
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,930
- I need to know
where the meth lab is.

744
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,400
- Really?

745
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,930
You really want to know?

746
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:09,073
Look at this.

747
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,867
No thanks, can't help you.

748
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,267
- Can't or won't?

749
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:16,497
- Can't!

750
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,070
You girls are hotter than a nest

751
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:20,527
full of rattlesnakes
in Death Valley.

752
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:22,933
You know there's a
contract out on your lives.

753
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:26,173
- I'm desperate, and my
friend, she might die.

754
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:28,897
- If I told you
what you wanna know,

755
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,070
I'd be dead tomorrow.

756
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:32,567
Aw hell, I could be dead now for

757
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:34,827
just talking to you!

758
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:36,403
- You are not help.

759
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:39,467
- Wait.

760
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:41,827
You really oughta just move.

761
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,603
Leave town!

762
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,930
Forever!

763
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:46,733
You're not really wanted here.

764
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:48,103
I know this neighborhood.

765
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,130
This community doesn't need you!

766
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:52,203
Doesn't need you,
just go, leave town!

767
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,400
It's a nice place, you know?

768
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Just go and don't come--

769
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,570
(loud crunch)
Ow!

770
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:58,427
Oooh, oh, open the
door, open the door!

771
00:34:58,433 --> 00:35:00,603
My dick is stuck in the
door, open the door!

772
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,400
Ow, ow, open the door!

773
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,600
- Where is she?!

774
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,800
- [Huggy] I don't
know where she is,

775
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,330
look, my schmeckle's
gonna fall off!

776
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,573
Open the damn door!

777
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:09,267
- It's gonna fall of
then 'cause (mumbles)!

778
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:10,327
- Oh my God!

779
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,533
- Where is she?!

780
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:12,603
- I know where she
is, open the door!

781
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,930
My schmeckle's gonna fall off!

782
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:15,373
- [Vixen] You know where she is?

783
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:16,827
- I know where she is, I
don't know any meth labs!

784
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,073
- I don't believe you!

785
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:20,067
- I don't know any meth
labs, I don't know!

786
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:21,967
Now stop the car,
give me my dick back!

787
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:23,667
- You better tell
me fucking now!

788
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,597
- I'm bruising my cock,
would you open the door?!

789
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,270
Please, please, please!

790
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:28,197
(screaming)

791
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,800
- Oh my God!

792
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,670
(sobbing)

793
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,667
Help me please!
- Huggy!

794
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,967
Somebody help me!

795
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,367
Somebody help me!

796
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:43,427
I lost my dick!

797
00:35:43,433 --> 00:36:04,773
(suspenseful rock music)

798
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,073
- [Sarita] Fuck this,
I'm tired of waiting.

799
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,467
- Let's just do this.

800
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:13,867
Now's our chance.

801
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:25,627
(dogs barking)

802
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:30,973
(groaning)

803
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:40,397
(music intensifies)

804
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:46,067
- Boom, bitch.

805
00:36:50,067 --> 00:37:03,397
(loud explosion)

806
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,930
- Nothing like a good skull fuck

807
00:37:08,933 --> 00:37:10,773
session to ease the
tension of day-to-day life.

808
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:12,397
Sabu, I need you.

809
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,700
- Yes Andre, as long as...

810
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,600
You're not going
to skull fuck me.

811
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,600
- Look, I left so much DNA,
the CSI scanners would explode.

812
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,630
Okay, I need you to make sure
nobody ever finds her body.

813
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:22,633
You got it?

814
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:24,273
- All right, consider it done.

815
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:25,767
- Looks like me
and you are gonna

816
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:29,267
be spending some
more time together.

817
00:37:29,267 --> 00:37:33,427
- Yes Andre, that's what
I've always wanted, you know?

818
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:36,767
- (distorted voice)
This is The Phantom.

819
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:39,467
Congratulations on
eliminating one of the girls.

820
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,197
But there are four left.

821
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,400
Get to work!

822
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:47,967
- [Sarita] What the
hell is going on?

823
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:49,227
You nor Katie showed
last night and

824
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,103
me and Electra took out
the drugs by ourselves.

825
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,670
Plus Katie never showed up.

826
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:53,767
And she didn't answer
her goddamn phone,

827
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:55,967
what the fuck gives?

828
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:56,797
Well?

829
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,970
What the fuck?!

830
00:37:57,967 --> 00:38:00,667
- Sarita, you need to chill.

831
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:01,967
- Where's Katie?

832
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,300
- Katie was
kidnapped last night.

833
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,700
- Oh my God.

834
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,200
- By who?

835
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,730
Where is she?!

836
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:14,573
What the fuck are we
doing to get her back?!

837
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:16,667
- She was kidnapped
by Cain's men.

838
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:19,527
I did everything I
could to find her, but--

839
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,273
- [Electra] But what?

840
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,167
- [Vixen] We'll
never see her again.

841
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:27,327
- [Electra] And you
didn't think to tell us?

842
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,803
What the fuck is
wrong with you?!

843
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,800
- I did everything
I could to find her!

844
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,700
I hit up the streets, I checked
his old stomping grounds.

845
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,070
Nothing, I came up with nothing.

846
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,697
- Are you telling me she's dead?

847
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,500
- I'm sorry, but I
think she's gone.

848
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,770
- You're sorry?

849
00:38:48,767 --> 00:38:50,797
You're fucking sorry?!

850
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,100
Fuck you!

851
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,730
You killed her!

852
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,703
You wanted to push Kane
out of those streets

853
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,970
and take over everything,
that was your call.

854
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,467
We were fine before
then, but no,

855
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,127
you wanted to save
the children and take

856
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:02,603
the dirty drugs off
the street leaving

857
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,230
Electra and I killing
thugs and burning

858
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:06,403
drugs while Katie
was in trouble!

859
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,900
- Guys, come on,
we all knew what

860
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,830
could happen when
we took out Kane.

861
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:14,497
- Why don't you just shut
the fuck up, all right?

862
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,130
Because we are drug dealers.

863
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:18,273
We don't fucking go
out saving people!

864
00:39:18,267 --> 00:39:20,067
So fuck them and fuck you!

865
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:20,927
- Sarita!

866
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,900
- [Sarita] That fucking bitch,

867
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,570
I need to kill
that fucking bitch!

868
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,497
Fuck her, fuck her!

869
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,900
(door slams)

870
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,200
- So if you wanna tell
me you were right, don't.

871
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,730
I didn't know Kane
had a brother.

872
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:40,403
- Vixen, I just
think that we need

873
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
to lay low for awhile and just

874
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,230
let things go back to normal.

875
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:45,633
- Lay low?

876
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,873
Lay low?!

877
00:39:47,433 --> 00:39:52,073
Kane's brother is coming
to kill us one by one!

878
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:55,867
If anything, it's
time to strike back.

879
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:56,697
- Or run.

880
00:39:58,067 --> 00:39:59,897
- I am not for running.

881
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:04,203
I am for killing that
son of a bitch right now.

882
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,930
- Vixen, you know
that I would follow

883
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:08,133
you to the gates of
Hell, but this is

884
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:09,833
a neverending cycle, okay?

885
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,133
We kill one of
them, so they kill

886
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:12,573
one of us, and then
we kill more of them,

887
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:14,797
where does it end?

888
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,230
We need to just think
beyond our guns for once.

889
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:21,203
(rock music)

890
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:27,697
* They get some hot chicks
'cause they think he's cool

891
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,630
* He used to go
to my high school

892
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:34,503
* He's the king of
the slot car track *

893
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,270
- Listen, I have some bad news.

894
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,767
(video game beeps)

895
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:40,267
- What would that be?

896
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:41,997
- Someone broke into
our storage and set

897
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,270
fire to a large quantity
of drugs last night.

898
00:40:45,267 --> 00:40:46,627
- Wasn't it your
job to make sure

899
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:48,133
that that didn't happen?

900
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:50,273
- So they took out (mumbles).

901
00:40:50,267 --> 00:40:52,967
You know, when I was
getting of the girl's body.

902
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,167
- Are you making excuses?

903
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:55,097
- No sir.

904
00:40:57,567 --> 00:40:59,597
- I'm not sure I believe you.

905
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,970
Tell me who's at fault.

906
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:03,397
- I guess it's me.

907
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,230
- So something's gotta be
done about this, right?

908
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:06,673
Some sort of punishment?

909
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:07,927
- I'm sorry.

910
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:09,533
- What does sorry get me?

911
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,833
- I'm sorry.

912
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,403
(gunshot)

913
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,300
- Let this be a warning.

914
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,600
You fail me again and
you'll end up like...

915
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,530
Whoever the fuck that was.

916
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:21,073
You understand?

917
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:22,227
- Yes sir, thank you.

918
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,573
- Before you told
me the bad news,

919
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:26,227
there was something
I was gonna say.

920
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,733
Ah, yeah, that's the right.

921
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:28,973
My men have arrived,
they're already out

922
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:31,297
on the street looking
for Vixen and her crew.

923
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,300
Everything's going
according to plan.

924
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,600
Soon the taste of sweet
revenge will be upon us.

925
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,800
Well, not everything's
going according to plan.

926
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,070
- So what's our next move?

927
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:43,467
- We're gonna flood
the streets with

928
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,527
out final batch of death meth.

929
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:48,673
Release it all at once,
create a huge panic.

930
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:50,397
And the best part?

931
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,430
We're gonna pin it all
on Vixen and her crew.

932
00:41:52,433 --> 00:41:54,403
- Are you sure
that's a good idea?

933
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,770
How are we gonna deal drugs if

934
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:57,497
all our customers are dead?

935
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,230
- Oh, you got a better idea?

936
00:42:00,233 --> 00:42:01,903
- Yeah, why don't we make some

937
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,470
really good meth, like
on that TV show with

938
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:08,127
the bald guy who makes
the really good shit?

939
00:42:09,867 --> 00:42:12,727
What's that thing called?

940
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,903
He has that really clean setup.

941
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,200
- Is it on The Disney Channel?

942
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,130
(record skip)

943
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:18,303
- No.

944
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,700
- I only watch The
Disney Channel.

945
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,230
Lot of cute little young
girls on The Disney Channel.

946
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:25,833
All waiting to grow up to
become stupid little whores.

947
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:29,233
- Yeah, yeah, that's
a great idea, Andre.

948
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:33,967
We'll pin it on
those stupid whores.

949
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,273
It's a great idea, guys.

950
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:38,667
- Good, I'm glad we're all
on the same TV channel.

951
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:40,127
Now let's get that
last batch of death

952
00:42:40,133 --> 00:42:42,333
ready for deployment.

953
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:44,603
Sabu, please clean that up.

954
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,070
- Yes sir, I will.

955
00:42:49,067 --> 00:43:08,597
(exotic trance music)

956
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:22,900
- Let's go kill those assholes.

957
00:43:26,867 --> 00:43:28,297
So I've been thinking
of a way to get

958
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,070
back at Andre and get
vengeance for Katie.

959
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,667
I know it's not
gonna bring her back,

960
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:35,527
but it's the least we can do.

961
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:37,103
You guys in?

962
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,100
- I'm in.

963
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,770
- Count me in.

964
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:42,527
- [Vixen] I just wanna
try this one thing.

965
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:44,673
If it doesn't work
we quit, run away,

966
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:46,167
lay low, whatever.

967
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:50,067
Kandy, I need you on this.

968
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:52,127
- Come on.

969
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:53,333
Do it for Katie.

970
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:56,073
- I really think we
should just lay low.

971
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:58,327
- Kandy, I can't do
this without you.

972
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,433
You or your brother Rhino.

973
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:01,433
- Rhino's your brother?

974
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:02,803
Are you fucking kidding me?!

975
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,570
- I haven't spoken to
him in over a year.

976
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:06,067
- Talk about a switch hitter.

977
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:07,367
- How do we know this
bitch isn't a mole?

978
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:09,367
- She's one of them,
we can't trust her.

979
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:10,867
- Guys, I have been
with you for over

980
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:13,067
two years now and
nothing like this has

981
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,827
happened until someone
decided to wipe out

982
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:18,173
the competition which I
was against, all right?

983
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:20,067
Now Vixen, what's the plan?

984
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:21,567
- If we get Kandy
to get her brother

985
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:23,197
to lure Andre and his whole gang

986
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,800
out into the open, then
we can ambush them.

987
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:29,597
- Wait, including Rhino?

988
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,100
- What about him?

989
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,070
- I don't want my
brother getting hurt.

990
00:44:33,067 --> 00:44:35,127
- Well if he's a part
of the problem then...

991
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:36,303
- Well he won't be.

992
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,530
Something tells
me that he doesn't

993
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:39,403
want any part of
this war either.

994
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,700
- Okay, he won't get hurt.

995
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,100
You have my word.

996
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:46,267
Okay, Kandy, you
call your brother,

997
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:50,197
let him know you need to
meet him somewhere private.

998
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,700
Everybody okay with this?

999
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,700
Otherwise we lay low.

1000
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,070
- Got it.

1001
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,527
- No problem.

1002
00:44:56,533 --> 00:44:59,203
- Well I prefer that we lay low.

1003
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,400
But all right,
let's do this shit.

1004
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,670
(phone rings)

1005
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,830
Hey big brother, it's
been a long time.

1006
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,430
- Kandy?

1007
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:15,773
- Yeah, it's me.

1008
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
- I've been thinking a lot about

1009
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,500
you lately, how have you been?

1010
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,200
- Listen, we need to talk.

1011
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,230
It's important,
somewhere private.

1012
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:26,703
- I agree.

1013
00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:30,067
Can you meet me at the old
junkyard in say two hours?

1014
00:45:30,067 --> 00:45:32,597
- Yeah, and make
sure you come alone.

1015
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,830
- I will.

1016
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:35,473
I love you, sis.

1017
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:36,727
- Love you too.

1018
00:45:41,067 --> 00:45:42,827
- Interesting.

1019
00:45:42,833 --> 00:46:22,433
(dramatic rock music)

1020
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:28,473
- It's great to
see you again, sis.

1021
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:30,527
- Yeah, it's great
to see you too.

1022
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:33,133
It's been a long time.

1023
00:46:33,133 --> 00:46:35,433
- I wish it were under
better circumstances.

1024
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:36,273
- I know.

1025
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:39,203
I need your help.

1026
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,630
Well actually, we
need your help.

1027
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,533
- We?

1028
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:45,073
Who's we?

1029
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:47,097
- Vixen and the
others, we're in huge

1030
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,300
trouble, they took Katie--

1031
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,870
- Yeah, I know, I know you are.

1032
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:52,567
Andre is a crazy
fuck, and if you guys

1033
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:54,327
didn't kill Kane
he'd still be up

1034
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,303
in Thousand Oaks
trying to kidnap

1035
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,330
young girls with
an ice cream truck.

1036
00:46:58,333 --> 00:46:59,473
- Wait, you knew that they had

1037
00:46:59,467 --> 00:47:00,697
Katie and you didn't tell me?

1038
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,400
- Well what was I
supposed to do?!

1039
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,430
That's not gonna happen to you.

1040
00:47:04,433 --> 00:47:06,073
I promise.

1041
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:08,797
- Well well well well
well, what do we have here?

1042
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,200
A family reunion?

1043
00:47:11,467 --> 00:47:13,467
Ah, how touching.

1044
00:47:13,467 --> 00:47:15,067
Rhino, my man, I
want to thank you

1045
00:47:15,067 --> 00:47:16,667
for leading her to us.

1046
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,727
You know your sacrifice
won't go unrewarded.

1047
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:20,073
- How could you?!

1048
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:21,327
- No, Kandy, I--

1049
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:25,127
- Rhino, I think
it's time for you

1050
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:28,503
to be a good little
soldier and peace out.

1051
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,930
I got it from here.

1052
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:32,073
This will put me
back in with Andre.

1053
00:47:32,067 --> 00:47:35,367
- Listen, Sabu, Andre's
wheels are off the rails!

1054
00:47:35,367 --> 00:47:37,067
He's gonna ruin everything!

1055
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:38,327
- I know.

1056
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:41,473
Then you and I will take over.

1057
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:44,367
Until then, just
hand me the bitch.

1058
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,770
- All right, you want her?

1059
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:52,697
(gunshots)

1060
00:47:54,300 --> 00:48:21,200
(bass heavy rock music)

1061
00:48:25,700 --> 00:49:28,430
(groaning)

1062
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,070
- She's not here.

1063
00:49:34,067 --> 00:50:00,467
- Hey, you fall back, all right?

1064
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:05,873
- Hey raghead!

1065
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:23,497
(gunshot)

1066
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,603
- Merry fucking Christmas.

1067
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:44,870
(gunfire)

1068
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,130
- Fuck these (mumbles)!

1069
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,000
- Don't let him get away!

1070
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,800
(gunfire)

1071
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,700
- Vixen!

1072
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:30,470
- So long, bitches!

1073
00:51:34,233 --> 00:51:36,073
- All right, so we're
gonna make this death meth.

1074
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:39,067
I'll show you how, don't
screw it up, pay attention.

1075
00:51:39,067 --> 00:51:40,467
I got all your things
you're gonna need,

1076
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:43,427
you got your flasks, your
beaker, boiling flask,

1077
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:48,173
mix all that shit together,
it's gonna look like this.

1078
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:50,267
What the hell happened to you?

1079
00:51:50,267 --> 00:51:52,797
- [Sabu] Rhino has betrayed us.

1080
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,830
I set up an ambush to
kidnap one of Vixen's crew.

1081
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:58,073
He shot me, he fucking shot me!

1082
00:51:58,067 --> 00:52:00,127
- You did this
without my approval?

1083
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:01,773
- Boss, I had no time.

1084
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:05,067
I grabbed some men and
followed them to the meeting.

1085
00:52:05,067 --> 00:52:06,427
- Men?

1086
00:52:06,433 --> 00:52:07,733
Whose men?

1087
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:09,303
- Your men, sir.

1088
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,400
- Sabu, where are my men?

1089
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:14,533
- Vixen showed up
and kill all of them.

1090
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:16,603
- You're 20 times the fool!

1091
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,330
How many times
you gonna fail me?

1092
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:20,173
- [Sabu] Sir, I'm
sorry, never again.

1093
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:22,067
I'm sorry, sir.

1094
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:23,067
I'm sorry--

1095
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:24,667
- That's right never again.

1096
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:26,597
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1097
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,200
- Goddammit, I don't
know why, but I like you!

1098
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,400
I would've shot somebody else,

1099
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,800
but we got so few men left.

1100
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,470
Okay, we end this now.

1101
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:39,267
I got reliable intelligence
on where Vixen's hideout is.

1102
00:52:39,267 --> 00:52:41,467
Go get yourself patched up.

1103
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:42,967
You, back to work.

1104
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:46,273
All right, where were we?

1105
00:52:46,267 --> 00:53:03,767
(remixed rap music melody)

1106
00:53:07,733 --> 00:53:09,233
- [Jennettie] What
is it with you girls

1107
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:11,103
and sneaking up on people?

1108
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,470
You okay?

1109
00:53:12,467 --> 00:53:15,067
- [Kandy] Not really,
I've been shot.

1110
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:15,867
- Shit.

1111
00:53:18,067 --> 00:53:19,497
Was it .38?

1112
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,330
- Oh my God, does it matter?

1113
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:22,503
- Let's go to the hospital.

1114
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,900
- No no no no, not
a hospital, please,

1115
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,200
can you just patch me up
yourself or something?

1116
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,270
- Patch you up?

1117
00:53:27,267 --> 00:53:28,597
Am I a fucking doctor?

1118
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,530
I'm a cop!

1119
00:53:29,533 --> 00:53:31,873
- Please, please Jennettie.

1120
00:53:34,767 --> 00:53:35,627
- Get in the car.

1121
00:53:35,633 --> 00:53:40,233
- Thank you.

1122
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:45,573
(groaning)

1123
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:53,067
- [Electra] Easy.

1124
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:58,697
(Vixen screams)

1125
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:01,603
It doesn't look so bad.

1126
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,670
- It looks like
there's still some

1127
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:03,967
shrapnel stuck in there.

1128
00:54:03,967 --> 00:54:05,667
- I stabbed the shit out
of those motherfuckers.

1129
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:06,497
- Shh.

1130
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,830
(sirens wailing)

1131
00:54:08,933 --> 00:54:11,073
- Where's my sister?!

1132
00:54:11,067 --> 00:54:13,897
Oh shit.

1133
00:54:18,267 --> 00:54:20,367
Go get some alcohol.

1134
00:54:20,367 --> 00:54:21,827
- [Electra] How bad is it?

1135
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:25,173
- Doesn't look like
it hit anything vital.

1136
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:26,667
(inaudible)

1137
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:28,427
(dramatic rock music)

1138
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,927
- Shit, here comes
the hit squad.

1139
00:54:31,933 --> 00:54:33,673
- We gotta go.

1140
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:39,527
Come on, let's go.

1141
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:47,600
(gunfire)

1142
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,300
- Outside.

1143
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,230
(gunfire)

1144
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,630
- Go, but take her alive!

1145
00:55:10,967 --> 00:55:12,267
- Wait, where's Sarita?!

1146
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,527
- Stayed behind to
buy us some time.

1147
00:55:13,533 --> 00:55:15,833
- No, I'm the one
who deserves to die!

1148
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:22,503
- The one who deserves to
die is that fuck Andre.

1149
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:28,673
- Back off or I'll
cut up his throat!

1150
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:30,067
- [Rhino] Gotta get
you back to my place

1151
00:55:30,067 --> 00:55:33,267
to get that bullet
out and find Kandy.

1152
00:55:33,267 --> 00:55:37,797
(gunshot)

1153
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,500
- Well this didn't go
as planned, did it?

1154
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,630
Too bad I didn't have more time

1155
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,173
to play with my
little latina lesbo.

1156
00:55:47,167 --> 00:55:48,167
- (mumbles).

1157
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:52,073
(loud hissing)

1158
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:02,170
(loud explosion)

1159
00:56:06,633 --> 00:56:13,903
(siren wailing)

1160
00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:19,127
- I'm gonna take
her to the other

1161
00:56:19,133 --> 00:56:20,603
room and get her patched up.

1162
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,700
Keep an eye out.

1163
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,230
Let me know if
anything feels off.

1164
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:25,133
- Okay, will do.

1165
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:32,133
(siren wailing)

1166
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,600
- [Vixen] Ahh!

1167
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:43,900
- Sorry.

1168
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,070
This is gonna hurt, but
you're gonna be okay.

1169
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:53,227
(screaming)

1170
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:58,267
You're right, it hurts
like a motherfucker!

1171
00:57:02,233 --> 00:57:05,133
- [Rhino] You know
I've missed you.

1172
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:09,727
You don't have to
feel the same, but...

1173
00:57:09,733 --> 00:57:12,103
I never stopped loving you.

1174
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,500
- [Vixen] We made
our choices and

1175
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,800
we have to live with them.

1176
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,300
- Choices?

1177
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,070
You made a choice.

1178
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,467
I had to live with it.

1179
00:57:19,467 --> 00:57:20,467
- I'm sorry!

1180
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,230
I didn't know what to do.

1181
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:25,473
I didn't think we were ready.

1182
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:29,067
- For you I was always ready.

1183
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:36,697
- Wow, Stevie, you
do really good work.

1184
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,530
- Thanks.

1185
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:57,227
(siren wailing)

1186
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:04,667
- [Jennettie] Should
be good to go.

1187
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:06,527
You need some rest.

1188
00:58:06,533 --> 00:58:08,473
- Thanks, I owe you one.

1189
00:58:08,467 --> 00:58:09,967
- So what the hell's going on?

1190
00:58:09,967 --> 00:58:13,067
How many bodies are
around this time?

1191
00:58:14,067 --> 00:58:15,497
- Hey, do you have any cigs?

1192
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,870
Or is all you have is a
bunch of drugs and guns?

1193
00:58:18,867 --> 00:58:24,267
- It's right there.

1194
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:30,527
- All right, so basically
shit is hitting the fan.

1195
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:32,073
I tried to stop it
all, but Vixen is

1196
00:58:32,067 --> 00:58:33,527
making all these
horrible decisions

1197
00:58:33,533 --> 00:58:37,373
and I don't even have
my phone with me.

1198
00:58:37,367 --> 00:58:39,067
Mind if I use yours?

1199
00:58:42,367 --> 00:58:52,067
- Sure.

1200
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:57,833
It's right there.

1201
00:58:59,733 --> 00:59:01,433
- Thank you.

1202
00:59:01,433 --> 00:59:03,103
- [Jennettie]
Listen, I gotta go.

1203
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,730
There's word of a large
influx of death meth.

1204
00:59:05,733 --> 00:59:09,533
It's supposed to be unleashed
upon us pretty soon.

1205
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:11,733
I've been taken off
undercover duty.

1206
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:14,673
Now I'm leading the raid
on a supposed location.

1207
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:17,097
You're welcome to stay
here as long as you need.

1208
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,270
- [Kandy] Thanks.

1209
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:19,867
But really, thanks
for everything.

1210
00:59:19,867 --> 00:59:21,697
Seriously, I won't forget it.

1211
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,200
- Rest up, I'll
check on you later.

1212
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,330
* Be cool be cool, just
move with the groove

1213
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:29,873
* Fucking hear the
beat way too smooth

1214
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:32,127
* Let's just do
what we came to do

1215
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:33,433
* Just vibe with
it, vibe with it

1216
00:59:33,433 --> 00:59:35,873
* Vibe with it, vibe with it

1217
00:59:37,067 --> 00:59:39,727
- [Rhino] Glad to see you've
made yourself at home.

1218
00:59:39,733 --> 00:59:41,573
- Yeah, thanks.

1219
00:59:41,567 --> 00:59:43,127
- How's Vixen?

1220
00:59:43,133 --> 00:59:44,073
- Sleeping.

1221
00:59:45,067 --> 00:59:46,427
- [Electra] Good.

1222
00:59:48,733 --> 00:59:50,433
- Gotta take care
of a couple things.

1223
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:52,333
You guys stay here and rest.

1224
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:54,173
- What are you gonna do?

1225
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:58,797
- Gotta find Kandy and
see what Andre's up to.

1226
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,800
- You think he saw
you at Vixen's?

1227
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,300
- I don't think so, he
came in pretty late.

1228
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,370
- What about Sabu?

1229
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:06,697
- Andre's been
pretty pissed at him

1230
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,170
lately and after
he scene he caused

1231
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:10,927
at the junkyard
he's probably dead.

1232
01:00:10,933 --> 01:00:13,603
All right, I'll see you later.

1233
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,970
Keep an eye on Vixen,
make sure she rests.

1234
01:00:16,967 --> 01:00:18,597
(mumbles).

1235
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,670
- [Electra] Okay.

1236
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:21,497
Hey Rhino?

1237
01:00:22,433 --> 01:00:24,333
- [Rhino] Yeah.

1238
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:26,603
- [Electra] Thanks
for everything.

1239
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,800
I don't understand how we ever

1240
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,100
ended up on opposite sides.

1241
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,470
- Go where life takes you.

1242
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:36,367
Well, life took me
somewhere I didn't wanna go.

1243
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,703
- Well I'm glad
you're with us now.

1244
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,930
- Yeah, me too.

1245
01:00:42,467 --> 01:00:45,127
* I accept and expect
the whole (mumbles)

1246
01:00:45,133 --> 01:00:48,533
* Inject and collect
without disrespect *

1247
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,200
- [Andre] Where the
hell have you been?

1248
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,670
- Out gathering intel.

1249
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:55,397
Did you hear about what
happened at the junkyard?

1250
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,970
- Yeah, Sabu told
me all about it.

1251
01:00:56,967 --> 01:00:58,527
- Sabu's alive?

1252
01:00:58,533 --> 01:01:00,073
- We had a little
disagreement about whether he

1253
01:01:00,067 --> 01:01:02,797
should've done to the
junkyard without asking me.

1254
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,430
Let's just say I
won that argument.

1255
01:01:04,433 --> 01:01:06,273
- Well I had
everything planned out

1256
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:07,727
and he fucked it up!

1257
01:01:07,733 --> 01:01:09,173
I was gonna bring
you Vixen's head on

1258
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:11,167
a silver platter and he came in,

1259
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,627
showed his ugly face
and started shooting

1260
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:14,273
up the place, I had to bail!

1261
01:01:14,267 --> 01:01:15,497
- I understand.

1262
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,170
Sabu was an arrogant prick,

1263
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:19,267
already failed one
too many times.

1264
01:01:19,267 --> 01:01:20,567
But you?

1265
01:01:20,567 --> 01:01:21,697
You're a smart guy.

1266
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,930
You know your role.

1267
01:01:23,933 --> 01:01:25,073
- Thank you.

1268
01:01:25,067 --> 01:01:26,367
- Thank you.

1269
01:01:26,367 --> 01:01:28,167
Look, we're prepping the drugs

1270
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:29,367
and we're getting
to unleash Hell

1271
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:32,267
on the city at
around four o'clock.

1272
01:01:32,267 --> 01:01:33,767
We're gonna meet at
the same junkyard

1273
01:01:33,767 --> 01:01:35,697
where Sabu fucked everything up.

1274
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,270
Now I expect you'll be there
to help oversee things?

1275
01:01:38,267 --> 01:01:39,567
- It would be my pleasure.

1276
01:01:39,567 --> 01:01:41,597
- Good, now if you'll excuse me,

1277
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,200
I've got some things
to take care of.

1278
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,100
- Yes sir.

1279
01:01:46,233 --> 01:01:47,773
- This is gonna be glorious.

1280
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:49,767
My shining moment.

1281
01:01:49,767 --> 01:01:51,827
Gonna shove my fish so
far up those bitches'

1282
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,933
assess I'm gonna rip
out their fucking heart!

1283
01:01:53,933 --> 01:01:55,073
(phone rings)

1284
01:01:58,567 --> 01:01:59,397
- Hello?

1285
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,300
- Rhino?!

1286
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,500
- Kandy!

1287
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,970
Oh my God, I'm so
glad you're okay!

1288
01:02:02,967 --> 01:02:03,927
I've been calling your phone but

1289
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:05,273
it goes straight to voicemail.

1290
01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:07,127
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.

1291
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:08,433
Is everyone okay?

1292
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,203
- Vixen and Electra are fine.

1293
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,970
Sarita didn't make
it, but we don't

1294
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,467
have time to worry about that.

1295
01:02:13,467 --> 01:02:14,897
Andre's about to
flood the streets with

1296
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,300
dirty drugs and we have
to do something about it.

1297
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,900
- I agree.

1298
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,330
It's time to end this.

1299
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,633
- Great, I have a
plan to sneak us in.

1300
01:02:22,633 --> 01:02:24,733
Meet me outside the junkyard
where we had our meeting.

1301
01:02:24,733 --> 01:02:25,973
- All right, and
hopefully it goes better

1302
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:28,467
than our last meeting
at the junkyard.

1303
01:02:28,467 --> 01:02:30,497
All right, bye.

1304
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:38,400
(soft beat rap melody)

1305
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:43,800
- You okay?

1306
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:48,397
- Where is Rhino?

1307
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,470
- Went to go see what
Andre's planning.

1308
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:53,267
Then he's gonna look for Kandy.

1309
01:02:53,267 --> 01:02:55,497
- How long has he been gone?

1310
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,400
- A few hours.

1311
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,500
- He hasn't checked back in?

1312
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,900
- I haven't heard from
him since he left.

1313
01:03:06,267 --> 01:03:07,097
Whoa.

1314
01:03:10,367 --> 01:03:12,127
- Where's your phone?

1315
01:03:13,533 --> 01:03:14,633
(phone rings)

1316
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:17,197
- Hello?

1317
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,930
- Rhino, have you
found Kandy yet?

1318
01:03:18,933 --> 01:03:21,133
- Yeah, she's fine.

1319
01:03:21,133 --> 01:03:22,133
- Oh good.

1320
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:24,403
Both of you need
to get back here

1321
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,900
so we can plan our next move.

1322
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,630
- No, you and
Electra stay there.

1323
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:29,333
I'll take care of everything.

1324
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:32,333
It's gonna be all right, you
should stay there and rest.

1325
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:33,703
- What are you gonna do?

1326
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,600
What are you talking about?

1327
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,070
- What I should've
done a long time ago.

1328
01:03:38,067 --> 01:03:39,367
I love you, Vixen.

1329
01:03:39,367 --> 01:03:40,867
And I always will.

1330
01:03:40,867 --> 01:03:41,897
- What?

1331
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:42,730
Rhino!

1332
01:03:46,067 --> 01:03:47,097
(sobs) Rhino!

1333
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:50,467
- What's wrong?

1334
01:03:50,467 --> 01:03:52,927
Vixen, what did he say?

1335
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:53,933
- He's gone.

1336
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,800
- What do you mean?

1337
01:03:58,233 --> 01:04:02,133
- He's trying to save me
like he's always done.

1338
01:04:03,933 --> 01:04:05,273
I never let him.

1339
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:08,967
You know I didn't want this.

1340
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:10,267
- I know.

1341
01:04:10,267 --> 01:04:13,897
You just wanted what
was best for all of us.

1342
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,070
- When I was a
kid, I had to watch

1343
01:04:16,067 --> 01:04:20,327
both my parents struggle
to make ends meet.

1344
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:23,103
My dad worked 80 hour weeks just

1345
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,330
to put a roof over our heads.

1346
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:28,933
When I was 10, he lost his job.

1347
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:34,727
We were already behind on
rent, the car, everything.

1348
01:04:36,267 --> 01:04:38,367
He couldn't take it.

1349
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:39,697
He shot himself.

1350
01:04:41,533 --> 01:04:44,173
I lost both my parents that day.

1351
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:48,327
My mom was still alive, but
inside she left with dad.

1352
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:54,927
She took care of us,
but she wasn't the same.

1353
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:59,697
As soon as we all left
the house, she died.

1354
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,500
(snaps fingers)

1355
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,070
Like that.

1356
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:07,467
It was like she was
waiting for us to be okay.

1357
01:05:07,467 --> 01:05:08,967
- Vixen, I never knew.

1358
01:05:08,967 --> 01:05:10,527
I'm sorry.

1359
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:14,803
- I told myself that I would
never struggle like that.

1360
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,500
That when I grew up,
I'd make them proud.

1361
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,630
This wasn't the path that
I was supposed to take.

1362
01:05:21,633 --> 01:05:25,373
Rhino tried to tell me
that, but I never listened.

1363
01:05:25,367 --> 01:05:29,427
I just pushed him away
and look where we are now.

1364
01:05:30,967 --> 01:05:32,127
Never again!

1365
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,500
I'm gonna finish
this and I'm done.

1366
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:42,070
You, me, all of us are
meant for so much more.

1367
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:44,667
It's time we live up
to our full potential.

1368
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,127
- All right.

1369
01:05:46,133 --> 01:05:48,073
So what's the plan?

1370
01:05:48,067 --> 01:05:51,427
- Let me make a phone
call, and then we ride.

1371
01:05:51,433 --> 01:05:53,433
* Feels like I'm losing my mind

1372
01:05:53,433 --> 01:05:54,933
* All of my life

1373
01:05:54,933 --> 01:05:56,833
* I've been helping
you get yours

1374
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:59,073
* Think it's time
for me to get mine

1375
01:05:59,067 --> 01:06:00,627
* All of my life

1376
01:06:00,633 --> 01:06:02,603
* It seems I've gotten
(mumbles) in line

1377
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,500
* Feels like I'm losing my mind

1378
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,070
* All of my life

1379
01:06:06,067 --> 01:06:08,067
* I've been helping
you get yours

1380
01:06:08,067 --> 01:06:09,797
* I think it's time
for me to get mine *

1381
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,470
- All right, before
we go any further,

1382
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,897
what happened to Sarita?

1383
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,570
- Andre and his men
ambushed us as Vixen's.

1384
01:06:16,567 --> 01:06:19,927
She made sure we all got out,
without her we'd all be dead.

1385
01:06:19,933 --> 01:06:23,773
She sacrificed herself
without any hesitation.

1386
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:26,597
- I should've been there.

1387
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,500
- No, you're here now and
that's all that matters.

1388
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:33,503
- All right, so what's the plan?

1389
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,970
- We're gonna sneak in there and

1390
01:06:34,967 --> 01:06:37,667
take these motherfuckers
out once and for all.

1391
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:39,167
- You sure this is gonna work?

1392
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:40,567
- It should work long enough for

1393
01:06:40,567 --> 01:06:43,367
us to blow the top off
this whole fucking thing.

1394
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:45,467
- All right, let's do this.

1395
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:47,067
- [Phantom] (low distortion)
This is The Phantom.

1396
01:06:47,067 --> 01:06:48,427
Your payment will
be in my personal

1397
01:06:48,433 --> 01:06:50,573
attache case which I'll provide.

1398
01:06:50,567 --> 01:06:54,527
Don't fuck this up, Andre!

1399
01:06:59,067 --> 01:06:59,867
(snorting)

1400
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:04,173
Woo!

1401
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,670
Yeah!

1402
01:07:06,667 --> 01:07:08,327
(laughing)

1403
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:17,203
(remixed rap music melody)

1404
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:22,700
- All right.

1405
01:07:24,267 --> 01:07:32,627
Got it!

1406
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,470
- If everything goes
according to plan,

1407
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:39,527
Vixen and her crew will be dead

1408
01:07:39,533 --> 01:07:41,103
by the end of the day.

1409
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:44,500
Sweet (mumbles)
revenge will be mine.

1410
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,330
- That's right.
(chuckling)

1411
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,470
- Rhino, this place is
crawling with crooks.

1412
01:07:55,467 --> 01:07:57,327
You sure this is gonna work?

1413
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:58,733
- Here's my plan.

1414
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:01,573
- Really?

1415
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:09,070
All right, we're going
home in trash bags.

1416
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:14,927
- Hey you!

1417
01:08:14,933 --> 01:08:16,073
- Who me?

1418
01:08:16,067 --> 01:08:17,697
- No, the 10,000
assholes behind you.

1419
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,400
What are you doing here?

1420
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,330
- I work for Andre.

1421
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:22,533
Come on.

1422
01:08:22,533 --> 01:08:24,303
- Yeah, we're just here
to see Andre is all.

1423
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,170
- Rhino.
- He told us to just come by.

1424
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:28,067
(gunshot)

1425
01:08:28,967 --> 01:08:30,627
(music intensifies)

1426
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,330
* It has begun
* It has begun

1427
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:39,173
* Our moment in the sun
* Our moment in the sun

1428
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:40,927
- Oh what fun.

1429
01:08:40,933 --> 01:08:42,373
(laughing)

1430
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,167
- Boss, shooting on
the West perimeter.

1431
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:46,067
- I know, that's
Rhino and his sister.

1432
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:49,567
Go take care of it.

1433
01:08:53,567 --> 01:08:54,727
- We're gonna take
these assholes

1434
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:56,503
out once and for all.

1435
01:08:58,733 --> 01:08:59,903
- Rhino?

1436
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,730
So nice of you and
your sister to join us!

1437
01:09:01,733 --> 01:09:03,673
I thought you gonna
miss the whole party!

1438
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:05,297
Still, I'm a little disappointed

1439
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,770
your friends couldn't make it.

1440
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:09,497
But hey, the night's young.

1441
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,570
- Wouldn't act so cocky, Andre!

1442
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:13,397
- You're outmanned
and outgunned.

1443
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,130
I think we all
know how this ends.

1444
01:09:15,133 --> 01:09:40,103
Good for me, very bad for you.

1445
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,430
(gunfire)

1446
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:49,297
(laughing)

1447
01:09:49,867 --> 01:09:52,127
- Mazel tov, son
of a biscuit eater.

1448
01:09:52,133 --> 01:09:53,503
- Vixen!

1449
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,230
- Backup has arrived.

1450
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,370
- Andre, what are we gonna do,

1451
01:09:57,367 --> 01:09:59,097
they got all our guards,
we're surrounded!

1452
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:07,800
(gunshot)

1453
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:13,697
- [Vixen] Hey Andre!

1454
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:18,730
You missing something?

1455
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,603
- Shit.

1456
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,330
(rock music)

1457
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:34,433
* I heard the news,
the king is gone

1458
01:10:34,433 --> 01:10:36,973
* He got rolled
up by the Vietcong

1459
01:10:36,967 --> 01:10:40,197
* He was the king of
the slot car track

1460
01:10:42,767 --> 01:10:46,167
* Now I'm the king
of the slot car track

1461
01:10:49,867 --> 01:10:52,297
- (mumbles) your
little spic friend.

1462
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,170
She killed a bunch of my
whores with this knife.

1463
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:57,497
Gonna be appropriate
to gut you with it.

1464
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,330
(groaning)

1465
01:10:59,733 --> 01:11:01,073
Damn it!

1466
01:11:01,867 --> 01:11:05,197
* Now I'm the king
of the slot car track

1467
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:11,067
* Yeah I'm the king
of the slot car track

1468
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,170
* Yes I'm the king of
the slot car track *

1469
01:11:21,633 --> 01:11:25,503
(loud explosion)

1470
01:11:30,067 --> 01:11:30,827
(gunshot)

1471
01:11:32,067 --> 01:11:33,867
- Kandy!

1472
01:11:38,467 --> 01:11:39,297
- Fuck.

1473
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,200
- No!

1474
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,400
He's mine.

1475
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,527
You killed my sister,
you motherfucker!

1476
01:11:46,533 --> 01:11:48,733
- Are you gonna
shoot me from behind?

1477
01:11:48,733 --> 01:11:50,603
You gonna shoot me from behind?

1478
01:11:50,600 --> 01:12:04,070
Be a man, motherfucker!

1479
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:16,173
(gunfire)

1480
01:12:20,533 --> 01:12:21,973
- [Vixen] Kandy?!

1481
01:12:26,433 --> 01:12:27,873
Oh God!

1482
01:12:27,867 --> 01:12:29,667
- Vixen, just promise me you'll

1483
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:31,597
stop with all of this, okay?

1484
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,430
The drugs, the killing,
just stop, please just stop.

1485
01:12:35,433 --> 01:12:37,903
- I promise I'll stop.

1486
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,130
- [Kandy] Good.

1487
01:12:40,367 --> 01:12:42,697
That's all I wanted to hear.

1488
01:12:45,533 --> 01:12:55,073
- No, Kandy.

1489
01:12:59,267 --> 01:13:00,797
- The death meth has been taken

1490
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,270
off the streets and destroyed.

1491
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:07,967
Most of the gangs were killed in

1492
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:11,127
a shootout on Crazy
Pete's Auto Yard.

1493
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:13,173
There's one member
of the gang left.

1494
01:13:13,167 --> 01:13:14,097
He escaped.

1495
01:13:15,367 --> 01:13:17,497
They're trying to find him.

1496
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,270
And we're gonna find him.

1497
01:13:19,267 --> 01:13:20,627
I promise.

1498
01:13:20,633 --> 01:13:21,833
- [Voiceover] Officer
Jennettie, one question please.

1499
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,073
How do you address
the rumor that you

1500
01:13:23,067 --> 01:13:24,367
were aiding these
women, they were your

1501
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:26,897
own personal
vigilante hit squad?

1502
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,070
- No comments.

1503
01:13:28,067 --> 01:13:29,367
- [Voiceover] Officer Jennettie,

01:13:44,067 --> 01:13:44,827
Hello?

1511
01:13:46,233 --> 01:13:47,373
What?!

1512
01:13:47,367 --> 01:13:48,527
That scumbag?!

1513
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,530
No, we're on our way!

1514
01:13:51,533 --> 01:13:53,303
We gotta go.

1515
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:57,330
- (mumbles) what
the fuck is that?

1516
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:03,727
- What are you doing?

1517
01:14:03,733 --> 01:14:06,503
Stop texting, they're behind us!

1518
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:41,970
(dramatic rock music)

1519
01:14:46,467 --> 01:15:20,067
No, really?!

1520
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:42,100
Shit!

1521
01:15:46,567 --> 01:15:55,467
We're fucked!

1522
01:16:00,067 --> 01:16:00,797
(laughing)

1523
01:16:01,967 --> 01:16:02,797
(gunshot)

1524
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,630
Ow!

1525
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,900
God!

1526
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,870
You think I'm sorry I
killed all your friends?!

1527
01:16:10,867 --> 01:16:13,127
- No, but I'll make you sorry.

1528
01:16:13,133 --> 01:16:15,133
- Oh like hell you will!

1529
01:16:16,433 --> 01:16:18,073
See this town?

1530
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:19,397
That's mine!

1531
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,400
- You know, it didn't
have to be like this.

1532
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,200
We could've worked together.

1533
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,170
But you had to have it all.

1534
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:27,067
- I owe a little on
my American Express,

1535
01:16:27,067 --> 01:16:29,727
I'm behind on the rent.

1536
01:16:33,533 --> 01:16:37,533
- By the end of this
jingle, you better kill me.

1537
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,400
Kill me if you can.

1538
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,770
* But the fact still remain
there will be no respect

1539
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:46,367

01:16:46,367 --> 01:16:48,097
* Got the problem,

1541
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,770
* So let's get in the
right place and never exit

1542
01:16:50,767 --> 01:16:53,597
* To find inner peace need
war to find peace to rest in

1543
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,070
* Won't be known for
sitting next to my throne

1544
01:16:56,067 --> 01:16:59,067

this whole road alone

01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:00,267
* All of my life

1546
01:17:00,267 --> 01:17:02,067
* Seems like I've
been waiting in line

1547
01:17:02,067 --> 01:17:04,067
* Feels like I'm losing my mind

1548
01:17:04,067 --> 01:17:05,497

01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,630
* I've been helping
you get yours

1550
01:17:07,633 --> 01:17:09,673
* Think it's time
for me to get mine

1551
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,127
* All of my life

1552
01:17:11,133 --> 01:17:13,233
* Seems I've gotten way in line

1553
01:17:13,233 --> 01:17:15,203

1559
01:17:29,133 --> 01:17:30,503
(gunshot)

1560
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,170
(groaning)

1561
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,700
- You think I've lost?!

1562
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,930
It ain't over until
the black lady sings!

1563
01:17:41,933 --> 01:17:42,773
Surprise!

1564
01:17:43,733 --> 01:17:45,273
(laughing)

1565
01:17:45,267 --> 01:17:46,267

1566
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:49,367
- Run!

1567
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:52,067
- Oh my God, are you okay?

Are you okay?

1569
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:58,830
- I always wanted a sister
that I could molest.

1570
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:03,670
- [Voiceover]
Don't, please don't.

1571
01:18:03,667 --> 01:18:04,497
Oh no!

1572

Hey Ashley, you want
