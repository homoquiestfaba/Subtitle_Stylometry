00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:50,871
My name's Ralph and I'm a bad guy

3
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:54,830
Ah.. Let's see
I'm 9 feet tall

4
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:59,592
I weigh 643 pounds
Got a little bit of a temper on me

5
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,983
Hey, you moved my stump!

6
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:06,241
My passion bubbles very
near the surface, I guess..

7
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:07,855
I'm not gonna lie

8
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:10,537
Anywho.. what else?
Aaah...

9
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:14,316
I'm a wrecker I wreck things

10
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:16,976
Professionally I'm gonna wreck it!

11
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,488
I mean, I'm very good at what I do
Probably the best I know

12
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:26,113
The thing is, Fixing is the name of
the game Literally, Fix-It Felix, Jr.

13
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,600
I can fix it!

14
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:33,354
So, ya.. naturally the guy with the name
Fix-it Felix is the good guy

15
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:37,271
He's nice enough as good guys go
Definitely fixes stuff really well..

16
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:43,688
but,.. aah.. if you got a magic hammer
from your father, how hard can it be?

17
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,883
If he was a regular contractor..
carpenter guy

18
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:51,347
I guarantee you, you would not be able
to fix the damage that I do.. as quickly

19
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:55,309
And when Felix does a good job
He gets a medal

20
00:01:55,648 --> 00:02:02,451
But are there medals for wrecking stuff
really well? To that I say HAAH!!

21
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:05,561
And no... there aren't

22
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:08,547
- So cool..
- This animation is so real

23
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:10,511
30 years I've been doing this

24
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:13,906
And I've seen a lot other games
come and go.. kinda sad

25
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:18,030
Think about all those guys from Asteroids?
...Boom!! ..gone..

26
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:21,482
Centipede??
Who knows where that guy is.. you know

27
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:25,286
Look a steady arcade game is nothing
to sneeze at I'm very lucky

28
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,049
It's just.. I got to say:

29
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:33,673
It becomes kinda hard to love your job
when no one seems to like you for doing it

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,344
All clear..
The Arcade's closed!

31
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:45,734
Woo.. what a day.
So, you wanna head to Tappers, Ken?

32
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,727
If you're buyin' buddy

33
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:53,326
Quittin' time!

34
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:10,305
I donno.. Maybe I won't be feeling this
way if things were different after work

35
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:13,550
But.. it is what it is.
- Good job, everyone!

36
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:17,409
Felix and the Nicelanders
go hang out in their homes..

37
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:20,075
which he just fixed and very..you know

38
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:27,594
They go to their homes, I go to mine..
which happens to be.. a dump

39
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:33,414
And when I say a dump I don't mean like
a shabby palce, I mean an actual dump

40
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:36,174
Where the garbage goes
and a bunch of bricks

41
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,899
and smashed building parts.. that's..

42
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:42,017
That's what I call home.

43
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,213
I guess I can't bellyache too much
without my bricks, without my stump.

44
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:52,642
It looks uncomfortable
it's actually fine

45
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:54,643
I'm good

46
00:03:57,454 --> 00:04:02,275
But..
if I'm really honest with myself

47
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,823
I see Felix up there..
getting patted on the back..

48
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:11,170
people are giving him pie..
thanking him and..

49
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:16,678
so happy to see him all the time..
Sometime to think..

50
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:22,983
Man!.. Sure must be nice
being the good guy

51
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:28,515
Nice share, Ralph. As fellow
bad guys we've all felt

52
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:31,992
what you're feeling and
we've come to terms with it

53
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:36,799
Really?
- Right here, I'm Zangief, I'm bad guy!

54
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:40,581
I relate to you Ralph When I hit bottom

55
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:45,587
I was crushing man skull
like sparrow egg between my thighs

56
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:49,287
And I think, why you
have to be so bad Zangief?

57
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,940
Why can't you be more like good guy?

58
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:54,813
Then I have moment of clarity

59
00:04:54,848 --> 00:05:01,131
If Zangief is good guy.. who'll crush man
skull like sparrow's egg between thighs?

60
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:07,799
And I say, Zangief, you are bad guy,
but this does not mean you are bad guy.

61
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:12,724
Right, I'm sorry. I
just..You lost me there.

62
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:15,676
- Zombie, bad guy.

63
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,510
Zangief saying:
Labels not make you happy

64
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:22,835
Good...
Bad....

65
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:24,944
You must love you

66
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,192
Yea.. inside here!

67
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:29,217
Whoa, whoa ..ok oh!
alright ..I get you..

68
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:31,786
Watch out, it's dripping
- Question, Ralph

69
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:34,910
We've been asking you
to BAD-ANON for years

70
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:38,033
now and tonight you..
you finally show up

71
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:41,181
Why is that?
- I donno, I just felt like coming

72
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:44,945
I mean, I suppose it has something
to do with the fact that.. uh..

73
00:05:45,857 --> 00:05:48,768
Well.. today is the 30th Anniversary
of my game

74
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:52,010
Happy Anniversary, Ralph
- Thanks, Satan.

75
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:55,503
Err,. it's Satine, actually
- Got it!

76
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:57,844
But here's the thing..

77
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:01,932
I don't wanna be the bad guy anymore

78
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:09,618
You can't mess with the program Ralph.
- You're not going Turbo, are you?

79
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:13,116
Turbo? No, I'm not going Turbo
C'mon guys!!

80
00:06:13,117 --> 00:06:15,529
Is it Turbo who don't want a friend?
Or a medal?

81
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,940
or a piece of pie every once in a while?

82
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:20,620
Is it Turbo who want more out of life?
- Yess...

83
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:23,592
Ralph, Ralph.. we get it!

84
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:27,140
But we can't change who we are
And the sooner you accept that...

85
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,228
..the better off your game
and your life will be.

86
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:33,894
Hey, one game at a time, Ralph

87
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:36,875
Now let's close out with the
Bad Guy Affirmation

88
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:46,071
I am bad, and that's good
I will never be good

89
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:51,097
And that's not bad
There's no one I'd rather be than me

90
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:53,657
Ok guys, see you next week

91
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:58,746
Hang in therel, Ralph.
- Hey Zombie, don't forget your hatchet

92
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:00,933
There you go

93
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:40,561
Welcome to Game Central Station.

95
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,936
Step aside sir, random security check

96
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:06,033
Random my behind, you always stop me!

97
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:08,128
- I'm just a sarge for tech
and doing my job, sir.

98
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:10,154
Name?
- Lara Croft.

99
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,884
Name?
- Wreck-It Ralph.

100
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:14,702
And, where you're coming from?
- Uh... Pacman.

101
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,735
You bringing any fruit with you?
- No.

102
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:19,078
No, no fruit.
- Ok then, where you headin?

103
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,630
Uh.. Fix-it Felix Jr.
- Anything to declare?

104
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:23,497
I hate you
- I get that a lot.

105
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:25,041
Proceed.

106
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:30,031
Bad guy coming..

107
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:35,654
If you leave your game
stay safe, stay alert..

108
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:38,083
and whatever you do..
don't die..

109
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:42,779
Because if you die outside your own game
you don't regenerate ever

110
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,170
Game over.

111
00:08:53,414 --> 00:08:55,411
Here you go, buddy

112
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,937
It's fresh.
It's straight from Pacman's

113
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:00,365
Hang in there, guys

114
00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:03,763
Name?
- Argggghhhh!!!

115
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:39,970
Happy 30th Anniversary

116
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:42,775
They're having a party without me

117
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,583
Pacman? They invited Pacman?!!
That cherry

118
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:52,082
chasing dot muncher
isin't even on this game

119
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:55,162
Great party, Felix
- Why.. thank you, friend

120
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:57,953
Felix... you're needed
on the dance floor

121
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:12,453
Oh! I bet that's Mario
Fashionaby late, for the norm

122
00:10:12,454 --> 00:10:14,746
I'll get it, Felix.

123
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:21,528
It's Ralph.

124
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,651
He'll wreck the party.
- Get rid of him, Felix.

125
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:29,587
Oh right! I'll go talk to him
Carry on everyone

126
00:10:31,385 --> 00:10:34,070
Ralph, can I help you?

127
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:37,150
Hey Felix. Just wanted to check
on you I saw a big, uh..

128
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:40,195
explosion or something
over the building there

129
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:44,438
Oh.. That was our.. just fireworks
- Fireworks, okay

130
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:50,269
Somebody's birthday.. or?
- Well... it's.. more of an anniversary

131
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:55,219
The 30th Anniversary of our game, actually
- What? is that today?

132
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,983

00:10:57,984 --> 00:11:03,281
Anyway.. uh..Congratulations!
- Thank you, Ralph.. and to you too.

134
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:14,724
Uh, just the heads up Felix They're

135
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:16,729
Hey, Glenn!

00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,757
Cake..Heard about this cake stuff

137
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,728
Never had it. No one ever
seem to throw it out so I..

138
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:26,569
it never, never ends up in the dump,
I never actually tasted it

139
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,021
I always wanted to try cake

140
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:34,815
I don't suppose you'd like to
come in have a slice? would you?

141
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:37,567
Hello, everybody

142
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:46,669

Big Gene!

He's just here for a slice of cake

148
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,654
- And, am a big part of the
game technically speaking

149
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,875
Uh. Why are you here, Gene?

150
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:07,472

Oh and look, there's

153
00:12:15,726 --> 00:12:18,562

Your Woods, is red velvet

Umm.. what.. what's the flavor of
that mud that I'm stuck in there

158
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:36,875
Hm? Oh.. Chocolate
- Never been real fond of chocolate

159
00:12:37,076 --> 00:12:39,255
Well, I did not know that

160
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:41,433
- One other little thing,
I hate to be picky but..

161
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:44,842
you know this angry little
guy here would might be a

162
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:48,249
lot happier if you put him
up here with everyone else

163
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,522
See that? Look at that smile

164
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:54,793
- No, no no.. You see Ralph,
there is no room for you up here

165
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,366
Well what about this we can make room

166
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,864
Here, we can take turn..
Easy!

167
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,867
How about.. we just eat the cake?
- Hang on!

168
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:08,950
Felix needs to be on the roof because
he's about to get his medal

169
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:12,619
Well, how about we just take that medal
and give it to Ralph for once.

170
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,125
Would that be the end of the world Gene?
- Now you're just being ridiculous

171
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:20,415
Only good guys win medals
and you, sir .. are no good guy

172
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,302
I could be a good guy if I wanted to
And I could win a medal

173
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,821
Uh huh? and when you do
come and talk to us

174
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:29,286
- And then would you finally let me
be on top of the cake with you guys?

175
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:32,134
If you win a medal We'll let you
live up here in the Penthouse

176
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:37,496
But it will never happen because you're
just the bad guy who wrecks the building

177
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:40,427
No, I'm not
- Yes, you are.

178
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:43,149
No, I'm not!!!

179
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,635
Yes, you are

180
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:59,687
Alright, Gene, you know what?
I'm gonna win a medal

181
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:05,182
Oh I am gonna win a medal The shiniest
medal this place has ever seen

182
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:11,096
A medal that will be so good that it
will make Felix's medals wet their pants

183
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:14,371
And goodnight Thank you for the party

184
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,318
Is he serious?

185
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:19,481
- Oh please..where is a bad
guy gonna win a medal?

186
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:21,578
Of course he's not serious

187
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:24,732
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life

188
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:29,053
That's why I came straight here Tapper
You never give me a bum steer now..

189
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:32,278
C'mon.. where can a guy like me
go and win a medal

190
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,076
I don't think such a game exist, Ralph

191
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:36,787
Oh c'mon.. You know people,
there's gotta be..

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,095
Okay! As you were saying?
- I was saying...

195
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:52,851
I can't spent another 30
years living alone in

00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:55,506
the garbage I'm not going
back without a medal

197
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:59,286
Well, I don't know what to tell you
Maybe somebody left a medal here

198
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:01,740
You're welcome to take tour

I'll fix it

294
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:13,711
Oh my reend! where is he?

295
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,450
Mister Litwak.
- What's the trouble sweetheart

296
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:19,118
The game's busted

297
00:22:19,902 --> 00:22:23,086

298
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:27,370
Oh boy, looks like the game's

00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:29,610
Sorry sweetie, here's your quarter back

300
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:33,261
But what about the game?
- I'll have someone look at it tomorrow

301
00:22:33,262 --> 00:22:35,581
But if he can't fix it,
it might be time to

302
00:22:35,582 --> 00:22:37,899
put old Ralph and Felix out the pastures

303
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,336
..like my nana

304
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:53,197
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are Out of Order

305
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:56,131
- Sweet mercy, without
Ralph, we are doomed

306
00:22:56,132 --> 00:22:58,713
They're gonna pull our plug

307
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:03,276
Okay, everybody calm down..

308
00:23:03,277 --> 00:23:07,096
Ralph probably fell asleep in
the washroom of Tappers again

309
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:09,577
See?
There he is now

310
00:23:14,763 --> 00:23:17,744
Why.. it's Q*Bert.
What brings you here, neighbour?

311
00:23:19,962 --> 00:23:24,201
What's he saying, Felix?
- Standby, my Q*Bertee is a little rusty

312
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:41,455
Ralph's gone Turbo!!

313
00:23:56,846 --> 00:23:58,318

325
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:51,858
- Never heard of him.

326
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:58,709
Well..Q*Bert saw him come in here
- Impossible, nothing gets past me

327
00:24:59,343 --> 00:25:01,010
That came from the tower

328
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:22,120

00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:25,654

00:26:18,467 --> 00:26:21,713
The living embodyment of
all these core represents

00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:27,426
Bravery, integrity,
grace under pressure...

340

and above all... dignity

Oh.. No!!

This is a candy go-cart game
over by the Wack-a Mole

347
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:15,075

00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,810
- Lying to a child

387
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,476
Shame on you Ralph

388
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,440
- But, I wasn't lying about
the medal, that is my medal

389
00:30:48,975 --> 00:30:51,626
That's why I was climbing the tree..
It's mine, it's my

390
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:56,042
It's precious to me, that thing is this..

391
00:30:56,143 --> 00:30:58,453
Yea, well, now it's my tic-ket

00:30:58,488 --> 00:31:00,339

I will find you

395
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:09,290
Nowhere to hide

396
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:14,032
Yea, banged around in here
like some kind of hot

397
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:17,045
shot Then he went barreling
down into that..

398
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:20,605
sweet little game like a crazy person
- Sugar Rush.

399
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,580
Cy-Bugs would chew up
that game faster than a

400
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,362
chicken hawk can a coop
of crippled roosters

401
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:28,753
What was that now?
- What are you, a fig?

402
00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:34,200
There was a Cy-Bug on that shuttle
Do you even khow what a Cy-Bug is?

403
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:38,383
I can't say that I do, ma'am
- Cy-Bugs are like a virus

404
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:40,708
They don't know they're in a game
All they know is...

405
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:44,510
eat, kill, multiply
Without a beacon to stop them

406
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:48,126
..they'll consume Sugar Rush
- But you think they'll stop there?

407
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:49,838
Yes!
- Wrong!

408
00:31:49,938 --> 00:31:52,522
Viruses do not stop

409
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,362
Once those Cy-Bugs finish
off Sugar Rush..

410
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:58,759
..they'll invade every other game
until this Arcade is..

411
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:03,257
nothing but a smoking husk
of forgotten dreams

412
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:06,363
Kohut, my cruiser.

413
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:13,495
Sheepers, is she always this intense?
- It's not her fault

414
00:32:13,754 --> 00:32:17,204
She's programmed with
the most tragic backstory ever

415
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:20,078
One day she didn't do a perimeter check

416
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:22,638
Her wedding day

417
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:40,431
Wait, ma'am.
I'm going with you

418
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:45,151
Like fun you are short stack You die
outside your game, you don't regenerate

419
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:47,770
Well, neither do you, ma'am

420
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,156
And it is my job to fix
what Ralph wrecks

421
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:54,949
And I cannot ask you
to risk your life cleaning up his mess

422
00:32:54,984 --> 00:32:58,823
No flex on this one ma'am
I am coming along with you

423
00:33:36,062 --> 00:33:40,157
Citizens of Sugar Rush.

424
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:41,604
Just in time

425
00:33:42,316 --> 00:33:45,732
All hail, our rightful ruler

426
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,906
King Candy.

427
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:51,372
Hallo, my loyal subjects

And thank you to today's avatars
It was a wonderful day of racing

431
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:09,623
It was.. but now the Arcade
is closed so it's time to

432
00:34:09,624 --> 00:34:13,623
wipe the slate clean and race
to decide our new avatars

433
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,334
The first 9 racers to
cross that finish line

434
00:34:18,335 --> 00:34:21,857
will represent Sugar Rush
as tomorrow's avatar

435
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:25,792
Race, race, race, race

00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,548
Everything's alright
The monster's been caught.

471
00:36:55,583 --> 00:37:01,844
We'll repair all the damage Don't worry we
will have our race before the Arcade opens

472
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:04,103
And I'm in it

473
00:37:09,202 --> 00:37:12,680

You game jumped? Ralph!

493
00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:34,017

to my kingdom and take over my game..
you've got another thing coming...

495
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,353
Easy! Your Puffyness

496
00:38:38,453 --> 00:38:42,058
It's not my fault one of your children
of the candy corn stole my medal

497
00:38:42,093 --> 00:38:45,063
Children of the candy corn?
Who...?

498
00:38:45,163 --> 00:38:49,982
The glitch... the coin she used to buy her
way into the race, that was your medal?

499
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:52,296
She did what?
I need that back

500
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:54,978
Well, I'm afraid I can't help you,.
it's gone

501
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:57,558
you know, it's.. it's
nothing but code now

502
00:38:58,123 --> 00:39:02,161
and it will stay that way until someone
wins the cup at the end of the race

503
00:39:02,428 --> 00:39:05,811
Well, maybe I'll just have to have
a little talk with the winner then

504
00:39:05,896 --> 00:39:07,762
Is that a threat I smell?

505
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:12,276
Bwlaaah..beyond..halitosis is so
obviously you're suffering from

506
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:15,935

508
00:39:17,768 --> 00:39:20,617
Wynnchel, Duncan,
carry him out of that cupcake

509
00:39:20,717 --> 00:39:24,882
And on the first train back home And if I
ever see you here again Wreck-It Ralph...

510
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:27,580
..I'll lock you in my Fungeon

511
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,204
Fungeon?

512
00:39:30,205 --> 00:39:32,542
- Fun-dungeon? You know,
it's a play-on words?

513
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,687
It's a Fu..
Never mind

514
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:37,986
Now, I got a glitch to deal with
thanks to you

515
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:41,802
Goodbye, Wreck-It Ralph.
It hasn't been a pleasure.

516
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,314
It's hard as a rock
- I can see that

517
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:49,835
Get the tools
- What tools?

518
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:50,926
Quiet you!

519
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,438
What?? No!
- Take it easy big boy

520
00:39:55,473 --> 00:39:57,351
Stay away from me
- He's getting away

521
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:04,816
Quick, call out the Devil-dogs

522
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:23,633
Chocolate I hate chocolate

523
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,168
I gotta get my medal back

524
00:40:31,246 --> 00:40:33,423
The pot goes to the winning racer

525
00:40:33,524 --> 00:40:36,147
Hey kids, can I talk to you for a second?

526
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:48,628
Hello, fellow racers

527
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:51,003
It's that little crumb snatcher

528
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:54,291
Candlehead, Taffyta, Rancis
you're looking well

529
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,900
Came by to check out
the competition, huh?

530
00:40:56,935 --> 00:41:02,544
Well, here it is the Lickety Split
- Jeez, looks like she built it herself

531
00:41:02,549 --> 00:41:03,495
Built it myself

532
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:07,308
Fastest pedal power west to
the Wack-a-Mole Check her out

533
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:16,016
Oh..Vanellope
It's so.. you

534
00:41:16,117 --> 00:41:19,249
But.. you have to back out of the race

535
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,222
Oh no, I.. I don't, you know
cause I..i paid my fee...

536
00:41:23,322 --> 00:41:26,658
and I'm on the board
So, ya.. I'm definitely racing

537
00:41:26,744 --> 00:41:29,700
Ya, well.. King Candy says
glitches can't race

538
00:41:29,735 --> 00:41:33,204
I'm not a glitch, Taffyta
Just got pixlexie, okay

539
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:35,804
The rules are there for
a reason, Vanellope

540
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,363
To protect us

541
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:40,092
Say, I'm you..
I'm in my weird little car..

542
00:41:40,192 --> 00:41:44,199
and I'm driving and..
actually feel kinda cool for once..

543
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:48,909
and then all of a sudden.. oh no..
I'm gli..gli..gli..gli... glitching

544
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,713
See, you're an accident
just waiting to happen

545
00:41:52,714 --> 00:41:55,209
- Oh no, I gli..
gli..gli..gli..glitch too

546
00:41:55,551 --> 00:41:57,615
Oh hey hey, what are you doing?
- Uncool

547
00:41:58,081 --> 00:42:01,487
Stop. You're breaking it

548
00:42:02,441 --> 00:42:05,700
Please, I just wanna race like you guys

549
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:09,464
You will never be a racer
because you're a glitch

550
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:11,591
And that's all you'll ever be

551
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,741
Hey.. leave her alone

552
00:42:18,613 --> 00:42:20,290
Let's get out of here

553
00:42:25,621 --> 00:42:29,336
Scram, you rotten little cavities
before I throw you in a mud

554
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,552
What are you looking at?

555
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:42,065
You're welcome, you rotten little thief
- I'm not a thief

556
00:42:42,188 --> 00:42:44,583
I just borrowed your
stupid coin I was gonna

557
00:42:44,584 --> 00:42:46,977
give it back to you as
soon as I won the race

558
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,863
It's not a coin It is a medal

559
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:54,176
Coin, medal.. whatever... just go back to
your own dumb game and win another one

560
00:42:54,177 --> 00:42:58,652
I can't, I didn't win it in my game
I won it in Hero's Duty.

561
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,752
Hero's Duty?

562
00:43:03,253 --> 00:43:04,857
It's not that kind of duty

563
00:43:04,913 --> 00:43:09,376
I bet you really get a 'watch where you
step' in a game called Hero's Duty?

564
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:12,992
What'd you won the medal for, wiping??

565
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:17,609
I hope you wash your hands
after you handle that medal..

566
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:18,987
Listen..
- One more, one more

567
00:43:19,023 --> 00:43:22,001
Why did the Hero flush the toilet?

568
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,643
Say 'why?'
- Why?

569
00:43:24,678 --> 00:43:27,241
Because it was his 'duty'!

570
00:43:27,242 --> 00:43:29,804
- How dare you insult Hero's
Duty, you little girlsnipe!

571
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,976
I earned that medal You better get
it back for me, too schweetz sister

572
00:43:34,077 --> 00:43:36,859
Well unless you've got
a go-cart hidden in

573
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,640
the back-folds of your
neck, I can't help it

574
00:43:45,236 --> 00:43:47,449
What a moron...

575
00:43:47,484 --> 00:43:52,077
Hey, genius..that's a jaw-breaker
You're never gonna...

576
00:43:57,705 --> 00:44:02,032
Enjoy your little tantrum day, poor baby?
- Leave me alone

577
00:44:02,491 --> 00:44:04,807
Look, you want that medal, right?

578
00:44:04,988 --> 00:44:08,241
And I want a race
So, here's what I'm thinking

579
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,284
You help me get a new cart a real cart

580
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:14,460
and I'll win the race and get
you back your medal

581
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:17,079
You want me..
to help you???

582
00:44:17,114 --> 00:44:19,905
All you gotta do is break
something for me...

583
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:22,878
C'mon, what do you say, friend?

584
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:24,573
We are not friends

585
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:28,334
Oh. C'mon... pal
You son of a gun

586
00:44:28,488 --> 00:44:31,006
C'mon buddy Just shake on it

587
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:36,170
Ah.. c'mon jumbo
Ralph my man.. my main man...

588
00:44:36,556 --> 00:44:41,134
Hey, my arms getting tired
We have a deal or not?

589
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,652
You better win

590
00:44:47,908 --> 00:44:51,985
Well, I'll say this much... they don't
call your friend 'Wreck-it' for nothing

591
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:54,136
There's the shuttle

592
00:44:58,326 --> 00:44:59,859
Is he in there?

593
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,456
Nope. Lucky for him

594
00:45:02,556 --> 00:45:05,093
Otherwise, I would have slap his corpse

595
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,018
No Cy-Bug either

596
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:11,451
Gotta find it before it
lays it's filthy eggs

597
00:45:12,853 --> 00:45:17,343
He came this way but the Sugar particles
in the atmosphere are jamming my sensor

598
00:45:17,436 --> 00:45:19,032
Can't get a read on it

599
00:45:19,672 --> 00:45:21,142
So, what is it with this
Wreck-it joker, huh?

600
00:45:21,143 --> 00:45:22,612
Why'd he go AWOL?

601
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,092
I wish I knew, ma'am
he was acting all squirely last night

602
00:45:27,127 --> 00:45:29,877
Going on about cake and medals

603
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,442
But, I never thought he'd go Turbo!

604
00:45:32,477 --> 00:45:34,219
Go Turbo??

605
00:45:34,254 --> 00:45:36,959
That's right,
you guys just got plugged in

606
00:45:36,994 --> 00:45:39,966
Well, back when the Arcade first open

607
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,937
TurboTime was by far the
most popular game...

608
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:44,957
..and Turbo...
- Turbotastic.

609
00:45:45,023 --> 00:45:47,566
Well, he loved the attention..

610
00:45:47,685 --> 00:45:52,353
- Turbotastic
So, when Rogue Blaster got plugged in and

611
00:45:52,388 --> 00:45:54,071
stole Turbo's thunder
- New game

612
00:45:54,106 --> 00:45:56,909
- alright
...boy.. was he jealous.

613
00:45:56,944 --> 00:46:00,259
..so jealous that he abandoned..

614
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:02,084
..his game

615
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:03,678
..and try to take over the new one

616
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:05,236
- These are the greatest
graphics I've ever seen

617
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:08,266
Turbotastic
- Hey, is that..??

618
00:46:08,301 --> 00:46:12,256
That looks like Turbo.
- What's Turbo doing in this game?

619
00:46:12,317 --> 00:46:15,090
Oh, c'mon Mister Litwak

620
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:21,158
Turbo ended up putting both games
and himself out of order

621
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:22,951
...for good

622
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:27,887
Yes, The selfish man is like a mangy dog
chasing its own cautionary tail

623
00:46:27,922 --> 00:46:29,963
I know..right?

624
00:46:30,198 --> 00:46:34,883
That's why I have to get Ralph home or
the same thing's gonna happen to my game

625
00:46:38,927 --> 00:46:40,558
Ungh... Oh
- What is this?

626
00:46:41,486 --> 00:46:42,700
Nesquicksand?

627
00:46:42,735 --> 00:46:45,031
Quicksand

628
00:46:45,066 --> 00:46:47,932
Oh, I'll hop out and
grab you one of those vines

629
00:46:52,512 --> 00:46:54,690
I can't hop
I'm hop-less

630
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:57,309
This is hopeless We're gonna drown here

631
00:46:57,405 --> 00:47:01,197
Stop draking, stop..stop moving
You're making us sink faster

632
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:03,187
- We're gonna die..
Get a hold of yourself

633
00:47:07,051 --> 00:47:09,607
Ah, the vines They are Laffy Taffy.

634
00:47:09,683 --> 00:47:12,053
They're attracted to whatever
makes them laugh

635
00:47:12,273 --> 00:47:13,942
Here, hit me again

636
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,241
That's not funny enough Harder.

637
00:47:20,276 --> 00:47:22,445
Look, you're a nice guy I can't...

638
00:47:22,446 --> 00:47:24,613
- No, ma'am.. the Arcade
is depending on us

639
00:47:24,713 --> 00:47:27,767
Now do your duty That's an or..

640
00:47:30,592 --> 00:47:32,592
It's working..
Hit me again

641
00:47:32,617 --> 00:47:34,617
Oooh.. your eye..

642
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:36,365
I can fix it

643
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,180
Now go....

644
00:47:38,403 --> 00:47:40,230
Fra..fantastic

645
00:47:40,373 --> 00:47:41,582
Again

646
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,881
You mean business..

647
00:47:49,438 --> 00:47:51,223
Killing

648
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,700
s u b by:
m a X e e r ( M C )

649
00:48:19,491 --> 00:48:23,289
Alright, enought with the goo-goo eyes
We've got work to do, let's go

650
00:48:25,723 --> 00:48:27,366
Ungh!.. lost the Cy-Bug

651
00:48:27,545 --> 00:48:29,304
C'mon, we'll get a better
view from the air

652
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,966
You think you can fix that shuttle?

653
00:48:31,497 --> 00:48:33,654
Can do

654
00:48:57,891 --> 00:48:59,616
Alright, do your thing
knuckles, bust it open

655
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:01,340
- What's this?

656
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,129
You're a full-on criminal, aren't you?

657
00:49:03,164 --> 00:49:05,466
hey, we shook on it

658
00:49:08,915 --> 00:49:10,699
Thank you, jeeps

659
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:15,323
What is this place?
Where are the carts?

660
00:49:15,356 --> 00:49:17,746
We gotta make one
- What? No no no no.

661
00:49:17,846 --> 00:49:20,627
Look kid, bad idea
Trust me, I don't make things

662
00:49:20,727 --> 00:49:21,851
I break things

663
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:25,542
Well, looks like you're gonna be stepping
outside your comfort zone then, gladius

664
00:49:26,069 --> 00:49:27,471
Ooh, this is a good one

665
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:31,370
Welcome to the Bakery.
Let's bake a cart

666
00:49:31,405 --> 00:49:34,496
What is this? Another game?
- Ya, well.. it's a mini game

667
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,788
You have one minute to win it

668
00:49:36,823 --> 00:49:39,427
C'mon, Ralph.
- Now..Mixing.

669
00:49:39,462 --> 00:49:42,906
Put the ingredients in the bowl
and throw away the trash

670
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:44,369
Hairbrush..
- No

671
00:49:44,376 --> 00:49:46,185
Underpants..
- No, no

672
00:49:46,406 --> 00:49:49,227
You're getting all the wrong stuff, kid.
- I'm trying

673
00:49:50,005 --> 00:49:51,778
Afterall, I'll do it

674
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:52,989
No, yes

675
00:49:53,389 --> 00:49:55,798
Urgh!..Gross
Milk... yes yes..

676
00:49:57,223 --> 00:49:59,523
Bever up!

677
00:50:03,377 --> 00:50:05,734
C'mon, no sleeping on the job

678
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,321
Baking

679
00:50:07,356 --> 00:50:10,971
Pump up the head and hold
the perfect temperature

680
00:50:11,337 --> 00:50:13,483
A little help here
- I'm on it

681
00:50:15,135 --> 00:50:16,600
Ralph!??

682
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:18,065
- Yup, no bother.. I just...
- Give me this thing.

683
00:50:19,818 --> 00:50:23,564
Ok, good.. little more
Hold it, hold it

684
00:50:27,578 --> 00:50:31,098
C'mon get up Ralph.. 15 seconds
- Decorating

685
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:32,347
Wheels first
- How many?

686
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:33,902
Four, doink

687
00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:39,149
Now frosting, a butt load of frosting
- No problem

688
00:50:51,264 --> 00:50:52,924
Time's up!

689
00:50:52,959 --> 00:50:57,598
Congratulation you did it
and here's your cart

690
00:51:07,237 --> 00:51:09,147
Look, kid...

691
00:51:10,198 --> 00:51:11,877
I tried to warn you

692
00:51:11,912 --> 00:51:16,287
I..i can't make things, I just... break
- I love it!

693
00:51:16,569 --> 00:51:18,182
You do?

694
00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:21,955
I love it!
I love it, I love it, I love it

695
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:25,120
Look, it's got a real engine
and look at these wheels

696
00:51:26,873 --> 00:51:29,834
I love it I finally have a real cart

697
00:51:30,479 --> 00:51:34,887
C'mon, a work of art like this
must be signed

698
00:51:45,427 --> 00:51:48,283
This is Beard Papa.
The glitch is in the Bakery.

699
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:50,164
Get me King Candy.

700
00:51:54,815 --> 00:51:59,839
Well, what?? you have teeth? I don't
think I've ever seen you smile before

701
00:52:00,058 --> 00:52:01,472
I'm not smiling it was...

702
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,179
I'm gassy.. okay

703
00:52:05,475 --> 00:52:08,276
Hold it right there, glitch

704
00:52:08,496 --> 00:52:10,116
And Wreck-It Ralph?

705
00:52:12,343 --> 00:52:14,830
Start the cart start the cart...

706
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:17,216
- I.....
What are you waiting for? c'mon let's go

707
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:21,494
I..uh.. I ..don't know how
to drive a real cart

708
00:52:21,529 --> 00:52:23,305
You don't...
What!?

709
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,983
Are you hurt, sire?
- No, he just glazed me

710
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,654
Get them
- Gain way

711
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,651
Stop in the name of the king

712
00:52:35,654 --> 00:52:37,158
..that's me

713
00:52:41,681 --> 00:52:43,302
Get off the road

714
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,668
Head for Diet Cola Mountain.

715
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,619
Drive into the wall..
- What?

716
00:52:55,654 --> 00:52:57,540
Right there between the
two sugar-free lollipops

717
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,425
- Are you crazy?

718
00:52:59,526 --> 00:53:01,051
Just do it

719
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,155
Where'd they go?

720
00:53:14,268 --> 00:53:16,286
Maybe.. they've just turned..

721
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:20,943
Find that glitch destroy that cart

722
00:53:20,978 --> 00:53:23,742
She can't be allowed to race

723
00:53:28,103 --> 00:53:29,720
So let me get this straight

724
00:53:29,931 --> 00:53:32,194
You don't know how to drive

725
00:53:32,229 --> 00:53:35,280
Well no, not technically
But I just thought that...

726
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,114
What did you think? Oh.. I
just I'll just magically

727
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:40,847
win the race just because
I really want to

728
00:53:40,848 --> 00:53:45,151
Look wise guy, I know I'm a
racer, I can feel it in my cone

729
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:49,453
That's it..!
I'm never getting my medal back

730
00:53:49,617 --> 00:53:52,702
What is the big whoop about
that crummy medal, anyway?

731
00:53:52,703 --> 00:53:55,787
- The big whoop, well this
may come as a shock to you..

732
00:53:55,887 --> 00:54:00,069
but in my game, I'm the bad guy
and I live in the garbage

733
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:04,786
Cool... - No, not cool
Unhygenic and lonely and boring

734
00:54:04,886 --> 00:54:08,742
And that crummy medal
was gonna change all that

735
00:54:08,777 --> 00:54:12,017
I go home with that
baby around my neck then I'll get a

736
00:54:12,026 --> 00:54:16,254
penthouse, pies,
ice sculptures, fireworks

737
00:54:17,414 --> 00:54:19,166
It's grown up stuffs,
you wouldn't understand

738
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:20,917
- No, I get it

739
00:54:21,397 --> 00:54:23,892
That's exactly what racing
would do for me

740
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,376
Well, guess what?
- What?

741
00:54:25,476 --> 00:54:28,619
News flash..neither one of us
is getting what we want

742
00:54:31,347 --> 00:54:32,615
What was that?

743
00:54:45,374 --> 00:54:47,763
Diet Cola Hot Springs

744
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:51,517
Watch out for falling Mentos
- Ya, check it out, look

745
00:54:59,584 --> 00:55:02,660
Oh, you gotta watch out for the splash
That stuff is boiling hot

746
00:55:02,695 --> 00:55:04,863
Ya, I got that thank you

747
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:07,099
What is this dump?

748
00:55:07,134 --> 00:55:10,609
I think it's some sort of
unfinished bonus level

749
00:55:10,962 --> 00:55:12,832
Ya, it's pretty cool, huh?

750
00:55:12,954 --> 00:55:16,209
I found that secret opening
and now I live here

751
00:55:16,777 --> 00:55:18,343
See, oh look look look look

752
00:55:18,961 --> 00:55:20,975
Welcome to my home

753
00:55:21,762 --> 00:55:24,439
I sleep in these candy wrappers I like

754
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,116
bundling myself up like
a little homeless lady

755
00:55:28,289 --> 00:55:30,344
By yourself?

756
00:55:30,772 --> 00:55:32,729
With all these garbage around here?

757
00:55:33,565 --> 00:55:35,692
Well, ya

758
00:55:35,727 --> 00:55:37,808
I mean, everyone here
says I'm just the mistake

759
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:39,888
and that I wasn't even suppose to exist

760
00:55:39,924 --> 00:55:41,683
What do you expect?

761
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:43,251
Listen kid..

762
00:55:43,963 --> 00:55:46,521
I know it's none of my business

763
00:55:46,557 --> 00:55:49,057
but why do you even stick
around this game

764
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:51,758
You really don't know anything, do you?

765
00:55:51,793 --> 00:55:54,165
Glitches can't leave their games

766
00:55:55,692 --> 00:55:58,569
It's one of the joyous of being me

767
00:56:07,248 --> 00:56:09,378
Hey, what are you doing?
C'mon..

768
00:56:09,973 --> 00:56:12,454
I know it's a dump but it's all I got

769
00:56:12,489 --> 00:56:15,494
If you're gonna be a racer,
then, you'll have to learn how to drive

770
00:56:15,535 --> 00:56:17,145
You can't do that...

771
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,846
without a track

772
00:56:24,153 --> 00:56:25,514
Alright now..

773
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:28,211
Let's hustle up, we got
some driving to do

774
00:56:28,212 --> 00:56:30,821
- No wonder I'm driving..I'm gonna
learn to drive.. I'm gonna..

775
00:56:30,822 --> 00:56:33,940
Oh wait, do you know how to drive?
- Ya, I mean, I haven't done it but...

776
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:35,634
look, I flew a spaceship today okay

777
00:56:35,669 --> 00:56:38,896
You crashed it
- Just get in, how hard can it be? okay

778
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:40,752
Uh.. start it up

779
00:56:43,335 --> 00:56:44,886
There you go

780
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:47,638
So there's some buttons on the floor
- Pedals

781
00:56:47,673 --> 00:56:50,520
Pedals, right!
Now.. uh..

782
00:56:51,427 --> 00:56:53,866
Thats the 'go' pedal

783
00:56:53,901 --> 00:56:57,997
That, I believe is the stopper

784
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:01,238
And this... wait

785
00:57:01,273 --> 00:57:03,224
What is this?
It doesn't do anything

786
00:57:03,555 --> 00:57:05,201
Woo, what's this joystick do?

787
00:57:06,242 --> 00:57:08,600
Okay, good.
Let's try that again

788
00:57:41,351 --> 00:57:44,446
That's good, keep going Shift it again

789
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:52,645
I told you Racing's in my cone

790
00:57:55,529 --> 00:57:59,721
Is that little not the best?
- Hey you Ralphy, watch this

791
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,002
Look out!

792
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,195
So, how did I do?

793
00:58:34,162 --> 00:58:37,092
Well, you almost blew
up the whole mountain

794
00:58:37,635 --> 00:58:39,375
Righ right, that's a good note

795
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,406
You gotta get that
glitch under control kid

796
00:58:41,441 --> 00:58:43,114
Ok, I will I will and..

797
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,216
And then, you think I get a chance?

798
00:58:49,004 --> 00:58:49,975
Tiny

799
00:58:50,181 --> 00:58:53,577
Yes, I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win I'm
gonna win, I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win

800
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:55,260
Top shelf
- Top shelf

801
00:59:08,136 --> 00:59:10,228
Did you find the..?
Tell me you found her..

802
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,495
You didn't?

803
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:17,966
Go, leave me.

804
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,500
Up up down dwon..
hmm hmm.. hih ..hih

805
00:59:43,726 --> 00:59:45,470
Start.

806
00:59:47,468 --> 00:59:51,506
Oh.. Code
That's the sweet lifeblood of the game

807
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:59,531
Where are you?

808
00:59:59,566 --> 01:00:03,042
The Stadium, no.
Jumbotrons

809
01:00:03,078 --> 01:00:04,567
Ahah!
There it is

810
01:00:04,894 --> 01:00:06,559
The winner's cup

811
01:00:08,032 --> 01:00:11,600
One of these things is not like
the others... it's you

812
01:00:11,635 --> 01:00:14,474
We're gonna give you a nice new home

813
01:00:26,432 --> 01:00:27,954
Success

814
01:00:29,602 --> 01:00:34,156
Sour Bill, I'm going out, you're in charge
of the castle until I get back

815
01:00:45,336 --> 01:00:48,904
Your face is still red, you might
wanna hit it again with your hammer

816
01:00:48,939 --> 01:00:51,739
Oh, that's not blood force trauma ma'am

817
01:00:51,756 --> 01:00:53,904
That's just the honey glow in my cheeks

818
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:58,642
Okay..
- Ma'am, I just gotta tell ya

819
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:02,789

Wow..
You are one dynamite gal..

821
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:11,030
One dynamite gal

822
01:01:11,317 --> 01:01:14,739
Dynamite gal

823
01:01:14,764 --> 01:01:16,764
Dynamite....

824
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:22,427
Get out

825
01:01:22,462 --> 01:01:26,014
All I said is you're a dynamite gal?
- I said get out

826
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:36,700
Oh.. jimanny jamanny

827
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:44,948
Yes

828
01:01:45,934 --> 01:01:50,563
I'm Fix-It Felix Jr, sir
from the game Fix-It Felix Jr.

829
01:01:50,575 --> 01:01:53,925
Have you seen my friend Ralph?
- Wreck-It Ralph?

830
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,421
Yes, yes that's him

831
01:01:55,456 --> 01:01:58,695
Should've lock him up
when we had the chance

832
01:01:58,956 --> 01:02:03,313
Lock him up?
- Not making the same mistake with you

833
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:10,545
Hurry hurry, let's go
time's a wastin' ..c'mon Ralph

834
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:14,159
This is it, this is really happening
I almost don't believe it

835
01:02:14,194 --> 01:02:17,442
I mean, I have dreamt about it
for so long and now..

836
01:02:17,478 --> 01:02:20,500
and now.. now I think I'm gonna
puke actually, I think I might puke

837
01:02:20,535 --> 01:02:22,183
You know, like a 'vurp'

838
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:23,959
A what?
- Vomit and a burp together

839
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:28,229
and you can taste it, and it's just
like rising up Oh this is so exciting

Yes, it is, it's exciting

841
01:02:30,325 --> 01:02:32,342
I mean am I ready to be a real racer?

842
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:34,428
Ralph, what if the gamers don't like me?

843
01:02:34,492 --> 01:02:36,279
Who doesn't love a brat with dirty hair?

844
01:02:37,327 --> 01:02:40,354
C'mon Those people are gonna love you

845

A winner

847
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:49,401
I'm adorable
- And everyone loves an adorable winner

848

Okay, c'mon
Listen to me, if you get nervous

849
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:59,970
just keep telling yourslef 'I must win
Ralph's medal or his life will be ruined'

850
01:02:59,993 --> 01:03:02,814
And have fun, got it?
- Got it!

851
01:03:03,912 --> 01:03:07,872
Oh wait!
Hold on..

852
01:03:07,907 --> 01:03:11,047
Where you going?
- I forgot something, I'll be right back

853
01:03:13,672 --> 01:03:15,527
Kids

854
01:03:16,688 --> 01:03:19,561
Ralph, there you are, hello
- Huh??

855
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:22,434
You!!
- No no, I come alone, unarmed

856
01:03:23,121 --> 01:03:26,905
I've had enough of you, pillow pants
- Calm down, please

857
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:30,491
I'm gonna beat the hella out of you

858
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,511
You wouldn't hit a guy with
glasses, would you?

859
01:03:33,233 --> 01:03:35,976
You hit a guy with glasses, that's..

860
01:03:36,011 --> 01:03:38,888
well played
- What do you want Candy?

861
01:03:38,924 --> 01:03:40,866
Listen, I just wanna talk to you

862
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:43,832
I'm not intrested in anything
you have to say

863
01:03:43,867 --> 01:03:47,863
But how about this?
Are you interested... in this?

864
01:03:47,879 --> 01:03:51,327
My medal..how did you..??
- It doesn't matter

865
01:03:51,362 --> 01:03:54,008
here, it's yours Go ahead and take it

866
01:03:57,608 --> 01:04:00,022
All I ask is that you hear me out

867
01:04:00,054 --> 01:04:02,243
About what?

868
01:04:02,278 --> 01:04:06,032
Ralph, do you know what the hardest
part about being a king is?

869
01:04:06,367 --> 01:04:08,116
Doing what's right

870
01:04:08,151 --> 01:04:10,180
No matter what
- Get to the point

871
01:04:10,215 --> 01:04:11,933
Point being I need your help

872
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:17,361
Sad as it is,
Vanellope cannot be allowed to race

873
01:04:17,396 --> 01:04:21,054
Why are you people so against her?
- I'm not against her..

874
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:25,151
I'm trying to protect her.
If Vanellope wins that race..

875
01:04:25,186 --> 01:04:27,896
she'll be added to the race roster

876
01:04:27,899 --> 01:04:31,481
Then gamers can choose
the racer's avatar

877
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:36,964
And when they see her glitching and then
get glitching in just being herself

878
01:04:37,015 --> 01:04:39,617
They'll think our game is broken

879
01:04:39,961 --> 01:04:42,291
We'll be put ourt of order for good

880
01:04:43,365 --> 01:04:46,024
All my subjects will be homeless

881
01:04:47,788 --> 01:04:51,759
But there is one who cannot escape
because she's a glitch

882
01:04:51,794 --> 01:04:54,874
Help.
Somebody help me..

883
01:04:54,909 --> 01:04:57,480
When the game's plug is pulled

884
01:04:59,847 --> 01:05:02,386
she'll die with it

885
01:05:03,182 --> 01:05:05,279
You don't know that will happen

886
01:05:05,314 --> 01:05:09,315
The gamers could love her
- And if they don't?

887
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:21,695
I know it's tough, but heroes have
to make the tough choices, don't they?

888
01:05:21,977 --> 01:05:25,385
She can't race Ralph but...

889
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,383
She won't listen to me

890
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:31,713
So, can I count on you to
talk a little sense into her?

891
01:05:33,578 --> 01:05:38,122
Very good
Uh.. I'll give you two some time alone

892
01:06:04,462 --> 01:06:06,218
I'm back..

893
01:06:06,785 --> 01:06:09,279
Did you miss me?
- Yea..Uh..

894
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,742
Hey, can we talk for a second?
- Wait, first kneel down

895
01:06:14,747 --> 01:06:17,391
What? no no. w.we really..
- You just do it!

896
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:19,016
Okay

897
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:22,453
Now, close your eyes

898
01:06:22,493 --> 01:06:24,030
Vanellope..
- Shut.. close them

899
01:06:28,339 --> 01:06:30,820
Okay, open them up

900
01:06:32,235 --> 01:06:35,350
To Stinkbrain Jee, thanks

901
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:38,927
Turn it over "YOURE MY HERO"

902
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:42,637
I made it for you
Just in case we don't win

903
01:06:42,675 --> 01:06:46,367
Not that I think there's even a
remote chance we're not gonna win

904
01:06:46,494 --> 01:06:51,957
Thanks kid..Uhmm, listen
- Now.. rise, my royal champ

905
01:06:51,992 --> 01:06:54,468
I've got a date with destiny

906
01:06:54,503 --> 01:06:57,353
Ralph, c'mon move your molases

907
01:06:58,507 --> 01:07:01,539
Uh, I've been thinking
- That's dangerous

908
01:07:01,574 --> 01:07:04,704
Who cares about this
stupid race anyway? Right?

909
01:07:04,739 --> 01:07:07,936
That's not very funny, Ralph
- No, I'm serious and..uh..

910
01:07:08,128 --> 01:07:11,657
It was really fun to build the cart
and everything but.. maybe..

911
01:07:11,692 --> 01:07:15,679
maybe, you shouldn't do it
- Uh.. Hello? Is Ralph in there?

912
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,912
I'd like to speak to him please

913
01:07:17,913 --> 01:07:20,125
- Look what I'm saying
is, you can't be a racer

914
01:07:20,344 --> 01:07:24,059
What?
why would you..

915
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:27,169
Wait a minute..

916
01:07:27,392 --> 01:07:29,812
No.
- Where did you get this?

917
01:07:30,161 --> 01:07:33,624
Look, I'm gonna be straight with you kid,
I've been talking to King Candy..

918
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:37,117
King Candy? You sold me out?
- Yea

919
01:07:37,118 --> 01:07:39,268
No, I didn't..
Listen, you don't understand

920
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:41,590
No I understand, plunny traitor!

921
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:44,194
I'm not a traitor, listen..
- You're a rat

922
01:07:44,229 --> 01:07:47,622
and I don't need you
and I can win the race on my own

923
01:07:47,657 --> 01:07:51,336
But I'm trying to save your skin, kid
- Put me down, let me go..

924
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:54,546
No, you listen to me, you know whats gonna
happen when the players see you glitching

925
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:57,625
They're gonna think the game's broken
- I don't care, you're a liar

926
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:59,985
Yo, you better care because if your game
goes out of order

927
01:08:00,021 --> 01:08:01,711
you go down with the
ship later, thats true

928
01:08:01,712 --> 01:08:03,401
- I'm not listening to
you, get out of my way

929
01:08:03,734 --> 01:08:06,134
I'm going to that race
- No, you're not

930
01:08:07,818 --> 01:08:10,941
Take me down from here, Ralph... right now
- No

931
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:13,578
I'm doing this for your own good

932
01:08:15,468 --> 01:08:17,578
Wait, wait wait

933
01:08:18,081 --> 01:08:22,336
No.. no.. no no no no
Please Ralph...

934
01:08:22,371 --> 01:08:25,567
No....
Stop it! ..Stop it...

935
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:28,765
No...

936
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:46,991
You really are a bad guy

937
01:09:21,389 --> 01:09:24,725
Hello, anybody home?

938
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:27,295
Felix..
Mary..

939
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:33,211
Well, you actually went and did it
- Gene, where is everybody?

940
01:09:33,538 --> 01:09:38,316
They're gone, after Felix went to find you
and then didn't come back

941
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:40,898
Everyone panicked and abandon ship

942
01:09:40,933 --> 01:09:44,827
But.. but, I'm here now?
- It's too late, Ralph

943
01:09:45,421 --> 01:09:47,786
Litwak's pulling our plug in the morning

944
01:09:59,047 --> 01:10:03,293
But, never let it be said that
I'm not a man of my word

945
01:10:03,421 --> 01:10:06,754
The place is yours, Ralph.
Enjoy.

946
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,446
Gene, wait, wait

947
01:10:12,055 --> 01:10:14,816
Listen, this is not what I wanted

948
01:10:14,907 --> 01:10:19,594
Well, what did you want, Ralph?
- I don't know.. I.. I just

949
01:10:22,513 --> 01:10:25,807
I was just tired of living alone
in the garbage

950
01:10:26,849 --> 01:10:30,259
Well now, you can live alone
in the Penthouse

951
01:11:37,025 --> 01:11:40,368
Hey cough-drop,
explain something to me

952
01:11:40,403 --> 01:11:42,925
If Vanellope was never meant to exist...

953
01:11:43,038 --> 01:11:46,014
then why is her picture on
the side of the game console?

954
01:11:50,095 --> 01:11:53,930
What's going on in this candy coated
hearted darkness? -Nothing...

955
01:11:53,965 --> 01:11:55,680
Talk.. - No
I'll lick you..

956
01:11:55,863 --> 01:11:57,225
You wouldn't
- Oh yea?

957
01:11:58,971 --> 01:12:00,979
That's like sand-paper

958
01:12:01,537 --> 01:12:04,560
Wonder how many licks it will take
to get to your centre?

959
01:12:04,595 --> 01:12:07,608
Well, say that to my grave..
- Fair enough!

960
01:12:10,829 --> 01:12:13,403
They call you Sour Bill for a reason

961
01:12:14,058 --> 01:12:17,551
Had it enough yet?
- Okay okay, I'll talk, I'll talk.

962
01:12:17,586 --> 01:12:21,794
Vanellope was a racer until
King Candy try to delete her code

963
01:12:21,829 --> 01:12:25,485
Try to delete her code?
So, that's why she's a glitch

964
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,194
Why is he doing this to her?
- I don't know.

965
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:31,865
Suit yourself
- No no no, I swear I don't know

966
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:35,822
He literally locked up our memory
and I cannot remember

967
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:38,850
Nobody can But, I do know this..

968
01:12:38,885 --> 01:12:43,360
He'll do anything to keep her from racing
because if she crosses the finish line...

969
01:12:43,529 --> 01:12:46,661
the game will reset
and she won't be a glitch anymore

970
01:12:46,697 --> 01:12:48,309
Where is she now?

971
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:49,920
- In the Fungeon with Fix-It Felix.
- Felix??

972
01:12:49,955 --> 01:12:52,411
I'm sorry, that's all I know
that's all I know, I swear

973
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:56,831
No please don't put me back
in your filthy mouth again

974
01:12:58,949 --> 01:13:03,625
Stick around
- Yes, okay I will, I will.. thank you

975
01:13:07,222 --> 01:13:09,005
C'mon I know you're out there

976
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:13,519
Saccharin saturated nightmare

977
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,531
Where?

978
01:13:34,847 --> 01:13:39,850
Doomsday and Armageddon just had
a baby, and it is ugly

979
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:46,522
Hello, hello... somebody?
Anybody?

980
01:13:46,523 --> 01:13:49,155
Please let me out

981
01:13:49,988 --> 01:13:54,296
What is that.. what he says...?
I'm gonna wreck it

982
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:00,817
Why do I fix everything I touch?

983
01:14:04,596 --> 01:14:08,320
Felix
- Ralph, I'm so glad to see you

984
01:14:08,882 --> 01:14:12,643
No, wait.. I'm not
What do you have to say for yourself?

985
01:14:12,678 --> 01:14:15,811
Wait, I don't want to hear
I'm not talking to you

986
01:14:15,846 --> 01:14:17,397
Okay, don't talk That's fine

987
01:14:17,432 --> 01:14:19,427
But you have to fix this go-cart
for me pronto

988
01:14:19,527 --> 01:14:22,964
I don't have to do boo
Forgive my potty mouth

989
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,995
I'm just so..
so crossed with you

990
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:28,375
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

991
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:31,314
I were in Hickelty pickelty
all over creation looking

992
01:14:31,315 --> 01:14:34,218
for you, I almost drowned
in chocolate milk mix

993
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:38,072
And then, I met the most dynamite gal

994
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:41,845
Oh.. she gives me the
honey glow, something aweful

995
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:47,161
But, she rebuff my affections
And then, I got thrown in jail

996
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:48,696
Felix, pull yourself together

997
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:54,086
No, Ralph you don't know what it's like to
be rejected and treated like a criminal

998
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:57,755
Yes, I do That's everyday in my life

999
01:14:58,386 --> 01:15:01,171
It is?
- Which is why I ran off

1000
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:03,373
I try to be a good guy but I'm not

1001
01:15:03,408 --> 01:15:06,386
Just a bad guy and I need your help

1002
01:15:06,421 --> 01:15:08,557
There's a little girl
whose only hope is this cart

1003
01:15:08,592 --> 01:15:10,505
Please, Felix fix it

1004
01:15:10,933 --> 01:15:14,116
And I promise I will never try
to be good again

1005
01:15:37,654 --> 01:15:40,220
I know, I know, I know I'm an idiot

1006
01:15:40,686 --> 01:15:43,927
And?
- and a real Numbskull

1007
01:15:43,962 --> 01:15:46,933
And?
- a selfish diaper baby.

1008
01:15:46,968 --> 01:15:51,351
And?
- and.. a Stinkbrain.

1009
01:15:51,386 --> 01:15:54,537
The stinkiest brain ever

1010
01:16:16,696 --> 01:16:22,031
My sweet subjects, I came without a
flinch of hesitation to show you

1011
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:25,016
that I have never been
so happy in all my life

1012
01:16:25,051 --> 01:16:27,323
to say the following words

1013
01:16:27,554 --> 01:16:31,234
Let the Random Roster Race commence

1014
01:16:47,767 --> 01:16:50,743
Okay, remember.. you don't
have to win Just cross

1015
01:16:50,744 --> 01:16:53,718
that finish line and
you'll be a real racer

1016
01:16:53,806 --> 01:16:55,723
I'm already a real racer

1017
01:16:58,292 --> 01:17:00,544
And I'm gonna win

1018
01:17:23,769 --> 01:17:25,299
Power Up.

1019
01:17:32,847 --> 01:17:35,010
Oh..
A La Mode.

1020
01:17:38,707 --> 01:17:40,757
Sweet Seekers.

1021
01:17:40,912 --> 01:17:43,214
Have some candy

1022
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:05,140
Behind you..
Infront of you..

1023
01:18:12,049 --> 01:18:15,203
It's the glitch
- The glitch

1024
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:17,705
Light 'em up Candlehead

1025
01:18:20,454 --> 01:18:23,741
What's this?
Cherry Bomb.

1026
01:18:30,407 --> 01:18:33,582
I told you
You're just an accident waiting to happen

1027
01:18:51,069 --> 01:18:52,876
My candle...

1028
01:18:53,668 --> 01:18:56,429
Alright, gotta keep it under control

1029
01:18:56,491 --> 01:18:58,645
No more glitching

1030
01:18:59,342 --> 01:19:02,822
Okay kid, let's finish this thing
without any more surprises

1031
01:19:03,717 --> 01:19:05,936
Hope you're happy jump-pile

1032
01:19:05,971 --> 01:19:08,953
This game is going down and
it's all your fault

1033
01:19:08,988 --> 01:19:11,657
My lady, you came back
- Canned it, Fix-It.

1034
01:19:11,811 --> 01:19:14,797
That Cy-Bug you brought with you
multiplied

1035
01:19:14,832 --> 01:19:18,075
No, it died in the taffy swamp
believe me

1036
01:19:20,531 --> 01:19:23,020
You're wrong!

1037
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:33,125
Listen up people,
head to Game Central Station, now..

1038
01:19:33,247 --> 01:19:35,224
Move it let's go let's go

1039
01:19:45,142 --> 01:19:46,813
No

1040
01:20:27,535 --> 01:20:32,795
Get off of my track
- hey, what are you crazy?

1041
01:20:33,394 --> 01:20:38,408
I forbid you to cross that finish line

1042
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:42,202
Knock it out

1043
01:20:43,345 --> 01:20:47,788
Ralph, look
- Kid...

1044
01:20:49,618 --> 01:20:54,451
No, Stop it. - Let me.. urgh!!
- Not letting you undo all my hard work

1045
01:20:56,672 --> 01:20:58,797
Is that....

1046
01:21:00,281 --> 01:21:02,783
No way....

1047
01:21:03,652 --> 01:21:07,408
What the... Who are you??
- I'm Turbo

1048
01:21:07,447 --> 01:21:09,807
The greatest racer ever

1049
01:21:09,992 --> 01:21:13,071
And I did not reprogram
this world to let you

1050
01:21:13,106 --> 01:21:17,897
and that holocust riddled warhock
take it away from me

1051
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:21,046
Turbotastic

1052
01:21:21,471 --> 01:21:24,136
End of the line, glitch

1053
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,469
Glitch. That's it

1054
01:21:27,569 --> 01:21:30,904
C'mon, Vanellope. I know you said
you wouldn't do it again...

1055
01:21:30,939 --> 01:21:35,692
But you're gonna do it one more time
Just focus and concentrate

1056
01:21:35,727 --> 01:21:39,302
And..
Glitch.

1057
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:41,839
No

1058
01:21:42,808 --> 01:21:47,606
Sweet mother of monkey milk I did it

1059
01:21:47,792 --> 01:21:50,041
No

1060
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:58,370
Bring it home kid
The finish line's wide open

1061
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:15,161
No

1062
01:22:15,502 --> 01:22:17,072
Kid, kid are you okay?

1063
01:22:17,107 --> 01:22:19,453
I'm fine, I'm fine
Let's finish this race

1064
01:22:24,313 --> 01:22:27,391
Oh my randd!!
- Alright C'mon we gotta get out of here

1065
01:22:27,426 --> 01:22:31,057
But I didn't cross the finish line
- There is no finish line

1066
01:22:31,782 --> 01:22:34,460
Move it or lose it people
c'mon everybody out now

1067
01:22:36,774 --> 01:22:39,449
Ralph, it's not gonna work
- We gotta try

1068
01:22:43,651 --> 01:22:45,949
Kid
- Ralph I told you I can't leave the game

1069
01:22:46,516 --> 01:22:48,852
C'mon
- Ralph, just stop

1070
01:22:49,643 --> 01:22:53,351
It's gotta work
- Stop, it's no use

1071
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,283
It's okay, Ralph.

1072
01:23:05,677 --> 01:23:09,240
Alright Fix-It, that's everyone
now we gotta blow up this exit

1073
01:23:11,757 --> 01:23:14,243
Just go, go without me

1074
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:17,619
What about this game?
- Nothing we can do about it

1075
01:23:17,654 --> 01:23:21,782
Without a beacon, there's no way
to stop these monsters

1076
01:23:25,045 --> 01:23:28,799
Beacon..
stay with Felix

1077
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:32,122
Let me borrow that thing lady
- Ralph, where are you going?

1078
01:23:32,157 --> 01:23:34,258
I got some wrecking to do

1079
01:23:34,357 --> 01:23:37,088
I'll meet you at the finish line
- No, wait

1080
01:23:37,123 --> 01:23:39,104
Fix-It, get behind me

1081
01:23:58,805 --> 01:24:00,383
One more..

1082
01:24:02,664 --> 01:24:06,343
Welcome to the Boss Level
- Turbo.

1083
01:24:07,137 --> 01:24:13,949
Because of you, Ralph, I'm now
the most powerful virus in the Arcade

1084
01:24:14,363 --> 01:24:16,333
I can take over any game I want

1085
01:24:16,368 --> 01:24:20,773
I should thank you
but.. it'd be more fun to kill you

1086
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:25,074
Get back here little guy

1087
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:35,472
Where do you think you're going?

1088
01:24:39,854 --> 01:24:42,072
I'm not through with you yet

1089
01:24:42,107 --> 01:24:44,290
Up we go
- No

1090
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:53,024
Fall back

1091
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:56,433
Kid

1092
01:25:02,404 --> 01:25:04,593
Look at that, it's your little friend

1093
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:08,460
Let's watch her die together, shall we

1094
01:25:08,569 --> 01:25:10,536
No

1095
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:15,623
It's game over for both of you
- No

1096
01:25:16,181 --> 01:25:18,704
Just for me

1097
01:25:27,259 --> 01:25:30,266
I'm bad, and that's good

1098
01:25:30,943 --> 01:25:34,070
I will never be good and that's not bad

1099
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:42,309
There's no one I'd rather be..
..than me

1100
01:26:09,982 --> 01:26:14,031
Kid
- Don't worry, I got it under control

1101
01:26:39,631 --> 01:26:43,958
Why are you going into the light...

1102
01:26:44,467 --> 01:26:49,889
No, no..
Yea.

1103
01:26:51,126 --> 01:26:54,834
Go into the light

1104
01:27:01,848 --> 01:27:06,696
Chocolate, it's chocolate
I love chocolate

1105
01:27:07,134 --> 01:27:10,566
Beautiful chocolate

1106
01:27:11,312 --> 01:27:15,180
You did it, Ralph.
Oh..Way to go brother

1107
01:27:21,292 --> 01:27:23,894
I'm... es..

1108
01:27:29,382 --> 01:27:32,514
All fixed
- You ready for this?

1109
01:27:32,549 --> 01:27:34,644
Ready as I'll ever be

1110
01:27:43,367 --> 01:27:46,242
Look at all the magic sparkles

1111
01:28:16,251 --> 01:28:18,657
Now, I remember

1112
01:28:19,632 --> 01:28:24,144
All hail, the rightful ruler
of Sugar Rush.

1113
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:26,414
Princess Vanellope.

1114
01:28:26,449 --> 01:28:29,242
I remember She's a princess

1115
01:28:29,277 --> 01:28:30,775
That's right

1116
01:28:30,776 --> 01:28:32,272
- We are so sorry about
the way we treated you

1117
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,467
Ya, those were jokes..

1118
01:28:33,502 --> 01:28:37,087
See, I was just doing
what Taffyta told me to

1119
01:28:37,122 --> 01:28:42,026
Tat tat! as your merciful princess
I hereby decree that

1120
01:28:42,162 --> 01:28:47,265
everyone who has ever
mean to be shall be...

1121
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,887
..executed
- What?

1122
01:28:49,922 --> 01:28:52,269
No no no, please please
- Oh my lamnd

1123
01:28:52,304 --> 01:28:54,775
Oh this place just got interesting

1124
01:28:55,157 --> 01:28:58,025
I don't wanna die
- I'm just kidding

1125
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:00,596
You are?
- Stop crying, Taffyta.

1126
01:29:00,631 --> 01:29:02,976
I'm trying but..
it won't stop

1127
01:29:03,747 --> 01:29:06,806
Wow.. so this is
the real you?

1128
01:29:07,577 --> 01:29:10,665
Princess..
- Oh, Ralph, what are you nuts?

1129
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:16,173
C'mon, this isn't me This is me

1130
01:29:17,063 --> 01:29:21,023
Look, the code may say I'm a princess but,
I know who I really am Ralph

1131
01:29:21,058 --> 01:29:24,459
I'm a racer with the greatest
superpower ever

1132
01:29:24,494 --> 01:29:26,079
I was here I was there.

1133
01:29:26,114 --> 01:29:29,083
I was glitching through the wall
I'm not giving that up

1134
01:29:29,741 --> 01:29:34,765
Pardon me for asking but, without a
princess, who's gonna lead us? - Yea who?

1135
01:29:35,564 --> 01:29:41,019
Uh.. me. I'm thinking more along
the lines of a constitutional democracy

1136
01:29:41,054 --> 01:29:44,301
President Vanellope von Schweetz.

1137
01:29:44,351 --> 01:29:46,617
Has a nice ring to it don't you think?

1138
01:29:47,789 --> 01:29:49,944
Fix-It, Wreck-It, the
Arcade's about to open.

1139
01:29:49,945 --> 01:29:52,099
Let's move 'em out

1140
01:29:59,616 --> 01:30:02,627
You know you could just stay here
and live in the castle

1141
01:30:02,662 --> 01:30:05,405
You'd have your own wing
where no one would

1142
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,459
ever complain about you or
treat you bad ever again

1143
01:30:08,495 --> 01:30:10,638
You could be happy

1144
01:30:11,007 --> 01:30:13,153
I'm already happy

1145
01:30:13,188 --> 01:30:15,703
Got the coolest friend in the world

1146
01:30:15,972 --> 01:30:18,889
And besides, I've got a job to do too

1147
01:30:18,924 --> 01:30:22,218
May not be as fancy as
being president...

1148
01:30:22,253 --> 01:30:25,617
but it's my duty And it's a big duty

1149
01:30:26,621 --> 01:30:28,836
Ralph, you coming brother?

1150
01:30:30,034 --> 01:30:32,845
See you later, president Fartfeathers.

1151
01:30:32,912 --> 01:30:36,466
Au revoir, admiral Underpants.

1152
01:30:36,649 --> 01:30:39,422
And farewell, bareness Boogerface.

1153
01:30:39,457 --> 01:30:41,808
Goodbye, major Bodyodour.

1154
01:30:41,841 --> 01:30:44,324
Hasta la vista.

1155
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:46,792
Ralph..
- Alright, to be continued

1156
01:31:01,071 --> 01:31:03,446
I'm gonna wreck it

1157
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:07,541
Hey, Ralph's back Isn't it great?

1158
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:11,941
The game's all here
- So, I'm happy to report...

1159
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:16,571
and you'll be happy to hear
I'm taking life one game at a time

1160
01:31:18,204 --> 01:31:20,625
First, the job hasn't change

1161
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:25,244
But, news flash..
The Nicelanders are being nice to me

1162
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:29,127
And you know that got me thinking about
those poor guys left without a game

1163
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:31,817
So here's what we did
- We're going to wreck it!

1164
01:31:31,852 --> 01:31:34,494
We ask them to help us out
in the bonus level

1165
01:31:34,883 --> 01:31:36,400
We can fix it!

1166
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:39,968
I'm tellin' you guys, we haven't been
this popular in years

1167
01:31:40,003 --> 01:31:44,657
It's crazy The gamers say we're Retro

1168
01:31:44,692 --> 01:31:47,237
which... It means...
Old.. but Cool

1169
01:31:47,272 --> 01:31:48,566
How come I never noticed this game

1170
01:31:48,601 --> 01:31:52,109
Oh and I decided that living in
a dump wasn't making me feel very good

1171
01:31:52,144 --> 01:31:56,821
So, I cleaned it up, built myself a little
shack and a couple for the new guys too

1172
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:00,535
Well, with a little help from Felix

1173
01:32:00,570 --> 01:32:03,977
Oh and guess who is the best man
at his and Calhoun's wedding?

1174
01:32:04,012 --> 01:32:07,206
That's right my friend
Old ham hands himself

1175
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:10,786
Very elegant affair,
should've seen her, lot of grandeur.

1176
01:32:10,821 --> 01:32:13,143
And not a single bug

1177
01:32:16,435 --> 01:32:20,227
And let's just say
some tears were shed.

1178
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:25,296
But I gotta say,
the best part of my day...

1179
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:27,537
is when I get thrown off the roof...

1180
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:31,277
because when the Nicelanders lift me up..

1181
01:32:31,901 --> 01:32:34,453
I get a perfect view of Sugar Rush

1182
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:37,207
And I can see Vanellope racing

1183
01:32:41,071 --> 01:32:42,774
The kid's a natural..

1184
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:46,024
And the players love her glitch and all

1185
01:32:46,222 --> 01:32:48,218
Just like I knew they would

1186
01:32:49,206 --> 01:32:53,287
Turns out I don't need a medal
to tell me I'm a good guy

1187
01:32:54,157 --> 01:32:56,946
Cause, if that little kid likes me...

1188
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:02,250
How bad can I be?

01:33:07,036 --> 01:33:12,548
