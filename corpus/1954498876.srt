BOY 1:
Don't be a pussy.

173
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,453
The thing about bullies is,
they're always gonna be there.

174
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,288
You understand?

175
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:20,418
All you have to do to end
a bully is bonk him on the nose.

176
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,002
That's it.

177
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,297
Even if you get in a fight later
and you lose the fight,

178
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,341
the fact that you were
that much trouble

179
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,634
means he's never gonna mess
with you again.

180
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,511
Now,
I know what you're saying.

181

"Dad, what if I do get
in a fight? How do I fight?"

182
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,352
Great question.
Let's show you. Okay?

183
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,482
When someone attacks you
and it's gonna go down,

184
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:47,486
you just gotta be super-fast
and go, "Oh, shit, here we go."

185
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,572
Employ a super-fast combination,
then get the hell out of there.

186
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,657
Because what that does
with the brain is,

187
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,452
it bonks it
against the skull.

188
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:57,162
And that does
way more damage than just boop.

189
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,580
You wanna go boo, boo, boo.

190
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,165
So the poor brain goes
bam, bam, bam.

191
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,502
And that's when you get
a pass out. Okay?

192
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,963
And it helps to use bad grammar.
It makes you sound tougher.

193
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,589

Right?

196
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,718
Now, once you know that,

197
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,804
once you have the basics
of fighting down,

198
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,348
all of a sudden,
bullies aren't so intimidating.

199
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,724
The fight isn't a big deal.

200
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,435

and then it's done.
It's just like diarrhea.

202
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,189
The way a dog
can smell fear,

203
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,066
a bully can smell
confidence.

204
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,402
Now, when you see a bully,
you're just sort of like,

than taking down a tough guy.

means "exactly." Okay?

There.
Your makeover is complete.

351
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,167
Thank you.

352
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,085
Let's just do
this top button here.

353
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,004
It makes you look
like a sexy murderer.

354
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,298
Heh.
Wow.

355
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,801
Do you need those glasses?
For reading and driving.

356
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,594
Okay, you shouldn't read
when you drive.

357
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,220
Oh, all right.

358
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,097
MARK:
This is a man.

359
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,557
Bryan came in here dressed

360
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,560
like a mentally ill assassin
at a sleepover

361
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,480
and he's leaving here a man.

362
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,525
You look good, buddy.
How do you feel?

363
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,444
Thanks, man.
I feel great.

364
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,156
How you feeling?

365
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,200
How do I feel?

366
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,787
I feel bad.

367
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,580
I'm dying.

368
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,960
I do think
she looks better.

369
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,171
It's funny, though,
how, like, they reformed them,

370
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,924
but she's wearing as much
eyeliner as she always was.

371
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,760
But at least she has, like,
a softer lip, which I like.

372
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,554
You can't do eyes and lip,
you know,

373
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,347
because then
it's just too much.

374
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,099
You gotta just pick one because,
otherwise, you're like--

375
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,352
It looks like you give BJs
on the first date, right?

376
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,854

MARGOT: Doesn't she look better?
Mm-hm.

00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,363

MARK:
<i>Okay, grooming for a man</i>

387
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:42,085
You take your soap bar,
you lather up your pubes.

388
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,587
That's how you get
a lather going,

389
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,256
with the friction, right?
Then take those suds

390
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:49,175
...and peel back your foreskin
and wash your head like that:

391
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,762
You do your balls.
You get down there, all right?

392
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:54,138
You turn around, you get
your ass crack, all right?

One armpit. Done.

396
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:04,023
No shower for a man should
be more than one minute long.

397
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,817
Oh, morning, honey.

398
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,318

399
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,153
I told you.
He's filming with me.

400
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,488
Why?

401
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:14,117
He's doing
a documentary on me.

402
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,911

That sounds boring?

407
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,544
You're saying
I'm boring?

408
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,548
Well, we're boring.
Sort of, yeah.

409
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,050
I don't know about you,
but I consider boring

410
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,177
to be about the worst thing
you can be.

411
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:37,641
Well, sorry, but that's what
you are now, so get used to it.

No more fart jokes?
Okay, got it.

I don't need two.

00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,914
Oh, okay. I get it now!
I'm boring and I'm a child!

basically insane!

I'm sorry.

This is your dad's office.

00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,475

00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:25,271
that's going throughout
the whole office.

431
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,315
I know it has
kind of a rapey vibe.

432
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,442
And I keep all my rapey vibes
in here,

433
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,444
so things don't get
too out of control.

434
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,364

of everything I own.

Hey, guys. I told you
about the documentary

437
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,541

Yeah. Yeah.

439
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,586
Whatever.
So great, we're all here.

Damages you might not
necessarily see cosmetically.

444
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,390
Can I do my thing? Because
I already have this nailed.

445
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,017
Great. Go.

00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,651
Okay. Guy's
at a used-car lot, right?

449
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,570
He's looking at cars,
dubious chap.

450
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,405
Hmm.
"I don't like that one."

451
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,741
Hmm. He's smart.
He knows what he's doing.

452
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,659
Then he sees this third car.

453
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,371
We don't acknowledge that it's
a hot chick in a car costume.

454
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,832
Okay, imagine these
if they were perfect tits.

455
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,584
And she's got that thing on

456
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,586
where, you know,
when you can't see correctly?

457
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,755
When you have a costume on,
you have to go like that:

458
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,008
I love--
That's comedy gold right there.

459
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,426
And so I look at her,

460
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,136
and I'm treating her
like any other car,

461
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,804
and I go, "You all right?"

462
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,724
And she goes,
"Yeah, fine. Fine."

463
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:46,770
And then we sort of draw out
a stare where I'm going:

464
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,647
And then
she's sort of going:

465
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,692
And then, bloop, some sweat
comes from her face, right?

466
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,736
And then I decide
to test my hunch and I go--

467
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,782
And I just start pushing
on her stomach, right?

468
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:02,911
And then, as I'm pushing, worst,
grossest, food poisoning fart.

469

You're kidding, right?

473
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,848
No.

Wait, are you kidding?

00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,229
Okay. All right, no, no.
I mean, that's--

It's fine for us
joking around in here,

00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,692

the client might think we--

00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,903
Well, they might question

1701
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:20,887
I was trying to record videos
for our unborn son

1702
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:23,973
so he'd have those
when he got older to live by.

1706
01:17:29,563 --> 01:17:31,481

and it was a stupid movie.

1707
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:34,401
I started out doing videos
for him as a young boy...

You didn't even see a doctor.

1709
01:17:36,486 --> 01:17:39,322

so I made a bunch of videos

1710
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:41,782
to show our son
what it's like to be a man.

1711
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:43,993

like playground stuff,

1713

I got into the party scene

1714
