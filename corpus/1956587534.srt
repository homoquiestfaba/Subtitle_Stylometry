I had a little chat
with the Father,

714
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,275

that none of us

I'm not spending my remaining
days on this earth in a bed,

727
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:19,742

medical breakthrough

728
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:23,879

Lisa, small towns
need doctors.

745

the town begins to die.
