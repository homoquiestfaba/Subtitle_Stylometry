- Perhaps.

- Oh, this is amazing.
- Let's see if there's something--

91
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:43,282
I seem to have landed
in some sort of Shangri-La here.

92
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:48,661
Some hidden world where angels walk
upon the surface of the earth.

93

no human heart may leave unscorched.

Well, Mr. Chenoux--
(Chuckles)

95
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,642
He just dropped out of the sky
like Daedalus.

96
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,975
- <i>Daedalus? Who's Daedalus?</i>
- Icarus.

97
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:08,448
- Daedalus was the father.
- I meant Icarus,

98
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:11,111
the one who flew
too close to the sun.

99
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:13,620
(Sighs) That's him?

100
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:17,352
<i>Except Icarus didn't have a sheepskin flying </i>
<i>helmet on or goggles or a big coat.</i>

101
00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:19,917
All he had on was a pair
of golden swimming trunks.

102
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:22,964
Fraser, don't use
language like that.

103
00:08:23,032 --> 00:08:25,193
''Swimming trunks''

104
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:29,363
Anyway, Icarus fell
and landed on his head...

105
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:31,872
and burst open and died.

106
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,807
We might well have something
up our sleeves for you.

107
00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:37,175
You know, even if I would have
found a place to land,

108
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:41,080
I would've had to send somebody
to Carlisle for a motor truck.

109
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,608
Well, we may not be at the forefront
of aerodynamical mechanics, Mr. Emperor,

110
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:47,451
but I'm sure my men can
rustle up an air filter...

111
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:49,684
<i>from available materials,</i>
<i>wouldn't you say, Jim?</i>

112
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:51,885
What would that be,
Mr. Pettigrew?

113
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,894
I was just thinking that
what might do the trick...

114
00:08:53,962 --> 00:08:58,296
in terms of replacing the air filter
might well be some of our Sphagnum.

115
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,426
Sphagnum?

116
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:03,596
You are, at this moment, Mr. Emperor,
privileged to be standing...

117
00:09:03,672 --> 00:09:06,038
in the only Sphagnum
moss factory in Europe.

118
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:08,474
- And the biggest.
- And the best.

119
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:12,310
<i>My father invented and patented</i>
<i>the Pettigrew Power Intensifier.</i>

120
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:16,044
Did he, you say?
Flabbergasting.

121
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:18,848
- <i>Flabbergasting.</i>
- It fits onto the carburetor.

122
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:22,254
Mr. Emperor, are you going to let
us have a ride in your airplane?

123
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:27,389
Well, I think it's up to
your father to say. Ask him.

124
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:29,897
<i>Dad, can I?</i>

125
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,502
<i>(Fraser narrating)</i>
<i>Dad says the view of Kiloran...</i>

126
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,413
<i>was a sight he would treasure</i>
<i>for the rest of his life...</i>

127
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:50,213
<i>and that we all</i>
<i>looked like bugs.</i>

128
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:54,381
<i>But he says I'm far too young</i>
<i>to go up in the plane.</i>

129
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:57,050
<i>It was seeing Kiloran from up</i>
<i>in the emperor's airplane...</i>

130
00:09:57,126 --> 00:09:59,686
<i>that gave him</i>
<i>one of his best ideas.</i>

131
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:07,792
<i>It was during the Great War that</i>
<i>we first started mining moss.</i>

132
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,395
<i>It was used for</i>
<i>putting on soldiers' wounds...</i>

133
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:13,134
<i>because it was ten times more</i>
<i>absorbent than cotton wool.</i>

134
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,403
<i>So when they were</i>
<i>horribly wounded,</i>

135
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:19,743
<i>it was</i> our <i>moss that soaked up </i>
<i> their blood and guts and everything.</i>

136
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:22,875
This is, by far,
the most effective solution.

137
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:26,546
You could see it so clearly from the airplane.
We reroute the moss trail through hillside,

138
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:28,783
and we save a three-mile journey
to the pressing plant.

139
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:31,223
Aye if you say so,
Mr. Pettigrew.

140
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:34,558
Just lay the charges, Andrew. Let me
worry about the logistical planning.

141
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,326
Good Lord. What's that buffoon
doing now, Mother?

142
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,232
<i>Let</i> me <i>handle this, Morris.</i>

143
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:43,567
- <i>Give us a hand with that, will you?</i>
- Edward!

144
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:47,803
<i>Edward!</i>

145
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:50,811
I don't think Mrs. Macintosh
will be too pleased.

146
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,612
Oh, that'll be the cavalry arrived. Master
Morris there--a right hard-nosed bugger.

147
00:10:55,684 --> 00:11:00,519
If I know Master Morris there'll be no more of
this damned foolish dynamiting nonsense.

148
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:03,149
He'll not be keen to see
his inheritance blown to pieces.

149
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:06,490
I have never
in all my born days...

150
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:09,622
witnessed such
irresponsible behavior.

151
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:12,258
The estate is not yours,
Edward, to go around...

152
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,895
destroying and exploding
without so much as by-your-leave.

153
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:19,463
And besides, you'll
frighten the sheep!

154
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,009
What makes you think
it's yours to blow up, Edward?

155
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:26,173
<i>Sheer bloody-minded</i>
<i>vandalism, I should say.</i>

156
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:33,052
<i>(Car doors slam, engine starts)</i>

157
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:40,160
Andrew, tell the men to pack up
when they've cleared this.

158
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:43,494
- We'll be doing no more blasting today.
-<i>Right, Mr. Pettigrew.</i>

159
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:51,038
-<i>Andrew Burns says it was a very good</i>
-<i> idea, Dad does he? Ah, well.</i>

160
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:54,166
Uncle Morris has rolled back
into town,

161
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:59,237
and Gamma thinks Uncle Morris knows
best when it comes to managing Kiloran,

162
00:11:59,314 --> 00:12:03,182
even though he lives 500 miles away and
only shows his face once in a blue moon.

163
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:05,652
I know. And he's
a right hard-nosed bugger.

164
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:09,623
- Fraser Pettigrew!
- What's a blue moon, Dad?

165
00:12:11,627 --> 00:12:15,654
- (Growling, barking)
- (Barking)

166
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,162
<i>(Fraser narrating)</i>
<i>My dad has two obsessions</i>.'

167
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:23,397
<i>Beethoven and the Bible.</i>

168
00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:27,875
-<i>As usual, every Sunday,we have to listen
to him preach.</i> - Mens sana in corpore sano--

169
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:33,208
-<i>a healthy mind in a healthy body.</i>
- (Giggling)

170
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:37,446
<i>But what is it we mean when</i>
<i>we speak of a healthy mind?</i>

171
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,388
- We mean a direct, manly attitude
towards our faith. - (Whimpering)

172
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:46,791
<i>Now, I take my text today from the words </i>
<i>of the glorious hymn by William Blake</i>.'

173
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:51,959
<i>''Bring me my bow of burning gold,</i>
<i>Bring me my arrows of desire''</i>

00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:57,402
<i>Uncle Morris says our minister's</i>
<i>liver is going to explode.</i>

176
00:12:57,472 --> 00:13:01,568
<i>But if you're a minister, you'll go</i>
<i>straight to heaven, won't you?</i>

177
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:05,170
Dad, when people die
and go to heaven,

178
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:07,340
does everybody get
a house of their own?

179
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,350
- To live in?
- Uh-huh.

180
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:14,151
Well, heaven is like living in the place
you love best for all eternity.

181
00:13:14,222 --> 00:13:17,020
So it'd be just like staying here,
then, wouldn't it?

182
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,492
It'd be like
not dying at all.

183
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:23,657
Fraser, that's very poetically put,
and it's very apt.

184
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:25,757
I was just thinking something
along those lines myself...

185
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:28,029
<i>about the nature of home.</i>

186
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:30,037
Don't forget to wash
your hands, now, Finlay.

187
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:34,041
§In pastures green§

188
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:36,509
(Grunts, sighs)

189
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:40,047
Magnificent.

190
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:43,448
Norwegian pine,
Sitka spruce.

191
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:47,215
- What are they, Uncle Morris?
- Commercial softwoods.

192
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:51,851
- What's a commercial softwood? - It's what your
father should be planting instead of his moss.

193
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:55,385
Trees for the paper
and timber industry,

194
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:59,195
not handfuls of sphagnum moss
from out of a filthy bog.

195
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:01,861
<i>(Woman)</i>
<i>You'll miss Sunday lunch!</i>

196
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:05,236
Ah. Come on-- lunch.

197
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:07,434
Donald, Finlay, come on-- lunch!

198
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:10,535
- <i>I'm coming, Mr. Macintosh! I'm coming,</i>
<i>Uncle Morris! I'm coming!</i>

199
00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:13,274
<i>(Fraser narrating) My uncle Morris</i>
<i>had made his fortune in Liverpool...</i>

200
00:14:13,348 --> 00:14:18,615
<i>and his home in London, when he wasn't</i>
<i>nightclubbing around Paris and Monte Carlo.</i>

201
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:21,315
<i>He always brings the latest</i>
<i>jazz records with him,</i>

202
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,723
<i>mostly to irritate my father.</i>

203
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:27,819
<i>One time I heard him tell my dad</i>
<i>that he'd kick us out of Kiloran...</i>

204
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:31,992
<i>once he'd inherited it, and that we'd</i>
<i>have to live in the moss factory.</i>

205
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:35,161
<i>But Dad said Uncle Morris</i>
<i>was only kidding.</i>

206
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:37,705
<i>We reckon he's a good laugh,</i>
<i>our uncle Morris.</i>

207
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:40,765
Who's this? Who's this?
(Hiccuping)

208
00:14:40,842 --> 00:14:44,437
- Reverend Finlayson!
- (Laughing) Yes!

209
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:46,845
- Good!
- I saw him drinking out of the Bible.

210
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:50,043
Oh! He had a drink
out of the Good Book, did he?

211
00:14:50,118 --> 00:14:53,349
- (Laughing)
- Oh, well, there you are.

212
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:57,290
Here, I think I'll sit here a moment.
Hold this, Finlay.

213
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:59,725
Gamma doesn't let Father
smoke in the house.

214
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:01,660
My father smokes
wherever he wants.

215
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,096
He used to have to ask
my mother, but now he doesn't.

216
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:09,903
Uncle Morris, do you have to do everything
you're told by Gamma Macintosh as well?

217
00:15:09,971 --> 00:15:13,771
(Chuckles) Ooh, absolutely,
without a shadow of doubt,

218
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:17,676
- and seek permission for any new venture.
- What new venture?

219
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:21,876
Well, let's say for instance--
just for an example--

220
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,215
say I was of a mind
to get married.

221
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:29,747
<i>If old Mrs. Macintosh said no, would you</i>
<i>have to tell your betrothed it was all off?</i>

222
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:33,056
Well, let's just suppose
that my prospective wife...

223
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:35,892
was a good deal younger
than I am,

224
00:15:35,964 --> 00:15:38,455
and she just happened
to be French.

225
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:41,400
Is she very beautiful?

226
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,529
Oh, yes.

227
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:45,903
Oh, yes, Finlay.

228
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:48,067
Is she as beautiful
as my mother?

229
00:15:48,143 --> 00:15:50,873
(Chuckling) You think Moira's
beautiful, huh?

230
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:53,938
- My wee sister, beautiful? (Laughs)
- Of course I do.

231
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:56,745
Father says, ''My, my, you're looking
beautiful today.

232
00:15:56,818 --> 00:15:59,218
Fancy slipping upstairs
for a slank, Moira?''

233
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:02,347
- A slank? Is that what he says?
- (Boys laugh)

234
00:16:02,424 --> 00:16:06,758
- I must remember that.
''Slip upstairs for a slank'' - What? What?

235
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:08,989
- (Laughing)
- Why's that funny? What?

236
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:11,828
Mister says,
''Fancy a wee slank, Missus?''

237
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,368
''Time for a slank''
''Thank you for a slank-you''

238
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:16,267
(Both) Slank you, bank you,
ank you, slank you!

239
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:23,304
The accounts are a shambles, Mother.

240
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:28,441
Then income from this nonsensical
moss business is a pittance.

241
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:34,012
All Dad's investment in this estate
is just... dribbling away.

242
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:36,455
- (Kissing sounds)
-<i>(Edward) Right!</i>

243
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:39,494
<i>Boys, six breaths!</i>

244
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:42,962
- <i>One, two, three, four,</i>
- Just look at him.

245
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:45,226
five, six!

246
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,794
Let's go!
Come on, gird your loins!

247
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:52,339
(All barking)

248
00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:07,687
You're all bonkers!
(Chuckling)

249
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:11,817
I mean, all this running around
naked and dog behavior.

250
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:16,557
(Chuckling) There may be a bit
of a fool in Edward, but he's a kind fool.

251
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:19,759
Kiloran isn't a business,
Morris. It's our home.

252
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:22,632
Your father understood that
better than anyone.

253
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:26,504
Edward worships Moira,
and Moira adores him.

254
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:29,703
You're just an old softy,
Mother.

255
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:32,713
- Good Lord! Stoddard, isn't it?
- Aye, Mr. Morris.

256
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:35,215
- Didn't I dismiss you last summer?
- (Chuckles)

257
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:38,514
- Mr. Pettigrew brought you back,
did he? Typical. - Uh-huh.

258
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:42,148
You know, Mother, I think it's time
I sorted this place out.

259
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:46,490
I mean, it's just bedlam,
like a zoo!

260
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:49,496
(All barking)

261
00:17:49,564 --> 00:17:52,226
No, Daddy! Daddy, no!

262
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:55,929
Whoa!

263
00:17:58,306 --> 00:18:02,538
Procrastination only intensifies
the sensation of shock, boys!

264
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:05,375
I'm clean, Daddy, I promise you.
I'm very, very clean!

265
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:07,972
Ha-ha-ha!

266
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:11,712
<i>It's not healthy, Father.</i>
<i>Dr. Gebbie said I had to tell you.</i>

267
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:14,084
It could make your heart stop.

268
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:16,282
- I'm gonna run and hide in the woods.
- Fraser, no!

269
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:18,622
Fraser, come back!

270
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:27,462
- (Growling)
- (Screaming)

271
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:32,029
- (Whimpering)
-<i>(Fraser) That was the first</i>
<i>time that I saw the hairy man.</i>

272
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:34,541
(Screaming)

273
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:40,445
- <i>No one else saw him. He must
have been a figment.</i> - (Shouting)

274
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:43,211
<i>Anyway, I think he was</i>
<i>more frightened than I am.</i>

275
00:18:44,953 --> 00:18:48,252
<i>If you plant a boiler house and</i>
<i>a chimney stack there, Edward,</i>

276
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:51,417
You will disfigure Kiloran beyond repair.

277
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:53,927
And if you put a chimney there,
dear, the smoke will blow...

278
00:18:53,995 --> 00:18:57,055
into the nursery, dear--
we'll poison our children.

279
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:02,102
Uh-huh.

280
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:06,807
Aha!

281
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:13,845
The Pettigrew Draft-Assisted
Horizontal Underground Fume Extractor.

282
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:27,151
(Chuckles) Brilliant, Mr. Pettigrew!

283
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:29,719
<i>(Gamma) Really, Moira.</i>
<i>The man's mad.</i>

284
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:33,666
Who ever heard of a chimney
under the lawn?

285
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:37,535
Edward's terribly practical,
Mother. I'm sure it'll work.

286
00:19:42,711 --> 00:19:45,839
What, and this is for insulating
all the new central heating pipes?

287
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:50,317
- That's right, Andrew.
- I've never seen anything like it in my puff!

288
00:19:50,385 --> 00:19:54,185
Aye, and they've decided
to call it ''asbestos''

289
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:57,747
Oh! Tastes like
your mother's porridge.

290
00:19:59,928 --> 00:20:02,897
Oh!

291
00:20:02,964 --> 00:20:05,694
<i>Do you really have a fiancee,</i>
<i>Uncle Morris?</i>

292
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:09,168
- Do I what?
- Do you really have a fiancee, Uncle Morris?

293
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:11,831
Indeed, I do, Finlay.
Indeed, I do.

294
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:16,434
- Is she a secret?
- Well, she was until this afternoon.

295
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,844
What's her name, Uncle Morris,
and where did you meet her?

296
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:25,045
Her name is Heloise, and I suppose
I met her on a golf course.

297
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,315
<i>(Woman) Frog's legs</i>--
<i>that's another one.</i>

298
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:31,189
-<i>Also snails and slugs.</i>
-<i>Ugh!</i> -<i>Slugs?</i>

299
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:34,422
-<i>That's unbelievable.</i>
-<i>It's disgusting, you mean.</i>

300
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:39,991
<i>It's hardly likely, Katie, you would be expected </i>
<i>to perform French cookery for the woman.</i>

301
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:43,435
<i>Good, plain, Scottish fare</i>
<i>will have to do her.</i>

302
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:47,100
Finest food in the world--
none of your fancy trimmings...

303
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:49,109
- (Chuckles)
- or <i>garlic.</i>

304
00:20:49,177 --> 00:20:54,171
I ate garlic once. I was confined to my
bed for nearly a month with rheumatic pains,

305
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:58,208
- and even a little gout.
- You went to bed with a little goat, Marnie?

306
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:02,120
- (All laugh)
- No, dear. Not ''goat.''

307
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,023
I was confined to my bed
with a little ''gout''

308
00:21:08,596 --> 00:21:11,759
Is it true Mr. Morris met his
fiancee on his golfing tour?

309
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:16,634
Apparently she was playing
in a dance band.

310
00:21:16,704 --> 00:21:19,434
<i>Oh, he's a great one for the dancin',</i>
<i>our Master Morris.</i>

311
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:25,207
- Playing what?
- Well, apparently, it was a musical instrument.

312
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,407
<i>Maybe a glockenspiel?</i>

313
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:30,940
<i>(Fraser) She plays a French cello,</i>
<i>and her name is Heloise.</i>

314
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:35,046
- Aha? The French cello, Master Fraser?
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

315
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:38,490
Uncle Morris was having a whiskey 
and soda to buck up his spirits...

316
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,791
after losing to a dreadful bogie on the 17th,

317
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:45,230
when this beautiful music
wafted into the room.

318
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:50,829
He went through to see what it was, and he
saw Heloise bowing her cello in the French trio.

319
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:53,635
<i>And he said to himself</i>
<i>there and then,</i>

320
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,074
''That's <i>the girl for you,</i>
<i>Morris, my boy''</i>

321
00:21:56,144 --> 00:22:00,808
<i>He asked the leader of the trio if the</i>
<i>lovely cellist would play him a solo.</i>

322
00:22:00,882 --> 00:22:03,214
He requested
<i>''Le Cygne''</i> by Saint-Saens...

323
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:06,276
'cause he knew it was French,
and he wanted to impress her.

324
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:11,792
<i>The very next day he took her to Robbie</i>
<i>Burns' cottage for a cream tea...</i>

325
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,660
and asked her if she'd do him
the honor of becoming his wife.

326
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,929
Oh! I think that's so lovely,
so sad as well.

327
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:24,301
- I think that makes you want to weep!
-<i>Get a hold of yourself, Sarah.</i>

328
00:22:24,372 --> 00:22:27,500
What was it again that Mr. Morris asked
his fiancée to play for him, Master Fraser?

329
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:29,873
<i>''Le Cygne'',</i> which means ''the swan.''

330
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:32,674
-<i>It's French for ''swan''</i>
- (Weeping) That is so beautiful!

331
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:36,239
''The swan'' Would that be a song you
would know yourself, Fraser?

332
00:22:36,317 --> 00:22:39,013
Uh-huh. Mumsie has it
on a gramophone recording.

333
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:41,282
It's this:

- Thank you so much.

338
00:23:46,254 --> 00:23:51,248
- I see you're wearing the choker. - I wonder
whether you and I might have a talk, Mother.

339
00:23:52,327 --> 00:23:55,353
You could just see that swan.

340
00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:00,197
It would be my pleasure to conduct you on a
personal tour of the Pettigrew world of moss.

341
00:24:00,268 --> 00:24:02,759
- I'd like that very much. Thank you
so much. - That was lovely.

342
00:24:02,837 --> 00:24:05,271
- I adored it! It was lovely.
- Uncle Morris?

343
00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:09,469
What, Fraser?

344
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:11,478
Good luck, Uncle Morris.

345
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:19,009
The moss itself has properties which are one
at the same time both antiseptic and--

346
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:22,284
- Sphagnum is ten times more
absorbent than cotton wool. - Oh!

347
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:24,791
These women we see here are
the cutters and the balers.

<i>(Woman) Afternoon,</i>
<i>Mr. Pettigrew, sir.</i>

349
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:35,667
Ahey, Cyric! Brawn, bonny afternoon
of it we're having, my lassie!

350
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:37,762
(Chuckling)

351
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,242
It's an advantage to have a working
knowledge of the local vernacular.

352
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,438
- The cutters and the balers--
- The cutters have the job of cutting the moss.

353
00:24:45,513 --> 00:24:48,141
- And the balers--
- The balers have the job of doing the baling.

354
00:24:48,216 --> 00:24:50,150
- Fraser--
- Oh!

355
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,113
A considerable quantity of water has
to be removedfrom the moss...

356
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,023
- before it can be racked
in the drying shed-- - For drying!

357
00:24:59,093 --> 00:25:02,494
And we made cigars
from the dried moss. Didn't we, Dad?

358
00:25:04,232 --> 00:25:06,723
It is not one of our better ideas.

359
00:25:08,803 --> 00:25:11,704
- (Whispering) Hey, Fraser.
- (Both laughing)

360
00:25:11,773 --> 00:25:15,937
Now, this is just taking
some soap down to the cottage.

361
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:20,544
- (Laughing) Oh!
- Just one of my little--

362
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:23,778
- What's this?
- Father made it himself.

363
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:26,718
- Now, what we have here is the, uh--
- (Speaking French)

364
00:25:26,788 --> 00:25:29,018
A little storeroom shop
we have here.

365
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,993
- We might be able to knock up
a couple of little selections--
-<i>(Heloise laughing)</i>

366
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,491
- Look! There's Jim Menries.
- Hello!

367
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:44,504
He's our blacksmith. He's so strong
he can crack things in half.

368
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:47,302
<i>Oh, that's very impressive.</i>

369
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,809
Mmm!

370
00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:52,004
(Laughing)

371
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:55,315
(Laughing) Oh! Oh!

372
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,028
Is all the moss factory
your father's invention, Fraser?

373
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:17,868
All of it, everything! It's the only moss
factory in the entire continent of Europe.

374
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:20,169
Mmm, he's a very clever man,
your father.

375
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,903
I know. He's an inventor
and a genius.

376
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:25,104
Mmm.

377
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:27,204
What a beautiful scent.

378
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:30,739
<i>It reminds me</i>
<i>of when we would catch...</i>

379
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:35,949
<i>ecrevisses</i> in the river and wrap
them in moss to bring them home...

380
00:26:36,023 --> 00:26:39,049
- when I was your age.
- What age are you now, miss?

381
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:42,288
Hmm.

382
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:49,625
I'm 24, but don't tell
your grandmother.

383
00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:51,604
What are <i>ecrevisses</i>?

384
00:26:51,672 --> 00:26:54,698
Ecrevisses <i>are crayfish,</i>

385
00:26:54,776 --> 00:26:56,710
ignorant little boy,

386
00:26:57,845 --> 00:27:01,406
a species of miniature
freshwater lobster.

387
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:03,916
And very delicious to eat.

388
00:27:03,985 --> 00:27:06,249
- I-I knew that, Father. I meant--
- Well, Fraser,

389
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,120
I think you've pestered Heloise with your
silly, irritating prattle quite long enough...

390
00:27:10,191 --> 00:27:12,421
- for one afternoon.
- I haven't!

391
00:27:14,228 --> 00:27:18,255
You're severely testing my patience.
Can you not see Heloise is bored stiff?

392
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:21,028
- Now, up to the house. Up to the house!
- But Dad--

393
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:30,441
I'd like you to accept this small gift
as a souvenir of my moss factory.

394
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:35,949
Soap, cologne and
a soothing unguent of sphagnum.

395
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:45,186
It's <i>you</i> that's irritating,
and it's <i>you</i> that's pestering,

396
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:47,819
-<i>and it's</i> you <i>that's ignorant!</i>
- Ah, Fraser!

397
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:50,762

<i>man to shake your favorite uncle's hand?</i>

I hate him!

399
00:27:53,835 --> 00:27:56,998
Fraser! What happened?
What's the matter?

400
00:27:57,071 --> 00:28:02,600
That boy is getting out of control. His father
had better take a firmer hand with him.

<i>out of Grandpa Macintosh's secret books.</i>

<i>In one of the books,</i>
Greek Mythology,

515
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:35,650
<i>there's a lovely picture of a lady and </i>
<i>a swan, which is</i> ''le cygne'' <i>in French.</i>

00:36:50,104 --> 00:36:55,633
<i>I found an article about a thing</i>
<i>called ''prostitution''  read it three times.</i>

519
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:59,509
<i>It's one of the most interesting</i>
<i>things I've ever come across.</i>

520
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:05,246
<i>There aren't just secret books, there are </i>
<i>also secret engravings hidden in them.</i>

521
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:08,311
<i>These are mainly of Belgian ladies</i>
<i>with all their clothes off,</i>

522
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:10,880
<i>which is called being</i>
<i>''in dishabille''</i>

523
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,188
<i>Also in</i>
<i>the</i> Encyclopedia of Ethics,

524
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,752
<i>it says what to do if you accidentally</i>
<i>see pictures like these.</i>

525
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:30,503
<i>What's really great about learning</i>
<i>the manly art of fishing is...</i>

526
00:37:30,577 --> 00:37:35,071
<i>that it gives you loads of time to think about </i>
<i> what you've read in the secret library,</i>

527
00:37:35,149 --> 00:37:39,245
<i>and the books give you loads of things </i>
<i> to think about while you're fishing.</i>

528
00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:48,926
<i>And that's why my dad</i>
<i>wants me out of the attic</i>--

529
00:37:48,996 --> 00:37:51,396
<i>because he doesn't want me</i>
<i>to know anything.</i>

530
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,894
<i>It probably suits him if I'm ignorant and don't </i>
<i>know about the things he knows about,</i>

531
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:01,566
<i>like the naked ladies</i>
<i>in Grandpa Macintosh's library.</i>

532
00:38:01,642 --> 00:38:05,738
<i>Well, now</i> I <i>probably know</i>
<i>more about naked ladies than</i> he <i>does.</i>

Come on.
Come on, Doggit.

00:38:10,617 --> 00:38:14,348
So then if we knock that wall down there
and extend three yards that way,

535
00:38:14,421 --> 00:38:16,912
then we'll have room
for the drying machines to--

536
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,323
- I love this moss.
- So do I.

537
00:38:21,462 --> 00:38:23,396
It's like a perfume.

538
00:38:23,464 --> 00:38:26,058
- Morris, of course, hates it.
- No, he doesn't.

539
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:29,967
He wants to destroy it, all of it.
He has no soul, your fiance.

540
00:38:30,037 --> 00:38:33,165
- He has no romance in his soul.
- Edward.

- like-like you did with, uh, Fraser?
- What?

545
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:51,981
You know, how you rewarded him
for, uh, throwing moss.

546
00:38:53,494 --> 00:38:55,428
Fraser's a child.

547
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:04,796
And you-- Morris'
child-bride-to-be?

548

Edward-- (Laughing)
I don't want this talk.

549
00:39:12,846 --> 00:39:15,872

-<i>(Knocking)</i> - Yes?

00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:44,503

555

<i>but Jim's just arrived from the station</i>
<i>with what looks like more guests.</i>

<i>Oh, yes. It's Hector</i>
<i>and Lillian. Good.</i>

558
00:39:53,887 --> 00:39:58,722

Ah!

562
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:20,212
Hm.

563
00:40:22,015 --> 00:40:26,577
- We'll just, uh, put these back in
the study, will we? - Why?

564
00:40:26,653 --> 00:40:30,180
Oh, you know how Gamma
is about strong drink.

565
00:40:30,257 --> 00:40:33,420
Not that I disagree myself, especially
with Mr. Finlayson at dinner.

566
00:40:33,493 --> 00:40:37,054
Why don't you just leave them
where they were, in fact, Edward?

567
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:40,395
Wouldn't want to appear inhospitable.

568
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:52,575
<i>Edward,</i>
<i>this moss business</i>--

569
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,814
What about the moss?

570
00:40:55,882 --> 00:41:00,046
If you're going to manage this place properly,
you'll have to come up with a better scheme--

571
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,022
<i>something that's</i>
<i>more realistic, less childish.</i>

572
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:07,754
What's childish about the sphagnum moss
processing factory?

573
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:10,296
<i>Just look at yourself.</i>
<i>You're a grown man.</i>

574
00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:12,457
You're still walking around the place...

575
00:41:12,532 --> 00:41:15,933
with hanks of the stuff hanging off of
your clothes and sticking out of your hair.

576
00:41:16,003 --> 00:41:18,437
Yeah. (Chuckling)

577
00:41:18,505 --> 00:41:21,235
Look at that.
You can't get away from it.

578
00:41:21,308 --> 00:41:24,402
There'll have to be some
serious changes here--

579
00:41:24,478 --> 00:41:27,572
some cutbacks and the like.

580
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:29,980
What are you getting at, Morris?

581
00:41:31,418 --> 00:41:33,818
You're so busy wheeling and dealing,
making your money...

582
00:41:33,887 --> 00:41:36,321
that you forgotten
that we're a family here--

583
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,324
a happy family.

-<i>Morris!</i>

590
00:42:10,357 --> 00:42:12,518
A couple of desperados
up from the big city.

591
00:42:12,592 --> 00:42:14,890
- (Laughing)
- Morris, darling.

592

<i>Heloise! There you are.</i>

00:42:20,701 --> 00:42:23,693
Are you all right?

595
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,672
<i>Come on, I want you to meet some </i>
<i>friends. This is Billy and Hector.</i>

596
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:30,869
- This is Heloise,
- Enchante. Bonjour.

597
00:42:30,944 --> 00:42:34,277
my exotic child fiancee.

598
00:42:39,186 --> 00:42:41,984
Listen! You'll never believe
this in a million years.

599
00:42:42,055 --> 00:42:46,355
- It's for disemboweling deer. Look!
- Shh, Fraser. What, Sissie?

600
00:42:46,426 --> 00:42:50,658
One of Mr. Morris' friends is a woman
dressed up as a man, called Billy.

601
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:53,564
Only his real name's Lillian--
her name, I mean.

602
00:42:53,633 --> 00:42:55,897
What do you mean,
dressed up as a man called Billy?

603
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:58,199
You mean like a cowboy?
You mean like Billy the Kid?

604
00:42:58,271 --> 00:43:00,569
- You mean like fancy dress?
- Is it like a costume?

605
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,236
No, that's how she's dressed--
as if she was really a man in real life.

606
00:43:05,312 --> 00:43:08,076
(Grunting) Probably a lesbian.

607
00:43:09,616 --> 00:43:13,382
Master Fraser, you'll get skinned alive
for language like that.

608
00:43:13,453 --> 00:43:15,921
<i>They generally come</i>
<i>from the Greek island of Lesbos...</i>

609
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:20,050
- and are called lesbians for that reason.
- Oh, Master Fraser!

610
00:43:20,127 --> 00:43:22,061
Language like what, Sarah?

611
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:25,724
I never said a word! It's him 
should get his mouth washed out!

612
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:30,827
Although I don't think Billy or Lillian
Are traditional Greek names.

613
00:43:30,904 --> 00:43:32,838
There's no chance
one of you young lovelies...

614
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:35,932
might find it in their hearts
to iron these for me, is there?

615
00:43:38,645 --> 00:43:43,105
<i>(Woman) Crawford saw Jesus</i>
<i>on the lawn this morning.</i>

616
00:43:43,183 --> 00:43:46,209
- On the lawn.
- Who?

617
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:50,689
Jesus--just right out there on the lawn.

618
00:43:50,757 --> 00:43:52,691
Jesus Christ!

619
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,456
(Sighs) Didn't you, Crawford?

620
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,464
Uh-huh.

621
00:43:58,532 --> 00:44:01,763
Jesus walked across the loch
and over the lawn towards the house.

622
00:44:01,835 --> 00:44:06,499
<i>Was Jesus by any chance</i>
<i>wearing a pair of Edward's...</i>

623
00:44:06,573 --> 00:44:09,667
semi-submersible,
vulcanized pantaloons?

624

<i>(All laugh)</i>

625
00:44:13,046 --> 00:44:15,071
I know who you mean.

626
00:44:15,148 --> 00:44:17,844
I've seen him too. I saw him
down in the moss factory this morning...

627
00:44:17,918 --> 00:44:21,115
-<i>when the lady screamed.</i>
-<i>(Gamma) Who screamed?</i>

628
00:44:21,188 --> 00:44:26,251
<i>Fraser, Jesus doesn't like little boys</i>
<i>who tell wicked fibs.</i>

629
00:44:26,326 --> 00:44:29,454
- Sorry, Gamma, but--
- Sometimes Jesus might forgive a fib...

630
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:32,089
if it's to protect a loved one
from harm, Fraser.

631
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:37,296
<i>No. If you claim to be a Christian, </i>
<i>and you tell a lie, you are a hypocrite...</i>

632
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,429
<i>and not a Christian.</i>

633
00:44:39,506 --> 00:44:44,000
<i>You can't do a bad thing and be a good </i>
<i>man. You can't have it both ways.</i>

634
00:44:44,077 --> 00:44:48,707
Now, who can I help
to a little glass of this claret?

635
00:44:50,283 --> 00:44:53,309
- Minster, you'll not object to keeping
Morris company... -<i>Oh!</i>

636
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:55,513
- amongst all these abstemious souls?
- Well--

637
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:59,150
- No, there is a wedding to celebrate.
- Well, really, I don't like to--

638
00:44:59,226 --> 00:45:03,128
<i>I really don't think I should.</i>
<i>O-O-O-On the other hand</i>--

639
00:45:03,196 --> 00:45:07,064
(Stammering) I wouldn't like to--

640
00:45:09,469 --> 00:45:14,805
Sissie, you must tell Mrs. Henderson her
cock-a-leekie soup's a triumph.

641
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:18,140
<i>I think it's meant to be</i>
<i>cream of asparagus, ma'am.</i>

642
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:21,146
Your trifle ready
for the cream yet, Sarah?

643
00:45:21,214 --> 00:45:24,206
Says sherry first,
then whip cream, Mrs. Henderson.

644
00:45:24,284 --> 00:45:27,048
Oh! Right.

645
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,884
You may fetch some sherry
from the cellar.

646
00:45:34,094 --> 00:45:37,791
-<i>(Bell rings)</i>
- Oh, right, girls-- vegetables.
Sissie, you're neeps.

647
00:45:37,864 --> 00:45:40,662
I'm potatoes. Aggie, you can be
Brussels sprouts. Come on, come on!

648
00:45:40,734 --> 00:45:43,726
(Pounds table, slurs speech)
It's the scandal of the thing.

649
00:45:43,803 --> 00:45:48,968
-<i>Terrible suffering of the families.</i>
- Oh, God, he's off.

650
00:45:49,042 --> 00:45:53,706
Miners have seen their wages
actually cut in half.

651
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:58,479
It's no wonder they threaten
to withdraw labor.

652
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:08,291
I believe I hear talk that there's to
be a bonspiel at Kiloran this winter...

653
00:46:08,361 --> 00:46:10,795
<i>in honor of the newlyweds.</i>

654
00:46:10,864 --> 00:46:15,392
- Who shall blame them? -<i>Who, indeed,
Mr. Finlayson?</i> <i>Who, indeed?</i>

655
00:46:15,468 --> 00:46:18,631
-<i>Edward?</i>
- Well, if the Lord sees fit to bless us...

656
00:46:18,705 --> 00:46:23,506
with three inches of deep black ice, that's
exactly what we'll be having, Sir David.

657
00:46:23,576 --> 00:46:25,976
What is this bonspiel, Morris?

658
00:46:26,046 --> 00:46:28,742
Curling-- slippery bowling.

659
00:46:28,815 --> 00:46:31,875
It's the Scottish nation's
greatest gift to the world-- (Chuckles)

660
00:46:31,952 --> 00:46:33,886
after golf, that is.

661
00:46:33,954 --> 00:46:37,185
Ah, it's a game, I see.

662
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:42,151
(Gamma) Mrs. Henderson,
you've excelled yourself.

663
00:46:43,296 --> 00:46:46,322
It's rarely she manages
anything so good.

664
00:46:46,399 --> 00:46:49,664
- So, are dogs allowed in? Yes.
- To heaven?

665
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:54,036
- Dogs-- perfectly free of sin
in their hearts. - Of course.

666
00:46:54,107 --> 00:46:59,875
So heaven is full of
people's pets that have died...

667
00:46:59,946 --> 00:47:02,073
and gone to wait for them.

668
00:47:02,148 --> 00:47:05,174
The Christian faith
is a very muscular thing, Heloise.

669
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:08,948
- It isn't damaged by ridicule.
It's much stronger than-- - Temptation.

670
00:47:09,022 --> 00:47:13,015
Than duty? Than what?
What is it stronger than?

671
00:47:13,093 --> 00:47:15,527
- What about stoats?
- Quiet, Fraser.

672
00:47:15,595 --> 00:47:19,691
- Yes, what about stoats?
- I'm sorry to say that stoats are vermin.

673
00:47:19,766 --> 00:47:25,227
- In your eyes, not in the eyes of
 other stoats. - In the eyes of God.

674
00:47:25,305 --> 00:47:29,799
<i>No, I'll have another wee spoonful</i>
<i>of that, if you don't mind, Sissie.</i>

675
00:47:29,876 --> 00:47:34,313
But why would any god
deliberately create vermin?

676
00:47:34,381 --> 00:47:38,112
They seem to be doomed to eternal
damnation simply for being true...

677
00:47:38,184 --> 00:47:40,118
<i>to their own nature.</i>

678
00:47:40,186 --> 00:47:43,815
Because, by their nature,
some creatures are beyond redemption.

679
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:48,122
<i>Creatures? How would we define</i>
<i>a creature?</i>

680
00:47:48,194 --> 00:47:50,389
Would <i>I</i> qualify
as a creature, perhaps?

681
00:47:50,463 --> 00:47:53,557
<i>A stoat is not a creature,</i>
<i>miss.</i>

682
00:47:53,633 --> 00:47:58,195
A stoat is a wild beast
of woods and fields,

683
00:47:58,271 --> 00:48:00,501
just like our Fraser.

684
00:48:00,573 --> 00:48:02,768
<i>(All laugh)</i>

685
00:48:02,842 --> 00:48:06,505

- She's on her fourth helping.

686
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:09,912
- What? Fourth helping?
- The trifle. I can't get it off her.

687
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,111
No--
not my sherry trifle.

688
00:48:13,186 --> 00:48:15,279
- (Snickering)
- Oh, my God!

689
00:48:15,355 --> 00:48:18,791
<i>(Edward) I think it's the sweet sherry</i>
<i>that sort of allows it</i>--

690
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:22,453
<i>(Morris) That's utter nonsense,</i>
<i>Edward. It's amontillado.</i>

691
00:48:22,529 --> 00:48:24,997
- <i>My father wouldn't have</i>
<i>sweet sherry in this house.</i> - (Hiccups)

692
00:48:28,902 --> 00:48:33,168
<i>Perhaps Heloise and I could</i>
<i>perform, Mr. Finlayson,</i>

693
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:35,935
raise funds for the families
of your poor miners.

694
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:40,309
What a very Christian idea.
And what will you perform?

695
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,476
-<i>A duet, perhaps?</i>
-<i>(Fraser) Prostitution!</i>

696
00:48:45,552 --> 00:48:47,577
No, really.
It's perfect.

697
00:48:47,654 --> 00:48:50,623
Mumsie and Aunt Heloise
could be prostitutes.

698
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,558
<i>They could attend to our urgent needs and earn </i>
<i>a considerable fortune for the miners.</i>

699
00:48:54,627 --> 00:48:58,723
They could service my dad
and Uncle Morris and anybody else...

700
00:48:58,798 --> 00:49:02,666
- who could afford their lubricious ministrations.
-<i>(Gasping)</i>

701
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:09,702
<i>Fraser, go to my study</i>
<i>and wait for me there.</i>

702
00:49:09,776 --> 00:49:12,870
What? Why?
Wh-What's wrong?

703

We're all of us prostitutes
in some manner or other.

707
00:49:40,573 --> 00:49:44,202
That's what my Samuel
used to say in business.

Is that fully and completely
understood, young man?

749
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,213
I'm sorry, Gamma.

750
00:53:16,289 --> 00:53:20,055
Gamma, when you die and give

Anyway, I'm very far
from dead, you know?

755
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:40,479
- But I thought you'd stopped breathing
and died. - I know you did, Fraser.

756

That's why we don't sneak into ladies'
bedrooms without knocking first.

the asbestos slagging.

792
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:52,906
- (Gamma) You've dug your own
grave this time! - (Coughing)

793
00:55:52,979 --> 00:55:55,573
Now, out of the draft and
underneath those covers, Fraser.

794
00:55:55,648 --> 00:55:57,582
(Edward) Damn and blast!

795
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:00,744
(Andrew) You know how Mrs. Macintosh
feels about smoking around the house, sir.

796
00:56:05,725 --> 00:56:08,922
Fraser, where on earth
did this come from?

797
00:56:08,995 --> 00:56:12,624
The moss factory. I think Auntie
Heloise must have lost it.

798
00:56:12,698 --> 00:56:15,895
<i>I'll have him boiled alive</i>
<i>in his own juices!</i>

799
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:19,964
(Coughing)

800
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,565
Moira? What's the matter, love?

801
00:56:23,643 --> 00:56:27,739
Oh, don't be silly, dear.
I'm only wanting to give him a fright.

802
00:56:42,828 --> 00:56:45,262
<i>(Electric motor starts)</i>

803
00:56:52,772 --> 00:56:55,935
(Chuckles) Hmm.

804
00:56:56,008 --> 00:56:59,774
Rotary Screen Mark III seems
a little bit brighter, don't you think?

805
00:57:01,414 --> 00:57:05,214
So, Fraser, what do you think
of the camera work?

806
00:57:05,284 --> 00:57:08,117
<i>(Fraser)</i>
<i>Oh, it's very good.</i>

807
00:57:08,187 --> 00:57:10,655
-<i>Look! Here's Heloise and Elspeth!</i>
-<i>Yeah.</i>

808
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:25,199
<i>(Edward) Oh, there's Mumsie.</i>
<i>Wave to Mumsie!</i>

809
00:57:43,322 --> 00:57:45,916
-<i>Why is jazz horrible, Dad?</i>
-<i>Contact!</i>

810
00:57:47,326 --> 00:57:49,988
-<i>Lack of moral fiber.</i>
-<i>Not like Beethoven.</i>

811
00:57:50,062 --> 00:57:52,462
<i>That's exactly right, Fraser. Contact!</i>

812
00:57:52,531 --> 00:57:56,365
<i>Beethoven is upright and honest, whereas jazz </i>
<i>is sneaky and treacherous and effeminate...</i>

813
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:58,699
-<i>and just plain foreign.</i> -<i>(Andrew)</i>
<i>Have you got it switched on?</i>

814
00:57:58,771 --> 00:58:02,002
Of course I've got it switched on.
What do you think I mean by ''contact''?

815
00:58:02,074 --> 00:58:07,137
- Auntie Heloise likes jazz.
- Yes, well, Auntie Heloise is particularly French,

816
00:58:07,213 --> 00:58:10,774
and French ladies don't understand 
the first thing about moral fiber.

817
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,683
- McPherson.
- Good morning, Mr. Pettigrew.

818
00:58:13,753 --> 00:58:18,952
Aye, it's a muckle big pile of letters
today, is it now? Something for you, Fraser.

819
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:22,226
Thank you.

820
00:58:23,329 --> 00:58:26,594
It's smelly.
Smells like Auntie Heloise.

821
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:30,101
Don't be ridiculous.

822
00:58:34,073 --> 00:58:36,303
<i>(Man) Morning, Master Fraser.</i>

823
00:58:42,148 --> 00:58:44,378
So, uh, what seems to be
the problem here?

824
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:47,214
- Ma'am. - It's right here.
- Thank you, Aggie.

825
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:51,312
- Oh.
- Are you cold, Mumsie?

826
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:54,723
Just a wee bit.
Always seem to be these days.

827
00:58:56,429 --> 00:59:00,798
I've run out of firelighters. You could
fetch some for me, Fraser, hmm?

828
00:59:00,866 --> 00:59:04,529
- Will you pay me?
- Pay you?

829
00:59:04,603 --> 00:59:07,629
Uh-huh. I want to save up
and buy something.

830
00:59:07,707 --> 00:59:10,904
- Look. Here it is. Number 32.
- (Laughs)

831
00:59:10,976 --> 00:59:13,843
Is this what you came up for?
I thought you missed me.

832
00:59:13,913 --> 00:59:17,076
- Hmm. My goodness.
- Just the right size for my room.

833
00:59:17,149 --> 00:59:20,380
That's a lot of firelighters.
You'd best get started, young man.

834
00:59:22,621 --> 00:59:25,089
(Chuckling)

835
00:59:25,157 --> 00:59:27,091
A penny a dozen.

836
00:59:50,649 --> 00:59:54,278
<i>(Heloise) ''Dear Edward, All I want</i>

<i>With best wishes''</i>

840
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,795
<i>(Andrew) Something's</i>
<i>troubling him. He's not himself.</i>

841
01:00:09,869 --> 01:00:11,928
What do you think it is,
Andrew?

842
01:00:12,004 --> 01:00:14,632
Oh, worries about the estate,
I expect--

843
01:00:14,707 --> 01:00:17,608
about your uncle Morris
and the changes he'll make,

844
01:00:17,676 --> 01:00:22,079
the future, the family-- all the things
a father worries about.

845
01:00:22,148 --> 01:00:24,548
Sometimes children worry
as well, though.

846
01:00:24,617 --> 01:00:27,586
And what do they
worry about, Fraser?

847
01:00:27,653 --> 01:00:30,383
Do you think there's
something evil about jazz?

848
01:00:30,456 --> 01:00:33,118
(Chuckling) Are we having
a debate here, Fraser?

849
01:00:33,192 --> 01:00:36,821
It's a Socratic dialogue, Andrew.
It's how you find out about the world,

850
01:00:36,896 --> 01:00:39,387
how it works.

851
01:00:39,465 --> 01:00:42,059
(Sighs) I'll tell ya how it works.

852
01:00:43,335 --> 01:00:46,133
In the heart of this world
there's a molten core,

853
01:00:46,205 --> 01:00:48,935
thousands of degrees Fahrenheit
of boiling magma.

854
01:00:49,008 --> 01:00:52,068
Do you know what magma is?

855
01:00:52,144 --> 01:00:54,408
Well, it's like lava, only thicker.

856
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,541
The fundus of the boiling heart
moves the continents around...

857
01:00:58,617 --> 01:01:00,812
on the surface of the Earth,

858
01:01:00,886 --> 01:01:03,912
and the continents crunch
into one another to make the mountains.

859
01:01:03,989 --> 01:01:06,890
I thought--
Didn't God make the mountains?

860
01:01:06,959 --> 01:01:08,893
- In the first place?
- Uh-huh.

861
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:12,226
Aye, well, there is
some argument about that.

862
01:01:12,298 --> 01:01:15,961
Have you carved out
your lantern yet, Fraser?

863
01:01:16,035 --> 01:01:19,300
- For Halloween? - Aye. Cassie
and Donald have done theirs.

864
01:01:21,674 --> 01:01:23,369
<i>(Muttering)</i>

865
01:01:23,442 --> 01:01:27,845

for the walk home... if you're good.

866
01:01:27,913 --> 01:01:29,972
<i>(Fraser narrating)</i>
<i>Halloween is a time of great evil...</i>

867
01:01:30,049 --> 01:01:32,779
<i>when terrible crimes</i>
<i>and atrocities happen,</i>

868
01:01:32,852 --> 01:01:36,015
<i>like, for instance,</i>
<i>a gay gordance.</i>

869
01:01:36,088 --> 01:01:39,387
We're going to start
with a gay gordance.

870
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:43,087
Now, since some of you probably
aren't familiar with a gay gordance,

871
01:01:43,162 --> 01:01:49,067
Fraser Pettigrew and Cassie Burns
will lead us through it all very slowly.

872
01:01:49,134 --> 01:01:51,568
- Fraser?
- Mumsie.

873
01:01:51,637 --> 01:01:53,571

- That's it. That's it!
- What?

- Fraser!
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

01:02:56,201 --> 01:02:58,931
He's touchin' my sister.
He was feelin' her ass.

891
01:02:59,004 --> 01:03:02,838
- He was feelin' my sister's ass and her
titties as well. - That's enough.

892
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:05,638
I wasn't touchin' anybody!
I was just doing the gay gordance.

893
01:03:05,711 --> 01:03:08,077

<i>Aye.</i>

<i>There we are.</i>

01:04:10,075 --> 01:04:14,876
<i>(Fraser) The</i> Encyclopedia says dancing

<i>(Mechanical whirring)</i>

914

<i>Then I fell asleep and dreamt</i>
<i>about Auntie Heloise.</i>

917
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:44,801
So, when you wake up after
one of these dreams, Fraser,

918
01:04:44,877 --> 01:04:47,641
- Uh-huh.
- (Blows nose) and the bed's wet,

919
01:04:47,713 --> 01:04:50,341
- Not hardly ever. - and it was a 
very nice dream that you were having--

920
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:52,714
- I hardly ever wet the bed anymore,
Father. - No, I know.

921
01:04:52,785 --> 01:04:55,276
- I haven't since I was very little--
- No, I know, I know, Fraser.

922
01:04:55,354 --> 01:04:57,948
But if, um--

923
01:04:58,023 --> 01:05:01,652
(Sighing) When, in the future,

924
01:05:01,727 --> 01:05:04,355
you feel something well up
from deep within you,

925
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:07,490
- from the core of your very being--
- Like magma?

926
01:05:07,566 --> 01:05:12,094
- Uh-- What's magma?
- It's--

927
01:05:12,171 --> 01:05:14,935
it's like lava, only thicker.

928
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:18,272
Well, probably.

929
01:05:18,343 --> 01:05:20,277
(Blows)

930
01:05:20,345 --> 01:05:24,611
- But when you've had a very nice
dream-- - I have nice dreams as well.

931
01:05:24,683 --> 01:05:27,846
- Precisely. - I dreamt about
Auntie Heloise playing jazz.

932
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,152
- It was the first dream I've ever
had that had music in it. - Dear God.

933
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:35,591
Well, next time you hear music in a dream, 
as soon as you've waken up in the morning...

934
01:05:35,661 --> 01:05:39,961
you must run down to the loch with me and
have a cold plunge-- <i>mens sana in corpore sano.</i>

935
01:05:40,032 --> 01:05:44,025
- ''Healthy mind in a healthy body''
- Healthy body. I know.

936
01:05:45,304 --> 01:05:48,171
Yeah. Well.

937
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,038
(Sighs) Well,
that's all cleared up then.

938
01:05:53,812 --> 01:05:59,250
So, uh, Fraser, is there anything
you'd like to ask me about?

939
01:05:59,318 --> 01:06:02,481
What's an... orgy, Father?

940
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:09,587
- Uh-huh.
- And, uh-- and a fellatio--

941
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:12,858
is it like a trombone
the angels blow into in heaven?

942
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:16,759
Uh--

943
01:06:16,835 --> 01:06:20,896
(Stammering)
They're both, I believe, Fraser,

944
01:06:20,973 --> 01:06:23,567
what we call temptations of the flesh.

945
01:06:23,642 --> 01:06:26,577
I know that,
but what <i>are</i> they?

946
01:06:26,645 --> 01:06:30,081
- What are <i>what</i>?
- Temptations of the flesh.

947
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:33,414
What are they?

948
01:06:33,485 --> 01:06:36,579
Well--
What are they?

949
01:06:38,357 --> 01:06:40,791
(Blows nose loudly)

950
01:06:40,859 --> 01:06:43,794
Uh, what are they?

951
01:06:43,862 --> 01:06:46,228
Well, they--
Well, I'll tell you what they are.

952
01:06:46,298 --> 01:06:48,698
They are to be resisted
at all costs.

953
01:06:52,037 --> 01:06:53,971
-<i>Gamma?</i>
- Hmm?

954
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:56,530
Did gods in ancient Greece
turn themselves into animals, really?

955
01:06:56,608 --> 01:06:59,133
Well, what do you mean
by ''really'', Fraser?

956
01:06:59,211 --> 01:07:04,808
- Did they actually do it?
- Well, sometimes they actually did it, in legend.

957
01:07:04,883 --> 01:07:09,149
Why didn't Jesus ever turn
himself into an animal, Gamma?

958
01:07:09,221 --> 01:07:12,713
Oh, turning oneself into an animal isn't
very Christian, Fraser.

959
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:15,191
I think if I was Jesus, though,

960
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:18,093
I would have liked
to turn myself into a swan, or a bull.

961
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:23,900
I think that is quite enough
about if you were Jesus, young man.

962
01:07:32,311 --> 01:07:35,974
I've always wanted to be
a polar bear.

963
01:07:36,048 --> 01:07:39,017
(Laughing)

964
01:07:40,185 --> 01:07:43,245
Get by the fire! Hello.
How are you?

965
01:07:43,322 --> 01:07:47,452
- Ooh, Marnie. Ooh, Marnie.
-<i>Fraser!</i>

966
01:07:49,228 --> 01:07:53,494
Mumsie, they're here!
Uncle Morris and Auntie Heloise.

967
01:07:53,565 --> 01:07:55,999
Fraser, my favorite nephew!
Come!

968
01:07:56,068 --> 01:08:01,028
- Give a kiss to your old Auntie Heloise!
- Mumsie! Mother!

969
01:08:01,106 --> 01:08:04,166
<i>Auntie Heloise</i>
<i>and Uncle Morris!</i>

970
01:08:04,243 --> 01:08:06,643
<i>They've arrived</i>
<i>for the bonspiel!</i>

971
01:08:13,952 --> 01:08:15,886
- Heloise.
- Yes?

972
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:21,653
- Happy?
- Yes, very.

973
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:23,661
I hope <i>you</i> are.

974
01:08:31,403 --> 01:08:35,305
Those... are the Ailsa Craigs,
Fraser.

975
01:08:35,374 --> 01:08:40,004
(Chuckling) Your grandfather's
favorite stones.

976
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:44,742
Aye, I used to polish them
personally for him.

977
01:08:44,816 --> 01:08:48,274
They're the best ones--
real beauties.

978
01:08:48,353 --> 01:08:51,550
Why are they the best, Tom?

979
01:08:51,623 --> 01:08:56,060
A very dense granite,
and a very fine grain.

980
01:08:56,128 --> 01:08:59,620
That means the stone
has massive momentum,

981
01:08:59,698 --> 01:09:02,326
if you've the muscle on ya
to get them movin'.

982
01:09:02,401 --> 01:09:06,963
(Chuckles)
Here, look at this.

983
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:09,530
Plutonic igneous granite.

984
01:09:09,608 --> 01:09:12,406
What does ''plutonic'' mean?

985
01:09:12,477 --> 01:09:18,245
Pluto was the god of darkness,
a black prince of Hades.

986
01:09:18,317 --> 01:09:21,411
These stones are from magma,
Fraser,

987
01:09:21,486 --> 01:09:25,946
forged in the very bowels
of hell--

988
01:09:26,024 --> 01:09:30,723
- speaking geologically, of course.
- Wow!

989
01:09:34,499 --> 01:09:37,525
<i>(Fraser) The bonspiel is when all</i>
<i>the curling teams from all around...</i>

990
01:09:37,602 --> 01:09:40,435
<i>play in a huge contest.</i>

991
01:09:40,505 --> 01:09:43,497
Young Jim--
Young Jim, Big Jim.

992
01:09:43,575 --> 01:09:45,975
(Chattering)

993
01:09:46,044 --> 01:09:49,980
I want a side bet for the miners.
I'll have ten guineas on this one.

994
01:09:50,048 --> 01:09:52,073
-<i>Ten guineas on you, boy.</i>
- (Bell ringing)

995
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:56,086
Ladies and gentlemen,

996
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:59,146
today, for the first time ever,

997
01:09:59,224 --> 01:10:03,820
we are competing
for the Macintosh Challenge trophy.

998
01:10:03,895 --> 01:10:06,420
<i>(Gamma) Curling was</i>
<i>my Samuel's passion</i>--

999
01:10:06,498 --> 01:10:08,989
a game that could be shared
by all.

1000
01:10:09,067 --> 01:10:14,130
I dedicate this bonspiel
to my dear departed husband,

1001
01:10:14,206 --> 01:10:16,868
Samuel Macintosh.

1002
01:10:16,942 --> 01:10:20,901
On my signal,
let the roaring game begin!

1003
01:10:22,914 --> 01:10:25,508
(Cheering, bagpipes playing)

1004
01:10:27,552 --> 01:10:30,146
(Shouting)

1005
01:10:35,394 --> 01:10:37,589
- (Shouting, indistinct )
-<i>Sweep! Sweep!</i>

1006
01:10:37,662 --> 01:10:41,758
<i>Luck of the devil.</i>
<i>Well done, though, sweeps!</i>

1007
01:10:45,237 --> 01:10:48,695
The best noise in all the world.
As good as jazz.

1008
01:10:49,775 --> 01:10:52,710
<i>§§§§(Bagpipes playing)</i>

1009
01:10:57,315 --> 01:11:00,614
- Are you winning, Uncle Crawford?
- No. In a word, Fraser,

1010
01:11:00,685 --> 01:11:02,619
we're getting thrashed.

1011
01:11:02,687 --> 01:11:05,053
Angie's team is just
limbering up against us, Fraser.

1012
01:11:05,123 --> 01:11:08,217
- I fancy they'll be lifting the cup at the
end of the day. - (Scoffs) Not a chance.

1013
01:11:08,293 --> 01:11:11,956
- These miner boys are unstoppable.
- Nonsense. You want to bet?

1014
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:14,692
Edward, I'm a millionaire.
What are you going to bet me?

1015
01:11:14,766 --> 01:11:18,725
- And what is that supposed to mean?
- It means what do you have...

1016
01:11:18,804 --> 01:11:22,433
that I might want
to take from you in a bet?

1017
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:27,841
What do I have, Morris?
What do I have?

1018
01:11:27,913 --> 01:11:31,110
- This.
- Sorry? What?

1019
01:11:31,183 --> 01:11:33,549
This, this-this place,
this estate.

1020
01:11:33,618 --> 01:11:37,315
Kiloran, the moss factory.
What I have?

1021
01:11:37,389 --> 01:11:40,187
I'll bet you everything Andrew's
team'll take the bonspiel.

1022
01:11:40,258 --> 01:11:42,351
- Everything.
- All right, Skip!

1023
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:47,364
What makes you think
it's yours to bet, Edward?

1024
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:50,833
Sweep! Sweep!

1025
01:11:54,272 --> 01:11:57,867
- And what about you, hmm?
- How do you mean?

1026
01:11:57,943 --> 01:12:00,844
Well, what would you put up
in return? Eh, Morris?

1027
01:12:00,912 --> 01:12:05,042
What's the millionaire got
that he couldn't bear to lose?

1028
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:07,710
What means more than anything?
All his money?

1029
01:12:07,786 --> 01:12:10,755
<i>Business? His two homes?</i>

1030
01:12:10,822 --> 01:12:13,882
What means more to you
than anything else?

1031
01:12:16,294 --> 01:12:19,263
I suppose you're referring
to my wife, hmm?

1032
01:12:19,331 --> 01:12:22,926
And what makes you think
she's yours to bet, Morris?

1033
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:25,868
<i>(Curling stone hitting ice)</i>

1034
01:12:30,275 --> 01:12:32,743
- Crack down, Jim Menries!
- (Fraser) Crack down, Jim Menries!

1035
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:37,646
<i>Crack down!</i>
<i>Crack down, Jim Menries!</i>

1036

1037
01:12:42,287 --> 01:12:44,221
Aaah!

1038
01:12:46,858 --> 01:12:49,053
(All laughing)

1039
01:12:52,564 --> 01:12:55,397
What the hell was that?

1040
01:12:55,467 --> 01:12:58,800
Stone's cracked, Andrew, son.
Handle's loose. The stone's rubbish, I'm afraid.

1041
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:01,236
I'll get the stone, Andrew.

1042
01:13:05,277 --> 01:13:07,973
Oh, come on, Andrew. Hey! And--

1043
01:13:08,046 --> 01:13:10,981
(Airplane engine rumbling)

1044
01:13:13,652 --> 01:13:15,586
The emperor.

1045
01:13:24,663 --> 01:13:27,598
The emperor of the air!
The emperor's coming!

1046
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:30,032
Mumsie, Mr. Chenoux's coming!

1047

(Shouting, laughing)

1050
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:54,719
Mr. Chenoux, can I have a ride
in your airplane, please?

1051
01:13:54,793 --> 01:13:59,162
<i>No, no, no, Fraser. You're a wee bit
too young. Mr. Chenoux, meet Heloise.</i>

1052
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:02,324
- Heloise, this is Mr. Chenoux.
- (Both speaking French)

1053
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,460
- She's French, and, uh--
- Morris Macintosh.

1054
01:14:05,537 --> 01:14:08,665
- I'd like to present my mother.

<i>She moves with a remarkable elegance,</i>
<i>don't you think, Fraser?</i>

1061
01:14:33,465 --> 01:14:36,866

- No, not your auntie-- your sister, Elspeth.

1063
01:14:39,237 --> 01:14:41,102

- Elspeth?
- Yeah.

- Whaa!
- Who-Whoa!

1066
01:14:46,244 --> 01:14:48,371
<i>(Fraser) I think the emperor</i>
<i>wants to dance with Elspeth...</i>

1067
01:14:48,446 --> 01:14:50,607
<i>because all that's on his mind</i>
<i>is slanking.</i>

- <i>He's French.</i>

1069

- Gamma, please.
- What's the matter now, Fraser?

1072
01:15:12,671 --> 01:15:17,199
Can Jim Menries play with Grandfather's
stones if we make it to the final?

1073
01:15:17,275 --> 01:15:20,574
- <i>The Ailsa Craigs</i>--
<i>can Jim and Andrew have</i>--
- No, I don't think so, Fraser.

1074
01:15:20,645 --> 01:15:23,079
- That's not appropriate.
- But Uncle Morris,

1075
01:15:23,148 --> 01:15:25,241
Gamma says it's a game
that can be shared by everyone.

1076
01:15:25,316 --> 01:15:28,615
<i>Yes, well, never mind</i>
<i>about that, Fraser. I said no.</i>

1077

Now, go on, run along.
Eat your stew.

1078
01:15:30,689 --> 01:15:32,623

Dear Moira,

Jesus came for Gamma.

1102
01:17:48,393 --> 01:17:51,590
<i>(Fraser) In her will, Gamma decided</i>
<i>to give the estate to us,</i>

<i>And if only Uncle Crawford</i>

- Did not what, Fraser?

Jesus!
That's a wicked fib!

<i>You're making her feel worse!</i>

01:18:11,683 --> 01:18:14,811
Fraser, that's quite enough.
Speak to a grown-up like that.

1111
01:18:14,886 --> 01:18:17,650
- i>Edward, the child is upset.</i>
<i>He's only trying</i>-- - I'll thank you...

1112
01:18:17,722 --> 01:18:20,987
- not to interfere, Heloise.
- Don't listen to your father, Fraser.

1113
01:18:21,059 --> 01:18:24,995
Leave the bloody child alone
when I'm talking to him, woman.

1114
01:18:25,063 --> 01:18:27,327
- Don't you <i>dare</i> use that
tone of voice with my wife! -<i>Enough!</i>

1115
01:18:27,398 --> 01:18:31,562
This is my home and I'll be
damned if I'll let you throw
your weight around any longer!

1116
01:18:40,245 --> 01:18:42,770
I think we should leave now.

1117
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:49,417
My mother never saw through you,
Pettigrew. I do though.

1118
01:18:49,487 --> 01:18:52,820
You're a shabby little Lothario.
You're a--

1119
01:18:52,891 --> 01:18:54,825
(Chuckles) You're a joke!

1120
01:18:54,893 --> 01:18:57,521
You're not fit to run
my mother's estate!

1121
01:18:57,595 --> 01:19:00,723
<i>My</i> estate, Morris<i>. My</i> estate.

1122
01:19:00,798 --> 01:19:02,732
(Laughs)

1123
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,133
Is this really what you want, Morris,
more than anything?

1124
01:19:06,204 --> 01:19:09,196
Hmm? Except, you see,
I've already won it!

1125
01:19:11,376 --> 01:19:13,435
I'm not talking about
the estate either, Morris.

1126
01:19:13,511 --> 01:19:16,503
<i>I won the bet months ago.</i>

1127
01:19:21,953 --> 01:19:24,945

-<i>(Dog Barking)</i>

1129
01:19:28,559 --> 01:19:31,357
-<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>
- Morris--

1130
01:19:58,456 --> 01:20:01,323
It was a silly bet.

1131
01:20:06,531 --> 01:20:08,761
Do you think I don't know...

1132
01:20:10,301 --> 01:20:12,235
about you and her?

1133
01:20:14,672 --> 01:20:17,197
I suppose you've had
your hands on her.

1134
01:20:20,111 --> 01:20:23,512
<i>Do you think I'm blind?</i>
<i>That I am a fool?</i>

1135
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:27,017
Do you think I don't know
that you want her--

1136
01:20:27,085 --> 01:20:30,919
her instead of me? (Sobs)

1137
01:20:30,989 --> 01:20:33,287
<i>Instead of us?</i>

1138
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:28,244
Edward, please--

1139
01:21:30,014 --> 01:21:32,175
Edward, you must listen to me.

1140
01:21:54,338 --> 01:21:56,772
Understand me, Edward.

1141
01:21:56,841 --> 01:21:58,775
This is our home.

1142
01:22:01,045 --> 01:22:03,536
<i>Morris is gone.</i>

1143
01:22:07,251 --> 01:22:10,015
I only want you.

1144
01:22:11,289 --> 01:22:14,156
You must work out
what it is <i>you</i> want.

1145
01:23:35,373 --> 01:23:38,900
I didn't mean to cause
all that trouble.

1146
01:23:38,976 --> 01:23:41,137
- I know you didn't.
- Elspeth,

1147
01:23:41,212 --> 01:23:44,579
is Dad gonna stay
with Mumsie and the rest of us?

1148
01:23:44,649 --> 01:23:48,483
- I don't know, Fraser.
- What did Mumsie mean when she said...

1149
01:23:48,553 --> 01:23:52,284
Dad's had his hands
on Auntie Heloise?

1150
01:23:52,356 --> 01:23:55,382
Had carnal knowledge of her,
like in the Bible.

1151
01:23:55,459 --> 01:23:57,586
Isn't that a dreadful sin?

1152
01:23:59,263 --> 01:24:01,493
I don't know. Is it?

1153
01:24:01,566 --> 01:24:04,296
Elspeth, is it like a slank?

1154
01:24:04,368 --> 01:24:08,304
No. That's something you do
with somebody you love.

1155
01:24:08,372 --> 01:24:11,102
Did you do it
with the emperor of the air?

1156
01:24:11,175 --> 01:24:13,803
That's not
any of your business, Fraser.

1157
01:24:17,415 --> 01:24:21,476
Heloise got it for you.
She brought it from Paris.

1158
01:24:21,552 --> 01:24:24,112
She thought it was something
you might enjoy.

1159
01:24:28,693 --> 01:24:31,423
- Louis Armstrong!

1160
01:25:43,401 --> 01:25:45,335
I've been a child.

1161
01:25:46,537 --> 01:25:48,471
It wasn't just Morris.

1162
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:58,314
I'm so sorry.

1163
01:26:27,345 --> 01:26:30,576
<i>(Fraser narrating) The next few months</i>
<i>weren't easy for any of us,</i>

1164
01:26:30,648 --> 01:26:34,880
<i>but Dad worked hard,</i>
<i>and Mumsie finally forgave him.</i>

1165
01:26:34,952 --> 01:26:39,753
<i>And bit by bit, Dad remembered</i>
<i>the knack of making Mumsie laugh.</i>

1166

<i>(Thunderclap)</i>

1167
01:27:07,084 --> 01:27:09,143
<i>He asked me again last night</i>--

1168
01:27:11,622 --> 01:27:14,921
adultery, sins of the flesh,
sins of the heart--

01:27:25,569 --> 01:27:28,663
- I'll go and fetch him.
- Quick, or we'll miss the service.

1172
01:27:31,375 --> 01:27:33,366

- To look for Fraser.
