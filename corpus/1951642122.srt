1
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,831
The guy's been shot, Jesse.

2
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,536
-You found him?
-Yeah.

3
00:03:57,668 --> 00:04:00,076
I'm on the 11:00 to 7:00.

4
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:03,416
I pulled over to take a leak and saw the dog.

5
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:09,090
Don't know him.

6
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:11,926
His wallet and licence are still in his pocket.

7
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:13,303
Kenneth Eisley.

8
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:16,427
Big house on the other side of the water.

9
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:19,018
Another commuter who moved here
looking for paradise.

10
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:20,726
Well, he found it.

11
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:24,396
Looks like . 22s.

12
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,688
lt's a murder, isn't it, Jesse?

13
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:30,029
Probably.

14
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:34,324
Do you think the tide washed him up here?

15
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:39,741
A body that's been in the ocean and
washed up on shore doesn't look like that.

16
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:41,585
-More beat-up.
-Yep.

17
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:45,630
-He's got some marks on his face.
-That would be the gulls.

18
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:48,881
I could have lived without knowing that.

19
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:51,586
-What about shell casings?
-No.

20
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:55,266
-Maybe the killer picked them up.
-Or used a revolver.

21
00:04:57,603 --> 00:05:00,177
Anthony said on the phone
we got a murder?

22
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:04,394
You're the crime scene guy, Doc,
but there's two bullet holes in his chest.

23
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:06,187
That'll be a clue.

24
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:11,072
-He's not in rigor yet.
-What does that mean?

25
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,608
He ran into his killer
less than two hours ago.

26
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:15,025
Or killers.

27
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:17,698
D'Angelo, close the area.

28
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,828
lt's November, Skipper.
Nobody uses it anyway.

29
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:22,998
This guy did.

30
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:28,460
What about the dog? He's just sitting there.

31
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:20,225
Jesse, it's Jenn.

32
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:22,848
Are you there?

33
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,854
lt's late.
Guess you're asleep or out on a date.

34
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:33,612
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sound like that.
I've had a long day.

35
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,983
I was pointing to Teaneck, New Jersey...

36
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:38,823
when I was giving the forecast
for Long lsland.

37
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:43,792
Actually, it didn't matter.
Weather girls aren't taken seriously, anyway.

38
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:46,375
Then I was out all night until now...

39
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:49,873
and the network had this fundraising thing
over at the Met...

40
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:52,712
and Craig, my segment producer, took me.

41
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,252
Anyway, I'm beat. I'm gonna crash.

42
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:57,547
I guess I'll talk to you....

43
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,343
...seriously, anyway.

44
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:02,761
Then I was out all night until now...

45
00:07:02,895 --> 00:07:06,311
and the network had this fundraising thing
over at the Met...

46
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,228
and Craig, my segment producer, took me.

47
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,732
Anyway, I'm beat. I'm gonna crash.

48
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,985
I guess I'll talk to you tomorrow.

49
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:27,909
Hey.

50
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:32,417
lt's 7:00 in the morning.
What are you doing here?

51
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,673
I'm up early, fighting crime.

52
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:38,506
-Can you come over tonight?
-I'd be foolish not to.

53
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,762
-We can order in.
-Chinese?

54
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:43,430
Because you know how erotic I get
when I eat Chinese.

55
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:45,221
Or when you don't.

56
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,155
Age: 37. Divorced, no children.

57
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:58,448
His parents live in Amherst.
They've been notified.

58
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:01,948
Somebody killed him
and they had to have a reason.

59
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,574
Talk with the people he worked with.

60
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:06,624
Perkins said he'd get to Eisley's autopsy
around lunchtime, Skipper.

61
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:08,708
D'Angelo, in all the years I've been a cop...

62
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:12,003
I have never heard the police chief
referred to as "Skipper. "

63
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:15,215
Chief, there's a couple here
with their daughter. The Penningtons.

64
00:08:15,343 --> 00:08:17,668
-What do they want?
-They didn't want to say...

65
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:20,129
but I think you need to talk with them.

66
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:24,507
Call Capt. Healey. Tell him we're sending
the bullets down for ballistics.

67
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:25,806
Right.

68
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:29,351
Good morning, folks. I'm Chief Stone.

69
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:31,816
Please sit down.

70
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,065
-My daughter has been raped.
-Mother!

71
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:42,692
Molly, you might want to stick around.

72
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:46,242
-l didn't get raped.
-Please, honey.

73
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,868
She came home late last night.
She tried to slip into the house.

74
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:54,835
Her jeans were ripped, her hair was a mess,
her lip was bleeding.

75
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,504
I insisted on inspecting her myself.

76
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:01,380
She had on no underwear
and her thighs were bruised.

77
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,763
Did you take her to the doctor?

78
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:06,801
And have it all over town? God, no.

79
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,225
I cleaned her up
and brought her straight to you.

80
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:11,395
Cleaned her up? How?

81
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:16,851
I put her in a hot bath and scrubbed her
myself, like she was 2 years old.

82
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:19,027
Who did this to you, Candace?

83
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:22,360
-l don't want to talk about it.
-You tell them, young lady.

84
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:27,036
Candace, if we don't know who did it,
it might happen again...

85
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:30,038
to somebody else or to you.

86
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:35,086
-Tell the Chief what happened right now.
-No hitting.

87
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:39,626
Molly, take Candace outside.

88
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:44,971
Come with me, Candace.

89
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,229
lsn't there some kind of a test?

90
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:57,562
A hot bath tends to wash away
that kind of evidence...

91
00:09:57,695 --> 00:10:01,146
-but the hospital might be able to tell us--
-No, I won't take her.

92
00:10:01,282 --> 00:10:02,480
Margaret.

93
00:10:05,244 --> 00:10:08,530
This incident must remain confidential.
Can you promise me that?

94
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:09,862
Of course not.

95
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:14,335
We don't plan to blab about it.
But if there's a trial, people will find out.

96
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:16,545
We can't discuss this any further.

97
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:19,377
I want my daughter,
and we're going home now.

98
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:27,389
I've said what I have to say.

99
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:31,466
-Mrs. Pennington, why don't you let us--
-l have nothing to say to you.

100
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,516
Anything you want to tell me?

101
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,451
Poor kid. What are we gonna do?

102
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:57,207
You heard her mother.
She doesn't want a scandal.

103
00:10:57,338 --> 00:10:59,247
So we're not gonna do anything?

104
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:02,667
I didn't say that.
Why don't you go down to the high school?

105
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:05,044
-And do what?
-Keep an eye on her.

106
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:07,504
-Find out who did this.
-How?

107
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:10,301
You'll think of something.

108
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:44,966
-Am I late?
-No.

109
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:47,461
You can't invite someone over for dinner...

110
00:11:47,597 --> 00:11:49,673
and just plunk down cartons of food
on the table.

111
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,512
Of course you can't.
I just wanted to see if you knew that.

112
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:53,924
Yeah, right.

113
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,526
-There's a dog in here.
-Yeah.

114
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:53,703
Where are you going?

115
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,374
Do you want water?

116
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:01,582
Wine.

117
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:30,982
The floor's gotten cold.

118
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:33,575
The season's over.

119
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:43,455
I'm worried.

120
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,463
Someone will find him.

121
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,965
I just couldn't kill a dog.

122
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:53,970
Let it go. Let's go, Reggie.

123
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:57,553
Go, boy. Ready?

124
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:01,437
-You ever met him?
-Who?

125
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:05,768
-The baseball player on your wall.
-Ozzie? No.

126
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:09,197
But he was the best shortstop I ever saw.

127
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:11,860
Would you have been that good
if you hadn't been hurt?

128
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:15,407
I might have made the show,
but I wouldn't have been Ozzie.

129
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:18,448
Do you miss it?

130
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:21,655
Every day.

131
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:28,205
Why do you think we get along?

132
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:30,467
I don't know.

133
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:34,047
We're an odd pair. I'm way too old for you.

134
00:14:35,014 --> 00:14:37,386
So why do you think we get along?

135
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:42,469
-Because we're pals.
-Pals that have sex.

136
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,775
You're like me.

137
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,855
You won't commit to a relationship
just to have it.

138
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:53,357
Neither one of us requires a commitment
from the other.

139
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:56,575
Which produces a kind of commitment
to each other.

140
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:01,201
I don't mean this in any negative way...

141
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:04,286
but you may be the simplest person
I've ever met.

142
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:09,588
You know what you know, you do
what you do, and you just keep doing it.

143
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:13,337
-Like a mule.
-Or a jackass.

144
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:21,180
One shot, straight through the heart.

145
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,184
The other clipped the descending aorta.

146
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:25,971
You want all the details
about what got penetrated?

147
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:27,649
I'll read the report.

148
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,288
Looks like 40 grain, standard velocity,
$10-a-brick ammunition.

149
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:43,038
Almost like a pro.

150
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:46,119
Shots entered the body
about 30 degrees apart.

151
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:47,876
What's that mean to you?

152
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:50,673
I don't know, Jess.
I'm a paediatrician most of the time.

153
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:53,206
This is the first murder I've seen.

154
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:56,219
You must have seen
lots of stuff like this in LA.

155
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:59,964
lt could mean that the victim moved
after the first shot hit him.

156
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:02,056
Or one shooter with two guns.

157
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:05,351
Or two shots at the same time
from two shooters.

158
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:08,523
We should pull
all the city and state firearm records.

159
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:10,938
Good luck.
Everyone in the state owns a . 22.

160
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:13,738
We could cross-reference
for people who live in and around--

161
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:17,148
lf it was bought in Massachusetts,
if the gun store did its paperwork...

162
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:21,067
if we didn't lose it in the computer,
and if they live in Paradise.

163
00:16:21,787 --> 00:16:23,531
We've got him cornered.

164
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,911
-What, so we shouldn't?
-No, go ahead. We have to.

165
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:32,955
But smart criminals
don't use registered guns to commit murder.

166
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,008
-You think he's smart?
-He or she.

167
00:16:56,322 --> 00:16:57,982
Hey, Pennington.

168
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:00,867
What? No hello?

169
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:05,952
You see these? Don't you say a thing.

170
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:10,075
Actually, that's my favourite.

171
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:22,593
You say anything and you're dead.

172
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:39,443
Listen, I'll have to call you back.

173
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:42,658
Does that translate to, "I've lD'd the rapist"?

174
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:46,239
-There's a dog in here.
-Witness protection.

175
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,826
Bo Marino.

176
00:17:51,627 --> 00:17:55,210
-The football player.
-Football star and two of his teammates.

177
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:58,376
Bo showed something to Candace
that scared the hell out of her.

178
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:02,839
-You know who the boys were with Marino?
-Kevin Feeney and Troy Drake.

179
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:05,881
-You got anything else?
-Not yet.

180
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,511
You got a plan?

181
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:10,388
I'm going to haunt them.

182
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:13,475
-You have to work here some time.
-My time.

183
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:17,815
-lt's company time, too. Company business.
-lt's women's business.

184
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,821
Men may know things women don't.

185
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:23,819
Yes, but rape is one of the things we know.

186
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:26,653
So I'm going to haunt them.

187
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:40,418
Don't lean so close....

188
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:43,553
Higher!

189
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:56,145
-Are you done with your paper?
-Yeah, you can have it.

190
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:58,731
-Thanks so much.
-Yeah, just keep it.

191
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:06,660
-See something you like?
-Yes. Take a look at this.

192
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:19,797
-l didn't know you were shooting this.
-I'm always shooting.

193
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:22,497
But ljust wanted to read it.

194
00:19:22,635 --> 00:19:24,213
She's the one.

195
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:26,423
She was nice.

196
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:29,757
She wanted to borrow my paper.

197
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:34,600
-You think she's good-looking?
-l think she's great-looking.

198
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:36,813
-Well, see you later.
-Thanks.

199
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,602
She looks kind of horsy to me.

200
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:48,034
She's the one.

201
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:52,661
How does it make you feel
that she's sleeping with other men?

202
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,455
-She has every right.
-But how does it make you feel?

203
00:19:58,838 --> 00:20:01,755
lt makes me want to kill
every man she's with.

204
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:03,752
But you don't.

205
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:05,676
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

206
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:11,051
You know that I'm a wiser person than you.

207
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:15,228
Which gives you the right
to offer me advice.

208
00:20:15,354 --> 00:20:17,181
Yes. lt's a rule.

209
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:23,984
Jesse, you've been divorced now for what,
five years?

210
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:28,148
-And you advise me to forget about Jenn?
-l do.

211
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,151
-ls anyone advising you otherwise?
-No.

212
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:36,113
lf you could resolve this thing with Jenn...

213
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,500
then maybe you could put
this drinking thing behind you, too...

214
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:43,080
and just be a really good police chief.

215
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:46,799
I've never been drunk on the job.

216
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:49,466
You have never been drunk on the job here.

217
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:53,141
Good point.

218
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,143
-So?
-So?

219
00:20:59,815 --> 00:21:01,725
Are you suggesting that I shut up?

220
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:04,860
No. Your advice is good.

221
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,488
lt's just not good for me.

222
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:33,923
Nobody's touched the body.

223
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:40,689
Who was she?

224
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:43,680
Her driver's licence says Barbara Carey.

225
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:53,365
Notice she got shot, just like the last guy.

226
00:21:53,494 --> 00:21:56,199
-Yeah, I noticed.
-Thought I'd mention it.

227
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,701
D'Angelo, I want pictures of all the cars
in the parking lot...

228
00:22:01,836 --> 00:22:03,828
licence plates so we can read them.

229
00:22:03,963 --> 00:22:05,208
-All of them?
-Yeah.

230
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:07,379
Who's going to pay for the film?

231
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:10,089
I will.

232
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,514
-You think the killer's still here?
-Would you be?

233
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:21,396
You okay?

234
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:25,769
He's interesting.

235
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:28,736
I didn't notice.

236
00:22:30,323 --> 00:22:32,066
They're taking down licence plates.

237
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,192
-They'll find our names.
-So?

238
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:36,948
They'll find a lot of other names, too.

239
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,081
You think they'll bring us in
for questioning?

240
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,124
Small-town force.

241
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,999
I don't think they've got the manpower.

242
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:48,505
lt might be kind of exciting if they did.

243
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:03,932
-You need a ride?
-What do you want?

244
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:05,436
To talk.

245
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:26,168
lf you want to slump down so nobody
sees you, I won't take it personally.

246
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:31,967
There's a dog here.

247
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:35,255
What's his name?

248
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:39,839
-What do you think his name is?
-Reggie?

249
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:43,808
You think he looks like a Reggie?

250
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:46,181
lt's what it says on his collar.

251
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:26,305
Bo Marino, Kevin Feeney, and Troy Drake.

252
00:24:28,524 --> 00:24:30,600
We both know they raped you.

253
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:34,523
And we both know they threatened you
about telling.

254
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:40,199
-How do you know?
-I'm the police chief. I know everything.

255
00:24:44,457 --> 00:24:45,785
lf you let them...

256
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:50,246
they will make your life miserable
for as long as you live in this town.

257
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:54,421
lf you tell me about it,
I can give you your life back.

258
00:24:56,928 --> 00:25:00,178
-My mother is....
-l can help you with your mother.

259
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:07,018
I want you to call me...

260
00:25:07,563 --> 00:25:10,730
any time, about anything.

261
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:15,609
This will be just between you and me...

262
00:25:15,738 --> 00:25:18,276
until you say otherwise. lt's our secret.

263
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:22,827
What are you going to do?

264
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,745
I'm going to haunt them.

265
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:29,789
-You won't tell?
-No.

266
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:41,670
But we're in this together, okay?

267
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:46,887
Okay.

268
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:14,290
-How come you're not in uniform?
-Casual Tuesday.

269
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:17,173
-Skip Wilder, Boston Herald.
-No comment.

270
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,848
You came all the way up from Boston
to pick up two bullets?

271
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,098
I came to see
if I could be of some assistance.

272
00:26:32,273 --> 00:26:33,518
I didn't bring him.

273
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:36,983
Find out if he drives a black BMW.
One was following me around.

274
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:40,069
Did you get the licence number, Skipper?

275
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:51,493
-You heard?
-I heard.

276
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:53,660
-Same m. o. ?
-Same m. o.

277
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,622
No obvious motive?

278
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:58,248
I think it might be random.

279
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,015
I'm the State Homicide Commander.
I'm not God.

280
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:10,890
-l thought they were the same thing.
-Think how disappointed I am.

281
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:13,347
lt could be a long process.

282
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:17,525
The sooner we confirm it, the sooner
we'll have the national media on us.

283
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,443
The process just got longer.

284
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:23,194
Thanks.

285
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:25,654
Suit?

286
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:31,000
Write me up a paper for the local paper
about how we have this all under control?

287
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,907
-Me?
-Yeah, you're good at that.

288
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:35,913
-l am?
-Yeah.

289
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,748
-Do we?
-What?

290
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,754
Have it all under control.

291
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:44,295
-Your wife's on Line 3.
-Ex-wife.

292
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:48,046
Call me.

293
00:27:54,981 --> 00:27:56,179
Hi.

294
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,477
-How are you doing up there?
-You heard.

295
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:01,355
I heard.

296
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:04,104
How about I drive up tomorrow?

297
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:07,738
This isnt a very good time, Jenn.

298
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:10,538
-I want to see you.
-Me, too

299
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:14,578
-I'm very disappointed.
-l know.

300
00:28:21,674 --> 00:28:25,672
-Working too hard, Jesse.
-l know.

301
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:31,929
What about therm?

302
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:34,764
ls there any reason to think
the killings are related?

303
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:36,141
We have two killings.

304
00:28:36,272 --> 00:28:40,104
We're not sure whether it's the same weapon
or weapons.  Thank you.

305
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,038
Larry, Curly, and Moe want to talk with you.

306
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:58,125
On behalf of the Town Council...

307
00:28:58,252 --> 00:29:02,297
Jim, Carter and I thought we ought to
get brought up tp speed on things.

308
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,087
So, what's really going on?

309
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,641
-That's all you know?
-Correct.

310
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,140
Correct.

311
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:26,278
-Hell.
-I told you he wasn't a talker.

312
00:29:26,697 --> 00:29:29,864
-So what do we tell the press?
-l like "no comment. "

313
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:36,123
Over at the hight school?

314
00:29:36,123 --> 00:29:39,623
Maybe you could allocate your personnel
a little better.

315
00:29:41,796 --> 00:29:43,456
Damn it, don't you talk?

316
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,046
Only when I have something to say.

317
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:50,173
Couldn't we get this thing resolved quicker
with FBl or State help?

318
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,013
The FBl and State Police
bring the national media.

319
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:57,261
You won't like this town
when they're through with it.

320
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:06,273
I'm a cop. I've been a cop for a long time.
I'm good at it.

321
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:10,653
-l know how to do this. You don't.
-Damn it, we can fire you.

322
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,828
You can. But you can't tell me what to do.

323
00:30:32,889 --> 00:30:34,881
You know that I'm wiser than you.

324
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:38,219
Is this friendly advice,
or are you speaking as the town lawyer?

325
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,060
I'm speaking as your pal.

326
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,229
You want to come over tonight
and make dinner?

327
00:30:44,358 --> 00:30:46,896
Don't change the subject,
and don't piss them off.

328
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:51,939
-No bones.
-That sounds good.

329
00:30:54,994 --> 00:30:57,200
-You know what sounds even better?
-What?

330
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,785
Don't piss off the Town Council, Jesse.

331
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,582
So, shall we say 7?

332
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:07,120
I know.

333
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,670
-What do you think?
-She's too young for him.

334
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:16,055
She's about your age.

335
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:18,758
Well, I'm more worldly.

336
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:44,750
Does the killer scare you?

337
00:31:45,628 --> 00:31:48,380
Don't shrug. I want you to answer.

338
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,295
I suppose I'd be an idiot not to be scared.

339
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:56,252
-Would you shoot him?
-lf I had to.

340
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,642
-Have you ever shot anyone before?
-Yes.

341
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:04,555
Did you kill them?

342
00:32:05,982 --> 00:32:07,061
Yes.

343
00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:11,808
-Do you want to tell me about it?
-No.

344
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,733
So you shot him dead?

345
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:23,329
-Did you mean to?
-Yes.

346
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,745
You didn't try to wound him,
shoot him in the leg or something?

347
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,289
He had a machete.

348
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,926
lt feels like you can't catch your breath,
there's a guy with a machete...

349
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:41,590
you aim centre of mass
and try not to jerk the trigger.

350
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:49,935
You've got about half a second
to figure out what needs to be done.

351
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:57,732
I guess you need to be that way
if you're a policeman.

352
00:32:57,867 --> 00:33:00,784
Maybe I'm a policeman
because I am that way.

353
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:15,712
Do you think the killings are connected?

354
00:33:17,345 --> 00:33:20,844
-Don't shrug. Do you have a guess?
-l try not to.

355
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,472
Sure, but you're not just a cop.

356
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,726
You are, after all, also a person.

357
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:31,307
I'm better at being a cop,
and it's best if cops don't hope.

358
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,277
I'm not so sure you're a
better cop than a person.

359
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,526
I know. Thank you.

360
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,181
He was shot up here. He must have fallen.

361
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,684
-Family?
-Wife, three daughters.

362
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:16,777
I'll talk to them.

363
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,895
And they won't have any idea
why someone killed him.

364
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,567
I'll ask if they know Kenneth Eisley
and Barbara Carey...

365
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:28,241
and they won't. And we'll find
no connection between the three of them.

366
00:34:33,546 --> 00:34:35,953
lt's the same, only different.

367
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,799
We've got a witness.

368
00:34:39,802 --> 00:34:42,554
-l want to talk to him.
-Okay.

369
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:51,268
Philly, this is Chief Stone.
Tell him what you told me.

370
00:34:53,232 --> 00:34:54,643
Sure.

371
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:59,813
The streets need paving.
With unpaved streets, it's very dangerous.

372
00:35:00,406 --> 00:35:03,193
Water in the streets,
the street's full of holes.

373
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,989
Now, Philly, you told me you saw some cars.

374
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:11,409
Police cars, too.

375
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,997
Well, there was one car. A red Explorer.

376
00:35:23,971 --> 00:35:25,430
You sure about that?

377
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:17,349
Hold it there a minute, Bo.

378
00:36:17,984 --> 00:36:19,608
You can't come in here.

379
00:36:19,735 --> 00:36:22,405
-You're using a controlled substance.
-A what?

380
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:30,235
-This is a men's room.
-I'd like you to come down to the station.

381
00:36:36,836 --> 00:36:38,793
Screw you, lady.

382
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:42,163
-Don't make me arrest you.
-You?

383
00:36:44,385 --> 00:36:45,963
Get the hell out of my way.

384
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:48,503
-You have the right to remain silent.
-You crazy bitch!

385
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,596
lf you give up that right,
everything you say...

386
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:54,058
could be taken down and used against you
in a court of law.

387
00:36:54,187 --> 00:36:55,432
Watch yourself.

388
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,449
So, he could have gotten the colour wrong.

389
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:12,578
Exactly. And besides,
just because the car was in both places...

390
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:16,572
hell, there's maybe
20, 000 red Explorers in the state.

391
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:18,790
Maybe 2, 000 in the county.

392
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,874
And that assumes
they stayed around and watched us.

393
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,543
On the other hand,
at least we have a credible witness.

394
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:30,049
Chief Stone.

395
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,886
Your secretary called ahead.
Andrew Lincoln.

396
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,595
-And this is my wife, Brianna.
-Hello.

397
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:37,562
-Hello. This is Officer Simpson.
-Hi.

398
00:37:38,397 --> 00:37:39,940
Please, come in.

399
00:37:47,657 --> 00:37:49,614
Suit, why don't you wait here?

400
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:53,908
-What did you just call him?
-Suit.

401
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:56,199
Short for "suitcase. "

402
00:37:56,749 --> 00:37:59,667
Like Harry "Suitcase" Simpson,
the baseball player?

403
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:00,908
Exactly.

404
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,334
-Please, sit down.
-Thank you.

405
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:08,217
So, is this about the killings?

406
00:38:08,344 --> 00:38:11,927
Yes, ma'am, it is. Your car
was in the parking lot of a murder scene.

407
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,467
Where that woman was shot.

408
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,051
That's where we first saw you,
investigating the crime scene.

409
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:18,640
How was I doing?

410
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:23,814
I was wondering if you own any guns,
specifically a . 22?

411
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:26,612
We do. Registered, of course. A . 22 rifle.

412
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:30,865
We used to plink vermin
at our country home from time to time.

413
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:33,946
I was wondering if I could borrow it
for a couple of days.

414
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,616
We'll just test-fire it
so we can cross you off the list.

415
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,120
-Of course, Chief Stone.
-Jesse.

416
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,209
I'll go get it.

417
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:52,002
It's a great view, isn't it?

418
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:56,509
On a cop's salary,
I could never afford a view like that.

419
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:02,979
Enjoy the seaside, then get to Palm Beach
so we don't freeze to death.

420
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,266
Good idea. What do you do, Mr. Lincoln?

421
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,446
I used to be an ophthalmologist.
I invented an ocular scanning device...

422
00:39:13,576 --> 00:39:17,075
that uses laser refraction
to detect corneal depth. lt's....

423
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,069
Anyway....

424
00:39:20,249 --> 00:39:22,621
So you don't practise medicine anymore?

425
00:39:22,752 --> 00:39:24,994
Why? Do you have something in your eye?

426
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:30,922
-Mrs. Lincoln?
-Brianna.

427
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:34,091
-Brianna, do you work?
-No, not now.

428
00:39:34,222 --> 00:39:36,594
We've been together about 15 years.

429
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:39,393
ln that whole time,
we've never had an argument.

430
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:42,852
-lt'd be pretty suspicious if we didn't.
-Have a fight?

431
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:47,022
-No, let you borrow the rifle.
-lt would.

432
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,607
I hope you get the son of a bitch, Jesse.

433
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,246
People come up from the city
and think they own the place.

434
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:00,866
Well, they do.

435
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:03,948
-He seemed nice.
-Just a stupid cop.

436
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:06,373
He didn't seem stupid to me.
He seemed polite.

437
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,710
He was staring at your ass, for God's sake.

438
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,713
I told you he wasn't stupid.

439
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,050
I'll have the lab check the rifle for ballistics.

440
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:41,030
And you feel in order to certify our copness,
we need to scarf these down?

441
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:42,741
Yes, I do.

442
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:46,867
-You're not going to eat a dozen donuts?
-Sooner or later.

443
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:50,584
You're right, it's been too long.

444
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:58,256
I want to know everything
about Andy and Brianna.

445
00:40:59,473 --> 00:41:03,720
where they live, where their country home
is, where they plink vermin...

446
00:41:03,853 --> 00:41:07,020
where he practiced medicine,
where he went to school.

447
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:13,945
"Plink vermin. "

448
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:18,609
Who the hell talks like that?
People don't talk like that.

449
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:21,234
As soon as we fire the thing, we'll know.

450
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,574
We'll know the bullets weren't fired
from that gun.

451
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:27,537
-What, do you think they have another gun?
-Two.

452
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:30,124
-And you think they did it?
-Yes.

453
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:32,497
You have everything you need but evidence.

454
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,380
-Except motive.
-Yeah, that, too.

455
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:41,346
But you never told them
about their car being at the parking lot.

456
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:44,143
There's no need to tell them all we know.

457
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,261
Because you've got some kind of instinct?

458
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:49,349
Because there's something
very phoney about them.

459
00:41:52,985 --> 00:41:57,113
But they're the only phonies whose car
was parked 10 feet from a homicide.

460
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,830
So, you gonna arrest me, or what?

461
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,799
-I'm walking out of here.
-No, you're not.

462
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,468
-You think you can stop me?
-Of course I can.

463
00:42:20,555 --> 00:42:22,179
You're all show muscle.

464
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,806
Hell, a 1 20-pound woman
hauled you in here in handcuffs.

465
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:59,706
-Who's the young lady?
-l don't know.

466
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,802
I found those pictures.

467
00:43:01,971 --> 00:43:04,047
-Where?
-School library.

468
00:43:05,224 --> 00:43:07,217
Somebody must have dropped them.

469
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:12,350
You aren't one of these guys
holding her down, are you?

470
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:15,055
Do you see my face
in any of those pictures?

471
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,688
You don't have to say any more, Bo.

472
00:43:20,823 --> 00:43:24,524
Rita Fiore. I'm Mr. Marino's attorney
and his son's.

473
00:43:24,744 --> 00:43:27,864
-l didn't do anything, Dad.
-What the hell is going on?

474
00:43:27,997 --> 00:43:31,911
I'm holding Mr. Marino's son
on a controlled substance charge.

475
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,202
You brought my kid in for smoking pot?

476
00:43:34,337 --> 00:43:37,421
You're looking at a police brutality suit.
I'll tell you right now.

477
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,173
Shut up, Mr. Marino.

478
00:43:39,842 --> 00:43:43,757
We've arrested your client
for possession of a controlled substance...

479
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:48,514
with intent to sell, resisting a lawful order,
and assaulting a police officer.

480
00:43:49,977 --> 00:43:53,097
And then there is the matter
of these pictures.

481
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,571
I could see my way to releasing Bo...

482
00:44:05,701 --> 00:44:08,702
if he would identify
the boys holding her down.

483
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:14,117
Chief Stone, my client is 17 years old.

484
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:16,291
He has no previous convictions.

485
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,172
You're not really gonna
keep him here overnight, are you?

486
00:44:19,298 --> 00:44:20,461
I am.

487
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:23,707
I want you to understand something, Bo.

488
00:44:23,845 --> 00:44:26,715
You deny knowing the people
in these pictures.

489
00:44:26,848 --> 00:44:31,141
lf you're lying to us,
it would be wise if you told us right now...

490
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,261
with your attorney present.

491
00:44:34,146 --> 00:44:35,771
I don't know them.

492
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:40,774
Officer Crane, please take Mr. Marino
to the holding cell.

493
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,692
Come on.

494
00:44:48,494 --> 00:44:52,112
-You son of a bitch.
-Chief son of a bitch to you.

495
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:55,620
Unless you want to spend
the night here, too...

496
00:44:55,751 --> 00:45:00,497
I suggest you and Miss Fiore go someplace
and plan your brutality suit.

497
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:04,586
I'll meet you outside.

498
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:17,391
Healey told me you were....
What did he say? lt was kind of cute.

499
00:45:18,524 --> 00:45:22,308
Oh, yeah.
He said you were a real straight shooter.

500
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:24,565
That is cute.

501
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,024
See you.

502
00:45:53,142 --> 00:45:56,807
-Why're you keeping the kid overnight?
-Because I don't like him.

503
00:46:00,107 --> 00:46:01,650
How was the father?

504
00:46:02,235 --> 00:46:05,105
The tree doesn't grow too far
from the apple.

505
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:11,032
lf you flip one of the other kids,
there might be a plea-bargain...

506
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,319
and she'd never have to appear.

507
00:46:16,582 --> 00:46:18,290
You look tired, Jesse.

508
00:46:19,085 --> 00:46:21,243
You can only do what you can do.

509
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:23,830
lf the killings aren't random...

510
00:46:23,965 --> 00:46:27,547
they're certainly connected
in a way only the killers understand.

511
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:30,426
Suit said you've got a feeling.

512
00:46:31,848 --> 00:46:33,306
Cop-ly intuition.

513
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:36,301
So, what are you gonna do?

514
00:46:36,936 --> 00:46:39,641
I'm gonna eat my pizza and mull.

515
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,392
Mulling's good.

516
00:46:42,817 --> 00:46:45,438
-Good night, Jesse.
-Good night, Moll.

517
00:46:46,028 --> 00:46:49,065
I know you're married,
but maybe we could have an affair.

518
00:46:49,198 --> 00:46:51,107
I'll put you on the list.

519
00:46:56,038 --> 00:46:58,245
Anyway, there's this banquet hall...

520
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:02,284
and it's brightly lit,
and there's a big, warm fire.

521
00:47:02,837 --> 00:47:04,794
And outside, it's cold and dark.

522
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:08,790
But inside, everybody's eating and drinking
and having a hell of a time.

523
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:12,129
And a sparrow flies
into one end of the hall...

524
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:14,421
out of the cold darkness.

525
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:18,765
He flies through the bright, warm hall
and out the other end...

526
00:47:18,895 --> 00:47:21,267
into the cold darkness again.

527
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:24,013
So?

528
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:28,653
Human life is like the flight of that sparrow.

529
00:47:30,823 --> 00:47:32,401
Or was it a swallow?

530
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,740
I don't remember. But the point's the same.

531
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:43,584
We're only here for a little while
and we have the right to make the most of it.

532
00:48:05,858 --> 00:48:07,518
Yeah, I know, Reggie.

533
00:48:43,563 --> 00:48:45,686
"You can only do what you can do. "

534
00:49:00,997 --> 00:49:02,788
Do you know Bo Marino?

535
00:49:05,084 --> 00:49:08,204
-Did he take those pictures?
-l don't know.

536
00:49:08,337 --> 00:49:11,671
-Was someone holding her feet?
-l don't know anything.

537
00:49:12,508 --> 00:49:13,884
Okay, Kevin.

538
00:49:14,594 --> 00:49:16,882
I'm gonna have to arrest you
for sexual assault.

539
00:49:17,013 --> 00:49:19,551
-No, wait a minute.
-Am I going to jail?

540
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:23,558
We have pictures of you...

541
00:49:23,686 --> 00:49:26,936
forcibly restraining a naked young woman
who is crying.

542
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,686
There's probably a crime
in there someplace.

543
00:49:30,276 --> 00:49:33,443
Tell him, Kevin. Was it Bo Marino?

544
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:39,527
-Do you want to go to jail?
-He'll be pissed at me.

545
00:49:42,121 --> 00:49:43,699
Was it Bo Marino?

546
00:49:49,503 --> 00:49:50,618
Yes.

547
00:49:52,507 --> 00:49:53,751
Who else?

548
00:49:58,054 --> 00:49:59,085
Yes.

549
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:06,934
-He's never been in trouble before.
-Now he is

550
00:50:07,897 --> 00:50:11,230
-But he's not gonna go to jail, is he?
-Not tonight.

551
00:50:11,943 --> 00:50:16,735
But, Mrs. Feeney, your son participated
in the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl.

552
00:50:17,823 --> 00:50:19,863
He'll have to answer for that.

553
00:50:22,161 --> 00:50:22,943
What else?

554
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,451
through 1990.

555
00:50:32,588 --> 00:50:36,538
They have two cars.
the red Explorer and a black BMW.

556
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:39,134
How'd you know that?

557
00:50:39,846 --> 00:50:43,890
I'm the police chief. I know everything.
Listen, I have to call you back.

558
00:50:47,895 --> 00:50:49,473
Hold that thought!

559
00:50:56,028 --> 00:50:59,314
-Miss Fiore.
-Save the "Miss" for court.

560
00:51:00,992 --> 00:51:02,700
ls this a house call?

561
00:51:03,744 --> 00:51:07,576
Pour me a drink, would you?
A very large, very dry martini.

562
00:51:09,876 --> 00:51:11,667
-You have kettle One?
-I do.

563
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:20,841
My plan was for you to be so taken
with me that you'd do whatever I wanted.

564
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,845
lt's working.

565
00:51:23,723 --> 00:51:27,174
That was a lousy way to get
Bo charged with sexual assault.

566
00:51:28,936 --> 00:51:30,181
He deserved it.

567
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,185
I could take you apart in court for that.

568
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:37,896
But if I did, how would I get you into bed?

569
00:51:49,415 --> 00:51:52,831
-Mostly, I'm thinking 'wow'.
-Good.  I like 'wow'.

570
00:51:53,753 --> 00:51:56,873
ln the small moments,
between thinking "wow"...

571
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:09,845
Try not to babble.

572
00:52:17,443 --> 00:52:19,851
I had to know what I was dealing with.

573
00:52:23,783 --> 00:52:26,238
You were a homicide detective
in Los Angeles...

574
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:29,785
but your marriage went south
and you had a drinking problem.

575
00:52:30,122 --> 00:52:32,448
-How's the marriage?
-Still south.

576
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,826
-And the drinking?
-Better.

577
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:39,504
I also know that
you have a serial killer operating here.

578
00:52:41,008 --> 00:52:43,678
-You must be stretched pretty thin.
-We are.

579
00:52:43,803 --> 00:52:46,757
But you still had time
to run down this rape thing.

580
00:52:47,974 --> 00:52:50,761
Usually, you get into
one of these small, suburban towns...

581
00:52:50,893 --> 00:52:54,476
they have a homicide,
and the State Police take over pretty quickly.

582
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:57,227
We try to handle as much
as we can in-house.

583
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:14,285
Buy me dinner!

584
00:53:15,543 --> 00:53:16,918
I'll dress up.

585
00:53:17,712 --> 00:53:19,704
Fluff up my body a little.

586
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:21,579
Wow.

587
00:53:28,848 --> 00:53:31,968
I know how much pressure
you must be under now...

588
00:53:37,857 --> 00:53:42,068
But we agreed that
if we blew the whistle and corroborated...

589
00:53:42,195 --> 00:53:46,572
we might not get them, and that would
make her life very difficult in Paradise.

590
00:53:47,575 --> 00:53:49,733
They were gonna show my picture
to everyone.

591
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:51,826
Now they probably won't.

592
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:58,334
I'll give a statement.
I'll testify, if I have to.

593
00:54:02,215 --> 00:54:04,540
-Get off me!
-You can't go in.

594
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:07,213
This is all bullshit. Kevin Feeney lied.

595
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:10,014
-I'm sorry, Skipper.
-lt's all right, Tony.

596
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:12,175
Close the door behind you.

597
00:54:14,894 --> 00:54:17,052
My kid told you he didn't threaten her.

598
00:54:17,188 --> 00:54:21,186
He told her that if she testified
against him, he'd kill her...

599
00:54:21,317 --> 00:54:23,357
Come on, it's just his
word against hers.

600
00:54:23,486 --> 00:54:26,771
-Don't force me to make that choice.
-What's that supposed to mean?

601
00:54:26,906 --> 00:54:29,575
lt means I have found Bo
to be a chronic liar.

602
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:32,865
I didn't do anything to the little bitch.

603
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,879
Let go of my son!

604
00:54:48,469 --> 00:54:52,337
Arrest him! I want that son of a bitch
arrested for assault.

605
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:06,070
I promise they won't assault you again.

606
00:55:06,445 --> 00:55:07,608
What?

607
00:55:11,367 --> 00:55:12,992
You saw the whole thing.

608
00:55:13,244 --> 00:55:17,372
I saw you and Bo insult Candace
Pennington and attack her father.

609
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:23,376
No, that's the way I saw it.

610
00:55:23,796 --> 00:55:25,041
Me, too.

611
00:55:25,631 --> 00:55:28,301
He punched my kid for no reason.

612
00:55:29,177 --> 00:55:31,253
I think there was a reason.

613
00:55:50,406 --> 00:55:52,695
What, the picture of you in my bedroom?

614
00:55:52,825 --> 00:55:55,494
What do you do with it
when you have a sleepover?

615
00:56:05,296 --> 00:56:07,917
-So, what do you think?
-About sleepovers?

616
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:11,917
No, about me coming up.
See, every news outlet in the country...

617
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:15,089
is dying for some sort of
inside something on this.

618
00:56:15,306 --> 00:56:16,421
I know.

619
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:20,765
I thought I could come out with
a cameraman and track the investigation.

620
00:56:20,895 --> 00:56:23,600
An inside look at how you're handling it.

621
00:56:24,232 --> 00:56:27,398
-No.
-We could do a whole series about it.

622
00:56:28,444 --> 00:56:30,982
-No, Jenn.
-I'd stay out of the way.

623
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:40,777
Hey, Abby.

624
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:53,685
Hey, Jesse.

625
00:57:56,157 --> 00:57:58,778
Two in the chest, just like the others.

626
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:02,113
Cold morning.
Might make the time of death a little harder.

627
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:03,409
Hey, Doc.

628
00:58:04,332 --> 00:58:05,530
Not now.

629
00:58:14,008 --> 00:58:15,668
Jesse, I'm sorry.

630
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:18,818
Maybe I should just say, "The hell with it, "
and be a drunk.

631
01:00:06,204 --> 01:00:09,703
I don't see what purpose is served
by locking these children up.

632
01:00:09,832 --> 01:00:13,782
You think they didn't know it was wrong?
That they couldn't control themselves?

633
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,419
-Well, they didn't.
-No plea-bargains. They deserve jail time.

634
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,920
Right now, Candace can't imagine
going to school tomorrow.

635
01:00:22,053 --> 01:00:25,504
She cannot imagine facing all the kids
that will know...

636
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,344
she was gang-raped
and photographed naked...

637
01:00:28,476 --> 01:00:33,185
and the three guys who did it
will be in the same school with her.

638
01:00:33,898 --> 01:00:35,357
Maybe the same class.

639
01:00:35,483 --> 01:00:38,519
I may not be a little girl anymore,
but I am a woman.

640
01:00:38,694 --> 01:00:40,853
And as a woman, I sympathise with her.

641
01:00:40,988 --> 01:00:43,693
Did the court specify
the community service?

642
01:00:44,867 --> 01:00:45,898
Not yet.

643
01:00:50,206 --> 01:00:54,619
Let me have each of them in a cell for
an hour. Let me beat the crap out of them.

644
01:00:55,795 --> 01:00:57,871
-You're joking?
-l am.

645
01:00:59,507 --> 01:01:03,505
But why not let them serve their sentence
with the police department?

646
01:01:04,095 --> 01:01:08,258
You would, of course, take your
supervisory responsibilities seriously.

647
01:01:08,391 --> 01:01:10,300
I would bust their chops

648
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:17,433
I'll see what I can do.

649
01:01:19,068 --> 01:01:21,986
What about unsolved murders
in the Cleveland area?

650
01:01:23,823 --> 01:01:27,073
A young girl was shot at a bus stop
in Parma, which is near Cleveland.

651
01:01:27,201 --> 01:01:29,241
I know where Parma is.

652
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:33,326
The only thing that matches this m. o...

653
01:01:33,457 --> 01:01:36,743
are two killings in Hilton Head, 1999...

654
01:01:36,878 --> 01:01:39,333
and three in Florida, 2002.

655
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:41,083
Where in Florida?

656
01:01:47,972 --> 01:01:50,724
There's a guy from CNN here.
He wants to speak with you.

657
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:54,935
He won't like that.

658
01:01:55,313 --> 01:01:58,729
There's a press briefing every morning.
Tell him where and when.

659
01:01:58,858 --> 01:01:59,889
Okay.

660
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:02,395
Maybe now we can get a search warrant.

661
01:02:02,528 --> 01:02:05,399
No judge is gonna give us a search warrant
with what we've got.

662
01:02:05,531 --> 01:02:06,812
And the weapons won't be there.

663
01:02:06,949 --> 01:02:09,654
-We can try.
-l don't want them to stop!

664
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:29,387
That's good work.

665
01:02:30,431 --> 01:02:32,720
You may make Detective someday.

666
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:36,803
We don't have any detectives.

667
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,265
Well... if we did.

668
01:03:01,337 --> 01:03:03,413
I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

669
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:07,551
She wasn't my girlfriend. She was my pal.

670
01:03:09,887 --> 01:03:11,346
No, thank you.

671
01:03:11,472 --> 01:03:13,761
-You're not drinking?
-l don't drink.

672
01:03:16,227 --> 01:03:17,686
I did, but I don't.

673
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:31,654
The DA went for your plan.
So what are you gonna do?

674
01:03:33,494 --> 01:03:37,408
I'm gonna take them over to Doc Perkins
and have them sterilised.

675
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:42,535
The Marino family wants me
to file charges against you.

676
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,964
-lt all happened so quickly.
-I'm sure.

677
01:03:48,176 --> 01:03:50,713
I could tell you're kind of slow to react.

678
01:03:50,845 --> 01:03:54,048
Bo attacked Candace's dad
who responded in self-defence.

679
01:03:54,182 --> 01:03:58,179
Then Joe Marino jumped in and Chuck
had to defend himself from both of them.

680
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:14,022
I was a prosecutor in a previous life.

681
01:04:15,244 --> 01:04:17,036
Don't beat yourself up.

682
01:04:17,496 --> 01:04:20,912
lt's the toughest kind of case:
motiveless, random killing.

683
01:04:21,459 --> 01:04:25,159
lt seems that serial killers only screw up
when it gets personal.

684
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:32,258
So, when do we go to court?

685
01:04:32,595 --> 01:04:35,168
This one isn't a winner for our side.

686
01:04:35,598 --> 01:04:37,923
I'll persuade my clients to drop it.

687
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:40,598
-And if they won't?
-They'll drop it.

688
01:04:45,066 --> 01:04:49,146
So, off the record, what really happened
with Bo and his father?

689
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:53,985
Pennington smacked the crap out of Bo
and his old man, and I let him.

690
01:04:54,617 --> 01:04:57,369
-I'm shocked.
-Not that shocked.

691
01:05:01,916 --> 01:05:03,825
lt'll be our secret.

692
01:05:04,293 --> 01:05:07,579
Perhaps before we're through,
there'll be several more.

693
01:05:27,733 --> 01:05:30,521
Ballistics came back on the third victim.

694
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:34,488
Same as the first two. Same two guns.

695
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,285
-Who else knows about this?
-So far, just you and me.

696
01:05:45,793 --> 01:05:47,501
lt's freezing out here.

697
01:05:48,212 --> 01:05:51,166
The day I left LAPD,
I drove out to Santa Monica...

698
01:05:51,299 --> 01:05:53,422
and just looked out at the ocean.

699
01:05:53,968 --> 01:05:57,004
I lost my wife and my job. lt calmed me.

700
01:05:59,348 --> 01:06:02,053
-Are you feeling that way now?
-No.

701
01:06:02,226 --> 01:06:03,507
I'm angry.

702
01:06:04,729 --> 01:06:06,389
They killed my friend.

703
01:06:06,522 --> 01:06:09,974
So you think it was intentional,
this killing your friend?

704
01:06:10,985 --> 01:06:12,016
Yes.

705
01:06:14,238 --> 01:06:15,816
I know who did this.

706
01:06:17,825 --> 01:06:20,826
I know who killed Eisley,
the woman in the parking lot...

707
01:06:20,953 --> 01:06:23,444
The guy in ther alley, and Abby...

708
01:06:24,832 --> 01:06:26,706
I know who killed them.

709
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:29,912
-Do you have a motive?
-No.

710
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:31,712
-Witnesses?
-No.

711
01:06:33,299 --> 01:06:36,216
Hell, I'll warm up a cell right now.

712
01:06:38,262 --> 01:06:39,756
There's two of them.

713
01:06:40,765 --> 01:06:43,552
And they're not gonna stop. I won't let them.

714
01:06:50,316 --> 01:06:53,317
So these two people,
they have an interest in killing people...

715
01:06:53,444 --> 01:06:55,900
and now they seem to have an interest
in killing you?

716
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:58,070
ls this a great country or what?

717
01:06:58,574 --> 01:07:03,153
Jesse, you might want to be a little careful
with these people.

718
01:07:05,373 --> 01:07:08,706
-I'm a little careful with everyone.
-The hell you are.

719
01:07:10,962 --> 01:07:13,713
lt would not be good to take this personally.

720
01:07:14,715 --> 01:07:17,289
I've been at this thing too long to be wrong.

721
01:07:17,426 --> 01:07:21,175
I'm not gonna sit around
and wait for someone to find another body.

722
01:07:32,859 --> 01:07:35,100
You just love to make me nervous.

723
01:07:42,368 --> 01:07:43,483
Need a ride?

724
01:07:45,538 --> 01:07:47,115
He's going to see you.

725
01:07:53,754 --> 01:07:54,952
That sounds good.

726
01:07:55,089 --> 01:07:57,545
-You know what sounds even better?
-What?

727
01:08:10,688 --> 01:08:12,562
I think he looks worried.

728
01:08:15,484 --> 01:08:17,810
Maybe we've been too hard on him.

729
01:08:18,863 --> 01:08:23,157
Human life is like the flight of that sparrow.

730
01:08:42,553 --> 01:08:43,964
This is Reggie.

731
01:08:44,805 --> 01:08:46,679
Thought you might need this.

732
01:08:50,603 --> 01:08:54,435
-They took a ballistics test?
-Yes, we did. We sent it to Boston.

733
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:57,854
Come into the living room.
Brianna doesn't wanna miss you.

734
01:08:57,985 --> 01:08:59,895
Bri, honey, it's Jesse.

735
01:09:03,824 --> 01:09:06,660
I assume it's not linked
to a drive-by shooting or anything.

736
01:09:06,786 --> 01:09:09,324
Actually, the rifle's never been fired.

737
01:09:10,081 --> 01:09:12,073
So much for plinking vermin.

738
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:15,038
-Must have been one of your other . 22s.
-No.

739
01:09:15,169 --> 01:09:17,043
I have no other guns.

740
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,078
Jesse Stone.

741
01:09:19,215 --> 01:09:20,543
-Brianna.
-Hello.

742
01:09:20,758 --> 01:09:23,130
What a beautiful dog you brought!

743
01:09:23,261 --> 01:09:25,586
Hello. What a sweet doggie.

744
01:09:25,721 --> 01:09:27,381
Hello, you little noodle.

745
01:09:27,515 --> 01:09:31,180
Actually, I've kind of adopted him.
He belonged to the first victim.

746
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:33,469
Well, that's awfully good of you.

747
01:09:34,856 --> 01:09:36,231
How sweet.

748
01:09:37,191 --> 01:09:40,109
-l think he likes you.
-Of course he likes me.

749
01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:44,948
You going someplace?

750
01:09:45,074 --> 01:09:47,909
Well, like we said,
we're only here a short time.

751
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:50,861
-When do you leave?
-Tomorrow night.

752
01:09:51,205 --> 01:09:55,037
-How's the investigation going?
-Actually, not too good.

753
01:09:56,127 --> 01:09:58,748
I hope the victims didn't suffer too much.

754
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,880
I wonder what it's like
to know you're gonna die.

755
01:10:02,592 --> 01:10:05,213
Have you ever been in that position, Jesse?

756
01:10:05,428 --> 01:10:09,128
I'm just a small-town cop.
Mostly, I give out parking tickets.

757
01:10:09,974 --> 01:10:12,547
lt must make everything very intense.

758
01:10:13,603 --> 01:10:17,470
I always wondered what it was like
for the shooter. That must be intense.

759
01:10:17,607 --> 01:10:20,477
Exercising the ultimate human power.

760
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:24,442
-lf he thinks about that kind of stuff.
-Do you think he does?

761
01:10:24,572 --> 01:10:28,023
I'm just a small-town cop.
Mostly, I give out parking tickets.

762
01:10:28,993 --> 01:10:32,327
-Do you have any leads?
-l was pinning my hopes on you.

763
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:35,324
Everyone needs a hobby.

764
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:40,076
Seriously, though,
why would we do such a thing?

765
01:10:41,339 --> 01:10:42,749
A shared sickness.

766
01:10:45,426 --> 01:10:47,335
At least we would be sharing.

767
01:10:54,644 --> 01:10:56,435
Who was the last victim?

768
01:10:58,606 --> 01:11:00,065
A friend of mine.

769
01:11:00,191 --> 01:11:03,275
Abby Taylor. I read that in the paper.

770
01:11:03,528 --> 01:11:06,731
lt must be very hard
when it's someone so close to you.

771
01:11:07,823 --> 01:11:08,903
I'm sorry.

772
01:11:10,451 --> 01:11:11,530
So am l.

773
01:11:17,208 --> 01:11:20,458
Abigail, oh, Abigail
Have you met Abigail?

774
01:11:21,712 --> 01:11:25,128
The queen of the tattooed ladies

775
01:11:28,261 --> 01:11:29,671
How is it?

776
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:33,421
My mother is kind of sulky.

777
01:11:35,226 --> 01:11:37,598
-And your father?
-Daddy's great.

778
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:41,056
I never saw him fight with anybody before,
for me.

779
01:11:44,277 --> 01:11:47,231
-You didn't try to stop it.
-He was winning.

780
01:11:48,698 --> 01:11:50,571
Daddy boxed in college.

781
01:11:50,867 --> 01:11:54,567
He must have been pretty good.
There's not a mark on his face.

782
01:11:54,996 --> 01:11:57,783
-Did you ever box?
-l don't box, I fight.

783
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:01,117
-What's the difference?
-Rules.

784
01:12:05,006 --> 01:12:07,045
So, how is it at school?

785
01:12:09,468 --> 01:12:13,252
Sometimes Bo or Troy will stare at me
when I go past.

786
01:12:14,265 --> 01:12:16,092
But they don't say anything.

787
01:12:18,436 --> 01:12:22,849
Everyone else, most of the kids,
have been okay about it.

788
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:25,264
Good.

789
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:38,574
I want you to know
I appreciate what you did for me.

790
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:43,330
-Could you do me a favour?
-Sure.

791
01:12:44,086 --> 01:12:47,538
Reggie here has got no owner, no family.

792
01:12:48,966 --> 01:12:50,793
I'm never home...

793
01:12:51,511 --> 01:12:54,048
and he really needs someone
to look after him.

794
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,932
-Could you do that?
-l don't know, my mum--

795
01:12:57,058 --> 01:12:59,300
I can talk to your mum about it.

796
01:13:00,311 --> 01:13:02,220
But you have to take care of him.

797
01:13:02,355 --> 01:13:05,521
-Feed him, walk him, clean up after him.
-l know.

798
01:13:06,817 --> 01:13:08,146
I can do it.

799
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,814
I know you can.

800
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:23,656
What?

801
01:13:26,212 --> 01:13:28,086
I'm sorry about your friend.

802
01:13:30,174 --> 01:13:31,716
Thank you, Candace.

803
01:13:55,408 --> 01:13:58,693
-So, why Abby?
-Because she was close to me.

804
01:14:00,913 --> 01:14:04,745
-So you think they want to kill you next?
-l kind of wish they'd try.

805
01:14:06,586 --> 01:14:08,662
I know they're not finished.

806
01:14:10,715 --> 01:14:14,415
They know where you live. Why don't
they lurk around your house and shoot you?

807
01:14:14,552 --> 01:14:17,043
They want to do something more artistic.

808
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:19,671
They are crazy. I tend to forget that.

809
01:14:19,974 --> 01:14:22,014
I think they made a mistake.

810
01:14:23,352 --> 01:14:24,847
lt's not random anymore.

811
01:14:24,979 --> 01:14:28,313
They seem to want to taunt me,
see my reaction.

812
01:14:28,983 --> 01:14:31,818
You might want to think
about being a little careful.

813
01:14:31,944 --> 01:14:33,355
I need evidence.

814
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:36,236
You think they'll come at you the same way?

815
01:14:36,365 --> 01:14:39,319
Serial killers like ritual.
They'll do it the same.

816
01:14:39,702 --> 01:14:44,079
Jesse, you're a good man and a good cop.
Better than this town deserves.

817
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:47,908
lt matters what happens to you.

818
01:14:48,878 --> 01:14:52,792
The ugly truth of it, Moll,
is it doesn't matter a hell of a lot to me.

819
01:14:53,841 --> 01:14:56,213
A lot of people love you, Jesse.

820
01:14:57,136 --> 01:14:59,259
-lncluding you?
-Especially me.

821
01:15:00,139 --> 01:15:02,630
And don't shut me off by being cute.

822
01:15:03,518 --> 01:15:05,510
lt's hard for me not to be cute.

823
01:15:16,781 --> 01:15:20,316
I think Reggie will be good for Candace.
That was sweet.

824
01:16:06,789 --> 01:16:10,657
I don't know if I thanked you enough
for all that you've done for me.

825
01:16:11,377 --> 01:16:14,828
I mean, you did so much,
and now maybe Reggie and....

826
01:16:16,674 --> 01:16:20,008
Well, ljust wanted you to know that
I'm your friend...

827
01:16:20,136 --> 01:16:23,172
and I feel really close to you.

828
01:16:42,575 --> 01:16:44,698
-It's Jesse

829
01:16:45,995 --> 01:16:49,079
Listen, I need to see you
both beofre you leave.

830
01:16:49,207 --> 01:16:53,703
The parking lot by the canal,
where Abby Taylor was killed. You know.

831
01:16:54,253 --> 01:16:56,542
-When?
-Tonight, 10. 00.

832
01:16:56,672 --> 01:16:58,297
ls this official?

833
01:17:14,774 --> 01:17:17,265
He thinks he's setting some sort of trap.

834
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:20,232
-Can he do anything?
-lt doesn't matter.

835
01:17:21,489 --> 01:17:24,940
This just makes it easier.
Now we know where he'll be.

836
01:17:33,334 --> 01:17:34,994
Why am I here, again?

837
01:17:38,881 --> 01:17:41,004
That's lovely and chivalrous of you...

838
01:17:41,133 --> 01:17:45,178
and I know you do it because you
care about me, but it's still dreaming.

839
01:17:46,264 --> 01:17:48,802
-You see anything, Sult?
-Nothing yet

840
01:17:56,023 --> 01:17:58,063
That's why I've got you, Molly.

841
01:18:16,335 --> 01:18:18,624
Jesse, I don't think they're coming.

842
01:18:32,685 --> 01:18:35,306
We'll get there as soon as we can.
You got that, Suit?

843
01:18:35,438 --> 01:18:36,552
On our way.

844
01:19:06,761 --> 01:19:09,762
-l won't have a dog in my house.
-This is different.

845
01:19:13,643 --> 01:19:16,098
-I'll take care of him.
-Except for when you don't.

846
01:19:16,229 --> 01:19:17,308
Dad.

847
01:19:22,985 --> 01:19:25,559
Margaret, this means so much to her.

848
01:19:25,905 --> 01:19:29,404
-You know the rule.
-Can't we bend the rule this time?

849
01:19:29,659 --> 01:19:31,117
Reggie needs a home.

850
01:19:31,244 --> 01:19:34,198
You know how I feel
about animals in the house.

851
01:19:34,413 --> 01:19:36,987
He's a great dog. He's already housebroken.

852
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:39,877
-I promise, I'll take care of him.
-Margaret.

853
01:19:40,419 --> 01:19:44,085
-But I really want him.
-l won't have a dog in my house.

854
01:19:44,423 --> 01:19:48,042
-This is different. I'll take care of him.
-Except for when you don't.

855
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:52,554
Candace isn't home.

856
01:20:29,427 --> 01:20:30,755
Pick it up.

857
01:20:35,641 --> 01:20:38,428
-And let you execute me?
-Pick it up.

858
01:20:41,522 --> 01:20:43,314
I didn't shoot anybody.

859
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:50,022
I may do some jail time,
but no court of law will execute me.

860
01:20:53,784 --> 01:20:55,824
I'll outlive you, Jesse.

861
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:05,868
Get up.

862
01:22:09,277 --> 01:22:12,443
Put the gun away, Suit,
before you shoot somebody.

863
01:22:16,284 --> 01:22:17,694
You all right?

864
01:22:21,414 --> 01:22:23,205
Two guns, one shooter.

865
01:22:24,876 --> 01:22:26,500
Give that to Healey.

866
01:23:33,986 --> 01:23:35,813
What are you looking at?

867
01:23:39,325 --> 01:23:41,650
Jesse, are you there?

868
01:23:44,622 --> 01:23:45,997
I'm sorry.

869
01:23:46,999 --> 01:23:51,460
I want you to know that I realise I was
thinking only about myself and my career.

870
01:23:51,921 --> 01:23:54,708
And I know
I've often been that way with you.

871
01:23:57,718 --> 01:24:00,589
Jesse, are you there?

872
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
