"The Accountant (2016)" ^ (Run time 02:07:54)

2
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:45,539
What the fuck?

3
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,433
Wait, let me call it in!

4
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,351
Move back!

5
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,157
Why are you doing this?

6
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:14,463
Take that, motherfucker!

7
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,677
Please.

8
00:01:32,702 --> 00:01:34,568
Just fucking stop it!

9
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:36,493
Put your gun down!

10
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:40,737
Come on.

11
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,187
Please.

12
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:46,368
I'm fucking begging you.
I didn't touch him.

13
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:48,176
I didn't touch that old man.

14
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:49,502
I wasn't even...

15
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:17,299
the accountant

16
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:21,795
Buried on Sunday.
That was the end Of Solomon Grundy.

17
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,038
Solomon Grundy.

18
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:30,783
Justine, please.

19
00:02:34,198 --> 00:02:37,418
It's called “stimming.”
It's self-stimulation

20
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:41,593
Where as, you and I might
tap our fingers, grind our teeth,

21
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:45,229
bite our nails.
Your son rocks back and forth.

22
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:48,247
It's more obvious,
but perfectly natural.

23
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:51,902
We came here, because we heard
you specialized in, in...

24
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:54,367
What is it?
What does he have?

25
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:56,957
Mm, not a fan of labels, ma'am.

26
00:02:57,332 --> 00:03:00,051
Your son is a remarkable young man.

27
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:03,009
Who goes crazy when
you turn the vacuum on.

28
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:06,323
Wears one Tee-shirt.
Won't let you hug him.

29
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:10,074
Loud noises, bright lights
can be especially difficult

30
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,638
for someone like your son.

31
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:15,628
The shirt, most likely fabric sensitivity.

32
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:21,365
Hugging, closeness, touching,
that can be a challenge, yes.

33
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,406
When it's somebody else's child,
it's a challenge.

34
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:29,029
When it's yours,
it's a problem.

35
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:32,530
My practice focuses on education.

36
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:35,411
I like to work with your son
at his speed.

37
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:38,842
Help him develop the skills
he'll need to live a full life.

38
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:43,122
Communicating, eye contact,
understanding non-verbal cues;

39
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:44,520
making friends.

40
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,433
The only friend he has
is his little brother.

41
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,219
I'm sure moving from
base to base doesn't help.

42
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:56,035
My husband's in the Army,
which means we all are.

43
00:03:56,664 --> 00:03:59,828
Would you be willing to let your son
stay with us for the summer.

44
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:03,534
Free of charge, working with me
in a sensory-friendly environment.

45
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:05,586
That's not going to happen.

46
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:10,124
If loud noises and bright lights
bother him, he needs more of it,

47
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,868
not less.

48
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,089
The world is not a
sensory-friendly place

49
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:17,786
and that's where he needs
to learn where to live.

50
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:20,656
Not in here.

51
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,142
Doctor, in your opinion.

52
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,042
Can our son lead a normal life?

53
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:28,722
Define normal.

54
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:31,241
I need to finish.
I need to finish.

55
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:34,177
Solomon Grundy, born on a Monday,

56
00:04:34,202 --> 00:04:37,087
Christened on Tuesday,
Married on Wednesday,

57
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:39,846
Took ill on Thursday,
Grew worse on Friday,

58
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:43,280
Died on Saturday,
Buried on Sunday.

59
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:45,229
I need to finish.

60
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:48,015
Solomon Grundy, born on a Monday,

61
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,870
Christened on Tuesday,
Married on Wednesday,

62
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:53,550
Took ill on Thursday,
Grew worse on Friday,

63
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:56,085
Died on Saturday...

64
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,529
Buried on Sunday.

65
00:05:28,255 --> 00:05:29,285
I...

66
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,368
I never thought of
myself as a quitter.

67
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:34,445
I'm a...
4th generation farmer.

68
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:39,798
But, between...
the property taxes and

69
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:43,344
fertilizer cost,
insurance.

70
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,741
Ah, the hell with it.

71
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,312
What if...
just temporarily mind you,

72
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:54,932
we put this year's taxes
on our credit card?

73
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,590
Do you like it?
I made it myself.

74
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:05,616
No, not particularly.

75
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:07,595
You ever sell one?

76
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,258
At church fairs now and again.

77
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:12,393
Mrs Rice, you may have what the IRS
calls a “a home-based business.”

78
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:14,666
What room do you use in your house
when you made those?

79
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:17,578
I don't, really.
Just wherever I happen to be, I guess,

80
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:20,460
in front of the TV,
at the kitchen table...

81
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:22,725
I'll spread my beads out in the dining room
but Frank...

82
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,732
Yes, it would be better if
you could try to remember

83
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:27,964
the one specific space
that you use.

84
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:30,260
Your home is 29,13 square feet.

85
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:33,228
IRS code allows us to deduct
from your taxable income

86
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:36,080
a percentage of your work space
relative to your overall...

87
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,620
- What?
- Mr Rice.

88
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:41,485
How big is your dining room,
Mrs Rice's office?

89
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,121
I wouldn't so much
as call it an office...

90
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:49,869
It's...
approximately 200 uh...

91
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,517
- Make it 300 square feet.
- Excellent.

92
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,679
- Mrs Rice.
- Dolores.

93
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,080
Dolores, when you order supplies,
do you order online?

94
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:05,860
I don't, I just run over
to the beads store.

95
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:06,977
Example?

96
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:09,952
I drive, the truck.

97
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,510
The company truck.

98
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:32,224
Come in.

99
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:38,060
Mr. King, you've wandered so far
outside your legal purview.

100
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:42,514
As the president of Southern Trust Bank,
I intend to protect my customer's privacy...

101
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,005
Stop talking. You have a very
cavalier attitude for the president of a bank

102
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,881
with such a piss poor capital cushion.

103
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:51,281
Now, I want a record of every transaction
Abayed has had for the last two years;

104
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:54,261
deposits, withdrawals,
cashier checks, credit cards.

105
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:57,667
Birmingham or Bahrain,
it is now Treasury business.

106
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:59,263
Good bye.

107
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:00,861
Medina.

108
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:04,002
- Am I saying that correctly?
- Uh, Medina, yes sir.

109
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:06,958
I've read all your case files,
Director King.

110
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:09,918
It's impressive work.
Very.

111
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:12,976
Marybeth Ascension Medina.

112
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:17,911
Graduated University of Baltimore cum laude
with a degree in criminal justice.

113
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:19,904
2 years Baltimore PD as an analyst.

114
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:22,874
2 more at Homeland,
analyst again.

115
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:26,608
And the last 5 years
here at Treasury.

116
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:28,296
Analyst.

117
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:32,633
You did the heavy lifting on
Agent Lorenz's case last month.

118
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:35,127
I worked on it, yeah
but Agent Lorenz...

119
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:38,416
Why haven't you applied
for promotion to agent?

120
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:40,633
You've already doing the work.

121
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:42,726
Analyst is a good fit.

122
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,537
And I enjoy the work.

123
00:08:44,562 --> 00:08:46,196
So...

124
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,805
Well, you're a liar, Medina.

125
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:59,970
Ward to the State of Maryland's foster care and
Juvenile Detention System from age 11 to 18.

126
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:03,612
Weapons chargers,  assault and battery.

127
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,992
Ouch, attempted murder.

128
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,860
Those records are sealed.

129
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:16,599
Is that a 9mm?
(Tattoo)

130
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,334
.45

131
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,653
You better sit your ass back down
in that chair, young lady.

132
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:25,981
This is a big moment for you.

133
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,220
Make a good choice.

134
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:44,170
Lying on a federal employment application
is a felony.

135
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,080
So, right now,

136
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:51,250
I'm the only thing standing between you
and significant prison time.

137
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:56,768
What do you want?

138
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:01,260
Do you like puzzles,
Marybeth Medina?

139
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:07,007
I meant what I said, son,
you're welcome out to the place anytime.

140
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:10,815
Do you fish? I got a two-acre pond
that is just thick with catfish and bass.

141
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,047
I don't fish.
I shoot.

142
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:17,104
Oh well, the farm's a perfect place
to do a little plinkin'. So...

143
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:21,268
Well, thank you.

144
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:23,586
You take care, son.

145
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:25,384
Thank you.

146
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:32,205
My daughter is meeting me for lunch.
I think you two just might hit it off.

147
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,164
Nice to see you.

148
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:37,503
Already enhanced.

149
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:40,948
It was taken 3 years ago in Antwerp
by an undercover Interpol agent.

150
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,672
Their target's on the far right.

151
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:44,858
Yeah, Zalmay Atta.

152
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:46,718
Go on.

153
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,384
Run the world's largest opium pipe line.

154
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:52,190
Ties to Karzai, Ghani,Taliban.

155
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:55,092
I mean he was considered untouchable.

156
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:57,937
Look at the rest.
Tell me what you see?

157
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,592
I remember most of these arrests...
they were huge.

158
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:11,336
Focus.
They're all not arrest.

159
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,462
It's the same man.

160
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,462
Lou Carrol.

161
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:31,629
For what it's worth.
It's an alias.

162
00:11:31,654 --> 00:11:33,974
The Hong Kong photo
was backed about 5 years.

163
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:36,915
And that one, he's Carl Gauss.

164
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:41,583
Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Nepal,
there was a sighting in Tehran.

165
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:43,379
All describing the same man:

166
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:46,962
“an accountant,” “our accountant,”
“the accountant.”

167
00:11:46,987 --> 00:11:50,579
“The Accountant”?
Like, “CPA accountant”?

168
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,515
Okay.

169
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:56,914
Say you're the head
of the Sinaloa Cartel.

170
00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:01,933
Now, the cartel count their money
by weighing it in eighteen wheelers.

171
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:04,981
But one sunny Mexican day,
your in-house money-scrubber

172
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:07,905
comes to you and says
you're thirty million light.

173
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,923
Who can you trust to do the
forensic accounting, track your stolen cash?

174
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:14,956
Deloitte and Touche?
H&R Block?

175
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:23,555
You somehow, contact an individual capable
of coming in cold, un-cooking years of books...

176
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,717
and getting out alive.

177
00:12:26,015 --> 00:12:27,360
I retire in seven months.

178
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:30,866
Before I do,
I need to know who he is.

179
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,442
How he does it.

180
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:35,201
I mean, who survives
this kind of clientele?

181
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:37,887
The secrets this guys has.

182
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:42,774
What exactly do you
want me to do?

183
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,877
Report directly to me.

184
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:46,654
No other case work.

185
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,523
No other Treasury personnel involve.

186
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:53,314
By the end of the month,
one of 2 things would have occurred.

187
00:12:53,695 --> 00:12:56,235
Resolution of this case,

188
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:01,027
or we update your photo.

189
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,542
ZOLOFT 100 mg

190
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:51,113
Mom! Mom! Mom!

191
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:52,418
Where are you going?

192
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:54,247
Mom!
Mom!

193
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,573
You just don't care.

194
00:14:57,598 --> 00:14:59,152
You always control him!

195
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:01,644
Mom!
No!

196
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:04,006
No!
No!

197
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:08,321
Mom!
Mom!

198
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,578
Mom!
Where are you going?

199
00:15:10,603 --> 00:15:11,977
- We had help!
- Then stay.

200
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:14,243
- You threw it away!
- Stay here, don't go anywhere!

201
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:19,934
- Mom!
- Hey.

202
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:23,640
Hey.
Hey.

203
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,371
That's it.

204
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,633
There we go.
There we go.

205
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:36,599
Solomon Grundy,

206
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:39,324
- Born on Monday.
- Solomon Grundy.

207
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:40,688
- Alright?
- Born on a Monday,

208
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:42,859
Christened on Tuesday,

209
00:15:42,884 --> 00:15:45,426
-There we go.
- Married on Wednesday,

210
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:47,405
Took ill on Thursday,

211
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,740
Worse on Friday,
Died on Saturday,

212
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:52,770
Buried on Sunday.

213
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,779
That was the end
Of Solomon Grundy.

214
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,521
Do it again.

215
00:15:57,546 --> 00:16:01,106
Solomon Grundy, born on Monday,

216
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:43,246
Looks like somebody's seen
too many westerns.

217
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:46,173
Yeah, he must be what...

218
00:16:47,164 --> 00:16:49,211
a mile out?

219
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:53,911
Not on my best day c...

220
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:08,834
Holy shit.

221
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:43,438
Okay, listen to me.

222
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:45,571
In... flec... tion, alright?

223
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:47,564
Listen, just listen to my tone.

224
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:50,581
I say,
"Oh, you look another year older."

225
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:54,381
"I don't know if I would ever
going to get out of this fucking place."

226
00:18:54,406 --> 00:18:55,960
And you say.

227
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:58,971
You're probably right, Francis.
You're extremely most unlikely to survive your...

228
00:18:58,997 --> 00:19:02,044
No, hold on.
That's not what you say.

229
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:04,619
2 years together every night,
you know.

230
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:08,079
I give you PhD in black money,
but you got to learn this.

231
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:09,778
- This is crucial.
- You're frustrated.

232
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:12,008
- What am I?
- You're frustrated.

233
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,021
That's what I am.
I'm frustrated.

234
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:15,515
Good, good.
Excellent.

235
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,008
Finally.
Alright, let's do another one.

236
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,209
Lights out, ladies.

237
00:19:21,282 --> 00:19:23,050
Lights out.

238
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:25,901
Names and addresses, go.

239
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:29,704
Cenyon Ivankov,
79 Primorsky Boulevard, Odessa.

240
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:34,434
The Meier brothers, Moushein and Tzak,
221 Sherwood Avenue, Jerusalem.

241
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:37,464
Dominick Rabito,
96 Court Street, Brooklyn.

242
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:38,831
Ask for Bobby.

243
00:19:38,856 --> 00:19:40,547
Ask for Bobby.

244
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:42,869
You know, I'm old,
I may be remembering things

245
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:45,255
a little rosier than they were.

246
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,239
I mean if you want to fill out 1040s
and itemized deductions,

247
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:54,334
pulling 50 grand a year, I mean it's a living,
because if you go down this road, this road...

248
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,007
You can't go back, you understand?
It's dangerous, do you understand?

249
00:19:58,032 --> 00:19:59,172
I understand.

250
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,999
You find one person
you can trust, just one.

251
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:06,568
And do not make my mistake,
you keep moving your ass around.

252
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,159
They gave me a new handler today.

253
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:21,015
I don't like this guy.
He's dull.

254
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:23,684
Worried.

255
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,308
Yeah, fuck it.

256
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,934
Good night, son.

257
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:36,284
Good night, Francis.

258
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:46,187
What about Zurich?
Or Saudi Arabia?

259
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,471
The Swiss are cheap.

260
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,179
Dubai is one thing but we're
too conspicuous in the Kingdom.

261
00:20:50,204 --> 00:20:52,139
- I vote Chicago.
- Why?

262
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:55,930
There's an update in online chatter,
people looking for you.

263
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,460
- What people?
- The unfriendly kind.

264
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:00,597
Let try a legitimate client for once.

265
00:21:00,622 --> 00:21:04,604
No cartels, arms brokers,
money launderers, assassins.

266
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:07,401
I like safe.
I like you safe.

267
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:11,164
Everyone's hiding something.
At least there's honor among thieves.

268
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:15,054
There is honor among
Illinois electronic manufacturers.

269
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:18,346
They're in your current backyard,
no risk of movement.

270
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:20,046
You'll meet?

271
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:21,760
Yeah, I'll meet.

272
00:21:21,785 --> 00:21:23,552
One last piece of business.

273
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:24,868
Just the Renoir.

274
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:26,809
I don't have a buyer
for the Renoir.

275
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:30,668
The Pollock can move.
Will you ever let it go?

276
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:33,257
Hello?

277
00:21:33,282 --> 00:21:36,631
Just the Renoir.
Drop the price.

278
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:39,623
Heavy sigh.

279
00:21:40,627 --> 00:21:43,431
Go to work, Dreamboat.

280
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:53,450
Uh, Mr. Wolff, I half suspect
we're wasting your time.

281
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,153
I'm quite sure you're not.

282
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:56,721
And you know this how?

283
00:21:56,746 --> 00:21:58,380
I'm on the clock.

284
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:03,122
Well, shit, I hope
we're not wasting ours then...

285
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:08,387
Look, kidding aside, I think if you saw
our books, you'd run for the hills.

286
00:22:09,214 --> 00:22:11,815
We have an incredibly
complicated accounting system,

287
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,446
depreciation schedules on
hundreds of different items,

288
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:18,726
full time and contract employees,
Department of Defense classified accounts.

289
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:20,057
It's a numerical shitstorm.

290
00:22:20,082 --> 00:22:23,074
I'll need to see all those books
for the past 10 years,

291
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:25,920
bank statements, a complete
list of clients and vendors,

292
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:29,084
hard copies printed out, my eyes only.
All the information is right here.

293
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:30,579
Okay, whoa, whoa.
Look.

294
00:22:30,604 --> 00:22:33,449
This all came to my attention
only last week..

295
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,708
Now, a junior cost accountant stuck
her nose where it didn't belong

296
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:38,924
and obviously had no idea
what she was looking at.

297
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:41,205
Lamar's overreacting,
there is no missing money!

298
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,641
How long have you been
CFO of this company, sir?

299
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,003
15 years.

300
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:47,570
I need the books for the
past fifteen, please.

301
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:49,822
Well, you're goddamn blunt.

302
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:52,247
I'm Lamar Blackburn's oldest friend.

303
00:22:52,272 --> 00:22:57,332
I've been by his side since he was turnin' out
RC robots that Radio Shack called crap.

304
00:22:57,357 --> 00:23:00,136
I wouldn't take a dime
without his say so.

305
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:03,879
- You're angry.
- Oh, this is bullshit.

306
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:07,316
Unusual way of making contact
with you, Mr. Wolff.

307
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,713
You were recommended
by Mansoor Lakhani.

308
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:13,711
We custom made prosthetics for
this man's daughter.

309
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:15,921
You may know that she lost
both legs to a car bomb

310
00:23:15,946 --> 00:23:18,576
outside his investment firm in Lahore.

311
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:23,832
He told my brother, Lamar,
that you were nothing short of supernatural.

312
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:30,802
Mr Lakhani holds advance degrees
in mathematics from Cambridge and Caltech.

313
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:33,818
Why does a man
like that need you?

314
00:23:34,678 --> 00:23:37,506
I don't discuss client business.

315
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:44,197
Carl Gauss -
5 years ago Hong Kong

316
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:51,352
CARL FRIEDRICH GAUSS

Lou Carroll -
Colombia , Tehran,  Tel Aviv

319
00:24:07,962 --> 00:24:10,599
Louis Carroll

320
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:11,421
What do you suppose that
young man is thinking right now?

321
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:15,217
Why do I still feel my arm?

322
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:19,907
How did everything
go so wrong so fast?

323
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,361
It's cold.
Turn up the heat.

324
00:25:24,812 --> 00:25:26,358
Christian Wolff, I presume.

325
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:27,431
Mr. Blackburn.

326
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:28,965
Lamar.

327
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:30,767
Lamar.

328
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:34,397
Come with me.

329
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,675
Are you aware of
Living Robotics' three income streams?

330
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:43,957
Consumer electronics, next generation prosthetics,
unmanned military applications.

331
00:25:43,982 --> 00:25:46,996
Prosthetics division showed
tremendous growth over the last 10 years,

332
00:25:47,021 --> 00:25:48,528
it's seems to have matured.

333
00:25:48,553 --> 00:25:50,918
Consumer product is your
highest source of revenue.

334
00:25:50,943 --> 00:25:55,377
followed closely by Defense department
contracts, prosthetics sits on three.

335
00:25:55,402 --> 00:25:58,971
You are well informed.

336
00:26:02,766 --> 00:26:05,758
I never married.
Never had kids.

337
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:08,090
This company is my child.

338
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,738
That's it, money has never
been a motivation.

339
00:26:10,781 --> 00:26:15,277
Balance sheets,
profit and loss statements.

340
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:18,753
My mind doesn't function
the way your's works.

341
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,740
I need you to be
my eyes and ears, Chris.

342
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:25,878
Whatever you need to do your job,
you let me know.

343
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:31,638
I'll start in the morning.

344
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:40,240
Zurich, Switzerland.

345
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:51,074
Son of a bitch.

346
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:05,887
Excuse me?

347
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:08,342
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

348
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:10,814
Do you know who
the fuck I am?

349
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,824
Simon Dewey.

350
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:16,553
The founder, CEO of Dewey Capital.

351
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,032
American.
Shocking.

352
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:22,809
I have kidnap insurance,
you obviously know that.

353
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:24,532
Sorry, but how would I
know that you have...

354
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:26,861
You people are fucking amazing...

355
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,426
You know, when you interrupt
somebody like that,

356
00:27:29,451 --> 00:27:33,847
it makes them feel that you're just not
interested in what they have to say.

357
00:27:33,857 --> 00:27:35,512
Or maybe you just think
what you have to say

358
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:37,707
is more important than
what I have to say.

359
00:27:37,732 --> 00:27:39,728
Is that what you think?

360
00:27:41,931 --> 00:27:45,984
That gun,
makes you a big man, does it?

361
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:48,620
This gun?

362
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:50,167
Come on.

363
00:27:51,615 --> 00:27:55,854
I'm part of a potent department
of a private security force.

364
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:59,493
We have a client, it's called a...
European manufacturing concern.

365
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:01,977
You're shortening their stocks simultaneously,

366
00:28:02,002 --> 00:28:04,706
spreading false rumors regarding
the harm of the company.

367
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:08,673
The result in declining stock price
has made you your millions, but...

368
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:10,663
It's been on my client's expense.

369
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:13,089
They have been forced to cut
hundreds of jobs, Simon.

370
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:16,841
These are third generation metal workers,
people with families.

371
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:19,625
Pensions are being rendered worthless
because of you.

372
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,094
But, you'll stop now, correct?

373
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:24,810
Which company?

374
00:28:24,835 --> 00:28:26,151
Wrong answer, Simon.

375
00:28:26,176 --> 00:28:27,454
Look..

376
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:28,615
Ow.

377
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:30,127
It's the same spot, Simon.

378
00:28:30,152 --> 00:28:32,779
Why'd you let me hit you
in the same exact spot?

379
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:34,337
I only meant.

380
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:36,556
We all chose positions
on dozens of companies.

381
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,124
Shit, Simon.

382
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,905
I suppose, you spreading false information

383
00:28:40,906 --> 00:28:43,835
about more than one company,
if that's what you're doing?

384
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,689
You just gonna have to stop
shortening them all.

385
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:48,888
That's ridiculous.
I can't be expected...

386
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,149
Alright, keep your chin up, son.
No pouting on my watch.

387
00:28:58,174 --> 00:28:59,972
Yeah, you're a man,
You're just...

388
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:01,991
You're a man in your own way.

389
00:29:05,114 --> 00:29:06,754
Alright, Simon.

390
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:12,185
I'm an avid reader
of the Journal.

391
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:16,135
So I expect cooperation
be reflected there.

392
00:29:17,393 --> 00:29:20,735
Simon, are we good?

393
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,256
Yeah?

394
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,426
Good boy, Simon.
I'm proud of you.

395
00:30:15,502 --> 00:30:16,647
Oh, hello.

396
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:17,820
Good morning.

397
00:30:17,845 --> 00:30:20,229
Oh.
Hi.

398
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:21,680
- Um...
- Hi.

399
00:30:21,705 --> 00:30:25,455
I'm Dana Cummings.
You're... the consultant, Mr. Wolff?

400
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,604
- Christian.
- Hi, Chris... tian. Um...

401
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:29,669
I'm Dana.

402
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,205
Cummings.

403
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:33,896
Yes.
Um...

404
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:37,936
These are all the files you wanted.
I cross-reference them

405
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,696
by year and alphabetical.
So...

406
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:42,387
It must have taken
you all night.

407
00:30:42,412 --> 00:30:44,279
It sure did.

408
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:49,395
Right.
So...

409
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,071
So.

410
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,106
What do you want, Dana Cummings?

411
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:04,333
Oh, Mr. Blackburn,
um...

412
00:31:04,903 --> 00:31:06,812
Sorry, he said I should...

413
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:09,883
I'm the person who first
noticed the missing...

414
00:31:09,908 --> 00:31:13,070
- what I think was the missing money.
- Yes, I understand. I'll find it.

415
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:17,905
Yeah, I thought we could...
have lunch and...

416
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,173
I brought my lunch.

417
00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:22,173
No, I bring my own lunch too.

418
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:24,595
I can answer any questions
that you have.

419
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,552
I have no questions.

420
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,444
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, you want to...

421
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,537
- make your own assessment.
- Yes, thank you.

422
00:31:34,737 --> 00:31:36,146
Okay.

423
00:31:36,171 --> 00:31:37,597
Um...

424
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:40,032
I'm in accounting
if you need anything.

425
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:43,744
There is a...
some donuts there for you.

426
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,654
I don't eat donuts.

427
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:48,216
Okay.

428
00:31:54,907 --> 00:31:56,749
Mr. Secretary.

429
00:31:57,053 --> 00:32:01,459
Sir, there's been speculation that
your ability to link banks in South Florida

430
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:05,991
to money laundering efforts of terrorists
are actually the result of a whistle-blower?

431
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:08,501
Or the NSA?
You care to comment?

432
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,508
Let me turn this over to
the head of my task force

433
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:13,976
Financial Crimes Director, Raymond King.

434
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:20,143
Folks.

435
00:32:20,168 --> 00:32:21,809
There's no great mystery here.

436
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:24,347
Nothing fancy.
Just team effort,

437
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:28,399
comprised of long hours of
good old-fashioned investigative work.

438
00:32:29,122 --> 00:32:30,667
Question?

439
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:39,323
Please, Sorkis,
give me something.

440
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:43,424
I match the face of the man in the photo
to a surveillance video in the NYPD data base.

441
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:45,297
Wait wait wait...
NYPD?

442
00:32:45,322 --> 00:32:47,105
What did you find?

443
00:32:47,905 --> 00:32:51,931
2006, your guy takes out
2 mob enforcers with a steak knife

444
00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:55,097
he lifted off from an Italian restaurant
down the street.

445
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:59,688
Then he strolls into a den of stone cold killers
and goes on a 7 mnn killing spree.

446
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:01,943
Using their own weapons.

447
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,652
Head shot, head shot,
head shot.

448
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:06,859
Sorkis, stop.

449
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,230
The den of stone cold
killers, where is this?

450
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:12,251
Ravenite, headquarters of the
Gambino crime family.

451
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:15,128
He killed Anthony,
"Little Tony" Bazzano.

452
00:33:15,153 --> 00:33:17,982
Forensics list cause of death
as blunt force trauma.

453
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:20,942
Your boy kicked him in the head, once.

454
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:23,975
Again, play it again.

455
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,475
Hey, hey, hey.

456
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:31,621
I better call it in!

457
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,023
I also got an audio file here.

458
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:37,668
Inside of the Ravenite,
it was bugged.

459
00:33:38,838 --> 00:33:40,571
Come on.

460
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,389
Please.

461
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:44,125
That's Little Tony.

462
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,052
I'm fucking begging.
I didn't touch him.

463
00:33:47,077 --> 00:33:48,354
I didn't touch that old man!

464
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:49,853
Okay, give me the recording ASAP.

465
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:51,184
I wasn't even...

466
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:57,354
MB, you're an analyst for Treasury.

467
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:00,710
What the hell have you
got yourself into?

468
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,813
What do you have to hit
to dent a steel thermos?

469
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:34,620
It's just old.

470
00:34:39,473 --> 00:34:43,359
How did you, um...
get into financial consulting?

471
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:48,525
Department of Labor statistics indicate it's
one of the fastest growing professions.

472
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,382
Actuarial sciences are experiencing
a tremendous growth as well.

473
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,518
Okay.

474
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,362
I like the balance of it.

475
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:05,874
You know, like finding things
that aren't obvious.

476
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:09,368
Plus my dad was an accountant.

477
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:11,800
He actually...

478
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:15,376
You know, he had
the whole schtick.

479
00:35:15,401 --> 00:35:17,019
He..

480
00:35:17,674 --> 00:35:20,567
You know, the little amortization book,
with the green eye-shade.

481
00:35:20,592 --> 00:35:23,364
The, like dorky
pocket protector and...

482
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:25,563
I've got a pocket protector.

483
00:35:27,996 --> 00:35:31,423
That's a nice one.
I mean, his was dorky, I guess.

484
00:35:31,448 --> 00:35:33,386
Yours is nice.

485
00:35:34,937 --> 00:35:36,962
Yeah, but he convinced me to go
into the field.

486
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:40,811
Because I wanted to study art.
At the Art Institute of Chicago. But...

487
00:35:40,836 --> 00:35:42,548
Art doesn't pay the mortgage.

488
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,091
"Art doesn't pay the mortgage, young lady."

489
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:49,011
Dad's tastes ran more to
Dogs Playing Poker.

490
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,221
I like Dogs Playing Poker.

491
00:35:51,598 --> 00:35:55,876
Because dogs would never bet on things.
So it's incongruous.

492
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,658
I like incongruity.

493
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,484
Yeah, Dogs Playing Poker is nice.

494
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:10,239
It's just sort of...
just different.

495
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:14,573
So I studied accounting at the University
of Chicago. “Where fun goes to die.”

496
00:36:14,598 --> 00:36:16,089
Why?

497
00:36:17,112 --> 00:36:18,753
Why what?

498
00:36:18,778 --> 00:36:22,254
Why does fun go to die at
the University of Chicago?

499
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:24,906
Oh, no.
It's just an expression.

500
00:36:27,122 --> 00:36:28,885
I'm joking.

501
00:36:33,336 --> 00:36:34,925
Right.

502
00:36:44,698 --> 00:36:47,021
- I'll leave you to it.
- Okay.

503
00:36:47,046 --> 00:36:49,961
Let me know if you need
anything while you're here.

504
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:55,105
- Have a nice day!
- Yes, you too.

505
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:53,037
I'm fucking begging.
I didn't touch him.

506
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:55,048
I didn't touch that old man.

507
00:38:55,073 --> 00:38:56,477
I wasn't even...

508
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,229
Okay..

509
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:09,481
Give me something.

510
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,579
I..

511
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:18,668
I'm fucking begging.
I didn't touch him.

512
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:21,855
I didn't touch that old man.
I wasn't even...

513
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,938
<font color="#ff8080">Subfloor Vocal Track Isolated</font>

514
00:40:10,178 --> 00:40:13,341
Solomon Grundy, born on Monday,

00:40:13,365 --> 00:40:15,097
Christened on Tuesday,

Born on a Monday,

Married on Wednesday,

519
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:39,104
Come in. Come in. Come in.

520
00:40:39,129 --> 00:40:40,740
You have to see this.
Look at this.

521
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:42,886
It's going to blow you away.

522
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:46,583
I mean, it'll just...
jump right out at you.

523
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:51,211
- There it is.
- Uh-huh.

524
00:40:51,236 --> 00:40:54,468
Living Robotics, 10 years ago,
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation,

525
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:57,157
 $14,495,719.

526
00:40:57,182 --> 00:41:01,920
9 years ago. earning
before tax depreciation.

527
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:05,094
Revenues go up, profits go down.

528
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,669
No large capital expenditures
dragging profits down.

529
00:41:07,694 --> 00:41:10,214
No spike in raw materials
or labor costs.

530
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:12,592
Year 8, profits and revenue
both go up,

531
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:15,751
but not at a comparable fashion.
X no longer equals Y.

532
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,369
6, 5, 4, 3.

533
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:20,314
You're making money
but there's a leak.

534
00:41:20,348 --> 00:41:22,295
The leak is...

535
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,815
The leak.
Where's the leak?

536
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:30,013
SLEWITT manufacturing.
I signed these checks.

537
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:31,843
- Who authorized it?
- Ed... Mr. Chilton.

538
00:41:31,868 --> 00:41:34,667
They make electronic assemblies for
the consumer division.

539
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:37,580
No, they don't.
Look at this.

540
00:41:38,032 --> 00:41:39,921
You notice anything?

541
00:41:41,504 --> 00:41:44,257
- Second number in each is a 3.
- Yeah.

542
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:47,993
Most people, when generating random numbers
tends to relies subconsciously on certain...

543
00:41:48,018 --> 00:41:49,336
- ... patterns.
- Patterns. Yeah.

544
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:50,374
Yes.

545
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:52,433
- I was right.
- You were right.

546
00:41:53,397 --> 00:41:55,248
- Yeah.
- Uh, I'm...

547
00:41:55,249 --> 00:41:59,452
I went through these ledgers for months.
And I got through one fiscal year.

548
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:01,251
You went through 15.
Overnight.

549
00:42:01,276 --> 00:42:03,854
It's not even the best part, look.
This part is...

550
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:06,252
They're routing money to a company
that doesn't exist.

551
00:42:06,277 --> 00:42:09,405
And yet profits go up,
and they continue going up.

552
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,930
It absolutely makes no sense.

553
00:42:10,955 --> 00:42:13,391
- Where's the money coming from?
- Where's the money coming from? Exactly!

554
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,916
- It's not inventory?
- Inventory checked out.

555
00:42:15,941 --> 00:42:18,309
- Chargebacks to vendors?
- No, perfectly in order.

556
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,641
Internal offsets?

557
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,465
No, that's a terrible idea.

558
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:23,487
Um.

559
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:30,896
Cummings.

560
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:34,885
You're needed in whatever area
I'm paying you to be needed in.

561
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,541
Sorry.

562
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:51,215
And?

563
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:59,439
3 million, three hundred forty five...
6 million, three hundred ninety seven...
12 million...

564
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:04,116
Sixty one million, six hundred and seventy nine thousand...
$ 61,679,000 ...

565
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:06,344
and some change.

566
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:09,011
Who did it?
Best guess?

567
00:43:09,036 --> 00:43:11,059
I don't guess.

568
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:14,696
You'll have a report for me?

569
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:17,449
When I'm finished,
yes.

570
00:43:50,536 --> 00:43:52,264
Hey, Ed.

571
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,049
We're having lemon meringue pie.

572
00:43:55,074 --> 00:43:57,555
And those two bottles of insulin.

573
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:06,348
I just thought that you'd appreciate
me treating you like an adult, right?

574
00:44:06,373 --> 00:44:08,252
So here's what I got.

575
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:20,395
You administer your own accidental
insulin overdose, and just die

576
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,338
but do it with dignity.

577
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:25,374
Your wife whose sleeping upstairs,

578
00:44:25,398 --> 00:44:30,043
she'll be the beneficiary of, what's got to be,
a very generous insurance policy,

579
00:44:30,068 --> 00:44:31,313
 am I right?

580
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,431
But the only way she's going
to collecting that policy, Ed,

581
00:44:33,456 --> 00:44:36,401
 is that we have the
appearance of an accident.

582
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:40,324
If we lay hands on you,
you're gonna fight, squeal,

583
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:42,315
she wakes up,
my hands are tied.

584
00:44:42,316 --> 00:44:44,627
One accidental death is just that.
Two?

585
00:44:44,638 --> 00:44:49,652
No, I'll have no choice but to
rock and roll a home invasion,

586
00:44:49,676 --> 00:44:51,501
violate your wife
a dozen different ways,

587
00:44:51,526 --> 00:44:54,354
kill you both, burn the
place to the ground.

588
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,341
I'm sorry for that.
Ed, Ed, Ed, hey.

589
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:02,398
Nobody's gonna violate your wife, okay?

590
00:45:02,445 --> 00:45:06,486
Besides, what that would say
about me as a human being?

591
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:08,723
Physiologically, it's a non-starter.

592
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:13,587
Sometimes I think I just say shit,
say a poop comes out of my mouth.

593
00:45:14,398 --> 00:45:17,554
I will however plug a .45
in your brainpan.

594
00:45:18,477 --> 00:45:20,869
I don't mind commitments.

595
00:45:20,894 --> 00:45:25,698
It's kind of sad you and your
sticky fingers probably find hard to grasp.

596
00:45:30,497 --> 00:45:32,769
Make a decision, sir.

597
00:45:43,872 --> 00:45:46,745
Where are you going?
Sir.

598
00:45:50,188 --> 00:45:52,189
Stop that. Why're you doing that?
Stop that!

599
00:45:52,214 --> 00:45:53,411
Sir.
Sir.

600
00:45:53,436 --> 00:45:55,244
What are you doing?
Excuse me.

601
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:57,432
Mr. Chilton passed away.

602
00:45:57,457 --> 00:45:59,817
I was told to
clean up the room.

603
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:02,052
What's happening?

604
00:46:03,624 --> 00:46:05,944
Could you give us a minute, please?

605
00:46:08,715 --> 00:46:10,732
This is the balance of your contract.

606
00:46:10,757 --> 00:46:12,748
- I understand you're upset.
- Yes, I'm upset.

607
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:15,742
- But I haven't finished yet.
- Yes, you have.

608
00:46:15,742 --> 00:46:17,585
Ed was a diabetic for 30 years.

609
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:20,200
You think he didn't know how
to check his blood sugar?

610
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:23,130
Whatever unresolved issues remain,

611
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:26,887
my friend was poisoned enough
by them to take his own life.

612
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:30,209
As far as I'm concerned
whatever he did is forgiven.

613
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:31,830
Please... I need to finish.
Please.

614
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,736
- Sorry, I'll come back.
- No, no. Come in, dear.

615
00:46:35,658 --> 00:46:37,292
We're done.

616
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:41,151
You're very good, Mr. Wolff.

617
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:44,217
But, I hope our paths
never cross again.

618
00:46:44,504 --> 00:46:47,725
I'm responsible for the
death of my best friend.

619
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,893
I'd prefer not to be
reminded of it.

620
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,351
Do you think that's true?

621
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:07,565
That Mr. Chilton killed himself?

622
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:10,280
That makes you think we're responsible?

623
00:47:10,557 --> 00:47:13,706
It's very hard for me to interpret
what people do what they do.

624
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,534
This...

625
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:20,896
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished.

626
00:47:21,893 --> 00:47:25,066
I mean look.
Look at this.

627
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:27,968
SIMOPS reports.
This is out of order.

628
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:29,898
They completely re-rearrange this.

629
00:47:29,923 --> 00:47:31,508
I don't.
I...

630
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:33,880
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished.

631
00:47:38,808 --> 00:47:40,466
Bye, Chris.

632
00:50:20,633 --> 00:50:22,082
Again.

633
00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:45,609
Enough.

634
00:50:50,544 --> 00:50:52,009
They're not done.

635
00:50:52,034 --> 00:50:56,037
Tomorrow is another day.
They have done their best.

636
00:50:56,274 --> 00:50:59,929
If that were true, you would
be covered in blood and snort, not them.

637
00:51:01,004 --> 00:51:02,688
Keep going.

638
00:51:14,881 --> 00:51:19,187
Aggression correctly channel
overcomes a lot of flaws.

639
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:27,066
Tapping into that aggression requires
peeling back several layers of yourself.

640
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:31,326
It's my job to know
my son's limitations.

641
00:51:32,558 --> 00:51:34,238
Get up.

642
00:51:35,795 --> 00:51:37,596
It's your job to peel.

643
00:51:37,621 --> 00:51:40,435
Do your job.
On your feet.

644
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,030
Again.

645
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:08,365
We could have went to his house.

646
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:11,237
Shot him in his home.
We would be on a plane by now.

647
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:15,561
Or on a security camera,
or some nosy neighbor's iPhone.

648
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:21,180
Call the bookkeeper in.

649
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:23,631
He's too far,
he won't hear...

650
00:52:23,656 --> 00:52:24,986
- Now.
- ... me.

651
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:26,768
Let's go.
Get up.

652
00:52:26,793 --> 00:52:28,295
Come on.

653
00:52:30,254 --> 00:52:31,954
Move.

654
00:52:33,545 --> 00:52:35,356
Come on, come on, come on.

655
00:52:40,993 --> 00:52:43,198
Christian!

656
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:48,145
Chris!

657
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:53,901
Again.
Louder.

658
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:55,548
Chris...

659
00:53:03,733 --> 00:53:05,701
- No! No! Please!
- What the fuck?

660
00:53:05,726 --> 00:53:07,242
Dolores!

661
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:12,846
- She's coming with me.
- I say, stop it! Leave her be!

662
00:53:12,871 --> 00:53:14,331
Shit!

663
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,489
We're all going together.

664
00:53:19,513 --> 00:53:23,142
Just pull that truck around the back.
Let's go. Let's go!

665
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:28,315
Let's move.

666
00:53:28,932 --> 00:53:32,087
Come on, drive!
Drive now!

667
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:44,098
What the fuck?

668
00:54:33,314 --> 00:54:35,455
What the fuck?

669
00:54:47,922 --> 00:54:51,275
When I say the name of your employer,
you say ''Yes''.

670
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,838
Practice.

671
00:54:52,925 --> 00:54:54,369
Yes.

672
00:54:54,927 --> 00:54:59,649
Camorra... Juarez... Gambino...

673
00:55:00,235 --> 00:55:02,331
Do you understand the rules?

674
00:55:02,356 --> 00:55:04,807
My left pocket.

675
00:55:07,725 --> 00:55:10,881
Kill you both,
that's all I know.

676
00:55:32,805 --> 00:55:34,921
- Hello, Dreamboat.
- Dana's in danger.

677
00:55:34,946 --> 00:55:37,754
Kill Christian Wolff.
Transfer all domestic accounts overseas.

678
00:55:37,779 --> 00:55:40,129
- Current vehicle?
- F-150.

679
00:55:40,499 --> 00:55:43,543
- Virus to triple Z?
- Wipe everything.

680
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:47,014
And... done.
In the D-O-T data base now...

681
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:48,976
reassigning the license and vin.

682
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:51,685
I have “George Boole” or
“Charles Babbage” in the queue.

683
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,492
Boole.
Obviously.

684
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,044
Silly of me.
What else?

685
00:55:57,056 --> 00:55:58,552
She is not your problem.

686
00:55:58,577 --> 00:56:01,102
Straight to the trailer,
hook it up and disappear.

687
00:56:01,127 --> 00:56:04,574
There's no time,
only the trailer.

688
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:08,268
Address and phone number.
Get it.

689
00:56:39,085 --> 00:56:41,246
She's not answering.

690
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,554
We could use a small box.

691
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:15,737
She looked bigger in the photo.

692
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:20,691
God!

693
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,991
God damn!
Bitch!

694
00:59:36,954 --> 00:59:38,593
We should go.

695
00:59:44,137 --> 00:59:47,222
Since when are accountants
difficult to ventilate?

696
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:49,728
Dead?

697
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:53,099
Are you crazy, what did he do?
Hit him over the head with an adding machine?

698
00:59:57,186 --> 00:59:59,290
Oh God.

699
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:04,778
Alright, just...
Put me in touch with the client.

700
01:00:04,865 --> 01:00:07,661
I'll handle this accountant myself.

701
01:00:10,323 --> 01:00:13,210
Running isn't an option for me.
I can't just walk out on my life!

702
01:00:13,212 --> 01:00:16,543
We've to go to the police!
That's what normal taxpaying people do!

703
01:00:16,568 --> 01:00:20,744
The police can't protect you from someone
who could afford to return 61 million dollars.

704
01:00:20,769 --> 01:00:22,585
Return?
What are you talking about, "Return".

705
01:00:22,617 --> 01:00:24,550
The money was being put back.

706
01:00:24,575 --> 01:00:26,087
Stay here.

707
01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:28,362
What are you doing in here?

708
01:01:28,387 --> 01:01:31,131
- Who are you?
- You can't... You should not be here.

709
01:01:31,156 --> 01:01:33,682
Sit down.
Sit right there.

710
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:38,888
What is this place?

711
01:01:39,517 --> 01:01:42,157
Panamerica Airstream.

712
01:01:42,183 --> 01:01:44,977
34 feet 7 inches long.

713
01:01:45,299 --> 01:01:47,802
8 feet 5 inches wide.

714
01:01:47,826 --> 01:01:52,493
The dimensions which are perfectly
adequate for one person, preferable.

715
01:01:53,428 --> 01:01:55,100
This is where you live?

716
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:56,925
No.
I don't live here.

717
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:59,292
This is a storage unit.
That would be weird.

718
01:01:59,317 --> 01:02:01,030
That's what would be weird?

719
01:02:01,055 --> 01:02:03,046
I just spend more time here.

720
01:02:03,071 --> 01:02:06,816
However, I'm afraid some of
my clients have followed me.

721
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:10,298
Why would your clients follow you?
You're an accountant.

722
01:02:10,328 --> 01:02:13,297
How do you know what to do here?
Why are you prepared for this?

723
01:02:13,331 --> 01:02:14,949
Plus, this is on wheels.

724
01:02:14,974 --> 01:02:18,368
Which means I could hook it and
be gone in 12 minutes, usually.

725
01:02:18,393 --> 01:02:21,388
Sarcasm.
Is that sarcasm?

726
01:02:21,413 --> 01:02:24,484
No, that's not sarcasm.
I don't use sarcasm material please.

727
01:02:24,509 --> 01:02:27,299
Everything in the world that
is important to me, is in this trailer.

728
01:02:27,324 --> 01:02:30,465
And right now, changing my routine
for you is jeopardizing that.

729
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,381
Tell me that's not
an original Pollock.

730
01:02:41,855 --> 01:02:43,462
We should go.

731
01:02:45,594 --> 01:02:47,087
Now.

732
01:03:02,547 --> 01:03:04,302
- Medina.
- Ms. Medina.

733
01:03:04,327 --> 01:03:07,166
This is Gordon Amundson
with the FBI Language Services.

734
01:03:07,191 --> 01:03:09,225
Ah, yeah.
Anything luck?

735
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,432
It's an unusual audio file.

736
01:03:11,457 --> 01:03:15,324
Solomon Grundy is a nursery rhyme,
circled in 1800s.

737
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:19,873
Your voice has four of the six intonation
patterns we use to define American English.

738
01:03:19,898 --> 01:03:22,833
That's difficult to confirm with a rhyme.

739
01:03:22,834 --> 01:03:26,014
Out of curiosity...
was your subject a trauma victim?

740
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:28,196
Um.
Why you ask that?

741
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,669
Well, you indicated on your submission,

742
01:03:30,694 --> 01:03:33,565
that this event occurred
in a high-stress environment?

743
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:35,670
Yeah, exceptionally.

744
01:03:35,694 --> 01:03:37,003
That's interesting.

745
01:03:37,028 --> 01:03:40,676
The first was repeated
a total of four and a half times.

746
01:03:40,701 --> 01:03:47,171
Zero variation in pitch, stem, tempo,
volume or articulatory precision.

747
01:03:47,196 --> 01:03:49,401
So what does that mean exactly?

748
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:53,878
We often see this type of repetitive chanting
in children who have been exposed to trauma

749
01:03:53,903 --> 01:03:56,674
or persons with neurodevelopmental disorders.

750
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:58,581
"Neurodevelopmental disorders?"

751
01:03:58,606 --> 01:04:01,485
Fragile-X syndrome, autism.

752
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:05,098
Okay, so, let's say
I was looking at mug shots,

753
01:04:05,126 --> 01:04:08,704
how would that present itself,
what exactly am I looking for?

754
01:04:08,729 --> 01:04:13,848
Fragile-X, elongated face,
protruding ears, poor muscle tone.

755
01:04:13,873 --> 01:04:16,596
Autism is nearly impossible
to identify visually.

756
01:04:16,621 --> 01:04:21,427
The traits are behavioral.
Difficulty with social reaction and communication.

757
01:04:21,452 --> 01:04:23,618
Lack of eye contact.

758
01:04:23,815 --> 01:04:26,182
Lack of eye contact.

759
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:28,474
Okay.

760
01:04:28,499 --> 01:04:31,013
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

761
01:04:59,952 --> 01:05:02,178
Asperger's Syndrome

762
01:05:02,187 --> 01:05:04,921
Mathematician

763
01:05:10,294 --> 01:05:13,277
<font color="#ff9b6a">The Prince of Mathematicians</font>

764
01:05:21,488 --> 01:05:23,247
None of this makes sense.

765
01:05:23,272 --> 01:05:26,599
Why go to the trouble of skimming
the money, if you're going to put it back?

766
01:05:26,624 --> 01:05:32,262
Over the last 3 years, the number of invoices
submitted by Slewitt Manufacturing had declined.

767
01:05:32,287 --> 01:05:34,489
Scared of getting caught?

768
01:05:35,544 --> 01:05:36,691
Price hike?

769
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:39,122
The prices of consumer electronics 
go down not up.

770
01:05:39,147 --> 01:05:41,785
Right. Down, yeah.
Um...

771
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:44,598
I can't afford this.

772
01:05:44,623 --> 01:05:46,901
I know.
My treat.

773
01:05:49,115 --> 01:05:54,123
In the U.S, 104 men,
last name any standard derivation

774
01:05:54,148 --> 01:05:56,729
 if you were a mathematician
called Gauss.

775
01:05:56,754 --> 01:06:02,293
Reported over $500,000
in any of the last 7 years.

776
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:04,651
Okay, go a million plus.

777
01:06:05,473 --> 01:06:06,773
17.

778
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:10,834
Of the 17, how many
between the age of 25 to 45?

779
01:06:11,053 --> 01:06:12,619
4.

780
01:06:12,644 --> 01:06:15,381
Of those 4, only one
has an income stream

781
01:06:15,406 --> 01:06:17,863
that's cash heavy or easily laundered.

782
01:06:17,888 --> 01:06:19,689
And he...

783
01:06:20,279 --> 01:06:22,231
died 3 years ago.

784
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:29,787
What's this?

785
01:06:29,812 --> 01:06:33,087
Names of the 100
most famous mathematicians.

786
01:06:34,606 --> 01:06:36,879
Look, we know what we're doing now.
So, just...

787
01:06:36,904 --> 01:06:39,450
enter the names, narrow down
the search right off the map.

788
01:06:39,475 --> 01:06:43,725
Male, Caucasian, 25 to 45.
Earning a million plus.

789
01:06:43,768 --> 01:06:47,417
No investment income,
he'll concentrate on cash.

790
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,936
What's in it for me?

791
01:06:51,069 --> 01:06:53,005
Look, if you help me find him,

792
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:55,733
I'll see what I can do
about getting you out of here.

793
01:06:57,232 --> 01:06:58,703
Please.

794
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,281
Single avowal or filed jointly.

795
01:07:21,939 --> 01:07:24,223
Hey, those paintings in your trailer,

796
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:26,731
- They're real, right?
- Yes.

797
01:07:27,092 --> 01:07:29,125
You didn't buy them
at auction. Did they?

798
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:31,524
They were a form of payment.

799
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,217
Right.

800
01:07:34,202 --> 01:07:35,717
Hey.

801
01:07:35,789 --> 01:07:37,382
Thank you.

802
01:07:40,506 --> 01:07:42,026
At my apartment.

803
01:07:42,051 --> 01:07:45,196
Oh
Yeah.

804
01:07:47,865 --> 01:07:49,974
Can we sit down for a second?

805
01:07:51,128 --> 01:07:53,912
Yeah.
Okay.

806
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:03,443
Just...

807
01:08:05,983 --> 01:08:07,726
have a sit.

808
01:08:22,587 --> 01:08:24,983
How do you...?

809
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:29,397
You know...
How to...?

810
01:08:30,253 --> 01:08:34,581
My father was an officer, in the Army.
Psychological operations.

811
01:08:34,614 --> 01:08:38,466
He was concerned I might be
taken advantage of somehow,

812
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:44,846
so he arranged for me to train with...
under a specialist, during my childhood.

813
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:48,093
We live in 34 homes in 17 years.

814
01:08:48,527 --> 01:08:51,277
- You moved 34 times?
- Mm.

815
01:08:51,952 --> 01:08:54,544
God, that's extraordinary.

816
01:08:56,482 --> 01:08:58,864
Now I'm sure it must
have been difficult.

817
01:08:59,384 --> 01:09:01,576
I've never been anywhere.

818
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:06,984
Only Cancun,
not my proudest moment.

819
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:08,752
Um.

820
01:09:09,695 --> 01:09:11,555
I just mean...

821
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:16,186
Your life is... unique.

822
01:09:16,211 --> 01:09:18,067
It's not unique, I have...

823
01:09:18,092 --> 01:09:21,036
high functioning form of autism
Which...

824
01:09:21,346 --> 01:09:23,238
means I have an
extremely narrow focus,

825
01:09:23,263 --> 01:09:26,346
and a hard time abandoning tasks
once I've taken them up.

826
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:31,041
I have difficulties socializing
with other people I don't know,

827
01:09:31,882 --> 01:09:33,821
but I want to.

828
01:09:39,677 --> 01:09:41,981
When I was a senior
in high school.

829
01:09:42,006 --> 01:09:44,612
I wanted this
special dress for prom.

830
01:09:44,637 --> 01:09:46,887
I told myself that spending
a hundred bucks on a trashy dress

831
01:09:46,912 --> 01:09:48,394
that I was going to wear
one time to an event

832
01:09:48,419 --> 01:09:49,801
that I thought was silly
in the first place,

833
01:09:49,826 --> 01:09:51,147
- it's just...
- Wasteful.

834
01:09:51,172 --> 01:09:52,590
Yes.

835
01:09:52,615 --> 01:09:57,211
But Vera Wang made this
black strapless classic,

836
01:09:57,236 --> 01:09:59,865
 it was more expensive but you could
wear it to all kinds of future events.

837
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:01,841
- It's an investment.
- Yes!

838
01:10:01,866 --> 01:10:03,940
Where were you when
I was in high school?

839
01:10:03,965 --> 01:10:06,526
Oh, North Carolina.
Israel.

840
01:10:07,925 --> 01:10:10,054
Right.
Um.

841
01:10:10,078 --> 01:10:12,267
The problem is. They wanted
$1700 dollars for this dress,

842
01:10:12,293 --> 01:10:13,508
and I didn't have that so...

843
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:15,693
- You asked your parents?
- No.

844
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:17,525
Hang on.

845
01:10:18,949 --> 01:10:21,884
Black Jack.
I never played a hand but I...

846
01:10:21,919 --> 01:10:24,336
went to the library and checked out
all these books on strategy.

847
01:10:24,361 --> 01:10:27,028
And I turned the Naperville North
math club into a little Vegas!

848
01:10:27,053 --> 01:10:29,669
- What's a "math club"?
- Math club.

849
01:10:30,299 --> 01:10:32,161
You compete against other schools.

850
01:10:32,196 --> 01:10:34,480
Theory and speed math.

851
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:40,034
Like what's 298,567 times 92.

852
01:10:40,059 --> 01:10:45,671
27,468,164.

853
01:10:48,951 --> 01:10:50,991
Right.
Um.

854
01:10:51,859 --> 01:10:53,415
Black Jack.

855
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,541
I could tell you when to hit,
stand, split, re-split,

856
01:10:56,566 --> 01:11:00,106
then moved on to card counting,
shuffle tracking, hole carding.

857
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:03,946
And I took everything I had,
which is $183 dollars,

858
01:11:03,971 --> 01:11:06,940
and I drove down to
Harrahs in Joliet.

859
01:11:06,965 --> 01:11:10,681
- Why was this dress so important to you?
- It wasn't about the dress.

860
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:17,136
I just wanted to walk into that gym
and have everybody say “Wow.”

861
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,808
I was trying to...

862
01:11:20,911 --> 01:11:24,438
Hold on.
I was trying to connect.

863
01:11:27,172 --> 01:11:30,787
I think no matter how different,
we're all trying to do the same thing.

864
01:11:33,991 --> 01:11:39,464
But I... I lost all but 20 bucks
in the first 10 minutes.

865
01:11:40,267 --> 01:11:44,981
Fed that into a nickel slot
on the way out and I won 2 grand.

866
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:47,834
I used the extra cash
to pay for a limo.

867
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,190
Only wore the dress
just the one time.

868
01:12:04,081 --> 01:12:06,197
Chris, why are we here?

869
01:12:07,438 --> 01:12:09,172
Um...

870
01:12:09,865 --> 01:12:12,707
I thought this hotel
had good water pressure.

871
01:12:12,732 --> 01:12:15,846
The Holiday Inn Express in Aurora
has good water pressure.

872
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:19,208
Yes, but these towels are very fancy.

873
01:12:19,985 --> 01:12:22,890
Cheaper hotels have scratchy towels.

874
01:12:24,152 --> 01:12:25,619
And...

875
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:28,721
I wanted you to like it.

876
01:12:45,696 --> 01:12:48,392
Crazy Eddie and the Panama Pump.

877
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:51,726
Crazy Eddie Antar and the Panama Pump.
Have you ever heard of it?

878
01:12:51,751 --> 01:12:53,058
What?

879
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:55,285
Crazy Eddie Antar!
He owned a...

880
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:58,487
a string of electronics stores
on New York City in the '80s.

881
01:12:58,512 --> 01:13:02,091
Crazy Eddie Antar, he started stealing
almost as soon as he opened his business.

882
01:13:02,116 --> 01:13:03,329
Okay, I'm not following.

883
01:13:03,354 --> 01:13:05,679
He deposited money in Tel Aviv,
then he cycled them

884
01:13:05,704 --> 01:13:07,833
through Panama and
bring back into his stores.

885
01:13:07,858 --> 01:13:09,969
Okay, why? Why take
it out and put it back?

886
01:13:09,994 --> 01:13:13,116
Well, initially he was just stealing and
garden-variety taxes evasion.

887
01:13:13,141 --> 01:13:15,563
But he came up
with a better idea.

888
01:13:15,588 --> 01:13:17,588
You see,
by taking his own money,

889
01:13:17,613 --> 01:13:20,361
stealing it and putting it
back on his books.

890
01:13:20,386 --> 01:13:21,794
It was raining cash.

891
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:24,004
He took the company public at
eight dollars a share.

892
01:13:24,029 --> 01:13:27,211
A year later it was
trading at seventy-five.

893
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,802
Rita's taking Living Robotics public.

894
01:13:30,827 --> 01:13:31,759
Yes.

895
01:13:31,784 --> 01:13:35,795
But why would she hire you in the first
place if she thought you'd figure it out?

896
01:13:36,984 --> 01:13:38,536
I don't know.

897
01:13:39,731 --> 01:13:41,698
I'll have to ask her.

898
01:13:44,196 --> 01:13:48,019
Whatever Rita's involve in,
it's not your concern.

899
01:13:48,402 --> 01:13:50,628
You disappear,
I make a call.

900
01:13:50,653 --> 01:13:52,771
Please.
I'm worried about you.

901
01:13:52,796 --> 01:13:55,221
If I don't do something,
Dana will die.

902
01:13:55,246 --> 01:13:57,943
Risking your life for a girl
you known a week.

903
01:13:57,968 --> 01:13:59,552
Why?

904
01:14:01,325 --> 01:14:04,344
Heavy sigh.
What's the plan?

905
01:14:04,369 --> 01:14:06,865
Find the person who
wants to kill her.

906
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:08,348
And?

907
01:14:08,669 --> 01:14:10,462
Shoot him in the head.

908
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:25,730
Last one.

909
01:16:26,274 --> 01:16:29,454
Two "FF"s.
Christian.

910
01:16:30,767 --> 01:16:33,410
245 men.

911
01:16:34,568 --> 01:16:37,390
Four with incomes over a million.

912
01:16:39,048 --> 01:16:41,851
All over the age of sixty.
Sorry.

913
01:16:41,876 --> 01:16:45,396
But...
your guy's an accountant.

914
01:16:46,103 --> 01:16:49,163
Two Christian Wolffs own CPA first .

915
01:16:49,406 --> 01:16:54,638
The first Christian Wolff,
owns Wolff Accounting,

916
01:16:54,663 --> 01:16:58,371
121 South Street,
Scottsdale, Arizona.

917
01:16:58,396 --> 01:17:03,027
Income of 435 grand.
It's a good year.

918
01:17:03,053 --> 01:17:06,227
So good, we audited
him 2 years ago.

919
01:17:06,252 --> 01:17:07,507
He's clean.

920
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:10,618
The other Christian Wolff.

921
01:17:11,953 --> 01:17:13,076
Nope.

922
01:17:13,101 --> 01:17:15,096
Only 75 grand.

923
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:19,800
ZZZ Accounting.

924
01:17:20,203 --> 01:17:24,105
Wabash Way, Plainfield, Illinois.

925
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:28,965
ZZZ, it's not exactly
a smart Yellow pages move.

926
01:17:32,883 --> 01:17:34,606
Wait a second.

927
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:40,838
Who filed the returns for Kim's nails,
Wabash Way, Plainfield

928
01:17:43,568 --> 01:17:45,326
ZZZ Accounting.

929
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:48,933
- Could just be the neighbor...
- Great Mandarin, Wabash.

930
01:17:51,809 --> 01:17:53,280
ZZZ Accounting.

931
01:17:53,305 --> 01:17:55,051
Paul's Laundromat.

932
01:17:58,368 --> 01:18:00,608
- ZZZ Accounting.
- ZZZ Accounting.

933
01:18:01,263 --> 01:18:04,259
Tell me they are all
registered as partnerships.

934
01:18:05,922 --> 01:18:07,461
Everyone.

935
01:18:07,486 --> 01:18:11,091
Managing partner: Christian Wolff.

936
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:21,571
- Christian Wolff.
- What?

937
01:18:21,598 --> 01:18:25,414
Christian Wolff, last year ran
$75,543 through his accounting firm...

938
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:27,750
Whoa.
Who is Christian Wolff?

939
01:18:27,775 --> 01:18:29,502
The accountant.

940
01:18:30,607 --> 01:18:31,751
Well...

941
01:18:31,776 --> 01:18:34,482
- 75 grand, that's chump change.
- Agreed, but...

942
01:18:34,507 --> 01:18:39,964
He ran another $287,765
through Kim's Nails,

943
01:18:39,989 --> 01:18:44,838
$445,112 trough Great Mandarin Chinese,
and you'll love this...

944
01:18:44,863 --> 01:18:49,995
$505,909 through Paul's Laundromat.

945
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:53,180
Paul's Laundromat?!
Are you fucking kidding me?

946
01:18:53,205 --> 01:18:54,246
He's playing with us.

947
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,752
He can't clean that kind of money
through an accounting firm.

948
01:18:56,777 --> 01:18:58,354
The paper trail's too heavy.

949
01:18:58,379 --> 01:19:00,221
So he's laundering it
through cash businesses.

950
01:19:00,246 --> 01:19:03,196
All of those were in the
same strip mall south of Chicago.

951
01:19:03,221 --> 01:19:04,306
ZZZ?

952
01:19:04,331 --> 01:19:06,970
I mean, he doesn't care about the traffic,
it's a front,

953
01:19:06,995 --> 01:19:11,323
All of it. “Christian Wolff,”
"Carl Gauss", “Lou ‘Lewis' Carroll.”

954
01:19:11,348 --> 01:19:15,128
He's using the names of famous
mathematicians as a cover.

955
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:22,422
Charitable Contributions here to
Harbor Neuroscience last year alone,

956
01:19:22,447 --> 01:19:25,210
- that's got to come to close to...
-  One million one hundred dollars.

957
01:19:25,235 --> 01:19:28,527
That one's not a cover.
That's the real deal, I've checked.

958
01:19:28,838 --> 01:19:31,989
So you're telling me this guy risks
his life doing forensic accounting

959
01:19:32,014 --> 01:19:34,779
for some of the scariest people
on the planet,

960
01:19:34,804 --> 01:19:37,276
collect his fee, goes to
all the trouble laundering it

961
01:19:37,301 --> 01:19:40,008
and then gives
almost all of it away.

962
01:19:41,016 --> 01:19:43,676
What if he's taking
other means of payment?

963
01:19:46,144 --> 01:19:48,216
Yeah.
Possible, yeah.

964
01:19:49,633 --> 01:19:51,488
I caught him, Ray.

965
01:19:51,776 --> 01:19:53,247
Maybe.

966
01:19:53,272 --> 01:19:55,754
Pack your bag.
We're going to Chicago.

967
01:21:08,225 --> 01:21:11,415
90% probability they are
all right-handed.

968
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,882
It was an accident.

969
01:21:14,133 --> 01:21:16,615
To me it's stand forth, right wrist.

970
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:20,406
Thought maybe you enjoy waiting
in the schoolyard sucker punch.

971
01:21:22,361 --> 01:21:26,198
Life is a series of choices,
none of which are new.

972
01:21:27,393 --> 01:21:31,179
The oldest is choosing
to be a victim

973
01:21:31,204 --> 01:21:33,544
or choose not to.

974
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,535
Second oldest, loyalty.

975
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,310
Family first, good times or bad.

976
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:49,293
Bonjour, fellows.

977
01:21:49,318 --> 01:21:52,349
- Yeah!
- Let's see what he's got, yeah.

978
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:54,646
They are new glasses.

979
01:21:56,402 --> 01:22:01,438
You think if... you don't fight back,
then maybe they'll like you?

980
01:22:02,174 --> 01:22:05,368
Stop picking on you,
calling you freak?

981
01:22:05,655 --> 01:22:07,317
Here's what it is.

982
01:22:07,342 --> 01:22:11,069
They don't like you,
they don't dislike you.

983
01:22:11,094 --> 01:22:14,545
They are afraid of you.
You're different.

984
01:22:15,465 --> 01:22:18,271
Sooner or later
different scares people.

985
01:22:22,672 --> 01:22:26,451
Victim or not?
Make your decision.

986
01:23:00,501 --> 01:23:01,953
Go.

987
01:23:16,265 --> 01:23:17,969
You're different.

988
01:23:22,177 --> 01:23:25,250
Sooner or later
different scares people.

989
01:24:30,257 --> 01:24:31,848
In here.

990
01:24:42,778 --> 01:24:45,475
.357 Colt Python.

991
01:24:45,673 --> 01:24:47,710
Serial number's gone.

992
01:24:48,846 --> 01:24:50,428
Hydra-Shok

993
01:25:02,164 --> 01:25:04,478
Wireless security cam.

994
01:25:04,959 --> 01:25:07,702
Infrared, weatherproof.

995
01:25:07,727 --> 01:25:09,558
He's got a network of them.

996
01:25:09,592 --> 01:25:12,289
The whole backyard he's got eyes.

997
01:25:18,764 --> 01:25:20,185
This is our guy.

998
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:23,500
So why is a guy who's up to
his elbows in cash live here?

999
01:25:23,525 --> 01:25:28,136
Given his clientele, he figures
blending in will extend his shelf life.

1000
01:25:28,531 --> 01:25:30,508
It's the smart move.

1001
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:34,007
Well, maybe not smart enough.

1002
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:37,585
I take security cameras back here.

1003
01:25:38,676 --> 01:25:41,068
Anybody can roll up
from the front.

1004
01:25:41,268 --> 01:25:43,370
How does he cover this?

1005
01:25:47,129 --> 01:25:49,749
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

1006
01:25:56,986 --> 01:25:58,992
Don't see that everyday.

1007
01:26:00,856 --> 01:26:04,186
Boys, let's have a situation report.

1008
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:06,016
Are we good, Ike?

1009
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,618
All clear.

1010
01:26:07,643 --> 01:26:09,174
Rock and roll.

1011
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:11,239
And how about you, sport?

1012
01:26:11,264 --> 01:26:13,023
It's Bobby.

1013
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:15,518
I got nothing.

1014
01:26:25,156 --> 01:26:27,124
Is all this really necessary?

1015
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:28,886
You should be
watching his home.

1016
01:26:28,911 --> 01:26:32,216
Yeah. That what you think?
That your idea of a subject.

1017
01:26:32,241 --> 01:26:35,021
I love it when people tell me
how to do my job.

1018
01:26:35,057 --> 01:26:37,200
I believe I recommended you
to leave the country.

1019
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:39,733
- You declined.
- He's an accountant!

1020
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,590
I could see it in his eyes.

1021
01:26:41,615 --> 01:26:44,030
The freak wasn't
going to let it go.

1022
01:26:47,715 --> 01:26:50,543
- Give my best to Michelle.
- I will.

1023
01:27:07,067 --> 01:27:09,811
I was old 10 years ago.

1024
01:27:12,828 --> 01:27:15,390
So what's your story, Medina?

1025
01:27:16,210 --> 01:27:17,844
You know my story.

1026
01:27:17,869 --> 01:27:20,013
I know what the Court said.

1027
01:27:22,897 --> 01:27:26,698
I stuffed a handful of cocaine
up a drug dealer's nose.

1028
01:27:26,723 --> 01:27:29,781
Pistol-whipped him
in the trunk of his car.

1029
01:27:30,543 --> 01:27:34,192
I was seventeen.
It was August.

1030
01:27:34,217 --> 01:27:37,885
He coked for three days,
but lived.

1031
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:39,749
Do you regret it?

1032
01:27:39,774 --> 01:27:42,744
The coke was half borax.

1033
01:27:42,769 --> 01:27:45,564
Same shit he kept
selling me sister.

1034
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:49,172
She's a dental hygienist
in Annapolis now.

1035
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:51,535
Married with 3 kids.

1036
01:27:55,109 --> 01:27:57,216
And, I don't regret it.

1037
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,520
That's rough.

1038
01:28:00,662 --> 01:28:02,976
All due respect, Director King,

1039
01:28:03,001 --> 01:28:05,958
what the fuck do you
know about Wolff?

1040
01:28:10,047 --> 01:28:13,174
- Wait, let me call it in!
- Move back!

1041
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:15,486
What don't you tell me, Medina?

1042
01:28:19,165 --> 01:28:20,554
Hey!

1043
01:28:20,579 --> 01:28:23,810
Men kill each other
for any number of reasons.

1044
01:28:24,851 --> 01:28:29,042
Money, power,
fear.

1045
01:28:29,067 --> 01:28:30,921
Right there, motherfucker!

1046
01:28:33,926 --> 01:28:36,897
9 men had died
that day at the Ravenite.

1047
01:28:37,958 --> 01:28:40,010
But for none of those reasons.

1048
01:28:42,518 --> 01:28:46,384
They had taken something from
the man who was killing them.

1049
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:50,444
Something that couldn't be
made whole again.

1050
01:28:51,836 --> 01:28:54,511
Something very important to him.

1051
01:28:55,868 --> 01:28:58,122
And he was there
for his pound of flesh.

1052
01:28:58,147 --> 01:28:59,303
Please.

1053
01:28:59,702 --> 01:29:01,448
Just fucking stop, man!

1054
01:29:01,473 --> 01:29:03,334
Put the gun down!

1055
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,740
"Little Tony" Bazzano.

1056
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:10,044
I'd been wasting
in a van for 6 months

1057
01:29:10,069 --> 01:29:14,018
listening to that arrogant little prick
belch, fart, and brag.

1058
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:19,353
I didn't recognize his voice
with all the fear in it.

1059
01:29:19,378 --> 01:29:22,322
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man.

1060
01:29:22,347 --> 01:29:23,642
I wasn't even...

1061
01:29:28,569 --> 01:29:31,272
Our man had come for revenge

1062
01:29:31,464 --> 01:29:33,211
and he got it.

1063
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,920
Nine dead.

1064
01:29:38,154 --> 01:29:40,073
And I was tenth.

1065
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,700
Your name?

1066
01:29:45,781 --> 01:29:47,111
Ray.

1067
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:50,001
Raymond King.

1068
01:29:50,026 --> 01:29:52,904
Who employs you, Raymond King?

1069
01:29:54,227 --> 01:29:56,223
I'm a Treasury Agent.

1070
01:29:57,434 --> 01:29:59,182
Are you a good one?

1071
01:30:01,609 --> 01:30:04,878
No.
No. Not particularly.

1072
01:30:06,675 --> 01:30:08,080
Is that it?

1073
01:30:09,449 --> 01:30:12,105
Kids. I got...
I'm a dad.

1074
01:30:12,130 --> 01:30:13,925
I got 2 kids.

1075
01:30:15,179 --> 01:30:16,648
Grown?

1076
01:30:18,967 --> 01:30:20,339
Yeah.

1077
01:30:20,829 --> 01:30:24,051
Yes. Yes.
They're all... They're all grown up.

1078
01:30:25,468 --> 01:30:28,481
Were you a good dad, Rayond King?

1079
01:30:31,708 --> 01:30:34,663
Yeah.
I've been a good dad.

1080
01:30:37,312 --> 01:30:41,332
I'm a lousy agent
and I've been a weak man,

1081
01:30:42,581 --> 01:30:45,106
but that...
that I didn't screw up.

1082
01:30:46,202 --> 01:30:48,085
That I got right.

1083
01:31:01,952 --> 01:31:04,877
Imagine you were a Treasury agent
approaching the twilight of a

1084
01:31:04,902 --> 01:31:07,882
spectacularly dismal career...

1085
01:31:09,227 --> 01:31:10,995
And then one day...

1086
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:13,836
that break you should've been
looking for...

1087
01:31:13,861 --> 01:31:17,087
Francis Silveberg, the black money legend,

1088
01:31:17,112 --> 01:31:21,530
who cleaned cash from
Monte Carlo to Havana to Vegas.

1089
01:31:21,858 --> 01:31:26,122
He kept the books for the
Gambino family for forty plus years.

1090
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:28,601
Until one day, the boss,
"Big Tony" Bazzano,

1091
01:31:28,626 --> 01:31:32,360
thought maybe the old man's age
made him vulnerable to prosecution.

1092
01:31:32,385 --> 01:31:35,675
Ordered his son, "Little Tony",
to kill Francis.

1093
01:31:36,003 --> 01:31:37,522
Kid fucked it up.

1094
01:31:37,547 --> 01:31:42,572
Francis ran, became a was a federal informant
in return for protective custody.

1095
01:31:42,597 --> 01:31:45,200
It could've turned my career around

1096
01:31:45,225 --> 01:31:47,202
only If I had listened.

1097
01:31:48,759 --> 01:31:50,226
I didn't.

1098
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:52,569
He was processed out.

1099
01:31:52,594 --> 01:31:54,719
And he lost the only
protection he had.

1100
01:31:54,744 --> 01:31:55,943
Please stand clear of the gate.

1101
01:31:55,968 --> 01:32:01,512
The protection that he was promised
when he testified against "Big Tony".

1102
01:32:04,084 --> 01:32:07,309
And this time,
"Little Tony" got it right.

1103
01:32:07,801 --> 01:32:10,440
He had Francis
in a couple of hours.

1104
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:15,334
down in a filthy basement in the Bronx,
nailed to a chair,

1105
01:32:16,743 --> 01:32:18,842
tortured to death.

1106
01:32:21,692 --> 01:32:26,473
So I...
volunteered for a joint task force,

1107
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:29,776
Sat outside the Ravenite
surveillance van for months

1108
01:32:29,801 --> 01:32:34,284
hoping to get a shred of evidence
to use against Francis's killers.

1109
01:32:36,701 --> 01:32:39,935
Wait, wait,
let me call it in!

1110
01:32:41,414 --> 01:32:42,135
Move back!

1111
01:32:42,173 --> 01:32:45,011
I went in there hoping
I could ease my guilt.

1112
01:32:47,036 --> 01:32:49,233
And I met our accountant.

1113
01:32:50,551 --> 01:32:53,595
Why he let me live,
I didn't know .

1114
01:32:54,678 --> 01:32:56,727
But he changed my life.

1115
01:32:59,763 --> 01:33:02,333
I gave my notice
to the department.

1116
01:33:02,757 --> 01:33:05,534
I started looking forward
to the day again.

1117
01:33:05,559 --> 01:33:08,443
You know,
feeling the sun on my face.

1118
01:33:08,895 --> 01:33:10,456
Quit drinking.

1119
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:13,227
I was on my way out the door...

1120
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:16,505
and then the phone rang.

1121
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:17,793
Ray King.

1122
01:33:17,818 --> 01:33:19,357
I'll never forget that voice.

1123
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,233
Do you like puzzles, Raymond King?

1124
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:27,001
She tells me she works
for the accountant.

1125
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:30,695
And that a shipping container
packed with Chinese nationals

1126
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:33,670
is passing through
the Port of New York.

1127
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:35,816
A few months later,

1128
01:33:35,841 --> 01:33:40,889
one ton of uncut Juarez Cartel product
is entering Miami.

1129
01:33:41,878 --> 01:33:44,741
All those cases you put together.

1130
01:33:45,987 --> 01:33:47,879
Smoke and mirrors.

1131
01:33:51,426 --> 01:33:54,341
So, who is he...

1132
01:33:54,366 --> 01:33:55,471
this “accountant”?

1133
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:59,343
Prisoner 831,
Fort Leavenworth maximum security.

1134
01:33:59,368 --> 01:34:01,370
Military prison?

1135
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:03,591
So he was in the army.

1136
01:34:04,243 --> 01:34:08,025
Army lent him to us to track
Al-Qaeda money launderers

1137
01:34:08,443 --> 01:34:12,769
He was transferred from Leavenworth
to our detention center in DC.

1138
01:34:13,567 --> 01:34:15,931
Did the work of five men.

1139
01:34:16,034 --> 01:34:19,613
Data Mining, Basket Analysis.

1140
01:34:20,796 --> 01:34:22,901
He roomed with Francis.

1141
01:34:22,926 --> 01:34:27,059
They kept to themselves.
Played chess. Ate together.

1142
01:34:27,084 --> 01:34:29,609
Sat in a TV room together.

1143
01:34:30,603 --> 01:34:32,631
They were inseparable.

1144
01:34:33,727 --> 01:34:36,041
And then one day, a guard
told Wolff why Francis

1145
01:34:36,066 --> 01:34:39,262
hadn't called or written
since he got out.

1146
01:34:39,693 --> 01:34:44,041
And his burned body had been found
on a Staten Island landfill.

1147
01:34:45,194 --> 01:34:48,691
Wolff snapped,
went after the guard.

1148
01:34:48,941 --> 01:34:52,398
He fractured the man's skull
with a thermos.

1149
01:34:52,686 --> 01:34:55,339
Escaped from a
third-floor window.

1150
01:34:56,075 --> 01:34:57,864
Took the thermos.

1151
01:34:58,102 --> 01:34:59,531
That's all you got?

1152
01:34:59,556 --> 01:35:02,702
- I mean, Leavenworth, they would have military...
- Records are all heavily redacted.

1153
01:35:02,727 --> 01:35:05,339
Well then, arrest records, something.

1154
01:35:05,685 --> 01:35:10,250
Spring of 2003, at a funeral home
in Kankakee, Illinois.

1155
01:35:11,087 --> 01:35:15,840
Our boy sent 6 locals to the hospital
with a variety of injuries.

1156
01:35:17,046 --> 01:35:19,071
No one knew Wolff.

1157
01:35:19,113 --> 01:35:24,254
The older man who came with him
was identified as a colonel, US Army.

1158
01:35:25,597 --> 01:35:27,371
Funeral home.

1159
01:35:27,652 --> 01:35:29,160
Whose wake?

1160
01:35:29,185 --> 01:35:31,431
One customer that day.

1161
01:35:34,595 --> 01:35:36,848
Mrs. Lauren Alton.

1162
01:35:38,927 --> 01:35:42,976
Mrs. Alton taught first grade
for 13 years in Kankakee.

1163
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:46,838
Survived by a husband
and two boys, ages 12 and 10.

1164
01:35:47,995 --> 01:35:51,619
By all accounts,
an ordinary life, well-lived

1165
01:35:51,722 --> 01:35:53,553
but cut short.

1166
01:35:57,728 --> 01:36:01,621
Excuse me, sir.
This is family only.

1167
01:36:01,851 --> 01:36:05,489
Sir, please come over.
I'll have to ask you to step outside.

1168
01:36:05,514 --> 01:36:09,956
And then a fight breaks out.
A brawl really.

1169
01:36:10,327 --> 01:36:13,895
Over what, the authorities never...
get down.

1170
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,946
Get your hands off me.

1171
01:36:18,911 --> 01:36:20,944
Deputies respond.

1172
01:36:21,292 --> 01:36:26,389
A barney fife type squares off
with our boy gets rattled, pulls his gun.

1173
01:36:26,617 --> 01:36:30,318
The colonel just stepped in front
of the 83 weapon.

1174
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:34,307
Army collected both men.

1175
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:37,911
Police report named
Wolff as "Soldier one".

1176
01:36:37,936 --> 01:36:41,310
The widower identified the colonel by name.

1177
01:36:41,335 --> 01:36:44,089
His late wife's former husband.

1178
01:36:44,249 --> 01:36:46,542
I've checked, it's an alias.

1179
01:36:46,682 --> 01:36:49,768
No more real than "Christian Wolff."

1180
01:36:52,661 --> 01:36:55,602
She was the dead colonel's ex-wife.

1181
01:36:58,075 --> 01:37:00,573
And you think
Wolff is what to him?

1182
01:37:07,295 --> 01:37:10,902
Were you a good dad?
Ray King?

1183
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:23,059
I've given up trying to figure out
when I'll get a call.

1184
01:37:23,084 --> 01:37:25,975
The why though,
that I got.

1185
01:37:26,945 --> 01:37:29,947
Someone breaks his moral code.

1186
01:37:40,288 --> 01:37:42,531
Why are you telling me this?

1187
01:37:42,556 --> 01:37:45,097
I'm retiring in a few months.

1188
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:48,503
When she calls...

1189
01:37:49,794 --> 01:37:52,347
somebody needs to be
there to answer.

1190
01:38:07,095 --> 01:38:08,420
No.

1191
01:38:11,685 --> 01:38:13,461
He's a criminal, Ray.

1192
01:38:13,486 --> 01:38:14,712
Yeah.

1193
01:38:14,737 --> 01:38:18,959
He aids and abets drug cartels,
money launderers.

1194
01:38:19,015 --> 01:38:21,039
He's a fucking killer.

1195
01:38:22,151 --> 01:38:24,957
Believe me, I've wrestled
with the same decision.

1196
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:29,056
But when I got
that first call,

1197
01:38:30,042 --> 01:38:32,469
I realized something.

1198
01:38:34,982 --> 01:38:40,815
I spent my whole life only recognizing
my lucky breaks after they were gone.

1199
01:38:47,864 --> 01:38:49,857
The Brit, who is she?

1200
01:39:03,277 --> 01:39:04,515
Hello?

1201
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:06,278
Miss. Medina,

1202
01:39:07,447 --> 01:39:10,270
tell Eliot Ness to get
his feet off the furniture.

1203
01:39:10,295 --> 01:39:12,512
He's not in a barn.

1204
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:18,161
Living Robotics.
Write it down.

1205
01:39:21,844 --> 01:39:24,661
More than 6 feet, short hair,
athletic build, yes?

1206
01:39:24,686 --> 01:39:25,703
Correct.

1207
01:39:25,728 --> 01:39:27,951
When you say short hair,
you mean short hair like my hair?

1208
01:39:27,976 --> 01:39:30,354
- Or you mean short hair like short hair?
- You... What's the difference?

1209
01:39:30,379 --> 01:39:32,113
I was told you could fix this,
so fix it!

1210
01:39:32,138 --> 01:39:34,713
But you did speak to the man, am I right?
You spoke to him.

1211
01:39:34,738 --> 01:39:35,944
What did he sound like?

1212
01:39:35,969 --> 01:39:39,580
We made small talk,
what's it matter what he sounds like?

1213
01:39:41,074 --> 01:39:43,630
That's Ike, right?
Is it north side?

1214
01:39:43,655 --> 01:39:45,637
Yo Bobby, was that you?

1215
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:49,566
Bob.

1216
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:54,939
Bobby.

1217
01:39:56,302 --> 01:39:58,276
Ike, are you there?

1218
01:39:59,059 --> 01:40:00,474
Ike?

1219
01:40:01,801 --> 01:40:04,513
Guys, stop fucking around, someone answer me.
Ike?

1220
01:40:04,538 --> 01:40:06,253
Course to the left.

1221
01:40:06,278 --> 01:40:10,163
You might consider using a round
with superior ballistic coefficient.

1222
01:40:12,806 --> 01:40:14,639
Give me the layout
of the home.

1223
01:40:14,664 --> 01:40:18,239
Points of entry,
corridors, rooms, cover.

1224
01:40:18,264 --> 01:40:19,645
Go.

1225
01:40:21,162 --> 01:40:22,599
Fuck!

1226
01:40:24,553 --> 01:40:25,571
Sit down.

1227
01:40:25,596 --> 01:40:28,419
- What's this all...?
- Shut up and sit down in the chair.

1228
01:40:54,782 --> 01:40:57,841
You ever see a magic green round
traveling 3000 feet per second

1229
01:40:57,866 --> 01:40:59,929
go through a window?

1230
01:41:01,964 --> 01:41:03,481
Nobody does.

1231
01:41:03,506 --> 01:41:05,218
Get down, now!

1232
01:41:41,895 --> 01:41:44,167
4 men, front entrance.

1233
01:41:44,475 --> 01:41:46,466
Go right at him, go now.

1234
01:41:52,205 --> 01:41:53,614
You,

1235
01:41:53,639 --> 01:41:57,115
I got the cameras.
Go join your friends.

1236
01:42:01,539 --> 01:42:02,886
Up!

1237
01:42:05,981 --> 01:42:07,385
Clear.

1238
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:21,525
Smoke.

1239
01:42:46,299 --> 01:42:47,741
Move!
Move!

1240
01:42:48,338 --> 01:42:49,657
Go!
Go!

1241
01:42:57,506 --> 01:42:58,768
Go!

1242
01:43:01,307 --> 01:43:03,083
Man down!

1243
01:43:05,194 --> 01:43:07,131
I'm at the front entrance,

1244
01:43:07,156 --> 01:43:08,927
pinned down!

1245
01:43:41,948 --> 01:43:43,739
Are they dead?

1246
01:43:48,187 --> 01:43:50,965
I need situation info.
How many down?

1247
01:43:51,379 --> 01:43:53,444
Are they dead?
Answer me!

1248
01:43:55,578 --> 01:43:58,153
Okay, he's on the roof.
Now, follow me, let's move.

1249
01:43:58,178 --> 01:44:00,002
Check the skylight.
Check the window.

1250
01:44:00,027 --> 01:44:02,058
When that motherfucker comes in,
I want to hear gun shots,

1251
01:44:02,083 --> 01:44:04,305
and I want to hear
"Target eliminated".

1252
01:44:14,847 --> 01:44:17,358
That's enough.
He's in the god damn house!

1253
01:44:17,383 --> 01:44:18,604
Get out there and end this!

1254
01:44:18,629 --> 01:44:21,977
Brax, give me a situation report.
Have you got eyes on anything?

1255
01:46:30,483 --> 01:46:31,899
What's happening?

1256
01:46:32,839 --> 01:46:34,382
Say something!

1257
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:54,505
Solomon Grundy,
Born on a Monday,

1258
01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:56,484
Christened on Tuesday,

1259
01:46:57,013 --> 01:46:58,949
Married on Wednesday,

1260
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:01,489
Took ill on Thursday,

1261
01:47:01,514 --> 01:47:03,389
Grew worse on Friday,

1262
01:47:04,519 --> 01:47:06,318
Died on Saturday,

1263
01:47:07,278 --> 01:47:09,039
Buried on Sunday,

1264
01:47:09,588 --> 01:47:13,342
That was the end,
Of Solomon Grundy.

1265
01:47:17,215 --> 01:47:19,156
WHAT IS THIS?

1266
01:47:40,363 --> 01:47:42,654
Hey! Hey!
Stand down!

1267
01:47:42,679 --> 01:47:44,185
Fuck off!

1268
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,602
Hello, Braxton.

1269
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:32,420
Don't...

1270
01:48:33,109 --> 01:48:34,999
Don't do that.

1271
01:48:38,146 --> 01:48:40,290
I've been looking for you for 10 years,
and you're going to come at me like

1272
01:48:40,315 --> 01:48:43,456
we just saw each other yesterday.
That's what you got to do?

1273
01:48:43,481 --> 01:48:47,383
But...this.
Well, I think...

1274
01:48:47,501 --> 01:48:51,149
Well, I think that you're going to be
happy to see me, I guess.

1275
01:48:52,638 --> 01:48:54,332
I am happy.

1276
01:48:59,653 --> 01:49:01,575
I need to finish.

1277
01:49:03,269 --> 01:49:04,584
You should go.

1278
01:49:04,609 --> 01:49:06,305
I should go?

1279
01:49:07,306 --> 01:49:11,425
Okay, I...
Okay, I'll just go.

1280
01:49:12,011 --> 01:49:14,304
But first I'm gonna
ask you a question.

1281
01:49:14,329 --> 01:49:16,616
You're going to
give me an answer.

1282
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:18,915
Why would you and Pop
go to that funeral?

1283
01:49:18,952 --> 01:49:22,537
She left us, did you not remember that?
Did you not remember that!

1284
01:49:30,605 --> 01:49:32,729
It's your fault that
Pop's dead, you hear me?

1285
01:49:32,754 --> 01:49:34,788
- It's your fault!
- I'm sorry, Braxton.

1286
01:49:34,813 --> 01:49:38,342
You're sorry?
Sorry doesn't cut it, you weird fuck!

1287
01:49:40,885 --> 01:49:42,211
Shit.

1288
01:50:00,246 --> 01:50:03,832
You don't give a shit about me.
You don't give a shit about me.

1289
01:50:10,369 --> 01:50:12,065
How about now?

1290
01:50:20,346 --> 01:50:22,330
Are you going to fight?

1291
01:50:24,526 --> 01:50:26,034
Fight!

1292
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:19,818
I'm sorry, Braxton.

1293
01:51:23,536 --> 01:51:25,645
You know, If you had to see her...

1294
01:51:27,273 --> 01:51:29,767
If that was something
that you had to do.

1295
01:51:30,866 --> 01:51:32,610
You call me.

1296
01:51:33,159 --> 01:51:34,403
I'm your brother.

1297
01:51:34,428 --> 01:51:36,459
I always have your back.

1298
01:51:37,029 --> 01:51:39,409
You don't call him,
you call me.

1299
01:51:46,009 --> 01:51:48,059
Did you even wonder
where I was?

1300
01:51:48,084 --> 01:51:50,025
I know where you were.

1301
01:51:50,761 --> 01:51:52,994
I just wanted you
to be safe.

1302
01:51:53,019 --> 01:51:55,178
Some of my clients are...

1303
01:51:55,443 --> 01:51:57,265
quite dangerous.

1304
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:03,675
I kind of consider
fairly dangerous myself.

1305
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:07,317
Well, you've made an improvement.

1306
01:52:15,561 --> 01:52:17,268
Shit, man.

1307
01:52:18,297 --> 01:52:20,246
You and me here,

1308
01:52:21,345 --> 01:52:23,556
- Yeah, it's...
- Well, statistically speaking...

1309
01:52:23,581 --> 01:52:26,001
Christ, man!
It's rhetorical.

1310
01:52:26,026 --> 01:52:27,693
I mean, really?

1311
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:30,634
I was just saying.

1312
01:52:34,613 --> 01:52:36,775
Not happy.

1313
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:40,526
Do you consider what you
do important, Mr. Wolff?

1314
01:52:40,551 --> 01:52:43,289
To someone other than yourself,
I mean.

1315
01:52:43,314 --> 01:52:45,901
What I do is.

1316
01:52:45,926 --> 01:52:49,990
Living Robotics public offering
would have been worth billions.

1317
01:52:50,049 --> 01:52:53,574
Money to be used for
neuroprosthetics, nanotechnology.

1318
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:55,095
You?

1319
01:52:56,335 --> 01:52:58,733
Why in god's name
did I ever hire you?

1320
01:52:58,758 --> 01:53:00,934
To leak-proof your books.

1321
01:53:01,109 --> 01:53:05,104
Dana found a mistake, and you wanted
to be sure it's safe to go public.

1322
01:53:05,655 --> 01:53:07,344
And now you want to kill her.

1323
01:53:07,346 --> 01:53:09,071
I'm fond of Dana.

1324
01:53:09,096 --> 01:53:11,822
But I restore lives, not Dana!
ME!

1325
01:53:11,847 --> 01:53:13,972
Men, women, children.
I give them hope.

1326
01:53:13,997 --> 01:53:15,904
Make them whole.

1327
01:53:15,929 --> 01:53:17,830
Do you even know
what that's like?

1328
01:53:17,855 --> 01:53:19,719
Yes, I do.

1329
01:53:33,439 --> 01:53:34,839
Sorry.

1330
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:40,278
I missed you.

1331
01:53:47,108 --> 01:53:49,307
I missed you too, Braxton.

1332
01:53:51,648 --> 01:53:54,405
I missed you too
because I love you.

1333
01:53:54,597 --> 01:53:56,435
You're my brother.

1334
01:53:58,767 --> 01:54:00,332
Maybe...

1335
01:54:00,695 --> 01:54:02,252
Would you want to...

1336
01:54:03,421 --> 01:54:05,665
Maybe I can see you
in a week?

1337
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:08,004
Name the place,
I'll be there.

1338
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:23,617
How will I find you?

1339
01:54:24,716 --> 01:54:26,400
You won't.

1340
01:54:26,764 --> 01:54:28,638
I'll find you.

1341
01:54:34,269 --> 01:54:35,625
Helen.

1342
01:54:36,899 --> 01:54:39,844
How do you responds to rumors
that some of the victims had wounds

1343
01:54:39,871 --> 01:54:42,259
consistent with anti-aircraft rounds?

1344
01:54:42,283 --> 01:54:44,985
I'd say the Chicago police department
has ample experience

1345
01:54:45,011 --> 01:54:47,741
solving all manner of homicides.

1346
01:54:50,970 --> 01:54:53,521
Sir, how are the conspiracy
and fraud charges related to

1347
01:54:53,546 --> 01:54:55,829
the deaths of Lamar Blackburn
and his sister, Rita?

1348
01:54:55,854 --> 01:54:58,694
This is a very fluid situation.

1349
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:02,398
With a lot of surprising revelations
over the last 48 hours.

1350
01:55:02,423 --> 01:55:06,611
Let me introduce you to the person
leading the investigation.

1351
01:55:07,179 --> 01:55:08,591
Agent Medina.

1352
01:55:08,616 --> 01:55:10,061
Agent Medina.

1353
01:55:19,995 --> 01:55:21,811
Good afternoon.

1354
01:55:24,816 --> 01:55:28,055
As much as I
like to take credit for this,

1355
01:55:29,205 --> 01:55:30,806
I can't.

1356
01:55:38,407 --> 01:55:41,198
Because this was...
a team effort,

1357
01:55:41,527 --> 01:55:46,247
comprised of long hours of good
old-fashioned investigative work.

1358
01:55:46,272 --> 01:55:47,533
Questions?

1359
01:55:47,558 --> 01:55:49,582
Can we get more information...

1360
01:55:51,975 --> 01:55:53,344
Harbor Neuroscience
Hanover, New Hampshire

1361
01:55:53,369 --> 01:55:57,070
He was just like our other two,
he was a happy baby.

1362
01:55:57,216 --> 01:56:01,362
Now, he rarely speaks.
It's like, our child is missing.

1363
01:56:01,387 --> 01:56:05,611
He's not there.
He's lost and he needs our help.

1364
01:56:06,592 --> 01:56:08,200
We thought...

1365
01:56:09,761 --> 01:56:14,352
We thought...
we hoped that he'd catch back up,

1366
01:56:14,859 --> 01:56:16,276
but he didn't.

1367
01:56:16,301 --> 01:56:21,564
1 in 68 children in this country are
diagnosed with a form of autism.

1368
01:56:21,702 --> 01:56:24,869
But if you can put aside for a moment
what your pediatrician

1369
01:56:24,894 --> 01:56:27,595
 and all the other NT's
have said about your son...

1370
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:28,922
“NT's”?

1371
01:56:28,947 --> 01:56:32,895
 “Neuro-typicals.”
 The rest of us.

1372
01:56:33,919 --> 01:56:35,786
What if we're wrong?

1373
01:56:36,154 --> 01:56:42,093
What if we've been using the wrong tests
to quantify intelligence in children with autism?

1374
01:56:43,451 --> 01:56:45,712
Your son's not less-than.

1375
01:56:46,404 --> 01:56:48,229
He's different.

1376
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:52,593
Now, your expectations for your son
may change over time,

1377
01:56:52,604 --> 01:56:57,751
they might include marriage,
children, self-sufficiency.

1378
01:56:57,776 --> 01:56:59,717
They might not.

1379
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:01,097
But I guarantee you.

1380
01:57:01,121 --> 01:57:03,907
If we let the world set
expectations for our children,

1381
01:57:03,932 --> 01:57:05,793
they'll start low

1382
01:57:06,949 --> 01:57:08,834
and they'll stay there.

1383
01:57:10,736 --> 01:57:14,267
Maybe your son is capable
of much more than you know.

1384
01:57:15,398 --> 01:57:19,022
And maybe...
Just maybe...

1385
01:57:19,492 --> 01:57:22,147
He doesn't understand
how to tell us.

1386
01:57:23,045 --> 01:57:24,538
Or...

1387
01:57:25,515 --> 01:57:28,109
we haven't yet
learned how to listen.

1388
01:57:53,805 --> 01:57:57,425
Hey, honey, for the hundredth time,
don't wonder off like that.

1389
01:57:57,467 --> 01:57:59,907
- I'm so sorry.
- It's alright. It's fine.

1390
01:57:59,932 --> 01:58:02,583
Can he visit with you
for a while, Justine?

1391
01:58:03,909 --> 01:58:04,924
Okay, good.

1392
01:58:04,949 --> 01:58:08,039
- C'mon, folks, I'll give you the nickel tour.
- You okay with that?

1393
01:58:08,064 --> 01:58:09,851
It's okay.
Come on.

1394
01:58:09,876 --> 01:58:11,865
Oh, he'll be fine.

1395
01:58:14,218 --> 01:58:16,722
Justine's one of our few
full-time residents.

1396
01:58:16,747 --> 01:58:19,131
She stopped talking 30 years ago,

1397
01:58:19,156 --> 01:58:22,267
communicates with a digital translator now.

1398
01:58:22,492 --> 01:58:24,692
Doctor, how is Harbor funded?

1399
01:58:24,717 --> 01:58:28,040
We are fortunate to have
very generous private donors.

1400
01:58:28,065 --> 01:58:31,000
- I'll say they're generous.
- Why is that?

1401
01:58:31,001 --> 01:58:34,092
- That woman, Justine.
- My daughter.

1402
01:58:34,117 --> 01:58:35,260
She's your daughter?

1403
01:58:35,285 --> 01:58:37,842
The reason I started the Institute.

1404
01:58:38,076 --> 01:58:42,978
Justine's computer, it's a BX-32.
Water-cool, 12 Core.

1405
01:58:43,013 --> 01:58:45,864
That's right, you're a software engineer.

1406
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:49,802
Well, some of our donors are
more generous than others.

1407
01:58:49,827 --> 01:58:52,327
Why?
Is that a good computer?

1408
01:58:52,352 --> 01:58:53,765
Good?

1409
01:58:54,124 --> 01:58:56,874
Doc, she could backdoor
the Pentagon with that rig.

1410
01:59:00,056 --> 01:59:03,479
Hello, Dreamboat.
Shall we chat?

1411
01:59:29,292 --> 01:59:30,689
- Hi.
- Hi.

1412
01:59:30,714 --> 01:59:32,250
Sign here, please.

1413
01:59:35,265 --> 01:59:36,658
Thank you.

1414
01:59:38,467 --> 01:59:40,285
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
