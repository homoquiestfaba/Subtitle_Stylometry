1
00:00:01,999 --> 00:00:05,122
Evidence of
a cataclysmic event...

2
00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:08,122
You can see
it here, that this event

3
00:00:08,122 --> 00:00:11,832
took place.
Written accounts

4
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:15,122
describing lost cities...
Atlantis

5
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:18,122
had a great advanced
civilization.

6
00:00:18,122 --> 00:00:21,290
And mythic tales
of gods punishing humanity...

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,999
They decided
that they would destroy all

8
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:27,122
these civilizations.
In ancient

9
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:29,290
cultures throughout
the world, there are numerous

10
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:34,122
stories of mankind nearly being
destroyed by a great flood.

11
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:39,122
But could such an event have
actually taken place?

12
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:43,122
And might it have been caused by
an otherworldly force?

13
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:45,624
One has to
ask the question: "What if Noah

14
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:49,122
was one of the
extraterrestrials?"

15
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:52,999
Millions of people
around the world believe

16
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:57,122
we have been visited in the past
by extraterrestrial beings.

17
00:00:57,122 --> 00:01:02,122
What if it were true?
Did ancient aliens really help

18
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:07,122
to shape our history?
And if so, might we find

19
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:10,624
evidence in the stories of
"The Great Flood"?

20
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:47,122
It is one of the
best-known stories of the Bible,

21
00:01:47,122 --> 00:01:51,122
and variations of this ancient
tale can be found in cultures

22
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:56,290
throughout the world.
From ancient Hindu teachings and

23
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:01,122
Mesopotamian legends to
Mesoamerican myths, it is

24
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:04,122
written that the gods sent a
powerful flood to wipe out all

25
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:08,832
of humanity...
God is angry at

26
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:12,122
human beings, because human
beings have not been behaving

27
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:16,122
properly; they have been
violating God's laws.

28
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:19,290
KATHLEEN McGOWAN COPPENS:
Certainly the most famous of

29
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,122
these is the legend of Noah.
In Genesis, God becomes so

30
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:27,122
disgusted with the behavior of
His creation that He says He

31
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:33,122
"repenteth of making them..."
...and He brings forth the

32
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:37,122
deluge.
In stories

33
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:41,122
much older than the story of
Noah, in the story of

34
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:44,122
Gilgamesh, the Sumerian legend,
the council of gods brought

35
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:49,122
the flood.
In Plato's writing,

36
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:52,290
Zeus brought the flood.
In

37
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,122
Hinduism, God had instructed
that, one day, the whole Earth

38
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:59,122
will be flooded.
When that happens, you build a

39
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:04,122
boat and you gather the people,
some animals, and then I will

40
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:11,290
save you.
The story of the

41
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,122
Great Flood is often considered
to be mythological.

42
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:19,122
But similar stories of a
cataclysmic flood can be found

43
00:03:19,122 --> 00:03:24,999
in approximately 1,200 different
cultures around the world,

44
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:28,290
and many anthropologists say
that because these stories are

45
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,122
so numerous and date back
thousands of years, it is

46
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:37,122
unlikely that they originated
from a single source.

47
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:40,122
When we find
similar myths all over the

48
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:43,123
world, like the myth of the
flood, then we have to ask

49
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:47,122
ourselves are these things that
human beings came up with

50
00:03:47,122 --> 00:03:51,999
independently, because let's say
there was a great flood in

51
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:55,122
ancient history, that has been
memorialized in people's

52
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:59,122
mythologies, because it was such
a cataclysmic event that people

53
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:04,122
looked for a religious
explanation for it.

54
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:07,832
The fact that
there are ancient stories that

55
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:12,122
speak of the same flood, it
almost leads into that

56
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:16,122
direction that, at some point,
some cataclysm happened that

57
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:21,122
not just affected one geographic
area of the world, but the

58
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:25,122
entire planet.
If a cataclysmic

59
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:29,832
flood really did occur, killing
most life on the planet,

60
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:33,122
what could have caused it?
And is there any

61
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:37,122
physical evidence to suggest
that it actually happened?

62
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:40,123
Scientists say answers to both
questions may be buried deep

63
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:50,122
beneath the sea.
The Indian Ocean.

64
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:53,122
According to the five scientists
who make up the Holocene Impact

65
00:04:53,122 --> 00:04:57,122
Working Group, this area--
900 miles southeast of

66
00:04:57,122 --> 00:05:01,122
Madagascar-is where an
enormous asteroid struck the

67
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:06,122
Earth, thousands of years ago.
This impact may have been so

68
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:10,123
large that it triggered enormous
tsunamis that flooded inland

69
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:14,999
areas across the region--
an event the local inhabitants

70
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:18,122
would have perceived as
a great flood.

71
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:20,999
Since so many
ancient cultures have a flood

72
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:25,122
story or a flood mythology,
this is probably based in some

73
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:29,122
sort of real event...
and an asteroid landing in

74
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:33,122
the ocean, in the right place,
triggering a tsunami, would then

75
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:36,122
lead to one of these
major floods.

76
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:39,122
The Holocene Group
says evidence for a

77
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:42,122
catastrophic asteroid strike
lies in what they believe is an

78
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:46,122
18-mile-wide crater on the
floor of the Indian Ocean,

79
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:50,122
just west of the island
of Madagascar.

80
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:53,122
Holocene Group scientists
believe further evidence

81
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:56,122
supporting their theory also
lies in what are called

82
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,122
"chevrons"-ancient deposits of
sediment and fossils in both

83
00:06:00,122 --> 00:06:06,122
Madagascar and Australia.
What was so out

84
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:10,122
of place and unusual about the
chevrons was that they

85
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:14,999
weren't land-based debris.
But, rather, it was the

86
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:19,122
kind of debris you get from an
ocean sea bottom, things like

87
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:24,122
marine animals, marine fossils.
They've also found what's really

88
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:29,122
the smoking gun of any asteroid
or comet impact, and that's

89
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:33,122
micro-beads.
The only way they are formed

90
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:37,122
is by the extreme heat of an
impact melting the rock,

91
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:40,123
the rock being thrown into
the air, or water, and cooling

92
00:06:40,123 --> 00:06:48,123
into these nice little spheres.
Similar marine

93
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:52,122
fossils have also been found on
the other side of the world,

94
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:56,122
at the ancient temple
complex of Puma Punku,

95
00:06:56,122 --> 00:07:02,122
in modern-day Bolivia.
If the Holocene Group's initial

96
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:06,122
findings prove true, they could
be definitive evidence that

97
00:07:06,122 --> 00:07:09,999
a cosmic strike caused
large-scale flooding thousands

98
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:15,122
of years ago.
But if an asteroid really was

99
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:20,122
responsible for a worldwide
flood, scientists say it would

100
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:23,122
have to have been as large as
the one that led to the

101
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:27,122
extinction of the dinosaurs,
which measured eight miles

102
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:31,122
wide and struck the Earth with a
force five billion times more

103
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:35,457
powerful than the bomb dropped
on Hiroshima.

104
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:43,832
There are many
ancient texts that tell us

105
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:48,122
that there wasn't just a flood,
but there was also a

106
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:53,122
conflagration, a period of fire,
when the Earth was bombarded

107
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:56,122
with firestorms, the gods
bringing them down, and that

108
00:07:56,122 --> 00:08:01,122
this period was then
followed by a flood.

109
00:08:01,122 --> 00:08:04,122
And it would seem that
fragments of this comet

110
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:08,122
vaporized the ice sheets that
had been covering large parts

111
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:12,832
of the northern hemisphere for
tens of thousands of years,

112
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:16,122
sending all of the water up
into the atmosphere,

113
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:20,122
which then rained down.
Perhaps even for 40 days,

114
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:23,122
40 nights, like the Bible
tells us.

115
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:29,122
According to those
scientists who subscribe to this

116
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:32,624
theory, the fires that might
have occurred just before the

117
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:36,122
flood would have left behind an
ash layer in the Earth, all over

118
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:40,290
the world.
This distinctive ash layer--

119
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,122
which scientists call the
Usselo Horizon-could be the

120
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:48,122
ultimate proof that the Great
Flood really occurred.

121
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:53,122
And researchers believe they may
have discovered it.

122
00:08:56,122 --> 00:09:00,122
Just outside the small Belgian
town of Lommel, author and

123
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:05,122
researcher Andrew Collins
follows local archeologist

124
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:09,122
Ferdi Geerts to the site of a
mysterious black layer of soil

125
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:14,122
excavated by a mining company.
I can already see a

126
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:18,122
black layer, um, in the soil
here.

127
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:22,122
It's about just under a-a meter
down, um, three to four feet,

128
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:29,624
um, and, um, are we looking here
at the Usselo Horizon?

129
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:31,290
Yes.
Is this, is this it?

130
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,122
At the end of the
ditch we see, uh, a peat layer.

131
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:36,122
Yeah.
At the top of the

132
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:38,122
peat layer, there is, uh, some
charcoal.

133
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:41,122
Right. So, can-can
we go down and look at this?

134
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:45,122
Yes.
Collins and Geerts

135
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:49,122
get a closer look, which allows
them to determine that this dark

136
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:53,123
layer of soil seems to date to
the end of the last ice age,

137
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:56,122
about the same time the Usselo
Horizon is supposed to have

138
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:59,290
formed.
If we come down from

139
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,999
the, from the-the surface here,
which is obviously the modern

140
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:07,122
day, there is this accumulation
of sand over a period of around

141
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:12,122
13,000 years, that takes us back
to this point here.

142
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:14,122
The black is a layer,
eh?

143
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:16,999
Yeah.
And the-the white is

144
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:19,122
sand.
We call that a soil horizon.

145
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:21,999
Yeah. Okay.
According to

146
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:25,999
Geerts, this black layer dates
back to the time period when a

147
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:29,122
global flood may have devastated
Earth.

148
00:10:29,122 --> 00:10:33,122
But what is it made of?
Collins and Geerts dig into the

149
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:38,122
soil and discover that it is,
indeed, charcoal.

150
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:43,122
This is the Usselo Horizon, and
to Collins, it's confirmation

151
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:46,999
that the catastrophe described
in the Bible was real.

152
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:52,290
This is physical
evidence of that flood,

153
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:58,624
of that conflagration.
This is your absolute evidence

154
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:02,999
that this event took place.
This is the evidence of the

155
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:07,122
cataclysm.
Could the Usselo

156
00:11:07,122 --> 00:11:12,122
Horizon, a possible impact
crater in the Indian Ocean and

157
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:17,122
sea fossils at Puma Punku all be
proof that the ancient story

158
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:21,122
of a great flood is not a myth,
but that it is based on actual

159
00:11:21,122 --> 00:11:26,122
events?
And if so, could the rest of the

160
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:30,122
story, in which God sent a
flood to annihilate the human

161
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:35,122
race, be true as well?
This suggests

162
00:11:35,122 --> 00:11:39,290
that a great flood did, in fact,
happen; that it was real.

163
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,122
But then it also presents us
with an intriguing possibility.

164
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:49,122
It is entirely possible that
there is an extraterrestrial

165
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:57,122
origin to this terrible flood.
Could it be that

166
00:11:57,122 --> 00:12:01,122
the Great Flood described in so
many ancient texts really did

167
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:05,122
occur at the end of the last
Ice Age?

168
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:08,122
And if so, could it have been
brought on by extraterrestrial

169
00:12:08,122 --> 00:12:12,122
beings?
Ancient astronaut theorists say

170
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:17,122
yes, and claim that evidence of
this can be found at the top of

171
00:12:17,122 --> 00:12:21,122
one of the world's most sacred
mountains.

172
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:33,122
Laurel, Maryland.
October 2014.

173
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:38,122
At Johns Hopkins University,
top scientists from all over the

174
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:42,999
world gather for the first
International Asteroid Impact

175
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:47,999
Deflection Assessment Workshop.
The focus of this event is to

176
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,624
demonstrate the latest
technology designed for

177
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:55,122
diverting the course of
asteroids headed for a collision

178
00:12:55,122 --> 00:13:01,122
with Earth.
The proposed method involves

179
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:05,122
launching a spacecraft to
collide with the asteroid at a

180
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:09,122
velocity nine times faster than
the speed of a bullet fired from

181
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:17,122
an AK-47.
If we look at

182
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:20,122
the dinosaurs, for example,
65 million years ago-they were

183
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:26,999
wiped out due to the impact of a
giant rock that wiped out

184
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:31,122
everything on planet Earth at
the time.

185
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:37,122
And so, right now, scientists
around the globe are working

186
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:42,841
tirelessly to redirect asteroids
from possible collisions with Earth.

187
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:45,999
In addition to

188
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:49,624
using direct impact to knock an
asteroid off course, scientists

189
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:54,122
have also looked into the
possibility of creating a

190
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:57,624
gravity tractor that could
actually manipulate the

191
00:13:57,624 --> 00:14:02,624
trajectory of the object.
But if we are close to

192
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:06,122
developing this kind of
technology today, is it possible

193
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:10,122
that extraterrestrials who
visited Earth in the distant

194
00:14:10,122 --> 00:14:15,122
past already possessed the
ability to redirect asteroids?

195
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:19,999
And if so, might they have used
this technology not to deflect

196
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:25,624
an asteroid away from Earth...
but towards it?

197
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:29,122
We are talking
about technology that equals

198
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:34,624
ours today, or as some have
said, that it actually surpasses

199
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:39,122
whatever it is that we've
achieved so far in our modern

200
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:44,122
age.
And so, if we can control

201
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:48,122
the trajectories of asteroids,
to direct them away from Earth,

202
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:52,122
then it's certainly possible
that highly advanced

203
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:56,122
extraterrestrials could have had
the technology to direct an

204
00:14:56,122 --> 00:15:00,122
asteroid towards Earth.
It's

205
00:15:00,122 --> 00:15:03,122
interesting how the legends
described how the flood came.

206
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:08,122
It is stated that a great meteor
or comet or something was to

207
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:11,999
swing around from behind the
sun, and as such, rip the oceans

208
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:19,122
out of their bodies.
The flood was clearly contrived.

209
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:27,122
It was sent by higher powers to
correct things here on Earth.

210
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:31,122
They had an intent and a purpose
for Experiment Earth, which they

211
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:35,122
believe had become corrupted,
and therefore the flood was sent

212
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:41,457
as an attack, an assault upon
humanity.

213
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:47,999
If the Great Flood
was a real, historical event,

214
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:51,624
could it have been deliberately
caused by otherworldly beings

215
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:55,122
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest?

216
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:59,122
But if so, why?
What might they have been trying

217
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:08,122
to destroy?
Mount Hermon, Lebanon.

218
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:13,999
1869.
Exploring the top of this

219
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:18,122
historic mountain range, British
archeologist General Sir Charles

220
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:23,122
Warren discovers the sacred
temple of Qasr Antar-believed

221
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:29,122
to be the highest place of
worship in the biblical world.

222
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:33,122
Sir Charles
Warren hiked up to the top of

223
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:35,122
Mount Hermon.
The ruins of this temple are

224
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:37,624
there.
And there he found an ancient

225
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:42,122
stele and he broke this stele
into two pieces and brought it

226
00:16:42,122 --> 00:16:47,624
back to the British Museum.
When scholars

227
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:51,624
translated the Greek text, it
read: "According to the command

228
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:56,122
of the greatest and holy God,
those who take an oath proceed

229
00:16:56,122 --> 00:16:59,122
from here."
The inscription's significance

230
00:16:59,122 --> 00:17:03,122
was lost on archeologists for
more than a century, until

231
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,122
biblical scholar George
Nicklesburg connected it to an

232
00:17:07,122 --> 00:17:10,624
oath mentioned in the ancient
Book of Enoch.

233
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:15,122
According to Enoch, Mount Hermon
is where a band of renegade

234
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:18,999
angels known as the Watchers
descended from the heavens in

235
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:24,122
the distant past and took an
oath before meeting with humans.

236
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:28,122
In the time before
time, the sons of God came down

237
00:17:28,122 --> 00:17:31,122
to Earth.
They were the shining ones, the

238
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:36,122
Enohim, or fallen angels.
And they found the women very

239
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:40,122
attractive and they married the
women or bonded with the women.

240
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:43,999
The offspring of
these unnatural unions between

241
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:48,122
angels and humans were said to
produce giant hybrid beings

242
00:17:48,122 --> 00:17:55,122
called the Nephilim, and God was
so disgusted by their existence

243
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:58,122
that he decided to send a great
flood to cleanse the Earth of

244
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:04,624
them.
But how is it that human women

245
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:08,624
were able to be impregnated by
angels?

246
00:18:08,624 --> 00:18:12,122
Could it be, as ancient
astronaut theorists suggest,

247
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:16,122
that the Book of Enoch is not
actually describing angels, but

248
00:18:16,122 --> 00:18:21,122
rather a different kind of
otherworldly being?

249
00:18:21,122 --> 00:18:23,624
You've got to
wonder what was really going on

250
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:26,624
here?
Are extraterrestrials coming

251
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:32,122
and now breeding with humans,
which was somehow forbidden and

252
00:18:32,122 --> 00:18:36,122
wrong, but they did it anyway?
So the other extraterrestrials

253
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:44,100
decided, "This is a big mistake. Now
we've got to destroy all these people."

254
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,558
Could the story of

255
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:56,624
the Great Flood actually be
describing extraterrestrials

256
00:18:56,624 --> 00:19:00,122
coming to Earth long ago, and
interbreeding with human women

257
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:04,122
to create a mutant race of
giants?

258
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:09,122
Ancient astronaut theorists say
yes, and claim further evidence

259
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:13,624
can be found by examining ruins
that are believed to date back

260
00:19:13,624 --> 00:19:19,122
thousands of years before our
earliest known civilizations.

261
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:29,373
The Gulf of
Khambhat, India. 2001.

262
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:33,999
Scientists working some 25 miles

263
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:38,831
from shore, and 125 feet below
the surface, stumble across

264
00:19:38,831 --> 00:19:43,333
something extraordinary: what
appears to be the signs of an

265
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:47,333
ancient civilization.
Recently,

266
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:51,831
the marine archeologists of
India have discovered two cities

267
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:54,831
in the Bay of Khambhat.
They are still working on it,

268
00:19:54,831 --> 00:19:58,831
uh, you know, going down there
and archiving it and taking

269
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:02,831
photographs and videos.
They think that

270
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:06,541
these cities were destroyed in
a geological change that

271
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,831
happened many thousands of years
ago.

272
00:20:09,831 --> 00:20:13,333
But you have to wonder,
yourself, if there are not more

273
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:18,831
sunken cities all around India.
Their own legends and myths say

274
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:22,831
exactly that.
The ruins found

275
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:26,831
beneath the ocean in the Gulf
of Khambhat are thought to date

276
00:20:26,831 --> 00:20:31,831
back at least 9,000 years, to
the time when some researchers

277
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:39,708
believe a comet struck the Earth
and caused a global deluge.

278
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:48,831
Could these submerged cities not
only be evidence that the Great

279
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:53,831
Flood really did occur, but also
that it wiped out an advanced

280
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:57,831
society that existed long before
the earliest known human

281
00:20:57,831 --> 00:21:01,541
civilization?
Scientists say further evidence

282
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:05,831
can be found in archeological
sites around the world that date

283
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:12,831
back to end of the last ice age.
In southeastern Turkey lies

284
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,831
Gobekli Tepe, an extraordinary
series of circular stone

285
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:20,541
structures with intricately
carved pillars weighing as much

286
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:24,831
as 50 tons.
Radiocarbon dating indicates

287
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:29,708
parts of the complex were built
about 10,000 BC, and at least

288
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,831
one archeologist believes there
are signs it may have been

289
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:42,831
destroyed by a flood.
We have

290
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:46,708
evidence there of catastrophic
destruction; of pillars being

291
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:51,333
knocked over at the end of the
last ice age; that things were

292
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:55,708
very severe, people were trying
to rebuild it at the time.

293
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,999
Eventually, they effectively
gave up and covered over the

294
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:02,831
entire site, maybe to come back
later to uncover it, maybe to

295
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:08,999
simply bury it for posterity.
In the rain forests

296
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:14,831
of Indonesia is a series of
terraces, walls and steps on a

297
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:18,831
hill that the locals call Gunung
Padang.

298
00:22:18,831 --> 00:22:21,831
When scientists drilled into the
Earth to determine its age, they

299
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:26,831
discovered the site dates back
to at least 9700 BC.

300
00:22:28,831 --> 00:22:32,831
Very interestingly,
one of the layers of Gunung

301
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:36,831
Padang that's been exposed
seismically shows that there was

302
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:42,831
an entrance to a cave at about
9700 or so BC that was

303
00:22:42,831 --> 00:22:48,831
subsequently covered over.
Again, I think this ties in with

304
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:54,831
the events at the end of the
last ice age.

305
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:58,832
People were going into caves,
they had to escape, and then

306
00:22:58,832 --> 00:23:02,831
things were covered over after
that.

307
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:06,831
Are these ruins
that are found across the world

308
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:10,831
evidence of an advanced
civilization that existed before

309
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:15,831
a global deluge?
And if so, might we find mention

310
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:20,708
of it in ancient myths?
If we go back to

311
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:25,708
ancient Greece, one of the
myths, one of the sacred

312
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:29,831
narratives that Plato preserves
is the narrative that there used

313
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:34,708
to be a great continent, which
he calls Atlantis.

314
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:39,831
And Atlantis had a great,
advanced civilization.

315
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:45,708
Atlantis was one of the
continents that was destroyed by

316
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,831
the Great Flood.
When does he date

317
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:52,999
Atlantis?
To 9600 BC, which is very close

318
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:57,541
to the modern date of the end of
the last ice age.

319
00:23:57,541 --> 00:24:00,832
So all this, I believe, ties
together that we had an earlier

320
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:04,831
cycle of civilization.
It was devastated at the end of

321
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:08,541
the last ice age by natural
catastrophes.

322
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:12,831
Humanity was driven into a dark
age that lasted thousands and

323
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:16,831
thousands of years, until
civilization reemerged about

324
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:21,831
5,000 years ago.
Is it possible that

325
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:25,831
the story of Atlantis is really
describing a civilization that

326
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:29,831
existed before 10,000 BC, when
the Great Flood and the end of

327
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:32,999
the ice age are said to have
happened?

328
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:37,708
Did Atlantis suffer the same
fate as Gobekli Tepe, Gunung

329
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:41,831
Padang and many other ancient
structures that appear to have

330
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:45,708
been hit by some catastrophic
event?

331
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:50,541
Ancient astronaut theorists say
yes, and suggest that the most

332
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:55,333
compelling evidence can be found
not with what was destroyed,

333
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:58,625
but with what survived.

334
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:07,999
Qumran, Palestine.

335
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:12,999
1946.
In the desert, ten miles east of

336
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:17,999
Jerusalem, a Bedouin shepherd
leaves his flock of sheep and

337
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:23,334
goats to look for a stray.
Walking along the cliffs, the

338
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:26,999
shepherd spots a cave in
the distance.

339
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:30,999
He threw
a stone into a cave and

340
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:34,999
he heard the crack of breaking
pottery...

341
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:38,999
so he went in to investigate,
and found jars that contained

342
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:44,999
ancient manuscripts.
McGOWAN COPPENS: The Bedouin

343
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:47,999
shepherd's find led to a
discovery of 11 caves

344
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:50,999
that contained the most
extraordinary cache of

345
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:55,999
literature, arguably, in human
history-the Dead Sea Scrolls.

346
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:58,999
There are 800 pieces of
literature found in these

347
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:05,167
11 caves and it tells us so much
about the ancient world.

348
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:08,999
One of the amazing revelations
is the story about Noah that we

349
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:13,999
don't see in the Old Testament,
and the story is that when Noah

350
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:18,999
is born, he's an extraordinary
baby with a strange complexion

351
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:22,709
and the ability to light up
the room with his eyes.

352
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:24,999
What's
interesting is that you

353
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:28,999
actually have Noah's father,
Lamech, questioning whether or

354
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:36,999
not Noah is his son.
And this is due to the fact that

355
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:40,999
we have this story about these
fallen angels that came down and

356
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:46,999
had sex with women.
Lamech confronts his wife,

357
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:51,999
Batenosh, "Is it my son or is
it, is it one of theirs?"

358
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:55,999
Noah's exterior
is described as very foreign.

359
00:26:55,999 --> 00:27:01,999
His eyes are described to be
glowing like sunbeams; his skin

360
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:06,999
is glowing, as well.
Now that's a very bizarre

361
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:11,999
description, and so, one has to
ask the question: "What if

362
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:16,999
Noah was one of the
extraterrestrials?"

363
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:20,999
Could it be, as
ancient astronaut theorists

364
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:23,999
suggest, that the Biblical
figure of Noah was, in fact,

365
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:28,999
an alien being?
Is this the reason he is

366
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:34,999
described as having a strange
complexion and glowing eyes?

367
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:37,999
The key thing
that's going on with Noah is

368
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:41,999
that he is pure in God's sight,
and so is his family.

369
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:44,999
And this purity seems to
be genetic, as much as what you

370
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:49,999
might call spiritual.
And so, when God makes plans to

371
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:53,999
wipe out the rest of humanity,
what he's wiping out is the

372
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:58,000
extraterrestrial dimension of
humanity that has come about

373
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,999
through the pollution of human
genetics.

374
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:06,999
Could
extraterrestrials have sent

375
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:11,334
the Great Flood to cleanse
the Earth of genetic mistakes,

376
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:14,999
and make Noah the father of a
new version of humankind?

377
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:20,999
According to ancient stories,
the world that Noah's

378
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:24,000
descendants were born into was
very different from the one that

379
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,999
existed in pre-flood times,
when gods, giants, fairies, and

380
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:34,999
other creatures were said to
share the planet with humans.

381
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:38,999
The flood does seem
to serve as a demarcation point.

382
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:44,999
In the Bible, we read about how,
before the flood, people had

383
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:48,999
longer lives, but then, after
the flood, shorter lives.

384
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:51,999
We see the same thing in
Mesopotamian tradition,

385
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:55,999
with the Sumerian King List,
where, before the flood, we have

386
00:28:55,999 --> 00:29:00,999
kings that ruled in Mesopotamia,
with extraordinarily long lives.

387
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:04,999
After the flood, the lengths of
reigns of these kings becomes

388
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:08,167
much shorter.
The other thing that

389
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:10,876
happened before this
Great Demarcation is that the

390
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:13,999
gods were present among us.
There was a close interaction

391
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:16,709
between the human and
the sacred.

392
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:19,709
The gods would guide us and
they would be tempted.

393
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:22,709
There would be interaction,
the god might marry a mortal

394
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,999
and then there would be
descendants of the gods.

395
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:28,999
Now the gods seem so far away.
So, there are these theories

396
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:32,709
that this was the big shifting
point in human history.

397
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:34,999
It is really
interesting to note that the

398
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:37,709
interaction with these higher
beings seems to only be located

399
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,999
in the past.
All these depictions of "there

400
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:43,999
were giants upon the Earth."
Or a time when man interacted

401
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:46,999
with the gods.
Where are the gods today?

402
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:50,999
We only seem to have subtle
interactions.

403
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,999
It's curious to
think why that might have been.

404
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:57,709
What was it about this
Great Flood, this dividing line

405
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:02,334
in history, that caused the
separation of god and man?

406
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:08,999
It could be that our evolution
depended upon a natural

407
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:12,999
upbringing, an upbringing that
was not contaminated by this

408
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:16,999
notion that we're not alone in
the universe.

409
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:20,999
It could be a necessary part of
the human development.

410
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:31,999
Uzengili, Turkey.
1997.

411
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,999
More than 7,000 feet up,
near the country's eastern

412
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:39,876
border, an American explorer
searching for Noah's Ark, named

413
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:43,999
David Allen Deal, stumbles upon
the ruins of an ancient

414
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:47,876
settlement.
McGOWAN COPPENS: There is an

415
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:49,999
extraordinary archaeological
site in the Anatolian plateau,

416
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:55,999
in Turkey, called Naxuan, and
Naxuan comes from an ancient

417
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:59,999
word that means "Noah's Zion,"
the city of God that Noah built.

418
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:05,999
Mount Ararat, which is the
legendary resting place of

419
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:09,999
Noah's Ark, is very close by,
so it makes a lot of sense

420
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:12,999
that this could have been
the landing site of the ark and

421
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:15,999
then this city would have been
built by Noah.

422
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:21,999
The ancient
Armenian historian Moses of

423
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:25,999
Choren called Naxuan,
"the place of first descent

424
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:28,999
where Noah and his family
emerged from the ark and built

425
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:32,999
the first city or town after
the flood."

426
00:31:35,876 --> 00:31:37,999
Could this be the first
settlement in the post-flood

427
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:41,999
world, the place where Noah
lived and died?

428
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:47,999
Today, this remote area is
largely uninhabited, but

429
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:52,876
according to explorer David
Deal, a recent archeological dig

430
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:56,999
reportedly uncovered something
remarkable:

431
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:01,999
the region may contain as many
as a million graves.

432
00:32:03,876 --> 00:32:05,876
McGOWAN COPPENS: There is
evidence that people came

433
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:07,999
from all over the world
to bury their dead here,

434
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:13,999
for 10,000 years.
The idea is that if you are

435
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:17,999
brought here to be buried in
the site of this extraordinary

436
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:22,876
prophet, this man who was chosen
by God to be the survivor of the

437
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:25,999
deluge, that you, too, would be
resurrected because you were in

438
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:28,399
such holy company.

439
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:34,499
According to some
researchers, if this is indeed

440
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:38,499
the place where Noah began the
repopulation of the Earth, then

441
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:43,499
the Ark must be nearby as well.
In the Book of

442
00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:48,499
Genesis, we read about how God
commanded Noah to build an ark.

443
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:52,499
And the measurements of this ark
are quite large.

444
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:57,499
The dimensions usually given are
about 450 feet long by 75 feet

445
00:32:57,499 --> 00:33:03,499
wide by about 45 feet high.
Such a boat of these dimensions

446
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:08,499
was never seen in the ancient
world, and in fact, not until

447
00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:13,499
the 19th century was there ever
a boat of this size.

448
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:18,499
In 2009, a Dutchman
named Johan Huibers started

449
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:22,376
building a full-size version of
Noah's ark using the

450
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:24,499
instructions laid out in the
Bible.

451
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:28,499
It took him three years and more
than a million dollars

452
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:32,499
to complete the project.
But while the ship seems

453
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:36,499
perfectly designed to ride out a
torrential storm, many say it's

454
00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:41,499
still far too small to literally
hold two of every animal species

455
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:46,499
on the planet.
It would seem pretty

456
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:50,499
clear that Noah did not scoop up
every form of life on Earth and

457
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:55,499
put it into the Ark.
And so as a means of saving all

458
00:33:55,499 --> 00:34:02,499
life-forms on Earth, uh, this is
not possible, not believable.

459
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,499
But ancient
astronaut theorists suggest

460
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:08,499
there might be another way in
which the ark was able to

461
00:34:08,499 --> 00:34:11,499
preserve two of every creature
on Earth, as stated in the

462
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:15,499
Bible.
Let's look at it

463
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:18,499
from a technological
perspective.

464
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:24,376
The only way that you can create
an ark like Noah created,

465
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:28,499
according to what we can read in
the Old Testament, is if you

466
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:35,499
collect DNA samples.
So, what if the ark was a

467
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:41,499
metaphor or a symbol for some
type of a DNA bank?

468
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:44,499
Did the ark
described in the story of Noah

469
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:49,376
really exist?
And if so, might it have been

470
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:52,499
not a vessel to carry two of
every animal species, but a DNA

471
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:58,499
bank, built to hold the genetic
information of all life on our planet?

472
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:01,499
What one might

473
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:07,499
read into this is that some kind
of special DNA bank was to be

474
00:35:07,499 --> 00:35:15,376
created; that animal DNA, plant
DNA, and human DNA for that

475
00:35:15,376 --> 00:35:20,376
matter, were all to be
preserved somehow in an ark that

476
00:35:20,376 --> 00:35:26,499
was to float through the flood
and this catastrophe.

477
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:30,499
Is it possible that
all of humanity is descended

478
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:34,499
from Noah's genetic lineage-a
new species that replaced the

479
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:38,376
indigenous people who once
existed on Earth?

480
00:35:38,376 --> 00:35:41,499
And all that remains of this
once great society are the giant

481
00:35:41,499 --> 00:35:46,499
slabs of rock that were too big
to be washed away by the flood?

482
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:52,499
And if so, might we be destined
to suffer the same fate?

483
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:56,499
Perhaps further clues can be
found by looking at our own

484
00:35:56,499 --> 00:36:01,376
modern-day version
of Noah's Ark.

485
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:09,199
Spitsbergen,
Norway.

486
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:17,076
On this remote archipelago, not
far from the Arctic Ocean, lies

487
00:36:17,076 --> 00:36:23,041
the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.

488
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:29,199
Known as the "doomsday vault,"

489
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:34,076
this repository for the DNA of
plants, animals, and humans can

490
00:36:34,076 --> 00:36:39,199
withstand nearly any cataclysm,
including a flood, an

491
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:45,806
earthquake, or a nuclear blast.

492
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:52,199
The Svalbard

493
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,199
Seed Bank is a structure or a
facility that's sunk into the

494
00:36:56,199 --> 00:37:00,199
permafrost.
It's essentially an

495
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,199
international effort to deposit
as many seeds, and particularly

496
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:10,020
seeds of crop plant varieties, to
help to preserve genetic diversity.

497
00:37:14,046 --> 00:37:18,199
With the doomsday

498
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:22,199
vault, are we creating our own
modern-day ark...

499
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:25,200
one that, instead of housing
two of every living creature on

500
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,199
Earth, will house the seeds of
every kind of plant life?

501
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:33,199
The Svalbard Seed
Vault has been designed with

502
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,199
some sort of cataclysm in mind.
The idea is that in the event of

503
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:40,199
some catastrophic event, it
would still stay cold and

504
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:43,199
preserve seeds for thousands of
years.

505
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:49,199
It's sort of this last hope.
The Svalbard is

506
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,199
just one of several biological
storehouses located around the

507
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:57,076
world.
England's Millennium Seed Bank

508
00:37:57,076 --> 00:38:01,199
is even larger, while the U.S.
federal government has built a

509
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,199
similar facility in Fort
Collins, Colorado.

510
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:10,199
Scientists say one reason for
these repositories is that

511
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:14,199
another large asteroid-similar
to the one that is believed to

512
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:18,076
have caused the Great Flood--
will eventually strike Earth.

513
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:21,909
It's just a matter of time.
You always have the

514
00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:25,199
risk, and of course we've seen
it here on Earth, of having

515
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,199
large asteroids or comets hit
the planet and cause tremendous

516
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:35,076
ecological damage.
Right now, all our genetic eggs

517
00:38:35,076 --> 00:38:39,199
are in one basket.
Whether it's a comet or asteroid

518
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:46,199
hitting us, we are in jeopardy.
In February of

519
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:51,701
2013, an asteroid large enough
to take out all of New York City

520
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:56,199
came within 18,000 miles of
Earth.

521
00:38:56,199 --> 00:39:00,199
Another has been predicted to
strike the Earth sometime in the

522
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:07,199
next 20 years.
But if a great flood or some

523
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,199
other global catastrophe were
to occur today, are we prepared

524
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,367
to survive it?
And if there really are

525
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:19,701
extraterrestrial beings watching
over the Earth, are they likely

526
00:39:19,701 --> 00:39:23,199
to be the cause of such a
cataclysm?

527
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,701
Or will they simply be
observers, sitting quietly by

528
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:30,909
and letting nature take
its course?

529
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:33,199
If
extraterrestrial gods are there

530
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,199
watching us and, either aware of
future catastrophes or are

531
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:43,199
capable of making them
themselves, then perhaps we need

532
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:50,199
to be prepared for that.
We live in a precarious point

533
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:55,199
where, at any time, we could go
through another catastrophe.

534
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:01,199
And you have to ask yourself if
the extraterrestrials themselves

535
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:06,199
may not create that.
One of the

536
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:09,199
explanations for why
extraterrestrials might seek to

537
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,199
destroy humankind is because
they treat us as their property.

538
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,199
They treat us as their
offspring.

539
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:20,199
And they're able to make
decisions about humanity based

540
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:24,199
on their needs.
So perhaps their needs were

541
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:27,199
satisfied and they decided they
didn't want humankind around

542
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,909
anymore, so it's just as easy to
wipe them out as it is to

543
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:32,199
continue to perpetuate their
existence.

544
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:34,199
The
evolution of humans on this

545
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:37,199
planet has been completely and
totally an experiment on the

546
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:43,199
part of extraterrestrials.
If survival is the bottom line,

547
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:49,199
they are trying to get us over
some kind of a finish line when

548
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:55,199
we're still alive.
Our survival

549
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,199
was ensured by
extraterrestrials, way back in

550
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:04,367
the remote past, because we are
their direct offspring.

551
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:09,199
We are their product.
They, in fact, have a vested

552
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:17,199
interest in our survival.
Are we the

553
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,701
descendants of an
extraterrestrial ancestor named

554
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:24,199
Noah, who was sent to repopulate
the Earth after the Great

555
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:28,199
Flood?
And if so, are there

556
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:32,076
extraterrestrials watching over
us, even to this day?

557
00:41:32,076 --> 00:41:37,199
Not to destroy us, but simply
to see if we can prevail over

558
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,199
the Earth's next great
cataclysm?

559
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:45,076
It is a question we may not have
much time to think about

560
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:48,076
except to consider how
much or how many will survive.
