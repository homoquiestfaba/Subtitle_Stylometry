00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,380
When we come through, don't be

186
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,148
'Cause the way you walk

187
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,151

I gotta teach this man

208
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,839
We gotta teach him.

209
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,809
Wood.

Who that?

00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,286
He's one of enoch boykins'

They peeping you 'cause you got

He got lil baby

Speculation is...

00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:15,520
And you know how fish get down

00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,960

This shit just started 'cause

230
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,568
A couple of guys
outta cherry hill.

231
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,272
Man, over the weekend,

- Trouble'll find you

234
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,613
Shit.

235
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:45,416
This ain't so easy
to come by no more.

236
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,219
The record clean though.
No priors, good credit.

237
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,521
You're set.
You know.

238
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:53,091
Now, whether it works for you,
that's your problem.

239
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,126
- Good shit.

00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,427

- I know it is.

241
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,962
- [Chuckles]
- But you know.

242
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,397
But hit me.
Hit me the right way though.

243
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,532
- Man, look, i'm a little
light on cash.

244
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,502
- I don't know why i knew
you was gonna say that shit.

245
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,970
"I'm light on cash."

246
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,272
And i know you just come home,

247
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,040
so don't give me
that goddamn excuse.

248
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,642
- You know i'm about to be

249
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,543
You feel me?

250
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,647
- You's about to be on your feet

251
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,215
- Look, this is what i'ma do.

252
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,083
I got you these raven tickets

253
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,486
Monday night football.
Against the steelers.

254
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,087
This you.

255
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,090

262
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,610
You like the ravens?
- Yeah.

263
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,512
Why you ain't take me
to the game?

264
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,480
- Nah, see that was business.

265
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,683
Sometimes, you ain't got
all the cash.

266
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,651
You gotta throw in
something they love.

267
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,720
Fair exchange
ain't no robbery.

268
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,356
[Camera clicking]

269
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,594
- A man over there watching us.
- Let him look.

270
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:16,107
You got your shirt tucked in?
- Yep.

271
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,342
[Blows raspberry]

272
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:20,111
- Quit making that noise
and sit up.

273
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:24,182
Hey, man,
put your foot down.

274
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,084
Put your foot down.

275
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,019
- Ah, mr. Woods.

276
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,687
- Hey, mr. Barnes.
How you doing, sir?

277
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,389
- Good,
thanks for dropping in.

278
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,458
What, no school
for you today, young man?

279
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,259
- Ah, today is our day.

280
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:38,529
I'm just taking him out
and show how business operates.

281
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,231
- And you are here...

282
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:43,701
to try and get a loan
for $150,000.

283
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,404
What's the property worth?
- $250,000.

284
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,007
- Do you have the executive
summary that i asked for?

285
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,708
- Oh, yeah.

286
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,747
Mr. Barnes,
i believe there's

287
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,615
two kinds of people
in this world.

288
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,684
Owners and renters.

289
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,320
I wanna own something.

290
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:05,023
- And why is it
that you wanna own

291
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,492
the maryland cup
factory building?

292
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,293
I mean, that place
is barely standing.

293
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:12,230
- It's location.
Location, mr. Barnes.

294
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,098
There's no place
along the harbor

295
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,667
where people can go
for big crabs and live music.

296
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,504
We're gonna restore the feeling
of pennsylvania avenue

297
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,272
back in the '50s.

298
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:24,208
Like the way our parents
used to do it.

299
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,344
I get the best crabs
for the cheapest price.

300
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,412
- How so?

301
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,680
- It's all in the plan.

302
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,652
- "All in the plan."

303
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,795
I don't know, you really think
we need another crab shack?

304
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:46,597
There's gotta be 100 of 'em
in baltimore alone, huh?

305
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,399
- It's not only crabs.

306
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,768
I mean, we're creating
an experience

307
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,604
where you get to celebrate
life's greatest moments.

308
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:57,108
Anything from weddings,
proms, concerts.

309
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:02,346
We could even have
bar mitzvahs there.

310
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,283
- Well...

311
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:09,720
your... credit report
seems to be...

312
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,192
good.

313
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:21,299
Your business plan is...

314
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,734
intriguing.
- [Chuckling]

315
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,304
- So, mr. Woods...
- call me mike.

316
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,772
- Mike...

317
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,174
if you'll excuse me,
i'm just gonna...

318
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,710
just gonna talk
to the bank manager.

319
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,412
- I thought
you were the manager.

320
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,514
- We have a lot of managers
around here, excuse me.

321
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,887
- Put your foot down, buddy.

322
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,422
When did you become
so hard-headed?

323
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,457
Put your foot down, man.

324
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,727
Sit up straight.

325
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,699
- Why you
in here lying?

326
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,668
- I'm doing what i need to do
to make it happen.

327
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,178
- All right.

328
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,615
- Mr. Woods.
We got a problem here.

329
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,184
There's second mortgage
on that property.

330
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,519
- I don't understand.

331
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,154
- Mr. Woods,
your loan is delinquent

332
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,856
and in serious default.

333
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,691
- Well, how much do i owe?

334
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,861
- It'll take $22,000
to bring your loan up to date.

335
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:27,198
- Or we begin foreclosure
procedures on monday.

336
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,900
Am i to understand

337
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,169
that this is the first time
you're hearing about this?

338
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,738
- Yeah, this is the first time.
I didn't know anything about it.

339
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,541
- Sorry.

340
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,945
- Mr. Barnes.

341
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,813
Hey, mr. Barnes,
hold on one second.

342
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:46,551
Woody, come on.

343
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,587
What if i can get this money
by monday?

344
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,557
Do you think you can
approve the loan?

345
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,259
- If you can come up
with $22,000 by monday morning.

346
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:59,263
- Yeah, 22,000.
22,000 in cash.

347
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,399
- Well, we'd have to resubmit
the application

348
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,267
and do another appraisal.

349
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,237
But... i don't see...

Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.

Firmer grip on that.

454

- Come on, vj.
Pick it up, man.

463
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,056

- Man, ball, you.

00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,114
I'm opening my own spot.

471

40,000 square feet.
East side of canton harbor.

473
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:07,224
You know,
i can get it dirt cheap.

474
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,994
- How much is this

475
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:13,664

483
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,950
These numbers don't lie.

484
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:34,852
I just need this money

485
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:38,656

486
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,124
- My money's lean now.

487
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,992

- Maybe eight years ago.

491
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:56,940
America ain't a country,
it's a company.

492
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,043
We move knock-off
prescription drugs now.

493
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:04,915
Lower profit,
but it brings less attention.

494
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:08,352
People ain't got
no health care.

495
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,989
Ain't got no medicine.
They're suffering!

00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:45,449
He's still my man.

You guys are crazy.

What the fuck is wrong
with lil baby?

734
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:35,011
How many times i told him,

735
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:38,615
"you can't count money
with guns in your hands."

736
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:40,316

You used to be a general
in fish's army.

748

A guy like you is not supposed
to be some foot soldier.

00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:54,757
- I got my own plans, man.
I'm here doing a favor for fish.

Shit, nigga.
You got no plans.

But there's no cheese.

756
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:16,279
I mean, when have you known
fishsticks to do a favor

757
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:19,282

You are starting
to irritate me.

766

hit you yet, yo?

767
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:50,279

00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,518
Did you think maybe
you are not sent here

779
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,154
to get the money?

780
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,057

00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:56,472
Fattest crabs
you could possibly think of.

876
00:52:56,474 --> 00:52:58,541
Shrimp, crab cakes.

877
00:52:58,543 --> 00:53:02,745
- Bet your mother'll
love that.

878
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:06,949
You know, a long time ago,
a boat sailed this harbor...

879
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,621
with a young slave.

880
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:17,293
He was about your age.

881
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:18,761
He was special, though,

882
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:21,330
'cause he taught himself
how to read and write.

883
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:25,701
He taught other slaves
how to read and write too.

884
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:29,505
You know who i'm talking about?
- Yeah.

885
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:32,308
Frederick douglass.

886
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,543
- How do you know about him?

887
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,313
- We learned about him
in school.

888
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:40,316
History class.

889
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:41,817
- Oh, that's tight.

890
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:43,786
It's good they teaching
y'all that.

891
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:47,356
- Yeah.

892
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:49,658
So anytime
you start feeling like...

893
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,895
you can't make it...

894
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:56,865
think about your ancestors.

895
00:53:56,867 --> 00:54:01,704
That's what's in your spirit.
You hear?

896
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,875
- Think ma
still looks the same?

897
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:10,312
- Bet she look better.

898
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:27,463
- No word on
who put out the hit.

899
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:29,031
Could be fish.

900
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:31,500
Could've been jamison himself.

901
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:34,403
Uh... and then there's
little baby.

902
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:39,575
- I know he got problems
with me.

903
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:42,444
But he ain't gonna try
to get me killed

904
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:43,979
unless fish say so.

905
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,915
This goddamn bag... it's a noose
around my neck.

906
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,585
I gotta get it off.

907
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:51,587
So we in business?

908
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:53,656
- Look, i'ma tell you.

909
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:57,426
You know, it's hard
getting these young boys

910
00:54:57,428 --> 00:55:00,362
to buy from somebody
they ain't familiar with.

911
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:04,066
Enoch is your only chance
of getting any money tonight.

912
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:06,035
- Man, i don't fuck
with yo like that.

913
00:55:06,037 --> 00:55:08,404
He probably know who i am.

914
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:10,773
So i don't even know why
you trying to put me in that.

915
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:12,875
- What's you beefin'
with enoch for, unc?

916
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:15,077
- His little brother, man,

917
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,646
he was always trying
to do too much.

918
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,949
He tried to move in
on some of my corners.

919
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:22,785
Then he got killed.

920
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:25,087
And enoch heard that i did it.
- Oh, come on.

921
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:26,822
He don't know who you is.

922
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,691
You know, you ain't never
crossed paths.

923
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:30,759
- Man, what type of games
you trying to play with me?

924
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,528
- Now, hold,
hold right there now, hold.

925
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,597
Now, i ain't trying
to play no game.

926
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,500
Now, i owe enoch some money.

927
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:41,737
He told me if he can get
the shit on discount,

928
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:43,439
he'd wipe the slate.

929
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:45,074
- See that's that bullshit
right there, man.

930
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:47,409
- Ain't no bullshit.
You taking this shit all wrong.

931
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:49,478
I mean, listen.
Enoch is a businessman.

932
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,780
All he care about
is his scratch, his money.

933
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:53,115
He ain't thinking about you.

934
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:55,684
- I'll sell it for you.

935
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,624
I know what's up.

936
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:05,361
- You know enoch?

937
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:06,929
- No, but what i do know...

938
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,665
ain't nobody walking up
on the corners of park heights

939
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:13,969
without his say-so.

940
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:16,572
He don't know me.

941
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,144
- Shit.

942
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:26,081
Boy's got a point.

943
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:30,652
If he can keep
the focus on him...

944
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:35,157
then there's a good chance y'all
can walk out of there without...

945
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:39,661
without him noticing you.

946
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:42,664
- Yo, you want the money
or not?

947
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,883
- 40,000.

948
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:03,652
They gonna try to cut you short.
Hold tight...

949
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:05,854
for 40,000.

950
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:14,196
- Hit your headlights.

951
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,943
- What y'all want
with enoch?

952
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:37,579
- We got something
for you to count.

953
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:39,248
- Yeah?

954
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:43,685
What about main man right here?
Why you doing all the talking?

955
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,587
- Nah, he's just my protection.

00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:47,656

959
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:59,234
- Why y'all dressed

960
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:01,603
Makes enoch uncomfortable.

961
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:04,172
- Nah, we just had to handle
some business earlier.

962
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,212
- Who enoch talking to then?

963
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:11,813
- Talking to me.

964
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:15,918

00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:53,355
Where you get this kinda weight?
Shit gots to be hot.

970
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:56,258
- What's important is
if you want it or not.

971
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,928
- I need to know the history
of what's in the bag...

972
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,631
and what trouble it might
bring enoch.

973
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:07,102
- Nobody coming to claim that
shit, if that's what you mean.

974
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:14,743
- You can get 20 for it.

975
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:16,244
- Come on, man.

976
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:18,146

This a police station.

Now, tomorrow, i want you

Understood?

Now, get your book bag

01:21:26,349 --> 01:21:28,949
to your grandmother's.

- What about that?

1237
01:21:31,954 --> 01:21:35,122
- Don't you worry about this.

1238
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:45,165
- Hey, kid,

1239
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,322
- [Yawns]

1240
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:15,462
- I like that picture
you drew.

1241
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:25,272
- Those your daughters?

1242
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:29,043
- Yeah, my angels.

1243
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:34,982
About a few years younger
than you.

1244
01:22:34,984 --> 01:22:38,986
Tell you, every night
i go home...

1245
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:43,457
watch 'em in their bed,
sleep.

1246
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:48,028
Only god keep 'em safe.

1247
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:55,669
- Can't protect 'em
from bad people.

1248
01:22:57,105 --> 01:23:01,308
- [Sighs]
Yeah, i know.

1249
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:05,746
I can't help trying though.
You feel me?

1250
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:10,384
Got your whole life
ahead of you.

1251
01:23:10,386 --> 01:23:13,120
You're young.

1252
01:23:13,122 --> 01:23:19,159
You can still do something
with your life.

1253
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:28,702
Come on, i gotta talk
to your grandmother.

1254
01:23:28,704 --> 01:23:31,638
- I think it's best
that i tell her.

1255
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:36,310
Please?

1256
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:45,119
- All right.

1257
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:46,687
I'll be back in the morning,
10:00 a.m.,

1258
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:49,757
to pick both y'all up.

1259
01:23:49,759 --> 01:23:52,126
- All right.
- All right.

1260
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:45,966
- My uncle used to say

1261
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:48,969
there's two types of people
in this world...

1262
01:26:48,971 --> 01:26:51,872
owners and renters.

1263
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:54,641
But the question is...

1264
01:26:54,643 --> 01:26:58,312
what are you gonna own?

1265
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:02,716
Do you think
i'll ever find you?

1266
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:14,928
[Crying]

1267
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:59,039
- Â™ª so let me live

â™ª you can't see

1270

â™ª

1273
01:33:16,892 --> 01:33:20,694
â™ª if we build them,
aye, from love â™ª

1274
01:33:20,696 --> 01:33:22,295
â™ª

1275
01:33:22,297 --> 01:33:24,030
- â™ª where you going

â™ª

1281
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:41,681
- â™ª i woke up
in that childhood dream â™ª

1282
01:33:41,683 --> 01:33:44,784
â™ª

1283
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:47,887
â™ª but i vaguely
remember scenes â™ª

1284
01:33:47,889 --> 01:33:51,257
â™ª

1285
01:33:51,259 --> 01:33:54,928
â™ª nothing else mattered
to me â™ª

1286
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:57,364
â™ª

1287
01:33:57,366 --> 01:34:03,003
â™ª no, nothing really

1289
01:34:04,106 --> 01:34:05,839
