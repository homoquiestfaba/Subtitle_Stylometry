1
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,765
Los Angeles, are you ready?

2
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,437
Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,359
Jo Koy!

4
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,465
We did this, Los Angeles!

5
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,225
I waited a long time for this one.

6
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,150
We're in the Forum!

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,697
Finally! Two years!

8
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,158
You know what sucked?
Is this is all I know how to do.

9
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,577
Is stand-up.
And when they took that away from me,

10
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,246
it got to the point where I looked
at my son and I was like,

11
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,123
"Joe, this is all I know how to do!"

12
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,237
I looked at my son and I was like,
"We're going to starve."

13
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,007
But we're going to laugh doing it.

14
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,053
It sucked!

15
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,216
But now we're back out. Everyone's having
fun. Look at this shit. It's packed!

16
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,361
And there's a few people that are
still wearing a mask and that's fine.

17
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,417
That's your choice
and I'm not going to make fun of you.

18
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,276
Don't cancel me, please!

19
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,155
It's just my opinion.

20
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,534
But if you're going
to wear your mask tonight, good for you.

21
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,495
But chances are, you might get it tonight.

22
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,501
No one's six feet apart.

23
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,380
You are right next to that person.
They're going to be laughing like this...

24
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,848
You're wearing it.

25
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,228
I hated that fucking mask.

26
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,981
Don't get me wrong.
We all wore it. We were all scared.

27
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,904
I'm gonna be reminiscent, because
I was locked up for two fucking years,

28
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,622
so this is all I can talk about right now.

29
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:38,116
But we were all scared!
That mask was all we had!

30
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,910
We all remember that time
when we were watching TV

31
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,394
and then all of a sudden
a news anchor came out and was like,

32
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,166
"Breaking news!
People are dying everywhere!"

33
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,378
"Look at this footage!"
Then they showed some Asian guy go...

34
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,008
Fall to the fucking ground.
Then two hazmat suits came in.

35
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,571
They're like, "Oh my God, oh my God."

36
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,557
"We'll be right back to tell you
what you need to do." What the fuck?

37
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,189
Then they came back.
"This is what you need to do:

38
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,693
Wear a paper square across your mouth."

39
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,821
"You should be fine." No shit?" "Yes."

40
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,075
"And fill your refrigerators, because we
don't know how long it's going to last."

41
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,368
What the fuck?

42
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,916
I filled my refrigerator
for about two weeks.

43
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,839
I thought it was going to be done
in two weeks.

44
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,980
There were a lot of dads who thought
it was going to be done in two weeks.

45
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,131
That shit went on for two fucking years!

46
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,719
And the way my son eats,
we were out of food in four days!

47
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,307
And I think I speak
on behalf of every dad in here.

48
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,018
We felt like a fucking hero
when we were out of food.

49
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,269
We felt like a hero,

50
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,353
because every dad
walked up to the family and went,

51
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,774
"I will get this family food."

52
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,155
"I will risk my life
to go get this family,

53
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,909
macaroni and cheese,

54
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,203
and peanut butter and jelly
in the same jar."

55
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,000
"Someone give me a mask."

56
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,087
You wore that fucking mask.

57
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,880
We all wore that mask.

58
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,342
We don't know
if it was protecting us or what.

59
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,695
The only thing that we did realize,
and this is what I realized.

60
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,406
I don't know if it was protecting me,
but I know this is what I realized.

61
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,975
The minute I put on that mask
for the first fucking time,

62
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,894
I realized...

63
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,521
That my breath stunk.

64
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,317
Holy shit!

65
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,445
I never smelled my breath
like that before!

66
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,609
I think I speak on behalf
of a lot of people in here.

67
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,201
That was the first time
we smelled our breath!

68
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,079
And there are some of you in here
right now wearing the mask going,

69
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,390
"I think I know what he's talking about."

70
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,166
Yes!

71
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,212
Remember when you start wearing that mask?
I remember wearing it. I was in the store,

72
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,881
and someone was next to me,
and I smelled it and I was like,

73
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,467
"God! Is that...?"

74
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,053
"This fucker's got cavities or some shit!"

75
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,432
I started gagging.

76
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,561
"Excuse me."

77
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,149
Then I went back to my car
and I still smelled the same smell.

78
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,067
I was like, "Oh, fuck! That was me?"

79
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,486
"That was me?"

80
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,036
Fucking mask. I hate that mask!

81
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:32,332
I kind of love it,
because now I floss so much.

82
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,376
And the ones
that are wearing masks, going...

83
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,463
You know what that is?

84
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,215
That's a tomahawk ribeye in your molar.

85
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,342
You need to get it.

86
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,262
It's dying.

87
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,520
But I'm not going to lie.
That first month was the worst one.

88
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,231
We all acted the same way. It was scary!

89
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,192
Fuck. Remember the first time you went?

90
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,156
You didn't want to share
any aisle with anybody.

91
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:09,410
Six feet? Fuck that! Sixty feet!

92
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,682
You walk down that aisle and you see
someone coming down the same aisle.

93
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,166
"Excuse me, do you mind?"

94
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,629
"Please, if you don't mind.
Please. Six feet."

95
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,424
"You. That's you!"

96
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,760
"Please."

97
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,475
That was the first month!
We were all scared.

98
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,852
Don't act like you weren't!

99
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,063
You better not sneeze that first month.

100
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,733
Remember that first month?
You better not fucking sneeze!

101
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,277
You remember? You hold that sneeze in.
You're like... "Ugh God!"

102
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,366
"No!"

103
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,369
"No!" This is what you look like
under the mask. "No!"

104
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,747
"No!"

105
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,543
Because if you sneeze, what would happen?

106
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,877
"Superspreader!"

107
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,382
"This guy's a fucking superspreader!"

108
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,551
"No! No!"

109
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,470
"My girlfriend has cats!"

110
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,515
"I'm allergic to cats!"

111
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,189
It was right around month 11
that we didn't give a fuck anymore.

112
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,941
The 11th month. That's when we were like,

113
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,568
"Fuck this mask."

114
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,028
Remember that shit?
You'd just walk around.

115
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,781
If you had to sneeze,
you just did it underneath the mask.

116
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,501
Then you just wiped the boogers
with the mask.

117
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,665
Like, "Fuck this mask! Fuck this mask!"

118
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:41,294
"Fuck this mask!"

119
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:45,214
"I've been wearing it for 11 months.
It only has one string."

120
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,763
I sneeze multiple times.

121
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,265
11 times in a row, I'll sneeze.

122
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,267
That's how I sneeze. I don't sneeze once.

123
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,728
I remember I was at Home Depot.
I went at it, just...

124
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,739
Fuck it. A booger flew up.

125
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,866
A booger hit my ear.

126
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,871
I took the mask off.
I looked like I was in a Bukkake flick,

127
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,873
like, "Goddammit...".

128
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,507
"God! That's a lot!"

129
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:35,348
Fellas!
If your lady looks at you right now,

130
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,433
and goes, "What's Bukkake?"

131
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,894
Don't fucking say anything. Just...

132
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,021
Just go like this, "I don't know."

133
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,565
"I don't know why they're laughing.
That's weird."

134
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,401
"That's weird. What is that?
I don't even know."

135
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,491
And don't answer quickly!
You're going to fuck your night up.

136
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,952
You're going to fuck
your whole date night up.

137
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,247
"What's Bukkake?" "That's when
a bunch of dudes shoot their load."

138
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,123
"Like 11 dudes just go...

139
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,126
And she just takes it."
"What the fuck do you watch,

140
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,546
when I'm at work,
you creepy motherfucker?"

141
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,631
"You sick fuck!"

142
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,259
Now you've got to lie. "No, no, no!"

143
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,224
You've got to lie. "I was... I was Googling...

144
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,852
'Bouquet of flowers' for you one day...

145
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,148
And I guess I misspelled it."

146
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,323
I'm going to do a lot of my jokes
starting off like this: "Remember when?"

147
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,953
Remember when the CDC went like this?

148
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:44,333
The CDC went, "If you have lung issues
or respiratory problems,

149
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,337
just tell the security guard at the
establishment you're trying to go into

150
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,506
and they should let you in
without a mask."

151
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,633
And I was like, "Fucking bet."

152
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,762
"Let's go!"

153
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,182
I walked up. I was walking up like this.

154
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,518
The guy stopped me.
"Excuse me, Sir. You need a mask."

155
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,853
And I was like, "Oh!

156
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:09,567
Uhm... I suffer,

157
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,696
from a lung disorder,

158
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,449
so I cannot wear one of those."

159
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:20,453
And he goes,
"Sir, what is your lung disorder,

160
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,639
that prohibits you from wearing a mask?"

161
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,750
And then I said... this is what I said.
True story. I go,

162
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,878
"I didn't think you were allowed
to ask me that."

163
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,802
And he goes,
"No, Sir. We have to ask you."

164
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,947
"That way we can determine whether or not
you can come into the establishment."

165
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,183
I go, "Okay, fine. I suffer...

166
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,146
From sleep apnea."

167
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,196
Uh-oh. Oh, fuck. Let's hope this works!

168
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,240
And then he goes, "What's that?"
I'm like, "Fuck!"

169
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,496
I go, "Sir, it is a sleeping disorder,

170
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:08,542
where my lungs...
uh, when my brain goes to sleep,

171
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,960
so do my lungs."

172
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,676
"Like when my brain goes, 'Good night, '
my lungs are like, 'See ya!'"

173
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,844
"And then I just lay there like this."

174
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,224
He goes, "What the fuck?"
I go, "I know! What the fuck, right?"

175
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,894
I try to go in. He goes,

176
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,581
"Sir, I just have to ask you
a couple more questions. I believe you,

177
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,024
but I'm having problems understanding."

178
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,193
"If you don't sleep all night,

179
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,903
and you're not breathing,

180
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,197
then how are you up the next day,

181
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,782
shopping?"

182
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,661
I go, "Oh, that's easy.
I have a CPAP machine,

183
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,331
that helps me sleep at night,
and that helps me breathe."

184
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,600
And I tried to walk in. He goes,

185
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,335
"Sir, okay. Just a couple more questions."

186
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,754
I go, "Seriously, what is it?"

187
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,464
"What is your question?"

188
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,134
He goes,
"If the machine helps you breathe...".

189
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,569
"Yes, the machine helps me breathe."

190
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,761
"But how?"

191
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,514
"It just sits there?"
"No, there's a hose."

192
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:07,143
"There's a hose that pumps air
into my lungs, and that's how I breathe."

193
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,453
"All right? I've really got to get in."

194
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,896
And he was like,
"Sir, just one more question."

195
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,898
"What is it? What is the question?"

196
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,402
He goes, "How does that hose

197
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,446
stay on your face?"

198
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,240
And I go, "Uh...".

199
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,871
"I have to wear a...

200
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,963
A mask. Fuck you. I'll be right back."

201
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,923
"Fucking asshole.
What are you, a detective?"

202
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,765
No one takes sleep apnea serious!

203
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,059
They laugh when I say I have that problem.

204
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,936
"Ha ha ha! It's funny!"

205
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,522
That shit is a serious problem!

206
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,985
People with sleep apnea get to say
that we fight death every night.

207
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,945
I'm this close to dying,

208
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,867
and I fucking win every time.
I wake up a survivor.

209
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,786
Who gets to say that?
Every night, this close to dying?

210
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,664
I do! Sleep apnea. But no one respects it,

211
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,627
because I have to wear
a big fucking... mask!

212
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,018
That's why guys hate that.
That's the only thing that will cure us,

213
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,258
is a goddamn mask. There's no surgery.

214
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,802
And that's why guys hate to admit
that they have sleep apnea.

215
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,971
They'll say they're snoring
until they die.

216
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,182
And they literally fucking die!

217
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,818
I guarantee there's a guy in here,
right now,

218
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,854
and his girlfriend is like,
"You listen. Fucking...

219
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,023
Listen! Fucking idiot!"

220
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,484
Look! They're all pointing!
It's like clockwork!

221
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,903
They're all... Look! Look. She's so happy.

222
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,666
"Right here! This cocksucker, right here!"

223
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,282
Right there!

224
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,701
- What's your name?
- Dylan.

225
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,827
Dylan.

226
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,264
- How long have you been with Dylan?
- Four years.

227
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,206
Four years.

228
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,041
And he won't listen to you?

229
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,918
- Absolutely not.
- Look! "Absolutely not."

230
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,420
"Fuck that! I'm not wearing that!"

231
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,799
"I'm not wearing that thing!
I'd rather fucking die!"

232
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,803
He's serious!

233
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,931
Four years! She loves you, dude.
Wear the goddamn mask!

234
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,200
This shit will save your life!

235
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,475
- Oh, you're married?
- Yeah.

236
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,994
And he still doesn't want
to listen to you?

237
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:13,894
We're getting married.

238
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,956
- You're getting married?
- Yeah. And he still won't wear it.

239
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,857
And he still won't wear it.
Fuck him. Let him die.

240
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,194
Fuck him.

241
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,405
Fuck him, dude.

242
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,323
Fuck Dylan. Fuck Dylan.

243
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,201
That's what it will say on his tombstone.
"Fuck Dylan."

244
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,246
"Fuck Dylan. He should have been here."
He should have been here!

245
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,165
Oh, shit!

246
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,501
Dylan, it's done! It's done.

247
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,963
She's getting ready to marry you.
Why are you embarrassed?

248
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,257
This woman loves you.
She's giving you... Look at her.

249
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,135
She's wearing your ring.
You're not dating anymore.

250
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,596
It's not embarrassing.
If you were single, I'd get it.

251
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,990
Because when I was single, I hated it.

252
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,934
That shit...
Any potential of having a relationship,

253
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,853
done, the minute
I put the goddamn mask on.

254
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,438
It sucked!

255
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,416
It got to the point
where I'd hook up with a chick

256
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,443
and when we were done, I'd be like,
"You've got to leave. Now."

257
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,908
This one girl got mad, like,
"What the fuck? Seriously?"

258
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,178
"You're going to have sex and you're goin'
kick me out? What am I? A fucking whore?"

259
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,680
I was like, "No, no, no! That's not why."

260
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,541
"It's just that I have to wear something,
to sleep.

261
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,853
And it's embarrassing and I don't want
you to see that. That's all."

262
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,314
"It's not that. Not at all. I like you.
I want to continue dating you."

263
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,964
"It's just I've got to wear this thing."

264
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,216
And she's like,
"Oh, my God! You scared me!"

265
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,679
"Like, you really made me feel
like a whore!"

266
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,475
"I like you!
You don't have to be embarrassed!"

267
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,102
"I like you. That's why we took it
to the next level. Stop it!"

268
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,204
"If you've got to wear something,
wear it."

269
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,104
"Are you sure?"

270
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,315
"Yes! Oh, my God!"

271
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,401
"Stop! I like you.
What is it, Invisalign?"

272
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,618
"It's way bigger than that."

273
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,329
"Well, I don't care! Put it on."

274
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,163
"Are you sure?"

275
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,166
"Yes! I like you! Wear it!"

276
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,502
"All right..."

277
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,671
I put that fucking thing on...

278
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,271
I wake up the next morning. Bed, empty.

279
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,568
Just a note that says,
"I didn't know you were Bane."

280
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,491
So I'd get it, Dylan, if you were single!
But she loves you.

281
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,118
- What's your name, hon?
- Erin.

282
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,495
Erin. Erin loves you, Dylan!

283
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,015
She doesn't give a shit you wear a mask.
She wants you to live. She's marrying you.

284
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,959
She wants you here forever. So do I!

285
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,588
So get the goddamn mask.

286
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,341
If you were single...
Dude, there's other things

287
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,052
that she's disgusted by with you.

288
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,346
Believe me.

289
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,098
Have you recorded him yet?

290
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,308
- Yes.
- You have?

291
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,354
He's seen it in 4K? Man, fuck this guy!

292
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,358
My mom recorded me on a camcorder.

293
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,986
A camcorder!

294
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,239
And there's probably kids in here
that are like, 14 or 13, going,

295
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,199
"What the fuck is a camcorder?"

296
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,578
You know that camera that's on your phone?

297
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,247
That used to be a separate device!

298
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,917
And it was huge! Huge, like...

299
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,138
Zoom, zoom, zoom.

300
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,224
Zoom. Press zoom. Zoom.

301
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,446
My mom recorded me on a camcorder.

302
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,990
You know what I mean? Not 4K. An old...

303
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,702
This was like, in the late '90s
when she recorded me.

304
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,162
And here's the thing.

305
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,515
She recorded me at like three o'clock in
the morning when I was dead asleep.

306
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,084
And the thing is with the camcorders
back then,

307
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,961
you didn't need any lights
because there was an option, a button,

308
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,338
that said "night vision."

309
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,900
And my mom clicked that thing
and it was like,

310
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,467
The Blair Witch Project.

311
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,346
She was shooting a documentary,
like, "My son...

312
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,891
My son says that he is snoring."

313
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,145
"But he is not snoring. He's dying."

314
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,406
"Let's take a closer look.
Come on. Let's go."

315
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,115
You know what it is, Erin? I think

316
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:41,578
Dylan needs to see it live,
to really experience it,

317
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,265
because on the phone, no matter what...
You can watch anything on the phone

318
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,460
and you're not really feeling the emotion
that Erin is feeling every night

319
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,880
while she watches her fiancé wither away.

320
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,135
So I'm going to do this, for Erin.

321
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,678
We're going to role play.

322
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,389
I'm gonna be Dylan.
You're gonna be Erin. You ready?

323
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,851
This is what Erin sees
every fucking night. Feel it!

324
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,061
Feel the emotion that she feels.

325
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,855
- Get into character!
- Got it.

326
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:11,191
Ready? This is you, every night.
This is how you sleep.

327
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,702
Look! She went, "Yes!"

328
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,788
Bro, you know, Dylan?
Your own hand tries to wake you up.

329
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,416
Did you know that?
Your own hand is like...

330
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,347
You know what you look like,
when you sleep?

331
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,182
Swear to God, this is what you look like.

332
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,893
You look like a ghost

333
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,604
is cramming his dick in your mouth

334
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,524
and you're just sucking ghost dick
all night, just...

335
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,492
And Erin's like,
"Stop sucking that ghost dick!"

336
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,663
"Dylan, stop sucking ghost dick, please!
Stop it!"

337
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,164
And you're like...

338
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,463
Just a line of ghosts
at the foot of your bed.

339
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,298
Just a line...

340
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,443
And they're like, "Yo, he thinks
he's snoring. Come on! Two at a time!"

341
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,760
He's like, "What the fuck?"

342
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,805
"Yo, Dylan's a crazy little fucker.
Let's go!"

343
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,356
"Three, three, three!" "Goddamn!"

344
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,234
"Shit!"

345
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,737
"Three dicks, Dylan? Stop!"

346
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,531
"Stop sucking ghost dick!"

347
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,746
You ever notice,

348
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,750
Dylan, when you wake up in the middle
of the night, you wake up like this?

349
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,507
Ghost Bukkake.

350
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,727
I'm selling CPAP machines
at the merch booth.

351
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,025
You know how funny that would be

352
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,485
if I had CPAP machines at the merch booth?

353
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,112
I'd be the only...

354
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:05,490
I'd be the only entertainer
selling CPAP machines

355
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,742
at the merch booth!

356
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,370
That shit would be so hilarious.
Just people leaving my show like,

357
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:14,082
"Not only was Jo Koy funny,
but I think he saved my life."

358
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,085
"Thanks, Jo Koy."

359
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,388
Got an infomercial.

360
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,226
Got an infomercial.
Dylan, do my infomercial.

361
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,065
"Hi. My name's Dylan."

362
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:47,157
"Hi. My name's Dylan, and for years,

363
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,995
I was addicted to sucking ghost dicks
at night."

364
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,124
"I would tell my wife
that I was 'snoring.'"

365
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,214
"But then I went to Jo Koy's comedy show

366
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,758
and I bought a CPAP machine."

367
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:08,887
"And guess what?
No more sucking ghost dick!"

368
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,644
"But guess who's sucking dick now?"

369
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,355
"Erin."

370
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,607
"Thanks, Jo Koy!"

371
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,581
Remember when we ran out of toilet paper?

372
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,587
What the fuck kind of pandemic is this?
Ran out of toilet paper!

373
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:46,383
I'd never seen humans turn into monsters!

374
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:50,345
On the news, you just saw
people with shopping carts

375
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:54,224
filled with rolls of toilet paper,
running to their car,

376
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,768
and then someone right behind them,
chasing them, like,

377
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,021
"My asshole is itchy too, bitch!"

378
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,360
"What am I supposed to do
with my itchy asshole?"

379
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,362
"Bitch!"

380
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,033
It scared me.

381
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,829
People beating up people for toilet paper,
like there was no other solution.

382
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,791
My mom was ready
for a toilet paper shortage.

383
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,794
She's been preparing
for that toilet paper shortage

384
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,505
since the day she got to this country.

385
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,633
When people ran out of toilet paper,

386
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,178
my mom was like, "What is going on?
I don't understand."

387
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,306
My mom has never run out of toilet paper!

388
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:38,018
My mom can use one roll of toilet paper
for a year!

389
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,769
A year!

390
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:43,523
And I know there are women in here going,
"How the fuck is that possible?"

391
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,818
I'll tell you how. This only goes

392
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,821
to the women that aren't Filipino.

393
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,909
I'm going to tell you a secret
that my mom does

394
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,870
and the reason why she never
runs out of toilet paper.

395
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,789
And this is only to the women
that aren't Filipino.

396
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,126
When my mom pees,

397
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,961
she doesn't wipe.

398
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,231
Oh, I heard a woman right there go, "Ew!"

399
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,758
Look. She's covering her mouth!
And she waved!

400
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,927
Look! Right there in the jeans.

401
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,511
Jean jacket. She went, "Ew!"

402
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,764
Like, "Oh, my God!"

403
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,700
"Oh, my God!" And then she went
like this. "Oh, that was me!"

404
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,060
"That's... Ew! Ew!" Look at her!

405
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,772
I'm going to tell you why.
What's your name?

406
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,483
- Eileen.
- Eileen, let me tell you why,

407
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,985
she doesn't use paper. All right, Eileen?

408
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,946
Because she washes it with water.

409
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,114
So ew you, bitch.
Don't you ever disrespect...

410
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,161
My mom's pussy in Los Angeles!

411
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,790
My mom's pussy is the cleanest pussy...

412
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,377
In Los Angeles!

413
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,382
And I take that back.

414
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,177
I didn't mean it.
"Bitch" like in "term of endearment."

415
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,221
I love you.

416
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,141
I used to say the same thing, Eileen.

417
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,978
I did. I used to be like,
"Mom, why don't you just wipe?"

418
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,229
"Just wipe!"

419
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,148
And my mom, quick! With the quickness!

420
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,527
"You want me to just wipe?
You think that's clean, Joseph?"

421
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,946
"I go pee-pee and then wipe,

422
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,490
just wipe pee-pee all over my pekpek?"

423
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,327
"That's clean to you, Joseph?"

424
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:23,331
"Just pee-pee and then smear the pee-pee
all over the pekpek?"

425
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,668
"And make it salty? Salty pekpek?"

426
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,006
"I wash it, Joseph, with water!"

427
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,049
"Brand-new!"

428
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:37,220
"Brand-new!"

429
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,848
"Brand-new!"

430
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,101
What?

431
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,563
If you really think about it,
that's brilliant! She's right!

432
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:50,025
Look at her. She was prepared.
Never ran out of toilet paper!

433
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,944
And never had a salty pussy!

434
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,783
Look. Women are agreeing. I see
some women going, "You know what? Yeah."

435
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,871
It's a brilliant idea.

436
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,458
Maybe one of those dog...
You know those portable dog dishes?

437
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,501
The ones that fan out and you close it?

438
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,465
It looks just like a little circle,
and then it pops up into this little...

439
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,757
Maybe bring that around.

440
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,594
That's what my mom has!

441
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,638
It's a different version.
She calls it a tabo.

442
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,977
It's a cup!

443
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,857
There's a lot of people in here going,
"What's a tabo?"

444
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,486
Especially the ones that aren't Filipino.
I'm going to tell you what a tabo is.

445
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,112
A tabo can be anything.

446
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,367
A coffee mug with a broken handle.

447
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,872
An empty "I Can't Believe
It's Not Butter!" container.

448
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,169
Or my mom's favorite:
A Super Big Gulp cup.

449
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,215
"Because it holds 44 ounces
of water, Joseph!"

450
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,301
"I can really clean it, huh?"

451
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:02,055
And my mom's tabo sits in the same spot

452
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,308
it always sat in
since the day she moved to this country.

453
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:09,813
Between the shower and the toilet.

454
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:14,401
That little area right there is called
"tabo lane."

455
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,988
And that's where
my mom's special cup sits.

456
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,343
And I know there are a lot of guys in here
that aren't Filipino going,

457
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,411
"Why are you telling us this, Jo Koy?"

458
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,162
Well, I'll tell you why.

459
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,916
Say you start dating a Filipino chick
and things go well.

460
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,836
You hook up one night
and you stay the night at her house.

461
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,648
You wake up the next morning. You brush
your teeth, you're like, "I need a cup."

462
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,715
Don't use that fucking cup.

463
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,722
That cup is not for your mouth.

464
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,187
Now, my mom and dad divorced
when I was about ten, eleven years old.

465
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:55,400
There's four of us.
There's Robert, Rowena, Gemma and myself.

466
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,696
Whatever my mom needed, she got. She was
the mother and father. I always said this.

467
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,991
It didn't matter what she asked for.
You got it for her.

468
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,868
You don't question her. You get it.

469
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,496
And you listen to our mom.

470
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,709
Here's the thing,
no matter what she asks for.

471
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,838
Sometimes, my mom would go to the bathroom

472
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,048
and forget to fill her tabo.

473
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,264
And of course,
the youngest would have to fill it.

474
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,267
It always...

475
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,604
It always happened
when there were friends at the house.

476
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,542
Just playing with my friends in the living
room and then all of a sudden I hear,

477
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,984
"Joseph!"

478
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,155
"Joseph!"

479
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,200
And I can tell by the acoustics,

480
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,162
that my mom forgot to fill her tabo.

481
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,664
"Joseph!"

482
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,334
"Joseph!"

483
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,212
My friend would walk up to me.
"Why are you ignoring your mom?"

484
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,562
And I'd be like, "You don't want to know
what the fuck she wants."

485
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,718
"Now just shut up."

486
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,763
"Joseph, I hear you!"

487
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,681
"Fuck!"

488
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,185
I'd walk so slow down that hallway...

489
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:17,273
Open up that bathroom door
and there she is,

490
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,692
sitting there with her tabo.

491
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,571
"What took you so long?"

492
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,702
"It's all dried-up already."

493
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,836
"Fill that up for me!" "God!"

494
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,797
I'd get so mad. "God!"

495
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,384
"I'm too old for this, Mom!
I shouldn't be seeing this!"

496
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,135
"I'm too old, Mom!"

497
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,639
My mom would be like, "See what?"

498
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,267
"Joseph."

499
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,477
"Joseph."

500
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,523
"Turn around."

501
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,026
"Turn around. See what?"

502
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,779
"This?"

503
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,616
"You used to live here."

504
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:15,790
"This was your old house
before we moved into this house."

505
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,625
"Now help me clean your old house!"

506
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,296
"God!"

507
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,216
I'd fill that cup up
with freezing cold water...

508
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,805
And run down the hallway.
My mom was screaming... "Joseph!

509
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,224
It's freezing cold!"

510
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,853
"You're going to give my pussy pneumonia!"

511
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,027
My friend was like,
"You gave your mom's pussy pneumonia?"

512
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:53,453
I mean, think about it. Think about it.
I mean, that's kind of cool.

513
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,996
That's what I love about comedy.

514
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,582
I can tell you about my culture,

515
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,894
and you can relate to it
or you can't relate to it. That's fine.

516
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,838
At least you get to hear about my life,
my story, and just hear, "Oh, goddamn."

517
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,928
Have you ever noticed that Filipinos,
we love Black people?

518
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,932
We love Black culture.

519
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,184
You don't have to explain anything to us.

520
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,062
We just get it.
It's almost like we're the same.

521
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,608
The food... Have you seen our food?
It's like soul food.

522
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,820
They have so much soul.
They sing. It's crazy!

523
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:32,033
I think it's that Spanish that's in us.
The Spanish that's in us. That's why.

524
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,872
And you know when there's Mexicans...

525
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,922
You know when there's Mexicans...

526
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,008
Out of all the Latinos, Mexicans are very...

527
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,386
They're proud people, but...

528
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,392
But they identify with Filipinos so much

529
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:01,104
because of that Spanish blood
that we have.

530
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,482
And that's why they come to my shows,
because they identify.

531
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,605
They're like, "What the fuck?
They're just like us!"

532
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,256
And they're in here. That's when
you know there's Mexicans in here.

533
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,241
Once I say, "Mexicans...".

534
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,249
They start whistling.

535
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,419
And that's when you know
there's Mexicans in here,

536
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,589
because no one whistles better
than Mexicans.

537
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,390
Close your eyes.
It's like you're in a bird sanctuary.

538
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,896
So beautiful!

539
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,231
No one whistles like that.

540
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,781
Each one distinct!

541
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,162
Their kids know that whistle.

542
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:03,041
They can lose their kids in the mall
and just whistle.

543
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,501
"Papá? Papá!"

544
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:12,091
"Papá! Papá! Papá!"

545
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,928
"Papá!"

546
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,686
I just want you to know, Mexicans,

547
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,439
this is how similar we are.

548
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:32,987
When the Spanish left the Philippines,
you left everything there.

549
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,573
That's why we're the same.
You know what I mean?

550
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,384
That's why we act the same.
They left everything there.

551
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,577
Their culture's just like our culture.

552
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,288
They do everything.
You guys work hard, we work hard.

553
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,127
Fiesta? Fiesta!

554
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:54,425
Mariachi? Karaoke! Same shit.

555
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,262
No one really wants to hear it.

556
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,856
But even our words are the same,

557
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,818
because when you left,
you left your fucking words there,

558
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:15,279
and we took them. You left them there,
so we fucking took them.

559
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,657
But we changed it.

560
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,119
We turned your curse words into desserts.

561
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,706
So know that.
I want every Mexican to know that.

562
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,292
If you have a Filipino co-worker,
just know

563
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,754
we took your curse words
and turned them into desserts.

564
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,089
So don't get mad,

565
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,050
if that little tiny Filipino lady,
comes to the...

566
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:42,306
Comes to work one day
and walks into the break room

567
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,351
with a tray of desserts
and walks up to you and goes,

568
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,520
"Put this in your mouth, puto."

569
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,363
Don't get mad.
"What the fuck did you call me?"

570
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,992
Because I get it.
In your language, puto means "bitch."

571
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:05,163
But in our language, it's a
delicious dessert with coconut on it,

572
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,166
and she just wants you
to put it in your mouth,

573
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,500
"puto."

574
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,139
I'm selling putos out front.

575
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,933
It's the craziest merch booth!

576
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,477
CPAP machines,

577
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,771
and tabos!

578
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,275
It's basically all the cups
and empty water bottles you're not using.

579
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,652
We're going to clean them out
and I'm going to sign them.

580
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,447
Some of you
are going to drive home tonight.

581
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:44,493
You're going to look at your wife and go,
"Maybe we should get a tabo."

582
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,874
And I'm not saying it's dirty.

583
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,169
That's not what I'm saying.
But like, sometimes, women,

584
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:57,423
when you go to the bathroom, especially
tonight, like date night for some of you,

585
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,385
and on date night,
you run to the bathroom real quick,

586
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,779
and you don't want to miss the show,

587
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,181
so you run back as fast as you can,
but you're peeing,

588
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:08,684
so you hurry up. And here's the thing
about women when you pee and you wipe.

589
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:12,146
I always thought the vagina was delicate,

590
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:16,317
and fragile. But women don't give a...

591
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:21,447
They don't give a fuck about...
like fuck, like...

592
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,368
Like they wipe it like they're oiling
a catcher's mitt.

593
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,828
Like, "Dry already, pussy! Let's go!"

594
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:34,794
And then you run back to your seat.
"Did I miss anything?"

595
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,131
"No, you didn't miss anything."
"Okay, good."

596
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,594
And then the rest of the night goes great,

597
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,389
and then you go home. Things go well.

598
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:50,059
But you forgot what you did,
how aggressive you were.

599
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,563
And a lot of you leave
little tiny treats down there.

600
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,442
What? What?

601
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,862
You do! Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about. Little tiny...

602
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,615
Little tiny toilet paper nuggets.

603
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,369
Little tiny fun treats.

604
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,122
"Clitty litter."

605
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,293
And it's there. You forgot!

606
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,168
And now he goes down on you,
and he goes like this.

607
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:24,218
And you're like, "What is it?"
And he goes, "Nothing!"

608
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,096
Because we never say anything.

609
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:30,057
We never say anything!
That's how much we love you.

610
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,059
That's how much your man loves you.

611
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,146
We're going to eat that fucking
toilet paper. We don't give a shit.

612
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,316
Eat that shit. Eat it.

613
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,401
It took us two weeks to go down on you.

614
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,821
You think we're going to fuck it up
on a little tiny spitwad?

615
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:47,241
Eat that shit! Some of them are big,
and we chew it, like...

616
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,495
Spit it out, like...
All of us.

617
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:55,416
Don't. Every guy in here knows what
I'm talking about. You eat it, you eat it...

618
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,336
Dylan! Dylan will eat a whole goddamn roll
of toilet paper.

619
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,590
Squeeze the
fucking Charmin right here.

620
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,806
I'm not saying it's gross! It's fine.

621
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,185
I'm not calling you out on it. It's okay!

622
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,729
We eat it! It's there. Fuck it!

623
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,441
Not like you guys. What do you do to us?

624
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,443
They make us feel creepy.

625
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,029
You guys make us feel so creepy.
One little piece of lint!

626
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,948
One little piece of lint at the tip,

627
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,284
and now the blow job's done.

628
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,745
You fucking assholes!

629
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,039
You just see it, like, "What the fuck?"

630
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,255
"Suck your own dick. I can't!"

631
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:47,385
"I can't."

632
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:55,267
My son's got it good. He doesn't have
to worry about filling a tabo for his mom.

633
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,770
There's a bidet now.

634
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,606
My son has a bidet. A dope bidet.

635
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,984
You pee at night, the lid opens up.
It's like, lights turn on.

636
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,696
"Pee here." It says it.
Like, "Come here. Pee." It talks.

637
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,117
"Hey man, what's up? Come over here.
Pee in my mouth."

638
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,205
That's the cool thing
about this generation.

639
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:19,750
They've got everything.
They've got everything they need.

640
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,434
They don't have to worry about the shit
that we had to go through.

641
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,713
Fuck. They've got it good.

642
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,967
I felt sorry for my mom.
Like, I don't know how my mom did it.

643
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,137
I've got all the tools
to keep an eye on my son.

644
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,639
I wish... if my mom had it... oh, my God.

645
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:39,145
Like if I didn't come home when my mom
told me to come home, she'd go crazy.

646
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,356
"Be home at ten. Please, Joseph.
Come home at ten."

647
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,483
30. "Oh, my God!"

648
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,238
"Oh, my God! Where is he?"

649
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,241
"Someone kidnapped Joseph again!"

650
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,827
"Someone kidnapped Joseph again."

651
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,830
Which means I was kidnapped before.

652
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,875
I was never kidnapped.

653
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,754
With my son? "Find My Son" app.

654
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,757
I press a button.
If he doesn't return my text...

655
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,760
I'll text him five times.
"Hey, where are you?" Doesn't return.

656
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,888
"Hey, answer your phone." Doesn't return.

657
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,473
"Hey man, where are you?"

658
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,641
I just press the "Find My Son" app
and a little emoji

659
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,935
of my son is in front of 7-Eleven
like this.

660
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,398
And I can go to sleep!

661
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,485
The shit these kids have are amazing.

662
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,696
And you've got to tell them
how good they've got it.

663
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:34,408
They can download a movie in less than
five minutes. Less than that. A minute!

664
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,579
4K, they can watch a movie. You've got
to tell them how hard we had it,

665
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,498
what we had to do for the new movie.

666
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,501
"New Release Tuesdays"
at Blockbuster Video.

667
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:49,256
Where they promised you a 100 copies
of Jurassic Park,

668
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,967
and you got there early
and you ran up to that display wall

669
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:55,012
and you flipped every cover, and it said,
"Out of stock, out of stock,

670
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,723
out of stock, out of stock." "Fuck!"

671
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,808
Then you ran up to the counter.

672
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,061
"Did anyone return Jurassic Park?"

673
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,190
And then he goes, "No, but we have some
coming in, in two hours."

674
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:09,193
"I'll wait!" And you fucking stood there
by the counter.

675
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,488
And you looked out that window
where the return drop was, like a nerd,

676
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,822
just scouting.

677
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:18,494
Then you'd see people dropping covers in,

678
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,704
and you'd try to read them real fast.

679
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,041
You saw one go in. It had letters J and U.
You were like, "Oh! I think that was...".

680
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,460
"Sir! I think he just dropped
Jurassic Park!"

681
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,296
"I saw a J and a U! I'm pretty sure
that was Jurassic Park!"

682
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,091
"I've been here four hours. Please!"

683
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,443
And the guy's like, "Here you go, buddy.

684
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,136
And you're like, "Thank you so much. Yes!"

685
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,820
Then you look at it and you're like,
"Jumanji? I don't want this!"

686
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,188
Kid's got it good!

687
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,735
You know, I drink bottles...
I drink this bottled water,

688
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,488
and it started... 9.5 pH is the one

689
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,408
that was sold to me, by my son.

690
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,731
This is this generation.
This is how good they've got it.

691
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,913
I'm paying like, five dollars a bottle.
What the fuck am I doing?

692
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,542
Because one day my son
came home from school.

693
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,587
It was like the fourth grade.
I don't know what grade.

694
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,482
He was really young, and he came back
with a note from the teacher that said,

695
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,968
"Can you please pack bottled waters
for your son?"

696
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:19,072
"Three bottles, if you don't mind, because
we're shutting off the water fountains."

697
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,516
I was like, "What?"
They said, "Preferably 9.5 pH."

698
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,476
"Give them healthier water."

699
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,479
I was like,
"Joe, what is this 9.5 pH water?"

700
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,982
He said, "Oh, they want us to drink
9.5 pH water."

701
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,568
"It's healthier water for us.
It's really healthy."

702
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,738
"What does pH stand for, Joe?"
He goes, "Perfect hydration."

703
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,114
I go, "What?"

704
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:45,914
This fucker doesn't even know what it is.
We both don't know.

705
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,060
I go, "Why are they turning off the water
fountains, Joe? What is this all about?"

706
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:52,421
He goes,
"Oh, there's fluoride in the water

707
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:56,800
and it's not good for you, so they're
shutting off all the water fountains,

708
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,345
because there's fluoride in the water."

709
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,430
I go, "Joe, you don't brush your teeth."

710
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,477
"You should drink all of that water."

711
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,859
Fluoride in the water!

712
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:17,321
They're turning off all the water
fountains at the school. Shut them off!

713
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,823
I had to start buying bottled waters

714
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,243
for these kids. What the fuck?
We drank out of that water fountain!

715
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,704
I think I came out all right. I think.

716
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,581
I think a lot of us did.

717
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,601
We enjoyed water fountain moment.
You remember that?

718
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,878
That minute when each class
had to come out?

719
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,338
Each class got to come out

720
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,182
and they'd line up, single-file line,
in front of that water fountain,

721
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,886
and each kid got ten seconds
to drink as much water as he could.

722
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,847
And all the other kids would count.
"One one-thousand,

723
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,391
two one-thousand,

724
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,102
three one-thousand, four one-thousand...

725
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,937
And that kid's mouth is going...

726
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:56,902
"Four one-thousand, five one-thousand,
six one-thousand..."

727
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,782
"Seven one-thousand, eight one-thousand..."

728
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,495
That fucking kid was struggling!

729
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:13,419
Because the plumber that installed the
fountain put the water pressure so low,

730
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:16,463
it was barely dribbling over that nipple!

731
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,590
And he was just sucking it, licking it!

732
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,843
How healthy was that shit?

733
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,262
Sucking...

734
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,516
And what was that green crusty shit?

735
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:31,437
What the fuck was that? COVID-14?

736
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,404
These kids don't even know what a hose is!

737
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,074
They don't know what a hose is.
That was our bottled water!

738
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,034
You rode around for five hours.

739
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,579
You looked at your friend.
"You guys thirsty?" "Yeah!"

740
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,624
And you pulled up to any house,

741
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,710
any house with a hose in the front lawn.

742
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:58,255
That was communal!
Anyone got to use that shit.

743
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,965
Public property!

744
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,052
And you ran. We fucking ran! We all ran.

745
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,805
Who would get the hose first?
"I got it first!"

746
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,600
That kid thought he won, but he didn't!

747
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,603
Because he has no idea that there's water
in the middle of the hose

748
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,481
that boiled up to 450 degrees!

749
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,694
Now he's about to get a mouthful of lava.
"Turn it on!"

750
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:34,500
These kids don't even know what a hose is!
They don't know what a hose is!

751
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,769
I asked my son the other day.
I go, "Joe, do you know what a hose is?"

752
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:39,546
He's like, "Those bitches
at the club, Dad?" I'm like, "Joe...".

753
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,686
They've got it so good.

754
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,440
I love it though. I will say this.

755
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:02,945
I do love this digital era
that we live in,

756
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,030
the stuff that we have. I love it.

757
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:08,200
It's easier to raise a kid, you know?

758
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,661
His mommy and I have been divorced
for a long time,

759
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:14,331
but we're close, and we're great parents
because of these tools.

760
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,500
You know what I mean? Because of FaceTime,

761
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,461
because of camera apps and all that,
we can keep an eye on him.

762
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,047
And we work together as a team. I love it!

763
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,428
She lives right down the street from me.
She's got all the codes to my house.

764
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,889
She's got all the... Whatever I need.
If he stays at my place

765
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,534
and I'm on the road,
I can just FaceTime her

766
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,786
and she'll go over and take care
of whatever I need to take care of.

767
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,188
Yo, it's the best situation. I love it.

768
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,983
But here's the thing.
No matter how many tools we have,

769
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,776
teenagers will be teenagers.

770
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,822
He's doing the same fucked-up shit
I was doing when I was a kid.

771
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,198
And he doesn't care!

772
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,326
He thinks he's getting away with it.
I don't understand how.

773
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,705
He knows I've got all these cameras.
He doesn't give a shit!

774
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,959
Perfect example. I was going
to Connecticut. This was when he was 15.

775
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,752
I was going to Connecticut,

776
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:04,923
and I told my son. I go, "Joe, look.
I'm going to Connecticut, all right?"

777
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:08,093
"And if you throw a party,
I'm going to know."

778
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,553
"So don't throw a party."

779
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,781
And my son goes,
"Dad, I'm not going to throw a party."

780
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,891
I go, "Joe, just listen to me.
Don't throw a party, okay?"

781
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:18,854
"Don't do it." He goes,
"Dad, I'm not going to throw a party."

782
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,248
"I promise. I won't invite anybody."

783
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:23,942
I go, "Listen to me. Just hear me out.
If you throw a party, Joe,

784
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,737
and one of your friends
jumps into the pool

785
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,781
and breaks their fucking neck,

786
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,450
they're going to sue me,

787
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,994
and everything I've worked so hard for,

788
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,997
to give to you when I leave this earth,

789
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:39,791
is going to go to dipshit Dave...

790
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,935
Because he dove into the shallow end
at two o'clock in the morning

791
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,297
with the lights off."

792
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,424
"Do you want to give everything
to dipshit Dave?"

793
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:51,762
He said, "No, Dad! Don't worry about it."
I go, "Promise me." "I promise!"

794
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,847
I go to Connecticut.

795
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,475
Five o'clock in the morning
my time in Connecticut

796
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,769
that means it's two o'clock
in the morning in LA.

797
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:01,438
This is what I wake up to.

798
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,945
It's my camera app. I open it.

799
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,697
Kids,

800
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,367
walking from the house to the pool.

801
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,499
"Fucking asshole!"

802
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,043
"You fucking asshole!"

803
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,337
"Fuck! You liar!"

804
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,839
"How many fucking kids?"

805
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,928
"Fuck!"

806
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,597
The last kid that walked past the camera
was my son.

807
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,201
This is how he walked past the camera.

808
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,318
I FaceTimed his mom.

809
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,348
"Hello." You're not going to
believe what the fuck your son's doing.

810
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,642
"Oh, my God. What the fuck is he doing?"
"He's throwing a goddamn party!"

811
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,726
"What? He said he was asleep."

812
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,895
"He's not the fuck asleep! He's throwing
a party and they're jumping in the pool."

813
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,255
"What the fuck?"
"I know! What the fuck, right?"

814
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,316
"And you know what I told him?"
"What did you tell him?"

815
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,467
"I told him if one of those kids
jumps in the pool,

816
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,195
they're going to break their neck.
And guess what? They're going to sue me."

817
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,822
"Yeah, I know that!"
"And guess what? When they sue me..."

818
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,140
"What? What about it?"
"If they sue me, no money for you!"

819
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,308
She's like, "What the fuck?"
I go, "What the fuck?"

820
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,896
She goes, "Let's go!"
I go, "Let's fucking go!"

821
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:30,402
So we got in her car.
She put me into the passenger seat.

822
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,948
"Your son's a fucking asshole." "I know!"

823
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,326
I reach for the seatbelt.

824
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,419
We pull up the driveway.
All the lights go off.

825
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:45,625
All the kids leave.
She walks right up to the front door.

826
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,627
"Open up the door!"

827
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,173
"Joe! Open up the fucking door!"

828
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,177
He opens the door.
He acts like he just woke up.

829
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,392
"We know you weren't sleeping.
Plus your feet are wet."

830
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,396
"I can't believe you threw a party."

831
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,708
"Your dad's so pissed." "What are
you talking about, 'Dad's pissed?'"

832
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,651
"Your dad is fucking pissed."
"What do you mean, 'Dad's pissed?'"

833
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,945
"Your dad is pissed."

834
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,825
The phone was still hooked up
to the Bluetooth.

835
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,707
I was yelling at the front seat
for 15 fucking minutes.

836
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,923
This is my fourth special with Netflix.

837
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,056
But I'm going to tell you,

838
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,809
it's a love-hate relationship
with Netflix.

839
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,727
I'm going to say, I love them to death.

840
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,104
It's my fourth one.

841
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:32,524
But that first one? They didn't
give it to me! They didn't give me it!

842
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,485
And they're in here!
All the execs are in here. I see you!

843
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,947
And I love them! I love them for it.

844
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,783
But they didn't know
I'm cut from a different cloth.

845
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,907
If you're going to tell me no, I'm going
to show you why you need to say yes.

846
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,378
So when you watch Live from Seattle,
my first Netflix special,

847
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:57,007
just know Netflix said no to me
several times

848
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,634
and I had to pay for that shit myself!

849
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,683
Paid for it. All of it.

850
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:10,520
All in. Everything that I worked for
since 1989

851
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,023
went into that special. Broke!

852
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:16,693
Upstairs in the green room,
crying to my agent and my manager.

853
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:19,070
"This is fucked up!"

854
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,031
My son asleep on the couch.

855
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:24,200
"This is fucked up!
Why do I have to pay for my special?"

856
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,996
"I've got guys opening for me. They've got
a special. I don't get a fucking special?"

857
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,375
And my agent and my manager were like,
"Fucking kill it. We'll handle business."

858
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:36,171
"Just go out there and do
what you do best." I was like...

859
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:39,633
"Coming to the stage, Jo Koy!"
And I walked out like I didn't cry.

860
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,134
"Hi, everyone."

861
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,679
Not only did they say no to me,

862
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,806
but when they found out I was shooting it,

863
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,643
they called my agent and my manager
about two days prior

864
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,604
and they go, "Hey, we heard Jo Koy
is shooting his own special."

865
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,107
"We just want you to know
we really don't want it."

866
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,029
What the fuck?

867
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,406
They really said that!

868
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,743
That's the kind of pressure... like, what?

869
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,746
The one network I want
to pay for this special

870
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,123
and they're telling me right now,
"We don't want it."

871
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,583
I haven't even shot it yet!

872
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,629
I just got all these cameras!

873
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,800
Didn't stop me. You still do it.

874
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,469
Fucking barefoot!
No matter what the obstacle is.

875
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,519
I'm sorry I turned this into a TED Talk.

876
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:38,566
I don't want to sit here and talk
about my mom's pussy for 15 minutes

877
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,111
and then motivate you.

878
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,405
I'm just saying,
sometimes you need to hear struggle

879
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,115
to success.

880
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,575
For every successful story,
there's a lot of struggle.

881
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,205
And don't let anyone shit on your dreams!

882
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,957
I'm not saying Netflix shit on my dreams,

883
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,018
but it was my dream
and you weren't going to say no to me.

884
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,335
I was going to die trying.

885
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,462
I was broke when I shot that shit!

886
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,298
Cut it up myself, edited it up myself.

887
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,468
I became an editor, a producer.
I did all that! Wore all the hats.

888
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,595
Then I cut it up
and I brought it to Netflix.

889
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,806
I was like,
"I know you guys said no to me...

890
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,728
But can you please look at it
one more time?"

891
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,189
I put that thing on their desk.

892
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,776
They called me an hour later.
"Don't shop it anywhere else. We want it."

893
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,445
That's the story.

894
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,242
I know we live in a hard time right now.

895
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,536
And I know we all hear the same thing,

896
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:34,330
that, "Oh, you know,
it's not fair for everybody,"

897
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,054
and blah-blah, and a lot of you are like,
"Oh, fuck that. Stop it."

898
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,377
"It's 2022."

899
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,629
"Stop it. That's a lame excuse."
No, it's not!

900
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:45,008
Not all of us get the same shake
that you did.

901
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,302
Not all of us get to be heard.

902
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:49,679
Not all of us get the fair shake.

903
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,848
Like, some of us have to do
a little bit extra,

904
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,325
and you've got to be aware of that.

905
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:56,311
Just know that.
It's not easy for all of us.

906
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,649
There's a lot of voices in here
that need to be heard,

907
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,194
and we don't get an opportunity
like you do sometimes.

908
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,863
So just understand that.
It's not easy for all of us.

909
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,740
And I will tell you this one story,

910
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:12,869
this is to promote Live from Seattle.
Let me tell you how hard it was for me.

911
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:16,456
And this just happened in 2016,
so it wasn't that long ago.

912
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,018
But here's the story I want to tell you
about Live from Seattle.

913
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,294
I was put on a show to help promote it.

914
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:23,417
And I'm not going to tell you
the name of that show.

915
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,633
I submitted the routine,

916
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:30,595
and this is the note I got back
for the routine. Just hear me out.

917
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:34,140
The note was,
"We love the routine, Mr. Koy,

918
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,060
but can you drop the joke
with the accent?"

919
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,479
And I didn't understand that.

920
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,357
I was a little taken aback.
I was like, "What the fuck?"

921
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,609
"You mean the joke about my mom?"

922
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,612
"Because the joke isn't her accent."

923
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:50,031
"The joke is about a mom being a mom."

924
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:54,744
"She speaks English. She lives in America.
And she watches your show."

925
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:58,248
"But you don't want her voice to be heard
on that show?"

926
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:01,835
Taken aback. That's 2016.

927
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,712
That's when that happened.
All I wanted to know is,

928
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,172
this is what I said to myself,

929
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,842
did Jeff Foxworthy get the same note?

930
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:16,599
And I'm not dissing Jeff Foxworthy.
I love Jeff Foxworthy!

931
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:20,645
But did he get the same note?
Because he has an accent.

932
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:23,189
He's American. He speaks English.

933
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,151
But I don't know the difference
between Jeff Foxworthy going,

934
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,319
"Hey, what would y'all like
for breakfast?"

935
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,448
Or my mom going, "Hey,
what would you like for breakfast?"

936
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,825
I don't hear anything different
but systemic racism,

937
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:37,328
and that's what I'm saying!
Not all of us get the same...

938
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,338
Not all of us get that...

939
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:04,731
I'm just saying,
not all of us get the same shake.

940
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,400
So just know that.

941
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,153
There's a lot of voices in here
that need to be heard.

942
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:13,448
A lot of us. There's a lot of us.

943
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,576
And I'm glad I did that.

944
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:20,580
Because after that, I got
the next special. I got Comin' in Hot.

945
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,703
"Where do you want to go?"
"I want to go to Hawaii."

946
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,212
"I want to show more about us Filipinos
and other cultures on top of that."

947
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,840
"Where do you want to go for the third
one?" "Let me go to the Philippines."

948
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,676
It wasn't even a special!

949
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,556
"I just want to do one thing
where I can donate an hour,

950
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,976
an hour of air time,
dedicated to my mom's culture."

951
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,747
"I've been talking about it
and making jokes and having fun with it."

952
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,899
"But now let me show the world
what Filipinos look like,

953
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,859
what Filipinos eat,

954
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:54,197
what the Philippines looks like."

955
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,157
I wanted to give Filipinos an opportunity,

956
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,427
because I knew how hard it was for me
to get through the door,

957
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,491
so now I'm going to do it.

958
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:03,122
I'm going to help Filipinos that live
in the Philippines get some limelight.

959
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,850
I'm going to help some Filipinos
that live in America

960
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,835
to go to the Philippines
and show their talent.

961
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,629
That's all I want to do.

962
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,382
Because that's what Filipinos do.
When one gets through the door,

963
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,342
we let all of them
go through the fucking door.

964
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:21,641
Look at us!

965
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,060
Look at us!

966
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,106
We're all laughing at the same shit!

967
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,317
Turn the lights off
and we're all the same color.

968
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,279
But when we turn the lights on,
all of a sudden, we separate ourselves,

969
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:37,198
and that shit is ignorant,
so fucking stop.

970
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,741
That's all.

971
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,871
I'm glad I got to shoot that there.

972
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,291
I'm glad I went to the Philippines
and shot that.

973
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,084
I'm glad I got to dedicate one hour,

974
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,462
so that way people can see
how beautiful our food is and our people,

975
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,591
and see that we speak English.
You know how that helps tourism?

976
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,735
There are so many people that I bump into
and they go,

977
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,113
"Oh, we're going to go to Asia,
somewhere in Asia, for a vacation."

978
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:02,557
I'm like, "Go to the Philippines."
"Oh, I don't know. What's that all about?"

979
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,225
But now they know!

980
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,829
They can see that hour and they're like,
"Oh, fuck! Maybe we should go."

981
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,938
"Holy shit! They speak English there?
Let's go!"

982
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,192
You know how dope that is,
to go to the Philippines?

983
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,612
You can get lost in the Philippines
and someone will help.

984
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,406
You can tap anyone on the shoulder

985
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,759
and they will talk to you in English
and get you to where you need.

986
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:23,703
If you go to Korea and get lost in Korea,
guess what?

987
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,997
You're lost in fucking Korea!

988
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:30,501
You're going to be walking around
for an hour looking for Starbucks

989
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,212
and end up in North Korea. You deserve it!

990
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,214
You should've went to the Philippines!

991
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,197
If you get lost in the Philippines
looking for Starbucks,

992
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,266
you can tap anybody. "Excuse me.
Do you know how to get to Starbucks?"

993
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,435
"Do you know how I can get to Starbucks?"
Right away,

994
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,646
"Yes, I can get you to..."

995
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,938
"I love Starbucks! My God!"

996
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:54,025
"My favorite is the Mocha Frappuccino!"

997
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:57,654
"I love Starbucks!"

998
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,783
Now, the directions are going to be weird.

999
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:04,160
They don't have mile markers like we do.

1000
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:07,830
They don't have the same kind of streets.
But they're going to get you there.

1001
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:11,084
There are going to be landmarks, certain
types of roads that will get you there.

1002
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,002
You just have to pay attention!

1003
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,421
"All right. Listen closely, okay?"

1004
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,007
"This is going to get you to Starbucks."

1005
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,926
"What I need you to do..."

1006
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:23,971
"What I need you to do
is go down this gravel road,

1007
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,849
for about, say...

1008
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,476
Three songs."

1009
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,359
"Pick any song, but three of them, max."

1010
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:43,700
"On that third song, look for
a yellow truck with only two wheels."

1011
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:48,538
"When you see that truck with two wheels,
make a left turn."

1012
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:55,878
"Walk down that road, say about...
my God, say... eh...

1013
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:58,297
11 seconds."

1014
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,762
"And right around the 11th second,

1015
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,974
a dog will run past you real fast."

1016
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:11,227
"Follow that dog.
It goes to Starbucks all the time."

1017
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:26,409
I'm friends with Tommy Lee
from Mötley Crüe.

1018
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,664
I don't know if he's here, but...
I don't know.

1019
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,833
But I'll tell you this story.

1020
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:37,253
And the reason I'm telling you this story
is because when In His Elements came out,

1021
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:41,048
my special from the Philippines,
he calls me.

1022
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,676
And this is what Tommy says to me.
He was like this.

1023
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,219
"Hey, bro."

1024
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,723
"I just watched In His Elements,

1025
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:51,392
and I just want you to know,
it was fucking rad."

1026
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,772
Don't ask me why Tommy Lee sounds
like Keanu Reeves

1027
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,024
from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.

1028
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:03,070
That's just how Tommy talks,
and I love it.

1029
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,489
"Hey, bro."

1030
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,867
"I just want you to know I saw
In His Elements. It was fucking rad."

1031
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,661
I go, "Thanks, Tommy."
"Yeah, no problem, Jo."

1032
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,872
"But I just wanted to...

1033
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,957
I just want to ask you a quick question."

1034
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,585
I go, "What is it, Tommy?" He goes, "Um,

1035
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,463
when you were telling your jokes,

1036
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:25,551
did you have to tell them when to laugh,
or when to clap?"

1037
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,931
I go, "No, Tommy.
They speak fluent English

1038
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:34,101
in the Philippines,
and they love American entertainment."

1039
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,521
"They got all the jokes."
"No shit?" "Yeah!"

1040
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:38,314
"Oh. That's fucking rad!"

1041
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:45,655
I go, "Tommy, Mötley Crüe has been
touring the world for over 45 years."

1042
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,990
"You guys never went to the Philippines?"

1043
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,700
"Not once."

1044
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:53,746
I go, "Why not?"
"Didn't think they'd understand us."

1045
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:59,836
I go, "Tommy,
not only would they understand you,

1046
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,171
but they sing your songs better than you."

1047
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,265
"Just ask Journey."

1048
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,605
And I know there's people in here going,
"Wait a minute."

1049
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,732
"Steve Perry's Filipino?"

1050
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:26,696
Steve Perry hasn't sung for Journey
for over 40 years!

1051
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,197
The lead singer of Journey

1052
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,450
is a little tiny karaoke king
named Arnel Pineda.

1053
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:36,664
Tiny! He sounds incredible.

1054
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:38,416
Talk about a dream!

1055
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:41,711
Talk about crushing any type of obstacle
in front of him!

1056
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,504
That's the shit right there.

1057
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:46,841
If you want motivation in life,
follow Arnel Pineda.

1058
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:51,470
This guy lives in a third-world country
wanting to be a rock'n'roll star.

1059
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:58,019
I don't want to hear people go, "It's hard
here. The opportunities are hard here."

1060
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,562
Follow that!

1061
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,005
Follow that blueprint right there!

1062
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,483
I'm not saying... Hey, look. I know it's
hard for all of us. But I'm just saying,

1063
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,028
that's a fucking incredible story.

1064
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:11,741
I want to make a made-for-TV movie.

1065
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:14,493
I want to write, like, a four-part series
and sell it to Netflix,

1066
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,579
and you better fucking buy it this time!

1067
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:23,294
Because I'm going to win an Emmy!

1068
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,338
I'm going to win an Emmy for it!

1069
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:30,968
I'm going to win an Emmy!

1070
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,512
And I already know the scene
that's going to win me that Emmy,

1071
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,807
because I'm going to write it.
It's going to be brilliant.

1072
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:40,019
Just Arnel singing his ass off
at a karaoke club.

1073
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,647
Then his mom walks in. "Arnel!"

1074
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,566
"What are you doing here,

1075
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,736
singing and dancing like that?

1076
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:50,821
You should be in nursing school!"

1077
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:58,454
"But Mother, I do not want to be a nurse!"

1078
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,957
"I want to be a rock'n'roll star!"

1079
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,834
"You cannot be a rock'n'roll star!
You're Filipino!"

1080
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:08,381
"There's nurses in this family, huh?"

1081
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:09,566
"None of us are rock 'n' roll stars!"

1082
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:12,760
"But I am the only one blessed
with a beautiful voice,

1083
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:15,846
and I want to pursue my dream,
as a rock 'n' roll star!"

1084
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,556
"You cannot be a rock 'n' roll star!"

1085
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,910
"You're going to be a nurse,
like the rest of us in this family!"

1086
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,245
"I don't want to be a nurse!"
"You're going to be a nurse!"

1087
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:23,413
"I don't want to be a nurse!"

1088
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:25,439
"You're going to be a nurse!"

1089
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:28,109
And then his father walks in.

1090
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:31,946
"Okay, all right, all right.
Enough of all this bickering."

1091
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,328
"Sorry I'm late, Arnel."

1092
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,416
"I was giving someone
directions to Starbucks."

1093
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,256
"Honey,

1094
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,134
if Arnel wants to be a rock 'n' roll star,

1095
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:56,012
my God, let him be a rock 'n' roll star!"

1096
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,390
"We have enough nurses in this family."

1097
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:04,979
"But I'm just concerned for him,
after I leave this earth!"

1098
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:08,441
"I might have not done my job as a mother,

1099
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:12,737
because I didn't guide my son
in the right direction."

1100
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:17,575
"Now he doesn't have benefits
or anything."

1101
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,453
"Stop it. My God."

1102
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,291
"Let him pursue his dream.
He has a beautiful voice!"

1103
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,044
"And if anything happens to him
when we are gone,

1104
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,880
we have plenty of nurses in this family."

1105
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,924
"So what do you say, honey?"

1106
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:37,178
"Let him pursue his dream. Come on!"

1107
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,180
"You are right."

1108
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:41,807
"Arnel,

1109
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:46,187
pursue your dream
and be a rock 'n' roll star."

1110
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:49,774
"Thank you, Mother. Thank you so much."

1111
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,735
"There you have it."

1112
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:56,030
"Your mother and I are giving you
our blessings."

1113
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,199
"Now, Arnel, pursue your dream."

1114
01:07:58,282 --> 01:07:59,492
"Thank you, Father."

1115
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,118
"You're welcome, son."

1116
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:04,121
"Now get up on that stage
and show us what you've got."

1117
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,915
"I will, Father."

1118
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:08,542
"Arnel!" "Yes, Father?"

1119
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,627
"Arnel,

1120
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:13,130
just promise me one thing
when you pursue your dream."

1121
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,715
"What is it, Father?"

1122
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,887
"Don't stop believin'."

1123
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:35,027
That's an Emmy! Say that's not an Emmy!

1124
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,739
That's a fucking great Emmy,
and I better get one for it!

1125
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:41,492
I mean, what did we learn from that story?

1126
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:46,122
One, pursue your dream, no matter
how hard or what the boundaries are.

1127
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,833
Conquer all and you can make it!
That's a beautiful story.

1128
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:53,337
But on the other note, what a beautiful
love story between the parents,

1129
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,215
to talk it out!

1130
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:58,425
That's the key to a great relationship.

1131
01:08:58,509 --> 01:08:59,677
We'll learn that,

1132
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,138
that if you talk it out, things will work.

1133
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:05,182
If you talk,
that's the key to a relationship.

1134
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:08,769
And that's another thing we're going
to learn from this fucking movie.

1135
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:14,567
Look at all the relationships that end
because no one talks!

1136
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:18,487
They hate to talk, and when you don't
talk, that's when a relationship ends.

1137
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:21,657
And you know who hates talking? Guys!

1138
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:23,868
Because women love to talk.

1139
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,496
Just talk!

1140
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:31,208
And if you don't want to talk to her
at that moment, then talk to somebody.

1141
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:32,459
Not everybody.

1142
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,629
Don't talk to your best friend.
That's going to end the relationship too.

1143
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,799
Your best friend hated her.

1144
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,260
He's been waiting for you to break up.

1145
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:45,431
"You're not goin' believe what she did."
"I know. You don't have to tell me shit."

1146
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:49,476
"She's always been that way, dude!"

1147
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:53,606
What kind of advice is that?
"She's always been that way, dude!"

1148
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,442
"I didn't even tell you."
"You don't fucking need to, bro!"

1149
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,197
Don't listen to that guy.
Get the fuck away from him.

1150
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,534
Go to someone that doesn't know
you or her. Get a therapist!

1151
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:09,288
Pay for it! One hundred and ten dollars
for the hour.

1152
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:13,626
Let that doctor figure it out.
Why, you'll enjoy it too.

1153
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:16,295
Walk into that room. Every guy
will enjoy that 110 bucks. "Here."

1154
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,714
"Listen to what this bitch did."

1155
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:26,305
An hour, you just talk.

1156
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:28,057
Then your doctor looks at it and goes,

1157
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,726
"All right. I looked at everything, and,

1158
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:31,936
you're wrong."

1159
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:35,564
"Now go home and apologize."

1160
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,359
"Okay. Thank you."

1161
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:41,320
That's what therapy does!

1162
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,906
That's why when people laugh
at therapy, I get mad.

1163
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:47,034
You need therapy. We all need therapy!

1164
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:50,120
There's nothing wrong with that.
Don't be embarrassed of that shit.

1165
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:54,208
And don't laugh at someone when they say
they're going to therapy.

1166
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,126
"Oh, he's going to therapy?
He must be crazy!"

1167
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,920
That's fucked up!

1168
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,839
No one's crazy for getting therapy!
We're all crazy!

1169
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,425
All of us in here are fucking crazy!

1170
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,887
You're crazy, you're crazy,
you're crazy, you're crazy.

1171
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:10,307
We're all fucking crazy!
Don't act like you're not crazy.

1172
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:13,560
You ever walk by yourself down the street
and look across the street

1173
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,397
and see another person walking
by themselves, talking to themselves?

1174
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,901
You say this to yourself: "Look at that
crazy motherfucker talking to himself!"

1175
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:23,988
Who the fuck are you talking to?

1176
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,324
You're walking by yourself

1177
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:31,787
and you told yourself to look
at something you're already looking at!

1178
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,206
You crazy motherfucker!

1179
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:42,506
Talk! It feels good! Work it out. Talk!

1180
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:45,509
Guys hate it, though.
We'll fucking fight to the end.

1181
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:48,137
"Are you going to talk to me or what?"

1182
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,557
"No. You know what happened.
You're just acting like you don't know."

1183
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:55,036
"Now you're trying to make me say.
You know what the fuck you did."

1184
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:58,731
"No, I don't know what the fuck I did!
That's why I'm asking you!"

1185
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:02,359
"Well, if you have to ask me,
then fuck it. Nothing happened."

1186
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,236
"Nothing fucking happened!"

1187
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,116
"I'm just mad for no fucking reason!"

1188
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,909
"I just chose to be fucking mad!"

1189
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,912
"Oh, my God. You're fucking crazy!"

1190
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,956
"You're fucking crazy!"
"No, you're crazy!"

1191
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,002
"No, you're crazy!
I'm trying to talk to you like an adult."

1192
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,022
"If you don't say anything,
then I'm not going to know."

1193
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,214
"So tell me, what the fuck did I do?"

1194
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:27,092
"If you don't know, then fuck it."
"Oh, my God!"

1195
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,510
"Just tell me something!"

1196
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,780
"Oh, are you going to act like this?"
"Yeah! Just tell me."

1197
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:33,825
"So you really want to know? You really
want to know what the fuck happened?"

1198
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,809
"Yeah, I want to know."
"You really want to know?"

1199
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:39,396
"Yes! Tell me! Tell me, baby. What?"

1200
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,358
"What the fuck did I do? What?"

1201
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,155
"When he said I was sucking ghost dick,
and everyone was laughing,

1202
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:51,158
and you didn't say anything!
I don't suck ghost dick, bitch!"

1203
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:53,494
"I don't suck ghost dick, bitch!"

1204
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,247
I love you guys. Thank you so much, guys.

1205
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:01,585
Los Angeles, California!

1206
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:07,883
Give it up one more time for Jo Koy!

1207
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:36,578
I've got to share this moment
with my one-and-only right now,

1208
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,914
my son! Bring my son out real quick.

1209
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:45,087
We lived right down the street
when I was working at Nordstrom Rack.

1210
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,423
This right here is my right hand!

1211
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:21,999
