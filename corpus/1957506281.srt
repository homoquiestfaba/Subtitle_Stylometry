speaking to you live from
the courthouse in redwood city.

7
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,162
In December of 1969,

8
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,464
a groundskeeper
making his usual rounds

9
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,267
discovered the body of
8-year-old Susan Nason

10
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,436
in a litter-strewn ravine

11
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,338
Mr. and Mrs. Nason,
parents of the murdered child,

12
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,749
have just entered
the courtroom now.

13
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,743
We can only wonder at
the thoughts and feelings

14
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,412
That they will
re-living here today.

15
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,323
Since his arrest, the accused,
George Franklin, sr., 51,

16
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,759
a retired firefighter
and a father of five,

17
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,494
has trimmed his hair

18
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,330
And how wears
steel-rimmed glasses.

19
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,732
His accuser is his own daughter,

20
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,368
Eileen Franklin-Lipsker,

21
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,737
who will testify today.

22
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:49,609
Judge: The record will reflect
the presence of the jury...

23
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,744
The defendant with counsel.

24
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,214
The people are represented.

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,749
Miss tipton, you may
call your first witness.

26
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,618
Tipton: Thank you, your honor.

27
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,221
I'd like to call Eileen
Franklin-Lipsker.

28
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,223
That's hyphen Lipsker.

29
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,664
State your name, and spell
your first and last names.

00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,772
Do you swear to
tell the whole truth

34
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,774
and nothing but the
truth, so help you god?

35
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,510
- Yes.
- Thank you.

36
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,512
Have a seat, please.

37
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,380
Judge: Miss Lipsker,
please try to stay

38
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,516
as close to the microphone
as is comfortable...

39
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,651
It doesn't pick up that well.

40
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,354
Okay. Thank you.

41
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,923
( Sighs )

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,658
Good morning, Eileen.

43
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,928
- Good morning.
- Will you tell the court where you reside?

44
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,831
We did live in Los Angeles.

45
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,833
But my husband's
computer business

46
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,569
Made it necessary for
us to move to Switzerland.

47
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,805
And the actual business that
your husband performs is what?

48
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,942
Consulting on mainframe
computer systems.

49
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:01,548
Okay. And that's the
primary reason for your move?

50
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,284
Yes. And we felt
that it would be

51
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,820
A healthy, safe place
to raise our children.

52
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,656
Mm-hmm.

53
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,927
Now, can you
identify the defendant?

54
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,831
He's sitting over there

55
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:22,435
in a dark suit
with a striped tie.

56
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,305
And what is your
relationship to the defendant?

57
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,707
He's my father.

58
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,710
How would you describe your
relationship to the defendant

59
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,546
while you were growing up?

60
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,687
I was his favorite.

61
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,593
And can you tell us when the
memories involving your father

62
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,328
Began to come back?

63
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:53,333
At first they were pictures
I didn't understand.

64
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,469
They started when we
still lived in Los Angeles

65
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,605
some two years ago...

66
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,873
Eileen: So how long will
you be up in San Francisco?

67
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,609
Woman: Just the weekend.

68
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,612
I'm not really sure I
want the family to know

69
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:06,822
I'm gonna be in
the area, though.

70
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,749
Oh, don't worry.
We hardly ever talk.

71
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:14,654
I did go up, though, for my
ten-year high school reunion.

72
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,489
You're kidding.

73
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,625
I didn't see the family.

74
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,028
So did you go by the house
or the neighborhood or...

75
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,397
No. I didn't want to.

76
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,798
Girl: Mommy, mommy! Look!

77
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,768
- I left my cigarettes in the car.
- You should quit.

78
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,037
Mommy, watch me!
Come here! Come here!

79
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,639
Okay.

80
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,507
- Are you ready?
- Uh-huh.

81
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,126
Here comes sica the acrobat!

82
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:37,677
Oh! Good!

83
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,696
Mommy, I want to come down.

84
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,648
Okay. Put your legs around here.

85
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,283
Thatta boy. Down you go.

86
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,052
Good! Want to do it again?

87
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,720
- Yeah!
- Okay, go around there.

88
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,760
Sica?

89
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,030
Sica!

90
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,502
( Panicky ) Sica?!

91
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,804
Sica!

92
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,376
Sica!

93
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,447
Sica! Sica!!!

94
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,815
Mommy, mommy!

95
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,417
Here I am!

96
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,453
Don't you ever, ever
run off like that again!

97
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,122
Do you understand me?!

98
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:23,723
( Giggling ) How can I hide?

99
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,827
Stop it. Stop it!
Stop it, both of you!

100
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,096
Please stay where I can see you!

101
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,698
Settle down, settle down.

102
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,834
Let's go get a drink
at the table. Go ahead.

103
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,704
What frightened you so much?

104
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,706
( Deep sigh )

105
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,542
I overreacted.

106
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,680
( Typing )

107
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,534
Mmm...

108
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,635
Hmm.

109
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,140
( Typing )

110
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,143
Are you taping that
tennis match for me?

111
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,512
Oh... i forgot.

112
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,981
Eileen, for Pete's sake!

113
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,889
( Chuckles )

114
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,058
I could have yelled "fire."

115
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,494
I think that's a
federal offense.

116
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,530
You've already worked
a zillion hours this week.

117
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,800
And I have to work a zillion
more until I finish this job.

118
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,668
I just need a little more time.

119
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,072
- As soon as we get to...
- Get to Switzerland, blah, blah, blah.

120
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,610
I miss my husband, Barry.

121
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,955
Aaah!

122
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,977
Are you okay?

123
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:42,161
( Gasps )

124
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,968
Yes.

125
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,673
Careful. I'll do that. You
get Aaron back to bed.

126
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,242
Right.

127
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,279
Right. Bye.

128
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,115
That was Barry.
Something came up at work.

129
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,619
My phantom husband.

130
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,121
He says he's very sorry.

131
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:49,295
Why don't we take the time to
examine your childhood a little more?

132
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,298
I'm glad it's over.

133
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,068
Maybe we should
just forget it and go on.

134
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,770
Where would you like to go?

135
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:10,783
Sica hid in the park the
other day, and I was terrified.

136
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,318
Of what?

137
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,786
I don't know.

138
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,789
It was a... a
beautiful, sunny day,

139
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,791
And I went ice cold.

140
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,693
What did you think
would happen to her?

141
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,062
Something horrible.

142
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,666
I don't know why, but
that's what I'm afraid of.

143
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,635
Something really terrible.

144
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,673
Are you okay?

145
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,808
( Sighs ) How can I be okay

146
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:40,046
When I'm married to a man who
works all the time and doesn't see me?

147
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,715
Well, I see you now.
That's why I asked.

148
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,351
You seem jumpy and nervous.

149
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,320
I'm worried.

150
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,757
You ask, but you want me to
answer "yes, I'm fine." So yes, I'm fine.

151
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,827
No, what I want you to
answer is what's going on.

152
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,863
Are you sorry we're
moving to Switzerland?

153
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,100
No. I can hardly wait.

154
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,836
You'll turn into this
wonderfully relaxed person

155
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,974
And we'll have two-hour
lunches and take the kids on hikes.

156
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,676
And what will you turn into?

157
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,847
Oh, Barry.

158
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,383
You must have had a
good session with Evan.

159
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,087
Does this mean I don't have
to go back to therapy with you?

160
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:27,259
You're a brilliant man
and a terrific father.

161
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,830
And when I married you, I
thought I turned my life around.

162
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,368
So why isn't everything perfect?

163
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,273
Everyone's question, huh?

164
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,708
Come on.

165
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:10,269
( Both laughing )

166
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,880
Mom?

167
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,316
( Groans )

168
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,786
What was your mother's response?

169
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,790
She saw us, and went
out and closed the door.

170
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,508
Did you try and tell her?

171
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:34,160
Later.

172
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:37,229
I said, "he hurt me."

173
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,833
And she looked at
me and said I was fine.

174
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,035
How old were you?

175
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,177
Maybe around six or seven.

176
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:57,049
How has your father
been with your children?

177
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:06,092
We haven't seen him
in about four years.

178
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,828
Any reason for that?

179
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:14,834
Once I walked in and he
was holding sica on his lap.

180
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,002
And I didn't know
why at the time,

181
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,239
But I grabbed her and
I asked him to leave.

182
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,810
I was frightened and angry.

183
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,381
What happened then?

184
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:33,152
I remember how he looked at me.

185
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:37,123
As if he knew...
Even though I didn't.

186
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:43,395
He never came over again.

187
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,532
He sent cards for birthdays.

188
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:54,006
How is it humanly possible to
suddenly remember these things?

189
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,543
Things I never even
knew happened?

190
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,147
It could be a
protective reaction

191
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,416
to repress something that was...

192
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,886
overwhelming you

193
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,289
or it put you in danger.

194
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,642
Then you believe me?

195
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:14,927
Of course I believe you.

196
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,429
Oh, man, I missed it!

197
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,899
Okay, guys. Come on. Bed.

198
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,934
Give me the ball.

199
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,803
Come on. No... Give me the ball.

200
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,888
Darn it!

201
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:26,906
It's bedtime.

202
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,474
Oh, just one more.

203
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,909
Sica.

204
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,810
- Can we watch a cartoon?
- Come on.

205
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,289
- But there's no school tomorrow.
- You can look at picture books.

206
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,048
- Let's go.
- Eileen: In bed.

207
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,533
But it's still light out.

208
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:38,951
It's still bedtime.

209
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,056
Isn't anybody coming up?

210
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,559
Doesn't somebody always come up?

211
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,526
Hey.

212
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,066
Ahhh. You want
me to lift you up?

213
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,101
( Chuckles ) Come on.

214
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,070
I'll help you clean
up the dishes.

215
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,239
- Stay out a little while with me.
- I can't.

216
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,309
I have hours of work
to do before I go to bed.

217
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,614
I really do.

218
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,584
It's the only way I was
able to come home early.

219
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,593
You go on. I'll clean up.

220
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,646
Mommy?

221
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,982
Well, hello.

222
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,985
Oh, my sleepy boy.
How was your nap?

223
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,786
Fine.

224
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,521
How about some time with mom?

225
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,956
Like a book, maybe?

226
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,324
Okay.

227
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,164
Are you and Kristen
having fun, sica?

228
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,167
Kristen likes to
color too, mommy.

229
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,371
Well, that's nice. Huh, Kristen?

230
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,508
Okay.

231
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:12,995
"A."

232
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,013
Uh-huh.

233
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,281
"Apple."

234
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,917
Yeah. Have you
read this book before?

235
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,420
"Ant." that's an ant, yes.

236
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,522
Is there an uncle here?

237
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,936
( Screams )

238
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,039
Aaron: "B."

239
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,009
"Bubble."

240
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,553
Barry: That's so pretty.
What a beautiful family.

241
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,257
Eileen: Because it's yours, dad.

242
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,259
No, because it's yours.

243
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,527
Don't get too close.

244
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,438
I can't make you into a
movie star if you get too close.

245
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,397
Oh.

246
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,399
Alright, okay.

247
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,702
So we're gonna
go across the bridge

248
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,670
and then up the hill, okay?

249
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,406
Sica: Is there hills like
this ins Switzerland?

250
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,043
Oh, bigger. Bigger
hills. And much higher.

251
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,045
Really? How high?

252
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,313
Higher than this?

253
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,716
Oh, way higher, way higher.

254
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,584
With lots and lots of snow.

255
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,287
- You can make a snowman every day.
- Yay!

256
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:32,024
Dad, can we go throw
rocks at the frogs?

257
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,692
Well, the frogs are pretty fast.

258
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,759
You might not get 'em.

259
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,428
Just throw rocks.
Not at the frogs.

260
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,063
Okay!

261
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,000
Barry, come on. Take a shot.

262
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,040
Whoa, look at that one!
Come on, daddy, come on!

263
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,575
What are we doin'?

264
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,410
Sica: Up there!

265
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,280
Pretty neat, huh?

266
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,151
What you got on your face?

267
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,170
Sica: Mommy! Come on, mom!

268
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,075
Up! Up! There.

269
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,177
Dad, look at this!

270
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,055
Mommy!

271
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,523
Eileen! Are you all right?

272
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,192
You okay?

273
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,560
Oh, that was so dumb.

274
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,129
Sica: Did you skin your knees?

275
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,266
No. I don't even get
to wear a band-aid.

276
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,234
See? I'm fine.

277
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,171
I'm fine.

278
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,643
Come on, let's go.

279
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:09,121
Barry, when you do something new

280
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,423
and you don't know
how it's going to work out,

281
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,126
Does it scare you?

282
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,261
Why should it scare me?

283
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:19,231
Because you don't
know what can happen.

284
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,570
How do you know
you can handle it?

285
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,805
I just know.

286
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,862
- ( Gasps )
- What's wrong?

287
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,130
Ohh...

288
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,334
Eileen?

289
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,802
( Groaning )

290
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,442
Eileen, what is it? What is it?

291
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,644
- What is it? What's wrong?
- No...

292
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,796
Eileen!

293
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:07,880
No, no...

294
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,481
Daddy!

295
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,666
What's happening?

296
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:11,783
Aaah!

297
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,289
Eileen!

298
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,076
( Whimpering )

299
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,194
My god.

300
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,196
What happened?

301
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,332
Eileen, what did I do?

302
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,768
( Crying )

303
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,236
What's wrong?

304
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,305
Talk to me. What happened?

305
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,209
These...

306
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,878
These pictures...

307
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,347
Started coming back to me.

308
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,183
Pictures? What pictures?

309
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,257
Of me and my father.

310
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:59,765
When... when I
was a little girl.

311
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,869
There was a room.

312
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,378
My father let a man rape me.

313
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,647
He... he...

314
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,249
He what?

315
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,285
He let a man rape me.

316
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:21,253
Oh, my god.

317
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,524
Why... why didn't
you ever tell me?

318
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,926
I never remembered.

319
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,995
Until lately.

320
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,265
How old were you?

321
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,803
Eight or nine.

322
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,771
Ohh...

323
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:45,544
it's so real right now
I can feel the pain,

324
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,796
how helpless i...

325
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:47,980
No.

326
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,549
No, you're not helpless now.

327
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,385
And I'll take care of you.

328
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,957
You're not disgusted with me?

329
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,928
Oh, Eileen. You
didn't do anything.

330
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,938
There's more.

331
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,010
But I can't talk about it now.

332
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,845
It's okay.

333
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,282
It's okay.

334
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,955
Come on. Let's
get you back to bed.

335
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,326
No. You go.

336
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,596
No. I'm not leaving
you sitting here.

337
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,464
I won't.

338
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:43,468
I'll go downstairs
and... Make some tea.

339
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,015
No. Please. I need to be alone.

340
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,628
I'd like to kill your father.

341
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,764
Throw him in jail.

342
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,867
Make the son-of-a-bitch pay.

343
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,859
Eileen: Mother.

344
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,996
For once will you
really talk to me?

345
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:23,135
I remember beatings and
shouting and awful scenes.

346
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,570
What I don't remember is you.

347
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,973
I was the fat lady
in the muu-muu.

348
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,446
Do you remember once I was in
the tub with daddy and I yelled?

349
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,115
And you looked in, and then
you left and shut the door?

350
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,117
I don't remember
anything like that.

351
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,454
No?! You were
there, weren't you?

352
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,123
Oh, yes. For more years
than I care to remember.

353
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,893
Why didn't you protect me?

354
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,996
I didn't see anything
to protect you from.

355
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,898
I don't believe that.

356
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,600
I was struggling to
survive in those days.

357
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,736
You can't imagine
what my life was like.

358
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,906
You were my
mother. I was a child.

359
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,542
You were supposed
to take care of us.

360
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,511
I couldn't take care of myself.

361
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:10,148
I know that doesn't
change anything.

362
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:14,486
Except maybe whether or
not Susie nason was murdered.

363
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,621
Susie?

364
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,924
What has this got to with her?

365
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,626
Daddy killed her.

366
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,163
Oh, no.

367
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,633
I was there. I saw it.

368
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,869
Oh, dear god.

369
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,909
Why have you
come to me with this?

370
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:42,147
Because you're my
mother. And a lawyer.

371
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,187
I haven't helped you
much as a mother.

372
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:56,661
And you need a criminal lawyer.

373
00:24:56,728 --> 00:25:00,232
You're not shocked, are you?

374
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,201
Mother, please...

375
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,904
Are you?

376
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,542
No.

377
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,645
No, I'm not shocked.

378
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,950
Have you told Barry?

379
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,119
How will you do that?

380
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,122
And how will I tell my husband?

381
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,124
He has no idea what
my first marriage was like.

382
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,302
- Mother...
- Are you going to go to the police with this?

383
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,695
I don't know.

384
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,565
I want to do the right thing.

385
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,936
I owe something
to Susie, don't I?

386
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,806
Don't I?

387
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:46,945
You didn't come just
to see the baby's room.

388
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,717
I want to tell you
some things about dad,

389
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,586
Some things I've
been remembering.

390
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,855
Look, I haven't
seen him for years.

391
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,990
Okay.

392
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,127
Then tell me what you remember
about when we were kids.

393
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,162
- You were the oldest.
- Not much.

394
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,932
I'm really very vague about
growing up until I left home.

395
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:11,903
Me, too. Why, Kate?
We are we all so vague?

396
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,874
What difference does it make?
That part of our lives is over.

397
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:20,011
Besides, we're both married now.

398
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,147
Don't turn away.

399
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:25,283
Whatever you're trying to do...

400
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,719
You leave me out of it.

401
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:36,161
Eileen: Somehow
he could control me.

402
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:40,165
But Susie would go home
and tell what he did to her.

403
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,167
He had to kill her.

404
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,336
Why didn't he kill you, too?

405
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:48,206
Sometimes I wish he had.

406
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,742
You're lying.

407
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,345
- Janice: Mom believed her, George.
- Well, sure. She hates him.

408
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:56,648
I don't. I loved him.

409
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,917
And I love you,
you're my only brother.

410
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,186
Then why are you
ganging up on him?

411
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,321
He doesn't stand a chance.

412
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,539
Did Susie?

413
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,690
Did you?

414
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:09,194
When he used to beat you till you
were black and blue, we stood up for you.

415
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,163
If... if this thing happened,

416
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,033
why didn't you tell right
away when you got home?

417
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,202
I don't know. I was too scared.

418
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,237
Unbelievable. He's our father.

419
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,206
Right.

420
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,875
So how come none
of us ever see him?

421
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,877
Haven't for years?

422
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:31,149
We don't talk about when we were
kids. Why not? Isn't that strange?

423
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,119
What's strange is you
and your sudden memory.

424
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:37,422
All these years and suddenly you
start making these crazy accusations.

425
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,792
I was there. I saw it.

426
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,730
This is sick.

427
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:50,368
It's true, Georgie.
I tried to stop it.

428
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,370
I didn't want to remember.

429
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,705
Look, I'm warning you.

430
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,074
Don't start anything
you can't control.

431
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,077
You're gonna mess
up everyone's life.

432
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,717
I don't want to mess
up everyone's life.

433
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,269
I don't know what to do.

434
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,753
Does Barry know?

435
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,890
Not about the murder.

436
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:15,393
About... some other things.

437
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,734
You, too?

438
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,871
Oh, Jannie.

439
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,774
Why didn't you ever tell
the things he did to you?

440
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:30,841
I couldn't.

441
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,456
I always thought that
you were the lucky one.

442
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,716
That it was different for you.

443
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,155
Barry: There you go.

444
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,157
Hold on, I'm gonna get Aaron.

445
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,759
Hold on.

446
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,294
Okay, buddy, it's your turn.

447
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,895
There we go.

448
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,897
How about on this big one here?

449
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,100
There you go.

450
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,068
Ride 'em, cowboy.

451
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,007
Aaron: Mommy, look at
me! I'm the lone ranger!

452
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,316
Barry.

453
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:16,788
I didn't tell you
everything the other night.

454
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,191
You mean about your dad.

455
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:28,032
And about Susie. She
was my closest friend.

456
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,236
He molested her, too?

457
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:34,839
Barry, he murdered her.

458
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,342
I saw him do it.

459
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,479
You... you actually...

460
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:47,218
You actually saw him kill her?

461
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:52,190
She was... Sitting
on, like, a little hill.

462
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,061
And she looked at me for
help, and I couldn't save her.

463
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,899
Uhh...

464
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,368
What made you
remember after all this time?

465
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,103
I don't know.

466
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,106
Sica, I think.

467
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:12,210
Lately she reminds
me so much of Susie.

468
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,148
Ohh.

469
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:20,151
We've gotta talk to the police.

470
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,187
They won't believe me.

471
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:26,858
He shouldn't be out there wandering
around free. He's a murderer.

472
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:31,262
Eileen, it's wrong to
withhold this information.

473
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,299
We've gotta call the d.A.'S
office as soon as we get home.

474
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:37,268
I don't want the
kids to ever know

475
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,946
the awful things their
grandfather did to me.

476
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,272
I'd feel so ashamed!

477
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,909
It's his shame. It's not yours.

478
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:48,413
Eileen, the man is a monster.

479
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:52,884
Sica: Monster? Here
comes a monster!

480
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,118
Come here.

481
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,926
Go on. Call them.

482
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,201
All right.

483
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,570
Here she is.

484
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,573
She's gonna talk
to you right now.

485
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,276
You tell us if
there's any evidence.

486
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,416
Barry: Here she is.

487
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:35,627
Eileen: It was in foster city.

488
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,496
Her name is Susan nason.

489
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,232
N-a-s-o-n.

490
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,102
And how old was Susan
when this happened?

491
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,471
Eight or nine.

492
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,507
Let me think just
a minute, okay?

493
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:54,479
It's my guess it
happened in the fall, in '69.

494
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,982
All right. Why don't you just go
ahead and tell us what happened?

495
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,352
Well, can't you just look
and see if something is there?

496
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,489
I don't have access
to the files right here.

497
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,624
Your husband said you
would give us the details.

498
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:10,628
Why did you tell
them I'd give details?

499
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:14,132
Not a lot, just enough to
put two and two together.

500
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,668
They're asking
specific questions!

501
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,137
Barry: Well, he needs something.

502
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:22,440
This was a major crime.

503
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,509
Are you listening
to all of this?

504
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,514
Ma'am, we're with you.

505
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,551
Why don't you just
give us a brief rundown?

506
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,462
We'll find the files and
see if they correspond.

507
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:38,122
How would that be?

508
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,391
Eileen: ( Sighs ) Fine.

509
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,630
Okay.

510
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:52,670
I was in the car with the
person who committed the crime.

511
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:56,040
Cop: This was in foster city?

512
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,442
Uh-huh.

513
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:01,479
We went to the woods...

514
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:05,183
This is really hard.

515
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,587
( Exhales )

516
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:15,159
After that, somehow he
took Susie out of the car.

517
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:19,997
She looked up at me for help.

518
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:26,571
I saw him raise his arms and...

519
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:29,574
I looked away, down at her hand.

520
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,177
And that's when I
saw the crushed ring.

521
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:36,447
Isn't that enough?

522
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,452
How did you come to be
in his car to begin with?

523
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,455
Um...

524
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:50,194
Because it was...
A person I knew.

525
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,336
Do you remember if it
was raining that day?

526
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,606
No. It... It wasn't
raining that day.

527
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,741
It was really...

528
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:08,713
It was a really
pleasant, nice day.

529
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,259
I probably should
have told you this.

530
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,795
I went to the police, too.

531
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,397
About Susie? When?

532
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,132
About seven years ago.

533
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,767
Why, Jannie?

534
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,681
I was talking to my roommate and I was
remembering the night that Susie disappeared.

535
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:38,776
And I remembered that
dad was acting so strange.

536
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:42,146
And you were so scared.

537
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,515
The police came, didn't they?

538
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,117
Yeah.

539
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:49,520
You didn't come down.
You stayed in your room.

540
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,290
I remember that, um,

541
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,392
when I came back
in to talk to them,

542
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,795
as I was walking
through the door...

543
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,498
Dad kicked me real
hard right in the back.

544
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,809
Do you think he was
trying to frighten you

545
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,586
So you wouldn't
tell them anything?

546
00:35:04,587 --> 00:35:07,338
It's what I think now.

547
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,653
I remember that I went up to your
room and I got into bed with you

548
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:16,714
and you were...
Shivering and soaked.

549
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,383
When you went to the
police, what did they tell you?

550
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,421
Patted me on the head,
told me I should go home.

551
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,756
Oh, Jannie, they'll
never believe me, either.

552
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:29,660
No, no, it's different
for you. You were there.

553
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,476
Barry: Go ahead, Eileen.
Just call the d.A.'S office.

554
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,783
If they have nothing, at least
we've done the right thing.

555
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,381
Maybe I should have
asked Susie's parents.

556
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,848
Wouldn't you want
to know the truth?

557
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,928
To know that the person
responsible is finally put away?

558
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:58,756
The person responsible?
Barry, it's my father.

559
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,360
( Sighs )

560
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,162
( Touchtones beeping )

561
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,339
Cop #2: We were
waiting for you to call back.

562
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,476
Uh, we seldom get this excited

563
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,344
about a case.

564
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,680
You're not the person
I spoke with before.

565
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:23,915
Who is this?

566
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,417
Detective sergeant Robert Morse.

567
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,570
I'd like to interview you.

568
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:30,655
I live in L.A.

569
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,524
Could we come down this weekend?

570
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,527
Will you be wearing
your uniforms?

571
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,264
I don't want our neighbors seeing
police coming into the house.

572
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:41,899
Understood. No, we're...

573
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:45,236
We're plain-clothes detectives
and we'll be in a rented car.

574
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:47,672
I don't mean to
be rude, it's just...

575
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:51,509
I have this general
mistrust of police officers.

576
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,511
You're in good hands.

577
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,514
We're the guys
in the white hats.

578
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,516
Now...

579
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,485
Can you give me the
name of the suspect?

580
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,824
I have small children.
You're sure he won't know?

581
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,428
Well, not until we're positive
we can prosecute this case.

582
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:14,699
Do you know his
name and whereabouts?

583
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,438
It's, um...

584
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,407
George Franklin, sr.

585
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:26,444
He lives in the Sacramento area.

586
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,778
And your name?

587
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,683
Eileen Franklin-Lipsker.

588
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,686
Did you say Franklin?

589
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,522
Yes. It's my father.

590
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,661
( School bell rings )

591
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,442
Aaaaaah!

592
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,494
Mommy! Mommy!

593
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,595
Aaaah!

594
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,764
( Gasping )

595
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,866
Eileen, it's okay.
It's me, it's Barry.

596
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,301
Aaron: Mommy! Mommy!

597
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,570
Mom!

598
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,474
There's my boy.

599
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,817
Look at all the pretty
flowers we picked.

600
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,420
Eileen: Oh, they're beautiful.

601
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,356
Did you leave any outside?

602
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,342
( Kids chatter )

603
00:38:47,343 --> 00:38:49,260
Okay, thank you.

604
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,764
Thank you.

605
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,366
Uh-huh.

606
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,668
( Laughing )

607
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,638
Things don't have
to look perfect.

608
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,773
They have to look right.

609
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,376
They'll be judging everything.

610
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,912
Making assumptions about me. Us.

611
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,681
Did you hear a car?

612
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,417
( Car doors slam )

613
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,272
I'm Eileen Lipsker.

614
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,356
Bob Morse.

615
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:20,991
This is Bryan Cassandro.

616
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,359
How are ya?

617
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:23,561
This is Jessica.

618
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:24,695
Sica.

619
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,830
I'm Aaron.

620
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,565
Hi, Aaron.

621
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:28,199
Barry Lipsker.

622
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,350
Barry.

623
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:30,434
Hi. How are ya?

624
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,937
Come on, kids, let's go.

625
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,114
- Have fun.
- Sica: Bye, mom.

626
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,140
Let's get you to grandma's.

627
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,677
I thought you weren't
gonna wear uniforms.

628
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,816
Is this more like it?

629
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,052
No, that's not right.

630
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,562
Here's the Van.

631
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,732
They were below me.

632
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,467
They were below you?

633
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,002
Yeah.

634
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,738
There was sort of a hill.

635
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,443
Is that important?

636
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,724
Can you remember any
inappropriate action by your father

637
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,994
around the time
of Susan's murder?

638
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,762
I...

639
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,899
I really distanced myself
from everyone after...

640
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:38,135
And yet you stayed
close to your father.

641
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,908
I think it was a way
of my staying safe...

642
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:48,679
To keep myself with him
and close to him, all the time.

643
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:52,149
Now, what about
your parents' marriage?

644
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,485
Would you call it good?

645
00:40:56,253 --> 00:41:00,491
It was terrible. They
fought constantly.

646
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:01,892
Did he beat her?

647
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,093
Yes.

648
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:08,499
Does your father drink a lot?

649
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:09,984
Quite heavily.

650
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:11,402
Any drugs?

651
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,904
Pot, I think.

652
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,073
Besides the murder,

653
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,243
where there other
incidents of sexual abuse

654
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,212
with you or your siblings?

655
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:25,216
Can't we keep my brother
and sisters out of this?

656
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,185
( Timer dings ) Excuse me.

657
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,189
Eileen,

658
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:35,059
what do you think
of your father?

659
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,662
What do I think of him?

660
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,065
I don't know.

661
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,054
He must be very sick.

662
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:49,073
Barry: She loves him.

663
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,809
I don't get it,
but she still does.

664
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,945
He could have killed
me, too. But he didn't.

665
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,582
He didn't have to. He had you under
his thumb just the way he wanted.

666
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,918
What about the time
I had appendicitis?

667
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,854
He was the one who
took me to the hospital.

668
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:07,691
He held my hand when I
was afraid, he saved my life.

669
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,695
Then this is not a vendetta?

670
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,832
How could I want to
send my father to prison?

671
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,834
How? He was a drunk,

672
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,203
He was emotionally
and physically abusive.

673
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,840
Why do you all want
me to hate my father?

674
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,842
I was a funny-looking kid

675
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,578
with huge freckles
and buck teeth.

676
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,614
He told me I was beautiful

677
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,049
and I could be
whatever I wanted.

678
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,652
I loved him.

679
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,253
You know what I say?

680
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,223
I say lock him up and
throw away the key.

681
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,762
What happens now?

682
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,630
We arrest him.

683
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,632
You won't hurt him?

684
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,336
He'll have more protection
than you or Susan ever had.

685
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,905
Sica: Happy birthday, mommy!

686
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,641
Happy birthday! Here I come!

687
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,578
Oh, boy.

688
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,849
Where did you get
such a beautiful cake?

689
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,618
( Giggling ) You made it!

690
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,653
Yeah, but who helped
me with the frosting?

691
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,189
We did!

692
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,959
- ( Phone rings )
- Mommy, you have to make a wish.

693
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,629
( Ringing )

694
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,197
- Hello?
- Mommy...

695
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,632
Shh!

696
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,038
Yes, Mr. Morse.

697
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,041
Okay.

698
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,315
( Exhales ) It's done.

699
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,851
They've made the arrest.

700
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:44,321
Mommy, come on! Make a wish!

701
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,392
- They're using you!
- That's ridiculous, George.

702
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,695
The d.A. Is not using
me. They believe me.

703
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,964
You're tearing
this family apart!

704
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,031
George, you're wrong.

705
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,177
I didn't do this to
the family, dad did.

706
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,869
- ( Click )
- George?

707
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,241
Sweetheart.

708
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,676
What?

709
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,345
Oh, god.

710
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,087
What if the kids hear something at
school? How do we protect them?

711
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,659
You tell the truth.

712
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,696
You saw a man do something bad.

713
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:29,099
You have to go to
court and tell your story...

714
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,969
That's how we protect them.

715
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:36,140
Morse: You should have seen the
stuff we found in Franklin's apartment.

716
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,275
The pornographic magazines,

717
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,278
and the pictures
of little children.

718
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,048
It'd be great if we
could get the jury

719
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,283
- to just look at that stuff.
- But they can't.

720
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,420
So the guy's a pervert...
Doesn't make him a murderer.

721
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:52,423
I'd give anything to get
Franklin on the stand.

722
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,759
Horngrad would never risk that.

723
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:59,029
If Eileen's not a reliable
witness, we got no case.

724
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,398
This is emotional stuff.

725
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,168
She could fall apart on us.

726
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:06,003
Have you done a rap sheet on me

727
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:09,406
and found out all the
secrets in my past?

728
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,141
This is Eileen.

729
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,876
Good morning, Eileen.

730
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,778
Yes, we have.

731
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:17,714
I'm Elaine tipton. Come in.

732
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:23,087
You know everything about
me and I know nothing about you.

733
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,788
- Morse: Have a seat.
- Thanks.

734
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,924
Elaine is prosecuting the case.

735
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,461
Wait a minute. I
spoke with Mr. Murray.

736
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,797
Mr. Murray has another
trial. There's a time conflict.

737
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,333
You promised you
wouldn't do this...

738
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,202
Hand me around
to different people.

739
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:41,472
It would have meant a delay,
and that could have hurt the case.

740
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,340
And your chances of winning.

741
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,910
My brother thinks you're using
this to promote your careers.

742
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,046
I know that. I talked to him.

743
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,447
He's testifying for the defense.

744
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,917
This lady walks on
water. You can trust her.

745
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,787
You told me I could trust you.

746
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,356
Susie is not just
another case to me.

747
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,960
If you don't trust that, then
we will wait for Mr. Murray.

748
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,362
Do you mean I
really have a choice?

749
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,364
Of course you have a choice.

750
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,967
You're our key witness.

751
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:12,402
( Sighs ) I don't
mean to be difficult.

752
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,104
Oh, no, you're right
to ask questions.

753
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:17,241
Eileen, we'll all on
the same side here...

754
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,243
Your side.

755
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,411
I've been thinking
about Susie's parents,

756
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:22,913
When I could see them.

757
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:24,348
You can't.

758
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,950
It might appear that you colluded
with them. We can't risk that.

759
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:30,220
Yeah, you can't make
any statements to the press.

760
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,523
In fact, you can't discuss
the case with anybody.

761
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,525
No reading newspapers,
no watching television,

762
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,961
and the only time you
go to the courtroom

763
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:39,997
- is when you testify.
- Why?

764
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,532
I want to hear the
other witnesses.

765
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,044
We can't let the defense say that
you got information about the murder

766
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,305
- Any way except from having been there.
- And no therapists.

767
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,408
( Groans ) That means
with my family away,

768
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,143
- I'll have no one.
- You'll have us.

769
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,413
Nobody is going to believe
that if you saw a therapist

770
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,416
- you didn't talk about the trial.
- ( Knocking )

771
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:03,453
And if they do subpoena your
therapist about your... thank you...

772
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,422
About your past treatment,

773
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,858
we can always request
that that information

774
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:10,027
remain confidential.

775
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,828
Thanks.

776
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:16,133
I don't have anything to hide.

777
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,535
Are we finished?

778
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:21,572
Unless you've got
some more questions.

779
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:24,408
I would like to see my father.

780
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,412
I've already called the jail.

781
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,183
Is that something I should
have asked permission to do?

782
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,353
Whether you see him or
not is entirely up to you.

783
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,455
When I arrested him,
the first thing he said was,

784
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,324
"have you talked
to my daughter?"

785
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:44,928
So maybe he'll confess and
save the state a lot of money.

786
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:48,465
( Door opens, closes )

787
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,276
( Laughing )

788
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:10,454
Daddy!

789
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,554
Is it really you?

790
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:21,525
Yeah. It is.

791
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,661
It's been a long time.

792
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:28,165
At least four years.

793
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:30,667
You've changed.

794
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,673
This is real difficult for me.

795
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,411
I have some things
I need to say to you.

796
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:48,485
I'm really proud of the
person I've become.

797
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:52,189
You gave me so many things...

798
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,691
You encouraged me to learn

799
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,594
and better myself

800
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,297
And speak my mind.

801
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:03,567
So that's what I'm doing.

802
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,536
Daddy, I don't hate you.

803
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:13,744
All those things you taught
me when I was a child,

804
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:17,080
that the truth
shall set you free,

805
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:21,084
I think you meant
that for both of us.

806
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:26,189
And I think you should
tell the truth now.

807
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:37,601
Is there anything
I can do for you?

808
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,070
There's one thing,

809
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,472
One thing that only you can do.

810
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,178
Anything else.

811
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,485
Yeah.

812
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:00,357
Come visit me again.

813
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,127
When I first heard this,

814
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,797
I felt as if a bomb had
been dropped on me

815
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:09,766
and I'd never sort
out the wreckage.

816
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,804
George is going to
testify for the defense.

817
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:17,107
I wasn't sure you knew.

818
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:20,777
They blame me for
wrecking the family.

819
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:22,212
Do you?

820
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:28,118
I talked with
Elaine tipton today.

821
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,520
I'm gonna testify
for the prosecution

822
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,823
and do all I can to support you.

823
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,257
What?

824
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:38,428
Thanks, mom.

825
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,831
I believe you were there.

826
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:45,469
And I'm sorry, because I
know how much you love him.

827
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,636
I went to see him...

828
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:47,737
Don't tell me.

829
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:51,808
We have to be careful. We're
not allowed to talk about it.

830
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,179
Right.

831
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,715
You're the lawyer.

832
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:02,853
At least your mother's
standing up for you this time.

833
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:06,423
Maybe this will bring
your family closer together.

834
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,726
Sure, if they'll ever
speak to me again.

835
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:13,430
If not, your father
didn't deny it, did he?

836
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,499
I think he was proud of me.

837
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,501
Proud?

838
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:21,471
Eileen, how can you still care
what that man thinks of you?

839
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:23,473
( Unrolls packing tape )

840
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,877
What I'm doing is
very hard for me, Barry.

841
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:30,614
A child shouldn't put
her parent in prison.

842
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,484
I just want to shut the
door and start over again!

843
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,354
This is crazy. What am I doing?

844
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,457
I can't leave you alone,
not at a time like this.

845
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:41,858
( Sighs )

846
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,861
One of us has to be
with Aaron and sica.

847
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,197
I'll settle them in and
then I'll come right back.

848
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:50,333
They can't start a new school in
a strange place without one of us.

849
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,372
At least I know that
they'll be away from all this.

850
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,440
I should be here for you.

851
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:02,512
I can do it alone. You know why?

852
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:05,415
Because my terrible
father taught me

853
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,618
That I'm strong enough
to handle anything.

854
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:12,522
Crazy, huh?

855
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,491
But I can do it.

856
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,767
I wish you were
coming with us, mommy.

857
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:26,503
Oh... soon.

858
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,638
As soon as I can.

859
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,941
Will you be safe
from the bad man?

860
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:35,345
Ohh... He can't
hurt me. Not now.

861
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:37,898
I love you.

862
00:53:37,899 --> 00:53:39,282
I love you, too.

863
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:40,517
Come on, guys.

864
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,820
I'll miss you!

865
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,722
- Bye, mom!
- Have a good time.

866
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:59,569
Hey, we're gonna get
through this, whatever happens.

867
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,705
I know.

868
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:05,675
I'll call you every night. We'll
have a zillion-dollar phone bill.

869
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,544
( Chuckles )

870
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:10,780
You promise me you'll call
my parents if you need anything.

871
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,051
And prom... ( Choking up )

872
00:54:14,052 --> 00:54:15,719
Oh, Barry.

873
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:24,694
I miss my wife, Eileen,
I miss her very much.

874
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,743
For you and the kids.
It's a going-away present.

875
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,979
But wait to open it till
you get home, okay?

876
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,454
Have a good flight.

877
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:54,424
Call me when you get
there so I know you're safe.

878
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:58,862
( Car starts )

879
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:01,297
Bye! I love you!

880
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:07,470
Sica: Bye, mom! I love you!

881
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,343
Love you! Bye!

882
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:39,636
Will I like Dr. Terr?

883
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,072
I think so.

884
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:43,573
Good.

885
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,943
Will she decide
whether I'm normal?

886
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,078
( Laughs )

887
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:50,080
I don't know. Probably.

888
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,716
She's an expert in
childhood trauma.

889
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:57,053
So we need her opinion to see
how your repressed memory fits.

890
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:02,559
Which means: Is it
real or did I make it up?

891
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:22,912
You said your mother had
breakdowns. How old were you?

892
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:27,016
The first time maybe six.

893
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:31,855
And did anyone ever
explain them to you?

894
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:35,725
My father said it was
what us kids did to her.

895
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:39,996
And during this...
The difficult times,

896
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,732
Did you ever speak
in another voice?

897
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,002
Another voice? ( Laughs )

898
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,605
No, of course not.

899
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:51,975
I'm just above-average strange.

900
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:55,078
What about being invisible?

901
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,816
Yes.

902
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,986
I thought...

903
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:08,491
if I could go into dark
places and curl up so small,

904
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:11,261
they wouldn't know I was there.

905
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:17,901
I hid in closets for years.

906
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:21,037
And what did you
do in the closet?

907
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,140
Sat. Waited. Thought.

908
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:31,481
Tell me about your father.

909
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,054
I thought he was...

910
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,925
The most handsome,
wonderful man.

911
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,626
We had fun.

912
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:47,163
What did you and your father
do that was so much fun?

913
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,566
Cuddle. Play.

914
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,935
Had adventures.

915
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:55,071
Tickled each other all over.

916
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,508
Until we got to
laughing so hard...

917
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,981
I realize now it
was inappropriate.

918
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:08,051
Was it during one of these
times that he molested you?

919
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:12,822
I'm not sure.

920
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:21,931
He was sitting on
the couch, and...

921
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,766
( Sighs )

922
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,540
He...

923
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:33,910
Reached under my dress. And...

924
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:39,682
And made digital penetration?

925
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,088
( Exhales )

926
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:49,859
It's very comfortable here.

927
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:52,595
Good place to hide?

928
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,865
No. A good place to be quiet.

929
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:58,101
Wasn't it ever
quiet in your house?

930
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,937
I still hear the
noise in my head.

931
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,942
Did you ever wonder
about your friends' homes?

932
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,714
I thought everyone was the same.

933
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:14,751
I mean, even the
Brady bunch on TV?

934
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:19,989
I figured when the dad closed
the door he beat everyone up.

935
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,896
Want to get some coffee?

936
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,331
Oh, look. Come on.

937
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,134
Help me pick out
something for my kids.

938
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,306
We've gotta talk.

939
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:39,008
Why does that scare me?
How about the green sweatshirt?

940
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,779
At first when we ran a background
check on you it was clean.

941
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:44,747
But then we looked again.

942
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:46,983
The blue print dress?

943
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:53,790
( Sighs ) I was very young.

944
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:57,126
I had gotten into drugs.

945
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:03,666
Look at that
well-dressed, together lady.

946
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:07,670
Would you believe that she could
have been arrested for prostitution?

947
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,343
It's not admissible in court,

948
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:16,212
but we can't control what
some reporter might find out

949
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,781
And make public.

950
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,186
Would that make your
key witness less credible?

951
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:26,656
No, no. According to the
psychiatrist that we have checked with,

952
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:29,325
it seems that this
is a behavior pattern

953
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:33,029
That a lot of sexually abused
children follow when they grow up.

954
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:39,235
Try explaining behavior patterns
to my 7-year-old daughter.

955
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:42,105
How do you
explain it to yourself?

956
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:45,708
If everybody finds out, do
you think they'll still let me

957
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:48,411
Be the brownie
leader for my kids?

958
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,380
I listened to the transcript.

959
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:53,249
Undercover cop got lucky.

960
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:57,253
The escort service
said I'd be a natural.

961
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,123
How did I know I'd
get a date with a cop?

962
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:02,959
He was wired, he said
he didn't have your price.

963
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:05,094
When you asked
him what he did have,

964
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,698
You told him to keep twenty
so he wouldn't be broke.

965
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:11,100
I guess I wasn't
cut out for the job.

966
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,137
Now you know why I don't
trust the guys in the white hats.

967
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:18,274
Well, I was hoping
we could change that.

968
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:22,412
You think he ever wonders what
happened to that kid he busted?

969
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:25,748
Maybe he hopes that
he stopped you in time.

970
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:29,118
You say that because
you only see the downside.

971
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,190
What other side is there?

972
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,293
For me? I was in charge.

973
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,296
If I didn't like the
terms, I said no.

974
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:44,000
That was a luxury I
didn't have as a child.

975
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:47,470
We loved your present.

976
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:51,140
I just made it for
breakfast for the kids.

977
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,876
Eileen: When I'm
there I'll cook up a feast.

978
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:57,146
- Did you get the kids settled in school?
- Don't worry.

979
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,781
Sica already has a friend,

980
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:01,784
And Aaron's discovered
the cows next door.

981
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:02,886
So if you need me...

982
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:03,920
I'm fine.

983
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:05,888
Just don't let the
kids forget me.

984
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:10,793
You can't believe how empty
this place feels without you.

985
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,096
Oh, yes I can.

986
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:16,332
This must have been
where he parked the Van.

987
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,451
I'm gonna ask her to
testify about the rape.

988
01:02:18,452 --> 01:02:20,503
In open court?

989
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,106
Do you know what
that would cost her?

990
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:25,908
This whole case depends
on proving repressed memory.

991
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,443
According to Dr. Terr,

992
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:30,046
traumatic repression
is substantiated

993
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:32,782
by repeated
violence in childhood.

994
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:34,951
I'm not sure she
can get through it.

995
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:36,228
The amount of time
I've spent with her

996
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:39,188
poring over this case,
seems to me she can.

997
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,190
Now, whether
she'll agree to it...

998
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,493
Eileen.

999
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:48,064
We have something
very difficult to ask of you.

1000
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:52,502
Besides turning my
life upside-down?

1001
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:54,971
Sure, go ahead.

1002
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:59,108
We're gonna have to include
the rape testimony in the trial.

1003
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:03,246
No. I will not sit up there
and have all those strangers

1004
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:05,381
hear what my father did to me.

1005
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,117
That's not fair. It's
not their business.

1006
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,886
This was not a casual decision.

1007
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,322
Then ask him about it. Have
him tell you. I'm not the murderer.

1008
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:16,109
He is not going to testify.

1009
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:18,828
So I get to tear myself apart?

1010
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:21,831
Have the world see
me as damaged goods?

1011
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:26,002
I'm already risking them finding out
about my past... what do you guys want?

1012
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:29,005
For you to be able to
stop hiding in closets.

1013
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:30,540
I like closets.

1014
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:32,575
Eileen, if it would help,

1015
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,278
why don't you try telling
it to us, to me, now?

1016
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:36,462
Just to get it out.

1017
01:03:36,463 --> 01:03:37,580
No.

1018
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,315
You prove it.

1019
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:41,884
Haven't I been
ripped open enough?

1020
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:43,586
I am here to support
you in every way.

1021
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,922
But I cannot get on
that stand for you.

1022
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:49,559
It's your words the jury has to
hear, your pain they have to feel,

1023
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:52,261
your courage they have to see.

1024
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:55,031
Look, please, just...

1025
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:59,001
Just sit down and
try it with me once.

1026
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,103
Okay?

1027
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:21,290
( Wearily) Okay.

1028
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:29,432
Okay. If you need me,
I'll have my beeper on.

1029
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:38,140
( Clears throat )

1030
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:44,013
I used to get stomach aches...

1031
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:49,018
and they'd keep me
home from school.

1032
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:54,223
So I'd go spend
the day with my dad.

1033
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,359
But if you were too
sick to go to school,

1034
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:59,228
how could you go
out with your dad?

1035
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,132
I don't know.

1036
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:04,367
Was this his idea?

1037
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:05,534
Yes.

1038
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:09,972
He used to moonlight
from his job as a fireman,

1039
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:13,342
Paint houses and
apartments and things.

1040
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:18,080
One day we...

1041
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:20,950
We went up to San Francisco,

1042
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:24,220
To some empty apartment.

1043
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:27,056
Can you describe the apartment?

1044
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,229
( Laughing )

1045
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,033
- ( Gasping )
- Eileen?

1046
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,668
I have to... I have to go.

1047
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:42,638
What's happening?
Eileen! Please, wait!

1048
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,641
( Door slams )

1049
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:56,452
( Children chattering )

1050
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:19,975
You're still here. You
knew I'd be back, didn't you?

1051
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,377
Come on.

1052
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,646
Have a seat.

1053
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:32,621
Hungry?

1054
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:46,335
The floors were
bare and... Cold.

1055
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,271
Hardwood.

1056
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:59,014
There were windows. No drapes.

1057
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:00,549
Did I say that?

1058
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,017
No.

1059
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,687
There was a
stereo. Cans of beer.

1060
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:07,256
Who was there?

1061
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:12,728
My dad...

1062
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:15,297
And a man.

1063
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:18,567
Do you know who he was?

1064
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:24,507
That's what I remembered.

1065
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:29,712
They were acting kind of crazy.

1066
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,717
I think they were doing drugs.

1067
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:37,720
And they acted
crazier and crazier.

1068
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:44,827
And then my father held
me down on this table.

1069
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:49,432
He held my shoulder.

1070
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:54,770
His other hand
was over my mouth.

1071
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:58,174
And he...

1072
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:04,447
He le... let this man rape me.

1073
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:18,794
Tipton: Can you identify

1074
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,729
the man?

1075
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:29,371
It was Sam Gerard.

1076
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:32,608
I'm sorry. Could the
witness please speak up?

1077
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,613
Sam Gerard.

1078
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:42,885
And how did you know his name?

1079
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:48,791
He's my godfather.

1080
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,894
( Spectators murmur )

1081
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,500
What happened afterward?

1082
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:02,238
They left me there.

1083
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:06,308
I don't know where they went.

1084
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,911
I just... Waited.

1085
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:13,382
And then what did you do?

1086
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:19,288
When I could sit up...

1087
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:22,691
I put on my shoes and socks

1088
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:26,795
And I went to find my
dad so I could go home.

1089
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,705
The court will take
a 20-minute recess.

1090
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:38,841
You will all remember not
to discuss the proceedings

1091
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:40,843
among yourselves
or with anyone else.

1092
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,811
( Strikes gavel )

1093
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,817
( Whispering )

1094
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,822
( Whispering )

1095
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:11,440
Relax.

1096
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,776
You did well up there.

1097
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:15,578
Here, sit down.

1098
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:23,485
I could hear the
newspeople scribbling

1099
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,921
Every time I said anything.

1100
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:28,390
Yeah, well...

1101
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:31,360
pretend you're
in Elaine's office

1102
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:34,496
and just breathe easy.

1103
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,365
( Exhales )

1104
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:42,237
it's like being
violated all over again

1105
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:45,341
with all those strange people...

1106
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:51,347
I'm not going to let
them see me cry again.

1107
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:56,752
It's the only private
thing I've got left.

1108
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:00,289
Woman: This is channel 5 news.

1109
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:03,259
Today in the
courtroom, shocking...

1110
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:12,267
Any comments?

1111
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:14,670
Does your client got a comment?

1112
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:17,373
Eileen: This is Susie nason.

1113
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:25,314
And this is my daughter.

1114
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:27,316
Thank you.

1115
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:30,052
Can you see a resemblance
between your daughter

1116
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,954
- and Susie nason?
- Very much so.

1117
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:36,892
They're both blond,
blue-eyed little girls.

1118
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:40,963
And it was while you were
looking at your daughter

1119
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,832
That you had your first
memory of the murder?

1120
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:45,701
Yes.

1121
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:49,004
I was holding my son Aaron,

1122
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:52,341
and sica... Jessica...

1123
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:56,445
Was below me,
playing with a friend.

1124
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,614
She looked up at me...

1125
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:01,850
Her eyes are bright
blue, just like Susie's...

1126
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:06,355
And suddenly I saw Susie's face.

1127
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:10,459
How did Susie come to be with
you on the day of her disappearance?

1128
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,995
I was with my dad in his Van.

1129
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:17,433
On the board beside you there's a
photo of a Van. Is that the same Van?

1130
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,102
You can get up and
take a closer look.

1131
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:30,112
Yes.

1132
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:44,026
We were driving around,

1133
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,895
and we saw Susie across
the street from her house

1134
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:50,499
In front of a wide open field.

1135
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,468
I was excited,

1136
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:56,138
And I asked him if
she could come with us.

1137
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:59,475
So we picked her up.

1138
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,810
And where did you go?

1139
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,779
Toward a wooded place.

1140
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:06,815
Now I think it must
have been half moon bay.

1141
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,818
There was a
mattress in the back,

1142
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:13,622
And we were... Rolling
around and playing.

1143
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:20,696
What happened after your
father stopped the Van?

1144
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:24,933
We were bouncing on the bed...

1145
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,668
And playing.

1146
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:28,937
I remember I looked out

1147
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,840
and I saw him standing outside,

1148
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,176
drinking a beer

1149
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:37,646
And, I think,
smoking a cigarette.

1150
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:40,916
The side door was open.

1151
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:47,422
And he... my father...

1152
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:52,060
Was standing there,
blocking out the sun.

1153
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:58,100
And then I remember
him getting into the Van.

1154
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:01,537
And what did he do
when he got in the Van?

1155
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:07,109
He... started playing with us.

1156
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:09,111
Did you remain in
the back of the Van

1157
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:11,980
- while he was playing with you and Susie?
- At first.

1158
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:14,449
And then I...

1159
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:17,085
Walked up between
the two front seats,

1160
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:20,222
and I got onto the
passenger seat

1161
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:23,659
and I turned around and put
my hands on the back of the seat.

1162
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:30,232
Will you please describe
for us what you saw?

1163
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:36,171
Susie's knees bent,

1164
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:39,174
her... skirt up,

1165
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:42,110
something white...

1166
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:45,614
Ohh, this is hard...

1167
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:52,187
Um...

1168
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:54,590
My father...

1169
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:59,261
Did he have his trousers on?

1170
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,598
Yes, I'm pretty sure he did.

1171
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:09,671
He was holding her arms
up against the mattress,

1172
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:14,509
And I slid down on the floor.

1173
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:16,178
Eileen,

1174
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:18,180
what, if any, noise or sound

1175
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:20,182
did you hear Susie make?

1176
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:24,953
I think she... I think she said,

1177
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,522
"stop! No!

1178
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:30,158
No, don't!"

1179
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,034
May I have some water, please?

1180
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,909
Tipton: Go ahead, Eileen.

1181
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:50,712
Susie looked up, and
we made eye contact.

1182
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:54,683
And i... i think I screamed
when I saw my father.

1183
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,953
Could you describe what
your father was doing?

1184
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:02,224
He had his arms up...

1185
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:06,128
He was holding a rock.

1186
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:09,231
Then he hit her
on the head with it.

1187
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,099
And I heard...

1188
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:15,671
I'm sorry.

1189
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,212
Um...

1190
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:29,284
a terrible blow.

1191
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:32,120
Then I heard it again.

1192
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:35,223
Could you describe what you saw?

1193
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,831
( Door closes )

1194
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:48,236
she was...

1195
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:53,275
She was slumped over.

1196
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:55,877
There was blood.

1197
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,281
A lot of blood.

1198
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:02,250
Something whitish.

1199
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:07,856
Clumps of hair,
not... On her head.

1200
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:13,628
It was so frightening
I turned away.

1201
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:16,865
Then I looked at her hand.

1202
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:21,169
It was crushed.

1203
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:29,077
I somehow focused on the ring.

1204
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:32,314
It was silver.

1205
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:34,916
Then I stared at it.

1206
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:38,020
Then what did you do?

1207
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:42,675
I ran.

1208
01:17:42,676 --> 01:17:44,326
What did your father do?

1209
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:47,763
He came after me,
pulled me down,

1210
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:50,165
and held my face in the leaves,

1211
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:52,801
I guess to stop me screaming.

1212
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:55,354
And did you stop screaming?

1213
01:17:55,355 --> 01:17:57,839
I must have...

1214
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:02,677
Because I was on his knee, and
he was holding me and telling me...

1215
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:07,182
That I had to forget
it and that it was over.

1216
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:12,354
Like really softly
and comforting...

1217
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:13,989
It was over.

1218
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:22,364
What did he say to you to
make sure you'd keep his secret?

1219
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:26,268
That if I told, they
wouldn't believe me.

1220
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:28,070
They'd think I was crazy

1221
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:31,339
And put me away like
they did my mother.

1222
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:33,075
That scared me.

1223
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:36,378
Then he said
they'd blame it on me

1224
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,980
because it was my idea,

1225
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:43,085
I was the one who saw Susie
and wanted her to come with us.

1226
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,857
If it hadn't have been for me,
she wouldn't have been there.

1227
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:54,229
Then what did he say?

1228
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:03,738
He said...

1229
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:06,775
If I told, he'd have
to kill me, too.

1230
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:10,245
Eileen, what were you doing
while he was telling you this?

1231
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:14,382
I was sitting on his knee,
and I think I was crying.

1232
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,890
Eileen, what were your
dreams when you were a child?

1233
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,294
I didn't dream.

1234
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:29,898
Dreams of the future?
Of when you were grown?

1235
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,035
I didn't think I'd
have a future.

1236
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:36,138
What did you think?

1237
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:42,410
That I'd be killed.

1238
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,452
( Cable car bell rings )

1239
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:24,019
Hi, mommy.

1240
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:25,420
I miss you a lot.

1241
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,556
Guess what? A
couple of days ago,

1242
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,258
Me and Aaron drew pictures
of our house in Switzerland.

1243
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:32,427
See? This is mine.

1244
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,463
There's the house, and
these are the mountains.

1245
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,199
And that's the
car, and that's me.

1246
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,301
See?

1247
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:41,036
And Aaron made a picture, too.

1248
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:42,437
Show her your picture.

1249
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:45,440
Hi, mommy! Look at my picture!

1250
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:51,179
Guess what we get to eat?

1251
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:52,180
Barry: Let's make
mommy really jealous

1252
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:55,317
And tell her what we get to eat.

1253
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:58,620
All: Swiss chocolate!

1254
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,022
Mmm!

1255
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:06,094
For today, a
possibility of testimony

1256
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:07,896
from other family members...

1257
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:21,610
On the occasion that
you visited your sister,

1258
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:23,962
Did you spend any time
discussing your family with her?

1259
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:26,248
Yes.

1260
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:29,517
And did the topic of
dysfunctional families come up?

1261
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:33,455
Yes. She was
disparaging my parents.

1262
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:36,591
Our parents.

1263
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:51,640
Lipton: Isn't it true
that you told Eileen

1264
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:53,541
that if she came forward

1265
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,486
it would make it impossible
for your child to grow up

1266
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:56,945
without a cloud over his head?

1267
01:21:56,946 --> 01:21:58,380
No, I never said that.

1268
01:21:58,446 --> 01:22:01,650
What I told Eileen was that
she and Barry are adults,

1269
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:04,519
and they have to do
what they think is right.

1270
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,395
Thank you.

1271
01:22:13,396 --> 01:22:14,429
You're welcome.

1272
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:20,502
How's it been seeing
your father in court?

1273
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:25,640
Some days I can't even
stand to look at him.

1274
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,411
And then I'm eight
years old again

1275
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:32,447
And all I want is for
him not to be mad.

1276
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,149
Did you reach Bob?

1277
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:36,718
I left his beeper
number in my office.

1278
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,688
- I'll have to call him when I get up there.
- Make it up.

1279
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:43,158
The worst that could happen is that
you've paged some gorgeous doctor

1280
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:44,693
and your life
would be wonderful.

1281
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,028
( Laughs ) My life is wonderful.

1282
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:49,464
Well, you know what I mean.

1283
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:53,435
It would never occur to me to
say to you you should get a career,

1284
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:55,303
Then your life's
gonna be wonderful.

1285
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:57,339
But you'd be right, it would be.

1286
01:22:57,405 --> 01:23:00,175
I'd love to have a career
after the kids are older.

1287
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:03,578
Your mother became a
lawyer after two breakdowns,

1288
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:05,347
five kids and an
abusive marriage.

1289
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:10,185
I mean, she just
changed her whole future.

1290
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:13,588
Just once I wish she'd
say she was sorry.

1291
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:14,655
Just once.

1292
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:17,192
Could you forgive her then?

1293
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:21,062
You're not the only one
your father hurt and betrayed.

1294
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:23,598
Why is it up to me?

1295
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:28,103
I guess it's up to whoever
has the strength to do it.

1296
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:30,438
My bet's on you.

1297
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:35,343
Some days I wake up scared.

1298
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:38,613
And other days I
wake up and feel...

1299
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,680
Free?

1300
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:45,854
Tipton: To your knowledge,

1301
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,791
Has Kate ever encouraged
Eileen to disclose this information?

1302
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,394
Objection. Asked and answered.

1303
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,778
Relevance.

1304
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,096
Overruled.

1305
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:57,499
No, she's not.

1306
01:23:57,565 --> 01:24:00,435
She has been adamantly
opposed to Eileen

1307
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:02,637
ever since Eileen
disclosed the facts to her.

1308
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:05,473
Thank you. Nothing further.

1309
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:30,532
( Camera shutters click )

1310
01:24:55,924 --> 01:25:00,428
You obeyed your father
and didn't tell for 20 years.

1311
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:01,830
Is that correct?

1312
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:03,465
I didn't remember it.

1313
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:05,867
Did you forget it immediately?

1314
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,436
On the way home?
The next day? When?

1315
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:10,171
I don't remember.

1316
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:12,707
On the way home I thought...

1317
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,610
We shouldn't leave her,
she'll be cold and frightened.

1318
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:17,079
But you knew she was dead.

1319
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,480
I did.

1320
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:23,718
But I don't know if I knew
what dead was at the age.

1321
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:26,855
Did the police come to
your house that night?

1322
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:28,857
I remember hearing sounds,

1323
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:31,593
doors opening, voices,

1324
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:34,229
but I stayed in my room.

1325
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:36,598
You were her best friend,

1326
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,867
and you didn't
talk to the police.

1327
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:40,602
Objection. Misleading.

1328
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:42,570
Sustained.

1329
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:47,876
During the period that
this memory came to you,

1330
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:52,914
Had you already remembered
the incidents of sexual abuse?

1331
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:56,618
I had some memories
before the murder.

1332
01:25:56,684 --> 01:25:59,354
Others came after.

1333
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:02,524
Would you describe your
thoughts about your father

1334
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:04,626
during this period as "angry"?

1335
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:06,294
Objection as to relevance.

1336
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:09,497
Bias. Motive. State
of mind is critical.

1337
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,599
Sustained.

1338
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,903
Pardon me a moment, counsel.

1339
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:17,272
It is clear that she
has cause to be angry,

1340
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,507
But after all, she is
accusing her father of murder.

1341
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:21,409
She is the primary
witness against...

1342
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:23,678
- I will sustain the objection.
- Thank you.

1343
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,653
Mrs. Lipsker, did
you initially testify

1344
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,521
that this event happened
on the way to school?

1345
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:35,657
That's what I
thought at first, yes.

1346
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:39,661
And now you say your dad
picked Susan up in the afternoon.

1347
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:43,264
I came to realize
it was afternoon.

1348
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:45,800
It was your realization,

1349
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:48,570
not hearing on TV or reading

1350
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,539
that the disappearance
occurred in the afternoon?

1351
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:56,578
I have been instructed not to
watch TV or read the papers.

1352
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:59,514
Your honor, may we
approach the bench?

1353
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,421
My theory is that this witness

1354
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:07,989
has changed and
expanded her story

1355
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:10,858
to conform to the facts
she has read or seen on TV.

1356
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:12,560
She's been instructed not to

1357
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:14,562
and has testified
to that under oath.

1358
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:17,565
I would like to submit to the
jury a list of case evidence

1359
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:19,601
That's publicly available.

1360
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:22,470
I'm not sure that's proper.
I'd have to consider it.

1361
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:23,538
I object, your honor.

1362
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:26,574
There is also a lot of
wrong information available.

1363
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:30,578
Eileen has never picked
anything that was incorrect.

1364
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:33,314
That's a very good
point, counselor.

1365
01:27:34,816 --> 01:27:38,620
Mr. Horngrad, you may
follow your line of questioning,

1366
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:40,588
but may not submit
a list into evidence.

1367
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:42,657
- Thank you, your honor.
- Thank you, your honor.

1368
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:49,597
You testified that you saw...

1369
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:51,032
"Clutter"... was that your word?

1370
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,217
Yes.

1371
01:27:52,218 --> 01:27:53,334
When was the first time

1372
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:55,370
That you remembered
that you saw clutter?

1373
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:58,006
Because it was not in
your original statement.

1374
01:27:58,072 --> 01:28:00,008
When I was talking
to Elaine tipton.

1375
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:03,611
She asked me what else I saw,

1376
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:05,513
if I looked around.

1377
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:09,017
I did look beyond
Susan's head and hand

1378
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:11,853
and saw clutter.

1379
01:28:14,722 --> 01:28:18,893
And you never
read in the paper...

1380
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,064
That Susan's body was
found in a dump site?

1381
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,500
No, I did not.

1382
01:28:25,566 --> 01:28:29,671
It's too bad there are no
other witnesses but you

1383
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:31,773
To corroborate this story.

1384
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:34,008
But there was another witness.

1385
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:37,645
Who?

1386
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:40,515
My father.

1387
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:53,661
You're not a child anymore.
You could take care of yourself.

1388
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:55,530
I know that now.

1389
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:58,399
I need to get back
to Barry and the kids.

1390
01:28:58,466 --> 01:29:01,936
I need to start over again
and put all this behind me.

1391
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,072
You will.

1392
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:06,974
Listen, that little girl that
hid herself in the closet,

1393
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:10,411
she's not afraid of
the dark, trust me.

1394
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:12,113
I do.

1395
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,049
I couldn't have gotten
through this without you.

1396
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:19,120
What is this?

1397
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,588
Ha ha!

1398
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:22,824
The white hat. Ha.

1399
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:25,693
( Drawls ) Well,
thank you, ma'am.

1400
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,563
Mah pleasure.

1401
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,700
Ladies and gentlemen,

1402
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:35,703
you only have to
decide one thing:

1403
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:39,841
whether or not
George Franklin, sr.,

1404
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:44,445
Did or did not kill Susie nason.

1405
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:47,615
This is a heartbreaking story...

1406
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:50,852
about three little girls,

1407
01:29:50,918 --> 01:29:54,122
their lives entwined
by the criminal act

1408
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:56,858
of George Franklin, sr.

1409
01:29:56,924 --> 01:29:59,627
Susie died...

1410
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:03,498
Because she
trusted the defendant.

1411
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:07,001
Eileen survived by
burying the memory

1412
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:09,871
and her childhood.

1413
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:12,573
Jessica brought
them back together.

1414
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:18,146
The road to this moment
travels through memory

1415
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:20,615
over 20 years,

1416
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:24,886
and it follows a
trail stark, sorrowful,

1417
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:28,723
and as straightforward
as a desert highway.

1418
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:16,103
