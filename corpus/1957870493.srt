it's very big.

123

- It's huge.
- SANDRA: Mm hmm.

124
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,928
That's why we rented this place
originally.

125
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:09,063
That's why we were
gonna throw a party originally.

126

But none of that matters now,
because she's gone.

127
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:16,537
So, could you please
just cancel the party?

128
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:21,609

179
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:29,697
Okay.

180
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,068
Goodnight, Milwaukee!

00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,353
WOMAN WITH DYED-HAIR:
(On video) <i>Eric, are you getting this?</i>

184
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,787
ERIC: (On video)
<i>Yep, takin' video.</i>

185
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,389

00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,430
<i>Vanessa, what are you doing?</i>

189
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:06,200
VANESSA: (On video)
<i>I am just making sure.</i>

190
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,301
WOMAN WITH DYED-HAIR: (On

191
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,102
<i>You already read it!</i>

192
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,236
<i>Just sign it!</i>

198
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,114

199
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,315
<i>It's happening.</i>

200
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,349
<i>It's happening.</i>

201
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:22,883
<i>It'll happen faster
if you sign it.</i>

202
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:23,552
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

<i>Eric, horizontal.</i>

WOMAN WITH DYED-HAIR:
Coffee?

221
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:24,471
Yeah. Thanks, Jen.

Jesus!

230
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:17,592
Pancakes.

231
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,162
No.

232
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:25,966
What...

233
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:26,900
(Plate clinks)

234
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,938
I know this is an odd encounter.

235
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,641
My appearance resembles
your perished companion.

236
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,612
Unfortunately,
Jennifer continues

237
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:40,582
and will continue
to remain deceased.

238
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:43,551
I am simply an extraterrestrial
who has taken her form.

239
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:58,399
Now that you have had ample time
to comprehend what I have said,

240
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,569
please stop leaving!

Eric, I'm coming home.

<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's goin' on?</i>

<i>Are you okay? Are you hurt?</i>

245
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,611
No, I just... I was, um...

246
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,248
I don't know,
I was inside and then...

247
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,382
I don't know.

248
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,484
I'm...
I feel like I'm going crazy.

249
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,187
ERIC: (On video call) <i>Babe,
your best friend passed away.</i>

<i>You're... you're processing.</i>

252
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:26,528
I'm processing.

253
00:15:26,561 --> 00:15:28,128
ERIC: (On video call)
<i>Yes. Yeah, yeah!</i>

254
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:29,597
<i>You're... you're...
You're havin' a moment!</i>

255
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:32,366
Yeah, I was having a moment.

256
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,967
<i>Exactly!</i>

257
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,036
I just don't wanna totally
lose it out here, Eric.

258
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,237
<i>Come on.</i>

259
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,073
<i>Come on, Vanessa,
you're not gonna lose it!</i>

260
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,976
<i>You're like a freak of nature.</i>

261
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,513
Like a total freakin' freak
of nature.

262
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:49,149
Okay, I feel um, better.

263
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:51,118
I'm... I'm breathing at least.

264
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,286
ERIC: (On video call)
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

265
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,056
<i>You know, maybe go outside,
take a hike,</i>

266
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,391
<i>get some fresh air.</i>

267
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,626
<i>That might be nice.</i>

268
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,394
Okay. Thank you.

269
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,731
Don't come out here, I'm fine.

270
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:06,333
<i>Nope, wasn't thinkin'
about comin' out there.</i>

271
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,368
<i>I was thinkin'
about goin' halfway, though.</i>

272
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,037
Eric, I'm... I'm fine.

273
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,438
ERIC: (On video call)
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

274
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:14,041
<i>But maybe I just
look at hotel prices</i>

275
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:14,742
<i>just in case.</i>

276
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:16,443
Honey, stop.

277
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:19,514
<i>Okay, okay. I... I love you.</i>

278
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:20,481
I love you.

279
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,318
<i>Bye.</i>

What were you gonna do?

286
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:10,497
Key your friend?

287
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,368

00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:34,722
JENNIFER:
You've returned.

290
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:35,823
Shall we proceed?

291
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,093
No, no, no, no.

292
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,529
I don't wanna go crazy.

293
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:43,831
(Glass clinks)

294
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:49,436
I can assure you
my appearance is not a result

295
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:50,805
of you going crazy.

296
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:52,807
Okay.

297
00:17:54,642 --> 00:17:58,412
(Chugs olive oil)

298
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:05,152
You are watching
your dead best friend

299
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,353
chug olive oil.

300
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:10,424
(Sighs)

301
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,226
This galaxy sun
damages my structure.

302
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,564
We have discovered that oil
provides protective lubrication.

303
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:18,332
Margarita?

304
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:19,834
VANESSA:
No!

305
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:22,804
No, I don't want a margarita.

306
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:24,304
I wanna know what's happening.

307
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,374
Then shall we begin orientation?

308
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,645
What?

309
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:31,646
Shall we?

310
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:35,115
Oh, you want me to sit?

311
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:38,720
Shall we?

312
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,254
Are you just
gonna keep saying "shall we"

313
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,456
until I sit down?

314
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:45,158
- Shall we?
- Okay, okay.

315
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:51,498
(Chugs olive oil)

316
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,234
Hello.

317
00:18:58,372 --> 00:18:59,272
Hi.

318
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,207
(Bottle clinks)

319
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:03,645
(Device clunks)

320
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:08,415
(♪♪♪)

321
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,586
Oh. Okay.

322
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,690
JENNIFER: I am a
species observation officer.

323
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:19,594
Is that supposed to be me?

324
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:21,562
JENNIFER:
Yes, and that is me.

325
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:22,730
On this maiden voyage,

326
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:24,666
our mission is
to study human subjects,

327
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,534
so that we may have
a full comprehension

328
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,735
of your species.

329
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:31,204
Why? To kill us?

330
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,409
We have not discovered a benefit
to your destruction.

331
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:39,914
We will focus on your physical
and cognitive abilities,

332
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:43,417
as well as other behaviors
and emotive response.

333
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,619
It is similar

334
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:46,788
to how your species
studies other species.

335
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:49,991
After 48 hours, I will depart
without having harmed you

336
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:51,559
in any way.

337
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:52,527
That's nice.

338
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,869
So, I shouldn't have taken
that Xanax

339
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:03,771
with a bottle of champagne.

340
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:06,941
And I probably choked
on my own vomit.

341
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:12,013
And I died on this lounge chair,
which is why I'm back.

342
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:13,014
Okay.

343
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:15,583
No, incorrect narrative.

344
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:16,584
Okey do key.

345
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:19,887
You must have inquiries.

346
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:21,923
No, I... I think I'm gonna go.

347
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:24,324
JENNIFER:
Where will you go?

348
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,660
To the hospital.

349
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:27,729
(Battery beeps)

350
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:30,430
No, I just charged,
this was at 30%.

351
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,868
That is because of
your device's proximity to me.

352
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:35,837
My planet is made up

353
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,539
of what you would call
"lightning storms",

354
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:40,373
which we have adapted to.

355
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,745
Thus, we absorb the battery life
of anything around us

356
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:45,780
with a battery life.

357
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:49,984
And we can conduct heat.

358
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:50,785
Observe.

359
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:52,987
(Fire rumbles)

360
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:58,860
Okay. It's part of the process.

361
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:02,496
Just you miss your best friend
who died,

362
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,500
so you conjured up
this fucked up... no of fence,

363
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,368
alien version of her.

364
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,771
Inaccurate.

365
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:13,574
If I'm truly hallucinating,
then this won't hurt.

366
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:16,309
- Injury imminent.
- Ow! Mm, ow!

367
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:18,846
That... okay, that's real.

368
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,315
That is very real, which means

369
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,986
I must have blacked out,
started the fire,

370
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,688
and then blacked back in.

371
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:28,923
Blacked back in.

372
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,490
I don't know. Let me think.

373
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:37,732
(Jennifer grunting)

374
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:40,701
What are you doing?

375
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:42,036
These hair pouches torment me.

376
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:45,372
They are always there
when I look up.

377
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:49,010
Have you ceased thinking?

378
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:50,410
Do you consent to testing?

379
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:53,446
It's my choice?

380
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,682
Yes, you have control.

381
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:59,654
Yes. Yes, I do.

382
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:03,024
It is in my control,
because I am a strong,

383
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:05,059
powerful woman.

384
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:07,394
A freak of nature,
some have said.

385
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,096
And I am perfectly capable

386
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,032
of taking charge
of my own mental breakdown.

387
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:14,969
It's my decision.

388
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,805
So, my decision next will be
to have this margarita.

389
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,773
Cheers.

390
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:21,542
(Slurps)

391
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:22,944
I would also like to...
Oh, that's delicious.

392
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:26,113
Wait, how do you know

393
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:29,150
I like pomegranate
and jalapenos?

394
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,919
I have
all of Jennifer's memories.

395
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:34,454
In exchange
for your participation,

396
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:38,025
you receive two days
with your dead best friend.

397
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,694
Why did you not lead with that?

398
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:42,563
My brain.

399
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:43,598
JENNIFER:
I will make a note.

400
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:47,935
For future visits,
lead with memories.

401
00:22:47,969 --> 00:22:50,071
So I can just ask you
anything I want?

402
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:50,938
JENNIFER:
You may.

403
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,109
This is good. I like that.

404
00:22:56,944 --> 00:22:58,546
Okay. I'm gonna test you.

405
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:02,917
What is
Jennifer's favorite color?

406
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,751
Wait, that's a stupid question.

407
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,152
Hot pink.

408
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:06,721
I mean, of course,
you get the clue from the hair.

409
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:10,490
In college, I had a pet lizard.

410
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:13,561
I went away for the weekend
and Jennifer told me

411
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:14,729
that he died of natural causes.

412
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:15,630
Is that true?

413
00:23:15,663 --> 00:23:16,964
No.

414
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:19,800
Jennifer accidentally impaled it
with a high heel.

415
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:20,768
Franklin.

416
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:24,538
I mean I have no way of knowing
if any of this is real.

417
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:29,476
Okay, this is something
I only told Jennifer.

418
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,780
In second grade, I told everyone
that I kissed Tyler,

419
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,015
but the real person

420
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:35,816
that I kissed
behind the dumpster was...

421
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,450
Cody who smells grody.

422
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:38,519
Dammit.

423
00:23:41,022 --> 00:23:43,490
Whatever. Fine. I guess I'm in.

424
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,994
It might be fun to see
how unstable I can get.

425
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:48,629
If this is
what you find to be fun,

426
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:50,031
then I do hope we achieve it!

427
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:57,505
So, if you are really an alien,

428
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,206
why was I chosen
as the human subject?

429
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,777
JENNIFER:
Species observation officers

430
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,680
do not have jurisdiction
over who their subject is.

431
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:06,814
I was assigned to you.

432
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:11,719
Oh, sorry.

433
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:13,988
That is Jennifer's ring?

434
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:15,990
Yeah.

435
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,595
Jennifer uh, got us these
for my 8th birthday.

436
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,832
I asked all the girls
in our class

437
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,267
to come over
for a slumber party,

438
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,169
but Jennifer was the only one
who showed up.

439
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:32,239
My mom went hard
for the theme, too.

440
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:34,241
It was out of this world,

441
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:39,046
which is why
I am imagining this.

442
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:43,050
Jennifer mixed syrupy soda
with fizzy candy

443
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:44,986
and experienced
excessive regurgitation

444
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:46,821
that night.

445
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:49,724
Yeah, she...
She puked really hard.

446
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:51,859
(Chuckles)

447
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:54,729
It was probably
more of a positive memory

448
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:55,796
for me than her.

449
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:01,135
Jennifer wrote in her diary,
"Best night ever".

450
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,306
Test complete next.

451
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,776
VANESSA: Fifth grade,
we rode our bikes downtown,

452
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,644
got lost, had to call my parents
to pick us up.

453
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:13,080
And I was grounded for a month.

454
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:16,150
Tell me which letter you see.

455
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:18,019
I mean are we...
This is how we're starting?

456
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:20,121
Tell me what letter you see.

457
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:21,689
Q.

458
00:25:21,722 --> 00:25:23,691
And now?
- VANESSA: E.

459
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:25,960
(Grunts)

460
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:28,162
Jennifer's favorite movie
was Fight Club.

461
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,296
(Grunts)

462
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,165
VANESSA: I don't know
where this one's coming from.

463
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:32,767
Oh, summer boot camp!

464
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,135
We quit June 1st.

465
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:36,303
(Thud)

466
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:38,873
(Pees)

467
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:42,943
(Device beeps)

468
00:25:42,977 --> 00:25:46,347
Subject bladder evacuation speed
below average.

469
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,882
Well, just give me a second.

470
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:49,116
I can get one more second out.

471
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,355
(Urine drips)

472
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:55,956
Dammit.

473
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,893
Okay, am I following you,
'cause I'm not doing that.

474
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:02,563
What are you doing?

475
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:06,967
Now, I will be performing
an audio me try evaluation.

476
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:07,835
Please turn around.

477
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:12,339
Identify where the sound
is coming from.

478
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:15,976
I don't hear any... left.

479
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,311
- (Device beeps)
- Right.

480
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:18,612
- (Device beeps)
- Right again.

481
00:26:18,646 --> 00:26:20,047
- (Device beeps)
- Both sides now.

482
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:23,284
- (Device beeps)
- Adult female hearing, average.

483
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:27,188
What? I was just being playful.

484
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:30,991
- (Device beeps)
- Adult female being playful.

485
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:33,160
Okay, what's next?

486
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:35,930
- Oh!
- (Water splashes)

487
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:37,932
- Aquatic Agility Assessment.
- (Vanessa grunts)

488
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,701
What are you doing?

489
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,069
I am being playful.

490
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:45,639
(Sighs)

491
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:47,341
Are you trying to s... smile?

492
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:48,709
Am I succeeding?

493
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:51,912
No. No.

494
00:26:51,946 --> 00:26:53,147
(Water ripples)

495
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:59,120
- All right, so...
- Like don't suck your bottom lip under your whole mouth.

496
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:02,723
(Pulls at her teeth)

497
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,391
What are we doing?

498
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:05,594
What are we doing right now?

499
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:09,263
- Aquatic agility analysis.
- Then, let's start. Let's start.

500
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:13,334
(Water sloshes)

501
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:16,270
(Pants)

502
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:17,905
45 seconds.

503
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:18,772
Nice.

504
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:20,174
(Device beeps)

505
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:23,277
Lung capacity of human female
minimally above average.

506
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,912
Oh.

507
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:26,247
And don't you forget it.

508
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,882
No, please do not touch this.

509
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:28,883
Oh, sorry.

510
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:31,185
I didn't mean
to touch your recorder thingy.

511
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:33,254
Why are you still here,
by the way?

512
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:34,989
Shouldn't you have disappeared
by now?

513
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,659
I am not sure how you have come
to this conclusion.

514
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,328
I said my goodbyes to Jennifer.

515
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:42,863
I mourned her.

516
00:27:42,897 --> 00:27:45,900
I mean I'm... I'm good unless...

517
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:48,435
Oh, is there something
that she needs to tell me

518
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:50,237
before she can cross over?

519
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:51,071
JENNIFER:
Oh!

520
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:54,041
No, I am afraid
oxygen deprivation

521
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:55,142
has confused you.

522
00:27:55,176 --> 00:27:57,077
I am not a ghost.

523
00:27:57,111 --> 00:27:59,213
Shall we do orientation
once more?

524
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:00,047
No, no. No, no, no.

525
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,081
We're good. We're good.

526
00:28:01,115 --> 00:28:01,949
You're not a ghost. Noted.

527
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,952
You wanna see me do
a cannonball?

528
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:07,922
Like Jennifer did at the end
of every swim meet?

529
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:11,992
Yes, which is exactly why I am
hallucinating this scenario.

530
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:16,063
JENNIFER:
Your dad came to every meet.

531
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:17,164
VANESSA:
Yeah.

532
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:18,199
God, he was so embarrassing.

533
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:22,736
JENNIFER: Jennifer's dad
never came to a swim meet.

534
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,972
He did not even know
she was on the team.

535
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:26,006
He knew.

536
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,309
He just uh, didn't care.

537
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,011
Same for the funeral.

538
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:34,048
All right, time this one.

539
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:35,783

540
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:37,384

541
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:55,836
(Takes a deep breath)

542
00:28:58,138 --> 00:28:59,840
VANESSA:
Do you eat?

543
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:02,876
JENNIFER: It is not
necessary for survival,

544
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,212
but I am capable of doing so.

545
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:07,081
On my planet,
we receive sustenance

546
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:09,783
via injection of vitamins.

547
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:11,519
The human body
is gravely inefficient

548
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:13,187
at processing nutrients.

549
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,957
VANESSA: It's not about
processing nutrients.

550
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:20,060
I really like cooking.

551
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:21,262
Something about it calms me.

552
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:23,531
It's the predictability
or something.

553
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:27,301
You mix flour with sugar,
you're gonna make cookies.

554
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:30,871
Well, there's other steps
in between, but you get it.

555
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:34,208
Your soda recipe was a mistake.

556
00:29:35,376 --> 00:29:36,277
Not my mistake.

557
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:39,280
Jennifer?

558
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:39,847
Yeah.

559
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,915
Uh, it was a decent soda

560
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:45,853
before Jennifer accidentally
put way too much ginger in it,

561
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:49,456
and then it was just um,
too good to deny.

562
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,560
That's Jennifer.

563
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:54,461
(Birds chirping in distance)

564
00:29:56,564 --> 00:29:58,198
VANESSA:
Hmm. Oh.

565
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:02,903
(Munches)

566
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:06,140
You just put the whole thing in?

567
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,377
How's it going? Eating food?

568
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:15,482
Jennifer's memories indicate
you were a chef,

569
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:19,353
but the flavors and textures
of that small sandwich

570
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:24,124
are causing positive explosions
of saliva in my mouth!

571
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,594
VANESSA:
That's... that's good.

572
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:32,366
Human sense memory inferior
to present experience.

573
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:34,602

00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:46,013
JENNIFER:
What is that cracking sound?

579
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:47,314
I'm 36.

580
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:50,317
Elevate your arms.

581
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,453
Move your head
on a vertical axis.

582
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:53,822

Yes, that's where this is from.

586
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:06,534
Papa Roach, middle School.

587
00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:07,535
We were obsessed with them.

588
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:09,136
(Takes a deep breath)

589
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:11,506
When we finally saw them
in concert,

590
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:13,907
oh, Jennifer pulled me
into the mosh pit,

591
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:16,443
and I immediately
got a black eye.

592
00:31:16,477 --> 00:31:19,246
Oh, my mom was pissed,
but it was amazing.

593

00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:22,249

(Chuckles)

596
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:26,253
- Jennifer enjoyed that evening also.
- Yeah.

597
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:29,923
I mean that was
our first time seeing them,

598
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,158
so we talked about it
for months.

599
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:34,629
It was not
Jennifer's first time.

600
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:37,565
What?

601
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:42,202
She saw them the year before
with her sister.

602
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,304
No, she... no, she didn't.

603
00:31:44,338 --> 00:31:45,272
She did.

604
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,374
No, she, uh...

605
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,544
She would have told me.

606
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:52,212
She never told you.

607
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,481
Why wouldn't she tell me?

608
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:55,949
She wouldn't lie to me.

609
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,619
Her memories indicate
she lied to you,

610
00:31:57,652 --> 00:31:59,153
because she felt
telling you the truth

611
00:31:59,186 --> 00:32:00,087
would hurt you.

612
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:10,532
JENNIFER:
No, please do not leave again.

613
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:13,033
No, I just... I have to pee again

614
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:14,569

have that research,

615
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:15,737

go see Papa Roach

<i>It was so hard
not to say anything</i>

634
00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:03,116
<i>when you guys went on and on
about that night you saw them.</i>

635
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,418
<i>When did she tell you?</i>

636
00:33:06,788 --> 00:33:10,792
<i>Um, earlier this year.</i>

637
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:13,293
Actually, uh,
I thought she was just tryin'

638
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:14,762
to piss me off.

to the grave.</i>

00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:17,725

00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:45,099
(Device beeps)

718
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,601
Extreme levels of stress

719
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:48,703
caused by minor deviation
in plan.

720
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:51,304
It's not a minor deviation,
we are stranded.

721
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:53,406
Except for this person.

722
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:57,344
There are vehicles passing by
that are not electric.

723
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:59,412
We could ask for transportation.

724
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:00,815
No, I'm not doing that.

725
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:02,617
Jennifer's memories indicate

726
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,752
that this will
lure male drivers.

727
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:05,820
VANESSA:
What are you do... s... no, no!

728
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:06,654
Put that down.

729
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:08,455
Get out of the road.

730
00:38:08,488 --> 00:38:09,657
No.

731
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,825
The only people
who pick up hitchhikers

732
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:11,759
are murderers.

733
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:12,693
Thank you.

734
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:17,665
I should be home with Eric
watching him practice

735
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:19,499
on his stupid fucking bass!

736
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:21,903
(Device beeps)

737
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:24,337
Human has turned anger
onto herself

738
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:26,908
and Eric's stupid fucking bass.

739
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:29,442
We're walking. We're walking!

740
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:30,845
We cannot walk back.

741
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:32,780
We're walking, that's the plan.

742
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:34,414
JENNIFER:
I cannot walk.

743
00:38:34,447 --> 00:38:36,517
Why? Why? Why?

744
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:39,053
(Skin squelches)

745
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:40,387
Oh, that's gross.

746
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:44,992
I have been too long
without oil.

747
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:47,460
(Vehicle whirring in background)

748
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:48,428
Oh, shit.

749
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:55,036
Hello!

750
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,406
[engine stops]

751
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:02,342
Hey, y'all need a jump?

752
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:04,946
Um, no. No, we're good.

753
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:06,413
Thank you.

754
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:09,617
Hey,
you wanna bum another smoke?

755
00:39:10,551 --> 00:39:13,020
Oh, yes. Hello. No, I'm good.

756
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:16,090
We're... we're pretty good
across the board, so thank you.

757
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:17,490
All right.

758
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:18,826
Nice seeing you again.

759
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:21,394
- No.
- It's fine. Just...

760
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:22,730
- No.
- Okay. All right.

761
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:27,068
Um, actually,
could I use your cell phone

762
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:28,536
to call Triple A?

763
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:31,873
Uh, Triple A is a scam. No dice.

764
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:35,442
If you need a tow, I'll go ahead
and call one of my friends.

765
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:37,410
No, no, I think we're uh, good.

766
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:38,913
Vanessa.

767
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:41,716
This man is offering aid,
which is what we are in need of.

768
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:43,450
He wants to help.

769
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:45,519
Yeah,
he wants to help murder us.

770
00:39:45,987 --> 00:39:47,755
Murder is not really my thing.

771
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:49,824
Mm, I didn't realize
I said that so loud.

772
00:39:49,857 --> 00:39:51,158
Exceptional news!

773
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,761
Holy!

774
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:55,563
Is this
one of those computer cars?

775
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:57,098
Uh, yes,
but don't touch it, please.

776
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:58,065
- BEARDED MAN: Oh, my gosh!
- Okay.

777
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:00,201
BEARDED MAN:
This is some high fancy crap!

778
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,837
It's actually my boyfriend's uh,
car.

779
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:06,974
Yeah, he's super strong
and it has a tracking device,

780
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:08,910
so he knows
where we are right now.

781
00:40:08,943 --> 00:40:10,711
Also, he plays bass.

782
00:40:10,745 --> 00:40:12,914
Uh, he sounds
like a pretty cool dude.

783
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:17,218
Uh, hey, I got a buddy Marcus
who's a huge nerd.

784
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:18,686
I guarantee
he could hack this thing

785
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,520
in like 20 seconds.

786
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:21,789
Umm, I don't think we need a
nerd.

787
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:22,790
No, I think we're good.

788
00:40:22,823 --> 00:40:24,225
No Marcus, I think.

789
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:25,559
- BEARDED MAN: Okay.
- Yeah?

790
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:27,561
I'm gonna go ahead and text him.

791
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:28,896
- JENNIFER: Vanessa.
- VANESSA: Hmm.

792
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,497
JENNIFER:
What does it feel like?

793
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:31,699
What?

794
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:33,067
To be unreasonable.

795
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,435
I'm not unreasonable,
we don't know this man.

796
00:40:36,837 --> 00:40:37,638
You're an alien.

797
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:41,008
Can't you just beam us up,
Scotty?

798
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,477
I do not know
what is beam us up, Scotty,

799
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:46,479
but I do not think I can do it.

800
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:48,015
(Sighs)

801
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:49,449
JENNIFER:
I am parched.

802
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,087
These are pestering me.

803
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,988
Just leave them alone.

804
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:55,022
Your eyebrows.

805
00:40:56,057 --> 00:40:58,092
Uh, is this a TV in here?

806
00:40:58,125 --> 00:40:58,960
What are you doing?

807
00:40:58,993 --> 00:41:00,661
Can you watch TV
while you're driving?

808
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:02,129
No! You can't...
Sh... shoo, shoo, shoo.

809
00:41:02,163 --> 00:41:03,731
All right. Dang!

810
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:04,732
(Phone beeps)

811
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:06,701
Oh, hey.

812
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:08,803
Marcus said his shift is
about to end.

813
00:41:08,836 --> 00:41:10,271
He could be here in 25 minutes.

814
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,472
Vanessa, my skin is boiling.

815
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,543
I need oil.

816
00:41:15,576 --> 00:41:17,044
If he kills us,
I'm gonna be pissed.

817
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:20,247
25? Is that what you said?

818
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:20,948
BEARDED MAN:
Yeah.

819
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:22,616
Great. We'll wait for Marcus.

820
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,019
(Phone beeps)

821
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:26,754
You guys want any Subway?

822
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:28,622
Um, I don't think we...

823
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:29,991
I... I think we're good.

824
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:32,760
All right,
I'm gonna get cold cut trio.

825
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:37,631
(Birds chirping in distance)

826
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:46,874
It's a rad jacket.

827
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,112
Hey, so what's your name?

828
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,116
Vane... la.

829
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:58,152
What brings you out here,
Vanilla?

830
00:42:01,255 --> 00:42:02,256
VANESSA:
I'm celebrating.

831
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:05,259
BEARDED MAN:
What's the occasion?

832
00:42:08,963 --> 00:42:09,797
VANESSA:
Do you really care?

833
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,632
We don't have to do this.

834
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:13,034
Yeah, I care.

835
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:20,007
A distribution deal.

836
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:22,576
For what?

837
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:26,981
My friend and I
made an organic soda.

838
00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:29,250
BEARDED MAN:
Organic soda.

839
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:31,185
Like you put grass in it
or whatever?

840
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:35,056
What? No, it's just natural
ingredients.

841
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:36,323
Oh,
I probably wouldn't like that.

842
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:38,726
That's fine.

843
00:42:40,895 --> 00:42:43,731
BEARDED MAN:
So is the party over?

844
00:42:43,764 --> 00:42:47,268
No, uh, it never started
because of my partner.

845
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:48,335
Oh.

846
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,639
They screw you over
or something?

847
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:54,575
Yeah. She died.

848
00:42:58,179 --> 00:42:59,246
Uh.

849
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:02,750
I'm sorry to hear that.

850
00:43:04,385 --> 00:43:05,653
How did she croak?

851
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:08,322
Hole in the heart.

852
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:10,925
No one knew.

853
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,928
She had a stroke.

854
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,632
And now, you have a hole
in your heart.

855
00:43:20,201 --> 00:43:22,937
You have a hole in your heart,
'cause you missed a great party.

856
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,238
(Man chuckles)

857
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:25,840
That's so stupid.

858
00:43:25,873 --> 00:43:27,341
I can't believe
I just laughed at that.

859
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:32,813
BEARDED MAN: So, did you guys have
a clause in your shareholders agreement

860
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:35,282
in case of the event
of the death of a partner?

861
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:39,820
Are you a businessman?

862
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:41,856
Yeah.

863
00:43:42,923 --> 00:43:43,691
Really?

864
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:44,291
(Chuckles)

865
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:44,892
BEARDED MAN:
Yeah.

866
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:45,926
All right.

867
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,629
Uh, no, we didn't have that.

868
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,433
So, what are you gonna do now?

869
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:53,834
I don't know.

870
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,706
That's not true.

871
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:00,374
I'm dissolving her half
of the business

872
00:44:00,407 --> 00:44:03,878
and I'm...
I'll own all the shares.

873
00:44:05,412 --> 00:44:08,816
And now you have to
run the whole thing by yourself.

874
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:14,188
Man,
she really did screw you over.

875
00:44:17,057 --> 00:44:18,292
Yeah, she really did.

876
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:22,930
(Phone beeps)

877
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:25,900
Hey, Marcus.

878
00:44:27,268 --> 00:44:31,205
No, we're on Highway 51,
at the mile marker, uh... uh...

879
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,343
Marcus? Marcus?

880
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:40,347
My phone died.

881
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:42,016
I... I just charged this.

882
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,019
I can give you guys a ride.

883
00:44:46,754 --> 00:44:48,122
Hop in.

884
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:49,323
Do you have seat belts?

885
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:50,257
BEARDED MAN:
No.

886
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:55,196
(Truck whirs)

887
00:44:55,229 --> 00:45:03,229
(♪♪♪)

888
00:45:14,248 --> 00:45:22,248
(♪♪♪)

889
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:41,267
(♪♪♪)

890
00:45:52,286 --> 00:46:00,286
(♪♪♪)

891
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:10,304
(Truck whirs)

892
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:12,139
This is good. Thanks.

893
00:46:14,308 --> 00:46:16,243
Hey, as soon as my phone
comes back online,

894
00:46:16,277 --> 00:46:18,178
I'll call Marcus
and have him drop the car here.

895
00:46:19,213 --> 00:46:21,448
Oh, great. Thank you so much.

896
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:22,950
You've been very helpful.

897
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:23,951
BEARDED MAN:
Yeah, no problem.

898
00:46:24,885 --> 00:46:25,819
Hey!

899
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:26,887
Yeah.

900
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:29,223
She's not comin' back.

901
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:33,160
What the fuck?

902
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:38,866
(Tire screeches)

903
00:46:40,568 --> 00:46:43,304
(Truck whirs)

904
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:50,010
(Door shuts)

905
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:56,884
JENNIFER: Vanessa, did you see
the hues of the sunset on our way back?

906
00:46:58,218 --> 00:47:00,354
I have never seen anything
that beautiful.

907
00:47:01,121 --> 00:47:02,222
(Glass clunks)

908
00:47:02,256 --> 00:47:03,857
JENNIFER:
They were pink and gold.

909
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,027
It made my skin tingle.

910
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:10,197
(Pours drink)

911
00:47:15,336 --> 00:47:16,470
(Device beeps)

912
00:47:16,504 --> 00:47:18,005
Although,
we have arrived to base safely,

913
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:19,541
the human
has not yet de-escalated

914
00:47:19,574 --> 00:47:20,407
from previous incident.

915
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:21,342
Will you stop
with that fucking thing?

916
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,443
Just stop!

917
00:47:24,512 --> 00:47:27,147
This weekend
has been exhausting.

918
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:29,850
You are draining me
like you drained my car.

919
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:32,520
Vanessa, I am not supposed
to interfere

920
00:47:32,554 --> 00:47:34,021
with your emotive response,

921
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:36,558
but I do think
you may be overreacting.

922
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:38,926
I'm overreacting. Me?

923
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,994
This is not about me,
this is about you.

924
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:43,931
You drained my car
and you forced us

925
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:45,999
to go into a vehicle
with a stranger!

926
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:47,901
We don't know him.

927
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:50,003
And now,
he knows where we're staying,

928
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,405
he has my car.

929
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:52,306
We will be safe.

930
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:55,109
You don't know that, Jen!

931
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:02,983
I apologize.

932
00:48:07,655 --> 00:48:08,623
Thank you.

933
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,259
JENNIFER:
We could eat something.

934
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:13,460
Eating is the best.

935
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:15,462
Sit.

936
00:48:15,496 --> 00:48:16,463
Relax.

937
00:48:17,164 --> 00:48:18,999
Take a sip of...

938
00:48:19,032 --> 00:48:20,702
What is that?

939
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,570
Vodka and tequila.

940
00:48:22,604 --> 00:48:25,573
Okay, take a sip of your vodka
and tequila.

941
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:27,509
I will create a snack.

942
00:48:38,753 --> 00:48:41,188
(Cutlery clinking in background)

943
00:48:52,232 --> 00:48:53,367
(Glass clunks)

944
00:48:54,636 --> 00:48:56,036
I'm sorry.

945
00:48:57,438 --> 00:49:02,042
I think that that guy just um,
really freaked me out.

946
00:49:03,177 --> 00:49:04,311
And um...

947
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:17,991
(Door opens and shuts
in background)

948
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:21,596
(Flicking lighter)

949
00:49:23,464 --> 00:49:26,133
(Water rippling)

950
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,555
Stop it. Stop!

951
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:58,232
I know you were just trying
to help with that candy face.

952
00:50:02,436 --> 00:50:04,004
I thought
that would make you happy.

953
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:08,510
Because Jennifer used to do it
for me when I was sad.

954
00:50:10,077 --> 00:50:11,245
You have that memory.

955
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:12,346
I know, but...

956
00:50:14,214 --> 00:50:17,084
You're not Jennifer, are you?

957
00:50:19,554 --> 00:50:21,054
I am not.

958
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:29,496
I think in that moment
I just realized that...

959
00:50:31,866 --> 00:50:33,200
Jennifer's never gonna make me

960
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:35,035
one of those stupid faces again.

961
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:40,642
We're never gonna
do anything together again.

962
00:50:45,312 --> 00:50:47,314
We were supposed
to get rich together

963
00:50:49,283 --> 00:50:53,086
and go to France
and Australia together.

964
00:50:58,325 --> 00:51:00,394
Our kids were supposed
to fall in love with each other.

965
00:51:03,865 --> 00:51:08,435
We're supposed to grow old
and go flirt with the servers

966
00:51:08,468 --> 00:51:11,338
at IHOP
for free stuffed French toast.

967
00:51:19,146 --> 00:51:20,548
She's never coming back.

968
00:51:24,852 --> 00:51:28,155
(Insects chirping in background)

969
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:56,751
You were not going to do
any of that.

970
00:51:58,285 --> 00:51:59,854
(Sniffles)

971
00:51:59,887 --> 00:52:00,822
What?

972
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:04,458
You were not going to
grow old together.

973
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:07,662
What are you talking about?

974
00:52:07,695 --> 00:52:10,263
You were going to
have an argument.

975
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:11,431
VANESSA:
I don't understand.

976
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:14,902
Can you see the future
or something?

977
00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:15,837
Yes.

978
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:20,708
You would have fought.

979
00:52:20,742 --> 00:52:22,777
You would have fought
at this event.

980
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:23,611
VANESSA:
So, what?

981
00:52:23,645 --> 00:52:25,479
We would have fought
at this event

982
00:52:25,513 --> 00:52:27,782
and then
we would have gotten over it.

983
00:52:27,815 --> 00:52:28,783
No.

984
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:32,754
You would have
never seen each other again.

985
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:42,697
(Doorbell rings)

986
00:52:47,267 --> 00:52:49,537
You said he wasn't
gonna come back to kill us.

987
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,338
(Doorbell rings)

988
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:57,411
JENNIFER: Do murderers
usually ring a doorbell?

989
00:52:57,444 --> 00:52:58,746
VANESSA:
Who is it?

990
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,848
DJ TWISTED BRISTLE:
DJ Twisted Bristle!

991
00:53:00,882 --> 00:53:02,950
(DJ vocalizes)

992
00:53:02,984 --> 00:53:03,785
(Chuckles)

993
00:53:03,818 --> 00:53:05,385
Yo, yo!

994
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:07,454
Why am I forgetting everything?

995
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:09,356
Uh, where should I set up?

996
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:10,992
Uh, we don't need a DJ.

997
00:53:11,025 --> 00:53:12,426
I forgot to cancel you

998
00:53:12,459 --> 00:53:14,494
like I forgot
to cancel the party.

999
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:15,697
DJ TWISTED BRISTLE:
What?

1000
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,264
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1001
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:18,398
Oh, okay.

1002
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:21,401
Uh, yeah, no... no worries. Cool.

1003
00:53:21,435 --> 00:53:22,870
Uh, all right.

1004
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:28,241
Jennifer's memories indicate
that DJs are fun.

1005
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:29,644
Yeah, but it's weird
to have a DJ play

1006
00:53:29,677 --> 00:53:30,712
for just the two of us.

1007
00:53:30,745 --> 00:53:31,813
Oh, I got that song.

1008
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:32,747
Just the...

1009
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,848
(Hums)

1010
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:34,414
Yeah,
which one do you wannna hear?

1011
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:35,415
The Will Smith version

1012
00:53:35,449 --> 00:53:37,384
or the Dr. Evil
and the little guy version,

1013
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:38,686
'cause I got them both.

1014
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,621
No, I just meant that it's weird
to have a DJ play

1015
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:42,757
for clearly no one.

1016
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:44,759
Oh, right. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1017
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:46,561
Well, if you're worried about
like not havin' a crowd,

1018
00:53:46,594 --> 00:53:48,629
I can have my boys here
like in 10 minutes tops.

1019
00:53:48,663 --> 00:53:49,831
Absolutely not.

1020
00:53:49,864 --> 00:53:51,532
Right, no,
they're probably busy, so yeah.

1021
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:52,633
(DJ Clears throat)

1022
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,739
So should I go or...

1023
00:53:58,806 --> 00:53:59,907
Have I paid you already?

1024
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:00,775
DJ TWISTED BRISTLE:
You did.

1025
00:54:00,808 --> 00:54:03,511
You paid me already, but no tip,
so...

1026
00:54:04,712 --> 00:54:06,647
I do still need
to study the physical effects

1027
00:54:06,681 --> 00:54:08,649
of increased serotonin levels.

1028
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:11,485
I doubt a DJ is gonna
to increase my serotonin levels.

1029
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,656
Oh, that's where you're wrong,
because uh, you know why?

1030
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,424
I got molly.

1031
00:54:23,531 --> 00:54:24,065
Screw it.

1032
00:54:24,098 --> 00:54:24,866
Hell yeah!

1033
00:54:24,899 --> 00:54:25,800
(Laughs)

1034
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:26,634
No, not inside the house.

1035
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:27,635
Just through the back.

1036
00:54:27,668 --> 00:54:29,704
Hell no! Yeah.

1037
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:31,672
Vanessa,
did you see that jacket?

1038
00:54:31,706 --> 00:54:33,941
I did.

1039
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:41,975

1040

1041
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:54,896
Tiny pill with woman's name
causes elation and...

1042
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:56,564
Jennifer stopped doing that.

1043
00:54:56,597 --> 00:54:57,632
Okay!

1044
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:05,540
This body seems to be designed
for dancing.

1045
00:55:10,377 --> 00:55:12,079
You're smiling
and it looks natural!

1046
00:55:12,113 --> 00:55:14,414
I am getting used to the bones
in my mouth!

1047
00:55:16,383 --> 00:55:17,685
DJ TWISTED BRISTLE:
Drug, am I right?

1048
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:20,555
Drugs!

1049
00:55:21,756 --> 00:55:23,390
I wanna go somewhere else!

1050
00:55:23,423 --> 00:55:24,992
Okay!

1051

1054
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:35,102
Do you know about corn?

1055
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:37,038
The food or the band?

1056
00:55:37,071 --> 00:55:39,707
C-O-R-N.

1057
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,976
Hmm, the food.

1058
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:44,111
I do know some things.

1059
00:55:44,145 --> 00:55:49,650
I know that it's on a cob
and you can pop it.

1060
00:55:49,684 --> 00:55:52,153
We believe it
is another alien species

1061
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:54,121
living on your planet in secret.

1062
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:55,823
Shit. For real?

1063
00:55:55,857 --> 00:55:57,390
It is a theory.

1064
00:55:57,424 --> 00:55:58,960
(Sighs)

1065
00:55:58,993 --> 00:56:00,161
I'm still thirsty.

1066
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:01,596
Can I have that?

1067
00:56:01,629 --> 00:56:03,064
Yes.

Mm.

Jennifer did,

No one has ever given me
anything.

It feels...

1137
01:00:17,318 --> 01:00:18,819
I feel...

1138
01:00:21,755 --> 01:00:23,090
I don't know.

1139
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:28,129
I never experienced emotions.

1140
01:00:28,162 --> 01:00:30,231
No one on my planet has.

1141
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:35,169
It is believed to be the reason
we are ahead of your species.

Jen, you totally have feelings,

1143
01:00:41,842 --> 01:00:45,045
but something about your planet
doesn't let you access them.

1144

has developed emotions in me.

How does it feel
to feel the feelings?

1148
01:01:03,063 --> 01:01:05,833
I do not have the words
to explain.

1149
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:11,005
Yeah, I don't know either.

01:01:17,011 --> 01:01:19,713
the sun will rise and set again
tomorrow.

1152
01:01:21,415 --> 01:01:24,852
Yeah. It does that every day.

Oh, my God.

I thought you were gone.

1178
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:59,373
I was for a moment,
but I have returned.

We did not reach the store
yesterday,

1182
01:04:05,212 --> 01:04:08,182
so I went and got your soda
from the store.

1183
01:04:08,215 --> 01:04:10,417
Here is the receipt,
so that you can see.

Thank you.

1186
01:04:14,988 --> 01:04:16,624
I hitchhiked there and back.

1187
01:04:16,658 --> 01:04:19,126
I know you do not like that,
so I went alone.

1188

Okay. Come on.

01:04:48,355 --> 01:04:50,124
I also bought olive oil,

1196

You have?

1213
01:05:58,192 --> 01:06:01,028
I finished organizing everything
early this morning,

1214
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:03,397
so that we did not have to work

1215
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:05,132
and we could
spend the day together

1216
01:06:05,165 --> 01:06:06,734

you were leaving tomorrow.

No.

1220
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:19,279
I leave tonight at 11:32 p.m.,

exactly 48 hours
after I arrived.

1222
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:26,588
Okay, but uh, we didn't meet
till the next morning,

1223
01:06:26,621 --> 01:06:29,691
so shouldn't they, I don't know,
start the clock there?

1224
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:32,493
They do not.

1225
01:06:33,661 --> 01:06:35,229
Why not?

You know, you come here

who are already going through
the worst shit of their lives.

1231
01:07:01,623 --> 01:07:03,257
It's not a good plan.

1232
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,424
You should rethink it.

1233
01:07:09,196 --> 01:07:10,832
I did not torture you.

1234
01:07:10,865 --> 01:07:11,933
I would never do that.

1235
01:07:11,966 --> 01:07:16,036

You guys are like...
You're like...

You can't just figure me out
in 48 hours.

1254
01:08:03,483 --> 01:08:04,451
That's nuts.

1255
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:07,755
It's less than 48 hours,
by the way, technically.

1256
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:12,492
Oh!

1257
01:08:12,527 --> 01:08:13,360
This is just like you.

1258
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:14,562
This is just like you!

1259
01:08:14,596 --> 01:08:15,663
You're always cutting corners!

1260
01:08:15,697 --> 01:08:16,831
You're just like this!

1261
01:08:16,864 --> 01:08:18,566
Like this.

1262
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,569
I haven't seen Two Rings
on the shelves.

1263
01:08:21,603 --> 01:08:22,837
All you did was
bring me something

1264
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:25,773
I've seen a million times
and some trash.

1265
01:08:25,807 --> 01:08:26,774
(Clunk)

1266
01:08:36,383 --> 01:08:37,819
I did not think about that.

1267
01:08:37,852 --> 01:08:39,787
Yeah, you don't think.

1268
01:08:39,821 --> 01:08:41,488
This is exactly why
I didn't take

1269
01:08:41,522 --> 01:08:43,625
that distribution deal
six years ago.

1270
01:08:48,596 --> 01:08:49,897
You feel guilt?

1271
01:08:50,898 --> 01:08:55,469
We could have had this party
six years ago!

1272
01:08:55,502 --> 01:08:57,270
We could have been
doing business together

1273
01:08:57,304 --> 01:08:58,740
for six years!

1274
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:02,577
And maybe...

1275
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,311
JENNIFER:
What are you saying?

1276
01:09:04,344 --> 01:09:05,747
That she would have lived?

1277
01:09:08,816 --> 01:09:11,586
Maybe she would have had
enough money

1278
01:09:11,619 --> 01:09:13,286
for good health insurance,

1279
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,589
and she could have had
a physical,

1280
01:09:14,622 --> 01:09:16,390
and they would have
seen her heart.

1281
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,195
That would not have
changed anything.

1282
01:09:23,363 --> 01:09:25,533
W... it... it wouldn't have?

1283
01:09:25,566 --> 01:09:26,934
You tell me.

1284
01:09:26,968 --> 01:09:28,368
You're the one
who could see the future.

1285
01:09:28,402 --> 01:09:30,672
Would...
If we had taken the offer,

1286
01:09:30,705 --> 01:09:32,940
would she still be alive?

1287
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:39,747
I do not know.

1288
01:09:41,883 --> 01:09:43,851
I do not see the future.

1289
01:09:45,419 --> 01:09:46,788
I lied to you.

1290
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:49,924
Why would you lie to me?

1291
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:52,426
Why would you do that?

1292
01:09:53,628 --> 01:09:55,495
Because you were crying.

1293
01:09:57,765 --> 01:09:59,901
Jennifer lied to you,
so you would not hurt,

1294
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:02,737
so I lied to you,
so you would not hurt.

1295
01:10:04,337 --> 01:10:05,506
I was emotional.

1296
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:06,774
That is the problem.

1297
01:10:06,808 --> 01:10:09,811
I cannot
start feeling like this.

1298
01:10:09,844 --> 01:10:10,511
(Device beeping)

1299
01:10:10,545 --> 01:10:12,613
VANESSA:
What are you doing?

1300
01:10:12,647 --> 01:10:13,981
What are you doing?

1301
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,884
I should have not allowed myself
to get close to you.

1302
01:10:16,918 --> 01:10:18,318
(Device beeping)

1303
01:10:18,351 --> 01:10:19,620
What... what is that?

1304
01:10:19,654 --> 01:10:20,855
What did you do?

1305
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:23,024
I have some in my superiors
to retrieve me.

1306
01:10:23,057 --> 01:10:24,458
They will reward me

1307
01:10:24,491 --> 01:10:25,793
for completing my assignment
early.

1308
01:10:25,827 --> 01:10:26,761
Reward you with what?

1309
01:10:26,794 --> 01:10:28,495
An extra vitamin injection?

1310
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:29,463
Maybe!

1311
01:10:30,765 --> 01:10:32,033
Turn it off!

1312
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:32,700
JENNIFER:
No!

1313
01:10:32,734 --> 01:10:33,300
Cancel it!

1314
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:34,535
It cannot be cancelled!

1315
01:10:34,569 --> 01:10:36,003
We were gonna hang out!

1316
01:10:36,037 --> 01:10:38,740
We have like eight more hours,
that's a lot.

1317
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:49,684
I am sorry!

1318
01:10:59,861 --> 01:11:01,896
Jennifer, don't do that, please.

1319
01:11:12,874 --> 01:11:14,341
I am not Jennifer.

1320
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:25,318

1321
01:11:25,352 --> 01:11:26,020
JENNIFER:

(Grunts)

1324
01:11:29,724 --> 01:11:31,726
JENNIFER:
Your efforts are futile.

1325
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:33,761
VANESSA:
Not going home!

1326
01:11:33,795 --> 01:11:35,395
JENNIFER:
It is indestructible.

1327
01:11:35,428 --> 01:11:36,597
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

1328
01:11:36,631 --> 01:11:37,632
Check this out.

1329
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,433

1331
01:11:45,807 --> 01:11:47,942
No! No!

1332
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:51,411
The device is programmed
to return to me.

1333
01:11:51,444 --> 01:11:53,014
That's a stupid thing
for your device to do

1334
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:54,949
and you're a...
You're a stupid alien.

1335
01:11:57,151 --> 01:11:59,486
That is the last thing
you want to say to me?

1336
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,555
No! No!

1337
01:12:00,588 --> 01:12:01,756
I also want to say,

1338
01:12:03,423 --> 01:12:05,092
"F you and F your planet!"

1339
01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:07,829

(Door opens)

1344
01:12:31,418 --> 01:12:35,790
Wait! No! No, no, no!

1345
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:36,791
What are you doing?

1346
01:12:36,824 --> 01:12:39,327
No, don't take her yet.

1347
01:12:41,762 --> 01:12:45,398
Vanessa, that is an airplane
from Earth.

1348
01:12:48,603 --> 01:12:52,039
(Pants)

1349
01:12:56,476 --> 01:12:58,779
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1350
01:13:00,514 --> 01:13:01,983
(Sighs)

1351
01:13:02,016 --> 01:13:04,552
I ruin everything.

1352
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:06,419
I should have just
spent the day with you.

1353
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,925
I have regrets as well.

1354
01:13:14,829 --> 01:13:16,697
I reacted impulsively.

1355
01:13:17,965 --> 01:13:20,067
I wish I had not
summoned them early.

1356
01:13:22,036 --> 01:13:23,671
I messed up with Jennifer.

1357
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:28,142
I should have had more fun
with her when she was here.

1358
01:13:29,977 --> 01:13:31,512
Said "yes" more.

1359
01:13:34,715 --> 01:13:36,416
She loved you, Vanessa.

1360
01:13:38,152 --> 01:13:40,521
It is not complicated
to see why.

1361
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:43,925
I know she loved me.

1362
01:13:47,494 --> 01:13:49,096
We would have been
best friends forever.

1363
01:13:54,568 --> 01:13:55,870
(Sighs)

1364
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:05,579
Would you like to hug Jennifer
one last time?

1365
01:14:08,983 --> 01:14:10,518
Jennifer is gone.

1366
01:14:12,019 --> 01:14:15,790
(Roaring in distance)

1367
01:14:18,626 --> 01:14:20,227

1369

1370
01:14:30,838 --> 01:14:32,106
I am sure.

1371
01:14:33,808 --> 01:14:35,743
But now, I look forward
to seeing the sunset

1372
01:14:35,776 --> 01:14:37,511
on my own planet.

1373
01:14:40,047 --> 01:14:41,882
Now, I have to lose you.

1374
01:14:44,685 --> 01:14:47,822
What we once enjoyed,
we can never lose.

1375
01:14:47,855 --> 01:14:51,092
All that we love
becomes a part of us.

1377
01:15:08,209 --> 01:15:09,744

01:15:09,777 --> 01:15:12,747
I wanna grab something,
so you don't forget me.
