0
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:36,478
- Is this on?
- That's fine.

1
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:38,810
I can break through walls,
I just can't...

2
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:41,349
- That's fine.
- I can't get this on.

3
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:44,352
So, Mr. Incredible...
Do you have a secret identity?

4
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,789
Every superhero has a secret identity.
I don't know a single one who doesn't.

5
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:52,055
Who wants the pressure
of being super all the time?

6
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,996
Of course I have a secret identity.

7
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:59,364
Can you see me in this
at the supermarket? Come on.

8
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:02,268
Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl,
know what I mean?

9
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:07,902
Superladies, they're always trying
to tell you their secret identity.

10
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:11,310
Think it'll strengthen
the relationship or something.

11
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,750
I said, "Girl, I don't want to know
about your mild-mannered alter ego."

12
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:21,347
I mean, you tell me you're
a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe,

13
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:25,120
that's all right with me.
I'm good. I'm good.

14
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,922
No matter how many times
you save the world,

15
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:31,291
it always manages to get back
in jeopardy again.

16
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:34,821
Sometimes I just want it to stay saved,
you know?

17
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:38,266
For a little bit. I feel like the maid.
"I just cleaned up this mess.

18
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:40,861
Can we keep it clean
for ten minutes?"

19
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,373
- I could get to that point.
- "Please?"

20
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:45,705
Don't get up. We're not finished.

21
00:01:45,777 --> 00:01:49,144
Sometimes I think I'd just like
the simple life, you know?

22
00:01:49,214 --> 00:01:51,705
Relax a little and raise a family.

23
00:01:51,783 --> 00:01:55,014
Settle down? Are you kidding?
I'm at the top of my game!

24
00:01:55,086 --> 00:01:57,680
I'm up there with the big dogs!
Girls, come on.

25
00:01:57,756 --> 00:02:01,157
Leave the saving of the world
to the men? I don't think so.

26
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,459
I don't think so.

27
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:23,170
<i>We interrupt for an important bulletin.</i>

28
00:02:23,238 --> 00:02:26,833
<i>A deadly high-speed pursuit between</i>
<i>police and armed gunmen is underway,</i>

29
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:29,342
<i>traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave.</i>

30
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:36,574
Yeah, I've got time.

31
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,203
Mr. Incredible.

32
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,182
- What is it, ma'am?
- My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.

33
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:17,755
Certainly. I suggest you stand clear.
There could be trouble.

34
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:19,384
No, he's quite tame.

35
00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:34,438
Let go now.

36
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:52,486
Thank you, Mr. Incredible.
You've done it again.

37
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,721
- You're the best.
- No, I'm just here to help.

38
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:57,287
<i>Attention all units.</i>
<i>We have a tour bus robbery...</i>

39
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:59,890
Tour bus robbery. I've still got time.

40
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:02,198
Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker.

41
00:04:02,704 --> 00:04:05,002
- Cool! Ready for take-off!
- What the...?

42
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:07,735
- Who are you supposed to be?
- I'm IncrediBoy.

43
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:09,333
What? No.

44
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,640
You're that kid from the fan club.

45
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:14,648
Brophy. Brody. Buddy! Buddy!

46
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:16,581
My name is IncrediBoy.

47
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:18,744
I've been nice, I've stood for photos,

48
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,414
signed every scrap of paper
you pushed at me...

49
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:24,117
No, don't worry about training me.
I know your moves,

50
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:27,161
crimefighting style,
favorite catchphrases, everything!

51
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:28,957
I'm your number one fan!

52
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,064
Hey! Hey, wait!

53
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:44,375
You know...

54
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:48,438
...you can tell a lot about a woman
by the contents of her purse,

55
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:51,280
but maybe that's not
what you had in mind.

56
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:52,649
Hey, look...

57
00:04:58,192 --> 00:04:59,454
Elastigirl.

58
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:01,586
Mr. Incredible.

59
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:05,330
- It's all right. I've got him.
- Sure, you've got him.

60
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,595
- I took him out for you.
- Sure, you did.

61
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:10,695
- His attention was on me.
- A fact I exploited to do my job.

62
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:13,036
- My job.
- A simple thank you will suffice.

63
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:15,268
Thanks, but I don't need any help.

64
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:17,402
Whatever happened to "ladies first"?

65
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:19,605
Whatever happened
to equal treatment?

66
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:22,275
Look, the lady got me first.

67
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,547
- Well, we could share, you know.
- I work alone.

68
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,111
Well, I think you need to be more...

69
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:30,249
...flexible.

70
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:32,657
Are you doing anything later?

71
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:35,127
I have a previous engagement.

72
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:48,602
Now, you just stay here.

73
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:51,577
They usually pick up
the garbage in an hour.

74
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:54,274
- Hey, Incredible!
- Hey, Frozone!

75
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:57,785
- Shouldn't you be getting ready?
- I still got time.

76
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:01,351
He's gonna jump!

77
00:06:15,603 --> 00:06:17,628
I think you broke something.

78
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:20,538
With counseling,
I think you'll come to forgive me.

79
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:22,405
Wait a minute.

80
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,508
Bomb Voyage.

81
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,399
Mr. Incredible...!

82
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:57,637
And IncrediBoy!

83
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,504
IncrediBoy?

84
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:05,518
Aren't you curious about how I get
around so fast? I have rocket boots.

85
00:07:05,586 --> 00:07:07,178
- Go home, Buddy. Now.
- What?

86
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:08,310
Little oaf...!

87
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:09,651
Can we talk?

88
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:11,851
You always say be true to yourself,

89
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:14,759
but you never say
which part to be true to.

90
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:19,630
Well, I've finally figured out who I am.
I am your ward... IncrediBoy!

91
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:22,761
And now, you have officially
carried it too far, Buddy.

92
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:25,305
This is because I don't have powers,
isn't it?

93
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:29,241
Not every superhero has powers,
you know. You can be super without them.

94
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,802
I invented these.
I can fly. Can you fly?

95
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,144
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

96
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:37,013
And your outfit is totally ridiculous!

97
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:40,384
Just give me one chance!
I'll show you. I'll go get the police.

98
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:42,946
- Buddy, don't!
- It'll only take a second.

99
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:44,889
No, stop!
There's a bomb!

100
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:49,128
Let go, you're wrecking
my flight pattern.

101
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:52,064
- I can do this if you let go!
- Will you just...?

102
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,363
- I'm trying to help! Stop!
- Let go of my cape!

103
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:43,240
Take this one home. And make sure
his mom knows what he's been doing.

104
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:45,217
I can help you. You're making a...

105
00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:47,379
The injured jumper.
You sent paramedics?

106
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:48,444
They picked him up.

107
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:51,287
The blast in that building
was caused by Bomb Voyage

108
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:52,917
who I caught robbing the vault.

109
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:55,224
We might nab him
if we set up a perimeter.

110
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:57,264
- He got away?
- Well, yeah.

111
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:59,856
- Skippy here made sure of that.
- IncrediBoy.

112
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:03,165
You're not affiliated with me!
Holy smokes, I'm late.

113
00:09:03,237 --> 00:09:05,432
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.

114
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:09,738
- What about Bomb Voyage?
- Any other night, I'd go after him,

115
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:13,907
but I really gotta go. Don't worry.
We'll get him! Eventually!

116
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,318
- Is the night still young?
- You're very late.

117
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,791
- How do I look? Good?
- The mask. You still got the mask.

118
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:30,194
Showtime.

119
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:37,604
Robert Parr, will you have this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

120
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:40,766
You're late. When you asked
if I was doing anything later,

121
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:44,175
I didn't realize you'd forgotten.
I thought it was playful banter.

122
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,645
- It was.
- Cutting it close, don't you think?

123
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:49,239
You need to be more... flexible.

124
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:51,717
I love you, but if we're
gonna make this work,

125
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:53,981
you've gotta be more
than Mr. Incredible.

126
00:09:54,055 --> 00:09:56,114
You know that. Don't you?

127
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,681
- ...so long as you both shall live?
- I do.

128
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,785
I pronounce this couple
husband and wife.

129
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:07,561
As long as we both shall live.
No matter what happens.

130
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:12,227
Hey, come on. We're superheroes.
What could happen?

131
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:18,333
<i>In a stunning turn of events,</i>
<i>a superhero is being sued</i>

132
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:20,670
<i>for saving someone</i>
<i>who didn't want to be saved.</i>

133
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,869
<i>The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,</i>

134
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:27,108
<i>who was foiled in his attempted</i>
<i>suicide by Mr. Incredible,</i>

135
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:31,209
<i>has filed suit against the famed</i>
<i>superhero in Superior Court.</i>

136
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:34,653
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

137
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:37,715
The injury received from
Mr. Incredible's "actions",

138
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:40,124
- causes him daily pain.
- I saved your life!

139
00:10:40,195 --> 00:10:42,595
You didn't save my life!
You ruined my death.

140
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:44,256
My client has no further comment.

141
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:48,666
<i>Five days later, another suit was filed</i>
<i>by the victims of the el train accident.</i>

142
00:10:48,737 --> 00:10:52,173
<i>Incredible's court losses</i>
<i>cost the government millions.</i>

143
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,609
<i>And opened the floodgates for dozens</i>
<i>of superhero lawsuits the world over.</i>

144
00:10:56,678 --> 00:11:01,638
It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

145
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:04,685
Time for them to join us, or go away.

146
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:07,688
<i>Under tremendous pressure,</i>
<i>and the crushing financial burden</i>

147
00:11:07,756 --> 00:11:10,224
<i>of an ever mounting series of lawsuits,</i>

148
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:14,193
<i>the government quietly initiated</i>
<i>the Superhero Relocation Program.</i>

149
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:17,891
<i>The supers were granted amnesty</i>
<i>from responsibility for past actions,</i>

150
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:22,335
<i>in exchange for the promise</i>
<i>to never again resume hero work.</i>

151
00:11:22,404 --> 00:11:24,099
<i>Where are they now?</i>

152
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:28,472
<i>They are living among us.</i>
<i>Average citizens, average heroes.</i>

153
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:33,845
<i>Quietly and anonymously continuing</i>
<i>to make the world a better place.</i>

154
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:37,810
Denied? You're denying my claim?

155
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,453
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

156
00:11:41,523 --> 00:11:42,956
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

157
00:11:43,024 --> 00:11:46,221
but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17.

158
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:49,195
- It states clearly...
- I can't pay for this.

159
00:11:49,264 --> 00:11:50,754
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

160
00:11:51,162 --> 00:11:53,756
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

161
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:56,129
We're now officially moved in.

162
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,997
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

163
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,435
The last three years
don't count because...

164
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:04,498
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official.

165
00:12:04,575 --> 00:12:07,635
<i>- Why do we have so much junk?</i>
- Listen, I've got a client.

166
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:10,738
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

167
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:13,215
I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

168
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:16,447
Bye, honey.
Excuse me. Where were we?

169
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:20,514
I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

170
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,889
I don't know what I'll do.

171
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:33,965
Listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

172
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:37,701
I'd like to say take a copy of
your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

173
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:43,077
Norma Wilcox. W-I-L-C-O-X.
On the third floor. But I can't.

174
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:46,810
I also do not advise you
to fill out and file a WS2475 form

175
00:12:46,884 --> 00:12:49,250
with our legal department
on the second floor.

176
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,949
I wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

177
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:55,515
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

178
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:59,222
- Oh, thank you, young man.
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I know you're upset!

179
00:12:59,297 --> 00:13:01,390
Pretend to be upset.

180
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:06,667
Parr!

181
00:13:06,738 --> 00:13:09,206
You authorized payment
on the Walker policy!

182
00:13:09,273 --> 00:13:11,537
Someone broke
into their house, Mr. Huph.

183
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:14,544
- Their policy covers...
- I don't wanna know about it.

184
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:18,446
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping Insuricare in the black.

185
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:21,076
Tell me how that's possible,
with you writing checks

186
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:25,179
to every Harry Hardluck and
Sally Sobstory that calls you.

187
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:30,350
<i>Morning break is over.</i>
<i>Morning break is over.</i>

188
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:36,967
I appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Parr.

189
00:13:37,702 --> 00:13:41,399
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

190
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:45,636
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

191
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,110
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you!

192
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:51,239
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

193
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:54,113
Well... not really. No.

194
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:55,311
Actually, not.

195
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:57,445
Oh, then how do you know it was him?

196
00:13:57,522 --> 00:14:00,082
I hid a camera.
Yeah, and this time, I've got him.

197
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:09,159
See? You see?

198
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,860
You don't see it?

199
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,168
He moves! Right there!

200
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:18,834
Wait, wait! Right there!

201
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,605
Right as I'm sitting down!

202
00:14:20,678 --> 00:14:22,441
I don't know how he does it,

203
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:24,811
but there's no tack before he moves

204
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:29,012
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

205
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:34,685
- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

206
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,852
This little rat is guilty!

207
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:41,388
You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

208
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:44,434
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

209
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:48,131
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty!

210
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:56,644
Dash, this is the third time this year
you've been sent to the office.

211
00:14:56,714 --> 00:15:01,242
We need to find a better outlet.
A more... constructive outlet.

212
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:04,311
Maybe I could,
if you'd let me go out for sports.

213
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,515
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

214
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:11,221
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

215
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:13,559
Dashiell Robert Parr,

216
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:16,794
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

217
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:18,995
The last thing you need is temptation.

218
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,471
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

219
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,770
Why can't I do the best that I can do?

220
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:29,973
Right now, the world wants us to fit in,
so we gotta be like everybody else.

221
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,743
Dad said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

222
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:36,753
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

223
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:39,449
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

224
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,464
Hey, Rydinger, where you headed?

225
00:15:53,838 --> 00:15:56,102
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

226
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:59,301
- Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?
- That's kind of funny.

227
00:16:00,011 --> 00:16:02,673
Hey, Tony, do you play football?

228
00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:07,682
Tony, I thought we were
gonna go swimming.

229
00:16:09,453 --> 00:16:11,421
He looked at me.

230
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:14,685
Come on, Violet!

231
00:16:38,683 --> 00:16:41,618
Darn kids. Sitting on the driveway...

232
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,047
Oh, great.

233
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:23,055
Mom.

234
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:27,824
- You're making weird faces again.
- No, I'm not.

235
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:30,332
You make weird faces, honey.

236
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:33,962
- Do you have to read at the table?
- Yeah.

237
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:36,939
Smaller bites, Dash.

238
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:39,909
Bob, could you help
the carnivore cut his meat?

239
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:45,475
Dash, you have something you
wanna tell your father about school?

240
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:49,349
- Well, we dissected a frog.
- Dash got sent to the office again.

241
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,980
- Good. Good.
- No, Bob, that's bad.

242
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:55,219
- What?
- Dash got sent to the office again.

243
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:57,157
- What?! What for?
- Nothing.

244
00:17:57,228 --> 00:18:00,163
He put a tack on the teacher's chair...
during class.

245
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:02,893
Nobody saw me.
You could barely see it on the tape.

246
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:06,164
They caught you on tape
and you still got away with it?

247
00:18:06,237 --> 00:18:08,728
You must have been booking.
How fast were you going?

248
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:10,398
We are not encouraging this.

249
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:12,567
I'm not, I'm just asking how fast...

250
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:14,110
Honey!

251
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:19,583
Great. First the car,
now I gotta pay to fix the table...

252
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,345
What happened to the car?

253
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:25,384
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

254
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,715
So, how about you, Vi?
How was school?

255
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:31,591
- Nothing to report.
- You've hardly touched your food.

256
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:35,325
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
- Well, it is leftover night.

257
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:38,368
We have steak, pasta...
What are you hungry for?

258
00:18:38,436 --> 00:18:41,166
- Tony Rydinger.
- Shut up.

259
00:18:41,238 --> 00:18:44,230
- Well, you are.
- I said, shut up, you little insect.

260
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:46,833
- Well, she is.
- Do not shout at the table.

261
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,312
- Honey!
- Kids! Listen to your mother.

262
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:54,074
She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf.

263
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:55,675
That's it!

264
00:18:55,753 --> 00:18:56,947
Stop it!

265
00:18:57,788 --> 00:19:01,519
- You're gonna be toast!
- Stop running in the house.

266
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:03,421
Sit down!

267
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:07,057
- Hey, no force fields!
- You started it.

268
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:09,725
You sit down! You sit down!

269
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,165
Violet!

270
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:20,070
Simon J. Paladino,

271
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:24,237
longtime advocate of superhero rights,
is missing?

272
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:26,142
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob! It's time to engage.

273
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:29,110
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob! It's time to engage.

274
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:31,545
Do something!
Don't just stand there!

275
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:34,209
- I need you to intervene!
- You want me to intervene?

276
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:36,479
Okay. I'm intervening!

277
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:40,251
Violet, let go of your brother.

278
00:19:40,323 --> 00:19:41,881
Hello?

279
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,488
Get the door.

280
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:48,657
- Hey, Lucius!
- Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack.

281
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:52,361
- Ice of you to drop by.
- Never heard that one before.

282
00:19:52,435 --> 00:19:54,164
Lucius!

283
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,804
- I like it when it shatters.
- I'll be back later.

284
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:05,404
- Where are you two going?
- It's Wednesday.

285
00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:08,713
Bowling night.
Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius.

286
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:11,481
Will do. Good night, Helen.
Good night, kids.

287
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:18,555
Don't think you've avoided
talking about the principal's office.

288
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:20,858
Your father and I
are still gonna discuss it.

289
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:23,866
I'm not the only kid who's
been sent to the office.

290
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:25,868
Other kids don't have superpowers.

291
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:29,463
- Now, it's perfectly normal...
- What do you know about normal?

292
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:32,235
What does anyone
in this family know about normal?

293
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,268
- Now, wait a minute, young lady.
- We act normal. I wanna be normal.

294
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:40,373
The only normal one is Jack-Jack,
and he's not even toilet trained.

295
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:43,514
Lucky.

296
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:46,078
I meant about being normal.

297
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:50,482
So now I'm in deep trouble.

298
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,654
I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and I'm an epitaph.

299
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,961
Somehow I managed to find cover.
What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

300
00:20:57,033 --> 00:21:00,025
- He starts monologuing.
- He starts monologuing.

301
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:04,005
He starts this prepared speech
about how feeble I am compared to him.

302
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:08,374
How inevitable my defeat is, the world
will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada.

303
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:09,878
- Yammering.
- Yammering.

304
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:13,109
I mean, the guy has me on a platter,
and he won't shut up.

305
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:16,778
<i>- Three Municiberg, we have a 23-56...</i>
- 23-56, what is that?

306
00:21:16,853 --> 00:21:19,117
- Robbery?
- This is just sad.

307
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:21,123
- Want to catch a robber?
- No.

308
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:23,716
Tell you the truth,
I'd rather go bowling.

309
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:28,287
Look, what if we actually did
what our wives think we're doing?

310
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:29,923
Just to shake things up.

311
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,664
He's not alone.
The fat guy's still with him.

312
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:37,104
They're just talking.

313
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:40,301
- What are we doing here?
- Protecting people.

314
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:42,675
- Nobody asked us.
- You need an invitation?

315
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:46,341
I'd like one, yes. We keep
sneaking out to do this, and...

316
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,908
- You remember Gazerbeam?
- There was something in the paper.

317
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:53,183
- He had trouble with civilian life.
- When did you see him?

318
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:56,817
I don't see anyone from the old days.
Just you.

319
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:59,123
- And we're pushing our luck as it is.
- Come on.

320
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:01,993
It was fun the first time,
but if we keep doing this...

321
00:22:02,065 --> 00:22:05,466
<i>- We have a report on a fire...</i>
- A fire. We're close!

322
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:08,470
- Yeah, baby!
- We're gonna get caught.

323
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:13,598
Fire! Yeah!

324
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:23,880
- Is that everybody?
- Yeah, that's everyone.

325
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:28,687
- It better be.
- Can't you put this out?

326
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:32,057
I can't lay down a layer thick enough!
It's evaporating too fast!

327
00:22:32,128 --> 00:22:34,255
- What's that mean?
- It means it's hot.

328
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:36,663
- I'm dehydrated, Bob.
- You're out of ice?

329
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:39,133
You can't run out.
You can use water in the air.

330
00:22:39,202 --> 00:22:43,002
There is no water in this air!
What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

331
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:46,008
I can't smash walls.
The building's getting weaker.

332
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:49,204
- It's gonna come down on top of us.
- I wanted to go bowling!

333
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:55,610
All right! Stay right on my tail!
This is gonna get hot!

334
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:16,363
Oh, good.

335
00:23:19,075 --> 00:23:20,064
That ain't right.

336
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:25,872
- We look like incompetent bad guys!
- You can get water out of the air.

337
00:23:25,949 --> 00:23:27,439
Freeze!

338
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:33,380
Freeze!

339
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:36,289
- I'm thirsty.
- I said freeze!

340
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:39,226
I'm just getting a drink.

341
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:48,230
- You've had your drink. Now...
- I know. I know. Freeze.

342
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:52,799
Police officers!

343
00:24:04,888 --> 00:24:06,617
That was way too close.

344
00:24:06,689 --> 00:24:09,385
We are not doing that again.

345
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:15,158
<i>Verify you want to switch targets? Over.</i>

346
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:18,792
Trust me. This is the one
he's been looking for.

347
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:48,027
- I thought you'd be back by 11.
- I said I'd be back later.

348
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:50,759
I assumed you'd be back later.
If you came back at all...

349
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:54,827
- ...you'd be "back later".
- Well, I'm back, okay?

350
00:25:01,478 --> 00:25:03,605
Is this rubble?

351
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,172
It was just a little workout.
Just to stay loose.

352
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,777
You know how I feel about that.
Darn you! We can't blow cover again.

353
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:13,948
- The building was coming down anyway.
- What?

354
00:25:14,023 --> 00:25:15,684
You knocked down a building?

355
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:18,659
It was on fire. Structurally unsound.
It was coming down.

356
00:25:18,728 --> 00:25:21,219
Have you been listening
to the police scanner again?

357
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:24,460
I performed a public service.
You act like that's bad.

358
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:25,967
It is a bad thing, Bob!

359
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:30,165
Uprooting our family again, so you can
relive the glory days is a bad thing.

360
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,175
It's better than acting like
they didn't happen!

361
00:25:33,243 --> 00:25:35,643
Yes! They happened!
But this, our family,

362
00:25:35,712 --> 00:25:39,341
is what's happening now, Bob.
You are missing this!

363
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:42,578
I can't believe you don't want to go to
your own son's graduation.

364
00:25:42,652 --> 00:25:46,213
It's not a graduation.
He's moving from fourth to fifth grade.

365
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:48,189
- It's a ceremony!
- It's psychotic!

366
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:50,988
They keep creating new ways
to celebrate mediocrity

367
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,994
but if someone is exceptional...

368
00:25:53,062 --> 00:25:55,326
This is not about you, Bob.
It's about Dash.

369
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:58,231
You want to do something for Dash?
Let him actually compete.

370
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:01,099
- Let him go out for sports!
- I will not be the enemy!

371
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:04,037
- You know why we can't.
- Because he'd be great.

372
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:06,132
This is not about you!

373
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:11,236
All right, Dash.
I know you're listening. Come on out.

374
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:13,612
Vi? You, too, young lady.

375
00:26:13,683 --> 00:26:16,049
Come on. Come on out.

376
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,816
It's okay, kids.
We're just having a discussion.

377
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:21,652
Pretty loud discussion.

378
00:26:21,724 --> 00:26:25,353
But that's okay. What's important
is that Mommy and I are a team.

379
00:26:25,428 --> 00:26:31,298
- We're united against the forces of...
- Pigheadedness?

380
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:33,927
- I was gonna say evil.
- We're sorry we woke you.

381
00:26:34,003 --> 00:26:36,335
Everything's okay.
Go back to bed. It's late.

382
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:38,533
- Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.
- Good night.

383
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:42,066
In fact, we should all be in bed.

384
00:26:55,124 --> 00:26:59,754
<i>Request claim</i>
<i>on claim numbers 158183...</i>

385
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:02,491
<i>Haven't you got him yet?</i>
<i>Where is he?</i>

386
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:05,159
<i>Mr. Huph would like to talk</i>
<i>to you in his office.</i>

387
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:07,327
- Now?
<i>- Now.</i>

388
00:27:25,822 --> 00:27:27,119
Sit down, Bob.

389
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:36,822
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

390
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:40,331
- Ask me why.
- Okay. Why?

391
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:42,371
Why what? Be specific, Bob.

392
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:44,099
Why are you unhappy?

393
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:46,004
Your customers make me unhappy.

394
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:47,804
What, you've gotten complaints?

395
00:27:47,877 --> 00:27:49,367
Complaints I can handle.

396
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:53,074
What I can't handle is your customers'
inexplicable knowledge

397
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:57,108
of Insuricare's inner workings!
They're experts. Experts, Bob!

398
00:27:57,186 --> 00:28:00,314
Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle!

399
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,858
They're penetrating the bureaucracy!

400
00:28:02,925 --> 00:28:05,655
- Did I do something illegal?
- No.

401
00:28:05,728 --> 00:28:10,062
- We shouldn't help our customers?
- The law requires that I answer no.

402
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:13,364
- We're supposed to help people.
- Help our people!

403
00:28:13,436 --> 00:28:15,301
Starting with our stockholders.

404
00:28:15,371 --> 00:28:17,771
Who's helping them out, huh?

405
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:24,040
You know, Bob, a company...

406
00:28:24,113 --> 00:28:25,740
Is like an enormous clock.

407
00:28:25,815 --> 00:28:29,842
...is like an enormous...
Yes. Precisely.

408
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,583
It only works if all
the little cogs mesh together.

409
00:28:34,657 --> 00:28:40,061
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight.

410
00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:45,829
The best clocks have jewel movements,
cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

411
00:28:45,902 --> 00:28:50,271
I'm being metaphorical, Bob.
Know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

412
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:52,034
Bob?

413
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:55,304
Bob? Look at me
when I'm talking to you, Parr.

414
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:58,472
- That man out there, he needs help.
- Don't change the subject.

415
00:28:58,548 --> 00:29:01,608
- We're discussing your attitude.
- He's getting mugged!

416
00:29:01,684 --> 00:29:04,175
- Let's hope we don't cover him.
- I'll be right back.

417
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:07,814
Stop right now or you're fired!

418
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:12,486
Close the door.

419
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,594
Get over here, now.

420
00:29:20,303 --> 00:29:23,898
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

421
00:29:24,974 --> 00:29:28,808
- He got away.
- Good thing, too.

422
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:31,506
You were this close to losing your...

423
00:29:43,426 --> 00:29:47,055
<i>Please report to</i>
<i>operating room 722 immediately.</i>

424
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:55,436
- How is he?
- He'll live.

425
00:29:55,505 --> 00:29:57,166
- I'm fired, aren't I?
- You think?

426
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,004
- What can I say, Rick?
- Nothing you haven't said before.

427
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:02,067
- Someone was in trouble.
- Always.

428
00:30:02,145 --> 00:30:04,773
- I had to do something.
- Every time you say that,

429
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:07,008
it's a month and a half
of trouble for me.

430
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:09,415
Hundreds of thousands
of taxpayer's dollars.

431
00:30:09,485 --> 00:30:12,079
- I know.
- We pay to keep the company quiet.

432
00:30:12,155 --> 00:30:15,283
We pay damages, erase memories,
relocate your family.

433
00:30:15,358 --> 00:30:17,918
Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money.

434
00:30:17,994 --> 00:30:22,021
We can't keep doing this. We appreciate
what you did in the old days,

435
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:25,431
but those days are over.
From now on, you're on your own.

436
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:33,166
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you,
you know, for old times' sake.

437
00:30:33,242 --> 00:30:36,370
I can't do that to my family.
Everyone just got settled.

438
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:38,675
I'll make it work. Thanks.

439
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:40,739
Take care of yourself.

440
00:30:52,962 --> 00:30:55,157
What are you waiting for?

441
00:30:55,231 --> 00:30:59,258
I don't know.
Something amazing, I guess.

442
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:02,230
Me too, kid.

443
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:40,707
"Hold still"?

- The...
- What?

478
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,938
The company is sending me

00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:33,504
- A conference?
- Out of town.

480
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:35,106
I'm gonna be gone for a few days.

481
00:34:35,184 --> 00:34:39,348
They've never sent you to a conference
before. This is good, isn't it?

482
00:34:39,422 --> 00:34:40,411
Yes.

is a top secret prototype battle robot.

490
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:09,743
Its artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem

491
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:12,720
it's confronted with.
And, unfortunately...

492
00:35:12,788 --> 00:35:16,383
Let me guess. It got smart enough
to wonder why it had to take orders.

493
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:20,088
We lost control. Now it's loose
in the jungle, threatening our facility.

494
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:23,723
We've had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety.

495
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:24,788
How am I going in?

496
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:28,803
The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate
an air drop from 5000 feet.

497
00:35:28,871 --> 00:35:32,398
Its cloaking devices
make it difficult to track.

498
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:35,774
We're pretty sure it's on
the southern half of the island.

499
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:39,611
One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.

500
00:35:39,682 --> 00:35:42,014
You want me to shut it down
without destroying it.

501
00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:44,609
You are Mr. Incredible.

502
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:06,406
I've got to warn you,
it's a learning robot.

503
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:10,104
Every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you.

504
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:12,443
Shut it down. Do it quickly.
Don't destroy it.

505
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:16,076
- And don't die.
- Great. Thanks.

506
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:47,644
Showtime.

507
00:38:55,277 --> 00:38:56,801
My back!

508
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:08,444
Surprising. We must bring him back.

509
00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:12,351
Sound the all clear,
and invite him to dinner.

510
00:40:31,707 --> 00:40:33,971
Most important, keep things light.

511
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:37,944
Praise him. Make him feel
like we appreciate his abilities.

512
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:40,609
Am I overdressed?

513
00:40:40,682 --> 00:40:43,276
Actually, you look rather dashing.

514
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:46,381
- I take it our host is...
- I'm sorry.

515
00:40:46,455 --> 00:40:49,788
He won't be dining with us.
He hopes you'll understand.

516
00:40:49,858 --> 00:40:53,453
Of course. I do usually make it a point
to know who I'm working for.

517
00:40:53,529 --> 00:40:56,430
He prefers a certain amount
of anonymity.

518
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:59,058
Surely, you of all people
understand that.

519
00:40:59,134 --> 00:41:03,833
I was just wondering, of all the places
to settle down, why live...

520
00:41:03,906 --> 00:41:08,206
With a volcano? He's attracted to power.
So am I.

521
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:12,077
- It's a weakness we share.
- Seems a bit unstable.

522
00:41:12,147 --> 00:41:15,344
I prefer to think of it
as misunderstood.

523
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:17,009
Aren't we all?

524
00:41:17,085 --> 00:41:19,815
Volcanic soil is among
the most fertile on Earth.

525
00:41:19,888 --> 00:41:23,016
Everything at the table
was grown right here.

526
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:27,357
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

527
00:42:50,245 --> 00:42:52,543
- Jeez.
- Hurry, honey.

528
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:54,673
Or you'll be late for work.

529
00:42:56,218 --> 00:42:58,277
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

530
00:42:58,353 --> 00:43:01,254
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

531
00:43:01,323 --> 00:43:02,881
All that jazz.

532
00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:12,398
<i>You have an appointment?</i>

533
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:14,697
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

534
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:18,228
<i>- All visitors are required...</i>
<i>- Go check the electric fence.</i>

535
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:20,400
<i>What is it? Who are you?</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>

536
00:43:21,743 --> 00:43:25,679
<i>My God, you've gotten fat. Come in.</i>
<i>Come, come.</i>

537
00:43:32,888 --> 00:43:37,621
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

538
00:43:37,693 --> 00:43:42,096
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

539
00:43:42,164 --> 00:43:44,962
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prague?

540
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:47,126
Milan, darling. Milan.

541
00:43:47,202 --> 00:43:51,161
Supermodels. Nothing super about them.

542
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:53,673
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

543
00:43:53,742 --> 00:43:56,302
with poofy lips who think only
about themselves.

544
00:43:56,878 --> 00:44:00,245
I used to design for gods.

545
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:06,185
But perhaps you come with a challenge?
I was surprised to get your call.

546
00:44:06,254 --> 00:44:09,121
E, I just need a patch job.

547
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:12,422
This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

548
00:44:12,494 --> 00:44:16,828
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, Robert?

549
00:44:16,898 --> 00:44:19,264
Moonlighting hero work?

550
00:44:19,334 --> 00:44:21,359
Must have happened a long time ago.

551
00:44:21,436 --> 00:44:24,564
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

552
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,370
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

553
00:44:27,442 --> 00:44:31,469
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

554
00:44:31,546 --> 00:44:34,709
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

555
00:44:34,783 --> 00:44:37,479
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

556
00:44:37,552 --> 00:44:40,043
Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

557
00:44:40,122 --> 00:44:42,590
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

558
00:44:42,658 --> 00:44:44,853
So ask me now,
before I again become sane.

559
00:44:44,926 --> 00:44:47,827
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

560
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:51,229
You push too hard, darling!
But I accept.

561
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,396
- It will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

562
00:44:54,469 --> 00:44:59,736
- Heroic!
- Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy!

563
00:44:59,808 --> 00:45:03,107
He had a great look!
Oh, the cape and the boots...

564
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:04,202
No capes!

565
00:45:05,647 --> 00:45:09,413
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

566
00:45:09,484 --> 00:45:12,317
<i>Tall, storm powers. Nice man.</i>
<i>Good with kids.</i>

567
00:45:12,387 --> 00:45:15,254
- Listen, E...
- November 15th of '58.

568
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:22,060
<i>All was well, another day saved</i>
<i>when his cape snagged on a missile fin.</i>

569
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,462
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

570
00:45:24,533 --> 00:45:25,557
Stratogale!

571
00:45:25,634 --> 00:45:30,936
<i>April 23rd, '57.</i>
<i>Cape caught in a jet turbine.</i>

572
00:45:31,006 --> 00:45:33,270
You can't generalize
about these things.

573
00:45:33,341 --> 00:45:36,674
<i>Meta-Man. Express elevator.</i>
<i>Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.</i>

574
00:45:36,745 --> 00:45:39,908
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes!

575
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:44,077
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

576
00:45:44,152 --> 00:45:46,177
You know I'm retired from hero work.

577
00:45:46,254 --> 00:45:50,054
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

578
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:53,959
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

579
00:45:54,796 --> 00:45:58,129
Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit.

580
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,694
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

581
00:46:15,717 --> 00:46:18,083
Don't answer it, honey, I got it!

582
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:20,986
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

583
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,893
<i>- How soon can you get here?</i>
<i>- I'll leave tomorrow morning.</i>

584
00:46:27,963 --> 00:46:29,692
<i>- See you there.</i>
- Goodbye.

585
00:46:32,534 --> 00:46:35,298
Who was that, honey? The office?

586
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:38,237
Another conference.
Short notice, but you know...

587
00:46:38,306 --> 00:46:40,137
...duty calls.

588
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:50,110
- Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

589
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,684
- Have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

590
00:46:54,756 --> 00:46:57,190
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

591
00:46:57,259 --> 00:47:01,593
- So much.
- I love you too.

592
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:16,776
<i>This is your automated Captain.</i>

593
00:47:16,845 --> 00:47:20,076
<i>Would you care for more mimosa?</i>

594
00:47:20,148 --> 00:47:23,311
- Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

595
00:47:24,753 --> 00:47:29,417
<i>Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.</i>
<i>Perfect weather for flying.</i>

596
00:47:35,463 --> 00:47:39,194
<i>Please fasten your seat belt.</i>
<i>We're beginning our descent.</i>

597
00:48:03,825 --> 00:48:08,125
- Hello, Mr. Incredible. Nice suit.
- Thanks.

598
00:48:08,196 --> 00:48:11,654
Nice to be back, Mirage.

599
00:48:37,025 --> 00:48:40,722
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at two.

600
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:44,231
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

601
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:45,926
See you there.

602
00:49:18,466 --> 00:49:20,058
Edna.

603
00:49:20,135 --> 00:49:22,899
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
<i>- This is Edna.</i>

604
00:49:22,971 --> 00:49:25,701
- E? This is Helen.
<i>- Helen who?</i>

605
00:49:25,774 --> 00:49:29,039
Helen Parr? You know...

606
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:31,000
Elastigirl?

607
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,311
<i>Darling! It's been such a long time</i>
<i>after all these years! So long!</i>

608
00:49:35,383 --> 00:49:37,044
Yes, it's been a while. Listen.

609
00:49:37,118 --> 00:49:40,781
There's only one person Bob would trust
to patch his supersuit. That's you.

610
00:49:40,855 --> 00:49:42,948
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

611
00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:45,788
Much better than those horrible pajamas
he used to wear.

612
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,727
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

613
00:49:48,797 --> 00:49:51,061
<i>- I'm calling about...</i>
- Don't make me beg.

614
00:49:51,132 --> 00:49:55,034
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg, no, I'm calling about suit.

615
00:49:55,103 --> 00:49:58,004
About Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

616
00:49:58,073 --> 00:50:01,907
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

617
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:34,903
It's bigger!

618
00:50:36,244 --> 00:50:37,734
It's badder!

619
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,147
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

620
00:50:46,388 --> 00:50:48,948
It's finally ready.

621
00:50:49,024 --> 00:50:53,051
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

622
00:50:53,128 --> 00:50:56,188
but man, it wasn't good enough!

623
00:50:56,264 --> 00:51:00,325
After you trashed the last one,
I had to make some major modifications.

624
00:51:00,402 --> 00:51:03,667
Sure it was difficult,
but you are worth it.

625
00:51:03,738 --> 00:51:07,902
I mean, after all,
I am your biggest fan.

626
00:51:08,977 --> 00:51:12,538
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

627
00:51:12,714 --> 00:51:14,841
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

628
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:18,545
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

629
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:22,215
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

630
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,918
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

631
00:51:24,993 --> 00:51:28,520
It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

632
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:30,860
You can't count on anyone.

633
00:51:30,932 --> 00:51:32,866
Especially your heroes.

634
00:51:32,934 --> 00:51:36,028
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

635
00:51:36,104 --> 00:51:39,437
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

636
00:51:39,507 --> 00:51:41,134
That's the way it works.

637
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:43,939
There's a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect.

638
00:51:44,012 --> 00:51:46,845
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

639
00:51:46,915 --> 00:51:49,611
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

640
00:51:49,684 --> 00:51:53,882
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

641
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:58,523
You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

642
00:51:58,593 --> 00:52:00,561
I can't believe it.

643
00:52:01,629 --> 00:52:05,087
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.

644
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:08,260
I save the best inventions for myself.

645
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:10,099
Am I good enough now?

646
00:52:11,573 --> 00:52:13,165
Who's super now?

647
00:52:13,241 --> 00:52:16,176
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

648
00:52:17,145 --> 00:52:18,806
Oh, brilliant!

649
00:52:36,931 --> 00:52:39,365
All right, try this one on
for size, big boy.

650
00:53:14,269 --> 00:53:16,829
Gazerbeam.

651
00:53:28,249 --> 00:53:30,114
"Kronos?"

652
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:59,741
<i>Life reading negative.</i>
<i>Mr. Incredible terminated.</i>

653
00:54:03,284 --> 00:54:07,914
This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

654
00:54:07,989 --> 00:54:12,255
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

655
00:54:12,327 --> 00:54:16,229
Simple, elegant, yet bold.
You will die.

656
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:18,390
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

657
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:22,061
and it turned out so beautiful,
I had to continue.

658
00:54:22,136 --> 00:54:26,095
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

659
00:54:26,174 --> 00:54:28,972
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

660
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,401
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

661
00:54:31,479 --> 00:54:33,572
That is why I show you my work.

662
00:54:33,648 --> 00:54:35,445
That is why you are here.

663
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:44,220
Edna Mode.

664
00:54:45,126 --> 00:54:46,650
And guest.

665
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:05,406
Come. Sit.

666
00:55:09,384 --> 00:55:12,581
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

667
00:55:12,654 --> 00:55:15,316
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

668
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:19,383
Darling! I cut it a little roomy
for the free movement.

669
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,554
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

670
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:27,333
and can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees.

671
00:55:29,237 --> 00:55:31,467
Completely bulletproof.

672
00:55:33,675 --> 00:55:36,337
And machine washable.
That's a new feature.

673
00:55:36,411 --> 00:55:39,278
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

674
00:55:39,347 --> 00:55:43,681
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

675
00:55:43,751 --> 00:55:47,016
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

676
00:55:47,088 --> 00:55:49,420
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

677
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,549
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

678
00:55:53,161 --> 00:55:57,222
Your boy's suit I designed
to withstand enormous friction

679
00:55:57,298 --> 00:56:01,632
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

680
00:56:01,703 --> 00:56:04,263
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

681
00:56:04,339 --> 00:56:09,902
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

682
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:17,609
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

683
00:56:17,685 --> 00:56:20,620
and still retain its shape.

684
00:56:20,688 --> 00:56:22,918
Virtually indestructible...

685
00:56:24,158 --> 00:56:26,888
...yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

686
00:56:26,961 --> 00:56:30,419
As an extra feature, each suit contains
a homing device,

687
00:56:30,498 --> 00:56:34,764
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

688
00:56:35,636 --> 00:56:38,503
Well, darling? What do you think?

689
00:56:38,573 --> 00:56:43,510
What do I think?
Bob is retired! I'm retired!

690
00:56:43,578 --> 00:56:45,273
Our family is underground.

691
00:56:45,346 --> 00:56:48,747
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

692
00:56:48,816 --> 00:56:51,011
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

693
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:53,986
Why would he keep secrets from you?

694
00:56:54,055 --> 00:56:57,047
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

695
00:56:57,125 --> 00:57:00,720
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

696
00:57:00,795 --> 00:57:03,127
Prone to weakness.

697
00:57:03,197 --> 00:57:06,598
- What are you saying?
- Do you know where he is?

698
00:57:06,667 --> 00:57:10,467
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

699
00:58:41,481 --> 00:58:44,882
- Hey, hey. We got a man down!
- Come on, let's go.

700
00:58:48,621 --> 00:58:51,021
Are you okay? What happened?

701
00:58:53,193 --> 00:58:56,424
<i>Break surveillance and engage. Over.</i>
<i>Continuing sweep...</i>

702
01:00:37,797 --> 01:00:40,857
<i>- Insuricare.</i>
- Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr.

703
01:00:40,934 --> 01:00:44,028
Bob Parr is my husband.
I was wondering if you could give me

704
01:00:44,103 --> 01:00:48,267
the number of the hotel he's staying at?
The number I have is no good.

705
01:00:48,341 --> 01:00:51,208
<i>- Mr. Parr no longer works here.</i>
- What do you mean?

706
01:00:51,277 --> 01:00:53,871
He's on a business trip.
A company retreat.

707
01:00:53,947 --> 01:00:56,882
<i>My records say he was terminated</i>
<i>almost two months ago.</i>

708
01:01:27,614 --> 01:01:30,777
So, you don't know where he is.

709
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:36,119
Would you like to find out?

710
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:55,655
I am such an idiot.

711
01:02:55,728 --> 01:02:58,060
I let this happen, you know.

712
01:02:58,131 --> 01:03:02,124
The new sports car, the getting
in shape, the blond hair, the lies.

713
01:03:02,201 --> 01:03:05,364
Yes, he attempts to relive the past.

714
01:03:05,438 --> 01:03:09,272
Now I'm losing him! What'll I do?
What'll I do?

715
01:03:09,342 --> 01:03:12,106
What are you talking about?

716
01:03:13,379 --> 01:03:17,611
You are Elastigirl! My God!
Pull yourself together.

717
01:03:17,683 --> 01:03:19,776
What will you do?
Is this a question?

718
01:03:19,852 --> 01:03:22,412
Show him you remember
that he is Mr. Incredible,

719
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:25,423
and you will remind him who you are!

720
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:29,655
Well, you know where he is.
Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win!

721
01:03:30,129 --> 01:03:33,963
And call me when you get back, darling.
I enjoy our visits.

722
01:03:34,033 --> 01:03:36,627
There's lots of leftovers
that you can reheat.

723
01:03:36,702 --> 01:03:40,729
Make sure Dash does his homework.
And both of you, get to bed on time.

724
01:03:40,807 --> 01:03:42,672
I should be back tonight. Late.

725
01:03:42,742 --> 01:03:44,835
You can be in charge that long,
can't you?

726
01:03:44,911 --> 01:03:47,641
Yeah. But why am I in charge again?

727
01:03:47,713 --> 01:03:50,181
Nothing.
Just a little trouble with Daddy.

728
01:03:50,249 --> 01:03:54,652
You mean Dad's in trouble,
or Dad is the trouble?

729
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,622
I mean either he's in trouble,
or he's going to be.

730
01:04:04,797 --> 01:04:07,425
What's that?
Where'd you get that, Mom?

731
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,730
You made a cool outfit?
Hey, are those for us?

732
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:11,326
We all get cool outfits?

733
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:15,069
Dash! You come back here this moment!

734
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:18,942
Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back.

735
01:04:19,011 --> 01:04:22,572
I know this is short notice,
but I was hoping that I could...

736
01:04:22,648 --> 01:04:25,617
What are these?
Look, I'm The Dash!

737
01:04:25,685 --> 01:04:28,449
- The Dash likes.
- Just a second.

738
01:04:28,521 --> 01:04:32,355
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

739
01:04:32,425 --> 01:04:35,417
- Are you hiding something?
- Please. I'm on the phone...

740
01:04:35,495 --> 01:04:37,656
- Dash!
- This is yours. It's specially made.

741
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:41,097
- What's going on?
- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

742
01:04:43,269 --> 01:04:45,260
What makes you think it's special?

743
01:04:45,338 --> 01:04:48,273
I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it?

744
01:04:56,749 --> 01:05:00,207
Snug, I'm calling
in a solid you owe me.

745
01:05:00,286 --> 01:05:03,778
<i>- What do you need?</i>
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?

746
01:05:03,856 --> 01:05:06,347
<i>Let me think.</i>

747
01:05:14,634 --> 01:05:17,569
Island approach.
India Golf niner-niner checking in.

748
01:05:17,637 --> 01:05:20,197
VFR on top. Over.

749
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:25,200
Island tower,
this is India Golf niner-niner

750
01:05:25,278 --> 01:05:28,304
requesting vectors to the initial. Over.

751
01:05:38,257 --> 01:05:40,851
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

752
01:05:40,927 --> 01:05:45,523
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

753
01:05:46,265 --> 01:05:50,668
At the same time. Yeah.

754
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:07,351
You sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible".

755
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,251
I was right to idolize you.

756
01:06:09,322 --> 01:06:11,950
I always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe

757
01:06:12,024 --> 01:06:15,858
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man!

758
01:06:15,928 --> 01:06:18,453
I'm still geeking out about it!

759
01:06:19,899 --> 01:06:23,300
And then you had
to just go and ruin the ride.

760
01:06:23,369 --> 01:06:28,363
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help?
"Help me, help me."

761
01:06:28,441 --> 01:06:30,841
Lame, lame, lame.

762
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:35,609
- All right, who did you contact?
- Contact? What are you talking about?

763
01:06:40,286 --> 01:06:43,119
I am referring to last night
at 2307 hours

764
01:06:43,189 --> 01:06:46,215
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.

765
01:06:46,292 --> 01:06:49,489
I didn't know about the homing device.

766
01:06:53,966 --> 01:06:58,335
And now a government plane is
requesting permission to land here.

767
01:06:58,404 --> 01:07:01,430
- Who did you contact?
- I didn't send for a plane.

768
01:07:01,507 --> 01:07:03,441
Play the transmission.

769
01:07:04,343 --> 01:07:08,143
<i>- India golf niner-niner checking in.</i>
- Helen!

770
01:07:08,214 --> 01:07:11,411
So you do know these people.

771
01:07:11,484 --> 01:07:14,351
Well, then, I'll send them
a little greeting.

772
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:20,254
- Violet!
- It's not my fault.

773
01:07:20,326 --> 01:07:22,692
Dash ran away,
I knew I'd get blamed for it.

774
01:07:22,762 --> 01:07:24,320
That's not true!

775
01:07:24,397 --> 01:07:27,366
You said, "Something's up with Mom.
We have to find out what.

776
01:07:27,433 --> 01:07:31,028
- ...and it's not my fault!
- Hundred percent all-yours idea!

777
01:07:31,103 --> 01:07:34,004
Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?

778
01:07:34,073 --> 01:07:36,974
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.

779
01:07:37,043 --> 01:07:39,409
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!

780
01:07:39,478 --> 01:07:42,504
All right, well, who'd you get?

781
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:45,049
You don't have to worry
about one thing.

782
01:07:45,117 --> 01:07:48,518
I've got babysitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned CPR,

783
01:07:48,587 --> 01:07:51,818
- excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.

784
01:07:51,891 --> 01:07:54,155
I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps

785
01:07:54,226 --> 01:07:57,161
because leading experts say
Mozart makes babies smarter.

786
01:07:57,229 --> 01:07:58,321
Kari...

787
01:07:58,397 --> 01:08:01,298
The beauty is they don't have to listen
'cause they're asleep!

788
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:03,335
I wish my parents played Mozart

789
01:08:03,402 --> 01:08:06,496
because half the time I don't know
what anyone's talking about.

790
01:08:06,572 --> 01:08:10,064
Kari, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.

791
01:08:10,142 --> 01:08:13,202
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but I'd rather call a service.

792
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:15,213
There's really no need, Mrs. Parr.

793
01:08:15,281 --> 01:08:17,977
I can totally handle anything
this baby can dish out.

794
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:20,712
Can't I, little baby? I can handle it.

795
01:08:20,786 --> 01:08:22,378
<i>Who can handle it?</i>

796
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:33,264
India Golf niner-niner transmitting
in the blind guard.

797
01:08:33,332 --> 01:08:35,232
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

798
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:07,427
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

799
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,695
<i>- Friendlies...</i>
- No! Call off the missiles.

800
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:13,637
- I'll do anything.
- Too late. Fifteen years too late.

801
01:09:15,307 --> 01:09:18,276
Friendlies two-zero miles
south-southwest of your position.

802
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:20,938
Angels ten. Track east. Disengage.

803
01:09:21,013 --> 01:09:23,607
Vi! Put a force field around the plane.

804
01:09:23,682 --> 01:09:25,377
You said not to use our powers.

805
01:09:25,451 --> 01:09:27,783
I know what I said.
Listen to what I'm saying now!

806
01:09:27,853 --> 01:09:30,117
Disengage. Repeat, disengage!

807
01:09:34,794 --> 01:09:37,456
- Mom?
- Violet!

808
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:40,693
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner
is buddy-spiked. Abort!

809
01:09:40,766 --> 01:09:42,165
There are children aboard.

810
01:09:42,234 --> 01:09:44,600
<i>- There are children aboard!</i>
- No!

811
01:09:46,305 --> 01:09:49,274
- Put a field around us now!
- I've never done one that big.

812
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:50,433
Do it now!

813
01:09:51,977 --> 01:09:53,171
Abort, abort, abort!

814
01:09:55,581 --> 01:09:57,105
Abort, abort, abort!

815
01:10:28,347 --> 01:10:30,212
Brace yourselves!

816
01:10:36,422 --> 01:10:39,482
- Mom!
- Everybody calm down.

817
01:10:39,558 --> 01:10:41,549
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

818
01:10:41,627 --> 01:10:44,095
We're not gonna panic,
we're not... Look out!

819
01:10:55,474 --> 01:10:58,136
- Oh, my God! Who's idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

820
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:00,405
We're dead! We're dead!

821
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:03,175
- It blew up!
- We survived but we're dead!

822
01:11:03,249 --> 01:11:04,841
Stop it!

823
01:11:05,618 --> 01:11:07,586
We are not gonna die!

824
01:11:07,653 --> 01:11:09,484
Both of you will get a grip.

825
01:11:09,555 --> 01:11:11,989
Or so help me
I will ground you for a month!

826
01:11:12,057 --> 01:11:13,888
Understand?

827
01:11:14,493 --> 01:11:18,361
We have a confirmed hit.
Target was destroyed.

828
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:20,455
You'll get over it.

829
01:11:20,533 --> 01:11:24,264
I seem to recall
you prefer to "work alone".

830
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:36,513
Release me. Now!

831
01:11:36,582 --> 01:11:39,676
- Or what?
- I'll crush her.

832
01:11:39,752 --> 01:11:42,448
That sounds a little dark for you.
Well, go ahead.

833
01:11:42,521 --> 01:11:45,456
It'll be easy.
Like breaking a toothpick.

834
01:11:45,524 --> 01:11:47,321
Show me.

835
01:11:59,772 --> 01:12:01,967
I knew you couldn't do it.

836
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:05,238
Even when you have nothing to lose.

837
01:12:05,311 --> 01:12:06,972
You're weak.

838
01:12:07,046 --> 01:12:09,207
And I've outgrown you.

839
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:23,224
Those were short-range missiles.
Land-based.

840
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,990
That way is our best bet.

841
01:12:25,064 --> 01:12:27,897
You want to go toward
the people that tried to kill us?

842
01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:32,063
- If it means land, yes.
- Do you expect us to swim there?

843
01:12:32,137 --> 01:12:35,470
I expect you to trust me.

844
01:13:36,235 --> 01:13:38,328
What a trooper.

845
01:13:38,404 --> 01:13:40,531
I'm so proud of you.

846
01:13:40,606 --> 01:13:42,699
Thanks, Mom.

847
01:13:48,414 --> 01:13:51,406
I think your father is in trouble.

848
01:13:51,483 --> 01:13:54,316
If you haven't noticed,
we're not doing so hot either.

849
01:13:54,386 --> 01:13:55,717
I'm going to look for him.

850
01:13:55,788 --> 01:13:58,552
And that means you're in charge
until I get back, Violet.

851
01:13:58,624 --> 01:14:00,854
- What?
- You heard her.

852
01:14:03,295 --> 01:14:06,822
Put these on. Your identity
is your most valuable possession.

853
01:14:06,899 --> 01:14:07,888
Protect it.

854
01:14:07,966 --> 01:14:10,901
And if anything goes wrong,
use your powers.

855
01:14:10,969 --> 01:14:13,631
- But you said never to use...
- I know what I said!

856
01:14:16,909 --> 01:14:21,437
Remember the bad guys on those shows
you used to watch on Saturday mornings?

857
01:14:21,513 --> 01:14:24,914
Well, these guys
are not like those guys.

858
01:14:24,983 --> 01:14:28,510
They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.

859
01:14:28,587 --> 01:14:31,784
They will kill you
if they get the chance.

860
01:14:31,857 --> 01:14:34,087
Do not give them that chance.

861
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:36,320
- Mom?
- Vi, I'm counting on you.

862
01:14:36,395 --> 01:14:38,920
- There's...
- I'm counting on you. Be strong.

863
01:14:40,299 --> 01:14:44,633
Dash, if anything goes wrong,
I want you to run as fast as you can.

864
01:14:44,703 --> 01:14:47,331
- As fast as I can?
- As fast as you can.

865
01:14:47,406 --> 01:14:51,809
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe.
I'll be back by morning.

866
01:14:55,147 --> 01:14:56,774
Mom!

867
01:14:57,516 --> 01:15:00,542
Mom, what happened on the plane.
I'm sorry.

868
01:15:00,619 --> 01:15:03,918
I wanted to help. When you
asked me to... I'm sorry.

869
01:15:03,989 --> 01:15:05,854
It isn't your fault.

870
01:15:05,924 --> 01:15:09,792
It wasn't fair for me to suddenly
ask so much of you.

871
01:15:09,862 --> 01:15:12,228
But things are different now.

872
01:15:12,297 --> 01:15:15,323
And doubt is a luxury
we can't afford anymore, sweetie.

873
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,891
You have more power than you realize.

874
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:20,495
Don't think. And don't worry.

875
01:15:20,572 --> 01:15:23,132
If the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

876
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:25,699
It's in your blood.

877
01:16:02,815 --> 01:16:05,443
He's not weak, you know.

878
01:16:05,517 --> 01:16:06,506
What?

879
01:16:06,585 --> 01:16:08,883
Valuing life is not weakness.

880
01:16:08,954 --> 01:16:12,685
Look, if you're talking about
what happened in the containment unit,

881
01:16:12,758 --> 01:16:14,658
I had everything under control.

882
01:16:14,726 --> 01:16:17,456
And disregarding it is not strength.

883
01:16:17,529 --> 01:16:20,362
I called his bluff, sweetheart,
that's all.

884
01:16:20,432 --> 01:16:22,832
I knew he wouldn't have it in him
to actually...

885
01:16:22,901 --> 01:16:25,961
Next time you gamble,
bet your own life!

886
01:17:37,276 --> 01:17:39,244
A rocket?

887
01:18:34,032 --> 01:18:35,021
Hey!

888
01:19:32,457 --> 01:19:37,417
Well, not that this isn't fun,
but I'm gonna go look around.

889
01:19:37,496 --> 01:19:41,364
What do you think is going on here?
You think we're on vacation?

890
01:19:41,433 --> 01:19:44,402
Mom and Dad's lives
could be in jeopardy.

891
01:19:44,469 --> 01:19:46,869
Or worse, their marriage.

892
01:19:46,938 --> 01:19:48,929
Their marriage?

893
01:19:49,007 --> 01:19:53,569
So, the bad guys are trying to wreck
Mom and Dad's marriage.

894
01:19:53,645 --> 01:19:55,909
Forget it. You're so immature.

895
01:19:55,981 --> 01:19:59,041
- I'm gonna go look around.
- Mom said to stay hidden.

896
01:19:59,117 --> 01:20:02,018
I'm not gonna leave the cave.

897
01:20:41,426 --> 01:20:43,326
Cool!

898
01:20:43,595 --> 01:20:45,358
Cool!

899
01:20:46,898 --> 01:20:49,332
<i>Roger. We are ready for launch.</i>

900
01:20:59,344 --> 01:21:03,144
- Vi, Vi!
- What did you do?

901
01:21:15,794 --> 01:21:18,786
<i>ETA two-niner. Over.</i>

902
01:21:20,899 --> 01:21:24,426
<i>TCI clear. Condition yellow.</i>
<i>Status norm.</i>

903
01:21:26,571 --> 01:21:28,334
<i>Not responding to IFF.</i>

904
01:21:28,406 --> 01:21:30,704
<i>IRCM reads negative.</i>

905
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:33,605
- Bob.
- What?

906
01:21:33,678 --> 01:21:35,009
I didn't say anything.

907
01:22:03,842 --> 01:22:06,174
<i>Identification, please.</i>

908
01:22:06,611 --> 01:22:09,512
- Hey! Hey, Violet! Come here, look.
- What?

909
01:22:09,581 --> 01:22:10,775
- It talks!
- What?

910
01:22:10,849 --> 01:22:12,180
There. That one.

911
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:13,842
<i>Voice key incorrect.</i>

912
01:22:14,452 --> 01:22:18,548
- "Voice key"?
<i>- Voice key incorrect.</i>

913
01:22:18,623 --> 01:22:20,284
Wait a second.

914
01:22:22,127 --> 01:22:23,924
- What do we do?
- Run!

915
01:22:23,995 --> 01:22:26,122
- Where are we going?
- Away from here!

916
01:22:31,002 --> 01:22:33,493
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

917
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:59,091
- There isn't much time.
- No, there isn't.

918
01:22:59,164 --> 01:23:01,428
In fact, there's no time at all.

919
01:23:01,499 --> 01:23:03,626
- Please...
- Why are you here?

920
01:23:03,702 --> 01:23:08,696
How can you possibly bring me lower?
What more can you take away from me?

921
01:23:08,773 --> 01:23:12,573
Family survived the crash.

922
01:23:12,644 --> 01:23:15,772
- They're here on the island!
- They're alive?

923
01:23:29,394 --> 01:23:31,624
- Helen?
- Hello.

924
01:23:31,696 --> 01:23:33,994
You must be Mrs...

925
01:23:34,532 --> 01:23:36,898
- She was helping me to escape.
- No.

926
01:23:36,968 --> 01:23:38,492
That's what I was doing.

927
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:39,969
Let go of me!

928
01:23:40,038 --> 01:23:43,201
Let go, you lousy, lying,
unfaithful creep!

929
01:23:44,542 --> 01:23:47,010
How could I betray the perfect woman?

930
01:23:47,078 --> 01:23:50,309
- Oh, you're referring to me now?
- Where are the kids?

931
01:23:50,382 --> 01:23:52,282
- They triggered the alert.
- What?

932
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:55,683
- Security's in the jungle. Get going.
- Our kids are in danger?

933
01:23:55,754 --> 01:23:58,052
If you suspected danger,
why'd you bring them?

934
01:23:58,123 --> 01:24:01,217
They stowed away.
You're not striking the proper tone.

935
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,731
- Think they're supers?
- Dash, remember what Mom said.

936
01:24:12,804 --> 01:24:14,294
- What?
- Stop talking!

937
01:24:14,372 --> 01:24:17,398
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Dash, run!

938
01:24:17,475 --> 01:24:19,602
- What?
- Run!

939
01:24:20,278 --> 01:24:23,076
- They're supers!
- Get the boy!

940
01:24:24,149 --> 01:24:25,639
Show yourself!

941
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:54,597
I'm alive. Yeah!

942
01:27:07,445 --> 01:27:10,073
I should've told you I was fired,
I admit it.

943
01:27:10,148 --> 01:27:11,775
But I didn't want you to worry.

944
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:13,317
You didn't want me to worry?

945
01:27:13,384 --> 01:27:16,285
We're running for our lives
through some godforsaken jungle.

946
01:27:16,354 --> 01:27:19,551
You keep trying to pick a fight,
but I'm just happy you're alive.

947
01:27:21,526 --> 01:27:24,495
I know you're there,
Little Miss Disappear.

948
01:27:36,908 --> 01:27:38,933
You can't hide from me.

949
01:27:45,149 --> 01:27:47,515
- There you are.
- Hey!

950
01:27:51,756 --> 01:27:54,247
Don't touch my sister!

951
01:28:01,432 --> 01:28:03,593
- How are you doing that?
- I don't know!

952
01:28:03,668 --> 01:28:05,363
Whatever you do, don't stop!

953
01:28:21,819 --> 01:28:23,616
Mom! Dad! Hey!

954
01:28:25,523 --> 01:28:26,751
Kids.

955
01:28:26,824 --> 01:28:28,689
- You're all right.
- You're all right.

956
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,627
- We were so worried.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

957
01:28:49,781 --> 01:28:51,408
- I love you.
- I love you.

958
01:29:07,065 --> 01:29:08,726
Time out!

959
01:29:10,468 --> 01:29:13,699
What have we here?
Matching uniforms?

960
01:29:14,539 --> 01:29:19,238
Oh, no! Elastigirl?

961
01:29:19,644 --> 01:29:23,239
You married Elastigirl?

962
01:29:23,948 --> 01:29:26,314
And got busy!

963
01:29:26,384 --> 01:29:29,114
It's a whole family of supers.

964
01:29:29,187 --> 01:29:31,348
Looks like I've hit the jackpot!

965
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:33,787
This is just too good!

966
01:29:33,858 --> 01:29:37,453
<i>- The ship's unique design...</i>
<i>- There were no fatalities...</i>

967
01:29:39,097 --> 01:29:42,430
Oh, come on!
You gotta admit, this is cool.

968
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:45,833
Just like a movie!
The robot will emerge dramatically,

969
01:29:45,903 --> 01:29:48,804
do some damage.
Throngs of screaming people!

970
01:29:48,873 --> 01:29:53,640
And just when all hope is lost,
Syndrome will save the day!

971
01:29:53,711 --> 01:29:56,271
I'll be a bigger hero
than you ever were!

972
01:29:56,347 --> 01:30:00,374
You mean you killed off real heroes
so that you could pretend to be one?

973
01:30:00,451 --> 01:30:03,852
I'm real.
Real enough to defeat you!

974
01:30:03,921 --> 01:30:07,652
And I did it without your precious
gifts, your oh-so-special powers.

975
01:30:07,725 --> 01:30:09,192
I'll give them heroics.

976
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:12,320
I'll give them the most spectacular
heroics anyone's ever seen!

977
01:30:12,397 --> 01:30:15,798
And when I'm old and I've had my fun,
I'll sell my inventions

978
01:30:15,867 --> 01:30:20,429
so that everyone can be superheroes.
Everyone can be super.

979
01:30:20,505 --> 01:30:23,372
And when everyone's super...

980
01:30:25,777 --> 01:30:27,506
...no one will be.

981
01:31:03,281 --> 01:31:05,306
<i>It's overwhelming the tanks.</i>

982
01:31:05,383 --> 01:31:06,850
I'm sorry.

983
01:31:06,918 --> 01:31:10,945
This is my fault.
I've been a lousy father.

984
01:31:11,022 --> 01:31:14,822
Blind to what I have.
So obsessed with being undervalued

985
01:31:14,892 --> 01:31:18,020
- that I undervalued all of you.
- Dad?

986
01:31:18,096 --> 01:31:19,085
Don't interrupt.

987
01:31:19,163 --> 01:31:21,961
So caught up in the past that I...

988
01:31:23,534 --> 01:31:27,402
You are my greatest adventure.
And I almost missed it.

989
01:31:27,472 --> 01:31:30,464
I swear, I'm gonna get us
out of this safely if I...

990
01:31:30,541 --> 01:31:34,375
Well, I think Dad has made
some excellent progress today

991
01:31:34,445 --> 01:31:37,209
but I think it's time we wind down now.

992
01:31:39,884 --> 01:31:41,875
We need to get back to the mainland.

993
01:31:41,953 --> 01:31:44,478
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in.
Straight ahead.

994
01:31:54,398 --> 01:31:56,161
Where are all the guards?

995
01:31:56,234 --> 01:31:57,701
Go, go!

996
01:32:01,639 --> 01:32:04,733
Hey, every time they run,
you take a shot.

997
01:32:20,925 --> 01:32:23,587
This is the right hangar,
but I don't see any jets.

998
01:32:23,661 --> 01:32:26,687
- A jet's not fast enough.
- What's faster than a jet?

999
01:32:26,764 --> 01:32:28,698
How about a rocket?

1000
01:32:31,636 --> 01:32:35,697
- Great! I can't fly a rocket.
- You don't have to.

1001
01:32:35,773 --> 01:32:38,537
Use the coordinates
from the last launch.

1002
01:32:40,378 --> 01:32:44,041
Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed
the password by now.

1003
01:32:44,115 --> 01:32:46,879
- How do I get into the computer?
<i>- Say please.</i>

1004
01:33:02,633 --> 01:33:04,624
- Honey?
- What?

1005
01:33:04,702 --> 01:33:06,670
- Where is my supersuit?
- What?

1006
01:33:06,737 --> 01:33:10,264
Where is my supersuit?

1007
01:33:10,341 --> 01:33:13,333
- I put it away.
- Where?

1008
01:33:13,411 --> 01:33:15,811
Why do you need to know?

1009
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:16,938
I need it!

1010
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:20,074
Don't you think about running off
to doing no derrin'-do.

1011
01:33:20,151 --> 01:33:22,711
We've been planning
this dinner for two months!

1012
01:33:22,787 --> 01:33:25,585
- The public is in danger!
- My evening's in danger!

1013
01:33:25,656 --> 01:33:29,251
Tell me where my suit is, woman!
We are talking about the greater good.

1014
01:33:29,327 --> 01:33:31,420
"Greater good"? I am your wife!

1015
01:33:31,495 --> 01:33:34,589
I'm the greatest good
you are ever gonna get!

1016
01:33:37,969 --> 01:33:38,993
Run!

1017
01:33:41,172 --> 01:33:42,571
My baby!

1018
01:33:46,844 --> 01:33:49,210
- The supers have returned!
- Is that Fironic?

1019
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:52,841
- Fironic?
- No, Fironic has a different outfit.

1020
01:33:52,917 --> 01:33:57,718
No, no, I'm a new superhero!
I'm Syndrome!

1021
01:34:00,691 --> 01:34:02,158
All right, stand back.

1022
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:11,163
Someone needs to teach
this hunk of metal a few manners.

1023
01:34:40,898 --> 01:34:44,698
- Are we there yet?
- We get there when we get there.

1024
01:34:46,737 --> 01:34:48,898
How you doing, honey?

1025
01:34:48,973 --> 01:34:51,874
Do I have to answer?

1026
01:34:53,911 --> 01:34:57,176
Kids, strap yourselves down
like I told you.

1027
01:35:00,985 --> 01:35:03,112
Here we go, honey.

1028
01:35:03,621 --> 01:35:07,113
Ready, Violet? Ready?

1029
01:35:07,191 --> 01:35:08,385
Now!

1030
01:35:11,429 --> 01:35:12,953
This is gonna be rough.

1031
01:35:20,438 --> 01:35:22,770
Robot's in the financial district.
Which exit?

1032
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:25,138
- Traction Avenue.
- That'll take me downtown.

1033
01:35:25,209 --> 01:35:27,643
- I take Seventh, don't I?
- Don't take Seventh!

1034
01:35:27,712 --> 01:35:30,374
- Great, we missed it.
- Ask how to get there, I told you.

1035
01:35:30,448 --> 01:35:32,313
- Traction.
- That'll take me downtown.

1036
01:35:32,383 --> 01:35:34,180
Get in the right lane! Signal!

1037
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:36,412
- Not Traction!
- You're gonna miss it!

1038
01:36:03,014 --> 01:36:05,676
Is everybody okay back there?

1039
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:09,413
- Super-duper, Dad!
- Let's do that again.

1040
01:36:12,056 --> 01:36:15,253
Wait here and stay hidden.
I'm going in.

1041
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:18,654
While what?
I watch helplessly from the sidelines?

1042
01:36:18,729 --> 01:36:21,493
- I don't think so.
- I'm asking you to wait with the kids.

1043
01:36:21,565 --> 01:36:24,090
And I'm telling you not a chance.
You're my husband.

1044
01:36:24,168 --> 01:36:25,897
I'm with you for better or worse.

1045
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:28,097
I have to do this alone.

1046
01:36:28,172 --> 01:36:30,231
- What is this to you? Playtime?
- No.

1047
01:36:30,307 --> 01:36:32,104
- So you can be Mr. Incredible?
- No!

1048
01:36:32,176 --> 01:36:33,734
- Then what?
- I'm not...

1049
01:36:33,811 --> 01:36:35,574
- Not what?
- I'm not strong enough.

1050
01:36:35,646 --> 01:36:37,511
- This will make you stronger?
- Yes. No!

1051
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:39,674
That's what this is?
A workout?

1052
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:42,310
I can't lose you again!

1053
01:36:43,254 --> 01:36:46,223
I can't. Not again.

1054
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:48,656
I'm not... strong enough.

1055
01:36:57,034 --> 01:36:59,969
If we work together,
you won't have to be.

1056
01:37:00,037 --> 01:37:01,868
I don't know what'll happen.

1057
01:37:01,939 --> 01:37:04,737
We're superheroes.
What can happen?

1058
01:37:08,946 --> 01:37:10,777
Vi! Dash! No!

1059
01:37:20,724 --> 01:37:21,816
Violet?

1060
01:37:25,196 --> 01:37:27,721
- Dad!
- Go, go!

1061
01:37:37,408 --> 01:37:40,844
- I'm okay, Mom. Really.
- Stay here, okay?

1062
01:37:51,622 --> 01:37:52,919
Frozone!

1063
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:54,116
Yeah!

1064
01:37:57,228 --> 01:37:58,388
Bob!

1065
01:37:59,497 --> 01:38:00,486
Hey!

1066
01:38:16,814 --> 01:38:18,008
Syndrome's remote!

1067
01:38:27,758 --> 01:38:30,090
The remote controls the robot!

1068
01:38:32,763 --> 01:38:35,231
- Throw it, throw it!
- Go long!

1069
01:38:46,410 --> 01:38:47,536
Got it!

1070
01:38:52,449 --> 01:38:54,508
Honey, take out its guns!

1071
01:39:02,193 --> 01:39:03,421
Gotcha!

1072
01:39:48,672 --> 01:39:50,663
Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote!

1073
01:39:52,376 --> 01:39:54,742
A remote? A remote that controls what?

1074
01:39:58,148 --> 01:39:59,137
The robot?

1075
01:40:07,324 --> 01:40:08,313
It's coming back!

1076
01:40:11,862 --> 01:40:13,989
- That wasn't right.
- Give me that!

1077
01:40:14,865 --> 01:40:18,198
We can't stop it. The only thing
hard enough to penetrate it is...

1078
01:40:21,739 --> 01:40:23,001
...itself.

1079
01:40:23,073 --> 01:40:24,563
It's getting closer!

1080
01:40:24,642 --> 01:40:26,234
- It doesn't work!
- Kids!

1081
01:40:28,379 --> 01:40:29,710
It's not doing anything.

1082
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:32,271
- Try to buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.

1083
01:40:37,354 --> 01:40:38,480
Honey!

1084
01:40:44,595 --> 01:40:46,995
Wait a minute.
Press that button again!

1085
01:40:48,299 --> 01:40:52,599
- No, the other one! The first one!
- First button! Got it!

1086
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:55,002
- It's getting closer!
- Look out!

1087
01:40:55,072 --> 01:40:57,802
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.

1088
01:40:57,875 --> 01:40:59,604
- Press the button!
- Not yet!

1089
01:40:59,677 --> 01:41:02,168
- Hang on!
- What are you waiting for?

1090
01:41:02,246 --> 01:41:04,476
A closer target! You got one shot!

1091
01:41:08,085 --> 01:41:09,518
Everybody duck!

1092
01:41:32,476 --> 01:41:33,602
Hey, Zone.

1093
01:41:40,718 --> 01:41:42,049
No!

1094
01:41:42,119 --> 01:41:46,180
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.

1095
01:41:46,256 --> 01:41:50,420
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.

1096
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:56,595
- Just like old times.
- Just like old times.

1097
01:41:56,667 --> 01:41:58,965
Yeah. Hurt then too.

1098
01:42:01,905 --> 01:42:04,373
We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets.

1099
01:42:04,441 --> 01:42:08,036
If he even sneezes, we'll be there
with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

1100
01:42:08,112 --> 01:42:10,410
The people of this country
are indebted to you.

1101
01:42:10,481 --> 01:42:12,381
Can we come out of hiding?

1102
01:42:12,449 --> 01:42:14,508
Let the politicians figure that out.

1103
01:42:14,585 --> 01:42:18,112
I've been asked to assure you
we'll take care of everything else.

1104
01:42:18,188 --> 01:42:19,280
You did good, Bob.

1105
01:42:19,356 --> 01:42:21,347
<i>Hi, this is Kari.</i>

1106
01:42:21,425 --> 01:42:24,326
<i>I have a question about Jack-Jack...</i>

1107
01:42:24,395 --> 01:42:26,192
Come on. We're in a limo.

1108
01:42:26,263 --> 01:42:29,130
Hey, you're wearing your hair back?

1109
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:32,066
- Yeah, I just... yeah.
- It looks good.

1110
01:42:32,136 --> 01:42:34,798
- Thanks, Dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!

1111
01:42:34,872 --> 01:42:37,397
Not as cool as you running on water.

1112
01:42:37,474 --> 01:42:41,001
That was sweet when you
snagged that bad guy with your arm

1113
01:42:41,078 --> 01:42:43,945
and whiplashed him into the other guy.
Sweet!

1114
01:42:44,014 --> 01:42:46,847
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
<i>- Mrs. Parr, it's me.</i>

1115
01:42:46,917 --> 01:42:50,478
<i>Jack-Jack is fine,</i>
<i>but weird things are happening.</i>

1116
01:42:50,554 --> 01:42:54,115
<i>Jack-Jack's still fine,</i>
<i>but I'm getting really weirded out!</i>

1117
01:42:54,191 --> 01:42:55,783
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

1118
01:42:55,859 --> 01:42:58,259
...aced those guys
that tried to kill us!

1119
01:42:58,328 --> 01:43:02,389
That was the best vacation ever!
I love our family.

1120
01:43:02,466 --> 01:43:05,333
<i>I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr!</i>

1121
01:43:05,402 --> 01:43:08,166
<i>Put that down! Stop it!</i>
<i>You need to call me.</i>

1122
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:10,468
<i>I need help, Mrs...</i>

1123
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:12,202
Bob, listen to this.

1124
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:14,301
<i>I'm gonna call the police...</i>

1125
01:43:14,378 --> 01:43:15,868
<i>Hi, this is Kari.</i>

1126
01:43:15,946 --> 01:43:20,144
<i>Sorry for freaking out,</i>
<i>but your baby has special needs.</i>

1127
01:43:20,217 --> 01:43:22,242
<i>Thanks for sending a replacement.</i>

1128
01:43:22,319 --> 01:43:25,049
I didn't call a replacement.

1129
01:43:30,561 --> 01:43:32,825
The baby is sleeping.

1130
01:43:35,232 --> 01:43:37,496
You took away my future.

1131
01:43:37,568 --> 01:43:41,004
I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

1132
01:43:41,071 --> 01:43:44,370
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.

1133
01:43:44,441 --> 01:43:48,377
And in time, who knows,
he might make a good sidekick.

1134
01:43:52,516 --> 01:43:55,815
He's getting away, Bob!
We have to do something.

1135
01:44:11,401 --> 01:44:12,868
What's happening?

1136
01:44:18,775 --> 01:44:21,938
- Stop him! Throw something!
- I might hit Jack-Jack.

1137
01:44:26,149 --> 01:44:27,616
Throw me.

1138
01:44:31,722 --> 01:44:33,189
Bob, throw me!

1139
01:44:39,396 --> 01:44:40,488
No!

1140
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:46,661
This isn't the end of it!
I will get your son, eventually.

1141
01:44:46,737 --> 01:44:48,068
I'll get your son!

1142
01:44:49,806 --> 01:44:51,000
Oh, no.

1143
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:06,187
Look at Mommy, honey.
Don't look down. Mommy's got you.

1144
01:45:06,256 --> 01:45:08,816
Everything is all right.

1145
01:45:23,801 --> 01:45:25,428
That's my girl.

1146
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:28,834
Does this mean we have to move again?

1147
01:45:31,909 --> 01:45:33,376
Oh, man.

1148
01:45:33,444 --> 01:45:36,242
That was totally wicked!

1149
01:45:53,259 --> 01:45:56,160
Do we have to have cheerleaders
at the track meet?

1150
01:45:56,229 --> 01:45:59,289
- What is that all about?
- I always thought it was more...

1151
01:45:59,366 --> 01:46:00,890
- Hey.
- Hey.

1152
01:46:00,967 --> 01:46:03,561
- You're Violet, right?
- That's me.

1153
01:46:03,636 --> 01:46:05,536
- See you, Vi.
- You look different.

1154
01:46:05,605 --> 01:46:08,938
I feel different. Is different okay?

1155
01:46:09,008 --> 01:46:12,239
Different is great.

1156
01:46:12,312 --> 01:46:14,610
Would you...

1157
01:46:14,681 --> 01:46:16,581
- Yeah?
- Do you think maybe...

1158
01:46:16,649 --> 01:46:18,241
- ...you and I...
- Yeah?

1159
01:46:18,318 --> 01:46:19,546
Do you...

1160
01:46:19,619 --> 01:46:22,520
I like movies.
I'll buy the popcorn. Okay?

1161
01:46:22,589 --> 01:46:26,423
A movie. There you go. Yeah.

1162
01:46:26,493 --> 01:46:29,360
- Wait, so Friday?
- Friday.

1163
01:46:33,366 --> 01:46:34,594
- Go, Dash, go.
- Run!

1164
01:46:36,469 --> 01:46:38,869
Come on, run! Pick up the pace.

1165
01:46:38,938 --> 01:46:40,269
Run!

1166
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:41,705
Pull back, pull back!

1167
01:46:41,775 --> 01:46:44,608
Pace it. Slow down just a little bit.

1168
01:46:44,677 --> 01:46:47,544
- Make it close!
- Second.

1169
01:46:47,614 --> 01:46:49,138
Close second, yeah!

1170
01:46:53,486 --> 01:46:55,818
That's my boy!

1171
01:46:55,889 --> 01:46:58,221
Dash, I'm so proud of you.

1172
01:46:58,291 --> 01:47:00,885
I didn't know what the heck
you wanted me to do.

1173
01:47:12,672 --> 01:47:15,641
Behold the Underminer!

1174
01:47:16,176 --> 01:47:18,644
I am always beneath you,

1175
01:47:18,711 --> 01:47:22,272
but nothing is beneath me!

1176
01:47:22,348 --> 01:47:28,651
I hereby declare war
on peace and happiness!

1177
01:47:28,721 --> 01:47:32,919
Soon all will tremble before me!
