00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,090
(suspenseful music)

00:00:39,597 --> 00:00:41,499
(whimpers)

5
00:01:28,913 --> 00:01:30,715
(screams)

00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:52,470
(princess moans)

00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:18,729
(screams)

00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:29,473
(groans)

00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:12,249
(electricity crackling)

10
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:34,972
(distant clatter)

11
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:37,807
Hey. Darling.

12
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:39,944
Darling.

13
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:42,512
Did you hear that?

14
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:44,047
(distant clatter)

15
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:47,551
I think someone's
in the house.

16
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,386
(sighs)
I don't hear anything, Ray.

17
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,856
- You're imagining.
- I'm not.

18
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:54,357
Then go check.

19
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:56,327
- Me?
- Yeah.

20
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,663
Chicken.

21
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,432
Oh, baby.

22
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:04,468
(distant clattering continues)

23
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,771
I'm gonna go check.

24
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:10,808
Yeah, you do that.

25
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:17,814
(camera beeps)

26
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:40,070
(light clattering)

27
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,087
She's not even there.

28
00:04:57,121 --> 00:05:00,558
When you open your eyes,
nothing's gonna be there.

29
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,427
Just gonna go to bed.

30
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:10,668
You are the chosen one.

31
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:21,579
(animal growls)

32
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,644
Maiden...

33
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:58,515
(sighs)
mother...

34
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:01,519
crow...

35
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,844
(hummingbird chirps)

36
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:34,919
Cannot believe
they're making this crap.

37
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:38,656
Found footage.
That's never been done before.

38
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:41,859
I bet it's based
on true events too.

39
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:43,726
Yep.
Right there on the front.

40
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,663
"Based on true events."

41
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:49,133
It's ridiculous.
Absolutely ridiculous.

42
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,036
You know, how come the
found footage is always edited?

43
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,772
Lilly.

44
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:58,642
You are so salty.

45
00:06:58,674 --> 00:07:00,877
Grammar alone is infantile.

46
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:02,146
(sighs)

47
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:03,580
I'm getting paid.

48
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:04,748
Yeah, I hope so.

49
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,217
I'm getting paid a bonus too.

50
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,818
Bonus?

51
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:11,054
Yeah. Well, if I go viral,
I get a bonus.

52
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:14,258
You know, someone should really
teach them the difference

53
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,993
between "there" "their"
and "they are."

54
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:19,997
Shh. Honey,
I am trying to focus.

55
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:22,500
No, I mean, look at this.
Your character's a medium, right?

56
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:24,801
A medium and a dominatrix.

57
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:30,007
Yeah. Who cons some
poor old man with tarot cards.

58
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,210
He is a real life ghost
in the South.

59
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:35,713
I'm thinking
about channeling him.

60
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,015
And then, on page ten,

61
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:41,185
needless to say you hardly
know each other at that point,

62
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:43,020
what's with the bondage?

63
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:45,055
(sighs)
Are you jealous?

64
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:47,056
Seems gratuitous.

65
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:49,859
(sighs) I don't buy the whole
past life thing either.

66
00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:52,162
Then why do you jump out of bed
in the middle of the night

67
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:54,665
like you see ghosts?

68
00:07:54,698 --> 00:07:56,032
Cry.

69
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:57,935
That shit's not real.

70
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,770
My subconscious
goes crazy when I sleep,

71
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:02,640
and dreams may occur.

72
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:04,708
May occur?

73
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:06,777
How the hell you gonna
physically sleep

74
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,746
with a ghost anyways?

75
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,714
They're already dead.

76
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:15,585
"T-H-E-Y"
apostrophe "R-E" dead.

77
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:18,822
You're an asshole.

78
00:08:18,854 --> 00:08:23,226
Y-O-U apostrophe
R-E an asshole.

79
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:26,796
What? I...

80
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,133
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my girl.

81
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,169
This is about to be the best
of all the possession movies.

82
00:08:32,202 --> 00:08:34,572
Like, "The Exorcist"
or some shit.

83
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:36,707
And I'm telling you right now,

84
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,676
it ain't gonna be none of that remake
bullshit that Hollywood's into,

85
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,876
'cause I hate that shit.

86
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,279
I'm so excited.

87
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:44,081
You got another box.

88
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:46,317
I'm chatting
with the director.

89
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,885
Hey.

90
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,787
Sup, boss man?

91
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:52,989
Honey, you're going to be on
my fan-site video for the movie.

92
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:55,259
Chaz is recording us right now.

93
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:57,294
Eh, me out.

94
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:59,663
Sorry, Ray
just likes his privacy,

95
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:02,366
but he's just cranky,
Mr. Cranky Pants,

96
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,034
because he was up
all night writing.

97
00:09:05,068 --> 00:09:07,236
Drinking, more like it.
(laughs)

98
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,973
I hope there ain't going to be
no problems with this Ray cat.

99
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:12,609
- Know what I'm saying?
- No. Why?

100
00:09:12,643 --> 00:09:14,612
I don't know, you know.
You just said, like...

101
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:17,313
that we could film you at my
crib and shit when we cast you.

102
00:09:17,347 --> 00:09:20,650
Like this behind the scenes
look at a professional actress.

103
00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:22,019
Yeah, of course.

104
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:24,955
By the way,
your house is amazing.

105
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:26,957
You know that when
you sign that contract,

106
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,827
there's this little section that
says "any and all footage..."

107
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,196
Ray will be fine.

108
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:33,329
No problemo.

109
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:35,799
I see you got my package.

110
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:37,735
Oh, I did.
Oh, my God.

111
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:38,769
What is it?

112
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:41,839
Unfiltered, baby.
(laughs)

113
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,373
Can you dig it?

114
00:09:43,406 --> 00:09:47,744
I have to warn you,
I'm like, totally method now.

115
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:51,281
Like, Ray thinks I can be
a little scary and weird.

116
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:53,950
Shit, scary and weird?
That's our business.

117
00:09:53,983 --> 00:09:55,685
See that right there,
that's what the horror fans...

118
00:09:55,718 --> 00:09:57,153
that's what they wanna see,
baby.

119
00:09:57,187 --> 00:09:58,789
Well, I mean,
I have a fan base,

120
00:09:58,822 --> 00:09:59,923
but it could so be better.

121
00:09:59,956 --> 00:10:01,825
It will after this movie,
baby.

122
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:03,693
You gonna be a movie star.

123
00:10:03,726 --> 00:10:05,663
Say it with me.
Movie star.

124
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:08,432
Yay. Thank you.
I am so excited.

125
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:10,367
And you going viral.

126
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,437
Honey, do you hear that?
♪ I'm gonna go viral ♪

127
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,439
- ♪ I'm gonna go viral ♪
- ♪ Gonna go viral ♪

128
00:10:15,472 --> 00:10:17,374
♪ Gonna go viral ♪
Hey.

129
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:20,276
Skin is a scream queen's
necessity, yo.

130
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:23,946
I promise Ray
will bare it all for you.

131
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,151
(laughs)

132
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:28,919
Shit.
You is funny, girl.

133
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:31,422
But, for real, like, I don't
wanna have to recast you.

134
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:33,756
Like, if your videos
ain't getting watched,

135
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:35,892
and, like, people aren't
liking that shit...

136
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:38,027
Oh, God. Really?

137
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,229
I'm just playing with you.
I ain't gonna recast your ass.

138
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:42,066
- You.
- (laughs)

139
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:43,733
You should have seen
your face, though.

140
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:46,703
Thanks again for this fab cam
and cool statue.

141
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:50,339
I will totally do a bitchin'
unboxing video later for you.

142
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:52,742
Hey, guys,
it's Box Girl Lilly.

143
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:55,178
So I just got this
awesome new huge box

144
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:57,146
I can't wait to open
for you guys.

145
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:58,848
It's from my director.

146
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:02,185
It says, "Lilly, you're
the next big scream queen.

147
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:03,886
Sincerely, Chaz."

148
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,790
What is that?
Oh, this is hot.

149
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:09,058
What do you guys think?

150
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:12,730
Should I try it on?
This looks tight.

151
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:14,865
It is tight.

152
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:20,404
Whoa. Cool, right?

153
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:22,206
Super weird.

154
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,110
You and me, we're going
to make a masterpiece together.

155
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:30,414
(ominous music)

156
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:36,520
What up, my paranormalists?

157
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:40,424
It's time for your favorite
podcast, "Beyond Paranormal."

158
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:44,528
I am your host and fellow freak
Juice McDaniels.

159
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,398
Our special guest this month is
world renowned quantum physicist

160
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:52,202
Dr. Ulrich von Strauss.

161
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:54,972
And today we will be asking
the question

162
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,039
"Is time travel possible?"

163
00:11:57,073 --> 00:12:00,910
Better question,
do you travel in time

164
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:02,979
or does time travel to you?

165
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,783
Time and space can
be manipulated,

166
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:08,952
fused together
and then displaced

167
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:12,356
to create a window to
a completely different reality.

168
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,924
Realities are what we make.
Ain't that right, Doc?

169
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:19,896
Some of us live in between
realities and dimensions.

170
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:21,931
You think
we are not alone?

171
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,802
Oh, absolutely
we're not alone.

172
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:27,370
We've been visited
by many alien life forms...

173
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:29,405
many alien life forms...

174
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,912
(laughs)

175
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:37,481
I'm writing.

176
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,251
Did you sign
the release form yet?

177
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,827
Don't worry,
I'll get him to sign.

178
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,063
These "ver" glasses are like
looking into another dimension.

179
00:12:54,097 --> 00:13:00,404
This is my first...
ASMR video.

180
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:03,173
Robert, thank you so much
for the bear.

181
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:05,943
Oh, he's so cute
and so fluffy,

182
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:08,111
like a little white cloud.

183
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:10,514
I'm going to sleep with him
right now.

184
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:13,884
Oh, yeah, I can't "bear"
to sleep without him.

185
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,986
Don't be jealous, Ray.

186
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:23,492
Oh, shoot.

187
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:25,261
Well, that's not good.

188
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:29,232
Hey, everybody,
it's Box Girl Lilly.

189
00:13:29,265 --> 00:13:33,002
Welcome to Lilly vloggin'
the vlog.

190
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:35,171
(clears throat)
Okay.

191
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:41,245
Hey, guys, Lilly here again.

192
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,181
So this is harder
than I thought.

193
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:46,215
Um...

194
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:49,253
But you guys will
totally dig the next video,

195
00:13:49,285 --> 00:13:52,088
and don't forget
to hit the like button.

196
00:13:57,026 --> 00:13:59,028
"Don't forget to tune in
and hit the like button."

197
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:01,465
Hit the like button,
people.

198
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:06,236
Hey, guys,
are you ready?

199
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,312
(groans) Babe, will you
scratch my back, please?

200
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:19,116
(sighs) This novel
is driving me crazy.

201
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,585
Ugh. It's like
I'm writing in circles.

202
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:25,488
Mm-hmm.

203
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:27,690
What's with the creepy statue?

204
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:29,625
Oh, I know.
Cool, right?

205
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:31,962
Yeah.

206
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:34,498
If by "cool"
you mean super creepy.

207
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,266
Yeah, it's cool.
It's really cool. (sighs)

208
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:39,535
Can you please not
bring evil shit in the house

209
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:41,438
that may have
evil shit attached to it?

210
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:43,674
(moans)
Like what?

211
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:46,009
Like,
you know what I mean.

212
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:48,145
- Stuff.
- What stuff?

213
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,413
Evil shit
can attach to things,

214
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:52,215
and those things
can attach to us.

215
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:54,150
Like bedbugs.

216
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:56,352
I'm serious.

217
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:58,587
I promise,
no evil parasitic juju.

218
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:00,156
This isn't a joke.

219
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:03,492
Ow!
Is that real bone?

220
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:06,563
My director thought
it would inspire creativity,

221
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:08,966
Speaking of creativity,

222
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:13,003
I think my brain's
been sucked all of mine.

223
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:16,973
Oh, you're bleeding.

224
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:20,310
You just need to relax.

225
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:24,380
You know I need to write.

226
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:28,684
Is this house not the best
writing retreat ever?

227
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:30,087
It's okay.

228
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,221
Have you seen
the hot tub?

229
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:32,556
Hello.

230
00:15:32,588 --> 00:15:34,390
I can't bring the computer
into the hot tub.

231
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:36,625
You're so cranky.

232
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,295
What? My editor's
breathing down my neck.

233
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:41,198
I mean, my advance
is almost gone,

234
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,532
and as soon
as we get back home,

235
00:15:42,564 --> 00:15:44,166
we're gonna have a stack
of bills waiting for us.

236
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:47,236
Honey, my website Patreon
is killing it right now,

237
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,508
and I'm making a movie,
so don't worry about money.

238
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,310
That's easy for you to say.

239
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:59,716
I know what you need
for inspiration.

240
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:01,084
(laughs)

241
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:02,551
What are you...

242
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:05,454
- Mm.
- (sighs)

243
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:07,056
Oh, that's...

244
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,258
so...

245
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,693
(ominous music)
That's...

246
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:13,697
Oh, God, that's good.

247
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,733
What is that?

248
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,236
Uh, a camera.

249
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,571
Is it on?

250
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:23,606
Mm-hmm.
You want me to stop?

251
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,342
- Uh, yes.
- Yeah?

252
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,577
- Ah. No.
- No?

253
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,413
- No.
- Stop?

254
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,249
Ugh.
how do I turn it off?

255
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:34,350
(breathing heavily)

256
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:38,288
Oh, God,
where's the off button?

257
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:40,490
Oh, babe,
how do I shut it off?

258
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:42,092
Oh.

259
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:48,131
(ominous music)

260
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:24,834
Babe.
Did you see that light?

261
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:31,707
You're sleepwalking.

262
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,677
No, I'm not sleepwalk...

263
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,380
Lilly. Lilly.

264
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:39,782
There's someone
standing over you.

265
00:17:42,284 --> 00:17:46,122
- You're dreaming.
- No, I am not dreaming.

266
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:53,230
Where?

267
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:59,468
Shit.

268
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:01,138
I must be dreaming.

269
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,780
Geek it down
a little bit here, fellas.

270
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:14,583
I gotta call
my girl anyway, so...

271
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:16,419
get the fuck out of here.

272
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:17,621
Why bother?

273
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:19,221
I can just hack
into her webcam

274
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:21,224
and you can
remotely broadcast.

275
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:23,759
Word?

276
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:26,463
Shit, that's like some
big brother shit right there.

277
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:28,532
(laughs)

278
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:31,400
Now we in your house
and you don't even know it.

279
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:32,601
(laughs)

280
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:34,938
Read 'em and weep, boys.

281
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,909
That's what I'm talking
about, girl. (laughs)

282
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:41,377
Oh, hello.

283
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,712
I didn't know anyone
was there.

284
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:45,649
Hey, how'd you get him to sign
the release form, Lilly?

285
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:47,918
Never underestimate a woman.

286
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,356
Baby girl,
I knew you would deliver,

287
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,958
and I got to say,

288
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:58,895
you and your man boy
make some pretty great pixels.

289
00:18:58,928 --> 00:19:01,231
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

290
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,666
But I'm just... I'm worried

291
00:19:02,698 --> 00:19:04,767
because not too many people
have watched.

292
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:07,504
Girl, people gonna watch
the shit if it's scary.

293
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:09,271
And guess what?

294
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:11,640
Might be a little extra
bonus pay for you if it's hot.

295
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:14,376
(laughs)
Feel me?

296
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:16,246
Oh, it will be.

297
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:17,846
By the way, how am I doing
with the camera?

298
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,616
Fantastic, Lilly.

299
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:22,785
You're broadcasting
as we speak.

300
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:24,721
So when can I see
some footage?

301
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:30,659
Oh, shit, girl,
I'ma show you the footage.

302
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:33,963
I know, I just... I feel like
I'm, like, I don't know.

303
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:35,465
I'm, just, like,
this insecure artist.

304
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:37,467
I'm like...
I'm crazy. So...

305
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:39,001
what can I do to help?

306
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:40,570
Know what? I got it.

307
00:19:40,602 --> 00:19:43,406
You gonna take the red light
on the camera,

308
00:19:43,438 --> 00:19:45,275
and you gonna mark it out

309
00:19:45,307 --> 00:19:48,310
and then you won't know when we
filming and when we not filming.

310
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:49,879
That's genius.

311
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:52,881
(laughs)
Sometimes it happens that way.

312
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:54,684
I... I can't control the shit.

313
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:57,520
Well, I have to tell you I can't
video-chat with you anymore

314
00:19:57,553 --> 00:19:59,488
because my character
wouldn't do that.

315
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:00,890
'Cause you method and shit.

316
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:02,525
That's why I hired you, mama.

317
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:04,393
I like it. I like it a lot.

318
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:05,795
(groans)

319
00:20:07,897 --> 00:20:11,968
Lilly isn't here anymore...

320
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:18,007
minion.

321
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,877
My name is Roxanne.

322
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:25,515
Now and how.

323
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:28,952
Just kidding.

324
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:32,322
All right, guys. See ya.
Thank you. Bye bye.

325
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:35,625
(ominous music)

326
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,003
What up,
my conspiracy realists?

327
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:49,371
I am your host,
Juice McDaniels.

328
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:52,475
It's Beyond Paranormal.

329
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:55,511
Look, let's just dive
right into it, flat Earthers.

330
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:57,546
You ever sleep
with your eyes open?

331
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,816
Do you see things
that don't exist?

332
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:03,086
Or perhaps you find yourself
lying on the floor.

333
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:05,455
(Lilly singing indistinct)

334
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:06,989
And I'm not talking about
partying the night before.

335
00:21:07,023 --> 00:21:10,726
Maybe, just maybe you're
a vessel for traveling

336
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,528
into another dimension.

337
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,831
Babe,
I'm trying to concentrate.

338
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:17,600
Juice: Today we will look
into outer body experiences

339
00:21:17,632 --> 00:21:20,536
and the dangers
that lurk in your...

340
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:29,578
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

341
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:32,481
Come on. You gotta
be freaking kidding me.

342
00:21:32,515 --> 00:21:34,751
Babe,
did you touch anything?

343
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,033
(Lilly exhales)

344
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:54,603
Lilly meditates to thrust
herself into character.

345
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:56,505
You know, babe, I...

346
00:21:56,538 --> 00:22:00,142
I might have figured out my
inciting incident for my book.

347
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:03,380
(sighs)

348
00:22:03,412 --> 00:22:05,381
(Southern accent)
What you whinin' about?

349
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:08,518
Ain't no thing
but a chicken wing.

350
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:10,419
You got taters
in your ears?

351
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:11,454
Oh, baby.

352
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:13,823
- (hisses)
- (groans)

353
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:22,731
This is Lilly
really getting into character.

354
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:24,400
Who are you this time, babe?

355
00:22:24,434 --> 00:22:25,769
You got anything to drink?

356
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,405
I'm so God dang thirsty
right now.

357
00:22:28,438 --> 00:22:29,938
You know we're out of milk.

358
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:32,141
You got some browns?

359
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:33,877
Excuse me.

360
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:36,646
My daddy used to say,
"Stay away from them browns,"

361
00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:39,615
but I sure
do like them.

362
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:43,119
Browns.

363
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:45,154
Bourbon.
Brown liquor.

364
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:48,091
Oh. Yeah.

365
00:22:48,123 --> 00:22:50,526
(slurps)

366
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,397
Why is this thing always...?

367
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,635
Where's that fine piece of ass
you got around here, hmm?

368
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,738
Pardon me?

369
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:04,006
Brunette.

370
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,476
Perfect little titties
made from God.

371
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:09,478
- Right.
- Ass of a teenager.

372
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:12,482
Mm-hmm.
You must mean Lilly.

373
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:16,186
- That your girl?
- Sometimes.

374
00:23:16,218 --> 00:23:18,822
No, that ain't her.

375
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:21,490
Got anything to eat?

376
00:23:21,524 --> 00:23:23,794
Oh.

377
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:32,101
Then you must mean
Miss Roxanne.

378
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,236
Yeah.

379
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:36,605
Yeah, that's the bitch.

380
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:40,709
She got one tight satchel.

381
00:23:40,743 --> 00:23:43,813
I been waiting a long time
to tap that...

382
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:47,950
Oh, maybe youse put in
a good word, huh?

383
00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:49,052
Yeah, I'll do that.

384
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:50,819
What's that thing?

385
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:52,054
Camera.

386
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:55,859
How about you
shut that shit off?

387
00:23:55,891 --> 00:23:58,894
I mean, technically, I'm really
not supposed to 'cause...

388
00:23:58,928 --> 00:24:02,832
How's about I take that camera
from your hand, boy,

389
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:04,733
and I shove it up
your God dang ass.

390
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:06,034
That's not funny, Lilly.

391
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:08,671
Done. I'm done.

392
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:32,529
Oh, shit.

393
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:44,707
Swear, this novel
is trying to kill me.

394
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:48,811
Now and how, minion.

395
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:51,914
Lie down or I'll
scratch it till it bleeds.

396
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,284
That's some outfit.

397
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:55,951
Do you like it?

398
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:57,620
My director picked it out.

399
00:24:57,652 --> 00:25:00,155
(sighs)
Of course he did.

400
00:25:00,188 --> 00:25:02,257
Silence.

401
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:06,062
You've been a bad little boy.

402
00:25:06,094 --> 00:25:09,698
Babe, with the creepy statue?
It really freaks me out.

403
00:25:09,732 --> 00:25:13,903
Ray, you said
you wouldn't be so judgey.

404
00:25:13,936 --> 00:25:16,139
What's with the scotch?

405
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:17,606
Helps me write.

406
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,008
Shut up, bed slave.

407
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:23,980
Now and how.

408
00:25:24,013 --> 00:25:26,082
I'm so fucked right now.

409
00:25:26,114 --> 00:25:27,983
My publisher wants pages.

410
00:25:28,016 --> 00:25:29,651
You should have seen
the email.

411
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:31,087
It's totally preposterous.

412
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,958
She wants the first
150 pages.

413
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,562
Ah. God.

414
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:42,666
Please, God, give me
a sign I should be a writer.

415
00:25:43,932 --> 00:25:45,634
(sighs)

416
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:49,272
Hey, I thought we both agreed
no filming bedroom stuff.

417
00:25:50,872 --> 00:25:53,008
Relax, baby.

418
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:56,580
It isn't on.

419
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:02,851
Do you need your muse?

420
00:26:02,884 --> 00:26:04,820
Yeah, where's she at?

421
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:07,323
Shut your mouth,
my love slave.

422
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:11,159
Now and how.

423
00:26:11,192 --> 00:26:13,629
- Now and how?
- Mm-hmm.

424
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:15,864
Okay.

425
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:18,834
"Okay" what?

426
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,639
Okay...

427
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:24,073
Roxanne.

428
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:27,075
- Aah.
- Miss Roxanne.

429
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:29,212
Miss Roxanne.

430
00:26:29,245 --> 00:26:31,714
Isn't my dominatrix name
so cool?

431
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:33,983
Yeah,
more like nymphomaniac.

432
00:26:34,015 --> 00:26:36,218
I read the script.

433
00:26:36,252 --> 00:26:39,088
Not super excited about
all the explicit sex stuff.

434
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:42,925
It's totally superfluous.
Who copulates with a corpse?

435
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:44,360
It's a metaphor.

436
00:26:44,392 --> 00:26:47,029
A metaphor.
In a horror movie.

437
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,331
Totally absurd.

438
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:50,932
Are you doing nudity
in this film?

439
00:26:50,966 --> 00:26:52,168
Sex sells.

440
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,269
You know that, Ray.

441
00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:00,342
(groans)

442
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:02,845
What...
What are you doing?

443
00:27:02,878 --> 00:27:07,417
I'm going to make my little Ray
rise from the dead.

444
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:11,453
Little Ray. I'm a grower, not a shower.
You know that.

445
00:27:11,486 --> 00:27:15,091
Okay. Well, let's see
how much little Ray...

446
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:18,827
I mean "big Ray," can grow.

447
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:22,365
Lilly...

448
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,767
Miss Roxanne.

449
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:28,737
Yes, my love slave?

450
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:33,976
- Now and how.
- Now?

451
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:38,214
I'm really tired.

452
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:44,920
Fine.

453
00:27:47,156 --> 00:27:50,159
- I thought you said it wasn't...
- (camera beeps)

454
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:59,869
And don't you dare wake me up
with one of your stupid dreams.

455
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,842
Little help.

456
00:29:47,543 --> 00:29:52,215
(chanting)

457
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,026
What a whackadoodle.

458
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:16,005
(chanting)

459
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:28,484
Traveling astrally
has been dated back

460
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:31,219
to the oldest of books.

461
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:34,657
Do you think it's possible
to meditate across the state?

462
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:37,293
I had the craziest
dream last...

463
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:39,461
With the right incantation,

464
00:30:39,495 --> 00:30:42,998
people have been able
to travel in time,

465
00:30:43,032 --> 00:30:44,433
space,

466
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:47,035
even across galaxies

467
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:50,573
with other worlds
and other species.

468
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:52,574
Oh, brother.

469
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:56,211
I have a collection of mantras
you can use

470
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:58,014
for such a journey.

471
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:02,084
Oh, thank you.

472
00:31:02,117 --> 00:31:05,121
Like, so generous.

473
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:10,959
You got any snake oil
for purchase?

474
00:31:10,993 --> 00:31:15,231
Remember,
traveling can be dangerous.

475
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:21,404
Evil horn dwellers can attach
themselves to the wandering soul.

476
00:31:21,437 --> 00:31:22,938
Evil horn dwellers.

477
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:25,640
Why would you...
Attach to who now?

478
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:27,208
Don't mind him.

479
00:31:27,242 --> 00:31:29,545
No, see,
this is exactly the kind

480
00:31:29,578 --> 00:31:32,014
of paranormal shit
I was talking about.

481
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:35,250
- Angela, meet...
- Raymond.

482
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:36,718
Have we met?

483
00:31:36,752 --> 00:31:40,121
Ah, no. Lilly must have
told me your name.

484
00:31:40,155 --> 00:31:42,458
Hello, Ray.

485
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,693
I need to write.

486
00:31:44,726 --> 00:31:46,662
Ray!

487
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:53,034
Yo, this girl's stupid,
but she mad good, though.

488
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:56,137
Yo, IT, while you're down there,
I could use a little release.

489
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,073
(laughs)

490
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:02,078
- We're all fixed.
- Hey, what?

491
00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:05,281
Both: Must have been
a power surge.

492
00:32:05,313 --> 00:32:07,350
So we up?

493
00:32:07,382 --> 00:32:09,217
Camera is live, bitches.

494
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:11,120
(laughs)
We live.

495
00:32:11,152 --> 00:32:15,024
All right, let's see
how much little Ray...

496
00:32:15,056 --> 00:32:19,227
I mean "big Ray," can grow.

497
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:20,997
Ray:
Oh, Miss Roxanne.

498
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:27,169
What?

499
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:30,138
What else
do I have to do?

500
00:32:35,444 --> 00:32:37,046
(sighs)

501
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:42,551
(breathing heavily)

502
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:52,561
(breathing heavily)

503
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:55,198
(growls)

504
00:32:56,698 --> 00:32:58,034
Jeez!

505
00:32:58,066 --> 00:33:00,101
Oh.

506
00:33:00,134 --> 00:33:03,238
You scared the hell
out of me.

507
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:06,275
(growls softly)

508
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:10,146
I'm just meditating, babe.

509
00:33:10,178 --> 00:33:11,714
Trying to give me
a heart attack.

510
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:13,681
(sighs)
Will you relax?

511
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:16,252
If I wanted to scare you,
it'd be easy.

512
00:33:16,284 --> 00:33:17,820
Next time you meditate,

513
00:33:17,852 --> 00:33:19,688
could you please keep
the covers on me?

514
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,289
It's hot in here.

515
00:33:21,323 --> 00:33:23,324
Only it's not hot.
It's freezing.

516
00:33:23,358 --> 00:33:25,528
I'm hot!

517
00:33:27,595 --> 00:33:31,366
(Lilly moans softly)

518
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,303
Come on now.
You know you want it.

519
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,444
Now and how.

520
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:45,614
I'm so hot...

521
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:48,818
you could fry an egg
on the hood of my ride.

522
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:52,121
Feel that heat
coming from my chassis.

523
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:53,788
Oh, yeah. Just...
Let's just kinda...

524
00:33:53,822 --> 00:33:56,758
Oh, my radiator's so hot.

525
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:59,227
My thermostat's about to pop.

526
00:33:59,261 --> 00:34:01,530
(moans)

527
00:34:01,563 --> 00:34:03,666
All right, Roxanne,
let's do this.

528
00:34:03,698 --> 00:34:08,570
(both moaning)

529
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:13,275
Oh, now... now...

530
00:34:13,307 --> 00:34:15,710
Oh, now. Now!

531
00:34:15,744 --> 00:34:18,146
Now! Aah!

532
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,849
And how!

533
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:22,784
Oh! Oh, God.

534
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:26,856
(moans)

535
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:38,834
Oh, you came really fast.

536
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:43,106
Sure could use a release.

537
00:34:54,615 --> 00:34:58,521
(thunder rumbling)

538
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:08,330
(baby crying)

539
00:35:08,363 --> 00:35:10,600
Shh.

540
00:35:51,572 --> 00:35:55,410
(baby continues crying)

541
00:36:18,532 --> 00:36:20,802
(speaks foreign language)

542
00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:32,881
(gasps)

543
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:58,006
Had the weirdest dream
last night.

544
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,378
(ominous music)

545
00:37:10,952 --> 00:37:13,789
Oh, yeah?
What about?

546
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:22,464
Nothin'.

547
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,709
Welcome back,
my comrades in conspiracy.

548
00:37:34,742 --> 00:37:37,478
Today,
significant spirit animals

549
00:37:37,512 --> 00:37:39,448
and how it relates
to your life.

550
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:43,017
Now, personally,
I like to gravitate towards more being...

551
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,520
(hisses)

552
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:55,396
Embody me with
all the light and darkness.

553
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:01,837
Invade my soul with
the gift of life everlasting.

554
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:05,840
I am your vessel.

555
00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:20,956
Yeah, it's the spirit animal.

556
00:38:20,988 --> 00:38:23,726
Many powerful women
in arts and literature.

557
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:32,901
(inhales sharply)

558
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:34,769
The only animal
that moves its wings

559
00:38:34,802 --> 00:38:36,104
in a figure-eight pattern...

560
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:41,008
...and other magical gifts

561
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:43,878
include healing
and the manipulation of time.

562
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,530
What... What do you mean
the manipulation of time?

563
00:39:02,564 --> 00:39:09,538
Well, it has the innate ability
to pause and move forward

564
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,139
and even back in time.

565
00:39:11,173 --> 00:39:13,709
And on the spiritual side,

566
00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:15,843
the tiny wing blossom dancer

567
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:17,945
reminds us to cherish the day.

568
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:20,616
Remember to hover
in the moment,

569
00:39:20,648 --> 00:39:24,185
my tortured tin-foil hatters.

570
00:39:24,218 --> 00:39:26,954
I think we all could learn
to appreciate the day...

571
00:39:26,988 --> 00:39:29,525
- Ugh.
- Stop and smell the roses.

572
00:39:29,557 --> 00:39:30,925
(groans)

573
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:34,563
Let's all drink deeply
in the nectar of life.

574
00:39:34,595 --> 00:39:36,831
Signing off.

575
00:39:39,534 --> 00:39:45,907
(indistinct
computerized voices)

576
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:48,143
Hey, babe?

577
00:39:48,175 --> 00:39:50,111
You hear that?

578
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:55,517
(computerized voices continue)

579
00:39:57,485 --> 00:39:59,721
Hello?

580
00:40:03,892 --> 00:40:05,494
(loud ringing)

581
00:40:05,526 --> 00:40:07,729
Aah! What the fuck?

582
00:40:07,762 --> 00:40:11,934
(groans)

583
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:14,537
Ray?

584
00:40:16,537 --> 00:40:17,840
What's that?

585
00:40:17,872 --> 00:40:20,175
Never mind.
Are you okay?

586
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:23,912
Maybe you should take a break.

587
00:40:23,945 --> 00:40:25,548
Earth to Ray.

588
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:27,983
Yeah.

589
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:29,584
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

590
00:40:29,617 --> 00:40:31,786
Maybe you
should take a break?

591
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:34,790
You don't look so good.

592
00:40:34,822 --> 00:40:36,691
And if you don't get out
of this black hole,

593
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:38,826
we might never get out.

594
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,262
Right. Yeah.
That's probably a good idea.

595
00:40:41,296 --> 00:40:43,966
Great, 'cause I have
to show you something cool.

596
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:47,602
But I'm gonna change first.

597
00:40:47,635 --> 00:40:50,672
Cool like the statue?

598
00:40:52,874 --> 00:40:55,211
(groans)

599
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,548
I'll be there in a minute.

600
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:08,657
(muttering)

601
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:21,871
I do not believe
what I just wrote.

602
00:41:23,137 --> 00:41:24,206
What is that?

603
00:41:24,238 --> 00:41:26,541
Tarot cards.

604
00:41:26,575 --> 00:41:28,810
Not those. That.

605
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:30,879
A Ouija board.

606
00:41:30,912 --> 00:41:33,948
Why? Why are you trying
to freak me out?

607
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:35,883
Let me read your cards,
Ray.

608
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:37,652
I'm good.

609
00:41:37,686 --> 00:41:39,220
Please, Ray.

610
00:41:39,253 --> 00:41:41,222
Fine.

611
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:43,926
How about you
read your own cards?

612
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,563
But can you read the meanings
for the camera?

613
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,967
(sighs)

614
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:58,240
They call this
a six-card lay.

615
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:00,342
(laughs)
You said "lay."

616
00:42:00,374 --> 00:42:03,077
- Maybe later if you're good.
- 'Kay.

617
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,846
Maybe I'll get to finish
this time.

618
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,615
And now you know
how I feel.

619
00:42:07,648 --> 00:42:11,753
The first card
is the inner child.

620
00:42:13,655 --> 00:42:15,223
The Fool.

621
00:42:15,256 --> 00:42:19,962
"The Fool represents
a free spirit of spontaneity."

622
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:26,134
The next three cards
represent consciousness.

623
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:31,139
Flip the next one.

624
00:42:31,171 --> 00:42:34,976
The fifth card
is subconscious.

625
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,713
The Devil? That's what's
in your subconscious?

626
00:42:37,746 --> 00:42:40,648
Read the meaning
in the book, Ray.

627
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:44,886
All right. It says the Devil
card represents bondage,

628
00:42:44,918 --> 00:42:46,887
sexuality, and addiction.

629
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:48,624
Oh, my God.

630
00:42:48,657 --> 00:42:51,626
That totally means that
I am thinking in character.

631
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,228
That's amazeballs.

632
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,963
Amazeballs? Where'd you get that one?
Acting class?

633
00:42:54,996 --> 00:42:57,733
Yeah, how'd you know?

634
00:42:57,765 --> 00:43:00,267
All right. Flip over
the last one, Miss Roxanne.

635
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,969
I gotta get back to writing.

636
00:43:02,003 --> 00:43:06,175
This card represents my future.

637
00:43:08,209 --> 00:43:10,412
Holy shit.
The Empress.

638
00:43:10,445 --> 00:43:13,015
What the hell
does that mean?

639
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:16,885
The Empress card. The Empress
card is the card of fertility.

640
00:43:16,918 --> 00:43:18,753
Oh.

641
00:43:18,787 --> 00:43:20,122
Oh shit.

642
00:43:20,155 --> 00:43:21,790
Are we having a baby?

643
00:43:21,822 --> 00:43:23,290
No, no.

644
00:43:23,323 --> 00:43:25,961
No. Not with my career
skyrocketing the way that it is.

645
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:27,796
Babe, nuh-uh. We are not
having sex ever again.

646
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:29,164
You keep that in your pants.
It's staying over there.

647
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:31,198
All right, just calm down.
Hey, calm down.

648
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:32,767
We're not having a baby.

649
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,735
Oh, God.
I feel nauseous.

650
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:36,371
- It's okay.
- Oh, I really do.

651
00:43:36,403 --> 00:43:37,238
- I feel nauseous.
- Look, we're not having a baby.

652
00:43:37,271 --> 00:43:38,673
That's a sign, isn't it?

653
00:43:38,706 --> 00:43:39,840
- (breathing heavily)
- It's okay.

654
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:41,410
Look, I'll tell you what.
Hey.

655
00:43:41,443 --> 00:43:43,078
Let's read my cards.

656
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:45,913
I'm sure they won't
even be close to the truth.

657
00:43:47,414 --> 00:43:49,117
Come on.

658
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:55,122
This is a three-card lay.

659
00:43:55,155 --> 00:43:59,860
The final card, slave,
is your future.

660
00:43:59,894 --> 00:44:05,133
See? No, see, I told you not to
bring evil shit in the house.

661
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:07,102
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just kidding.

662
00:44:07,135 --> 00:44:10,072
Honey, it was a joke.
I stacked the deck.

663
00:44:10,104 --> 00:44:11,439
Oh, great.
Real funny.

664
00:44:11,472 --> 00:44:12,940
Now I'm not going to be able
to sleep tonight.

665
00:44:12,974 --> 00:44:14,809
That's really funny.
It's not funny.

666
00:44:14,843 --> 00:44:17,111
No, but, babe,
I was just kidding.

667
00:44:17,144 --> 00:44:20,081
By the way, there'll be
no sex in this house.

668
00:44:35,764 --> 00:44:37,865
Lilly.

669
00:44:37,898 --> 00:44:41,903
You and or Miss Roxanne
need to chill.

670
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,441
All right.

671
00:44:46,474 --> 00:44:49,044
Balls are gonna need
an ice pack.

672
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:31,185
Lilly.

673
00:45:31,218 --> 00:45:33,155
There's someone out here.

674
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:46,502
Lilly. Lilly.

675
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,807
Lilly.

676
00:45:54,374 --> 00:45:56,477
Lilly.

677
00:46:10,457 --> 00:46:12,293
Lilly?

678
00:46:13,494 --> 00:46:15,162
Are you hungry?

679
00:46:15,195 --> 00:46:17,398
(animal growls)

680
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:20,602
Oh...
not the giblets, babe.

681
00:46:20,635 --> 00:46:22,037
You don't... You don't want...

682
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,372
(hisses)

683
00:46:26,874 --> 00:46:28,075
Ugh.

684
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,816
Uh, babe...

685
00:46:46,961 --> 00:46:50,064
(groans)

686
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:01,909
Oh, shit.

687
00:47:06,213 --> 00:47:08,048
Did you make coffee?

688
00:47:08,081 --> 00:47:11,252
No milk.

689
00:47:13,488 --> 00:47:15,991
I don't feel well.

690
00:47:16,023 --> 00:47:19,526
Morning sickness.

691
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:21,595
Oh, ha ha.

692
00:47:21,628 --> 00:47:23,931
- Maybe if you didn't keep me up all night.
- What do you mean?

693
00:47:23,965 --> 00:47:26,468
- I said no sex.
- We didn't have sex.

694
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:28,470
Well, then who was between
my legs last night?

695
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:33,408
Grew up, Ray?

696
00:47:33,441 --> 00:47:35,243
I... I didn't do that.

697
00:47:35,276 --> 00:47:37,412
Oh, of course you didn't,
because that would mean

698
00:47:37,445 --> 00:47:39,147
you're having fun.

699
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,448
I am fun5.

700
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:42,316
I'm going to shower.

701
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:44,619
You've no sense of humor.

702
00:47:47,287 --> 00:47:51,659
I'm fun. Try me.

703
00:47:51,693 --> 00:47:54,428
Tell me I'm not fun.
You're not fun.

704
00:47:56,064 --> 00:47:57,432
I'm a lot of fun.

705
00:47:57,465 --> 00:48:00,635
(shower running)

706
00:48:00,668 --> 00:48:02,537
We'll see if you find it
amusing when I scare the shit

707
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:04,171
out of you for once.

708
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:15,583
Boo!

709
00:48:16,684 --> 00:48:18,120
Lilly?

710
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,957
Lilly, you okay?

711
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:26,928
(speaking foreign language
in demonic voice)

712
00:48:28,528 --> 00:48:30,564
Lilly.

713
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,206
- (hisses)
- (shouts)

714
00:48:40,008 --> 00:48:42,343
Aah!
What the hell?

715
00:48:42,376 --> 00:48:45,179
(laughs)

716
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,716
Oh, I got... I got you.

717
00:48:47,749 --> 00:48:50,185
You know I hate clowns.

718
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,654
It's a clown
from outer space.

719
00:48:52,686 --> 00:48:54,488
It's not funny.

720
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:56,290
Boo. Rah!

721
00:48:56,323 --> 00:48:59,026
- I'm gonna go work.
- You're such a pussy.

722
00:49:08,735 --> 00:49:10,471
Hold on a second.

723
00:49:10,505 --> 00:49:13,508
You're telling us that the
lunar lander from Apollo 13

724
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,776
didn't burn up
in the atmosphere?

725
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:17,512
That's correct.

726
00:49:17,544 --> 00:49:20,548
And the technology was used
to travel back in time?

727
00:49:20,581 --> 00:49:23,184
Not back. Forward.

728
00:49:23,217 --> 00:49:27,488
How did the lander reach Earth
without blowing up?

729
00:49:27,521 --> 00:49:30,391
Well, the theory is

730
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,628
is that Aquarius was swept
into a time continuum,

731
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,264
a black hole
without the destruction,

732
00:49:36,296 --> 00:49:39,501
and it was recovered by
a primitive civilization.

733
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:43,338
At that point,
they were guided by outsiders

734
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:45,506
to create a machine

735
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:48,043
that could transport
to another time and place.

736
00:49:48,075 --> 00:49:50,077
Outsiders, Doc?

737
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,379
Oh, you mean like aliens?

738
00:49:52,412 --> 00:49:55,082
Wow.

739
00:49:55,115 --> 00:49:58,452
Now a word from our sponsors,
my tortured tinfoil hatters.

740
00:49:58,485 --> 00:50:03,290
"Click a seer if you want
to be seen and have a session."

741
00:50:03,323 --> 00:50:04,526
There we go.

742
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,229
Ah, nice to see you.
Come into my den.

743
00:50:09,262 --> 00:50:11,400
We will talk.

744
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,437
- Must be a Jesus sale.
- Come.

745
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:19,240
I have a special
right now just for you.

746
00:50:19,273 --> 00:50:22,077
Welcome to Mystic Mama.

747
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:25,079
- Look who it is.
- My friend,

748
00:50:25,113 --> 00:50:29,418
I see dark and stormy nights
in your future.

749
00:50:30,718 --> 00:50:33,455
You want
to change your luck?

750
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:38,426
Give me a call.
Mystic Mama at your services.

751
00:50:38,459 --> 00:50:40,227
(laughs)

752
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,775
God, that chick's freaky.

753
00:50:56,677 --> 00:51:00,148
This is the exact moment
I should not be here.

754
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,249
Shh.

755
00:51:02,282 --> 00:51:05,786
We are here to travel
across the great divide.

756
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,354
Oh, brother.

757
00:51:07,387 --> 00:51:09,823
We will travel through
the needle of time,

758
00:51:09,856 --> 00:51:12,427
space and dimension.

759
00:51:12,459 --> 00:51:16,396
It's inconceivable,
theoretically impossible.

760
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,334
Raymond,
you should join us.

761
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,503
It's Ray.
And I'm good over here.

762
00:51:21,535 --> 00:51:24,706
The power of three
is a safer energy.

763
00:51:24,738 --> 00:51:27,675
Yeah, see,
I'm the camera guy.

764
00:51:27,707 --> 00:51:28,776
Ray.

765
00:51:30,544 --> 00:51:32,914
Okay. All right, fine.

766
00:51:32,947 --> 00:51:35,517
When I have bad dreams tonight
and can't write tomorrow,

767
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,285
somebody is getting
their ass kicked.

768
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:39,419
Are you drunk?

769
00:51:39,452 --> 00:51:41,822
No. You're drunk.

770
00:51:41,856 --> 00:51:43,791
You have bad dreams?

771
00:51:43,823 --> 00:51:46,494
We have to sleep
with a nightlight on.

772
00:51:46,526 --> 00:51:47,928
I have a vivid imagination.

773
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:50,297
It makes me a better writer.

774
00:51:50,331 --> 00:51:51,432
Oh, does it?

775
00:51:51,465 --> 00:51:54,235
Sometimes I dream
with my eyes ajar

776
00:51:54,267 --> 00:51:56,271
and they
play mischief on me.

777
00:51:56,303 --> 00:51:59,307
Night light helps.
There, I said it.

778
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,811
He dreams of horned people
watching him while he sleeps.

779
00:52:03,843 --> 00:52:06,280
Why do they watch you?

780
00:52:06,314 --> 00:52:08,816
Oh, can we keep this
about Lilly please?

781
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:10,718
Her acting job.

782
00:52:10,751 --> 00:52:13,388
So we just put our fingers
on the oracle like this?

783
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,557
That is correct, Lilly.

784
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,858
Ray.

785
00:52:19,693 --> 00:52:23,564
Close your eyes,
take a deep breath,

786
00:52:23,597 --> 00:52:26,266
let go of the tension
of the day.

787
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,834
What about the tension
of the night?

788
00:52:27,867 --> 00:52:29,703
Shut the fuck up.

789
00:52:29,736 --> 00:52:31,639
Deep breathing.

790
00:52:31,671 --> 00:52:36,311
Release control as we control
nothing in this universe

791
00:52:36,343 --> 00:52:38,679
and we are but
an existential leaf

792
00:52:38,713 --> 00:52:41,448
floating in the wind
of time.

793
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:44,351
Breathe in and out.

794
00:52:47,387 --> 00:52:48,922
Ray,
why did you let go?

795
00:52:48,956 --> 00:52:51,358
- Did you move it?
- No.

796
00:52:51,392 --> 00:52:52,927
What about you, Yoga?

797
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:55,697
Raymond, it's normal
to feel awkward

798
00:52:55,729 --> 00:52:56,997
in times of enlightenment.

799
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:58,699
Did you fucking
move it or not?

800
00:52:58,733 --> 00:53:00,501
Ray, be nice.

801
00:53:00,534 --> 00:53:04,372
I can assure you the oracle
glided without my influence.

802
00:53:04,405 --> 00:53:05,573
Okay, I'm out.

803
00:53:05,606 --> 00:53:08,008
- Ray!
- No, don't "Ray" me.

804
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:10,377
I didn't sign up
for incantations

805
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:13,447
or spiritual channeling,
whatever the hell that is.

806
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,015
If you let go now,

807
00:53:15,048 --> 00:53:17,684
we may not be able
to control the portal.

808
00:53:17,718 --> 00:53:19,520
So?

809
00:53:19,552 --> 00:53:21,688
If we can't control the portal,
anything can pass through.

810
00:53:21,722 --> 00:53:23,957
Evil can make its way.

811
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:24,958
No, Ray.

812
00:53:24,992 --> 00:53:26,727
Okay, fine.

813
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,864
Can we just hurry up and
close the door or whatever.

814
00:53:30,898 --> 00:53:34,970
Put your hands on the oracle.
We will close the portal.

815
00:53:36,436 --> 00:53:37,938
Whoa, Lilly,
hands on the thing.

816
00:53:37,972 --> 00:53:39,740
Aah!

817
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:43,245
(bones cracking)

818
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:47,582
(Southern accent) You should have
thought of that before I caught you.

819
00:53:47,615 --> 00:53:48,850
Who are you?

820
00:53:48,883 --> 00:53:50,651
Who am I, witch?

821
00:53:50,684 --> 00:53:52,320
What can we do for you?

822
00:53:52,352 --> 00:53:53,755
Shut your mouth.

823
00:53:53,787 --> 00:53:55,856
This is none of your business.

824
00:53:55,889 --> 00:53:57,324
(laughs)

825
00:53:59,727 --> 00:54:01,963
Time to pay the piper.

826
00:54:01,996 --> 00:54:03,298
The what now?

827
00:54:03,331 --> 00:54:04,399
(gasps)

828
00:54:06,434 --> 00:54:10,905
Come here, boy, I'm gonna
split your skull in two.

829
00:54:10,938 --> 00:54:12,407
(bones cracking)

830
00:54:12,439 --> 00:54:13,907
(screams)

831
00:54:13,941 --> 00:54:16,843
Jesus, Lilly.
Lilly!

832
00:54:16,876 --> 00:54:19,746
Are you okay?

833
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,850
Oh...

834
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:24,451
What happened?

835
00:54:24,485 --> 00:54:26,354
You okay?

836
00:54:26,387 --> 00:54:27,488
I'm fine.

837
00:54:27,521 --> 00:54:29,390
I think
you're overdoing it.

838
00:54:29,423 --> 00:54:31,959
You're working too hard.

839
00:54:31,992 --> 00:54:34,528
Just get some rest, okay?

840
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:36,063
Our baby needs sleep.

841
00:54:36,097 --> 00:54:37,865
You're a jerk.

842
00:54:37,898 --> 00:54:39,700
I got a bit
of writing to do.

843
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:41,635
My book needs nursing.

844
00:54:41,668 --> 00:54:45,339
(sighs)
Besides, who can sleep now?

845
00:54:45,372 --> 00:54:47,941
I love you.

846
00:54:47,974 --> 00:54:51,645
"His long journey
into the wild

847
00:54:51,678 --> 00:54:53,414
would have been
all for naught

848
00:54:53,447 --> 00:54:56,784
if it wasn't for
his sole surviving wife

849
00:54:56,816 --> 00:54:59,019
and unborn child

850
00:54:59,052 --> 00:55:02,055
that carries on
in light of his stead."

851
00:55:02,088 --> 00:55:05,659
"That carry...
carry on..."

852
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:08,028
(mutters)

853
00:55:08,061 --> 00:55:10,630
"Carries on..."

854
00:55:10,664 --> 00:55:13,735
"His wife..."

855
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:16,670
"Unborn child..."

856
00:55:27,414 --> 00:55:30,517
(muttering)

857
00:55:42,796 --> 00:55:45,932
(ominous music)

858
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:50,037
(computerized voices
speaking indistinct)

859
00:56:14,928 --> 00:56:16,631
(animal growls)

860
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,568
(Lilly moans)

861
00:56:20,601 --> 00:56:22,869
Lilly, wake up!

862
00:56:22,903 --> 00:56:24,939
(Lilly moans)

863
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:43,792
I think someone's
in the house.

864
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:36,510
She's not even there.

865
00:57:36,543 --> 00:57:40,080
You can open your eyes.
No one's going to be there.

866
00:57:40,113 --> 00:57:42,916
You're just gonna go to bed.

867
00:57:51,124 --> 00:57:54,161
My love,
the moon and stars.

868
00:58:01,135 --> 00:58:05,106
(demonic voice)
You will surrender your seed.

869
00:58:10,677 --> 00:58:13,180
You will surrender
your seed.

870
00:58:15,081 --> 00:58:16,583
(animal growls)

871
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,332
Camera man:
Damn, she's super hot.

872
00:58:32,365 --> 00:58:34,034
Chaz:
Mm-hmm.

873
00:58:34,068 --> 00:58:36,270
Hey, yo, by the way, that
hidden camera statue thing,

874
00:58:36,302 --> 00:58:37,904
that shit's dope.

875
00:58:37,938 --> 00:58:40,073
For real. Well done.
Where'd you get that shit?

876
00:58:40,106 --> 00:58:41,742
Oh, my girl got it
from a flea market.

877
00:58:41,775 --> 00:58:44,711
Hmm. Word.

878
00:58:44,744 --> 00:58:48,281
It's, like, some weird, like,
indigenous shit, huh?

879
00:58:48,314 --> 00:58:50,217
What'd I miss?

880
00:58:50,249 --> 00:58:52,186
Where's my candy?

881
00:58:52,218 --> 00:58:54,220
- Tony "C" says hi.
- Mm.

882
00:58:54,253 --> 00:58:55,989
Did you tell him
what the camera can do?

883
00:58:56,023 --> 00:58:58,325
Oh, yeah,
so it's motion activated.

884
00:58:58,358 --> 00:58:59,994
It tilts. It pans.

885
00:59:00,026 --> 00:59:02,796
Both:
It can even zoom.

886
00:59:02,829 --> 00:59:05,065
Yo, whatever the fuck that is,

887
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:06,834
that need to stop right now.

888
00:59:06,867 --> 00:59:08,702
Both:
Okay.

889
00:59:16,776 --> 00:59:19,046
See if we can't find
our superstar.

890
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:24,785
(urinating)

891
00:59:25,952 --> 00:59:27,188
(gasps)
Get out!

892
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,090
Can I have
some privacy please?

893
00:59:29,122 --> 00:59:31,224
You told me
to record everything.

894
00:59:31,258 --> 00:59:32,660
Get out!

895
00:59:32,693 --> 00:59:35,597
Okay.

896
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,135
Lilly on computer:
So, guys, I'm off to the Con.

897
00:59:42,168 --> 00:59:45,772
Don't forget to get your tees
and your selfies

898
00:59:45,805 --> 00:59:47,941
with your favorite
Box Girl Lilly

899
00:59:47,974 --> 00:59:51,044
at booth 323.

900
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,216
(exhales)
Okay. Here we go.

901
01:00:03,956 --> 01:00:06,092
Yeah! Oh, my God.

902
01:00:06,126 --> 01:00:08,196
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

903
01:00:13,332 --> 01:00:16,169
Okay.
What are you doing?

904
01:00:16,202 --> 01:00:17,771
What does it look like
I'm doing?

905
01:00:17,805 --> 01:00:20,007
And you call me
the crazy one.

906
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:21,875
What?
You back to normal now?

907
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,943
What the hell
are you talking about?

908
01:00:23,977 --> 01:00:25,312
Really?

909
01:00:25,345 --> 01:00:26,714
Look, I've got
character work to do,

910
01:00:26,747 --> 01:00:28,182
so kill your bugs.

911
01:00:28,215 --> 01:00:30,217
Especially the ones
inside your head.

912
01:00:30,249 --> 01:00:33,153
And please have the camera
ready to roll in ten minutes.

913
01:00:33,186 --> 01:00:34,320
Mm-mm. I'm done.

914
01:00:34,354 --> 01:00:35,689
What?

915
01:00:35,722 --> 01:00:37,724
I can't do it anymore.

916
01:00:37,758 --> 01:00:39,326
My followers are coming back,
Ray.

917
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:41,394
They're responding
to my content.

918
01:00:41,427 --> 01:00:43,863
No.
All this social media stuff,

919
01:00:43,896 --> 01:00:47,034
whatever,
it's making you crazy, okay?

920
01:00:47,066 --> 01:00:48,735
And I'm not gonna be
a part of it anymore.

921
01:00:48,769 --> 01:00:51,906
My director says that
this could be my big break.

922
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,310
Please.

923
01:00:58,111 --> 01:00:59,414
Okay.

924
01:01:08,521 --> 01:01:10,724
Dr. Ulrich:
They were guided by outsiders

925
01:01:10,758 --> 01:01:12,793
to create a machine

926
01:01:12,825 --> 01:01:15,028
that could transport
to another time and place.

927
01:01:15,061 --> 01:01:17,997
Juice: I always wanted
to travel back in time.

928
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,067
But this future
doesn't look so bright.

929
01:01:22,436 --> 01:01:25,472
Dr. Ulrich: The cost of traveling
from one dimension to another

930
01:01:25,506 --> 01:01:27,508
comes at a price.

931
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:29,343
Juice:
Like a blood sacrifice.

932
01:01:29,376 --> 01:01:33,447
Well, glyphs indicate
that only their death

933
01:01:33,479 --> 01:01:35,515
allows a rebirth.

934
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:38,451
Juice: You hear that,
paranormalists?

935
01:01:38,485 --> 01:01:41,088
Rebirth.

936
01:01:50,963 --> 01:01:53,366
(static)

937
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:43,117
(thunder rumbling)

938
01:02:51,525 --> 01:02:54,528
(baby crying)

939
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:37,404
Aah!

940
01:04:16,276 --> 01:04:17,611
I don't know
what the hell happened.

941
01:04:17,644 --> 01:04:21,180
I was writing
and the juices were flowing,

942
01:04:21,213 --> 01:04:23,182
and the next thing I remember,

943
01:04:23,215 --> 01:04:26,621
I wake up on the floor.

944
01:04:38,664 --> 01:04:41,235
Is this thing
really necessary?

945
01:04:42,702 --> 01:04:44,271
It's to catch bad dreams.

946
01:04:44,303 --> 01:04:46,372
It's for your protection.

947
01:04:46,405 --> 01:04:49,175
Carrying the statue
to the bathroom with you now?

948
01:04:49,209 --> 01:04:51,078
That's what we're doing?

949
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:52,645
It's my inspiration, Ray.

950
01:04:52,678 --> 01:04:56,282
Well, speaking of inspiration,

951
01:04:56,316 --> 01:04:58,352
I got some pages done.

952
01:04:58,385 --> 01:05:00,387
- You wanna read 'em?
- Not now.

953
01:05:00,419 --> 01:05:03,389
I see. So it's okay
for you to be creative,

954
01:05:03,423 --> 01:05:05,592
but as soon as I wanna show you
some of my stuff, it's...

955
01:05:05,624 --> 01:05:07,460
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

956
01:05:07,494 --> 01:05:09,196
What's going on? Hey.

957
01:05:09,229 --> 01:05:11,497
Hey.

958
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:13,967
What's up?
What's happening?

959
01:05:14,001 --> 01:05:16,169
(sniffs)
I'm losing fans.

960
01:05:16,202 --> 01:05:18,671
They're gonna
demonetize my site.

961
01:05:18,704 --> 01:05:20,506
And I'm gonna be cut
from the cast.

962
01:05:20,539 --> 01:05:22,642
No. Babe, no. Hey.

963
01:05:22,675 --> 01:05:25,111
You're doing great.
You're amazing.

964
01:05:25,144 --> 01:05:26,546
No. Baby.

965
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:29,449
Now, look, don't worry
about reading my stuff.

966
01:05:29,483 --> 01:05:31,685
You can read it whenever.

967
01:05:31,718 --> 01:05:33,654
I'm sure it's good.

968
01:05:33,686 --> 01:05:36,622
Thanks.

969
01:05:36,655 --> 01:05:39,258
I need you
to film everything, Ray.

970
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:41,060
I mean, no matter what.

971
01:05:41,093 --> 01:05:42,628
I need you
to keep the camera rolling.

972
01:05:42,662 --> 01:05:46,200
Okay... Hey, I'll...
I'll film everything.

973
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:49,602
- Everything?
- Yeah. I promise.

974
01:05:49,635 --> 01:05:51,204
Okay?

975
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:54,308
But you gotta
keep me out of it.

976
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:57,277
All right?
Just the camera guy.

977
01:05:59,445 --> 01:06:01,514
Great, because, well,

978
01:06:01,548 --> 01:06:03,517
Angela's coming tomorrow
for another session,

979
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:06,287
so make sure the camera's
fully charged.

980
01:06:10,356 --> 01:06:12,625
Angela.

981
01:06:12,659 --> 01:06:15,095
Fantastic.

982
01:06:15,128 --> 01:06:18,365
May the darkest journeys
turn bright.

983
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,702
Cannot believe I let you
talk me into this again.

984
01:06:25,572 --> 01:06:28,342
Oh, my God.
It tastes like fecal matter.

985
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:33,046
We would like to give thanks

986
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:35,415
for this special night.

987
01:06:35,448 --> 01:06:38,519
We open our arms
to the mystics.

988
01:06:38,552 --> 01:06:41,722
We open our arms
to the unknown.

989
01:06:41,755 --> 01:06:44,791
We open our hearts
freely to contact you,

990
01:06:44,825 --> 01:06:50,497
the all-present, everywhere
spirit of the night.

991
01:06:58,204 --> 01:07:01,141
Spirit, who do you seek?

992
01:07:02,175 --> 01:07:06,814
R... A... Y.

993
01:07:06,847 --> 01:07:08,482
Okay.

994
01:07:08,514 --> 01:07:10,383
Ray, it wants you.

995
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:13,420
Yeah, well, tell whoever it is
Ray's not home.

996
01:07:17,256 --> 01:07:19,092
(hisses)

997
01:07:20,392 --> 01:07:21,494
(groans)

998
01:07:24,898 --> 01:07:27,700
(screaming, bones cracking)

999
01:07:27,733 --> 01:07:29,769
(Southern accent)
Get inside my gut, Ray.

1000
01:07:29,802 --> 01:07:31,404
What is your name, spirit?

1001
01:07:31,438 --> 01:07:33,173
Silence.

1002
01:07:35,307 --> 01:07:36,709
Come here, boy.

1003
01:07:36,742 --> 01:07:38,411
Babe, I love you,

1004
01:07:38,445 --> 01:07:39,746
but you're really
freaking me out right now.

1005
01:07:39,778 --> 01:07:41,581
Maybe I can help.

1006
01:07:41,615 --> 01:07:44,251
What is it that you want
from Ray?

1007
01:07:49,456 --> 01:07:51,258
(cracks neck)

1008
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:53,861
Okay. All right. Look, babe,
you're taking this method shit

1009
01:07:53,894 --> 01:07:55,395
way too far.

1010
01:07:55,427 --> 01:07:57,530
Shut your mouth, cunt.

1011
01:07:57,564 --> 01:08:00,734
You're the blackwater leech
that feeds off people

1012
01:08:00,767 --> 01:08:04,138
without a memory of doing so.

1013
01:08:04,171 --> 01:08:06,840
And he finished
his Earthly...

1014
01:08:06,872 --> 01:08:09,642
with an ungrateful
swig of content.

1015
01:08:09,675 --> 01:08:11,811
Ow! Lilly, what the hell?

1016
01:08:11,845 --> 01:08:14,481
Hell? Not exactly, boy.

1017
01:08:14,514 --> 01:08:16,150
That really hurt.

1018
01:08:16,183 --> 01:08:18,152
Could you please stop
slapping me?

1019
01:08:18,184 --> 01:08:19,452
(groans)

1020
01:08:19,486 --> 01:08:21,421
You like being slapped,
don't you, clown?

1021
01:08:21,454 --> 01:08:23,456
No, I don't like
being smacked.

1022
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:27,661
Yeehaw! I think
the catfish likes it.

1023
01:08:27,693 --> 01:08:29,463
You like it,
bottom feeder?

1024
01:08:29,495 --> 01:08:30,830
(bones crack)

1025
01:08:30,863 --> 01:08:35,768
(screams)

1026
01:08:35,802 --> 01:08:37,504
(normal voice)
Ray... Ray...

1027
01:08:37,536 --> 01:08:41,507
Who's that bitch trying
to get inside my God dang...

1028
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,942
(bones crack)

1029
01:08:42,976 --> 01:08:47,380
Ray.

1030
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:50,884
Ray. Ray...

1031
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:54,388
(grunts)

1032
01:08:56,255 --> 01:08:58,791
Lilly. Lilly.

1033
01:08:58,825 --> 01:09:00,861
Angela, help!

1034
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:08,268
(snarls)

1035
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,838
(screams)

1036
01:09:13,005 --> 01:09:15,543
(laughing)

1037
01:09:19,745 --> 01:09:21,681
(roaring)

1038
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:25,384
Ray.

1039
01:09:25,418 --> 01:09:29,356
Ray,
I want to eat your heart.

1040
01:09:29,388 --> 01:09:30,924
(laughs)

1041
01:09:34,361 --> 01:09:36,397
Lilly:
Ray...

1042
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:39,233
Ray...

1043
01:10:18,705 --> 01:10:20,341
Lilly?

1044
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:24,245
Angela?

1045
01:11:03,883 --> 01:11:05,519
Just close your eyes.

1046
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:08,854
Open them, and you're
gonna be back in bed.

1047
01:11:08,888 --> 01:11:11,992
(laughs)

1048
01:11:17,062 --> 01:11:18,964
Just close your eyes,

1049
01:11:18,997 --> 01:11:20,467
and when you open them,

1050
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,404
you're gonna be back in bed.

1051
01:11:36,383 --> 01:11:39,920
(wood knocking, clattering)

1052
01:11:43,822 --> 01:11:46,360
You feel that?

1053
01:11:47,727 --> 01:11:49,963
Aah!

1054
01:11:52,064 --> 01:11:54,534
Aah!

1055
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:56,136
(knocking continues)

1056
01:11:56,169 --> 01:11:58,572
Oh, God.

1057
01:11:58,604 --> 01:12:01,442
Aah!

1058
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:18,657
It's not there.
It's not there. It's not there.

1059
01:12:18,691 --> 01:12:21,128
It's not there.

1060
01:12:22,762 --> 01:12:24,997
It's not...

1061
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:36,409
(cracking)

1062
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:40,646
(animal growls)

1063
01:12:43,482 --> 01:12:46,452
(cracking)

1064
01:12:49,522 --> 01:12:51,525
(gasps)

1065
01:13:05,472 --> 01:13:07,674
Why you leaving it there?

1066
01:13:10,043 --> 01:13:12,512
Well, good morning.

1067
01:13:12,545 --> 01:13:15,015
How you feel?
'Cause I feel like shit.

1068
01:13:16,883 --> 01:13:18,485
Would have been nice to know

1069
01:13:18,518 --> 01:13:20,888
that we were gonna trip
on cosmic tea last night.

1070
01:13:24,656 --> 01:13:27,494
What, nothing?

1071
01:13:27,527 --> 01:13:30,163
You just get to drug me
with some strange woman

1072
01:13:30,196 --> 01:13:33,434
and I'm supposed to be
okay with this shit?

1073
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:39,573
Something's been
going on here too,

1074
01:13:39,606 --> 01:13:40,773
and don't tell me
I'm dreaming.

1075
01:13:40,807 --> 01:13:42,142
I'm not dreaming.

1076
01:13:42,174 --> 01:13:43,943
Got these bites
all over my back.

1077
01:13:43,977 --> 01:13:46,713
Shit's itchy as hell.

1078
01:13:47,813 --> 01:13:50,584
You know, every time you start
to do this method acting shit,

1079
01:13:50,616 --> 01:13:52,918
you get all bipolar
and crazy on me.

1080
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:54,920
I don't appreciate it.

1081
01:13:54,954 --> 01:13:58,558
There is a long list
predating the pyramids.

1082
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:00,927
Dr. Ulrich:
And I'm not talking Egypt.

1083
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,262
Juice: You're talking
south of the border.

1084
01:14:02,295 --> 01:14:04,498
You know, there's evidence
to suggest that...

1085
01:14:04,531 --> 01:14:05,899
that time and space travel

1086
01:14:05,932 --> 01:14:08,001
had been integrated
into the spirit world.

1087
01:14:08,034 --> 01:14:09,969
Juice: You hear that,
paranormalists?

1088
01:14:10,003 --> 01:14:13,674
Aliens and ghosts
travel in time.

1089
01:14:16,543 --> 01:14:18,512
(ominous music)

1090
01:14:29,789 --> 01:14:31,858
Hey, babe.

1091
01:14:40,599 --> 01:14:43,669
Need any organs lately?

1092
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:49,543
Some wild stuff today.

1093
01:14:52,911 --> 01:14:54,280
Think you got this charac...

1094
01:14:54,313 --> 01:14:56,983
Oh, characters, down.

1095
01:15:00,987 --> 01:15:03,257
You're amazing.
You know that?

1096
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:09,795
I know... I know it's been
a crazy week, but...

1097
01:15:09,829 --> 01:15:12,799
I just wanna let you know
that I'm proud of you.

1098
01:15:16,603 --> 01:15:20,040
Well, goodnight,
whoever you are.

1099
01:15:29,048 --> 01:15:31,285
(ominous music)

1100
01:15:33,786 --> 01:15:36,924
(papers rustling)

1101
01:15:42,295 --> 01:15:44,865
(Ray sighs)

1102
01:16:04,651 --> 01:16:07,354
You're all a bunch of assholes.
You know that?

1103
01:16:08,854 --> 01:16:12,992
Mm. Yeah, Lilly bird.

1104
01:16:14,192 --> 01:16:15,128
(phone rings)

1105
01:16:15,161 --> 01:16:17,931
Hey, Lilly?

1106
01:16:17,964 --> 01:16:19,866
Think your director's calling.

1107
01:16:19,898 --> 01:16:21,334
(ringing continues)

1108
01:16:21,366 --> 01:16:22,735
Roxanne?

1109
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:26,640
Babe, you want me
to draw you a bath?

1110
01:16:26,673 --> 01:16:28,308
Maybe it'll make you
feel better?

1111
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:31,378
(speaking indistinct)

1112
01:16:31,411 --> 01:16:33,747
- Mm.
- No.

1113
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,348
I'm just gonna put it over there
so it doesn't get wet.

1114
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:36,950
- (hisses)
- Oh. Oh. Okay.

1115
01:16:36,982 --> 01:16:38,884
I'm just gonna put it
right there

1116
01:16:38,918 --> 01:16:40,186
so it doesn't get wet,
okay?

1117
01:16:40,219 --> 01:16:42,723
Come here.

1118
01:16:45,223 --> 01:16:48,260
There. See? It's fine.
It's fine.

1119
01:16:48,294 --> 01:16:51,764
It's okay. Here, let's get in.
Let's get you in.

1120
01:16:54,834 --> 01:16:57,070
Okay.
Let's get in.

1121
01:17:09,014 --> 01:17:10,983
(phone rings)

1122
01:17:11,017 --> 01:17:12,352
(beeps)

1123
01:17:12,384 --> 01:17:13,887
Yeah.

1124
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,924
What up, Raymond?
(laughs)

1125
01:17:17,956 --> 01:17:19,325
How's it hangin', brah?

1126
01:17:19,357 --> 01:17:21,760
You're watching, aren't you?
She won't talk.

1127
01:17:21,794 --> 01:17:24,363
Just want to say aces
with the camera work, son.

1128
01:17:24,397 --> 01:17:25,999
Look, tell me something.

1129
01:17:26,031 --> 01:17:29,201
Have you noticed anything...
odd with Lilly?

1130
01:17:29,235 --> 01:17:30,903
What you talking about,
Willis?

1131
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:33,872
Like, she won't go anywhere
without that damn statue.

1132
01:17:33,906 --> 01:17:36,209
Yo, you being kind of
aggressive and shit, Ray.

1133
01:17:36,241 --> 01:17:38,410
Okay. Yeah...
Have you seen any footage

1134
01:17:38,443 --> 01:17:40,245
that's out of the ordinary?

1135
01:17:40,278 --> 01:17:42,214
A phantasm.

1136
01:17:42,247 --> 01:17:45,250
A demon.
(laughs)

1137
01:17:45,284 --> 01:17:47,320
Demon?
Why would you say that?

1138
01:17:48,888 --> 01:17:51,457
(water dripping)

1139
01:18:04,103 --> 01:18:08,775
Okay. Something that's...
possessing her.

1140
01:18:21,787 --> 01:18:24,991
(bones cracking)

1141
01:18:27,259 --> 01:18:31,330
I ain't seen nothin'
beyond paranormal, brah.

1142
01:18:36,335 --> 01:18:40,939
Yo, Lilly bird is okay.
It's you who we worried about.

1143
01:18:40,973 --> 01:18:43,076
(man speaks
on Walkie Talkie indistinct)

1144
01:18:44,509 --> 01:18:47,213
Yeah, I'll be there
in a minute, a'ight?

1145
01:18:47,245 --> 01:18:48,947
Mm.

1146
01:18:48,981 --> 01:18:48,979
Yo, Ray, I
with you, brah.

1147
01:18:48,981 --> 01:18:50,983
otta be honest

1148
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:52,852
We in preproduction hell
right now.

1149
01:18:52,884 --> 01:18:54,887
Like, agents be callin' me
and shit,

1150
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,555
wanting their clients
to be paid more.

1151
01:18:56,589 --> 01:18:58,424
We ain't got the money.
You know what I'm saying?

1152
01:18:58,456 --> 01:18:59,992
The shit's Hollywood.
You feel me?

1153
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:02,996
Ray, I ain't even seen
the footage myself.

1154
01:19:03,028 --> 01:19:04,129
<i>(Ray moans)</i>

1155
01:19:04,162 --> 01:19:06,331
You haven't watched any...
Great.

1156
01:19:06,365 --> 01:19:08,101
<i>Babe,
how do I shut it off?</i>

1157
01:19:08,134 --> 01:19:09,469
Could you please just let me
know if you see something?

1158
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:12,104
I'm really...
I'm really worried about her.

1159
01:19:12,138 --> 01:19:13,872
I gotta fly, Ray. Peace.

1160
01:19:13,906 --> 01:19:15,175
(computer beeps)

1161
01:19:15,207 --> 01:19:16,543
You're a dickhead, bro.

1162
01:19:16,576 --> 01:19:21,448
Y-O-U apostrophe R-E
a dickhead.

1163
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:26,920
(gasps)

1164
01:19:38,063 --> 01:19:42,235
You would not believe what
a douchebag your director is.

1165
01:19:43,469 --> 01:19:44,838
Lilly.

1166
01:19:51,643 --> 01:19:54,046
(sighs)

1167
01:19:59,018 --> 01:20:01,087
"In order to travel,
they would sacrifice

1168
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:07,026
a being of one world to take
the host of another world."

1169
01:20:07,058 --> 01:20:13,866
"The Sun and Moon Goddess
is a traveler of space and time.

1170
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:17,135
She prays upon
the weak and desperate.

1171
01:20:17,169 --> 01:20:20,305
She occupies vessels

1172
01:20:20,339 --> 01:20:23,109
with her enslaved warrior.

1173
01:20:23,142 --> 01:20:27,313
They impregnate their way
into the lives of their victims

1174
01:20:27,345 --> 01:20:30,282
through pleasure and pain."

1175
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:35,021
"It's their only way
to survive,

01:20:35,054 --> 01:20:37,891
travel of time and space."

1177
01:20:37,924 --> 01:20:42,963
"The warrior takes a direct
approach to his female victims."

1178
01:20:44,629 --> 01:20:49,101
"The Serpent Goddess first
inseminates her praised soul

1179
01:20:49,134 --> 01:20:51,237
with her life force."

1180
01:20:53,973 --> 01:20:58,144
"She then
devours their hearts...

1181
01:20:58,177 --> 01:21:00,280
for a strong offspring.

1182
01:21:00,312 --> 01:21:06,051
After consummation,
she sometimes removes the host's skull

1183
01:21:06,085 --> 01:21:09,589
as a souvenir."

1184
01:21:09,621 --> 01:21:12,325
Jesus. Why?
Why are you reading this?

1185
01:21:12,357 --> 01:21:14,459
What are you doing?

1186
01:21:14,492 --> 01:21:17,463
(crickets chirping)

(breathing heavily)

1188
01:22:09,682 --> 01:22:12,552
Did you see that?

1189
01:22:14,353 --> 01:22:16,756
Oh...

1190
01:22:16,789 --> 01:22:20,326
Okay.

1191
01:22:20,358 --> 01:22:24,162
Oh, I like that.
Don't stop.

1192
01:22:24,196 --> 01:22:26,399
Lilly:
Oh, hey.

1193
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:29,068
(moans)

1194

- (moaning)

1195
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:35,675
Lilly: Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Harder.

1196
01:22:35,707 --> 01:22:37,710
(moaning loudly)

1197
01:22:37,742 --> 01:22:39,711
Oh, yeah.

1198
01:22:39,745 --> 01:22:43,215
No, wait. Don't stop.

1199
01:22:43,249 --> 01:22:46,085
Oh, don't stop.
Where are you going?

1200
01:22:46,117 --> 01:22:49,354
Oh, come back.

1201
01:22:49,388 --> 01:22:51,491
- (laughs)
- Oh, yeah.

1202
01:22:51,523 --> 01:22:53,425
- Wait. No, wait.
- (animal growls)

1203
01:22:53,459 --> 01:22:56,162
That doesn't feel good.
No, that doesn't feel good.

1204
01:22:56,195 --> 01:23:00,265
- (laughter continues)
- Stop!

1205
01:23:00,299 --> 01:23:02,035
(gagging)

1206
01:23:02,067 --> 01:23:03,802
Hey, Lilly, Lilly, Lilly.
Are you okay?

01:23:03,835 --> 01:23:07,472

Ray: Lilly!
Lilly, Lilly! Lilly...

1209
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:12,644
Wake up!
Lilly, wake up! Wake up!

1210
01:23:12,678 --> 01:23:14,647
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
Look, it's me.

1211
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:16,214
- It's me. It's just Ray.
- Don't touch me!

1212
01:23:16,247 --> 01:23:18,384
It's just Ray.
It's just Ray. It's okay.

1213
01:23:18,416 --> 01:23:19,718
Hey, wake up.
Wake up. Come on.

1214
01:23:19,751 --> 01:23:22,120
Tell him to stop, Ray.
Tell him to stop.

1215
01:23:22,153 --> 01:23:23,522
It's okay.
No, it's over. It's okay.

1216
01:23:23,555 --> 01:23:26,659
It's okay. It's all right.
It's just a dream.

1217
01:23:26,692 --> 01:23:28,194
You were just dreaming.
It's okay.

1218
01:23:28,227 --> 01:23:30,530
Ray, it's not okay.

1219
01:23:30,562 --> 01:23:32,397
It's okay.

1220
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:34,666
(gasps)
They're after me.

1221
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:37,403
What's after you?

1222
01:23:37,436 --> 01:23:39,171
They're after us.

1223
01:23:39,205 --> 01:23:40,606
Who?

1224
01:23:40,638 --> 01:23:41,807
(whimpers)

1225
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,477
Baby, it's okay. Hey.

1226
01:24:07,465 --> 01:24:10,436
What?

1227
01:24:10,469 --> 01:24:11,771
Damn it!

1228
01:24:11,804 --> 01:24:13,673
(screams)

1229
01:24:13,705 --> 01:24:15,275
(laughs)

1230
01:24:16,608 --> 01:24:18,311
- Lilly: Damn it!
- Maybe you're going too far.

1231
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:21,581
Bitch, great things happen
when you hit rock bottom.

1232
01:24:21,613 --> 01:24:23,281
You Kubricked
the shit out of her.

1233
01:24:23,314 --> 01:24:24,784
Ugh!

1234
01:24:24,817 --> 01:24:26,419
You're not worried?

1235
01:24:26,451 --> 01:24:28,521
A desperate artist
is a hungry artist.

1236
01:24:28,554 --> 01:24:31,224
A hungry artist
works harder, yo.

1237
01:24:31,256 --> 01:24:32,759
- Word.
- (laughs)

1238
01:24:42,268 --> 01:24:44,270
That girl's a fuckin' earner.

1239
01:24:44,303 --> 01:24:45,571
You gonna be famous, Chaz.

1240
01:24:45,603 --> 01:24:48,407
(laughs)

1241
01:24:50,175 --> 01:24:53,245
(Ray groans softly)

1242
01:24:53,278 --> 01:24:55,781
Lilly?

1243
01:24:55,813 --> 01:24:58,217
Lilly, will you please
come look at this please?

1244
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:02,755
Look, babe, I thought
it was bug bites...

1245
01:25:02,787 --> 01:25:05,758
Ugh.

1246
01:25:12,531 --> 01:25:16,336
(doorbell rings)

1247
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:36,455
- Hmm.
- You want some?

1248
01:25:36,487 --> 01:25:37,756
Angela:
I'm fine.

1249
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:40,760
All right, suit yourself.

1250
01:25:41,559 --> 01:25:45,231
On the phone, you said
he has not been herself.

1251
01:25:45,263 --> 01:25:47,933
Yeah. I don't... yeah, ever...
ever since she's been meditating

1252
01:25:47,967 --> 01:25:49,669
with that stupid statue.

1253
01:25:49,701 --> 01:25:53,205
This statue
is the God of Fertility.

1254
01:25:53,238 --> 01:25:56,875
Fertility. No, no, the internet said
it was the God of, uh, Space Travel.

1255
01:25:56,909 --> 01:25:58,777
But not in the sense
that you think.

1256
01:25:58,811 --> 01:26:02,814
It is the exploration
of traveling one's being

1257
01:26:02,848 --> 01:26:05,885
into another
between time and space.

1258
01:26:05,918 --> 01:26:08,888
Angela: As if you were
being born into another.

1259
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:13,391
Then the traveler impregnates
their soul's energy

1260
01:26:13,424 --> 01:26:14,960
into the vessel.

1261
01:26:14,994 --> 01:26:18,764
- The vessel.
- The person.

1262
01:26:18,796 --> 01:26:20,566
B-But what happens
to the person then?

1263
01:26:20,598 --> 01:26:23,735
- Their life force is expunged.
- Expunged?

1264
01:26:23,768 --> 01:26:26,472
However, it takes a while
before complete reproduction.

1265
01:26:26,504 --> 01:26:28,340
What do you mean, takes...
So how long?

1266
01:26:28,374 --> 01:26:31,978
It depends on the will
and the openness of the host.

1267
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:34,513
There's gotta be a way...
Like, is there a way to stop it?

1268
01:26:34,545 --> 01:26:37,282
At any moment,
the surrogate's totality

1269
01:26:37,316 --> 01:26:40,253
can reverse
the transposition or possession.

1270
01:26:40,286 --> 01:26:41,921
Okay. Come again?

1271
01:26:41,954 --> 01:26:43,723
It can be stopped
at any time.

1272
01:26:43,755 --> 01:26:45,557
Okay, then, yeah, stop it.

1273
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:46,791
I cannot.

1274
01:26:46,825 --> 01:26:48,294
Well, why the fuck not?

1275
01:26:48,326 --> 01:26:51,496
It's up to the person
closest to her.

1276
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:53,331
So I... Okay, great.

1277
01:26:53,365 --> 01:26:54,867
So what can I do
to stop it?

1278
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,003
Do normal things.

1279
01:26:57,036 --> 01:26:59,939
Alter her path
back to commonality.

1280
01:26:59,972 --> 01:27:03,442
Then once the person
refutes the foreign entity,

1281
01:27:03,474 --> 01:27:06,445
it can go back
to a normal life.

1282
01:27:06,478 --> 01:27:08,481
Okay.

1283
01:27:08,513 --> 01:27:12,484
However, most are mentally too
forgone to make the distinction

1284
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:14,620
unless it's from
an outside force.

1285
01:27:14,652 --> 01:27:18,456
Outside force?

1286
01:27:18,490 --> 01:27:20,860
You, my friend.

1287
01:27:23,728 --> 01:27:25,664
Right.

1288
01:27:25,697 --> 01:27:29,067
Made your favorite.

1289
01:27:29,101 --> 01:27:31,937
You know I'm not very good
in the kitchen,

1290
01:27:31,969 --> 01:27:35,874
but I followed your recipe,
so hope it's okay.

1291
01:27:39,644 --> 01:27:41,781
Did you try the... wine?

1292
01:27:41,813 --> 01:27:43,782
Well...

1293
01:27:45,651 --> 01:27:49,455
Come on, babe.
Your fans are watching.

1294
01:27:49,487 --> 01:27:52,025
You gotta eat something.

1295
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:58,865
You know, you're always
trying to get in my pants.

1296
01:28:00,665 --> 01:28:03,503
Well, now's your chance.

1297
01:28:07,705 --> 01:28:10,008
Who's in there?

1298
01:28:12,143 --> 01:28:14,746
Is it Miss Roxanne?

1299
01:28:16,682 --> 01:28:19,485
Huh?

1300
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:25,624
Ow. Ow.

1301
01:28:30,429 --> 01:28:32,332
Hope you guys
enjoyed that one.

1302
01:28:41,005 --> 01:28:43,041
I got so carried away
the other night.

1303
01:28:43,075 --> 01:28:45,010
It was all for theater.

1304
01:28:45,043 --> 01:28:47,079
And the fans.
(whispers) And the fans.

1305
01:28:47,112 --> 01:28:49,749
No doubt.
How's social media treating you?

1306
01:28:49,781 --> 01:28:52,784
Like the mob that kills if they
don't get what they want.

1307
01:28:52,817 --> 01:28:54,452
That seance was the bomb.

1308
01:28:54,486 --> 01:28:55,787
I'm getting killer fans.

1309
01:28:55,821 --> 01:28:57,957
Well, at least one of us
will get the bonus.

1310
01:28:57,990 --> 01:29:01,994
And that chair and table trick
worked perfectly.

1311
01:29:02,027 --> 01:29:03,963
I know!

1312
01:29:03,995 --> 01:29:08,400
All we have to do is stick
these furniture pads on.

1313
01:29:10,501 --> 01:29:12,138
Aah!
Amazeballs.

1314
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:14,072
(cracking)

1315
01:29:14,106 --> 01:29:16,742
Ooh, that's gross.

1316
01:29:16,775 --> 01:29:20,646
Sound is a powerful tool.

1317
01:29:20,679 --> 01:29:22,982
To fool.
(laughs)

1318
01:29:23,014 --> 01:29:24,916
- How much time do we have?
- Two hours.

1319
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:26,818
Ooh.

1320
01:29:26,852 --> 01:29:29,522
So during the seance I want you
to scare the hell out of him.

1321
01:29:29,554 --> 01:29:31,089
Yes.

1322
01:29:31,122 --> 01:29:33,726
You're gonna grab one
of these fizzy tablets,

1323
01:29:33,759 --> 01:29:36,028
bend over,
pop it in your mouth,

1324
01:29:36,061 --> 01:29:38,430
let the fizz do the work.

1325
01:29:38,464 --> 01:29:40,666
Oh, that was so fun.

1326
01:29:40,698 --> 01:29:42,668
I know.

1327
01:29:42,701 --> 01:29:45,671
I think we went a little far
with the psychedelic tea.

1328
01:29:45,704 --> 01:29:47,872
Eh, whatever.
Ray will get over it.

1329
01:29:47,906 --> 01:29:49,175
He's a little paranoid.

1330
01:30:02,653 --> 01:30:04,756
This shit's gotta stop.

1331
01:30:06,258 --> 01:30:07,827
You need to get
the heck out of here

1332
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:11,796
and leave Lilly alone.

1333
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:14,500
Understand each other?

1334
01:30:18,036 --> 01:30:20,105
Good.

1335
01:30:20,138 --> 01:30:22,742
(distant thud)

1336
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:27,146
(camera beeps)

1337
01:30:34,186 --> 01:30:36,555
(static on computer)

1338
01:30:45,062 --> 01:30:47,866
Oh, girl, those
stacked cups and plates?

1339
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,169
That was an accident
waiting to happen.

1340
01:30:50,201 --> 01:30:51,903
Uh, what stacked cups
and plates?

1341
01:30:51,937 --> 01:30:55,841
Oh, shit.
Here he comes.

1342
01:30:55,874 --> 01:30:56,976
Hello?

1343
01:31:03,615 --> 01:31:06,686
(ominous music)

1344
01:31:17,795 --> 01:31:19,564
Hey, were you
talking to someone?

1345
01:31:19,598 --> 01:31:21,934
I thought I heard voices.

1346
01:31:21,967 --> 01:31:24,068
Hearing drums, too.

1347
01:31:24,102 --> 01:31:26,973
Here, you should drink
some water.

1348
01:31:30,008 --> 01:31:32,845
Damn it.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

1349
01:31:32,878 --> 01:31:35,281
Hold on.

1350
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,135
I swore I heard somebody.

1351
01:31:57,169 --> 01:31:59,939
I'm not going crazy.

1352
01:32:01,607 --> 01:32:04,877
Maybe I am going crazy.

1353
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:07,880
(Lilly crying)

1354
01:32:07,912 --> 01:32:11,616
Oh, babe. Oh.
Hey, don't cry.

1355
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:14,186
Hey.
You're gonna be great.

1356
01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:16,221
And you're gonna get
so many fans from this.

1357
01:32:16,254 --> 01:32:19,258
And, you know, your director's
really lucky to have you.

1358
01:32:19,290 --> 01:32:21,326
- (laughs, cries)
- Okay?

1359
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:24,228
- Mm-hmm.
- You just... You just get some sleep.

1360
01:32:24,262 --> 01:32:28,701
I think... we all just need
to get some sleep.

1361
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:36,641
I'm losing my mind.

1362
01:32:36,674 --> 01:32:38,309
(exhales)

1363
01:32:38,343 --> 01:32:41,046
(shoes thud on floor)

1364
01:33:10,142 --> 01:33:11,978
(electricity crackling)

1365
01:33:37,102 --> 01:33:39,738
(bones cracking)

1366
01:33:44,942 --> 01:33:46,445
Aah!

1367
01:33:46,478 --> 01:33:48,914
(laughs)

1368
01:34:12,771 --> 01:34:15,140
(animal growls)

1369
01:35:18,236 --> 01:35:21,073
(breathing heavily)

1370
01:35:29,347 --> 01:35:32,384
(heart beating)

1371
01:35:52,304 --> 01:35:54,940
(animal growls)

1372
01:35:54,973 --> 01:35:59,378
(laughs)

1373
01:36:02,914 --> 01:36:05,250
Okay, Ray, I'm off to set.

1374
01:36:05,282 --> 01:36:07,385
Despite my fanbase,
they still want me.

1375
01:36:07,419 --> 01:36:10,389
So, well, I must have
done something right.

1376
01:36:11,889 --> 01:36:14,325
(groans)

1377
01:36:14,358 --> 01:36:17,028
Ew, that doesn't feel right.

1378
01:36:17,062 --> 01:36:19,430
I better not get my period.

1379
01:36:19,464 --> 01:36:22,434
Ray. Honey.

1380
01:36:22,467 --> 01:36:25,571
Ray. Don't pout.

1381
01:36:25,603 --> 01:36:27,472
I love you.

1382
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:31,410
- (doorbell rings)
- Lilly: Coming.

1383
01:36:31,442 --> 01:36:34,045
That's my co-star
and my driver.

1384
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:36,849
I will call you
when I get to my trailer.

1385
01:36:36,881 --> 01:36:39,451
(groans)

1386
01:36:42,219 --> 01:36:45,523
You know, maybe you should
go outside, get some sun.

1387
01:36:45,557 --> 01:36:48,059
Bye, babe.

1388
01:36:49,126 --> 01:36:50,629
- Hi.
- Hey, Angie.

1389
01:36:50,661 --> 01:36:52,496
- Are you ready for this?
- Oh, honey.

1390
01:36:52,530 --> 01:36:54,099
Lilly: Ugh.
Thanks for everything.

1391
01:36:54,131 --> 01:36:55,467
Angela:
Of course.

1392
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,069
Lilly:
Girl, I don't feel good.

1393
01:36:57,102 --> 01:36:58,503
Like, I don't... I haven't
gotten my period yet.

1394
01:36:58,536 --> 01:37:00,339
I don't know what it is.
But it's all right.

1395
01:37:00,371 --> 01:37:02,240
Oh, hey.

1396
01:37:02,273 --> 01:37:04,508
I'm so excited.

1397
01:37:04,541 --> 01:37:07,545
Angela: (Southern accent) Why, hello,
Sheriff. What can we do for you?

1398
01:37:07,579 --> 01:37:10,148
Lilly: (Southern accent) Yes,
what can we do for you, Sheriff?

1399
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:11,950
Sheriff:
(clears throat)

1400
01:37:11,982 --> 01:37:13,918
Sorry for showing up
unannounced and all,

1401
01:37:13,951 --> 01:37:16,521
but there's been
some complaints in town

1402
01:37:16,554 --> 01:37:20,125
about strange happenings
at your place at night.

1403
01:37:20,157 --> 01:37:22,294
Angela:
What kinda strange things?

1404
01:37:22,326 --> 01:37:24,929
Lilly: Would you care
for some tea?

1405
01:37:24,963 --> 01:37:27,331
Sheriff: Something about an out
of towner staying with you ladies.

1406
01:37:27,365 --> 01:37:29,902
Uh, heard a little thing.

1407
01:37:29,934 --> 01:37:32,504
Angela:
I see.

1408
01:37:32,536 --> 01:37:37,041
Talks of witchcraft
and blood sacrifices.

1409
01:37:37,075 --> 01:37:38,610
Lilly:
Witchcraft?

1410
01:37:38,643 --> 01:37:42,447
Angela:
Blood sacrifices?

1411
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:44,582
(coughs)

1412
01:37:44,616 --> 01:37:46,919
Whoa.
That's got some kick.

1413
01:37:46,951 --> 01:37:49,487
(laughs)
Best tea in all of Texas.

1414
01:37:50,487 --> 01:37:52,057
He is so sweet to Nina.

1415
01:38:01,165 --> 01:38:03,568
(gurgles)

1416
01:38:12,043 --> 01:38:15,280
(laughs)

1417
01:38:15,312 --> 01:38:17,114
You like that?

1418
01:38:17,147 --> 01:38:18,683
Yeah.
Yeah, it looked good.

1419
01:38:18,717 --> 01:38:22,086
(laughs)
I'm a master.

1420
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:25,524
Angela: ...An ungrateful swig
of content.

1421
01:38:25,557 --> 01:38:28,226
Hey, yo, add Lilly's likes

Yo, boss.

I'm sorry. Oh!

Dr. Ulrich: Time and space
can be manipulated...

1456
01:40:44,362 --> 01:40:48,233
fused together
and then displaced

1457
01:40:48,265 --> 01:40:52,071

an entirely new reality.

1458
01:40:56,206 --> 01:40:59,311
Juice:
You think we are not alone.

1459
01:41:01,411 --> 01:41:04,449
We've been visited
by many alien life forms.

1460
01:41:10,487 --> 01:41:15,193
And now that Texas tea
turns to blood.
