1
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,267
What a town.

2
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,200
If they only knew was out there.

3
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,233
I mean, what's really out there.

4
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:14,433
I was there and I
still don't believe it.

5
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:18,467
Guess I should start at
the beginning... the night

6
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,033
of my first wedding anniversary.

7
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,220
-Happy anniversary, darling.

8
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:49,067
$12,326.18 for what?

9
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,100
Continental Hotel?

10
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,209
Continental Hotel.

11
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:03,700
How may I direct your call?

12
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,200
-Reservations, please.

13
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:06,443
I'll transfer you.

14
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,300
-Thank you.

15
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,400
Continental Hotel,
may I help you?

16
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:12,267
-Yes, this is Richard Clarke.

17
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,800
Yes, Mr. Clarke.

18
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,267
How may I help you?

19
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,167
- I got my credit card
bill today and there's

20
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,433
some charges to your hotel.

21
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:18,576
All right,

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,100
and which night are
you referring to?

23
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:20,933
-What do you mean, which night?

24
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:22,309
Well, you've

25
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,609
been staying here
quite a bit lately.

26
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:26,167
In fact, Mrs. Clarke just
made another reservation

27
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,167
for tomorrow night.

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,500
-Janet Clarke?

29
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,643
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,567
-This is her husband, Richard.

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,800
Is there a problem, Mr. Clarke?

32
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
-No.

33
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,433
No.

34
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:47,167
Listen, don't tell Mrs.
Clarke that we talked.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,667
I'd hate to ruin her surprise.

36
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,309
Of course, Mr. Clarke.

37
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,433
And by the way, thank you again
for that very generous tip

38
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,467
last week.

39
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,467
-You're welcome.

40
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,340
And happy anniversary.

41
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:09,100
My marriage was a lie.

42
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,500
I was humiliated.

43
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:14,800
How could I go on?

44
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,367
So I got drunk.

45
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Tried to kill myself.

46
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:36,600
That didn't work.

47
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,633
-Damn.

48
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:44,667
Then I saw
this infomercial on television.

49
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,400
-Life got you down?

50
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:49,167
Are you tired of your
current existence?

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,600
Are you at the end of your rope?

52
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:53,067
Then become one of
the undead, where

53
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,800
immortality is waiting for you.

54
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,567
It only takes a minute, just
a little nip on the neck

55
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,567
and you're through.

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,033
Join our legions and you'll
meet new and interesting people.

57
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:07,433
And the nightlife is killer.

58
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:09,067
Because of Kiss of
Death, Inc., you're

59
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,400
only a bite away
from immortality.

60
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:16,233
So pick up the phone
and call 1-888-Bite Me

61
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:17,267
That's 1-888-BiteMe.

62
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:21,367
Our operators are standing by.

63
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,567
Call now.

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,667
- Yes, I'd like to
join your legions.

65
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,533
So I called
Kiss of Death, Incorporated.

66
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,267
They said a service
representative

67
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,476
would appear
tomorrow at midnight.

68
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,367
This was the answer
I was looking for.

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,033
Cut that cheating
bitch out of my will.

70
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:41,333
Come back undead,
get my revenge.

71
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:44,533
-You're going to pay, Janet.

72
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:45,767
You're both going to pay.

73
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,300
-Hi.

74
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,233
-Payback's a bitch.

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,133
Would
you help me with my choker?

76
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,167
-Sure.

77
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,767
You come back later.

78
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,133
I've got a little
surprise for you.

79
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,300
-What is it?

80
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,233
-You'll see.

81
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:58,033
-I should be home by 1-ish.

82
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,067
-Perfect.

83
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:12,333
-What was that for?

84
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:15,333
- I just wanted you to
know how much I love you.

85
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:16,733
-Well, I love you, too.

86
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,033
Duh.

87
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:20,067
-Goodbye, Janet.

88
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,413
-I'll see you later, honey.

89
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:40,267
Since I
was going to become undead,

90
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,200
I figured I could pick
up a few pointers.

91
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,267
-Forget it.

92
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,543
So I started to have

93
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,333
some very serious
second thoughts

94
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:57,367
about this whole thing.

95
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:09,500
-No!

96
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,233
It's not very nice, is it?

97
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:17,267
-Sorry.

98
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,733
Sorry.

99
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:24,433
- Aren't you going
to invite me in?

100
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:26,033
-Yeah.

101
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:29,367
Yeah, come on in.

102
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,367
Her name was Lillith.

103
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,533
-Nice place.

104
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,733
Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,

105
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:36,667
after all.

106
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,367
- I've got to tell
you, you're not at all

107
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,100
like what I expected.

108
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:42,267
-What were you expecting?

109
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,133
Some 6'2 guy with long
hair and a goatee.

110
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,100
-Kind of, yeah.

111
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:49,133
-Oh, god.

112
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,167
-You're very beautiful.

113
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,600
-I think you're very handsome.

114
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:07,133
And I'm real sorry to
hear about your wife.

115
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,400
-How do you know about my wife?

116
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:13,100
-Well, word is she gets around.

117
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:14,033
-Look, Richard.

118
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,367
You're really much
better off without her.

119
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,300
You're much too good of a guy
to be with someone like that.

120
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,543
Any woman would

121
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:24,767
be lucky to have
someone like you.

122
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:50,400
- So, should we get
down to business.

123
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:51,533
-Oh yeah.

124
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:55,733
Listen, um when I become
undead, will I see you again?

125
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,333
-Yes, if you want to.

126
00:09:57,367 --> 00:10:01,667
- I want to spend the rest
of my life... well, you know.

127
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,167
-Forever and ever.

128
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
-Forever and ever.

129
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:14,033
OK, let's do it.

130
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,400
Be careful, I'm a bleeder.

131
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,700
- I hope that it was as good
for you as it was for me.

132
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,367
Everything
was going according to plan.

133
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,300
Janet's about to get
what she deserves.

134
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,167
Here's the part
where she finds out

135
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,467
I wrote her out of the will.

136
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,333
- But he... he can't
do this to me.

137
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,800
-Wow, look at the time.

138
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,333
I've got to run, Janet, or I'll
be late for that board meeting.

139
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:29,667
I'll call you later.

140
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,633
-Jonathan!

141
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:33,567
Don't leave me like this!

142
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,300
How could you do
this to me, you prick?

143
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:42,800
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Clarke, but
we have to move Mr. Clarke back

144
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:46,733
to the mortuary for
his final preparation.

145
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:49,300
- Mr. Vincent, there's
been a sudden change

146
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,400
in the will of Richard's estate.

147
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:54,400
There won't be enough money to
cover the burial arrangements,

148
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:57,667
as we had originally planned.

149
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,100
-Oh.

150
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,267
Well, I'll tell
you what I'll do.

151
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,200
We have a special this
week on cremations.

152
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:08,500
I'll put your original
deposits towards that,

153
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:10,667
and we'll call it even.

154
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,300
- I'm sure Richard would
have wanted it that way.

155
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,443
- I didn't realize that by
cutting her out of the will,

156
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:21,667
I'd be shooting
myself in the foot.

157
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,600
My dreams of immortality
were about to go

158
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:28,300
right out the do window.

159
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,300
-OK, Jimmy.

160
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,300
Better fire up the over.

161
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,700
Looks like we've got
another live one.

162
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,533
-Look out!

163
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:30,767
Careful!

164
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,400
They ought to
revoke your license.

165
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:34,167
You're a menace with that thing.

166
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,267
- I'm not used to
driving a stick.

167
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,067
Are they here yet?

168
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,233
-No, they're late.

169
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:42,233
I don't know about
this thing, Jimmy.

170
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,600
-We go over this every time.

171
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,500
We would be doing
great business if it

172
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:50,600
wasn't for that big earthquake
last year that hurt my legs.

173
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,533
- Yeah, and funerals
with National

174
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,700
snatching up all the stiffs.

175
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:57,733
Nobody wants to do business with
us, the little guy, anymore.

176
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:03,667
- Look, this is the only way
we can stay above ground.

177
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Here they come!

178
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,800
- Greetings on behalf of exalted
and most unholy master, Satan.

179
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,733
-Howdy.

180
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:24,733
-Let's get this over with.

181
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:30,667
-This the best you could do?

182
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,367
- It's getting harder to find
guys to your specifications.

183
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,033
- What do you do
with them, anyway?

184
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:37,667
-We're in a cult.

185
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,567
What do you think?

186
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,533
-Please!

187
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:41,567
-It's nothing personal.

188
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,400
-You know what?

189
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:01,733
These guys aren't
going anywhere.

190
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,567
If we leave and come
back, we can still

191
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,067
catch the last half of the game.

192
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
-Good.

193
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:15,000
- Been a pleasure doing
business with you gentlemen.

194
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,533
-Oh my god!

195
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:48,567
Shit!

196
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:24,133
Bingo.

197
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:46,133
-Oh hey, doc.

198
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:47,476
If you're doing a
brain operation,

199
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,700
why don't you
start with my wife?

200
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:53,233
-Hi, Jonathan.

201
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:55,100
-How do you know my name?

202
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:58,567
Do I owe you money?

203
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,700
I know you, don't I?

204
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:01,933
-You should.

205
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:05,000
You screwed my wife and then
drank champagne at my funeral.

206
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,533
-Richard.

207
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,133
But you're dead.

208
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,500
-Do I look dead to you?

209
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,467
Where's Janet?

210
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,067
- Janet, she left me
for some internet geek

211
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,033
from the Silicone Valley.

212
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,100
She dumped me.

213
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:26,033
-I'm sorry.

214
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:29,333
Must have been hard for you.

215
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:30,400
-Don't kill me.

216
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:31,167
Oh, don't kill me.

217
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,533
Whatever you want.

218
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:35,133
-How about breakfast.

219
00:18:49,433 --> 00:18:50,400
Are you being

220
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,733
buried by the high cost
of funeral arrangements?

221
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,367
Then come to Coffin
Stuffers where

222
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,300
we discount death for you.

223
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,333
We have a wide variety
of funeral packages,

224
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:01,467
from our no-frills funeral where
you get a shovel and a shove,

225
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,667
to our deluxe cadaver package,
which includes coffin, flowers,

226
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,133
and designer burial suit
with two pair of pants.

227
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:09,700
So don't get stiffed
over the high cost

228
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,200
of funeral arrangements,
because at Coffin Stuffers,

229
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:14,767
we're the last ones
to let you down.

230
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,700
Coffin Stuffers... we bury
that cost along with the loss.

231
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:26,033
-What is this world coming to?

232
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,800
-Tell me.

233
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,400
-Richard.

234
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,400
How...

235
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:34,500
-Kiss of Death, Incorporated.

236
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:37,633
-I went to your funeral.

237
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:38,767
Janet had you cremated.

238
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,800
- Apparently she never
bothered to pick up my ashes.

239
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:45,267
I got reanimated at the morgue
next to three dead bodies.

240
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,100
- Guess that would
explain the blood.

241
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,467
- Actually, this is
from something else.

242
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,767
I need to find the vampire
that originally bit me.

243
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,867
-Oh, Richard.

244
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,267
I mean, so much has happened
in the last five years.

245
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,267
-Five years.

246
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
-You better sit down.

247
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:09,333
Try to keep the blood
off the leather.

248
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:13,067
Because of Kiss of Death,
the vampire epidemic

249
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,467
went out of control.

250
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,433
So the government
formed a special unit

251
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:21,200
of vampire hunters... Stake
Force... to exterminate

252
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,400
anything that went
bump in the night.

253
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:26,467
-So what happened?

254
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,433
-There was a war.

255
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:30,433
They all got wiped out.

256
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:33,433
-Did any of them survive?

257
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:36,733
- As far as the public
is concerned, no.

258
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:40,467
But there's still
reports here and there.

259
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,633
-This isn't what I wanted.

260
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:46,567
-Richard, we all make mistakes.

261
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,433
We just have to go on
and live our lives.

262
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:51,433
-That's easy for you to say.

263
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:52,367
-Listen.

264
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,533
There's an underground
club in Hollywood.

265
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:57,167
You talk to a guy named Boris.

266
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,500
He's a good friend of mine.

267
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:01,467
Very heavy into the occult.

268
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,433
I think he can help you.

269
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:06,767
-Thanks, Dan.

270
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,333
I knew I could count on you.

271
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,447
-Hey, what are friends for?

272
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,333
-I'll be in touch.

273
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:14,367
-Good luck, Richard.

274
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:21,333
And Richard... you might
want to change that shirt.

275
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,367
-Where'd you come from?

276
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,467
-I'm with them.

277
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,433
-I don't think so.

278
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:55,700
-I'm on the list.

279
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:58,500
-There is no list.

280
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:00,800
-Uh, I'm a friend of Boris?

281
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,033
- Why didn't you say
so in the first place?

282
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:35,633
-Hey.

283
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:36,633
What can I get you?

284
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,667
-I'm looking for Boris.

285
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,400
-He should be here by now.

286
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:43,433
-Can I help you with something?

287
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:45,433
-I'm good.

288
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:46,467
-Let me know.

289
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,333
-Hey man, what's up?

290
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:14,333
-What's it to you?

291
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:17,767
- Haven't seen you
in here before.

292
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,100
-You're hitting on me?

293
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,133
-No.

294
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,700
Man, I can hook you up.

295
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:27,067
X, GHB, anything you need.

296
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,467
I aim to please.

297
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,433
-I'm not interested in that.

298
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm looking for a girl.

299
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,367
-Dark hair, penetrating eyes.

300
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,633
-Take your pick.

301
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:42,767
-She was dancing over there.

302
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,133
-That's

303
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:46,233
-You know her?

304
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:47,509
-Well yeah, everybody knows her.

305
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:52,267
But very few people really know
her, if you know what I mean.

306
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,633
-I'd like to talk to her.

307
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:57,367
-I'll tell you what.

308
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,300
There's a private
party downstairs,

309
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:02,100
and I know for sure
she's going to be there.

310
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:04,467
I can get you in.

311
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,500
It's to die for.

312
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:08,467
-Let's go.

313
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
-Come on.

314
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,000
So, you're gonna love this.

315
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,333
It's just down here, man.

316
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:44,900
It's OK.

317
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:45,933
He's with me.

318
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:50,667
-Twins.

319
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,033
-What the hell is this?

320
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,800
-People, places, roll film.

321
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:17,533
-It's video.

322
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:18,300
-Whatever.

323
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,333
Action!

324
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:26,633
-Oh, I get it.

325
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:43,800
-The need to feed!

326
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,367
-Wow, looks real.

327
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,733
-Just watch.

328
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:49,633
- What the hell is
wrong with you people?!

329
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:53,633
-This is a snuff film.

330
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:54,633
-You idiot.

331
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:58,633
He's a vampire.

332
00:25:58,667 --> 00:25:59,667
-Where's the writer?

333
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:04,633
-Ah, shit!

334
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,167
-You're really good.

335
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,200
It's a fucking
bloodbath in there.

336
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:45,100
-They said I'd be a star.

337
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:47,200
-Better check your contract.

338
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
This town will kill you.

339
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,133
Sorry.

340
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,467
-Hey, he's up here.

341
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,100
He went out the back door.

342
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:33,433
-There he is.

343
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:34,467
Get him!

344
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:39,033
-The sun's coming up.

345
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:40,109
Get in if you want to live.

346
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:42,233
-Do I have a choice?

347
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,233
-You're dead!

348
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:44,267
You hear me?

349
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,167
-I guess I should thank you.

350
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,067
-I'm Mary.

351
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,433
-Richard.

352
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:55,533
-Look, we're in a safe place.

353
00:27:55,567 --> 00:28:00,233
But for security reasons, I'm
going to have to blindfold you.

354
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:02,767
- I'm usually not into
that sort of thing.

355
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,300
-Just trust me.

356
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:06,567
-I guess I'll have to.

357
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,700
-Where are we?

358
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:36,300
- Welcome to Hell House, formerly
Hellman Correctional Facility.

359
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,467
Now it's our home.

360
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,033
-Cozy.

361
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:43,067
-Mommy, mommy!

362
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:47,567
Hi, Mister.

363
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm Lindsey.

364
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:49,500
What's yours?

365
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:50,533
-I'm Richard.

366
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:54,767
What are you all doing here?

367
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
-Tell him.

368
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,733
We are like you.

369
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:01,767
Vampires.

370
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:07,167
-We're not vampires.

371
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,767
-Technically, we are.

372
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Part human, part vampire.

373
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:13,833
Half-breeds.

374
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,633
- That's why they
call me half pint.

375
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,633
- About time you
got here, Reeger.

376
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:36,333
-Yeah.

377
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:38,167
Where are the rest of my bodies?

378
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,167
- They're already
in the meat wagon.

379
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,100
- Who is this new
partner of mine?

380
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:47,233
-Are you OK, Steve?

381
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:49,100
-I'm fine, thank you.

382
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:52,267
-He looks a little green to me.

383
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,333
-Anybody want a bite?

384
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,543
- Hey kid, if you want
to work homicide,

385
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:02,600
you've got to get used
to this side of life.

386
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:05,133
-This was in the camera.

387
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,633
Man, talk about a reality show.

388
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:15,733
Shit, what are these
guys doing here?

389
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:17,367
-Who are they?

390
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,767
- VSI, Vampire Scene
Investigation.

391
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,700
Hey guys, thanks a lot,
but we got this covered.

392
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:27,500
Hey, I'm talking to you guys.

393
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:32,433
-Hey, Reeger.

394
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:34,333
They only take orders from me.

395
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:46,700
-Linda.

396
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:48,300
-Yes, sir?

397
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,400
-Send in Peters and Reeger.

398
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:51,333
- Peters!

399
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:53,067
Reeger!

400
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,100
Captain wants to see
you in his office, now!

401
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,633
-You wanted to see us, Cap?

402
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,633
-Yeah.

403
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,667
So how you guys doing?

404
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,433
-Fine, sir.

405
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:12,867
-Good.

406
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,500
-Well, I'm not.

407
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:16,067
I've got seven dead bodies.

408
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,533
-Uh, sir, it looks a hemo.

409
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,700
- That's sexual
profiling, Peters.

410
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:25,400
-Hemo as in hemoglobin, sir.

411
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:26,333
-A vampire.

412
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:29,800
-I don't give a damn what it is.

413
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,467
I want it taken out.

414
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:32,900
Now.

415
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:33,767
You understand?

416
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,500
-Yes, sir.

417
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:37,400
-So what do we got?

418
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:39,153
- We got some actual
footage from the crime.

419
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:01,833
-Jesus.

420
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,367
So what do you think?

421
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,767
- I didn't care much for the
story, but the acting was good.

422
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,667
- We don't need a
smart ass, Reeger.

423
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,033
We need results.

424
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:17,533
- The good news is we know
what our hemo looks like.

425
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:20,033
I'll get an APP
at him right away.

426
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:21,400
-Wrong, junior.

427
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:22,667
I'm in and you're out.

428
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,767
Whenever there's a blood sucker
involved, it becomes my case.

429
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,200
-Our guess was right.

430
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:31,500
This file is in the
stakes jurisdiction.

431
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:35,633
Anyway, Reeger, we got
enough nutcases out there

432
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,267
to keep you occupied.

433
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,067
-But sir, this...

434
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,800
-We're doing it, Reeger.

435
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:39,833
That's all.

436
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,700
-Amateurs.

437
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:53,100
-They're damn good cops.

438
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:55,800
Anyway, we're all
in this together.

439
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:58,133
-Of course we are, sir.

440
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,233
My people are already
on top of this.

441
00:33:00,267 --> 00:33:01,776
We've just got a lead on
the vampire safe house

442
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,133
and we're about to hit it.

443
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:04,433
-Just do it quietly.

444
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:06,209
I don't want the public to
think there are vampires

445
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:07,673
still running loose
in these streets.

446
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:17,167
- If you don't get it right,
there will be hell to pay.

447
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,467
And I'll make sure your ass
is at the head of the line.

448
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
-Hardcastle.

449
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,300
Good.

450
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,333
Assemble in 10.

451
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,567
- So how did you guys
wind up in this place?

452
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,100
- Well, we had no
place left to hide.

453
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:49,633
We worked really hard to
build a community here.

454
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,767
-Well, you must be Richard.

455
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,067
Word travels faster around here.

456
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,733
I'm Celeste.

457
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:02,367
And this is my
little girl, Debbie.

458
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,533
We certainly you're
going to be staying.

459
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:08,133
Been a long time since we had
any fresh blood around here.

460
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:11,133
-Celeste.

461
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:13,100
-Oh.

462
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,893
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to be inappropriate.

463
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:20,633
-Mommy, can we go play, please?

464
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:21,367
-Yeah, sure.

465
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,333
Go ahead.

466
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:23,300
-Excuse me, Celeste.

467
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,567
We've got some important
messages to discuss.

468
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,400
-Oh, of course.

469
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,567
-Nice meeting you.

470
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,700
-I'll be seeing you, Richard.

471
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:34,233
-I'm sorry about that.

472
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:37,233
Celeste lost her husband
during the epidemic.

473
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:37,933
-What about Lindsey?

474
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:40,667
Is her father a half-breed, too?

475
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,167
-I don't know.

476
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,800
Oh, Lindsey's not
my biological child.

477
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:50,133
I've actually never
been with a man before.

478
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:53,500
I adopted Lindsey after
her parents were killed.

479
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:55,100
-Sorry.

480
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,100
- For years, we've been
caught up in the war

481
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:59,700
between a gang of bloodthirsty
creatures, the bleeders,

482
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:02,333
and the human assassins...
The Stick Force.

483
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:03,400
-Yeah.

484
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:06,133
I already heard about
the vampire hunters club.

485
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,167
-There's more.

486
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:19,367
-Can I ask you something?

487
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,500
-Sure, Ken.

488
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:21,533
-Why do you hate them?

489
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:22,367
-Who?

490
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,700
-Vampires.

491
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:24,800
-Who doesn't?

492
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,300
-I don't.

493
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,100
I had a friend once
who got bitten,

494
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:29,709
and it turned out to
be this thing where...

495
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:30,700
-Oh, please.

496
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:31,776
Don't tell me you're one
of those liberals who

497
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,433
think that vampires and
human beings can co-exist.

498
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,333
What else do I need
to know about you?

499
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:39,400
-I'm LDS.

500
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:41,600
- Are you seeing
someone for that?

501
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:43,533
-Latter Day Saints.

502
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:45,367
-Oh, what do you mean?

503
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,067
You don't smoke and you
don't drink and you never...

504
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:53,433
- No man shall lay
down with a woman

505
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,533
unless they are
bound by marriage.

506
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,433
- You don't think I know
what's going on here?

507
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:04,167
Hmm?

508
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,733
Sure, sure, I fell off the
wagon after I lost my partner.

509
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:10,200
And my wife left me after
that hooker incident.

510
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:13,133
- Which he was cleared
of, by the way.

511
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:15,767
Sorry.

512
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,133
- So now Internal Affairs sends
me some squeaky clean rookie

513
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:21,067
who's got up my ass
trying to keep me

514
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,000
on the straight and narrow.

515
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:23,667
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

516
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,600
-You don't, huh?

517
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:26,400
Well, here's a news
flash for you, kid.

518
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:28,309
I don't care why they put
you with me, understand?

519
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,476
What I do care about is when
I'm out there on the street

520
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,776
and the shit's
hitting the fan, I

521
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
want to make sure that
someone's watching my ass.

522
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,667
- You don't have
to worry about me.

523
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,500
-Are you sure?

524
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:37,167
-I'm sure.

525
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,280
-Are you fucking sure, huh?

526
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
-Please don't swear.

527
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,333
-Brethren!

528
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,167
The word has come from on high.

529
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,100
Tonight we vanquish our foes.

530
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:14,000
For the only good
human is a dead human.

531
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:23,300
Kill them all and let the
dark lord sort them out.

532
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:26,700
Tonight is ours.

533
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:30,267
Tonight we draw for straws.

534
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:40,433
- I cannot wait to dust
me some bloodsuckers.

535
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,400
-Fucking right.

536
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:46,600
-I love to watch them bleed.

537
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:48,067
-All right.

538
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,133
Listen up.

539
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,700
This is strictly a stake
and bake operation.

540
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:55,267
You know the drill.

541
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,067
Rule number one... no survivors.

542
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,367
Rule number two... no survivors.

543
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,767
And rule number three...

544
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,133
-Everyone comes home alive.

545
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,667
-That's right.

546
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,667
Do your final weapons check.

547
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,300
We roll in 10.

548
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:11,333
-Yes, sir!

549
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:35,133
- Daddy, I thought you were
coming to my birthday party.

550
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:36,133
-I'm sorry, sweetie.

551
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:37,500
Daddy has to work tonight.

552
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:39,133
Put your mother on, please.

553
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:44,500
-Is everything all right?

554
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:45,573
-Hold on one second, babe.

555
00:38:49,467 --> 00:38:52,133
Sweetie, I've got
to get back to work.

556
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,533
-I love you.

557
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:54,567
-I love you, too.

558
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,367
-No, no.

559
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,367
No!

560
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,767
Baby!

561
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:39,433
-Daddy, we're hungry.

562
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
-No!

563
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,260
-But Daddy, it's my birthday!

564
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:02,567
-Let's roll.

565
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:16,100
- There are a number of
ways of becoming a vampire.

566
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:20,467
Bitten on the neck then
turned, or genetically.

567
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,576
-That's what happened to me.

568
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,400
- A few years ago,
evil terrorists

569
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:28,667
contaminated the plasma at
some of the major blood banks.

570
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:34,067
I working on a serum by the
government while I was exposed.

571
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,700
- They herded us into quarantine
camps for vaccination,

572
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:40,467
but we quickly discovered
it was for extermination.

573
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,367
-For being infected?

574
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,776
- Well, since they had
no cure, the government

575
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,067
felt it be cheaper to
just kill us than cure us.

576
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,667
-A few of us managed to escape.

577
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,500
- Like full vampires, we
can only come out at night.

578
00:41:52,533 --> 00:41:53,667
But we're not immortal.

579
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,367
-Do you still drink blood?

580
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,767
-Yes, but not human blood.

581
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,100
- I developed a variety of
synthetic alternatives,

582
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:03,133
including this.

583
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:07,467
-What is it?

584
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,267
-A blood patch.

585
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,400
Similar to a nicotine
patch, except if weans

586
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:16,100
the user off blood.

587
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,733
-How long does that take?

588
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:18,767
-About 30 years.

589
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,033
With our extended
lifespan, it's not so long.

590
00:42:28,133 --> 00:42:30,067
Well, I have to go back to work.

591
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:35,667
- So what were you
doing at Club Sinister?

592
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,567
-Looking for someone, something.

593
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,333
What about you?

594
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:43,800
-Looking for more lost souls.

595
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:45,267
-You hit the jackpot.

596
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,633
-I guess I did.

597
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:49,667
-So how did you find me?

598
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,809
- Well, when I saw you enter
the club, for some reason

599
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:56,167
you just looked
more lost than most.

600
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,367
-Thanks.

601
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,067
-So how did you become a...

602
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:05,700
- Vampire&amp;gt; Kiss of
Death, Incorporated.

603
00:43:05,733 --> 00:43:08,233
-Why?

604
00:43:08,267 --> 00:43:10,400
-I thought it was what I wanted.

605
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:13,567
Instead, I lost everything.

606
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,367
-So did we.

607
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,033
I mean, that's why
we're all here.

608
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:20,600
Helping each other survive.

609
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:23,600
- I guess we're all
in this together.

610
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:26,200
-Yeah, I guess so.

611
00:43:26,233 --> 00:43:27,567
-Mary!

612
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,567
I think I found it!

613
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,567
-Get your bags!

614
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,567
Get out!

615
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,567
-Lindsey!

616
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,167
-Mary, wait!

617
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,600
Let's get out of here!

618
00:44:04,133 --> 00:44:05,133
-Let's go!

619
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:36,033
-Hi!

620
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:37,067
This is a clown.

621
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,367
-Freeze!

622
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,367
-It's cool, man.

623
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,400
It's cool.

624
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,300
-Hey, Bozo.

625
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,300
I hate clowns.

626
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,300
-Hey, cutie.

627
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:02,233
-It's been awhile.

628
00:46:02,267 --> 00:46:03,733
I almost got you in Barstow.

629
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:07,333
-I let you live that night.

630
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:09,700
No more free passes
for old time's sake.

631
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:12,333
- You used to be one of
the best on the team.

632
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:22,267
-This time you.

633
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:33,200
Just like old times.

634
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:34,600
-Not tonight, bitch.

635
00:46:45,133 --> 00:46:47,133
-Don't play hard to get with me.

636
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:58,467
-It's been fun.

637
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,067
-Hey, asshole.

638
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,733
-Huh?

639
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:20,567
-You want some of this?

640
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,600
Come on. Come on.

641
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,667
-Time to die.

642
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,700
-You first.

643
00:47:54,267 --> 00:47:55,267
-Not time.

644
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,800
-Richard.

645
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:44,433
-It's me!

646
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:45,633
We've got to get out of here!

647
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:47,500
-You think?

648
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:48,533
Let's go.

649
00:48:53,467 --> 00:48:54,067
It's clear.

650
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,467
I'll catch up to you guys.

651
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:07,200
-Richard.

652
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:08,567
-My god, it's you.

653
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,167
-I thought you were dead.

654
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,167
-Yeah, so did I.

655
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,033
-Kill him.

656
00:49:13,067 --> 00:49:13,400
-No.

657
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:13,933
-Why?

658
00:49:13,967 --> 00:49:14,733
-Because he's mine.

659
00:49:14,767 --> 00:49:17,600
-He's not one of us.

660
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:21,633
- I turned him, and according to
bleeder law, he belongs to me.

661
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,433
-Orders were no survivors.

662
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:25,033
-I decide his fate.

663
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:32,233
-For now.

664
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:35,367
Take him away.

665
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,433
- You'd better watch
your neck, my sister.

666
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:41,433
- You may have
turned him, but you

667
00:49:41,467 --> 00:49:43,633
don't forget who turned you.

668
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,400
- Hey, since we're
after vampires,

669
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:03,667
is that why they
call it a stake out?

670
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,600
- Look, back at the
station, I just

671
00:50:12,633 --> 00:50:16,300
needed to know you could
handle yourself under pressure.

672
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,267
-Forget it.

673
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,667
- Yeah, that was a
hell of a move, kid.

674
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,400
-Thanks.

675
00:50:24,433 --> 00:50:26,143
- Looks like we're going
to be here for awhile.

676
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:28,300
- I'm glad I brought
a good book to read.

677
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:30,043
- Yeah, well you'll find
that a good detective has

678
00:50:30,067 --> 00:50:32,433
to to be patient
to solve a case.

679
00:50:32,467 --> 00:50:34,633
- We're not supposed
to be on this case.

680
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,600
-Thanks for reminding me.

681
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:41,367
-Hello.

682
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,600
-Reeger, it's Michaels.

683
00:50:42,633 --> 00:50:44,167
-Ah, what's up, Chief?

684
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,567
-Look, Reeger.

685
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,233
I know how you operate.

686
00:50:47,267 --> 00:50:49,309
I want to be sure you're
still not working this case.

687
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:50,167
-No, Chief.

688
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,067
I just got out of
my spinning class.

689
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,733
- I'm telling you... you leave
the dirty work to Hardcastle

690
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:58,667
and his goon hunters,
you understand?

691
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,300
- Chief, I got you
the first time, OK?

692
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:02,600
Look, I got to get cleaned
up for my internet date.

693
00:51:02,633 --> 00:51:05,033
-I mean it, Reeger.

694
00:51:05,067 --> 00:51:06,233
-Chief, I got to go.

695
00:51:06,267 --> 00:51:07,267
Bye.

696
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,167
-He says, keep up the good work.

697
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,667
-What took so long?

698
00:51:32,267 --> 00:51:34,667
Just because I am
an immortal does not

699
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,667
mean that I have all
the time in the world.

700
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,633
It all goes to preparations.

701
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:46,067
-There was a problem.

702
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,433
-What?

703
00:51:47,467 --> 00:51:49,533
- The Stake Force
was already there.

704
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:53,233
-How many casualties?

705
00:51:53,267 --> 00:51:54,267
-Too many.

706
00:51:57,167 --> 00:52:02,633
- I'm assuming that you
secured the sacrifice?

707
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:05,433
-She managed to escape.

708
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:07,433
-But they had to protect her.

709
00:52:07,467 --> 00:52:10,100
- I believe that he is
the chosen one, Master.

710
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:15,567
-A vampire with a soul.

711
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,400
Can it be?

712
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,733
Can it be?

713
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:24,567
-But it's only a legend.

714
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,600
-Silence.

715
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,733
And so, the prophecy unfolds
exactly as I had foreseen.

716
00:52:33,767 --> 00:52:35,267
Where is he?

717
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,600
Now.

718
00:52:36,633 --> 00:52:38,033
-We have him.

719
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:40,700
-I need to know his intentions.

720
00:52:40,733 --> 00:52:42,767
-Let me have him.

721
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,300
-No.

722
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,233
I turned him.

723
00:52:46,267 --> 00:52:47,433
It is my duty, Master.

724
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,300
-So it's your burden, Lillith.

725
00:52:58,267 --> 00:53:03,167
Bring him over to our side,
but if you fail at this,

726
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,167
then his blood must
flow this very night.

727
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:37,267
-Freeze, turkey.

728
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,333
-Easy, Dirty Harry.

729
00:53:41,233 --> 00:53:42,233
-Sorry.

730
00:53:42,267 --> 00:53:43,300
What's happening?

731
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:45,533
-Did Tom turn up, hey?

732
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:46,567
Come on.

733
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:53,433
-Hey, Stank.

734
00:53:53,467 --> 00:53:55,733
- I see you've got
something for me?

735
00:53:55,767 --> 00:53:57,433
-Always do.

736
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:58,467
-OK.

737
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:04,700
I'm a little short this
week, so just spot me, OK?

738
00:54:04,733 --> 00:54:06,173
- What do I look
like, the Red Cross?

739
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,233
-You look like an asshole.

740
00:54:12,267 --> 00:54:15,200
Fucking son of a bitch.

741
00:54:15,233 --> 00:54:16,233
-Fucking vampires.

742
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:29,233
-Hey!

743
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:30,067
-Dammit, Reeger!

744
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,633
I could have ripped
your throat out.

745
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:34,367
- You couldn't rip a
fart out of your ass.

746
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,133
-No need to get personal.

747
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:38,133
-Peters, meet Stank.

748
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:39,400
Stank, meet Peters.

749
00:54:39,433 --> 00:54:44,400
- Why do they call
you... oh, nevermind.

750
00:54:44,433 --> 00:54:48,367
- Stank is my snitch,
aren't you, Stank?

751
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,300
- I prefer the term
purveyor of information.

752
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:54,400
- So why don't you tell me about
the murders at Club Sinister?

753
00:54:54,433 --> 00:54:56,367
-That was a real mess.

754
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,033
-I know it was a mess.

755
00:54:57,067 --> 00:54:58,733
I was there cleaning it up.

756
00:54:58,767 --> 00:55:00,700
- Well, there's been lots
of bloodshed lately.

757
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:01,633
First, Club Sinister.

758
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:04,000
Then your peeps hit
the vamp sanctuary.

759
00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:10,567
Huh, you didn't
know about that one?

760
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,000
I guess you're out of the loop.

761
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:15,767
Get to the point.

762
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:17,733
-OK!

763
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:23,333
OK, my sources tell me there's
some deep supernatural shit

764
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:24,367
about to hit the fan, OK.

765
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,100
That's all I know.

766
00:55:26,133 --> 00:55:26,567
That's all I know.

767
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,200
I swear.

768
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:30,033
- All right, you've been
a great help, Stank.

769
00:55:30,067 --> 00:55:32,567
I won't turn you over
to the state this time.

770
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,680
Just keep your facts clean.

771
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,500
- Hey, you got a couple extra
bucks for a pint of blood?

772
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:41,800
-How much?

773
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:45,233
-Oh, shit!

774
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:47,167
You asshole!

775
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,333
-What's next?

776
00:55:48,367 --> 00:55:49,567
-I don't know.

777
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,443
We've got to go back to the
station, work on some back up.

778
00:55:51,467 --> 00:55:52,709
No, we've got to
get some weapons.

779
00:55:52,733 --> 00:55:55,467
We've got to check out
that vampire safe house.

780
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,533
-Wait a minute.

781
00:55:56,567 --> 00:55:58,476
- I know we're not supposed
to be on this case, OK.

782
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:04,067
But until we find out what's
going on, it's you and me, kid.

783
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,300
And we got to be ready.

784
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:06,333
-For what?

785
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,800
-The worst.

786
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:27,500
- Vladimus sent me to
speak with a prisoner.

787
00:56:27,533 --> 00:56:28,533
-Of course.

788
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:35,933
-What's happening?

789
00:56:35,967 --> 00:56:38,100
I need some answers.

790
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:40,667
- Richard, it's is very
different world now.

791
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,500
And the bleeders
want to rule it.

792
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:44,133
Our master Vladimus
needs to know

793
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:47,033
if you're with us or against us.

794
00:56:47,067 --> 00:56:49,300
-How can you be part of this?

795
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:51,467
- We're all just
trying to survive.

796
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,267
-At whose expense?

797
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,200
-We don't have much time.

798
00:56:54,233 --> 00:56:56,500
At dawn, the planets
will align, creating

799
00:56:56,533 --> 00:56:58,400
a total eclipse of the sun.

800
00:56:58,433 --> 00:57:00,567
It only happens once
every 1,000 years,

801
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,267
and that's when our master
will perform the ceremony.

802
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,333
-To do what?

803
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:07,133
-To blot out the sun.

804
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:09,300
To make the world forever night.

805
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:11,167
It's called Maltivore.

806
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,600
-Vampire Armageddon.

807
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:18,433
- And to complete the ceremony,
a virgin must be sacrificed.

808
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:24,700
- Good luck finding one of
those in L.A. The attack.

809
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,767
They were after Mary.

810
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,467
-Yes.

811
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,467
-So why haven't they killed me?

812
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,400
- Vladimus needs you
to be on our side.

813
00:57:32,433 --> 00:57:34,767
He believes that
you're the chosen one.

814
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,500
-Chosen for what?

815
00:57:36,533 --> 00:57:37,600
Midnight snack?

816
00:57:37,633 --> 00:57:41,667
- When you become a vampire,
you lose your humanity.

817
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,233
But you didn't.

818
00:57:43,267 --> 00:57:45,600
Somehow you still
have your soul,

819
00:57:45,633 --> 00:57:48,433
and that's as unnatural
as it gets, hence

820
00:57:48,467 --> 00:57:52,667
making a lot of very
powerful demons nervous.

821
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,567
-This is like a nightmare.

822
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,200
I didn't ask for any of this.

823
00:57:57,233 --> 00:57:58,233
-Didn't you?

824
00:58:01,733 --> 00:58:03,233
You have to understand.

825
00:58:03,267 --> 00:58:04,567
I thought you were dead.

826
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,033
-I was dead.

827
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:08,300
Damn dead.

828
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:10,467
You should know...
You made me this way.

829
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,467
-No, I mean dead dead.

830
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,267
The kind of dead that
you don't come back from.

831
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,600
But you did.

832
00:58:18,633 --> 00:58:22,133
You came back.

833
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:25,567
- I thought I'd
never see you again.

834
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,200
-Here I am.

835
00:58:44,133 --> 00:58:45,133
-Come to me.

836
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:07,067
Now feed.

837
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,100
Feed.

838
00:59:28,433 --> 00:59:29,433
Feed.

839
01:00:13,367 --> 01:00:14,733
-Was it good?

840
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:18,567
-Absolutely.

841
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:27,467
We're clear.

842
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:40,400
-Come with me.

843
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:41,333
-No.

844
01:00:41,367 --> 01:00:42,533
Lexa is my sister.

845
01:00:42,567 --> 01:00:43,576
She's the only
family I have left.

846
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,533
I have to try to convince
her to come with me.

847
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:48,100
It's OK.

848
01:00:48,133 --> 01:00:49,333
Everything will be fine.

849
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:51,267
We'll be together again.

850
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:54,233
-Forever and ever.

851
01:00:54,267 --> 01:00:55,567
-Forever and ever.

852
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,567
-I'll be back with some help.

853
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,600
-Hurry.

854
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:02,500
-Somebody's in trouble.

855
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:06,000
-You will pay for this.

856
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:19,733
-Who's that?

857
01:01:19,767 --> 01:01:22,033
She's cute.

858
01:01:22,067 --> 01:01:23,800
-That's my daughter.

859
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:25,667
-Oh.

860
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:30,200
Well, I can see where she
gets her good looks from.

861
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:31,767
Where is she?

862
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,733
-I lost her two years ago.

863
01:01:33,767 --> 01:01:36,400
-What do you mean?

864
01:01:36,433 --> 01:01:39,167
- She was killed in
the vampire uprising.

865
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:39,800
-Oh, Reeger.

866
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:40,833
I'm sorry.

867
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,267
-Don't be sorry.

868
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,033
Let's just get this thing done.

869
01:01:51,267 --> 01:01:53,167
-Mary.

870
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,267
Mary!

871
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,300
-Freeze, turkey.

872
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,367
-Don't try anything.

873
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,033
These are silver-tipped bullets.

874
01:02:01,067 --> 01:02:02,633
-That only works on werewolves.

875
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:07,733
-Oh.

876
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:08,767
-Look out!

877
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:15,767
-Back off!

878
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,043
You're not going to kill me with
the rest of your bloodsucking

879
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:18,500
buddies, are you?

880
01:02:18,533 --> 01:02:19,133
-Wait a minute.

881
01:02:19,167 --> 01:02:19,833
I'm one of the good guys.

882
01:02:19,867 --> 01:02:22,400
-You expect me to believe that.

883
01:02:22,433 --> 01:02:23,633
-It's the truth.

884
01:02:23,667 --> 01:02:26,133
I'm here for reinforcements.

885
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:27,267
-You ain't leftovers.

886
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,067
I'll see you in hell.

887
01:02:40,433 --> 01:02:41,300
-Where's Mary?

888
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:42,633
-We got separated.

889
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:43,533
What happens now?

890
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:45,500
-It's time to fight back.

891
01:02:45,533 --> 01:02:47,033
- I have been working
on some weapons

892
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:48,667
using ultraviolet light.

893
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,800
- You have weapons and you
haven't been using them?

894
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:53,667
-We deplore violence.

895
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,633
-It's a little late for that.

896
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:57,509
The bleeders are up at
the old Fairbanks mansion

897
01:02:57,533 --> 01:02:59,467
planning the end of the world.

898
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,333
-What are you talking about?

899
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:04,367
- They're about to perform some
sort of a ceremony... Matador,

900
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,533
Maltador, or...

901
01:03:05,567 --> 01:03:05,933
-Maltivore?

902
01:03:05,967 --> 01:03:06,967
-That's it.

903
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,333
- Maltivore is the vampire
word for black dawn.

904
01:03:10,367 --> 01:03:12,767
If it's true,
we're all finished.

905
01:03:16,733 --> 01:03:18,253
- So what are you
going to do about it?

906
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,233
That's what I thought.

907
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:24,267
Are you coming?

908
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,733
-Hey, I'm coming.

909
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:27,067
Wait a minute!

910
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,109
-Hey, we'd better hurry up.

911
01:03:28,133 --> 01:03:28,800
The sun will be up soon.

912
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,133
It's the best time to get them.

913
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:31,533
-What about Lillith?

914
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:33,367
-They're going to kill us all.

915
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,000
- You're beginning
to get the picture.

916
01:03:50,733 --> 01:03:52,700
-Celeste.

917
01:03:52,733 --> 01:03:55,367
- Oh, I'm so glad
I found you two.

918
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,400
-Where's Betty?

919
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:58,467
-We barely got out alive.

920
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,609
- What about Richard
and the others?

921
01:03:59,633 --> 01:04:00,533
The sanctuary?

922
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:01,667
-It's not safe anymore.

923
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,709
But we have another place.

924
01:04:02,733 --> 01:04:03,400
Come on, hurry.

925
01:04:03,433 --> 01:04:05,700
I'll take you.

926
01:04:05,733 --> 01:04:06,733
Come on.

927
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:18,633
Come on, hurry up.

928
01:04:18,667 --> 01:04:19,767
Here she is.

929
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:24,300
A virgin, just like we agreed.

930
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:28,133
-My kind of girl.

931
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:31,233
-How could you betray us?

932
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:32,600
-I had no choice.

933
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:35,100
They took my Betty.

934
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:37,400
- We made her an offer
she couldn't refuse.

935
01:04:37,433 --> 01:04:41,633
- They promised to make
me a full vampire.

936
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:42,733
-Oh, yeah.

937
01:04:42,767 --> 01:04:43,633
About that.

938
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:49,333
I forgot to mention
one little thing.

939
01:04:49,367 --> 01:04:50,733
We don't take anyone over 30.

940
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,033
-What is that?

941
01:05:15,067 --> 01:05:20,600
- This is a 16th century
cross filled with holy water.

942
01:05:20,633 --> 01:05:22,733
- Where do you get
something like that?

943
01:05:22,767 --> 01:05:23,767
-Ebay.

944
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,076
- Are you sure these tunnels
lead into the mansion?

945
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:36,967
-Yeah.

946
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,267
It was on the map
to the stars' homes.

947
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,367
- Maybe we should
call for backup.

948
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,267
-Already tried.

949
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,100
-And?

950
01:05:43,133 --> 01:05:45,100
-Line's busy.

951
01:05:45,133 --> 01:05:46,667
-I really think we should wait.

952
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,467
- You know what the
professor said.

953
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,100
Black dawn.

954
01:05:50,133 --> 01:05:52,167
Well, there's your dawn.

955
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:56,067
We can't let them get to
the blacking out part.

956
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,100
Let's go.

957
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,267
-You've had this coming.

958
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,533
Very long time.

959
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:20,800
-Richard is the chosen one.

960
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:23,067
He will stop you.

961
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:26,500
-I know he'll be back.

962
01:06:26,533 --> 01:06:28,467
I'm counting on it.

963
01:06:42,633 --> 01:06:44,133
-We'd better split up.

964
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:47,300
You go that way, I go this way.

965
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:49,400
- Are you sure this
is a good idea?

966
01:06:49,433 --> 01:06:51,000
-Just stay in contact.

967
01:07:17,067 --> 01:07:19,167
Peters, I found a way in.

968
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,467
Peters.

969
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,033
Peters?

970
01:07:24,067 --> 01:07:25,067
Dammit.

971
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:40,000
- Master, a fresh sample
of the virgin's blood.

972
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,267
-Master, The Book of the Dead.

973
01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:06,367
-Bring forth the virgin.

974
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,733
-Get me the virgin!

975
01:09:35,067 --> 01:09:36,067
-Shit.

976
01:09:39,433 --> 01:09:44,100
-Our world begins!

977
01:09:44,133 --> 01:09:46,400
-Freeze.

978
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:47,800
-Pathetic human.

979
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:50,367
You think you can
kill all of us?

980
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,767
-I don't need to.

981
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,367
Just him.

982
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:57,333
-Protect the Master.

983
01:09:57,367 --> 01:09:59,333
- We're a little
outnumbered here.

984
01:09:59,367 --> 01:10:00,767
-You're a pretty good detective.

985
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:27,667
-Wrong party.

986
01:10:30,633 --> 01:10:32,633
-I told you I'd come back.

987
01:10:41,267 --> 01:10:42,600
- They were going
to sacrifice me.

988
01:10:42,633 --> 01:10:44,567
-You should have got laid.

989
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,533
-Where's Mary and Lindsey?

990
01:10:46,567 --> 01:10:48,500
-They're upstairs in the tower.

991
01:10:48,533 --> 01:10:49,133
-All right.

992
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:49,833
We're on it.

993
01:10:49,867 --> 01:10:52,500
-You still have to get Vladimus.

994
01:10:52,533 --> 01:10:53,533
-Let's go.

995
01:11:06,367 --> 01:11:08,600
- Send these bastards
back to hell!

996
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,700
Help, help!

997
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:17,233
Somebody help us!

998
01:11:17,267 --> 01:11:19,100
-It's the police!

999
01:11:19,133 --> 01:11:21,267
Watch your step.

1000
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,233
Step back away from the door!

1001
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:29,800
You're OK?

1002
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:32,367
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1003
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,733
-Dad?

1004
01:11:34,767 --> 01:11:35,767
-Mary.

1005
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,700
I thought you were dead.

1006
01:11:43,233 --> 01:11:45,033
-Mommy, who's this?

1007
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:50,700
- Um, honey... this
is your grandfather.

1008
01:11:50,733 --> 01:11:52,300
-They call me half pint.

1009
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,100
- Look, I hate interrupt
this family reunion,

1010
01:11:57,133 --> 01:12:00,133
but we're not out
of the fire yet.

1011
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:00,800
-Yeah.

1012
01:12:00,833 --> 01:12:02,633
You stay with them.

1013
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:03,667
I'll be right back.

1014
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,533
- Mommy, he's not
wearing a shirt.

1015
01:12:11,567 --> 01:12:15,100
-It's casual Friday.

1016
01:12:15,133 --> 01:12:16,133
-Oh.

1017
01:12:32,267 --> 01:12:36,633
- More than enough
to buy a new army.

1018
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:37,733
-Just in case.

1019
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:46,433
-Going somewhere?

1020
01:12:46,467 --> 01:12:48,567
- Lexa, you can
still come with us.

1021
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,076
- There are predators
and there are prey.

1022
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,433
And I'm a predator!

1023
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,333
- It's the end of
this world, Richard.

1024
01:13:00,367 --> 01:13:01,767
Join my world.

1025
01:13:04,733 --> 01:13:05,733
-No.

1026
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:22,600
- Last chance to join
the winning team.

1027
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:31,133
I'm tired of games, Richard.

1028
01:13:31,167 --> 01:13:32,167
Feel my true power.

1029
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:47,000
-You've got to be kidding.

1030
01:13:50,767 --> 01:13:51,767
-Hey, ugly.

1031
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,500
-Richard!

1032
01:14:25,467 --> 01:14:28,067
-No!

1033
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,100
No!

1034
01:14:33,433 --> 01:14:34,400
No.

1035
01:14:34,433 --> 01:14:37,133
-Richard, it's OK.

1036
01:14:37,167 --> 01:14:39,600
You gave me back my soul.

1037
01:14:39,633 --> 01:14:41,467
It's OK.

1038
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,433
-Lillith.

1039
01:14:42,467 --> 01:14:45,633
-Forever and ever.

1040
01:14:45,667 --> 01:14:46,667
-Forever and ever.

1041
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:10,767
Forever and ever.

1042
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,333
So here I am at the crossroads

1043
01:15:22,367 --> 01:15:26,433
of my afterlife I don't
know what the future holds,

1044
01:15:26,467 --> 01:15:30,600
but one thing's for sure...
Lexa and some of the bleeders

1045
01:15:30,633 --> 01:15:35,067
are still out there feeding.

1046
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:38,033
Someone has to stop them.

1047
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:39,500
I could use a job.

1048
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:55,167
- Man, I hope you
brought some money.

1049
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,600
-Buy a girl a drink?

1050
01:16:06,633 --> 01:16:08,100
-Sure, sweetheart.

1051
01:16:08,133 --> 01:16:09,400
Whatever you'd like.

1052
01:16:09,433 --> 01:16:11,467
- Looks like drinks are
on the house, boys.

1053
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:05,733
- Hope you brought enough
cash tonight, brother.

1054
01:17:05,767 --> 01:17:06,767
Hold on.

1055
01:17:09,733 --> 01:17:10,733
-Action.

1056
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,600
-Action.

1057
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:29,133
Sorry.

1058
01:17:29,167 --> 01:17:30,067
-Hardcastle was right.

1059
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:33,467
This falls in the
jurisdiction of stecks.

1060
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,800
Sex?

1061
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:35,833
Stecks.

1062
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:42,067
-Rule number two... no survivors.

1063
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:45,067
Rule number three...
You've got to watch out.

1064
01:17:49,267 --> 01:17:51,300
- I told you I'd
come back for you.

1065
01:17:55,733 --> 01:17:57,733
Where's Mary and Lindsey?

1066
01:17:57,767 --> 01:17:58,767
-Action.

1067
01:18:04,433 --> 01:18:05,233
-Whoa.

1068
01:18:05,267 --> 01:18:08,033
It's me.

1069
01:18:08,067 --> 01:18:10,267
Gotta get out of here.

1070
