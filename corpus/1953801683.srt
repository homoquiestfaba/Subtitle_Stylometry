1
00:00:00,391 --> 00:00:02,521
I had big plans that summer,

2
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:04,397
I was going to learn some things.

3
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,630
Ted, we're home.

4
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,415
Teddy!

5
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:50,466
What are you doing in here?
- Nothing!

6
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:54,249
See, that year, 1989,

7
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,395
everything had gotten confusing.

8
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,218
It all started when I danced with
my cousin at her birthday party

9
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,454
and got a hard on.

10
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:01,816
Completely naked?

11
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:04,100
Oh that's
- Oh yeah!

12
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:05,429
And I realized that all the guys

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,343
at school knew things that I didn't.

14
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:11,042
What's wrong with him?

15
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:13,968
He is such a loser!

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,245
They had secret hand signals

17
00:01:16,246 --> 00:01:17,546
and their own code.

18
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:19,579
Come on, let's go guys.

19
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,564
And I was just trying to keep up.

20
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:24,580
Bernie Plotkin was a big help.

21
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,346
He was kind of an expert
on all things sexual.

22
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:28,857
So you wake up

23
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:30,463
and then there is
stuff in your pants.

24
00:01:30,464 --> 00:01:31,170
Yup!

25
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,146
From the dream.

26
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,921
He told me a few things

27
00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:34,822
for a price.

28
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:38,110
He charged a buck
for one of his dad pornos.

29
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:42,017
I had always
assumed that my

30
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:45,138
father would be the one
to teach me this stuff.

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,815
But things changed.

32
00:01:48,705 --> 00:01:49,719
I met someone

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,620
and 

34
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:52,207
we've fallen in love.

35
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:54,865
Oh bullshit,

36
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:55,906
he's an asshole.

37
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:58,190
He doesn't
even know what love is.

38
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:59,123
A horny fucker.

39
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:00,081
He just wanted something tighter

40
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:01,902
he could stick his dick in.

41
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:03,371
Shit!

42
00:02:03,843 --> 00:02:04,753
I've gotta go.

43
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:10,356
But at home,

44
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:12,047
now that my dad was gone,

45
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:13,666
everything was different.

46
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,330
I had to figure it all out
on my own.

47
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:21,922
And I had a lot

48
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:22,823
to learn.

49
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:34,201
Teddy, come on!

50
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:35,502
OK, sorry.

51
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,258
Fluff?

52
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:41,929
Yes fluff, of course fluff.

53
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:43,754
No fluff.

54
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:44,865
Shit!

55
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,880
You are always
forgetting my stuff!

56
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:47,791
It's not fair!

57
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:49,667
I am not Teddy,

58
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:51,154
it was an accident.

59
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:52,646
The babysitter
will get you something.

60
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:54,208
Hannah it's your turn to help.

61
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,574
You finish unpacking.

62
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,757
I'm in the middle
of some stuff.

63
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:58,188
You are not!

64
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:02,456
Who ever heard of a
fluffernutter without fluff.

65
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:04,093
That's called a
peanut butter sandwich

66
00:03:04,094 --> 00:03:05,524
and it is disgusting!

67
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:07,806
Ted, I'm sorry about the fluff.

68
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:09,432
Now please just help me.

69
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:13,436
I need to get on the road.

70
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,166
What the hell!

71
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,320
Guys, please!

72
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:20,677
I'll be gone in just a few minutes

73
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:21,940
then you can
kill each other all you want.

74
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,667
You're just a lazy lardo!

75
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:24,635
Are you kidding me?!
- Just knock it off!

76
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:26,559
Mrs. Kargman?
- Fuck.

77
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,600
Claire

78
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:29,953
Hi sorry to interrupt.

79
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:31,621
Oh, no, no

80
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:32,597
don't be silly,

81
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:34,418
just a little family spat.

82
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:41,207
OK, this is Hannah

83
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:42,989
and this is Teddy.

84
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:44,164
Hi.

85
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:45,931
Hannah

86
00:03:45,932 --> 00:03:47,643
why don't you show
Claire her room?

87
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,684
Fine.

88
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,160
I'm gonna show you your room.

89
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:00,854
Teddy!

90
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:03,457
Teddy, clean that mess up.
Please.

91
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,793
OK Teddy I'm off!

92
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:16,638
Now I want you to try and
behave this weekend, OK?

93
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,622
Mom, I don't need babysitting!

94
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:20,638
Please, I am exhausted.

95
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:21,848
I need a break.

96
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:23,950
Please, let me get
out of here, OK?

97
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:25,804
Mom, I've been
going to sleepovers alone

98
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:26,887
for like a year now.

99
00:04:26,888 --> 00:04:28,838
OK, Teddy please,
just stop, this now.

100
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,739
Claire!

101
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:30,749
Mom!?

102
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,569
Teddy,

103
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,470
listen...

104
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,223
I will be back in 2 days.

105
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:35,371
All right?

106
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,098
Before you even know it, OK.

107
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:37,999
All right.

108
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:38,951
Claire! Oh

109
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:40,525
there you are

110
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:41,956
Claire

111
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:44,372
Teddy is a little worried
about staying home alone.

112
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:45,867
You'll take good care

113
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,438
of my little teddy bear, won't you?

114
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,744
Of course I will!

115
00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:50,565
See, my little baby.

116
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:53,636
Have a good time, OK?

117
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:54,872
I'll see you later.

118
00:04:54,938 --> 00:04:55,838
I love you.

119
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:58,610
I love you too.

120
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:00,523
Have fun baby.

121
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:02,133
Don't worry about a thing

122
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,758
while you are gone.
We'll be fine.

123
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,384
Thank you Claire.

124
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:06,631
Goodbye buddy.

125
00:05:08,347 --> 00:05:10,687
I don't feel so good.

126
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:12,729
Okay.

127
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:20,531
Teddy?

128
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:28,571
One fluffernutter sandwich,

129
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:29,612
at your service.

130
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:31,273
Wow, thanks!

131
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:32,060
Sure!

132
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:34,501
Your mom said that
you love those, so...

133
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:35,737
I mean, she's gone

134
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:38,967
and Hannah won't
come out of her room

135
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:40,658
so you wanna hang out?

136
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:44,507
I just don't feel good.

137
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:47,702
Is

138
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:49,068
is this, normal Ted?

139
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:50,804
You know everybody
hanging out in their rooms

140
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:52,560
not talking to each other?

141
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:53,518
Aha.

142
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,349
Well, I want to have
some fun this weekend.

143
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,403
You gonna help me out?

144
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:57,314
Aha.

145
00:05:58,383 --> 00:05:59,106
All right.

146
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:01,260
You and me we are
going to have some fun.

147
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:03,566
Yeah,

148
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:04,363
Hi,

149
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,404
is Bernie home?

150
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,102
It's Teddy Kargman.

151
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:09,968
OK, thanks.

152
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:14,031
Bernie, Hi

153
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:17,359
look, I need some advice....

154
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:27,630
Hey Claire,
thanks for the sandwich.

155
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:30,427
Decent, but I'll give you some
pointers for next time.

156
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:32,021
Well I'm sorry
it wasn't up to par

157
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:34,155
you'll have to show me
some of your tricks.

158
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:35,131
Want some coke?

159
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,355
I usually have wine with dinner.

160
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,322
You know, European style.

161
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,099
Why didn't anybody
tell me the pizza was here?

162
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:46,520
You want some?

163
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:47,287
There should be a

164
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:49,041
decent white in the fridge.

165
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,479
What are you doing?

166
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,585
Teddy.

167
00:06:52,397 --> 00:06:53,032
Give me this.

168
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,648
Guys!

169
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:57,234
You're such a moron.

170
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:59,484
Why are you wearing
dad's stupid shirt anyway?

171
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,169
Hannah come on,
he's just, being sweet.

172
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,080
No.

173
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:05,158
It's because you like her,
isn't it?

174
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,614
Shut up.

175
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:07,770
He's just horny.

176
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:09,006
Hannah?!

177
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:09,616
Shut up!

178
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:11,177
We're like the same age!

179
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:16,096
Jeez, what a little badass.

180
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:22,237
It's a nice shirt,
whosever it is.

181
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,966
It's mine.

182
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:25,271
I promise.

183
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:28,508
Well it looks nice on you.

184
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,409
Very spiffy.

185
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:32,442
Thanks.

186
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,799
So

187
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:44,933
how about we go to the beach?

188
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:46,476
Beach?

189
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:48,345
Yeah. I'm supposed to meet
a friend there tomorrow.

190
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:49,321
It will be fun.

191
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:54,409
I want you to come.

192
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:57,783
You and me

193
00:07:57,784 --> 00:07:58,684
at the beach?

194
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,106
Yeah!

195
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:08,916
Teddy!

196
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:10,614
What are you doing up?

197
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:11,785
I

198
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:13,027
I just

199
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,293
Were you watching me Teddy?

200
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:18,195
What?

201
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:20,374
Just now, you weren't
snooping were you?

202
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,109
No.

203
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,010
Jeez.

204
00:09:26,923 --> 00:09:29,718
It's OK.
It's perfectly natural.

205
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,949
I'm really excited
about tomorrow Ted.

206
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,699
It's supposed to be
a beautiful day.

207
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,600
Sweet dreams.

208
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:41,530
You have a girlfriend?

209
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:42,431
No.

210
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:43,554
No?

211
00:09:43,555 --> 00:09:44,864
You mean there aren't any
little girls

212
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:47,103
around the neighborhood
that you're interested in

213
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:47,926
or, at school?

214
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:49,292
Oh, well

215
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:51,792
I haven't really ever

216
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:52,703
gotten

217
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:54,252
to

218
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,188
I haven't even thought

219
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:56,704
about having a girlfriend

220
00:09:56,705 --> 00:09:57,456
really.

221
00:09:57,457 --> 00:09:58,441
Really?

222
00:09:58,442 --> 00:09:59,872
Little stud like you.

223
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:02,184
Well...

224
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:02,946
I mean

225
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:04,587
the kids at school
aren't exactly,

226
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:05,488
very

227
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,197
well nice to me.

228
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:08,663
What?

229
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:10,004
I'm not exactly

230
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:11,474
the coolest kid around.

231
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:12,540
Is what I'm saying.

232
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,621
That is unbelievable.

233
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,328
I need to go have a word
with those children.

234
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,540
Cool! Well I bet your
teammates loved you for that.

235
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,319
Well

236
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,220
not the guy

237
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:41,435
that

238
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:42,710
had the concussion

239
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:43,792
but, everyone knows

240
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:45,041
You gave him a concussion?

241
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:46,287
By accident, OK?

242
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,804
Wow you must be

243
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:52,492
able to throw that ball really hard.

244
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:53,818
Yeah.

245
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,165
Cool.

246
00:10:57,554 --> 00:10:58,746
I've also won

247
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:00,697
a couple participation medals

248
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:03,322
for the games we haven't won.

249
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:05,003
Very nice.

250
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:07,048
Do you play very often?

251
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:09,100
Well

252
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,436
the week after school starts

253
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,257
I'm actually having a game.

254
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,874
That's cool.

255
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:15,320
Are you inviting me?

256
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:17,968
If you wanna come to that.

257
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:20,172
Yeah I would love to!

258
00:11:20,186 --> 00:11:23,044
I think it would be a lot of
fun watching you play.

259
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:23,945
Cool.

260
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:26,143
Wanna go swim?

261
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:28,514
Come on, we're at the beach
we gotta go swim.

262
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:29,415
Come on!

263
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:30,869
No.

264
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,227
What do you mean no?

265
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:33,991
Come on show me your moves!

266
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:35,124
Come on, let's go!

267
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,878
I don't like the ocean.

268
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,632
What do you mean
you don't like the ocean?

269
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,526
How could you not
like the ocean?

270
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:41,522
You're missing out!

271
00:11:41,523 --> 00:11:42,961
I'm going without you!

272
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:00,061
Claire?

273
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:02,686
Claire, hey!

274
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:08,771
Brad? Oh going to
swim with Teddy there.

275
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:11,999
Oh yeah. - He can swim,
but he won't come down.

276
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,900
Ted come on!

277
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,469
Come on, hurry!

278
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,240
Hey, who is this guy?

279
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,733
Teddy, Brad, Brad, Teddy.

280
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:29,639
What's up Ted?

281
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,330
Put it up top, high five!

282
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:32,423
Low fi...

283
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,410
All right.

284
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:37,449
Teddy is a little shy.

285
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,880
A little shy?

286
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:39,506
What's going on,

287
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:40,951
you having fun today buddy?

288
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:42,237
Yeah I guess.

289
00:12:42,238 --> 00:12:43,331
You guess?

290
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:44,909
Well don't guess about safety.

291
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,869
It's pretty important.

292
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:48,253
You guys gonna
go out swimming?

293
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:49,419
I've been trying to
get him to go out there.

294
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,020
Actually I just wanna go home.

295
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:54,198
Teddy, we just got here.

296
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,662
I just don't feel good.

297
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:56,768
Teddy?

298
00:12:57,336 --> 00:12:58,740
Wow, looks like
you've got your hands full.

299
00:12:58,741 --> 00:12:59,519
Right.

300
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,557
Well I gotta get rolling, but

301
00:13:00,558 --> 00:13:01,581
I'll see you later on tonight.

302
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,337
Yeah absolutely.

303
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:14,362
Teddy?

304
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,460
Teddy?!

305
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:41,891
He totally was watching me

306
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:43,783
like put lotion
on my legs last night.

307
00:13:43,784 --> 00:13:44,794
Lotion on your legs?

308
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:45,742
Wow, that must
have made his day.

309
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:46,685
And actually the...

310
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:48,141
Oh, hey, we got a visitor.

311
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:48,548
Oh...

312
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:49,449
Hey, aha.

313
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,575
Teddy.

314
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:53,631
Why don't you come in
and say hi to Brad?

315
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:55,130
Hey Teddy.

316
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:01,168
Ted, let me
ask you a question.

317
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:02,197
Who is the most

318
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:03,710
attractive girl you've ever seen?

319
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:04,525
What?

320
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:06,138
I mean face to face.

321
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:07,143
Who, who is the most

322
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:09,159
gorgeous girl you've ever met?

323
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:10,198
Can I guess?

324
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:11,855
Can I... I got a guess.

325
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:13,235
Is she in this room right now?

326
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:14,229
Is she sitting in this room?

327
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,517
Don't be silly.

328
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,422
And if she is I gotta tell you

329
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,848
Teddy you got excellent taste.

330
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:20,185
You really do.

331
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:22,080
Man, if I was your age,

332
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:24,226
and I had a babysitter like this

333
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:27,803
what would I do

334
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:29,471
legs like that I mean....

335
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:32,400
Brad, stop.

336
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:34,352
What?
It's just a compliment.

337
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:35,539
I think you need another cocktail.

338
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,946
Because I haven't had enough?

339
00:14:41,192 --> 00:14:45,677
Yeah, see Claire we just need
to loosen you up a little bit.

340
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,614
Get out of my father's chair!

341
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:50,181
This is my dad's chair!

342
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,082
Get out!

343
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:52,558
All right man, take it easy.

344
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,483
This is my house!

345
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:54,213
All right!

346
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:55,088
Jesus.

347
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:56,129
Ted?!

348
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:57,030
Hey.

349
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:58,277
Oh my...

350
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,311
Oh my God, are you OK?

351
00:15:00,312 --> 00:15:01,482
Yes.

352
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:03,046
Teddy?!

353
00:15:04,426 --> 00:15:05,120
Teddy?

354
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,845
It's OK.

355
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:14,903
It's OK.

356
00:15:24,742 --> 00:15:25,847
Teddy?

357
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,470
Teddy?

358
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,025
Morning.

359
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:38,304
Your mom will be home soon.

360
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:47,047
Teddy, I'm...

361
00:15:47,664 --> 00:15:48,833
I'm sorry, if I have

362
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,589
confused you in any way or

363
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:51,834
made you think that I...

364
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:53,200
I love you!

365
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:26,908
No you don't.

366
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,683
Goodbye Teddy.

367
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:10,556
The End

368
