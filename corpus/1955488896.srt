1
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,795
Honey, jiggle the handle.

2
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:04,914
Can't we get that fixed?

3
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,614
After our down-payment,
we've got about eight dollars left.

4
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,720
All right, then we'll jiggle.

5
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:16,221
Mark.
Whoa, Mark.

6
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,973
- We have to go to work.
- I am working.

7
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,669
Are you sure
you want to do this?

8
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,770
I never realized living
in an apartment was so inhibiting.

9
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,870
All these walls are ours.

10
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,766
Makes me want to go out
and buy handcuffs.

11
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:39,558
- I love this house.
- Oh, I can't believe we got in.

12
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,600
There was only a five-minute
dip in the market.

13
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:44,072
And you were right on top of it.

14
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:46,390
- You know what I want to do?
- What?

15
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:49,591
I want to buy one of those big,
vulgar televisions.

16
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,145
Oh, yeah, and those tacky,
pink flamingos for the lawn.

17
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:54,946
Are those pink flamingos deductible?

18
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:56,952
We can deduct
that shit out of everything.

19
00:03:56,953 --> 00:04:01,291
Oh, oh, Mark, oh...

20
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,915
- Oh, rats.
- What?

21
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,316
Well, these are all postmarked
three weeks ago.

22
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:16,624
Did you call the post office?

23
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,855
Yes. I called the post office.
I sent forms,

24
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:22,256
I sacrificed small animals
in front of the mailbox.

25
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:25,621
- Who do you know in New Jersey?
- I do not know. Let me see.

26
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,983
- Is it an old girlfriend?
- Could be.

27
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:31,418
Oh, wait.
It's my cousin Fred.

28
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:33,367
You never mentioned a "Fred".

29
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:35,768
Oh yeah, sorry.
"Ever Ready Freddy"? Come on.

30
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:40,145
Hey, guess what? He and his wife
want to spend their vacation with us.

31
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:41,897
That sounds fun. When?

32
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:44,550
Today.

33
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:54,263
Are you sure they wouldn't be
more comfortable in a hotel?

34
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:57,270
Jessie...
It's just house guests.

35
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:58,841
It'll be fun.

36
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:02,042
Bye.

37
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:06,409
Oh, I do not know, Mark.
It sounds like a disaster to me.

38
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:08,496
Oh, come on, Wes,
we're talking five days.

39
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:13,045
Yeah? Chernobyl only took 5 minutes, pal,
and it didn't come into LAX at rush hour.

40
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:14,164
This is family.

41
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:15,765
- Good morning, Pepie.
- Good morning, Mark.

42
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:18,259
- Has the Grindle meeting started yet?
- Just now.

43
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,660
I give it three minutes.

44
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,773
- What are you talking about?
- Markisson is going to woof it.

45
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:25,765
- Busted his ass on this.
- Oh yeah?

46
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:29,216
Right now he is asking everybody
to turn to page 6 in their prospectus...

47
00:05:29,223 --> 00:05:31,114
I changed my mind.
One minute.

48
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,900
- What's wrong with page 6? Mark?
- Morning Lory, copy those, please.

49
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:35,601
Mark?

50
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:38,693
Right now he is suggesting a major
investment in Slaughter Security.

51
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,892
- So?
- So, Grindle caught his second wife...

52
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:43,393
in the merger mode
with one of their junior executives.

53
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:45,263
- Forget it!
- Bob, I'm sorry.

54
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:47,064
Now I know we can
work something out here.

55
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:49,781
- We can explore...
- Nobody explores with my ass, Brooks.

56
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,282
Bring around my car.

57
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:52,228
Bob, please.

58
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,055
12 percent growth with companies
that don't sleep with my wife.

59
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,042
It is a simple thing to ask.

60
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:00,670
- I can get you that, Mr. Grindle.
- Who the hell are you?

61
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:03,371
- Mark Bannister, sir.
- He's one of our brightest, Bob.

62
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:05,348
Now I know, sir, Martensen
was somewhat adventurous.

63
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:09,556
But I guarantee you I can build you
a portfolio that's not only conservative,

64
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:12,857
but aggressive.

65
00:06:13,034 --> 00:06:15,737
You'll be earning 14%,
in three months.

66
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:16,954
14?

67
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:23,821
Okay, last chance. Amaze me.

68
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:28,656
I want your suggestions for a
new portfolio on my desk by closing...

69
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:34,762
I can't believe you want to
get in bed with Bob Grindle.

70
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:36,111
I'm not going to wind up like Markisson.

71
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:39,940
- And Croft and Gervitz...
- I am in complete control.

72
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:46,424
Jacob, do you want a timeout?
Go sit in the car and wait for me.

73
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,411
Excuse me, what's your
secret summer fantasy?

74
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:50,946
Chloroform.

75
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,121
A date with Tom Cruise.

76
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:55,729
A date with Tom Cruise...

77
00:06:56,412 --> 00:07:00,474
Enemy space people
come down in this big space ship

78
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:02,875
and eat my mom and dad.

79
00:07:02,895 --> 00:07:05,095
What's your secret summer fantasy?

80
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:07,285
If you've got a question,
Los Angeles, let me know.

81
00:07:07,297 --> 00:07:08,680
I'll find the answer.

82
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:10,391
- Karen?
- That was Jessica Bannister,

83
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:13,541
our question girl.
Thanks, Jessica.

84
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:18,194
Coming up next,
some hot ideas on how to stay cool.

85
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:19,195
Clear.

86
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:26,886
Oh, Jessie?

87
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:30,791
Hi Russel, what's up?

88
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:37,879
I'm... I'm thinking about trying you out
on the Eight o'Clock Report.

89
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:39,676
That's great!

90
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:43,475
But it's a harder news hour, so we'll
have to toughen your image a little.

91
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:45,976
Oh, I can do that.
I think I can work on that.

92
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:48,977
- I'd like to go over some questions.
- I can do that.

93
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,072
What?

94
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:55,696
I can't believe I put off Russel Fenn,

95
00:07:55,697 --> 00:07:57,997
when he wanted to talk to me
about getting me my big break.

96
00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:01,093
I'm sorry, I just wanted us to make the
in-person airport gesture.

97
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,986
I know you didn't mean it,
it's okay, I'm fine.

98
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:03,887
Thank you.

99
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,770
Wait till you get a hold of this guy
he used to have girls hanging all over him.

100
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,422
Is that him?

101
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:12,044
No.

102
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,350
Here comes a good-looking guy.
Is this him?

103
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:20,051
No, he's too young.

104
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:24,742
- Well, you look that young. You do.
- Well, thank you.

105
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:39,887
Fred?

106
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:42,149
- Pudge?
- Pudge?

107
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:49,698
- Hi. How are you?
- God, it's great to see you.

108
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:55,512
- It's my wife, Bernice.
- Bernie.

109
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:58,213
- Hi. Hello.
- Hi. Oh, we're family.

110
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:01,195
You know, I've heard
so much about you.

111
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:04,356
- Hi there, I'm Jessie.
- Hi.

112
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:07,827
She looks just like a movie star,
doesn't she?

113
00:09:07,828 --> 00:09:12,480
- Much better. You see our TV's...
- Honey they don't want to hear about our TV.

114
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:14,675
Tell them the big news.

115
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:17,423
- We're uh...
- Pregnant!

116
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:19,767
That's great, congratulations.

117
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,968
Well, we do have something
to celebrate then.

118
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:23,338
The TV station
that Jessie works for

119
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,739
is just about to give her
a very big promotion.

120
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,316
And Mark got a major assignment
this morning.

121
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:30,247
I just got canned.

122
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:33,360
Let's get the luggage.

123
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:35,065
- Oh yeah, there's another one.
- I got it.

124
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:37,766
The decorative lid.
They were out of zebra.

125
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:41,305
Whoa, what have you got here,
bowling balls?

126
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:42,206
Uh, yeah.

127
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:58,060
Yes, wait.
Move everybody out.

128
00:09:58,061 --> 00:10:00,731
That's the one,
move everybody out!

129
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:05,757
Baby, you made it.
Yeah you did, little one.

130
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:08,893
Come on, boy. Come on.

131
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:12,394
Did your little ears explode?

132
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:14,570
Fred, you didn't
mention anything about a cat.

133
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:17,358
Scruffy Bannister,
meet your cousins.

134
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:20,324
Mark and Jessie.

135
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:25,964
Oh no, no, no.
It's an inexpensive dress really...

136
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,959
- You're okay, aren't you?
- No.

137
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,649
Is this terrible heat bothering you?

138
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,350
You don't look so good, Baby.

139
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,901
So, Fred. What did you do
before you got laid off?

140
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:51,863
I worked in a
sewage treatment plant, Pudge.

141
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:53,999
You know, the best part
about that whole job was

142
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,500
that I would keep any goodies
that came down the pipes.

143
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:58,651
Sounds, uh, great.

144
00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:03,952
Yeah, one time I found a genuine
snakeskin wallet with $80 in it.

145
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,522
Had to clean it up though.

146
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:10,678
I can't believe this traffic.

147
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:14,766
- Oh my God, Scruffy's going on the run.
- Don't let him get under our seat.

148
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:16,089
God, he looks nauseous.

149
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,990
What the hell?

150
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,291
I'm so sorry, Scruffy's never
been carsick before.

151
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:23,492
It's in my ear.

152
00:11:23,493 --> 00:11:26,093
Look, the windows are stuck,
he has puked...

153
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:31,091
I can't believe that that stomach
could hold so much.

154
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:33,592
A little Club Soda
will take that right out.

155
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:38,893
Go play, hon.

156
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,467
Oh, earth tones.
Hides the dirt.

157
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:53,132
Well.
Welcome to L.A.

158
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:56,338
- Yeah, it's...
- What?

159
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,639
- Nothing.
- No, no, no, no, no. What?

160
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,640
It's a little small.

161
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:04,556
- Smaller than we pictured.
- Awfully small.

162
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,061
Come on.
I'll show you your room.

163
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:09,948
Well, here we are.

164
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,584
Bernice?
Is this okay?

165
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,815
Oh sure. I mean I don't mind
sleeping on a... tofu...

166
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:25,116
if the baby doesn't.

167
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:31,137
I cannot believe you gave them
our bedroom, Mark!

168
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:37,182
- Our little haven of privacy.
- I'm sorry. But she is pregnant after all.

169
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:39,922
It's obviously been
a little rough on Fred too.

170
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:42,609
I don't know,
maybe this was a bad idea.

171
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:44,549
You see the guy in there?
He's a wreck!

172
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,550
Like some sort of pod-version
of the Fred I grew up with.

173
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:53,694
- Mark, it is only for five days.
- That's right, it is.

174
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:56,967
And they are trying to be nice.
I mean Fred gave us these watches.

175
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,177
Cartiers, I can't believe
he could afford them,

176
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,578
he just lost his job
fishing stuff out of the sewer.

177
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:14,366
I'm sorry we lost touch like that,
you know?

178
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:15,984
- Hey!
- What?

179
00:13:16,185 --> 00:13:17,785
"Polar Bear Squad"

180
00:13:17,993 --> 00:13:20,489
- Okay.
- Ready?

181
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:31,490
All right.
Can't run from them forever.

182
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,657
What?

183
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:48,253
Well, we're family, right?

184
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:50,789
So I'm just going to
come on out and ask you.

185
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,411
Your nose.
How much did it cost?

186
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:56,590
- What?
- Oh, come on.

187
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:58,991
I saw that nose in Cosmo.

188
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,651
Yeah, I know you all do it out here,
that's fine.

189
00:14:01,752 --> 00:14:04,052
Bernice, I did not have my nose done.

190
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:06,369
Right.
Sorry.

191
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,700
You don't have to be ashamed of me, Hon.

192
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:13,501
It's only the trained eye of a beautician
that can see that.

193
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:18,127
You know, we got
this great guy in Trenton, Dr. Nick.

194
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:19,828
I've been thinking
of getting it done myself.

195
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:23,880
Honestly, maybe just a little bob, you know,
something to lift my eyes up, show my teeth.

196
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,450
Cute.
Excuse me one second.

197
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:28,803
Yeah, my cousin Ronda
went to Dr. Nick.

198
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:32,204
Got a free set of Ginsu knives
and her old nose in a jar of formaldehyde.

199
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:34,564
- I'll get us a couple of fresh ones.
- Okey-dokey.

200
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:37,339
I think I know
what's wrong with Fred.

201
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,240
Hey Pudge, remember
the Oboikski twins?

202
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:42,405
"Pudge"?
What is this "Pudge" deal?

203
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:43,906
- Why does he call you "Pudge"?
- Nothing.

204
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:46,218
- Why do you call him "Pudge"?
- Nothing.

205
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,393
Nothing.

206
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:52,580
- Is that you, sweetie?
- Yes.

207
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:55,181
- Oh my God!
- Hey Pudge.

208
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:58,211
Horizontal stripes...

209
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,120
Which one are you, Fred?

210
00:15:00,121 --> 00:15:03,021
- I believe I'm off the camera here.
- See him blow the thing in my face.

211
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:07,522
- How many reels of the stuff did you bring?
- A couple dozen.

212
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:10,623
You're a barrel of laughs.

213
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:14,366
Hey.

214
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:21,967
I'm sorry.
My God, did you ever do anything but eat?

215
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:24,332
Well apparently not.

216
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,151
You know when you told me
that you were big for your age,

217
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:31,452
I thought you meant you were tall.

218
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:38,834
- Oh, God, what are you doing?
- Mark you have breasts.

219
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:40,883
Oh, it's a game we used to play.

220
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,491
Macy's Thanksgiving Parade.

221
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,015
I'm going to get something to drink.
All right?

222
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,658
Grab a snack while you're there.

223
00:16:39,356 --> 00:16:42,369
All right.
Strike three, he's out of there.

224
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,770
Hey Pudge.
Never lost that old pitching arm, huh?

225
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,988
Rise and shine, lazy bones.
We got a big day ahead of us.

226
00:16:55,336 --> 00:16:56,436
We do?

227
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:05,633
Hey, watch the vulva.

228
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:11,895
- It's not working.
- Stop jiggling, I'm kind of gassy.

229
00:17:11,922 --> 00:17:14,422
- Fred, he's going to drop her.
- No more. I feel sick.

230
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:21,806
Graumann's Chinese.
I always wanted to eat here.

231
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:26,636
Joan Crawford. She used to beat the kids
with like coat hangers. Come on.

232
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:32,528
Oh, Fred.
You're pressing on my prenatal boobs.

233
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:42,608
Come on, squeeze in, squeeze in.
All right, everybody say "trick".

234
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:48,392
Hon, you got the traveler's checks?

235
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:51,906
You put them in your pocket this morning.
I watched you.

236
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:59,958
- Did you call the traveler's check people?
- Their machine said they're on vacation.

237
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:01,507
They'll be back after labor day.

238
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:05,494
You know I told him not to buy them
from some guy in the Kmart parking lot.

239
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,495
Good morning.

240
00:18:07,096 --> 00:18:09,296
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

241
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:11,491
What's this?

242
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,044
It is an itinerary.

243
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:16,045
You know Jessie and I aren't going to be
able to see everything with you guys.

244
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:18,405
And we don't want you
to miss any of the hot spots.

245
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,671
Probably take you the rest of your vacation
just to see all of that.

246
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:26,032
Geez, there's a lot of great stuff on here.
But we're broke.

247
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:29,046
Thanks anyway.

248
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:32,616
- Here.
- No, no, no, Mark. No, no.

249
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:34,317
- Oh Fred, come on.
- I couldn't, Mark, I couldn't.

250
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:35,018
Fred...

251
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:38,899
We'd rather spend the rest of our vacation
just sitting right here.

252
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:41,642
- We not insist.
- Take my car.

253
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:52,904
Ah, yes.

254
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:54,724
You know something?

255
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:57,125
That was the best $300
we ever invested.

256
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,067
Mark?

257
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:01,668
When do your cousins get back?

258
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:04,455
Not for several hours.

259
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:16,026
Forget it. Yes.

260
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,399
Jessa?

261
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:21,405
Oh shit, that's my sister.

262
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:23,706
- Oh, no, no!
- It's my sister.

263
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:28,472
- Honey my clothes, hurry.
- I'll get rid of her.

264
00:20:28,473 --> 00:20:29,773
The pants, the pants.

265
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:33,515
Okay. Just tell her we're not here.

266
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:35,355
Jessa!

267
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:46,943
- Claudia, this is not a good time.
- Kaddir kicked me out!

268
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,857
Jessa!

269
00:20:57,927 --> 00:21:00,302
So then Kaddir didn't actually
kick you out of the house.

270
00:21:00,303 --> 00:21:01,703
That is a matter of opinion.

271
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:03,608
Let's put it this way:
does he even know you're gone?

272
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:06,274
He barely knows I'm alive.
He cut my allowance.

273
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:08,281
He cut her allowance, Honey.

274
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:10,782
To what?
$9000 a month?

275
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,525
Makes me drive his
old Jaguar.

276
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:14,559
You know Claudia, some people
have worse problems.

277
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:17,149
- Like who?
- Like people who don't have cars.

278
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:18,326
Who cares about them?

279
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:20,579
Yes, hello.
Hi, Kaddir.

280
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:23,113
Yes, salom back at you.
Uh-huh.

281
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,022
- He found your note.
- I won't talk to him.

282
00:21:25,144 --> 00:21:28,597
Right, yeah. She's...
He just wanted to know if you were here.

283
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:30,398
- Why?
- Why?

284
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:33,768
To let you know
he canceled your credit cards.

285
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,489
What?
That Middle Eastern maggot.

286
00:21:36,615 --> 00:21:38,404
- Okay. He wants to talk to you.
- He can talk to my lawyer.

287
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:39,805
The nerve of that towel-head.

288
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,591
Oh, yes, she is very upset
about your little love spat, Kaddir.

289
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,092
Right, I...
Uh-huh.

290
00:21:44,256 --> 00:21:47,217
He says he will forget everything, if you
just go home and fix dinner for him.

291
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,962
Oh grind some glass, Ayatollah!

292
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,935
Jessie, turn down the TV,
would you, babe?

293
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:51,836
- Give me that phone.
- No. No.

294
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:55,037
- Kaddir, she's too grief-stricken right now.
- Give it to me, Mark. Hand over...

295
00:21:56,023 --> 00:22:00,032
Hello Kaddir. No you listen.
I cannot live on that.

296
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,033
I cannot live on that.

297
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,597
Do not speak Farsi to me, Kaddir.
Stop it.

298
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,825
All right, that's it.
That is it!

299
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,026
- I want a...
- ...don't say it!

300
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:12,027
- I want a...
- ...nice Dega Painting in the bathroom

301
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:13,328
- I want...
- ...don't!

302
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:15,029
A divorce.

303
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:24,552
- Honey, wait. Just wait.
- She said the D-word again, Jessie.

304
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:27,453
- Yeah, but she didn't mean it this time.
- Bullshit. She means it every time.

305
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:29,319
She is going to a hotel, right?

306
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:31,181
Jessie, no, we are not taking her in.

307
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:32,048
Oh come on, Mark.

308
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:33,349
If you can have
your idiot cousin stay with us

309
00:22:33,356 --> 00:22:35,263
then we can certainly
take in my poor sister

310
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,464
who has been thrown out on the street
without a nickle.

311
00:22:37,545 --> 00:22:40,937
Jessa? You wouldn't happen to have
any good Scotch, would you?

312
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:57,297
Put it over here.

313
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:00,331
A little more this way.

314
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:09,354
- A couple of days, Claudia, that's it.
- As if I wanted to live in a garret.

315
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:14,503
Now madam, if you need anything else
don't hesitate... to get it yourself.

316
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:16,069
Get out.

317
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,143
I missed you.

318
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:30,497
Mark?

319
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:34,098
How anybody with half a brain...

320
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:38,824
...could drop a whole day's
worth of film into the La Brea Tar Pits...

321
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:41,386
Stop with the eeking.

322
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,987
You get hit by Shamu once
you think you're a porpoise.

323
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:47,212
Jessa?

324
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,769
Could you go ahead?
I don't want to strain my uterus any more.

325
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:12,815
I didn't know anybody's eyes
could be that red.

326
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,516
Boy, those are bulging out.

327
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:17,078
Well what was I supposed to think?
They looked insane.

328
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:20,079
We're not insane.
We're from New Jersey.

329
00:24:20,908 --> 00:24:22,387
Yeah, the Garden State.

330
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:32,210
Deja-vu.
You two have the same nose.

331
00:24:32,324 --> 00:24:34,724
They must have had a
two-for-one special, huh?

332
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:36,125
What?

333
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:38,341
You know.
At the chop-shop.

334
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,750
I told that butcher
not do make it too perfect.

335
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:43,616
Oh no, wait honey,
he didn't make it too perfect.

336
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:45,600
She just has some
bizarre nose fetish.

337
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:48,303
See, he left one nostril
a little bit bigger than the other.

338
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:50,107
I had a deviated septum,
I had to get it fixed.

339
00:24:50,108 --> 00:24:51,108
Excuse me.

340
00:24:51,578 --> 00:24:52,722
You know, I was thinking.

341
00:24:52,723 --> 00:24:56,823
Maybe I can interview you two for this new
budget beauty book I'm trying to write.

342
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,101
I'm going to call it
"Pretty for Peanuts".

343
00:24:59,102 --> 00:25:01,402
- Get it?
- Play with the cat, Bernice.

344
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:05,663
- Where is Scruffy? Scruffy Bannister?
- He was in the kitchen.

345
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:07,864
It's too perky.
I hate perky.

346
00:25:07,865 --> 00:25:10,565
No, it's perfect.
I didn't say perky, I said perfect.

347
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,343
Dear God,

348
00:25:30,344 --> 00:25:34,144
here lies the body of
Scruffy Bannister,

349
00:25:34,245 --> 00:25:36,745
our beloved companion.

350
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:40,298
$42 worth of angelfish.

351
00:25:40,446 --> 00:25:43,190
This is ridiculous.
Why don't we just flush it down the toilet?

352
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:44,891
Not our toilet.

353
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:50,930
Why? Why do you always
take the good ones?

354
00:25:57,314 --> 00:26:00,427
Sleep well, little prince.

355
00:26:24,026 --> 00:26:26,696
Mark.
There's something in there.

356
00:26:27,497 --> 00:26:28,497
Mark.

357
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:37,545
God.

358
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,233
Honey, Honey! Look!
The dead cat! It's alive!

359
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:14,953
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

360
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:19,738
Whoever is down there,
I'm carrying an Uzi.

361
00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:23,891
Scruffy.

362
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,196
Oh, baby.
It's a miracle.

363
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:33,297
Mom is so sorry for burying you alive.

364
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:35,498
Yes she is.

365
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:38,249
P.U.
Is that you or this kitchen?

366
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:45,019
No, no, Anthony listen to me.
Forget Tropic Core, okay?

367
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,459
Orange juice stock isn't worth a shit
after the cold and flu season.

368
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:49,904
Also I noticed the collar
on TNT is coming down,

369
00:27:49,905 --> 00:27:51,805
I want a thousand shares
once it hits Bernice.

370
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:53,548
Yeah, what?

371
00:27:53,949 --> 00:27:56,749
I'm sorry, no.
Once it's 99. Yes, thank you.

372
00:27:57,287 --> 00:27:58,527
Um, Mark?

373
00:27:58,828 --> 00:28:01,428
Stark wants to see an update
on the Grindle portfolio.

374
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:02,809
Oh, yes.

375
00:28:07,075 --> 00:28:08,676
- Wait a second, pal.
- What?

376
00:28:08,677 --> 00:28:09,777
You're shedding.

377
00:28:10,097 --> 00:28:12,781
Oh, Jesus.
It's Felix the Rat.

378
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,559
You know something?
I opened a can of peaches last night,

379
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,960
there was cat hair inside of it.

380
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,961
I've been coughing up furballs
for the last two nights.

381
00:28:17,977 --> 00:28:19,940
So when do you get rid
of these people?

382
00:28:21,052 --> 00:28:22,143
Today.

383
00:28:22,173 --> 00:28:24,001
Oh listen,
give me another hug.

384
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:24,722
You know what?

385
00:28:24,723 --> 00:28:27,523
When the baby comes, we're going to
have to all come out and visit you again.

386
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,627
Or pictures. You know pictures are worth
a thousand words.

387
00:28:30,678 --> 00:28:33,853
...a little baby camera on his shoulders
during the birthing process.

388
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:35,754
But I'm going to cover up
all my unmentionables...

389
00:28:35,775 --> 00:28:38,647
Oh, please do, please, honey, yeah.
Bye Bye.

390
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,569
I had so much fun, oh my God.
I'm going to miss everything...

391
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:45,651
- I know this wasn't easy for you guys...
- Oh, no. It wasn't... Come on.

392
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:47,952
No, Bernice can be a little handful.

393
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,834
Listen, you're going to have to
come out and visit us.

394
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:51,235
We will.
Really, we will.

395
00:28:51,236 --> 00:28:52,236
I'm going to
show you the Turnpike,

396
00:28:52,237 --> 00:28:54,537
it's beautiful like
in the spring and fall.

397
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:56,217
- I can't think of anything...
- I'm going to miss you.

398
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:58,218
Hey, Fred, come here
and say goodbye.

399
00:28:58,228 --> 00:29:00,044
Go, hon, goodbye.

400
00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:01,145
All right, Bernice,
you're going to be late, honey.

401
00:29:01,146 --> 00:29:03,046
- You take care, honey.
- I will.

402
00:29:07,648 --> 00:29:10,648
- I'm on... I'm on the ground.
- Honey!

403
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:13,250
Don't move your head.
Don't move your head, Bernice.

404
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,251
- Honey, are you all right?
- Wait, wait, don't touch her.

405
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:17,342
Quick, check and see
if anything fell out.

406
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,582
Oh, God,
I'm going to have a flat baby.

407
00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:21,326
I'm going to call my doctor.

408
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:26,027
No. No LA quacks. I need
my real doctor. Call Dr. Jack Penix.

409
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:29,218
Oh, my God,
oh my God!

410
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:32,519
I can feel the insides exploding.
I know what I'm doing.

411
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:37,736
Yes, Trenton, New Jersey,
for a Dr. Jack Penix.

412
00:29:38,314 --> 00:29:39,818
With an X!

413
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:45,094
Don't touch me.
Get away.

414
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:46,715
Where are you going?

415
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:51,281
He said we need to get her to the
nearest bed as quickly as possible.

416
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,740
Okay. Okay, that's fine.

417
00:29:54,868 --> 00:29:57,039
No Mark. it isn't fine.
She has to stay here.

418
00:29:57,217 --> 00:29:59,222
Well yes,
of course she'll stay here.

419
00:29:59,787 --> 00:30:03,096
- How long?
- For the rest of her pregnancy.

420
00:30:03,097 --> 00:30:04,397
- No...
- No!

421
00:30:05,332 --> 00:30:08,219
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.
- Oh God, oh God, oh God.

422
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,415
I lost all feeling in my womb.

423
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:12,516
Here.

424
00:30:12,884 --> 00:30:17,158
How am I supposed to
stay like this for six months?

425
00:30:17,176 --> 00:30:19,350
Oh, this is just stupid. I'm going to
go get my doctor, Bernice.

426
00:30:19,394 --> 00:30:23,055
No! Never. I need a man of science,
not some ass-lifter.

427
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,786
Whatever we do
has to real cheap.

428
00:30:25,877 --> 00:30:30,356
Since I lost my job, no...
medical coverage.

429
00:30:38,614 --> 00:30:41,375
Hi, Mr. Bannister.
Want to bounce?

430
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:43,437
No Katie.
There are laws.

431
00:30:43,702 --> 00:30:46,401
C.K., how many times did I tell you
not to play with dolls?

432
00:30:46,402 --> 00:30:47,625
Come on, go watch your sister.

433
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,642
Dale?

434
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:51,943
So what's the problem, Bannister?
Espresso machine down again?

435
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,351
No, No, no.

436
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:55,660
Did you put more artichoke leaves
down your disposal?

437
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:56,861
No.

438
00:30:57,595 --> 00:30:58,843
What's the problem?

439
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,639
How's that? All right?

440
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,340
Lower, you ape.

441
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,983
- Don't get excited, honey.
- Guess what?

442
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:07,487
- What?
- I got my first period today.

443
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:10,549
That ought to do her.

444
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,920
No thanks necessary.
Just name the little bugger after me.

445
00:31:13,946 --> 00:31:17,445
Yeah, Sluggo Bannister.
Right.

446
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:22,703
I feel like a human swing set here.
Fred, don't touch that.

447
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:27,356
You know I could
dry-wall her into your basement.

448
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,138
I'll keep that in mind, Dale.

449
00:31:35,614 --> 00:31:37,357
We never should have come, Pudge.

450
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:39,718
Fred, stop talking like that.

451
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:44,446
And also, please. Do me a favor.
Don't call me "Pudge" anymore.

452
00:31:44,547 --> 00:31:45,347
Okay.

453
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,894
"Stretch".
Look at you.

454
00:31:50,103 --> 00:31:53,412
You're living the life.
You've got a nice house.

455
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:56,913
You paid a little bit too much,
but it's still very nice.

456
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:59,255
Real estate market
has gone crazy out here.

457
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:01,286
You're important at your office.

458
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,417
And you've got a wonderful wife.

459
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:06,574
Yeah.

460
00:32:09,622 --> 00:32:11,453
To wonderful wives.

461
00:32:13,884 --> 00:32:16,315
Bernice is giving me cancer.

462
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,429
Would you stop talking like that.
Would you listen to yourself?

463
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,730
Do you know what your problem is?

464
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:26,391
You let that woman walk all over you.
You've got to stand up to her.

465
00:32:27,456 --> 00:32:29,138
What the hell happened to
the Fred I knew in high-school?

466
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:31,466
The Fred that could have any girl
in the senior class he wanted to.

467
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,667
When he was a freshman.

468
00:32:34,591 --> 00:32:37,983
A guy who could break up
any class without even trying?

469
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:42,993
I don't know.
Somewhere between graduation...

470
00:32:43,632 --> 00:32:45,511
and the Jerry Lewis telethon.

471
00:32:46,893 --> 00:32:48,328
I just lost it.

472
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,930
Hear that? Bernadette.
Remember her?

473
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:00,731
What was her last name?

474
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:03,009
Moisecracket,
Bernadette Moisecracket,

475
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,110
Her father owned the battery shop
outside of town?

476
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,367
- Beverly.
- No, Bernadette. Don't you remember?

477
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:09,761
- Beverly.
- We did the choreography for her.

478
00:33:09,844 --> 00:33:11,397
You did the...
You built the dance routine.

479
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:13,098
You started it
in gym class.

480
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:16,520
It started like this. The thrusting.
The pelvis thrusting thing.

481
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,221
- No.
- Well come on, show me how it started.

482
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:20,022
You thought it up.

483
00:33:20,023 --> 00:33:22,923
Get your hemorrhoids off the bar stool,
come show me to it started.

484
00:33:23,812 --> 00:33:24,930
Come on, come on, come on.

485
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:30,531
Hey!
Come on.

486
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:36,032
Yeah.

487
00:33:36,574 --> 00:33:38,692
Get it in. Get it tight.
Get it greasy.

488
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:47,858
All right, come on.

489
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:24,359
Hey Baby, say hello to the King.

490
00:34:31,782 --> 00:34:33,483
Ready for takeoff.

491
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,391
A little rusty.
It took me a while to get going.

492
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:05,617
What you have,
you don't lose.

493
00:35:08,157 --> 00:35:09,257
Way to go.

494
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,632
- Jessie!
- What?

495
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:17,833
- He's gone.
- Who's gone?

496
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:20,298
Fred is gone.
He ran away.

497
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,937
I've been abandoned.

498
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:25,951
No wait.
Now Bernice we don't know that for sure.

499
00:35:26,063 --> 00:35:30,212
I went to find the Fred Bannister
I used to be.

500
00:35:30,382 --> 00:35:32,465
Where did he get that crap?

501
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:38,867
Fred!

502
00:35:41,568 --> 00:35:43,268
Fred!

503
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:53,069
- Fred!
- Fred!

504
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,838
- What did you tell him?
- I didn't tell him anything.

505
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:03,539
All I said to him was that maybe he should
try standing up for himself once in a while.

506
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:05,077
You saw what a wreck he was.

507
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:08,348
Yes, Mark, but he was her wreck,
she liked him like that.

508
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:11,226
She craves human sacrifice,
and he was it.

509
00:36:11,992 --> 00:36:13,409
Let's just call the police.

510
00:36:13,575 --> 00:36:15,883
A guy skips out on his wife,
they're going to rush right over.

511
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:17,384
Okay then let's hire a detective.

512
00:36:17,419 --> 00:36:18,632
We can't afford that, Honey.

513
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:21,730
All right, then maybe we can talk
Claudia into watching after Bernice

514
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:22,628
while we work.

515
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:25,484
Are you serious? Your sister would
smother the woman in her sleep.

516
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:32,561
- We should have taken care of it.
- Mark! Oh, Mark!

517
00:36:32,662 --> 00:36:35,962
How the hell am I supposed to pee?

518
00:36:47,723 --> 00:36:49,819
You deal with your evil twin.

519
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,835
Oh for God's sake
Don't make me do this.

520
00:36:57,015 --> 00:37:00,734
Wouldn't you just this once
like to handle something like an adult?

521
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:01,760
No.

522
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:06,460
- Pouting makes wrinkles.
- Oh Jessa, please.

523
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:10,201
I know that by the end of the week
he will be in his knees begging.

524
00:37:19,728 --> 00:37:22,011
That gate was not here yesterday.

525
00:37:22,597 --> 00:37:25,116
Neither was Slaughter Security.

526
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:31,929
Kaddir is Jessie.
Kaddir?

527
00:37:32,942 --> 00:37:34,543
Kaddir, I know you
can hear me,

528
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:39,144
now it took an awful lot for Claudia to come
here today and try and work this thing out.

529
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:41,102
So I think she deserves
a little credit.

530
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:42,103
Credit?

531
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,927
That's the last thing
in the world she needs.

532
00:37:46,949 --> 00:37:48,889
The woman bleeds me dry.

533
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,890
You want to see blood?

534
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:52,761
You just let me in there, you two-bit
desert rat, I'll slash your throat.

535
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,550
You try to come in here
and I'll sell you Bedouin.

536
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:56,451
That's it.

537
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,037
Don't you choke my cherub.
Don't choke my cherub.

538
00:37:59,038 --> 00:38:01,438
- Kaddir, Claudia loves you.
- I do not.

539
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:10,487
Well sir, I think you can see
Hydrolux is a real comer.

540
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:13,446
They're young, but they've already
got the trust of the State Department.

541
00:38:13,452 --> 00:38:17,049
And they've just acquired
a major contract from the Navy.

542
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:20,010
I'd like to make them a cornerstone
of your new portfolio.

543
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,428
Navy, huh?
You know, I was a swabbie once myself.

544
00:38:23,898 --> 00:38:25,323
No.

545
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,107
- Excuse me, Mark?
- Yeah?

546
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:30,508
- Line two's for you.
- I'll call back. Well.

547
00:38:30,534 --> 00:38:32,830
I really think
you ought to take this one.

548
00:38:32,831 --> 00:38:36,231
- She says it's an emergency.
- Oh. Excuse me.

549
00:38:38,247 --> 00:38:39,083
Hello?

550
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:41,261
Bernice, what...?

551
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:45,662
No, I don't know what time
Wheel Of Fortune is on.

552
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:48,518
I left you the TV Guide,
it's right on the dresser.

553
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:53,415
Yes, I realize you're in change, you stupid.
Could you at least try...?

554
00:38:54,494 --> 00:38:55,507
Goodbye.

555
00:38:56,655 --> 00:38:59,246
- Sorry.
- That was an emergency?

556
00:38:59,324 --> 00:39:04,398
Well, yes actually,
in some warped alternate universe.

557
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:20,549
Not so fast, Missy.
It's time to shift my butt.

558
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,650
Mark!

559
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:46,951
Mark!
Jessie!

560
00:39:51,797 --> 00:39:55,845
Move to the right. You're blowing
my fluffy hair all over the place.

561
00:39:57,358 --> 00:39:59,977
Look! A puss, my pussy.

562
00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:03,138
It's so majestic,
Oh, I've got to have it.

563
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:09,039
And an iced tea. With lemon.
In a nice glass.

564
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:11,195
Somewhere.

565
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:17,431
Jiggle the handle.

566
00:40:18,023 --> 00:40:20,736
- How do you handle stress?
- I take a fistful of valium.

567
00:40:21,397 --> 00:40:25,084
I get drunk.
Real drunk.

568
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,998
Polka.

569
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:30,172
Bust somebody.
Anybody.

570
00:40:30,673 --> 00:40:31,932
Pump iron.

571
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:34,337
Meditation.

572
00:40:35,038 --> 00:40:36,042
Sex.

573
00:40:37,112 --> 00:40:38,040
Excuse me, sir...

574
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:40,391
Wait a second, this guy can't
come in here with his camera.

575
00:40:40,513 --> 00:40:43,856
No, we're from Channel 12 News
and we're doing a survey.

576
00:40:43,918 --> 00:40:45,633
How do you handle stress?

577
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:51,001
Well, usually I find the source
of the stress and break his legs.

578
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:54,424
How much does...

579
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:56,741
How much does something like that cost?

580
00:40:56,981 --> 00:41:00,211
I don't know. It all depends on
how much stress is involved I guess.

581
00:41:00,312 --> 00:41:02,012
Usually about $200.

582
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,216
What could you get for say 100?

583
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:06,264
100? I don't know.
A kneecap or something.

584
00:41:06,265 --> 00:41:08,265
I don't know.
200 is usually the rate though.

585
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,239
Okay but what if that was your budget,
what could you get?

586
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:13,470
Well look if you're having money problems,
we can work something out.

587
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:15,909
You can maybe do something like this,
you know I'm also a producer

588
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,579
and I work on some
independent films.

589
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,080
No, I couldn't do anything like that.

590
00:41:20,201 --> 00:41:21,554
- No I think you could.
- No really.

591
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:24,355
You're on TV, you got a good look.
This could be a beautiful thing.

592
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:26,032
No, I'm fine thanks,
and just, okay, thanks.

593
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:28,333
Well let me know,
you know where to find me.

594
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:29,659
Cut that last part.

595
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:37,581
Come in.

596
00:41:39,426 --> 00:41:40,525
What is that?

597
00:41:40,695 --> 00:41:41,486
Strategy.

598
00:41:41,487 --> 00:41:44,987
There are plenty of old acquaintances
just dying to sweep me off my feet.

599
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:46,869
Ranked in financial order?

600
00:41:46,996 --> 00:41:48,932
This is no time
to beat around the bush.

601
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:50,948
What is that asterisk?

602
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:52,835
Over 80.

603
00:41:53,402 --> 00:41:56,242
Claudia, don't you think that you could
give Kaddir another chance?

604
00:41:56,315 --> 00:41:57,976
He tried to crush me
with his automatic gate.

605
00:41:57,977 --> 00:42:00,077
I think he made his feelings
quite clear.

606
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:05,747
Oh, no.
No.

607
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,664
- Jonathan.
- Hi, Mom.

608
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:11,065
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, Jess.

609
00:42:11,066 --> 00:42:13,066
Is Kaddir ready to apologize?

610
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:15,721
- No, he threw me out.
- Damn.

611
00:42:16,274 --> 00:42:19,031
Anyway...
Uncle Mark?

612
00:42:19,697 --> 00:42:21,814
I need a place to crash.

613
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:26,328
- Jonathan, this is not a good time.
- Of course you can stay here, darling.

614
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:29,667
Thanks, thanks.
Oh, Uncle Mark...

615
00:42:30,145 --> 00:42:34,503
- Yes, Jonathan?
- I think I just ran over your cat.

616
00:42:41,887 --> 00:42:47,057
Dear God, here lies the body
of Scruffy Bannister.

617
00:42:47,366 --> 00:42:50,057
And this time,
it's for real.

618
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:55,841
In your infinite wisdom, you saw fit
to give him back to me once.

619
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:59,954
But now you've ripped him
from my busom once again.

620
00:43:02,224 --> 00:43:03,599
What are you guys doing?

621
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:06,812
- Cat funeral.
- Wait a minute. Can I have him?

622
00:43:07,046 --> 00:43:09,538
- No.
- What would you do with a dead cat?

623
00:43:09,547 --> 00:43:12,117
I'll keep him in the freezer
until school starts.

624
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,226
You disgusting little ghoul.

625
00:43:14,256 --> 00:43:15,978
Who are you?
It's mother?

626
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:18,279
Now be good to him.

627
00:43:18,775 --> 00:43:24,771
And get me out of this little piece
of hell on earth you call California.

628
00:43:25,327 --> 00:43:26,327
Amen.

629
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:47,265
I'll kill you again,
kitty-litter breath.

630
00:43:48,244 --> 00:43:50,513
Jerome, I understand.

631
00:43:50,635 --> 00:43:54,658
Some other time then.
Right. Bye.

632
00:43:55,245 --> 00:43:58,758
- You pathetic worm.
- Not going so well, huh?

633
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:04,202
Married. Turned gay. Married.
In jail... malpractice. Dead.

634
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:06,603
I'll tell you, marriage material
is getting tough to find.

635
00:44:06,637 --> 00:44:07,513
Claudia.

636
00:44:08,214 --> 00:44:13,514
What would you say to a nice,
handsome, divorced car dealer?

637
00:44:13,756 --> 00:44:15,621
Foreign or domestic?

638
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:20,509
Jessa, I know what you're up to.

639
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,210
You think you can just force me off
on some total stranger,

640
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:24,811
but I'm telling you, if I don't like...

641
00:44:26,149 --> 00:44:27,519
Is that his?

642
00:44:29,597 --> 00:44:30,897
Lead on.

643
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:44,438
- Here she is.
- Growl. Hello.

644
00:44:44,904 --> 00:44:48,722
So, Jess tells me you and your boy
need a place to stay.

645
00:44:53,561 --> 00:44:54,497
That's right.

646
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:56,309
Be my guest.

647
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:06,202
I can't believe it Mark,
they were like two sex magnets,

648
00:45:06,214 --> 00:45:08,509
just straining
not to slam into each other.

649
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,342
Oh yeah?
I know the feeling.

650
00:45:11,695 --> 00:45:13,330
Let's make love, Jess,
we'll start right here,

651
00:45:13,331 --> 00:45:16,031
work across the lawn and then
we wind up in the begonias.

652
00:45:18,326 --> 00:45:20,091
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What about Bernice?

653
00:45:20,126 --> 00:45:22,727
I threw some raw meat in earlier,
she'll be fine for a while.

654
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:32,353
I can't believe you're old enough
to be Jonathan's mom.

655
00:45:32,374 --> 00:45:33,254
I'm not.

656
00:45:44,678 --> 00:45:46,300
Is something burning?

657
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:58,575
Dad, can we get some marshmallows?

658
00:45:58,654 --> 00:45:59,653
Shut up!

659
00:45:59,702 --> 00:46:03,723
I cannot believe it.
Sixteen pair of Italian pumps incinerated.

660
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:06,624
C.K. did you get those fireworks
out of there?

661
00:46:06,825 --> 00:46:07,725
Yeah.

662
00:46:10,303 --> 00:46:13,434
Well...
most of them.

663
00:46:16,395 --> 00:46:19,091
My tools. My tools.

664
00:46:19,094 --> 00:46:20,897
Your tools? My shoes.

665
00:46:20,998 --> 00:46:24,183
Back off, Gold Card,
I just lost my goddamn house.

666
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:26,393
Well I don't understand
what the big fuss is all about.

667
00:46:26,394 --> 00:46:28,094
Even a cretin like you
must have insurance.

668
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:31,359
Insurance? Oh, I got insurance all right.
It ought to kick in in about three months.

669
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:32,733
What do I do with my kids
in the meantime?

670
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,224
Take them to the Bel-Air hotel,
I mean anyone who owns a Lotus...

671
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:39,202
Who says I own it?
It's a perk I get for trying to sell them.

672
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:43,899
So, Bannister.
What are we going to do about this?

673
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,531
Make sure Fangster stays in his box.

674
00:46:55,532 --> 00:46:57,032
Waste of a good belt.

675
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,584
Jonathan, put down that stuff

676
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:03,076
- and get me a scotch.
- and get me a scotch.

677
00:47:03,088 --> 00:47:04,959
Oh, just make yourself
comfortable, son.

678
00:47:06,068 --> 00:47:09,790
Brenda, you won't believe it.
Our house burned down.

679
00:47:09,885 --> 00:47:14,055
- These are all I could find.
- Fine, Jonathan, just...

680
00:47:14,929 --> 00:47:16,402
Mark, we don't have to do this.

681
00:47:16,414 --> 00:47:20,526
Yes, we do darling, if we want to
avoid a lawsuit for arson.

682
00:47:22,795 --> 00:47:23,978
Does this fold out?

683
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,690
Hey, Mr. Bannister.
Guess what didn't burn up.

684
00:47:46,669 --> 00:47:49,722
I'm calling about the room for rent
for $300 a month.

685
00:47:50,278 --> 00:47:53,435
It is? Terrific.
Immediately?

686
00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:57,536
Uh... seven people?

687
00:47:57,757 --> 00:47:59,841
Uh huh, that's great, Phil.
Listen, by the way,

688
00:47:59,842 --> 00:48:02,042
what's happening with
your guest house out back?

689
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:06,159
Uh huh.
How long is she expected to live?

690
00:48:07,237 --> 00:48:08,890
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

691
00:48:11,629 --> 00:48:13,381
You hang up first.

692
00:48:14,108 --> 00:48:17,247
No, you.
Brenda.

693
00:48:17,778 --> 00:48:19,495
I can hear you breathing.

694
00:48:19,517 --> 00:48:22,078
Jonathan, did your grandmother send you
a birthday check?

695
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:23,643
Grandma's dead, mom.

696
00:48:23,744 --> 00:48:26,844
No, Brenda, you hang up first.

697
00:48:26,845 --> 00:48:29,845
No you.
Brenda.

698
00:48:29,893 --> 00:48:32,245
Hey, did they get another cat?

699
00:48:32,632 --> 00:48:33,937
No, it's the same one.

700
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:37,424
They buried him alive.
Cool.

701
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:39,442
Don't you be getting any ideas.

702
00:48:39,676 --> 00:48:44,499
- But if they can bury him, I can too.
- Well, you get permission first.

703
00:48:45,399 --> 00:48:46,517
- No.
- No.

704
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:49,721
Don't worry about me having dinner.

705
00:48:49,733 --> 00:48:54,570
I'll just lick the crumbs
off my filthy sheets.

706
00:49:35,815 --> 00:49:37,558
- Jessie!
- What is it?

707
00:49:37,659 --> 00:49:40,059
- Don't look in there.
- What do they want?

708
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:45,029
- They want... to stay here.
- Why, Mark, why?

709
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:48,539
I don't know. Maybe we're in
some vacation guide for the damned.

710
00:49:53,834 --> 00:49:56,496
Oh God! Oh God!

711
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,349
- Oh, Mark!
- Jessie!

712
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:06,250
- Go to a hotel!
- Jessie, get out of here!

713
00:50:07,616 --> 00:50:09,454
I don't trust you people!

714
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:13,072
Get out of my house!

715
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:16,774
Jess, run.

716
00:50:17,175 --> 00:50:18,175
Leave her...

717
00:50:20,376 --> 00:50:21,676
Leave her alone.

718
00:50:21,995 --> 00:50:23,578
Jess, leave Jess...

719
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:34,731
Take Bernice.

720
00:50:43,472 --> 00:50:47,559
Mark.
Honey, I know you're frustrated.

721
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:52,117
Oh God, honey,
I'm not in the mood.

722
00:50:52,118 --> 00:50:53,718
- Just...
- What?

723
00:50:53,783 --> 00:50:57,691
Jessie?
I'm way over here. What?

724
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:16,638
Have you guys seen Fangster?

725
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:04,640
- Mark?
- What?

726
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:08,541
We have to do something
about these people.

727
00:52:13,289 --> 00:52:14,877
Yes.
Uh huh.

728
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:19,978
Well, I have only one question: do they all
have to pass out flowers at the airport?

729
00:52:20,779 --> 00:52:23,079
Uh huh.
And shave their heads.

730
00:52:24,377 --> 00:52:25,395
Thank you.

731
00:52:30,361 --> 00:52:32,681
- Hi.
- Jonathan, what are you doing here?

732
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:36,905
Look, Uncle Mark,
I've been watching you.

733
00:52:37,118 --> 00:52:39,141
Having to take care of all of us.

734
00:52:39,293 --> 00:52:42,189
And, so, I'm job hunting.

735
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:47,277
And I though, you know, maybe...
Well I was wondering if...

736
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:55,056
You mean something here?
I do not think so, Jonathan.

737
00:52:55,278 --> 00:52:59,578
Well that's cool. I just...
wanted to get my own place.

738
00:53:00,327 --> 00:53:01,970
I'll call personell.

739
00:53:02,035 --> 00:53:05,610
Well, no special treatment or anything.
I mean, I'll start anywhere.

740
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:08,032
The mail room would be great.

741
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:11,523
In here. Frank.
This is my nephew Jonathan.

742
00:53:11,758 --> 00:53:13,639
Now listen, I want you
to take good care of him, okay?

743
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,324
Welcome aboard, Jonathan.

744
00:53:15,402 --> 00:53:19,225
Hey, wow. Great stamps.
I got a collection.

745
00:53:19,303 --> 00:53:22,163
Good. So listen, if you need anything,
you call me, all right?

746
00:53:22,238 --> 00:53:25,825
You know, my mom was wrong.
You're not an asshole.

747
00:53:26,431 --> 00:53:28,986
I'll be out of your hair
in no time, Uncle Mark.

748
00:53:30,978 --> 00:53:35,375
Hi. Bernice, hi.
Yes, how are you? Good.

749
00:53:35,386 --> 00:53:38,115
Yeah, I want the Wings Of The Night
it's beautiful.

750
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,763
Oh my God, yeah,
I have nails that go just with it.

751
00:53:40,764 --> 00:53:44,364
Oh, I lost mine. Listen...
Yeah, send it COD.

752
00:53:44,507 --> 00:53:48,112
Oh yeah. Two-two for me.
Okay. Bye, bye, hon.

753
00:53:48,986 --> 00:53:51,286
Jessa, what pumps do I wear with this?

754
00:53:51,894 --> 00:53:54,414
No, that's pee for Dr. Penix' test.

755
00:53:54,581 --> 00:53:56,938
He's got to check
the ovum count or something.

756
00:53:56,973 --> 00:53:59,939
You want me to mail
urine to New Jersey?

757
00:53:59,983 --> 00:54:01,296
Yeah, would you?

758
00:54:03,249 --> 00:54:04,171
Wait, wait...

759
00:54:04,205 --> 00:54:05,826
I need your opinion
on something here.

760
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:08,027
These are my favorite names
for the baby so far.

761
00:54:08,218 --> 00:54:13,332
Amaretta, Anziv, Caramel or Treblinka.

762
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,694
You yokel. Naming a baby
after a German concentration camp?

763
00:54:16,972 --> 00:54:19,672
I thought of Treblinka was one
of those cute little fairies in Cinderella.

764
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:20,495
You moron.

765
00:54:20,496 --> 00:54:24,096
Well, I hope my water breaks
all over your fur coat.

766
00:54:46,402 --> 00:54:47,376
Are you okay?

767
00:54:49,672 --> 00:54:54,060
- Remember when that used to be our room?
- Yes, I know. In the days before time.

768
00:54:55,261 --> 00:54:56,161
Baby.

769
00:54:56,934 --> 00:54:58,087
I hate those people.

770
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:01,496
Jonathan got a job.
It's going to get better. I promise.

771
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:17,037
Right now, just you and me,
all alone, right here, in the closet.

772
00:55:21,716 --> 00:55:22,516
There.

773
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:26,025
I don't think he'll be
coming back this time.

774
00:55:27,621 --> 00:55:30,265
Let me ask you a question.
What does the C.K. stand for anyway?

775
00:55:30,474 --> 00:55:31,952
Confirmed Kills.

776
00:55:32,387 --> 00:55:35,657
But I might change it to cat killer.
What do you think?

777
00:55:36,261 --> 00:55:38,427
I think we have a little problem here.

778
00:55:38,741 --> 00:55:39,680
C.K...

779
00:55:40,581 --> 00:55:42,581
do you know what happens when
you cram too many laboratory rats

780
00:55:42,582 --> 00:55:44,081
together in the same cage?

781
00:55:44,432 --> 00:55:47,213
- Yeah, they turn into fags.
- Right, some of them do.

782
00:55:47,242 --> 00:55:50,138
Others just turn into cannibals,
they tear each other apart.

783
00:55:50,203 --> 00:55:52,342
Now when you minimize that space
by blowing rooms apart,

784
00:55:52,343 --> 00:55:54,343
it really aggravates
the situation.

785
00:55:54,742 --> 00:55:57,521
It's just so boring here.

786
00:55:57,556 --> 00:56:00,148
Now you listen to me,
you psychotic little shit.

787
00:56:00,249 --> 00:56:03,649
You either get your act together, or
you're going to be a face on a milk carton.

788
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:06,860
- You got it?
- You touch me, I sue you.

789
00:56:06,888 --> 00:56:08,897
I got a lawyer on retainer.

790
00:56:16,567 --> 00:56:17,567
Hi, hi.

791
00:56:17,864 --> 00:56:18,790
Hi honey.

792
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:22,291
Do you hear that noise outside?
That is C.K. mowing the lawn.

793
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:26,012
All that kid needed was a little discipline,
a little positive motivation.

794
00:56:26,978 --> 00:56:28,766
We can take control
of this situation, darling.

795
00:56:28,778 --> 00:56:30,938
We can be the captains
of our own destiny.

796
00:56:31,352 --> 00:56:35,251
Yes, things are looking up. I think
that this is going to work out just fine.

797
00:56:35,263 --> 00:56:36,218
Don't you, hon?

798
00:56:40,518 --> 00:56:42,019
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

799
00:56:46,137 --> 00:56:48,837
- Shoot them.
- Strangle them.

800
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,238
Cook them in the oven.

801
00:56:50,254 --> 00:56:52,247
- Hide his medication.
- What?

802
00:56:52,348 --> 00:56:54,048
Kindness.

803
00:56:56,099 --> 00:56:58,886
We're talking about someone with
a clean bill of health, right?

804
00:56:58,887 --> 00:57:00,687
The I guess I'd use insulin.

805
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:03,313
Inject 30 CCs into,
say, a freckle.

806
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:06,413
Bingo, all the symptoms
of a massive coronary.

807
00:57:06,418 --> 00:57:09,105
A hammer.
Definitely a hammer.

808
00:57:09,127 --> 00:57:11,962
Oh, I don't know.
Clorox in the bean dip?

809
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:20,268
Jessie, we're back.

810
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:24,099
How would you murder someone?

811
00:57:24,794 --> 00:57:26,960
If you have a question,
Los Angeles...

812
00:57:29,168 --> 00:57:32,101
Ask somebody else. I mean,
I swear to God,

813
00:57:32,113 --> 00:57:35,187
I don't know, I don't know the answers,
I don't know anything anymore.

814
00:57:35,665 --> 00:57:39,061
Well, that's quite an
interesting question, Jessica.

815
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,475
I'm sure that's crossed
everybody's mind now and then.

816
00:57:42,494 --> 00:57:44,606
How would you
murder someone, Karen?

817
00:57:44,715 --> 00:57:48,276
If you were absolutely desperate
to get rid of them, because they were

818
00:57:48,284 --> 00:57:51,920
- driving you out of your fucking mind.
- Whoa.

819
00:57:52,894 --> 00:57:54,955
Well, I'd probably...

820
00:57:56,095 --> 00:57:58,482
It looks like insulin's the way to go

821
00:57:58,497 --> 00:58:00,996
- from what that doctor said.
- Oh, yeah, right.

822
00:58:00,997 --> 00:58:04,897
Oh, like you can just tap-dance your way
into a drugstore and get that stuff?

823
00:58:05,135 --> 00:58:09,140
Please. Oh and that Clorox bit,
oh man, there is a real winner.

824
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:11,967
Those people were up
all night with the runts.

825
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:15,568
And they refused to jiggle the handle.

826
00:58:15,889 --> 00:58:17,411
What are you talking about?

827
00:58:17,889 --> 00:58:19,355
House guests.

828
00:58:20,637 --> 00:58:24,842
I am talking about
house guests from hell.

829
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:29,934
Listen to me, ladies and gentlemen,
no, get that snack later,

830
00:58:29,935 --> 00:58:32,235
you listen to me,
lock your doors.

831
00:58:32,473 --> 00:58:33,800
Don't answer the phone.

832
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:36,300
If you have to leave the country,
then leave the country,

833
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:38,701
but don't let them in.

834
00:58:39,414 --> 00:58:42,550
Don't let them fool you,
they're very, very tricky.

835
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:45,051
They might look like your mother or
your father or your best friend,

836
00:58:45,152 --> 00:58:46,452
but they're not.

837
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:49,937
They're animals.
They're cockroaches.

838
00:58:50,415 --> 00:58:52,816
If we have a nuclear war,

839
00:58:52,817 --> 00:58:58,117
the only living thing
to survive will be house guests.

840
00:59:05,539 --> 00:59:08,575
We'll be right back.
With weather.

841
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,334
Mark?

842
00:59:32,964 --> 00:59:33,964
Hello?

843
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:43,505
Hey buddy! Excuse me!
Seen Mark?

844
00:59:44,731 --> 00:59:46,084
Have you seen Mark?

845
00:59:46,806 --> 00:59:48,641
Upstairs, I think.

846
00:59:50,463 --> 00:59:54,499
Are the Bannisters doing
a little remodeling here?

847
00:59:55,129 --> 00:59:57,325
I guess you might say that, yes.

848
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:00,630
I'm building a bleacher
for the TV set.

849
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:05,600
Sure you are. Okay.
Sure.

850
01:00:12,361 --> 01:00:15,427
- Thank God.
- Move, dork.

851
01:00:18,971 --> 01:00:22,068
You compulsive little midget.
Next time, flush.

852
01:00:22,642 --> 01:00:25,473
Excuse me, have you
seen Mark Bannister?

853
01:00:25,612 --> 01:00:27,646
Well, he was in the kitchen.

854
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:33,778
Mark, my chains are squeaking.
It's time for my lube job.

855
01:00:34,226 --> 01:00:36,700
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

856
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,101
Sure.

857
01:00:41,718 --> 01:00:45,892
Come on, Scruffy,
let's go visit Mr. Microwave.

858
01:00:47,149 --> 01:00:49,480
I'm going to make you
a cat soufflé.

859
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:50,481
Come on.

860
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:56,198
Excuse me, son?
Have you seen Mark Bannister?

861
01:00:56,251 --> 01:01:00,391
Backyard. Shit, look at what
you made me do.

862
01:01:00,792 --> 01:01:03,192
Sorry. Sorry.

863
01:01:12,266 --> 01:01:13,166
Jessie?

864
01:01:17,114 --> 01:01:19,836
God, Wes,
you're not moving in too are you?

865
01:01:19,902 --> 01:01:21,311
What?
No.

866
01:01:21,612 --> 01:01:23,012
Mark didn't come in
to work though,

867
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,513
and your phone's been
off the hook all morning,

868
01:01:25,514 --> 01:01:26,813
and I just thought I'd...

869
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,320
Mark, what the hell's going on here?

870
01:01:29,329 --> 01:01:31,778
Hello Wes.
I didn't sleep too good last night.

871
01:01:31,779 --> 01:01:32,679
At four o'clock in the morning

872
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,880
I think the sprinklers went off
and woke me up.

873
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:37,665
I believe I've got a short in one
of these extension cords too.

874
01:01:37,687 --> 01:01:40,671
No, no, no, no. I mean this.
I mean them.

875
01:01:40,772 --> 01:01:42,072
Why don't you get rid of them?

876
01:01:42,773 --> 01:01:45,573
- Oh no.
- Well if you don't, I will.

877
01:01:45,592 --> 01:01:48,905
- No! We've tried that.
- It just makes more.

878
01:01:48,928 --> 01:01:52,341
We just hand over our paychecks,
stay out of their way.

879
01:01:53,637 --> 01:01:55,267
It's for the best.

880
01:01:55,303 --> 01:01:58,056
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
You've got to listen to me, pal.

881
01:01:58,057 --> 01:02:01,157
If you don't get to work soon,
you're not going to have a paycheck.

882
01:02:01,165 --> 01:02:04,273
Hey, come on, big guy.
Come back to me. Okay? Mark.

883
01:02:04,308 --> 01:02:08,083
Hydrolux down 32 points.

884
01:02:08,217 --> 01:02:11,374
Grindle has gone completely apeshit.
We got to go.

885
01:02:11,409 --> 01:02:12,854
- What should I do?
- We got to go to work.

886
01:02:12,855 --> 01:02:13,755
- To work?
- Chop, chop.

887
01:02:13,756 --> 01:02:14,556
- We should go to work.
- Go to work.

888
01:02:14,563 --> 01:02:15,500
I got to go to work, Jessie.

889
01:02:15,502 --> 01:02:16,836
- OK, hon.
- Bye, Jessie.

890
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:19,337
Bye.
Don't be late for dinner, honey.

891
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:24,750
- OK I won't. What are we having?
- Just squab again.

892
01:02:26,863 --> 01:02:30,229
- What happened here?
- Well, you know...

893
01:02:31,847 --> 01:02:35,403
Crackpot's file indictments
for lawsuits every day, sir.

894
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:39,796
Well, even the Navy can make a mistake.
No, I didn't know that.

895
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:43,678
I guess I missed the
Wall Street Journal all last week.

896
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:45,651
No, don't worry. I'm sorry.
Yes sir.

897
01:02:45,652 --> 01:02:48,245
Your Hydrolux stock
will be sold immediately. Yes, sir.

898
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,936
- Bannister?
- Yes.

899
01:02:50,937 --> 01:02:52,337
I hope you have
a good explanation.

900
01:02:52,341 --> 01:02:54,598
The Grindle situation
is under control.

901
01:02:54,676 --> 01:02:56,563
- That is not what I'm talking about.
- What?

902
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,464
This.

903
01:02:57,554 --> 01:03:01,430
Almost $6000 worth of calls to
South America. From your office.

904
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:05,182
What? Obviously it's a mistake.
I've never made any of these.

905
01:03:05,203 --> 01:03:08,063
- Oh. Who did?
- How the hell do I...?

906
01:03:08,943 --> 01:03:11,974
- I will find out.
- You do that.

907
01:03:16,518 --> 01:03:18,505
Jonathan, do you know anything
about phone...

908
01:03:19,131 --> 01:03:21,229
Hey, Mr. Bannister,
you got another one of these packages.

909
01:03:21,241 --> 01:03:22,041
What packages?

910
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:24,713
Well, these.
Well didn't you get them?

911
01:03:24,825 --> 01:03:27,498
Jonathan said you'd take care of it.
I got to go. See you.

912
01:03:59,398 --> 01:04:01,534
Bannister.
What the hell are you doing?

913
01:04:02,535 --> 01:04:03,435
Sorry.

914
01:04:19,697 --> 01:04:21,006
- Mark.
- Come on.

915
01:04:21,007 --> 01:04:23,607
- Can't you see that I'm not in?
- But, but, but...

916
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:39,652
Tiny, no!

917
01:04:40,405 --> 01:04:41,213
Fred?

918
01:04:41,814 --> 01:04:43,714
It's all right. Steady.
Steady, all right.

919
01:04:43,715 --> 01:04:44,615
What the hell is going on?

920
01:04:44,705 --> 01:04:48,048
I did it Pudge. Stretch.
I did it like you said.

921
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,033
Listen, Fred,
I'll be right back.

922
01:04:49,045 --> 01:04:52,841
Mark!
Meet Tiny Bannister.

923
01:04:54,863 --> 01:04:58,277
- Fred, this is not a good time.
- Mark. I've followed my heart.

924
01:04:58,298 --> 01:05:01,186
- I found the real me.
- What? You joined the circus?

925
01:05:01,251 --> 01:05:04,151
No, I traveled.
I met interesting people.

926
01:05:04,252 --> 01:05:05,352
Well strangers, mostly.

927
01:05:05,353 --> 01:05:08,153
Wait. Let me get rid of this box
and then we'll have...

928
01:05:09,934 --> 01:05:11,061
Oh God.

929
01:05:18,622 --> 01:05:22,315
- Howdy.
- Are you the owner of this animal, sir?

930
01:05:22,346 --> 01:05:24,314
What?
Oh, no.

931
01:05:24,437 --> 01:05:26,858
- She's mine, officers.
- Do you have a permit?

932
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:29,063
No, not yet.
We just got into town.

933
01:05:29,228 --> 01:05:31,764
- Is this your residence?
- No.

934
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:36,038
But my wife's upstairs,
they got her strung up in there.

935
01:05:36,067 --> 01:05:37,059
What?

936
01:05:37,571 --> 01:05:40,734
She's all right and everything.
She just tried to stab me.

937
01:05:40,735 --> 01:05:41,435
No.

938
01:05:43,156 --> 01:05:44,331
Excuse me.

939
01:05:48,696 --> 01:05:52,432
- Jonathan? Jonathan?
- Hey, Mark, did you see the elephant?

940
01:05:52,436 --> 01:05:56,328
- He's got diarrhea.
- You are diarrhea.

941
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:58,998
No, Tiny, not the flower bed.

942
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:01,011
How do we radio this in?

943
01:06:26,267 --> 01:06:28,510
I'll tell you how we radio it in.

944
01:06:30,302 --> 01:06:31,841
Rock house.

945
01:06:34,286 --> 01:06:37,682
- Hey, Mark.
- What is this?

946
01:06:38,177 --> 01:06:42,226
It's got your name on it.
Guess it's your cocaine, man.

947
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:47,292
Baker 63, possible rock house.
Repeat, rock house.

948
01:06:47,293 --> 01:06:50,293
Elephant on premises,
send backup.

949
01:07:17,095 --> 01:07:19,795
Hey, Mark,
What's 1051 in Roman?

950
01:07:20,596 --> 01:07:22,496
Get off the bed.
What are you doing?

951
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:28,772
This is the police.
Come out with your hands up.

952
01:07:28,873 --> 01:07:30,473
We have you surrounded.

953
01:07:42,526 --> 01:07:46,605
Bastards want to play hardball, huh?
Call in the battering ram.

954
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,014
To hell with this.
Get...

955
01:08:12,152 --> 01:08:14,948
Hey, Claude,
what the hell's going on out there?

956
01:08:14,968 --> 01:08:17,780
- Men. Lots of men.
- What the men?

957
01:08:18,092 --> 01:08:20,131
The police.
They're arresting your husband.

958
01:08:21,405 --> 01:08:25,654
That's a good girl, Tiny. Now steady.
Now we're going to head back to the garage.

959
01:08:26,163 --> 01:08:29,623
All right now.
Real slow to the squad car.

960
01:08:30,345 --> 01:08:32,002
Get your hands up.

961
01:08:37,629 --> 01:08:41,138
Hey! Hey you! Buddy!
What the hell are you going out there?

962
01:08:41,187 --> 01:08:43,765
Get off my new driveway.
I just put that in.

963
01:08:43,809 --> 01:08:48,135
Those pebbles are worth $600.
$600!

964
01:08:49,153 --> 01:08:52,788
$600.000.
You old fart.

965
01:09:15,843 --> 01:09:18,265
- Russell, please.
- I can't.

966
01:09:18,277 --> 01:09:20,983
Please let me go on.
I swear to God, I'm better now,

967
01:09:21,005 --> 01:09:25,322
and I will never ever let my home life
affect my professional life again. Ever.

968
01:09:25,462 --> 01:09:26,462
Please?

969
01:09:28,271 --> 01:09:31,741
This is my ass, Jessie.
Get in.

970
01:09:31,742 --> 01:09:32,542
Thank you.
Thank you.

971
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,843
Ten seconds.

972
01:09:37,944 --> 01:09:40,244
This is the channel 12
eight o'clock report.

973
01:09:40,245 --> 01:09:42,045
- With your...
- Camera one, tape in five,

974
01:09:42,046 --> 01:09:47,246
- four, three, two.
- ... question girl, Jessica Bannister.

975
01:09:47,382 --> 01:09:49,795
Good evening.
Our top story tonight:

976
01:09:49,807 --> 01:09:53,162
A SWAT team strike has been called in
on a Santa Monica home.

977
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:57,188
We now go live to
field reporter Brad Bovie. Brad?

978
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,637
That's right, Karen.
Details are still a little sketchy,

979
01:09:59,638 --> 01:10:02,838
but apparently police suspecting
cocaine on the premises

980
01:10:02,839 --> 01:10:04,439
have called in a full strike.

981
01:10:04,589 --> 01:10:09,273
What we've heard is that they have
reason to believe that this is a rock house.

982
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,274
Holy shit!

983
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,317
Wait a minute,
someone's coming out.

984
01:10:22,765 --> 01:10:26,458
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. That was cool.

985
01:10:26,566 --> 01:10:29,515
Are we on TV?
Brenda, call me.

986
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:31,737
- Sir, are you the homeowner?
- No.

987
01:10:32,346 --> 01:10:35,502
- Did you say he was dealing drugs?
- Well we don't...

988
01:10:35,503 --> 01:10:37,603
I never did trust that guy.

989
01:10:37,668 --> 01:10:39,776
It's them quiet,
wimpy types

990
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:42,277
who always get involved
in this sort of thing, ain't it?

991
01:10:42,382 --> 01:10:44,695
Flipping out, raping, killing...

992
01:10:44,739 --> 01:10:47,343
Karen, back to you until we can
make some kind of sense out of this.

993
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:50,504
Tiny please, come on,
this is not your mama.

994
01:10:53,026 --> 01:10:56,476
Thanks, Brad.
We understand that the homeowners

995
01:10:56,477 --> 01:10:58,377
are being sought
for questioning.

996
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:03,232
And that that baby elephant that you
just saw, is apparently unlicensed,

997
01:11:03,254 --> 01:11:05,686
and will be taken
into police custody.

998
01:11:05,687 --> 01:11:10,287
We'll keep you updated
as this bizarre story unfolds.

999
01:11:17,608 --> 01:11:19,786
More poisonous gases.

1000
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,719
Investigators at this hour
are still trying to determine

1001
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:27,420
the source of poisonous gases
which rendered twelve employees

1002
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:30,997
of the Midwilshire District
businesses unconscious.

1003
01:11:55,466 --> 01:11:56,483
Jessie.

1004
01:11:57,375 --> 01:12:00,255
- Thank God, I found you.
- Mark, what happened?

1005
01:12:00,257 --> 01:12:04,020
Our nephew is a drug czar and
now I'm David Jansen.

1006
01:12:04,176 --> 01:12:06,620
- I have this whole...
- The Dow Jones plummeted again today.

1007
01:12:06,621 --> 01:12:09,921
Among the hardest hit
was the Hydrolux Corporation,

1008
01:12:09,998 --> 01:12:13,395
which amid allegations of fraud
by the US Navy,

1009
01:12:13,396 --> 01:12:16,196
fell a record 85 points.

1010
01:12:16,316 --> 01:12:19,778
Hydrolux president,
Robert Nellins was unavailable for comment,

1011
01:12:19,813 --> 01:12:24,214
Channel 12 News has learned however
he's on vacation in Bora-Bora.

1012
01:12:24,374 --> 01:12:28,536
Great. I'm an unemployed David Jansen,
I forgot to sell Grindle's stock.

1013
01:12:28,614 --> 01:12:32,406
- Shit, shit, shit. Come on.
- No. I don't want to go.

1014
01:12:32,449 --> 01:12:34,524
No, I'm staying here. You're not
going to get me out of here, Mark.

1015
01:12:34,525 --> 01:12:36,425
- Honey.
- Let's live here.

1016
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:37,594
What?

1017
01:12:37,695 --> 01:12:40,695
Look, it's beautiful, everything's clean
and nice and...

1018
01:12:40,872 --> 01:12:45,530
Oh, Mark, there's food in the...
Oh, look, Mark, mock-chicken pot pie.

1019
01:12:45,669 --> 01:12:47,591
- Come on Jessie, let's go.
- No. No.

1020
01:12:47,592 --> 01:12:49,792
You're not going to take me away.
I'm not letting go of the...

1021
01:12:49,993 --> 01:12:52,493
Jessie!
Jessie. Jessie.

1022
01:12:53,061 --> 01:12:56,810
Listen to me, Mark. We can
live in one of the soap opera sets.

1023
01:12:56,987 --> 01:13:00,336
They'll never know we're here, Mark.
We can be the phantoms of Channel 12.

1024
01:13:00,371 --> 01:13:02,371
Listen to me,
everything is going to be...

1025
01:13:02,372 --> 01:13:05,072
Don't you say everything's
going to be all right.

1026
01:13:05,728 --> 01:13:10,089
It's not going to be all right.
Ever! Ever!

1027
01:13:10,124 --> 01:13:14,324
Honey, honey, listen, listen,
all right fine. Listen.

1028
01:13:14,629 --> 01:13:19,856
We'll stay here tonight.
Tomorrow we're leaving town.

1029
01:13:19,935 --> 01:13:20,787
Changing our name.

1030
01:13:20,788 --> 01:13:22,888
- We're going to start all over.
- What about our house?

1031
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:26,187
Forget the house, I don't give a damn
about the house, let them repossess it.

1032
01:13:26,544 --> 01:13:29,914
I don't care about our jobs,
I don't care about any of our stuff.

1033
01:13:30,671 --> 01:13:33,769
The only thing that matters...

1034
01:13:33,971 --> 01:13:38,590
...really matters...
is us.

1035
01:13:40,691 --> 01:13:42,591
Oh, honey.

1036
01:14:13,594 --> 01:14:15,616
Yeah. I know what you mean.

1037
01:14:15,812 --> 01:14:18,729
Oh, come on. Let's just grab what we can
and get out of here, okay?

1038
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:23,979
Yes, this is Dr. Penix,
calling from Trenton.

1039
01:14:24,091 --> 01:14:25,907
Bernice I've been trying
to reach you for weeks,

1040
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:27,479
but this line's always busy.

1041
01:14:27,552 --> 01:14:31,866
I've got your test results here.
I don't know how to tell you this, but...

1042
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:37,884
You're not pregnant.

1043
01:14:38,637 --> 01:14:39,437
What?

1044
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:45,240
Dr. Penix just called and he said
there is absolutely no way in the world

1045
01:14:45,451 --> 01:14:47,029
that you are pregnant.

1046
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:49,610
You must have sent
the wrong pee.

1047
01:14:50,608 --> 01:14:54,491
Look at that, Bernice,
your stomach is flat as a board.

1048
01:14:55,383 --> 01:14:57,087
I got a thin fetus.

1049
01:14:57,601 --> 01:15:01,306
Bernice, get over it
and get out.

1050
01:15:02,036 --> 01:15:06,302
You're just jealous because no sperm
in it's right mind

1051
01:15:06,303 --> 01:15:09,003
would swim
up your shriveled canal.

1052
01:15:12,004 --> 01:15:15,004
Let go of me!
Hey, hey!

1053
01:15:35,258 --> 01:15:38,735
- Stay away from me, crazy lady.
- Say it.

1054
01:15:38,836 --> 01:15:39,836
What?

1055
01:15:39,936 --> 01:15:41,907
I want to hear you say it.

1056
01:15:42,885 --> 01:15:43,825
I guess...

1057
01:15:44,532 --> 01:15:45,864
I'm not pregnant.

1058
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,585
But, you know, I could have sworn...
I felt my breasts swelling, constipation...

1059
01:15:49,986 --> 01:15:52,216
- Say it!
- Somebody help.

1060
01:15:52,539 --> 01:15:54,809
Aren't you going to do something?

1061
01:15:54,839 --> 01:15:56,792
- No.
- No.

1062
01:15:56,827 --> 01:15:58,735
I'm going to count to three, Bernice.

1063
01:15:58,845 --> 01:16:01,531
- One.
- I want a second opinion.

1064
01:16:01,532 --> 01:16:02,732
Two.

1065
01:16:04,649 --> 01:16:07,137
- Say it.
- All right, we're leaving.

1066
01:16:07,219 --> 01:16:09,802
Fred, start packing.

1067
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:21,825
Honey, it's over, it's finally over.

1068
01:16:24,652 --> 01:16:25,539
Not quite.

1069
01:16:31,905 --> 01:16:33,579
Let's clean house.

1070
01:16:33,728 --> 01:16:36,437
Yeah.
Kick ass.

1071
01:16:55,921 --> 01:16:58,757
- Company!
- Company!

1072
01:17:08,106 --> 01:17:10,067
Oh, sis!

1073
01:17:10,776 --> 01:17:14,802
Sister's got a surprise for you!

1074
01:17:14,924 --> 01:17:18,760
Oh, you want to play?
Let's go, Bannister.

1075
01:17:20,447 --> 01:17:21,982
Now let's play Cuisinart.

1076
01:17:28,174 --> 01:17:29,779
Oh, Claudia.

1077
01:17:31,161 --> 01:17:32,448
I'm not decent.

1078
01:17:34,353 --> 01:17:36,318
Tell me something I don't know.

1079
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:38,823
Now Jessie, calm down,
I'll get you a valium.

1080
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:43,472
- You think you're real sharp, don't you?
- People are like going totally mental.

1081
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,489
Let me ask you a question!

1082
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:52,104
- Are you circumcised?
- I'm warning you.

1083
01:17:52,843 --> 01:17:55,073
Stop, they're Charles Jourdan!

1084
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,101
Now, I want you
to get your gold-digging,

1085
01:17:58,102 --> 01:18:02,702
lilly white ass
out of my house.

1086
01:18:03,403 --> 01:18:08,203
- Uh.
- No!

1087
01:18:11,004 --> 01:18:14,204
You psycho. Hey, man.
Don't kill me, don't, don't.

1088
01:18:15,505 --> 01:18:17,205
You wimp!

1089
01:18:18,525 --> 01:18:22,247
It always figured you'd come up
short in a clinch. Come on!

1090
01:18:29,608 --> 01:18:32,775
Stay away!
Stay away from me!

1091
01:18:46,376 --> 01:18:49,776
Jesus, what's this?
Jesus Christ. Jonathan.

1092
01:18:50,155 --> 01:18:52,747
- Now you get the hell out of my house!
- Back off! Back off!

1093
01:18:52,817 --> 01:18:55,460
You try that again and I'll cut you,
I swear.

1094
01:19:01,896 --> 01:19:03,426
- Give me your keys.
- What?

1095
01:19:03,427 --> 01:19:06,127
Give me your car keys now!
Shut up!

1096
01:19:06,549 --> 01:19:08,157
Wouldn't you rather
take the Lotus?

1097
01:19:08,936 --> 01:19:09,736
Yeah.

1098
01:19:11,028 --> 01:19:13,516
Yeah. It's an excellent idea.
Here you go... oh.

1099
01:19:13,517 --> 01:19:15,517
I'm real sorry about that.

1100
01:19:15,581 --> 01:19:17,564
You know what? You know what?
I think if we just rested a minute

1101
01:19:17,565 --> 01:19:19,965
and thought about this,
we might be able to work it out.

1102
01:19:19,981 --> 01:19:20,881
Bullshit!

1103
01:19:20,917 --> 01:19:24,378
Now, you know, Jonathan, we're all family,
we could sit down, have a talk, maybe...

1104
01:19:24,421 --> 01:19:27,430
- That's bullshit! Shut up!
- Let's call the prayer line.

1105
01:19:27,587 --> 01:19:30,868
Uncle Mark.
You are a yuppie dickhead!

1106
01:19:32,187 --> 01:19:35,531
One day, I'm going to
buy and sell people like you.

1107
01:19:35,596 --> 01:19:39,184
- I'm going to make some noise.
- We know you are.

1108
01:19:43,085 --> 01:19:44,485
- Jonathan?
- Move!

1109
01:19:44,919 --> 01:19:46,933
Hey, that's my fireworks!

1110
01:19:46,934 --> 01:19:49,134
Where do you think you're going?
Get away from that car!

1111
01:19:49,163 --> 01:19:50,576
That's a loaner!

1112
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:03,504
Stupid things didn't work.

1113
01:20:08,622 --> 01:20:10,728
They always work.

1114
01:20:12,576 --> 01:20:16,936
- I am the king of this castle!
- And I am his queen!

1115
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:22,903
And we will burn it to the ground
before we let any of you back in!

1116
01:20:23,868 --> 01:20:26,665
You... parasites!

1117
01:20:41,702 --> 01:20:43,154
Are you the home owners here?

1118
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:45,054
That's right,
what are you going to do about it?

1119
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:46,564
Well, on behalf of the P.D.,

1120
01:20:46,565 --> 01:20:50,065
I've been authorized to issue an official
apology for what happened last night,

1121
01:20:50,066 --> 01:20:52,166
we're prepared to pay for the damages.

1122
01:20:52,173 --> 01:20:54,790
- All the damages?
- Yes, ma'am.

1123
01:20:54,825 --> 01:20:56,834
What, what about the criminal investigation?

1124
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,678
Well, yeah, there was
some talk about pursuing that.

1125
01:20:59,869 --> 01:21:02,039
Until we found all our
hard evidence was missing.

1126
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,140
What hard evidence?

1127
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:05,042
That cat that dropped dead
on your lawn?

1128
01:21:05,054 --> 01:21:07,095
Yeah, it disappeared
out of the evidence room.

1129
01:21:07,148 --> 01:21:09,457
Believe me, there's going to be
hell to pay over that one.

1130
01:21:29,613 --> 01:21:32,379
Jesus Christ, Bannister!
I've been looking all over for you!

1131
01:21:32,382 --> 01:21:35,515
Oh yeah, Grindle?
Let me tell you something.

1132
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:38,316
I have had it up to here
with loud-mouth bullies like you.

1133
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:39,752
The Navy dropped their fraud charges.

1134
01:21:39,764 --> 01:21:40,966
You want to fire me, go ahead.

1135
01:21:40,968 --> 01:21:42,966
Hydrolux went up 157 points.

1136
01:21:42,978 --> 01:21:43,909
Do you know
what your problem is?

1137
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:45,459
I made a bundle
because you hung in there.

1138
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:47,860
You're the worst kind
of arrogant, small-minded...

1139
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,761
- I want you to work for me.
- Buts!

1140
01:21:49,763 --> 01:21:52,060
- I'll double your salary.
- Screw you.

1141
01:21:52,061 --> 01:21:54,860
- All right, triple.
- Screw you blue.

1142
01:21:54,995 --> 01:21:58,734
Senior Vice-President at four times
your present salary.

1143
01:21:58,735 --> 01:22:00,435
That's my final offer!

1144
01:22:00,612 --> 01:22:02,993
- If that's okay.
- Let me tell you something, asshole.

1145
01:22:02,994 --> 01:22:05,094
Honey.
Shut up.

1146
01:22:07,357 --> 01:22:08,509
We'll let you know.

1147
01:22:08,515 --> 01:22:12,545
Great! Your kind of hard balls
are exactly what I've been looking for.

1148
01:22:12,618 --> 01:22:14,454
You and me are going to make millions!

1149
01:22:17,702 --> 01:22:19,282
I don't believe we've met.

1150
01:22:20,385 --> 01:22:22,081
Bob Grindle, ma'am.

1151
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:27,325
- And you are?
- Your wildest dreams come true, darling.

1152
01:22:29,995 --> 01:22:32,429
Well, Lotus is definitely
the car of the future.

1153
01:22:32,484 --> 01:22:35,431
When my insurance kicks in,
I'm going to be back on easy street.

1154
01:22:35,466 --> 01:22:38,192
But in the meantime I was wondering
if you might happen to have room

1155
01:22:38,193 --> 01:22:41,293
at your place for me
and a couple of wonderful kids.

1156
01:22:41,301 --> 01:22:42,301
Maybe.

1157
01:22:42,588 --> 01:22:44,829
- Dad, I don't want to live with some cop!
- Hey!

1158
01:22:44,963 --> 01:22:47,580
You want to eat brussel sprouts
three meals a day, punk?

1159
01:22:53,838 --> 01:22:55,416
Yo baby, chop-chop.

1160
01:22:55,595 --> 01:22:57,908
Don't "yo baby" me.

1161
01:22:58,417 --> 01:23:01,091
You said you were going to change,
I thought might you change,

1162
01:23:01,092 --> 01:23:03,592
and maybe you'd shave,
you know you look like Fu Manchu.

1163
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,709
- you could...
- Bernice. Remember what we practiced?

1164
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:11,192
- No yupping.
- That's right.

1165
01:23:11,414 --> 01:23:13,863
Fine, good, you can do
all the talking from now on

1166
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:16,464
because my jaws are tired
after all these years...

1167
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:27,773
Scruffy-doodle! Oh, there is a God.
Come to me.

1168
01:23:31,913 --> 01:23:32,861
Bernice,

1169
01:23:33,848 --> 01:23:35,739
I don't think he wants to go with you.

1170
01:23:36,457 --> 01:23:40,175
According to my calculations, he has...
five lives left.

1171
01:23:40,414 --> 01:23:42,597
He's welcome to spend the rest
of them with us if he wants to.

1172
01:23:42,688 --> 01:23:43,888
He's earned it.

1173
01:23:44,241 --> 01:23:46,867
Don't be silly,
come to mama, sweetie.

1174
01:23:49,032 --> 01:23:50,233
Traitor.

1175
01:23:51,655 --> 01:23:53,742
We really got to stay in touch, Stretch.

1176
01:23:56,242 --> 01:23:57,702
I'll call you once a month.

1177
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:00,673
Is collect okay till I get a job?

1178
01:24:01,982 --> 01:24:05,587
All right.
If you ever get to New Jersey...

1179
01:24:05,808 --> 01:24:07,700
We'll stay at the Holiday Inn.

1180
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,700
I cannot believe this place
is really ours again.

1181
01:25:10,157 --> 01:25:11,375
I'll be back.

1182
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,001
.
