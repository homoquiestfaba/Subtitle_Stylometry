4
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,052
With this way, we can share everything

5
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,065
Looks.

6
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:49,098
They're still so in love

7
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:54,870
How great is that?

8
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:01,020
So, what do you see it's going?

9
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:06,415
Well, tonight we're just going back to my place

10

Your mom...

19
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:57,867
She snores like a rhinano
And then music's just started.

20
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:00,275
Hello.

21
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:01,974

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,994
You live with your parents?

26
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:21,091
Is that a problem?

27
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:23,102
Are you kidding me!

28
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:25,538
- I'm just sleeping.
- Stepping down the stair.

29
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:28,531
- Unbelievable!
- The shelter is put.

30
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:31,767
You moved the umbrella upstair?

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,880
We gotta get rid of that thing.

32
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:37,873
You know, it's gonna get to us

33
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:41,444
And she's out

34
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:43,947
Another bites the dust.

35
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,982
And he's still here

36
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:50,853
Failure to launch

37
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:04,133
Welcome on board.

38
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:39,135
Papitas fried.

44
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:20,409
Are you kidding me?

45
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:27,516
Do not you forget your afternoon snack.

00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:30,953
- Thinks fast!
- Good-bye.

47
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:56,820
So you dumped Melissa?

48
00:04:56,856 --> 00:04:59,848
Technically, she dumped me.

49
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:03,085
- What's happened?
- Last night...

50
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:07,376
We're at a restaurant. She saw a couple holding hands

51
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:10,926
And then she decided to hold my hand.

52
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:15,097
SO...she smiled at me

53
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:18,302
Next thing I know is she give me her look!

54
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:23,606
- Dude I'm so sorry.
- Did Not it pass anything.

55
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:26,909
It was its hour to know to my parents.

56
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,321
- ¿The parents? Not.
- Bye-bye Melissa.

57
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:32,314
- Again.
- ¿What do you mean?

58
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:35,690
I mean, my... friend

59
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:38,197
That you fear him al love.

60
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:41,223
Crap. Not, not, not. Him do not I fear al love.

61
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,732
I love al love.

62
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:46,672
Looks, I have had many girlfriends. Well?

63
00:05:46,673 --> 00:05:48,674
And at times I am the nail
That removes another nail.

64
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:51,243
Other times, with luck I am the
that serves to explore other...

65
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:53,804
Areas of its sexuality. Well?

66
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:56,839
But always we entertain. Thanks!

67
00:05:57,784 --> 00:06:00,519
I entertain, they
Also. Is good for the two.

68
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,589
And it would say that is good for
The civilization as an all.

69
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,492
- If but people thought thus...
- They Would Sleep either for the nights.

70
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:10,195
In a double bed with sheets of
Superman that you have since the 6 years.

71
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:13,532
There is who sleeps in a small one
In the basement of its mother.

72
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,334
It is an orthopedist and I need it.

73
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:19,805
Al less do not I live of my parents being able
Follar in all the continents.

74
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:22,041
I am a wandering man.
A plant rodadora.

75
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:24,343
A search engine truly. And
a truth that have found...

76
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:27,713
is that the children are the
Greater happiness of the parents.

77
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:29,848
Therefore not abandonment the house
of my parents, because...

78
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,017
- ¡They would miss Me!
- Amen, brother.

79
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,553
And nevertheless, in North America
They criticize us as we live.

80
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:37,546
We should celebrate
Our way of life.

81
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:40,326
- We Are men that still live at home.
- ¡Yes!

82
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:43,262
We have not to ask excuses
By as we are or who we live.

83
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:45,431
- ¡Not!
- AND in this table, men...

84
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:47,525
I see three winners.

85
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:51,337
And the ones that be there outside and they see
Another thing, that come to discuss.

86
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:55,541
Because alone with a load of dynamite
They will remove me of the house of my parents.

87
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:58,777
- ¡That boy already is 35 years old!
- He Is that he it is not fair...

88
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:00,837
¡35 years!

89
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,420
We were good parents, already
We should have finished.

90
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:08,987
I do not blame al our by being remained, my house
It is better than any that be paid.

91
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:12,091
Our son is he overloads.
He flies so much that is not logical...

92
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:13,992
That have own apartment.

93
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:15,728
- I know It.
- AND has many pilot... friends

94
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,197
That they leave it to be remained in their houses.

95
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:21,700
I would say that all is matter of
Being afraid to give them hams.

96
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:24,603
Itself it cannot be built a
Marries without a... hammer.

97
00:07:24,604 --> 00:07:27,596
¿Someone wants a door knocker of Guava?

98
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,310
I learned to do them in Maui.
They cause forget you the problems.

00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:32,710
It takes, affection.

100

And Bud was done another. They want to see it?

104

00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:05,043
Incredible.

110
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:08,618
¿As many times to the week
They believe that we do it?

111
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:14,787
I cannot believe it. How did they do it?
Douggie is very good but...

112
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:17,780
¿How did they achieve that themselves away?

113
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:21,593
- It Knew a girl.
- ¿A girl?

114
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:25,831
- Tripp brings an each week.
- We Say that has not known...

115
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:28,824
To the adequate one.

116
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:35,278
I do not want another reclinador.
I want somewhat new.

117
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:38,276
This is new.

I do not speak of that. OK.

00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,417

Lover in the next 6 months.

00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,253
And smooth jazz. Is almost narcotic.

00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:52,235
Is a radiologist.

175
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:54,673
- That is better than other.
- It Offered to do me a revision...

176
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:56,594
Of complete body, free.

177
00:11:56,609 --> 00:12:00,269
- That is not cheap.
- I know It, I am very touched.

178
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:06,708
¿How pretty?

179
00:12:07,153 --> 00:12:09,087
Pretty.

180
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:13,525
Tripp is very good type. Is
Intelligent, sweet, nice.

181
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,829
Our encounter was very
Good. I believe that has potential.

182
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,565
- ¿Then ready the launch?
- Basing on the evaluation...

183
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:23,335
of personality, I believe that its
son this house... will leave

184
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:26,328
And will live alone for June 15.

185
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:29,708
¡Hallelujah!

186
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:33,145
They would be surprised of as many as
Adult children still live at home.

187
00:12:33,146 --> 00:12:37,049
My opinion is that the cause
Main is lack of self-esteem.

188
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,852
- Oprah speaks of that always.
- Oprah does not know neither crap.

189
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:44,256
When I was a boy, nobody
Had self-esteem, and we grew well.

190
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:46,958
You are a rock, Al. You do
A better woman of me.

191
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,862
Many youths that would owe
Being capable of being gone, they do not be able.

192
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:53,098
That it is known like
"Failure of launch".

193
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:55,801
And that is my role. The youths
they develop their self-esteem to bias...

194
00:12:55,802 --> 00:12:59,204
of a romantic relation,
So I simulate him a.

195
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:02,507
We have a memorable encounter,
we will know us better...

196
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:05,911
in some coincidental suppers, he me
will help with my emotional... crisis

197
00:13:05,912 --> 00:13:09,014
and then I know to its
friends, if is that has...

198
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:12,851
and then abandonment that something teach me,
but what is important is that...

199
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:15,721
He establishes ties with me.
He is removed of you...

200
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:18,384
And itself mute away.

201
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:21,621
¿How you are sure
That will fall in love with you?

202
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:24,329
I will see me pretty, me entire
of what he likes...

203
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,431
And I pretend that i like also.

204
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:29,424
Thus is like functions.

205
00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:32,437
- ¿AND the sex?
- Al, never I have sex...

206
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:36,842
With the clients. Besides, I have
that to maintain to Tripp motivated...

207
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:41,163
and admit it, after it
men have sex with a...

208
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,540
- ¿We should do something?
- Good, do him the life but difficult.

209
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:50,145
Already they know, but tasks, but
Responsibilities, those things.

210
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:53,892
I believe that you should know that Tripp
Has had difficult separations.

211
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,961
I promise them that when this finish...

212
00:13:55,962 --> 00:14:00,228
Tripp will be an adult
Independent and autosuficinte.

213
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:03,762
¡Do not help it!

214
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,937
- Is going to run.
- ¡Do Not do it, do not do it!

215
00:14:05,938 --> 00:14:08,707
- I have You, I have... you
- Care. I will run.

216
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,699
¡You will not do it, will not do it!

217
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:12,210
- ¡Crap!
- Is a bad word, Jeffrey.

218
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:14,412
Is also the bastard, but
Alone it signifies not married parents.

219
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:15,613
You look at, look at...

220
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:18,607
Is going to arrive... ¡Al final!

221
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:23,083
- ¡In its face!
- ¡You Sit down!

222
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:25,423
Very well, good attitude before the sport.

223
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:28,621
- Very well.
- Go, me magpie the front.

224
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:31,895
Very pretty... P of loser.

225
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:34,232
You will not be able to continue thus.
You will walk to your house.

226
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:37,569
- Very good uncle.
- Are 6 miles. Will delay two days.

227
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,337
- Hello, small.
- Hello, mom.

228
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:42,874
- Tripp, we go.
- OK. There is but papitas and sauce?

229
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,708
I went not to the store today.

230
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:48,612
But can go you.

231
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:51,583
And you said that need your
Pants of basketball.

232
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:53,351
- I put Them in the washing machine.
- Thanks mom.

233
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:57,055
But it was forgot me to light it.
Will have to do it you.

234
00:14:57,056 --> 00:15:00,091
- ¿To Wash?
- AND... your bath needs cleaning.

235
00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:02,194
I left you the things in the walkway.

236
00:15:02,195 --> 00:15:06,331
And when to put an end to the gloves
Of rubber, you veered them al reverse.

237
00:15:06,332 --> 00:15:09,324
Good-bye.

238
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:15,597
Your mom is sick.

239
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:19,928
This is very pleasant. Never
I was before in a sailboat.

240
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:23,648
It would be amused... if never
I step again land sign.

241
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,649
I would like but if
You left of the spring.

242
00:15:27,353 --> 00:15:31,256
But I do not want to remove you al sea in
The first appointment and that fall.

243
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:33,725
Up to now I am very impressed.

244
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,728
A beautiful place, a simple food.

245
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:39,130
I assume that this technique
Has functioned before.

246
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:41,099
Thus is, lady.

247
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:44,313
- ¿This time Functions?
- ¿You Know what? Well yes.

248
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,340
We are going to walk.

249
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,208
I have not had just had lunch.

250
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:55,237
Yes, you finished.

251
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:59,851
In serious I am not of the
Small that do not eat. I want...

252
00:15:59,852 --> 00:16:02,888
- I wanted all that.
- Technically, the sailboat is not mine.

253
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:05,881
In fact, is not mine at all.

254
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,926
- ¿What?
- I seeing ships.

255
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:12,197
I would love one thus, but not
Is the adequate moment in my life.

256
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:16,278
Besides, the owner of this
Ship is just behind you.

257
00:16:17,003 --> 00:16:20,305
¡Hello, Mr. Axelrod!
I thought that was of trip.

258
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:23,002
Was, but now not.

259
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:25,944
¿What is this? A holder?
¿You eat in my ship?

260
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:28,470
Not.

261
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:31,506
¿When did it redesign the wagon?

262
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,854
- Oh... a buyer.
- Can be. How fast is?

263
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:38,847
- 73.
- The wood is somewhat dark.

264
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,527
- The wife chose it.
- He Has beautiful lines.

265
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:45,395
And is very fast.

266
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:48,423
And yes that is navigation.

267
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:49,999
I will think it.

268
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:52,737
- Thanks by its time.
- Yes, lady.

269
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:55,730
Thanks.

270
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:58,744
¿And you left that was itself?

271
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:01,713
One must give him space, Mr. Axelrod.

272
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:04,444
Now...

273
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:07,475
I go after her.

274
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:12,349
¿Excuse, lady?

275
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:15,694
- ¿Yes that is navigation?
- "A history of Philadelphia".

276
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:18,687
Very well. Well.

277
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:21,333
Assuming that to cause to pass
by owner of a yate...

278
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:24,334
was a brilliant idea
But with defects.

279
00:17:24,804 --> 00:17:27,806
- ¿How do you see the remainder of the day?
- Do Not I know it.

280
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,008
I have so much hunger that cannot think.

281
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:33,411
- The seagulls were eaten my lunch.
- ¿I carry You to a restaurant?

282
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:36,114
- ¿You will cause pass for the owner?
- Not.

283
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:39,475
The restaurants that
They are mine they are in Europe.

284
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:47,583
Hello, Ace.

285
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,761
Is happy me that have come.
I thought that you were at home.

286
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:52,287
I fell in an enormous crack.

287
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:55,233
- I frightened Me.
- ¿You Came out with the lazy girl?

288
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:57,435
Paula. I did it, we have lunch together.

289
00:17:57,436 --> 00:18:00,772
- ¿There Will Be a second quotes?
- There Will Be a second appointment.

290
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:03,108
But the relation is
It condemned al failure.

291
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:06,101
Yes. And why?

292
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:09,243
- You Live with your parents.
- Is right.

293
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:11,950
Our life is
it designed to avoid...

294
00:18:11,951 --> 00:18:13,485
Any relation of couple.

295
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:15,887
We have left a single time. Is a
Good small and I a good boy.

296
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,880
We entertain and I will tell them something.

297
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,884
Nothing... is condemned.

298
00:18:48,654 --> 00:18:50,884
Another accident.

299
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,016
¿What do you do?

300
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:56,051
Recalls, we are visitors here.

301
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:02,731
It takes.

302
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,633
- ¿You give Him peanut?
- Yes.

303
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,138
She eats that all the time.

304
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:10,308
This is what wants. A
Regalito of the city, baby?

305
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:13,278
Is not a boy, Tripp.

306
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:15,080
Looks the peaceful thing that is.

307
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:18,073
A bit of chocolate, baby.

308
00:19:18,184 --> 00:19:22,220
- ¿A bar of protein?
- All they love the chocolate, baby.

309
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:25,123
- It is saying that not.
- You Look at to the eyes.

310
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:28,116
It says not, Tripp.

311
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:35,223
¿Friend?

312
00:19:42,408 --> 00:19:44,409
¿What does? That is a squirrel?

313
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,402
Not, an ardillita listed.

314
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:52,107
Care with the bike.

315
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:03,017
Hello. I am Tripp.

316
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:06,321
You should be Kit.

317
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:10,969
- Is a sinsonte.
- ¿Who did what do?

318
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,200
- ¿The sinsonte?
- ¿What is?

319
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:16,231
¿Do not you listen it? That uncomfortable sound.

320
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:19,206
Already I listen it.

321
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:22,280
I investigated it. They can imitate
you alarm of cars, telephones...

322
00:20:22,281 --> 00:20:25,049
And to other birds. I called to
Control of Plagues and they told me...

323
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,053
that enjoyment to one of the but
Talentosos singers of the nature.

324
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:32,046
- ¿Yes?
- I Am going to kill it.

325
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:34,623
OK, I am ready.

326
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,252
Hello.

327
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:38,957
- They Look at that.
- AND they look at that.

328
00:20:38,998 --> 00:20:41,990
- Pretty shoes.
- ¿Yes? Thanks.

329
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:45,066
OK, good, we go.

330
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:46,833
- ¿You Are ready?
- Yes.

331
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:48,965

- Thanks.
- Good-bye, Kit, luck with the...

333
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:02,253
- A bribe of ardillita.
- Of course.

334
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:04,722
- AND was not an ardillita normal.
- You Are right.

335
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:08,983
Was large, like a wildcat
Gigantic, an ardillita bear.

336
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:12,597
I am lucky to be here.

337
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:15,133
- ¿What says the doctor?
- Do Not I need to consult it.

338
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:17,898
I have a special cream at home.

339
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:20,201
- ¿Cream for ardillitas?
- Yes.

340
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:23,231
- ¡What luck!
- I know It.

341
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:27,145
- ¿You like the Japanese food?
- It fascinates Me.

342
00:21:27,146 --> 00:21:29,380
And also I will ask a dessert
enormous, I will drink too much...

343
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,009
And I will speak of my old bride and groom.

344
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:35,043
- ¿That intimidates you?
- For nothing.

345
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:38,479
- Health, Paula.
- Health.

346
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:44,459
Well. T-r-i. Double
P. To eat squid.

347
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:49,935
- ¿You Need aid?
- I have It, I have it.

348
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:51,527
Looks, sight...

349
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,930
- I Admire your confidence.
- Thanks, I I am very...

350
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:58,666
Ambi... dexterous.

351
00:22:00,012 --> 00:22:02,776
¡Crap! I feel it.

352
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:05,116
Excuse. The squid was greasy.

353
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:08,109
- I feel It.
- Is Not easy.

354
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:11,389
I have not said anything.

355
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:14,392
You speak me of you. Why dedicate you?

356
00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:18,326
I... am a teacher of boys
With special needs.

357
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:26,514
¿How you have the hand? Itself you
It passed the effect of the medicine?

358
00:22:32,044 --> 00:22:35,138
Good... again at home.

359
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:38,109
Again at home.

360
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,351
- I passed It very well.
- I also.

361
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:43,344
- Well.
- I entertained.

362
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:48,683
¡You silence you, crazy bird!

363
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:53,187
- Hello, Kit.
- ¿What? Hello.

364
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:57,091
- ¿They can see me?
- Yes.

365
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:00,504
Barbaric.

366
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:03,731
- ¿What?
- Supper and a spectacle.

367
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:11,080
Good evening.

368
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:12,811
Good evening to you.

369
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,752
¿In what type of ship is seen if same?

370
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:18,022
It do not I know, but yes I know that
I should leave to open sea.

371
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,124
Should ask some questions.

372
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,990
¿He likes the velocity?

373
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,162
¿He likes to listen the sound of the motor?

374
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:27,065
¿Wants to go of the point TO
Al point B quickly?

375
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:29,634
If that he likes, needs a
Ship with a powerful motor.

376
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:32,136
OK, OK, that is. Being able. That I am I.

377
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:34,639
Is the best. But perhaps
Want to take it to him slowly.

378
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,441
Listening the wind and the waves.

379
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:39,077
That the dawn and the
Sunset be its guides.

380
00:23:39,078 --> 00:23:42,680
Knowing that al can turn around
World with half a tank of gasoline.

381
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:44,114
Now...

382
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:46,617
if that seems him well...

383
00:23:46,652 --> 00:23:49,954
Perhaps it need a sailboat.
This is not a hobby.

384
00:23:49,955 --> 00:23:52,822
This... is a way of life.

385
00:23:52,858 --> 00:23:55,850
That is passion. What has passed you?

386
00:23:56,495 --> 00:23:58,696
- ¿TO my?
- I want to feel the wind.

387
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:01,132
I do not want to feel... I
I want to cause the wind. OK?

388
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:03,334
- Sight...
- ¿To Be windy? Itself does not be windy...

389
00:24:03,335 --> 00:24:06,404
- It anchored in the spring.
- I want to be the powerful type. Being able.

390
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:10,241
- I want to feel the propela underneath...
- The ones that drink coffee with a lot of cream...

391
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:13,234
Are not powerful types.

392
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:18,750
Expects, wait, slowly, Paula.

393
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:21,743
Was my better friend.

394
00:24:22,621 --> 00:24:25,488
Since was a cachorrito...

395
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:29,127
Alone a pelotita of hairs,
was too small...

396
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:31,892
Be risen to my bed.

397
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,922
And now...

398
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:39,427
¿Has a napkin?

399
00:24:41,673 --> 00:24:43,607
The life saved me. You know?

400
00:24:43,642 --> 00:24:46,634
And now I cannot do anything by him.

401
00:25:09,435 --> 00:25:12,427
Is happy me so much that be here.

402
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:17,198
Of course.

403
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:23,492
¿I can remain to
Alone with him a minute?

404
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:27,341
- Thanks.
- I Will Be outside.

405
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:37,820
Thanks, Gretchen.

406
00:25:37,863 --> 00:25:39,626
When want.

407
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:42,133
The phase of the crisis
Emotional is criticism.

408
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:45,126
I cry, he cries. He unites us totally.

409
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:47,205
¿How much while will sleep?

410
00:25:47,206 --> 00:25:50,086
Half an hour. It came to be fixed a tooth.

411
00:25:50,943 --> 00:25:53,044
- ¿Which is its real name?
- Do Not I know it.

412
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:57,005
I alone them clean the
Teeth and them short the balls.

413
00:26:02,788 --> 00:26:05,389
- That is so sad...
- Was a precious dog.

414
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,226
- She was destroyed.
- This is what needs.

415
00:26:08,227 --> 00:26:09,660
Good option.

416
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:10,855
There is.

417
00:26:10,896 --> 00:26:12,396
- Hello, Paula.
- Hello.

418
00:26:12,397 --> 00:26:14,899
These are my friends
Demo and Ace. She is Paula.

419
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,300
It is a pleasure to know them.

420
00:26:16,301 --> 00:26:18,769
Lament a lot your loss...

421
00:26:18,804 --> 00:26:21,364
- Thanks.
- Pretty. How you are?

422
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:22,964
Hello.

423
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:25,610
The majority of the men
they to have sent flowers...

424
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:27,670
Chocolates, perhaps. But...

425
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:30,448
I should I say that this did not expect it me.

426
00:26:30,449 --> 00:26:33,117
Any it can send you flowers, Paula.

427
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:36,110
Now I am going to count you the major secret.

428
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:39,624
Action of fingers is called.
Fast fingers in the trigger.

429
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,718
Is a double trigger.

430
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,929
But bombs of painting in less
Time signifies victory.

431
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,591
We are going to see.

432
00:26:46,632 --> 00:26:50,334
When leave and the bombs of painting
fly to you to 200 miles per hour...

433
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:55,135
I guarantee you that you will not think about
The deceased and marvelous Mr. Fred.

434
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,232
Go. Really they fly so fast?

435
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,542
¡I am very sorry!

436
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,183
- ¡Good shot!
- Thanks.

437
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:09,176
He is well.

438
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,382
We are going to shoot him the strangers.

439
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:23,134
The first one that give to the
Small earns a beer.

440
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:26,127
That type laughed at my. Who they are?

441
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:30,205
- The Babies of the Devil are called.
- Are Not evils.

442
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:33,010
Will be an excellent test
Of our dexterity.

443
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:36,003
- ¿They are champions?
- We will Not gain.

444
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:56,924
¡I am outside!

445
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:03,698
¡You are mine, rubiecita!

446
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,982
¿I remained was?

447
00:28:31,303 --> 00:28:34,295
Did not it know that they sold beer here.

448
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,732
It do not they sell.

449
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:48,609
¿You can give me a?

450
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,812
Not.

451
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,292
¿It is hot, truth?

452
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:13,601
It was a pleasure to speak with you.

453
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:19,643
¿Paula?

454
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:20,982
¡I feel it!

455
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:24,011
¿Account if is an accident?

456
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,391
I want that come to my.

457
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:30,194
¡Not thanks, I will remain
Here to the end!

458
00:29:30,195 --> 00:29:33,187
¡Now!

459
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,592
I am outside.

460
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:42,706
- ¡I Am outside!
- ¡Did Not you die in vain!

461
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,676
¿Where is, Paula?

462
00:29:45,711 --> 00:29:48,271
The deditos, the deditos...

463
00:29:48,313 --> 00:29:50,281
¿Chime?

464
00:29:50,315 --> 00:29:53,011
You leave, salt, be where be.

465
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:56,531
While but quickly
You lose, but quickly will go.

466
00:29:58,657 --> 00:30:00,284
¡Go!

467
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:03,317
¿And now who laughs?

468
00:30:10,836 --> 00:30:13,828
¿Of where that left?

469
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,040
- ¡Hello, Kit!
- ¿It was amused, truth?

470
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:19,033
¿You know what? I am going to powder me the nose.

471
00:30:19,544 --> 00:30:22,246
Seems that no longer you are sad
By the death of your dog.

472
00:30:22,247 --> 00:30:26,327
If had one and there was itself
They died, this would help a lot.

473
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:29,485
Yes that has control of the space.

474
00:30:29,488 --> 00:30:32,056
- ¡AND a marvelous hair!
- Thanks.

475
00:30:32,057 --> 00:30:35,059
- You have to remain you with this.
- Is marvelous, a lot, Tripp.

476
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,551
¿Already we can go us?

477
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:39,597
Knowing the friends is very
Important. The men need...

478
00:30:39,598 --> 00:30:43,267
knowing that not alone we they like
They, if not also their friends.

479
00:30:43,268 --> 00:30:46,170
Well. The high one is
Pretty. Why it is dedicated?

480
00:30:46,171 --> 00:30:49,774
It designs software. Works in its
Basement, but does a lot of money.

481
00:30:49,775 --> 00:30:54,815
Not, that is the small one. The high one
Has just said good-bye of a store.

482
00:30:56,014 --> 00:30:59,006
- ¿How to choose?
- This goes very well.

483
00:30:59,384 --> 00:31:02,319
I am happy. Then already we can go us.

484
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:07,454
Not until me the sign. If not
It gives it me, the friends do not want me.

485
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:12,153
I believe that they are giving it you.

486
00:31:13,632 --> 00:31:15,327
Oh, yes.

487
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:18,359
Tripp goes passing each
Step perfectly.

488
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,930
I believe that tomorrow it
I will leave that something teach me.

489
00:31:35,086 --> 00:31:38,021
There are two forms to rotate a sailboat.

490
00:31:38,056 --> 00:31:41,184
They veered toward the wind or against him.

491
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:45,896
That is something that itself is not owed
doing with a novice on board...

492
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:48,799
- So I will try it.
- Wait, wait.

493
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,602
- ¿Why is evil?
- Is Not evil, is amused.

494
00:31:51,603 --> 00:31:54,595
We go, ponte there.

495
00:31:59,077 --> 00:32:02,012
¡We go, small!

496
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:08,886
¡By God!

497
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,520
The threat to be beheaded
It does it but interesting.

498
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,052
We do this knot, thus...

499
00:32:20,332 --> 00:32:25,031
OK. Port side and starboard and all that.

500
00:32:25,937 --> 00:32:29,417
Too many words. Alone
I want tostarme al sun.

501
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:31,934
- It Takes the rudder.
- ¿What?

502
00:32:31,977 --> 00:32:34,411
¿Really?

503
00:32:34,446 --> 00:32:36,607
Him it is called to be al command.

504
00:32:36,648 --> 00:32:38,282
¡Wait, wait! What will you do you?

505
00:32:38,283 --> 00:32:40,751
- I Will Descend to cover.
- ¿What do there is in cover?

506
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:43,053
Beer, wine, papitas, ron. I do not know.

507
00:32:43,054 --> 00:32:46,714
- Is Not my ship.
- Do Not I know what I do. In serious.

508
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:49,952
- You are sailing.
- ¿AND if I collide with something?

509
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:58,559
I believe that you will be well.

510
00:33:01,406 --> 00:33:04,398
I am sailing.

511
00:33:18,823 --> 00:33:21,815
¡Is precious!

512
00:33:31,536 --> 00:33:33,337
I thought that to leave in
sailboat was good idea...

513
00:33:33,338 --> 00:33:36,671
But... ¡my God! Is marvelous!

514
00:33:37,943 --> 00:33:41,663
You should buy it. Me
I imagine that is expensive. And what?

515
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:46,073
I like, but not...

516
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,749
I do not want one new.

517
00:33:49,788 --> 00:33:52,957
What I would love...
Is one old of wood.

518
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:56,961
Is but difficult the maintenance.
But when you have one...

519
00:33:56,962 --> 00:33:59,931
Is like to be part of something.

520
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:03,433
As if were connected.

521
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:06,437
To the original people that
they sailed to the unknown thing...

522
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:10,218
and things said as:
"¡Mierda, what a large wave!"

523
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:14,107
Do it. You buy it to you.

524
00:34:14,145 --> 00:34:17,314
¿To whom imports him
While can sail?

525
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:19,180
I am working in that.

526
00:34:19,217 --> 00:34:21,819
But one must be ready.
Is a very large commitment.

527
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,021
And if you are not ready, alone are...

528
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:27,057
an old solitary one with a
Very expensive ship by paying.

529
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:30,050
¿Who says that you have to be alone?

530
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:01,455
- ¡Hello!
- ¡Hello!

531
00:35:01,493 --> 00:35:03,427
Did not it know that you were at home.

532
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:06,530
All in the work
they went to drink, but...

533
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:10,100
that place where they go not me
Likes. Neither they neither.

534
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:12,703
OK, we will remain at home and
we will see some of those movies...

535
00:35:12,704 --> 00:35:14,405
To drink that you like.

536
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:17,398
Yes.

537
00:35:19,444 --> 00:35:21,708
I smell something.

538
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,738
¿You smell something?

539
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,484
Tripp and I... we have lunch crab.

540
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,988
Not, is not that.

541
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:34,014
I smell diversion.

542
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:38,323
- ¿What?
- You Are a dirty amusing one.

543
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,170
That is absurd. Tripp
Is a fascinating case.

544
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:46,437
- Does Not it fit in the usual profile.
- ¿Losing immature?

545
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:48,672
Not even I understand
Why lives at home.

546
00:35:48,673 --> 00:35:51,341
Has a good work,
Normal social habits.

547
00:35:51,342 --> 00:35:53,810
Is... attraction.

548
00:35:53,845 --> 00:35:56,837
Very sweet.

549
00:35:57,982 --> 00:36:02,842
Is pleasant that come out with
Someone so candy every day.

550
00:36:06,024 --> 00:36:10,120
Was a day of work
Successful. That is all.

551
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:13,559
- Well.
- AND al final of the day...

552
00:36:13,598 --> 00:36:16,590
I looked at to the eyes and I saw it.

553
00:36:18,036 --> 00:36:22,496
I have it hitched. That
Already is being moved from house.

554
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:27,373
It was finished. I have to leave it.

555
00:36:27,412 --> 00:36:29,546
- ¿You Will Leave Paula?
- ¿What happened?

556
00:36:29,547 --> 00:36:33,217
Same old the same thing. All
goes well and with facility...

557
00:36:33,218 --> 00:36:36,210
We pass it and suddenly, of the nothing.

558
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:39,056
It is put serious. I hate to tell it, small.

559
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:43,127
- But it is hour to carry it home.
- You do It again.

560
00:36:43,128 --> 00:36:44,528
- ¿What?
- That thing.

561
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:47,831
The woman itself about and you
You put an end to the relation.

562
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:50,952
Small, is simple.
The diversion was finished.

563
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:54,361
Look at that.

564
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,100
¡Hello, small!

565
00:36:58,143 --> 00:37:01,078
They see here, they see here.

566
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:04,471
¿What tells me, Demo?

567
00:37:05,116 --> 00:37:07,846
- ¿Where you were?
- ¿Where was?

568
00:37:07,886 --> 00:37:10,120
- I will ask You something, Demo.
- ¿Yes?

569
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:13,113
¿How surfeamos without waves?

570
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:25,802
- ¿We Go after him?
- Now is a passenger.

571
00:37:25,803 --> 00:37:29,163
¿Passing? It it was carried
To an underwater trip.

572
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:32,499
¡You carry me to my!

573
00:37:36,014 --> 00:37:38,415
Crap, that son of dog bit me.

574
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:41,283
¡Was, was!

575
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:45,415
- ¿A dolphin bit You?
- Yes. And is not any dolphin.

576
00:37:46,124 --> 00:37:49,116
Was a gigantic white dolphin.

577
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:52,853
I am lucky of still be alive.

578
00:37:57,368 --> 00:38:00,303
¿What?

579
00:38:00,972 --> 00:38:03,964
Nothing.

580
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:09,872
- Go. This is your house?
- Yes.

581
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:12,644

00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:32,836
Hello mom, dad. I thought that they would leave?

589
00:38:32,837 --> 00:38:36,000
¿To leave? Not, we premiere
The new chairs.

It smells well and I have a lot of hunger. You not?

606
00:39:42,307 --> 00:39:45,442
I am hungry, but my
Mom, this... she cooks.

00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:47,411
As it does almost every night.

608

The same house in which I grew.

611
00:39:54,419 --> 00:39:56,910
That is pretty.

612
00:39:56,954 --> 00:39:59,081

00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:51,365
That will not happen.

629
00:40:53,277 --> 00:40:56,269
Paula... affection...

630
00:40:57,081 --> 00:41:00,201
I thank you that you
You have remained to have dinner.

631
00:41:00,218 --> 00:41:03,019
- Should have been very uncomfortable.
- For nothing.

632
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,012
¿For nothing?

633
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,261
¿It does not matter to you that
My parents be down?

634
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:14,254
They sleep in their chairs.

635
00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:18,734
- Do Not look at.
- Payment by her. I look at if I want.

636
00:41:24,242 --> 00:41:27,234
Alone I say that... they would be able oírnos.

637
00:41:28,246 --> 00:41:31,238
¿Why? You are of the ones that they shout?

638
00:42:06,617 --> 00:42:09,609
¿Paula?

639
00:42:10,855 --> 00:42:12,880
¡They are awake!

640
00:42:12,924 --> 00:42:16,884
They raise themselves early. Listen,
News. All is well.

641
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:19,129
The things are well. Tripp is well.

642
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,965
In fact is fantastic,
I do not have that to tell them to him.

643
00:42:21,966 --> 00:42:24,958
They are their parents. Alone intent to say...

644
00:42:25,036 --> 00:42:28,028
That they should be very proud of him.

645
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:31,164
Good... they have a precious house.

646
00:42:40,585 --> 00:42:43,945
Young lady, pardon. Not
It can eat in the store.

647
00:43:10,648 --> 00:43:14,217
I need to buy a weapon.
¿How much is this grandota?

648
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:17,578
Is a shotgun caliber
Twelve. Is very powerful.

649
00:43:17,655 --> 00:43:21,024
For a woman of its size,
I would recommend something but...

650
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:22,890
Compact.

651
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:25,919
Alone I aim, predicament the trigger. Bum!

652
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,825
- Yes. Why goes him to shoot?
- ¿1200 dollars?

653
00:43:30,268 --> 00:43:33,260
¿How much they are worth the bullets?

654
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,675
Cartridges. The shotguns use cartridges.

655
00:43:38,676 --> 00:43:40,109
As be.

656
00:43:40,144 --> 00:43:42,078
- 15 dollars the box of 25 cartridges.
- OK.

657
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,845
I do not need all the box,
Alone I need... one.

658
00:43:49,654 --> 00:43:52,646
¿Something it knows?

659
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:57,050
At times I also look sad.

660
00:43:57,361 --> 00:44:00,296
There are many pressures in the life.

661
00:44:00,598 --> 00:44:04,334
¿I can give him the telephone of
Who could help... it?

662
00:44:04,335 --> 00:44:06,769
- Not, not.
- A helpline.

663
00:44:06,804 --> 00:44:09,796
Listens, ray of sun. I not...

664
00:44:10,308 --> 00:44:13,937
I am suicidal. I have a
Problem with a sinsonte.

665
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:17,878
¡OK!

666
00:44:17,915 --> 00:44:20,917
- It can Not kill a sinsonte.
- ¿Why not?

667
00:44:20,918 --> 00:44:23,920
In the first place, by the book
"To kill a sinsonte".

668
00:44:23,921 --> 00:44:26,913
- You Give me a copy.
- Is Not a manual.

669
00:44:28,025 --> 00:44:32,018
Is an American novel
Classical. It do not you know?

670
00:44:34,065 --> 00:44:36,466
- I Know many things. You give me the weapon!
- ¡Not!

671
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:38,447
- ¡Yes!
- I will Not be sold it.

672
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:41,438
The sinsontes are protected
By migratory federal laws.

673
00:44:41,439 --> 00:44:44,841
- To Kill one s a crime.
- Look at, this is an insanity.

674
00:44:44,842 --> 00:44:48,578
I have also the right. Such
Time does not know the 6ta amendment.

675
00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:51,571
¿Right to a fast public judgment?

676
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:55,542
You... are in my list.

677
00:44:56,354 --> 00:44:59,534
¡I bought some marvelous
Shoes to sail!

678
00:44:59,924 --> 00:45:01,892
Hello.

679
00:45:01,926 --> 00:45:03,393
¿What is happening?

680
00:45:03,394 --> 00:45:06,696
Nothing. I bought shoes for the
Next time that sail with Tripp.

681
00:45:06,697 --> 00:45:09,799
And not alone they are pretty.
Tripp says that they are practical.

682
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,901
They have some cositas in the
fund and Tripp says that...

683
00:45:11,902 --> 00:45:14,462
Expects, wait, slowly. You look at.

684
00:45:14,505 --> 00:45:17,497
- ¿What happened last night?
- ¿What happened last night?

685
00:45:18,142 --> 00:45:21,202
- I Tried to finish with her.
- ¿AND you failed?

686
00:45:21,746 --> 00:45:23,771
Yes.

687
00:45:23,814 --> 00:45:26,374
The sex was fantastic.

688
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:28,317
¿You had sex with him?

689
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:31,082
Is not much.

690
00:45:31,122 --> 00:45:34,724
¿And that rule of never
Having sex with the clients?

691
00:45:34,725 --> 00:45:37,845
Oh, yes. Never I have
Sex with my clients.

692
00:45:38,129 --> 00:45:42,509
They are my rules. The change if
Is necessary. I know what I do.

693
00:45:43,067 --> 00:45:46,907
- Your parents were not at home.
- Not, they were down.

694
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,200
- ¿AND you up?
- Yes.

695
00:45:52,243 --> 00:45:57,163
Looks, I continue in control. He was thing of
Once, situation of emergency.

696
00:45:57,948 --> 00:46:01,584
Is very complicated, now not
I have time to explain you...

697
00:46:01,585 --> 00:46:03,286
As the business functions.

698
00:46:03,287 --> 00:46:05,789
Do not you have that
Explain it to me, I am not an idiot.

699
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,348
I have a contract.

00:46:07,391 --> 00:46:10,690
I have fiduciary responsibilities.

701
00:46:11,429 --> 00:46:15,449
¿And since the point of view
Fiduciary, you had orgasms?

702
00:46:18,202 --> 00:46:20,537
¿Habábamos with you? Not. Clean that.

703
00:46:20,538 --> 00:46:23,530
¿We can speak of this in another part?

704
00:46:24,842 --> 00:46:27,834
It does not it matter, they can be remained if they want.

705
00:46:30,614 --> 00:46:33,606
- ¿AND now what will you do?
- Do Not I know it.

706
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:37,343
I am in small, unexplored territory.

707
00:46:37,822 --> 00:46:40,423
My mom believes that he is his
Dog, but I I do him all.

708
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:43,827
- Does Not comb to a setter Irish.
- ¿You Have a setter Irish?

709
00:46:43,828 --> 00:46:45,962
¡I have a yellow farm laborer!

710
00:46:45,963 --> 00:46:49,023
Is somewhat old, but
We should meet them.

711
00:46:51,736 --> 00:46:54,603
I have so much luck. A lot of luck.

712
00:46:54,638 --> 00:46:57,505
You look at. And you look at to my.

713
00:46:57,541 --> 00:47:01,307
We go, you look at. You are
Intelligent, attractive.

714
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:05,014
You like the original trilogy
of The Star Wars...

715
00:47:05,015 --> 00:47:08,618
because it is about counting the
history and the myth before...

716
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:11,788
the special effects it
They ruined all. We go!

717
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:14,090
¿What woman did not want to be with you?

718
00:47:14,091 --> 00:47:16,893
- Therefore are many.
- They are lost it.

719
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:18,995
You show me a man that he likes
"The Empire Counterattacks", and is...

720
00:47:18,996 --> 00:47:21,798
a man that him not
It fears to the imagination.

721
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:25,301
¡As when Luke arrives at the cave,
And it asks to Yoda what there is!

722
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:27,793
And Yoda says... him

723
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:30,830
Alone what you carry with you.

724
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:34,911
But he enters of all forms,
Because him does not he fear to his mind.

725
00:47:34,912 --> 00:47:37,313
To walk the road
Of the Jedi, for that.

726
00:47:37,314 --> 00:47:40,306
¡That are you! You are Luke!

727
00:47:44,054 --> 00:47:46,856
- I have to do pipi.
- ¿Do Not you have just gone?

728
00:47:46,857 --> 00:47:49,849
Immediately return. You do not go. OK?

729
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:53,387
- I will Not go anywhere.
- Fantastic.

730
00:47:53,464 --> 00:47:56,456
But in serious, you do not be going to go.

731
00:48:08,979 --> 00:48:10,571
¡Hello, Paula!

732
00:48:10,614 --> 00:48:13,549
¡My God! Crap!

733
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:16,576
You frightened me terribly.

734
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,712
¿What do you do? Do not you come around here often.

735
00:48:20,391 --> 00:48:23,383
Alone... already you know...

736
00:48:23,894 --> 00:48:26,886
Having lunch with a friend.

737
00:48:27,631 --> 00:48:30,623
¿Always you caress them the hands?

738
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:33,993
Not, I touched them. Alone I touched them.

739
00:48:34,905 --> 00:48:37,897
My friends never touch me the hands.

740
00:48:41,312 --> 00:48:44,304
You put me in a very difficult position.

741
00:48:49,153 --> 00:48:52,145
OK. What do you want?

742
00:48:55,626 --> 00:48:56,888
Not.

743
00:48:56,927 --> 00:48:59,529
Alone they will drink coffee. Not
You have to marry him.

744
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:02,165
In the first place, is the
Fool of the computers.

745
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:05,368
Is sufficiently evil to come out with
A loser that lives with its mother.

746
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:08,669
And on top you told me
That was a handsome vague one.

747
00:49:10,574 --> 00:49:13,566
Not, do not I believe to have done that.

748
00:49:14,578 --> 00:49:17,213
Did not have option. Itself it
was going to tell Tripp...

749
00:49:17,214 --> 00:49:19,616
And you are my unique one puts on file of negotiation.

750
00:49:19,617 --> 00:49:22,485
- You should take it as a polite one.
- Is a gnome.

751
00:49:22,486 --> 00:49:25,387
Is not a gnome, is... is...

752
00:49:25,422 --> 00:49:28,619
Is cariñosito and... rare.

753
00:49:29,927 --> 00:49:32,589
By love of God.

754
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,622
¡Already I go!

755
00:49:48,646 --> 00:49:51,274
I expect that you like the fish.

756
00:49:51,315 --> 00:49:54,495
¿And how Paula does
That? Seems to be difficult.

757
00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:57,720
¿Does not it confuse that life with its real life?

758
00:49:57,721 --> 00:50:01,021
¿What causes thinks you
That has a real life?

759
00:50:02,526 --> 00:50:06,726
Is a somewhat strange work.
¿How one enters that field?

760
00:50:08,832 --> 00:50:11,267
It does a pair of years itself
fell in love with a type...

761
00:50:11,268 --> 00:50:13,937
that did not want to leave of
Living with its parents. I do not know.

762
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:15,838
I suppose that as did not be able
fix it him, fixes...

763
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,079
to the other losers
That there is there outside.

764
00:50:19,343 --> 00:50:22,335
- Do Not offend you.
- I will Not do it.

765
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:27,750
- If you want to go you, I understand it.
- It Forgives that the door closed you.

766
00:50:27,751 --> 00:50:30,743
I not am not... sleeping well.

767
00:50:32,456 --> 00:50:34,424
¿Really?

768
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:38,656
I neither. I have a lot
on top, and my head...

769
00:50:38,896 --> 00:50:41,888
Not, not.

770
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,002
Not, I want to sleep. But not
I am able because there is a bird...

771
00:50:46,003 --> 00:50:49,772

All the night. And pious, and pious...

772
00:50:49,773 --> 00:50:52,765
And I bother me and not achievement that be silenced.

773
00:50:57,414 --> 00:51:00,414
I have a shotgun
Of air compressed.

774
00:51:06,757 --> 00:51:09,749
¡Thus it is done!

775
00:51:11,228 --> 00:51:13,128
Yes.

776
00:51:13,163 --> 00:51:16,155
¿You received my message?

777
00:51:16,834 --> 00:51:18,935
Not. ¿you Know what? I have
The dull telephone.

778
00:51:18,936 --> 00:51:21,905
I spent the night with a friend.

779
00:51:21,939 --> 00:51:24,640
My teacher, the Miss.
Kent, has a friend.

780
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:27,633
- That is pretty.
- Are lesbians.

781
00:51:28,178 --> 00:51:32,048
You do not do the one that it does not matter to you.
You are jealous because you like.

782
00:51:32,049 --> 00:51:35,041
You are the one that the neckline looks him.

783
00:51:35,352 --> 00:51:38,344
Lies.

784
00:51:47,064 --> 00:51:49,123
I do not listen anything.

785
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:51,828
Will come.

786
00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:54,861
He always comes.

787
00:51:55,105 --> 00:51:58,097
¿As many times you charged it?

788
00:51:59,076 --> 00:52:00,509
Two times.

789
00:52:00,544 --> 00:52:04,624
For kill it not, alone to do him
Damage and that go far away.

790
00:52:06,316 --> 00:52:09,183
Yes.

791
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:12,245
¿Kit is the abbreviation of Catherine?

792
00:52:14,224 --> 00:52:19,560
Yes. The abbreviation of
Toolbox.

793
00:52:20,831 --> 00:52:24,851
- Is Not an abbreviation.
- ¿You Play cards or something?

794
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:29,771
To the 10 years I had a
Testicle that did not descend.

795
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:40,239
¡Wait!

796
00:52:41,385 --> 00:52:43,546
There you are.

797
00:52:43,587 --> 00:52:46,579
Until tomorrow, little bird.

798
00:52:47,891 --> 00:52:50,883
I gave him.

799
00:52:51,695 --> 00:52:54,687
¿You charged it but of two times, truth?

800
00:52:56,467 --> 00:52:59,527
¡By God! Why
You left me to do that?

801
00:53:02,506 --> 00:53:03,739
- ¿Is well?
- Do Not I know it.

802
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,841
- ¿Where did we give him?
- ¡Do Not I know it!

803
00:53:04,842 --> 00:53:06,609
- ¿Is dead?
- I, I...

804
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:08,908
¡Not!

805
00:53:08,946 --> 00:53:11,676
Looks, sight... the pellet.

806
00:53:11,715 --> 00:53:13,616
Then alone we gave him a blow.
¿You know to resurrect the heart?

807
00:53:13,617 --> 00:53:15,118
- Yes, but...
- Do it.

00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,984
- Is a bird.

809
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:20,260
Revising vital signs.
¿Where is the pulse?

810
00:53:20,524 --> 00:53:23,159
- To Revise respiratory ways.
- ¡Do Not do him damage!

811
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,661
¡Do not I do him damage, do not I know what I do!

812
00:53:25,662 --> 00:53:27,563
OK, suavecito. Is tiny.

813
00:53:27,564 --> 00:53:30,556
My God, does not function. Dies!

814
00:53:30,734 --> 00:53:32,635
¡Do something! We lose al patient!

815
00:53:32,636 --> 00:53:35,628
¡Not if I am on guard!

816
00:53:37,341 --> 00:53:39,536
One, two, three...

817
00:53:39,576 --> 00:53:42,568
¡You move away of the light, amiguito!

818
00:53:42,946 --> 00:53:45,938
One, two, three...

819
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:17,407
I am hungry.

820
00:54:17,447 --> 00:54:21,517
You ate frituritas, two dogs
Hot and a market of peanut.

821
00:54:21,518 --> 00:54:24,510
- Did Not I take ice cream.
- My Error.

822
00:54:25,022 --> 00:54:26,923
Well. I can eat a
Bar of dry fruits?

823
00:54:26,924 --> 00:54:29,893
That is good, learns to negotiate.

824
00:54:29,927 --> 00:54:32,293
- We Go.
- ¡You Expect me!

825
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:34,991
We ask if Paula needs something.

826
00:54:35,032 --> 00:54:37,533
Perhaps a finger of
Telephone Royal number one.

827
00:54:37,534 --> 00:54:40,526
Do not you return without one.

828
00:54:48,045 --> 00:54:50,446
Tripp and Jeffie they are seen very pretty together.

829
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:53,382
Yes. Listens, when have a
minute, I want to speak with you...

832
00:54:58,755 --> 00:55:03,375

Passion by something that you does not interest.

833
00:55:03,493 --> 00:55:07,753
- Sight, I do not know what you listened...
- Ace counted it me all.

834
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:11,123
You do not worry, I have not betrayed you.

835
00:55:11,702 --> 00:55:14,762
The truth is that support
Your final objective.

836
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:18,507
But if truly you want
help it, and I believe that you want...

837
00:55:18,508 --> 00:55:20,910
you have to know the facts
Concrete. Beginning for the fact...

838
00:55:20,911 --> 00:55:24,031
that Jeffrey is not
The nephew of Tripp.

839
00:55:24,348 --> 00:55:26,373
¿You have heard to speak of Amy?

840
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:31,251
Amy was its first love, and died
Six years ago. You did not tell it?

841
00:55:36,326 --> 00:55:38,191
¡My God!

842
00:55:38,228 --> 00:55:41,220
I am the worst person of the world.

843
00:55:43,267 --> 00:55:45,497
Hello. You arrived at house.

844
00:55:45,535 --> 00:55:47,870
- I am happy.
- I have to leave Tripp.

845
00:55:47,871 --> 00:55:51,051
I will cancel my contract
And... I cannot do it.

846
00:55:52,876 --> 00:55:55,868
- ¿What happened here?
- Nothing, I tripped.

847
00:55:56,246 --> 00:55:59,238
It continues counting your history.

848
00:56:01,518 --> 00:56:04,510
Tripp was compromised to be married.

849
00:56:05,088 --> 00:56:07,989
- OK.
- AND Jeffrey, its nephew...

850
00:56:08,025 --> 00:56:11,385
Is not its nephew. Not
They are a family at all.

851
00:56:11,428 --> 00:56:15,631
Jeffrey is a son of the woman
that he was going to marry with Tripp...

852
00:56:15,632 --> 00:56:18,624
And died.

853
00:56:18,702 --> 00:56:21,694
- That is very sad.
- I know It.

854
00:56:22,306 --> 00:56:25,104
¿To whom imports him?

855
00:56:25,142 --> 00:56:28,562
- ¿Excuse?
- Never you spoke thus of a client.

856
00:56:29,346 --> 00:56:32,946
- Do Not I know which is the problem with this.
- Because...

857
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:35,941
He passed through a real tragedy.

858
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:42,052
Tripp is not the client
Adequate. Is an ethical problem.

859
00:56:46,129 --> 00:56:49,121
¿Who is that?

860
00:56:49,766 --> 00:56:52,758
¿What?

861
00:56:53,737 --> 00:56:56,729
In... is Phillip.

862
00:56:57,941 --> 00:57:00,637
¿Who is Phillip?

863
00:57:00,677 --> 00:57:03,669
- Phillip is...
- I...

864
00:57:08,618 --> 00:57:11,610
¿I said that you could leave?

865
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:16,382
Good, good, good.

866
00:57:16,893 --> 00:57:19,885
- Is pleasant.
- That is pleasant.

867
00:57:20,597 --> 00:57:23,897
It looks, I do not see the
Complication. You like Tripp.

868
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,992
Dile that you like.

869
00:57:27,104 --> 00:57:30,584
I should I tell you something. Him
I counted to Paula it of Amy.

870
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:34,700
¿What? Why?

871
00:57:35,112 --> 00:57:38,292
You never would do it.
Neither you mention its name.

872
00:57:38,515 --> 00:57:41,317
Amy is its former-promised.
Died six years ago.

873
00:57:41,318 --> 00:57:44,678
- To Lose a love is the major pain.
- Thus is.

874
00:57:45,155 --> 00:57:47,456
If you cry is well. We veered.

875
00:57:47,457 --> 00:57:50,449
I am well, small.

876
00:57:53,864 --> 00:57:56,856
Did not you have the right. That is... Is my life.

877
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:59,869
You are right. And normally
I believe that all they have the right...

878
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:02,671
To walk its own road.
But you are not in yours.

879
00:58:02,672 --> 00:58:06,272
¿OK? You are seated close
Of the road, in a rock.

880
00:58:06,576 --> 00:58:09,078
It is the unique thing that could do,
They given the circumstances.

881
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:11,547
¿Circumstances?

882
00:58:11,581 --> 00:58:14,316
That it is the other thing that I should I say you.

883
00:58:14,317 --> 00:58:17,386
I feel badly, because I told him
To Paula that would not say anything.

884
00:58:17,387 --> 00:58:20,923
The deceit is a poison, not
I can have it in my body.

885
00:58:20,924 --> 00:58:23,916
Damned be, al grain. We go.

886
00:58:24,694 --> 00:58:28,894
Your parents hired to Paula
So that go of house.

887
00:58:29,299 --> 00:58:31,333
That is crap. Of what do you speak?

888
00:58:31,334 --> 00:58:34,103
- They paid Him for being your girlfriend.
- ¿TO Paula?

889
00:58:34,104 --> 00:58:37,096
Yes. Is a professional. Is its work.

890
00:58:41,011 --> 00:58:44,131
- ¿You are telling Me that is not real?
- Not.

891
00:58:45,148 --> 00:58:48,140
¡Not, is real! Very real.

892
00:58:48,218 --> 00:58:52,221
OK, you are uncomfortable. Looks but
there of the sense of treason...

893
00:58:52,222 --> 00:58:54,256
¡You focus you in the future! OK?

894
00:58:54,257 --> 00:58:56,025
I believe that you are able
Resolving this. In serious.

895
00:58:56,026 --> 00:58:59,018
I believe that the two have an opportunity.

896
00:59:05,368 --> 00:59:08,360
- ¿You are leaving It to cook?
- Yes.

897
00:59:09,673 --> 00:59:13,973
- Strange. You know what?
- It Smells well.

898
00:59:14,978 --> 00:59:17,970
I know it.

899
00:59:19,382 --> 00:59:22,374
¿They can open?

900
00:59:24,187 --> 00:59:27,667
Hello, did not it know... not...
It knew that they would be here.

901
00:59:27,924 --> 00:59:30,449
We neither. Ahead.

902
00:59:30,494 --> 00:59:32,528
- Thanks.
- Tripp is in the kitchen.

903
00:59:32,529 --> 00:59:35,521
Well.

904
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:47,233
Hello, my girl. They see here.

905
00:59:48,345 --> 00:59:51,465

- A small... family supper.

906
00:59:52,415 --> 00:59:55,535
All the people to
the ones that but I want...

907
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:58,619

Room. Very good.

908
00:59:58,922 --> 01:00:01,618
Listens. We can speak?

909
01:00:01,658 --> 01:00:04,660
Of course, we will speak a lot
In the supper. Right now...

910
01:00:04,661 --> 01:00:06,526
I am cooking.

911
01:00:06,563 --> 01:00:09,555
¡Mom, dad! They want but came?

912
01:00:10,634 --> 01:00:13,626
- Suffices, suffices. -
A little but for T-I.

913
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:17,510
- Tripp, I do not know that to say.
- Do Not speak thus, mom.

914
01:00:19,676 --> 01:00:23,276
I did this beautiful supper today
Give them the thanks.

915
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,180
To the people that
I want but. All you.

916
01:00:27,684 --> 01:00:29,914
Is a blessing. Mom.

917
01:00:29,953 --> 01:00:31,215
Dad.

918
01:00:31,254 --> 01:00:32,551
Affection.

919
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:35,581
That is well, son.

920
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,852
Ahead.

921
01:00:45,302 --> 01:00:48,962
I am too much touched.
I have to announce something.

922
01:00:55,278 --> 01:00:57,269
Paula...

923
01:00:57,314 --> 01:01:00,181
the last weeks...

924
01:01:00,216 --> 01:01:03,208
that I have passed with you, they have been...

925
01:01:03,453 --> 01:01:05,683
Incredible.

926
01:01:05,722 --> 01:01:08,020
Surprising.

927
01:01:08,058 --> 01:01:10,185
Happy.

928
01:01:10,226 --> 01:01:13,024
And surprising.

929
01:01:13,063 --> 01:01:16,055
I mean that thanks to you...

930
01:01:18,535 --> 01:01:22,135
there I am experienced emotions
That neither knew that had.

931
01:01:26,543 --> 01:01:28,777
So they say that I am crazy...

932
01:01:28,778 --> 01:01:31,770
But I believe that we should live together.

933
01:01:33,049 --> 01:01:35,449
¡That is my boy!

934
01:01:35,485 --> 01:01:38,352
¿You want water, affection?

935
01:01:38,388 --> 01:01:41,380
- Thanks.
- Is marvelous.

936
01:01:41,658 --> 01:01:43,993
I am very proud of you, son.

937
01:01:43,994 --> 01:01:48,597
Well. And the thing is, mom and dad, that
It lived there up since the 3 years.

938
01:01:48,598 --> 01:01:50,998
And has been marvelous.

939
01:01:51,067 --> 01:01:54,570
You two are the better
Parents that a son could want.

940
01:01:54,571 --> 01:01:57,563
Alone I expect to be able to give him my children...

941
01:02:01,511 --> 01:02:03,672
Our children.

942
01:02:03,713 --> 01:02:08,446
The half of the love and the
respect, comprehension and support...

943
01:02:09,552 --> 01:02:12,544
That you two have given me to my.

944
01:02:12,622 --> 01:02:16,402
What I mean is
that is hour that Tripp...

945
01:02:17,127 --> 01:02:20,119
Open the wings.

946
01:02:27,737 --> 01:02:30,729
This is very unexpected.

947
01:02:31,274 --> 01:02:35,844
This is the plan. We fall the room
of the east, we expand the bath...

948
01:02:35,845 --> 01:02:40,045
and we convert all the second
Flat in a suite main.

949
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:44,453
So that there be space for
You two, and for us two.

950
01:02:44,454 --> 01:02:47,446
Under the same ceiling. What seems them?

951
01:02:54,464 --> 01:02:56,432
I do not understand.

952
01:02:56,466 --> 01:02:58,701
- ¿You Want that Paula come to live here?
- ¡Yes!

953
01:02:58,702 --> 01:03:01,437
Is the perfect solution. Mom,
Dad. to falls them you well.

954
01:03:01,438 --> 01:03:03,305
Paula, to you they fall you well.

955
01:03:03,306 --> 01:03:07,009
We will be all here, under a
Alone ceiling, a great happy family.

956
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:10,446
- I Am very touched with this.
- Wait, wait a second.

957
01:03:10,447 --> 01:03:14,516
- Breathes deep...
- Tripp, I believe that we should speak...

958
01:03:14,517 --> 01:03:16,652
Because the idea is very large and...

959
01:03:16,653 --> 01:03:19,178
I have thought it a lot. Will function.

960
01:03:19,222 --> 01:03:21,281
And the best part is...

961
01:03:21,324 --> 01:03:24,191
Mom, dad.

962
01:03:24,227 --> 01:03:28,787
That they will not have to pay him but
To Paula so that be my girlfriend.

963
01:03:33,369 --> 01:03:36,361
¿I said somewhat bad? We go.

964
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:38,903
All they have what want.

965
01:03:38,942 --> 01:03:42,242
Paula, no longer you have
That to pretend that you flavor.

966
01:03:42,545 --> 01:03:45,537
And mom and dad. They wanted that was me.

967
01:03:49,853 --> 01:03:52,845
I go.

968
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:08,393
¡Tripp, wait!

969
01:04:08,638 --> 01:04:11,630
¡Tripp!

970
01:04:12,008 --> 01:04:15,000
I do not want to listen you.

971
01:04:16,846 --> 01:04:19,781
Please. Do not you understand.

972
01:04:19,816 --> 01:04:21,909
You are right. Expects.

973
01:04:21,951 --> 01:04:24,943
cNo I know as much as you charge for day, but...

974
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:28,257
this is everything that
I carry on top. 300 dollars.

975
01:04:28,258 --> 01:04:31,059
- ¡We Go, Tripp!
- ¿Suffices for this night?

976
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,162
Above all because we did not have sex.

977
01:04:33,163 --> 01:04:37,243
- Please, you leave me to explain you.
- Salt of my damned car.

978
01:05:28,117 --> 01:05:30,018
Good, your parents paid him money.

979
01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:33,121
My grandfathers pay to my
Kangaroo and i like equal.

980
01:05:33,122 --> 01:05:36,024
I cheer me by you. We speak of another thing.

981
01:05:36,025 --> 01:05:39,017
Well. The 32 is pleasant.

982
01:05:41,464 --> 01:05:44,466
But I believe that I see me
To my same one in a 37.

983
01:05:44,467 --> 01:05:47,827
- ¿What your you believe?
- Do Not buy a ship, friend.

984
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:50,999
They I love the ships.

985
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:55,360
Not, not the ships they charm you.
You like the idea of the ship.

986
01:05:56,746 --> 01:06:00,382
The reality is that they spend
your time, your wallet...

987
01:06:00,383 --> 01:06:02,476
And your emotions.

988
01:06:02,518 --> 01:06:05,282
And al final, the heart will break you.

989
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:08,991
Because it does not matter as much as the
You want, she does not want you.

990
01:06:08,992 --> 01:06:11,984
You look at, is a boat. Is of wood.

991
01:06:13,096 --> 01:06:15,831
You do not buy a ship.
¿You want to feel pain?

992
01:06:15,832 --> 01:06:18,824
You close you the door of the car in the hand.

993
01:06:19,903 --> 01:06:23,739
That is the type of things that
They say: "Alive with my mother".

994
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:25,571
- ¿What?
- In serious.

995
01:06:25,608 --> 01:06:28,600
I tell it you as the friend.

996
01:06:29,612 --> 01:06:34,832
If you say those foolishness in the park
Of play, not hard nor 10 minutes.

997
01:06:34,918 --> 01:06:38,353
Thank you so much for to give me
Some minutes of your time.

998
01:06:38,354 --> 01:06:40,856
- ¿Why you do not sit down?
- Not, not.

999
01:06:40,857 --> 01:06:43,849
Thanks, not. Alone I want to give them this.

1000
01:06:46,129 --> 01:06:48,324
- ¿What is?
- Your money.

1001
01:06:48,364 --> 01:06:50,866
I am returned them. I know that
this will not fix anything...

1002
01:06:50,867 --> 01:06:53,495
And I know that nothing will be able. But...

1003
01:06:53,536 --> 01:06:57,739
They given the circumstances not
Sits down me well to remain me with him.

1004
01:06:57,740 --> 01:07:00,675
In serious, please, take it.

1005
01:07:02,712 --> 01:07:05,044
- ¿What?
- This never it passed me.

1006
01:07:05,081 --> 01:07:08,441
I want that they know it.
Seemed a simple case.

1007
01:07:09,385 --> 01:07:12,354
I suppose that I trusted me too much.

1008
01:07:12,388 --> 01:07:15,585
It do not I know, he... Not
it answers my calls...

1009
01:07:18,895 --> 01:07:22,675
I continue thinking about that all
the time, I do not know where...

1010
01:07:25,735 --> 01:07:28,727
You are lover of our son.

1011
01:07:38,314 --> 01:07:41,306
We go, we will scale some rocks. Rises.

1012
01:07:41,617 --> 01:07:43,278
Not.

1013
01:07:43,319 --> 01:07:46,311
You carry two weeks of mourning. We go.

1014
01:07:47,924 --> 01:07:52,424
¡Tripp, we go, is open!
It wants that among. It enters al car!

1015
01:07:53,529 --> 01:07:55,997
¿Is not marvelous this, small?

1016
01:07:56,032 --> 01:07:59,024
¿How goes you, Tripp? You feel it?

1017
01:07:59,902 --> 01:08:03,772
- This rock is pleasant.
- Is happy Me that we have come.

1018
01:08:03,773 --> 01:08:06,765
- Yes.
- We Go well. It is amused.

1019
01:08:11,381 --> 01:08:13,941
¿They want some zanahorias?

1020
01:08:13,983 --> 01:08:17,316
Tripp, you should call
To Paula. It wants to see you.

1021
01:08:17,887 --> 01:08:20,879
Already suffices, Demo.

1022
01:08:21,524 --> 01:08:24,516
¡The cord, Ace!

1023
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:30,522
Continues with your ballet.

1024
01:08:35,405 --> 01:08:37,737
She also feels very badly.

1025
01:08:37,774 --> 01:08:40,766
Is unhappy, Tripp.

1026
01:08:42,712 --> 01:08:45,704
Leave it to pass, small.

1027
01:09:03,299 --> 01:09:04,561
My error.

1028
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,669
I knew a specialist that
It sent me its patients.

1029
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:09,729
Alone they needed a push.

1030
01:09:09,772 --> 01:09:12,764
Looks, Paula, this has to stop.

1031
01:09:12,809 --> 01:09:15,877
Do not you sleep and the unique thing that you
I have seen to eat in three days...

1032
01:09:15,878 --> 01:09:18,870
Is a market of mints.

1033
01:09:19,382 --> 01:09:23,342
You do not worry about my. Me
I will go in a pair of weeks.

1034
01:09:24,587 --> 01:09:26,350
¿What? Where do you go?

1035
01:09:26,389 --> 01:09:29,153
Return to Red.

1036
01:09:29,192 --> 01:09:32,252
- ¿What will you do in Red?
- Not Yet I know it.

1037
01:09:33,262 --> 01:09:37,942
That is stupid. What will you do
In the meantime, to live with your parents?

1038
01:09:41,104 --> 01:09:43,664
That... is very badly.

1039
01:09:43,706 --> 01:09:46,504
Me do not judge. OK?

1040
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:49,534
You are not the but indicated. Very funny.

1041
01:09:49,812 --> 01:09:52,347
¿You know what? I am the one that
Has a real relation.

1042
01:09:52,348 --> 01:09:55,717
You lie to gain you the
Life. Believe you very intelligent...

1043
01:09:55,718 --> 01:09:59,354
But do not you know anything. You believed
That never they would discover you?

1044
01:09:59,355 --> 01:10:01,156
You could be happy, but
You spoiled it.

1045
01:10:01,157 --> 01:10:03,425
Now you act as its was
It blames of all the others.

1046
01:10:03,426 --> 01:10:06,328
But you are alone you. And you believe
That Red is the solution?

1047
01:10:06,329 --> 01:10:09,331
Kit, alone because al end you convinced
to someone to be gone to bed with you...

1048
01:10:09,332 --> 01:10:11,232
but immediately...

1049
01:10:11,267 --> 01:10:14,259
You not an expert in relations does.

1050
01:10:21,077 --> 01:10:24,069
Tripp...

1051
01:10:24,247 --> 01:10:27,239
- Returns, friend.
- Tripp...

1052
01:10:27,817 --> 01:10:30,809
Hello, friend.

1053
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:37,782
Hello, small.

1054
01:10:38,761 --> 01:10:43,141
A chokoala bit you. That
Never it passes. Is a reptile of peace.

1055
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:47,202
I have a theory. Is not the
First time that this passes you.

1056
01:10:47,203 --> 01:10:52,003
I believe that is because your life is
Incompatible with the natural world.

1057
01:10:53,476 --> 01:10:56,468
Therefore the nature rejects you.

1058
01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:00,515
You are crazy. They give me water?

1059
01:11:00,816 --> 01:11:03,808
Slowly.

1060
01:11:05,221 --> 01:11:07,822
I have travelled the entire world.
That I know, you are the unique one...

1061
01:11:07,823 --> 01:11:09,925
human that has been bitten for
a dolphin, an ardillita and a...

1062
01:11:09,926 --> 01:11:12,918
vegetarian lizard
During the same year.

1063
01:11:13,129 --> 01:11:16,364
And you are badly friend. Me not
you have asked never...

1064
01:11:16,365 --> 01:11:19,357
By my relation with Kit.

1065
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:26,198
Friend... ¿you Have just left me
Falling of 40 feet of height?

1066
01:11:26,976 --> 01:11:30,946
If we speak of friends, me
you betraied and used the blackmail...

1067
01:11:30,947 --> 01:11:33,643
To obtain a girlfriend.

1068
01:11:33,683 --> 01:11:35,742
Is right.

1069
01:11:35,785 --> 01:11:38,453
- Lament to have left to fall.
- It does not matter.

1070
01:11:38,454 --> 01:11:41,156
It is certain that utilized you,
But not by wickedness.

1071
01:11:41,157 --> 01:11:43,491
You look at. As many
Opportunities is going to have?

1072
01:11:43,492 --> 01:11:47,963
It saw an opportunity to love, and the
It took. It is what we want for you.

1073
01:11:47,964 --> 01:11:51,666
¿They give me counsel my two friends
Losing that live with their parents?

1074
01:11:51,667 --> 01:11:54,659
- I Am an owner of my house.
- ¿What?

1075
01:11:54,804 --> 01:11:57,839
I was bought from it mom does
Years. She has where to live...

1076
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,141
and then me do not they nail with
The tax of inheritance.

1077
01:12:00,142 --> 01:12:03,622
- Intelligent.
- AND Demo chose a wandering life.

1078
01:12:04,614 --> 01:12:07,249
- Technically still lives there...
- Yes.

1079
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:11,050
But he is able, because in
His heart... is a to wander.

1080
01:12:14,123 --> 01:12:17,926
I believe that we try to say that
we two are happy...

1081
01:12:17,927 --> 01:12:20,225
And completely functional.

1082
01:12:20,263 --> 01:12:22,925
And you, Tripp...

1083
01:12:22,965 --> 01:12:25,957
It you are not.

1084
01:12:37,647 --> 01:12:40,639
¡Mom!

1085
01:12:41,317 --> 01:12:44,309
¡Dad!

1086
01:13:00,536 --> 01:13:03,528
¿Dad?

1087
01:13:03,606 --> 01:13:05,507
Hello, Tripp. What do you do here?

1088
01:13:05,508 --> 01:13:08,500
I came to seek my things. What do you do?

1089
01:13:09,412 --> 01:13:12,404
- Feeding the fish.
- Already I see.

1090
01:13:15,017 --> 01:13:18,009
You are naked. In my room.

1091
01:13:19,622 --> 01:13:22,614
Is my naked room to be.

1092
01:13:23,059 --> 01:13:25,391
Is my house. And I can do...

1093
01:13:25,428 --> 01:13:28,420
What one want to do in its house.

1094
01:13:29,231 --> 01:13:32,634
- I Used clothes 40 years.
- Now we will have 40 but of...

1095
01:13:32,635 --> 01:13:35,627
- ¡Nothing of clothes!
- Nothing of clothes.

1096
01:13:35,838 --> 01:13:39,035
Is well. I will leave you
Feeding the fish.

1097
01:13:39,675 --> 01:13:42,667
Thanks by coming for here.

1098
01:13:43,245 --> 01:13:46,544
Dad, in serious. Was
So evil to have me here?

1099
01:13:49,485 --> 01:13:51,612
You be not an idiot, son.

1100
01:13:51,654 --> 01:13:54,856
- Your mother and I we want you.
They - ¿Why did not say something?

1101
01:13:54,857 --> 01:13:57,849
Alone they had that... to tell it to me.

1102
01:13:58,361 --> 01:14:01,296
You needed time later
Of the death of Amy, Tripp.

1103
01:14:01,297 --> 01:14:03,898
¿Who knows as much as
Time is the correct one?

1104
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:06,697
¿Two years, six years?

1105
01:14:06,736 --> 01:14:10,105
Then I found me with Bev and
Ours, they used to Paula.

1106
01:14:10,106 --> 01:14:13,075
And its son is very happy now.

1107
01:14:13,109 --> 01:14:17,129
I believe that lives in Seatlle.
Married a girl India.

1108
01:14:17,813 --> 01:14:20,077
In short...

1109
01:14:20,116 --> 01:14:21,913
Seemed but easy.

1110
01:14:21,951 --> 01:14:24,943
But easy.

1111
01:14:25,821 --> 01:14:28,415
Is well.

1112
01:14:28,457 --> 01:14:31,449
It hears...

1113
01:14:31,861 --> 01:14:34,963
i like what you have
Fact with this place.

1114
01:14:34,964 --> 01:14:37,732
- I like. I want you, son.
- AND I to you.

1115
01:14:37,733 --> 01:14:39,997
¡The hand swims but!

1116
01:14:40,035 --> 01:14:43,027
It continues frightening to the fish.

1117
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,831
It returns when want, son.

1118
01:14:52,381 --> 01:14:54,815
- Mom.
- Tripp.

1119
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:56,851
¿You have seen what there is there up?

1120
01:14:56,852 --> 01:14:58,853
Dad is naked in its naked room.

1121
01:14:58,854 --> 01:15:02,323
I know it, always wanted one.
It tried to do it in the dining room...

1122
01:15:02,324 --> 01:15:06,104
but I convinced it that the
First flat is problematic.

1123
01:15:07,897 --> 01:15:11,437
- ¿You Are well?
- Yes. I came to seek something of clothes.

1124
01:15:15,204 --> 01:15:18,196
I feel it.

1125
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:21,933
It was a very ugly thing what we did.

1126
01:15:24,413 --> 01:15:27,405
When we knew to Paula...

1127
01:15:27,716 --> 01:15:29,809
when we hire... it

1128
01:15:29,852 --> 01:15:32,377
I did not want that were you.

1129
01:15:32,421 --> 01:15:35,223
During years feared the
Day in which you were yourself.

1130
01:15:35,224 --> 01:15:38,464
Always I thought that you
It would throw a lot of less.

1131
01:15:38,828 --> 01:15:41,963
Then I realized that
Alone was a part of the all.

1132
01:15:41,964 --> 01:15:44,956
Did not it want that were you because...

1133
01:15:45,134 --> 01:15:48,126
Being alone with your father frightens me a lot.

1134
01:15:48,337 --> 01:15:50,572
- ¿What?
- I Am landfall, Tripp.

1135
01:15:50,573 --> 01:15:53,033
Is not alone by the naked room.

1136
01:15:53,042 --> 01:15:56,034
Since your father withdrew...

1137
01:15:57,046 --> 01:15:59,514
I am usual to have you here.

1138
01:15:59,548 --> 01:16:03,208
As a filter when your
Father is in a bad mood.

1139
01:16:05,821 --> 01:16:09,661
And now we have that
Learning to know us again.

1140
01:16:10,693 --> 01:16:13,685
And...

1141
01:16:21,203 --> 01:16:24,195
¿And if him not flavor?

1142
01:16:35,117 --> 01:16:38,109
¿Still you love it?

1143
01:16:39,622 --> 01:16:42,614
Against every forecast.

1144
01:16:43,225 --> 01:16:46,217
All will turn out well.

1145
01:17:00,175 --> 01:17:03,167
¡You are going to miss me!

1146
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:04,644
Is certain.

1147
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:08,880
I called them to all, because
Obviously we have a situation.

1148
01:17:08,918 --> 01:17:12,787
And all we feel heads,
But the fault is not the matter.

1149
01:17:12,788 --> 01:17:15,348
We have to find a solution.

1150
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:18,383
Two people that love pass it badly.

1151
01:17:18,994 --> 01:17:21,296
We are going to put us the caps to think.

1152
01:17:21,297 --> 01:17:24,597
- This shirt weighs as 100 pounds.
- ¡Albert!

1153
01:17:27,102 --> 01:17:28,763
¿What does this seem them?

1154
01:17:28,804 --> 01:17:32,706
We send flowers to
Paula in name of Tripp.

1155
01:17:33,742 --> 01:17:37,508
And flowers to Tripp in name of Paula.

1156
01:17:40,215 --> 01:17:42,911
- ¿AND then what?
- Then...

1157
01:17:42,952 --> 01:17:45,284
- They will love themselves.
- ¡Jesus!

1158
01:17:45,321 --> 01:17:47,687
By the flowers.

1159
01:17:47,723 --> 01:17:49,523
Thanks, Phillip. Now...

1160
01:17:49,525 --> 01:17:53,065
We go all to seek a
Plan that do not be idiot.

1161
01:17:56,932 --> 01:17:59,901
Hello.

1162
01:18:00,069 --> 01:18:03,061
Listens.

1163
01:18:03,606 --> 01:18:06,598
I revised all the CD. But if...

1164
01:18:06,675 --> 01:18:10,078
they remain some of mine
or I carry me some yours...

1165
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:12,445
We declare it a tie. OK?

1166
01:18:12,481 --> 01:18:14,574
OK. Sure.

1167
01:18:14,617 --> 01:18:17,484
OK.

1168
01:18:17,519 --> 01:18:20,283
- The hatred.
- I know It, I also.

1169
01:18:20,322 --> 01:18:23,883
Therefore... alone...

1170
01:18:25,894 --> 01:18:28,886
We finish with this immediately.

1171
01:18:31,033 --> 01:18:32,660
OK, sight.

1172
01:18:32,701 --> 01:18:35,503
I know that I am a girl and I should be
good with the emotional... crap

1173
01:18:35,504 --> 01:18:38,139
but it I am not, so
I will tell it. Lament that...

1174
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:41,380
I indicated you that you
you fell in love with a client...

1175
01:18:41,944 --> 01:18:46,264
and that that you to go crazy and
You to return a total dog.

1176
01:18:47,449 --> 01:18:50,441
Go.

1177
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:53,586
It should have been very difficult to say that.

1178
01:18:53,622 --> 01:18:57,162
I thought that would be it, but
Facility came out with me.

1179
01:18:59,628 --> 01:19:02,358
Therefore thanks.

1180
01:19:02,398 --> 01:19:05,458
And... I it lament
by to have indicated...

1181
01:19:05,601 --> 01:19:08,269
that you have not had a relation
in 5 years because I am...

1182
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:13,310
the only person that tolerates your
Strange and violent changes of spirit.

1183
01:19:14,009 --> 01:19:17,001
Thanks.

1184
01:19:18,881 --> 01:19:21,441
- Good-bye.
- I will miss You.

1185
01:19:21,483 --> 01:19:23,451
And I to you.

1186
01:19:23,485 --> 01:19:26,545
- ¿I can carry You al airport?
- Sure.

1187
01:19:26,689 --> 01:19:29,123
Along the way we pass for house
of Phillip to return you...

1188
01:19:29,124 --> 01:19:32,116
The shelter that you lost.

1189
01:19:40,602 --> 01:19:42,968
¡Go, this is fantastic!

1190
01:19:43,005 --> 01:19:44,973
Is marvelous.

1191
01:19:45,007 --> 01:19:48,847
We wait for that its mother
Dwells to live up.

1192
01:19:49,311 --> 01:19:52,431
- Beautiful feelings.
- Runs, runs, runs.

1193
01:19:56,518 --> 01:19:58,679

They are going to say something.

1224
01:22:10,052 --> 01:22:12,520
Tripp, I ask pardon.

1225
01:22:12,554 --> 01:22:15,546
My work was manipulator and deceitful.

1226
01:22:16,225 --> 01:22:20,725
But the second that knew it about
Amy, was going to finish with all.

1227
01:22:21,029 --> 01:22:24,021
But I did not be able, because informed you before.

1228
01:22:34,276 --> 01:22:37,268
I feel it.

1229
01:22:42,284 --> 01:22:44,411
I accept the excuses.

1235
01:22:59,268 --> 01:23:02,103

Support. And if already the group... exists

01:23:02,104 --> 01:23:05,206
I want to know if is a small group,
as a team of basketball...

1237
01:23:05,207 --> 01:23:08,199
Or one large... as the Chinese.

1238
01:23:09,945 --> 01:23:13,414
- Someone is in a bad mood.
- Your mother still did... you

1239
01:23:13,415 --> 01:23:15,406
Tortillas to have breakfast.

1240
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:20,070
And I did not enter your life because
I wanted. Your parents called me.

1241
01:23:20,355 --> 01:23:23,424
Your life was in a boss
It extended to postpone things.

1242
01:23:23,425 --> 01:23:27,161
- I Hope I could speak thus.
- It Is easy when they are hitched.

1243
01:23:27,162 --> 01:23:30,282
Not, I have spoken with
Men hitched before.

1244
01:23:32,868 --> 01:23:35,236
¿You want to speak of my life? And yours?

1245
01:23:35,237 --> 01:23:37,738
Perhaps it should not to judge. It owes
there to be a reason why...

1246
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:41,842
you became a chupadora of
Souls, murderer of dogs and harpy.

1247
01:23:41,843 --> 01:23:44,045
I do not understand. Do what has
That to see the dog in that?

1248
01:23:44,046 --> 01:23:46,747
- Good question.
- ¿You rise Him the volume?

1249
01:23:46,748 --> 01:23:49,740
They are the of the PC, so...

1250
01:23:51,186 --> 01:23:54,053
To be not that...

1251
01:23:54,089 --> 01:23:57,929
I was well before
Appearing. Entertained me.

1252
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,053
And I ruined it all.

1253
01:24:00,095 --> 01:24:03,297
¿Therefore you wanted to leave me?
Good, was not thus.

1254
01:24:03,298 --> 01:24:07,018
You presented me your parents
So that I left you.

1255
01:24:08,403 --> 01:24:10,803
- It Called its attention.
- ¡Thus is!

1256
01:24:10,839 --> 01:24:15,819

I feel it.

1258
01:24:19,815 --> 01:24:25,515
- ¿Why did you do it?
- Because you looked at me with The Look.

1259
01:24:27,356 --> 01:24:27,962
The Look not...

1260
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:29,657
¿Why has it to speak of The Look?

1261
01:24:29,658 --> 01:24:31,926
- ¿What look?
- The look that says...

1262
01:24:31,927 --> 01:24:34,919

1264
01:24:42,738 --> 01:24:45,502
Yes. Not.

¿But what I know about you? All the
time that were together...

1268
01:24:56,952 --> 01:24:59,921
Was a lie.

1269
01:25:00,222 --> 01:25:02,723
I found a woman to which to want...

1270
01:25:02,724 --> 01:25:05,716
And resulted to be a total fraud.

1271
01:25:08,497 --> 01:25:12,217
- ¿You Have real feelings?
- Of course that yes.

1272
01:25:12,901 --> 01:25:15,893

Because had a good life before.
