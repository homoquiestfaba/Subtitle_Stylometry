1
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:29,697
So, Daisy Bea.

2
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,733
Anything bothering you?

3
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:34,002
Out of the ordinary?

4
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,571
- Mm. Nope.
- Good.

5
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,373
-And how's Camille doing?
-Uh...

6
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:42,911
- She's Camille.
- Yeah.

7
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:46,213
We all just love her here.
A wonderful lady.

8
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,448
Now there's
a bit of pressure here.

9
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,721
Now, Daisy,
still no children, huh?

10
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,623
Not that I'm aware of.

11
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,492
Seriously, though, no kids.

12
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,828
Is that something that you're...

13
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,565
Well, is that something
that you're planning on?

14
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:05,800
Yeah. Absolutely.
One day. Always have.

15
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:08,335
Excited about kids.
I just don't want to rush it.

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,906
Now, Daisy, I don't want
to sound insensitive here,

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,307
but one day...

18
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:17,545
This is one of those
"Now or never" type situations.

19
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:18,947
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,615
-Now or never?
-Yeah.

21
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,051
I don't want to startle you
or anything, but...

22
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,721
...another year or so
and, well...

23
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:29,456
...it'll just get
harder and harder.

24
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:32,259
Now it says here that you're
still on birth control, right?

25
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,562
-Yeah.
-That's another hurdle.

26
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:37,899
You don't just have the age
working against you,
but the hormonal imbalance.

27
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:39,534
What's with all the age talk?

28
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,669
If your birthday
is correct here,

29
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,438
it says to me
that you're not thirty.

30
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,173
Well, I'm in my thirties.
So there's that.

31
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,742
Almost 40?

32
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,845
Right. No. Sure.
Yeah. I know that.

33
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:52,747
Okay, great.

34
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,816
Then we're on the same page.

35
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,018
Absolutely. Same page.

36
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,853
May want to get
that ball rolling.

37
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:28,716
-It's Friday already?
-The one day of the month

38
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,184
that they don't all have
their faces all shoved
in their phones.

39
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,888
- Rally! Rally!
- Hey, come on.

40
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:37,025
Come on, guys. This is a place
of study and focus.

41
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,793
No one cares.

42
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,898
Not to be the bearer
of bad news,
but no one cares about you.

43
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:45,533
That's not true. I do.

44
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:47,702
Aw. That's just too cute, Daisy.

45
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:48,803
Hey.

46
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,479
I'll give it back to you when
you learn to call me Miss Bea.

47
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:01,082
I'm a teacher
and you're a student.

48
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,150
Learn a bit of respect.

49
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,651
You're not a teacher.

50
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:06,921
You're a, whatever,
librarian, Miss Bea.

51
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,389
Can have it back now?

52
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,258
It'll be in the counselor's
office after school.

53
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,728
Come on, Sadie. Let's go.

54
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,868
So rude.

55
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:29,644
Oh, uh,
your <i>art du jour</i> project.

56
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,546
Oh, I always love these.

57
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,447
So what's the latest passion
in the class today?

58
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,750
We are rounding out
our scratch art projects.

59
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,351
Pretty much my favorite form.
It takes a steady hand.

60
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,320
Oh. Cool. You have fun.

61
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,872
So, how's everything
with Stephen?

62
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:01,008
-It's good.
-That sounds like
a dream relationship.

63
00:04:01,142 --> 00:04:03,477
Well, he keeps, you know,
laying down these little
"Let's take it slow"

64
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,713
-or "Let's go with the flow"
type jabs.
-You should break up with him.

65
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:09,517
-No, I can't. Just moved in.
-I'm kidding. Wow.

66
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,786
Not even a thought.
That's impressive.

67
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,022
Well, he loves horses, and, you
know, horses are my weakness.

68
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:19,326
-I think cruising along with
the status quo is your weakness.
-Ouch.

69
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,328
I'm just saying,
if you want different outputs,

70
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,497
you need to try
different inputs.

71
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,265
-You know what I'm saying?
-Mm.

72
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,868
Inputs?

73
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,470
You never want to settle down?

74
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,040
We're still so young, Daze.

75
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,442
Well, that's not what
I've been hearing lately.

76
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,845
All this talk
about settling down

77
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:42,083
comes from this generation
who graduated high school,

78
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:43,383
got married and...

79
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:45,119
oozed out children.

80
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,354
Your mother.
The world is different now.

81
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,924
Sure, but biology does not care
if the world is different.

82
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,761
Believe whatever you want
to believe, and I will be here
to support you.

83
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:55,797
You gotta teach?

84
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,098
Yep. I got jazz.

85
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:58,331
You should come sometime.

86
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,736
-I'll think about it.
-I love you.

87
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:02,770
I love you.

88
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:05,773
Hm.

89
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,690
Hey, do you need a hand?

90
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:25,358
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, awesome.

91
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:26,694
Oh!

92
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,877
Oh.

93
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,345
You're so lucky to get
to babysit this little prince.

94
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,315
Oh, no, he's mine.

95
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,616
Thanks so much.

96
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,693
Oh, sorry. Bye.

97
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:00,862
Bye.

98
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,075
- Hey, darling.
- Frank!

99
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:16,143
-Frank dear.
-How's the--

100
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,713
How's the library?
You need anything?

101
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,882
- No, it's great.
- Frank!

102
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:23,851
How's the office?

103
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,620
Mm. Stressful.

104
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,088
-Hence the beer.
-Mm.

105
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,891
I guess I have a husband
who's hard of hearing.

106
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:31,424
Camille. Hello, dear.

107
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,493
You staying for dinner, Daze?

108
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:35,763
She's going
to the cowboy's house.

109
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,397
That's where I live.

110
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,567
Sort of. A lot of stuff here.

111
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,068
So how is it over there, anyway?

112
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:43,704
How's Stephen?
I haven't seen him in ages.

113
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,806
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on that.

114
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,010
Oh, Daisy, don't make any plans
for tomorrow night.

115
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:53,247
-Why?
-There's a photography exhibit
for Jack Palmer.

116
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:54,548
Up and coming.

117
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:56,684
Everyone's raving about him.

118
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,886
We can socialize a bit,

119
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,323
rub some elbows,
get you a new job.

120
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:06,127
-She just said
that she loves her job.
-Yeah, I'm totally fine with it.

121
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,797
The amount of fine you are
with things really concerns me.

122
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,967
7:00 p.m.
Already got us tickets.

123
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,036
Fine.

124
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:17,838
Mm.

125
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:32,887
My parents invited you over
for dinner soon.

126
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,855
Your mom going
to be there?

127
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:37,158
Um, she counts as a parent. Yes.

128
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,760
Mm. Have to think about that.

129
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:41,494
What do you mean?

130
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,031
It's not that
she frightens me necessarily.

131
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:47,301
-It's just-- She terrifies me.
-What?

132
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:49,837
She's just always so nervous.
I think it's her eyes.

133
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:54,041
Maybe you could get used to it
'cause it could be
a very nice evening.

134
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:56,811
Come on, Daisy. It's not like
I don't want to be there.

135
00:07:58,346 --> 00:07:59,547
Sounds like it.

136
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:01,015
It's...

137
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,187
With my last girlfriend,
everything went so fast,
too fast.

138
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,889
Hmm. We've been
dating for a year.

139
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:11,559
I just don't want
to rush dinners.

140
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,928
Okay? I, I, I just want to go
with the flow.

141
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:16,496
Hey.

142
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,200
We've got a good thing going.

143
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:22,169
We do, don't we?

144
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:28,509
Okay. Same page?

145
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,913
-Mm.
-Do you want to maybe go,
you know...

146
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,688
How, how's that?

147
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,123
That's good.

148
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:45,659
Awesome.

149
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,763
Well, yeah.

150
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:54,268
- Hey, can we talk for a second?
- Yeah.

151
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,704
Sure. Now?

152
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,374
Um, never mind. Keep going.

153
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:02,810
-You sure?
-Yeah. Yeah. Keep going.

154
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,247
I feel like you're not sure.

155
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,681
I'm super sure.

156
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,026
Impressive.

157
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:20,428
Thanks.

158
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,063
Come on, August. Hurry up.

159
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:23,697
Hey, where y'all going?
The bell hasn't even rung yet.

160
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,599
We're trying to get
to third period early.

161
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,835
Miss Bonneville has
a big announcement to make.

162
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,604
-Ooh.
-We're hoping
it's a new French easel.

163
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,406
Hm.

164
00:09:35,443 --> 00:09:38,345
All right. Well,
you're all here.

165
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,649
May as well get this over with.

166
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:43,651
Get what over with?

167
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:47,455
I'm leaving you.

168
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,823
Wait.

169
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,859
- What?
- I'm so sorry,

170
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:55,229
but there has been
a blatant disregard

171
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,332
for what I've been trying
to build here
and I, I've had it.

172
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:00,367
I can't finish this semester.

173
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,005
Starting tomorrow,
this class will serve

174
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,809
as an open study
period supervised by...

175
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,244
I don't know who.

176
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:13,647
You said you had good news.

177
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,416
No, I said I had news.

178
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,884
You supplied the good part.

179
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,085
So no French easel?

180
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:21,222
French easel? No. No.

181
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:23,791
This is, like, our life.

182
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,160
There's just a handful of you.

183
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,262
No one has interest.

184
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,331
I'm exhausted.

185
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,767
I have been fighting
and fighting for years,

186
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,604
clawing to get more funding.

187
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,473
I've invested more time and
money than any teacher should.

188
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:44,078
I love you kids,
but it's too much for me now.

189
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:49,483
Surely there's a grant,
or donors or something.

190
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:51,118
Who are you?

191
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:52,486
I'm Daisy.

192
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:54,523
Librarian. Hi.

193
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,657
Oh, yeah, Daisy.

194
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,593
You go find them.

195
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,427
You go apply for them.

196
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:02,229
I'm finished.

197
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:04,665
This is bullshit.

198
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:22,683
Oh, it's like
an exponential crisis.

199
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,985
- Existential.
- Whatever.

200
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,820
Just go take your piss.

201
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:28,455
Gross.

202
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:30,791
Sadie, on your way.

203
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,132
Hey, guys, come on.
I know it's a big blow,

204
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,634
but it's not the end
of the world.

205
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,735
I thought you would
actually care.

206
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:43,003
I do care.

207
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:45,372
I'm just saying
it's going to work out.

208
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:49,710
It doesn't seem like it.

209
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,930
Isn't he brilliant?

210
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,832
He certainly loves nude women.

211
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,901
How do you reckon
she got into that position?

212
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,169
Trash compactor?

213
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:53,040
I certainly admire his gumption,
but he could at least

214
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,609
put some clothes on
at least a few of them.

215
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:57,144
Oh, but that would be
boring then, wouldn't it?

216
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,780
Yeah, I can't say
you're wrong there.

217
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:02,449
-Where are you going?
-Food.

218
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:04,084
You already have food.

219
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,387
That's my favorite piece.

220
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:10,659
Oh, shit. Um, what did you say?

221
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,494
The portrait
that you're looking at,

222
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:14,828
it's my favorite one.

223
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,363
So vulnerable.

224
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:19,601
I'm wondering
how that's vulnerable.

225
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:24,838
Well, you know,
to expose yourself in that way,

226
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,308
in that fashion,

227
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,443
find the animal within.

228
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:31,011
It's a woman in some mesh.

229
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:34,348
So you don't think
there's more to it than that?

230
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,718
The animal thing is interesting.

231
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:39,887
Maybe that's what
he wants us to think.

232
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,856
-He?
-The photographer dude.

233
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,093
Right. Yeah. Uh...

234
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,429
I had heard that, um...

235
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:51,131
Someone said she had to stay
in that position
for, like, over an hour.

236
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,635
Much to his dismay, I'm sure.

237
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:54,868
I don't follow.

238
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,303
Lots of naked chicks.

239
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,573
Well, come on. I mean, that's--

240
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:00,007
It's all for the art, I suppose.

241
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,711
-Right. The sacrifice.
-Exactly.

242
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:07,881
I should, uh, talk
to a few more guests,

243
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,450
but this was--

244
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:11,051
Well, I didn't...

245
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,153
-Oh, Daisy.
-Daisy.

246
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,422
-That's a nice name.
-Thanks.

247
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,025
Why do you have to go and...?

248
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,765
Shit. You're Jack Palmer?

249
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:27,968
Have a nice night, Daisy.

250
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:33,775
It looked like
he was flirting with you.

251
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,442
-We have to go.
-What? Why?

252
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:36,544
I just insulted him.

253
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:38,613
Oh, it didn't look like that
to me.

254
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:41,081
-It looked like flirting.
-I have a boyfriend.

255
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,350
Oh, I'll find out
if he's single.

256
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:45,754
I know I'm saying words,
and there's air
coming out of my mouth.

257
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,522
They just don't seem to land.

258
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,557
Great. Thanks.

259
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,365
Mm. Mm.

260
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,076
Mm.

261
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,479
Oh, handsome.

262
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,117
You all right?
Did I do something?

263
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:18,952
No. I'm okay.

264
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:21,756
Mm. Smell good.

265
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,257
Well, ain't it?

266
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,540
It's been a while
since we've, uh,

267
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:40,174
caught up since the move.

268
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:46,046
You know, you're right.
It has just been
"Go, go, go," hasn't it?

269
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,981
Well, that's putting it lightly.

270
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,686
What do you want to talk about?

271
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:55,055
Well, how's life?

272
00:15:55,924 --> 00:15:59,026
It's fun. It's, it's good
now that you're here.

273
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:02,797
That's about it, I guess.

274
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:04,031
Mm.

275
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:06,701
Cool.

276
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,738
Anything else on your mind?

277
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,074
Mm, no, not really.

278
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,047
Mm.

279
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:24,552
Okay? I'm just gonna splunk
right into it.

280
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:27,454
I went to the doctor's office
the other day and...

281
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:30,525
...he said, um, that

282
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:33,595
I don't have much time.

283
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:38,131
What are you telling me,
Daisy, are you dying?

284
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,468
No. Gynecologist.
No cancer or anything.

285
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:44,271
-Just egg stuff.
-Oh, well, thank God.

286
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,741
I mean, don't say eggs stuff,
but, I mean,

287
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,577
good for, you know,
not dying and all.

288
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:51,311
Yeah, uh, listen,

289
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:55,115
I'm about to be 40,
and so biology has a way of...

290
00:16:57,785 --> 00:16:59,486
-Oh.
-Yeah.

291
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,355
And he said that
if I wanted to have kids,

292
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,758
I really need to start
thinking about that, and...

293
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:07,027
I'm not saying "Hey,
let's make a baby right now."

294
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,128
I just...

295
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,798
-Not at all.
-Okay. Well, thank God.

296
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:15,369
Well, I just want to see
if that was something that...

297
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,105
...you know, you might...

298
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,310
Okay. Uh, I'll be honest.

299
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:26,814
Maybe, I don't know.
I'd want to be married first.

300
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:29,349
Um, and we agreed
to take it slow.

301
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,719
And I always liked the idea
of living with someone

302
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:35,389
for a little while before
I made that decision. So...

303
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:36,991
Yeah.

304
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,259
Okay. Yeah. No, sure.

305
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,035
You mad at me?

306
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,804
I mean, I've told you
my rationale from the get-go.

307
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,272
Yeah. And I told you mine.
I wanted kids one day.

308
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,876
-Wait a minute. That's not fair.
-No, this is my fault.

309
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:58,646
I should have talked about this
before my lease was up
and I just moved in.

310
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,782
I didn't know there was
gonna be such a hard deadline.

311
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:04,819
Gosh, time is such a bitch.

312
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:12,627
I didn't know that having kids
was that important to you.

313
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:14,696
Yeah.

314
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,170
Uh, I don't know what to say
right now, Daisy.

315
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,840
Back to square one.

316
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:27,341
Not necessarily. I--

317
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:28,943
Do you or don't you want kids?

318
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:31,111
Yes or no? No gray area, please.

319
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,220
Then you should've said
that from the beginning.

320
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:44,157
I'll stay with my parents.
Get my stuff out of here.

321
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,727
Wait, are, are we breaking up?

322
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,462
I don't see any reason
to waste any more time.

323
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:50,497
Well...

324
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:54,969
-Dang.
-Dang is not the perfect thing
to say right now, Stephen.

325
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,304
I know. I'm sorry. It's just...

326
00:19:01,643 --> 00:19:03,477
Suddenly, I'm not
all that hungry.

327
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:05,079
Me neither.

328
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,913
What do you think that's about?

329
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,309
Square one.

330
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:17,985
Miss Bea, are you okay?

331
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,286
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

332
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:21,856
You guys?

333
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:25,325
Besides hating life, you mean?

334
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,796
At least you have a purpose.

335
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,798
Not for the next hour.

336
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:32,767
Not for the next life.

337
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:46,379
Hey, where's my <i>art du jour</i> ?

338
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:08,002
Come in.

339
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,072
-Oh, hey, Daze.
-Hey.

340
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:13,340
I wanted to ask you
about Miss Bonneville leaving.

341
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:15,209
-I mean,
the kids had just gutted.
-Oh, yeah.

342
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:17,310
She shouldn't have
said all that.
Wasn't supposed to come out

343
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,547
till the end of semester,
and I was supposed
to make the announcement.

344
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,083
Can't you just give her
the resources she needs
to finish it out?

345
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:23,951
-That would at least
give us a little--
-You know I love you, Daze.

346
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:26,788
But this isn't some fancy
high school you pay tuition for.

347
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:29,023
Or one that pays for supplies.
We're public.

348
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:31,659
-Yeah.
-And public schools
are a business.

349
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:34,327
And in Louisiana,
investments are made

350
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,097
in programs with interest.

351
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:38,533
-Football.
-Football.

352
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,969
Sports. Hell, women's volleyball
is doing pretty well.

353
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,205
But aside from, what,

354
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,607
eight students
in the arts program,

355
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,109
I hate say it, but who cares?

356
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:49,911
-Dad!
-I'm sorry,

357
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:54,182
but when I weigh eight
versus 2,000 fans
in the stands on Friday,

358
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:57,985
-it's a no brainer.
-During World War II,
they asked Winston Churchill--

359
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,922
They asked him to cut funding
for the arts, and he said,

360
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:03,124
"But then what
would we be fighting for?"

361
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:05,526
I'm the one
who told you about that quote.

362
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,394
Well?

363
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:13,333
It's money. Relevance.

364
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,403
You know I'm a big supporter
of the arts, Daze,

365
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:20,641
but I also know where I stand as
principal of this institution,

366
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:22,342
which is, after all...

367
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:25,079
-A business.
-Exactly.

368
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:28,249
Is there anything else
I can do for you, hon?

369
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:31,319
I imagine you have other things
to worry about more than this.

370
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:34,121
No, I'm trying
not to think about it.

371
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:35,355
I don't know.

372
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:39,359
Well, maybe this, uh,

373
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:42,697
well, change in routine
will help with some perspective.

374
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:45,032
Maybe you're right.

375
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,500
See you tonight.

376
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:52,133
I said it already.

377
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,834
You know, I'm exhausted.

378
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:58,873
I mean, I, I, I can't even
get the most basic materials.

379
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:03,244
Brushes, good paper,
non-huffable glue, huh.

380
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:08,549
Coach Davis snaps his fingers
and pfft, your dad
comes crawling.

381
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:10,952
It's just not that simple,
Miss Bonneville.

382
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:13,621
You're a grown woman.
Call me Helen.

383
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:17,457
Okay, Helen, um,
the kids are devastated.

384
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:19,627
They will find their way.

385
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,562
I don't know that they will
without you.

386
00:24:21,696 --> 00:24:24,832
I mean, can't you just stay
until December?

387
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:29,203
I don't know. Run through
all the materials and supplies.

388
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:31,372
A grace period.

389
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:36,277
Uh, it's all so lifeless,
isn't it?

390
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,878
Politics. Money.

391
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:41,048
Who cares about getting
a well-rounded education, right?

392
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:46,020
You know, I think I've earned
the time to paint and write,

393
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:49,190
- and...
- who knows, maybe even act.

394
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,491
But the teaching no, no.

395
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:55,596
I've run out of energy for it.

396
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,169
You seem to really
care about them.

397
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:03,571
Why don't you help them?

398
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:05,539
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

399
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:08,109
You know what I tell
all my artists?

400
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:11,846
Get creative.

401
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:32,767
So, first you come to my show

402
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,069
-and you insult
my photography...
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

403
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,837
...and then you're just going
to show up out of nowhere,

404
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:38,806
-and you're going
to ask me for help?
-Yep.

405
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:41,375
See? I like that. That's bold.

406
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:44,011
-Wow. That is
a beautiful picture.
-Hmm.

407
00:25:44,145 --> 00:25:46,781
- Look at that.
They're so cute.
- Yeah.

408
00:25:46,914 --> 00:25:49,116
Smiles are mesmerizing,
aren't they?

409
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,885
Captured it in Angola.

410
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:54,121
Think it kind of has
this glimmer of hope

411
00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:56,257
in a devastating time.

412
00:25:56,724 --> 00:25:58,225
Through family.

413
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:01,462
Well, didn't expect that
from you.

414
00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:03,464
Yeah, it's not all naked women.

415
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:06,967
Unfortunately, your story,

416
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:09,170
it's not all that unfamiliar
to me.

417
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:11,605
These arts programs,
they keep getting cut.

418
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:13,207
It's bit of a national trend.

419
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,142
-Hm.
-So what were you thinking?

420
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:17,678
Uh, keep in mind, too.
I'm a freelancer.

421
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:20,014
So, like, schedules,
not really my jam.

422
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:21,982
I totally get it. The class
meets three times a week,

423
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:24,018
only for an hour.
But right after lunch.

424
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:26,187
Eight kids?
What's your play on all this?

425
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,289
I think I'm really close
to two of them.

426
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:30,925
-You think?
-Yeah, it's hard to tell
with teenagers,

427
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:33,194
but it was the collective look
that "Armageddon is near"

428
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:35,362
on their faces
when the teacher quit, so...

429
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,100
-I guess you never know
what they could become.
-Exactly.

430
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:41,969
-Like, their effect
on the world.
-Yes.

431
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,105
Okay, uh, let's see.

432
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,575
Hmm. It's tough.

433
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:50,111
I'm saving up for this trip
to Haiti in January,

434
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:53,114
so I kind of have to hold on
to all the cash flow I can get.

435
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:56,417
Uh, plus, I got to be some
sort of fiscally responsible.

436
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:59,320
-I could pay if it helps.
-Oh, no, no, no, sorry,
that's, that's not what I meant.

437
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,856
-It's just like if, uh,
commission were to come up--
-It's done.

438
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:05,493
-We're paying you.
-Mm. They cut
the funding for the program.

439
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,928
I guarantee the school
is not going to cover the costs.

440
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:10,532
Don't worry about it.
It's handled. Got it.

441
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:14,268
-Okay. Uh, how?
-Would that do it?

442
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:17,671
I mean, I don't know
if I feel comfortable.

443
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:20,307
I mean, you get to help
some kids uncover
their creative selves

444
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:21,842
and get some money.

445
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:23,711
Would that do it?

446
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:28,482
Yeah.

447
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:32,153
Okay. See you Monday.
One o'clock.

448
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:34,288
Monday, one o'clock.

449
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:49,270
So, he volunteers one hour
every three days,

450
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:51,372
for the rest of the semester.
Then what?

451
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:53,542
I don't know.
I figured it's a great start.

452
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:56,410
It's a good start. I'm just
thinking long term here.

453
00:27:56,545 --> 00:27:58,445
-I don't have
a full-fledged plan yet.
-Daisy.

454
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,649
You're right. I haven't done
anything like this before, so--

455
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:02,149
-And I understand that--
-You know what?

456
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:03,652
I'll chew on it tonight
and I'll let you know.

457
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:05,786
- Daisy!
- Oh, my Lord, Mom. What?

458
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,689
You've been ignoring our guest.

459
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,597
Well... lovely meatloaf.

460
00:28:16,665 --> 00:28:18,667
I'm sorry, Bradley. I don't know
what my mother has told you,

461
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,536
-bless her heart--
-I know you didn't just say
bless her heart.

462
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,972
But she doesn't seem to care
that I just broke up
with my boyfriend last night.

463
00:28:25,105 --> 00:28:28,042
So I'm on hiatus while I try
to help some of my students.

464
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:30,044
-Not your students.
-My kids, then.

465
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:32,746
Nope. Don't have
any of those, either.

466
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,284
What's the...

467
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:39,554
...what's the long term plan
to keep the class?

468
00:28:39,954 --> 00:28:43,090
I'm willing to work
with you here, Daze,
but this is your show,

469
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:45,025
-and I'm just not going to--
-Show?

470
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:47,596
Yeah, your show. I'm a very
busy man. So I'm not--

471
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,029
I could put on an art show.

472
00:28:49,163 --> 00:28:50,864
A silent auction,
raise money that way.

473
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:52,701
Preposterous.

474
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,768
I'm sorry, Bradley.

475
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:58,038
Get real money for supplies.
Maybe create some more buzz.

476
00:28:58,172 --> 00:29:00,741
-Get more students interested.
-Okay. Okay.

477
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,545
Okay. Date, time?

478
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:05,479
I don't know. I just thought
of it like five seconds ago.

479
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:08,282
This is a big distraction,
if you ask me.

480
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:11,085
- We'll need all the time we can get.
-  -And rude.

481
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:13,722
December 13th, last Friday
before the end of semester.

482
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:16,790
Art show.

483
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,727
Just need a time.

484
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,595
I don't know. 7:00 p.m.?

485
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:22,162
7:00 p.m. it is.

486
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,298
Clock's ticking.

487
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,701
Don't expect my help
with any of this.

488
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:28,703
Don't worry, I'm not.

489
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,405
You should get back
to your guest.

490
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:37,545
Ouch.

491
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,818
This is really good meatloaf.

492
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:46,954
Oh, Bradley, stuff it!

493
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:07,107
Uh, Miss Bea...

494
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:09,810
...where's this Jack Palmer guy?

495
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:11,979
He'll be here.

496
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:14,248
He's probably just running late.

497
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:16,483
I hope so.

498
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:20,321
No disrespect, Miss Bea.

499
00:30:20,454 --> 00:30:23,223
But what if this guy
doesn't show up?

500
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:24,626
What do you know about art?

501
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:28,495
Um...

502
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:31,566
Let me check.

503
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:45,145
<i>Daisy!</i>

504
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:48,315
Eat.

505
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:50,518
I'm not that hungry anymore.

506
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:52,886
More for me.

507
00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:57,291
So it went well?

508
00:30:58,158 --> 00:31:00,361
It was rough.

509
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:04,898
But I'm going
to nail it on Wednesday.
Even if Jack doesn't show up.

510
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:06,867
Yeah, absolutely.

511
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:11,038
You know, I would start
by organizing this place.

512
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:14,041
It's got scatterbrain
written all over it.

513
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:17,579
Mm, yeah, well,
that's Bonneville.

514
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:24,451
We need a fresh start,
change things up.

515
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:25,919
Narrow the focus.

516
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:29,624
Well, let's get started,
shall we?

517
00:31:30,124 --> 00:31:31,593
-We?
-Yeah.

518
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:34,529
I want to bask
in your newfound excitement too.

519
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:35,830
Aw.

520
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:38,432
- Hey.
- Hey, Mr. Bea.

521
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:41,135
Pulling some after hours, huh?

522
00:31:41,268 --> 00:31:43,505
Yep. About to whip
this place into shape.

523
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:44,839
I see you've got food.

524
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:46,541
I'll let your mother know.

525
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:49,577
Dinner in the classroom.

526
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:51,445
after a first day,

527
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:53,914
the life of a true educator.

528
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,384
I'll see you at home.

529
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,317
Absolutely not.

530
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:33,688
Look, I've come to terms with
the fact that I'm getting older.

531
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:35,088
So there's a plan C.

532
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:36,724
You might just like it.

533
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:38,526
Donor insemination.

534
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:40,562
We get a jump start
on the process.

535
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:42,229
I might need your help
raising the child

536
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:44,599
if Mr. Right
doesn't come along first.

537
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:48,168
Doesn't have to be A-B-C.

538
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,739
Maybe it's ACB.

539
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:54,809
That's not the proper way.

540
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:57,745
I just got off
birth control, Mom.

541
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,213
I'm trying here.

542
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:03,350
I saw them in the trash.
Why the change of heart?

543
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:05,954
Does it really matter to you?

544
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:09,122
How much?

545
00:33:36,784 --> 00:33:38,620
Is tomorrow still looking rough?

546
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:44,926
These kids need you.
I have no clue what I'm doing.

547
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:47,695
I mean, you could give me
a paintbrush and I'd try
to eat rice with it.

548
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,797
Here.

549
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,200
Oh, God.

550
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:56,538
And I may have promised
my dad that we're putting on

551
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:58,740
an art show in December.
So there's that.

552
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:00,307
I'm sorry. What?

553
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,544
A silent auction,
you know, to sell the kids' work

554
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:04,278
to rai-- raise money
for the program. I mean,

555
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:06,213
I told him that you and I
would put it together.

556
00:34:07,414 --> 00:34:10,384
Do you always speak
for other people
or is that sort of a new thing?

557
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:12,286
It's a new thing.

558
00:34:13,153 --> 00:34:14,321
Mm.

559
00:34:14,856 --> 00:34:16,189
Cool.

560
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,495
Okay, the hard walkout thing,
it's not gonna work every time.

561
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:39,246
-That's what you got.
-I told you.

562
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:40,949
I was hoping for
an after-school shopping trip.

563
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,817
Um, I have a little budget
for that.

564
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:45,485
Oh.

565
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:49,924
Whoa, Miss Bea!

566
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:52,292
Love what you did
with the place!

567
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,829
Yeah. It looks like
someone actually cares.

568
00:35:10,078 --> 00:35:11,913
Uh...

569
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:13,413
Uh, okay.

570
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:17,885
Well, we are getting started
a little bit behind,

571
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:19,587
but that's good.

572
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:21,856
I always find
that the creative mind

573
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,891
thrives with an uphill battle.

574
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:28,362
You throw your inhibitions away
and you just-- you go with it.

575
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:32,366
Some people are going to say
that that's winging it, but...

576
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,401
...I say organic.

577
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,304
Now, do we have
limited supplies?

578
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:39,574
Yeah.

579
00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:41,542
Yeah, that's putting it lightly.

580
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,511
But...

581
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:46,179
...you don't need
a high-end studio

582
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:48,516
to create something
that's visceral.

583
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:55,657
We will get more supplies

584
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:59,326
to create a one-of-a-kind show.

585
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:01,161
But until then...

586
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,665
...this is your centerpiece.

587
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:09,369
This is what the entire exhibit
is going to revolve around.

588
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:11,304
What piece?

589
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:16,044
With those supplies,

590
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:18,412
and this trash...

591
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:23,216
...and the time we have
between now and the exhibit.

592
00:36:23,785 --> 00:36:26,654
Tell me something,
but with a sculpture,

593
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:29,791
All right, guys,
let's get to work.

594
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:33,961
Uh, what do you want it to say
with the sculpture?

595
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:38,733
We're not done yet.

596
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:45,439
When we snap a photo,

597
00:36:45,573 --> 00:36:48,442
we are looking for the way
the light falls. Sure.

598
00:36:48,576 --> 00:36:50,444
Composition. All of that.

599
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:55,750
But most importantly, we are
looking for a moment in time.

600
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:59,087
<i>That look on someone's face,</i>
<i>right?</i>

601
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,889
Something you couldn't
manufacture even if you try.

602
00:37:09,997 --> 00:37:12,100
Such a good start
for everybody today.

603
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,901
Really. Just so good.

604
00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:19,140
And scoop, scoop.

605
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:20,808
Open, open.

606
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:22,009
Very good. Keep going.

607
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:23,611
Keep going. Eyes up, boys.

608
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:26,313
Yep. We're shooting this
within a week.

609
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:27,682
-Hey.
-How's it going?

610
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:30,518
-I feel good.
-No, with the kids.

611
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:33,353
Oh, yeah, they're cool.

612
00:37:33,955 --> 00:37:36,758
I could really use some with
a little less self-awareness.

613
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:39,527
Chad, buddy, loosen it up
a little bit.

614
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,565
Oh, we have to get back
to the studio, so...

615
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,667
-All right.
-It's nice to see you.

616
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:48,102
-Yeah.
-Thanks for having us.

617
00:37:48,236 --> 00:37:49,904
Yeah. Bye, Jack.

618
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:54,742
I know. I know.

619
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:56,144
Okay, bye.

620
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:59,981
All right. Let's just do this
all again, shall we?

621
00:38:30,244 --> 00:38:31,813
I was jealous.

622
00:38:31,946 --> 00:38:34,982
Well... Oh, I haven't eaten
anything all day.

623
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:37,350
Would you want
to go grab something?

624
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:38,318
Absolutely.

625
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:39,754
-Okay.
-Yes.

626
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:43,991
That's all you.

627
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,393
Well, not actually, come on.

628
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:49,297
-You gotta save some of
that for me.
-Look, those are three berries.

629
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,731
-I'm getting one.
-All right.

630
00:38:50,865 --> 00:38:51,833
Right.

631
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:53,701
So...

632
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:57,672
Mm. Been a while since I've
shared dessert with someone.

633
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:59,273
Yeah?

634
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:00,440
I haven't been on a date...

635
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:03,511
...in a long time.

636
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:06,681
Well, who says
this is a date, mister?

637
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:11,652
Oh, no...

638
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:14,055
- Sorry.
- I'm kidding.

639
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:16,791
Oh.

640
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:21,529
I have to ask you a question
that kind of
puts me in the gallows.

641
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:22,697
But...

642
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:27,068
...you know, uh, about
that check that I gave you.

643
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:29,270
-Oh.
-I was just wondering
when you were going to--

644
00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:31,038
or if you have deposited it.

645
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:32,974
You're talking about this check?

646
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:35,610
Yeah. Great.

647
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,378
So, uh, do you know
when you're going to...?

648
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:39,847
Yeah.

649
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,352
Wait. What are you doing?

650
00:39:44,484 --> 00:39:45,653
I don't want it.

651
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:49,023
What do you mean
you don't want it?

652
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:50,124
I don't want it.

653
00:39:53,194 --> 00:39:56,063
- Well, isn't that the whole
reason why you showed up?

654
00:39:56,197 --> 00:39:57,331
Okay. All right.

655
00:39:57,464 --> 00:39:59,901
Yeah. Well, fine.

656
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:03,037
I feel like a jerk about that.

657
00:40:05,373 --> 00:40:06,908
Well, you're forgiven.

658
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:09,677
Thank you.

659
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:12,580
And...

660
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:16,517
...I see why you went to bat
for these kids.

661
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:19,153
They are pretty great, huh?

662
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:20,688
Yep.

663
00:40:22,823 --> 00:40:24,859
It makes you think, though.

664
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:27,929
About what?

665
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:30,831
Like...

666
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:34,568
...if I had a kid, right?

667
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:37,838
Like some, you know,
just a toddler running around,

668
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:40,875
wreaking havoc all over
the place. Or, or if you did.

669
00:40:41,642 --> 00:40:44,745
-Go on.
-Well, how difficult...

670
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:49,016
...that would make what
we're doing for these kids.

671
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:51,786
But, uh...

672
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,989
...now, you know,
we're able to help

673
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:56,791
eight of them.

674
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:00,528
So, yeah, I mean...

675
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:04,832
Thank you.

676
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:09,570
Cheers.

677
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:13,741
To the kids.

678
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:16,577
To the kids.

679
00:41:17,845 --> 00:41:19,547
Also to this cheesecake.

680
00:41:19,947 --> 00:41:21,983
-Hey.
-I told you I'm not gonna share.

681
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,598
You do it yet?

682
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,134
Mom?

683
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:44,605
How long
have you been standing there?

684
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:48,542
No.

685
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,246
They recommend that you wait
at least a month
so you're off birth control.

686
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,948
Even if I didn't know
that was bullshit--

687
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:56,050
-Whoa!
-I'd say it has been a month.

688
00:41:57,585 --> 00:41:59,687
Uh, well, time flies, huh?

689
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,623
Do I really need to say
clock's ticking again?

690
00:42:02,757 --> 00:42:04,392
You're single. Fine.

691
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:07,028
But what about
your ACB proposal?

692
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:10,765
And you're wasting your time
with that ludicrous art project.

693
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:13,401
I called all
the insemination clinics.

694
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:15,770
No inquiries on your behalf.

695
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:17,071
That's frightening.

696
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:19,173
Your focus is not
in the right place.

697
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:22,777
You're acting like you're
living in the glory days again,

698
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,212
Well, maybe 39 is my glory days.

699
00:42:25,346 --> 00:42:28,182
Plus, if it makes
you feel any better,

700
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:31,285
I went on a date last night
with Jack, and I was happy.

701
00:42:31,419 --> 00:42:32,386
Jack Palmer?

702
00:42:32,521 --> 00:42:35,389
He's a tomcat, a, a, a player.

703
00:42:35,524 --> 00:42:36,924
Everyone knows this.

704
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:38,893
You seemed all about it
at his art show.

705
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:41,429
According to my bridge club,
he gets around.

706
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:42,863
Your bridge club?

707
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:45,733
You're wasting your time.

708
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:49,703
You said you wanted a child.
Remember?

709
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:51,272
Someone to nurture.

710
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:52,573
I was 16.

711
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:55,042
Then you were 24
and then you were 30.

712
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:57,645
Well, maybe I'm not
as with that anymore.

713
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:59,680
With that?

714
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:01,550
You're lying to yourself.

715
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:04,919
-This must be a phase.
-What if it's not?

716
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:07,955
Well, then,
I want my money back.

717
00:43:08,956 --> 00:43:11,826
No, You know what?
You keep it. It'll help you.

718
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:14,762
-With what?
-Moving cost.

719
00:43:14,895 --> 00:43:18,165
Rent. Some place else.

720
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:51,232
Eden!

721
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:53,734
- Mm.
- Coffee!

722
00:43:53,868 --> 00:43:56,137
Mm. Fine.

723
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:05,779
I think I need to talk
to Jack about the kid thing.

724
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:08,550
Daisy, it is way too early
for this.

725
00:44:08,682 --> 00:44:09,817
Fine. Eat a bagel.

726
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,685
You eat a bagel.

727
00:44:15,356 --> 00:44:16,457
Fine, sure.

728
00:44:16,591 --> 00:44:18,659
I waited a whole year
to talk to Stephen

729
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:20,828
about this and look
where it got me.

730
00:44:21,262 --> 00:44:25,299
It opened the opportunity for
you to meet Jack, who is fun.

731
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:27,168
And creative.

732
00:44:27,636 --> 00:44:29,538
-And...
-Sexy.

733
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,871
Sexy.

734
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:33,974
And you just had
your first date last night.

735
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:37,311
If you go through this
and that guy
doesn't run for the hills,

736
00:44:37,444 --> 00:44:39,313
I will completely question
that guy's sanity.

737
00:44:39,446 --> 00:44:40,781
I just need to know
if it's something

738
00:44:40,915 --> 00:44:43,450
that he wants,
you know, someday.

739
00:44:44,718 --> 00:44:45,886
There's no harm in that.

740
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:47,622
Okay.

741
00:44:48,055 --> 00:44:51,025
I say this as someone
who loves and trusts

742
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:54,161
and is consistently
confused by you,

743
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:55,362
it's a bad idea.

744
00:44:55,496 --> 00:44:56,697
But Jack's different.

745
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,166
I mean, he's kind
and understanding,

746
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,268
and he's in tune with himself.

747
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:06,941
And I feel like time
is running out for me.

748
00:45:08,075 --> 00:45:10,444
I have this literal feeling.

749
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:13,814
Okay, I'm going to create
an app that goes

750
00:45:13,948 --> 00:45:15,249
straight to your brain
that warns me

751
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:16,850
of your next thought
and why you're having it.

752
00:45:16,984 --> 00:45:19,353
Like the weather app,
but Daisy's brain.

753
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:23,525
-I'm gonna ask him.
-You have selective hearing,
you know that?

754
00:45:23,658 --> 00:45:25,492
Thank you for talking me
through this.
It was very helpful.

755
00:45:26,026 --> 00:45:27,761
Selective hearing.

756
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:29,330
Bye.

757
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:46,514
Psst. Hey.

758
00:45:46,648 --> 00:45:47,616
Daisy?

759
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:49,350
-Lunchtime yet.
-Hmm.

760
00:45:49,883 --> 00:45:52,853
- Uh, about four minutes.
- Oh. Mm.

761
00:45:55,422 --> 00:46:00,461
So I think a guy like you would
want full disclosure. Yeah?

762
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:02,963
Oh. A guy like me?

763
00:46:04,566 --> 00:46:07,334
I'm potentially about to ruin
something great.

764
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:09,870
How so?

765
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,640
Simply by talking.

766
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:14,808
Never knew a civil conversation
could do that.

767
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:21,516
Look, Daze, if it makes you feel
any better about
whatever's on your mind,

768
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,851
you know, I am an artist, sure,

769
00:46:23,984 --> 00:46:26,387
but I'm rational, you know?

770
00:46:27,054 --> 00:46:28,355
I do listen.

771
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:29,990
Just spit.

772
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:32,459
Well, my ex-boyfriend,

773
00:46:32,594 --> 00:46:34,962
about a day before I came
waltzing into your studio--

774
00:46:35,095 --> 00:46:37,031
Oh, no. Jealousy issues?

775
00:46:37,164 --> 00:46:38,733
-Stalker?
-No.

776
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:42,704
We actually separated after
being together for about a year.

777
00:46:42,836 --> 00:46:45,105
Oh, so it was serious.

778
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,508
-Well, I thought so.
-Mm-hmm.

779
00:46:46,641 --> 00:46:49,877
And we had the discussion
about having kids,

780
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:53,881
and we decided to just end it.

781
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,152
Well,

782
00:46:58,753 --> 00:46:59,754
that is a...

783
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:03,157
That's a big relief. I'm really
relieved to hear that.

784
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:05,859
Wait.

785
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:07,127
Why?

786
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:10,831
Well, um...

787
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:15,069
Okay. So based
on our conversation
from the other night...

788
00:47:16,303 --> 00:47:19,073
Whoa. All right. I just figured
I would get it off my chest.

789
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:21,942
I had a vasectomy,

790
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:25,879
like, two years ago. So...

791
00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:30,050
I mean, it's good
to be on the same page,

792
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:32,886
assuming things
were to move forward,

793
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,557
which hoping they do...

794
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:43,097
Oh.

795
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:47,468
Oh, you were the one
who wanted kids.

796
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,205
What made you think otherwise?

797
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:57,512
We cheers-ed our coffees.

798
00:47:58,379 --> 00:48:01,215
We talked about helping
a lot of kids.

799
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:05,486
Sorry, I just-- I was completely
under the impression--

800
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,055
So you never want kids
since we're assuming things
from our date?

801
00:48:08,188 --> 00:48:09,456
Okay. Can we slow down? Right?

802
00:48:09,591 --> 00:48:11,892
'Cause this is happening
really fast.

803
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:13,561
-Well?
-No.

804
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:18,098
Then no.

805
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:21,536
I like my life how it is.

806
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:27,207
And who would be stupid enough
to bring a kid
into this world anyway?

807
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:29,343
So I'm stupid for wanting kids?

808
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:33,447
No, I-- No,
I didn't mean that. I just...

809
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:38,485
Daisy. I mean, we just had
our first date,
and it was an impromptu one.

810
00:48:38,986 --> 00:48:40,254
Where is this coming from?

811
00:48:40,722 --> 00:48:43,490
It's coming from the fact
that I don't have time...

812
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:46,493
...to figure out
what the hell it is that I want.

813
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,364
I'd love to be with you
for a year.

814
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:51,398
But then...

815
00:48:52,534 --> 00:48:54,034
...if I brought this up then...

816
00:48:57,906 --> 00:49:00,207
Dream world, it's you

817
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:01,709
and a kid.

818
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:17,224
You got a very
unorthodox sense of timing.

819
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,597
We're old. We should be honest
with each other by now.

820
00:49:24,866 --> 00:49:26,133
We're not that old.

821
00:49:36,977 --> 00:49:40,915
I'm really sorry about
any misunderstanding, and I...

822
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:43,952
I completely understand
where you're coming from.

823
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:46,554
Stop being so nice.
You're making it worse.

824
00:49:46,688 --> 00:49:48,523
Just rational.

825
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:53,393
-Business as usual.
-Of course.

826
00:49:56,029 --> 00:50:00,000
Hey, Mr. P, I got an idea
for my third piece.
I'm going to change it up a bit.

827
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:01,936
Cool. Oh, yeah, yeah.

828
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:03,403
Hey, can't wait to see that.

829
00:50:03,938 --> 00:50:06,875
Is that sandwich spicy,
Miss Bea? You're tearing up.

830
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:09,109
Super spicy.

831
00:50:13,982 --> 00:50:15,683
-Hey.
-Hey.

832
00:50:16,551 --> 00:50:18,553
Hey, guys.

833
00:50:21,723 --> 00:50:23,123
-Hey.
-Hey.

834
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:25,259
Shit.

835
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:29,931
-You have to go?
-I promise,
I, I didn't plan it like this,

836
00:50:30,063 --> 00:50:32,132
but... yeah.

837
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:34,401
-Okay. Go.
-I'm really sorry.

838
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,137
I'm sorry.

839
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:51,653
Um, Sadie, excuse me.

840
00:50:51,786 --> 00:50:52,954
What are you doing?

841
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:55,757
So I just got transferred
to this class

842
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:58,626
because, well, home ec sucks.

843
00:51:01,963 --> 00:51:03,330
Can I come inside?

844
00:51:04,966 --> 00:51:06,400
Uh...

845
00:51:09,704 --> 00:51:10,672
Cool.

846
00:51:12,439 --> 00:51:13,908
There has to be something
you can do, Dad.

847
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:15,075
Don't call me that here.

848
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,444
Oh, because it's such a secret.

849
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:18,947
Let me be Frank.

850
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:20,748
Sorry.

851
00:51:21,816 --> 00:51:24,819
This is kind of funny
because my name is Frank.

852
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:26,486
I know, Dad.

853
00:51:27,689 --> 00:51:28,723
Sorry.

854
00:51:28,856 --> 00:51:30,190
My hands are tied, Daze.

855
00:51:30,324 --> 00:51:32,994
-She's a bully.
-No, she's a student.

856
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:34,629
She tortures August and Maddie.

857
00:51:34,762 --> 00:51:36,798
Well, then, it's your duty
as a teacher

858
00:51:36,931 --> 00:51:39,399
to mold her into
a compassionate human being.

859
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:42,670
-Me?
-Yes, you, Jack,
whoever else is helping.

860
00:51:42,804 --> 00:51:44,672
Jack had to step out
for the day.

861
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:48,009
Then, quick question.

862
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:50,712
-Yeah.
-Who's watching your kids?

863
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:54,916
Oh. Oh, uh...

864
00:51:57,384 --> 00:51:58,886
You're not an artist.
You're an idiot.

865
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,221
Say that to my 5,000 followers.

866
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,357
Hi, all. I'm--

867
00:52:04,993 --> 00:52:07,929
-Excuse me?
-Go hike up your skirt
for another five likes.

868
00:52:08,062 --> 00:52:11,465
-Maddie.
-I mean, I would,
but Daisy's got my phone.

869
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,534
Good. Maybe you can
use your brain for once.

870
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:16,403
Okay, everybody just stop!
Go back to your projects.

871
00:52:19,507 --> 00:52:20,775
Well, what about me?

872
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:26,781
What about you, Sadie?

873
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:37,058
Lord, please bless this food
to the nourishment of our body.

874
00:52:37,224 --> 00:52:38,593
Please watch over Mom,

875
00:52:38,726 --> 00:52:40,460
or please help
Daddy find his teeth.

876
00:52:40,595 --> 00:52:41,562
Amen.

877
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:45,933
So, um...

878
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:48,636
...your mom tells me
you're trying to get pregnant.

879
00:52:50,605 --> 00:52:53,240
- Oh, Lordy! Are you okay?
- Stanley, you goof.

880
00:52:53,373 --> 00:52:55,009
Sorry. Sit. Don't get up.

881
00:52:55,143 --> 00:52:56,878
- Oh.
- I'm fine.

882
00:52:57,011 --> 00:53:00,782
- I'm sorry.
I, I, I didn't mean--
- Stanley, stop it.

883
00:53:01,214 --> 00:53:03,751
If only most men
were so forthcoming.

884
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:05,787
Mom, you're laying it on
a little thick.

885
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,922
You told me to set this up.

886
00:53:10,024 --> 00:53:11,626
So, Stanley, quick question.

887
00:53:12,026 --> 00:53:14,729
Is there an office poll
for when I'll get knocked up?

888
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,532
Well...

889
00:53:23,004 --> 00:53:25,707
- Is she this
crazy at work?

890
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:28,876
Uh, sometimes. Yeah.

891
00:53:30,343 --> 00:53:31,779
I'm sorry she dragged you
into this.

892
00:53:31,913 --> 00:53:34,816
No, I got a good roast
out of it.

893
00:53:35,983 --> 00:53:37,451
I'm not good
at this kind of stuff.

894
00:53:37,585 --> 00:53:40,188
So I'm sorry
if I acted a fool in there.

895
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,023
No, no, not at all.

896
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:43,758
It's just, like,
you're real nice

897
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:47,394
and, and pretty funny
and all, and...

898
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:51,431
Yeah, I might not be the right
guy for you, but it's just...

899
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:55,335
- I, I know I'm direct--
- That's great.

900
00:53:56,671 --> 00:53:57,638
Yeah?

901
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,509
It's just-- You know,
I don't want to be 70

902
00:54:01,642 --> 00:54:03,745
when my kid
graduates high school.

903
00:54:04,277 --> 00:54:06,681
Um, could, could
I call you sometime?

904
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:09,016
Yeah.

905
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,990
Let's take it slow.
We don't have to jump in bed
right this minute.

906
00:54:16,124 --> 00:54:19,727
Yeah. I wouldn't know
what to do if we did.

907
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:22,663
I'm kidding.

908
00:54:23,197 --> 00:54:25,867
I've totally had
intercourse before.

909
00:54:41,682 --> 00:54:42,683
Hey.

910
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:47,688
I know today was kind of
a weird one, but, uh...

911
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:51,559
-...can we straighten
a couple things out?
-Sure.

912
00:54:52,392 --> 00:54:53,561
Okay.

913
00:54:55,029 --> 00:54:55,997
You and me,

914
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:59,734
we do not always see
eye to eye on everything.

915
00:55:00,268 --> 00:55:02,970
But I think that we had,

916
00:55:03,104 --> 00:55:07,008
or have, a real connection.

917
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,077
- It's effortless and--
- Hey, Daisy!

918
00:55:12,547 --> 00:55:13,981
Late lunch for milady.

919
00:55:14,115 --> 00:55:16,449
-Oh, thank you.
-Mm.

920
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:20,621
Uh, yeah. I'm sorry.
I should be going.

921
00:55:21,088 --> 00:55:22,489
Wait. Are you sure?

922
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:24,692
Yeah.

923
00:55:25,092 --> 00:55:28,596
Well, don't forget
we have that meeting
at the venue after school.

924
00:55:28,729 --> 00:55:32,567
So I will, in fact,
see you later.

925
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:33,968
Great.

926
00:55:38,272 --> 00:55:39,574
-Uh, you're a lifesaver.
-Mm.

927
00:55:39,707 --> 00:55:41,609
Yeah. What's, uh, what's this?

928
00:55:42,043 --> 00:55:43,911
No idea.

929
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:05,365
So...

930
00:56:06,267 --> 00:56:09,469
...I will need a deposit on the
space no later than the seventh.

931
00:56:09,604 --> 00:56:12,907
It's a popular spot
for Christmas parties.

932
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,443
You all are able to load
in the dock out back
the night before.

933
00:56:16,577 --> 00:56:18,546
However, I will need
everything out

934
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,681
by 8:00 a.m.
the next morning. Right?

935
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:22,884
I will give you all a minute.

936
00:56:29,657 --> 00:56:31,559
So what's with the photograph?

937
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,895
You seemed to like it.

938
00:56:34,528 --> 00:56:36,530
I did. Thanks.

939
00:56:37,365 --> 00:56:39,100
Then you like my dream.

940
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:47,675
Sorry. Uh, Hannah,
can we just get, like,
a quick moment alone?

941
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:53,413
Sure. Uh, my daughter will be
here at seven and then I...

942
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:54,982
We'll need to leave.

943
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:02,957
It was right after Angola,

944
00:57:03,524 --> 00:57:04,692
the vasectomy.

945
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,794
Hm.

946
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:09,530
If I had a kid of my own,

947
00:57:09,664 --> 00:57:12,533
I know that I would love
that kid so damn much

948
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:15,770
that I wouldn't be able
to focus on anything else
except parenting.

949
00:57:15,903 --> 00:57:18,506
Oh, I see a whirlwind.

950
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:19,840
Maybe you could do both.

951
00:57:20,408 --> 00:57:22,910
I want to help
thousands of kids over my life.

952
00:57:23,577 --> 00:57:25,947
I know that's not
traditional, but...

953
00:57:26,881 --> 00:57:28,481
...if I could give
that many children

954
00:57:28,616 --> 00:57:31,451
just, like, a sliver
of joy, of hope.

955
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:33,621
Well, then, that's my dream.

956
00:57:34,722 --> 00:57:36,524
And I meant what
I told you in the library.

957
00:57:36,657 --> 00:57:39,060
I see something
really special with you.

958
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:44,198
Look, I don't want to be
unfair to your dream.

959
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,103
It's just, for now,
it's too difficult.

960
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:52,073
Being around you,
knowing all of this...

961
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,209
...that I'm special to you,
it's just...

962
00:57:58,913 --> 00:58:02,083
Okay, so, what do we do?

963
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:04,719
You've done so much
for these kids already,

964
00:58:04,852 --> 00:58:07,688
so you can just go help
the next ones.

965
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,391
Well-- No, what do you mean?

966
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:12,827
No, I'm going
to follow through on this.

967
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,763
Plus, you have no idea how
to put on a show by yourself.

968
00:58:16,697 --> 00:58:18,165
Maybe that's good.

969
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:20,634
Maybe I'll bring a new
perspective to the art scene.

970
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:25,139
Keep an eye out
for the invite. Okay?

971
00:58:25,573 --> 00:58:27,975
I'd love to see you here.
Sincerely.

972
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:31,479
I know how I'm coming off.

973
00:58:31,612 --> 00:58:33,881
It's just what I need right now.

974
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:38,886
You got a real knack
for ending things, huh?

975
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:57,071
Mom, I'm here.

976
00:59:10,117 --> 00:59:11,585
Jack is our ace
in the hole, Miss Bea.

977
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:13,187
How are we going to do this
without him?

978
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,722
Everyone just calm down!

979
00:59:14,855 --> 00:59:16,457
Yeah. I mean, we worked
our tails off for this,

980
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,858
and he just cuts and runs?

981
00:59:17,992 --> 00:59:19,528
It's not like that.
It's not on him.

982
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,694
It's on me. Okay?

983
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:24,131
And why exactly is it
on you, Miss Bea?

984
00:59:27,268 --> 00:59:28,035
What?

985
00:59:44,118 --> 00:59:45,586
Thanks for sitting here with me.

986
00:59:45,953 --> 00:59:47,455
Silence is really nice.

987
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:49,256
A lot of noise
in my life lately.

988
00:59:49,824 --> 00:59:52,561
-Mm.
-You know
you're killing it, right?

989
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:55,262
Thanks.
You're really kind.

990
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:58,299
I saw your dance video.
It's so good.

991
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:00,701
-Really?
-Yeah. Yeah. Ah.

992
01:00:00,835 --> 01:00:02,503
Oh.

993
01:00:02,636 --> 01:00:03,938
Our venue.

994
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:06,807
- Hey, Miss George, what's up?
<i>- Daisy.</i>

995
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:09,076
Hi. Look, I just wanted
to give you a quick call

996
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:11,378
to let you know that the
gallery, it was already booked

997
01:00:11,513 --> 01:00:15,449
<i>-on the day</i>
<i>that you had reserved it.</i>
-I, I'm sorry. What?

998
01:00:15,584 --> 01:00:18,686
Yeah. Unfortunately,
it's just not going to work out
the way we hoped.

999
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:20,589
Oh, no, no, no.
You can't do this right now.

1000
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:24,291
No, no. Don't you worry your
pretty little head about it.

1001
01:00:24,425 --> 01:00:27,094
I will have
that deposit back to you ASAP.

1002
01:00:27,228 --> 01:00:30,898
I don't want my deposit back.
I want the space for the show,
like we discussed.

1003
01:00:31,265 --> 01:00:33,334
I mean, the kids, they're
really depending on this.

1004
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:35,035
I am sorry.

1005
01:00:35,402 --> 01:00:36,804
That is just not possible.

1006
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:39,574
Well, what about
some other date?

1007
01:00:39,707 --> 01:00:40,941
Like, anything other--

1008
01:00:41,075 --> 01:00:42,810
You know, I've got
another call buzzing in,

1009
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:45,813
but I'm so glad
that we could work this out.

1010
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:47,248
Work what out?

1011
01:00:47,381 --> 01:00:50,050
Thank you so much
for understanding. Namaste.

1012
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:05,166
Hm. That little brat.

1013
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:06,767
What happened?

1014
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:17,344
Yeah. Hi.
I was wondering if you have
any availability in December?

1015
01:01:17,478 --> 01:01:19,880
The entire month is full?

1016
01:01:20,649 --> 01:01:21,583
Wow.

1017
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:24,985
No, there won't be
any open flames.

1018
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,321
Alcohol? No, it's a kids' show.

1019
01:01:28,088 --> 01:01:29,423
That's just the insurance cost?
That's--

1020
01:01:29,558 --> 01:01:31,258
A little over our budget.

1021
01:01:31,392 --> 01:01:32,426
Never mind.

1022
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:37,264
Uh-huh.

1023
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:40,569
Are you actually laughing at me?

1024
01:01:41,735 --> 01:01:44,738
It's a high school art show,
and our other venue bailed, so--

1025
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:45,806
No, I...

1026
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,642
Please? There has to be.

1027
01:01:47,775 --> 01:01:49,310
They're kids!

1028
01:01:49,443 --> 01:01:51,712
And goodbye to you too!

1029
01:01:58,485 --> 01:01:59,987
Any luck?

1030
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,889
No.
Everyone's either blocked or--

1031
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:03,424
Way too expensive?

1032
01:02:03,558 --> 01:02:05,259
Yeah, same here.

1033
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:07,629
We'll figure it out, Daze.

1034
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,699
Yeah, Thanks so much
for your help.

1035
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:16,437
Oh.

1036
01:02:17,572 --> 01:02:20,140
Miss Bea, uh, you all right?

1037
01:02:20,274 --> 01:02:24,579
Yeah, I'm fine. I, I just hit
a tiny little bump in the road.

1038
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:26,313
what happened?

1039
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:28,882
Well, we lost our venue.

1040
01:02:29,016 --> 01:02:30,384
It's double-booked.

1041
01:02:30,518 --> 01:02:32,853
What? That venue
was our ace in the hole.

1042
01:02:32,987 --> 01:02:34,888
You said that Jack
was your ace in the hole.

1043
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:37,358
Yeah, well, I thought
we lived in a world

1044
01:02:37,491 --> 01:02:40,361
- where there could be two aces
in one hole.

1045
01:02:40,995 --> 01:02:42,530
What are we gonna do now?

1046
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:46,166
Uh, well,
we'll keep calling places.

1047
01:02:46,701 --> 01:02:47,602
Ask around.

1048
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:49,436
You sure that'll work?

1049
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,438
Yeah, of course.

1050
01:03:10,057 --> 01:03:12,860
- I learned today that teaching
nine kids is pure hell.

1051
01:03:12,993 --> 01:03:16,196
-You're living the dream
compared to other teachers.
-Mm.

1052
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:19,099
You could only have
to worry about one.

1053
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:20,535
Just saying.

1054
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:25,573
Remind me, Mom,
where do you stand on the whole
me-getting-pregnant thing?

1055
01:03:25,707 --> 01:03:26,840
I forgot.

1056
01:03:29,143 --> 01:03:30,811
You miss the library full-time?

1057
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:32,913
I do a little. It was simple.

1058
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:35,482
Life is good when it's simple.

1059
01:03:36,016 --> 01:03:37,451
Took me a while to learn that.

1060
01:04:16,658 --> 01:04:19,561
Okay. Consider this
a trial run, Stanley.

1061
01:04:19,694 --> 01:04:21,261
Just to gauge. Okay?

1062
01:04:21,796 --> 01:04:23,297
Just some checkpoint questions.

1063
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,265
Do you drink?

1064
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,468
Uh, not much, no, uh...

1065
01:04:27,901 --> 01:04:30,437
Occasional shot of Boone's Farm
to take the edge off.

1066
01:04:30,572 --> 01:04:32,172
And how's your count?

1067
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,575
Huh?

1068
01:04:34,509 --> 01:04:35,543
Sperm?

1069
01:04:35,677 --> 01:04:37,010
Oh, uh...

1070
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,280
It's all there, I think.

1071
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:42,483
And do you secretly smoke?

1072
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:44,418
Never once.

1073
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:45,553
Hm.

1074
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:51,860
Oh. Uh...

1075
01:04:57,064 --> 01:04:58,265
What?

1076
01:04:59,868 --> 01:05:01,235
Nothing.

1077
01:05:02,336 --> 01:05:03,270
What?

1078
01:05:05,472 --> 01:05:07,207
I've never done
this before, Daisy.

1079
01:05:08,108 --> 01:05:11,078
Wait. Really?
I, I thought you said you had.

1080
01:05:17,184 --> 01:05:19,386
Well, are you okay?

1081
01:05:19,987 --> 01:05:22,289
Oh, it's-- Well,
you know, when you said

1082
01:05:22,423 --> 01:05:24,158
you didn't want to hop into bed
this instant,

1083
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:27,060
I, I, I just didn't think
it'd be this soon. But--

1084
01:05:27,194 --> 01:05:28,696
-We can wait.
-No.

1085
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:33,434
Let's do this thing.

1086
01:05:33,868 --> 01:05:35,068
Okay.

1087
01:05:40,474 --> 01:05:42,644
Okay. Wh-- What do I do next?

1088
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,414
Phew!

1089
01:05:48,982 --> 01:05:51,118
Well, goodnight, Stanley.

1090
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:52,620
Goodnight, Daisy.

1091
01:05:54,054 --> 01:05:55,355
Thank you.

1092
01:05:57,191 --> 01:06:00,394
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1093
01:06:01,896 --> 01:06:04,965
Oh, my God!

1094
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:07,869
That felt great.

1095
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:12,973
-Don't look at me like that.
-Like what?

1096
01:06:13,106 --> 01:06:14,341
He's nice.

1097
01:06:14,776 --> 01:06:17,745
- Yeah.
-  -Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

1098
01:06:17,879 --> 01:06:20,949
I miss when you were just
a librarian. I can't keep up.

1099
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:23,585
-Me neither.
-Just think.

1100
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:26,386
He'll remember last night
for the rest of his life.

1101
01:06:27,087 --> 01:06:28,790
Which is halfway over.

1102
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,428
Maybe you just needed to do this

1103
01:06:34,562 --> 01:06:37,498
so you could realize
that you really want Jack.

1104
01:06:38,265 --> 01:06:40,200
Yeah, maybe.

1105
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:41,803
Yeah. Let's just hope

1106
01:06:41,936 --> 01:06:45,105
old Stanley boy didn't get you
preggers in the meantime.

1107
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:50,512
Oh, my God, I was just kidding.

1108
01:06:52,112 --> 01:06:53,715
You used protection, right?

1109
01:06:54,481 --> 01:06:56,416
Listen, I, I think
I need a favor.

1110
01:06:56,551 --> 01:06:59,019
I, I forgot. I have
a doctor's appointment today.

1111
01:06:59,152 --> 01:07:00,487
Okay.

1112
01:07:01,756 --> 01:07:04,759
I need you to go to school
and be with the kids
right after lunch.

1113
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,896
And keep th-- keep thinking
of venues we can call,

1114
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:09,296
you know, for the show.

1115
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:13,066
What? Daze?

1116
01:07:47,267 --> 01:07:48,803
Just breathe, Miss Bea.

1117
01:07:49,202 --> 01:07:51,104
We'll get you sorted out. Okay?

1118
01:07:58,312 --> 01:08:00,113
Okay. Yeah. Come in.

1119
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:03,483
Hi. Are you Daisy?

1120
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:07,622
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. Upadhya.

1121
01:08:07,755 --> 01:08:09,824
Thanks for coming
to see me today.

1122
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:11,391
Okay, look, if I have cancer,

1123
01:08:11,526 --> 01:08:13,728
just rip the band aid off
and tell it to me straight.

1124
01:08:14,494 --> 01:08:15,395
You don't have cancer.

1125
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:17,130
I knew it.

1126
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:19,166
No, you don't have cancer.

1127
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,303
Oh, good. Thank God.

1128
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:25,238
I did look at your lab results.

1129
01:08:25,372 --> 01:08:26,674
Your urine analysis was normal.

1130
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:29,209
Your pregnancy test
was negative.

1131
01:08:29,343 --> 01:08:30,745
On your pelvic ultrasound,
though,

1132
01:08:30,878 --> 01:08:33,948
you did have uterine fibroids
and ovarian cysts.

1133
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,483
Given that you came in
in so much pain,

1134
01:08:36,618 --> 01:08:38,452
we can't rule out endometriosis.

1135
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,922
Good thing I know
what all that is.

1136
01:08:41,055 --> 01:08:44,324
It's a fairly common condition,
and until we know for sure,

1137
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:45,693
I can manage it
with some pain meds

1138
01:08:45,827 --> 01:08:47,461
which we can send
to your pharmacy.

1139
01:08:48,096 --> 01:08:50,163
But the thing I wanted
to talk to you about was,

1140
01:08:50,297 --> 01:08:51,766
I noted in your history,

1141
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:54,134
you've never
been pregnant before?

1142
01:08:55,803 --> 01:08:56,704
Okay.

1143
01:08:57,437 --> 01:09:00,675
Um, is that something
that you're interested in

1144
01:09:00,808 --> 01:09:02,342
or concerned about?

1145
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:03,845
Yes.

1146
01:09:04,646 --> 01:09:06,413
Wait. Yes.

1147
01:09:06,981 --> 01:09:08,181
Will I be able to?

1148
01:09:08,716 --> 01:09:10,518
I honestly can't tell you
for sure right now.

1149
01:09:10,652 --> 01:09:12,520
I'd have to refer you
to a specialist.

1150
01:09:12,654 --> 01:09:14,555
The way
they diagnose endometriosis

1151
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:16,724
is through
a laparoscopic surgery.

1152
01:09:16,858 --> 01:09:19,192
But if you're interested
in knowing your fertility,

1153
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:20,995
we can work that up
in a number of ways.

1154
01:09:21,129 --> 01:09:23,263
Oh.

1155
01:09:23,397 --> 01:09:25,767
This is a lot.

1156
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,738
I know. Um, to be blunt
with you, Daisy,

1157
01:09:30,872 --> 01:09:32,674
given your advanced
maternal age,

1158
01:09:32,807 --> 01:09:34,709
the odds aren't exactly
in your favor.

1159
01:09:35,777 --> 01:09:36,711
For what?

1160
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:39,047
So you're almost forty.

1161
01:09:39,914 --> 01:09:43,651
A man, he can have a baby
when he's 30, 40, 80.

1162
01:09:43,785 --> 01:09:47,155
- Right.
- Women, we're screwed.

1163
01:09:47,287 --> 01:09:48,690
Once we hit 35,

1164
01:09:48,823 --> 01:09:51,559
we're what's known
as an elderly primigravida.

1165
01:09:51,693 --> 01:09:54,494
-Elderly?
-I know. It's gross.

1166
01:09:54,862 --> 01:09:57,497
But basically,
it means once we hit that age,

1167
01:09:57,632 --> 01:09:59,867
the odds of having
a viable pregnancy

1168
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:01,201
drop significantly.

1169
01:10:01,636 --> 01:10:02,937
So it's not impossible,

1170
01:10:03,071 --> 01:10:05,873
but we really need
to gauge your priorities.

1171
01:10:09,409 --> 01:10:11,079
I have so many questions.

1172
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:12,714
Okay, take your time.

1173
01:10:13,614 --> 01:10:16,450
If I have endometriosis,

1174
01:10:16,984 --> 01:10:18,251
what are my options?

1175
01:10:18,853 --> 01:10:21,923
If it's a mild case,
they often recommend
a surveillance approach.

1176
01:10:22,422 --> 01:10:25,258
Everything you say sounds
like <i>Star Trek</i> to me.

1177
01:10:25,392 --> 01:10:27,227
Okay. I'm sorry.

1178
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,263
Basically, it means watch,
wait and see.

1179
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:31,632
If it's a moderate case,

1180
01:10:31,766 --> 01:10:33,835
they recommend
endometrial ablation

1181
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:35,435
or hormone injections.

1182
01:10:36,269 --> 01:10:40,508
If it's a severe case, it often
requires a hysterectomy.

1183
01:10:41,642 --> 01:10:43,778
I don't want to scare you,
but I really think

1184
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:46,981
we should prepare ourselves for
the worst case scenario here.

1185
01:10:48,448 --> 01:10:50,417
- <i>You're ruining</i>
<i>the class</i>

1186
01:10:50,551 --> 01:10:51,719
for all of us.

1187
01:10:51,853 --> 01:10:53,788
Okay, okay.
Everybody, calm down.

1188
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:57,125
-Calm down?
-It's Sadie's stupid fault
we don't have a venue

1189
01:10:57,257 --> 01:10:58,860
because she went
whining to Mommy.

1190
01:10:58,993 --> 01:11:00,595
- We don't know that.
- Yes, we do.

1191
01:11:00,728 --> 01:11:02,697
We called the venue like
we were potential customers.

1192
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:05,833
There's nothing booked on those
days. It was completely free.

1193
01:11:05,967 --> 01:11:07,969
And then we realized,
"Oh, it's her mom."

1194
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:11,539
Well, that's actually
pretty good detective work.

1195
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:21,516
-You bitch!
-What? You're going to cry now?

1196
01:11:21,649 --> 01:11:24,018
-Okay, stop it.
-You ruined everything, Sadie.

1197
01:11:24,152 --> 01:11:26,419
- What the hell do you have against us?
-  -Hey!

1198
01:11:27,054 --> 01:11:28,790
What's with all the noise?

1199
01:11:29,223 --> 01:11:31,659
Everything stops this instant.

1200
01:11:35,696 --> 01:11:38,166
I don't think I can do
the show anywhere, Mr. Bea.

1201
01:11:38,633 --> 01:11:41,068
What? Daze, what's wrong?

1202
01:11:41,202 --> 01:11:42,335
How did the doctor go?

1203
01:11:42,469 --> 01:11:43,971
Are you kidding, Miss Bea?

1204
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:45,940
You're our third
ace in the hole.

1205
01:11:46,574 --> 01:11:48,341
You really need to find
a different metaphor.

1206
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:49,944
Until further notice, I'm out.

1207
01:11:50,077 --> 01:11:51,612
Eden, you take care
of everything.

1208
01:11:51,746 --> 01:11:53,247
Dad, you do it, or--

1209
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,850
Kids, I don't care.

1210
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:59,020
Miss Bea,
you can't give up on us.

1211
01:11:59,386 --> 01:12:00,755
I know that
it's been stressful--

1212
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:02,990
-If she wants to go, let her go.
-Shut up, Sadie.

1213
01:12:03,124 --> 01:12:06,426
Okay, look,
it's been a long day, okay?

1214
01:12:06,561 --> 01:12:08,229
Just go home. Get some rest.

1215
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:12,432
You were the only one
that made this fun, Miss Bea.

1216
01:12:13,234 --> 01:12:14,401
Please?

1217
01:12:23,476 --> 01:12:25,478
Whoever did that to her work...

1218
01:12:26,747 --> 01:12:28,115
...you're better than that.

1219
01:12:44,565 --> 01:12:45,733
Daze.

1220
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,171
Daze, Daze.

1221
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:51,939
Hold up a second.

1222
01:12:54,508 --> 01:12:55,442
Listen...

1223
01:12:56,277 --> 01:12:58,378
...I know you're going
through a lot right now,

1224
01:12:58,512 --> 01:13:00,314
I mean, with, with the kids,

1225
01:13:00,447 --> 01:13:02,650
uh, your mother, the, the show.

1226
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:05,253
But, well, listen,
you can't just say,

1227
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:06,687
"Hey, Eden, cover for me."

1228
01:13:06,821 --> 01:13:08,556
I mean, she's not
a registered sub.

1229
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:10,224
I can get in some
serious trouble, you know?

1230
01:13:10,358 --> 01:13:12,260
I know, I'm sorry. It's just...

1231
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,129
-We lost our venue and--
-W-- Wait, Wait.

1232
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,931
-What? When did this happen?
-It doesn't matter.

1233
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:18,766
I've called everywhere.
Everything's booked.

1234
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,068
Okay. Okay.

1235
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:25,339
Well-- So what?
I mean, you don't have to have
some fancy gallery, Daze.

1236
01:13:25,472 --> 01:13:26,974
I'm sure we'll find something.

1237
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:30,111
It's art.
I mean, hell, you could hang it

1238
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:31,712
from the trees
in the Garden District

1239
01:13:31,846 --> 01:13:34,015
or, or burn it
in a bonfire at Dubai.

1240
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:36,284
-You could be very avant-garde.
-Dad.

1241
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:38,451
All right. What about Jack?

1242
01:13:38,586 --> 01:13:40,054
-We could use his studio.
-No, Dad.

1243
01:13:40,187 --> 01:13:43,391
Whatever. Just don't let this
be an excuse to quit.

1244
01:13:43,858 --> 01:13:46,093
All right? Those kids
are counting on you.

1245
01:13:47,395 --> 01:13:49,030
So let's buck up,

1246
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:51,666
figure this thing out
and finish what you started.

1247
01:13:51,799 --> 01:13:54,535
Dad, it's not just that.

1248
01:13:56,604 --> 01:13:57,939
Kiddo, what?

1249
01:13:59,707 --> 01:14:01,474
What-- Oh.

1250
01:14:17,091 --> 01:14:19,560
You should've
seen her today, Cammie.

1251
01:14:20,027 --> 01:14:22,229
She just seemed so defeated.

1252
01:14:26,267 --> 01:14:28,536
Well, she can
still freeze her eggs.

1253
01:14:28,669 --> 01:14:30,237
All is not lost.

1254
01:14:30,905 --> 01:14:32,707
You're not going to bring
that up again now, are you?

1255
01:14:33,473 --> 01:14:34,875
I'm just saying.

1256
01:14:37,745 --> 01:14:39,580
Let me give you
a little information.

1257
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:44,986
Your daughter is doing
a fantastic job with those kids,

1258
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:48,488
and I can't recall the last time
I've, I've seen her so excited

1259
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:50,658
or lively about anything.

1260
01:14:51,425 --> 01:14:52,693
She's been happy.

1261
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:56,130
Hell, the only time
I see her stressed or anxious

1262
01:14:56,564 --> 01:14:57,832
is when you're hounding her.

1263
01:14:58,566 --> 01:15:02,303
I mean, shouldn't, shouldn't
it be your goal as a mother

1264
01:15:02,737 --> 01:15:04,638
to see your daughter happy?

1265
01:15:08,442 --> 01:15:10,111
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

1266
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:12,513
I'm going to support her.

1267
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:16,417
Because our daughter
is doing something great.

1268
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:19,553
And I couldn't be
more proud of her.

1269
01:15:28,863 --> 01:15:31,132
<i>Hey, you've reached Jack.</i>
<i>Sorry I missed you.</i>

1270
01:15:31,265 --> 01:15:33,601
<i>You can leave me a message,</i>
<i>and I'll call you back.</i>

1271
01:15:33,734 --> 01:15:36,570
Hey, Jack. Hi. It's Daisy. Um...

1272
01:15:37,004 --> 01:15:39,006
I know it's been a minute,
but I had something

1273
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,908
I really need
to talk to you about.

1274
01:15:41,308 --> 01:15:42,309
Give me a call.

1275
01:15:43,344 --> 01:15:44,879
Uh, I hope you're well.

1276
01:16:02,531 --> 01:16:03,731
Okay.

1277
01:16:04,799 --> 01:16:07,301
We can do this. Yeah.

1278
01:16:11,906 --> 01:16:14,208
Oh, Jack. Hey, I'm,
I'm at the school right now,

1279
01:16:14,341 --> 01:16:16,710
but is there any way
that we could meet up
in, like, 30 minutes?

1280
01:16:16,844 --> 01:16:18,579
I have this huge favor
I need to a--

1281
01:16:20,614 --> 01:16:21,782
What?

1282
01:16:25,086 --> 01:16:26,053
What?

1283
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:33,594
This is...

1284
01:16:34,228 --> 01:16:35,029
Oh, my gosh, Jack.

1285
01:16:35,162 --> 01:16:36,565
Pretty wild, huh?

1286
01:16:37,031 --> 01:16:39,467
-You are so lucky to be here.
-I know. I know.

1287
01:16:43,204 --> 01:16:44,138
You know, Jack...

1288
01:16:44,872 --> 01:16:47,141
...you have a real
unorthodox sense of timing.

1289
01:16:51,378 --> 01:16:52,581
Why didn't you call me?

1290
01:16:53,214 --> 01:16:55,216
They're taking
good care of me here.

1291
01:16:56,383 --> 01:16:58,052
And, you know,
with your show coming up,

1292
01:16:58,185 --> 01:17:00,087
-I don't want to bother you.
-Hey, no.

1293
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:01,922
Our show?

1294
01:17:02,723 --> 01:17:04,992
Yeah, but...

1295
01:17:07,862 --> 01:17:10,965
Look, Jack, I'm so sorry
about everything.

1296
01:17:11,098 --> 01:17:13,602
I know I've been
all over the place. And--

1297
01:17:13,734 --> 01:17:15,069
Daze, you doing okay?

1298
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:19,273
No, no. Don't worry about me.

1299
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:20,941
I do though.

1300
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:25,880
I can't help but worry
about you, like, all the time.

1301
01:17:28,215 --> 01:17:29,183
Daisy...

1302
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:32,219
...just talk to me.

1303
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:39,226
I don't think
kids are happening.

1304
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:45,099
But you getting
in the crash and...

1305
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:49,336
...being here now
looking like this...

1306
01:17:50,137 --> 01:17:52,173
...maybe it's a sign
or something.

1307
01:17:53,542 --> 01:17:54,842
I don't know.

1308
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:58,613
-Now you are talking crazy.
-Ah.

1309
01:17:58,746 --> 01:18:00,181
Maybe I am, but...

1310
01:18:00,981 --> 01:18:03,417
...I got two pieces
of horrible news today.

1311
01:18:05,052 --> 01:18:07,354
And the thought of losing you
was the worst one.

1312
01:18:09,624 --> 01:18:10,791
You know?

1313
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,893
Does that make sense?

1314
01:18:14,862 --> 01:18:15,829
Well...

1315
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:20,768
- ...I'm happy that my pain
can be a sign for you.

1316
01:18:21,468 --> 01:18:23,904
Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry.
I just realized
how that came off.

1317
01:18:24,038 --> 01:18:25,773
-I'm not--
-I'm kidding.

1318
01:18:27,975 --> 01:18:29,476
So what happens next?

1319
01:18:30,077 --> 01:18:31,879
Do you...

1320
01:18:32,012 --> 01:18:34,348
Wow, Jack, you look like shit.

1321
01:18:35,517 --> 01:18:36,717
Hey, language!

1322
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,052
Sorry.

1323
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,255
Are you okay?

1324
01:18:42,657 --> 01:18:45,426
I mean, your wounds kind of
suit you.

1325
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,161
Oh, they do, huh?

1326
01:18:47,596 --> 01:18:49,698
Well, I mean, it's,
It's kind of badass.

1327
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:51,232
Yes, I am fine.

1328
01:18:51,365 --> 01:18:53,668
Guys, thank you.
Thank you for all these gifts.

1329
01:18:53,801 --> 01:18:58,806
Yeah, uh, gift shop had, like,
the most basic options. So...

1330
01:18:59,674 --> 01:19:00,774
Yeah.

1331
01:19:03,077 --> 01:19:04,912
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

1332
01:19:05,045 --> 01:19:06,413
Absolutely.

1333
01:19:07,181 --> 01:19:09,684
So... how are you feeling?

1334
01:19:09,817 --> 01:19:12,419
The show's right around
the corner. Tell me everything.

1335
01:19:12,554 --> 01:19:13,787
You guys ready?

1336
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:19,561
- What, did I say something?
- Well...

1337
01:19:20,461 --> 01:19:23,030
...we might have had,
like, a little, tiny hiccup.

1338
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:24,633
We had a catastrophic hiccup.

1339
01:19:24,765 --> 01:19:26,267
We lost our venue.

1340
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:27,702
What?

1341
01:19:28,235 --> 01:19:31,338
-How? Wait. What happened?
-Well...

1342
01:19:32,106 --> 01:19:34,408
-...it's complicated.
-It's my fault.

1343
01:19:36,877 --> 01:19:38,379
I'm sorry.

1344
01:19:39,213 --> 01:19:41,081
And the venue's
actually booked now.

1345
01:19:41,215 --> 01:19:43,450
I begged my mom, but there was
nothing she could do.

1346
01:19:44,785 --> 01:19:47,421
So why do you try
to sabotage us?

1347
01:19:47,988 --> 01:19:49,023
I don't know.

1348
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,492
At first, I thought
it was a funny joke,

1349
01:19:51,626 --> 01:19:55,162
but then I was standing
in the room full of people
who hated me.

1350
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:58,432
Whatever. Here.

1351
01:20:01,703 --> 01:20:04,572
-The gift shop had
the most basic options.
-Right?

1352
01:20:08,909 --> 01:20:10,811
Mm. I'm sorry, guys.

1353
01:20:11,278 --> 01:20:14,181
All is lost then...

1354
01:20:14,315 --> 01:20:17,217
Nothing's going to be available
on such short notice.

1355
01:20:17,719 --> 01:20:19,820
I'm sorry. You did your best.

1356
01:20:21,021 --> 01:20:24,091
Or you could use my place.

1357
01:20:25,426 --> 01:20:27,227
-Are you sure?
-Am I sure?

1358
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:29,830
-Yeah. Are you kidding?
-Oh, my God.

1359
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:31,899
I told you Jack
was our ace in the hole.

1360
01:20:33,702 --> 01:20:36,470
Oh, we're back on, huh?
Pretty close.

1361
01:20:36,604 --> 01:20:37,706
We're on.

1362
01:20:38,839 --> 01:20:43,143
I'm going to go to school,
do a, a big e-mail blast,
uh, print some flyers.

1363
01:20:43,745 --> 01:20:44,912
I'm so proud of you.

1364
01:20:51,151 --> 01:20:52,754
I don't expect you to help. I--

1365
01:20:52,886 --> 01:20:54,556
Let's talk hors d'oeuvres.

1366
01:20:54,689 --> 01:20:57,726
The bridge club gals are
ready to do the cooking.

1367
01:20:57,858 --> 01:21:00,160
So, is this a good time?

1368
01:21:25,152 --> 01:21:27,421
One HD projector for milady.

1369
01:21:27,555 --> 01:21:30,324
- Thank you, Stanley.
You are a lifesaver.

1370
01:21:32,926 --> 01:21:35,963
Yeah. So I, I can come over
and help you set it up.

1371
01:21:36,096 --> 01:21:38,633
Oh, that's okay.
August is, like, a whiz
of this kind of stuff,

1372
01:21:38,767 --> 01:21:40,234
-so...
-All right.

1373
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:43,103
Oh, and one more thing.

1374
01:21:43,237 --> 01:21:45,139
About the other night, I
just want to let you know that,

1375
01:21:45,272 --> 01:21:48,075
-you know, I'm going through
a lot of stuff--
-Let me stop you right there.

1376
01:21:48,877 --> 01:21:50,678
You have nothing to worry about.

1377
01:21:50,812 --> 01:21:53,347
I'm a reformed man.

1378
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,314
You sure?

1379
01:21:54,448 --> 01:21:55,449
Crystal.

1380
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:56,785
Clear.

1381
01:21:57,418 --> 01:21:59,554
-What?
-See you at the show tonight.

1382
01:21:59,687 --> 01:22:02,923
Okay, I wouldn't miss it
for a software convention.

1383
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:06,528
Good luck!

1384
01:22:23,645 --> 01:22:26,781
Bend. Nice. Go round.

1385
01:22:26,915 --> 01:22:28,716
Very nice, Sadie. And reach.

1386
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:31,619
<i>Reach, reach, reach, reach...</i>

1387
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,577
<i>Hey, all! Come out</i>
<i>to the art show tonight.</i>

1388
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:58,479
We've been working really hard,
and we're just dying to see you.

1389
01:22:59,714 --> 01:23:00,682
Right, August?

1390
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:03,150
We are dying. Yes.

1391
01:23:23,738 --> 01:23:26,106
Every single one of you
should be proud.

1392
01:23:27,509 --> 01:23:28,475
We did it.

1393
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:30,377
Your work is so beautiful.

1394
01:23:31,144 --> 01:23:32,614
I'm so proud of you,

1395
01:23:33,046 --> 01:23:34,248
and I don't care
what happens tonight.

1396
01:23:34,381 --> 01:23:36,016
If we sell one painting...

1397
01:23:36,885 --> 01:23:38,352
I just want you to be proud.

1398
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,456
Just be proud, okay?

1399
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:45,158
All right, let's mingle.

1400
01:24:26,433 --> 01:24:28,703
Well, look who got creative.

1401
01:24:28,836 --> 01:24:30,939
-Helen!
-Hi.

1402
01:24:31,071 --> 01:24:34,509
-Oh, my gosh.
-Hoping to raise enough money
to convince you to come back.

1403
01:24:34,642 --> 01:24:36,076
Oh, no, my dear.

1404
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:37,979
I could never do this.

1405
01:24:38,111 --> 01:24:39,212
This is you.

1406
01:24:39,346 --> 01:24:40,882
You and your team.

1407
01:24:41,315 --> 01:24:43,785
Your passion.
Your purpose, Daisy.

1408
01:24:44,184 --> 01:24:45,385
I'm just an old crone.

1409
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,154
Oh, stop!

1410
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:51,025
Miss Bonneville!
- Hi! Hey!

1411
01:24:51,158 --> 01:24:53,561
-We have to show you our stuff.
-Oh, I'd love to see it.

1412
01:24:53,695 --> 01:24:56,196
-Thank you for coming.
-Well done to you.

1413
01:25:03,638 --> 01:25:07,075
Daisy, what a turnout!
I can't believe this. Look.

1414
01:25:07,609 --> 01:25:10,143
Those are the principals
from some of the Magnet Schools.

1415
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:12,914
-Oh, that's amazing.
-You did that.

1416
01:25:13,447 --> 01:25:16,450
-You did that.
-Aw.

1417
01:25:29,463 --> 01:25:30,865
It's so, uh...

1418
01:25:32,033 --> 01:25:33,568
...poetic.

1419
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:35,770
I choreographed it.

1420
01:25:35,903 --> 01:25:37,672
Oh, did you now?

1421
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:40,041
Of course.

1422
01:25:40,173 --> 01:25:41,743
Yeah, you did.

1423
01:25:42,944 --> 01:25:44,078
-Mm.
-Hey, guys.

1424
01:25:44,211 --> 01:25:45,445
Oh, hey, Daisy.

1425
01:25:46,246 --> 01:25:47,949
We're having a great time.
This is awesome.

1426
01:25:48,082 --> 01:25:49,851
Cool.

1427
01:25:57,025 --> 01:25:59,627
- You looked so good.
- Oh, thank you.

1428
01:26:08,636 --> 01:26:10,138
He looks like trouble.

1429
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:11,806
You want me to get rid of him?

1430
01:26:12,807 --> 01:26:14,174
Look at you.

1431
01:26:17,477 --> 01:26:19,479
Ouch. Yeah.

1432
01:26:19,614 --> 01:26:21,181
You saved us. Thank you.

1433
01:26:21,314 --> 01:26:23,651
Daisy, I gave you a key.

1434
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:27,287
Hey, Miss Bea,
I think we should do it.

1435
01:26:27,421 --> 01:26:29,857
Yeah, like, right now.

1436
01:26:29,991 --> 01:26:31,926
You ready?

1437
01:26:33,528 --> 01:26:34,929
We're not done yet.

1438
01:26:35,063 --> 01:26:36,097
Bring it on.

1439
01:26:38,966 --> 01:26:40,467
Everybody, quiet down.

1440
01:26:40,601 --> 01:26:42,870
Thank you. Come this way.

1441
01:26:46,339 --> 01:26:50,178
I want to thank you all
for coming out for the inaugural
West High School Art gala

1442
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:52,180
hosted by none other
than Jack Palmer.

1443
01:26:59,187 --> 01:27:01,823
The students' final piece
is called <i>We're not done yet.</i>

1444
01:27:01,956 --> 01:27:04,525
It was created by
the entire art class as a unit,

1445
01:27:04,659 --> 01:27:06,994
cobbled together
from things forgotten.

1446
01:27:07,562 --> 01:27:08,730
We hope you get it.

1447
01:27:27,081 --> 01:27:30,350
With your support, we would love
to add more creative minds.

1448
01:27:30,484 --> 01:27:33,286
But even without it,
well, we'll find a way.

1449
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,690
So, uh, no pressure.

1450
01:27:36,557 --> 01:27:40,194
Wait, wait.
We need to thank our mentors.

1451
01:27:40,762 --> 01:27:43,831
Mr. Palmer, thank you
for letting us use your studio,

1452
01:27:43,965 --> 01:27:47,168
and of course, for
your knowledge behind the lens.

1453
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,704
Ah. Give me a bump. Phew.

1454
01:27:53,741 --> 01:27:57,145
And a big thanks to Miss Eden
for your free-flowing spirit.

1455
01:27:57,277 --> 01:27:59,346
Aw!

1456
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:00,782
Thank you.

1457
01:28:03,184 --> 01:28:05,686
But of course, of course,

1458
01:28:06,154 --> 01:28:09,791
-the biggest thanks of all
has to go to...
-Miss Bea.

1459
01:28:10,423 --> 01:28:12,226
Thank you for believing in us.

1460
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:14,162
And never giving up on us.

1461
01:28:14,327 --> 01:28:16,597
We don't know what
we would've done without you.

1462
01:28:17,098 --> 01:28:18,398
Thanks, guys.

1463
01:28:19,233 --> 01:28:21,569
Come on.

1464
01:28:45,626 --> 01:28:46,928
Oh!

1465
01:28:51,232 --> 01:28:52,567
-Drive safe.
-Of course.

1466
01:28:53,568 --> 01:28:55,870
And no texting.

1467
01:28:57,738 --> 01:28:59,339
Hey, Jack, are we still on
for tomorrow?

1468
01:28:59,472 --> 01:29:01,943
Yeah. Four o'clock.
Bring that Pentax.

1469
01:29:02,076 --> 01:29:03,376
Yeah.

1470
01:29:04,377 --> 01:29:05,847
Aw, thanks so much
for coming, guys.

1471
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:07,582
-It was fun, Miss Bea.
-Oh, good.

1472
01:29:07,715 --> 01:29:09,250
Yeah. Your new place is awesome.

1473
01:29:09,382 --> 01:29:10,518
Oh, thanks.

1474
01:29:12,286 --> 01:29:13,453
Bye.

1475
01:29:14,188 --> 01:29:15,957
Wow.

1476
01:29:16,456 --> 01:29:18,025
Stragglers, am I right?

1477
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:19,794
Come on.

1478
01:29:25,333 --> 01:29:26,433
Bye, guys.

1479
01:29:27,434 --> 01:29:28,836
-Happy birthday!
-Bye.

1480
01:29:31,806 --> 01:29:33,674
-Do you want to sit?
-Oh, sure.

1481
01:29:33,808 --> 01:29:34,876
Yeah.

1482
01:29:35,309 --> 01:29:37,410
Careful.

1483
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:39,881
Feeling okay? You need anything?

1484
01:29:40,014 --> 01:29:41,048
I'm good.

1485
01:29:41,816 --> 01:29:44,185
A little sore,
but I'm on the up and up.

1486
01:29:44,318 --> 01:29:45,553
Hmm.

1487
01:29:46,621 --> 01:29:49,090
Well, first birthday party

1488
01:29:49,223 --> 01:29:50,925
in the new house. Check.

1489
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:54,494
- First glass of wine on the front steps.
 -Check!

1490
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:57,965
What else is on the docket?

1491
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:00,701
I got a few little things.

1492
01:30:01,269 --> 01:30:02,670
Practice exam,

1493
01:30:02,803 --> 01:30:04,504
-certification.
-Wait.

1494
01:30:05,373 --> 01:30:08,009
Are you telling me that
you're not yet a legal teacher?

1495
01:30:08,142 --> 01:30:09,744
More art shows...

1496
01:30:11,379 --> 01:30:14,015
...probably a bunch of
teenage angst before summer.

1497
01:30:15,716 --> 01:30:16,918
So much to do.

1498
01:30:17,618 --> 01:30:19,120
So little time.

1499
01:30:20,354 --> 01:30:21,889
We have plenty of time.

1500
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,494
But there is one thing
that can't wait.

1501
01:30:27,628 --> 01:30:28,996
Oh, yeah?

1502
01:30:30,665 --> 01:30:32,333
We've got to get on those weeds
in the back.

1503
01:30:32,465 --> 01:30:34,302
- No!
- Yes.

1504
01:30:34,434 --> 01:30:36,469
No. No way.

1505
01:30:36,604 --> 01:30:37,905
Can we just ask
your mom to do that?

1506
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:40,473
No. She'll tell us
to get a new yard.

1507
01:30:42,209 --> 01:30:43,177
Ugh.

1508
01:30:43,311 --> 01:30:44,879
I miss the loft life.

1509
01:30:46,814 --> 01:30:48,950
Cheers to pulling weeds.

1510
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,119
No.

1511
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,921
How about...

1512
01:30:54,689 --> 01:30:56,223
...here is to...

1513
01:30:58,926 --> 01:31:01,028
...our new little normal.

1514
01:31:03,864 --> 01:31:06,033
So long as you're happy
with that, Daze.
